this seems to be a double standard in Washington when it comes to talking to Russians Democrats want to destroy Attorney General Jeff Sessions because he forgot he had had a couple of meetings with the Russian ambassador but many Democrats have forgotten their meetings with the Russian ambassador as well attempts to reach the ambassador for comment were fielded by his wife who said she had never met him so he may just be a forgettable sort of person Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed there was something sinister about Republican meetings with Russian officials but then photographs emerged showing Schumer sharing Krispy Kreme Doughnuts with Russian President Vladimir Putin when Schumer was asked about the photographs he burst into tears and said that the Statue of Liberty was crying because she loved Krispy Kremes so very much Schumer is demanding that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate any slanders against Krispy Kremes he says the entire Trump administration should resign to protect Krispy Kremes reputation for deliciousness senator Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill scoffed at Jeff sessions for saying he had met with the Russian ambassador because of his work on the Senate Armed Services Committee but tweets later revealed that she had met with the Russian ambassador because of her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee McCaskill later clarified that unlike sessions who said he had forgotten those meetings she had forgotten those meetings so it was completely different Barack Obama whose Justice Department seems to have been investigating Trump's ties with the Russians was also shown to have ties with the Russians but Obama's spokesman said these were just official meetings during which the president promised Vladimir Putin he would weaken America's missile defenses after his last election when he would no longer have to lie to the American public the spokesman said Obama later proved his dedication to defending America against the Russians by gutting our military and facilitating iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons so that's okay then other Democrats who said they hadn't met with the Russians include House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi who said she couldn't remember any meetings with the Russians or where she parked her car or what her name was or how all these dead bodies had gotten into her apartment there was also Senator Dianne Feinstein who said she had never met with the Russians but now she she had had a few meetings with Russians but only to discuss cooking recipes and to exchange photographs of the grandchildren and American nuclear installations president Donald Trump meanwhile countered charges that his administration had colluded with the Russians during the last election by making the outlandish claim that the Democrats had bugged the phones at Trump Tower Trump's absurd claim was made during a private phone conversation with his wife Melania and later released by sources within the FBI trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right it's mailbag day yeah yeah yeah all your questions answered if you're on Facebook or YouTube you got to come over to the daily wired.com and listen to mailbag day you could watch if you were such a cheap someone so and you would subscribe lousy eight bucks a month and then you would get to be in next week's mail back which is a little uncomfortable but while you're there you get to answer ask your questions we answer them your life has changed if so fact though whatever I don't know what that means but I just michael Knowles's book our cultural correspondent Nobel Prize winning cultural correspondent Michael knows his reasons to vote for Democrats a completely completely blank book is now number six on the Amazon bestseller list so Michael Knowles is now not just a Nobel Prize winner not just a multi Oscar winner and a Pulitzer Prize winner he is now a troll God has changed I clearly Shapiro and I are doing this whole book thing wrong by putting words in them I think Knowles has captured the spirit of the age inside the covers of this book get your copy now while they're empty otherwise somebody might put words in them and then though these for those of you who like words Ellery Queen mystery magazine world's leading mystery magazine which it is the new edition has a short story by me called all our yesterday's and you can get that for I think three bucks on Amazon you can get that copy it is the March April 2017 edition but it does have words in it so it's a little tougher than Knowles's unbelievable that is unbelievable that he did that good on him is a troll and now we have to respect him now that's never mind that's sorry know what thought when fleeted threw my head for a minute but that's ridiculous all right so what's going on I actually do want to talk about double standards yeah I just have to mention this this WikiLeaks thing that came out yesterday this incredible blast of information so obviously we have a spy or of some sort or traitor in our intelligence operations who released to WikiLeaks all this material about the way the our intelligence guys gather information and it turn out they can take over the internet of things right they can take your iPad and watch you they can watch you through your Apple TV they can listen to you on your iPhone hopefully they're only doing this to the bad guys but they can do it to anybody and not only that they can infiltrate your computer and make it seem as if the Russians had done it so now we don't know who know who fish actually nobody hacked the DNC you know they fished the DNC they got they caught John Podesta on a fishing expedition he sent them his email address or than that I think and that's how they got into him but now we don't even know if it's the Russians anymore so pretty soon they're gonna be accusing Donald Trump of consorting with Americans you know that's gonna be the new thing I can see it how many Americans did you talk to and did you talk to the American ambassador well I'm president United States that's no excuse anyway so this is everything is getting much much more complicated to talk about I really do want to talk about this whole double standards thing because this is this week has just brought this to a fore when we talk about fake news this is what it means it doesn't mean this story is untrue or that story is untrue it is the double standard by which things are treated so for instance when the guy from time I think it was said the Martin Luther King bust had been taken out of the Oval Office oops no somebody was just standing in front of it you know Chuck Todd and all these journals just shrug that off as if that weren't an incredibly incendiaries thing to say that you would never have said about a Democrat in office so now we have this thing Trump you know they they hammer Trump with all this empty stuff about the Russians they have it's all smoke no fire and people keep saying it's a lot of smoke there's that much smoke you know I mean I don't know what they've got but they don't have anything sub substantive and Trump shoots back this thing that I was bugged Obama bugged me in Trump Tower and listened to scary spicer the president's spokesman get hit by CNN and ABC News he's giving a press conference on the new health care bill and they come out with this thing on the bugging president made a very serious allegation over the weekend and I think we would all be remiss if we went through this briefing and not try to get you on camera to at least offer us some evidence where is the evidence where is the proof that President Obama bug President Trump well I answered this question yesterday on camera on your air so just so we're clear I know this is now B twice but I think I've made it clear yesterday yesterday since yesterday nothing proved no it's not a question it's not a question of new proof or less proof or whatever it's the answer is the same and I think that which is that I think that there is a concern about what happened in the 2016 election the House and Senate Intelligence Committee have the staff and the capabilities and the processes in place to look at this in a way that's objective and that's where it should be done and frankly if you've seen the response from especially on this on the house side but as well as the Senate they were they welcomed this and so let's let the Senate do their job and the house excuse me intelligence committees and then report back to the American people the president would draw the accusation does he have any any was drawn until it's I mean until it's adjudicated that's what we're asking is for them to look at this and see if there is no so so he's getting the third degree basically over this thing but who is giving the Schumer the third degree over his radio show we can go on and accuse Trump obsessed specially accused Jeff Sessions of essentially being a Russian spy and nothing nobody peppers him with questions like that now here and some of this is coming from Andrew McCarthy at National Review terrific he's obviously a former federal prosecutor he's gonna be on the show next week and he's the guy who put the blind Sheikh away but he's now become this absolutely terrific writer for National Review and he pointed this out that here's a New York Times story from January 18th American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of president-elect Donald J Trump including his former campaign manager Paul Manafort current and former senior American officials said so this was put out as a way of branding Trump this story was the York Times a former newspaper branding Trump by saying who they're investigating him for communications with the Russians American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and so they're saying he was bugged they're saying he was bugged now if if he wasn't bugged you know then there's no Russian story right I mean they're ideas there's a Russian story because the feds were investigating him so if he wasn't bugged there's no Russian stories if he was bugged they haven't come up with anything so why was he bugged and listen to listen to Josh Ernst remember the last president and his name was his name Oh I can't recite that like a terrorist I can't remind my former press guy Josh earnest talking to Martha Raddatz right and and listen she actually she who is a partisan reporter on the left she actually goes after him to try and get a denial out of him listen to him weasel out of it President Obama's former speechwriter John Favreau your former colleague who tweeted I'd be careful about reporting that Obama said there was no wiretapping statement just said that neither he nor the White House ordered it can you categorically deny that the Obama Justice Department did not seek and obtain a fight a FISA Court order what I could categorically denied Martha is that the White House was at all involved in directing or interfering or influencing an FBI investigation that's not what I'm asking what I'm asking is I'm and you deny that the Obama Justice Department did not seek and obtain a FISA Court ordered wiretap of the Trump campaign it was a cardinal rule here's what here's that simple answer that question is Martha I don't know and it's not because I'm no longer in government the fact is even when I was in government I was not in a position of being regularly briefed on an FBI criminal or counterintelligence investigation the White House known at the White House including the president United States should be in a position in which they're trying to influence or dictate how that investigation is being conducted do you know whether the president was ever given information about surveillance at Trump Tower what I can tell you well first of all I'm not aware of all of the details of how the president was briefed by the FBI but what I can tell you is the president was not giving marching orders to the FBI about how to conduct their investigations he was not asking for regular updates on FBI investigations and let me just stipulate one more time you have to ask the FBI whether there actually is an investigation into mr. Trump there's such weasel stuff because again as I said before this is the meddlesome priest rule you know the president doesn't have to call up the FBI and say investigated Trump he just has to let it be known that that would be a good thing or have some of his people let it be known and off they go and he knows look you know Loretta Lynch was one of the most blandly sinister public officials we ever had nothing that went on and that in her Justice Department was unpolitical Eric Holder same thing it was all political it was an absolute scandal the way the Obama Justice Department was run and if they were bugging Trump Tower Obama knew if they were but you know that is almost guaranteed and I'm not saying he ordered it he didn't have to order it so all I'm talking about is the difference in the way these stories are covered CNN is basically putting up headlines that says the Trump falsely claims Obama bugged him or Trump you know unsubstantiated claims but never Schumer's unsubstantiated claims or Pelosi's and substantiated claims about Jeff Sessions or or Obama or the contacts with the Russians absolute trash it's just I'm just talking about the double standard so now we've got this health bill come out and you know this health bill I'm of two minds about it you know it's obviously got a lot of problems it is a little bit of Obamacare light I'm not I wonder if maybe I think that Trump has to have a law they have to have passed something out of that starts with this law and I'm hoping it'll be changed both Paul Ryan and Tom Price the health guy are saying there's a three pronged process by which we're gonna get rid of Obamacare this is the first prong I think you know they're gonna have to do something and I hope they do but it's got problems so off it goes it to be debated and all this stuff but let's listen to the way Pelosi Pelosi he goes on and she just says this is the worst bill ever there's nothing good about it she said what did she say play play number four you can hear what she says just when you think you've seen it all the Republicans go to a more extreme place this will make millions of people it's a question of 10 15 20 million people off of having health insurance it will be the biggest transfer of wealth from low and middle income people to wealthy people in our country you don't think of it that way that's why we say to them show us the numbers show us the numbers about that but the impact is personally on people show us the numbers as to how many people will be thrown off it is real it couldn't be worse if she doesn't know the numbers how does she know it's gonna be the biggest transfer of wealth if he doesn't know the number I mean this is what I mean this is like logic on the face of it if she doesn't know the numbers how does she know it couldn't be worse or whether it's great we know she she has no idea she doesn't know yet but she just goes out and says it but here's the thing that really gets me they asked her about Obamacare okay and here's what she says is number five before you have to take it back to before and before we had the Affordable Care Act which is what I call it and with all the respect in the world for the president before the premiums were soaring if you could even get insurance and if you had a pre-existing condition you couldn't the Affordable Care Act in some instances there will be some increases not across the board but in some instance there will be increases but nothing to compare what it would have been without the Affordable Care Act and the coverage is far superior all of the benefits so the goal of the Affordable Care Act was to do three things to improve benefits to expand coverage as to who was included and to lower cost it has succeeded in every one of those things every word of that is untrue and those guys that reporters just sit there and listen to it the Affordable Care Act is collapsing and when the Republicans come out and say the Affordable Care Act is collapsing they are only speaking the truth as the as if you said the sky were blue okay why is she like this you know she sits there without challenging it no Republican making a länder statements like that would be unchallenged would go unchallenged and they just sit there nodding hey I gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but but the mailbag is coming all your problems will be solved so come on over to the Daily wire calm and listen and subscribe Hey
