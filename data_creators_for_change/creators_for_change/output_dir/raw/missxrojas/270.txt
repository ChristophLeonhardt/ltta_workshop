00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,350
a big part of my dissertation at the end

32
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,910
of university was about reverse there's

00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,649
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a stigma around mental</font>

36

47
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,150
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read this I was getting</font>

48
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,500
really bored of reading books and rated

49
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,720
by boys and about boys and just very boy

50
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,909
heavy so I was quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> skeptical going in</font>

51
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,890
but I really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> loved it if I had to</font>

52
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,750
revisit<font color="#E5E5E5"> second to school and pick your</font>

53
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,520
main theme of this book I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

54
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,020
was definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> brotherhood and loyalty</font>

55
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,490
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also think a lot about this</font>

56
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,350
reminds me of<font color="#E5E5E5"> The Wizard of Oz the l</font>

57
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,000
frank<font color="#E5E5E5"> Baum but can I guess in many ways</font>

58
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,890
the film and you should depend but with

59
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,990
zombies to every statement of mine so

60
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,030
it's an exploration of heroism but with

61
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,770
zombies<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exploration of brotherhood</font>

62
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,689
but with zombies an exploration of

63
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,369
military culture but with zombies

64
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,409
there's even like ear zombies I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

65
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,759
zombie person either the only things I

66
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,040
like a zombie course by John Green<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

67
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,409
also liked zombieland because it has

68
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,689
emma stone in it and she's best person

69
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,820
in the world or sue Bill Murray I really

70
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,140
thought the end games was great it was

71
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,759
two brothers running away from home and

72
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,979
that plan getting slightly altered by

73
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presidents of zombies very much</font>

74
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,160
voting German very much a coming-of-age

75
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,959
story but with zombies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it the</font>

76
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,280
one I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't like out the way a</font>

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,440
working theory of love

from the journals of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Neil's late</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dad who</font>

89
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,800
committed suicide really great premise

90
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,630
really great hook it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out</font>

91
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,330
to be whole book a bowl about Neil and

92
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,980
all about how his marriages failed and

93
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really dull in that all the women</font>

94
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,020
are such cardboard cutout characters and

95
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,700
they're so not interesting and all his

96
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,170
little epiphanies about those characters

97
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,750
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't like in any way</font>

98
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,490
establishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was really fully</font>

99
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,430
realized women and just generally I

100
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,530
didn't have any interest in Neil I

101
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,840
didn't have any interest in what he was

102
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,730
taking from this experiment with his

103
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,980
father's memory so I do like things that

104
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,410
are hopeful in some sort of small way

105
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,320
that was more story to be taken from

106
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,230
such a great idea of having a computer

107
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,270
be filled with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the memory as a few late</font>

108
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,380
father like I I was not so satisfied by

109
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,420
this I guess but in more positive news I

110
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,980
popped by penguin recently and they gave

voice of it was really similar funny

140
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
enough that's actually what the person

extra railway station thinking of

158
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,290
paperbacks and dreaming up a penguin

159
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,850
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sort of book that he'd want to</font>

160
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">publish which is so appropriate because</font>

161
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,240
this books published by penguin so you

162
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,980
know it works but that's picture me gone

flash of what it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's a slightly</font>

165
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,740
younger Paper Towns I would say but if

166
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,900
you're older then that's ok as well but

167
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,070
it's also got something of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Skellig</font>

194
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,680
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on in the book one of the</font>

main characters in this book as a

character called<font color="#CCCCCC"> kwaku is a surgeon and</font>

197

<font color="#E5E5E5">the night goes into the living room and</font>

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,260
see so far the fallen asleep on the sofa

about the slippers he has his huge

baskets of them and tries to make

205
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">everywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slippers all the time on this</font>

206
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,320
occasion and his feet are bare on the

207
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,570
sofa and she looks under the soles of

208
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,190
his feet for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font>

209
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,110
they're blistered and burn the<font color="#CCCCCC"> narration</font>

210
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,490
reveals that this is from a childhood of

211
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,470
walking Bertha in Ghana but it's

212
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that she's never seen before</font>

213
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,830
something that from the tops of his feet

214
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,450
which was clean and in pristine

215
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,800
condition and in these

216
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,479
because you'd never know it's the first

217
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,180
time tyro understands at least the first

218
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,860
moment that we see how I understand she

219
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really know her dad in any way</font>

220
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,580
it also becomes quite a crucial point in

221
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,500
the novel and in all their lives anyway

222
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,909
so that's gone on the Moscow by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Titus</font>
