1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,550
he's threatening to effectively change

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,009
the First Amendment he's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,750
CNN it cites he worried about that at

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,290
all not<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think that's a</font>

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,920
serious thing I we should all worried if

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,509
anybody's going to change the First

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,510
Amendment and remember the Democratic

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,960
Party had a campaign plank to change the

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,090
First Amendment and they were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the guise of campaign finance reform</font>

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,369
and that was worrying me more because

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,969
the press tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss that because</font>

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,579
they tend to lean that way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> therefore</font>

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,899
they were supporting what they were

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,300
viewing I think overly charitably as

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,969
something in cleaning up money in

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,829
politics when in fact what it would do

18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,170
is restrained multiple voices<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

19
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,460
thought the threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the First</font>

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,469
Amendment came from the Democratic<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,969
more I think there's not going to be a

22
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:00,000
serious effort on the Republican side
