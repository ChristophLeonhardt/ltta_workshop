the federal government has responded to hurricane Harvey and they've done it swiftly and to be quite honest with you they have allocated the necessary resources to ensure that lives are saved and people are rescued so first I want to make a point about Mike Pence versus Donald Trump Mike Pence seems to be taking the situation very seriously as he should in fact the White House announced that Trump will visit Texas but he'll do so tomorrow on Tuesday Mike Pence said the following I know the president the first lady have been very anxious to come to the area to see firsthand the efforts that are underway he's deployed the full resources of the national government people can just be confident that as we move through this rescue operation that we're there for a lot for the long haul we're there for the long haul with Texas through this recovery effort but now is the time to focus on life-saving efforts also Donald Trump tweeted about the storm and the tweets seemed almost a little celebratory and self congratulating and they were met with criticism let me share them with you he said wonderful coordination between federal state and local governments in the great state of Texas teamwork record-setting rainfall okay he also continued to say wow now experts are calling Harvey a once in a 500-year flood we have an all-out effort going and going well finally he says historic rainfall in Houston and all over Texas floods are unprecedented he spelled precedented right Wow and more rain coming spirit of the people is incredible Thanks so look the the resources from the government have been allocated to Texas as they should be however Christina Wilkie who's an investigative reporter tweeted out something that I thought was a little interesting I wanted to share it with you guys so Mike Pence was in the Situation Room working with officials in regard to the response to this storm and for some reason Donald Trump wasn't there he was at Camp David so there's the tweet in question now he was Donald Trump was also tweeting about NAFTA in queen tweeting about what was happening with hurricane harvey he was complaining that canada and mexico have been extremely difficult in the negotiations over nafta and then he says that he might terminate any agreement with them whatever but mike pence seems to be taking it a little more seriously than Trump and Trump was also asked about the situation in Texas and here's what his response was take a look okay so look I have different reactions to different parts of this story first off on the government reaction I don't have enough information yet to be able to say what went right and what went wrong so we obviously know that eight lives have been lost thirty thousand are stranded and there's been some great stories about how there's been rescue efforts some of them led by governments including local state and federal and then there's been great acts of kindness all over Houston so I think the jury's out on that both for good and bad so I'm gonna leave that be for now in terms of the trumpet Camp David by himself look more than anything else is symbolic it's a president who's isolated not part of the decision-making now I know what people will say there so no I mean he's dialing it in he's literally phoning it in and he's part of the process but he's just so obsessed with every weekend he has to get away every weekend he's got to go to Mara Lago or or his Golf Course in new jersey or wherever and so he's on yet another retreat he's all by himself everybody else is taking this super seriously I mean he doesn't have enough sense that even on the optics hey maybe I should have my sleeves rolled up and be in the situation that's right exactly I completely agree with you now in terms of what I know the federal government has done so far they're about five thousand FEMA employees on the ground in Texas trying to help out which is great the National Guard is involved so based on what we know now it seems as though the federal government is taking it seriously and they are allocating the appropriate resources to respond to the situation however responding is one thing but what we're doing right now is we are putting a bandaid on a gushing wound as genk had mentioned earlier in the show these extreme weather conditions are becoming more and more common we're seeing them every single year and so at this point you would think that we would have appropriate you know methods or strategies in place to mitigate these situations before it happens and unfortunately it doesn't seem like we do so just to give you an example after the terrible situation occurred in Charlottesville President Trump decided to give a speech on how he plans on improving infrastructure during that speech there was a tiny little component of it that that I think a lot of people missed and luckily Jonathan Larson who is the TYT news editor brought it to my attention so Obama in 2015 had signed an executive order known as the federal flood risk management standard and it essentially indicates that any type of government federal government infrastructure project or building project would have to meet certain standards to help prevent severe damage due to severe flooding well Donald Trump decided to come in and and say no I don't like it he wants to scrap it the Obama era rule gave federal agencies three options to flood-proof new infrastructure projects they could use the best available climate change science they could require that standard projects like roads and railways be built two feet above the national 100-year flood elevation standard and critical buildings like hospitals be built three feet higher obviously because of raising water levels right or they could require infrastructure to be built to at least the 500 year flood plan the order did not regulate private development but Republicans kept complaining about it oh my god this is gonna hurt businesses this is gonna be too expensive well what do you want to do because right now we have rising sea levels we have extreme weather conditions we're not doing anything about climate change we just pulled out of the climate of the Paris climate agreement and so we're gonna have more and more of these floods and so how does it make any sense to scrap this executive order by Obama the only reason why Trump wanted to do it is because he just wants to do the opposite of anything Obama did no rhyme no reason no logic so there's a couple of elements to this number one Republicans always complain about regulation well that's regulation you know why when another piece of regulation is in areas prone to earthquakes like in California you make the building's to the best of your ability earthquake proof so that they don't immediately crumble when you get hit with an earthquake and then you make them be able to withstand stronger strong earthquakes now if you don't have that regulation in place earthquakes will hit and thousands of people will lose their lives on the buildings crumble in this case in areas that flood you need these kind of regulations so there's so we reduce regulations that means I'm not thinking and the rule that Trump pass was for every new regulation that's passed you have to take away two regulations think about how blindingly stupid that is I'm not going to consider what the regulation is I'm not gonna look at hey does that one make sense is that one not makes sense how much does it cost what is the benefit I'm just against it against what it depends on the specifics so we don't yet know whether the government did enough after the storm but what the entire rest of the media is missing is what the government didn't do enough before the storm whether its regulations like that or fighting climate climate change in the first place so this administration has done nothing to help the people of Houston avoid this mess in the first place so we have brought William Brock along who's an administrator here administrative the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA he said quote we have not seen an event like this you could not draw this forecast up you could not dream this forecast up that's actually not true scientists have been telling you for decades now that exactly these kind of severe storms would happen and when they did Republicans came in and yes they are Republicans who are guilty let's not mince words the mainstream media won't tell you that don't I can't tell one side is against doing send me about climate change the other side wants to do something there's one is clear some issues are not clear this one is absolutely clear so as severe storms hit it is Republicans that are at fault for blocking any action on climate change so the scientists told you this would happen and what a Republicans do they brought in snowballs to the Senate or boat still so snows let's not do anything well you don't do anything and then you get storms like this so the good people of Houston we're going to try to help you because we actually believe in working together we think that's the whole point of government that doesn't mean that government can't do anything we the government does a lot of things wrong one of the things they did was they left you out there all by yourself they didn't do any action ahead of time to make sure the storms didn't get too severe and that was Republicans who did that so know who caused this to you anyone who tells you otherwise it's just they're advocating their responsibility they'll say we're biased no those are facts that is science so when you call it neutral I can't tell I can't tell was it Republicans or Democrats well you're not a journalist you're a neutral Pravda reading news actor whose job is to say uh I I don't know the news I don't know facts I don't know sighs gee which side want to do something about climate change you wish I didn't I can't figure it out if you can't figure it out you shouldn't work in news we know what went wrong here and by the way Abbott added one last thing that was weird he's the governor of Texas and I got no love Fermi's and the same exact voters other Republicans but as Trump is gonna come visit somewhere way away from usin legitimate point about hey we don't want I mean if you're in the research operation is a big deal when the president comes in and a lot of preparation that's totally fair he also had I didn't say this Abbott said it he also said that he will not be getting into harm's way so make sure that I mean it's raining out and you said so look he doesn't live in those homes the homes already got flooded and they're gonna get flooded worse there's no harm the Trump could get into but now those be careful Donald doesn't want to get into harm's way for God's sake at least go to the Situation Room at least pretend to get involved if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young
