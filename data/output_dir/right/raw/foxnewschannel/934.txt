00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:08,822
THANK YOU.

2
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:10,691
>> Laura: JOINING US NOW FOR

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,028
INSTANT REACTION IS

4
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:15,496
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, MEMBER

5
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:17,231
OF THE HOUSE AND -- EXCUSE ME, I

6
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,367
ALWAYS THINK OF YOU AS THE HOUSE

7
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,503
IMPEACHMENT MANAGER.

8
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:25,639
SO YOU HEARD A TIDBIT THERE,

9
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:26,640
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,210
>> A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,078
THAT SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN AND THE

12
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,646
UNITED STATES.THE SUMMIT WENT

13
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:34,114
WELL AND WORK TOGETHER BEHIND

14
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:35,049
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

15
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,684
NOW IF MY DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS

16
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:38,319
MIGHT GET BEHIND

17
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,386
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE MAY ACTUALLY

18
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:40,788
GET A PEACE DEAL.

19
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:42,056
WE LENT SOME OF THEM ARE

20
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:42,890
PROGRESSIVE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

21
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,759
AND THEY HAVE COME OUT, KIND OF

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,294
SHOCKING, AND SOME OF THEM FOR

23
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,629
THE IMPEACHMENT OF TRUMP.

24
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,131
THEY THOUGHT, LET'S GIVE PEACE A

25
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:51,465
CHANCE.

26
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:54,835
A LOT OF THE REAL CRITICISM

27
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,103
COMMENTS FROM CHUCK SCHUMER OR

28
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:57,004
OTHER REPUBLICANS, SOMETIMES

29
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,839
THEY THROW YOU IN THAT MIX.

30
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,674
BUT I SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE.

31
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,843
>> I'M A BIG FAN OF

32
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:03,644
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

33
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:04,477
HE INHERITED A PROBLEM THAT'S

34
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:05,946
BEEN BUILDING FOR 30 YEARS,

35
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:07,715
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR HIM TO KICK

36
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:08,682
THE CAN.

37
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:09,583
20 YEARS AGO THEY DIDN'T HAVE

38
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,652
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NOW THEY

39
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:12,086
HAVE A BUNCH.

40
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:13,187
THEY HAVE A MISSILE THAT COULD

41
00:01:13,187 --> 00:01:14,755
HIT NORTH AMERICA AND IF THEY

42
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,691
MARRY THE TWO UP, WE ARE IN

43
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:18,125
TROUBLE.

44
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,128
HE'S BEEN SAYING, I'M NOT GOING

45
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:21,762
TO LET NORTH KOREA HAVE A

46
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,831
MISSILE THAT COULD HIT US.

47
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:24,832
THAT'S A NONSTARTER.

48
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,433
I WILL OFFER THEM A DEAL THAT

49
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:30,971
THEY CAN'T REFUSE OR SHOULD

50
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:31,338
REFUSE.

51
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:34,408
COMPLIMENTS TO THE PRESIDENT.

52
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,010
I HAVE A BROTHER WHO HAS LIVED

53
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,244
IN KOREA FOR MANY YEARS, AND

54
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:38,646
HE'S STILL THERE.

55
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:40,748
HE SAID GATHERED AROUND A LITTLE

56
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:43,817
VALID VILLAGES, PEOPLE ARE

57
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:44,151
RIVETED.

58
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,853
LIKE EVERY SHOPKEEPER HAD A

59
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:46,287
TELEVISION ON.

60
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:49,623
HE SAID, LET ME TELL YOU.

61
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:50,391
TO THE SOUTH KOREAN PEOPLE, THIS

62
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:56,597
IS LIKE GORBACHEV AND REAGAN.

63
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:58,099
THIS IS POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN

64
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,967
THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THEY HAVE

65
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:01,035
FAMILIES AND NORTH KOREA.

66
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:02,970
THEY WANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT

67
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,605
SCENARIOS NOT JUST FOR PEACE AND

68
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:07,041
SAFETY BUT FOR THEIR CULTURE.

69
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,442
THEY ARE A VERY PROUD PEOPLE.

70
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:14,815
>> THEY      THERE ARE OVER 2 ML

71
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:14,849
>> THEY      THERE ARE OVER 2 MI

72
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:15,650
>> THEY      THERE ARE OVER 2 MN

73
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,385
KOREAN AMERICAN FAMILIES.

74
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:18,052
PRESIDENT AND I HAVE TALKED

75
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,688
ABOUT THIS AND HE WOULD ONLY

76
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,024
HAVE A WAR IF HE HAD TO.

77
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,625
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE A

78
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,827
DECISION, HE'S NOT GOING TO

79
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,229
CONTAIN A NUCLEAR ARMED

80
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,929
NORTH KOREA BECAUSE THEY WILL

81
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,931
SELL WHAT THEY BUILD.

82
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:34,035
HE WILL BRING THE PROGRAM TO END

83
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:36,037
IN A WINNING WAY.

84
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:37,538
BUT DEMOCRATS, I ASK YOU ONE

85
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:38,673
THING.

86
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:40,841
TELL THE WORLD, NORTH KOREA AND

87
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:41,842
CHINA, THAT IF DIPLOMACY FAILS

88
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:45,046
BECAUSE THEY PLAY THE SAME OLD

89
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:46,747
GAMES, ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE

90
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:49,150
TABLE AND GET BEHIND

91
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,617
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

92
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:50,318
>> Laura: AT RAND PAUL SAYS

93
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:51,852
YOU ARE A DANGER TO THE WORLD

94
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:53,721
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT.

95
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:54,822
BUT OF COURSE AREN'T MILITARY

96
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:56,357
OPTIONS ALWAYS ON THE TABLE?

97
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:59,226
>> IF NOT WE WILL NEVER GET A

98
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:00,695
DEAL, I NEVER WANT TO USE IT.

99
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:02,897
THE BEST WAY TO GET PIECES TO

100
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:03,597
CONVINCE NORTH KOREA WE WILL

101
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:06,400
HAVE A WAR THAT THEY CAN'T WIN.

102
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,535
TRUMP IS DOING EVERYTHING HE

103
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,904
KNOWS HOW TO AVOID A WAR AND I

104
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:11,472
WOULD BEG NORTH KOREA AND CHINA

105
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:12,673
TO TAKE HIM UP ON IT.

106
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,075
>> Laura: IT JUST CAME OUT

107
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,077
BEFORE YOU CAME ON THAT THE

108
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,679
PENTAGON IS EXPECTED TO CANCEL

109
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,513
THE AUGUST MILITARY EXERCISES

110
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:21,015
WITH SOUTH KOREA.

111
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:22,850
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THAT OR

112
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,454
IS IT TO SOON TO CANCEL?

113
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:28,155
>>  IF THE PRESIDENT CALLED ME

114
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:29,256
ON AIR FORCE ONE AND HE SAID,

115
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:33,027
LET THEM KNOW I'M SERIOUS.

116
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:33,894
I'M WILLING TO STAND DOWN TO

117
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,497
GIVE THEM THE SPACE THEY NEED TO

118
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:37,665
MAKE AN INTELLIGENT DECISION.

119
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:39,433
WE CAN ALWAYS PUT THE EXTRA SIZE

120
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,336
BACK ON SCHEDULE BUT THIS MAY BE

121
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:44,238
THE LAST BEST CHANCE IN OUR

122
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:45,106
LIFETIME FOR PEACE.

123
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,041
THIS IS A BULL MOVE FOR THE

124
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:47,675
PRESIDENT.

125
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:50,244
WE WILL NOT WITHDRAW OUR FORCES,

126
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:51,846
AND WE WILL GIVE NORTH KOREA A

127
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,248
SIGN AND BREATHING SPACE.

128
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,584
TO THOSE WHO CRITICIZE THE

129
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:57,351
PRESIDENT, HOW WELL DID YOU DO

130
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:00,254
IN NORTH KOREA?

131
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:00,922
>> Laura: SO YOU CRITICIZE

132
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:03,591
THEM FOR HOW MUCH IT COST TO DO

133
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,625
THESE INTERVIEWS.

134
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,627
I WATCHED YOU THE OTHER NIGHT, I

135
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:08,429
DO MY RESEARCH ON YOU.

136
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:10,097
YOU SAID IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO

137
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:11,432
QUESTION HOW MUCH MONEY IT

138
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:12,233
COSTS.

139
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,501
BUT I KIND OF LIKE THE FACT THAT

140
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,102
THE PRESIDENT IS ALWAYS WORRIED

141
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,070
ABOUT THE TAXPAYER MONEY,

142
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,838
WHETHER IT'S MONEY THAT WE GIVE

143
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:20,241
OVERSEAS TO COUNTRIES THAT TRASH

144
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:21,442
OUTS, OR -- I'M NOT SAYING

145
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,243
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

146
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:25,313
BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE

147
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:26,447
LIKE, GOOD, HE'S LOOKING OUT FOR

148
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:26,948
OUR MONEY.

149
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,916
>> THE NUMBER ONE JOB FOR THOSE

150
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,917
IN THE CONGRESS AND THE

151
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,118
PRESIDENT FOR THE MILITARY TO

152
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:34,021
GIVE THE TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT

153
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:38,960
THEY NEED, BUT, THAT'S SOMETHING

154
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,794
WE DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT.

155
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:44,198
>> Laura: IT'S INCREDIBLE

156
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:44,231
>> Laura: IT'S INCREDIBLE      I

157
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:44,265
>> Laura: IT'S INCREDIBLE      C

158
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:44,298
>> Laura: IT'S INCREDIBLE      E

159
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:44,332
>> Laura: IT'S INCREDIBLE      I

160
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:44,365
>> Laura: IT'S INCREDIBLE      L

161
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:44,599
>> Laura: IT'S INCREDIBLE      Y

162
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:50,071
IMPORTANT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

163
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:50,504
28,000 HOMES.

164
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:53,207
>> IF WE PULLED THAT OUT, CHINA

165
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:57,912
WOULD MAKE THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.

166
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:00,448
AND THEY ARE BEGINNING TO BACK

167
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:00,815
OFF.

168
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,618
IF YOU PLAY TRUMP, YOU MET WITH

169
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:04,652
HIM, YOU SHOOK HIS HAND AND TOLD

170
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,621
HIM HE WANTED TO GIVE UP YOUR

171
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:07,855
NUKES FOR A GOOD DEAL.

172
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:10,358
IF YOU PLAY THIS GUY, YOU WILL

173
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,193
REGRET IT.

174
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:13,628
THIS IS NOT BARACK OBAMA.

175
00:05:13,628 --> 00:00:00,000
>> LOOK AT POOR JUSTIN, THAT WAS
