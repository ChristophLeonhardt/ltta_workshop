US lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union are raising the alarm over Amazon's facial recognition tool that's after it falsely matched photos of members of Congress with criminal mug shots prompting calls for a moratorium on its use by law enforcement an identification whether accurate or not could cost people their freedom or even their lives Congress must take these threats seriously hit the brakes and enact a moratorium on law enforcement use of face recognition the American Civil Liberties Union compared photos of all the members of the US Congress with a large database of criminal mug shots Amazon's facial recognition tool made 28 matches all of them were false now 11 of the mismatches involved people of color prompting additional concern now the union claims the tool has an in-built racial bias saying the false matches were disproportionately people of color a 40% of the mismatches involved people of color who also make up 20% of the people in Congress we spoke to technology analyst Roger Kay about the issue when the software is trained to recognize faces it has to train on a corpus and the corpus is made up of lots of images of people and if for whatever reason the images are mainly Caucasian people then it will be better at recognizing them and at some of the minorities if they weren't well represented in the training sample so I think that's the technical side of it in May the ACLU revealed that Amazon is trying to sell its facial recognition technology to government and police agencies and that led to more than a 40 civil liberties groups to join together in calling for that not to happen even Amazon workers joined the protest however the technology has already been tested in some US police departments the next of course common use case as you could expect is Public Safety Hamazon is already working with government agencies to deploy this technology at the ACLU we obtained records that show that Amazon signed a secrecy agreement with one County to keep details about the technology out of public view they've also invited law enforcement to suggest new features and they offered free consulting to help the City of Orlando build its own system amazon has hit back of the ACL u 's test though saying that it should have employed a higher confidence threshold setting which motors the probability of an accurate match Amazon recommends a 95 percent but the ACLU claims Amazon used only 80 percent while 80 percent confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs chairs animals for other social media use cases it wouldn't be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty when using facial recognition for law enforcement activities we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95 percent or higher from Amazon's point of view what they said was it they train their law enforcement clients not to use the software for making decisions but rather to narrow down the pool to where the human can look at the final results and verify yes these do make sense these are the same people or they're not the same people so they're saying that a human being should still be involved even with a very high confidence level that the images match so I think that's another piece of it you
