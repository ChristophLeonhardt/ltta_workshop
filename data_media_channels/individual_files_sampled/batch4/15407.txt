so today we have a story about a statue of President William McKinley in Northern California in the city of Arcadia and we've got a small faction of people outside the town who have a problem with it and want it removed why because as they say he was a proponent of settler colonialism that savaged raped kill blah blah blah now that's a pretty serious charge and not entirely inaccurate however it's a chicken and egg scenario because it wasn't just American settlers who were trying to stake their claim on land here in America and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a few minutes but how far is this going to go shouldn't there be some sort of number some quantifiable minimal amount of people required not just some entitled fancy-pants City Council people making the decision for a minority of people whose feelings are hurt I remember a few years ago I was chatting with a college kid and my old place of work prior to the election and I don't remember what led to this statement that he made but he said something to the effect of America doesn't even belong to the US it belongs to the natives you guys stole it you guys killed all the natives first of all you guys you guys this kid was born here in the States born in Los Angeles went to Hollywood high school now he goes to UC something I don't know there's about a thousand of them state franchise education yay but he was born here his parents came here illegally I don't know what their legal status is it doesn't really matter but they were enjoying the spoils of living here in the United States so Oliver if you're watching I'm just gonna give you a few little facts Kate all right so we didn't kill all the natives when our ancestors arrived here they touch down after a near apocalypse in the decades between Columbus's discovery of America and the Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock the most devastating quake in all of human history spread across native territories two years before the pilgrims started colonizing the plate wiped out about 95% of the natives in Massachusetts the plague would eventually swoop all across the West killing at least 90% of the native population as a whole enough for comparison's sake the Black Plague killed I think between 30 and 60 percent of Europe's population so no it's not because of us that the Nate population came very close to extinction and to be honest if that plague hadn't happened we probably wouldn't have acquired the land but it did and we won and to the victor goes the spoils so but let's get a little bit further into this narrative about the United States of America is stolen land blackfish the leader of the Shawnee tribe and one of the most relevant leaders of all of Native America massacred hundreds of American settlers on land actually owned by the French and a tiny little piece of it formerly owned by the Spanish whoops so fine we eventually moved into land that black fish and the Shaunie's claimed was theirs but in fact it was rightfully acquired by the u.s. in the greatest real estate deal of all time the Louisiana Purchase Trump would have been very proud so you can be pissed at America all you want for that but you can really thank Napoleon because he's the one who sold it to us but the native aggression reached a boiling point when a Shawnee war party abducted three women outside of the frontier settlement called Boonesboro yes that's Boonesboro as in Daniel Boone one of those women was his daughter Jemima Boone now this was the first instance that we know of but certainly not the last of natives kidnapping settler women and children it was a very common occurrence oh and by the way they also captured settler men and sold them to the British human trafficking and slavery what so then there was the Battle of Fallen Timbers a battle which frontiersman won handily but was provoked by the natives and then there was the Native Americans known as the Red Sticks who attacked Fort Mims in Alabama killing almost all its defenders and many civilians as well it's known as the Fort Mims Massacre and it was the worst slaughter of white settlers by Native Americans in the south and shifting to another narrative about tearing down monuments there's there's the argument that no one should have a statue made of them all right if we're going to go by that standard no more saints and churches no more prophets no more depictions of Jesus Christ or Allah or Buddha we're done yeah but that's not okay sure everyone is created equal but they don't remain that way some people use the opportunities given to them to make better lemonade the lemons that were given some people stick the lemons in a pipe and smoke away their opportunity some people feed some people rape and some people like William McKinley fight against the enslavement of blacks and become President of the United States so forgive me if I'm cool with throwing up a hunk of iron or concrete to commemorate the achievements of great men and women and sure McKinley had some small little splotches on his record fine so did Martin Luther King jr. he's got plagiarism and adultery on his record so should we bulldoze his statues - hmm no and you would be surprised to know that in fact there are very few monuments left or right and statues that I'm in favor of demolishing Hitler yep Mussolini yep Stalin yep Robert Mugabe yep but we've got to draw the line somewhere here's what people have to realize today you might be successful in tearing down the monument that you don't like but tomorrow there's gonna be another group of people who are going to want to tear down a monument of something that you care about so pick your battles inanimate objects depicting someone who did a lot of great things with maybe a few not great things wrinkled in between leave them alone and those are just my thoughts thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us over here
