leftists love to play the I can't believe you're even upset about this game here are the rules left to say or do something totally outrageous and stupid for example they say men should be able to use women's restrooms or maybe they say that kids should be forced to learn about homosexuality in public schools conservatives then respond by saying this stuff is insane what are you people out of your minds what the hell is wrong with you leftists then feign horror that Republicans should be so upset about these issues why are they so upset why can't you just be tolerant conservatives are just so angry all the time yeah we're a little pissed or pissed the hint leave characters that we already know and love alone or pissed that you won't leave us alone make your own icons you jerks today's episode of I can't believe you're even upset about this comes courtesy of Hollywood on twitter the hashtag give Captain America a boyfriend is trending this is master level trolling by leftists they want to take an iconic American comic book character originally directed at children and teens and make him a homosexual moreover they want to make that character who's supposed to be an embodiment of 1940s traditional morality and masculinity an advocate for 2016 leftist social values so Captain America for people who don't read comic books he was encased in ice while fighting against Hitler he's released from the ice like Rip Van Winkle decades later and his old-fashioned love of America and belief in traditional moral values makes him an anachronism that's why he's an interesting character he's described in some of the later day comics and the ones they do now as sort of John McCain and a thirty year old body now the left ones Captain America to stop fighting fascism instead they want him fighting to protect the world from Christian Baker's the left knows Captain America is iconic to three generations of Americans and so they're looking to troll the right by conflating his American flag shield with the rainbow flag and if conservatives say Captain America's traditional mission and personality which by the way includes protecting traditional families and his own traditional love interests we've always been women if they believe that's skewed by turning him into a parochial champion for gay rights then we're the bigots right we're crazy the left wants to simultaneously claim that being gay changes nothing about a character but that it's desperately important for characters to be gay and they hijack already popular characters to do it instead of inventing new characters nobody cares conservatives don't care that they made Iceman from x-men gay but people have a right to expect that the characters with whom they've identified for the last 60 years ought not be changed at the whim of the left according to the left however popular characters can be shifted just on a dime leftist will trot out the actor who plays Chris Evans who by the way hates me to say that it wouldn't matter if Captain America were gay that would be awesome they already did that with Mark Hamill and Luke Skywalker which by the way would make his original love triangle with Han Solo and Princess Leia even weirder than it already was and it already included incest leftists are now calling for Gillian Anderson to be cast as James Bond yes a chick to be cast as James Bond which makes zero sense given that Bond's entire MO is that he's an ultra masculine womanizer a woman picking up and having promiscuous sex with sophisticated men isn't a spy superhero that's a normal Tuesday night in a dive bar the roguish charm of Bond relies on the differences between the sexes that Bond is a seducer right he's seducing women which is actually conquering right but he's counter-intuitively also a man of honor that conflict doesn't exist for women and ain't hard for women to conquer man all she has to do is give him a time and a place when it comes to pop culture the left cheats McCants invents a gay Captain United States or a female Jane bond because those characters wouldn't be as popular as Captain America or James Bond so instead they'll try to steal those characters and twist them to fit their agenda it's annoying it's actually a betrayal of both the characters and the audience listen we didn't buy the Captain America tickets because we wanted to see him make love to Bucky and we didn't buy James Bond because we want to see some sort of metaphor about female empowerment it's boring but the left won't stop and they won't stop complaining if anybody challenges their stupid irritating and moral attempts to destroy the character as we once loved i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show tends to demonize people don't care about your feelings so I have a new theory about America and that is that we have now been trolled into absolute insanity we've just been trolled into insanity we've lost our minds because the left has lost their mind and just a quick further note on Captain America there's nothing wrong with saying that Captain America who's supposed to be a traditional representation of masculinity yes it changes the representation of masculinity if the guy is gay because part of masculinity is the idea that you're going to father children and that you're going to protect those children and protect women it turns out men don't need other men to protect them as a general rule women do this is because women have less upper body strength gang it's because they're genetically different from men Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman when a man protects another man it's not the same thing as man protecting a woman everybody knows that and that's why so many traditional heroes are straight right because the idea is a man saving a woman is something that actually happens in real life that's actually something that's necessary in real life go to countries where men don't protect women and see how well the women there do right freedom is based on the notion that men are honorable protect women make children with women that they love and who love them in consensual fashion and then protect those kids that's what civilization is based on so yes that's a slightly more important story to Western civilization and to individuals than a dude having sex with another dudes so yes it makes a difference to character and character development what kind of masculinity your is tempting to portray and the same thing is true in the bond context I mean the idea that you're gonna make a female James Bond it doesn't work on any level on any level it doesn't work because the whole point of bond is that he's seducing these random beautiful women and as I said earlier a woman seducing a bunch of guys you could be Meghan Trainor and seduce a bunch of guys right I mean as Amy Schumer is fond of saying it isn't hard for a lady to catch a bleep right at a it ain't that tough the idea of with with bond is that who is the stutter sky that he can get all these beautiful women nobody's asked her ever asked a beautiful woman how is it that you can get all these stutters guys I wonder really as a toughy okay so here's the thing the left has made everybody so nuts with their crazy trolling that we end up with just a crazy politics we've all lost our minds I think the greatest success of President Obama and the modern left is that the right absolutely went bonkers and so now we have a bonkers left and a bonkers right fighting with each other for bonkers America and the pet the sad part about all of this is that normally when empires destroy themselves normally when when great when great civilizations destroy themselves is because we reached a low point all the pain all the troubles America's had in the past our actual troubles like for example slavery a trouble we had a civil war right World War two a trouble we had a giant world war today which bathroom should we use let's have a huge war and fight each other and destroy each other and destroy the country and kill all the things the country is founded on because we need Caitlyn Jenner to be able to whip it out in a lady's room okay this is what how you know we've gone nuts is that there's not even an underlying conflict that's so grave that it requires this kind of insanity and anger and rage but that's that's where we're going anyway anyway so speaking of the trolling the latest elements of the trolling it we're gonna we're gonna show you the left strolling and the left scrolling is what has created our crazy politics so let's start with yesterday yesterday there's an officer named officer Nero he's one of these officers in Baltimore who was who was arraigned by the by be politically motivated prosecutor been brought up on charges in the death of Freddie gray Freddie gray was a 26-year old career criminal he was arrested after he was carrying an illegal knife and ran from police he was put into the back of a police van he was not buckled in right he was handcuffed but he was not buckled in apparently then in the back of the van he was sort of banging on the back of the van and they stopped suddenly and he fell over and he and he the the momentum of the stop pushed his head up against the back of the van and he and he broke his neck and he ends up dying from that a little bit later and so they tried to try the cops they tried to claim that the cops originally the first they tried to claim that they murdered him right they tried to claim that they brought him into custody and just murdered this guy for no reason by the way most of the cops are black they then tried to claim that it was purposeful negligence that they were that it was manslaughter that they didn't care if this guy got killed and that's why they didn't buckle him in in reality the the new orders excuse me that you were supposed to buckle in prisoners that only changed about a week prior to the to the actual incident so this officer was acquitted they said it's clear he didn't mean to kill Freddie gray no it meant to kill Freddie gray it's a terrible accident it's really bad that it happened but that doesn't mean that they purposefully pushed him down in the van then rammed his head against the back of it or that they didn't buckle him up knowing that he was gonna break his neck I mean honestly if we're gonna prosecute everybody in America who doesn't buckle up and then somebody gets killed you're gonna be prosecuting an a lot of people it turns out that most people who don't buckle up it's because they forget and they're in an older car that doesn't have the beep-beep in this particular car you know it's in the back of the van they don't have that system in any case megyn kelly had on black lives matter leader - ray McKesson ceramic cousin isn't he's a troll so when we talk about trolling DeRay McKesson is a troll he's a guy he's had no career at all he became prominent in Ferguson when he started tweeting about all of the evil terrible things why people were doing in Ferguson and the federal law authorities and the state authorities and the police and he became very prominent because he was tweeting a lot and he gave up his regular job to become a full-time troll and we're Marty McFly's vest from Back to the Future except in blue and that's he always wears this he always wears the the thing where it looks like he jumped ship like him back to the future and and DeRay McKesson is now a national figure it's funny because he ran for mayor of Baltimore this year he won less than 0 votes people who are not yet born voted against him he drew I think is 1% of the vote in Baltimore which is where he's supposed to be popular so he's on TV and Megyn Kelly's talking to him listen to the level of delusion from Ray McKesson and then you wonder why people are going nuts this is why people are going nuts and who caused it and how remains to be seen but you're these cops did it and I'm telling the audience thus far the evidence doesn't support that what I'm saying is that there's one trial so you don't know what the evidence in other 5 cases in neither do I and that's why I'm excited - followed by a jury and it was and it was a hung jury so they were not able to conclude the next case that was tried by an African American judge concluded that there was no case against this case just watch our next five and that's important I will see the next five babies do that you have a not guilty verdict against officer Nero you continue to tell this audience that he did something wrong no what I continue to say isn't I'm looking forward to the administrative review and that we do need to take a holistic look at the laws in the state of Maryland what are you in Maryland in Baltimore City it is OK for officers to hog-tie and chokehold citizens we don't think that that is okay so you look at that but what did officer Nero do so I've already said this to you me and I said this officer was involved in this case and what it says what the judge said is that the officer was not criminally responsible and this means that we need to continue the fight to make sure that the laws hold officers accountable he had no responsibility as noted in the judge's decision today to intervene when he saw others misbehaving and that is important we should know he did ago okay megyn kelly is totally right if you read what the judge said he didn't say that he didn't say there was wrongdoing but the lodge can't hold this guy responsible what he found is that there's no evidence than anybody had done anything wrong that this was an accident accidents are bad tough you know that that's that's sad but that's that's life and Freddie gray by the way did resist arrest and Freddie gray we had a long criminal record which doesn't mean it's good that he got killed but this idea that they just hogtied an innocent guy and then and then basically beat him to death which was the original narrative that isn't true but it doesn't matter right facts when conflicting with the left they don't matter Dre McKesson says this guy basically should have been prosecuted anyway even though he can't name a single shred of evidence the guy did the guy did anything bad so there's that right and then and then more troll so there's this professor who was on MSNBC live he's a Morgan State University assistant professor dr. Lawrence Brown and he's talking about the same Baltimore case listen to what he has to say about policing in the United States you mentioned that there was an african-american judge we have a black mayor we had a black policeman but you know American policing was founded on slave patrols this system of policing has been always exacting disproportionate violence against african-americans throughout the history of this country so I don't think that you know people here who are living in the communities where there's a high level of police aggression a high level of police brutality they're not going to be happy with this I think there's going to have to be a lot of discussions about the criminal justice system right here in Baltimore Maryland whether or not it can in fact deliver justice for people living in disinvested redlined black community so remember prosecutors are used to working with the police so is it even possible that they're going to deliver the best case that they can deliver that they're going to be the strongest prosecutors they can this is nutcase stuff so to the police in Baltimore by the way our majority black there was a black police chief of black prosecutor a black mayor a black Attorney General a black the United States and majority black City and a majority black City Council all of that is because originally policing was slave patrols okay I'm not sure if this professor is aware of it but police existed in the north too it turns out that police have existed all across Western civilization for literally more than a millennium right so this idea that there were no police like this is not it's nonsense but again he's just throwing out terms like we need to fix the criminal justice system to do what to do what what happened here that was so egregious in the criminal justice system right what what happened here that was so terrible and so you watch this and you just get mad because he's not speaking the language of reality this is crazy we're being gas lit again not a single shred of evidence this officer should have been convicted but he wasn't and so they wanted to string this guy up they want to lynch this guy because he is a because he is a bad guy and he therefore deserves it because he's a cop and when he complains about policing in the inner city in Baltimore again majority police force that is black in Baltimore people in Baltimore need more policing not less policing there are too many criminals in Baltimore so the trolling continues and then there's more trolling from the left so it's just there full time trolls they live under a bridge and they robbed the travelers of their money their full time trolls David Gorgon on CNN who's is a big fan of the Clintons David Gorgon from CNN he was speaking about the North Carolina bathroom law for example and here he's talking about the North Carolina bathroom law that says that men should be able to whip it out in front of little girls in the bathroom but the signals coming out of the state capitol in Raleigh have sent a thunderous message rolling out across America that North Carolina is no longer a pioneer in advancing people of color people who are gay people who are living on the margins instead many here want to go back far back to a darker time this is not the place to relitigate each and every issue but what other message that state legislators think they were in sending what did they intend when they seriously restricted the access to voting embrace the constitutional amendment to deny equal rights to gays and lesbians place more restrictions on abortion okay so now he's listening off a bunch of things he doesn't like and he's saying that these are the same thing as not letting men into girls bathrooms right so you're looking at this and you're going you're out of your mind these people are out of their mind and then just put the capper on it joy joy behar who is just oh my god I mean it's like God took all the annoy he took all the contents of the Annoying jar and poured them into one human joy behar on the view she's making the case here that abortion is an affirmative good so again the trolling is just out of control the left has become more and more trolli back in the 1990's they used to claim that they didn't like abortion they wanted it safe legal and rare that was an incoherent position but at least it wasn't openly trolling Joy Behar says that she loves abortion abortion is an affirmative good shove an abortion certainly it's a woman's decision to make without consulting her husband that's the law disagree but I'm telling you if it was me and I wanted to do it that I'm yeah okay who tells me what to do it's my body I do what I want if your body but it's just it's also your spouse's child so I do not take that into consideration that your spouse's child as well it's my body just does that not tape but you don't take it that's my choice if I wanted to get my tubes tied in he and I had like a few kids already and he's like no let's just have sex I don't want to use a condom I'd get the tube side and not tell them that either without having the talk it's my tubes okay and this is this kind of stuff you look at this you know like you're missing the entire point of the conversation we're not talking about your tubes we're not talk about your appendix no one cares we're talking about the baby that's inside there and you just ignore the entire point and you've got all these other women there including people who are conservative supposedly I think it's Nicole Wallace over on the right I think and Jedidiah Bella in the center and they're both just going along with this to the extent that they're saying well you know shouldn't you at least consult your husband because it's his child too who that's not the question the question is easy at a child if it's a child then you don't get to just sit there singing it's my body it isn't your body it isn't your body it's another body is another person's body but so this trolling makes people insane so the trolling makes people insane and it leads people to the conclusion that no matter what these people have to be stopped and I understand this I get it I so get it I really do believe me I've spent my entire life fighting harder than you fighting harder than the Trump people the Trump people were giving money to these people Donald Trump gave money to these people okay I spent my entire life fighting the left my entire life fighting them and and yet we're now being told that if we refuse to stand up for Trump then we're doing something deeply wrong we're doing something terribly wrong dennis prager I keep mentioning him because I have so much respect for Dennis Prager as a moral voice Dennis Prager has a column today talking about his response to his conservative never Trump friends he mentions me by name as well as a couple of other people like Jonah Goldberg and Bill Kristol and Brett Stevenson George well and basically what he says in the end when he basically says is I could not live with my conscience if I voted to help the America destroying left win the presidency in any way I don't understand how anyone who understands the threat the left and the Democrats posed to America will refuse to vote for the only person who can stop them right only Trump can stop the left right now and therefore you don't have a choice but to vote for him okay totally get this argument totally understand the logic totally understand the emotion and I will say this I think and I've said this many times I know how many times I have to say it but I've said this many many times I fully understand and I sympathize with the position I disagree with the risk calculation but I sympathize with the position Donald Trump's a horror show he'll be better than Hillary I understand that and if you're an honest person who believes this then when somebody says Donald Trump's a horror show your answer should not be no Donald Trump isn't a horror show your answer should be yes and Hillary is a worse warrior show right that and that's that's perfectly acceptable when Donald Trump does something wrong you call it like you see it but you say he's so better than Hillary I get it that's fine when I'm beginning to see in the movement and this is the trouble right this is where I say that conservatism is now being perverted the conservatism is being taken over by Trump that the body snatchers have arrived is people who are moral voices not saying yes Trump is a horror show but he's better than Hillary I'm seeing people say what Trump isn't so bad no Trump isn't so bad and when you wouldn't make accusations against him when you say negative stuff about him she's not true we'll just ignore it we'll pretend it doesn't exist there's a tendency for every human being all human beings there's a real tendency to just get rid of difficult moral conflicts by making the other side of the moral conflict disappear right so if you're trying if you're a leftist and you're trying to say Syrian Muslim refugees should enter the United States and somebody says those people are a security risk well then the easy thing to do is say well no they're not a security risk they're not a security risk at all let them all in that would be ignoring the problem in pretending that something doesn't exist that exists I'm seeing the same thing happen with people who want Trump to be elected because it's very difficult to live with the psychological dissonance of saying Donald Trump is a bad man who will do bad things but he's better than the other person it's harder to live with so instead what people are beginning to do is advocate for Trump there's the difference between I'll advocate against Hillary and therefore vote Trump I'll vote Trump to stop Hillary and I want Donald Trump to be President those are actually two different propositions people are identifying these two things when people make the I'll vote a vote first Stalin to stop Hitler or argument when they make that argument understand that when we allied with Stalin to stop Hitler we were still fighting Stalin okay during World War two we were still fighting Stalin there's an actual competition for territory that we were going to control in the aftermath of World War two in the middle of World War two this is why there was a race to Berlin right the reason there was why not just let the Russians do it they could have sacrificed their lives the reason is we didn't want the Russians taking over Western Europe so there was a competition even then this would be more like the equivalent if you're arguing in favor of Trump as president not against Hillary as president so we have to use Trump cause he's our only vehicle but in favor of Trump as president you're now arguing that we should have made Stalin president to stop Hitler not that we should have allied with Stalin to stop Hitler but that we should have given him ultimate power and I have to say I think a lot of the people who are against who are yelling at those of us who are critical of Donald Trump understand something were the only thing that's leading Donald Trump to even pretend to care about you we're the only reason Trump is even pretending to care about conservatives because he's trying to consolidate us behind him and so he's making overtures to the conservative movement you guys already sold out you guys already said we're on board with Trump once Trump has he on board you're in the car he locked the doors there's no escape right the fact is that were the ones outside the car saying we're not getting in the car unless you pledged to do X Y & Z so even if you disagree with us you should be thanking us for pushing Donald Trump to the right okay all of that said I said that the trolling has driven Americans nuts particularly people on the right we've we've now gone full on okay well they're disconnected from reality fine screw it we'll be disconnected from reality - so Donald Trump is now coming out and he is attacking the Clintons not on the basis of real things he's now attacking the Clintons and on the basis of Vince Foster okay he's I'm the bassist of Vince Foster now for those of you who don't remember the 90s and I don't have a lot of listeners who are younger even than I am now I was only 16 when the nineties ended so yeah I understand for those who don't remember okay Vince Foster was the deputy White House chief deputy white House Counsel under the Clintons he was found dead in 1993 in Fort Marcy Park he'd shot himself in the head okay there are a lot of people conspiracy theorists who suggested that he had not killed himself that in fact the Clintons had killed him and the Clintons had taken him out and had killed him because he was involved in whitewater whitewater was a scandal about a corrupt real estate deal in Arkansas involving Hillary Clinton's rose law firm and and her husband the governor of Arkansas well now now we have Donald Trump and Donald Trump has come out and he has and he is trying to dredge up this this Vince Foster routine in order to attack Hillary Clinton and his bizarre kind of line of attack here his basic argument is that the Clintons probably killed Vince Foster he's not gonna say so but the Clintons kill Vince Foster and the way that he puts it is so typically trumpian it's just it's typical Trump because Trump is a conspiracy theorist but he never wants to own his conspiracy theories he always kind of want to just put it out there so I mean Donald Trump is a he's he's a Breitbart comment troll right and we've decided to to elect him president because again you want to let the Breitbart comment trail President to stop Hillary I get it don't tell me the Breitbart comment troll is anything but a Breitbart comment troll when that's what he is here's what Donald Trump said about Vince Foster and this is this is what it really is amazing so so he says that the Clintons have dodged all of this and then he adds let me see if I can find the direct quote because the direct quote is just too amusing let's see here it is he said quote it's one thing with her it's whether it's whitewater or whether it's Vince or whether it's Benghazi it's always a mess with Hillary Clinton and then and he continued by saying I love this one he said let's see that the theories of path of power play were quote very serious and the circumstances of Foster's death were very fishy quote he had intimate knowledge of what was going on he knew everything that was going on and then all of a sudden he committed suicide I don't bring Fosters this is so it's so Trump in I don't bring Foster's death up because I don't know enough to really discuss it I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder I don't do that because I don't think it's fair okay okay this is the equivalent of that in that passive-aggressive teenage girl who calls her friend says you know I'm not bringing up that I think you dress like a whore because because I know anything about I'm just saying people around the school they keep saying that you dress like a whore that you dress like a little hooker and you know I'm not gonna bring that up because I think it's mean but like people are just saying you dress like a whore okay the way everybody knows the teenage girl is saying you dress like a whore right I mean since the Donald Trump is accusing the Clintons of murdering Vince Foster but no he would never do I've never said and he provides himself the sort of bizarre Avenue out where if you say to him why are you throwing out conspiracy theories about Vince Foster then he says I'm springing up you know is that people were saying people who are these people people people were saying I hear from a lot of people a lot of people a lot of people say this a lot of people say this right and he did this routine if you recall he did the same routine about Ted Cruz's dad being involved in the Kennedy assassination I'm not bringing it up because I think it's real but the National Enquirer is said and I better tell you this you can believe me believe me they don't print things that don't have any substantiation you know this is this is Trump's routine so Trump is is throwing out these crazy things and people on the right are saying okay fine I know you're troubling us what will troll you it's kind of funny I mean honestly it's kind of funny we're we're kind of trolling we're drawing right and so Donald Trump and we're willing to go along with it because Donald Trump also says he's gonna fight dirty against the Clintons now I'll explain in a second why this is not beneficial but here's Donald Trump explaining why he's bringing up all these old issues against the Clintons I understand the Clinton attack machine I got it and I think it has to be dealt with someone but I think maybe Carly I don't like doing that I don't like doing that but I have no choice when she hit beyond things I just have no choice so you have to do it it's unfair and you know they're dirty players they've been dirty players historically and I have to fight back the way I have to fight back all right and then voters will make up their mind as I said if it's in context everybody I think will understand it but I hope you guys both just you're right I mean it should be issues right you and her on the issue would rather have policy and issues policy the idea that Donald Trump ever wants to discuss policy and issues yeah right yeah yeah I mean the last time Donald Trump saw message discipline or issue discipline yeah the last time Donald Trump saw discipline is when she was whipping him in a BDSM Club I mean like they've never seen discipline before so that he wants to talk about about issues is ridiculous but people give him the benefit of the doubt cuz he's attacking the Clintons they're trolling us let's troll him right back with Trump this is just rollory it's just joyful troll all right here's the problem if you're a person in the middle you're the person who's just watching this from the outside you're not an ardent trump supporter you say okay the wanita broderick stuff is kind of legit a woman actually accused him of rape they never dealt with it it's actually an issue and then he comes back with his Vince Foster stuff and foster wrote a 27 page suicide note okay Vince Foster committed suicide because he didn't like being embroiled in this particular scandal so he shot himself when if you are going to be an attack dog like Trump is and that by the way this is the part of Trump I like in part from I like is the attack dog that's the part I have always liked this go back listen to the show from the very beginning I've always liked Donald Trump attack dog it's my favorite part of Donald Trump here's the problem if you're an attack dog if this is what you do if you and one day you hit Hillary Clinton with the frying pan that is Juanita Broderick right you hit her right in the face of the frying pan okay good if the next day you hit her with a rubber chicken like Vince Foster I just take out a rubber chicken you're smacking her with the rubber chicken people are going to assume you're a clown because you just hit her with a frying pan and now you're hitting her with a rubber chicken and that's sort of what I think I think Trump is actually discrediting himself here by making a tax that that are not relevant just this political advice stick to attacks that are actually stick worthy don't just throw things out there because you haven't taken the time to actually research but again trolls on the left bear trolls on the right and so here is a Trump staff or explaining that when Donald Trump is talking about all these scandals from the nineteen ninety he's actually doing he's actually doing the Clintons a favor here is Donald Trump surrogate Michael Cohen Michael Cohen is also the guy who is called Donald Trump is patriarch and he's and he's on with Chris Cuomo here he is talking about how Donald Trump is actually trying to help the Clintons he defended Bill Clinton for years he said the same allegations that you guys are talking about now we're a waste of time we're wrong were hollow that Bill Clinton was a terrific guy that he was a great president that the impeachment was wrong that it was a waste of time and Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump was one of the smartest best businessmen in the United States on several occasions now she's attacked on these ads socially Bazo so she's bad too so but is he bad for saying the seasons great now going after all he's doing is he's giving the facts no no he's giving the ferno's the facts then in the 90s when this was all happening he said he was alright us he was a private citizen who was friendly with the Clintons and he had to protect a friend all right now it's a different game it's 2016 my the presidential miking is the Republican presidential you decide to run for office and people say hey you know Cuomo back then used to say always deny them you say but now I'm running against them for most abundant it's it okay absolutely come on if I'm a-goin the chief if I was telling the truth then it's Absalom he's not lying he was protecting a friend is that different so again this is troller II of the highest level right so we've got the trolls on the left and now we've got Donald Trump's people out there saying well yeah he was defending the Clintons from all this stuff in the 90s but that was just as a friend now he's really mad about it now he's really upset about and he thinks it's worthwhile so troller ii from the left brings troller ii from the right and so now we're just a nation of trolls that's all we've we've become the the troll dolls and we have trolls all hair candidates and it's just it's a disaster all the way around all this has also created some an alliance and some very odd alliances and this is why it feels like the nuclear bomb of politics is hit because people are finding themselves in camps of people they never wanted to be with or or liked before so now all of a sudden you've got Newt Gingrich who's ripping MIT Ron which wants to be Donald Trump's VP is ripping Mitt Romney and he's in the exact same camp he's in the exact same camp as Alex Jones so Alex Jones is a full-on conspiracy theorist false flag guy every time something bad happens in the United States he says it's a false flag for the government to grab more power he said it about Sandy Hook he said it about a number of things he's a real conspiracy theorist he and Donald Trump are on the same side which means that he and Dennis Prager are on the same side I means that Alex Jones and Dennis Prager and David Duke and Newt Gingrich are all on the same side it makes for some very weird bedfellows right it makes for weird bedfellows because this is what campaigns do but the weirder the guy top the weirder the bedfellows right David Duke wasn't prominently in support of Mitt Romney Alex Jones wasn't prominently in support of Mitt Romney right but they are certainly in prominent support of Donald Trump and this is creating some very weird bedfellows and on the other side we've got some weird about fellows too so I'm somebody who have said I can't vote for Donald Trump for all the reasons I've expressed a thousand times I can't vote for Donald Trump as it currently stands if he changes maybe all change if there's new evidence maybe I'll change my mind I've said that and now I'm on the same side as people I can't stand like John Huntsman right John Huntsman is saying he has concerns about Trump here's the former Utah governor speaking presumably in English not in Mandarin Chinese as he did in one debate I have said that I'd support the party's nominee and he is our party's nominee and so therefore I try to look for the good certainly I have I have concerns about some of the things he said and stylistic approaches but then I say okay he has a unique opportunity to bring together constituencies under the Republican banner that really have never been joined before maybe to bring back the Reagan Democrats to bring folks into politics who have become disenfranchised and feel that the system doesn't respond to their needs anymore so to the extent that he can counter a mood of cynicism you know that that's probably a healthy thing in politics and we'll see I mean the campaign is just ramping up and it's not because I'm sorry John Huntsman apparently is on the same side is all the rest of that crew but the people who are on my side so here's the worst example of a person who's supposedly on my side and this is again we reach a point in politics where you have to make difficult choices the easy thing to do is minimize the difficulty of the choice so on the one side the people who support Trump you have people minimizing the risk of trumpism the risk of front-row Lori and conspiracy theorizing and big government the risk of Donald Trump telling people that they ought to hit protesters and telling people that he wants to change the First Amendment and telling people that he doesn't see any moral conflict between Israel and Palestinians and telling people that women believe from there wherever and telling people that it's okay to mock the disabled and POWs you have people minimizing all that on the one side because they like Trump and on the other side you have people like David Brooks David Brooks I cannot stand David Brooks his work I think David Brooks is not a Republican I don't think he's a conservative I think David Brooks is just some guy who works for the New York Times who they call a conservative because they don't know what a conservative looks like if the conservative came up and punched them directly in the jaw so David Brooks has a column today and he's a guy who doesn't like Trump like me his guy doesn't like Trump but I like trying I just like Trump for good reasons David Brooks dislikes Trump because David Brooks is basically a Democrat so David Brooks comes out today and he writes a column in which he openly praises at length he openly praises and talks about the absolute wonders of Hillary Clinton right he actually comes out and he praises at length Hillary Clinton and what he says about Hillary Clinton is that she is quote unquote warm and caring those words David Brooks says okay which makes him the first human being to ever say this ever right what he actually says this is what he writes today he says she has dedicated herself to public service from advocate for children to Senator she has pursued her vocation tirelessly really I mean she actually laughed about defending a child rapist she is endlessly corrupt I'll talk in a second about her corruption because there's a bunch of it that's breaking in the news but Hillary Clinton is super-duper-duper corrupt and David Brooks is now defending her so when I say that that conservatism is easily corrupted that is true from both sides the Trump people corrupt conservatism if they are willing to say that Trump is a conservative and overlook all of his flaws as a human being and as a candidate just to back him the same thing is true on the other side if you say Trump is not a conservative because he's not Hillary Clinton if you say that that what we really want conservatism really is is what David Brooks thinks it is you're just conservatism if you say conservatism really is what Donald Trump says it is you're destroying conservatism conservatism is neither of these two things conservatism is the set of ideas that actually founded the country and have nothing to do with creased pants for David Brooks or strongman politics from Donald Trump all of this is really I mean look it's difficult to talk about this stuff and it's very disappointing to talk about this stuff if you don't think that there are folks like me who are you know look who are desperate to rah-rah our guy it's much more fun to be a cheerleader than it is to be somebody who goes to a game and and has to critique both sides because you're trying to be honest about the principles of the game but I can't but I think it's important that we do that you can still vote for Donald Trump critique him by the way as I've said you can still say Donald Trump is all these bad things but at least he's not Hillary Clinton that's an honest argument I even agree with it somewhat but you can't make the case that Donald Trump is the new face of conservatism and not say that he's not corrupting conservatism because that's utter sheer ridiculous garbage and meanwhile Hillary Clinton still can't despite all the trolling from the right Hillary Clinton is one of the left's trolls and so she is trying desperately to to claw her way back into this race and I really think the momentum is not on her side Hillary Clinton is struggling to respond here's Hillary Clinton going after Donald Trump standing in front of the SEIU which is a major American Union what little we know of his economic policies would be running up our debt starting trade wars letting Wall Street run wild all of that could cause another crash and devastate working families and our country trump economics is a recipe for lower wages fewer jobs more debt he could bankrupt America like he's bankrupted his companies okay sweetie I mean ask yourself how can anybody lose money running a casino really okay this is it we tweaked T week T because people look at Hillary and they say you made all your money speaking in front of Goldman Sachs very weak T and speaking of corruption you can't accuse Donald Trump of being corrupt when you're Hillary Clinton everyone who has ever surrounded Hillary Clinton was probably in risk of going to jail okay the latest person who's at risk of going to jail is Terry McAuliffe Terry McAuliffe was he's now the governor of Virginia but he's a super duper duper corrupt fundraiser for the Clintons he raised two hundred seventy five million dollars for the Clintons during the 1990s he actually personally guaranteed the one point three five million dollar loan on the Chappaqua house that allowed Hillary to establish residency in New York he's super duper corrupt and now they're they're investigating the FBI is for his time as a board member of the Clinton Global Initiative right so he may go to jail over all of this but Hillary is supposed to be the non corrupt candidate Yeah right there's a reason why polls show that she's unable to rise above Trump and and his troller II so the trolling of America continues apace and it's not gonna stop anytime soon in things I hate I'll talk a little bit more about this trolling because this is the the the left has moved up from be from a party of principle to a party of trolling like Bernie Sanders isn't actually he looks like a troll but he's not actually a troll Bernie Sanders actually speaks mainstream left he speaks hardcore left thought right he actually speaks ideas they're really bad ideas which is why everyone thinks they're dumb but he speaks thought most of the left is now focused on this trolling politics we'll get back to that in a second first a quick thing that I like so I decide I'm gonna do kind of children oriented movies this week I can't remember whether I did this one or not I don't think so but deadly searching for bobby fisher' have a nun searching for bobby fisher' I don't think so said searching for bobby fisher' is a really really underrated film this is a film from the 1990s Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne and and it's about this this kid who's a child prodigy in chaste named Josh Waitzkin and who is a true story and it's about his kind of father struggles with competition and do you have to have a killer mentality how do you win without becoming a me bad person and it's really just it's a wonderful wonderful film really enjoyable here's what the trailer looks like get off - Josh - the car thing you play chess she doesn't know how to play chess doesn't even tie his shoes I'm playing chess my day it's a game with monopoly in a world that thrives on competition why do you want to send her play chess oh hi don't he does he taught himself in a game where when he means the world tell me is the next Bobby Fischer somewhere in this room a challenge has begun their son creates like Fischer he sees like him inside there playing not to lose Josh you've got to risk loose and you've got to risk everything I was wondering if he could keep him from playing their songs no gonna kill not to play in the park he loves it just makes my job harder Oh God my son has a gift he is better at this than I have ever been at anything in my life you have to have contempt for your opponents it goes if you don't think it's a part of winning your room okay you have to hate them they hate you they hate you Josh get us to put a child in a position to care about winning and not to prepare him is wrong I have the one this is the way it works maybe it's better to be the best it's a really good movie it's a really good movie and it's worth watching it's good for adults it's good for kids it's okay things I hate so back to the troll Ori so Hillary Clinton is now going to meet the female Ghostbusters she's gonna be on Ellen this is just more trolling if you mail those busters isn't it as in and of itself a troll so I can speak objectively on this because I hate the original Ghostbusters I'm one of the five people in America who thinks it's a terrible movie and and I can't understand for the life of me why people are so worshipful of it I think it's it's absolute garbage and tripe but people love this movie I know Lindsey Lindsey and and yeah Lindsey and Mathis both are about to leap the camera and strangle me to death but I don't like the original Ghostbusters so I can speak objectively about this no matter how much I dislike the original Ghostbusters there is no way it could possibly be worse than the new Ghostbusters this new all-female Ghostbusters this looks like this will be the worst movie ever made I mean legitimately the worst movie ever made so here is is the trailer for the new all-female Ghostbusters I think I've shown it before but since I'm going to subject you to all sorts of suffering on today's show here is the the trailer for the new Ghostbusters says 30 years ago for scientists save New York this summer a new team will answer the call there's a class for oppression that's okay she seems peaceful my name is Aaron Gilbert doctor of particle physics that's step one everywhere by the way in every crack very hard to wash off we have dedicated our whole lives to studying the paranormal now their sightings all over the city there are people out there that need our help Holtzman you're a brilliant engineer Aaron no one's better at quantum physics than you we can provide a real service I'm joining the club you guys are really smart about this science stuff but I know New York and I can borrow a car from my uncle the vehicle was gonna be a hearse this movie looks like death ride on a stick anymore this looks so awful in every possible way it looks awful and it's specifically cast female because female empowerment yeah okay so yes they've got this garbage with with uh female Ghostbusters now we're really showing the men that were equal to them by stealing their properties and pretending that were as good at it as they are and being inferior where this movie will be 78 percent as good as the original Ghostbusters is apparently the theory here and it won't even be that it'll be like 30% is good not even like the original Ghostbusters so they're doing that so what happens Hilary is gonna be on Ellen 2 - neither one of them have been with a man in years but Hilary is gonna be on Ellen's show with the female Ghostbusters because female empowerment yay and everybody who and this is the left strolling game again anybody whose appetite about this like did you make a movie specifically so that we'd vote for Hillary Clinton because if so if you took an original movie that a lot of people like I decided to make it crappy just to make a point about how Hillary needs to be president you're all stupid and annoying right if we say that sort of thing oh well you're why are you going so crazy it's just women playing Ghostbusters why you think women campy Ghostbusters I don't know screenwriters did you think black people can't be physicists apparently you think they're only street smart subway token operators right so the whole thing is just the left stroller a never ends the movie looks terrible Hillary interacting with these people at oh if it weren't for Hillary we would never have had a shot in life to be successful actresses because there weren't successful actresses until hillary was presidential nominee yeah whatever okay stupid stupid really stupid annoying okay plus a my only question really is if Hillary does meet the female Ghostbusters are they going to attempt to kill or capture her okay finally a final and final point about the left rolling so the Obama I will say this Obama has been a transformative president because his troll or he's a troll master level of 4d chess playing troll so here's just more evidence that Valerie Jarrett his right-hand woman she she does she doesn't interview on 60 minutes they profiled Valerie Jarrett and Valerie Jarrett is sort of the brains of the operation supposedly and they asked her about Obama's accomplishments listen to her list of Obama's accomplishments and see if you can spot the troller e I keep thinking of the president's elections and those posters that said hope change and in his final year in office where's the hope and the change you can't even get a Supreme Court nominee a hearing well the hope and change Norah doesn't come from Washington the new hope and change comes from the American people and the president's still extraordinarily optimistic about the future of our country I mean just look at what's happened in the last seven years our unemployment rate going from 10 percent down to five our automobile industry back ending two wars 20 million people with health care many for the first time okay you have a great deal to be proud of our accomplishments did you notice the mass of trolling there so there are a couple things that are truly right I mean first of all there's the Obamacare stuff all the prices are going up people are losing their doctors okay but the real trolling there is ending two wars ending two wars that's the real troller there there are still people being killed in Afghanistan King 73% of all casualties in Afghanistan have happened under this president and as far as ending the war in Iraq yeah that's been a real boon that's gone fantastically well as Isis takes over the top half of the country and Iran takes over the bottom half that's been just wonderful so this is why people people feel like they're being gassed let they feel like they're going crazy and so they go to the guy who says fine I'll gas LEM right back I'll just do crazy stuff look at me I'm a clown ha ha am i funny like a clown to you go get your shine box I mean that that's the that that's what this entire election cycle has become and as decent thinkers fall into the trap of supporting any of this they're just becoming part of the troll universe to a whole other universe filled with trolls wonderful and colorful trolls but trolls nonetheless and we'll be back to cover all of the troll eree and all of the fun and all of the horror and the zombie apocalypse that is sure to follow I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
