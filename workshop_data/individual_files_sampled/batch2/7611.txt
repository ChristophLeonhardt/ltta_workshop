for the past several weeks Austin and the surrounding area have been terrorized by a series of bombings of seemingly increasingly complexity and random randomness as well but today that appears to have finally come to an end police identified who they thought the the person responsible for the bombings was identified I believe a hotel that the person was staying in in Round Rock Texas and moved in to confront the bomber who was in a car and apparently detonated some sort of explosive as they approached and blew himself up the police also shot at him although there hasn't been any confirmation of whether that they actually hit him or that contributed to his death anything like that but that is the good news overall that they did find him he is now dead actually interim Austin Police Chief Brian manly said that they had broken the case in the past 24 to 36 hours using store receipts internet searches and surveillance footage to identify him which will have a little bit more on but if you haven't been following this story and we've been covering it pretty much every day here's a map showing how broad the the pattern of bombings is that you had originally sort of eat the east side of Austin a series of three bombings that looked like they were predominantly targeting prominent members of the black community in Austin then you had that spread a little bit you had the tripwire explosive in South West Austin you had two bombs one of which went off at a FedEx facility north of San Antonio and then you had this incident at in Round Rock yeah so great police work I had a sense that other did that his time was limited when he started using FedEx and I didn't want to be glib in new predictions or whatever on a topic like this but it's one thing when you leave unmarked packages on people's porches they don't have video cameras usually on their houses most regular folks don't right you start going to use facilities to send your packages this video cameras everywhere yeah I'm still very very impressed with them I mean granted they had 350 500 people on it which thank God they did but I mean I imagine it if FedEx just like how many people go in a given day like I still imagine it would be very difficult now one thing that contributed to it was that um apparently he ordered exotic batteries he ordered those online and used them in the explosives tracking those batteries which are apparently somewhat rare helped them to find him as well great detective work exactly yes yeah divorced from any politics I really really don't mean this in a political context the FBI from time to time does great work in tracking down terrorists they actually have a much higher percentage success rate in tracking out Muslim terrorists bless their hearts for doing that you know and and partly because of resources spent in that area but either way they have done sometimes phenomenal work in all the authorities here involved in tracking down people and preventing further terrorist attacks so credit where credit is due yeah there was actually I believe in Michigan I think it happened today it might have been yesterday a family reported one of it I think he was 15 years old a kid who they believed would do some sort of attack on a school and they got the kid and he had guns and bombs and he had been planning to do some sort of attack it I believe it was pawpaw was the name of the school but he was turned in and he was caught now in this particular case although the bomber is dead and that is the good news that doesn't necessarily mean that this entire thing is over they are considering the possibility that there could be accomplices although they do think that this individual was linked to all of the attacks that doesn't rule out the possibility of accomplices although there's no evidence of that at this point and there is also some concern that he could have set explosives before he killed himself although again there is no evidence of that yet but police are telling people in the Austin area to still be on the lookout in the near future just in case all right so now let's go into the identity of the bomber so it looks like we've got him he's a 24 year old white male by we got him I don't mean the fact that they killed him or he killed himself actually that is clear I mean that we have a sense of who he is so he apparently was a conservative now big caveat there they have a blog from this guy mark Condit and they believe that this is the same mark on it it's from 2012 so he's six years yeah so he was 17 at the time and and there he says he's a conservative but he also says I'm not that politically inclined and then something that I was weirdly haunting to me is in that blog he explained that he enjoyed cycling parkour tennis reading and listening to music and it just made it made him seem more human and of course not interested in it then yeah no but it was just we it's weird that this guy who was a terrorist and terrorized this entire city and we had to put three to five hundred you know police and and law enforcement guys tracking him like parkour and then it was saying tennis I've pictured him you know volleying back and forth and how does a guy living in the middle of Texas who seems like gonna have his random dude decide no you know what I'm gonna be a terrorist bomber and I'm gonna go a murder all these people perhaps we'll find out I mean we have what we believe are some of his writings I put on a few topics to try to get an idea of why he might have done this one of the areas was talking about how they bring in killers or something like that and obviously this is years before but like dude you but you became a murderer you were an indiscriminate person killing whoever you could I mean the later bombs I mean originally they were sort of something some somewhat simple explosives but the later bombs were were packed with nails and metal shrapnel to try to cause as much mayhem and destruction as possible yeah actually let me highlight the two of those well now seems glaring hypocrisy now that we know what he did what some of the posts celebrated a column by ultra-conservative fox news contributor mark CSUN but it look I don't put that on CSUN he's not a good guy I don't agree with him but he can't control everyone who reads his column that's crazy there's crazy people who read and watch all sorts of different things but the the reason I bring that up is because one that he really liked was how CSUN was talking about how dumb it was to ever release terrorists much less a senior one and it doesn't care what kind of it for me they could provide you must stop the terrorist the guy who liked that column turned out to be a terrorist but by the way I mean again it will find out a lot more in the coming days but based on the little information we have now wait for right wing terrorists they really don't believe that they are terrorists they think that that's just a Muslim thing and they like don't know what I murder people I'm doing it for because I'm a patriot and so to what degrees right winger we know a little bit here obviously based on this evidence to our degrees a terrorist is absolutely clear and in previous right-wing terrorists the guys who were looking to blow up the apartment building they thought the Somali immigrants lived in and the list goes on dozens and dozens of right-wing terrorists when you ask them to like terrorists what names so I was just going to murder people I didn't like for political reasons or religious reasons that's kind of a textbook definition of a terrorist yeah I mean last week we had those guys who bombed a mosque and tried to bomb an abortion clinic thankfully they didn't know what they were doing so the bottom didn't actually go off and in the case of the mosque thankfully no one was actually injured I wonder what they think do they know that they are in fact terrorists that they they specifically said they were trying to send a message to Muslims to get out of the country killing indiscriminately killing innocents to accomplish a political goal sounds like the textbook definition of terrorism I don't know if they understand that that's what they were doing we have more information about some of the things that he wrote but now that I'm thinking about I'm not even sure that I care as you said the quotes are old we could find out in the end that they weren't actually him although it seems pretty sure that they were and I think that we understand probably enough at this point perhaps more information will come out he like gay people he didn't think abortion was okay he sounds pretty socially conservative that's the long and short of it you just watch the video by the young turks the
