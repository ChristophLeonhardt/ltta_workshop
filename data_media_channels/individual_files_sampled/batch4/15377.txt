we already pay a sin tax for liquor tobacco and come July marijuana but if the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals gets their way you'll also pay a sin tax on meat so the animal crackers who comprised the ranks of PETA just hate being out of the new cycle so their latest crackpot idea is this according to a story in The Vancouver Sun PETA is calling on governments to tax poultry pork beef and fish as a way to promote a healthier diet and mitigate the environmental costs of meat production that's right all you meat eaters out there if you're going to violate animal rights and turn a blind eye to the environment by chowing down on that cheeseburger then PETA wants the taxman to receive his pound of flesh too so here's the deal eliminating meat from the human diet would be a net savings to the health care system according to PETA spokeswoman Ashley Byrne she claims meat eating is associated with cancer heart disease diabetes and obesity and reducing meat production would also be good for the environment says she quote a tax would place meat where it belongs in a category where cigarettes and alcohol because they are bad for human health and meat production is catastrophic for the environment hey miss Byrne what's your definition of catastrophic they don't call it beautiful British Columbia for nothing where's the catastrophe indeed according to the sons story ranchers in BC say environmental arguments focus only on the negative aspects of cattle production using global figures that don't apply in Canada and ignore the considerable benefits to water quality biodiversity and the sustainable use of interior grasslands that are provided by ranching indeed the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports that livestock contributes to 14.5 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions but in Canada that figure is only 2.4 percent there's also another hitch that PETA fails to comprehend cow flatulence aside most people love to eat meat look I don't know if I'm hurting the environment or not but damn it this is one mmm tasty sausage way more satisfying than Brussels sprouts just give me a moment to savor this and it's not just a matter of meat tasting good but meat is good for you as well although it's also trendy in certain circles to denounce meat and to go vegan due to health concerns the fact that is meat with us have its nutritional merits according to medical daily.com there are three big benefits when it comes to having meat in one's diet such as number one since meat contains a large amount of protein this could be beneficial to the body as the need for protein is said to improve overall health and well-being there are other benefits such as the repair and building of body tissues as well as the production of antibodies that will protect the body from infections thus strengthening the immune system number two of the many nutrients that meat contains meat is rich in iron zinc and selenium and number three vitamins are also a big part of one's diet and vitamin A B and D are commonly found in meat as well now not only do these vitamins promote good vision stronger teeth and bones but it also supports the central nervous system and you know folks you know what anecdote sticks in my craw as it pertains to diet and sports way back in 1992 the Buffalo Bills played the Washington Redskins and the Super Bowl the bills were put on a veggie intensive diet prior to the game while the Redskins remained meat eaters final score Redskins 37 Bills 24 and a think Buffalo is the birthplace of the chicken wing what heresy and here's another beef I have with groups like PETA why are they all about the stick and not about the carrot so many Canadians are already having a hard time bringing home the bacon these days thanks to the tax threshold that forever throbs upward what if a so-called meat tax is implemented well Canadians be reimbursed with fruit and veggie rebates in order to make this new syntax revenue neutral I don't think so you know the war on meat reminds me of New York City's attempt and soda cup sizes larger than 16 ounces the band championed by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was rejected by the New York State Court of Appeals in 2014 because the ban exceeded the scope of the city's regulatory authority but even if the large soda cup size band had passed would it really have worked if someone is so keen on gulping down more than 16 ounces of soda when that person just by two 12 ounce cups I guess the Mensa club members promoting the large cup ban never thought about that one in any event we all know what the end game is here when it comes to pitas beef with beef namely pita and their ilk really want an all-out ban on meat period so sorry PETA but to paraphrase the late great Charlton Heston I'll give you my sausage when you pry it from my cold dead hands for the rebel dot media I am David the benzine Benzies hey folks like what you just saw there and become
