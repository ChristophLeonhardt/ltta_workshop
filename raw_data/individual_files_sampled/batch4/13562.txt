all right it's time for our golden globe-winning cultural correspondent michael knowles sadden who is going to report on who is reporting from Christmas I believe from Christmas central is he wig I can't see him do we have them sweater you pulled your the old you know yeah go ahead the the little drew on my sweater is actually wearing a sweater with a little blue I had a nightmare like this once it just went on forever right that's right you have to you have to say where you got this sweater this is an amazing split it is incredible I saw it I actually I wanted to buy it as a prop a make your own ugly Christmas sweater but I don't have any artistic talent so I decided to bring the whole kit in to the only person who does any work around the Daily wire Cynthia angle oh man gr this is the she is the daily wire that's right and I and I asked her to do it I come in and she's working on it on her lunch break you spent hours on this sweater and I think really to great effect because we'll get you know a day of laughs out of it to my world-famous Christmas tree the best party of the season uh-huh alright you know we wanted to talk about the war on Christmas oh yes comes up every year and every year that the left tells us that we're out of our minds were being silly there is no war on Christmas so we sent you out into the field into Christmas to find out if in fact it is under siege that's right coming to you live from Christmas they always Gaslight us on this the very people who are clearly the ones changing the tradition and changing the culture of a Christmas culture to this generic boring clinical holiday sort of culture or the ones gaslighting us and telling us that we're the ones creating the trouble and the latest uproar is coming out of Texas because a middle school administrator in Texas put up a little display of Linus and a display from the George Brown Christmas special of Linus from the Charlie Brown Christmas special he had to take it down because of a jet√© ters about the separation of church and state really the tar and feathers in Texas Texas yeah and you know across the country there are Christmas trees have become holiday trees right and we did at least we got our Starbuck Starbucks cups back you know that was a victory that was a Christmas light victory in the war on Christmas they you know and what's so offensive about it isn't that it's you know no one's asking for the crash or the nativity scene you know Starbucks cup but if the little Christmas tree lights are so offensive to you if you have enough time to be outraged by the Christmas tree lights get a job and nobody you go into stores now nobody says Merry Christmas they say Happy Holidays that's right the way that you know that the war on Christmas does exist is go down the street or into a store or something and first of all see if you ever hear Merry Christmas you won't but say Merry Christmas and notice the reaction it is shock and like dismay you know you said something you've said something rude basically that's right and the question is that why do people say Happy Holidays if there's really only one major holiday at that time you know people might say well there's Hanukkah but Hanukkah is a holiday that really only came into fashion as we know it today in the mid nineteenth century before that it was the miracle of finding oil in the Middle East but it was actually there's a good story on NPR another fake news site about this which is that Hanukkah in its present form was developed by a rabbi in Cincinnati in the mid to late nineteenth century and it was a response to a increased commercialized Christmas and it was it was to keep kids kids from envying Christmas basically that's right I mean their version of Christmas what about Kwanzaa Kwanzaa yes merry Kwanzaa yeah I do have my Kwanzaa but I said it on fire I just wanted to see if it would burn and you know remain intact that's right the Kwanzaa is actually the most ridiculous one Kwanzaa was invented in 1966 by a convict by a criminal named Maulana Karenga who was an african-american studies professor at Cal State Long Beach okay and it was founded as a pan-african app an african-american socialist holiday but the word Kwanzaa derives from Swahili which is actually on the wrong coast of Africa all of the transatlantic slave trade took place on the west coast of Africa where they do not speak Swahili the and actually Maulana Karenga went to jail for torturing two women forcing them a strip naked and torturing them with electrical cords and a hot soldering that's wait they send you to jail for that bomb wait wait wait the guy who invented Kwanzaa I did not know this the guy who invented Kwanzaa was sent to prison for torturing women with a solder iron that's right he I actually shocking thing is he's a african-american studies so do they have like a little crush with like a solder iron nearly deep deeply enough into those traditions some wonders so is this I mean is this something that happens from time to time or they do people wage war on Christmas is a big deal like you said it's a very very powerful thing it has it has some pagan roots which I approve of by the way I think I think Christians should take over good festivals and make them Christian festival I think that's a terrific thing but but but people I mean the Protestants have always been a little bit wary of Christmas as opposed to Catholics but what about like real war on Christmas stuff that's right I mean the first one Christmas was even our ancestors the Puritans right who thought it Christmas was too too much potpourri and too much fun who was at HL Mencken said that Puritanism is the fear the haunting fear that's somewhere somebody is happy yeah but yeah that you know I sort of see the reasons for that war on Christmas as they want to make it more Christian but there have been four major groups in modern history that have waged a war against Christmas to make it less Christian or make it non and non-existent these are people who've tried to either ban Christmas or subvert all of its tradition I'll say four groups the French revolutionaries the French revolutionary terrorists the Soviet communists Nazis and Democrats it sounds about right it's all that's alright well yeah you know listen keep your head down I don't want you to get shot in the crossfire in the war on Christmas I'll keep my head down and your head down I mean I keep my head in my little head down thanks Michael goals are global whatever it what is it a
