thank you very much indeed and thank you to everybody that's joining us for this webinar from Sharia Crimestoppers org we're very grateful that you've joined us this evening and that so many of you when over 300 people are joining us my name is Katie Hopkins I'm a British journalist Sean Hannity calls me the gobby one which I think's a little bit rude actually because I do talk quite a lot but the reason I'm here in Michigan and the reason I'm talking to you on this webinar kindly hosted by at the United West org is because I wanted to come to you with a warning and my warning to you as Americans and as many other people joining us across actually the whole of the globe is to say do not let yourselves fall as we in the UK have fallen do not let yourselves become what we in the UK have become and and I should say very clearly that I love my country you know I'm a true patriot I joined the military straight from the University I had a 35-year regular Commission that I had to leave early but for the Intelligence Corps so I have that as my heritage I'm not here to talk my country down I'm super proud of all the things about the country that I love but it has become very clear that we have become a fallen nation and over the next hour I'd like to share with you my experiences in the UK so in the first 15 minutes that you're with me for this hour I'd like to share with you my thoughts really on the State of Britain and no-go Europe so I spend a lot of time on the road traveling no-go zones the places I'm not supposed to go and I would like to share some of my learnings with you in case it's helpful for you in the second 15 minutes so from 7 15 ish seeing how we go I would like to talk to you about how the state supports the managed decline of the UK and Europe manage decline is an inch reading idea I know but for us certainly our state or establishment is very comfortable managing the decline of our countries and from 7:30 until 7:45 in that third section and what I would like to do is update from here in Michigan I've been here for the last few days I've been in Dearborn and I've been in the east side some of the tougher areas of Detroit and I've spent some time in the housing here that's not been at all looked after some of the burnt-out shells the streets where houses are falling down right opposite other people with homes and some of my learnings there particularly with regards to the mosque I was inside the largest mosque in America here in Dearborn and I would like to share my learnings with you and also having met the lovely senator Patrick Colbeck some of my concerns about the way he's being positioned and in that final 15 minutes if you're hang on in there with me I'd be grateful and we will have a Q&A session and I will get to as many questions as I can and do feel free to ask me anything and one of the lucky things about me being a older be British and and see I've got the skin of a rhino some say is that you can ask me anything and I am impossible to offend although you might be able to change that this evening someone might be off to offend me but on the bottom of your screens you should be able to see a Q&A button so if you want to click on that log your questions you can ask questions all the way through in that last 15 minutes I will get to as many of your questions as I can so please do ask anything you would like to ask so right now I will press on with the first part of my webinar presentation to you if I may um each of my sections that we're going to talk about comes with a clip that I'd really like to share with you and the purpose of these clips are there from my journeys around this crazy world of ours and I think they help to kind of give some kind of context to the sorts of things I'm hoping to share maybe just two minutes about myself if that's helpful if I'm a stranger to you on your screens I'm here in a hotel room just outside Dearborn in Detroit I'm here I've got a camera team a team of two kindly provided to me by my employer rebel media there are conservative news outlet in Canada and surprisingly Canada still have some conservative voices so much of the footage I'm going to share with you and the footage I'll be posting on Hopkins worldcom over the next few days and that comes courtesy of the brilliant team at rebel media and I do commend them to you I am just a mom of three kids in the real world and my children are 14 13 and 9 girl girl boy and really my hearts and the reason I fight now in the way that I do the reason I do these journeys to some of the more difficult places on the planet where we are beaten up or attacked or routinely come under some kind of duress because of the stories were trying to tell the reason I'm doing that actually is because of my daughters and my son but for my children I would really like it if they could grow up in the country that I used to know and the country that my granddad fought for and that's really the reason I do what I do now and carry on my fight which started in the military ins now more in the media is to try and help other people see the threats that I see coming to the United States so first up if I may I would like to talk about the State of Britain so in that word the state of Britain I mean the state of disrepair that we've fallen into in the UK and then extend that a little to other no-go zones that I've travelled and reported from extensively over the last sort of five or six years many of you will know that the UK is in quite a state at the moment we have the highest murder rate that we've ever had for decades and in fact recently our murder rate overtook that of New York that's unheard of in London which I like to call London is down because it's now a city I barely recognize anymore I certainly don't see people that represent a Britain I used to know many of the areas around London if you imagine London as a clock face with a clock dial around it some of the areas say from nought to five five to ten if not to five is Tower Hamlets a particular area of London that's almost ninety five percent Muslim and in the next area UUM I think that's about 80 cent eighty six percent Muslim so what I'm trying to allude to here is that there is a very high density population of Muslims in London and in the areas in the voting areas of London and of course that's not problematic in itself none of us have got anything against a particular religion or a particular population I don't mind who comes to my country if they want to work hard and play fair and contribute but of course what we were sold in the UK as with much of Western Europe we were sold an ideal we were sold an ideal of multiculturalism of diversity we were told that diversity is our strength and of course we haven't seen that at all what we've ended up with is a series of mono cultures and in London the mono culture is the Muslim culture and it is a very pervasive culture indeed and what it means of course is that our London Mayor Sadiq Khan has a guaranteed voting bloc in London he won I believe by four hundred thousand votes and that dense population which increases in density each year and votes according in my view to religion by religious lines as opposed to by may be democratic lines in the sense of policy that is something that I am afraid of and what we've seen in the UK is that template for achieving power repeated throughout the UK so the majority of mar√©s in the UK ma y ou RS if my accent is confusing I know that were sounds strange when I said mez the majority of Mayors in the UK are Muslim and they have what would you say worked out that once you become a mayor in the UK you have access to policing you have access to the budgets that control how the city is made up you control what is spent where and of course you have the ability to favor a population that will then vote for you so if I give an example a concrete example in the UK we have Muslim only housing that is supported by the London Mayor people like myself were right to live in London exclusively would be excluded from applying for that housing I mean they make a notional idea that I could apply but of course the board that permits people to apply for housing in London in the Muslim housing is all Muslim men so in that way what you can do if you're the mayor is you can get additional housing you can fill it with more people who are going to vote for you and of course their gratitude to you means that you are bound to secure their votes and you might say so what why do I care why does this matter in America but if I give the example here in Michigan where you start to see people voting according to perhaps their religion as opposed to policy or pragmatic ideals for what might make America better I think that's a concern and what we've seen in the UK of course is that once one is enabled and establishes power and a process for achieving that power and the process for achieving budgets that enables spending which then attracts votes you will see that template repeated over and over and over in the United States of America just as we've seen that in the UK and if I can give an example from a more emotional context of what that means I get emails all the time my email if you want is Katie at Katie Hopkins Cote UK I try and meet my own emails and my husband lovely Marc helps me I'm to make sure that nobody is ignored but I get females from elderly men and women and they say that they are glad that their time in the UK is nearly up because they do not want to live to see their country fall and those are very hard emails for someone like me to respond to as a regular mum and interesting actually I get a lot of emails my radio show was actually the biggest biggest loud audience I had was young people 16 and 17 year olds and it seems like these two ends of the axis we have people who despair because they no longer have a voice because the young people feel they don't they can no longer say what they feel because they're kind of held back because they're supposed to buy into all of the liberal ideology that they are spoon-fed and certainly in our schools there is one way of thought that is allowed in my children's state schools there were two trips to the mosque in one term alone and Christmas was canceled we have to talk about a winter festival instead needless to say my children were removed from that school what I think we see a lot of as well of course is the censorship of conservative voices like my own I was due to be on a radio station actually in Detroit this week but was removed with five minutes notice because I believe they received a call from someone on the outside to say no her views are not acceptable and this silencing is something we see a lot and the silencing happens in a number of ways sometimes with threats and intimidation 2g Hardys threatened to chop off my head in 2017 and there was a plot to behead me by 2g Hardee's unfortunately that plot was foiled and fortunately that plot those 2g Hardys were sent to prison but those are the threats that we face and what I'd like to do now as something that's indicative of the silencing that we face is I would like to share with you a clip this was at the free speech event held in Hyde Park and at this free speech event I was undercover I wasn't showing my face I had a big hood on had a big scarf on I just went there to show boots on the ground because there were a couple of journalists you may know their names Lauren southern and Brittany Pettibone they were prevented from entering the UK on the basis of future hate speech as yet unset I just repeat that they were prevented from coming to the UK on the basis of future hate speech as yet unset and in kind of protest against this I went to Hyde Park I went undercover but I saw a gentleman being attacked by a mob so I got involved so what I'd like to do now if I may is play you a clip that I have it's a very brief clip of me at Hyde Park trying to defend a gentleman who was being attacked by the mob and indeed stand up for Britain and our right to have the country that so many elderly people feel that they are going to lose so we're going to play that clip for you now if we may thank you very much for watching that clip so you know you'll sort see this sort of stress points were under when you're surrounded like that but it's really important I think for someone like me to keep speaking out and and you'll know from the silencing that happens that the more of us that still have that voice we continue to sort of speak for others perhaps or at least represent others even if we don't necessarily say precisely what they think who don't really have an ability to speak out anymore now in this next section I wanted to address with you how politicians and the state supports managed decline and what I mean by that principle is this idea we imagine somehow that our politicians are fighting for us that they're fighting for a better country that they have our best interests at heart that all the promises they make to us on the campaign trail is somehow going to come true or that they're always going to stand up for what might be best for our country and so many people ask me how is it the case that actually Europe has been allowed to fall or that London is stand is able to have a murder rate higher than New York or that we continue to have open borders where so many people can flood through into our country and what I have to explain is sadly the state our government our politicians and the establishment make as much money find it just as profitable and as politically lucrative in terms of winning votes to steadily manage the decline of our country as they do to try and push it forward and I would say that's the opposite of what Donald Trump is trying to do here in America Donald Trump stands there on a platform of making America great again and sadly in the UK we don't have anybody saying that message we only have leaders prepared to bend down and be submissive to a culture that seems determined to take over the place that they chose to join if I give a few concrete examples in many areas in the UK and I have received emails direct from police officers serving police officers about this police officers say that Imams in the mosques in certain areas where Sharia is the predominant and accepted policing in the UK the Imams are selecting the police officers allowed to patrol in those areas and I think if you think about the way that the establishment then are linked with the police force which are linked with the mosques you start to see how Islam can truly take a stronghold in a country like mine we also have new laws in place they've just been introduced and those laws for someone like me I'm six years inside six years in prison for someone like me who has a relatively large social media following if I say anything that's considered to be hateful against the religion of Islam now of course I'm not out here to say anything hateful it's not my message to say anything that involves hate but if someone perceives that my Truths should be hateful they can report those to the police and the police can prosecute me and the threat is that I can spend anything up to six years inside and I have been of course challenged by the police on a number of occasions I was interviewed by the major crime and homicide command for a 500-word article in a national newspaper that had already gone through our editorial and legal team and for example in another a way that we're sensitive voices Fox News that's been taken off the air in the UK it's not seen as appropriate for UK audiences and I think my American friends tend to find that a little hard to believe and also our state broadcaster the BBC you know we had this idea many people did that they kind of looked up to the BBC that it was this kind of vast Univ of reporting truths and I don't see it that way anymore you know our state broadcaster has a specific agenda so with the Royal Wedding that I'm sure many of you have been watching today a couple weeks ago the state broadcaster asked for and less gay and transsexual couples that were getting married on the same day as Megan maar Khan and Prince Harry to come forward and share their stories I have no problem with that but that's the sort of agenda the BBC has it's always about the breakdown of the traditional family unit and rather trying to promote something of the other something that rips apart the fabric of the society that we think is important and then makes us dependent on perhaps a religion or more likely the state and the other curious thing about the UK when you think about the fact that we turned away journalists at our border Canadian and American journalists at our border on the basis of future hate speech as yet unsaid is that of course we welcome back returning jihadists to the UK with open arms somehow they're called victims somehow if you went and fought for Syria you're a victim in the UK and you should be embraced and welcomed back in fact we almost went as far as bribing these individuals with housing and schools 462 jihadis we welcomed back into the heart of Britain and then we wonder why our children are terrorized and why we end up with no-go zones in the heart of cities that were once civilized I recently traveled to molenbeek in Belgium now many of you will think of Brussels and Belgium and you will think of the EU maybe of men in suits of people you know this kind of administrative powerhouse of the EU the place that I went to is called the jihadi capital of Europe and basically if there's ever been jihadi activity it happens there that is the heartland of jihadi terror and in molenbeek when I was there I was walking around investigating I wanted to find out some of the truth of this place that so many are fearful of going to it's only about a four mile squared area it's a really small area six kilometers squared so very small but in that one area in that six kilometer squared area there are 22 mosques there are only five official mosques and the rest are unofficial mosques and what they mean by unofficial mosques there kind of people's Langa's or living rooms rooms probably just like this that are must and what it means by unofficial it means they're not policed they're not regulated there is no sense of who the Imam is who might be preaching there and so what is being preached there and the sort of teachings that are happened there those aren't known either and that's going on right now in the center of Belgium in fact the biggest mosque it's called the Great Mosque the Grand Mosque of Belgium that was given to the Saudis on a 99-year rent-free lease it was given to them for free on the basis that there would be cheaper foreign oil in return so you can always see already see whether the money is coming from that's being channeled back into the politicians that enable this to happen that enable the manage decline that we talked about and so this mosque because it was given to the Saudis rent-free they were able to bring in whichever Imam they wanted and so they brought in an extremist Imam from Egypt who was preaching the most violent form of Islam that there is politicians some of the the decent conservative politicians in Belgium tried to deport that Imam but that was overturned and so what I'm trying to paint for you is this picture where not only do we hand over of the borders of our countries and allow a complete overthrow of one population by another but we also then allow those in who will teach an extremist form of Islamic belief a fundamental form of Islamic belief and then we wonder why we end up with jihadis in our midst it's absolutely no surprise to me and as part of my time in molenbeek investigating the no-go zones where other people refused to tread I bumped in to the mayor which was not her best day on record I think slightly unfortunate for her and she was the mayor and she and to my mind she has completely turned a blind eye to all of the things that are happening in the small area that she's responsible for she is responsible for the safety and security of the people in that town and yet she has presided over a period where it's been known as the jihadi capital of Europe and interestingly or perhaps not interestingly but more in a more sinister way in October 2015 she was given a list of suspected jihadist known to have purchased equipment for use in the making of bombs she was given a list of jihadis suspected of engaging in terrorist activities and she was alerted to the imminent threat she was given that list and yet she did nothing and one month later from molenbeek Salaam Abdul Salah went out into Paris and coordinated the Paris attacks you may well remember the Paris attacks of November 2015 in which a hundred and thirty people died and a further four hundred or so were maimed that was the night that the battered clan attack happened you'll remember there was a concert and men stormed that building with automatic weapons which you'll recall we don't have the right to guns in Europe but yet still we're attacked with automatic weapons she was given the name of that man a month before and she did nothing and when I said to her you did nothing she said it was not my job and my concern my concern for America and my concern for places where Muslims will get into power it's nothing to do with the religion it's the fact that politicians are willing to turn a blind eye and create these blind spots in our countries they say blind spots like it's a harmless thing we have this ability to use words that make things sounds harmless don't we we use the word grooming gangs for rape squads as if they're going to somehow do some kind of grooming and make people look better and do their hair you know these blind spots are actually places where terrorists are able to establish and make plans and worse than that the terrorists are responsible for the Paris attacks also went back to molenbeek and was hidden by the people of molenbeek for a further four months before he was found by the police it was one of the largest manhunts in history what I'd like to do now if I may is share with you a clip from my time in Manan beak and this and that the person that I'm introducing you to here is the mayor of molenbeek who told me that to police the problem was not her job if we could play that clip now I'd be very grateful but were you told that Salah abdel-salam was a suspected terrorist in Mali but were you given that list were you given that information in October 2016 15 yes well we had a list but this list was known it was not the job of the local police to follow those people this is the job of the federal police and still now is the job but if a hundred and thirty people died on 415 people were injured if that was my daughter and you said but it wasn't our job I would really want to I would feel angry at you wouldn't know many people would still angry every day so that was me I wouldn't say accosting because she did come over to me actually and she saw me not to sit on the filthy seats which I suppose best the question why she doesn't clean the seats up in her town either but so hear her say it was not my job I actually found it very emotional and was was very upset straight after because as a mum again I go back to that as my source of reference every time as a mum if that was my daughter and that's how I always see all of these attacks if that was my daughter imagine a woman looking at me and saying it was not my job and then saying well it was okay they weren't terrorists they were Joe Hardy's it was not my job and and my point about this clip further the so what so what always ask yourself so what we can be shown a lot of clips these days so what the so what is she turned a blind eye I would say because she was prepared to sacrifice the safety of our daughters in order to secure the Muslim vote and interestingly and probably not interesting actually probably much more it's much more sad there's a competition you know for the best mayor in the world the best mayor in the world and guess whose name is up for best mayor in the world that mayor there that told me it's not her job to do anything about the jihadis that live right next door to her because she has more interest in securing the voting block and and I guess the message for America is you see how this is circular if you allow someone to come in who needs the Muslim voting bloc to secure that position what you will see is a turning of a blind eye to certain things and worse still a failure to act when people's safety is at risk and that's really the thing I want to highlight with you and the reason I travel to these no-go zones because it doesn't matter what they call me they call me the same things they call you they call me a Islamophobe they call me a bigot they call me a racist they call me a xenophobe I'm none of those things I went to South Africa to understand why black and white farmworkers are attacked when farmworkers are attacked I don't see color but when they apply labels to me the best way we have a fighting back very often is to show our truths so just a reminder for people joining us right now there's a link that you've received on your email when you signed up if you want to share that with your friends you can push that link out right now they

bottom of your screen there's a Q&A box if you click on that Q&A you can put your questions in I'm impossible to offend ask me anything you want about the UK the fall of the UK no-go zones and what it means for America or even challenge what I think if you disagree with stuff I've said please say you know I would always say for us for so many of us the one thing we don't want is to have to agree to be able to have a conversation agreement should never have been a precursor to any debates it really frustrates me actually when people say oh well you know I really love you I don't agree with everything you've got to say but I really love you and I always want to say to them I never asked you to I never asked you to agree with anything I said I'm delighted that you're here I'm delighted that we're having a conversation and if you told me you hated everything that came out of my mouth but at least we were here chatting that suits me perfectly fine I think it's when we're shutting down the conversation I think that's where I see a concern and I think the fact that we see the silencing of conservative conservative voices excuse me is something that concerns me greatly as well now in this next section if I may having spoken to you about the state of britain in terms of the decline of britain having spoken to you about the managed decline in the way that our police and our establishment and our state broadcaster is complicit in the decline of our country given the example of the mayor there of molenbeek in belgium and of course sweden is set in exactly that same way of you know there on that same trajectory sweden really is a fallen country i've spent some time in the know goes there no-go zones there rinkeby and i have to say those are some of the most violent territories that i've had the displeasure of being part of what i want to do in this next quarter for now if I may is talk to you a little bit about my observations here in Michigan and Detroit I apologize if if you find them to be unfair I I would say that I have only been here for three or four days so so I accept that I am very much an outsider but with my experiences from Western Europe I just wanted to share some of my observations that I found here on the ground I'm looking at your race for governor you know I think there are alarm bells that ring for me I do have concerns and I believe I say these in a non-partisan way clearly you know I'll call my hand I'm a massive Trump supporter I'm a massive brexit here people call me the female Faraj for a reason or the British ankles but I'm a massive Trump supporter but my warning for Michigan is that I see you headed your way above us you're in a much better place didn't I'll ever be in the UK being in the UK is like being a cold shower and here so I've being in a warm bath but you are headed on the trajectory then I am alway already a very long way down and I don't wish it upon anybody not anybody not my enemies and so I say here in Michigan the race for governor I think is going to take on global significance I have seen that the Muslim Democratic candidate as I believe he will be let's see what happens in the primary but I believe looking at the forces that are aligning at a deep level in the establishment I believe whatever happens he will be the Democratic candidate and I'm I will stand here sit here and apologize if I've called that wrong but if I look at the way the forces are aligning and with my experience he will be the candidate and what I would say about Abdul Elsayed is I see the same things happening here that I've seen happen over and over and over in the UK first up financing wherever you see power and the concentration of power particularly in the hands of the mosques there is a great deal of finance I was inside your biggest mosque in Dearborn the Islamic center of America I believe it's called 3,000 people can fit in there the minarets as you know a ten stories tour I was inside the mosque I'll be bringing you a report from inside the mosque that will be hosted at Hopkins worldcom we'll make sure we share it here with you but my two observations inside of that mosque one was the wall the the sort of wall of fame the Hall of Fame if you will images of the Imam historically with Carter images of the Imam with George W Bush images of the Imam with Muhammad Ali a kind of celebrity wall of fame if you will and political wall of fame reminding people of the power of the mosque in Dearborn and the power of the Muslim community the second thing I noticed was a room where donors and big donors were flagged up on the wall a framed prints of donors and how much they've given and there were big numbers on those inside those frames and what I noticed when I take that as a kind of template for the gubernatorial race here in Michigan is the amount of donations that are coming in for Abdullah Al Fayed from outside of your state and that concerns me greatly because once donations start coming in from outside I'm reminded I'm reminded of that mosque in Belgium which was given to the Saudis for funds to flow through in order for them to install the Imam that they were in order to preach a very extremist form of Islam and to carry on changing the nature of the country to a Muslim country and be aware in Belgium the Islam party is formalized and established it has two candidates already elected and we'll be posting 28 candidates in the next election that's the Islam Party and their policies are segregation on buses halal foods and covered women that is in Belgium right now so what I'm trying to say to you on this trajectory is I see them money flowing to Abdullah El Sayed from outside of Michigan State and I see Linda South Sora pushing money towards the campaign and I see him escalating his campaign not to be about Michigan his campaign is now escalated to be against Trump so if you dislike Trump vote for me and and we're at what point to the regular families of Michigan that I spent time with yesterday in some of the very rundown areas facing homes that are burnt out and destroyed where do their voices get heard in that when you start talking about making this against Trump when you have 42% of your funds coming in from outside the state when you have the mosque backing you that Imams telling you that it's all ours will that you back Abdul El Sayed when he starts telling other gubernatorial candidates that they are hated by the Muslims at what point does the lady I spoke to an African American lady in Detroit living opposite a burnt-out shell of a house with her little son Demetrius where did they get a voice where do their concerns about the road that they can't even drive down because it's in such a state of disrepair where do they get a voice and she can't rebuild her fence because the grass is too long because the state hasn't come to cut her grass because it can't afford it when they get a voice and where does she she wants to start a petition to try and get the house opposite her at least knocked down because she's scared for her child because of the glass and the the state of disrepair of the place I clambered amongst those houses we'll bring you those reports - where does she get her voice when abdullah al Saleh Syed is making this about a vote against Trump and that's what makes me so upset is for mothers and their children here in Michigan who deserve better and you know I was fortunate enough to spend time with Patrick Colbeck and to me it doesn't matter which candidate you vote for I'm not questioning your loyalties at all but my observation having spent time with Patrick he's a very regular guy he's very I mean he's a lot more intelligent than I am I'll point that out for sure yeah but he's a very regular guy he's very like me or you or the next guy he's had a regular job he told me he didn't even want to be a politician in fact it's his least favorite job of all time and that fills me with great hope because you know what he didn't even want to be in the gubernatorial race but he feels it's his job he feels it's his duty and I really identify with that it's probably the same reason I'm here rabbiting on it you poor souls I feel it's my duty to stand up for what's right and what I notice about both Patrick and myself and I'm sure other candidates would want to share with this but particularly with Patrick having spoken to him and met him in person and I commend you I recommend you to do the same it's always great to speak to people in person to understand them the media say I'm a complete monster and I'm pretty sure I'm not but meeting him in person what I see is a man who's prepared to stand up and defend people like me women the rights of women to be uncovered you know even to go inside that mosque I had to put a scarf on my head and inside that mosque I was told I needed to sit at the back of the room because if I was to be in front of men I might distract them in their prayer and that's a terribly sad thing for me I mean I don't see myself as a sexual object I'm sure none of you do either but I would be a very hard it would be a big ass but what I'm trying to say is at no point do any of us women see ourselves as sexual objects first we have a lot more to offer but that's how Muslim people seem to see us certainly that's the messaging I got from the mosque and certainly I would like to say that Patrick is somebody who is standing up for women and and your daughters and people like me who just want the red you'll have things in life I don't see him as on the attack at all I see him rather as a defender and I think what we all need to rally around is somebody that's speaking up for your state you know better I don't know your state but I do see the rundown houses I do see the roads that need mending I do see that you have real engineering issues that could do with a pragmatic policymaker who knows about process and I see that in Patrick maybe you can see it in someone else but I do have a real fear for you if you go down the line of taking on somebody who's achieving finances from outside of your state and whose ambition seems to be very interconnected with the mosque and his faith if he prays 34 times a day one wonders how much time has he got for the lovely family I met the african-american family I met who simply wants someone to come and mow their grass and sometimes I think we need to get away from this kind of news cycle the media agenda whatever we're being told by CNN or Fox or whatever the newspaper you read I don't mind or care I sometimes think we just need to go and talk to some regular people and ask them what was the one big worry they've got and this lady she worries about her son and his safety so if I may just before we go into the question and answer session do keep your questions coming I'm the question-and-answer session via the next two minutes or so I just like to play you a clip that I had we shot it at the just outside the mosque before I went in a couple days ago um and just my observations I think about the key themes that I believe are impacting on Michigan and my real concerns for you when the Democratic candidate of choice gubernatorial candidate does turn out to be Abdullah Al Fayed and when he does turn out to have one of the richest campaigns ever seen in the United States of America I'd like to say that I was here calling out those warning shots and if I may I'd like to share with you this clip from just a couple days ago and we can play that clip now if that's okay I'm here in Michigan and in many ways this place is entirely symbolic of the fight that's ahead the fight between the traditional values or of America of liberty and freedom and then here the largest mosque in America and the rapidly increasing Muslim population that lives right here in Dearborn and finally the old churches this sense of the traditional faith of America and the real question for residents here is will this be the first state in the United States of America that has a Muslim governor I do feel a sense of real foreboding actually and it's absolutely nothing to do with someone's religion it's absolutely absolutely to do with people like me my children my daughters your sons and daughters and the right of of wives to feel that they can go about the place without having to be covered or without being judged for having Western values certainly there's areas I go to in London where if I walk through I would be spat at for not covering my head or my shoulders and not that I go around with my shoulder out but you'll be spat at or you'll be called white trash certainly in Sweden and in the jungle at Calais where I spent some time with the migrants there I was physically attacked for not having my head or my shoulders covered and I suppose if you think that that's what's being taught right now when I was told it just two days ago in the mosque that very quickly translates in communities into stuff that they enact themselves and I and I don't think that's what Michigan wants for its people we are a hundred percent viewer-supported if you can
