this is the largest forest reserve in an urban area in the world Maryborough in the state of Sao Paulo is where an lav Lopez son Anderson died of yellow fever a few weeks ago my oldest son is devastated they were together all the time he is not even coming to our place because he's suffering a lot he was planning to raise his kids he left us here Anderson did not want to get vaccinated Ana later says he started having headaches and then his complexion turned yellow the doctors didn't know what the problem was until after he died Brazil is fighting a yellow fever outbreak that has already claimed dozens of lives at least 14 of them here in Mariposa a massive campaigns now been launched to vaccinate people living in high-risk areas against what's considered to be the worst outbreak of the disease since the 1940s Graciela Bertolini says yellow fever was four years endemic in only certain areas of Brazil but things have changed a few environmental studies noted impacts and forests for the mosquitoes predators such as frogs and dragonflies were extinct the mosquitoes then managed to migrate dispersed Brazil and it's not now just in remote areas but also in Brazil's major cities this is the sao paulo zoo and it's been temporarily shut down because authorities found one dead monkey that's not from the zoo but lived in the surrounding area infected with yellow fever this means that the virus is already here and that's why the government has stepped up efforts to vaccinate people living in the area hundreds of other monkeys have already died across brazil in the last year as the virus has spread but in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro there are not enough vaccines for everyone Ava gene could not protect her family say the aunt it was really busy when I arrived people were queuing for five hours and they told us it was over no more vaccines I have to come next week in Mariposa the other members of Anderson's family have been inoculated yellow fever has already left this family shattered the government's priority is to prevent the virus from causing even more deaths terasawa al-jazeera Maryborough Brazil
