Here's some amazing news: A new study found
that after more than 35 million bike share

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:13,550
trips in the United States, nobody's died.
Regular bike rides are much riskier: 21 of

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,800
every 100 million trips are fatal.
Bikeshares are an increasingly popular way

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,130
of getting around: systems have popped up
in dozens of cities in the past decade.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,449
And fewer people get injured on bike shares
too – In DC, the collision rates are 35%

6
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,290
lower than for regular bikes
So why would bike shares be safer? A few reasons.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,420
First, they tend to be designed with safety
in mind. So this was is a lot heavier, with

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,940
a low center of gravity. This one is a lot
lighter. This one has really wide tires, this

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,640
one has thin tires.
Which makes it hard to go very fast.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,920
And that means you’re less likely to topple
over when you hit a bump or a pothole.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,430
Plus, the bike’s bright colors, flashing
lights and upright seating make riders easier

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,270
to see.
The second reason is about where bike shares

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,950
are.
Bike share stations are mostly located in

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,500
dense, urban areas with lots of foot traffic.
And drivers tend to be going more slowly.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,909
They’re already on the lookout for pedestrians
So cyclists are safer.

16
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:10,819
And third, people who use bike share tend
not to be very experienced cyclists.

17
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:15,950
And weirdly enough, this can be a good thing,
because it means they’re more cautious riders.

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,619
People are less likely to wear helmets. Now,
that might make you think, oh, they're more

19
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:26,340
dangerous. But it actually could be the opposite.
One study found that passing drivers stayed

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,460
further away from cyclists who didn't have
a helmet.

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,049
But if you do get in a crash, wearing a helmet
significantly lowers your odds of a head injury.

22
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,600
So if you have a helmet, it's a really good
idea to wear one. But, if you don't, your

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,840
mom's not watching, and the odds, well, they
are  in your favor

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,800
So, there has been one death in Mexico and two in Canada

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
But, as the study notes, the injury rates there are way

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:00:00,000
lower for bike shares than for regular bike riding
