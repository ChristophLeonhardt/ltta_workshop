2
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:04,681

ANNOUNCING THE ADMINISTRATION'S

9
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:14,491
POLICY TOWARDS IRAN.

10

ECONOMIC ISOLATION AND

11
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:15,492
SANCTIONS.

12
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:16,126
THE SECRETARY OUTLINING A

13
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:18,895
SO-CALLED PRESSURE CAMPAIGN TO

14
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:19,763
WEAKEN IRAN'S ECONOMY UNTIL IT

15
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:23,500
CHANGES ITS BEHAVIOR.

16
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,734
>> THE STING OF SANCTIONS WILL

17
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,236
BE PAINFUL IF THE REGIME DOES

18
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,837
NOT CHANGE ITS COURSE FROM THE

19
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:31,074
UNACCEPTABLE AND UNPRODUCTIVE

20
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,042
PATH THAT IT HAS CHOSEN TO ONE

21
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,177
THAT REJOINS THE LEAGUE OF

22
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:34,511
NATIONS.

23
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:37,480
THESE WILL AND INDEED END UP

24
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,882
BEING THE STRONGEST SANCTIONS IN

25
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:41,084
HISTORY WHEN WE ARE COMPLETE.

26
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,652
>> Mike: POMPEO PROMISES THE

27
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:44,120
U.S. WILL ALSO CONFRONT IRAN

28
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,288
BEYOND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.

29
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:46,223
HE SAID HE WILL WORK WITH THE

00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,291
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO TRACK

31
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,292
DOWN IRANIAN OPERATIVES AROUND

32
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,994
THE WORLD AND IN HIS WORDS,

33
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:52,796
CRUSH THEM.

34
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,899
IRAN IS DISMISSING THE THREATS

35
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,267
TONIGHT.

36
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,336
THE SOUTH KOREANS REPORTEDLY

00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:00,036
SINGLED OUT NATIONAL SECURITY

ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON'S RECENT

00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:04,474
LIBYA MODEL COMMENTS FOR WHY

40
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,342
PYONGYANG IS SUDDENLY HEDGING ON

41
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:06,843
THE SUMMIT.

42
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:08,645
THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO REPORTEDLY

43
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:09,446
ASKING ADVISORS IF YOU SHOULD GO

44
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:12,482
AHEAD WITH THE MEETING.

45
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:14,117
HE WILL HEAR FROM SOUTH KOREAN

JOINING ME NOW FOR ANALYSIS IS

FOR DEFENSE FOR INTELLIGENCE AND

00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:21,191
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE

FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL,

52
00:01:23,893 --> 00:01:24,628
LIEUTENANT GENERAL JERRY BOURQUE

53
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:24,928
ENDS.

54
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:27,063
GREAT TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU.

55
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:29,366
>> THANK YOU, GOOD TO BE WITH

56
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:29,866
YOU.

57
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:32,135
>> Mike: A VERY FIRM SPEECH IN

58
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,170
TERMS OF IRAN POLICY.

59
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,505
YOUR REACTION TO HIS WORDS AND

60
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,140
HIS ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THEIR?

61
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,678
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE SPOKE TO

62
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,512
THEM IN A LANGUAGE THEY

63
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:44,481
UNDERSTAND, THE LANGUAGE OF

64
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:44,848
STRENGTH.

65
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:47,250
I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER

66
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,455
DIPLOMATIC SPEECHES I'VE HEARD

67
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:54,491
CERTAINLY IN THE LAST 30 YEARS.

68
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:55,659
THAT SAID, I THINK HE GOT THEIR

69
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,460
ATTENTION ON THIS AND I THINK

70
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,928
YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE

71
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:01,698
LINE HAS BEEN DRAWN IN THE SAND.

72
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:02,499
NO MORE.

73
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:03,600
HE'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE WHAT

74
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,167
YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

75
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:08,038
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE

76
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:08,872
CAPTURING OUR BOATS OFF YOUR

77
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:09,673
COAST.

78
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,074
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE

79
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:12,309
CALLING FOR THE DEATH OF ISRAEL.

80
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,109
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE

81
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:15,879
TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO

82
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,646
DESTROY AMERICA AND I THINK THAT

83
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,282
THEY GOT THE MESSAGE FROM THAT.

84
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:21,284
>> Mike: NO SURPRISE THE

85
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:21,918
IRANIAN PRESIDENT WAS NOT

86
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:22,619
THRILLED WITH WHAT HE HEARD.

87
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:26,990
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIS

88
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:33,997
COMMENTS.

89
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:34,664
"COUNTRIES ARE INDEPENDENT.

90
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:35,365
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PATH WITH

91
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:35,999
THE SUPPORT OF OUR NATION.

92
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:36,700
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE FOR IRAN

93
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,133
AND THE WORLD?

94
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:37,701
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT?

95
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:38,468
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE SAYS WITH

96
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:40,303
THE SUPPORT OF OUR NATION.

97
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:41,438
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES

98
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:42,539
A LITTLE PONDERING HERE BECAUSE

99
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,875
HE'S ALREADY HAD THREE UPRISINGS

100
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,676
INSIDE IRAN.

101
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,712
ONE AND 2009, THE GREEN

102
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:51,548
REVOLUTION, ONE OF 2,015 AND ONE

103
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:53,416
IN 2017 THAT ROLLED OVER INTO

104
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:53,717
2018.

105
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,085
ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN

106
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:57,187
IRAN OUR PERSIANS.

107
00:02:57,187 --> 00:03:00,323
THE OTHER HALF ARE A MIXTURE.

108
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,057
IT'S AN ECLECTIC GROUP THERE AND

109
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:04,594
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT

110
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:04,994
THEM THERE.

111
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,496
AND BY THE WAY, THEY ARE

112
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:09,265
ACTUALLY FAIRLY PRO-WESTERN.

113
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:10,066
HE'S GOT A PROBLEM.

114
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,769
>> Mike: IS THERE HOPE OF A

115
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:13,837
THOUGH THE EUROPEANS ARE TRYING

116
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:15,905
TO HOLD ONTO THE OLD ONE?

117
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:16,673
>> I THINK THAT THEY MADE VERY

118
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:18,007
CLEAR THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

119
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:21,311
GO BACK AND TRY TO FIX WHAT WE

120
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,711
HAVE.

121
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:23,179
I THINK IT'S A START OVER, START

122
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,281
FROM SCRATCH.

123
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,717
THE KEY TO THAT IS NOT JUST

124
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:28,885
IRAN, BUT IT'S THE EUROPEANS.

125
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,120
UNDER THE EUROPEANS GOING TO GO

126
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,488
AHEAD AND DO WHAT MAKES SENSE?

127
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:33,056
ARE THEY GOING TO FOLLOW

128
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:33,790
DONALD TRUMP'S LEAD AND ARE THEY

129
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,061
GOING TO REALIZE THAT TRUMP WAS

130
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:39,996
RIGHT, THAT TRUMP HAS TAKEN A

131
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,264
BOLD STAND ON NOT ALLOWING IRAN

132
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,600
TO GET THESE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

133
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,467
BECAUSE THEY ARE A MENACE TO THE

134
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,568
WHOLE WORLD, OR ARE THEY GOING

135
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:48,138
TO STICK WITH THE EASY WAY, AND

136
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,240
THAT IS TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW

137
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,542
THEIR CORPORATIONS TO INVEST IN

138
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:52,876
IRAN.

139
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,177
>> Mike: TO NORTH KOREA, THE

140
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:57,680
ODDS OF A SUMMIT SEEM TO BE

141
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,681
PERHAPS SLIPPING A BIT.

142
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,083
A SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER IS

143
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,284
ALREADY PLAYING THE BLAME GAME.

144
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,086
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

145
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:04,020
HE SAYING "THERE ARE SEVERAL

146
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,723
LANDMINES ON THE WAY TO THE

147
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:07,757
SUMMIT BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND

148
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:08,525
THE U.S.

149
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,693
ONE OF THOSE LANDMINES JUST

150
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,729
EXPLODED, JOHN BOLTON."

151
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,631
DID BOLTON MISSTEP?

152
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:18,101
>> TO BEGIN WITH, HE HAS BEEN

153
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:18,500
CONSISTENT.

154
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,769
HE HAS BEEN ON THIS NETWORK MANY

155
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,704
TIMES SAYING EXACTLY WHAT HE

156
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:22,439
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THIS OUGHT TO

157
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,508
BE HANDLED.

158
00:04:25,508 --> 00:04:26,142
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT

159
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,645
SURPRISED BY WHAT BOLTON SAID

160
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:28,978
THERE.

161
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,580
I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

162
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,347
CASES WHERE BOLTON TOOK ONE FOR

163
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:32,382
THE TEAM.

164
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,984
THEY THREW THAT OUT TO SEE HOW

165
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,053
IT WAS GOING TO RESONATE AND IT

166
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:38,521
DIDN'T GO THE WAY THEY WANTED SO

167
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,824
I THINK THAT TRUMP SEPARATED

168
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:43,460
HIMSELF FROM THAT BUT I THINK

169
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,294
BOLTON JUST TOOK ONE FOR THE

170
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:46,095
TEAM ON THIS.

171
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:47,096
>> HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT

172
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:50,500
THE SUMMIT ACTUALLY HAPPENS?

173
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,702
>> IT'S A TOSS-UP RIGHT NOW.

174
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:53,636
I'VE BEEN SKEPTICAL FROM THE

175
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:56,873
VERY BEGINNING ABOUT WHETHER KIM

176
00:04:56,873 --> 00:04:58,641
AFTER ALL THE YEARS THAT HIS

177
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:00,310
FATHER INVESTED IN THIS AND HE'S

178
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,377
INVESTED IN THIS THAT WAS

179
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:02,178
ACTUALLY GOING TO COME TO THE

180
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,080
TABLE IN A SERIOUS WAY.

181
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,882
I THINK NOW HE'S GETTING COLD

182
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,250
FEET ABOUT HAVING TO NEGOTIATE

183
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,086
WITH DONALD TRUMP AND QUITE

184
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:10,854
FRANKLY I THINK IT'S 50/50 THAT

185
00:05:10,854 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S GOING TO COME OFF AT ALL.
