GRADUALLY USING EUROPEAN BANKS. SHANNON. Shannon: RICH EDSON AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S HAS THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO OFFER NORTH KOREA SOLID SECURITY GUARANTEES IF IT WANTS TO STRIKE A DEAL. PUTIN SAYS HE HOPES NEXT WEEK'S SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN PRODUCES POSITIVE RESULTS. NEGOTIATIONS AIMED AT MAKING THAT HAPPEN CONTINUE. HERE IS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT GREG PALKOT. AS PREPARATIONS BILL FOR NEXT WEEK'S SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE, INVOLVING WITH GREEN LEADER KIM JONG UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, NEW SIGNS THE REGIME MIGHT BE BACK DOWN FURTHER. SAYING THAT SATELLITE IMAGE. LAST MONTH'S CLAIM DESCRIPTION OF A NUCLEAR TEST SITE. KIM JONG UN GOT BACK ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND BEGGED WHICH IS EXACTLY THE POSITION YOU WANT TO PUT HIM IN. OTHERS WARNED CAUTION. TALKS CONTINUE. STILL TO BE CONFIRMED, HOW COMMITTED THE REGIME IS TO DO NUCLEAR AND HOW DISARMAMENT WOULD BE VERIFIED. IT WILL REQUIRE A LEVEL OF ACCESS AND INTRUSIVENESS OF NORTH KOREA THAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE NEVER ALLOWED. ALSO IMPLY, THE POSSIBILITIES SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN WOULD JOIN TRUMP AND KIM TO DECLARE AN END TO THE KOREAN WAR. MARKING BACKCOUNTRY'S MEMORIAL DAY, MOON HELD OUT HOPE TO FIND LONG-LOST U.S. CASUALTIES. Translator: I WILL PRIORITIZE THE WORK OF DISCOVERING THREE REMAINS BURIED AT THE DMZ, INCLUDING AMERICAN SOLDIERS. IS THE SITE IN SINGAPORE IS READIED, MORE FOLKS ARE GETTING INTO THE ACT. AFTER A VISIT WITH SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, SINGAPORE'S FOREIGN MINISTER GOES TO PYONGYANG THURSDAY. JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER ABE ALSO MEETS PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW. EVEN FORMER BASKETBALL STAR DENNIS RODMAN SAYS HE IS COMING TO SINGAPORE. NO WORD ON WHAT IF ANY ROLE RODMAN MIGHT PLAY. AT LEAST IT SEEMS, A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO ELBOW THEIR WAY
