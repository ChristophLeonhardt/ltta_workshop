“I’m Chris Kennedy.”
“My name is J.B. Pritzker.”
“My name is Jeanne Ives.”
A Kennedy,
a billionaire
and a right-wing conservative
in a very blue state.
These are a few
of the candidates
for governor of Illinois.
They are attempting
to unseat this man.
“I’m Bruce Rauner, governor
of the great state of Illinois.”
Rauner, a Republican, is now
one of the most vulnerable
incumbents facing
election this year.
Here are the main players
and a look at how this race
has been playing out.
This is Democrat J.B. Pritzker.
He’s a billionaire heir
to the Hyatt Hotel fortune
and the current frontrunner.
“J.B. is the one I trust to
fight for women, children
and families all
across Illinois.”
“As Democrats, we need
to come together.
Let’s back the candidate
ready to lead Illinois.
That’s J.B.”
But his campaign took a hit when
racially insensitive comments
he made in 2008 to a wiretapped
politician leaked to the press.
In this audio,
Pritzker is advising
then-Governor
Rod Blagojevich
on who should fill
the U.S. Senate seat
vacated by Barack Obama
after he won the presidency.
“I got a great idea for
you though: Jesse White.
Even though I know
you guys aren't like,
you know, bosom buddies
or anything,
it covers you on the
African-American thing.”
“Correct.”
Pritzker apologized.
“On that call I was not
my best self.
I can be better.
I have been better.
And I can do better.”
The Republican side has also
seen its share of controversy.
That’s candidate Jeanne Ives.
And this is one of her
attack ads on Rauner.
“We want to say thank you.”
“Thank you, Bruce Rauner.”
“Thank you for
signing legislation
that lets me use
the girls’ bathroom.”
“Thank you for making all Illinois
families pay for my abortions.”
Critics called it racist,
sexist and homophobic.
Ives disagreed.
“That’s exactly what typically
a transgender man looks like.”
“No, it’s not.”
“Sir, with all due respect.
Look, I’ve had them
show up at my door.”
Another Democratic
hopeful is Chris Kennedy,
the son of former
Senator Robert Kennedy.
“50 years ago, Chris Kennedy’s
father, Robert F. Kennedy,
launched a campaign
for president
based upon the
principles of peace,
justice and compassion
for those who suffer.”
Kennedy, like Pritzker
and Rauner, is wealthy.
But unlike the others,
Kennedy is part of
a powerful political dynasty.
Then there’s Democrat
Daniel Biss,
a former math professor
with an income of $35,000.
He’s using his lack of
wealth as a weapon,
producing ads that portray
Kennedy and Pritzker
as superrich and
out of touch.
Rauner has become increasingly
unpopular in Illinois —
a typically Democratic state.
Can he hold off his toughest
and richest competition yet?
