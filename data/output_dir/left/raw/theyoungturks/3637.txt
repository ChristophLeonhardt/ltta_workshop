1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,050
ROY MOORE IS THE WORST.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,020
I WILL
SAY THAT, OF COURSE HE

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,240
AFFILIATES HIMSELF WITH OTHER
HELD DEMONS SWAMP ORCS, AND WE

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,900
WILL POINT OUT JUST ONE OF THEM.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,889
TALKING POINTS MEMO REPORTS ON

6
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:16,640
ONE DONOR WHO IS PARTICULARLY
TERRIBLE WHO WAS MAKING NEWS,

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,870
MICHAEL PEROUTKA, THERE HE IS ON
THE RIGHT, ROY MOORE IS ON THE

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,560
LEFT.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,950
ACCORDING TO TALKING
POINTS MEMO --

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:42,410
>>WHO IS MICHAEL ANTHONY
PEROUTKA?

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,430
WELL --

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:01:00,840
>>THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW
CENTER SAY THAT GROUP IS A HATE

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,280
GROUP, PEROUTKA JOKES ABOUT
THAT, HE'S NO LONGER WITH THE

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,420
GROUP, BUT SINCE HE LEFT THEY
ORGANIZED THE CHARLOTTESVILLE

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,850
PROTEST, THEIR LEADER ONCE TO
ORGANIZE A SOUTHERN MILITIA FOR

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,609
GUERRILLA WAR, HE WANTS TO
ATTACK THE ORGANIZED JEWRY,

17
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,869
WHICH I'M A PART OF, WE ARE VERY
ORGANIZED.

18
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:25,869
IS IT ANY SURPRISE

19
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:31,570
THAT ROY MOORE AFFILIATES
HIMSELF WITH THESE FOLKS?

20
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,289
>>ALABAMA.

21
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:39,119
>>I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD, I
DON'T THINK HE KNEW THAT THEY

22
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,500
WERE -- I THINK HE THOUGHT THEY
JUST REALLY CARED ABOUT THEIR

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,039
HERITAGE.

24
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,350
I DON'T SEE A RACIST
BONE IN HIS WHITE BODY.

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,350
DO YOU?

26
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,380
>>NOT AT ALL.

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,679
WHAT ELSE, WE HAVE
SOME GREATEST HITS, YOU WANT TO

28
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:00,679
SEE PEROUTKA IN ACTION?

29
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:02,369
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO SING THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

30
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,889
>>WAS HE IN THE UNITED STATES?

31
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:09,848
>>OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, WE WILL PLAY A VIDEO OF

32
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,470
WHAT HAPPENED.

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:26,650
>>♪ I WISH I WAS IN THE LAND OF
COTTON, OLD TIMES THERE ARE NOT

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:35,050
♪ FORGOTTEN, LOOK AWAY, LOOK
AWAY, LOOK AWAY, DIXIELAND

35
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,200
>>THERE YOU GO.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,400
I CAN'T LOOK
AWAY.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,939
I KIND OF HAD TO BECAUSE

38
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,019
THERE WAS A MAN WHO STOOD UP --

39
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,130
>>WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S
BACK.

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,799
>>I DON'T -- WELL, I DO GET IT,
IT'S CALLED COGNITIVE

41
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,010
DISSONANCE, YOU LEARN HOW TO
PRACTICE THAT IF YOU GROW UP

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,540
RELIGIOUSLY GUIDED.

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,079
THEY ARE
UPSET AT COLIN KAEPERNICK FOR

44
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,409
DOING A SILENT, RESPECTFUL
PROTEST, THEY SAY IT DISRESPECTS

45
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:13,000
THE FLAG AND THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM, THIS GUY IS SINGING A

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,140
TRAITOR'S SONG, THEY HAVE A
CONFEDERATE FLAG THEY WAVE ALL

47
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,370
THE TIME, THIS IS COGNITIVE
DISSONANCE.

48
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,709
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL TO

49
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,310
SHOW YOU WHO THESE PEOPLE REALLY
ARE.

50
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,099
THEY ARE TRAITORS TO

51
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,439
AMERICA.

52
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,970
WHITE SUPREMACISTS ARE
TRAITORS TO AMERICA, JUST LIKE

53
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,900
THAT GUY IS, THAT'S ALL THIS IS
ABOUT, PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAITORS

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,709
TO AMERICA AND THERE'S NO DOUBT.

55
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:42,750
YOU SAY STAND FOR THE NATIONAL

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,719
ANTHEM AND SING A SONG OF A
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO

57
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,140
OVERTHROW OUR GOVERNMENT, WHAT
DO YOU CALL THAT?

58
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
THAT'S LIKE

59
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,140
ISIS.

60
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,939
>>THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WENT
WITH IT BECAUSE THIS ARTICLE

61
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,690
KEPT COMING BACK TO RELIGION AND
HOW THEY WANT TO CHANGE OUR

62
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:02,010
GOVERNMENT TO BE MORE RELIGIOUS,
YOU PUT THE QUOTE UP THERE WHERE

63
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,159
THEY CALLED FOR A SOUTHERN
NATION RUN BY THE ANGLO CELTIC

64
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,439
ELITE, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
ISIS IS TRYING TO DO, THEY ARE

65
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,829
TRYING TO CREATE THEIR OWN
GOVERNMENT THAT IS RELIGIOUS

66
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,470
BASED -- THAT IS WHAT RATE MOORE
IS TRYING TO DO WITH HIS

67
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,100
500,000 BUCKS FROM HIS REALLY
CRAZY FRIEND.

68
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,640
>>YOU GOTTEN $622,000 SINCE
2004, 45,000 FOR HIS TWO

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:36,030
GUBERNATORIAL RUNS, MONEY FOR
MOORE'S SUPREME COURT COME BACK.

70
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:46,350
THIS IS ONE THING THIS GUY SAID
--

71
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,980
>>AND TO JEN'S POINT, HE SAID
--

72
00:04:50,980 --> 00:05:02,330
>>IF A MUSLIM PERSON SAID THAT
HE WOULD CALL FOR HIM TO BE HUNG

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,330
UP --

74
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:20,200
>>MY FAVORITE THING -- ROY
MOORE WAS KICKED OUT OF THE

75
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,240
SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA BECAUSE
HE ERECTED A GIANT 10

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
COMMANDMENTS MONUMENT IN THE
COURTHOUSE, BUT BECAUSE A COURT

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,570
SAID YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT DOWN
BECAUSE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND

78
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,490
STATE, YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT
THERE, AND HE SAID NO.

79
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,490
SO HE GOT

80
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,250
KICKED OUT.

81
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,050
PEROUTKA BUILT A
REPLICA OF THE 10 COMMANDMENTS,

82
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,710
ACCORDING TO TALKING POINTS
MEMO, ON HIS LAND, RENAMED THE

83
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,020
FIELD WHERE HE PUT THAT ROY
MOORE FIELD, HE HAS MADE

84
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,810
ANTIABORTION, ANTI-GAY, AND
CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS --

85
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:05,710
DONATIONS TO THOSE -- AND THEN
PEROUTKA GAVE $1 MILLION TO A

86
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:13,590
FOSSILIZED SKELETON OF
A DINOSAUR.

87
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:20,580
IT LOOKS LIKE A GIANT CROCODILE
DINOSAUR.

88
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,860
>>SO THEY BELIEVE IN DINOSAURS?

89
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,220
I'VE BEEN TO THAT MUSEUM, BY THE

90
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:31,490
WAY, THEY FOLLOW YOU AROUND AND
MAKE SURE YOUR ART LAUGHING OR

91
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,560
POKING FUN IN FRONT OF OTHER
PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT

92
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,610
WE WERE THERE FOR.

93
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,560
WE SMELLED
LIKE WEED, THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE

94
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
DOING.

95
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,020
I WAS WORKING IN
CINCINNATI, IN JOHN BOEHNER'S

96
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,070
DISTRICT, TELLING JOKES, YOU CAN
DRIVE RIGHT OVER SO WE DID.

97
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,780
>>I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE
HIGH AT A DINOSAUR MUSEUM.

98
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,200
THAT'S THE MOST TERRIFYING
THING.

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,190
>>IT WAS SADDER THAN EXPECTED
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT

100
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,980
WOULD BE OTHER PEOPLE WITH THEIR
CHILDREN, AND THEY ARE BRINGING

101
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,070
THEIR KIDS AND IT'S LIKE, I FEEL
LIKE THEY ARE DOING CHILD ABUSE

102
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,730
TO THEM, WHICH THEY ARE.

103
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,740
BECAUSE
THEY ARE MISINFORMING THEIR

104
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,560
KIDS, THEY ARE ANTI-SCIENCE-ING
THEIR KIDS, THEY ARE TEACHING

105
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,990
THEM TO DO COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.

106
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,420
THIS ISN'T SCIENCE, THIS IS

107
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
CRAZY PEOPLE LIKE ISIS AND AL
QAEDA, ONLY THEY ARE WHITE

108
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
AND LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

109
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
>>THIS IS A MUSEUM BUT THEY SAY
DINOSAURS WERE CREATED IN

110
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
OUR COUNTRY?

111
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
>>ADAM AND EVE LIVED WITH
DINOSAURS.

112
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
THE CREATION MUSEUM.

113
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
>>WOW.

114
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
SO ROY MOORE, HE WON THE
PRIMARY, AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF

115
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER HE HAS
A CHANCE TO WIN IN ALABAMA, HE'S

116
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
A REPUBLICAN, BUT HE HAS RUN FOR
GOVERNOR BEFORE AND LOST, SOME

117
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ROY
MOORE IS IN 2012 HE RAN FOR

118
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND HE
BARELY, BARELY WON AGAINST

119
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
SOMEONE WHO JUST WAS A LATE
ENTRANT, HE BARELY WON THAT RACE

120
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
IN A RACE WHERE OBAMA GOT BEAT
BY ROMNEY BY DOZENS OF POINTS.

121
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
SO ROY MOORE POLLS BEHIND THE
NATIONAL AVERAGE.

122
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
DOUG JONES IS

123
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
A PROSECUTOR, THEY ARE SPLIT, NO
ONE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO

124
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
HAPPEN.

125
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
>>I KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

126
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
THE ALL-POWERFUL HAND OF

127
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,420
THE RUSSIANS WILL COME IN AND
THROW THIS ELECTION.

128
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
DID YOU

129
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
KNOW THAT THE RUSSIANS SPENT
ALMOST $100,000 ON FACEBOOK?

130
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
IT'S LIKE, WHAT ARE
YOU, DOCTOR EVIL?

131
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
THEY SPEND $2 BILLION --

132
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
$100,000, IT'S NOT 1976, THAT'S
NOT A LOT OF MONEY.

133
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,420
>>BEFORE WE WRAP UP WE WILL SHOW
SOME THINGS THAT ROY MOORE PUT

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
UP OR SHARED ON FACEBOOK.

135
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,420
ONE
WAS, WANT TO STOP RIOTS?

136
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
HE

137
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
SHOWS BLACK PEOPLE ON A CAR --
PLAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, THEY

138
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
WILL ALL SIT DOWN.

139
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,200
>>THEY DIDN'T SHOW THAT THE COP
JUST SHOT SIX UNARMED BLACK GUYS

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,550
BEFORE HE JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR.

141
00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:01,220
>>HERE IS ANOTHER ONE, WOULD THE
OPPRESSED MILLIONAIRE

142
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,320
QUARTERBACK WHO WOULDN'T STAND
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM POINT

143
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,710
OUT WHICH OF THESE GUYS WAS
BLACK SO WE CAN REMOVE THE

144
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,030
OFFENSIVE FLAG?

145
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:20,860
>>THAT IS 

146
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,930
USING DEAD SOLDIERS TO
COME I DON'T KNOW, FURTHER YOUR

147
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,520
RACISM.

148
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,299
BECAUSE APPARENTLY IF
YOU ARE BLACK AND POOR YOU

149
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,449
AREN'T ALLOWED TO PROTEST, AND
IF YOU ARE BLACK AND RICH YOU

150
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,450
AREN'T ALLOWED TO PROTEST.

151
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,169
IF
YOU ARE BLACK YOU AREN'T ALLOWED

152
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,169
TO PROTEST.

153
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,830
BUT HE CAN SING THE
LAND OF DIXIE, HE DOESN'T HAVE

154
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,160
ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CONFEDERATE
FLAG OR SINGING THE PRETEND

155
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,080
NATIONAL ANTHEM OF THE GROUP OF
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO OVERTHROW THE

156
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,270
COUNTRY, THE ACTUAL
SECESSIONISTS --

157
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,960
IN FACT THEY HAVE SECESSIONIST
PARTIES EVERY YEAR, DON'T THEY?

158
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,880
>>AND THEIR GOAL, VERY CLEARLY,
THEY WANT TO REMAKE OUR

159
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,700
GOVERNMENT AS A RELIGIOUS
GOVERNMENT, WHICH REALLY

160
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,200
CONCERNS ME BECAUSE THEY ARE
SAYING THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE IS

161
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,770
BEYOND REPAIR, WHICH I THINK
WHERE I WATCH SO MUCH CONGRESS I

162
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,800
SEE IT PLAY OUT IN REAL TIME,
YOU HAVE THESE RELIGIOUS PEOPLE

163
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,570
AIMING TO DISMANTLE OUR
GOVERNMENT.

164
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,800
THAT IS THE FIRST

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,450
STEP TO GETTING THIS NEW
GOVERNMENT, THAT THEY CAN MAKE

166
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,580
IT BE AROUND JESUS OR WHATEVER
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO, THEY WANT

167
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,160
TO APPLY A BIBLICAL WORLDVIEW TO
CIVIL LAW AND GOVERNMENT.

168
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
IT

169
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,400
MAKES SENSE, WE WILL HAVE ONE
MORE OF THESE REALLY RELIGIOUS

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,050
PEOPLE IN OUR GOVERNMENT WITH
MORE THAN A TAD OF RACISM

171
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,010
ATTACHED TO HIM -- WHEN I LOOK
AT THE BIG PICTURE WE HAVE A

172
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,960
PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY OF
RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT, I THINK

173
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,520
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE RELIGION
PROBLEM IN OUR LEGISLATURE RIGHT

174
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,240
NOW. AND HE WOULD JUST BE
ANOTHER ONE THAT WOULD BE VOTING

175
00:09:50,240 --> 00:00:00,000
BIBLICALLY INSTEAD OF WHAT IS
BETTER FOR SOCIETY.
