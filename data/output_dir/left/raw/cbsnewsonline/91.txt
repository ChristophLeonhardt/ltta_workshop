1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,334
THE JURY. 

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,303
HE SAID THAT IS BECAUSE HE HAS 

3
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:04,537
RECEIVED THREATS AND CRITICISM 

4
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,806
AS A RESULT OF THIS CASE AND HE 

5
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,307
DOES NOT WANT TO SCARE ANYONE 

6
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:12,579
ELSE FROM SERVING ON A FUTURE 

7
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:12,779
JURY. 

8
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,913
WE WILL NOT GET THOSE NAMES. 

9
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,115
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT 

10
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:15,949
THE MEDIA WILL APPEAL. 

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,484
WE DO NOT HAVE A VERDICT, THERE 

12
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:20,754
IS A LOT GOING ON. 

13
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,822
>>WE FORGET HOW HIGH-LEVEL THE 

14
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,424
SECURITY RISK CAN BE FOR SOME 

15
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:28,528
OF THESE TRIALS. 

16
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,662
IF THE TRIAL DOES STRETCH INTO 

17
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,564
NEXT WEEK IS THAT BAD NEWS FOR 

18
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:32,499
THE PROSECUTION? 

19
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,234
>> SO FAR I THINK IT IS IN THE 

20
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,668
REASONABLE TRY -- TIMEFRAME FOR 

21
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,205
A JURY OF 12 PEOPLE TO COME UP 

22
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,741
WITH A CONCLUSION ON 18 

23
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:46,880
DIFFERENT COUNTS. 

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,347
THERE IS LIKELY DEBATE IN THE 

25
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:49,082
JURY ROOM ABOUT REASONABLE 

26
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:49,816
DOUBT. 

27
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,084
WHAT THAT MEANS. 

28
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,685
IT APPEARS THAT THERE HAS TO BE 

29
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:53,620
SOME SORT OF DISCORD ABOUT 

30
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,621
WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNMENT 

31
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,755
MET ITS BURDEN IN THIS CASE. 

32
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,092
THAT WILL TAKE UP MORE TIME. 

33
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,126
THEY ALSO HAVE HAD QUESTIONS 

34
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,594
ABOUT TECHNICAL TERMS USED IN 

35
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,798
THE CASE. 

36
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,299
THAT IS A SIGNAL THAT THEY ARE 

37
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,033
BEING METHODICAL AND VERY 

38
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:07,333
DELIBERATE. 

39
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,769
THAT WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME. 

40
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,537
THESE ARE VERY COMPLICATED 

41
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:10,804
CHARGES. 

42
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,004
HE IS CHARGED WITH FILING FALSE 

43
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,541
TAX RETURNS, FAILING TO FILE 

44
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:20,613
REPORTS OF A BANK ACCOUNT. 

45
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,748
THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE, 

46
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,749
THERE IS A LOT OF PHYSICAL 

47
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,084
DOCUMENTS, THERE IS A LOT OF 

48
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,318
TESTIMONY, IT IS GOING TO TAKE 

49
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,486
TIME TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING 

50
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:26,786
LIKE THIS. 

51
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,453
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO 

52
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,522
WEIGHEDIN ON THIS TRIAL. 

53
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,325
I WANT TO PLAY SOME OF HIS 

54
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:32,625
SOUNDBITE. 

55
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,661
>>I THINK THE WHOLE MANAFORT 

56
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,630
TRIAL IS VERY SAD WHEN YOU LOOK 

57
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,831
AT WHAT IS GOING ON. 

58
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,334
I THINK IT IS A SAD DAY FOR OUR 

59
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,302
COUNTRY. 

60
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,469
HE WORKED FOR ME FOR A VERY 

61
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,270
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 

62
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,938
HE HAPPENS TO BE A VERY GOOD 

63
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:49,075
PERSON. I THINK IT IS VERY SAD 

64
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,010
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO PAUL 

65
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,477
MANAFORT. 

66
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:55,448
>>THE PRESIDENT IS VERY 

67
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:55,748
PASSIONATE. 

68
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,516
WE KNOW THAT MANAFORT IS 

69
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,483
BANKING ON A PRESIDENTIAL 

70
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:57,716
PARDON. 

71
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:01,020
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 

72
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,188
>> THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

73
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,189
HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO SINCE 

74
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:03,823
MANAFORT WAS INDICTED. 

75
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,125
FIRST HE HAS TRIED TO DISTANCE 

76
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,025
HIMSELF SAYING HE ONLY WORKED 

77
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,860
FOR ME FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF 

78
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,595
TIME. 

79
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:10,496
FIVE MONTHS IS NOT EXTENDED BUT 

80
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:13,333
IT IS A CRUCIAL AMOUNT OF TIME. 

81
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,934
HE WANTS TO DISTANCE HIMSELF 

82
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,870
FROM MANAFORT AND MAKE SURE 

83
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,171
THAT THIS CASE HAS NOTHING TO 

84
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,238
DO WITH HIM OR THE CAMPAIGN. 

85
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:20,440
THE SECOND THING THE PRESIDENT 

86
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,109
IS TRYING TO DO IS PAINT 

87
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:23,910
MANAFORT AS A VICTIM. 

88
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,744
HE IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE 

89
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:28,181
POSSIBILITY IF HE HAS TO GRANT 

90
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:28,982
HIM A PARDON. 

91
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,016
HE WANTS TO FRAME MANAFORT IN 

92
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,819
THE SAME WAY HE HAS FRAMED JOE 

93
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,254
ARPAIO OR SCOOTER LIBBY OTHER 

94
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:42,595
PEOPLE HE HAS GRANTED --. 

95
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,997
HE WANTS MANAFORT TO BE ONE OF 

96
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,297
A PATTERN. 

97
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,532
I THINK SEEING THE PRESIDENT 

98
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,467
ANSWER QUESTIONS IN THIS WAY, 

99
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,536
DISTANCE AND THEN TRY TO INVOKE 

100
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:54,474
SYMPATHY FOR MANAFORT. 

101
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,074
>>INTERESTING. 

102
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,276
BREAKING NEWS FROM THE MANAFORT 

103
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,777
TRIAL THEY MAY NOT GET A 

104
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,846
VERDICT TODAY. 

105
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,880
THE JURY HAS REQUESTED TO LEAVE 

106
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,681
BY 5 PM. 

107
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,915
I CANNOT BLAME THEM THEY ARE 

108
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:09,389
ONLY A FEW SUMMER DAYS LEFT. 

109
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,823
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT TIME THEY 

110
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,958
WANT TO COME BACK ON MONDAY. 

111
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,895
THAT MAYGIVE US A CLUE. 

112
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,530
MAYBE THEY WILL ONLY HAVE A FEW 

113
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,331
HOURS LEFT, IF THEY'RE WILLING 

114
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,565
TO COME IN THE AFTERNOON THAT 

115
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,200
IS THE SIGN THAT THEY HAVE A 

116
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,034
LOT OF WORK. 

117
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,503
>>PAULA REID THANK YOU FOR 

118
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,673
