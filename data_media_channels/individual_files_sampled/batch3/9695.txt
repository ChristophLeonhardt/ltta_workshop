WHINING ABOUT THE CULT OF TRUMP AFTER EIGHT YEARS OVER SWOONING OVER THE REAL MESSIAH, OBAMA. BUT WE BEGIN WITH BROAD SIDES FROM TEAM TRUMP ON THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION. STARTING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, SHOT AT THE FBI BRASS AND CHIEF, THE CHIEF HE FIRED, OF COURSE JIM COMEY. ON FOX AND FRIENDS THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT TOOK A SWIPE AT WHAT HE CALLED THE SCUM AT THE TOP OF THE BUREAU UNDER OBAMA. THE FBI LOOKS BAD, VERY BAD. NO, IT'S COMEY. INTERPRET TALKING ABOUT COMEY, NOT MY FBI. THE PEOPLE IN THE FBI ARE INCREDIBLE. I WOULD BET IF YOU TOOK A POLL IN THE FBI, I WOULD WIN THAT POLL BY MORE THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER WON A POLL. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. THEY WERE PLOTTING AGAINST MY ELECTION. PRESIDENTIAL ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI SAID COMEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATE AND THAT THE FBI AGENT "FIRED TODAY AND IN PRISON NEXT WEEK." LET'S INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS. LET'S STOP AND LET'S TURN AND GET RID OF ALL THE AGENTS DURING THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. HE SHOULDN'T BE WORKING AT THE FBI. HE'S GOT EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS AND PROBABLY NEEDS VALIUM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HE VOWED TO STOP TRUMP FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT. STRZOK IS NOW FACING HIS OWN DAY OF RECKONING. STRZOK WAS THE LEAD FBI AGENT, REMEMBER, IN THE CLINTON EMAIL PROBE, A TOP AGENT IN THE FBI'S RUSSIA PROBE, AND THE AGENT WHO INTERVIEWED FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR MIKE FLYNN. ALL THAT ENDED OF COURSE WHEN STRZOK'S BOMBASTIC ANTI-TRUMP TEXTS WERE REVEALED. HE WAS DEMOTED TO THE FBI'S HR DEPARTMENT. WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY THE HECK IS HE STILL WORKING AT THE FBI, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE TEXT MESSAGE REVEALED YESTERDAY WHERE HE VOWED TO STOP TRUMP FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT. JOINING ME NOW, JOHN, ATTORNEY, AND FORMER ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROBERT DRISCOLL. ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO START WITH YOU, BOB, ON THIS, BECAUSE IT'S FASCINATING TO ME HOW WHEN YOU SURVEY THE OTHER NETWORKS OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS, IT WAS LIKE ON TO STORMY DANIELS. THEY SPENT PRECIOUS LITTLE TIME ON THIS. THIS IS A BIG NOTHING BURGER. I'M SO SICK OF THAT WORD, BY THE WAY. BUT LET'S REMEMBER WHAT HOROWITZ DID CONCLUDE. THIS IS IMPORTANT. DEPARTING SO CLEARLY AND DRAMATICALLY, THE DECISIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT AS FAIR ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE. ROBERT, FAIR ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE NOW WITH A RUSSIA COLLUSION PROBE GONE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, ABOUT $18 MILLION IT'S COST, APPARENTLY WITH NO END IN SIGHT. THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE. THE REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THERE WAS RAMPANT BIAS WITH THE FBI AND THE DOJ. ALL THE REPORT SAYS, AND I THINK PEOPLE TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT. THE REPORT SAYS THAT HOROWITZ COULDN'T LINK THE EXAMPLES OF BIAS TO ANY PARTICULAR INVESTIGATIVE DECISION. WHICH OF COURSE HE COULDN'T. NO ONE WRITES DOWN WHEN THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT IMPROPER. BUT HE FOUND BIAS ON EACH PAGE. INVESTIGATIVE DECISION WAS DEFENSIBLE. NOT PROPER, BUT JUST DEFENSIBLE, HE PASSED ON IT. SO I THINK IT REALLY IS, TO ME, SHOCKINGLY BAD, BOTH THE BREADTH OF THE REPORT AND BIAS AND CORRUPTION WAS SHOCKING. PETER STRZOK IS STILL COLLECTING A TAXPAYER-FUNDED SALARY, WHICH, I MEAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S STILL WORKING, AND OF ALL PLACES, IN HUMAN RESOURCES. THAT JUST TAKES THE CAKE. YOU CAN'T WRITE HOW STUPID THAT IS. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE BOB GOODLATTE DOES WANT HIM TO TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL. HE'S GETTING THAT SUBPOENA. THE PROCESS TAKES ABOUT TWO DAYS. BUT HE WANTS STRZOK ON CAPITOL HILL AND HE WANTS INFORMATION AND HE WANTS IT LIKE YESTERDAY. RIGHT. AND THE QUESTION IS, WHEN YOU READ THIS SHOCKING REPORT, WHY HE'S HAD THIS JOB FOR SO LONG, STRZOK, AND WRAY, WHO THE PRESIDENT WAS PRAISING IN HIS TWEETS, WHY THEY HAVEN'T DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ALREADY. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF BIAS. WE SEE THE SHOCKING INSTANCE OF THE TEXT THAT HE SENT BACK TO HIS LOVER ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T GOING TO LET TRUMP BECOME THE PRESIDENT. THAT WAS WITH HELD FROM CONGRESS. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A VERY THOROUGH REPORT, BUT THE CONCLUSION IS, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE A SMOKING GUN, SO WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG WITH AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL INVESTIGATION. THEY DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO CUT IT HERE WITH THE DAMAGE DONE TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE DAMAGE BEING DONE WITH THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. IT REQUIRES STRONGER MEASURES THAN SIMPLY AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT WENT WRONG. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. JOHN, THE DAMAGE TO THE FBI, I THINK, CANNOT BE OVERSTATED HERE. WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK SO HARD IN THE FIELD OFFICES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, DAY BY DAY, NIGHT BY NIGHT, TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE AND DO REALLY GREAT INVESTIGATIVE WORK. THIS ENDED UP BEING A POLITICAL RESEARCH OPERATION AGAINST ULTIMATELY, AGAINST THE PRESIDENT WITH THE RUSSIA PROBE, BUT A CYA SITUATION WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN THESE EMAILS ALL ALONG. IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS REPORT I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH MOST OF IT THERE IS A LOT IN THIS REPORT THAT THE PRESS IS GLOSSING OVER. YOU'RE RIGHT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS SOME HORRIBLE THINGS WERE DONE THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER OCCURRED. WE HAVE TO KEEP IT IN THE CONTEXT THOUGH. REMEMBER, THIS IS A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW EACH OTHER. SOME WERE HAND PICKED BY THEIR FRIENDS TO WORK IN THIS PROJECT, IF YOU WILL. MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE 35,000 FBI EMPLOYEES DOING GOOD THINGS EVERY DAY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THEY NEED TO COME CLEAN. YOU'RE RIGHT. WHETHER OR NOT MR. STRZOK SHOULD BE WORKING AT FBI HEADQUARTERS IS CERTAINLY A QUESTION WE'RE ASKING. THE IG DID NOT SAY HE FOUND NO BIAS AT THE FBI. HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE THAT BIAS PRODUCED SPECIFIC DECISIONS. AND WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, THERE'S ANOTHER IG REPORT COMING DOWN THE PIKE. THAT COULD END UP BEING LOADED WITH EVIDENCE OF SUCH BIAS BECAUSE THAT'S ABOUT LOOKING INTO THE INFORMANTS THAT WERE USED IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND MAYBE THE POTENTIAL FISA ABUSES, THE FBI HANDLING OF THE RUSSIA PROBE. I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU, BOB. THINKING THE IG TRUMP WAS ANNOYED TODAY. HE PETERED OUT AT THE END. I THINK THIS OTHER REPORT COULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN SEEING WHAT HAPPENS TO PLACED INDIVIDUALS OR ENCOURAGED INDIVIDUALS TO TRY TO PENETRATE THESE LOWER-LEVEL PEOPLE INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN. WE'LL FIND THE BASIS FOR THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS THE DOSSIER ORIGINALLY OR THE OPPOSITION RESEARCH GENERATED INVESTIGATION TOTALLY OR NOT. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'LL BE ABLE TO LAY IT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE IG REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT. IT'LL PROVIDE CONTEXT. IN THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION, WE HAVE THE GUY BEING GRANTED IMMUNITY FOR ESSENTIALLY NOTHING. NO PROSECUTION. I MEAN, ALL THOSE THINGS MAY BE DEFENSIBLE INDIVIDUALLY IN A VACUUM, BUT AN INCREDIBLY LIGHT TOUCH FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVER GONE THROUGH AN FBI INVESTIGATION. AND WE'LL GET TO COMPARE THAT TO, GEE, WHAT DO YOU KNOW, PEOPLE'S HOUSES ARE BEING SEARCHED AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING. AND SO I THINK THIS SECOND REPORT COULD HAVE COULD BE A BIG DEAL, COULD FILL IN SOME OF THESE GAPS, GETTING THIS PROFESSOR IN LONDON. ALL THIS STUFF THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO. MY GOODNESS, THEY WERE LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED. TRYING TO GET A RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE TO HELP. THEY'LL DOING EVERYTHING. MEANWHILE WITH HILLARY, IT'S LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GET THE WIENER LAPTOP. MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT ON THAT. SO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH, WHICH ALSO COMES THROUGH WHEN YOU READ THE TOTALITY OF THIS REPORT. GIULIANI TODAY TALKED ABOUT THE QUESTION WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MONTHS HERE ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TESTIFY. I WANT YOU ALL TO LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN NOW IN THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION? THEY SHOULD END IT. THE IG REPORT BASICALLY TELLS YOU THAT BOTH PRONGS OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION ARE EITHER CORRUPT OR ANSWERED. AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT HE BASICALLY SAID NO INTERVIEW. THE PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERED WITH IT. ANY THINKING OF YOUR EXCHANGE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE POSSIBLE PERJURY TRAP? PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKES TO TALK. HE LOVES TO GET HIS POINT ACROSS. HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, HE SAYS. SO HE'S LIKE, I'M HAPPY TO TALK. HE WANTS TO TALK. BUT AS A LAWYER, I'M A LAWYER AS WELL, HOW DANGEROUS IS IT FOR HIM TO GO INTO THAT SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE? SO AS FOR THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION, DOES IT CHANGE ANYTHING? NO. FROM DAY ONE, I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T TALK. THEY'RE THE GUNNERS. THEY'RE THE GO-GETTERS. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WANT TO MAKE THEIR CASE AND NAME. NO BIGGER PREY THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE SHOULD NOT GO IN THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONFIDENCE THAT THE DECK WON'T BE STACKED AGAINST HIM. WE'VE SEEN THAT. BUT IN TERMS OF WITNESSES, A CEO, A POWERFUL PERSON IS THE WORST WITNESS. THEY'RE USED TO GETTING THEIR WAY. EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM SUCKS UP TO THEM. IT'S JUST A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SCENARIO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING EVEN SEEMINGLY CASUALLY TO A PROSECUTOR OR FBI AGENT. IT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE FOR ANY CEO OR PRESIDENT, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR THIS PRESIDENT. NOW WE'VE SEEN THE CORRUPTION PERVADING THE FBI. SO ABSOLUTELY NOT. GIULIANI'S POINT TODAY WAS, NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN, WE KNOW JUST WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THERE WITH THE DESPERATE EFFORT TO STOP HIM FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT, AND SHE GETS TO SIT IN THERE WHEN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD SUBPOENA HILLARY, THE COZY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESS AND THE FBI AGENTS, THE PRESS ARE GIVING PERKS TO THE FBI AGENTS. THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE LEAKS CAME FROM. TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU, JOHN, BECAUSE WE HAVE JOHN WHO EXCLUSIVELY GAVE US A COMMENT TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT THIS IG REPORT ACTUALLY SAYS. THE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF HIS USURP OF POWER, VIOLATION OF OATH OF OFFICE, AND MATERIAL FALSE STATEMENTS OF THE PUBLIC AND CONGRESS, ALL TO CONCEAL HIS OWN CONDUCT. THE FINDING OF NO BIAS WAS LUDICROUS. THE OIG'S FINDINGS SUPPORT THE DECISION TO FIRE COMEY. ABSOLUTELY. HE WAS FIRED BECAUSE OF THE THINGS HE HAD DONE AND THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT TO TAKE THOSE ACTIONS. I ALSO THINK A LOT OF THINGS HAVE BEEN MADE OUT OF THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT FIRED THE DIRECTOR OF THE FBI. IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED. WE SAW IT WITH WILLIAM SESSIONS. BUT THIS IS CLEARLY BASED ON THE REPORT WE'RE SEEING, GIVES GOOD CAUSE AND JUSTIFICATION TO THE ACTIONS THE PRESIDENT TOOK. THERE WAS ALSO THE SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT TODAY. A FEDERAL JUDGE APPOINTED BY OBAMA ACTUALLY JAILED PAUL AFTER MUELLER CLAIMED HE TRIED TO TAMPER WITH WITNESSES. GIULIANI RESPONDED BY FLOATING THE IDEA OF PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. ROBERT, THIS LED JEFFREY TO SAY THE FOLLOWING ABOUT GIULIANI. WATCH. IT IS SO CORRUPT AND UNETHICAL WHAT GIULIANI SAID. I MEAN, WE ARE IN AN AREA HERE THAT IS LITERALLY UNPRECEDENTEDED BECAUSE NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICAN LIFE HAVE THE POWER TO GIVE A PARDON. WE ARE SO FAR OUT OF NORMAL ETHICAL BEHAVIOR, THAT IT'S JUST WORTH PRESERVING OUR SENSE OF OUTRAGE ABOUT IT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS STUFF HAPPENS EVERY DAY. BUT IT REALLY IS APPALLING. A SENSE OF OUTRAGE. JEFFREY AND THAT OUTRAGE. ROBERT, NEVERTHELESS, THE THROWING OUT THE PARDON THING. I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT IF I WERE RUDY TODAY. WELL, AND THE OTHER REASON TOO IS JUST STRATEGICALLY AS A DEFENSE LAWYER, I WOULDN'T WANT HIM PARDONED BEFORE THE CASE IS OVER. AND SO IF HE IS PARDONED, HE NO LONGER FACING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. HE COULD CONCEIVABLY BE FORCED TO TESTIFY. AND MORE OVER, THERE'S JUST NO REASON TO HANDLE IT NOW. YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE WHERE THE CHIPS FALL. AND IF SOME POINT LATER THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO PARDON, HE CAN. AS FAR AS BEING UNPRECEDENTED, GEORGE BUSH SR. PARDONED THE DAY BEFORE THE TRIAL. IT'S BEEN DONE. THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S THE INHERENT POWER THE PRESIDENT HAS. THERE'S NO REAL CHECK ON IT. I JUST CAN'T GET THAT OUTRAGE THOUGH. THE ANSWER TO IT IS A POLITICAL ANSWER, WHICH IS IT WAS DONE PUBLICLY AND THE PRESIDENT CAN SUFFER BLOWBACKS IF HE DOES IT. AND WE HAD A MYRIAD OF INSTANCES WHERE THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WE HAD ERIC HOLDER HELD IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS OVER THE DOCUMENTS, I THINK IT WAS FAST AND FURIOUS. THERE'S NO MORAL OUTRAGE. GIVE ME A BREAK. YEAH. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GIVE HIM THE SMELLING SALT, THE SELECTIVE OUTRAMBLING, THE HYPOCRISY IS LAUGHABLE. THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED AS AMERICANS ABOUT THE CORRUPTION OF THE FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND NOT ABOUT THIS ONE INSTANCE. I OUTRAGED THAT A JUDGE IS APPEARING TO USE AN INCARCERATION AS A PENALTY AS A PUNISHMENT PRIOR TO A TRIAL. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE USED IN PREVENTIVE ATTENTION WHERE IT DEALS WITH FLIGHT RISKS AND OTHER ISSUES. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE OUTRAGED ABOUT. SHE WAS REALLY LECTURING TODAY SAYING BASICALLY YOU'RE NOT IN JUNIOR HIGH.
