KNOWN IN 2015, BARACK OBAMA NEVER WOULD'VE GOTTEN THE DEAL THROUGH. CHANTED RATES IRAN MUCH TO CONTEMPLATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS NOT TAKING TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT SLIGHTLY. INSTEAD, SPEAKING TO PROTECT A DEAL THEY STRUCK WITH THE AYATOLLAH. SOME WARNING THAT TAKING APART THE IRAN DEAL WILL SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HEADS TOWARDS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ROGUE MACHINE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WITH YJ FISCHER, FORMER STATEMENT OFFICIAL UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE IRAN DEAL. JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. THANK YOU. Shannon: I WANT TO CONTRAST A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IN 2015 IS THE DEAL CAME TOGETHER WITH WHAT PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAD TO SAY TODAY. THIS FRAMEWORK WOULD CUT OFF EVERY PATHWAY THAT IRAN COULD TAKE TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THE NUCLEAR DEAL GIVES THE IRAN A CLEAR PATH TO AN ATOMIC ARSENAL. Shannon: WHY JAY, WE WILL START WITH YOU. WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG? IT'S WHAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN SAYING. BEBE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. HE HAD THE SLIDE THAT SAYS "IRAN LIED." OF COURSE THEY LIED. THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE THE DEAL. IF THEY DIDN'T LIE WE COULD TRUST THEM. WE WOULD NEED THE DEAL. IT COULD BE BASED ON FAITH AND GOODWILL. THE REASON WE HAVE THE DEAL WITH ITS INTENSE VERIFICATION WAS GENERAL MATUS WAS CALLING ROBUST IS BECAUSE THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT WE DON'T TRUST AND WE HAVE NEVER TRUSTED. GENERAL MATUS HAD A GREAT MIND ABOUT WHEN HE WAS LOOKING AT THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL. HE WAS SAYING THIS WAS WRITTEN WITH AN INTENT THAT IRAN WAS GOING TO TRY TO CHEAT AND TRY TO LIVE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE VERIFICATION OF 24/7 ACCESS TO KEY FACILITIES. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CONTINUOUS CAMERA ACCESS OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT POINTS OF ENTRY. THAT'S WHY THE IAEA INSPECTORS HAVE ACCESS TO ANY SITES, DECLARED OR UNDECLARED, CIVILIAN OR MILITARY. THIS IS A DEAL THAT'S WORKING. Shannon: YOU KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF CRITICS, INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY SAY THEY HAVE LIED TO INSPECTORS, THAT THERE IS NOT IMMEDIATE ACCESS. THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF DAYS OR WEEKS IN WHICH THEY MAY MOVE OR HIDE THINGS. HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY WHEN THE DEAL CAME BACK TOGETHER IN 2015. IT WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE PROGRESS OF THEIR PROGRAM, AND INSTEAD THEY DID NOT. ACCORDING TO THE ISRAELIS IN THESE DOCUMENTS, THEY ADMIT THEY STOLE, THEY SAY WHAT THEY HAVE SHOWS THINGS WEREN'T DESTROYED, THE PROGRAM WAS KEPT AT THE READY SO THAT WHEN THESE SANCTIONS ON THEM OR OTHER SAFEGUARDS ON THEM EVENTUALLY EXPIRED, THEY WOULD BE READY TO RAMP IT BACK UP. JASON, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT
