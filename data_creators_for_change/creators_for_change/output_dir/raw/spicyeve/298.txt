79
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,770
woke up the next morning and my hair

80
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,070
formed more of a puff then I did a twist

81
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,800
out it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like a big puff which I</font>

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,060
mean it's right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not really</font>

83
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,919
what I was going for so last night I

84
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,950
read twisted my hair with just this

85
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,530
didn't spread anything nothing didn't

86
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,470
hop in the shower I just use this and

87
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,750
time and time again I'm finding out that

88
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,539
this product<font color="#E5E5E5"> is amazing on dry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hair</font>

89
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,300

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,130
this up in my hair juicy moisturize soft

91
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,210

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,470
basically my product review like the

95
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">last video said those these two products</font>

96
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,700
are bomb what I repurchase this not

97
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,010
really because this doesn't do anything

98
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,130
that this can do but it's just I guess a

99
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,970
different form I guess but um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

100
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to use it I'll finish it and I</font>
