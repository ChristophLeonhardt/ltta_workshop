QUESTIONS ON THAT MATTER OR
ANYTHING BESIDES THE WALL
ISSUES.
WE'LL BE WAITING FOR THAT AHEAD
OF THAT.
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET A READ
OF THIS OF WHAT IS AT STAKE
HERE.
LISA IS A MIDDLE EAST ANALYST
LOOKING AT THIS AND SEPARATE
REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL
MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON IRAN
TOMORROW.
WE'RE TOLD RIGHT NOW THAT HE
LEANS, ALTHOUGH THAT COULD
CHANGE, TOWARD NIXING THE DEAL
AND NOT JUST FIXING THE DEAL.
IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEN WHAT?
>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PRESIDENT
THAT HAS PRESIDENT BEEN SHY
COMMUNICATING THE FACT THAT THIS
DEAL IS AN AWFUL DEAL.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS
PRESIDENT WORKS.
WE HAVE JOHN KERRY, AT THE VERY
BEST IS TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE
POLICY SET FORTH BY THE CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION.
AT THE VERY WORST, SOMETHING
ELSE AT PLAY.
WITH REGARDS TO DONALD TRUMP,
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHETHER HE
WILL NIX OR FIX THIS DEAL.
WHAT WE DO KNOW HE WILL USE
LEVERAGE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE TO
GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE
IRANIANS AT THIS MOMENT AND
PIGGYBACK ON THE SENTIMENTS OF
OTHERS.
YOU HAD MACRON, ANGELA MERKEL
COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
THEY EXPRESSED THE FACT THAT THE
DEAL IS NOT WORKING.
IN ADDITION THAT WE SHOULD KEEP
THE DEAL IN PLACE, IT'S NOT
WORKING.
>> Neil: I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AND
FRUSTRATED WITH IT, BUT THEY
THINK TO RIP IT UP WOULD BE A
BAD IDEA.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT
CAN DO.
HE WILL SURPRISE YOU.
EXPECTATIONS CAN CHANGE.
IF HE WERE TO RIP IT UP, PEOPLE
ARE EXCUSING THAT FOR OIL PRICES
TO GO HIGH, BUT ON THE BELIEF
THIS WILL LEAD TO DISCORD IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
YOU THINK IT WILL?
>> I DON'T THINK IT WILL LEAD TO
DISCOURSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
WE HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY.
WHETHER HE NIXS IT OR FIXES IT.
WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A
DISCUSSION ABOUT SANCTIONS AND
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN IRAN.
WE HAVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION --
ALL OF THESE UNCOMFORTABLE
TOPICS THAT WERE NEVER BROUGHT
UP TO BEGIN WITH.
LOOK AT THE COMPARISON HERE
BETWEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
YOU HAVE THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION, FOR EXAMPLE, IN
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO WITH
NORTH KOREA.
THEY'RE TAKING A LOOK AT REALITY
TO TRY TO COME UP WITH AN
OUTCOME.
WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
DID, THEY STARTED WITH AN
OUTCOME AND WHAT THEY DID IS
MANIPULATE REALITY TO GET TO
THAT OUTCOME TO GET THE DEAL.
IN MANIPULATING THAT REALITY,
THEY SIDE-STEPPED THE FACT THAT
IRAN IS IN NUMBER 1 STATE
SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, THE FACT
THAT THEY HAVE HANDS IN SYRIA
AND IN LEBANON AND IN YEMEN --
>> Neil: I DON'T THINK THEY
IGNORED THAT.
YOU'RE RIGHT TO SAY THAT.
BUT THEY BEGRUDGINGLY SIGNED ON
TO IT AND WERE AWARE OF THE
PROBLEMS.
BUT DO YOU THINK BY NIXING THIS
AND STARTING FROM SCRATCH,
ESPECIALLY WHEN IRAN GOT ALL
MONEY THEY WANTED, THAT THEY'LL
BE COMPELLED TO CHANGE?
>> NO.
THEY HAVE LEARNED TO WORK AROUND
THE LOOP HOLE OF SANCTIONS AND
THE PRESSURE OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
INCLUDING ISRAEL.
NETANYAHU CAN GIVE A GREAT
PRESENTATION OF THE FACTS, BUT
WHEN YOU HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND MANY DEMOCRATS PUTTING THE
PRESSURE ON TRUMP, IT'S
DIFFICULT TO USE THAT LEVERAGE
TO GET IRAN TO CHANGE.
DOES IRAN WANT TO STAY IN THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH
REGARDS TO TRADE, JUST HAVING
THAT GOOD NORMALIZED RELATIONS?
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY DO WHEN
THEY'RE STILL FLEXING MUSCLES.
