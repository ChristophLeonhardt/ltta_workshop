hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report you heard that women are so disgusted with men lately that more and more they're having sex with fish don't trust me look this up it's incredible anyway let's move on Stacy actually yeah we're gonna be talking about Bill Kristol I don't know if you're talking about him but he kind of looks like a fish to me but let's see first we're gonna talk about we're gonna talk this whole episode by the way I'm gonna stay here for both halves and that is because we're gonna talk about some fracking and first I want to you know qualify to the audience full and fair disclosure we our show is broadcast on our Russian network so one should assume Russian trolls post-election strategy disrupt Florida and other US energy pipelines all right I got I got a special power of paper here alright that keyphrases which I'm gonna have some fun with over on this side too just to let people know so the first one is Russian trolls okay Russian trolls well you know the best way for television is actually just hold it up to the camera first can't you write it down like up here no okay so a three billion dollar sable trail pipeline designed to carry natural gas to this state of Florida from Alabama there were some protests against that in December 2016 and McClatchy News has kind of looked into the DNI report and determined that actually it was because RT covered that and they mentioned RT but because there were some Russian trolls they say on Twitter that inflamed the protests the Florida people themselves have no agency they themselves couldn't possibly ever think that well I don't want to pipeline outside my house no forget that obviously stupid people in like da Floridians don't have agency just look at the news any that all the news of the weird comes from Florida but Russia's hidden hand in the Florida pipeline protest was extensive according to sources familiar with the operations at least eight Russian a counts most tied to the troll farm known as the internet research agency sent at least 16 social media messages excoriating the sabol trail pipeline or retweeting messages from one of its most prominent opponents a frequent guest on RT the tweets were sent to a total of more than 40,000 followers as well as anyone else who saw them via hashtags this is real dr. evil stuff max we must uncover this story so that by the way the prominent opponent of the pipeline through Florida was Kim Canova who is a progressive Democrat who ran against the Deborah Wasserman Schultz who is you know basically Hillary Clinton's buddy and a neocon neoconservative neoliberal sort of Democrat anyway so the progressive Democrat they're all Russian BOTS all right well the theme that's emerging here is it relates to the energy industry yes okay this is an underlying theme yes that you're gonna be exploring as I understand it yes and of course the energy industry in America is possibly the most corrupt of all industries and so they need this type of media manipulation and scapegoating to justify two very important facts that they're responsible for one is inclusion with Wall Street and the financing of their industry they've traded the biggest wealth and income gap in the history of the world and bigger than the robber barons and hope addicts from coast to coast and to an environmental Holocaust what they don't want to point that out the externalities of these energy companies end up in our cancer cells thank you energy company they want to point that out so there's got to be an existential threat it's got to be coming from somewhere yes so I want to read this final paragraph here in order to set up our headlines we're gonna cover because according to remember consider this the this is McClatchy they've won Pulitzer and they're like legitimate you know a legitimate news source here so you must abide by their what they say the social media propaganda was part of a broad Kremlin campaign to disrupt the booming American energy industry which seemingly overnight has emerged as a threat to Russia's global dominance US authorities say notice that freeze they often use in the progressive so-called progressive media whenever they talk about these so-called Russian BOTS and trolls they always say US authorities say even though this statement this assertion is easily any journalist could set could go investigate use google research the stuff and make their own determination they get out of having to basically sully their own reputation this is what I was remembering the US authorities say phrase yes that's the key phrase yes so McClatchy Newspapers instead of sending out a journalist to go discover the truth and do journalism they write us boilerplate shipped them from the Pentagon or from Exxon and they cover it by saying US authorities say yes not that they're journalists say not that we have any journalists not that we're not propaganda Meister's no US authorities say therefore we don't question it now that's not journalism by the way that is by definition propaganda propaganda McClatchy Newspapers you you cop to be propagandist continue please go look at go use google and search for yourself they'll say like US authorities say RT supported trump US authorities say they all the material is fully available freely available on youtube you could go watch all the hours of footage leading up to the u.s. elections and see whether or not yourself you could determine that is true but nobody has nobody ever challenges that nobody challenges it because you're too freaking lazy and you're just taking heroin and eating trans fats and worrying about what genitalia is appropriate for your cotillion and transitioning is something that maybe you'll regret in five minutes just look at the facts okay so we're gonna look at some stories because you and I have been covering fracking for a long time but we've been covering it because we cover Marcos finance and scandal we cover finance the stupidity of financing something that loses we're gonna cover some of those from CNBC and Bloomberg News the articles from there and only in the past month these articles have come out we've also covered it because we do we've have a long history here our tea at BBC world and an al-jazeera covering basically peak oil and also renewables the emergence of renewables so fossil fuels squeezed by plunge and cost of renewables BN e F says as Bloomberg New Energy Finance the economics of generating electricity from fossil fuels are deteriorating rapidly as renewable energy technology plunges and costs that's the conclusion of Bloomberg New Energy Finance report on the levelized cost of energy a measure that takes into account the expenses from buying equipment servicing debt and operating power plants using each technology in most places wind and solar will work cheaper than coal by 2023 according to the research they have found and also we're gonna go over the details but just show you the sheer scale of the drop in the past year to in the price of solar technology solar provision of electronics electricity and power and a lot of it has to do with China and batteries and batteries again from China which is ironic because like a lot of this whole Russia Gate stuff that the theory that if you care about the environment or if you care about fracking and we've always mostly covered it on a financial how stupid financial investment is and that you know if you're going to invest as a government you would better off investing in solar and wind and clean technologies renewable technologies right just like just a smart choice that's just like obvious right so that right now a lot of the the claims that is Russian trolls or Russian boss or that somehow Russia which by the way produces natural gas and oil doesn't need to frack it it's just like puts a straw on it like comes out so it's so absurd but that a lot of it comes from Bill Crystal's group Hamilton's see eight and bill kristol by the way is the co-founder of policy for the new American Century which he presented to Bill Clinton and his last year in office he tried to get Bill Clinton to invade Iraq and part of it well they lay it out in their own words go read it you could download it just go to Google policy for a new American Century and look at their report that they put out Rumsfeld Cheney Bill Kristol and they said part of the reason why they needed they said to invade Iraq was to control the oil reserves and so that China didn't get them so it's quite ironic that China is putting all of this this whole oil and carbon based industry out of business by just driving down the cost of solar wind and other renewable energy technologies well Bill Kristol was so wrong about the project for a new American Century and how the energy industry would develop over the following 50 years yes and completely missed the fact that renewables the solar energy the costs would plummet down that asymptotic curve toward zero the same thing is seeing the microchip industry in the bandwidth industry in that technology industries be becoming uber eyes or Silicon Valley eyes and he's so powerful and he's so embarrassed that his way of relieving himself of the embarrassment of being probably the biggest idiot that's walked the face of the earth the past 50 years is a start of war with Russia and sent as many young kids there to die as possible so I don't think it's bad I think it's just he's putting tinfoil on he's spreading conspiracy theories in order to confuse and create chaos and people's understanding of the world around them so I think he wants people to forget it goes into the memory hole the memory hole is helped by creating all sorts of chaos and and concerns guest lighting it's more than just Bill Kristol acting like that movie Gaslight people's underwear and their drawers so they get confused he's actually starting but I want to really talk about how stupid fracking is based on just the stupid economic yeah yeah and here we're gonna go you mentioned lithium iron battery so one new factor in the cost of why renewables are so much cheaper lithium-ion batteries have enjoyed a 79 percent drop in costs since 2010 making the idea of storing energy a possibility for coming years the price per megawatt hour for generating from wind farms built on land fell 18% in just the first half of 2018 and we're not even at the first the end of the first half to $55 while photovoltaics dropped 18% to $70 so we're already the the costs are plummeting we have some more in the second half about how much the costs are plummeting and what those sort of plummeting costs due to the existing infrastructure grid and the sunk costs into hugely expensive nuclear energy products projects coal and and the debt to service all that so so we're gonna talk about that book mr. fuller you know 30 40 years ago said that earth uses less than 1% of the energy it gets every single day from the Sun okay now 40 years later we're finally harvesting that energy and it was as predictable as night follows day and anyone who backed their future on fossil fuels is going to get their head handed to them because they're you know biased toward a political financial Wall Street centric model that promotes war and wealth inning and quality gaps well in the second half I have a whole bunch more data and we're gonna look at the fracking the cost of all those bonds there's junk bonds that we have financed it and also some more of the data of actually what reduce falling prices does to the existing grid that Bill Kristol loves and again I want to say listen to Bill Kristol he's your guy like the guy you know he listened to his like support of what US authorities say and what the facts and data might say do your own research exactly so let's get more and more and more into this after the break don't go away stay right there welcome back to the cars report on Max Keiser Stacy Herbert we are continuing our conversation about fracking energy data okay we're continuing our story about fracking and I must reiterate that Bill Kristol who used to be much maligned by the likes of MSNBC now as part of the resistance and the Democrats love him and embrace him so if you're a partisan patriotic American you must listen to what Bill Kristol says and bill kristol says that fracking any sort of negative thoughts you have about fracking are only planted there by the likes of Kaiser report not the facts not the data not the reality of the situation on the ground we're not even going to talk about any of the environmental or health consequences you can google that and do your own research but here is a story from CNBC from May 3rd 2018 just a few weeks ago oil demand and prices set to drop dramatically as new technologies take hold so they point out that fracking has made the u.s. the number one energy producer in the world at the moment but they say one major result of the adoption of this new technology and the dramatic drop in gas prices it has produced is the hollowing out of the US coal industry reduced from a thirty-five billion dollar industry in just 2011 to a three billion dollar industry in 2017 this has just wiped out the coal industry now the likes of Bill Kristol and Hamilton 68 will say that's probably a Russian operation that Putin destroy the coal industry and and rotten Trump did run on a campaign to basically get coal jobs back but what happened was fracking destroyed all those jobs in West Virginia in Kentucky it was fracking and natural gas prices which drove down the price of natural gas production for electricity that drove down the obliterated obliterated just destroyed by 90% the coal industry right and as you're going to get into here that substitution of gas for coal was propped up by some very dodgy finances and economics yes we're gonna get into that but I want to show what that same economics now so natural gas destroyed coal what is gonna destroy natural gas production right now it's natural gas and in order to get that natural gas and keep that natural gas prices low in America you've got to have a lot of fracking ok we're not going to go into their environmental health cost of that we're just gonna look at the actual data what's gonna happen to natural gas so using this dramatic shift as an example we can see the role cost please and driving the direction of the energy industry remember it's cost you know most businesses look at costs they don't look at geopolitics they don't look at like oh I'm a Republican or a Democrat and I have to show my partners in support and they're not gonna respond to rush controls on Twitter they're gonna look at their cost businesses look at their cost so consider now that solar energy which has become steadily more competitive as its scale has grown has gone from producing electric power at a hundred and seventy nine dollars per megawatt hour in 2009 to $50 per megawatt hour in 2017 which be huge another huge drop so that it's forecasted to continue to drop like that so once it becomes cheaper to provide electricity and now you have those lithium-ion batteries also providing giving electric power grids the ability to store this electricity cheaply where that hasn't been the case until just recently just this year it's gonna blitter rate the need for natural gas whatever you want to say if you want to blame it on Russian trolls that's gonna be the reason why it's happened but the fact is most businesses do not hang out all day on Twitter they just look at their balance sheet and their balance sheet is gonna say well how am I gonna compete with a solar plant Electric you know unless your power outfit right down the road that is able to provide the electricity at a fraction the cost compared to what I can write so so the frackers and the natural gas obliterated the coal industry it destroyed it it killed it it destroyed it nobody says that on the campaign trail nobody says that on MSNBC and they certainly won't say it Fox but that is what killed the coal industry and now solar and renewables are and gonna kill the fracking industry ironically to build crystal it was China that caused that to happen they're the ones that drove down this price because they pour billions of dollars into research they have the manufacturing capacity they drove down the cost of these photovoltaic cells so they're the ones that drove down the cost so hugely like 90 percent remember under the Obama administration Solar basically providers here in the United States where is seeking some government funds and subsidies in order to compete with China okay so there's there's China leading the way here so to go back to 2016 a few years before that politically speaking had the politics in Washington not been driven by the fossil fuel energy lobbyists they could have gone into renewables 10 20 years earlier and those jobs would be in place generating good-paying jobs that America would be part of a growing world beating industry but because they count out to those lobbyists they got stuck in the coal business which got obliterated by the gas business which is extremely dodgy and for a lot of reasons and now that's gonna be obliterated by Chinese led revolution in SolarEdge yes and win so here it comes you know it's not just China it's also Denmark and Sweden and you know Scandinavia other countries in Europe have have basically led the way on this at this rate solar energy has already undercut gas which costs $60 per megawatt hour so members $50 for solar coal is a hundred and two dollars per megawatt hour and nuclear energy is a hundred and forty eight dollars per megawatt hour and cost of course France has always their most expensive they always go through the most expensive they have the finest champagne the finest wine the finest cheese and the finest cost for electricity the finest atomic energy plants in Europe are in for love wrong they run on champagne they're cooled by shop so similar strides have been made in harnessing wind energy sources with onshore wind costing $40 per megawatt hour again below the cost of gas which is $60 and offshore wind sources in 2017 were priced at $60 again you know they lobbyists in the fossil fuel industry first the propaganda machine in America to scapegoat a foreign power to legitimize their ignorance and when it comes to generating good high-paying renewable energy jobs and it was obvious to everyone it was right in front of their face but they're so corrupt and so kleptocratic and such a kakastico see that they refused to acknowledge the facts before their face well building pipelines like you know the pipeline going to the Dakotas again that's a Russian troll operation that's what they say so if you want to listen to that listen to that and that's your prerogative to not do your own research and just be a patriot and listen to Bill Kristol but the fact is tar sands is what's coming through those Dakota pipelines it's coming from Canada which is all this stuff they mentioned that that's gonna be totally obliterated that's like why you're spending all this time and money for boondoggles that will be like by the time it's done being built all the costs all the economics have just like obliterated the case for that so I want to also turn to the cost so well the money pouring into this of course we have free money at the moment is 0% interest rates and that makes it like a little bit easier to just basically you know zero percent interest rates you have pension funds that need a yield at any cost because they have you know escalating costs as baby boomers retire so they're looking for any junk bonds they could buy boondoggles tend to be the junky as the ball so you're gonna go for a boondoggle right well first of all from Wall Street Journal December 2017 Wall Street tells frackers to stop counting barrels and start making profits the shale oil Revolution produces a lot of oil but not enough upside for investors 12 major shareholders in US shale oil and gas producers met this September in a midtown Manhattan high-rise with a view of Times Square to discuss a common goal getting those frackers to make money for a change now we have said this on Kaiser report for years that they lose money on every single barrel and again Bill Kristol says that is propaganda and that is not true here these twelve major shareholders have obviously fallen to Russian propaganda because they also believe that they're not making a profit they are obviously wrong if if if Bill Kristol is right these guys are wrong they are in fact making a profit they have been making a profit they're just not reading their ballot sheet correctly they cost us $200 to make that barrel but we only make you know fifty cents that must be a Russian BOTS must be attacking us down here in Texas that's what I heard because they're not making no money it's like The Beverly Hillbillies in Reverse it's like Bill Kristol is shooting at some crude and up through the ground come bubbling propaganda vial that is bias well the next thing you know Bill's a millionaire it said Washington is the place to go spew is toxic waste propaganda to and fro okay let's turn to some more articles about the bond wastage and money actually being thrown at the frakkers so how Wall Street enabled the fracking revolution that is losing billions the US shale industry hailed as a revolution has burned through a quarter of a trillion dollars more than it has brought in over the last decade it has been a money-losing endeavor of epic proportions even when it was at a hundred and ten dollars the cost has since they are becoming more efficient and they are able to produce at a cheaper price per barrel but still they're not making any product it takes more energy and then comes out and the average lifespan of a fracking field it doesn't last long enough to pay off the debt so it's a money loser that was obvious from day one so why does it keep on why do investors keep pouring money into well shale oil companies are creatures of the capital markets and 2017 legendary hedge fund manager Jim Chino is referred to shale oil companies as creatures of the capital markets meaning that without Wall Street money they would not exist Chanos is also on record as shorting the stock of heavily leveraged shale oil giant Continental Resources because the company can't even make enough money to pay interest on the loans so this is the Continental Resources by the way if you're a patriot who loves Hamilton 68 loves what US authorities say about this just being Russian propaganda you can go buy some bonds from Continental Resources you can buy their shares Harold Hamm lost a billion dollars he had to pay to his wife he only has eighteen billion dollars left he's the CEO he's increased his pay by 38% last year you can go support him by buying his shares buying a give me money no crystal can prove that he owns shares in these junk bonds he should just Sta that's nice but listen listen this is what Continental Resources one of the biggest players Herald him multi multi billionaire what how this company operates is a fracking company he pushes for legislation pro fracking he probably helps finance Hamilton 68 we don't know because nobody's allowed to know other than what Bill Kristol who is actually behind it well in 2017 Continental spent two hundred and ninety four million dollars on interest expenses which is approximately one hundred and fifty five percent of its 2017 adjusted net income generation we can't even pay the interest in your credit cards you are broke well you know the same thing is coming to the American economy as a whole I mean there's got twenty trillion dollars in on the books debt and the interest costs are rising exponentially and pretty soon it'll be just like a junk bond America is going to be Triple C rated Wall Street has been Jay P Morgan by the way is the biggest underwriter of these junk bonds to the fracking industry but a question to ask is who who are they you know who's the who's paying for it you know obviously the fracking industry is receiving the money from these bonds JP Morgan's not giving them the money at somebody else and it's most likely your pension fund so if you're a patriot who loves Bill Kristol don't worry like you're already invested in these fracking industries and hopefully you know the fact that Saudi Arabia is now building a two hundred gigawatt two hundred billion dollar solar farm the biggest in the world well you know maybe they know a little bit more about the oil industry than Bill Kristol and that's gonna do it for this edition of the kaisers report with me Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert if you want to catch us on Twitter it's Kaiser report if you want to catch this on telegram it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
