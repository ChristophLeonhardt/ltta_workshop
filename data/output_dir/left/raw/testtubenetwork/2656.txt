1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,959
Political leaders around the world have the
power to change the lives of millions of people

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,660
with the stroke of a pen.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,570
This year, world leaders from Syria to South
Sudan have made decision that have resulted

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,400
in war, famine and political oppression that
will be recording in history for years.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,900
And this got us thinking, which world leaders
should we keep an eye on in 2018?

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,910
First on our list is North Korean dictator
Kim Jong-Un.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,430
In his early thirties, Kim is one of the youngest
leaders in the world and has made a name for

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,470
himself as one of the most volatile leaders
in the last few years.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,900
Oh yeah, not to mention he also controls a
massive nuclear weapons arsenal and the fourth

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,020
largest army in the world.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,750
When he gained power in 2011, many experts
thought Kim wouldn’t be able to hold onto

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,220
power because of his inexperience.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,590
But years later, he’s proven himself as
a ruthless leader who’s willing to execute

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,490
high ranking officials and even family members
who have questioned his authority.

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,790
Under his leadership, North Korea has entered
into a new era in its nuclear weapons ambitions

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,670
-- with at least 89 confirmed missiles tests
since his rule began.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,160
That’s more tests than his father, Kim Jong-Il,
and grandfather, Kim-il Sung, combined.

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,970
2017 was undoubtedly a huge year for the North
Korean leader, having tested over 20 missiles,

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,460
including its very first ICBM, or Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile, which it claims can reach

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,420
the mainland United States.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,000
Earlier in that year, he was also accused
of ordering the murder of his defecting half-brother

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,550
with a chemical agent in an attack straight
out a spy novel.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,940
Kim Jong-Un has undoubtedly proven himself
as an unpredictable and brutal leader in 2017,

24
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,460
and is definitely someone you should pay attention
to in 2018.

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,770
Next on our list is a man who hasn’t even
gained full power yet, but has surely made

26
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,840
power moves that have had severe domestic
and regional implications.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,260
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi
Arabia escalated in power, becoming the next

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,050
heir to the Saudi Monarchy, in only June 2017.

29
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,860
His drastic promotion was an unexpected move
by the King who ousted the former heir to

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,760
the crown, Salman’s cousin, Mohammed bin
Nayef.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,710
The 32-year-old Crown Prince is also the nation’s
Deputy Prime Minister and defence minister.

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,460
During his time as defence minister, the nation
has seen an uptick in military actions.

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,700
He is responsible for the largest military
conflict in all of Saudi Arabian history,

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,280
its brutal and often indiscriminate bombing
campaign and blockade of Yemen, its poor neighbor

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,740
to the south.

36
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,570
The Prince is also seen as central figure
in the series of shocking arrests of other

37
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,510
princes and prominent figures in the country
in November 2017.

38
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,860
The Crown Prince claims the arrests were in
a part of his supposed “anti-corruption”

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,040
campaign in the kingdom, but some see the
move as the latest example of him consolidating

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,230
power.

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,980
The young prince is also seen by some as a
force for modernization in the historically

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,459
conservative country.

43
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,670
He is seen as the mastermind behind the kingdom’s
ambitious Vision 2030 plan that hopes to diversify

44
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,590
its economy, shifting it away from so dependent
on oil-exportations.

45
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,190
The prince’s desire for modernizing his
economy, seems to be at the center of his

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,270
recent social reforms, like the reversal of
the ban on women driving, its plan to issue

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,760
tourist visas for the first time in 2018,
and even allowing cinemas to reopen for the

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,380
the first time since the 1970s.

49
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,810
If the 2017 is any indication of what we should
expect from Mohammad bin Salam, he is certainly

50
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,860
a leader you should keep an eye on in 2018.

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,620
And last, but certainly not least on our list
is Russian President Vladimir Putin.

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,530
Putin has always been a rather controversial
figure, but over the past few years he’s

53
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,430
escalated conflict in the region, cracked
down on political opposition, and has even

54
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,130
been accused of directing the hacking of the
2016 US presidential elections.

55
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,820
Most notable of his actions, has been the
2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

56
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,730
IT fueled a war between russian-backed separatist
and the Ukrainian government in the nation’s

57
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,730
east.

58
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,680
Tensions don’t seem to be subsiding anytime
soon either.

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,290
Fighting in eastern Ukraine has killed over
10,000 since it started in 2014 and has recently

60
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,740
seen an uptick in clashes throughout the region.

61
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,510
And while this might all sound like old news,
it’s important to remember the actions by

62
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,780
Putin as we look as his goals for 2018 -- becoming
president again.

63
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,269
Although he hesitated to announce his candidacy
down to the last minute, no one ever questioned

64
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,310
Putin’s intentions of whether he wanted
to stay in power for another 6 years.

65
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,370
With the election being held on the anniversary
of the annexation of Crimea, the lack of legitimate

66
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,040
opposition candidates, and his popularity
in Russia, it projected that Putin will almost

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,180
certainly win the Presidency again come March
-- a move that will keep him in power till

68
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,610
2024.

69
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,441
As you can tell from this video, one of the
most dangerous ways world leaders tend to

70
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:18,639
wield their influence is by entering into
conflict and wars.

71
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,889
But what were some of the most devastating,
significant, and underreported conflicts of

72
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:23,889
2017?
