the left is losing their minds after yesterday's White House press briefing I'm gonna explain during yesterday's White House press briefing a question was asked about the president's meeting with Senator Rand Paul as to whether or not Obama's CIA chief John Brennan's security clearance should be pulled and the way Sarah Huckabee Sanders the press secretary answered the question through the left into a frenzy he said well I'll paraphrase Sarah he's not only looking at revoking Brennan's clearance he's also looking at pulling commis flappers McCabe's Hayden's and Susan Rice's all Obama or Bush people all never Trump errs out there insulting this president night and day well the left went nuts the press corps win nuts you can't do that you can't pull these security clearances they're entitled of these clearances that's punishment it's at they're not dirty clearance the privilege if you're leaking to the media if you're using that clearance to gain background information then spinning it to improperly and incorrectly smear the sitting president because you're upset that Hillary Clinton lost well then you're not entitled to that clearance now the dumbest the dumbest correspondents on this I saw was from Jennifer Rubin that alleged fake conservative over at the Washington Post who wrote this nonsensical diatribe about clearances being First Amendment protected and how by losing their clearances these people would have their First Amendment rights infringed upon well you know it seems to me I don't know I don't know sure it seems to me like Jennifer Rubin is losing some of her sources look you are not guaranteed a security clearance okay they are reviewed all the time I saw other leftists on social media saying knows people or have clearances for a life there's no such thing active duty agents soldiers intelligence operatives have their clearances reviewed top-secret SDI is every five years even more often if you're sensitive s CI there's no clearance for life you're not guaranteed a clear you have security clearance and you take a credit hit you go over do it alone they might pull your clearance until you clear it up there's no guarantee of a security clearance John Brennan's not guaranteed a security clearance when he's out there every day engaging in sedition and subversion against the president the United States Andrew McCabe shouldn't even have a clearance he was fired from the FBI and he's under criminal referral to the Department of Justice by their own inspector general it's ludicrous that even has a clearance no Trump should pull these security clearances and the left be damned it is long overdue to start playing their games knowing who the enemies are and taking every step to cripple them because this is not just political discourse John Brennan is not engaging and only First Amendment protected discourse he's going out there and is the former director of the CIA implying that he knows about crimes committed by the President of the United States that nonsense is is indefensible and it's false and he's using his security clearance and his former title for Authority and credibility and it's a very dangerous thing it's very bad for America well I hope that wasn't just a bluff I hope that wasn't just well a political threat by the president I hope he is seriously reviewing and ultimately pulls the security clearances of John Brennan James Comey James clapper Andrew McCabe Michael Hayden and Susan Rice and I hope he pulls even more because they're not the only leakers and the only ones using their former positions and clearances against this administration and actually against the United States of America this important subject matter I wanna bring it to you every day help me do that subscribe to our premium service www that the rebel dot media forward slash shows also every morning 7:30 Eastern Time on the rebels YouTube channel check out my new show Declassified live thanks for watching I'll see you tomorrow
