TO DATE. A BLAST THREE TIMES LARGER DROPPED ON JAPAN TO END WORLD WAR II. THANK YOU. WE HAVE WITH US NOW, DANIEL DAVIS A FORMER ADVISER TO THE SOUTH KOREAN ARMY. HOW DO THIS THIS POWER ISSUE? IN TERMS OF THIS SUSPICIOUS OF THE MILITARY DRILLS, I DON'T VIEW THAT AS A CONCESSION. IT'S A CALCULATED RISK BY THE PRESIDENT. IT COSTS US NOTHING TO DO. IT DOESN'T DIMINISH OUR MILITARY CAPABILITY OR READINESS IN THE SHORT TERM. THERE'S NOTHING THAT WILL STOP OUR FORCES FROM TRAINING AS YOUR CORRESPONDENT JUST SAID. BUT IT COULD LAY THE PATH FOR LOWERING THE TENSIONS CONTINUALLY AND MOVING TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION. COULD BE A GOOD PLAY BY THE PRESIDENT. THERE'S A SAYING IN AMERICA, IF YOU WANT PEACE, PREPARE FOR WAR. SO TO PUT A FINER POINT ON THIS, THE BBC HAD A REPORT THIS IS A TWEET. CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY ANNOUNCED THAT TRUMP WOULD SUSPEND U.S. WAR GAMES WITH SOUTH KOREA BEFORE TRUMP ANNOUNCED IT HIMSELF AT THE PRESS BRIEFING THAT SUGGESTED KIM'S PEOPLE WERE ON THE PHONE TO BEIJING AFTER THE MEETING BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE HOW BIG A CONCESSION IT WAS. THAT'S INTERESTING FOR ME. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON I'VE HEARD EXPLAIN THAT IT'S NOT AS BIG A CONCESSION THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WORRY. IT'S NOT. THE REASON I SAY THAT, OUR STRATEGIC CAPABILITIES AND OUR TACTICAL CAPABILITIES ARE UNCHAFFED. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WELL AWARE OF THAT. ANYTHING SUSPENDED CAN BE UNSUSPENDED IN A DAY. OUR AIR FORCE IS POWERFUL, THE PACIFIC FLEET IS CAPABLE OF DOING THINGS EVERYWHERE. WE HAVE GIVEN UP NOTHING. BUT IF IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION, THAT IS A REALLY GOOD PLAY. TELL ME ABOUT CYBER WARFARE. I KNOW THE NORTH KOREANS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN VERY ADEPT AND CAUSING LOTS OF PROBLEMS AROUND THE WORLD. THE CYBER WARFARE ISSUE AND OUR PREPAREDNESS IN THAT AREA. THAT IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE FOR US TO TAKE CARE OF. YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT MILITARY. IF YOU'RE NOT PROTECTED FROM CYBER INTRUSION, IT CAN LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN ANY REALM. WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT. OUR COUNTER MEASURES ARE IMPROVING AND CONSTANTLY EVOLVING. SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PUT AN EMPHASIS ON. I FEEL CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NORTH KOREAN MILITARY IS THINKING NOW ACTION THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY WORKING FOR SOMEBODY THAT IS A DICTATOR AND TREATED THE CITIZENS TERRIBLY BUT THEY'RE EXTREMELY LOYAL TO HIM. ARE THERE ANY CRACKS IN THE ARMOR WITH HIS MILITARY? I DON'T THINK WE SEE ANY CRACKS IN THE ARMOR, NOT ON ANY LARGE SCALE UP TO THIS POINT. THIS SACKING OF THE THREE SENIOR GENERALS COULD BE AN INDICATION OF THAT DEPENDING WHAT THE INSIDE REASON FOR ALL OF IT WAS. WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF REPORTING THAT THE MILITARY HAS BEEN PRIORITIZED AND THE RESOURCES THEY'VE GOT TEN FOR DECADES NOW HAS NOT BEEN AS FED AS WELL AS WE HOPED, AS WELL AS THEY WANTED. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOWER TENSIONS, THAT WILL MAKE THEM HAPPY. I HAVE ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT WITH YOU. SINCE 1955 AFTER THE KOREAN WAR, YOU KNOW, IT STARTED THAT CURRENTLY WE HAVE 23,000 FORCES IN SOUTH KOREA. I WONDER IF YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PEOPLE, THE AMERICANS THAT HAVE SERVED IN THAT AREA SINCE 1955? YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE WERE PLACED THERE WHEN SOUTH KOREA COULDN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES. THEY RELIED ON US. I SERVED IN THE 90s. EVERYBODY HAS BEEN THERE IS PART OF DEFENDING OUR TREASURED ALLY IN SOUTH KOREA. THEY CAN BE PROUD OF WHAT IS COMING IN NOW. IF WE CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED, IT WOULD BE A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT. EVERYBODY WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY
