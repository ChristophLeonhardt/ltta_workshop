dear Lord Clavin my brother and I used to be very close but he has not spoken with me or several other family members since the election he took great offense to a YouTube video that I shared and he labeled me a racist and unaware of my white privilege he tried to shame me rather than have a conversation I never complained about his left-wing causes emails and forwards over the years but the tolerance is not reciprocated he has such strong hatred for Trump and anything he touches and he has stated I'm done should I take him at his word or how might I reach out to him do I have or wick to wait for a Democrat to take the presidency before I can talk to my brother again I have this in my own life Jonathan it's it is really weird to me that I for eight years Obama they just don't understand they do not see themselves that Obama was just as offensive to me as Trump is to them in so many ways I never started I would argue with them about it but I never stopped talking to anybody I never cursed anybody I never say and yet they feel it's just fine to just write you out of their life like that it is an amazing act of sanctimony and self unawareness that word I have know that where there is no word for cluelessness about oneself and the only thing that you can do is you know you can write one email one email to your brother and say look this is the way I feel about this I never did this to you I'm sorry you do this to me I'm always here for you I love you but I'm not gonna reach out to you and be insulted contact me when you calm down that's the only thing I think you can do and then you have to live with that you have to live with that I mean you have to live with when you say goodbye to somebody they might not come back you got to live with it like I said I have this in my own life I've had to do this with people I'm here for them if they want to come back and talk but at the same time I just think I cannot break through the sanctimonious idea that somehow by disagreeing with them politically you are committing an atrocity that means they should write you out of your life it's ridiculous
