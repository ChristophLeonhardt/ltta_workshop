00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so it's been a while but</font>

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,939
I'm back in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bookshelf</font>

3
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,890
right here to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some books well</font>

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,080
one book<font color="#CCCCCC"> in particular Bruce procera</font>

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">Skelton you may remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i reviewed</font>

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,650
high and dry by stereo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Skelton before in</font>

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">this channel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that here if</font>

8
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,559
you haven't seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll also put it in</font>

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,030
the description bar below bruised was

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,440
actually published before high and dry

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,880
has quite different character different

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,740
voices it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really different story</font>

13
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,660
anything in common i would say is that

14
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,400
it's in high school while I would say

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,080
that high<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dry is personally I think</font>

16
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a story but a book better writing</font>

17
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,039
there was so much to be found<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,470
bruised and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

19
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,050
myself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay quick spoiler-free plot</font>

20
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,899
Imogen is an expert at taekwondo or at

21
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what you'd probably think</font>

22
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,989
being an outsider she's a black belt but

23
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,940
she explains that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> meter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

24
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of your journey not that</font>

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,850
you're at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it she teaches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

26
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,739
her local martial arts center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and her</font>

27
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,079
older brother hunter is quite sought

28
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,610
after in the high school it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

29
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,110
fairly safe to say that there's four

30
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,879
straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> Imogen to no end so then</font>

31
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,289
there's the big event that changes

32
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,210
everything Imogen is that a diner one

33
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,280
evening when a gunman walks in that is

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,300
all I'm going to say about the plot

35
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,969
other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know chaumet occurs I</font>

36
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember that over at two nights</font>

37
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,820
down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I wanted to mention</font>

38
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,950
in this review<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's let's go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

39
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,170
notes the first one is confronting

40
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,360
illness and the second one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

41
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
realness<font color="#CCCCCC"> cama trying to break through I</font>

42
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,140
don't know exactly how you saw those

43
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,310
things are going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our discussion</font>

44
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,110
today but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say that not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

45
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,520
image and have to turn in and look at

46
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">how she's affected by this event she</font>

47
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,170
also has to look at how she has prior to

48
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,390
the event observed the people around her

49
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,640
father Matt how she acts how she speaks

50
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,200
to them how she treats them in a lot of

51
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think it really starts at her</font>

52
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,600
regarding them how she immediately I

53
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,790
guess processes them in her brain her

54
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,070
assumptions about them her tendency to

55
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,810
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> things as black and white which ends</font>

56
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,790
up hurting herself more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than anyone else</font>

57
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,049
and that for me is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the biggest</font>

58
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,670
strengths and themes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this book yes</font>

59
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,229
you have elements of like the high

60
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,750
school genre and kids just like judging

61
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,759
each other and being kids and whatever

62
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is judging yourself</font>

63
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,110
and the standards you hold yourself to

64
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,939
also when you think you're being honest

65
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,290
to yourself that you're actually being

66
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,909
cruel to yourself but there is also a

67
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,439
really strong theme of how you see your

68
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,790
parents and how you see

69
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,680
when they grow and how you see them when

70
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,570
they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just become</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to you</font>

71
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,039
image and<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some interactions with her</font>

72
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,750
dad that really like Coach me in the

73
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,950
throat and made me think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

74
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,660
interactions with my dad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that feeling</font>

75
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,310
which I guess now I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned is pretty</font>

76
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,200
common among teenagers when you feel

77
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,670
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can communicate to your parents</font>

78
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you can really kick to your parents</font>

79
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,190
you communicate to your parents so then

80
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you just don't speak the</font>

81
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,730
same language anymore you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can't get</font>

82
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,350
through you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't understand that</font>

83
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">choices and they can't understand your</font>

84
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,900
choices and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a cliche again it's a</font>

85
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,550
cliche because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it because</font>

86
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,740
we feel it and we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

87
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,660
look back and recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

88
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,900
ourselves but it also it being a cliche

89
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,970
sometimes you don't you can't like walk

90
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,709
through that exact feeling there's a

91
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,600
good analogy for that which also doesn't

92
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,370
just serve as an analogy for those of

93
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,330
you who have read it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're watching</font>

94
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,680
back a thing what the hell is she

95
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say it's do with</font>

96
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability there are love story romance</font>

97
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,020
elements and that time do you think oh I

98
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,580
know how this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end why didn't</font>

99
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do I think you are under estimating</font>

100
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,080
how you kind of made to underestimate

101
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,110
her as in the writer as in the character

102
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,090
as in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people around her and also as</font>

103
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,670
in the severity of the situation just

104
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,890
how traumatic the trauma has been for

105
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,480
her it also really makes you think about

106
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,550
how when reading stories we assume that

107
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people experience a single</font>

108
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,880
trauma in the same way when<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

109
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,780
they have loads of different reactions

110
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it which again you know some level</font>

111
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,280
but it's until that sort of teased out

112
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you while you reading the experience</font>

113
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,500
of this book that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably</font>

114
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,090
understand it and so the second thing

115
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the realness trying to get through</font>

116
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">and trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the thing that</font>

117
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,180
hurts and that's tied into the trauma

118
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,860
and trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and reach it and</font>

119
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,140
yet not managing to break through and

120
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,390
that question of can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever break</font>

121
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,120
through can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever feel as much as you</font>

122
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,370
want to feel can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

123
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,830
feeling in the intense way that you

124
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,410
wanted we<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that search for</font>

125
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,640
intensity<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different places</font>

126
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">in our lives and doesn't always have to</font>

127
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,880
come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a traumatic moment but I think</font>

128
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skilton did a wonderful job</font>

129
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,170
of someone who was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to that</font>

130
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,090
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to the real you in a lot</font>

131
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of ways because that's sometimes the</font>

132
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,690
scariest thing you don't feel like an

133
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,220
established person you don't feel like

134
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,930
you're connected to yourself especially

135
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this is a cute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people who</font>

136
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience depression this is all so</font>

137
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,150
cute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and teenagers happens to all of us</font>

138
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,940
and it will good

139
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,870
to happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of us because</font>

140
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,839
consciousness and all that stuff is so

141
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,690
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasting and because you can't be in</font>

142
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,920
someone else's brain because you can't

143
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,330
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience that anyone else</font>

144
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,040
has you're having to prove to yourself

145
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,230
that you exist you're having to have

146
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,300
those moments like the bell jar that are

147
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,060
I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am I am anyway so I thought this</font>

148
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a great way a novel and I look</font>

149
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,150
forward to more of Sarah skeletons work

150
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,980
as she continues writing as i hopes you

151
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,510
will so quickly to run you through the

152
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,430
plan for the rest of the whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>
