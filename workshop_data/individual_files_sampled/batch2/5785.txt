while I was looking at your finances your family's finances unrelated to Russia is that a red line would that be a breach of what is actual or something so you know sell a lot of kind of units somebody somebody from Russia by some kind of overdose well good morning and welcome to am joy so how you been doing good well I for one have been on vacation and clearly a lot has happened since I last sat in this chair low three weeks ago we have Omarosa spilling all the tea on Donald Trump in her new book and we're gonna have more on that when she joins our show in the next hour Trump's former campaign chief has now convicted felon and then of course Trump's former fixer and personal attorney the man who has made messy things like potentially chatty mistresses go away for his client pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws and implicated the president in his crimes but the biggest blow for Trump happened in just the last 24 hours when we learned that a third person intimately familiar with his secrets is cooperating with the feds Allen weiselberger the longtime CFO of the Trump Organization that a trump confidant for decades was granted immunity for his cooperation in the Cohen case his cooperation could be just one of the many significant threats facing not just Trump's presidency but his business but Trump once said would be a red line that Muller shouldn't cross and joining me now is Maya Wiley senior vice president for social justice at the new school MSNBC legal analyst Paul Butler le mis style editor of above the law comm and Dean Obeidallah Sirius XM host of the eponymous Dean Obeidallah show I gotta say eponymous I have to say $17 words on television in three weeks now all right let's talk about all of these threats facing the president gonna start with Tony Schwartz who Paul tweeted on Friday the other shoe has dropped The Smoking Gun equivalent to Nixon's tapes Allen weiselberger knows everything Trump will resign as I've always assumed only a matter of now your thoughts is this is catastrophic for Trump as Tony Schwartz things in it Trump is in big trouble so we can talk about prosecutorial strategy or we can talk about mother with because my mother used to say you're gonna find out who your real friends are when you're in trouble yeah and it turns out the president doesn't have any field staffers he's got fixers he got employees what would push comes to shove they stand up and flip yeah and he doesn't have a dog which is Washington is the only real friend I mean bring in the comedy I'm gonna go to you cuz you wrote a piece called going after family you mentioned Eric on your blog you said Island weiselberger mmunity deal shows prosecutors are going after the family not the business if you don't need you'll need alan Weissenberg to get cohen colin is a foppish clown and was going down anyway you need alan Wessel burg if you're going after his family i think that's what we're seeing here that's the next pressure point for Trump now we know that trumps as a father Trump is more like your mama's boy creepy boyfriend than he is like your real daddy like we don't know that he s the parental instincts right of a regular person yeah but you know Trump seems to think that he's above the law but most mammals will sacrifice themselves to protect their children and I think what the prosecutor computers are about to find out is whether or not Trump is above the laws of nature yeah I mean the perception was that Michael Flynn right in part you know he makes this deal his son maybe was protected by him doing that well I mean it doesn't always work that way because we do have a certain congressman who's throwing his wife like all the way under the bus as he goes down but but you know that is sort of the red line that Donald Trump had set up before don't go after my businesses theoretically maybe that extends to his children who run his businesses well he did say that going after his family would cross a line for the Moller investigation so he has said that I think the issue here actually goes back to what are his legal vulnerabilities versus what are his political vulnerability because on the legal side let's be honest it is going to be a very Muller has been moving at the speed of light yeah the speed with which he has gotten a number of plea deals and and now convictions is really astounding for the legal process it is very very very difficult whether whether we're looking the New York State AG which is looking now into the Trump foundation that's where whistle burgers also very important that also could directly implicate the kids Trump does not have pardon power there yep but that it takes time and so in the context of a political cycle the question is do you get enough explicit evidence in addition to what you've gotten from Michael Cohen because right now it's an it's an it's a Cohen allegation right with some evidence behind it as we know from the tape which i think is quite damning for Trump but politically he has survived having a literally having a university where he had to settle a twenty five million dollar lawsuit there for fraud for defrauding students we already knew he had the tape the Access Hollywood take where he literally admitted to sexual assault of women these are crimes or not so it's not like he hasn't survived politically right a lot of allegations that have been potentially criminal yep and we are in a process where I absolutely believe that we're going to see a lot more criminal allegations yeah and evidence of crime I think the issue is the political cycle with win it with in which it happens and the degree to which the Republicans because like this is where we're an uncharted territory the type of allegations that we have about the president should have already sunk him politically yeah in any normal sphere of politics in this country yet the party of the president would say you got to go yeah and that's not happening to you I mean you hear on the radio every day so you're talking to people personally you get some Trump people who call me I mean what Donald Trump is exposed if anything is the degree to which the Republican Party is not really a policy driven entity at from the base up it is a personality cult around Donald Trump and literally there's nothing he could do to lose that that personality cult that's true but on the other side is the Trump residence is gonna make an amazing crime mini-series on Netflix so we've got that going for us yeah the realities they call up when they Trump supporters call and even though I'm on the progressive Channel they will mimic and pair it with a here on Fox News so indefinitely goes to what about Hillary's emails because I'm Fox News Hillary's president which is kind of remarkable sexy a good thing but so there's nothing but let's not lose sight of one thing they are getting delivered something they want they're getting Kavanagh perhaps they got Gorsuch they're getting right-wing laws they're trying to usher in Christian Sharia law which I know drives people on the right crazy but that's true they want to turn the Bible into American law not all of them some of them so they're getting delivery things it's not like this cult Trump's the greatest guy just because he has orange hair and we like him it he's rude and he's a bigot he is delivering on the promises they feel so passionate about so he does not care about his agenda he does not care about conservatives all he cares about is keeping himself out of prison or not being impeached because again since the sessions is the most effective cabinet member in terms of carrying out the agenda you would think he would be loving him but he's trying to get him to go away again that's obstruction of justice and he's getting Lindsey Graham who once said there's no way you're getting rid of sessions to say you know maybe get rid of him do whatever you want that Lindsey Graham is a witness or Astley who's yet a longtime friend absolutely everyone over the side so let's go back for just one second and compartmentalize the legal jeopardy that potentially Donald Trump could be in set aside the fact that there is nothing politically gonna happen to him because his base doesn't care what he does and the Republican Party there was my favorite tweet this week was the idea of Paul Ryan practicing shrugging in front of a mirror so but legally right what could happen to him right now Trump is using the power of the presidency as like a Klingon cloaking device for his crimes okay he can do that as long as he's president but if you've looked at the statute of limitations once he's no longer precedent I was looking at it the statute of limitations for campaign finance fraud is violations or six years tax fraud is sorry or five years tax frauds usually six years that takes us well into 2021 if any he remembers when Obama was coming up people were saying to Obama you have to prosecute bush and vania Obama we're not here to talk about the past I don't think that's gonna work in 2020 I think you're a Democratic candidate in 2020 you have to be willing to say that you are going to prosecute cops out of office and when he's out of office if he's out of office in 2021 all of these crimes there's a reason why he hasn't been charged yet yeah the statute of limitations is tolling based on the when the crime started which as far as we can tell it's 2016 2017 that's gonna still be there for a chargeable offense in 2021 we no longer has this poking device around him and so I would kind of put my if we're not gonna have a political solution yeah because Mitch McConnell pretends like you can't see right then the legal solution might be coming and not only that but a lot of these these crimes you know alleged crimes took place in the state of New York where basically every state official wants to be President of the United States right where the smart play is all prosecute them you read my mind just we did that thing we did yes because I think that's absolutely true on the federal level but this is the point about the New York State AG or the New York District Attorney yep number one those are that we have an election right now for New York State AG we already have an interim who has gone after civilly after the Trump Foundation as well as the tax department now looking into the tax fraud potential tax fraud crimes by the Trump foundation yep this this and the AG's I mean and the extract attorney as I said see the the cloak of the presidency which is essentially the Department of Justice memorandum that says which legal scholars debate that the president cannot be indicted while sitting in office which hasn't been tested it has not been tested and actually I would actually agree with the legal scholars that say says who says Rosenstein because it's his car he's actively going against the home department so I want to put a my federal prosecutor hat and make her claim federal prosecutors could be cold blooded they will go after your family and so we know now what's the endgame of this Southern District of New York federal investigation they were referred mother referred the investigation to this other district for Michael : well on Tuesday Michael Cohen became a convicted felon eight times over but they're still trying to use other people so what what what are they that's the question that I have is it is to what end because this cannot all be about campaign finance violations being the end game of proving Donald Trump violated campaign finance laws there has to be a bigger end game to all of these deals jr. it's called Kushner it's called Ivanka because that will give a prosecutor leverage over the president a deal could be made don't reside don't run for re-election and will leave the kids alone I wrote for The Daily Beast this week about the idea of potentially charging Donald Trump and the exception of DOJ regulations extraordinary circumstances this is a crime about how the men got elected to the rifle election fraud right and even attorney-client privilege if there's a fraud exception I think it's very powerful argument to say even though the DOJ sees as general principle that you cannot indict a sitting president extraordinary circumstances can be present in this case they are theirs the only reason the guy is in office yep so on some level he's an illegitimate president and I think that to have him sit in office for two years or six years while the cloud of criminality of how he got to this very office is there jury in terms of Kavanagh while he puts a Supreme Court justice on who could immunize them I think that is a question we have to go back to because if in fact there were the significance of the Cohen flip right is that he's admitting that he participated in a crime that was specifically about getting Trump elected about preventing him not being elected right then doesn't Donald Trump then get right out and you can't then say if he can't be prosecuted for a crime they put him in office the Constitution says I don't care the Constitution does not care about this argument I care we care but constitutionally speaking and I've said this before you indictment doesn't get you where you want to go because you can indict him you can convict him he can go to jail and he'll still be present he would be present arisen the only constitutional way to remove a sitting president is the impeachment clause or the 25th amendment conserved out the rest of this German jail chump Kapoor justice because the forethought fathers and for the record they weren't my forefathers I don't think that they thought that Congress would be so partisan that they would allow a member of their own party who was a thug to remain in office what he'd be like who is this Mitch McConnell guy thing that the Senate originally in our Constitution was not elected by the people it was chosen by the state representatives so there was no idea that a senate would be this hyper partisan they expected the Senators to be above this to be language-like judges so if they would see the evidence they would go like of course this person because the trial goes as we know in the Senate in the Senate and also not only that but then when they were appointed there were no political consequences of making let's not forget these are political actors and so people like Mitch McConnell go well if I go home to Kentucky having voted to convict a Republican president who's giving the base white Christian you know conservatives everything they want will then back the end of his political career so that wasn't present when the Senate was first constructed yeah and I did one point about the Senate and Chris Hayes has been making this point really importantly if you look at the spread of population of the country the Senate actually doesn't represent the population like 30 percent of the gun it's like 30 percent of the country you know Los Angeles County is actually as much of the population is about with some huge number of states so so we don't actually have a Senate that is politically representing a constituency that represents the country and that that is important for this political calculus right now why we're all going why are we not seeing it's different the ultimate minority rule and so does that mean that effectively we have a president who is in effect if not statutorily above the law well yeah so so this is what I just want to make sure we don't forget one important principle that even while because I actually believe that constitutionally the Justice Department is wrong in terms of its memorandum so I want to be on record as saying that at the same time I think it is important to recognize that we have seen a political polarization of law enforcement at times and part of why that memorandum exists is that we don't want a system in which the Department of Justice and the FBI essentially ends up becoming a shadow government sir and that's important I think the important thing here is that we have so much evidence yeah just what's in the public sphere of Donald Trump saying while I'm sworn to uphold the laws in the Constitution of the land I am simply not going to do it and I'm going to take the position that I don't have to do it I'm going to take the position that I could take over the mulher investigation he said that publicly I'm going to take the position that people should be legally barred from cooperating with law enforcement when they have evidence that someone has committed a crime right if it protects me I'm gonna take the position that the US Attorney General who's supposed to be the highest lawyer for the land yeah at the White House should be loyal only to me and therefore even as Paul said earlier even as I'm carrying out the policy mission of the administration and the only line session is drawing because he's made unconstitutional arguments in court the on Muslim ban for example yeah the only line he's drawn is I won't actually just go out there and violate the law yeah that's the that's the only our friend Montana masky has a book called if you can keep it referring to a republic if you can keep it I think we are at the point now we have a debate whether we have a president who is essentially the monarch and the DOJ memo talks about the rationale is that it's too much of distraction of the present or can hamper the president Oakland had a five week trial government function second they'd say potentially it's a spectacle Chief Justice Rehnquist wore a robe with gold on that he made himself base and I go bring some respect I'm giving a last word because everything we're gonna go does it's almost rump serve at his full term yeah I think he wins in 2020 but I think I think I think I think our country is in for is in a very we're in a bad state all right well bet on that frightening now unless you like Donald Trump in which case it's a glorious note now Maya and follow who joins us later in the show le mythology
