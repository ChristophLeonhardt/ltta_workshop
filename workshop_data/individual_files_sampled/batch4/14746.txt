to err is human to forgive divine but if someone is seeking forgiveness surely a sincere apology is in order yeah I'm talking to you louis c.k louis c.k is just the latest celebrity caught behaving in a sexually deviant way I got to be honest I'm starting to lose count right now it started with super producer Frank and Weinstein and so far hardly a day has gone by in which yet another a listener hasn't been outed so in a way it's really not that shocking that louis c.k has joined the perv parade list the indiscretion he's accused of is that he fondled himself south of the Equator while in the presence of female colleagues the latest accuser to come forward is Rebecca quarry I was walking to set to shoot my scene and he approached me and got really close to my face and said can I ask you something and I said yes and he said can I masturbate in front of you in your dressing room as an aside what the hell is in the heads of these guys I just be wit too embarrassed to force myself on someone but pulling the goalie and going solo in the presence of others yeah that's mortifying to me but while louis c.k is just the latest do-rag or celebrity sex creep it's his so-called apology that makes one raise a spa key and eyebrow check out the original apology served up by Louis which starts off as what appears to be an admiral admission of guilt before taking a sharp left turn into really unfunny land quote these stories are true at the time I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first which is also true but what I learned later in life too late is that when you have power over another person asking them to look at your dick isn't a question it's a predicament for them in quote okay he's a comedian that likes to take risk I totally get that but how does that saying go again too soon which is to say if you're apologizing for inappropriate sexual behavior don't pepper your apology with reference - your wedding tackle and also where is the I'm sorry part of the apology bottom line you have to wonder what the deal is with louis c.k does he lack the class to utter a sincere apology was he consoled by lawyers or is he just a void of empathy or maybe he simply doesn't give a rodents rectum but in apparently trying to make a joke out of something that is really really unfunny louis c.k is doing something that all comedians hope never to do he's bombing big time for the rebel dot media i'm david the men's i'd mensies hey folks the rebel has an all-new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
