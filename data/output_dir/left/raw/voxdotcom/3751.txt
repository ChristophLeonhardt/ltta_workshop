1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,499
Republicans are having a real bad time defending
their health care bill.

2
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:07,140
… and now these people don’t have the
insurance they need ’cause they’re poor.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,800
It’s expected to cause about 20 million
Americans to lose health insurance over the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,320
next few years, and people are pissed.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,740
The fight and the fury mounting over the House
health care bill.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,289
Blowback for Republican Congress members who
voted to repeal and replace Obamacare.

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,460
It’s gotten so bad that Republicans have
just stopped talking to their constituents

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,460
altogether.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,050
Will we see you tomorrow night at the town
hall in Austin?

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,140
I don’t think so.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,500
Like Darrell Issa, who decided to just hide
out on the roof of his office instead of facing

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
his voters.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,870
Hello darkness, my old friend.

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,820
Thankfully, we have cable news to hold politicians
accountable.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,440
To ask the tough questions and explain what’s
really at stake in the debate over health

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
care.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,410
Take me inside the Oval Office, what was President
Trump’s sales pitch to you?

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,450
Has President Trump convinced you to get on
board?

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,260
Are you going to the White House tonight or
maybe bowling next week?

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,670
Has the president contacted you?

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,940
Trump is in a full court sales pitch.

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:07,510
Do you see any scenario where you will be
a buyer?

23
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,510
God da—

24
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,350
Cable news tries to make big congressional
votes more exciting by treating them like

25
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,420
an episode of House of Cards.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,240
By focusing on the drama of getting a bill
through Congress.

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,180
The negotiating, the running through Congress,
the suspense of a final vote.

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,770
I want an immediate call of the roll, don’t
let half a second pass.

29
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,770
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,890
Cable news loves this stuff

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,810
And you could see it in the coverage of the
House health care bill.

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,190
Interviews with politicians running through
Congress,

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,190
How you feeling this morning?

34
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,100
Do you guys think you’re going to get the
votes?

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,210
graphics tracking the updated vote count,

36
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,340
and tons of focus on how Trump was persuading
Republicans to vote for the bill.

37
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,110
President Trump on Capitol Hill trying to
close the health care deal.

38
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,420
The question now becomes, “Can they close
the deal quick enough?”

39
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,700
It was CNN’s best attempt to make reality
look like a political soap opera.

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,590
Cable news’ fixation on the spectacle of
a big vote makes for good TV,

41
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,720
The pressure, the arm-twisting, the ultimatum.

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,549
but it’s terrible for viewers at home.

43
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,240
It tells viewers nothing about whether the
Republican health care bill is actually a

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
good idea.

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,970
Do you have a sense of whether or not the
White House has enough votes?

46
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,440
What do you think, do you have the votes?

47
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,230
You can watch hours of these segments and
still not understand what the bill does.

48
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,430
So you’re a “no” vote.

49
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,950
That sounds like you’re going to be a “yes”?

50
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,550
Are you a “no” or a “yes”?

51
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,230
I am still a “no.”

52
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,430
Thank you, I’m glad we got that out of the
way.

53
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,330
This kind of tunnel vision turns news coverage
into a circus of spin and misinformation.

54
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,980
Like in this interview with Wolf Blitzer and
Republican Tom Garrett.

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,099
Congressional Budget Office report, as you
know, 24 million would be uninsured by 2026.

56
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,530
The interview starts strong.

57
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,420
If the bill fails, do you think President
Trump will be blamed for the failure?

58
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,580
Kind of a dumb question, but okay.

59
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,810
It’s absolutely undeniable that Obamacare
is in a death spiral, and if we just let the

60
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,580
status quo go, we’re going to see what real
pain and suffering looks like.

61
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,240
Okay, this would be a great time for some
good journalism.

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,460
Obamacare is not in a death spiral.

63
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,980
Experts actually worry that the Republican
health care bill would be a recipe for death

64
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,040
spirals because it reduces healthy people’s
incentives to stay insured.

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,290
Come on Wolf, easy follow-up, you’ve got
this!

66
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,230
You were supposed to go to the White House
for a pizza and bowling event with the president

67
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,230
tonight.

68
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,560
I take it that’s been canceled?

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,730
Are you serious?

70
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,959
When is that pizza and bowling event going
to be rescheduled for.

71
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,410
What kind of a wolf doesn’t have a taste
for blood?

72
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,410
Carlos.

73
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,410
Sorry.

74
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,710
A better use of this airtime would be to talk
to actual health care experts, like any of

75
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,500
the major medical organizations that have
come out against the GOP bill.

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,670
The bill is garbage, Donald.

77
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,220
But the House of Cards approach to news means
that most interviews go to politicians or

78
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,120
pundits, who haven’t read the bill and aren’t
going to give straight answers to begin with.

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,370
I could probably tell you that I read every
word and I wouldn’t be telling you the truth

80
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,800
nor would any other member.

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,250
So even when journalists do ask good questions,
you get train wrecks like this.

82
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,010
Their premiums will not go through the roof?

83
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,380
The goal is to make certain that they do not.

84
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,349
Will their premiums rise, Congresswoman?

85
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,360
My hope would be that their premiums would
not rise.

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,390
People who have preexisting conditions, can
you assure them that their premiums will not

87
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,390
rise?

88
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,390
The goal…

89
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,070
But the real danger of this type of news coverage
has nothing to do with dumb interviews.

90
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,650
It’s that when you treat big congressional
votes like soap operas, you train audiences

91
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,830
to think in terms of politics instead of policy.

92
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,349
Train people to ask “What’s stopping this
from passing?”

93
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,509
instead of “Should we pass this at all?”

94
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,560
What do you want to see in this bill, how
would you change it?

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,830
Why won’t you vote for it in the form that
it’s in now?

96
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,759
So the problem isn’t that the GOP bill cuts
coverage, it’s that it doesn’t appease

97
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,089
the House Freedom Caucus.

98
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:33,309
What changes would you need to see in order
to get to “yes?”

99
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:36,030
What could the president say to get you on
board?

100
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,139
The problem isn’t that it slashes Medicaid,
it’s that Democrats aren’t doing enough

101
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,139
to compromise.

102
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,469
Are you making efforts to come together?

103
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:47,210
What have Democrats done so far to help improve
this bill and work with Republicans?

104
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,059
Just like on House of Cards, success becomes
less about making good policy, and more about

105
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,669
just passing something.

106
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,460
We need a bill we can pass.

107
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,460
Resolving the drama.

108
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,039
If it doesn’t pass, then what?

109
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,750
Which means if the bill we end up with is
a disaster for the country, but secures enough

110
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,449
votes, it looks like a win.

111
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,129
A big win for Republicans on this day after
a major setback only six weeks ago.

112
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,569
House members said it was the kind of deal-making
that won rave reviews.

113
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:17,880
This is a huge moment of competence and that
is no small thing.

114
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,910
We show unity!

115
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,910
We offer progress!

116
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,509
That approach is a nightmare when dealing
with any policy issue, but it’s especially

117
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,449
reckless when it comes to health care.

118
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,680
When people’s lives are actually on the
line.

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,559
And the frustrating thing is, you don’t
need the drama to get people to watch.

120
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:36,460
People want clear, fact-based information
about what’s happening to their health care.

121
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,279
And you actually saw a glimpse of this during
a CNN town hall with Tom Price.

122
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,830
Question after question from real people about
stuff that actually matters to them.

123
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,020
Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?

124
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,289
The bill allows insurance companies to charge
much higher premiums for people in my age

125
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,289
group.

126
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,479
How can you justify that change?

127
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,629
It was this surreal moment of clarity and
thoughtfulness on cable news.

128
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,830
And then, at the very last second:

129
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,159
How are you going to get this plan through
Congress when you can’t get these members

130
00:06:05,159 --> 00:00:00,000
of your own party to support it?
