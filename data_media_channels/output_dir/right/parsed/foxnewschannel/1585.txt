DAY IN WHETHER OR NOT THAT
NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT IN JUNE ON
THE 12TH ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE.
WATCH FOR THAT TO PLAY OUT.
IN THE MEANTIME THIS EVENING, A
MEETING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
BEEN IN AT DINNER TONIGHT WITH
GOVERNORS ON BORDER SECURITY AND
SAFE COMMUNITIES, THAT'S
HAPPENING IN THE BLUE ROOM.
HERE ARE SOME OF THE PLAY OUT.
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, I'M
DELIGHTED TO WELCOME FIVE OF OUR
NATION'S GREAT GOVERNORS TO THE
WHITE HOUSE.
GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON, GOVERNER
DUCEY, GOVERNOR BRYANT,
GOVERNOR MARTINEZ AND
GOVERNOR McMASTER, THEY ARE
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB.
WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT
NUMEROUS THINGS.
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS SO IMPORTANT
TO US IS TO DISCUSS THE BORDER
AND BORDER SECURITY, CRIME AND
OTHER THINGS, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE
WILL BE FOCUSING ON TONIGHT.
WE ARE GRATEFUL ALSO TO BE
JOINED BY SECRETARY NIELSEN, WHO
IS REALLY WORKING VERY HARD.
BAD LAWS.
WE HAVE LAWS THAT ARE THE WORST
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AS FAR AS
STOPPING PEOPLE FROM COMING IN,
BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE
DOWN OVER 40% BORDER CROSSINGS.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT I
THINK NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN ABLE
TO DO, WE ARE DOWN OVER 40%.
TONIGHT WE WILL BE DISCUSSING
JOINT EFFORTS TO STOP ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION AND SECURE THE
BORDERS ALSO.
WE ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING
THE DEADLY RAVAGES OF DRUGS,
GANGS AND CRIME THAT IS POURING
ACROSS OUR BORDER AND WE ARE
STOPPING IT AND GETTING THEM OUT
WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GET
THROUGH AND THE ONLY REASON THEY
DO GET THROUGH IS BECAUSE OF OUR
WEAK LAWS THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN
GIVEN TO US BY WEEK PEOPLE IN
CONGRESS, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
BEEN HORRIBLE ON BORDER SECURITY
BEEN HORRIBLE ON BORDER SECURIT
SECURITY.
FRANKLY, IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED
AND MANY OF THEM ARE STANDING
AGREEING WITH ME 100%.
AS YOU KNOW, I RECENTLY DEPLOYED
THE NATIONAL GUARD TO THE
SOUTHERN BORDER AND I WANT TO
THANK EACH OF THE GOVERNORS HERE
TONIGHT.
THEY'VE ALL BEEN EXTREMELY
HELPFUL.
IF SENT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THOSE
BORDERS AND WE APPRECIATE IT
VERY MUCH.
WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH
CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE CRIPPLING
LOOPHOLES AND ESPECIALLY THE
DISGRACEFUL PRACTICE OF CATCH
AND RELEASE.
THAT'S WHERE YOU CATCH SOMEBODY
COME AND TALK TO THEM, SIGN THEM
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO RELEASE
THEM.
AND IT'S A HORRIBLE SITUATION.
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO THEN SHOW
UP TO COURT, A VERY SMALL
PERCENTAGE SHOW UP TO COURT AND
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY GET LOST IN
OUR COUNTRY AND IN SOME CASES
THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT YOU
WANT IN THE COUNTRY.
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CATCH
AND RELEASE.
WE HAVE TO END IT.
WE ARE WORKING WITH CONGRESS ON
THAT.
THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN THERE A
LONG TIME AND THEY ARE HORRIBLE.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE WILL USE
EVERY RELEVANT LEGAL AUTHORITY
TO IMMEDIATELY PROTECT OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY AND TO
DISMANTLE THE VIOLENT CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS PLAGUING THE
NATION AND POISONING OUR
CHILDREN.
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH DRUGS IS A
DISGRACE.
WHICH STARTED THE WALL, WE HAVE
$1.6 BILLION FOR THE WALL.
WE STARTED NEW SECTIONS AND WE
STARTED FIXING LARGE SECTIONS OF
WALL.
WE HAVE AREAS IN SAN DIEGO THAT
ARE GOING UP VERY RAPIDLY.
WE COULD HAVE WAITED AND WE
WOULD HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS
SUPPORT TO BUILD THE WALL
BECAUSE THEY WANTED IT VERY
BADLY IN SAN DIEGO.
WE DECIDED TO GO FORWARD
INSTEAD.
WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON
THE WALL, BUT NOW WE ARE GOING
FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND WE
NEED THE WALL FOR PROTECTION OF
