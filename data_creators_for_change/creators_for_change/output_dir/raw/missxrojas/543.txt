1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
everyone a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,380
smiles video for example the USA has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,410
new president president obama who has

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,420
already done amazing things with

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,179
particular connection to one ton<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ebay</font>

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,030
or issued orders with particular

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,130
connection to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Antonio Bay and climate</font>

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's good stuff so far</font>

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">but don't expect miracles because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he is</font>

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,869
in the humid as shopping has amazing

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,900
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are that the UK has finally</font>

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,430
admitted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in recession which is</font>

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,469
just weird because we've all known that

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,260
for absolutely ages and now something

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,270
like our recession is like well we

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,270
already know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hard to</font>

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,399
avoid the fact that all these who shops

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,930
are closing down and everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like oh</font>

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,899
wait I have less money than I used to

20
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,760
crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything is costing more you</font>

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,649
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow I just I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that</font>

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,820
before today a woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave birth to</font>

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,010
octuplets 88 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently I don't know</font>

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,210
haven't read enough into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the story I</font>

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,159
haven't even had a chance but the

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,990
doctors didn't expect to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eighth</font>

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,049
baby how does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work she was the</font>

28
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,549
mother aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were gonna have</font>

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,470
hot chocolates do the theme was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,840
die do they have like designing this

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,689
amazing seven baby stroller and then

32
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,220
they're like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap dozen of them in</font>

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,840
there it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to have seven</font>

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,979
kids as it is without an eighth one

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,350
another amazing thing is that I know

36
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,180
it's a piece of news that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrify</font>

37
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,189
Maureen Johnson but there are immortal

38
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,860
jellyfish jellyfish that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are immortal</font>

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,890
jellyfish there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a species and</font>

40
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,299
they have two parts the name when I

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,619
believe one pot the name begins with t

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,189
and one part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name goes within and</font>

43
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,450
they're born they let their normal

44
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,189
jellyfish eyes when they have jellyfish

45
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,320
babies and then they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to being</font>

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,909
bait it sounds like elsewhere it's also

47
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,799
really weird because obviously if these

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,229
types of jellyfish are immortal as it

49
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,590
were then then they keep you know

50
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,759
reproducing they're going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">the oceans and then they're going to</font>

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,750
evolve and now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk on land and</font>

53
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,310
then they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to grow really big</font>

54
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,079
because they have more space when they

55
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,330
will command and then they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,340
kill all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us with editor electric</font>

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,380
shocks

58
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,700
and we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die painful deaths</font>

59
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,920
all become slaves to the jellyfish is my

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,660
personal theory and I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this</font>

61
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,830
video to talk about jellyfish or

62
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,080
recessions or Obama's or whatever i made

63
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this video to talk about a book that i</font>

64
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,500
read one of the first books<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've read it</font>

65
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,240
while just because I've not been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

66
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">read which is really weird for me</font>

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
because I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a substitute that is</font>

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,270
literally taking up every ounce more

69
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,880
time that I'm not furiously trying to

70
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,170
find gossip well and then realizing that

71
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,550
it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually shown in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US last</font>

72
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">night what the hell the book is called</font>

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,780
go ask alice a lot of you and me or said

74
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,790
probably heard of it but it's one that

75
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,410
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not known usually in the UK I</font>

76
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,790
didn't know if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in printing UK</font>

77
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,740
cuz<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brought in Chicago but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

78
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">down the back of my bookshelf and then</font>

79
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,040
found it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then was like wow this is</font>

80
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,660
cool I can't really concentrate right

81
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,490
now but this book has about 200 pages

82
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,320
quite big checks and set out in a diary

83
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,120
formats even if it's based on the diary

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a 15 year old rugged drug addict and</font>

85
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,860
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of following her spiral into drug</font>

86
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,500
addiction that i read it today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

87
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like must read a depressing book</font>

88
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,060
today so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did everyone to talk about it</font>

89
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,980
because it kind of just offset a lot

90
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,590
Billy a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in me in some ways</font>

91
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,020
it kind of reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me of books that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

92
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,850
similar themes of general

93
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,860
self-destructiveness and depression so

94
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,350
on and the person that comes to mind is

95
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">a note of madness by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tabitha suzama fuel</font>

96
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,890
which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if you remember</font>

97
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,520
hugely but I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest fan and</font>

98
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,750
this was way with like a year ago

99
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that I read it um and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me go</font>

100
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,540
ask alice just everything that that big

101
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,920
doesn't make it has that sense of

102
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,980
realistic pneus reality father that a

103
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,640
net of madness also almost lacks in

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,800
favor of just depressing the crap out of

105
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,709
me and while girls gasp is an uplifting

106
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,220
entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I just I really liked it I</font>

107
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,320
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is tied to</font>

108
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,580
the fact that you are told at the

109
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,660
beginning that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

110
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,300
diary and that every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

111
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,190
shocking happens as it frequently does

112
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">throughout the book you just think oh</font>

113
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,400
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this really happened the</font>

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,150
balance of ups and downs just<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

115
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,320
incredible and it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> intense and</font>

116
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,298
I read this book in about an hour and a

117
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,010
half or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that with my</font>

118
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,269
highlighter because they're quite a few

119
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,190
bits that i liked that i highlighted<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

120
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've actually read a book too</font>

121
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,180
right now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't quite them for you</font>

122
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,710
but yes so I really enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and if</font>

123
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,530
you like books about slightly depressing

124
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,760
the intellect drug addiction i would

125
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,500
recommend it each range wise you know

126
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge person to age band things</font>

127
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,000
but definitely routine through to young

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,760
adults whatever and then i would say

129
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there would be some adults who</font>

130
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,820
would enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as well I don't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

131
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,830
not as long as they're not usually picky

132
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,790
about really much teenagers<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's but</font>

133
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,650
it's all very it's a very honest account

134
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,420
I think it's worth reading and I think

135
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to some degree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's some parts of it</font>

136
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,280
really reminded me of the voice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

137
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,510
parts of Being a Wallflower by Stephen

138
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,540
to rock<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Boogaloo by Steven Chu</font>

139
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,290
box click on say like Stephen Chbosky

140
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,790
which if you haven't read you ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

141
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,650
because amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd you yeah that was</font>

142
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,970
just my kind of reading of the day I'm

143
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,960
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would give it five stars</font>

144
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,620
on Goodreads but it I do not really feel

145
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,300
like I could start in general I probably

146
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,920
have about three<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it wasn't so</font>

147
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,750
much that I liked it but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I</font>

148
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,010
appreciated it but it was more than

149
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,930
appreciation I can't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain it</font>

150
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,670
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate anyone giving any views</font>

151
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,380
or opinions whatever in video responses

152
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,630
or comments read them all I can't

153
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,920
promise that I will reply to them

154
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,810
