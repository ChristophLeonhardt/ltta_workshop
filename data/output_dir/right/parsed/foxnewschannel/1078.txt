TO DO.
BRIAN: SHE WENT ON TO SAY I
WAS WARNED BY MY FRIENDS NOT
TO LEGITIMIZE HIM.
HE'S PRESIDENT.
HERE TO REACT, SOCIAL MEDIA
STARS AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS
DIAMOND AND SILK.
SO, A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE
YOU WERE HERE COOKING.
DIAMOND, LET'S START WITH
YOU.
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE
PRESIDENT ACTED SO SWIFTLY?
>> LISTEN, I KNOW THIS IS
WHAT WE VOTED FOR.
THIS IS WHO WE VOTED FOR.
I AM SO HAPPY THAT HE
COMMUTED THE SENTENCE OF
ALICE AND I'M HAPPY THAT
IT'S SHINING A LIGHT ON THE
OVER CRIMINALIZATION OF
AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD
BE LOOKING AT WHEN IT
PERTAINS TO THE JUSTICE
SYSTEM.
SO I'M SO HAPPY.
AND I'M HAPPY THAT KIM
KARDASHIAN WENT TO THE
TABLE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> HAVE A SEAT.
TALKED TO OUR PRESIDENT AND
OUR PRESIDENT TOOK SWIFT
ACTION.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> I'M VERY HAPPY.
I'M HAPPY THAT ALICE IS
GETTING A SECOND CHANCE.
>> AND THEN ALSO LOOK AT THE
FACT THAT KIM KARDASHIAN,
SHE PUT ASIDE HER PERSONAL
DIFFERENCES AND WENT TO THE
TABLE.
YOU KNOW, IMAGINE JUST FOR
ONE MOMENT, IMAGINE IF
LEBRON JAMES WOULD STOP
SHOOTING OFF AT HIS MOUTH
AND DID THE SAME THING.
JUST SIMPLY IMAGINE IF THE
NFL PLAYERS WOULD STOP
KNEELING AT THE FLAG AND DO
THE SAME THING.
LEBRON JAMES AND A LOT OF
THESE OTHERS ARE TEACHING
MEN, ESPECIALLY OUR YOUNG
BLACK MEN IS HOW TO BE
COWARDS.
>> BIG DAY FOR ALICE JOHNSON
CALLED HER IN PERSON TO GIVE
HER THE NEWS.
VERY TEAR-FILLED CALL.
YOU GUYS MAKE A GREAT POINT
ABOUT COMING TO THE TABLE
AND HAVING A CONVERSATION.
BRIAN MADE THAT POINT
EARLIER THIS WEEK WITH THE
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE
WHITE HOUSE, AT LEAST JUST
SHOW UP AND TALK TO THE
PRESIDENT ABOUT THE ISSUES
YOU CARE ABOUT AND MAKE SOME
CHANGE.
HOW DO WE GET TO A PLACE
WHERE WE ARE NOT JUST
ATTACKING EACH OTHER AND
ACTUALLY START TO HAVE
CONVERSATION.
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO
CHANGE THAT.
>> FIRST OF ALL, WE NEED TO
PUT ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> LOOK AT THIS PRESIDENT
AND THE AMAZING JOB HE IS
DOING.
WE HAD AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
PRESIDENT THAT DID NOT
REALLY TACKLE THE JUSTICE
SYSTEM.
JUSTICE WE
JUSTICE REFORM.
HERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE
LEFT AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE
SAYING WE NEED TO CHANGE THE
JUSTICE SYSTEM.
WELL, NOW WE HAVE A
PRESIDENT.
>> YES.
>> ALONG WITH THE IVANKA
TRUMP AND JARED KUSHNER.
>> YES.
>> THEY'RE HOPING TO CHANGE
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.
THIS IS THE TIME WE NEED TO
HEAR YOUR VOICES.
PUT ASIDE YOUR DIFFERENCES
COME TO THE TABLE AND LET'S
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
>> STOP BEING A COWARD.
STEVE: LADIES, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THE FACT SO IN ABOUT
90 MINUTES THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES IS GOING
TO BE BLASTING OFF FROM
JOINT BASE ANDREWS.
GO UP TO QUEBEC HAVE THAT G
7 SUMMIT.
SOUNDS LIKE IS HE GOING TO
WALK OUT HALF A DAY EARLY.
TIMES ARE TENSE THERE RIGHT
NOW BETWEEN HIM AND THE
LEADERS OF CANADA AND
FRANCE.
THEY DON'T LIKE THE TARIFF
TALK.
THEY DON'T LIKE THE TRADE
TALK.
HOW DO YOU LIKE HOW THE
PRESIDENT IS DEALING WITH
WORLD LEADERS?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOVE THE WAY HE IS DEALING
WITH THESE LEADERS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO WAIVER.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A
TRADE WAR.
WE WANT FAIR TRADE.
AND WHEN HE'S DONE, THIS IS
GOING TO BE FAIR AND EQUAL
ACROSS THE BOARD.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> AND, IF THEY DON'T LIKE
IT, THEY CAN GO SOMEWHERE
AND DO SOMETHING ELSE.
>> YES.
>> THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO
BE UP UNDER THIS PRESIDENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO WAIVER
ON IT.
AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
>> ONE MORE AMAZING THING,
IS HE DOING THIS FOR THE
SAKE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
