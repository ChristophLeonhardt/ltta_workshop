hi I'm Roger Frampton and I'm a movement coach from London and I'm author of the book the flexible body I think one of the main reasons people go to the gym is is a motivational aspect because to me there's nothing really at a gym there's any different to what you have at home I look around my house I see my sofa that's for me they're the last like parallel bars I see a chair oh my god what balances can I do on a chair can I stretch my legs on the chair I look around how to go into the kitchen I see all these different heights so the way I'm viewing things around the house is I'm going how can I use this because the reason is the number one tool for training is your body that's all you really need but you're using these tools and your end instead of the tool moving around you you move the tool around so even if I picked up a dumbbell it's my shoulder that moves the dumbbell not the dumbbell that tells me where to go or the benchpress that forces me to push in the same position we are able to move in a multitude of planes and by viewing your your room where you're from room or your kitchen as all these different tools you'll never need to go to the gym again I run a class and I say to people right guys we're all gonna sit in a squat and because they've got their Lululemon on and their training gear like yeah sure I'll sit in a squat oh why don't why won't you do this outside of here oh you know you know I'm in my training gear I'm ready I'm in training mode I mean have you ever looked at a kid and see it in training mode and out of training mode or giving particular time to a you know this is my training time and now this is my life because if you really divide that up your training time is two hours in a hundred hours a week every time I'm at home and I'm sitting like washing TV I need to be sitting within a stretch because if I'm not seeing a stretch there the amount of time I'm spending in a gym is not really enough time to reverse so what you need to do is all the time you need to be thinking what can I be doing right now to a not get my body any tighter or even better be start reversing some of the damage already done you
