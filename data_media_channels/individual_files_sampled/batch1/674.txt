Tang and let me start with you there are a lot of important issues many of which are also being discussed at that g7 summit in Canada where there is a lot of discord because of US president Donald Trump's trade policies how was that disunity being viewed in China well quite frankly it's not just China it's around the world I mean you have a tale of two summits one is full of strife and discord strife between the members and Twitter tirades and then also issues about trade on the other side you seem to have a very well organized oiled gathering in headed by China but part of this SCO grouping and for the first time Pakistan and India there and it's going to be a very interesting event mister on web for your thoughts are you as optimistic as mr. Tang and could this be a basis for an alternative to the traditional world order that's represented by the seven countries meeting in Canada do you think well perhaps remains to be seen I still think that each on high cooperation organization still has a lot of things to work out taking to account the relationships within the organization between countries in particular China and India I've only been able to forge closer ties of late case the story of 2017 between China and India was quite different until we saw the meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President President Xi Jingping over the course of this year only of late in May Indian Pakistan also have outstanding issues with each other yeah not least because of Kashmir but also because of other issues as well that are outstanding the china-pakistan economic corridor for example is something that is a thorn in India side and so whereas while the SEO does have a lot of promise perhaps in some sort of alternative mechanism one could argue at the same time this is still an organization it has its own inner tensions and in issues that have to be worked out in order for it to go in some sort of cohesive direction and make a contribution to regional order and we will be talking about all of the issues that you raised in more detail in the program but mr. Jacob what do you think of the sort of emerging proximity debts developing between these countries China Russia and India is it a good start to work on some of the world's major issues right now and not just the ones between those countries the Chinese have been meeting in a file format for well over a decade now and this latest edition of India and Pakistan to the SCO well the SEO looks right now in comparison to g7 team ongoing right now because all Trump is showing his punches that fit and right at his allies by contrast es you lose control technics organized but for all that the g7 represents the commonality of values it's much deeper is much more broader scope for cooperation than VSU and I mentioned I think there are several challenges that PSEO continues to face the Indians are certainly not looking at the SEO at the platform for India and Pakistan who is all push me I think a lot of Chinese scholars talk about that but in the very clear we don't want third party mediation in this particular matter so this is not you know the Indians out they don't see the SEO as a substitute for other regional organizations you know so perhaps there won't be much progress on the issue between India and Pakistan but what about China's great one belt one road project that India has been opposed to because of one of the one of the elements of the project is going through disputed Kashmir the china-pakistan economic corridor do you think that we can expect any progress mr. Jacob on that issue because this is such a key plan for China Sea on CPAC I think the government position remains unchanged the internment position is that this is project that violates Incan sovereignity so the opposition is still very strong but having said that you know the do Bri is here to stay as part of the SCO s agenda and I mean there is no running away from it and the Indians will have to find a way to deal with it and if you look at the record last year or even as later as early this year the Indians will simply not sign on to anything that mentions Bri but you know the forum still offers an opportunity for conversations on sigh maybe the Chinese escapology RI the engines can refuse to call it PRI but some sort of project some sort of cooperative measures will I think eventually evolve from these meetings right so we will wait to see how much progress they can make on China's one belt one road project when India might not necessarily agree to some parts of that plan one thing satang and let me bring you in now one issue that these countries do seem to agree on is Iran and the Iran nuclear deal and not imposing sanctions against the country this is going to be Iranian president Hassan rouhani's it is his first foreign trip since the u.s. pulled out of that Iran nuclear deal do you think that we can expect these countries not just China India and Russia which make up you know three of the world's biggest economies three in the top ten but also the other Central Asian countries can we expect them to continue to do business with Iran absolutely I don't think there'll be any change I think Russia China and India are all in favor of this as are the majority of the g7 I think it's a really a six six versus one right now but you know I want to go back and touch upon a point that was made about the the belt and road initiative in order for India to come into its own it needs jobs and needs infrastructure and I think Modi and XI are putting together and realizing that they can work together and be far more powerful the fact is that they control 40 40 percent of the world's population they're the fastest-growing a large economies in the world and together they could change the way that everything is done today previously we've always looked towards capital to make the rules but when the capital 60% of which is in Europe and the United States to make investments it has to choose places where the money can grow and that right now is India in China and I think you're going to see them cooperating out of mutual interest it does not mean that India will abandon its strategic security relationships with the United States but it does mean that they're going to make their own paths as they go through this so you are more positive then about the India China relationship going forward and also positive that all these countries will continue to do business with Iran mr. on the web what do you think are these countries going to risk facing US sanctions to do business with Iran possibly this is a very interesting issue it remains to be seen what what the issue and Iran's membership is going to be but clearly if the sco countries vote for iran's or full membership inclusion to the su from observer status in the face of the establishment of US sanctions against iran enlighted withdrawal from the comprehensive ten for a fraction then of course it's going to be a vote against what the US has been doing you know in trying to behave in a manner which overturns established norms and not you know respecting agreements that have been strapped before and so that would be completely interesting and I think they might want to do that if it's at all possible for the u.s. to galvanize international support on the matter and for for us see the the reinstitution of UN sanctions against Iran mind you Iran has failed to become to attain full membership status it has not met to the standards of that because of the fact that it was under UN sanctions until the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and so that has prevented Iran one containing full membership and now that the sanctions are lifted there's been a window of opportunity for Iran to get full membership and now may be the opportunity if the tide of international opinion does go on a favor of the US remains to be seen and perhaps the g7 meeting might be one of those vehicles to work that out to try and the Trump administration to galvanize international support whether that happens another question and it may be that they'll attempt to prevent Iran from getting in yes you're fully and mr. Jacob what do you think about India's prospects for continuing to do business with Iran they of course have a very long-standing relationship and we heard from the Indian Foreign Minister just days before the summit that no country can put pressure on them when it comes to doing business with other countries I think the Indian Foreign Ministry has already conveyed its views to the Americans I think we are very determined to continue our because it's practically a near neighbor it's an influential and important player in the region what I think is going to happen is that the American value the relationship with India and therefore might be willing to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis as far as the India Iran engagement is concerned and I think there's not much that the Americans are going to gain by putting pressure on India as far as Iran is concerned we've not getting much out of the red and I don't think as far as connectivity or the general relationship with Iran is concerned it's helpful for us to take an onboard you know these wild swings in policy on Iran mr. Jiang and I want you to expand on how you think China will proceed with Iran because Chinese companies have experienced US sanctions you know which have driven them to bankruptcy China is in bilateral trade talks with the u.s. these are all pressures as it looks into investing further in Iran surely well the issue here is that currently the US which represents 24 percent of the world's GDP is at economic odds imposing sanctions or about to impose tariffs on 60 percent of the rest of the world now if you start thinking about that number it makes sense for those 60 percent to do just as was the g7 by macron he said well you know quite frankly we can go our own way and the US can go its this would be a massive challenge to dollar trade dollar hige enemy and it could result in helping Europe also China it would set in place it firmly this idea that this is a multilateral world this is not going to be dominated in future by one country in essence the United States by acting on its fears may have just increased and accelerated the realization of them and Mister on web while the United States has pulled out of this Iran nuclear deal it is going into a summit with the North Korean leader Kim jong-un which is of course going to be another very big issue at the SCO summit do you think that Russia and China have been sidelined at all by what's going on between Trump and Kim jong-un well at least that's the way they see it at this point in time why they see themselves being of course critical stakeholders one of the pay of members to the six-party talks the six-party arrangement therefore feel that any resolution to the ongoing Korean North Korean nuclear crisis is going to have to involve them and yeah certainly they feel that way but uh you know I would argue another observers have argued and I think this is where even the u.s. may be arguing that there's going to be a season for everything and right now what we need to focus on or at least they need to focus on in terms of the Trump administration meeting the Pyongyang's regime next week is to focus on a bilateral discussion and work out the things that pertain to that bilateral relationship or adversarial relationship as it stands and that subsequently will be a fora for these other meetings which the Russians and Chinese can be involved but the but the opposite has happened India in a run-up to the summit we've seen a range of developments where where Beijing and Moscow Tokyo Seoul are all trying to get their interests represented at the table at the table next week at the summit represented by North Korea on the one side in terms of Chinese interests possibly even Russian interests and on the other side of the table in terms of president Trump coming into the meeting representing Tokyo's and Seoul's interests so it's going to be a bit of a you know a complex situation in extreme training that's all that out but this is what we're seeing and some of us feel that this just increases the risks of the railing some of the constructive outcomes that need to be had from this summitry mr. tang and I could see you wanted to come in earlier yeah I am I'm gonna disagree with my colleague there I I don't think there is there's an asymmetrical relationship right now the US will not allow any kind of delay in denuclearization and North Korea cannot afford we for trust reasons to speed it up so I don't think much more than constructive than a handshake could come out of any kind of meeting between these two I do agree that the rest of the countries are concerned that Trump might try to do a cowboy and just say look as long as you can't send a missile to to Washington it's okay this is something that Abby has been very nervous about because no one can judge exactly where he's going to go or what he's about to do but this idea that you know we have to get above the looking at the trees and see the force you're seeing a massive geopolitical shift here which is being accelerated by Washington's fears by Trump's actions his unreliability everybody is drifting more and more east not only for markets but for political leadership so at this point I I think it's foolish to be talking about sidelined countries in the end this comes back to the six-party talks because there's no other way to resolve it there are interests involved by all of these parties and this should be cut 'old by consensus yeah not by some two Cowboys sitting down and trying to figure out how they can do things gentlemen we don't have very long left in the show and I would like to ask a final question to all of you mr. Jacob let me begin with you is the sort of trumps eyelash analyst isolationism creating the conditions for a challenge to this sort of world order with the u.s. at the top where we see more senses rather than the sort of unipolar world the kind of consensus that mr. tang and speaking about I know I think the situation is a bit more complicated in that than that innatron just get a lot of flack for being you know irrational maybe acting like a cowboy but I know what structures don't change so quickly so suddenly and you know the very fact that example to the korea-us summit has even come to this I mean it's even taking place I think shows that the u.s. is not lost on its cars or us is not entirely out of options so there are creative options that the humours is stable the question is whether other countries are going to be able to deal with the changes that both US is driving as well as China is writing you know strong as an irrational act acknowledged mr. on Webb would you like to pick up on that before I give mr. Chang in the last word you know I can no I would like to have a word in here I mean it's to come back to the point until mr. Tannen made I'm not saying that Russia and China are being sidelined I'm saying that he perceives to be sidelined that's not helpful clearly I agree with that point and that's where the discussion needs to be steered in the right direction but in terms of the u.s. of the of us behavior yes I think at the baseline of the summit I think what needs to be had is a handshake and building a rapport and a working relationship otherwise you will not have follow-on discussions this would be a one-off at the same time the u.s. clearly is also realizing the limits of coming up with an absolutist position that there will have to be some give-and-take and that this is going to be a process quote unquote president Trump's words having said that I think this idea of this principle realism that James mattis talks about and the shangri-la dialogue is clearly hurting the u.s. because it's isolating itself it's losing a lot of friends and burning bridges and I agree to the point about the shift towards a more multilateral world in which we don't have to wait for the Americans or seek permissions and Americans and more because we can form our own Rachel and and blocks and it's a tag and I can imagine that you would agree with mr. on web on that last point yes I would you have three major countries India China and Russia meeting in a meeting it's well choreographed and you have six very unhappy European excuse me g7 members who are leaning towards breaking away from the US economy mr. Jacob do would do you have anything that you'd like to add to that I think you know like I said the g7 is an institution of much longer standing much greater depth and great a commonality of values I think you know they are not yet sacraments but these disciplines do not necessarily mean that the u.s. is going to be cut out of the picture or all these six countries are gonna line up against the u.s. yes there's a great deal of unhappiness with respect to Iran but you know the same way that mr. Trump calls the deal with the meeting with not Korea process yeah you know the unraveling of the deal is also a process I don't think things are so blackened when I get all right mr. Jacob thank you very much for that and thank you to all of our guests that is Graham on Webb in Singapore on a tango in Beijing and jab and Jacob in New Delhi and thank you too for watching you can see the programme again any time by visiting our website al-jazeera calm and for further discussion do go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com/ /aj inside story you can also join the conversation on Twitter a handless at AJ inside story from me Elizabeth puranam and the whole team here bye for now you
