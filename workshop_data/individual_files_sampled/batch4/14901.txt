one of my favorite things in life is social media atheists militant atheists I don't care if you don't believe in God that's your problem but militant ones ones who are like angry because other people believe in God and they have to like tell you how angry they are and it's just super tiresome but there there's this there's this hatred for religion out there among the life they just despise it and the reason they despise is of course if you're worshiping God you're not worshiping government and by government they mean they're elite because they assume government is their elite because they believe that they have some sort of right to rule so it's really heresy to actually worship God instead of government what that is down and Chris Pratt did it any any blue mind I mean to to tell them to tell a giant group of cultural liberals no I don't worship you I don't worship government I don't worship a government composed of people like you ruling over people like me it's blasphemy to they can't tolerate it they get angry that's what rebellion is that's a real rebel that's a guy with a cause that's a guy with a clue that's a guy who's actually taking a risk because you know there are people now we're gonna be going well you know Chris Pratt's super popular actor but also decent human being mm I'm not sure you know we gotta weigh those against each other you know want to take the chance the people are not gonna want that there are certain people who are not going to work with him because he has confessed to to possessing some form of religious faith it's gonna freak them out wait Danny well he just doesn't care that's real rebellion and that's going on more and more and you can do it in your daily life we don't have to kneel down to these false idols of leftism we don't have to pray to the elite we owe them nothing we don't know them reverence we don't know them respect the purpose of the elite and in society there there is a purpose for an elite own elite who who comes in and and you know manages the institutions of society while the rest of normal people go out and you know work and be with their families everything there is a purpose for an elite but they the purpose of elite is is not to be served it is to serve yeah you get some privileges in the elite but at the end of the day your duty is to normal people your duty is to serve our elite doesn't understand that our elite thinks their duty doesn't exist you
