and and Eddie loud the question is why I asked the question why the timing now it's really a leading question because you could have asked the same question why did Donald Trump rush into that meeting with the South Koreans when he wasn't even supposed to be in there and immediately started blabbing about wanting to get together with Kim Jong hoon what did he not want on the front page of the newspaper he didn't want the stormy Daniels story on the front page of the newspaper do you think the White House might have called and put some pressure on again on the house Intel committee to randomly select yesterday to look or to leap before they looked there was no reason for them to put this out yesterday they knew they were gonna be making fools of themselves yesterday but what happened yesterday stormy Daniels lawyer said hey we're giving your money back 60 minutes is moving forward with this interview and I think soar McDaniels has figured out she can make a lot more money giving the $130,000 back and she can say all she wants to say she says she has pictures she says she has videos she said she has everything this story as friends that are watching at home as I told you last week and mica told you last week this is the story the White House wants off the front pages of newspapers at all times so you know Eddie I just wonder if this is the latest attempt by Donald Trump to do anything possible to keep that story off the front page of the newspaper well I think you're absolutely right Jo I mean it's the kind of convergence of two factors I think there's the disaster that is the stormy Daniel stands Daniel's story and of course the ongoing Muller investigation as he kind of does that pinch sir move as he kind of closes in on Donald Trump and what we see here an interesting source of ways and we've seen this with the house Intel committee since the beginning is that politics Trump's right no pun intended Trump's the pursuit of truth and it's also the case I think that we live in a post fact world I mean Joyce Vance said last night that you know you can't you can debate the interpretation of the facts but you can't really debate the facts and what we see here is that in a post fact world partisan commitments rain and then I want to just kind of echo what representative Castro said as well Nunez just hit a sacrifice fly in order to bring Donald Trump home and all what bringing him home means is getting stormy dangles off off the front page so I think you're absolutely right Joe politics that trumped everything in this instance and of course meanwhile while we're talking about that former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunn Berg revealed last night that alleged payments to women are also on the special council's radar did Miller's folks ask anything that related to these issues around payments to people or women well look they asked if I had ever heard anything about that and my answer is I never have I don't know anything about it and I wouldn't have known about it in your FBI interview with Muller and they were asking about payments to women they were asking if I knew anything about it they were asking you if you knew anything about payments to women but I think it's pretty obvious that they're looking into this is so Cadi I'm sure in your years covering politics and covering political scandals I know the British never have any any sex scandals but if they did know specially not that Tory upstanding upstanding young fine good men but you know people forget so often that those that are in politics do have a family and there is a personal impact of this for so for everybody looking at this stormy Daniels story sort of erupting and now she's talked to 60 minutes and it's gonna everybody's gonna watch it on 60 minutes and Donald Trump's trying to stop 60 minutes from doing they they can't suspend the First Amendment because he doesn't like what stormy Daniels is going to say but you you just have to think that this really is having a personal impact inside the White House in fact they can't even deny it all they want it is having a personal impact and that's why perhaps that's why we're seeing all of these these wild lunges left and right by the Trump White House and their allies to try to keep that news off the front page yes there are two reasons the White House and the president in particular doesn't like the stormy Daniels story one is the legal implications was there something erroneous in the campaign finance in the reporting of any payments to stormy Daniels in order to try and keep her quiet to protect the candidate which would have been out of bounds in terms of campaign finance but as you suggest that much bigger story perhaps for Donald Trump is the personal story relations between the First Lady and the president have never seemed to be particularly warm we saw it at the inauguration it was very chilly between the two of them but we've also seen a particular downturn in relations and things that the first lady has done not showing up for things suddenly changing her travel plans ever since the beginning of January and that's exactly when the stormy Daniels story broke so this cannot be a particularly easy happy time for the president in his own marital relations when this is being splashed as you say on the front pages of all the papers and added to that there is a potential legal liability as well for him yep and it's interesting Jim VandeHei they're doing what they can to try to stop 60 minutes from running that interview they they don't have that power I mean do I mean they could I suppose they could file another injunction against stormy Daniels but you can't I mean if the Supreme Court allowed the New York Times in Washington Post to run the Pentagon Papers they're going to allow 60 minutes to interview a porn star aren't they it's hard to see how they can stop it she clearly wants to tell our story she has a story they think that people are super interested in you know going to your point about what's happening with Trump and what is he trying to what is he trying to skate by talking about by trying to talk about this house report I can't stress enough how much the White House is different today than even a month ago with so many of the restraints off of him the people who would say don't do that or have you thought about a different option there gone or they're all weakened and so now it really is Trump on his own going with his gut with a bunch of people around him nodding yeah go go go that's a smart move that's a smart move and so when you ask for a sort of a psychological interpretation of why he's doing what he's doing it's complex because I think so much of it now is I'm gonna do what I want to do if I want to go negotiate with the Koreans what the hell I'm gonna do it if I want to do terrace bring me by darn tariffs if I want to go take on a porn star on TV you know what I might just do that too and so I think we're in a whole new phase of the presidency that to me will be even wilder if you can imagine that than the first 15 months it is remarkable we'll still ahead on Morning Joe polls are gonna be opening just minutes from now in that closely watched congressional race in Pennsylvania we're gonna have a live report from the ground where President Trump is thrown his weight behind the Republican candidate who's trailing in the polls despite the fact Donald Trump won that district by 20 points Mitt Romney won the district by about 20 points and Republicans that run in this district usually win it by 20 points but right now it's the Democrat who looks like he may be winning this race tonight thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's
