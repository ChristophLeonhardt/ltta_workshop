1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,860
Japan’s shrinking population is forcing
the country to look for new workers.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,680
And Prime Minister Shinzo Abe thinks he’s
found the answer... women.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,660
Abe has outlined goals to create a “Japan
in which women shine”.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,020
The name given to it: “Womenomics.”

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,860
But while Womenomics has seen some success
getting more women into the workforce,

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,280
it still faces serious cultural hurdles.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,540
This is your Bloomberg QuickTake on the challenge
of breaking down gender bias in Japan.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,270
By 2020, Abe wants 30% of leadership positions
to be filled by women.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,340
He’s urged listed companies to appoint women
to executive and managerial roles.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,220
And he’s working to fix Japan’s daycare
shortage, while encouraging workplaces to be

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,700
more accommodating, so that mothers will feel
more inclined to rejoin the labor force.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,040
And it is working… sort of.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,340
Female labor participation rate rose from
46.2% in 2012 to 49.8% in 2017.

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,800
Isabel Reynolds: But most of the women that
have been added to the workforce are working

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,600
in these relatively low-paid, part-time jobs.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,549
There's kind of a mismatch there with his
goal of getting more women into management.

17
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,740
Although Abe frequently touts the success
of “Womenomics”, a closer look highlights

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,500
a work culture that systematically excludes
women.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,259
An expectation that women should stay at home
and be primary caregivers has held them back

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,740
in workplaces all over the world, but in
Japan that view is particularly deep-rooted.

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:41,280
A 2016 poll found that 45% of the men surveyed
agreed that “women-should-stay-at-home”.

22
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:47,039
Japan also has the third-highest gender pay
gap in the more developed OECD countries.

23
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:52,489
Although companies such as Toyota are appointing
female executives, change has been slow.

24
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:58,429
Only 4% of managerial positions are held by
women in Japan compared with 9% in China and

25
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:59,959
17% in the US.

26
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,779
Isabel Reynolds: It's just very much the working
culture has built up around men and around

27
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:06,960
the long hours they work.

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,000
It can be very bonding, they go out drinking
together in the evening, and women simply

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,250
don't fit into that cozy little world in a
lot of cases.

30
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,840
On top of that, just a tenth of the members
of Japan’s lower house are women, ranking

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,810
the nation among the lowest in female political
representation in the world.

32
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,910
Isabel Reynolds: If you look at Prime Minister
Abe's cabinet, he in fact only has two women,

33
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,010
at the moment, out of 20.

34
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,810
So he's not really reaching his own target
of having 30% of management positions taken

35
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,580
up by women.

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,519
Some say quotas should ultimately be legally
binding for real change to come about.

37
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,140
Such measures could have great economic benefit
--including one report suggesting that gender

38
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,300
parity could add $550 billion to Japan’s
gdp.

39
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,760
Isabel Reynolds: I don't think we're going
see a transformation overnight, or in the

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
next couple of years.

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,820
These people are obviously at the bottom of
the ladder in the corporate world, so they're

42
00:03:04,820 --> 00:00:00,000
not going to be the ones deciding how the
corporate culture works for some time.
