TRUMP'S VICTORY.

12
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:17,282
ESPECIALLY IN STATES LIKE

13
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,351
PENNSYLVANIA.

14
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,118
THE SAME COAL MINERS AND

15
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:21,420

BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY.

21
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:33,098
NICE TO SEE YOU SIR.

22
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:33,866
ARE THESE TARIFFS THAT

23
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,733
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT ON CHINESE

24
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:40,072
STEEL AND SOME OF THE OTHER

25
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:40,706
NODS TO THE COAL INDUSTRY

26
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:41,273
ENOUGH TO KEEP THESE

27
00:00:41,273 --> 00:00:42,507
BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRATS VOTING

28
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:44,543
REPUBLICAN?

29
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:47,512
>> I THINK WE WILL SEE.

30
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:48,247
WE'VE GOT AN INTERESTING

31
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:49,014
PRIMARY COMING UP.

32
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:50,949
WE'VE GOT CONGRESSIONAL SEATS.

33
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:51,750
SOME SPECIAL ELECTIONS FOR

34
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,651
STATE HOUSE SEAT SO IT WILL BE

35
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:56,622
INTERESTING.

36
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:57,556
OF COURSE TARIFFS HAVE CUT BOTH

37
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:57,856
WAYS.

38
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,891
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, IF WE SEE

39
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,694
THIS DIRECTING MORE ATTENTION

40
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:03,462
AT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

41
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,196
ISSUES, WE THINK THAT WOULD BE

42
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:04,629
A BIG SUCCESS.

43
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,867
>>LELAND: WHEN YOU SAY THEY CUT

44
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:09,801
BOTH WAYS, ARE THERE INDUSTRIES

45
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,103
IN PENNSYLVANIA COMING OUT

46
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:11,837
AGAINST THESE TARIFFS?

47
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:12,738
OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE IN PLACES

48
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:13,505
LIKE IOWA AND ILLINOIS.

49
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:21,113
>> THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE

50
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:22,047
EXPRESSED CONCERN BECAUSE IT

51
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:22,881
HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER COSTS.

52
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,182
YOU SEE THE REACTION FROM THE

53
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:26,818
AGRICULTURE SIGN.

54
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:27,786
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE POSITIONING

55
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:28,520
ON BOTH SIDES.

56
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,388
WE CAN FOCUS ATTENTION ON SOME

57
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:30,589
OF THE THINGS WE'VE GOT TO PAY

58
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:31,023
ATTENTION TO.

59
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:32,090
FOR EXAMPLE, A NUMBER OF

60
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,458
MEMBERS HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT

61
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,192
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF

62
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:35,394
INTERACTION WITH THE CHINESE

63
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:39,898
GOVERNMENT FOR INTELLECTUAL

64
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:40,265
PROPERTY.

65
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:40,832
THAT WOULD BE IN OUR

66
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:41,600
PERSPECTIVE, A BIG VICTORY.

67
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,704
>>LELAND: HOW ARE EMPLOYERS WHO

68
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:47,306

ABOUT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

72
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:57,683
HOW DO THEY TRANSLATE THEIR

73
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,151
EXCITEMENT AS EMPLOYERS DOWN TO

74
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,852
THEIR EMPLOYEES?>> GREAT

75

QUESTION.

76
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,254
AS A RESULT OF THE TAX REFORM

77
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:05,991
ACT, WE SEE IN PENNSYLVANIA THE

78
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:06,858
POSITIVE RESULTS OF THAT WITH

79
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:07,492
DOLLARS COMING IN.

80
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,695
WE SEE MORE INVESTMENT.

81
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:10,996
OUR JOB HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA IS

82
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:18,737
TO BRING ABOUT THOSE

83
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:19,471
DEPRECIATION CHANGES AND MAKE

84
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,439
THEM APPLICABLE AT THE STATE

85
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:20,872
LEVEL AS WELL.

86
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:21,974
THERE SIGNIFICANT EXCITEMENT

87
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:22,341
OVER THAT.

88
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:23,709
OVERMUCH OF THE DEREGULATION

89
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:23,942
OVERMUCH OF THE DEREGULATION.

90
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:24,843
>>LELAND: DO YOU SEE EMPLOYERS

91
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:26,511
AND REMEMBERS LINKING ALL OF

92
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:37,055
THAT THAT'S HAPPENING

93
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,457
AND REMEMBERS LINKING ALL OF
THAT THAT'S HAPPENING AND

THE REASON WE ARE DOING IT IS

102
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:48,633
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

103

WE HAVE MORE WORK, THE REASON

104
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:50,736
IS BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

105
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,137
ARE THEY MAKING THAT LINK?

106
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,171
>> I THINK THEY'RE MAKING IT

107
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,406

TAX REFORM ACT.

111
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:58,143
DEREGULATION CHANGES HAVE BEEN

112
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:05,517
VERY POSITIVE.IF THAT BECOMES

TRUMP.THEY ARE DIRECTLY TYING

115
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,353
IT TO ISSUES MORE SO THAN

116
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:09,021
ANYTHING ELSE.

117
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,322
>>LELAND: GIVE ME A SENSE OF

DOING.

120
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,894
ARE YOU SEEING CANDIDATES LINE

121
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:16,928
UP BEHIND THE SAME ISSUES AS

122
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:17,729
THEIR FIGHTING IT OUT IN THE

123
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,063
PRIMARY?

124
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,364
>> YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF

125
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:19,664
THAT.

126
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:28,140
HOW THAT BEARS OUT DEPENDS ON

127
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,074
WHETHER IT'S A REPUBLICAN OR

128
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:29,741
DEMOCRAT PRIMARY.

129
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,642
WE ARE VERY KEEN ON WATCHING

130
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:31,410
THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS.

131
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,577
THE STATE HOUSE SEAT SPECIAL

132
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:39,251
ELECTION IN THE AREA AND THE

133
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,652
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL HELD BY

134
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:41,453
DEMOCRATS FOR OVER HALF A

135
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:41,787
CENTURY.

136
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:42,521
IT WILL BE A VERY TOUGH FIGHT

137
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:42,921
THERE.

138
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:43,889
THERE'S A STRONG REPUBLICAN

139
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:44,222
RUNNING.

140
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,223
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

141
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,458
IF THE REPUBLICAN CAN TAKE A

142
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,159
SEAT AT THE STATEHOUSE LEVEL

143
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,795
WHAT ABOUT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

144
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,863
MANSION?

145
00:03:51,863 --> 00:04:01,073
>>LELAND: YOU SEE THEM DUKING

146
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:01,940
IT OUT WITH INCREDIBLY TOUGH

147
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,407
ADS.

148
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:03,141
DO YOU WORRY THAT THE

149
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:04,042
REPUBLICANS WILL BE WEAKENED

150
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,410
AND YOU WILL HAVE A SHOT AT THE

151
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:05,944
GOVERNOR'S MANSION?

152
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:11,149
>> CERTAINLY A LOT OF MONEY HAS

153
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,050
BEEN SPENT IN THE REPUBLICAN

154
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,384
PRIMARY.

155
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,351
TWO OF THEM ARE LARGELY SELF

156
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:14,219
FUNDING WHERE THE THIRD HAS HAD

157
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,153
TO SCRAP AROUND FOR DOLLARS.

158
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:16,353
IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN

159
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:16,855
INTERESTING RACE.

160
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:22,894
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE

161
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:23,895
WINNER OF THE PRIMARY COMES OUT

162
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:24,463
AFTER TUESDAY.

163
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:25,397
BUT AGAIN, A LOT OF MONEY HAS

164
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:26,565
BEEN SPENT OVER THE LAST FEW

165
00:04:26,565 --> 00:00:00,000
MONTHS.
