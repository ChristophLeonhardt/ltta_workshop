baby @qr faizon whooped our
just destroys the planet oh no no oh no
we got separated whoa whoo now what do I
people say that's good okay
I've enjoyed this oaf all my years
fighting crime I've learned one truth
that every villain is the hero of his
own story whoo Superman was no exception
The Joker drugged him tricked him into
killing his pregnant wife Lois and made
him trigger the bomb that neut
metropolis Superman code that's why so
and Superman killed the Joker I
understood why we all did but once that
line was crossed
there was no going back I think that's
Batman he gave himself and the Justice
League a new mandate stop all crimes
before it happened by any means
necessary but he couldn't see his good
intentions were leaving him down a path
of tyranny and evil evil that's our
greatest hero the king our greatest
threat
oh shit yet Superman's evil in this game
I heard several years ago the what a few
mescaline criminals at Arkham
they're the worst of the worst he's
going to kill them Damian
sounds like justice to me killing will
is injustice but Superman can't see that
he's grieving he needs time to heal
yeah what if it had been Gotham if Joker
had killed me your own son what Jo
Robert my son Robert I'll give a shit
about you no one Michael you are almost
out you see who Robin is okay it is
subsidies available now regarding we're
being taken to the backing which being
taken oldest reject prepare to eject
yeah could Superman evil in this game i
think i think what assess what the
story's about are we going to fight
Superman and cool

that for my videos I did it inside warm
I can't get me for example with Mahoning
hahaha there goes promise dispel to say
stupid okay I think we're gonna buy name
shut so yeah which one I won't hurt you
unless I have what others are you yeah
you're gonna have friends with
metropolis Batman Starfire
Beast Boy God bloody should enough we do
this sad never happen to see what you're
running to be angry oh but it's not a
blank check
oh and the Justice League isn't in depth
it ain't against was cyborg

arrey with his red eyes I could I could
never imagine Superman being evil

just wants to kill people and flat nine
dozen only minutes two minutes
are we going to fight Superman I think
we all got so cold you're better than
this Clark preparedness these inmates
are irredeemable they're thieves rapists
murderers like the Joker that's the
problem with fighting for truth and
justice the battle never ends and
executing them will end it first Joker
now this when does it stop it when
there's no more crime when people can
live without fear we want the same thing
Bruce I wanted to kill my parents
murderer I could have but that's not the
life they wanted for me oh and it's not
the life Lois would one for you don't
