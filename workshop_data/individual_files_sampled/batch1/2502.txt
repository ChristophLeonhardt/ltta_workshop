our guest today is John Mauldin I think despite Friday's encouraging jobs report is still not spectacularly optimistic about the near term for the economy but certainly optimistic long-term John does the jobs report on Friday that change your outlook for a muddle through at all if we have a jobs report like this for the next three months yeah in the sense of its more it'll I'll become more optimistic but I still think we're going to muddle through uh in the sense that we're going to have a double-dip recession i agree with uriel but i think it's because of taxes the tax increase is just going to be so huge and it is the tax increase that's embedded indicated in two thousand elects and their ol law and they're going to give us another four or five percent on the top in on that precisely on the people who create jobs the small businesses I mean that's not their target but that's what happens and so you're taking money out of the private sector and that's and putting into the public sector which has no multiplier a tax cuts Christina Romo I mean Obama's own person says it you have a 3x multiplier on Texas forgotten that man she's forgotten yet old history and so now you're going to have a negative 3x on on the tax increase so do you think there's any chance Congress says you know what things are so perilous that we're going to postpone that a few years or is a done deal that taxes are going up do you think pelosi and reid are going to say well we want to keep the bush tax cuts really yeah i don't think there's any chance now could we in some future world maybe get back to that maybe but I doubt it because we're going to be in pretty serious financial straits as a country for quite some time and there's not going to be this you know with the big deficits it's going to be difficult I think to start arguing that we need to cut taxes in order to decrease the deficit and so what do you when does this actually hit the economy because this is 2011 events 2011 only smooth sailing all through tooth doesn't end especially with it is I think it's low growth economy one or two percent I hope it is but and and that's the problem it's going to be a slow growth economy and then we're going to punch it with this big tax cut normally the quarter after the recession ends and people are saying the recession has ended you see a seven percent spike in GDP well they're going to revise this last quarter down to two and a half percent spike when they do the next revision that's not a robust recovery at all and the jobs today doesn't change that or friday doesn't change no I mean eventually you get to the place where um we start growing again I mean it's I'm not a falling off the world gloom and doom er I mean we're just we're finally finding the bottom we're trying to find you know the new normal wear that shifts too thanks John
