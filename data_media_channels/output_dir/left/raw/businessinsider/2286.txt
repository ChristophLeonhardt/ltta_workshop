1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,769
so but what is it every<font color="#E5E5E5"> foursquare</font>

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,049
sounds just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter it's just a way</font>

3
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:10,490
of people communicating back and forth

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,869
you don't know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put ads on it</font>

5
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:13,250
everything else why are you actually

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,379
optimistic i think the my love for

7
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,660
square<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the major difference here</font>

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,450
is that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Foursquare the relationship</font>

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,150
is between a person and a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,220
go to a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> you check in you see</font>

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,920
what other people are at that business

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">groupon you know it's you want a product</font>

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,089
you get together<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a group of people</font>

14
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:36,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">you buy a product from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a business the</font>

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,870
difference is on facebook or twitter the

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,699
relationship is between people which

17
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:41,989
I've just that's what I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always said</font>

18
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:43,309
you know relationships between people

19
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,589
are hard to monetize where relationships

20
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:47,390
between people and information or people

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,220
and businesses are much easier to

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,309
monetize I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very bullish on on groupon</font>

23
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Foursquare I think they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both the</font>

24
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,589
great platforms that they're fun to use

25
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,680
and and it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for businesses</font>

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,150
which means they're gonna flock to it so

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually think that foursquare could</font>

28
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:05,960
become a powerful absolutely i think you

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,240
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the longest time I you know I</font>

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,579
think dennis and his team have have been

31
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about this time you know when</font>

32
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,899
everybody would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device in their</font>

33
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,719
hand that would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to execute on</font>

34
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,859
the vision they had back at dodgeball

35
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,369
and even before that so you know III

36
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:25,009
think it's it's perfect timing the

37
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:26,659
businesses are ready you know local

38
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,070
businesses are ready to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

39
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how to use this stuff I mean if</font>

40
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,670
there's any risk in it it's that it

41
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,710
takes a long time for local businesses

42
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,899
to get ramped up on new advertising

43
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:37,999
modalities you know that's a risk but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

44
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,399
but the but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> logic is so clear for</font>

45
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:41,329
them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when someone's blocking</font>

46
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:43,819
your business is saying I'm here you're

47
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna wanna to transact with them so I I</font>

48
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:48,380
do think that you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> groupons</font>

49
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,060
already a fairly big business and

50
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,340
seemingly a very profitable one again we

51
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,469
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but I'm so groupon just</font>

52
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:55,939
raised a boatload of money huge

53
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:58,219
valuation to what we understand as we

54
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,829
are talking foursquare<font color="#CCCCCC"> is rumored to be</font>

55
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,170
hot and hidden with both raising money

56
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,209
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly getting an offer from yahoo</font>

57
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,030
in cash for 125 million dollars you've

58
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,470
been there as the entrepreneur what

59
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,940
should dentists do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you should</font>

60
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,380
sell the company I you know it's

61
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,590
whenever if once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take</font>

62
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,599
capital once you take venture capital

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,450
your world changes you become you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

64
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,030
fiduciary to your investors and your

65
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,120
investors are fiduciaries to you know we

66
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,739
manage money for the public school

67
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,120
teachers of New Mexico you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when</font>

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,050
we're doing that that's a big

69
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,940
responsibility and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dennis</font>

70
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,319
and his team are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a position where I</font>

71
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,060
think that they owe it to the investors

72
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,709
whose<font color="#E5E5E5"> money they took and and to</font>

73
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,629
themselves to take a good deal when it's

74
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,269
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think yahoo you know is in a</font>

75
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,790
better place than then you know

76
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,830
obviously things have been complicated

77
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">over there but I think now they're</font>

78
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,069
they've sort of stripped away a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

79
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,750
this lot of the bureaucracy and I think

80
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,250
that that team could potentially

81
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,019
flourish in Saudi yahoo and I'm sure

82
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if they do the deal you know Dennis</font>

83
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,940
and and and the investors there you know

84
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,799
Fred Wilson will make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deal</font>

85
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,420
is one that allows the team to continue

86
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,400
to flourish and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the product continue</font>

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,629
to grow because it's a great product

88
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,250
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dennis already sold a company</font>

89
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,349
dodgeball<font color="#E5E5E5"> to google it was basically it</font>

90
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,060
immediately just ceased to exist you

91
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,560
don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that with Yahoo its</font>

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,849
companies have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> habit it's always</font>

93
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:15,980
drawing it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rescue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no but i</font>

94
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,989
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like o's didn't destroy</font>

95
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,049
tripod you know i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font>

96
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,069
negotiated the right deal with them and

97
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,900
we flourished inside of there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long</font>

98
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,030
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know once the key people</font>

99
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,519
left you know it was harder for for

100
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,709
tripa to continue but tripod still

101
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,049
exists today you know and still is a

102
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,630
fairly big service and and and still

103
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,060
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think is is innovating</font>

104
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,380
you know at a smaller level than the

105
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">other social networking so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if</font>

106
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,380
they negotiate the right deal with yahoo

107
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,079
if dennis and his team stick around the

108
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,579
service will grow and if they can grow

109
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,620
it to a point like we did with tripod

110
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,180
where it's sort of bigger than any one

111
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,069
person then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think even if they leave</font>

112
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,560
it'll continue inside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo for some</font>

113
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,419
period of time and a personal question

114
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,549
having built tripod sold it talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

115
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">it still around as a big service what's</font>

116
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that like to watch something that you</font>

117
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,590
created more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago you left</font>

118
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,180
more than five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago now I think</font>

119
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,819
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more maybe seven years ago what's</font>

120
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:08,900
it like sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> still having it out</font>

121
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,630
there somebody else is running it so the

122
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,579
scary thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and</font>

123
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,820
sold it 12 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so the five times</font>

124
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually a great feeling you</font>

125
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,630
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to see that tripod is still</font>

126
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">around and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people still use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

127
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,289
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear people say I've</font>

128
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:25,670
got a tripod account and

129
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,150
you know it's it's great and and you

130
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,680
