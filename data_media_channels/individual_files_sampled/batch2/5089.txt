these are very dishonest people many of them they are very very dishonest people fake news fake news they are fake they can make anything bad because they are the fake fake disgusting news those right there were just some of President Trump's attacks on the media over the past four months today in the lid the media responds to those attacks but the Boston Globe taking the lead and asking editorial boards from papers across the country to address the assault on the Free Press more than four hundred news outlets in 49 states responded with editorials in support of that case with us now is Linda Henry the Boston Globe's managing director the panel is also back Casey hunt Susanville / CEO and I am woody Mills Linda do you think this is a good idea or why do you think it's a good idea I do I think it's a good idea I think that this is sort of an unprecedented increase in rhetoric against the media and what this is doing is this allowed media outlets sort of galvanize them and their own words to explain why they matter and the response was really terrific and if you read them there's just a such a variety of voices in terms of you know a lot of media outlets we're connecting them to their community and saying we're fellow Americans we're your neighbors it's not the other the language that's being used is incredibly dehumanizing to say the enemy of the people it sees others is this other 'no stu remind citizens of the function of the press that's often taken for granted isn't it but can you argue that isn't it better to remind voters and citizens the function of a free press is just being a free press and and not not making yourselves a not a target but not calling attention to the president's allegations allegations of collusion by making it look like there's a coordinated effort to push back on him are you concerned about that well well that's definitely something that we thought about it but we have a choice so you know so we've been taking it it's been coming these tax on this increased rhetoric and this dangerous rhetoric has been increasing and we decided that we were going to respond and write about it and say that you know what there is a danger to this rhetoric and we reached out and invited others to join us and individual editorial boards made their own decision and again it was in their own words and so their response the choices do we do nothing it's not an option or to do something we chose to to do something again it is not an anti-trump it is a pro-constitution First Amendment discussion which is should not be controversial what do you think about this I think that we as journalists go out of our way to make sure that there is a distinction between our editorial pages and our news pages and the the attacks that the president is leveling at the media are undermining the American public's faith in their ability to find information that is true and that is at the root of the problem so from that perspective you know I while I you know commend the effort that they're doing you know that is not I think what we as reporters we're not we're not trying to argue they speak for us so it is a delicate balance and you saw the LA Times kind of give voice to that balance when they said hey we're not we're not actually going to participate in this but that said this is also a role for the editorial boards of newspapers in our countries they take stands on important issues all the time and you know that the coordination here I think does speak to kind of the degree of concern that we have at LA Times editorial let's read it the President himself already treats the media as a cabal enemies of the people he has called us suggesting over and over that we are in cahoots to do damage to the country the idea of joining joining together to protest him seems almost to encourage that kind of conspiracy thinking by the president and his loyalists why give them the ammunition to scream about collusion and then look at Trump's response today to all of this he says the Boston Globe which was sold to the failing New York Times for 1.3 billion dollars plus 800 million dollars in losses in investment or 2.1 billion dollars was then sold by The Times for $1 now the globe is in with other papers on free press prove it I mean I don't entirely understand that sweet I think the point is he's trying to say collusion the points the prove it isn't interesting I mean because it's not fake news is really new what Donald Trump means by that is news that is unfavorable to him and we all know that yeah but we don't say it enough and I think if each editorial would have taken a story that they wrote and Donald Trump at one point called some aspect of it fake news and said this is not fake this is real news that Donald Trump doesn't like well I also went message can't get hammered in enough to the American public we say it all the time yeah and I also wish that the news would do more to actually examine what are his motivations for attacking the press first of all fake news does not amuse right but let's be clear fake news is not a new term that Donald Trump made up he is taking a direct play out of Hitler's book Hitler came up with this idea of like old fake news and attacking the media and using this propaganda to try to essentially give cover to his regime what's it I wouldn't word it for it again Lou fan don't speak German I don't even want to butcher it the German word for that it certainly seen the page on Twitter that rallies and so if we so we I think yes thank you Russ so the media would would really do continue to continue to do a service by constantly looking at the motivation of the president talking about the history the patterns that he has and who he's taking his cues from he thinks that he has a regime or interesting way of doing it interpreting into context rather than I feel I worry that these discussions about about him attacking us end up being a little too navel-gazing and make the story too much about us and when I when I consider doing one of these segments I generally start to think of Marty Baron when Marty Baron was responding to the president saying that he's at war with the press Linda Marty Baron said and this is the the editor-in-chief of The Washington Post he said we're not at war we're at work we we are at work and I think you know I appreciate what was what the arguments are there but again this was what we are reiterating what would it that we stand for what the value what the role of a free press is and each individual newspaper wrote about what that meant to them and what a free press is in Boston is very different from what the Free Press is in Boise in terms of what it matter what the role that it plays within the zone so while we are all doing the same thing in terms of holding the powerful accountable keeping the citizenry informed but it means different things that plays out differently on a community level you know a lot of the editors that you're reading we're talking about how you know we care about the school board we care about the new restaurant that's opening we're interested in who the city selectmen are those sort of things on a very local level and when the rhetoric comes in from the top that this is fake news this is the enemy of the people it's it plays down all through all levels of journalism Susan well I think the Free Press is the same in Boston as it isn't Boise as it is in Los Angeles as it is in Florida and everywhere else a Free Press means the that they you have the freedom to report and the government is not there to oversee and prevent you from reporting that those are values that kind of work everywhere it also means that we have access to our public officials and institutions you know I care the capital every day so you know when they tried to say that we can't walk down X hallway or stand in Y corner all of us kind of go up and say hey this is not a this is not acceptable I mean that's a fight that we have you know on a daily basis excuse me we paid for this building well but it's also you know people have a right to they don't have access to their representatives yeah we do that's our job and it's important to protect that hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button
