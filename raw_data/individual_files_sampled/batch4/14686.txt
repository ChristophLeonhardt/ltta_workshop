and every once in a while they get a guilty pang and I don't know if they should but instead of actually amending their own life they scold us I want to show you I've got a bunch of tweets but let me focus on two one is by jared leto who did a sponsored tweet I don't know if you can tell this was sponsored by an automobile company and then we read it he says this earth the this earth they round up and donate take a lift ride and support World Wildlife Fund by opting in to round up your fare to the nearest dollar donating that difference big or small helps make a positive change for our planet and just for folks who don't know what lift is it's a competitor to uber so these folks have tens of thousands of gasoline burning cars on the road and this is an Earth Day moment I mean I can understand the argument well this is cheaper than having your own car or something like that but you've got to admire the hood spot of a car company so totally co-opting Earth Day and the World Wildlife Fund just accepting that those you know 25 cents 50 cents here I can't think of any tweet that shows the scam of this a millionaire celebrity showboat a Earth Day being co-opted by a car company and an environmentalist NGO happy to take the cash to put from any buy just I think that's perhaps the classic celebrity tweet ever it is it does show you because their agenda is absolutely against the cars as well I mean they're they're environmentalists right now we're fighting the Trump administration's efforts to rollback these average fuel economy standards for cars which would make Ashlyn size comfort and safety in cars so they're actually working against making your next uber or lyft ride safer because you're going to have a lighter car with government man unless the top administration succeeds but at the same time hey they're willing to promote car use and travel it's like Schwarzenegger recently said he wanted to sue fossil fuel companies for murder as he was hot at the same time Hocking free you know these promotional helicopter rides for people to go on that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
