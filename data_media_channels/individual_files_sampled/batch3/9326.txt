WE'LL SEE, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE COMING BACK TO THE TABLE TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CAPITOL HILL WEIGHING IN ON O CAPITOL HILL WEIGHING IN ON CAPITOL HILL WEIGHING IN ON H CAPITOL HILL WEIGHING IN ON E CANCELED SUMMIT AS WELL. JOINING ME NOW, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA JOE WILSON, A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, ALSO ONE OF TWO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAS ACTUALLY BEEN TO PYONGYANG, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. SHANNON, I APPRECIATE OUR SHARED VIRGINIA HERITAGE. Shannon: YES, WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TODAY. CHRISTIAN REPORTED ON IT AND HAD SOME PASSAGES. INCLUDING THIS ONE AS WELL. THE PRESIDENT SAYS, YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES, BUT OURS EVER SO MASSIVE AND POWERFUL THAT I PRAY TO GOD THEY WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE USED. DO YOU THINK THEY WERE CARROTS AND STICKS IN THIS LETTER. WHAT WORKS BETTER WITH NORTH KOREA? WHAT ICS PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IF THE NEGOTIATIONS COULD LEAD TO DENUCLEARIZATION, THE REMOVAL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THAT HE WOULD WITHDRAW. IN FACT, THIS WEEK, WE KNOW THAT THE NORTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER ACTUALLY ISSUED A THROAT AND SO THE PRESIDENT I THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENW THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENE THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENS THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENE THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENT THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENA THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENT THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENE THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENR THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENS THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENO THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENS THAT NORTH KOREA ACTUALLY SAYS WE'LL MEET ANYTIME, ANYWHERE. Shannon: IS INTERESTING HOW QUICKLY THAT TURNED AROUND, COMING FROM THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER TONIGHT, SAYING, THIS ISN'T THE WAY WE THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO GO, LET'S GET BACK TOGETHER AND KEEP TALKING. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT THE LEFT HAS JUMPED ON THIS? WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER, SAYING, HE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE A NOBEL PRIZE, HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. EVEN SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE LEFT HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE GLAD THE PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY, THE RIGHT THING FOR HIM TO DO. HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. THE GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE HAVE THE LEADERSHIP OF SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO, AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON, AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY. A TEAM IN PLACE THAT WILL PROTECT AMERICAN FAMILIES. Shannon: I WANT TO READ THE STATEMENT WE ARE GETTING FROM THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, THE FIRST VICE FOREIGN MINISTER. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TONIGHT. "THE ABRUPT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CANCELLATION OF THE MEETING IS UNEXPECTED FOR US. WE CANNOT BUT FIND IT EXTREMELY REGRETTABLE. WE AGAIN STATED TO THE U.S. OUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT FACE-TO-FACE AT ANY TIME, IN ANY FORM, TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM." HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE OR DOES THIS GET BACK ON TRACK? DOES THE JUNE 12TH DAVE TOLD? TO THE HOLD OUT FOR A BIT? WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? AGAIN, THE GOOD NEWS, WHETHER IT BE JUNE 12 THERE WERE NEVER COME OF THE DOOR IS STILL OPEN. THERE'S ALREADY BEEN AN ACHIEVEMENT, THE RELIEF OF RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES, I AM SO PROUD OF DONALD TRUMP AND THE DIFFERENCES HE IS MAKING FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. Shannon: HE DID THINK THE NORTH KOREANS IN HIS LETTER VERY NICELY, SAYING IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING THEY HAD DONE ALLOWING THE AMERICANS TO COME HOME. THERE WAS A LOT OF PRAISE FOR HIM IN THIS LETTER AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HOUSE MINORITY LEADER CONGRESSWOMAN NANCY PELOSI ACTUALLY MADE FUN OF. SHE SAID THAT KIM JONG UN MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE FIT READING THIS LETTER, IT WAS WAY TOO NICE, AND ALSO A VALENTINE TO THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER. I THINK IT WAS A WELL-WRITTEN LETTER. I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SO DIPLOMATIC. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE HAVE A LEADER WHO IS PROTECTING AMERICAN FAMILIES. TODAY'S A BIG DAY IN THE NATIONAL DEFENSE ORGANIZATION ACT WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS, WE REBUILDING THE MILITARY AGAIN, THE CONGRESS LIVING UP TO HIS PROMISES TO REBUILD THE MILITARY, PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. Shannon: YOU HAVE SEEN A VIDEO OF THE SUPPOSED DEMOLITION OF THE NUCLEAR TEST SITE, IT WAS SAID THAT THERE WERE COLLAPSING AND TUNNELS ON THE BUILDING UNDERNEATH US. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? DO YOU THINK THAT IS A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ASSESS THAT? WE DON'T HAVE EXPERTS ON THE SITE. WE DON'T HAVE FULL VERIFICATION. THAT IS ENCOURAGING, TOO. WHO WOULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED, WE ALREADY KNOW THE FAR LEFT WOULD HAVE DISMISSED THIS AS NOT BEING ABLE TO EVER OCCUR. WELL, WHATEVER OCCURRED, A STEP FORWARD, AND AGAIN, I'M GRATEFUL
