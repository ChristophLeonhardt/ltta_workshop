that's cuz I'm a little I was so afraid of Islamic state because they could have executed me if I try to escape so I had no other option but to stay Mahima manasa swara cathedra husband was threatening me that if i returned home he would apply me to the muslim religious police I stayed in Raqqa out of fear and I had nothing to do except wait for the Kreutz but they are cool if I'm charged I have nothing to be judged for because I have done nothing wrong Yani I would like to see our case is not drag on and I hope that the local authorities will be able to handle all problems concerning our repatriation to our home countries
