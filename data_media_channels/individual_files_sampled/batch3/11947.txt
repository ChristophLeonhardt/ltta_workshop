the International Olympic Committee has another situation on its hands in South Korea as reports emerge the IOC told the u.s. women's ice hockey team to remove the image of the Statue of Liberty from its helmets the rules state that no political symbols can be displayed on athletes uniforms all the reports that Lady Liberty was being given the cold shoulder by the IOC quickly made headlines and sparked outrage online with some media suggesting national flags and anthems might as well be removed to another jeevan's cited reports suggesting it was the Russian president who requested the Olympic Committee get the u.s. to remove the image people on Twitter echoed the media's criticism of the move some accused the IOC of bias saying it doesn't mind sponsor money and logos such as the famous Nike tick others questioned of Canada should therefore remove the iconic maple leaf it's national symbol from jerseys and equipment however the IOC has backtracked saying it was a misunderstanding and that it never asked the US team to remove the Statue of Liberty we discussed all that with sports studies and sociology professor Ellis Cashmore he thinks elite competitions are now more about politics than the sport itself I do find it absolutely ridiculous that the Olympics is now trying to stamp out any kind of reference to nationalism the whole point of the Olympics was originally at least in the the late 19th century when the modern Olympic started to bring nations together over the years what has happened is that the Olympics have been hijacked in one way or another by political interest groups sometimes whole governments I don't think you can keep politics out of the Olympics any more than you can keep politics out of sport generally this whole Russian doping business has just escalated and escalated to the point where Russians have been eliminated disqualified from competition that is in itself a political decision and we've seen this whole narrative that's been gone on for a very long time
