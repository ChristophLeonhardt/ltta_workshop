00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,430
PRESIDENT'S OWN STRONG LANGUAGE

77
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,633
WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICIZED AND,

78
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,067
SOME HAVE SUGGESTED IF IT WAS

79
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,470

WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?

83
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,480
I WOULD SAY THAT A PERSON THAT

84
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,448
RECOGNIZES ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE,

85
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,117
ANY THREAT OF VIOLENCE CANNOT BE

86
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:47,451
TOLERATED BY THIS COUNTRY.

87
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:50,288

VIOLENCE AND WE TRACKED DOWN ALL

91
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,061
INSTANCES OF THAT, WHEREVER THEY

92
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:58,696
APPEAR AND WHATEVER THE MOTIVE

93
00:02:58,697 --> 00:02:58,963
IS.

94
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,465
WHETHER IT'S POLITICAL OR NOT

95
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:01,832

97
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:06,270
TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY AND

98
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,104
DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES, SO WE

99
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,272
CAN'T STAND FOR IT.

100
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,408
WE MUST BRING THESE PEOPLE TO

AGREE THAT IT HAS BEEN A

105
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:20,451
INTERVENING FACTOR?

106
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:21,285
>> Sec. Nielsen: I THINK HE

107
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,387
MADE CLEAR WHAT HE WANTS AND

108
00:03:23,388 --> 00:00:00,000
EXPECTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
