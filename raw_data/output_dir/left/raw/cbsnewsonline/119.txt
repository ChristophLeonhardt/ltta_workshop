NOT -- IT DIDN'T SHOW THAT. 

81

IT WAS APPARENTLY MOVING AT A 

82
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,270
HIGHER RATE OF SPEED FROM WHAT 

83

DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS. 

85
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,008
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO 

86
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,511
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THE 

87
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:28,147

88
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,748

LIFE JACKETS ON IT? 

93
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:33,953
>> YES. 

94
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,921
>> ARE THE PASSENGERS REQUIRED 

95
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,690
TO WEAR THEM? 

96
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:37,991
>> NO. 

97

UNDER LAW THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED 

98
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,961
TO WEAR THEM. 

99
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:42,662
AND USUALLY THE LAKE IS VERY 

100
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,895
PLACID. 

101
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,464
AND IT'S NOT A LONG TOUR. 

102
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,199
THEY GO IN AND KIND OF ON 

103
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,834
AROUND THE ISLAND AND BACK. 

104
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,336
AND WE HAD OTHER BOATS IN THE 

105
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:50,737
WATER EARLIER. 

106
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,672

>> IF THE BOAT -- SHOULDN'T 

110
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,645
HAVE BEEN ON THE WATER, IS THIS 

111
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,482
THE KIND OF THING FOR WHICH THE

JACKETS WERE ON BOARD THE DUCK 

740
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,198
BOAT BUT PEOPLE BY LAW ARE NOT 

741
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,566
REQUIRED TO WEAR THEM IN 

742
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:54,833
MISSOURI. 

743
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,968
ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF DUCK 

744
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,070
BOATS IS THE MYRIAD OF FOLKS 

745
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,770
THAT REGULATE THEM. 

746
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,370
THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION 

747
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,004
SAFETY BOARD HAS JURISDICTION 

748
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,106
WHEN THEY'RE ON THE ROAD. 

749
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,975
THE COAST GUARD ON THE WATER. 

750
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,678
CITIES AND STATES HAVE THEIR 

751
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,078
OWN REGULATIONS. 

752
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:08,814
SO WOULD LIFE VESTS IF 

753
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,815
EVERYBODY HAD BEEN WEARING THEM 

754
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,615
MADE A DIFFERENCE? 

755
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:11,416
YOU KNOW THERE'S THE ENCLOSURE 

756
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,119
ON THE TOP OF THE DUCK BOAT. 

757
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,955
COULD THAT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE 

758
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:17,622
FOR PEOPLE GETTING SNOUT THAT'S 

759
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:18,256
ALL THE STUFF -- OUT? 

760
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,492
THAT'S ALL THE STUFF THE 

761
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,126
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY 

762
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,493
BOARD WILL BE LOOKING AT. 

763
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,863
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IN THE 

764
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:25,230
PAST 20 YEARS. 

765
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,133
SOME ON LAND AND SOME ON WATER. 

766
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,467
AND CERTAINLY THESE BOATS DO 

767
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,701
HAVE THEIR CRITICS. 

768
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,037
>> YEAH NOW YOU SAID YOU WERE 

769
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,338
GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 

770
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:33,638
ABOUT THEM. 

771
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,073
IF YOU LIVE IN SORT OF A BIG 

772
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,741
CITY WITH WATER AROUND IT. 

773
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,645
YOU PROBABLY HAVE ONE OF THESE 

774
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,412
DUCK BOATS TOURING TOURISTS 

775
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:41,779
AROUND THERE. 

776
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:42,581
AND AMPHIBIOUS AND DRIVE ON THE 

777
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,383
STREET AND THEN THEY ENTER INTO 

778
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,316
THE WATER. 

779
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:45,817
YOU ARE RIGHT. 

780
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,718
EVEN THOUGH THE OWNER OF THE 

781
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,853
DUCK BOAT SAID NOTHING LIKE 

782
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,688
THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE, 

783
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,723
MAYBE NOT YOU KNOW, IN 

784
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,126
MISSOURI, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY 

785
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,961
HAPPENED BEFORE IN OTHER 

786
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:56,662
CITIES. 

787
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,229
SOMETIMES MISHAPS ON THE WATER. 

788
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,731
SOMETIMES MISHAPS ON THE LAND. 

789
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,300
GIVE US AN IDEA OF JUST HOW 

790
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,935
THIS VEHICLE OPERATES. 

791
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:04,202
>> SURE. 

792
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,471
SO THE DUCK BOAT WAS BUILT IN 

793
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,374
THE 19 -- DESIGNED IN THE 19s. 

794
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,642
IT'S A WORLD WERE -- 1940s. 

795
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,778
IT WAS A WORLD WAR II PIECE OF 

796
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,679
MILITARY EQUIPMENT USED TO MOVE 

797
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,615
TROOPS ON THE GROUND AND ON 

798
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,317
WATER. 

799
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,152
THEY HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN SOME 

800
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,422
CASES EXPANDED SINCE THE YEARS 

801
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:23,655
SINCE. 

802
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,657
PRIMARILY AS TOUR BOATS TRUCKS 

803
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,991
IN THE U.S. THEY'RE VERY 

804
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:27,258
POPULAR. 

805
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:29,695
OU SEE THEM IN BOSTON AND YOU 

806
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,532
SEE THEM IN WASHINGTON, NEW 

807
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,132
YORK. 

808
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:34,365
HAWAII. 

809
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:35,267
AND YOU KNOW, SO THAT THEY ARE 

810
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,067
OLD EQUIPMENT. 

811
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:38,270
ONE OF THE CRITICISMS IS ON 

812
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,040
LAND, BECAUSE THE DRIVER IS 

813
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,376
12012 FEET OFF THE -- 10 TO 12 

814
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,076
FEET OFF THE BOW. 

815
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,211
THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF ACCIDENTS 

816
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,512
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SEE. 

817
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,849
THEN IT'S HOW ARE THEY 

818
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,149
MAINTAINED? 

819
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,584
1999 THE HOT SPRINGS ARKANSAS 

820
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,053
SINKING OF A DUCK BOAT WHERE 13 

821
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,155
PEOPLE DIED. 

822
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,824
THAT WAS BLAMED ON INADEQUATE 

823
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:00,157
MAINTENANCE. 

824
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:01,626
2010 A DUCK BOAT STALLED ON THE 

825
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,393
DELAWARE RIVER IN PHILADELPHIA 

826
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,495
AND COLLIDED WITH A BARGE. 

827
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,997
THAT ACCIDENT WAS BLAMED ON THE 

828
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:08,834
TUG BOAT OPERATOR MATE THAT WAS 

829
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,467
PUSHING THE BARGE. 

830
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:09,968
HIS INATTENTION. 

831
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,369
BUT STILL TWO DIED IN THAT 

832
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:11,636
ACCIDENT. 

833
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,704
IN SAT UNTIL 2015 YOU REMEMBER 

834
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:14,673
ON LAND, A DUCK BOAT COLLIDED 

835
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,110
WITH A BUS ON A BRIDGE AFTER 

836
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,677
ITS AXLE BROKE. 

837
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:21,046
THE NTSB FOUND THAT THERE WAS A 

838
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,047
DEFECT IN THE AXLE IN SEATTLE. 

839
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,417
AND THE AXLE MANUFACTURER ENDED 

840
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,952
UP PAYING ABOUT $1 MILLION FINE 

841
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,687
FOR NOT REPORTING THAT 

842
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:28,954
PROPERLY. 

843
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,257
BUT FIVE PEOPLE DIED IN THAT 

844
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:32,524
ACCIDENT. 

845
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:32,891
BOSTON IN 2017. 

846
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,658
INCREASED THEIR REGULATIONS 

847
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,660
AROUND DUCK BOATS WHICH ARE 

848
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,461
VERY POPULAR IN BOSTON OF 

849
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,231
TORNADO WATCH FATAL -- OF TWO 

850
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,131
FATAL ACCIDENTS ON LAND. 

851
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,666
SO THERE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN 

852
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,703
ACCIDENTS THESE VEHICLES, THEY 

853
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:49,841
ARE UNIQUE WAYS TO TRANSPORT 

854
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,074
PEOPLE. 

855
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,909
AND THEIR DESIGN DATES BACK TO 

856
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,044
WORLD WAR II. 

857
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:53,345
>> RIGHT. 

858
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,112
KRIS VAN CLEAVE THANK YOU SO 

859
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:54,312
MUCH. 

860
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,815
ON THE PHONE WITH ME NOW IS 

861
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,649
FORMER NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION 

862
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,685
SAFETY BOARD CHAIRMAN AND CBS 

863
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:02,187
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MARK ROSENCUR. 

864
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,488
OKAY MARK YOU CAN WALKS THROUGH 

865
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,091
HOW THIS INVESTIGATION IS GOING 

866
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,858
TO PROCEED MOVING FORWARD. 

867
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:11,229
THIS IS A LARGE LAKE. 

868
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,263
WE HEARD THAT ONCE THIS BOAT 

869
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:15,700
SANK IT SORT OF SANK IN WATER 

870
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,137
THAT WAS ABOUT 40 FEET DEEP AND 

871
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,872
THEN IT ROLLED INTO 80-FOOT 

872
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:21,172
DEEP WATER. 

873
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:22,674
SO THIS IS A VERY DEEP, DEEP 

874
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:22,874
LAKE. 

875
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,110
SO GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT'S 

876
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,477
HAPPENING NOW. 

877
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,946
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOUR 

878
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:28,446
PEOPLE STILL MISSING. 

879
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:31,148
THIS HAS BECOME A RECOVERY 

880
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:31,449
OPERATION. 

881
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,318
NO LONGER A REST CUE OPERATION. 

882
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:33,918
>> -- RESCUE OPERATION. 

883
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:34,986
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND 

884
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:35,953
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THIS MANY 

885
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:39,157
PEOPLE DIE, OF COURSE THE NTSB 

886
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,691
WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE LEAD 

887
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,127
AGENCY HERE IN BEING SUPPORTED 

888
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,995
BY THE UNITED STATES COAST 

889
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,530
FORWARD AND THE LOCAL -- GUARD 

890
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,964
AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 

891
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:48,766
GET THAT VESSEL UP AS QUICKLY 

892
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:52,571
AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO BEGIN 

893
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,104
THEIR EXAMINATION. 

894
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:53,705
THEIR FORENSIC EXAMINATION. 

895
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,106
AND ALSO BE LOOKING AT 

896
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,142
MAINTENANCE, THEY'LL BE LOOKING 

897
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,844
AT SURVIVAL FACTORS AND THE 

898
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,111
WEATHER. 

899
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,411
ACCIDENTS ARE NEVER ONE THING. 

900
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,613
THEY'RE A COMBINATION OF EVENTS 

901
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,448
THAT LEAD TO A CATASTROPHIC 

902
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:03,715
ENDING. 

903
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,483
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING 

904
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:06,151
HERE. 

905
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,419
>> I THINK ANYBODY SEEING THE 

906
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,855
VIDEO WOULD BE STUNNED. 

907
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,455
PARTICULARLY THAT VIDEO WAS 

908
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,191
TAKEN ON CELL PHONE IN THE 

909
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,827
MIDST OF THE STORM WOULD BE 

910
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:16,527
STUNNED BY THE INTENSITY OF THE 

911
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:17,495
STORM AND THE FIRST QUESTION IS 

912
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:19,764
WHY WERE THEY IN THE WATER AT 

913
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:20,165
ALL? 

914
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,299
ARE THE CAM TAPES REQUIRED -- 

915
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,334
CAPTAINS REQUIRED OR ANYONE 

916
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,034
WHERE THE BOAT, REQUIRED TO 

917
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:23,935
CHECK -- WITH THE BOAT, 

918
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,236
REQUIRED TO CHECK THE FORECAST 

919
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:25,837
AHEAD OF TIME? 

920
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,672
>> ABSOLUTELY, THEY'RE WORKING 

921
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,307
ON LOOKING AT WEATHER AND 

922
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,776
THEY'RE WORKING ON DISPATCH AT 

923
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,943
THE FACILITY WHERE IN FACT 

924
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,512
THESE BOATS ARE BEING LAUNCHED. 

925
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,146
CLEARLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE A 

926
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,281
LOT -- THERE ARE GOING TO BE A 

927
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,015
LOT OF QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT 

928
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:37,782
WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THE 

929
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:38,917
WEATHER AND WHEN THAT I HADDY 

930
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,751
KNOW ABOUT THE WEATHER -- DID 

931
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,752
THEY KNOW ABOUT THE WEATHER AND 

932
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,320
DID THEY CONTACT THE VESSEL 

933
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,322
WHEN IT WAS OUT? 

934
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,657
THOSE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE 

935
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,193
ANSWERED AND OF COURSE MANY 

936
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:48,893
OTHERS AS WELL. 

937
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:52,063
CERTIFICATION OF THE CAPTAIN 

938
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:52,396
AND THE CREW. 

939
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:53,565
THEY WILL ALSO LOOK AT THE 

940
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,967
CERTIFICATION OF THE VESSEL 

941
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:56,200
ITSELF. 

942
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,901
CLEARLY MAINTENANCE IS GOING TO 

943
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:57,335
BE LOOKED AT. 

944
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,703
THE RECORS ARE GOING TO HAVE 

945
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:02,440
TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE 

946
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,807
INVESTIGATORS. 

947
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:03,508
THE INVESTIGATOR IN CHARGE, 

948
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,508
HE'S A VERY SEASONED MARINE 

949
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,077
INVESTIGATOR AND HE WILL BE 

950
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,946
LEADING THIS TEAM WHICH WILL 

951
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,847
INCLUDE FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED 

952
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,216
IN LOOKING AT THE VESSEL 

953
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:12,450
ITSELF. 

954
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,385
AND SURVIVAL FACTORS OF COURSE 

955
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,253
GOING TO BE A MAJOR QUESTION 

956
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,188
THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED HERE 

957
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,089
AS WELL. 

958
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,624
>> MARK YOU KNOW, THE FORECAST 

959
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:23,161
-- ACCORDING TO AT LEAST 

960
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:23,829
OFFICIALS, WIN SPEEDS WERE 

961
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,597
ABOUT 63 MILES PER HOUR AT 

962
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,197
TIMES ON THIS LAKE. 

963
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:31,136
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DESIGN OF 

964
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,272
THIS VEHICLE/BOAT, WHAT IT WAS 

965
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,041
DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN? 

966
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,509
COULD IT SUSTAIN 63-MILE-PER-

967
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,476
HOUR WIND GUSTS? 

968
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,145
>> WELL, THESE DEVICES WERE 

969
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,781
ACTUALLY CREATED ALMOST 77 

970
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,281
YEARS AGO. 

971
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:46,718
NEARLY -- EIGHT DECADES IF YOU 

972
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:46,918
WILL. 

973
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:47,952
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED 

974
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:50,121
AS KRIS SAID BY THE UNITED 

975
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,223
STATES ARMY TO BE COMBINATION 

976
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:53,024
AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE THAT ENABLES 

977
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,794
IT TO OPERATE ON LAND, AND SEA. 

978
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,930
SO THEY WOULD FERRY THINGS LIKE 

979
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,031
AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES AND 

980
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,433
EQUIPMENT FROM OFFSHORE SHIPS 

981
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,733
TO THE BEACHES. 

982
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,703
SO THEY WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN 

983
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,870
OCEAN TYPES OF CONDITIONS. 

984
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,306
BUT AGAIN, WHEN YOU GET INTO 

985
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,842
THE HIGH GUSTS OF WIND AND THE 

986
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,079
WAY THEY'VE BEEN REDESIGNED TO 

987
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,814
CARRY PASSENGERS, THE QUESTIONS 

988
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,582
ASKED ABOUT THEIR CAPABILITIES 

989
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,651
IN THESE TYPES OF WEATHER 

990
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:19,951
CONDITIONS. 

991
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,286
>> JUST ONE LAST QUESTION FOR 

992
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:21,919
YOU MARK. 

993
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,054
IS THERE SOMETHING EQUIVALENT 

994
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,723
TO A BLACK BOX ON BOARD A BOAT 

995
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:26,023
LIKE THIS? 

996
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,226
>> I DON'T FEEL THAT THEY HAVE 

997
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,528
WHAT WE CALL A -- FLIGHT DATA 

998
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:30,761
RECORD. 

999
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:31,295
THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT I 

1000
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:33,198
BELIEVE FOR THAT TYPE OF 

1001
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:33,431
VESSEL. 

1002
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,699
BUT WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO PICK 

1003
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,101
THIS VESSEL BACK UP, THEY'RE 

1004
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,836
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE 

1005
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:38,803
CONDITION OF THE VESSEL. 

1006
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,072
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE 

1007
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:41,305
TO IT. 

1008
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:44,075
HOW THE WATER MAY HAVE GOTTEN 

1009
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,310
IN IT LOOKED LIKE POTENTIALLY 

1010
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,112
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SWAMPED. 

1011
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:49,948
WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 

1012
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,318
THE QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED 

1013
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,953
BY THE NTSB INVESTIGATORS BUT 

1014
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,622
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. 

1015
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:58,256
TYPICALLY A MAJOR INVESTIGATION 

1016
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,691
TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR AND IN 

1017
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:01,993
SOMETIMES 15 TO 18 MONTHS. 

1018
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,628
>> ALL RIGHT, MARK ROSENCUR 

1019
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:08,233
FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE NTSB, 

1020
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:08,700
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 

1021
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,136
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. 

1022
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,472
THE LATEST ON THIS MISSOURI 

1023
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,073
DUCK BOAT SINKING. 

1024
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:16,908
13 PEOPLE DEAD. 

1025
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,942
FOUR PEOPLE STILL MISSING. 

1026
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:20,578
WE KNOW THAT THE CAPTAIN OF 

1027
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,545
THIS BOAT SURVIVED. 

1028
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:22,580
BUT THE DRIVER DID NOT. 

1029
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,817
THIS VEHICLE HAS BOTH A CAPTAIN 

1030
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:26,484
AND A DRIVER. 

1031
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,286
THERE WERE LIFE VESTS ON BOARD. 

1032
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,621
BUT THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD, 

1033
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,157
NOT REQUIRED BY LAW TO WEAR 

1034
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:32,357
THEM. 

1035
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,758
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

1036
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,893
BREAK, MORE NEWS WHEN WE 

1037
00:26:34,893 --> 00:00:00,000
RETURN.
