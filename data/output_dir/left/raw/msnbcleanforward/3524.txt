51
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,990
everyone agrees<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that Rudy Giuliani</font>

52

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it speaks of truthfulness but I</font>

57
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,180
do think that the degree to which his

House has said<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that but what it</font>

103
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,420
does do is it echoes what Comey says in

104
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,109
the memos Comey laying out and while I

105
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,450
know the stormy Daniels thing is more

106
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,269
salacious that may<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually cut more to</font>

107
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,489
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question of obstruction well and</font>

108
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:52,540
it's it's

109
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,549
would you say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

110
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">closer to what Trump told Lester Holt</font>

00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">where he said that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Russia</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Russian thing right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean to</font>

114
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,549
Michael's point<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Rudy Giuliani coming</font>

115
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,890
closer to to that then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know because</font>

116
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">they obviously reversed and said no no</font>

117
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,680
it has nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right I</font>

118
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I think Giuliani tried to go back</font>

119
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say well under the president's</font>

120
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,820
powers he could fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever he wants</font>

121
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,810
that was never

122
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,370
under question but what was under

123
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,738
question was<font color="#E5E5E5"> intent and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that he</font>

124
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,480
really laid bare those intentions<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

125
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,940
interview with Lester Holt<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump said</font>

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,560
this Russia thing it had to go away<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of ambiguity over what</font>

128
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,610
exactly it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was what he had a problem</font>

129
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">with and now it really seems it's</font>

130
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,240
exactly like James Comey laid out it had

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,800
to do with Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't</font>

132
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,250
that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was trying to protect how all of</font>

133
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">these other people who could be indicted</font>

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously that was something coming</font>

that but I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if it was</font>

171
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,560
necessary yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

stormy Daniels I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip</font>

174
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,200
over the part where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">about why it would be necessary to pay</font>

in the context of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> investigation I</font>

179

180
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,780

to as they the prosecutors and the FBI

try to sort through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cohen's businesses</font>

payments to women<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's yes 130-thousand</font>

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,810

president these allegations are very

247
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,640
serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> on their own so the fact that</font>

248
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could be other women that may have</font>

249
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,890
come up that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all Giuliani</font>

250
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,270
doesn't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says something</font>

251
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship between Trump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,659

253
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,090
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> also the relationship between Cohen</font>

254
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,980
and Trump I mean if they were at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

255
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,240
where he would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really just paid</font>

256
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,860
these women off and never brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

257
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Trump's attention that shows it that</font>

258
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,210
this was a recurring<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean that</font>

259
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">but shouldn't be the thing that his</font>

00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,530
lawyer should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

261
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,940
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Giuliani saying that this</font>

262
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,950
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> common thing and he might not know</font>

263
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,960
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so I think that while the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

264
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,880
might seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> like not that big of a deal</font>

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would want to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about those</font>

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,120

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're putting yourself out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah and in Joyce Vance does does Rudy</font>

271
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,120
Giuliani's kind of you know he brought

272
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,290
this up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning because he</font>

273
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,670
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that this wasn't a</font>

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,860
violation of campaign finance law that
