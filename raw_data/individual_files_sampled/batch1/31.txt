frequently accusing the news media of not reporting on his accomplishments u.s. President Donald Trump brought reporters into the Oval Office to listen in real-time to a phone call with Mexico's president Thank You Andrea and congratulations together the two leaders jointly announced their breakthrough bilateral deal changing parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump says hurts US workers I like to call this deal the United States Mexico trade agreement I think it's an elegant name I think NAFTA has a lot of bad connotations for the United States because it was a ripoff the NAFTA agreement was signed 24 years ago between the United States Mexico and Canada it saw many manufacturing jobs move south to Mexico as a result where labor was cheaper one of the worst of trade deals ever on the campaign trail Trump promised to renegotiate NAFTA and bring back jobs particularly in the auto sector the new deal will require 75% of an American car to be made in Mexico or the United States up from 62 percent workers making those vehicles must also be paid a minimum 16 dollars an hour but missing from this latest agreement is Canada will start negotiating with Canada relatively soon they want to start they want to negotiate very badly relations between the two countries have been frosty since Trump's lapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum Canada's foreign minister will travel to the US this week to restart negotiations but it's not clear Canada will agree to the changes the NAFTA changes still need to be approved by the US Congress and follows weeks of negotiations between the United States and Mexico their agreement now puts pressure on Canada to remain a part of the pact Kimberley hellcat al Jazeera the White House
