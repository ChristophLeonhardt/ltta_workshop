Laura: THE MAJOR MEDIA ARE SELECTIVELY REPORTING THE FBI AND DOJ BRIEFING OF KEY LAWMAKERS LAST WEEK ABOUT THAT PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. WHILE TYPICAL OF TODAY'S SCREAMING HEADLINES, ABC BLARED GAUDI DISPUTES THE TRUMP SPY CLAIM AND SAYS FBI ACTED PROPERLY. BUT THAT IGNORES A NUMBER OF KEY POINTS THAT OVERSIGHT CHAIR GAUDI MADE ON FOX GLIDE LAST NIGHT. THE FIRST WAS THAT THE DOJ MADE CLEAR THAT TRUMP WAS NOT AND IS NOT A TARGET OF THE ADMINISTRATION. HE COULD NOT ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE FBI COULD NOT DO THAT DEFENSIVE BRIEFING OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF RELYING ON A FORM IT INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN. FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR ANDY McCARTHY LAID OUT HIS THEORY. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THEY SPIED ON THE CAMPAIGN. IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT A CORPORATION AND THEY THOUGHT THE CORPORATION WAS CORRUPTED BY THREE PEOPLE, YOU GO TO THE CEO AND YOU SAY, I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE. BUT THEY DIDN'T SAID INSTEAD WAS SEND COVERT OPERATIVES TO PRY INFORMATION OUT. Laura: THAT'S WHY THEY WERE UNHAPPY THAT GAUDI KIND OF MUDDY THE WATERS. ONE OF THEM IS DAN BONGINO OF NRA TV, AND ALSO JOINING US IS DANIEL GOLDMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IT'S GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU. DAN BONGINO, FIRST. LET'S GO TO YOU. WE INVITED GAUDI ON THE SHOW, AND WE WANT HIM TO COME ON BECAUSE HE'S A VERY SMART GUY. KIND OF CONFUSING HOW HE COMES ACROSS, BUT WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN ON SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE SPYGATE SITUATION? APPEARANCE IS NOW BEING USED AS PROPAGANDA BY THE LEFT, AND WHAT HE SAID WAS SO COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE AND FACTUALLY INCORRECT. LAURA, LET'S RUN THROUGH SOME BASIC FACTS. SO THE FBI RENTED BY THE BOOK, THE WAY AMERICANS WANTED HIM TO RUN THE INVESTIGATION. REALLY? THEN WHY DIDN'T THEY NOTIFY CONGRESS ABOUT FOR EIGHT MONTHS, WHEN PRIOR PROCEDURE WAS TO NOTIFY CONGRESS QUARTERLY ON SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS. ANOTHER QUESTION. IF THEY RAN IT BY THE BOOK, HOW IS IT THAT TWO SUSPICIOUS POTENTIALLY FELONY WEEKS OF INFORMATION HAPPENED IN BOTH OCTOBER AND JANUARY TO "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND "WASHINGTON POST"? IS THAT AN EXAMPLE, MR. GOWDY, OF A FINELY TUNED INVESTIGATION RUN THE WAY AMERICANS WOULD HAVE WANTED, HIDDEN FROM CONGRESS? HE DID NOTHING BUT FEED THE LEFTIST PROPAGANDA MACHINE YESTERDAY AND HE SHOULD GO BACK AND CLARIFY THOSE OUT OUTRAGEOUS, ABSURD REMARKS. Laura: I THINK HE'S OBSESSING OVER THE DEFINITION OF SPY WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE VERSUS AN INFORMANT IN AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION, WHICH I THINK IS BEYOND THE POINT. I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU A SOUND BITE FROM FROM JASON CHAFFETZ. IF JEFF SESSIONS IS THERE IN NAME ONLY, IS ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS. THE SOONER THE PRESIDENT NEEDS A NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE BETTER. HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER RECUSED HIMSELF, HE NEVER NEEDED TO ANY COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATION. Laura: THIS IS OF COURSE REGARDING THE TRUMP TWEET TODAY, COMMENTING ON WHAT GOWDY DID SAY WHICH MANY OF US TOOK NOTE OF, WHICH IS, YOU COULD HAVE THAT IN A TOP LAWYER BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. MEANWHILE, YOU PICK A GUY WHO EVERYONE LIKES BUT RECUSED HIMSELF RIGHT OFF THE BAT. FOR REACTION? I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DO HIS HOMEWORK A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE THIS WAS AN OBVIOUS RECUSAL UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REGULATION. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE TO HIM OR HIS LAWYERS. SO THE FACT THAT HE THEN ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS RECUSING HIMSELF, BECAUSE HE WAS AN INTEGRAL PLAYER IN THE CAMPAIGN AND THEREFORE COULD NOT OVERSEE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE. THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT I SEE AS A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR ABOUT THE WAY THAT TRUMP VIEWS SESSIONS AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS HE SEEMS TO BE TALKING A LOT ABOUT WANTING SOMEONE WHO IS LOYAL TO HIM. WHICH, ON ITS FACE IS FINE, HE GETS TO CHOOSE HIS CABINET, AND I GET THAT. BUT WHAT HE IS REALLY INDICATING AND EMPLOYING AND MAKING THAT STATEMENT IS THAT YOU WANT SOMEONE LOYAL TO HIM AT THE TOP OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHO WILL SQUASH AN INVESTIGATION INTO EITHER HIM, OR HIS CAMPAIGN, ASSOCIATES, CHILDREN, OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE. Laura: WAIT A SECOND. WAS ERIC HOLDER PERCEIVED TO BE LOW LOYAL TO BARACK OBAMA? I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE THAT ERIC HOLDER WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE LEFT IS NOW SAYING THAT TRUMP SHOULD NOW HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SESSIONS. SO I THINK THAT LOYALTY WENT REALLY DEEP BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, WHETHER IT WAS THE IRS INVESTIGATION, HOW THEY HANDLED FAST AND FURIOUS, HOW THEY DID THE ROADS AND OVERSIGHT, WHETHER THE PRESIDENT KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND WHETHER THEY WERE EVER BRIEFED ON IT. YOU COULDN'T GET INFORMATION OUT OF THESE PEOPLE SO I THINK LOYALTY MATTERED TO OBAMA OFF THE TOP OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. I THINK LOYALTY IN SOME RESPECTS MATTERS. THE PRESIDENTS WING MAN, THAT'S WHAT HE CALLED HIMSELF. WHILE I DON'T KNOW BUT WHEN TRUMP IS SAYING THAT HE WANTS LOYALTY, AS A FORMER ORGANIZED CRIME PROSECUTOR, I HEAR SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN WANTING SOMEONE WHO IS CLOSE TO HIM, WHO IS LOYAL TO HIM. THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE THAT I THINK YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE, BOTH OF YOU, IS THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SO WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, DAN, HE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. SO YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. Laura: WHILE HE IS ALSO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, OF THE GOVERNMENT. AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SO IF HE WANTED TO, HE COULD FIRE ANYONE HE WANTS. IS IT POLITICALLY APPROPRIATE? I THINK DANIEL GOLDMAN'S RIGHT, IT WOULDN'T BE POLITICALLY APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT. BUT IF HE WANTED TO GET RID OF COMEY, OR ROSENSTEIN WHO WAS A DISASTER FROM THE BEGINNING, HE COULD GET RID OF THEM. WE COULD GET RID OF SESSIONS IF HE WANTED. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THOUGH IS HE IS COMPLETELY ABOVE THE LAW AND HE COULD FIRE ANYBODY FOR CORRUPT PRACTICES. DAN, YOU ARE JUST MAKING STUFF UP NOW AND I WISH SHE WOULD STOP DOING THAT. YOU SAID BEFORE THAT, THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO QUASH THESE INVESTIGATIONS. I'M GUESSING YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF THE CASE BECAUSE, IT'S ALREADY OPEN SOURCE THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID MULTIPLE TIMES THAT IF THERE WAS A RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE ASSET IN HIS CAMPAIGN TRYING TO COMPROMISE HIS CAMPAIGN, HE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT IT. SO, DAN, YOU MAY BE HEARING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO RETRACT THAT. BUT WHO QUASH IS AN INVESTIGATION WELL ASKING THE FBI SIMULTANEOUSLY TO INVESTIGATE THAT. I WILL WAIT FOR YOUR ANSWER. Laura: I THINK HE WANTED TO BE FAIR AND HE WANTS AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO DOESN'T MELT WHEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" EDITORIAL BOARD GETS UPSET ABOUT A RECUSAL THAT HE NEVER HAD TO DO. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE WANTS AND WHAT MOST PRESIDENTS WANT. HE HAD TO DO IT UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REGULATIONS. Laura: NO HE DIDN'T. BECAUSE WHAT DID HE HAVE TO DO WITH RUSSIAN COLLUSION? HE HAD ZERO TO DO WITH IT. I THINK IT WAS CONVENIENT. I THINK IT HAD TO DO WITH IT THE FACT THAT HE WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THE CAMPAIGN WAS A SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATION. Laura: WAS STARTED WITH A RIDICULOUS INFORMANT WHO WAS TROLLING FOR GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT AND MONEY. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? Laura: YOU ARE SAYING JEFF SESSIONS WAS INTEGRALLY INVOLVED. THAT WAS A PRUDENTIAL DECISION THAT HE MADE AND I WOULD SAY I DON'T THINK IT WAS REQUIRED AT ALL. ALL RIGHT, READ THE RAGS, THEY ARE VERY CLEAR. Laura: HOW MANY OF THE OBAMA PEOPLE EVER RECUSED THEMSELVES, RARELY IF EVER? YES BUT OBAMA WAS NEVER INVESTIGATED. I'M JUST SAYING TO YOU IF THERE IS A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT THAT HAS INFORMATION OF WRONGDOING IN
