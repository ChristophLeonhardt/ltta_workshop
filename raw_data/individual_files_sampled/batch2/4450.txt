new information this morning about the safety and security of the US election system homeland security secretary Kirsten Nielsen says it is something the administration takes seriously I'd love to know how speaking after our closed-door meeting I think the president's been very clear that he agrees with the Intel community that the Russians did attempt to hack or otherwise through cyber means influence our election and he remains committed that's why we're here today it's somebody if it is something that the president takes so seriously I'd like to see where he issued a decree on Twitter on Sunday calling for an investigation into the investigation of Russian influence in his campaign late Monday the president met with the man responsible for overseeing that new investigation Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein along with FBI director Chris Rea so let me just make something clear the president did not ask for us to further investigate what Russia doing was doing to potentially try to influence with our last presidential election to see what Russia or other countries could potentially be doing to try to influence the next election with the president asked for was an investigation into the investigators who are looking into this I want to bring in NBC News intelligence and national security reporter my friend Kendall E nian and Harry sandack former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York Ken I don't even know how to ask this the secretary says the President does believe Russia tried to influence the election do we have any any evidence that the President does believe that and what action steps what people is he putting in place what budget is he approving to look into that because the last I checked I've heard him say it could be Russia it could be China it could be a 400 400 pound fat person on their bed absolutely stuff not only is there no evidence that he believes that there's a lot of evidence on the public record to the contrary for example the in talking about I it's it's really unclear I mean it's it's the party line the FBI director Christopher Rea testified under oath to Congress that he was never asked by President Trump to do anything specific about Russian election interfere the head of the National Security Agency our digital spy agency said essentially the same thing and we see no government effort no agency wide effort to tackle this issue of Russian election interference yes DHS is working with the states and trying to shore up their the basic cybersecurity but there is no effort on Russian social media interference and manipulation we're not seeing that we're seeing that the National Security Council has eliminated its position of cybersecurity coordinator the guy who is actually working on that before he was fired Tom Bossert he's not being replaced so it's really unclear we do know that the president is very concerned as you said about this investigation into Russian election interference but there's really no evidence that he's doing anything about actual Russian election interference so I hope that I am absolutely wrong here and Secretary Nielsen I invite you to come on television with me or any person working with her on this I would love to know where we are taking action for me it has been 327 days since the White House has agreed to sit down for any of the interviews I've requested and if I'm wrong on this and we are taking action I invite you to come sit here and explain it to us how our congressional Republicans have been asking for classified information and it looks like they're going to get it what do you think about that I don't think it's a good idea congressional oversight is important and when congressional oversight is conducted it's usually in a retrospective way so Congress can look at an investigation when it's over and ask these questions that's right and then make recommendations on top of this he's deeply involved he's got a whatever-it-is dog in this hunt it definitely seems that way and he's really inserting himself into the middle of the investigation we had a situation here where at first it seemed like the president's own lawyers were asking for information about the informant about the source of information and now it seems like in kind of a compromise measure there's going to be some sharing of information but maybe less than what was requested and with Congress rather than let's say with the president's own lawyers okay but we can say all the day long this doesn't sound good I mean Rudy Giuliani Rudy Giuliani went so far as to say congressional leadership deserves this in formation but he also said yes it would help the president defend himself against robert muller and we might say well that doesn't sound right but it's still happening and there's a report out that trump fundraiser Eliot Brody promised himself as excuse me he promoted himself as a back-channel to the White House to secure a billion dollars worth of business from Saudi Arabia and Qatar when I read these headlines of course oh my god it's unethical it's the swamp but when do these issues actually matter well one would think based on the fact that it's been reported that George nadir has been meeting with the mother investigators that at some point they'll be a reckoning here and the mother team has proceeded appropriately in a very secret way they make their statements not through leaks or press releases but through their indictments and court appearances and one would fairly expect that if Nader is cooperating if Brody has already become kind of a focus of interest because of his role in the Michael Cohen piece of the investigation that may be under investigation the Southern District of New York one would think that his time is coming okay then if we're saying his time is coming and we know there have already been indictments we know you've got people pleading guilty and flippin Allah I think just a week ago Paul Manafort son-in-law should we be less concerned that rod Rosenstein is pleasing the President and saying yes we'll look into this could he be simply walking a very difficult line because he's trying to buy more time for Robert Muller and he doesn't want to put the president in in in an absolute rage where he's gonna pull a Saturday night Massacre I think that's exactly what's happening it's easy from the perspective of people on the outside and I don't think that they're wrong who said why did he do this he should have just said no president we're not doing this at all there's nothing more information than we do he has more information than we do and he also picked I think an interesting middle ground he said let's refer this to the office of the inspector general that's a component of the Department of Justice that's independent from the political process and looks at allegations of wrongdoing by Department of Justice personnel so it's a perfect place to put this let them investigate it if the public reporting is right they'll come back and say there's nothing here but that'll months from now and the president will have perhaps moved on to other issues and in the meantime the investigation continues so I think he's walking a very fine line trying to avoid the interference with the investigation but also trying to avoid being fired there you have it all right can I apologize to you when my guest says you're exactly right I try to end on that high note and and Harry thank you sir hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube
