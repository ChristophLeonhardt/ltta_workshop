what's driving down the number of terrorist attacks the US State Department argues the force due to the near defeat of armed groups such as ISIL at the same time Americans again single out Iran as the leading state sponsor of continuing attacks so what now for the so-called Global War on Terror this is inside story hello and welcome to the program Hashim Alberta a fall by almost a quarter in the number of attacks by armed groups worldwide last year that's one of the conclusions of the US State Department's latest annual survey of mobile terrorism but Iran won't welcome another of the surveys highlights the Americans singling out the Iranians as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism the Iranians are accused of intensifying many conflicts especially in Afghanistan Bahrain Iraq Lebanon and Yemen and continued backing for militias such as Hezbollah the US government says Hezbollah fighters base 11 and have gone from strength to strength emboldened by the battlefield experience in Syria and the Americans accused Iran of undermining legitimate governments and American interests in the Middle East the report details a worsening of war in Afghanistan and coordinated attacks by the Taliban and its affiliated Haqqani network some were launched from Pakistan which provoked the u.s. to recently cut three hundred million dollars in security aid let's take a look at the reports other findings the US State Department says there were about 8,500 what it caused terrorist attacks around the world last year the attacks killed 18,000 700 people the Americans attribute the 23 percent year-on-year for in the number of deaths to victories against ISIL and improved security in Iraq despite that ISIL remains active and carried out attacks in 20 countries last year more than half of all attacks by armed groups including ISIL al Qaeda and the Taliban were in just five countries Afghanistan India Iraq Pakistan and the Philippines the 15 month-long saudi-led dispute with Qatar isn't helping cooperation in the Gulf but the u.s. is trying to encourage discussion of Iran's influence in the Arab world the White House support 'day high-level meeting of military officers from the Gulf Cooperation Council in Kuwait this month but Qatar has been under saudi-led blockade since June 2017 Qatari leaders denied accusations of funding terrorism and to close a relationship with Iran Atta is the only GCC member to have signed a bilateral agreement with the United States to combat terrorist financing let's bring in our panelists joining us from Doha Abraham fry had associate professor of conflict resolution Doha Institute for graduate studies in Tehran Hamid Moussaoui professor of political science at the University of Tehran and from Washington DC Hillary man Leverett former US State Department official and CEO of the political risk consultancy strata welcome to the program brahim when the report talks about the decline in attacks and casualties from terrorist groups is that an indication that groups for example like ISIL and al-qaida have lost the fight well first of all the report talks about a reduction in number of attacks by by Isis by about 23 percent compared to last year so it's very obvious that the removal of Isis from mosul and raqqa has impacted the numbers of attacks that launched by these by Isis this year however this leaves us with two major questions one is that whether these numbers are sustainable whether there are continuing they're going to continue because what could happen is that that Isis is after the removal from from Mosul and Raqqa they're probably you know repositioning themselves like what happened in al-qaeda with al-qaida back in 2000 2003 that the removal of al-qaeda and Taliban in Afghanistan was followed by some sort of quietness in terms of activities but later actually we see we saw that more of al-qaeda repositioning itself and resuming its actors and other important who major think that we have to keep in mind is that removing an organization the governance structure of an organization from two cities mosul and raqqa does not in any way me and that the end of the phenomenon and here I'm talking about terrorism as a phenomenon that has been actually in the region for a long time mhm so if I think Isis is something and violent extremism is totally separate thing okay so in my view I don't think this suggests any major conclusions for the phenomenon itself and it doesn't mean that while Isis could probably lost the battle but violent extremism will continue I mean the Iranian mission of the United Nations said that basically the the the the the statement of the survey the the annual report by the State Department ignores the fact that Iran has played a crucial role in the fight against ISIL particularly in places like Iraq and and and Syria do the Iranians feel somehow that they are being singled out for a political reason yes I mean this is a contradiction in the report on the one hand the report says that the number of attacks have decreased by twenty three percent compared to last year because of isil's defeat yet we have to ask who has been the primary player in defeating ISIL Iran has played a major role in helping the Iraqi and Syrian government's in defeating ISIL and actually Iran has lost several thousand soldiers in this regard in comparison the United States that was not willing to put boots on the ground they only conducted air campaigns and we have to remember that the air campaigns actually came very late in the game actually a 2016 audio leaked by John Kerry who was then the Secretary of State revealed that the US had actually allowed ISIL to grow in order to put pressure on Assad so I think the United States is actually in no position to accuse Iran of terrorism and region Hillary this is a complex landscape I mean I still could have been widely defeated in places like Syria and Iraq but they remain pretty much active in places like the Yemen or also North Africa and sub-saharan Africa so the findings of the report itself could be misleading to the international audience in a way or another yes and I mean the the entire reason the United States has these terrorism reports is is a political one these reports started in 1979 with Iran as a charter member of this of what we call these state sponsors of terrorism and the reason was was that President Carter back in the in the 1970s started to focus more on human rights in countries and had mandated the State Department to produce reports on human rights in countries those focused uncomfortably on American allies particularly on Israel and Saudi Arabia there are their friends their lobbyists here in Washington needed to have an answer to that and that they pushed for these terrorism reports and since 1979 these terrorism reports have focused yes on some incidents of terrorism around the world what I think most analysts objectively would refer to terrorism but they have also focused very much in a political way on those groups and countries the United States doesn't like and that range is not just from a country like Iran but also to the Nelson Mandela's ANC in South Africa for example they were blasted in these terrorism reports early on and some of the political parties in Iraq that the United States works with today like the Dawa party was a was a was a listed organization of for terrorism so there is very much a political motivation which muddies the word waters in terms of what's actually happening in terms of incidents and and and and steps to prevent prevent terrorism terrorism smiths Ibrahim Hillary was talking about the political reasons behind the annual report did it come to you as a surprise when Iran was singled out in the report as Sorrell somehow the state leading sponsor of terrorism in the in the world well as regional analyst in politics of the region here it has it was not in any way surprising to me because I totally agree with my colleague from Washington that the entire philosophy and purpose of this report is highly highly politicized and it's used in an extremely selective way and in particular never mentions Israel as my colleague also said so Iran in terms of my understanding of the u.s. foreign policy since that Iran's since the Riyadh summit back in May 2017 where the whole alliance you know was forged between the Trump administration Saudi Arabia UAE and to a large extent the Israel the center of this alliance was Iran and how to counter Iran and how to put an end to the Iranians influence and expansion of what they say in the region so if you followed the u.s. policy from that moment until now whether it's the cancellation of the nuclear deal whether it is the harsh sanctions that were imposed recently on Iran so this one just one additional step in in that overall policy in order to increase the pressure on Iran and to single out Iran that because it's keep in mind on the issue and Iran here because here we're talking about two different definitions whether it's terrorism as ISIL or Al Qaeda or something else by but the United States what it's referring to here is in terms of Iran's relationship and support to the Houthis and Saleh and Iraq okay Hamid I mean to sum up the report particular when it comes to Iran it talks about two things about the new global reach of Iran basically Iran is destabilizing force in places like Yemen the Afghanistan Bahrain and also bring in to its terrorist activities the resources of a state this is exactly the wording in the report is this an indication that we might see more confrontation between the Americans and the Iranians in the short term when we talk about destabilizing the region we have to remember that this whole mess was created after the United States illegally invaded Iraq in 2003 and the instability actually spread in the region and wherever the Americans have gone to in the past two decades have turned into disasters Afghanistan Libya Iraq etc now with regards to Iran Iran actually publicly declares that it does support Hezbollah however Iran does not see Hezbollah as a terrorist organization Hezbollah does not carry terrorist attacks in European capitals or in the United States it's a local resistance group fighting against Israel and if we declare every force that is fighting Israel as terrorists then yes it will be but that's not how Iran sees it a regarding confrontation between Iran and the United States unfortunately we are going down that path because every few days the Trump administration is accusing Iran of something new and I think this is part of a much larger campaign okay trying to dehumanize the Iranian people as well as imposing sanctions on them mm-hmm Hillary the Americans made it quite clear that they would like to ramp up sanctions against Iran and they're trying to convince a major allies to follow suit I mean this report do you find it as an element that could further put more pressure on Western allies particularly to say you know what it's about time we follow the Americans in this particular path yes absolutely though there is an important debate or perhaps even war going on within the Trump administration between those that want to I mean I would say the key decision-makers in the Trump administration are all very much either anti Iran or Iran Hawks but in different and important ways someone for example like the National Security Advisor John Bolton is looking to build a case with terrorism data like in this report to build a case for regime-change to overthrow the government in Iran that's what someone like National Security Advisor John Bolton is looking at someone like Secretary of State Pompeo though and perhaps even president Trump himself is looking to build a case against Iran including with terrorism data like in this report in order to put maximum pressure on Iran to force Iran to sign a wide-ranging broad treaty with the United States as is their approach with North Korea because President Trump and secretary Pompeo don't really care that much about the the subtleties or the data involving terrorism or nuclear weapons or any of the other lists of concerns United States puts out there so you have someone like secretary Pompeo maybe even defense secretary mattis and maybe even president Trump himself against these these other players like secre and security advisor john bolton who want to overthrow the iranian government they are both using this data for their own for their own strategies and the there is not one settled strategy yet within the US government it's very much a battle within the government whether to use this data to force Iran into a negotiation for a deal with the United States like it's doing with North Korea or to use this data to build a case - literally overthrow the Iranian government Ibrahim the key regional players in the region some of them made it quite clear that they would like to they support the Americans in the push to counter what is described to be an Iranian growing influence in the region is this a similar feeling among the key international players particularly the EU no of course not because we have seen the divergence and positions of the international community between the u.s. between the Trump administration and bit and the Europeans though at the same time we have to keep in mind that actually Europe and you know some other countries have failed to come up with a strategy to counter the American strategy in dealing with Iran and all the attempts that were made we haven't seen many of that so I think this does not know that the rest of the world you know is taking a different position on this issue I that does not or is not minimizing the pressure coming from the United States and the escalation in the crisis that again the the alliance that was forged after the Riyadh summit in May 2017 that is leading in this and continues to shape the politics of the region at this level I mean some of the accusations leveled against Iran in the report are similar to what we hear in the region particularly about Iran people say many countries you know them they say basically Iran is spreading radical ideology in the region Iran is providing significant helps of the Houthis to undermine a legitimate government Iran is trying to counter the Sunni presence in the Arab world with a new radical narrative isn't this an important moment for the Iranians to say wait a second isn't this the right time to start reaching out to our arch rivals in the region particularly countries like Saudi Arabia Iran has actually indicated that it does want to improve relations with Saudi Arabia however in recent months it has become very difficult because the Saudis have actually become very close to the Israelis and they have actually become part of the Saudi Emirati Israeli effort to sanction Iran in the region we have to remember that the sanctions on Iran are having a very important impact I mean right now it is even crucial drugs are hard to find within Iran so so when when you see these hostile actions by the other side you have to expect Iran to also get defensive and I think Iran we have to remember that it is responding to a very destabilizing and threatening regional environment on when the Trump administration decided to leave the nuclear a grou accord four months ago and by the way the IAEA since then has confirmed that Iran is actually abiding by its side of the deal even though the United States has left so on the one hand you seen all of these pressures building up on Iran and I think it would be inappropriate for Iran to not respond in its own kind hillarie the the the report expresses concerns about the ongoing crisis in the Gulf region saying that this erodes all attempts to try to tackles regional security issues you know the situation right now there's absolutely no indication that we're going to see any political settlement what's next for the Americans well that's one of the most fascinating important parts of this report I have almost never seen such a documented case in one of these u.s. terrorism reports giving credit to praising another country as it has done in this in this report with with Qatar it has documented very seriously very substantively all the steps that cutter has done working with Washington that Doha has done working with Washington to address almost every single one of Washington's concerns in the in the realm of terrorism in the realm of security of a range of issues in the Gulf so I think it shows what a dramatic change what a dramatic impact card is foreign minister and defense minister had here in Washington after the may Riyadh summit when things went so terribly terribly wrong given that basis it's still very much a political decision how Washington addresses the ongoing saudi-led blockade of Qatar but I think this report gives at least a substantive basis for those in Washington to try to continue efforts to bring to bring this more to a peace clothes rather than just to take the side of the salaries of their Emiratis as was the initial inclination Ibrahim ultimately do you think that this is going to be the Americans step in putting all that political leverage in the region I'm telling all the parties you know what you need to set aside your differences come onboard because your help is crucial at this particular moment oh do you think it's too late at this at this particular moment well first let me agree again with my colleague from Washington and I think from what we've seen in this report I mean this is considered in my view a breakthrough that the United States is taking such a firm position a very clear very clearly stated that Qatar has done such and such and such and such all documented in a formal document in collaboration and fighting and countering terrorism this is unprecedented because from also our understanding of how the United States manages its relations with its allies is always trying to keep in the middle and try to keep good relations with both sides without really given you know one party set in possesses a clear position supporting one kata as they did their support however with all the killing that is given to Qatar now I don't think we should overestimate and overly like what is what is the United States is going to do as a result with that it's going to you know intervene and put an end to the Gulf crisis I don't think so however what I think the Wright State is likely to do is that to bring the parties together on certain segments of its foreign policy and that segment with that serving its interests and its foreign policy but keeping the crisis and me and this is why I'm saying this is also because just a week ago the United States was able to bring the army chiefs of the GCC countries to a meeting in Kuwait in order to coordinate some effort so that was that was the first time we saw these examity together to serve again a segment on the a segment of the u.s. foreign policy but I don't think that or it's too still too too early to see or to expect that the United States going to intervene and put an end to the car to the Gulf crisis Hamid you can defeat terrorism militarily I mean but the problem is that the idea continues and one-one I'm not an historian but many will tell you that terrorism thrives in areas that stifle discontent where you don't have vibrant democracies places like the Yemen Syria Iraq and many places around the world do you think that this could further push many countries including Iran to start reaching out to key regional players to agree about political settlements that can endure and where democracy can thrive yes I mean it's true that a political instability leads to the rise of terrorism but also when there is a power vacuum for example like what happened in Iraq after the 2003 invasion leads to the thriving of terrorism now right now the situation has somewhat stabilized in countries such as Iraq and Syria nevertheless when this content is still there and when there is still a power vacuum there is always the real possibility that terrorism might rise again now in regards to Iraq Iran has actually tried to cooperate with the Iraqi government on this regard on the issue of Syria there has been several rounds of talks between Iran Turkey and Russia however we still have to wait and see whether whether that will actually result in an actual political settlement what we need in these kinds of regions are political settlements of course hamid Moussa Ibrahim
