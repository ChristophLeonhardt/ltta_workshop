hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report only one day to go before the ninth birthday of Bitcoin just think about that in nine years it went from absolutely unknown piece of software to world-shaking Wall Street transforming society busting megohm important thing hello yes max it was January 3rd 2009 where Bitcoin was first mined Genesis block happened January 3rd 2009 so it's this ninth birthday tomorrow and we will be celebrating with Jameson laughs and a whole bunch of people out in Durham North Carolina big party in Durham on bitcoins ninth birthday sent to Genesis block and it's gone through a lot of biblical drama you think about it the Bitcoin Jesus became Bitcoin Judas he had the old testament of the original gangsters really gave way to the new testament of the flash of the pan CNBC CNBC fast money types and it's been attempted to be crucified several times as well and it's been reborn several times so it's kind of like the Bible on steroids well the money changers didn't they get kicked out of the temple or something like that and all their money and coins uh splattered all over the place that has happened on many of the exchanges the Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and all sorts of crazy stuff and of course many people have been piling in to Bitcoin in the past year especially 2017 is probably when most people heard about Bitcoin and got involved a bought the first Bitcoin certainly even people involved in our show and we've been talking about Bitcoin since 2011 two years after its birth it was two three dollars back then and we talked about it many many times we've we've interviewed all the top players in the Bitcoin space the top guys and you know cameraman and editors and executives of our show have been watching these episodes for years and it wasn't until September October that they finally started saying how do I get one of these where I want to buy it and you're like wait you waited until it was like $20,000 to even think about buying we told you to buy it two or three that's the amazing thing isn't it people that we've been talking about it for years finally what is he what 18 19 20 thousands were suddenly curious about and started buying it but that's the way it always is with these types of ideas they're completely dismissed at first and then when they end up changing every the game people suddenly get interested so that's that's not unusual I also want to say you know because a lot of people will only be new to this and they have endured the drama of who what's been happening with Bitcoin since the futures were introduced and since the huge drops and very huge volatility be cash or Bitcoin cash and all this sort of drama over the Christmas period on these exchanges they might be alarmed so what I would say is that you should go to YouTube enter Kai's report Bitcoin and look back through the years that this is kind of normal for this whole area it's you know you have to think of it like that sort of that Cambrian explosion the pre Cambrian explosion of evolution these are ideas being explored and a lot of failures and some great successes in fact what humans come out of things the successes that happened in a pre can be an explosion well remember the dot-com crash the whole the whole Nasdaq blew up drop 70 80 % trillions of dollars disappeared all kinds of companies went vaporized but from the mess came we Google you know Apple was reborn Amazon so these are the winners and now they dominate global trade and global market action so the same thing with Bitcoin they're probably you know in another huge drop as we will probably see the survivors will come up and be world beating companies and world beating applications and coins I don't know if we've had any more gifts this year but I'm sure there will be many more Forks in 2018 so it might be good to hold your Bitcoin and hopefully there will also be clarity because you know I think a lot of people were holding through 2017 any Americans in the Bitcoin space because of the lack of clarity from the IRS is it an out is it a commodity is it property is it you know is income do you pay capital gains what is it so I know that's why I haven't like really sold any because I don't know what what I would what the tax implications are but I want to you know talk you Jamis lop we will be with him on the birthday of Bitcoin on the ninth birthday and first I want to say because of course we've had a volatile Christmas the past few weeks that has been very volatile over a Bitcoin it just kept on going up it was parabolic up and you know you would see down days of 10-15 percent and people like flipped out they were scared panicked this of course is normal for our experience that we've witnessed through Bitcoin through the past nine years but here's Jameson lop with Bitcoin obituaries proclaimed per year and 2010 there was one death of Bitcoin proclaimed in 2011 there were six I remember that year in 2012 there was only one in 2013 there were 15 in 2014 there were 29 and 2015 there were 39 in 2016 there were 28 and in 2017 93 deaths Bitcoin pronounced so how many do you think there will be in 2018 oh well about using that chart as a guy there'll be you know two or three hundred I suppose but Cohen is unique it's an it's the fifth element it's completely unique in that it's a non reproducible non counterfeit of all digital object that can be used back and forth electronically as a store of value and that had never occurred before this brilliant Genesis block was mine based on the 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto white paper and it means that all banks all central banks are disintermediated they are no longer needed this is they're going to go the way of the music industry when Napster was introduced you know it's just not going to survive in the same way that it did and we often said that the biggest terrorists in the world are bankers like Jamie Dimon this is the terrorist killer this is going to put more terrorists out of business on Wall Street City of London than anything else and I think it was divinely inspired well certainly it has generated a lot of cult sort of following the you know disciples and apostles and this is a direct pipeline to God okay is that too much of a cult-like statement yes yes and I wanted to say you mentioned the dot-com bubble you were around for that and survived that rise and fall and you were right to point out that there were a lot of people always say oh bitcoin is like pets calm but what people are saying in response is like no this is the internet and pets calm failed but just like some of the altcoins might fail but you know the things like Amazon Google survived and then new companies like Facebook and Twitter that weren't around during the first calm crash so you know things can happen but there is a bit of sort of bubble hysteria going on that you see in this next headline a small fin tech stock surged 2600 percent in a week after announcing it's a crypto company fin tech plus cryptocurrency equals about 7 billion dollars that's how much the value of longfin corporation surged to after the micro-cap stock rocketed by as much as two thousand six hundred percent since debuting right before Christmas most of the gains came when the company issued a press release saying at Bazzi do.com a blockchain empowered global micro lending solutions provider that transact only in crypto currencies so if the CEO of this company even went on CNBC or when in Bloomberg one of the financial news outlets and he was like this is too much why are you doing this this is overvalued but people it was a penny stock and it acted like an altcoin not even any altcoin I don't think has ever risen by two thousand six hundred percent in a week well why is this happening it's because the reason why Bitcoin was created as we celebrate the birthday of the Genesis block it was created to do battle with central banks and banks around the world who are irresponsibly printing money without lending it out simply to bail out bankrupt institutions around the world and this has led to ask the price explosion and the upward march of wealth to the top one-tenth of 1% the global economy is incredibly distorted unlike in any time in history what billionaires are being created faster than one can possibly legitimize given the underlying economy is growing quite tepidly you know Warren Buffett himself said that a company that's growing at a multiple of inflation is probably doing it in a crooked way because there's no way you can outstrip to its degree something that you're bound by laws of physics and laws of business to some degree and here you have this company skyrocketing a value because there are literally hundreds of trillions of dollars of ill-gotten gains sitting in offshore accounts and sitting in hedge funds and sitting on Wall Street who are bored they're looking for something to do they see Jim Cramer on CNBC screaming about something or they hear about this and they just put the money available for this as instantaneous is there money to fight climate change no is there money to increase labor wages to restore dignity to society through jobs no no no not at all it's only money available to the kleptocracy in the oligarchs well I also think you know rapping heading into the last minute or two here I want to say that you know Janet Yellen they're starting to pull away the punch bowl and I think this could be also part of all of that cash trillions and trillions and trillions have been created in the last few years and everybody's been waiting for something to happen remember in 2008 2009 the likes of Peter Schiff are saying hyperinflation is coming his call may have been too early but you know that this could be some sort of hyper inflationary mindset that is out there it's happening in crypto currencies is happening in the equity markets this happening bonds is happening in everything so if this could be a last hurrah like people like downing the drinks before the you know the the bar closes well it's a Peter shifts point you know it's all hinged on the US dollar the world reserve currency which is being held up through to the of coordinated central bank fraud when somebody breaks rank this is going to happen in 2018 one of the major central banks in the world will start buying Bitcoin they'll break ranks from the other central banks that are colluding to aggressively expand money supply to bail out corrupt banks but when one of these banks breaks off and says you know what we can triple quadruple quintuple our money by going into crypto and you guys can go and fend for yourself then the torrent of those trillions of dollars worth of cash that have been kept out of the economy due to illegal mass donations by the central banks comes flooding in and the real hyperinflation kicks in the dollar crash is spectacularly that's happening in 2018 by the way the Kaiser report was also born in 2009 just to not that we're all the same but we were born the same year Bitcoin was I'm not Satoshi anybody we're in a new studio here and I want to say we will be getting some sort of like graphics and stuff like that behind us but I just want to introduce you to our new studio here in Raleigh so happy birthday to us happy birthday to Satoshi nakamoto's Bitcoin here Satoshi I knew it alright well stay tuned for the second half a lot coming your way welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time down a return to our conversation Michael Pento Pento port dot-com money manager extraordinaire out there in New Jersey the Bayonne bleeder they call you you know yeah remember uh Chuck Wepner is that boxer yeah that was you tell you yeah you almost beat Muhammad Ali really yeah did they bottled the Rocky character after Chuck Wepner Bayonne bleeder all right geez I know more about that Jersey than you yeah the most people living in New Jersey okay so Michael Pento let's get back to this you know Bitcoin and you know you're got a negative view on it and the points you make just to recap here that there's a vulnerability at the exchanges and the on ramp off ramp the where government could go in there and cause havoc I mentioned there's an intellectual property challenge that could be made of people banks gonna say we own the IP for this type of technology similar to the way Microsoft attacked open source software like Linux by saying we've got certain intellectual property they're they trying to invalidate this competitor you also mention the possibility of a Fed coin fed coin comes around it's a crypto coin it's a digital coin and your idea is that they want to wean folks off cash yes they want to get people into a permanent negative interest rate scenario which they will need to do to extricate the economy out of the next great depression which is coming unfortunately in my opinion right so the depression comes when market collapses market collapses because nothing was done to stop it from the last collapse except give the worst actors in the economy more money to go create more problems Lobley so 70 trillion an increase in debt since 2008 globally so they're going to have to do something they only have about a hundred and twenty five basis points of bullets in the in the in the can there buy it to fire the I say I mean what is what does Japan have to get themselves that they've got zero what does Germany have they have nothing so there's nothing really to reduce the overnight negative bank so they have to go to negative they can't do negative interest rates if they have physical cash I'll just go I take all my hundreds out put them under my mattress and you can say I get negative ten percent but I don't have negative ten percent because I have you know right whatever X number of dollars stuff is stuffed in my house so they have to get the world used to living off of a digital currency and by the way there was a person nominated to the Fed by mr. Trump called Marvin good friend and what does Marvin good friend love more than anything in the whole world Bitcoin besides Bitcoin negative nominal interest really look it up okay all right so there there's the you know you're building a strong case here so so bitcoin is just like the the gateway drug it's just opening up to this Fed coin okay now here's my Mike Mike some of my you know repost some of this thought is that the I think that the creation of Bitcoin going all the way back to the 2008 white paper which describes the introduction to it which mentions Bank bank fraud problems in the banking system and problems in the central bank system it's always been a race against the failure of the current system the failure of the banking system and the failure of the fiat money system the fractional reserve system the what you're talking about would require more organization that's possible in an environment of more failing banks in 2018 I think we're gonna see a big bank like deutsche bank collapse or some big Bank on the UK collapse because as you know and as I know you're they are technically insolvent Italy Italy will collapse I mean Italy is on the verge of collapse that'll change that chain reaction that sets off and the chaos that ensues it will it's not going to be ability to manage that any reasonable way and that's why this push to Bitcoin and I think Bitcoin price the reason is so high is that it's discounting of banking Armageddon its telegraphing as markets are discounting mechanism they're telling us that in very near future you're gonna have another 2008 banking catastrophe my Greenwald I agree with everything you just said here's my issue I'm sure you have thoughts on this the government really doesn't suffer anti-money laundering flouting very readily and they know your customer rules they don't like people flouting those either and they really don't want to with alacrity give up control over the entire fiat currency regime so why are they giving all this rope to cryptocurrencies because is the reason is maxwell's because they want to get the the citizenry used to using a digital currency and they want to completely get rid of all of paper currencies and like I said this is gonna this is coming I don't know I think it is coming in 2018 and then they been all privates yeah cryptocurrencies for one public blockchain that they completely control by the way when they do that they can track every single transaction so the underground economy goes away tax evaders go away and they'll do it under the guise of worrying about you know AML and kyc and terrorists funding and they have all the the subliminal reasons why this is gonna be six okay and while the well the public is worrying about what the bra size of kim kardashian they're gonna be happy i'll have no control left over their money there'll be no protection from inflation the purchasing power of their money can be destroyed at the will of the government i think you're giving too much credit to governments and if they wanted to co-op it coin they could have during the early years using what's called a 51% attack they could have been op alized mining with the resources of one or two governments combined they didn't because they was not on their radar they have no idea what this is and it's completely outside of it they do now though don't think but now it's beyond their reach the computational robustness of the protocol is such that no country or group of countries or even a global effort could could co-opt or usurp the Bitcoin protocol at this point is beyond them which is one of another reason why it keeps going higher in prices because it can't be attacked in that way second reason is that we have an example here you know of game theory game theory I don't know if you follow game theory in the Nash equilibrium and this idea where all of the interests of a given scenario are equally balanced to the point where participants are motivated not to snitch on each other there's this it's in won a Nobel Prize I believe for just a movie okay so we've already seen that play out in Bitcoin with the mining and you know their Chinese are very dominant mining now that Japanese are in mining was in Eastern Europe or and mining because there's a huge game theory experiment going on where no one ends up with having too much control because it gets distributed and the the powers is distributed this game theory is going to jump to the nation-state so in other words McCoy will become a strategic reserve for central banks and Russia or China could be getting or Japan mining Bitcoin as a strategic reserve as they would buy gold in the face of a collapsing fiat currency that we're seeing all over the world we both agree that fiat is vulnerable we both know that central banks are buying gold we both know that bitcoin is incredibly robust and becoming a multi trillion dollar asset once Central Bank's start to play the game theory with each other in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining then that's another reason why you're not going to have any one state come in and decide to outlaw it and do this and do that because all the entire business which is going to flow to the territory that welcomes this new business so it's it's it's competition of the fittest is survival the fittest and no one country has a monopoly on this thing its global and it's playing out globally well you might be right but I think the IMF together with the global central banks will shut it down the IMF is bankrupt we know that they were completely bankrupt before that tried to before the interfere with the Greece with the troika the ECB and and then the EU and the EC and before then they were about to close up shop and go away because they were but they're bankrupt they then got a bunch of banks to regard them Christine Lagarde can issue her own currency the SDR yeah especially because I've seen the feds bankrupt or insolvent another most leveraged bank in the history of banks backed by nothing but who understand that that's the roll-up all the global debt into a global Special Drawing right to bail out all the banks again yes but it's another fiat currency that's going to drive more capital into gold and more capital into Bitcoin I mean that there's Bitcoin is a response to the SDR the SDR is just another fiat currency this can't bail out of fiat currency with another fiat currency and you know what you know what max you know who really gets hurt is the middle class walk is flush down why there's millions and millions of millionaires right now because a Bitcoin but because of the inflationary policies that going to be in inflicted on the American public and the European public and in Japan Japanese public and and the you know the PBOC is out there right now trying to keep the Ponzi scheme as David Stockman calls it the read Ponzi scheme afloat I tell you something all these things are going to collapse probably in 2018 because we have an inverted yield curve probably by October of 2018 okay so in the short end of the yield curve interest rates are higher than the long end of yield curve right now we have 53 basis points between the two year in the 10-year note that's going to invert now if we have that cause credit to season well if I'm a bank and I have to pay a deposit or more than a loan why am I gonna make any more loans I don't want any more deposit LIBOR went up so we're adding to a credit crisis how are they good absolutely with no idea you know it with no mo other than the things I mentioned before helicopter money a universal basic income and negative interest rate policies made possible by this Universal because a Fed coin or an IMF coin okay now there's three billion people on earth with an internet connection and now it's easy it is easy to go to an app on your smartphone and you've got whatever of the 150 currencies that are out there in the world actively traded and you can put five bucks into a crypto coin that's going up in value and that your buying power just went up in a world where they're printing to hundreds of trillions of dollars to bail out the worst financial scum and terrorists that have ever walked the face of the earth the Bernanke is that Janet Yellen is the Lloyd Blankfein's at Jamie diamonds the guys who make a sama bin Laden look like Mother Teresa people react to that and they react physically and this civilly and they want to escape the matrix of the fiat world I implore you how much crypto do you own well how many you want to give me for Christmas is how much have a good own how do you allow yourself to be exposed to the ravages of Fiat in this matter I still believe say one of the best things about what cryptocurrencies offer is the ability to move money around the world digitally yeah well guess what there are companies like gold money which I own that it has a private blockchain that allows me to own gold and monetize it instantly and that's where I'm putting my hope in maybe they also now offer Bitcoin they offered net what they offer now you kill cold store it though that's right they'll engrave your and why are they doing that silly because because the market for gold is dead nobody's buying gold anymore you can't give it away except for sheiks you want 24 karat gold toilet bowl nobody wants a freakin gold bar and that's it is it it's very sad what about this Michael Pento yes sir do you ascribe to the theory that the features gold price is in part responsible for the difficulty Gold is having in the physical market to achieve paper gold prices paper gold artificial paper gold yeah do you believe those yes I do people people getting rid of you know millions and millions of dollars of gold within five seconds putting in a market order right you know when there's no when there's no market around okay you know that does a coordinated basis did they do that to hit the price of gold yeah of course they do sell a large chunk of gold yeah millions of ounces would you sell it when there was no liquidity in the middle of the night all at once with the market order clear indication of manipulation yes but but but manipulation goes both ways yeah but but but we haven't seen engulfing so let me ask you this if Bitcoin in disintermediate all the banks and all the Wall Street machinery isn't then clearing a path the price of gold to go higher I'm saying okay I finally agree with him alone yes absolutely Michael Pento blows Bitcoin take the words out of my well we gotta go sadly Justin things are heating up don't come to New Jersey next time other guys a report with me Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert like to thank our guest Michael Pento Pento port actually you should go there and look at his work he puts out a research that's extremely interesting even though it doesn't cover Bitcoin it does it does it does Wolvie I'm not favorably know Twitter yeah we're on Twitter Keiser Report you can follow us there until next time
