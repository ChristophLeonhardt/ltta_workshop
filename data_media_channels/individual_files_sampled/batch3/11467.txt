hi there this is Max Keiser this is the Kaiser 'part ICU you know America's being disenfranchised by the core policy they don't tell you about it on your local news station because they're part of the conspiracy am I crazy no is it real yes here to tell us more is the wonderful and gorgeous stacy herbert max we're still in Durham North Carolina where it's nice and sunny and warm and we're gonna be heading to New York City for the next few episodes and that's gonna be kind of cold but you know over the past few episodes we've been talking about the American oligarchs we've been talking about the new robber barons Jeff Bezos now worth over a hundred billion dollars cities are handing over the keys to democracy for him to come bring Amazon second headquarters there we talked about Bill Gates not quite worth a hundred billion dollars but he is a philanthropist giving a lot of money to help create clean water over in Africa and we found that the people of Alabama and the his own home country which has made him so wealthy well he's not helping out down there so much and now we turn to Warren Buffett yet another one of our favorite cuddly billionaires she's the most cuddly of all actually and he's in the news because you know we've had a hurricane after hurricane many natural disasters but we also have the baby boomers retire and this has created basically a backlog of people wanting mobile homes mobile homes are so expensive now hurricane victims can't afford them the industry led by Warren Buffett Clayton Homes is peddling such pricey interior designer touches as breakfast bars and his and her bathroom sings these extras plus manufacturers increased cost for labor and materials have pushed average prices for new double wides up more than 20% in five years putting them out of reach from many of the newly homeless so about 22 million Americans live in what are called manufacturer homes that no longer really called mobile homes are called manufactured homes and now we have thousands and thousands of people in huge sways the Florida down to Naples Florida Key West and Houston where we've had the two hurricanes Harvey and Irma make many people lose their homes and they have to replace them and there they can't find well you know the financial crisis of 2008 remember the bank's over-leveraged they crashed and the government along with warren buffett the government and warren buffett decided to bail out not only the banks but themselves by getting the banks to bail himself out and to use the money from taxpayers to buy old cop allistic positions and monopoly positions in housing and mobile homes so these guys are not wealthy because they are smart or because they work hard because they gain the system and they rob us blind and now he's America's biggest slumlord congratulations Warren you can play your little ukulele song Warren Buffet and I'm a slumlord I'm an Okie from down Nowheresville that gets billions of subsidies from the government and you pay for it you stupid Americans here's Charlie Munger he's practically dead I mean a billionaire even though he's brain-dead so unfortunately there's no stopping oligarchy in America there's no government anymore there's no market forces anymore there's no price discovery anymore there's only free money give it away through the interest rate apartheid state to the guys living on the right side of the apartheid interest rate wall everyone else is in the freakin ghetto yeah more and more Americans are having to move into these manufactured homes the interest rates on loans if you can even get a loan by the way Oh far more expensive for mobile homes obviously because they're not built into a foundation they're not as long lasting as a home dirty hippy insurance I'll show you the insurance to my old Geico and a lot of other insurance companies it's a subsidy okay okay people had enough of your singing but let's move on to the fact that you mentioned the 2008 financial crisis a lot of the builders and other manufacturers of mobile homes manufactured homes sorry they went out of business or they stopped they laid off a lot of workers and now this is part of the problem of why there's such a shortage of these homes by this is something like a six-month backlog a lot of these places to even get a home because they don't have that enough workers who know how to make these homes anymore but they say about 22 million Americans live in manufactured homes a classification that dates back to 1976 when federal law set standards for what used to be called mobile homes sales of new units are growing 15% annually as the base of buyers expands from rural areas to suburbs and retirement enclaves tile backsplashes and kitchen pantries fad and profits and attract buyers who couldn't afford similar extravagances and conventional houses the industry which makes up 80% of new homes that sell for less than 150,000 was struggling to keep up with demand even before the Hurricanes manufacturers that closed plants after the housing crash say they're having difficulty adding capacity because of shortage of labour skills so you know here you have a situation where we've talked about the wealth and income gap that you know more and more is going to the top 1% to the Jeff besos or the Warren Buffett's to the Bill Gates of the world and you have doctors lawyers all these other people being squashed down that they can't afford the homes and the cities you hear a lot of construction going on here in Durham which is a boom City by the way there they're being forced into mobile homes just forcing out the population I mean as they say mobile home a hundred and fifty thousand dollars if you're doing three times your income for the mortgage you have to be earning at least 50,000 that's way below with a the household income at the bottom is yeah of course a lot of people will mistakenly blame capitalism for this when this is just socialism Buffett is a socialist and so is Jeff Bezos they believe in being given unlimited amounts of free money from a corrupt government central government that they control if there was capitalism in America these guys would have paid the price for being propagate horrible business people of 2008 by getting themselves in over the head too much risk too much debt they would have gone out of business there would have been a market sell-off we would have had a new generation of entrepreneurs and we would have had capitalism as that concept was understood in America it's tied to the idea of free market economics is tied to the enlightenment is tied to the thinking that went behind the intellectual bedrock of America based on the rights of man you go back to the French enlightenment the French thinkers James Locke these types of people who gave us the idea of government buying for the people now you've got government buying for Oleg arcs and kleptocrats it's not capitalism it's kind of like socialism but it's more like monarchy a kleptocracy kakastico see ruled by the stupidest and worst amongst us and the end result is either a we submit to this tyranny and live on our knees begging for scraps from these gosh darn ugly putrid plutocratic crack like warren or we interact those are the two choices y'all you got two choices bank or insect that's it well of course one of the ways that you're supposed to rise up not in the way that max is referring to there but rise up through your own meritocracy you know go to university get an education compete in the marketplace get a job be able to afford one of these apartments or condos going up behind us in you know durham right behind us of course here in in Durham and Raleigh the Research Triangle you have UNC you have Duke two great universities but paying for your college thirty years ago versus today taking into account tuition room board and fees across two thousand three hundred and twelve public and private colleges and universities in the u.s. the average price of an undergraduate degree increased sixty three thousand nine hundred and seventy three dollars or roughly two hundred and sixty one percent since nineteen eighty seven that's what I entered University in 1987 prices are now up two hundred and sixty one percent since them inflation adjusted so inflation the tuition has gone up but the job that tuition that the income that you can earn when you graduate has gone up like this much let me explain something to everybody out there is wants to be a success in life there's two ways to go you can either become educated you can do that by herself go to the New York University website to the Gallatin Division and get the syllabus on the book list that all Gallatin Division students have to know I was in the Gallatin division at New York University it's approximately 250 books starting with Aristotle read those books now you're educated the second way you could be a success in life is you got to know three things bridge golf tennis okay for things and skiing if you know any of these four preferably all four like bridge you get to play bridge Warren Buffett he's a big bridge player if you play golf you hang out to country club you know what the insider trading tips are tennis you know same thing tennis clubs you know that and skiing you go to staad you go to Sugar Hill you go to all these expensive you meet the right people only make the right contacts and you make it the right deals and the right information so those are your two paths either go know those four skills bridge tennis golf and skiing or read the galton division of NYU's syllabus for every graduate in that program and get educated those are your two paths in life everything else is noise by the way I've been - Todd if you want to look like a buffoon go down the French side the French people the french-speaking side those are the best looking skiers in the world I have to say the other side the german-speaking side they're all wear lederhosen and they ski even worse than Americans so that's my tip over there but again so prices for university education has gone up two hundred and sixty 1% the average income for an employee a graduate degree a person graduating with a degree a bachelor's degree has gone up 2.3 percent in that time so that is gone from an average income in 1987 again an inflation adjusted is 49,000 406 in in 1987 2016 is fifty thousand five hundred and fifty six so that's with a college degree the average income is fifty thousand five hundred and fifty six remember I just said the mobile homes are hundred and fifty thousand to three times the income so that's what you can aspire to going into huge amount of debt getting this degree and then having to go into a mobile home or sorry manufactured home to make you feel a little bit better but that's all you have in this rig so let me give you a tip anybody out there he wants become a millionaire multi millionaire a billionaire pancakes the world has an insatiable demand for pancakes and waffles no matter where you are China Vietnam Oklahoma Florida Antarctica there's an insatiable demand for pancakes they're cheap you know you pump them out I'm telling you pancakes is the road to riches well I think it's time to go to the second half because I'm gonna go make some pancakes oh that's fantastic stay tuned for the second half a lot more don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to distinguish the local politician four-time mayor of Pittsboro North Carolina former chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party Randy bowler it's good to be back max so you got a gift for me I do we're here in Durham on the top of the hotel my grandfather used to play ball over here it matches your Bitcoin I mean this is my bit of the colors all right so what is celebrating this something my grandfather used to catch for the old New York Giants and he played minor league ball right out here in Durham in 1930 yes Bull Durham that's about the what the minor league team right in Durham it is Susan Sarandon I don't think there were women that beautiful when he played that we're luring him into situations now he didn't share them with you no he didn't tell you about it no they didn't even have I'll call back then they had to go over here and dig it up on the old farm it was the Prohibition days pan players didn't get paid max different time oh my god all right well let's get into some hot political issues let's talk about net neutrality it's suddenly a hot issue that at least online the Democratic Party itself is still focused on the fake Russia story fake Russia gate story but what's the u.s. look like without net neutrality have you looked at this Randy what are your thoughts it's something that at least people in the progressive move in the Democratic Party that I travel with have been on for quite some time I mean ever since the law changed in the in the 1990s and and we've gotten to this point where you know the teleca's kind of can can choke it and take control we've been worried right because net neutrality sounds like they somebody wants to for the net to be neutral but that's not it it's the opposite somebody's trying to make the net corporate controlled entirely and turn the internet effectively into HBO so everything all access to anything that you want to have access to is going to cost you money anything that is free is just going to be infomercials for potato soup or stuff that's completely worthless it's an argument that's a legitimate argument about throttling speed on the internet that you know first came up in the 90s and early 2000s when people pointed out that those that control the pipes could actually control the speed upon which you could get certain packets yes there's the issue a debate online between Richard Hart who's got a channel on YouTube because bitcoin is very deep philosophical thinker he's an influencer an influencer and he was talking to Bruce Fenton another Bitcoin er and they were having this debate and Bruce Fenton was saying no no we can't have the open free internet because that's like communism we need to assert our private property rights and be draconian and apply massive corporate power to this internet space your thoughts well let's just roll it back for a second and think about what the Internet has become I mean it was created by government investment the notion you know way back when when this this country really put R&D into things like that and it really came out of the military and it's an idea do you consider broadband to be a public utility Mac's so there's a robust debate on whether water and sewer for instance to be publicly owned or privately owned but the danger of turning it all into private hands is that people can then control something basic that you need water and in essence in the 21st century people need access free and open access to high-speed digital so you have problems all over this country right now where people are living on the equivalent of the information dirt road that last mile that's always discussed where the telcos of fought municipalities and counties for from providing it especially in this state that's a problem most of the places you go people actually are still getting substandard internet access now let me explain to me how this issues being framed because when I talked here people discussing and debating net neutrality they seemed to suggest that unless you let corporations dominate this space and turn it into something that's beyond the affordability of most people you end up with socialism but isn't it true it isn't the better case to make to say that if you allow unchecked corporate power to encroach on what should be a public utility and a public good you end up with the gas ovens you end up with fascism you end up with Nazism what your argument is basically saying that the natural state for monopolistic oligarchic capitalism is fascism yes and there's an awful lot of scholarship on that friend of mine Michael Roberto is working on a book dr. Roberto on exactly that topic that if it's unchecked which by the way Republicans and Democratic administrations in our country's history have fought against monopolies commands the Sherman Antitrust Act correct and we've actually taken a stand in the past for some reason over this last 30 35 years we haven't stood as strong or as tall in the saddle on this is another word for monopolies could be monarchy and didn't we find a Revolutionary War about that didn't we create the Constitution about that the Bill of Rights why I come nobody stands up for America when they are standing up for unchecked corporate power well you're you're making another point I've often made that the natural opponents of progressives are not conservatives conservatives have done an awful lot of good things in this country the natural opponent our monarchists and monarchist by and large are also closet fascists and you can go look at World War two who were the Nazis visiting in Britain it's one of those stories they don't want to tell they were visiting those that were connected to the monarchy right well in the banking industry was a huge support of fascism in Germany and across Europe so too were the unchecked corporate power of the Walt Disney Corporation the Ford Corporation and the coca-cola corporation and the IBM was also who do you think made the little digital tattoos in the concentration camp victims was provided for IBM IBM actually created a special orange drink for the Nazis called Fanta coca-cola right yeah who funded the freakin Nazis JPMorgan well there's another big supporter Walt Disney you're bringing up inconvenient truths that people don't want to talk about but I mean we talk about here in Pittsboro because Pittsboro and in durham and this area the country is a hotbed of liberal and progressive and political awareness of which you're at the forefront well people are willing here to ask these questions and these questions need to be asked you're right I mean who was involved I mean it connects to the Bush family I mean there's plenty of scholarship on their Braun and Harriman and others that were funding the Nazi regime it's just we don't like to quote talk about it in polite company let's talk about it you know it's an employed term in terms of baseball now the unchecked corporate fascist crowds that don't think net neutrality is a problem if you have corporations running the internet we tell us that there should never be referees on the game during a baseball match there should never be any rules there should never be any statistics there should never be any standings there should never be any attempt to quantify in any way what's happening on the baseball field or to officiate what's happening on the baseball field we should just let players go out there with balls and bats kill each other whoever survives that killing field is the winner of the World Series that's what that's what an hour anarcho-capitalism is telling us is the right way to go well another way of looking at it is they wouldn't want to pay the ballplayers so we just wouldn't pay labor but isn't that what's happening in places like Alabama which now has raw sewage spilling into people's homes calling hookworm Flint Michigan pipes full of carcinogenic water causing birth defects other places in Alabama where the local sewage is being underwritten by Wall Street banks to let it go bankrupt and end up people having to eat their own fecal matter to survive well I mean what you're basically talking about is the fact that America for decades has not focused on hard infrastructure really the things that we need to do in order to actually have civilization I mean you need to be able to provide clean potable water to your people you need to be able to process your waste which includes municipal solid waste as well as waste that would go into a wastewater treatment plant this is what you're referring to we have not been interested in it because it hasn't been sexy and then when Wall Street deemed it to be sexy they only did so to package what you know predatory products that they sold to municipalities and counties and they sold to institutional investors like CalPERS well look at Nestle corporation they tap into the aquifers the naturally occurring publicly owned Commonwealth and common good of an aquifer you're right that is that water back to us at a premium that they get for free so that's Nazism Nestle me so if Nestle we're in charge of the sewage systems and some of these municipalities they would sell people back their own fecal matter but branded as living life the Nestle Way eat your own poop and they'd get away with it in America I mean we all actually drink water that's coming from some source upstream so technically speaking that is the case I mean most these they sell bottled water actually are selling water that comes from a municipal plant right it's already actually processed water could come from the city of Durham here and then they put maximizers water so low is this the American Way or how much of this is the American Way right well I would say that it's not consistent with my understanding of what the American experience is all about my family's been on this fricking rock for 300 years you know we fought in every war except a Vietnam War and you know my family was in Pennsylvania and created the you know the the Lexington Gazette you know during the time of the Continental Congress where journalists go back that far and didn't have these idiots like out baldwin calling me at the american because i dare to tell the truth on this shadow at that time do you think they would have called your relatives the purveyors of faux news well you know at that time randy we know historically their third in America was against the independence right third was for it and a third was ambivalent well let me get your thought as a Democratic leader here in North Carolina many leading Democratic activists are suddenly in gay aged in this net neutrality issue but at the same time they are at the forefront of fighting to end net neutrality demanding that YouTube Facebook censor the videos they don't like both alt right and alt left have been demonetised and D ranked and now RT Russia today is also being in the crosshairs of these so-called progressives who are that who want to fight net neutrality but they want a censor journalist how do you square that circle this is an issue of not like quote not liking the contents I mean the question is when does the content become cancerous well there you don't need to for a content to be cancerous to defend the right to free speech you know it's the other years a free speech or not I mean is the limit if I shout fire in a crowded theater and there isn't a fire and people trample themselves to death that said like John McCain if there's a 1% chance that there's weapons of mass destruction in Iraq we have to kill a million people wearing at the same time so there's a 99% dead certainty a man-made global climate change and yet we feel that we don't have enough certainty to fight global climate change so you can go to either end of the bell curve and with the extreme of any argument but if you have free speech in a society that also values education and awareness that are open media you have a critical mass of educated people who can discern what is would-be crowd yelling fire in a crowded theater versus voicing an unpopular view that would encourage political debate I mean if you have a country of imbeciles who can't think for themselves then any speech is dangerous speech they only want to have free money pumped up their sphincters and to buy their opium on Amazon I think that the okay we gotta go Oh free speech man gotta cut you off that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report we Max Keiser and Stacy ever but I think just lack Randy bowler here in North Carolina if you want to reach us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye Oh
