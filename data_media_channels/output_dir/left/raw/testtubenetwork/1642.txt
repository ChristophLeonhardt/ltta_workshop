11
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:44,830
yesterday Trump got the number of voting

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,989
needed to secure the nomination which I

13
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,360
think none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us have expected you know</font>

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,199
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year ago let's say so I think part of</font>

15
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,210
the reason that people are saying he's

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,040
grown so much in popularity is that he

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,019
has a cult of personality now if you

18
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what a cult of personality is</font>

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's when a person uses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mass media to</font>

20
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:05,110
build up their image<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a heroic level</font>

21
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,540
where their flaws are ignored and their

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,840
virtues are hugely exemplified one of

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,940
the first times that this has happened

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,740
that in recent memory or not so recent

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,290
is the 1960 debate between Nixon and

26
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,150
Kennedy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a picture from</font>

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,280
that to show you to illustrate exactly

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,080
how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks so you know Nixon looks</font>

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
wiping the blood oh yeah he doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,000
good it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually right after this</font>

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
debate Nixon's mom called him and asked

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,970
him if he was sick that's true on the

33
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,820
other side you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kennedy who looks</font>

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,390
amazing it just is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a beautiful man dr.</font>

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">president's actual skin color at that</font>

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,250
point that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah I'm off yeah but so</font>

37
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,650
you know when you look at a picture like

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,570
that it sort of seems like the

39
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,760
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the two is not about</font>

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,610
politics it's about really how well

41
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,770
they're presenting and that's such a

42
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,220
huge part of a cult of personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

43
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,100
I think is you know translated through

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,750
the last 50 60<font color="#CCCCCC"> years since the invention</font>

45
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,000
tell ya it since television became the

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,150
mainstream for politics there anybody

47
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,519
else you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> can like roll out Lou was</font>

48
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,860
also the first televised presidential

49
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,299
debate I mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing</font>

50
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,549
that you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time instead</font>

51
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,680
of radio debates<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually seeing</font>

52
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,209
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically judging them on how</font>

53
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,799
tall they are what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're what's hi</font>

54
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,890
there wearing my language absolutely

55
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,470
yeah there's actually there's a it's

56
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,930
it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's not totally true</font>

57
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">but there</font>

58
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,930
study that came out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> said people who</font>

59
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">listened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the debate on the radio</font>

60
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,370
found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nixon won and watched on TV</font>

61
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,950
thought that Kennedy won right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

62
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,200
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was almost the launch of</font>

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,050
this sort of ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

64
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,440
personality through the media yep one of

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting about</font>

66
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,250
Trump as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> figurehead of a culture</font>

67
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,140
personality is that he's definitely a

68
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,700
new version of it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean obviously if</font>

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,440
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about using mass media to</font>

70
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,030
build up a person and create an image of

71
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,680
who you want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think they are</font>

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,730
whether they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like</font>

73
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,250
that heading up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reality show for a</font>

74
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,650
number of years that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty big and</font>

75
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,110
then also he's so different than people

76
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,690
like the leaders of North Korea where or

77
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,070
Stalin for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they'll</font>

78
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,650
attribute very specific qualities and

79
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,690
characteristics to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them like he has</font>

80
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,880
never bowled anything other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 or</font>

81
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,980
he goes every month that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he gives</font>

82
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,380
presents to the the town's folk which

83
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,630
they say about Stalin whereas with Trump

84
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,380
it's like he's rich and he wins and we

85
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,120
can mock his physical appearance and all

86
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,670
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's not actual life experience</font>

87
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,190
that that makes him rise up above other

88
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,440
people it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as general sense of he</font>

89
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">succeeded and he's saying this stuff i</font>

90
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,340
want to say but people call me racist

91
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,830
and I mean I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a</font>

92
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,080
hallmark in and of itself of somebody

93
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,330
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cult of personality where the the</font>

94
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,130
details don't matter as long as they

95
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,500
built themselves up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

96
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,290
people want to be a part of I you know

97
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,200
when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> George W Bush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was running for</font>

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,910
office I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of the most common</font>

99
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,250
thing said was uh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

100
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,870
have a beer with<font color="#CCCCCC"> him that's not a</font>

101
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,820
political<font color="#E5E5E5"> position but that's become</font>

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,640
what we look for in a president<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

103
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,930
pretty messed up since<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was recovering</font>

104
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,430
alcoholic but to your point Jules a

105
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,470
charm is always an important thing for

106
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">any facet of life charm could get you a</font>

107
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,920
lot of places if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have talent</font>

108
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,810
right and so for Trump I when I think of

109
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-loved presidents like Kennedy and</font>

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,980
Bill Clinton and Obama I think of them

111
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">as being very charismatic and charming</font>

112
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,540
truck doesn't have charm but something

113
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,070
is still really working out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for him</font>

114
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,110
right maybe just being loud<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not</font>

115
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,000
necessarily charming can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say that</font>

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this entire conversation it's all</font>

117
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,360
very meta and it kind of makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

118
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
to vomit in my mouth

119
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">because really it's the media also</font>

120
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,050
that's been so I'm like what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it about</font>

121
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,930
that racist you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so to me it's</font>

122
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,900
it's I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media really has played</font>

123
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,180
into it and it's being able to trump

124
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,250
love the bash us by the way people in

125
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,960
the media anyone who's covering him and

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,090
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time we and I would argue</font>

127
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,180
much more mainstream networks have made

128
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,150
him and it was funny I mean listen to

129
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the head of CBS right les Moonves said</font>

130
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,460
about Trump it might be bad for America

131
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,580
but it's damn good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> CBS now you have</font>

132
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,580
that the head<font color="#CCCCCC"> of CBS and a major</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

133
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,460
saying that like what is the role of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

134
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,500
media and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually hold back that</font>

135
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
cult of personality and say slow down we

136
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
need actually focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues here</font>

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,740
yeah we saw the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen you</font>

138
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,360
know in the UK in terms of the brexit

139
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,250
vote you know it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh we just</font>

140
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to follow this we're getting rating</font>

141
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,560
for getting rabies rating ratings and

142
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,660
then wait a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot to inform</font>

143
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,990
our viewers oh yeah that's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

144
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">think uh it's almost like the media is</font>

145
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,990
used more as a tool then I think a you

146
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,419
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the media trying not to cover</font>

147
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,130
certain subjects I mean one thing about

148
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,750
Trump that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is absolutely clear is that</font>

149
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,940
he's really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at getting media</font>

150
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,110
attention and that's something he's

151
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,460
doing intentionally it's not so much

152
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,530
that you know the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> is chasing after</font>

153
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,229
him waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for him to you know stumble</font>

154
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,000
or say something crazy he knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,380
that's why they're following him so

156
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,630
that's what he does he it's feeding the

157
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Beast I think there's a bit of that</font>

158
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,070
though we criticized on CIT how often

159
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">like Bernie Sanders would win a couple</font>

160
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">of primary elections and that night</font>

161
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,370
you'd flip to MSNBC and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

162
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,900
seeing Bernie speaking on the night of

163
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,120
his victories you'd see an empty Trump

164
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,160
podium yeah because they figured oh

165
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,140
that'll draw more people literally just

166
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,710
a block of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wood will draw more people</font>

167
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,660
but I will say though about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cult of</font>

168
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,520
personality it's a natural outgrowth of

169
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that we have celebrity worship</font>

170
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,210
and hero worship we worship our founding

171
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,979
fathers we worship our literal fathers

172
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,750
and mothers and we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that and it</font>

173
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,430
doesn't have to be a bad thing like

174
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,150
there's JFK a Reagan I guess I mean

175
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,080
these are guys that had cults of

176
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,270
personality but they also had policies

177
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,130
they had platforms they had things they

178
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,910
wanted to accomplish they were

179
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,470
relatively intellectual men maybe not

180
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,360
Reagan so much

181
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,090
but Trump just has the cult of

182
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,520
personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a wall and that's</font>

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,620
basically it and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see you</font>

184
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,020
get this<font color="#CCCCCC"> far without even like like</font>

185
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,150
Stalin wanted to collective eyes and he

186
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,830
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this crazy he had</font>

187
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,620
actual policies I also think it's safe I

188
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,840
mean I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry but like it is safe to</font>

189
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,129
cover this just a knee-jerk response or

190
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,349
some kind of crazy response oh my gosh

191
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,240
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you say about Mexicans Muslims</font>

192
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,039
this that of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should cover it</font>

193
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,110
of course you know you shouldn't let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

194
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,840
go but it's it's so much safer to cover

195
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,819
of candidate like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump watch I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

196
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say then to actually talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

197
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,219
issues and to talk about single-payer

198
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,990
health care and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about its folk</font>

199
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">so funny cuz Bernie was always like oh</font>

200
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,279
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy this crazy loon wants a</font>

201
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,870
single-payer<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare yeah that's</font>

202
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,879
never gonna happen some wants to build a

203
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,120
wall of Mexicans how's he gonna do that

204
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,610
where's it gonna find all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cement we</font>

205
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,379
must talk it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just like are you</font>

206
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,080
seeing me any and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it sells so</font>

207
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,060
much more to just cover the personality

208
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,509
cover the family cover Melania come you

209
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:09,210
know rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than actually covering the</font>

210
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,349
issues that's where things get dangerous

211
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,690
it wasn't a<font color="#CCCCCC"> refraction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of just the State</font>

212
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,550
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> America right now in social media if</font>

213
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,199
Trump is running for president<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

214
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,300
the age of social media would has impact

215
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,500
have been the same we're in a generation

216
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,599
where we worship people on social media

217
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,909
who don't do much vitac<font color="#E5E5E5"> selfies</font>

218
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,440
sometimes I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that everyone</font>

219
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,449
on social media is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but that is</font>

220
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">where our culture is hard work doesn't</font>

221
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,659
necessarily chalk up to the same success

222
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,190
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> did years ago and I feel like</font>

223
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why we are close to electic a man</font>

224
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,458
who is a social reality TV star it's a

225
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,198
slippery slope right<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz you're like oh</font>

226
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:43,049
man<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Trump now then Kardashian next</font>

227
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,000
like what if she<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to run for like</font>

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,660
that into existence I the inception but

229
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost because and I hate to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

230
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,370
this but politics is really boring and

231
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,660
you know what Trump is doing is I again

232
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,779
hate to say it polish<font color="#E5E5E5"> it go excited I've</font>

233
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,760
been a higher time like I've been one of

234
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,050
the biggest trump haters in the country

235
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,060
I don't find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting i find it to be</font>

236
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,430
an incredibly repetitive even inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

237
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,010
paragraphs he repeats himself so often<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

238
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,610
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only reason many people out</font>

239
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,320
they're watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> five to be exciting is</font>

240
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,880
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how boring other politicians</font>

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
are really i think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean if</font>

242
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,350
you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know people were</font>

243
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to be the nominee on the</font>

244
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,740
Republican side a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

245
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,019
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there had been one you</font>

246
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,810
know reasonable level headed person then

247
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,610
yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you woulda blown Trump out</font>

248
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,519
of the water but that didn't happen yeah

249
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,070
we know there it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think Jon</font>

250
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,360
Stewart said something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really</font>

251
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,220
resonated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me recently he said you</font>

252
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,519
know if basically Trump showed all these

253
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,320
politicians right<font color="#E5E5E5"> left Democrat</font>

254
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,940
Republican but he could just out

255
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,250
demagogue them he could just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go like</font>

256
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,680
speak louder than them be more extreme

257
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
than them and that's what happens when

258
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,490
you don't have actual policy or actual

259
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,440
leadership you get out demagogue you get

260
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,320
demagogues and and so how is we as

261
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,690
citizens as voters equip ourselves

262
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,880
against this demagoguery cuz it's scary

263
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,980
it really is and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not funny</font>

264
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore right and I think especially if</font>

265
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,510
you're Muslim you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

266
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,820
Mexican like these are not just words I

267
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,529
mean black lives matter protesters were

268
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,720
brutalized and have been brutalized the

269
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,990
immigrants have been brutalized because

270
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,699
verbatim Donald Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants you to go</font>

271
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,980
like this is for Donald Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> or says</font>

272
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,480
I'm bad right hell out of them i'll pay

273
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,850
your legal be very clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I mean</font>

274
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,199
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost that's almost I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

275
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:32,120
saddest thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in spite of all that</font>

276
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,550
he's still you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're saying</font>

277
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,260
the media is continuing to cover him it

278
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,709
almost feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a like a</font>

279
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,970
self-fulfilling cycle it's a self

280
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,860
running machine well<font color="#E5E5E5"> also though I mean</font>

281
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,720
we have to acknowledge in all cult of

282
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,220
personality the stuff that rises to that

283
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,709
level the danger is that the leader is

284
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,420
inoculated against criticism for the

285
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,970
most part of dissenting voices are

286
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,190
drowned out that's the danger but not

287
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call to first cults of personality</font>

288
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,670
are built in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way like we've had</font>

289
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,519
Obama who had one I was a devotee of it

290
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,430
since 2004 even Bernie Sanders to some

291
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,260
extent as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt a personality and so</font>

292
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,640
does Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're not built on the</font>

293
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,709
same thing I mean Obama had posters that

294
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,750
said hope and change it was positive

295
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,670
feelings about how we can improve the

296
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,380
world we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we can take ourselves out</font>

297
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,120
of these unnecessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wars stop killing</font>

298
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,829
civilians those are positive things

299
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,810
Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a cult of personality but it</font>

300
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,940
ain't positive no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

301
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,459
that that's not even necessarily a

302
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:26,830
factor of I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

303
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,390
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stalin had a cult of</font>

304
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,430
personality and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard a lot of</font>

305
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,650
comparisons between Trump and Silvio

306
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,870
Berlusconi who they both you know they

307
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,850
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out of money and and aren't</font>

308
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,030
beholden to anyone both say pretty crazy

309
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,370
things do pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy things yeah um</font>

310
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,740
Mussolini also another time Mussolini

311
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,050
another Italian adores I'm and and

312
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,570
Mussolini had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human he loved to put on</font>

313
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,520
a big show we you know we were looking

314
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,770
at old newsreels during that time right

315
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,510
and the newscast was like one thing

316
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,520
about Mussolini he knows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put on a</font>

317
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,200
good show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there is like</font>

318
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
goose-stepping it's like yeah and then

319
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,440
it's like some people think Mussolini

320
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,720
will be less dangerous in office or this

321
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,370
is about Hitler so I'm saying is

322
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,130
demagogues and authoritarians I know

323
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,170
hold your personalities right throughout

324
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,500
time I've always been said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

325
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,060
when you talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trump supporters they</font>

326
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,340
say the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing he doesn't mean it</font>

327
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,800
you know I know he said those things

328
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,710
about women he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it he does</font>

329
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,650
in like because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow i think is John</font>

330
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,110
you said there's a hypnosis where it's

331
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,170
like somehow people think they know him

332
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,420
they think they see his<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he doesn't</font>

333
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,310
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know what's incredible about</font>

334
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,740
that is there's a psychological term

335
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,540
called a pair of social interaction

336
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,960
which is where it's a one directional

337
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
interaction so something like a person

338
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,770
watching a TV so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you only get</font>

339
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,120
the host or the ER guess whatever

340
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,640
talking to you but by using certain

341
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hughes by by watching long enough it</font>

342
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,930
begins to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a two-way</font>

343
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,490
interaction you begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel like you</font>

344
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">can identify and associate with the</font>

345
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,340
people on screen and that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

346
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,110
know psychological concept builds a

347
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,330
relationship in your brain where you

348
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,740
know you'll watch something and you'll

349
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch Trump and you know some people</font>

350
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,640
will say oh I get him I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know him I</font>

351
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,650
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like you know I would be</font>

352
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,000
hanging out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him now that's what I</font>

353
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's confusing to me because I</font>

354
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,970
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can look at a president like</font>

355
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,580
Obama and a lot of like young black kids

356
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,930
can look at him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be like oh he's just</font>

357
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">like me he loves basketball he loves</font>

358
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,680
hip-hop he hangs out with jay-z maybe I

359
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,540
can grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to be like him what does the</font>

360
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,540
common American see with average

361
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,560
American see that they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in common</font>

362
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">with Donald Trump you just a really</font>

363
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,800
really rich man

364
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
he's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> richer and richer by the</font>

365
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,160
second I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't see what it is that</font>

366
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,620
they connect with unfortunate so when

367
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially was was born rich was handed</font>

368
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,519
million-dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> like he works his way up</font>

369
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,350
so there's a connection there his son

370
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,690
who spoke last night was given a winery

371
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,490
to run but this is the guy that speaking

372
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,160
for the common man I mean the wine art

373
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,470
from the body now you can say well look

374
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,480
he started where I was and look where he

375
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,850
ended up truck was given wealth beyond

376
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,140
imagination right um uh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking</font>

377
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this one woman at the GOP California</font>

378
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">convention and you know she said</font>

379
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think maybe some women</font>

380
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,800
there resonates with him which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

381
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,190
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he's a big strong man he's</font>

382
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,529
gonna shake she said those words he's I

383
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,060
think he's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care of us you</font>

384
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,760
know he's big and strong and it was like

385
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,370
honey don't give away your power like

386
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I mean she was an older woman</font>

387
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,450
sure and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's just a big</font>

388
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,120
strong man who's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of us I</font>

389
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,620
also think in his corporate buddies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

390
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,370
what what John's against the cult of

391
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,750
personality I think one of the most

392
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting things about it is it has to</font>

393
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,620
live in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> duality where on the one</font>

394
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,320
hand you're a hero worship figure on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

395
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,610
other hand you relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the common man</font>

396
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah and there are so many factors that</font>

397
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,100
go into that that it's it's I mean

398
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,810
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the people that we've seen</font>

399
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,579
that are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that candidates are we see</font>

400
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">none like that do fulfill that role it</font>

401
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,250
is almost a prerequisite but getting to

402
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,579
it is it's clearly a false narrative you

403
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:11,620
can't really be both you can't identify

404
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,240
with the common man and<font color="#E5E5E5"> own a winery</font>

405
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,300
what let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just talk about Bernie</font>

406
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,890
Sanders honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is where you</font>

407
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,170
gotta hand it to Bernie I mean the dude

408
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,199
created a cult of personality around his

409
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,570
anti cult of personality he never<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

410
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,279
to talked about his never wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

411
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> his personal life never wanted to</font>

412
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of you know you know banter with</font>

413
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,579
people he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the issues and yet</font>

414
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,040
people found a way to worship this you

415
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,920
know crazed haired old you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Joey</font>

416
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,930
grandpa that leg<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like they're like</font>

417
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,930
lovey Jewish vampires like man and and

418
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's amazing to me um you know he's</font>

419
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,079
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexy you didn't want to put him on</font>

420
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">boy and what with him I think he</font>

421
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,160
from the fact that the people who were

422
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,100
so attracted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama like I know I felt</font>

423
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Obama was one thing during the</font>

424
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,910
campaign and he's been a fine president

425
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,230
but he wasn't what I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font>

426
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be at the time so all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

427
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,950
hopes and expectations were waiting for

428
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fill them and so what</font>

429
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,790
worries me about Trump is if he doesn't

430
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,500
become president all of those people

431
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,120
have now been activated the ones who

432
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,040
love Trump and there might be another

433
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,540
politician who would for eight years

434
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,910
slides into that spot could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

435
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,920
that's horrifying but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

436
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,970
thing you said about relating to the

437
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,190
common man I was doing research for this

438
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,870
talk and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so interesting</font>

439
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,640
reading about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stalin in particular</font>

440
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,890
because the media would always focus at

441
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time about the fact that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would he</font>

442
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,010
would correspond via a letter with

443
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,720
peasants and he would literally give

444
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,190
presents and stuff like that he talked

445
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them directly and what his Trump dude</font>

446
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,230
Trump retweets any moron who sends a

447
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,899
sweet to him and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that person it says</font>

448
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,880
oh he touched me he blessed me by

449
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,490
putting my<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands right and there's an</font>

450
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,990
excuse to back away from the horrendous

451
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,700
things well I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it what am I</font>

452
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,649
like supporters it and I just retweet it

453
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,110
wasn't me yeah yeah sit easy cop out for

454
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,360
him as well amazing well there's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

455
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,899
there's also this idea that actors and

456
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,349
reality TV stars you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

457
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,050
higher level of access to build a cult

458
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,540
of personality I mean a Reagan a

459
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,530
Schwarzenegger prompt it's it's very

460
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,179
seemingly easier to bridge that gap when

461
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,260
you already have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience and</font>

462
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,369
imagine if the rock ever runs for

463
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,280
president I would definitely vote for

464
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,050
the rock no question would totally go i

465
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,679
endorsing the rough right now that would

466
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">be amazing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um and see I have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

467
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">we would do as president but I genuinely</font>

468
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Amit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i love the wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would just like</font>

469
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and people feel that way about</font>

470
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,059
Trump yeah unfortunately you know I

471
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,230
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's interesting about this</font>

472
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,780
election itself is it really may come

473
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,900
down to do I like this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do I</font>

474
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,740
not and Trump the you know what his base

475
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,500
is saying is I really really like him

476
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,720
whereas what Hillary's base is saying is

477
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,140
I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to like her and it's it's</font>

478
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,750
a difficult crap it's a difficult thing

479
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,120
to overcome is when you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

480
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
there's there's the

481
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,029
Ernie bros who are you know haven't

482
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,350
decided which direction are going to go

483
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">um you know especially leaving the the</font>

484
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bernie cult of personality and Hillary's</font>

485
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,059
is I think a lot less strong even though

486
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:19,370
she's been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for so long she</font>

487
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,870
just doesn't even sound like she

488
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,639
believes what she's saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wish</font>

489
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I oh I I'm interested to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

490
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,710
know come<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNC like if she can give a</font>

491
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,419
speech where I actually believe what

492
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,710
she's saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't say that as a</font>

493
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,740
as an insult I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being kind of</font>

494
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,389
objectively I mean she doesn't sound

495
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:40,159
like she believes herself and I don't

496
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,200
know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh and i think that's</font>

497
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,179
interesting some voters in New Hampshire

498
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,200
know if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ever talked to New</font>

499
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hampshire voters um because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such a small</font>

500
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,639
state a lot of the candidates will go

501
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:52,100
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people oh yeah you know i'm</font>

502
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,409
at cruise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm at Busch I met Clinton</font>

503
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've personally met these candidates</font>

504
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,460
because it's real you're fighting for

505
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,110
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote and then you ask him</font>

506
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,059
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gonna vote for and since</font>

507
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,259
they have open primaries it can be

508
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,570
anyone they and they're like I don't

509
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">know yet you know I'm gonna wait and see</font>

510
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,340
what my gut tells me or like well you

511
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,919
know I love Bernie's policies but when I

512
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,620
shook his hand he looked away a little

513
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,559
too suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy where's Clinton why</font>

514
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,450
here I've never met her I don't know if

515
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,580
you guys have I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's in person</font>

516
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,220
very warm actually so maybe on stage

517
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,379
it's not there but like when you need

518
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,750
hurts she connect bill had that too sad

519
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">face yeah they say bill yeah but that is</font>

520
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,009
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest criticisms of Hillary</font>

521
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,419
is that she doesn't seem trustworthy

522
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:38,299
which is almost kind of hilarious when

523
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,610
it's against Trump completely her hair

524
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,309
is not almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hilarious</font>

525
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:44,600
completely outrageous I think honestly

526
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that she's not a trustworthy the right</font>

527
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">lamb i'll see ya know we see our</font>

528
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:49,370
audience when they react to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything we</font>

529
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,049
post about Hillary or trumpets the same

530
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,000
thing they go for her you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

531
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,679
jugular<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust her and they</font>

532
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,509
call her names but I'm like at the same

533
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,950
time we have Donald Trump who literally

534
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,240
will say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you right now</font>

535
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,669
they'll fact check it and prove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

536
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:02,809
lied and he'll pretend it never happened

537
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,419
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get some eyes only one of</font>

538
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,340
these people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I can't wrap my</font>

539
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,139
head around that I like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

540
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,330
being critical of a politician for their

541
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,860
trustworthiness I just wish that they

542
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,750
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more generally critical right</font>

543
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,370
like you could identify that there's

544
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone who doesn't stick with what they</font>

545
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,100
say they're gonna do or they receive

546
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,970
donations and it's

547
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,830
like they then do with that interest

548
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,690
once but a lot of politicians do you

549
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,830
should be able to recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

550
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,750
others yeah she hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

551
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,790
develop a girl to filter personality in

552
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,880
some ways if people do move over to her

553
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,350
it will probably represent something

554
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,930
better that she has made promises and

555
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,850
it'll be based on the policies that's

556
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,380
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would hope of course since she's</font>

557
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,300
going up against another guy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dark</font>

558
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,150
mirror of a cult of personality we might

559
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,700
never know but yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think</font>

560
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,980
I think it's better to vote based on the

561
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,260
the policies i don't i supported Bernie

562
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,350
Sanders I I don't like her generally but

563
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,820
as of right now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for her</font>

564
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,290
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Supreme</font>

565
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,480
Court<font color="#CCCCCC"> and environment and tax policy and</font>

566
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,090
things like that pish posh well in the

567
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,620
conversation all they would like the

568
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,380
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think</font>

569
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,910
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is that the</font>

570
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation has so thoroughly shifted</font>

571
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,130
away from policy where I mean like Trump

572
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,770
doesn't have policy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know beyond the</font>

573
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,760
wall and his supporters don't care and I

574
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,370
wonder if you know we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> we this</font>

575
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,380
almost feels like maximum cult of

576
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,610
personality at this point where we've

577
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,580
gone from you know Kennedy who had good

578
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,000
ideas oh my god even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Abraham Lincoln was</font>

579
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,830
how to call to personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you know</font>

580
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,650
big guy you know toads stovepipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> hat</font>

581
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,590
telling stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the campfire kind</font>

582
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,510
of thing Jeff you Joker you know yes

583
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,780
this huge legacy and today we're looking

584
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,790
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump and it's almost like that's the</font>

585
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,590
that's the you know brick wall that

586
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,100
we've hit I wonder if we can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

587
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that or maybe but you know if Trump</font>

588
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,030
will get us away from that inadvertently

589
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,770
where we realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

590
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,590
happens when you glorify a you know a

591
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,690
celebrity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of a you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

592
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,310
presidential nomination I mean and

593
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the media also</font>

594
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,310
like it's at a certain point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of</font>

595
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,780
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like three or four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

596
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago they were like oh my goodness what</font>

597
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">have we done oh no oh this is real and</font>

598
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm like wait wait oh we should fact</font>

599
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,570
check and they started like even running

600
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,790
headlines like you know like Trump says

601
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,130
that you know Mexicans take five so

602
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,780
yesterday which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not true and then</font>

603
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,340
they like have to like you know write it

604
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,090
or whatever he said they felt obligated

605
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,800
finally to have to fact-check it and

606
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,840
again back to like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

607
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,630
horns of having the media can both build

608
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,750
these people up but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also their role is</font>

609
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,880
to interrogate them right and and to

610
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,669
bring it back to policy yeah absolutely

611
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:44,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah I think to bring back to what I</font>

612
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:46,789
said before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason that we</font>

613
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:49,130
have that is because even though we can

614
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,750
make mobile phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can send</font>

615
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,730
drones to Mars we still have involved

616
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,159
that much more simple creatures and I

617
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:56,539
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we develop cult of</font>

618
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,250
personality and vote for our political

619
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,570
leadership based on those the same

620
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that I cannot go to a supermarket</font>

621
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,590
and check out<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sink without seeing</font>

622
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,120
a magazine about who which celebrity

623
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,309
couple just<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a baby we get to focus</font>

624
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:08,899
on individuals that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know we're</font>

625
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,610
not going to ever know they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

626
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,740
in common with us and we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

627
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,330
to look at the effect that they would

628
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,970
have as a leader and until we stop it so

629
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,350
we're able to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> past these</font>

630
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,760
characteristics that don't have anything

631
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do with legislating I think that</font>

632
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,409
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run into trouble at least</font>

633
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:26,570
in 48 years when Donald Trump jr. runs

634
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,210
for presidency didn't you see that like

635
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,100
that too<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was watching him speak I</font>

636
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,450
kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> on hearing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Godfather just like</font>

637
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,279
well with Trump in that doorway that's

638
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,679
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perfect Freddie Mercury no</font>

639
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,090
less oh right I wonder if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

640
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rise of the Internet it almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feels</font>

641
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,529
like that should have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution</font>

642
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cult of personality</font>

643
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,130
because now you're not just sitting and

644
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,419
watching someone like you're saying it's

645
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,399
quickly fat check the policies are there

646
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,350
they're thrown on screen you know we're

647
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,460
able to the candidates can't just sell

648
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,230
themselves anymore because of how much

649
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,350
outside free information there is but

650
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,820
somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't seem to evade a</font>

651
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,710
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> i well there's really</font>

652
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,570
competing pressures I think you have the

653
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,669
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fact-check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you have to</font>

654
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:15,620
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the curiosity in the drive to fact</font>

655
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,020
check if you see a meme<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it confirms</font>

656
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,820
everything you believe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be true a</font>

657
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,740
picture or something you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-click</font>

658
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,059
and you can google search and you can

659
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,500
see when it was originally posted like

660
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,690
Melania Trump she plagiarized from

661
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,940
michelle obama but Donald Trump did not

662
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,470
send out a tweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was exactly the</font>

663
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,270
same as what Barack said after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michelle</font>

664
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Obama spoke because I did the research</font>

665
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,960
it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually true you have to be</font>

666
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,610
willing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

667
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,830
provides all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these diverse forms</font>

668
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,289
sources of information but the cult of

669
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,880
personality relies on controlling a

670
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,440
message and there's so much information

671
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you</font>

672
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,130
in and indeed have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose selectively</font>

673
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,200
which to listen to and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can</font>

674
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,090
segregate themselves because they don't

675
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get whatever news available</font>

676
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,350
they can get all a specific type of news

677
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so much of it now and then</font>

678
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,500
to me honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at Trump versus</font>

679
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,240
Sanders and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that they played the</font>

680
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,860
media it was very interesting like I

681
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,990
said and I will reiterate covering

682
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,750
Trump's one-liners ridiculous hateful

683
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know in Maine one-liners is much</font>

684
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,120
safer and gave them you know mainstream

685
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,010
networks much more fodder than covering

686
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,799
Bernie Sanders actual policies but what

687
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,630
do they do Sanders knew he wasn't gonna

688
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,549
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coverage Trump was gonna do was</font>

689
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:24,679
gonna get and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about to like go</font>

690
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:26,779
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know Rosie O'Donnell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font>

691
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:28,970
get it yeah so what'd he<font color="#E5E5E5"> do he just kept</font>

692
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,399
on saying the same thing over and over

693
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,950
and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again hoping that maybe if he</font>

694
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,260
got like you know three percent or two

695
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,090
percent of the coverage maybe some of

696
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would enter into America's like</font>

697
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">consciousness so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people say oh yeah</font>

698
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,309
he repeated the same thing again it's

699
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well his odds you know him though</font>

700
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,049
don't you what I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

701
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,880
kids really do love Bernie so even if it

702
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,350
came off as repetitive I think his

703
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,399
technique actually did work

704
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:54,350
unfortunately not enough that he's gonna

705
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,539
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nomination but um again our</font>

706
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:59,570
viewers love Bernie he's like by far<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

707
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,860
candidate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they connect with because</font>

708
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,929
they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's authentic he really</font>

709
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,460
cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the issues he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about</font>

710
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,559
policies so I guess it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> encouraging to</font>

711
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,000
know that some people out there still do

712
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,350
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because they love Bernie</font>

713
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are still was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there any hope</font>

714
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,250
for him can<font color="#E5E5E5"> he be VP can you overthrow</font>

715
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,899
Hillary somehow and like I said with the

716
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:17,840
anti personality with but I mean the

717
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,360
guys got a huge personality but yeah I

718
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,809
know he wasn't taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> selfies and you</font>

719
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,700
know that's such a big criticism of

720
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,289
Hillary that she's always trying to

721
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:29,480
pander for that cult of personality<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

722
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing up on uh you know Ellen doing</font>

723
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,720
like dad dancing like it's it's a

724
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,659
painful it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of painful to</font>

725
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:41,270
watch because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know honestly my heart</font>

726
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,830
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do you really want to like her</font>

727
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,429
but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard because it feels it</font>

728
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:49,250
just comes at you in in in not a real

729
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,720
way not a genuine way in the way that

730
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,700
Bernie Sanders does yeah I have to

731
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,230
choose your battles I gotta give Trump

732
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,970
tried to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and dance to Ellen it</font>

733
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,919
would be grotesque<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he doesn't choose</font>

734
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that he instead</font>

735
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,500
tweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Starkey people like it and if</font>

736
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,940
you're trying to develop a cult of

737
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,320
personality like there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

738
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,539
different ways you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it on Twitter</font>

739
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:10,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you can try to project strength by</font>

740
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,799
just insulting people and attacking

741
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,539
people and some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will look at that</font>

742
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,490
and say he's a big strong man who's

743
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of us whereas Bernie</font>

744
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:19,570
who is also incredibly popular in social

745
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,669
media he just put simple tweets

746
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,190
expressing a value or an aspiration or a

747
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,380
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing that people on social media</font>

748
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,110
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to show who they are</font>

749
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,940
they want to affiliate themselves or

750
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">wits with a better messaged version of</font>

751
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,279
their hopes and dreams and so he got a

752
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,220
huge amount of reach on twitter by doing

753
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,600
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say that that's the</font>

754
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,340
more positive form of it yeah it's

755
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,429
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> depressing that you know somebody</font>

756
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">who really does seem like they're</font>

757
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,490
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a campaign of integrity who</font>

758
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,380
actually has a message<font color="#CCCCCC"> who actually as</font>

759
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,200
policy uh and and he's putting it in an

760
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,110
easily digestible form is still unable

761
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,269
to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage you know now to get</font>

762
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:00,070
the nomination will see you next week

763
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,269
but right yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it ain't over a</font>

764
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:09,429
yeah it'll run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

765
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">realized right now on this live stream</font>

766
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,779
yeah i mean it's it's definitely I think

767
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,320
it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> says that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there yet</font>

768
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,029
that were that legitimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,519
candidate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pure integrity who</font>

771
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,929
isn't trying to become a cult of

772
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:30,820
personality who you know Bernie has a

773
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,529
great team behind him but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

774
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:34,090
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like he was ever you know really</font>

775
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,120
reaching for that uh you know godlike

776
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,639
status or hero worship he it seems like

777
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:43,000
he kind of just came in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

778
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,799
know said what he believes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

779
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,950
supported you know by years and years of

780
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,750
experience uh when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't have</font>

781
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,299
hashtag I'm with her yeah not<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

782
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody so you know flaw I don't know</font>

783
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,880
what we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to see how you know</font>

784
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,769
culture personalities<font color="#E5E5E5"> originate you know</font>

785
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,330
over the next few elections you know how

786
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,159
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know works out for Trump and</font>

787
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,659
you have any final thoughts uh my final

788
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,240
thought is that you're never<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get</font>

789
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">rid of the cult of personality and it's</font>

790
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,030
about wielding I think

791
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,700
is about I mean the oh wait Obama

792
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,350
campaign is a perfect example of

793
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,210
something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> positive</font>

794
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,760
like we were saying obviously the dude

795
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,790
is charismatic as is all hell and that

796
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">helps but it's about wielding it</font>

797
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,050
responsibly and it's about everyone

798
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,970
putting that personality into check

799
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,320
right and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're saying</font>

800
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,300
does it is this the person who can

801
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually lead our country and yeah yeah</font>

802
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,710
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you just be willing to be</font>

803
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,330
critical of the people around<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

804
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,440
doesn't matter if it's like someone you

805
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
just had a first date with or if they're

806
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,680
running for president like<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody's</font>

807
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect and being willing to admit their</font>

808
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,640
flaws doesn't make them weaker everybody

809
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,650
thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if they're willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say I</font>

810
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,330
don't agree with this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter</font>

811
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,820
then I'm not pure I'm not part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

812
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">crowd I want to be a part of but I think</font>

813
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,830
I think love that's based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on an actual</font>

814
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,290
understanding of what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is</font>

815
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,150
better than just a child's understanding

816
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,040
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people right now have a</font>

817
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,780
child's understanding and adoration of

818
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,270
Donald Trump yeah well I do hope that

819
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,860
people go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and vote him before they</font>

820
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,170
vote they do research both candidates

821
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and learn the things that they stand for</font>

822
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,230
because that's what matters but at the

823
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,210
same time I do personally hope that

824
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,950
Hilary finds her swag that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

825
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,570
way that I can put it because I don't

826
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's as difficult as we think it</font>

827
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,960
is remember a few weeks ago when<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

828
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,580
told Donald Trump to delete this Twitter

829
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,790
account that one tweet was huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

830
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,620
like our Hilary I see you being a person

831
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,210
and stepping up and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it should</font>

832
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take some more small steps like</font>

833
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,820
that it would go a really long way for

834
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,260
her more tweets I think that's

835
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,900
