he was one of the original American

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,309
spark a revolution one that challenged
the nation's views on sexuality I have

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,519
celebrated the romantic connection
between the sexes and that's part of

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,619
what play was all about Hugh M Hefner
who liked to be called Hef was born in

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,570
Chicago in 1926 and raised in what he
said was a strict household by

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,949
conservative Protestant parents I felt
there was something more to life than

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,340
the world I saw around me in 1953 with
just $8,000 the aspiring publisher

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,899
produced the very first issue of Playboy
magazine on the kitchen table of his

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,149
Chicago apartment the cover featured a
photo of Marilyn Monroe and sold more

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,789
than 50,000 copies when it hit
newsstands in December of 1953 Hefner

11
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,530
now had the funds to finance another
issue and the Playboy Empire was born

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,969
well I have never really thought of
playboy as a sex magazine yeah what I've

13
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,600
tried to do is create a lifestyle
magazine for men Hefner divorced his

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,490
wife Mildred Williams in 1959 and during
the early days of the magazine success

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,869
decided he would not only promote the
fantasy he helped create but he would

16
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,350
live it as well
audience has got a taste of Hefner's

married Playmate of the Year
Kimberly Conrad the couple had two

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,460
