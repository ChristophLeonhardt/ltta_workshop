HEAR THE STATEMENT AND THINK ABOUT ITS IMPLICATIONS.

62
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,119

THOUGHT, IN A WAY IT’S A SHAME TO HAVE TO PIVOT FROM THAT TO

68
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,362
TO HAVE TO PIVOT FROM THAT TO DISCUSS A MAN OF CHARACTER AND

69
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,363
DISCUSS A MAN OF CHARACTER AND COURAGE AND HONOR AND SOMEONE I

00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,071
NOT SO BAD TO HAVE THE CONTRAST. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE REST OF

00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,016
ABOUT THE OCCASIONAL COMPROMISES OF JOHN McCAIN.

HIGHER VIEW OF WHAT AMERICA IS. MAYBE THAT WOULD BE NOT A BAD

124
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,690
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE NOT A BAD THING FOR PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON

125
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:42,724
THING FOR PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON TODAY AND IN THE COMING DAYS.

126

BEEN LESS PROUD OF AND FAILURES IN HIS LIFE THAT HE WOULD BE THE

136
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,541
IN HIS LIFE THAT HE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT.
