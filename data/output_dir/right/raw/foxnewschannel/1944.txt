1
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:10,953
>> Bret: LET'S GET SOME

2
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:12,021
PERSPECTIVE NOW AND INSIDE ARE

3
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:13,055
THE STORIES THAT WE BROUGHT YOU

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,623
BEFORE THE BREAK.

5
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,192
IF THE NORTH KOREA HOSTAGE

6
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:19,061
SETTLEMENTS AND WHAT GAMES COMES

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,998
NEXT, THE IRAN DEAL AND OTHER

8
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:23,332
STORIES.

9
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:25,634
BRIT HUME JOINS US.

10
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,870
YOUR THOUGHTS ON, THIS IS A BIG

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,472
DEVELOPMENT WITH THESE THREE

12
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:30,239
AMERICANS LANDING TONIGHT OR

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,073
EARLY THIS MORNING, BUT IT IS

14
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,443
SETTING THE TABLE FOR WHAT THE

15
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:35,611
PRESIDENT HOPES WILL BE

16
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:36,345
SOMETHING BIGGER.

17
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:37,947
>> INDEED, AND YOU HAVE THE

18
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:39,014
PRESIDENT NOW BEING CONFRONTED

19
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:41,050
WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE

20
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,651
IS A LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR THE

21
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,053
NOBEL PRIZE.

22
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:45,654
TO SOME EXTENT, AT LEAST HE HAS

23
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:46,489
PUSHED BACK AGAINST THAT IDEA

24
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,057
BUT I THINK HE REALLY DOES

25
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:51,727
OBVIOUSLY HOPE THAT THIS WAS

26
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:53,796
GOING TO TURN INTO AN AGREEMENT,

27
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:55,397
INCREDIBLE ENFORCEABLE AND

28
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:58,801
VERIFIABLE AGREEMENT ON THE DUDE

29
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,170
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

30
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,072
PENINSULA WHICH WOULD BE A HUGE

31
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:03,606
ACHIEVEMENT.

32
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,441
NOW THIS THING THAT HAPPENED

33
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,042
TODAY, THE RETURN OF THESE

34
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,878
HOSTAGES, IT IS IMPORTANT IN THE

35
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:13,182
SENSE THAT IT WASN'T VERY MANY

36
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:15,417
MONTHS AGO, BRET, THAT PEOPLE

37
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:18,387
WERE SAYING THAT WITH HIS SABER

38
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:19,388
RATTLING AND BELLICOSE ATTITUDE,

39
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:21,323
HE WAS BRINGING US TO THE BRINK

40
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:22,258
OF WAR.

41
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:25,661
WE HEARD THAT A LOT, AND LOOK

42
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:26,896
WHERE WE ARE NOW.

43
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,797
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE ARE HEADED TO

44
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,466
THE LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY OVER

45
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,668
THERE BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT

46
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:36,071
ACHIEVEMENT TO GET THIS FAR.

47
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:37,606
OBVIOUSLY, LOTS OF REMAINS TO BE

48
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:37,907
SEEN.

49
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:40,242
>> Bret: THE OTHER BIG NUCLEAR

50
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:42,378
ISSUE ON IRONIC, IT SEEMS THAT

51
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:43,846
EUROPEANS ARE TRYING TO TALK TO

52
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:45,881
IRAN SEPARATE FROM THE U.S.

53
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:48,050
PULLING OUT OF THIS DEAL BUT IT

54
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,386
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A REALISTIC

55
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:51,053
PLOT PROSPECT.

56
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:54,256
>> THE KEY QUESTION HERE IS, HOW

57
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,425
MUCH DIFFERENCE TO IRAN WILL THE

58
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,761
RE-IMPOSITION OF AMERICAN

59
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,195
SANCTIONS MAKE.

60
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:03,032
THE AMERICAN BANKING SYSTEM IS

61
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:05,234
CENTRAL TO THE WHOLE ECONOMY.

62
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:08,070
OUR ALLIES DON'T WANT TO RUN

63
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,810
AFOUL OF THAT EITHER, AND THAT

64
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,182
MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO IRAN

65
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,252
AND TO OUR ALLIES.

66
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,954
AND WE CAN'T TELL THEM NOW.

67
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:27,523
A LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU HEAR PEOPLE

68
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,857
FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

69
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,427
SAYING, THIS IS A DISASTER.

70
00:02:31,427 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL THE CYCLES ARE OFF, AND I'M
