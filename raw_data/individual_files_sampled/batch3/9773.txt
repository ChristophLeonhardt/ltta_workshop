THE S, JILLIAN: CIRCULATE MORE THAN 150 MILES AN HOUR, SAME VERTICAL WINDS TUNNELS TO TRAIN THE MILITARY. ROB: INDOOR SKY DIVING IS WHAT'S IT'S CALLED. JILLIAN: TODD PIRO CHECKED IT OUT WHEN HE CHECKED OUT THE SKYDIVING CHAMPIONSHIP, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I LOOK LIKE A BEACH DOLPHIN. LITERALLY SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET AND WE HEADED DOWN THERE TO COMPETITION MILITARY AND TAKING MORE THAN JUST HOT AIR, CHECK IT OUT. ♪ ♪ WHAT IS THIS? INDOOR SKYDIVING, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF IT? I HAVE NOT. 350 HORSE POWER FANS ON THE TOP OF OUR BUILDING THAT WE CIRCULATE AIR, 150 MILES AN HOUR. YOU READY? I'M READY. ♪ OUR CEO DREAMT UP THIS IDEA. KNIVES THE NAVY FOR 26 YEARS, NAVY SPECIAL OPERATIONS. YOU'RE USED TO DEALING WE USE TODAY TRAVEL TO FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE WOULD SAY WHY ISN'T THERE A VERTICAL TUNNEL. WHILE MAY LOOK LIKE FUN AND HAVING FUN AT COMPETITION, THIS IS A TRAINING TOOL TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE. I WAS A NAVY AND WE BASICALLY STARTED OUT WITH TUNNEL, GIVES US THE TOOLS WE NEED TO COMPLETE MISSIONS WITHOUT ANY HAZARD. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART OF THIS IN. CHILDREN ARE THE BEST THING THAT HAPPEN IN THIS BUILDING EVERY SINGLE DAY, FAR NONE. WHAT'S IT LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TUNNEL? IT'S SUPER FUN, IT'S LIKE A RUSH. WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST PIECE OF ADVICE FOR ME? LISTEN TO INSTRUCTOR AND HAVE FUN. IF I HAVE FUN, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS? YEAH. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT. ♪ ♪ THE FIRST THING WE WILL DO IS TALK ABOUT OUR BODY. OKAY. GOOD JOB, YOU'RE DOING GREAT, ARE YOU READY TO FLY? LET'S DO IT. ♪ ♪ I'M GEARED UP. 3, 2, 1. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ THAT WAS AWESOME. I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY. VIRGINIA BEACH IS YOUR SECOND HOME NOW. WE ARE HERE THE USA CHAMP IN THIS AMAZING SPORT. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO BE HERE. THE OWNER BOB HAS BEEN GENEROUS TO US. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO BE PART OF THIS. DEFINITELY SPIRIT THAT CONSUMES EVERYBODY WHEN YOU'RE AROUND MILITARY PEOPLE. THE SAME SPIRIT THAT I SAW WITH THE INDIVIDUALS HERE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. I'M A MEMBER OF A BROTHERHOOD THAT WILL LAST FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THE SUPPORT WHEN I HAD WHEN IT WAS AN IDEA UP UNTIL TODAY IS INCREDIBLE TO BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN ARMS. THERE'S A CHARITABLE ASPECT ON ALL OF THIS, DONATING HOURS IN THE TUNNELS TO KIDS, ALSO THE FOLKS AT ANOTHER VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESS, SEAN IS FREQUENTLY ON OUR AIR, THEY SPONSOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP, WHERE THE FOLKS YOU SAW RIGHT THERE, TOOK HOME GOLD FOR THE SECOND YEAR RIGHT THERE WATCHING THEM IN THE TUNNEL, YOUR JAW JUST DROPS, THEY DON'T CRASH INTO EACH OTHER, THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR COORDINATION, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. AS YOU SAW ME, NOT SO BEAUTIFUL. JILLIAN: WOULD YOU GO ACTUAL LIKE REAL SKY-DIVING AFTER YOU HAVE DONE THAT? I FEEL COMFORTABLE BECAUSE IF THE WIND WENT AHEY I'M NOT FALLING THAT FAR. YOU GUYS WENT TO REAL SKY-DIVING, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO THAT. THIS IS AMAZING TRAINING TOOL. ROB: I LOVE THAT. WAY MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU THINK. I WAS TELLING YOU WHEN WE ARE OFF AIR, IT'S ALL ABOUT BODY STRENGTH, CORE, IT WAS COOL.
