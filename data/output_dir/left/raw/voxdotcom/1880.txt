1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,400
Ever since they won control 
of the government in 2016.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,160
Republicans have been obsessed with getting
this one thing done.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,140
Tax reform.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,240
We're going to have a phenomenal tax reform.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,500
They've passed a bill, 
the President has signed it,

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,060
so let's break down what's actually going to change.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,180
Imagine that instead of getting paid in dollars,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,700
you got paid in cereal.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,400
The government takes a certain amount of cereal in taxes.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,140
And it uses it to pay other people to do things

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,119
build roads, fly fighter jets, do research.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,140
You get the picture.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,860
The more you earn, the bigger the share of your cereal

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,060
the government takes.

15
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,380
Sometimes the government wants to incentivize you

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,300
to do certain things with your cereal.

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,780
Like if you buy a house for a hundred pieces of cereal,

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,480
and then sell it for 200 pieces of cereal,

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,920
you'd normally have to pay 
capital gains taxes on that profit.

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,920
But there's a special loophole 
that says you don't have to.

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,600
The tax code is full of loopholes like this, which means

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,960
if everyone puts their cereal together,

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,520
there would be two bowls.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
One that the government dips into for taxes,

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,460
and one it doesn't.

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,440
Now, Republicans want the government to take

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,980
a smaller portion.

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,480
And they say they want people to keep

29
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,900
more of the cereal.

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,940
But if they do that, the government won't have

31
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,660
enough cereal to pay for what it needs.

32
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,760
So part of this new law is taking some of the cereal

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,340
that's not taxed, and change the rules

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,180
so that it is taxable.

35
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,640
That way, the government can take 
a smaller share of the cereal

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,700
but still pay for the stuff it needs.

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,880
This is what politicians mean when they talk about

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,780
'broadening the tax base.'

39
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,180
Here's the problem:

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,040
Republicans aren't broadening the base enough.

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,500
They're taking a lot less cereal from people

42
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,800
and adding some new taxable cereal

43
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,060
but not enough to pay for what the government needs.

44
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,520
To pay for that stuff, the government

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,240
is going to have to go into debt.

46
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,940
This means they're going to have to take

47
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,760
even more cereal, years in the future

48
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,020
to pay back the debt they're taking out now.

49
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,260
Republicans think this will help 
grow the total amount of cereal

50
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,360
available to both tax payers and the government.

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,780
So what happens to that 1.5 trillion dollar gap?

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,000
It goes back into people's bowls

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,900
but not everyone gets the same share.

54
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,700
If you break the population into five equally sized groups

55
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,460
based on how much they earned in 2017

56
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,460
and look at how much each group will earn in 2018

57
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,540
every group does get a tax cut.

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,180
But fast forward ten years

59
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,040
and you can see that lower and middle class Americans

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,920
will actually pay more since 
their tax cuts aren't permanent.

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,020
And if you break that top group into smaller groups

62
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,440
you can see the very wealthiest benefit most of all.

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,340
So while this new law does close some loopholes

64
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,160
to bring in new tax revenue

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,240
The bill's larger purpose is to realize the Republican

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,220
vision of a fairer tax code.

67
00:02:45,220 --> 00:00:00,000
One in which the wealthiest pay a lot less.
