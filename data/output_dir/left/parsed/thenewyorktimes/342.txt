In 2017, the U.S. saw
some of the strongest
and most expensive
storms in history.
And climate experts say
that as global temperatures
continue to rise,
things will only get worse,
and more costly.
“If you increase the ocean temperatures,
you will increase how strong
hurricanes can become.
That’s unequivocal.”
And as these storms strengthen,
the astronomical costs
associated with
them will rise, too.
How much are we talking here?
The superstorms and
wildfires of 2017
cost the U.S. a 
record-breaking $306 billion.
To put that into perspective,
that's more than triple the amount 
that the federal government
spends on education in a year.
This warmer climate also enables
fires to burn larger areas.
In 2017 the U.S. Forest Service
spent over 50 percent of its budget
putting out fires, and it can no
longer keep up with the costs.
So we’re already paying
big for climate change.
But as these storms help sink
the U.S. further into debt,
the Trump administration
is dismantling policy
and reducing
funding that’s aimed
at mitigating these problems.
“Since my very first
day in office,
I have been moving
at record pace
to cancel these regulations
and to eliminate
the barriers to domestic energy
production like never before.”
The Trump administration
has sought
to reverse at least 60
environmental rules
that it sees as overly
burdensome
to the fossil fuel industry.
“Politicians almost at any level,
it seems, struggle with the concept
that yes, you have
this big expense now,
for mitigation, but it’s 
actually less costly than
the expense of recovery.”
Let’s look back at the three
major hurricanes of last season,
each of which showcased
a different aspect of how
global warming can fuel these
destructive and costly storms.
In Rockport, Tex.,
Hurricane Harvey made
landfall as a Category 4 storm
with winds of up to
130 miles per hour.
It tore half this house
and many others to shreds.
“This was our
bedroom that we used.
Yeah, it just kind of
ripped everything off.”
“We’re not sure if we’re going
to have enough to rebuild.
So it all depends.”
Hurricane Harvey caused 
$125 billion in damages,
making it one of the 
costliest hurricanes ever.
A lot of that cost
is due to flooding,
which devastated Houston.
There’s never been this much
water released from one
storm system ever in the U.S.
And global warming is partly to blame.
“Warming temperatures allows
the air to hold more water.
And so we do 
expect rain rates
to increase under global warming.”
Flooding costs can be overwhelming.
According to FEMA, 
just one inch of flooding
in a home would cost a
household over $50,000.
At over 20 inches of flooding,
like in this home,
the costs can soar
up to $150,000.
“I've never seen anything like this.”
The National Flood Insurance Program,
virtually the only source of flood
insurance for millions of Americans,
can’t afford to help pay for 
these mega-floods anymore.
It’s been in debt since
Hurricane Katrina flooded
New Orleans back in 2005.
And just two days
before Harvey hit Texas,
President Trump
signed an executive order
to revoke an Obama-era
rule that required
new federal infrastructure
projects to be
built to higher flood standards.
Environmentalists say the rule
protected taxpayer money
from going to projects
that are threatened by flooding.
In Florida, Hurricane Irma
ravaged the state
and became the longest-lasting
powerful hurricane ever recorded.
“What was unprecedented
about Irma was
that it reached about
185 miles per hour
and it stayed there for
about a day and a half.”
And despite the fact that the 
strongest winds missed Florida,
it still had ample time to 
damage vast swaths of land,
much of it agricultural.
Preliminary losses to 
agriculture are at $2.5 billion.
“Hi. We lost everything.”
“There’s a price to pay
no matter where you live.
I choose hurricanes over 
anything else because
you have weeks to
prepare for them.
But as you can see,
you can prepare and prepare
and it's not never enough.”
Preparations for hurricanes
can only go so far
as sea levels continue to rise.
Over the last two decades,
the oceans around
South Florida’s coast
have risen an inch
every five years.
“Let’s say we had these latest
hurricanes 80 years ago.
Sea levels were lower.
The exact same storm surge
that would've occurred
would not have been
as severe."
In Puerto Rico,
Hurricane Maria went from
a Category 1 hurricane
to a Category 5
in less than a day,
allowing for almost
no time to prepare.
And that lack of
preparation,
slow government response and 
the island’s poor infrastructure
meant people were stuck
underwater for days
and in the dark for months.
The damages in Puerto Rico
alone add up to $90 billion.
“These are huge numbers we're talking about.
And I don’t think taxpayers
have any idea how much money
they're already paying for climate change.”
