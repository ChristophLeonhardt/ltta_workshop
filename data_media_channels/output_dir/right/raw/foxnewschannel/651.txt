00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,941
PERSONIFICATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS

00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:25,543
LEFT THINKING THEY KNOW BETTER

14
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:29,113

15
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:32,183
COMPOSITE OF POMPOUS ARROGANCE,

16
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:33,618

SMUG, CONDESCENDING.

19
00:00:36,422 --> 00:00:39,824
DEFIANT AND UNAPOLOGETIC.

20
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:45,229
STRZOK SEEMS TO SHARE CARDINAL

00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,168
SELFLESS SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE

THOUGH HE SEEMS TO HOLD ALL IN

24
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:53,671
CONTEMPT.

25
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,673
STRZOK IS ALSO A PERSONIFICATION

26
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:59,343

30
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,316
BUT INSTEAD DECIDE THEY KNOW

31
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:05,783
BETTER.

32
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:07,952
THEY KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT, AND THEN

33
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:09,153
THEY IMPLEMENT IT.

34
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:11,656
BUT STRZOK ISN'T BIASED.

35
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:12,890
HE SAID SO HIMSELF.

36
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:15,226

HIS PRESIDENCY WOULD BE.

INTERVIEWED.

64
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:36,674
>> THE COUNSEL OF THE FBI BASED

65
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:39,544
ON THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S

COUNSEL FOR THE FBI.

73
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,795
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

74
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:58,696
WHY WOULD IT BE IMPORTANT TO

75
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:03,768
WHY?

76
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,536
BECAUSE NOTHING HAPPENED TO EVEN

77
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:06,571
BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.

78
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,673
THEY MADE UP A DATE, AND THEY

79
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:11,576
MADE UP A REASON.

80
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:13,878
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS KNEW THE

81
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,981
DANGER ZONE THEY WERE IN, AND

82
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,589
SO AND

83
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:24,622

INSTRUCTED BY THE FBI NOT TO

00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:35,967
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

89
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,335
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, IS IT NOT

90
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:39,136
APPROPRIATE TO ALSO INTERJECT

91
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,543

HARASSMENT OF THE WITNESS.

97
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,380
BUT MORE THAN THAT, IT WAS A

98
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:23,948
MICROCOSM OF WHAT THE LEFT HAS

99
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:25,383
DONE WHEN THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN

100
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:26,484
THE RIGHT.

101
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,353
THE PENT-UP RAGE AND PANDEMONIUM

102
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,555
IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW ANGRY THE

103
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:32,890
LEFT IS.

104
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,126
WHILE THE REPUBLICAN DEDUCTED

112
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,779
THEY TOLD HIM NOT TO SAY

RUSSIA.

119
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,561

00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:34,185
THAT ANSWER.

129
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,593
JUDGE JEANINE: THE TEXT, QUOTE,

130
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:46,731
I WANT TO BELIEVE THE PATH YOU

00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:48,599
THREW OUT FOR CONSIDERATION IN

132
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,867
ANDY'S OFFICE THAT THERE IS NO

133
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:51,869
WAY HE GETS ELECTED.

134
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,172
BUT I AM AFRAID WE CAN'T TAKE

135
00:05:55,173 --> 00:05:57,942
THAT RISK IT'S LIKE THE

136
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,677
INSURANCE POLICY IN THE UNLIKELY

137
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:02,346
EVENT YOU DIE BEFORE YOU ARE 40.

138
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:04,248
STRZOK WASN'T TRYING TO PREVENT

139
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:05,282
TRUMP FROM WINNING.

140
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,851
WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS EVEN

141
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:07,518
WORSE.

142
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,854
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HAVING A

143
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:12,289
PLAN TO EFFECTIVELY

144
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,625
DISENFRANCHISE THE VOTERS WHO

145
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,160
ELECTED TRUMP.

146
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:18,362
SHOULD TRUMP WIN.

147
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,398
FORGET DEMOCRACY, FORGET THE

148
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,338
HE SAID SO HIMSELF.

149
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,408
IN A TEXTING TO HIS MISTRESS.

150
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:32,576
IF THIS CANDIDATE OF CHOICE

151
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:33,244
DIDN'T WIN.

152
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:36,313
THE ONE HE HELPED AVOID CRIMINAL

153
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:36,881
LIABILITY.

154
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:39,517
HE WAS GOING TO ABUSE THE TOUR

155
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:42,386
WE ENTRUSTED HIM TO INSURE THAT

156
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:44,288
IT DIDN'T MATTER.

157
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,792
IF THE UNTHINKABLE WERE TO

158
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:49,994
HAPPEN, HIS INSURANCE POLICY

159
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:59,136
IS THE RUSSIA COLLUSION

160
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,976
LIARS, LEAKS AND LIBERALS.

161
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,978
DETAILING THE POWER STRUCTURE,
