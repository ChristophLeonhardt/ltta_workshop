CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR HUGH
HEWITT HAS CHIMED IN ON THE
SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE IN
SANTA FE TEXAS AND HE HAS AN
INTERESTING STRATEGY FOR
PREVENTING A SHOOTING LIKE
THIS FROM HAPPENING IN
THE FUTURE.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> THE TRENCHCOATS KIND OF A
GIVEAWAY, YOU JUST SAY NO MORE
TRENCHCOATS.
CREEPY PEOPLE, MAKE A LIST,
CHECK IT TWICE.
>>CREEPY IS INTERESTING TO USE
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE PHOTO AND
THAT GRAPHIC.
>> ONTO THE TRENCHANT
OBSERVATION HE MADE.
TO BE FAIR
THERE HAS NOW BEEN TO SCHOOL
SHOOTINGS WHERE THEY WERE
TRENCHCOATS, COLUMBINE, AND THIS
LATEST ONE IN TEXAS.
IN ALL THE OTHER ONES, AND THOSE
AS WELL, THE CONNECTING FACTOR
WAS NOT TRENCHCOATS, IT
WAS THE GUNS.
AND ALL THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS
THEY WERE GUNS.
TO OUT OF THE NOW HUNDREDS
THERE WERE TRENCHCOATS.
WHO WOULD MAKE THAT POINT UNLESS
THE PURPOSE WAS TO DECEIVE.
HUGH HEWITT, FOR ALL OF HIS
DOWNSIDES IS NOT A DUMB GUY
THAT HE IS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO
KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING.
HE KNOWS THERE WERE TRENCHCOATS
IN TWO OF THE SHOOTINGS THERE
WERE GUNS IN ALL OF THE
SHOOTINGS.
HE SAYS THAT POINT BECAUSE HE
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON THE
GUNS, THAT IS WHAT PAYS FOR
ALL THE RIGHT-WING.
THE TRENCHCOAT INDUSTRY DIDN'T
BRIBE ANY OF THE GUYS ON THE
RIGHT-WING, AND THEY ARE NOT
DOING THE PROPAGANDA.
THEY CAN ATTACK VIDEO GAMES
AND TRENCHCOATS.
HUGH HEWITT HAS TO BE BRIGHT
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THAT IS A
PREPOSTEROUS POINT, BUT HE MAKES
IT ANYWAY JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU DON'T TOUCH THEIR BELOVED
GUNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY
DOING KILLINGS.
DID THIS PARTICULAR SHOOTER'S
MOTHER ANYONE WITH HIS
TRENCHCOAT?
OH NO, IT WAS THE
GUNS THAT KILLED THE PEOPLE.
>>I'M JUST WONDERING IF THEY ARE
EXCEPTIONS FOR THE TRENCHCOAT
RULE?
ARE THERE SPECIFIC COLORS
THAT ARE OKAY?
LET'S SAY IT'S A
RAINY DAY AND A FEMALE STUDENT
WANTS TO SHOW UP IN A LAVENDER
COLORED TRENCHCOAT.
IS THAT ACCEPTABLE?
DO WE GO SO
FAR AS TO BAN BAGGY HOODIES
BECAUSE HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HIDE
A GUN IN A BAGGIE HOODIE?
IT ALL
COMES DOWN TO US BEING
INCONVENIENCED AND LIVING IN AN
EVER SO RAPID POLICE STATES
WHERE ALL OF OUR PRIVACY IS
BEING VIOLATED, ALL OF OUR
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS BEING
MONITORED, WE HAVE TO DRESS A
CERTAIN WAY, WALKING TO SCHOOL A
CERTAIN WAY, DEAL WITH METAL
DETECTORS OR COPS PATTING US
DOWN.
WHEN DO WE GET TO LIVE IN A FREE
SOCIETY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
REALLY FREE IN AMERICA IF WE
CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE
INCONVENIENCED.
>> THE LAST PIECE OF THE
SUPERB LOGIC.
THE CLOTHING THAT YOU CAN HIDE
THE GUNS AND IS A PROBLEM.
THE GUN YOU ARE HIDING IS
NOT A PROBLEM.
THE GUN THAT YOU TAKE OUT AND
SHOOT PEOPLE WITH IS NOT THE
PROBLEM, THE CLOTHING THAT YOU
HAD THAT NONDANGEROUS WEAPON
IN IS THE PROBLEM.
HUGH HEWITT, BRILLIANT LOGIC,
WE APPRECIATE IT.
