we're gonna talk about just how severely the deck is stacked against victims of sexual abuse if their abusers happen to be members of Congress now we've all seen this disturbing and quite frankly really creepy story but eighty eight-year-old Michigan Democrat John Conyers and his years of sexually abusing women did cost Conyers his post as the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee but this is a really pervasive problem and I'm not gonna get into the players we know what John Conyers did we know what Al Franken did we know the Franken is going back to work claiming to be quote embarrassed and a shame that from the New York Times but let's talk about the system in place and how this system proactively and very aggressively works against the victims I've mentioned here on the show that I worked sex crimes cases both in law enforcement and afterwards in the private sector as a partner of groups like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children I worked with the NYPD the LAPD the US Marshal Service via Nick Mack that's the acronym for the National Center and I learned quite a bit about sex crimes investigations both crimes against children crimes against adults prosecutorial and investigative processes are very very similar and when I read the way victims are treated when their abusers are members of the House or the Senate well made my blood boil because the deck is stacked against them the deck is severely stacked against them and the Congress people the swamp dwellers swamp dwellers are rallying around their own they're circling the wagons and protecting these sexual abusers this is terrible terrible stuff now luckily there's some movement on this sunlight is the best disinfectant right so there's big light shown on this now and a couple of lawmakers led by representative Jackie Speier a Democrat at a California and representative Barbara Comstock a Republican out of Virginia now representative Comstock's name is important I want you to remember that because she sits on the house Administration Committee which is responsible on the House of Representative side for paying out these settlements I'm gonna get into the settlements the numbers and the real numbers just a few moments they're pushing for legislation again from new york times that would quote require claims to be handled in public in the senate senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York a Democrat is pushing similar legislation so this is good bipartisan legislation this stuff should not be handled in the shadows it certainly shouldn't now one of the major questions is whether the spire Comstock legislation is going to apply retroactively Lee in other words are we going to learn about all the past settlements all of the past members of the House and Senate who have been accused of sexual misconduct or is it only going to be there's only gonna be exposed going forward I believe it has to be retroactive your taxpayer dollars were spent you have a right to know where they went and you especially a right to know where they went if they went to settle claims of misconduct from people who would then clearly be unfit to hold office this is relevant information going into the 2018 midterms might be the most relevant information going into the 2018 midterms it also goes on to say so Rob Portman from Ohio said he would port retroactive releases but others including Representative Nancy Pelosi the House Democratic leader were more more cautious saying that unmasking what is that word unmasking lawmakers could reveal the identity of victims who want to remain private that is bunk that is absolute nonsense law enforcement daily posts the photos of rapists the photos of pedophiles on the registered sex on the sex offender registry without identifying the victims the Nancy Pelosi is clearly trying to cover her own because Al Franken a Democrat and John Conyers a Democrat are right now the two most prominent sexual abusers in Congress that's all Nancy Pelosi is doing now another guy representative Jamie Raskin remember his name he also sits on the House Administration Committee which pays out these settlements on the House of Reps ID well Jamie Raskin a Maryland Democrat who holds the recently created position of vice ranking member on the Judiciary Committee so he was an ally of John Conyers praised mr. Conyers for making a wise decision now in fairness to Raskin he went on and said quote the house is ready to clean house with respect to sexual harassment and everybody agrees that we need to have a zero-tolerance policy or do they or do they because Nancy Pelosi the ranking Democrat in the house former Speaker of the House refuses to call for John Conyers resignation in fact she called John Conyers quote an icon in our country and said quote he has done a great deal to protect women Nancy Pelosi is now a parody of herself she even realized how ridiculously embarrassing she sounds how she's making a fool of herself a New York representative Kathleen rice a Democrat called for Conyers resignation so kudos to representative rice she's putting the safety of women before party unlike Nancy Pelosi representative Gregory Meeks of Queens said that Conyers should have given up his perch as the Judiciary Committee's ranking member a day before he did it so you know kudos again kudos to these Democrats but Nancy Pelosi I mean the woman becomes more disgraceful by the day and remember Nancy Pelosi said that Conyers is an icon in our country and he's done a great deal to protect women well Cokie Roberts NPR's Cokie Roberts was with ABC for a long time who is no friend of conservatives said that the female press corps the women in the press corps congressional press corps covered up congressional sexual misconduct for years Cokie Roberts said quote I mean we all talked about it for years don't get in the elevator with him you know and the whole every female in the press corps knew that right don't get in the elevator with him seems to be referring to Conyers she was on ABC's this week and they were talking about Conyers and she said that in the context of a discussion about Conyers I think about that every woman in the congressional press corps knew not to get in an elevator with John Conyers that you'd get groped but Nancy Pelosi and Jamie Raskin Democrats are claiming they know nothing about this they know nothing they know nothing that went on and now it's about zero tolerance I mean do these people think we're idiots we know the answer they do Congress has become rulers they become rulers when they're supposed to be representatives they're supposed to represent to us not reign over us they've really lost sight of that that's what we need to vote all of these establishment people out now political did a really good piece decoding it's actually called Congress has sexual harassment system decoded so the conventional number that you keep hearing is seventeen million dollars in public money paid since 1997 to set a workplace disputes on Capitol Hill not all of that money has gone to the sexual misconduct allegations not all of it has and and there really isn't a tally on just how much has but it wouldn't matter anyway and here's why because in Conyers case he did pay a settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct she worked for him but quote the money came out of Conyers office budget meaning it wasn't even included in that seventeen million dollar total so how many more members have quietly settled these cases now what's even worse is that the like I told you the Committee on house administration is the one that approves and pays these settlements now this is an important little paragraph here I want to read it to you Politico asks a question question is who knows when a lawmaker or aide settles a harassment claim the answer is both the identities of lawmakers or their age raids who reach misconduct settlements aren't disclosed effectively meaning there's no warning system for other potential victims now this is exactly what the spire Comstock bill is trying to eradicate it's trying to prevent but let's dig into how bad that is let's think about this for a second in the real world if you face civil claims and then subsequently criminal claims or criminal first then civil and you lose in the criminal case you're a registered sex offender your name is on a thousand websites your pictures on a thousand websites and your nerd neighbors your neighbors get alerts on their cell phone when you move into the neighborhood the whole world gets to know you're coming because of your sexual abuse toward an innocent but not if you're a member of Congress if you're a member of Congress your to quietly settle this this claim you're allowed to do it before criminal charges come and your victim is given a very rigid non-disclosure agreement everything is done in secrecy and the most important sentence there was there's no war no partial sentence quote there's no warning system for other potential victims that is exactly why we created sex offender registries so that people would know if the violent rapist lives down the street at the pedophile lives next door but not in Congress in Congress the policy is to cover-up for these people and it's done at the committee level we do not live in a system where everyone is equal people elected to office people appointed to office or given special treatment we saw it with Hillary Clinton and we're seeing it again with members of Congress many of whom should probably have been criminally prosecuted for their sexual abuse this really really gets me fired up now who's on this committee well the ranking members of the House Administration Committee decide if the settlements are paid or not and their names are Gregg Harper a Republican from Mississippi and Robert Brady a Democrat from Pennsylvania Harper's in Mississippi's third congressional district Brady and Pennsylvania's first but Barbara Comstock and Jamie Raskin are also on that committee Barbra Comstock a Republican from Virginia's 10th congressional district is sponsoring the bill with Jackie Speier like I told you earlier to bring this in a light game you're asked in the Maryland Democrat says he wants zero tolerance but it sure doesn't seem like he's pushing legislation for it so this is this is a serious serious problem and your money is being spent to cover this up now the couple of more quotes here from Politico they say well we discuss 3d who in Congress approved settlements paid with taxpayer money now we talked about this at the house Administration Committee I just read you who the members are there's no such now this important is that's only on the house side well there is no such similar process in the Senate according to gene Manning who set up the upper chambers chief counsel for employment office in 1993 and remain in that post until 2014 from the same political piece she said quote I don't understand why they do that meaning the house Administration Committee having a panel that approves the settlements he said quote she would be concerned that it become it could become political each side of the aisle could have a political reason for not approving a settlement if a case isn't settled it could proceed to a public lawsuit and think about what she's saying this was a lawyer for the Senate who's far less concerned about victims then she is about having one person paid by the United States Senate whose job it is to approve settlements to cover up the sexual misconduct of senators you see when we used a team the term deep state it's not conspiratorial it's not a group of old white men around a table smoking cigars in a dimly lit star chamber room you know planning things in the world as part of a sub government no it's nothing that nefarious or conspiratorial it's a lawyer who held the job for 19 no what was it 1993 to 2014 she held that job for 21 years hell that job for 21 years in her main mission was to cover up scandals for Congress people she was their lawyer and she wants that to be the policy that the lawyer paid for by the Senators is the one determining whether or not the allegation should go public and other victims should be warned they think that cover-ups are just business as usual just let him happen now to more people who are completely useless in all this and I will actually for people right are Nancy Pelosi who we spoke about be ranking damn on the house side Chuck Schumer the ranking demin the Senate side Mitch McConnell the useless Senate Majority Leader and Paul Ryan the absolutely useless Republican Speaker of the House we're going to end this by me telling you just how restrictive we're just how restrictive the non-disclosures are for the victims from the same political piece the compliance office says now once the House Administration Committee approves a settlement compliance office pays it that quote there is no restriction on whom you can tell about pursuing a harassment claim but victims are subjected to confidentiality requirements during their mandatory counseling and mediation periods an aide who might want to speak out about their harassment claim including talking to their employer can ask to waive confidentiality during counseling but it doesn't necessarily have to be approved a mediation process however remains subject to strict secrecy rules including the use of non-disclosure agreements that bind victims from talking the trappings of confidentiality they permeate the process Alexus ronica an attorney was represented to cleave victims and she says something that I think is absolutely spot-on she says quote the law is written to create a system it disincentivize staffers from coming forward in other words your allegations if you're sexually abused by a member of Congress these elite rulers its ruling class you're of sexually abused by one of them if you're victimized the system is set up to essentially silence you protect them let them go on doing this in the shadows and you can never speak about it or warn anybody that isn't a broken system that is a system that never should have been that is a system those foundations were cracked from day one and that is a system that needs to be burned to the ground
