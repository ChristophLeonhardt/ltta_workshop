the Ebola virus strikes again more deaths in Democratic Republic of Congo and concerns the disease could spread to other countries millions of people could be at risk so how can a bola be contained this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Elizabeth puranam it is the ninth Ebola outbreak and Democratic Republic of Congo and for decades dozens of people have died in the past two weeks an experimental vaccine campaign began on Monday in a bid to contain the virus but it's already spread to unban Dhaka City a major transport hub on the river Congo and there are fears that could reach the capital Kinshasa before crossing the border nine countries have been put on alert Victoria Gaytan be reports medical staff from the charity Doctors Without Borders are taking no chances they're caring for a patient suffering from the Ebola virus so full protective suits are mandatory in another area of the hospital medics are checking people for signs of Ebola as they arrive for work to help battle the latest outbreak there's no known cure for Ebola which causes organ failure sufferers often bleed to death we have to keep protecting ourselves every person coming in and out has to wash their hands as a measure of protection every person who goes into the treatment center must have protective clothing and also as we know vaccinations are essential in protecting ourselves the latest outbreak was first reported two weeks ago in the northwestern town of Picaro it's since spread 150 kilometers to the regional capital in Bonn Dhaka home to more than a million Congolese the city's a major transport hub on the Congo River and there are concerns the virus could spread quickly we did a hundred communication well the vaccine vaccination program may suffer so we are also in the next two weeks or so assessing how to deploy and typologies the World Health Organization is using an experimental vaccine to try to contain the disease as well as a publicity campaign encouraging everyone to wash their hands and limit physical contact we have to wave and not touch people for saying hello we should not shake hands and we should not stand close to people we also have to wash our hands before we enter the classroom and before eating the last Ebola outbreak four years ago killed at least eleven thousand people in several countries in West Africa this time doctors in the DRC are better prepared to contain the virus Victoria Gaytan B al-jazeera well Ebola actually got his name in Democratic Republic of Congo from the Ebola River near where the virus first appeared in almost four decades later a major outbreak swept through West Africa killing at least 11,000 people it began in Guinea when a two year old boy and members of his family died of acute viral infections and fever the virus spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone it's believed funeral burial practices helped fuel the outbreak at one hospital hundreds of patients and health workers died when a bola reached the Nigerian capital Lagos home to 21 million people the World Health Organization declared an international emergency it was almost two years before Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone were all given the all-clear in 2016 but new outbreaks have been reported recently let's talk to our guests now joining us in Newcastle is stereos mas Hoss a molecular biologist and a geneticist at Northumbria University and via Skype from trondheim in Norway how can Balkan a researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology welcome to the program mr. Moss Haas why is Ebola back and this time and Democratic Republic of Congo hi good afternoon Paul I never went away to be perfectly honest with you was originally discovered in this region back in the 70s it lives naturally in the wild animals found in the jungles of Africa and ever so often we see the virus jumping from the animals into the human population and it's something that has happened in the past and it's very likely to continue happening in the future mr. Balkan who is most at risk of getting the virus most at-risk getting the virus in the particular outbreak in in Congo now is those people who live in the surroundings of other people who are being infected and and this is family members neighbors those who share the same also people who have already been infected mr. Moss house there is now a new vaccine you know which was first used towards the end of the Ebola outbreak in 2016 the World Health Organization has called a vaccine a paradigm shift in fighting the virus what do we know about it and how it will work so this vaccine was developed years in advance however it was tested for the first time in West Africa the big advantage about it is that it is a single dose you don't need to get the people who are vaccinated once to come back and get a second dose like we see with many other vaccines the reality is that we have done what's known as a ring vaccination approach which is basically going around the population to find the people that have been in contact with individuals that were confirmed as Ebola victims people that were infected not necessarily just people that died from Ebola virus and vaccinated these individuals in addition to family members and neighbors as mentioned earlier this includes all the health care workers and all the people working at burial sites for example who look after the infected patients but also who carry out their final rites for the deceased so the vaccine is very likely to work based on the data we have so far and it is a tremendous action that we have managed within a month of discovering this outbreak to have the vaccine already in people in the affected region and mr. Balkan how difficult has it been and will it be to get this vaccine you know to some of the most remote parts of the DRC all the while keeping it in temperatures I think between under 60 - 60 and minus 80 degrees it's a considerable challenge logistical exercise to be able to disburse the vaccines under under the challenging conditions in in DRC that's one thing and the other thing is that this vaccine campaign is still research trial meaning that it's only voluntary to receive the vaccine and they need to obtain the consent from everyone they want to exceed we know there is many beliefs around the reasons or contracting Ebola and we don't have fully control over this in the population at least in the most rural areas who are mostly illiterate and yes once the vaccines do arrive in the region through much difficulty how do you deal with people that have superstitions around the disease who might believe that it's a curse and would rather go to preachers or traditional healers than to medical clinics to get vaccines which they might be really unfamiliar with it's based on previous experiences from West Africa and also some other areas even in Congo you need to gain the trust of the people and you need to come out with a lot of information so which people to live in and you need to reach them you need to engage with the community leaders you need to use media television radio newspapers order channel channel faith-based systems to get the information across and what is positive here in in Congo is that they they are all maybe a bit more familiar with Ebola epidemic compared to for example in what we saw in West Africa two years ago yes as we mentioned I think this is the ninth time the DRC has had an Ebola outbreak just in the last four decade it's mr. Moss house I know that anthropologists are being deployed as part of the team so what role are they going to play in you know bridging the differences in people's understanding of Ebola and helping convince them to get vaccinated so the biggest challenge that was faced in West Africa was exactly what your other guest mentioned local beliefs superstitions us have been put forward but also some conspiracy theories even around what is being attempted and what is going to be achieved by the vaccination programs the anthropologists role is to go in understand what those beliefs are understand how the networks of communication leadership and opinion leading actually work within the region and then using local terms local language local experts local customs even if possible try to influence the way these people behave to a reduce the transmission and be also make vaccinations acceptable we saw for example in West Africa that the burial rites the anointing of the family with the waters with which the deceased had been washed before being interred was one of the primary routes of transmission this has now completely been eliminated almost from the community and this is one of the main reasons why in West Africa we had a containment of the outbreak there will be differences and how things are done in the Congo but the fact that a there is local knowledge and local history of how to observe prevent the transmission and contain this disease will actually allow the influencing of the local communities to be perhaps much more effective and much more rapid than what we saw in West Africa mr. Balcombe we know that at least one death has been reported at the provincial capital and bandik aware some 1.2 million people live but given that the city you know sprawls along the Congo River just how much of a concern is that or how concern to health officials about the virus reaching villagers along the river making it to the capital Kinshasa you know with its population of 10 million and then possibly to neighboring countries well it's a considerable concern and when the virus infects people who live in more populated that areas and where people are moving far more it's definitely a concern and this is a race against time to be able to introduce the measures that are needed meaning contact tracing and identifying those who are sick or are potentially sick which is not a very easy task actually in an in an able outbreak because the symptoms are so vague in there in the early stages of the disease it mimics ordinary fluid mimics malaria it mimics a lot of them very very common diseases so people really don't know if they are our potential or being unable a patient or not not an easy task in this one that will of course cost them a lot of money as well this time at least health authorities seem to be tackling this early on unlike the last Ebola outbreak with a World Health Organisation was severely criticized for being too slow do we know how much this is all going to cost now and who's going to pay for it mr. Moss Hoss I don't think you can put a number yet to how much this is going to cost until it being contained simply because we don't know by which point in time it will be contained everybody hopes that over the next month two months we will see no more new cases no more new deaths and the outbreak will be over the very good news is that all the large countries globally have offered money the World Bank has offered money directly to support the people on the ground tracing those individuals that may have been exposed to infected people offering the vaccine getting all the necessary materials there so that treatment can take place and contain contain place and what we need to do is actually congratulate everybody that has contributed to ensuring that within a month that responses there on the ground already and as well as contribution money mr. Vulcan what else do countries and especially neighboring countries need to be doing now well it's personal to the financial aspects it's what we saw during the most African of make is that it's wise and it's a good investment to to spend a lot of money in the early stages because if there are the largest outbreak growth that more expensive it is to contain it and and the funds that are asked for now it's a considerable considerable amount of money however it's just less than one percent of the total cost of the West African outbreak what mr. Balcombe can I just jump can I ask how much money is being asked for now because I know it was something like around 3.6 billion that it costs to contain the last West African outbreak yes I heard that there's been a call for around between fifty and sixty u.s. million dollars however yeah that's that money I've heard later stays in the in the news which is which is just a fraction as you mention of the total cost of everything and mr. Moss has some the US government has announced I was going to touch we need to point out at this point yes please go on yes sorry to interrupt you but we need to point out at this point in time we're only a month into this outbreak the West African Ebola outbreak lasted two years so let's compare apples to apples the amount of money that's being put in at this point of time is appropriate and in the right level to ensure that we do not have a repetition of West Africa well you know the US government has announced that it's going to do eight eight million dollars to fighting this latest outbreak but the Trump administration I see is also planning to rescind some 250 million dollars that the Obama administration had put aside to fighting the disease I mean how detrimental is that going to be for efforts to contain the spread I think it's important in situations like this to look at what science has to offer to the betterment of humanity and understand how prevention is actually much more important than cure or containment so in that respect I will perhaps join the voices of others globally that urge the Trump administration to actually listen to its scientific advisors on these matters and take into account that we're not a isolated community anymore we are a global network of people of companies of governments of infrastructures that are reliant to on each other any kind of gap that is allowed to a business to grow as a threat will be a damaging to that business either in the short term in the long term and in businessman language I think what this is allowing is for a threat to become more substantial to us a number one less easily likes to put it and mr. Bolten if I can go back to you on the point of what other countries especially in the region can and should be doing in Nigeria and Kenya have set up health stations at land crossings ports airports to check temperatures of travelers whose trips began in the DRC do these help stop the spread of the disease I think it it definitely contributes to the to the containment of the spread of the disease and we saw in West Africa also that it reduced travel quite a bit domestic and well at least of domestic and so it that's important message here and mr. Morehouse what other lessons do you think have really been learned from the last Ebola outbreak and being applied now and you would like to see really applied now to contain this I think there's a lot to be said about working with the local communities engaging with the local people and actually conveying the information in a manner that actually relates to what these people are enduring are subjected to and they have to go through it's all well and good for people in the rivalry towers that come down and say you need to do X Y and Zed but it's actually the local communities that need to engage in this and that's why we solved the problem West Africa it was not entirely down to the West jumping in feet-first and trying to sort out the problem yes that that was highly impactful but we're seeing right now how the local effect is actually more powerful and more efficacious in actually achieving this so that is the first lesson the second lesson is don't wait till the last minute get in quick and prevent rather than cure mr. Balkan I know that we were spoken about the challenge is working with local communities and also as mr. Moss Hass was saying it's absolutely necessary to work with them and on their level that apart from some of the things were spoken about like being unfamiliar with vaccines and skeptical of them the challenges around that what are some of the other things that prohibit people from getting help especially if they're in very remote regions and need to pay for transport and might need to take time off work to get to medical clinics yes I think one of the other lessons we saw from West Africa at least from the early stages was that health care facilities hospitals and clinics actually became sites where Ebola increased its it spread and and its most locations where people get got infected and that's why they developed a public treatment centers and containment centers this led to very high exposure among local health care workers and many of them died of Ebola which I understood to be we see also from from the Congress now that there are verses among the confirmed dead so having having special focus on on local clinics local hospitals to to prevent them and I know they are among the first ones now also to receive the vaccine and they will be more likely to accept the vaccine because they have a background in the in the first place and by keeping those local health workers in post I think is considerable part of that has already been done mr. Morehouse I know this is looking quite far ahead but is it possible to get rid of Ebola for good so that we have managed to prevent the transmission of other diseases in the past and we have a large collection of vaccines to prevent people from becoming disease for things that exist in major if this vaccine proves as effective as we have seen so far during this outbreak I don't think it's inconceivable to then start talking about making this vaccine available to all the countries where the fruit bats that carry the virus can actually begin vaccinating all their citizens against this a deadly disease if we reach that kind of scenario than the chances of an another outbreak in the future can be contained but we need to see what happens in this outbreak and I need to point out that it's not just this particular version of Ebola that exists there are other versions of Ebola there are other viruses like the nipple virus we're seeing in India right now actually of equal danger that we need to be looking at and these viruses will appear in populations that perhaps don't have the night the correct levels of sanitation or use bushmeat as as a food as a source of protein so for example people will eat these fruit bats and that's how we'll they will get contaminated sometimes they will get infected so if we can get vaccines made for these viruses then we can potentially contain future outbreaks but we need to see what happens with this vaccine and this outbreak in the next few weeks and mr. Bolten how hopeful would you say you are about this vaccine and containing again this outbreak so that it won't result in the kind of huge numbers of deaths that we saw last time I'm quite optimistic I think we see a completely different attitude now in such an early phase on the old okay compared to what we have seen in the past and if that definitely seems like the West Africa North Way two years ago has been wakening up the international community and the efforts that are being put in place now is completely different from what it was in the early stages of the West African outbreak so I'm I'm optimistic that the Congolese authorities and the international community together will be able to contain this however we need to be vigilant and and and have an active approach mr. Balkan thank you very much for that and thank you to both of our guests from Newcastle stereos Moss Hoss and in Trondheim Norway Hakan Balkan and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com and for further discussion do go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com /aj inside story you can also join the conversation on Twitter I'll handle this at AJ inside the story from the Elizabeth puranam and the whole team here bye for now you
