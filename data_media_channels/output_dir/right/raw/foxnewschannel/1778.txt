00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,436
[APPLAUSE]

195
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:50,538
I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

196
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,706
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY WHO

197
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:53,808
REALLY HAS CREATED A NEW DAY

198
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:54,575
FOR ISRAEL AT THE U.N.

199
00:06:54,575 --> 00:07:04,652
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

200
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:06,287
ON DECEMBER 6th, PRESIDENT

201
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:08,890
TRUMP WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HIS

202
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,091
DECISION AND TODAY'S

203
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:12,793
CELEBRATION DO NOT REFLECT A

204
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:13,928
DEPARTURE FROM OUR STONG

205
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,162
COMMITMENT TO LASTING PEACE.

206
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,397
A PEACE THAT OVERCOMES THE

207
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,199
CONFLICTS OF THE PAST IN ORDER

208
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,501
TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN A BRIGHTER

209
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:21,969
AND MORE BOUNDLESS FUTURE.

210
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:23,804
AS WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE

211
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:26,707
PROTESTS OF THE LAST MONTH AND

212
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:27,408
EVEN TODAY, THOSE PROVOKING

213
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:29,043
VIOLENCE ARE PART OF THE

214
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:30,611
PROBLEM AND NOT PART OF THE

215
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:30,978
SOLUTION.

216
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:37,184
[APPLAUSE]

217
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:38,686
UNITED STATES IS PREPARED TO

218
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,321
SUPPORT A PEACE AGREEMENT IN

219
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:41,956
EVERY WAY THAT WE CAN.

220
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:44,292
WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE

221
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,960
FOR BOTH SIDES TO GAIN MORE

222
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,062
THAN THEY GIVE SO THAT ALL

223
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,631
PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN PEACE, SAFE

224
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:52,500
FROM DANGER, FREE FROM FEAR,

225
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,803
AND ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS.

226
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,372
THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES

227
00:07:58,372 --> 00:07:59,073
THE SENSITIVITY SURROUNDING

228
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:00,508
JERUSALEM, A CITY THAT MEANS SO

229
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,777
MUCH TO SO MANY.

230
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,745
JERUSALEM IS A CITY UNIQUE IN

231
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,314
THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION.

232
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:09,350
NO OTHER PLACE ON EARTH CAN

233
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,686
CLAIM SIGNIFICANCE TO THREE

234
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:12,620
MAJOR RELIGIONS, EACH DAY JEWS

235
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,022
PRAY AT THE WESTERN WALL.

236
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:17,124
MUSLIMS BOW IN PRAYER AT THE

237
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:18,459
MOSQUE AND CHRISTIANS WORSHIP

238
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,162
AT THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY

239
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:22,596
SEPULCHRE AND WHY PRESIDENT

240
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:23,764
TRUMP HAS CALLED MANY TIMES,

241
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,399
INCLUDING RIGHT NOW, ON ALL

242
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,704
PARTIES TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS

243
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:32,273
QUO AT JERUSALEM'S HOLY SITES.

244
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:33,908
WHILE THE CHALLENGES TO PEACE

245
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:35,308
ARE NUMEROUS I HAVE PERSONALLY

246
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:36,744
SEEN THAT THE DETERMINATION OF

247
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:40,047
THE LEADERS IN THE REGION AND

248
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:41,582
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD REMAINS

249
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:41,948
STEADFAST.

250
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:44,752
THEY HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH PAIN,

251
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:45,686
SORROW, AND WASTED OPPORTUNITY

252
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:49,357
AND THEY THINK IT'S TIME TO TRY

253
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:49,991
SOMETHING BETTER.

254
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:50,791
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, JERUSALEM

255
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,328
HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF WAR AND

256
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:54,695
CONQUEST.

257
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,697
USED TO DIVIDE PEOPLE AND

258
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:57,865
INSTIGATE CONFLICT BY THOSE

259
00:08:57,865 --> 00:08:58,799
WITH EVIL INTENTIONS BUT IT

260
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,602
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

261
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,471
JERUSALEM MUST REMAIN A CITY

262
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:05,840
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE OF ALL

263
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,774
FAITHS TOGETHER.

264
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:08,409
TO VISIT, TO WORSHIP, TO

265
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,311
RESPECT EACH OTHER, AND TO

266
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:11,245
APPRECIATE THE MAJESTY OF

267
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,115
HISTORY AND THE GLORY OF GOD'S

268
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:14,548
CREATION.

269
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,751
ISRAEL HAS BEEN A RESPONSIBLE

270
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:19,020
CUSTODIAN OF JERUSALEM AND HAS

271
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,421
KEPT THESE RELIGIOUS SITES OPEN

272
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,122
TO ALL.

273
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,990
IN FACT, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE

274
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,527
1967 WAR, ONE OF THE FIRST ACTS

275
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,863
WAS TO ADOPT THE PROTECTION OF

276
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:30,398
HOLY PLACES LAW ENSURING ACCESS

277
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:33,834
TO PLACES OF WORSHIP TO MEMBERS

278
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,103
OF ALL RELIGIONS.

279
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:37,338
FUNDS WERE IMMEDIATELY

280
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,006
ALLOCATED TO REPAIR ANY DAMAGE

281
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:40,875
TO THE CHURCHES, MOSQUES AND

282
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,009
SYNAGOGUES THAT SUFFERED

283
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:44,845
THROUGH WAR, CONFLICT AND

284
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:45,179
NEGLECT.

285
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:46,514
AS ISRAEL TURNS 70 THE SEARCH

286
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:47,882
FOR A LASTING PEACE TURNS OVER

287
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:49,083
A NEW LEAF.

288
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,419
ONE OF REALISM AND OF NOT BEING

289
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:52,586
AFRAID TO STAND STRONGLY WITH

290
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:54,221
OUR ALLIES FOR WHAT IS GOOD,

291
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:58,392
FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, AND FOR WHAT

292
00:09:58,392 --> 00:09:58,759
IS TRUE.

293
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,093
WHEN --

294
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:02,797
[APPLAUSE]

295
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:03,264
THANK YOU.

296
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:05,599
WHEN THERE IS PEACE IN THIS

297
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,135
REGION, WE WILL LOOK BACK UPON

298
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:10,471
THIS DAY AND REMEMBER THAT THE

299
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:14,008
JOURNEY TO PEACE STARTED WITH A

300
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:14,975
STRONG AMERICA, RECOGNIZING THE

301
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:15,276
TRUTH.

302
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:25,119
[APPLAUSE]

303
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:28,756
THE PURSUIT OF PEACE IS THE

304
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:30,391
MOST NOBLE PURSUIT OF HUMANKIND.

305
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,126
I BELIEVE PEACE IS WITHIN REACH

306
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:33,894
IF WE DARE TO BELIEVE THAT THE

307
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,529
FUTURE CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM

308
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:38,132
THE PAST, THAT WE ARE NOT

309
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:39,300
CONDEMNED TO RELIVE HISTORY,

310
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,635
AND THAT THE WAY THINGS WERE IS

311
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,804
NOT HOW THEY MUST FOREVER BE.

312
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:45,906
IT WILL NOT BE AN EASY ROAD AND

313
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:48,242
IT WILL BE FILLED WITH

314
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:49,677
DIFFICULT MOMENTS AND TOUGH

315
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,545
DECISIONS, BUT IF WE DREAM BIG,

316
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:56,250
IF WE LEAD WITH COURAGE, WE CAN

317
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,418
CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FOR

318
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:59,386
MILLIONS FROM HOPELESS TO

319
00:10:59,386 --> 00:10:59,753
BOUNDLESS.

320
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,957
[APPLAUSE]

321
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:05,993
THIS IS A HOPE THAT MANY OF US

322
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:06,694
KNOW PERSONALLY.

323
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:09,029
I AM HERE TODAY AS A PROUD

324
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:11,832
AMERICAN AND THE GRANDSON OF

325
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:12,533
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS.

326
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:16,570
DURING WORLD WAR II, MY LATE

327
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,439
GRANDPARENTS RAY AND JOSEPH

328
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:21,041
KUSHNER FLED THEIR HOMES TO

329
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:21,675
ESCAPE NAZI PERSECUTION.

330
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:23,978
SOMEHOW THEY MANAGED TO RESIST

331
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,012
THE HORRORS AND SURVIVE.

332
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:29,517
AFTER THE WAR, THEY BUILT A NEW

333
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:30,718
LIFE IN AMERICA, A BEACON OF

334
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:32,753
HOPE AND A LAND OF LIMITLESS

335
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:33,154
OPPORTUNITY.

336
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:34,221
IN MY OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE

337
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:36,590
I KEEP A PHOTO OF THEM ON MY

338
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,193
DESK TO REMIND ME HOW HIGH THE

339
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:40,728
STAKES ARE WHEN NATIONS FAIL TO

340
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:42,696
RECOGNIZE RIGHT FROM WRONG AND

341
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:44,365
THE DECISIVE POWER AMERICA HAS

342
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:46,967
TO TIP THE SCALES IN FAVOR OF

343
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:47,401
THE RIGHTEOUS.

344
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:56,544
[APPLAUSE]

345
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:58,779
TODAY WE TAKE ANOTHER HISTORIC

346
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:00,981
STEP IN THAT DIRECTION.

347
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,384
I AM CONFIDENT THAT AS A

348
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:07,154
RESULT, OUR NATIONS WILL BE

349
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:08,789
STRONGER, OUR PEOPLES MORE

350
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,658
PROSPEROUS, AND OUR FUTURES

351
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,760
FILLED WITH EVEN GREATER

352
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,928
PROMISE FOR PEACE.

353
00:12:13,928 --> 00:00:00,000
MAY GOD BLESS YOU, MAY GOD
