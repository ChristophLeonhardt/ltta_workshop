00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> our question is why are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carol</font>

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">bartz is days at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo numbered why does</font>

3
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:09,929
she need a miracle to survive well first

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,669
off let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through some charts here</font>

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,580
first off Bing is taking over yahoo

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,859
search air and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bing is microsoft search</font>

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,960
engine and microsoft is a yahoo partner

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,670
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunate situation</font>

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,679
where yahoo is partnered with someone

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,720
who's just hell-bent on taking all of

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,720
their search share and the second big

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,789
point here just macro trends is that

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,310
Yahoo is no longer the most the second

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">most popular website on the in the world</font>

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been taken by Facebook</font>

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,150
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit unfortunate that's</font>

17
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,830
Facebook that's done this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carol</font>

18
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bartz takes every opportunity to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> snicker</font>

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,190
at Facebook saying things like what are

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,740
their revenues like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh only kids</font>

21
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,000
like Facebook that's one of the first

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">things she said on her conference call</font>

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,810
to take the job so it's a little bit

24
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,460
ridiculous considering that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,710
is sort of growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a ridiculous pace</font>

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,790
both with consumers and with advertisers

27
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,440
the other the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> big point here the</font>

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
macro trend is that Yahoo is just not

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,799
nearly as efficient with its employees

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,719
and say Google we've got a chart that

31
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,460
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the comparison is</font>

32
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,500
ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just sort of revenue</font>

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,329
per employee that it's not even it's not

34
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:14,729
even fair comparison in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sense finally</font>

35
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,310
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carol now admits that her big</font>

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,590
strategic moved last fall to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

37
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,270
spend you know tens of millions of

38
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the it's you ad campaign was</font>

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">mistakes she sort of she said it didn't</font>

40
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,270
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to action it didn't</font>

41
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,090
drive new users to the site<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo liked</font>

42
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,159
back then right after the campaign went

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,689
out they like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue that increased</font>

44
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,689
engagement on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was also</font>

45
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,520
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they they launched a new</font>

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,210
front page they there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a number of</font>

47
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,469
reasons where engagement could have gone

48
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,659
up in fact one reason they actually told

49
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,280
us they tried to tell us that engagement

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,679
was up<font color="#CCCCCC"> over in October over September</font>

51
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinks the ad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> campaign by about three</font>

52
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,889
percent well it actually happens to be

53
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that engagement is a measure of page</font>

54
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,100
views and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three percent</font>

55
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,409
more days in october than September

56
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">has something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with it finally</font>

57
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,579
another sign that<font color="#E5E5E5"> carols days are</font>

58
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,770
numbered or that she at least needs a

59
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,869
miracle to sort of turn this company

60
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,599
around is that top talent is leaving

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,269
specifically Yahoo's top ad sales exec

62
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,209
Joanne Bradford yesterday news broke

63
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,549
that she's off running<font color="#CCCCCC"> too she's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

64
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,160
to demand media which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start-up to</font>

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,870
run their ad sales be their chief

66
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,730
revenue officer that's a devastating

67
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">blow to Carol's tenure I mean that's</font>

68
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,510
certainly a strong vote of no confidence

69
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,750
and finally so what so what can Carol do

70
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,209
so Carol Bartz is an excellent operator

71
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:36,410
and she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a good jobs from</font>

72
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,209
streamlining<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo's management</font>

73
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure and cutting and selling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

74
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,650
number of businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really I have</font>

75
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,019
no business<font color="#CCCCCC"> being in so it's not like</font>

76
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:46,970
the cheese just get thrown out on a rear

77
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,170
anything like that we think what should

78
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,349
happen is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo should just go by</font>

79
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">AOL and take tons of these redundant</font>

80
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,209
businesses there's lots of overlapping

81
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,190
media businesses and sales teams and

82
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,620
just cutting cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's millions and</font>

83
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,670
millions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tens of millions of dollars</font>

84
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be saved there by just cutting all</font>

85
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,190
these redundancies Carol moves to the

86
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,010
chairmanship and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim Armstrong who has</font>

87
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,420
done actually a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job sort of</font>

88
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,579
mapping out a strategic vision for AOL

89
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,950
can take that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rah-rah expertise</font>

90
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,680
combined with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surprising strategic</font>

91
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,030
vision that he's sort of displayed and

92
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,079
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reinvigorated yahoo AOL and so</font>

93
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,669
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the company</font>

94
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,280
should do and hopefully that sort of

95
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,720
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> place anyway I'm Nicholas Carlson</font>

96
