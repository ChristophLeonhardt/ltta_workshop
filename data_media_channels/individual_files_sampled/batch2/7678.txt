the questions so many questions were leaked that Robert Muller the special counsel who is investigating collusion obstruction of justice all of the above surrounding the Donald Trump scandals he submitted ostensibly 49 different questions that Donald Trump might have to answer should he submit to actually talking to the special counsel they ended up in the hands of the New York Times we're not sure exactly how they got there who leaked them how they leaked them this is kind of a contentious issue but I'm gonna give you an example of a few examples of the kinds of questions that were asked they revolved around Flynn call me Jeff Sessions and then also just like a bunch of questions that are on everybody's mind it really covered everything on Jeff Sessions here's a sample of a couple questions what did you think and do regarding the recusal of mr. sessions what efforts did you make to try to get him to change his mind did you discuss whether mr. sessions would protect you and reference past attorneys general on Flynn the questions were what did you know about phone calls that mr. Flynn made with the Russian ambassador Sergey kis lyac in late December all the way to how was the decision made to fire Flynn on February 13th 2017 and then just like the stuff you've been wondering about things like what was the purpose of your May 2017 tweet just like a random tweet you know that kind of thing pick a tweet they're kind of asking about whether he should be held responsible it kind of seems for the things he puts out in social media and then also things like what did you mean in your interview with Lester Holt what do you guys think about these questions was there anything that jumped out to you about the questions or what no these are the questions that are are on everyone's minds who are following this case so nothing jumped out in my mind I was actually a little bit surprised at or I guess I'm not that surprised at how open-ended the questions are you know what were you thinking how did you feel you know you know why did you do this there were no specific questions that required a particular answer they're all kind of broad based questions and to me that's because you know as a prosecutor you would ask that you would ask I guess broad-based questions if you're just kind of fishing or trying to explore as many facts as possible you're not trying to cross-examine him and nail him to a certain answer necessarily by asking him very direct questions yeah you know that that bring that's funny I didn't think about it like that about your right how did you feel what were you thinking it's maybe it's it's like a force therapy session you know like how do you feel when you're doing those tweets how do you feel about that would that be great if like Donald Trump came out and goes I was I did the interview and I'm a changed man yeah I'm gonna stop tweeting and it was it's a it's it's a it's a thank you what were you thinking was wrong Robert Mullen Waller is a fantastic person yeah giant mind the biggest mind ever he's wonderful you know what's crazy for me is when I see this it's crazy because now I guess Trump is saying that it was he didn't leave you that his people didn't leak it and we were trying to figure out who leaked it it's this rapid hole that anytime something happens we just go deeper now we're arguing about who leaked the questions right and it's like listen the questions are there and and the only explanation that I've heard so far that makes some sense is that it was that as people have leaked it to because they know he watches TV and they're trying to encourage him not to go exactly we have a video of an interview that someone who used to work for robert muller like who does look like a frightened deer in the headlights I will prime you for that but he is kind of explaining exactly what Moz was referring to let's take a look at that video it would seem to me potentially that the White House counsel's office let this float out into the media in an effort to influence the president's thinking about whether or not to do an interview and I think that they'll gauge reaction of people to these questions and help influence the president to decide whether he should sit down or not sit down I that there's a great debate going on within the White House counsel's office about this and I think this may be one way to try to shape the president's thinking about it in addition to the advice that he's getting from his lawyers yeah the previous presidents you would just sit down with them and say this is important is it that Trump won't take something seriously unless he sees it on television I think that's certainly part of it I also think that he is he's not gonna taking advice from his people and the other problem is that he surrounds himself with sycophants who always tells him what he wants to hear if if you're not a sticker fan they get fired or you get you know cast out in some way but but you know on a separate issue I'm actually not in favor of all of this coverage to be honest why because when there's an investigation I want there to be an investigation and just do the investigation and come back to us when you're done but the constant speculating by the media and the gossipy salacious scandalous nature of it all to me is a distraction from a lot of important issues that we should be covering and now on top of the distractions we have a spectacle on top of a spectacle because now as maz pointed out we have to figure out who leaked it whether them was at us you know what was the purpose so it becomes a circus and and when the circus happens a lot of important stuff even this investigation itself has not taken a backseat to the process of the investigation but you see that's what I think he thrives on yeah is PT Barnum you call it a circus it is a circus I always say he used to have a reality show on one network now he's got a reality show on every network including us everyone's talking about him right before when he was just the apprentice you would tune in on Wednesday maybe the next day if he said something stupid there we make fun of it but now it's 24/7 and he is a master of doing this stuff the reason he tweets on top of this stuff we know he's a liar he the only way this this this actual interrogation there's two ways interrogation works one is they trip him up and he just gets really pissed off and just starts that you know has the with a critical moment right you if that had a God you know that's one way we get the other way that this that we get him is if he does this interview on a lie-detector test which by the way he might pass because he's so good at lying you know but he's a sociopath and so it's you're absolutely right it's a circus and it keeps going and it's like you know what just zip it up do the investigation but then you know what's discouraging is when you find out because everyone everyone who we all know he's lied we all know that he knows there was collusion of course there was good he knows if every man afford Kushner you name it all around him they all met with the Russians at some points so what do you do do you just like when he tweets about this do you ignore it or do you like there's this instinct I have to call him out like I have this graphic like there's a tweet that he we don't have to go to it but I have a graphic setup where he's there's a tweet where he's like you know there's collusion that never existed there's no questions on collusion and then I had prepared like six questions about collusion like it's my instinct to say like all right Donald Trump you see you tweeted this now the options I have are one I can just kind of let it go and then just be like I'm gonna ignore it and I talked to like psychiatrist or like what do you do is that there they say if there's bad behavior just ignore it and it'll stop but at the same time like he still is the President of the United States he still has like this major role am I gonna just let it go or do I have to say well there's a question where it says what do you know about the 27 meeting in the seychelles with Eric Prince what do you know about Ukrainian priests peace proposal on it with mr. Cohen on 2017 what knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign including Paul Manafort to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign those are explicit questions about collusion because I know on the other side trumps fans are all gonna see that tweet and be like you know what there was no questions about collusion in there oh there's no question about collusion I've been in conversations with Trump fans who have said you know what there's no question like they'll take a bite from a lie he's told and just been like that's the truce oh so you're right Brad I mean he is a present United States so you have to cover me just ignore the guy and he does foment this kind of energy and and and the need for coverage at the same time I don't think you're gonna convince anyone who's a trump supporter that he should that they should stop being a supporter because of this investigation or Russia or collusion they're there any other minds made up that these are all lies and they're already on the side I think the way to get to those Trump supporters is to show them how they have been tricked by Trump into supporting him because everything that he promised them is not coming to fruition he didn't bring back hundred percent of the coal mining jobs he hasn't done any for anything for any of the people without actually voted for him even the tax cuts a giant fraud it goes to all the goes to the to the wealthy so so I think there are many issues that we can cover and focus on if your goal is to to bring Trump down and convince a supporter to stop supporting him this is the wrong way to go I think because because what you're really doing here is dividing people to teams and they're already on his team so the so they believe his tweets when he says Muller's a liar Muller is in bed with with with people who are out to get him and the media's fake they already believe that so I don't think arguing with them on Twitter and calling them out as you say really helps helps that much but that's my take on it listen I think you both have good points I think to Brett's point the unfortunate thing is no matter what you say yeah his tweet with his followers is gonna take precedence over whatever your arguments are whatever your arguments are the whole thing we even even logic and so two things first of all just for your own health I bet you if they did an analysis of the level of anxiety in this country its skyrocketed since this guy came in because we all like you just said when I see a tweet from him my instinct is this but I'm gonna get what I'm ready to go man but I but I've tried recently I got kids and I go sometimes I'm sitting there with my phone and I'm like my god put the phone down and talk to your kids like being this moment there's more to life than Donald Trump's tweets now that said you don't ignore it you wait till either late at night we've had a couple drinks and now you go really hardcore out or sometimes like like a tweet will come in my head I'm like oh my god I gotta wake up and send this cuz it feels so good right I mean it does it I think there's probably some psychological thing to it the psychological studies are seen surrounding like should I vent or should I just ignore it right they are this one the venting the initial vent an occasional vent is good yes it releases something that you've kind of been repressing but a consistent venting kind of reinforces the positive the feeling you have after venting and it makes you want to be more negative on a consistent basis and the long-term effect of that is it makes you like a depressed angry person not a clinically depressed but like it makes you what conventional you'd say is depressed but an angrier person yeah it pulls you deep yeah III totally agree with that and you know the thing is I wish we could have investigations there are actual investigations and not political politically motivated nonsense this is a real one this is a real one right and I'm I'm afraid of this becoming a circus too because all the Benghazi investigations were a joke it was how many investigation should we have 57 what's the right thing to take away from these Moeller questions being leaked if anything well I I don't take away from the leaking of it but in terms of the questions themselves I'm happy that he's asking what appears to be the right questions in my opinion so muller go forward god bless do your investigation and let's see what they uncover i'm curious to see what they uncover what I don't like is a media circus surrounding the whole process right yeah there's a couple first first of all the fact that one of the questions I think talks about believing hip he keeps saying Putin said there was no collusion so I'm gonna believe him over my own intelligence and so at first you think oh maybe it's his ego because he thinks if Putin helped him win then that means he didn't really win but you go deeper and you go no he definitely knows some things were done and it's this deny deny deny it reminds me of the eddie murphy joke where he goes right when he gets cut caught and goes if your wife catches you having sex with someone I wasn't meat wasn't me and then once you but here's now here's where it turns because his followers I think even if we get stuff that prove that he was guilty they will listen to he can he can you know pivot so in the in the joke anymore if he goes yeah baby I after but I make loved to easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're at EIT subscriber
