1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,360
The founder of the company said her carpets
should be as music.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,680
She was the composer,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,220
and the weavers were the musicians

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,960
and you when you walk on the carpet you listen to the music.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,780
In the Marta Maas studio we're doing useful
art textiles.

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,800
Marta Maas she was an artist and she was
so fascinated over the Oriental carpets that

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,790
she saw 100 years ago.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,060
We are still producing her carpets and we
have more than almost 1,000 different designs.

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,160
It's an honor to get to know her through her
work, her design, her sketches.

10
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,100
When we have a client put an order of a special
carpet here, the weavers start lining up the

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,840
threads for the warp.

12
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,860
The warp is the backbone, it's the spine of
the carpet.

13
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,480
It should bear the carpet all its life.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,870
That's almost always flax or linen.

15
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,190
And we are winding them up going round and
round and it's really important so that all

16
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,740
threads are exactly the same length.

17
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,100
And we are taking them down from the spinning
wheel.

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,780
And then you invite your colleagues
to come to a bomnings party.

19
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,280
It's when you set the warp in the loom.

20
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,040
We thread them through steel eyes.

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,070
So it's going to be really tight and it's
going to be really even.

22
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,299
We are many and we are talking and laughing
and we know it's a start for a new project

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,300
so it's really a good day when we are doing
bomning.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,699
We have about 8 tons of yarn in 1600 - 1700
different colors.

25
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,780
And if we're missing something we need to
dye it and then we have white wool coming

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,010
from Sweden or Norway and it needs to be really
strong and good wool and not the sweater wool,

27
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,080
not soft and nice.

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,520
We use the synthetic, reactive colors.

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,630
We have three pigment colors: red and blue
and yellow.

30
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,940
And all these three colors you do everything
with.

31
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,140
If you're really used to working with colors
you can see maybe twice or three times as

32
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,160
much as normal people.

33
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,620
Marta Maas Fjetterstrom lived her last
22 years on the coastline here in Bastad.

34
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,320
But she grew up where there were a lot of
trees and flowers.

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,550
Carpet was not common in Sweden, before that
we had sand and plants on the floor that we

36
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,489
were forming in nice patterns so it's really
the nature that has got inspiration to the

37
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,480
different carpets.

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,940
What artists are not inspired by nature?

39
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,400
What human being is not inspired by nature?

40
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,340
We get all the yarns ready and we wind it
up into small balls in the right combinations

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,440
of colors and threads.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,300
We always prepare that before we start doing
the flat weave carpet, it's called rollakan

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,640
in Swedish.

44
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,000
Different techniques can give you different
solutions but in the rollakan the wool is

45
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,230
going between the warp.

46
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,680
It's really strong and it's reversible, so
it's a really old technique in the very cold countries.

47
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,800
You have different kinds of working instructions
for different carpets and it's built up by

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,620
small squares.

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,769
It's really important for us to pass on the
knowledge from generation to generation and

50
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,310
we do that by sitting two and two in the looms.

51
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,310
It might take a year to do a carpet so you
sit beside the same weaver day out and day in

52
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,430
and of course you know everything about
each other so you could rest together with

53
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,430
the other person.

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,460
It's like walking in silence, you can work
in silence beside each other.

55
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,680
Eventually when you are finished with your
carpet now is the cutting down and you're

56
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,180
allowed to see the whole carpet because you
have stored it during the process of weaving.

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,310
It's like waiting for a baby coming, you know
that it is there, you feel it, you can see it

58
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,200
you have been through everything but you
don't know exactly what will come out.

59
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,380
And after that the carpet need to rest and
we do some flattening.

60
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,830
We just nail it to the floor and putting just
a little bit of water, and then we put wooden

61
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,010
plates on.

62
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,600
So it's going to stay there for
4 or 5 days and then it's ready to be rolled

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,020
and packed and then shipped to the owner.

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,560
I've been talking to so many clients and they
could see their whole life in the carpet.

65
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,720
They could see their children growing up,
the parties, the divorces, the quarrels the

66
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,630
happiness the sadness so it's focusing
the whole lifetime to one room, to one spot,

67
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,310
to one carpet.

68
00:05:44,310 --> 00:00:00,000
It's really a joy and a pleasure to make something
that lasts.
