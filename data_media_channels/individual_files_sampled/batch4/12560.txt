slash Shapiro they know that we sent you as well okay so I just want to remind everyone of how terrible what happened in Charlotte all over the weekend was there was some footage that came out yesterday that we weren't able to show on the show cuz it came out later here is here's drone footage of what happened in Charlottesville when this 20 year old piece-of-crap decided to drive his car into a crowd of anti neo-nazi anti can't I kneel Confederate anti alt-right protesters you can see it from the staff right and see this red car being pushed into the crowd and people being killed one person died from this and another 19 were injured pretty frightening and horrifying and then of course the car reversed itself and drove off in the other direction just horrifying stuff okay so with that in the background we're going to get to a lot today I want to talk about President Trump's new response yesterday he finally came out and gave a speech that he should have given unsanded afterward which were not helpful to him we're going to talk about the left which has lost its mind so the left always is going to turn this into a referendum on the entire right it doesn't matter the people like me have been the lead antagonist of the alt-right for well over a year they were always going to turn this into some sort of club that they could wield against the entire right and against the Trump administration in particular claiming that everyone in the Trump administration must be smeared with this broad brush of all right ISM and racism and bigotry and that is really nasty and actually it's exacerbating the problems what you're seeing is two sides as I spoke about yesterday and keifa on the one side and the alt-right on the other side and the mainstream left focus on the alt-right and willingness to adhere to an FIFA and the mainstream rights willingness to ignore the outright and their willingness to go after and keifa alone means that both the alt-right in antifa will grow okay we're now in a self-perpetuating cycle where auntie Fudd says we have to stop the fascists and then they act violently and the right says well we're going to side with anybody who acts violently the way these antiva people are the alt-right must not be that bad which of course leads the left to say well and people must not be that bad because the alt-right represents a broad swath of the right and therefore we have to fight them tooth and nail because hitler's around the corner and they just keep reinsuring the importance of one another and you can see it from the left so the left's activities in the aftermath of Charlotte still have been absolutely egregious not just the stuff they're saying the stuff that there's it'll start the stuff they're saying joy read over at MSNBC she came out yesterday and she said white nationalists are everywhere they're behind your bed they're under there behind your curtains they're inside your closets and they're all over the White House here's Joey Reed making this case what is the alt-right it's a dressed-up term for white nationalism they call the white identitarian ISM they say that though tribalism that's sort of inherent in the human spirit ought to be also applied to white people that is who is in his government Sebastien Gorka who wore the metal the Vitesse here and a Nazi organization being paid by the taxpayer in the government of Donald Trump the former Publius des blogger Michael Anton in the government he is surrounded by these people it isn't both thought he's in the white house they're in the white house with him okay so the two people that you mentioned are particularly bad example Sebastien Gorka is not anti-semitic you know the stories about him hanging out with the far-right in Hungary there's some truth to him hanging out with the far-right in Hungary but there's no evidence of his anti-semitism per se and in the attempts to to link the metal that he's been wearing around to Nazism are really overblown there was a whole article in that debunked the debunk the article in the foreword I think it's from the Atlantic that's amongst a lot of this stuff so the gore because a bad example and Michael Anton as much as I dislike Michael Anton's writing and think his flight 93 election essay was garbage he is not a white nationalist and so she's picking bad examples it just demonstrates have left is tempted to use the alt-right brush to paint everyone rich Lowry who's sitting there actually went on to chide Roy read for doing exactly that and it's just it's just foolish of the left to do this because the more they do this the more they push more people into the arms of the alt-right a lot of people say well if the alright is people like Michael Anton in Sebastian Lorca I guess maybe I'm alright no you're not because those guys aren't really alright ok the alt-right is Richard Spencer Jared Taylor they're a bunch of popularizers who have tried to mainstream it by changing the definition and the left is helping out in that quest meanwhile you see the black lives matter co-founder coming out and saying that hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment this is an actual threat to the First Amendment of the United States we saw yesterday Texas A&M cancelled some sort of rally the some white nationalist rally the under threat of violence this is scary okay it's not just scary cuz they're white supremacists but it's scary because free speech is right that all of us have even the people who I think are garbage and have terrible terrible views here's black lives matter saying that if Tate speech then it's not protected by the First Amendment eminently untrue white nationalists are actually fighting to take away people's rights black lives matter and groups like black lives matter are fighting for equality and hate speech which is what we're seeing coming out of white nationalist groups is not protected on the First Amendment right and so I think that's important that we really delineate what's happening right now it's not number one okay hate speech is of course protected by the First Amendment and when it comes to BLM trying to claim that you know only one side is promulgating hate speech I mean there are there videos of people at BLM rallies shouting pigs eat pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon I talking about cops okay you remember that it was a guy who's very sympathetic to the means and motives of BLM who shot a bunch of cops in Dallas a year and a half ago I'm not saying BLM is to blame for that I am saying that BLM is program is hardly is hardly a nothing okay it's hardly just we're trying to defend laws and they've been incredibly anti cop they've incentivize people in Ferguson in Baltimore to riot and yet they say that all of their enemies must be shut down this is the danger point okay we're reaching the danger point where people on the Left say that the alt-right has to be legitimately shut down not for violence but because of what they say and people on the all right say the people on the left like an Tifa a representative of the entire lapsed okay we're really at a Vimal republic point where you're seeing battles in the streets and they've been going on for months you're seeing the left exacerbate this so that i understand that the media is all of their sympathy is with the left here because they think that an Tifa is not that bad many of them they think Antiqua is just anti-fascist that's not just when mpa is the communist the anarchist group that has protested normal conservatives normal Republicans in Portland Peter Bernard white usually despised wrote a great piece over at the Atlantic talking about what n FIFA has done in cities like Portland where just a normal group of Republicans wanted to march in their Rose Parade and the entire Rose Parade had to be canceled because Han Tifa was threatening okay so you've got a bunch of violent people in the streets from Antigua and among violent people from the all right sometimes in response like in Sacramento and sometimes as in Charlottesville it's unclear who's actually starting the violence we just don't know yet but it's not getting better when the left cheers on people who are moving outside the modes of law in order to enact their suppose an agenda so here's some video yesterday this happened over in Durham North Carolina and here's a picture here's of protestors toppling Confederate soldiers monument you can see how this is working the toppling the monument destroying the monument and then cheering like they've done something grand and glorious and then kicking the statue because ma I broke my toe fighting racism the statue was dedicated in 1924 authorities greased the statue with cooking spray to help make it harder to Klimt and they stood around while they well this happened where the cops for all of us okay so the people United will never be defeated its divided guys I mean if you're going to get your chance get it right but then they're all standing around there's video of these people jumping on top of the statue and kicking the statute congratulations you ended racism by tearing down a Confederate statue nobody knew about or cared about and was erected in 1924 I'm sure that you didn't impose in the alt-right in any way by doing this sort of thing by by vandalizing property again there's a case to be made and I've said this before I certainly see the case for taking Confederate monuments and moving them into into museums moving them off of public property I see the case for that I don't see the case for destroying it this looks like you know it's not like Isis because these people aren't Isis but there's a there's a an attempt in the human soul to to rip away history that you don't like supposedly because you're going to fix the future but that's not the case I mean honestly you know I live as a Jew I live in a world where our events still exist in Germany I want that to exist in Germany I want people to visit it I want people to know that the threat of Auschwitz is still a thing and that people should be aware of that I think I fully understand why a lot of black folks and a lot of white folks would like to see Confederate monuments taken away because it's a reminder of an era when slavery was was fought and defended at the same time you have to acknowledge that a lot of the people who had grant a great-grandfather's who fought for the Confederacy were not fighting for slavery there are a lot of Confederates who are fighting because they thought that the north was encroaching on southern states right okay I understand that this is an historic is historically accurate but may not may not be popular the fact is that civil war was over slavery but it was also over states rights was over both of those things and to pretend that there's only over one of those things is to neglect the actual history of the situation because the fact is that even when the North went into the Civil War it was meaning to abolish slavery the Emancipation Proclamation only happened a couple of years into the Civil War it was over slavery but it was over more than that that does not justify the Confederacy of course thank God the Confederacy lost that is a wonderful thing the Confederacy lost the rebels should have lost the people who fought to divide the country so they could preserve slavery we're doing something evil okay but to pretend that they're to pretend that people who have Confederate ancestors when they take Confederate monuments are immediately think of enslaving black people is just not true and it's not accurate at least for the vast majority of them tearing down statues like this again we have a rule of law in this country you want to do this vote for people who are going to remove the memorial vote for people who are going to remove the memorial don't just destroy things but I think this what we're seeing here is actually part of the same movement that wants to chip Woodrow Wilson's name off buildings at Princeton and wants to tear down statues of Thomas Jefferson and that's a very dangerous ideology and then beyond that the violence that you're seeing here the vandalism that you're seeing where are the cops tearing down monuments in breaking the law to do so we have a democracy we have a republic and the mayors of Lexington in Baltimore they're removing Confederate monuments their elected officials they can do that this idea that you're going to go around tearing down monuments and that this is somehow similar to tearing down monuments of saddam hussein in the aftermath of saddam hussein's fall is just inane it's just innate and all its doing is embolden the alt-right which is going to a lot of people and saying look at these vandals these people who have no respect for America's history because yes the Confederacy was a dark part but a part of America's history and to pretend that it wasn't is historically ignorant you're embolden ilan the all right this sort of behavior is not purposeful this sort of behavior is not helpful you want to protest against the alright by all means do it your honor protests racism by all means do it tearing down public property is not the way to do this all you're doing is driving people against you and then it's driving again this is this cycle of nastiness you know that these examples go on and on yesterday over at in New York a bunch of protesters protesting at Trump Tower because they didn't like Trump statements over charlotte's though fine fare but then there's this video of this woman screaming at the cops for no apparent reason even though we're doing what we were done your eyes weak because you know you're wrong cuz you think you're a man you can roll your eyes on a young woman roll your eyes your shoot doesn't protect you and just what is a LIFO person screaming at people who are trying to protect the President of the United States at Trump Tower and saying that they are they are the bad guys again none of this is helpful to the anti-racist cause none of this is helpful to the coming together of Americans none of it is helpful on the left is getting worse okay because I think that now the left is celebrating the punching of Nazis look at look at the coverage of Charlottesville I pointed out yesterday I open with all of the video from Charlottesville and I pointed out there are a lot of violent people on the left there Cheryl gage Solberg who is there from the New York Times said as much and now what you're seeing is whitewashing of an tyfa in order to go after the all right I don't see why you have to whitewash one in order to go after the other I went after the all right pretty hard yesterday I will continue to go after them hard I think they're disgusting movement and I think that a lot of people have been seduced into believing they're not as disgusting as they are but that does not excuse violence it does not excuse vandalism it does not excuse abusing police officers none of this is worthwhile none of this is worthwhile unfortunately it's all getting worse I want to talk about President Trump's response to all of this but before I do I first want to say thank you so our sponsor over at USC CA so you would do anything to protect your family and keep them safe of course and so what a guy named Gary gross he was the he was just in his house and two intruders broke into his Cincinnati home this last week according to ABC News his wife and infant son were sleeping in a back room Gary grabbed a hammer and confronted the strange men in the following struggle out number two two one Gary retrieved his gun he shot the men before they could endanger his family's lives he was lucky that he was prepared when he decided to make that life-altering decision but when you are facing an unexpected threat you don't want to have to think about the plan you're going to come up with you don't have time to think about that and that's why it's important to have you SEC air by your side to prepare you for the unthinkable go to defend my family now calm and can see the world-class training and resources their self-defense training and resources and they also have invaluable self-defense coverage so in case you actually have to shoot somebody you know one be stuck in the court system for

ECA helps you out with all of that defend my family now calm defend my family now calm n right now when you activate your bonus you activate your membership you get a free entry to win a gun today so you can be prepared to defend yourself and your loved ones defend my family now calm let's defend my family now calm so go over and check that out to defend yourself from an increasingly violent world and it's getting scary out there okay so president Trump decides that he is going to that he is going to finally change his statement he made on Saturday as you recall Rhonda the President of the United States made a statement on Saturday in which he said that there was violence and bigotry on all sides all sides and he didn't specifically single out the alt-right he didn't single out the Nazis he didn't sink without any of that and and the result of that was that there was a lot of blowback and I think right blowback I think it was correct to have blowback I think President Trump didn't do enough to disassociate himself from the alt-right which he'd sort of been winking at there was a report yesterday that Steve Bannon had been telling him over the weekend Steve Danon who is his White House chief strategist I got a guy know well former head of Breitbart a man who said that he was happy that he had turned Breitbart into basically a forum for the alt-right a guy who helps prop up figures like Milo who were popularizing the alt right and and so Trump didn't say anything and apparently was very angry that he had to go out and make a statement yesterday so let's reenact yesterday with President Trump so president Trump starts off the day by going after the head of Merck so Merck is a major pharmaceutical company the CEO and Kenneth Fraser was on the CEO of Merck and he was on president Trump's manufacturing board after Trump didn't come out strongly enough in his opinion and condemned the outright and white nationalism to white supremacism he quit the board and from when to out and tweeted remember this before he's made any overt statement with regard to the alt writer the KKK or anything he tweeted Merck pharma is a leader in higher and higher drug pirate prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the US bring jobs back and lower prices so to leads off yesterday and people like really this is where you're putting your focus you're putting your focus on the Merck head everybody thinks that you need to come out and condemn the alt-right everybody thinks you need to come out and condemn white supremacism if you want to condemn a thief at the same time that would be nice if you want to do all those things you can do those things and instead he's tweeting about Merck so finally yesterday afternoon right about the time that we were finishing filming the show Trump gave a statement and here was Trump's statement about racism and finally condemning me all writer and groups associated with y'alright by name racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the KKK neo-nazis white supremacist and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans we are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal we are equal in the eyes of our Creator we are equal under the law and we are equal under our Constitution those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America two days ago a young American woman Heather Hare was tragically killed her death fills us with grief and we send her family our thoughts our prayers and our love okay good good for Trump for saying this right this is what everybody wanted him to say she just had 48 hours earlier the long delay let a lot of give a lot of credence a lot of the groups that were claiming that Trump was on their side you remember I read yesterday the the Nazi out with the daily stormer coming out and praising from for not going too hard on the white nationalist yesterday he blasts them and then what's interesting is that okay what's the fallout so that 48-hour gap creates a series of alt-right people who go out and say well Trump is really sort of defending us isn't it you know his silence means something to us and a bunch of people I'm left saying his silence mean something obviously to the alright and then Trump says this and you know he condemns them and the OLT rights response is well he didn't really mean it right like now he really didn't mean it because he's coming out he's doing this after pressure so according to Olivia nosey who is a reporter I believe for Politico she says Richard Spencer doesn't think president Trump condemns his movement today he called it kumbaya nonsense and said Trump didn't mean it only - who cares about that right maybe Richard Spencer is just wrong Trump does mean it and it's great that Trump did it and good okay but then five minutes after the speech you know a few minutes after the speech Trump goes right back on Twitter and is he going after the is he going after the is he going after the alright on Twitter is he retweeting his own speech about racism no he's going back after the mirth guy he decides that it is important that he must go after the Merc guy again so he tweets again about the Merc guy you know going after him because he said he's a bad guy then he goes on Twitter after that and he decides that it is necessary to tweet about the media so here is what he tweeted he tweeted quote made additional remarks on charlottesville and realized once again that the fake news media will never be satisfied truly bad people this is just not smart it's not smart and it's not moral okay the reason that you should make that additional statement on charlottesville is because the first one was insufficient it was morally insufficient you have to condemn the bad guys what Trump sounds like he's saying here ok if I were just to read this as a layman when it sounds like he's saying is that the reason that he made the remarks in the first place is because the fake news media we're pushing him to do so and then they wouldn't accept him saying what he was saying in other words he was fine with not saying anything additional this of course lends a lot of credence to the stuff that Spencer was saying that really the only reason that Trump was doing this is because he was pressured but deep down in the cockles of his heart he really didn't want to condemn me all right he really didn't want to condemn the white supremacist mr. Trump President Trump I don't think that you're racist I don't think you're a white supremacist I don't think you're an alt writer please stop making moves that are that are that are even open to question okay this is so obvious and this is so easy and when you blame the fake news media for being mean to you because you made a bad statement on Saturday by the way the reports are that there was a second statement that he had in front of him on Saturday that was exactly the same as the statement he made yesterday and he went off cup because he didn't actually want to discuss the white supremacy on Saturday right there was that report that came out yesterday okay it's not good stuff the President of the United States agenda is determined by the president actually being strong enough of will being strong enough morally to stand up against bad people and the idea that he is going to sort of bend over backwards to appease this this and this all right movement is really gross I mean it's it's such a problem this another example right yes sir last night from the president decides that it is important to tweet a couple of things and he tweets he tweets this is this morning he retweeted at 4:40 a.m. this is his meme and the mean says fake news can't stop the Trump train and then it's a picture of the train hitting reporter with the CNN logo over it now we've already had Trump do this right I mean Trump already did the thing with the with him tackling the meme from the alt-right of him tackling the the CNN logo had in the entire world going nuts but this is three days after a car hit anti all tripe protesters and now he's tweeting out a picture of a train hitting CNN okay it's just not smart it's just not smart and the account he tweeted from apparently is an all right account okay yesterday last night he tweets out an account guess the guy's name is Jack cassabi ACK you'll remember him from such hits as storming the stage the Julius Caesar production in Central Park he's an alt right friendly figure and inject asabi Ike was also a pizza gate promulgator and he tweeted something out about how there were 35 people who were shot in Chicago over the weekend why no one wise known paying attention to that and Trump elite retweeted it now if Trump wants to say listen there's killings all over the country a lot there are a lot of things that we need to do to stop them that's one thing but retweeting people who are sort of part of the the alt-right alt-right friendly base it does not help his case that he's trying to separate off from this group and he should be separating off from this group okay it's an immoral group it's an immoral group and it's not that everyone who likes means everyone who tweets means as a member of the alt-right I discussed this yesterday but the alt-right has effectively used the Internet to seize the high grounds of sort of meme territory and then use it as a way to spread the word so I have a brief story about this that I think is worth telling so I was speaking at a California college last year and this California College was you know a lot of the conservatives had decided to ask me there and we go to dinner afterward which is one of the things that I tend to do with the college Republican groups that I that I get invited by so we were sitting there having a good time we're talking and one of the guys pipes up and says that they just found a Milo and I said that's great you know whatever you know that's that's fine and and he is at the end of the dinner he waits till the end of dinner and everybody is filing out the door and this fellow turns to me and he said any kind of winked at me quietly he's wearing a mag a hat and went to me quietly and he says another show on okay for people don't know that means another show is one of these alt-right anti-semitic memes suggesting that all jews do is talk about the Holocaust all day long right that everything is another show I show us it works a Holocaust and they don't say another they say another right a and udda H not a show up because you're stupid you keep talking about the Holocaust you terrible Jews and the guys looked at me and said this and he obviously meant it as like a wink wink nod nod joke and I just thought to myself why would you think that that's okay I'm not going to like ruin your life over it I don't think your life ought to be ruined over but why would you think that that's okay because the joke is not you know mocking anti-semitism the joke is actually anti-semitic whereas the joke itself is actually anti-semitic like I'm on steven crowder show a lot and Stevens a great guy and Steven makes a lot of you know jokes about Jews right he'll talk about how my he doesn't like the fact that we have this beautiful tumblr because he has his own mug club until make a joke about hard tumblr stinks but we filled it with Google's right the whole point of him doing that is not because he's actually a medic the point is he's mocking himself for pretending to be anti-semitic that's the point of the joke well point of the joke is that anti-semitism stupid that's the entire point of the joke that's why when Steven doesn't it's not offensive the point of the another Shoah means is not that anti-semitism is stupid it's not self parenting right it's that the Jews actually there's something nefarious about the Jews like it is an answer somatic joke this stuff is being passed around by people who don't know about our I don't think akin was an anti-semite I think the kid was perfectly nice kid I think the kid was being dragged into this meme under culture where being frivolous and trolli is seen as a positive good because anything that pisses off sjw's anything where people are triggered means it's a good thing and so this idea that if you trigger people that's a good thing people sided with Trump because they felt like he triggered people ticking off the left is more important than being decent or being right and that's really a negative thing this is how people get sucked into the mob they all right not because they start off as white supremacists but because they believe that anything that trolls left must inherently be decent or good it's a dangerous dangerous thing okay and again not everybody who loves memes is is a member of the alt-right and vast majority people who like memes are not members of the alright but this is how the outright recruits is how the alt-right seduces they say it's they say we're just being dissidents and trolling and we're tweeting out anti-semitic and racist memes and it's because the left can't take a joke that they don't like your stuff not because they don't like racism or anti-semitism but because they can't take a joke and then that is not positive in any way and the right needs to excise that and president Trump please for the love of God stop associating with people from the allright and retweeting them I understand you think that a solid part of your base I understand maybe Steve Bannon has told you there a part of your base you can't afford to alienate or the President of the United States for God's sake you represent the entire country be a man and reject these groups stop retweeting them stop reaching out to them these are not people you want to be associated with these are not people who are winning the meme allure for you he didn't win the election because of the meme war I understand the alt-right likes to say that you won because of the me more memes are funny memes are wonderful you didn't win because of the meme or you won because Hillary Clinton was the worst candidate in the history of mankind and I want to get to the the media then and how they've reacted to all this and what I thought was an egregious segment on CNN yesterday plus it we have things I like things I hate then deconstructing the culture but before we get to any of that person I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so right now obviously things feel very chaotic a North Korea continues to be a global threat Russia continues to be a global threat al Qaeda and Isis continue to be threat and

Patriot supply prepare with Ben comprehend calm ok so last night on CNN but the media have decided that the part of the problem here is the media likes the ratings they get off of all this stuff I mean there is part of the media that that is overjoyed when this sort of stuff happens because the controversy drives ratings and the left is eager always to label everyone as I say a member of the alt-right no matter whether they're a member of the alt-right or not and last night on CNN this panel just devolved because there was a Trump fan in Paris Denard who was a bush staffer and Keith Boykin who's a Democratic staffer and in Boykin just goes directly after Denard and basically says he's not black I'm offended that you continue to go there Paris but the reality is that President Trump has not done enough and I'm ashamed that you as an African American Paris will not say that well truth I don't need you to talk about my black card I am well aware of my blackness and don't need you to try to classify me as being one I understand what race are you i teeth don't go there do not go there I know what it means to be a black man in this country I know and I experience racism on a regular basis by being a trump supporter and by being a proud American who happens to be a Republican I give up making us earn your business i get racist i got rivers i'm in about nine and family about my mother about my girlfriend about my character we every single day remotely coming world black nerd or even if you really want to get down to it i'm from my family from georgia Keith let me finish my family from Georgia we have members of our family that went missing because of the KKK taking them up so don't come to me and tell me about what it is be a black person in this country I fought every day and the George Tenet is why our house I have to eat that meat in it calm down no no I won't calm down because I will not be attacked by you about my blackness because I happen to be a Republican and I listen to our president when you want to is going off the rails here I going on on Israel okay so the fact is that para cenar has every reason to lash out to keep Boykin for what Keith Boykin just said but this is the sort of stuff the media loves to promulgate and it's just pushing the conflict to a higher and higher pitch none of this is good all of it is frightening okay

like today I want to do an oldie but a goodie because it's it's I think almost indicative of where we've gone as a country these two books that I'm about to talk about so Harper Lee wrote one of the great American classics of course To Kill a Mockingbird and it is a phenomenal book it is a truly phenomenal book I remember reading this book I think I was probably nine when I read To Kill a Mockingbird for the first time and it is a brilliant beautifully written piece about the power of not only tolerance but fighting for fighting for the right it's just it's just terrific the movie itself is also very good you'll spot a very young Robert Duvall is Boo Radley actually in the movie he's in it for five seconds but to Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee just a grand grand book the whole book about is really an ode to to scout is the main character her father Atticus Finch then Atticus Finch of course one of the great American literary heroes is a lawyer who defends an innocent black man accused of a crime and it's it's all about what it takes in what what heroism requires and sometimes it's quiet and sometimes it just requires standing up for the right things but what I was going to say is that it demonstrates where we've gone into countries in the last couple of years in an attempt to make some profit the there is another version of this book that Harper Lee wrote that was never published right it was originally written in the mid-1950s and it was the first novel that Harper submitted publishers and was rejected it's called go set a watchman and it features a lot of the characters from tequila Mockingbird some twenty years later and it's about scout realizing that her dad was actually a racist and her dad was actually not so nice and all this kind of stuff and this is the monster of the fact that To Kill a Mockingbird is about the American dream and how we need more Americans like Atticus Finch in order to achieve the American dream and go set a watchman is about how the American Dream doesn't really exist even the people who you think are heroes are actually villains we have to get away from go set a watchman and back to to kill a mockingbird we all need to be idolizing Atticus Finch we all need to be moving in that direction and we need to get away from the world where everyone's a villain so if Atticus Finch is a villain we all might as well be villains you know the sort of sullying of the Atticus Finch character and go to Watchmen is really one of the literary tragedies of the last ten years and it's um you should read the original and ignore the rewriting in go set a watchman that was only released for profit after Harper Lee was unclear whether Harper Lee was even competent to release it apparently but the tequila Mockingbird is is again one of my favorite novels okay time for some things that I hate so I haven't talked to Jeff and I think that it is and I think that worth while noticing a couple of things so we'll start with dennis prager so Dennis preggers friend of mine and in Dennis was almost rejected from conducting with the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra a Walt Disney Concert Hall the left tried to destroy Dennis they tried to suggest that Dennis was a racist and a sexist and a bigot and a homophobe and therefore he shouldn't be allowed to conduct the Santa Monica Symphony at Walt Disney Concert Hall about 2300 seats and he was he was pushed not to conduct the heightened Symphony number 51 there were two UCLA professors and in Michael Chiu and Andrew after they're both violinist with the Santa Monica Symphony and they wrote in an open letter please urge your friends to not attend this concert which helps normalize bigotry and our community Prager is a right-wing radio host who promotes horribly bigoted positions Dennis does not promote horribly bigoted positions of course it's just another demonstration the left attempts to lump everyone in with the alt-right and that's why it is so important both at the left stop doing that and at the right actively separate itself from the all right and from the racists who would hang around the fringes and pretend to be important members of the movement this stuff is not justifiable and Dennis Dennis is one of the good guys and the idea that Disney Hall should have been closed to to Dennis just demonstrates the intolerance of the left it's it's quite ridiculous so it didn't work the New York Times wrote an article on the issue The Hollywood Reporter wrote an article on the issue and it just shows that when the right stands up and says we're not going to stand for being called racist sexist biggest homophobes when we're not then people back down but in order for that to work you actually have to not associate with racist sexist bigots and homophobes which of course the vast majority of people who are conservative don't the Allred is not a conservative movement it's an anti conservative movement and pretending that they're just a trolli version of the Conservatives is really not true it's a bad that it's bad definitionally okay other things that I hate so the Washington Post's trying to hit the Trump campaign yesterday and it's just amazing the way that the Washington Post tries to get away with hitting Trump even when it's unjustified so the Washington host had an article titled Trump campaign emails show aids repeated efforts to set up Russia's meetings okay from that headline you would gathered that someone in the Trump campaign was actively attempting to set up meetings with the Russians with the with the oversight of the Trump campaign but the article itself says in paragraph three the proposal sends a ripple of concern through campaign headquarters in Trump Tower campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis wrote that he thought NATO ally should be consulted before any plans were made another Trump adviser cited legal concerns including a possible violation of US sanctions okay and that so in other words the documents show that Trump tried to fight back right it from the Trump campaign tried to fight back against this this particular efforts to set up some sort of meeting with the Russians so sort of undercuts the the Russian narrative that's not what the headline says just another example of the media blowing up a story that really is an exculpatory story for Trump into something that is not exculpatory okay final thing that I hate and it'll deconstruct a little bit of culture the final thing that I hate here is again just showing that the left has no clue what they're doing and they're actually pushing more people into the arms of the alright this is from the New York Times after a day of work at the engineering Research Center at University of Arkansas Kyle Quinn had a pleasant Friday night in bentonville with his wife and a colleague explored an art exhibition and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and dined in an upscale restaurant then on Saturday he discovered that social medias wootz had incorrectly identified him as a participants in a white nationalist rally some 1,100 miles away in Charlottesville over night thousands of strangers across the country have been working to share photographs of men Darren tiki torches on the University of Virginia campus but he were there was a guy at the rally who's photographed wearing an Arkansas engineering shirt and amateur investigators found a photo of Quinn that looked something something similar and that was enough to go after Quinn and they basically ruined his life people demanded he lose his job people accused him of racism people posted his home address on social networks he and his wife stayed with a colleague this weekend okay again that the fever pitch in this country it needs to it needs to calm down this is insanity he can't target innocent people because you're attempting to get the guilty this is just nuts folks ok the sort of daxing of people it has to stop it has to stop just Wow Wow okay time to deconstruct the culture a little bit so one of the things that I hate about the modern pop culture is the attempt to virtually signal we talked about this in recent weeks affair but the cultural figures who feel the need to virtue signal on politics because they think that it's going to make them more pop culturally the sort of popular that is going to is going to draw more support it's really it's really foolish so one of the people who's doing this was of course Lord Lord not like God lor D the e the young New Zealand singer Lorde was she wanted Royals is that her group okay yeah so she a she did the song Royals she's like a one-hit wonder I'm not sure she's ever done anything else but she's done saying she's done some other stuff okay Mathis is more with it than I am he's a decade younger than I am so he's still ensconced in this in this idiotic culture so Lord a lordy Lord alo tardy she she tweeted out being a privileged white non-us citizen I feel like tweeting to reinforce how horrific people of color treatment here is is unnecessary and inappropriate okay and then she says I just want to say I'm so so sorry all white people are responsible for this systems thrive and fall we have to do better I'm sorry who is we I didn't do any of these things and I think all the people who did these things are despicable and I've spent my career fighting these people so who is we like that you wonder why there's an identity politics of the right maybe that is because there's an anti white identity politics you know the white identity politics a lot of that the growth of that is a direct response to the identity politics of the left would suggest that the color of your skin makes you responsible for the sins of other white people I am NOT responsible pretty sin committed by a white person just because I am white you are not responsible for the sin of a black person just because you are black this insanity that suggests that race confers guilt or innocence upon you that ethnicity confers guilt or innocence upon you it's just that it's insanity and the virtue signaling by pop cultural figures for attempting to make it clear to their audience just how woke they are the Katy Perry looking like she came back from college as a lesbian dance theory major and sitting with DeRay McKesson cross-legged on the couch talking about her cultural responsibility look if you didn't do anything wrong we live in an individual culture okay I don't believe in social in social justice because I believe in justise if you didn't do anything wrong you are not guilty if I didn't do anything wrong I am not guilty if you did do something wrong you are guilty and if I did something wrong I am guilty otherwise no guilt no innocence okay your moral status is neutral if you haven't done anything you do have a duty to come out and condemn racism when you see it as a moral human being but that does not make you complicit when in racism if you do the right thing doing the right thing is you doing the right thing I mean I don't know when we why is it that we have to do like third grade morality for people again this is insane okay other things that I hate in the culture so I've been lamenting the politicization of sports for for several years now particularly over at ESPN one of the shows that I used to enjoy watching a lot more on ESPN was pardon the introduction with Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon they're both really clever guys they know a lot about sports I used to be a big fan of the show but now it seems like it's just two lefties going back at each other on every topic Under the Sun and that's really boring it's really boring ESPN has made a huge mistake by attempting to excise everyone who has a different point of view people like Curt Schilling people like Mike Ditka people like Chris Broussard you know all these people been marginalized or thrown out because they have conservative points of view and so you end up with stuff like this on ESPN again sports fans tend to be overwhelmingly conservative actually the majority of sports fans particularly NFL fans for example are our conservative most most NFL fans by the polls the ones I've seen say that they're conservative but nonetheless you have situations like ESPN's Tony Kornheiser saying that we should just stop playing the national anthem at sporting events altogether I think it's a lot and I worry that maybe I say it so much that people pay no attention anymore this is a constitutional right this is a guaranteed thing if you don't want to stand for the anthem you don't have to a lot of times I say it in half jest but I'm getting to the point where it's not even half just anymore I don't even know why they've lady anthem I think I'll play the Beach Boys I like the beach I would me personally and I think you two I would stand for the answer yeah what if you don't it's like not some troublesome to me if you don't do this okay why is okay so it should be troublesome when people don't stand for our common anthem because there's one thing you should hope is that the anthem comes to embody what you want it to embody a suggesting that America is thoroughgoing race as racist is nonsense of course kaepernick and everybody else is kneeling for the anthem has the right to kneel for the anthem it's America you get to do what you want but the idea that we should stop playing the anthem at all too so as not to offend the delicate sensibilities and people who don't like the flag what a bunch of horse manure really silly stuff okay other the other politicized topic of the week it's all been Kaepernick all the time over at ESPN I mean it's amazing how many people seem to care deeply about a second string quarterback who absolutely blows at his job for the last two years but Steven Naismith says that Charlottesville should get Kaepernick a job it's amazing how the outcome is always Kaepernick should have a job and it's like car crash in in Louisiana Kaepernick should get a job storm clouds roll over Texas Kaepernick should get a job doesn't matter what a is B is always Kaepernick should get a job here's Steven a note saying Charlottesville should be the reason Kaepernick gets a job or something for no reason whatever now in light of what occurred this weekend in Charlottesville Steve Nate will this change opinions on Colin well first of all it should I think to some degree it has and I want to state for the record that damn sure had better change the opinions of owners within the National Football League quick fast and then a hurry not just quick not just fast but quick fast and in a hurry also expediently speedily as fast as their little legs could carry them okay why what does Charlotte still have to do with Colin Kaepernick let's Colin Kaepernick there did I miss it what a child is that what well it to suggest that the NFL owners are like Richard Spencer is just insane it's just insane you have any evidence of that whatsoever there Bob Kraft is like Richard Spencer what absolute nonsense but again the sort of politicization drives people to the all right okay drives people to the extremes whenever you have politicization of what our common topics it drives people insane and transcends the extremes of politics it's a bad thing we should have social fabric or we can come together the national anthem seems like one place we should be able to come together watching football games seems like another place we should come together if even these last tiny and almost insignificant vestiges of commonality are ripped away from us and it's pretty clear that that we are going to be irrevocably torn in the near future okay we'll be back here tomorrow with more updates on all the latest on ben shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
