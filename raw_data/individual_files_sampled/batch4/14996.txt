there was another article again in the National Post how disappointing and it was about how they're concerned that anxiety around climate change is causing suicide and you know people will say to me Sheila no no no global warming cultists are not a doomsday cult but it is absolutely a doomsday cult if you're going to kill yourself because there's some sort of impending apocalypse and the article goes on to say that heat has effects on mental health which leads me to believe that maybe they have the thermostat up a little too high in the National post office yes well it you know it is really tragic how this has gotten completely out of hand we found a few years ago that the Alberta Teachers science journal had issued an article wherein one of the teachers was advocating that his colleagues use the climate fright movie The Day After Tomorrow as a way to critique climate science and that's one of the most terrifying movies you'll ever see on climate and for an age group will say kids 13 to 15 it's terrifying it's about you know parental abandonment separation in the face of a crisis killer crisis and how can you send your kid home with that and say you know critique this based on climate change it's a movie and it's not scientifically based and it's it's horrible to put that in any kid's head and that's what's happening we just had someone write us the other day they said the Calgary their grade 7 student came home with some wildfire pouring you know wildfire climate corn infest books where this is the future well you know if you burn a forest down it's not gonna burn again for quite a few years so many of these things are quite ridiculous and these kinds of notions being put in people's head as they grow up feeling this burden of responsibility to save the planet you know but I'm a kid can't even tie up my shoelaces get to university and you realize wow all these problems are some big and complex maybe I should just get rid of myself because I'm in the way I mean there's a guy in the states named voice Granton he is a university professor and author and he wrote an article saying that when his baby girl was born he cried twice once because she was so beautiful and twice because she was doomed and he went on the article to say that you know it's better not to have children and maybe even better to kill yourself like this is a horrible thing you know to save the planet how could he even write that in an article about his daughter she's gonna grow up one day and read that so you know people are taking this like way way way too seriously that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
