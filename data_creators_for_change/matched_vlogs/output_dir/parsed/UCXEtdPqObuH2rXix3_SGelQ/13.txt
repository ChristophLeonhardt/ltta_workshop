hey Kara why'd you look so depressed
maybe that's because I am and you're
about to see why because I just drank my
entire bank account filming this video I
need to seek help
hi my name is Kara and I have a spending
problem I'm not the guy you for I was
hey Morgan oh hi baby

you're gonna love this I like your
t-shirt okay yeah but you look so cute
this is the same place I wore to school
I would have had school boy Morgan
it is sixty-five pounds but I'm pretty
sure real building in their suits cost
upwards of many thousands over a million
we don't have a million pounds for the
record I went to blow up my nose and a
big snowball you dripped down my face so
I had no other option than to pick it up
and then it was this dress is amazing
but you know what it's still amazing him
read it has been discovered Wow I think
Morgan looks the cutest he's probably
ever looked in his life this is so
adorable
because this is literally you know you
were fat at school no next up we are
going somewhere kind of insane for
dinner now and I'm really really really
excited for this you're excited I'm
scared because our mom that has to pay

or something ago and the bill was it was
like five hundred pounds so this is
literally it's literally looking like a
billion this is ID we will they're on
the same side is it you can see it okay

and this possibly the most expensive
restaurant in the whole of London is
where we are going for dinner tonight in
the shard in London which is basically
just this big pointy piece of glass in
the sky it's really cool you can
literally see everything from it
I don't know when me over that market
even though I different I'm excited it's
going to be really expensive you
prepared to pay whoa

rice and exploring
type of toilet and then some noodles

best way possible
I'm over hips and Chris Phoebe if it's
so good it's worth the money we're
probably a couple of hundred into the
snow already but it's great and he just
stepped on my really
one eternity later billionaires kind of
expensive sips tea well as you can't see

over there thank you I am putting in the
address of our hotel I'm confirming the
pickup and then rolling right over to
her locks well that's a lot of money you

really care I'm just using this video to
justify my usual reckless spending yeah
okay you get overlooked since everywhere
don't try that like this is worn off for
the video as you can see guys the
expensive car has been spotted in the
distance here's Keira and a natural
habitat she's just she struggling to
walk a little bit but she's just spent
so much money on oh the car is the car
is going away hello mr. Clark mr. Karno
he's waving at us it's Kara she's
entering the car it's a lot of money she
doesn't know what's gonna happen ahead
here she comes
into the car she's opening the handle
here she goes she's speaking to the
driver of the expensive car
I'm not going round because I need to go
to the other side I'll open the handle
as you can see Kara's here
she's telling me to turn the camera off
because I'm being embarrassing so by
this makes it all at the attention span
it's a three-year-old - goldfish so
things like this really pleased me I
will not be drinking that the very nice
gesture good guys I was really kind of
insane you know I mean like I'm outside
the box was actually really cool the guy

door for me I mean like thanks and then
he even said that I had a really pretty
dress on it's nice not kill the guy I
have dairy look at you we are back at
the hotel room now that we were earlier
but I haven't given you a proper tour
around it yet hi Wow
so now we see what the new billionaire
has been spending all the money on look
at this bad boy gonna give us all a
little tool yeah okay so in this room
there are so many chairs that there's
space for at least four people to solve
it for it's a bit extreme maybe it may
be for skinny people to fuck people like
me this is the first time you've sat on
these isn't that the most expensive trip
ever
I don't really know what else to show
you the room it's actually kind of
boring but look it has a boat oh I see
yeah yes a part of the experience is you
get to sit here and look at that super
infested River we're definitely gonna
get polio if you drink from that and
watch the boats go by
did you know they found a whale in that
river the other day fun fact well crazy
life we're living whales are expensive I
then went out and I poached it and then
I sold its blob were on the black market
and that's how I have my billions
someone's gonna call Peter let's go into
the other room
Wow oh you bit tired
did the tour drain you a little bit
oh thanks I'm having a bit of a
technical difficulty the door handle we
shouldn't be filming this who really
should be like figuring out how to get
out there's a lot so I kinda just shove
it in oh my good oh yeah I'm suing oh my
god way oh my holy sugar what was just
took such a dark turn
oh my god what do we do well this sounds
like five new power and the dawn before
billionaire love why should we finish
the door and then try and find a way
okay
coming into the bathroom ooh what's in
here oh it's a shower and it's a big boy
down here we have the toilet oh it's a
over here we've got the towel owner wait
the towels roll on the floor and then
over here in the bath for you
hi dude this box is so big of course
oh good
oh my papi and we'll even 24 hours look
to hotel room stops now we're supposed
to check out like an hour
free for what team you're really hello
and we are staying in the river bank
what one is it the Suites one like a
living room there's like a bedroom and
the Hat the door handle to the bedroom
has fallen off and we can't get out and
there's no phone in the bedroom to call
the reception
yeah the handle is falling off the door
yeah and with stuck in the room thank
you
okay so wait now we can't get in trouble
for being an hour and 15 minutes over
checkout time yeah we can't I mean no
one eternity later hi we're trapped in
here
so you guys the chauffeur canceled on us
so we have been subjected to getting
public transport how disgusting and
because you think you actually hate this
so luckily they have first class on this
train
what does you remember they say yeah
it's completely unnecessary that's not
really any difference at all but I'm not
profiting off this video am I so we are
on our way to Sheffield currently which
doesn't really sound like the most
billionaire place in the world good but
since Morgan is a local to Sheffield
also the most of guys have senior time
the best thing to come on Sheffield ever
since Gary Cahill and since Morgan is in
fact a billionaire of Sheffield he's
gonna show me the top of billionaire
locations in Sheffield or me and do some
more expensive things
watch me during my bank account and do
unnecessary things for fun later so
since I was subjected to get public
transport with all the peasants I was
really gonna take this out of context
and do a hate video on me aren't there
yep that's how they usually do so
chauffeur Jill has just karma to pick us
up I was super excited to get in the big
fancy Range Rover Range Rover Range
Rover how much was it marks forty five
thousand I think because it's got all
the extras on it it's blowing this
biggish stuff that's just pocket change
to me
Oh Cara no I can't see anywhere maybe
you should ring up Joe
Oh Joe hi we're at the station we're
here says she's in the car so Wow
this clearly No why'd you hang up on
jail you can't hang up on my mother why
did you do that why come with you why
what we doing a white wait what do you
mean go Kara seriously why are you
taking this why are you taking me the
car is it here Kara are you sure we go
to the right direction
wait are you are you get it's a Ford why
she got bored
she shouldn't we just got in for repair
oh this is pretty cool right
I think it's pretty snazzy
you know I guess polar bear skin is
probably very expensive it's endangered
so you've locked much your house yeah
you know what for all the slack care was
given it this car is actually really not
what screw this car
kara let's go flipping tourney wheel
billionaire in this Jail this is your
fault we are going to McDonald's
drive-through right now and I had the
wonderful idea of buying the most
expensive thing on the McDonald's menu

cheeseburger yeah probably
I'm gonna like vegetables and okay
she made oh oh six Paula's a lot how
about you just yet how about you just
get like 10 hamburgers and make sure we
get free signature French no get like
loads and if burgers are make our own

Collection burgers and we can taste
tests the most expensive burgers on the
McDonald's menu guys I have no clue

pound foods I'm gonna be drinking well

you'll just be analogy you be good okay
thanks I hate billionaire Cara no but
you can use pretending to makes me feel
better

the McDonald's menu and in true
billionaire style I really don't think
