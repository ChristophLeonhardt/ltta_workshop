across South Korea people were watching the historic summit closely some were overwhelmed by the images the first time they'd seen a North Korean leader step foot in their country the declaration that was signed was a declaration of intent nothing has actually changed yet but it could mean a very different political future for the next generation of Koreans while South Korea had wall-to-wall coverage of the events in North Korea on state-controlled media a more edited version was presented people here have not yet been told of the possibility of the next meeting being between their leader and president Trump experts say one of the people closest to Kim is likely to be involved in changing the official narrative well for North Korea the all of the the media are controlled by the propaganda and agitation department which kim yo-jong Kim jong-un's younger sister and we saw you know companying him she also came here you know to the Olympic Games she works in that department which indicates it's a very very high priority for the North Korean regime during the summit president moon jae-in and supreme leader kim jong-un met alone face-to-face for over 30 minutes Trump is also said to favor meeting one-on-one with no aides a former senior official who worked on North Korea both at the White House and later at the UN has this advice for the US president establishing a good personal relationship that would then lay the groundwork for real detailed talks among experts I think is the best way to go and this could be a very highly successful meeting they've done the right way after the very high-profile summit the next stage of the diplomatic process will take place well away from the spotlight the lines of communication between Pyongyang Seoul and Washington will remain open as they discuss the substance and venue of a possible trump Kim summit James BAE's al Jazeera Seoul
