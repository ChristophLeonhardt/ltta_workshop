1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:05,609
When politicians talk about workers, they
tend to focus on certain types of jobs.

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,910
“Bernie Sanders stood American workers.”

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,139
“It’s American workers that remake this
country”

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:15,410
But in the US, retail workers have outnumbered
manufacturing workers since 2002.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,500
And food service workers aren’t far behind.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,910
These jobs are in every community - they’re
the base of the service economy.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,080
So with the recession in the rear-view mirror,
it’s worth asking: can these jobs be good

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,160
What do we want?

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,840
Contract!

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,960
When do we want it?

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,480
Now!

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,600
These Kroger workers are rallying outside
a grocery store in West Virginia because their

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,329
employer wouldn’t meet their demands, stalling
negotiations for a new union contract.

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,780
“It’s not like we’re asking for the
sun, the moon and the stars.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:59,489
We want a modest living wage and we want the
maintenance of our medical benefits.”

16
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,150
Kroger eventually agreed to a new 3-year contract
for over 4,000 workers.

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,340
It includes pay raises and zero cuts to their
benefits.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,049
By negotiating collectively, service workers
can secure an hourly wage that is six dollars

19
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,310
higher on average than nonunion wages.

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,189
But they are a small minority.

21
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,680
Private sector union membership in the US
has fallen to 6.4% of all workers.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,450
It’s even lower in the retail and food service
industries.

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,219
The decline of unions in the US was caused
in part by larger trends that have shifted

24
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,600
the types of jobs available, especially for
those without a college degree.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,249
During the 80s, 90s and 2000s, several occupations
that used to provide a stable middle-class

26
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:47,909
income grew more slowly than both higher-wage
and lower-wage jobs.

27
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,380
That’s partly due to new technologies: robots
in factories, computer software in offices.

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,220
“The decline in the middle has been steep.

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,679
A lot of that has been growth at the top,
which is good.

30
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:05,359
People have moved out of the middle and into
professional, technical and managerial jobs.

31
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,960
But, the bottom section of the labor market,
which comprises maybe 17-18 percentage of

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,121
jobs, is about a third larger than it was
in 1980.

33
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:19,849
And if you look just among people without
a college degree it's much larger still.

34
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,739
And that's the group we should be concerned
about.”

35
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,980
The great recession intensified those longer-term
trends.

36
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,280
Since 2010, the economy has added millions
of jobs, but not evenly.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,570
The biggest area of growth was in high-skill
occupations, mostly for people with 4-year

38
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,989
college degrees.

39
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,069
Meanwhile workers with a high school diploma
were pushed out of middle-skill occupations.

40
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:44,650
And in low-skill jobs, they’re increasingly
competing with those who have some college.

41
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,220
“We're adding lots of jobs.

42
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,849
The concern is that, many of the jobs that
are being added are not good jobs, in terms

43
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,790
of offering a reasonable standard of living
and job security.

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,299
And many of the good jobs that are being added
are not accessible to typical workers.”

45
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:08,980
“Thank you for joining us today to discuss
the importance of predictable schedules and

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,439
incomes for workers.”

47
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,840
“Hello my name is Kingia Phillips.

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,700
I am a former worker at South Philadelphia
Walmart.”

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,049
“The juice pallets were the most hard to
do.

50
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:31,069
And when you’re pregnant, you’re not supposed
to lift above your head, but I had to.”

51
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,599
Kingia came to DC to speak in favor of a federal
bill that would regulate work schedules for

52
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,920
retail, with the aim of increasing stability
in hours and income.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,409
“After I had the baby I asked them could
I have my schedule adjusted, a tiny bit.

54
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:50,620
And they told me that we all have kids and
they have a job to do, a company to run.

55
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,760
And it turned out that they cut my schedule
down to 8 hours a week.”

56
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
“I was doing 32 hours.”

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,030
It’s a common complaint among part time
retail workers: that to get enough hours you

58
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,659
have to be available to work at any time the
store is open, which is especially hard for

59
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,540
parents, students, and people with a second
job.

60
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,500
So after a month, Kingia quit.

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,109
“I knew they were just going to tell me
to re-open my availability, and that would

62
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:21,860
be the only way for me to make more money
and be able to sustain myself and my child.”

63
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,100
The federal proposal faces an uphill battle
in a Republican congress, but since 2014,

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,790
six cities and the state of Oregon have passed
scheduling policies.

65
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,950
The details vary from place to place but most
of them apply to fast food and retail workers,

66
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,570
they require two weeks advance notice of work
schedules, with extra pay for subsequent changes

67
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,490
that are initiated by the company.

68
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,160
Most of the measures also require employers
to offer hours to existing employees before

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
hiring more people.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,230
“So what it does is, a lot of these policies
start to balance out the burden of doing business,

71
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,850
so that the people who are getting who are
getting paid the lowest aren't the only ones

72
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,350
bearing the cost.”

73
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,760
Policymakers have also moved to increase the
minimum wage and require paid sick leave in

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,430
certain cities and states.

75
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,000
It’s a response to the fact that not only
are middle-class jobs moving out of reach

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,130
for non-college workers, but a lot the remaining
jobs have also gotten worse since the recession

77
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,130
hit.

78
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,450
“In 2005, you could walk into a JC Penney,
and it was a stable workforce.

79
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,310
People had full-time hours, and health insurance,
and even commission.

80
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,940
It was a workforce that knew each other, and
felt like they could make their job better.

81
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,610
By 2008, that workforce was completely contingent.

82
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,000
People's hours were changing from one week
to the next.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,610
Nobody knew each other.”

84
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,870
The number of involuntary part time workers
-- those are people working part time who

85
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,990
would prefer full-time work -- that jumped
up during the recession.

86
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,430
And the increase was greater for both the
retail sector and for leisure and hospitality,

87
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,610
which includes restaurants and hotels.

88
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,220
This is part of a much broader trend.

89
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,670
A 2016 study found a significant rise in “alternative
work arrangements” across the economy.

90
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,240
That includes temp workers, contract firm
workers and freelancers.

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,960
And it makes sense: Salaried and full-time
workers are fixed costs for employers.

92
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,440
Whether revenue is up or down, you have to
pay them and fund their benefits.

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,760
But if you have a pool of more flexible workers
whose hours you can dial up and down to match

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,170
your sales, you can save money, at least in
the short term.

95
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,470
Those cost-cutting strategies have been enabled
by new technologies.

96
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,560
“Today, a lot of big employers are using
workforce scheduling technologies, and so

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
it's an algorithm that's setting the schedule.

98
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,831
And when you do an analysis of when the peak
hours are, it's easier to slot people in for

99
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:43,590
four hour shifts and then rotate it out.

100
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,610
But there's very few companies have systems
that basically say, ‘My goal is to try to

101
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,700
give people some stability in their hours
from one week to the next, and I'm gonna try

102
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,110
to match people's schedules from one week
to the next.’"

103
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,070
What this has meant for some workers is schedules
and paychecks that change from week to week.

104
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,640
A gallup poll of hourly workers with varying
hours found that one out of three said their

105
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,960
schedules cause them financial hardship.

106
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,640
“Instead of giving me two 8 hour shifts
and a 4 hour shift, they would give me 5 4-hour

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
shifts.

108
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,370
So I would have to go to school and go to
work 5 times a week, instead of working 3

109
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,560
days a week.”

110
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,420
“The amount of hours they give out is based
on sales, which I believe is horrible.

111
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,770
One week I’ll have 13 hours, the next i’ll
have 25, the next I’ll have 30, then back

112
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,200
down to 15.

113
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,470
And that — that shows on my paycheck.”

114
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,610
Target and Walmart already post schedules
at least a week and a half in advance.

115
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,390
Both companies have also raised their minimum
wages in recent years.

116
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,720
And several retailers have announced an end
to the  controversial practice of on-call

117
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
scheduling.

118
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,360
“On-call shifts require employees to call
employers the day before or the day of the

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,240
potential shift to find out if they’ll be
needed to work.

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,900
If employees aren’t needed, they don’t
get paid.”

121
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,170
But they’re a long way from a model like
Costco’s which guarantees a minimum amount

122
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:13,190
of weekly hours for both full and part- time
workers.

123
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,970
The union model for including workers’ input
in business decisions has not really moved

124
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,990
with the economy into these low-wage service
jobs.

125
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,750
And it hasn’t been replaced with something
else.

126
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,830
So if workers feel like they can’t find
a voice at their jobs, they’ll likely keep

127
00:08:27,830 --> 00:00:00,000
looking for one in the law.
