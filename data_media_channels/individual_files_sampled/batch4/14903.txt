a British Member of Parliament has stood up in the House of Commons and announced that she's on her period nope I'm not kidding so I saw this video yesterday from the House of Commons and I thought I'd seen everything in the Commons frankly but not this an MP called Daniel Rowley told the house that she's on her period this week and used it as an opportunity to segue into this pop period poverty talking point about how women it's unfair that women should have to pay more for sanitary products just for being women's to take a quick look at this thank you I would like to turn in to you today and to the house and perhaps we'll excuse me for my lateness that today I'm on my period and it cost me this week already 25 pound we know the average cost of a period in the UK over a year's 500 pounds many women can't afford this what is a minister doing to address pity poverty see she said it she actually said it in the mother of all Parliament stood up and announced that she's on a period I thought I'd seen everything but evidently not but she's talking about an issue here that hard left feminists have been using for a while and they call it period poverty and it simply means that women well entitled women don't want to have to pay for their sanitary products forgetting the fact that simply being alive and being an adult comes with costs it's not free to live unless you want to go and live in the Lake District as a feral person things are gonna cost money the only things in life really you can guarantee as free of the air in the sunlight and if you're from the north like me you don't even get that much Sun for your money so being alive comes with costs and if we're going to talk about toiletries for instance why don't we talk about the fact that men use toiletries - we don't have a period but we do have a face that needs to be shaved every day most men have to do it so you've got the cost of the razor and you need a decent razor so you don't tear up your face in the process you need good shaving cream to ensure that you're actually getting a smooth shave and you need an aftershave balm to ensure that your face doesn't go bright red afterwards trace doesn't go bright red cause I mean it's the first thing that people see when you're working in a professional environment let's be honest ladies you can get away with not shaving your legs for a few days just put on a pair of tights and can't rock out like that got the conquers out covering our faces up but then this close this close as well when they spend a lot of money on clothes but let's be honest about that choice men when we need suits suits aren't cheap good shirts aren't cheap good shoes aren't cheap and if we want to live as an adult in a professional environment it costs money and I don't see men asking for the government to pay for their expensive brogues and by the way I'm not gonna pay for Daniel Rory's sanitary products because that's what she's saying when they say they want it for free what they mean is they want everyone to pay into the system with taxes and then for sanitary products to be divvied up across the country and what are they going to be getting the very very best sanitary products all round I don't want to pay for that and I'm told by my female friends onkled Authority that Powell and sells sanitary towels I mean come on it's not that complicated is it but if they're gonna be pedantic and if they're gonna be Petty and silly about this then I'm gonna get pedantic as well because I can talk about men's toiletries and men's clothes and be vague about it or we can actually look at the numbers let's look at the numbers on food cost shall we because men have to eat on average 2500 calories per day but women are only advised to eat 2,000 institutional racism who knows maybe it's biological racism but when you compare that difference in 500 calories every single day you get an annual total of a hundred and eighty two thousand five hundred extra calories per year okay let's extrapolate that that means that that's an extra 91 days of food consumption of food intake compared to women 91 days so 91 days 3 meals that means men have to eat 273 or meals than women every year that doesn't come cheap that doesn't come free that means we're paying out more for food so if we're gonna get pedantic maybe it's time that men start asking for the government to pay for our break first it's silly this is how silly this argument is men and women face different costs we this can go on forever we can talk about the difference in price between socks and tights the difference in price between period pads and men's boxers you know there are differences in costs and it's unfortunate it really is unfortunate that some girls struggle to pay I find that it saddens me that's one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Briggs is because I want to see British jobs come home back to British people I want to see the economy boosted and I know Theresa May claims that unemployment is lower than ever battery under employment is higher than ever so we do have an issue with poverty I instead of just handing out free panty pads I think it's time we start looking at the sources of these problems and the government took action to solve economic unfairness frankly on the British people so Daniel Rowley until all these feminists I think it's about time they started talking about the rights of women in this country to have jobs in this country with companies from this country is it not better to talk about improving the standard of living across the board across the UK rather than telling people that they should have to pay into a system that gives everybody free sanitary towels if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team be sure to download the brand new app from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
