Russia's military might grabbed international attention this week after President Putin unveiled the country's new arsenal of nuclear weapons the media is now speculating that there'll be a new arms race between Moscow and Washington but the numbers show a different picture as Marant gas jeff explains the news this week might have seemed a little apocalyptic Cold War in big bold letters arms race the pundits squeaked but then war always sells best several analysts in the West's have said this is the declaration of a new Cold War are we in a new arms race right now my point of view is the individuals who have said that new Cold War has started are not really analysts they do propaganda if you were to speak about arms race then an arms race began at exactly the time and moment when the u.s. opted out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty how odd and here I thought that surely it takes at least two to make an arms race we do not want a new Cold War or a new arms race someone's lying the money tells a completely different story the US military budgets just jumped nope wrong word surged from 640 billion to 700 billion in one year and they're proud of it arms race right on cue Russia's budget shrank well isn't that anti-climatic for a second year in a row no less the imbalance here is almost almost funny the US war budget increased in one year by more than Russia spends on its military annually the Pentagon spends 15 times more that's 1,500 percent more on its military than Moscow heck even Saudi Arabia spends more on its military than Russia and that's not even counting NATO all allies are committed to increase defense spending as a share of GDP the direction of travel is clear we have to continue to move in that direction it's a fair demand that all who benefit from the best defense in the world carry their proportionate share of the necessary cost to defend freedom these grave security concerns are the same reason that I have been very very direct with secretary Stoltenberg in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations other nations must be prepared to take responsibility and that includes more investment in defence why is NATO raising military budgets and some cases doubling them if it's closest competition is reducing spending I may have been wrong here there evidently is an arms race a one man race and you obviously don't need to for this tango
