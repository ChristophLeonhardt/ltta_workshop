27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,430
of the marketplace not necessarily

28
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,540
injecting any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of value into the</font>

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,020
online advertising value chain so the ad

markets come back how I mean what-what

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,060
verticals have come back wood industries

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,640
yeah so we're actually pretty pretty

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,259
well diversified across a number of

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,420
different verticals some some

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,710
interesting trends that we've seen

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,299
recently have been in the certainly

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">automotive and financial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font>

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,340
sectors but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not concentrating on</font>

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,740
any one individual vertical where Laura

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,659
spray our automotive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> finance back to</font>

41
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,610
levels they were a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year ago or is it</font>

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're not going to chaos</font>

43
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,500
anymore um well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can only</font>

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,090
speak on behalf of what we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,920
because we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a strong growth</font>

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
trajectory we are penetrating new

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,869
accounts and growing our business within

48
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,390
key advertisers within<font color="#E5E5E5"> each major</font>

49
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,729
vertical so the business that's coming
