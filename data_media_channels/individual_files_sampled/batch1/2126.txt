people often talk about positive thinking and to me positive thinking is a lie if a sportsman says it's going in it's going in it's going in it doesn't always definitely go in and then the flip side of that is something called negative thinking which we all know about and negative thinking is also a lie because if you say you're gonna miss or you're not going to get the deal or you won't get the job then sometimes that's not true also here's the sticker for most people when the result isn't the result that they want they get stuck in what I call the loop of insanity the result wasn't what they wanted and they blame something or somebody or an action or their boss or the deal there's a mindset which is possible is it possible this could come off or when you've got possible it gives you something called clarity you don't go to the supermarket with a shopping list of everything you don't want you go to the supermarket with a list of what you want that's clarity when you commit to dealing with anything in advance then you can ask yourself is it possible the next deal could come off is it possible I could get in a team is it possible I could make this happen and then you go through the whole cycle again possible clarity take action get a result commit to dealing with whatever the game throws
