immigration officials continue to deport individuals who have been in the country for decades and have not committed a crime the recent case that has made national headlines involves a Palestinian man who has actually been in the United States for nearly 40 years and he was not only someone who is here for a long period of time he was also a small business owner who had employed several people in the state of Ohio and he also had a wife and daughters who were US citizens or are US citizens but it didn't matter the ice officials who made the decision to deport him even went so far as to ignoring an order from eight from the Judiciary Committee in Congress that urged them to allow him to stay so they can actually investigate the situation so now let me give you the details his name is Omar Othman Adi and again he has been here for nearly 40 years 39 to be specific Immigration and Customs Enforcement had kept him in detention for two weeks ignoring a House Judiciary Committee request that the Department of Homeland Security review his case which would have allowed him to temporarily remain in the u.s. so he would have temporarily remained in the US for about six months while his case gets investigated and the reason why his case needed to be investigated was because there was an accusation that his previous marriage was a fraud just so he can get her green card now his ex-wife came out and said no I was coerced into my initial statement but our marriage was not a fraud and he was in a relationship with me and he's never committed any crimes this needs to be investigated he should stay here in the United States but it doesn't matter ice officials decided to deport him anyway now according to representative Tim Ryan who has been home the warpath in regard to this particular case he said that a mayor was a pillar of the community and brought commerce to a downtown that craved investment he hired members of our community he paid taxes he did everything right there are violent criminal walking the streets yet our government wasted our precious resources incarcerated him great statement by congressman Tim Ryan appreciate his hard work on this issue and I think a lot of people in Ohio do so saying nearly the manner in which ice enforces is also deeply troubling so he was going to check in with ice and now this is a story we've heard so many times over and over again he's through his regular check-ins he thinks everything is fine and then all of a sudden they spring this on him and they say okay now we're gonna kick you out of the country so make plans to to leave okay so he's like wow it's terrible and but he's a law-abiding citizen Isis told him this he makes plans to to to to leave he and his wife his current wife they sold their home they sold their home and bought tickets to fly to Jordan which is where he was born and then ice got back to him and said I don't know wait a minute no actually you're gonna be fine this might be investigated you don't have to leave he goes in for a second check in with ice officials and then they detain him yeah the first one that that was problematic there was many but the one that we were telling you about they strapped an ankle bracelet on him said we're gonna kick her out of the country then they bring him back in at a later time go no just kidding we weren't we're not gonna do that everything's gonna be fine next time he comes in they arrest them and they put him in jail for two weeks but look he was already following your orders he that was already appeared to be the worst case scenario but leave it to the Trump administration take a worst-case scenario and make it even worse by needlessly keeping him in jail and detention for several weeks before then moving him to Chicago and then getting him on a flight to Amman Jordan and with barely an ability to say goodbye to his family here in America is this who we are unfortunately with Trump in charge yes uprooting families destroying businesses all in the name of politics and demagoguery that's what he's turned America into and it's our taxpayer money going toward deporting people like a mayor okay this this notion that they're only going after these dangerous criminals and as Trump put it during his State of the Union these ms-13 gang members yeah everyone wants the ms-13 gang members gone everyone wants real criminals out of the country there's no question about that everyone's in agreement but there's no reason why a man who's been in the country for forty years is a job creator hasn't done anything wrong there's no reason why we should be deporting him spending our resources and our time to you know tear his family apart and destroy his business you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show come join us and become a member tea white tea network.com slash join
