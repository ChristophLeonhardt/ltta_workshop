SECURITY IS NOT JUST ABOUT
DOLLARS EXTENDED.
>> Shannon: RICH EDSON,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE PRESIDENT AGAIN FOCUSING ON
MS-13 TODAY IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT
ROUNDTABLE ON LONG ISLAND WHEN
HE CLAIMED THE U.S. IMMIGRATION
LAWS LEAVING HOLLAND TO BE
DESIRED.
>> President Trump: CRIPPLING
LOOPHOLES IN OUR LAWS HAVE
ENABLED MS-13 GANG MEMBERS AND
OTHER CRIMINALS TO INFILTRATE
OUR COMMUNITIES.
>> Shannon: CONGRESSMAN PETER
KING FROM NEW YORK WAS SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT
DURING THE ROUND TABLE AND HE
JOINS US NOW.
WE SAW YOU, SIR.
THANKS FOR MAKING TIME TO JOIN
US.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT
THAT THE LEFTIST THING TODAY
THAT THIS IS BASICALLY
FEARMONGERING ON THE
PRESIDENT PART.
THEY SAY TRUMP HAS USED LOOMING
FEARS OF MS-13 VIOLENCE AND
A FLAGRANTLY RACIST IMMIGRATION
PLATFORM, ONE THAT PREDOMINATELY
TARGETS PEOPLE OF COLOR SUCH AS
IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE FROM MUSLIM
MAJORITY COUNTRIES AND CONFLATES
IMMIGRANTS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME.
>> OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY OR
THEY ARE.
THE PEOPLE BEING HURT THE MOST
BY MS-13 ARE ENTIRELY THE
HISPANIC UNITY IN THE IMMIGRANT
DIVINITY.
THERE ARE NO WHITE MIDDLE-CLASS
PEOPLE BEING KILLED BY MS-13.
THEY ARE GOING AFTER PEOPLE IN
THE HISPANIC UNITY AND THE
CRIMES THEY COMMIT, CUTTING OFF
THEIR FACES, CUTTING OFF
FINGERS, CUTTING OUT PEOPLE'S
HEARTS.
DECAPITATING PEOPLE.
YOUNG PEOPLE BEING KILLED OFTEN
BY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE.
THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN
TERRORIZED BY MS-13.
EVERYONE, LEFT AND RIGHT,
REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, WHATEVER
SHOULD BE THANKING
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WHAT HE'S
DOING.
YOU CAN DISAGREE ON OTHER ISSUES
BUT ON THIS ONE, GOING AFTER
MS-13
MS-13 IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.
THE PARENTS OF THOSE YOUNG
PEOPLE MURDERED, THEY WERE THERE
TODAY MAY FULLY SUPPORTED WHAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT TWO OF
THE PARENTS HAD THESE PEOPLE ARE
ANIMALS.
>> Shannon: YOU'VE HAD A CLOSE
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS
BECAUSE THEY'RE BEEN A COUPLE
DOZEN MURDERS IN THE LONG ISLAND
AREA OVER THE LAST PLAYERS.
ATTRIBUTED TO MESSAGING.
WHEN YOU READ THE DETAILS OF
THESE CRIMES COMMITS NOT A
PARTISAN ISSUE.
THERE IS NOTHING POLITICAL ABOUT
IT.
I HAD TO STOP READING THEM
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HORRIFIC
THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE
HERE DOING HARM TO INNOCENT
INDIVIDUALS.
IS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN COME TO
A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION?
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT
LOOPHOLES TODAY.
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
TALKED ABOUT LOOPHOLES TODAY.
IS THERE ENOUGH, AT LEAST AT
THIS POINT, MOTIVATION ON
CAPITOL HILL TO GET SOMETHING
DONE?
TO GO OUR WHATEVER
PRESIDENT TRUMP OPPOSES,
DEMOCRATS SEEM IN LOCKSTEP TO AT
DEMOCRATS SEEM IN LOCKSTEP TO AC
DEMOCRATS SEEM IN LOCKSTEP TO AK
HIM, THEY SAY NO.
BY HAVING HIS HEARING TODAY, THE
MEETING TODAY, IT DRIVES HOME TO
THE PUBLIC HOW EVIL THESE PEOPLE
ARE.
THAT COULD CAUSE ENOUGH
DEMOCRATS TO REALIZE IT'S TIME
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
THEY CAN ARGUE WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON A MILLION
OTHER ISSUES BUT THIS SHOULD NOT
BE IN ANY WAY A PARTISAN ISSUE.
IT'S A HUMAN ISSUE, AN AMERICAN
ISSUE.
THANK GOD FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR
WHAT HE'S DOING TODAY.
IF YOU, IF OTHERS COULD HAVE
SEEN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM TODAY.
I AM SURE VERY FEW OF THEM ARE
REGISTERED REPUBLICANS BUT THEY
WERE CHEERING FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP OR WHAT HE WAS
DOING.
THEY WANT THE POLICE TO BE DOING
MORE.
THE POLICE ARE DOING A GREAT
JOB.
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT POLICE
BRUTALITY AND PEOPLE BEING
ARRESTED, THOSE PEOPLE TODAY,
THEY WANT THE POLICE TO BE MORE
AGGRESSIVE.
>> Shannon: SOMETHING THAT HAS
BEEN PARTISAN IN NATURE AND
TOMORROW WILL BE BIPARTISAN IS
THE MEETING THAT INVOLVES THE
DOJ AND LAWMAKERS.
WE KNOW THE SECOND MEETING IS
GOING TO BE BIPARTISAN.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE, YOU ARE A
MEMBER.
WHAT YOU HOPE WILL BE REVEALED
TOMORROW?
>> IF TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.
ENUNCIATION STARTED?
WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF THE FISA
APPLICATIONS?
WHEN DID THE FBI FIRST LEARN, AS
THEY CLAIM NOW, THAT SOMETHING
WAS GOING WRONG.
I'VE EXAMINED EVERYTHING I
POSSIBLY CAN.
I SEE NO EVIDENCE OF ANY
COLLUSION ANYWHERE.
I DON'T SEE ANY BASIS FOR THIS
INVESTIGATION BEING STARTED.
MAYBE THE FBI AND JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT HAVE SOMETHING TO
SHOW THE GANG OF EIGHT TOMORROW.
HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW THEM BUT
IT HASN'T BEEN THERE.
THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO
EITHER BLOCK IT CAN MAKE IT
DIFFICULT.
FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OR
WHAT HAPPENED OR WHAT CAUSED
THEM TO START THIS
INVESTIGATION.
IT WASN'T JUST A POLITICAL HIT
JOB.
WAS IT PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR
OWN SILO?
I HAVEN'T PRACTICED LAW IN A
WHILE BUT I'LL SEE ANY BASIS
HERE FOR THE INVESTIGATION EVEN
BEING STARTED.
NEVER MIND GOING ON THERE FOR A
YEAR AND HALF.
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK IS
HELPFUL DEMOCRATS WILL BE
INCLUDED IN THE SECOND MEETING?
DOES IT DEFUSE THE PARTISANSHIP?
>> YOU WOULD HOPE SO BUT THE
FACT IS DEMOCRATS COULD'VE BEEN
ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION ALL
ALONG.
IT WAS DEVIN NUNES AND TREY
GOWDY THAT HAD TO DEMAND THIS
INFORMATION.
IF THE DEMOCRATS WERE SO
INTERESTED IN GETTING
INFORMATION TO BUT THEY COULD'VE
BEEN ASKING FOR IT ALL ALONG.
INSTEAD THEY HAVE BEEN PART OF
THE DENIAL PROCESS.
EVERY TIME DEVIN NUNES ASKED FOR
SOMETHING, HE GETS ATTACKED BY
THE DEMOCRATS.
THEY COULD HAVE JOINED IN THE
APPLICATION.
THEY COULD HAVE JOINED IN THE
SUBPOENA.
THEY DIDN'T.
NOW THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE
SHOW.
>> Shannon: CHAIRMAN GOWDY
SAYS HE HOPES PEOPLE SHOW UP
WITH OPEN MINDS AND CLOSE LIPS
BECAUSE WE KNOW LEAKS OFTEN COME
FROM THESE.
WE WILL WAIT TO SEE WHAT WE DO
