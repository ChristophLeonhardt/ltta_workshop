Male fiddler crabs are lopsided.
Females have two claws
of about the same size.
Males have one regular size
claw and one outsized claw,
really outsized.
“The other is huge, it's greatly
enlarged to the point
that it can be approximately
half of his body weight.”
They use the large claw for
fighting, communicating
and courtship.
That little mud-colored crab
getting all the attention,
that’s the female.
Yes, females do prefer
males with larger claws.
But they also care
about how males
wave those big
claws when they’re
trying to attract mates.
They prefer faster waving,
probably because it indicates
a more fit potential mate.
That was shown very clearly
in an earlier experiment
when a robot claw left living
crabs struggling to keep up.
But as scientists in Australia
found out in a new experiment,
also using robot
claws, females prefer
males that accelerate
their waving when
they see a female approach.
“So we had robot replica
males that we could then
program to either escalate,
as if they are increasing
their signaling
effort, or de-escalate
as if they’re getting fatigued.”
Sure enough, faced with
a choice of robot claws,
females notice the
acceleration and preferred it.
That’s if they were
even paying attention.
To be fair, that’s not
the robot claw’s fault.
The very same thing
happens with real crabs.
Better luck next time.
