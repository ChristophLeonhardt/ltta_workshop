Sean: WE CONTINUE OUR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY, RUDY GIULIANI. I WANT TO REPORT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH. WHEN I TALK ABOUT A RIGGED INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY, AND I TALK ABOUT THE CRIMES THAT SHE COMMITTED AND I INTERVIEWED YOU ANOTHER GREAT ATTORNEYS. AND I TALKED ABOUT FISA ABUSES AND THE FISA JUDGE AND A TWO-TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW, HAVE I TELL ME, I WOULD LOVE TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU ARE RIGHT BACK IN 2015 WHEN I FIRST STARTED FOCUSING ON THAT CHART I MADE, I HAVE IT ON MY CELL PHONE. THEY ARE STILL NOT INVESTIGATED. YOU'RE NOT WRONG Sean: BUT RUSSIA COLLUSION WHAT WAS WRONG WITH DONALD TRUMP. RUSSIA COLLUSION IS FAKE NEWS RUSSIA COLLUSION IS FAKE NEW NEWS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAS BECOME THE BASIS OF THE INVESTIGATION. MUELLER OWES US A REPORT SAYING THE RUSSIA COLLUSION MEANS NOTHING, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. IT MEANS THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WAS UNNECESSARY. ALL THE REST OF IT CAME OUT OF IT WHETHER THE PERSON OR THE POLITICAL, NONE OF IT IS RELEVANT. MEANWHILE, THE MAN IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA, COME ON. AND THEY WANT ME TO GO TO HIM AND SAY LET'S TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF TO GET YOU READY FOR A DEPOSITION? Sean: THIS HAS GOTTEN PERSONAL FOR THOSE THAT ARE AFTER THE PRESIDENT. OF COURSE IT HAS COME IT'S TOTALLY PERSONAL. LOOK AT THE PRESS CORPS.
