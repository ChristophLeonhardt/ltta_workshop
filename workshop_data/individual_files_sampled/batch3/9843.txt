WILL THE TRADE WAR HAVE AN IMPACT EFFECT ON THE SECURITY RELATIONSHIP? RIGHT NOW I DON'T SEE THAT. WE'RE LOOKING FOR RECIPROCAL TRADE. ALONG THE PATH GOING THERE, CERTAINLY IT WILL BE A LITTLE ROCKY A LITTLE BUMPY AT TIMES. BUT SO FAR I DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY EFFECT IN THE SECURITY ARENA. Neil: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S THE READ FROM THE DEFENSE SECRETARY. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON AGREES. AMBASSADOR, THANKS FOR SPENDING THE TIME. IS IT YOUR SENSE TOO THIS WILL NOT BOOMERANG ON US, THE TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE ALLIES HURTING OUR SECURITY RELATIONS? YOU KNOW, NEIL, IN A GROUP OF 29 COUNTRIES, THERE ARE A LOT OF DISAGREEMENTS ON A BILATERAL BASIS. THERE'S DISAGREEMENTS WITHIN NATO ON HOW WE DO THINGS. THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT ON OUR GOAL, OUR COMMON GOAL OF A SECURITY UMBRELLA FOR ALL 29 OF US. AND I THINK THE PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATS HERE ARE VERY GOOD. THEY DO NOT BRING UP BILATERAL DISPUTES OR DISAGREEMENTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL THE OTHER AMBASSADORS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO TALK THROUGH THINGS. I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT NATO STAYING VERY UNITED AND TOGETHER. UNITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE HAVE. AND WE DO HAVE IT. Neil: SO THERE'S NO CONCERNS, EVER FOOTING THE BILL OR PUTTING THE 2% OR NATO AND DEFENSES, THAT WERE IN DOUBT A LITTLE MORE THAN 1 1/2 YEARS AGO? I THINK THAT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE IS REALLY MADE A BIG POINT AND HE'S MADE IT PUBLICLY. COUNTRIES ARE COMING THROUGH. EVERY NATO ALLY REALLY IN 2016 DID NOT INCREASE SPENDING, BUT AS OF TODAY, EVERY NATO ALLY IS INCREASING THEIR OWN DEFENSE SPENDING. IN 2018 WHEN THE NUMBERS ARE FINISHED, WE'LL HAVE THE LARGEST INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING BY OUR NATO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE COLD WAR. SO I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. EVERYONE IS TRYING HARD. THERE'S DIFFERENCES. LOOK AT ITALY. THEY'VE HAD TROUBLE FORMING A GOVERNMENT. GERMANY TOOK SEVERAL MONTHS TO FORM A GOVERNMENT AFTER ELECTIONS. WE HAVE DELAYS AND THEN YOU DON'T GET BUDGETS. SO I THINK WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE DO. WE WANT THE 2% TO REPRESENT NOT JUST A NUMBER OUT THERE, BUT THE AMOUNT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENCE AGAINST A REAL ENEMY. THAT IS WHAT IT CAME UP IN THE WALES SUMMIT, THE NUMBER WAS 2%. 2% IS NOT TOO MUCH TO PAY FOR THE SECURITY AND FREEDOM OF YOUR PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT NATO BELIEVES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN GOOD ORDER. Neil: I'M BACK TO THIS TRADE TIFF. AMERICANS DON'T SEE ANYTHING YESTERDAY OR NOR DO FARMERS. IF IT DOES, THE PRESIDENT HAS ARGUED THAT THESE ARE AS MUCH ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY EFFORTS AS THEY ARE ECONOMIC DESIRES. THAT THEY INTERTWINE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? I DO THINK THAT THE TARIFFS ARE CERTAINLY AN ISSUE. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT WE WANT IS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE WANT FAIR AND LEVEL PLAYING FIELDS. WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT E.U. COOPERATION. FORMING A NEW DEFENSE INITIATIVE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCESS TO OUTSIDE E.U. COUNTRIES TO BE ABLE TO BID ON DEFENSE PROJECTS AND NATO JUST LIKE WE ALLOW FROM THE UNITED STATES. LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SPENT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS WITH FOREIGN ALLIES BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS FOR OUR DEFENSE PURPOSES. SO WE WANT THAT SAME LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH THE E.U. COUNTRIES WHEN THEY'RE GOING OUT FOR A PROCUREMENT. WE WANT TO DO THINGS TOGETHER. WE CAN COMPETE. WE ALSO WANT THE BEST PRODUCTS FOR OUR OVERALL SECURITY. THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET. Neil: ARE YOU CONCERNED, AMBASSADOR, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS DIPLOMATICALLY AS THE LIAISON WITH NATO, BUT THIS IS COMING AT A TIME IN THIS DUST-UP WITH SOME OF OUR ALLIES AND OUR FRIENDS WHEN WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CHINESE, HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE NORTH KOREANS AND THAT WE COULD BE ALIENATING THEM AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED THEM. DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT? YOU KNOW, I THINK EVERY RELATIONSHIP HAS SO MANY FACETS AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE. FOR INSTANCE, WE TALKED ABOUT GERMANY NOT MEETING THE 2%. BUT WE HAVE 300,000 TROOPS IN GERMANY. MAY NOT BE 300,000. I THINK I I MISSPOKE. IT'S 35,000. BUT IT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. WE WANT GERMANY TO DO MORE, BUT WE RESPECT THAT THEY'RE DOING A LOT IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY'RE ONE OF THE FRAME WORK NATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN. SO WE WANT THEM TO MEET THE 2%, BUT THERE'S OTHER FACTORS. ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE INTERTWINED. SO YES, THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE TARIFFS. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. BUT WHAT I THINK IS THE PURPOSE HERE IS TO TRY TO GET A MORE EVEN TRADE RELATIONSHIP AND HAVE A TRUE ALLIANCE AT NATO THAT DOES HAVE SOME OF OUR ALLIES THAT HAVEN'T PUT UP AS MUCH AS THEY COULD WHILE THEY ARE GIVING IN OTHER AREAS TO BE HELPFUL. SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE ALL OF THIS. WE CANNOT STEP BACK ON THE 2%. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED FOR THE OVERALL BIG PICTURE SECURITY. BUT WE KNOW THAT MANY ALLIES ARE ALSO PUTTING TROOPS ON THE GROUND, ADVISING IN AFGHANISTAN. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE IRAQIS AS WELL FOR ADVISING THEM ON HOW TO GET ISIS OUT OF THEIR COUNTRY AND STABILIZE THEIR COUNTRY. SO WE'RE DOING MANY THINGS IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND WE HAVE TO FACTOR ALL OF THAT IN.
