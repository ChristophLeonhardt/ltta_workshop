Christine Blasi Ford will testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday remains unanswered and there is a back and forth currently taking place between senators Chuck Grassley other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the lawyers representing dr. Blasi and so first let's begin with the update indicating that there is a deadline for dr. Blasi and that was determined by Senator Chuck Grassley so senator Grassley set 10:00 a.m. Friday as the deadline for Christine Blasi Ford's legal team to respond to his request for her to speak to the committee that's not Friday next week that's Friday of this week meaning tomorrow by 10:00 a.m. yeah that's absurd yeah and it does it means something but it it means that we're really gonna go on without you on Monday that part I believe and that is very important it'll be the crux of what we discuss in a minute does she really have to meet it by 10 o'clock on Friday of course not if she said by 11:30 in the morning if she's like alright fine I'll testify no sorry you missed the deadline if both sides are trying to be tough guys when there's an issue you know I think one side is trying to be tough guys one side that's trying as hard as possible to push a confirmation through at any and all costs but we'll get to that in just a minute so by the way Grassley is also calling for the unredacted version of the letter that Ford had sent to Feinstein about the alleged incident I think that's fine I have no problem with that whatsoever now the response from Plaza's legal team they have indicated that she would be willing to testify next week so long as senators offer quote terms that are fair and which ensure her safety and that's according to an email that the lawmaker sent to committee staff members but they also included the following message Ford continues to believe that a full nonpartisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the committee however the committee stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good-faith investigation there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding so there there was another person named in these accusations another person who allegedly witnessed this according to doctor Aziz recollection of the alleged assault and that was Mark judge and so I think it makes sense for Mark judge to testify as well and and if he wants to deny it okay but do it under oath one other thing look if you stand by Kavanagh and you do not believe dr. Blau Z's allegations wouldn't you want the FBI to get involved again this wouldn't be a criminal investigation this would be an investigation to look into the allegations and see if you can get to the bottom of the truth but they don't want to do that which i think is just fascinating so I think there are three different things that are factors here and and different actors in the play so there's the Republican Party the Democratic Party and then dr. Blasi so the Republican Party wants this to be resolved as soon as possible with as little stain on Cavanaugh as possible as you're gonna see in a little bit grass these staffers have already said oh yeah we know he's the right guy and he's the one telling the truth and then why do you need the hearings okay so you apparently made up your mind already and of course of course they're playing politics and of course they want Kevyn Orr to get confirmed and and and if there were did if there's a delay it will go past the election in which case Democrats might regain control of Senate the Democrats are also playing politics and the Democrats who want to delay it's true and an FBI investigation would delay it longer now dr. Blasi the person affected here her interests are in a fair hearing so she's saying look why don't you do a nonpartisan investigation that and the FBI is not partisan and it's a background check they've done one on Cavanaugh before they've done one on every one of these Supreme Court justices and they have done new checks when new information came out as they did with Clarence Thomas and they made a hill controversy so and I'm asking you to have hearings where we hear from other witnesses and you might have more witnesses if you allow the FBI to investigator Chuck Grassley turns around and says I don't know that the FBI quote does not make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee no no which is a lie no well it's a it's a half a lie yes the FBI does not do the credibility assessment the Senate does but the FBI collects the information for you to be able to do the credibility assessment so grass is either saying the FBI's never involved in this process we to Anna's point a total lie or he's saying the FBI's normally involved but I don't want them involved in this case because I don't want new information to assess look my point in in in arguing that he's lying is that he's trying to make it seem as though it's unusual for the FBI to get involved in this process when it is not unusual at all at all that is exactly what happened in the Anita Hill hearings and so they don't want to get to the bottom of the truth they don't want to know they don't want to add Mark judge to this hearing they don't want to hear his testimony they don't want any of it they don't want any part because for them it is purely political and yes do Democrats have a political motive sure right but I don't care about what the intentions are what I care about is what they're calling for and what they're calling for is beyond reasonable we're not talking about you know a temporary position for someone we're talking about a lifetime appointment as a Supreme Court justice and so we need to do our due diligence the Senate should want to do its due diligence and make sure that they're confirming the right person for that job and that that's not what they want to do and so the politicians hypocrisy is of course as usual maddening so the same mitch mcconnell's and chuck Grassley who said that we should wait 14 months and not have a single hearing on Merrick garland to become the Supreme Court justice now turn around and go no we have to do immediately times of the essence how could they possibly delay this is an outrage I mean come on guys even if you're a Republican you have to say well they're obviously full of crap I mean they don't think time is of the aciss otherwise they wouldn't awaited 14 months on Merrick garland that's so they're playing politics period period period now if dr. blah Z's interests diverge from the Democrats she shouldn't give a damn what the Democrats think that's their job is to play politics on the other side okay so but right now she wants a fair hearing the Democrats want a longer hearing they happen to be aligned on that they don't have to be aligned right and if they're Democrats thought they could delay by having it some investigation that doctor was he didn't want she could say no I don't want that yeah and sorry to interrupt you jank but I want to be clear with the audience about how I would personally react if the shoe was on the other foot because I think that's important because for me this isn't political for me this is about getting to the heart of the truth right if the shoe were on the other foot we're still in the Obama administration he nominates someone and let's say a right-leaning accuser comes out and accuses a Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault right and that accuser calls for the FBI to get involved damn right I want the FBI involved yeah cuz I want to get to the heart of the truth right but that is not what they want yeah so and so that's where we are today so but the now they're super important question is will she go to testify on Monday because if she doesn't they're now saying that they will probably cancel the hearings altogether so I think she should go we've had this debate or discussion before I don't know where you stand on it today Anna but I think that from there's a couple of different perspectives here I think the Republicans have now circled the wagons and will get to say hey listen we gave her a shot and she just wouldn't come and that'll probably play okay in terms of politics okay so but then when you turn to the actual substance of the issue so how does that play out for dr. Blasi who's the potential victim here well then she never gets to tell her side of the story and a Kavanagh gets confirmed and we're done with it well I don't want that not the count on not being former I don't want him confirmed for other reasons I he's Pro corruption I'd go on and on right but I want her side of the story told and I don't want this to get railroaded and it looks like the Republicans are going to do that they feel like they've protected their PR flank enough that if she doesn't come they are gonna plow forward so I don't think they should if they are unwilling to allow the FBI to look into this I do not think she should testify when let me be clear about why okay because under these conditions when she does testify they will smear her okay you will have a group of middle-aged to elderly men okay asking her all sorts of humiliating questions very similar to what happened to Anita Hill maybe worse and I'm gonna give you an example of something that proves my point they've made up their minds they don't care about her testimony okay and should give you some evidence of that let's go to graphic seven so there's Mike Davis who had recently tweeted something and then deleted it he's the committee's chief staffer for nominations and he tweeted twice overnight about his key role in the committee's review of Christine Blasi Ford's allegation as well as criticism of Ford's attorneys and his desired outcome of the process so here's what he had tweeted and then later deleted unfazed and determined we will confirm judge Cavanaugh hashtag confirms Cavanaugh hashtag SCOTUS he also wrote I personally questioned judge Cavanaugh under penalty of felony and five years of imprisonment if he lies I'm still waiting to hear back from the accusers attorneys who can't find time between TV appearances to get back to me look he's made up his mind they have made up their mind so okay so she's gonna go and testify for what for what so they publicly in front of everyone and make her out to be the bad guy because she came forward with these allegations so look I'll make the case against that and then I'll help your case a little bit in some factors but I want everybody to know you guys can participate in this too we brought the polls back because this is such an important question and I as always genuinely care what what you guys think about this I'm curious what you guys think about this so it's T y-t-dot-com slash poll should Christine Blasi testify in the Cavanaugh hearings on Monday so yes or no we'll have those options for you it's very easy to RT diagram slash poll plug the link down below in the description box for your watching later on YouTube or Facebook okay Oh Anna I know that Dave I'm not naive it's not like the Republic's like hmm grass is like GI I don't know which way I'm gonna go with this this is the guy I want another Supreme Court for a long time and I'm you know anti-choice and I want him I think he's gonna overturn Roe vs. Wade but oh I care deeply about some sexual assault allegations we didn't care when Trump didn't care where Roy Moore did it etc at Senate right so of course they've made up their minds but there are a couple of important senators that are still can be swayed and they will decide whether this goes forward or not so there's Susan cause Lisa Murkowski or Republicans who claim that they are pro-choice and that they are Pro women's rights Jeff Flake a little bit bob Corker a tiny bit could be in play in terms of those senators now flake and corker are retiring and they don't like Trump so that gives you a tiny percentage chance that if they that they're genuinely listening and if they have a good enough reason to believe her that they might vote against Kavanagh cause and Murkowski might lose their seats if they vote again if they vote for Kavanagh after hearing compelling testimony from dr. Blasi so it's not I'm not thinking oh my god it Mitch McConnell might change his mind of course I'm Ted Cruz might change his mind of course not but there are but it depends on the testimony and yes will they attack her some of them will attack her probably viciously yes but that also it doesn't mean that they will win on those counts though the country will get to see it and when the country sees it the people who are already hate you know the idea that women can protect themselves and should have just equal rights etc will be like yeah we knew it she was had a good time at a party somewhere else many years later it's her fault she had it coming right yes there are people already saying that and there are people on the Left who are decent people who won't see that way at all and there are people in the middle like some Kansas moms that are out there who voted for Republicans in the past that'll see it and go I relate to that I think she was honest and what why are they attacking her like that and that'll piss them off well and select look that is one way that it could play out the only reason I give you all those options is because that it is not a foregone conclusion it's you know what I'm saying so Collins uh appears to be look she's not strongly supporting Kavanagh but based on the comments I've seen from Collins she seems more supportive than not she talks about you know speaking to Kavanagh one-on-one and saying that the conversation was excellent and so I don't know if if any testimony is going to convince her so but you do make a compelling case I don't know if I even really trust flake and corker but we'll see right I just worry because if she agrees to do this on their terms meaning the Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee if she does it on their terms they know what they're doing they've already made up their mind they're gonna smear her and I'm worried that they'll smear her so effectively that it won't even matter that she's testifying in the very people that you're hoping she'll swing or you know convince will remain supportive of Kavanagh that's what I'm concerned about and so nothing will get accomplished and you know they'll keep attacking her they'll keep smearing her and I think it makes all the sense in the world to just do the investigation and the fact but they're not gonna do it that's a fact and that's a thing I'm so tired of constantly just accepting that like these guys are terrible people and they don't want to do the investigation because it's all political for them so all right we got to accept it now we got to decide now the balls in her court I know I know we're in a tough spot like what else do you do but I'm just sick of caving to that so the two points that I make on your side is it's easy for us to say she should do it but we're not her look that she already go into hiding and the attacks against her will be not only vicious and over-the-top but potentially perpetual excuse me we've barely seen her face now but then everybody after these hearings she'll be one of the most famous people in the country and there will be a percentage of the right-wing that will despise her and say at a bare minimum say terrible things about her and look there that's how her attack her family there's still remember the thing that haunts me is the the lunatics who believed in Alex Jones is Sandy Hook conspiracy they made some of those family members the positives that are now suing him they lost their six-year-old kid in that tragedy and they've had to move seven times because lunatic right-wingers keep harassing them as threatening them threatening their lives so that's what she's got to look forward to for the rest of her life and somehow people think she did this what for her own advantage are you insane okay so it's easy for me to say she should do it but it is a hell of a personal toll that it is going to take and and and then the other thing is look there the other side also gets to participate the Democrats could defend her on the other hand they're Democrats oh yeah yeah Democrats have a great track record of being strong and defending people and doing the right thing I mean that's the thing right if like if I was a Democratic senator on that committee here because of the Democrats like let's just be like honest about we're here because of the Democrats okay I don't know how Republicans would have done it but I guarantee you that if they were in Obama shoes and they had the ability to nominate someone with 14 months left till the election they would have done something I don't know what trick they would pull out of their back pocket super easy they would have been gotten it done they they would have done what they did with a Gorsuch they would have just killed the filibuster immediately we're done with it and now we have the seat what are you gonna do about it it took like a second for them to do that cuz Democrats are such suckers and on purpose we've talked about it before so if there was a strong progressive on that committee they'd say not on my watch and you know and they'd counter-attack and they would defend but these are the Democrats so you will get a tepid defense very likely and so you're going into a lines I acknowledge all the Santa you're going into a lines then and and you've got these weak sauce or on your theoretically kind of I say on your side but not really they're on their side right and so they have a different agenda that she does so that's another factor but all that being said this is your only chance to tell the story and this is the chance to make a difference and so if it happened you got to go tell the truth there you got to tell people what happened so that we don't have a lifetime appointment go in the wrong direction so that's why I vote yes there's only one vote that matters which is hers but but it is a tough case that's why we're interested in what you think and it also sets an example for other women who might have been victimized in a similar way right if you're gonna come forward and you're gonna challenge someone in a position of power by bringing forth allegations like this you're the one who will be punished 100% guaranteed but on the other hand it also gives you an opportunity to finally fight back and I don't know that it's gonna make a difference at the end and I can't promise that but all you can do is give your side give your case and fight and and at least that is a form of justice so I hope that that is what happens and that people who get to hear from both sides and that we to the best of our abilities through this terrible political system that we have unfortunately where no one cares about the truth anymore they care what their donors want and you know and they have their marching orders and 98% of them are never gonna change their minds no matter what the facts are but maybe maybe we just arrived it a little bit more truth in justice if she testifies let's take a break when we come back more updates on the Cavanaugh story and later on we will discuss the spending bill that the Senate just signed off on we

Ford is asking for the smallest thing when demanding an investigation I don't want a Supreme Court justice who has potential allegation who knows what else they might find with a fine-tooth comb and in fact of course that's exactly what they might be afraid of now I'm gonna read to a bunch of member comments rebel dragons says the third person in the room doesn't want to testify because he knows under oath he would have to testify to not recalling the incident but he can't confirm that it didn't happen based on his drinking and blackout history that's an interesting take on it that's on Mike judge who was a third person in the room was back in Cavanaugh but says he doesn't recall vicious Crees says and this one I relate to the most if I was innocent and knew it to the effect that I rounded up 60 plus character witnesses to try to back me up that's the letter that they did I'd be begging for an investigation an effort to clear my name Cavanaugh acts guilty because he is so I don't know of course for a fact that he is but I would want him if I thought the investigators were honest I would definitely want an investigation absolutely because look without the investigation let's say the Republicans get exactly what they want he gets confirmed right if he didn't do it you have a huge portion of the country believing that you did because there was no investigation done to clear your name yeah Winnipeg Craig says for testifying isn't just about his nomination it's about forcing the Republicans to show who they are to the public it's about every future nomination in election to now I wouldn't blame her if she decides not to but if she does she could change the future of the country okay thank you guys great comments by the members as usual and if you would like your comments moved up then become a member as well to y-t-dot-com /join we're trying to give more and more benefits to membership including behind the scenes we've done a lot of super fun behind-the-scenes videos that you guys should check out too if you remember alright Anna what's next alright the smears aimed at dr. Christine Blasi Ford continue and the latest example was in the form of a blog post an anonymous blog post that Dinesh D'Souza decided to tweet out and all it does is essentially slut-shame the accuser and also other female students who went to the all-girls school that dr. Blasi went to holden arms now D'Souza tweeted the following no one in the media is covering the culture of hookups and binge drinking the accuser was part of by the way no evidence that she was part of that here's what they're trying to cover up and in that tweet he links to a blog post this is not a news article this was not something written by the New York Times Washington Post CNN it's a blog post okay and it's it's for this website called the cult of the First Amendment D'Souza tweeted that link to this article and it accused cat the Cavanaugh accuser of taking part in binge drinking and promiscuity while in high school no evidence of that by the way yeah I mean look Anna emphasizes blog posts not because you can't have perfectly good opinion isn't a blog et cetera but there's no evidence in there so he's linking to it as if it's an authoritative source what he's linking to his some dudes opinion backed up by no evidence at all no evidence so if you read through it I mean I encourage you go ahead read through it right there is nothing linking dr. Blasi to these allegations and even if it did even if there was evidence that she was drinking or having a good time or partying in high school who cares who cares you think that that's enough to clear Cavanaugh of any wrongdoing look at how but this is what this is what I mean when I urge conservative women to really reconsider the political party they're supporting okay sometimes I've said that in not so nice terms but let me just try to be as diplomatic as possible this is what they think of you if you were a victim of sexual assault and you come forward with your allegations they are going to pour over your past to see if there's anything they can use to smear you including partying which is something that everyone does when they're younger so if you've ever partied in your life then what you deserve to be sexually assaulted I don't get it and by the way they found nothing on her so Donald Trump jr. retweeted this they he thinks it's oh yeah let's go smear her that's that's great now in the blog post they talk about the clothes that other girls in that high school wore back then so lit they don't have any pictures of dr. Blasi they don't have anything on dr. Blasi first of all they looked and they couldn't find anything on dr. Blasi let's just note that okay so whenever they do go to do these smear jobs if they got a tiny little thing that means they looked and looked and looked and couldn't find a big thing in this case they couldn't find anything so they did guilt by association but is it even guilt so they're questioning what the girls wore when they were 15 or 16 from back in 1983 it's a me so does that mean that if they wore the wrong kind of skirt that somebody could rape them what no no I really want to know the logic yeah I want to know the logic that when they were 17 if they drank at a party does that mean that any guy in that party could rape them well I what they're trying to do is make it seem as though well these the girls who went to this school were promiscuous okay they were sexually so if this happened it was because she wanted it that's what I didn't that's the way that it gets interpreted right that's what he's implying mm-hmm there was drinking there was promiscuity so she wanted it it was probably a consensual thing so they're trying all different avenues at attacking her every high school has some degree of drinking and some degree of promiscuity that isn't the issue for example we have now said a thousand times in the last four or five days that Kavanagh drank a lot in high school we don't care that isn't the issue at all a lot of people drank in high school that's not the issue the issue is what he did on that day which appears to be the allegations are of attempted rape that matters not the drinking so not what she wore that day not if she had a drink not if he had a drink we're not going back to 1983 and judging every little minutia of either side we're talking about only and by the way we have excellent credibility on this because on the very first day before we knew what it was I said we all said it depends on what he did it was high school if it was a small thing a mid-sized thing you can't go all the way back to high school it would have to cross a very high bar that's literally what we said on day one and it turns out it was attempted rape that's dead crosses the high bar so it what do they do they say oh yeah yeah you guys are going back there oh yeah well then I'm gonna go back there and judge everything they did today any not her but did anybody else at that high school ever have a drink that they ever wear the wrong kind of skirt are you kidding me so that's who they are yeah and I look this is just my opinion but I wouldn't use a convicted felon as an arbiter of criminality ever so it's very ironic that he he thinks that he could be the judgment of good behavior I mean this guy is a convicted felon period that's the Nash d'souza he went to jail over it of course another lifelong criminal eventually pardoned him that's Donald Trump Donald Trump juniors father obviously but no he was convicted and he went he went to jail any he's a felon and and so but the Republicans still talk about him like oh well he did a movie about the corruption of Hillary Clinton you know what Dinesh D'Souza went to jail for corruption he did he violated campaign finance laws and tried to get around them and give more money than he was allowed to give to a candidate that he liked it's there's a colloquial word for that it's called corruption but they're like Oh Bravo the corruption of Hillary Clinton Dinesh D'Souza they think that they're the that is of family values and morality and here they are try to excuse attempted rape because young girls had it coming because they also at some point drank at a party it's effin gross man all right a lot of attention is being played paid on let me start that again a lot of attention is being paid toward Senator Susan Collins whether or not as a moderate Republican she would be willing to vote in favor of the confirmation of Judge Cavanaugh now she says that things have gotten a little too difficult a little too heated and she's dealing with threats and a Democratic lawmaker mocked those threats and we're gonna get to that in just a minute but before we do I want you to hear from Susan Collins yourselves and here which she has to say about those threats so remember that Senator Collins is a moderate Republican it everyone's pretty unsure as to how she's gonna vote in these confirmation hearings and so I just give you that note because while I believe that she is getting threats I mean in today's political climate is definitely possible there's no indication that those threats are only coming from liberals are only coming from Republicans there are conservatives in the country who really want judge Kavanagh to be confirmed and so I think that there's some panic involving Collins and whether or not she would vote in favor of his confirmation so just keep that in mind but then you have representative Eric SWA well Democrat from California and he heard about these threats and decided to share his own opinions on them and got a lot of heat for it so he said the following on Twitter boo-hoo-hoo you're a senator who you're a senator whose police will protect a sexual assault victim can't sleep in her home tonight because of threats where are you sleeping Ford's on her words on her own while you and your Senate GOP colleagues tried to rush her through a hearing so he later deleted and apologized for those tweets because they were interpreted as mocking the fact that Collins is dealing with threats but with that said while I think it should be taken seriously that she is dealing with threats the heart of what he's saying there is right I mean you have the accuser here doctor Blasi in hiding she had to move out of her home her family is afraid she had to hire private security and so yeah there are death threats all around the country at all times but people like Blasi Ford don't get the protection that someone like Susan Collins gets so first of all anna's right we have no idea if right-wingers might have been calling in to say don't you dare vote against Kavanagh they're the ones that far far far more consistently threaten violence do violence because they believe in violence as progressives we don't believe in violence and so if you are progressive who called in don't ever threaten violence now by the way we actually have no idea of anyone on the right or the left threatened violence at all they just her office and you heard her the senators herself say it but our office also says the same thing that the calls and messages were quote ugly and abusive that could mean anything that could mean I don't like you or what and so now we're stuck in a situation where there's two different rules and so on the one hand I don't want anybody to threaten violence ever ever against anyone whether they're Republican or Democrat now on the other hand we and online and all of you who've ever dealt with any trolls or anybody online gets threatened non-stop and no one cares so there's this uneven rules if you touch someone inside the club and you are not quite so nice on a voicemail then it's a five alarm fire and if anybody ever says anything about it the the club gets super mad and they're like how dare you that's of our beloved Susan Collins right whereas every well everyone else online can be viciously attacked non-stop death threats galore and nobody can the club cares that's just you guys so I'll give you guys an example uh and and I think this is one of the more important examples because these are people who were already victimized the parents who lost their young son in the Sandy Hook shooting after Alex Jones accused them of being crisis actors and accused this of all being a false flag operation to take guns away from Americans they were harassed so incessantly that they had to move seven times and by the way do you think there's anyone helping them financially to do that do you think there's anyone protecting them they had to move it's not only seven times if finally they ended up in a secure community a gated community with extra security just so they can say stay safe because the threats were so specific and that's the reason why they're now suing Alex Jones for the fam'ly Tory defamatory claims he was making on his show but I bring that up because they're on their own right whereas you know you're a US senator you're not on your own you get that protection added as part of your job and I'm glad that you get that protection but the five-alarm fire as Jake mentioned is fascinating coming from someone who has that extra security and sometimes this uses a ruse I don't think in this case it is I think Collins has been so sheltered in her life that she's I don't know if she's ever gotten an angry comment in her life because they live in such a bubble right but you know there was there's a Democratic candidate in the middle of country this woman running and they could a couple of times that people are taking a shot at her they what they're unaware of is there are right-wing fanatics in this country who believe in violence and they threaten it all the time and so if you do it against the senator you're gonna be in a world of trouble because they're powerful they're rich they're elite okay you do it against somebody who's just a candidate who's running in the middle of the country and she's on her own yeah you know you do it to the the Sandy Hook parents they're on their own I pulled a random video to make this point earlier on a similar story where I just looked through a couple of pages of comments on one of our youtube videos and there's 60,000 of them on just one and we had half a dozen death threats on just two pages of one video and every video has dozens and dozens of pages of comments and so is anybody here to protect anybody online no you're on your own right so that's why when someone leaves a quote-unquote ugly comment on the voicemail of a elite all of a sudden that elites are like how dare you we must protect our elites but the rest of you good luck so that's what's frustrating Susan Collins should be protected so should the rest of us but unfortunately that doesn't exist and in this case and to be fair to Susan Collins again no dude no disrespect towards her I don't want anybody to threaten her in any way shape or form and in this case she's saying hey we should go protect dr. Blasio right and she heard her on the tapes yes to her credit she said we should provide security and they should the government should have stepped up immediately to provide her security but they should on many instances and there's a case to be made that they should do it for his Sandy Hook parents they definitely should do it for that candidate in the country and I don't care if it's a Democrat or a Republican if you're if people are endangering your life then the government needs to protect you that's the whole point of the government right for me this is much less about Susan Collins but more about the double standard you know and the differences in treatment when it comes to the elite versus the rest of us and so if that's why sois well had a world of hurt poured on his head when he said this and and then he had to backpedal and said it was stupid and I and he apologized if he had done it to a regular person nobody would have cared yeah all right um we got to take a break but when we come back we have a different Susan Collins story that I think is important this one has to do with her own double standard in regard to money in politics loves it when it supports her hates it when it doesn't yes now you've you thought I was angry with the Dinesh D'Souza's story or this story where do you get a load of me on that next story can't remember to get the whole show T y-t-dot-com /join that goes to the heart of what gets me the most angry at her pot here we kind of halfway defended her there we will not be defending her at all because that she proves what an elitist she is and how ridiculous this whole system is I will come right back
