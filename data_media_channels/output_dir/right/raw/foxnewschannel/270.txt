AINSLEY: GOOD MORNING.

00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:15,951
WE SAW GRIFF'S A REPORT ON THE

13
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:17,252
AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE MICHAEL.

14
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:19,121
WHAT WILL THE RECOVERY LOOK

15
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:19,421

00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:25,527
WE'LL MAKE IT GO FAST.

18
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:27,930
WE'RE FOLLOWING IT IN.

19
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,331
IT IS GONE FROM CERTAIN AREAS.

20
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:31,600
ONE THING WE HAVE TO OUR

21
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:32,568
ADVANTAGE WAS THE SPEED.

22
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:34,002
THIS THING WAS IN AND OUT.

23
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,438
WE HAVEN'T SEEN POWER LIKE THAT.

24
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:43,011
I WAS GET REPORTS ALL NIGHT.

ONE POINT IT REACHED 200 MILES

27
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:48,283
AN HOUR.

28
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:50,018
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE.

29
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:52,521
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY

30
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:53,756
STRONGER WIND, THIS IS IN

31
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:54,089
HISTORY.

32
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,924
IT WAS POWERFUL.

33
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:58,494
IT WAS A SPEEDSTER AND IT WAS IN

34
00:00:58,495 --> 00:00:59,928
AND NOW IT IS OUT.

35
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,030
IT IS IN GEORGIA.

36
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,632
I SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR.

37
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,501
THEY ARE HANDLING IT VERY WELL,

38
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,469
THE WINDS ARE DOWN TO 60 MILES

39
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,803
AN HOUR.

40
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:09,304
WHICH IS A LOT.

41
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:10,873
60 MILES AN HOUR.

42
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:12,975
IT IS DISSIPATING AND IT WAS

43
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:13,442
FAST.

44
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:14,977
STEVE: YOU'RE A FLORIDA PROPERTY

45
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:15,277

NIGHT?

53
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:27,623
>> I THINK REALLY WHEN I

54
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:29,625
EXPLAINED IT THERE WAS NO HEAT.

55
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,727
I HAD VERY LITTLE HEAT OTHER

56
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,328
THAN THE NATURAL HATERS WHICH

57
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,097
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME.

58
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:36,465
WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

59
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,332
STANDING IN LINE.

60
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,735
IT IS A GREAT THING THAT IS

61
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:40,102
HAPPENING.

62
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:42,004
IT'S A GREAT MOVEMENT IN OUR

63
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:42,337
COUNTRY.

64
00:01:42,338 --> 00:01:45,808
I MAKE A SPEECH IN 12,000 SEAT

65
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:46,208
AUDITORIUM.

66
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,243
PEOPLE START LINING UP TWO DAYS

67
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:49,244
EARLY.

68
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,813
LITERALLY THEY BRING TENTS.

69
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:52,981
WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED

70
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:55,884
UP BY THE TIME I HAD TO MAKE A

71
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,251
DECISION.

72
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:58,353
IS MY DECISION, TELL PEOPLE

73
00:01:58,354 --> 00:01:59,755
WAITING 10, 12 HOURS ALREADY,

74
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:00,923
THAT I'M NOT COMING?

75
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,791
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE --

76
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,493
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF

77
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:04,827
PEOPLE.

78
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:07,062
YOU SAW THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN THE

79
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,096
AUDITORIUM WHICH HELD ABOUT

80
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:10,332
12,000 PEOPLE, IT WAS FULL AND

81
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,001
WE HAD 20 OR 25,000 PEOPLE

82
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,069
OUTSIDE WATCHING SCREENS.

83
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,004
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY GET THERE

84
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:17,706
THAT EARLY AND, YOU KNOW, THAT

85
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,842
AREA OBVIOUSLY IS NOT AFFECTED

86
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:23,545
AT ALL BY IT, WE HAD IT UNDER

87
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:25,113
GREAT CONTROL BECAUSE FEMA AND

88
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:26,648
EVERYTHING ELSE, WE HAD

89
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:29,218
WHITE HOUSE ON THE PLANE --

90
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,786
STEVE: YOU WERE MONITORING.

91
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,621
>> I WAS TOTALLY MONITORING.

92
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:33,622
I MADE THE SPEECH.

93
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:34,623
EVERYBODY WAS UNHAPPY.

94
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,191
IT WOULD BE REALLY UNFAIR TO ALL

95
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:37,059
THE PEOPLE WAITING.

96
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS

97
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,027
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

98
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,263
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNFAIR,

99
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:42,731
I DON'T THINK REALLY THE HEAT

100
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:43,565
WAS VERY HOT.

101
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,867
RELATIVE TO OTHER THINGS I THINK

102
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:47,302
IT WAS VERY MINOR.

103
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:48,871
BRIAN: MR. PRESIDENT TODAY AT

104
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:51,106
LUNCH WILL NOT BE ANY NORMAL

105
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:51,406
LUNCH.

106
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,841
YOU WILL HAVE ONE OF THE

107
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:55,077
GREATEST ATHLETES AND ACTIVISTS

108
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,378
IN AMERICAN HISTORY, JIM BROWN.

109
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,617
AMAN WHO WAS TOLD IN COLLEGE

110
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:04,186
BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK HE COULDN'T

111
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:06,822
STAY WITH HIS TEAM SYRACUSE ON

112
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,423
THE ROAD.

113
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,726
ALSO WITH KANYE WEST.

114
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:12,427
YOU WILL TALK SUBSTANCE.

115
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:15,063
THESE ARE TWO YEAR SUPPORTERS.

116
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,198
WHAT DO YOU HOPE COMES OUT OF

117
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,032
THE MEETING?

118
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,166
FRIENDSHIP IS.

119
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:21,003
THERE MUTUAL RESPECT IS ALREADY

120
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:21,370
APPARENT.

121
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,238
WHAT SUBSTANTIVE CAN COME OUT OF

122
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,673
THE MEETING?

123
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:26,508
>> BRIAN, I HAVE A LOT OF

124
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,509
AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT AND A

125
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,245
LOT DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST

126
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:32,648
LITTLE WHILE WITH KANYE COMING

127
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:32,915
OUT.

128
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,617
JIM BROWN HAS BEEN THERE A LONG

129
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:35,918
TIME.

130
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,619
I HAVE KNOWN HIM, RESPECTED HIM.

131
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,655
CAN YOU IMAGINE HIM PLAYING IN

132
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:41,757
THE NFL WHAT HE WOULD BE MAKING?

133
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,725
DOUBLE WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS

134
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:44,059
GETTING.

135
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,360
HE WAS THE GREATEST.

136
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,895
HE CAME OUT A LONG TIME AGO FOR

137
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:49,431
ME, WHEN IT WAS MUCH LESS

138
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,399
FASHIONABLE FRANKLY AND NOW YOU

139
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,433
SEE THE RESULTS.

140
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,435
WE HAVE THE LOWEST, IF YOU LOOK

141
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,137
AT UNEMPLOYMENT, IF YOU LOOK AT

142
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:57,105
ANY STATISTIC, LOWEST

143
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:58,507
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR

144
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:00,309
AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN HISTORY, IN

145
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,642
HISTORY.

146
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:03,078
THE HIGHEST MEDIAN INCOME,

147
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,213
INCOME, THINK OF IT, HIGHEST IN

148
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:06,415
HISTORY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS OF

149
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:10,018
THE NOW THAT INCLUDES ALSO

150
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,186
SEPARATELY ASIAN-AMERICANS,

151
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:11,720
HISPANIC-AMERICANS.

152
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:13,455
WE HAVE THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT

153
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:16,325
NUMBERS, THE BEST MEDIAN INCOME

154
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:16,725
NUMBERS.

155
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:20,429
CRIME RATES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

156
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,031
WHERE YOU HAVE A REALLY BAD, BAD

157
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:24,399
NUMBER FOR YEARS.

158
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,834
YOU'VE HAD TERRIBLE NUMBERS.

159
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:27,536
THOSE CRIME RATES ARE COMING

160
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:27,836
DOWN.

161
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:29,938
IN CHICAGO WHICH IS RUN BY

162
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,840
DEMOCRATS I SAID JUST YESTERDAY,

163
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,675
I SAID WE'RE GOING TO GET

164
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:34,676
INVOLVED IN CHICAGO.

165
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:36,211
IT IS RIDICULOUS WHAT IS

166
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,346
HAPPENING IN CHICAGO.

167
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,047
THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT.

168
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:40,749
SO WE'LL GET INVOLVED AND TRY TO

169
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,317
WORK WITH THE MAYOR IF THAT IS

170
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:42,684
POSSIBLE.

171
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:44,886
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS ANYBODY'S

172
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:45,287
INVOLVEMENT.

173
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:46,455
WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

174
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:48,156
BRIAN: HE WILL BE OUT OF THERE

175
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:48,590
SON ANYWAY.

176
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:50,859
>> HE WILL BE GONE --

177
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,694
BRIAN: MR. PRESIDENT, JIM BROWN

178
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:53,829
GOT A CURRICULUM.

179
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,664
HE HAS BEEN WORKING IN PRISONS

180
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:56,865
20 YEARS WITH HIS AMERICAN

181
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:57,199
PROGRAM.

182
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,267
WOULD YOU BE TEMPTED TO ADOPT

183
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:02,871
HIS PROGRAM WHOLESALE?

184
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:04,806
>> WELL, WHAT'S HAPPENING, JIM

185
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:09,077
HE GETS IT, VERY MUCH GETS IT.

186
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:09,911
AND I GET IT.

187
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:12,214
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR

188
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:14,082
REALLY LONG TERMS, LIKE

189
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,751
MRS. JOHNSON AS AN EXAMPLE, SHE

190
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:18,220
HAD ANOTHER 22 YEARS TO SERVE.

191
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,888
SHE WAS IN THERE FOR 20 YEARS.

192
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,289
SHE IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE

193
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,858
WOMAN, HOW THIS WOULD HAVE

194
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:23,225
HAPPENED.

195
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:25,127
MAYBE IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME, A

196
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:26,995
DIFFERENT AGE BUT WE DO NEED

197
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:27,329
REFORM.

198
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,530
THAT DOESN'T MEAN EASY.

199
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:30,098
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE CERTAIN

200
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:32,401
CATEGORIES TOUGHER WHEN IT COMES

201
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:34,236
TO DRUG DEALING AND OTHER THINGS

202
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:35,937
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A REFORM

203
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:37,239
BECAUSE IT IS VERY UNFAIR RIGHT

204
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,508
NOW OF THE IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO

205
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,008
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

206
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,477
IT IS VERY UNFAIR TO EVERYBODY

207
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:44,646
AND IT IS ALSO VERY COSTLY.

208
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:46,114
SOME OF THE, IF YOU LOOK WHAT

HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.

211
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:51,153
TEXAS IS THOUGHT OF BEING A

212
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:54,723
TOUGH STATE AND ALSO GEORGIA,

HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

216
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:00,762
THEY'RE TOUGH, THEY'RE FIRM, BUT

217
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:02,097
THEY HAVE REALLY DONE A

218
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:03,532
TREMENDOUS JOB WITH REFORM.

219
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,267

HE CAME OUT AFTER "SATURDAY

247
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,017
NIGHT LIVE," HOW HE WAS GOTTEN

248
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:57,719
PUSHED AROUND AND TOLD NOT TO DO

249
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,020
STUFF DURING THE WEEK, HE HAS

250
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:01,123
TAKEN A LOT OF HEAT FOR BEING

251
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,157
YOUR SUPPORTER.

252
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:03,859
HARD TO BE A SUPPORTER WHEN

253
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,961
PEOPLE ARE GANGING UP ON YOU.

254
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:08,363
>> I TELL YOU, FIRST OF ALL, I

255
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:09,197
LIKE HIM A LOT.

256
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:10,932
HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE.

257
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:14,903
I'VE KNOWN HIM A LONG TIME.

258
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,772
HE A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF A

259
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,473
GUY, I SAY THAT IN POSITIVE WAY.

260
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:21,042
HE IS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF A

261
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:21,309
GUY.

262
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,980
THOSE IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS SAY

263
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,581
HE IS A GENIUS.

264
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:28,150
THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.

265
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:31,887
WHEN KANYE CAME OUT COUPLE

266
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:33,421
MONTHS AGO, SOMETHING HAPPENED,

267
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:35,557
MY POLLS WENT UP 25%.

268
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:36,391
NOBODY EVER SEEN IT.

269
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:38,426
HE HAS A BIG FOLLOWING IN THE

270
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:39,094
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

271
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,495
A BIG, BIG FOLLOWING.

272
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:42,063
I THINK HE HAS IN A LET OF

273
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,465
COMMUNITIES, BUT THE POLLS WENT

274
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,166
THROUGH THE ROOF.

275
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:48,937
I HAVE NOT SEEN, I THINK I HAVE

276
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,338
HONESTLY SAID I NEVER SEEN THAT

277
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,606
BEFORE TO THAT EXTENT.

278
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:53,942
HE IS RESPECTED.

279
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,610
HE IS REALLY A GREAT GUY.

280
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,611
YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS?

281
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:59,047
HE IS NOT ASKING ANYTHING FOR

282
00:07:59,048 --> 00:07:59,447
HIMSELF.

283
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:01,283
HE DOESN'T SAY GEE, I WANT TO DO

284
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:02,651
THIS OR THAT.

285
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:03,718
HE IS A PRIVATE GUY.

286
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:05,020
HE WANTS TO HELP PEOPLE.

287
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,122
MORE THAN ANYTHING IS PRISON

288
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:10,959
REFORM BECAUSE HIS WIFE, WAS

289
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,660
TERRIFIC, KIM.

290
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,128
SHE BROUGHT THE ATTENTION TO

291
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,462
MRS. JOHNSON WHERE I COULD LOOK.

292
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:16,231
YOU HAVE MANY PEOPLE LIKE

293
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,500
MRS. JOHNSON IN JAIL FOR ANOTHER

294
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,069
35 YEARS ON A CHARGE THAT

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,604
FRANKLY EVERYTHING IS SERIOUS,

296
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:26,474
BUT YOU DON'T GET LIFE IN

297
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:27,309
PRISONMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE

298
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,910
TALKING OVER A TELEPHONE ABOUT

299
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:29,277
SOMETHING.

300
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:30,612
BRIAN: I HEARD YOUR ATTORNEY

301
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:32,414

00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:36,785
WAY IS THAT ACCURATE?

305
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:38,352

306
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,120
OVERRULED BY ME.

307
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,655
