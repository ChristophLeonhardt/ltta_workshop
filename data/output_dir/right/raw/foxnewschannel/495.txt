1
00:00:01,093 --> 00:00:04,497
PRIVILEGE, I'M GOING TO CALL ON

2
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:05,197
SENATOR FLAKE TO SPEAK.

3
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:07,400
NORMALLY WE WOULD START THE VOTE

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,335
RIGHT NOW BUT AS A POINT OF

5
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:10,536
PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I WOULD CALL

6
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:11,337
ON SENATOR FLAKE.

7
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:14,273
>> THANK YOU.

8
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:15,575
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A

9
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:17,476
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER

10
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,678
SIDE, WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS

11
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:22,682
ON GOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD

12
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:25,084
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE

13
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:25,551
DILIGENCE HERE.

14
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:29,922
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE PROPER

15
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:33,125
TO DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE.

16
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,528
FOR UP TO, BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE

17
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:35,828
WEEK.

18
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:39,899
IN ORDER TO LET THE FBI

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,500
CONTINUE -- TO DO AN

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,169
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN TIME

21
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:46,138
AND SCOPE, THE CURRENT

22
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:49,375
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THERE,

23
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,811
LIMITED IN TIME TO MORE THAN ONE

24
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:55,915
WEEK.

25
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:57,617
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL

26
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:58,184
TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT

27
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:58,951
UNDERSTANDING AND I'VE SPOKEN TO

28
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:02,922
A FEW OTHER MEMBERS WHO ON MY

29
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:05,291
SIDE OF THE AISLE MAY BE

30
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:05,892
SUPPORTIVE AS WELL.

31
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:06,425
THAT'S MY POSITION.

32
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:17,503
I THINK THAT DOING DUE DILIGENCE

33
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,105
IS IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO SAY

34
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:20,907
THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ACTED

35
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:21,274
PROPERLY.

36
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:24,076
THE CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER

37
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:24,811
BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS

38
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,680
FROM THIS COMMITTEE.

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,915
AND TO DELAY THIS VOTE IN THIS

40
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:36,122
COMMITTEE FOR A WEEK SO THAT

41
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:37,023
DR. FORD CAN BE HEARD.

42
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:41,227
AND SHE WAS YESTERDAY.

43
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:41,894
SO THAT'S WITHOUT AGREEMENT.

44
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,663
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL

45
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:49,435
TO THE FLOOR.

46
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:52,272
ONE SECOND, CAN DIANE SPEAK?

47
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,774
>> WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON?

48
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:57,710
WE ARE VOTING ON THE MOTION TO

49
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,879
REPORT THE NOMINATION TO THE

50
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,383
FLOOR.

51
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:07,520
>> THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING,

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,159
LET THE SENATOR EXPLAIN IT.

53
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,530
>> MY UNDERSTANDING, THE

54
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,564
DEMOCRATS COULD SPEAK TO IT,

55
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:20,467
CHRIS OR YOU AS WE TALKED ABOUT

56
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:20,901
BEFORE.

57
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,269
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD ACCEPT AND

58
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,705
ENDORSE ALL ONE WEEK FBI

59
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:26,406
INVESTIGATION LIMITED IN TIME

60
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:28,742
AND SCOPE.

61
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:30,911
>> SINCE YOU ARE THE DECIDING

62
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:31,978
VOTE HERE, WE WILL VOTE AND IF

63
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:34,080
THERE'S ANY SORT OF DISCUSSION

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,348
WE WILL DO THAT AFTER THE VOTE.

65
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:48,729
CALL THE ROLE.

66
00:02:48,729 --> 00:03:02,876
>> MR KENNEDY, MR FLAKE, MR.

00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,318

70
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:12,686

00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:12,987
>> NO.

72
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:13,654

>> NO.

74
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:25,799
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THE VOTES ARE

75
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,702
11 NAY, 10 YEA.

76
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:31,338
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

77
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,107
GIVING US THE TIME TODAY TO HAVE

78
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:34,508
IT IN A CONVERSATION.

79
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:35,409
A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

80
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:37,678
ASKED FOR A ONE WEEK DELAY IN

81
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:40,047
ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN FBI

82
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:40,614
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT

83
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:43,984
ALLEGATIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEFORE

84
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:44,518
THIS COMMITTEE.

85
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:47,221
I RESPECT SENATOR FLAKE'S VIEW

86
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,857
THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WAS BEST

87
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:51,825
TO RESPECT YOUR HAVING GIVEN

88
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,894
DR. FORD THE TIME TO BE HEARD

89
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:54,528
YESTERDAY AND ADVANCE THE

90
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,297
NOMINEE TO THE FLOOR.

91
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:58,499
BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE COULD

92
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:01,502
WORK TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN

93
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,603
BASIS TO DILIGENTLY PURSUE AN

94
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:04,672
FBI INVESTIGATION WITHIN THE

95
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:05,906
NEXT WEEK.

96
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:08,342
NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DELAY BUT

97
00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:10,311
FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING

98
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:11,312
FURTHER EITHER ALLEGATIONS MADE

99
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:15,916
BY DR. FORD OR OTHERS WITH A

100
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,983
GOAL TOWARDS DEMONSTRATING A

101
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,152
BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO

102
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:19,019
DILIGENTLY INVESTIGATE THESE

103
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,688
ALLEGATIONS.

104
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,757
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

105
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,625
THANK YOU, SENATOR FLAKE.

106
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,527
>> I WOULD SUPPORT THAT MOTION.

107
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:29,330
I THINK WE DO NEED THIS

108
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,331
INVESTIGATION.

109
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:31,132
I SORT OF MISUNDERSTOOD

110
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:31,966
SENATOR FLAKE WHAT YOU ARE

111
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:34,802
DOING, I THOUGHT IT INCLUDED A

112
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:35,503
ONE-WEEK INVESTIGATION.

113
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:38,105
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE

114
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:41,509
MOTION FOR THAT INVESTIGATION.

115
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,912
>> WE WILL TAKE TURNS A YEAR,

116
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:45,346
SENATOR.

117
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:46,814
>> I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE

118
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:49,751
ARE NOT THE MAJORITY.

119
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,685
SENATOR FLAKE HAS MADE CLEAR

120
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:53,287
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO BE

121
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,323
COMFORTABLE ON A FINAL PASSAGE

122
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:55,623
VOTE.

123
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:56,558
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE SAY

124
00:04:56,558 --> 00:05:04,699
HERE, THIS WILL BE UP TO

125
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,668
SENATOR SCHUMER IN

126
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:08,636
SENATOR McCONNELL.

127
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:12,207
>> SENATOR LEAHY HE?

128
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,575
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO

129
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:15,043
MAKE SURE BECAUSE THIS IS

130
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:15,844
SOMEWHAT UNPRECEDENTED.

131
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:17,378
WHEN I DO AGREE WITH THE

132
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:19,147
SENATOR FROM ARIZONA THAT WE

133
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,083
SHOULD HAVE THIS FURTHER

134
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:22,517
INVESTIGATION.

135
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:25,486
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

136
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:27,422
DURING THE WEEK THAT THAT IS

137
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:30,325
TAKING PLACE, THERE WILL BE

138
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:33,328
NO ACTION ON THE FLOOR OF

139
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:36,231
THE UNITED STATES SENATE ON

140
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:37,966
THIS NOMINATION.

141
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,267
IS THAT CORRECT?

142
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,269
>> I CANNOT SAY THAT --

143
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,370
>> -- LET ME SAY AGAIN.

144
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,172
I CAN'T MAKE THAT STATEMENT

145
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:45,106
FOR THE LEADERSHIP.

146
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:47,409
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WOULD

147
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,711
BE ONLY COMFORTABLE MOVING

148
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:50,678
FORWARD ON THE FLOOR, I WILL

149
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:51,813
MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.

150
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,748
BUT I WILL ONLY BE

151
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:54,549
COMFORTABLE MOVING ON THE

152
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:57,318
FLOOR UNTIL THE FBI HAS DONE

153
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:58,653
MORE INVESTIGATION THAN THEY

154
00:05:58,653 --> 00:05:59,654
HAVE ALREADY.

155
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:02,290
IT MAY NOT TAKE THEM A WEEK.

156
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,324
I UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF

157
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:04,993
THESE WITNESSES MAY NOT WANT

158
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,895
TO DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER.

159
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:09,764
BUT, I THINK WE OWE THEM DUE

160
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:10,131
DILIGENCE.

161
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,732
>> FROM CHAIRMAN.

162
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:11,566
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

163
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:14,035
>> JUST A MINUTE.

164
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:16,204
ALL I HAVE SAID TO SENATOR

165
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,939
FLAKE IS THAT I WOULD

166
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,308
ADVOCATE FOR THE POSITION HE

167
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:22,110
TOOK BUT I DON'T CONTROL

168
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,544
THAT SENATOR?

169
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:23,845
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

170
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:25,447
>> YES.

171
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:26,648
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR.

172
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,083
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE

173
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,218
OTHER SENATORS AS WELL WHO

174
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:34,089
MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS

175
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:34,723
NEGOTIATION ON THE

176
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,224
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THERE IS

177
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:39,127
NOT REALLY A SET AGREEMENT

178
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:39,427
HERE.

179
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:40,595
ALL OF US HAVE ALREADY SAID

180
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:41,563
WE ARE VOTING NO.

181
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:43,265
IT IS SENATOR FLAKE WORKING

182
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:44,633
WITH ALL OF US TO SAY FOR

183
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,734
THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND

184
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,737
THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE

185
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,005
AMERICAN TEAM DESERVE TO

186
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,239
HAVE THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP

187
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:51,506
ON.

188
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:54,009
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS

189
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:54,809
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT.

190
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:56,678
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS

191
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:56,978
ABOUT.

192
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:58,680
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT AND BY

193
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,048
THE WAY, IF SENATOR

194
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:00,882
MCCONNELL WANTS TO GO

195
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,384
FORWARD IN LIGHT OF THAT AND

196
00:07:02,384 --> 00:07:03,385
WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL

197
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:04,619
SENATORS THAT HAVEN'T SAID

198
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:05,954
HOW THEY ARE VOTING ON THIS

199
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:08,623
NOMINEE, I ACTUALLY THINK

200
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:10,459
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT

201
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:11,093
JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW.

202
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:12,627
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN

203
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:12,994
AGREEMENT.

204
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,296
IT IS ONE SENATOR WHO IS

205
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:15,564
STANDING UP.

206
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:16,932
>> SENATOR CORNYN?

207
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:18,834
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I JUST WANT

208
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:20,503
TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION

209
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:21,670
TO SENATOR FLAKE FOR

210
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,838
ALLOWING THIS PROCESS TO

211
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:23,472
MOVE FORWARD.

212
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:24,573
THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE OF

213
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,075
OPINION AMONG US AS TO WHAT

214
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,676
EXACTLY THE FBI

215
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:29,545
INVESTIGATION WOULD CONSIST

216
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:29,812
OF.

217
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:32,014
SOME OF US THINK IT HAS BEEN

218
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:35,251
CONCLUDED AND SUM ELEMENT

219
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,152
SUPPLEMENTED BY THIS

220
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:36,986
COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION

221
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:38,454
OTHERS DISAGREE WITH THAT I

222
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:39,789
RESPECT THE FACT THAT NOT

223
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,190
ONLY SENATOR FLAKE ADVOCATED

224
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,892
TO GIVE DR. FORD A CHANCE TO

225
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:44,426
APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE

226
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:45,261
COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS THE

227
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,962
RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT ALSO

228
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:48,764
THAT HE HAS ALLOWED THIS

229
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:50,232
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD,

230
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:51,634
SUBJECT TO FURTHER

231
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:53,769
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

232
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:55,504
FBI MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE

233
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:56,906
TO COME UP WITH.

234
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:58,774
BUT, CERTAINLY, HE MAINTAINS

235
00:07:58,774 --> 00:08:00,743
HIS RIGHT TO CAST HIS VOTE

236
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:02,978
YEA OR NEY AS HE SEES FIT

237
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:04,613
AND MAINTAINS SIGNIFICANT

238
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:05,548
LEVERAGE THAT WAY.

239
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:07,983
BUT, I APPRECIATE HIS

240
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:09,452
SUPPORT FOR A FULL AND FAIR

241
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:11,988
HEARING FOR DR. FORD AND

242
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:12,655
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS WELL AS

243
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:13,856
HIS WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW

244
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:16,325
THIS TO GO FORWARD SUBJECT

245
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,660
TO HIS REQUEST.

246
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,229
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

247
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,966
>> SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, OUGHT

248
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:25,868
TO CALL ON SENATOR

249
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:26,235
FEINSTEIN.

250
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:28,204
>> IF I, THROUGH THE CHAIR,

251
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:29,272
COULD HAVE ASK A QUESTION OF

252
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:31,240
SENATOR FLAKE, DOES YOUR

253
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,942
AMENDMENT INCLUDE CONTINUING

254
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:33,743
THE INVESTIGATION DURING

255
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,845
THIS PERIOD OF TIME?

256
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,014
>> IF I CAN RESPOND, THERE

257
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:39,982
IS NO AMENDMENT.

258
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:41,217
I'M SIMPLY STATING THE

259
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:42,318
DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD

260
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,220
BETWEEN US ALL AS S. THAT I

261
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,122
WOULD HOPE AND I THINK WE

262
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:50,159
HAD SOME AGREEMENT BEFORE HA

263
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,327
THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN,

264
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,629
I THINK, JUSTIFIABLY

265
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:59,335
UNCOMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD

266
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:00,770
COULD PUBLICLY, IN AN EFFORT

267
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,271
TO BRING THIS COUNTRY

268
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:03,406
TOGETHER, SAY THAT WE WOULD

269
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:05,241
FEEL BETTER, I'M NOT

270
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,609
EXPECTING THEM TO VOTE YES,

271
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:08,311
BUT NOT TO COMPLAIN THAT AN

272
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:12,114
FBI INVESTIGATION HAS NOT

273
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:12,648
OCCURRED.

274
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:13,582
AND THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING

275
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:14,350
TO DO.

276
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,651
THIS COUNTRY IS BEING RIPPED

277
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:16,218
APART HERE.

278
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,654
AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE

279
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,222
THAT WE DO DUE DILIGENCE.

280
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,524
I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS

281
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:22,858
DONE A GOOD JOB, BUT I DO

282
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:27,230
THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE A

283
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,965
SHORT PAUSE AND MAKE SURE

284
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,501
THAT THE FBI CAN

285
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:31,901
INVESTIGATE.

286
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:32,669
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

287
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:33,970
SOME OF US WOULD HAVE TO AND

288
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,672
I'M PREPARED TO DO IT, MAKE

289
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,073
A REQUEST TO THE WHITE HOUSE

290
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:40,443
TO ASK THE FBI TO DO THAT

291
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:40,877
INVESTIGATION.

292
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:43,479
IT WOULD BE SHORT, AND

293
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,148
LIMITED IN SCOPE TO THE

294
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:45,782
CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT

295
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:47,650
HAVE BEEN MADE.

296
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,919
BUT, I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE

297
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,154
THE DEMOCRATS WHO WE TALKED

298
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,722
TO BEFORE TO ENDORSE THAT

299
00:09:52,722 --> 00:00:00,000
KIND OF THING, THAT WE CAN
