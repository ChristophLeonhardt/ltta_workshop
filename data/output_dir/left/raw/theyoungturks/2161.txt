1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,830
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN NEWS OF THE

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,080
BRIDGE COLLAPSE AT FLORIDA
INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,080
THEY

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
WERE BUILDING A BRIDGE.

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,340
IT WAS
950 TONS AND THEY CALLED IT AN

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,070
INSTANT BRIDGE WHILE THEY WERE
BUILDING IT, IT COLLAPSED ON

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,600
TRAFFIC THAT WAS ALLOWED TO PASS
UNDERNEATH IT AT THE TIME.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,190
THERE'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION
AS TO WHAT WENT ON.

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,190
MARCO RUBIO

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,090
TRYING TO CLARIFY THINK THINGS
LIKE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

11
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,660
TIGHTEN THE CABLES ON IT AND
THEY ORDERED SOMEONE TO TIGHTEN

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,240
IT BUT BEFORE THEY COULD BE
TIGHTENED THIS HAPPENS BUT THERE

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,270
IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

14
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,418
ONE OF THE COMPANIES BEHIND IT

15
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,510
MADE A STATEMENT IN THE WAKE OF
THE EVENT GOT IT IS CALLED FIGG

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,739
BRIDGE ENGINEERS.

17
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:43,339
THEY SAID:

18
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:56,170
IT 

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,770
LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY SOLID
APOLOGY BUT THERE WAS A BIT IN

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,190
THE MIDDLE THAT IN OUR 40 YEAR
HISTORY NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,570
HAPPENED.

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:31,060
BUT NEWS HAS SURFACED:

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,030
AS A RESULT THE FIRM WAS FINED
$20,000.

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,750
IT IS JUST WEIRD, IT IS A
FAMILY COMPANY, THAT YOU WOULD

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,700
MENTION THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
AS RECENTLY AS 2012.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,360
ALSO I THOUGHT I READ THAT
THEY PUT IT UP IN SIX HOURS AND

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,700
THAT THERE WAS PLANS NOT EVEN TO
HAVE THIS BRIDGE READY UNTIL

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,120
NEXT YEAR, SO WHAT IS THE RUSH?

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,530
WHAT IS THE PAYOFF?

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,300
IT IS A FOOTBRIDGE, GO AROUND.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,760
WHY WOULD THEY RISK PEOPLE'S
LIVES?

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,480
IT IS THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION
METHOD CALLED ACCELERATED

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,480
BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION.

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,240
ON NAME ALONE I VOTE NO.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,530
IT WAS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED IN
PART AT FIU WHICH IS WHY I

36
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,049
THINK THEY SAW THIS AS A
PUBLICITY OPPORTUNITY AND

37
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,151
IT WAS DEVELOPED WITH A COUPLE
OF OTHER UNIVERSITIES BUT

38
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:24,090
THE WHOLE IDEA IS A GOES UP IN
SIX HOURS AS OPPOSED TO

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,980
OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC FOR
24 OR NOT EVEN,

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,519
24 WEEKS OR HOWEVER LONG IT
TAKES TO BUILD A BRIDGE.

41
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,610
HERE WHEN THEY BUILT THE
BRIDGE OVER THE 405

42
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,200
IT SHUT DOWN TRAFFIC FOR LIKE
DAYS, ENTIRE DAYS AT A TIME.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
EXACTLY.

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,260
I AM NEVER DEFENDING ANYTHING
THEY DO TO ENHANCE THE 405 AND

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,190
NOT ANYWAY, BECAUSE THEY DID
THAT, IT DIDN'T COLLAPSE AND

46
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,080
PEOPLE DIDN'T DIE.

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,219
THAT LEADS TO
THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT WHICH

48
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,370
IS WE

49
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,400
HAVE TO CONSTANTLY DEFEAT THESE
RIGHT-WING MYTHOLOGIES AND SO

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,569
THEY SAY, REGULATION IS ALWAYS
BAD, IT SLOWS EVERYTHING DOWN.

51
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,640
YOU HAVE TO DEREGULATE.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,099
WELL,
IT KIND OF DEPENDS, DOESN'T IT

53
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,810
QUESTO IF THERE IS
OVERREGULATION, WHICH IS

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,849
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, THEN YES, YOU
SHOULD DEREGULATE A LITTLE BIT.

55
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,109
IF WALL STREET KEEPS CRASHING
THE ECONOMY, I WOULD STEP OF THE

56
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:19,620
REGULATION RATHER THAN STEP IT
DOWN AS AN EXAMPLE SAW IN

57
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,480
BRIDGES, LET'S KEEP THE
REGULATIONS UP BECAUSE IF

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,260
BRIDGES FALL THEN PEOPLE DIE AND
IT IS KIND OF A BAD IDEA.

59
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,629
BUILDINGS USED TO COLLAPSE ALL
OF THE TIME BACK IN THE DAY.

60
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:34,629
WE

61
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,299
DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BUILD THEM
TO BE EARTHQUAKE RESISTANT,

62
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,859
WHEN EARTHQUAKE HITS BUT WE
DID KNOW BUT THERE WERE NO

63
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,239
REGULATIONS ENFORCING IT SO IT
WAS CHEAPER TO BUILD A

64
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,570
BUILDING WITHOUT THOSE REQUIRED
REGULATIONS BUILT-IN.

65
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,810
ROLLERS ETC.

66
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,150
IT DOES COST MORE TO BUILD THE
BUILDING IN LA NOW, BECAUSE WHY?

67
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,180
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EARTHQUAKE,
YOU WERE SUPER PSYCHED THAT

68
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,049
THEY BUILT IT THAT WAY
BECAUSE WHEN THE 90

69
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,930
TON SLAB OF CONCRETE BALLS ON
YOUR HEAD, A KIND OF HURTS.

70
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,260
IT IS TERRIBLE.

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,769
MCM, THE
OTHER COMPANY THAT WAS INVOLVED

72
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,290
IN ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION SAID
THAT, OR WAS REPORTED THAT THEY

73
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,079
ALSO HAD 11 VIOLATION 620 13 AND
HAD BEEN FINED $50,000 OVER THAT

74
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,079
TIME.

75
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,209
THAT WAS REPORTED IN TIME
MAGAZINE THROUGH STATS FROM

76
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,639
OSHA.

77
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,550
ONE LAST WEIRD POINT I WANT
TO MAKE ON THE STORY.

78
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,710
WOLF PAC

79
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,090
IS AN ORGANIZATION TO GET MONEY
OUT OF POLITICS,

80
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,090
WOLF-PAC.COM/GO.

81
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,470
GET MONEY OUT
OF POLITICS.

82
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,300
ANYWAY, I AM SUPER

83
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,800
PROUD OF THE PEOPLE IN AND THERE
A LOT OF VETERANS IN THE GROUP

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT MAKES
SENSE, AND IT IS FIGHTING FOR

85
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,099
FREEDOM IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

86
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,479
THERE ARE A LOT OF TEACHERS IN

87
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:53,480
THE GROUP BECAUSE THEY FIND THAT
IT HELPS BECAUSE I GET

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,870
FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THEY WANT

89
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,000
TO KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,960
THEY
LOGICALLY FIGURE OUT THAT IT IS

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,270
MONEY IN POLITICS BUT THERE ARE
ALSO A LOT OF ENGINEERS AND I

92
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,430
TALKED TO A COUPLE OF ENGINEERS
IN A ROW COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

93
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,800
REMEMBER HAVING THIS
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

94
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,409
VOLUNTEERS AND I WAS LIKE WHAT
DREW YOU TO WOLFPAC?

95
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,409
ONE

96
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,610
OF THEM MADE A GREAT COMMENT
THAT I QUOTE FROM TIME TO TIME

97
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,610
ON THE SHOW.

98
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,530
YOU CANNOT HALF
BUILD A BRIDGE.

99
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,530
IF YOU ARE AN

100
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,300
ENGINEER YOU HAVE TO GET THE
BRIDGE HUNDRED PERCENT

101
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,870
RIGHT AND SO THEY THINK WOLFPACK
IS LOGICAL AND IT BRINGS

102
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,860
ALL THE WAY TO A MENU MEANT
THAT ACTUAL SOLVES A PROBLEM

103
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,880
WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO THEM TO
SAY THAT I WAS REMINDED OF

104
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,900
THAT READING THE STORY.

105
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,100
YOU CAN'T EVEN 99%
BUILT A BRIDGE.

106
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,289
IF YOU ARE AN ENGINEER YOU
HAVE TO GET A 100% RIGHT.

107
00:05:36,289 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS WHY REGULATIONS ARE
IMPORTANT IN CASES LIKE THIS.
