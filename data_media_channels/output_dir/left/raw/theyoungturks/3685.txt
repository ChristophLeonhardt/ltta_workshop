1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,370
SEVERAL POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS
OF THE MEDIA HAVE RESPONDED AND

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,959
SHARED THEIR OPINION IN REGARD
TO THE MASS SHOOTING THAT JUST

3
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:11,320
TOOK PLACE IN LAS VEGAS WHICH
KILLED 59 INDIVIDUALS AS OF

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,190
TODAY.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,950
I WANT TO START OFF WITH A
SPEECH THAT DONALD TRUMP

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,380
GAVE IN RESPONSE TO THIS
SHOOTING AND HOW HE FEELS

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,060
THAT NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO
UNITE AS A COUNTRY.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,500
TAKE A LOOK.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:30,349
WE ARE JOINED TOGETHER TODAY
IN SADNESS, SHOCK, AND GRIEF.

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:34,440
IT WAS AN ACT OF PURE EVIL.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,890
TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS,
WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU AND

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,940
WE ARE HERE FOR YOU.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:48,520
AND WE ASK GOD TO HELP SEE YOU
THROUGH THIS VERY DARK PERIOD.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,059
SCRIPTURE TEACHES US THE LORD IS
CLOSE TO THE BROKENHEARTED

15
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,739
AND SAVES THOSE WHO ARE CRUSHED
IN SPIRIT.

16
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,760
WE SEEK COMFORT IN THOSE WORDS,
FOR WE KNOW THAT GOD LIVES IN

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,250
THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO GRIEVE.

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,531
TO THE WOUNDED, WHO ARE NOW
RECOVERING IN HOSPITALS, WE

19
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:12,430
ARE PRAYING FOR YOUR AND SPEEDY
RECOVERY.

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,440
MELANIA AND I ARE PRAYING FOR
EVERY AMERICAN WHO HAS BEEN

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,040
HURT, WOUNDED, OR LOST THE ONES
THEY LOVE SO DEARLY IN THIS

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,320
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE ATTACK.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,340
WE PRAY FOR THE ENTIRE NATION TO
FIND UNITY AND PEACE AND WE PRAY

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,270
FOR THE DAY WHEN EVIL IS
BANISHED AND THE INNOCENT ARE

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,810
SAFE FROM HATRED AND FROM FEAR.

26
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,860
MAY GOD BLESS THE SOULS OF THE
LIVES THAT ARE LOST.

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,340
MAY GOD GIVE US THE GRACE OF
HEALING AND MAY GOD PROVIDE

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,290
THE GRIEVING FAMILIES WITH
STRENGTH TO CARRY ON.

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,790
THANK YOU.

30
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,930
GOD BLESS AMERICA.

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,450
THAT IS YOUR TELEPROMPTER
PRESIDENT.

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,460
HE COULDN'T QUOTE SCRIPTURE OFF
THE TOP OF THE SIDE OF HIS

33
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,950
LIFE DEPENDED ON IT SO HE IS
OBVIOUSLY READING FROM A

34
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,950
TELEPROMPTER.

35
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,950
WHAT DO THEY DO THAT?

36
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,100
IT SENSIBLE AND LOGICAL BECAUSE
GOD KNOWS WHAT DONALD TRUMP

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,560
WOULD SAY IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE
THEM A SCRIPT IN A

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,280
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,950
I'M SURE THERE WAS AN INTERNAL
MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE,

40
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,860
GET THAT GUY SCRIPT OTHERWISE HE
WILL SAY SOMETHING

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,060
DISASTROUS AT A HORRIBLE MOMENT
LIKE THIS.

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,250
SO HE GOES AND PRETENDS TO TALK
ABOUT GOD AND PRAYERS.

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,320
LET ME TRANSLATE FOR YOU.

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,840
WHENEVER YOU HEAR SOMEBODY
SAYING THAT THEY ARE GOING

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,280
TO PRAY ABOUT AN ISSUE,
POLITICIAN SAYING IT, THAT

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,740
MEANS I AM NOT GOING TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

47
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,160
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,170
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY HERE AND
PRAY.

49
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,200
THIS TRUMP SAY THAT IS AN ACT
OF TERRORISM, WELLNESS IS

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,070
RIGHT RING TERRORISM.

51
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,640
IF IT'S A MUSLIM RADICAL
TERRORISM TO SEE TRUMP

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,410
GOING, WE'RE GOING TO PRAYING
GOD LIVES IN THE HEARTS OF

53
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,430
THE GRIEVING VICTIMS SO WE'RE
JUST GOING TO PRAY ABOUT IT

54
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,430
NOT DOING ANYTHING.

55
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,630
NO, HE IS LIKE TRAVEL BAN,
BOMBINGS, WAY TO KILL THEM

56
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,610
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

57
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,920
NOW WHEN IT IS A MASS SHOOTING
AFTER MASS SHOOTING, 33,000

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,110
PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR FROM GUN
SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA ALL OF

59
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,110
A SUDDEN, PRAYERS.

60
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,110
ANOTHER WORDS, NOTHING.

61
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,850
I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY
POLICY ACTION.IN FACT I'M

62
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,110
GOING TO BLOCK POLICY ACTION AND
THEN FINALLY, GOOD VERSUS EVIL.

63
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,160
THAT WILL SOLVE IT.

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,880
THAT IS HOW SIMPLE MINDS THINK.

65
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,080
OH, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF
DIFFERENT FACTORS.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,850
ISSUES OF BACKGROUND
CHECKS.

67
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,410
IF IT WAS POLITICAL,
WHICH WE DON'T KNOW, THAT

68
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,410
WOULD BE A LEGITIMATE CONCERN.

69
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,620
IF IT'S A RELIGIOUS CONCERN IT
WOULD BE LEGITIMATE TO HAVE THAT

70
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,650
AS PART OF THE THINGS THAT YOU
LOOK AT TO SEE, HOW CAN WE

71
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,650
PREVENT THIS.

72
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,430
INSTEAD OF HAVING THAT
DISCUSSION, MIKA, THEM EVIL.

73
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,430
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

74
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,069
LEAVE IT UP TO GOD, WILL SEE
TOMORROW DON'S MOTHER WILL

75
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,500
BE ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING.

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,910
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PERSON
WHO IS FED UP WITH THIS

77
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,760
RESPONSE TO THESE SHOOTINGS.

78
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,790
THERE ARE SOME REPRESENTATIVES
IN CONGRESS WHO ARE

79
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,980
SPEAKING OUT AND THEY ARE
REFUSING TO LOOK TO GOD OR

80
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,780
TO PRAYER IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS
TYPE OF TRAGEDY OR PREVENT

81
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,370
IT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE.

82
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,070
REPRESENTATIVE SETH MOULTON FROM
MASSACHUSETTS ACTUALLY HAD

83
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,399
SOME PRETTY STRONG STATEMENTS IN
REGARD TO THIS.

84
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,958
HE SAID AFTER THE SHOOTING THAT
HAPPENED IN ORLANDO I WILL

85
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,910
NOT BE JOINING MY COLLEAGUES IN
A MOMENT OF SILENCE JUST

86
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,810
BECAUSE AN EXCUSE FOR INACTION.

87
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,880
NOW IS NOT THE MOMENT FOR
SILENCE, IT IS THE WOMAN

88
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,040
FOR ACTION.

89
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,230
THIS IS WHAT HE TWEETED JUST
AFTER THE SHOOTING AND I

90
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,780
THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES THAT ARE

91
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,010
TIRED OF THIS HAPPENING.

92
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,840
THAT YOU WANT SENSIBLE ACTION
TAKEN BY HER LAWMAKERS.

93
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,970
HE IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

94
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,970
I WILL GO FURTHER.

95
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,410
THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR
SCIENCE.

96
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,760
THIS IS A TIME FOR SHOUTING.

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,450
IF YOU ARE TIRED OF YOUR FELLOW
AMERICANS BEING BUTCHERED AND

98
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,540
THEY WERE, WE PLAYED THE VIDEO
IN THE LAST SEGMENT FOR YOU

99
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,640
GUYS IN THE LIVE SHOW AND IT
SOUNDED LIKE A WAR ZONE.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,110
A GUY WITH A FULLY AUTOMATIC
WEAPON JUST OPENING FIRE ON

101
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,440
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND SO FAR,
ONE PERSON DIED IN THE

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,590
MIDDLE OF THE LIVE
SHOW SO IT IS NOW 59

103
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,330
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD AND OVER 500
THAT ARE INJURED.

104
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,350
IS NOT TIME FOR SILENCE.

105
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,110
IT IS TIME TO SPEAK OUT ON THEIR
BEHALF AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

106
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,880
SPEAK OUT ON THE BEHALF OF THE
NEXT POTENTIAL VICTIMS SO THEY

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,730
DON'T BECOME VICTIMS SO THAT WE
CAN BEGIN TO FIX THIS ISSUE

108
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,100
AND OUR GUNS A PART OF THE
ISSUE?

109
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,040
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

110
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,250
WEAPONS LIKE THIS MAKE IT MUCH
EASIER TO DO MASS MURDER.

111
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,620
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND WITH A ROPE
AND KILL A LOT OF PEOPLE AT

112
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,980
ONE TIME THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT
WITH A KNIFE OR SCISSORS.

113
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,560
PEOPLE SAY SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO
IT WITH VEHICLES.

114
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,610
THAT IS TRUE.

115
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,440
SO IF THERE IS A GOOD WAY TO PUT
THE CONCRETE BARRIERS WERE A LOT

116
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,920
OF CIVILIANS ON THE SIDEWALK,
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT.

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,610
THAT IS A REASONABLE
CONVERSATION TO HAVE DONE

118
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,280
INSTEAD THEY GO NO, DON'T TALK
ABOUT IT I'VE ITS VEHICLES,

119
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,460
LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION BUT IF
I AM MAKING MONEY OFF OF

120
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,750
GUNS AND ALL OF THE REPUBLICAN
POLITICIANS DO MAKE MONEY.

121
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,500
THEY GET CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES
FROM THE NRA AND GUN

122
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,960
MANUFACTURERS SO THEY BENEFIT
PERSONALLY FROM THIS AND

123
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,470
POLITICALLY FROM THIS SO ALL OF
A SUDDEN, SILENCE.

124
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,530
SILENCE AND PRAYERS.

125
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,530
EXACTLY.

126
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,180
BY THE WAY, FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT
BE WATCHING WHO ARE VERY

127
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,660
PROTECTIVE OF THEIR GUN RIGHTS.

128
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,490
THEY DO WANT ANY GUN LEGISLATION
WHATSOEVER AND YOU DON'T

129
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,580
BUY THAT THESE POLITICIANS ARE
BOUGHT, KEEP IN MIND THAT

130
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,850
JUST THIS PAST FRIDAY, WE DID A
STORY ABOUT HOW THE TRUMP

131
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,800
ADMINISTRATION IS NOW MAKING
IT EASIER FOR WEAPONS

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,460
MANUFACTURERS HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES TO DIRECTLY SELL WEAPONS

133
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,009
TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES SOME OF
WHICH MAY BE OUR ADVERSARIES.

134
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,009
WHY IS THAT?

135
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,710
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO SELL
WEAPONS, NOT JUST GUNS, AND

136
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,310
TALKING SERIOUS MILITARY GRADE
WEAPONS I CAN CAUSE A LOT

137
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,870
OF HARM AND KILL A LOT OF
PEOPLE.

138
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,009
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO SELL THOSE
WEAPONS IF WE KNOW THEY ARE

139
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:08,450
LIKELY TO END UP IN THE HANDS OF
OUR ENEMIES?

140
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,110
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DO THAT?

141
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,360
WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS WANT THAT
THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY.

142
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,550
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT LIVES OF
PROTECTING AMERICANS.

143
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,010
THAT OKAY BUT THE CONSTITUTION
OR YOUR SAFETY OR ANY OF

144
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,490
THOSE ISSUES AT ALL.

145
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,449
THEY CARE ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND
SO TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO DO

146
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,450
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

147
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,930
THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A
SOLUTION.

148
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,889
WE'RE SITTING HERE GETTING ANGRY
BUT THIS IS THE SAME THING

149
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,840
THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH BEFORE
AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP

150
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,699
GOING THROUGH IT OVER AND OVER
AGAIN.

151
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,900
WHO NUZZLED THE DEATH TOLL IS
GOING TO BE.

152
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,240
IS BEYOND FRUSTRATING.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,440
WE BUILT THESE AMORAL MACHINES
CALLED PUBLIC CORPORATIONS

154
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,400
AND WE TOLD THEM WHATEVER YOU
DO, MAXIMIZE PROFIT.

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,410
IF YOU MAKE SNEAKERS, MAKE AS
MANY AS YOU CAN TYPE YOU

156
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,750
MAKE GUNS, MAKE AS MANY AS YOU
CAN DOCUMENT DRONES OR

157
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,960
TANKS OR KILLING MACHINES, MAKE
AS MANY KILLING MACHINES AS

158
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,169
YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

159
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,440
THEN WE TOLD THEM, IT'S OKAY TO
BRIBE POLITICIANS.

160
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,990
WE'RE GOING TO CALL IT CAMPAIGN
EXPENDITURES, CAMPAIGN

161
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,990
DONATIONS.

162
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,490
YOU CAN SPEND LOBBYIST MONEY,
THINK ABOUT THE DINNERS, ALL

163
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,630
THESE THINGS THAT TAKE THEM ON
VACATION DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

164
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,509
WE HAVE LEGALIZED BRIBERY AND
THEN WHAT WOULD A RATIONAL

165
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,789
AMORAL MACHINE DO?

166
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,050
THERE IN THE BUSINESS OF
