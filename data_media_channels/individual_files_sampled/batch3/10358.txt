Germany's decision to take in members of the controversial Syrian group the white helmets has sparked anger among lawmakers who say Berlin should be offering asylum to others instead I have decided that Germany will take in eight members of the white helmets aid group and their families and Grantham protection the continuing military offensive on the territorial gain the Syrian regime is making in southern Syria presents an acute danger for the group the federal government must offer asylum to the journalist and founder of the WikiLeaks whistleblowing platform Julian Assange instead of accepting members of the controversial white helmets group from Syria it is completely contradictory that the Interior Minister on the one hand wants to find Islamist terror but on the other wants to bring in these members of Islamist terrorist militias to Germany so their white helmets is a self-proclaimed a rescue group that's been operating in Syria for the last six years it's received millions in funding from a US and NATO allies the group sparked concern after that for example when they were filmed removing a body from a jihadist execution and another video seen waving al-qaeda flags there have been numerous allegations of the white helmets working directly with al-nusra terrorists and of staging rescue operations now as we just heard some German MPs would rather offer asylum to Julian Assange the founder or co-founder of WikiLeaks now Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after a Swedish Court issued an arrest warrant for him over allegations of rape and the whistleblowers lawyers say the allegations are politically motivated the UN has described his confinement at the Embassy as arbitrary detention now as for the white helmets whether or not to grant them asylum in Germany if certainly he has divided opinion David Nowak from the left party thinks it's odd they've been given priority Julian Assange faces to being prosecuted in Great Britain or maybe even in the United States and the German government doesn't say anything about him and latarian issues in that case but it wants to take in the refugees from Syria and against taking in the refugees from Syria but why'd those Syrians and why not others because there many Syrians barred and from leaving Turkey in order to come to to Europe and they are not allowed to but those white helmets who played a dubious role in the civil war and they are allowed into into Germany now and that's that's very strange they only operate in rebel-held territories and they're only and few moderate rebels left and many of those territories are dominated by Islamist groups and the what helmets are not impartial in that conflict they are clearly a part of a faction not of a moderate faction in the Syrian civil war and yeah that not a pure humanitarian organization meanwhile Assange is future remains unclear Ecuador is now reportedly considering withdrawing its asylum protection prompting fears he will face extradition to America where he faces prosecution over the leaking of classified documents let's recall some of those leaks I'm not a doctor but I think you're getting good medical care does the NSA collect any data and millions of neurons no sir WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service you you
