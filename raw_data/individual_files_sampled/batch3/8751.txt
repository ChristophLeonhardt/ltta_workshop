WE WILL PROVE TONIGHT WHY SHE IS ACTUALLY AN AMERICAN HERO. WE HAVE ALL OF THIS TONIGHT AND TONIGHT'S OPENING NEWS MONOLOGUE. ALL RIGHT, THEY HAVE BEEN PUT ON NOTICE, AMERICA WILL NO LONGER BE BOWING DOWN TO THEIR AGGRESSIVE TACTICS. THE DAYS OF BLINDLY TRUSTING AND TRYING TO BRIBE THIS ROGUE REGIME ARE NOW OVER. HOURS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE OF THE COURAGEOUS TO PULL THE UNITED STATES OUT OF THIS VERY FLAWED IRANIAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE. THE IRANIAN REGIME IS THE THE DEAL ALLOWED I RAN IT TO CONTINUE ENRICHING URANIUM AND OVERTIME, REACH THE BRINK OF A NUCLEAR BREAKOUT. THIS DISASTROUS DEAL GAVE THIS REGIME AND IT'S A REGIME OF GREAT TERROR. MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SOME OF IT IN ACTUAL CASH. TODAY, WE HAVE DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT THIS IRANIAN PROMISE WAS ALL A LIE. THEREFORE, I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL WITHDRAW FROM THE IRAN AT NUCLEAR DEAL. Sean: THANK GOD. NOW, NATURALLY, THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT, HE RESPONDED WITH THE THROAT SAYING THAT HIS ROGUE REGIME, THEY ARE READY TO START ENRICHING AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF URANIUM IF THE SECONDARY NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT YIELD POSITIVE RESULTS. NOW, THIS EXPRESSION MAY HAVE WORKED WITH OBAMA, BUT NOT ANYMORE. THIS IS A NEW AGE OF DIPLOMACY, BASED ON THE CONCEPT THAT REAGAN TAUGHT US. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. IT WORKS. WATCH THIS. AS WE EXIT TO THE IRAN DEAL, WE WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES TO FIND OUR REAL COMPREHENSIVE AND LASTING SOLUTION TO THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR THREAT. IN THE MEANTIME, POWERFUL SANCTIONS WILL GO INTO FULL EFFECT. IF THE REGIME CONTINUES ITS NUCLEAR ASPIRATIONS, IT WILL HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN IT HAS EVER HAD BEFORE. Sean: IT NOW, OF COURSE, IF IRAN IS SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING THE IMMEDIATELY HALTING THEIR EFFORS TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATES, THERE WOULD STILL BE TIME TO NEGOTIATE. MOST U.S. SANCTIONS WILL NOT BE REINSTATED FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS. OIL RELATED SANCTIONS WILL TAKE 180 DAYS TO COME ONLINE. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WILLING AND READY TO NEGOTIATE, JUST LIKE HE IS WITH LITTLE ROCKET MAN. TAKE A LOOK. BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE A NEW AND LASTING DEAL. ONE THAT BENEFITS ALL OF IRAN AND THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. WHEN THEY DO, I AM READY, WILLING, AND ABLE. GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR IRAN GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR IRA IRAN. AND GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR THE PEACE AND STABILITY THAT WE ALL WANT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. TO BE ONE ALL RIGHT, IT IS REALLY SIMPLE. IF IRAN WANTS HIS PEOPLE TO PROSPER WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF U.S. SANCTIONS, THEY JUST HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE. NOW, THE LEADERS OF IRAN, THEY ARE CORRUPT, THEY ARE IMMORAL, THEY ARE RADICAL. THIS IS A ROGUE THEOCRACY, AND THEIR SUFFERING PEOPLE KNEW HERE IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT VERY SUBJECT ALSO EARLIER TODAY IN THIS HISTORIC SPEECH. I WANT TO DELIVER A MESSAGE TO THE SUFFERING PEOPLE OF IRAN. THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA STAND WITH YOU. IT HAS NOW BEEN ALMOST 40 YEARS SINCE THIS DICTATORSHIP SEIZED POWER AND TOOK A PROUD NATION HOSTAGE. MOST OF IRAN'S 80 MILLION CITIZENS HAS SADLY NEVER KNOWN AND IRAN THAT PROSPERED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND DEMANDED THE JOHN CAREY OF COURSE HAS BEEN BUSY TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BY CONDUCTING A POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL SHUTTER DIPLOMACY. HE SAID THE IRAN DEAL MADE OUR ALLIES AGREE. RELEASED AN INCREDIBLY BORING A HOLIER THOU SANCTIMONIOUS STATEMENT CALLING THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION MISGUIDED. WE WILL SPARE YOU ALL THOSE BORING DETAILS. THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT NEED IT DIPLOMATIC INPUT FROM A PRESIDENT WHO OVERSAW THE COLLAPSE OF THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNFETTERED EXPANSION OF RUSSIAN AGGRESSION, AND A SITUATION ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA THAT WAS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. OH, AND HE GAVE THEM 150 BILLION. OF COURSE, WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE COMPLAINING, AMERICA'S CLOSEST ALLEY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ISRAEL, IS UNDER A DAILY IMMINENT THREAT FROM IRAQ. THEY ARE PLOTTING THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION. HERE'S WHAT THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PRESENT. FULLY SUPPORTS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS DECISION TODAY TO REJECT THE DISASTROUS NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN. I OPPOSED IT FROM THE START BECAUSE WE SAID THAT RATHER THAN BLOCKING IRAN, IT ACTUALLY PAVES THE WAY TO AN ENTIRE ARSENAL. ISRAEL THINKS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID A HISTORIC MOVE. AND THIS IS WHY ISRAEL THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP. HIS COMMITMENT TO CONFRONT THE TERRORIST REGIME IN IRAN, AND HIS COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT IT IRAN NEVER GETS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NOT TODAY, NOT IN THE DECADE, NOT EVER. Sean: IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK THAT THE PRIME MINISTER REVEALED IRAN'S NUCLEAR PLAN, CONTINUE TO DEVELOP A WEAPON SYSTEM THAT IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING NUCLEAR WARHEADS. STILL, WAY BEFORE HE WENT PUBLIC WITH THIS INTELLIGENCE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD PROMISED IT TO SCRAP WHAT A TERRIBLE DEAL HE HAD INHERITED. HE KEPT HIS PROMISE. WATCH THIS. MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO DISMANTLE THE DISASTROUS DEAL WITH IRAN. I HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS A LONG TIME, I KNOW DEALMAKING. AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS DEAL IS CATASTROPHIC. FOR AMERICA, FOR ISRAEL, AND FOR THE WHOLE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS WAS JUST PRIOR TO THE SIGNING OF THE IRAN DEAL, WHICH GIVE BACK TO IRAN $150 BILLION AND GAVE US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER NEGOTIATED. NEVER, EVER EVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN ANY TRANSACTION SO INCOMPETENTLY NEGOTIATED AS A DEAL WITH THE IRAN. AND I MEAN NEVER. Sean: NOT TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT IS FULFILLING THAT VERY IMPORTANT CAMPAIGN PROCESS AFTER YEARS OF BOWING DOWN TO DICTATORS, KISSING THEIR RINGS, ONCE AGAIN ON THE WORLD STAGE OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT IS THAT APPEASEMENT NEVER WORKS. YOU MAY REMEMBER NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN. HE WAS A BRITISH PRIME MINISTER, DECLARING PEACE AND OUR TIME AFTER CAVING IN DURING NEGOTIATIONS AFTER MEETING HITLER AND MUNICH. TAKE A LOOK. THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE PROBLEM, WHICH IS NOW BEEN ACHIEVED IS IN MY VIEW ONLY THE PRELUDE TO A LARGER SETTLEMENT IN WHICH ALL OF EUROPE MAY FIND
