00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
is the stock market<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to crash is</font>

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,899
this little bit of wavering that we've

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,240
seen the last few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks the start of a</font>

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,610
much bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> move Matthew The Economist</font>

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,889
recently said you know what stocks are

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,300
overvalued we're going to see him<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,299
down so is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start of that I</font>

8
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:16,049
think one of the things I've learned

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,550
over the years the economist is though

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,699
we're often right in our call it takes a

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,100
long time for the call actually to

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,330
affect what actually goes on the market

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,769
so I don't know whether what's happening

14
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,230
now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start of that correction but</font>

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,510
the underlying messages that I think

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,020
stocks look very expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> by you know</font>

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,850
all the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rules that historically</font>

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,739
we've used to judge them and I've

19
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,690
written<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a lot of bubbles over the</font>

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,879
years and I've been I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think right in the</font>

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,670
end one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason we wrote the road</font>

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,110
from ruin was we want to learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,300
these bubbles that do happen and we did

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,219
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of I had a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of experience</font>

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,219
i remember back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> late 1990s when</font>

26
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,140
people were saying the Dow should be at

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,660
36,000 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Economist was you know</font>

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,550
wrong to say there was a bubble then and

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,219
I think what's happened now is that

30
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,349
you've had you know the inevitable

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,290
rebound from the credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> crunch effect on</font>

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,390
the market and that's been good there

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">should have been a bounce back in the</font>

34
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,650
stock market but fundamentally you know

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,600
that then a lot of liquidity came into

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,890
the system and I think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have just</font>

37
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,659
rode them and then rode the momentum

38
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">anest led us to a point where the share</font>

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,460
prices do that very high at moment so if

40
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> economist in you are right about</font>

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,610
this what are we looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

42
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,530
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a garden-variety ten to</font>

43
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,909
twenty percent pullback we looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,729
catastrophic collapse to new lows I mean

45
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,290
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's any reason</font>

46
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,570
why it should go anywhere near where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

47
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,310
lows were in this crisis because that

48
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,439
was due to a lot of very artificial

49
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,090
forces affecting the market due to the

50
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,490
crisis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the way the everyone panicked</font>

51
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,100
so you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're going to</font>

52
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,799
look at that kind of return to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to where</font>

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,259
we were but i think we are you know

54
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,670
we're either going to see things just be

55
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,070
very flat and do go nowhere for several

56
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,770
years or we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see a correction</font>

57
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,170
that term<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know gets you better</font>

58
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,700
position which does make more sense it

59
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,860
often though it seems that the market

60
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,770
just tends to sort of fade out and

61
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Plateau especially after bubbles like</font>

62
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,890
yes certainly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look in 1973-74</font>

63
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,410
it's exactly what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan</font>

64
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Benjamin classically so so I wake up</font>

65
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,360
this morning and I see Goldman Sachs

66
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,280
kindly telling me not to worry about

67
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,050
stock prices because in fact they're

68
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,850
cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> because interest rates are low</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

69
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,160
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 18 times forward operating</font>

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,680
earnings why have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you concluded that</font>

71
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,720
stocks are expensive well one of the

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,280
fundamental worries that we have is that

73
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,450
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going on in the capital</font>

74
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,920
markets at the moment is the result of

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,550
this attempt to a successful attempt to

76
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,710
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the financial markets collapsing</font>

77
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,000
completely in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aftermath of the</font>

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,110
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Lehman Brothers so</font>

79
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,030
governments around the world have pumped

80
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,880
so much money into the system to support

81
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,510
the banks that that they can't keep on

82
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,790
pumping in and so at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

83
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,500
something's gotta give and you know a

84
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money was supposed to go to</font>

85
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,700
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately benefit the real</font>

86
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,620
economy through lending but in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

87
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,060
ended up going into speculation

88
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,800
particular our commodities but also

89
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,040
stock prices and if governments are

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,209
running out of capacity to borrow and

91
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,530
pump money into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> financial system and</font>

92
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">so at some point the money is going to</font>

93
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,670
have to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the system again and</font>

94
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,230
that fundamentally is when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

95
00:03:24,230 --> 00:00:00,000
bubble will burst
