JILLIAN: GOOD MONDAY MORNING,
CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY RACE IS
TOMORROW AND DEMOCRATS ARE
BECOMING MORE CONCERNED THAT
THEIR WIDE CANDIDATE FIELD WILL
HURT CHANS IN KEY CONGRESSIONAL
RACES, ARE THEY RIGHT TO WORRY?
PUBLISHER, SCOTT HIMSELF, THANK
YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
JILLIAN: ARE DEMOCRATS TO WORRY
IN CALIFORNIA?
>> ABOUT A COUPLE OF DISTRICTS
IN PARTICULAR.
THREE DISTRICTS IN ORANGE COUNTY
AREA WON BY HILLARY CLINTON IN A
NORMAL SITUATION AND NORMAL
STATE, YOU WOULD SAY THESE ARE
GOOD PICK-UP OPPORTUNITIES AND
DEMOCRATS NEED TO PICK UP SEATS
TO WIN CONTROL BUT BECAUSE
CALIFORNIA IS NOT A NORMAL
STATE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A
REALLY SILLY ELECTION LAW, THEY
MIGHT NOT HAVE A CANDIDATE ON
THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER.
JILLIAN: EXPLAIN THAT.
>> JUNGLE PRIMARY SYSTEM,
EVERYBODY FROM BOTH PARTIES IS
THROWN ON THE BALLOT TOMORROW IN
CALIFORNIA AND TOP TWO WINNERS
REGARDLESS OF PARTY GO FORWARD.
IF YOU HAVE A DISTRICT, LET'S
SAY 40% OF THE VOTE GOES TO
REPUBLICANS AND THERE'S ONLY TWO
REPUBLICANS THAT GET ABOUT 20%
EACH, EVEN IF THE DEMOCRATS GET
THE OTHER 60% OF THE VOTE, IF
THEY HAVE 8 OR 10 CANDIDATES
THEY ALL MIGHT BE LEFT OUT
BECAUSE THEY ARE SPLITTING THE
VOTE.
JILLIAN: SEEMS LIKE AN
INTERESTING WAY TO DO THINGS.
>> INTERESTING IS A GOOD WORD.
JILLIAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT PLACES
TO WATCH IN CALIFORNIA.
>> 39, 48 AND 49.
THREE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICTS.
IN EACH CASE IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN
THERE WOULD BE ONE REPUBLICAN IN
THE RUNNING.
IN TWO OF THE THREE YOU HAVE
REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT ANNOUNCED
THE PERSON THEY WOULD LIKE TO
SEE SUCCEED THEM AND EVERYBODY
ELSE IN TOSS UP FOR SECOND
PLACE.
WE HAD THIS MANY CANDIDATES,
YOU'RE LIKELY HAVE A WINNER
MAYBE WIN 25% AND THE SECOND
PERSON WITH 15 OR 16%.
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE, JILLIAN,
IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE 16
CANDIDATES, IF YOU HAD MORE
FRIENDS AND GOT THEM TOUT POLLS,
YOU WILL PULL OUT VICTORY.
JILLIAN: SO POPULAR.
CANDIDATE OVERLOAD.
>> IN CALIFORNIA 17 CANDIDATES.
JILLIAN: WHOA.
>> WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HERE
IS WHAT THE SPLIT IS, HOW MANY
ARE SERIOUS CANDIDATES.
THE REASON THERE'S CONCERN AMONG
DEMOCRATS IS THE REPUBLICANS
HAVE GOOD SOLID CANDIDATES WITH
POLITICAL RESUMES WHO ARE KNOWN
IN THE DISTRICTS WHO ARE LIKELY
TO DOMINATE THE REPUBLICAN
VOTERS AND DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE
THAT LEVEL.
THE OTHER ISSUE TO WATCH FOR IN
THE RACES IS HEAVY ASIAN
AMERICAN PRESENCE AND THE ASIAN
AMERICAN COMMUNITY TYPICALLY HAS
VOTED REPUBLICAN AT THE LOCAL
LEVEL BUT THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR
DONALD TRUMP.
JILLIAN: INTERESTING.
TALK NUMBERS.
10 HOUSE SEATS UP FOR GRABS IN
CALIFORNIA, WHAT DO THOSE
NUMBERS SAY?
>> CALIFORNIA IS VITALLY
IMPORTANT STATE FOR THE
DEMOCRATS.
THIS OTHER THAN PENNSYLVANIA
THERE'S NO PLACE WHERE THEY CAN
PICK UP MORE GROUND, IF THEY
FORFEIT SOME OF THE SEATS, THEIR
CHANCES OF WINNING CONTROL GOES
AWAY.
RIGHT NOW WE ESTIMATE 31
COMPETITIVE RACES, DEMOCRATS
HAVE TO WIN 24 OUT OF 31 TO WIN
CONTROL.
WELL, IF THEY DO THAT, THEY WIN
BUT IF THEY GIVE AWAY TWO OR
THREE SEATS BECAUSE OF JUNGLE
PRIMARY, NOW YOU HAVE TO WIN 24
OUT OF 28.
JILLIAN: CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT
THAT SAY THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS
LEAD BY ONLY 3.2 POINTS WHICH
HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE.
>> YEAH.
JILLIAN: WHY DO YOU THINK THIS
IS?
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE ELECTION
AND HILLARY CLINTON IN MY
OPINION SO FOCUSED ON DONALD
TRUMP INSTEAD OF SO FOCUSED ON
HER CAMPAIGN IT SEEMS LIKE THAT
STILL WAS GOING ON.
>> RIGHT.
DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE REMARKABLE
JOB OF GETTING EVERYBODY TO TALK
ABOUT HIM AND GETTING DEMOCRATS
SO OBSESSED TO TALK ABOUT HIM.
JILLIAN: IS THAT WHY?
>> ONE PART OF IT.
LAST DECEMBER JUST BEFORE TAX
REFORM PASSED DEMOCRATS HAD
13-POINT EDGE.
REPUBLICANS CUT TAXES ALL OF A
SUDDEN -- JILLIAN: SOMEONE IS
TRYING TO REACH YOU.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THEY ARE VOTING
FOR ME TOMORROW.
WHAT HAPPENED BACK HERE WAS WE
HAD -- REPUBLICANS DID SOMETHING
TO ENERGIZE THEIR BASE, THEY
JUMP-STARTED THE ECONOMY AND
THAT'S A BIG REASON.
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT GENERIC
BALLOT IF ON ELECTION DAY IT'S
3, 4, 5 POINTS IN DEMOCRATIC
FAVOR IT'S GOING TO BE A
TOSS-UP.
DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN SEAT BUT WE
DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO WIN
