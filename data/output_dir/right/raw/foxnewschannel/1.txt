LADIES, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

9
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,155
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HEARD

10
00:00:13,156 --> 00:00:15,157
A LOT OF VOICES IN THE LAST

11
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:17,059
72 HOURS OR SO WHERE PEOPLE

12
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,927
SAY WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE

13
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:20,462
SOMEBODY HAS MAILED THESE

14
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,730
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.

15
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:22,531
AND YOU CAN BLAME DONALD

00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,733
TRUMP FOR HIS RHETORIC.

17
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,435
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO

18
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,636
UNDERSTAND THIS IS HOW THE

19
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:28,170
LEFT OPERATES.

20
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:31,006
WHAT THEY DO IS TRY TO PLACE

21
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:32,775
BLAME INSTEAD OF BLAMING

22
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:33,175
THEMSELVES.

23
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:33,876
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY DIDN'T

24
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:35,411
WANT TO ACCEPT THE OUTCOME

25
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:36,178
OF THE ELECTION.

26
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,446
WHEN THEY GOT ON THE STREETS

27
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:39,214
AND MARKED WITH THOSE LITTLE

28
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:42,384
WITH USE HATS ON INSTEAD OF

29
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:43,652
GOING TO THE POLLS.

30
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:45,621
ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY

31
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:46,889
SAID HARASS TRUMP

32
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,490
SUPPORTERS, KICK THEM WHEN

33
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:49,324
THEY ARE LOW.

34
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:50,459
BOMB THE WHITE HOUSE.

35
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,894
SEE, WHATEVER YOU PUT OUT IS

36
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:53,562
GOING TO COME BACK TO YOU.

00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,697
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

38
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:56,065
>> SO YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

39
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,901
THIS IS MERELY FEAR TACTIC

40
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:00,069
BEING USED TO CAUSE CHAOS

41
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,769
AND CONFUSION.

42
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,173
I NEED FOR PEOPLE TO RISE

43
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:04,773
ABOVE IT.

44
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,475
GO TO THE POLLS, VOTE RED

45
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:08,043
AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.

46
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:08,711
STEVE: LADIES, THE PRESIDENT

47
00:01:08,712 --> 00:01:09,578
OF THE UNITED STATES HAS

48
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,380
USED TOUGH RHETORIC.

49
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:12,715
>> HA HA HA HA.

50
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:14,283
>> HOLD ON.

51
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:14,950
BECAUSE, THEY HAVE BEEN

52
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:19,488
DOING THIS TO OUR PRESIDENT

53
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,023
BEFORE HE EVEN BECAME

54
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:21,390
PRESIDENT.

55
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,624
WHEN HE THREW HIS HAT IN THE

56
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,660
RING, NOT EVEN A DAY LATER

57
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,896
THEY STARTED CALLING HIM

58
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:29,798
THESE DEROGATORY NAMES, 9.9%

59
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,734
OF THE LEFT WING NEWS IS

60
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:33,168
NEGATIVE TOWARD THIS

61
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:34,336
PRESIDENT AND TOWARDS THIS

62
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:34,770
COUNTRY.

63
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,538
OUR PRESIDENT ONLY HITS YOU

64
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,773
BACK TWO TIMES WHENEVER YOU

65
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,575
HIT HIM BACK THE FIRST TIME.

66
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,009
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

67
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,945
STEVE: THE COUNTER PUNCHER.

68
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:43,479
AINSLEY: SO, LADIES.

69
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,747
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

70
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,081
AINSLEY: WHAT'S THE SOLUTION

71
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:47,649
TO THIS, THIS POLITICAL

72
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,684
SEASON BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER

73
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:49,485
WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE

74
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:49,952
THIS.

75
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:52,354
BUT, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION TO

76
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:52,921
THIS?

77
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:53,655
BECAUSE IF YOU DISAGREE WITH

78
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,690
THE RIGHT, THE LEFT HATES

79
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,457
THE RIGHT.

80
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,959
THE RIGHT HATES THE LEFT.

81
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,727
WHAT DO WE DO AS A COUNTRY?

82
00:01:58,728 --> 00:01:59,995
>> WELL, WE ARE GOING TO

83
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:01,230
HAVE TO STOP HATING EACH

84
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:01,530
OTHER.

85
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,030
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

86
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:03,132
>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

87
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,466
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT

88
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,300
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS YOUR

89
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:05,667
PRESIDENT.

90
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,468
>> YES.

91
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:07,736
>> HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF

92
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:08,837
THE UNITED STATES IS WHAT WE

93
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,038
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT.

94
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,273
ONCE THEY CAN ACCEPT THAT

95
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:12,975
THEN WE CAN MOVE OUR COUNTRY

96
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:13,308
FORWARD.

97
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:13,776
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

98
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:15,010
>> THE LEFT IS GOING TO HAVE

99
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,479
TO STOP WITH THIS

100
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,847
FOOLISHNESS, CHAOS,

101
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:19,848
CONFUSION, FEAR.

102
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,816
YOU ARE PUTTING IT IN THE

103
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:21,784
MINDS OF THE AMERICAN

104
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:22,117

105
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:24,386
IF YOU ARE REALLY AMERICAN

106
00:02:24,387 --> 00:02:24,720
PEOPLE.

107
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,255
IF THE LEFT WING MEDIA

108
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,256
REALLY CARED ABOUT THE

109
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:28,791
AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU WOULD

110
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,225
NOT CAUSE CHAOS AND

111
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,093
CONFUSION WHEN IT COMES TO

121
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:46,408
LITTLE.
