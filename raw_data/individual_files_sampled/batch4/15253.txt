so where we at we're at a place where the basic foundations of anglo-american law have been tossed out the window for the sake of political convenience I say we toss them right back in and we toss out the SOPs who don't want to honor our traditions this is take that with Curt Schlichter regardless of what happens with judge Kavanagh and this is just a short-term thing which makes it even worse we have a bunch of senators a bunch of high-level Democratic officials who want to throw out the foundations of anglo-american jurisprudence they hate the idea of cross-examination they hate the idea of the presumption of innocence yet those two things are the key components of how we discover truth within the anglo-american system this isn't a new development put a witness on the stand and cross-examining her is not some so out-of-this-world notion a crazy talk it is the it is the heart and soul of how we discover the truth the perception of innocence the idea that a mere accusation is not enough that you requires evidence that the burden of proof is on the person asserting the accusation has been key to how we how we interact and how we settle disputes and how we punish crimes for almost a thousand years and yet they want to just toss it out just toss it out what accusation is enough an accusation is enough well I call that McCarthyite but that's an insult to Joe McCarthy because there actually were commies look you know you you get idiots like Maisie I don't expect idiots like mazie Hirono to do anything but I I don't I expect nothing from her because she's a rock she's just dumb as a post Richard Blumenthal faked valor guy the guy who is totally in name except of course he wasn't I don't expect much from him chris coons i expect a little more from but that a comes out and he says well you know if you're accused you have to prove your innocence since when what the hell is that who the hell thinks like that well I'll tell you Democrats because the the presumption of innocence the right to cross-examine the witnesses there's nothing wrong with them the thing that Democrats object to is that they are doing their job okay cross-examination is designed to uncover the truth it is designed when wielded by a zealous advocate to break down a story and show that the person telling it is not telling the truth and if you can't shake them on cross-examination that's pretty good yeah that's pretty good evidence that they are telling the truth no I I know this stuff I I do it as a lawyer I have to be a zealous advocate it's actually in the law it's written in there you must zealously advocate for your client so my job is to go in there and show that the other side is not telling you the truth and the presumption of innocence plays into this in an important way because it requires that the accuser whether it's an individual or the state make its case you don't have to you don't have to defend yourself against will of the wisps against fog against phantoms you you you get to hear the charges against you you get to hear the evidence against you and you get to put up your own case and challenge there's the Democrats aren't mad because cross-examination doesn't work they aren't mad because the presumption of innocence is unfair they're mad because cross-examination does work they are mad because the presumption of innocence is fair and this gets in the way of what they want what they want is to stop red Cavanaugh and they don't care how it hurts him they don't care how it hurts his family they don't care that it deprives the the tens of millions of voters who elected Donald Trump with the idea that he would appoint conservative Supreme Court justices that it that it strips them of their ability to have their say they don't care that's why they're against it they're not against they're not against cross-examination they're not against the presumption of innocence because these are ineffective it's exactly the opposite they are against them because they are tools of justice that prevent the kind of miscarriage of justice that these people are attempting to pull off on judge Cavanaugh and on the American people they're not getting away with it we're not gonna let them we're gonna stand up for a thousand years of anglo-american jurisprudence and tradition of the in of the right of an individual to face his accuser to know the charges against them and to force those accusing him to prove their case not prove your innocence I know it's really annoying to judge Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court too bad we are not throwing out the foundations of our system of government just because you're sad cuz you lost again if you want to see more of me you can follow me on twitter at kurt
