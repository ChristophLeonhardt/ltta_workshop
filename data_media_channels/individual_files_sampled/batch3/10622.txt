well as the Iran protests started to get more international attention some posts on social media spread rapidly despite being proven as fakes this tweet for example shows a photo of a woman hitting police officers with the caption Iran but it turned out to be a screenshot from an Iranian movie after being exposed the man who posted it claimed it was supposed to be symbolic and then a video which gained thousands of views was said to show a march in Iran and that was later proved to be of a protest in Bahrain from 2011 other fakes were probably less clear including this post here which claimed to show the uprising when it was actually a photo of a pro-government rally
