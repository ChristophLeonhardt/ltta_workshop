00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,620
I'm Kim Bhasin, Luxury
Reporter at Bloomberg,

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,520
here to invite you into
the most exclusive realms

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,703
of luxury retail.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,463
This is Invitation Only.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,580
Today, I'm on 5th Avenue,

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,020
smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,620
This place is a luxury playground.

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,450
You got Bergdorf Goodman,
Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada,

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,480
Omega, Dolce & Gabbana,
Armani, Harry Winston.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,830
And the reason I'm here today

11
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,413
to see the most famous
jewelry store in the world:

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,423
Tiffany.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,220
The main floor of
Tiffany is great and all,

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,450
but that's not why I'm here.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,890
I've come to check out
their super secret salon.

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,363
A private area for their
fanciest clientele.

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,303
Hi, Kim.

18
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,136
Hello!

19
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,190
Welcome to the Tiffany
salon. Good to see you.

20
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,963
So, here we are, up on the
mezzanine of the New York store.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,170
We developed this area really
for our very best customers

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,180
to show wonderful jewelry.

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,733
We can work with them on
incredible custom designs.

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,840
Are there items available
up here that you can't get

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,050
down on the main floor?

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,050
Yes, there are.

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,113
We have a specifically
curated assortment up here.

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,650
This is a brand new
collection we've just launched

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,560
called Paper Flowers.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,450
And this is a combination
of using platinum, diamonds,

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,283
and tanzanites.

32
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:44,750
But the tanzanites are
all gradated colors.

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,743
So, it gives this lovely
three-dimensionality to it.

34
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,830
These are rare
fancy-colored diamonds, Kim.

35
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,160
A lot of people think that
diamonds, it's all to do with

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,520
colorless or lack of color.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,820
But this is at the other
end of the spectrum.

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,810
You have a rainbow of colors

39
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,710
that are the rarest of the rare.

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,850
Oh my goodness.

41
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,710
That diamond is enormous!

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,020
It's incredible.

43
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,600
This is a 28-carat.

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,433
28?

45
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,490
28.

46
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,010
That's hefty.

47
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,520
It's a hefty diamond.

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,440
It's a D color. The very, very top grade.

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,650
And internally flawless.

50
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,050
Absolutely no inclusions, incredibly pure.

51
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,912
How much would something
like that run for?

52
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:31,095
This one is a little over
four million dollars.

53
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:32,464
Eh, alright.

54
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:34,200
Can I try that on?

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,110
Oh, absolutely!

56
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,613
You have to try it on.
It's quite incredible.

57
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,900
It fits you perfectly.

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,780
Yeah, right.

59
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,484
And look at the beauty of the cut.

60
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,980
The sparkle, the radiance, the brilliance,

61
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,420
the purity of it, the transparency of it.

62
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,740
For a nice affordable
four million dollars.

63
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,573
Exactly.

64
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,406
Great.

65
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,190
Why do you like gemstones so much?

66
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,970
It's awesome and shiny?
Or, like, what's the deal?

67
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,110
Oh no, I mean, gemstones are incredible.

68
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,439
There's so many varieties.
There's so many differentials.

69
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,530
To this day, I find things and see things

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,159
that really blow my mind,
because you can't imagine

71
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,543
that mother nature can make
such extraordinary things.

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,480
We have a wonderful Tiffany
workshop here on the 10th floor,

73
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,690
which many people don't realize.

74
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,100
There, our finest high jewelry is made.

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,410
These are all completely handmade pieces

76
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,770
from beginning to end.

77
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,410
Many of the pieces you
see in the salon here

78
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,543
will be made at the Tiffany workshop.

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,700
There are various
experiences in this store

80
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,780
that aren't just going up to a counter

81
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,620
and picking something out and buying it.

82
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,453
Yeah.

83
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:53,560
Why is that important for a retailer?

84
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,690
Incredibly important these days.

85
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,933
I mean, as we all know, so
much shopping is done online.

86
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Customers can come in here
and they can walk around

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,190
and they can experience many things.

88
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,170
They can buy something, they
can dream about something.

89
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,270
But while they're here,
there's places to relax.

90
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,470
The Blue Box Cafe to
have something to eat.

91
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,160
So, you can really spend the day here.

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,519
That's really important,

93
00:04:18,519 --> 00:00:00,000
because it's a wonderful experience.
