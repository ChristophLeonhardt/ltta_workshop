I MEANT IT NOW.

2
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:05,286
I APOLOGIZE TO MY FAMILY.

13
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:19,834
YESTERDAY.

14
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:20,835
FIRST HE TALKS ABOUT NOT

15
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:22,470
NEEDING TO APOLOGIZE TO

16
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,837
MONICA.

17
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:24,272

00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:25,473
ALL FEEL SORRY FOR HIM FOR

19
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:26,440

00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,008
THESE YEARS.

21
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:28,442
AND GOES ON TO SAY THAT

22
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:30,611
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PARTLY TO

23
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,379
BLAME FOR THE COLLATERAL

24
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:31,712
DAMAGE.

25
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:32,880
I GUESS TO QUOTE HILLARY

26
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,681
CLINTON'S BOOK TITLE, WHAT

27
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:34,815
HAPPENED IN THIS INTERVIEW?

28
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:36,851
>> THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

29
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:38,286
YOU SEE BILL CLINTON THERE

30
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:40,621
WHO IS THE POSTER BOY OF THE

31
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,589
ME TOO MOVEMENT.

32
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:43,057
HE REPRESENTS A GROUP OF

33
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:45,893
ELITE MEN WHO PREY ON

34
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:47,328
UNSUSPECTING WOMEN LIKE

35
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:48,729
22-YEAR-OLD MONICA LEWENSKI.

36
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,498
SHE WAS AN INTERN.

37
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:51,365
THIS RUINED HER LIFE.

38
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,968
SHE CALLED HERSELF THE MOST

39
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:54,669
HUMILIATED WOMAN IN THE

40
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:56,537
WORLD.

41
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,239
IT STALLED HER LIFE FOR

42
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:58,940
DECADES.

43
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,474
SHE CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE.

44
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:01,943
JUMPING OFF A BALCONY IT

45
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:02,610
DESTROYED HER.

46
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,413
AND FOR BILL CLINTON TO SIT

47
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:08,249
THERE, AN EGOTISTICALLY

48
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:09,317

HELOST $16 MILLION SHE LOST

55
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:13,321
PART OF HER LIFE.

56
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:13,888
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

57
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:15,323
TO CLAIM HE IS ARE THE PA OF

58
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:17,191
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IT'S AN

59
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,826
INSULT TO WOMEN.

60
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:20,294
ABBY: BILL CLINTON USED TO

61
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,529
BE THE MOST POPULAR

62
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:22,163
POLITICIAN IN THE WORLD.

63
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,664
HE WAS KNOWN FOR ABILITY TO

64
00:01:23,664 --> 00:01:25,066
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE.

65
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:25,766
HIS EMPATHY.

66
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:27,201
HE GOES ON LAST NIGHT TO SAY

67
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:28,636
HE WAS THROWN OFF BY THAT

68
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:29,003
QUESTION.

69
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:29,904
IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO

70
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:30,938
HANDLE AN INTERVIEW AND

71
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:32,006
HANDLE A SIMPLE QUESTION

72
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:32,406
LIKE THAT.

73
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:33,441
IT WOULD BE BILL CLINTON.

74
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,542
HOW DOES ANYONE DEFEND IT?

75
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,110
>> I AGREE THERE YOU KNOW,

76
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,745
YOU CAN'T DEFEND THE

77
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:38,179
INDEFENSIBLE.

78
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,180
HE WENT AHEAD AND HE SAID

79
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,650
THAT HE GOT HOT UNDER THE

80
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,884
COLLAR ANSWERED BASICALLY

81
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:44,452
WHAT HE SAYS.

82
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:45,786
HE KNOWS WHAT HE SAID ON THE

83
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,154
LEFT OR RIGHT SIDE OF THE

84
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:47,989
AISLE HIS COMMENTS ARE

85
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:48,923
SOMETHING THAT REALLY GOT

86
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,091
PEOPLE IN AN UPROAR.

87
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,125
WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

88
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,493
HERE IS WHEN IT COMES TO

89
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:53,594
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ISSUES OF

90
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:55,096
THIS NATURE, IT'S NOT

91
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:55,696
POLITICAL ISSUE.

92
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,598
AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT

93
00:01:57,598 --> 00:02:00,067
CAILEE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF

94
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:01,736
UNDER THE COLLAR AROUND

95
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:02,603
CLINTON'S COMMENTS.

96
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,739
LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT WE

97
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,439
CURRENTLY HAVE SOMEONE

98
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,941
SITTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE

99
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:07,742
1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WHO

100
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:09,342
HAS ACCUSERS WHO SAY THE

101
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:09,943
SAME THING.

102
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:11,512
SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

103
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:12,413
ABBY: YOU ARE DOING EXACTLY

104
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:13,314
WHAT BILL CLINTON DID IN

105
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:13,781
THAT INTERVIEW.

106
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:14,682
>> NO I'M NOT.

107
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,550
DON'T DO THAT ABBY.

108
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,353
I'M NOT -- THAT'S RUDE.

109
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:20,087
ABBY: EVERY TIME WE HAVE YOU

110
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,288
ON THE SHOW YOU TURN IT BACK

111
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:21,789
TO DONALD TRUMP.

112
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:22,423
IN THIS CONVERSATION AND

113
00:02:22,423 --> 00:02:23,591
THAT INTERVIEW THAT HAPPENED

114
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:24,458
YESTERDAY ON "THE TODAY

115
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,659
SHOW" WITH BILL CLINTON

116
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,794
HIMSELF, THAT HAD NOTHING TO

117
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:27,528
DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.

118
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,730
THAT HAD TO DO WITH BILL

119
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,498
CLINTON'S PAST AND WHETHER

120
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,066
OR NOT HE FELT HE NEEDED TO

121
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,401
PERSONALLY APOLOGIZE TO

122
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,201
MONICA LEWENSKI.

123
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,070
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

124
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,670
DONALD TRUMP HERE.

125
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,738
WHEN YOU GO THAT DIRECTION

126
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:39,340
THAT IS WHAT TURNS A LOT OF

127
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,608
PEOPLE OFF.

128
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:41,842
KAYLEIGH, WHY DOES IT ALWAYS

129
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:42,543
GO BACK TO DONALD TRUMP.

130
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:44,912
>> RIDICULOUS TO TRY TO DRAW

131
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:47,615
AN ANALYSIS BETWEEN BILL

132
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,817
CLINTON WHO OVAL OFFICE AND

133
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,585
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WORDS IS

134
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:52,186
ASTONISHING.

135
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,021
SO-CALLED ACCUSERS BY THE

136
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,523
WAY JOHN SOLOMON AT THE HILL

137
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,158
REPORTED WERE PAID OFF BY

138
00:02:57,158 --> 00:02:57,858
GLORIA ALL RED.

139
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,693
ONE HAD HER MORTGAGE PAID

140
00:02:59,693 --> 00:02:59,960
OFF.

141
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,895
ANOTHER ONE OFFERED PAYMENTS

142
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:01,729
FROM A TABLOID.

143
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:03,064
TO SAY DRAW AN ANALOGY

144
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:03,998
BETWEEN WHAT WAS A PUBLICITY

145
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,067
STUNT AND THE SERIOUS

146
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,201
ALLEGATIONS BY JUANITA

147
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,369
BRODERICK AND PAULA JONES

148
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:10,271
AND MONICA LEWENSKI WHO

149
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,439
ALMOST JUMPED OFF OF A

150
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,573
BALCONY BECAUSE OF WHAT BILL

151
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:13,641
CLINTON DID TO HER IN THE

152
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,242
OVAL OFFICE, NOT AN ANALOGY

153
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,911
THERE WE SHOULD ALL SIT HERE

154
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,112
AND CONDEMN BILL CLINTON FOR

155
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,547
THOSE ACTIONS.

156
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,748
ABBY: WENTY, THE REASON I'M

157
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:22,016
FIRED UP BY THE WAY IS

158
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:22,883
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL WOMEN IN

159
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:23,851
THIS CONVERSATION.

160
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:24,685
THE INTERVIEW THAT HAPPENED

161
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,287
YESTERDAY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO

162
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:27,321
WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT HAD TO

163
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,956
DO WITH BILL CLINTON THAT'S

164
00:03:28,956 --> 00:03:29,990
WHY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

165
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,291
THIS.

166
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,425
CAN'T WE AS WOMEN TAKE

167
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:32,393
POLITICS OUT OF THIS AND SAY

168
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:33,360
HE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH A

169
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,962
MUCH BETTER, MUCH MORE HEART

170
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:35,763
FELT RESPONSE TO THAT

171
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:36,130
QUESTION?

172
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,498
>> ABBY, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

173
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,033
SO FOR YOU AGAIN TO SIT HERE

174
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,936
AND SAY THAT SOUNDED LIKE

175
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:44,472
BILL CLINTON IS OFFENSIVE.

176
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:45,606
NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE

177
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:46,774
AISLE YOU SIT ON WHAT

178
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,075
CLINTON SAID WAS INCORRECT.

179
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,176
HOWEVER, IN THE SAME TOKEN,

180
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:51,312
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS

181
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:52,046
ACCUSED BY WOMEN OF DOING

182
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,481
THE SAME THING, SO THIS IS

183
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:54,715
NOT A POLITICAL ISSUE.

184
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:55,783
CLINTON IS WRONG.

185
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:57,017
THAT IS INDEFENSIBLE.

186
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,285
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT HE IS

187
00:03:58,285 --> 00:03:58,552
NOT.

188
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:00,054
BUT FOR US TO SIT HERE AND

189
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,056
SAY WE ARE GOING TO PIECE

190
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:03,724
AND PARS MEAL WHAT IS GOING

191
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,860
ON IN THE PAST VERSUS WHAT'S

192
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,861
CURRENTLY GOING ON

193
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:07,995
COMPLETELY AS WOMEN NOT

194
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,563
DOING JUSTICE TO THE ME TOO

195
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:09,930

196
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,764
ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT SHOULD

197
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:11,932
BE ASHAMED.

199
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,400
WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS

200
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,034
ABOUT AT ALL.

201

202
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:16,504
THAT THAT RESPONSE YESTERDAY

203
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:17,971
WAS APPALLING AND

204
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:18,672
EMBARRASSING FOR BILL

205
00:04:18,672 --> 00:00:00,000
CLINTON AND WE WILL SEE HOW
