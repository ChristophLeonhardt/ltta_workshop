hello boy buckle up for this story now we've got a story from the intercept Zi Jelani with an excellent breaking news story they got ahold of a memo that was delivered to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee the d-triple-c those are the establishment Democrats who are theoretically trying to recapture the house but are usually too busy fighting progressive candidates well they asked Greenberg Quinlan Rosner to research to do analysis of the issue of health care how's it gonna play out should we run on it what kind of health care policy should we run out should Democrats run on to get the house back well that's a very important thing and I don't mind them doing polling that makes a lot of sense I wouldn't want him to do polling and they got better and pollster Stan Greenberg who's obviously part of that group to do it and I don't mind that either I think he is normally good at his job and and we've learned a decent amount from his polls in the past but the way they did this polling in so-called research and what their conclusions are is unfortunately as usual maddening so let's go to a description overall Jelani says the messaging handout obtained by the intercept made clear where the party wants its candidates sustained when it comes to health care reform preferably nowhere but certainly not with single payer advocates now I read that in the beginning I thought well are we taking a little bit of Liberty here because that that sounds pretty aggressive are you sure you got enough evidence to back that up an answer is yes I read the memo that definitely backs it up in fact I'll share it with you so let's let's do that so they're gonna ask a question about health care now there's a lot of different ways to ask that question hey are you in favor of single-payer or Medicare for all or no just the public option or just the Affordable Care Act or just a tweak of their portal there's a ton of ways to ask that question in a fair way right but instead they did this the question that Greenberg put before Democrats to make the case against single-payer though is a highly unusual one and the emphasis here is in the original document if you could change one thing about your health care or health insurance would it be the question was not about what kind of system the voter would prefer but a surprising 12% still said they wanted their own assurance to be single-payer so I want you to understand why that's so skewed and what a preposterous way of asking that question so if they ask you if they even ask me what would you like them with your health care I don't know I'd like to cost less and I'd like to have a cover more that's the correct answers but that doesn't tell you what policy position would get it to cost less and cover more this is designed so that people don't say single-payer but 12% of people wrote in single-payer anyway even though it doesn't even make sense in context of answering that question what would you like down to your health care I'd like it to be cheaper right but no they wrote in single-parent but they may turn around and said you see only 12% are in favor of single-payer like that is so fundamentally dishonest why did you do that I mean again look I'm not buy I don't think I'm biased against these people I've quoted a thousand Stan Greenberg polls in the past and I and I thought he'd done a good job in the past but this is a this is done for an obvious political motive and we're not anywhere near the worst of the memo yet but hold I want to show you a poll if you did this right because others have it's Pew Research Center did a poll there's a lot of different ways they've asked this and they've gotten the same answer almost every time over the last year but one way of asking it is do you want the federal government do you think the federal government has responsibility assure health care coverage let's show you the results so and by the way that's you can argue tilted against single-payer because the federal government has a responsibility to ensure health care coverage right 60% of Americans yes yes they do 38% no so huge win for universal health care coverage by the way Medicare for all same exact number 60% so if you actually ask people a single-payer well above 50% in any way you like except this way which is designed to make sure that they you get an answer that is against single-pair oh gee I wonder why the d-triple-c wanted it this way ask and you shall receive so then they get to the part of what do they tell the candidates Democratic candidates running against Republicans what do you talk about when it comes to health care their overwhelming advice was attack the Republicans on their proposal then they got finally to will how about our policy shouldn't we have a policy there Democrats of course on but this is my favorite the title of the part about the Democratic policy is this proactive solutions in brackets only if asked we didn't add that that's in the original memo in other words never talk about your own policy positions unless someone asks you oh oh you put me under the gun now I have to have a proposal I have to try to actually come up with an idea that would help the American people I just like to play politics Oh Trump bad republic is bad well you tried that in 2016 how did it turn out for you these are the worst okay so what are their genius ideas if you are forced to talk about what your ideas are by the way if you never talk about progressive ideas you shouldn't be surprised if the country didn't hear your side of the case and then agreed with the other side in this case we won anyway despite the fact that the Democratic Party laid out on the job progressives are winning on this issue anyway but constant you and a lateral surrender all right so here's their brilliant ideas if you if you ask them about it they say we need the federal government to negotiate with drug companies to get a lower price on medications for people on Medicare just as Veterans Affairs Department already does this will save Americans 24 billion dollars so in other words we should negotiate with drug companies of course that's the bare minimum by the way who prevented us from negotiating with drug companies originally george w bush and then after that barack obama so if you wanted us to negotiate with drug companies there was one way you could have done it when you had the president you had the house here at the senate and you had a supermajority oops okay anyway and that's the bare minimum all right let's go to point number two increase the income threshold so more middle-class people qualify for tax breaks to reduce health care costs you know what that is tax cuts so not universal coverage and not any of the progressive ideas tax cuts point number three and there's the last one we also need to require audits of insurance companies to reduce administrative costs are you kidding me that's your brilliant idea reduce administrative costs that's pathetic man what are you just that is the most benign non-answer in other words how about we reduce administrative costs that doesn't offend anyone right it doesn't offend anyone this party is the worst this establishment is killing us this is why we lose the Republicans over and over again because they won't fight for their ideas because it's not their ideas they don't give a damn but I haven't I mean that the title of you know hey whatever you do don't answer any questions about policy was almost as bad as it gets but wait till you see what they did the single-payer and the rest of the memo so the intercept explains single-payer does however pop up a number of times in the document under the banner likely Republican lines of attack so I read this it's page after page of single-payer is terrible the Republicans will say here I'll give you one example here Heritage Foundation report says single-payer health care will reduce the quality of care limit access to care and slow the rate of medical progress yes that's what they said they're a right-wing think-tank partly funded by pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies but what do we say no there was no positive talking points of a single-payer or any of the other so-called democratic proposals it was page after page of Republicans say single-payer sucks remember everybody's single-payer sucks Republicans say sucks and oh one other thing Bernie Sanders sucks more than half the headlines was Bern Sanders single-payer ideas terrible so here's here's some more headlines for the memo and they're quoting articles that smear either single-payer or Bernie Sanders how is this a democratic talking point okay millions would lose their health insurance under a single-payer health care plan again this is not the Republicans and Democrats talking points they're saying this is what the Republicans are gonna say so whatever you do don't be in favor of single-payer all right here's more Washington Post fact checker Sanders proposed bill that would have eliminated Medicare Medicaid Affordable Care Act state exchanges and divorce the Affordable Care Act tax credits or diverted okay now by the way both of those last two headlines are wildly misleading why would single-payer get rid of Medicare and Medicaid and Affordable Care Act because it would be a system that replaced them with universal health care coverage so for example if you did Medicare for all they would turn around go oh there are guest Medicaid no we didn't Medicare for everyone so you don't need Medicaid because now everyone's on Medicare not just the whole people who love it people under above the age of 65 Medicare poles at seventy seven percent they love it they don't have that pull in here okay I can go on forever another one millions would lose their health insurance under single-payer health care plan based on what it is by definition universal coverage everyone gets it these smear jobs by the right wing attack machine the Democratic memo puts two and cents every Democratic candidate hey remember everybody's single-payer is terrible don't do it they are the worst okay back to this Greenberg memo they say the American people overwhelmingly want Congress to improve the Affordable Care Act not repeal it or replace it with something radically different we need to offer reasonable solutions to improve the law instead of a massive overhaul this memo is not directed to fight the Republicans it's directed to fight Bernie Sanders in single-payer so dick Radek overall we already had that under Trump so they're saying now don't do that but also don't do the other one that I just warned you about page after page after page of what the Republican will say about you don't you dare do it no get back in line and do the Affordable Care Act which by the way was a proposal initially from the Heritage Foundation so look at that the Democrats agree what the Heritage Foundation again look I don't know this is fair or not but near the end of the article the intercept does point out in a comment to the intercept greenberg noted that Alan Quinlan a partner at his firm led to work on the poll okay on the firm's website Quinlan lists Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan as one of his former clients now if they had done a fair poll and a fair memo and given that to Democratic candidate so they could defeat Republicans any question that he you work for Blue Cross Blue Shield maybe it affected it maybe it didn't but you do this poll and this memo and then you send it to every Democratic candidate in the country and running for the House seats no they get the point out that you used to work for one of these companies that you are now saying whatever you do protect those companies and never ever do single-payer this is the miserable state of the Democratic Party support progressive candidates support uncorrupted progressive candidates but look I do a show every night call rebel headquarters right after the Young Turks i neariy candidates that are associated and not associated with different progressive groups we try to bring them all on at all the different levels so support those guys do your own research in your district find a progressive candidate one easy ways the Justice Democrats because you are not allowed to be a justice Democrat if you take corporate PAC money and serve these corporate interests and they have a progressive platform that's deeply progressive there's a lot of other wonderful groups the p triple c democracy for america our revolution go find those groups but if you think that the democratic party is coming to save you or to serve you as a progressive you have no idea what's happening inside of a democratic party run for the hills and support real progressives so we can actually be trip it's alright we'll have links for those groups down below in the description box go check them out for
