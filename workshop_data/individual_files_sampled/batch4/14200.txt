for the last 11 days we've had a number of stunning developments many of which no one saw coming the important thing here is two things I think first of all Kim Kim jong-un the North Korean leader for the first time since the end of the fighting in the Korean War actually went to South Korea he did that on Friday by stepping over the military demarcation line at Panmunjom but what's really interesting is that even before talks begin with President Trump the North Koreans have made some big concessions yeah the North Koreans will concede stuff during the talks but to actually do that before meeting Trump I think is is really important and one of the things that Kim said on Friday to mujhey in the South Korean president was important he said that he was going to give up all of his nuclear weapons for two things one of them is a u.s. pledge not to attack North Korea the second is for the u.s. to sign a peace treaty to formally turn the Armistice into the end of the Korean War now if we had gotten to this place you know I'd say after five years of negotiating with the Koreas we would have declared a great victory but we've gotten here even before we've showed up now is North Korea serious probably not but nonetheless north korea has created a marker for itself and Trumpkin hauled kim to that marker yeah you know it's interesting in the past North Korea has demanded massive amounts of aid a huge amount of fuel energy relief in other ways the two demands you outline please don't invade us and please actually make the peace treaty formal our defense of their saying please don't hurt me not please give me things as please no more I would imagine that part of that has to do with the psychology of Trump as a plan his style and aesthetic and oh my god is he really serious about having a bigger button on it like they had that Twitter war a few months back and and so many pundits in the West said Oh Trump is coming across as reckless and dangerous but maybe that's what it took to actually scare the Hermit Kings mindset maybe he just laughed at everyone and thought oh my god Trump is actually crazy enough to do it yeah well there's actually a number of Asia analysts including Andre long cough who is a leading observer of the Korean Peninsula who does credit Trump because what he says is that towards the end of 2017 we saw that China and the two Koreas changed their policies dramatically and the only reason for that would be that they were worried about going to war and of course that is because of the threats that President Trump and his surrogates have made um there's another reason and that is the enforcement of sanctions by the Trump administration you know the US has gone to the UN a number of times to get tougher rules also their unilateral American sanctions those are cutting off the flow of money to North Korea so you put that together the threats of war and sanctions and that's I think why Kim is much more amenable that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
