now it turns out that one news outlet has been forced to remove its political ads from Facebook was the US government's own Radio Free Europe aka Radio Liberty here's an extract from their mission statement which of course you can find on their website which ends in dot gov a mission is to promote democratic values and institutions by reporting the news in countries where Free Press is banned by the government are not fully established our journalists provide what many people cannot get locally uncensored news responsible discussion and open debate perhaps they consider the United States to be one of those countries that doesn't have a Free Press after all the ads were specifically targeted at Americans now Facebook says the ads were not political which is rather interesting as they were specifically related to recent controversies regarding Trump and NATO 61% of the surveyed population in 12 countries view NATO favorably it's actually illegal for federally-funded news outlets under the umbrella of the broadcast Board of Governors to direct their content at an American audience the only exception is by special requests and there was none in the case of Radio Liberty after New York Times journalists raised a red flag the board of governors deleted the ads none of the BBG networks should be distributing or promoting our content domestically in order to develop or grow domestic audiences why would Facebook allow ads about NATO to begin with this is just after Facebook has imposed strict rules regarding commercials with political content in the United States our team materials frequently banned and that's even when it's not directed an American audience o election-related and issue ads on Facebook and Instagram in the US must be clearly labeled including a paid for by discovery at it turns out that the rules about what constitutes a political ad are pretty vague as far as Facebook is concerned any arty news related to the USA is a political advert meanwhile a commercial specifically talking about how everyone loves NATO is not now russian scholar sean galore II recently tried to promote an interview about his recently published compendium of coverage of Donald Trump from Russian magazines and newspapers Facebook shut him down Facebook won't approve my eight for this podcast apparently what the Russian press thinks of Trump is dangerous information there's this double standard if if you want to break the rules to help defend freedom okay which is which is really not possible as a logical they've constantly lived in this state of the false reality where it's okay to propagandize and to blanket the rest of the world with a CIA funded message but it's not okay for Russia to finance or to partially even finance a great television network that's competitive with the BBC for news and information why is that not okay all this talk about fake news and propaganda has put the US political establishment and tech giants like Facebook in a pretty difficult spot basically they've been reduced to saying we can't promote it if we don't agree with it Kalib Maupin RT New York you
