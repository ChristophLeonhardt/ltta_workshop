1
00:00:00,935 --> 00:00:04,640
I’m Stefano Sollima, and I’m
the director of “Sicario: Day

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,310
of the Soldado."

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,340
This scene is the
main moment in which

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,520
we see something
changing in Alejandro,

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,750
played by Benicio Del Toro.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,210
It’s a sort of reminder
of his past, of his loss,

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:33,740
of his family that was
killed, of his own daughter.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,700
And then, of course,
having Isabel next to him

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,550
during this reminiscence
plays a key role

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,070
in their relationship.

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,390
And this is sort of
a switch of emotion.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,140
Because until now,
Isabel has only

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,380
being a sort of pawn
in Alejandro’s hand

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,879
to win this dirty war,
to get his vengeance.

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,620
I feel interested in this scene,

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,920
because it’s the
first scene ever

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,410
where we introduce a skill
of Alejandro that has nothing

18
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,020
to do with his vengeance.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,100
I felt it was important
to bring down the volume

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,780
after one of the
biggest action

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,150
set pieces in the movie.

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,630
I felt that there was a big
need of a quieter moment.

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,880
Because by listening to the
silence in this sequence,

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,630
and feeling the humanity
and the normal life

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,360
of this deaf, mute
man, we are able to put

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,220
the loudness and the
violence of the action a bit

27
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,420
in perspective.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
In the original
script, it was spoken.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,730
And it was Benicio’s
idea to change it

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,350
into sign language exchange.

31
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,510
I think it’s really smart.

32
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,700
Because in this way, we
create an immediate bond

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:00:00,000
between the two guys.
