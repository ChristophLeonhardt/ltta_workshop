00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,910
Bats are
amazing fliers,

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,500
and their flexible
wings are a source

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,460
of endless fascination to
scientists who study flight.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,340
For instance, what about
those long, thin muscles

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,580
in bat wings that aren’t
attached to any bones?

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,730
It seemed that those muscles
might help shape the wings

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,980
in flight, and now
researchers have

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,120
evidence that that’s true.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,180
But it wasn’t easy to get.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,870
Brown University scientists
used ultrathin electrodes

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,720
to record muscle
activity while the bats

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,760
were flying in a wind tunnel.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,970
They also shot high-speed
video at the same time.

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,820
Sure enough, the
muscles contract

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,300
on the downstroke, and that
could make the wings

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,389
stretch less, which would
help the bat fly.

17
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,180
That could be good to
know if you’re making

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,800
soft-winged flying robots.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,790
But really, the
reason to study bats

20
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,330
is that nothing else on
Earth flies the way they do,

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:00,000
and they fly very, very well.
