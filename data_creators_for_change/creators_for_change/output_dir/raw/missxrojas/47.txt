00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
hi everyone say one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my big fears for</font>

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,990
2017<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just life in general is that</font>

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,819
will lose the amazing momentum that

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,799
stuff this year where we still women's

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,080
marches and people going to airport to

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,759
stand up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Muslims and stand up for</font>

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">refugees and just have this sense that</font>

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,379
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we weren't</font>

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,539
doing enough before you kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> coast it</font>

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,640
a little bit we weren't getting in touch

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,750
with the people you were supposed to

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,789
represent us we weren't showing up and

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,529
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point of what felt like</font>

14
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,560
great global crisis or at these several

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,410
points of great global crises 2016 was a

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,270
tough one<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we find in ourselves the</font>

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,489
urgency that we needed to ask Taylor

18
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,230
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather time when my absolute</font>

19
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,790
favorite youtubers released a video

20
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,649
about a month ago called business

21
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,450
challenge Taylor's video ties into my

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,920
sense that more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than ever we have</font>

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility to share ways we can get</font>

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,480
more involved not less<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved so the</font>

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,860
first challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to familiarize</font>

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,239
yourself with the ways in which you can

27
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,590
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in contact with the people you</font>

28
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,300
represent you as I made a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> others</font>

29
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">could call your representatives which I</font>

30
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,109
did an example phone call I use the

31
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,480
website prior calls or but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I survived by</font>

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,190
kayla i also added<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contact</font>

33
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,660
information of the office of my

34
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,760
representative and my senators into my

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,380
phone and that is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean you can</font>

36
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,909
the preferred method of contact for an

37
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,130
MP to write to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> i added their</font>

38
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,810
contact information into my address book

39
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,939
in gmail that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all i have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is write</font>

40
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,350
the first couple messages and Randy's

41
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,780
name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper pops in gmail also fell</font>

42
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,090
easy does it the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge was to</font>

43
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,799
set up at require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a donation this</font>

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading health charities with their</font>

45
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,590
planning and budgeting for the year

46
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,299
ahead certain other recurring donation

47
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,500
isn't something that's always impossible

48
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,329
for me so I completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand if</font>

49
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,770
this one doesn't seem like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> option to</font>

50
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,210
you you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not realize we have the</font>

51
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">money the whole idea might make you</font>

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,659
extremely anxious we might not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

53
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,280
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a credit card signed account</font>

54
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,840
so if any of that applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you or</font>

55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,850
other reasons as well consider setting

56
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,460
up a monthly recurring volunteer day

57
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,570
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so different to purchase</font>

58
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,340
this you can have a fundraising angle

59
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,290
you can go to a local have a hard day

60
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,880
you can go to the website the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charities</font>

61
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'd want to donate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and look for</font>

62
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,450
ways you can volunteer again both often

63
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,590
they have lists of that it's about

64
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">carving out that time it doesn't have to</font>

65
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,860
be the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time every single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> month</font>

66
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,360
there some schedule changes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

67
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">different shifts and so on but setting</font>

68
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,840
out specific amount of time every single

69
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">month that you commit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to doing something</font>

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,740
I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful because</font>

71
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,720
often the month rushes by and all the

72
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,669
sudden it

73
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,110
and then I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait a minute where</font>

74
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,819
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that go in my life I found as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">my stuff and see what I can get rid of</font>

79

80
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,970
three was by the protest this was

81
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,530
something that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a saving grace</font>

82
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,459
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Indiana because I struggle to get out</font>

83
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door every morning knowing that</font>

84
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,880
going to still see a bunch of cars with

85
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,010
chump stickers on them or that I've been

86
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,540
walking to a bar and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

87
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,640
a guy in the mid-american great game cap

88
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,650
or a check the news and find that

89
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,300
there's a guy who's been hanging and

90
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,640
Nazi flag outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> path I read</font>

91
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that article today it is not far from</font>

92
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,049
where of it and I am just I can't I

93
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,450
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> process that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just I get so</font>

94
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,340
angry so it can feel really isolating

95
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,450
and they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this isn't the case</font>

96
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">for everywhere but it's been amazing for</font>

97
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,090
me in Indiana to show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protest and</font>

98
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,220
have thousands people who are standing

99
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,500
alongside me my friends and I went down

100
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,450
to the airport protests not expecting

101
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,830
there to be that much of a showing at

102
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,690
all and feeling like a voice was

103
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,640
particularly important because of that I

104
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,410
nearly breakdown fist pounding for

105
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,519
stopping when I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how many</font>

106
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have shown up so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do find a</font>

107
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,459
protest about something you care about

108
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,230
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't so much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for science is</font>

109
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,180
coming up for example turnout might not

110
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,060
be at the scale of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC or Chicago or New</font>

111
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,100
York relay but with you there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

112
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,079
adding a whole person to protest and

113
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,340
even more if you bring along some

114
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,140
friends to number four is run for office

115
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,940
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the be-all and end-all if</font>

116
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,320
you don't want to run for something

117
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,700
that's literally website good run for

118
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,230
something to organ this is a great way

119
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's find out about people who are</font>

120
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">running near you and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

121
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,870
process is actually like what the

122
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,880
requirements are really it's a civic

123
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,470
education and local government so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

124
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,609
signed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run for something</font>

125
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,230
newsletters but i also have a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

126
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,420
for a bonus exercise which is running a

127
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,100
state campaign for yourself that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

128
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,690
make you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what roles that</font>

129
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,910
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> is responsible for who you be</font>

130
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,739
speaking to what issues are important to

131
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,150
you what issues aren't being dealt with

132
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also existing possible solutions and</font>

133
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,040
groups that you could work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with to get</font>

134
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,780
to those places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you think that</font>

135
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,400
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> office should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

136
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,070
grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nap and then it's terrible</font>

137
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the frame but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just ruined</font>

138
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,149
every word aiming for<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents number</font>

139
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:20,920
five is

140
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,570
listen I tried to be a better listener

141
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">tightly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a question asker and I've</font>

142
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,620
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> sought really care for me about the</font>

143

kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to</font>

enjoying the podcast the conversation

146
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,280
not to be confused with the series

insurance the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> age you were many</font>
