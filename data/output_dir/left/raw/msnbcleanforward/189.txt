FIRING OFF THREATS TO LEADERS OVER IMMIGRATION.

32
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,053
OVER IMMIGRATION. ALL OF THAT HAPPENED ON THE DAY

33
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,555
ALL OF THAT HAPPENED ON THE DAY THE PRESIDENT HAD NO SCHEDULED

34
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:54,889
THE PRESIDENT HAD NO SCHEDULED EVENTS.

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FOX LAST NIGHT HE BLASTED THE FED CHAIR.

43
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:12,873
NIGHT HE BLASTED THE FED CHAIR. >> MY BIGGEST THREAT IS THE FED

44
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:14,742
>> MY BIGGEST THREAT IS THE FED BECAUSE THE FED IS RAISING RATES

45
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:17,277
BECAUSE THE FED IS RAISING RATES TOO FAST.

46
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,278
TOO FAST. AND IT’S INDEPENDENT, SO I DON’T

47
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,914
AND IT’S INDEPENDENT, SO I DON’T SPEAK TO HIM, BUT I’M NOT HAPPY

48
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:23,751
SPEAK TO HIM, BUT I’M NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT HE’S DOING.

49
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:24,985
WITH WHAT HE’S DOING. IT’S GOING TOO FAST.

50
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,620
IT’S GOING TOO FAST. LAST INFLATION NUMBERS ARE VERY

51
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:26,954
LAST INFLATION NUMBERS ARE VERY LOW.

52
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:30,157

>> HELP ME OUT HERE, SENATOR, HE TWEETED LAST NIGHT STOCK MARKET

00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,594
TWEETED LAST NIGHT STOCK MARKET IS UP 548 POINTS, AND JOB

55
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:35,462
IS UP 548 POINTS, AND JOB NUMBERS ARE GREAT.

56
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:37,164
NUMBERS ARE GREAT. HE SAID NO ONE IN THE MAINSTREAM

57
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,399
HE SAID NO ONE IN THE MAINSTREAM NEWS COVERED THE MARKET.

58
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,567
NEWS COVERED THE MARKET. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A LIE, WE’RE

59
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,601
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A LIE, WE’RE DOING IT RIGHT HERE.

60
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:41,569
DOING IT RIGHT HERE. WHICH IS IT?

61
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:44,605
WHICH IS IT? IF THE MARKET DROPPED LAST WEEK

62
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:47,208
IF THE MARKET DROPPED LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF CRAZY JAY POWELL

63
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,176
BECAUSE OF CRAZY JAY POWELL WHO’S RAISING RATES, HOW DID THE

64
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:51,612
WHO’S RAISING RATES, HOW DID THE MARK GO BACK UP YESTERDAY?

65
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:54,215
MARK GO BACK UP YESTERDAY? PRETTY SURE HE DIDN’T LOWER THE

66
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:54,549
PRETTY SURE HE DIDN’T LOWER THE RATES.

67
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,816
RATES. >> TWO REASONS WHY THE FED IS

68
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:56,450
>> TWO REASONS WHY THE FED IS RAISING RATES.

69
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,019
RAISING RATES. ONE IS CONCERN ABOUT INFLATION.

70
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,123
ONE IS CONCERN ABOUT INFLATION. THE OTHER IS CONCERN ABOUT

71
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:02,523
THE OTHER IS CONCERN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

72
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,924
DONALD TRUMP. THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO

73
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:07,095
THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO HAVE ITS FIRST TRILLION DOLLAR

74
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:07,428
HAVE ITS FIRST TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT.

75
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:08,162
DEFICIT. THAT MEANS THAT IF THE COUNTRY

76
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:08,930
THAT MEANS THAT IF THE COUNTRY GOES INTO A RECESSION WE HAVE

77
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,431
GOES INTO A RECESSION WE HAVE TWO WEAPONS TO DEAL WITH THE

78
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,633
TWO WEAPONS TO DEAL WITH THE RECESSION, FISCAL AND MONETARY

79
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,033
RECESSION, FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY.

80
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:14,469
POLICY. WE ARE WITHOUT FISCAL POLICY.

81
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,337
WE ARE WITHOUT FISCAL POLICY. IF WE WENT INTO A RECESSION

82
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:18,206
IF WE WENT INTO A RECESSION TOMORROW, WE CANNOT GO DEEPLY

83
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:19,640
TOMORROW, WE CANNOT GO DEEPLY INTO DEFICIT SPENDING TO GET OUT

84
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,274
INTO DEFICIT SPENDING TO GET OUT OF IT.

85
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:22,043
OF IT. WE ALREADY SPENT THE MONEY.

86
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:25,146
WE ALREADY SPENT THE MONEY. THE OTHER IS CUT INTEREST RATES.

87
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:26,714
THE OTHER IS CUT INTEREST RATES. THE FED DOESN’T JUST FIGHT

88
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:27,448
THE FED DOESN’T JUST FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION.

89
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:29,417
AGAINST INFLATION. THEY WANT TO GET INTEREST RATES

90
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,619
THEY WANT TO GET INTEREST RATES HIGHER SO IF THE COUNTRY GOES

91
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,154
HIGHER SO IF THE COUNTRY GOES INEVITABLY INTO A RECESSION NEXT

92
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,622
INEVITABLY INTO A RECESSION NEXT FEW YEARS, THEY’VE GOT SOME

93
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:35,657
FEW YEARS, THEY’VE GOT SOME WEAPON TO COUNTER IT.

94
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:36,824
WEAPON TO COUNTER IT. THAT’S CUTTING RATES.

95
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,626
THAT’S CUTTING RATES. TO CUT RATES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

96
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:40,128
TO CUT RATES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RATE BASE HIGHER, THAT’S PART OF

97
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:40,762
RATE BASE HIGHER, THAT’S PART OF WHAT THEY’RE DOING.

98
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,264
WHAT THEY’RE DOING. THE REASON THEY’RE DOING IT IS

99
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:43,965
THE REASON THEY’RE DOING IT IS DONALD TRUMP AND THE TAX CUT.

100
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:44,933
DONALD TRUMP AND THE TAX CUT. >> I THINK THE SENATOR IS

101
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:46,167
>> I THINK THE SENATOR IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

102
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:48,202
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THERE’S ANOTHER POINT WE SHOULD

103
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:48,970
THERE’S ANOTHER POINT WE SHOULD UNDERSCORE HERE.

104
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:51,573
UNDERSCORE HERE. THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL

105
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:54,476
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN SACROSANCT

106
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,244
RESERVE HAS BEEN SACROSANCT POLITICAL NORM UNDER BOTH

107
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,279
POLITICAL NORM UNDER BOTH PARTIES FOR AS LONG AS I CAN

108
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,447
PARTIES FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER, WHETHER THE CHAIRMAN

109
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:05,687
REMEMBER, WHETHER THE CHAIRMAN WAS PAUL VOCCER OR ALLEN

110
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,422
WAS PAUL VOCCER OR ALLEN GREENSPAN AND SO ON.

111
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:08,756
GREENSPAN AND SO ON. THE ATTACK ON THE

112
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:10,091
THE ATTACK ON THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE FED IS AN

113
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:11,693
DECISION-MAKING OF THE FED IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF NORMS

114
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:12,527
EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF NORMS VIOLATION AND INSTITUTIONAL

115
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,062
VIOLATION AND INSTITUTIONAL CORROSION BY THE TRUMP

116
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:14,496
CORROSION BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

117
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,265
ADMINISTRATION. I GUESS WE’RE GETTING USED TO IT

118
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,699
I GUESS WE’RE GETTING USED TO IT NOW.

119
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,568
NOW. BUT THIS IS REALLY THE ROAD TO

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:19,901
BUT THIS IS REALLY THE ROAD TO ARGENTINA.

121
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,936
ARGENTINA. THIS IS THE ROAD TO COUNTRIES

122
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:23,805
THIS IS THE ROAD TO COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RUINED THEMSELVES

123
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
THAT HAVE RUINED THEMSELVES THROUGH INFLATIONARY SPIRALS

124
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,577
THROUGH INFLATIONARY SPIRALS WHEN YOU TRY TO OWN THE

125
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:29,277
WHEN YOU TRY TO OWN THE DECISIONMAKING OF THE

126
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,278
DECISIONMAKING OF THE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES

127
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,079
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES SUPPLYING MONEY TO THE ECONOMY.
