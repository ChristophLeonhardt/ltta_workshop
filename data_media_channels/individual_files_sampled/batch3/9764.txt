I THINK WE CAN ONLY SAY, ARE PEOPLE LITERALLY DEALING WITH THEM RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE MEETING. Bret: PRESIDENT TRUMP PRETTY PASSIVE ON THAT MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN, SEEMING TO HOPE TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK. AT THE NORTH KOREAN SENT OUT A SHOT, IF YOU WILL COME ABOUT MILITARY EXERCISES WITH SOUTH KOREA. PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH THE VICE PREMIER OF CHINA TODAY, TWEETING OUT A PICTURE AND SAYING THAT MEETING WENT WELL AS CHINA PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE OBVIOUSLY IN ALL OF THIS. PLUS, THE CHINA TRADE NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE STILL CONTINUING. WITH THAT, LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL. JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR AXIOS. THE ASSOCIATE EDITOR AT REAL CLEAR POLITICS, AND ELI LAKE, COLUMNIST FOR A BLOOMBERG VIEW. JONATHAN, WHAT ARE THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE WHITE HOUSE THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE SUMMIT ON JUNE 12TH? I HEARD KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING, IT COULD BE DELAYED. I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN UNEASINESS, ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO WELL FOR A WHILE. KIM JONG UN WAS RELEASING THE HOSTAGES AND THEATRICALLY DESTROYING THE NUCLEAR FACILITY. BUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT EVEN THE NOTION OF TRUMP GOING OVER THERE AND MEETING WITH HIM. HE HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS CAROUSEL BEFORE, AND HE DOES NOT TRUST THE NORTH KOREANS. HE'S NEVER HAD FAITH IN THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD. I THINK HE HAD A VERY TOUGH HARD-LINE THERE WITH JOHN FULTON WHO IS TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT EVERY DAY, AND THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO THIS, ONCE THE MEETING FACE-TO-FACE AND THEY ARE CARRYING ON AS IF NOTHING HAS CHANGED. Bret: SPEAKING OF BOLTON, HE WAS MENTIONED BY THE NORTH KOREANS AND THE STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY. HE ALSO TOLD CHRIS WALLACE SOMETHING THAT RAISED EYEBROWS AND GOT SOME RESPONSE. WE HAVE VERY MUCH IN MIND THE LIBYA MODEL FROM 2003-2004. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES IN THE LIBYAN PROGRAM WAS MUCH SMALLER, BUT THAT WAS BASICALLY THE AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO. WE WILL WANT TO TEST NORTH KOREA IN THIS FIRST MEETING FOR EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE MADE THAT STRATEGIC DECISION. President Trump: THE LIBYAN MODEL ISN'T THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE AT ALL. IN LIBYA, WE DECIMATED THAT COUNTRY. THE LIBYAN MODEL THAT BOLTON IS TALKING ABOUT IS HOW THEY GOT RID OF THEIR WEAPONS AND THEIR ABILITY TO START ON THAT PROGRAM ABILITY TO START ON THAT PROGRA PROGRAM. NOT THE ACTUAL END OF MUAMMAR QADDAFI, AND HOW IT CAME TO AN END. WHILE THAT IS HOW THEY SEE IT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED WITH AND THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REFERRED TO TODAY. AND FROM SOMEONE AT THE HESS LEVELS OF THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. HE ACTUALLY OFFERED THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER SOME PROTECTIONS TODAY, IF HE AGREES TO DENUCLEARIZE. I DO THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION, AND PARTICULARLY THE PRESIDENT IS HANDLING THIS IN A VERY SHREWD WAY, WHATEVER IT IS, WHETHER IT IS SABER RATTLING OR WHATEVER, THAT KIM JONG UN LOON IS DOING BY CANCELING TALKS WITH THE SOUTH KOREANS AND THREATENING AL THE TENSION, THE PRESIDENT SAID I'M TRYING TO GIVE EVERYONE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO AVERT WAR AND STILL TRYING TO CREATE DISCUSSION. I BET EVERYTHING JONATHAN IS SAYING IS TRUE ABOUT BOLTON'S INFLUENCE AND TEMPERING THE PRESIDENT'S EXPECTATIONS, BUT I THINK THEY ARE HANDLING THE WAY IT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED. KIM JONG UN TOOK THOSE HOSTAGES, TO RELEASE THEM. SO FAR HE HAS BEEN WAY TOO ACQUIESCENT IN HIS LANGUAGE, FOR A LONG-STANDING GOAL OF THAT REGIME TO BE BELIEVABLE. AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS, WE WILL SEE. BUT THEY JUST NEED TO TRY TO GET THE PROSPECT OF THIS ALIVE WELL BEING CAUTIOUS. Bret: ELI? I WOULD SAY THAT I'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE NORTH KOREA OUTREACH FOR SOME TIME, BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHINA PART OF THIS WHERE IT SEEMS THAT TRUMP IS REVERSING HIMSELF ON THE ZTE SANCTIONS, AND THIS IS AFTER A LONG AND RIGOROUS LEGAL PROCESS. I JUST THINK THAT ALL OF THIS IS SENDING THE WRONG SIGNAL AT THIS POINT. THE UNITED STATES THAT CERTAIN NORMS, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES OF NUCLEAR PLEURA FEDERATION PROLIFERATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS TALK ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION, WHAT THEY MEAN IS BREAKING THE U.S.-SOUTH KOREA ALLIANCE. SO IF WE DON'T HAVE CLARIFICATION AT THIS POINT ON IT, I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIMISM FOR THESE TALKS. AS MUCH AS I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS AT LEAST TRYING, AND HE COULD USE SOMEONE LIKE JOHN BOLTON, HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, AS A BIT OF LEVERAGE AND PERHAPS INTIMIDATE A TYRANT LIKE KIM JONG UN. BUT THIS COULD BE VERY TROUBLING. OF COURSE THE LIBYA MODEL IS WHAT WE ARE SEEKING AND WE WANT TO GET RID OF THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. WHAT ELSE ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ABOUT? Bret: YES. LET'S DO SUMMIT CASINO. AS IT'S MOVING FORWARD, AND WHERE ARE YOUR CHIPS ON THE ROAD, JONATHAN? PROBABLY 60. I THINK 75. I THINK THE DATE COULD CHANGE BUT I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE KIM JONG UN WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD GET THIS FAR, BUT I'M WORRIED. IF THEY CAN'T EVEN READ THAT THE
