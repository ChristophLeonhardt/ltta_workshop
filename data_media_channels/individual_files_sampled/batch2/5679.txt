Michael Cohen's lawyers have filed a new motion trying to keep stormy Daniels very visible attorney Michael avenatti away from the federal proceedings in New York this is Reuters is reporting the Malheur subpoenaed another aide to Roger stone who reportedly worked for stone as an accountant and it builds on news from two days ago that Miller was issuing a subpoena to speak with a social media expert who also worked for stone for his part stone says that Miller has not contacted him yet he doesn't know where he fits into all this well at this point I don't know if I'm a person of interest or just an interesting person is not pleasant to have a special prosecutor will unbridled power in your emails in your text messages in your phone calls and he's very clearly in mine I'm talking about the Wall Street Journal Shelby Holliday and former federal prosecutor Paul Butler and David corn by phone Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones I Shelby a Roger stone refers to himself as an interesting person that is fair and something critics I think anyone's denying that and sports agree on but but it is clearly notable that his associates are being hit while he is not yes and he hasn't heard a word from Moeller our Moeller's team i talked to his lawyer today and you know it's a little concerning for people around Roger stone when they hear that that suggests he might be a subject or even a target but what's so interesting about these late recent subpoenas is yes they have to do with social media and for a long time we've talked about Roger stones tweets and some of his comments about Julian Assange but they also have to do with his pack and as you mentioned one of these guys was his and it was his accountant so it suggests that Muller may be looking into financial information I was just speaking to Sam Nunn Berg who is also close to Roger stone and had to turn over documents related to Roger stone and Sam says it may not just be about the Assange comments it may not just have to do with WikiLeaks this could be a lot deeper than people realized and that's certainly something that Jonah would be concerned about right and that Paul Butler goes to the Cohen investigation nobody knew even a month ago that there was such a money trail connecting Michael Cohen to major companies in United States and major firms linked to Putin oligarchs listen to Rogers don't talk about the social media part of what he describes his young people who work for him it's very clear that not only has mr. Muller subpoenaed a part-time consultant who worked for me for three months he's also dropped subpoenas on a number of other young people who work for me what does it take to get that and what does it tell you that Muller is doing that it tells us that they're coming for Roger stone he's been a shady character for day one in this investigation so remember we have these hack emails that our intelligence community tells us Russia was responsible for they wind up in wiki leaks and Roger stone knows all about what's coming out before the hack emails are released he's going all over the media and umbria are predicting that some dirt is coming down and Hillary how does he know this he's been inconsistent about his relationship with WikiLeaks at times he says he knows Julie Asajj other times he says he doesn't know WikiLeaks at one point disavows him and then the day after the election re there's that bizarre tweet from WikiLeaks to Roger stone now we're free to talk really fishy Muller's gotta investigate that this gentleman who like many people who pop up in this story we hadn't heard a thing about before john kkuk anis a 30 years old david korn and he says he was briefly questioned by the FBI Russian interference came up you'd expect that but also WikiLeaks website which was just mentioned Assange and hackers behind gusoff or 2.0 which has been alleged to be a front for Russian intelligence which gets you pretty close into the beating heart of collusion David well it does because Roger stone has told many inconsistent stories about his connection with Assad but he did have a relationship with gusenberg 2.0 which is probably a set of hackers who pretended they were a single Romanian hacker and whether he broke the law or not whether he's eluded or not one thing is clear in the summer of 2016 when people were saying the Russians were attacking the United States the election by stealing emails and putting them out he was out there saying Goosen 42.0 is not a Russian operation it is indeed a Romanian actor he was doing this through Breitbart so in essence what he was doing was protecting a Russian propaganda intelligence operation now that may not be something that you can be prosecuted for but indeed you know he's already done something quite wrong in terms of siding with a foreign power that was engaged in information warfare against the United States now the details are to what degree he worked with them if at all and if that puts him under a criminal tent he's been advocating for a pardon for Assange for quite some time he's out there saying the president should pardon Assange even though Assange you know according to a tell intelligence agencies was a hostile actor to the United States and releasing some of these hacked emails but I also think there's another thing that could be concerning for Roger stone and that is whether or not he told the truth when he was under oath in front of the House Intelligence Committee you've had Randy critical on your show before and Randy has said publicly that he didn't talk to us on she didn't have any communication with him in 25th right he said that there are a lot of Rogers controversial tweets more he said more bluntly what credit go said that its knowledge was lying in trying to cite him as his intermediary go ahead Paul and we also know that Roger stone is Donald Trump's do they talk the president reportedly confides in helm so we know that mother's tactic is to try to get any kind of incriminating information against subjects or try to force them to plead guilty right and then cooperate so you put your finger on something so important Paul and take a listen to this moment in the Netflix documentary about stone because what Muller seems to understand that maybe did confuse some other more casual observers is that Donald Trump's closest people don't necessarily come to the White House with them they stay at a kind of a funny distance stone Michael Cohen Keith's chiller who was in briefly but is out but still involved take a listen to this political horseflesh turn of phrase from the documentary Roger always wanted me to run for president I was like a jockey looking for a horse you can't win the race if you don't have a horse and he is a prime piece of political horse flesh in my view Paul can you speak to that out that horse meat I don't know if I want to speak about a horse meat Ari but again what we do know is that Roger Muller is trying to get people to cooperate so he's going to you know use all of his tools anything at his disposal to try to turn Roger stone the so the first step is to find something that charged him with a crime it's very instrumental but again this is at the end of the day all about collusion which we have Roger stone implicated again and it's about about President Trump and his role of this hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to
