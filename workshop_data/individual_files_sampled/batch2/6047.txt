so now that bread Kavanagh has been picked by Donald Trump for the Supreme Court pick what will the politics of this situation be and how will it fall out so well the Republicans blocked Obama's picked for over a year and they said that's because in elections coming up we have to have the will of the people well an election is now way closer than a year right it's about 120 days out or so so under the Republican so-called rule we should definitely pause and and not confirm this nominee now of course Mitch McConnell laughed and laughed at that and they say he said oh no no that was when the Democrats were in charge now we will rush to confirm immediately well doesn't that seem hypocritical his answer was largely yeah whatever okay so the Republicans are going full steam ahead no of course no one's surprised by that so the question is what will the Democrats do now they have huffed and puffed but you have seen them huff and puff before so they're like oh well I'll tell you this we are gonna fight this and we remember what happen with Merrick garland and then okay now that we have the pick even hours before the pick came the first signs of surrender now look we get to judge this in real time and if they fight like hell and they make sure he doesn't get confirmed then I'll give me all the credit in the world they don't know how to blow the house down no yeah they blow son but not the house down okay so let's go to the mainstream press which loves to buttress Republican talking points and tell the Democrats to give up that's their number one go-to move and the Democrats always go oh my god the New York Times or The Washington Post wrote it all we got to give up right away right now when the Republicans look at the New York Times Washington Post or anything else they're like yeah whatever fake news I don't care right and it's not fake news but the Republicans at least fight for their principles here we're calling it like it is right Democrats will get scared off with this so the New York Times immediately characterized it as quote for Democrats the nomination sets up a political battle they are almost certain to lose now look if you're just saying in the context if they're gonna get outvoted they were hoping that 50 senators and the Democrats caucus with only 49 okay that could be a fair point depends on if they hold all the Republicans right but no they go on to explain that well they have this no-win situation in these red states where the Democrats you know they're they'll get punished if they don't do exactly what Trump tells them and do you have any polling on that no but Trump won the state big okay that's fair that's certainly an important data point but do you know why do you one of the reasons why in my opinion was because he was strong at least he had the appearance of strength and so going around going okay I'll do whatever job tells me doesn't really help you with those voters right and also if you if you fight and you fight hard on issues that you know Americans overwhelmingly support like reproductive rights then you could make a case that confirming someone like Cavanaugh does not actually serve the best interests of the American people but you don't have to fight you'd have to fight it you have to think of a successful strategy to do it did you know not only as two-thirds of the country pro-choice but there's actually not a single state where the pro-life position is in a majority even in the deeply read states like you almost never hear that on television right you almost never see that in the press that's actual polling but they may think no no no no no no pro-life they're so gigantic well you help them by pretending they're gigantic by backing up all those talking points which are not based in reality so they have Heidi Heitkamp at noir of North Dakota Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia is good candidates to vote for this kiss pic partly because they voted for Gorsuch who was massively right-wing because they have internalized a talking points that surrender shows strength and that Republican or independent voters in the red states will reward them for backing up Republican talking points no they would reward you for fighting but you won't and and and so I think it's almost a foregone conclusion anyway so Ruth Marcus of why and post on television right before the announcement saying it would be political suicide for the Democrats to fight and now I look at that and I go yeah that's like your opinion man Louise Marcus is not a bad person person who wrote this at the New York Times they're not bad people I think the day you live in a bubble anything in that bubble a democratic surrender is always the right action Republican strength is always boldness as they characterize it well what McConnell did the Merrick garland right and but so I know that they're not correct but the Democratic Party is obsessed with what did they say on MSNBC what New York Times Washington Post so when they see whose mark is saying you better give up right away although it's it's suicide I guarantee you right now they're panicked the entire almost the entire caucus is panicked and thinking about how do we make it look like we're fighting while we're not really fighting right I think I think that weak Democrats have conditioned everyone including these reporters to expect defeat and to expect weakness and individuals who refuse to actually fight for the very people that they're representing so I don't really see this as the media trying to you know push a certain narrative or push Democrats to act in one way or the other I think that they're just writing what they already predict or know is gonna happen yeah yeah no I don't think that they have any malicious intent at all I think that they're writing what is conventional wisdom in Washington and the conventional wisdom is of course the Republicans will get their way and if the Democrats there to fight back it'll backfire on them and because they believe they really do they don't realize it and I bet you they vote for Democrats but in their in their minds they think well I mean there were countries sent to write the country's pro-republican so you have to give up otherwise you lose if you have to run towards the Republican towards the right wing yeah but none of the polling indicates that on issue by issue the Democrats if they stuck to progressive positions would have overwhelming advantages but they go but the Republicans win elections well why one is because you never fight for those positions if you then you run towards the Republican positions and then choosing between a real Republican and a fake Republican they choose a real Republican you never make your own case and at number two the money in politics sways that the election is so much that it's preposterous to have a conversation about a battle of ideas when it's actually a battle of money and who could actually reach the voters more with more money and for the reporters to report it out as if that's not the overwhelming factor and there's a real test of ideas and in a red state you should go towards the right wing if you want to win misunderstands politics completely now speaking of that one last point here New York Times dutifully notes that they might also have an issue with Rand Paul because Cavanaugh was part of the Bush administration and was in favor of the interventionist foreign policy that Rand Paul is against yeah and all the reporters report this I get it again I'm not I'm trying not to be too harsh on them because that is really what is being talked about in Washington now let me tell you is my job as an analyst preposterous Rand Paul will also huff and puff and do exactly as he is told and that is what he does every time Rand Paul if he's still deciding if he's not in the signing vote then hey you could do different things if he's at the siding vote there's no way he votes no no way not even 1% chance that's a laughable and preposterous proposition so if you were doing real analysis you would say the the talk in Washington is Rand Paul might be hard to convince but here's his track record don't forget about my opinions look at this track record his track record is if he's the deciding vote he boasts with whatever Trump wants and whatever he has spoken against Rand Paul has spoken against he votes for that position every single time so no Rand Paul will not be an issue they'll hold him easily he'll go on TV you might even speak out against this opponent against us pick a little bit Maude Lee in the beginning tweak them and then run for the hills I mean in the line of questioning I'm sure that they'll be yeah a little bit of right and then he'll vote yes so overall our prediction for what happens next in this so-called drama is lots of tweaking and lots of running for the hills and probably at the end of the day unless something really strange and unexpected comes up a fairly routine and easy confirmation
