can I um Mark Latham in the fight against anti-white racism in Australia is more important than ever how do I know it's important well on Thursday of this week in the federal court in Sydney we've got the first hearing of the law fair of the legal action against me for standing up to the tweets and commentary of this bloke leftist Muslim activist Osman Farooqi there he is Osman Farooqi and of course we know what he's been putting out there it's all over the leftist media this anti-white racism in Australia we know what he's been up to he's been saying that he uses these media appearances to make fun of white people here's another tweet he refuses the whole the elevator door open for white people so a white woman comes along she has the door slammed in her face that's his attitude about civility in society and he said that in the sunscreen debate in Australia it just shows that white people don't belong here at all well we can't tolerate this we can't have a political system a society based on denigrating people because of their skin colour and he's getting worse I'm reporting that he's getting worse have a look at these tweets from last week imagine the Melbourne Cup the no horses just white people wearing dumb clothes and getting drunk in a park and even worse than that after the Sam desti re incident in the pub in Melbourne he's put out the view whose Minh Farooqi that no one is asking why people to chime in with their hot takes about what the real issue is for once just sit down that's what he's saying so he's not even allowing white people to speak about a matter in the national debate in Australia how does it come to this and I pay tribute to at least one Labour Party MP Brian Mitchell this guy the member for lines he said to Farooqi and a counter tweet replaced white people with black people or Muslims and you can see how outrageously races your tweet is well that's true that's true there's one Labour Party MP his hope for the future who stood up and made the common sense observation that if he changed the words in Farooq EES tweeter would read something like no one is asking black people to chime in no one's asking or allowing black people to chime in so this Farooq he is setting himself setting himself up as a racial master well he decides when white people are allowed to speak in the public debate it's just not on now I've stood up against this anti white prejudice in the system we've had no action out of the human rights commission 18c that useless commissioner Tim suit for Masson is as useful as pockets in your underpants that blow I've stood up against this arguing that skin color has no place in the Australian political debate denigrating white people is not going to make for a better society we've got to move past these primitive divisive debates founded on identity politics now for my troubles I'm being sued they can't win the debate all they can do is try and break me and mark Latham's outsiders financially so we've got the court action the first hearing is this Thursday in the federal court and I've been given quotes over $200,000 to defend this in legal costs minimum if it goes to trial minimum at least two hundred thousand so people will be supportive but I'm making a further appeal to go to stand with Latham comm stand with Latham calm and please back us as much as you can this is a test case for what sort of country we're going to have in the future country we're allowed to stand up and criticize people who peddle their anti-white racism or a country where sued out of existence by people who are cashed up we know the leftists are cashed up they've got get up and more corporate support than they could ever have imagined this Farooqi guys getting worse with these tweets they're sick they're wrong I'm fighting them please support me as much as you can with this federal court action and the massive legal costs that we're incurring here stand with Latham calm I'm Mark Latham and I really value your support so if you like this video please share it with all your family and friends in social media and support our platform as much as possible stay with Latham com you
