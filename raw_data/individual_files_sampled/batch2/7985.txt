let's talk about your paycheck and the possible relationship if any between the Paycheck you get each week or every other week and the 1.5 trillion dollar tax bill that Donald Trump in the GOP just passed now as I like to point out every time with any tax bill there are two things there are the things that actually happen for sure and then there's the things they say might or could or potentially should happen so what we know happened is that 1.5 trillion dollars are being taken from in some cases you in some cases government programs some we disagree with some we agree with and then it's being given to corporations in the form of lower corporate tax rates and largely the vast vast majority of it to the wealthiest income individuals in America and they're getting lower tax rates so that is definitely happening nobody questions that but we were told the whole time as we always are that we will also get a tax cut and it'll help us our tax bill will be lower and there will be all sorts of stuff trickling down on us for the next couple of years well we don't have a couple of years of data but we do have a few months so let's check in on the stuff they said might happen and see if it is actually in practice happening so our people actually when they look at their paychecks are they seeing the benefits of this tax bill well it turns out some of them are a third of Americans have noticed more money in their paychecks because of that Trump tax cut of those less than 40 percent say it's improved their finances a great deal or a fair amount which is in my view a pretty low bar to set so that's 40 percent of 33 percent which I'm no mathematician but that's 15 percent of the country says hey I notice it and it's actually beneficial for me so great success honestly fifteen percent two or three percent of that are the richest Americans in the country what percent of people who are actually middle or lower income Americans is left to make up this ridiculous paltry statistic right what I love about this is that Paul Ryan was excited about how Americans would react to their first paycheck under this new tax plan and he really thought that it would help the GOP s approval numbers just based on what people would be getting back in in the form of tax cuts but the American people were paying attention as this process was moving along and the approval ratings made it abundantly clear that no one was buying what they were selling most people including part of you know Republican voters who supported Trump knew that this was gonna benefit the wealthiest Americans and not the middle class in the working class and so the approval rating remained low and then the checks came in and the approval rating continues to be low because the benefits are not going to those who you know the Trump administration claimed would benefit the most exactly yeah yeah and a so right this is something that the American people in the main understood was going to benefit the wealthiest individuals and corporations they saw it for what it was but the rhetoric was non-stop from the right about how this is going to grow the middle class when you look at the actual middle-class numbers the amount of money that's actually being returned paycheck to paycheck is less than $15 yeah just don't it's not an amount that matters so yes it's naked ly clear that this was a money grab by the richest people in America exactly and look we till we talk constantly about income inequality and the American oligarchy these are not like things that just emerge out of the mist at some point they are created and they're created through actions like this some money that would have been yours that would've gone to services that regular Americans would have used is instead being funneled to the extremely wealthy that was the objective of it and we already know that that's how people are actually perceiving it I want to I want to tell another number because you alluded to this what should they actually notice it so the first question is are they noticing it but should they actually notice that well the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the typical middle-income household would see an after-tax gain of nine hundred and thirty dollars in 2018 as a result of the new law assuming a one paycheck household that adds up adds up to a little less than $18 a week again on average for a middle-income household and there's a there could be a broad range of what middle income actually represents a lot of people making even less than that which means that if you go up to a fancy bar you can't even get one additional drink every other week off of this tax bill and use it you could use it and that $18 a week you better not spend it on a drink you better save it because all the various ways that you're gonna be paying more as a result yes the states and local areas being starved of resources and then then passing that on to you and higher fees and all sorts of things like that the fact that your health insurance premiums and co-pays are gonna go up because they're doing everything they can to destroy the Affordable Care Act and all of that I hope $18 a week covers all of that stuff or else you're not even gonna be able to afford a Chipotle every other week right this just perpetuates regressive taxation which is what we see not just a Republican administrations to be fair you see it in Democratic administrations as well you know we already have a system where we privatize gains socialized losses but on top of that you know that tiny amount of money that you see in addition to your previous paychecks that there is a cost to that and that cost will be huge cuts in in government programs that you think you might not be taking advantage over or needing but you actually do need and have taken advantage of and a lot of other people in underprivileged situations desperately need so there's a huge cost to that $18 per paycheck that that you're receiving now yeah and so as I was thinking back to the fact that it's by my math something like 14 to 16 percent of the country thinks that they made a little bit more money and it actually makes a difference that sounds like a big problem for the GOP come the midterms let alone the fact that the vast majority of working-class and middle-class Americans aren't going to see absolutely anything but who is most likely to have actually noticed that well obviously the wealthiest percentage the hunt the hundredth percentile individual is gonna make the most from this so they're definitely going to notice it 99 a little bit less 98 a little bit less so if we aren't actually work that out according to this if you're in the 80th percentile you might well not have noticed anything if your tax bill can't even benefit some of 'literally still the wealthiest people in this country do you really think that that's gonna be enough for you to squeak out something that allows you to maintain your congressional majority I honestly don't think so this is their entire saving grace and nobody seems to be buying it at this point right but I also want to make sure that Democrats don't bet on anything like they need to not be complacent they need to give people a reason to vote for them in congressional races in local races and eventually in 2020 you know their argument can't be we're better than the other party it's not gonna work for a lot of people you need to inspire people you need to have solutions that work so don't get complete yeah that was the argument the last time in the general election and it really didn't work I mean the Democrats were swept out in record numbers uh it is absolutely the case that they need issues beyond look at those bad ideas we're not going to do that it's just a but but to your point we talked about this on TYT the fact that we were a little worried that perhaps with a little more money in their pockets early on even though as you know there's sunsets on even these these tax these tax cuts for the middle class as paltry as they are we were a little worried that was a little more money in their pockets that voters might begin to go right and that's simply because they were feeling richer but then when you actually see the numbers that John's talking about that may not have been a legitimate fear yeah and so if you look back historically how out of the norm is this sort of effect that they passed this big tax bill and then people don't really notice the benefit well I looked back and back and I think 2009 Obama I'm not talked about the stimulus here I'm talking about the make-work benefit again something like that it was a tax credit that was given to to give a little bit more money to working Americans it's passed in 2009 under Barack Obama and it was estimated that for 2009 and 2010 the average family would see about $1,200 additional income which is a good chunk more than this and the New York Times followed up and less than 10 percent of households noticed the difference right I mean they got $1,200 but even in that case most people didn't even know that it existed because of course you know we need more money than just $1,200 but so perhaps these numbers shouldn't be that surprising but also the way that they they parcel it out I think makes it even less noticeable if they gave you that $1,200 all in one year yeah you would say we just got 1,200 hours from the government but because like the stimulus exactly yeah exact right but if I remember correctly there was a stimulus under the Bush administration I think it was a $600 check and it did nothing to stimulate the economy people either saved it or tried to pay down their credit card debt so is responsible of them which was yeah exactly but I mean people were not in good financial situations at that time and also currently still aren't but yeah I mean I guess they felt it more so maybe but I mean they didn't really help Bush's approval ratings great example because that was a surplus that Bush delivered and then he essentially dropped it on everybody as Anna says at one time but it was $600 I mean what's really gonna happen and we all said that at the time what's really gonna happen with $600 but they were arguing no no no no don't underestimate $600 Americans are living close to the line and this is really going to make a difference and it didn't make a difference in the economy at all and it just it helped erase as surplus you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the
