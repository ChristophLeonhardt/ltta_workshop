just minutes to go before bunny with the
Bulls friends come from California to
Pamplona facing down danger together a
day earlier these first-timers met a
veteran runner from Colorado he's
sharing some safety advice there at
American author Ernest Hemingway's
favorite bar he made the bull running
world famous in his 1920s novel fiesta
you don't know what's gonna happen
running fast is not going to save you
I don't have to be the fastest one out
there but I have to be faster than
someone else you know
that's my big game right with the balls
going down
the ring
why already known elaborate
next morning this is that moment
half-ton Bulls 850 meters insane barely
made arena and next thing you know you
look right behind you and the polls are
right there
it was it's an epic it's like you're
running and you're looking for the Bulls
and someone's just standing there and
you just pull the flowers like oh I
didn't it started to rain
instinct said pride went out the window
I can go tomorrow there's more days of
this their photos tell of a trip they'll
never forget and this their video
postcard from Pamplona wish you were
here
