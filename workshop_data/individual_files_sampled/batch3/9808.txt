TO FoxNews.com. Tucker: WELCOME BACK. INSIDE THE ISSUE, SPECIAL EDITION OF TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. UNTIL RECENTLY BRETT WEINSTEIN WAS A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT EVERGREEN STATE COLLEGE IN OREGON. LAST YEAR THOUGH A TARGET MOM TARGETED HIM WHEN HE REFUSED TO LEAVE CAMPUS BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN. HE TOOK A PRINCIPAL POSITION AS A LIBERAL BY THE WAY. LATER HE FELT HE HAD TO RESIGN AND HE DID. HE TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS ABOUT FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS AND AFTER HE DID THAT, HE SPOKE WITH US. PROFESSOR, THANKS FOR JOINING US. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK ON. Tucker: AMAZINGLY, IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE ALL OF THIS HAPPENED. WE TALK TO YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, WHAT ARE THE LESSONS THAT YOU ARE TAKING FROM THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WENT THROUGH EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WENT THROUG THROUGH? IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IT HAS BEEN A YEAR BUT IT HAS BEEN ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR, AND MUCH HAS CHANGED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT THE CONVERSATION IS IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THAN IT WAS LAST MAY. WE ARE NOW ABLE TO DISCUSS ISSUES OF IDENTITY POLITICS, AND PEOPLE ARE STILL IN FLAMES ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT DIALOGUE. WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN A WAY THAT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE LAST MAY. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A RECOGNITION THAT THE COUNTRY IS IN DANGER, AND IT IS BEING PLACED IN DANGER BY IDENTITY POLITICS BOTH ON THE FAR RIGHT AND THE FAR LEFT. SO I SEE A MOVEMENT LED IN PART BY THE INTELLECTUAL DARK WEB AND FIRE TOWARDS WHAT I WOULD CALL A PATRIOTIC CENTER, WHERE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE OVER MANY ISSUES OF POLICY FIND THEMSELVES ALIGNED OVER BASIC AMERICAN PRINCIPLES. Tucker: YES. SO AS I RECALL, YOU ARE KIND OF CAUGHT UNAWARE BY THIS, YOU ARE ABSORBED IN YOUR ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. YOU WERE KIND OF A TRADITIONAL FREE-SPEECH LIBERAL, YOU DIDN'T FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING ON CAMPUS UNTIL YOU STOOD UP AND TOOK THE TRADITIONALLY LIBERAL POSITION THAT YOU SHOULDN'T ATTACK PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SKIN COLOR. AND YOU GOT COUNTED OFF CAMPUS AND THREATENED WITH VIOLENCE. HAVE YOU RECONCILED WITH EVERGREEN YOURSELF, HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT OR HAVE THEY APOLOGIZE TO YOU? WHERE DOES THAT STAND NOW? THEY HAVE DONE QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF APOLOGIZING. THEY HAVE HIRED A P.R. TEAM THAT QUITE OFTEN DEMONIZES MYSELF AND MY WIFE IN THE OLYMPIAN WHICH IS THE LOCAL PAPER. THINGS ON CAMPUS HAVE ACTUALLY GROWN, AS MUCH AS IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE, MUCH WORSE THAN THEY WERE DURING THE RIOTS OF MAY 2017. SO EVERGREEN STATE COLLEGE HAS TAKEN A TURN TOWARDS THE AUTHORITARIAN THAT IS NOTHING IF NOT BREATHTAKING. PEOPLE ARE BEING FIRED FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO OFFER ANY SORT OF CHALLENGE TO THE ADMINISTRATION. THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION AND ITS RECKLESS QUEST FOR WHAT IS FALSELY CALLED EQUITY ARE BEING PROMOTED, AND THE COLLEGE FACES A TERRIBLE FINANCIAL CRISIS AS A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT SHOWING UP. HAVING SEEN WHAT THE CAMPUS IS DESCENDING INTO, PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO GO ELSEWHERE TO COLLEGE WHICH HAS PUT THE COLLEGE $6 MILLION IN THE RED. Tucker: THAT IS ALSO SAD AND CRAZY. SO ALL YOU DID WAS SAY, I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE BECAUSE I'M THE WRONG SKIN COLOR. I THINK THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL CIVIL RIGHTS POSITION, AND ON WHAT GROUNDS ARE THEY ATTACKING YOU? IRONICALLY THE CHALLENGE, THE ONE THAT APPEARS TO RESONATE WITH PEOPLE FROM THE FAR RIGHT AND LEFT, AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A THREAT PHONED IN FROM A MAN IN NEW JERSEY WHO CLAIM TO HAVE A GUN AND AT ANY RATE, IT WAS IN NEW JERSEY. BUT THE ARGUMENT IS EFFECTIVELY THAT STANDING UP AND SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE WAS BREAKING RANKS IN A WAY THAT DAMAGE THE COLLEGE, BUT WHAT WAS NEVER SAID WAS THAT, YOU INVITED ME TO TALK TO YOU AND YOUR AUDIENCE AT A TIME WHEN THE REST OF THE PRESS WAS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY, AND WHAT IS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE, WHEN I WAS ON YOUR PROGRAM, THE PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE, GEORGE BRIDGES, HAD LITERALLY STOOD DOWN THE POLICE FORCE SO THEY WERE UNABLE TO INTERVENE BETWEEN WRITERS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY LIKE MYSELF. AND THE RIOTERS TOOK UP CARRYING BASEBALL BATS AND BATONS AND THEY CHALLENGE PEOPLE THAT DISAGREED WITH THEM PHYSICALLY. IT WAS QUITE A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I WAS APPARENTLY BEING HUNTED FROM CAR TO CAR BY PROTESTERS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN MIND BUT, AT A TIME THAT THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, GOING ON A PROGRAM WITH AN AUDIENCE UNDERSTOOD TO BE RIGHT OF CENTER WAS LIKE SOME KIND OF SIN. Tucker: THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. I THOUGHT THEN AND I THINK NOW,
