I'm answering the manage June 25th and you're watching battleground oh hey everybody how you doing I can't believe it it's Monday already I can't believe it it's 12:00 noon Eastern Time already thank you for joining us as you do sometimes in fact we do this every day we do this weekdays of 12:00 noon Eastern Time I just come in kibitz live for an hour and what's fun about this is it's a lot less formal than my 8 p.m. Eastern show it's not as produced we have some clips we have some websites we talked about even some tweets but really it's more interactive every night at my APM show I read a few selected letters fan mail occasionally hate mail but what's fun about this is as you can see on the right-hand side of the screen is a live chat unlimited say and do whatever you like and if you want to Google has invented something just a couple months ago called super chat where for a couple of bucks a couple of pounds a couple of kronor a couple of rupees you can make your comment in a bright highlighted color so it stands out and I see it out of the corner of my eye like my computer's right there and just sort of see the color I liqueur in my eye and I go to and if I miss it our producers in email it to me and they tell me in my ear that I'm missing something so I look for it and what's great about the super chat is YouTube shares the revenues with us it's like ads so they take a cut I think I think it's 30% that I have to check but we get the rest so we help pay the bills so it's a it's a fun way to make your comments stand out and actually I don't know if you know this but the more dough you chip in for a super chat the more characters you get in your super chatting message the longer it stays up there and obviously the more we can so it's a fun incentive to do this we talked about a lot of things because we have viewers around the world that makes it a little bit tricky sometimes there are some things that are interest to all of our viewers around the world our friend Tommy Robinson as you know used to work for us here at the rebel he left us earlier this year to independent but a couple months later he was thrown in the clink but I reached out to his family and I said look you guys let's do a little crowdfunding like we used to do and Tommy was with us we'll just do what I love and we'll give you all the dough so the family said yes if ever we got a little bit of news on that Hannah can we get that my video that I taped on Friday I've been trying to be very careful about Tommy because he doesn't work for me anymore I'm not his boss not that Tommy even has a boss he's I don't think he's I don't think he's built for bosses so I mean I don't want to be a spokesman I don't want to be the family spokesman I don't want to claim a status with Tommy I don't have I have one status with Tommy authorized by his family and of course they checked with him in prison we're doing the crowdfunding form at save Tommy calm and I'm pleased with how that's going I've talked to his new lawyers and I was behind the scenes I don't think it's a secret that I was really encouraging them to lawyer up because Tommy had a public defender at first who I'm sure he's a good guy but he didn't know Tommy and he didn't know what contempt as an expert he just didn't and the lawyer that filled in for Tommy I'm sure she's a good gal I've talked to her on the phone a few times but you need a top-flight team that's good that knows the law of contempt you just need that it's it's such an obscure area of law I mean if this were a traffic ticket or a common assault charge or something that any lawyer could do fine it's not I mean seriously have you ever heard of anyone being charged with contempt of court it's so rare it's so rare it's a specialty area of law anyway so I I was I was nudging everybody behind the scenes because if I was the boss I would have just ordered it right I mean that's what we did a year ago almost exactly a year ago Tommy got in the same sort of trouble in Canterbury I just instructed the lawyer on his behalf I didn't need to wait for him or the family to do it it took almost a month to get fed took weeks for Tommy's family and for Tommy to sort of shift directions so anyways I I spoke with his law lawyer John Carson the new lawyer and he's very careful he doesn't want to be too chatty in the press because of course he's trying to do this job in the court of law and he doesn't want to distract and he certainly doesn't want to give the court any reason to look at scan sat the appeal by saying oh this is political so the lawyer is very by-the-book but he did give me a very brief statement on Friday so what Hannah do we have that video here here is my video that I put out on Friday following my conversation with John Carson the lawyer it's not a big update but here instead of me just reading it to you are we ready with the video here we go I have a small update on Tommy Robinson's case he's filed his appeal on Friday the 22nd of June I received an email from John Carson the new lawyer retained by Tommy Robinson to fight for his freedom mr. Carson obviously is a professional and is careful about what he says to the public his goal is to do the best work possible for Tommy in the court of law not the court of public opinion so he is properly tight-lipped about his exact strategy but I asked him for a statement that I could pass on to Tommy's supporters around the world and he sent me this we can confirm that those representing Stephen Lennon have lodged an appeal against sentence together with an application for bail pending appeal we are working towards a court hearing at the earliest possible date and hope for a listing eminently okay what does that mean well first of all Stephen Lennon is Tommy's legal name just in case you were confused mr. Carson is part of a larger legal team working for Tommy they have lodged an appeal against sentence that means they are challenging the judges 13 month prison term which of course is excessive and disproportionate in my own view it's more punitive than a 13 month term for any other prisoner would be because Tommy is so uniquely endangered in the UK's prisons many of which are dominated by Muslim criminal gangs who have in the past to talk attacked Tommy last time he was in prison Tommy had to ask to be put into solitary confinement to save his own life obviously no one can survive for 13 months in solitary confinement so the first appeal is against the sentence itself the second part of mr. Carson's note indicates that he's asking for bail for Tommy to get him out of jail at least until the appeal is heard one of the craziest parts of this whole episode was that Tommy went from being scooped up on the street by seven police to prison in a few hours that's absurd he didn't even have time to properly instruct a lawyer of his own choosing getting Tommy out on bail will not only allow him to visit his family and friends but it will allow him to have proper meetings with his lawyers and the third point is self-explanatory they're looking to have this appeal hearing as soon as possible in the courts schedule so that's the update on Tommy Robinson the appeal has been lodged it's appeal of the sentence it's an application for bail and it's a request to have the hearing for all this as soon as possible when Tommy's lawyers feel it is appropriate to tell more they will and I'll be sure to let you know but I agree with their decision their public communications and the media must not interfere at all with Tommy's chances in court itself but the message here is clear finally a month after tommy was jailed he's finally fighting back if you want to support this legal appeal and I hope you do Tommy's family has authorized me to run the crowdfunding campaign at save Tommy calm you can make a donation in British pounds or in Canadian dollars which are slightly lower than American dollars 100% of the proceeds will go to pay Tommy's legal bills if there is any surplus a hundred percent of the surplus will go to Tommy's family the family has a full accounting of all money I'm going to close by reading a note from Tommy's wife Jenna who spoke to Tommy recently and she passed this on to me she wrote to me people's support of emails and your crowdfunding have given him so much hope unquote folks if you were ever thinking of helping Tommy now is the time to do it send them a note or chip in a few dollars or a few pounds it's helping the family it's helping with Tommy's legal appeal and according to his missus it's one of the things that Tommy says is giving him encouragement when he needs it the most you want to give Tommy some hope please help them in this tangible way please go to save Tommy calm let's get our friend out of prison for his sake and for the sake of freedom too well there you go why we sent that out Saturday morning I think we put up Friday night send out Saturday morning so that's the news again the lawyers don't work for me so I can't sort of say do this do that the lawyers work for Tommy he's the client we're helping crowdfund so I have a bit of a different relationship with them I can give my advice and they said but I'm I have no more standing with them than anyone else in the public my only authority is to help crowd fund for them and as you know surplus goes to the family so it's a little bit tough for to sit on my hands and not call the shots because I like to do that we've done that for Tommy before buddy this doesn't work for us now so but I feel good I feel good and you know I don't I try not to bug the family too much I you know they have a real life they don't need to be hassled by me on the other hand I don't want to do or make decisions without their approval but listen it's it's what you do it's what you do any of a buddy in jail I have had a couple of buddies to go to jail all of them for political type crimes if you can believe it and I mean I don't regard myself as a ruffian but remember that letter we read out from Tommy the other day the letter he wrote from prison where he said his own son had said at school or at home that he wants to do something bad so he can go to jail with his dad and that made Tommy so extremely sad because his son missed him so much he wanted to go to jail and he felt well if my dad's bad maybe if I'm bad I'll go to jail be put with my dad so extremely sad but would you agree with me that Tommy is not bad what did he do he reported from outside a courthouse it's it's it's not a crime now someone would say well it was contempt of court yeah but it's it it lacked the mental element the mens rea of the guilty conscience of a crime Tommy didn't rob anyone he didn't steal he didn't assault in fact he was motivated as the law would say pro bono publico for the public good do you see what I mean I mean Tommy is in jail and you could say well he technically broke a rule and that's the thing about contempt of court it's strict liability might even be absolute liability I'm not sure the the term they use in the UK which means you don't have to have meant to do it you just had to do it like we talked about this before if you if you push someone on purpose that's battery right but let's say you're in a narrow alley and you brush up against someone in the same way by accident that's obviously not a salt and battery that's that because there's no guilty mind if you if you're on a crowded subway train or if you're in a crowded street and you bump into someone by accident brushed by someone that is not assault right or battery because the you need the actus the action that's wrong but you need the guilty conscious the guilty mind the mens rea as they say in Latin Tommy had no mens rea ax Tommy had no mental guilt now I say again in contempt of court there's a strict liability you don't have to have that mental element you just you can have done it by accidents but you see how that's important because Tommy didn't do anything morally wrong and he certainly didn't do anything morally wrong on purpose in fact he was quite conscious about following the rules so how heartbreaking it is that his son would think oh my dad did something morally wrong because of course we put that's who's in jail so I have to do something morally wrong to be with my dad extremely extremely sad whenever I think about that okay I don't want to spend much more time talking about Tommy because I really don't have any Tommy news since that quote from the lawyer which I explained in that short video while that was running I looked at some comments I don't see any super chet's yet I maybe I missed some but I see a wiki gamer il says hey I thought you were supposed to be in Israel yeah I'm flying out tonight I'm flying out tonight and we've got something we call rebel Israel calm regard I don't know what 61 people joining us for a ten day tour of Israel so we're gonna see everything we're gonna go to the Gaza border meet with the mayor there we're gonna go up to the very North overlook Isis and another Hezbollah fortifications in Syria the I mean you can go I was in Israel last year right at the very very northern tip and you could see you could see Syria and Lebanon and you could hear gunfire below and our guide said it was I think he said it was Isis I can't member which terrorist group he said it was so yeah it's it's a very interesting trip for example the security fence that separates the Arab and the Jewish towns in Israel that brought terrorist attacks down by 99% we're going to it I've seen it before and what's gonna be fun is to take 60 of our friends with us the tour of that is by the Israeli Defense Forces military commander who built that which charge of that his name is Danny tearsa and he's such a good communicator and he knows fences and he knows woloson I tell you I'm just waiting for him to get the phone call from Donald Trump to go and build that wall in the u.s. oh I see out of the corner of my mind hurt my eye excuse me Tom young John says guilty mind is sometimes what gets us to behave yeah well that's the thing is because their conscience but Tommy was reporting outside that court in good conscience I'm just looking for a Mizrahi chick says safe travels Ezra thank you very much Jane Austen says did you interview Ann Marie waters yes and hen are we going to put that interview up today Tuesday so today's Monday Wednesday so I just heard in my ear hen our producer says the Ann Marie waters interview which we have recorded will be posted on Wednesday and I think we'll probably email it to all our UK supporters which is what we did with the interview I did with Gerard batten the you Kip leader so thank you for that question I'm just gonna skim a few more Tammy pretends an Bell says I wish I could have taken the time off to go to Israel yeah I'll be candid ten days is a very long time yeah you have to sort of either be retired or your own boss I guess because it's tough to take ten days off and so it's a long journey Oh question by Lauren southern who says Ezra's John taking over the show again for you a to outside of course I have two shows every day my noon hour battlegrounds show I think I'm going to try and do it at night is really haven't quite pin that down but Hannah where we're going to try and do that at night we're still working on figuring that out I'm gonna be a little tired because we're giving her all day long and I don't want to be falling asleep on the show and then gonna be jet-lagged I think it's time seven time zones different so I can't at 12:00 noon Eastern because that would be 7 p.m. and we I don't want to miss supper with our people so I think what we might look to do it is I don't know if we did it at 10:00 p.m. or I think I think it would have to be 11 p.m. local time because we're gonna hang out and smoothes there with the people who are coming so 11 p.m. out there I think that's 4 p.m. out here is that like I don't know how many people are gonna tune in I think we should give it a try I'll do my best not to be too sleepy I don't want to take a red bill Red Bull just before I go to bed but so we're gonna try and do it and as for my 8 p.m. Eastern show we've pre-recorded a bunch of in-depth interviews that we're gonna run for my show and one of those is the Ann Marie waters what are some other ones we've we had a great chat with alum Bakari he is the senior technology correspondent with Breitbart comm we're recording a lengthy interview with Andrew Clavin of The Daily wire always a very interesting fella Marc Morano one of my favorite guys climate Depot calm we had a really good talk with him weird some other ones Hannah I don't want to forget them Oh Barbara Kay of course just to use the best I really like her and oh you know what Robert Spencer from jihad watch he's got a new book coming out called the history of jihad and just stop and thinking about that the history of jihad it's just very very simple title isn't it but aren't you curious what was that she had like a hundred years ago how about 200 how about 500 how about 700 years ago and there's a little anecdote about Baltimore did I tell you to talk about that on the show I never heard of any place called Baltimore I think I talked about this on the show I never heard of any place called Baltimore other than Baltimore Maryland there's a town called Baltimore in Ireland that a Muslim slave raid went to Baltimore and basically kidnapped everyone in the whole town this Irish town and took them back and either killed or converted them and kept the women that's rape slaves a raid on Baltimore so a history they had do you have we talked about the history that you had was a phrase run amok Allah it was a very interesting interview and it's a that book sounds like a tale so that's what's going on while I'm in Israel we're gonna have we pre taped my regular 8 p.m. show so we will have a new show every day it won't be pegged to the news it'll be like feature interviews as I've just described and if I can get my act together I'm gonna do a daily battleground but it'll probably be at 4 p.m. and I guess we'll try it tomorrow right we'll try the first one some more I'll try and figure out the technology I'm not going to have the fancy set behind me it's just going to be on the webcam and hopefully a good hotel Internet so wish me luck alright enough chat about me I see some super chats have come in so let me catch up with those and read them I read Tommy young John's already Chris Hawkes chipped in 10 pounds thank you he said the left is collapsing five of the 28 EU member states have voted in right-wing governments the UK is leaving the authoritarian left us EU and there's a global trade war about to collapse the EU yes there's a lot of truth to what you say but there's also truth that the other side is not going quietly look at the resistance to brexit which is now two years old in fact I think we had over the weekend the two-year anniversary of brexit the country is still in Theresa May is slow walking it I think the Tories were bad faith when they claimed that they meant it there's a super chat I missed earlier from Craig MacDonald who said what are your thoughts on the rising tide of Alberta separation from Canada win Ontario and Quebec and win the country Alberta perpetually left out well listen I have been paying attention to Western separatism in Canada since I was a child and I read about it as a child I remember when Rennie Levesque the the great separatist premier visited Calgary and I was in high school and he was speaking at a bookstore not far from my high school and I went there I was a teenager can you believe this and I asked him when he thought about Western separatism and I was very bold because he was this premier in this fancy guy and I was this kid and he did not give me a good answer it's the day new mol of that story but I mean my point is I've been following it since I was a youngster and I would say the election of Doug Ford is good because it shows not all of Ontario is going down that not all the country's going down that insane path of carbon taxes and haters and we can have some more resistance lawful normal resistance to Justin Trudeau's agenda I think Jason Kenney is a sure bet so I think that hopefully the institutions of Canada will come in to ameliorate the imbalance the same way the Reform Party tried to and Stephen Harper tried to so if Jason Kenney Scott Moe and Doug Ford can and by the way on some issues even Quebec as we heard from Eric um the other day is coming around so I'm I I'm hopeful that we can remedy things within Canada I see mark Ella G chips in two hundred Swedish Krona I think that's what SEK means thank you thanks for keeping the rebel free speech and for helping Tommy in his fight for freedom well you're very welcome you know Tommy's a rascal he's a handful he's frustrating to work with he doesn't take orders you know or direction it's more sort of like suggestions he's a practical joker he's he's funny he's he's mischievous would you agree with me on that I think it shows through this videos he's a hard guy to you know I was his boss thousands of miles away here in Canada good luck with that I mean good luck being Tommy's boss if you're standing right there next to him but that said why is he so lovable he's such a fricking rascal he's such a handful well you know what because he's courageous and he's authentic and he care any normal human being would say why am I doing this any normal human being who has been so targeted by Islamic terrorists and at the same time by his own British police force who's been so demonized by the press and politicians any normal human being would say what am i doing let me just get out of this right I mean would you be able to go to prison again and again on trumped-up charges and then come out and keep fighting again would you I don't I mean I don't know who you are impotent I'm saying would you but would would any of us I don't know I don't know I mean I I find that fighting the power is stressful enough when you're not even in the threat of physical harm or arrest I mean I it's a stressful thing being alert and articulate and advocating even when you're not in any jeopardy Tommy is in real jeopardy and that's not just tolerable ooh he was in it put in a coma we've shown you eclipses before physical assaults on the street we know there are credible threats to his family and himself weand and i mean but let alone what the police are doing to him let alone what he's doing actually in prison prison right now so you got you got a handful he's such a handful but it's that very stubbornness that makes him so tenacious right I mean it would be quite something if someone was stubborn and tenacious and you know just never say die you know that old awful leftist song by Chung Chumbawamba get knocked down and I get up again and they're never gonna keep me down that's Tommy so it would be maybe even impossible for someone who's got that Chumbawamba can we can we throw 30 seconds of that chorus on you know the one it says yeah that's a terrible band just a terrible band but you know the song that's Tommy so if someone is that tough he's not going to be easy from a HR point of view from a human-resources but so what so what you know we're called the rebel we're not called the boring establishment so I think he was a little bit too much of a handful to work with but that doesn't mean we don't support his fight yeah give me a little bit of Chumbawamba but not too much because they're awful and it just repeats really actually this is like that takes a whiskey drink he takes a lager drink he the Nexus there's a fun drinking part to it I bet you Tommy likes that song even though there are a bunch of leftist Marxist but Tommy's got that fighting spirit don't you think and you know so we talk about him but that's because we think he's a man of history and by that I mean he shapes history will change history there's no such thing as an indispensable man graveyards are full of indispensable men but he's making a difference in his time and don't you think that we have an obligation to help especially in this one narrow thing I mean what do we do here at the rebel we crowdfund yeah it's how we started the company it's how we pay our bills and so that's the one narrow thing so I called you know I contacted the lawyers are contacted Tommy's wife I contacted other members of the family I said look we'll just help you out and they said yes so that's I don't want to overstate my relationship with Tommy I mean he's gonna get out of prison and hopefully he'll continue doing things and we'll be friends and maybe we might you know he before he went into jail he was inviting us to do something when Donald Trump comes to visit or whatever so I know maybe we'll do the odd little thing like that but Tommy's not coming back to join the rebel I don't think we won I don't think I don't think our stress level I don't think we can handle Tommy I mean God bless the guy but we'll just say it will be chummy friends and I'll always have advice for him because I don't lack opinions myself and as I've told you before the things I used to say - Tommy most often are physical security and don't get in trouble with the law and I'm not blaming him at all I think the charge and conviction and sentencing here were absurd and he absolutely didn't warrant any of that so this is not me saying told you so at all it's me saying we knew that this is the environment and so that's why we're helping out a little bit with the crowdfunding but if you haven't ripped in the crowd fund you should do that that same Tommy calm okay I see a few more contributions Keith McIntosh 100 Mexican pesos thank you comment on National Post defense of Trudeau's groping and the insider info on why no MSM aggressively tackling the story interesting that you and can sell on the same time an issue huh all right well the the reference Sarah maybe we can call up the image can we call up the image to the Creston I forget the name of the newspaper in Creston and I see there's another super chat comment by Joyce Reeves who says what motivates you humor great well enjoy see very friendly thank you I'm motivated by a smaller version of I think what motivates Tommy he's motivated because he's concerned about the death the trajectory of the world I am too I just lacked the physical courage of Tommy who's a man of the streets you know in case I go out into the world and do reporting but Tommy loves the activist so I do so we did activism year - I'm not putting ourselves down we just I mean Tommy's like a whole he's like one standard deviation more rambunctious than than anybody so thank you for the question but back to the back to the question from Keith McIntosh Justin Trudeau has never had a real life he was the trust fund son of a trust fund son son of a prime minister the last man who worked in the Trudeau family was Trudeau's grandfather who died long before he was born Trudeau inherited millions his super car alone that he inherited is worth more than 1 million dollars his super cars were about 1.5 million dollars for a car he has real estate he has servants he has trust fund managers mopping up rows so basically his whole life he led the life of a you know a young prince handsome famous last name money's no problem so he he was like a playboy by his own confession he he as a tourist went to 90 different countries like I mean that's spending your whole life as a louche privileged trust-fund boy and he loved it and in the year 2000 he went to a beer festival in Creston British Columbia which is out of the way and I think was the kokanee beer festival and so in the year 2000 so that would have been 18 years ago so he would have been 28 so he wasn't a boy wasn't a teenager he wasn't a student he wasn't yet married but he was a grown man he wasn't in politics yet but he would know enough about things and he gropes a young girl groped her beer party everyone's drunk the ratio of men to women this party was very high so he groped her let me read to you this is from a newspaper the creston advance is that the name of the paper and let me read it to the Crescent Herald sorrow so it's an editorial it CCO says open eyes quote I'm sorry if I had known you were reporting for a national paper I never would have been so forward unquote those were the words that were spoken to an advanced reporter by Justin Trudeau son a former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau August 4th Trudeau who was in Creston to celebrate the kokanee summit festival put on by the Columbia brewery apologized a day late for inappropriately handling the reporter while she was on assignment not only for the advance but for the National Post and Vancouver's son quote if I had known you were reporting for a national paper it's not a rare incident to have a young reporter especially a female reporter especially a female who was working for a small community newspaper be considered an underling to them more sorry to their more predominant associates and blatantly disrespected because of it but shouldn't the son of a former prime minister be aware of the rights and wrongs that go along with public socialism socializing didn't he learn through his vast experience in public life the groping a strange young woman isn't in the handbook of proper etiquette regardless of who she is what her business is or where they are so Manny I'll stop there my point is not only was there a groping incident as told by this reporter but Trudeau himself apologized but his apology gives it away doesn't it oh I'm sorry didn't know you were a national reporter as in you could embarrass me so yeah then there's been basically a media blackout on this story because look that hold me to thing you know you got to protect Justin Trudeau from it because you know he's too important he's like Bill Clinton it's too important to the political cause of the left to take him out just because in the case of Bill Clinton he's a rapist let me read some more and then we've got you know it's already 12 33 and I haven't even got to any of the subjects I wanted to talk about I'm going to show you the clip of Maxine Waters the US Democrat who basically said total war against Trump people wherever you find them I'm going to show you some insane tweets from Justin Trudeau's policy advisor and McFarlane's just insane and then I'm gonna tell you a little bit about the red hand in Lexington that kicked out Sarah Huckabee Sanders for the crime of being conservative so I do want to get to that but I see there's some super chats that I've missed that do mouthwash typhoon the most accurate description of Tommy ever haha well this I got to know him a bit and what are you gonna do he is who he is as I've said before it's like lightning in a bottle you can't do that it's like he's like a wild creature you can't domesticate that you know homo Tommy Robinson as' it's you know he's not like a puppy he's more like a coyote or something I should work on these analogies before trying them out on live TV no I mean listen he's great but he he's a handful to work with and he's a little bit more fun to watch than to work well he's a hoot to work with but it's it's not easy the guy's not built for corporate anything not that we're a big stodgy corporation but I think I told you before Tommy said I was his first boss he never had one before yeah I don't it's I wish someone else had sort of broken in Tommy and the whole working for you thing by the way if I sound like I regret any of it I don't it was the one of the most entertaining and exciting things we did here at the rebel and it's depressing too when most depressing things we did I told you about my regular trips to the UK I would always go there and come back just shocked with what I had seen that's not the typically mean listen go to go to London be a tourist get on a double-decker bus see Buckingham Palace see Trafalgar Square get on the Millennium Eye or whatever that's called yeah oh yeah do London have some fish and chips whatever but that's not that's something UK that's part of the UK the real life part of the UK is terrifying Chas 1422 chipped in ten bucks thank you if they refusing service or harass people at restaurants maybe it's time to respond in kind at the red hand reserved tables make small drink orders and sit for hours fight fire with fire well let me get into let me answer you a little bit more when I give a few more facts because I I don't think we wanted to send into a general civil war but but there are some things that I think are appropriately done moon man chips in two bucks and says my advice to our guys is to buy more guns and ammo I think that's always good advice for an American because not that we would use those weapons proactively and offensively but at the end of the day they do want to take your rights away from you and I part of the lesson that I've learned from the United Kingdom is when you are a disarmed population you psychologically become submissive and you accept indignities and infringement on your rights that an armed population that in the far back of their mind could you know I'm saying like one one-millionth of their mind thinks well if we really had to we could have a civil war again a Revolutionary War again not a somewhat revolutionary war it's just in the far back of their mind it keeps them a little bit more alert to freedom then I think Brits or Canadians coppa Dessau I think that's Norwegian kroner says J teams JT's names pronounced friends Justine Trudeau I think is your Stang I think that I think is roosting if my French is is right focus on yahwah says thank you for fighting for freedom on so many levels you were very reasonable for a mind and even-tempered in the face of opposition thanks for setting a good example for us all well thank you for that opinion I know there are people who disagree with you but it's very nice for you to say those nice things let me check with the team have I missed any super chance no it looks like we've got them all all right let's check the time it's 1237 and I haven't even shown you any of the video clips it's like we're doing a free-for-all Friday or something where we just take checks let me just you know there's some there's some fun regular comments here let me just read a couple of them and then we're going to show you the Maxine Waters clip and getting to it cm TMZ 2006 is the left once a civil war they will lose well they will lose if it's them versus let's say armed meat-eating Republicans but if look at the UK it's not conservatives versus leftist it's the armed state versus everyone so if the battle is between sort of anemic vegan social justice warriors on the left and good ol boys with them you know personal firearms on the right yeah but that's not what they want to do they want to tip it so it's any Authority the only lawful authority to have firearms versus the people so they're they they don't think it's gonna be you know your gender studies vegetarian studies grad student versus your you know ex-marine no they know they'll lose that so they just wanna colonize the military in the police disarmed their opponents and today you've got the UK Logan Lauren Tommy's book enemy the state is a great read laughter tears education all in there yeah he always makes me laugh I I get the feeling it was a bit of a prankster in school El Chupacabra because I wasn't Native American I don't know what that refers to okay you know what I'm just gonna there's a lot of comments there but we have to jump into the Eclipse and stuff if we're gonna get get through it cuz already 12:39 let me this goes to one of the super chats that I touched on briefly Maxine Waters who's long-standing far-left Democrat who has you know I think she's sort of dopey but she's got the patter down pat listen to her talking on the weekend about this new trend of screaming and at anyone associated with the Trump administration screaming at them and D platforming them not just the traditional leftist D platforming you can't speak at university you can't rent a conference center but now you can't even go to a restaurant here here's Maxine Waters we have to show up and if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant so it's one thing to say we stand with the children and gods on our side I write everybody says that I suppose but then to exhort people to physically accost and deep platform any Trump and when affiliated with Trump anywhere homes restaurants whatever that is a call for any kook any extremists there there you have it so they have her endorsement her imprimatur her approval her fought wise some would say to go and get as obama said get in their face get in their grill they fight back you punch back twice as hard they bring a knife you bring a gun the thing is occasionally leftist do Steve Scalise is a Republican congressman who was shot by a Bernie supporter who was whipped up by this insanity and if you listen to the left and you say okay they tell me the Donald Trump is a Nazi they tell me he's putting children in concentration camps they I saw a picture of a screaming crying girl Maxine Waters who's a very auspicious she's a senator right she's not a congressman they don't wanna get mixed up high official saying to do that I mean you've got 300 and some million Americans 300 million and let's say half roughly or on the left a little bit and maybe one in ten is engaged and maybe one in ten of those is super engaged or maybe one in ten of those would be so engaged that they actually would it cost someone so you're starting with 300 million you cut that now 150 million you're still more extreme or extreme there's still probably a hundred thousand Americans who truly believe that Trump is a Nazi truly believe he's setting up concentration camps and are so edge of saying earlier I'm agitated by the news I'm stressed up by the news imagine someone on the hard left who's agitated stressed I believe CNN and MSNBC New York Times believes that Trump is a Nazi and Maxine Waters gives them the battle-plan go out and it cost them where you see them even if there's only 10,000 true wackos and I'm not even talking about other existing assassins like a Muslim terrorist or or something like that but just weaponizing the Bernie bro left-wing freaks someone's going to get killed they tried to kill Steve Scalise and they almost did now I'm making it sound like you got to be some mentally unstable wacko with mental health issues that kind of craziness has infected the center of political discourse on the left not just in the United States but in other countries the UK don't Trump going to the UK they need more police support there to guard against leftist wackos then from Muslim wackos this 23,000 Muslim jihadists in the UK that they're trying to track 23,000 I put it to you that there are more than 23,000 leftist wackos who would do physical harm to Donald Trump if they could did you disagree with me let me show you one Canadian wacko his name is Emmett Emmett McFarlane he's sort of a middling professor of no great account but his claim to fame is that he was a policy adviser for Justin Trudeau so this is where Trudeau sometimes goes for his advice can we put up some of those Emmett MacFarlane tweets let's put up the first one here so this is about I guess I'm out of order I should have told you that saris Huckabee Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant the Red Hand we'll get to that in a minute so here's Emmett mcFarland blue checkmark of course he's a I mean he's he's sort of a I'm not gonna call him a loser he's just sort of a typical academic so I mean has it really achieved anything great he's just sort of getting older and he's just a professor and he really wants to be part of the action and this really seems like to me extremely jealous of the Jordan Peterson success story so here's what he says he says the press secretary for a white house that set up child concentration camps anyone who doesn't like me making Nazi comparisons best unfollow so you can say you're comparing the gentle spokesman for a democratically elected president bound by the Constitution in the rule of law of the country that helped liberate the concentration camps you're comparing them to Nazis that's profaning the howl he could drop this to a tweet now that's that's profaning the Holocaust that's trivializing the Holocaust we can take this off the screen no thanks because if Sarah Huckabee Sanders is no better than a Nazi than the Nazis are no worse than Sarah out to be Sanders and if being a press secretary for a controversial president aren't all president's controversial if they weren't controversial we wouldn't mean the election to settle it Barack Obama was controversial George W Bush was controversial Bill Clinton was controversial they're all controversial and we want them to be because that's how we settle our controversies in the free West through votes and elections and a perpetual media judicial chewing over everything if they weren't controversial we wouldn't we wouldn't have them so if you're comparing that to Nazism you are basically saying Nazism was no big deal it was just about difference in taste there's one more tweet from Ann McFarland so some people were saying you're wrong and he replies by saying it's 1934 and pundits are complaining that a restaurant refused to serve Goebbels Goebbels of course was the Nazi propaganda minister who called for the it was who is really in charge of demonizing the Jews and he was a war criminal he he killed himself and his whole family before capture so he was not tried on the Nuremberg trials he surely would have been convicted but imagine comparing someone who had a hand in the murder of six million Jews and millions of others to a press secretary to press secretary for the United States I said anytime you make a comparison you're saying these two things are equal so if you're saying Sarah Sanders is no better than Goebbels then you're saying Goebbels is no worse than Sarah sanders yes Goebbels was worse than Sarah Sanders yes what the Nazis did was worse than what Trump is doing and by the way every administration detains young people who cross into the country illegally especially the hands of human traffickers we do in Canada to Justin Trudeau detains children including children less than five years old he detains children for up to six months so Emmett MacFarlane is an adviser to Justin Trudeau and he seems unaware that his old boss detains children too but this just shows the Trump derangement syndrome isn't just for wacky you know imbalance Bernie bros with a gun this is a professor what do you think would be like taking a class in professor macfarland's class do you think you'd get a fair shot I mean he might call you a Nazi if you disagree with him so super gross and I think we got a little bit of where Trudeau's absurd antipathy to word from comes from I mean these are his advisors it's amazing that he doesn't personally call Trump a Nazi I haven't missed any super chance oh I think I have let me just take a really quick peak moon man all this autistic screeching will who he elected Trump well yeah I mean I saw a statistic was a Gallup or something you know you doesn't matter where that's more than 90% 90% or more of Republicans support Donald Trump now you might think well of course they do well no not always if you ask the general public do you approve of the president they're not all gonna be strictly party line there's some Republicans who are disappointed with them there's some Democrats who say no I think he's doing an okay job there's some independents who go either way so it's a good measure though of intensity and Donald Trump is the most popular president with his own party ever recorded other than the brief period where George W Bush had 90 plus percent support in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks think about that Donald Trump is as popular with Republicans as George W Bush was after after 9/11 now why why would that be I think first of all he's getting the job done 3.8 percent unemployment huge GDP growth huge economic booms tax cuts energy production North Korean peace deal like he's just getting a lot of things done I think also he's not bending the knee to these trumped arrangment extremists and I think something that's frustrated Republicans for years is how the Mitt Romney's and the John McCain's and the jeb Bush's and their Marco Rubio's of the world always blinked when some you know CNN pundit or some Vox pundit or the New York Times said do you really mean to say you're going to build a wall no no no no I didn't really mean that well Trump said yeah I say they do mean that and they're gonna have to go home now it's 520 days and Trump has some built the wall yet but people still hold out hope for it and you know what if every single thing is a Nazi moment after a while it's just noise everything is Trump's a Nazi or we're going to get Trump impeached this time you see there's this porn star who ten years ago claims to have had a consensual affair with Donald Trump and he paid her money and so you see we're gonna impeach him and just stay with me here okay with him this is Russia thing and we don't have any evidence but they had this tax guy and like every single week there's this hysteria from the media Trump is a Nazi and we're gonna impeach him any moment now you do that for 500 days in a row and people tune you out and they it's the boy who cried wolf except for in Aesop's fable the boy who cried wolf he cried wolf like three times before the wolf came and no one believed him he didn't cry wolf 300 times we have a media that has cried wolf 300 times and I wouldn't believe them if they said water was wet I would want to check for myself and so yeah I really do think I really do think this is there's a good chance that he'll be reelected because of these shenanigans moon man has another comment drum is Hitler also we need to give them our guns yes that's the inconsistency I mean and this is a concern us have to keep this in mind too I mean if we're gonna give certain tools to the government we have to be cool with those tools being wielded by the other party I believe that these social media Titans of Silicon Valley Twitter Facebook Google YouTube Amazon I believe that they have a monopoly the likes are an oligopoly the likes that has never been seen in the history of the world they have more power than JD rockefeller than Andrew Carnegie absolutely they do and we need a Teddy Roosevelt style president to bust them up well we got one his name's Donald Trump but I'm always cautious that whatever we do if we give the government certain powers well how would Obama wield them we saw how Obama will to power whether it was the IRS in the Department of Justice so we got to be careful the left ain't so careful if Trump is going to throw us all in concentration camps why do you want to give up your don't you think you're gonna need him to fight back like you know the resistance there actually was a resistance in Europe in the Second World War the partisans the resistance yeah they use guns there's even a group called Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership they use guns their whole point is that the Jews were marched to the slaughter unarmed it's so 55 we don't have a lot of time but let me show you Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweet about the incident at the red hen mm-hmm last night I was told by the owner of red hand in Lexington Virginia to leave because I work for the president United States and I politely left her actions say far more about her than about me I always do my best to treat people including those I disagree with respectfully and will continue to do so just nailed it just nailed it who looks like the Freak here and she didn't fight all right private property she didn't say oh you got a service you to make an incident now Trump has a different style can we throw Trump's tweet up there can we also get the photo it's the first photo that comes up the red hand restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopy's doors and windows badly he needs a paint job there rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside okay you take me to eat that now why is that so funny I'm sure you've got to see the humor there would you agree with me Donald Trump is not making an argument about property rights or about civil discourse or about you know divisive Nisour about you know recipes that make engaging in any philosophical argument he's saying you probably googled the redhead and looking to put the photo up you google the redhead and I have and the first photo that comes up do we have it there we go and I don't know if you can zoom in but that awning yeah at awning on the Left the one on the right looks fine but the one on the left and I've seen I've seen a bunch of pictures I grilled around a little bit it looks a little bit dirty I think yeah a little updated a little bit disjointed and yeah I think the place could you mean look sorta homey I go there that looks sure like a nice place does that I looked at the menu it looks looks pretty good actually um but Donald Trump wants to hurt them anybody you know what is a weapon he could use he could say I hate you in which case the other side would just say well if Trump hates them I love them he could do something legally that's what that's probably what Obama would do he would probably send some inspector that reminds me of John Fletcher the shopkeeper in Sunderland the police raided his family's scrap metal yard Trump smarter than that he thought well how can I really zing them I'm gonna point out a fact that everyone can check their filthy canopy he used the word filthy and put his feet back up and I'm gonna say I always had a rule if they're filthy around is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside so he's trying to say something that you can't say well Trump says it's dirty so I think it's good know know if if from if Trump said it was bad people liberals would say was good Trump's not saying is bad he's saying it's gross all right it's 1258 let me get a few the super chance either way mouthwash typhoon says when the left speak side to now faster than a dad at a Bieber concert a dad at a Bieber concert that is a great analogy same thing one says safe trip as regardless thanks very much I'm hopping on the plane today see 180 to OPR says 0-0 corrugate 16 elbows female MP Trudeau equals male famous pig 13 leadership race why didn't the great feminists step aside to allow one of the four women women running to win yeah well listen I do not believe that Justin Trudeau's a feminism his father wasn't we've shown you the other day a news story of his father Pierre Trudeau beating up his mom Margaret so badly she had a black eye and she was really weird about it she said well that just shows he loves me because he still cares and he was very macho she said we can show you that interview the time we're out of time today so Trudeau grew up in a house where his dad beat his mum I'm not saying he beat Sophie I don't think he does but I think his idea of how to treat women and what they're useful for is is warped and I think it's home male feminist thing it's just the same thing as when Harvey Weinstein said he was a male feminist it's to cover up for behavior that is exactly not male feminist same thing is Jian Ghomeshi who took Women's Studies number one to get access to women and number two oh I can't possibly be misogynist I'm a Women's Studies major okay I think that's what Trudeau is with his male feminism I think there's a lot more to come out on him you won't see it in our mainstream media though folks just want a clock on the nose it's time to say goodbye I've got my 8:00 p.m. show today and our 8:00 p.m. show will be aired all
