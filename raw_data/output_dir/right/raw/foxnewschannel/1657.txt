THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

12
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:23,621
MAYOR, WHAT WAS IT LIKE TODAY?

13
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:25,356
>> I HEARD HELP WAS ON THE WAY.

14
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:28,592
HE WAS REALLY ENCOURAGING.

15
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:29,427
AN ACTION ORIENTED MEETING.

16
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:31,429
HE HAD THEIR SHARE OF TALKING

17
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,197
ABOUT THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT SIDE,

18
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,999
HAD THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

19
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:36,233
FOCUSED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL

20
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,335
ISSUE, CHECKS AND BALANCES THE

21
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:38,569
NEED TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE

22
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:39,770
FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL

23
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,038
JURISDICTIONS.

24
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:42,173
>> Shannon: SHERIFF, I WANT TO

25
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:45,810
REVIEW SOMETHING FROM THE

26
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,577
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ACLU

27
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,346
OF SAN DIEGO TALKING ABOUT

28
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:49,980
LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING WITH THE

29
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,415
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES.

30
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,917
SHE SAID "NATIONWIDE

31
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:53,584
LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS AND

32
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:55,820
POLICE CHIEFS ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLIC

33
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,021
TRUST IS KEY TO EFFECTIVE

34
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:57,555
COMMUNITY POLICING.

35
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,056
WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY

36
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:00,257
TO REPORT CRIMES WHEN VICTIMS

37
00:01:00,257 --> 00:01:01,025
AND WITNESSES.

38
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,626
THEY MAY BE DEPORTED IF THEY

39
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:03,461
CONTACT LOCAL POLICE.

40
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:04,795
IT'S AN ARGUMENT WE HEAR A LOT."

41
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:07,932
WHAT'S THE REALITY OF THE IMPACT

42
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:08,699
OF THE CENTURY STATE LAWS ON

43
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:12,503
YOUR ABILITY TO DO YOUR JOB AS A

44
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,205
>> THE IMPACT IS THAT THIS ENTRY

45
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:16,207
STATE LAW PROTECTS CRIMINALS,

46
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:17,641
NOT VICTIMS AND WITNESSES.

47
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,443
THAT IS THE BIG PROBLEM.

48
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:21,212
THE BIG MYTH THAT SOME OF THE

49
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:23,013
VICTIMS AND WITNESSES ARE BEING

50
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:23,614
TOLD.

51
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:24,849
THAT MAKE THEM AFRAID.

52
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,518
SO THE SANCTUARY STATE LAWS SAYS

53
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:29,420
THAT WHEN SOMEBODY COMMITS A

54
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,222
CRIME, GETS ARRESTED, AND GETS

55
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:34,191
BOOKED INTO A COUNTY JAIL, I AM

56
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:34,859
PROHIBITED FROM TALKING TO

57
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:35,860
I.C.E. ABOUT SOME OF THOSE

58
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,829
INMATES IN MY JAIL.

59
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:39,663
NOTHING ABOUT VICTIMS AND

60
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:40,030
WITNESSES.

61
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,800
IN FACT, WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT

62
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,135
INTO TRYING TO REASSURE PEOPLE

63
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:45,803
IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT IF YOU ARE

64
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:47,438
A VICTIM OR A WITNESS TO A

65
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:48,606
CRIME, I CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU

66
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:51,609
BE HERE LEGALLY BY RECOMMENDING

67
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,377
A VISA THAT GIVES SOMEONE A

68
00:01:53,377 --> 00:01:56,213
THREE YEAR LEGAL RESIDENCY IF

69
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:58,616
THEY REPORT THE CRIME AND ARE

70
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,251
INVOLVED IN THE PROSECUTION.

71
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,219
SO THAT IS COMPLETELY FAKE.

72
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:02,620
IT'S A MYTH.

73
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,256
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S CAUSING MORE

74
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,957
FEAR IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

75
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:07,358
VICTIMIZED.

76
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:10,026
>> Shannon: YOU HEARD IN THE

77
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:10,761
REPORT, TRACE GALLAGHER TALKED

78
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,395
ABOUT HOW GOVERNOR BROWN

79
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:14,231
RESPONDED TO YOU BEING THERE.

80
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:14,932
YOUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN

81
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:19,537
NEWSOM SAYS "CUTE MEETING,

82
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:19,970
DONALD TRUMP.

83
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,973
CHERRY PICKING A FEW RIGHT WING

84
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:23,841
ELECTIVES."

85
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:25,209
SINCE YOUR TEAM DIDN'T BRIEF YOU

86
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,211
COME HERE ARE THE FACTS.

87
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,412
SANCTUARY COUNTIES HAVE FEWER

88
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:30,414
CRIMES, HIGHER MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD

89
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,916
INCOMES, LOWER POVERTY, AND

90
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,450
LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT.

91
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,885
MAYOR, IF THAT IS THE CASE, WHY

92
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:37,221
ARE YOU FIGHTING BACK?

93
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,256
>> I AM HOPING HE ISN'T REALLY

94
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:41,258
TELEGRAPHING WHAT COULD COME IF

95
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:42,059
HE WAS TO BE ELECTED AS

96
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:42,493
GOVERNOR.

97
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,829
WE ARE HOPING FOR A GOVERNOR WHO

98
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,663
WORK WITH US.

99
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:46,831
WE ARE BIPARTISAN ON

100
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:47,264
CITY COUNCIL.

101
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,933
WE HAVE TO WORK WITH BOTH SIDES

102
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,634
OF THE AISLE.

103
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:52,369
WE ARE REASONABLE, NOT LOWLIFE

104
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:53,504
LIKE GOVERNOR BROWN CALLED US.

105
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:56,707
BUT WE ARE HOPING TO DO IS LEAD

106
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:57,107
BY EXAMPLE.

107
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:57,842
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

108
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,343
UNITED STATES INVITED THE PEOPLE

109
00:02:59,343 --> 00:02:59,910
BACK TO THEIR HOUSE.

110
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,147
HE INVITED CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

111
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:04,615
ONE OF THE SMALLER CITIES IN

112
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:06,116
ORANGE COUNTY, THE SHERIFF, A

113
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,017
BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

114
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:09,286
HE WANTS TO HAVE A DIALOGUE.

115
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:10,821
HE WANTS TO GET FEEDBACK.

116
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,423
LIKE MELISSA MELENDEZ SAID, WE

117
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:14,124
WOULD WELCOME A DISCUSSION WITH

118
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:14,592
GOVERNOR BROWN.

119
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:17,761
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE

120
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:19,497
ATTORNEY GENERAL XAVIER BECERRA,

121
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:21,832
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN OPEN

122
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,933
FORUM WITH HIM.

123
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,235
HAVE THEM COME TO A LITTLE CITY

124
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:25,736
WHERE HE CAN BEAT UP ON SOMEONE

125
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:28,239
WHERE HE DOESN'T FEEL AS

126
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,306
PREPARED AS A BIPARTISAN PERSON

127
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,674
DEALING DIRECTLY AT THE RETAIL

128
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:31,775
LEVEL IN POLITICS.

129
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:32,643
WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

130
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,245
IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE.

131
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,045
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT.

132
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:36,614
THEY WANT LAW AND ORDER.

133
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:37,882
>> Shannon: WE TOOK THE SHOW

134
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,683
OUT THERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS IN

135
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:40,084
LOS ANGELES.

136
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,418
WE WERE ALL OVER THE STATE

137
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:42,586
TALKING TO PEOPLE, SEEING WHAT

138
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:43,320
WAS GOING ON.

139
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,657
A NUMBER DON'T LIE.

140
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:48,425
INDEPENDENT STUDIES SHOW HIGH

141
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:49,059
POVERTY RATE, THROWING

142
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,262
HOMELESSNESS, CRIME ISSUES,

143
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,431
FISCAL ISSUES AS WELL.

144
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,566
SHERIFF, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING

145
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,034
FROM PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY

146
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,436
ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT WHAT'S

147
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,472
BEING DECIDED IN SACRAMENTO BY

148
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:03,240
THE TOP AND HOW IT TRICKLES DOWN

149
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,941
IN YOUR COMMUNITY?

150
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:05,142
>> WHAT I'M HEARING IN MY

151
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:06,710
COMMUNITY IS GREAT SUPPORT FOR

152
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,314
FIGHTING BACK ON THE SANCTUARY

153
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:10,748
STATE ISSUES.

154
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,016
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US TO

155
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,417
BE ABLE TO HAVE OPEN DIALOGUE

156
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,220
WITH OUR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

157
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,021
PARTNERS.

158
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,656
WE LEARNED THAT AFTER 9/11.

159
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,225
WE LEARNED HOW IMPORTANT

160
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:21,959
COMMUNICATION AND RELATIONSHIPS

161
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,226
ARE.

162
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,662
AND NOW HERE WE ARE YEARS LATER,

163
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:25,262
AND PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE

164
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:28,198
FORGOTTEN THAT MESSAGE.

165
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,300
AND IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING TO

166
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,567
ME.

167
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,569
I'VE BEEN SHERIFF NOW FOR 12

168
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:32,803
YEARS.

169
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,238
AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE I KNOW

170
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:37,808
WHAT MY COMMUNITY WANTS, AND

171
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:40,210
THEY WANT THE RULE OF LAW.

172
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,112
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT OUR

173
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:43,380
HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS OUT THERE

174
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,215
NOT COMMITTING CRIMES.

175
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:46,417
WE DO NOT ASK VICTIMS OR

176
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:47,418
WITNESSES OF CRIMES THAT THEY

177
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:49,286
ARE HERE ILLEGALLY OR NOT.

178
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:50,721
MY CONCERN IS WHEN SOMEBODY GETS

179
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,389
ARRESTED AND BOOKED INTO OUR

180
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:52,990
JAILS, WE NEED TO HAVE

181
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,558
FREE-FLOWING INFORMATION GOING

182
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:58,195
BACK AND FORTH.

183
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,229
WITH I.C.E. IN OUR JAIL

184
00:04:59,229 --> 00:04:59,630
POPULATION.

185
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,464
>> Shannon: YOU MENTIONED THAT

186
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:01,465
THE WHITE HOUSE YOU'RE WORRIED

187
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,233
ABOUT HAVING AN MS-13 GANG

188
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,835
MEMBER AND NOT BEING ABLE TO

189
00:05:04,835 --> 00:00:00,000
TELL FEDERAL AGENCY HAD SOMEONE
