not every picture tells the story not every image is worth a thousand words but the right one in the right place time and context can pack a bigger punch than a hundred sound bytes for a million tweets an image like this one athletes from two countries entering the Olympic stage under one flag it's a great photo-op it makes for some good pictures it does sort of bring the sense of potential in the sense of optimism at least briefly for that sports event but it doesn't necessarily mean unification is around the corner of course there's an element of spectacle to it but it was also meaningful I think you demonstrated that the two Koreas are trying to work something out at this moment one in which the North Koreans have developed a nuclear program now there's a lot of tension between them and the international community and just having that group walk in together doesn't erase all of that so you know it is a moment that suggests hopefulness and a lot has been said about the u.s. vice president Mike Pence and his wife choosing to remain seated while tens of thousands of spectators including North Korean and Voice and the South Korean president were standing up and applauding wildly Mike Pence came across as grumpy boorish insensitive actually quite offensive if a charm offensive is to work the recipients must be open to persuasion and it helps if they're gullible Pyongyang will have been pleased with the way the Western media received kim yo-jong kim jong un's sister with the world watching the Olympics she will put a young telegenic face on the regime there is no denying the significance of her presence at the games given that kim yo-jong is the first member of north korea's ruling family to ever visit the south but before falling under her spell western news outlets might have done some homework and considered her day job propaganda is what kim yo-jong does as the head of North Korea's department of propaganda and agitation she does run a very important department that department makes sure that North Koreans have few if any real access to outside information that they remain in the dark and that department also does its best to restrict the flow of information out of North Korea none of that was broached in reporting on kim yo-jong only the fact that she exuded the softer image that she smiled for the cameras that she looked modest and sincere the appearance of the kim yo-jong may be seen as a more propaganda show to may create more peaceful more loving images of North Korea but from the viewpoint of the inter-korean relations this is a very important political breakthrough given that she was the first that Korean ruling family members visit to the South Korea so in that way it's a very very meaningful political breakthrough in Pyeongchang kim yo-jong became the temporary face of an authoritarian country that is politically dominated by men Kim jong-un represents the third generation of a family dynasty a patriarchy that has lasted for 70 years but when North Korea ventures onto the world stage and in front of the news media women do a disproportionate amount of the PR work in addition to kim yo-jong the government sent more than 200 cheerleaders to the games it's not the first time they've been sent out but journalists can't seem to resist them the cameras were drawn to the women like moths to the Olympic flame the media again a male-dominated media is just all over them desperate to try to get a response from them you see it's sort of a game in the South Korean media - can you get one of them to answer a question because they are really quite tight-lipped other than when they're cheering in a way it's almost a propaganda failure because of how regimented and organized they appear it can look a little bit weird sometimes a little bit sort of stiff it's sort of what you would expect from Western media because they really like this narrative and especially like the cheerleaders really fit into the caricature that they've built of North Korea this idea of it's this Potemkin village and their fascination with how synchronized they are and how brainwashed they are and how controlled they are support staff surround the cheering squad the athletes the archery all of the delegation would be under 24/7 surveillance he says they wouldn't be able to go to the bathroom alone and it sort of revealed how little the Western media knows about either Korea and how little they understand about the situation in home the international news media treat North Korea as a potential geopolitical flashpoint media in South Korea see the North differently as an existential threat news outlets based in Seoul are typically split along liberal and conservative lines liberal outlets are more open to accommodating Pyongyang conservative ones are usually much more hardline but on this story and the bilateral meeting between kim yo-jong and the south korean president moon jae-in the ideological gap in the south seems to have shrunk because of mistakes the Arsenal's and the players involved not all of whom are career on the left you have editorials cheering moon jaein on saying this is a very important moment of outreach and possibly a bigger breakthrough on the right instead of being critical of moon jaein editorials are saying things like this is good just be careful the gap between left and right is relatively narrow I think because South Koreans generally are very worried about the United States right now we think the Olympics will go very nicely and after that who knows we'll find out that President Trump is way too willing to risk war on the Korean Peninsula so there's sort of a unity of opinion across the board left and right looking for a way to defuse tensions and move on most of South Korean newspapers and South Korean TV features that the glitt'ring between South Korean president important breakthrough in angle chun sang-gui tomorrow to meet hawaii underseater ninja another korean war will break out then south korean people is the one who saw for most I saw any kind of sign any kind of gesture from the north to communicate with South Korea is have to be seen as a possibility that no other way the wall-to-wall coverage of this story comes with cracks significant gaps in understanding the South Korean media know little about what goes on in Pyongyang the international media don't know their way around either country either story and the vast majority of journalists parachuted into the Olympics are sports reporters unschooled in the world of geopolitics for the Kim's of North Korea this was more than a photo opportunity it was a propaganda opportunity and they took it you
