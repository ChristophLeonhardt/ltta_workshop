Höller is one of very few 
artists who have introduced
the idea of play as an active element
of a work of art.
The "Revolving Doors" sculpture
have large handlebars,
which is really an invitation
to the public to engage with it.
Seven huge models of flying agaric 
mushrooms, which is a sort of mushroom
that you eat it, you have a trip, 
a kind of hallucinogenic trip.
These mushrooms as you push this machine, 
the mushrooms literally start to fly.
And live up to their botanical name.
Carsten Höller is a unique artist
because he came
from a completely different field,
which was the field of biological science.
