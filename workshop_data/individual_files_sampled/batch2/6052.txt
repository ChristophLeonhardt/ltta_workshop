Tucker Carlson another example of a ridiculous response to the shooting he has been angry at the media in general because he believes that the media makes too many generalizations about things particularly generalizations in regard to white men after mass shootings happen now if you look at the statistics in the United States the majority I'm not making this up you could look for yourself the majority of mass shootings that are carried out in the United States are often perpetrated by young white males and he hates the fact that people bring that up and so he decided to make generalizations following this YouTube shooting take a look now let's pause for a moment and pretend this is not the 8:00 p.m. show on Fox News let's pretend it's somewhere else on the dial maybe CNN or MSNBC are actually any other cable channel or newspaper in America if that were true by definition we'd have to draw hard and fast conclusions from this tragedy using a limited fact set available we don't really know much at this stage but sweeping dumb generalizations are what the media do so we would do that and of course we need a very specific script in order to make those generalizations so what we conclude from what happened yesterday well first off the shooter was a woman she was female so clearly America has a problem with toxic femininity and we need to address that crisis right away starting with more University panel shaming an entire gender somebody alert the HR department to this and then there's the gun we focus relentlessly on the gun because nothing is more pivotal in a shooting than the weapon that was used it's always the guns fault always and you know what to be fair to Tucker Carlson he would never make generalizations I mean just take a look at the rundown of the types of comments that he's made in the past I mean let's be honest if you were to do an actual measure of racism Mexico is a formal racist country that in the United States I mean the last four presidents have all been white people who went to Harvard or Yale but we don't need to just sit back and stand by while people take advantage of our of our lack of a secure border right so 60,000 emergency died last year from drug Odie's and most of those drugs came from Mexico so they're a hostile country they're abetting the movement of these people here why I understand why Mexico wants to export its ports the United States I'm sure if we could export our poor to Canada some people would be in favor of it not me but some unfortunately our leaders are gonna tell us that acts of terror does something that happens like the weather just accept it and move on there is nothing you can do or better yet just pretend it's not happening all around you tomorrow thousands of activists will descend on Washington to demand that you be punished for crimes or others committed it's called the March for our lives and it's designed to lobby for new gun control legislation across the country I'm coming to conclusion that feminism isn't sincere just run that out there you would never make generalizations he's really above that yeah so it's not that we don't understand the setup we do oh if I was on MSNBC or CNN I would say this but you see if they were to talk about toxic masculinity how yeah by the way that's a phrase I don't love we've discussed that postgame for the members by the way tea white tea network.com slash join to become a member and catch those post games but but if they were to apply that to male shooters well the overwhelming majority of mass shooters are male hence there would be some logic in it now I would disagree and I wouldn't want a profile men any more than I'd want to profile Muslims or right-wingers who do the majority of terrorism in this country and it's not fair to lump those radicals in with all the right wing in this country which is about 45% of the country right so but say hey is this an issue that we should discuss I mean that's what Fox News does all the time in fact as Anna showed you in that clip right there after one terrorist attack presumably a Muslim one tear cross it was like we got to do something about terrorism we got to talk about the Muslims and what's there going on here but but if you say about about men he'll say oh no I can't believe they're bringing up toxic masculinity so but saying that doing likewise is when you have one female shooter to pretend that's the same thing and the equivalent would be talking about toxic femininity is this a genuine right exactly it and I want to reiterate even though you know the majority of these mass shootings that happen in in the country are done by young white males as far as I know no one on this network has ever advocated for anything that would take away white males rights or you know discriminate against them or make them feel disenfranchised that's the whole reason why we bring that up is because there is a double standard and the double standard is you have some members of the media specifically those on Fox News who love to make generalizations about an entire population of people based on you know incidents that happen in the US or abroad and so it's just hilarious how he misrepresents everyone else while he sits there and does exactly what he accuses other people of doing no one on this network would be stupid enough to say that even though a majority of the terrorism in America is done by right-wing here's that part is true that we got a ban all right where yours in the country until we figure out what the hell is going on until we figure out what the hell's going on just ban them all if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now tea why tea network.com slash join
