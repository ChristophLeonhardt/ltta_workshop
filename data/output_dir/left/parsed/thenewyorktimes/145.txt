This crab spider is not
just scuttling around.
It is thinking about flying.
Once on top of this
artificial dome,
it raises a leg to
sample the airflow.
Once it’s satisfied,
it raises its abdomen,
turns on its spinnerets — 
the silk-making organs —
and shoots threads
skyward until it launches.
It’s called ballooning,
but the spiders hang only
from their own silk threads.
Incredibly, these
spiders are known
to ride the wind across
oceans and can reach
heights of a mile or two.
And sometimes, so many
spiders launch together
that the ground becomes
blanketed with spider silk.
Spiders use ballooning to
seek food, avoid danger,
find a mate.
But much is still
unknown about the physics
of spider flight.
And that’s what drew
Moonsung Cho to study them.
Here he is in Berlin.
You can see the path a
ballooning spider takes
after launching
from his finger.
Cho has carried out
dozens of tests in nature.
But for detailed analysis,
he took spiders to the lab
where he tested them
in a wind tunnel.
The researchers found that the
spiders prefer mild breezes.
And the silk they spin can
measure up to six feet long.
Amazingly, it seems
to be not the breeze,
but what you might think of
as the stickiness of the air
that holds them aloft.
Imagine a thread suspended in
a thick fluid, like a syrup.
It won’t sink.
And if the fluid
is moving along,
the thread moves with it.
A strand of silk may be more
than a thousand times thinner
than a human hair.
So for spider silk,
the air is that fluid,
moving swiftly along to
take the spiders far afield.
These spiders don’t need an
actual balloon to fly,
just their own amazing silk.
