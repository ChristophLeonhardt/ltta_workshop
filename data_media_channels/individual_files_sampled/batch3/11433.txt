the US ambassador to the UN reacted to the wave of criticism by doubling down insisting that America's view simply reflects the way the world is when you recognize the truth when both parties recognize reality peace comes we are living in the reality that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel president Trump's announcement last week was at odds with the rest of the United Nations in late November UN members voted a hundred and fifty one to six to reject gruesome status as the capital of Israel and lost Wednesday the secretary-general stress that there is no alternative to a two-state solution where we're going to discuss this issue further with therapists and political analyst Gina Loudon welcome to the program Gina we'll start with the decision great to have you the decision by the u.s. seemingly already causing unrest in the Middle East surely the Trump administration must have expected that well has the wife of a former state senator from Missouri I can tell you that you always know that about half the people are going to agree with every decision and half the people are going to disagree with every decision but that's why leadership is so important in this particular arena especially and I think that not only citizens of the United States but I think citizens worldwide are glad to see leadership and decision-making on some of these issues that have been so precarious and bizarre for so long yeah you know it's caused a lot of uproar hasn't it in the international community and obviously in the Middle East itself now the Czech president me lost salmon they've accused the EU of cowardice for refusing to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's our capital do you think he's got a point you know it's it's I think it's not in the business of countries to judge what other countries say about a decision that has obviously been made by the United States president a decision that most Americans in fact support and as your news reel they are demonstrated that is historically a current as well as Nicola as nikki Haley said the president is there the Prime Minister is there the Supreme Court is there historically the evidence is there it makes sense that Jerusalem is the capital what about the timing though Gina Trump he promised to recognize Jerusalem during his campaign and yet has taken him almost a year why now do you think well is yeah well he's been busy he's gotten a lot done look at all the things that have changed I mean the United States economy is a just by all measures doing well I can't think of anything happening in the United States that's on a downward trend right now unemployment is down jobs are up even places that traditionally you know blue-collar Americans working Americans where they didn't have jobs those jobs are up Isis is being defeated I mean there this president has been very very busy and I think most of the people like myself who campaign for him and supported him throughout the the entire time he campaigned they're glad to see him keeping his promises and they were realistic and knew that they couldn't all be kept within the first couple of weeks or months of his presidency so I think that they're probably just glad that he's keeping his promises because as you know what politicians that's not so normal they don't always keep their promises this president is okay Gina Loudon political analyst and therapist great to have you on the program and to have your thoughts on this issue Thanks great to be with you I think the wave of protests sparked by Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has now reached Belgium pro-palestinian activists took to the streets of Brussels to show their discontent demonstration came during the Israeli Prime Minister's visit to the EU Capitol artis an associate Joe Cana reports from decision on Jerusalem is clearly continuing to stir up trouble especially as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes now to visit Europe first for talks with the French president Mark Hall as well as for talks with his EU colleagues specifically EU foreign policy chief margarita as well as European for ministers now he was matched by protesters in Belgium and in France yet Netanyahu expected it seems his European counterparts to follow in Trump's footsteps he did expect some kind of support when it comes to this issue even having thrown around the word hypocrisy but we have seen that the youth foreign policy chief mogherini has basically indicated that Netanyahu should hold his horses when it comes to the issue of Jerusalem saying that quote here he should keep his expectations for others we've seen quite a similar story unravel in Paris with the French president McCune where both macro and Netanyahu did talk about peace however it was quite clear that their vision of the path towards this peace is completely different it's always been our capital and Jerusalem has never been the capital of any other people I think the sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality the sooner we'll move towards peace and this is why I think President Trump's announcement was so historic and so important for peace she expressed to Prime Minister Netanyahu my disappointment of the u.s. presidents declaration and explained that France Caesar as a country to international law and as dangerous for peace because it doesn't seem to serve in the short term the cause of security for Israel and for the Israelis themselves to be clear Netanyahu has not really received a lot of support on this issue from other leaders in Europe along them of course German Chancellor Angela Merkel and here in the UK British prime minister Theresa May has also made it quite clear that this is not an idea that is very popular here and that both Merkel of course and may have made it clear that they don't think this announcement is going to be good in terms of this decades-long attempts to try to come to some kind of viable solution to the israeli-palestinian question now here in London we've also seen the Metropolitan Police as well as emergency services conduct some kind of training for the first time in a foreign embassy and this was an Israeli embassy they where they were basically trained in preparation for a chemical attack they were saying that this was has thing to do with the latest developments when it comes to Jerusalem and also in Europe really passions have been flying when it comes to this issue left and right there been several instances for one we've seen in Sweden a couple hundred protesters come out onto the streets with anti Israeli messages we've seen in another lens an attack took place at a Tralee restaurant by a man carrying a palestinian flag really other examples as well so it's clear that this is an issue and this announcement from Trump has so far really just stirred a lot of trouble political activists and social justice campaign that George Bardo believes the change in US policy could have a destabilizing effect on the Middle East what is absolutely clear is that the Trump's move is an incredible provocation to what is an incredibly unstable situation has had a lid kept on it by the pretense if you like of of the idea of a two-state solution with the US as a broker of peace but that I mean that is a more ridiculous claim than it has been for a very very long time and another thing that I've been saying for a while and along with many others is that a huge danger with Donald Trump is that when his when his sort of national divide and rule politics begin to break down and his sub-national issues start to catch up with him there's a huge danger that he'll start inflaming and provoking tensions across the world to distract from that national context and I think that's what we're seeing at the moment
