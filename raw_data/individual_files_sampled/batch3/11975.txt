hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter labelled war in remembrance today marks the 73rd anniversary of victory in Europe over fascism this is one of the most important dates on the Russian calendar that can't be said of the Europeans and Americans we discussed how that conflict continues to impact Russia's view of the world to this day Krauss sucking the Great Patriotic War I'm joined by my guess mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also having said the Amuro he is a founder of the center of political strategic analysis strat poll and we have Peter kuznick he is a professor of history at American University as well as co-author with Oliver Stone the untold history of the United States all right gentlemen cross thought girls in effect that means he can jump in in any time you want I always appreciate it let's talk about what the Russians call the Great Patriotic War or as the rest of the Western world calls it the Second World War no Peter you've been visiting Moscow you've probably seen a lot of evidence celebrating the Victory Day on May 9th but you don't see that in the West you don't see that in the United States why the significant difference one big difference is that the Soviet Union lost 27 million people how many people in the West know that well actually I've got some statistics on that I did an unofficial unscientific sampling of my students undergraduates not history majors and I asked them how many Americans died in World War two the median answer I got was 90,000 which means they were only 300,000 off okay that's not bad that's in the ballpark I asked my university students to the universities do this mostly freshmen fall off your chairs yet then I asked them how many Soviets died of World War two and the median answer I got was a hundred thousand which means that they were only 27 million off so these kids know nothing not only about World War two they can't understand what's happening in Ukraine they can understand anything that's going on between the United States and Russia now there is an extraordinary degree of ignorance in the United States about World War two okay it's not is that intentional ignorance yeah I think it is I think there is a deliberate role both officially from the US government dominant within the US media and particularly perpetuated by Hollywood of the role that the u.s. played the YouGov put out a poll just this year asking the question to the US and six seven European states in your opinion which one country would you say contributed most to the defeat of Germany and World War two most Americans surprised believe that they played the biggest role by 55 saving the Private Ryan France most French this is a big change from right after the war right after the war 57% of French believed that the Soviet Union played the biggest role in the defeat of Nazi Germany today 47% the plurality believed that the United States played the biggest role while only 15 in Germany a plurality believe the United States played the biggest role by 37 to 27% in the UK they believe that they played the biggest role by 50% god bless their souls Denmark Sweden Finland in Norway also a plurality believe that the u.s. well that'd be okay but that's a function of the Cold War that's a function of NATO I would say it started it started just after the second world war actually and especially for for Germany because if you remember Manstein who is a real nicest okay it was not as a legend he created himself after the Second World War it was not loyal officer of air marks it was earnest in a Hitler and in the Nazi Germany but he was advisor for the Bundeswehr for the West Germany army either the chief of staff of the German army in the 1940 it was advisor from that too it's one of those interesting things that you had good night Albert spare the good Nazi okay and then you whitewash the rest of it okay you know one of the most important things the legacy of the Second World War we have the division of Europe we have the Cold War but on the bright side we have the establishment of the United Nations Charter and I think that's really significant speed up to the present I think mark how many posture reports is Trump gotten three I think already China Russia Iran North Korea they're the revisionist powers I would pause it in light of the establishment of the United Nations Charter and in light of what's going on in Syria it's the Western powers though the revisionist powers if you put it next to the United Nations Charter we have the French we have the British and the Americans going all the way back to 1918 Sykes Puka picot in deciding the fate of of Syria in the Middle East bypassing and they say it's legitimate bypass of the United Nations Charter Peter that we're going backwards and we're not learning some of the very few good things that we got from that conflict that ended in 1945 the first item on the agenda for the United Nations was nuclear disarmament to make sure there wasn't a third man there's only been 72 years we haven't gotten exactly close to that I mean the real purpose of the United Nations has never been achieved and the potential for the United Nations has never been achieved but during World War two Roosevelt had initially a different approach in 42 he asked Stalin to set Molotov and a trusted general to Washington in late May of 42 and that's when Roosevelt promised to open up the second front in Europe before the end of 1942 and it's also when Roosevelt said what we need after the war is four policemen that the United States Russia Britain and China should get together and we should maintain world peace security stability and that was a vision that clearly was never put into effect but we need leaders now who are going to act upon that kind we have a deficit of leaders we have institutions under attack it's worse because actually there is a will from the West to twist the idea of the International structures and not only you got every kind of structure it could be to Doping agency it could be anything to just want to make this structure where which were created and I think it was a good thing just after the war to avoid future Wars they want to use it as an instrument of the the foreign policy and that it's very dangerous well what we have here is and I've said this many many times on this program I really adore the term used in the West the international community what does it mean it means NATO membership Japan Australia New Zealand Israel again this is abbreviation of the vision that was supposed to come about with the end of that most horrific war which given the statistics given us most Western public's forgotten her I've never been taught if you allow me the speech of a macron Honoria which is our foreign minister just after they bombed Syria was incredible telling that it's you know it's they are not not talking about lately legged legality because it's not legal absolutely not but legitimate II Galloway and also oh you can define it did for you that is a return to just war yeah exactly of you know the late medieval period in in the West in in the halls of government academia and the media which all echo they continually talk about Russia and sometimes China as revisionist or revanchist powers against they don't there's two different World Order's we're talking about they refer to the liberal world order not to the UN established World Order they're talking about the world order that they believe started with Bretton Woods and continued up through the collapse of the Soviet Union and came to its biggest height of uni polarity of us-led Western hegemony during the 1990s and what they're talking about is Russia and China returning to positions of great power status in the world are bucking their control of the world whereas Russia and China and I'm not going to stand for it okay from a realist perspective and of course from a relativist position of weakness still to the US prefer the rules bound system 1945 established by the UN whereas the US regards the principle UN principle the Security Council principles UN Charter principles of sovereignty and non-interference to be antiquated policies okay well I think you're paraphrasing mr. John Bolton there you know Peter one of the things one of the biggest problems and we'll talk about Russia's relationship with the West in the next part of the program but I think one of the biggest problems is that you have policymakers and media in the West that can never put themselves in Russia's shoes to look at how they see the world you know NATO has demonstrated that it is it will pursue policies that are beyond the bounds of international law meaning that it leads it rises above it and we got the legality versus legitimacy issue here I mean the Russians see NATO expansion is a threat okay and they there are you know here we are in 2018 and we have American and other NATO countries having their militaries on Russia's borders I mean this is the worst nightmare for for the Russian leadership considering today it's focusing on what happened in June 1941 Gorbachev got a promise in 1990 when he allowed the unification of Germany that NATO would not expend one thumbs with to the east and then they started to hedge on that and hungry we might be like what's what interesting I'm sorry but you know but then now NATO has expanded 13 countries to these doubled its membership since Leanne Abela but the real turning point came in 2008 when George Bush said we want to expand to Ukraine and Georgia and that was passed russia's redline and they when booting has not allowed or he can't really stop it but he stood up to it and what's happened since has made this a very very dangerous world beginning with syria and the u.s. involvement in Syria and the Syrian civil war and what happened in Ukraine and they're very conscious effort to rest Ukraine from the Russian orbit and and what we've seen now with not only with NATO but with the nuclear confrontation increasing Putin's March first State of the Nation Address announces five new nuclear weapons that can all avoid America's ballistic missile defense program but there was the olive branch of let's sit down and talk we haven't heard a response for that well we're gonna jump I'm gonna jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real new state with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle to remind you we're discussing some real news okay something you want to finish up on this promise that was made to go to poach off that they were the NATO alliance would not move further east beyond a United it's very important United Germany I think it was during the Oliver Stone interview it was questioned about that with Oliver Stone and Putin thought that he may email reports to go batches that you should get a signature and not only a neural premises and but and just after I told even if it'll be signed they didn't respect it but it just you know it just a formal question at least getting a signature and of course it didn't it didn't get it and and I'm sure exactly of the agreement you can sign with you with the us till no it hasn't just asked the Iranians agreement well the okay the US was not part of the Minsk agreements yeah nonetheless here monkey want to do segue to more about NATO yeah yeah I mean as a US military veteran of NATO operations Peter brought up the number of the increase in the number of NATO countries since the end of the Cold War you know 13 almost doubling the size of NATO but that hasn't in led to an increase in either NATO's military strength nor in its security for either itself or the world to the contrary it has led to greater insecurity for Europe Montenegro you know these other countries they haven't contributed to the safety of the people in NATO countries and there's a lot of challenges you know that we need to expand to protect Europe from Russia right and they don't that when Russia respondents that they feel threatened by NATO's expansion how could you be threatened by us it's a fact that NATO and its member states are the most aggressive military bloc on earth the number of interventions regime change military operations in the past 20 years or just over that since the end of the Soviet Union from Serbia to Iraq to Libya to Syria to Yemen today how could Russia not feel threatened by NATO they would be fools and if they didn't see this blatant illegal military aggression as a threat and their NATO is a figure to them - what's Washington that have been policy again the legitimization and problem is has gotten more and more dangerous we're closer to a conflict for more divisions in Eastern Europe NATO plus additional American troops more funding and the Russians respond of course and they send troops to their side of the border they got a nuclear capable of skander missiles and now we're in the Kaliningrad and now we're developing hypersonic weapons and where the u.s. is trying to make battlefield mini nukes more usable right we're financially no this is exponentially more dangerous it reduces reduces decision times it makes strategic conflict much more problematic and difficult to stop is even acceptable that's what's really scary even acceptable I think we're in a worse position than we ever were in the Cold War there is no a new border on the nuclear war as soon as you will talking about I personally opens new nuclear weapons in my opinion Putin did secend that Ronald Reagan did with the ideas in 1983 he started a new race but this time the the trap is for the US and it works actually if you look at on the US Senate I guess I already I have already noted two strong declarations like look at what the what what does Russia we have to do the same well you have the anti-ballistic missile treaty that the u.s. so walked away from one of the pillars of Arms Control and as we speak right now we have decision time with Iran again I was a very strong critic of Obama's foreign policy but I applauded him Britain this amazing move in because it's going against the trend of Newcomb fighting nuclear proliferation and it should be sent as an example okay I have to disagree with you Putin didn't start any new arms race the US China have all been developing you miss you miss mister you misunderstood me what I think is that Putin exactly know how it works in us that there is a such strong lobby for a military complex that if you just put some new card on the table all the systems will start to work and to run without any control as it works no because if you look at the difference in the defense the defense website the u.s. difference website newspapers any magazines and they are talking about how we are going to to get again the first place before Russia they want to buy no there is again 1 billion to develop some well I mean that but that's also a function of the military-industrial complex this time is Russia it's Putin who create the trap yes because they're doing it for starting we are going to build a new system of protection and so on that's right let the u.s. bankrupt themselves with you were talking about things that Obama did well the Iran treaty but Obama also supported the trillion dollar modernization program over the next 30 years of America's nuclear arsenal which we now estimate is gonna probably cause no Peace Prize right president perfume um to be fair the head of them the war committee has has since said I made a mistake with that no no kidding had any meaning right okay gentlemen how do we get out of this downwards spiral because it's a good to ask this question today on the anniversary of the the feat of fascism in Europe because the Soviet Union in the United States along with France along with Britain were allies and it was a world historic moment now look where we stand people how did we get out of this hole or we don't we have no international leader on a global scale who represents anything beyond his own country's national interest you're talking about the need to see the world for the eyes of your adversaries and nobody's really doing that Trump is incapable gee I'm not sure what he's more narrowly focused certainly Merkel is not doing that I quit all my interviews I keep pushing Putin to play that role but he hasn't done that yet but we need somebody to speak for humana will be called aggressive behavior I'm sorry I'm sorry they didn't okay and so but between the US and Russia there are three conflict areas now but we've got to find some way to sit down and talk and try to begin to resolve some you know find something we can work together on the problem with that and it's a discursive dilemma because if you sit down and talk that's appeasement okay that's what how it's been painted by the current political establishment even Trump accused moon jae-in of appeasement and why he wanted to talk to North Korea and moon told him to you know go eff himself and is now is now and may progress in terms of resolving it doesn't get resolved because of Trump's threats Syria as well if you when you look at non the non Western powers that are involved I mean what we could put Turkey Iran and Russia working towards peace you know that's something they don't recognize again this is seen as a as a as a strategy of appeasement and this is what I find most frustrating because we had more we had to matrix ceasefires in the works in Syria what power upended it it was the United States each time yeah since since you know the establishment of the neo neoliberal global capitalist system which has inevitably led to its own destruction by the trent of the west anyway if its originators by the slow transfer of wealth from the west to the east as the West declines in their relative share of global GDP and other countries rise to the fore until the US and its client states in the West give up on the idea of the unipolar world of us hegemony where they set the values and and and standards for the rest of the world I'm afraid there won't be any peace by that but that unipolar moment is over it just there's no no technicians not a recognition isn't recognition because the one who announced it was Charles Krauthammer and first he went from the unipolar moment and then in 2003 said it's the unipolar era is going to be unbounded then 2005 he says well the unipolar moment is over so so there there is a growing recognition Fukuyama has given up on the end of history but but all those books gentlemen the US government the US political and it must be said now the European politically I have Exceptionalist views that haven't given up on that until there is radical political change which I believe is structurally impossible foreign policy-wise in the United States then it is only the US is economic decline that will allow room for the real birth of a multipolar world I don't believe we need one global leader to lead the pack I think we need recognition that there are multiple multipolar centers of power and we need these world leaders recognizing their own limitations Russia recognizes certainly now that has limited American exceptionalism limitations exactly just in my opinion there is a reason for hope it's at the Russia it may be a bit optimistic because Russia is an open country we are tomorrow in the Cold War when we have in the West such an image of the Soviet Union that you know a great country with its own wet winter and that everybody lives under you know under the another suite so for instance in one month and in my opinion is that the reason why the West tried to get a boycott of this event will have I don't know of thousands Western supporters you see that there are bears roaming around the streets okay yeah obviously you're talking about the world it will be and it's not you know it's not intellectuals it's not intelligentsia US intelligence and it's no more people you know loving loving of local citizens and so that they will they will come to Russia I will talk to Russia they will see that everything who works not so bad in Russia actually that there is no agressivity at all from from the Russian population even with the US citizens that are here many thanks to my guests here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules okay now for the extended version of our program W were talking about the world's opinion of Russian what they might experience when they visit Moscow and other cities in Russia for the world cuts so we get two positive effects actually the first one is that the usual American citizen and with some citizen witty that Russian people are nominee it's like this all the songs of sting during the Cold War Russian love the okay and they are going to see that and the second points are going to understand that the media's lying always or when they are talking about Russia so in my opinion if there is a reason of hope I know Mark is going to false flag attacks can using chemical weapons I don't I'm not sure that we're not gonna see one before that but you're here with a group of students from the American University said twenty twenty students what are some of their impressions for the ones that have never been here before you know what the images of Russia and American media and and of Putin and of this country and its a tight dictatorship Putin controls everything that goes on here and that there's no freedom so what I wanted the students to do was speak with Russian students and professors and so we got a bunch of students together from Moscow State University who are all studying English and fluent and we had a very interesting discussion yesterday because the danger is we all know is that the Americans have one view the Russians have another view and as if we live in parallel universes and there's no intersection the narratives are completely different and that's what's so dangerous there's no common backgrounds for us even talking at this point so to sit down with Russian college students and then we had a session today with Alexei Pushkov the senator and who's very impressive and suddenly think again I wanted them to hear about how the world looks from the Russian perspective and they get a lot of that from my classes anyway because as you were saying we need leaders and others who can see the world through the eyes of our adversaries and that doesn't exist now at least I know it doesn't exist in the United States there are a few people but very few people you know interestingly with his recurring theme on this program usually Dmitri bah bitch is sitting where you are right now and he very often stresses Russia's patience yeah on how its treated on the international stage particularly by the West yeah but see it's not seen as a patience it's you know if Russia moves troops inside its own border you know then somehow that's aggressive okay Putin has ties to the Kremlin I mean the the quality the caliber of media coverage of Russia is simply appalling at times I mean it's ridiculous it's nonstop and and there's a single refrain that you hear from CNN MSNBC and it so it's not only that Russia intervened in the u.s. election but that was an act of war you have no historical context ever given in the US media so it was another Pearl Harbor that's what it was okay I mean ridiculousness and of course I'd like to stress with that I'm so tired of the Russia Russia Russia collusion dilution we don't even really talk about anymore but it it this is one of those key stories where is turn the media into where you it's it's it has no facts that you these stories no longer have to be fact base because if there's a simple assumption that of course somebody the Russians did this they they're aggressive I mean was at the former's a CIA director Brennan that said that the the Russians are genetically predisposed to be yes James Forrestal said back in 1945 well we've come a long way Peter yeah yeah alright well first coming back on Xavier alright you know you know that the glass is half empty half full I'm a realist the glass is is natural resources to secure for my country's interests now I don't have any hope all right we already had the Olympics and ordinary Westerners and people from around the world did get to come to see to Russia and and relations between Russia and the West have only plummeted downward since right in order for your premise to have any power that ordinary citizens could go back and say we're not aggressive bears you'd have to believe that there is actually the democratic potential in these countries to overturn their foreign policy and military establishments and I hate to tell you but that's simply not the truth right so no I don't have any hope in you know this when you have then you have an apocalyptic view yeah yeah I I hope to avoid the final apocalypse only when the relative military and economic economic way okay I can choose the point I can't judge about the US population because I'm not a specialist of the US civilization but I can tell you it could work with the French supporters with the German supporters because there is even in Germany there is a natural empathy for Russian people and for Russia my visits to Europe tell me exactly the same thing I mean sanctions there are many people that complain how sanctions hurt their home there why are we sanctioning Russia hurting our economy to make the Americans happy okay because it doesn't affect them don't forget that the French parliament it was two or three years ago vote against the sanctions against Russia the vote against along the as usual didn't respect the the Parliament vote against French sanctions are still there yes four years later but you know other countries there is some you can deny there is some politics positive step steps in in Europe any I'm sorry but if there is only u.s. sanctions against Russia if Europe is again this sanction its order because the bother get its chance today yeah if Trump imposes new sanctions at Iran with opening what is your gonna do you know I mean they've got a choice because Trump is probably going to say that anybody who deals with Iran there's going to face sanctions from the United States and other Europeans going to give in to that or are they going to stand up okay we we know that there's no love for Trump in Europe there's no love for Trump anywhere I do a speaking tour in India in January eighth college a small colleges some places where I was the first foreigner they'd ever seen and I mentioned Trump's name and the kids start laughing the same thing when I was in Singapore the same thing with the vibe with the Russian students we met with yesterday so there is a sense of Trump as a pariah unless he's in Riyadh and in Tel Aviv okay in a few other places this is the u.s. foreign policy and military establishment this is across party lines you don't hear a lot of Democrats loudly calling for peace with Iran or Russia but you are gonna hear a lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans saying don't tear up the nuclear deal only if only because Democrats are trying to defend Obama's leg but they are willing to buck the Israel AIPAC and Israel and Netanyahu on this Netanyahu's gonna be here tomorrow many things depend of day money because if you look at inside the the the European Union the chief is Germany and the north dream case not stream to case is very interesting because it's a it's vital forward for Germany they can't continue having such an industry they have without the Russian God through North Rim too if you look at the last US sanctions it doesn't concern now swim to so it means that when there is so highly strategic problem for Europe I mean for Germany I am NOT going to tell you it's a farce right but what we'll do Angela Merkel will be very important because anyway we see Marco will follow and get a mecha okay rapidly running off time Peter we had Vladimir Putin just re inaugurated again for a six-year term presumably his last one it's a whole cottage industry in the West particularly in the UK in the United States to demonize Vladimir Putin so are these cottage industries happy because they have material for at least next six years even I've often thought you know on New Year's all these people should send a bottle of champagne to the Russian president because he he actually generates a livelihood for these people for these industries okay it's very secure industry you can take that to the bank okay but on a more serious note here that because they have these kind of cottage industries media likes it Rachel Maddow over at MSNBC makes a career out of it that doesn't give me much hope that anything much is going to change because for them it's Putin is the problem not Russia defending its national interests that's why I call on Putin all the time to change the narrative do something that's going to surprise them do something when they were places in the world where Russia could take more initiative and then begin to change that narrative now Putin and Trump are talking about having a meeting or something and and that would be a good thing we need to get leaders talking we need to begin solving some real problems the nuclear issue is one place now Trump immediately said that he doesn't want to extend the New START treaty even though food that's indicated he'd like to so that's probably not gonna happen the sanctions I would love to see the United States lift the sanctions it will never I would never lift those saying how was it jackson-vanik last yeah happen right away but that we need to step back from the brink because most people see that situation but he does want to step back from the brink except for the Washington Foreign Policy blob okay I see that inclination a exists in Europe certainly exist here certainly in the Middle East we've seen other times when we've gone to the brink and then we tried to step back well Kennedy did in 1962 Kennedy take a look at Kennedy for the 1962-63 like a cruise shop at the same time it is possible even with the military-industrial complex even with the economic interest involved to have a moment of sanity what happened to John Kennedy yeah it's the question of figures before the sanction the part of the trading between the US and Russia it was something like all point imports a miniscule okay with your Union it it's for Russians maybe for 45% I don't remember and actually after the sanction the the trade between Russia and the US I think we run out of time here my Peter brought up his last point gives me a little bit of hope but I'd probably tend to side with mark I said for our extended version of our program I hope you enjoyed it remember across stock rolls and we'll see you next time
