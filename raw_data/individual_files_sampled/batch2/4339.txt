dr. salts thank you for being on with us Stephanie talked a little bit about the outpouring of love and support for Anthony Bourdain's family one of those tweets comes from Bryan Cranston who says when it comes to board a and indicates paid it illustrates that success is not immune to depression we all need to be more aware of our friends who are suffering so what can people do what are the warning signs and what should people do if they think their loved one might be struggling well actually if they think their loved one is struggling they should absolutely ask they should ask when they're suffering whether they feel blue how blue but really when it comes to suicide if you have any inkling you really need to ask directly I think it's a myth that people often believe all I shouldn't say anything about suicide because I might suggest it and that is simply untrue you should ask someone if they have thoughts of harming themselves if they say yes then you should ask them if they have a means or a plan of harming themselves if they say yes which often they do you should take away the means in the moment you should stay with them and be with them and if maybe take them to an emergency room you can absolutely save a life there are various hallmark red flags let's say in terms of suicide if someone is increasingly isolating themselves feeling intense pain in the form of hopelessness and helplessness and worthlessness something that causes shame is often a spark for a suicide as you brought up unfortunately copycats do happen and so I think particularly in the wake of this week where two people who people often think oh they have it all commit suicide you have to be concerned about people in general because numbers have gone up dramatically in the last couple of years and this is really a national crisis at this point it's more deaths than people died in car accidents in the opioid epidemic so we have to be attuned to the fact that if you're suffering depression there is a real possibility and you need to seek treatment and unfortunately stigma keeps many people from seeking treatment for themselves or even encouraging their loved one to get care bottom line we got to talk about it we've got to talk to each other dr.
