you don't have a written agreement with your player so a player literally can fire you at will and then you are done you're out of work so it's an extremely volatile job that's out there a lot of people can also Glamour's and it's really not i caddied on the pga tour for 10 years on and off it's the way that I got into ketene was totally by accident I was doing stand-up comedy and started hanging out where the tour was and doing shows when the tour was gonna be in the town so I could perform one of guys that I got to be good friends with Robert Gamez called me one day and said I'm not having fun on the golf course will you carry for me so I did and I fell in love with caddy and so then I wanted to keep doing it but how it works payment wise is you get a weekly paycheck as a caddy your paycheck is tied to the performance of your player a lot of times bonuses are built-in so once we hit the million dollar mark and your weekly salary can go up or your percentage will go up or sometimes both that's one of the things that the general public is really confused about they think that number one caddies that the player pays for everything and that caddy just make 10 percent of what a fitted it's not like that even a little bit daddies pay all their own expenses airfare hotel rental car food like they got to pay their own way there was a big lawsuit between the caddies and the PGA Tour because players have a retirement fund and they have like even health insurance and whatnot it's not that way for caddies on the PGA Tour if you look at it like baseball how it works is the South American tour and the Canadian tour that would be like single a ball and the European Tour that would be like maybe double a ball and the LPGA Tour it would be like double A then the web.com Tour that's like Triple A and then you get to the Big Dance which is the PGA Tour so basically just follow the money the hardest part in the part that I love the most is the mental aspect you every golfer out here the best ones in the world they all talk about my team because it's such a team effort there's so much more pressure on caddies to know what to say and when to say it and sometimes when not to say anything and that's always been the hardest thing about caddy and then doing all those other jobs as well keeping the club's clean making sure your players hydrated and has enough energy and eating the right foods and getting up early knowing what the forecast is but gives all those little subtle things that makes caddying really hard but then it's also what makes it so rewarding you know you don't just talk golf with the player you talk about plenty of other stuff when you're out there and you want to be on the golf course with someone who enjoys your company and who you enjoy being around as well because you're gonna be with them for so long you get to be so involved and that's also why like when caddies and players spray it's like it's like ending a marriage I'm a horrible golfer I'm Terry yeah but I can understand how to work my way with a pro around the golf course like if a caddies great at playing golf so what I'm I'm never gonna get to hit the shot for the pro they still have to hit the shot no matter what I have to be good at getting them to hit their best shot
