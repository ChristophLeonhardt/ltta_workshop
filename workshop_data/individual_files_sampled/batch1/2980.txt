running is super high in tech support and there's a lot of like body weight with every step that you that you take it increases by about seven times your body weight on with every step that you take when you're running you can develop heel spurs that plantar fasciitis that just means that there is inflammation at the bottom of the foot tendonitis stress fractures knee pain hip pain back pain the list goes on and on I think fractures are the worst thing because it really takes a long time to heal so a lot of tendon issues and plantar fasciitis those can be you know a couple weeks but once you fracture your foot you're talking six to eight weeks of no running and this leads to a lot of tears in my office people cry and you know they're training for the marathon they love it this is such a stress reliever and all of a sudden it's like you come to a screeching halt I'm out no running for two months so I think that's probably one of the worst things that can happen because you really have to be off your feet and in a cast or animu and physical therapy sometimes even surgery you can break your toe bones or your foot bones or your ankle bones so bad that they need to be reset surgically and that's even longer of a recovery make sure that your sneakers are in good shape do not wear shoes that are old and worn out or that you borrowed from your sister or that you let are the garage sale or that you've had in your closet for three years like they need to be specifically running shoes and it has to be real in really good shape do not wear those shoes out and about so if you want to be serious about your running you really need to have a running pair of sneakers that are dedicated just for running so if you don't have the shoes that are giving you the shocks the shock absorption the cushioning the arch support that you need it can affect your whole entire skeleton it doesn't just stop at your feet so it goes all the way up
