Democrats are locked and loaded and prepared to use any and all scare tactics to block the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I'm gonna tell you about that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel as you all surely know by now on Monday president Trump announced his nomination to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the left is cued up to use any and all issues to block it hint they're not going to be able to literally any and all issues it doesn't matter who the nominee is not even a little bit know how I know because they sent out a pre drafted response to the nominee without filling in the actual name the screeching hyenas behind the women's March sent out a statement that provided these well-thought-out musings in response to Donald Trump's nomination of xx to the Supreme Court get your crap together ladies although to their credit the people who support them and subsequently donate to their cause probably don't care who the nominee is they just know that they have to hashtag resist now while Democrats efforts are futile Kavanagh will be confirmed the left is using the topic of Obamacare specifically reproductive rights to scare the American people and read reps in blue states into joining them in their obstruction in a statement Sobhan Chuck Schumer said this regarding Brett Cavanaugh's nomination in selecting judge Brett Kavanaugh for the supreme court president Trump has put reproductive rights and freedoms and health care protections for millions of Americans on the judicial chopping block his own writings make clear that he would rule against reproductive rights and freedoms and that he would welcome challenges to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act if Americans believe in a woman's right to make her own reproductive choices and that health insurance companies shouldn't be able to charge people more based on pre-existing conditions now is the time to fight I'm calling on all Americans from all walks of life to make their voices heard from now until the end of this battle so classic scare tactic right although he clearly isn't taking into account the fact that many people myself included do not think that Obama care was constitutional to begin with and a lot of people like me don't think that employers should be forced to provide birth control and abortions to their employees now Democrats of course are still going to try to block Kavanagh nomination citing the McConnell maneuver but lest we forget and it's actually Joe Biden's principle from 1992 when he said that a nomination would not be brought forth also this is a midterm election not a presidential election also Obama pushed through Elena Kagan and hello Harry Reid sir thank you so much for reducing number of votes back in 2013 to 51 to push through Obama nominees so now the nuclear option is going to bite them in the butt that's the thing about changing voting rules in Congress you're not always going to be in power so you better make sure that you are changing things for the better of everyone and not just your party so what do you think does this scare tactic work on you are you worried that oh my gosh if Cavanaugh is confirmed we're all going to lose our health insurance we're all gonna get super all gonna die yeah no it's not working on me either and I feel like anyone with half a brain is going to see straight through this to the core of the situation which is that as an appellate court judge and the second highest court in the land with over 300 opinions to show for his career that he is yet another remarkably and supremely qualified pick for the Supreme Court Democrats just don't like it because they were living on easy street for a while and now the adults are back in power elections have consequences folks maybe next time don't put forth such a terrible candidate screwing over a poor old socialist in the process thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at WWWE need four words left shows make sure you're following us on Facebook and Twitter for all of our latest news and download our awesome new app for the rebel on the app store that way you will have instant and easy access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda headboard the rebel
