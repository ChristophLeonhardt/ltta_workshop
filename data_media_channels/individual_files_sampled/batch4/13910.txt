a tragic story today out of Anaheim Donald Duck is dead the much beloved Disney character was found in a motel 6 this morning law enforcement officials say he committed suicide by shooting himself four times in the back of the head from across the room the duck had recently been implicated in a political scandal after a project Veritas video was released showing Hillary Clinton operatives conspiring to disrupt Donald Trump events by sending Donald Duck to stand outside amidst the crowd as a symbol that Trump was ducking the release of his tax returns in a somber press conference longtime duck friend Mickey Mouse told reporters quote Donald spoke to me about the scandal and I should have known he was depressed but I couldn't understand what he was saying because of that stupid duck voice of his he did tell me he was deeply ashamed of being involved in Clinton's political dirty tricks and they only agreed to do it to pay off a gambling debt at least that's what I think he said mostly it just sounds like quack quack quack quack quack unquote FBI director James Comey who led the investigation into Donald's debt said he saw no evidence of criminality remarking quote we have made a very thorough investigation using the same team who investigated Hillary Clinton's email scandal we've concluded that mr. duck committed suicide after receiving a visit in his motel room from construction contractor Vinny the trigger Sabbath Tony mr. Sabatini however had an alibi he proved he was doing contracting work for Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe by showing us a ten thousand dollar check which McAuliffe had personally signed unquote according to a recent story in The Wall Street Journal Governor McAuliffe a longtime Clinton ally had recently engineered a massive contribution to the state Senate campaign of the wife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe this did not affect the investigation however as Mr McCabe says he has fully investigated himself and found himself innocent of any wrongdoing mr. duck Steerforth widow Daisy asked the press to respect her privacy but sources close to the case said that the bereaved mrs. duck was convinced that her husband had become depressed and committed suicide or if she wasn't convinced she would be or if she wouldn't be she might become depressed herself then who could tell what would happen to her not to mention Huey Dewey and Louie whose place of residence is known to the Clint campaign which had nothing to do with this incident police say a suicide note was left at the scene in which Donald Duck bequeathed his sailor suit to the United States Navy to be worn by any tiny sailor who didn't mind going naked from the waist down mr. duck further instructed that his body should be placed on a wood fire and served with the point Oh light orange glaze on a bed of Spanish rice trigger warning I've enjoyed Clavin and this is the Andrew clay ah man at least somebody's having a good time I knew you know I got stuck in traffic I was gonna tweet before I came in and take bets on through the monologue but I didn't have time all right look at least somebody's having a good time right at least we're happy here on the little island the little island of Clavin the little island of lost toys and it's mailbag day we got a very very intense mailbag which you folks on Facebook and YouTube won't be able to watch because it comes after the break but if you subscribe not only could you watch it not only could you watch it for a lousy eight bucks a month but but you could actually send questions in and then your life wouldn't be the mess it is okay because we'll answer your questions and then everything will be better so let's start off with some good news while we're in a good mood according to a poll conducted by Chapman University 42% of Americans are afraid of clowns whereas only 32% or afraid of climate change so this speaks well of the American people because there are evil clowns or climate change is not all right you know I left off yesterday I mean I mean it's not that the show is evolving into chaos or anything but I did make a mistake by not sending in this this piece of video I wanted to show you and this is a an organization that is called modern statesman org and they're you know they're pumping plugging several Republican candidates and they went to my pals at Madison McQueen to come up with a sort of thematic video I'm gonna play the whole video it's under two minutes long but this just shows you how the write should be communicating Madison McQueen is at the cutting edge of communication with on a campaign communication they did some of Ted Cruz's spots so that were some of the most watched spots during the primaries I just think this is really good stuff so take a look this is what I wanted to show you yesterday do you remember that idea we called America you poll tested by pundits and it's not very drawn abide tenured professors it was founded by statesmen and visionaries it was a revolution they let the Whigs foyer these guys were tough guys they didn't create safe spaces they challenged a superpower they didn't cut off debate they welcomed free speech free association and they change the course of history that's what they did when they created the United States of America because of their sacrifice you can pursue life liberty and your own happiness so stop tweeting about pumpkin spice lattes think about the big ideas that make us want like equality under the law and don't believe the high for the New York Times our best days are ahead if we live up to our principles and our potential we know it's not the government that makes us great only we the people have the power to do that sure we've got problems who doesn't that's why it's time to put on your big-boy pants and get into the arena it's time to be a better citizen you have the power to put an end to this rotten economy and then anxiety you're feeling it doesn't have to be that way so suck it up you're an American grab a steak a beer and some fireworks let's celebrate then let's take that energy let's take those principles let's recognize leaders who will make the changes we deserve sure there's a little insanity out there but there's also common sense and it's more important than ever and when you're in the arena we'll have one more voice for statesmanship for principals and for common sense no matter what happens good stuff good stuff my favorite my favorite moment is George Washington riding a shark and shooting a cannon that's really good good stuff and you know the reason I bring it up and the reason I keep bringing it up is because this is such a negative cycle and negative ads are working they are used because they work but on our side on our side on the side of the right the the left knows how to speak the language of vision they know how to speak the language of vision even Hillary Clinton who is the worst at it still doesn't where as Donald Trump really doesn't outside of his outside of his hat you know make America great again that that's that's the start that is a good start but this is stuff that really I think is going to appeal to this new generation of people who are basically libertarians who want to be left alone and who are under the gun and all these universities who are cutting off free speech and everything it's also I have to say kind of a signal that the Trump campaign is in serious trouble I mean you know people are still saying and this is true that the polls could all be wrong but the campaigns are acting as if the polls are right the campaigns are acting as if Trump is in trouble for instance you know Hillary is now moving into states that you would have thought would have been out outside of her you know powers to grab including like Texas which is insane and you know there's a chance that the Democrats could take back the Senate big disaster and Trump is like you know he's no longer holding fundraisers anymore the Trump campaign says they were planning to stop fund raisers but other people are saying he's punishing the GOP establishment because he thinks now he's lost well to hell with them and all this so it's it really is it really is a moment of division on on the right that is not happening on the left because they have kept their machine together and a foot propped up this horrible desiccated empty corrupt candidate somehow they've all managed to get behind her in ways that we haven't managed to get behind our corrupt investigated a candidate all right so let's take a look because this is kind of symbolic of this big dust-up between megyn kelly and Newt Gingrich so they're talking about you know Gingrich is clearly just at the edge end of his you know he's just had it and Megan is saying look this is this is partly at least Trump's fault because no matter how corrupt Hillary is Trump has gotten in his own way this is the first clip let's assume she is corrupt right she's just as corrupt three weeks ago and three months ago and she she would have been corrupt and collapsing physically on September 11th of this year and her poll numbers tanked but then you know what happened he had a rough first debate he took the bait on Alicia Machado he stayed in that trap for a week the Access Hollywood tape came out which was not produced by Hillary Clinton that was trump with governor pence I get it I know where you're coming from let me point out something to you sure the three major networks spent 23 minutes attacking Donald Trump that night and 57 seconds on Hillary Clinton's secret speeches you don't think this is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda news vest yeah I mean you want to know why Donald Trump said a roast is a sexual predator that is people like you using language that's inflammatory that's not true excuse me mr. Zanger whether it's true or not what we know is that there are leads to you that's right I'm not taking a position on it oh yes you are when you use the words you took a position that is exactly the bias people are upset by now the interesting thing about this is obviously the Trump supporters don't like megan kelly she's kind of they feel like she's been after Trump for the the way he treats women but the interesting thing about this is both of them have a point you know and and what what megyn kelly starts out by saying that Trump has largely shot himself in the foot you know as I keep saying he put his foot in his mouth and then shot himself in the foot which is really dangerous you know don't try that at home that's all true that is all true I mean this is the way he brought this he didn't let his he didn't let his own campaign do any Oppo research you know you do Oppo research on yourself to find out what's going to come out he wouldn't let them do it cuz he knows this stuff is around he knows what's around he knows who he is okay on the other hand she because she goes into totally phony journalism mode when he hits her on that sexual predator thing cuz he is absolutely right you can't say did you still beat your wife and you go what do you mean I'm just asking I don't know I don't know but you know she says herself I don't know if it's true if you don't know it's true that's not the way to ask that question you do not use the term sexual predator if you don't know but it's true I mean that it's absurd and the media has been doing this forever forever you know we're just asking we're just bringing it up we're just letting these we're just airing that you know they're we're airing these women's grievances if you haven't checked out that story you know anybody can come up and say that a guy did something to her you know anybody can say that you have to get you have to really know that this is good stuff before you start airing it now that standard is gone from journalism but Megan shouldn't defend it megyn kelly shouldn't defend it so let's listen to the next the next round they go on and this is here megyn kelly does something that really drives me nuts let's I think that your defensive nasaan this may speak volumes sir let me make my point and that will give you the floor what I said is if Trump is a sexual predator then it's a big story and what we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will that's what we saw then we saw ten women come forward after he denied actually doing it at a debate to say that was untrue he did it to me he did it to me we saw reporters we saw the people who had worked with him people from Apprentice and so on and so forth he denies it all which is his right we don't know what the truth is my point to you is as a media as a media story we don't get to say the ten women are lying we have to cover that story sir sure okay so so it's worth twenty three minutes of the three networks to cover that story and Hillary Clinton in a secret speech in Brazil to a bank the page that 225,000 saying her dream is an open border where 600 million people could come to America that's not worth covering doing tapes of your show recently you are fascinated with sex and you don't care about public policy that's what I get out of watching you tonight you know two things that Kelly does here they're really wrong I mean first of all accusing somebody of being defensive after you've attacked them is absurd you know I always love that I throw a punch at you and you know you block the punch don't be defensive it's like of course he's defensive she's attacking him you know but the other thing is this thing she does at the end and she does it all the time it's cute Megan this cute Megan stuff I mean megan kelly has got a very very big line in a women or picked on and women's you said this and you shouldn't say this about women and women have it so hard in the news industry which is kind of absurd and then she pulls this like cute routine and she does it at the debates when she's making points you know that it's just not on it is just not on I find it incredibly off-putting and I think she's a smart decent commentator she's not a reporter but I think she's a smart decent commentator but but she really has no right to do this and what he is exploding about what he is exploding about is this concentration on sex rather than on substance and he has a point now look we know that's what the media are and the problem is the problem with it is is that it really only goes one way and that's the thing he makes in this last clip that's the point he makes in this last clip you know what mr. speaker I'm not fascinated by sex but I am fascinated by the protection of women and understanding what we're getting in the Oval Office and I think the American voters would like to call we're gonna send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing because after all you are worried about sexual predators yeah listen it's not about me it's about the women and men of America and the poll numbers show us that the women of America in particular are very concerned about these allegations and in large part believe that they are a real issue and one of Thomas Newcomen summarily do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator we on the Kelly file have covered that story as well sir I will use the words I want to hear your words Bill Clinton's sexual predator idea say Bill Clinton's sexual predator mr. speaker this table are the disbarred by the bar eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar penalty excuse me sir we on the Kelly file have covered the Clinton matter as well we've hosted Kathleen Willey we covered the examples of him being accused as well but he's not on the ticket and the polls also show that the American public is this interested in the deeds of Hillary Clinton's husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president Donald Trump amazing stuff that's it's amazing in exchange because she look megyn kelly works for a news entity in a news entity that basically supports Donald Trump she is not in the Trump tank but it basically supports Donald Trump and it has an excellent new show and the Bret Baier hour and it has an excellent commentary show on the Chris Wallace show on Sunday but a lot of the rest of it is noise and a story about sex is going to take the take the take precedence over stories of substance but this thing just should just highlights this interchange is highlights what a weird weird election I got to stop and say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over because this really does get weird
