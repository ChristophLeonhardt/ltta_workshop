well the focus of the inquiry is on what caused and what spread the fire that took place almost a year ago now and it took the lives of 72 people and one of the most moving accounts that we heard from the public testimonies that were taking place here today was that of a man who lived on the 21st floor of Grenfell tower and at the time of the blaze his wife was seven months pregnant take a listen to his heart wrenching account of what happened so I held my son Amnon Zeidan hoping it was all battery wishing praying for any kind of miracle that he would just open his eyes move make a sound my wife she's made of the hardest material I know I'm on fire I extreme encourage hold not be here some of the relatives of the victims of this fire haven't been given the visas to come here in time for the beginning of what's taking place here one Moroccan man named Kareem Khalifa who lost his sister in the fire he applied for a visa to come to the inquiry in December but he said he was crushed after having to wait four months for it to be processed and he wasn't sure whether he'd be able to attend this very important inquiry at all now the home office have said that the visa had been issued on Wednesday and that all visa applications are looked in and a on a case-by-case basis so he is finally getting his visa but by the time that he arrives it'll be at least three days in to the inquiry and the opposition Labour Party says that's not good enough and that the government is continuing to fail the victims of the grenfell tragedy the Grantville families had to lobby hard even to get a partial panel although tourism a said she would leave no stone unturned in this inquiry she also promised victims would not suffer irrespective of their immigration status but is now failing the family's once more so the scandal surrounding the fire hasn't died down at all and the burnt out shell of the building is still standing in the middle of the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea it's become a bit of a symbol of government failures and of housing inequality and of social injustice and there is still big questions surrounding whether ultimately someone needs to go to prison but the inquiry here aims to answer those questions it's going to take a while though public inquiries are by their nature very slow-moving beasts and this one is no exception it's expected to last until 2020 or maybe even beyond that
