now let's talk about Egypt because they are a different proposition aren't they josée how differently do you think the team will have to set up against Egypt compared to how they set up against Saudi Arabia Egypt as I don't want to say the fastest but I have to say one of the fastest players in the world with ball without wall you can dribble you can attack spaces behind defenders I think Russia they have to drop the block back and they have to react better when they lose the ball because as Peter was saying they can sit a little bit against a very naive team against the team without any physical power and Egypt can can hurt them so I think they have to to think maybe it looks a contradiction but I have to say this I don't think Russia can score many goals and I'm saying these after five nil but I don't think they can score many goals against good teams so I think they cannot concede many goals - if they want to get results and for me that the game against Egypt is the crucial match of the group if not they have to go to the last match against Uruguay in the searching of points Peter was saying they need to improve on defense how much can you improve in five days what can you do on a training field - sure things up you know I am the manager is is he will be until he dies a goalkeeper and probably we have different different different views of it I think it's difficult to do it in the next five days by the coaching point of view is difficult to do it in the next five days but I think with a big strong goalkeeper personality demanding more from the players in that moment there I think an improve a lot that's why I'm always looking to leadership on the pitch because I don't think I can only play play outside but the game is inside and inside I think they have even to to improve the concentration levels because against a very short team because from my perspective I think that Saudi Arabia players there were really small compared to the Russians they had the ball in the few set pieces they had they want balls in in in the earth so I think they have to improve specially on that leadership on that concentration on that fear to consider goals because specially the teams that cannot score many goals they have to be very solid by the defensive point of view and again is a contradiction but I don't believe that Russia can score many goals there are things that you can do I mean I agree with with with the goalkeeper part that we need a strong goalkeeper that can and we talked about that before and I think we that kid fear he's been so heavily criticized for many things that he is not really responsible for you know you have a good goalkeeper needs to be he needs to be protected and and it is no secret that Russia are suffering from a lot of injuries from their normal defenders so he spent you know the managers been sort of checking players in an hour and he's taking you know all the players already retired back in and but what this is gonna do this is clean sheet is actually gonna give him a little bit of confidence that we can keep clean sheets even though it's against Saudi Arabia you know you always even though you win five nil and you play against an easy team you always take the positives out and you tell yourself that was brilliant and you bring it into the next game I really agree with you on the set pieces I think they were very very disorganized and not very convincing and when you play against teams that are smaller in sizes you have to be much better than that you have to be convincing in every poll that you have it's gonna clear so everybody knows we're dealing with that if there's a little bit of insecurity then everybody will feel that insecurity and I think working on set pieces will go a long way to improve the team and improve that offending because once they have that little bit of confidence what we defended that well we could defend this then they take it up - into open play as well and you know the midfield players I thought they did really well but they have to do more defensively as well but it's difficult to judge it completely on the game today I have to say that certainly is okay and finally before we let you guys go I know it's pretty late josée a prediction then perhaps Russia against Egypt if you got a score in mind or I think will be a draw I go if I could if I had to choose one of the three results I'll go for I'll go for a draw can I just ask what have you projected from this group yeah I was predicting Uruguay to win it and Russia to finish we want and I would go forest to finish second with four points yeah yeah Russia and Egypt with four points and Muslim and goalscorer and hopefully Saudi will not lose okay by 6:00
