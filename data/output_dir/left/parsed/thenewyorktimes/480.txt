Hi, I'm Melissa Chiu director of
the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden in Washington.
We're standing here in
Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror
Room.
It's called Phalli's Field and
it was created in 1965.
It was the very first
Infinity Mirror room.
Each of the Infinity Mirror
rooms in the exhibition
differs.
The common thread is that
you, standing inside
this very intimate space,
feel as if there are infinite 
views of yourself,
but also the other elements.
And they could be light,
illuminated pumpkins
or even lanterns.
One of the works is just
a very simple strings of light.
which create this sense of you
being alone in the cosmos.
