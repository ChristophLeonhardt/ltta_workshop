hi Anthony okay and join the stream today a new bollywood film has people talking about the cast and the songs but most importantly about the message the importance of mental health and hygiene by bringing the story of one Indian innovator to the big screen the film's producer director and cast hope they are removing stigma around periods not all superheroes wear capes this is Padma Americo give us Superman hair back - spider-man back looking India keep out Batman do thinking I'm mad but not only become a big man strongman not making country strong rebuilding say hi woman strong mother strong sister strong then country strong the myths and taboos around menstruation are a monthly often painful part of life and adding to that burden lack of access to sanitary pads as a result girls miss or drop out of school stunting economic opportunities down the line and further reinforcing those taboos but one man Aruna Chalam Murugan atham became well known for his low cost sanitary pad making machine of creating awareness about the unhygenic practices around menstruation in India he is in his own words explaining why he got started it's always happened on my early meetings so they impressed my new I what I do I used to offer a small small gift so like that one day I saw she is carrying something behind her the purpose is to hide me something then I asked what is he she replied instantly like slapping on my cheek which is none of your business then I saw that she is playing very seriously I ran away behind her to see what is she is hiding on particular day I saw a nasty rat clock with few blood stain here and there on the cloth then I understand she is adopting my imagine mother to manage her period A's this remarkable story is the inspiration for the new film pad man joining us now from al-jazeera studios in London we have Twinkle Khanna producer of pad man via Skype from Colorado in the United States zubeida by founder and CEO of eyes that's a company that designs low-cost health and hygiene products for girls and women remember India JD Mandel founder of akka innovations that's a social enterprise that enables poor women to produce and distribute affordable eco-friendly sanitary napkins guests welcome I just want to pause for a moment and say this phrase the world's first feature film about menstrual hygiene so Bader JD when you first saw that this was happening your initial reaction was what I think for me was well this is a great conversation starter and I'd like at least for me that came from the space of maternal health trying to kind of figure out how am I in my lifetime we're gonna educate these women about importance of hygiene because there are women dying every two minutes and childbirth just because they can't ask or perceive what hygiene or cleanliness is and this was really exciting for us to know that there is going to be a large scale conversation starter that might help our work going forward all right and JD conversation starter for you what were you thinking you saw the posters Padma coming 2018 and you thought what actually our story started with him only back in 2010 when we started the first even in 2000 in the northern part of India so and I have been knowing him for almost 10 years now and as I said like so I knew nothing about menstruation before we started the unit I was trying to commercialize some of the graphs of innovation documented by an aspirin innovation foundation in honey bee Network whom I am associated with for 15 years so one of the innovation is trying to commercialize was his innovation in mccracken and the foothills with a collaborative honeybee netbook so so and then we moved on and made our machines we made some possible paths but I think like when this is coming up I felt as a great lead to this topic to be talking about when we started work sadly in organisations apart from him who was talking about this so now with this movie I think there's a body I'm thinking about this I have a question for you twinkle from Twitter I am per owner says I would like to ask twinkle about the thought process she went through when she decided to make a movie on the topic which is considered a taboo in India she's the producer of pulling a lot of money into the movie was she apprehensive of the movies commercial success twinkle right in the beginning I'd like to say that if I was really making a movie for commercial success or that sort of movie I would have to blow up 11 cars in the first theme and then I'd be guaranteed a box-office hit making a movie about menstruation was really for me not about commercial success as much yes we do want the movie to do well because if we make profits than other movies with a strong message would have the courage to go ahead but it was just Morgan Anthon story that I found compelling when I first read it I was doing some research for a column on menstruation and I read about him and it just gripped me because here was a man from a very conservative conservative village who encountered a problem when he realized that his wife was using rags and unlike other people he didn't think that I need to earn more money and then buy her sanitary pads he said I'm going to make her a low-cost sanitary pad and I thought that was fascinating the other thing that I found very appealing in his story was the fact that he at this point of time only sells his machines to NGOs and women's groups and enables them to earn a livelihood as well as giving them access to local sanitary pads when I saw his talks the thing that really appeals to me to make a movie about him is that there's a certain whimsy about him here's a man who's doing a very serious thing but he doesn't take himself as seriously which lends very well to a cinematic narrative and and so here we are with badminton let me just show you a clip of Murugan atham and he's talking about why it was so important for him to do the work he does it's not about money it's about the work this is a quick have a look competing Giants even from Harvard as far as difficult I make a rule woman to compete multinationals I'm Sicilian seventh year holidays six hundred interest what is my vision is I am going to make India as a under person sent in a producing country in my lifetime in this way I'm going to provide a lot less than a million door employment that I'm going to create that's what I'm not running after this bloody money I'm doing something serious Trinko he was on the set with you here he is with the star playing him also your husband Akshay Kumar and you and Morgan atham on the set what did he make of his story being made into such a huge film again I don't think he was really bothered about you know fame or money for that matter he was very interested in the movie that the protagonist and Akshay who plays him has the right posture of a welder so he was sort of obsessed with that no matter what we were doing he was like no but a welder doesn't stand like that and I said well they're only you know a handful of welders would really know that you don't hunch over in that manner I think for him it's a culmination of his life's work and he can see that and I kept telling him that Mugen now you're immortal your work is immortal and that sort of pleased him I guess let me show you a quote from the director our Balki and he says this is it's a children's film it must be seen with families we don't want to teach or preach our film is pure entertainment debater do you think that's gonna work the idea of we're not gonna do you we're not gonna do a lecture we're not doing a documentary we're going to have fun with this you know I think it's it's a wait and watch kind of thing I really want to see if that happens and I'd be very happy if that happens given the fact that there is so much like I was talking to my adviser the other day it's not necessarily about the taboo it's about the lack of a conversation and if this film can actually get people to sit together in front of the screen and watch this subject and talk about it I think that some that's would be kind of the victory of this in the menstrual hygiene space and there's so very few people working in the space Jeff and I are good friends as well I think it's just about how can we get these people to talk about it right and if it really happens nobody more excited than us I guess I'm speaking for Jesse physically there's a beautiful love song in this film which is already a hit song it's called a day city and it means that you're always going to go on together today onwards it's a love song between the two main characters have a listen have a look Oh Oh Eddie crushing up a sermon oh man up in the quarter Jody this idea that periods are shameful is something that is central to the film to the story of Murugan atham he says here on Twitter periods are not shameful our attitudes towards it are we have initiated the conversation it's time for you to initiate it around you you try and teach men and women about periods what they are how do you even start that conversation the very first thing as we believe like when we start conversation we try to talk about the science what we do not do the touch the meets and taboos directly but in India all this heats and taboos are somehow connected either with the religion or the culture and if you talk to the girls and the woman around that it would create a barrier so what we do instead to talk about the science you knew previous you also talk about that what is the science behind the situation what actually happens in 28-day cycle hardly women and girls in villages as well as in cities no or that so what we also talked about with the men like for having kids is very important for men but they do not know there's a connection between inspiration and childbirth if a woman is not menstruating they cannot have kids so once we make this connections like menstruation and birth is connected it makes it very simple for the men also to work on this and then they support the women actually support in terms of like financial support to buy any products or even support in terms of doing a household in the five days so the simple connections makes a lot of sense so we do it and then we feel like the who is talking is very important someone like who is close to them or someone whom they can trust could be a teacher in schools it could be the parents it could be the community woman whom they are interacting day to day basis they are the one who's to communicate we never talk like from our team and ego will you see ot program training of trainers we generally avoid talking to the girls and women directly because we feel like disconnects is very important and through that we make a lot of difference sure the beta does it resonate with you I know that you have a product which is affordable menstrual pads for for people very low incomes and can get it right here when you share this and you show this to people tell us the reaction because I think that's very telling sure I think for us the pads were created with a request from the woman that we were serving who were giving birth to babies and we have another pad that's called a postpartum hygiene pad which is very different because what you absorb postpartum is not menstrual blood and when women started using our pads for 48 hours childbirth they were like well do you have sanitary pads for us to start you know using regularly after that because we love your product and our product was created with women with the needs they had and with Gynaecologists and their kami I mean like their chlorine-free and DC that satisfaction coming from us and for us the core of our business has been around creating products that women want in need and like I said before menstrual hygiene is something that we entered because we saw a huge need that was missing in the market and clearly so for us the you know we came up with ultra-thin pads we are not the regular low-cost pads right what the woman kept telling us was we need ultra thin pads because we're going out to work we want that comfort you know we don't want rashes and be willing to pay this amount to do that and I think that's how our conversation started with women who were giving birth to babies and then there on we launched a product with the doctors who today recommend it Tomiko I want to share this thought with you it comes from our online audience and they say Shh don't say this out loud boys aren't supposed to know about it this thing and the insecurities we go through hiding it I feel that this film as surely will reduce that idea about stigma how do you go about I don't want your spoiler alert here but how about how do you go about talking about mental hygiene in a Bollywood film it's the story so because it's Mergen anthem story it we've been completely unapologetic about the fact that it's about menstruation it's about a sanitary pad but the of what we've done in and what I think balki has achieved is that he's also made sure that for the first five minutes when you see the movie perhaps you'd be uncomfortable because now you're addressing a topic that you've never addressed before but after that you're in in the story and all the things that even jaideep spoke about about you know how he really interact with women by people close to them talking and about how he says that he has colon childbirth which is important to men with menstruation is something that is also there in our film where the protagonist realizes that you know perhaps if his wife continues using and hygienic rags it could lead to her being you know sterile so we've done that and also what we've done very clearly is that our messaging is such and because of Morgan infants character it's not a preachy movie it's not a movie where we are going to give you a sermon because even as a mother I know that if I'm going to give my children a lecture then I'm like a television remote my mouth is moving but nobody's really listening so here we've again made it entertaining we've made it breezy and still our message hopefully will come through loud and clear mmm debater and creative is there anything you want to ask twinkle it's not often it you get the producer of a major movie about to open right here to talk to the waiter well sprinkle sure I think my biggest question to twinkle would be did you think of any large-scale outcomes that this movie would have you know Audion said definitely you thought about it as a conversation starter a story that you want can a communicate an inspirational person but beyond that I think for people working in the space if you had an outcome in mind it's easier for us to rally your voices behind that outcome because with the use of path there is I mean like at least for me as the women's health advocate it's a it's a long story right it doesn't just start with menstruation goes all the way to menopause and if your menstruation isn't right then it it affects you in different parts of your life I'll about the disposal right like we are working with twink Oh has to say sure good question so when I began this journey I first wrote my column in 2015 it was my first column and menstruation and then I wrote a book in 2016 about this and finally 2018 will have the movie I think for me one yes the conversation starter was very important the other thing I was looking at this into is there was a movie and there was also an issue a problem and it was something that I as a woman you know identify with even today if you ask me after doing all this research if I when I go into a temple I have to fight against my ingrained conditioning saying that I'm not committing a blasphemy and and I thought to myself that even as a progressive woman if these thoughts I in my mind and what about the rest of the women who probably not spent so much time researching a subject like menstruation so one is trying to dispel the taboos the other thing that I was talking to Morgan Anthem also about at this point his pads are ninety percent biodegradable and after the firm I'm hoping to raise funding to make it a hundred percent biodegradable so that we do have a sustainable eco-friendly way of managing during our period and and also to help him get his machines into more states and so that a lot more women can use them and earn their livelihoods as well as have access to pads John's my larger picture yeah I think my question is on that line only so I think the one movie is a starter of the conversation so how you're planning this review because this is from Akshay Kumar the star of the film and this is what he hopes the film Warchief have a listen so with uh with the help of our film if we were able to make even the slightest change as little as starting a conversation in people's living rooms about menstrual hygiene I will be happy since it is treated as such a taboo subject not only in rural areas but also in cities guides of course the big idea is to help educate spread awareness and make a change we have taken the first step hopefully the rest of India will follow so twinkle and Nageshwara ready says around thirty million people could watch the movie or the related content when they start discussing this it's no more a taboo that's a lot of pressure is that possible could your movie do that for India what I'm really happy about is that even before the movies released once the trailer was out there the conversations already begun I have seen men who in all these years have never spoken about sanitary pads or menstruation or period discussing it we and as as time is going by yeah I look at you know a lot of women who were not talking about this who were shy are now you know taking pictures holding a sanitary pad up in their hands so once there's a certain shame and embarrassment that disappears then perhaps you know a lot of women maybe in rural areas who are using rags and leaves and things like that we'll say okay maybe we need to manage our budget and what are we very possible and sacrifice something else and go to their husband saying you know maybe you don't need to buy your cigarette or your beedi and I need sanitary pads and I'm hoping that will take place slowly after watching this film I'm looking at a picture here view at Oxford University from earlier on this it says during your press tour talking about Pat man yeah and here you are with Malala yousufzai which is unusual yeah at that conversation this gives you a sense of how big this is and then addressing Oxford Uni as well what is this light that I did this is global it's not just about menstruation and mention you're hiding in India people around the world are really interested and the other thing also I feel that the other thing that I want to talk about is why sanitary pads are treated as luxury items and why the tax and they're taxed all over the world they taxed in India at 12% they taxed in the UK there tax in many states in America and I think again it's because women as a group we are not standing up and really and and because of this embarrassment about our own biology we're not standing up and say that this is ridiculous you know why is viagra tax-free in certain states why a condom stacks in India and why not sanitary pads let me just bring in this thoughts here first of all padma movie should reach out to the rural areas of india hope it turns out to be a revolution in india as far as sanitary pads are concerned JD this is what you do all the time we've been doing this for many years do you think that a movie might be a great educational tool and this one in particular yes absolutely because they talks this topic in a entertaining way and as like a choice doing this he is lovable across the country and across the globe so I think the men would get affected a lot along with the girls and that would help Vietnam lot of change I'm looking here at some of the projects that you are doing that Subbaiah is doing right now Zubaydah's are doing right now and it's about getting access to menstruation products to sanitary towels tell us about the idea of the simplicity ideas evader about people being out of buy pads and then helping other people in other parts of the world sure so our statistics indicate that about 800 million women men straight every single day and more than half of them don't have access to pads and for us to be able to provide access and education around their reproductive health lifecycle we launched this campaign called go with confident start shop in the US which hopefully we launched in the UK pretty soon as well where we want women who can afford to buy pads for themselves and we will donate a pad to a woman in need so basically if I am buying a packet for myself i will donate exactly the same packet to a woman in India this way we're kind of bringing a global collective voice of women to not only help empower themselves but help other help empower other girls in need as well all right and jay-z I love this here on the this tweet here periods will not stop me period that's your campaign called freedom from shame to create this happiness across India and several states and as I said we try to follow you this chart or take this topic in a different way where we talk about the science instead of the myths and taboos and we like to take this campaign forward and reach out to girls we also work in a similar model as Isis doing with a organization based out of us called Cora woman so they sales organic tampons in us and once the sale one packet of tampons they give us money and we through education programs awareness programs as well as give one packet free of course to school girls in tribal areas across India twink oh you are doing this extensive press junket you are talking about menstrual hygiene to the whole world are you broad yet I think I think I'd probably get tired of this once I hit menopause and I think some part of it will resonate with me alright thank you so much Twinkle Khanna zubeida bye and J deep mundo remember our conversation continues online using hashtag a day stream I will leave you with another song from the film Pat man luckily many hot on 7 October a Siebert management school mystic energy
