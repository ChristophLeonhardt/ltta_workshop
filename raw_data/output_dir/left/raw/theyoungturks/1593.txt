1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,130
UNFORTUNATELY A VOLCANO ERUPTED
ON THE STATE OR ISLAND OF

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,770
HAWAII.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:15,949
EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED, HAWAII
IS A WONDERFUL STATE.

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:22,550
BUT SOME FOLKS ñ THIS BRINGS US
TO THIS LEGENDARY PICTURE TAKEN

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,850
BY MARIO.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,270
HE HEARD THE VOLCANO ERUPTED AND
HE THOUGHT THIS IS A GOOD

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,710
PLACE TO GET A VIEW OF IT.

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,000
HE FIGURES OUT PEOPLE WOULD BE
LOOKING AT IT BUT FINDS THAT

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,320
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GOLFING.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
UNREAL.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:53,440
HE TOOK ONE MORE PICTURE HERE ñ
GOTTA LOVE HOW CALM THE PEOPLE

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,829
OF HAWAII ARE.

13
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:01,380
THAT THERE WERE TWO FUN PARTS OF
THE STORY, ONE IS THE NAME OF

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,210
THE GOLF CLUB, IT IS CALLED THE
VOLCANO GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB.

15
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:15,900
NO CLUB HAS EVER BEEN NAMED
MORE ACCURATELY.

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,400
THE PHOTOGRAPHER WENT ON THE
FAIRWAY TO TAKE THIS PICTURE AND

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,190
THE GOLFERS WERE LIKE GET OUT OF
THE FAIRWAY, AND THEY SHOOED HIM

18
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:44,720
OFF AND HE THEY SAID
THIS ABOUT HIM.

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
THESE GUYS ARE

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,970
GOING TO BE GOLFING LEGENDS.

21
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:58,350
THEY ARE LASER FOCUSED.

22
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,729
THE
PLANET IS ERUPTING, IT IS ON

23
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:09,310
FIRE AND THEY ARE OBLIVIOUS.

24
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:25,800
LET ME SHOW YOU A CHART OF
WHAT 

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,580
IS HAPPENING.

26
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,180
IT IS OFF THE CHARTS.

27
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,890
MEANWHILE WHAT DO WE HAVE?

28
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,190
WE
HAVE THIS GUY PLAYING THROUGH.

29
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,700
UNFORTUNATELY THAT PICTURE FUN

30
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,650
AND FUNNY IN SOME WAYS.

31
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:51,370
THOSE FOLKS ARE FINE, BUT IT IS
ALSO SYMBOLIC AND WE CANNOT

32
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,790
EVACUATE THE PLANET.

33
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,110
I KNOW ELON MUSK IS TRYING HARD
BUT WE ARE NOT THERE YET.

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,340
WE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT
THE VOLCANO AND MAYBE DO

35
00:03:00,340 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
