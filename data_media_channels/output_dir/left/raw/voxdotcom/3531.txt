1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,649
The Iran deal is defective at its core.
The United States will withdraw from the

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,040
Iran nuclear deal.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,760
Trump has been saying
he wants to exit the Iran nuclear deal

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,620
for a long time.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,160
A deal that has so far
prevented Iran from developing nuclear

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,260
weapons.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,890
The United States no longer
makes empty threats. When I make promises,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,440
I keep them.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,219
This is a massive reversal
of US foreign policy with far-reaching

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,040
consequences.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,379
So why does Trump hate the
deal? What exactly does he want and how

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,920
did we get here?

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,680
This was something that
President Obama, when he took office, said

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,910
was his priority and when it was signed
in 2015 this was the high mark of his

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,790
presidency.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,239
It's also interestingly
something that the US had been involved

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,480
in for decades.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,379
When the Shah was in
power in Iran the US had helped him

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,240
develop a civilian nuclear program.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,010
There was concern decades later that the

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,119
new government of Iran was gonna try to
take that program and develop a nuclear

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,680
weapon.

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,400
This deal, the deal that President
Trump just pulled out of, was the world's

24
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,100
attempt to prevent war and to get Iran
to stop that pursuit of a weapon without

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,140
forcing it to.

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,220
So that's ultimately how we got to the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action,

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,729
the formal name for the Iran
deal, signed not just by Iran and the

28
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,500
United States, but also the UK, France,
Germany, Russia, China, and the European Union.

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,770
At its broadest, the deal imposed a
set of restrictions on how Iran

30
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,450
developed nuclear capabilities in
exchange for the U.S.. reducing economic

31
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,200
sanctions.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,240
Now the way the JCPOA was
structured the president recertified it

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,180
every 90 days or those sanctions would
kick back in.

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,060
Trump had threatened this

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,840
outcome for months but is just now
enacting it.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,200
He thinks the Iranians can't be trusted,
he thinks the deal is not strict enough,

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,950
and he thinks that Iran isn't abiding by
the spirit of the deal because they're

38
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,060
doing things like develop long-range
missiles.

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,909
The thing is three of Trump's

40
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,038
own top officials were very much in
favor of the deal but only one still

41
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,200
holds their office.

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,980
If we can determine that this is in our best interest

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,800
then clearly we should stay with it.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,870
Americans agree with the Secretary of

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,810
Defense -- a recent poll shows a majority
of respondents back the agreement

46
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,209
including 68 percent of Democrats, 51
percent of Independents, and even a slim

47
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,819
plurality of Republicans, 46 percent,
supported the deal while 42 percent

48
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,640
opposed it.

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,280
And America's allies strongly
urged the US and Trump to stay committed

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,600
to the deal as well.

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,960
What do you have as
a better option?

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,190
I don't see it.

53
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,120
What is the what-if scenario or your
plan B?

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,329
I don't have any plan before

55
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,020
nuclear are against against Iran.

56
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,910
We are of the opinion that the JCPOA is a first

57
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,560
step but Trump believes he can negotiate
better terms.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,799
They are going to want to

59
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,160
make a new and lasting deal, one that
benefits all of Iran and the Iranian

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,120
people.

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,739
The original deal imposed strict
limits and monitoring of Iran's nuclear

62
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,560
program.

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,329
Iran was forced to get rid of
the vast majority of the uranium it had

64
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,639
already enriched, as well as get rid of
most of the centrifuges that it used to

65
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,920
enrich that uranium.

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,650
Under the deal Iran
also couldn't enriched uranium past the

67
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,970
threshold for producing nuclear energy,
which is significantly lower than the

68
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,220
threshold from medical uranium and
weapons-grade uranium.

69
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,109
The UN's nuclear

70
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:45,660
agency has verified that Iran complied
with the deal which is also what makes

71
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,919
the U.S. leaving so significant,
especially right now on the cusp of

72
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,560
negotiations with North Korea over its
own nuclear program.

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
In fact at this very

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,849
moment secretary Pompeo is on his way to
North Korea in preparation for my

75
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:06,340
upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-Un.

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,330
But here's the thing: if you're the

77
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,300
North Korean government and especially
if you're Kim Jong-Un and you're

78
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,360
watching what just happened with the
Iran deal, why would you believe that if

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,820
you struck a deal with President Trump
that the next president would stick to it?

80
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,500
If you've just seen literally the
United States tear up the previous deal

81
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,169
they'd signed with the country to get
that country to give up its nuclear

82
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,250
program and that's why President Trump's
decision to plow Iran deal is so

83
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,940
dangerous.

84
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,960
Europe believes the deal works.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,540
European companies are doing business

86
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,260
with Iran.

87
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,900
So this isn't just a blow
diplomatically it's also a blow

88
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,520
financially to many of our closest
allies around the world.

89
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,780
Mr. President, how does this make America safer?

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
How does this make America safer?

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you very much. This will make America much safer.
