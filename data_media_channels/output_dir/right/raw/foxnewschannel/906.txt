1
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:13,390
>> Laura: JUSTIN MOMENTS AGO,

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,724
HOUSE G.O.P. RELEASING THE TEXT

3
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:15,425
OF THEIR NEW IMMIGRATION

4
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:16,193
PROPOSAL EXPECTED TO BE BROUGHT

5
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:18,628
TO THE FLOOR AS EARLY AS NEXT

6
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:19,062
WEEK.

7
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:19,329
WOW.

8
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:20,864
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

9
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:22,866
AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS: ENDING THE

10
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,301
CONTROVERSIAL POLICY DOES CATCH

11
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,035
AND RELEASE ENSURING MINERS WHO

12
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:26,436
ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY ARE

13
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,838
NOT SEPARATED FROM THE PARENTS.

14
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:29,439
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DRAW MORE

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,173
PEOPLE AND PARENT CALLS FOR AN

16
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:33,610
END LOTTERY SYSTEM.

17
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,279
BUT INSTEAD REALLOCATE FOR

18
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,415
55,000 VISAS TO SUPPOSEDLY A

19
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:39,850
MERIT-BASED PROGRAM.

20
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,650
LET'S DISCUSS WITH CONGRESSMAN

21
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,084
RON DeSANTIS.

22
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,019
AND MONEY FOR THE WALL, BARELY.

23
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:45,255
25 BILLION FOR THE WALL.

24
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:46,690
RON, NO E-VERIFY WHICH I'M TOLD

25
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,725
DOESN'T MATTER I THINK IT

26
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:50,226
MATTERS.

27
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:51,227
THE CHAMBER DOESN'T LIKE

28
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:51,828
E-VERIFY.

29
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:53,530
E-VERIFY MEANS YOU DON'T GET TO

30
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,631
WORK UNLESS YOU ARE VERIFIED TO

31
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:57,600
BE LEGALLY IN THE COUNTRY,

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:57,934
CORRECT?

33
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:58,568
CHAMBER DOESN'T WANTED.

34
00:00:58,568 --> 00:01:02,839
>> IF YOU ARE DOING AN AMNESTY

35
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,274
THAT'S 1.8, MOVING MORE MILLION

36
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:04,607
PEOPLE.

37
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,109
>> Laura: WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT

38
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,944
IN THE BULLETS.

39
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:09,245
>> IT'S GOING TO CREATE AN

40
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:10,447
INCENTIVE FOR MORE PEOPLE TO

41
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:11,247
COME ILLEGALLY.

42
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,483
IF YOU DON'T HAVE E-VERIFY TO

43
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:14,684
KIND OF REMOVE A DISINCENTIVE,

44
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:17,020
THAT WALL, EVEN IF IT'S A GOOD

45
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,154
FAITH EFFORT AT THE WALL, AND

46
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:19,989
I'M NOT SURE IT IS, IT AIN'T

47
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:22,025
GOING TO BE BUILT IN A DAY.

48
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,093
YOU NEED TO STRIP THE COURTS OF

49
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:23,526
JURISDICTION.

50
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:25,095
THIS WILL GET TIED UP FOREVER

51
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:25,962
WITH THE WALL.

52
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:26,830
WITHOUT E-VERIFY COMING OR GOING

53
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,631
TO HAVE A BORDER SURGE LIKE WE

54
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,834
HAD IN 2014.

55
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:31,568
THAT OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO HAVE

56
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:35,438
A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING.

57
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:36,606
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

58
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:41,878
MOVE PRODUCT ACROSS THE BORDER.

59
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:42,679
DRUG CARTELS.

60
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:43,880
>> Laura: 293 PAGES.

61
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,515
WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO GO

62
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,050
THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.

63
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,351
>> THE GOODLATTE BILL HAS WHAT

64
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:49,352
WE CAMPAIGNED ON.

65
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:50,887
THE GOODLATTE BILL AND CHAIN

66
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:51,254
MIGRATION.

67
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:53,790
WE DO THEY SAY THEY WON'T GET IT

68
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,123
THROUGH.

69
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:55,058
IT'S NOT GOING TO PASS THE

70
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:55,458
SENATE.

71
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,861
PROBABLY WILL PASS THE HOUSE,

72
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,796
ALTHOUGH PAUL RYAN IS GOING TO

73
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:01,431
BRING IT NEXT WEEK.

74
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,065
GOODLATTE WAS INVOLVED IN

75
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:02,632
RUNNING THE NEW BILL.

76
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:04,133
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS OR NOT.

77
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,836
>> WE NEED TO DEFUND SANCTUARY

78
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:07,236
CITIES.

79
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:09,072
WE NEED E-VERIFY, END CHAIN

80
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:10,573
MIGRATION, GET RID OF THE VISA

81
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,842
DIVERSITY LOTTERY.

82
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,277
MAY PEOPLE GO ON RECORD.

83
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:15,645
IT'S NOT A POPULAR VOTE IN THE

84
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:18,047
REPUBLICAN PARTY BUT EVEN IN THE

85
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,015
DEMOCRATS DISTRICT, PEOPLE WANT

86
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:19,482
E-VERIFY.

87
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,951
IT'S NOT EVEN A PARTISAN THING

88
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:23,453
AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL.

89
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:24,354
>> Laura: BUSINESS DOESN'T

90
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,055
WANT E-VERIFY SO THE MONEY IS

91
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:26,723
COMING INTO THESE CAMPAIGNS.

92
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:29,626
THEY DO NOT WANT TO CHECK THE

93
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:30,627
IDENTITY OF PEOPLE.

94
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:32,895
>> THAT MEANS IT UNDERMINES THE

95
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,197
RULE OF LAW, HARMS TAXPAYERS AND

96
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,665
LOWERS WAGES FOR AMERICANS.

97
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,033
>> Laura: BUT THEY WILL SAY

98
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,267
IT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO.

99
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,637
AND IT DOES ADDRESS SOME OF THE

100
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:41,270
CHAIN MIGRATION.

101
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,040
WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH IT ADDRESSES.

102
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,842
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMNESTY

103
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:47,743
COULD REACH PARENTS AS WELL.

104
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,679
IT'S NOT JUST THE DREAMERS.

105
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,246
PARENTS ARE INCLUDED.

106
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,447
>> IT'S GOING TO THE SENATE AND

107
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,682
EITHER DIED OR THEY'RE GOING TO

108
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:53,082
MAKE YOURS.

109
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:55,485
THOSE WERE THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS.

110
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:56,552
THE SENATE AIN'T GOING TO JUST

111
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,421
PASS THIS.

112
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,123
SO YOU'RE REALLY RUNNING A RISK.

113
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:01,524
>> Laura: DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.

114
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:04,427
THEY SAY THE FREEDOM CAUCUS

115
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:05,227
PEOPLE, YOU NEVER CAN GOVERN.

116
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,629
YOU SAY YOU WANT TO GET

117
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:08,064
SOMETHING DONE BUT THEN WHEN YOU

118
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:09,732
CAN GET SOMETHING DONE, LIMIT

119
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,436
CHAIN MIGRATION, BRING DOWN THE

120
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:15,171
VISA, YOU SAY NO, WERE NOT GOING

121
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:15,538
TO DO IT.

122
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:17,173
>> THE GOAL IS TO END ILLEGAL

123
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:17,873
IMMIGRATION.

124
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:18,841
THIS WOULD FEEL MORE ILLEGAL

125
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,443
IMMIGRATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE

126
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:21,644
THINGS LIKE E-VERIFY.

127
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:22,912
WILL IT WORK?

128
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:23,312
YES OR NO.

129
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:23,979
>> Laura: THE PRESIDENT HAS

130
00:03:23,979 --> 00:00:00,000
GOT TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT
