Hi, my name is Yurleidis Córdoba Mena
and I'm here to tell you about the Interethnic School.
The Interethnic School is a space that hosts and protects
young people of different ethnicity
who are mestizo, Afro-Colombian, and Indigenous.
My name is Erika Orijuela Quinto
How did the Interethnic school begin?
It was created through the work of ethno-territorial organisations
because of the armed conflict
that affected and is affecting young people in the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.
The Interethnic School is a space of protection
grounded in a base of community, interethnic, and intergenerational
exchange of knowledge and experiences
to strengthen the capacities of participants
which provides the development of strategies for solutions
against the  and gaps in protection
to which young people are exposed.
It is a traveling school, which is to say it's mobile.
It does not have a space, or a permanent/constant physical space
the places where it mostly does its work are principally: the basin of Rio Truandó
Salaquí and Cacarica.
Hi, my name is Maryurí Mosquera Palacio
I am part of the Interethnic Youth Leadership School in the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.
The expectation that I have for the Interethnic School in 2019 is a more inclusive school
considering that the 200 young people who take part are not the only young people in the municipality and  local authorities.
I would also like if in 2019
the Interethnic School took all the young people in the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.
So that it's not a limited quota but an open quota
considering that this is a space that allows young people
to gain knowledge in an area of ​​protection and in the care of the territory.
Thank you very much.
Hi, my name is Yarlenis Córdoba Ramos

Everyone who wants to support us, well the door is open. Thank you.
