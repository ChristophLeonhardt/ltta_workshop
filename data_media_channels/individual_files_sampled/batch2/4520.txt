we love our country we respect our flag and we always proudly stand for the national anthem we always will stand for the national anthem as you watch this next segment please remember not one of the Superbowl champion Philadelphia Eagles took a knee during any of their games last season nonetheless at what was supposed to be an eagle celebration president Trump followed through today on his promise to hold instead a ceremony where we would hear loudly and proudly played the national anthem this came after the president's surprise decision last night canceling this event hosting the Super Bowl champion Eagles claiming they disagreed with the custom of standing for the national anthem this morning the White House blamed the cancellation on the football team saying quote the vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins responded to the president quote it's hard to meet people who don't agree with you and to have tough conversations about uncomfortable race related issues and how to make positive change instead the decision was made to lie and paint the picture that these players are anti-america anti-flag and anti-military Philadelphia's mayor Jim Kenney dismissed Trump's decision in an interview today Donald Trump is meaningless to this whole process it's meaningless he's meaningless to the city and the city success he's trying every chance he gets to tear cities down and eventually he'll be gone one way or the other and at a briefing this afternoon the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly blamed the Eagles for what she called a political stunt our own Peter Alexander asked Sanders about the president seemingly inconsistent views on free speech these days so I guess my question is simple so if the White House supports the Baker's right of free speech why doesn't the white house support the players right into free speech the president doesn't think that this is an issue simply a free speech he thinks it's about respecting the men and women of our military it's about respecting our National Anthem and it's about standing out of pride for that Jill Colvin and Jonathan Lemire of The Associated Press right of trumps decision to disinvite the Eagles quote it was another sign the Trump intends to continue to fan a culture war he has stoked and which he has long believed as a winning issue with his base Trump has long fixated on the NFL national anthem controversy and was pleased when last month's announcement of the league's new policy returned it to the news the president told one confidant Monday that he aimed to periodically revive the anthem issue in the months ahead believing its return to the headlines would help Republicans as the midterm elections approached let's talk about this now and with us to do that Charlie Sykes author and longtime conservative radio host who is now contributing editor and podcast host for the Weekly Standard we should also mention he's from Wisconsin I seem to remember they have a football team there and Jason Johnson politics editor at the root Jason welcome back to the broadcast I'd like to begin with you my Sundays took an awful turn with a horrendous head coaching choice by my beloved New York Giants a few years ago we're in recovery now but all of us who love Sunday's in season have been forced to let politics enter even that day and what do you see is happening to the process now how far have we gotten from the reason of the protests in the first place I think the protests you know Brian the protests have always been clear Colin Kapernick everyone involved has said look these protests are about police brutality and institutional racism the players have said that consistently that that is the motivation behind them taking a knee or any kind of protest that they engaged in and the President of the United States and certain members of the right have simply refused to listen to it it's not an issue of they just disagree they've simply said we refuse to listen to what you're saying is the motivation behind your protests and the problem that sort of larger cultural problem Brian that I've seen with this is it turns Sunday's which used to be a fun day I'm a Seahawks fan a former Eagles fan it used to take a taken a fun day and turned it into a political wedge issue now you have people who literally will shame you if you want to watch football or complain because players are doing this that the other the president has taken something sacred on a Sunday and turned it into a problem just so that he can achieve a certain amount of points with with racial invective and class warfare and it's shameful and to Charlie in a state where Sunday really is close to a football version of a religious holiday yes as issues go this is a shiny object this is not the summit talks that are about to go on with North Korea it's not the Russia investigation it is football after all but think of the collateral damage this week Charlie football players have been accused of lacking patriotism they've been effused accused of being anti military yeah well well first of all we've got to note that this is a lie that in fact none of the players did take a knee but this has two advantages for Donald Trump it's a distraction and it is a target to focus the grievance of his base on and this has been his playbook all along and he thinks about how this plays in red America and he believes that that he if he pits the flag the military if he talks about these things against these pampered players he's going to win and even if you have this collateral damage and Jason is absolutely right by the way you know Wisconsin very divided political state but the one thing we all believe in is football and the Green Bay Packers and you know Donald Trump touching this has taken his willingness to use this kind of divisive politics to score points he's taken it into our Sunday's but look this is something he thinks he can win on this issue he thinks that the culture he's comfortable with the culture war issues he thinks that is it resonates with his base you're gonna see a lot more and by the way a memo to the NFL and anybody else who is targeted in a Donald Trump culture war you notice that appeasement does not work gracious gracious surrender does not get you what you want he sees that as a sign of weakness that he doubles down hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out
