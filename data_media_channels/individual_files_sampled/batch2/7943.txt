first of all it seems that nobody in the Trump administration is ready to reunite kids with their families after a court order now they are doing DNA testing on kids to match them with their parents lawyers for children in custody have reported that government officials have been approaching them for blood and saliva that's particularly worrisome because a there's no way that these kids are consenting to DNA tests and be do we really want a government database of which kids have which DNA and where they come from especially being non-citizens the children are currently being held by the health by Health and Human Services the HHS secretary had this to say you reference the deadline is artificial so I'm not sure what that means as far as you being able to meet that deadline but are you confident that every child will be accounted for Oh every child is accounted for we know every child where they are we know we know what our records the last time any kid had their fingernail fingernails clip we have comprehensive records on eleven thousand eight hundred kids in our care in custody and so we will comply with the court's order now we will work with the court we are doing so today to get clarification and hopefully support from the court to allow us to do our job to ensure that in fact these are parents of the children and ensure that they are suitable suitable individuals to go back to these parents for we're doing DNA testing on everybody who claims to be the parent of one of our children to confirm that we checked birth certificates we have surged two hundred and thirty HHS people and contractors out to ice facilities to sit with the parents to get information to prove suitability and parentage of them to work through this process because what we care about is the kids welfare that's the chief concern there yeah I do buy though that that they have accounted for the fingernail clippings there's good DNA in them exactly right Beach I hate when people seemingly ask for credit for doing the bare minimum of what they should be doing which are they even doing the bare minimum I mean well actually that you know the court said that they do have to return the kids but so far they haven't at all there's over three thousand children still being held by HHS and I mean they have you know I think the next deadline for children under five is by next Tuesday it doesn't seem like they're gonna hit it they're pushing against it pretty hard way to get a court order so that kids can be able to call their parents that would be fantastic well it sounds like from the beginning of that video that he had referred to that deadline as artificial yeah I guess I guess a judge just said it I guess that's artificial right test that in other areas of life when you're potentially gonna be committing a crime but I mean the fear is that they are not actually equipped to do so they can say that they surged any number of different employees there if they weren't initially getting the information they needed and they were shipping kids off around the country it's possible that you can't actually reverse that I mean it almost doesn't seem like they really had a plan to begin with it doesn't seem like they thought that they would get enough pushback on this that they would have to reunite their families and I think it's worth asking what happens on Tuesday if they don't meet this deadline what happens in 30 days if they don't return any kids what recourse do we really have are we going to jail the HHS right I think that kind of question is frustrating especially with the Trump administration pushing back to try and indefinitely detain kids and their parents together which no due process no real opportunity to to leave unless they sign a piece of paper saying that they agree to be deported with their kids it's a horrible situation for for the kids and the parents no real way out yeah I actually I have no idea what the recourse would be if they don't actually fit it maybe they've got something in the actual decision but at the end of the day again judicial decisions matter because we say that they matter right and if we stop saying that they matter I mean god only knows what Trump is capable of I mean that's that's almost right that's the role of law enforcement but law enforcement seems to be working for their side so I don't know it's yes frustrating and horrifying and we'll see my fear overall I talked about this briefly in the first hour is that I mean although there were massive protests over the weekend there were 700 protests not that long ago my fear is always the same in American politics when it comes to American media that people will move on especially because there's again so much that happens Scott Pruett you know just resigned that's gonna take up a lot of the the oxygen the room we just said the 4th of July we've got the Supreme Court coming up soon I mean are people gonna focus on this I think that there are some people who were convinced by his little executive order and think that this situation has been resolved when we're largely in the same situation we were a month ago absolutely and you know we talked about what would happen if they just don't abide by these deadlines I think what's scary for me it's like we're discussing the some DNA testing that's happening it's seemingly against everyone's will unfortunately this is just where we are now would it have been better if this never happened in the first place absolutely correct is there a better way to reunite these families I'm not sure but also I think what's most upsetting is that we are in the space that um if this administration doesn't get court approval to indefinitely hold these children detain these children then these this reunion essentially comes with a potential warning for a future possible split mm-hmm which is upsetting yeah yeah I mean obviously the the better situation is to never have had this situation the first time not as a family separations not of the mandatory prosecutions we did not do that before not even before Donald Trump in the first part of Donald Trump we didn't even do that that is a thing that they decided unilaterally to begin they created every bit of this crisis of themselves because of their choices because of their callous cruel politically motivated choices to attempt to fire up their base or to attempt to get some sort of hard right immigration bill passed whatever the reason was they chose to do this and so them complaining that it's difficult to fix because people rightly are paying attention and brightly care about what's going on I don't care about those tears I care about the kids being reunited with their families I think also a lot of the pushback is incredibly frustrating because you know first they they're holding kids hostage to try to get funding for the wall now there's there's the report that parents are being given a form that only has two options on it one of which is I agree to be deported with my child and I agree to be deported without my child that's not a real choice you know and the fact that the Trump administration is framing it like well we're doing everything we can to solve this situation is it's worse than dishonest I mean it's cruel and it and it violates so many international laws yeah and just even some of the discussion um they should have used a port of entry or stayed home we're talking about asylum seekers we're talking about people who are not safe this that is I guess you insensitive at the least it's the same search Alice that greeted the Syrian refugees you can only get help that we agree you need if you come through the right door that I II mean come on two easy
