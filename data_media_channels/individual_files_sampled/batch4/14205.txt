Canadian Environment and climate change Minister Catherine McKenna sure hates her little nickname and she thinks it's gender-based harassment but this brave warrior for women's rights is noticeably silent when the UN climate change conference in Bonn Germany became a slithering snake pit of real sexual harassment the annual UN climate change conference just wrapped up in Bonn Germany it was an opulent and luxurious affair were the world's leading environmentalists and progressive politicians pat themselves on the back for yet another year well spent finding new ways to tax you inconvenient to you and control your lives I know because I was there I was there to see the diesel powered and heated tents the diesel powered lighting the luxury riverboat cruises and the dozens of other hypocritical things that these environmentalists don't want you to do but have absolutely no problem doing themselves but I was there from the outside I was banned from this year's conference because I asked a question just a single question of a member of the Canadian delegation last year at the very same conference that was held in Morocco the UN said my one single question constituted harassment but I went to this year's conference anyway because well for starters I'm not one to listen to the United Nations bureaucrats telling me what to do and secondly because I know I can do as much real journalism from the outside of any of these events as any accredited yet sycophantic media from the inside but now I'm sort of glad that I was on the outside because it sounds like it wasn't exactly a very welcoming place for women on the inside of this UN conference reports are now that at least 10 people reported instances of sexual harassment against them at the UN conference this year the UN climate change Framework communications director and incidentally the same person who banned me for harassment NIC Nuttall confirmed there were complaints saying and I quote there have to my knowledge being a handful complaints here in Bonn my understanding is that the people concerned after raising the issue to the UN and other relevant authorities did not wish to proceed to any further formal process and the UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said the conference did not have enough money for a dedicated team on sexual harassment oh but friends they had money for parties lots of parties but in other words they anticipated a need for a sexual harassment liaison unit but determined it was also not in the budget well isn't that interesting and I have a sneaking suspicion although I can't confirm it that this sort of harassment is a bit of an ongoing problem at these UN conferences given that on at least two separate occasions the UN warned that there would be a zero-tolerance policy this year for sexual harassment now I know that as a result of recent sexual harassment allegations coming out of Hollywood out of politics and now even out of journalism people are far more sensitive to sexual harassment claims lately but all of those feels like the UN sort of expected it coming and unless I misinterpreted it the statement from the UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa indicates at least to me that it was something they must have anticipated otherwise why did they say they didn't have the money for a dedicated team or this year's UN climate change conference there was something called gender day where the UN reinforced the victimhood complex that many left-wing feminists seem to have with regard to climate change there were even gender-based events at the UN climate change conference in Bonn Germany like this high-level event called the economic case for gender responsive climate action I have no idea what that means ironically the UN is constantly prattling on about how climate change hurts women the most like droughts and floods and severe weather going round looking for places that women normally congregate like I don't know my nail place or the garden center or the Lululemon store and it's a bizarre-o sentiment also repeated by Canada's Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and in fairness she was also widely mocked for saying so but you know what whereas I would normally join in the choir of mockery even honestly leading it sometimes this time I find myself agreeing with Catherine McKenna and the UN when they say that climate change hurts women the most because if conferences dedicated to fighting climate change result in double-digit claims of sexual harassment they might actually be on to something here about gender-based targeting except it's not climate change targeting women it's the climate change industry acting as a predatory force against the females of our species anywhere these self-described male feminists and their female enablers gather together women are really not all that safe in progressive newsrooms in Hollywood and now at climate change conferences hosted by the UN oh and about my friend climate Barbie Catherine McKenna well she hasn't had too much to say about real sexual harassment from her side of the aisle the only time we hear from her fighting for women's rights is when she feels they are unfairly targeted by inclement weather or when she doesn't like my little nickname for her climate Barbie I just would like a commitment that you will not call me names that you won't talk about the color of my hair that you won't make fun of me that the reason I'm asking you not to do this is because I have two daughters that there are lots of girls that want to get into politics and it is completely unacceptable that you do this but when one of her colleagues either at the UN or even closer to home in the Liberal caucus are accused of harassment and predatory behavior like Liberal MPs Darsh and King and Hunter - - well then McKenna clams right up really it's just like Hollywood at the UN with the lavish parties and the self-congratulations and living in literal sheltered bubbles and if you spout the official talking points if you show up and make friends at all the right parties and are progressive enough in your politics then your behavior is really not all that important anyway give me good old-fashioned chivalry the kind that wouldn't have let two female journalists freeze in the cold for a week in Germany because of their politics over the FEMEN just progressive treatment of women any day for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read to catch up on all my coverage from the UN climate change conference in Bonn Germany and to help pitch in to cover the cost of our trip there go to rebel un com you
