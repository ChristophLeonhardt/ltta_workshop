there's just so many great girls in this issue you know you have some very very recognizable faces in our group and then you have you know relative unknowns you know that even within the industry people are like oh that's a new one you know and then you have people like Haley who transitioned from a high fashion background she's a bombshell when she came in we immediately knew I met MJ and the team from Sports Illustrated about a year ago and they were casting for this up-and-coming issue that's about to come out that day I got a call that I was going to be shooting in two weeks in Hawaii it was just a new step in my career that I really really was so excited to start I started modeling when i was 13 i went into an open call and ford in LA and then from there I kind of just started working moved to New York when I was 15 started doing Fashion Week traveled the world and just kind of did the whole fashion thing so it's nice to transition into the sexy swimsuit world I would say the difference between the swimsuit word on the fashion world is fashions a little more it's a different type of girl you're bringing it's a little more different characters and I think when you're shooting for Sports Illustrated you really get to be yourself and you know it's kind of rare these days everyone's very very relaxed from the crew they're all just cool nice people but I was a little nervous and so it was my first time shooting for them and I think the first few shots i was like huh what do i do and then i slowly just felt comfortable and started to relax and it was a lot easier once I did that it's an honor to be headed to that list with all those amazing top models that I've always admired because I love fashion and I've looked at Sports Illustrated since I was a little girl so it's kind of kind of seems fake right now to me that it's happening but I mean it's such an honor to be a part of that crowd of girls
