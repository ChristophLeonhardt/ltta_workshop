so on Friday night Trump administration announced that they were doing bombing of Syrian positions so this is very serious business because he can get entangled in a very messy war in the Middle East number one that's a terrible idea number two the Russians are on the other side god forbid if we were to hit any Russian planes or troops well we could start a much much larger war this is all terrible news for all the rest of us and I know that most of the mainstream media is in favor of this they put on so-called experts day in and day out they got people like Andrea Mitchell who are coming out and saying if Donald Trump wants to be tough he's got to show people that he's tough any you know he can't be like Obama then you've got the war usual war hawks like Lindsey Graham and John McCain saying those things as well and I I'm absolutely against any military intervention in Syria it's a quagmire of extreme proportions and we're gonna get stuck there just like we did in Iraq we're gonna lose a ton of money we're gonna lose a lot of lives and at the end of the day what will have made the situation worse just like we did in Iraq so I think that almost all of us will lose out of this and I think most sane people recognize that certainly American people do they don't want any more Middle Eastern conflict that's part of the reason they voted for Trump Trump said he was gonna get us out of those he said Iraq was a mess and then he was gonna make that mistake in Syria as he bombed Syria today yet another broken promise though was surprised by that but I don't want you to think that no one benefited from these bombings some people very materially benefited and those are the folks who work for defense contractors so let me give you that story fortune reporting that Raytheon stock surged Friday morning after 59 of the company's Tomahawk missiles were used to strike Syria in Donald Trump's first major military operation as president so some people gained a lot or in this case a giant defense contractor so I'm gonna get to my conclusion in saying but let me give you all the facts the Tomahawk missiles used in the strike is made by Raytheon whose stock opened two and a half points higher Friday that's two and a half percentage points adding more than 1 billion dollars to the defense contractors market capitalization so what might have been a disaster for the rest of us was great news for Raytheon to the tune of a billion dollars but it's not just them the shares of other missile and weapons manufacturers including Boeing Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each rose as much as 1% collectively gaining nearly five billion dollars in market value as soon as they began trading even as the broader markets felt so within the context of the markets this was even more outstanding because everything else is falling but they are rising because of the bombings now when I say that this is not a coincidence and that the those same defense contractors pour in millions and actually over a set of years billions in both campaign contributions independent expenditures and lobbying and that they would like a return on their investment and that return on their investment for them because they're met weapons manufacturers is more war people then turn around and especially in the mainstream press and say that sounds a little crisper conspiratorial so let's break that down which part is the conspiracy the part where corporations would like to make more money well if that's a conspiracy it's pretty out and open of course they make more money it's not a matter of even wanting they have a fiduciary responsibility to make more money and in their case they don't produce sneakers they don't produce hamburgers they don't produce textbooks well they produces bombs and aircraft to deliver those bombs and the missile systems to deliver those so they profit from war that's not a conspiracy that's a fact absolute bottom line and you just saw it just today they gained five billion dollars so the idea that they are out of the goodness of their hearts they would be true patriots and say no Raytheon and Lockheed Martin would like nothing but peace so that no one ever buys our materials again and we all go bankrupt that's not only laughable that's a conspiracy theory that's some weird conspiracy that they got together in a room and decided let's make sure that we don't maximize profit does anyone really believe that do you think that the lobbying that those corporations are doing for our politicians and by the way the revolving door that they use for our retired generals where they pay him a ton of money and then have them go on TV and tell us how necessary war is that that's all for their health that's all because they want peace and love and unicorns throughout the planet or could it be that that is to maximize profit exactly as they have a responsibility to do we should have a responsibility to protect our own democracy in our own government and not let them contribute to politicians private financing leads to our politicians working for private interests so don't be surprised the next time we all seem to suffer like in the Iraq war but some people gain very very handsomely and those are the ones contributing to the politicians now overall the Trump Bureau has been fantastic for them as fortune explains the fence contractor stocks have risen and the months as Trump was elected spurred by his promises of a quote historic increase in US military spending the budget Trump proposed last month includes an additional fifty two billion dollars for the Department of Defense Boeing stock has gained nearly 21% since the election while General Dynamics shot stock is up 14% over the same period and yes those are a little too a lot ahead of the gains of the rest of the market for this year and since Trump has been in office so while some of us lose others win big time or as Trump would say Bigley so when you see the disaster unfold in front of your eyes and you ask the question how that have possibly happened this is how it happened for God's sake and the money in politics if you don't these politicians are never going to represent us and they're gonna represent defense contractors that want more war so they can have more profit they're gonna represent gun manufacturers that want more crime and more murder and mayhem so that more people will buy guns and they will make further profit they will represent private prison which wants what more prisoners so they could make more money and maximize profit if you have them serving those companies instead of us we have lost our democracy entirely that is why we make one seemingly bad decision after another it's bad for America but it's great for the private financed ears of our politicians wolf dash pack.com that is a movement to get money out of politics you have to join it right now if we don't get money out of politics and get an amendment to do so these wars will never ever end if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now TYT Network comm
