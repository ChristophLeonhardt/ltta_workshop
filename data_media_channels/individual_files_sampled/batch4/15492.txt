nothing and I mean nothing demonstrates the hypocrisy of the liberal left when it comes to what should be the completely innocuous task of buying beer and wine at the corner store but welcome to Ontario where too many politicians tend to lose their marbles at the mere thought of buddy buying a Bud Light at the local variety store so PC leader Doug Ford had the temerity I mean he had the utter audacity I tell you to suggest that if his party forms the next provincial government beer wine will be available at the corner store Christmas the response from Premier Kathleen Wynne and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath and the president of mothers against drunk driving and all their useful idiots in the media oh it was loud and Swift oh my god it was as old Ford I was suggesting he was gonna take away a woman's right to breastfeed her newborn baby just think about it beer and wine right next to the salt and vinegar potato chips and the gummy bears boom it's in a Huffington Post article premier Wynne called Ford's plan reckless here's what she said you could have a situation where you have marijuana and beer and wine beside the candy bars that's the image we have to reconcile hey premier you don't have to imagine such a scenario for it already exists yeah right here in Ontario there are more than 200 LCBO agency stores in this province these are LCBO mini stores that are located within convenience stores you see folks if an interior community is too small to support a standalone LCBO then the people running the convenience store and the people living in that community are presto suddenly socially responsible enough to buy beer wine and even hard liquor at the local mom pawn shop how do you square that miss Wynn that an aunt Aryan living in say Carleton Place is mature enough to buy booze at a convenience store but an aunt Aryan living in Toronto lacks that maturity give me a break then there's meds Andrew Murray who said Ford's plan would be a quote major step backwards end quote on all the progress the provinces made on curbing impaired driving he says alcohol and convenience stores would mean greater access for youth more intoxicated people being served and more drunk driving oh really based on what data mr. Murray based on what thought process by the way folks the impaired driving rate in Canada is at an all-time low right now but if you believe mr. Miri being able to pick up a six-pack of Labatt blue at max milk is going to turn on Terios highways into a drunken demolition derby and then there's the NDP's Horwath who says she opposes Ford's proposal because Ontario's current sis it's already working fine oh really define fine miss Horwath fine bye whose benchmark you know it's also unintentionally funny on the campaign trail both win Horwath like to say how much they're all about going too bad for the little guy and how Doug Ford is in the pocket of big business well take a look at the operators of so many convenience stores many are first-generation Canadians putting in more than 80 hours a week trying to make a living on razor thin profit margins these are the little guys but obviously when in Horwath are far less concerned with them and far more concerned with big public sector unions in which they are beholden to and newsflash those people running convenience stores are already entrusted to sell age-restricted products from tobacco and lottery to adult magazines and fireworks oh but beer and wine oh no if that were to happen we'll just end up with an Ontario in which I don't know 12 year olds are getting plastered on colt 45 in convenience store parking lots that's what Horwath and Wynne and Miri would like you to believe but you know crossover the Ontario border into Quebec and viscid a de penas and you will instantly see that this is not the reality or is this a matter of Quebecers being more responsible than Ontarians and another thing to consider the idea of buying a six-pack is not merely the desire a PC leader Doug Ford but rather so many Ontarians who are sick of being treated like infants when it comes to alcohol indeed four years ago a petition entitled free our beer was amassed by the interior convenience stores Association it boasted more than four hundred thousand signatures the single largest petition ever submitted to the interior legislature in the provinces history I'm sure a lot of the little guys sign that petition not that they count for much when it comes to the Progressive elites who endeavor to save us from ourselves when it comes to that various act of buying a bottle of beer or wine at the local corner store we're just not mature enough for that yet according to our self-appointed nanny state guardians of the galaxy for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel live is coming up Saturday June the 2nd in Toronto wow what a roster of great speakers as relevant john Cardillo Sheila Gunn read Katie Hopkins oh boy it's going to be great please go to the rebel live.com and get your tickets today
