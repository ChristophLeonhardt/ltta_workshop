death is a natural consequence of life while it marks an end to one adventure it launches the exciting start of another a few minutes after dying something changes within the human body enzymes that break down food for energy during life adopt a new purpose they start targeting the body cells the process is called autologous and is the start of decomposition autologous usually begins in the liver and brain what will eventually digest all internal organs it also breaks open capillaries releasing blood cells that turn the skin pale purple while all of this is starting the body is quickly exhausting its oxygen reserves after two hours muscles which require oxygen to function stiffen into place this is the onset of rigor mortis rigor mortis usually starts in smaller muscles that control the eyelids jaw and neck eventually it will spread to the entire body 12 to 20 hours after death at this point enzymes have dissolved the gastrointestinal tract released a parade of gut bacteria these bacteria are hungry and begin feeding on what's left of the tissues and organs as they go to town they produce gases like methane hydrogen sulfide and ammonia in order to go the gases build up pressure within the abdomen inflating it the pressure also forces liquid out of the body in places like the nose ears and mouth as liquids seep into the surrounding soil they enrich it with elements like nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium during this stage the body also emits a sickly sweet aroma that attracts insects like flesh flies the flies lay their eggs on what's left of the remains which was service food with the eggs hatch 24 hours later the entire decomposition process can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to multiple months it all depends on the temperature of your the hotter it is the faster your enzymes can go to work digesting you from the inside out in a place like San Francisco for example where temperatures are around 70 degrees it would only take about 16 days
