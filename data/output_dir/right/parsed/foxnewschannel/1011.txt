>> Bret: THE SHOCK WAVES ARE
STILL REVERBERATING THROUGH THE
WESTERN WORLD TONIGHT AFTER
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFIANT
APPEARANCE AT THE G-7 ECONOMIC
SUMMIT IN CANADA.
HE'S CONTINUING HIS FAT WITH
CANADA'S PRIME MINISTER OVER
TRADE ISSUES.
CORRESPONDENT PETER DOOCY TELLS
US WHERE THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW.
>> WORLD LEADERS LEAN IN AND TRY
TO SQUEEZE PRESIDENT TRUMP ON
TRADE, BUT HE'S AS CONVINCED AS
EVER AT THE U.S. IS GETTING
RIPPED OFF, ESPECIALLY BY CANADA
TWEETING FAIR TRADE IS NOW TO BE
CALLED FULL TRADE IF IT IS NOT
RECIPROCAL.
ACCORDING TO A CANADA RELEASE,
THEY MAKE ALMOST $100 BILLION IN
TRADE WITH THE U.S.
NOW SOME CONSERVATIVES ARE
CHEERING PRESIDENT TRUMPS
TOUGHNESS ON TRADE.
>> THE DAYS OF THE UNITED STATES
BEING THE PIGGYBACK FOR THE
WORLD ARE OVER.
>> BUT CANADIANS ARE NOW
THREATENING NEW TARIFFS IF
PRESIDENT TRUMP TEARS UP TRADE
AGREEMENTS.
>> WE ARE POLITE, WE ARE
REASONABLE, BUT WE ALSO WILL NOT
BE PUSHED AROUND.

RIPPLE EFFECT.

WORLD AND YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
A DISPUTE OVER ONE PARTICULAR
ISSUE POISON EVERYTHING.

FUND WARRANTED A GLOBAL MARKETS
MAY SUFFER IF THE G-7 STAYS
SPLIT ON TRADE AND SOME TRUMP
ALLIES IN WASHINGTON WORRY IS
NOT BEING SERVED WELL BY HIS
ECONOMIC ADVISOR PETER NAVARRO.
>> I THINK HE'S GETTING VERY BAD
ADVICE.
HE HAS A TRADE ADVISOR THAT IS
VERY PROTECTIONIST ORIENTED AND
FRANKLY WE DON'T NEED THAT.
>> THE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE SOME
SURPRISING ALLIES IN THE SENATE
WHO HAVE BEEN HELPING TALK UP
TARIFFS FOR MONTHS.
VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS TRYING TO
WIN REELECTION IN STATES FROM
CARRIE, PLACES LIKE OHIO AND
WEST VIRGINIA WHERE THESE
LAWMAKERS ARE BETTING THAT THIS
