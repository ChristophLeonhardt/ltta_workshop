1
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,967
THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHER, ONE

2
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:10,304
OF THE GREATEST THINKERS ABOUT

3
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:13,274
OF THE INTENT AUTHORITARIAN

4
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:14,108
TIZZY HIM SAID THE POLITICAL

5
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,743
LEFT ALWAYS GOES TO MOTIVE,

6
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:18,646
ALWAYS ARGUES THAT ITS

7
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:19,346
OPPONENTS ARE NOT JUST WRONG

8
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:19,713
BUT EVIL.

9
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:21,949
REMEMBER THAT, IT'S

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,684
IMPORTANT.

11
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:24,618
WE KEEP BEING TOLD THAT THE

12
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,352
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION PROCESS

13
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:25,953
HAS FURTHER INTENSIFIED

14
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:26,487
AMERICA'S POLITICAL

15
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:26,921
POLARIZATION.

16
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:30,558
FOR WHICH BLAME LIES ON BOTH

17
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:30,858
SIDES.

18
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,394
AS I SAID LAST WEEK, I CAN'T

19
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:34,328
STAND ARTISAN SHIP AND HOPE TO

20
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,665
BUILD ACROSS PARTY MOVEMENT

21
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,432
BEHIND THE IDEAS OF POSITIVE

22
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,534
POPULISM BUT RIGHT NOW AT THIS

23
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:41,335
MOMENT, ONE PARTY STANDS IN

24
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:42,436
THE WAY OF THAT WITH ITS

25
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:45,106
EXTREMISM, HATE AND RAGE.

26
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:45,940
NO IT IS NOT BOTH SITES.

27
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:46,974
IT IS ONE SIDE.

28
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:49,643
YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD A

29
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,145
REPUBLICAN LEADER TALK ABOUT

30
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:52,346
DEMOCRATS LIKE THIS.

31
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:56,350
>> HE HAS BEEN RACIST, HE HAS

32
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,419
BEEN SEXIST, HE'S BEEN

33
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,890
ISLAMOPHOBIC, HE HAS BEEN

34
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,258
ANTI- LGBTQ, THERE'S A LONG

35
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:05,259
LIST.

36
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,895
I DON'T THINK IT'S USEFUL TO

37
00:01:07,896 --> 00:01:08,996
SAY WE FIGURED IT OUT, THIS IS

38
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:12,233
WHAT HE IS, HE HAS A VIEW OF

39
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:15,703
AMERICA THAT IS INCREDIBLY

40
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:20,074
CONSTRICTIVE.

41
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:20,774
HE TALKED ABOUT AMERICA, HE

42
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:23,110
TALKS TO THEM ALL THE TIME,

43
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,111
AND IF BY NO MEANS THE

44
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:25,779
MAJORITY, AS WE KNOW, BUT IT

45
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,851
IS A VERY HARD-CORE ARE

46
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:34,021
RESPONDING TO HIM AND

47
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:34,688
SUPPORTING HIM.

48
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:35,189
>> STATUS AMERICA.

49
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,556
HONESTLY.

50
00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:37,391
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A REPUBLICAN

51
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:43,297
SENATOR SAY ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

52
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:44,165
>> PLEASE, GET UP IN THE FACE

53
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,535
OF SOME CONGRESSPEOPLE.

REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE EVER

DO THIS.

57
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:54,675
>> DO YOU SEE ANYBODY FROM

58
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:55,643
THAT CABINET IN A RESTAURANT

59
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:58,712

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,663
CONSERVATIVE?

IF NOT BOTH SIDES, IS ONE

69
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:20,434
SIDE.

70
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:21,368
IT'S ONE SIDE THAT STARTED THE

71
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:22,436
CYCLE OF HATE AND NO IT WAS

72
00:02:22,437 --> 00:02:23,704
NOT MITCH MCCONNELL BLOCKING

73
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:24,338
MAREK GARLAND.

74
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:25,072
HERE'S THE SENATOR WHO FIRST

75
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:27,241
STATED NO SUPREME COURT

76
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:28,008
JUSTICE SHOULD BE APPOINTED IN

77
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,711
A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR.

78
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:34,014
>> PRESIDENT BUSH SHOULD

79
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:34,582
CONSIDER FOLLOWING THE

80
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,017
PRACTICE OF A MAJORITY OF HIS

83
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:46,460
NOVEMBER ELECTION IS COMPLETED.

84
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:47,094
>> HERE'S THE SENATOR WHO

APPLY EQUALLY TO BOTH PARTIES

91
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,776
AND REPUBLICANS ARE IN POWER,

92
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:04,345
THESE CHANGES WILL APPLY TO

93
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:05,713
THEM JUST AS WELL SPREAD THAT

94
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:09,316
MR. PRESIDENT IS SIMPLE

95
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:09,984
FAIRNESS

00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:10,050
FAINESS

FAIRNSS

99
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:10,417
FAIRNESS.

100
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:10,951
>> SIMPLE FAIRNESS.

101
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:11,518
HERE'S THE SENATOR WHO

102
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,853
THROUGHOUT CENTURIES OF

103
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:15,823
BIPARTISAN ADVISING CONSENT

104
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:16,757
TRADITION AND VOWED TO BLOCK A

105
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:17,458
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE WITHIN

106
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,125
HOURS OF ITS ANNOUNCEMENT

107
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:20,828
BEFORE A SINGLE SECOND OF

108
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,495
TESTIMONY, BEFORE A SINGLE

109
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,530
CASE HAD BEEN REVIEWED.

110
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:24,231
>> I WILL OPPOSE HIM WITH

111
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:25,733
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.

112
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:30,504
>> AND NOW, WHO'S ESCALATING

113
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:31,171
THE ARMS RACE OF HATE.

114
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:32,106
LAST TIME I LOOKED, THIS MAN

115
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:32,873
WAS A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL

116
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:35,309
CANDIDATE, NOT A REPUBLICAN.

117
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,945
>> I BELIEVE OUR PARTY, THE

118
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:40,014
DEMOCRATIC PARTY MUST BE A

119
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:43,651
PARTY THAT FIGHTS FIRE WITH

120
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:43,951
FIRE.

121
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:48,689
WHEN THEY GO LOW I SAY WE HIT

122
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,089
HARDER.

123
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,992
>> SURE ENOUGH, THE LEFT ARE

124
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:52,693
NOW SAYING JUSTICE KAVANAUGH

125
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,328
MUST BE IMPEACHED OR THE

126
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,796
SUPREME COURT PACKED.

127
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:56,697
WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT LATER

128
00:03:56,698 --> 00:04:02,403
IN THE SHOW, BECAUSE HE'S TOO

129
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:03,170
POLITICAL BUT I DON'T REMEMBER

130
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:03,871
CONSERVATIVES CALLING FOR THE

131
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:04,571
IMPEACHMENT OF JUSTICE RUTH

132
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:08,809
BADER GINSBURG OVER THIS.

133
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,510
>> I CAN IMAGINE WHAT THIS

134
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:10,411
PLACE WOULD BE, I CAN IMAGINE

135
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:11,345
WHAT THE COUNTRY WOULD BE WITH

136
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:11,879
DONALD TRUMP IS OUR

137
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,246
PRESIDENT.

138
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:17,318
SAID THE JUSTICE COME OUT FOR

139
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,152
THE COUNTRY IT COULD BE FOUR

140
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:18,452
YEARS.

141
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:19,319
FOR THE COURT IT COULD BE, I

142
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,120
DON'T EVEN WANT TO CONTEMPLATE

143
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,420
THAT.

144
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:21,188
NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO MOVE

145
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,655
TO NEW ZEALAND.

146
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:24,558
AND IT'S NOT THAT SUPPOSED

147
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,192
AUTHORITARIAN, THAT GREAT

148
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:25,859
UNDERMINING OF DEMOCRATIC

149
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,097
NORMS DONALD TRUMP CALLING FOR

150
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:30,931
PACKING OF THE COURT, IT'S THE

151
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:31,298
DEMOCRATS.

152
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:32,066
YES WE ARE IN POLARIZED TIMES,

153
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,967
BUT NO IT IS NOT BOTH SIDES.

154
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:38,272
CONSERVATIVE ACADEMIC, HOWEVER

155
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:38,906
MUCH THEY DISAGREE WITH

156
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:39,573
LIBERALS SIMPLY DON'T TALK

157
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:40,274
LIKE THIS LEFT-WING PROFESSOR

158
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,243
AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY.

159
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:44,845
LOOK AT THIS COURSE OF

160
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:45,979
ENTITLED WHITE MEN JUSTIFYING

161
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,850
IT SERIAL RAPIST ENTITLEMENT.

162
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:53,654
ALL OF THEM DESERVE MISERABLE

163
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:54,388
DEPTHS WHILE FEMINIST LAUGH AS

164
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,592
THEY TAKE THEIR LAST GASP.

165
00:04:58,593 --> 00:04:58,892
BONUS.

166
00:04:58,893 --> 00:04:59,593
WE CASTRATE THEIR CORPSES AND

167
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:02,830
FEED THEM TO SWINE.

168
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,498
BY THE WAY, THAT'S NOT EVEN

169
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:05,499
REMARKABLE ANYMORE.

170
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,038
REMEMBER, KATHY GRIFFIN,

171
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,606
REMEMBER SNOOP DOGG, AND NOW,

172
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:15,409
A NEW LOW AS THE LOONY LEFT

173
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,710
DRAGS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

174
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:20,647
INTO THE GUTTER.

175
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:21,315
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS, WHO

176
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,218
OVER 21 YEARS IN THE SENATE

177
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,953
HAS SPONSORED 28 BILLS ON

178
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:28,455
SEXUAL VIOLENCE, WHO HAS BEEN

179
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,090
AN OUTSPOKEN CHAMPION FOR

180
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:31,658
WOMEN'S RIGHTS, WHO EVEN AS

181
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,061
SHE VOTED ON BRETT KAVANAUGH

182
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,396
SPOKE POWERFULLY ABOUT HER

183
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:36,063
HOPE THAT THE CONFIRMATION

184
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:36,964
PROCESS WOULD LEAD TO MORE

185
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,700
JUSTICE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT

186
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,969
VICTIMS THAN DECENT,

187
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,772
THOUGHTFUL, SINCERE WOMEN

188
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,940
WOULD DESCRIBED BY THE WOMEN'S

189
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:52,246
MARCH AS A RAPE APOLOGIST.

190
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:53,213
THE WOMEN'S MARCH IS NOT A

191
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:54,715
FRINGE ORGANIZATION.

192
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:55,416
IT'S ENDORSED BY COUNTLESS

193
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,650
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF

194
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:57,017
CONGRESS.

195
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,287
THEY OWN THAT.

196
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:00,954
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLOWED

197
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:05,959
THE POPULIST MOVEMENT TO BE

198
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,195
TAINTED BY THE NEO-NAZIS OF

199
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:08,862
CHARLOTTESVILLE, I SPOKE OUT

200
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:09,763
AGAINST IT ON THIS NETWORK, ON

201
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:10,130
THE SHOW.

202
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,998
WHERE ARE YOU KAMALA HARRIS,

203
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:15,402
CORY BOOKER AND ALL THE OTHER

204
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:17,971
SELF RIGHTEOUS HYPOCRITES WHO

205
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:22,476
CONSTANTLY LECTURE THE REST OF

206
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:22,743
US.

207
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:23,377
WILL YOU SPEAK OUT AGAINST

208
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:23,744
THIS HATE?

209
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:24,478
IF YOU DON'T CONDEMN IT YOU

210
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,712
ARE PART OF IT.

211
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:26,480
OF COURSE THEY WON'T CONDEMN

212
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,981
IT BECAUSE HATE IS THE LEFT'S

213
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:28,348
CURRENCY.

214
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,116
HATE IS THEIR ENERGY.

215
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:34,655
HATE IS THERE PATH TO POWER.

216
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:35,656
JUST AS HANER SAID, THE XENA

217
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:36,290
PHOBIA MEANS SUSPICION AND

218
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,858
HATRED OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

219
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:38,492
DIFFERENT, IT'S A VERY

220
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,528
DEFINITION OF THE MODERN

221
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:42,029
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

222
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,863
THEIR BRAND IS HATE AND IF

223
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:45,199
THEY WIN, IT WILL GET WORSE.

224
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,234
NOVEMBER IS COMING THEY

225
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:48,802
CHANTED ON THE STEPS OF THE

226
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:49,236
SUPREME COURT.

227
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,070
YES IT IS.

228
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:54,141
SO LET'S USE IT TO SHOW THE

229
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:57,578
DIVISIVE DESTRUCTIVE DEMOCRATS

230
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,779
THAT EXTREMISM, HATE AND RAGE

231
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,416
WILL NOT WIN IN AMERICA.

232
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,351
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF

233
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:08,121
THAT AT HILTON NEXT AND NEXT

234
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:08,522
REVOLUTION.

235
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:14,228
WHAT DO WE THINK ABOUT IT?

236
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:14,962
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

237
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:15,696
THIS UNIQUE GIFT WHERE HE

238
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:16,463
PUSHES PEOPLE TO THE POINT

239
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:17,464
WHERE THEY UNMASKED THEMSELVES

240
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:18,332
AND THEY SHOW WHO THEY REALLY

241
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:18,599
ARE.

242
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
I THINK WE SAW THAT WITH THE

243
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:20,934
LEFT, THERE IS NO LOW LOW

244
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:24,137
ENOUGH FOR THE LEFT, THEY WERE

245
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:25,539
PERFECTLY WILLING TO DESTROY

246
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,574
AN INNOCENT MAN IN THE NAME OF

247
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:32,813
POLITICS OR POLITICAL

248
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:33,514
RESTITUTION AND THERE WAS NO

249
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:33,914
LOW ENOUGH.

250
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:38,285
WE KNOW THEY WEAPONIZE THESE

251
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:38,852
BASELESS ALLEGATIONS.

252
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:39,586
WE KNOW SENATE DEMOCRATS WENT

253
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:47,694
OUT AND TRIED TO FIND ACCUSERS

254
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:48,462
ABOUT THE NEW YORKER PIECE

255
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:49,162
WHICH, MIND YOU, EVEN AFTER

256
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:49,897
INTERVIEWING SOMETHING LIKE 70

257
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:50,597
PEOPLE, NOT A SINGLE PERSON

258
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:52,633
CAME FORWARD TO CORROBORATE

259
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:53,233
DEBORAH RIMER'S STORY.

260
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:53,901
YET THE LEFT RAN WITH IT.

261
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:57,838
AND IT DIDN'T MATTER TO THEM.

262
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,505
PRESIDENT TRUMP DISTINCTLY

263
00:07:58,506 --> 00:07:59,406
SAID THIS THAT YOU DON'T GET A

264
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:01,174
MATCH TO AN ARSONIST AND YOU

265
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,577
DON'T GIVE POWER TO A

266
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:04,244
LEFT-WING ANGRY MOB PARODY

267
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:04,912
THING AMERICANS ARE SITTING

268
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:05,445
BACK RIGHT NOW AFTER

269
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:06,113
WITNESSING THIS PROCESS AND

270
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,648
REALIZING HOW DANGEROUS THE

271
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:13,720
LEFT REALLY IS.

272
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:14,388
>> AND HERE'S THE IMPORTANT

273
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:15,055
PART, WE AS CONSERVATIVES

274
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:15,789
ALWAYS TRY TO APPEAL TO THE

275
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,456
BETTER ANGELS OF DEMOCRATS.

276
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:17,190
WE PROBABLY HAVE A LOT TO

277
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:17,958
AGREE ON, WE JUST HAVE

278
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,659
DIFFERENT WAY TO GET THERE.

279
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,826
WERE DONE WITH THAT.

280
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:24,665
THESE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT

281
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,465
WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS COUNTRY,

282
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:25,933
THEY WANT POWER.

283
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,267
THEY WANT THIS PRESIDENT

284
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:27,968
IMPEACHED AND PUT IN PRISON.

285
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:33,640
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF SAYING

286
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,373
DEMOCRATS WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR

287
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:34,708
AMERICA.

288
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,107
THEY DON'T.

289
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:35,742
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE

290
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:38,879
AMERICA OF FREE SPEECH AND

291
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,515
FREE MARKET AND AGREE TO

292
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:41,881
DISAGREE.

293
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:42,616
THEY WANT POWER AND THEY WANT

294
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:43,182
TO DESTROY ANYONE WHO

295
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:43,749
DISAGREES WITH THEM.

296
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:44,451
THAT IS NOT A LIBERAL VALUE,

297
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:45,185
THAT OF THE LEFTIST VALUE.

298
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:45,852
THERE'S A DISTINCTION THERE

299
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:46,620
AND WE, AS A DECENT MINDED

300
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:49,556
PEOPLE HAVE TO KEEP THEM THE

301
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:51,458
MORAL HIGH GROUND.

302
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,426
>> I THINK IT'S FIGHTING BACK,

303
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:55,162
BUT LET'S REMEMBER, THE PARTY

304
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:55,896
ITSELF IS WHAT'S BEEN PUSHED

305
00:08:55,897 --> 00:09:01,969
SO FAR TO THE LEFT, ABANDONING

306
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,837
THE AVERAGE DEMOCRAT.

307
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,839
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SUBMIT.

308
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,308
IN FACT YOU ARE CORRECT.

309
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:11,244
THERE'S NOT TWO SIDES DOING

310
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:12,179
THIS BUT I CONTEND THE COUNTRY

311
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,046
ITSELF IS NOT DIVIDED.

312
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,782
YOU HAVE 200 PEOPLE FIGHTING

313
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:16,984
OUT FROM THE SUPREME COURT,

314
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:19,019
THAT IS NOT A MASS MOVEMENT.

315
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,456
AS WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS

316
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,223
SHOCKED, SO ARE WOMEN WHO

317
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:26,927
MIGHT BE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY BE

318
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:27,527
ARE NOW IDENTIFYING AS

319
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:28,261
INDEPENDENTS, LOOKING AT THAT

320
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:31,365
THINKING THIS IS NOT A REAL

321
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,766
ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT'S GOING

322
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,735
ON, AND BESIDES, THINGS ARE

323
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:36,069
GOING WELL, WHO ARE THESE

324
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,537
PEOPLE, AND THERE REPRESENTED

325
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:40,841
AND THEN LEADERSHIP.

326
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:41,642
THERE'S NO ONE IN LEADERSHIP

327
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:42,275
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

328
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:47,948
SAYING FORCEFULLY THIS IS

329
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:48,582
ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE THEY'VE

330
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,316
LOST CONTROL OF THAT DYNAMIC.

331
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:50,050
I ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE POLLS

332
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:53,954
THAT WE SEE, WE KNOW THE

333
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,723
ENTHUSIASM VOTES, IT WOULD BE

334
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:57,658
A MISTAKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE

335
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,291
DEMOCRATS ARE RESPONDING

336
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:01,895
POSITIVELY TO WHAT THIS IS AND

337
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:02,796
SO, IF I TELL MY RADIO

338
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:03,563
AUDIENCE AND I WOULD TELL

339
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:04,264
EVERYONE WATCHING THIS, HAVE

340
00:10:04,265 --> 00:00:00,000
FAITH IN YOUR NEIGHBOR.
