00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:19,775
ENCOURAGING FOR

9
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:20,543
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

10
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:21,577
KOREAN PENINSULA?

11
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:24,347

12
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:29,185
TOUGH TALK THAT LED TO THE

13
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:30,052

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,060
DIPLOMACY TO WORK.

00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,862
IN ORDER TO SEE DIPLOMACY TO

20
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:41,030
WORK THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF

21
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,298
THAT HAPPENED BEHIND THE

22
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:42,598
SCENE.

23
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:43,466
UNPACK WHY A MOMENT LIKE

24
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:45,067
THAT HAPPENED AND WHO

25
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,402
DESERVES THE CREDIT FOR IT.

26
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:47,803
WELL, YOU KNOW, TEAM, IT'S

27
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:48,771
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU THIS

00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:49,105
MORNING.

THIS IS THE 12TH GREAT LAKES

30
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:57,713
SINCE THE END OF THE KOREAN

31
00:00:57,713 --> 00:00:57,980
WAR.

32
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,081
FIRST TIME WE HAVE A

33
00:00:59,081 --> 00:00:59,982
PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION

34
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:02,018
THAT UNDERSTANDS HOW TO

35
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:02,918
SYNCHRONIZE THE ELEMENTS OF

36
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:04,453
NATIONAL POWER TO APPLY AS

37
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:06,155
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS IT A

38
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:07,089
MAXIMUM PRESSURE.

39
00:01:07,089 --> 00:01:09,358
SO YOU HAVE HAD DIPLOMATIC

40
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:09,925
PRESSURE.

41
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:10,593
INFORMATIONAL PRESSURE.

42
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:11,594
ALL THESE TWEETS, EVERYBODY

43
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:12,628
KIND OF LAUGHED OFF.

44
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:14,864
YOU KNOW,

45
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:15,898
YOU KNOW THAT GOT UNDER KIM

46
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:16,732
JONG UN'S SKIN.

47
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:17,867
HAVE YOU MILITARY PRESSURE

48
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,635
WHERE HAVE YOU THREE CARRIER

49
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:23,773
STRIKE GROUPS IN THE SEA OF

50
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:27,343
JAPAN AIR FORCE OF BOMBERS

51
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:29,311
ON GUAM AND 28,000 GROUND

52
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:30,513
FORCES ON THE KOREAN

53
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:30,880
PENINSULA.

54
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,749
THAT'S A VERY CREDIBLE

55
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:35,251
THREAT BEHIND THE DIPLOMACY,

56
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,385
BEHIND THE INFORMATION

57
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:36,752
CAMPAIGN.

58
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,421
AND THEN THE ECONOMIC

59
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:38,788
SANCTIONS.

60
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,723
AND SO THE SYNCHRONIZATION

61
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:42,892
OF THOSE FOUR PIECES HAVE

62
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:44,860
APPLIED SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE

63
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,262
TO KIM JONG UN.

64
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:47,196
AND, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT

65
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:49,765
WE DID IN SYRIA AND HOW WE

66
00:01:49,765 --> 00:01:53,102
HAVE DEFEATED ISIS, WHAT

67
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:53,836
HAVE YOU GOT IS A PRESIDENT

68
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,237
WHO HAS SAID WHAT IS HE

69
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:56,372
GOING TO DO AND HE DOES WHAT

70
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,174
HE SAYS.

71
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:01,710
AND SO IT IS NOT LOST ON KIM

72
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,144
JONG UN.

73
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:04,246
THE PRESIDENT UNLEASHED THE

74
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:06,382
MILITARY TO CRUSH ISIS.

75
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:08,250
THAT HE RESPONDED VERY

76
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,217
FORCEFULLY TWICE AGAINST

77
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:09,551
SYRIA.

78
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,787
AND HE SAYS HEY, BY THIS

79
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:13,222
SPRING, IF WE DON'T HAVE A

80
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:14,623
DEAL, THEN, YOU KNOW,

81
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:15,658
SOMETHING IS GOING TO GO

82
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:15,958
DOWN.

83
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,726
THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE HAVE

84
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:19,128
A PRESIDENT THAT IS REALLY

85
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,764
DOING WHAT HE SAYS.

86
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:22,631
ABBY: THESE IMAGES WE WERE

87
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,266
JUST SHOWING THE AUDIENCE

88
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,034
PRETTY I DIDN'T KNOW

89
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:25,401
CREDIBLE.

90
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:28,304
THINK ABOUT THE FIRST TIME

91
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:33,142
THE KIM DYNASTY STEPPED FOOT

92
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:34,176
ON SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIAL.

93
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:35,077
YOU LOOK AT KIM JONG UN

94
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:35,811
THERE HE IS SMILING.

95
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:36,545
HE SEEMS HAPPY.

96
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,281
HE SEEMS REALLY MOTIVATED TO

97
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:40,516
MAKE A CHANGE HERE.

98
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:41,650
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST

99
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,252
SIX MONTHS AND WHAT IS IN IT

100
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:43,853
FOR NORTH KOREA?

101
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:45,020
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A FEW

102
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,422
MONTHS AGO THAT HE SEEMED SO

103
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:48,924
ANGRY WITH THE WEST.

104
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:49,892
SALUTING OFF BALLISTIC

105
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:50,259
MISSILES.

106
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:50,993
IT WAS LIKE EVERY MORNING WE

107
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:52,161
WERE REPORTING ON ANOTHER

108
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:52,428
ONE.

109
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:53,462
WHY DOES HE SEEM SO HAPPY IN

110
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:53,996
THIS MOMENT?

111
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,698
>> ABBY, THAT'S A GREAT

112
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:56,031
INSIGHT.

113
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:57,933
I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING

114
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:58,868
HERE IS KIM JONG UN'S

115
00:02:58,868 --> 00:02:59,802
GRANDFATHER HAD A VISION

116
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:02,037
WHEN HE CAME TO POWER OF

117
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:02,471
SELF-RELIANCE.

118
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,106
AND SO HE FOCUSED ON

119
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:04,807
SELF-RELIANCE FOR NORTH

120
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:05,141
KOREA.

121
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,810
AND THEN KIM JONG UN'S

122
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,111
FATHER, KIM JONG IL HAD A

123
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:10,045
VISION OF A POWERFUL

124
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:10,412
MILITARY.

125
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:13,382
SO HE BUILT THIS MASSIVE

126
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:15,951
MILITARY WITH ARTILLERY AS A

127
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:17,052
FOUNDATIONAL PIECE OF IT.

128
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,020
WHEN KIM JONG UN CAME IN.

129
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,755
HE SAID I HAVE TWO VISIONS.

130
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,657
ONE IS FOR A NUCLEAR POWER

131
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:24,260
AND ONE IS FOR A STRONG

132
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,593
ECONOMY.

133
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,829
AND, PERHAPS, KIM JONG UN IS

134
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:36,105
PLAYING OFF THE NUCLEAR

135
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,173
PIECE SO HE CAN HAVE A

136
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:37,973
STRONGER ECONOMY.

137
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:39,508
SUCCESS HAS A THOUSAND

138
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:43,546
FATHERS AND FAILURE AND

139
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:43,879
ORPHAN.

140
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,115
YOU SEE THE LEFT GIVING

141
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:47,850
CREDIT TO KIM JONG UNITED

142
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,884
AUTO WORKERS UNION'S SISTER.

143
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:50,319
MAYBE SHE WENT TO THE

144
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,921
OLYMPICS AND WENT BACK THERE

145
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,822
HEY, IT'S PRETTY NICE DOWN

146
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:54,123
THERE.

147
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:54,657
THEY HAVE FOOD.

148
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:57,426
SO, YOU KNOW, SO FOR THAT

149
00:03:57,426 --> 00:00:00,000
MATTER, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IS
