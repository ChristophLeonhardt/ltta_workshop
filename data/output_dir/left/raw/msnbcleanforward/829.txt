POLITICAL CONSULTING AND LOBBYING.

42
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:12,205
LOBBYING. SO THEY WERE GETTING GUYS

43
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,606
SO THEY WERE GETTING GUYS ELECTED.

00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:19,846
THEY CREATED WHERE YOU GET PEOPLE ELECTED TO OFFICE, AND

50
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,248
PEOPLE ELECTED TO OFFICE, AND THEN YOU TURN AROUND AND LOBBY

51
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,850
THEN YOU TURN AROUND AND LOBBY THEM ON BEHALF OF YOUR CORPORATE

52
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:23,150
THEM ON BEHALF OF YOUR CORPORATE CLIENTS.

53
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:24,952
CLIENTS. THAT WAS INVENTION NUMBER ONE.

54
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:26,854
THAT WAS INVENTION NUMBER ONE. INVENTION NUMBER TWO WAS THAT

55
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:28,556
INVENTION NUMBER TWO WAS THAT THEY RAPIDLY EXPANDED THIS IDEA

56
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:30,758
THEY RAPIDLY EXPANDED THIS IDEA THAT THEY COULD BECOME

57
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:31,993
THAT THEY COULD BECOME ALL-PURPOSE FIRMS ON BEHALF OF

58
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:33,060
ALL-PURPOSE FIRMS ON BEHALF OF FOREIGN CLIENTS.

59
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:34,862
FOREIGN CLIENTS. SO THEY WERE DOING BOTH THEIR

60
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:35,930
SO THEY WERE DOING BOTH THEIR LOBBYING AT HOME IN D.C.

61
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,264
LOBBYING AT HOME IN D.C. THEN THEY WOULD GO BACK TO THEIR

62
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:40,134
THEN THEY WOULD GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTRIES AND THEY WOULD HELP

63
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:42,436
COUNTRIES AND THEY WOULD HELP THEM WIN ELECTIONS IN ORDER TO

64
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,237
THEM WIN ELECTIONS IN ORDER TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR POWER.

65

LEGITIMIZE THEIR POWER. >> WE HAVE YOU ON TODAY TO TRY

>> YEAH. >> THIS IS A GUY I’VE BEEN

70
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:54,982
>> THIS IS A GUY I’VE BEEN WONDERING WHY HE DIDN’T

71
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:58,085
WONDERING WHY HE DIDN’T COOPERATE SOONER, AND THERE HAD

72
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,453
COOPERATE SOONER, AND THERE HAD BEEN ONE THING HANGING OVER MY

73
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,488
BEEN ONE THING HANGING OVER MY HEAD, IS DOES HE FEAR THE

74
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:02,457
HEAD, IS DOES HE FEAR THE RUSSIANS MORE THAN HE FEARS THE

75
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,190
RUSSIANS MORE THAN HE FEARS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

76
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:04,024
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT’S BEEN YOUR SENSE?

77
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,393
WHAT’S BEEN YOUR SENSE? >> MY SENSE IS THIS A GUY WHO

78
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,195
>> MY SENSE IS THIS A GUY WHO THOUGHT HE COULD WIN.

79
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,397
THOUGHT HE COULD WIN. HE’S DONE AUDACIOUS THINGS

80
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:10,665
HE’S DONE AUDACIOUS THINGS THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER.

81
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,300
THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER. SO IN THE FIRST TRIAL, I WENT

82
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:12,600
SO IN THE FIRST TRIAL, I WENT THERE.

83
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,301
THERE. I WATCHED HIM.

84
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:14,836
I WATCHED HIM. I OBSERVED HIM.

85
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,904
I OBSERVED HIM. THERE WAS A SWAGGER TO HIM.

86
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,873
THERE WAS A SWAGGER TO HIM. >> HE HAD A GLINT, A GLEAM IN

87
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:19,407
>> HE HAD A GLINT, A GLEAM IN HIS EYE.

88
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:22,310
HIS EYE. >> YEAH, AND HE HIRED THIS ARMY

89
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:24,011
>> YEAH, AND HE HIRED THIS ARMY OF TOP-DRAWER LAWYERS, WHICH IS

90
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:24,578
OF TOP-DRAWER LAWYERS, WHICH IS WHAT HE DOES.

91
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,013
WHAT HE DOES. I THINK HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD

92
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:26,780
I THINK HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD TAKE ON THE JURY.

93
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:30,184
TAKE ON THE JURY. THE JURY WOULD BE LIKE VOTERS IN

94
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:31,185
THE JURY WOULD BE LIKE VOTERS IN MICHIGAN AND THAT HE WOULD BE

95
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,386
MICHIGAN AND THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO WIN THEM OVER.

96
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:33,921
ABLE TO WIN THEM OVER. AND WHEN THAT FAILED, WHEN HIS

97
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,790
AND WHEN THAT FAILED, WHEN HIS OWN POWERS DIDN’T CARRY HIM

98
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,925
OWN POWERS DIDN’T CARRY HIM THROUGH, I THINK HE STARTED TO

99
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:38,226
THROUGH, I THINK HE STARTED TO PANIC.

100
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,128
PANIC. AND WHEN YOU’RE ALONE IN A JAIL

101
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,397
AND WHEN YOU’RE ALONE IN A JAIL CELL AND YOU’RE STARING AT THE

102
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:43,631
CELL AND YOU’RE STARING AT THE ABYSS AND YOU’RE STARTING TO

103
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,565
ABYSS AND YOU’RE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT’S GOING TO

104
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,534
THINK ABOUT WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOUR WIFE AND KIDS.

105
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:47,435
HAPPEN TO YOUR WIFE AND KIDS. >> YEAH.

106
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:48,803
>> YEAH. >> AND IF THERE’S GOING TO BE

107
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:50,038
>> AND IF THERE’S GOING TO BE EVER A DAY WHEN YOU’RE GOING TO

108
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,040
EVER A DAY WHEN YOU’RE GOING TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN, YOU

109
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,242
SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN, YOU START TO RETHINK THINGS IN YOUR

110
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:54,542
START TO RETHINK THINGS IN YOUR HEAD.

111
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:56,511
HEAD. AND I THINK HE STARTED TO GET

112
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:56,845
AND I THINK HE STARTED TO GET SCARED.

113
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,546
SCARED. I’M NOT SURE HE’S SCARED ABOUT

114
00:02:58,548 --> 00:02:58,913
I’M NOT SURE HE’S SCARED ABOUT RUSSIANS.

115
00:02:58,948 --> 00:02:59,948
RUSSIANS. >> YOU THINK HE’S FINALLY --

116
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:01,316
>> YOU THINK HE’S FINALLY -- HE’S SCARED ABOUT SERVING TIME?

117
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,150
HE’S SCARED ABOUT SERVING TIME? >> YEAH.

118
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:04,252
>> YEAH. AND THE TIMING OF THIS WAS SO

119
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:04,586
AND THE TIMING OF THIS WAS SO AWKWARD.

120
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,154
AWKWARD. HE WAS HANGING ON FOR A

121
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,055
HE WAS HANGING ON FOR A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON AT A CERTAIN

122
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:07,355
PRESIDENTIAL PARDON AT A CERTAIN POINT.

123
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:08,590
POINT. >> IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS STILL

124
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:09,858
>> IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS STILL THERE TO BE HAD.

125
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:11,293
THERE TO BE HAD. THAT’S WHY I’M MILDLY SURPRISED

126
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:11,860
THAT’S WHY I’M MILDLY SURPRISED HE DID THIS.

127
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:14,262
HE DID THIS. >> BUT HE HAD TO MAKE CERTAIN

128
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:14,829
>> BUT HE HAD TO MAKE CERTAIN STRATEGIC CHOICES.

129
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,464
STRATEGIC CHOICES. IF HE WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH

130
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,666
IF HE WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS TRIAL, HE WAS GOING TO

131
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,235
WITH THIS TRIAL, HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND A TON OF MONEY,

132
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:22,037
HAVE TO SPEND A TON OF MONEY, AND HE’D HAVE TO COUNT ON THE

133
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:23,572
AND HE’D HAVE TO COUNT ON THE FACT DONALD TRUMP IS AN

134
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,239
FACT DONALD TRUMP IS AN UNRELIABLE CHARACTER.

135
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,674
UNRELIABLE CHARACTER. IF HE’S NOT GOING TO GIVE THE

136
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:26,341
IF HE’S NOT GOING TO GIVE THE PARDON NOW.

137
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:27,375
PARDON NOW. YOU GO THROUGH MIDTERM

138
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,009
YOU GO THROUGH MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

139
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:32,047
ELECTIONS. DEMOCRATS START TO INVESTIGATE.

140
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:34,182
DEMOCRATS START TO INVESTIGATE. >> WHAT IF THEY WON BOTH, DOES

141
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:35,984
>> WHAT IF THEY WON BOTH, DOES THAT MAKE A PARDON EVEN HARDER

142
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:36,651
THAT MAKE A PARDON EVEN HARDER FOR THE PRESIDENT?

143
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:37,085
FOR THE PRESIDENT? >> EXACTLY.

144
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,286
>> EXACTLY. WHAT DOES IT COMPOUND?

145
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,821
WHAT DOES IT COMPOUND? MAKE TRUMP AT A CERTAIN POINT

146
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,757
MAKE TRUMP AT A CERTAIN POINT BEGINS TO WORRY ABOUT

147
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:42,157
BEGINS TO WORRY ABOUT OBSTRUCTION.

148
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:43,892
OBSTRUCTION. SO IF YOU’RE JUST RUNNING

149
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,293
SO IF YOU’RE JUST RUNNING THROUGH MANAFORT’S HEAD, YOU

NOW. I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO BE

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,299
I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO BE BETTER IN THE FUTURE.

154

BETTER IN THE FUTURE. I DON’T KNOW WHAT I CAN COUNT

IMPACT. >> OF COURSE IT DOES.

168
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:07,816
>> OF COURSE IT DOES. HE WAS CLOSE TO HIS DAUGHTERS.

169
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:09,318
HE WAS CLOSE TO HIS DAUGHTERS. HE DID A LOT OF THINGS OVER THE

COURSE OF HIS LIFE TO MAKE THEM EXTREMELY ANGRY.

OF EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS A LOVING FATHER.

00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:19,194
FATHER. AND THEN TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN IS

176
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:21,229
AND THEN TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN IS JUST A PSYCHIC BLOW.

177
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:22,831
JUST A PSYCHIC BLOW. AND TO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL

NONE OF THIS STUFF. >> I THINK HE DOES TURN.

217
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,155
>> I THINK HE DOES TURN. IF HE’S LOCKED IN, HE’S LOCKED

IF HE’S LOCKED IN, HE’S LOCKED IN.

00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,296
THE PROSECUTORS. HE WASN’T STRAIGHT WITH THEM,

DERIPASKA HE HASN’T ACCOUNTED FOR.

275
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:54,685
FOR. BUT THE CRUCIAL THING TO LOOK AT

276
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,186
BUT THE CRUCIAL THING TO LOOK AT IS THERE WAS A SERIES OF

277
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:58,555
IS THERE WAS A SERIES OF LAWSUITS AND LEGAL FILINGS THAT

278
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,090
LAWSUITS AND LEGAL FILINGS THAT DERIPASKA WEIGHED IN AGAINST

279
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,359
DERIPASKA WEIGHED IN AGAINST MANAFORT WHERE HE ACCUSED

280
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:03,493
MANAFORT WHERE HE ACCUSED MANAFORT ESSENTIALLY OF TAKING

281
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:04,995
MANAFORT ESSENTIALLY OF TAKING THIS INVESTMENT THAT THEY’D MADE

282
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,030
THIS INVESTMENT THAT THEY’D MADE WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

283
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:09,500
WHERE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE INVESTING IN ASSETS IN UKRAINE

284
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,602
INVESTING IN ASSETS IN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA, AND MANAFORT JUST

285
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:12,269
AND RUSSIA, AND MANAFORT JUST SQUANDERED THEM.

286
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:14,371
SQUANDERED THEM. AND DERIPASKA COMES RIGHT OUT

287
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,106
AND DERIPASKA COMES RIGHT OUT AND SAYS ESSENTIALLY, YOU STOLE

288
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,673
AND SAYS ESSENTIALLY, YOU STOLE MY MONEY.

289
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,107
MY MONEY. >> RIGHT.

290
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,475
>> RIGHT. >> AND HE SAYS, WHEN I CAME TO

292
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:21,745
LOOK FOR IT, YOU DISAPPEARED. AND SO THAT’S THE NARRATIVE, AND

293
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,914
AND SO THAT’S THE NARRATIVE, AND IT GOES UP THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN.

294
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,616
IT GOES UP THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN. >> SO YOUR THEORY IS HE

295
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:26,517
>> SO YOUR THEORY IS HE OBVIOUSLY MUST HAVE DONE

296
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:28,919
OBVIOUSLY MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING FOR DERIPASKA TO REPAY

297
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,953
SOMETHING FOR DERIPASKA TO REPAY HIM IN SOME WAY?

298
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:31,722
HIM IN SOME WAY? >> WELL, IT’S NOT EVEN A THEORY

299
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:33,424
>> WELL, IT’S NOT EVEN A THEORY BECAUSE WE -- I MEAN IT’S A

300
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,892
BECAUSE WE -- I MEAN IT’S A THEORY, BUT WE HAVE SOME ACTUAL

301
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:35,392
THEORY, BUT WE HAVE SOME ACTUAL HARD EVIDENCE.

302
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:37,628
HARD EVIDENCE. >> THAT LEADS US TO THIS?

303
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:40,931
>> THAT LEADS US TO THIS? >> THAT IS AT LEAST SUGGESTIVE

304
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:42,833
>> THAT IS AT LEAST SUGGESTIVE WHERE MANAFORT WAS EENL-MAILING

305
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:46,070
WHERE MANAFORT WAS EENL-MAILING WITHES A AIDE AND SENDING ALL OF

00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:47,738
WITHES A AIDE AND SENDING ALL OF THE PRESS CLIPPINGS OF HIM

00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,175
GETTING THIS FANCY JOB WITH DONALD TRUMP TO OLEG DERIPASKA.

309
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,243
DONALD TRUMP TO OLEG DERIPASKA. AND IT WAS DONE IN THE HOPE OF,

310
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:57,014
AND IT WAS DONE IN THE HOPE OF, QUOTE, GETTING MADE WHOLE AGAIN

311
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:57,448
QUOTE, GETTING MADE WHOLE AGAIN WITH DERIPASKA.

312
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:58,249
WITH DERIPASKA. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

313
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,086
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT’S CLEAR THAT MANAFORT WAS

314
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,455
IT’S CLEAR THAT MANAFORT WAS PROPOSING CLUETHROUGH KILIMNIK T

315
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:11,062
PROPOSING CLUETHROUGH KILIMNIK T THEY GIVE

316
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:11,429
THEY GIVE DERIPASKA.

317
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:12,163
DERIPASKA. THAT’S THE OUTLINES OF THEORY,

318
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:12,964
THAT’S THE OUTLINES OF THEORY, BUT WE DON’T HAVE THE CONCRETE

319
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:15,666
BUT WE DON’T HAVE THE CONCRETE STUFF TO BACK IT UP WHERE THIS

320
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:16,367
STUFF TO BACK IT UP WHERE THIS COOPERATION MIGHT COME IN.

321
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:18,870
COOPERATION MIGHT COME IN. >> I HAVE TO PAUSE IT THERE.

322
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,605
>> I HAVE TO PAUSE IT THERE. I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY GO READ

323
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,572
I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY GO READ THE PIECE IN THE ATLANTIC.

324
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,674
