1
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:21,922
CORTEZ RSH  *, IS SHE ALL SIZZLE

2
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:23,257
AND NO SPEAK?

3
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:25,793
HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID WHEN

4
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:28,495
QUESTIONED ON

5
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,263
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN RELATIONS.

6
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,202
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

7
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:38,339
>> I THINK WAY MEANT IS LIKE THE

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,640
SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE INCREASING

9
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:44,612
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AND

10
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:46,714
PLACES WHERE PALESTINIANS ARE

11
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:48,582
EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY IN

12
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:52,386
ACCESS TO THEIR HOUSE AND HOMES.

13
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:54,688
>> DO YOU THINK YOU COULD POND

14
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,256
ON THAT.

15
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,558
>> I AM NOT THE EXPERT ON

16
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,327
GEOPOLITICS ON THIS ISSUE.

17
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,662
JESSE: THAT'S FOR SURE.

18
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:05,866
JOINING ME NOW, FOX NEWS

19
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:06,734
CONTRIBUTOR, TOMI LAHREN.

20
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,936
WE HAVE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE

21
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,537
I'M SURE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

22
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,139
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, BUT

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,508
WE ARE ABLE TO FIJT AND WING IT

24
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,610
AND PRETEND TO HAVE A SEMBLANCE

25
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:18,712
OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SUBJECT.

26
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:26,687
>> SHE IS ALSO RUNNING FOR

27
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:27,221
OFFICE.

28
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:29,356
SO THAT MAKES IT MORE

29
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:29,757
DISTURBING.

30
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:33,360
I USED TO LOVE IT WHEN HILLARY

31
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,262
CLINTON WOULD COME ON TV BECAUSE

32
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:37,131
I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE IT SO

33
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,571
BUT THIS IS MY NEW GIRL.

34
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,308
JESSE: I'M GOING TO DONATE TO

35
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:48,208
HER CAMPAIGN.

36
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,511
I WANT HER TO GO AS FAR AS

37
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:52,513
POSSIBLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC

38
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:56,383
TICKET.

39
00:01:56,384 --> 00:02:00,321
MAYBE SHE CAN BE BIDEN-CORTEZ.

40
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:02,523
>> SHE IS A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST

41
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:08,495
THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO

42
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,496
LOVE SOCIALISM.

43
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:14,368
WHY DON'T WE TAKE BERNIE SANDERS

44
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:15,669
AND ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ AND

45
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,204
DROP THEM INTO THE SOCIALIST

46
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:18,806
NATION OF THEIR CHOICE AND SEE

47
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:19,940
HOW LONG THEY LAST.

48
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:21,842
JESSE: I LOVE THAT IDEA.

49
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:23,744
I WILL CALL THE EXECUTIVES AT

50
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,979
FOX RIGHT NOW AND SEE IF WE CAN

51
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,982
GET THAT ROLLING.

52
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,185
LET'S HEAR WHAT HER OPINION WAS

53
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:32,920
ON DIRECT ACTION IN THE STREETS.

54
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:33,821
ROLL IT.

55
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,290
>> WE HAVE TO HAVE A RAPID

56
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:36,724
RESPONSE.

57
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:40,361
AND I THINK EVERY DAY WE GO ON,

58
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:41,795
ESPECIALLY A DAY WHEN SOMETHING

59
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:44,264
THAT HEINOUS HAPPENS, WE HAVE TO

60
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,366
OCCUPY ALL OF IT.

61
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,735
WE NEED TO OCCUPY EVERY AIRPORT

62
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,577
JESSE: SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

63
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:58,812
ABOUT THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION BUT

64
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:00,347
SHE WANTS TO OCCUPY EVERYTHING

65
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,115
IN AMERICA.

66
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:04,651
I DON'T THINK THIS TACTIC IS

67
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:05,285
EFFECTIVE, DO YOU?

68
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,522
>> IT GETS SOME PEOPLE RILED UP.

69
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,824
BUT SHE SAID SHE'LL TAKE A LOT

70
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,193
OF HER POLICY DIRECTION FROM

71
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:13,560
ACTIVISTS.

72
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,963
I HAVE A QUESTION, WHICH

73
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:18,298
ACTIVISTS IN THE ACTIVISTS THAT

74
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,300
RIOT, LOOT AND BURN THEIR LOCAL

75
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,403
BUSINESSES OTHER ACTIVISTS THAT

76
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:26,140
MARCH YOU ARE THE STREET WITH

77
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,908
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS ON THEIR

78
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:28,776
HEADS.

79
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:31,311
WHICH ACTIVISTS IS SHE GOING TO

80
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,880
TAKE DIRECTION FROM FOR HER

81
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:33,680
POLICY.

82
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,582
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF POLICY

83
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,150
EXPERIENCE.

84
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,452
THIS ISN'T HER STRONG SUIT.

85
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,687
WHERE IS SHE GOING TO GET IT

86
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:44,925
BERNIE'S HOUSE.

87
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,461
LET'S LISTEN TO HER TAKE ON

88
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:56,103
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

89
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,538
UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE

90
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,673
EVERYONE HAS TWO JOBS.

91
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:00,874
UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE

92
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,745
PEOPLE ARE WORKING 60, 70, 80

93
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,180
HOURS PER WEEK.

94
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:10,184
WHILE WE HAVE THIS NO HOLDS

95
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,152
BARRED WILD WEST HYPER

96
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,921
CAPITALISM MEANS PROFIT AT ANY

97
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,255
COST.

98
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:22,930
NOT ALWAYS EXIST IN THE WORLD.

99
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,873
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WORKS.

100
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,541
IT'S DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

101
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:34,875
WORKING.

102
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:38,145
I DON'T THINK SHE GETS IT.

103
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,746
>> SHE DOESN'T GET AT ALL.

104
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,751
MOUTH.

105
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,186
IT'S INTERESTING TO WATCH A

106
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:47,187
TRAIN WRECK.

107
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:49,957
SHE LOVES SOCIALISM SO MUCH SHE

108
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,525
DOESN'T THINK CAPITALISM IS

109
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:53,827
GOING TO BE AROUND FOREVER.

110
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,864
LET'S DROP HER IN VENEZUELA.

111
00:04:56,865 --> 00:05:00,100
LET'S GIVE HER SIX MONTHS IN

112
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,467
VENEZUELA.

113
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,769
JESSE: I WOULDN'T GIVE HER SIX

114
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,237
WEEKS.

115
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:06,974
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE REMINDS ME OF?

116
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,843
REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO DO THE

117
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,512
INTERVIEWS AND PEOPLE WERE

118
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:12,279
CLUELESS?

119
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,581
SHE REMINDS ME OF A GUEST ON.

120
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:18,619
CAPITALISM.

121
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,320
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

122
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,123
IT'S THE MOST OF REGULATED

123
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,858
ECONOMY OF ALL TIME.

124
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,527
TRUMP KIND OF SLASHED

125
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:27,694
REGULATIONS.

126
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,800
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

127
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,436
CAPITALISM IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO

128
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,408
SHE DOES DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

129
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,310
BUT I THINK WHAT SHE IS TRYING

130
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:47,114
TO DO IS THROW OUT FLASHY WORDS

131
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:48,715
LIKE SOCIALISM BECAUSE SHE

132
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,350
THINKS ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL

133
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,653
FLOCK TO HER BECAUSE THEY

134
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:53,620
FLOCKED TO BERNIE.

135
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,789
I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING

136
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,123
SMARTER.

137
00:05:56,124 --> 00:00:00,000
AT LEAST I WOULD HOPE SO.
