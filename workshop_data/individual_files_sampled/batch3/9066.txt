Tucker: SAME ONES US LECTURES ANTIRACISM SUMMIT. WE FOUND A AMAZING SERIES OF BLOG POSTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED NO MEDIA ATTENTION. THE PERSON WHO WROTE THEM LOOKS IN RETROSPECT LIKE A PROPHET CALLING FOR AMERICA FIRST POLICIES AT LEAST A DECADE BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP ENTERED POLITICS. IN THE DAYS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA. THE BLOGGER SUGGESTED BORDER PAID AMERICANS OUGHT TO REBUILD THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS. IN 2006, THE BLOGGER SAID THIS ABOUT HER TELEVISION VIEWING HABITS, QUOTE: I LOVE LOU DOBBS.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT SEEMED LIKE THE AUTHOR OF WHAT I JUST READ WAS JOY REID. THE NOW TOTALLY DOGMATIC RACE-BAITING MSNBC WEEKEND HOST. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNET ARCHIVE, JOY REID APPARENTLY POSTED THOSE VIEWS ON A NOW DEFUNCT BLACK HAWK BLOG A DECADE AGO. MSNBC WOULD FIRE HER RIGHT AWAY FOR THE CRIME OF INDEPENDENT THINKING. WE REPEATEDLY CONTACTED JOY REID'S LAWYER AT MSNBC FOR COMMENT AND NO ONE RESPONDED TO US. IT'S POSSIBLE REID WILL CLAIM TWEETS WERE WRITTEN BY HACKER. LAST TIME SHE GOT CAUGHT WITH BLOG POSTS. MAYBE SHE WILL DO THE UNEXPECTED AND ADMIT THAT THERE WAS A TIME BEFORE THE REVOLUTION CURRENTLY IN
