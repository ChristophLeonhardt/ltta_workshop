THE PRESENT MISSIVE COMES IN. LAURA: THANK YOU GILLIAN TURNER. ERIC: FOREIGNNESS MUST BRING IN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSULTING FIRM AMERICAN DEFENSE INTERNATIONAL. A FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE. GO BACK TO FREDERICK. MAIN .2 OF THE PUSHBACK ON THE POTENTIAL EVE OF A HISTORIC SENATE? AND A SURPRISE. I THINK IS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC LIKE KIM JONG-UN. HE IS PLAYING TO THE HOME TEAM. THIS IS DESIGNED FOR CONSUMPTION BY THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE AND AT THE SAME TIME HE SAID THIS, THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT ISSUED A STATEMENT TO THE PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE REASON THE SUMMIT IS TAKING PLACE IS BECAUSE KIM JONG-UN LOVES THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON. AND DON'T FORGET, WHERE DO WE HEAR THIS PHRASE, MAXIMUM PRESSURE? IT BEGAN WHEN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR FOR SOUTH KOREA WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE SUMMIT WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. HE THANKED PRESIDENT TRUMP ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT, SAYING HIS POLICY OF MAXIMUM PRESSURE WAS WORKING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR THE SANCTIONS WERE WORKING AND HE SAID WE HAVE GOT TO STAY TOUGH. KEEP THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE GOING ON AND UNTIL WE SEE THAT KIM JONG-UN WOUND, HIS WORDS MATCH HIS ACTIONS. WE DO NOT SEE KIM JONG-UN TODAY ATTACKING THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT FOR SAYING THAT. BY JUST THINKING THIS IS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC AND HE IS PLAYING TO THE HOME TEAM. FROM 1994 WE HAD AN AGREEMENT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION THAT DID NOT BASICALLY WORK. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, TOOK NORTH KOREA OFF OF THE STATE-SPONSORED TERRORIST LIST FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT HOPING TO GIVE THE CARROTS BUT YOU KNOW WE JUST GOT KICKED IN THE REAR END OVERTIME. WHAT HAS CHANGED NOW? YOU THINK THAT IT DIRECTLY IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND HIS RHETORIC? WHEN HE HAS SAID ABOUT "ROCKET MAN" AND THEIR NEED TO DESTROY NORTH KOREA? THAT SOME SAW AS BEING RESPONSIBLE? I THINK HE DID GET IN THE HEAD OF KIM JONG-UN. I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS ACTUALLY DEALT WITH THE NORTH KOREAN THREAT. THE PROBLEM IS, IN THE PAST WE HAVE HAD PRESIDENTS I BELIEVE IN BOTH PARTIES WHO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. THIS PRESIDENT HAS CONFLICT OF THE SITUATION AND HE HAS GOT SOME SANCTIONS THAT HAVE WORKED. I WILL TELL YOU, I THINK THE ONE THAT HAS PROBABLY HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT GETTING US TO THIS POINT, ONE SANCTIONING THE CHINESE COMPLIED WITH, THAT WAS SHUTTING OFF THE MONEY LAUNDERING THAT WAS TAKING PLACE WITH THE IRANIANS LAUNDERING MONEY THROUGH CHINESE BANKS TO HELP PAY FOR THE NORTH KOREAN BALLISTIC AND NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THAT CASH SUPPLY HAS STARTED TO DRY UP. I BELIEVE IRAN AND THE EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT THEY'VE OUTSOURCED OVER THE YEARS SO MUCH OF THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM TO NORTH KOREA. AND SO, THIS IS ONE OF THE SANCTIONS THAT EVEN OUR TREASURY DEPARTMENT HAS SAID THAT CHINA IS COMPLIANT WITH. OTHER CITY IN THE SANCTIONS AGAINST OFFICE 39 SUPPOSEDLY THE SECRET UNIT THAT PROVIDES A HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS AND MERCEDES-BENZ IS IN EVERYTHING. THAT IS DEFINITELY TAKING IMPACTED ALSO SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA, THEY HAD DEALS IN THE PAST BUT WHY IS THE POTENTIAL VISIT UPCOMING TO NORTH KOREA SOME SIGNIFICANT? WAS A BIG DEAL. THIS HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR SOME TIME. AS YOU POINT OUT, WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT SENIOR LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND SENIOR LEADERS NORTH KOREA LAST WEEK BASICALLY GAVE THE THUMBS UP AND ALLOWED FOR THIS VISIT TO GO FORWARD. DAVID BEASLEY IS NOT A UN DEMOCRAT. HE HAS BROUGHT REFORMS OF MONTHLY PROGRAM, HE IS ACTUALLY CALLED OUT EUROPEANS SAYING THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GET TOUGH WITH RADICAL ISLAM ESCROW USING THIS AS A RECRUITING TOOL. AND HERE IS WHAT, WHY I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE PRESENT STRENGTH TO PULL OFF A DEAL OF ALL DEALS. HE NEEDS AT GROUND TRUTH. HE NEEDS TO KNOW ALL OF THE CARDS. NOT ONLY WILL THE GOVERNOR BE THERE YOU HAVE EXPERTS FROM THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM. CERTAINLY THEY WILL SPEND HALF IF NOT MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR TIME IN THE FIELD TO SEE IS IT REALLY WORKING GETTIS THE PEOPLE STATE THIS SUMMER FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY RECOMMENDED TO THE UNITED NATIONS. I THINK HE'LL GET THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH AS TO WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON. ERIC: IT HAS BEEN SUCH A HORRIBLE SITUATION THERE. MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE SINCE BEEN STARVED TO DEATH. THANK YOU. YOU MUST NOT FORGET OTTO WARMBIER AND CAUSE TO PROSECUTE
