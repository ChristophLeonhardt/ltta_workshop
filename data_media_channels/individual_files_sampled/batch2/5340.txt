tonight Donald Trump faces mounting legal and political pressure a federal jury will take this weekend off before resuming these deliberations on the fate of his campaign manager Paul Manafort and Bob Muller now tonight recommending jail time for former Trump a george papadapolis that's on the legal side on the political side new warnings that Republicans not only trail Democrats by six points in polling over who could win the midterms but a blue wave could mark the effective end of the Trump presidency now that may be motivating for many liberal voters but Republican leaders are also mobilizing right now take this new video that's aiming to rile up conservative turnout by arguing this is now a war for the Trump presidency it comes from a new multi-million dollar campaign by former Trump campaign chair and advisers Steve Bannon returning from exile to help congressional Republicans whether they want his help or not now Bannon is as we all know one of the most controversial figures in US politics for many reasons but it can be hard to see what's happening in the midterms without seeing what he's up to people can't decide what to do about developments in our politics if what's happening is not exposed or not known or not confronted and while Bannon has played quite a big role in conservative politics he rarely goes on TV he's never taken questions from an MSNBC journalist on air and that changes tonight we are about to air my new interview with Bannen plus independent analysis adversarial reaction and fact-checking from our panel of journalists and political analysts who are with me live I want to be clear upfront this interview had no ground rules nothing off-limits we talked about bannon's project for the midterms his donors his policy record in the White House his political record from Roy Moore to Charlottesville we talked about the times up movement his view of James commis firing in the Malheur probe and we talked about why Muller views him as a witness to both the collusion and obstruction investigation that's going on right now Bannon also recounts the first time he and Muller ever spoke at the doorway to Donald Trump's Oval Office here is part of our discussion starting with the midterms let's start with the midterms if they were held today who do you think would win the house I think they're held today we'd have a tough time holding the house I really do I think it could be north of 25 maybe 30 seats maybe north of that they're people that are projecting today could be 45 or 50 seats I believe on by November 6th we're gonna win this I think all this takes is people on our side of the football focused on what has to happen this is up or down vote on President Trump you know this is this election is going to come as a referendum on him he permeates the entire political culture and I think those that are around him or telling him that hey it's okay to lose the house you can work with the Democrats and you can run against a Democratic House in 2020 it's bad advice we have a C for now and I've actually made a film that's very much focused on getting out the Trump the Trump based a deplorable z plus the blue-collar Democrats I think this the opposition party media and the Democrats did succeed in one thing I think they did get a do-over to 2016 and I think this is his first real life you said you are gonna save the Trump presidency in these midterms does he know that he needs you to save it well I don't think I don't think the quote was we're going to save them what we're trying to do is actually get this message focused the message is about President Trump it's about a referendum on President Trump to me it's an up or down vote I think the Democrats and particularly the grassroots Democrats are running as an impeachment campaign I think our side has to understand that you just can't run on tax cuts you have to run on the entire package of the Trump presidency they think impeachments on the ballot in November why absolutely because number one time steyr and the grassroots of the Democratic Party have put it on the ballot and so as Nancy Pelosi right now are when they say they're not talking about impeachment because they've looked at the crosstabs in the polling and they understand what we put in Pietschmann on the ballot that is a way to get all of the deployables out even if the congressmen in your district is a rhino that you have to come out to support President Trump look people on the Democratic Left you saw grassroots networks nation a couple weeks ago there are people in these districts in July in 90-degree heat going door-to-door the reason that going door-to-door is they're talking about the impeachment of President Trump and so all we're saying is that hey it's already on the ballot let's do it your new group is citizens the American Republic and say we're at war what does that really mean well the film says Trump at war I mean the film is about trying you know Trump's at war against the permit political class is your film yeah the film is my film it's a film called Trump at war and it shows you that Trump is against is at war with the permanent political class the opposition party media and basically he's that economic war with China and so I think that when you look at this film you see that President Trump is a disruptor in an innovator and you see that he is kind of kind of delivering on the promises he put forward to the American people that he's not into just managing the decline of the country but he's going to try to turn the country around us so that's what the film is I think I think it's a film that is focused on getting our base jacked up and our base out because if we don't get our base out on November 6 we're gonna have a very bad day at the polls and so it's very important that the Trump voter and the invisible Trump voter show up that like a presidential year it's very important what do you say to Republicans who say why should they take your help if you haven't backed winning candidates in the special elections thus far well I think I think I did the back winning candidate in the primary you know the Republican establishment in Alabama irori more specifically I mean Roy Moore would have won that election if Mitch McConnell and Shelby and these others hadn't turned against him and so I think we've got a very good feel for how to to how to win a very good feel how to turn people out you know I've been very involved in this since the Tea Party you know the tea party election of 2010 so I think we have a very good idea of how to make these films I had to get people out how can you blame Republicans in Washington for what happened out in Alabama didn't devote make up their mind well the Shelby came out on Sunday morning on national TV and said I'm not voting for more and more I'm doing it right in you know McConnell was the guy it's the Republican establishment that dumped all this stuff to the Washington Post that turned against him when their candidate got smoked in the primary so there's a Republican establishment that said from day one we're never gone and we're now he going to support we're way more they were already meeting to unseat worry more and not to seat him if he even won so that was the Republican establishment turning against and they were sending a signal they would rather even lose control the Senate then to allow disruptors in there how much money does your group have we've raised you know quite a bit of money I mean we've made a pretty impressive film we're gonna release the film we've got a 25-person staff we run a war room every day we do talking points we can message million dollars over five million dollars over ten million dollars I don't want to get put a specific name on number one is it fair to say you have right now between five and ten million dollar I think it's fair to say that we've got enough resources and even more resources pouring in from from donors and we're venturing to start a small donor program I've never by the way I've never had a problem getting resources you know whether it was with Breitbart or doing other things i voice had because I'm you're also very rich and you know a lot of rich people I've had I've had a pretty good run and I do know some my net worth individuals who is funding this group why is it's private donors just private donors just like in the Democratic Party and these some of these groups it's it's private donors why not tell people who they are well because I think that donors want to be private it's the law and they got the full right to do that if they want to come to go public or private if they want if they want to come forward if donors want to come forward they can't come forward does it include Wall Street people finance people hedge definitely includes hedge fund people yes I think you I think you would say there's clay that we are very much focused on where the China Hawk you know see for you know I'm very upfront about I think what the situation is with China and I would tend to think that there are people that back this that our China Hawks so for you it may be ideology for them they want to make money off what comes out of these elect their positions no no no I think it's because of their patriotism do they have it I don't think it's enough money in this they have an investment outcome though in terms of their positions and that they could benefit from no no no is there anyone you would really it's really it's really I think more about what they think the direction in the country is is there anyone you would not take money from well I would not take money from foreigners right and there's certain people and I'm pretty selective about it you know who I take money from I've always had good partners always had partners have been pretty happy so I'm pretty selective about who I take money from but I've never had I've never had a problem raising money I think you've seen particularly in Wall treat and others you see a lot of people have come from hardscrabble backgrounds or blue-collar backgrounds that see the that like this populism that like economic nationalism that kind of like the Trump the Trump program that are pretty supportive but your critics say that you talk a lot of smack about Wall Street but then you're funded by Wall Street your new group you're admitting individually you just told me it includes finance years and includes people with a position in China is what you just said no no people that understand our position in China the people that understand that working out of the China Hawk doesn't say they had a position in China why didn't you understand though is how do you take on Wall Street if you're funded by Wall Street well by the way individuals from walking some of the biggest guys on some of the biggest guys in Wall Street are kite quite anti the antics of all fruits been up to I came out of Wall Street I was at Goldman Sachs you kind of know what the game is just because just because you've made some money on Wall Street adjusting cigars you're currently in a hedge fund doesn't mean you don't know what the the practices of Wall Street are I think some of the in effect I think it's a it's been a great way for some people that are blue-collar that have come from blue-collar backgrounds to actually get to get ahead the main piece of economic legislation that has been passed in the Trump administration is the tax bill most of those benefits go to the very wealthy was that a mistake over a second the tax bill the central part of the tax bill was also the corporate tax bill was to make sure that we were competitive with Germany and China and if you look at manufacturing jobs coming back here it's part and parcel of this of the situation we're in with the tariffs the economic package in the tax package that was the central part of it so you look at manufacturing jobs not globally I'm talking about what happened here what happened here in manufacturing jobs coming back that's why you've got that's where you've got such economic growth in the country one of the reasons is the tax is the tax bill now I wasn't totally I didn't actually love some of the things on the on the on the personal income tax remember in wolf on Wall Street Journal reported in the Oval Office I fought for a 44 percent tax for people making over five million dollars I lost that fight but it's not that that can't be redressed sometime in the future when you see eighty-three percent going to the top one percent is that too much I think what's important is what's happening with corporate America is that corporate America is becoming more competitive and we're repatriating three trillion dollars of cash to come back here investor United States I think this about manufacturing jobs I think if you look at president Trump's overall economic agenda it's working and it's working for it's working for middle-class and working-class people you talk about populism yes the president went to Marlo go where membership is $200,000 and told people the tax bill meant quote you all just got a lot richer is that your populism look I think populism when you look at President Trump as an entire program okay this this tax cut was focused on industrial tax cut and a repatriation of cash it was to make the manufacturing side of this country stronger we had 100% you know right off of capital expenditure and period zero this was all about building rebuilding the manufacturing base and that is the type of pipe ilysm I'm talking about am I totally excited about every aspect of the of the tax bill not not that excited remember I was a big supporter of paul ryan's border adjustable tax and that didn't go anywhere so we went to plan B so and do I think this can get better over time absolutely but I think given the context and given the situation that's a very strong tax bill hey I'm already melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our youtube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
