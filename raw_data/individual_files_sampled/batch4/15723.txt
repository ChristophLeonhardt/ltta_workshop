there's something worse I think lurking at the bottom are arguably worse which is that written into the law now because of the Ontario Human Rights Commission's policies which are the policies that bill c16 will be interpreted in reference to which is exactly what the Wilfred Laurier administrators and faculty said by the way is the idea that the we now have a Dogma enshrined in the law that biological sex gender identity gender expression and sexual proclivity are to be regarded as functionally independent phenomena and they're not man that's just factually false there's nothing about it that isn't pure ideology and that's you know people have no sense yet about how dangerous this is but they will because one of the things that's happening is that the public education system is being corrupted along ideological lines far faster than the universities and for anyone that's interested in that and who thinks I might be overstating my case which I am NOT they can go online and read the the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario website where there plans to produce a social justice curriculum encompassing kindergarten to grade 8 are fully laid out explicitly laid out with the doctrine being that the purpose of the education system is to produce students with the social justice orientation and there are bending physics education and mathematics education and literate and English literature education everything to that fundamental ideological goal and that's absolutely it's it's well I think it'll destroy the public education system that's over the next five years because as parents wake up to what's being done and teachers as well many teachers oppose that but they're terrified to speak out against it is that parents are going to parents with any sense they're going to pull their kids out of the education system but what if you're too busy to do that what if you're both parents are working and they can't afford they don't have a no like you're right I think penny who are alert can but what if you I'm just gonna pull an example of the blue let's say you're an immigrant family both mom and dad are working you don't have a strong command of English and you say well this is the Canadian way I'm gonna submit to Authority I guess what I'm saying is some very woke parents might say whoa you were teaching my kids crazy stuff I'm gonna switch schools homeschool private school but all of those things even just switching schools is enormous time effort cost and and friction because the kids are going to miss their friends and so the idea that yes you will have some people fleeing but you will have many more who are trapped and I think you when you say destroy the public system I think a broken down decrepit public school system that doesn't actually teach math science history spelling but teaches politics they don't that's not a bug in their mind that is their desired oh absolutely yeah well as I said just people just have to read the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario website it's all laid out this isn't hypothetical that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
