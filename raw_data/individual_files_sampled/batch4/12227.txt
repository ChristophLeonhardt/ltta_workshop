this weekend NPR interviewed representative Adrian Smith Republican of Nebraska and as some a gotcha question is every American entitled to eat the segment was about cutting food stamps in NPR's agenda was clear show the Republicans don't care if Americans starve which is why they want to cut food stamps Smith answered well they nutrition obviously we know is very important and I would hope that we can look to it is essential it is a special this was not enough for the media who declared Smith had under head after all doesn't everyone have the right to food now imagine a land where there is a right to food housing and health care imagine that such rights were enshrined in the constitution of that land that would mean that everyone in the land could live free without the burden of worry over such basic resources right know the South African Constitution guarantees a right to all of these commodities in fact the Constitution even creates a legal duty for the government to help secure such commodities if there are some 11 million food insecure people in the country including 1.5 million children with chronic malnutrition and growth stunting life expectancy in South Africa is 57 years there are currently 12 million people in the country without adequate housing the population of South Africa is about 55 million people declaring a commodity a right it is obvious does not make that commodity materialize and it certainly doesn't make it materialize in the most efficient fashion markets make commodities materialize in the most efficient fashion in the United States 9 out of 10 Americans live above the global poverty standard 96 percent of poor parents say their children were never hungry in the past year according to scholars at the Heritage Foundation and a poor child is more likely to have a table TV a computer a widescreen plasma TV and Xbox or a TiVo in the home than to be hungry even the Department of Agriculture the government agency responsible for administration of food stamps upon which approximately 15% of Americans now rely admit that well under 6 percent of American households have to worry even about decreased calorie consumption we want to know what fills the gap for Americans when they're poor feeding America a private charity that receives 900 million dollars per year in food donations the vast bulk from private companies in fact there is a strong link between food stamps and obesity so is America worse off than South Africa despite our Constitution not mandating food is right of course not we're significantly better off because it turns out that using government to confiscate wealth from the very people who produce cheaper and more plentiful ends up exacerbating scarcity declaring things right it feels good when those rights come with forced redistribution ISM the things become less available so no you don't have a right from the government to food you have the freedom from government to live in a country or food is available in plenty and where your fellow Americans help pick you up when you are down I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show I hope everybody had a wonderful Memorial Day weekend I hope that you took a few minutes to pay honor and tribute to the men and women who have sacrificed their lives lay down their lives for the freedoms that we now enjoy obviously that's a sacrifice we can

wonderful and I also want to talk about the the breaking scandal maaan scandal of Jared Kushner and all of that but first I want to say thank you to our friends over at helix sleep our sponsors over

you so president Trump spent Memorial Day the way that the president is supposed to spend Memorial Day honoring the fallen so he went over to Arlington National Cemetery and there he gave what I thought was quite a wonderful speech and it is a market difference when when Trump talks about the military and I think this is why so many people resonate to trump and resonated to him during the general election when Trump talks about the military there's a marked warmth there this is a guy who likes the military this is a guy who has respect for the military it's somebody who sees the military as the leading edge of American power and American goodness and decency as opposed to President Obama who always seemed a bit discomforted with with the American military he always seemed like somebody who was uncomfortable with American military power somebody who is uncomfortable around soldiers and members of other members of military the same thing with Hillary Clinton who reportedly back in the 90s actually asked if there was a way that she could prevent people from wearing the uniform in the White House I was according to a couple of people who worked in the White House at the time Trump obviously has a lot of warmth or the military in that show died Memorial Day which is quite wonderful here was president from speaking yesterday about the sacrifice made and by the Fallen letters also pledged to tell the stories of Robert Chris Andrew and all of America's fallen warriors today and for the next 1,000 years and he spoke I thought in in really glowing terms out the military it was really quite wonderful he also marked his first Memorial Day as commander-in-chief by heading through the throngs of motorcycles participating in Rolling Thunder the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also was part of Rolling Thunder and he he delivered a tribute he called service members angel sent us by God he said to every gold star family god is with you and your loved ones are with him they died in war so that we could live in peace every time you see the Sun Rise over this blessed land please know that your brave sons and daughters pushed away the night and delivered for us for all of us that great and glorious dawn pretty good stuff and again this is one of the reasons I think why President Trump is I think this is why President humph is is there's a certain gut level Americanism that people people resonate to in Trump if the things about America that I think Trump doesn't understand but I think he does understand gut level patriotism there's a great picture of Trump hugging a six year old born in Christian Jacobs he's dressed like a Marine because his father who's a Marine Sergeant Christopher Jacobs was killed during a training accident in California in 2011 and the you won't see any of this on the news by the way the media refused to cover anything that Trump does that's unifying or nice and this was unifying and nice and good for President Trump for doing it the other I thought great tribute to the military came from an active do or a former active duty military guy was activated until five minutes ago General James Madison who of course is the Secretary of Defense he was asked over the weekend on one of the news shows about what keeps him awake at night now normally when members of the administration you know Obama Trump anybody else when they're asked what keeps them awake at night they talk about Russia they talk about Isis they talk about all the various threats in the world this is a stellar answer what keeps you awake at night nothing I keep other people awake at night and it's very pretty amazing pretty amazing I love that so basically it was him channeling Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad he is the one who knocks pretty spectacular stuff well here's the thing Trump has the capacity to unify he does if he would just you know pay attention to pay attention to policy if you just buckle down to patriotic rallies go out there there's why I think on his foreign trip he gained some points in the estimation of the American public because he didn't represent America badly he went out there and he was fine he was fine I mean there are a lot of people in the media who are very upset about him like pushing the the president of Estonia I guess out of the way or doing this kind of weird handshake with Emmanuel macron as the president of France but in essence Trump was fine abroad and the despite the media's best efforts to paint him as some sort of idiot who's going to make America love flourish and terrible on the world stage we'll talk about Europe's reaction to Trump in just a second because it's actually Europe that's being really stupid and we'll talk about that in a second but the point I'm making here is that Trump is still a president with potential at this point in time Bill Clinton had a lower approval rating than Donald Trump does so Trump still has the potential to turn this thing around in order for him to turn this thing found though he's going to need to start acting in ways that aren't vague what I mean by that is that the big controversy over the weekend was this controversy over Jared questioner Jared Kushner is of course from son-in-law Jared Kushner really has no business being part of the government I mean I'm sorry bricks folks but Jared Kushner is not qualified to be in government he spent no time at all in his life thinking about government thinking about governance he is a stop guys stock market Wall Street guy who happens to be married to the president's daughter and sudden he's in charge of Middle East peace the opioid crisis the infrastructure plan and all these other things Trump doesn't want to deal with again if Hillary Clinton's done the same thing with Chelsea's husband we'd all be saying this is ridiculous in every sense of the word Trump has given all this power to Jared and now Jarrod got Trump sort of in trouble because there are all these stories breaking over the weekend I want to deconstruct them and break them down because the media is making more of them than they are but Trump should still move on beyond Jared Kushner who is a New York leftist who has no business in government so here is what broke over the weekend on Thursday NBC News reported that Jared Kushner was subject of scrutiny in the FBI's ongoing Russian probe we talked about this on Thursday it makes no difference because again there's no element that says that he's actually guilty of anything at this point so so what okay so he's so they're looking at him not a big deal then on Friday the Washington Post drops a bombshell right they report that Kushner and the Russian ambassador circuitously Atkins slate has a good rundown of this they're real leftist but this is basically just straight reporting they reported that Kushner and Russian ambassador circuitously act discussed setting up a secret communications back channel between the Trump transition scene team and the Kremlin in December in March the White House said the two had met but the post sources say the FBI took an interest in what was discussed and then apparently right after that Kushner had a meeting with the head of a Russian Putin run bank basically right about the same time the detail in The Washington Post report that's damning is that they were setting up back channels lots of presidents set up back channels with other countries for negotiation purposes because they don't want every negotiation to be out in the open it's important you'll be able to pick up the phone and have talks with people but one of the more nefarious ones that should have drawn more scrutiny was in 2008 Barack Obama set up a back-channel with the Iranian government which really should have drawn scrutiny should have prevented him from being elected if we didn't have our heads up our butts but you know the back channels are certainly common in American politics the problem with this back channel is that according to the Washington Post and this is under dispute now Fox News said that it didn't really go down this way the New York Times said it couldn't confirm the Washington Post sticks by its reporting the White House has not denied this Kushner apparently asked the Russian ambassador kiss lyac if the back-channel could involve him walking over to the Russian embassy and speaking in person to kiss lyac and using basically methods of communication from the Russian embassy back to Vladimir Putin now that is actually suspicious so if that's true that's a problem why would you want to set up what is basically what they call a skiff which is a secure secure compartmentalized area where intelligence can't get in why would you do that from the Russian embassy why would you want to say that the Russian KGB the FSB why would you why wouldn't you want the effort why would you want to set the FSB could monitor your communications or the NSA could not that is suspicious and that's a problem but again that has not been confirmed and their suspicion that maybe the Russians are leaking that out there just to make trouble so we don't have confirmation on that it is notable the White House has not formally denied that yet then on Saturday reuters reported Kushner had made undisclosed contacts with Kiselyov between April and November of last year its sources said that to discuss terrorism and economic relations between the US and Russia on Sunday the New York Times reported that Kushner was among the voices pushing Trump to fire James Comey and Monday The New York Times reported that Kushner met in December with Putin associate Sergei Gourcuff who was the head of that Russian bank I was talking about subject to US sanctions in the interest of establishing a back-channel with the Kremlin that's a weird report also because Gourcuff is not a political actor he's actually just a financial actor so that's a very weird way of setting up a back-channel since the way the back-channel was set up that's a little bit suspicious and the fact that they didn't report any of these contacts in the first place which they could have done in confidential classified settings now the answer to this is basically one of two things one is they were setting up some sort of back-channel because they don't trust American intelligence not to leak that's quasi fair considering that American intelligence has been unbelievably leaky ever since Trump took office it's also a little bit suspicious again because the people at intelligence whatever you also you say about them David French make this point at least they take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution you can't say the same about the FSB if you're talking about people in the various beliefs in nefarious intent I go FSB before CIA but defense number one is that depends number two is just ignorance that Jared didn't know what he was doing he wanted to set up a secure back-channel where he couldn't be monitored and so he walked into the Russian embassy and wanted something done there and he proposed this kind of off the top of his head because you dum-dum that is possibility number two and possibility number three is that there's actual corruption going on so here's the way that's played out over the weekend James clapper the former head of the CIA under President Obama he he is said over and over and over he has no evidence of collusion between the Trump team and the Russians but he says a warning light was on regarding Russian collusion but just from a theoretical standpoint I will tell you that my dashboard warning light was clearly on and I think that was the case with all of us the intelligence community very concerned about the nature of these approaches to the Russians okay so that's the one that the left is Lee is leaning on the right is leaning on the fact he says he has no evidence of collusion both can be true you can be suspicious and you can also say there's no evidence as of yet General John Kelly is the head of the Department of Homeland Security and he said that no one should be worried about setting up these back channels everybody has back channels what's the big deal anyway that you can communicate with people particularly organizations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us is a good thing and again it comes back to whatever the communication is comes back into the government and shared across the government so it's it's a it's not a bad thing to have multiple communications lines to any government okay but then he was asked well how about using the Russian embassy and you didn't really have a great answer to that we'll get to some more reactions the kushner story and what I really think is going on in just second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at legacy box so as I say frequently preserving your memories is I think one of the most important things that

okay so meanwhile so basically the left is saying that Kushner is obviously colluding and the right is saying well no channels of communication have been a way of doing business for a long time Charles Krauthammer has a different take he says there's no reason to trust the story in the first place I mean what if it's the Russians who are leaking it just to make trouble well I want Lindsay here I don't trust the story the Russians are leaking it clearly on a channel they know we're going to pick up the Russians are masters of disinformation they already had Washington with its knickers in a twist over the Russia conspiracy this is an added twist somebody's going to get a hernia here I think I'll stop the metaphor if you would point but we have no idea if it's true let's say it is true isn't the problem here the accusation here that there was some collusion during the campaign with the Russians well everyone agrees if the story is true it occurred after the campaign during the transition so unless there's some nefarious connection here there's no connection to the what was alleged to have happened the campaign and lastly we've had back-channel connections with adversaries for generations Henry Kissinger had them with the Russians and the Chinese Hillary had a back-channel to establish the opening of negotiations with the Iranians in what ended up is the Iranian nuclear deal and Barack Obama with Cuba it's absolutely not yet and the negotiations with Canada occurred in secret in occurred in Canada in secret our negotiations with the Cubans this happens all the time I don't quite understand where's the crime other than it's another piece that has Russia and the headline Trump people in the headline and thus is supposed to be scandalous show me okay and I I agree with Krauthammer I don't see what scandalous about the story it's not really standing up to scrutiny over time however I do want to talk about why it is that Americans are drawing such divergent conclusions from the hate behavior of the Trump administration and how Trump can help cure that some of this is the media and the media are now we're going to let go of it but I'll talk about what Trump can do to get past this because it will dog him regardless of who you blame it's going to continue to dog him until we come to some sort of realistic conclusion on all of this so in order for
