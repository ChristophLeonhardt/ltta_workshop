the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report earlier this week which warned that unless we make unprecedented changes to the global economy the world could experience severe food shortages extreme weather conditions and the displacement of millions of people in just 20 years but with the United States under Donald Trump vowing to leave the Paris climate agreement rollback environmental regulations and increase fossil fuel usage is it even possible to avert the coming climate disaster joining me to discuss this is Gina McCarthy former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency the EPA under Barack Obama Gina thanks for joining me on upfront well it's great to be here Mary Thank You Gina the IPCC's dramatic report this week says we have just 12 years until 2030 to make unprecedented changes to prevent catastrophic climate chaos does that timeline from the IPCC surprised you did it shocked you well I think there were there was news here one was that no longer are we looking for a two-degree goal we're looking for a one point five degree goal that means is going to be steeper and hotter and have to be faster they're doing that because they're already seeing that we're experiencing some catastrophic problems already we cannot afford the luxury of thinking that we can keep emitting carbon pollution and to allow us to get to a two-degree world it's just not going to be sustainable but the other thing it did is it said that that we have the scientific knowledge we have the technical capacity and we have the financial capacity to be able to address this what we're essentially lacking is political will and that could stem from people not making the demands on our government and it can also I think provide us an opportunity now to speak with a bigger voice and a louder voice we need action now the IPCC report says quote there is no documented historic precedent for the scale of the action needed now to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and when you have a recent study showing that a hundred corporations just 100 corporations are responsible for 71% of the global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 that suggests that this is systemic that suggests that the economic system needs to be changed root and branch if we're going to stop climate chaos well the only thing I know that changes systems is demand from people more broadly and more loudly than we're demanding it today that's what I want to have happen I don't disagree with you in some ways if we can identify the major shifts and systems we need then we have ability to tackle it and you say you know the demands need to be made agreed but what are the demands for do you agree or do disagree with people like Naomi Klein the author and activist or Kevin Anderson deputy director of the Tyndall Center for climate change research in the UK who say that it's basically capitalism versus the planet right now well I don't you know that's that's even a broader systemic issue then I think we need to tackle today let's let's think about the fact that we have solutions on the table today that if we more broadly put those out and provide the right incentives we can make change happen I think the u.s. in a capitalistic society can find ways of generating market-based strategies that have the kind of broad impact that we need so I don't think it's the form of government it's the ability for people to speak to government demand leadership that is going to make solutions happen today and invest in the kind of solutions we need over the long term but the reality is the President of the United States right now is basically a climate change denier who thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax whose response to the IPCC report was to ask who drew it surely it's a disaster for anti climate change efforts that he's the president of the United States the country historically responsible for most carbon emissions at this moment in history look it you're not going to have me defending President Trump I know what he did in terms of announcing getting out of Paris was against the science it was against the law it was a a decision that didn't recognize our moral responsibility here but in the United States you can continue to make progress at the local level you can continue to make progress at the city level at the state at the regional level now do I think we're where we need to be I wish I did I know we're not but that doesn't mean that we're all gonna sit around and wait for President Trump to tell the rest of the world that the u.s. is not going to participate we are going to participate people are stepping up and we are going to do the best we can so you served under a previous leader your old boss President Obama did take climate change seriously and got plaudits for signing up the u.s. to the Paris climate agreement in 2015 rightly so some of his supporters say he'll be remembered at least in his second term if not his first as the climate president but it was also under Obama's watch that oil production rose at the fastest rate in the hundred and 50 year history of the US oil industry and he also presided over the highest US natural gas production levels in history well I mean clearly we didn't control everything because that's not actually what government has an ability to do but I think this president sent all the right signals about the importance of climate I think he he turned at least to a great record in the second half of his administration on actions to take is there more to do do we have to now deal with the fact that natural gas was one of the transition fuel or the bridge fuel that got us away from coal yes it is now do we have to deal with natural gas we sure do so the challenges remain but the fact that he provided leadership domestically in the US and internationally is undeniable in his personal commitment undeniable it was important for the world we say undeniable James Hansen who I'm sure you know the legendary former NASA scientist who brought climate change to the world's attention 30 years ago he says in an upcoming book that President Obama quote failed miserably on climate change and oversaw policies that were quote late ineffectual and partisan what do you say to him well I mean I think he's a great scientist but I think it's very hot always to get scientists to understand that there is a system in which policies get made in decisions get made I'm not denying the science but translating science into political will is a difficult thing and I believe we have failed to broaden the engagement to human beings to make them understand that it's not about polar bears it's not about ice sheets it's about them their family and our collective future when researchers from MIT in the University of Chicago came out in 2016 and said quote if the past 35 years is any guide the world is likely to be awash in fossil fuels for decades perhaps even centuries to come that's the reality isn't it and that's why it's hard to be optimistic when it comes to tackling this existential threat from climate change it's hard all of this is very difficult but you know I'm 64 years old the world is nowhere near what it used to be 35 years ago and it and it's going to be remarkably changed in the next 20 because that's what science is demanding and that's what we have to produce a low-carbon future as a future that's healthier that's safer where our national security is protected and where individuals can have the kind of clean air and water that they need to survive that's our only choice that's the future we need to run to not be afraid to embrace Gina McCarthy I hope you're right thanks for joining me on upfront it's great to be here Mary thank you that's our show upfront we'll be back next week you
