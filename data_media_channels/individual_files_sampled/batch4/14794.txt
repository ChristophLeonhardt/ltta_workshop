it's September 28 2018 and you're watching battleground Hey ladies gentlemen and the rest of you thanks so much for tuning in as you know our commander Ezra he's over in the UK covering a very important trial that I know you're following so you've got the dynamic duo filling in I'm David the man Lloyd Menzies and over in Alberta we have Sheila the she-devil gun Reid how you doing there Sheila I'm great I've never been called that before but I am gonna put that on a business card well there you go six figures a free consulting advice for you we should I you know right off the bat we did say the date and it's what happened on this day in history that is very important to Canadians from coast to coast you putting on the head no idea oh hey no idea Paul Henderson winning the Summit Series yeah in 1972 got that part of it how many people do you think got that at home oh you know what folks that's the first thing if that was important to you cuz you know I'm gonna give you a little history lesson here not a sporting lesson okay back then in the the dark old days of the Iron Curtain this wasn't an eight-game exhibition hockey series this was us versus them capitalism versus communism free enterprise versus whatever they call their system of economic communism in the Soviet Union it was something that you couldn't even script I mean the idea that you had an eight game series in which one game goes to a tie so it's a best-of-seven series and Canada comes back from daunting odds and wins would just I think it was 34 seconds left Paul Henderson scores and folks the shame of this the shame of the hockey community is that this man Paul Henderson who had people on their feet even people who weren't hockey fans screaming and cheering and slaying the USSR monster is still not in the Hockey Hall of Fame that shameful and I hope this horrible mistake has changed before mr. Henderson passes from this from this earth there that's my rant on hockey talk Sheila well I'm not discounting the historical importance of the event I just don't think a lot of people have it marked on their calendars the way you do you know what maybe so and it's not a you know a typical anniversary date of like the 25th anniversary the 50th history it's kind of you know just an odd random number but I'll tell you back in the day I think I was in grade six or great for maybe a smaller grade and school shut down Sheila for this game I mean it was during the afternoon hour on a weekday and they brought in these big black-and-white TVs and we sat there and that's how important it was and you know we we should never you know it can never be replicated again because you know the Soviet Union is gone and you have Russians playing in the NHL like anyone else so it's a very special time and we you know next time you're at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto folks well don't give them too much a hard time they're just working there but you know make sure the the people there know that you really think Paul Henderson should be in the Hockey Hall of Fame and I can tell you this Sheila I think one of the reasons he's being kept out is because after the summit series Paul Henderson became a devout Christian and his I guess even jealous someone has a prostitute ization or whatever you want to call it kind of robbed some people on the selection committee the wrong way that's what I was told by an insider in confidence and I think that's one of the reasons why he's not there and if that's true that's doubly shameful well David just to go back to your point about the schools closing down I think the schools closed down for you when Queen Victoria was in mourning and I just want to get you back on track so that you can tell everybody at home what exactly we're doing here and how this whole thing works okay well yes we'll take it from here because I usually control the computer but you know folks it's like you know Captain Kirk walks into the the bridge of the enterprise and his his chair is missing and lieutenant Uhura has it so you take over my friend okay so I don't know if normally I don't know who at home has tuned in in the past to watch Ezra do a much better job of hosting battle crab then David and I do but oh great someone has a super chat so what you can do is for a dollar ninety-nine five dollars whatever you want to give us you can have your super chat highlighted and we'll be forced to read it out whatever or answer whatever question you've asked us if it's five dollars or more it'll be pinned at the top so that everybody can see it for a while and it's how we sort of pay the bills around here it what keeps David in those beautiful bumblebee ties why books that's like I don't think you can even get a coffee at Starbucks for five bucks in a buck ninety-nine wow I mean you know even Dollarama has things on the Shelf that a three or four bucks so I mean come on it's not a lot of money and you know what if you if you come up to the plate like Sheila suggested and we raise a lot of money here Oh that'll go over big time with the boss big time when Ezra gets back here on Monday because he's watching things isn't he Sheila well he says he watches things you know what then we have a we have a Snooper chat it's from Nigel just let me scroll back up here it's from Nigel he gives us two pounds and what he says is free Jeremy Bamber UK thirty-three years caged unjustly Nigel I'm sorry I'm happy to have read out your super chat but it's pretty obscure for me out here on the windswept Canadian Prairie I'm sorry I don't really know the reference there unless David does David you're on the spot do you know that reference I can't say I do we do have a Welshman in the studio as one of our trained broadcast professionals he's nodding ho2 but you know what I'll do Nigel out of respect for your generous donation when we're off the air I'll look it up and I'll see if this is an issue worthy of campaigning about but III don't know the particulars of this case I'm sorry David do you know what our first topic that we had in mind to talk about is today I do indeed aside from Paul Henderson's magic goal of course senator Graham unleashes during Senate Judiciary Committee hearing now I think even as we speak this is a story in progress Sheila what do you make of this you know professor Ford I'm sorry just you know it's one of two ways either this happened as she says or it didn't happen as he says but I will say this from a legalistic point of view no corroboration no witnesses no evidence not the kind of case I want to take on as a lawyer what do you say the only corroboration that exists is from Cavanaugh even Ford's own witnesses are contradicting her version of events now I'm not saying that something didn't happen to mrs. Ford but I am absolutely convinced that Cavanaugh didn't do it to her um you know how couple weeks ago we really got into the weeds because we were talking about sex robots coming to a neighborhood near you like it was a very weird conversation I thought it was weird you were more concerned about the logistics of it all like how do they keep them clean which i think is pretty revealing germane to the point I think that's very important I I'm sorry okay folks I apologize I'm into hygiene anyways go ahead Sheila yeah anyways the more I watched these Cavanaugh hearings and the more I watched what they are doing to this pretty decent man by all all accounts all credible accounts say he's a decent man that's why there are sex robots like if men never want to have anything to do with us women ever again and turn to sex robots I will point to the Cavanaugh hearings as the tipping point and the reason why actually you know what Sheila on a more practical course I was having a conversation with lady mentor the other day and she is in Cavanaugh's camp and what she thought is how women are doing themselves a disservice by always saying that because it's a woman making these allegations we have to believe her she has to be telling the truth she is a survivor and what lady Manzo he told me and I never thought of it this way is that next time a company is hiring do we really want somebody that might be a potential troublemaker on staff ie a woman where it's always the benefit of the doubt going to her if it's a he-said she-said situation I think that is troubling I do too you know what I think we have a super chat about just this for ten dollars from turbo Jones love that name he says I know what happened both are right however Kavanaugh saw it as total horseplay thus absolutely no recollection of it because she keeps describing it as sexual which explains the laughter I'm gonna disagree I think that Kavanagh absolutely doesn't remember this because it absolutely didn't happen this guy took meticulous notes about his life even as a teenage boy and I have a 20 year old son just the idea that he would keep a calendar is beyond me but Kavanagh was so organized that he did you know but but that's not to say he could have selectively deleted things that were unsavory but but Sheila I think this raises the point of how far back in some person's life do we go I mean I think you I our audience think of yourself today in this day and age at your age in your position of society your position in whatever career path you are and what you were like in high school what you were like in elementary school the things you did the things you may have said I mean is this the new normal Sheila that anyone running for any kind of public office thus loose are gonna go down to the high school yearbook and comb through it for anything you know an off-color joke a joke you know I you know a remark that's not politically correct by today's standards is this the new normal I think it is but I think the left is going to be sorry that they asked for it you know for all intents and purposes Cavanaugh seems like a pretty moral upstanding guy but the left I mean for the better part of two decades now they've actually made all manner of perversion and behavior completely acceptable and so in 10 or 15 or 20 years when we're going back on the life events of a leftist appointee I think we're gonna find out some strange things that actually did happen you know what what an amazing thing though that came out of these Kavanagh hearings was this sort of coalescing of the sort of divided conservative movement in the United States there are never Trump errs full Trump errs and the sort of good Trump bad truck people who sort of go back day by day but they are all coalescing around these Cavanaugh hearings and I think we have an incredible clip from yesterday's hearing that I think mr. producer could bring up for us you are you aware that at 9:23 on the night of July the 9th the day you were nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump Senator Schumer said 23 minutes after your nomination I will oppose Judge Cavanaugh's nomination with everything I have I have a bipartisan and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same the stakes are simply too high for anything less well if you weren't aware of it you are now did you meet with Senator Dianne Feinstein on August 20th I did meet with center finest did you know that her staff had already recommended a lawyer to dr. Ford I did not know that did you know that her and her staff had this allergies allegations for over 20 days I did not know that at the time if you wanted an FBI investigation you could have come to us what you want to do is destroy this guy's life hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020 you said that not me you've got nothing to apologize for when you see soda mire and cake and tell them it Lindsey said all because I voted for them I would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy are you a gang rapist No I cannot imagine what you and your family be going through boy yeah oh sorry Sheila I was momentarily distracted by the attractive blonde sitting behind mr. Cavanaugh okay just for a second here can we talk about what we just saw there something I was unclear even existed and that is Lindsey Graham's balls where where did those come from like I love Lindsey Graham now and I can't even believe it yeah no that was a very impassioned speech and I think he nailed you know he really nailed it with that but you know what I here's the thing Sheila getting back to whether or not he's guilty and whatever happened decades ago we always talk about how the left loves the idea of diversity is our strength and we're Pro diversity but it's not about diversity of thought anymore because if you take a contrary view of the Cavanaugh you know case on gender lines suddenly you're ostracized and right here in Canada I mean we're we're an independent nation of the u.s. we have nothing to do with what's going on here there was a story there's three Calgary city councilors females that are now refusing to give interviews to the Calgary Herald because they ran an opinion piece in which the writer supported Kavanagh so basically their position is we believe that she's a survivor without any evidence mind you and therefore to put your you know support behind Kavanagh therefore you are invisible to us we did not give interviews and and thankfully the Calgary Herald is not apologizing or retracting but doing the right thing that they're gonna run opinion pieces that go the other way but what do you make of that Sheila the fact that three city councilors at Calgary City Hall simply because they're female are saying that a she's right and B if you disagree with that as a member of a media organization we now ban you as a media organization okay first things first I see a couple super chats and I promise you I think there's three that we've missed I promise you we'll get to them right away but in regards to these city councilors not giving interviews to the Calgary Herald you know and I'm the first to admit this about myself I'm highly motivated by spite it makes me a terrible Christian but probably a really good opinion journalist now it's funny because what's normally happening to us here at the rebel is now happening to the Calgary Herald they always tell me Sheila there's no such thing as a slippery slope but these people are sliding down the hill pretty fast straight past as point yeah and it's funny because these politicians will say to other politicians you shouldn't be talking to the rebel because they've expressed an opinion we don't agree with and the Calgary Herald normally agrees with them as a member of the mainstream media yeah yeah yeah you still you totally shouldn't talk to them to the rebel and now the Calgary Herald we're writing something politicians don't agree with is getting the rebel treatment so I guess the moral of the story is careful what you wish for because you just might get it so far Calgary Herald is not backing down on their editorial stance on this but I would not be surprised to see them waffle and apologize and take it back which I guess sets us apart from the Calgary Herald in the mainstream media because when people don't want to talk to us because we've expressed a completely valid and legitimate opinion we don't really care a hundred percent no that's an excellent point Sheila okay I want to get over to our super chats because space Dave 2000 was incredibly generous right off the hop today he said just jumped in do you believe the Liberals will win the next federal election or will they be defeated and are the Liberals just the NDP in disguise David um if I had to BET right now Sheila yes I think the Justin Trudeau liberals will be reelected I can't believe I'm saying that based on their record based on the scandals based on the numerous faux pause but the fact of the matter is Sheila based on their history to date the sheer conservatives should at least at least have a ten-point lead in the polls and if the polls are accurate and I agree there's an asterisk on that you know that and they might not be accurate here's the thing it's it's in Reverse the Trudeau liberals right now have about a ten-point lead based on the last poll I saw I think you were talking about the testicular fortitude of Lindsay this is a question I have about Mr Shearer too when if ever is he going to step up to the plate and you know show that he's more of a pitbull than a poodle and right now of course the complicating factor is mr. Bernier forming his own party which potentially splits the vote so as a Toronto Maple Leaf fan who learned a lesson the hard way for half a century about not betting with your heart but betting with your head if I had to put money on the election in 13 months I would take sadly the Justin Trudeau Liberals yeah and I will just add another caveat to that as conservatives we need a strong NDP and and we don't have that because we need a split on the progressive side for the vote and there could not possibly be a more inept leader of the NDP right now than jog meet Singh he's a flake he doesn't know the issues he doesn't even have a seat he's really not all that concerned about getting a seat he's hardly campaigning and he's basically leveled the NDP's ability to fundraise so I know it sounds odd as a conservative from Alberta cheering for a federal NDP but really we need a powerful NDP and we're not seeing it you know what Sheila on the subject of jug meat sing I am predicting well I'm not predicting but I'm saying it's in the realm of possibility that we might see in the federal NDP party what we saw in the interior PC party in January which is a palace coup when Patrick Brown was disposed of and I'm saying that for all the reasons you said and one reason that you forgot which is a huge reason since jug meat Singh has come into the federal NDP they've only raised about five million dollars that is pathetic to put that into perspective to run a good federal election campaign in Canada you need a war chest of at least sixty million dollars five million that is terrible there are so many NDP MPs right now that really have buyer's remorse and I'm telling you Thomas Mulcair is looking better and better by the day because I think you know with jug meat saying as they say in Alabama this dog don't hunt was it Alabama I think we had this conversation before was it another province or state that begins with a and ends with a please feel free to win hopefully as a super chat as a super chat actually we have another one so the next one is from primp o primp 0:08 gives us five smackers Canadian and they asked will the Democrats now focus their fo outrage at keith ellison that incident happened recently and there is actual medical evidence ah no i doubt it because there is they're not even they don't even hide the fact that there's a double standard anymore a Sheila no I mean this has been going on since the Clinton era this is part of the Democrat DNA now to basically completely ignore actual violent assaults and rape and even deaths let's talk about the Kennedys for a second deaths and attacks on women from within their own ranks because their politics are right while conflating either incidents that didn't happen at all or just you know awkward heterosexual male interactions with women as real actual sexual assault they're not going to talk about keith ellison they're going to point fingers oh we got some technical difficulty there the first consideration for the the parole board and and the prison management I think what happened there we saw briefly of Ralph Goodale which is a good a good Seng by the way I'll end your rent there sheila was saying not only did Bill Clinton get involved in an inappropriate relationship with a young lady let's not forget it happened at a workplace so there is an HR violation there too but hey nothing to see there here folks they're Democrats they're Clinton's let's move along but we saw briefly a clip I think our train broadcast professionals might be running it again it's of Ralph Goodale I mean you were talking about some individuals that are challenged when it comes to testicular fortitude well here's a guy that's challenged when it comes to his heart and his brain in terms of the story Stafford murderer Terry Lynn McClintock getting transferred from a prison to a native healing lodge in Saskatchewan which if you didn't know better you'd swear was a motel 6 I mean you know a comfy room a kitchenette children are there and by the way that's another funny thing a Sheila here's somebody in the slammer for murdering an 8 year old girl and you're going to put her in an environment where other inmates if we even call them that anymore they're more like guess I would say have their children isn't this kind of a catastrophe waiting to happen it absolutely is but for some of these people who you know they they come from you know struggling backgrounds it sure makes criminality look like the comfortable choice if you can end up in a healing lodge where there's no fences there's no gates there's not really any guards there's just you know it's more like dorm mothers as opposed to guards I mean and let's talk about McClintock here Tori Stafford's killer she was convicted because she pled guilty to an assault what that she committed while she was behind bars for Tori Sanford's murder just two years ago I mean this woman is not on a fast track to rehabilitation she's just a very successful scumbag who's figured out how to game the system from behind bars and in that clip that we very nearly showed of Ralph Goodale he calls McLintock s past actions like bad practices bad practices that's what he called the rape and murder and disposal of this little girl like she was garbage in a pile of rocks that's what he called what McClintock is doing bad practices a little girl 8 years old who was murdered bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer and speak and and and I'll talk about the the the the bad practices of Corrections Canada in the second Shelagh cuz our trained broadcast professional team says they have the clip in its entirety and they're gonna run it right now right well the the first consideration for the the parole board and and the prison management officials is is Public Safety to make sure the community is safe to make sure that the institutions are safe to make sure that the public is properly protected once they're satisfied of that then the issue is how can this life that has obviously gone in a very bad direction be best prepared or the eventual conclusion of the set of the of the sentence which will come sooner or later and are you are you going to make society safer by by developing the circumstances in which that life could be changed for the better or released cold turkey at the end of the sentence Ohio chances are gonna be released till twenty thirty one mr. godell that's a long way away getting into this so early well the the prison management officials have determined this is the best way to both rectify her bad practices in the past but also to keep the public safe bad practices Sheila whether or not you agree with this the system as we have right now in Canada is regardless of what your sentence is you can earn a reduction in your sentence or good behavior now Terry i'ma Terry Lynn McClintock was in a maximum-security facility she got transferred a while ago to a medium security facility got into a fight with another prisoner there in which she viciously beat her now I'm thinking that's the opposite of good behavior that should have been a ticket back to maximum security prison instead she's going to this motel 6 healing Lodge Sheila this does not compute there's another level of it not computing Global News to their credit in a rare and outstanding act of journalism from them they did a little bit of legwork into what it takes to get into these Healing lodges and as it turns out to get into an aboriginal healing lodge as part of your prison sentence you don't have to be Aboriginal you can self-identify as Aboriginal to get access to these aboriginal healing laws so like I said but it is just a scumbag qualify then right exactly so I don't know if McClintock is Aboriginal and I don't really care because there rock record says that she shouldn't be there but if she isn't she's figured out how to game the system and get herself on easy street and also she a lot we have in Canada and 2018 what I'm calling a race based justice system if you're Aboriginal you qualify for a different kind of sentencing from these healing lodges right now there's a big movement for a similar set of penalties for black offenders to be treated like aboriginals because of root causes and growing up in neighborhoods a tower over police I mean can you imagine so the iconic image of Lady Justice you know holding the scales in one hand and the sword of the other and she's blindfolded well the sword has been traded in for a pacifier and the blindfold is she's wearing x-ray glasses now Sheila always with the pop-culture references okay we have x-ray glasses is pop culture gave me a super chat it's from Lulu Bob's five dollars Canadian very generous of you thank you was there an issue in the UK with Ezra being investigated for contempt of court is this true hope not as we need him there in October in October for Tommy's next hearing do you know the details of this David I don't this might be some internet chatter I haven't spoken to his residency went over across the pond Sheila have you heard anything about this yourself yes I have you see David Ezra was yeah because well clear the boss likes me better so anyway when we Marshall Marshall Marshall down John know so what happened was when Ezra and Tommy were in the courthouse Ezra took a video from within the courthouse but not at any court type stuff no proceedings or anything like that he took a video with his cell phone out the window at the enormous crowd below and it was sort of like a nice touching moment with Tommy and to see all that support and the other journalists there tattled on Ezra like Ezra didn't realize that it was something wrong but they tattled on him and I think they tattled on him because they don't want to show those compelling images of the enormous support that Tommy has and I guess the secondary reason is whether or not you work for the state broadcaster the BBC in the UK you're always angling for that job same as Canada you know with the CBC or the BBC and so you better start acting and thinking like you work for the government and enforcing self-censorship and that's sort of what came out of that but being investigated no I don't think so but that is incredible Sheila I mean just think about it if anyone has any skin in the game regarding what Tommy is fighting for it should be the media the Free Press and for them to tattle on something like this you know it goes back full circle doesn't it to what we were talking about with Kavanagh and the Calgary Herald you know what guys be very careful what you wish for okay exactly now we have another super chat it's from Nigel it's two pounds what is she was favorite Chinese main meal I've never thought of that I'm not an exciting individual when it comes to dining I would say just white rice I guess like Oh someone's gonna call me racist I know David what's yours well you're very culturally insensitive i hearken back to one of the greatest Chinese military men of all time who they named the dish after I am of course talking about general Tao chicken and I'm sure if general Tao got into a fight I don't care if it's boxing mixed martial arts you name it with Colonel Sanders in terms of the chicken world you know title I'm putting everything I owe on general Tao yes general Tao chicken that's number one here we have a exciting we have another super chat from someone with a Russian first name Russian for his name YouTube for two dollars it says Trudeau should go Kavanagh is innocent yeah check on both points yes but here's the question she'll I don't think you weighed in when we're talking about or forgive me if I if I've already forgotten what is your inkling for October 2019 when we have a federal election presumably in terms of the outcome do you think that the Trudeau Liberals are back or are they being are we going to see regime change I am a pessimist I guess in that regard I would say that probably the Trudeau Liberals will get back in maybe minority the optimist in me sees a conservative minority with the People's Party of Canada being the kingmaker and controlling the agenda the way the Green Party controls the agenda being the kingmaker in British Columbia ideally for me that's the ideal scenario because we get to see some of Bernays really conservative free market ideas sort of setting the agenda and the sheer conservatives having to suck it up and make peace with Bernier to get the job done but I mean that's really in fairy tale land I see the Liberals getting back in yeah you know what I do too at this stage and III and pardon the pun I know this is like crying over spilt milk but the fact is you know this conservative party leadership going back to last May of 2017 went to 13 ballots and mr. Schurr got in with less than 2% over Maxine Bernie and as you've adroitly pointed out in previous commentaries it was several thousand dairy farmers that was the tipping point and I just wonder if things only tilted slightly the other way that Bernay was the leader of the Conservative Party I think we're singing a different tune that's my gut feeling complete hypothetical question unless somebody invents a time-space continuum machine that we could go back and reverse things but culture again oh by the way folks for all this abuse I get for being a nerd don't forget that Sheila here and ladyman Zoid after rebel live when we went to the Madison tavern you talk about nerds they were playing Pokemon though you know they'll make a cut a Pikachu right you know you're just one glove to catch a Pikachu yeah we love to very illusive she's hanging herself with their own words folks Sheila Webb playing Pokemon go in 2018 your one degree away from BroNYCon my friend I would love to go to BroNYCon because I would make all the hats that the Brits wanted yes I would love brony fun no me and Lady Men Zoid we spend a lot of time waiting around for husbands for kids for husbands again and so you know you flip open your Pokemon go and see what's what sort of Pokemon are kicking around and it's just like a time killer keeps me off Twitter or I guess I'd be on there all the time anyway we have another super chat like I'm feeling you're such a blabbermouth anyways from Paul oh eight again with five dollars Canadian talk about generous this is the second super chat it's the difference between justice and social justice justice is blind social justice sees everything through the lens of identity politics you know what I totally agree actually I think social justice warriors and the like thirteen neo-nazi LARPers that there are in all of North America do you really are the two sides of the same coin they judge people on their cultural background their social status their income really social justice is just racism by another name and you know what Shelagh indeed it is and I call it the racism of lowered expectations that because you are part of this group we can't possibly expect you to live up to the same benchmark as other people and therefore we're going to cut you some slack that's patronizing it's despicable and it should be done away with I agree it David we've got a hockey question for you from a Russian first name YouTube two dollars again for you to answer this question which is more than I would ever pay but this person has taken pity on you it says hello Canadian friends what does chirping mean David this is you chirping well the chirping chirping is not well isn't it isn't chirping just like to you know you know yell out you know or or something you like to do Shelagh nag yeah I never thought that was a hockey specific term though chirping I think that's I think that's where I hear it most uses like hockey or sports connotations you know at the faceoff and they'll chirp each other um and sir yeah that's chirping so that's sort of crap talking to use a more PC term giving up price you know your prize is spending an hour on the internet with me oh what an embarrassment of riches from lee stafford another super chat it's $2.99 in british pounds and it says thanks to the rebel for supporting tommy and you know what it's one of those things i'm really proud to say that we're doing that despite you know parting ways with tommy that we are principled enough to see when an injustice is happening and stand on the side of the right and I heard from Ezra last night when he called his favorite employee and he said that on the street he can't walk down the street people are just happy and grateful for all that he's done for Tommy and you know I want to thank Lee Stafford for that generous donation Sheila and you know folks you know I also want to give you know I'll call out to Ezra you know this is by no means a money-making exercise for us quite the contrary we have to fundraise both for Tommy's legal defense and every single penny goes towards that and of course it is not cheap to fly over to London not cheap to stay in London eat in London and we have to fundraise for that this is a principled stand and it's all about freedom of speech and again how shameful that the media the UK media that are based right there in London would rather this all go away or even worse spin this to make out Tommy to be some insidious character that he is not so thank you so much Azra it is such a great pleasure working for you you're still not as favorite David okay there's one from andis Ma's doll another super chat Candice this is very generous both your super chat and your words Candice says love your work Sheila go Alberta proud love the rebels support of Tommy Robinson well thank you I guess for me go ahead David interrupts me that's I'm sorry but like I heard rebel I heard Sheila I heard Ezra you know too you know paraphrase Chrystia Freeland what am I chopped liver here David there's only one person in the world that I would co-host with and it is you because that's the only person they asked me to co-host you see folks we have a groovy kind of love we do what is the next I got to keep this show moving interesting well something you suggest that it's a beauty it's distracted boyfriend meme is sexist like as if this is really what the nation the once great nation of Sweden has to worry about I'm wondering here that other train broadcast professionals are you know they Vernor already on this and let's see how we're gonna actually run the meme guys or oh it's not a video it's just a video David so I gotta prepare for these shots to be as you can see there is you know three very good-looking people but the young gentleman in the blue plaid shirt is looking at the woman in the red top as the presumably his girlfriend or wife in the blue top is giving him the proverbial stink eye and believe it or not this has got people certain people in an outrage they've gone to some you know correct never wrong Sheila it's a regulatory body but it is the ultimate definition thankfully by the way of a toothless tiger because they have no power to ban it and no power to fund the people producing it but what they can do is you know you know shake their finger and go now now that's very sexist how is that sexist you know here's the thing Sheila you know I'm telling you as a 100 percent heterosexual male I am hardwired by eons of evolution to you know turn my head to look at an attractive woman going by because that is what it's all about it's perpetuating the species it is to you know be I got the train broadcast professionals nodding at me but you know you guys do it too you know it and if I saw a woman like that in that red top yeah my head is gonna swivel around like it's a magnet you know clinging on to a piece of steel I gotta tell you I'm just honest I wish I weren't so but it is so and I'll tell you I I'll tell you why I wish it wasn't so when you're driving this is a cause for distraction it really is and I've had one or two close calls let me tell you by looking at a you know a busty pedestrian in a tank top and but you know hey evolution made me do a baby what can I tell you David you couldn't do any harm in that little electric abomination that you drive but I mean this is a government agency in Sweden determining that and just like a meme like a jokey meme that even princess dolly parton has used in the past determining that it's sexist I mean I guess like you say eons and eons of genetic predisposition to the propagation of the species now is somehow sexist and let's talk about what this is sexist about if it's sexist about anything it's that men can't control themselves on the street or that you would be like a buffoonish enough to swivel your head around when I know you guys are a little more clandestine when you're checking out other women instead of swiveling your head around like a big dumb goofball or at least I hope that's how you'd behave David but you know what she let me add something here do you think I may be by those who are complaining there's a certain amount of jealousy going on and I remember you know I once upon time I used to write for the trade magazine marketing mag that covered the advertising industry in Canada and the early 90s there was a swatch billboard campaign and it featured a you know a busty model which you know resulted in a petition and the words of the petition were hilarious which was to say not only are the models breasts big in the ad but they appear to be gravity defying oh my goodness we can't have big breasted woman with gravity defying mammaries on the on the billboards of toronto and i'm wondering maybe the people complaining about the ads maybe they kind of maybe wish they had large gravity-defying breasts just saying yeah they always look exactly how you think they'd love this Sweden like I was saying to you over email the whole country needs a mulligan they need to start from the beginning they have the very first feminist government or that's what they like to say sorry Trudeau Sweden beat you to it but they also have one of the highest instances of sexual assault in all of Europe and actually BBC did the legwork here and I just wrote down some quick notes again in a startling act of journalism from the BBC they actually looked at the police convict like the court conviction rates and they discovered that up to 50% of men convicted of rape and attempted rape in Sweden are foreign-born that was one mistake podcaster no no you can't say things like that Sheila you can't say things like that while this is happening like while actual sexual assaults are happening the Swedish government the Swedish feminist government has a whole like broadcast standards council policing memes on the internet for sexist connotations the whole country just started again Sheila correct me if I'm wrong but years ago weren't there Vikings sailing out of Sweden you know what the hell happened to that culture and and right now just for those stats that you've cited and the fact that there's no political will in Sweden whatsoever to stem this tide I think we are looking at specimen number one in all of Western Europe of a country committing cultural suicide due to political correctness I agree and look how far they've come like you said the Vikings let's go let's be a little more recent um they're the country of the Swedish bikini team Oh remember those it's like that's completely gone yes it doesn't exist anymore you know we have a couple super chats though so I know you could probably talk about the Swedish bikini team all day but Joyce Reeves gives us two doll Alerus Joyce I don't see a comment there I'd love to read your comment if you if you have one and I'll check for one I'll keep checking but you give us two dollars but no comment but thank you I appreciate that maybe she'll give a silent treatment Sheila what do you think about that maybe that's two dollars for you David you enjoy so bad for you it all goes into the Community Chest folks okay we have another one right under that from v6 and it's two dollars and 79 cents Canadian and they say is faith being untreated or unfairly treated in the race for mayor in Toronto David what do you think you know what I will say this again if the polls are correct and I'm and and maybe they are maybe they're not and faith is the number three candidate after John Tory and Jennifer Keyes Matt then I don't understand the idea of banning her from debate Sheila in which there are candidates that I can't even remember their name their tracking so low down the list you know just like a story I covered here for the rebel media do the provincial debates and you had NDP liberal progressive conservative and the Green Party but wait a minute there were the Trillium Party actually had an elected member of provincial Parliament Jack McClaren why did the Trillium Party get kicked to the curb and the Green Party that had nobody in in the legislature get a spot and basically it's the media party darlings that are deciding who gets an invite and they come up with all kinds of cockamamie rules and I think in in in relation to the provincial debates I think the benchmark should be as long as you have a at least one member of parliament then you get to debate which was not the case with the Greens it is now because the leader did win his seat in Guelph so if we're going you know it doesn't work on a seat system and municipal politics but if we're going by polling numbers if you have a cut-off top six top five top four well then I'd say yeah faith Goldie has to be there what do you think I agree and actually that brings me to our next Super chat question it's from st. Joan of Arc for $5.00 Canadian and she asks why aren't you behind faith Goldie with a principled stance she's getting shafted and even City News Toronto and CTV is covering it now and she's a rebel alumni I'll take exactly the same position of David as David does and I'll just put also one disclaimer I generally am not all that interested in Toronto municipal politics being a world away from it except in instances where bad ideas threatened to spill over and be my problem for example John Tory and his pursuit of a handgun ban across the entire country because he can't get his act together in Toronto and deal with gang violence there so I'm not paying that close attention to the municipal race in Toronto except where as it of me and every other law abiding gun owner in the entire country that being said I did see a video out from faith yesterday and I found it actually quite appalling what it looks like is she gave money to cp24 which is I guess like a Bell News subsidiary in Toronto and or Rogers I'm not sure Bell correct me if I'm wrong and really it doesn't even matter um but she gave them a cheque to run a campaign ad and they called her back a week or two weeks later it looks like and said sorry faith we're not running your campaign ad and I think that's in violation of CRTC regulations that every candidate should be able to have equal access to advertising now that doesn't mean that you get equal adverts advertising you get what you pay for but they can't turn down your ad because they disagree with you politically that's crazy and it looks like that's what's happening and faith actually had the good sense to record her phone call and published it and they couldn't give her a response as to why they were just giving her money back they kept saying over and over we're sorry we can't run your ad we're sorry we can't run your ad and I actually I started to feel bad for the guy who had to call her because it clearly wasn't his decision and he didn't know what the hell to do but that's outrageous weather and even faced political enemies should be at least outraged that this is an affront to democracy if she is indeed polling third if she's a candidate on the ballot she should be able to buy ads and it looks like she's getting the shaft in Toronto but Sheila one key thing you said and I'm not sure if you're a hundred percent sure of it you were saying that under CRTC rules they don't have the right to refuse candidates had during an election campaign is that correct or yeah that's I'm just gonna quickly google that so that we're all clear but that was sort of what the screen capture that because then you know this is like a gift of faith because this will get into the new cycle in that she's going after them for breaking election laws and first cp24 to you know put the clamps on freedom of speech this way maybe they should rebrand themselves to CC cp24 i was at cpp 24 what was the soviet union what did they put on their Jersey I get you know I'm trying to say CCP okay there you go something like that something that evokes the freedom and the liberties and the pursuit of justice of the old Soviet Union there you go there's 20 yeah and for some reason I can't Google search that for me because I'm hosting a show but video video she actually posted a screenshot of the CRTC advertising regulations so if that is accurate then it sure looks like cp24 is breaking the law that's the caveat I'll make if that is accurate then boy it sure looks that and like you say it's a gift to faith if you don't like her and you don't want her to make news then quit doing things that put her in the news like you know what people aren't maybe and maybe faith is smart and savvy enough and I wouldn't put it past her to know that have you ejected therefore make it a news I know that reminds me of Fela every year this happens you'll see for example a website like Ashley Madison this actually happened a few years ago this is a website that facilitates extramarital affairs amongst married people and they'll go to the NFL and say here's our you know five million dollar check we want to buy a 30-second spot on the Superbowl and the NFL which is there right says that doesn't run you know with our brand values the answer's no and then what you know Ashley Madison does as they send out a press release and they end up getting millions and millions of dollars of free advertising Oh always cognizant always knowing that they're you know that they're added was going to be rejected you know oh we more on that later our trained broadcast professional has the rule here we go can you see that Sheila no okay if a broadcaster sells advertising time to one candidate or party other candidates and parties must also be given the opportunity to buy commercial airtime from that same broadcaster well Sheila I'm not a lawyer but that looks it oded the rights to me yeah I mean that's pretty clear um and you know it seems as though faith knew the law and it looks like cp24 is counting on this visceral response of the left to think that the rules only apply to people they like and opinions they like and that's just not how the rule of law works in Canada well Sheila we are out of landing strip I'm afraid we have to bring this big Boeing 747 down and you know sign off so listen my friend I know you're out in farm country I think you got a harvest your cucumbers and rapeseed and all that sort of stuff so get on your boots and your here windbreaker and get on your tracker tractor and folks thank you so much for tuning in it's always a joy to host battleground when the big bossman is way as we'll be back next week you'll see them next Friday he'll have tons of stuff to say about the the Tommy trial in the meantime have yourself a great and safe weekend see ya yeah thanks you
