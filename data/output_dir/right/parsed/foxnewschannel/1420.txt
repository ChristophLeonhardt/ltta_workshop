LIZ.
ELIZABETH: ALL RIGHT, ELLISON
BARBER WITH THE LATEST.
LELAND: AS ELLISON JUST
MENTIONED, JOSHUA HOLT IS
EXPECTED TO BE BACK IN THE
UNITED STATES BY THIS EVENING
FOR A HOMECOMING THAT HAS BEEN A
BRYAN LLENAS WITH THE BACKGROUND
ON THIS STORY AND WHAT IS
FINALLY BRINGING JOSHUA HOME.
>> 26-YEAR-OLD JOSHUA HOLT AND
HIS WIFE ARE NOW FREE AFTER THEY
WERE IMPRISONED IN VENEZUELA ON
WEAPONS CHARGES FOR NEARLY TWO
YEARS.
BACK IN JUNE, 2016 HE WENT TO
VENEZUELA TO MARRY TAMARA, A
WOMAN HE MEANT ONLINE.
THEY WANTED TO SPEND A COUPLE OF
MONTHS IN VENEZUELA SO TAMARA
AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS COULD GET
VISAS AND MOVE TO THE U.S.
WERE ARRESTED IN AN APARTMENT
COMPLEX IN VENEZUELA.
THE HOLT FAMILY SAYS THAT
VENEZUELA AUTHORITIES FRAMED
THEM BRINGING IN A STOCKPILE OF
WEAPONS AND GRENADES AND PLACING
THEM INSIDE OF HIS WIFE'S
APARTMENTS.
THEY TOOK PHOTOS FOR EVIDENCE
AND ARRESTED THEM.
THEY WERE ACCUSED OF WEAPONS
CHARGES AND SPYING ON BEHALF OF
THE AMERICANS.
NOW, JUST LAST WEEK, HOLT
PLEADED FOR HELP IN A CELL PHONE
VIDEO MESSAGE SENT FROM INSIDE A
VENEZUELAN JAIL WHERE A RIOT HAD
BROKEN OUT.
>> I'M CALLING ON THE PEOPLE OF
AMERICA, I NEED YOUR HELP TO GET
ME OUT OF THIS PLACE.
I'VE BEEN BEGGING MY GOVERNMENT
FOR TWO YEARS AND NOW, MY LIFE
IS THREATENED.
HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO SUFFER
HERE?
>> HOLT AND HIS WIFE'S RELEASE
CAME AFTER TENNESSEE REPUBLICAN
SENATOR BOB CORKER, THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS
COMMITTEE, MET WITH VENEZUELA'S
EMBATTLED PRESIDENT NICOLAS
MADURO ON FRIDAY.
MADURO JUST WON REELECTION IN A
RIGGED ELECTION REJECTED BY MUCH
OF THE WORLD AND RECENTLY
EXPELLED AMERICA'S TOP AMERICAN
DIPLOMATE.
NOW, JOSHUA HOLT IS FROM UTAH
AND HIS SENATOR, ORRIN HATCH HAS
BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY FOR HIS
RELEASE.
IN A STATEMENT, HATCH SAID,
QUOTE, OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS
I'VE WORKED WITH TWO
PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS,
COUNTLESS DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS,
AMBASSADORS FROM ALL OVER THE
WORLD, A NETWORK OF CONTACTS IN
VENEZUELA AND PRESIDENT MADURO
HIMSELF, AND I COULD NOT BE MORE
HONORED TO REUNITE JOSH WITH HIS
SWEET, LONG SUFFERING FAMILY IN
RIVERTON.
NOW, HATCH THANKED CORKER FOR
HIS WORK ON THIS.
BOTH HOLT AND TAMMY AS SHE'S
KNOWN ARE EXPECTED TO ARRIVE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE AT 7:00 TONIGHT.
LELAND: WHAT A HOMECOMING IT
WILL BE.
WE HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE JOSHUA
HOLT'S MOTHER ON THE SHOW A
COUPLE OF TIMES, NO SENSE, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE LOVE
THAT EXISTED AND FIGHT TO BRING
