1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
On the 21st day of August, 2017,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the moon will slide between the Earth and the sun,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
painting a swath of darkness across North America.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Great American Eclipse.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
An exercise in cosmic geometry.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A reminder that we live on one sphere among many,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
all moving to the laws of Kepler, Newton and Einstein.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The moon's orbit around the Earth is slightly tilted,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
so the shadow of the new moon usually passes above or below us.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
About twice a year, the three bodies briefly align, 

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and the moon's long shadow cuts across our planet.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The day dies and is reborn.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
The sun is replaced by an inky hole, 

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,500
feathered with the pale corona, 

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
a million degrees hotter than the sun itself.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Staring up into the cone of blackness you can feel the cosmic gears grinding.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Two minutes of beauty and terror.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
But while most humans will be looking up,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
a few will be looking down.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For astronauts on the International Space Station, 

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
an eclipse is a shadowy stain on the planet.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A dark blur among swirling clouds.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Even farther above the Earth,

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
weather satellites keep pace with our spinning world,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
watching the moon's shadow slide from sunrise to sunset.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Other satellites look outward, 

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
staring up at our nearest star.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Their view of fire interrupted by the passing moon.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,500
From the moon's perspective,

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,500
the Earth never rises or sets.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It just wobbles back and forth in the sky.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
From its orbit around the moon,

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will look back at Earth 

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
to photograph our shadowed home.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A million miles away, the Dscovr spacecraft faces perpetual noon.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The spacecraft can watch the moon's dark face pass behind the globe

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,000
or slip across it.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A dull gray orb on a sphere of white and blue.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
From this far out, an eclipse is a passing shadow

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
after months of brilliant sunlight.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But the moon is not the only object moving between sun and Earth.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Winged Mercury has no moon of its own and no eclipses.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,500
But seen from Earth it crosses the sun about 13 times a century.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A tiny dot, slightly larger than our moon,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
backlit by fire.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Transits of Venus are much rarer. 

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
These images from 1882

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
were the last for over a century, 

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
until Venus returned to double-cross the sun

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
in 2004 and 2012.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our descendents will not see another transit of Venus

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
for a hundred years.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
The next one is in 2117.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Mars has two moons.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Phobos, the largest, is a potato-shaped rock only 16 miles long.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Martian rovers have looked up to capture Phobos passing in front of the sun.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A partial eclipse seen from the dried-out surface of another world.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Jupiter has so many moons

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
that the giant planet may have several eclipses at same time.

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,000
Three shadows, sliding at different speeds, falling on rippled cloud.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Beyond our solar system, astronomers have found thousands of planets 

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
by playing a game of shadows.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Looking for slight drops in starlight when a planet moves in front of its star.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Distant eclipses on alien worlds.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But is anyone out there to cry or cheer or shudder?

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Or see the shadows cast by our own lonely planet?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Or are we alone in the long night.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do the shadows and the spheres dance only for us?
