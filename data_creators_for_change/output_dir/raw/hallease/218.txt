13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,160
their natural section I found um castile

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,450
soap I think it's how you pronounce it

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,410

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,070
what I got dr. bronner's magic soaps and

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,829
it's pure castile soap with organic oils

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,539
really mild it's a really really mild

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,539
soap um it's technically not a shampoo

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,800
is just soap so you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,039
body's it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever I tried this</font>

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,170
huge first off and it's liquid legs is

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,720
liquid it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not um that was maybe ten</font>

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,210
bucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and not like after washing</font>

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,299
long time using it for the first time

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">washed it out with my hair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,299
everything just did it like a normal

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,390
shampoo and my hair felt really soft

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,860
because there's so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different oils</font>

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,409
in it like the moisture was back in and

33
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,259
folk lean so double whammy it's really

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,820
great if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't think that maybe</font>

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,350
baking soda isn't right for you because

36
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,970
it's just too socially weird for you

37
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,790
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ok but you don't want to use a</font>

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,710
shampoo because it's a little too rough

39
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,130
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say definitely try some</font>

40
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,500
castile soap they have a lavender one

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,159
they also had a eucalyptus 12 some more

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,479
great products for you to possibly think

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,600
