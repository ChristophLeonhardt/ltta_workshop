00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,900
Jeff thanks for being with us Exxon and

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,240
Texaco are betting obviously on natural

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,490
gas with their recent acquisitions but

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,500
smaller natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> gas related companies</font>

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,859
are also focusing on oil and expanding

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,150
their oil activities what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,710
dichotomy mean for the industry

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously there's going to be a lot of</font>

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,650
consolidation and the smaller companies

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,059
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go where the money is but what</font>

11
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,920
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately mean well I think</font>

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really a matter of getting every</font>

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,000
last bit of these fossil fuels that we

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,860
can and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way they're gonna be</font>

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,840
able to do this at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,079
consolidation you know the one thing we

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,550
get so excited about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these new</font>

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,840
natural gas finds and everyone's really

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
excited because finally you know natural

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">gas prices are going down and you know</font>

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,809
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this huge supply now but it's</font>

22
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,000
kind of it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dangerous to get too</font>

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,559
excited about these things because you

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,780
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to forget that you</font>

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,210
know fossil fuels we deplete fossil

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,619
fuels less they're gone they're gone or

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,119
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where the no no no</font>

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,850
longer economically viable to produce

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,380
and I think that's what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,150
happen natural gas I think it you know

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,540
in 10 years where we going to be you

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,970
know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our new buses and trucks</font>

33
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,619
in the future are going to run on a

34
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,630
natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> gas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so now you have a supply</font>

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,790
that was once you know really utilize

36
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,700
just for for you know for one purpose

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,009
now a sudden coming a transportation if

38
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,110
you want a large scale so we're going to

39
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,430
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the natural gas pretty fast</font>

40
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,250
so i would think regulations going to

41
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,210
slow that down at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I I don't</font>

42
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,540
know I think in some in some respects

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,130
you do need some kind of regulation

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,240
especially when it comes to the

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,399
environmental concerns i know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

46
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">new york there's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some issues of</font>

47
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,689
them are so it's not a Jewish absolutely

48
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,520
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's it's kind of like you</font>

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,170
have to weigh your options and be

50
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,759
realistic about it of course we need

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">every we need every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ounce of energy we</font>

52
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,270
can get I mean there's no doubt about

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and you know that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even people</font>

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,579
that are not big oil advocates are

55
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,390
saying yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that</font>

56
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're gonna have to drill offshore it's</font>

57
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,709
going to happen but you know again weigh

58
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:11,640
your options

59
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">or we're going to get how 10 years 15</font>

60
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,280
years of power<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one source but are</font>

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we willing to pollute our water</font>

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,200
to a point where we can no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

63
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,230
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same problem in in Alberta</font>

64
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,360
with tar sands operations I mean it's

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,770
completely destroying at the basket

66
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">River which millions of people rely on</font>

67
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,190
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fresh water so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

68
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,420
without regulation in place we're just

69
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> repeat some of the same</font>

70
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">mistakes we've made in the past so how</font>

71
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,020
expensive this oil need to get before

72
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,030
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of green or alternative</font>

73
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,330
energy can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-competitive why would</font>

74
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,220
we both subsidize the not<font color="#CCCCCC"> subsidized</font>

75
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,900
well I would argue authority it's

76
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,650
already competitive you know this idea

77
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,630
of renewables relying on subsidies to to

78
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,600
compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an illusion fossil fuels</font>

79
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,930
actually from 2002 and 2008 fossil fuel

80
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,750
subsidies came to I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven years 79</font>

81
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,400
billion dollars renewables got about

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,200
twenty nine billion dollars so the whole

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
idea you know renewable is only being

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,860
able to survive with subsidies is an

85
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,530
absolute illusion I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

86
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,910
it's unfortunate<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't hear more</font>

87
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,130
about that because it's it's it's an

88
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,250
issue that it's very easily forgotten in

89
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,400
Washington I when when when our

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">policymakers are standing up in front of</font>

91
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,930
Congress<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and there they're</font>

92
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">making their case for something I don't</font>

93
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,760
know if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't know or or they</font>

94
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,769
just prefer not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

95
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,570
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey you know how long are they</font>

96
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,280
going to be in office right do you see

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,900
more consolidation happening in this

98
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,380
sector in renewables in renewables<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

99
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,299
oil I mean it obviously you have to go

100
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,130
to where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is yeah I mean I</font>

101
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,780
think there's gonna be consolidation

102
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,760
across the board and energy as far as

103
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,140
renewables absolutely i mean i think

104
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one thing in 2010 i had zeroed out</font>

105
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,110
about this i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

106
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,690
grid activity all that stuff's going to

107
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,489
get consolidated it's all technology

108
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,720
there are only a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies that can</font>

109
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,850
really take us to the next level so

110
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,840
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a lot of these small</font>

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,920
private companies they're going to get

112
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,870
gobbled up real fast so the larger

113
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,459
companies I know Exxon has

114
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,769
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a clause where they can get out if</font>

115
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,350
it's over regulated you see that being

116
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">an issue would that be a huge detriment</font>

117
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,940
to natural gas and some of the at

118
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,590
smaller companies I think it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

119
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,300
they regulated I I personally don't

120
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,729
believe that that the government is

121
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,300
going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the water issue as as a</font>

122
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,630
problem I I suspect it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

123
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,099
real New York things that's a problem

124
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,470
yeah absolutely but even though it's a

125
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,610
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that they're going</font>

126
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to regulate it i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end of the</font>

127
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,090
day you know special<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest controls</font>

128
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,060
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean the reality is</font>

129
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,030
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very it's very very</font>

130
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,560
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight to fight that you</font>

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,849
know the big oil companies and the coal

132
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,199
companies and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an attack on</font>

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,580
them it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it is this how our</font>

134
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,070
system works and I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as an</font>

135
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,320
investor you have to be you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

136
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,909
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just be aware of these</font>

137
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,479
things right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so OPEC has a surplus 2010</font>

138
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,860
what does that mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the industry</font>

139
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,720
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe anything up</font>

140
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,569
excess there's no I mean there's you

141
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,169
know OPEC is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about as reliable as</font>

142
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,759
chinese drywall you know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,360
i don't believe anything they say

144
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,560
although everything they've said for the

145
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,990
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years have been a lie and you</font>

146
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,150
know and again if you start getting into

147
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole idea of all we have all this</font>

148
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,389
oil left I you know you can have as much

149
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,370
you want but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the tap is only so</font>

150
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,110
big and at some point you know

151
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,360
economically it's just it no longer

152
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,520
makes sense and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really I</font>

153
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,280
think that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue at hand so</font>

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:00:00,000
yeah don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe okay thanks day sure</font>
