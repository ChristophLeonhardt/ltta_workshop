conservative in Hollywood it's so rare I had to see it for myself Amanda had joins me for part 1 of my conversation with the Hollywood conservative alright everyone welcome to pure Hollywood I am with via man to head conservative columnist former top 40 music artist War Eagle for life founder of the Hollywood conservative she is literally from Hoover to Hollywood freaking best guest of Fox News and others the five-foot-four firecracker Amanda Head how's it going very well especially considering you gave me some extra inches seriously oh but I got that one down you must have my eye it's so funny you bring that up I have had to have my driver's license renewed I still have an Alabama driver's license that's why I refused to switch over to call me California and get a California driver's license but anyway I had to get my license renewed and since I've had it since then the previous time that I had had it removed her renewed I had a startling revelation that I'm actually five - and not five four yeah for some reason and I'm like partially dyslexic with numbers so I don't know if it was the fact that it was an even number or what but when my boyfriend and I started dating he asked me how tall I was because he was like I love her petite size he's like how tall are you I said I'm five four he's like no you're not like yes I am I swear I am I don't know what I'm more amazed about the fact that you've held on to the Alabama cause I'm from Tennessee I held on that for a while or the fact that when I google you one of the first things that come up is five four I have no idea what is more worried about the internet that's one that I'll just kind of let go it's fake news it's all fake news well it was really interesting for me when I did check out your website that you from Hoover to Hollywood because I actually went to school in Birmingham Alabama at Stanford University and I live in Hollywood so I think I know a little bit at least about you and where your head comes from you know in small parts but for people that may not know you haven't listened to in the past I've got a few questions I think would be a good get to know Amanda time if you're down for it alright alright so this is really important if you're trapped on a desert island which would you rather have okay two to two possible choices kale or fried okra fried okra duh easy Prius or Silverado Prius or what Prius or a Silverado Silverado for sure good again more difficult as we go on basis or exactly someone yelling I stand with her constantly or roll tide oh you know that actually shifted for me prior to going into politics it would have been roll tide I've always said growing up that I could never date a liberal or a Bama fan but I think that as far as my aversion for the two liberals have moved into first spot so I'm with her I think grates on my nerves more that would definitely be nails on a chalkboard alright would you really have a permanent soundtrack of 2017 Katy Perry or Green Day American Idiot Oh give me off that Island I guess Katy Perry that's a radical feminist or a radical male feminist wait which should I rather be stuck on an island with yeah a radical male feminist because I feel like I could maybe convince them like I could maybe bring them back to sanity listen women seem to be like really really stuck in their ways oh I feel like the soy boy be completely worthless but that's just me alright so would you rather stay on the island or get on a rescue boat with Bill Clinton rescue boat with Bill Clinton I yeah I can push him overboard it's fine what was Nick saving would it be a difference no I'll take Nick Saban I mean he's smaller than me so we're good oh yeah he's probably 5-1 we go check that one up on Google too little baby man I think I could have guessed at least all except the male feminists or the radical feminists so I do understand the Hoover values the Birmingham South all that good stuff and being in Hollywood I know how incredibly frustrating it is and I'm so glad for every all the success you've had with the conservative the Hollywood conservative even though it kind of seems like an oxymoron since I rarely see any conservatives in Hollywood but for those people that have not checked it out why did you get into it what's been going on and what are the plans for the future so it was kind of I guess it was kind of the perfect storm for me as you said in the intro I was in the music industry for a very long time I did my first musical when I was like nine and I've been singing ever since I moved out to LA after graduating from Auburn in 2006 go right into the music field at the point at which I left the music industry which was January of 2016 I was in a pop duo with another girl we had two songs that hit the Billboard mainstream top forward B and you know we toured the country we opened up for future its off myself plus so we we had you know a very tangible amount of success such that I was able to reconcile in my heart and my head being able to leave the industry and feeling like I didn't leave anything on the table I felt like I I was satisfied with how far I had come in the music industry and then a couple other extenuating circumstances one being the people who I worked with on the project we're just really crappy people and a lot of the people who I encountered in the music industry it's interesting you know you hear about how you know when you first moved to Hollywood and you start witnessing how cruddy people's character is in Hollywood it's ironic but because it's pretty mild compared to them with the monsters that you come in to count and come into contact with once you achieve success that's when the real monsters come out but because then they see a certain level of success that they can gain on and so once you have achieved a certain level of success that's when you really start seeing there were really awful people because they they want to leech off of you and things like that so last January it was the beginning of an election year you know we entering into primary season a few months out for that and I've always been a lifelong conservative I think I went through a little phase in college where I was like hmm why am i a Christian why am i conservative why do I believe these things and I read a lot of books I want to read a book some I read a lot of books on apologetics and in politics and and basically ended up exactly where I started so being a conservative in Hollywood you know under all of these music contracts there were three things that we couldn't talk about as a female pop artist you can't talk about boyfriends they don't wanna hear about your boyfriend you can't talk about religion and you can't talk about politics so after nine years of not being able to speak my mind in a professional setting I was like I'm done I can't I can't do this anymore you know my nickname is the mouth of the south because it is very very hard for me to keep my mouth shut when I disagree with someone but really yeah so so I left it but it's ironic because when I switched over into this career I mean I guess I I guess I did abide by the gag order in professional settings but apparently I didn't in my personal life but because I expected all of my friends when I switched from music to politics I expected off of him to just be completely shocked and when I told them they were like oh yeah that's perfect for you duh so apparently I wasn't that quiet about it when I was outside of outside of the music world but you know it it felt like it was the right time in my life to make a career move and I felt like you know to sound so cliche but I felt like my singing voice could be better used speaking for my you know our generation as Millennials you know Millennials you know I'm on the older end of Millennials but for the younger end of Millennials they're just complete idiots they have no idea what's going on in the world 41 percent of them think that socialism is a good idea so they all think that conservatives are old rich white dudes so I'm not old not yet anyway I'm certainly not rich and I'm not a dude so you know I wanted to shift the paradigm and shift the perception of what conservatives are and I felt like going into you know talk radio and things like that would be the best way do it and I claimed the domain the Hollywood conservative because I figured if it wasn't taken and I was right you're right yeah so and it started from that era started with a radio show and then it moved into doing some writing and then a spokesperson gig and now it's now it's writing radio and TV - so awesome yeah I really encourage everyone to go check it out follow all your twitter and instagram handles are fantastic and i'm a few too because i went to three universities in the southeast University of Florida University of Georgia and Sanford University and Birmingham and Sanford cos it's a private Christian University I it was just a stark difference between I'm sure what it was like at Auburn where every class I took in your orcid Georgia and Florida was just straight-up propaganda indoctrination like I can't it's hard to even explain it to people unless you go like I took English 101 101 English we only studied female african-american writers from the entire semester when I took broadcast communications we had to watch a documentary and they said don't look at this to a political lens the whole documentary was about how Fox News was evil and how it's just propaganda and it's all fake and it was like just look at it for like broadcast purposes really like what it's like every single class it was insane it's funny looking back on my career at Auburn I felt impressed upon by my professors regarding one ideology or the other you know in fact I was in the business school after I changed my major from music now music was a completely different story all of my professors although I I never really got any indication about their political leanings but I imagine they all were probably liberals my business professors a lot of them were kind of like good ol boys so I think that they possibly were conservative but the point is is I never really knew one way or the other which i think is extremely valuable and and you know speaks to the climate and the culture at Auburn which I think has pretty much remained the same but I recently reconnected with one of my voice coaches from Auburn and she she's been retired for years now and she said that you know there are a lot of liberal professors and she said you know 90% of the ones that I came into contact were liberal but I said interesting because I never knew that like I never I never realized that it awkward so I was very fortunate yeah I was very fortunate to have that experience in in higher learning professors after Obama won the election that literally would do like a standing ovation in class how he's proud of everybody it was absolutely ridiculous but yeah I'm glad I'm glad there's still some universities that at least like you said they didn't impress it even though that was their belief which is totally fine everyone can you know book any way they want or whatever but um now that was great and I do I love what you said to you about starting to question those things like Christianity why I'm voting this certain way because I always encourage people that these are great opportunities when that happens you can fall back and reinforce why you believe that you can no not just walking out in faith or this feels right to do this but know why and I had that kind of revelation like two years ago to when we started to get into the the political cycle and living in LA I literally thought like maybe I'm just maybe two plus two equals five and I'm just been wrong my entire life and I the Y's are the most important part you know it's not when did you become a conservative you know who influenced you it is truly the Y and there are many many reasons why I'm conservative but at the end of the day when someone says why are you conservative my general answer is so that you can be liberal because liberals take the risks conservatives hold down the shop so quite literally in in a broader sense the reason that we have conservatives is so that people can be liberal because we're the ones who clean up the mess no it is very true it's just it's almost like I compare it to parenting where it's they say that conservatives don't love but sometimes the hardest thing to do is to tell your child no or take this away or punish and when it's not gonna be okay because you just give them what they want their entire life they're gonna be a ruined human being like and that's it's just I think it's the two other sides of it's like oh conservers not compact is like no this is the right this would be better for you in the long run I promise like yeah I think a single parenting book out there that would argue that tough love is not a great way to go and that's how conservatives our conservatives are the tough love people yeah exactly I think was really into and you're talking about your career in music as you said your friends were okay like they they knew your opinion we're fine about it but you kind of toe a party line I know that had to be crazy because for me my transition into Hollywood and entertainment was through Christian films which is a much softer segue it's entertainment before I got out here so was it more for you so your friends you said we're great which is I think it's tremendous that you've got support like that but was it more the frustration toeing the party line in the and if you did step out kind of the repercussions from the higher up so thought it was um no like okay so for instance when I first moved to LA I was ghost writing for an R&B and hip hop label hmm um one of whom was not this was in 2007 and so I was in the studio with NAS and we didn't really talk about politics I can only assume what his ideology is but um they knew where I stood and I don't know if this is because of my personality you know I tend to be kind of a Mighty Mouse I make my presence known and if you if you want to step up to me and have a conversation and and Duke it out I'll be happy to engage but they knew where I came from and I think for a lot of them it was it was more an issue of you know it I'm I'm not gonna fan that flame and they saw me as kind of like a you know a ticking time bomb and so um in fact I think Hans might have been the one who started calling me Mighty Mouse but the people who have given me the most pushback our liberal friends and I've only actually only lost one liberal friend and I do air quotes because she used to cut my hair and she charged me an arm and a leg even though she said it was like a friend right and she's kind of like your typical pink cat ear wearing feminists who when she found out I was from Alabama she was like everybody from Alabama's racists I'm like that's interesting because when I moved to LA people here are far more racist my hairs the guys they cut my hair to the exact same thing when I told my I'm from Nashville Tennessee yeah but you know my my best friend in the world is a black liberal he's been my best friend since I moved to LA 11 years ago and he and I can have conversations about left and right issues we're still friends you know I mean will Duke it out over it and but we don't he doesn't call me ignorant I don't call him lazy you know anything like that it's it's it's amicable conversation and I find that when you're face to face with someone who has an opposing opinion that's very often the case you know I and and I am 100% guilty of flame-throwing on Twitter I think in fact my last tweet this morning just to give you an example I I'm so guilty of doing this on Twitter and on social media and you do it online but when you come face to face with that person on the other side it becomes much harder to be so harsh and to call them name so my last tweet was liberals are like slinkys they're utterly useless but it's still fun to throw them down the stairs huh looks like stress to me I just think about it the backlash yeah so but people know that that's my personality obviously I wouldn't act if you're a liberal downstairs unless they did you know unless they hurt me or something that would be very an opportune moment if there were stairs there but you know I I find that when you're face to face even here in Hollywood with all of the vitriol with all of the you know left and right division then when you're face to face with people it's it's not that bad and I think we have to have more conversations like that we have to get out of the Bill Maher mentality and move more into the Dave Rubin mentality yeah I love Dave's a terrific guy and that's what I've told people out here is if they do just have this weird vision of what people are that believe differently than them it's the races from the southeast and then as soon as you individually have those relationships and feel comfortable talking about it that's when things change the problem is so many conservatives been terrified of their views because they've told these views are racist misogynist you know la Islamophobic whatever that they're refusing to just talk about it but it's if you do it the right way that is the only way I feel like to move forward having those individual conversations and relationships yes really changed with you know that mentality among conservatives being very timid about saying things for fear of being caught Islamophobe homophobe transcode whatever some whether you like him or not that's one thing that trump has helped a lot of conservatives you know who's held their hand and brought them into this age where conservatives are like I don't care if you say that's racist it's facts and it's statistics you know I said I was taught when I was on Fox and Friends yesterday morning I gave some statistics on air and of course I get called a rivet assist on Twitter and I'm like facts and statistics by nature do not involve feeling things they cannot be racist these are FBI crime stats from the most recent conclusive time period 2013 and 2015 it is not racist so that's one thing that Trump has done is it has emboldened us to step out and be like I don't care if you buy me races I know I'm not alright if you liked this video and others like it please consider becoming a Premium Member to the rebel that way you'll
