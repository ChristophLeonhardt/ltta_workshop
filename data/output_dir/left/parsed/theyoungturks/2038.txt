FANTASTIC NEWS FOR YOU GUYS
ABOUT PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES
KICKING ASS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.
BETO O'ROURKE IS
RUNNING AGAINST TED CRUZ,
EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT'S A LONG
SHOT, IT'S TEXAS, TED CRUZ
BASELY CAME IN SECOND TO DONALD
TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN
PRIMARIES, HE'S GOT GOOD NAME
RECOGNITION, O'ROURKE IS REALLY
PROGRESSIVE, HOW COULD HE RUN IN
TEXAS?
WELL, HERE COMES BETO --
>>THAT'S A 
STUNNING NUMBER.
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
YOU TO KNOW HE DOESN'T TAKE
CORPORATE PAC MONEY, THAT'S ALL
REAL PEOPLE GIVING HIM MONEY,
AND 55,000 IS A GIGANTIC NUMBER,
BUT THAT WAS LAST QUARTER.
LET'S
FIND OUT HOW HE DID THIS QUARTER
THAT JUST ENDED --
>>WOW.
THAT'S A GIANT AMOUNT.
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT TO
BEAT TED CRUZ, INCLUDING ME.
WE'RE GOING TO RUN THAT PICTURE
OF SAD TED CRUZ PHONE BANKING
FOR DONALD TRUMP, IT'S GOING TO
BE ONE OF THE GREATEST DAYS IF
BETO.
TAKES HIM DOWN.
BY THE WAY
WE WILL HAVE THE LINK TO DONATE
TO BETO O'ROURKE IN THE
DISCRETION BOX, AS WELL AS ALL
THE CANDIDATES.
BY THE WAY, WE
ARE NOT DONE WITH BETO YET --
>>WOW, 140,000 DIFFERENT
CONTRIBUTIONS.
THAT'S AMAZING,
MAN.
WATCH OUT, CRUZ, HERE COMES
BETO --
>>HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE DOING A
GREAT JOB IN RAISING MONEY
AGAINST A WELL-KNOWN INCUMBENT
--
>>IN A CONGRESSIONAL RACE
THAT'S A GIGANTIC AMOUNT.
RANDY
BRYCE ALSO DOESN'T TAKE
CORPORATE PAC MONEY.
HOW DO I
KNOW?
BECAUSE HE'S A JUSTICE
DEMOCRAT.
THESE GUYS RAISING
THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM SMALL
DONORS IS UNHEARD OF --
>>LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S SO
IMPORTANT, AND NOW HAVING TALKED
TO A LOT OF THE JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS, SEEN THEIR CAMPAIGNS,
MONEY MATTERS DETERMINED THIS
AMOUNT.
NOT JUST FOR RUNNING AN
EFFICIENT, EXPENSIVE TV ADS, BUT
ALSO BECAUSE YOU NEED STAFFERS
WHO ARE GOING TO ORGANIZE YOUR
VOLUNTEERS, UNIQUE CAMPAIGN
OFFICES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF
THE STATE.
IN A GIANT STATE LIKE
TEXAS IF YOU ARE O'ROURKE OR
ALISON HARTSON IN CALIFORNIA YOU
NEED MONEY TO BUY THE VOTER
ROLLS, IT GOES ON AND ON, AND
EVEN DIGITAL ADS TAKES A LOT OF
MONEY.
SO KEEP IT GOING, GUYS,
BOTH TO THE CANDIDATES AND THOSE
GIVING THEM SMALL DOLLAR
DONATIONS, IF WE KNOCKED OUT TED
CRUZ AND PAUL RYAN WILL BE
UNREAL AND I BELIEVE IT'S
EMINENTLY DOABLE.
BY THE WAY, WE
ALSO HAVE RANDY BRYCE'S LINK
DOWN BELOW IN THE DESCRIPTION
BOX AND THE COMMENT SECTION ON
FACEBOOK, GO AND PARTICIPATE,
NOW LET ME TURN TO ALISON
HARTSON RUNNING AGAINST DIANNE
FEINSTEIN IN CALIFORNIA --
>>SHE BEAT THEM BOTH COMBINED.
THAT'S THE LEGENDARY FEINSTEIN.
YOU KNOW WHAT FEINSTEIN HAD TO
DO?
SHE HAD TO LEND HER OWN
CAMPAIGN 5 MILLION BUCKS.
NOW,
SHE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE SHE'S
ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY, SHE HAS
ABOUT $80 MILLION, ACCORDING TO
THE BEST ESTIMATES, AND HER
HUSBAND IS A BILLIONAIRE, SO 5
MILLION IS NO BIG DEAL FOR THEM.
THEY DON'T EVEN BOTHER TAKING
VOLUNTEERS ON FEINSTEIN'S
WEBSITE.
ALISON HARTSON IS OF
COURSE POWERED BY VOLUNTEERS,
SHE HAS OVER 1400 VOLUNTEERS IN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND
THAT'S WHY SHE'S DOING A GREAT
JOB.
WE'VE GOT HER LINK DOWN
BELOW AND IT'S EASY THROUGH
MEMBER, IT'S
JUSTICEDEMOCRATS.COM/ALISON,
MAKE SURE YOU CONTRIBUTE, AS YOU
CAN TELL WITH THE NUMBERS SHE'S
DOING GREAT COMPARED TO HER
OPPONENTS BUT SHE NEEDS A LOT
MORE MONEY TO RUN IN A GIGANTIC
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA.
SHE NEEDS
TO HIRE A LOT MORE VOLUNTEER
COORDINATORS, FIELD
COORDINATORS, AND THEN OF COURSE
BE ABLE TO RUN THE TOUGH-HITTING
ADS SHE'S BEEN DOING LATELY.
AND
ONE MORE THING OVERALL HERE, WE
HAVE MOMENTUM AND IT'S NOT JUST
FOR DEMOCRATS, IT'S FOR REAL
PROGRESSIVES, AND UNCORRUPTED
PROGRESSIVES.
AND I WANT TO GIVE
BETO O'ROURKE A LOT OF CREDIT
HERE, AND THE JUSTICE DEMOCRATS,
I AM PROUD THAT I HELPED FORM
THAT GROUP AND THEY SAID THEY
WILL NOT BACK ANY CANDIDATE IF
THEY TAKE CORPORATE PAC MONEY.
AND NOW AS YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF
PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOME FAIRLY
WELL-ESTABLISHED DEMOCRATS IN
THE SENATE, IF I COULD PUT IT
THAT WAY, ARE ALSO DECLARING
THAT THEY AREN'T TAKING
CORPORATE PAC MONEY.
I DON'T
KNOW THAT THE JUSTICE DEMOCRATS
WERE THE SOLE REASON, OF COURSE
NOT, BUT WHERE THEY PART OF THE
REASON, AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE
REASON, AS YOU HAVE 52
CANDIDATES OF JUSTICE DEMOCRATS
WHO SAY THEY WON'T TAKE
CORPORATE PAC MONEY AND A LOT OF
THEM ARE DOING WELL?
5 OF 7 WON
IN THE TEXAS PRIMARIES, THEY ARE
UNCORRUPTED AND THEY ARE
WONDERFUL AND THEY HAVE ALL THIS
MOMENTUM, AND I'M KIND OF PROUD
THAT WE HELPED TO START THE NO
CORPORATE PAC MONEY TREND.
BUT
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE
BEEN ON THAT BEFORE US, AND ONE
OF THEM IS BETO O'ROURKE.
THAT'S
WHY I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT
AND GIVE HIM ALL THE CREDIT IN
THE WORLD, HE DECIDED TO NOT
TAKE ANY CORPORATE PAC MONEY
EVEN FOR JUSTICE DEMOCRATS WERE
AROUND, EVEN BEFORE IT BECAME
FASHIONABLE IN THE SENATE AND
OTHER PLACES.
SO NO WONDER HE'S
GOTTEN THE CREDIBILITY HE HAS
WITH ALL THOSE DONORS AND THE
SMALL DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING
IN, AND I'M SURE THE VOLUNTEERS
COMING IN.
WE WILL HAVE ALL THE
LINKS BELOW, GO TO THEIR
WEBSITES, DONATE IF YOU CAN,
VOLUNTEER IF YOU CAN,
ALISONHARTSON.COM/NOW TO
VOLUNTEER FOR HER IN CALIFORNIA,
YOU CAN HELP THEM BY MAKING
CALLS TO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN
WISCONSIN TO DEFEAT PAUL RYAN,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN
CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A REAL
PROGRESSIVE REPRESENT CALIFORNIA
LIKE ALISON HARTSON.
WONDERFUL
NEWS BUT IT'S ON YOU TO FINISH
THIS.
IF WE GET ALL THIS WAY AND
THEN DON'T WIN THESE ELECTIONS,
OF COURSE WE DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH
OUR GOAL.
WE'VE GOT TO FINISH
THEM.
LET'S GO DO THAT TOGETHER.
