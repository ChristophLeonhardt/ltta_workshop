>> Reporter: WELL, IT IS DARK 
HERE IN JOHANNESBURG. 
VERY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT. 
THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN FAINTLY 
MAKE OUT THE MOON AS IT PASSES 
THROUGH THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE 
AND THAT SHADOW IS CAST ONTO 
THE MAN. 
CAN FAINTLY MAKE IT OUT. 
IT IS NOT COMPLETE BLACKNESS. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GATHERED 
AND IT IS EXCITING TO WITNESS 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
A LITTLE WHILE AGO IT WAS MORE 
RED AND THAT OF COURSE ELICITED 
GAS AND EXCITEMENT AND SOME 
PEOPLE STARTED HOWLING AT THE 
MOON. 
>> I LIKE THAT, HOWLING AT THE 
MOON. 
HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST WITH 
THE RED TONE THAT WE SEE NOW? 
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE LONGEST
LUNAR ECLIPSE OF THE 21st 
CENTURY. 
IT WILL TAKE ONE HOUR AND 43 
MINUTES. 
THE RED WILL NOT LAST THAT 
LONG. 
IT IS STARTING TO FADE A LITTLE 
BIT NOW. 
THAT IS AS IT MOVES OUT OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE AND YOU WILL SEE IT 
LESS AND LESS THE BEST PART HAS 
ALREADY HAPPENED FOR PEOPLE 
HERE. 
>> YOU'RE AT THE PLANETARIUM, 
SO I WOULD IMAGINE THERE ARE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE THERE WITH YOU. 
YOU SAID SOME PEOPLE WERE 
GASPING AND HOWLING AT THE MOON.
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE WITH 
YOU? 
>> Reporter: A COUPLE HUNDRED. 
THEY SET UP TELESCOPES AND 
EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT THEM. 
PEOPLE HAVE MADE THIS INTO A 
HUGE OUTING. 
THIS FAMILY BROUGHT THEIR 
CHILDREN WHO SAID THEY WOULD 
RATHER WATCH THE MOON GO READ 
THEN GO TO A PARTY. 
AND THIS BEING MODERN TIMES, 
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO TAKE A 
SELF THE WITH THE MOON. 
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT IS 
WORKING OUT. 
IT IS QUITE HARD TO GET 
LOGISTICALLY. 
EVERYONE IS DOING THEIR SULCI 
BIT HERE RIGHT NOW AND TRYING 
TO GET THAT PERFECT PICTURE 
THAT THEY CAN POST ON WHATEVER 
SOCIAL MEDIA SITE THEY ARE 
USING. 
>> Reporter: IS THE SKY 
PARTICULARLY CLEAR THERE 
TONIGHT? 
WE ARE LOOKING AT A VERY CLEAR 
PICTURE FROM A CAMERA IN 
JOHANNESBURG. 
AS YOU ARE AS WELL, AS THE SKY 
AND THE WEATHER OPERATED? 
-- COOPERATED? 
>> Reporter: IT HAS. 
THIS IS WINTER IN SOUTH AFRICA, 
SO IT IS COLD FOR US HERE. 
WHAT THAT MEANS IN JOHANNESBURG 
IS THAT WE HAVE CLEAR SKIES. 
THERE IS NO RAIN DURING THE 
WINTER SEASON. 
WE HAVE THESE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR 
SKIES. 
NO CLOUDS, IT COULD NOT BE MORE 
PERFECT WEATHER CONDITIONS. 
THIS IS A CITY. 
IT IS NOT EVEN THE BEST VIEW IN 
SOUTH AFRICA, BECAUSE THE MORE 
YOU MOVE AWAY FROM THE CITY, 
THE BETTER THE IMAGE IS. 
EVEN IN THE CITY, IT HAS BEEN 
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. 
EVERYONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO COME 
OUTSIDE ONTO THEIR BALCONIES 
AND GARDENS, OR COME TO A 
PUBLIC PLACE LIKE THE 
PLANETARIUM AND GET THIS ONCE-
IN-A-LIFETIME, ONCE IN A 
CENTURY OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS 
LONGEST LUNAR ECLIPSE. 
NEXT TO THE MOON YOU ALSO HAVE 
THE SMALL LITTLE ORANGE BLOB, 
AND THAT IS MARS WHICH IS THE 
CLOSEST IT HAS BEEN TO THE 
EARTH IN 15 YEARS. 
SO IT REALLY IS A TREAT FOR 
PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT. 
>> YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH MANY 
ASTRONOMERS AND SCIENTISTS 
ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON. 
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU, AND 
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR? 
>> Reporter: WHAT IS UNIQUE 
ABOUT THIS, EVERYTHING HAS TO 
BE IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT. 
YOU HAVE THE MOON, THE EARTH, 
AND THE SUN. 
IT CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN IT IS A 
FULL MOON. 
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WHEN 
EVERYTHING IS IN ALIGNMENT, 
THAT IS WHEN YOU GET A TOTAL 
LUNAR ECLIPSE. 
WHY EVERYONE IS EXCITED IS 
BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT SEE IT FOR 
THIS LONG FOR ANOTHER 100 
YEARS. 
THERE WILL BE MORE ECLIPSES. 
I THINK THAT IS WHAT HAS GOT 
EVERYBODY EXCITED HERE IN SOUTH 
AFRICA AND OF COURSE ACROSS THE 
REST OF THE CONTINENT. 
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING 
FOR, THE PERFECT ALIGNMENT. 
AS THE MOON PASSES THROUGH THE 
SHADOW IT IS CAST ONTO THE MOON 
AND LITTLE BITS OF THE SUN 
CREEP THROUGH AND YOU GET THIS 
RED LIGHT. 
THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THE 
NICKNAME, BLOOD MOON. 
IT CAPTURES THE THRILL THAT 
EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES HERE. 
YOU DO NOT OFTEN SEE A MAN THIS 
COLOR. 
THEY ARE ALSO LOOK FOR THE MOON 
BEING THE FURTHEST FROM THE 
PLANET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
YEAR WE HAD THE SUPER BLUE MOON 
AND IT WAS BIGGER. 
TONIGHT, IT IS KNOWN AS A MICRO 
MOON. 
IT IS FAR AWAY, BUT BEAUTIFULLY 
LIT UP AND READ. 
>> DEBORAH, YOU SPOKE WITH 
EXPERTS WHO SPOKE ABOUT TE 
MEANING OF THESE MOONS TO BRING 
-- PREINDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SCIENCE 
THAT WE HAVE TODAY. 
WHAT WERE THE SIGNS THAT THESE 
SOCIETIES USE TO ATTRIBUTE TO 
THE BLOOD MOON? 
>> Reporter: YOU CAN IMAGINE IT 
WAS TERRIFYING IN ANCIENT TIMES.
THE MOON WOULD DISAPPEAR OR 
TURN RED. 
IF YOU TOLD TIME BY THE MOON OR 
WORSHIP TO THE MOON, THIS WAS 
TERRIFYING. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THE 
GODS WERE ANGRY. 
THE INCA BELIEVED THAT THE 
JAGUAR WAS EATING THE MOON. 
THEY WOULD GATHER OUTSIDE AND 
BANGING POTS AND MAKE THEIR 
DOGS HOW TO CHASE THE JAGUAR 
AWAY. IN OTHER PARTS THEY 
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A DIRECT 
ATTACK ON THE KING, AND YOU 
WOULD GET A PROXY KING WHO 
WOULD SIT ON THE THRONE DURING 
THE TIME OF A LUNAR ECLIPSE TO 
ENSURE THAT THE KING WAS NOT 
ATTACKED. 
A LOT OF ANCIENT BELIEFS -- FOR 
MOST PEOPLE IT SIGNIFIED DROUGHT
OR TERRIBLE WEATHER OR 
SOMETHING AWFUL, IT WAS NEVER A 
GOOD SIGN. 
NOW WE KNOW WITH PRECISION WHEN 
IT WILL OCCUR. 
IT IS NOT TERRIFYING, JUST 
EXCITING AND A CHANCE TO TAKE A 
SOPHIE. 
>> I CAN IMAGINE HOW TERRIFYING 
IT MUST HAVE BEEN. 
ONE OF THE THINGS EXPERTS SAY 
IS THAT SCIENTISTS KNEW THIS 
WOULD HAPPEN AND HOW LONG IT 
WOULD LAST THAT THEY DID NOT 
KNOW THE EXACT YOU THAT THE 
MOON WOULD TAKE ON. 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE 
COLOR FROM THERE? 
WE SEE THE MONITOR, SO WE DON'T 
SEE THE SAME COLOR THAT THE 
WITH THE NAKED EYE. 
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT YOU 
MARK -- HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE 
IT? 
>> Reporter: YOU DON'T NEED A 
TELESCOPE, AT ITS PEAK IT WAS 
CERTAINLY RED. 
NOT BRIGHT RED, YOU HAVE THE 
SHADOW OVER IT, AND WE ARE IN 
JOHANNESBURG, SO THERE IS AN 
AMOUNT OF POLLUTION AND DEBRIS 
OR DUST. 
WE DO NOT HAVE CLOUD COVER, SO 
IT IS ONE OF HIS RIGHTIST HERE, 
AND THE MORE YOU MOVE AWAY FROM 
THE CITY LIGHTS, WE WERE 
SPEAKING TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
WHO WERE FAR AWAY IN A FARMING 
COMMUNITY AND THEY SAW A MUCH 
BRIGHTER RED IN. 
BUT, EVEN FOR US IN 
JOHANNESBURG, IT WAS VERY RED 
AT ITS PEAK. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS 
COSMIC PHENOMENON IS A KEEN, HE 
IS A PROFESSOR OF SPACE SCIENCE 
AT THE FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF 
TECHNOLOGY. 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR US WHAT IS 
HAPPENING? 
>> YES. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE EARTH AT ALL 
TIMES, BECAUSE IT IS ORBITING 
THE SUN, IT HAS A LONG SHADOW 
THAT EXTENDS OUT FROM IT. 
THE MOON IS VERY FAR AWAY. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISTANCE 
FROM THE CENTER OF THE EARTH TO 
THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH -- THE 
MOON IS ABOUT 65 EARTH RADII 
AWAY. 
IT IS VERY FAR. 
AND, WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT 
NOW IS THAT THE MOON IS AT HIS 
FURTHEST WIN IN ITS ORBIT 
AROUND THE EARTH, WHICH IS NOT 
A PERFECT CIRCLE. 
SOMETIMES IT IS CLOSER, 
SOMETIMES NOT. 
WHEN IT IS CLOSER IT MOVES 
QUICKER, AND WHEN IT IS FURTHER 
AWAY IT IS SLOW. 
SO, RIGHT NOW IT IS FAR AWAY, 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF 
EARTH'S SHADOW, THE MOON COULD 
PASS THROUGH THE EDGE OR THE 
CENTER OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. 
THIS TIME, THE MOON IS FAR AWAY 
AND IS GOING THROUGH THE CENTER 
OF THE SHADOW. 
THAT MAKES IT AN INCREDIBLY 
LONG ECLIPSE. 
WHAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW IS THE 
MOON JUST WENT IN TOTALITY. 
THE EARTH'S SHADOW HAS A DARK 
INNER PART WHERE THE LIGHT IS 
COMPLETELY BLOCKED. 
IF YOU'RE STANDING ON THE 
MOON'S SURFACE YOU COULD NOT 
SEE THE SUN. 
YOU SEE A RING AROUND THE EARTH 
AND IT IS A TOTAL ECLIPSE. 
BUT, IF YOU ARE ON THE EARTH, 
THEN THE ENTIRE HEMISPHEREÃƒ
HEMISPHERE GETS TO SEE THE 
ECLIPSE. 
WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE 
CANNOT SEE IT. 
BUT, THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE 
BENDS THE LIGHT, SO IT FALLS ON 
THE MOON, BUT IT ALSO FILTERS 
THE LIGHT. 
THE BLUE LIGHT GETS SCATTERED 
OUT BY A PROCESS AND THE RED 
LIGHT MAKES IT THROUGH, SO 
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF RED 
LIGHT FILTERED THROUGH, FALLING 
ON THE MOON, AND WE GET THIS 
BLOOD MOON AND THIS VERY LONG, 
ONCE IN A CENTURY ECLIPSE. 
>> THAT IS WHY IT IS RED, VERY 
INTERESTING. 
THIS IS THE LONGEST ECLIPSE OF 
THE CENTURY SO FAR. 
WILL THERE BE A LONGER ONE? 
>> IF YOU GO AND LOOK UP THE 
ECLIPSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED, 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR IS 
WHEN THERE WILL BE A CENTRAL 
ECLIPSE, MEANING THE MOON GOES 
THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE 
EARTH'S SHADOW, AND THAT 
ECLIPSE OCCURRING WHEN THE MOON 
IS IN ITS NEAREST/FURTHEST POINT
FROM THE EARTH. 
THIS HAS BOTH CONDITIONS. 
THERE IS NOT ANOTHER ONE OF THE 
CENTURY THAT HAS BOTH 
CONDITIONS, BUT WE CAN PREDICT 
THESE FAR INTO THE FUTURE. 
THERE IS A WEBSITE THAT SHOWS 
YOU PHOTOGRAPHS OF HOW THE MOON 
WILL PASS THROUGH THE EARTH 
SHADOW AND WHERE IT WILL BE IN 
ITS ORBIT. 
IF YOU CAN HANG AROUND FOR A 
FEW HUNDRED YEARS, YOU WILL SEE 
ANOTHER ONE. 
>> HAS THE TEMPERATURE ON THE 
MOON DROPPED SINCE THE SUN IS 
NOT HITTING IT DIRECTLY? 
>> WHEN THE SUN'S RAYS ARE 
DIRECTLY FOLLOWING ON A SURFACE,
HERE WE ARE ON EARTH, AND WE 
HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS ABLE 
TO FILTER OUT A LOT OF THE 
RADIATION THAT WE ARE NOT 
RECEIVING. 
A LOT OF THE ULTRAVIOLET AND 
INFRARED IS FILTERED OUT. 
THE MOON DOES NOT HAVE AN 
ATMOSPHERE. 
WHEN THE SUNLIGHT FALLS ON IT, 
IF YOU HAD SOMETHING MEASURING 
TEMPERATURES YOU WOULD MEASURE 
A HIGH RATE OF SOLAR ENERGY 
BEING ABSORBED ON THE SURFACE, 
BUT NOW IT IS BLOCKED OUT AND 
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT RADIATION 
IS BLOCKED OUT SO YOU DO NOT 
GET THAT ENERGY. 
YOU ARE COLDER. 
>> WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF 
INTEREST IN THIS EVENT. 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE 
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY? 
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THIS 
INTEREST? 
>> WE CERTAINLY ARE, BECAUSE A 
RISING TIDE FLOATS ALL BOATS. 
AND THE SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION 
COMES FROM SCIENTIFIC 
INSPIRATION. 
SO, GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE 
INVOLVED, LETTING THE PUBLIC 
KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT IS WORTH YOUR TAX DOLLARS 
TO INVEST IN, BECAUSE YOU CAN 
THINK ABOUT -- WE HAVE HEARD OF 
PEOPLE THAT INVEST IN 
BUSINESSES AND STARTUPS AND 
THIS SORT OF THING. 
BASIC SCIENTIFIC INVESTMENT IS 
LIKE INVESTING IN STARTUPS THAT 
DO NOT YET EXIST. 
SO, ONCE WE GET EVERYONE 
EXCITED ABOUT SCIENCE AND WE 
RECOGNIZE IT IS IMPORTANT, THAT 
NOT ONLY IMPROVES OUR LIVES 
THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC THINGS 
THAT WE LEARN AND THE 
ENGINEERING THAT CREATES NEW 
STUFF, BUT IT ALSO CREATES MORE 
PROSPERITY. 
>> YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING EXCITED 
ABOUT SCIENCE IS A GOOD THING. 
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE 
LOOKING AT A PICTURE OF THE 
BLOOD RED MOON ON THE LEFT-HAND 
SIDE, AND A BRIGHT STAR UP IN 
THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER. 
THAT IS MARS, RIGHT? 
>> THAT IS RIGHT, YEAH. 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING THING. 
WHEN WE HAVE A FULL MOON, THAT 
MEANS THAT THE SUN, EARTH, AND 
MOON ARE LINED UP. 
RIGHT NOW, MARS IS AT WHAT WE 
ASTRONOMERS CALL OPPOSITION. 
MARS IS ON THAT LINE ALSO. 
RIGHT NOW, THE EARTH, THE SUN 
AND MOON ARE ALL IN A LINE. 
AND, THAT IS WHY WE ARE LOOKING 
PAST THE MOON OUT TOWARDS MARS 
WHICH IS TENS OF MILLIONS OF 
LIGHT METER -- LIGHT YEARS 
AWAY. 
WE HAVE A FULL MOON DURING THIS 
ECLIPSE, AND WE ALSO HAVE A 
FULL MARS. 
>> WHAT IS GOING ON ON MARS IF 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MOON 
DROPPING TEMPERATURE AND WHAT 
IT WOULD BE LIKE -- WHAT IS 
HAPPENING ON MARS RIGHT NOW? 
>> WHAT MARS WOULD SEE 
POTENTIALLY WOULD BE -- WHEN WE 
LOOK AT VENUS PASS IN FRONT OF 
THE FACE OF THE SUN, WE CALL 
THAT A TRANSIT. 
I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE LINED 
UP SUFFICIENTLY FOR THERE TO BE 
AN EARTH TRANSIT, BUT THAT IS 
ABOUT IT. 
EARTH'S SHADOW DOES NOT EXTEND 
THAT FAR, BUT IT IS SIMILAR TO 
THE WAY THAT WE DISCOVER 
PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS. 
WHEN THE PLANET PASSES IN FRONT 
OF THE DISC OF THE STAR YOU GET 
A LITTLE DROP IN THE 
BRIGHTNESS. 
IF YOU ARE A SCIENTIST ON MARS 
YOU COULD BE TAKING DATA AND 
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THE 
EARTH/MOON SYSTEM BLOCKING OUT 
LIFE. 
IF YOU DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH 
RESOLUTION TO SEE THAT THEY ARE 
TWO SEPARATE BODIES, YOU COULD 
FIGURE IT OUT FROM THE DATA. 
HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE 
IT OUT THIS TIME, BECAUSE THE 
MOON IS IN THE EARTH'S SHADOW, 
YOU WOULD MISS THE MOON. 
BUT, POTENTIALLY YOU COULD DO 
THAT AT OTHER TIMES. 
>> WAS A THAT YOU ARE NEIL 
ARMSTRONG, YOU LANDED ON THE 
MOON AT THE TIME OF THE LUNAR 
ECLIPSE, YOU LOOK UP -- WHAT 
WOULD YOU SEE? 
>> THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL 
QUESTION. 
SO, AGAIN THE EARTH SHADOW IS 
COMPLEX. 
THERE IS A DARK INNER REGION 
THAT WE CALL THE UMBRA, AND 
THEN THERE IS AN OUTER REGION. 
AT FIRST, WHAT HAPPENS IS THE 
MOON PASSES INTO THE OUTSIDE 
REGION. 
IF YOU ARE ON THE MOON YOU 
WOULD SEE A CHUNK TAKEN OUT OF 
THE SUN FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, 
AND THEN YOU SEE THE EARTH AS 
IT PASSES YOU SEE MORE AND MORE 
OF THE SUN GETTING BLOCKED OUT, 
AND NOW IMAGINE -- THE EARTH 
SHADOW IS WAY BIGGER THAN THE 
SIZE OF THE SUN, SO YOU WOULD 
HAVE THIS BIG ARC COVERING THE 
SUN. ONCE THE TOTALITY STARTED, 
THAT WOULD BE A FULL ECLIPSE. 
YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE 
THE SUN AT ALL AND YOU WOULD 
SEE THE EARTH WITH THIS RED 
RING AROUND IT WHERE THE LIGHT 
IS FILTERED THROUGH THE 
ATMOSPHERE. 
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A COOL VIEW 
AS WELL. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING 
WITH US TODAY. 
>> WONDERFUL. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
WHEN WE RETURN WE WILL HAVE THE 
REST OF THE DAY'S NEWS. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN, CBS 
NEWS , ALWAYS ON.
