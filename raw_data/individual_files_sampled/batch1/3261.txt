I don't see how he has enough time to tweet I don't have time to tweet now I'm a Twitter person I just don't have time for that right now I do not agree with the president's ban on immigration I think it was poorly implemented America is built on foreigners and I believe that that's what makes this country so great I think that that's kind of against the grain of our culture and society solving a problem that doesn't exist he's used that isn't where our troubles are coming from regarding terrorism it was really really alarming to me because I felt like I could be traveling somewhere and they said you know not let me in or do extra questioning that it's just totally unnecessary I think on some issues he's doing an okay job I think they're still a lot of people that went through the recession that aren't working at nearly the same level there are American citizens with degrees and a lot of things and they're not getting the positions and the jobs that they worked hard for went to school for but I think we need to figure out ways to take care of ourselves instead of like always pushing money to other countries so we have to take care of our own people before others to me it's selfish I don't like the america first business I really don't we're all in this together mr. Trump he has some good points but not all good points so that being said it's just like we got to wait that's the first month that he's been president I don't even think it's been a whole 20 days yes so I'm just looking forward to seeing what was going to come from all of this
