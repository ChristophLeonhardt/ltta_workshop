Patrick Carney's high standards use a
corner step 1 we sit down with Patrick
Carney from the Black Keys step 2 we
play him some recently released songs
step 3 he tells us what he thinks about
these songs so Patrick we're gonna start
now
okay okay I don't hate that now I
wouldn't buy that but I wouldn't mind if
it came on an Abercrombie & Fitch what
is name of the band it's One Republic
whatever okay
next song so embarrassed I liked
wonderful look okay just Norah Jones she
hasn't started singing yet but I notice
orgeous it's cool it's a tragedy I think
once I've compared her music to the
theme song of Fraser but this the top
this does it that's just that was me
being in the asshole
I like this no medal cuz up no no no
medal Hostin okay we might want to
listen to that
I just want to say one thing you know
how hard it is to get your guitar to
sound like a modem in 1996
first of all I hate guitars to sound
like that I'm lost because the guitar at
the top of it sounds so shitty
it's like I have the tiger but not even
nearly as good as that it sounds like
Hulk Hogan is playing the guitar
I'm at hawk Hogan once he's really
really nice and he did say this to me
these fingers have never touched a fret
been up and down a Florida coast playing
and playing rock'n'roll all to 70s never
touched a fret I think that's what you
say Hussein Lee played a fretless bass
in a prog band or something cool
but the thing is that song is growing on
me I've heard it now it's one of those
things like this thing about music the
more you hear something the more you
like it
that's why Paola worked
