so Alison Hartson is now the Senate candidate in California for the Justice Democrats she's taking on Dianne Feinstein she was the National Director of Wolfpack she was one of the national directors Mike Minetta is the other so Wolfpack needs to replace her now you can't replace her overall but we're gonna get a young guy in who we think is great who's been a fighter for us already at the state level and has been a organizer for us but what we're asking you to do is to help by becoming a member it's a it's a simple Drive and and I hope that you guys can do this because if we don't do this we can't get money out of politics and then we lose on all the issues and that neutrality the environment bank bailouts and the list goes on and on so what we want you to do is go to wolf dash pack.com slash John and sign up to become a member okay and we're gonna do a thermometer if we get to 250 members then we hire John we need the money to hire John otherwise we can't hire them and that's the way things work because we don't have big donors we just have you guys and if you fight together you can win together I'm gonna show you a video of John in a second that shows you that here's a picture of John Shen he is from Connecticut and the reason the graphic says the closer next to me is because that's how he got his nickname because when they were fighting in Connecticut he would drive an hour away from his home to go canvass voters to get them to turn out to make a difference and he was always the last guy in because he had to work and then drive all the way in and then canvass and he's the last one out and and he worked so hard he was the warrior of the month in April and then he became the organizing director in Connecticut he's got a master's degree from Yale and he's fighting right now for no money and hopefully we could hire him for very little money to help bring democracy back a lot of people go to Ivy League colleges and think yet you're Ching I'm gonna get paid I'm gonna get a lot of money I'm gonna do go to finance I'm gonna do a start-up I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that right so John is busting his ass as a volunteer to try to get democracy back and get money out of let's hire him let's raise enough money to be able to hire MIT doesn't take that much we need 250 people to do that by the way he's currently a scientist who studies bacteria so it's a good person to clean up Washington so let me show you who John it is take a look at this short video this is what they did when they were in Illinois and they done a get-together for Wolf Pack directors and organizers and and John told the story back then my name is John Chen I organize for the state of Connecticut I'm a research associate for me getting money out of politics is the issue that stands in the way of every other issue that I care about issues like stopping the negative impacts of climate change or getting universal health care are all being held up by the facts that in this country people who have more money to spend in our political system than others have a louder voice money in politics is personal to me just in this most previous election I I wasn't very politically active or politically conscious even before maybe a year and a half ago and I was sort of awakens by Bernie Sanders campaign and since then I've seen a lot of the negative impacts of money in politics and the things that money in politics has enabled to become reality in our country it's not the sort of world that I want to live in or the kind of country I want to live in in the future it's not the kind of country that I was promised as a kid or that I want to leave to my children so that's what kind of way I'm fighting for this it's it's really been a great experience so far working with the team meeting people from really all walks of life in Connecticut and working towards this like same goal currently I am the organizing director for the state of Connecticut to come here today I've taken two days off of work spent money out of my my own pocket to buy a plane ticket pay for the hotel really because I believe you know in this issue and this organization a lot and and the people I've met through my time here kid went to Yale and he's got very little money and he's paid out of his own pocket to go to learn about organizing so it can go back home and fight to get money out of politics so we can free our government you gotta help us hire him we got to get wars like this in here and and he says in the longer version of the video that he they have one in Connecticut yeah we won in five states Connecticut's not one of them yet we're really really close there and he said even though we didn't win yet the wins that we did get man he said it's one of the most fulfilling things he's ever done in his life so it low-key I get it not everybody's got the money to donate it but then for God's sake volunteer yourself and you see what we do Allison was a teacher in Orange County she got promoted all the way up mic Mineta it was a guy who would go up on telephone poles to fix them he's the national director the other guys are one of them is called the mechanic as he's a mechanic and John went to Yale and and he came in and he worked the hardest to get to a position let us hire John wolf dash pack.com slash John make it happen and together if we fight together we win together I want to deliver five new states for you guys this year but we need the staff to be able to do it so let's go do it together right now thank you help us build
