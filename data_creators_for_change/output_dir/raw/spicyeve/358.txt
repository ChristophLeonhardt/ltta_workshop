34
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,050
too hesitant to buy it because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI</font>

35
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,940
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> sovereign huge bottles I'm like</font>

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,550
that's commitment I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really into</font>

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,890
that right now but these were a dollar

38

42
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,760
Giovanni the Giovanni smooth at soap

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,890
conditioner and it's cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

44
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,970
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a whole product</font>

45
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,380
Giovanni is actually pretty expensive

46
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,840
they started selling it at Target and a

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,739
little sample that was like smaller than

48
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,630
those sample swab lotions you don't talk

49
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sample looks like three dollars</font>

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,030
but at this co-op that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it's</font>

51
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an organic food store you could buy</font>

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,079
a bottle or bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own and they had</font>

53
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,440
pumps or<font color="#E5E5E5"> products pumps of oil pumps of</font>

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,079
this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in huge like massive</font>

55
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,120
pumps and you can fill your own

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,010
container instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of buying more</font>

57
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,599
containers and throwing them away and

58
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the whole organic thing uh so I</font>

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,220
just had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bottle and I filled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,620
up with the conditioner and it was

61
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually cheaper this thing which is</font>

62
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,340
larger is actually cheaper than the

63
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,269
sample size at target henceforth I'm

64
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited I'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to wash my hair</font>

65
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,040
with one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these condition and detangle</font>

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,139
and once again hit it with the kinky

67
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:34,120
curly video about that coming up soon

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,130
all of this stuff so yeah good a good

69
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,310
look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know how to wear this</font>

70
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,790
dress leave a comment because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

71
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,819

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,120
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put the other shirt that I bought</font>

73
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,590
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dress that I don't know how to</font>

74
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,910
wear and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thought I'd come back</font>

75
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,210
and do a length check for you guys why

76
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,590
not because I actually worried that my

77
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,940
hair is it growing and even if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

78
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,760
that was probably be my fault um but

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,220

80
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,310
