1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,580
You may have never
heard of Kim Yong-chol.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,050
But you’ve probably
seen him before.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,450
Here he is sitting
next to Ivanka Trump

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,190
at the Winter Olympics
in Pyeongchang.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,950
Here, with the
North Korean leader

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,590
at the inter-Korean
summit in April.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,870
Here, leading a delegation
to South Korea

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,690
during military talks in 2007.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,360
Here, with Kim Jong-il.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,100
And here, with Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,060
in Pyongyang in May.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,210
The former head of
North Korea’s spy agency

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,840
is said to be one of Kim
Jong-un’s closest aides.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,670
He worked for all three
leaders of the Kim dynasty,

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,020
and is one of its longest-
serving senior officials.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,160
But he has a controversial past.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,280
He’s still on sanctions lists in
South Korea and the United States.

18
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,180
South Korea accuses
Kim Yong-chol

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,020
of being involved in several
high-profile attacks.

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,910
He was allegedly
behind the sinking

21
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,640
of a South Korean
naval ship in 2010

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,900
that killed 46 sailors,

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,885
and of masterminding
an attack

24
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:13,115
on a South Korean island
the same year.

25
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,190
Under his leadership, 
North Korea’s spy agency

26
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,340
was suspected by the U.S.
of launching a cyberattack

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,940
against Sony Pictures in 2014.

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,590
It apparently was
in retaliation

29
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,060
to the film “The Interview,”
which mocked Kim Jong-un.

30
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,940
“I don’t need my father.”

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,060
Kim Yong-chol is also no stranger
to nuclear diplomacy.

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,940
He’s been involved in various
rounds of negotiations

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,780
to limit North Korea’s
nuclear weapons.

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,090
This week, he became 
the highest-ranking

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:00:00,000
North Korean official to visit the
United States since 2000.
