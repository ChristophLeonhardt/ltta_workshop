2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,870
with some journalists where they said

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you seem like you're okay but</font>

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,950

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,580
said no I what I'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is what</font>

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,420
I think I I believe in this country I

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,340

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people are more good than bad I</font>

9
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,668
believe tragic things happen i think

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's evil in the world but i think</font>

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day if we work</font>

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,730
hard and if we're true to those things

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,469
in us that feel true and feel right that

14
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,190
the world gets a little better each time

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,600
that's what this presence is tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not just a matter</font>

17

<font color="#E5E5E5">of no drama Obama this is this is what I</font>

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,270

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,600
closed doors I Chris more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do oh</font>

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,240
and sometimes I get mad and frustrated

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,420
like everybody else's but at my core I

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,560
think we're going to be okay we just

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,970
have to fight for it we have to work for

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,220
it and not take it for granted and I
