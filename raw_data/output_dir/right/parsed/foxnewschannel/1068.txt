EVEN BEFORE LEAVING THE
WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT RAISE
A FEW EYEBROWS AROUND THE GLOBE
BY SUGGESTING RUSSIA SHOULD BE

THEY SHOULD LET RUSSIA COME BACK
AGAIN BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE
RUSSIA AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.
>> IT WAS QUINTESSENTIAL TRUMP.
IT REVERBERATED ACROSS THE GLOBE
AND CAROMED ACROSS THE PARTISAN
POLITICAL DIVIDE HERE AT HOME.

HAVING A MEETING WITHOUT RUSSIA
BEING IN THE MEETING?
I WOULD RECOMMEND, AND IT'S UP
TO THEM, BUT RUSSIA SHOULD BE IN
THE MEETING.
>> Reporter: RUSSIA WAS KICKED
OUT OF THE G8 BECAUSE IT INVADED
UKRAINE, AND ANNEXED CRIMEA.
THE PRESIDENT SENTIMENT LET
RUSSIA SHOULD BE PART OF THE
GATHERING IN QUEBEC CLEARLY AT
ODDS WITH MANY IN HIS OWN PARTY
AND KEY ALLIES FROM AROUND THE
WORLD, INCLUDING THE U.K. WHICH
REALLY DON'T LIKE IT WEIGHED IN
WITH THE STATEMENT THAT READ, IN
PART, THE PRIME MINISTER'S HAS
ALWAYS SAID WE SHOULD ENGAGE
WITH RUSSIA BUT BEWARE.
WE HAVE SEEN THE LINE FROM
RUSSIA IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.
BEFORE ANY CONVERSATIONS COULD
TAKE PLACE ABOUT RUSSIA
REJOINING, IT NEEDS TO CHANGE
ITS APPROACH.
ONCE ON THE GROUND IN QUEBEC,
THE PRESIDENT STOOD WITH WORLD
