1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:02,536
RIGHT?

2
00:00:02,537 --> 00:00:03,803
THIS COULDN'T POSSIBLY GO ANY

3
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:04,271
SLOWER.

4
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:05,639
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,574
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

6
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:10,577
THIS IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE FROM

7
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:11,545
THE ADMINISTRATION'S

8
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:12,979
PERSPECTIVE THEY UNDERSTAND

9
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,547
YOU'LL GET PUSHBACK.

10
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:14,314
THEY PREPARED FOR IT.

11
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:16,283
IF I COULD USE THE EXAMPLE OF

12
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,319
THE STICKS AND CARROTS.

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,720
UNDERSTAND THIS, THE STICKS

14
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,689
WOULD BE LIKE SANCTIONS, THE

15
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,991
STICKS WOULD BE THINGS LIKE

16
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,192
THREATS, QUITE FRANKLY.

17
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,194
BUT THEN THE CARROTS ARE THINGS

18
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,963
LIKE DIPLOMACY AND RELIEF.

19
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,831
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS HAVE

20
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,600
SUGGESTED THAT THE TONE STRUCK

21
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,169
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ONE OF

22
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,304
ASPIRATION AND COOPERATION AND

23
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:38,972
POSSIBILITY BUT WHAT THEY'RE

24
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,747
AND NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

25
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,348
JOHN BOLTON.

26
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,383
THEY FEEL LIKE THE CONVERSATION

27
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,185
WITH THOSE GENTLEMEN HAS BEEN

28
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,253
FAR LESS CONSTRUCTIVE.

29
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,389
IN FACT, THE NORTH HAS

30
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,991
PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED SENIOR

31
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:03,330
U.S. OFFICIALS BEING

32
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:03,797
GANGSTER-LIKE.

33
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:04,531
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TELL ME

34
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,366
AS EARLY AS THIS MORNING, THIS

35
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,373
TOWARD DENUCLEARIZATION.

36
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,408
THAT WORK CONTINUES UP TO THIS

37
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,880
VERY MOM END AND COULD RAMP UP

38
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,216
AS THE TWO SIDES MEET AGAIN.

39
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,417
>> SWITCH TO ANOTHER TOPIC.

40
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,852
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT THE

41
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,187
VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO YESTERDAY.

42
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,990
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONE OF

43
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,424
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH A

44
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:31,858
LOVELY CITY.

45
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,493
YOU HAVE TO WONDER AT WHAT

46
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,462
POINT DO YOU ACCEPT FEDERAL

47
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:35,762
HELP?

48
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,200
MADE A STANDING OFFER FOR

49
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,468
ASSISTANCE BUT IN WHAT FORM AND

50
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,370
JUST HOW THAT WOULD PLAY OUT IN

51
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,538
REALITY IS A STICKING POINT.

52
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,141
AND FOR THE CITY, WHILE HELP IS

53
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,976
OBVIOUSLY NEEDED, THERE IS A

54
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:50,877
POLITICAL ELEMENT TO THIS

55
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:51,845
STORY, JULIE.

56
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,913
IT COULD BE A MAJOR STICKING

57
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,382
POINT.

58
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,383
FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

59
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,184
OFFICIAL RAHM HE MEN WALL IS

60
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,324
CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT AND

61
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,426
HIS ADMINISTRATION ON A HOST OF

62
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:06,893
ISSUES.

63
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,528
IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT

64
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,729
CIRCUMSTANCE FOR HIM AND IT

65
00:02:09,729 --> 00:00:00,000
COULD BE THE PROBLEM FOR
