>>> THIS IS AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT.
NOW REPORTING, GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR RIGHT 
NOW BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ABOUT TO APPEAR ON THE SOUTH 
LUNE OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU SEE IT SURROUNDED BY 
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
TO CELEBRATE THE PASSAGE OF 
THEIR MASSIVE $1.5 TRILLION TAX 
PLAN.
THE LARGEST OVERHAUL IN A 
GENERATION.
BRINGS THE CORPORATE TAX RATE 
DOWN PERMANENTLY FROM 35% TO 
21%.
TEMPORARY CUTS ON INDIVIDUAL TAX
RATES INCLUDING THE TOP RATE 
FROM 39.6% TO 37%.
PAYS IT IN PART BY DOING AWAY 
WITH SEVERAL DEDUCTIONS 
INCLUDING THE STATE AND LOCAL 
PROPERTY TAX.
THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION 
IS CAPPED AT $750, DOWN FROM $1 
MILLION.
BEYOND THAT, IT GIVES A BENEFIT 
TO THE WEALTHY.
THE ESTATE AND GIFT TAX 
EXEMPTION IS DOUBLED FROM $5.6 
MILLION TO OVER $11 MILLION A 
PERSON.
AND IT ELIMINATES THAT OBAMACARE
MANDATE TO BUY HEALTH 
TEST.
TEST.
TEST.
WILL SEE AN INCOME TAX CUT OF 
MORE THAN $2,000.
THEY'LL HAVE $2,000, AND THAT'S,
IN MY OPINION, GOING TO BE LESS 
THAN THE AVERAGE.
YOU'LL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN 
THAT.
ONE THING VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE
FARMERS, THE GREAT FARMERS AND 
THE GREAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS 
THAT WERE FORCED TO SELL THEIR 
BUSINESSES AT BARGAIN BASEMENT 
NUMBERS.
WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR THE MOST 
PART ESTATE TAX IS WIPED OUT SO 
THEY CAN KEEP THEIR FARMS IN THE
FAMILY.
THAT TO ME IS A VERY BIG FACTOR.
VERY BIG.
THIS IS -- THIS IS GOING TO MEAN
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BE COMING
BACK.
I CAMPAIGNED ON THE FACT THAT 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE OUR 
COMPANIES ANYMORE.
THEY'RE GOING TO STAY IN OUR 
COUNTRY AND THEY'RE GOING TO 
STAY IN OUR COUNTRY.
YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT'S 
HAPPENING EVEN AT THIS PROSPECT,
BUT THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS 
ENTHUSIASM RIGHT NOW IN OUR 
COUNTRY AND WE HAVE COMPANIES 
POURING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRIES.
THAT MEANS JOBS AND REALLY THE 
FORMATION OF NEW, YOUNG, 
BEAUTIFUL, STRONG COMPANIES.
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY 
IMPORTANT.
THE PASSTHROUGHS YOU KNOW ALL 
ABOUT AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES 
ARE GOING TO BE BIG 
BENEFICIARIES.
WE'RE GOING TO BRING AT LEAST $4
TRILLION BACK IN THE COUNTRY, 
MONEY THAT WAS FROZEN OVERSEAS 
AND PARTS OF THE WORLD, SOME OF 
US DON'T EVEN LIKE US AND THEY 
HAD THE MONEY.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE 
MONEY LONG.
SO IT'S REALLY, I GUESS IT'S 
VERY SIMPLE.
WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THIS EXPRESSION, BUT WE ARE 
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT, HAVE 
YOU?
I WANT TO -- I WANT TO HAVE THEM
GET UP AND GET THE GLAMOUR AND 
GLORY, AND I JUST WANT TO HAVE A
FEW COME UP AND THEY'LL SPEAK 
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
THE SHORTER THE BETTER.
THAT WAY WE CAN GET ALL OF YOU.
WE'LL GET EVERYBODY UP, RIGHT?
BUT I WANT TO THANK MITCH 
McCONNELL.
I WANT TO THANK -- WHAT A JOB.
WHAT A JOB.
I WANT TO THANK PAUL.
THEY'RE GOING TO SPEAK.
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY A FEW 
WORDS.
PAUL RYAN AND MITCH, IT WAS A 
LITTLE TEAM.
WE JUST GOT TOGETHER AND WE 
WOULD WORK VERY HARD, DIDN'T WE?
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS A LOT OF 
FUN.
ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN WHEN YOU 
WIN.
IF YOU WORK HARD AND LOSE, 
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO NAME A FEW
NAMES AND THEN SOME OF THEM WILL
COME UP.
BUT PEOPLE THAT I SAW SO MUCH 
OVER THE LAST MONTH AND REALLY 
OVER THE LAST ALMOST YEAR.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, WE
HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN A YEAR.
AND WE DID THE LARGEST TAX CUT 
IN OUR HISTORY.
I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT WE 
ESSENTIALLY REPEALED OBAMACARE 
BOSS WE GOT RID OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WHICH WAS 
TERRIBLE.
AND THAT WAS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF
FUNDING OF OBAMACARE.
AND ANWAR, A FRIEND OF MINE, OH,
CONGRATULATIONS.
AND DAN.
WHERE'S DAN?
AND DON, TOO.
WHERE'S DAN?
>> I'LL TELL YOU, BETWEEN DAN 
AND DON AND LISA, YOU'VE DONE A 
VERY GREAT JOB.
SO A FRIEND OF MINE CALLED UP 
ABOUT ANWAR.
HE SAID YOU DIDN'T GET ANWAR.
I SAID TELL ME ABOUT ANWAR.
HE SAID WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
GET THAT PASSED, THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY, THE WORLD, THEY TRIED 
IN RONALD REAGAN.
THEY TRIED WITH THE BUSHES.
THEY TRIED WITH EVERYBODY.
THEY NEVER GOT ANWAR, BUT WE GOT
IT IN THE BILL.
WE HAVE MANDATE.
AND WE HAVE THE TAX CUT.
AND WE HAVE THE REFORM.
WHEN YOU ADD UP THE SIZE OF THIS
BILL, IT'S REALLY GREAT.
SO LISA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LISA MURKOWSKI.
SO JOHN CORNYN, THE GREAT 
CHAIRMAN ORRIN HATCH.
GREAT JOB.
WOW.
ORRIN IS A SPECIAL PERSON.
TIM SCOTT, WHO HAS BEEN SO 
INCREDIBLE.
HE'S GOING TO SAY A FEW WORDS.
WHERE IS TIM?
YOU PICK IT UP.
HE'S YOUNGER THAN I AM.
I HAVE IT MOSTLY MEMORIZED.
BUT TIM SCOTT HAS BEEN GREAT.
JOHN THUNE.
WHERE'S JOHN?
JOHN, GREAT JOB, JOHN.
ROB PORTMAN, A REAL STUDENT OF 
THE TAX WORLD.
ROB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WANT TO THANK -- I SAID HELLO 
TO JOHN CORNYN.
PAT TOOMEY, HE HAS BEEN -- WE 
RODE TOGETHER IN PENNSYLVANIA, 
BUT PAT, WHERE'S PAT?
PAT.
GREAT JOB.
HE KNOWS HIS BUSINESS.
SUSAN COLLINS, WE WANT TO THANK.
SUSAN'S AROUND SOMEPLACE.
SUSAN.
THANK YOU, SUSAN.
ALL FRIENDS.
I LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE WARRIORS 
TOGETHER.
CHRISTY NOME AND DIANE BLACK.
OUR GREAT SPEAKER, PAUL RYAN.
HE IS A GREAT SPEAKER.
GREAT JOB.
KEVIN McCARTHY.
KEVIN.
WHAT A JOB, KEVIN.
WE HAD FUN.
DID WE HAVE A GOOD TIME?
STEVE SCALISE.
HE'S BRAVER THAN ALL OF US.
HE'S BRAVER.
WHERE IS HE?
OH, BOY.
I DON'T KNOW.
NOT A GOOD WAY.
WE LOVE YOU, STEVE.
GREAT JOB.
GREAT JOB.
KEVIN BRADY.
KEVIN.
KEVIN BRADY.
SO MAYBE WHAT I'LL DO IS, AND BY
THE WAY, I MENTIONED AT&T, BUT 
MANY COMPANIES HAVE COME FORWARD
SAYING THEY'RE SO HAPPY AND 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SIMILAR 
ANNOUNCEMENTS.
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING 
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY SPECIAL.
WE'RE BRINGING THE ENTREPRENEUR 
BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY.
WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL THE 
KNOTS AND TIES AND YOU'RE GOING 
TO SEE.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS.
ULTIMATELY WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
IT MEANS JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY A 
SPECIAL PERIOD OF TIME.
WE'RE IN A SPEC PERIOD OF TIME.
IT'S GOING TO BE MORE SO.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY BEHIND
ME.
MAYBE I COULD START WITH MITCH 
AND THEN PAUL AND A FEW OF THE 
FOLKS COME UP TO SAY A FEW WORDS
AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE FUN.
THANK YOU.
MITCH, HOW ABOUT YOU START IT?
>> AND WITH THAT, A BUOYANT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT THERE, 
CELEBRATING THE PASSAGE OF WHAT 
HE CALLS THE LARGEST TAX BILL IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.
THAT'S NOT TRUE, THE 18th 
LARGEST IN THE LAST CENTURY, 
ABOUT 1% OF GDP.
NO QUESTION, THIS IS A MAJOR 
LEGISLATIVE VICTORY FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 
REPUBLICANS.
YOU SEE MITCH McCONNELL RIGHT 
THERE.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT AS 
HE SPEAKED, AND MARY, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS HAD A ROUGH 
RELATIONSHIP WITH REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS OVER THE LAST YEAR.
THEY REALLY DIDN'T SUPPORT HIM 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
BUT THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY A 
MAJOR TAX CUT, ONE OF THEIR 
MAJOR GOALS, BUT AS THE 
PRESIDENT SAID, IT OPENS UP THE 
ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE 
TO DRILLING AND THEY GOT AT 
LEAST A PIECE OF THE REPEAL OF 
OBAMACARE.
>> NO SIGNS OF THAT FRAUGHT 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS
THERE.
AS THE PRESIDENT DID MENTION, 
IT'S ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN WHEN 
YOU WIN.
AND THIS IS A BIG SUBSTANTIAL 
WIN HERE FOR REPUBLICANS.
THE FIRST MAJOR LEGISLATIVE 
VICTORY OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY.
AND LOOK, IT DELIVERS IN SOME 
WAYS ON WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
PROMISING.
MOST AMERICANS WILL SEE A TAX 
CUT AT FIRST.
THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF 
WITH NEARLY UNANIMOUS REPUBLICAN
SUPPORT HERE.
NO REPUBLICAN NO VOTES IN THE 
SENATE.
BUT GEORGE, NOW THE CHALLENGE IS
TRANSLATING THIS INTO A 
POLITICAL WIN.
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO GET OUT 
THERE AND SELL THIS BILL.
IT'S DEEPLY UNPOPULAR.
CRITICS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER 
IT WILL DO WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE 
PROMISING IT WILL DO IN THE LONG
TERM.
OF COURSE, IT'S GOING TO PUT A 
MAJOR DENT IN THE DEFICIT.
REPUBLICANS KNOW IF THEY WANT 
THIS TO HELP THEM IN THE 2018 
MIDDERMS, THEY HAVE TO FIX THEIR
MESSAGING ON THIS ONE.
GET THE MESSAGE OUT.
IN FACT, I ASKED THE SPEAKER OF 
THE HOUSE THAT EXACT QUESTION, 
IF HE HAS CONCERNS THAT THIS 
WON'T ULTIMATELY BE VIEWED AS A 
WIN.
HE SAID NO, HE TOLD ME THE 
RESULTS ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS 
BILL POPULAR.
>> LET'S LISTEN TO THE SPEAKER 
RIGHT NOW.
>> FOR WHAT THEY DID IN GETTING 
US HERE.
I WANT TO THANK MY PARTNER MITCH
McCONNELL OVER IN THE SMAT FOR 
GETTING US TO WHERE THEY ARE, 
AND I WANT TO THANK ORRIN HATCH 
AND KEVIN BRADY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
LEADERSHIP ON THIS.
IT IS REALLY SIMPLE.
THE MESSAGE TO THE HARD WORKING 
TAXPAYERS OF AMERICA IS YOUR TAX
RELIEF IS ON ITS WAY.
THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
THE MESSAGE TO THE FAMILIES IN 
AMERICA WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, YOUR TAX 
RATES ARE GOING DOWN AND YOUR 
PAYCHECKS ARE GOING UP.
THIS IS THE KIND OF RELIEF 
AMERICANS DESERVE, THE KIND OF 
TAX CUTS THAT GET OUR ECONOMY 
GOING TO REACH ITS POTENTIAL.
THIS GETS US BETTER WAGES, 
BIGGER PAYCHECKS, A SIMPLER TAX 
SYSTEM.
THIS GETS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY 
COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL 
ECONOMY.
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THINGS WE COULD DO FOR
ALL OF THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT.
THIS IS GENERATIONAL.
AND WE'RE SO EXCITED THAT WE'RE 
GOING TO LAUNCH NEXT YEAR THIS 
FANTASTIC TAX REFORM SO THAT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE HOW WE 
CAN TRULY REACH OUR ECONOMIC 
GROWTH AND OUR ECONOMIC 
POTENTIAL AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR 
ALL THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MEN 
AND WOMEN UP HERE, THIS WOULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE.
LASTLY, I WANT TO THANK THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
I WANT TO THANK THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE FOR PUTTING THEIR TRUST 
IN US, FOR GIVING US THIS CHANCE
AND THIS ABILITY TO MAKE THIS 
MOMENT POSSIBLE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, PAUL 
RYAN.
BIG DAY FOR HIM AS WELL.
BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR QUITE A
LONG TIME.
>> A MAN WHO'S BEEN WORKING VERY
HARD.
THANK YOU, PAUL.
VERY, VERY HARD FOR A LONG 
PERIOD OF TIME, AND LAST NIGHT 
WAS VERY MUCH A CULMINATION, BUT
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL HAVE 
BIGGER MOMENTS, BUT WE HOPE TO.
WE'RE GOING TO TRY.
A VERY SPECIAL GUY AND GREAT 
FRIEND OF MINE, VICE PRESIDENT 
MIKE PENCE.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
THANK YOU FOR THOSE KIND WORDS.
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR BALANCED 
FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR 
PROMISE TO SEE THIS CONGRESS 
DELIVER THE LARGEST TAX CUT IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY BEFORE 
CHRISTMAS OF THIS YEAR.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, AMERICA.
TO MEMBERS OF OUR CABINET, TO 
LEADER McCONNELL, TO SPEAKER 
RYAN, TO ALL THESE MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU NOT ONLY FOR BEING 
HERE TODAY FOR THIS SPECIAL 
MOMENT, BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT 
THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR.
I TRULY DO BELIEVE, 
MR. PRESIDENT, THAT THIS WILL BE
REMEMBERED AS A PIVOTAL MOMENT 
IN THE LIFE OF OUR NATION.
A DAY WHEN THE CONGRESS ANSWERED
YOUR CALL AND MADE HISTORY.
BUT HONESTLY, I WOULD SAY TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE, PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS BEEN MAKING HISTORY SINCE 
THE FIRST DAY OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION.
WE'VE BEEN REBUILDING OUR 
MILITARY.
STANDING WITH OUR VETERANS.
AND JUST LAST WEEK, P PT. SIGNED
ONE OF THE LARGEST INVESTMENTS 
IN OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE SINCE 
THE DAYS OF RONALD REAGAN.
WE HAVE BEEN DEFENDING OUR 
BORDERS, UPHOLDING THE RULE OF 
LAW.
ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ON OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER ARE DOWN BY MORE
THAN 50%.
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN 
RESTORING AMERICAN CREDIBILITY 
ON THE WORLD STAGE.
STANDING WITH OUR ALLIES AND 
STANDING UP TO OUR ENEMIES.
AS THE PRESIDENT REFLECTED 
EARLIER TODAY, OUR NATO ALLIES 
ARE PAYING MORE TOWARD THEIR 
COMMON DEFENSE.
NORTH KOREA IS MORE ISOLATED 
THAN EVER BEFORE.
THIS PRESIDENT'S PUT IRAN ON 
NOTICE, AND PUT THE WAR ON 
AFGHANISTAN ON A PATH TO 
VICTORY.
AND THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF 
THIS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AND THE
COURAGE OF OUR ARMED FORCES, 
ISIS IS ON THE RUN.
THEIR CAPITAL HAS FALLEN.
AND THEIR SO-CALLED CALIPHATE 
HAS CRUMBLED ACROSS SYRIA AND 
IRAQ.
BUT WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY IS
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO KNOWS 
THAT AMERICAN STRENGTH STARTS 
WITH A GROWING AMERICAN ECONOMY.
AND FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, THIS PRESIDENT 
CHAMPIONED FREE AND FAIR TRADE.
HE ROLLED BACK FEDERAL RED TAPE 
AT RECORD LEVELS.
WE HAVE UNLEASHED AMERICAN 
ENERGY.
AND TODAY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 
HAVE FULFILLED THE PROMISE YOU 
MADE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS 
STRUGGLING IN THIS ECONOMY, TO 
CUT TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD.
FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND 
BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL.
IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR, THE 
PRESIDENT LAID OUT HIS VISION 
FOR A TAX CUT THAT WOULD BE A 
MIDDLE-CLASS MIRACLE.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE 
CONGRESS PASSED TODAY.
THIS IS GOING TO PUT MORE MONEY 
IN THE POCK LTS OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE.
IT WILL MAKE OUR TAX CODE MORE 
SIMPLE, MORE FAIR, MORE EASY TO 
UNDERSTAND.
IT WILL MAKEBEDSES ACROSS 
AMERICA MORE COMPETITIVE TO 
CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND 
RAISE WAGES.
I SERVE WITH HIM EVERY DAY.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN 
OF HIS WORD.
HE'S A MAN OF ACTION.
WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THESE
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP DELIVERED A GREAT 
VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE MADE HISTORY TODAY.
BUT AS THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN 
WE GATHERED THIS MORNING, A FEW 
OF US WITH A FEW LESS HOURS OF 
SLEEP THAN USUAL, WE'RE JUST 
GETTING STARTED.
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU, THIS 
PRESIDENT, THIS ENTIRE 
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT REST AND
RELENT UNTIL THE FORGOTTEN MEN 
AND WOMEN OF AMERICA ARE 
FORGOTTEN NO MORE.
SO THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE FOR THIS
COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS 
COUNTRY.
AND I KNOW IN MY HEART WITH THE 
STRONG CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THE 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO ARE 
GATHERED ON THESE STEPS AND WITH
GOD'S HELP, YOU WILL MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
>> VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE.
BIG VICTORY LAP HERE FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS ON THE SOUTH LAWN OF
THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
A FRIEND OF MINE, A VERY, VERY 
SPECIAL MAN, TIM SCOTT.
>> WITH THAT, WE'RE GOING TO 
SIGN OFF RIGHT NOW.
AGAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 
REPUBLICANS CELEBRATING THE 
PASSAGE OF THEIR MASSIVE $1.5 
TRILLION TAX CUT TODAY.
NOT SIGNED INTO LAW YET.
THAT'S LIKELY NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF 
THE YEAR, BUT IT'S PASSED THE 
HOUSE AND SENATE.
A MAJOR POLITICAL AND 
LEGISLATIVE VICTORY FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS.
WE'LL HAVE A FULL REPORT TONIGHT
ON "WORLD NEWS."
