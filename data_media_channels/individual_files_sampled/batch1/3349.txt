are there some things from your service that you can't shake so for example you still wake up at 4:30 in the morning to go work out what was it about your time in in the seals that you wanted to keep these habits up they're good habits why would you not wake up at 4:30 well what does this bring to you waking up early you just get a jump on the day the reason I wake up at 4:30 in the morning cuz no one else is awake yet so that gives me the opportunity to do things that I need to get done kind of selfishly for myself and the big one in that category is working out and it doesn't feel good at 4:30 when you get up but by the time 7 o'clock rolls around and you've already worked out you've already gotten some work done and you've got some time to say goodbye to your kids before they go to school it's infinitely better then sleeping in until 6:45 and you get out of bed and now you're doing missed your kids going to school or or whatever you you you're not prepared for the day it's it's awful so if someone maybe they do they don't have time to work out or they just need something that could be like a quick fix is there something that you recommend oh yeah workouts don't have to take a long time workouts can be very quick matter of fact go do two minutes of burpees as many purpose as you can in two minutes or four minutes or six minutes go and sprint go and do anything very intensely for a short period of time and you'll get great benefit out of it something I'm sure you hear a lot is 4:30 like this either just can't fit into my schedule or if I'm gonna be realistic I'm probably not gonna wake up at 4:30 and what do you tell people yeah and there's people that work night shifts and there's people that it's unhealthy for them they can't fall sick No be healthy get enough sleep but first of all wake up at the same time every day and if you picked that time and you start waking up at the same time every day that's very good for you it doesn't have to be 4:30 it could be 6:30 it could be 7 I don't know what your personal schedule is but find out a time pick it set it stick to it and maintain that schedule and that's gonna end up better for you I recommend its earlier I recommend that you go to bed earlier because what are you doing at night most of the time most the time at night you're not working on anything super productive you're just winding down and watching stupid YouTube videos or surfing the internet reading clickbait stories right don't do that instead go to sleep and then wake up early could you explain that notion of discipline equals freedom if you want more freedom in your life you have to have more discipline if you don't have any discipline you'll end up with absolutely no freedom you'll end up being a slave to other people that boss you around there's all kinds of problems that can occur if you don't have discipline in your life and the more discipline you have the more freedom you're gonna have so just that the discipline of the sales will never it's impossible to leave no it's possible to leave there's there's retired seals all over the place that are undisciplined they've moved on and they don't care about that anymore it's fine I don't judge other people on what they're doing like they're probably stoked to sleep in and hang out with their kids and eat breakfast in bed that's fine I don't have anything against that but for me I want to get up and go
