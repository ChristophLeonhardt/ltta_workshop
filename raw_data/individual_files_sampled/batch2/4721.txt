do you believe that what's happening in the Middle East with Israel with Iran is simply messaging or do you believe the Middle East is potentially on the brink of war well first it's good to be with you I think Israel will defend itself when it has it perceived a real risk and what Iran is doing getting closer and closer to the Israeli border through Syria Israel will not compromise its national security so I think what you're seeing here maybe more than messaging we hope it's not going to be a full-out conflict but I think Israel will continue to take steps to make sure that Iran does not have the capacity to affect Israel's security I want to play you what Republican congressman Carlos corbello said this morning about what should happen in Iran if the temperature is not ratcheted down a little bit listen we have to be willing to take military action if it gets to that point what does military action against Iran the play well that's not for me to decide that would be for generals and ultimately the president to decide but without question Iranian presence in Syria is disconcerting it's unacceptable and when they're firing missiles at our allies it becomes an issue that has to be dealt with very seriously so senator he is suggesting military action if tensions aren't ratcheted down do you agree should that happen next Israel has the full capacity to protect itself it's not asking for the u.s. help I think in this situation let's allow the Israelis to make the call what they think is necessary we have found in the Middle East that there are very few areas that were the military alone will solve a problem so this is not an area where we want to escalate a military conflict we want to make it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself and as we deal with the problems in Syria let's not give Iran a foothold in that country where they could attack other countries let me ask you about North Korea and the news overnight at what we saw at Joint Base Andrews what is the release of these detainees say to you well it's good news first of all whenever we can get Americans back home they're being held just for wrong reasons while their country's that's good news and get Americans out of North Korea as always good news it also shows that the communication is more constructive that we are able to use that means to release three Americans victory for President Trump it's a victory for the American people whenever we can get our people back home and we wanted the diplomacy to work in regards to eliminating the nuclear threat of North Korea so that's all very positive and it's under Donald Trump so absolutely we give him credit but the bottom line is let's make sure we use diplomacy to end this conflict in North Korea and as with the conflict in North Korea's the president looks ahead to these talks between himself and kim jungeun do you believe expectations are getting too high for these talks you heard the president say that it was nice that kim giman released it that he is taking these steps toward the discussions coming up in a matter of weeks does he need to ratchet down the expectation setting game let's be realistic as to what we can achieve in the short term it would be a major victory that we get a freeze on the North Korean nuclear program and we get inspectors on the ground knowing exactly what's going on and we have communications concerning the end of the nuclear program that's about that would be a major achievement in the short run senator very quickly before I let you go where are you on Jena Haspel do you support her as CIA director you know from here I'm going to what's known as a classified room asked if in order to look at the source material concerning her so I'm going to be reviewing that material and making a judgement very soon so you're still undecided Dianne Feinstein is a no I understand I wouldn't say I'm undecided I would say I'm not gonna make Nansen decision until you have looked at all the material all right well hope you come back on the show to talk about it senator ben cardin thank you for joining us on Capitol Hill hey there arm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
