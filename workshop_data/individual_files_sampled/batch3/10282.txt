Russia's ambassador to the UK has written to the policeman who was exposed to a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury following the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter Alexander iacovone Carnot commended officer Nick Bailey's bravery and wished him a speedy recovery with all the details let's get latest from madeira Tudor across this aisle Adira take us through what's happened in the events the letter to Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey thanking him for his actions following the poisoner it extended Moscow's best wishes and voiced hope the officer will make a full recovery and be able to return to a normal life as soon as possible it went on to express sincere gratitude for his bravery and in assurance that Russia had nothing to do with this reckless incident the investigation is ongoing and the OPCW the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons continues to investigate we've also heard from the head of the Ministry of Defense Research Lab Porton down you know we've got the highest levels of controls of security around the work that we do here we would not be allowed to operate if we had lack of control that could result in anything leaving the four walls of our facility here the Russian embassy has reacted to his comments saying that they amount to an admission that the secret facility is a place where new components of military-grade poisons are being researched and developed and that most notably Mr Aitken head did not deny the existence of chemical weapons stocks referring to the disputed possible sources of the nerve agent in question Moscow has openly condemned the attempted murders as an act of terrorism and denied any involvement despite that though it seems relations between the two countries are continuing to deteriorate and the situation doesn't look likely to get better anytime soon British PM Theresa May has rallied her European counterparts calling for a united front against Russia here's the head of the European Council we have different positions different interests it's also about you know different traditions is political landscape in Europe towards Russia and this is why it's not so easy to keep the twenty-eighth group together the Russian ambassador to the EU has now been summoned and told the decision will apparently be made on Monday with regards to what actions will be taken against Moscow if any from Moscow standpoint several attempts have been made to work together with the British authorities firstly following the incident at Russia says it's tried a number of times to ask for a joint investigation secondly Moscow says that it's requested a sample of the nerve agent again so that it can assist the UK's investigation and Russia has now also set up its own inquiry but how this will pan out is still unclear as no invitation can be completed without crucial information from UK authorities to date Britain has stuck to a hardline towards Russia with regards to the scribbler case it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attempted murder that took place on the streets of Salisbury the Russian denials grow increasingly people can concede is that this is a classic Russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation so what next for those of us watching this saga unfold all we know is that this investigation into the perpetrators and source of the nerve agent is going to take some time and in the meantime we can only watch to see who makes the next move
