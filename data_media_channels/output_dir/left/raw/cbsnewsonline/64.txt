1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:02,835
ADDED SIGNIFICANCE. 

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:06,639
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE SENATE 

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,475
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- PROTECT 

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,376
THE INDEPENDENCE OF BOB 

5
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:10,643
MUELLER. 

6
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,178
SEVERAL REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO 

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,881
WERE HERE TODAY SITED SCALIA'S 

8
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,282
DECENT TO JUSTIFY THEIR 

9
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,785
OPPOSITION TO A BILL PROTECTING 

10
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,286
THE SPECIAL COUNCIL WITH ONE 

11
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,588
EVEN SAYING AND I QUOTE, MANY 

12
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,191
OF US THINK WE ARE BOUND BY 

13
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:25,725
SCALIA'S DECENT. 

14
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,794
AT THE TIME, I JOKED AND SAID 

15
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:34,300
INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH STARRY 

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,567
DECISES. 

17
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,769
GIVEN YOUR VIEWS, WE ARE 

18
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,171
OBVIOUSLY WORRIED THAT YOU WILL 

19
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,042
FEEL BOUND BY THIS DECENT, BY 

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:42,975
ANTON SCALIA, IF PRESIDENT 

21
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,578
TRUMP DECIDES TO ATTEMPT TO 

22
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,413
FIRE THIS SPECIAL COUNCIL, BOB 

23
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:47,914
MUELLER. 

24
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,215
IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. 

25
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,384
YOU SITED SCALIA'S DECENT IN 

26
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,786
THE CASE INVOLVING THE CONSUMER 

27
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,788
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, 

28
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:58,624
WHERE YOU GUTTED THAT AGENCY. 

29
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,693
IN THE 2011 SKY CASE, YOU 

30
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,795
DESCENDED FROM A DECISION 

31
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:06,399
UPHOLDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE 

32
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:06,999
ACT, AND MADE BREATHTAKING -- 

33
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,101
WHICH HAS BEEN REPEATED OVER 

34
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,270
AND OVER AGAIN AND YOU SAID 

35
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,871
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, THE 

36
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,040
PRESIDENT MAY DECLINE TO 

37
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,475
ENFORCE A STATUTE THAT 

38
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,176
REGULATES PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS 

39
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,512
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DEEMS THE 

40
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,079
STATUTE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 

41
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,981
EVEN IF A COURT HAS HELD OR 

42
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:26,286
WOULD HOLD THE STATUTE 

43
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:26,886
CONSTITUTIONAL. 

44
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,186
YOUR WORDS. 

45
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,121
OF COURSE, THE UNITARY 

46
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,723
EXECUTIVE THEORY WAS THE BASIS 

47
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,892
FOR PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECEMBER 

48
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,227
30, 2005 SIGNING STATEMENT 

49
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,697
CLAIMING THE AUTHORITY TO 

50
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,300
OVERRIDE THE McCAIN TORTURE 

51
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,600
AMENDMENT. 

52
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,202
YESTERDAY, I ASKED WHAT 

53
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,270
COMMENTS YOU MADE AS PRESIDENT 

54
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,572
BUSH'S STAFF SECRETARY. 

55
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,506
SENATOR FEINSTEIN ASKED A 

56
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,308
SIMILAR QUESTION THIS MORNING. 

57
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,576
WHAT YOU TOLD ME WAS I CAN'T 

58
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,677
RECALL WHAT I SAID. 

59
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,012
I DO RECALL THERE WAS A GOOD 

60
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,214
DEAL INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THAT 

61
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,516
SIGNING STATEMENT, AS YOU CAN 

62
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:56,783
IMAGINE. 

63
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,320
I DO REMEMBER IT WOULD BE 

64
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,853
CONTROVERSIAL INTERNALLY. 

65
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,690
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE YOU CAN'T 

66
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,824
REMEMBER THAT CONTROVERSIAL 

67
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,057
ISSUE. 

68
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,393
GIVEN OUR CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR 

69
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,496
VIEWS ON EXECUTIVE POWER, IT'S 

70
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,898
IMPORTANT FOR YOU AT THIS 

71
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,199
MOMENT, PLEASE, TO CLARIFY FOR 

72
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,401
US THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY 

73
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,804
IN THIS AGE OF DONALD TRUMP. 

74
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:22,976
>>  SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

75
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,212
COMMENTS ABOUT MY WIFE AND 

76
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:26,512
DAUGHTERS. 

77
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:29,115
MY DAUGHTERS WILL RETURN THIS 

78
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:29,616
AFTERNOON. 

79
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,416
THEY WILL EXPERIENCE DEMOCRACY 

80
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,851
ONCE AGAIN IN ACTION. 

81
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:38,124
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. 

82
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,526
ON MORRISON VERSUS OLSON, A 

83
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,828
COUPLE THINGS AT THE OUTSET. 

84
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,230
FIRST, THAT CASE DID NOT 

85
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,566
INVOLVE THE SPECIAL COUNCIL 

86
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:46,799
SYSTEM. 

87
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,601
I HAVE WRITTEN REPEATEDLY, THAT 

88
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,003
THE TRADITIONAL SPECIAL COUNSEL 

89
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,405
SYSTEM, WHICH WE HAVE NOW, AND 

90
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,275
HAVE HAD HISTORICALLY, IS A 

91
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,976
DISTINCT SYSTEM APPOINTED BY 

92
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:57,643
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, MORRISON 

93
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:59,412
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. 

94
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,414
THAT DEALT WITH THE INDEPENDENT 

95
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,317
STATUTE, AS YOU SAID, WHICH IS 

96
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,220
EXPIRED IN 1999, UNDER 

97
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,323
OVERWELMING CONSENSUS, THAT 

98
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,158
STATUTE WAS INAPPROPRIATE, 

99
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,329
UNRESTRAINED, UNACCOUNTABLE, AS 

100
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,630
YOU SAID. 

101
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,001
SECONDLY, MORRISON, JUSTICE 

102
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,403
SCALIA, THAT DOES -- HUMPHREY'S 

103
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,872
EXECUTIVE IS THE SUPREME COURT 

104
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,373
PRECEDENT THAT ALLOWS 

105
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,508
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES TO EXIST. 

106
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,477
THOSE INDEPENDENT REGULATORY 

107
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,612
AGENCIES CONTINUE TO EXIST, OF 

108
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,814
COURSE, SO BOTH ON THE 

109
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,417
INDEPENDENT AGENCY SIDE, THOSE 

110
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:37,784
ARE UNAFFECTED. 

111
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:42,221
ON THE SPECIAL COUNSEL SIDE, 

112
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:42,654
THAT'S UNAFFECTED. 

113
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:47,493
YOU MENTIONED THE CFPB CASE. 

114
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,163
MY DECISION IN THAT CASE WOULD 

115
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,333
HAVE ALLOWED THAT AGENCY TO 

116
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,434
CONTINUE OPERATING AND 

117
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,336
PERFORMING IMPORTANT OPERATIONS 

118
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:56,869
FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS. 

119
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:57,870
THE ONLY CORRECTION WOULD HAVE 

120
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,671
BEEN IN THE STRUCTURE. 

121
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,674
IT WAS A NOVEL STRUCTURE UNLIKE 

122
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,276
ANY OTHER INDEPENDENT AGENCY 

123
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,510
THAT HAD BEEN CREATED 

124
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:04,810
PREVIOUSLY. 

125
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:13,620
AS TO THE CONCEPT OF PROSECUTE 

126
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,555
DISCRETION, THAT IS RECOGNIZED 

127
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,555
IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 

128
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,125
THE LIMITS ARE UNCERTAIN. 

129
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,462
THAT'S RISEN IN THE IMMIGRATION 

130
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,629
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. 

131
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,231
THERE ARE DEBATES ABOUT WHAT 

132
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,933
THE LIMITS ARE. 

133
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,833
THE BASIC CONCEPT OF DISCRETION 

134
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,604
IS ALL I WAS REFERRING TO 

135
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,004
THERE. 

136
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:35,375
I'VE MADE CLEAR IN MY WRITINGS, 

137
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,877
THAT A COURT ORDER THAT 

138
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,213
REQUIRES A PRESIDENT TO DO 

139
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,814
SOMETHING OR PROHIBITS A 

140
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,716
PRESIDENT FROM DOING SOMETHING 

141
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,117
UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS 

142
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:48,020
OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE 

143
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,423
FINAL WORD IN OUR SYSTEM. 

144
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,657
OUR SEPARATION OF POWER SYSTEM. 

145
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:54,259
WHICH IS COOPER VERSUS AARON. 

146
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:58,231
THAT IS UNITED STATES VERSUS 

147
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,064
RICHARD NIXON. 

148
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:03,236
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE. 

149
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,303
FINALLY, THE QUESTION OF WHO 

150
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:06,305
CONTROLS THE EXECUTIVE POWER 

151
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,807
WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, 

152
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,108
THE VERTICAL QUESTION, YOU HAVE 

153
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,911
THE PRESIDENT AT THE TOP. 

154
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,246
YOU HAVE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES, 

155
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,314
WHICH EXIST WITH PRECEDENT, IS 

156
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,015
DISTINCT FROM THE QUESTION OF 

157
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,118
WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE 

158
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:19,518
EXECUTIVE POWER. 

159
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:22,021
ON THAT LADDER QUESTION, THE 

160
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,623
SCOPE OF EXECUTIVE POWER, I 

161
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,591
HAVE MADE CLEAR, AND THE 

162
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,027
CONTEXT OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 

163
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,630
THE YOUNGSTOWN FRAMEWORK, 

164
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,533
CONTEXT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, 

165
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,734
MY CASES QUESTIONING UNILATERAL 

166
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,835
EXECUTIVE REWRITING OF THE LAW. 

167
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,504
IN THE CRIMINAL LAW, WHERE I 

168
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,906
REVERSED CONVICTIONS, I AM ONE 

169
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,810
NOT AFRAID AT ALL THROUGH MY 

170
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,946
RECORD OF 12 YEARS TO 

171
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:47,546
INVALIDATE EXECUTIVE POWER. 

172
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:51,050
>>  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 

173
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,452
YOU REFERRED TO THE YOUNGSTOWN 

174
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:52,652
CASE. 

175
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,153
IN THE CONTEXT OF A WAR AND A 

176
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,057
DECISION BY A WAR THAT WAS 

177
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,959
UNPOPULAR, AND THE DECISION, OR 

178
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,760
MIGHT HAVE BEEN POPULAR, I 

179
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,663
SHOULD SAY, AND THE DECISION OF 

180
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,130
THE SUPREME COURT WHICH WAS 

181
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,266
UNPOPULAR AT THAT MOMENT IN 

182
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:07,667
HISTORY. 

183
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,569
WHAT I'M TRYING TO ASK YOU IS 

184
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:11,838
IN HISTORIC CONTEXT, DO YOU 

185
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,205
UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE NOW? 

186
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:15,241
WHEN BOOKS ARE BEING WRITTEN, 

187
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,810
HOW DEMOCRACY DIES, WHEN FEAR 

188
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,844
OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE AND CAN 

189
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,146
THE EXPANSION OF THE EXECUTIVE 

190
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,548
BRANCH IS RAMPANT IN THIS 

191
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,449
COUNTRY, WHEN ILLUSTRATIONS OF 

192
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,884
IT ARE FOUND AROUND THE WORLD, 

193
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:28,254
WHY WE ARE ASKING YOU OVER AND 

194
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,157
OVER AGAIN, GIVE US SOME 

195
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,558
REASSURANCE ABOUT YOUR 

196
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,027
COMMITMENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC 

197
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,662
INSTITUTIONS OF THIS COUNTRY IN 

198
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,831
THE FACE OF A PRESIDENT WHO 

199
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,733
SEEMS PREPARED TO CAST THEM 

200
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,267
ASIDE. 

201
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,235
WHETHER IT'S VOTER SUPPRESSION, 

202
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,237
THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA, CASE 

203
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,938
AFTER CASE, WE HEAR THIS 

204
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,707
PRESIDENT WILLING TO WALK AWAY 

205
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,643
FROM THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS 

206
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,210
COUNTRY. 

207
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,344
THAT'S THE HISTORIC CONTEXT, 

208
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,011
WHICH THIS IS IN. 

209
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,315
NOT A PARTICULAR CASE, BUT A 

210
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:56,949
PARTICULAR MOMENT IN HISTORY. 

211
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,553
>>  MY 12 YEAR RECORD SHOWS AND 

212
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,655
MY STATEMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE 

213
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,261
SHOW AND ALL MY TEACHING AND 

214
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,263
ARTICLES SHOW MY COMMITMENT TO 

215
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,565
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 

216
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,335
JUDICIARY, AS THE CROWN JEWEL 

217
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,638
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. 

218
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,107
MY SITING OF JUSTICE KENNEDY 

219
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:21,707
FOR WHOM I WORKED. 

220
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,409
WHO LEFT US A LEGACY OF 

221
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,944
LIBERTY, BUT ALSO A LEGACY OF 

222
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,679
ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN 

223
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,649
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

224
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,151
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW IN THE 

225
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:32,518
UNITED STATES. 

226
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,653
THAT'S A FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE 

227
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,222
THAT I TALKED ABOUT COMING FROM 

228
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,158
FEDERAL OF 69, COMING FROM THE 

229
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:39,491
CONSTITUTION. 

230
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:40,425
WE'RE ALL EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW 

231
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,262
IN THE UNITED STATES OF 

232
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:43,529
AMERICA. 

233
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,466
AND I MADE CLEAR MY DEEP FAITH 

234
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,769
IN THE JUDICIARY. 

235
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,438
THE JUDICIARY HAS BEEN THE 

236
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,940
FINAL GUARANTOR OF THE RULE OF 

237
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,140
LAW. 

238
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,142
AS I SAID IN MY OPENING, THE 

239
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,009
SUPREME COURT IS THE LAST LINE 

240
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,781
OF DEFENSE FROM THE SEPARATION 

241
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,082
OF POWERS BY THE LAWS OF THE 

242
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:03,449
UNITED STATES. 

243
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,152
>>  YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY THE 

244
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:12,225
UNITARY THEORY OF THE EXECUTIVE 

245
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:12,958
IS SO WORRISOME. 

246
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,961
WHAT YOU SAID IS WHAT I WANT TO 

247
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,562
HEAR, FROM A COEQUAL AND 

248
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,763
IMPORTANT BRANCH OF OUR 

249
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,063
GOVERNMENT. 

250
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,166
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IN 

251
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,968
RELATION TO MORRISON SUGGESTS 

252
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:22,868
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE LAST 

253
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:23,068
WORD. 

254
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:25,137
>>  I HAVE NOT SAID THAT, 

255
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,640
SENATOR, AND I WILL REITERATE 

256
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,342
SOMETHING I SAID A MINUTE AGO 

257
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,311
COMING FROM COOPER VERSUS 

258
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,880
AARON, COMING FROM MARBURRY, 

259
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,682
WHEN A COURT ORDER REQUIRES A 

260
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,884
PRESIDENT TO DO SOMETHING OR 

261
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,318
PROHIBITS A PRESIDENT FROM 

262
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,188
DOING SOMETHING UNDER THE 

263
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,856
CONSTITUTION LAWS OF THE UNITED 

264
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,391
STATES, UNDER OUR 

265
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,959
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, THAT IS 

266
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,326
THE FINAL WORD. 

267
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,797
>>  LET ME ASK YOU ONE LAST 

268
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:51,997
TIME. 

269
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:54,000
THE QUESTION YOU KNEW I'D ASK 

270
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,137
ABOUT YOUR TESTIMONY IN 2006. 

271
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,572
I AM STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT 

272
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:04,276
THAT WHEN I ASK YOU ABOUT THIS 

273
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:05,144
ISSUE OF DETENTION, 

274
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,880
INTERROGATION, AND TORTURE, YOU 

275
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,982
GAME SUCH A SIMPLE DECLARATIVE 

276
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,118
ANSWER TO ME AND SAID THAT I 

277
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,786
WAS NOT INVOLVED AND I'M NOT 

278
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,588
INVOLVED IN THE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

279
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,291
THE RULES GOVERNING DETENTION 

280
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,192
OF COMBATANTS. 

281
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,461
WE HAVE FOUND THREE SPECIFIC 

282
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,297
EXAMPLES WHERE YOU WERE. 

283
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:25,530
THREE. 

284
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,299
YOUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE 

285
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,202
ACCESS TO COUNSEL FOR 

286
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:30,636
DETAINEES. 

287
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,872
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASES, AND 

288
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,539
YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH PRESIDENT 

289
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,641
BUSH'S SIGNING STATEMENT ON THE 

290
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,675
McCAIN TORTURE AMENDMENT. 

291
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,578
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU SAY THAT 

292
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:38,945
WORDS MATTER. 

293
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:43,983
YOU CLAIM TO BE A -- BUT YOU 

294
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,685
DON'T WANT TO BE HELD 

295
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,485
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PLAIN 

296
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,120
MEANING OF YOUR OWN WORDS. 

297
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,691
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR YOU 

298
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,793
TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR RESPONSE TO 

299
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,294
THE QUESTION AND ACKNOWLEDGE 

300
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,963
THAT AT LEAST YOUR ANSWER WAS 

301
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,031
MISLEADING, IF NOT WRONG. 

302
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,400
>>  SENATOR, YOU HAD A CONCERN 

303
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,903
AT THE TIME OF THE 2006 

304
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,272
HEARING, WHICH WAS 

305
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:06,672
UNDERSTANDABLE. 

306
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:11,677
WHETHER I HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN 

307
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,212
CRAFTING THE POLICIES, 

308
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,413
INTERROGATION POLICIES, THAT 

309
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,981
WERE SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT THE 

310
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:16,716
LEGAL MEMOS HAD BEEN WRITTEN 

311
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,285
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

312
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,456
THAT WERE VERY  CONTROVERSIAL. 

313
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,690
AS YOU KNEW, TWO JUDICIAL 

314
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,525
NOMINEES TO THE COURTS OF 

315
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,794
APPEALS HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN 

316
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,231
WORKING ON SOME OF THE MEMOS 

317
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:36,235
RELATED TO THAT PROGRAM. 

318
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,971
SENATOR FEINSTEIN LED THE 

319
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,471
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 

320
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:43,242
INVESTIGATION OF THAT MATTER. 

321
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,777
PRODUCED A MASSIVE REPORT. 

322
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,812
LARGE UNCLASSIFIED REPORT AND 

323
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,382
APPARENTLY, EVEN LARGER 

324
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:50,815
CLASSIFIED REPORT. 

325
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:53,986
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICE 

326
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,687
OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 

327
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,088
PRODUCED A LONG REPORT ABOUT 

328
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,424
ALL THE LAWYERS WHO ARE 

329
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:58,690
INVOLVED. 

330
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,792
I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN CRAFTING. 

331
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:04,563
>>  YOU DO DENY BEING INVOLVED 

332
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,565
IN THE THREE AREAS, WHICH I 

333
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,299
JUST READ TO YOU? 

334
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,302
DO YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD NOTHING 

335
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,972
TO DO WITH THE PADILLA CASES, 

336
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,273
THAT YOU WEREN'T INVOLVED IN 

337
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,676
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ACCESS 

338
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,778
TO COUNSEL FOR DETAINEES, YOU 

339
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,012
WEREN'T INVOLVED IN PRESIDENT 

340
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,214
BUSH'S DECISION ON A SIGNING 

341
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,616
STATEMENT ON THE TORTURE 

342
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:23,916
AMENDMENT. 

343
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,317
ARE YOU SAYING NONE OF THOSE 

344
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:25,818
THINGS OCCURRED? 

345
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,319
>>  WHAT I MADE CLEAR IS I 

346
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,354
UNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION THEN 

347
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:35,094
AND KY  -- I STILL UNDERSTAND 

348
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,394
IT NOW. 

349
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,596
TO BE ABOUT THOSE LEGAL MEMOS. 

350
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,898
I WAS NOT READ INTO THAT 

351
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:39,498
PROGRAM. 

352
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,198
I WAS NOT INVOLVED. 

353
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:43,002
MY NAME DOES NOT APPEAR IN 

354
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,569
SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S REPORT. 

355
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,071
>>  THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION I 

356
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:46,304
ASKED. 

357
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,073
DO YOU DENY THE THREE SPECIFIC 

358
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,075
INSTANCES WHERE YOU WERE 

359
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,077
INVOLVED IN QUESTIONS INVOLVING 

360
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:52,711
DETENTION AND INTERROGATION? 

361
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,014
>>  THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT 

362
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,683
I SAW THAT YOU ASKED AT THE 

363
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,585
TIME OF THAT HEARING. 

364
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,588
AND MY ANSWER WAS THEN AND IS 

365
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,024
NOW, AS SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S 

366
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,526
REPORT SHOWS AND AS THE 

367
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,093
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 

368
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,095
REPORT SHOWS, I WAS NOT READ 

369
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:10,528
INTO THAT PROGRAM. 

370
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:17,903
>>  I DIDN'T ASK YOU ABOUT THAT 

371
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,170
PROGRAM. 

372
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,872
>>  FEINSTEIN IS MY DEFENSE, 

373
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,273
SHE CAME TO MY RESCUE. 

374
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,008
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING 

375
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:23,208
ELSE. 

376
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,977
I ASKED YOU ABOUT THREE 

377
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,912
SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHERE WE 

378
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,847
HAVE WRITTEN PROOF AND SWORN 

379
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,715
TESTIMONY FROM EWE NOW THAT YOU 

380
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,317
WERE INVOLVED IN THESE THREE 

381
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,419
THINGS, ALL OF THEM RELATE TO 

382
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,119
DETENTION AND INTERROGATION, 

383
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,322
WHEN YOU GAVE ME YOUR ASSURANCE 

384
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:36,956
YOU WEREN'T INVOLVED IN. 

385
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,158
>>  SENATOR, I'M GOING TO 

386
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,058
DISTINGUISH TWO THINGS. 

387
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:43,329
ONE, WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ME IN 

388
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,630
2006 AND MY TESTIMONY THEN WAS 

389
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,432
ACCURATE AND WAS THE TRUTH. 

390
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,200
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME NOW IS, 

391
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,202
FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE SIGNING 

392
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,672
STATEMENT, AS WE DISCUSSED IN 

393
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,673
YOUR OFFICE. 

394
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,276
I MADE CLEAR THAT, OF COURSE, 

395
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:57,943
AS STAFF SECRETARY, EVERYTHING 

396
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,378
THAT WENT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR 

397
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,914
A THREE YEAR PERIOD, WITH A FEW 

398
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,816
COVERT EXCEPTIONS WOULD HAVE 

399
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,520
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY FROM 

400
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,221
THE COUNCIL'S OFFICE, OR THE 

401
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,323
POLICY ADVISER, OR WHEREVER IT 

402
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,224
WAS GOING, AND WOULD HAVE MADE 

403
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,326
ITS WAY TO THE PRESIDENT'S 

404
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:14,627
DESK. 

405
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,227
THAT INCLUDES THAT SIGNING 

406
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:15,528
STATEMENT. 

407
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,528
>>  LET ME CLOSE. 

408
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,230
I DON'T THINK THE STAFF 

409
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,632
SECRETARY TO THE UNITED STATES 

410
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,066
PRESIDENT IS A FILE CLERK. 

411
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,568
WHAT YOU HAVE EXPLAINED TO US 

412
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,204
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THIS WAS A 

413
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,272
MOMENT IN YOUR PUBLIC CAREER. 

414
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:28,807
YOU WERE GIVEN CONSTITUTIONAL 

415
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,710
ISSUE ADVICE AS WELL AS MAKING 

416
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,312
CHANGES IN DRAFTS THAT WERE 

417
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,613
HEADED FOR THE PRESIDENT'S 

418
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:34,813
DESK. 

419
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,917
AND ONE OF THEM INVOLVED JOHN 

420
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,750
McCAIN'S TORTURE AMENDMENT. 

421
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,554
THAT TO ME IS INVOLVED DIRECTLY 

422
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:46,458
ON DETENTION AND INTERROGATION. 

423
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,426
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY -- 

424
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,129
>>  SPEAK TO THAT, THEN WE'LL 

425
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,933
GO TO SENATOR LEE. 

426
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,035
>>  IN RESPONSE TO HIS 

427
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,036
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JUDICIARY, 

428
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,504
THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY, HE 

429
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:06,278
GAVE ME A BOOK WHEN WE MET, 

430
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:06,778
BIOGRAPHY OF JOHNSON. 

431
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,315
AFTER A LOT OF SENATE MEETINGS 

432
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:09,815
AND PRACTICE SESSIONS. 

433
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,051
I WENT HOME AND READ THE WHOLE 

434
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:12,318
THING. 

435
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,019
AND I APPRECIATE IT. 

436
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,954
IT'S A GOOD MODEL. 

437
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:16,455
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. 

438
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,723
IT'S A GREAT STORY ABOUT 

439
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,325
SOMEONE WHO WAS A JUDGE IN THE 

440
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,293
SOUTH, IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA 

441
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,128
WHO STOOD FIRM FOR THE RULE OF 

442
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,330
LAW. 

443
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,632
A GOOD MODEL. 

444
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,533
I THANK SENATOR DURBIN FOR 

445
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,734
GIVING ME THE BOOK. 

446
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,803
>>  THANK YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

447
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,104
THE NATIONALS WEREN'T PLAYING 

448
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:32,404
THAT NIGHT. 

449
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:38,610
>>  YES.

450
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,245
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS 

451
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:43,148
TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS. 

452
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,516
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS 

453
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,653
LAST LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM 

454
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,020
SENATOR DURBIN. 

455
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,622
SENATOR DURBIN AND I, 

456
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,456
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT WE 

457
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,293
COME FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF 

458
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,462
THE COUNTRY, WE SHARE MANY 

459
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,331
VIEWS IN COMMON, AND THIS IS 

460
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,633
ONE AREA, INDEFINITE DETENTION, 

461
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,736
WHERE HE AND I ARE CONCERNED 

462
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,904
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT NOT OVER 

463
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,305
REACHING. 

464
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,708
ONLY AS I LOOK AT THIS, I THINK 

465
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,345
THIS CUTS INTO YOUR FAVOR, NOT 

466
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:13,678
AGAINST YOU. 

467
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:16,148
TELL ME IF I AM MISSING 

468
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:16,448
SOMETHING. 

469
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,950
IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHAT YOU 

470
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,650
WERE ASKED ABOUT WAS WHETHER OR 

471
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,853
NOT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN 

472
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,955
CRAFTING THE POLICIES THAT 

473
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:27,159
WOULD GOVERN DETENTION OF ENEMY 

474
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,293
COMBATANTS, IS THAT CORRECT? 

475
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:28,893
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

476
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:32,631
>>  THAT WAS A CLASSIFIED 

477
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,534
PROGRAM, CLASSIFIED AT A HIGH 

478
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,036
LEVEL, SUCH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE 

479
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,604
HAD TO HAVE BEEN READ INTO THAT 

480
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,272
PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE 

481
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,773
IN THAT PROCESS. 

482
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:42,140
IS THAT RIGHT? 

483
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,245
>>  I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT. 

484
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:47,846
READ IN. 

485
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,913
I WASN'T NECESSARILY USING THE 

486
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:50,082
FORMAL SENSE OF THAT. 

487
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,950
WHAT I MEANT IS, I WAS NOT PART 

488
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,717
OF THAT PROGRAM. 

489
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,553
>>  OKAY. 

490
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,189
THAT IS A BINARY ISSUE. 

491
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,590
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE 

492
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,858
DEVELOPMENT OF THAT POLICY OR 

493
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:00,225
YOU WERE NOT. 

494
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,226
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

495
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,060
>> AND YOU WERE NOT. 

496
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,061
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

497
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:06,932
>>  AND TIM FLANIGAN, WHO WAS 

498
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,465
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL. 

499
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,502
>>  HE WAS THE DEPUTY COUNCIL. 

500
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,037
>>  HAS CONFIRMED YOU WERE NOT 

501
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:12,638
INVOLVED IN THAT. 

502
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,940
WE HAVE YOUR WORD AND THE WORD 

503
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,479
OF THE THEN DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE 

504
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,745
COUNCIL. 

505
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,981
THEN, THERE IS A SEPARATE 

506
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,214
ISSUE. 

507
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:25,384
I GUESS ONE COULD ARGUE A 

508
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,519
RELATED ISSUE. 

509
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,359
A SEPARATE ISSUE -- 

510
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,594
>>  I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORTH 

511
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,863
IT, HE SAID I'M NOT READ INTO 

512
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:38,029
IT. 

513
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:38,797
I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE 

514
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:43,569
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. 

515
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:01,386
>>  I ASSUME THAT WON'T BE 

516
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:02,053
COUNTED AGAINST ME. 

517
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,289
I'LL HAVE TO SPEAK MORE 

518
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:04,556
QUICKLY. 

519
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,290
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BEING READ 

520
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,694
INTO, THAT IS A TERM WE 

521
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,362
SOMETIMES REFER TO AS 

522
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,997
GOVERNMENT SPEAK, THAT TALKS 

523
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,566
ABOUT BEING CLEARED TO DISCUSS 

524
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,867
CERTAIN CLASSIFIED MATTERS. 

525
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,301
IN ANY EVENT, YOU WERE NOT 

526
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,102
BROUGHT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF 

527
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:18,435
THIS POLICY. 

528
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,137
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

529
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:24,542
>>  SECONDLY, THERE WAS A 

530
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,878
SEPARATE ARGUABLY RELATED, BUT 

531
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:27,980
A DISTINCT ISSUE INVOLVING A 

532
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,183
MEETING WHERE YOU WERE ASKED 

533
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,186
FOR YOUR OPINION ABOUT HOW 

534
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,588
JUSTICE KENNEDY MIGHT REACT TO 

535
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,489
CERTAIN LEGAL ARGUMENTS THAT 

536
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,192
PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION 

537
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:40,525
WERE PUSHING. 

538
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:40,892
IS THAT RIGHT? 

539
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:41,393
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

540
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,262
>>  YOU ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. 

541
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,498
>>  I SAID THAT INDEFINITE DI 

542
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,668
TENSION OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 

543
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,304
WITHOUT ACCESS TO A LAWYER, 

544
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:56,141
WHICH AT THE TIME, WAS 

545
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,609
HAPPENING IN THAT PARTICULAR 

546
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,480
CASE, WOULD NEVER FLY WITH 

547
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,880
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 

548
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,082
>>  AND I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH 

549
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:04,783
YOU ON THAT. 

550
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,554
IT SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY 

551
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,554
UNREMARKABLE PROPOSITION TO ME. 

552
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,191
I DON'T THINK ANYONE DISPUTES 

553
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,293
THAT ARGUMENT HAD PROBLEMS WITH 

554
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:14,493
IT. 

555
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,397
THAT ARGUMENT WOULDN'T FLY WITH 

556
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:18,797
JUSTICE KENNEDY. 

557
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,298
AND I THEREFORE HAVE DIFFICULTY 

558
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,801
SEEING HOW THIS CUTS AGAINST 

559
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,502
YOU. 

560
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,137
AS SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN 

561
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,638
CIVIL LIBERTIES AND SHARES MANY 

562
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,173
OF THE SAME CONCERNS THAT HAVE 

563
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,978
BEEN EXPRESSED BY MANY OF MY 

564
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:33,478
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES. 

565
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:34,413
THE ADVICE WAS ACCURATE. 

566
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:39,985
I BELIEVE IT WAS GOOD ADVICE. 

567
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,086
IT CERTAINLY IS NOT 

568
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,689
INCONSISTENT WITH THE STATEMENT 

569
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,022
YOU PROVIDED. 

570
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,591
WHICH WAS THAT YOU WERE NOT 

571
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,992
INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 

572
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,494
THE POLICY GOVERNING THE 

573
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:49,761
PROGRAM. 

574
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,495
SOMETIMES AS LAWYERS, WE'RE 

575
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,332
CALLED UPON TO OFFER LITIGATION 

576
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:53,699
STRATEGY. 

577
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,901
SOMETIMES WE'RE CALLED UPON TO 

578
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:56,334
HANDLE LITIGATION. 

579
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,402
OTHER TIMES, AS LAWYERS IN THE 

580
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,803
GOVERNMENT, WE MIGHT BE CALLED 

581
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,206
UPON TO DEVELOP A POLICY. 

582
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,975
HERE, YOU WERE NEITHER INVOLVED 

583
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,543
IN DEVELOPING THE POLICY OR 

584
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,143
HANDLING IT DIRECTLY. 

585
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:08,213
YOU WENT TO A MEETING, SOMEONE 

586
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,414
ASKED THE QUESTION, YOU GAVE 

587
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:09,714
THE ANSWER. 

588
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:12,117
>>  IT WAS ABOUT SOMETHING 

589
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:12,918
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT 

590
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,218
POLICY. 

591
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,520
>>  SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM 

592
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:15,853
THAT POLICY. 

593
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:18,290
IT WAS ABOUT A LITIGATING 

594
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,791
POSITION THAT DEALT SORT OF IN 

595
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,927
THE SAME UNIVERSE, BUT NOT WITH 

596
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:22,260
THAT POLICY. 

597
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,161
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 

598
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,797
>>  I THEREFORE HAVE GRAVE 

599
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,698
DIFFICULTY IN SEEING YOU DID 

600
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,200
ANYTHING BUT THE RIGHT THING 

601
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,335
AND YOU ANSWERED THIS QUESTION 

602
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,870
IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN WITH THE 

603
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,604
TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND 

604
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,105
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. 

605
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,575
LET ME TURN NEXT, WHILE WE'RE 

606
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,477
TALKING ABOUT COLLEAGUES WITH 

607
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,111
WHOM I OFTEN AGREE AND WITH 

608
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,814
WHOM I OFTEN WORK ACROSS THE 

609
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,047
AISLE. 

610
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,048
SENATOR BOOKER IS A GOOD FRIEND 

611
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,418
OF MINE AND HE IS A COLLEAGUE. 

612
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,021
HE AND I WORK TOGETHER ON A LOT 

613
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,321
OF ISSUES. 

614
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,522
HE RAISED AN ISSUE LAST NIGHT 

615
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,793
THAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON WITH 

616
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,127
YOU. 

617
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,029
HE RAISED AN ISSUE RELATED TO 

618
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,629
SOME E-MAILS. 

619
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:58,530
I WAS CONCERNED AT THE TIME 

620
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,931
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE E-

621
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,200
MAILS IN FRONT OF YOU. 

622
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,503
AND I THINK THAT'S VERY 

623
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,805
IMPORTANT FOR ANY WITNESS IN 

624
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,307
ANY PROCEEDING TO BE GIVEN 

625
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,075
ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS. 

626
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,342
DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PREPARED 

627
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,477
SOME 18 YEARS AGO. 

628
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,813
YOU, AS A LAWYER, HAVE NO DOUBT 

629
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,215
BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CREATION 

630
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,216
OF HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS, 

631
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,117
POSSIBLY MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS 

632
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,719
TO ASK YOU TO RECALL FROM 

633
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,820
MEMORY SOMETHING YOU WROTE 18 

634
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,323
YEARS AGO IS GOING TO BE 

635
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,226
DIFFICULT AT ANY MOMENT. 

636
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:32,230
IN ANY EVENT, THESE E-MAILS 

637
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,399
DEAL WITH AN ISSUE INVOLVING 

638
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,801
SOME QUESTIONS SURROUNDING 

639
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,770
SUPREME COURT CASE CALLED 

640
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,906
ADARAND CON INSTRUCTORS VERSUS 

641
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,173
MANETTA. 

642
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:47,813
SO LET'S REFER TO A DOCUMENT  

643
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,213
OO289596. 

644
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,649
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOU WERE 

645
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,418
BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE SOME 

646
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,723
ADVICE ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF 

647
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,623
A PARTICULAR ARGUMENT WERE 

648
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,225
PRESENTED TO THE SUPREME COURT 

649
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,159
ON THE MERITS. 

650
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,596
YOU LOOKED AT SOME DEPARTMENT 

651
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,732
OF TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTING 

652
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:07,065
REGULATIONS. 

653
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,301
AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT, CORRECT 

654
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,104
ME IF I'M WRONG, IF I 

655
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,507
UNDERSTOOD IT CORRECTLY, THE 

656
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,174
GOVERNMENT WAS CONSIDERING 

657
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,210
MAKING A SERIES OF ARGUMENTS 

658
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,277
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND 

659
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:21,413
YOU DID WHAT A GOOD LAWYER 

660
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,914
SHOULD DO WHEN ADVANCING AN 

661
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,949
ARGUMENT TO THE COURT. 

662
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:27,118
YOU COUNTED TO FIVE. 

663
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:29,020
YOU IDENTIFIED FIVE SUPREME 

664
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,522
COURT JUSTICES WHO YOU BELIEVED 

665
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,125
WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE 

666
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:41,933
GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT THE 

667
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,437
PRECEDENT THAT EXISTED AT THE 

668
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,070
TIME, THE CROSON PRECEDENT WAS 

669
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,671
THE MOST RELEVANT PRECEDENT. 

670
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,273
>> YET AT THE TIME THE SUPREME 

671
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,841
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD 

672
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,277
ALREADY GRANTED REVIEW OF THE 

673
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,879
CASE, MEANING THE SUPREME COURT 

674
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:58,517
UNLIKE MOST APPELLATE COURTS IS 

675
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:03,555
IN CHARGE WITH VERY, VERY FEW 

676
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,489
EXCEPTIONS REMAINING TODAY OF 

677
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,824
ITS OWN DOCKETS, IT DECIDES THE 

678
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:15,400
10,000 OR SO CASES THAT GO TO 

679
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,268
SUPREME COURT EVERY YEAR 

680
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,603
>> I READ YOUR ARGUMENT AS 

681
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,639
SAYING, NUMBER ONE, YOU CANNOT 

682
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,209
COUNT TO FIVE HERE BECAUSE I'M 

683
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,377
IDENTIFYING, I BRETT KAVANAUGH 

684
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,213
HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE 

685
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,315
GREAT DOUBTS AS CHIEF JUSTICE 

686
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,584
RENQUIST, SCALIA, KENNEDY OR 

687
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,184
JUSTICE O'CONNOR CAN EMBRACE 

688
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:36,221
THESE ARGUMENTS IN DEFENSE OF 

689
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,990
THESE DEPARTMENT OF 

690
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,557
TRANSPORTATION REGULATIONS. 

691
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,293
BUT THE COURT HAS ALREADY 

692
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,694
GRANTED SIRSORI, SO WHAT TO DO? 

693
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,528
AS I UNDERSTAND THE E-MAILS, 

694
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,362
AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, 

695
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,164
YOU RECOMMENDED A COURSE OF 

696
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,165
ACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE 

697
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,300
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE ITS CASE BUT 

698
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,369
TO MAKE ITS INDICATION IN A WAY 

699
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,270
THAT IT WOULD ALLOW THE COURT 

700
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,439
TO DECIDE THAT PERHAPS IT 

701
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,073
SHOULDN'T HAVE GRANTED REVIEW 

702
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:55,406
IN THE CASE. 

703
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,076
AM I CORRECT SO FAR? 

704
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:58,676
>> THAT'S CORRECT, SENATOR. 

705
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,311
>> AND WHAT IS THAT CALLED WHEN 

706
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,582
THE COURT DECIDES THAT IT 

707
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,251
SHOULDN'T HAVE GRANTED A CASE? 

708
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:06,784
>> DISMISSING AS IMPROV 

709
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:07,953
DENTALLY GRANTED OR OTHER 

710
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,087
COLLOQUIAL KNOWN AS A DIG. 

711
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:09,621
>> AS A DIG. 

712
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:09,888
>> YEAH. 

713
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,923
SO YOU CAME UP WITH A STRATEGY 

714
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,626
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENCOURAGING 

715
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,062
THE COURT TO DIG A CASE THAT 

716
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,063
HAD PREVIOUSLY GRANT -- THAT IT 

717
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:18,697
HAD PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BECAUSE 

718
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,499
YOU BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT WAS 

719
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,601
GOING TO LOSE AND THE 

720
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,535
REGULATIONS AT ISSUE WERE GOING 

721
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,736
TO BE INVALIDATED AND YOU 

722
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:29,941
DIDN'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO 

723
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,809
HAVE TO ENDURE THAT. 

724
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,613
DID THEY ACCEPT YOUR ARGUMENTS? 

725
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,214
THE SUPREME COURT DID, YES. 

726
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,884
>> SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT, THE 

727
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,684
BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THE 

728
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,120
GENERAL'S OFFICE FOLLOWED YOUR 

729
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,756
ADVICE AND WROTE THE ARGUMENTS 

730
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,292
AS YOU HAD PRESCRIBED, THUS 

731
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:47,692
PROMPTING A DIG. 

732
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,495
AND AS A RESULT THE REGULATIONS 

733
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,529
STOOD, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 

734
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,164
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT, 

735
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:55,166
SENATOR. 

736
00:23:55,166 --> 00:24:00,205
>> THEY STOOD WHERE THEY 

737
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,173
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE FALLEN 

738
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:01,406
FALLEN. 

739
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:01,806
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

740
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,174
SO HERE AGAIN I HAVE A HARD 

741
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:05,477
TIME SEEING THIS AS ANYTHING 

742
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,945
OTHER THAN SOMETHING THAT HELPS 

743
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,448
YOU, THAT HELPS YOU NOT JUST 

744
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,248
WITH REPUBLICANS, BUT THAT 

745
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,049
HELPS YOU WITH DEMOCRATS. 

746
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,552
YOU SAW A PROBLEM WITH AN 

747
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,154
ARGUMENT THE GOVERNMENT WAS 

748
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,589
MAKING, YOU IDENTIFIED THAT 

749
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,391
PROBLEM, YOU OFFERED A REMEDY, 

750
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,625
THAT REMEDY WAS EMBRACED BY THE 

751
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,426
SLITTER GENERAL'S OFFICE AND 

752
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,128
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND 

753
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,329
THE COURT DID EXACTLY AS YOU 

754
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:28,600
WANTED IT DO AND AS A RESULT 

755
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,802
THE REGULATION STOOD, THE 

756
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,870
REGULATION THAT SENATOR BOOKER 

757
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,572
IS CONCERNED ABOUT WAS WANTING 

758
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,373
TO MAKE SURE WAS NOT UNDER 

759
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,308
ATTACK UNFAIRLY, WAS IN FACT 

760
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:36,608
PRESERVED. 

761
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,109
I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING WHY 

762
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,511
THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE HIM WANT TO 

763
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:41,913
VOTE MORE FOR YOU. 

764
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,181
IN FACT, I THINK SENATOR BOOKER 

765
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,618
REALLY SHOULD VOTE FOR YOU, 

766
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,520
I'LL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION 

767
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,654
WITH HIM LATER. 

768
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,755
>> HI, EVERYOE, I'M REASON 

769
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:50,988
REASON. 

770
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:51,957
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE 

771
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,559
CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR 

772
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,261
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 

773
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:56,561
KAVANAUGH. 

774
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,729
WELL, TODAY DEMOCRATS RELEASED 

775
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,597
PREVIOUSLY-CONFIDENTIAL 

776
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,332
DOCUMENTS RELATED TO 

777
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,433
KAVANAUGH'S VIEWS ON ABORTION 

778
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:01,933
AND RACIAL PROFILING. 

779
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,635
ONE OF THOSE WAS AN E-MAIL FROM 

780
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,570
2003 FROM KAVANAUGH, AND IT 

781
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,305
APPEARS TO SHOW HIM QUESTIONING 

782
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,173
WHETHER ROE V WADE ACTUALLY IS 

783
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,274
SETTLED LAW. 

784
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,942
AND THAT PUTS HIM AT ODDS WITH 

785
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:11,642
WHAT HE SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK. 

786
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,012
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT IN JUST 

787
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:14,278
A MOMENT. 

788
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,214
BUT, FIRST, WE BEGIN WITH THE 

789
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,449
PRESIDENT SEETHING OVER THE 

790
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,450
PUBLICATION OF A SCATHING 

791
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,217
ANONYMOUS OP-ED IN THE "NEW 

792
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:19,550
YORK TIMES." 

793
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,753
THE AUTHOR IS SAID TO BE A 

794
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,821
SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE 

795
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,189
ADMINISTRATION, AND TODAY THE 

796
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,526
HUNT IS ON TO FIND OUT WHO THAT 

797
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:27,826
PERSON IS. 

798
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,327
AND SINCE THE OP-ED'S RELEASE, 

799
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,329
SEVERAL TOP OFFICIALS OR THEIR 

800
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,732
OFFICES HAVE DENIED BEING ITS 

801
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,033
AUTHOR, INCLUDING THE VICE 

802

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, DAN 

804
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,737

AND THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE 

808
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:45,944
U.N. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE 

809
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,978
WAS TRENDING ONLINE YESTERDAY 

810
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,379
BECAUSE IT SAID THAT THE OP-ED 

811
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:51,116
INCLUDED A WORD THAT HE'S USED 

812
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:51,549
IN THE PAST. 

813
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,317
THAT WORD LONE STAR. 

814
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,785
WELL, TODAY THE VICE PRESIDENT

YORK TIMES." 

817
00:25:59,156 --> 00:25:59,991
>> I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE. 

818
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:00,525
THE ANONYMOUS EDITORIAL 

819
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,594
PUBLISHED IN THE "NEW YORK 

820
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,962
TIMES" REPRESENTS A NEW LOW IN 

821
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,696
AMERICAN JOURNALISM, AND I 

822
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,698
THINK THE "NEW YORK TIMES" 

823
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,201
SHOULD BE ASHAMED, AND I THINK 

824
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,503
WHOEVER WROTE THIS ANONYMOUS 

825
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,303
EDITORIAL SHOULD ALSO BE 

826
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:12,804
ASHAMED AS WELL. 

827
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,806
>> THE OP-ED QUESTIONS THE 

828
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,307
PRESIDENT'S FITNESS FOR OFFICE. 

829
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,743
THE AUTHOR WRITES THAT 

830
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,811
OFFICIALS ARE, QUOTE, THWARTING 

831
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,046
MR. TRUMP'S MORE MISGUIDED 

832
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,247
POLICIES UNTIL HE IS OUT OF 

833
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:23,481
OFFICE. 

834
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,015
IN RESPONSE THE PRESIDENT 

835
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:24,682
CALLED THE OFFICIAL GUTLESS AND 

836
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,986
CALLED FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" 

837
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,821
TO TURN THE PERSON OVER TO THE 

838
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,121
GOVERNMENT. 

839
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,589
LAWMAKERS HAVE REMAINED MOSTLY 

840
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,457
SILENT ON THIS EXPLOSIVE 

841
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,625
RELEASE, AND HERE'S WHAT HOUSE 

842
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,194
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN HAD TO SAY 

843
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,295
WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT TODAY. 

844
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,065
A PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE 

845
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,133
ADMINISTRATION SERVES AT THE 

846
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,035
PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT. 

847
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,304
IT'S A PERSON WHO OBVIOUSLY IS 

848
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:46,771
LIVING IN DISHONESTY. 

849
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,806
IT DOESN'T HELP THE PRESIDENT. 

850
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,974
SO IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN 

851
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:49,541
HELPING THE PRESIDENT, YOU 

852
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,610
SHOULDN'T WORK FOR THE 

853
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,212
PRESIDENT AS FAR AS I'M 

854
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:54,512
CONCERNED. 

855
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,181
>> WELL, JOINING ME NOW CBS 

856
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:56,781
NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT 

857

PAULA REID WHO JOIN US FROM THE

WHITE HOUSE. 

859
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,086
SO, PAULA, WHAT'S BEEN THE MOOD 

860
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,320
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE SINCE 

861
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,221
THIS OP-ED WAS RELEASED? 

862
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,656
>>REPORTER:  I WOULD DESCRIBE 

863
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,724
IT AS DEFIANT AND A BIT 

864
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,591
PARANOID. 

865
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,259
NOT ONLY IS THE PRESIDENT 

866
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,361
SEETHING OVER THIS OP-ED, HE'S 

867
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:13,264
ALSO VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS BOOK 

868
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:13,898
FORTHCOMING FROM BOB WOODWARD. 

869
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,066
THAT BOOK ALLEGES THAT DOZENS 

870
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,101
OF PEOPLE IN HIS OWN 

871
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,369
GOVERNMENT, EVEN IN HIS OWN 

872
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,770
WHITE HOUSE ARE ALLEGING THAT 

873
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,404
HE IS NOT FIT TO SERVE. 

874
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,239
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 

875
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,073
THAT IS NEW. 

876
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,808
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LEAK, 

877
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,442
ALMOST AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER 

878
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,511
OF LEAKS FROM THIS WHITE HOUSE, 

879
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,346
MANY OF WHICH ARE VERY CRITICAL 

880
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:28,779
OF THE PRESIDENT. 

881
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,448
BUT HERE IS SEEMS TO HAVE 

882
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:30,981
REACHED A FEVERED PITCH. 

883
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,317
BUT AS YOU SAW THERE, WHITE 

884
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,185
HOUSE OFFICIALS COMING OUT AND 

885
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,687
SLAMMING NOT ONLY THE ANONYMOUS 

886
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,789
OP-ED, BUT ALSO THE "NEW YORK 

887
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,489
TIMES" FOR PUBLISHING IT. 

888
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:41,292
>> YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT THE 

889
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,494
PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED ABOUT 

890
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,862
THIS, TREASON, CALLING IT DEEP 

891
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,630
STATE AND ALSO CLAIM THAT THE 

892
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,998
SWAMP HE'S TRYING TO DRAIN IS 

893
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,365
FIGHTING BACK. 

894
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,233
ARE THERE ANY CONCRETE ACTIONS 

895
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,834
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE COULD TAKE 

896
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,536
TO COMBAT THIS, AND DO YOU 

897
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,170
THINK THAT THEY COULD 

898
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,605
ULTIMATELY FORCE THE "NEW YORK 

899
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,273
TIMES" TO REVEAL THEIR SOURCE 

900
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:55,473
HERE? 

901
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,775
>>REPORTER:  I REALLY DON'T 

902
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,441
THINK THEY HAVE ANY GROUND 

903
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:58,777
LEGALLY SPEAKING TO FORCE THE 

904
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,112
"NEW YORK TIMES" TO REVEAL THE 

905
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:01,780
IDENTITY OF THIS PERSON. 

906
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,414
THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL LEGAL 

907
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,649
AVENUES WHEN IT COMES TO LEAKS, 

908
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,350
BUT HE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY 

909
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,285
GREAT OPTIONS THERE BECAUSE, 

910
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,488
FIRST OF ALL, HE WOULD NEED TO 

911
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,056
ARGUE THAT THIS FIT UNDER SOME 

912
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:12,756
SORT OF BROAD NATIONAL SECURITY 

913
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,025
PROTECTION, AND WHILE THE 

914
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,859
DEFINITION UNDER THE LAW FOR 

915
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,661
THAT IS PRETTY BROAD, I THINK 

916
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,430
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE 

917
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:18,830
THAT CASE HERE. 

918
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,232
NOW, THE OTHER OPTION IS TO ASK 

919
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,299
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO 

920
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:24,235
PURSUE A LEAK INVESTIGATION, 

921
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,637
BUT IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 

922
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,071
WAS TO PURSUE A LEAK 

923
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:28,606
INVESTIGATION, YOU WOULD 

924
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,408
ESSENTIALLY BE ADMITTING THAT 

925
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,408
WHATEVER WAS REVEALED IS TRUE. 

926
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,011
NOW, THE WHITE HOUSE CAN ALSO 

927
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,945
PURSUE ITS OWN LEAK 

928
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,246
INVESTIGATION, BUT, REALLY, 

929
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,380
THERE ARE NO GOOD LEGAL AVENUES 

930
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:36,580
HERE. 

931
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,817
IT WOULD BE BEST IT SEEMS FOR 

932
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,085
THE PRESIDENT TO REALLY FOCUS 

933
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,352
ON A POLITICAL RESPONSE WHICH 

934
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,221
IS WHAT HE IS DOING WHICH IS 

935
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,756
POINTING TO HIS SUPPORTERS AND 

936
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,357
SAYING, LOOK, THIS IS THE DEEP 

937
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,060
STATE, THIS IS THE SORT OF 

938
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,361
SWAMP THAT I AM TRYING TO 

939
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:50,594
DRAIN. 

940
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:52,330
AS I DRAIN IT, THEY ARE TRYING 

941
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,598
TO FIGHT BACK. 

942
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,600
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT HE'S 

943
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:55,900
DOING HERE. 

944
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,936
IN TERMS OF HIS LEGAL OPTIONS, 

945
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:02,073
THEY REALLY SEEM TO BE THE BEST 

946
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:02,974
BET IN TERMS OF LEGAL CONTROL. 

947
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,742
>> OMAROSA SAID LOOK AT PAGE 33 

948
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,276
OF MY BOOK. 

949
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,813
THAT MIGHT REVEAL OF WHO THAT 

950
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:09,179
SOURCE IT. 

951
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,281
INTERNALLY, DO THE WHITE HOUSE 

952
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,315
KNOW WHO THEY BELIEVE WHO IT 

953
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:11,482
IS. 

954
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:12,517
>>REPORTER:  THERE'S ONE SOURCE 

955
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,718
WHO SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THE 

956
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,219
PRESIDENT BELIEVES THIS IS 

957
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:18,256
LIKELY SOMEONE IN NATIONAL 

958
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,057
SECURITY OR IN THE JUSTICE 

959
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,291
DEPARTMENT, AND, REENA, YOU SAW 

960
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,027
THAT GRAPHIC THAT YOU PUT UP, 

961
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,763
THERE IS ONE AGENCY THAT IS 

962
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:26,363
CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT AND THAT 

963
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:27,866
IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHICH 

964
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,100
WHICH IS THE TARGET OF THE 

965
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,868
PRESIDENT'S IRE. 

966
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:30,868
I REACHED OUT TO THEM EARLIER 

967
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:31,102
TODAY. 

968
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,638
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT 

969
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,540
THEY WILL ISSUE ANY SORT OF 

970
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,575
RESPONSE AS ANY OTHER CABINET 

971
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,110
OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES HAVE 

972
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,310
DONE. 

973
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,645
BUT THAT IS ONE THEORY, WORKING 

974
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,479
THEORY WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE. 

975
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,847
>> SPEAKING OF D.O.J., I WANT 

976
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:46,150
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE 

977
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,383
D.O.J. 

978
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:47,719
I KNOW YOU'VE COVERED THIS 

979
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,253
EXTENSIVELY. 

980
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,120
THEY JUST ANNOUNCED CHARGES 

981
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,790
AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM, 

982
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,391
THIS IS IN CONNECTION TO 

983
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:53,891
MULTIPLE CYBER ATTACKS, 

984
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:54,559
PARTIALLY INCLUDING THE 2014 

985
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,193
SONY ATTACK. 

986
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,362
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 

987
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:57,695
THIS, PAULA? 

988
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:58,463
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S RIGHT. 

989
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,097
TODAY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 

990
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,098
UNSEALED CHARGES AGAINST A 

991
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,399
NORTH KOREAN HACKER, SOMEONE 

992
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,701
WHO IS WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE 

993
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,637
NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT, AND 

994
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,771
THEY CHARGED HIM IN NUMEROUS 

995
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:09,073
CYBER ATTACKS, MOST HIGH 

996
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,408
PROFILE WAS OF COURSE THE 2014 

997
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,943
ATTACK ON SONY PICTURES 

998
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:12,310
ENTERTAINMENT. 

999
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,613
BUT HE WAS ALSO CHARGED FOR 

1000
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,648
CREATING THE MALWARE USED IN A 

1001
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,318
2017 RANSOMWARE ATTACK AS WELL 

1002
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,218
AS A 2016 THEFT OF $81 MILLION 

1003
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:23,454
FROM A BANGLADESH -- EXCUSE ME, 

1004
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,388
FROM THE BANK OF BANGLADESH. 

1005
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:26,824
NOW, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME 

1006
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:30,261
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS 

1007
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,830
FILED CHARGES AGAINST SOMEONE 

1008
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,797
HACKING ON BEHALF OF AN 

1009
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,230
ADVERSARIAL NATION. 

1010
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,666
THEY'VE DONE THIS WITH RUSSIA, 

1011
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,101
WITH CHINA, WITH IRAN AND NOW 

1012
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:37,635
NORTH KOREA. 

1013
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,603
BUT, REENA, ONE OF THE 

1014
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,104
COMPLICATION OF TAKING THIS 

1015
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,240
APPROACH IS WE DON'T HAVE AN 

1016
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,874
EXTRADITION TREATY WITH ANY OF 

1017
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:44,008
 

1018
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,510
SO USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS 

1019
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,611
THESE CHARGES ARE ANNOUNCED 

1020
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,313
WITH GREAT FANFARE, BUT NO ONE 

1021
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,047
IS EVER ACTUALLY ARRESTED, NOR 

1022
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,015
DO THEY EVER SEE THE INSIDE OF 

1023
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,449
A U.S. COURTROOM. 

1024
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,684
SO SOME FOLKS HAVE QUESTION 

1025
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,053
WHETHER OR NOT THIS REALLY HAS 

1026
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,088
ANY SORT OF DETERRENT IMPACT. 

1027
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:59,924
>> I GET THE DETERRENT ASPECT. 

1028
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,159
I'M CURIOUS, PAULA, WHEN THE 

1029
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:01,392
D.O.J. 

1030
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,827
MAKES AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE 

1031
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,029
CHARGES LIKE THIS, IS IT IN 

1032
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,629
COORDINATION WITH THE WHITE 

1033
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:05,863
HOUSE? 

1034
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:06,430
IT'S SLIGHTLY STRANGE. 

1035
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,132
IT COMES ON THE SAME DAY THAT 

1036
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:08,900
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED HIS 

1037
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,400
THANKS TO JONG. 

1038
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,002
SO WHY DO YOU THANK SOMEBODY 

1039
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,370
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO 

1040
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,971
PRESS CHARGESES AGAINST THEM? 

1041
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:13,538
>>REPORTER:  THAT'S RIGHT. 

1042
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,939
IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT THE 

1043
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:15,573
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 

1044
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,009
WHITE HOUSE ARE COMPLETELY ON 

1045
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:18,643
THE SAME PAGE HERE. 

1046
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,444
USUALLY WHEN THERE'S ANY OTHER 

1047
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,512
SORT OF NATIONAL SECURITY CASE 

1048
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,014
FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, 

1049
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:23,715
THERE IS COORDINATION WITH THE 

1050
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,351
WHITE HOUSE, WITH THE NATIONAL 

1051
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,185
SECURITY COUNCIL, WITH THEIR 

1052
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:27,485
COMPONENTS. 

1053
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,586
HERE WE ARE ASK -- WE WERE 

1054
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,822
ASKED AT A BRIEFING EARLIER 

1055
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,357
TODAY IF THERE WAS ANY SORT OF 

1056
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,524
INER-AGENCY COORDINATION ON 

1057
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,826
THIS, AND THEY SAID, YES, THERE 

1058
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,327
WAS SOME, BUT THEY WOULD NOT 

1059
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,195
SPECIFY WHO THEY SPOKE WITH, 

1060
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,796
WHAT KIND OF COORDINATION THERE 

1061
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,865
IS WA AND WHETHER THE PRESIDENT 

1062
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:41,399
WAS NOTIFIED. 

1063
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,868
IT IS ALSO NOTABLE THAT THESE 

1064
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:44,368
CHARGES WERE ACTUALLY 

1065
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,737
ORIGINALLY FILED BACK IN MAY. 

1066
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,305
THEY WERE JUST MADE PUBLIC 

1067
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:47,538
TODAY. 

1068
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,506
AND OF COURSE WHEN THESE WERE 

1069
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,807
ORIGINALLY FILED, THIS WOULD 

1070
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,175
HAVE BEEN AROUND THE SAME TIME 

1071
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,409
AS THE NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT 

1072
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:53,577
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 

1073
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:53,844
JONG-UN. 

1074
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,046
SO THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS 

1075
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,482
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE WERE 

1076
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,683
WITHHELD SO AS NOT TO 

1077
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,917
COMPLICATE THAT SUMMIT ANY 

1078
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,652
FURTHER AND WHY THEY WERE 

1079
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,252
RELEASED TODAY. 

1080
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,453
BUT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS 

1081
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,155
NOT ABLE TO GIVE US AN ANSWER 

1082
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,890
ABOUT WHY THESE CHARGES WERE 

1083
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,590
MADE PUBLIC TODAY. 

1084
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,227
>> YOU KNOW, PAULA, I GOT A 

1085
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,895
FORTUNE COOKIE ON SATURDAY THAT 

1086
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,096
SAID MAY YOU LIVE IN 

1087
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:12,530
INTERESTING TIMES. 

1088
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,898
I GUESS THAT FORTUNE APPLIES TO 

1089
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:14,998
ALL OF US. 

1090
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:16,334
>>REPORTER:  I THINK IT 

1091
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:16,734
ABSOLUTELY DOES. 

1092
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,569
AND IT PROBABLY WILL FOR THE 

1093
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,002
FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 

1094
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:19,504
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

1095
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,139
ALL RIGHT, PAULA, THANK YOU SO 

1096
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:21,339
MUCH. 

1097
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:21,906
LOTS OF TWISTS AND TURNS. 

1098
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,442
PAULA REID COMING TO US FROM 

1099
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:24,975
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1100
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:26,277

IT WAS NEW JERSEY SENATE 

1108
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:37,655
DEMOCRAT CORY BOOKER. 

1109
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,824
HE RELEASED A BATCH OF 

1110
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:40,524
DOCUMENTS THAT WERE MARKED 

1111
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:41,259
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL, MEANING 

1112
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,126

1113
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,062

00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,396
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, NO ONE 

1115
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:45,596

AND AS BOOKER EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED 

1117
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,231
HIMSELF, HIS ACTIONS COULD 

1118
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:51,802
ACTUALLY GET HIM KICKED OUT OF 

1119
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:52,103
THE SENATE. 

1120
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,671

THAT THAT -- THE PENALTY COMES 

1126
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,481
WITH POTENTIAL OUSTING FROM THE 

1127
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:03,714
SENATE. 

1128
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:06,717
AND IF SENATOR CORNYN BELIEVES 

1129
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,318

1130
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:11,589

BEING WITHHELD FROM THE PUBLIC, 

1138
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,035
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 

1139
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,036
NATIONAL SECURITY, NOTHING TO 

1140
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,603
JEOPARDIZE THE SANG AT THIS 

1141
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:28,106
TIME OF THOSE IDEALS THAT I -- 

1142
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,375

1143
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,542
IDEALS THAT I HOLD DEAR. 

1144
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,809
INSTEAD, WHAT I'M RELEASING 

1145
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,013
THIS DOCUMENT RIGHT NOW TO 

1146
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:40,551
SHOW, SIR, IS THAT WE HAVE A 

1147
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,754
PROCESS HERE FOR A PERSON, THE 

1148
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:45,722
HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND FOR 

1149
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:46,691
A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. 

1150
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,226
WE'RE RUSHING THROUGH THIS 

1151
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,462
BEFORE ME AND MY COLLEAGUES CAN 

1152
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,630
EVEN READ AND DIGEST THE 

1153
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,963
INFORMATION. 

1154
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:54,799
>> RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS NO 

1155
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,902
EXCUSE FOR VIOLATING THE RULES 

1156
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,737
OF THE SENATE OR OF 

1157
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,539
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE 

1158
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,940
DOCUMENTS THAT WE ARE PRIVY TO. 

1159
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,010
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE 

1160
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,147
SENATOR DECIDING TO RELEASE 

1161
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:09,780
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION THAT IS 

1162
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,746
DEEMED CLASSIFIED BY THE 

1163
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:13,451
EXECUTIVE BRANCH BECAUSE YOU 

1164
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,087
HAPPEN TO DISAGREE WITH THE 

1165
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:16,620
CLASSIFICATION DECISION. 

1166
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,123
>> WELL, SHORTLY AFTER THAT, 

1167
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:19,889
HAWAII DEMOCRAT MAZIE HERONO 

1168
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,757
ALSO RELEASED COMMITTEE 

1169
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:21,559
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS TOO. 

1170
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,960
AND SHE SAYS THE DOCUMENTS SHOW 

1171
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,397
THAT KAVANAUGH BELIEVES THAT 

1172
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,397
PROGRAMS FOR NATIVE HAWAIIANS 

1173
00:34:27,397 --> 00:34:27,864
ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY 

1174
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:28,197
QUESTIONABLE. 

1175
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:29,833
FOR MORE ON THE HEARINGS, I 

1176
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,869
WANT TO BRING IN SCOTT LONG, 

1177
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:32,703
HE'S A SENIOR REPORTER FOR THE 

1178
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:32,902
HILL. 

1179
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:36,940
SO, SCOTT, WHAT EXACTLY WAS IN 

1180
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,476
THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT SENATOR 

1181
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:38,876
BOOKER RELEASED? 

1182
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:39,610
>> WELL, THERE WERE SEVERAL 

1183
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:39,909
DOCUMENTS. 

1184
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,547
I THINK THE ONE THAT HE WAS 

1185
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,047
REFERRING TO IN YOUR CLIP HAD 

1186
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:48,985
TO DO WITH DISCUSSIONS IN THE 

1187
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,621
WHITE HOUSE THAT WERE TAKING 

1188
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,692
PLACE RIGHT AFTER 9/11 IN 2002. 

1189
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,495
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT 

1190
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,065
HOW CERTAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1191
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:05,403
PROGRAMS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED, 

1192
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:05,870
HOW T.S.A. 

1193
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,637
SHOULD HANDLE SECURITY MEASURES 

1194
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,239
FOR AIRPORTS, THE T.S.A. 

1195
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,807
AGENCY THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED 

1196
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:10,240
AT THAT TIME. 

1197
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,177
AND SO THESE WERE ARGUMENTS, 

1198
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,646
DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE TAKING 

1199
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,448
PLACE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1200
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,318
CORY BOOKER BELIEVES THAT, YOU 

1201
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:25,690
KNOW, IT REVEALED OR SHOWED 

1202
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,925
SOME OF KAVANAUGH'S 

1203
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:28,993
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MUSLIMS 

1204
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:29,760
PERHAPS, BUT, YOU KNOW, 

1205
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,296
KAVANAUGH IS DENYING THAT, AND, 

1206
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,867
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY INTERESTING 

1207
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:36,067
NOW. 

1208
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,436
WE ARE SEEING SENATORS SORT OF 

1209
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,504
RACING TO RELEASE DOCUMENTS IN 

1210
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:41,204
THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. 

1211
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:43,307
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, SCOTT, THE 

1212
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,475
PUNISHMENT HERE FOR RELEASING 

1213
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,108
THESE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL 

1214
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:46,310
DOCUMENTS COULD BE AS SERIOUS 

1215
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,444
AS BEING KICKED OUT OF THE 

1216
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:47,678
SENATE. 

1217
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,714
HOW LIKELY DO YOU THINK THAT'S 

1218
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:53,084
GOING TO HAPPEN, ESPECIALLY 

1219
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,518
WITH BOOKER AND HERONO 

1220
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:55,186
RELEASING THESE DOCUMENTS? 

1221
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,754
>> I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY 

1222
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:58,355
THAT REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES 

1223
00:35:58,355 --> 00:36:02,760
WOULD MOVE TO EXPEL A MEMBER OF 

1224
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,894
THE SENATE IN THIS CASE. 

1225
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:06,130
IT IS SORT OF UNPRECEDENTED 

1226
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,398
THAT WE WOULD SEE DEMOCRATS, 

1227
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,466
YOU KNOW, COMPETING WITH ONE 

1228
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:11,302
ANOTHER TO RELEASE THESE 

1229
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:15,239
DOCUMENTS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

1230
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,373
HAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL. 

1231
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:18,042
HOWEVER, INFORM THE COMMENTS OF 

1232
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,644
DICK DURBIN, ONE OF THE 

1233
00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:21,512
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WHO ALSO 

1234
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,614
SERVES ON THE JUDICIARY, HE 

1235
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,684
SAID THAT HE STANDS WITH CORY 

1236
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,919
BOOKER, HE ASSOCIATES HIMSELF 

1237
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,621
WITH CORY BOOKER'S ACTIONS, AND 

1238
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,323
THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE TO 

1239
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,058
RETALIATE AGAINST CORY BOOKER, 

1240
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,794
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE 

1241
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,528
AGAINST ALMOST ALL DEMOCRATS 

1242
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,462
AND REPUBLICANS I THINK ARE 

1243
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,229
UNWILLING TO DO SO. 

1244
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:42,333
>> I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

1245
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:42,733
ANOTHER EXCHANGE. 

1246
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,037
THIS ONE WAS FROM LAST NIGHT 

1247
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,238
AND IT WAS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA 

1248
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,673
DEMOCRAT KAMALA HARRIS AND 

1249
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,640
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

1250
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,710
>> HAVE YOU DISCUSSED MUELLER 

1251
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,311
OR HIS INVESTIGATION WITH 

1252
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:58,683
ANYONE AT CASSOWITS, BENSON AND 

1253
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,350
TORRES, THE LAW FIRM FOUNDED BY 

1254
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,322
MARK CASSOWITS, PRESIDENT 

1255
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,056
TRUMP'S PERSONAL LAWYER? 

1256
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,657
BE SURE ABOUT YOUR ANSWER, SIR. 

1257
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,258
>> WELL, I'M NOT REMEMBERING. 

1258
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:09,327
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU 

1259
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:09,694
WANT TO -- 

1260
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,629
>> ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU HAVE NOT 

1261
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,332
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ANYONE 

1262
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,199
AT THAT LAW FIRM? 

1263
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,066
WHO DID YOU TALK TO? 

1264
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:18,703
>> I DON'T THINK -- I'M NOT 

1265
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,036
REMEMBERING. 

1266
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,171
BUT I'M HAPPY TO BE REFRESHED 

1267
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,074
OR IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHO 

1268
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:23,507
YOU'RE THINKING -- 

1269
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,210
>> SIR, ARE YOU SAYING THAT 

1270
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,412
WITH ALL YOU REMEMBER YOU HAVE 

1271
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,815
-- YOU HAVE AN IMPECCABLE 

1272
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,049
MEMORY, YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING 

1273
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,651
EIGHT HOURS OR MORE WITH THIS 

1274
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,451
COMMITTEE ABOUT ALL SORTS OF 

1275
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:34,918
THINGS YOU REMEMBER. 

1276
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:36,721
HOW CAN YOU NOT REMEMBER 

1277
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,857
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD A 

1278
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,726
CONVERSATION ABOUT ROBERT 

1279
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,160
MUELLER OR HIS INVESTIGATION 

1280
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,128
WITH ANYONE AT THAT LAW FIRM. 

1281
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,529
THIS INVESTIGATION HAS ONLY 

1282
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,231
BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG, SIR. 

1283
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,265
SO PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

1284
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,366
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK DO 

1285
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:51,302
I KNOW ANYONE WHO WORKS AT THAT 

1286
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:51,502
FIRM. 

1287
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,537
I MIGHT KNOW -- I WOULD LIKE TO 

1288
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,939
KNOW THE PERSON YOU'RE THINKING 

1289
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,874
OF BECAUSE WHAT IF THERE'S -- 

1290
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,476
>> I THINK YOU'RE THINKING OF 

1291
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,277
SOMEONE YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL 

1292
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:00,443
US. 

1293
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:02,012
>> WELL, THAT EXCHANGE WAS 

1294
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:03,614
ACTUALLY INTRUMENTED LATER BY 

1295
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,081
REPUBLICAN MIKE LEE. 

1296
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,616
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS SAYS -- 

1297
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,019
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS 

1298
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,020
HER PUSHING FOR THIS. 

1299
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,788
THIS IS ACTUALLY TRUMP'S 

1300
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:13,290
LAWYER'S LAW FIRM. 

1301
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,859
WHY DO YOU THINK HE SO 

1302
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:15,860
PAINSTAKINGLY AVOIDED THAT 

1303
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,260
QUESTION? 

1304
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,128
>> WELL, I THINK THESE ARE 

1305
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,929
QUESTIONS THAT COULD COME 

1306
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,097
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IN 

1307
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,700
FUTURE MONTHS, ESPECIALLY ONCE 

1308
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,771
WE KNOW THE RESULTS OF THE 

1309
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,872
ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION 

1310
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,206
SPECIFICALLY, WHETHER TRUMP CAN 

1311
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,641
INTERVENE AND STOP THE MUELLER 

1312
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,410
INVESTIGATION, WHETHER HE CAN 

1313
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,511
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER HIMSELF OR 

1314
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:35,980
MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM, AND SO IF 

1315
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,481
KAVANAUGH IS SERVING ON A 

1316
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,586
SUPREME COURT THAT IS DECIDING 

1317
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,321
THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES, I THINK 

1318
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:45,556
IT'S IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW, 

1319
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,592
WHETHER WE KNOW WHETHER HE HAS 

1320
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,526
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF 

1321
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:50,861
TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS WHO ARE 

1322
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,963
SPECIFICALLY BROUGHT ON TO DEAL 

1323
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,064
WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. 

1324
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,032
>> AND, YOU KNOW, KAVANAUGH AT 

1325
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,968
THIS POINT, SCOTT, IS THERE 

1326
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,137
ANYTHING THAT WOULD INDICATE TO 

1327
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,072
YOU THAT HIS NOMINATION, 

1328
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:05,042
CHANCESES OF BEING CONFIRMED 

1329
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:05,943
ARE ACTUALLY -- CHANCES OF 

1330
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,112
BEING CONFIRMED ARE ACTUALLY AT 

1331
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:08,412
THIS POINT? 

1332
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,213
>> I DON'T THINK SO. 

1333
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,549
WE SAW THE SWEARING IN OF 

1334
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:12,917
FORMER ARIZONA SENATOR JON KYL 

1335
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,218
YESTERDAY WHO REPLACED McCAIN 

1336
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:14,851
IN THE SENATE. 

1337
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,687
THEY ARE BACK AT 51 SEATS. 

1338
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:22,126
IT IS A NARROW MAJORITY, BUT IT 

1339
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:22,526
IS A MAJORITY. 

1340
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,129
AND WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY 

1341
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,431
VOTE, THEY CAN CONFIRM 

1342
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,500
KAVANAUGH, ESPECIALLY WITH 

1343
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,669
PERHAPS SOME HELP FROM THE VICE 

1344
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:31,969
PRESIDENT. 

1345
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,971
AND WE ARE EXPECTING SOME 

1346
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,107
DEMOCRATS TO PERHAPS COME 

1347
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,675
ACROSS THE AISLE AND PROVIDE 

1348
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,075
ADDITIONAL VOTES. 

1349
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,746
SO RIGHT NOW AS I SEE IT THERE 

1350
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,881
HAS NOT BEEN ANY SORT OF 

1351
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,315
KNOCKOUT BLOW. 

1352
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,783
CERTAINLY THESE NEW E-MAIL 

1353
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:48,652
RELEASES HAVE RAISED SOME 

1354
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:48,952
QUESTIONS. 

1355
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:51,121
BUT SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS 

1356
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:51,955
ON HIS WAY TO CONFIRMATION. 

1357
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:53,224
>> ALL RIGHT, SCOTT, BEFORE WE 

1358
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,658
GO, I WANT TO ASK YOU ALSO 

1359
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,227
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT KIND OF 

1360
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:56,861
CAUGHT OUR EYE THAT CAME DOWN 

1361
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,161
TODAY. 

1362
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,162
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS 

1363
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,599
TO CHANGE A RULE THAT WOULD 

1364
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,267
ACTUALLY ALLOW UNDOCUMENTED 

1365
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:03,867
CHILDREN TO BE DETAINED 

1366
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:04,201
INDEFINITELY. 

1367
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,503
THIS ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE PENDING 

1368
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,169
AN IMMIGRATION COURT CASE. 

1369
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:07,504
PREVIOUSLY THEY HAD TO RELEASE 

1370
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:08,539
THESE KIDS WITHIN 20 DAYS. 

1371
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,939
WHAT IS THIS -- DO YOU BELIEVE 

1372
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,275
THIS HAS TRACTION, AND WHAT 

1373
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:15,312
DOES IT MEAN FOR THE FAMILIES 

1374
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,247
WHO HAVE CHILDREN IN U.S. 

1375
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:16,547
DETENTIONS? 

1376
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,515
>> WELL, IF THIS RULE IS 

1377
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,316
IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF THE 

1378
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,952
YEAR, IT WILL MEAN THAT PEOPLE 

1379
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:25,856
THAT COME ACROSS THE BORDER AND 

1380
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,259
BRING THEIR CHILDREN WITH NOW 

1381
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,160
BE DETAINED INDEFINITELY 

1382
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,229
TOGETHER RATHER THAN SEPARATING 

1383
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,865
KIDS AND PARENTS, BUT THAT 

1384
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,066
INDEFINITE DETENTION IS SORT OF 

1385
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:36,333
THE KEY. 

1386
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,369
IT WOULD LAST UNTIL A COURT 

1387
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,938
CASE IS RESOLVED, UNTIL THEY 

1388
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:45,009
ARE EITHER DEPORTED OR GRANTED 

1389
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,710
ACCESS TO THE UNITED STATES. 

1390
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,811
IT THROWS THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE 

1391
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,480
RIGHT FRONT AND CENTER RIGHT 

1392
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,714
BEFORE THE NOVEMBER MIDTERM 

1393
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:51,014
ELECTIONS. 

1394
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:53,217
I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHY THE 

1395
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,220
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND WHY 

1396
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,223
THE PRESIDENT PUSHED SO 

1397
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,090
AGGRESSIVELY TO GET THIS RULE 

1398
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:00,390
COMPLETED. 

1399
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,125
AND SO ONCE AGAIN, AN ISSUE 

1400
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:05,129
THAT WE THOUGHT WAS SORT OF ON 

1401
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,897
THE BACK BURNER, IMMIGRATION 

1402
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,232
AND CHILD DETENTIONS IS FRONT 

1403
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,833
AND CENTER ONCE AGAIN. 

1404
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:10,634
>> AND, SCOTT, YOU KNOW, 

1405
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,335
THERE'S ROUGHLY -- LAST 

1406
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,971
ESTIMATE WE HAD WHICH WAS FROM 

1407
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,406
A FEW WEEKS AGO FROM D.H.S. 

1408
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,707
THAT THERE ARE ROUGHLY 500 KIDS 

1409
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,277
WHO STILL REMAIN SEPARATED FROM 

1410
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:20,644
THEIR PARENTS. 

1411
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,812
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE KIDS? 

1412
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,112
DO WE KNOW? 

1413
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,681
>> WELL, I THINK D.H.S. 

1414
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:28,319
IS IN A LOT OF THOSE CASES HAS 

1415
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,987
STRUGGLED TO REUNITE THOSE 

1416
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,088
CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS, 

1417
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,390
EITHER BECAUSE THEY CAN'T 

1418
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,292
LOCATE THEM OR BECAUSE THOSE 

1419
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,696
PARENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN 

1420
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,264
DEPORTED BACK TO THEIR OWN 

1421
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:42,032
COUNTRIES. 

1422
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,567
IT'S REALLY AN INDIVIDUAL 

1423
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:43,800
BASIS. 

1424
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,768
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IN THESE VERY 

1425
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:45,569
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT'S 

1426
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,371
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THESE 500 

1427
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:47,571
KIDS. 

1428
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:47,905
>> ALL RIGHT. 

1429
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,541
SCOTT WONG, GRATEFUL YOU COULD 

1430
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,942
JOIN US FROM THE HILL. 

1431
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:52,810
SCOTT, THANK YOU. 

1432
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,610
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

1433
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,879
>>>  WELL ARE, NOW I WANT TO 

1434
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:58,148
GET TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS 

1435
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:58,648
FROM NORTH KOREA. 

1436
00:41:58,648 --> 00:41:59,849
KIM JONG-UN SAYS HE IS 

1437
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:01,652
COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION 

1438
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,420
BY THE END OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

1439
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,755
FIRST TERM. 

1440
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:05,689
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH 

1441
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,122
KOREAN GOVERNMENT. 

1442
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:07,191
A DELEGATION FROM SEOUL MET 

1443
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,059
WITH KIM ON WEDNESDAY AND 

1444
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,160
DELIVERED A PRIVATE MESSAGE. 

1445
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,795
THE MESSAGE WAS FROM PRESIDENT 

1446
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:12,028
TRUMP. 

1447
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:14,632
AND NOW SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIALS 

1448
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:15,532
SAY THAT THE NORTH KOREAN 

1449
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,735
LEADER ALSO PRAISED MR. TRUMP 

1450
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:18,602
AND EXPRESSED FULL CONFIDENCE 

1451
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:18,835
IN HIM. 

1452
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,938
WELL, THE PRESIDENT SHARED HIS 

1453
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:21,705

PROCLAIMS UNWAVERING FAITH IN 

1457
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:27,177
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1458
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,178
THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN KIM. 

1459
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,514
WE WILL GET IT DONE TOGETHER. 

1460
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,149
FOR MORE ON THIS WE'RE JOINED 

1461
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,017
BY ISAAC STONE FISH, A CBSN 

1462
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:36,987
CONTRIBUTOR AND A SENIOR FELLOW 

1463
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,156
AT THE ASIAN SOCIETY CENTER ON 

1464
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:39,623
U.S./CHINA RELATIONS. 

1465
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,223
THE THING ABOUT THIS STORY, 

1466
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:41,425
ISAAC, IT'S ALWAYS STOOD OUT TO 

1467
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:44,328
ME, SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE 

1468
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,428
WORKED ON THIS, PREVIOUS 

1469
00:42:45,428 --> 00:42:45,996
ADMINISTRATIONS, THE KOREA 

1470
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,998
TALKS WERE SO OPTIMISTIC AND 

1471
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,033
ACTUALLY GAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1472
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,136
THE UPPER HAND WHICH PEOPLE 

1473
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,203
TYPICALLY HAVEN'T ON FOREIGN 

1474
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:53,536
POLICY HERE. 

1475
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:54,471
THESE CLAIMS OF 

1476
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,173
DENUCLEARIZATION THAT KIM HAS 

1477
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,641
MADE, DO YOU BUY THEM? 

1478
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,543
DOES THE ADMINISTRATION STILL 

1479
00:42:59,543 --> 00:42:59,810
BUY THEM? 

1480
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,645
>> I PERSONALLY DON'T BUY THEM. 

1481
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,414
I THINK POSSIBLY KIM JONG-UN IS 

1482
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,350
SAYING, OKAY, WE WILL GET RID 

1483
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,919
OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHEN THE 

1484
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,687
UNITED STATES RELEASES ITS 

1485
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:10,487
NUCLEAR UMBRELLA OVER SOUTH 

1486
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,256
KOREA WHEN IT MOVES A LOT OF 

1487
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,958
THE TROOPS OR ALL OF THE 

1488
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:15,725
TROOPS, ALL OF THE ROUGHLY 

1489
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:18,262
28,500 TROOPS THAT AMERICA HAS 

1490
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,963
ON THE SOUTH KOREAN PENINSULA 

1491
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:23,500
AND IF IT SIGNS A PEACE TREATY 

1492
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,169
THAT WOULD OFFICIALLY END THE 

1493
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:25,669
1950, 1953 KOREAN WAR. 

1494
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,238
I THINK IT'S A SURPRISING MOVE 

1495
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,373
BY KIM JONG-UN, AND IT'S 

1496
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,909
CERTAINLY THROWING TRUMP A LIFE 

1497
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,676
LINE WHEN HE CERTAINLY NEEDS 

1498
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:32,876
ONE. 

1499
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,578
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S 

1500
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,246
ACTUALLY GOING TO LEAD TO NORTH 

1501
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:36,779
KOREAN DENUCLEARIZATION. 

1502
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:37,714
>> YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

1503
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:39,717
ALWAYS SO QUICK TO PRAISE THE 

1504
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:40,717
NORTH KOREAN LEADER. 

1505
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:42,119
HOW DOES THAT IMPACT 

1506
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:42,986
NEGOTIATIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH 

1507
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:43,286
DIPLOMATS? 

1508
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:47,124
>> IT'S BEEN SUCH A SHOCKING 

1509
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:47,558
DAY, SHOCKING WEEK. 

1510
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,793
I MEAN, DEEP STATE, FAKE NEWS, 

1511
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,329
TRUMP HAS THIS FEELING OF BEING 

1512
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:53,897
VERY, VERY BELEAGUERED AND 

1513
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:56,266
PARANOID, AND WHO DOES HE TURN 

1514
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,000
TO TO PRAISE? 

1515
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,333
KIM JONG-UN. 

1516
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:57,600
>> YEAH. 

1517
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,337
>> I THINK KIM PLAYED A VERY 

1518
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,407
SUCCESSFUL DIPLOMATIC MANEUVER 

1519
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,875
BY PRAISING TRUMP AND SAYING 

1520
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:05,642
HOW TRUSTWORTHY HE THOUGHT 

1521
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,744
TRUMP WAS AT THIS TIME WHEN 

1522
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:08,912
TRUMP HIMSELF IS PROBABLY 

1523
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,248
FEELING INCREDIBLY PARANOID AND 

1524
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,749
DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE CAN TRUST. 

1525
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,818
AND NOW WE'RE AT THIS VERY 

1526
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,452
BIZARRE SPECTACLE WHERE IT 

1527
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,454
SEEMS LIKE KIM JONG-UN IS 

1528
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,021
SOMEONE TRUMP THINKS HE CAN 

1529
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:18,255
TRUST. 

1530
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,823
>> SO THE DELEGATION FROM SOUTH 

1531
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,692
KOREA MET WITH KIM YESTERDAY, A 

1532
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,592
SPECIAL LETTER WAS DELIVERED 

1533
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:23,193
FROM THE PRESIDENT. 

1534
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,963
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE 

1535
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:26,230
CONTENT? 

1536
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,031
>> WE DON'T. 

1537
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,598
WE KNOW THAT THE TWO SIDES ARE 

1538
00:44:28,598 --> 00:44:30,033
-- EXCHANGED LETTER, AND WE DO 

1539
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:33,137
KNOW THAT THIS WAS A VISIT TO 

1540
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,638
SET UP THE SOUTH KOREAN 

1541
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,206
PRESIDENT'S FIRST TRIP TO 

1542
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:36,907
PYONGYANG, SEPTEMBER 18th, 

1543
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:37,274
SEPTEMBER 20th. 

1544
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,709
WE DON'T KNOW YET IF THIS HAS 

1545
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,144
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE 

1546
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,377
POSSIBILITY OF KIM JONG-UN 

1547
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:42,279
COMING TO NEW YORK FOR THE 

1548
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,447
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

1549
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:44,714
AT THE END OF THE MONTH. 

1550
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:46,383
THERE'S A LOT OF RUMORS ABOUT 

1551
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:46,583
THAT. 

1552
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,052
EARLIER IN THE SUMMER, 

1553
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:51,088
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SUMMIT, 

1554
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,790
THOSE HAVE DIED DOWN SINCE ALL 

1555
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,024
OF THE TENSIONS THAT HAVE SORT 

1556
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,259
OF FLARED UP AGAIN AFTER THE 

1557
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,194
SUMMIT, BUT WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT 

1558
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,595
EXACTLY THE TWO SIDES WERE 

1559
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:58,828
SAYING. 

1560
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:00,130
>> DO YOU SEE REALISTICALLY 

1561
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,098
BECAUSE EVEN BEFORE PRESIDENT 

1562
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,566
MOON CAME INTO OFFICE, HE HAD 

1563
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,534
SAID HE REALLY WANTS TO IRON 

1564
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,868
OUT SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH 

1565
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,470
NORTH KOREA, MAKE THIS WORK. 

1566
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,771
COULD YOU SEE A SITUATION WHERE 

1567
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,139
THE TWO KOREAS WORK THIS OUT 

1568
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,140
TOGETHER WITHOUT THE U.S., OR 

1569
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,174
DOES THE U.S. NEED TO BE THERE? 

1570
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:12,342
>> I THINK THE U.S. REALLY 

1571
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,043
NEEDS TO BE THERE. 

1572
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,746
AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS 

1573
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,381
THAT NORTH KOREA IS HAVING THIS 

1574
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,384
WITH SOUTH KOREA IS BECAUSE IT 

1575
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,186
IS AFRAID OF CHINA, IT'S AFRAID 

1576
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,153
OF OVERWHELMING CHINESE 

1577
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:23,453
INFLUENCE. 

1578
00:45:23,453 --> 00:45:24,855
ROUGHLY 90% OF NORTH KOREA'S 

1579
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,791
TRADE GOES THROUGH CHINA, AND I 

1580
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,093
THINK NORTH KOREA REALLY 

1581
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,128
REALIZES THE DANGERS OF BEING 

1582
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,863
OVERLY RELIANT ON THAT ONE 

1583
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:33,263
NATION. 

1584
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,498
SO THEY'RE LOOKING TO SOUTH 

1585
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:34,731
KOREA. 

1586
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:35,265
THEY'RE IN A SMALLER WAY 

1587
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,633
LOOKING TO JAPAN AND RUSSIA, 

1588
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,703
AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE 

1589
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,370
UNITED STATES, BECAUSE IF NORTH 

1590
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:40,971
KOREA JUST HAS IMPROVED 

1591
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,539
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOUTH KOREA, 

1592
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,175
IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ENOUGH TO 

1593
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,043
PROTECT IT FROM OVERWHELMING 

1594
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:46,476
CHINESE INFLUENCE. 

1595
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:47,311
>> AND IF TALKS WITH NORTH 

1596
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,812
KOREA COMPLETELY DERAIL, DO YOU 

1597
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,547
GET A SENSE FROM THE 

1598
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,180
ADMINISTRATION THERE'S A PLAN 

1599
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:51,347
B? 

1600
00:45:51,347 --> 00:45:53,951
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A 

1601
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:54,885
PLAN A. 

1602
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:55,485
>> WELL SAID. 

1603
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:57,054
SOME PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH 

1604
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:57,421
THAT STATEMENT. 

1605
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,289
SO, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT 

1606
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,657
THEY ARE PUSHING RIGHT NOW, 

1607
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:01,792
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY 

1608
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,261
PUSHING TO SORT OF GET SOME 

1609
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,562
SORT OF TALKS WITH THEM, POMPEO 

1610
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,931
HAS HAD EARNEST ATTEMPTS TO TRY 

1611
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,732
TO MAKE THIS WORK. 

1612
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:09,499
HE'S THE AMERICAN OFFICIAL 

1613
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:11,835
THAT'S SPENT THE MOST TIME WITH 

1614
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:12,502
KIM JONG-UN AT THIS POINT. 

1615
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:14,805
IF THESE TALKS DO FAIL, IS 

1616
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:15,572
ANYBODY AT THE STATE 

1617
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,940
DEPARTMENT, ANY FOLKS YOU'RE 

1618
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,975
TALKING TO HAVE ANY SENSE THAT 

1619
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,276
THERE IS ANOTHER PATH FORWARD 

1620
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,477
IN DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA? 

1621
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,180
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE 

1622
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,314
SPOKEN TO AND THE GENERAL 

1623
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:25,716
CONSENSUS IN D.C. IS LET'S HOPE 

1624
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,252
IT DOESN'T REVERT TO WHERE IT 

1625
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,654
WAS A YEAR AGO WHEN KIM JONG-UN 

1626
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,623
WAS CALLING TRUMP A DOTARRED 

1627
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,957
AND TRUMP WAS PROMISING FIRE 

1628
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,892
AND FURY, LIKE THE WORLD HAS 

1629
00:46:35,892 --> 00:46:36,192
NEVER SEEN. 

1630
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:37,794
SO NOT TO BE TOO HARSH ON THE 

1631
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:38,729
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I DO 

1632
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,098
THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF 

1633
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,432
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE 

1634
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,033
PRESIDENT WHO REALIZED THAT 

1635
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,701
GOING TO WAR WITH NORTH KOREA 

1636
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,836
WOULD BE A DISASTROUS THING, 

1637
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,738
AND I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE 

1638
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,305
WHO ARE WORKING TO PREVENT 

1639
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:48,505

THIS ONE IS DESCRIBED AS 

1652
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,925
EXTREME AND IT'S FORCED A MAJOR

1654
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:08,792

1674
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:56,793

CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK AFTER HE 

1694

JOINED THE TALIBAN. 

1695
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,358
THIS COMES ONE DAY AFTER A

ISIS HAS CLAIMED 

1705
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:40,036
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:43,773
HAPPEN TODAY IN DELAWARE. 

1816
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:44,741
>> NANCY, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING 

1817
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,608
POLITICS FOR SOME TIME. 

1818
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,175
ARE YOU SURPRISED ABOUT HOW 

1819
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,343
WE'RE SEEING -- I DON'T KNOW 

1820
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,211
WHAT THE POLITICAL TERM WOULD 

1821
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,847
BE IF IT IS ACTUALLY A WAVE OR 

1822
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,982
NOT, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY 

1823
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,751
SURPRISES THAT HAVE COME IN 

1824
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,186
PRIMARIES THROUGH THE COURSE OF 

1825
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:56,519
THIS SEASON. 

1826
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,522
ARE YOU SURPRISED AS SOMEONE 

1827
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,290
WHO'S WATCHED THIS? 

1828
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,859
>> I AM SURPRISED. 

1829
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,060
IN SOME WAYS I FEEL THERE'S 

1830
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,395
ALWAYS A PENDULUMSWINGING AND 

1831
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,331
I THINK IN 2016 IT SWING, AND 

1832
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,466
IT HAS JUST TAKEN THAT MOMENTUM 

1833
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:10,599
AND SWUNG OVER, AND I FEEL THAT 

1834
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:12,669
WE'RE ALL KIND OF ON A RIDE 

1835
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,504
RIGHT NOW, JUST WAITING TO SEE 

1836
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,205
WHERE OUR POLITICAL CULTURE AND 

1837
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,272
OUR SOCIETY IS GOING TO SHAKE 

1838
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:16,472
OUT. 

1839
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:17,574
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO 

1840
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,142
GET BACK TO THE MIDDLE, I DON'T 

1841
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,145
THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET 

1842
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,214
FURTHER RIGHT OR FURTHER LEFT. 

1843
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,351
I HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE IT IS SO 

1844
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,086
UNPREDICTABLE, ESPECIALLY WITH 

1845
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,221
AN ELECTORATE THAT'S JUST SO 

1846
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,021
ANGRY AND FRUSTRATING BY WHAT 

1847
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,456
THEY SEE IS NOT HAPPENING 

1848
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,058
EITHER FOR THEM OR FOR THEIR 

1849
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:35,291
STATE. 

1850
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:35,959
>> AND, YOU KNOW, JUST LAST 

1851
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:40,330
NIGHT FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE 

1852
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,399
BIDEN ISSUED A ROBO CALL 

1853
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:42,932
ENDORSING SENATOR CARPER. 

1854
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:43,766
IS THAT UNUSUAL? 

1855
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:45,434
>> IT IS UNUSUAL FOR SENATOR 

1856
00:56:45,434 --> 00:56:46,368
BIDEN TO BE INVOLVED IN 

1857
00:56:46,368 --> 00:56:49,973
ELECTIONS EVER SINCE HE WENT TO 

1858
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:50,373
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1859
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,208
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR 

1860
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,877
THE VICE PRESIDENT TO BE 

1861
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:54,677
INVOLVED WITH TOM CARPER. 

1862
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,414
THEY WORKED VERY CLOSELY ON THE 

1863
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,183
HILL FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHEN 

1864
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,718
THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS A 

1865
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,887
SENATOR AND THE SENATOR WAS A 

1866
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:04,621
CONGRESSMAN, THAT'S THE 

1867
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,222
DELAWARE WAY, AND THEY HAVE 

1868
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,624
WORKED TOGETHER ON MANY ISSUES 

1869
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:11,127
FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR THE 

1870
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:11,360
STATE. 

1871
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,229
SO I WASN'T SURPRISED BY IT. 

1872
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,465
PERHAPS MORE OF, YOU KNOW, 

1873
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,099
ACTUAL PHYSICAL APPEARANCES ON 

1874
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,500
BEHALF OF THE DEMOCRAT 

1875
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,802
INCUMBENT WOULD HAVE BEEN 

1876
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:19,736
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE 

1877
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:20,203
TOTALLY SHOCKED ME. 

1878
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:21,971
>> SO CARPER IS ACTUALLY THE 

1879
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:22,806
ONLY REMAINING DEMOCRAT IN THE 

1880
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,508
SENATE WHO VOTED TO CONFIRM 

1881
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,510
BRETT KAVANAUGH WHEN HE WAS UP 

1882
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,346
FOR CONFIRMATION BACK IN 2006 

1883
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:31,213
FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT. 

1884
00:57:31,213 --> 00:57:34,651
IS THAT SORT OF DECISION, THAT 

1885
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,786
VOTE PLAYING OUT IN THIS RACE 

1886
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,053
AT ALL? 

1887
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:37,887
>> VERY LITTLE. 

1888
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:42,258
I THINK THAT IT WAS IN THE 

1889
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,393
BEGINNING, BUT THE SENATOR SHOT 

1890
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,562
IT DOWN, AND KERRY HARRIS HAS 

1891
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,497
MOVED ON TO OTHER WAYS TO, YOU 

1892
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:48,598
KNOW, PINPOINT THINGS WITHIN 

1893
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,099
THE RECORD THAT SHE COULD DRAW 

1894
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,101
ATTENTION TO, MOSTLY THE FACT 

1895
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,436
THAT SHE'S GOING FOR THE FACT 

1896
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:54,270
THAT SHE'S A NEWCOMER, AN 

1897
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,506
OUTSIDER AND HE IS A PART OF 

1898
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:57,707
THE OLD GUARD. 

1899
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,842
IT'S SORT OF THE OLD AGE ISSUE 

1900
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:00,743
BUT WITH NEW DEFINITIONS. 

1901
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,779
>> INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SAY 

1902
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:02,979
THAT. 

1903
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,913
YOU KNOW, NANCY, WALK US 

1904
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:04,614
THROUGH THIS, THE REPUBLICAN 

1905
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:07,250
SIDE OF THIS RACE, WHAT CAN WE 

1906
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,617
EXPECT AND WHO ARE YOU 

1907
00:58:08,617 --> 00:58:08,884
WATCHING? 

1908
00:58:08,884 --> 00:58:10,787
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY 

1909
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,088
INTERESTING. 

1910
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:15,024
THERE ARE TWO CANDIDATES ON THE 

1911
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:15,424
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 

1912
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:16,926
DELAWARE REPUBLICANS HAVE ONLY 

1913
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:17,459
TWO STATEWIDE OFFICES. 

1914
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:18,294
IT'S ALL DEMOCRAT HERE. 

1915
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:19,929
SO THE FACT THAT THERE COULD BE 

1916
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,397
AN UPSET ON THIS -- ON THE 

1917
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:22,598
DEMOCRAT SIDE WITH THE 

1918
00:58:22,598 --> 00:58:23,866
INCUMBENT, IF YOU LOOK TOWARD 

1919
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:25,468
THE REPUBLICAN, YOU HAVE A 

1920
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,236
SUSSEX COUNTY WHICH IS THE 

1921
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,938
LOWER COUNTY IN DELAWARE ALONG 

1922
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:29,372
THE BEACHES. 

1923
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,007
YOU HAVE A COUNTY COUNCILMAN OR 

1924
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,009
A CITY COUNCILMAN THERE WHO 

1925
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,277
ACTUALLY STUMPED FOR TRUMP TWO 

1926
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,279
YEARS AGO AND COORDINATED PART 

1927
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,380
OF THAT CAMPAIGN. 

1928
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,686
AND THEN YOU HAVE A NORTHERN 

1929
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,888
DELAWARE CANDIDATE WHO ALSO IS 

1930
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:46,522
AN LBGTQ CANDIDATE, OPENLY-

1931
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:46,955
DECLARED CANDIDATE. 

1932
00:58:46,955 --> 00:58:47,857
SO THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD 

1933
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,559
POSSIBLY HAPPEN HERE FOR A 

1934
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,360
STATE THAT USUALLY HASN'T BEEN 

1935
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:50,693
PROGRESSIVE. 

1936
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:54,831
THIS COULD BE, YOU KNOW, A VERY 

1937
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,032
INTERESTING TURN OF EVENTS 

1938
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:56,532
HEADING INTO NOVEMBER. 

1939
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:57,400
WE'LL KNOW QUICKLY BECAUSE 

1940
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,601
DELAWARE TURNOUT IS ALWAYS VERY 

1941
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,169
LOW IN A MIDTERM ESPECIALLY. 

1942
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,638
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE OUR VOTE 

1943
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,539
COUNT VERY EARLY ON THIS 

1944
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,208
EVENING AND KNOW WHAT'S 

1945
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:05,508
HAPPENING. 

1946
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,143
>> INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SAY 

1947
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:07,343
THAT. 

1948
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,379
INTERESTING TO SAY ABOUT THE 

1949
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,046
HEAT BECAUSE WEATHER DOES 

1950
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:10,413
AFFECT TURNOUT. 

1951

2075
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,336
IS THE WILLEY WONKA OF COFFEE, 

2076
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,605
ALMOST 30,000 SQUARE FEET AND 

2077
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:25,441

IN AWE OF WHAT WE CREATED. 

2082
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:33,816
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ADD 

2083
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:34,383
SOMETHING TO THE MILANESE 

2084
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,319

2086
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:37,853

WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE ITALIAN 

2092
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:46,729

2093
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:52,235
THIS PITCH TO THEM WHY YOU'RE 

2094
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:52,735

>> WELL, CLEARLY EVERYTHING 

2096
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,205
THAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE 

2097
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,875
YEARS IS STEEPED INTO THE -- 

2098
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,010
WHAT THE ITALIANS REFER TO AS A 

2099
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,444
NECTAR OF THE GODS WHICH IS 

2100
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:02,711
ESPRESSO. 

2101
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:06,582

2102
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,184
INTEGRITY OF STARBUCKS COFFEE, 

2103
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,652
FRESHLY ROASTED IN THIS 

2104
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:10,720
FACILITY, MADE BY PEOPLE WHO 

2105
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,588
CARE SO MUCH ABOUT CUSTOMER 

2106
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,090
SERVICE AND THE EXPRESSION OF 

2107
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,124
COFFEE AND THE PASSION AND THE 

2108
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,292
LOVE, AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE 

2109
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,760
GOING TO SEE THAT THE PROOF OF 

2110
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,395

SURPRISED AT THE QUALITY OF 

2113

2114
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:25,067
THIS ENVIRONMENT -- YOU KNOW, 

2115
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,703

2117
01:03:28,804 --> 01:03:29,772

AND YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH A 

2125
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:44,220
CALFENNATED BANG, BUT IT RAISES 

2126
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,722
THE QUESTION, WHAT'S NEXT FOR 

2127
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:46,922
YOU? 

2128
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:48,558
ARE YOU CONSIDERING POLITICS? 

2129
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,859
>> WELL, I KIND OF EXPECTED 

2130
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,227
THIS QUESTION, NORAH, SO, YOU 

2131
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,628
KNOW, WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR 

2132
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:53,996
THE LAST FEW MONTHS IS THAT I 

2133
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,133
TOOK THE SUMMER OFF FOR THE 

2134
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,367
FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS. 

2135
01:03:58,367 --> 01:03:59,402
I'VE JUST FINISHED WRITING A 

2136
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,704
VERY IMPORTANT BOOK THAT I'VE 

2137
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,072
HANDED IN TO RANDOM HOUSE. 

2138
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,507
IT'LL COME OUT IN '19. 

2139
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,875
I'M THINKING ABOUT A LOT OF 

2140
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,210
THINGS. 

2141
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,412
I SAID PUBLICLY THAT PERHAPS 

2142
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,413
ONE OF THEM WILL BE PUBLIC 

2143
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:10,646
OFFICE. 

2144
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,214
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I 

2145
01:04:12,214 --> 01:04:13,983
COULD DO PERHAPS TO HELP THE 

2146
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,585
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HELP PEOPLE 

2147
01:04:16,585 --> 01:04:17,954
WHO ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY 

2148
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:18,988
THIS ADMINISTRATION BY NOT 

2149
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:19,889
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. 

2150
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:20,322
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. 

2151
01:04:20,322 --> 01:04:21,624
>> WELL, BACK HERE AT HOME 

2152
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,160
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK BECAUSE 

2153
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,594
SOMEONE FROM INSIDE THE TRUMP 

2154
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:28,231
ADMINISTRATION HAS RELEASED AN 

2155
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,065
OP-ED, ESSENTIALLY TALKING 

2156
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,400
ABOUT BEING PART OF A 

2157
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,069
RESISTANCE EVEN THEY ARE A 

2158
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,070
TRUMP POLITICAL APPOINTEE, BUT 

2159
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,104
SPECIFICALLY THAT THIS 

2160
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,205
PRESIDENT IS AMORAL, THAT HE 

2161
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,674
DOES NOT HAVE A ROOTING THAT 

2162
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,107
DEFINES HIS BELIEF. 

2163
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:43,846
DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S TIME THAT 

2164
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:44,479
THIS COUNTRY MAKES A CHANGE? 

2165
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:48,017
>> WELL, WHAT I DO THINK IS 

2166
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,118
THAT I THINK THE AMERICAN 

2167
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,353
PEOPLE ARE SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED 

2168
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,121
BY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE 

2169
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,322
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND 

2170
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:53,723
A HALF. 

2171
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,892
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE LONGING 

2172
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,327
NOT ONLY IN THE U.S. BUT AROUND 

2173
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,997
THE WORLD -- I MEAN, ITALY, AND 

2174
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,366
I THINK IT IS A WORLDWIDE 

2175
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,667
DESIRE FOR TRUTH, FOR CIVILITY, 

2176
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:08,904
FOR DECENCY, AND I THINK THE 

2177
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:10,273
WORLD IS HUNGRY FOR THE 

2178
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:10,773
IDEALISM OF AMERICA AND 

2179
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,208
AMERICA'S STANDING IN THE 

2180
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:12,441
WORLD. 

2181
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,176
SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY 

2182
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:15,444
IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THE 

2183
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,047
COUNTRY, AND I GAVE A TALK LAST 

2184
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,248
NIGHT, AND I SAID WE HAVE TO 

2185
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,917
ASK OURSELVES WHAT KIND OF 

2186
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,051
COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN, 

2187
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,488
WHAT KIND OF WORLD DO WE WANT 

2188
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:25,854
TO LIVE IN. 

2189
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:27,656
AND AS CITIZENS, NOT ONLY AS 

2190
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:28,557
POLITICIAN, BUT AS CITIZENS AND 

2191
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,661
PARENTS, THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR 

2192
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:32,928
ANY OF US TO BE A BYSTANDER, TO 

2193
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:35,331
BE INDIFFERENT, BUT TO MAKE A 

2194
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:36,331
DIFFERENCE AND TO BE HEARD. 

2195
01:05:36,331 --> 01:05:38,367
>>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND 

2196
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:38,634
I.C.E. 

2197
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,202
ARE DEMANDING TO SEE MILLIONS 

2198
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,103
OF VOTING RECORDS IN NORTH 

2199
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:41,737
CAROLINA. 

2200
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,673
THE SUBPOENAS INCLUDE ALL 

2201
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,508
RECORDS FROM THE STATE'S 

2202
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,542
ELECTIONS BOARD AND OTHERS, 

2203
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:47,476
INCLUDING POLL BOOKS AND 

2204
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:48,711
ABSENTEE BALLOTS FROM THE PAST 

2205
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:49,078
EIGHT YEARS. 

2206
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,479
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THE FEDERAL 

2207
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,516
GOVERNMENT IS MAKING THE 

2208
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,051
REQUEST, BUT IT FOLLOWS CHARGES 

2209
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,253
AGAINST 19 NON-CITIZENS FOR 

2210
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,954
ALLEGEDLY VOTING IN THE 2016 

2211
01:05:58,954 --> 01:05:59,588
ELECTION. 

2212
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:01,257
THE REQUEST IS RAISING PRIVACY 

2213
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:02,057
CONCERNS AMONG VOTER RIGHTS 

2214
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:02,458
GROUPS. 

2215
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,226
NEARLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE ARE 

2216
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,430
ESTIMATED TO HAVE VOTED IN 

2217
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,930
NORTH CAROLINA IN 2016. 

2218
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,066
A TOTAL OF 41 VOTES WERE DEEMED 

2219
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:11,367
POTENTIALLY SUSPECT AFTER A 

2220
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:11,700
STATE AUDIT. 

2221
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,701
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 

2222
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:14,103
CONSIDERING COMMUTING THE 

2223
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,839
SENTENCE OF A MAN SENTENCED TO 

2224
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,742
LIFE IN PRISON DUE TO MANDATORY 

2225
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:20,476
MINIMUM SENTENCING GUIDELINES. 

2226
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,711
HE MET YESTERDAY WITH KIM 

2227
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:24,313
KARDASHIAN, HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA 

2228
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,916
AND JUDGE KEVIN SHARP WHO GAVE 

2229
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,751
THE 22-YEAR-OLD CHRIS YOUNG THE 

2230
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,152
LIFE SENTENCE ON THREE STRIKES 

2231
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:30,452
CONVICTION. 

2232
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:31,854
WELL, YOUNG'S TWO PRIOR DRUG 

2233
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:32,989
FELONIES WERE ACTUALLY MINOR 

2234
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,757
CASES, AND SHARP SAYS HE HAD NO 

2235
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,826
CHOICE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY 

2236
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,993
THE LAW WAS WRITTEN. 

2237
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:42,264
AND HE'S NOW FIGHTING ON 

2238
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:42,631
YOUNG'S BEHALF. 

2239
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:43,933
HE SPOKE TO CBS NEWS. 

2240
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,734
>> WAS GUT WRENCHING TO DO THAT 

2241
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:48,304
AND TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS 

2242
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,539
NOTHING THAT I COULD DO. 

2243
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:51,573
THIS WAS JUST A FORMALITY. 

2244
01:06:51,573 --> 01:06:53,109
AND AS CHRIS SPOKE BEFORE I 

2245
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,243
SENTENCED HIM, HE'S TALKING 

2246
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:55,678
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT HE 

2247
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,880
WOULD DO, AS IF SOME DAY HE'S 

2248
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,114
GOING TO GET OUT. 

2249
01:06:59,114 --> 01:07:00,883
BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT 

2250
01:07:00,883 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING
