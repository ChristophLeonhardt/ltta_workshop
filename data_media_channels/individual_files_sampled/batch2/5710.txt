charlottesville in parts of Northern Virginia are going to be under a state of emergency this weekend governor of North and they're issuing the declaration over concerns of possible unrest is that city marks one year since a white supremacist rally left one person dead violence broke out in the city is white supremacist Klan members white nationalist neo-nazis March - voice their support for their movement also to protest the city's plan a removal of a statue of Robert Ely the group unites the right had been denied permission to march this year in Charlottesville today however the group was granted a permit to hold a rally in DC I want to put in Charlamagne tha God he is of course the wildly popular host of The Breakfast Club on power 105.9 radio here in New York City point one mr. Melton's me point one I always get it wrong but I do listen I do listen yes I want to play something that the president said this of course got a lot of attention right after the rally is president John I think there's blame on both sides you look at both sides I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any doubt about it either and if you reported it accurately you would say blame on both sides when you heard that what you think question um now with him not wanting to denounce his base you know a base full of racist a base full of bigots the base full of prejudice people's we didn't want to denounce them cuz he knows if anybody shows up for him it's gonna be those people that's what that was you think that was that was not even so much a dog whistle just a megaphone yeah that was not a dog well so that was hey don't blame my people for this it's blame on both sides know it wasn't the blame goes to the people that were there to cause harm to people that day to blame goes to the people that were there being prejudiced that day to bigots to racists like that's what the blame goes to a year later where do you think we are in this country you're after Charlottesville I think right now we're in that same place I think the energy has gotten worse you know I think that the mask has been pulled off America you know I think that you know when Donald Trump makes statements like that he gives license the people to keep the racism going there with the wave that bigoted flag high so I think it's just as just as worse if not more worse just last week there's a group of pastors black pastors who met with the president at the White House this is this is the comments that one of the pastors made who's in attendance Nicholas this is probably going to be the man I'm saying this at this table the most Pro black president that we've had in our lifetime because and I try to you know and analyze the people that I encounter this president actually wants to prove something to our community our faith-based community and I at the community the president has uh has not polled well with African Americans in he took office if you look a little German poll you talk to a lot of folks on the video do you get the sense that that's changing at all absolutely not pastor Daryl Scott has a lot of die in his hair the dyes get into his brain so it's causing them to say things that is simply not true like Donald Trump Donald Trump actually has policies that are hurting African Americans you know when you are in the White House and you're trying to reverse everything that Barack Obama has done Barack Obama's policies directly did affect a lot of African Americans you know when it comes to education when it comes to immigration you know when it comes to the environment like the things that Donald Trump is doing is actually hurting African Americans so I don't see how he could ever be the most Pro black president of any lifetime LeBron James this this this dust-up that happened well I was on vacation last week as you know he opens this this public school in Akron Ohio for at-risk young people free tuition free meals transportation access to food pantries for needy families the president commenting after he sees LeBron on on CNN quote LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television Don Lemon he made the brown look smart which isn't easy to do I like Mike you see something like that from from this president then you you know he's referred to Maxine Waters on more than one occasion as a low IQ individual he's made other comments that the S whole countries do you get the sense that the president just doesn't kick doesn't care what black and brown people think about him or his policies or you think there's more to it than that Kanye West said George Bush doesn't care about black people yeah Donald Trump doesn't care about black people that's all it boils down to but you saw the group of pastors there sitting around the 10 that means nothing I mean you know a lot of those pastors you know they they feel like they were walking in faith a lot of them feel like you know God told them to be there and they felt like they could get through to him yeah I can understand why they would feel that way you know if Kim Kardashian you can get through the Donald Trump I can understand if you're a pastor or a man of the cloth why you feel like you can get through to him but that's just for photo ops like he does that for things like this you don't think he knew the one-year anniversary of charlottesville was coming up and he wants to look like he's in the good graces of some black people in our community so you get to people who are you know foolish enough in a sense are feel like they can make some change happen to come to the White House and you take a photo op with them o Nashville police before let's get out of here you've probably seen this Nashville police they just released some surveillance video and it shows something that we have unfortunately seen far too often in this country it shows an officer chasing and then fatally shooting another black man we've seen that scene repeated time and time again mm-hmm what's got to change what's got to change that we meet we need more people from the community and police uniforms you know we need people that are from the community that are of the culture that are people of color who know that you know lo Tyrone on the corner isn't a threat because you know why because you know lo Tyrone you mean no no Tyrone since he was a kid you know lo Tyrone's parents you know you know you probably went to school with little Tyrone's parents like when you interact with black and brown people on a regular basis and you know how to act with black and brown people on a regular basis the only people that think that we're threats are the people that don't deal with us on a regular basis that's it simply having you thank you my
