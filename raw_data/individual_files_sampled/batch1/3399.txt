Big Mac McNuggets fries everyone knows these McDonald's menu items unfortunately these aren't their healthiest options maybe that's not a huge surprise but what are the healthiest things you can get at McDonald's we asked Samantha Peyser a registered dietician for her thoughts let's start with breakfast with its high calorie count and sodium content you should probably avoid a breakfast sandwich like the sausage egg and cheese McGriddle instead try the fruit and maple oatmeal without brown sugar or go for the fruit and yogurt parfait the USDA suggests adults who are moderately active consumed 2002-2008 hundred calories a day it's also recommended to eat less than 2300 milligrams of sodium a day that means eating just one sausage egg and cheese McGriddle accounts for more than half of your recommended sodium intake too much sodium consumption can lead to high blood pressure heart disease stroke or other serious medical conditions moving on to lunch McDonald's is world famous for its Big Mac roll and special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame-seed bun hey but all those ingredients add up instead try the filet-o-fish or if you're in the mood for a burger get the plain hamburger adding a slice of cheese raises the sodium content but it's still manageable if you're adding to your meal you should probably skip the fries instead go for the apple slices or opted for the side salad fast-food doesn't have to be unhealthy
