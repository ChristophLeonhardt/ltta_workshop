hello and welcome to cross knock we're all things to consider time Peter Lavelle Michael Flynn admits lying to the FBI the reaction of Russia Gators and the liberal media is jubilation but why Flynn's admission in fact deflates the now popular conspiracy theory Krauss some real news i'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security annals we also have Victor or leverage he is a political analyst as well as a leading expert at the center for actual politics and of course we have Dimitri Babak he is a political analyst with Sputnik International all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate Viktor let me go to you first here Michael Flynn I'm not surprised that he admitted to lying to the FBI I think everybody knew that the media had a field day with it they stumbled with it as well what are the implications of this is that at the beginning of something for the end of something to go it's it's the beginning of something that's not very good for the term administration you know looking at it from the point of view of what Flynn actually did wrong all the charged him with was lying you know to the FBI almost a non charge but at the same time they did it because Flynn has decided to flip and he's going to or they expect him to give evidence to give testimony that they will be able to use that rabbit and the his team will be able to use to bring down people closer to Trump and of course from the very beginning their original target was not Flynn it wasn't manna for it it wasn't gates brigades it was purpose of course they don't care about these people and in fact in any other situation in any other election year or post election year nobody would get charged for these types of their attack it is Tom and Miller Miller is not going to stop until he brings down the American okay that's his goal is he gonna get their mark because it seems to me and I talked to some legal people about this is that if there were something more serious there would be some kind of conspiracy because that's what they really want they want a conspiracy Flynn didn't admit to that okay okay well mark yeah what what Flynn admitted to is lying to the FBI his job for doing his job for doing absolutely nothing illegal to do in fact it clears up his what he admitted to in this non in dick meant this plea bargain is he admitted that what he did was done during the transition team when he was doing his job when they were the the formally elected representatives incoming the incoming government is tradition always participates common practice yeah there's been some suggestions that liberals want to charge perhaps Flynn perhaps Kushner Trump's son-in-law under the Logan Act which is in 19th it was it was a law enacted in 1719 John Adams was president it has never been successfully used to prosecute anyone it hasn't even you know demon rod we do know you know that when you had transition teams and we go back to the Kennedy years okay I mean that certainly and well some wrongdoing might have been undone within the incoming Nixon administration in the scuttling a piece of proposal with Vietnam we saw Barack Obama go on his victory lap tour to Europe okay he talked to officials here this is traditional but why is it different in this case well because I don't think it alright that is traditional let's remember that Obama started his term first term in office with this so-called reset of relations with Russia so Trump obviously wanted his own reset and Flynn was working on exactly that talking to the Russian ambassador I was just puzzled you know I read what mr. Flynn is accused of fleeing asked mister T slack that Moscow refrained from escalating the situation in response to sanctions announced by the above administration and of cold whatsit Russia asking it was the United States asking the Russian circuit if Russia escalated was it their goal you know but the real story here gentlemen victory okay but let's get the record straight Vladimir Putin did come out and saying that Russia would have to probably retaliate which is part of diplomatic course and I'm sorry it was for mr. Lavrov and then it was Putin that actually overturned his own foreign minister later but there's another name floating around here and it's Kushner here and and they in in what was revealed about his relationship with Israel during this same time we're pressuring having the United States pressure other countries on the Security Council the United Nations not to vote on a settlement resolution which would be adversely affecting Israel again that doesn't get a lot of media oxygen Viktor for obviously it won't for obvious reasons which we don't even you know you have to state here but we will and the thing is that Kushner is a critical part in this because the American political establishment they really do not want to go they would prefer not to go there out of full impeachment proceedings because that could reveal all kinds of stuff about the Democrats about the Clinton campaign in the deaths of all the young men for this would be a scandal of the skin of the century and not about Trump but about the others so what would they prefer to happen they would prefer the Nixon scenario where essentially they want to have a pressure point against Trump they say okay so we have this against Kushner your son-in-law and and if you do not step down if it not quit we will go after you I think you read what they will say I think it's I think it's plausible but I think it's really risky what do you think mark I mean going after his son-in-law okay do they really want to talk about Israel Israel Israel during the next few months they will try not to talk about this oh they will only point the finger at Russia oh we will try to make sure the commute is that they will pay you an ABC News on this one here go ahead they're not going to follow up on this story because Israel continually medals in u.s. politics at US politicians for us the board both parties I partisan that's why I think it's welcome Israeli you know I wouldn't say control it's not to that extent but a very undue influence over US politics that's the reason the Zionist regime in Israel now the actual details of this that was revealed in what Flynn admitted to is that trumps son-in-law during the transition was Netanyahu asked Kushner who asked Flynn to ask the Russian ambassador and every other ambassador on the Security Council to vote against because UN resolution because the Obama administration is going to abstain that condemned Israel's settlements ie ethnic cleansing in Palestine Russia of course ignored that they did not agree to change from Japan Zemo I think it's important to note that actually the liberal media has been after Jared Kushner for a lot of months now remember the scandal with that Russian law revision itsuka which they tried to blow out of all proportion I mean this ideology the ultra liberal ideology which is now destroying the world it is in fact cover blind they are not Israeli Patriots they're not American patriots they're not European Patriots they want control over the world and in this situation they are ready to sacrifice anyone including Jerrod Blandino I'm not sure that they want to sacrifice I think it's going back to maybe the victors point here it's just basically prodding taunting on Trump they don't want to go through with it they they want the Nixon scenario where he says I don't want to go there I don't want to go that far okay I still think that's kind of dicey because I don't think there's anything more I think it's this is the end of something there's no iceberg under there's no iceberg here it is a dud but for them you see perception is reality in in their in the way they want to paint this to the American public it is real there is no iceberg but to the master in Iraq look it's just the seniority why are they so jubilant it now because fleeing pleaded guilty because he confessed well let me remind you that incident regime to lying to the FBI there's no Russia collusion in this it was one of the legal norms same illegal norms of the of the Soviet regime if you confessed your guilty as status prosecutor general Wyszynski said confession is the queen of proof so you don't have to find proof he confessed that's their what you lying to the FBI we have to remember this an whole thing was whether the trumpet meant another team colluded with Russia to guess not it's this the lens gets blurry depending on how you tournament what what this is actually about the other question is why did Flynn lie to the FBI about doing nothing illegal right so was he was this all just the tip of some hidden Russian collusion iceberg that he's gonna flip on or is this all they have why did he lie I'll tell you why he lied because the Obama the outgoing Obama administration and the media and the deep state colluded to create a witch-hunt atmosphere we talked about this early on their whole goal here is to prevent anything taunts occurring between Russia and the US and to create this neo McCarthyite hysteria where you put people under oath you ask them uncomfortable questions you create a political domestic atmosphere where if you dare say oh I talked to a Russian alright and we already have the transcript so you better get it straight and they they make some little lie that is inconsequential in order to play down the this public four and they get nailed on it which is basically player it was just incompetence at the end of the day look for somebody who headed the US Defense Intelligence Agency yes getting into a story like this shows that he's probably not the most competent intelligence official but then again remember David Petraeus who used to be the head of the CIA and he got into a the most primitive honey trap that ended his career forever so that's how they resurrected him he says one on their team jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with RT welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter belt remind you were discussing some real news okay let me go to mark here we were told by the State Department that after Artie was forced to register as a foreign agent under in the US that it would still be business as usual now we have their accreditation withdrawn from them can't go to Capitol Hill assuming the rest of Washington as well this attack is political it's obvious but very few people are speaking out about this attack on freedom of speech the Western liberal media loves to say that Trump is against freedom of speech but they never stick up for freedom of speech when it is being challenged mark yeah we have this statement out by the US State Department new US legislation that allows the Department of Justice to label media outlets as foreign agents and to monitor Internet activity presents yet another threat to the media in the United States no no I'm sorry actually that was Russian legislation and threat to the media in Russia the US State Department put out the probably I mean it's a new record in hypocritical hypocritic allottee for the US State Department to condemn Russia for a tit-for-tat measure that mirrors exactly what the US Department of Joshua just did to Russia this that they can't they can't even see their own hypocrisy no it's extraordinary fuse to admit it because it's not the same when we do it that's it's not the same this has nothing to do with art he who founds artsy BBC is funded by the British government nobody 24 and nobody to limit their access to American their accreditation to American government institutions like Congress or any other institutions one also has to understand here that this loss of accreditation with the US Congress it has a domino effect because a number of other US institutions they look at accreditations right to see whether the walk there and it's going to have a domino effect where after this loss of accreditation Artie is going to lose a presentation at other places in the u.s. you know today when they may when the American government talks to freedom of speech it means freedom of their speech nobody else's well you know patema I think it's one of the interesting things is yeah I think a lot of our viewers saw the last few days the Guardian ran a pretty large hit piece on on Artie and there is a silver liner lining to all of this all this free advertising I mean it costs so much money I used to be in marketing I mean a brand awareness is really expensive to attain there's been a lot of money we're getting it for free go ahead the Guardians guy took about a week of his time to watch all our programs of Artie I always mentioned picture with nineteen you know I'm flattered but anyway what I want to say is okay Artie was basically forced to register as a foreign agent and we were told by the US media for many years how bad the expression a foreign agent is you know when Russia introduced the foreign agent when legislation then Michael Flynn was forced to confess that he lied about his contacts with the foreign ambassador let me remind you it was dangerous to talk to foreign ambassadors only in two countries in Nazi Germany and in the so between I think now the US government should register as an authoritarian regime because that falls this logic if broadcasting if a foreign broadcaster is a foreign agent if a person talking to a foreign ambassador is a traitor and he pleads guilty then you are an authoritarian government that's that's all let's let's let's review what with the big problem with RT is now if we refer back to this joint three agency intelligence report on Russian hacking they clearly outline the sins that Artie has committed that have led to all of this highlights criticism of alleged u.s. shortcomings in democracy and civil liberties hello the Democratic Party rigging in primary what would birdie zap inion is about aired a documentary about the Occupy Wall Street movement frame the movement as a fight against the ruling class describe the current US political system as corrupt and dominated by corporations oh how far from reality is that alleged widespread infringement of civil liberties surveillance proof police / - a few whistleblowers ok well that's that's simply reporting factual he's huge to us shining city criticism of us economic system us current policy they even alleged Wall Street greed and that the US has national debt yeah like 20 trillion dollars worth of it gree that's a permanent elegent report Wow they sold out did you hear what clapper and others accused us of we sold out about this I call clapping amazing country of ours well there is no doubt that the US has a huge debt right there is no doubt that Wall Street is greedy did anyone have doubts about that Creek criticizing the US now makes you an enemy for an agent here it's go to Europe Viktor agonal in Merkel's having a problem a big problem getting her government together her coalition potential coalition partners SPD they want something the the electorate doesn't want they want more intensive integration of the EU expansion and they want to have a centralized EU budget Merkel is she gonna have to bite because I think the electorate across the entire continent is saying no to everything I just said Angela Merkel was so sure that she would get her fourth term as Chancellor in Germany it was almost like Hillary Clinton yeah thinking its invasion it's inevitable this was the inevitable German iron lady and she now is a serious trouble because she is no longer so inevitable more than that in the past few weeks since this crisis erupted with your not being able to form a new coalition your popularity ratings really have stopped started dropping even more so the German political establishment now realizes that if new elections are called and with each day we guest are they stuck with well here's what they think if new elections are called then those figures that the right-wing alternative for Germany and the left-wing d-link II God they could go even higher and you know just to remind our viewers alternative for Germany got the 11 percent before this was the first time the parts even got into the Bundestag and the lianca got almost 10 percent so it's 20 percent together Wow that's 1/5 they don't have of course that doesn't give them the power to change in here at this point God gives in the pan our potentially determine with the coalition exactly and and they the German political establishment is scared Dima well I think it's a huge humiliation for the Social Democratic Party of Germany because their leader Martin Schulz said lots of times I am NOT going to go into this big coalition I'm not going to go to this big college never ok as I know out into this big coalition so it's a huge humiliation for him but I think it's not the first emulation for SPD basically not don't forget it was the Social Democrats who bombed Yugoslavia in 1999 it was the Social Democrats that first used the German troops abroad after the World War two so if they have one humiliation more it doesn't make any much again it is this establishment they feel they're entitled to rule ok this is and I see this all the way with the whole issues with Briggs it all the way across the continent plus the EU beating up on Poland in an and unn hungry if you deviate from the ideology mister ideology or ideology Critias criticize er this is lately they don't learn from their mistakes they just double down just like the Democrats are in the u.s. Angela Merkel has been in power for more than a decade now all the the and and hurt numbers unlike say Putin's who's been in office as no one cares through notice a similar amount of time are going down less than a third of the a German electorate for her but the German political establishment is scared of change the Social Democrats they originally didn't want to form a new coalition that says Dimas said why because any party including theirs that has been in coalition with Angela Merkel's government has seen their numbers similarly plummet in the polls as votes go right and left but now the SPD is faced with the possibility of another election the German establishment doesn't want this and the SPD doesn't want this the Social Democrats because they know that in a new election they'll lose even more seats to the right and left or you know regardless of whether they form a coalition so this is this is a Stalag major nature they hope that this is going to go away it's not it's not going to go away all across Europe all across the session rights across the Western world they think that this is just some kind of momentary lapse of sanity no this is the new norm and the establishment better start waking up to it mark is right about merkel becoming toxic toxic with the voters I mean the Liberals the free Democratic Party of Germany why did the vote plummet you know when mr. Guido Vester really what was the coalition but because he was in collision with her and now Jamaica coalition failed because the new leader of the free democratic party doesn't want to repeat the fate of mr. Masterman morocco may be toxic with the voters voters but the liberal media and commentariat across the west this doors door I'm getting a raised her the international establishment is forcing this toxic poison I'm down the throat in this part of the program here it's it's not about politics it's about ideology that that's what's really at stake right here because you have these opposing seemingly opposing political parties but at the end of the day they have a common interests maintaining the status quo of course and we actually see them trying to do the same with some Eastern European countries like Hungary and like Coons you know it with now the European Union extreme sanctions imposed sanctions against Poland with constant criticism against the EU sanctions you know what they don't see in the in the times of the Soviet Union in the 60s 70s and 80s there used to be a concept called goulash communism that comes from Hungary what did it actually mean was a hybrid well it was a habit because the Soviets realized that you know each of these countries got their own national culture and they was a little different political culture was different their political roots traditions were different from the Soviet ones today the Americans and the Germans they don't even want to take the run out of town your gentlemen many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching is here RT see you next time and remember cross toggles all right now for the extended version of our program where we talk about political popery mark I know you want to talk about Turkey and Syria go ahead yeah Isis is is all but defeated in Syria but in many ways Isis was the low-hanging fruit they were the one thing that no one could at least publicly agree on that they that they backed I even though we all know Saudi Arabia and Qatar did at least according to Hillary Clinton and US intelligence but we have a problem with al Qaeda firmly in control of it Lib under the new acronym HTS and Turkey the the Turkish regime of Erdogan is now openly military cooperating and coordinating with al Qaeda and we have towards what head what's their goal the u.s. us academics have suggested that in order to prevent civilian casualties I'm thinking of Sam Heller at the Century Foundation they've argued that we should allow al-qaeda to keep control of the entire ad libbed province in order to prevent civilian casualties from taking it back as long as it's done under Turkey's wing to keep it under control this is turkey a lying with al Qaeda basically claiming to partition part of sere said before this is a stalling measure because do not agree because I don't I don't see that this has much of a shelf-life okay you can this cannot because we're not we're looking towards some kind of endgame in Syria we can't have a partner as having Al Qaeda or Isis or anyone else of that ilk as a partner but that is what Astana does it legitimizes the Turkish military presence in Syria and that may have been a strategic decision to stall for time but Aragon doesn't intend to go anywhere and he's partnering with al Qaeda to make his footprint even bigger maybe I will add a few words here looking at the Russian position I think Russia understands and acknowledges that Turkey has some interest in Syria there are there is a Turkish minority their legitimate interests what happened nobody it's it because it's exactly it's the region okay they are simply there I mean we don't want unlike our adversaries we don't want 100% control of our allies in Syria you know over the areas that they have because we understand how they were Syria is what is important is that this week there was this meeting of the Turkish president Iranian president and the Russian president in Sochi and how mad the Western media was they said the West is sidelined the West is only an onlooker yes but who is to blame you they barge lies themselves by stumbling and blundering off and Turkey despite its many scenes since there are there is a Turkish minority in Syria I think Russia acknowledges that okay it's not about a minority in Syria it's about the Kurds okay it's the long and the short about it because because because of what because there are so many Kurds inside of Turkey as well this is what Erina wants greatest nightmare is okay empowering because of the failed attempt to destroy the Syrian government under Assad they have if they have actually empowered the Kurds in Syria itself and by extension into Turkey you know blow back peanut be careful what you wish for here there's also blowback from the failed coup that happened in Turkey last year and there the gun knows very well who was behind that coup it was the Western powers there was 15 there was American involvement there and who helped him through that cool it was Russia so whatever happens from now on of course Turkey is going to play both sides here because that that's its national position considering it's interesting in Syria politic I we do exactly the same exactly but one thing is for sure here the gun is not going to trust the United States he's nothing to touch Germany anytime soon good picture and people trust him it's not so much a matter of trust as a matter of power whoever is the power to make somebody else will never do something they want that power of wins where he has more leverage Dima well I agree with Viktor I think that you know the methods of pressure which the United States applies to her to God independent of whether the nine States was involved or was not involved in the cool I don't know about that but they have this Turkish businessman in the United States he is being charged with helping yes do that but our job that the one that had a trial this this week he is accused of breaching the the Iranian blockade the blockade of Iran and Aragon understands very clearly that there in fact blackmailing him the United States is blackmailing him they set out to to discredit him Russia is not doing such things Russia was very forthright you know like every gun down our plane this is a crime we're happy about that it was quite open we did not use you know the hidden the hidden means the to undermines him so in this situation we now clearly see that Aragon is rather with Iran and with Russia well I think I think it's pictures right I think it's in the it's playing its natural position in the region considering its size its population GDP and its military the second largest one in NATO and and thinking it's going to be a completely loyal ally to to NATO I think is ridiculous because NATO is not very loyal to Turkey alright so I think they're not going to leave that NATO not anytime soon but they will or Syria but they will use their NATO membership as leverage to get what they want from their partners within the Alliance well at the same time working with Iran and Russia and Syria in the region that's a that's rational and everybody understands on both sides whether it's Russia or the United States that peace and the end of civil war in Syria is impossible without turkey being on board so everybody is going to work on them with them one way or another all right general I want to change what's going on and talking about Libya not a whole lot of talk there until they started showing slave markets of course all of us knew that this was going to be the outcome of this illegal regime change in Libya we're talking about it years ago years ago okay and only bring it up because I want to make sure our viewers know what what American foreign policy NATO foreign policy does to a country that was prosperous the richest in Africa probably the most modern as well highest HD I human development in there it has if you like or just like mr. Academy yes I just think it to say a very shameful outcome of a foreign policy that was never well thought out or maybe it really was just destroy the place well let me remind you of what David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy said when they visited yet their deadly he said with my allies of commission NATO success booming lands think about what that really sat on a new course and I mean why aren't they not a wire they're not coming to Libya now that's the question they came in 2011 they said all of these words now six years have passed isn't it about time for Mr Sarkozy and mr. Cameron to try their own medicine leaving Libya for two days you know even the the UN Office on refugees is afraid to establish its office in Libya they have an office in the places like Syria you know and Afghanistan but they are afraid to go to a rapidly running out of time in this segment here picture you know let's talk more about Yemen the most forgotten tragic conflict in the world today it is it is unbelievable what is happening there you won't find that out in the mainstream media they would much prefer to talk about milania's high heels or something like that or the Christmas tree and the White House and why CNN doesn't want to go you know that's not news you know because the junk it's junk it's because the US and UK are active military partners in Saudi invasion blockade and genocide in Yemen it is definitely one of the most under covered news stories in the world today especially in the Western media the only times they usually start to cover it is when the rebels in Yemen actually fired some missiles back at the air attackers it's not that's a way to play it right exactly and when American ships pass Yemen's coast and knowing full well that the United States has marked just correctly pointed out fully supports Saudi Arabia in its genocidal campaign but when you do it like CBS what was it 60 minutes m'as I was left it was it was breathtakingly shameful what they did it's everybody's fault they don't talk about American arms they don't talk about refueling planes in the air this is really and we are we are talking about the situation with a sea Blackie blockade we are talking about the situation where there have been mass epidemics or diseases that have long desired disappeared in most parts of the world in fact yes including the Middle East and and all this is being crushed under the table because by the Western media because they have to support the official line of fighting against Houthi rebels who are supposedly you know allied with you know team a this is the Yemen is being punished because they want to go after Iran is that the real narrative here well of course to support the the United States got really confused I mean certainly that's an understatement that's an understatement years in the United States the former leader of yeah the former leader of Yemen the former dictator we have been actually he is now pledging to have negotiations he was on the Houthi side during these months now he wants negotiations and the coalition headed by the Saudi Arabia mediately praised him as you know a person who is making peace proposals whose side is doing the United States on they harbor this guy Saleh then salad became the the reason the reason for the bombardment now select is again you know trying to negotiate a inter house arrest in Saudi Arabia yes and basically and now the United States is is shot in its eyes to some very dubious practice of the new crown prince of Saudi Arabia who put several people into gilded cages in the ritz-carlton and suddenly they started to cough up billions you know these former allies of the United States so I mean all of this is so embarrassing that I understand why the US media prefers the Christmas tree in the White House and Melania say well no they don't they don't want to they don't want to they're not told because that they understood that they wouldn't understand that the u.s. is culpable in committing massive war crimes and Hugh meant a humanitarian crisis and I think it's really shameful the Western media doesn't give it more attention but then again they would find them there they themselves or vote for this all right gentlemen that's all we have time for for this segment here I hope you've enjoyed this extended version of cross talk and remember cross stop rules
