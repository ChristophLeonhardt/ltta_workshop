00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,300
today until I changed my mind at a very

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,160
very very last minute late on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday</font>

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,379
night<font color="#E5E5E5"> and decided to upload this instead</font>

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,570
every time I post a video but like my

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,000
feelings and my anxieties or in any way

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">expressed those on the internet there</font>

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,320
were so many of you who are like me to i

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
feel exactly the same way where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel</font>

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,670
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar i also know a lot of</font>

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have graduated and over this weird</font>

12
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,529
disgusting limbo whole thing or you were

13
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,609
just in that stage in your career

14
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,289
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the economy is liking</font>

15
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,689
you know that sort of stuff and I had

16
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">this realization today which came the</font>

17
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,280
very end of a week of panic attacks and

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,890
just things that I've never experienced

19
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,390
before I have felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> that inability to</font>

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,610
breathe in that complete constriction

21
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,739
and tension everywhere I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that often</font>

22
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,840
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact more than I should but it was</font>

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,180
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad this week it was it came out</font>

24
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,530
of nowhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> it felt like it came out of</font>

25
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">nowhere and every time I even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font>

26
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,230
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a</font>

27
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,149
conversation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> K on the bus about</font>

28
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,460
very you know basic things I just

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,809
couldn't deal with it I felt really

30
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,489
packing already stressed and wherever I

31
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,930
watched television programs which

32
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,750
involved casual characters making stupid

33
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,129
decisions I felt the stress of that

34
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,320
stupid decision more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should and</font>

35
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">two everything's just heightened this</font>

36
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,729
week and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally realized like an hour</font>

37
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,650
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the reason that was is because</font>

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am too busy playing ahead like in my</font>

43
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,320
plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose or at least I've always</font>

44
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,000
thought you've had to make plans I don't

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,170

46
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,820
they aim high because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,190
early i'm so lucky that I was driven

68
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,590
from a young age now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder whether I</font>

69

have to learn or maybe they<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn at</font>

70

that age<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is that kind of be a</font>

71
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,560
little more laid back or do I have to

72
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,180
behave more like I should have behaved

73
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,280
them to like balance everything out to

74
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,680
make like an equilibrium what of it all

75
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,710
I I honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know as I say I have</font>

ambitions have ambitions for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

77
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,370
and for my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my career and my</font>

78
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,220
career creatively as well which isn't

79
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,960
completely distinct from my career i

80
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,690
also have ambitions because i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

81
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and see my family in Mexico and I want</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that now I realize a lot of it is</font>

90
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,800
because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been living in the future</font>

91
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,650
and not letting myself just be in

92
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,680
January for a second and partly probably

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,290
because I hate January hopefully a lot

94
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,989
