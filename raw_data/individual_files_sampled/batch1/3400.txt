one thing that people will try to do which can frequently backfire on them is to book flights on different airlines so they'll book airline a for the first leg of their trip and airline B for the second leg and what frequently happens is that you'll miss that connection to airline B what happens then is neither airline will take responsibility for getting you to your final destination and you'll need to rebook at your own cost so you really want to avoid booking flights with connections on different airlines I would stick with American based Airlines as much as I could or their partners because you know that they are flying with certain safety and security standards I think a good rule of thumb is to avoid those places where there may be hotspots of terrorism or other safety issues so plan your itinerary so that you're not stopping in those places if you don't need to one thing that people may want to consider is talking to a travel agent because travel agents can be a great resource in helping people navigate complex itineraries and keeping you out of harm's way
