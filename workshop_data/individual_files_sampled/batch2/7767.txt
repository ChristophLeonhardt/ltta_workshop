California malls are sharing some of the license plate information that they've aggregated with ice this is a strange story but it's happening and it should concern anyone who's concerned about or worried about the government spying in on us or tracking us or becoming too large so in this case a chain of California shopping centers appears to be sharing its license plate reader data with an ice contractor giving that agency the ability to track license-plate numbers it captures in near real-time okay so just to give you some more specific detail into this the company that ice has contracted with is known as vigilant solutions so a vine company shares that data with vigilant solutions a private surveillance tech company that sells automated license plate recognition equipment to law enforcement and government agencies in this case specifically ice ice has finalized its contract with vigilant solutions or had in January of this year so sometimes ice will show up to places and you wonder how they got there and just and sometimes they've gone after people who've made political speeches against the government and they're like haha you're undocumented and somehow they show up at the speech etc and there might be a great variety of reasons for that but reading this story though maybe this is one of the reasons and we didn't know to what degree they're collecting people's information and look we've now done a couple stories where they accidentally rounded up American citizens too and so there's a lot of reasons why people want to abolish ice but now if you're I don't think this is purely a liberal issue if you're a libertarian or you're conservative and you care about your privacy and you're worried about big government they're gathering up and by the way some of the the private company guys are making money off of it too they're gathering up all your private information and they're sending it they're not sending the license plate of just undocumented people they're sending the license plate of all the people to mall now if you just went to the mall you ain't got a ice-cream cone nobody cares and you think what's the big deal now guys out there and women might be different but have you went and gotten illegal marijuana somewhere okay or maybe illegal marijuana depending on the state that you're in Gondo maybe a massage parlor and the list goes on and on and on and they have your license plate but don't worry big government won't use it against you probably but like even if you haven't done anything wrong are you okay with a government agency that's meant to deal with immigration constantly keeping track of where you are are you comfortable I'm not even comfortable with these you know tech companies aggregating this data and then selling it for billions of dollars I mean this should all concern you I mean especially if you're a person who thinks that the government is too powerful and you want to do whatever you can to dial that back this is the definition of big government so yeah and let alone the bad actors that will invariably get into the system because they're human beings so whether it's some guy the private company that's collecting your information or the government what if it turns out they know you and they're like hey I know that license plate and I know I know the other one and they catch you're having an affair they tell your wife because they want to sleep with your wife I don't know I know there's a million scenarios Trump would do but she did do that's right he did it to his friends because he's a terrible terrible human being so you know that's why we you don't want big government that's why our Constitution protects us against it saying they should not be unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant but they don't have warrants for any of this stuff there's no reason to suspect you but they're collecting your information anyway and what if one of those guys doesn't like you and and wants to use it against you not officially but unofficially or leaks it etc etc and that's why you're not supposed to use it get information without a warrant and by the way bread Cavanaugh the Trump Supreme Court pick has said that the government collecting metadata on you is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment even though it is clearly on its own on its face clear reading of the languages it's a violation before the amendment he goes yeah but the government's doing it and I like the government so yeah I'm gonna let him collect all your information well he likes the government when there's a Republican in power I'm sure that he might have a change of heart if there's a Democratic president who's sanctioning this type of behavior yeah but either way and Rand Paul you know says oh yeah I'm concerned about that he's gonna vote for Brett Kavanaugh already there's reports out that he that he'll put up a mild fight and then vote for him of course of course he will because they're all hypocrites they're for the powerful and and and they don't care about you and so the minute Cavanaugh got into the Bush administration he said oh the president should be untouchable right and now he's a judge he's like well the government should be untouchable we should get all of your information and you should know nothing about us two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit the
