IS COOPERATING AND KEEP HIM HERE. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. JOINING US WITH MORE ARE THE AUTHORS OF THE BOOK, LET TRUMP BE TRUMP, THE INSIDE STORY OF HIS RISE TO THE PRESIDENCY. FOX NEWS NEW CONTRIBUTOR AND FORM TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WAS SAD. I HAD SEEN AND FOLLOWED CLOSELY FOR SO MANY MONTHS ALL OF THE WRONGS AND ALL OF THE BIASES THAT WERE SO OBVIOUS. THEN IN THE END, AFTER THE HUGE REPORT WE GOT. THEY KEPT THEIR PERSONAL BIASES AT THE DOOR. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON. THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GOOD STUFF THE PRESIDENT IS DOING. DAVID YOUR TAKE? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AGENT STRZOK NEEDS TO BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY. HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON INTERVIEW AND IN HUMA ABEDIN'S INTERVIEW AND MIKE FLYNN'S INTERVIEW. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS HE IS THE CENTER OF THIS. HE IS CLEARLY BIASSED AND HATED THIS PRESIDENT AND STILL DOES TO THIS DAY. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS HE IS STILL EMPLOYED BY THE FBI. DID THE JUDGE WHO SHOULD THE FISA WARRANT KNOW HE WAS INVOLVED? WAS HE INVOLVED WITH LEAKING THE MANAFORT INFORMATION? 2 YEARS AGO THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING ON 2 YEARS IN AUGUST. HE WAS INVOLVED. 11 DAYS LATER. WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A LEAK OF THE MANAFORT INFORMATION. THIS IS A VERY BAD GROUP WITHIN THE FBI THAT HAS GIVEN THEM THIS. WE ALL KNOW THIS. WHAT DAVID SAID IS NOTHING THAT NOT OBVIOUS. YET TONIGHT PAUL MANAFORT WAS ORDERED TO JAIL. THIS GUY DID NOT WORK FOR THE FBI. HE WAS NOT BIASSED OR HANDLING HILLARY CLINTON AND THE ANTI-TRUMP AND EXPOSING HIS BIASES. MANAFORT IS GOING TO JAIL. HE HAS A $10 MILLION BOND. HOW DO YOU LEVEL THIS OUT IN YOUR MIND THAT WE'VE GOT SUCH A GREAT SYSTEM? THE REAL PROBLEM WE HAVE. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING WHICH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSES TO COVER. HILLARY CLINTON TOOK CLASSIFIED EMAILS ON AN UNCLASSIFIED SERVER AND THEY WERE HACKED OR ACCESSIBLE BY A FOREIGN ENTHIT. ENTITY. THINK EVERYTHING YOU WANT ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT. WE ARE NOT THE BEST OF FRIENDS BUT THE FACT THAT PAUL MANAFORT WENT OFF TO JAIL WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WALKS FREE. IT SAYS IN THE REPORT SOMEONE ACCESSED THAT SERVER FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY. WHY IS THAT NOT A CRIMINAL ACT? BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MAKE A DARN BIT OF DIFFERENCE. I WANT TO KNOW WHO WILL PROSECUTE HER? LET ME GO NOW TO DAVID. WE HAVE THE WORLD CUP. THE PRESIDENT HAD A GREAT WEEK. KIM JONG-UN AGREED TO DENUCLEARIZATION. OBAMA SAID I WILL GET THE WORLD CUP AND I WILL GET THE OLYMPICS HERE. HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING. LOOK, HE HAD A GREAT WEEK. THE PRESIDENT IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT WEEKS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION. JOB NUMBERS TODAY UNBELIEVABLE. LOWEST IN 44 YEARS. OUR ECONOMY IS HUMMY. HUMMING. THE PRESIDENT GOT ELECTED BECAUSE HE SAID JOBS, JOBS, JOBS BECAUSE HE SAID JOBS, JOBS, JO S JOBS, AND HE MEANT IT. A GREAT WEEK ON THE ECONOMIC AND DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA ON DENUCLEARIZATION. THE WORLD CUP, THE GUY WHO USED TO BE THE HEAD OF THE AMERICAN WORLD CUP SAID OH BOB, OBAMA WILL GET THIS NOW. IN 2016, OH, WE CAN'T HAVE DONALD TRUMP. THE CUP WILL NEVER COME HERE. HE PROVES EVERYBODY WRONG. SO, CORY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO PREDICTED NUCLEAR WAR AND THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING. ASIDE FROM ALL OF THAT, I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. I WILL VEER OFF FOR A SECOND. HOW DOES THIS GUY FLY BACK AND FORTH TO SINGAPORE AND DO ALL OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND HE IS WALKING OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY JUST GREETING A PUNCH OF PRESS PEOPLE AND ANSWERING PRESS PEOPLE. ON TOP OF HIS GAME. HOW DOES HE DO? DONALD TRUMP IS A MACHINE. I MEAN THAT. I SPENT THOUSANDS OF HOURS WITH HIM. HE NEVER SLEEPS. HE CONTINUES TO WORK. THAT'S WHY THE FIRST 18 MONTHS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, HE'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL. LOOK AT WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT. 4% GROWTH. THEY SAID YOU WILL NEVER GET THERE. NOW THE FED SAYS 4.8%. HE NEVER GIVES UP. WE WALKED OUT AND DID THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH FOX. I AM SURE THE STAFF SAID DON'T DO THAT. DONALD TRUMP IS HIS BEST WHEN HE IS DONALD TRUMP. THE BOOK THAT DAVE AND I WROTE IS WHY HE IS SUCCESSFUL. HE DOES THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE NORM. STAYED UP FOR 25 HOURS STRAIGHT ON THAT AIRPLANE. GOT OFF THE PLANE AND KEPT ON WORKING. HE DIDN'T GO TO BED FOR A WEEK LIKE HILLARY CLINTON DID BEFORE THE DEBATE. SHE WAS IN BED FOR LONGER THAN THAT. HE DOESN'T DRINK COFFEE? NO, YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP. NO COFFEE. DIET COKES. IT'S RAW ADRENALINE AND DIET COAX. COKES. HE WEARS OUT THE STAFF. HE HAS A DIFFERENT GEAR THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. INCLUDING THE STAFF. THIS GUY WORKS 20 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK. THAT'S WHY OUR ECONOMY IS MOVING. PEOPLE WONDER HOW COULD HE DO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS? IT'S BECAUSE HE NEVER STOPS. A SMART AND DILIGENT GUY. DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB AS PRESIDENT. AND NOT ONLY THAT CELEBRATED HIS BIRTHDAY THIS WEEK TOO. THAT'S RIGHT. JUDGE, THE PRESS NEVER COMPLAINS THAT THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT DOING ENOUGH. THEY COMPLAIN THEY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THEM. A FAR CRY FROM OBAMA WHO DID NOTHING FOR 8 YEARS. WE USED TO TALK ABOUT 24/7
