THE HOUSE, SO ARE THEY RIGHT?

PENNSYLVANIA, NEBRASKA, IDAHO

15
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:38,904
AND OREGON.

16
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,340
THE POLLS CLOSE IN LESS THAN AN

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,040
HOUR IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HER

HOPES TO BEAT FELLOW REPUBLICAN

21
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,150
JIM CHRISTIANA IN THE PRIMARY

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,185
THERE AND THE WINNER WILL GO UP

23
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:54,553
AGAINST INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC

24
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:56,955
SENATOR BOB CASEY, THE KC NAME

25
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,557
OBVIOUSLY IS STORIED AND HAS A

26
00:00:58,557 --> 00:00:59,424
LONG HISTORY IN PENNSYLVANIA, SO

27
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:01,693
THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE

28
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,395
FOR REPUBLICANS AND IT IS

29
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:05,531
CLEARLY ONE TO WATCH.

30
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:07,533
HERE NOW, POLITICAL EXPERT

31
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,535

WAIT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU TONIGHT.

37
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:17,376
>> HOWDY, MA'AM.

38
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:20,846
>> Martha: CHRIS, LET ME START

39
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:21,547
WITH YOU.

40
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:22,748
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING CLOSELY

41
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,716
TONIGHT?

42
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:25,951
>> WE GOT SIX RACES ON OUR

43
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:28,353
FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS THAT ARE

44
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:30,789
COMPETITIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA.

45
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,557
THAT'S SIX HOUSE RACES.

46
00:01:31,557 --> 00:01:32,925
DEMOCRATS COULD COME OUT OF

47
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,227
THERE WITH AS MANY AS A NET

48
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:35,527
FOUR.

49
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:36,495
REPUBLICANS ARE CEDING A LOT OF

50
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:37,229
TERRITORY BUT IT'S GOING TO

51
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,266
DEPEND A LOT ON HOW THESE

52
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,702
PRIMARY         GO.

53
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:45,737
IT'S A LITTLE HARDER FOR

54
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:47,339
DEMOCRATS TO FLIP AS IN A

55
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:48,340
INCUMBENT REPUBLICAN WHO DOESN'T

56
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,374
HAVE A TON OF BAGGAGE.

57
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:51,176
THEY ARE HAVING A TOUGH PRIMARY.

58
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:53,245
IT'S GETTING BETTER, THE KIND OF

59
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:53,846
CANDIDATES THAT NATIONAL

60
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:55,681
CANDIDATES WANT.

61
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,182
SHE'S A FORMER REPUBLICAN, SHE'S

62
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:57,749
A MODERATE.

63
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,451
A VETERAN, AN ATTORNEY, SHE IS A

64
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:00,118
YOUNG WOMAN BUT SHE IS UP

65
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,388
AGAINST AND ENTRANCED LOCAL

66
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:04,556
FORCE, A TRIAL LAWYER.

67
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:05,924
THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY.

68
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,226
IT'S RACES LIKE THAT THAT WILL

69
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:07,960
DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEMOCRATS

70
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,127
HAVE THE HORSES THEY NEED TO

71
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,095
KNOCK OFF REPUBLICANS AND TURN

72
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,563
IT FROM A GOOD YEAR TO A GREAT

73
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:12,231
YEAR FOR THEM.

74
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,265
>> Martha: ONE OF THE THINGS

75
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:14,366
THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT IS

76
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,235
THAT THERE IS A FLOOD OF

77
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,237
DEMOCRATS IN THESE PRIMARIES AND

78
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:20,572
THE CONCERN FOR YOUR PARTY THAT

79
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:23,141
THERE MAY BE TOO MANY, THAT THEY

80
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:23,909
MIGHT DILUTE EACH OTHERS CHANCES

81
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,811
AND CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

82
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:28,513
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

83
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:29,648
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

84
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,383
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES JUMPING

85
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:35,053
INTO THESE BRACES, THERE ARE

86
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:36,788
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES RUNNING IN

87
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,357
DISTRICTS THAT THE PARTY HASN'T

88
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:39,491
FIELDED A CANDIDATE IN DECADES

89
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:41,159
IN SOME CASES.

90
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,061
I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE ENERGY

91
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:46,031
THAT DEMOCRATS ARE FEELING RIGHT

92
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:46,298
NOW.

93
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:46,899
WE'VE BEEN SEEING THIS

94
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:47,966
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF ALL

95
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,434
THESE SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND NOW

96
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:52,170
THROUGH THE PRIMARY SEASON OR

97
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,007
DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT IS UP.

98
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:57,009
OFTENTIMES SIGNIFICANTLY

99
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,443
OUTPERFORMING WHAT'S BEEN

100
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:00,579
HAPPENING IN THE PAST.

101
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:01,346
>> Martha: LET ME STAY WITH

102
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:03,181
YOU FOR JUST A SECOND.

103
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:03,916
COREY BLISS, INTERESTING FROM

104
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,718
THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP

105
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:07,152
FUND.

106
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:08,553
THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE

107
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:09,588
HOUSE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.

108
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,324
KEVIN McCARTHY AND PAUL RYAN.

109
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:13,392
THEY ARE FEELING PRETTY

110
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:14,726
OPTIMISTIC FROM WHAT THEY ARE

111
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,561
SEEING RIGHT NOW AND HE'S SAYING

112
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:17,930
THAT HIS ADVICE TO DEMOCRATS IF

113
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,764
THEY WANT TO WIN IS DON'T

114
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,632
NOMINATE PROGRESSIVES.

115
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:23,335
DON'T TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AND

116
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,337
DON'T TALK ABOUT RUSSIA.

117
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:26,338
ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT

118
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:26,972
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE

119
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,206
SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON THOSE

120
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,341
THREE THINGS?

121
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:30,876
>> NO, BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY NOT

122
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,911
HEARING THAT FOR MOST DEMOCRATIC

123
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:33,946
CANDIDATES IN THE RACES THAT

124
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:34,579
THEY ARE RUNNING.

125
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,949
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADS THAT MOST

126
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,417
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN THESE

127
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:41,086
COMPETITIVE SEATS ARE RUNNING,

128
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:41,720
THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT

129
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,421
IMPEACHMENT AND THEY ARE NOT

130
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,555
TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA.

131
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,590
THEY ARE TALKING PRIMARILY ABOUT

132
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,559
ECONOMIC ISSUES AND

133
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,794
BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUES AND

134
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:49,695
DRAWING CONTRAST WITH THE

135
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,363
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.

136
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,331
THEY ARE GOING AFTER

137
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,131
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRETTY

138
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:53,832
AGGRESSIVELY BUT THAT'S ONLY

139
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,534
PART OF THE EQUATION FOR THEM.

140
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,868
WE SAW THAT WITH CONOR LAM IN A

141
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,338
SPECIAL ELECTION UPSET EARLIER

142
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,973
THIS YEAR AND WE ARE SEEING IT

143
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:02,941
IN A LOT OF THESE RACES ACROSS

144
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,076
THE COUNTRY.

145
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:04,776
THAT'S WHERE I EXPECT MOST OF

146
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:07,746
THE CANDIDATES IN THESE REAL

147
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,681
SWING DISTRICTS LIKE THE ONE WE

148
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:10,849
ARE SEEING IN PENNSYLVANIA WILL

149
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,149
LAND.

150
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:11,783
>> Martha: REPUBLICANS ARE

151
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:14,619
RAISING A LOT OF MONEY.

152
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:17,990
THAT CLF, $71 MILLION VERSUS

153
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,656
$2 MILLION IN THE SAME CYCLE

154
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,158
LAST TIME AROUND.

155
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,493
THE AMERICAN ACTION FUND HAS

156
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:25,197
SIMILAR GROWTH.

157
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:25,897
CANNOT MONEY PUT THEM OVER THE

158
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,766
TOP AND SOME OF THESE RACES?

159
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,501
>> IT'S GOOD TO HAVE NATIONAL

160
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:29,801
MONEY.

161
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:30,902
NATIONAL MONEY IS GREAT, BUT IT

162
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:32,471
COMES WITH NATIONAL DIRECTION.

163
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,741
BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

164
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:36,742
COMPARABLY THIS YEAR IS THEY

165
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,610
HAVE ON THE RACE BY RACE LEVEL,

166
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,345
DEMOCRATS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE

167
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:42,014
BETTER AT RAISING MONEY ON THE

168
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:42,748
CANDIDATE BY CANDIDATE BASIS.

169
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:45,951
YOU SAW WITH CONNOR LAM VERSUS

170
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,152
RICK, A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE YOU

171
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:50,122
HAD ALL THIS NATIONAL, CORPORATE

172
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,723
MONEY FLOWING THROUGH A BIG

173
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:54,126
SPIGOT TO TRY TO HELP THEM OUT.

174
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,093
CONNOR LAM WAS GETTING DIRECT

175
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,796
MONEY AND GENERALLY, GENERALLY

176
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,297
THERE ARE IDIOTS ON EVERY LEVEL,

177
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:02,367
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE

178
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,135
CANDIDATES CLOSEST -- THE PEOPLE

179
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,670
CLOSEST TO THE RACE ARE BETTER

180
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,671
AT KNOWING WHAT THE RACE NEEDS,

181
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,372
SO THE DEMOCRATS TO HAVE THAT

182
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,074
GOING FOR THEM.

183
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:10,175
>> Martha: CHRIS, WHAT DO YOU

184
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:10,475
THINK?

185
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,744
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS

186
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:16,715
AND THE ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS

187
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,116
HAS NARROWED IN POLLS OVER THE

188
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:20,118
RECENT WEEKS.

189
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,754
IS THAT MEANINGFUL TO YOU?

190
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,356
>> DEMOCRATS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE

191
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,157
LIVING WITH THE FALSE

192
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:25,957
EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE SET AT

193
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,360
THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THINGS

194
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,127
WERE JUST A TOTAL GARBAGE BUYER

195
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,729
FOR THE REPUBLICANS.

196
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,765
IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT FIVE,

197
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:34,266
SIX, SEVEN POINTS.

198
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,434
IT'S BEEN RIGHT IN THAT SPACE ON

199
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:35,767
AVERAGE.

200
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,169
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

201
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,336
IF THE ELECTORAL HELD TODAY THE

202
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:39,738
REPUBLICANS MIGHT LOSE THE

203
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,139
HOUSE, THEY MIGHT KEEP IT BY A

204
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,509
COUPLE SEATS IT WOULD BE ON PAR

205
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,744
WITH WHAT WE HAVE EXPECTED

206
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:46,745
HISTORICALLY TO SEE IN

207
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:47,512
PRESIDENTIAL FIRST-TERM

208
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:47,879
MIDTERMS.

209
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,550
THE AVERAGE LOSS OF SEATS IS 24,

210
00:05:51,550 --> 00:00:00,000
HISTORICALLY SPEAKING.
