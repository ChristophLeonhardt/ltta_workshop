11:15 A.M. EASTERN TIME.
STAY TUNED FOR THAT.
MEANWHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT
PULLING ANY PUNCHES THIS
MORNING AS SENATOR ELIZABETH
WARREN'S BIG DNA REVEAL GOES
BUST.
HER CLAIM OF NATIVE AMERICAN
ANCESTRY SPARKING DEBATE ON THE
LEFT AND PUSHBACK FROM THE
CHEROKEE NATION.
THEY SAID A DNA TEST IS USELESS
TO DETERMINE TRIBAL CITIZENSHIP.
SHE IS UNDERMINING TRIBAL
INTERESTS WITH HER CONTINUAL
CLAIMS OF TRIBAL HERITAGE.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS JOKING THAT
MAYBE ELIZABETH WARREN IS THE
SENATOR'S NICKNAME.
POCAHONTAS IS GETTING SLAMMED.
SHE TOOK A BOGUS DNA TEST AND
SHOWED SHE MAY BE 1/1024.
FAR LESS THAN THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN.
CHEROKEE NATION DENIES HER AND
EVEN THEY DON'T WANT HER, PHONY.
HE WRITES THIS ABOUT WARREN.
NOW THAT HER CLAIMS OF BEING OF

THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
HARVARD CALLED HER A PERSON OF

WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN HER

THIS DNA TEST?
>> THEY'RE JUST SAYING IT'S NOT
HOW IT WORKS IF YOU TRY TO
PROVE NATIVE AMERICAN ROOTS.
SOVEREIGN TRIBAL NATIONS SET
THEIR OWN LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
FOR CITIZENSHIP.
WHILE DNA TESTS CAN BE USED TO
DETERMINE LINEAGE SUCH AS
PATERNITY TO AN INDIVIDUAL IT
IS NOT EVIDENCE FOR TRIBAL
AFFILIATION.
SENATOR WARREN IS SORT OF
CLARIFYING HER CLAIMS NOW.
SHE TWEETED THIS.
I WON'T SIT QUIETLY FOR.
I TOOK A TEST.
DNA AND FAMILY HISTORY HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH TRIBAL
DETERMINATION WHICH IS
DETERMINED ONLY BY TRIBAL
NATIONS.
I RESPECT THE DISTINCTION AND
DON'T LIST MYSELF AS NATIVE IN
THE SENATE.
THAT IS A MUCH DIFFERENT TONE
THAN THE ONE WARREN STRUCK A
