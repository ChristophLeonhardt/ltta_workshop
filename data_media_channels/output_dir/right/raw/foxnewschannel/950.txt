00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,162
THE FACT IS WE REALLY DON'T KNOW

76
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,965
WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS DEAL.

77
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,099
WE HAVE A LATE FRAMEWORK.

78
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,501
ALL OF IT WILL BE WORKED OUT IN

79
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,168
THE DETAILS.

80
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,370
WE WILL NEED TO SEE SUBSTANTIVE

81
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:16,670
TALKS.

82
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,571
WE WILL NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY BUT

83
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,373
IT COULD ACTUALLY TAKE MANY

84
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,274
MONTHS, MANY YEARS TO ACHIEVE

85
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,208
WHAT WE NEED TO SEE.

86
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,576
IT'S A GOOD START AND AT WORST

87
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,345
IT'S A NEUTRAL.

88
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,480
AT BEST IT'S A VERY GOOD START,

89
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,349
BUT WE HAVE TO WORK OUT A LOT OF

90
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:28,749
PARTICULARS.

91
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,651
>> Bret: WHAT STRUCK IN THAT

92
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,018
INTERVIEW?

93
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,953
>> I WAS STRUCK BY THE PRESIDENT

94
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,555
SAYING HE WANTS TO GET U.S.

95
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,956
TROOPS HOME, WHICH I THINK THE

96
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:36,690
NORTH KOREANS HAVE BEEN ASKING

97
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,092
FOR FOR A LONG TIME, LOOKS TO BE

98
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:38,793
A CONCESSION.

99
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:42,329
I WAS ALSO STRUCK BY HIS ANSWER,

100
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,998
OR PROBABLY BETTER PHRASED AS

101
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:44,665
NONANSWER ON HUMAN RIGHTS.

102
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,167
YOU PRESSED HIM ON IT TWICE.

103
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,368
THE FIRST TIME HE SORT OF DODGED

104
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,336
THE QUESTION AND THEN FOUND A

105
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,539
WAY TO PRAISE KIM JONG UN FOR

106
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,107
HIS STRENGTH.

107
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,742
AND THE SECOND TIME HE

108
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,676
DOWNPLAYED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

109
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,077
IN NORTH KOREA BY SAYING

110
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,746
BASICALLY EVERYBODY IS GUILTY OF

111
00:02:58,746 --> 00:02:59,146
SOME THINGS.

112
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,448
HE COULD GO THROUGH A LONG LIST

113
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,750
OF NATIONS THAT HAVE THOSE

114
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,117
PROBLEMS.

115
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:03,884
SO I WAS STRUCK BY THAT.

116
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:07,388
THE OTHER PARTS OF IT I THINK,

117
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:07,888
NORTH KOREA ON THE

118
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,622
DENUCLEARIZATION QUESTION ITSELF

119
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,524
WAS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HE

120
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:10,825
HEARD.

121
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,560
HE'S OBVIOUSLY VERY PROUD OF

122
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,194
HIMSELF.

123
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:13,761
>> Bret: ELI?

124
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,461
>> CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED BUT I

125
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,731
LIKE TO BELIEVE AMERICA IS A

126
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,465
BEACON OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM

127
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,134
AND THAT WHEN THE AMERICAN

128
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,069
ELECTED PRESIDENT MEETS WITH

129
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,939
TYRANTS LIKE KIM JONG UN, THERE

130
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:29,143
SHOULD BE AT THE VERY LEAST

131
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,879
REFRAIN NOT TO GO OUT OF HIS WAY

132
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,947
TO BASICALLY LIE ABOUT THE

133
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:33,948
NATURE OF THIS PERSON.

134
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,249
AT ONE POINT HE SAID IN ANOTHER

135
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,351
INTERVIEW WITH THE NORTH KOREAN

136
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:37,985
PEOPLE LOVED KIM JONG UN.

137
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,755
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE AND IN

138
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,390
YOUR INTERVIEW, THERE'S A LOT OF

139
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,258
BAD PEOPLE THAT DO A LOT OF BAD

140
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:44,792
THINGS.

141
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,095
THAT IS THE SENTIMENT THAT WE

142
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:52,433
NORMALLY ASSOCIATE THAT TRY TO

143
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,103
EXPLAIN AWAY AND RATIONALIZE THE

144
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,072
HORRORS OF THE STALINIST LIKE

145
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:58,572
KIM JONG UN.

146
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,874
AS A GENERAL RULE I DON'T REALLY

147
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,609
LIKE THAT KIND OF THING AND OF

148
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,611
COURSE IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU

149
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,678
GOT A DEAL THAT GOT RID OF

150
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,013
NUCLEAR -- I'M NOT SAYING YOU

151
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,281
DON'T DO DIPLOMACY, BUT I DON'T

152
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,415
THINK THAT TRUMP NEEDED TO GO AS

153
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:12,019
FAR AS HE DID IN HIS FLATTERY.

154
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:12,987
>> I ALSO WISH THAT

155
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,188
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD SPOKEN

156
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,289
AGAINST THE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.

157
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:20,560
>> Bret: HE DID SPEAK, WE ARE

158
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,495
TOLD, IN THE SUMMIT BEHIND

159
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:21,962
CLOSED DOORS.

160
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,497
>> IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT WHAT HE

161
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,565
IS ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE RIGHT

162
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,966
NOW IS A POSITIVE PITCH.

163
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,935
HE'S TRYING TO PAINT A VISION

164
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,138
FOR KIM THAT HE HAS A DIFFERENT

165
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,773
PATH AND HIS GOAL,

166
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,774
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S GOAL, IS TO

167
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,142
MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF

168
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,977
PORTLAND AREN'T BOMBED BY

169
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,345
NORTH KOREA.

170
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,780
YOU HAVE THIS THING WITH

171
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,547
NEOCONSERVATISM MILITARISM FUSED

172
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,050
WITH MORAL IDEALISM THAT SEEKS

173
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,817
TO ACHIEVE EVERYTHING BUT ENDS

174
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,953
UP ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING AND

175
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,855
DOING SO AT A HUGE COST OF BLOOD

176
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:48,355
AND MONEY.

177
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,457
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

178
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,358
WE UNDERSTAND WE HAVE OUR

179
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,159
NATIONAL INTEREST HERE.

180
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,495
WE WANT TO KEEP FROM GETTING

181
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,896
INTO A NUCLEAR WAR AND WE WILL

182
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,399
HOPEFULLY SUBSTANTIVELY DEAL

183
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,133
WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, WHICH

184
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,401
ARE SERIOUSLY NEED TO BE DEALT

185
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:00,701
WITH.

186
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,171
THAT'S NOT OUR FIRST CONCERN.

187
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,773
>> AN OLD NEOCON MILITARIST BY

188
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,608
THE NAME OF RONALD REAGAN

189
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,442
MANAGED TO NEGOTIATE ARMS

190
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,310
CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND HAVE A

191
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,078
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOVIET

192
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,980
PREMIERS AND STILL KEEP A

193
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,115
LASER-LIKE FOCUS ON THE

194
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:15,849
DISSIDENTS WHO WERE ROTTING IN

195
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,552
THEIR GULAGS.

196
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,454
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT MANY

197
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,221
OF THOSE FORMER DISSIDENTS WHEN

198
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,589
THEY WERE FREE REMEMBERED.

199
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,391
THEY SAID IT WAS SOMETHING THAT

200
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:24,858
GAVE THEM HOPE.

201
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,794
I'M SORRY, BUT I HOLD OUT THAT

202
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,761
EXPECTATION.

203
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,964
I'M NOT EXPECTING A NEGOTIATION

204
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:30,931
WHERE KIM JONG UN SUDDENLY

205
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,799
BECOMES A JEFFERSONIAN DEMOCRAT.

206
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,300
I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT GOING TO

207
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,235
HAPPEN, BUT AT THE SAME TIME

208
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,503
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

209
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,237
THAT AND HAVING AN AMERICAN

210
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,740
PRESIDENT BASICALLY BECOME IN

211
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,710
SOME WAYS SORT OF PART OF THE

212
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,377
DICTATOR'S LIE ABOUT HIS

213
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,079
POPULARITY WITH HIS OWN PEOPLE.

214
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,382
>> Bret: IS THERE SOME OF THIS

215
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,550
THAT IS WHAT IF THREE SUMMITS ON

216
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,951
THE ROAD HE REALLY DOES HAPPEN?

217
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,354
WHAT IF THE PARADIGM HAS SHIFTED

218
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,021
WHAT IF THE PARADIGM HAS SHIFTE

219
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:54,355
SHIFTED?

220
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,055
WHAT IF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

221
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,957
LOOKING AT THIS AS A

222
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:57,958
BREAKTHROUGH ON THE RIGHT ONES

223
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,160
AND THE ONES THAT ARE VERY

224
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,928
SCARED OF THAT POTENTIAL ARE THE

225
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,163
WRONG ONES?

226
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:03,797
>> THAT'S POSSIBLE.

227
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,499
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE AT THIS

228
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:05,966
POINT.

229
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,702
BUT I DO THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO

230
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,371
BE A REALIST OR A SO-CALLED

231
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,172
REALIST TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A

232
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,007
PROBLEM FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE

233
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:14,375
UNITED STATES TO SAY THINGS THAT

234
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:14,775
AREN'T TRUE.

235
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,544
THE PRESIDENT CAME BACK AND

236
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,278
TWEETED THAT NORTH KOREA WAS NO

237
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:24,885
LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT.

238
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,586
>> Bret: EVERYONE CAN NOW FEEL

239
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,320
MUCH SAFER THAN THE DAY I TOOK

240
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,653
OFFICE.

241
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,321
THERE IS NO LONGER A NUCLEAR

242
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:27,955
THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA.

243
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,156
MEETING KIM JONG UN WAS AN

244
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,391
INTERESTING AND VERY POSITIVE

245
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,091
EXPERIENCE.

246
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,359
NORTH KOREA HAS GREAT POTENTIAL

247
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,794
FOR THE FUTURE.

248
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:34,962
BEFORE TAKING OFFICE, WE WERE

249
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,764
ASSUMING THAT WE WERE GOING TO

250
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:37,765
WAR WITH NORTH KOREA.

251
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,799
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID NORTH KOREA

252
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,433
WAS OUR BIGGEST AND MOST

253
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,169
DANGEROUS PROBLEM.

254
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:42,669
NO LONGER.

255
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,771
SLEEP WELL TONIGHT.

256
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,072
WE SAVE A FORTUNE BY NOT DOING

257
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,774
MORE GAMES AS LONG AS WE ARE

258
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:47,474
NEGOTIATING WITH GOOD FAITH,

259
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,210
WHICH BOTH SIDES ARE VERY

260
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,078
>> THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES ON

261
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,479
SEEING THE WORLD AS IT IS,

262
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,680
THAT'S THE WHOLE BASIS OF THE

263
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,014
FAUCET.

264
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,749
THAT IS NOT DESCRIBING THE WORLD

265
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,150
AS IT IS.

266
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,186
NORTH KOREA REMAINS A FIRST

267
00:06:59,186 --> 00:06:59,987
THREAT.

268
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:00,821
NORTH KOREA STILL HAS NUCLEAR

269
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:01,588
WEAPONS AND A TYRANT DICTATOR AS

270
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,357
ITS LEADER.

271
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,558
THEY PRESENT A THREAT TO THE

272
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,759
UNITED STATES.

273
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,527
THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THAT

274
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,227
AND FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE

275
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,662
UNITED STATES TO COME BACK,

276
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,165
HOWEVER PROUD HE IS OF WHAT HE'S

277
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:11,965
DONE AND SAY THAT NORTH KOREA IS

278
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,300
NO LONGER A NUCLEAR THREAT,

279
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,801
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

280
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,135
FOUR MONTHS AGO, GOING INTO

281
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,637
THIS, BEFORE THE SUMMIT WAS

282
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,405
ANNOUNCED, THE PETITION OF THE

283
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,239
ADMINISTRATION WAS WE WON'T EVEN

284
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,642
TALK TO THE NORTH KOREANS AND

285
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,576
LESS THEY TAKE CONCRETE

286
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,545
VERIFIABLE STEPS TOWARDS

287
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,145
DENUCLEARIZATION.

288
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,580
THEY JUST ABANDON THAT, WHICH IS

289
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,114
ITS OWN CONCESSION.

290
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,983
AND NOW FOUR MONTHS LATER WITH

291
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:30,717
THE ONLY INTERVENING EVENT BEING

292
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,788
THE SIGNING OF A DOCUMENT BY A

293
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,522
DICTATOR WHOSE FORBEARERS HAVE

294
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,324
LIED ABOUT THINGS FOR 30 YEARS,

295
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,626
THEY ARE NOW SAYING THERE'S NO

296
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,994
MORE NUCLEAR THREAT.

297
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:41,762
>> I THINK YOU ARE SEEING A LOT

298
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,496
OF FRUSTRATION THAT THINGS HAVE

299
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,198
GONE SO WELL.

300
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,599
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THAT MANY

301
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,266
EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP WAS

302
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,367
DOING WOULD NOT GO WELL FOR HIM

303
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,570
OR FOR THE UNITED STATES.

304
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,371
HIS BELLICOSE TWEETING

305
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,272
SUPPOSEDLY HAD US ON THE BRINK

306
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,207
OF NUCLEAR WAR.

307
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,775
WE ALL SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

308
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,109
SUMMIT.

309
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:55,609
WE ARE NOT NAIVE.

310
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,977
IT'S NOT LIKE THE NUCLEAR

311
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,778
WEAPONS METRO WEEKLY DISAPPEARED

312
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:58,946
BUT WE SAW THAT WE HAVE A VERY

313
00:07:58,946 --> 00:07:59,713
GOOD START AND IF IT DOESN'T

314
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,883
CONTINUE TO GO WELL WE WILL HAVE

315
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:03,750
TO RENEGOTIATE.

316
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,952
>> DO YOU THINK NORTH KOREA IS A

317
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,020
NUCLEAR THREAT STILL?

318
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,388
>> EVERYONE.

319
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,089
>> THE PRESIDENTS OF THE

320
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:09,456
OPPOSITE.

321
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,058
>> WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS THAT WE

322
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,192
VERY GOOD TALKS, WE HAVE A GOOD

323
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,027
FRAMEWORK, GOOD WEIGHT.

324
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,063
>> YOU DISAGREE WITH THE

325
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,131
PRESIDENT?

326
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,532
>> Bret: THERE IS SOMETHING

327
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,266
ABOUT TAKING HIM LITERALLY AND

328
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,535
TAKING HIM FIGURATIVELY IN THE

329
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,004
TWEETS AND WHAT THEY MEAN AND

330
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:24,972
READING TRUMP LANGUAGE.

331
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,807
THERE IS ALL THAT THAT YOU HAVE

332
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:27,774
TO FACTOR IN.

333
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:28,408
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

334
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,510
IT'S STILL IN NUCLEAR THREAT

335
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,843
TONIGHT.

336
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,179
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

337
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,148
>> WE CAN DECIDE THAT WE DON'T

338
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:36,482
WANT TO FOR OUR OWN REASONS TO

339
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,583
TAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WORDS

340
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:37,951
LITERALLY.

341
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,385
THAT IS NOT A LUXURY THAT THE

342
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,787
REST OF THE WORLD HAS AND I

343
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,256
GUARANTEE YOU IT'S NOT SOMETHING

344
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,957
THAT KIM JONG UN HAS AND IT

345
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,092
POKES MIKE POMPEO IN A BOX, WHEN

346
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,962
EYE IS THE VERY DIFFICULT TASK

347
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,966
OF -- WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS

348
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:53,700
ALREADY CLARIFIED THAT THERE IS

349
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,570
NO THREAT.

350
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,172
>> Bret: I HAVE TEN SECONDS.

351
00:08:58,172 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BUT
