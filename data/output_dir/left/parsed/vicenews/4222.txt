Karakas now they're marching and
protesting four out of the seven days of
the week every other day the economy's
in a pre polymer Venezuela right now
and people are hungry yes
this is happening all around our country
not only here in here in Caracas and
he's across generations and across
social income and sectors so it's a true
citizen revolution
so we've been marching for about an hour
right now and you can see everybody
going towards the public defender's
office the vibes have been really mellow
its families it's kids grandmothers
there's also the kind of core hard core
element here the valandros they've come
in dear to government vehicle behind us
they'll probably burn it down later we
are gonna go get our gear our helmets
our gas masks and flak jackets before we
go further because that's where things
are gonna start getting tougher as they
say what are these guys doing these are
like the safe wall between the National
Guard or the police and the
demonstrators they're building
barricades they building barricades just
to protect such civil society from tear
gas rubber bullets and whatever the
natural girls want to throw to them they
are like the protectors of the
demonstrators
we're in the thick of it now these kids
are making Molotov cocktails they're
smashing boulders making small rocks to
throw tear gas everywhere
there is no fear anymore this is a
citizen's revolution you can feel it on
the street people aren't afraid they're
ready to fight
the problem with the situation just
believe one way in and one way out so it
makes for Stampede like to it
so the barges have been
no we're on solar cycle
panic ensued
electively got travel
