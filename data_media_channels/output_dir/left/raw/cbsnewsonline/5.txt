THAT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CONDUCTING AN AGGRESSIVE

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INVESTIGATION AND WE WILL FIND

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THOSE RESPONSIBLE AND WE WILL

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BRING THEM TO JUSTICE.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HOPEFULLY VERY QUICKLY.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ANY ACTS OR THREATS OF POLITICAL

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VIOLENCE ARE ON ATTACK ON OUR

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRACY ITSELF.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NO NATION CAN SUCCEED THAT

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TOLERATES VIOLENCE OR THE THREAT

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF VIOLENCE AS A METHOD OF

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
POLITICAL INTIMIDATION, COERCION

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OR CONTROL.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ALL KNOW THAT.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SUCH CONDUCT MUST BE FIERCELY

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OPPOSED AND FIRMLY PROSECUTED.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WANT ALL SIDES TO COME

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TOGETHER IN PEACE AND HARMONY.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE CAN DO IT.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE CAN DO IT.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE CAN DO IT.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WILL HAPPEN.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MORE BROADLY, THERE IS MUCH WE

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN DO TO BRING OUR NATION

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TOGETHER.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE ENGAGED IN

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE POLITICAL ARENA MUST STOP

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TREATING POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BEING MORALLY DEFECTIVE.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE TO DO THAT.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE LANGUAGE OF MORAL

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CONDEMNATION AND DESTRUCTIVE

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ROUTINE, THESE ARE ARGUMENTS AND

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DISAGREEMENTS THAT HAVE TO STOP.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NO ONE SHOULD CARELESSLY COMPARE

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
POLITICAL OPPONENTS TO

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HISTORICAL VILLAINS WHICH IS

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DONE OFTEN, ITS DONE ALL THE

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOT TO STOP.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE SHOULD NOT MOB PEOPLE IN

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PUBLIC SPACES OR DESTROY PUBLIC

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PROPERTY.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE IS ONE WAY TO SETTLE OUR

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DISAGREEMENTS, IT IS CALLED

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEACEFULLY AT THE BALLOT BOX.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS WHAT WE WANT.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS WHAT WE WANT.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AS PART OF A LARGER NATIONAL

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EFFORT TO BRIDGE OUR DIVIDES AND

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, THE MEDIA

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALSO HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SET

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A CIVIL TONE AND TO STOP THE

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ENDLESS HOSTILITY AND CONSTANT

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NEGATIVE AND OFTEN TIMES FALSE

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ATTACKS AND STORIES.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE TO DO IT.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE TO DO IT.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HAVE TO STOP.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE JUST 13 DAYS AWAY FROM A

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS AN ELECTION OF MONUMENTAL

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JUST -- IF YOU LOOK AT IT,

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MONUMENTAL IMPORTANCE.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, MONUMENTAL

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IMPORTANCE?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE ARE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BETWEEN OUR TWO POLITICAL

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PARTIES THAT WE KNOW.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS A ESSENTIAL FOR DEMOCRACY

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TO DRAW A SHARP CONTRAST BETWEEN

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE TWO DIFFERENT PLATFORM PUT

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT NOW IN MANY STATES AND ON

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOVEMBER 6TH.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE NEED MORE NOT LESS DEBATE

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT POLICY ISSUES IN OUR

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT WE CANNOT DO IS LET OUR

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT MATTERS OF

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
POLICY TEAR US APART AS A

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN'T DO THAT.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE MUST ACCEPT THE VERDICTS OF

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ELECTIONS AND REMEMBER THAT

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICA'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THOSE ENDEAVORS

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE EMBARKED ON TOGETHER.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE HAD GREAT, GREAT

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ACHIEVEMENTS.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO TRUE.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO LETS PUT IT ALL

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LET'S PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LET'S GET ALONG.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GREAT COUNTRY.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WILL GET ALONG.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY AS

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TO ASK THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TO RE-ELECT A TRULY GREAT

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOVERNOR, SCOTT WALKER.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND TO SEND AN INCREDIBLE

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOMAN AND TALENT LEAH -- TO THE

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNITED STATES SENATE.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LEAH -- THOSE ARE TWO GREAT

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SCOTT AND LEAH ARE TRUE

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CHAMPIONS FOR THE STATE.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EARLY VOTING IS NOW UNDERWAY SO

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GET OUT AND VOTE.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE DECISION IN THIS ECOLLECTION

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IS SO CLEAR ALL OVER THE

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS ARE FOR LOWER TAXES,

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LESS REGULATIONS AND MORE

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ECONOMIC FREEDOM.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOR

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HIGHER TAXES, MORE REGULATION,

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND MORE TOP DOWN GOVERNMENT

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CONTROL.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND BY THE WAY, DO YOU SEE HOW

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NICE SOME ARE BEHAVING TONIGHT?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS LIKE -- HAVE YOU EVER

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SEEN THERE?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE ALL BEHAVING VERY WELL

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP IT

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAY, RIGHT?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WAY.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS WANT TO CREATE

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BETTER HEALTH CARE THROUGH MORE

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CHOICE, LOWER DRUG PRICES AND

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WILL SEE VERY SOON DRUG

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRICES WILL GO PLUNGING

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DOWNWARD.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WAIT, YOU WATCH.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS ALL IN MOTION.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE HAVE CREATED MUCH MORE

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COMPETITION.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRATS WANT SOCIALIST HEALTH

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CARE WHERE PRIVATE PLANS ARE

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOLISHED.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS WANT A STRONG SECURE

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BORDER --

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU KNEW IT A LONG TIME AGO

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DUH WHEN OUR COUNTRY IS

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ASSAULTED BY THOUSANDS AND

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MARCHING AND

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY OPENLY SAY WE ARE GOING TO

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GO INTO THE COUNTRY, WE CAN'T DO

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS UNFAIR TO YOU BUT IT'S ALSO

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNFAIR TO THOUSANDS AND

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GONE THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SOME ARE WAITING IN LINE TEN

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YEARS.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT AND THEY

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T GET IN BUT OTHER PEOPLE

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JUST MARCH RIGHT IN.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WATCH.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WON'T HAPPEN.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE CAN'T LET IT.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THOSE WHO VOI LATE OUR LAWS

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND CROSS OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL BE SENT BACK HOME QUICKLY.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE TELL THEM THAT CAUSE

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HAVE A LONG HIKE BUT THEY

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN'T COME -- THEY CANNOT COME

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO COME IN.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE A COUNTRY AND WE HAVE THE

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, OKAY?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THE

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RULE OF LAW IS ESSENTIAL TO

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND WE KNOW

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IS

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ESSENTIAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY,

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PROTECTION OF AMERICAN JOBS,

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WAGES AND PUBLIC BENEFITS.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU KNOW THAT.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I SAID I WAS GOING BRING THE

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JOBS BACK.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE FACTORIES COMING BACK.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE PLANTS COMING BACK.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE COMPANIES COMING BACK.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE JOBS ARE COMING BACK

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID IT.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT -- I COULD

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DO IT

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS QUICKLY.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRATS OPPOSE ANY EFFORT TO

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SECURE OUR BORDER.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT WE

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE DOING WITH OUR BORDER OVER

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AS YOU KNOW WE STARTED THE

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WALL $1.6 BILLION.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ANOTHER $1.6 BILLION AND WE HAVE

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ANOTHER BUT WE WANT TO BUILD IT

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VERY QUICKLY AT ONE TIME AND WE

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL GET IT DONE.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WILL SEE A VERY SECURE

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BORDER, YOU JUST WATCH.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VERY SECURE.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE MILITARY IS READY.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE ALL SET.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE ALL SET.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE ALREADY AND THERE IS

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOBODY LIKE THEM.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN CATCH AND

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RELEASE.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S -- YOU CATCH A PERSON

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COMING ACROSS A BORDER

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ILLEGALLY.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MY NAME IS SO AND SO.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WELL DO A FAVOR, WRITE IT DOWN.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL YOU SHOW UP IN THREE OR

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOUR YEARS FOR A COURT CASE?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YES I WILL SHOW UP AND WE NEVER

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SEE THEM AGAIN.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT SANCTUARY

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CITIES THAT REFUSE TO COOPERATE

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RELEASE KNOWN GONG MEMBERS,

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PREDATORS, CRIMINAL ALIENS INTO

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OUR COMMUNITIES.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WISCONSIN.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FAST.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MS 13, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF MS 13.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE OUT.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT FAST

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE OF ICE AND OTHER LAW

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ENFORCEMENT -- ICE.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY COME IN AND OTHER LAW

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ENFORCEMENT.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE DEMOCRATS, EVEN OPPOSE

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PENALTY FOR CRIMINALS AND DRUG

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEALERS WHO REPEATEDLY BREAK

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INTO OUR COUNTRY AND HURT AND

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SERIOUSLY INJURY AND EVEN WORSE,

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OUR PEOPLE.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE NOT ALLOWING IT ANYMORE

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THEY UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNDERSTAND IT.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS IT.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JUDGES SHOULD INTERPRET THE

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE JUDGES SHOULD

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BE ABLE TO REUNITED STATES THE

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CONSTITUTION WHICH THEY ARE

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DOING ALL THE TIME.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BORDER.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY END UP WRITING RULES AND

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REGULATIONS THAT ARE -- WORSE

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BUT

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ULTIMATELY, WE ARE GOING TO GET

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UP TO THE SUPREME COURT AND

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HOPEFULLY THAT GREAT COURT WILL

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ISSUES IN THIS ELECTION.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THESE ARE ALSO THE REASONS

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHY ITS SO IMPORTANT FOR EACH OF

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A YOU -- EACH ONE, TO GET OUT

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND VOTE.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GET OUT AND VOTE.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRAT, DON'T BOTHER.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE --

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS HERE, DON'T WE?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO BETWEEN SCOTT AND LEAH,

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHOSE IN FAVOR OF THOSE TWO

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GREAT PEOPLE?

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YES?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THOUGHT SO.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OUTSIDE.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, BY

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WAY.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICA IS BOOMING.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICA IS THRIVING.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND AMERICA IS WINNING BECAUSE

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FIRST.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS BEEN A LONG TIME.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS BEEN A LONG TIME.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER 50

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YEARS.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
5-0 YEARS.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
50.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MANUFACTURING CONFIDENCE HAS

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH IN THE

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK ITS NOW 38 YEARS OLD

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS FALL.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS A LONG TIME.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COULD BE LONGER BUT I THINK IT

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOULD PROBABLY ALSO BE IN THE

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HISTORY CONFIDENCE ALL TIME

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HIGH.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING NOW THAN

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AT ANY POINT IN THE HISTORY OF

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE UNITED STATES.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK OF THAT.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IS THAT WE HAVE ELIMINATED A

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REGULATIONS.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PASSED A MASSIVE TAX CUT FOR

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WORKING FAMILIES.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE WILL SOON FOLLOW IT UP

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH ANOTHER 10% TAX CUT FOR THE

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MIDDLE CLASS.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S ALL FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE TAX CUT WE

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND FOR

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUSINESS.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT.

383

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LOT OF GOVERNORS, SOME ARE GOOD,

SOME AREN'T SO HOT, SOME ARE

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REALLY NOT SO GOOD.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU I HAVE TO

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAY THIS TO WISCONSIN, HE RAN

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AGAINST ME AND THE PRIMARY.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE WAS TOUGH.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE COULD BE NASTY.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOW.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT HE WAS TOUGH.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE WAS SMART.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'VE GOT -- GOTTEN TO KNOW HIM

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WELL.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE DID SOMETHING I DIDN'T THINK

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOULD BE HAPPENING IN THIS

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I GOT HIM SET UP WITH AN

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INCREDIBLE COMPANY CALLED FOX

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CON.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WORLD, THEY MAKE MUCH OF THE

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
APPLE PRODUCT AND YOU KNOW I'VE

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME, IT

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WON'T BE COMPLETE UNTIL WE GET

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
APPLE AND APPLE BY THE WAY IS

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY BRINGING BACK $230

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BILLION FROM OFFSHORE ONLY

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE OF OUR TAX CUT.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THEY ARE GOING TO GO WILD.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE BUILDING A GREAT

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAMPUS.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE BUILDING PLACES ALL

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER -- 350 BILLION.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS 350 MILLION,

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT SOUNDED GOOD.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD PLANTS

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR 30 -- THEY ARE DOING $350

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BILLION.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT FOX CON DOES MUCH OF THE

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WORK IN CHINA AND OTHER PLACES

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR APPLE.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THEY CAME TO WISCONSIN WITH

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE MOST INCREDIBLE PLAN -- I

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T KNOW HAS ANYBODY SEEN THIS

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PLACE?

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'VE HAVE SEEN.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE TOURED AND IT HAD A RIBBON

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CUTTING A FEW MONTHS AGO.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I HANDED IT OVER THE SCOTT AND I

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAID LOTS OF LUCK.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAS JUST THE VERY

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BEGINNING.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
99% OF THE PEOPLE COULD NEVER

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE -- DONE THAT JOB.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT ONLY DO THE JOB, DO IT SO

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WELL.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WAS ALMOST 15,000 JOBS AND

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT, THERE IS NO

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PLANT LIKE IT ANYWHERE IN THE

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNITED STATES.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THINGS I'VE HAVE SEEN.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THINGS.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I WILL NEVER FORGET I'M GOING

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AROUND WITH SCOTT AND PAUL, RYE

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SCOMBRAN EVERYBODY AND -- JUST

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INCREDIBLE.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE HERE.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE GOING AROUND AT THE

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OPENING AND THEY NEEDED ROBOTS

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO THEY SAID -- RATHER THAN

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING AND BUYING THEM, FROM A

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GERMAN MANUFACTURE, WE WILL MAKE

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEM HERE.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THIS IS COMPLEX STUFF JUST

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO YOU UNDERSTAND.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THE WORLD.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND YOU COME BACK THREE MONTHS

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LATER, THEY HAVE A WHOLE ROBOT

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FACTORY MADE.

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS MOST INCREDIBLE THING.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE GREAT

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PLANTS CERTAINLY IN THIS COUNTRY

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CLOSE.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THE WORLD ITS RIGHT AT THE

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TOP.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WAS DONE BECAUSE OF SCOTT

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WALKER.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WELL I JUST WANTED TO YOU TO

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
KNOW -- FEW PEOPLE COULD HAVE

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DONE IT.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A LOT OF JOBS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AT IT, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKE IT.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EARLIER THIS MONTH I ANNOUNCED

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WE ARE REPLACING THE --

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE NAFTA DEAL

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH AN INCREDIBLE BRAND NEW

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SEE THINGS FROM NAFTA -- WE

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STILL

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE SCARRED ALL OVER OUR

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MILLIONS OF JOBS WERE LOST.

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BIG PORTIONS OF OUR AUTO

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INDUSTRY WAS LOST TO MEXICO AND

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OTHER PLACES.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER.

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WAS A BAD DEAL FROM DAY ONE.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT SHOULD BEEN TERMINATED ON DAY

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TWO.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND 25 YEARS LATER I GOT IT

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TERMINATED, OKAY.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
USMCA, IT WORKS.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOW I SAY IT LIKE ROUTINELY.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOW ITS VERY ROUTINE.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS A GIANT VICTORY FOR

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WISCONSIN FARMERS, MANUFACTURERS

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND AIR REPRODUCERS.

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I HAVE TO SAY THIS CAUSE WE HAVE

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A LOT OF GREAT FARMERS IN THIS

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY BUT I GIVE WISCONSIN A

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LOT OF CREDIT FOR IT CAUSE I

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAME UP HERE ONCE -- AND IT WAS

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ROUGH.

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I WAS WITH RON JOHNSON, A GREAT

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PERSON A GREAT SENATOR WHO LOVES

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU.

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND PAUL -- AND I WAS WITH SCOTT

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND -- I'M JUST GOING AROUND AND

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FARMERS CAME UP TO ME.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIR, SIR, COULD YOU HELP ME?

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FARMING.

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I KNOW ABOUT BUSINESS AND THESE

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GREAT PEOPLE CAME UP, SIR, SIR,

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CANADA JUST -- PUT A SURCHARGE

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ON OUR DAIRY AND THEY DID THIS

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THEY DID THAT AND I SAID

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEN I GO SEE ANOTHER GROUP,

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIR -- THEY ARE JUST PUT A VERY

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OWNERS TAX ON A VERY SPECIFIC

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TYPE OF SPECIALTY MILK.

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT THE DO I KNOW ABOUT

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SPECIALTY MILK?

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S FUNNY.

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WAS A VERY SMALL PART OF THE

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MARKET BUT IT WAS THE WRONG

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THING TO DO.

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND IT REALLY ANGERED.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ON THE BIG PART OF THE MARKET IN

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DAIRY YOU WERE PAYING 275%

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TARIFFS AND NOBODY KNEW THAT.

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS LITTLE TINY PART OF

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SPECIALTY MARKET, IT GOT YOU.

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS LITTLE -- WHICH WAS A

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FRACTION OF -- THE BIG MARKET

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT YOU ACCEPTED AND YOU LIVED

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH IT.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BASICALLY IT WAS A BARRIER TO

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CANADA.

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WAS A BARRIER AND A GREAT

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE CANADA BUT THIS WAS A

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BARRIER.

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS LITTLE THING GOT YOUR GOAT

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I GET UP HERE -- I GOT HIT

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BY EVERY FARMER IN WISCONSIN

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER THIS.

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WAS JUST A STEP TOO FAR.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY JUST WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR.

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SINCE THAT TIME I NEVER FORGOT

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT.

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU ARE REALLY RESPONSIBLE TO A

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LARGE EXTENT FOR THE

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
USMCA.

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOW AS YOU KNOW THE CANADIAN

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MARKET WHICH WAS NOT OPEN IS NOW

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OPEN.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GO DO WELL.

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND IT'S A GREAT AGREEMENT AND

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE OUR

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUSINESSES ANYMORE.

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MOVE DOWN AND BUILD PLANTS AND

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE USMCA

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT, IT

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STARTED HERE BECAUSE OF A

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SPECIALTY DAIRY LITTLE TINY

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DAIRY PRODUCT.

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OKAY.

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE I SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY.

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND YOUR POLITICAL LEADERS AND

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS ALL OF THEM -- THEY

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PUSHED ME HARD.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY SAY DON'T FORGET THOSE

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FARMERS.

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DIDN'T.

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I CAME BACK NUMEROUS TIMES AND

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAW THE FARMERS BUT WE HAVE A

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME AGREEMENT.

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT WILL BE APPROVED BY CONGRESS

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M SURE VERY QUICKLY.

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT A PERIOD

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF TIME AND THEN YOU HAVE TO

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WAIT AGAIN BUT ITS RIGHT ON

604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TRACK DOING WELL.

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVEN I MUST SAY -- THIS IS VERY

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
POSITIVE.

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVEN DEMOCRATS LIKE THIS DEAL.

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE DEMOCRATS LIKE THE DEAL.

609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

610
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT MAY BE BIPARTISAN.

611
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

612
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

613
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING

614
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT TODAY.

615
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE CAN DO A LOT OF THAT.

616
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK WE WILL BE DO BIPARTISAN

617
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

618
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

619
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE

620
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

YOU HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT.

623
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

667
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THEN I SAW THE WAY THEY MADE

668
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HIM SUFFER.

669
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

675
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE'S A GREAT PERSON.

676
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAS A TOUGH TREATMENT.

677
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO GET RID

678
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF THAT KIND OF TREATMENT.

679
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

690
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT'S THE

691
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MOST IMPORTANT DECISION A

692
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT CAN MAKE.

693
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

695
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OKAY.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WILL CHANGE BECAUSE -- THAT'S

698
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WAY IT IS.

699
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT

700
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DECISION AND THEY ARE TWO GREAT

701
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE AND -- I'M VERY HONORED.

702
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MANY PRESIDENTS DON'T GET A

703
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CHANCE TO PUT A SUPREME COURT

704
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PROMISE YOU MADE FOR US.

1158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERY WHERE I GO IN THIS GREAT

1159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STATE, AND I LOOKED OUT WHEN I

1160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SPOKE TO ALL OF YOU BEFORE AND

1161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS OVERWHELMING BECAUSE I

1162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE PUT ON 92,000 MILES ON MY

1163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAR AND I SEE FACES FROM EVERY

1164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTY I VISITED.

1165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL 72 COUNTIES AND YOU ALL

1166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

OVER AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO

1168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SEND TAMMY BALDWIN BACK TO THE

1169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRIVATE SECTOR THAT SHE DOESN'T

1170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
KNOW EXISTS.

1171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYTHING THIS PRESIDENT

1172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO, HE'S

1173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DONE.

1174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE NEED TO SEND HIM SOMEONE IN

1175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WASHINGTON SO THAT SENATOR RON

1176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JOHNSON'S BOAT ISN'T CANCELLED

1177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I NEED YOUR HELP TO DO THAT.

1178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TAXING TAMMY DOESN'T HAVE

1179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOUR BEST INTEREST IN MIND.

1180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TAXING TAMMY HAS VOTED TO

1181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INCREASE YOUR TAXES 413 TIMES.

1182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR TALK

1183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT $2,500.

1184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK IT WAS $2,508.

1185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TAXING TAMMY DIDN'T THINK YOU

1186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DESERVED THAT $2,500.

1187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK YOU DO.

1188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND OF COURSE THE ISSUE

1189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

1190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE

1191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WALKER TALKED ABOUT, TAMMY

1193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BALDWIN IS SAYING THAT SAME LIE

1194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

1195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE SUPPORT TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE

1196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.

1197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I WILL SAY

1198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT AGAIN.

1199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I WILL FALL IN FRONT OF A TRUCK

1200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BEFORE I LET PEOPLE GO WITHOUT

1201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COVERAGE FOR PREEXISTING

1202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CONDITIONS.

1203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DO, WE HAVE TO HAVE HER DOWN

1250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE NEED THE VOTES AND WE NEED

1252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LEAH.

1253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE DEMOCRAT HEALTH CARE PLAN

1254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOULD OH O SPLIT RATE HEALTH

1255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CARE -- OBLITERATE HEALTH CARE.

1256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE PEOPLE THAT REALLY DEPEND

1257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ON IT.

1258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT

1259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS

1260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO HAVE EARNED IT.

1261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY PAID FOR IT FOR A LONG

1262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME.

1263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY PAID FOR IT.

1264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS

1265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PROTECT AS LEAH SAID --

1266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING

1267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CONDITIONS.

1268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
100%.

1269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
100%.

1270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.

1271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE GOTTEN RID OF A LOT OF

1272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF OBAMA

1273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CARE.

1274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAD IT BEATEN BUT WE GOT NO

1275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRAT VOTES.

1276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT ONE.

1277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND -- WE HAD IT REPEALED AND

1278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPLACED BUT E-SEPTEMBERALLY WE

1279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE DISMANTLED IT.

1280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE GOT RID OF -- SO MUCH AND SO

1281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MANY BAD ELEMENTS OF IT.

1282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO SIZE --

1283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IF YOU NOTICE YOUR PREMIUMS ARE

1284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING UP BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE

1285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DONE.

1286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING UP VERY LITTLE BY

1287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COMPARISON.

1288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REMEMBER LAST YEAR I CAME HERE

1289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OR THE YEAR BEFORE I CAME HERE

1290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASES

1291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF 115%, 190%, 216% IN SOME

1292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STATES AND -- WE GOT RID OF A

1293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THING CALLED THE INDIVIDUAL

1294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MANDATE WHERE -- YOU HAD THE

1295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRIVILEGE OF PAYING A FORTUNE IN

1296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ORDER TO NOT PAY A FORTUNE IN

1297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BAD HEALTH CARE.

1298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

1299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM THEIR STANDPOINT GONE.

1300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS GONE.

1301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAVED TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF

1302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE.

1303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A LOT OF MONEY.

1304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAYFULLO ADD LOT OF SMALL

1305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUSINESS OWNERS A LOT OF MONEY.

1306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND NOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE

1307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE COME UP WITH GREAT PLANS.

1308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF CO-OP PLANS

1309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND OTHER PLANS AND PEOPLE ARE

1310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING TO THEM BY THE MILLIONS.

1311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS BEEN AN HONOR WE FELT HAVE

1312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DONE A REAL JOB AND HEALTH CARE

1313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IS GOING TO BE OUR MAJOR FOCUS.

1314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ONE OF OUR MAJOR FOCUSES.

1315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING VERY

1316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
úSPE.

1317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GETTING RID OF THAT INDIVIDUAL

1318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MANDATE WAS SO IMPORTANT.

1319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SCOTT WOULD CALL ME ALL THE

1320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TIME, HOW DO YOU GET RID OF THE

1321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE?

1322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GUESS WHAT?

1323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE PUT IT INTO OUR TAX CUT PLAN.

1324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE?

1325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT

1326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MAJORITIES.

1327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DON'T HAVE LIKE -- ITS THIS.

1328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ALWAYS SAY -- IF A SENATOR

1329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CATCHES A COLD, WE DON'T HAVE A

1330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MAJORITY.

1331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE TO WAIT.

1332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE NEED MORE SENATORS.

1333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE NEED MORE CONGRESS MEN AND

1334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOMEN AND IT WILL HAPPEN.

1335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS BLUE WAVE,

1336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PAUL?

1337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE BLUE

1338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WAVE.

1339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS NOT DOING SO WELL.

1340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I BETTER BE A LITTLE CAREFUL

1341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- IN TWO WEEKS

1342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IF WE DON'T DO QUITE AS WELL AS

1343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE MAYBE THINKING WE ARE

1344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING TO DO, I WILL BE ALL OVER

1345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TELEVISION WITH THESE EXACT

1346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REMARKS.

1347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WILL BE DOING A NUMBER BUT

1348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S OKAY.

1349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOK, EARLY VOTING LOOKS

1350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD FOR THE

1351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS.

1352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EXTRAORDINARILY.

1353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO KNOWS.

1354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER -- IT ONLY

1355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MATTERS ON NOVEMBER 6TH WHEN

1356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THOSE VOTES ARE TALLIED UP AND

1357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTED.

1358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I LIKE THAT PERSON.

1367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO IS THAT PERSON?

1368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THANK YOU GOOD LOOKING GUY.

1369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NICE LOOKING MAN.

1370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT WE WANT STRENGTH.

1371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WANT A STRONG MILITARY.

1372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR

1373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VETERANS.

1374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WANT TO GET OUR VETERANS --

1375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DID SOMETHING FOR OUR

1376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VETERANS NOBODY THOUGHT WAS

1377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
POSSIBLE.

1378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE GOT VETERANS CHOICE WHERE

1379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE

1380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF -- IF THEY ARE NOT BEING

1381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TAKEN CARE OF THEY GO OUT TO A

1382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRIVATE DOCTOR.

1383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VETERANS CHOICE TOOK 44 YEARS

1384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND RYAN AND ALL OF THESE

1385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE THAT WE JUST

1386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INTRODUCED HELPED.

1387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYONE OF THEM.

1388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND PAUL, THANK YOU.

1389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WORKED HARD ON THAT ONE.

1390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAS NOT AN EASY ONE.

1391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THEN YOU HAD VETERANS

1392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ACCOUNTABILITY, PAUL, RIGHT?

1393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WAS 43 YEARS.

1394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW IF THEY

1395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T TREAT OUR VETERANS RIGHT,

1396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WERE -- REALLY PROTECTED.

1397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY COULD DO ANYTHING.

1398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY COULD STEAL.

1399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY COULD ROB.

1400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WITH OUR

1401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
VETERANS IN THEIR PRIME.

1402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT THEY WERE NASTY.

1403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WERE NASTY.

1404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU COULDN'T TO ANYTHING.

1405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOW WE CAN FIRE THEM SO FAST

1406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN.

1407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE DEMOCRATS ALSO WANT TO RAISE

1408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MEDICARE TO FUND BENEFITS FROM

1409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT

1410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO FUND THEM FOR

1411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SO THE

1412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COME IN.

1413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND HOW ABOUT THE GOVERNOR

1414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN SCOTT?

1415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE GOVERNOR WHO IS TRYING TO

1416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECOME THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE

1417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

1418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE WANTS OPEN BORDERS.

1419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK OF THIS, JUST THINK OF

1420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS, HE WANTS OPEN BORDERS.

1421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERYBODY CAN COME TO CALIFORNIA

1422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU FREE

1423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HEALTH CARE, FREE EDUCATION,

1424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DRIVERS LICENSES.

1425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT JOKINGLY,

1426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PROBABLY A ROLLS ROYCE AND ONE

1427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF THESE PEOPLE SAID HE SAID HE

1428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IS GOING TO GIVE THEM A ROLLS

1429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ROYCE AND HE DID NOT SAY THAT.

1430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU CAN'T JOKE WITH THESE

1431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE.

1432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU CAN'T BE EVEN A LITTLE

1433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SARCASM.

1434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID THEY WANT TO SUPPLY A

1435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ROLLS ROYCE -- THEY ACTUALLY

1436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAID ONE OF THEM -- JUST ONE,

1437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO SUPPLY A ROLLS

1438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ROYCE.

1439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY SAID THE GOVERNOR OF

1440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CALIFORNIA NEVER SAID THAT.

1441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE BUT MAYBE

1442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE START TAKING A JOKE AND

1443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MAYBE WE WILL BE A LOT BETTER

1444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OFF WHEN THEY DO.

1445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AS WE SPEAK THE DEMOCRAT PARTY

1446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IS OPENLY ENCOURAGING CARA VAN

1447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AFTER CARA VAN OF ILLEGAL ALIENS

1448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TO VIOLATE OUR LAWS AND BREAK

1449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INTO OUR COUNTRY.

1450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, FOLKS, YOU

1451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

1452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE CRISIS ON THE BORDER -- AND

1454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS A CRISIS.

1455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS CRAZY.

1456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS CRAZY.

1457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT NOW IS THE SOLE RESULT OF

1458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRAT LAWS AND ACTIVISTS

1459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRAT JUDGES THAT DO WHATEVER

1460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT AND THAT PREVENT US

1461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM RETURNING ILLEGAL ALIENS

1462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BACK HOME TO CENTRAL AMERICA AND

1463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

1464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEMOCRATS EVEN SUPPORT SANCTUARY

1465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CITIES THAT RELEASE VIOLENT GANG

1466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MEMBERS AND MS 13 -- YOU SEE THE

1467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MS 13 PREDATORS.

1468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I

1469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
USE THAT NAME.

1470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE PREDATORS.

1471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ONLY IN WISCONSIN, RIGHT ALL THE

1472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SCREAMING.

1473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SCREAMING.

1474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I WON'T SAY WHAT YOU SCREAMED.

1475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RELEASE THEM INTO U.S.

1476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COMMUNITIES, RIGHT?

1477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DON'T WANT THAT.

1478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNLESS YOU LIKE TO HAVE THEM UP

1479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IN WISCONSIN.

1480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE MS 13?

1481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU SURE?

1482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IF YOU SAID YES WE COULD SEND

1483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEM YOUR WAY.

1484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PAUL, I DON'T THINK WE WANT MS

1485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
13.

1486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

1487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN.

1488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ACTUALLY I THINK MS 13 WOULD BE

1489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IN BIG TROUBLE.

1490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUE.

1491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DO.

1492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY

1493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR

1494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT

1495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CRIMINAL ALIENS.

1496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL

1497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALWAYS STAND PROUDLY WITH THE

1498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HEROS OF ICE AND BORDER PATROL

1499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

1500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND YOU THINK THEY HAVE AN EASY

1501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JOB?

1502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON'T HAVE AN EASY JOB.

1503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE GREAT PATRIOTS.

1504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE -- YOU ARE

1505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT, THEY ARE HEROS.

1506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE PEOPLE -- YOU DON'T

1507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WANT THEIR JOB.

1508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY GO INTO NESTS.

1509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY CALL THEM NESTS OF GANGS

1510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKE MS 13, EQUAL.

1511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY GO INTO THESE NESTS LIKE

1512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS A DAY AT THE OFFICE.

1513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

1514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

1515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

1516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU -- I THINK THAT ONE DOES

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK HE DOES WANT TO DO IT

1519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ACTUALLY.

1520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ITS TOUGH STUFF.

1521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

WE ACTUALLY ARE.

1529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT OF THIS

1530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS .

THEY PUT THEM IN WAGONS AND GET

1547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

1548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY BRING THEM BACK HOME OR

1549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WORSE.

1550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THESE TOWNS ARE BEING

1551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING.

1553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS LIKE WATCHING WORLD WAR II

1554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE OCCUPATIONS -- THEY GET

1559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEM, THEY TAKE THEM OUT AND THE

1560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR WINDOWS

1561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CLAPPING AND SCREAMING AND THEY

1562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE HAPPY.

1563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS IS ICE AND THE DEMOCRATS

1564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WANT TO TERMINATE ICE.

1565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

STAMPS.

1602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE PREVIOUS

1603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADMINISTRATION SAID YOU CAPTAIN

1604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

FOR OUR COUNTRY.

1613
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT REMEMBER THEY SAID YOU NEED

1614
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A MAGIC WAND.

1615
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A MAGIC WAND?

1616
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I GUESS WE HAVE A MAGIC WAND,

1617
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1618
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

HERE IN WISCONSIN MANUFACTURING

1621
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JOBS ARE GROWING AT THE FASTEST

1622
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PACE IN MORE THAN 23 YEARS.

1623
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC

1624
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICAN POVERTY HAS REACHED AN

1625
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL TIME LOW.

1626
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN,

1627
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HISPANIC-AMERICAN,

1628
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ASIAN-AMERICAN EMPLOYMENT HAVE

1629
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL REACHED THEIR LOWEST RATES

1630
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVER RECORDED.

1631
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S A TOUGH SOUND BITE.

1632
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ISN'T THAT A TOUGH SOUND BITE

1633
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR THE OPPONENT?

1634
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT?

1635
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, KANYE

1636
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WEST LIKES ME.

1637
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHICH IS GOOD.

1638
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
INTERESTING GUY.

1639
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BIG JIM BROWN, RIGHT?

1640
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE THE OPPOSITES.

1641
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JIM BROWN SITTING THERE -- HE

1642
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOKS LIKE HE COULD PLAY

1643
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TOMORROW.

1644
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BIG JIM

1645
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT JUST 

1646
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FELL TO 3.6%, WHICH IS AS YOU 

1647
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT, THAT'S 

1648
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HIGH WORST STATISTIC. 

1649
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY THE LOWEST 

1650
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RATE IN 65 YEARS. 

1651
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S NOT HISTORIC. 

1652
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'VE BEEN WAITING SIX YEARS TO 

1653
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GET RID OF THAT STATISTIC, AND 

1654
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT, 

1655
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT IT'S HAPPENING SOON. 

1656
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE ALSO TAKING THE TOUGHEST 

1657
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVER ACTION TO CRACKDOWN ON 

1658
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CHINA'S ABUSIVE TRADE 

1659
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRACTICES. 

1660
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL, AND I 

1661
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAID, YOU'RE NOT READY YET. 

1662
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUE. 

1663
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO MAKE A TEAL, AND 

1664
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT XI IS A GREAT PERSON, 

1665
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO 

1666
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMETHING SOON OR SOME DAY. 

1667
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT YOU KNOW, $500 BILLION HAS 

1668
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY 

1669
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR YEARS, EVERY YEAR. 

1670
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
$500BILLION. 

1671
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ON TRADE, WE LOST $807 BILLION. 

1672
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK OF IT. 

1673
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO MADE THESE DEALS? 

1674
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO MADE THESE DEALS? 

1675
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE'RE THE ONE WITH ALL THE 

1676
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
POWER, BECAUSE WE'RE THE PIGGY 

1677
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BANK THAT ALL OF THESE 

1678
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRIES WANT TO COME IN AND 

1679
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ROB. 

1680
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO WE HAVE ALL THE POWER. 

1681
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT WE DID CANADA, AND MEXICO. 

1682
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DID SOUTH KOREA. 

1683
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THEM NOW. 

1684
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ALL WANT TO MAKE A DEAL 

1685
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF THOSE 

1686
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TARIFFS. 

1687
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON'T WANT THOSE TARIFFS. 

1688
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY'LL SIGN ANYTHING, PLEASE. 

1689
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T DO THAT TO ME, PRESIDENT 

1690
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUMP, WE DON'T WANT TARIFFS. 

1691
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE DON'T WANT TARIFFS, PLEASE! 

1692
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR 

1694
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE. 

1695
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU KNOW, WE HAD THESE 

1696
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GLOBALISTS, THEY DIDN'T CARE SO 

1697
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MUCH ABOUT US. 

1698
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE 

1699
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GLOBE. 

1700
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE 

1701
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

1702
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE'LL HELP OTHER COUNTRIES. 

1703
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE GOING TO HELP OTHER 

1704
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRIES. 

1705
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE WEALTHY, 

1706
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WEALTHY COUNTRIES WITH WE TAKE 

1707
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CARE OF THEIR MILITARY, AND 

1708
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE NOT REIMBURSED, OR WE'RE  

1709
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
REIMBURSED FOR A TINY FRACTION. 

1710
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN'T HAVE THAT. 

1711
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE ARE WEALTHY COUNTRIES. 

1712
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'VE ALREADY GONE TO SOME OF 

1713
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1714
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1715
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1716
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WHO CARES?

THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM. 

1718
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAY MR. PRIME MINISTER. 

1719
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAY MR. PRESIDENT. 

1720
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1723
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PAYING FOR THIS PROTECTION. 

1724
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOT TO START PAYING. 

1725
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND PRIME MINISTER ABE, PRIME 

1726
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MINISTER OF JAPAN, GREAT GUY. 

1727
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FANTASTIC GUY, ACTUALLY. 

1728
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JUST WON A BIG ELECTION. 

1729
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT I SAID TO TO HIM. 

1730
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JAPAN'S AN IMMENSELY WEALTHY 

1731
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NATION. 

1732
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY SEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS 

1733
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF CARS TO THE UNITED STATES, 

1734
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THEY ALSO BUILD THEM IN THE 

1735
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
UNITED STATES, I LIKE THEM 

1736
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BETTER, BY THE WAY. 

1737
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK THEY'RE MUCH NICER. 

1738
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT I SAID TO PRIME MINISTER 

1739
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ABE, I SAID LOOK, WE'RE TAKING 

1740
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CARE OF YOUR MILITARY. 

1741
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HELPED YOU A LOT WITH NORTH 

1742
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
KOREA. 

1743
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY'RE NOT SENDING MISSILES 

1744
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OVER JAPAN. 

1745
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DID THAT. 

1746
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, WOULDN'T 

1747
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU SAY? 

1748
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 

1749
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S A GOOD THING. 

1750
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT YOU'RE ONLY PAYING FOR A 

1751
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PERCENTAGE OF YOUR MILITARY. 

1752
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE DOING THE REST. 

1753
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY HELP US 

1754
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OUT. 

1755
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S NOT FAIR. 

1756
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE 

1757
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. 

1758
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID HAS ANYONE EVER ASKED 

1759
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU TO DO THIS BEFORE? 

1760
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE GOES NO. 

1761
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S TRUE! 

1762
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF 

1763
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DOLLARS. 

1764
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SOUTH KOREA, THE SAME THING. 

1765
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WONDERFUL PEOPLE. 

1766
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT MOON. 

1767
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE BUY MISSILE SYSTEMS. 

1768
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HOW MUCH IS THAT SYSTEM? 

1769
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIR, THAT SYSTEM IS $1 BILLION. 

1770
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOOD. 

1771
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GENERAL TOLD ME THAT. 

1772
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID GENERAL, WHOSE PAYING 

1773
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR IT? 

1774
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIR, I DON'T KNOW. 

1775
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID FIND OUT WHO'S PAYING. 

1776
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK I KNEW THE ANSWER. 

1777
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
úCOM 

1778
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE SYSTEM IS -- THING OF IT, 

1779
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT 1 MILLION, 1 BILLION. 

1780
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE SYSTEM IS $1 BILLION, AND 

1781
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIR, THE UNITED STATES OF 

1782
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICA IS PAYING FOR IT. 

1783
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID WHY ARE WE PAYING? 

1784
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, YOU HAVE 

1785
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MISSILES BEING SHOT FROM NORTH 

1786
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
KOREA. 

1787
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN NOW, 

1788
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOLKS, BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT 

1789
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN. 

1790
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CHAIRMAN KIM. 

1791
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MISSILES GO FROM NORTH KOREA TO 

1792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SOUTH KOREA. 

1793
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE A MISSILE SYSTEM, IT 

1794
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
COSTS $1 BILLION. 

1795
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE SHOOT THE MISSILES DOWN. 

1796
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S GREAT. 

1797
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY MAKE YOUR SAMSUNG, YOUR 

1798
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LG, THEY'RE MAKING A FORTUNE 

1799
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE OF US. 

1800
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS OVER 

1801
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE THAT THEY DON'T PAY FOR. 

1802
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FIGURE THAT ONE. 

1803
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO THEY'RE MAKING THE MISSILES, 

1804
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAY, SO GENERAL LET ME ASK 

1805
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU A QUESTION, WHY IS IT THAT 

1806
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON'T PAY? 

1807
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE SIR, THEY ARE AN ALLY 

1808
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OF THE UNITED STATES OF 

1809
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AMERICA. 

1810
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I SAY GENERAL, I LIKE THEM 

1811
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TOO, BUT THEY GOT TO PAY. 

1812
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY GOT TO PAY. 

1813
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY GOT TO PAY. 

1814
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY GOT TO PAY! 

1815
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OH, I COULD TELL YOU A HUNDRED 

1816
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STORIES LIKE THAT. 

1817
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I COULD TELL YOU STORIES ALL 

1818
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NIGHT LONG, BUT THE POLITICIANS 

1819
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MAY GET TIRED AND GO HOME. 

1820
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT WE ARE REALLY DOING 

1821
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMETHING. 

1822
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE SECURED $716 BILLION TO 

1823
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FULLY REBUILD THE UNITED STATES 

1824
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MILITARY. 

1825
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND AT MY DIRECTION, VERY 

1826
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EXCITING, BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE 

1827
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S AT, THE PENTAGON IS NOW 

1828
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WORKING TO CREATE THE SIXTH 

1829
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN ARMED 

1830
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FORCES, THE SPACE FORCE. 

1831
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 

1832
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE TO DO IT. 

1833
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE TO DO IT. 

1834
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THINK OF THAT, ISN'T THAT 

1835
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EXCITING? 

1836
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT. 

1837
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHAT IT IS. 

1838
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SATELLITES ARE GOING TO BE VERY 

1839
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-- THEY'RE HAPPENING. 

1840
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S WHERE IT IS FROM THE 

1841
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STANDPOINT. 

1842
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT 

1843
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ROCKETS GOING TO THE MOON. 

1844
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT MILITARY 

1845
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PROTECTION. 

1846
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR MILITARY OFFENSE AND 

1847
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DEFENSE, THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 

1848
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
U.S. SPACE FORCE. 

1849
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I WITHDREW THE UNITED 

1850
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-

1851
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, OR 

1852
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
CATASTROPHE, AND WE HAVE 

1853
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RECOGNIZED THE CAPITOL OF 

1854
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ISRAEL, AND OPENED THE AMERICAN 

1855
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 

1856
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 

1857
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE 

1858
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS AND 

1859
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. 

1860
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU KNOW THE EMBASSY WAS 

1861
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SUPPOSED TO COST $1.1 BILLION, 

1862
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU KNOW THAT? 

1863
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND EVERY PRESIDENT SAID WE'RE 

1864
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GOING TO APPROVE IT. 

1865
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY NEVER DID. 

1866
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GOT TO 

1867
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OFFICE, THEY FOUND NOT SO EASY. 

1868
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVERY COUNTRY SAID PLEASE DON'T 

1869
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DO IT. 

1870
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SO I JUST TURNED OFF THE PHONE. 

1871
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DON'T WANT TO TALK. 

1872
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I WAS GOING TO APPROVE IT ON 

1873
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MONDAY. 

1874
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID I'LL CALL THEM BACK ON 

1875
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TUESDAY. 

1876
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I CALLED MORE PEOPLE ON 

1877
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TUESDAY. 

1878
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 

1879
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THE EMBASSY. 

1880
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OH, GEE. 

1881
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SORRY, IT'S DONE. 

1882
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY OBAMA AND 

1883
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUSH AND CLINTON, AND MANY, 

1884
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MANY, ALL THE WAY BACK DIDN'T 

1885
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
DO IT. 

1886
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE, AND WE DID 

1887
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT. 

1888
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COST 

1889
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
$1.1 BILLION. 

1890
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
$1.1BILLION. 

1891
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND ONE OF THE GENERALS WALKED 

1892
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IN, WOULD YOU SIGN THIS? 

1893
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE SIGNED DONALD. 

1894
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND BY THE WAY, WHAT IS IT I'M 

1895
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIGNING, I SIGN A LOT OF 

1896
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
PAPERS. 

1897
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SCARY. 

1898
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU'RE SIGNING SO MANY PAPERS. 

1899
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID WHAT IS THIS? 

1900
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SIR, WE'RE BUILDING THE UNITED 

1901
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

$1.1BILLION SIR. 

1904
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WE'RE BUILDING A ONE STORY 

1905
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUILDING. 

1906
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ANY BUILDERS IN HERE FROM úWISC 

1907
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU'D DO IT FOR ABOUT $200,000, 

1908
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT? 

1909
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S TRUE. 

1910
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID HOW DO YOU SPEND $1. 

1911
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
$1.1 BILLION ON A ONE STORY 

1912
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STRUCTURE? 

1913
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S HALF SIGNED. 

1914
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT JUST SAYS DONALD. 

1915
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DIDN'T SEEN GET THE J FOR 

1916
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JOHN. 

1917
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
JUST SAYS DONALD, THEN YOU SEE 

1918
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S A DEAD STOP. 

1919
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID I'M NOT SIGNING IT. 

1920
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I CALLED UP A GREAT MAN, DAVID 

1921
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FRIEDMAN, HE'S THE AMBASSADOR 

1922
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TO ISRAEL. 

1923
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID DAVID, THEY WANT US TO 

1924
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUY THIS UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE 

1925
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SITE, AND THEY WANT US TO BUILD 

1926
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A BUILDING THAT'S GOING TO COST 

1927
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
$1.1 BILLION. 

1928
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NUMBER 1, IT PROBABLY WILL TAKE 

1929
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
25 YEARS, IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. 

1930
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LET'S GET THIS THING DONE 

1931
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IMMEDIATELY. 

1932
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE SAID SIR, CAN I CALL YOU 

1933
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BACK? 

1934
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HE CALLS ME BACK FOUR DAYS 

1935
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LATER. 

1936
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SAYS SIR, WE OWN THE BEST SITE 

1937
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IN JERUSALEM. 

1938
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ON THE SITE, SET BACK, WHICH 

1939
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT FOR SAFETY. 

1940
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
SET BACK IS A BUILDING. 

1941
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THE BUILDING IS NICE. 

1942
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT THE BEST LOCATION. 

1943
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK I CAN RENOVATE THE 

1944
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
BUILDING, SIR. 

1945
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I CAN DO IT FOR LESS THAN 

1946
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
$200,000. 

1947
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUE, TRUE STORY. 

1948
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
úTHAT'S A TRU 

1949
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I DO IT FOR LESS THAN $200,000. 

1950
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. 

1951
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
EVER. 

1952
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME, I  

1953
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. 

1954
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I SAID SPEND 4 OR 500,000, 

1955
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OKAY? 

1956
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S TOO LITTLE. 

1957
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND WE WENT OUT, AND WE BUILT 

1958
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

1960
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
