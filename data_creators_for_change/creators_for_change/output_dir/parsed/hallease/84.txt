- 2016 review, 2016 in review.
Yeah, take one. (claps)
So, 2016, praise God from
whom all blessings flow,
has ended, (laughs) and
what a year, you know?
What a, what a year.
I have a grateful jar
that I write little notes
to myself every time
something has happened
that I am grateful for,
and I will be reviewing
that grateful jar in this video, but also
I want to go ahead and review back,
at the beginning of the year
I made some proclamations
into the ether for the
year 2016 that I wanted
to have happen, so let's
check out some of those
and see how or if any
of them happened at all.
More financial stability... please.
So yeah, more financial stability,
I mean, I achieved that I guess,
I did get a raise this year, about midway
through the year I got a raise, which,
ooh, I am still trying, though,
something that I am still trying to do
is figure out a way to
have passive income.
Something very specific
that I said in that video
was that I wanted to sort
of diversify my income
to where only 50% of my income
came from what I do full time
with Big Picture Lab, the
specific company I work for.
Just don't like having all
the eggs in one basket,
you know what I'm saying?
I'm trying to diversify that.
I would love to do more voiceover work,
but like a character.
Ha!
So I did dabble in this,
I believe I vlogged
about it at some point,
I'll link to that in the Eye of Sauron.
And I have gotten a few things,
just little one-off things,
little quick things, mostly
for production friends,
people that are already
in production and know
that I have a decent
voice, and so they'll just
call me over, like, can you do
this thing for me right quick?
I'm like yeah sure, no problem.
Because I have all the equipment.
I did that, but I guess
becoming professional
in voiceover work, not so much,
mostly, not because I can't do it,
but just because to start off,
the market is very saturated,
and so to get into it you kind
of need to drop everything
and do it full time and be
constantly auditioning online,
and I don't have the time to do it.
So once again, tying into the first thing,
it isn't a way for me
to make passive income.
Again, it's fun and I enjoy doing it,
and when people need stuff,
all you gotta do is message me
and I'll totally do it for
you and we can figure out
a rate or whatever, but
doing it on that level
for some of these bigger voice
agencies that are out there,
eh, not my bag, baby.
I just don't have the time.
As you all know I am
married to Mister Hallease,
he is an amazing man, I love him dearly.
He is finishing up his
masters degree this May,
and so with that, I would
love for Mister Hallease
to find enjoyment and
pleasure in his work.
Yay, so Mister Hallease
did graduate in May
with his master's degree,
super proud of him.
And yeah, he graduated
with his master's degree
in nursing administration
and he now works here
in San Antonio, which is why I
now no longer live in Austin,
I now live here in San Antonio, Texas.
And he enjoys it a lot,
it's been a real blessing
to see him be able to
move away from the ER,
which is high stress,
and didn't get weekends
and things like that, to moving here,
and basically more or less going into
a nine to five situation,
Monday through Friday.
And also, the catalyst of
moving back here to San Antonio
has been awesome because
my family does live here,
and we are a lot closer to his family too,
it's not as far of a drive
to travel to see them.
So it's been a blessing in disguise
to be this close to family, my
sister is actually pregnant,
she's gonna have her child in March,
so it all, it all just seemed to align.
The day Mister Hallease told
me that he'd got this job
here in San Antonio, my sister messaged me
that same day letting me
know she was pregnant.
So it's like, sometimes, as they say,
you need to ride the wave,
it seems like God is pushing
you in a certain direction
and you need to just go with it.
So that's been cool.
All right, so let's get
into this grateful jar
stuffsy-stuffs, got 'em right here.
So January 2016, sans gluten,
right, so there we go,
let's talk about that.
Failed, that was a failed thing.
I started Sans Gluten as
its own separate channel
and then realized, I'm doing the most,
I'm doing a little too much,
collapsed it back into this channel.
It's not in here, but it should be,
in April I fricken did
VEDA, okay, and that was
the first time I've done
VEDA and it was successful.
I think a lot of y'all
actually know me now
because of VEDA, so booya,
I did a VEDA, bloop bloop.
June 5th, let's see, I started
the accountability group,
which is awesome, I love
meeting with them every month.
It really does lift my spirits
so much meeting with them.
June 28th through July 4th,
vacation, wedding in Telluride.
My friend who is also in
the accountability group
got married in Telluride, Colorado,
and I believe I made a
travel video about that.
And that was really cool,
it was a really cool
experience to see that
part of the country,
I've never been to Colorado, well I have,
when I was like eight, don't count.
It was really cool to check out,
I mean just a beautiful
part of our county.
July 23rd, South Padre.
We went to South Padre with my in-laws
on a little mini vacation and
that was a really good time.
I enjoyed that trip a lot.
July 29th,
(laughs)
oh yeah, that's really sweet.
On July 29th, Mister Hallease,
after he had been working
at his new job for a
week, casually said to me,
is this what happiness feels like?
He had been really stressed, you guys,
y'all don't even know,
the ER is stressful.
August 20th, camping
with our friends Diego
and Tiffany at McKinney Falls,
that was a great way to
bring in being 26 years old.
And it rained a lot, but it was still fun.
I enjoyed it, grateful I went.
August 25th,
oh, on August 25th I received an email
from a subscriber about her adopted son
and how much my channel was
just helping her with that.
And that was really nice,
really fought back tears,
fam, really fought back
tears on the email,
let me tell y'all.
September 2016, Boston.
Went to Boston for work and for pleasure.
And once again, got to see a part
of the country that I haven't seen before.
So that was really cool.
October 10th, Where I
Stay became a podcast.
Is this still ongoing, am
I still working on this?
Should I been done had
like five episodes, yes
and yes and yes, but I'm out here,
I'm trying, okay, so there.
And finally, December 4th 2016.
I ran a 10k.
So I mean, you know, was 2016 bad?
Was it?
I think the biggest thing
for 2016 was supposed to be
#getthesecoins, #dontgetgot, and I mean,
I'm working on it, 2016 felt like really
a preparatory year, it felt like a year
where I was beginning to
plant the seeds of things
that hopefully will be
beneficial and fruitful
in the year to come, I feel like
I went through a bit of a awakening,
I started my locks in 2016,
I completed a VEDA in
2016, which is like, what?
And it was good, it just felt like I was
planting a lot of seeds,
because that was all I could do.
I wasn't at the point
yet where I could make
a big leap or anything like that,
but I could just squirrel away
and do what I could in 2016.
In 2016 just overall I started adjusting
who I spent my time
with, I started adjusting
how I spent my time, I found
Thomas Frank's YouTube channel.
I'm already a pretty productive person,
but that really began
to drop in the catalysts
of how I can be even more productive,
how I can get more things accomplished.
I started my accountability
group with three
other women in 2016 and
we more or less meet
once a month and set goals for ourselves.
Do we be hitting them goals?
Not so much, but it's also
just a really good time
to just fellowship with other women
that are trying to just
be out here and do things,
and the group is diverse
enough in our interests
and our backgrounds that
it's just really beneficial.
So I like I said, 2016
does feel like the time
that I used to just work on me, amen.
Work on me, but also it
taught me a little bit
about contentment, being
content at where I'm at
in my life, always striving for better,
always striving for
more, but being content
at where I'm at in the
journey, and realizing,
truly embodying and
realizing it's a journey.
So yeah, that's my 2016.
In the comments below let
me know how your 2016 went.
Don't get me wrong, politically,
socially, what the hell.
Personally, how was your 2016?
Was it good, were you feelin' it?
Did you do the thing?
Did you do the thing though?
So let me know in the comments below,
and I will see you when I see you.
Feel free to follow me on social media
if the spirit moves you, I
try to push out new videos
every Monday at noon, but
don't quote me on that,
I'm in these streets, I'm
trying to live my life,
I'm trying to be somebody,
above all things,
I will see you when I see you.
