this story amuses me because that Republicans are being to realize oh my god Donald Trump is so incompetent he might not even get tax reform done of course tax reform is nonsense it's not reform at all if you're gonna cut taxes still a bone and the other part of the story that's amusing is that they're like I don't know if we can cut taxes down this is really monstrous all right so let me go to Politico here to give you some background they explain congressional Republicans came back to Washington ready and eager to work on tax reform but they're still missing one thing a plan that's already funny that's triggered frustration among rank-and-file lawmakers who feel pressure from President Donald Trump to pass a tax reform bill but have seen no plans so they're like wait I know he bungled everything else but we're gonna get tax cuts for the rich right he still doesn't have a plan of course he doesn't have a plan he's an idiot but like that you've just dawned on you and you're like wait wait this is important this tax cuts were my donors if I gave Brant a guy who ran is a populist when he first one is now totally in bed with the elite says this time around there is no room for error this has got to be a home run I love the panic I said I love the smell of panic in the morning in Washington like this is tax cuts the rich we can't screw this up there's no room for error they'll take our old ages away then we'll be out of a job okay you know Dave brat ran the first campaign when he unseated Eric Cantor against the banks hey you know what the banks are ripping you office stuff now he's like but the banks are awesome got a lead on the rich and the billionaires also we gotta give about Jack Scott Donald Trump don't screw this up so Engrish goes on TV and a similar theme here he has a slightly different take on all this watch Trump is a Republican but he he doesn't get up in the morning and say my number-one job is to build the Republican Party I think he sincerely is wrestling with how do you make America great again I think he was very frustrated coming out of the summer with the inability to get things done on the part and basis and I think he's there's a little bit of floundering here that I think may be creative and healthy we are in a different world none of us fully know how the next six months are going to work out I think for the Republicans there's one absolute total imperative and that is to pass a tax cut by Thanksgiving and I think Trump has every reason to be worried that they won't be able to do it okay so there's three parts of that the second part is awesome first you have to fluff up Donald Trump in order to get him to pay attention now k'tano Trump is busy making America great again oh yeah yeah you're so unbearable okay then he goes on to say my favorite thing he said there's a little bit of floundering here but that is creative and healthy floundering into a compliment like that Donald you're doing a great job of floundering oh you're floundering is so creative oh I feel healthier already then he turns around though the real reason he's on TV now remember Donald because I know you watch Fox News that's why I'm on here we have to pass the tax cut that's how we all get paid tax cuts are important message delivered I got it so back to Politico house in ways House Ways and Means Committee member says it is frustrating and concerning that we don't have the details and yet we're going to be asked in 60 days to vote on something what did I tell you he's incompetent that there is no plan there's no three-dimensional chess he's not keeping his plans secret because he's gonna come out of bed and be like supplies here we go here's my great plan look this is so important this is them like trying to beat him up in the press but gently you're gonna get in motion let's go let's go right so Dell eventually had one until eventually pass one because all their political lives depending on it depend on it not because of the voters they serve the donors and this is priority number one through 99 for the donors okay so more from Politico they explain there are still disagreements among negotiators and closed-door meetings over crucial issues including the corporate tax rate with President Donald Trump pushing for a 15% rate that is unrealistic because of its cost now there's more issues but I want to just stop there for a second his plan that Trump's plan is to cut taxes for the rich almost all almost all of it not all of it but almost all of it goes to rich actually it raises taxes on the middle class in some ways it's a 7 to 8 trillion not million not billion trillion dollar tax cut seven to eight trillion dollars so even other Republicans who love trillions of dollars in tax cuts are like but wait a minute the deficit isn't going to be so gigantic that our decades-long lie about how we care about the deficit and it might get a little overexposed here like 15 percent that's a lot Donald is cutting from 35 to 15 percent is such a monstrous giveaway to the swamp and to the multinational corporations that fund the Republican Party all right more their objections there's a lack of a clear path forward on the 2018 budget which will be used as a vehicle for tax reform in other words we're just going to blow a hole in the 2018 budget so large we can't hide it and then finally allowing businesses to immediately write off the cost of equipment and other big investments that's another giant giveaway to corporations so they're like okay you get to deduct all that stuff right away remember the original plan was no no no what I do in tax cuts we're doing tax reform so if sure looks like we're cutting their taxes but we are going to take away other loopholes so that it balances out and then it has no effect on the deficit now they're like okay we're gonna do the giant tax cuts and Trump would also like to add loopholes in this one it's so hard that even Republicans are pushing back Senator John Thune says the president's been out there talking about a 15% rate the house has talked about 20 but to get it down from 35 to 20 it's about a hundred billion dollars per point so even he is recognizing look man I can do the math I'm at going from 35 to 28 a hundred billion dollars percentage that's one and a half trillion dollars he'd like to go down to fifteen that's two trillion dollars and that is way conservative like I said the real nonpartisan economists who have looked at it say no it's seven to eight trillion dollars so but for Thune he's like I don't I don't know how to put it two trillion dollar hole in the deficit and then pretend I'm for balanced budgets he's like help me out he's like can we go to twenty by the way if they went to twenty set of fifteen there would be a monstrous tax cut for the rich monstrous but this is how they moved over to windows how the right wing operates they go okay thirty five percent is too high the effective tax rate is actually in the teens because there's so many loopholes they don't pay those taxes so many the fortune 500 companies pay zero in taxes someone can get money back they hide their money offshore they do all those tricks they're not going to take those tricks away they're just gonna cut their taxes but they were saying there's met might be a bounce of reason to even what Trump is suggesting now if Trump executed it right it would be a classic Republican strategy you say thirty five I say fifteen okay fine let's do a deal on twenty or twenty five holy cow you just actually cut trillions of dollars in taxes and can't cover for it right but part of their problem is that Trump is not doing it competently so he's bundling it and I'm sorry he's being creative he's creative creatively floundering oh I don't know let's just give the rich everything why don't we just give them everything I'm rich let's just give it to him another opponents are like oh yeah so Paul Ryan saying look let's just do a huge tax cut to twenty two and a half percent that's really really low and Ryan said on the fifteen percent a number he said those numbers are really hard to make work the reality is his proposal of twenty two and a half percent is also impossible to make work they don't care about balanced budgets they never cared about the deficits they just want to be able to get away with one of the greatest American robberies of our lifetimes they think Trump is too stupid he's asking for too much and they won't be able to get away with it like look just take a couple of trillion dollars off the table and give it to our donors and we'll be able to cover that up get on board you schmuck that's the debate the Republican Party's having but either way you're about to be robbed support
