1
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:11,581
>> SO PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL STAND

2
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:12,081
BY YOU THROUGHOUT?

3
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,850
>> I KNOW HE WILL STAND BY ME,

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,419
HE CALLED ME THIS AFTERNOON AND

5
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:17,387
SAID HE STANDING BY ME.

6
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:19,622
>> Tucker: WE ARE STILL

7
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:22,492
COVERING THE BATTLE OVER JUDGE

8
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:24,494
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION TO THE

9
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:27,030
SUPREME COURT AND ITS EXPOSING

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,398
FAULT LINES AND IDEAS THAT SOME

11
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:31,234
OF US ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH.

12
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:34,237
CHRISTINE SETSER IS PRESIDENT OF

13
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:34,904
NEW HEIGHTS COMMUNICATIONS.

14
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,740
MAISIE HARGROVE NO SAID

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,841
SOMETHING REMARKABLE.

16
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,810
SHE IS A SITTING U.S. SENATOR OF

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,314
COURSE, AND SHE SAID THAT MEN,

18
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:46,049
ALL MEN ARE IMPLICATED IN

19
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,583
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND WOMEN, ALL

20
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,252
WOMEN MUST BE BELIEVED BECAUSE

21
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:50,253
THEY ARE WOMEN.

22
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:52,021
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN IDEA THAT

23
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:52,722
WOULD CUT AGAINST THE WESTERN

24
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:54,824
UNDERSTANDING OF JUSTICE.

25
00:00:54,824 --> 00:00:57,026
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S EXACTLY

26
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:58,828
WHAT SHE SAID BUT I DO KNOW THAT

27
00:00:58,828 --> 00:01:00,397
THERE IS SOMETHING PARTICULAR

28
00:01:00,397 --> 00:01:02,299
ABOUT CRIMES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

29
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,833
AND ACCUSATIONS OF

30
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,235
SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND THAT IS,

31
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:05,969
IT'S THE ONE CRIME THAT AT LEAST

32
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,074
I CAN THINK OF IN WHICH THE

33
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:11,841
PRESUMPTION OR BURDEN OF PROOF

34
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:15,445
IS ON THE WOMAN TO SAY SHE

35
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:15,979
REALLY IS A VICTIM.

36
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,250
LAST YEAR I HAD MY COURSE, CAR

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,851
STOLEN.

38
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,586
WHEN I REPORTED IT, IT WAS NOT

39
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:25,489
ASKED WHAT DID YOU DO WRONG TO

40
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:26,123
ALLOW YOUR CAR BE STOLEN.

41
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:27,724
>> Tucker: IT BUT YOU WERE

42
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:28,725
ASKED QUESTIONS LIKE, DID YOU

43
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:31,628
LEAVE THE KEYS IN THE CAR, OF

44
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:32,796
COURSE YOU ARE.

45
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:34,431
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS A MORE

46
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,866
DELICATE ISSUE FOR OBVIOUS

47
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,067
REASONS, BUT DO YOU THINK THAT

48
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:38,635
OUR SNEERS OF JUSTICE HAVE

49
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:39,069
CHANGED?

50
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:42,105
IN OTHER WORDS, IS THE BURDEN OF

51
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:42,873
PROOF LOWER?

52
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:44,241
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE IDEA THAT

53
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:45,942
A PERSON IS INNOCENT UNTIL

54
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:46,877
PROVEN GUILTY?

55
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,311
WE SEE LAWMAKERS CHALLENGING

56
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:49,679
THAT IDEA.

57
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,849
>> I DO BUT THERE ARE CASES OF

58
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:53,784
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RATE THAT,

59
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:56,086
FOR ONE THING THE VAST MAJORITY

60
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:56,887
OF WOMEN NEVER COME FORWARD AND

61
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:59,256
THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS FOR

62
00:01:59,256 --> 00:01:59,589
THAT.

63
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:00,924
ONE IS ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT

64
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:03,260
WOULD GET TO GET TO TRIAL OR GET

65
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,427
TO A CONVICTION.

66
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:07,397
ANOTHER REASON IS ALL THE ISSUES

67
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:10,433
AROUND SHAME, AND THE FINAL

68
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:11,134
REASON IS SOME OF THE THINGS

69
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:14,805
THAT ARE PLAYING OUT WITH

70
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:15,539
KAVANAUGH WHICH IS PARTICULAR

71
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,041
ISSUES AROUND MEMORY.

72
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,611
WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

73
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,111
TRAUMATIC EVENTS.

74
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:23,547
>> SO THIS IS A RECOVERED MEMORY

75
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:25,682
THAT WE NOW KNOW CAME OUT AND

76
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:27,251
PSYCHOTHERAPY, DOESN'T MEAN IT'S

77
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:29,419
FALSE AND DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE

78
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,120
A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE

79
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,423
RECOVERED MEMORY IS FALSE.

80
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:35,592
AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS LIKE

81
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:37,995
THAT BUT, IT MEANS THE REST OF

82
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:39,630
US HAVE TO ASK REAL QUESTIONS

83
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,697
ABOUT IT.

84
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:42,065
YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING THE

85
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,834
STANDARDS OUGHT TO BE DIFFERENT,

86
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,870
THAT WE SHOULD GIVE HER THE

87
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,504
PRESUMPTION OF HONESTY AND

88
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:48,472
THAT'S NOT HOW OUR JUSTICE

89
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:48,906
SYSTEM WORKS.

90
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,607
IS IT?

91
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,743
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

92
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:54,645
YOU AND YOUR VIEWERS TO KNOW THE

93
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,380
CONTEXT OF IT, WHICH IS THAT

94
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,614
THERE ARE NO MORE INSTANCES OF

95
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:01,084
FALSE ACCUSATION AROUND AND RAPE

96
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:03,387
AND SIMILAR CRIMES AS THERE IS

97
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,321
FOR ANY OTHER CRIME.

98
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,724
>> Tucker: HOLD ON, I'M NOT

99
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:07,224
SAYING OTHERWISE.

100
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:09,059
I'M SAYING THERE IS A MUCH

101
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:10,728
HIGHER INCIDENCE OF FALSE MEMORY

102
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,796
AND RECOVERED MEMORY CASES THAN

103
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:13,664
IN CONVENTIONAL CASES.

104
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,332
THAT'S TRUE AND IT'S BEEN LOOKED

105
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:16,867
AT EXTENSIVELY BY SOCIAL

106
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:17,835
SCIENTISTS, AND THERE'S NOT MUCH

107
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:20,604
DEBATE ABOUT THAT.

108
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:21,939
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S FALSE,

109
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,208
BUT IF JUSTICE IS YOUR GOAL THEN

110
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,809
YOU HAVE TO ASK HARD QUESTIONS.

111
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:29,046
BUT AGAIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

112
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:29,813
HAVE WE CHANGED STANDARDS OR

113
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:34,284
HAVEN'T WE?

114
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:36,620
>> AGAIN, NO ONE SAID THAT

115
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,221
EXACTLY.

116
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:38,389
>> WILL HERE IS RICHARD

117
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,523
BLUMENTHAL SAYING THE ONUS IS ON

118
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,026
HIM TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.

119
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:43,060
IT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS?

120
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,962
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE OPPOSITE

121
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:46,330
OF HOW IT WORKS.

122
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,999
>> HE SAID IT ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T

123
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:49,633
HAPPEN, FABRICATION.

124
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,235
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT HE IS

125
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:54,004
ASKING FOR A VERY LARGE

126
00:03:54,004 --> 00:03:54,705
PROMOTION TO THE SUPREME COURT

127
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,840
OF THE UNITED STATES SO YOU WANT

128
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,242
SOMEONE THAT HAS IMPECCABLE

129
00:03:58,242 --> 00:03:59,243
CHARACTER WHOSE MOTIVE CAN

130
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:00,444
ABSOLUTELY NOT BE QUESTIONED AND

131
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:03,147
HE IS GIVEN US NOTHING BUT

132
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:03,447
DOUBT.

133
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:07,217
>> SO THESE ARE LAWMAKERS, THE

134
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:08,452
MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN OUR

135
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:11,021
SOCIETY AND THEY DETERMINE WHAT

136
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,424
OUR LAWS ARE BY DEFINITION.

137
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:16,360
THEY ARE SAYING ACCUSED HAS AN

138
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,129
OBLIGATION AND RESPONSIBILITY TO

139
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,663
COME FORWARD WITH EVIDENCE TO

140
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:20,598
REBUT THE CLAIMS.

141
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:21,332
THAT IS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE

142
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:25,102
OF ENGLISH, COMMON-LAW, AND NO

143
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:29,407
ONE HAS EVER SAID THAT.

144
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:34,645
>> WHAT I THINK SHOULD HAPPEN,

145
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:35,846
WHAT DR. FORD AND RAMIREZ SAID

146
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,215
SHOULD HAPPEN IS THAT THERE

147
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:38,983
SHOULD BE AN FBI INVESTIGATION.

148
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:41,419
>> HE'S SAYING JUDGE KAVANAUGH

149
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,489
SHOULD COME FORWARD TO RESPOND

150
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:45,656
OR REBUT TO THE CHARGES.

151
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:46,958
>> I THINK IF WE ARE GOING TO

152
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,327
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT

153
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,628
WHETHER OR NOT THESE THINGS

154
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,130
HAPPEN AND HE DOESN'T WANT AN

155
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,297
FBI INVESTIGATION WHICH BY THE

156
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:58,436
WAY, HE DOES NOT, THEN -- >> HE

157
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,638
ACCUSES YOU OF SOMETHING WITH NO

158
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:01,639
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OR

159
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,440
EYEWITNESSES, AND IT'S A

160
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,141
SEX CRIME THAT WOULD DESTROY

161
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:06,644
YOUR REPUTATION AND IN YOUR

162
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:07,845
FAMILY.

163
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,614
YOU NOW HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION

164
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:11,249
OR RESPONSIBILITY AS A SENATOR

165
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,184
FROM CONNECTICUT SAYS, TO READ

166
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:14,452
ABOUT THAT.

167
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:18,890
>> YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

168
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,126
DEFEND YOURSELF.

169
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,695
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS

170
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:28,433
SAID, -- >> SO YOU WANT -- IF

171
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,534
YOU CAN'T FIND EVIDENCE TO

172
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:30,902
DISPROVE THE CHARGE, WHICH HAS

173
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:32,270
NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT IN THE

174
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,839
FIRST PLACE, THEN YOU ARE

175
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,307
PRESUMED GUILTY.

176
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,309
>> IS ANYONE SAYING HE'S GOING

177
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,044
TO GO TO JAIL?

178
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:39,311
NO.

179
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,479
HE'S SAYING HE'S GOING TO BE A

180
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,982
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

181
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:46,951
>> MULTIPLE WITNESSES SAY YOU

182
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,420
DIDN'T AND NOW WE ARE SAYING

183
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,055
THAT THIS GUY HAS TO PROVE HE IS

184
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:50,455
INNOCENT.

185
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:54,459
YOU REALLY WANT TO LIVE IN THAT

186
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:54,826
COUNTRY?

187
00:05:54,826 --> 00:05:56,161
HONESTLY, SINCERE QUESTION.

188
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:58,263
>> SINCE THEY, ANSWERED,

189
00:05:58,263 --> 00:05:59,931
