1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,399
MORE NEWS OUT OF NORTH KOREA,
NORTH KOREA FIRED A BALLISTIC

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:07,590
MISSILE TODAY, WEDNESDAY
MORNING, THAT'S WHAT TIME IT IS

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,360
THERE -- IT IS ALSO WEDNESDAY OF
NEXT WEEK, THEY DON'T TELL YOU

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,750
THAT -- ODDLY ENOUGH THAT DEFIED
DEMANDS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,890
THAT THEY HOLD THEIR WEAPONS
PROGRAM.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,230
IT RAISES THE STAKES IN

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,779
WHAT COULD BECOME A NUCLEAR
FUELED BATTLE ON THE KOREAN

8
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,320
PENINSULA.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,010
THIS IS THE NEWS TODAY, WHICH
MEANS THAT THIS, FROM WHEN

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,950
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSED THE
UNITED NATIONS, WAS IT LAST

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,950
MONTH?

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,950
>>THEY ALL BLUR TOGETHER.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,950
>>EARLIER, WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
ADDRESSED THE UNITED NATIONS.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,350
>>ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE
MISSION FOR HIMSELF, AND FOR HIS

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,860
REGIME.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,260
THE UNITED STATES IS READY,
WILLING, AND ABLE, BUT

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,150
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL NOT BE
NECESSARY.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,340
>>HERE ARE THE DETAILS ON WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY FROM THE NEW YORK

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,340
TIMES --

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:27,619
>>AGAIN, INDICATIONS WOULD BE
THAT, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE,

21
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,780
NORTH KOREA PLOWS AHEAD AND DOES
WHAT IT ONCE REGARDLESS OF

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,790
WHATEVER ANY U.S. ADMINISTRATION
SAYS.

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,790
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,319
WILL TRY TO BLAME THIS ON OBAMA,
THAT THEY LEFT THIS MESS, BUT

25
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,319
THE REALITY IS THAT THINGS HAVE
GONE BEST FOR NORTH KOREA WHEN

26
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,250
WE HAVE ENGAGED WITH THE MOST,
WE ARE ENGAGING NOW WITH THEM

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,490
LEAST, BUT THIS PROBLEM HAS
EXISTED FOR AMERICAN PRESIDENTS

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,229
SINCE THE END OF THE KOREAN
POLICE ACTION.

29
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,229
>>THE WAY THE TIME WORKS IS IT
WAS 3 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IN

30
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,680
1958 -- EXCEPT THEY HAVE NUKES
NOW.

31
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,360
IT IS WEIRD BECAUSE THEY

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,760
TOOK TWO MONTHS OFF BETWEEN WHEN
THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY SHOOTING

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,130
OFF A ROCKET EVERY FEW WEEKS, IF
NOT MORE OFTEN, AND FOLKS

34
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,450
ARE WONDERING WHY IS THAT
HAPPENING.

35
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,310
>>LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT GRAPHIC
21 --

36
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:35,310
>>THIS HAS 
BEEN A PARTICULARLY

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,670
BUSY YEAR FOR NORTH KOREA

38
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,040
TESTING WEAPONS.

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,570
>>ONE APPROACH COULD SAY THEY
WEREN'T READY WITH THIS MISSILE

40
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,820
YET, IT WAS DELAYED, SO THEY
WANTED -- THEY COULD NOT LAUNCH

41
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,940
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T READY,
MAYBE THEY HAD A TECHNOLOGICAL

42
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,920
PROBLEM OR IN THE MEANTIME
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ARE

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,890
PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT TO ASIA TO
TRY TO RALLY SUPPORT, AND ENVOY

44
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,780
WAS SENT TO NORTH KOREA FROM
CHINA, MAYBE THEY WANTED TO SEE

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,680
HOW HOT CHINA WANTED TO EXERT
PRESSURE OR NOT, WHAT KINDS OF

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,150
THINGS THEY WANT TO SAY IN THEIR
MEETING IN BETWEEN THEM, AND

47
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,540
ALSO THERE WAS THE LEVYING OF
SANCTIONS FROM THE UN SECURITY

48
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,040
COUNCIL AND INCREASE SANCTIONS,
PUTTING NORTH KOREA BACK ON THE

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,330
LIST OF STATE SPONSORS OF
TERROR, MAYBE THEY HAD SOME

50
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,420
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES THEY
NEEDED TO HANDLE.

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
>>

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
THIS IS BEEN A PARTICULARLY BUSY
YEAR FOR NORTH KOREA TESTING.

53
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
>> THEY TOOK SOME TIME OFF.

54
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,420
THEY WEREN'T READY WITH THIS
MISSILE YET, IT WAS DELAYED.

55
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,420
MAYBE THEY HAD A TECHNOLOGICAL
PROBLEM OR IN THE MEANTIME

56
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,420
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OUR
PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT TO

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
ASIA TO TRY TO RALLY SUPPORT
THERE.

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
MAYBE THEY WANTED TO SEE JUST
EXACTLY HOW HOT CHINA

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
WANTED TO EXERT PRESSURE OR NOT
OR KINDS OF THINGS I WANTED

60
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,420
TO SAY IN THEIR MEETING IN
BETWEEN THEN.

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
THEN ALSO THERE WAS THE LEVYING
OF SANCTIONS IN THE UN SECURITY

62
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
COUNCIL AND INCREASED SANCTIONS
AND PUTTING NORTH KOREA BACK ON

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,760
THE LIST OF STATE TROOPS AND
MAYBE THEY HAD SOME KIND OF

64
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,910
INITIATIVE ISSUES THEY NEEDED TO
SEE TO KIND OF HANDLE THE

65
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,070
REPERCUSSIONS OF THAT CHANGING
POLICY.

66
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,430
>>ALL THAT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

67
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,670
SO IS NORTH KOREA WAITING FOR
THE RETURN OF DENNIS RODMAN.

68
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,360
MOST LIKELY IT'S THAT PYONGYANG,
I KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE IT WELL

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:06,390
BECAUSE I WATCH MASH, THEY ARE
OPERATING ON THEIR OWN TIMETABLE

70
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,120
AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,130
IF THERE WAS A COMPELLING REASON
TO SCALE BACK, IF THEY ARE

72
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,430
ENGAGED AND MAYBE THEY WILL.

73
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,089
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT A
DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION

74
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,279
WOULD HAVE NORTH KOREA ENGAGED
IN A MORE MEANINGFUL WAY.

75
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,599
BUT THEY ARE HEADING FOR THEIR
70TH ANNIVERSARY AND I

76
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:29,979
THINK THEY WANT TO SAY OUR
NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS COMPLETE.

77
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,610
AND WE ARE READY TO BOMB.

78
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,280
>>AND THEY WILL DO IN THE KIND
OF COMMERCIAL PROPAGANDA

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,290
THAT MIMICS A CIALIS COMMERCIAL.

80
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,789
LIKE YOU'RE GETTING UP THERE IN
AGE, MAKE SURE YOUR HEART

81
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,189
IS HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR NUCLEAR
ACTIVITY.

82
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:53,680
WE ARE GOING TO SEE A WEIRD
PROPAGANDA VIDEO THAT WILL

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,939
KINDLY OFFSET HOW TERRIFYING IT
IS THEY ARE DOING THIS.

84
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,939
>>YOU

85
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:06,199
THINK KIM JONG UN IS GOING TO
HAVE A WEIRD PROPAGANDA VIDEO?

86
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:18,419
>> OF COURSE THEY ARE TRYING
TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF

87
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:27,490
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

88
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,669
THE PERSON THAT
TOOK NORTH KOREA OFF THE LIST OF

89
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:37,259
STATE SPONSORS OF TERROR WAS
GEORGE W. BUSH.

90
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,449
NO ONE HAS SOLVED IT.

91
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,979
TRUMP HAS UNDERCUT Ã± YOU WANT TO
SEND A MESSAGE THAT IF YOU BACK

92
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,919
OFF YOUR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THINGS
ARE GOING TO GO A LOT BETTER FOR

93
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,590
YOU BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS
HAPPENED ANY RON, IF THEY AGREE

94
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,150
TO A NUCLEAR DEAL AND TRUMP HAS
DONE NOTHING TO TRY TO UNDERCUT

95
00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:03,800
THAT, THAT PROMISE HAS NOT BEEN
DELIVERED ON AND IT IS A LOT OF

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,150
PEOPLE'S FAULT, BUT IT SEEMS
LIKE IF YOU ARE NORTH KOREA AND

97
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,120
YOUR PRIORITY IS TO STAY IN
POWER YOU DON'T SEE A CLEAR PATH

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,240
TOWARD STAYING IN POWER THAT
INVOLVES GIVING UP YOUR

99
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

100
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
>> THE COUNTRY HAS MADE STRIDES
IN ITS BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
SINCE KIM JONG UN TOOK
POWER.

102
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
NOW WASHINGTON HAS MAXIMUM
PRESSURE AND SANCTIONS TO

103
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
STOP NORTH KOREA FROM REACHING
THE STAGE WHERE THEY WILL

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
BE ABLE TO DELIVER A NUCLEAR
WARHEAD ON ITS ICBMS.

105
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
BUT THEIR LEADER SAYS THIS
COUNTRY WILL CONDUCT MORE

106
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
MISSILE TEST TO HONE ITS
CAPABILITIES.

107
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
I READ THIS AND IT MAKES SENSE.

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
THEY WANT TO BE READY BY THE
TIME THEY TURN 70.

109
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING FOR.

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHICH
ADMINISTRATION YOU GET TO BLAME.

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
THERE WAS A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY
WHERE THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
DIVIDE ON BECAUSE THEY WERE AT
THE BARE MINIMUM HUNDREDS

113
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
AND THOUSANDS OF CONFIDENT
PROFESSIONALS.

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
HE IS NOT MIKE FLYNN, DAVID
CLARK, SARAH HUCKABEE

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
SANDERS, OR MIKE HUCKABEE, OR
ANY OF THE TRUMP KIDS.

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
HE IS NOT STEVE BANNON OR ROGER
STONE.

117
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,150
HE IS NOT A RAVING LUNATIC WHO
SHOULD HAVE NOT HAVE NO

118
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,499
INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER.

119
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:50,180
HE WILL GO DOWN AS THE WORST
SECRETARY OF STATE IN AMERICAN

120
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,530
HISTORY.

121
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,110
HE HAS NO BUSINESS AT THIS JOB.

122
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,910
THE MERE FACT THAT WE WANT TO
LIKE HIM NOW BECAUSE HE HATES

123
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,839
TRUMP AND TRUMP HATES HIM IS A
POINT IN HIS FAVOR, BUT THE

124
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,819
ONLY POINT.

125
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,539
THE NOTION THAT THIS
ADMINISTRATION SELECTED AS THE

126
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:16,900
GUY TO LEAD THE STATE DEPARTMENT
IN THESE TROUBLING TIMES, THAT

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,379
THEY WOULD HIRE AN OIL EXECUTIVE
TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE

128
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,639
IS AN OUTRAGE THAT WE HAVE LET
SLIP OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE

129
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,449
WE HAVE HAD 1000 MORE.

130
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,909
BUT HE HAS NO BUSINESS IN THE
JOB.

131
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:33,139
THE STORY IS THAT HE DOES NOT
WANT THE JOB AND WE ARE

132
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,189
SEEING PROFESSIONALS LEAVE THE
STATE DEPARTMENT IN DROVES.

133
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,129
THERE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPACT
FOR THAT IN THAT EVENTUALLY WE

134
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:46,680
WILL RUN OUT, OF THE NORTH KOREA
EXPERTS PARTIALLY I DON'T BLAME

135
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,719
THEM FOR LEAVING BECAUSE THEY
ARE LIKE NO ONE IS LISTENING TO

136
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:52,719
ME.

137
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,099
MY LIFE IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT
NORTH KOREA HAS DONE, WE

138
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,740
KNOW THEY ARE NOT BEING INVITED
TO THE TABLE, AND WE KNOW

139
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,139
THAT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO REX
TILLERSON DEVOTED TONS OF

140
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,879
STATE DEPARTMENT RESOURCES TO
FINDING HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS.

141
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,999
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP
TOUTING REX TILLERSON AS AN

142
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,509
ANSWER TO ANYTHING.

143
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,710
HE IS NOT AND IT IS AS BAD A
MOVE AS TRUMP HAS MADE IN THE

144
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,479
FRACTIOUS DANGEROUS WORLD THAT
WE LIVE IN, THAT HE APPOINTED AN

145
00:08:19,479 --> 00:00:00,000
OIL EXECUTIVE FROM EXXON TO RUN
THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
