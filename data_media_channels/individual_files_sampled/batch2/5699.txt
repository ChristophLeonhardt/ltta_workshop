hey with us now we've got columnist for The New York Times Brett Stevens his recent column is entitled Donald Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors also with us we have Martin London he was a principal lawyer for vice president Spiro Agnew Martin wrote a piece in Time magazine entitled I was a lawyer for Spiro Agnew president Trump should consider resigning Martin let's start with you why should Donald Trump consider resigning he should consider resigning because it's only gonna get worse we already have everybody you know the rats are leaving the ship he's lost gates Papadopoulos Colin Flynn now pecker he'll probably lose weiselberger and others from the Trump Organization and we don't know a quarter of what's in the pocket of the prosecutor and if he has any interest at all in not only saving his skin but the skin of his child his children his son-in-law and his grandchildren his daughter this is a time when he's got to seriously think about it now is he capable of that of serious thinking frankly I doubt it if he's going to be advised by people like clown Giuliani and the people who don't know that the truth is truth then he's not gonna get anywhere the national interest what would drove the Agnew resignation yeah and so uh did you push Alex I'm just curious the Joe Scarborough memorial seven second delay there let's hope so okay that's okay I I embarrassed myself many years ago so you don't have to so let's go right now to Bret Stevens Bret you talked about Donald Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors yesterday noah rothman from commentary was on yesterday and he really he laid it bare i and i think he's exactly right we have the president the united states talking like a mob boss and saying that the federal government should ban ban people who actually cooperate with federal prosecutors undermined more wrongdoing that that should be banned if if that's not open obstruction of justice coming from the chief law enforcement officer in america i don't know what is it's somewhat ironic coming from a president who advocated torture when he entered entered the office and had to be dissuaded by secretary by general Jim Jim mattis that torturing suspect should be okay in his view but flippin suspects is which has been a tradition of the Justice Department of legal officers for four decades if not longer should somehow be be illegal and know it was exactly right what we're hearing what we're watching doesn't resemble any President of the United States we've seen except I mean perhaps a handful a handful of exceptions it comes from whether it's it's the Mafia or or or organized crime or to some extent in in in the in his demands for loyalty from Jeff Sessions it reminds me of the dictators he's so admires you know I think that President Trump wants cabinet secretaries walking around him in the way that Kim Jong Un's note-takers do you know in those pictures when he's giving field guidance and these guys have their little notebooks open right that's what he looks for in in an attorney general he doesn't want to he wants he wants Craven s and that's just not how this system system works yeah well actually Donald Trump said that after he came back from North Korea he wanted people working for him that acted the way Kim Jong Un's minions work for them I think they have to come to their knees what for before dressing them a jean we had this wonderful moment on the show yesterday where Elizabeth Brewer was being interviewed by mica mica asked about Donald Trump saying that flipping should be illegal and he really did everybody that was watching said my god this sounds like it's straight out of Goodfellas and Elizabeth said you know he really sounds like and then she just froze and said wait a second I write for the New York Times I better just not answer and then noah rothman with commentary said it immediately after he sounds like a mob boss man which is of course what you lay out when you have somebody talking about the you know his dirty rats flipping and we should make flipping illegal he really did sound like he was out of Goodfellas or one of the godfathers he really does it just not just that that interview too I mean but it was just incredible I mean sounds like a mob boss end up in a sort of you know gangster b-movie I mean there's that you know this is not that dialogue out of The Godfather but it's uh but it but it's it was it was shocking actually to hear any public official talking like that but to hear the President of the United States talking like that it's it's like we're in some new some different and awful dimension of reality it's it was awful and then the other thing you know was this this sort of naked appeal to man afford begging him not to not to flip on the part of both President Trump and Rudy Giuliani who president basically saying when he had a great respect for metaphor in this matter because they know you know he's had these these crushing legal bills from the first trial he's he's now looking at potentially a retrial which would be another mountain of legal bills he's looking at the the upcoming trial in DC and his attorney said at the end of the the trial this week that man for looking at his options well that seems to have really scared the bejesus out of out of trumpet and Giuliani and he had Giuliani go out and and basically make up make a proffer to man afford saying well you know we're advising the president I've advised burrs and not to pardons man for this until after the elected the investigation is over this basically bribing man for to keep his mouth shut yeah John Heilemann man affords broke how does who's paying all of his legal bills who's paying them yeah I mean the guys broke he's been broke do you know how excited retrial in federal court and then he has one coming up in DC then he may have who's paying these legal bills do we know well judge oh I do not know the answer that but apparently Martin does he have sad Billy he's suggesting to me passing me a note right here that says he thinks Donald Trump as big as legal bills so I asked you Martin what do you know about I don't know anything I don't have any facts but I know that he that Trump went out and went through himself and Giuliani made a very direct plea don't speak will pardon you in the end will pardon you in the end will pardon you in the end now and then he says he's not going to do it until after the second trial and who knows whether or not there's going to be another trial in West Virginia on those other counts so I don't know how anybody could afford that we're talking about tens of millions of dollars of legal fees and and do you know what when he if and when he gets the party he's just Madoff was just trading Camp fed for sink saying on the Hudson because that pardon does nothing to him nothing for him in New York State and New York State has got this guy by the whatever's because he's got old man attacks counts
