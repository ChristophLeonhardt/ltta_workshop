IT WILL BE HERE BEFORE YOU KNOW
IT, BACK TO YOU.
>> Harris: KEVIN CORKE,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LET'S BRING IN RONNA McDANIEL,
GREAT TO SEE YOU ALWAYS.
THE LAST TIME WE TALKED WE WERE
SPEAKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS, THE
RECORD FUND-RAISING THE RNC HAS
DONE.
THERE HAS BEEN EVEN MORE
MOVEMENT AS YOU MOVE UP TO THE
MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
>> WE RAISED OVER $252 MILLION
AND WHAT THAT TRANSLATES TO HIS
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, 25,000
FIELD ORGANIZERS, FIVE TIMES
MORE THAN WE HAD GOING INTO
2016, 540 STAFF ON THE GROUND IN
28 STATES.
WE ARE ALL ENERGIZED TO TURN OUT
OUR VOTE BUT WE HAD THE
INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THOSE
LAST-MINUTE DOORKNOBS, MAKE THE
CASE OF RESULTS VERSUS
RESISTANCE AND SHARE WHAT VOTERS
AND REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE TO
MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER.
>> Harris: THERE IS TYPICALLY
A HEADWIND, SOMETIMES UPWARDS OF
30 SEATS, BARACK OBAMA LOST
NORTH OF 60 IN HIS FIRST MIDTERM
ELECTION.
WHAT HAS MADE THE DIFFERENCE TO
TURN THE HEADWIND A LITTLE MORE
WIND AT YOUR BACK RIGHT NOW?
>> THE CHOICE IS VERY CLEAR.
AS DEMOCRATS HAVE OBSTRUCTED
THIS PRESIDENT EVERY STEP OF THE
WAY AND THE CULMINATION OF THE
KAVANAUGH HEARING, SEEING THE
INTERRUPTIONS, THE PAID
PROTESTERS, THAT THEY WOULD DO
ANYTHING THEY COULD TO STOP
BRETT KAVANAUGH FROM SERVING ON
THE BENCH AND YOU CONTRAST THAT
WITH THE RESULTS OF WHAT
REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT FORWARD FOR
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HIGHER
WAGES, 4 MILLION NEW JOBS, HIDE
THE
HIGH GDP, IT'S A CLEAR CONTRAST
AND IF VOTERS -- THE ONLY WAY
VOTERS WILL GET THIS DEMOCRACY
WORKING AGAIN IS TO READ RESIST
THE PLAYBOOK DEMOCRATS HAVE
COUNTED ON FOR THE PAST TWO
YEARS.
>> Harris: IT ALL KIND OF TIES
IN, A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES SAY
THEY WOULD LIKE THE PRESIDENT TO
SHOW UP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
YOU HAVE GIVEN THE ENDORSEMENT
LEVEL A SECOND TERM.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ENDORSES YOU,
I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW MANY HANDS
WILL GO AGAINST THAT.
>> I'M SO HONORED THAT THE
PRESIDENT CHOSE ME TO BE ONLY
THE SECOND WOMAN TO RUN THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE,
IT SHOWS HOW MUCH HE VALUES
WOMEN.
I WAS ELECTED UNANIMOUSLY AND
I'M HONORED TO HAVE HIS SUPPORT
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
SUPPORTING HIM IN THE REELECT.
>> Harris: HAVE YOU HAD A
CHANCE TO TALK THE WINNING
MESSAGE AND WHAT'S WORKING?
>> THE MESSAGE HAS TO BE THE
CONTRAST, THE PRESIDENT AND I
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
YOU HAVE TO PUT FORWARD TO
VOTERS WHAT'S HAPPENING, WHAT WE
CAN ACHIEVE IS A COUNTRY AND
WHAT WE WILL LOSE IF WE TURN
BACK THE CLOCK TO THE
NANCY PELOSI-CHUCK SCHUMER DARK
AGES.
WE RESTORED OUR COUNTRY AS A
GLOBAL LEADER, THERE IS IT SO
MANY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING FOR
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, LOWEST
UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY FOR THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC
COMMUNITIES.
DEMOCRATS ARE OFFERING NOTHING.
THEY'VE DONE NOTHING BUT RESIST
AND ABSTRACT.
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CASE TO
THE VOTERS, WHAT'S AT STAKE TO
LOSE AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THE
DEMOCRATS TAKE THE MAJORITY.
>> Harris: IT'S SO
INTERESTING, I KNOW THE
PRESIDENT IS GETTING READY TO GO
TO SOME PLACES WHERE YOU MIGHT
NOT OF THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE
CONTENTION LIKE ARIZONA, YOU'RE
SEEING CHANGE.
