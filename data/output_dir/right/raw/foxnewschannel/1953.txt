ACTING MORE GRACIOUSLY.

192
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,556
I THINK THE FACT IS IT'S

193
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:30,158
SANCTIONS AND PRESSURE.

194
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:30,959

SANCTIONS.

>>  WE'VE HAD SANCTIONS.

199
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,499
>>  THESE ARE SANCTIONS ON

200
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:37,866
COMPANY

201
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:38,133
COMPANIES.

202
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:40,402
>>  AND GETTING CHINA TO COME

203
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:40,769
ON BOARD.

204
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:41,937
>>  AND EVEN WITH THAT THE

205
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,538

00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:32,520
WAIT A SECOND WE'VE ABOUT

232
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,356
TALKING ABOUT HOW AMAZING THE

233
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:36,825
PRESIDENT'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS

234
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,493
ARE HERE AND CELEBRATING THE

235
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:39,461
FACT THESE THREE AMERICANS

236
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:40,895
CAME HOME GENE HEALTH,

237
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,230
PROSPERITY, INFORMATION.

238
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,231
>>  AND WITH INFORMATION.

239
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:44,232
>> SO THIS IS SOMETHING WHEN

240
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:47,502
YOU LOOK AT TYPE OF DIP MROMCY

241
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:50,005
IT'S LIKE DESTABILIZING

242
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,540
DIPLOMACY HE ENGAGES IN.

243
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,943
IT'S NOT ANYTHING ANYONE HAS

244
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:56,378
SEEN BEFORE FOR SXEERNSZ AND

245
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:57,278
IT THROWS THE OTHER SIDE OVER

246
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:59,047
THE GAME AND THEY'RE NOT SURE

247
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:00,882
WHAT TO EXPECT OR AND AND

248
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:01,983
THAT'S THE SECRET TO HIS

249
00:07:01,983 --> 00:07:03,418
SUCCESS AS IT RELATES TO

250
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,021
FOREIGN POLICY AND WHAT WE'VE

251
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:06,955
SEEN IN TERMS OF HOW HE

252
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:10,458
HANDLED HIMSELF DIPLOMATICALLY

253
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,360
AND PAYING ATTENTION AND HE'S

254
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,495
LIABLE TO JUST DO ABOUT

255
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:19,501
ANYTHING.

256
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:21,403
AND HE STEPS ON GOOD NEWS AND

257
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:31,780
GHOR NEWS.

258
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:32,981
GHOR NEWS.

259
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:34,482
AND SO I THINK OF IT AS JUST

260
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:35,417
THE OPPOSITE.

261
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:41,723
I THINK HE WAS SAYING GOOD

00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:51,966

>>  I CAN INTERRUPT I HAVE A

268
00:07:58,106 --> 00:07:59,441
LITTLE SOUND ON THAT.

00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:00,041
>>  GO RIGHT AHEAD YOU.

270
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,543

273
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,580
HARSH CRITICISM FOR PULLING

OBAMA WHO LEFT PARTY IN TATTER

288
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:33,942
WHICH ENABLED PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:36,044
TO BE ELECTED AND TWO PLAME

00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:37,445
HILLARY WHO THOUGHT ELECTION

BURNING FLAGS.

304
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,416

>>  IN TEN YEARS.

321
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,045
>>  IRANIANS WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:46,481
THAT.

324
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:47,882
I'M CURIOUS YOU HAVE INSIGHT

325
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:50,485
TO WHAT IT WAS THE EUROPEANS

326
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:51,386
WERE SO RESISTANT ABOUT

327
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:54,455
CHANGING THAT SUNSET POSITION.

328
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:55,590
>> I THINK THEY'RE RESISTANT

329
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,559
CHANGING ANYTHING ON A DEAL

330
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,460
THEY FEEL INVESTED IN AND GEEL

331
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,930
ABOUT LEGACY THEY GOT AND

332
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,964
BARACK OBAMA GOT WHO IS THEIR

333
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:04,065
INTERNATIONAL FRIEND AND IT'S

334
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:05,400
DIFFICULT TO CHANGE A DEAL

335
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,767
LIKE THAT.

336
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,502

337
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:08,436
MONEY KIM BETTER LIRKS THERE'S

338
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:11,005
A LOT OF ECONOMIC AK TICHTY

339
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:13,441
THAT'S WAS ALLOWED UNDER THIS

340
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:15,043
DEAL EUROPEANS IN PARTICULAR.

341
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:15,610
>>  ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN

342
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,444
UNDERSTAND THAT.

343
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:18,479
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID I

344
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:20,415
UNDERSTANDFY WERE THEM I WOULD

345
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:21,082
BE UPSET TOO.

346
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:23,985
HE HAS TO ASK IN THE BEST

347
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:25,153
INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES

348
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:27,021
AND GLOBAL FUTURE AND NATIONAL

349
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,923
SECURITY AND SAFETY OF AMERICA

350
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,024
AND QUITE FRANKLY THE WORLD

351
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:31,459
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DEAL.

352
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,161
I WOULD SHIRT AT THE THOUGHT

353
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,562
THAT PRESIDENT WHO RESEARCHED

354
00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:35,496
IT MET WITH PEOPLE AND

355
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:36,965
DISCUSSED IT AND DECIDED TO

356
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,233
MAKE THIS DECISION AND DEPOSIT

357
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,467
MAKE IT BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID

358
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,402
OF CRITICISM AND PEOPLE WOULD

359
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:43,605
SAY NOW THAT WE'VE DONE --

360
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,007
YOU'VE TORN DOWN A LEGACY

361
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:46,941
PORTION OF BARACK OBAMA.

362
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:48,543
IT WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT TO

363
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:49,544
BEGIN WITH AND PRESIDENT

364
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:50,545
SHOULD NOT STICK IN A BAD

365
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:50,845
DEAL.

366
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:51,980
THAT'S WHY HE ALSO PULLED OUT

367
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,982
OF THE PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE

368
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:55,383
ACCORD BECAUSE HE ANALYZED IT

369
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:56,985
AND DID NUMBERS AND AS I SAID

370
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:58,486
YESTERDAY I DO NOT THINK THAT

371
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,022
WE SHOULD, IN FACT, FUND A

372
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,423
NUCLEAR IRAN.

373
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:03,891
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE NOT

374
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:05,526
YOU KNOW HONEST AS IT RELATED

375
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:06,961
TO THEIR INSPECS OR ANYTHING

376
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,463
ELSE IS,SELF UP SUSPECTING AND

377
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:09,931
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

378
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,165

WHAT DO WE SEE RIGHT NOW.

409
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,483
WE SEE THE UNITED STATES

410
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:04,385
ISOLATED FROM ALLIES AND

411
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,487
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID REAL

412
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:08,523
CHOICE HERE IS NUCLEAR IRAN OR

413
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:13,528
WE GO TO WAR AND TAKE THEM

414
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:14,028
OUT.

415
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:15,163
HE HUG TODAY OUT.

416
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:16,964

417
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:17,932
MIDDLE EAST.

418
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:19,567
>>  AND LOVES THE DEAL.

419
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:20,468
WE'RE NOT ISOLATED.

420
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:22,403
>>  LAST WORD TO GREG.

421
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,538
>>  AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

422
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:25,506
THIS IS THE PATTERN THAT WE'VE

423
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:26,074
SEEN.

424
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:28,009
START -- HE COMES IN AND

425
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,044
CREATES CHAOS BY TURNING TABLE

426
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,112
OVER AND THAT TURNS TO A

427
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:32,947
CERTAIN KIND OF UNCERTAINTY SO

428
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:36,384
WHEN YOU START NEGOTIATE THE

429
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,185
OTHER SIDE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT

430
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:38,486
YOU'RE DOING AND LEFT THE DOOR

431
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:39,053
OPEN.

432
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,922
THIS IS EXACTLY -- WHAT I SEE

433
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:42,690
THIS AS KIND OF A REPLAY OF

434
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,425
NORTH KOREA AND NORTH KOREA

435
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:47,428
STARTS TO BEGIN WITH CHAOS AND

436
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:50,865
MEDIA AND DEM DEMOCRATS THIS

437
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,467
IS COMPLETE DEJA VUE.

438
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,569
WE WILL LIVE THROUGH THIS SIX

439
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:55,169
MONTHS AGO.

440
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,939
>>  LET DHOYM A GOOD DEAL.

441
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:00,007
LET DMOYM A DEAL BASED ON

442
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,008
BENEFIT OF EXPERIENCE THAT

443
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:01,943
WHAT HE'S LEARNED FROM THIS

444
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:03,444
DEAL WHAT THEY THINK WORKS AND

445
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:03,945
DOESN'T WORK.

446
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:05,980
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF YOU KNOW

447
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,415

00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:09,350
NOPE, NO VIOLATIONS HERE FROM

449
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,017
US.

450
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:11,486
WINK, WINK, WHILE THEY'RE

451
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:13,087
CONTINUING TO BUILD A NUCLEAR

452
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,388
IRAN.

453
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:14,989
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE HERE.

454
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:15,957
LET THE PRESIDENT GO THROUGH

455
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,024
IT.

456
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:19,427
MAKE STRONG CHOICES.

457
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:20,528
BASED ON FACTS AND INFORMATION

458
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:23,030
AND HE DID WIN THE ELECTION

459
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,965
AND IT'S HISPREROGATIVE AND

460
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:26,467
THERE'S A TEAM IN PLACE TO

461
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:26,901
MAKE

462
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:26,934

463
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:27,935
TO MAKE SOLID DECISIONS.

464
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,470
>>  YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE A

465
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,439

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,487

00:13:51,526 --> 00:00:00,000
DEAL EXCEPT PRESIDENT TRUMP
