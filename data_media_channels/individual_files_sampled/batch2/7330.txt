A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION BREAKING IN JUST THE HOUR OR TWO BEFORE WE WENT LIVE, BUT DEVIN NUNES TODAY SAYS THAT BECAUSE FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW AT LEAST, THE FBI IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION BY HIS COMMITTEE, BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION NO ONE FROM THE FBI CAN BE USED TO BRIEF THE COMMITTEE ON ANY INFORMATION ABOUT DOSSIERS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION. SO IT'S KIND OF A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AND THE FBI PROVIDING INFORMATION WHERE HE'S JUST SAYING ALL OF YOU ARE SUSPECT SO YOU CAN'T BE USED ANYMORE. I DON'T SEE THAT PLAYING OUT THE WAY HE PLANS BUT THAT'S HIS GOAL AT LEAST TODAY, TO STONEWALL THE FBI FROM BEING INVOLVED IN ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. WE ALSO FOUND OUT EARLIER TODAY, I BELIEVE THIS WAS A CNN BREAKING NEWS STORY, THAT BACK IN DECEMBER DONALD TRUMP HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN WHERE HE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS, QUOTE, ON MY TEAM, WHICH ISN'T THE SAME THING AS ASKING FOR A LOYALTY PLEDGE, WHICH HE FAMOUSLY DID WITH JAMES COMEY, BUT IT'S IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. YEAH. ROD ROSENSTEIN SAID IN HIS TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS THAT HE HADN'T BEEN ASKED TO TAKE PART IN ANY SORT OF LOYALTY PLEDGE, SO IT APPEARS HE DIDN'T PERCEIVE IT THAT WAY EITHER, BUT FROM A GUY LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHO WE KNOW IS VERY INTERESTED IN LOYALTY, I THINK THAT'S NOT NOTHING. A COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS THERE. ON ROD ROSENSTEIN'S TESTIMONY, HE POINTEDLY REFUSED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE HAD BEEN ASKED ABOUT LOYALTY. BUT THEN WENT ON TO SAY, WELL, I DIDN'T GIVE A LOYALTY PLEDGE. SO THAT WOULD MAKE THIS STORY NOW FIT INTO THAT TESTIMONY, WHICH IS ALREADY ON THE RECORD. SO IT TURNS OUT DONALD TRUMP SAID ARE YOU ON MY TEAM, AGAIN ASKING FOR LOYALTY, AND ROSENSTEIN IN HIS INTERPRETATION DIDN'T GIVE THAT PLEDGE. HE DID SAY HE WAS ON HIS TEAM OR HE'S ON THE TEAM, I THINK HE SAID. THE REPORT SAID THAT IT WAS AN AWKWARD SITUATION, WHICH IT MOST CERTAINLY IS, BECAUSE HE'S PART OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH RUN BY DONALD TRUMP, AND HE SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE ALL PART OF THE SAME TEAM. RIGHT? I MEAN, TO GIVE THE GUY CREDIT, WHAT CAN YOU SAY IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT? PISS OFF? YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. YOU ALSO CAN'T SAY YES, I PROMISE TO BE ON "YOUR TEAM" AND NOT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S TEAM, ETC., SO TRUMP PUTS HIM IN AN UNTENABLE SPOT LIKE HE DID WITH COMEY AND SO MANY OTHERS. TRUMP AT THIS LATE DATE EITHER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN'T ASK PEOPLE AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHETHER THEY ARE ON YOUR TEAM ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE CHARGED WITH INVESTIGATING YOU, OR UNDERSTANDS THAT AND THINKS, NO, I'M FUNDAMENTALLY CORRUPT, I DON'T CARE, I DEMAND CORRUPTION FROM PEOPLE. AND BOTH ARE POSSIBLE GIVEN HIS LACK OF INTELLIGENCE AND HIS DEEP NATURE AS A CORRUPT PERSON THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOREVER AND EVER. IF YOU GO BACK TO ALL OF HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS, TRUMP UNIVERSITY, ETC. NOW ON NUNES, ONE LAST THING, MIKE QUIGLEY, A DEMOCRAT FROM ILLINOIS, SAID THAT IN A PRIVATE MEETING OF CONGRESS AND HE ASKED NUNES IF THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE WORKED WITH HIM ON THIS SECRET MEMO THAT IS SO IMPORTANT, THAT LAUNCHED THIS RELEASE THE MEMO THING, AND NUNES SAID NO, I DIDN'T WORK ON IT. WHEN HE ASKED DID YOUR STAFF WORK ON IT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, HE WAS LIKE, I'M NOT QUICK TO ANSWER THAT. AHH, I SEE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR STAFF DID WORK WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, SO THIS MEMO IS EVEN MORE USELESS. SO IT'S BASICALLY WRITTEN BY THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AND IS SEEN AS SOME SORT OF GOTCHA OF THE FBI. PREPOSTEROUS.
