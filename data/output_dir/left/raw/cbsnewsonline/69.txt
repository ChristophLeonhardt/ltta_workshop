1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,303
ARIZONA RIGHT NOW TO GOVERNOR 

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,572
DUCEY THERE WHO IS ANNOUNCING 

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,239
THE OFFICIAL REPLACEMENT FOR 

4
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,373
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN WHICH AS 

5
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,008
OUR ED O'KEEFE HAS MENTIONED IS 

6
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:09,342
JON KYL. 

7
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:13,346
>> IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT 

8
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,882
WEEK FOR OUR STATE AND OUR 

9
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:16,149
COUNTRY. 

10
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,350
JOHN McCAIN WAS AN AMERICAN 

11
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,187
HERO, AND WE WERE VERY BLESSED 

12
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,356
TO HAVE HIM AS OUR SENATOR. 

13
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:28,595
WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE SIZE OF 

14
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,029
THE VOID JOHN McCAIN LEAVES. 

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,564
OUR PRAYERS AND OUR HEART 

16
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,901
REMAIN WITH CINDY McCAIN AND 

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:39,372
THE ENTIRE McCAIN FAMILY, AND 

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,439
WE WILL CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE 

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,008
THE LIFE OF JOHN MCCAIN. 

20
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:47,213
I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING 

21
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,317
THAT WE ALL HOPED TODAY WOULD 

22
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,621
NEVER COME. 

23
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:58,992
DECISION THIS IS AND THAT THERE 

24
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,860
IS NO REPLACING SENATOR JOHN 

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,093
McCAIN. 

26
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:05,298
BUT THE LAW REQUIRES ME TO DO 

27
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,333
IT AND THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA 

28
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,402
DESERVE REPRESENTATION IN THE 

29
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:09,735
U.S. SENATE. 

30
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:14,140
IT'S A DECISION THAT I MADE 

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,008
WITH CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL 

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,341
DELIBERATION. 

33
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,011
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, I RECEIVED 

34
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:22,882
A LOT OF ADVICE FROM PEOPLE 

35
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,217
ABOUT THIS SELECTION, MOST OF 

36
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:24,950
IT UNSOLICITED. 

37
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,488
HOWEVER, THE BEST PIECE OF 

38
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,157
ADVICE THAT I RECEIVED WAS FROM 

39
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,494
ANOTHER GOVERNOR WHO SAID JUST 

40
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,965
DO THE RIGHT THING, PICK THE 

41
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,234
BEST POSSIBLE PERSON REGARDLESS 

42
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:41,734
OF POLITICS. 

43
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,938
IT WAS REALLY GOOD ADVICE AND 

44
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,840
CLARIFYING ADVICE, AND IT MADE 

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,407
MY JOB EASY. 

46
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,908
AS I CONTEMPLATED WHO COULD 

47
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,611
BEST SERVE OUR STATE IN THE 

48
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:56,816
U.S. SENATE, I KEPT COMING BACK 

49
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,652
TO ONE NAME AND ONE PERSON, JON 

50
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,386
KYL. 

51
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:05,024
THERE IS NO ONE IN ARIZONA WITH 

52
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:09,862
THE STATURE OF SENATOR JON KYL. 

53
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,497
HE'S A MAN WITHOUT COMPARABLE 

54
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:11,998
PEER. 

55
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,167
WITH NEARLY TWO DECADES 

56
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,668
EXPERIENCE IN THE SENATE 

57
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:19,305
SERVING ALONGSIDE JOHN McCAIN, 

58
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,909
SENATOR KYL IS PREPARED TO HIT 

59
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,342
THE GROUND RUNNING. 

60
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,111
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, 

61
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,513
SENATOR KYL HAS BEEN WORKING 

62
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:31,217
CLOSELY WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON 

63
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,885
THE SENATE CONFIRMATION OF 

64
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:36,289
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 

65
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,293
NOMINEE TO THE U.S. SUPREME 

66
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,695
COURT, BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

67
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:46,366
NOW SENATOR KYL CAN CAST A VOTE 

68
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,466
FOR KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION. 

69
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,269
SENATOR KYL IS A BEACON OF 

70
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,571
INTEGRITY, HIGHLY REGARDED BY 

71
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,273
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 

72
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,909
AISLE, AND ABLE TO WORK ACROSS 

73
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:57,509
PARTY LINES TO GET RESULTS. 

74
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:00,146
THERE'S A REASON HE WAS 

75
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,250
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST 

76
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,985
SENATORS IN THE COUNTRY. 

77
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,221
IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS. 

78
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,223
HE'S AN EXPERT ON THE MATTERS 

79
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:17,463
FACING ARIZONA, WATER, LAND USE 

80
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,064
AND ISSUES FACING OUR NATIVE 

81
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,165
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. I 

82
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:23,636
WANTED SOMEONE WHO COULD ENTER 

83
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,204
AND LEAD ON THOSE 

84
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:25,571
CONVERSATIONS. 

85
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,207
FOR THOSE REASONS I'VE ASKED 

86
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,608
SENATOR JON KYL TO STEP FORWARD 

87
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,978
ONCE AGAIN IN THE SPIRIT OF 

88
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,215
SERVICE TO AID OUR STATE AND 

89
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:42,655
SERVE IN THE SEAT VACATED BY 

90
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,557
ARIZONA'S MOST BELOVED ADOPTED 

91
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,325
SON, JOHN McCAIN. 

92
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,960
PEOPLE AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME 

93
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,762
THAT THIS APPOINTMENT WILL 

94
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,763
SERVE THROUGH 2020. 

95
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:55,134
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT 

96
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,670
ASSURANCE FROM SENATOR KYL YET. 

97
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,706
WHAT I HAVE GOTTEN IS A 

98
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,475
COMMITMENT TO SERVE ARIZONA 

99
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,544
THROUGH AT LEAST THIS SESSION 

100
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:08,681
OF CONGRESS, AND IT'S MY HOPE 

101
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,515
THAT HE SERVES LONGER. 

102
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,018
THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH WORK 

103
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,321
BEFORE THE SENATE, WORK THAT IS 

104
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,757
IMPORTANT AND CONSEQUENTIAL TO 

105
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,861
OUR STATE AND OUR NATION, WORK 

106
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,662
THAT DEMANDS IMMEDIATE 

107
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:22,962
ATTENTION. 

108
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,429
IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR 

109
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:28,201
NEWCOMERS, AND NOW IS NOT THE 

110
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,068
TIME FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. 

111
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:34,474
ARIZONA NEEDS SOMEONE WHO CAN 

112
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,342
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING ON DAY 

113
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:36,542
ONE. 

114
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,310
AND THAT'S JON KYL. 

115
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,378
THE FACT IS EVERY SINGLE DAY 

116
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:42,081
THAT JON KYL REPRESENTS ARIZONA 

117
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:46,252
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS 

118
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,155
A DAY WHEN OUR STATE IS BEING 

119
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:49,722
WELL SERVED. 

120
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,858
AT THE MEMORIAL HERE IN THE 

121
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,726
STATE CAPITAL LAST WEEK SENATOR 

122
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:58,264
KYL SPOKE OF HOW SENATOR McCAIN 

123
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,333
ALWAYS PUT THE INTERESTS OF 

124
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,701
ARIZONA AND AMERICA BEFORE ALL 

125
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:01,901
ELSE. 

126
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,603
SENATOR KYL HAS DONE THE SAME 

127
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,571
THROUGHOUT HIS OWN SERVICE TO 

128
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,876
OUR STATE AND NATION AND WILL 

129
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,377
DO SO AGAIN. 

130
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,480
LASTLY, I WANT TO THANK CAROL 

131
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,713
KYL. 

132
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,783
SHE'S BEEN SO KIND AND GIVING 

133
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:21,988
AND SELFLESS, AND WE SO 

134
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,756
SINCERELY APPRECIATE HER. 

135
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,223
THANK YOU, CAROL. 

136
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,525
NO QUESTION THESE ARE DIFFICULT 

137
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,827
CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR WE ARE 

138
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,630
BLESSED TO HAVE THE LEADERSHIP 

139
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:38,204
AND STATESMANSHIP OF JON KYL AS 

140
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,405
WE COME TOGETHER AND MOVE 

141
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:39,672
FORWARD. 

142
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,808
THANK YOU. 

143
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,541
>> GOOD MORNING. 

144
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,978
I AM GRATEFUL FOR GOVERNOR 

145
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,880
DUCEY'S COMPETENCE IN ME AND 

146
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,282
HONORED TO ACCEPT THIS 

147
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,516
APPOINTMENT. 

148
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,051
WE'RE ALL SADDENED BY THE 

149
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,186
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REQUIRED THE 

150
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,154
APPOINTMENT AND APPRECIATE THAT 

151
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,756
THERE WAS ONLY ONE JOHN McCAIN. 

152
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,359
JOHN AND I SERVED THE PEOPLE OF 

153
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,128
ARIZONA TOGETHER FOR NEARLY 20 

154
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,796
YEARS, AND IN THAT SPIRIT, 

155
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,098
ALONG WITH SENATOR FLAKE, I 

156
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,768
WILL DO MY BEST TO ASSURE THAT 

157
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,404
ARIZONANS CONTINUE TO BE WELL 

158
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,304
REPRESENTED IN THE U.S. SENATE. 

159
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:13,539
THE GOVERNOR ASKED ME TO SERVE 

160
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,375
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM 

161
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,511
AND HAS MADE SOME VERY 

162
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:18,978
CONVINCING POINTS. 

163
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,080
I HAVE COMMITTED TO SERVING AT 

164
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,514
LEAST THROUGH THE SECOND 

165
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:23,482
SESSION OF THE 115th CONGRESS. 

166
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,418
I DO KNOW I WILL NOT SEEK THIS 

167
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,887
SEAT IN 2020, NOR ANY OTHER 

168
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,554
OFFICE IN THE FUTURE. 

169
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,989
I'M ACCEPTING THIS APPOINTMENT 

170
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,859
TO FILL A SEAT VACATED BY THE 

171
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,760
PASSING OF MY DEAR FRIEND 

172
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,629
BECAUSE OF MY SENSE OF DUTY TO 

173
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,763
THE STATE I LOVE AND THE 

174
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:40,233
INSTITUTION OF THE SENATE IN 

175
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,135
WHICH I SERVED FOR 18 YEARS. 

176
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,371
AND BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR ASKED 

177
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,608
FOR MY HELP AND BECAUSE I'M 

178
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,343
PUTTING MY COUNTRY FIRST, JUST 

179
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:50,876
AS THIS SEAT'S PREVIOUS 

180
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,679
OCCUPANT DID EVERY SINGLE DAY 

181
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,913
FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. 

182
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,750
FOR NOW THERE IS MUCH 

183
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,653
UNFINISHED BUSINESS ON THE 

184
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,554
SENATE'S CALENDAR, INCLUDING 

185
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,521

WASHINGTON AND GETTING TO WORK. 

190
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:10,463
THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. 

191
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,832
>> WE'LL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. 

192
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:17,403
LET ME START OFF WITH THE 

193
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,604
OBVIOUS ONE, GOVERNOR, I'VE 

194
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,008
KNOWN THE GOOD SENATOR [ 

195
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,710
INAUDIBLE  ]

196
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,750
THERE WAS SOME COMMENT THAT MR.

McCAIN [ INAUDIBLE  ] ANOTHER 

198
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,185
OLD WHITE GUY. 

199
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,421
>> HOWIE, I WANTED TO PICK THE 

200
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:35,988
BEST PERSON REGARDLESS OF 

201
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:36,288
POLITICS. 

202
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,927
THERE IS BIG WORK TO BE DONE IN 

203
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:41,960
THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 

204
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,696
NO ONE IN ARIZONA HAS THE 

205
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,365
STATURE OF JON KYL. 

206
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,001
I ASKED, AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT 

207
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,334
HE ACCEPTED. 

208
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:49,902
>>REPORTER:  SENATOR, WHY 

209
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,070
COULDN'T YOU COMMIT TO SERVE 

210
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,407
PAST THE END OF THE YEAR, AND 

211
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,508
DOES YOUR LOBBYING WORK FOR A 

212
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,910
FEW YEARS NOW, DOES THAT IN ANY 

213
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,411
WAY IMPEDE YOUR ABILITY TO 

214
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:00,513
SERVE IN THE SENATE? 

215
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,781
>> THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND 

216
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,347
QUESTION IS, NO. 

217
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,983
AND THE REASON I DID NOT WANT 

218
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,320
TO COMMIT TO BE ON THE END OF 

219
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,488
THIS CONGRESSIONAL SESSION IS 

220
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,691
BECAUSE WHEN I LEFT THE SENATE 

221
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:18,431
ALMOST SIX YEARS AGO, I HAD NO 

222
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,732
INTENTION OF RETURNING. 

223
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,969
I NEEDED TO BE WITH MY FAMILY, 

224
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,205
TO COME BACK TO ARIZONA MORE 

225
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:30,843
AND TO BE AT THEIR SIDE. 

226
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,678
SO IN THAT SPIRIT I'M WILLING 

227
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,046
TO SERVE CERTAINLY THROUGH THE 

228
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,215
END OF THIS SESSION AT LEAST IN 

229
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,717
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 

230
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,784
BUSINESS THAT IS CURRENTLY

00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,583
ONGOING IS TAKEN CARE OF. 

232
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:44,256
BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A 

233
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,691
COMMITMENT AND BEYOND THAT. 

234
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,960
>>REPORTER:  GOVERNOR DUCEY, 

235
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,362
SHOULD SENATOR KYL STEP DOWN 

236
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,263
BEFORE 2020, ONE, WHO DO YOU 

237
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:52,498
THINK YOU WOULD APPOINT THEN, 

238
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,600
OR, TWO, WOULD YOU LEAVE THE 

239
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,501
SEAT OPEN UNTIL 2020? 

240
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,171
>> WELL, LIKE I'VE SAID, I'M 

241
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,573
HOPING THAT THE SENATOR WILL 

242
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,140
CONSIDER SERVING LONGER. 

243
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,810
I'LL FULFILL MY 

244
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,410
RESPONSIBILITIES AS THEY COME 

245
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:05,778
DUE. 

246
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,179
RIGHT NOW SENATOR KYL IS GOING

00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,750
TO BE HEADING TO SKY HARBOR 

248
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,317
AIRPORT TO FLY BACK TO 

249
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,618
WASHINGTON D.C. WE'RE WORKING

00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,620
WITH OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AND 

251
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,423
THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE AND

COMPLETE THE WORK OF THIS 

256

CONGRESS. 

257
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,107
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE 

258
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:35,441
] >>REPORTER:

259
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,209
>> I'VE BEEN CLEAR ON THAT FROM 

260
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:37,943
THE BEGINNING. 

261
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,545
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 

262
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,913
I AM NOT IN THE UNIVERSE OF 

263
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,747
POTENTIALS FOR THIS. 

264
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:46,452
I LOVE THE JOB THAT I HAVE, AND 

265
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,853
I WANT TO RETAIN IT. 

266
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,921
WHEN I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED 

267
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,790
ENTERING PUBLIC LIFE, I WENT 

268
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,326
AND VISITED WITH SENATOR KYL AT 

269
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,095
THE TIME AND TOLD HIM I WAS 

270
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,363
THINKING OF GETTING INVOLVED IN 

271
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:57,763
PUBLIC SERVICE. 

272
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,599
AND THE FIRST QUESTION HE ASKED 

273
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,869
ME WAS DO YOU HAVE AN EXECUTIVE 

274
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,937
PERSONALITY OR A LEGISLATIVE 

275
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,939
PERSONALITY, AND I KNEW THE 

276
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,372
ANSWER IMMEDIATELY. 

277
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:08,574
I SAID AN EXECUTIVE 

278
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:08,907
PERSONALITY. 

279
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:09,742
HE SAID THEN DON'T CONSIDER 

280
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,876
CONGRESS, AND I'M GOING TO 

281
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,510
STICK RIGHT HERE. 

282
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,079
>>REPORTER:  GOVERNOR, YOU SAID 

283
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,081
THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE THIS 

284
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:15,947
DECISION REGARDLESS OF 

285
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,149
POLITICS, BUT WITH ALL DUE 

286
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,086
RESPECT, SENATOR KYL HAS BEEN 

287
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,388
WORKING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE IN 

288
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,255
AN APPARENTLY -- INHERENTLY 

289
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,024
POLITICAL PROCESS WITH THE 

290
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:25,524
KAVANAUGH APPOINTMENT. 

291
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,060
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN 

292
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,830
SAY THIS IS A NON-POLITICIZED 

293
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,098
APPOINTMENT WHEN HE'S SOMEBODY 

294
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,199
WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THE 

295
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:33,632
POLITICAL PROCESS. 

296
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,636
>> I THINK IT IS IN PICKING THE 

297
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,370
BEST POSSIBLE PERSON, THE 

298
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,939
PERSON WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE, 

299
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,608
THAT HAS DONE THE JOB AND CAN 

300
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,744
SOOTHE THE CITIZENS IN TERMS OF 

301
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,877
WHAT THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH. 

302
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:48,648
JON KYL HAS A RECORD, HE'S 

303
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,249
WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE, AND HE 

304
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:53,252
HAS BEEN LAUDED BY BOTH SIDES 

305
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:53,619
OF THE AISLE. 

306
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,755
AND HE'S GOING TO DO A GOOD 

307

STATE OF ARIZONA. 

310
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,427
>>REPORTER:  SO YOU'RE NOT 

311
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,596
PICKING HIM JUST BECAUSE HE'S 

312
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,365
VOAGHTD FOR KAVANAUGH? 

313
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,299
>> I'M PICKING HIM BECAUSE HE'S 

314
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,534
THE BEST PERSON. 

315
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,769
>>REPORTER: [ INAUDIBLE  ]

00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,972
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE LATE 

317

SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S FAMILY, 

318
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:21,046
CLEARLY YOU HAVE GIVEN THEIR 

319
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:21,914
FEELINGS AND THEIR OPINIONS. 

320
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,782
[ INAUDIBLE  ] 

321
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,882
>> WELL, OF COURSE. 

322
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:27,920
I THINK YOU SAW LAST WEEK WAS 

323
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,256
ALL ABOUT HONORING SENATOR JOHN 

324
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,357
McCAIN, OF COMFORTING THE 

325
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,459
FAMILY AND THE CITIZENS OF 

326
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,026
ARIZONA. 

327
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,060
I DO WANT TO HOLD THOSE 

328
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,660
CONVERSATIONS IN CONFIDENCE, 

329
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,534
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE 

330
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,234
CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH 

331
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,103
CINDY THIS MORNING WAS 

332
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:44,737
INCREDIBLY POSITIVE AND I WOULD 

333
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,641
POINT YOU TO HER OWN SOCIAL 

334
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,309
MEDIA FEED AS TO HER RESPONSE 

335
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,143
TO THIS DECISION. 

336
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,878
>>REPORTER:  HOW WOULD YOU 

337
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,780
DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 

338
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,180
PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

339
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,982
>> I DON'T REALLY HAVE A 

340
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,683
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 

341
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:57,916
TRUMP. 

342
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,853
I HAVE ONLY MET HIM ON ONE 

343
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,855
OCCASION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. 

344
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:07,526
BUT IT IS MY HONOR TO BE 

345
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,695
HELPING ON THE KAVANAUGH 

346
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:09,995
NOMINATION. 

347
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,996
I BELIEVE IN JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

348
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,565
AND IN THAT CAPACITY I'VE BEEN 

349
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,833
ABLE TO SUPPORT NOT JUST JUDGE 

350
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,201
KAVANAUGH BUT THE 

351
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,936
ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK THE 

352
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,637
PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF 

353
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:18,904
JUSTICE. 

354
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,539
>>REPORTER:  SENATOR, YOU 

355
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,774
DESCRIBED HIS STYLE AS BOORISH 

356
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,576
AND AS HIS OWN WORST ENEMY. 

357
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,044
DO YOU STILL STAND BY THAT? 

358
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:25,811
>> I THINK SOMETIMES HIS DESIRE 

359
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,212
TO JUMP INTO THE MIDDLE OF A 

360
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,215
FIGHT OR MAYBE EVEN CREATE A 

361
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,284
FIGHT -- BY THE WAY, THAT 

362
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:32,851
REMINDS ME OF SOMEBODY. 

363
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,420
BUT SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE 

364
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,955
DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT HE'S TRYING 

365
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:42,962
TO ACHIEVE, AND THAT'S WHAT I 

366
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,632
SAID AND I STAND BY THAT 

367
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:46,899
COMMENT. 

368
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,167
>> WE'RE HEARING FROM NEWLY-

369
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,635
APPOINTED SENATOR JON KYL OF 

370
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,670
ARIZONA, REPLACING THE SEAT 

371
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,506
LEFT OPEN BY THE LATE JOHN 

372
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:53,772
McCAIN. 

373
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,673
I WANT TO BRING IN CHIEF 

374
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,774
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT ED 

375
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,775
O'KEEFE WHO JOINS ME NOW. 

376
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,611
ED, WE KNOW -- WE JUST HEARD 

377
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,446
FROM SENATOR KYL SAYING WHEN I 

378
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,647
LEFT THE SENATE IN PARTICULAR, 

379
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,148
I WENT INTO MORE OR LESS SAYING 

380
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:04,250
THAT HE WENT INTO LOBBYING WITH 

381
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,318
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WOULD 

382
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,153
NEVER RETURN TO THE SENATE. 

383
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:09,388
IS IT PROBLEMATIC, THOUGH, THAT 

384
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,123
HE'S BEEN HELPING -- SEEING THE 

385
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,024
CRITICISM ALREADY OF SOME FOLKS 

386
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,425
TO THE RIGHT SAYING -- TO THE 

387
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,560
LEFT SAYING HE'S BRINGING THE 

388
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,396
COURTS TO THE RIGHT, WILL THAT 

389
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,330
BE A PROBLEM FOR HIM? 

390
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,466
>>REPORTER:  WELL, LOOK, I 

391
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,801
THINK WHAT THIS ULTIMATELY 

392
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,602
PROVES NOW IS THAT DUCEY HAS 

393
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,271
BASICALLY PUT A BAND AID ON 

394
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,571
WHAT COULD BECOME A BIGGER 

395
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:26,838
PROBLEM. 

396
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,741
A FEW THINGS TO UNPACK HERE. 

397
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,908
YES, ARIZONA NOW HAS A RELIABLE 

398
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:32,178
REPUBLICAN SERVING IN THE SEAT 

399
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,111
ONCE HELD BY JOHN MCCAIN. 

400
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:34,546
AND, YES, HE WILL PROBABLY 

401
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:36,248
ALMOST CERTAINLY VOTE FOR BRETT 

402
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:36,548
KAVANAUGH. 

403
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:37,549
SO THAT CHECKS ONE BOX OF 

404
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,152
CONCERN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

405
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,353
MITCH McCONNELL UP HERE IN 

406
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:41,653
WASHINGTON. 

407
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,121
HE THEN, THOUGH, SAYS THAT HE 

408
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,591
IS ONLY COMMITTED TO SERVING TO 

409
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,226
THE END OF THE 115th CONGRESS. 

410
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,428
THAT IS BY MY MATH JANUARY 3rd 

411
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,298
OR JANUARY 4th OF NEXT YEAR 

412
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,165
WHICH COULD MEAN THAT DUCEY, 

413
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,466
SHOULD HE BE RE-ECTOMIED IN 

414
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,168
NOVEMBER OR THE GUY WHO BEATS 

415
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,305
DUCEY IN NOVEMBER WOULD HAVE TO 

416
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,007
POTENTIALLY PICK A NEW SENATOR 

417
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,175
YET AGAIN COME JANUARY. 

418
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,777
SO THIS NOW RAISES THE STAKES 

419
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,278
ARGUABLY FOR ARIZONA'S 

420
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,013
GOVERNOR'S RACE WHICH IS NOT 

421
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,782
AMONG THE MOST COMPETITIVE, BUT 

422
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,850
NOW CERTAINLY COULD DRAW MORE 

423
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,221
ATTENTION TO DUCEY AND TO HIS 

424
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:15,888
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT DAVID 

425
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,655
RIVERA INL IS THE GUY'S NAME. 

426
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,524
AND SO THIS IS NOT THE END OF 

427
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:18,791
THIS. 

428
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,392
THIS IS POTENTIALLY NOW GOING 

429
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,995
TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM GOING 

430
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,229
FORWARD SHOULD KYL DECIDE TO 

431
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:24,797
LEAVE. 

432
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,700
YOU ALSO HEARD HIM THERE SAY 

433
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,001
HE'S ONLY MET PRESIDENT TRUMP 

434
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,502
ONCE AND BASICALLY GAVE MILK 

435
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,170
TOAST ENDORSEMENT OF THE 

436
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,871
PRESIDENT SAYING THAT HE'S GOT 

437
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,772
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HIS 

438
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,240
TEMPERMENT AND DOESN'T KNOW 

439
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,708
MUCH MORE ABOUT HIM BECAUSE 

440
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,409
THEY'VE ONLY REALLY CHATTED ONE 

441
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:37,609
TIME. 

442
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,446
AND, YES, HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 

443
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,315
IN THE HEARING ROOM TODAY 

444
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,917
ALONGSIDE BRETT KAVANAUGH 

445
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,018
SERVING AS HIS SO-CALLED SHERPA 

446
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,019
OR ASSISTANT ESSENTIALLY 

447
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,220
THROUGHOUT THE CONFIRMATION 

448
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,855
PROCESS, AND NOW HE'S NOT 

449
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,088
THERE. 

450
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,423
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT HE'S 

451
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,991
PROBABLY ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING 

452
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:53,692
TO VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH. 

453
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,460
SO REPUBLICANS AT LEAST HERE IN 

454
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,262
WASHINGTON ARE GOING TO BE 

455
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:58,630
HAPPY ABOUT THIS. 

456
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,699
REMEMBER, DUCEY WAS HERE IN 

457
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,533
WASHINGTON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 

458
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,602
FOR THE MEMORIAL SERVICES HERE 

459
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,469
AT THE CAPITOL AND AT THE 

460
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:04,970
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL. 

461
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,172
THAT GAVE HIM PLENTY OF TIME TO 

462
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,208
CONSULT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, 

463
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,942
WITH LEADER MCCONNELL AND OTHER 

464
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:11,710
REPUBLICANS ABOUT THIS CHOICE. 

465
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,646
ULTIMATELY HE HAS MADE A SAFE 

466
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:15,314
CHOICE, SOMETHING THAT 

467
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,049
MAINTAINS STATUS QUO THROUGH AT 

468
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,650
LEAST JANUARY, BUT IT'LL BE 

469
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,918
INTERESTING TO SEE IF KYL 

470
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,986
COMMITS TO GOING MUCH BEYOND 

471
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:22,454
THAT. 

472
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,622
HE IS A LUCRATIVE LOBBYIST, 

473
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,790
MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW 

474
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,490
COMPARED TO THE SIX-FIGURE 

475
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,127
SALARY HE MADE FOR MORE THAN 20 

476
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:28,794
YEARS IN THE SENATE. 

477
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,329
THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE 

478
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,564
REASON HE DOESN'T WANT TO HANG 

479
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,565
OUT HERE TOO LONG. 

480
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,601
>> LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS ON 

481
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,669
TWITTER, TECH FOLKS ARE PUSHING 

482
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,405
BACK SAYING HE HAD A HUGE HAND 

483
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,706
IN FACEBOOK, LOOKING INTO 

484
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,306
ANTIBIAS ON THE RIGHT. 

485
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,541
SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO 

486
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,174
EXACTLY HOW THAT SHAKES DOWN. 

487
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:45,778
ED O'KEEFE, I WANT TO THANK YOU 

488
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,578
SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. 

489
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,880
ED, WE'RE GOING TO CHECK BACK 

490
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,248
IN WITH YOU IN A BIT. 

491
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,482
WE'LL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE 

492
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,117
KAVANAUGH HEARING AND WE WILL 

493
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,054
HAVE MORE REACTION OUT OF THE 

494
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:55,321
HEARING. 

495
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,755
>> THE NUMBER THE NATIONAL 

496
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,057
ARCHIVES RELEASED AFTER THE 

497
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,958
REVIEW, ONE REASON IS BECAUSE 

498
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,993
WE'RE ABLE TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO 

499
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:04,763
CALL OUT THE EXACT DUPERY CAT E-

500
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,199
MAILS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO -- 

501
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,700
DUPLICATE E-MAILS INSTEAD OF TO 

502
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,502
READ 13 TIMES AN E-MAIL JUDGE 

503
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,870
KAVANAUGH SENT TO 12 WHITE 

504
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,940
HOUSE COLLEAGUES, WE ONLY HAD 

505
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,708
TO READ THE E-MAIL ONCE. 

506
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,344
SECOND, THE 6% FIGURE COUNTS 

507
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:22,614
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES 

508
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,883
OF IRRELEVANT STAFF SECRETARY 

509
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,219
DOCUMENTS THAT WE NEVER EVER 

510
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:27,786
REQUESTED OR NEEDED. 

511
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,556
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE RECEIVED 

512
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,325
100% OF THE DOCUMENTS WE 

513
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,460
REQUESTED FROM JUDGE 

514
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,196
KAVANAUGH'S TIME AS AN 

515
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:37,896
EXECUTIVE BRANCH LAWYER. 

516
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,599
AND WHILE WE MAY HAVE RECEIVED 

517
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,835
99% OF JUSTICE KAGAN'S WHITE 

518
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,839
HOUSE RECORDS, WE RECEIVED ZERO 

519
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,707
RECORDS FROM HER MOST RELEVANT 

520
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,709
LEGAL SERVICE AS A SOLICITOR 

521
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,445
GENERAL, THE FEDERAL 

522
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,314
GOVERNMENT'S TOP SUPREME COURT 

523
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,449
ADVOCATE, WE RECEIVED MUCH LESS 

524
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,419
THAN 99% OF RECORDS AS A 

525
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,890
LAWYER, AND WE DIDN'T RECEIVE 

526
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,290
60,000 E-MAILS FROM JUSTICE 

527
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,795
KAGAN, SO 99% IS AN 

528
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,063
OVERESTIMATE. 

529
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,830
AND EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER 

530
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,132
RECEIVED THEM, JUSTICE KAGAN'S 

531
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:17,469
SOLICITOR GENERAL RECORDS WERE 

532
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,204
MUCH MORE NEEDED AT THE TIME 

533
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,342
BECAUSE KAGAN WAS A BLANK SLATE 

534
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,609
AS A JUDGE, INSTEAD, UNLIKE 

535
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,511
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WITH HIS 12 

536
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,346
YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE AND 

537
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,415
OVER 10,000 PAGES OF JUDICIAL 

538
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:34,953
WRITINGS ON THE NATION'S MOST 

539
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:35,987
IMPORTANT FEDERAL CIRCUIT 

540
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:39,324
COURT, JUSTICE KAGAN HAD ZERO 

541
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,594
YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE AND 

542
00:17:42,594 --> 00:00:00,000
ZERO PAGES OF JUDICIAL
