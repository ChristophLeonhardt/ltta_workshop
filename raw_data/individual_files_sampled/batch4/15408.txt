it's July 13th I'm David Menzies and you're watching battleground yeah as the title says it's ezreal events battleground but not today folks esra is on assignment we always say that in this business even if he's taking some time out but he really is on assignment so no no false advertising there listen thank you so much for tuning in even though Ezra is away the new cycle marches on and lots in the news on this really hot day in southern Ontario you know it was it's so hot right now in Toronto folks how hard is it it's so hot when I was driving into work today I saw a dog chasing a cat and they were both walking which is a segue to say that wouldn't this be a fantastic opportunity to go to a convenience store a variety store and pick up a six-pack of beer if you're gonna have a you know a barbecue but because we live in the nanny state that is Ontario we can't do that but as you know last June 7th there was regime change here in the People's Republic of Ontario and that is to say the Doug Ford Progressive Conservatives are in power and guess what according to the throne speech Doug is making good he will make good he says on a promise to put beer in the corner stores now I know for people outside of Ontario you're probably thinking how is this earth-shattering well believe it or not folks it is or shattering because Ontario is one of those few jurisdictions in the world I imagine where you cannot get beer or wine in a corner store I mean even within Canada other provinces allow that opportunity to us but we're just not adult enough which isn't really true because you know there are about 200 over 200 corner stores in Ontario that do offer beer wine and even hard liquor service these are called agency stores they're in markets that are too small to have a monopoly LCBO liquor store or a monopoly beer store so suddenly in those cases the government thinks that Ontarians are indeed mature enough to buy a beer at the corner store so that's gonna go through but what I what I notice in this Sun article about the announcement warned smokey Thomas he's the president of the interior Public Service Employees Union he predicted it will be a quote long time before consumers can buy alcohol in corner stores now to borrow a phrase from the rock just who in blue hell the smokey Thomas think he is I mean he's not the premier he's not the choice of the people he is somebody that runs a entitled public sector service Union and you know it's I find it colossal folks I know a few years ago the interior convenience stores Association they did a poll and necessarily not a poll a petition demanding beer and wine in the corner store do you know what more than half a million people actually signed that petition that was the single largest petition in the history of the province of Ontario and so we have a new government promising this we have the largest petition in the history of the province saying this and yet we have this president of a public sector union saying honoring our debt that doesn't matter it's gonna be a long time before you on a hot day like this can walk to your corner store and buy some alcohol and you know you have to wonder what the extensible policy reason is for this well it's simply this there is a innocuous thing that these government liquor monopolies go by called social responsibility which is code speak for saying that only government can possibly be entrusted with selling potentially dangerous adult stuff like liquor and yet you look at a convenience store and look at all the other adult stuff that you see there tobacco lottery tickets fireworks adult magazines well I'm told that about magazines are there I wouldn't know that for sure but anyways all that adult stuff it's OK for an aunt Aryan to buy but when it comes to a bottle of wine a six-pack of beer now we don't quite meet that benchmark and then we have this union rep saying it's going to be a long time you know I want to throw if Alex in the production team has this there was this series last year of Sue ads showing just how hard liquor control board of an Theriot employees have it and we have one okay and just what you see this folks the real story for me that breaks my heart is just hearing about people that are working alone and they're at risk and people don't realize that one of my sisters she was working alone and this person ended up having a stroke she was on the floor ceasing for about 15 minutes and just by miracle a customer came in saw her on the floor and luckily enough knew CPR and saved her life of course he called the ambulance got her to the hospital and that customer was forced to having to close the store two days later that employee ended up phoning their district manager and was more so scared they were scared that they got in trouble because they were gone for two days it broke my heart I would tell Kathleen Wynne that she needs to stop feeding us false hope about you know raising employment standards yet at the same time your crown employees are exempt from that just because this is a job that is classified as retail it doesn't devalue what we're doing for that community and it shouldn't devalue what we generate and what we give back to the Ontario taxpayers and that's the real story of what's happening with the LCpl well I don't know about you folks I think having a government job and this economy is something to be grateful for I don't know how hard done she is looks like she had about a couple of thousand dollars worth of tattoos on her body but still you have to go to the website I think it was called licky leaks a take on WikiLeaks and there is a whole series of these government employees at liquor stores just whining and whining and I guess they take it from the top I guess you know if smokey Thomas is saying that we're gonna defy the people's will the government's will in terms of bringing liquor into the the corner store then why wouldn't they have this kind of entitled attitude so anyways there's some really good ones and when I say good ones I mean unintentionally funny ones including people crying on camera now not laughing at anyone that's generally crying but I mean if your job is really that arduous maybe you should look into getting a different job look for something new if working at an LC bo is gonna make you cry every day now we I see we have a chat here from Noam miracle vote Kevin J Johnson for Mississauga Mayor well you know Evan Jay Johnson if you don't know the name Kevin J Johnson Google he's under a whole array of lawsuits for I guess shooting his mouth off and people taking this as being impolite and libelous and something that's a human rights issue but Kevin just speak his mind I know he desperately wants to unseat Bonnie Crombie unfortunately you need lots and lots and lots of money to run for a mayor of any City but I'll tell you this much I am so looking forward to the first all candidates debate in Mississauga I think Bonnie Crombie is terrified if Kevin J Johnson and he'll take her to task for sure and I like Kevin but I wouldn't bet the ranch on him becoming mayor of Mississauga and let's see if we have any and by the way folks you know please tune let me know how you feel about this kind of union protection of a decades-long government monopoly we have here something from Tammy well there you go Union protectionism get rid of LCBO and you know Tammy I agree I mean going back to the last Conservative government Mike Harris much like Rob Ford said a lot of things promised a lot of things and then started to go through with those things but one of the three key planks of the common sense revolution was indeed to privatize the LCBO so we're going back to 1995 and I think that was a golden opportunity in which to privatize the LCBO because since then what the LCBO has done and believe me folks the LCBO is a government onto itself except they're accountable to no one what they've done ever since the fear of privatization got a hold of them in the Harris years they have sunk millions and millions of dollars into what I call Taj Mahal liquor temples really what they've done is try to create a poison pill if you will try to create a series of assets that might be impossible to privatize because in a competitive system if you have a store that was I don't know six million dollars to to construct how do you compete still it should be privatized in any of those assets that are uncompetitive should just be turned into something else when you think of what you want government involved with you know policing the military do we want the government to be a retailer and a distributor of beverage alcohol and for that matter selling lottery tickets as well and marijuana as the case is going to be in the months ahead I would say no I would say that's not the role of government the role of government is to regulate and it's to tax and then you leave all the other nitty-gritty to the evil private sector I'm sure that's what smokey Thomas would call it and let's see what else we have from lunar universe what a national priority drink more alcohol legalized cannabis a great future awaiting Canada true enough you know I mean but then again it does come down to personal responsibility and that's what I find resentful about the government being in this kind of business is that they're basically saying to you and I and everyone else you're not mature so we have to be mature for you and I I don't know I coming from government I just find that personally offensive and from Jack McCloskey alright Dave we love you from Scotland we also love rebel media well you know what Jack thank you so much I am of Scottish heritage of course as you probably made out from the name I found out on my first visit to Scotland it's pronounced Mingus don't know how you get that if there's any Scotsman or Scots woman out there or Scots people as trudeau would say please try to explain to me how a surname spelt m en z IE s is pronounced Mingus I'm sure there's some kind of Gaelic silent what have you and I have just been told we have a super chat awaiting so let's go to that bear with me folks okay it's from Ezra's first irregular x' a one-pound 99 keep up the good work attend the July 14th protest well that of course would be the protest for Tommy Robinson this is a huge hot-button with our audience and I know Ezra won't be at the protest but he is gonna go to the trial I think there's some crowdfunding page up for that if anyone wants to chip in because you know and I know and Tommy knows you can't trust what the mainstream media has been a report at that trial assuming members of the mainstream media even show up they cover it but will tell you the truth and if you can go to Tommy Trial calm it's just to cover the expenses folks it's very expensive on short notice to fly to London and of course hotel prices in London are crazy and as as was mentioned on this show he's not taking any of the money that we've been raising for Tommy's legal defense that is strictly for for Tommy this is a separate thing just to help cover the expenses so if you could find it in your heart to chip in a buck or two or five or ten or more if you're in that position you would have our eternal gratitude and they'll be interesting to see indeed what happens at the that July 14th protests now let's say amandajoy they say carriage is good for your eyes but booze doubles your vision yep I can see that what's the deal with this terror threat in tea oh that's from happy infidel Fox well folks Toronto was almost done I wouldn't say shut down but there was an incredible police presence in the downtown core particularly around the Air Canada center which is called something else but I'm still going to call it the Air Canada Centre because I'm old-fashioned and the SkyDome which is also called something else but I'm not going to call it the Roger center because Roger stole that for 25 million and also up in Vaughan close to Casa men's ID Canada's Wonderland there was a big police presence of the York Regional Police there were rumors of some kind of truck or car threat we've seen these around the world nothing materialized but such as the the new normal if you want to use that term if intelligence intercepts a message and it seems that it's genuine and maybe even if it doesn't seem like it's genuine well what does law-enforcement supposed to do they have to take it seriously so there were police everywhere but you know what I did love about Toronto because I was downtown and it was the fact that everybody just went about their their lives you know they were still out and about you know going to restaurants and pubs and Ripley's Aquarium and you know we we didn't it wasn't like people vacated the downtown core and coward and terror in their basement so hey the terrorists didn't win or the would-be terrorists didn't win on this case that's for sure and let's see why we have from Luna Universe why the Canada doesn't sell more weapons it's going to be faster to make a suicide and drinking all your life well I don't think people that want a beer a cold beer on a hot day I don't think most of them are thinking about suicide Luna so we shall move on from there and see happy infidel Fox again I don't mind social drinkers neither do I privatization of the booze business is a great success in Alberta that's from real men fish yeah and Alberto led the way I think it was the late 80s I I started my career such as it is in Alberta in st. Paul Alberta in 1985 in journalism and I know back then it was government controlled liquor stores then and shortly after I moved back to Ontario that's when Alberta privatized the system there so once again I was in the wrong place at the wrong time story of my life and from Alana banana Canada I hate people that drink well you know hate is a very strong word now why do you hate people that drink please send that in now you know people do become belligerent when they drink to excess they can become belligerent but then again where would those generation Trudeau after dark segments be without those people and in many cases the reason why we do that a lot folks because we do get the sanctimonious sermon every once in a while typically from a Ryerson journalism student don't you think it's not ethical to interview drunk people no it's funny and more to the point we find that excessive alcohol often works as truth serum and yeah so that's why we're there and what we should be doing another one very shortly I should think and let's go on from Tony naggy I drink beer now and then laughing out loud Elena ok happy to hear that and what are from restitution s what are people's views on marijuana still don't know how I feel about the topic yeah I've never even had a cigarette in my life I'm not you know I guess I'm a real square you're looking at a real square right now folks someone that has never done drugs has never smoked the joint is like I said never smoked a cigarette I've never seeing the logic in filling one's lungs with smoke and polluting the area around you and I'll tell you this much although it's not fully legal doubt or at least the government stores aren't selling the the cannabis you can't go it's a downtown Swan on any given night without smelling the aftereffect of a marijuana joint and I'm not making a joke here but I think the closest thing that smells to is is a dead skunk I really do and I just you know I wouldn't have it in me to pollute the air of others around especially people on a beautiful hot summer evening trying to you know unwind at a patio and then you smell that skunk their scent but again what do I do and what do I know I'm just a square and let's see that from Alexander the fourth I get my weed delivered by Canada Post right now well you know what good for Canada Post because I don't think anyone's sending first-class letters anymore so maybe this is a way of making up for lost revenues it's a pardon part of their parcel delivery so and talk about a special delivery from Tammy again David did you ever get your rebate for your Evie and what Tammy's referring to there is my electric vehicle yes if you can imagine it took more than half a year now Ontario has a program I think it might be coming to an end with this new regime but if you buy a electric car or a plug-in hybrid and that's what I bought because the full electric cars are too expensive for my budget and of course for someone like me who would suffer from range anxiety ie you run out of all tricity your car you know becomes a paperweight yeah and there it is there's the headline material electric car rebate program canceled so Doug Ford can lower gas prices but yes I did indeed get a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion I absolutely love the car for the for the money and for the size of vehicle the mileage is off the charts and part of the reason I bought it was you get a seventy seven hundred dollar rebate for a plug-in hybrid over 14,000 for a full electric and you get the green license plate and the only tangible thing about a green license plate folks but it is quite tangible if time is money is that as a single occupant you can drive your vehicle in the HOV Lane the high occupancy Lane and on a daily commute for me that saves probably about 25 minutes each way so so do the math I mean even if I was a billionaire I'd want a vehicle with one of those green plates just Justin who drives a purely carbon spewing Ford he is forever busting my chops about embracing this little bit of green ISM because and he's just said to me I should sell it for $1,000 I don't think so but you know folks this to me is the real green part of the green movement if the government is gonna offer me money and gonna offer me a license plate to save time if it's there for the taking yeah suddenly I'm gonna embrace green ISM and I got it while it was still available and Tammy to answer your question we did a series of reports where I was simply waiting for my rebate to come through now because it's government running this program first of all if you didn't apply within 90 days you don't get your rebate so I applied in I think day four I was right out the gate with that but then one month ran into another month and I was pastoring and it took I think it was either seven or eight months before I finally got that rebate and vocht the purchaser does all the paperwork everything all the government has do is look at the VIN number stamp it and mail you a check and that took nine months incredible I mean how can you rag that puck even if you tried so so tell me thanks for asking I did get the money and I loved the car okay and we have just scrolling through some things here civil action Information Network oops noon till three both Saturday and Sunday get there early not sure what that means so let me skip ahead to a super chat which is lurking somewhere here bear with me folks I can't find it right now but out way meant it's again from Ezra's first two regulars another pound 99 ginger and haven't drank unleashed this got within you know I'd admit it was only about three years ago that I had scotch for the first time it was to calm my nerves and you know something it worked so thank you for that and thank you for your contribution of a pound 99 you can run that off to two pounds by the way that would make our things easier for our accounting I think and from Patrick Max I smoke pot from 13 - is it 25 or 35 25 and well I wish you thought you finished that thought Patrick I would like to know why you stopped smoking the pot and here we have for the run from pee dude 1911 Kendra it's all right nothing too bad to complain about our prime minister is almost as bad as Trudeau however and a far leftist just got elected mayor of Amsterdam yeah derangement syndrome is a worldwide effect that we should think and there you go so anyways those are my opinions on getting beer into the corner store and for that matter driving a green vehicle and whatever you do folks never drive your green vehicle to go to the corner store and drink in the parking lot of the corner store because then all the enemies of privatization will have a point as to why the private sector and people like me and you can't buy beer at the corner store but we are much more responsible than that what I want to move on to right now is I feel like because it's a 20-18 I'm experiencing Charlie Brown syndrome again and by way of explanation folks what I mean by that is that every four years the biggest the greatest sports event in the world we are told the world cup of soccer or football as most people call it takes place and every four years kind of let you know Charlie writing you know that ongoing gag lucy is gonna hold the football for him to kick the american football that is and of course she always Yanks it away but every four years i decide to give soccer another chance because these are the best soccer players in the world and i always say to myself this time this time it'll be different it'll be exciting it'll be fun to watch and you know what i did it again this year i tried watching some games and i got to tell you not only do I not get it but there is a profound problem that soccer refuses to address and it's this it's that continual diving and I think from a Canadian perspective where our national sports our lacrosse and hockey you can never get away with that you know in the rink and never I mean it's considered unmanned and I have two complaints one is for those players that do this their gaming the system you know they are disrespecting their sport as far as I can tell and the other thing I'd like to say is that why don't the referees call this I mean I know in hockey and I believe it's the case in soccer you can get penalized for for diving and yet how rare is that so yet again I just don't understand why the the officials the referees at soccer games put their foot down and start handing out yellow and even red cards to these divers and of course one of the most prolific divers this year was a Neymar whose were also one of the best players you know in the world who plays for Brazil and I'm one oh we could evidently we can show a picture but not a video because FIFA will come after us for some kind of trademark or copyright infringement but if my wonderful producer team can get a picture up on there's there's protests that have been happening mass diving by kids to mock Neymar and he deserves to be mocked yeah and like I said it it disrespects the sport and he should be held accountable for that and the referee should be held accountable for it for allowing to happen now what a contrast namer and if you go online you'll see well there's a picture of him I mean my goodness it looks like you know somebody from the 500 level had a sniper rifle and shot him in the ankle or something but you must see you must watch some of his diving at the World Cup this year and he's not the only one you could do a whole highlight reel but I'll leave it to you to go on the internet now I want to contrast that with a Greg Campbell who played for the Boston Bruins and this goes back to I think it was 2011 now this is a player on the book of the boss number again we can only show a picture but here's the story Greg Campbell in a playoff game they were playing the Pittsburgh Penguins actually broke his leg and the Bruins were short-handed they were killing off the penalty and if we can get a picture of that up there see there he is number 11 Greg Campbell he finished his shift he could play couldn't skate he was using his stick as essentially a crutch but he did not leave the ice he did not roll around like he had just been shot by a sniper he waited until one of his teammates ice the puck to the Pittsburgh zone and then hobbled off on a broken leg oh my god like you know stomping tom said about hockey the best game you can name just love hockey you would never see that in soccer and let's see what some of you have to say no miracle again soccer liberals using the victim card El Chapo Berra soccer's Lai I have to agree BAP comen always being enjoying your work David have a great Friday the 13th buddy yep if you're superstitious out there it is Friday the 13th more people saying yeah hockey love hockey it's funny no one is challenging me on my dismissal of the greatest game you can name and I believe we have another super chat that's come in and as you know we must read the Super chats because the super chatters are helping us pay the bills and we're not a we're not a government-funded entity folks nor would we take money from the government if we were allowed and here is the super Chett it's from tame thing one even dollar donation not an option on mine why hmm well I don't know I'll have to ask our crack team of trained broadcast professionals to look into that but I see you've offered two dollars and 79 cents and that is in dollar so we will take a look at that and there's another one that's coming folks okay from Frazer McBurney five dollars Thank You Fraser nothing beats a good company a hot sizzling steak a great brandy and a good cigar and don't put the soccer game on and then you have a perfect patio scenario and let's see Tony naggy says Croatia will win I think it's going to be France but I wouldn't put money on it and let's see what we should have here from John Zealand aren't those Democrats a bunch of screwballs when the cameras are turned on actually no they don't need the cameras turned on they're simply screw pulse by eye and really who is the face of the Democratic Party these days I mean you know is it Bernie Sanders is it Elizabeth Warren you know who I believe has 3 1 billion Cherokee heritage in her system it's sad it's almost like you're you're picking on somebody that can't fight back let's see Tony Neji again my greatest read is starting to smoke in high school yep and you know what it should be because I've never smoked but I know what the price of cigarettes are and whenever I ask a daily smoker if you could have all your money back from all the cigarettes you bought would you have enough for say a car and typically the answer is probably for three cars so not a good investment and especially that's what it's doing to your health okay then from civil action information network again less than 24 hours till Canadians for Canada rally Parliament Hill Patriot gathering two days noon till 5:00 hope you can cover it David well you know I'm hope so it'd be nice the problem with a lot of these rallies and I'm not this is not criticism for people organizing these rallies but you know when you do stand up for free speech or making a protest against any other kind of government encouraging into our lives the fact remains is that so relatively few people come out for it and the reason is I mean we have jobs we have families we have things to do we're not you know so many members of the left like an tyfa I don't think most of these people have jobs they probably live in their parents basement and they live the protest I mean it's like the George Carlin joke isn't it about dogs what does a dog do on its day off it can't sit around all day and do nothing that's its job you know so that's where the left kind of beats the the right there lack of productivity makes them ready a able and willing to attend any protest on a on a drop of a hat whereas people right-of-center we have commitments we have bills to pay we're responsible and we you know can't get involved in a lot of those protests see amandajoy I bought an electric motor bike an e-bike where's my rebate well no rebate for you I don't think it applies to those e-bikes and you know at the risk of sounding ebike phobic I think you know ebikes that's where I kind of draw the line I mean you know it's funny I think there's one thing that unites cyclists and motorists in the City of Toronto it's their mutual hatred of ebikes because ebike isn't a motorcycle an e-bike isn't a bicycle it's something in between it can't really go at such a fast rate of speed to keep up with traffic and yet it bothers a cyclist when it goes into the cycling lane so no I am sorry No mate for you and let's see Patrick Max only ladies dive in soccer you know what um I've seen some of the Canada is the men's team that is in soccer it's it's not a world power it's only been a run World Cup that was 1986 and you could have taken a bet back then and the smart money people did take this bet and that was whether Canada would score a single goal in the three-game round-robin and they did not although a lot of people held their breath I think the last game was against France and in the dying minutes the Canadian striker took a shot from close range and it hit the crossbar so that was a good bet to to take but as I understand it the Canadian women's soccer team is way up in the rankings and I remember seeing a game I think it was us in Canada might have been at the last Olympics but you know I I didn't know this as much diving in the woman's game as the man's game can any soccer fan explain that to me seems counterintuitive and modern ginger says no wacky tabacky yes that's what I called the marijuana the Matt the wacky tabacky and John Zeeland says come on people smash the like and share button I agree and rogue Jen says well you do have a fairly angular head mystic nexus I don't know what that means but I can assure you it was I was born this way as a Katy Perry are my donger somebody went saying and okay and Kendra Oppenheim says I'm a blonde girl too don't know what that's in reference to but anyways I'll admit I've know very little about soccer but if anyone can kind of I know I don't know educate me on why so many players even the good players the stars do the diving and be why the referees and the people that run world soccer tolerate this I am all ears because the diving shouldn't happen and nor should it be tolerated now moving on what do we have yes right now Trump is over in the UK and meeting with Prime Minister May and you know we got to put an end to one of the most off repeated lies out there which is this and I heard it driving in on one of the news talk radio stations in Toronto about this giant I think they they they call that an enormous Trump baby balloon well as ezra showed the other day on this very show that balloon when it's on the ground i think it measures about 15 16 feet and there's a picture of it there this is a cbc reporter she was almost i don't know orgasmic describing her love for this inflatable donald trump balloon but you can see in comparison to her how small it really is it's it's not even really the size of a bouncy castle and think of this folks once it's in the sky yeah see there's the very you know creative thing of giving him a cellphone in one of his hands but once it's in the sky just imagine what it's good it's gonna look like a speck you know I mean is that a bird is there plane is that a Donald Trump dirigible who knows but I am not against this I believe in free speech I believe in protested you know I don't agree with the balloon I don't agree with the message but it is kind of a creative way they should have made it much bigger because it's like I said it's gonna be lost on a cloudy day in London but here's the thing I really wonder if a group of people in the UK if they were going to I don't know make an inflatable to mock or protest the grooming gangs the the rape gangs you know make make use of certain characteristics in that balloon to you know criticize radical Islam in the UK first of all I don't think they'd be permitted to fly it if they did fly it I think it would be shot down and secondly I think that one of the nine hundred still can't believe that number one of the nine hundred UK cops monitoring social media looking for any potential hate crime this would be what they would go away you know so it's it's a double standard isn't it folks as it always is yeah you know what you want to make fun of Donald Trump and insult them you know have at it you know we love you know rigorous debate here all but not really with some subjects they're absolutely taboo and getting more taboo with every passing day and so there you have it and here we have we have nine hundred plus specialist officers across London dedicated to investigating all hate crime for more info please visit well for one thing I certainly shall not visit that website because I don't think I could contain myself and they probably dispatched an officer to file trumped up hate charges against yours truly the lovable one here in Toronto and let's see what else we have coming in from BAP go man David great tie reminds me of warning take you like quite safe well done sir and it was from Value Village because I am on a budget Ezra's first regulars I will be in London on the 14th the more the merrier and I hope so many more do you show up my friend and let's see Evan Sauer not enough hitting and soccer and then he adds a few lines down or fighting yeah you know the hitting is typically and when I say hitting I'm not talking like a check I mean just you know brief very limited body contact that's what usually gets the the diving and play isn't it and here's another thing I want I want soccer fans to educate me on this because what I find incredibly irritating about this game as well is when the ball goes out of bounds which is like on every second play you know the guy's got to stand there doing this to throw it back in again why not borrow from hockey and put boards around the pitch you know hit the ball off the boards you use it to make a pass use it but you know it would it would keep the game going and another thing how about bigger nets and that was actually back in 1994 I remember reading a Time magazine article they were FIFA was going to look into bigger nets to increase scoring because some of these scores I mean you know one nil doesn't get my pulse running I'm sorry folks but they were looking into it and the reason why they decided against it was that the cost for developing nations to replace all their soccer nets with bigger ones would be too egregious I would say they should have gone ahead with it anyways and increase the scoring and but I do have a plan B and what if it were am I allowed to say midgets anymore whatever come ages now little people have the goalie as a midget okay you can only be four foot tall max and you can keep the same size net that I'll tune in to see that and the boards around the I'm a soccer fan okay so let's see what else we have here folks and we have a super chat we did it just disappeared I'll try to get that back and I hear some laughing by the production team there and what are one of my one of the producers is Alex he's from Wales they have a soccer culture there I think he's gonna like giving me the head after the show I think I've really insulted him with all my ideas so I'll try to be careful and we have from our sin hello from Poland hello right back to you and we're what else do we have here I'm Kendra all of us polish are dispersed but we are all nationalists alright and Ezra's first regulars again going live after the battleground free Tommy rally updates join the open pallet panel if you can send a link I will read it out and from John Zealand Golf is fun to watch haha you know I don't think golf is fun to watch I I can never get past the four-minute mark of a golf game although there was a new phenomena for everyone that say Howard Stern fan and that is after the golfer has teed off the do-rag or cry of Baba Booey or hit him with the hein that's why I tuned in for golf now just to hear those chants I guess I'm a bit of a goof but that's the most exciting part about golf for me and Kendra writes please vote for shear you know I would say to Andrew here give us something to vote for you about I mean like I again the silence is deafening we have the ongoing grope gate this is a gift for the Conservatives in Ottawa and they really haven't made mincemeat of this issue barely a peep I don't know why maybe Mr Shearer is playing things with too much civility too much politeness I wish it was more of a street fighter folks and I think a lot of you agree with that okay and we do have a super chat coming in I believe if I can find it yes turbo Jones $2 Thank You turbo comment on the kg kjb being indicted by Muller today well you know what I don't know what the latest is on the Muller investigation there but the I think what we're gonna find is that if there's real collusion right now in u.s. politics let's look at the role the Russians had with the Democrats which doesn't get a lot of publicity for some reason I really wonder why and let's see there was a there was a good little comment here about soccer that came and went I'll try to find it for you and say forgive me folks john zealand men Zoid it's not even the size of many i don't know if you're talking about me or the trump balloon I think it's the Trump look I think it would be the size of a mini it looked like about two and a half people tall which I guess puts it in the 15-foot territory and oh here's something interesting from Special K excellent cereal there is going to be an inflatable baby Khan flying in London in a few weeks you know I really wonder about that I wonder if pardon the pun that is gonna fly or if Marik Khan is gonna deem this to be some kind of hate speech issue because again it's that double standard it's that hypocrisy folks that will make a Trump balloon a okay a balloon that attacks the left not okay I really hope that does happen and sure enough there is the photo campaign to fly Sadiq Khan baby bump in London raises 50,000 pounds now surely for 50,000 I don't know anything about the balloon business but 50,000 pounds that should get you quite a big balloon I would think and if there are any balloon experts out there please weigh in and tell us how big a balloon does 50,000 pounds get seven that's over a hundred thousand Canadian dollars I can hardly wait to see that go airborne and and what the repercussions are after it does go airborne and let's see what we have here Andrew berber sac says david does your missus ever worry when you do the after-dark show she doesn't actually I have a life insurance policy but the drunks are actually quite harmless they and when there is fisticuffs they tend to beat each other up we we just go out there and politely ask questions and the most we've received is verbal abuse and a little nudge here and there but I don't go crying about that and we have another super jet my super producer Justin has informed me for four pounds 99 from Ezra's first two regulars again keep up the good work join the panel after the show David you're welcome to join in use discord link going live after the battleground okay thank you very much every dollar counts folks and we appreciate all of your support and let's see from another coming in very fast and furious here captain chaos love Ezra but David is funnier well you know what that's the nicest thing someone has said to me all month and it's been thirteen days into the month so Kate captain chaos thank you so much for that Charles Keller hey man Zoid ever talked to adler anymore greetings from Manitoba you know what Charles Adler and I we we did a radio show we'd have me out as a Friday guest if Charles ever wants me on the show again I'm happy to do so he's a wonderful broadcaster and he has my number because I think right now we're on the don't call me we'll call you kind of relationship I might be wrong anything so Tammy again says I think all rebel journals should take a turn Hosting battleground well Tammy I guess that means I'm not doing a good job right now it might be right but I know Sheila's done this and I know John Cardillo has done this and they have been excellent and let's see Chris H writes the British Labour Party must be kept out of power at any cost Corbin is a communist and his Muslim cronies will turn Britain into a Sharia State well you know Chris in a way hasn't that already come to pass I mean I believe I might have the number wrong but not by much I think there's something like 85 Sharia Courts in the UK 85 you know where you know there's a different set of rules for certain people of a different faith I mean I just find that stunning in a Western democracy there's also I learned a UK Muslim policeman Association why would there be a need for Muslim police in the UK to have a separate Association I mean I actually find this disturbing and this is under the current government but you're right maybe under the labor it would get even worse okay is full o F care the USA has been served I'm sure you were all warned by Kennedy as to an opposing power and play mainly deep state you'll have to explain that point for me and happy infidel fox has a series of hearts and my nickname men's ID beside it that's beautiful and I hope it's not facetious though you never know there's no room for inflection or tone on a Internet chat and Tony naggy says David sing a Tommy Tommy Robinson let's hear it press what I agree with that song and I would love to sing it but I cannot sing I really can't and if I were to how many people we have online right now would just plummet to zero but as you can see folks get your Tommy ringtone at Tommy ringtone dot-com and you get the Tommy tell me tell me Tommy Robinson see I was already getting into a singing mode there and somewhere in Toronto a couple of stray dogs are howling let's see so from Copa I think this was in regard to oh I missed it I'm sorry folks from John Zealand again for a funny show Colonel Kurt would be funny and r-rated perhaps he would and so that is my feeling on the Trump balloon and so we've covered let's see beer in the corner store which we should all be in support of nobody seems against it we've covered the Trump enormous balloon which is really about the size of a small bouncy castle and we've covered I'm sorry folks why soccer sucks and like I said my goal to improving soccer basically a four-point plank eliminate diving put boards around the pitch enforce the rules and either make the Nets bigger or the goalkeepers smaller to increase scoring and then you'll have a sport worth watching and again Ezra's first irregular Azra tries accents give it a go David well what would you like dip as an accent I can't even do a Scottish accident that's pretty pathetic given my heritage now Sheila Gunn David annoy these people with some of your constant comic book references you know folks I love Sheila Gunn right I really do we really we bonded in Israel and but I got to tell you she is endlessly busting my chops about pop-culture references including yes those of comic books and by the way I read comic books is I want to keep my eye on the left because the comic book universe is being infiltrated by leftist as well but that's a totally different discussion but let me tell you something about Sheila Gunn read you know Sheila Gunn read I mean she's got it all doesn't she she's smart she's beautiful she's athletic she could kill a bison with her bare hands she showed me these pictures of her and her husband in camouflage face paint you know stalking moose and all that but you know what you know what I learned in Israel folks to use a comic book reference yeah even Superman has his kryptonite we were in a it was a tunnel going through I I guess I can't remember the the the building but it was a very narrow cramped tunnel we were told by the tour guide look if anyone has any claustrophobic issues don't go in here well about five minutes in Sheila Gunn Reed went crying like a schoolgirl like a bat out of hell out of that tunnel I couldn't believe it I really couldn't because you know she is our Wonder Woman she is our Khaleesi from Game of Thrones like how did a tunnel bring down this mighty she-warrior and then on a bus going up a mountain going up and going down the mountain whenever there was a curve folks I'm not making this up might even have video of it Sheila kind of went into the fetal position and like she was going to be sick and again I'm thinking how is this possible that this woman has probably killed with their bare hands every animal aside from those on the endangered species list that has ever existed so ever since I picked up on those picadillo Sheila is busting my chops about pop cultural references but they're going to continue Annie how someone writes in big boy blue I think the punchline there is he needed the money but big boy blue says weakling I guess he's referring to Sheila oh no she was not weak she just has a couple of phobias who and she probably wishes I never referred to them but she started it right see I'm a lot like the United States of America you know see Sheila started it with her comment about my pop cultural references you know like the u.s. you can Pearl Harbor the menzo at any time but I always dropped the ball okay Patrick Max Sheila's voice is hard to bear I disagree I think it's the voice of an angel and I've been told before I get into more trouble it's one o'clock time flies so first of all I want to apologize to Sheila Gunn read if I've revealed any secrets I shouldn't have and secondly I want to thank you all for tuning in Ezra will indeed be back on Monday and maybe he can fill us in about the out of province assignment he's on have a wonderful Friday the 13th and remember folks without risk there can be no glory good afternoon you
