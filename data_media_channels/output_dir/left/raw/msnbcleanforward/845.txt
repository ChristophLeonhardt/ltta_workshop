76
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:16,971
FIVE HOURS NEGOTIATING THIS. IS THAT WHAT THEY’RE

00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:17,371
IS THAT WHAT THEY’RE NEGOTIATING?

WE ALREADY CONVICTED YOU OF EIGHT FELONIES IN VIRGINIA.

EIGHT FELONIES IN VIRGINIA. THIS IS ACTUALLY AN EASIER CASE

86
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:28,082
THIS IS ACTUALLY AN EASIER CASE IN D.C. BECAUSE IT’S ABOUT

87
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,984
IN D.C. BECAUSE IT’S ABOUT FAILURE TO REGISTER AS A

88
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:30,351
FAILURE TO REGISTER AS A LOBBYIST.

89
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,553

JAIL FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS OR YOU CAN HELP US MAKE OUR CASE.

00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,960
YOU CAN HELP US MAKE OUR CASE. >> HE WOULDN’T GIVE HIM A BREAK

94
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:41,662
>> HE WOULDN’T GIVE HIM A BREAK ON THE SENTENCES HE’S ALREADY

00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,106
TRUMP? CAN YOU TELL FROM YOUR

102
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:52,607
CAN YOU TELL FROM YOUR REPORTING, DAVID?

103
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,375
REPORTING, DAVID? >> WELL, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

104
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:54,675
>> WELL, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF AREAS.

105
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:57,879
AREAS. I MEAN, HE MAY KNOW ABOUT STUFF

106
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,114
I MEAN, HE MAY KNOW ABOUT STUFF PRIOR TO THE CAMPAIGN, BUT

107
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,348
PRIOR TO THE CAMPAIGN, BUT DURING THE CAMPAIGN REMEMBER

108
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:14,229
DURING THE CAMPAIGN REMEMBER THIS GUY NAMED GEORGE POP -- POP

109
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,629
THIS GUY NAMED GEORGE POP -- POP PAPADOPOULOS.

110
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:15,396
PAPADOPOULOS. ONE OF THE EARLIER FILINGS IN

111
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,933
ONE OF THE EARLIER FILINGS IN THE CASE, IT SAYS THAT MANAFORT

112
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:18,733
THE CASE, IT SAYS THAT MANAFORT KNEW ABOUT THAT.

113
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:20,501
KNEW ABOUT THAT. SO MANAFORT ALSO SAT IN ON THE

114
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:22,404
SO MANAFORT ALSO SAT IN ON THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING IN WHICH

115
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,940
TRUMP TOWER MEETING IN WHICH THERE WAS IF NOT COLLUSION, AN

116
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:30,112
THERE WAS IF NOT COLLUSION, AN ATTEMPT TO COLLUDE.

117
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:32,814
ATTEMPT TO COLLUDE. THERE’S ALSO A CASE OF DONALD

118
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,716
THERE’S ALSO A CASE OF DONALD TRUMP JR. LYING PUTTING OUT A

119
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,318
TRUMP JR. LYING PUTTING OUT A STATEMENT ABOUT THAT MEETING

120
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,020
STATEMENT ABOUT THAT MEETING THAT DONALD TRUMP NOW ADMITS HE

121
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:39,454
THAT DONALD TRUMP NOW ADMITS HE DICTATED.

122
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,623
DICTATED. THIS COULD BE AN OBSTRUCTION OF

123
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:42,757
THIS COULD BE AN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE ISSUE THAT MANAFORT

124
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,625
JUSTICE ISSUE THAT MANAFORT MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT.

125
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:44,059
MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT. >> WOW.

126
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,294
>> WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS,

127
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:45,627
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, PAUL?

128
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:46,561
PAUL? THIS IS A LOT OF STUFF.

129
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:47,495
THIS IS A LOT OF STUFF. IT AFFECTS THE FAMILY.

130
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,964
IT AFFECTS THE FAMILY. IT AFFECTS THE PRESIDENT.

131
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,066
IT AFFECTS THE PRESIDENT. HE COULD INCRIMINATE THEM ALL

132
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:51,500
HE COULD INCRIMINATE THEM ALL POTENTIALLY.

133
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:51,967
POTENTIALLY. >> HE COULD.

134
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:54,469
>> HE COULD. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW

135
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:57,739
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW TRUSTWORTHY HE IS NOT AS A

136
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,073
TRUSTWORTHY HE IS NOT AS A WITNESS.

137
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:00,242
WITNESS. HE’S NEVER GOING TO SHOW UP IN A

138
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:00,576
HE’S NEVER GOING TO SHOW UP IN A COURTROOM.

139
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,610
COURTROOM. BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT INFORMATION

140
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:03,845
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT INFORMATION HE HAS, AGAIN, THE WAY IT WORKS

141
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:06,081
HE HAS, AGAIN, THE WAY IT WORKS IS HIS LAWYERS -- MANAFORT’S

142
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,683
IS HIS LAWYERS -- MANAFORT’S LAWYER MAKE A PROFFER.

143
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:09,919
LAWYER MAKE A PROFFER. HE SAYS THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD

144
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:10,385
HE SAYS THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD TELL YOU.

145
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:11,953
TELL YOU. THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD TESTIFY TO

146
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:13,689
THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD TESTIFY TO THE GRAND JURY IF YOU GIVE US A

147
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:13,989
THE GRAND JURY IF YOU GIVE US A DEAL.

148
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,624
DEAL. MUELLER EVALUATES THAT AND THEN

149
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:16,392
MUELLER EVALUATES THAT AND THEN DECIDES WHETHER THERE’S ENOUGH

150
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:19,929
DECIDES WHETHER THERE’S ENOUGH IN IT FOR HIS SIDE, FOR THE

151
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:21,196
IN IT FOR HIS SIDE, FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO GO FORWARD.

152
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:24,199
