will she rule for life China's Parliament is set to change the constitution so Xi Jinping can be president as long as he wants the reason protecting the authority of the Communist Party but will that convince anyone in China or anywhere else this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim Jim the Communist Party has governed China for decades and President Xi Jinping could become the leader serving Chinese people for years to come the two-term limit on a President's rule is about to end China's Nationals People's Congress is expected to amend the Constitution to allow the president to take the job beyond 10 years the limit was meant to ensure there was no repeat of the Mao Zedong era we will get to our guests in a moment but first Adrian Brown reports from Beijing Tiananmen Square has been the setting for some of the most defining moments in recent Chinese history not all of them peaceful now a new political drama is unfolding this carefully choreographed gathering involves almost 3,000 delegates and almost as many journalists like Parliament the media in China is controlled by the party offering uniform coverage the National People's Congress normally lasts for 10 days but this year it's being extended by 5 days possibly to give delegates more time to discuss proposed changes to China's Constitution which could mean Xi Jinping being president for life the issue is overshadowing this Congress but most delegates we spoke to didn't want to talk about it I don't want to discuss it asked them he said and no comment from him either party discipline though will ensure the amendment is passed those capable people should stay in their posts as long as possible the decision is made by the party as a delegate I fully support it the decisions made here will affect almost a fifth of humanity Premier Li Keqiang presented his annual work report with his boss seated just a few rows behind him he said the Communist Party not the country had faced an extremely complex environment both at home and abroad in his 45 page address he mentioned Xi Jingping eighteen times well me I've been touching we were rally even closer around the Party Central Committee was comrade Jim ping at his call Ojai the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics and follow the guideline Xi Jinping sought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for new era the premier presented a vision of a vibrant growing economy but in language often reminiscent of the Mao era and there was one overriding message China will be great again so long as Xi Jinping's at the helm Adrian Brown al-jazeera Beijing now we have a look at Xi Jinping's rise to power and policies Xi Jinping was born in 1953 to a communist party leader but his life took a dramatic turn when his father was purged as part of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution at age 15 she was deprived of his privileged upbringing and sent to work on a farm but he managed to join the Communist Party and worked his way up the ranks until in 2013 he was elected president of China last year his name and philosophy were added to the party Constitution since coming to power she has waged an anti-corruption campaign and launched an economic reform plan including the one belt one Road trade project he's also asserted China's territorial claims in the South China Sea she has been criticized for human rights violations and clamp downs on freedoms the People's Republic of China was established in 1949 by the ruling Communist Party here's a look at some of its leaders Mao Zedong is the founder of the Republic known as China's leader for life who stayed in office for nearly three decades until his death during his rule millions died in his Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution campaigns aimed at preserving communist ideology Deng Xiaoping was the first to rule out the leadership as a lifelong job he also spearheaded reform but is remembered for using force against pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square who Jintao Xi's predecessor didn't hold on to power long serving two terms for ten years during which China's economy grew to become the second largest in the world all right let's bring in our guests joining us in Beijing we have Victor Gao director of the China National Association of international studies in Hong Kong political scientist Joseph Chang a convener for the Alliance for true democracy and in Canterbury in the UK via Skype Kari Brown author of CEO China the rise of Xi Jinping welcome to all of you Victor I want to start with you just how significant a move is it abolishing term limits in China this is one of the most important proposed amendments to the Chinese Constitution made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and I'm sure the NPC will have this amendment adopted once it is adopted it will ensure that the incumbent President Xi Jinping will continue to serve as the Chinese president for more than two terms that is 10 years how long he will continue to serve after the originally two term limitation we do not know he may serve four years or he may serve even for another couple of decades this will help ensure the stability at the very top echelon of the Chinese leadership and I think it is a good thing for China it is a good thing for the world the reaction or the wallstreet on the immediate reaction to this announcement indicated that even the wall street was positive about the longer term stability at the very top of the Chinese leadership Joseph is there any chance at this point that this would not happen and also what are your thoughts on abolishing term limits in China I agree that the National People's Congress will definitely adopt what a party has decided but unfortunately we believe that this is a very serious step backward we may forget about Western values and Western systems in fact they have become a taboo in China in recent years this is actually a step backwards even in the eyes of the past Chinese party leadership in the early 1980s done soaping and other Chinese elderly the introduced certain principles and concepts such as limits on life tenure rejection of life tenure limit on terms emphasis on collective responsibility and so on now all these principles are being rejected and as we all know concentrating power in the hands of one person is highly highly unstable I do not see any vote of confidence from the wall street or from these stop markers all over the world I I do believe that people in China more or less accept this arrangement because they do values the ability and prosperity but at the same time we detect a lot of resentment among the Chinese intelligentsia which explains the heavy censorship of the Internet in the recent days Carrie you heard Joseph there talk about China in the 1980s under the rule of Deng Xiaoping of course in 1982 term limits were added to the Constitution how do we get to a point now that in 2018 term limits can be abolished and how exactly was Xi Jinping able to consolidate his power to such a degree at this point so the presidency is not the powerful position that's the party secretary ship and there were never any time limits on party secretaries there were unspoken age limits so the presidency is a sort of formal position of course in since the time of Jang su Ming it's been occupied by the person who happens to be most of the time the party secretary so it's part of this suite of powers along with the chairmanship of the Military Commission which we say the sort of you know the Trinity of powers at the top of the Chinese system I mean the issue really about what what's happening now is it kind of undercuts the narrative of the party institutionalizing its powers and becoming itself you know kind of an institution which is predictable and run according to well-established and understood laws and this is a sort of in a sense giving more weight to those who believe that we're looking at quite an autocratic leadership I don't think we can say autocratic leadership at the moment um because it's really establishing an intention but of course that intention won't be fully known until the presidency of the current term ends in 2023 and many many things can change since then I suppose the final thing I'd say is you know you can hold these titles when the going is good and China at the moment it's going well but the problem is when things are more difficult and historically things have become more difficult after a good period for China then everyone is going to be looking at Xi Jinping and saying well you're the one who said you have all the answers can you give us answers now it's quite an exposed position in that sense it could be quite destabilizing at the moment though yes I mean it seems to be consolidating and quite empowering Victor President Xi says that his political philosophy is going to help build a modern prosperous China of course his name and his political philosophy have been enshrined in the Constitution and the comment in the communist Constitution what exactly is that political philosophy though now I think what President Xi Jimmy means is that China need to have greater democracy and Chinese government need to have greater transparency and accountability and people's participation in government affairs and supervisors for example or as commentators etc need to be strengthened I think of the People's Republic should be for the people of the people by the people and the Communist Party of China is their representative and as far as the Parliament is concerned there is the National People's Congress the delegates are elected to the National People's Congress and they are in very important positions to legislate and to supervise the government matters and I think according to this vision the Communist Party of China need to be more disciplined they need to fight against corruption they need to weed out the corrupt elements within the party they need to be more responsible to serve the fundamental interests of the people and I think in this way the Chinese government the Chinese party will be modernized and the can be more effective in reflecting the desires of the people and to take actions to reflect the realities of the ground in China and I think this is the direction where the party here in China and the government are moving forward in the coming years and coming decades Joseph is there any effective opposition in China right now to Xi Jinping or has he been able to outmaneuver in sideline any potential threat I do not believe any particular leader or any particular faction are in a position to challenge see jumping at the moment although as Kerry also indicated because power is so much constant so concentrated in the hands of one person it may easily generate resentment among various leaders there is best interest and so on and when serious policy setback occurs people may then blame si Jin pain because he assumes responsibility for all important matters and that also explains why the Chinese leadership today is quite conscious quite aware of the danger of any financial crisis at the same time we have to understand the limits of any dictatorship in a modern system like that of China you see the party for example has been asking Cardoz of all ranks to declare the assess to declare foreign passports helped by the family members and so on and we see tremendous resistance and in fact this simple demand has not been met and you can see the effective effectiveness of the party when it goes against vested interests Kerry we're talking a lot about the politics here but how do ordinary Chinese people see the rise of Xi Jinping and do they see potential parallels between President Xi and former Chairman Mao so I mean on the perceptions of seizing ping of course it's difficult because there aren't wide opinion polls I mean it's it's sort of hard to really read but online you can see that the message of China going towards the centenary goal of being a powerful strong country in 2021 centenary of the anniversary of the Communist Party's foundation you know Chinese people want their country to be strong and have good status and Xi Jinping being the spokesperson for that message that's popular I mean he is popular because the message is popular and it's a nationalistic message but it is a message about China having its justice you know the just moment of its Renaissance after a tough you know modern history restored so they you know he is on I think secure ground for most people though it will not help that they have a perpetual president if their living standards are impacted this is not the time of Mao Zedong Mao Zedong was a almost autonomous from the Communist Party he was able in the culture revolution to attack the Communist Party rather strangely 50 years ago well Xi Jingping is the servant of the party and is sort of fitting into the party structures even if he's in some ways sort of molding them to his own political programme that's got to fit within the party philosophy and for most people they will be worried about the issues of you know kind of a good quality growth a good quality living environment a good quality you know kind of jobs for the children that they are spending a lot of money on educating these bread and butter issues are the same in China's they are everywhere and if failure to really address those because China does have huge kind of challenges and will be very very serious we shouldn't be complacent about the condition of China we see a confident strong leadership now and that's good because the world has got enough instability in it this is you know kind of at the moment looks stable but China's significant issues in terms of its economic structure its environment it's kind of even inequalities these are have not gone away and making a president perpetual is not gonna make them go away in fact may well make people say well you look so powerful why can't you solve these problems that's not happening now but it could happen in the future victory critics of xi Jinping charged that his anti-corruption drives really has been just a way for him to consolidate more power how do you respond to that I think a corruption in China is deeply entrenched and it's permeated into all corners of the system within the party within the government and if fight against corruption is not relentless the Communist Party of China will collapse and the People's Republic of China as we know it may collapse that's why fighting against corruption is absolutely about the life and the death of the party and the People's Republic and I think President Xi Jimmy has won tremendous amount of support and trust from the party members and from the people in general for his relentlessness in fighting against the corruption not only weeding out corrupt officials but also come up with more systematic arrangement to ensure that corruption will not be repeated again in the future and once it is repeated it will be detected in timely way and will be punished accordingly and I don't think using corruption fighting against the corruption as a tool to promote his own agenda is the point I think the reason the fundamental reason why this time this constitutional amendment to abolish the two-term limitation on the presidency has been made and most likely will be adopted truly reflects the tremendous amount of goodwill and support among the party members among the people for what effective an outstanding leader President Xi Jinping has demonstrated himself and also if you compare him with his peers in other countries on the global stage I don't think it is difficult to reach the conclusion that President Xi Jinping is generally ranked as one most effective and outstanding global leaders for his commitment to free trade for his commitment to globalization for his initiation or the one belt one Road initiative for his very effective way of organizing the establishment of the Asian infrastructure investment bank for example and for his continued to push for China to become more integrated with the rest of the world the record speaks for itself so the rest of the world should not be dispersor prized that Xi Jinping is expected to serve longer than 10 years Joseph how concerning is all of this to the asia-pacific region specifically well I do believe that most Asian Pacific countries now see China as a very important economic partner but even Chinese leaders and especially Chinese think tanks admit that a lot of Asian countries while they side with China in the economic matters they are also quite eager to use the United States as a military balance against Chinese influence so they are adopting all types of hedging strategies the service China and certainly there is a lot of interest in the one belt one road initiatives and the entire and China's eagerness to to achieve in these projects to conclude projects may well be seen as a weakness and and has been exploited by governments and it is quite obvious that very often change of governments would also mean termination of contracts renegotiation of contracts and so on and it has been reported that almost up to one-third of the contracts concluded within the framework of these one belt one road initiatives have already been cancelled and we negotiations and abandonment have been very costly carry the us seize China's failing at reigning in North Korea are there particular areas where President Xi's leadership have been at fault well I mean I think that the president she'd like his predecessors who Jintao and Johnson being have really wanted to maintain the status quo because there's no easy outcome at the moment North Korea has nuclear iced and all of the kind of scenarios of the unified Peninsula probably and us kind of influence or a kind of collapse State with all of the issues that that would give rise to for China means in a sense it's it's stuck really trying to just preserve what's kind of you know the condition at the moment which is an instability but manageable since the Olympics in South Korea last month North Korea has made some you know kind of more placket real kind of language and and seems to be reaching out and I think China's supportive of that what we've really seen though is a China with an issue where it really has a kind of big big stake it has a treaty Alliance after all from 1961 with North Korea of you know mutual defense you know it seems to be often incapable of really sounding and acting as as big as maybe we expect it to I think under Trump we've also seen you know a lot of instability so China has had to kind of maybe respond in a very different way I think it isn't likely that China's going to want to sort of have a very radical resolution to this issue which means that it's going to be dealing with a lot of unpredictability it's going to continue preserving the status quo whether that means that the region Kim Jungman will be coming to Beijing or even that Xi Jinping as he hasn't so far will go to Pyongyang you know that's something that we can kind of watch with great interest but at the moment it is preserving the status quo Victor does all this push China now towards a more authoritarian and militarized leadership no I don't think so I think China has reached such a level of development more and more people are in the middle class more and more people are better educated and every year more than 100 million people travel abroad to see all parts of the world so they're becoming more and more sophisticated of course they want to have stability they want to have continued improvement of their living standards want to be increasingly part of the world and this is exactly what the Chinese government is trying best to do that this is also why President Xi Jinping has been relentless over the past five years to do his best is travel to everywhere in China is meeting with people of all walks of life in China's promoting this grand national dream the Chinese dream for example the final revitalization of China and China becoming part of the world and the common destiny of mankind and I think this does not mean that China will ever tolerate another authoritarian or totalitarian ruler we need to have more transparency more accountability more openness I'm sorry to cut you off just that we're almost out of time and I want to get one more question in to Joseph Joseph how does all this affect the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and very quickly please because we're almost out of time we see this as an indication that Beijing will continuous hot line policy to us Hong Kong there's no tolerance of the pro-democracy movement and it is feeling rather uncomfortable about Hong Kong because Hong Kong happens to be the major source of criticisms against the Chinese party regime alright gentlemen we're gonna have to leave it there thanks to all our guests Victor Gao Joseph Cheng and Kerry Brown and thank you too for
