Fox News has been obsessed with this migrant caravan had heading for the United States and one of the individuals who has used this as an opportunity to drum up support and excitement in his base right before the midterm elections is Donald Trump so Donald Trump is claiming that he will cut off foreign aid to the countries that these migrants are coming from Guatemala happens to be one of them so he shared this opinion or what he plans on doing in a series of tweets and in these tweets Trump escalated his rhetoric surrounding the group of immigrants or migrants declaring a national emergency as they approached the border and claiming that unknown Middle Easterners had joined the group okay so let's talk about this notion that there are Middle Easterners like terrorists that have like co-opted an effort to get migrants to the United States to seek amnesty so here's what he said Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the United States we will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them he also says every time you see our Caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remember the midterms so unfair to those who come in Legally now I know I don't need to remind you guys but Republicans control Congress right now the executive branch of course is controlled by a Republican Donald Trump Democrats have no power and I assure you that if Republican members of Congress wanted to do something to reform our immigration Democrats would probably sign on so Trump blaming Democrats for this is ridiculous but moving forward here's where he starts talking about middle easterners he says sadly it looks like Mexico's people and military on are unable to stop the caravan headed or heading to the southern border of the United States criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in I have alerted Border Patrol and military that this is a national emergency as a border patrol and the military didn't know and he says that we must change the laws so where did he get this insane idea from well we all know that he loves to watch Fox News and he's essentially regurgitating nonsense that Peter hex had said on Fox and Friends let's hear his comments oh you got there you got the president of Guatemala saying to a local newspaper down there just oh just last week they caught over a hundred Isis fighters in Guatemala trying to you could reuse this Caravan or other process you talked to their local newspaper we don't know it hasn't been verified but even one Isis even one poison pill is too many in a caravan okay just to be clear the leader of Guatemala did not say members of Isis had somehow decided to hitch a ride on this Caravan and more importantly we have reports ABC's team in southern Mexico has encountered no Middle Easterners amid the group and that's again according to reporting from ABC so I mean this is this is a double fold um so this is obviously about the elections he even says it in a tweet you're not supposed to say it in the tweet you're not so you're supposed to say you're actually outraged about this but he's trying to get his voters all riled up so that's part one and then when we secondly we have to call out the several lies that he has and they're like the middle-eastern their lives preposterous but when you call out the lie that that is a two-fold advantage to them they believe or give the Trump team believes number one is well if they start a conversation about whether there were terrorists in the caravan they win either way because even when we rebut it we have to repeat the absurd claim and all you hear this is absurd claimant remember a lot of the voters don't watch all of the details or read all the details they just see the headlines Middle Easterners in the caravan terrorists in the camera no terrorists in the camera but they see terrorists in a caravan right and then secondly when we say he's a liar because he's an obvious liar the Republican voters get triggered by that because they their precious little snowflakes that's the one thing that drives them the most crazy dear leader we must go out and protect him let's go vote so that's why they're doing this now on the substance of the caravan real quick the substance of it yeah so cold substance yeah the caravan is not going to bust through our gate and come into the country it's not Mad Max okay they are if they're not sneaking in there in a giant Caravan okay the caravan goes to a port where they then apply for asylum that's what's happening and so if you were terrorists you don't attach yourself to a giant caravan that's on national television or international television and then apply for asylum you sneak it Glen back two or three years ago said on his show that Isis has a camp in Mexico a training camp in Mexico totally made up and I like how these guys don't even think about basic things like the language barrier for example like somehow Mexicans and you know whatever people from Saudi Arabia or whatever just chatting it up and also most important point this is nothing but an elitist trick what they're trying to do is get middle class white people to be scared and afraid and blame poor black and brown people for their problems so the rich people run out the back door with all the money that's right my favorite was a conservative outlet or a bunch of them actually said we found an Isis flag at the border it turned out it was a soccer jersey look in the postgame I want to give you more fun facts yeah Trump said that this was a gigantic amount of money that these three countries are receiving I'm gonna tell you the reality especially compared to Egypt and Israel how much funding
