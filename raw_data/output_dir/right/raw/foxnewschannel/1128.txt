1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,189
>> Neil: YOU KNOW, MIGHT NOT BE

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,324
ONE AND DONE IN SINGAPORE, THAT

3
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:17,261
THE SO-CALLED ONE-DAY MEETING

4
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:18,763
MIGHT EXTEND THERE DOWN THE ROAD

5
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:21,999
AND THAT THE TALK THAT THEY'RE

6
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:26,404
PROMISING COULD YIELD SORT OF A

7
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:30,374
DURATION OF THE LIKES OF RONALD

8
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:32,710
REAGAN AND MIKAEL GORBACHEV.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,946
THAT WAS THEN, WHAT WILL HAPPEN

10
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:35,213
NOW?

11
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:36,547
THE READ FROM KENTUCKY SENATOR

12
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:36,981
RAND PAUL.

13
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:38,149
WHAT HE MAKES OF THIS.

14
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:39,984
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

15
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:41,786
PROSPECT, SENATOR, THAT THIS

16
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:43,521
COULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD

17
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,989
STRETCH OUT A LITTLE BIT?

18
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,325
>> YOU KNOW, I'M STILL VERY

19
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:47,658
HOPEFUL.

20
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:50,428
I'M BACK -- GLAD WE'RE BACK ON

21
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:53,297
AGAIN WITH THE KOREAN SUMMIT.

22
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:54,665
I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASY

23
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:55,933
SOLUTION BUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE

24
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,769
HAVING A DISCUSSION AND

25
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:01,806
BEGINNINGS OF DIPLOMACY IS A

26
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:02,206
GOOD THING.

27
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:03,841
>> Neil: SO IT'S TRADE BACK AND

28
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:05,376
FORTH WITH THE CHINESE AND NOW

29
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:07,345
WITH THE ALLIES, THE CANADIANS

30
00:01:07,345 --> 00:01:09,614
ARE UPSET, FRENCH, GERMANS.

31
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:10,648
EVERYBODY SEEMS UNSET.

32
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:13,751
DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE TIME TO

33
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:16,988
BE RUFFLING THEIR FEATHERS WHILE

34
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:18,556
WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING FAR

35
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:20,158
BIGGER FOR THE TIME BEING?

36
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:21,325
>> NO.

37
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:25,730
I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO USE

38
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,867
NATIONAL SECURITY WAIVERS TO

39
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:31,969
INVOKE ON OUR FRIENDS.

40
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,705
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE

41
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:36,007
MISINTERPRET, THEY TALK ABOUT

42
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,542
THE TRADE DEFICIT AS MONEY THAT

43
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:38,609
WE'VE LOST.

44
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,545
EVERYBODY HAS A DEFICIT WITH

45
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,046
PEOPLE THAT THEY BUY STUFF FROM.

46
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:44,949
I HAVE A DEFICIT WITH MY GROCERY

47
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:45,249
STORE.

48
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:47,752
TEXAS MAY HAVE A DEFICIT WITH

49
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:48,753
OKLAHOMA.

50
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:51,222
BUT IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL

51
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:51,622
MEASUREMENT.

52
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:53,291
DOESN'T MEASURE PROSPERITY.

53
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,325
YOU WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE

54
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:55,927
COUNTRY HAS MORE TRADE OR LESS

55
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:58,162
AND IF YOUR ECONOMY IS GROWING

56
00:01:58,162 --> 00:02:02,300
AND IN MORE PEOPLE HAVE JOBS.

57
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,634
>> Neil: SO YOUR COLLEAGUE,

58
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:04,635
SENATOR CORKER IS AMONG THOSE

59
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:07,905
AND OTHERS, MAYBE YOU ARE, TOO,

60
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:11,576
THAT THINKS THAT THIS SHOULD GET

61
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:15,646
A SENATE YEA OR NAY WHEN WE'RE

62
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,582
LOOKING AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

63
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:17,882
DOING.

64
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:20,351
>> I'M ALWAYS A BELIEVER IN

65
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,587
CONGRESS RECOUPING ITS POWER,

66
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:23,921
TAKING ITS POWER BACK.

67
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:26,390
WE HAVE ABDICATED SO MUCH POWER

68
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,959
AND GIVEN IT UP TO THE

69
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,393
PRESIDENCY, WHETHER IT'S

70
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:30,595
WAR-MAKING OR HEALTHCARE

71
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,263
ECONOMY, REGULATIONS IN ANY

72
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:32,630
INDUSTRY.

73
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,131
WE HAVE GIVEN UP TOO MUCH POWER

74
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:35,066
TO THE PRESIDENT.

75
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:38,336
I'M ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF TRYING TO

76
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:39,937
GET THAT POWER BACK.

77
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:41,505
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK THE

78
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:42,840
PRESIDENT IS STARTING A BAD

79
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,808
PRECEDENT HERE?

80
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:44,942
HE HAS BROUGHT SOME PEOPLE

81
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,811
IRANIAN ACCESS TENSION THAT THE

82
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,145
CHINESE AND MANY FRIENDS HAVE

83
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:50,214
RIGGED THE SYSTEM TO THEIR

84
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:50,815
BENEFIT?

85
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:52,450
IS THIS THE PROPER RESPONSE?

86
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,217
IS HE GOING TOO FAR?

87
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:55,386
>> YOU LOOK AT THE OLD TRADE

88
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:57,121
DEALS FROM DECADES AGO AND THEY

89
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:59,290
HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY WAIVER

90
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,824
IN THEM.

91
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:02,093
THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE OKAY.

92
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:05,630
TOMORROW WE DECLARED WAR, 1941

93
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,330
WITH JAPAN.

94
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,268
SHOULD WE NOW REASSESS OUR TRADE

95
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:11,936
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

96
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:13,571
IT WASN'T ABOUT USING IT AS AN

97
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:15,039
EXCUSE TO PUT TARIFFS ON

98
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,373
ANYBODY.

99
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:16,807
IT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE THREAT

100
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:18,709
OF WAR OR THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES

101
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,311
OF WAR, TO NOT TRADE WITH AN

102
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:20,811
ENEMY.

103
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:23,414
SO IT'S A MISAPPROPRIATION AND A

104
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:26,484
MISUSE OF LANGUAGE FROM A LONG

105
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:28,319
TIME AGO AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

106
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,653
HELPFUL.

107
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:30,721
I HAVE FARMERS IN MY STATE.

108
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,723
EVERY FARMER IS AGAINST A TRADE

109
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:32,990
WAR.

110
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,993
I HAVE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY.

111
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:38,929
20,000 PEOPLE WORK FOR TOYOTA.

112
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:43,134
WE EXPORT BOURBON IN OUR -- IN

113
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,168
KENTUCKY AS WELL.

114
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:45,036
AGAINST A TRADE WAR.

115
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,704
SO KENTUCKY BENEFITS FROM TRADE.

116
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:50,074
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE LESS TRADE.

117
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,609
WE WANT MORE TRADE.

118
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,144
>> Neil: AHEAD OF THE NORTH

119
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:57,081
KOREAN MEETING, SENATOR, THERE'S

120
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:58,649
TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD GRANT

121
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:01,285
OR OFFER TO THE NORTH KOREANS TO

122
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:03,354
GET THEM TO DENUCLEARIZE.

123
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:07,291
ONE OF THE IDEAS, IN ADDRESSING

124
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:12,730
THE NUMBER OF TROOPS OF 50,000

125
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,965
IN KOREA.

126
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:15,933
YOU'VE BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN

127
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,269
OPPONENT OF OUR COMMITMENT

128
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,036
AROUND THE WORLD.

129
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,438
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

130
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:22,606
>> ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO, THERE

131
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,342
WAS AN OP-ED THAT I WROTE THAT

132
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,511
PERHAPS THE FORCES OF THE DMZ

133
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,013
COULD BECOME MORE INTERNATIONAL

134
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:29,814
AND CHINA COULD BE PART OF THAT.

135
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,183
THERE'S A DISTRUST ON NORTH

136
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:35,252
KOREAN'S PART AFTER LIBYA, THE

137
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,721
IRAN AGREEMENT A LOT OF

138
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:37,088
DISTRUST.

139
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:38,723
IF YOU CAN GET AN INTERNATIONAL

140
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:41,258
FORCE THERE IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM

141
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:44,128
GIVING UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS

142
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:45,996
PROGRAM, IT WOULD BE WORTH

143
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:46,297
WHILE.

144
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:48,032
I WOULDN'T JUST GIVE IT AWAY.

145
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,767
WE WOULD BE WILLING TO WITHDRAW

146
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:54,071
TROOPS IF THERE'S A

147
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:54,772
DENUCLEARIZATION AND AN ENTER

148
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,474
NATIONAL FORCE THAT WOULD

149
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:58,709
REPLACE OUR FORCES.

150
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,211
>> Neil: WHAT DID YOU MEAN OF

151
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:01,912
USE OF FORCE WITHOUT APPROVAL OF

152
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:05,349
CONGRESS OR ONGOING MILITARY

153
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:06,183
ACTIONS WITHOUT ANY CHECKING?

154
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:08,119
>> YOU'RE TALKING ACTED OUR

155
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:08,652
HEARING TODAY?

156
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:09,120
>> Neil: YES.

157
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,023
>> WE HAD A HEARING TODAY

158
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,693
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN AT WAR WITH

159
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:16,093
AFGHANISTAN.

160
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:17,728
WHILE I WAS IN FAVOR OF THE

161
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:19,230
ORIGINAL USE OF FORCE, I'M NOT

162
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,332
IN FAVOR OF AN UNLIMITED THREE

163
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:24,301
SITUATION TO BE AT WAR FOREVER.

164
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:25,770
WE'RE AT WAR OF EIGHT DIFFERENT

165
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,538
GROUP AND 20 COUNTRIES.

166
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,107
WE HAD SOLDIERS DIE IN MALI THE

167
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:30,908
OTHER DAY.

168
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:32,710
MANY PEOPLE CAN'T FIND MALI ON

169
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,211
THE MAP AND HAVE NO IDEA WHY

170
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:34,745
WE'RE THERE.

171
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:35,880
WE SHOULD BE DEBATING.

172
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,352
IT'S CONGRESS'S ROLE.

173
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:46,390
IT'S CONGRESS' ROLE OF DEBATING

174
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,690
THAT.

175
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,125
>> Neil: SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

176
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,361
IF SOMETHING WERE TO ACT UP, THE

177
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,530
SYRIANS USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS,

178
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,531
WHAT WOULD BE SENATOR RAND

179
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:55,065
PAUL'S POSITION WOULD BE?

180
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:57,468
>> THE WAR POWER'S ACT AND

181
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,570
PEOPLE OVER TIME HAVE COME TO

182
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,374
BELIEVE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

183
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:05,543
THE PRESIDENT CAN REPEL IMMINENT

184
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:05,910
INVASION.

185
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,011
IF WE BELIEVE SOMEONE IS IN THE

186
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,145
PROCESS OF LAUNCHES A WEAPON

187
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,647
AGAINST US, YES, THE PRESIDENT

188
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,148
CAN ACT IMMINENTLY.

189
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:16,954
WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED ON PEARL

190
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:19,089
HARBOR, IT TOOK 24 HOURS AND

191
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,560
CONGRESS ACTED UNANIMOUSLY.

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,029
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW UP

193
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:30,334
CHEMICAL MUNITIONS, YOU HAVE TO

194
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:31,068
ASK FOR CONGRESS.

195
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,570
YOU'LL FIND A DEBATE ABOUT IT

196
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,171
AND WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

197
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:36,073
DECIDED THAT THAT WAS THE BEST

198
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:37,608
APPROPRIATE ACTION.

199
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:38,809
>> Neil: AS WEIGHTY AS IMPORTANT

200
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,244
THOSE REMARKS ARE AND THAT LINE

201
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:42,646
OF THINKING IS, I'M SURE YOU'RE

202
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:45,115
AWARE IT WAS YOUR TWEET ON BILL

203
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,650
CLINTON AND COMMENTS ABOUT

204
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,053
MONICA LEWINSKY THAT GOT FAR

205
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,020
MORE PLAY.

206
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,988
THAT'S THE WAY.

207
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,324
HE EPITOMIZES THE AGGRESSOR, NOT

208
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:54,058
THE VICTIM.

209
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:56,160
YOU CAN'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATE OR

210
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,295
CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AN

211
00:06:58,295 --> 00:06:58,629
INTERN.

212
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,097
DID YOU EXPECT IT WOULD GET AS

213
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,332
MUCH BUZZ AND PLAY?

214
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:03,334
>> I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT I

215
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:07,071
DON'T THINK HE'S TRULY CONTRITE.

216
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:07,538
VICTIM.

217
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,073
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW

218
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,242
ANYBODY WOULD HAVE THE AUDACITY,

219
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:14,478
BILL CLINTON, TO ASK HIM ABOUT

220
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:14,945
THIS.

221
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,548
TWO DECADES THE MAIN STREET

222
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:19,216
MEDIA COVERED UP FOR HIM.

223
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:22,019
HE SAID IT WAS CONSENSUAL AFFAIR

224
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,053
BETWEEN ADULTS.

225
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:24,088
TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT THIS.

226
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:25,890
MOST WOMEN FROM THE ME TOO

227
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,291
MOVEMENT SAYS A 20-YEAR-OLD IS

228
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,593
NOT REALLY CAPABLE OF GIVING

229
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:30,728
CONSENT IN THE WORKPLACE TO HAVE

230
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:31,662
SEX UNDER THE DESK.

231
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,197
IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT, THAT

232
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:36,300
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE IN

233
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,870
1998 IF YOU WERE THE CEO OF ANY

234
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,337
MAJOR COMPANY.

235
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,572
NOBODY WOULD THOUGHT THAT WAS

236
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:43,007
ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR AND HE STILL

237
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:44,174
DOESN'T GET IT.

238
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:46,310
HE SAYS OH, I WAS -- I WAS IN

239
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,445
DEBT AND -- BEFORE I MADE MY

240
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:51,248
NEXT $100 MILLION, I WAS IN A

241
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:52,550
FEW MONTHS IN DEBT.

242
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,685
SO YOU KNOW --

243
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,153
>> Neil: I WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE

244
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:58,055
PRESIDENT CLINTON ALSO TALKED

245
00:07:58,055 --> 00:07:59,790
ABOUT THIS NOTION WHETHER A

246
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,624
PRESIDENT CAN PARDON HIMSELF.

247
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:01,258
HE SAID NO.

248
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:02,493
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS

249
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:03,994
PRESIDENT, TALKING ABOUT THAT

250
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,095
VERY SUBJECT, CAN?

251
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:07,264
HE THINKS HE CAN.

252
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,366
>> THE CONSTITUTION SEEMS TO PUT

253
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,302
NO LIMITS ON THE PRESIDENT.

254
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:12,636
THERE'S SOME PRINCIPLES OF LAW

255
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,572
WHERE PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT IT

256
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,073
DEFIES SORT OF THE IDEAS OF

257
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:17,374
JUSTICE FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE

258
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,343
TO PARDON THEMSELVES.

259
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:20,711
BUT THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T

260
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,012
EXPLICIT IN PROHIBITING THIS.

261
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,915
SO YES, HE CAN PROBABLY DO IT.

262
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:26,450
BUT YOU NOTICE THE PRESIDENT

263
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,152
SAID THIS, HE SAYS HE'S GUILTY

264
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:29,687
OF NOTHING AND HE'S NOT GOING TO

265
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:30,254
DO THAT.

266
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:31,655
BUT I THINK THAT --

267
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:33,791
>> Neil: WHY MENTION IT,

268
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,124
SENATOR?

269
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:35,893
>> I THINK BECAUSE WHAT HAS

270
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:37,727
HAPPENED IS THIS WHOLE

271
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:38,895
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA HAS

272
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,931
BECOME SO POLITICIZED, YOU

273
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:41,265
WONDER.

274
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:43,033
SO THEY HAVE INFORMANTS IN

275
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,268
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.

276
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:50,674
DID THEY PUT INFORMANT IN

277
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,844
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN.

278
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,246
SHE WAS TRYING TO DIG UP STUFF

279
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:57,114
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP.

280
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:58,949
SO SOUNDS LIKE, YOU KNOW, DO WHY

281
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,251
WANT THE FBI AND THE CIA, DO WE

282
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:03,053
WANT THEM INVOLVED IN

283
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:03,654
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS?

284
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:04,855
SHOULD THERE BE SORT OF A HANDS

285
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:05,356
OFF ON THIS?

286
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:06,890
I THINK IT'S UNSEEMLY THAT THE

287
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,159
FBI WAS PUTTING INFORMANTS IN

288
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,894
THERE, TRYING TO EXTRACT AND

289
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:16,033
ENTRAP MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP

290
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,400
CAMPAIGN.

291
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,669
IT'S INCREDIBLY INAPPROPRIATE.

292
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:23,540
>> Neil: THE PRESIDENT CALLED IT

293
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,241
SPYGATE.

294
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,877
>> HE WORKED FOR THE FBI FOR

295
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:27,811
SEVERAL DECADES.

296
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:29,046
HE'S PAYING PEOPLE MONEY TO GET

297
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:31,148
THEM TO LONDON.

298
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,751
THERE'S SOME THAT SAY THERE'S A

299
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:34,918
WHOLE RUNNING INTO THE

300
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:36,754
AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR OR DEPUTY

301
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:37,888
AMBASSADOR OVER DRINKS WITH ONE

302
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:39,556
OF THE TRUMP OFFICIALS WAS NOT

303
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:41,492
SORT OF A RANDOM EVENT, THAT

304
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:42,793
MAYBE THAT HAD BEEN PLANNED.

305
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,728
SO YES, THAT'S ENTRAPMENT AND

306
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:45,796
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT

307
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,298
SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED WITH.

308
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:49,900
THERE'S STILL EVIDENCE AND JUDGE

309
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,668
ANDREW NAPOLITANO TALKED ABOUT

310
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,136
THIS THAT THE BRITISH WERE

311
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:53,771
GIVING INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO

312
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:54,838
JOHN BRENNAN.

313
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:57,808
I ASKED GINA HASPEL ABOUT THIS.

314
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:00,477
SHE SAYS THAT SHE CATEGORICALLY

315
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:03,213
DENIES THAT SHE KNOWS ANYTHING

316
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,416
ABOUT THE BRITISH GIVING

317
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,351
INFORMATION TO JOHN BRENNAN.

318
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,119
SO THE NEXT SHOULD BE TO JOHN

319
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,453
BRENNAN.

320
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:10,854
ARE YOU GIVING INFORMATION TO

321
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:11,321
THEM?

322
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:12,856
THAT'S ILLEGAL.

323
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:13,857
NOW HE'S THIS BIG TALKING HEAD

324
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:15,492
SPEWING HATRED FOR PRESIDENT

325
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:15,793
TRUMP.

326
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,094
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S COME OUT OF THE

327
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:21,131
CLOSET AS A PARTISAN.

328
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:24,268
MAYBE HE NEEDS TO BE ASKED UNDER

329
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:25,869
OATH, DID YOU RECEIVE

330
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:27,705
INFORMATION, SECRET INFORMATION,

331
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,239
ILLEGAL GOTTEN BY THE BRITISH

332
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:30,541
GOVERNMENT, DID YOU RECEIVE THIS

333
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,876
INFORMATION ON PRESIDENT TRUMP

334
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:35,112
OR HIS CAMPAIGN?

335
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,714
ASK BRENNAN THAT UNDER OATH AND

336
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:37,981
SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

337
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:41,251
>> Neil: BACK TO BILL CLINTON.

338
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,720
HE SAID IF THIS WERE DEMOCRATS,

339
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,455
THE IMPEACHMENTS WOULD BE

340
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:44,822
STARTING.

341
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,056
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

342
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:47,491
>> WE GO TOO CRAZY ON BOTH

343
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:48,158
SIDES.

344
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,394
I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT THE

345
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:51,161
SPECIAL PROSECUTORS HAVE TOO

346
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:52,096
MUCH POWER.

347
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:53,230
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE ENTIRE FORCE

348
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,033
OF A TEAM OF 20 OR 30 LAWYERS

349
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,468
THAT CAN INVESTIGATE YOUR ENTIRE

350
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:01,338
LIFE FOR THE LAST 20 OR 30 YEARS

351
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,574
BRING YOU IN TO ASK YOU

352
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:05,976
QUESTIONS AND IF THEY CAN GET

353
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,711
YOU TO MAKE A MISSTATEMENT ON

354
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,480
SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T

355
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,215
REMEMBER CORRECTLY THAT YOU CAN

356
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:12,449
GO TO JAIL FOR THAT?

357
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:14,718
IT'S A CRAZY SITUATION.

358
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:15,652
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE THESE

359
00:11:15,652 --> 00:00:00,000
SPECIAL PROSECUTORS.
