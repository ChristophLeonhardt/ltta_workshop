president Trump's personal attorney John Dowd he's resigning he just confirmed to NBC's Kristen Welker telling her quotes I love the president and wish him very well The Post reports it is part of a shake-up of the legal team handling the special counsels Russia investigation we're gonna bring you more information as we get it let's go to Kristen Welker at the White House now Kristen what is going on this was a brief conversation with John Dowd that I just had staff he as you just reported did confirm that he issues his resignation I said can you tell me why mr. Dowd his response to that was I don't want to get into specifics but I love the president and wish him very well this is not a huge surprise Steph there's been a lot of discussion about a potential shake-up with the president's legal team over the weekend of course John Dowd issued that statement saying that he hopes that the special counsel essentially ends its investigation and that really ran counter to the initial strategy by the president's legal team which was to be cooperative which was to give the special counsel space and those comments came against the backdrop of discussions that were going on between the president's legal team and the special counsels team about a potential interview with President Trump some people said that that statement by John Dowd was seen by the President as a green light to go into attack mode and that that may have given him the license to send out those tweets attacking the special counsel which many saw as potentially harmful to the president harmful to those negotiations that are going on behind the scenes so this is the first major shake-up right now and it comes at a critical moment Steph again as these very sensitive negotiations are ongoing between the president's legal team and with the special counsels team about a potential interview the size scope way in which that interview is going to be carried out very much under discussion right now Steph so this is a big shake-up I'm also told they are looking to add to and beef up the legal team as they enter this new phase okay let's have a little history lesson though John Dowd is not the first lawyer to leave the team mark NASA wits president Truong a longtime lawyer left what was it last summer where's ty cobb in this mix what's he doing well Ty Cobb continues on as the President's Council here at the White House staff who handles this matter and his strategy and his approach to this has been to give the special counsel what the special counsel asks for to turn over as many documents have been asked for and you'll recall that the president's legal team has been very vocal about saying hey look we have handed over thousands of documents we are being transparent in this process we want to cooperate with the special counsel because there's nothing to see here there's nothing to hide that has been Ty Cobb's approach to all of this over the weekend I think there was some concern after you saw those tweets coming out from the president Republicans saying hey why are you acting guilty if you're innocent and a broad sense that that could be damaging that initial strategy of being cooperative being transparent cooperating with the special counsel so Ty Cobb very much continues on as a member of this team but he has also come under criticism from some of the president's allies so how long will he stay on there's no indication that he's going anywhere but rumblings of course that the entire legal team is going through some type of transformation as again stuff they enter this very critical phase of negotiations hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
