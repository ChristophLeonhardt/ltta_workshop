00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch this video the mental struggle is</font>

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,810
half the battle sometimes you have more

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,280
to offer people than you think you do

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,610
the only competition you have is

38
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,369
yourself think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it if you're the</font>

39
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,680
greatest it will naturally emerged that

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,439
you're the greatest and if you do have

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">that spot then the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only way you will</font>

42
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,250
keep that<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot is if you continue</font>

43
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,920
outdoing yourself why lower your

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,299
standards by competing against anyone

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,180
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> own your success f imposter</font>

46
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,790
syndrome except that sometimes you just

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,860
outgrow people learn to be okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">be your own rider die the haters are</font>

50
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,869
they become haters because while they're

54
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,790
