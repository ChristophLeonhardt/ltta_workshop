look at this Finance Minister Bill Morneau waited two years to disclose company that owns French villa to ethics watchdog now I'm not mad that Bill Morneau has a French villa he's rich he was born rich and then he married super-rich he married one of the heiress's of the McCain family fortune so like Justin Trudeau Bill Morneau got most of his family money by in harens and its well protected from taxes in fancy family trusts it's a lot of hutzpah for him and Justin Trudeau of all people to call you and I tax cheats and tighten the screws on us while shielding their inherited wealth from taxes but this isn't shielding things this is hiding things it's different this is lying it's different see when you are in a position of power and Trust in the federal government and when you make policy decisions about taxes and investments and money and things like that you have to tell the exit ethics Commissioner about your own holdings not all of it will be published to the public here's the ethics commissioner's website but some of it can be seen on this public website but most of it is kept private between you and the ethics commissioner but you have to disclose it to her so an independent officer of parliament knows if you are actually passing laws that would benefit you yourself your family your friends if you don't like that disclosure if you don't want to tell your personal personal wealth secrets to someone like that no problem no one has to then don't become Finance Minister it's invasive I'm sure a millionaire who married a billionaire and has a fancy villa in France surely likes his privacy fine then don't take the job of setting the rules that affect millionaires who marry billionaires who have fancy villas in France held in corporations Bill Morneau had to disclose it because he was finance minister he swore that he disclosed things but he lied he lied for two years till he was caught our finance minister is a liar he is hiding his wealth from the government he only fest up when reporters started asking about it hey how would the Canada Revenue Agency react to you if you just forgot to tell them but a French villa or some other valuable asset for two years whoopsies I'm not saying Morneau is hiding this from the taxman I'm not saying that I'm saying he hid it from the ethics commissioner just like Trudeau hid his illegal gift of a private island vacation from the ethics commissioner because don't you know there's one set of rules for the huggy kissy liberal royalty and then there's another set of rules for the poor Schmo z who are paying all the bills but that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
