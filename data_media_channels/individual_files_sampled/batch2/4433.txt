good evening Lawrence good evening Rachel and of course I was taking notes learning all about Dana buente and actually taking notes about his notes it was really extraordinary to see you revealing those actual handwritten notes which I would not have expected to see until they were introduced as exhibits either in a court room or in a hearing and in the Congress it really is as far as the notes go a word-for-word corroboration of what James Cummings testimony is you know it's what it tells me as a layman looking at this stuff is that people who are trained in the FBI and in the Justice Department people are trained as high-level prosecutors law enforcement personnel are trained to take really good notes for just such an occasion and Comey obviously was relying on his own notes from his conversations with the president when he put together that very careful testimony for Congress both his written testimony and his testimony under questioning so he was relying on his own notes and he was probably relying on those same note he may have been relying on those same notes when he spoke to Bente or those those comments on the President may have been so fresh that Ben Tate was able to write them down immediately after basically James Comey heard them from the president these guys put quotation marks in their notes their phrases are immediately echo each other and that's how you build it that's how you build a body of evidence these are trained professionals Rachel I'm gonna break with what I've got lined up here because I have Benjamin with us ready to go as one of our first guests this evening he's ready to jump in here from San Francisco he's a friend of James Comey he's also as you know the editor in chief of law fair senior fellow at the Brookings Institution an MSNBC analyst and AI Benjamin word is I just want to get your reaction to what Rachel revealed tonight and Dana blunt days notes basically confirming James commis testimony about the president's interactions with him well so it's of course completely unsurprising to those of us who know Jim Comey and know that if he tells some tells you something that happened in a congressional hearing and there's going to be corroboration of it then the corroboration is going to show you that that's exactly what happened and you know I'm delighted that Dana Ben Tate took notes of those conversations but I'm not the least bit surprised and that they show that as as Rachel reported and that that what Jim said was you know accurate in you know almost down to the level of the specific words and and you know those of us who know Jim know that you know whatever you agree with him you disagree with him he is an honest and trustworthy individual and I would urge people to go back to his testimony to watch that testimony and to think about the substance of the things that he said and if it helps that you know we now have the then Deputy Attorney General's notes corroborating it then great I think that's wonderful and Rachel that's the way you presented it tonight the notes and then cutting straight to the video testimony yeah and you know we're we're trying to you know a read the handwriting be make sure we're looking at what we think we're looking at and see put it in context in terms of what they would have known at the time and how this ends up becoming relevant in this ongoing case that potentially involves the president and obstruction of justice I mean for me one of the things that was really interesting here and I think it may have just been a kind of an accidental thing was this essentially cover letter from the counterintelligence chief at the FBI saying I know these documents are stamped top secret but I am hereby attesting that these are not classified documents that for us was additional corroboration that these were in fact Dana benkei's handwritten notes from his conversation with James Comey about on March 30th because the counterintelligence division at FBI had to step in to say that this classification was was improperly stamped on there so we're trying to follow the clues to make sure that what we're looking at is what we what we think we're looking at but we are surmising that the reason we've the reason these things were prepared and the way they were the reason the FBI had to sign off and the fact that they weren't classified is because we're guessing that this was all handed over to Muller and that this was part of bent preparing for his testimony to Muller as an important witness in this case Rachel one second let's just get a quick expert opinion from Benjamin Buddhist about that is it is that what is likely happened here that this has been handed over to the special prosecutor so I I can't imagine that the special prosecutor does not have all the parties contemporaneous notes that would have been produced at the time that would be something that they would do I can't I can't tell you that that is what happened obviously because I don't know but it certainly sounds plausible and it certainly would be implausible for the special prosecutor not to try to get his hands and not to successfully get his hands on all the notes that anybody would have made at the time moreover I think it is worth noting that you know a lot of people did take notes and write memos at the time and we know from from commis testimony that he left meetings with the president and back from the time he was president-elect and immediately wrote down the interactions that he had we also know that Andy McCabe had contemporaneous notes and so I think you know this is clearly a group of people who were very aware that they were dealing with momentous events and that they were participating in them and wanted records of their interactions and wanted very clear validations of their memory at the time and so you know I think if you had been in those rooms you would have taken notes - yeah yeah thank you perfect sense yeah Rachel thank you for your extraordinary reporting you need two shows tonight and so I wanted to give you as much of this one as you needed and I really wanted to hear what Benjamin would have said to say well
