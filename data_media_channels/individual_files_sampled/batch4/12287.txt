welcome to the show everybody thanks for watching I hope you've had a great morning so far so I want to get into something I wrote about yesterday I wrote a piece yesterday called the what was it called oh the four things that are destroying boys in our culture and I want to get my I want to talk about that I want to bring that conversation over to this forum as well because I think it's so important especially in a society where we hear so much about we hear about two things quite a bit we hear number one that boys are privileged that men are privileged there's this this mystical male privilege that we're always told about and that's you know we rarely see it manifest into anything into into anything tangible but we're told that it's there that men are men are so privileged to be in this culture and then number two worked we're told about the persecution and the oppression of women and in the midst of all this while we're having this discussion about male privilege and while we've got feminists complaining about other so they're so persecuted they're persecuted because you know female actresses in Hollywood don't make as much a female actress in a movie made only 5 million dollars while a male actor on the same movie made 15 million oh my gosh while we're talking about that kind of persecution or or oh oh my goodness you you don't want to pay for my birth control are you kidding me I'm oppressed pay for my birth control so while we're having that conversation boys concentrating specifically here on boys on young men they are dying I mean literally dying in many cases but also inside guy men are dying inside there's this emptiness this this confusion this kind of hollow Ness that we are fostering in boys and so I want to discuss that and talk about the things that that lead to that you know the great the great to challenges that boys face in our culture or another way of putting it the disadvantages there are some unique disadvantages that men particularly young boys suffer in our culture that women either do not suffer at all or they don't suffer at all to the same degree so the first thing and I talked about this in the video I did yesterday as well but I want to focus on because I think this is one aspect of the plight of men that isn't focused on nearly enough but our culture just relentlessly preys upon a boys weaknesses we now I just imagine the world that a 13 year old boy inhabits okay just put yours if you can just put yourself into the into the world into the mindset put yourself into the shoes of a of a 13 year old boy of the average thirteen year old boy in America so if you're this boy that means that you know you've long since been exposed to hardcore pornography you probably watch it regularly the average age of first exposure to pornography is I think 10 or 11 by according to most studies and I think that that's I think that's a pretty conservative estimate I think for many kids it's much much younger than that but let's say 10 or 11 so he's long since been exposed to hardcore pornography i watches it regularly probably doesn't really understand what it is or why he's even finds it appealing but he watches it and then puberty hits at right around 13 and his hormones are going crazy they're going haywire inside his head his brain is hardwiring itself to focus obsessively on sex now that isn't his fault he didn't he didn't choose this this is just how he is this is what this is the biological imperative there's bit there's there was a study done a little while ago that said that men I forget how it was phrased exactly but basically men focus more on sex than they do on food so if a man had to choose between food or sex he would take sex I think some of that stuff is kind of sensational III think you know if a guy's starving to death in the desert he has to choose between the two things he's probably gonna take the food I would think but even if that's a little sensational we know the reality is that especially for boys when they're going through puberty there is this intense preoccupation with sex that just kind of hits them all all of a sudden like a ton of bricks and they don't even know where it's coming from they don't understand it and he feels just this biological impulse to go out and to find a sexual partner even though he he doesn't understand this urge his conception of human sexuality has been perverted and degraded and confused by the porn habit he developed in sixth grade but still he is now in at the age of 13 a boy becomes fertile a fertile a boy can conceive a child at the age of 13 even even though girls his age for the most part are not fertile so this is this is again this is biology this is his body doing this saying oh well now you can have babies now you're gonna be focused on sex and the boy even though of course he's too young for all this he's too young for sex but he can't escape but it can't escape sex it's all over his computer it's all over his phone it's all over social media it's all over the TV it's all over the music he listens to it's all over the advertisements he's you know it's it's billboards and just everything everywhere he turns you know even the magazine rack and the supermarket I mean everywhere he turns and he's his hormones are already going crazy he's already preoccupied in everywhere he turns there's this temptation there's this there's this preying upon what's already preoccupying his head and then he goes to school and he sees that his female classmates are dressed like strippers and in fact most of the places that he go that he goes in life that's how the women are dressed because they say well this is my body it's my purge in oh you just don't look it's not my problem it's not my problem if I'm you know leading these boys into sin it doesn't start not my problem at all it's your problem I don't care about them because that's the attitude that we've fostered in girls it seems that everyone is doing everything they can to make a degenerate and a creep out of them even as they demand that he not become a degenerate or a creep they're doing everything they can literally everything they can to make him into one while saying well hey never become this thing that we are trying our hardest to turn you into and so we demand self-discipline we demand self-control from this boy while providing him absolutely no tools whatsoever to develop them and rather than tools we just give him temptation upon temptation upon temptation non-stop temptation everywhere he goes all day every day right at the moment when his brain is least able to cope with it or overcome it and even if so that's all bad enough even if the boy possesses this kind of superhuman moral fortitude the kind of moral fortitude that he's gonna need to pursue chastity and purity in the midst of this in the midst of this degenerate sex-crazed culture even if he has that well what's he gonna meet when he goes out and he and he tries to pursue chastity and purity what's he gonna mean from our society mockery discouragement the very people who demand that he respect women and control himself those same people will then heap scorn on him if he tries to do exactly what they demand he do we we blame boys for not being virtuous enough and then if they try to be virtuous we laugh at them that's the situation of boys in again in that case the boy is going to need to call upon this kind of superhuman courage one more time so we can just like he rejected the temptations now he has to now he has to reject all the jeers and everything so he can walk this path to virtue and he's gonna have to walk it on his own from with no help from anyone including his parents much of the time because that brings us to the second disadvantage in our culture there is a lack of male leadership and male role models and it is truly catastrophic we know some of the statistics we know that 20% of the kids in this country grow up without dads in the home that's 17 million kids in the black community the percentage is 70 or 80 percent okay 70 to 80 percent of the kids in the black community grow up in fatherless homes which is again a catastrophic apocalyptic number that a community cannot survive like that when you've when you've only got when you've only got 20 to 30% of your kids who have dads at home now on the other hand almost every kid has a mother in the home with rare exception so a girl will have a female role model in her mother and not only that but when she goes to school most of the teachers I think 75 76 percent of teachers in the public school system are women so she goes to school and she's got female role models at school and she's even more likely to have a grandmother in her life than a grandfather because men died five or six years before before before women do so she's got no shortage of female role models she's got female role models just basically falling out of the sky I mean they're everywhere everywhere she turns there's a female role model which is great and we should celebrate that we should be happy for that that's a fantastic thing it's also a profound advantage that girls have over boys even though boys have privilege they're so privileged but they're not even privileged enough to have a dad around to say hey this is what a man is supposed to do and even the boys who have dads in the home that doesn't mean that they have male role models you'll find very often that despite the father's physical presence the mother is still the spiritual leader in the home among Christians I don't know what the exact number is but statistically it's the mother who takes the child the children to church while the dad stays home and his pajamas too lazy to even get up and go to church she's the one who takes over the religious duties of the family in most families now the the mother is the spiritual leader so the father what is the father he's a warm body you know you know taking up space he's a he's a paycheck maybe Oh hopefully he goes out and brings home a paycheck at least but many of these dads they're not leading their family and they are not providing an example to their sons they're just leaving their sons hanging them out to dry and saying hey you figure it out so if a boy wants to be a man if he wants to know how to be a man and that by the way is something that we need to teach kids a boy needs to be taught how to be a man a girl needs to be taught how to be a girl how to be a woman but a many boys they don't have anyone around to teach them that so either they can turn to their mother and they can hope that their mother can somehow teach them how to be a man and she can do her best and she could even do a heroic job in trying to teach that lesson but she's never going to be able to do it the way that a man can because when it comes to how to be a man a woman can tell you based on her observations what she thinks a man does but she cannot show you she's a woman all she can show you is what a woman does it takes a man to show another man what a man does so if he doesn't have me if he doesn't want to turn to his mother then what's he gonna do what what do many boys in this culture do what's the next place you can't you can't look in the home you don't look to the schools you know you're not going to church you can't look to the church so where do you look then for your male role model you turn on the TV and many of these boys now they're turning to musicians they're turning to actors celebrities superheroes for their idea of masculinity and they developed this cartoonish kind of hollow idea of manhood and they become cartoonish Hollow men that's what I noticed when I you know when I look around I see a lot of cartoon men walking around do you know what I mean a lot of these men they're cartoons they've got this idea of masculinity that's cartoonish and they're walking around it's like they're wearing a costume because they don't even know who they are so that's another disadvantage third the education system is designed for girls there's a reason why girls outperform men outperform boys in the school system and it's not because they're smarter statistically you know girls are not any smarter than boys yet they do so much better in school even though the boys with all their privilege somehow they can't even get somehow they can't even get good grades in school why is that because the classroom is set up is set up to foster or to cater to the girls it is set up to reward the kind of calm organized demeanor that's natural to girls boys are not like that for the most part with exception boys are not like that boys are rambunctious they have physical energy you know they have trouble sitting still I got a four-year-old boy at home this is him totally I mean he's got he's bouncing off the walls he's got all this energy he's got trouble sitting still he doesn't like sitting still you know he's not able to focus intentive attentively on a dull task for a prolonged period of time my daughter can sit there and you know she can draw a picture she could she could sit still for for an hour or more and just do something I mean she could sit there and brush her dolls hair she could set up a tea party she could do something like that meanwhile my son is bouncing off the walls he's pretending to be the Hulk he's you know that's what he's doing he's saying daddy let's play can we go let's play tag let's play hide-and-seek can we go outside I mean he wants to do things that's what that's what boys want to do but the classroom is not designed for kids like that it doesn't know what to do with them it can't do anything with them so it Penn Eliza's them it penalized his boys for being boys as a result boys get lower grades boys are more likely to drop out of school boar's boys are more likely to be expelled to be suspended remember with all their privilege we've all got this privilege but they're failing out of school they're dropping out they're getting a spell they're getting suspended and worst of all I think because that boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD listen listen to this figure okay by high school 20 percent of boys will have been diagnosed with ADHD and a large number of them will be on drugs somehow you know we never stop to ask ourselves why is it that boys are somehow more susceptible to this mysterious mental condition that's crazy isn't it if this is really just a mental condition and anyone could get it then why does it always affect boys why are boys the white what can anyone explain that we never stop to consider that maybe what we're doing it's that we're not diagnosing individual boys with ADHD what we're doing instead is we are diagnosing boyhood itself we are saying boyhood itself is a disease and there's no place for it in school now if the school system were not predicated on sitting still and memorizing and regurgitating information and filling out dittos and worksheets okay if the school system were not predicated on that there would be no ADHD it would be like magic all the 88 ADHD class cases in the world will just evaporate it would be gone because it's all conditional ADHD exists in the classroom it doesn't exist in the woods when they're you know when your son goes out and plays in the woods and he's playing with sticks and he's climbing trees there's no there's no ADHD there is there there's no ADHD in a tree in a tree fort it's only in a classroom because we've decided that we'll we need boys to sit still for seven hours a day five days a week for 12 years nine months out of the year repeating information that's what we need them to do and if they can't do it we will stuff pills into their face and make them and if they still can't do it kick them out of school but that's privileged that's their privilege I mean seriously before you tell me about male privilege have we turned womanhood into a disease well actually we kind of had that's that's we actually have done that with the birth control pill but that's that's a that's a different conversation number four masculinity is is denigrated in this culture now you'd think after we just got through the first three steps and you'd think well that's enough I mean we can lay off now right we've done enough to these boys we've thrown sex in their face every second of the day we have deprived them of role models we have put them into an education system that treats their personality as a disease so we've done all that I mean aren't we satisfied now can we just leave them alone at that point can we just let them be but no because if they managed to survive that gauntlet then the next step is we bury them under just mounds and mounds of self-loathing we attack masculinity now femininity is also attacked in our culture but not nearly as explicitly not directly okay nobody is is is is going around and saying that femininity is toxic or fragile nobody talks about female privilege nobody does that nobody's gonna say that all women are dangerous nobody's saying that these are the special denigration x' and accusations that are reserved for men and for boys so think about what happens think about a boy you know just follow along these four steps and think about a boy that falls into every category I've listed and that's that's millions of boys do there are millions of boys who you start with they're watching porn at 10:00 or 11:00 they hit puberty they're dealing with all that they don't have a dad at home they go to school they get diagnosed with ADHD they're told there's something wrong there their entire time they spend 12 13 years in in grade school and the entire time they're there they're told there's something wrong with you there's something wrong with you sit down shut up repeat the information on the did oh shut up sit down there's something wrong with you you're diseased you have a condition take this pill why didn't you take your pill today and that's what the boy is dealing with for 12 or 13 years and then he comes out and let's say he manages to go to college and that's when the feminism hits him and that's when the feminists go after he's just he's barely he could barely walk he's emerging from this gauntlet like just just just bruised and battered and and on drugs and everything and he gets to college and then that's what you're a man you've got privileged men are dangerous and then at that point it's just his defenses are down he's susceptible to it there's nothing you can do so after we have broken men down broken boys down I should say the final step now that we have them like putty in our hands now the final step is to remove their masculinity from them a masculinity that they've never really come into in the first place that they never understood that they never grew into because they they never had because of the last three things I mentioned and so it's not very hard for our culture than the come in and the feminists and the college colleges they can come in and they could just take this masculinity that's already bruised and battered and they just remove it from the man and feminized him why do you think it is there's another medical mystery here so we've got the medical mystery of why is it mostly boys that have ADHD another medical mystery is why is it mostly men that are transgender have you noticed that most of these stories that you hear about transgender eight-year-old eight-year-olds whose parents are so accepting of it which is by the way their parents are abusive and should be in prison but their parents are so except together in almost every case it's a boy turning into a girl and then as you get older the transgender community is the transgender community is comprised primarily of men why is that could it have something to do with the fact that there is a crisis of identity in American manhood there is a crisis of identity because we've got these boys who grow up and they never learned what it means to be a man they never learned to embrace their masculinity they never learned to see it as a good and constructive and a beautiful thing they never learned to that that that you know there's a place for men in society that they never learned that society needs men to be men and to do certain things and to you know men are the ones who're fighting the wars and building the bridges and building the buildings of protecting and providing its men doing that mostly I mean men literally literally built this civilization but they don't learn that because that would be upsetting you know to the feminists and that might hurt a girl's feeling so we can't talk about that and so that means so what do we do we all of the things that men uniquely contribute we say you can't talk about that no you don't you're not unique at all you don't contribute anything special at all shut up you're sexist patriarchy how dare you suggest that there's anything special about being a man there's nothing special about you you're not special being a man is nothing a woman can do would do anything that a man can do that's what we say to men but to women we say oh my gosh being a woman is beautiful it's a special you could do anything I mean the world needs women I mean we need more women CEOs and more women in business we need more women in the mill that we need women we need more women we need women Ghostbusters and women's superheroes we need women all over the place because you know we can't it just meant women are so special and then a boy tries to pipe up and say well what about me I'll shut up you and then somehow mysteriously we end up with a bunch of men who are feminized and in some cases literally feminized they literally try to become women I think all these things are related and I think we need to face this because this is what our sons will face and we should look away from it and if we care about our sons and we love our sons then we need to prepare them to deal with all these things because this is the world that they're entering into alright everybody thank you for watching and I'll talk to you tomorrow
