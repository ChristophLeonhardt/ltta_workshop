if you're a fan of drama and soap operas on a national scale you should be following Brazilian politics it's got impeachments corruption scandals betrayals raging passions it even comes with an R rating for violence it's a guilty pleasure addictive with its twists and turns and a season finale is just around the corner the country goes to the polls in a general election at this Sunday it's not one to miss if only to see the fate of the main protagonist meet jury your bolson ro labelled the Trump of the tropics like his blonde counterparts his relationship with women is complicated he shoots from the hip and is a fan of firearms as well as the Bible apparently just look at his slogan his supporters like Trump fans admire someone who says it how it is bosun R says what everybody wants to say but does not have the courage to say that's why I'm voting booth you know what demagogue I believe what he says and he's an honest person he's patriotic he's made it this far because he is not corrupt he's like family because he is ethical he is our only hope and that is why I'm here even those who love to hate Wilson ro can't stand him because of his similarities to trump even the inevitable protest movement is comparable to hashtag resistance in the USA although the anti-trump backlash never quite reached such fever-pitch levels possibly because nobody managed to get to trump anyhow balsa Naru has suffered for his straight-talking even getting stabbed at a campaign rally balsan ro is like trump upgraded he takes things to a whole new level but even those outbursts haven't shaken his lead in the polls his Trump like promises are playing their part no more government red tape put Brazil first privatized state-owned firms get real tough on crime at all costs and in the country that has a history of rampant crime and corruption his calls have found an audience population is fed up with corruption populations fed up with economic crisis and a crisis of representativity of the traditional parties so the very fact that bosun ro is leading the race as a front-runner is the sign of times here people really don't care about what they he actually think about gay people or minorities or or human rights they really wanna change he embodies dis change one can argue that his is not serious about being the change he's not prepared for being a change this is a good argument he was really a fringe figure in Brazilian politics come on who's always been there but it was never important he changed parties all the time but the point is his contenders that they failed to present themselves as better options even though technically they might be better options you
