>>> TODAY HE'LL HOLD THE CASKET 
OF JOHN McCAIN.
OUR MOST REVERED LEADERS.
WE HAVE SEEN SEVERAL OF McCAIN'S
COLLEAGUES ENTER THE ROTUNDA 
EARLIER TODAY ALONG WITH 
CELEBRITIES AND ACTRESSES LIKE 
WARREN BEATTY, AND HE HAS CALLED
HIS TIME THERE IN THE SENATE THE
MOST IMPORTANT JOB, I HAVE HAD 
IN MY LIFE.
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS SAID THE 
LIONS OF THE SENATE ARE GONE.
IT IS VERY SAD.
TALKING OF COURSE, ABOUT SENATOR
TED KENNEDY AS WELL.
I WANT TO BRING IN JONATHAN 
KARL.
AS WE SEE THE HEARSE NOW 
ARRIVING HERE TO CAPITOL HILL, 
YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> Reporter: WELL, SEEING JOHN 
McCAIN GO INTO THAT BUILDING FOR
THE LAST TIME, IT'S AN EMOTIONAL
EXPERIENCE.
THIS IS A SENATOR WHO MADE A LOT
OF ENEMIES IN THAT BUILDING.
HE SPARRED MIGHTILY WITH 
DEMOCRATS.
HE SPARRED SOMETIMES EVEN MORE 
MIGHTILY WITH FELLOW 
REPUBLICANS, BUT ULTIMATELY, I 
DON'T THINK IN MY 20 YEARS 
COVERING THE CAPITOL, THE 
CONGRESS, I SAW SOMEBODY WHO WAS
MORE WIDELY RESPECTED, MORE 
ULTIMATELY BELOVED THAN JOHN 
McCAIN, SO I SUSPECT YOU WILL 
SEE A LONG, LONG LINE OF 
STAFFERS, OF MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
EVERYBODY, COMING IN TO PAY 
THEIR RESPECTS.
I KNOW, TOM, WHEN WE GET OFF THE
AIR, I'M GOING UP THERE.
McCAIN HAD A -- HAD A UNIQUE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS.
HE WOULD FIGHT WITH REPORTERS.
HE COULD BE CRANKY AND SPAR WITH
YOU, BUT NOBODY I THINK -- ANY 
PUBLIC FIGURE I EVER COVERED -- 
HAD MORE OF A RESPECT AND BELIEF
IN THE IMPORTANCE FOR WHAT WE 
DO, FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF A FREE
AND VIGOROUS PRESS, EVEN A PRESS
THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION 
COULD ANNOY HIM.
>> JON, STAND BY FOR US.
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING OUR 
COVERAGE RIGHT NOW, WE'RE 
LOOKING AT A HEARSE THAT HAS 
JUST ARRIVED TO THE U.S. CAPITOL
CARRYING THE BODY OF JOHN 
McCAIN.
I WANT TO BRING IN COKIE ROBERTS
NOW.
TALK TO US ABOUT THIS MOMENT 
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF
THE ULTIMATE, IF NOT, THE 
ULTIMATE HONOR WE CAN GIVE ANY 
LEADER IN OUR COUNTRY.
11 PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD THIS 
HONOR.
A HANDFUL OF SENATORS AND IT WAS
DECIDED PRETTY QUICKLY THAT 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN WOULD 
RECEIVE THIS TREATMENT AS WELL.
>> HE HAS HAD EXTRAORDINARY 
TREATMENT ALL WEEK, HONORING HIS
UNIQUE PLACE IN HISTORY AS JON 
SAID.
HE WAS VERY RESPECTED IN THE 
SENATE, ALTHOUGH OFTEN IRRATED 
BY THEM, AND THE MOST RECENT 
SENATOR TO LIE IN THIS SPOT WAS 
OF HAWAII.
HE WAS A MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER.
THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON THAT 
HAS THIS -- THIS UNIQUE RESPECT 
FROM THE CONGRESS AND THE 
COUNTRY, AND HERE IN WASHINGTON 
TODAY, THERE WERE ANNOUNCEMENTS 
BEING MADE ON TELEVISION AND 
RADIO STATIONS.
YOU CAN COME TO THE CAPITOL AT 
1:00 AND BE THERE TO PAY YOUR 
RESPECTS TO JOHN McCAIN.
I SUSPECT THAT MANY, MANY 
THOUSANDS WILL DO THAT.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST IS
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE 
ROTUNDA SURPRISING THE CAPITOL 
POLICE AND THE CAPITOL ARCHITECT
WHO RUNS THE PLACE WITH HOW MANY
PEOPLE COME AND COME ALL NIGHT 
LONG.
IT IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO PAY 
RESPECT TO THEIR HEROES, AND 
JOHN McCAIN WAS CERTAINLY A 
HERO.
>> COKIE, STAND BY FOR US.
WE JUST GOT OUR FIRST GLIMPSE --
THE STARS AND STRIPES, THE FLAG 
THAT IS DRAPING THE COFFIN OF 
SENATOR McCAIN.
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY POIGNANT
MOMENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE
LAST FEW DAYS, INCLUDING WITH 
HIS WIFE, CINDY McCAIN, WHO 
KISSED HER HUSBAND'S COFFIN 
EARLIER THIS WEEK, AND 
YESTERDAY, SENATOR McCAIN TAKING
HIS LAST FLIGHT, LEAVING HIS 
HOME STATE OF ARIZONA AND 
ARRIVING IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
THERE'S THAT IMAGE RIGHT THERE, 
SO TOUCHING.
SO UNFORGETTABLE, AND THERE WILL
BE A LOT OF MOMENTS LIKE THAT 
BOTH TODAY AND TOMORROW AT A 
CEREMONY AND LATER ON SUNDAY 
WHEN HE IS EVENTUALLY BURIED.
WE CAN SEE THE VETERANS WHO 
SENATOR McCAIN FOUGHT SO HARD 
FOR, OF COURSE, A VETERAN 
HIMSELF.
LAST NIGHT AS THAT COFFIN 
ARRIVED AND THE PLANE HAD 
LANDED, IT WAS ONE OF OUR 
SECRETARIES.
SECRETARY MATTIS, THE SECRETARY 
OF DEFENSE WHO WAS WITH CINDY 
McCAIN.
HE WILL BE ONE OF THE 
PALLBEARERS TO GREET HER AS SHE 
ARRIVED.
THIS WAS JUST LAST NIGHT.
THESE ARE SOME LIVE PICTURE THAT
IS WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.
EXCUSE ME.
THIS IS JUST LAST NIGHT AS 
SENATOR McCAIN HAD ARRIVED HERE 
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
SECRETARY MATTIS WILL BE ONE OF 
THE PALLBEARERS TOMORROW, AND SO
MANY ACROSS THE POLITICAL 
SPECTRUM WILL BE PALLBEARERS.
PEOPLE FROM WARREN BEATTY, TO 
JOE BIDEN WHO EULOGIZED HIM SO 
ELOQUENTLY YESTERDAY.
TO FEINGOLD, TO SENATOR GRAHAM, 
THERE TO HONOR THEIR FRIEND AND 
THEIR COLLEAGUE.
WE'RE WAITING AT ANY MOMENT FOR 
THE CEREMONY TO START HERE.
JON KARL, YOUR THOUGHTS ON 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS TRANSPIRED 
OVER THE WEEKS.
ALL THE SPEECHES WE HAVE HEARD, 
AND JUST REALLY THE TOUCHING 
NOTES FROM PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR 
LINDSEY GRAHAM AND JOE BIDEN?
>> Reporter: TOM, WHAT STRIKES 
ME IS THE WAY McCAIN 
METICULOUSLY PLANNED HIS OWN 
MEMORIAL.
HE KNEW WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED 
WITH BRAIN CANCER THAT HE HAD A 
DEATH SENTENCE, AND HIS -- HE 
STARTED WORKING WITH HIS CLOSEST
FRIENDS AND ADVISERS ON PLANNING
THIS MEMORIAL.
AND THIS WASN'T ABOUT 
MEMORIALIZING HIMSELF.
HE WAS LOOKING OUT AT A COUNTRY 
THAT WAS DEEPLY DIVIDED.
HE WAS LOOKING OUT AT A 
POLITICAL SITUATION THAT FRANKLY
HORRIFIED HIM.
HE SAID TO HIS CLOSE ADVISERS, 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD.
EXCEPT HE USED A WORD THAT I 
CAN'T SAY ON TELEVISION.
HE SAID THAT THE SITUATION, THE 
DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT 
HAVE TO BE SO BITTER, DOESN'T 
HAVE TO BE SO AWFUL, AND HE 
WANTED THIS WEEK OF EVENTS TO BE
A -- TO BE SYMBOLIC ABOUT THE 
WAY -- THE WAY POLITICAL 
DIFFERENCES IN THIS COUNTRY 
SHOULD BE OVERCOME.
THAT'S WHY HE REACHED OUT.
HE WASN'T PARTICULARLY CLOSE AT 
ALL -- TRUST ME -- WITH BARACK 
OBAMA OR GEORGE W. BUSH, BUT 
SYMBOLICALLY, IT WAS SO 
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO HAVE BOTH 
OF THOSE FORMER PRESIDENTS WHO 
HE RAN AGAINST AND LOST TO, ONE 
VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN.
ONE A PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT.
HE WANTED TO HAVE BOTH OF THEM 
COME TOGETHER AND TO SPEAK AT 
HIS MEMORIAL.
AND I THINK THAT WAS A LARGE 
PART OF WHAT WAS BEHIND JOE 
BIDEN SPEAKING OUT IN ARIZONA, 
BUT HE WAS SOMEBODY THAT TOUCHED
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM 
PERSONALLY, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WHO SIMPLY KNEW HIS STORY, AND 
THIS WAS HIS FINAL MOMENT.
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING 
TRANSPIRE THIS WEEK.
DESIGNED AND CHOREOGRAPHED BY 
JOHN McCAIN HIMSELF.
>> WE'RE GETTING OUR FIRST LOOK 
AT CINDY McCAIN WITH THEIR SONS 
JACK AND JIMMY AT THE TOP OF THE
STEPS THERE.
THE FIRST GLIMPSES WE ARE 
GETTING OF THE McCAIN FAMILY AS 
THEY ARE SET TO ENTER THE 
ROTUNDA.
SO MUCH OF TODAY IS ABOUT 
TRADITION.
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEING 
THERE FOR 150 YEARS, AND 
SOMETHING WILL BE DIFFERENT.
THAT'S THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE
COUNTRY IS NOT GOING TO BE 
THERE.
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WILL 
BE THERE, AND THE PRESIDENT SAID
HE IS SENDING GENERAL JOHN 
KELLY, ALONG WITH JOHN BOLTON, 
BUT HE WILL NOT BE THERE, AND HE
IS IN WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW, JON.
>> Reporter: AND THIS IS -- 
THERE IS A COUPLE OF THINGS 
GOING ON THERE.
ONE IS CLEARLY PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP DOESN'T -- NEVER HAS HAD 
MUCH OF A HIGH OPINION OR 
RESPECT FOR THAT MATTER, FOR 
JOHN McCAIN.
OBVIOUSLY FAMOUSLY DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN SAID THAT HE, YOU KNOW,
AS FAR AS WAR HEROES, HE PREFERS
PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T CAPTURED, 
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T SIMPLY A 
SLIP OF THE TONGUE.
IT'S SOMETHING HE HAD SAID 
ON "60 MINUTES" WAY BACK IN 
1999.
KIND OF A DEEPLY FELT LACK OF 
RESPECT, BUT THE FEELING RAN 
BOTH WAYS, AND McCAIN -- AND AS 
YOU SEE REALLY QUITE A MOMENT 
AGAIN COMING.
HIS CASKET ABOUT TO COME OUT OF 
THAT HEARSE AND TO GO INTO THAT 
CAPITOL BUILDING FOR THE LAST 
TIME.
JOHN McCAIN, HE PLANNED THESE 
EVENTS, HE MADE IT CLEAR THROUGH
FRIENDS HE DIDN'T MORELY WANT 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES TAKING PART IN THIS.
>> EVEN FROM THE GRAVE, REFUSING
TO BUILD A BRIDGE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT.
THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS JUST TOO 
FRACTURED.
AS JON MENTIONED, WE ARE GETTING
OUR FIRST LOOK NOW AT THE CASKET
THAT'S ABOUT TO COME OUT OF THE 
HEARSE AND ENTER THE ROTUNDA.
IT WILL LIE IN STATE ALL DAY.
FOR FIRST HIS FAMILY AND 
COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE AND THE
HOUSE, AND SOME OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION TO COME AND PAY 
THEIR RESPECTS.
THERE IS A SERVICE, ABOUT 30 
MINUTES WHERE THE CHAPLAIN WILL 
SPEAK, THE SENATE CHAPLAIN WHO 
USED TO BE THE NAVY CHAPLAIN AS 
WELL.
BARRY BLACK, A DECORATED NAVY 
VETERAN, REVERED ADMIRAL, AND 
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SENATE 
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL,
HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN AND VICE
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AS WELL AS 
CHUCK SCHUMER.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR 
THE STORIES AND MEMORIES THEY 
SHARE AS WE WATCH THIS POIGNANT 
MOMENT.
COKIE, YOUR THOUGHTS AS THE 
EVENTS OF TODAY ARE ABOUT TO 
BEGIN.
>> THIS IS A DIFFICULT MOMENT.
AS JON SAID COMING TO THE 
CAPITOL FOR THE LAST TIME, AND 
IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT FOR 
THESE PALLBEARERS CARRYING HIM 
UP THESE LONG STEPS INTO THE 
ROTUNDA, AND THE ROTUNDA ITSELF 
IS SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE.
I THINK JOHN McCAIN WOULD HAVE 
MUCH PREFERRED TO BE WALKING 
THROUGH IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE CAPITOL TO TAKE THE OATH OF 
OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, BUT THAT WAS NOT 
TO BE, AND NOW HE WILL BE 
HONORED IN THE WAY THAT OTHERS 
HAVE BEEN HONORED UNDER PICTURES
THAT MATTER A GREAT DEAL.
OF -- PICTURES THAT ARE GEORGE 
WASHINGTON SURRENDERING HIS 
COMMISSION SAYING, THIS IS NOT 
GOING TO BE A MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOVERNMENT
OF CONSENT BY THE PEOPLE, AND 
JOHN McCAIN UNDERSTOOD WHEN HIS 
MILITARY CAREER WAS OVER THAT 
THE WAY THAT HE COULD SERVE THE 
COUNTRY WAS THROUGH THAT CONSENT
OF THE VOTERS OF ARIZONA.
>> AS THE RAIN HAS STARTED TO 
FALL IN WASHINGTON, WE'RE GOING 
TO WATCH THIS MOMENT AND PAUSE 
FOR A SECOND.
>> AS WE WATCH THIS, YOU HAVE TO
ADMIRE THE DILIGENCE AND THE 
DISCIPLINE OF OUR MEN FROM THE 
NAVY HERE THAT ARE CARRYING THE 
CASKET, CARRYING SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN INTO THE ROTUNDA AS THE 
RAIN IS STARTING TO FALL EVEN 
HARDER THERE IN WASHINGTON, 
MAKING SURE THEY DON'T MISS A 
STEP.
MARCHING IN PRECISE, PERFECT 
ORDER.
THOUGH SENATOR McCAIN SERVED THE
PEOPLE OF ARIZONA, HE ALSO 
SERVED THE PEOPLE OF THIS 
COUNTRY, AND IN MANY WAYS, 
JONATHAN KARL, SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN IS COMING HOME BECAUSE HE
WAS SO MUCH A FIXTURE OF 
WASHINGTON, SO MUCH A FIXTURE OF
THE CAPITOL AND THE SENATE 
FLOOR.
>> Reporter: SO MUCH A FIXTURE 
OF THE CAPITOL, THE PEOPLE WHO 
WORKED THERE, NOT MERELY HIS 
COLLEAGUES, DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS, NOT MERELY THE 
STAFF THAT RUN THE PLACE, BUT 
THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED THERE.
I MEAN I SAW HIM AND I WALKED 
ALL OVER THE CAPITOL WITH JOHN 
McCAIN AND RODE THE CAPITOL 
SUBWAY FROM THE CAPITOL BUILDING
TO THE RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING 
WHERE HE HAD HIS OFFICE FOR SO 
MANY YEARS, AND WHERE THERE IS A
MOVEMENT NOW TO TRY TO RENAME 
THE BUILDING THE McCAIN SENATE 
OFFICE BUILDING.
HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
PEOPLE THAT -- THAT DROVE THE 
SUBWAY, THE LITTLE SUBWAY THAT 
WENT BETWEEN THE CAPITOL AND 
THAT BUILDING, THE POLICE 
OFFICERS THAT GUARDED THE 
BUILDING, THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED
IN THE -- IN THE LITTLE 
CAFETERIAS IN THE CAPITOL.
THEY ALL KNEW HIM.
HE KNEW THEM.
HE ALWAYS HAD A WORD TO SAY TO 
THEM.
THIS WAS -- THIS WAS A PLACE 
THAT REALLY GREW -- AS I SAID --
GREW TO LOVE JOHN McCAIN.
EVEN AS HE WAGED SOME PRETTY 
EPIC BATTLES, TOM, IN THAT 
BUILDING, AND RUFFLED A LOT OF 
FEATHERS, AND IRRITATED A LOT OF
HIS COLLEAGUES.
BUT ULTIMATELY, LOOK AT THEM 
THERE.
ABOVE ALL, ABOVE ALL, IT WAS 
RESPECT THAT THEY HAD FOR JOHN 
McCAIN.
>> WE ARE SEEING JOHN KELLY 
RIGHT NOW, SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM AS WELL.
ONE OF THE QUOTE/UNQUOTE THREE 
AMIGOS, AS WELL AS JOHN 
LIEBERMAN, AND KELLYANNE CONWAY 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
ADMINISTRATION.
ROD ROSENSTEIN AS WELL.
SOMEWHAT OF AN UNEXPECTED 
TURNOUT WITH SOME OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION HERE, BUT CLEARLY
SHOWING THEIR RESPECTS.
GOVERNOR SCOTT OF FLORIDA THERE,
GOVERNOR DUCEY AS WELL OF 
ARIZONA AS WE PAN ACROSS THE 
ROOM, AND INSIDE THE ROTUNDA, 
COKIE ROBERTS.
IT'S STANDING ROOM ONLY.
THEY LEAVE THE CENTER COMPLETELY
OPEN FOR SENATOR McCAIN AND HIS 
RIGHT PLACE.
>> RIGHT THERE AS YOU SAY THAT 
WAS QUICKLY BUILT FOR ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN, AND UNTIL RECENTLY WAS 
KEPT UNDERNEATH THE DOME IN A 
KIND OF CREEPY PLACE IN THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITAL, BUT NOW 
YOU SEE NANCY PELOSI, CONNIE 
MAROLLA -- 
>> JOE CROWLEY.
>> PEOPLE OF BOTH PARTIES, 
REALLY THERE TO SAY GOOD-BYE, 
AND THAT REALLY SHOWS YOU HOW 
McCAIN DID CROSS THAT LINE.
THIS IS NOT A REPUBLICAN EVENT.
THE MINORITY LEADER OF THE 
SENATE CHUCK SCHUMER WE JUST 
SAW.
HERE COMES THE FAMILY, AND THEY 
ARE SITTING UNDER PICTURES BY 
THE WAY OF COLUMBUS COMING TO 
AMERICA AND OF POCAHONTAS SAVING
THE LIFE OF JOHN SMITH IN 
JAMESTOWN.
SO THE EARLIEST PICTURES OF 
EUROPEANS IN AMERICA ARE OVER 
THE FAMILY AS THEY COME IN TO 
HAVE THIS CEREMONY.
THE LAST CIVIC CEREMONY BEFORE 
THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONY.
>> AND COKIE, AS YOU WERE 
TALKING, I WAS NOTICING THE 
ENTIRE McCAIN FAMILY WALKING IN,
AND SOMEBODY WAS SITTING DOWN 
AND I WAS WONDERING WHO THAT 
WAS, AND THAT OF COURSE, IS 
SENATOR McCAIN'S MOTHER, 106 
YEARS OLD.
ROBERTA McCAIN WHO HAS LIVED 
SUCH AN INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE 
LIFE.
HER HUSBAND OF COURSE, NAVY 
ADMIRAL.
SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE NAVY.
SHE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD 
AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN 
SERVICE WITH HER FAMILY.
YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE DIRECTLY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN 
SITTING DOWN.
AGAIN, 106 YEARS YOUNG I SHOULD 
SAY, AND SHE ALSO HAD TO 
WITHSTAND AND STAY STRONG WHILE 
HER SON WAS IN A VIETNAMESE 
PRISON CAMP FOR 5 1/2 YEARS AND 
SHE HAD TO ENDURE THAT, AND 
SENATOR McCAIN WOULD ALWAYS 
SHARE INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT 
HER HOW WHEN SHE WENT TO EUROPE 
AND SHE WAS TOO OLD TO RENT A 
CAR, SO SHE BOUGHT A CAR AND SHE
WAS DRIVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
IN HER 90s, BUT CLEARLY SOMEBODY
WHO WAS OF STRONG CHARACTER, AND
SOMEBODY WHO SHE TOO HAS SERVED 
THIS COUNTRY, AND NOW HAS TO 
WITNESS THIS.
NO DOUBT, A TOUGH MOMENT FOR 
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THAT 
FAMILY, INCLUDING OF COURSE, OUR
COLLEAGUE MEGHAN McCAIN.
EARLIER WE SAW CHUCK SCHUMER WHO
JON HAD MENTIONED THEY CHANGE 
THE NAME THE RUSSELL SENATE 
BUILDING TO THE McCAIN SENATE 
BUILDING.
THAT OF COURSE, WILL TAKE SOME 
TIME.
SENATOR McCONNELL HAS TABLED 
THAT FOR THE MOMENT TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS WITH THAT, BUT IT WOULD 
BE ONE OF MANY HONORS THAT THEY 
WOULD LIKE TO MEMORIALIZE 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, AND 
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD SEE 
HAPPEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
AS WE LOOK AT ALL THE DEMOCRATS,
NANCY PELOSI, REPRESENTATIVE JOE
CROWLEY AND OTHERS.
THIS CEREMONY IS SET TO GET 
UNDER WAY ANY MOMENT NOW.
THE INVOCATION WILL BE GIVEN BY 
FATHER PAT CONROY, AND AS I 
MENTIONED, WE'LL HEAR FROM MITCH
McCONNELL, HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL 
RYAN, MIKE PENCE, ALL SET TO 
SPEAK ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES,
PROBABLY CLOSER TO FIVE MINUTES 
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.
WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM OTHERS AS 
WELL.
AS I MENTIONED, BARRY BLACK WILL
TAKE THE BENEDICTION, AND HE 
TOO, A MEMBER OF THE NAVY.
THE NAVY, A REVERED ADMIRAL, AND
SOMEONE SENATOR McCAIN KNEW AS 
WELL.
YOU SEE DIANNE FEINSTEIN, AND 
JON KARL JOINING US NOW.
IT'S A COLLECTION OF THE FACES 
WE KNOW IN WASHINGTON, AND 
SENATOR McCAIN HAD TO WORK WITH 
AND FIGHT WITH DURING HIS TIME 
IN THE SENATE.
>> Reporter: I'M STRUCK THINKING
OF A LINE THAT McCAIN OFTEN 
USED.
HE SAID THAT HE NEVER -- HE WAS 
NEVER ELECTED MR. CONGENIALITY 
OF THE SENATE.
HE LOVED TO FIGHT, AND IN HIS 
LAST BOOK, "THE RESTLESS WAVE," 
HE SAID HIS ENJOYMENT OF A FIGHT
WAS IN HIS CHANCES TO WINNING 
THE FIGHT.
WHEN I LOOK AND I SEE THESE 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THESE 
SENATORS OF BOTH PARTIES, SOME 
OF WHOM FOUGHT MIGHTILY WITH 
McCAIN COME IN AND SHOW RESPECT 
FOR SOMEBODY WHO, YOU KNOW, 
McCAIN -- AND THERE YOU SEE VICE
PRESIDENT PENCE COMING IN 
REPRESENTING THE WHITE HOUSE AT 
THIS CEREMONY.
McCAIN WAS SOMEBODY WHO ALWAYS 
SEEMED TO BE IN A HURRY.
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER HAD A TOUGH 
RE-ELECTION.
HE WON -- HE WON IN ARIZONA.
HE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A SCARE 
LAST TIME AROUND, BUT ULTIMATELY
HE WON EVERY RACE BY TEN POINTS 
OR MORE.
BUT HE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A GUY 
THAT WAS IN A HURRY.
YOU HAD TO ALMOST KIND OF SPRINT
TO KEEP UP WITH HIM WHILE 
WALKING THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF
THE CAPITOL.
HE WANTED TO DO THINGS.
HE WANTED TO -- AS HE WOULD SAY 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ENCOURAGE 
US TO DEDICATE OUR LIVES TO A 
CAUSE GREATER THAN OURSELVES, 
AND HE FELT THAT HE HAD SURVIVED
THAT HORRIFIC ORDEAL IN VIETNAM.
HE WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE HIS 
TIME NOW THAT HE HAD BEEN GIVEN 
THIS -- WHAT HE SAW AS A GREAT 
HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE STATE 
OF ARIZONA IN THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE.
HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THE MOST OF
IT, EVEN IF THAT MEANT CLASHING 
AND RUNNING A BIT LIKE A BULL IN
A CHINA SHOP IN THE SENATE, AND 
GOING UP AGAINST HIS COLLEAGUES 
IN BOTH PARTIES.
HE WAS GOING TO GET THINGS DONE.
AND FIGHT.
HE LOVED TO FIGHT, AND HERE THEY
ALL ARE, THOSE -- HIS FORMER 
SPARRING PARTNERS AND FRIENDS.
SHOWING THEIR RESPECT.
>> AND HERE IT IS.
THE CASKET CARRYING THE SENATOR 
JOHN McCAIN AS HE ENTERS THE 
ROTUNDA AS HE IS ABOUT TO LIE IN
STATE.
>> AND LOOK AT THIS IMAGE RIGHT 
HERE.
HIS FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, 
THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEART.
YOU MAY HAVE DISAGREED WITH 
SENATOR McCAIN'S POLITICS.
YOU MAY HAVE AGREED WITH THEM, 
BUT YOU COULD NEVER DOUBT THIS 
MAN WAS A PATRIOT, COKIE 
ROBERTS.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, AND 
LOOKING AT THAT LINEUP OF 
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS AND SOME OF THEIR WIVES
WAS REALLY QUITE STRIKING, BUT 
THIS WHOLE CEREMONY OF THE ROLE 
OF THE MILITARY IS ALSO 
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY 
IMPRESSIVE, OF COURSE.
BUT SO APPROPRIATE FOR JOHN 
McCAIN WHO WAS OF COURSE, NOT 
ONLY SUCH A HERO HIMSELF IN THE 
MILITARY, BUT THE CHILD OF THE 
MILITARY.
YOU SEE SITTING IN THE LAST 
PICTURE YOU SAW SITTING IN A 
WHEE
WHEELCHAIR, SENATOR TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH WHO WAS SEVERELY 
INJURED IN THE IRAQ WAR, LOSING 
LEGS AND AN ARM, AND SHE HAS 
TALKED ABOUT WHAT AN INSPIRATION
JOHN McCAIN WAS TO HER, AND HOW 
HE ALWAYS REACHED OUT TO HER AND
ENCOURAGED HER EVEN THOUGH SHE 
WAS A DEMOCRAT BECAUSE HE 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE HAD 
SUFFERED.
>> AND COKIE, AS WE WATCH THE 
CAPITOL POLICE HONOR GUARD TAKE 
OVER FOR THE NAVY HONOR GUARD, 
I'M REMINDED OF HOW MANY THINGS 
HAPPENED IN SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN'S LIFE FOR THIS MOMENT 
RIGHT HERE TO HAVE NOT HAPPENED.
HE GRADUATED AT THE BOTTOM OF 
HIS CLASS AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY, 
AND TALKED ABOUT SHOT DOWN THE.
HE GOT INTO POLITICS, AND LED AN
INCREDIBLE LIFE.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> WE GIVE YOU THANKS, ALMIGHTY 
GOD, FOR THE APPEARANCE OF US, 
GREAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE AS
INSPIRATIONS FOR ALL AMERICANS 
TO BE THEIR BEST IN SERVICE TO 
GOD, COUNTRY AND NEIGHBOR.
THIS DAY, WE HONOR A TRUE 
AMERICAN HERO, SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN.
HE DEDICATED HIS ENTIRE LIFE TO 
PUBLIC SERVICE AS A VOCATION, 
FIRST IN THE MILITARY, AND THEN 
IN ELECTED OFFICE.
HE PLACED HIMSELF DIRECTLY IN 
HARM'S WAY DURING THE VIETNAM 
WAR AND HIS GREAT SACRIFICE OF 
PERSONAL FREEDOM IS WELL KNOWN.
AS A SENATOR, HE SERVED WITH 
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY, WORKING 
BOTH WITH THOSE WITH WHOM HE 
AGREED AND MANY WITH WHOM HE DID
NOT.
HIS WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK THE 
TRUTH AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT, EVEN 
WHEN IT WAS NOT POLITICALLY 
EXPEDIENT TO DO SO PROVED TO BE 
A RARE PHENOMENON.
FOR THAT REASON, IT WAS ALL THE 
MORE PRECIOUS.
AS WE CONTINUE THIS CELEBRATION 
OF HONOR GRANT THAT ALL WHO 
ATTEND TO THESE PROCEEDINGS 
MIGHT TRANSCEND SMALLNESS AND 
LIMITATION AND EMERGE AS PEOPLE 
DESIROUS OF BEING OUR BEST 
SELVES IN SERVICE TO ALL OF OUR 
BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS YOU 
MIGHT CALL EACH OF US TO BE.
DEAR LORD, THANK YOU FOR 
INSPIRING SUCH GREATNESS IN 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND CONTINUE
TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA.
AMEN.
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MR. 
SPEAKER, COLLEAGUES, 
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND THE 
McCAIN FAMILY, IT'S AN HONOR TO 
WELCOME YOU THIS MORNING.
WE GATHER TO RECOGNIZE A GREAT 
LOSS AND CELEBRATE A GREAT LIFE.
WE CELEBRATE SIX DECADES OF 
DEVOTION TO THE AMERICAN IDEA 
AND THE CAUSE OF HUMAN FREEDOM.
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HWILL 
CONTINUE TO MARVEL AT THE MAN 
WHO LIES BEFORE US.
A COCKY, HANDSOME, NAVAL AVIATOR
WHO BARELY SCRAPED THROUGH 
SCHOOL AND THEN FOUGHT FOR 
FREEDOM IN THE SKIES.
WHO WITNESSED OUR HOUSE VALUES 
EVEN THROUGH TERRIBLE TORTURE 
AND BECAME A GENERATIONAL LEADER
IN OUR UNITED STATES SENATE 
WHERE OUR NATION AIRS ITS GREAT 
DEBATES.
NOW THAT IS A GENTLE WAY TO 
DESCRIBE OHOW JOHN APPROACHED TE
WORK OF A SENATOR.
I HAVE LONG JOKED THAT THE HOUSE
PROBABLY NEEDED GROUP THERAPY 
AFTER JOHN WAS FINISHED WITH 
THEM.
LET'S JUST SAY THERE WERE TIMES 
WHEN SOME OF HIS SENATE 
COLLEAGUES WERE TEMPTED TO 
PERFORM A SUPPORT GROUP OF OUR 
OWN.
HE TREATED EVERY ISSUE WITH THE 
INTENSITY THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS 
DESERVED.
HE WOULD FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL 
FOR HIS VISION OF THE COMMON 
GOOD DEPENDING ON THE ISSUE, YOU
KNEW JOHN WOULD EITHER BE YOUR 
STAUNCHEST ALLY OR YOUR MOST 
STUBBORN OPPONENT.
AS
AT ANY MOMENT HE MIGHT BE 
PREPARING AN ELOQUENT REFLECTION
ON HUMAN LIBERTY OR A 
DEVASTATING JOKE SERVED UP WITH 
HIS SIGNATURE CACKLE AND THAT 
JOHN McCAIN GLINT IN HIS EYE.
HE HAD AMERICA'S FIGHTING 
SPIRIT, OUR NOBLE IDEALISM, OUR 
SOLEMN PATRIOTISM AND OUR 
SLIGHTLY IRREVERENT STREAK, ALL 
ROLLED INTO ONE.
I WILL MISS A DEAR FRIEND WHOSE 
SMILE REMINDED US THAT SERVICE 
IS A PRIVILEGE, AND WHOSE SCARS 
REMINDED US OF THE GREAT COST 
THAT BRAVE SOULS PAY FOR OUR 
FREEDOM.
JOHN FELT LIKE FAMILY, BUT OF 
COURSE, IT IS CINDY AND ROBERTA 
AND JOE AND DOUG, ANDY, SIDNEY, 
MEGHAN, JACK, JIMMY AND BRIDGET 
WHO CAN TRULY CALL THIS MAN 
THEIR OWN.
ON BEHALF OF THE SENATE AND THE 
ENTIRE NATION, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR LENDING HIM TO US 
LONGER THAN WE HAD A RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING HIM 
WHILE HE SUPPORTED US.
HALF A WORLD AWAY, WEARING OUR 
NATION'S UNIFORM, JOHN McCAIN 
STOOD UP FOR EVERY VALUE THAT 
THIS CAPITOL BUILDING 
REPRESENTS.
THEN HE BROUGHT THAT SAME 
PATRIOTISM INSIDE ITS WALLS TO 
ADVOCATE FOR OUR SERVICE 
MEMBERS, OUR VETERANS AND OUR 
MORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD.
SO IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT TODAY 
NEAR THE END OF HIS LONG JOURNEY
JOHN LIES HERE IN THIS GREAT 
HALL UNDER THIS MIGHTY DOME LIKE
OTHER AMERICAN HEROES BEFORE 
HIM.
HERE AS A RESTLESS WAVE 
APPROACHES THE SHORES OF 
ETERNITY, WE THANK GOD FOR 
GIVING THIS COUNTRY JOHN McCAIN.
>> ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 
NATION AND ON BEHALF OF 
CONGRESS, I WANT TO BEGIN BY 
GIVING THANKS TO THE McCAIN 
FAMILY.
FOR YOUR MANY YEARS OFF SERVICE 
TO OUR COUNTRY.
WE SHARE YOUR ANGUISH IN LOSING 
THIS GREAT MAN.
RARELY DOES THIS GLORIOUS 
ROTUNDA FALL SILENT AT THIS 
HOUR.
ON A DAY LIKE THIS, JOHN WOULD 
USUALLY BE BOUNDING THIS WAY OR 
THAT WAY, RIGHT THROUGH HERE.
VISITORS TURNING TO EACH OTHER, 
ASKING IF THAT'S WHO THEY THINK 
IT IS, BUT IN THIS QUIET HOUR, 
WE ARE LEFT TO PONDER HOW HIS 
LIFE SPEAKS TO US.
JOHN McCAIN DESERVES TO BE 
REMEMBERED AS HE WISHED TO BE 
REMEMBERED, A POATRIOT WHO SERVD
HIS COUNTRY.
A MAN YES OF THE SENATE, BUT 
ALSO A MAN OF THE HOUSE.
A NAVY MAN, A FAMILY MAN.
A MAN WHO MADE AN ENORMOUS 
DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF 
COUNTLESS PEOPLE.
A MAN OF CONVICTION.
A MAN OF STATE.
THERE IS A LINE FROM HIS 
FAREWELL STATEMENT THAT REALLY 
JUST GRABBED ME.
OUR IDENTITIES AND SENSE OF 
WORTH ARE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED, BUT
ENLARGED BY SERVING BIG CAUSES 
BIGGER THAN OURSELVES.
THAT'S JOHN McCAIN.
HOW FITTING AND HOW TRUE.
WHAT STANDS OUT ABOUT JOHN 
McCAIN IS WHAT HE STOOD FOR.
THE RICH BLESSINGS THAT ONLY 
FREEDOM CAN BESTOW.
THE SENSE OF PURPOSE THAT A 
BATTLE JOINED CAN BRING, THE 
COMMON HUMANITY THAT BURNS IN 
EACH OF OUR HEARTS.
HEMINGWAY ONCE WROTE, THE WORLD 
BREAKS EVERYONE AND AFTERWARD, 
MANY ARE STRONG AT THE BROKEN 
PLACES.
NO ONE, NO ONE WAS STRONGER AT 
THE BROKEN PLACES THAN JOHN 
McCAIN.
THE BROKENNESS WAS HIS BAEST.
HE NEVER LOST THE TIME, OR THE 
POLITICAL LIFE SANDS AWAY.
I MYSELF FROM TIME TO TIME, 
FOUND MYSELF ON THE RECEIVING 
END OF JOHN'S DISTINCT BRAND OF 
CONDOR.
HAPPILY SO.
I REMEMBER THINKING MORE THAN 
ONCE, YEAH.
HE REALLY DOES TALK LIKE A 
SAILOR, BUT YOU SEE WITH JOHN, 
IT WAS NEVER FEIGNED 
DISAGREEMENT.
THE MAN DIDN'T FEIGN ANYTHING.
HE JUST RELISHED THE FIGHT.
HE SHOWED US THAT IN THE ARENA, 
THE HONEST BACK AND FORTH, 
THAT'S WHERE THE CAUSE GETS 
BIGGER.
THAT'S WHERE THE TRIUMPH IS ALL 
THE SWEETER.
WE GET STRONGER AT THE BROKEN 
PLACES.
HOE
THOUGH THE HIGHEST OFFICE ELUDED
HIM, HE DETAINED WHAT IS FAR 
MORE ENDURING, THE ABIDING 
AFFECTION OF HIS FELLOW 
CITIZENS.
AND AN EXAMPLE FOR FUTURE 
GENERATIONS.
SO I THINK AHEAD NOW.
I THINK AHEAD OF THE DAY WHEN I 
LIKE SO MANY, WILL BRING MY OWN 
CHILDREN AND PERHAPS THEIR 
CHILDREN TO THAT HALLOWED LAWN 
IN ANNAPOLIS.
I THINK ABOUT THAT.
I THINK ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT SAY 
TO THEM.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BRAVEST SOULS
OUR NATION HAS EVER PRODUCED.
HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO YOUR 
PART, I HOPE YOU DO IT THE WAY 
HE DID, WITH ENERGY AND URGENCY,
PLAYING FOR KEEPS, NEVER BACK ON
YOUR HEELS.
NEVER LETTING PRINCIPLE YIELD TO
EXPEDIENCE, RESISTING THE FALSE 
ALLURE OF THE FLEETING AND 
BATTENING DOWN THE HATCHES WHEN 
THINGS GET ROUGH, AND ALWAYS, 
ALWAYS HAVING A REALLY GOOD 
STORY TO TELL.
TODAY OUR NATION BOWS IN GRIEF, 
BUT HERE UNDER THIS WORK, AND IN
THE GAZE OF THE GREATS, FWHERE 
SOLDIERS KNOWN AND UNKNOWN HAVE 
LAID BEFORE, WE HAVE THIS 
BEAUTIFUL THING, THE CHANCE TO 
DO FOR THIS MAN WHAT HE DID FOR 
US, TO STAND UP.
TO STAND UP AND TO EMBRACE THE 
CAUSE OF HIS LIFE.
NO ONE OF US CAN FULFILL THIS 
CHARGE, BUT ALL OF US SURE CAN 
TRY.
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS, ALL OF 
THIS, IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
GOD BLESS JOHN McCAIN, AND GOD 
BLESS THE COUNTRY HE SO DEARLY 
LOVED.
>> AND NOW VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE.
>> LEADER McCONNELL, SPEAKER 
RYAN, LEADER SCHUMER, LEADER 
PELOSI.
DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS, MEMBERS OF THE 
CABINET, MEMBERS OF OUR ARMED 
FORCES AND HONORED GUESTS AND 
MOST OF ALL, TO THE McCAIN 
FAMILY.
TO CINDY, HIS CHILDREN AND MRS. 
ROBERTA McCAIN.
IT IS DEEPLY HUMBLING TO STAND 
BEFORE YOU TODAY AT THE UNITED 
STATES CAPITOL TO COMMEMORATE 
THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF AN 
AMERICAN PATRIOT, SENATOR JOHN 
McCAIN.
THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO BE 
HERE ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 
NATION TO PAY A DEBT OF HONOR 
AND RESPECT TO A MAN WHO SERVED 
OUR COUNTRY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE.
IN UNIFORM AND IN PUBLIC OFFICE.
IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE.
IN THE LONG HISTORY OF OUR 
NATION, ONLY 30 AMERICANS HAVE 
LAID IN STATE HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES CAPITOL ROTUNDA.
TODAY AS A REFLECTION OF THE 
ESTEEM IN WHICH HIS COLLEAGUES 
AND OUR COUNTRY HOLD HIM, 
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN JOINS THOSE 
RANKS.
THE SON AND THE GRANDSON OF 
FOUR-STAR ADMIRALS, JOHN CAME 
FROM A FAMILY THAT PRIZED 
MILITARY SERVICE.
HE ENTERED THE UNITED STATES 
NAVAL ACADEMY WHEN HE WAS JUST 
17 YEARS OLD.
HIS SERVICE AS A NAVAL AVIATOR 
TOOK HIM AROUND THE WORLD AND 
EVENTUALLY TO THE WAR IN VI
VIETNAM.
IT WAS THERE ON HIS 23rd BOMBING
RUN THAT JOHN WAS SHOT DOWN AND 
CAPTURED.
REFUSING EARLY RELEASE FOR THE 
SAKE OF HIS COMRADES, HE ENDURED
5 1/2 YEARS OF CONFINEMENT AND 
TORTURE.
THEN AS NOW, AMERICANS MARVELLED
AT THE IRON WILL OF JOHN McCAIN,
BUT CAPTIVITY DID NOT DIMINISH 
JOHN'S SENSE OF CALLING OR HIS 
COMMITMENT TO MISSION.
AS HE WOULD LATER SAY, I FELL IN
LOVE WITH ANY COUNTRY WHEN I WAS
A PRISONER IN SOMEONE ELSE'S.
AFTER HE MADE IT HOME, JOHN 
TRADED SERVICE IN THE UNIFORM OF
THE UNITED STATES FOR SERVICE IN
CONGRESS, EXCHANGING THE RANK OF
CAPTAIN FOR CONGRESSMAN, AND 
LATER SENATOR.
FOR 35 YEARS, JOHN SERVED IN 
THESE VERY HALLS UNDER THIS VERY
DOME.
AND HE FOUGHT FOR WHAT HE 
BELIEVED IN.
IN MY YEARS IN CONGRESS AND AS 
VICE PRESIDENT, WE DIDN'T ALWAYS
AGREE EITHER, AND HE ALMOST 
ALWAYS NOTICED, BUT HIS SUPPORT 
FOR LIMITED GOVERNMENT, FOR TAX 
REFORM AND SUPPORT FOR OUR ARMED
FORCES SURELY LEFT OUR NATION 
MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE SECURE,
AND HE WILL BE MISSED.
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID 
YESTERDAY, WE RESPECT HIS 
SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY.
LIKE MANY OF YOU GATHERED HERE, 
I ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF 
TRAVELING WITH SENATOR McCAIN TO
VISIT OUR TROOPS OVERSEAS.
EARLIER THIS WEEK, I TOLD CINDY 
OF A TIME ON A TRIP THROUGH IRAQ
AFTER ANOTHER 18-HOUR DAY.
WHEN I WAS LITERALLY FALLING 
ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF A DINNER
WITH IRAQI OFFICIALS, AFTER THE 
DINNER JOHN WHO WAS MORE THAN 20
YEARS OLDER THAN ME WALKED UP, 
PUT HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND 
SAID, MIKE, WE HAVE GOT A FEW 
MORE MEETINGS TONIGHT, BUT WHY 
DON'T YOU TURN IN?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE SOME
REST.
THANKS, JOHN.
HONESTLY, SEEING HIM DOWN RANGE,
I NEVER TRAVELED WITH A 
COLLEAGUE WHO WAS BETTER TO OUR 
ENLISTED OR HARDER ON OUR 
GENERALS.
JOHN McCAIN LOVED THE MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO SERVED IN THE UNIFORM 
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND HE WAS
A CHAMPION OF OUR ANTICRMED FOR 
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER.
IN EVERY GENERATION, THERE ARE 
THOSE WHO PUT COUNTRY FIRST, WHO
PRIZE SERVICE AHEAD OF SELF, WHO
SUMMON IDEALISM FROM A CYNICAL 
AGE.
JOHN McCAIN WAS SUCH A MAN.
TODAY, HE LIES IN THE PLACE 
WHERE HE SERVED TO THE LAST, THE
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.
SOON HE WILL GO TO REST ON THE 
GROUNDS WHERE HE SERVED FIRST, 
THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY.
THE EYES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WILL BE UPON HIM AS HE GOES, AND
SO TOO WILL THEIR PRAYERS FOR 
HIM, AND ESPECIALLY FOR HIS 
BELOVED FAMILY.
GATHERED HERE TODAY, AND WE WILL
PRAY THAT THOSE WHO MOURN SHALL 
BE COMFORTED.
SO WE MOURN WITH THOSE WHO MOURN
AND WE GRIEVE WITH THOSE WHO 
GRIEVE, BUT WE DO NOT GRIEVE 
LIKE THOSE WHO HAVE NO HOPE 
BECAUSE JOHN McCAIN, LIKE 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, HELD FIRM
TO THAT HOPE FROM AN OLD HYMN 
THAT BECAME THE TITLE OF A BOOK 
HE WROTE SOME 20 YEARS 
AGO, "FAITH OF OUR FATHERS."
THE FULL STANZA OF THAT HYMN 
READS, FAITH OF OUR FATHERS, 
LIVING STILL.
IN SPITE OF DUNGEON, FIRE AND 
SWORD.
OH, HOW OUR HEARTS BEAT HIGH 
WITH JOY, WHENEVER HE HEAR THAT 
GLORIOUS WORD.
JOHN McCAIN HELD FIRM TO THAT 
FAITH, THE FAITH OF HIS FATHERS.
THROUGH DUNGEONS, FIRE AND 
SWORD, AND HE HELD FAST TO HIS 
FAITH IN AMERICA THROUGH SIX 
DECADES OF SERVICE.
WE GATHER HERE TODAY TO HONOR AN
AMERICAN PATRIOT WHO SERVED A 
CAUSE GREATER THAN HIMSELF, AND 
WE GATHER HERE REMEMBERING A MAN
WHO KNEW HOW HE WANTED TO BE 
REMEMBERED.
SO LET ME SAY TO ALL THOSE 
GATHERED AND HIS BELOVED FAMILY,
ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL NATION, 
WE WILL EVER REMEMBER THAT JOHN 
McCAIN SERVED HIS COUNTRY AND 
JOHN McCAIN SERVED HIS COUNTRY 
HONO
HONORABLY.
MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF JOHN
McCAIN.
MAY GOD COMFORT HIS FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS, AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA.
>> WE WERE JUST LISTENING TO 
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE 
DELIVER HIS REMARKS AT THE 
CEREMONY THERE IN THE ROTUNDA.
THE VICE PRESIDENT SAYING, 
QUOTE, HE WILL BE MISSED, AND 
SENDING THIS MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT.
WE RESPECT HIS SERVICE TO THE 
COUNTRY.
WE NOW EXPECT SENATOR MITCH 
McCONNELL AND CHUCK SCHUMER TO 
BOTH TOGETHER AND IN A SIGN OF 
BIPARTISANSHIP -- THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR McCAIN 
WANTED.
IT BREAKS PROTOCOL.
HE WANTED THEM TO BOTH LAY THIS 
WREATH TOGETHER AS A TESTAMENT 
TO HIS FIGHT TO SOMETIMES 
COMPROMISE AND WORK TOGETHER IN 
THE SENATE.
SENATOR SCHUMER OF COURSE, ALSO 
A VERY GOOD FRIEND TO SENATOR 
McCAIN, AND PAUL RYAN WILL NOW 
DELIVER A WREATH FROM THE HOUSE.
SENATOR McCAIN SERVED TWO TERMS 
BEFORE HE ENTERED THE SENATE.
THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER, NANCY
PELOSI, WILL ALSO BE JOINING THE
HOUSE SPEAKER.
AND NOW REPRESENTING THE WHITE 
HOUSE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE
AND HIS WIFE, KAREN.
I WANT TO BRING BACK IN OUR 
JONATHAN KARL AND COKIE ROBERTS.
AS I WAS WATCHING THIS, I WAS 
THINKING, WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAD 
INTO THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND.
FOR MANY AMERICANS, EVEN THOUGH 
THERE WILL BE MORE CEREMONIES, 
THIS WILL BE THE LAST MOMENT 
THEY SAY.
THEY SAW PEOPLE FROM BOTH SIDES 
OF THE AISLE, DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS COMING TOGETHER TO 
LAY DOWN THAT WREATH, AND OF 
COURSE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE AND NOT THE PRESIDENT TO 
REPRESENT THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Reporter: AND I THINK, TOM, A
MEMORIAL, A REMEMBRANCE THAT 
JOHN McCAIN WOULD SAY, GREATER 
THAN HIMSELF.
THIS WAS ABOUT SOMETHING LARGER 
THAN JOHN McCAIN, AND I SAW 
SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER SEEN 
BEFORE.
I SAW MITCH McCONNELL CHOKING UP
AS HE SPOKE ABOUT JOHN McCAIN, 
SOMEBODY HE FOUGHT WITH 
BITTERLY, ESPECIALLY ON CAMPAIGN
FINANCE REFORM, WHICH WAS THE 
SIGNATURE ISSUE FOR JOHN McCAIN.
McCONNELL WAS THE GUY ON THE 
OTHER SIDE, AND TO SEE THE WAY 
HE TOUCHED MITCH McCONNELL, YOU 
KNOW, A HARDENED POLITICAL 
FIGURE.
I JUST WANT TO -- IT'S A CLOSING
THOUGHT, TOM.
READ YOU SOMETHING THAT McCAIN 
WROTE AT THE CLOSE OF HIS LAST 
BOOK.
HE SAID, I HAVE LIVED LIVES -- I
HAVE LIVED VERY WELL.
I HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF ALL 
COMFORTS.
I HAVE BEEN AS LONELY AS A 
PERSON CAN BE, AND I HAVE 
ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF HEROES.
I SUFFERED THE DEEPEST DESPAIR, 
AND EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST 
EXULTATION.
I WISH YOU ALL GOOD COMPANY, AND
LIVES AS LUCKY AS MINE.
>> AN INCREDIBLE STATEMENT.
COKIE, I WAS STRUCK BY HOUSE 
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.
HE SAID, WE GET STRONGER AT THE 
BROKEN PLACES, TALKING ABOUT 
SENATOR McCAIN, HIS TIME IN THAT
P.O.W. CAMP, BUT THEN HE ALSO 
SAID, SENATOR McCAIN DIDN'T WIN 
THE PRESIDENCY, BUT HE WILL BE 
AN EXAMPLE OF FUTURE 
GENERATIONS, TO FUTURE 
GENERATIONS. 
>> THAT WAS ANOTHER BROKEN 
PLACE, AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS
A VERY ELOQUENT TESTIMONY, AND 
LOOKING AT THIS, SEEING JOHN 
McCAIN'S 106-YEAR-OLD MOTHER 
THROUGHOUT THIS, NOTHING IS 
HARDER THAN TO LOSE THE CHILD, 
NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE, AND 
HOW OLD HE WAS.
THIS MUST BE TERRIBLY PAINFUL, 
BUT ALSO THE INCREDIBLE 
GATHERING THERE.
NOT JUST OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
OF BOTH PARTIES AND PAST MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS IN BOTH PARTIES, BUT
CABINET MEMBERS, FORMER CABINET 
MEMBERS FROM SEVERAL 
ADMINISTRATIONS, SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES.
AS I LOOKED AROUND THAT ROOM, 
ALL OF OFFICIALDOM OF THE LAST 
30 YEARS WAS GATHERED IN THAT 
ROT
ROTUNDA, AND THEY WILL LEAVE, 
AND THE PUBLIC WILL COME.
THAT'S THE MOST FITTING 
TESTIMONY.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO HE 
SERVED FOR SO LONG AND SO NOBLY 
WILL NOW HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO 
COME IN ONE BY ONE AND SAY 
GOOD-BYE TO JOHN McCAIN.
>> JON AND COKIE, OUR THANKS TO 
YOU, AND OUR THANKS TO OUR 
VIEWERS WITNESSING THIS MOMENT 
IN HISTORY WITH US.
WHEN WE STARTED THIS BROADCAST, 
JOHN McCAIN NEVER BECAME A 
PRESIDENT, BUT TODAY HE IS BEING
TREATED LIKE HE SHOULD, LIKE HE 
DESERVED A HEAD OF STATE.
WE'LL RETURN TO REGULAR 
PROGRAMMING NOW.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON "WORLD 
NEWS TONIGHT" AND JOIN US 
TOMORROW MORNING WHEN GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS LEADS OUR FULL 
COVERAGE OF THE MEMORIAL SERVICE
FOR SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AT THE 
NATIONAL CATHEDRAL.
WE END NOW WITH CINDY McCAIN 
LOOKING OVER THE CASKET OF HER 
HUSBAND, SENATOR JOHN McCAIN.
THAT'S 106-YEAR-OLD ROBERTA 
McCAIN SAYING GOOD-BYE TO HER 
SON RIGHT THERE, AS THE McCAIN 
FAMILY SAYS GOOD-BYE TO THEIR 
PATRIARCH THERE IN THE ROTUNDA 
AT THE U.S. CAPITOL.
THIS WRAPS UP OUR COVERAGE.
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON "WORLD 
NEWS TONIGHT."
WE THANK YOU FOR WITNESSING THIS
MOMENT WITH US.
I'M TOM LLAMAS.
HAVE A GREAT DAY.
