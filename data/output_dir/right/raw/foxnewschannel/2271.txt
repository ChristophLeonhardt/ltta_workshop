1
00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:04,950
JESSE WATTERS, DANA PERINO.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,623
"THE FIVE" ."

3
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:13,058
SATURDAY WAS THE WHITE HOUSE

4
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:13,659
CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.

5
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:15,360
HERE'S A CLIP.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,699
>> IT IS A TRASH FIRE.

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,501
>> Greg: WE COULD STOP THERE.

8
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,303
EVERYTHING WENT AS PLANNED.

9
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:26,972
THE COMEDIAN, ON DILUTED LEFTIST

10
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:29,708
PLUCKED FROM DAILY SHOW ASSEMBLY

11
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:30,876
LINE.

12
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,476
UNLOADED ON THE WHITE HOUSE.

13
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:34,079
LIKE A TORTOISE ON CRUTCHES, YOU

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,013
COULD SEE THE JOKES LIMPING

15
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:35,681
TOWARD YOU.

16
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:39,284
THE DINNER IS OLD NEWS, AN OF

17
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,220
SELF CONGRATULATIONS, SELFIES,

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,489
PREDICTABLE BARBS.

19
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,359
>> I HAVE TO SAY I AM A LITTLE

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,995
STARSTRUCK.

21
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:52,898
I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LYDIA IN THE

22
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:53,699
HANDMAID'S TALE.

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:54,499
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SARAH.

24
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:58,336
I THINK SHE IS VERY RESOURCEFUL.

25
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:02,974
LIKE SHE BURNS FACTS AND USES

26
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,176
THE ASH TO CREATE A PERFECT

27
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:06,078
SMOKY EYE.

28
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:07,579
MAYBE SHE IS BORN WITH IT.

29
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,916
MAYBE IT'S LIES.

30
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,084
PROBABLY LIVES.

31
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:14,119
I AM NEVER SURE WHAT TO CALL

32
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,088
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS.

33
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:17,723
IS IT SARAH SANDERS?

34
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:20,859
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS?

35
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,995
WHAT IS UNCLE TOM BUT FOR WHITE

36
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,664
WOMEN WHO DISAPPOINT OTHER WHITE

37
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:25,964
WOMEN?

38
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:27,299
>> Greg: WOLF REMINDS US YOU

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,034
CAN SMEAR WOMEN AS LONG AS YOU

40
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,135
ON THE RIGHT.

41
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:31,737
THE MEDIA CALLS IT A ROAST.

42
00:01:31,737 --> 00:01:32,437
IF  IF YOU DID IT COME IT WOULDB

43
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:32,671
IF  IF YOU DID IT COME IT WOULDE

44
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:37,709
CALLED MISOGYNY.

45
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,478
PROGRESSIVES PLAY BY DIFFERENT

46
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:39,878
RULES.

47
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:40,779
TAKE JOY REID.

48
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,081
WHATEVER SHE WRITES WILL BE

49
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,549
EXCUSED.

50
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,151
BEING ON THE LEFT EXCUSES

51
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:46,551
EVERYTHING.

52
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:49,888
YOU CAN DRIVE GIRLS INTO THE

53
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:51,490
DRINK OR RUN THE CLAN AND STILL

54
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,358
SIT IN THE SENATE AS LONG AS

55
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,127
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT.

56
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:56,228
THE COMMENTS DEFENDERS WILL SAY

57
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:58,330
CIAMPA SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT

58
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,297
WOMEN TOO.

59
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:00,098
YOU ARE RIGHT.

60
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:01,533
HE SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT

61
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,234
EVERYONE.

62
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:03,735
BUT IF HE WASN'T PRESIDENT AND

63
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:04,936
MARCO RUBIO WAS, DO YOU THINK

64
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:08,306
MICHELLE WOULD BE ANY NICER TO

65
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:09,407
RUBIO?

66
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:10,241
HE IS PRO-LIFE.

67
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,711
SHE IS THIS.

68
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:20,352
>> MIKE PENCE IS ANTICHOICE.

69
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:24,289
HE THINKS ABORTION IS MURDER.

70
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,023
BUT DON'T KNOCK IT UNTIL WE'VE

71
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:27,726
TRIED IT.

72
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:28,894
>> Greg: MAYBE THAT'S WHAT

73
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:31,963
BRIAN SELTZER CONSIDERS BRAVE

74
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:33,098
MATERIAL.

75
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:34,933
YEAH, CIAMPA SAID BAD THINGS BUT

76
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:41,106
HE CRUSHED ISIS AND -- I WILL

77
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:42,007
TAKE THE TRAY OFF EVEN IF I HAVE

78
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:46,545
TO LISTEN TO BAD JOKES.

79
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:47,712
KIMBERLY, I GO TO YOU.

80
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:51,483
I BELIEVE YOU FEEL STRONGLY.

81
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:54,219
>> YOU ARE MONITORING ME ALL

82
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,488
WEEKEND.

83
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:58,323
>> Greg: I WAS OUTSIDE YOUR

84
00:02:58,323 --> 00:02:58,623
HOUSE.

85
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:03,228
SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

86
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:03,962
I FELT THIS WAS SO MEAN-SPIRITED

87
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:05,397
THAT IT WASN'T ANYTHING THAT WAS

88
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:06,498
COMEDIC.

89
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:09,067
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED

90
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,035
FOR HER SAYING THESE TYPE OF

91
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:11,970
THINGS THAT WERE DIRECTLY

92
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,938
TARGETED.

93
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:13,738
I THINK OF THE MAJORITY OF WHAT

94
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:18,743
SHE HAD TO SAY -- THIS ISN'T

95
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:20,512
ADVANCING THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

96
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:22,113
THIS IS PROFFERING CRUELTY.

97
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:22,914
IF YOU ARE SITTING IN A CHAIR

98
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:26,051
LIKE THAT TO LISTEN TO THAT, AND

99
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:26,751
EVERYBODY, I GUESS SOME PEOPLE

100
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:30,822
LAUGHED BUT TO GO ON IN THIS

101
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:32,924
WAY, I THOUGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY

102
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,125
TERRIBLE.

103
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:34,826
WE WERE ALL INVITED.

104
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,329
WE DIDN'T GO.

105
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:37,929
YOU WENT.

106
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,732
I THINK YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE OF

107
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:41,533
THE FIVE OF US.

108
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,835
JUAN WILL SAY WITH HIS PERSONAL

109
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:46,872
EXPENSE WAS THERE AND LISTENING.

110
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:47,706
SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFERENT.

111
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,441
AT HOME, AND WE WATCHED IT SO

112
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,476
MANY TIMES MY FELT SO SAD FOR

113
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:52,510
HER.

114
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,578
SARAH CONDUCTED HERSELF

115
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,480
BEAUTIFULLY AND HANDLED HERSELF

116
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,682
WELL.

117
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:00,685
TO SIT THERE AND LISTEN, SO

118
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:01,286
MEAN-SPIRITED, BULLYING.

119
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:01,820
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

120
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,122
I WOULDN'T LIKE IT IF SHE SAID

121
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:07,559
THAT ABOUT A MAN, A WOMAN, A

122
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,493
CHILD.

123
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,728
WHAT DID SARAH SANDERS EVER DO

124
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,930
TO HURT TO DESERVE THOSE

125
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,398
PERSONAL ATTACKS ON THAT LEVEL

126
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:14,299
OF VITRIOL?

127
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,033
SHE SHOULD BE HORRIBLE ABOUT

128
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,535
HERSELF WHEN SHE GOES TO BED AND

129
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:18,904
WHEN SHE WAKES UP IN THE

130
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:19,504
MORNING, MICHELLE WOLF.

131
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,908
NOTHING IT WAS -- NOTHING OF IT

132
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:24,109
WAS FUNNY WHATSOEVER.

133
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:25,477
>> Greg: THEY WOULD RESPOND

134
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:27,612
THAT BECAUSE TRUMP WASN'T THERE,

135
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:28,446
SHE BECOMES THE TARGET.

136
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,482
SHE IS THE PROXY.

137
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:31,950
NUMBER TWO, TRUMP HAS SAID

138
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,952
THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE'S FACES

139
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:35,086
TWICE.

140
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:37,455
>> Dana: AND SOME PEOPLE

141
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:37,889
LAUGHED.

142
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,492
ACROSS THE BOARD, I DON'T GET

143
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:40,926
GOOD OR FUNNY.

144
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:41,593
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

145
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:43,795
THIS, IF YOU WANT TO GO THE

146
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:44,896
PRESIDENT WENT TO THE GRIDIRON

147
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:45,997
DINNER AND IT WAS ONE OF THE

148
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,699
FIRST THAT HE'S ATTENDED.

149
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,534
HE BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN.

150
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:50,702
HE WAS VERY FUNNY.

151
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:51,703
HIS SPEECH WAS GREAT.

152
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,104
NANCY PELOSI WAS ONE OF THE

153
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:54,339
SPEAKERS.

154
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:55,273
I THINK THAT NIGHT, AND THEN TOM

155
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,107
COTTON.

156
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,509
USUALLY IF YOU HAVE AN ELECTED

157
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,977
LEADER WHO HAS -- IT'S NOT EASY

158
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:01,513
TO GIVE A SPEECH LIKE THAT.

159
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:02,948
THEY HAVE TO PRACTICE.

160
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:04,516
IT COSTS A LOT BECAUSE I USUALLY

161
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:06,418
FARM IT OUT TO SOME A GREAT

162
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:06,885
SPEECHWRITER.

163
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:07,819
I DON'T PICK WASHINGTON, D.C.,

164
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:08,820
NEEDS TO BRING IN ANYONE FROM

165
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,889
THE OUTSIDE TO DO THIS TYPES OF

166
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:11,356
THINGS.

167
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:12,524
THE GRIDIRON DINNER HAS NEVER

168
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:13,925
DONE IT.

169
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:14,492
IT'S ALWAYS FANTASTIC.

170
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:17,529
THE LINE THEY HAVE, THE GRIDIRON

171
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,097
SINGES BUT IT NEVER BURNS.

172
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:22,133
I HOPE THAT'S THE LAST OF THE

173
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,335
SOUND BITES I HAVE TO HEAR.

174
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,502
HER VOICE IS REALLY, IT REALLY

175
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:25,470
GETS TO ME.

176
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,938
CRAIG FERGUSON WAS ONE OF THE

177
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:27,939
ONLY COMEDIANS THERE THAT I

178
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,107
THOUGHT WAS SO GENTLE.

179
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:31,643
HE BASICALLY MADE FUN OF HIMSELF

180
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:32,677
THE ENTIRE TIME, ANTICOMPLEMENT

181
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:33,745
TO ME.

182
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:35,113
SO I REMEMBER THAT.

183
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,282
SHE TALKS ABOUT THE ABORTION

184
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:37,682
JOKE.

185
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,284
ONE THING YOU COULD SAY IN

186
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:40,018
RESPONSE, AT LEAST SHE CALLED IN

187
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,687
A BABY.

188
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:44,089
>> Greg: THAT WAS THE BIGGEST

189
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:44,522
FLAW.

190
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,191
>> Dana: OH, SO NOW YOU THINK

191
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:47,525
IT'S A BABY.

192
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,995
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK TO THE

193
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:50,362
CONGRESS.

194
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,597
>> Greg: THAT WAS A BIG FLAW

195
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:55,700
AND IT UNDERMINED HER JOKE.

196
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,102
OBAMA GIVES GREAT SPEECHES.

197
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,903
THEY DIDN'T NEED A COMEDIAN.

198
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,905
>> Dana: THE ELECTED LEADERS

199
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,307
WHO GIVE FUNNY SPEECHES, NOT

200
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:03,108
EVEN ELECTED LEADERS.

201
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,943
LAURA BUSH, WHEN SHE DID IT ONE

202
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:06,311
YEAR AT THE WHITE HOUSE

203
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,345
CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER, IT WAS

204
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:08,113
HILARIOUS.

205
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:10,682
WHEN SHE CALLED HERSELF A

206
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:11,282
"DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES."

207
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:11,783
EVERYBODY GOT IT.

208
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:12,550
YOU DON'T NEED TO BRING IN SOME

209
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,120
OF THE FROM THE OUTSIDE.

210
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,822
>> Kimberly: I AGREE WITH YOU,

211
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:18,523
DANA.

212
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,558
WHEN OBAMA SPOKE, HE WAS FUNNY,

213
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:21,326
ENTERTAINING.

214
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:21,793
PEOPLE WOULD GO.

215
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:24,029
NO ONE WANTS TO LISTEN TO THIS

216
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,330
NONSENSE.

217
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,632
>> Greg: NOT A ROUSING

218
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:27,966
SUCCESS.

219
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,134
>> Jesse: ROSEANNE BARR SAID

220
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:30,368
THE FIRST RULE OF COMEDY, YOU

221
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:31,803
DON'T TARGET SOMEONE IN THE

222
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:32,570
AUDIENCE WAS MORE FAMOUS THAN

223
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,138
YOU ARE.

224
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:35,106
YOU WILL LOSE THE ENTIRE CROWD.

225
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:37,142
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

226
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,843
YOU BOOK A C LIST COMEDIAN TO

227
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,312
MAKE FUN OF THE A-LISTERS.

228
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:43,715
LOOK WHO THEY HAVE HAD.

229
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:46,284
SISLEY STRONG, LARRY WILMORE,

230
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:47,685
MICHELLE WOLF, HASSAN MENAGE.

231
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,220
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THESE

232
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,554
PEOPLE.

233
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:50,188
>> Greg: THEY ARE ALL THE

234
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:51,923
DAILY SHOW.

235
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,825
>> Jesse: THEY ARE NOT FAMOUS

236
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:54,192
COMEDIANS.

237
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:58,096
DURING OBAMA, THEY HAD CONAN,

238
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,898
JIMMY KIMMEL, SETH MEYERS, JAY

239
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:00,198
LENO.

240
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:03,868
UNDER BUSH, COLBERT, JAY LENO,

241
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,503
DREW CAROL.

242
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:07,739
>> Dana: THEY SAY THAT COLBERT

243
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:10,108
ENDED UP WITH THE PRIME TIME

244
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,776
LATE SHOW BECAUSE OF THE

245
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:12,177
PERFORMANCE.

246
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:14,312
>> Jesse: IN THAT CASE, I

247
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:14,913
BLAME THE WHITE HOUSE

248
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:16,314
CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER

249
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:16,981
ASSOCIATION FOR HIM BUT THE

250
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:19,517
DELIVERY WAS TERRIBLE IN THIS,

251
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:20,351
AVERAGE MATERIAL.

252
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:21,553
THE VOICE WAS NOT GOOD.

253
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:22,654
I'M GLAD YOU SET IT AND I DIDN'T

254
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,889
HAVE TO SAY IT FIRST.

255
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:27,325
BUT THE POINT IS, I BLAME THE

256
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:28,159
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS'

257
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:28,827
DINNER ASSOCIATION FOR THIS.

258
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,328
THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING

259
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,529
INTO WHEN THEY BOOKED THIS

260
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:31,896
PERSON.

261
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:34,766
BUT THIS IS WHO THE LEFT IS.

262
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:38,503
THEY HAVE BEEN SMEARING AND

263
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,105
HURTING CONSERVATIVES AND

264
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,406
TRAFFICKING IN THIS KIND OF

265
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:42,107
HATEFUL, UNFUNNY STUFF FOR THE

266
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:44,943
LAST YEAR.

267
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:46,644
ON THE SHOW WE'VE HAD MONTAGES

268
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:48,046
OF THE STUFF FROM CHELSEA

269
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:52,951
HANDLER GOING AFTER MELANIA.

270
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,519
THE ASSASSINATION JOKES WITH

271
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:54,953
KATHY GRIFFIN.

272
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:55,353
JOHNNY DEPP.

273
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:58,123
YOU HAD CHRIS MATTHEW SAY

274
00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:58,756
HORRIBLE THINGS.

275
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:01,759
WHAT THEY SAY ON "MORNING JOE."

276
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,760
SWEAR WORDS ON CNN.

277
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,496
IT'S BEEN DESPICABLE.

278
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:05,530
NO ONE HAS EVER CONDEMNED IT,

279
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,532
AND HERE'S THE REASONS WHY THEY

280
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:08,299
CONDEMNED IT THIS TIME.

281
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,201
IT WAS DONE IN THEIR ROOM AT

282
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,803
THEIR DINNER BY A COMEDIAN WHO

283
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:13,538
THEY HIRED, AND IT WAS DONE TO

284
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:15,140
THE PERSON'S FACE.

285
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,641
ALL THE OTHER HATEFUL STUFF WAS

286
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,575
ON TWITTER.

287
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,377
IT WAS ON SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOW.

288
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:20,979
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE

289
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:21,446
RESPONSIBILITY.

290
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:23,148
THE REASON THEY HAD TO CONDEMN

291
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:25,416
THIS COMEDIAN NOW IS BECAUSE IT

292
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,784
WAS A P.R. PROBLEM FOR THEM.

293
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:28,353
THEY WERE ONLY DOING IT FOR THAT

294
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:29,888
REASON AND THAT REASON ALONE.

295
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:32,023
>> Greg: JUAN, TO THAT POINT,

296
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:33,758
DO YOU THINK THE WHITE HOUSE

297
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:35,226
CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION WAS

298
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:35,894
COWARDLY FOR DISTANCING

299
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:36,294
THEMSELVES?

300
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,229
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE.

301
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:39,063
THEY MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE

302
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:39,597
HER THERE.

303
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:41,666
THEY SHOULD HAVE SUPPORTED HER

304
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,034
EYE THINK.

305
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,102
>> Juan: I THINK THEY MUST BE

306
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:45,737
REACTING TO SOME BACKLASH THEY

307
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:46,104
RECEIVED.

308
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:47,238
I THINK THE BACKLASH IN MY MIND

309
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:49,841
TO SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE, THERE

310
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:53,144
WAS NO ONE WALKING OUT, BY THE

311
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:53,411
WAY.

312
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:54,145
YOU HAD SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS

313
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:55,113
SITTING ON THE STAGE.

314
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:57,248
I BELIEVE SHE WAS TWO PEOPLE

315
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,516
REMOVED FROM THE LECTERN.

316
00:08:58,516 --> 00:08:59,918
SHE IS SITTING THERE, AND EVEN

317
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,587
THE TV CAMERAS THEN ENLARGED THE

318
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,622
PERSPECTIVE SO YOU COULD SEE

319
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:07,926
SANDERS REACTING TO MISS WOLF.

320
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,427
THE PROBLEM WAS IT JUST FELT

321
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:11,296
UNFAIR TO HER.

322
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:14,332
I THOUGHT -- I SAW SARAH

323
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:15,633
HUCKABEE SANDERS AND I SAID I

324
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,302
THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF

325
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:18,736
HUMOR BECAUSE IN THE MOMENT YOU

326
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,305
WERE WORRIED SHE WAS GOING TO

327
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:21,339
BURST INTO TEARS OR STAND UP AND

328
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:22,440
WALK OUT AND THERE WOULD BE A

329
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,509
WHOLE DEAL ABOUT THAT.

330
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,544
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE

331
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:27,178
CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION

332
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:27,912
WANTED THEIR EVENT.

333
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,081
WHERE I DISAGREE WITH YOU GUYS,

334
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:30,748
SHE WAS HILARIOUS.

335
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,651
I THINK SHE WAS GENIUS FUNNY.

336
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:34,319
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

337
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,554
SHE WAS PICKING ON THE PRESS A

338
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:37,322
LOT.

339
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:38,890
SHE WAS PICKING ON DEMOCRATS.

340
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,826
SHE SAID ABOUT THE IDEA THAT

341
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,895
FRANKEN IS GONE, SHE SAID TED

342
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,563
KENNEDY PROBABLY SAID HEY, I

343
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:46,664
MURDERED A GIRL, THAT KIND OF

344
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:46,965
THING.

345
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:49,234
>> Greg: THAT WAS A GOOD JOKE.

346
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,336
>> Juan: LIES HERE WITH YOU

347
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,571
GUYS, YOU TALK ABOUT LIBERAL

348
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:54,439
INTOLERANCE FOR A VARIETY OF

349
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:55,440
VOICES AND SPEECH.

350
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,975
HERE'S A VARIETY OF COLOR HERE'S

351
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:57,775
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

352
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,744
SHE WENT AFTER AND PROBABLY HER

353
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,112
MOST TELLING THING WAS SHE SAID

354
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:03,948
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS IN THE PRESS,

355
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:05,116
YOU CREATED THIS MONSTER.

356
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:08,519
AND NOW YOU ARE MAKING BOOKS,

357
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,121
PODCASTS, TV SHOWS, MAKING

358
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:10,421
MONEY.

359
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,023
BUT ALL YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

360
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:15,126
IS TRUMP AND RUSSIA.

361
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,961
ANOTHER GOOD PART WAS WHEN SHE

362
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,329
WENT AFTER WHITE WOMEN.

363
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:19,297
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE

364
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:19,964
THIS.

365
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:22,166
SHE SAID YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S

366
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,067
GOING ON NOT ONLY WITH SARAH

367
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,503
HUCKABEE SANDERS BUT YOU THINK

368
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:27,171
ABOUT KELLYANNE CONWAY.

369
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:28,339
YOU THINK ABOUT IVANKA.

370
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,040
EVERYBODY SAYS WOMEN'S ISSUES

371
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,441
ARE GOING TO BE AT THE

372
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:31,142
FOREFRONT.

373
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,744
SHE SAID YOU GUYS HAD

374
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:34,779
DISAPPOINTED WHITE WOMEN AND SHE

375
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,048
CALLED THEM UNCLE TOMS IN TERMS

376
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:37,615
OF WHITE WOMEN.

377
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:38,883
EVERYBODY, WHERE I WAS SAYING,

378
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:43,154
-- SITTING, PEOPLE WERE

379
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:43,521
LAUGHING.

380
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:45,123
>> Jesse: I WATCH THE WHOLE

381
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:45,923
THING ON C-SPAN.

382
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:48,092
SHE LOST THE CROWD EARLY AND SHE

383
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:48,426
BOMBED.

384
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:50,728
THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD MATERIAL

385
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,730
ABOUT THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE FROM

386
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,399
JIM ACOSTA TO TWITTER TO THE

387
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,500
RUSSIANS TO PELOSI AND

388
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,933
CHUCK SCHUMER.

389
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:59,070
IT IS SO EASY TO MAKE, EVEN

390
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,105
CLEAN JOKES, THE MAJORITY OF THE

391
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,340
STUFF WAS VERY DIRTY.

392
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,841
I CAN HANDLE DIRTY JOKES AND

393
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,143
EVERYBODY THERE CAN HANDLE DIRTY

394
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:05,443
JOKES.

395
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:07,145
I THINK IT TAKES MORE TALENT TO

396
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:07,945
BE CLEAN.

397
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,714
ALMOST EVERYTHING IS FILTHY.

398
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,749
YOU CAN BE MEAN BUT THE JOKES

399
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:12,183
HAVE TO LAND.

400
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:13,351
>> Kimberly: DO YOU KNOW WHAT

401
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:15,753
THAT IS, JESSE SAYING HE CAN DO

402
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:16,988
IT.

403
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:20,925
WANTING GREG TO DO IT.

404
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,927
>> Greg: DONALD TRUMP HAD A

405
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:23,928
SUGGESTION HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER

406
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:31,669
AND IT WAS:

407
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:32,503
THE SO-CALLED COMEDIAN REALLY

408
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:33,571
"BOMBED."

409
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:34,272
@GregGutfeld SHOULD HOST NEXT

410
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:36,574
YEAR!

411
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:39,911
SO I AM SAYING YES.

412
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,113
LET'S DO A COUNTER DINNER.
