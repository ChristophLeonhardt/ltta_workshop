as a Canadian I have a really um I have a wussy find government so as a Canadian I'm all thing all things being relative I'm sort of pleased with the way the the Israeli communications people are dealing with this they are you know when they see the like you say the pally wood images they you know report the other side so you know we saw Netanyahu's his Arab language spokesperson tweeting out images that were not really reported anywhere of the Nazi flag flying at those they call them protests but Ryan they're riots like is it's right firstly tire burning in America is a very very and I presume Canada and in fact most of the sentient world tire burning is a crime just burning one tire can get you locked up because the environmental damage is so enormous so they went through one week one Friday of burning tires sucked to the point where they they then actually were complaining because they didn't have enough tires they had a tire shortage in Gaza I don't if they were burning new ones honestly so you know then then they all the tires that get there go through our checkpoints you know because we check everything so but the problem is that the world's media and this is another sort of the world's media I believe is skewed dramatically towards present in the Palestinian site uncritically and what happens is and this is what I wrote about in two pieces on Israeli cool which is a blog I write on quite often what happens is Gaza is a militarily run dictatorship some ass controls Gaza now a few years back there was allegedly early as thirteen years ago since the last elections Hamas did quite well in a regional sense but then after that after winning some local authority they had a military coup and kicked out the other side which is Fatah which is the the Palestinian Authority of much more the bath kick them out threw people off buildings killed them exiled them created a new government so they run the place so what happens is you get something called the Gaza Health Ministry which sounds great and the Gaza Health Ministry is based in Chiffre hospital but the Gaza Health Ministry is just Tomas Chiffre Hospital is actually the the civilian cover for the Hamas control bunkers which sit underneath so when when we're bombed when we were bombing in 2014 and before we can't bomb the Hamas command and control center because it's right underneath their primary hospital sorry I didn't that just reminds me of what they do with schools with the UN red skulls and they put weapons caches in them so that you're going to bomb them and then you know then they proliferate Israelis as child murderers when they're putting a little cash is under schools that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
