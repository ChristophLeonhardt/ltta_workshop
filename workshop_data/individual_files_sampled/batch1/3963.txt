and Donald Trump is here still Jeb's answer the other day on women's health issues is a disaster I didn't started with Lindsey Graham I couldn't care less about Lindsey Graham he's registered that I think zero in the polls you know you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her wherever and he's really turned out to be a great divider as opposed to a great unified China has no respect for President Obama whatsoever he's probably the worst president in the history of our country nobody has been able to find any records that he was born in that house no one is happier no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald and that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter like did we fake the moon landing what really happened in Roswell and where are Biggie and Tupac all kidding aside obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience for example no seriously just recently in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice at the steakhouse the men's cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks and there was a lot of blame to go around but you mr. Trump recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership and so ultimately you didn't blame little Jon or meatloaf you fired Gary Busey and these are the County decisions that would keep me up at night
