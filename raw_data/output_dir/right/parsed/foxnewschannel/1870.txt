NEARLY 2,000 PEOPLE ON THE BIG
ISLAND HAVE BEEN EVACUATED FROM
THEIR HOMES.
PETE?
PETE: JILLIAN, THANK YOU WELL
PRESIDENT TRUMP REVVING UP THE
CROWD IN INDIANA WITH HIS
RESPECT FOR THE FLAG.
LISTEN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WE HAVE PRIDE
IN OUR HISTORY AND RESPECT FOR
OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG.
>>  
>>  USA.
USA.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: AND WE'RE GOING
TO DEFEND OUR VALUES.
WE NEED PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO
SHARE OUR VALUES.
PETE: JOINING US WITH HIS
REACTION MEDAL OF HONOR
RECIPIENT RETIRED MARINE CORPS
SARGENT DAKOTA MEYERS.
IF YOU HAVE NOT READ DAKOTA'S
CITATION FROM THE MEDAL OF HONOR
GOOGLE IT RIGHT NOW AND LISTEN
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS GUY DID
FOR OUR COUNTRY I'M SERIOUS.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
PETE: YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT
LAST NIGHT HE TALKS ABOUT IT ALL
THE TIME ABOUT PATRIOTISM AND
STANDING FOR THE FLAG.
WHY DOES HE CONTINUE TO
REITERATE THOSE TOPICS?
>>  YOU KNOW, LOOK I THINK IT
COMES DOWN TO YOU COULD SAY A
LOT ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT
THE MAN IS A PATRIOT AND LOVES
HIS COUNTRY.
IT SAYS SO MUCH ABOUT HIM
BECAUSE HE KEEPS PUTTING THESE
BASIC FUNDAMENTALS THAT ME AND
YOU GREW UP WITH.
I MEAN, YOU NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
NOT STANDING FOR THE FLAG OR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.
THESE ARE THE BASIC FUNDAMENTALS
THAT WE ALL GREW UP WITH THAT
WERE SO IMPORTANT AND IT'S KIND
OF LIKE IN THE MILITARY RIGHT?
WHY DO WE STILL GO WITH CUSTOMS
AND COURTESY RIGHT?
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT.
IT REMINDS US OF THE SACRIFICES
THAT CAME BEFORE US IT'S ABOUT
PAYING RESPECT AND THAT'S, LOOK
THE PATRIOT.
PETE: IF YOU DON'T EXECUTE THE
BASICS YOU FORGET ABOUT THEM
VERY QUICKLY SPEAKING OF MORE
THAN JUST THE BASICS WE JUST GOT
NEWS YESTERDAY THAT FIVE TOP
ISIS COMMANDERS WERE CAPTURED ON
THE IRAQI SYRIAN BORDER PART OF
THE ONGOING EFFORT TO CONTINUE
TO DECIMATE THEM.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE EFFORTS
THERE AGAINST ISIS?
>>  NO, LOOK IT'S JUST, HE MADE
A COMMITMENT TO GO AFTER ISIS
AND LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DOING.
HE'S GOING AFTER ISIS.
I MEAN I THINK IT'S JUST ANOTHER
EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER WIN, RIGHT?
PETE: ABSOLUTELY.
THEY SHOULD BE WEARING THE
ORANGE JUMP SUITS OF GUANTANAMO
BAY IN MY OPINION BUT IF YOU
LOOK AT THE ACTUAL MEDIA NETWORK
COVERAGE THE SO-CALLED
MAINSTREAM MEDIA THAT LOVES TO
HATE THIS PRESIDENT WE'VE GOT A
GRAPHIC I BELIEVE.
COUPLE OF NEWS NETWORKS COVERED
THIS CAPTURE OF FIVE OF THE TOP
ISIS LEADERS YOU'LL SEE IT ZERO
SECONDS, ZERO SECONDS, THANKFUL
LY, CBS ACTUALLY COVERED
IT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES
WORTHY OF THAT KIND OF COVERAGE.
WHY ARE WE IGNORING THESE KINDS
OF SUCCESSES ON THE BATTLEFIELD?
>>  LOOK, I MEAN, THESE NETWORKS
ARE MORE FOCUSED ON IT'S NOT
JOURNALISM ANY MORE.
IT'S THOSE NETWORKS I LOOK AT
IT'S WHERE OPINIONS ARE FACTS TO
THEM RIGHT?
THEY WOULD RATHER SEE THE
PRESIDENT FAIL THAN AMERICA
SUCCEED.
WE KEEP SEEING THIS OVER AND
OVER BUT IT'S TRUE.
LOOK AT THE NORTH KOREA SIDE OF
IT RIGHT?
LOOK AT WHAT HE JUST
ACCOMPLISHED.
HE FACILITATED TO ACCOMPLISH
WHETHER IT'S HIM OR WHATEVER
HE'S ACCOMPLISHING SO MUCH AND
YOU NEVER HEAR THE WINS.
ALL YOU HEAR IS THE NEGATIVES.
PETE: WHEN HE WINS THEY STILL
TELL YOU WHY HE'S GOT TO BE LOS
ING.
>>  EVEN AFTER HE GOT A MEETING
WITH THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR
KIM JONG-UN THEN THEY WANTED TO
GO WELL WHY WOULD HE MEET YOU ON
THE DMZ?
THEY JUST KEEP WANTING TO FIND
THE NEGATIVE BUT HE KEEPS
WINNING.
PETE: BRIEFLY AS A WAR FIGHTER
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE A
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF LIKE THIS?
>>  I THINK IT PUTS CONFIDENCE
BEHIND YOU.
YOU CAN'T SIT HERE AND, YOU KNOW
, WITH THE CAPTURE OF THESE
FIVE ISIS GUYS, I MEAN, WE HAVE
CONFIDENCE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
GET TRADED BACK FOR A TRADER.
THE CONFIDENCE LEVEL, I MEAN YOU
LOOK AT WHAT HE'S PUTTING AND
DOING IN SYRIA RIGHT?
HE'S DOING WHAT HE'S SAYING HE'S
GOING TO DO AND I THINK FOR US,
AS WAR FIGHTERS, IT GIVES US THE
CONFIDENCE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING
IF NOTHING ELSE IT MEANS
SOMETHING AND WE HAVE SOMEBODY
BACKING US UP NO MATTER WHAT.
PETE: I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
