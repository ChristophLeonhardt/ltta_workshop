All cybersecurity experts who
have given electronic voting
machines any thought
agree.
These machines have got to go.
To show you why, I’m running a mock
election
using the same dangerous and obsolete
machines still in use today.
Our election will find out
whether Michigan students
prefer their own university
or our arch rival Ohio State.
Here we are.
After the chaos of
the 2000 election,
we were promised a modern
and dependable way to vote.
I’m here to tell you that the
electronic voting machines
Americans got to solve the
problem of voting integrity —
they turned out to
be an awful idea.
One vote for McCain.
Huh?!
That’s because people like me
can hack them all too easily.
I’m a computer scientist who has
hacked a lot of electronic voting
machines.
I even turned one machine
into a video game console.
Imagine what the Russians
and North Koreans can do.
I’ve even gone to Congress
to raise the alarm.
Our highly computerized election
infrastructure
is vulnerable to sabotage
and even to cyber-attacks
This is the same
electronic voting machine
used in Georgia and parts
of Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky
Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas
and even in swing states
like Virginia, Florida
and Pennsylvania.
Millions of Americans voted
on paperless electronic voting
machines in the 2016 election.
Who are you going to vote for?
Hundred percent Michigan.
Obviously Michigan.
Michigan.
But here’s a little
secret between you and me.
I’ve already hacked these worthless
machines.
Step one: buy a voting machine on Ebay.
Or, if you are the
North Koreans, hack
the manufacturer and
steal their software code.
Step two: write a virus.
Step three: email your virus
to every election official
responsible for
programming the voting
machines with new ballots.
Many of these officials
are easy to find online.
Step four: sip coffee
and wait.
Step five: hijack the
ballot programming
and let the election
officials copy
your invisible malicious code
onto the voting machines.
Step six:
watch your code
silently steal votes.
All right, here are the results
from the electronic voting
machines.
Ohio State wins 131 to 108.
There’s a good reason
we computer scientists
are paranoid.
It’s a golden age for hackers.
The computer virus
that destroyed
Iranian nuclear equipment —
This is one of the largest data
breaches in history.
More than one billion
of its accounts were hacked.
What chance do the people
running your local elections
really have against
Russia or North Korea?
OK, everyone.
I hacked the voting machines.
I do have the real
results,
because we also counted on paper.
Michigan wins!
Michigan won in a landslide.
And I can say this confidently
because I have the real results
from the safest and
simplest solution.
Paper ballots.
We need to take a hard look
at the equipment that actually
records and reports votes.
Even though the Senate intelligence
committee is finally
showing some understanding
of the problem,
it’s not enough.
All states in this
country, the people
ultimately responsible
for how we vote,
In a real election,
an official could quickly
scan these paper ballots
and shortly after, have a
human verify the results.
Paper plus audits: all elections
should be run this way.
But if you don’t want to believe
me or every single expert
in cybersecurity who’s
thought this through,
then take it from this guy.
It’s old fashioned,
but it’s always
good to have a paper
backup system of voting.
It’s called paper.
