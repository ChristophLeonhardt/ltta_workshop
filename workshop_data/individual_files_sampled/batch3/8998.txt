Sean: ANOTHER INVESTIGATION? THERE WAS NO COOPERATION IN THE FIRST ONE. NONE. IT'S NOT FUNNY, BUT IN A WAY IT IS. APPARENTLY ONE KICK OF THE MEAL WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR SENATOR FEINSTEIN, WHO I LIKE VERY MUCH. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT EVERY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN THE SENATE TO BE ASKED TOMORROW. DO YOU AGREE WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN? IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE, ARE YOU FOR REOPENING THE KAVANAUGH INVESTIGATION? ARE YOU FOR MORE HUMILIATION, GRADING TREATMENT OF THIS FINE MAN, OR YOU FOR CONTINUING THIS DEBACLE? DO YOU AGREE WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN? IF YOU GET IN CHARGE OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS HE WILL GO AFTER KAVANAUGH AGAIN. I THINK EVERY VOTER IN ALL THESE TRUMP STATES THAT HAVE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS NEED TO ASK THAT QUESTION, ARE YOU WITH DIANE OR NOT? Sean: WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT HILLARY COMMENTS, KICK HIM ERIC HOLDER. TWO POLITICIANS, REPUBLICANS IN MINNESOTA HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED AND PUNCHED. ONE GUY SEVERELY INJURED, A WOMAN PUNCHED. MAXINE WATERS, CREATE A CROWD. FOLLOW THEM INTO GROCERY STORES, GAS STATIONS. DEPARTMENT STORES. THEY ARE NOT WANTED ANYWHERE ANYMORE. SHE'S GOING TO BE A LEADER IF THEY TAKE BACK THE HOUSE? I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. Sean: AND YOU WERE SPAT AT BY THE WAY. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CAN'T WIN AT THE BALLOT BOX. YOU TAKE THOSE OF US WHO DID WIN A NEW TRY TO INTIMIDATE US IN BENDING TO YOUR WILL. I'VE NEVER HAD POLICE SECURITY BEFORE, CAPITOL HILL POLICE PROTECT ME EVER BEFORE UNTIL THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. HAD A GUY WHO WOULD NOT LET THE ELEVATOR CLOSE. I HAD TO GO TO MY OFFICE AND SOMEBODY ON THE ELEVATOR PUSHED HIM OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. I HAD A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AROUND ME FILMING ME, YELLING AT ME, ALL OVER MY JACKET. IT WAS PRETTY BAD AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WENT THROUGH. SO THIS IS ON THE BALLOT. WHAT YOU WANT AMERICA TO LOOK LIKE? ONCE THE ELECTION IS OVER DO YOU WANT THOSE WHO LOST TO TRY TO PHYSICALLY ASSAULT THOSE WHO WON, OR DO YOU WANT TO HAVE AN ELECTION ONCE IT'S OVER WE TRY TO WORK TOGETHER AND GOVERN THE COUNTRY? Sean: IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE ABOUT? AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANY DEMOCRAT, TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DUKE TO CREATE JOBS. TEN YEARS WORKING IN RESTAURANTS STARTING AS A DISHWASHER. TEN YEARS IN CONSTRUCTION STARTING AS A HOUSE PAINTER. ROOFING FOLLOWING THREE STORIES, THAT'S MY BACKGROUND. YOU GREW UP IN A BAR. AND YOU HAD THE SAME KIND OF BACKGROUND. WE NOW HAVE 4 MILLION NEW JOBS, 400,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS, BETTER TRADE DEALS, LESS REGULATION, A PATH TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN HISTORY, SECURING THE BORDER, NORTH KOREA. THINKING, WOW. THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE HERE. ISRAEL IS SAFER, ISIS IS BEING DESTROYED. PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED A QUESTION IN 2016, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? AND MOST PEOPLE SAID NOT MUCH. THEY SAW NO HOPE WITH HILLARY CLINTON. LET ME TELL YOU IN 2018 IF THE DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LOSE. I WANT EVERY DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR THE SENATE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DO YOU AGREE WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN THAT WE SHOULD REOPEN THE KAVANAUGH INVESTIGATION IF DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER? Sean: DON'T THEY WANT TO IMPEACH? THEY WANT TO IMPEACH THE GUY. IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE IS A DEMOCRAT, DO YOU AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS IMPEACH KAVANAUGH? THESE ANSWERS TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT THE PERSON RUNNING. SO THEY NEED TO ARE YOU WITH DIANE OR NOT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PLEASED THAT WE GOT A GOOD CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE, THEY ARE READY TO MOVE ON. Sean: THERE WAS ONLY ONE DEMOCRAT THAT WAS WILLING TO LET DUE PROCESS, THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. I WANT TO SEE WHO THESE OTHER DEMOCRATS ARE LISTENING TO. CLEARLY THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATE. BUT IF I AM IN CHARGE AS A REPUBLICAN, SENATOR GRASSLEY DID A WONDERFUL JOB BUT I MAY BE THE CHAIRMAN IF HE MOVES TO FINANCE. I PROMISE YOU THIS, WE ARE GOING TO INVESTIGATE WHO BETRAYED DR. FORD. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHY HER LAWYERS DID NOT TELL HER THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE GONE TO CALIFORNIA TO INTERVIEW HER IN PRIVATE SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS. THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO INVESTIGATE. Sean: I THINK YOU'RE ONE OF YOUR FINEST MOMENTS IN YOUR CAREER STANDING UP FOR TRUTH.
