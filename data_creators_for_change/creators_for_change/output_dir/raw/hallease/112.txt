water with me this is how I try to stay

92
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,780
hydrated because for me if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

93
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,310
the water in front of me I will become

94
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,020
dehydrated because I will just forget to

95
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,300
drink water and so I've gotten into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

96
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,160
habit of just bringing a water bottle

97
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me everywhere because as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long as I</font>

just have it in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me in sight</font>

99
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,340
plain sight I'll instinctively just keep

100
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,990
drinking from it throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day and</font>

101
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,060
this one is almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> empty because I've</font>

102
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,729
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> drinking it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i hook it up right</font>

103
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,590
here these are strong enough to hold a

104
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,260
hundred pounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> and usually people on set</font>

105
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,180
use them to hook things together if

106
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,040
you're a gaffer on set you probably have

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,050
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these ah that is everything</font>
