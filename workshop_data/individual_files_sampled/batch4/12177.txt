you've talked about how you are not really appreciative of the church that you're going to right now and just how they've in like incorporated politics into some of what they're doing so what I was wondering is what your views on how the church should handle politics and how a church should engage with its congregation on these political issues or like moral issues that have become political issues so what should churches do with that I think a really good question I think that my general rule is that God loves both Republicans and Democrats for some reason that is way beyond my understanding but but since this is obviously true and since we have to trust that most people are acting out of goodwill which i think is true most people are acting out of goodwill I think the what the church has to do is establish the ground rules of the argument so for instance immigration it is perfectly fair to say you know these people are suffering and need to be taken care of and therefore we should let them in it's perfectly fair to say if you let people in the country cannot withstand the onrush it has to have a border it is not perfectly fair to say who cares about these people you know to hell with them you know they I don't like them they're Mexicans screw them you know like whatever whatever that it that is not the argument we're going to have so the church can definitely set the rules of the argument I I I even think I mean the borderline of this for me is abortion because I do think abortion is wrongly seen I do think it is in fact the purposeful taking of an innocent life and I think the one life that's being lost there is the one person who can't speak up who doesn't have a voice voice who doesn't have a vote but even in that situation I would understand a church person saying let us have this you know argument in keeping with our beliefs of of protecting the innocent protecting the weak making sure that power does not run run wild and that's what I think churches should do and can do you know yeah so do you think that churches should just preach Jesus then to bring people together or should they also teach like values and how to live in life - well well Jesus said I'm not here to bring people together he said I've come with a sword I'm gonna separate the closest people listen I think if you just teach Jesus you will start enough killed the guy I mean he would you know I mean this is the thing he didn't he didn't say he didn't come down to earth to say be nice I mean this is the thing that drives me crazy if he was here to see you don't get killed for saying be nice he was saying something really radical he was expecting you to live by values that are very hard to live by when things get hot right and so ya teach Jesus and you'll cause enough trouble without talking about what's happening in the news that day
