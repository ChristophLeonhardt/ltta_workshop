Tucker: WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT." THE LONG NATIONAL NIGHTMARE IS OVER. WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT. PAUL MANAFORT IS BEHIND BARS TONIGHT. THE 69-YEAR-OLD LOBBYIST WAS DRAGGED TO PRISON ON THE ORDER OF THE FEDERAL JUDGE. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT MANAFORT'S IMPRISONMENT EARLIER TODAY. WOW, A TOUGH SENTENCE FOR PAUL MANAFORT MANAFOR MANAFORT. WHAT ABOUT? THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S VIEW. ON THE OTHER HAND, WITH MANAFORT IN A CAGE, THE REST OF US CAN RELAX. UNCHAIN THE DOOR. LET THE KIDS PLAY IN THE YARD. TAKE THE FIRST DEEP BREATH IN DECADES. IT'S A NEW DAY AMERICA, WE ARE SAFE. WE HAVE BAD NEWS AS WELL. PAUL MANAFORT'S CRIME WAS VIOLATING THE FOREIGN AGENT'S REGISTRATION ACT PASSED IN 1938. ADVANCING THE INTEREST OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITHOUT REGISTERING WITH THE U.S. IS A FELONY. THAT MEAN MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WILL HEAD TO JAIL. PODESTA AND BOTH CLINTONS AND UNNI-VISION TAKE MONEY FROM FOREIGN INTERESTS. THE LAW IS CLEAR. THEY ARE HEADED TO THE BIG HOUSE. ALL OF THEM. BEST OF LUCK. MANAFORT WAS ALSO ACCUSED OF TRYING TO INFLUENCE WITNESSES IN THE CASE AGAINST HIM. THAT'S SERIOUS AND POSSIBLY THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVE IT AT TRIAL. TONIGHT PAUL MANAFORT HASN'T BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY CRIME. HE IS STILL INNOCENT, BUT NOW IN JAIL. THAT MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED IF MANAFORT WAS A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY OR ANYONE CONSIDERED HIM A FLIGHT RISK. LATE MIDDLE AGE WITH NO PASSPORT. LET'S BE HONEST. PAUL MANAFORT IS IN JAIL BECAUSE PROSECUTORS WANT HIM TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. THEY ARE SWEATING HIM. NO RUBBER HOSES OR TRUCK BATTERIES, BUT THE POINT IS THE SAME. PROSECUTORS WANT TO INFLUENCE A POTENTIAL WITNESS IN THIS CASE. AS YESTERDAY'S IG REPORT SHOWED,
