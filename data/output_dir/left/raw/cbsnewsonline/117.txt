PROCESS. 

49
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,126
HE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HE 

50
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,127
WANTS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

51
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,128

POINT TO REMAIN UNINVOLVED. 

55
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,268
HOWEVER, HE SEES MORE AND MORE 

56
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,471
EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THIS IS 

57
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:46,505
PROVING FURTHER AND FURTHER TO 

58
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:47,373
BE A TOTAL WITCHHUNT 

59
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,109
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT WAS 

60
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,111
BASED ON A FALSE AND UNVERIFIED 

61
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,712

WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO USE SUCH 

65
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:01,955
STRONG LANGUAGE? 

66
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,156
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS 

67
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:08,061
BEEN PRETTY STRONG SINCE DAY 

68
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:08,994

69
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:09,228

70
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:10,263
HE WAS RESPONDING TO COMMENTS 

71
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,665
MADE FROM THEM AND HE WILL 

72
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,933
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE SAFETY 

73
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,501
AND THE SECURITY OF THE 

74
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,836
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

75
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,137
>> WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO HAVE 

76
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,438
DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE 

77
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:20,907
PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT OF 

78
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,107
IRAN? 

79
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,775
>> I WILL NOT GET INTO 

80
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:28,348
SPECIFICS AND NOT WITH THE 

81
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:28,581
PRESS. 

82
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,749
THAT IS A DETERMINATION ON WHAT 

83
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,783
THE PRESIDENT THINKS THAT LOOKS 

84
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,016
LIKE. 

85
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,585
THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND THE FOCUS 

86
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,586
OF THE PRESIDENT IS TO MAKE 

87
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,654
SURE THAT WE KEEP NUCLEAR 

88
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,922
WEAPONS OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND 

89
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,056
THAT WE FOCUS ON THE PROTECTION 

90
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:37,956
OF AMERICA. 

91
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,525
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED 

92
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,125
YESTERDAY THAT RUSSIA'S 

93
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:45,231
ELECTION INTERFERENCE WAS -- 

94
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,633
LAST WEEK HE SAID HE HAD FULL 

95
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,900
FAITH IN THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE 

96
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,234
AGENCIES. 

97
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,402
DOES HE BELIEVE THE 

98
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,504
INTERFERENCE WAS -- OR DOES HE 

99
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,072
HAVE FAITH IN THE INTELLIGENCE 

100
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,307
AGENCIES WHO HAVE PROVED 

101
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:58,344
DEFINITIVELY THE OTHER WAY? 

102
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,846
>> AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 

103
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,847
MANY TIMES AND STATED OVER AND 

104
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,285
OVER AGAIN AS A NUMBER OF OTHER 

105
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:05,952
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, WE 

106
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,719
MAINTAIN THAT RUSSIA INTERFERED 

107
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,588
IN THE ELECTIONS. 

108
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,322
THE PRESIDENT, HOWEVER, VERY 

109
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:15,862
MUCH SO AND HAS REPEATEDLY, AS 

110
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,263
AGAIN AS THE REST OF US, HIS 

111
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,097
CAMPAIGN COLLUDING IN THAT 

112
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,532
PROCESS IS A TOTAL HOAX AND WE 

113
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,867
HOLD STRONG TO THAT. 

114
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,570
>> -- HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT IS 

115
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,004
A HOAX. 

116
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,605
>> THE PRESIDENT IS REFERENCING 

117
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,108
THE COMPONENT. 

118
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,343
HE DOES HAVE FAITH IN THE 

119
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,110
INTELLIGENCE THAT SUGGEST THAT 

120
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,812
RUSSIA WAS INVOLVED. IT IS 

121
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:37,617
IMPORTANT THAT THE SAME 

122
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,418
INFORMATION CONCLUDES THAT IT 

123
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,652
HAD NO IMPACT ON THE ELECTION 

124
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,523
AND THAT THE PRESIDENT, AGAIN, 

125
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,757
WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT THAT THERE 

126
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,892
WAS NO COLLUSION. 

127
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,429
>> THE PRESIDENT FORCEFULLY 

128
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:51,564
SPOKE OUT AGAINST IRAN AND HE 

129
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,598
FORCEFULLY SPOKE OUT AGAINST -- 

130
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,267
AND HE WILL SPOKE THAT'S LIKE 

131
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,868
SPEAK OUT AGAINST ANY THREAT 

132
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,772
UNITED STATES. 

133
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,707
RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IS A THREAT 

134
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,340
TO OUR DEMOCRACY. 

135
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,542
WHY WILL HE NOT DENOUNCE THAT? 

136
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,409
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

137
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,278
INCREDIBLY TOUGH ON RUSSIA. 

138
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,445
HE HAS BROUGHT IT UP DIRECTLY 

139
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:07,714
TO HIM IN PERSON EVERY SINGLE 

140
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,350
TIME THAT THEY HAVE MET. 

141
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,717
HE HAS PUT UNPRECEDENTED 

142
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,386
SANCTIONS AND HAS BEEN 

143
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,555
EXTREMELY TOUGH ON RUSSIA 

144
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,822
ACROSS A NUMBER OF FRONTS WHICH 

145
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:19,257
WE HAVE ADDRESS. 

146
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,892
FRANKLY, I AM NOT SURE WHY THAT 

147
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:26,299
IS SO HARD FOR THE MEDIA TO 

148
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:26,799
WRITE ABOUT. 

149
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,034
WE HAVE REPEATED IT TIME AND 

150
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:28,367
TIME AGAIN. 

151
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,337
THE POLICY THAT THE PRESIDENT 

152
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,805
HAS BEEN SINCE THE DAY ONE HAS 

153
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,140
BEEN EXTREMELY TOUGH ON RUSSIA, 

154
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,708
PROBABLY MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER 

155
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,276
COUNTRY. 

156
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,378
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

157
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,347
SENATOR RAND PAUL TODAY MADE A 

158
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,250
STRONG ATTEMPT TO -- THE 

159
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,051
CREDIBILITY OF FORMER CIA 

160

DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN SAYING 

161
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:50,890
THAT HE USED, I QUOTE, 

162
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,090
MONETIZING HIS SECURITY 

163
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,528
CLEARANCE AND THAT IT SHOULD BE 

164
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,231
REMOVED. HE EVEN CALLED ON THE 

165
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:58,998
PRESIDENT TO DO THIS. 

166
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,433
WILL THE PRESIDENT CONSIDER 

167
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:05,705
SENATOR PAUL'S SUGGESTION AND 

168
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,939
CALL FOR THE REMOVAL OF FORMER 

169
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,040
DIRECTOR BRENNAN SECURITY 

170
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,408
CLEARANCE? 

171
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,609
>> NOT ONLY IS THE PRESIDENT 

172
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,079
LOOKING TO TAKE AWAY BRENNAN 

173
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,046
SECURITY CLEARANCE, HE IS ALSO 

174
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:15,681
LOOKING INTO THE CLEARANCES OF 

175
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:18,117
COMEY, KLAPPER, KAYDEN, RICE 

176
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,753
AND McCABE. 

177
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,821
THE PRESIDENT IS EXPLORING THE 

178
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,021
MECHANISMS TO REMOVE SECURITY 

179
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:23,823
CLEARANCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE 

180
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,857
POLITICIZED AND IN SOME CASES 

181
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,826
MONETIZE THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND 

182
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,764
SECURITY CLEARANCES MAKING 

183
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,398
BASELESS ACCUSATIONS OF 

184
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,966
IMPROPER CONTACT WITH RUSSIA OR 

185
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,068
BEING INFLUENCED BY RUSSIA 

186
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,335
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT IS 

187
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:39,438
EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE AND THE 

188
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:40,506
FACT THAT PEOPLE WITH SECURITY

IS THAT STILL HIS PLAN BE? 

203
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:07,733
>>AS WE HAVE SAID, THE

THAT HE SENT OUT LAST NIGHT WAS 

280
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,476
VERY SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE HE 

281
