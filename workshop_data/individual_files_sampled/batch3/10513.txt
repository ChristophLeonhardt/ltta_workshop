the back-and-forth between the US and China is quickly escalating into an all-out trade war between two of the world's biggest economies in this latest round DC has imposed penalties on two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese goods and that's set to increase further at the beginning of next year Trump clearly means business we're also cracking down on the unfair trade practices from China we are far more bullets we're gonna go 200 million at 25% Chinese made Goods and we will come back with war if they retaliate we have a lot more to come back with but China isn't taking any of this lightly they've hit back and added more tariffs on American products with up to 110 billion dollars and it might not stop there Trump has already threatened to impose tariffs on effectively all US imports from China but what does this all mean for the average American consumer according to Walmart the country's biggest retailer price hikes we are very concerned about the impact these terrorists would have on our business our customers our suppliers in the US economy as a whole the company listed the goods that will be hid ranging from food products to vehicles to toilet paper and Walmart's not the only company quaking at the thought of an economic battle Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma is saying he could no longer deliver on bring a million jobs to the US market this promise was on the basis of friendly china-us cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations but the current situation has already destroyed that basis this promise can be completed and that's gotta hurt given how much Trump loves to talk up how he's creating more jobs for Americans nevertheless the US president seems confident employment figures will continue to rise so it's full steam ahead Terrence off' for the u.s. in a very strong bargaining position with billions of dollars and jobs flowing into our country and yet cost increases of thus far being almost unnoticeable if countries will not make fair deals with us they will be tariffed but China looks to be digging in their heels scrapping plan trade talks and aren't the only friction between Washington and Beijing the u.s. also slapped sanctions on China over the purchase of Russian military equipment claiming the deal is a violation of a law meant to punish Moscow for alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election again China isn't backing down they said they're going to continue cooperation with Russia and we'll take it to a new level Beijing summoned the US ambassador and recalled their navy commander from a trip to America calling the measures a mistake well in Charlie acu√±a move on we strongly call on the US to remedy the mistake and cancel the sanctions otherwise the US has to bear the consequences so as the stalemates pile up so does uncertainty for Chinese and Americans alike you
