KARL ROVE, FORM 80 FORMER CHIEF
OF STAFF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR'S
AND WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU.
WE KNOW THAT POLITICS CAN GET
PRETTY NASTY, BUT IT APPEARS
THAT MR. BLANKENSHIP HAS DECIDED
THAT THIS IS A GOOD PLAN.
A GOOD STRATEGY FOR HIM.
>> I HOPE THAT HE IS PROVED
WRONG, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF
WEST VIRGINIA ARE SENSIBLE,
SOLID, DOWN-TO-EARTH AMERICANS,
FOR A GUY TO GO OUT THERE, THINK
ABOUT THIS, HE WENT TO JAIL
BECAUSE HE RAN A COMPANY WHERE
HE WAS AND CHARGED IN CHARGE,
FLOUTING 29 MINERS THAT DIED
UNDER HIS RESPONSIBLY.
HE DOES NOT LIVE IN THE SAME
STATE, LIVES IN LAS VEGAS.
AND HE IS GOING OUT THERE IN A
DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO WIN.
HE HAS THESE OUTRAGEOUS CHARGES
THAT MITCH IS -- HIS WIFE IS A
CHINA MAN, AND TENS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS, THIS GUY DOES NOT
UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL REALITY
OF THE WORLD.
THE CHILD FAMILY WAS ORIGINALLY
FROM
COMMUNIST CHINA IN 1949, AND
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATL
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATV
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATE
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATI
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THAT
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATH
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATE
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATU
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATI
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATE
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THAT
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATT
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS THATS
AND CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA.
SO LET'S PICK A CLEAR, HE IS A
BIGOT, A MORON, IF HE WINS THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, KISS OUR
CHANCES GO BY APPOINTING
WEST VIRGINIA.
>> Martha: TAMMY?
>> I THINK THAT THIS IS AN
EXTRAORDINARY, I AM NO FAN OF
MITCH McCONNELL, BUT THIS GUY
IS MAKING ME WANT TO DEFEND
MITCH McCONNELL, BECAUSE IT IS
SO ABSURD.
LOOK, THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
SITUATION, HE REPRESENTS WHY
POLITICIANS PRETTY CLEARLY SEEMS
TO BE TRYING TO LOOK AT HIS OWN
REPUTATION BACK OR, HERE'S WHAT
YOU HAVE, YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS
RUNNING ON RACISM AND BIGOTRY,
NO IDEA, NO POLICY IDEA,
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, MAYBE
HE IS RUNNING, SHOULD BE RUNNING
AS A DEMOCRAT AT THIS POINT.
HE IS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO
DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP AND
DONALD TRUMP JR. HAS REJECTED
HIM, DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS GUY,
THE PRESIDENT IN APRIL HAD AN
EVENT WHERE THE TWO OTHER
REPUBLICANS RUNNING WERE THERE
AND SUPPORTED HIM AND SUPPORTED
BUT THIS IS ABOUT TO VOTERS OF
WEST VIRGINIA, THE REPUBLICANS.
IT IS AN INSULT IN THE WAY THAT
HE IS APPROACHING THEM.
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO DO AND TO
ALLOW THIS KIND OF, IT IS ALMOST
LIKE A PARODY, THAT ADD TO, AND
IT IS HEARTBREAKING, BECAUSE WE
HAVE SO MUCH TO DO.
AND THIS IS A GUY WHO I THINK
IT'S NOT JUST TRYING TO SMEAR
MITCH McCONNELL, BUT TRYING TO
SMEAR THE ENTIRE CONSERVATIVE
MOVEMENT IN THE PROCESS.
>> Martha: IT IS INTERESTING
THAT AD THAT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A
PARODY, IT DOES, SORT OF AN
ONION AD OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE
IT IS ALMOST AS IF THEY SAID,
THESE ARE THE BUZZWORDS THAT WE
WANT YOU TO USE, WE WANT YOU TO
SAY CHINA FAMILY, WHAT A BIZARRE
EXPRESSION THAT THAT IS.
THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO WORK.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, THERE
IS THIS MOUNTAINTOP FAMILY
PACKED WHICH ASSOCIATES OF
LEADER McCONNELL ARE INVOLVED
WITH, THEY DO NOT WANT HIM TO
WIN BECAUSE AS MITCH McCONNELL
OFTEN SAYS, HE WANTS CANDIDATES
THAT THEY THINK AND WIN.
SO THEY ARE BACK IN MORRISEY AND
OTHERS EVAN JENKINS, BUT THE
FEAR OF REPUBLICANS IS THAT THIS
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE A SHARON
ANGLE RACE OR WHAT HAPPENED WITH
ROY MOORE, YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE
VERY CONNECTED WITH THE
CAMPAIGNS IN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY, DO YOU THINK, ARE YOU
NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN ON TUESDAY NIGHT?
>> YES, I AM, TWO POINTS, WITH
FULL DISCLOSURE, THIS WEEK I'VE
KNOWN EVAN JENKINS FOR A WHILE,
I DID A FUND-RAISER FOR HIM AND
HIS FIRST RACE FOR CONGRESS
WHERE HE DEFEATED AND THE MOST
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICT IN WEST VIRGINIA AND 19
TERM INCUMBENT, HE IS A DOCTOR,
HE SERVED AT THE STATE
LEGISLATOR, A DEMOCRATIC CHANGE
PARTY WHEN HE WAS IN THE
LEGISLATOR.
SO I WANT FULL DISCLOSURE, I AM
FOR HIM.
AND I CONTRIBUTED BECAUSE I AM
AFRAID OF BLANKENSHIP WINNING.
JENKINS IN THE FOX NEWS POLL A
WEEK AGO THURSDAY HAD 25.
PATRICK MORRISSEY HAD 21,
BLANKENSHIP HAD 16, BUT THERE
ARE 38% UNDECIDED, AND THIS WEEK
SINCE THIS POLL CAME OUT OF THE
FIELD, BLANKENSHIP HAS PUT
$1.2 MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY
INTO THE RACE IN ADDITION, A
DEMOCRATIC SUPER PACKED HEADED
BY THE FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY WHO
PROSECUTED HIM AND SENT HIM TO
JAIL HAS SPENT SEVERAL MILLION
DOLLARS ATTACKING NOT DON
BLANKENSHIP, BUT EVAN JENKINS
AND PATRICK MORRISSEY, BECAUSE
THEY FEAR JENKINS AND PERHAPS
PATRICK MORRISSEY, BUT JENKINS
CAN BEAT MANCHIN IN THE FALL,
NOW HE IS SPENDING MONEY TO PUT
HIMSELF IN THE LEAD.
>> THE OTHER IS A SPLIT, THEY
CAN SPLIT THE VOTE GIVING
BLANKENSHIP THIS WIN, BUT THEN
IT COMES DOWN TO G.O.P.
LEADERSHIP.
WHY ARE WE IN THIS POSITION?
THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
ASKING.
WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO
ACCOMPLISH.
THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF
COALESCING IN MAKING THIS NOT
HAPPEN IN THIS FASHION, AND THIS
IS WHY WE LOOK FUNNY AT THE
G.O.P. ESTABLISHMENT THAT ONCE
AGAIN THEY SHOULD BE SOMETHING
THAT SHOULD BE A FIGHTING FIGHT
BY A STRONG REPUBLICAN END
AGAINST MANCHIN COULD WIN.
WE ARE NOT EVEN THERE.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE G.O.P.
>> I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU
MORE, THAT'S WHY I PERSONALLY
STEPPED UP AND CONTRIBUTED TO
THE JENKINS CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE I
FELT THAT HE WAS THE BEST
CANDIDATE, BUT YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
A WEST VIRGINIAN, BUT I BELIEVE
THAT WEST VIRGINIA IS A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR US.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIRGINIAN
BALLOT, THE GENERIC REPUBLICAN'S
