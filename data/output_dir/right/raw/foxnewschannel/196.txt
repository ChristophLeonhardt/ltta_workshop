1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,652
HE IS CHALLENGING INCUMBENT JOE

2
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:06,019
DONNELLY.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,188
BRIAN: THREE WEEKS TO THE

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,590
MIDTERM, NEW POLL FINDS

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:12,092
DEMOCRATS UP IN THE SO-CALLED

6
00:00:12,093 --> 00:00:13,994
GENERIC CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT.

7
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,063
STEVE: PRESIDENT TRUMP SINGING A

8
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:18,031
DIFFERENT TUNE QUOTE, THE CROWDS

9
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:20,400
AT MY RALLY ARE BIGGER THAN EVER

10
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,936
BEFORE, INCLUDING THE 2016

11
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:23,303
ELECTION.

12
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:25,372
NEVER AN EMPTY SEAT IN THESE

13
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:25,806
LARGE VENUES.

14
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:27,774
MANY WATCHING LARGE SCREENS

15
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:28,942
INSIDE.

16
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,644
ENTHUSIASM AND SPIRIT IS THROUGH

17
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:31,345
THE ROOF.

18
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:33,614
SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING,

19
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:33,914
WATCH.

20
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:36,216
HERE TO WEIGH IN, FORMER SPEAKER

21
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:37,885
OF THE HOUSE AND AUTHOR OF

22
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,053
TRUMP'S AMERICA, NEWT GINGRICH.

23
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:41,288
>> GOOD MORNING.

24
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,190
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

25
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:44,658
>> WE'RE DOING OKAY.

26
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,026
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING SOMETHING

27
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,194
BIG IS HAPPEN, WATCH.

28
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:48,896
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

29
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:50,631
>> I WAS JUST IN SEATTLE,

30
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:51,698
DALLAS, DES MOINES.

31
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,635
MY SENSE IS THAT THE KAVANAUGH

32
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:57,671
FIGHT GALVANIZED CONSERVATIVES

33
00:00:57,672 --> 00:00:59,273
AND INDEPENDENTS.

34
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:00,774
REMINDED THEM HOW RADICAL AND

35
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:03,243
HOW DISHONEST THE DEMOCRATS ARE.

36
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:04,978
AND ALSO REMINDED THE COUNTRY

37
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,780
THAT POLITICS IN THE END IS A

38
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:07,514
TEAM SPORT.

39
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:09,950
THAT IF A CANDIDATE LIKE

40
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,552
BREDESEN IN TENNESSEE IS GOING

41
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:13,554
TO VOTE FOR SCHUMER HE IS

42
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:15,756
FUNCTIONALLY A LIBERAL.

43
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:22,296
IF SINEMA IN ARIZONA IS VOTING

44
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:24,698
FOR SCHUMER SHE IS FUNCTIONALLY

45
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:25,666
A LIBERAL.

46
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,434
PEOPLE LOOKED UP AND SAID OH, I

47
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:28,168
GET IT TWO TEAMS.

48
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:29,636
THERE IS THE RADICAL LEFT TEAM.

49
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,405
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT

50
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,440
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES.

51
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:35,208
WELL, NORTH DAKOTA WENT 16 OUT

52
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,244
OF THE 17 LAST ELECTIONS FOR THE

53
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:38,512
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL

54
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:38,879
CANDIDATE.

55
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,280
GUESS WHICH KIND OF JUDGE THEY

56
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:40,581
WANT?

57
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:42,616
SO THE KAVANAUGH THING I THINK

58
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,217
WAS VERY GALVANIZING.

59
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:45,452
I WANT TO MAKE A POINT TO

60
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:46,486
EVERYBODY THAT IS WATCHING

61
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:49,556
BECAUSE IT IS SO ABSURD.

62
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:50,757
"THE WASHINGTON POST" POLL,

63
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,159
LET'S DISCUSS HILLARY CLINTON'S

64
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,727
SECOND YEAR AS PRESIDENT, OKAY?

65
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:54,995
BECAUSE THAT POLL TOLD US SHE

66
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:57,264
WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT.

67
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,865
THE 538 PEOPLE, ELECTION MORNING

68
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:01,234
SAID THE ODDS ARE 71% THAT

69
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,503
HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE

70
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:03,870
PRESIDENT.

71
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,671
CHARLIE COOK SAID THE

72
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,206
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO LOSE

73
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:07,341
FIVE TO SEVEN SEATS IN THE

74
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:08,642
SENATE AND LOSE CONTROL OF THE

75
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:08,976
SENATE.

76
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:11,011
THESE PEOPLE WERE ALL WRONG.

77
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:12,746
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT

78
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,481
CLEARER THAN THAT THE VERY SAME

79
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:17,417
PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONG ARE WRONG.

80
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:20,020
I DON'T KNOW YET WHAT IS GOING

81
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:20,754
TO HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE.

82
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:23,256
I THINK IT'S A HARD-FOUGHT

83
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:23,557
FIGHT.

84
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:24,725
IN THE SENATE I BELIEVE WE WILL

85
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:25,792
KEEP THE SENATE.

86
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,728
WE WILL GAIN SEATS?

87
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:28,395
THE SENATE.

88
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:30,097
SENATOR McCONNELL HAS DONE

89
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:31,865
AMAZING JOB WITH JUDGES AND

90
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,967
AMAZING JOB OF RECRUITING AND

91
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:34,401
FUND-RAISING.

92
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:38,505
I THINK THE SENATE BASICALLY IN

93
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:39,873
TERMS OF CONTROL IS OVER.

94
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,342
SCHUMER WILL BE MINORITY LEADER.

95
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:43,677
McCONNELL WILL BE MAJORITY

96
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:44,011
LEADER.

97
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,313
YOU CAN ARGUE WHETHER WE PICK UP

98
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:50,617
TWO SEATS, THREE SEATS OR FIVE

99
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:53,854
SEATS BUT WE'LL KEEP UP SENATE.

100
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:55,522
BRIAN: ON LABOR DAY THE SENATE

101
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,257
WAS IN JEOPARDY.

102
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,558
538 NIXED THEIR CREDIBILITY.

103
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,027
THEY HAVE HAD IMPRESSIVE SHOWS

104
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:02,963
IN THE PAST.

105
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:04,498
538 80% CHANCE REPUBLICANS HOLD

106
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,832
THE SENATE.

107
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,534
80% CHANCE THEY LOSE THE HOUSE?

108
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:07,934
>> YEAH.

109
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:11,471
I THINK THAT 80% IS TOO HIGH.

110
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,407
I THINK THERE IS POSSIBILITY THE

111
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:14,675
DEMOCRATS WILL WIN THE HOUSE.

112
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:16,043
TALKING TO PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON

113
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:16,343
STATE.

114
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:17,711
I THINK WE WIN THE THREE

115
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:18,445
CRITICAL RACES THERE.

116
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:20,180
I TALKING TO PEOPLE IN TEXAS

117
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:20,547
YESTERDAY.

118
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:24,317
IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE BETO

119
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,986
O'ROURKE MYTHOLOGY IS

120
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:27,320
DISAPPEARING.

121
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:30,290
BECOMING AS TED CRUZ SAID THE

122
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,994
OTHER DAY, COMRADE BETO, ONCE

123
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:36,830
AGAIN CLEAR THAT TEXAS WILL BE A

124
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,532
VERY, VERY REPUBLICAN DEBATE.

125
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,534
THE GOVERNOR HAD A WONDERFUL

126
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:40,867
DEBATE.

127
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:44,538
SHE IS THE RIGHT PERSON THE

128
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,739
POLLING SAYS WE'RE PULLING AHEAD

129
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,206
IN IOWA.

130
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:48,475
I THINK IT WILL BE HARD FOUGHT.

131
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:49,409
REPUBLICANS WILL LOSE SEATS IN

132
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:49,843
THE HOUSE.

133
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:51,445
I'M NOT CONVINCED THEY WILL LOSE

134
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:52,479
THE HOUSE.

135
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,114
KEVIN McCARTHY, MAJORITY

136
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,450
LEADER NEW PROPOSAL, TO FUND THE

137
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,452
BORDER, GIVE US SECURITY FROM

138
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,721
MS-13, GIVE US SECURITY FROM

139
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:01,855
FENTANYL, AND COMMITMENT TO VOTE

140
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:04,024
ON THAT, FOR DECEMBER, I THINK

141
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,692
BRINGS UP THE ISSUE THE

142
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,928
DEMOCRATS ARE MOST AFRAID OF.

143
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:09,229
THEY'RE FOR OPEN BORDER, THEY'RE

144
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,631
FOR SANCTUARY CITIES.

145
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:13,033
THEY'RE FOR ABOLISHING I.C.E.

146
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,801
THOSE ARE ALL TREMENDOUSLY

147
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:15,602
UNPOPULAR ISSUES.

148
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,171
AND IF THAT IS WHAT THIS IS

149
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,806
FOUGHT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS,

150
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,675
I THINK THEY MAY WELL LOSE ANY

151
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:22,843
EFFORT OR OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE

152
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:23,543
CONTROL THE HOUSE.

153
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:25,145
AINSLEY: DEMOCRATS ARE TELLING

154
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:25,846
OTHER DEMOCRATS DON'T MENTION

155
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:27,314
THAT WHEN YOU GO OUT ON THE

156
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:28,315
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

157
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:30,250
DON'T MENTION YOU'RE FOR OPEN

158
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:30,584
BORDERS.

159
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:32,419
HOW MUCH IS IT HELPING WITH THE

160
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,553
PRESIDENT, WE SEE HIM OUT THERE

161
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,388
AT THE RALLIES EVERY NIGHT,

162
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,790
CAMPAIGNING FOR A REPUBLICAN IN

163
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,525
TIGHT RACES, HOW MUCH DOES THAT

164
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:38,825
HELP?

165
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:41,428
>> I THINK IT HELPS ENORMOUSLY

166
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:42,395
BOTH BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP

167
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:44,097
ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE THE

168
00:04:44,098 --> 00:04:45,499
BEST MESSENGER WE HAVE.

169
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,367
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HIM DEMOLISH

170
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:49,002
THE DEMOCRATS GOVERNMENT-RUN

171
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,338
HEALTH PLAN OR LISTEN TO HIM

172
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,806
TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS DESIRE

173
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,941
FOR OPEN BORDERS, OR DIFFERENCE

174
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:55,609
IN THE ECONOMY.

175
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,345
THE TRUMP ECONOMY IS THE LOWEST

176
00:04:58,346 --> 00:04:59,546
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT IN

177
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:01,148
HISTORY, LOWEST LATINO

178
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,149
UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY.

179
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,117
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE

180
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:05,986
TAXES, PUT PEOPLE BACK ON FOOD

181
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:06,553
STAMPS.

182
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:08,255
NOBODY SAYS THAT BETTER THAN

183
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:09,022
TRUMP.

184
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:09,923
HE MOBILIZES THE BASE.

185
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,491
THAT IS IMPORTANT.

186
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:14,194
IN AN OFF YEAR ELECTION, LIKE

187
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,962
THIS, IN MIDTERM ELECTION THE

188
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:17,831
BIGGER TURNOUT ON YOUR SIDE THE

189
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:20,634
