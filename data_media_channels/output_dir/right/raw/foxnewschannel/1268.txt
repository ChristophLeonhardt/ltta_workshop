1
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:03,869
PROSECUTORS AND A POLITICIZED

2
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:05,004
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,506
BUT THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE

4
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:08,106
BUT THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGL

5
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:09,241
ANGLE.

6
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:12,244
A LOT OF US GREW UP TO HAVE A

7
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:13,612
ROMANTICIZED VIEW OF FEDERAL

8
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:14,380
PROSECUTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,584
THEY WERE ALL LIKE ELIOT NESS IN

10
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,019
THE UNTOUCHABLES.

11
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,253
TRUTH, JUSTICE AND THE AMERICAN

12
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:21,620
WAY.

13
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,656
IT WAS ABOUT LOCKING UP THE BAD

14
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,024
GUYS AND PROTECTING THE REST OF

15
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,258
US.

16
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:27,726
AND, THERE ARE MANY DEDICATED

17
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:29,628
MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY

18
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,030
SERVING AS ASSISTANT U.S.

19
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,032
ATTORNEY WHO ARE DOING JUST THAT

20
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:33,499
ATTORNEY WHO ARE DOING JUST THA

21
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:34,133
THAT.

22
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,469
BUT SADLY, WE HAVE ALSO SEEN IN

23
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,671
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES IN RECENT

24
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,538
YEARS OF PROSECUTIONS OF

25
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:41,540
PROMINENT FIGURES THAT SEEM TO

26
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,843
HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.

27
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,579
PROSECUTIONS THAT RESULTED IN

28
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,713
HUGE MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE.

29
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:52,851
ONE SUCH CASE WAS THAT OF

30
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:54,453
CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER, AUTHOR,

31
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,554
AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND DINESH

CONVICTION STEMMING FROM A

35
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:04,730
BUNDLED CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.

36
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,068
OBAMA IS A U.S. ATTORNEY WENT

37
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,636
FOR BROKE AGAINST DESOUSA IN A

38
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:13,672
CASE THAT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN

39
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:15,874
DISPOSED OF WITH A FINE, AND

40
00:01:15,874 --> 00:01:17,076
SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

41
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,778
THIS IS DESOUSA WHO I SPOKE WITH

42
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:20,679
EXCLUSIVELY.

43
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,950
>> WITH REGARD TO BARRERA, I SEE

44
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,453
HIM AS WELL AS ERIC HOLDER AS

45
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,421
PART OF THIS OBAMA TEAM OF GOONS

46
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:32,057
IF YOU WILL THAT WAS UNLEASHED

00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:34,860
TO GET ME IN RETALIATION FOR THE

48
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,527
MOVIE I MADE ABOUT OBAMA.

49
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:43,869
AND I THINK FOR VERIZON GOAL

50
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,638
WAS, BY GETTING A FELLOW INDIAN,

51
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,039
HE WOULD ENDEAR HIMSELF TO THE

52
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,540
OBAMA TEAM.

53
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,843
THIS WOULD BE FILED UNDER THE

54
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:57,049
KARMA IS A LEAP DEPARTMENT.

00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,062
REEDUCATION.

62
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,263
WHEN REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF

U.S. POLITICS.

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,961
THERE'S A NEW TERM THAT'S COMING

96
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,696

ELECTION BY THE PEOPLE.

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,481
THESE ARE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED

129
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,582
OPPORTUNISTS WHO USE THEIR

130
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,584

131
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:49,455
ENRICHMENT TO FURTHER THEIR

133
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,659

00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,871
FOR LYING TO INVESTIGATORS.

00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:07,072
TRUMP RECENTLY PARDON HIM,

140
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:07,906

00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,575
HAVE DONE LONG BEFORE LEAVING

142
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,275

143
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,945
DO YOU REMEMBER WHO DECIDED TO

00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:22,087
WHOM DID CALL ME CHOOSE A

149
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,255
SPECIAL COUNSEL?

150
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,891
HIS OLD CHUM, PATRICK FITZGERALD

FITZGERALD.

153
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,895
IT'S ALL SO INCESTUOUS.

154
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,463
NOW HE IS A PARTNER AT MY OLD

155
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:34,166
LAW FIRM AND HE'S REPRESENTING

156
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,067
WHOM?

157
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,736
JIM COMEY AND HIS DEALINGS WITH

158
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,238
SPECIAL COUNSEL, BOB MUELLER.

159
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,672
THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY WHERE

160
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,307
MANY OF THE SAME FIGURES WHO

161
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,276
HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED BY MEDIA

162
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:45,277
ELITES ARE BACK AT WORK USING

163
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,847
THEIR POSITION AND THEIR

164
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:49,615
PEDIGREE, AND AN ONGOING EFFORT

165
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,852
TO PURGE THE COUNTRY OF

166
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,654
PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.

167
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,256
WHAT STARTED AS CONCERNS ABOUT

168
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,657
RUSSIAN COLLUSION HAS NOW

169
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:01,059
MORPHED INTO AN EVER-CHANGING

170
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:01,660
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

171
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,661
NARRATIVE.

172
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,363
ALL BECAUSE TRUMP FIRED SOMEONE

173
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,130
WHO HE WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY

174
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,799
PERMITTED TO FIRE FOR ANY REASON

175
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,400
PERMITTED TO FIRE FOR ANY REASO

176
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,034
REASON.

177
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,869
IN FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS, THE

178
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:16,241
GOVERNMENT HAS LIMITLESS

179
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,110
BUDGETS, SUBPOENA POWER AND AN

180
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,478
ARMY OF PROSECUTORS.

181
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,280
SO TARGETS SHOULD NOT BE CHOSEN

182
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,016
OR ELIMINATED ON THE BASIS OF

183
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,884
THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS, NOR

184
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:26,919
BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED BIG

185
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,455
FISH WHOSE PROSECUTION COULD PAY

186
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:32,057
BIG TIME AND A BIG DIVIDENDS

187
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,661
DOWN THE ROAD.

188
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,528
THIS IS NEITHER JUST NOR

189
00:06:36,528 --> 00:00:00,000
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW.
