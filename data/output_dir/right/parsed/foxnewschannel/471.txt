GREG: SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
FROM THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS?
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S
TESTIMONY WAS COMPELLING, BUT IT
WAS ALSO CONFUSING.
AT TIMES IT WAS LIKE WATCHING
PEOPLE'S COURT, RACHEL MITCHELL
ASKING DIRECT QUESTIONS, GETTING
DIRECT ANSWERS, AND JUST WHEN IT
WAS GETTING SOMEWHERE, THE
DEMOCRATS WOULD START TALKING.
WE'D GO FROM A PROCEDURAL LINE
OF FACT FINDING TO HIGH
EMOTIONAL DRAMA.
BUT THEN THIS GUY BROKE THROUGH.
>> I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT
YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS GUY.
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS.
THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW.
THIS IS HELL.
THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY THE
ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO COME
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS.
GREG: HE REMINDS ME WHEN I'M AT
THE RENTAL CAR COUNTER AND I
WANTED THE CONVERTIBLE SEBRING,
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY
CONVERTIBLES, BUT THAT WAS
AMAZING.
ANY WAY, AT THE END OF THIS, DID
WE LEARN ANY NEW FACTS ABOUT A
35-YEAR-OLD INCIDENT?
LOOK, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED.
I DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH
KAVANAUGH OR FORD.
WILL AN FBI INVESTIGATION GIVE
US MORE ANSWERS?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY BELIEVE
THEIR STORIES.
SO HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW,
POLITICAL TRIBALISM NOW INCLUDES
PUBLIC ACTS OF PERSONAL
DESTRUCTION.
IT IS GHULLISH.
THE DEMOCRATS COULD HAVE AVOIDED
THIS SHOW TRIAL BY ACTING
IMMEDIATELY WHEN THEY FIRST GOT
THE LETTER INSTEAD OF SITTING ON
IT WHICH LED TO A TWISTED CIRCUS
THAT RUINED REPUTATIONS,
HUMILIATED VICTIMS AND THEIR
FAMILIES.
THE LESSON IN POLITICS,
COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS NOW TOTALLY
ACCEPTABLE.
WHO CARES IF YOU DESTROY A
FAMILY OR TWO, YOU STILL BLOCKED
THAT SEAT, GOOD FOR YOU.
WE LOOKED HARD TO FIND A GROUP
OF PEOPLE MORE CIVIL THAN THE
HEARINGS.
HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND.
MAYBE IT IS NOT SO BAD, BUT
MAYBE MICHAEL MOORE WAS RIGHT
AFTER ALL.
TIME TO MOVE TO CANADA.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE
HEARINGS IN GENERAL?
OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE DOING A
WEEK-LONG FBI INVESTIGATION.
GENERAL THOUGHTS ON THIS,
MADISON, AS A LAWYER?
>> I THINK LINDSEY GRAHAM REALLY
DID SAY IT BEST WHEN HE SAID YOU
WANT A FAIR PROCESS, YOU CAME TO
THE WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME
MY FRIEND.
NOTHING ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN
FAIR.
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET A SEARCH
WARRANT OR ARREST WARRANT FOR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WE HAVE AN FBI INVESTIGATION.
TAXPAYER MONEY IS FUNDING THAT.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY MORE
INFORMATION IN A WEEK.
I WOULD BET MY LIFE ON THAT.
THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE GOING
TO INTERVIEW MR. JUDGE.
HE ALREADY PRESENTED HIS
STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF
PERJURY.
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO
CHANGE HIS STORY.
THAT WOULD BE INSANE.
GREG: YEAH.
TYRUS, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON
THIS?
DO YOU THINK THE TESTIMONY
CHANGED ANY MINDS?
>> NO, I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE
WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY NOW.
NOBODY'S MINDS ARE BEING CHANGED
PERIOD ON ANYTHING.
I DON'T THINK EITHER WAY BOTH
PEOPLE WERE CREDIBLE.
I THINK THE CRIME IS THAT THEY
JUST HAPPENED TO BE INVOLVED
WITH OUR SENATE.
I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE.
>> I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE.
I THINK THAT IF NEVER THERE WAS
A TIME NOW FOR TERM LIMITS ON
THE SENATE, IT IS NOW.
GREG: UH-HUH.
>> WHETHER YOU'RE --
>> WHETHER YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN
OR A DEMOCRAT, ENOUGH.
THE FACT IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE
HAVE 51 TO 50 VOTES.
THAT WE HAVE ALL DEMOCRATS ON
ONE SIDE -- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU
ARE ELECTED FOR.
YOUR JOB WAS TO GET THE BEST
DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
NOT YOUR OWN THING.
ALL WE'RE SEEING EVEN AFTER
TODAY WHEN THE DEAL WAS MADE
BASICALLY WE'RE GOING TO PASS
HIM THROUGH, RIGHTFULLY SO,
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO SAY OTHERWISE, AND
WE'RE GOING TO STILL DO AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
GREG: UH-HUH.
>> SO THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR
THE DEMOCRATS IS TO SHOW OF GOOD
FAITH FOR MEETING THEM HALFWAY
WAS TO VOTE YES.
WE ALL AGREE WE'RE GOING TO VOTE
HIM THROUGH AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO INVESTIGATE IT.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MESSAGE
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE
THESE -- BUT NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
THEY REALLY WANT.
IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT IS THE CIVIL WAR IN THE
SENATE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH.
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHETHER THIS WOMAN WAS ASSAULTED
OR NOT.
WE BELIEVE BOTH PEOPLE BUT I
HAVE TO SAY NO OR YES.
REGARDLESS OF YOUR PARTY
AFFILIATION, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,
WE NEED TO START GETTING NEW
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN
THERE AND INDEPENDENTS IN THERE
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY
GOING TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE AND
NOT THEIR SELF.
IT WAS DISGRACEFUL.
GREG: KAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?
>> MY THOUGHTS?
GREG: YES.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ALL OF THE
CERTAINLY MILLIONS IF NOT
TRILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WATCH ME
AND JUST --
GREG: YEAH.
>> AND THEY DECIDE WHAT TO THINK
BASED ON WHAT I THINK BECAUSE
THEY ADMIRE ME SO MUCH.
>> OH I'VE SEEN IT.
>> BUT I REALLY JUST DON'T -- I
DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T THERE.
I DON'T KNOW.
GREG: DO YOU KNOW, KAT?
>> SAME AS LAST WEEK I FEEL LIKE
I'M WANDERING AROUND IN A FOREST
AND I SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE ON
BOTH SIDES WHO CLAIM TO KNOW FOR
SURE AND THEY ARE SO -- ABOUT IT
ON BOTH SIDES AND I THINK THAT A
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DECIDING BASED
ON PARTISANSHIP.
THEY ARE NOT DECIDING BASED ON
THE FACTS BECAUSE BASED ON THE
FACTS HOW COULD YOU KNOW.
GREG: NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.
>> NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.
GREG: THE ONE THING I HAVE
LEARNED CHARLIE IS THAT NATURE
OF MEMORY IS IMPERFECT AND WE --
I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY BELIEVE
THEIR STORIES AND BOTH STORIES
ARE PROBABLY FLAWED.
BUT I DON'T KNOW TO ECHO KAT,
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE PROGRESS
THAT WE'RE MAKING IS IN THE AREA
OF UNDERSTANDING MEMORY OVER
TIME, THAT WE HAVE TO START
THINKING ABOUT LIKE WHAT IS TRUE
IN SOMEBODY'S HEAD IS NOT TRUE
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S.
>> I DON'T TRUST MY MEMORY FROM
THIS MORNING.
GREG: NEITHER DO I.
>> MUCH LESS LAST WEEK.
GREG: I HAD TO TELL YOU TO PUT
ON PANTS.
>> AND I DON'T EVEN DO ANY DRUGS
ANYMORE.
GREG: YEAH.
ANYMORE.
IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS.
>> BUT NO, I WOULD SAY ACTUALLY
I DID CHANGE MY MIND LISTENING
TO THE TESTIMONY.
GOING IN, I THOUGHT THAT
DR. FORD WAS A POLITICAL -- I
THOUGHT SHE WAS POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS TRYING TO TAKE
OUT THIS GUY AND DOING
EVERYTHING THAT SHE COULD TO
JUST -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE
FIRST TIME SHE EVER UTTERED HIS
NAME TO ANYBODY WAS AFTER HE HAD
BEEN FLOATED AS A POTENTIAL
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE.
LISTENING TO HER TESTIMONY, I
FOUND IT RIVETING AND I FOUND IT
TOTALLY BELIEVABLE AND I CAME
AWAY THINKING MY GOODNESS
OBVIOUSLY THIS WOMAN IS NOT WHO
I THOUGHT SHE WAS.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, NOT
TO DO EXACTLY WHAT TYRUS SAID,
HE'S SICK AND TIRED OF, BUT THEN
YOU LISTEN TO BRETT KAVANAUGH
AND WHAT HE SAID, AND I TOTALLY
BELIEVED HIM.
GREG: YEAH.
>> AT THIS POINT YOU CAN'T PROVE
IT.
YOU CAN'T KNOW.
SO ALL YOU CAN DO THEN IS
EVALUATE ALL THE OTHER EVIDENCE.
GREG: RIGHT.
>> WHEN YOU EVALUATE ALL THE
OTHER EVIDENCE, NO RATIONAL
PERSON CAN COME DOWN ON ANY
DECISIONS BUT THAT THEY DIDN'T
PROVE THEIR CASE.
GREG: RIGHT.
>> ONE THING I WOULD SAY THAT'S
DIFFERENT TODAY AND I THINK IT
IS A VERY GOOD THING IN AMERICA,
THAT IS DIFFERENT TODAY, 30
YEARS AGO -- OR 20 YEARS AGO,
BILL CLINTON WOULD HAVE SENT HIS
WAR DOGS OUT TO CALL HER TRAILER
TRASH AND SAY THAT OH YEAH YOU
CAN BRING -- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
GET ANYBODY TO SAY ANYTHING, YOU
JUST DRAG A $20 BILL THROUGH A
TRAILER PARK.
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE NOW.
GREG: YEAH, YEAH.
>> THIS WOMAN, WHETHER
REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, BY IN
LARGE, YOU CAN'T FIND A SINGLE
PERSON ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE
WHO TRASHED HER OR DID ANYTHING
BUT SAID WE WANT TO HEAR HER
OUT.
IT WAS TOTALLY RESPECTFUL.
AND THAT IS A TREMENDOUS
IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CLINTON
YEARS WHEN PAULA JONES WAS
CALLED TRAILER TRASH AND A LIAR.
GREG: RIGHT.
>> I HAVE A QUESTION, GREG.
YOU NEVER GET ASKED QUESTIONS
BUT I HAVE QUESTION FOR YOU
BESIDES YOU ARE ALWAYS NEGATIVE
TO ME ON THE MONOLOGUE, BUT
FORGET THAT.
IS IT POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GOES
BACK TO THE LEAK FOR ME REAL
QUICK.
GREG: YEAH.
>> IS IT POSSIBLE THAT FEINSTEIN
SAT ON THIS BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
THINK IT HAD ENOUGH CREDIBILITY?
GREG: FEINSTEIN IS DENYING IT
THAT SHE LEAKED IT.
