00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Hi, I’m Steven S.
DeKnight, director

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,150
of “Pacific Rim Uprising."

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,650
"Warning."

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,420
All right.

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,170
So here we are in Sydney,
where we have the introduction

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,490
of Obsidian Fury.

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,790
We wanted the introduction
of this rogue Jaeger

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,510
to be as spectacular
as we could make it.

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,490
So we picked the Sydney
Opera House as a backdrop.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,730
"Gipsy: This is command.

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,430
Be advised that we
have a rogue Jaeger."

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,110
As Obsidian Fury

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,140
walks past that
cruise ship, that’s

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,660
actually right
outside my hotel room

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,570
that I spent the entire time in.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,360
This part right here, where
the holographic missile

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,550
goes through the
Conn-Pod, we really

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,750
wanted in this next
installment of the movie

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,890
to take the outside and make
it interact with the inside

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,530
so it didn’t feel like you were
cutting inside a completely

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,500
separate room, that it was very
organic and very connected.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,930
Here I had to
disable Gipsy briefly

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,730
to give Obsidian Fury a
chance to destroy those guns

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,090
and target Mako.

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,610
At one point, there was a
much more involved back story

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,930
of what Mako was doing,
that she was actually

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,320
vetting the drone
program, traveling around

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,470
the world making sure
everything was all right

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,920
before she gave her approval.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,160
That got very much streamlined
as the story continued

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,160
and then we pared it down.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,070
This entire action sequence,
we really went back and forth

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,650
and did a lot of work
with the visual effects

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,800
team, Double Negative,
and my visual effects

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,430
supervisor Peter Chiang.

36
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,100
In this exchange right
here, this first exchange

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,590
is something D Neg pitched.

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,030
And I thought it was fantastic.

39
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,760
D Neg also pitched
this chest canon

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
that Obsidian Fury
uses, which I thought

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,479
was a very, very cool idea.

42
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,760
And I wanted to
give Obsidian Fury

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,000
a couple of brutal,
intimidating weapons.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,960
So we came up with this
idea of plasma chainsaws.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,420
So that it’s just not a sword,
but an actual chainsaw.

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,280
We shot all of this
on location in Sydney.

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,310
Including the stuff inside
the Conn-Pod was also at Fox

48
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,380
Studios in Sydney.

49
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,140
This idea right here,
slicing a building in half

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,700
with a chainsaw, was
actually Mary Parent’s idea,

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,440
the producer.

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,280
She wanted to see
something that we

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,030
hadn’t seen in the
first movie and pitched

54
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,130
this idea of cutting a building
in half, which I loved.

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,300
It was not a cheap bit.

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,990
So it was great that it
actually came from a producer.

57
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,310
Mako’s helicopter
getting hit was

58
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,540
something I had pitched
from the beginning.

59
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,530
Gipsy’s gravity sling
was another weapon.

60
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,120
We wanted all the
Yeager’s to have

61
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,400
a Y button, a special ability.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,900
We wanted to give Gipsy
a really cool upgrade.

63
00:03:14,900 --> 00:00:00,000
So we came up with this
idea of a gravity sling.
