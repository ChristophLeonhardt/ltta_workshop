COUNTRY WITH THAT BECAUSE WE

4
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:06,279
DON'T NEED IT HERE ANYMORE.

5
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:09,582
>> JAMES MCDERMOTT IS ON THE

6
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:11,084

00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,602
WITH YOU OFFICER MCDERMOTT.

21
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:30,103
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THOSE AT

22
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:32,005
HOME WHO MAY NOT BE AS

23
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:33,273
FAMILIAR AS THOSE OF US WHO

24
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:34,574
LIVE IN THIS AREA AND OTHER

25
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:36,443
AREAS OF THE COUNTRY ARE,

26
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:38,078
ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD CALL

27
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:41,515
THESE INDIVIDUALS ANIMALS.

28
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,216
>> THEY ARE A HEINOUS GROUP.

29
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:44,885
A STREET GANG.

30
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,554
DOMESTIC TERRORIST IN MY

31
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:47,988
OPINION.

32
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:50,958
THEY NOT ONLY ARE INVOLVED

33
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,760
IN DRUG TRAFFICKING, HUMAN

34
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,295
TRAFFICKING, PROSTITUTION.

35
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:57,497
THEY COMMIT MURDERS, RAPES.

36
00:00:57,497 --> 00:00:58,999
ROBBERIES, BURGLARIES.

37
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,834
ANY PENAL LAW CRIME CAN YOU

38
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:01,902
FIGURE OUT.

39
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:04,004
THEY HAVE COMMITTED AND

40
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,006
CRIMES WHEN THEY DO KILL

41
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:07,941
SOMEBODY, IT'S USUALLY A

42
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:09,977
MUTILATION A BEHEADING, A

43
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,945
STABBING BODIES, HUNDREDS

44
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,548
AND THOUSANDS OF TIMES.

45
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:17,584
THEY ARE A DESPICABLE GROUP.

46
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:19,353
>> Martha: THEY PURPOSEFULLY

47
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:20,254
DISMEMBER BODIES AND LEAVE

48
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,421
THEM IN CONDITION THAT IN

49
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,123
SOME CASES THEY ARE

50
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:24,158
COMPLETELY UNRECOGNIZABLE.

51
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:24,491
CORRECT?

52
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:26,160
>> UNIDENTIFIABLE TO THE

53
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,493
FAMILY.

54
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:30,430
YES.

55
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,031
>> Martha: ALLI, DO YOU

56
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,633
AGREE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

57
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,234
COULD CORRECTLY BE CALLED

58
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:35,169
ANIMALS FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR.

59
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:36,436
>> FIRST, I HAVE TO SAY

60
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:37,571
THREE THINGS, MARTHA.

61
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:39,039
FIRST AND FOREMOST OUR

62
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,274
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GOES

63
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,775
OUT TO THE FAMILIES OF THESE

64
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:42,109
VICTIMS.

65
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:42,776
THE TRAGEDY.

66
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,945
THE ANGUISH, IT'S JUST

67
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:45,279
AWFUL.

68
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,280
NUMBER TWO I WANT TO THANK

69
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,881
THE MEN AND WOMEN HAD BLUE

70
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:48,916
WHO ARE SERVING AND

71
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,550
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES IN

72
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,584
LONG ISLAND AND ACROSS THE

73
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:51,785
COUNTRY AND ARE REALLY

74
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:52,719
ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM HEAD

75
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,021
ON AND, NUMBER THREE, WE

76
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,222
WANT TO REALLY THINK ABOUT

77
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:59,260
WHAT'S THE SOLUTION HERE?

78
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,461
BECAUSE MS-13 IF THEY ARE A

79
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:01,428
VIOLENT CRIMINAL THEY DO NOT

80
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,930
BELONG IN OUR COUNTRY FULL

81
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,230
STOP.

82
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,465
AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE

83
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:08,102
OFTEN PREYING ON IMMIGRANT

84
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:08,502
COMMUNITIES.

85
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:09,303
THE SOLUTION HERE TO MAKE

86
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:10,304
SURE THAT IMMIGRANT

87
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,238
COMMUNITIES ARE TRUSTING LAW

88
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:12,072
ENFORCEMENT AND THEY ARE THE

89
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:13,374
ONES WHO ARE REPORTING THOSE

90
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:14,975
CRIMES AND SAYING YOU KNOW

91
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:15,276
WHAT?

92
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:16,243
THAT PERSON OVER THERE, THAT

93
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:18,012
IS A HARDENED CRIMINAL WHO I

94
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,914
DO NOT WANT IN MY COMMUNITY,

95
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:21,248
SO THESE THE KINDS OF

96
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,650
SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO BE

97
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,085
FOCUSING ON AND I HOPE AND I

98
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:25,019
THINK THE MAJORITY OF

99
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,387
AMERICANS HOPE THAT WE CAN

100
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:27,722
REALLY MOVE BEYOND THE NAME

101
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:29,757
CALLING AND TALK ABOUT

102
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:30,191
SOLUTIONS.

103
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:30,825
>> Martha: LET ME ASK YOU

104
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:31,492
ABOUT, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU

105
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:32,460
PROBABLY WERE SURPRISED WHEN

106
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,896
YOU HEARD THE BACKLASH BY

107
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:36,764
SOME IN THE MEDIA WHO WERE

108
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:38,800
VERY OFFENDED BY PRESIDENT

109
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,934
TRUMP'S COMMENT THE OTHER

110
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:42,370
DAY WHEN HE SAID THESE ARE

111
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:42,904
ANIMALS.

112
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:43,971
PEOPLE GAVE HIM A REALLY

113
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,773
HARD TIME FOR SAYING THAT.

114
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,141
SO, DO YOU AGREE WITH THEM?

115
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,310
>> WELL, I'M KIND OF

116
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,411
WONDERING HOT PRESIDENT IS

117
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,112
TALKING ABOUT ANYMORE WHEN

118
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,513
HE TALKS ABOUT IMMIGRANTS.

119
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,581
BECAUSE, REMEMBER, AT THE

120
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,515
BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR AND

121
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,883
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST

122
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:56,684
12 MONTHS, HE HAS BEEN

123
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:58,319
TALKING ABOUT A BILL OF LOVE

124
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,020
FOR DREAMERS.

125
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,421
HE RARELY TALKS ABOUT THAT

126
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:00,755
ANYMORE.

127
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,357
WE HAVE GOT A LEGITIMATE

128
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:03,157
DEBATE HAPPENING IN CONGRESS

129
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:03,825
THAT THE MAJORITY OF

130
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,259
AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO SEE

131
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,928
A SOLUTION FOR DREAMERS.

132
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,029
SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

133
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,197
A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO BRING

134
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:13,034
THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, BRING

135
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:14,335
CONGRESS TOGETHER AND FIND

136
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,270
SOLUTIONS THAT PROTECT

137
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,438
DREAMERS, SECURE OUR BORDER

138
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,540
AND, YES, MAKE SURE THAT THE

139
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,841
VIOLENT HARDENED CRIMINALS

140
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,409
THAT ARE MS-13 GANG MEMBERS

141
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,845
ARE NOT PART OF OUR

142
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:24,312
COMMUNITIES.

143
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:25,547
>> Martha: I WAS KIND OF

144
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:26,348
SURPRISED, OFFICER

145
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:27,716
MCDERMOTT, WHEN I HEARD THE

146
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:28,883
BACKLASH TO WHAT WAS SAID.

147
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:29,617
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IN

148
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:31,386
THAT STATEMENT WAS

149
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:33,188
ABSOLUTELY TALKING ABOUT

150
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:34,322
MS-13 GANG MEMBERS.

151
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:35,423
AND WHAT THEY HAD DONE TO

152
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,558
PEOPLE AND THE FACT THAT

153
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:39,494
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE IN

154
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:40,228
THIS COUNTRY.

155
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,264
YOU KNOW, SO, IN TERMS OF

156
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,532
THAT BACKLASH, AND WHAT DO

157
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:44,833
WE NEED TO DEFINE HERE IN

158
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,668
TERMS OF HOW WE ARE

159
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,603
>> GOING TO THE ANIMAL

160
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,539
STATEMENT, I BELIEVE THE

161
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,973
PRESIDENT TRIED TO CLEAR IT

162
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:53,942
UP TODAY AT THE ROUND TABLE

163
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,977
DISCUSSION THAT HE WAS

164
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:58,680
SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

165
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,481
THE MS-13 GANG.

166
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:01,349
HE WASN'T SPEAKING -- HE

167
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,083
DEFINITELY WASN'T SPEAKING

168
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,452
ABOUT THE EL SALVADORIAN

169
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:04,820
COMMUNITY.

170
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,354
I THINK HE IS AN EMOTIONAL

171
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:06,688
PERSON.

172
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:10,125
HE SHOOTS FROM THE HIP.

173
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,830
LIKE I SAID EARLIER TODAY,

174
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,598
THE PEOPLE TO ASK IF ANIMAL

175
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,834
WAS AN OKAY STATEMENT IS THE

176
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:20,668
VICTIM'S FAMILIES.

177
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:21,736
AND YOU SAW HOW THEY

178
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,004
RESPONDED.

179
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:23,471
>> Martha: YEAH.

180
00:04:23,471 --> 00:00:00,000
WE SAW EXACTLY HOW THEY
