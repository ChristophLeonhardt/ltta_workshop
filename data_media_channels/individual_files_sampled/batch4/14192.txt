I want to be very cautious here and explain in advance why oftentimes especially this time I find it hard to believe allegations of sexual misconduct this time pertaining to Ryan Seacrest I find it particularly difficult because I have met Ryan we also have mutual colleagues as well as a longtime friend of mine who dated him I do not know him well but I can say that from what I know of him from many people who do know him very well he seems to be a very decent human and that's why I want to talk about this particular celebrity sexual misconduct scandal more so than some of the others that have come and gone in the news cycle to give you a little bit of the background on the story Suzie Hardy who worked as seacrest personal stylist from 2007 to 2013 she was fired in 2013 after making complaints about harassment to ease HR department a network is a subsidiary of NBC Universal so NBC Universal hired an independent third party to conduct an investigation and found insufficient evidence to support the claims against secrets so this was back then and it has already been investigated case closed and this woman Susie Hardy is talking about it yet again making headlines so Ryan Seacrest of course felt compelled to address the rumor yet again after already going through an investigation many years prior Seacrest wrote a column on February 5th for The Hollywood Reporter entitled what happened after I was wrongly accused of harassment he states in the article that to have his workplace conduct questioned was absolutely gut-wrenching he writes that I've always aimed to treat all of my colleagues with honesty respect kindness and compassion yet I knew regardless of the confidence I had that there was no merit to the allegations my name would likely soon appear on the lists of those suspected of despicable words and deeds the pressures of our overflowing newsfeed would insist on it and he's absolutely right because in today's climate a claim is really all it takes an allegation is more than sufficient to destroy someone's career or livelihood or reputation all in one fell swoop the court of public opinion now has more power and prevalence than an actual court and due process and a subsequent judge of innocence or guilt so when is this going to stop when are we going to start listening to both sides not just the people who come out and make the complaint stop punishing people for standing up for themselves because one day you just might find yourself the subject of false claims like these and you are going to wish that the court of public opinion gave you just a little bit of grace and let the legal process do its job thanks for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary you want to hear more from us over here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.fafsa.gov emedia on the app store downloaded and you will have access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
