1
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,663
>> Tucker: BRETT KAVANAUGH AND

2
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:14,034
HIS WIFE ASHLEY APPEARED ON

3
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:14,701
"THE STORY" WITH

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,936
MARTHA MacCALLUM AN HOUR AGO

5
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:18,439
AND HE DENIED ALL ALLEGATIONS OF

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:19,907
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT RALLIED

7
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:23,277
AGAINST HIM.

8
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:24,812
>> Judge Kavanaugh: I'VE NEVER

9
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:25,779
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE, NOT

10
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:28,115
IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT EVER.

11
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,483
I'VE TREATED EVERYONE WITH

12
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:30,484
DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

13
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:31,418
LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN

14
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:33,887
THE BEST FOR MY WHOLE LIFE, THE

15
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:37,491
WOMEN WHO HAVE KNOWN ME SINCE

16
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,459
HIGH SCHOOL.

17
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,127
THEY SIGNED A LETTER FROM

18
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,595
HIGH SCHOOL SAYING I ALWAYS

19
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:43,931
TREATED THEM WITH DIGNITY AND

20
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:44,264
RESPECT.

21
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:47,334
>> Tucker: KAVANAUGH'S WIFE

22
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:48,502
CAME TO HIS DEFENSE AS WELL.

23
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:50,871
>> I KNOW BRETT, I'VE KNOWN HIM

24
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:54,842
FOR 17 YEARS AND THIS IS NOT AT

25
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,777
ALL -- IT'S REALLY HARD TO

26
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:57,111
BELIEVE.

27
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:59,813
HE'S DECENT AND KIND AND GOOD, I

28
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,015
AND I KNOW HIS HEART.

29
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:04,852
THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH

30
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:07,921
BREAD.

31
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:08,222
BRETT.

32
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:11,458
>> THEY LOOK IN PAIN, BOTH OF

33
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:11,759
THEM.

34
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,293
>> Martha: WATCHING IT AGAIN,

35
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:14,128
THIS IS REALLY HARD FOR THEM AND

36
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:16,063
I FELT LIKE THEY WERE BOTH KIND

37
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:17,732
OF JUST TAMPING DOWN THE TEARS.

38
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:20,034
THEY WERE THIS CLOSE TO CRYING.

39
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:24,271
I THINK THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

40
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,106
INCREDIBLY EMOTIONALLY

41
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:25,506
DEVASTATING.

42
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:27,508
I THINK THEY THOUGHT AND WE ALL

43
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:28,476
THOUGHT THAT FIRST DAY AT THE

44
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:29,710
HEARING WHEN DEMOCRATS TRIED TO

45
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,945
SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE HEARING THAT

46
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:32,413
IT COULDN'T REALLY GET ANY WORSE

47
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:33,381
THAN THAT, THEN THEY THINK THEY

48
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,316
ARE ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND

49
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,917
SUDDENLY THOSE ACCUSATIONS START

50
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:37,985
COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK.

51
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:40,621
I THINK IT WOULD WREAK HAVOC ON

52
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:40,955
ANYBODY.

53
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:43,224
THEY SEEM VERY SOLID TOGETHER

54
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:45,092
AND VERY UNITED IN THE EFFORT.

55
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:47,128
I SAID TO THEM, AT SOME POINT

56
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,096
DON'T YOU SAY, FORGET IT.

57
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:50,931
IT'S NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE, IT'S

58
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,032
TOO PAINFUL.

59
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:56,337
BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

60
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:57,038
>> Tucker: FOR A JOB THAT PAYS

61
00:01:57,038 --> 00:02:01,075
LESS THAN THE AVERAGE LAWYER

62
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:01,442
SOMETIMES.

63
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:02,443
>> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE

64
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:04,278
THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR

65
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:06,580
CHILDREN, WHICH WE HAVE HAD TO

66
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,449
HAVE.

67
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,252
ON BROADER TERMS, FOR OUR

68
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,720
YOUNGEST.

69
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,522
BUT THEY KNOW, IT'S BRETT AND

70
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:16,657
THAT THEY THE TRUTH.

71
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,692
AND WE TOLD THEM AT THE

72
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,895
BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS, THIS

73
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:22,696
WILL BE NOT FUN SOMETIMES.

74
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,599
PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY AND YOU

75
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,100
NEED TO KNOW THAT.

76
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,036
JUST REMEMBER, YOU KNOW YOUR DA

77
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,706
DAD.

78
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:33,708
>> Tucker: I BET THOSE GIRLS

79
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,143
WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THIS.

80
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,911
>> Martha: HOW COULD THEY BE?

81
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:38,246
YOU CAN IMAGINE AT THEIR AGE,

82
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:41,482
THEY ARE AT AGES TEN AND 12 IN

83
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,718
THAT AGE, I'M SURE IT'S

84
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:44,886
DEVASTATING FOR THEM.

85
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:46,521
I ASKED HIM SPECIFICALLY POINT

86
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,089
BLANK ABOUT ALL OF THE

87
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,123
ALLEGATIONS AND WE TALKED ABOUT

88
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:51,125
THEM IN VERY SPECIFIC, GRAPHIC

89
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:51,492
TERMS.

90
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:53,161
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE

91
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:57,265
TO KIND OF FRAME THAT ISSUE, BUT

92
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:59,267
SHE ALSO SAID, THEY KNOW THEIR

93
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:00,101
DAD.

94
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,102
EVEN IN THE BEGINNING WHEN HE

95
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:02,470
GOT ROUGHED UP IN THAT FIRST

96
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,238
DAY, HE SAID HIS DAUGHTER CAME

97
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:09,010
DOWN AND GAVE THEM A HUG THAT

98
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,078
NIGHT.

99
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,413
AND THE ALLEGATIONS ARE WHAT

100
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:15,383
THEY ARE, HE'S GOING TO FACE

101
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:19,287
THAT ON THURSDAY.

102
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,223
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS HAS

103
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:21,923
BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT

104
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:25,694
FOR THEM.

105
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:27,395
>> Tucker: WHEN CLARENCE

106
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:28,897
THOMAS WAS APPROVED AND OF

107
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:29,798
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR IN 1991,

108
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:31,166
HE MADE A DECISION THAT HE WAS

109
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,201
GOING TO FIGHT BACK IN A VERY

110
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:34,135
TOUGH WAY.

111
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,905
HE WAS NOT GOING TO GO DOWN.

112
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:37,639
DO YOU THINK KAVANAUGH HAS MADE

113
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:44,813
THAT DECISION?

114
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:45,847
>> Martha: KAVANAUGH WAS NOT

115
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:46,581
IN CLARENCE THOMAS FIGHTING

116
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:49,518
SHAPE TODAY.

117
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:50,285
AND WHEN HE BASICALLY LEVELED

118
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:52,087
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

119
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,054
IT'S SO POWERFUL.

120
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,689
THAT'S NOT THE FRAME OF MIND

121
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:55,690
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH APPEARED TO

122
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,225
BE IN TODAY, ALTHOUGH HE MAY BE

123
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:59,494
THAT MOOD ON THURSDAY.

124
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:00,962
HE ASKED HIM SEVERAL TIMES, YOU

125
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:02,964
SAY THIS IS ALL FALSE, SO WHAT

126
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:04,599
DO YOU THINK IS BEHIND THIS?

127
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,268
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS IS

128
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:06,768
COMING FROM?

129
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:09,237
IS THERE SOME KIND OF POLITICAL

130
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,405
VENDETTA AGAINST YOU THAT'S

131
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,506
BEING PLAYED OUT?

132
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:12,440
WE ALL KNOW THE CORNERS THAT

133
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,476
COULD BE COMING FROM BUT HE DID

134
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,344
NOT WANT TO GO THERE AT ALL.

135
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,113
HE DOESN'T WANT TO CONJECTURE

136
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:19,915
ABOUT ANY OF THAT.

137
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:20,714
AND CLARENCE THOMAS CLEARLY

138
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,717
CALLED IT WHAT HE THOUGHT IT

139
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:22,984
WAS.

140
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:26,188
A HIGH-TECH LYNCHING AND HE

141
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:26,855
THOUGHT THE SENATE JUDICIARY

142
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,456
COMMITTEE HAD SUNK TO SUCH LOWS

143
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:30,592
TO ENTERTAIN SOME OF THE

144
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:31,760
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM, THAT

145
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,727
THEY ENTERTAINED.

146
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:35,130
THAT WAS HIS FEELING, AND THEY

147
00:04:35,130 --> 00:00:00,000
PERSEVERED.
