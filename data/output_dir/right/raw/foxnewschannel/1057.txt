1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,428
>> Tucker: BY NOW YOU HAVE

2
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:08,362
HEARD THE CRUSHING NEWS ABOUT

3
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,197
OUR COLLEAGUE AND DEAR FRIEND

4
00:00:10,197 --> 00:00:10,965
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

5
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:13,167
I HAVE ONLY A FEW WEEKS LEFT

6
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,668
TO LIVE, CHARLES WROTE IN ONE

7
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:16,003
OF HIS FINAL LETTERS.

8
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:17,771
THIS IS THE FINAL VERDICT.

9
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:19,006
MY FIGHT IS OVER."

10
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:20,307
OVER THE COMING DAYS CHARLES

11
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,910
WILL BE CELEBRATE AND

12
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,512
ULTIMATELY EULOGIZED BY THOSE

13
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:25,279
WHO KNEW HIM.

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,413
FOR GENERATIONS HE WILL

15
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:27,414
CONTINUE TO TOUCH AND GUIDE

16
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:28,782
THOSE WHO DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

17
00:00:28,782 --> 00:00:31,318
HIS WORDS CLEAR AND CRISP AND

18
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:33,187
TRUE WILL LONG OUTLIVE HIM.

19
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:34,788
A LOT WILL BE SAID ABOUT

20
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:35,523
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

21
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:37,024
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE THING.

22
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:38,626
OVER THE MORE THAN 20 YEARS I

23
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:39,927
KNEW HIM, CHARLES THOUGHT

24
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:40,761
ABOUT DEATH EVERY DAY.

25
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:42,496
HE TOLD ME THAT ONCE.

26
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,967
IF THAT SOUNDS MORE -- MOROSE,

27
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:47,902
IT'S THE OPPOSITE.

28
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,470
HE WAS ONE OF THE RARE PEOPLE

29
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,205
WITH THE COURAGE TO LOOK

30
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,774
REALITY SQUARELY IN THE FACE.

31
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:55,442
CHARLES RADIATED A CALM

32
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:55,876
CHEERFULNESS.

33
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:56,977
HE KNEW WHAT WAS COMING.

34
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:58,078
HE HAD BEEN CLOSE TO IT

35
00:00:58,078 --> 00:00:58,445
BEFORE.

36
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,514
HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE, BUT

37
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:03,284
IT DIDN'T SCARE HIM.

38
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:04,885
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER IS A

39
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:05,619
GENUINELY BRAVE MAN.

40
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:08,255
FOR THAT REASON, HE IS A HAPPY

41
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:08,822
MAN.

42
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,624
"I LIVE THE LIFE THAT I

43
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:11,559
INTENDED," HE WROTE.

44
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:13,494
"THERE IS NO HIGHER

45
00:01:13,494 --> 00:01:14,595
ACHIEVEMENT THAN THAT."

46
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:15,095
GOOD NIGHT.

47
00:01:15,095 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
