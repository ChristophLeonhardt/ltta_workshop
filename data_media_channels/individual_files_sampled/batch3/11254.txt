now the US Army is looking for help to access and respond to foreign social media platforms with a system so sophisticated it can even understand and use slang RT discovered the ad online the software needs to interpret the sentiment within a social media post and distinguish between negative and positive Farsi Russian and Korean are among the languages targeted it must translate from them and back to them and the Pentagon wants replies to retain the original tone the request comes from the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command well let's now discuss this interesting find with our guest former mi5 intelligence officer Animus Sean misma Sean thank you for coming on the program for us what do you think the need would be for such software well obviously the the most obvious interpretation would be that this is a pushback against the allegations that have been made consistently for the last 18 months about so-called Russian troll farms influencing elections across the West and it's interesting to see that the languages that they're advertising for the blue language of Iran and of course North Korea and Russia so that would be a bit of a sort of giveaway about which countries they want to be targeting having said that though the timing to me is interesting because for sure the West has been running these so-called troll farms against the other countries as well for a long time so are they just trying to expand their operations by developing this new software or they trying to disingenuously suggest to people but actually I haven't done it before only the big bad Russians or the big bad Chinese who run troll phones and they're beginning to develop this software so I think there's some interesting questions there I would say as well personally the first time I became aware of the concept of troll farms and astroturfing which is creating fake grassroots movements commenting online was over a decade ago and that was actually coming out of Israel so you know all our countries do this that's the big mystery isn't it whether such software would be a threat or whether it would be for snooping what do you think I think it's one to try and influence people's attitudes certain issues of course so that can potentially be a threat I mean that's what America has been saying about the so-called Russian hacking of the American election last year but yes it can be used for snooping too and interestingly it was only a couple of weeks ago I think that WikiLeaks revealed a program from GCHQ which is the UK government communications headquarters our listening post which was actually doing the same sort of trolling and developing the same sort of software between the years 2009 2010 so Britain certainly has been doing exactly the same thing for almost a decade as well and this request it comes from the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command which collects intelligence for combat operations so how would this new software be useful in that respect well I mean we know that America has this the kill list that is signed off by the American President every Tuesday morning where they can go out and target a so-called terrorist suspects across North Africa across Central Asia across the Middle East and take them out with drone strikes there is no due process there is no rule of law in this it's just what the intelligence agencies assess to be problematic people who might well be involved in terrorist attack attacks in the future and they are assassinated and we've seen this drone program take out whole villages village councils wedding parties right across great swaths of the planet so if they're beginning to use this new algorithmic software in this way that can potentially target people I think people need to become very much even more frightened accross great sway for the planet and you said before you know the US has continually accused Russia of using BOTS and troll factories to influence us on social media isn't this just an attempt to do exactly the same and is it obviously in double standards here of course it's double standards as I said up at the front of this interview one they're probably just expanding a pre-existing program so if GCHQ and the UK has been doing at least 2009 there is no doubt that the NSA in America will have been doing the same sort of thing so they may might just be trying to recruit and expand an existing program or they might be disingenuously trying to indicate that of course they've never done it before but they're having to do it now in response to the so-called Russian troll phones and the Israeli 12 hands or whatever so it's interesting timing and particularly after WikiLeaks revealing what GCHQ has been getting up to mmm very interesting thanks for that that's their animus Shaun from mi5 intelligence officer thanks a lot
