the Food and Drug Administration has authorized a phase three clinical study of the drug that is known as ecstasy or MDMA for the treatment of PTSD ecstasy for people who may not know is a pharmaceutical developed by Merck pharmaceuticals and patented by them in 1912 as a diet aid as an appetite suppressant and it never really got traction in the market but by the 1960s researchers noticed that this was something that helped people to become less inhibited when they took a group called Maps multidisciplinary Association for psychedelic studies which is a real scientific group sponsored two clinical studies the protocol was three sessions so taking MDMA once three times in a controlled environment with a psychiatrist in the second phase of clinical studies what the researchers found was that two-thirds of the people who participated in the study no longer qualified to be described as having PTSD at the end of the study this is very very exciting because especially returning War veterans have almost no viable therapeutic options for recovery the phase three clinical trial of MDMA with people who suffer from PTSD will be done on about 230 people and if this study goes well MDMA could finally have its day as a therapeutic aid for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder so this could be a very significant breakthrough you
