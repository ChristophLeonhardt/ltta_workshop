BAD. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ANNOUNCING THAT BORDER RESTS EXCEEDED 50,000 FOR THE THIRD MONTH IN A ROW. DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA WITH US THE AUTHOR OF THE BEST SELLER AND FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT GERALDO RIVERA. THIS IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY WANT TO RAISE TAX. THEY ARE SAYING DON'T TELL ANYBODY, WE WANT TO IMPEACH THE PLAYER. BUT DON'T SAY IT. MAXINE WATERS STOP. YOU HEARD WHAT NANCY PELOSI SAID ABOUT MS-13 AND THEY WANT TO KEEP OBAMACARE. DON'T YOU THINK THOSE WILL BE BIG ISSUES IN THE NOVEMBER? I THINK THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE IS THE HOT BUTTON ISSUE IN NOVEMBER. THAT WILL BE THE ONE THAT RESONATES AND SEPARATES THE PARTIES. I HAVE A CAUTIONARY NOTE. I AM A REPUBLICAN AND I DON'T WANT A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY. I THINK THEY WILL ENDEAVOR TO IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT, OUR FRIEND WHO IS DOING A TERRIFIC JOB. HERE'S MY CAUTIONARY NOTE. WHEN YOU USE WORDS LIKE ANIMAL YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THESE GANG MEMBERS AND NOT PAINT THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WITH A BROAD BRUSH. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS AND THE RIGHT TO HARD POLICEWORK IN ANY KIND OF EFFORT THAT IS LEGAL. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE MORAL RIGHT TO SEPARATE MIGRATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE THIS ISSUE BY DOING SOMETHING THAT IS SO Sean: OKAY, A WALL WITH A DOOR. YOU ARE OKAY WITH THAT? I AM OKAY WITH THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE WALL ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE DREAMERS GIVEN A PASS, A GREEN LIGHT. Sean: THE PRESIDENT OFFERED THAT AND THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT TAKE THAT. YOU ARE RIGHT. Sean: DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, AM I RIGHT ON THE 4 BIG ISSUES OF 2018? OH, I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. NOTHING HAS REALLY CHANGED EXCEPT THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED ON THESE KEY ISSUES. HE STARTED TO BUILD THE WALL. THE FIGURES FROM THE DHS ARE STUNNING. IT'S THE ECONOMY AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGAIN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE DEMS DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE. THEY ARE WHISPERING IN THE BACKGROUND ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. WHO IS THEIR REAL LEADER? Sean: THEY WANT HIGHER TACKS AND IMPEACH PRERMENT. MORE JOBS FOR MS-13. IT'S A MESSAGE THAT IS INSANITY. IT'S TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. WHEN NANCY PELOSI SAYS NATIONAL JOB FIGURES MEAN LITTLE. THE FIRST TIME EVER WE HAVE FULL EMPLOYMENT. YOU HAVE MORE JOBS AVAILABLE THAN PEOPLE LOOKING FOR JOBS. NANCY PELOSI, DO YOU WANT MORE UNEMPLOYMENT? Sean: SHE WANTS TO TAKE THE CRUMBS BACK. NO THANK YOU. RIGHT. Sean: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE MORE JOBS THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED. FIRST LOW UNEMPLOYMENT FOR HISPANIC AMERICANS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND WOMEN. DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA HITS A GOOD POINT, SEAN. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS DIVIDED SOCIETY IS THAT WE ARE NOT ON THE SAME TEAM. WE CHEER AGAINST OUR PRESIDENT'S SUCCESSES. Sean: THE DEMOCRATS DO. DEMOCRATS ARE CHEERING FOR AMERICA TO FAIL. THEY CAN'T STAND HIS SUCCESS BECAUSE IT HURTS THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN POWER. THAT'S A FACT. WHEN IT COMES TO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE NORTH KOREA NEGOTIATIONS, I WANT EVERYBODY TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM. CHEERING FOR SUCCESS FOR THE PRESIDENT. . LOOK, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT AMERICA TO SUCCEED. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TO SABOTAGE
