for example I don't believe that these trigger warnings and safe spaces and biased reporting lines will serve the causes of anti oppression or anti racism or anti-semitism at ur of fact they merely serve as tools of oppression in their own right that was Michael recktenwald the professor famous for getting put on paid leave at New York University after daring to criticize leftist ideology on Twitter recktenwald anonymously operated the anti PC NYU prof Twitter account tweeting bits of genius like liberalism coops the discourse and techniques of radicalism and turns them into devices of mass manipulation and identity politics has debar from Nietzsche made an infirmary of the whole world as well as some witticism like she's worked like a demon said Bill Clinton regarding Hillary Clinton might not be because she is a demon after confessing himself to be the perpetrator of these heinous crimes recktenwald was allegedly harassed and ostracized by faculty a site stripped three essays of his name committing plagiarism by giving someone else authorship and nyu put the professor on paid leave I have to be very careful here according to NYU there's absolutely no connection between my leave of absence and Mike my opinion hmm I'm sure it had absolutely nothing to do with his critique of the protected class of progressives it's not like NYU's made any other controversial employment decisions like oh I don't know hiring white genocide communists professor George cigarette omar who said the las vegas massacre is what happens when whites don't get what they want but it's a monday and you're probably a need for a happy story so i'm pleased to tell you that things look up for recktenwald the professor is now suing nyu and for colleagues for defamation he alleges that faculty members used official email distribution lists to defame him in May of 2017 calling him a right-wing misogynist in a hole and Satan in messages sent to over 100 NYU faculty and administrators recktenwald claims that his colleagues were concerned about his mental how and coerced him into taking a leave of absence nyu on the other hand says the professor voluntarily chose to take it the thing that is interesting here is that they were saying that because i don't think like them i am sick and mentally ill recktenwald said so you have to be crazy to not believe what they do now it may be true that you have to be crazy to say it because look what happened but the professor makes an important point we live in an era in which one side of the debate demonizes dissent the left doesn't just think you're wrong know if you disagree with PC culture identity politics socialism there's something wrong up here with you or you're just plain evil and take your pick you can either be institutionalized for your wrong thing which is where academia comes in or you can have it beaten out of you by those who see no difference between hate speech and actual violence for campus unmasked I'm Rob shim shocked if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
