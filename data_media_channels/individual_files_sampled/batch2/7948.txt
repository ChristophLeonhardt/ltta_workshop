an investigation into the shooting and the death of an Australian woman by the name of Justine daymond in Minneapolis has essentially turned up some indication as to why a cop opened fire which led to her death investigators probing the death said that the officers were quote startled by a loud sound near their patrol car right before the shooting so for those of you who might have missed this story earlier this week the shooting occurred after Justine Damon had called the cops to report a possible sexual assault near her home in the alleyway near her home when the cops arrived she went to go talk to them and when she did so allegedly they heard some noise that startled them and the cop in the passenger side of the vehicle Muhammad nor decided to open fire and keep in mind that Justine Damon was speaking to the cop on the driver's side so according to reports Nour opened fire and shot through the driver's side door and one shot hit her abdomen and tragically killed her the officer who was driving the patrol car told investigators that right after the loud noise Damon approached the car on his side the officer who was in the passenger seat that fatally shot Damon through the driver's side window here's the thing if you are a cop if you are that easily startled you should maybe reconsider being a cop right if you hear noise and you're first you know idea is to open fire you're not the right person to be a cop now nor is a rookie cop he apparently got hired back in 2015 however there were a number of complaints filed against him in just that short period of time and I'll get to those details in just a second but Brett jump in right there there's a lot of things that you start asking yourself when something like this happens like aren't there body cams details I don't know if you reported on in previous days those body cams hadn't been act vated according to the police chief and different sources within within the department there are protocol that defined when the body cam and then also the dash cam get activated dash cam is more automated like when you flip on your siren that starts being activated but it's the way the protocol is now it's on the police officers to when they feel like they're going to be in danger and need to use force then flip on the body cam on themselves and then go take the action or if it all happens so fast and once it's safe they're supposed to turn it back on these seem like red flags for me this seems like we need to rethink the process behind all of this because I seldom as someone like I get it and the benefit of the doubt I want the candor to be on to vindicate myself because I feel confident whatever whatever motivations I might have and how they might lead to different activities but then again you're just saying like if I want those cameras to be on all the time at all times yes it should be possible to document and that shouldn't change the story of the cop who wants it to be on who wants to flick it on to vindicate themselves but I want to go around the person who might be keeping something secret who wouldn't want something documented and why leave it up to chance why why can't we I know that like hey Siri I can say and if I was in an airplane mode because I'm such a conscientious host it has been listening to me and it would turn off this even said sorry not available there's ways to make it pre-tape and start pre recording and then afterwards activate it and make sure you save the time before so if like battery life and space are an issue those are things that you can overcome but there are a lot of procedural issues that come up in question here is speak especially because I don't know what answers were gonna get because those answers would ostensibly come from some kind of documentation through videotape which we didn't have because it wasn't on what I find interesting is that they are supposed to have if they're on duty they are supposed to have their cameras on and this was a policy that was implemented you know after all these controversial shootings took place in Minneapolis but what I find fascinating is that okay you might make the argument that one cop forgot to turn on his body cam but we're talking about two cops neither one of them had their body cam on and then there was no footage from the dash cam so essentially there's no evidence of what really occurred and so people are understandably frustrated at the lack of transparency the lack of details regarding what happened and an innocent nonviolent loving passionate great person died that night after they made the mistake of calling cops to report a possible sexual assault in the alleyway and that's the I mean look not only did someone lose their life but think about what kind of messaging this sends to people who are already a little you know skeptical about cops like are you gonna trust cops look I mean this is a personal anecdote so you know take it with a grain of salt cuz I don't know if I represent a huge population of people but I remember two years ago there was a homeless woman who very clearly had mental health issues right outside my bedroom window and she was completely naked she was screaming out off the top of her lungs she found like a hose across the street from where we were living and just started like hosing herself off she's completely naked and she's screaming and so I didn't know what to do and I thought about calling the cops and then I realized no I am NOT gonna call the cops I don't know how they're gonna handle this situation and that's that's coming from me and I'm obviously from a place of privilege right I I didn't grow up fearing the cops I didn't worry about retaliation from cops or any type of harassment from them but you hear about stories like this and it makes you wonder or question whether or not you know calling them is the best solution for an issue like that I get I get that reticence and I and I and again there's also things like when the cops come if they're if they're dealing with that kind of a situation day in day correlations that I've seen where if like cops responding to a call like a suicide that on one day the next day they're more likely to have a higher level response disproportionate to what's going on so there's a lot that we then I just feel like we keep hearing and keeps getting said in this situation I reiterate all those things and and I don't want to get into like I definitely hear what you say about like the police officer who how could you be rattled because ostensibly we have situations in place for once you get rattled dashcams on everything going on right how are you that easily startled and a loud noise and the fact that it takes days for this kind of information to come out and now the only information that we have is is coming from within from that police officer luckily the it seems that the Chief of Police is ordering an independent investigation because that's another thing that we hear so often these kinds in situations where there's police have seemed seem to have shot someone who didn't do anything right and and you know just to be clear the officer who opened fire Mohammed Noir is refusing to talk to investigators and investigators can't compel him or force him to speak however Matthew harity who is the other cop that was present during that encounter he was the driver of the patrol car he is speaking to authorities and he's the one who released the statement regarding the startling noise right and so we'll see how this case plays out but people are understandably upset and there needs to be there needs to be a lot done to reform what we're seeing with police departments throughout the country by the way one other quick thing I wanted to mention is Noor has had a history of complaints even though he was hired back in 2015 he's only been a cop for a short period of time he currently has three complaints filed against him with the city's office of police conduct review two of which are still open the other was apparently somehow adjudicated but we don't know the details of those complaints they aren't releasing details about that and we also know that he's facing a lawsuit by a woman says that she was treated poorly by him right if you see a pattern this happens in whatever case it is many times there's patterns of how cops have previous either complaints or situations or questionable encounters in their record and there is a constant Oh we'll just move on or you brought up the thing or maybe sometimes the router because the day before they saw something traumatic all of these things you can take into account and it comes back to the top is this the only profession where the top doesn't have any responsibility you know human beings may get rattled and you have cops that have guns and I have people's lives in their hands if that's the case maybe don't have them work that next day or maybe have them on some other kind of beat the next day maybe it's office job for a while until you calm your ass down whatever the problem may be fix it so won't end up leading to something us that you're now in a cover-up mode about um if you work at a Ralph's grocery store its local California store and every shift 20 dollars is missing and that's a routine in like hey I see a pattern here I think I'm gonna take Jeffrey off of a check stand number five once we figure out why this $20 keeps missing don't figure it out trust me yeah they're losing little $20 of the millions they make but if this guy is a history of being rattled or not able to handle situations they go we'll do a year-long review let them go back out there until we figure something else on that isn't as important as losing a couple other jobs when someone is under an open investigation that hasn't been closed yet they're pulled off duty but right now with the guys off duty because of something like this why did it take this I know that the amine I would have imagined that when you work a job like being a police officer along the way people are going to be upset with you no matter what you know and so there will be erroneous claims made but like have a way of classifying it so that we can not have someone out there when it's when a pattern may or may not be be establishing itself but I am I am at least heartened by this independent investigation that they're bringing because so often it seems like a lot of police officers have said it themselves as well as outside watchdog groups have said so often it's people within the same depart who are investigating people they work with on it on a daily basis whether it's the local law enforcement officials or you know or the or the district attorney and it is nice to hear that the Chief of Police is bringing in someone else to conduct an independent investigation but so often I also hear the investigation happened it seems like six or seven months have passed since this was in the news and we'll try to slip it in on a Friday that nothing is gonna come of this yeah I hope that happened far too often if you like this video you probably like
