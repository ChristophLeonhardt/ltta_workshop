of course you remember the Donald Trump state of the union where he said many outrageous things and of course Democrats did not stand up and applaud many of those things there was a lot of demagoguery targeting image immigrants etc some Democrats stood up from time to time like Senator Joe Manchin and he went on Fox & Friends to brag about it the day after but not a lot of reasons to rejoice if you're a Democrat with Donald Trump's draconian proposals but Trump thinks not applauding the president is unacceptable but of course he's Trump so he's gonna go way way past that listen no is bad energy you're up there you've got half the room going totally crazy wild they loved everything they want to do something great for our country and you have the other side even on positive news really positive news like that they were like death and an American an American somebody said treasonous I mean yeah I guess why not can we call that treason why not I mean they certainly didn't seem to love our country very much why not so we're all the Republicans treasonous when they refused to stand up for Obama's State of the Union mmm that's one reason why not if you're a Republican if they don't do a standing ovation for everything president Bernie Sanders says is that going to be treasonous looking forward to it hey can't wait why not why not this guy doesn't understand the country it's so ironic is in reality he's on American the other side doesn't have to applaud you you're not a dictator you're not a king you're the president if that you have ideas they like like infrastructure they will applaud that if you have ideas where you do demagoguery yes immigrants and compare them to ms-13 and killers and murders they don't have to applaud that that is actually very American that is their freedom of speech that is their right to act out as the representatives of the people who put them into that office who are not big fan of yours but he doesn't get it he's authoritarian by Nature and so he thinks well if they don't stand up and applaud me well then I guess why not treason I guess it's treasonous unamerican Donald Trump you might be the president but you don't represent us and you're not what America is so don't be so arrogant as to think that even the president is America No we all have different opinions and not standing up and applauding you doesn't mean that we don't love America part of the reason they didn't stand up to applaud you is the exact opposite reason because they do love America and they believe in the idea of America and the American dream the dream that you spoke so forcefully against that night but overall you get a sense of the man and you get a sense of his inclination I mean to say that anyone who doesn't applaud you is treasonous would have previously been considered unimaginable and monstrous but we're so used to monstrous with Donal we just take it in stride oh yeah the president says anyone who doesn't applaud him may be committed treason like you could say he's joking around but that is not a proper way to joke around saying the other party is on American and treasonous simply because they didn't applaud you by the way he was partly bragging earlier in the speech about the stock market how's that working out for you Donald you rode Obama's coattails in and this unemployment numbers going down just like they were under Obama we showed you the charts stock markers going up just like they were under Obama but what did you do you got greedy and you dug and you dug and you gave away all that money to your rich donors and we told you that it was overinflated we told you about the bubble and over the last two days that bubble has begun to burst so if there is a trump bump well it's a now bumpy days forum overall and that bump is headed straight down like everything else that Donald Trump has ever touched in his career you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
