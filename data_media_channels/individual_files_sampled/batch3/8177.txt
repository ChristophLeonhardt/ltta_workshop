THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT RUSSIA ATTACKED US. ATTACKS ON OUR CONSTITUTION. ATTACK ON THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. THERE WAS ALREADY AMPLE EVIDENCE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN ON THE ISSUE OF COLLUSION IF YOU ARE WILLING TO SEE IT. Martha: THAT'S IN THE DRUMBEAT FOR THE DEMOCRATS THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT NOW IS THE 2018 MIDTERMS ARE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER PARTY LEADERS SAY THEY WANT TO MOVE ON AND GET TO A NEW MESSAGE FOR THEIR VOTERS. THEY SAY THEY CAN'T GET ANY PRESS ON THE REAL ISSUES BECAUSE REPORTERS ONLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT RUSSIA. HERE NOW MEREDITH KELLY, THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR. GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. IT'S EVERYWHERE. IT'S ALL YOU HEAR ABOUT. FLIP AROUND THE CHANNELS, EVERYTHING IS ALL ABOUT RUSSIA, SO IT MAKES IT TOUGH FOR YOU GUYS TO GET YOUR MESSAGE OUT. FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR RUSSIA IS CERTAINLY A BIG TOPIC IN THIS INVESTIGATION IS ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON, BUT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ACTUALLY TALKING DIRECTLY TO VOTERS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT IMPACT THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. I DO THINK THEY ARE BREAKING THROUGH. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, PROTECTING MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND MORE JOBS AND BETTER WAGES. I DO THINK ON THE DISTRICT SPECIFIC LEVEL THEY ARE HAVING THOSE LOCAL CONVERSATIONS. Martha: DO THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE CARE ABOUT RUSSIA WHEN YOU TALK TO FOLKS WHO ARE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY? DO THEY CARE? IT'S NOT THE FIRST, SECOND OR THIRD THING THAT VOTERS ARE TELLING US IN THE HOUSE BATTLEFIELD IN THESE SWING DISTRICTS. I THINK PEOPLE WANT THIS INVESTIGATION TO GO UNIMPEDED, BUT THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT THOSE POCKETBOOK ISSUES AND THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON. Martha: GENERALLY WHAT WE FIND WHEN WE GO OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WELL. YOU ARE LOOKING AT ARKANSAS, KENTUCKY, A COUPLE OF TEXAS DISTRICTS. WE HAVE A MAP TO PUT UP AT WHERE THESE DISTRICTS ARE. TELL ME WHAT OTHER TRENDS, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR AND HOW DO YOU HOPE TO FLIP THOSE DISTRICTS YOU HOPE TO FLIP THOSE DISTRICT DISTRICTS? TOMORROW NIGHT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE HUGE NUMBER OF VETERANS, PROSECUTORS AND CANDIDATES, WITH RECORDS OF SERVICE THE RUNNING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THE CYCLE. THAT'S CERTAINLY A TREND WHETHER THEY OBSERVE THE COMMUNITY OR OUR COUNTRY OR BOTH. YOU HAVE ALSO SEEN THE STRENGTH OF FEMALE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS PRIMARIES Martha: WE CAN PUT UP THE BOARDS ON THE PEOPLE THAT SHE IS REFERRING TO. GO AHEAD. I THINK THAT LAST WEEK IN PENNSYLVANIA AND IN NEBRASKA WE SAW A NUMBER OF WOMEN DOING WELL, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ENTHUSIASM THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING FROM WOMEN IN TERMS OF VOTING IN THE MIDTERMS. I THINK YOU ARE SEEING CANDIDATES THAT FOR THESE DISTRICTS. ARKANSAS IS DIFFERENT FROM TEXAS, WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN KENTUCKY AND THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL. Martha: SOUTHERN CANDIDATES, IT BOTHERS THEM, THEY FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH ATTENTION FROM THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE PARTY. WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD THE LARGEST BATTLEFIELD IN A DECADE. WE ARE TARGETING MORE THAN 100 DISTRICTS, SO WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO PROVIDE AS MUCH ASSISTANCE TO CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR OFFICE AS POSSIBLE. OF COURSE IT'S A BIG BATTLEFIELD AND CERTAINLY WE ARE GIVING THE BEST SERVICE WE CAN AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME GREAT CANDIDATES. Martha: TELL ME ABOUT THE ARKANSAS WASTE. CLARK TUCKER IS A CANDIDATE THERE, A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL AND HE ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE RACE HE IS RUNNING AGAINST FRENCH HILL. HE GOT INTO THE RACE BECAUSE HE HAD CANCER AND HE SAW HOW FRENCH HILL VOTED TO REPEAL AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED M HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED T HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED V HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED T HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED D HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED H HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED M HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED T HEALTH CARE AND OUTMODED O RUN. I DO EXPECT HIM TO COME THROUGH THE PRIMARY TOMORROW NIGHT IN FIRST PLACE AND THAT WILL BE CENTRAL, HEALTH CARE WILL BE CENTRAL TO THAT GENERAL ELECTION. Martha: SESSIONS IS ONE THAT YOU THINK ON TAXES? THAT THE DALLAS AREA. SECRETARY CLINTON WON THAT DISTRICT AFTER A LONG STRING OF REPUBLICANS WINNING IN THE PAST. COLLIN ALLRED, WHO THE NEW TRIPLE C HAS PUT ON OUR RED TO BLUE PROGRAM, WHICH MEANS WE THINK IT'S THE MOST COMPETITIVE CANDIDATE. HE'S A TENNESSEE TITANS, FORMER NFL PLAYER. WENT ON TO BECOME A SUCCESSFUL LAWYER AND JUST GREW UP IN THIS DISTRICT AND REALLY EMBODIES THE DISTRICT. Martha: HILLARY CLINTON AS WE SAID IT HAD A BIG EVENT. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP WERE JUST LISTENING TO THEIR HUSBANDS AND SHE THINKS WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO ELECT A WOMAN AND YET IN THE NEW YORK RACE SHE'S NOT BACKING CYNTHIA NIXON, SHE'S BACKING ANDREW CUOMO. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I CAN'T SPEAK TO HER DECISION. I JUST KNOW THAT GOVERNOR CUOMO AND SECRETARY CLINTON GO WAY BACK I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THAT. I KNOW THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT EARNING THE TRUST OF EVERY VOTER WHETHER THEY VOTED FOR TRUMP OR SECRETARY CLINTON, AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT, SO WE ARE WORKING AND EARNING THEIR TRUST. Martha: IT'S GOING TO BE
