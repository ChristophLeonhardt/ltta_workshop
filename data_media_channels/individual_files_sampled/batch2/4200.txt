intelligence the National Ski reporter Kendall a nyan you were in that courtroom today when you heard the judge do this this was a motion by manna forts attorney to essentially get the charges against him some of these charges not all of them dismissed because they're arguing it's outside the scope of the special counsels investigation what happened in that courtroom it was supposed to be a routine run-of-the-mill hearing Chuck and the judge ts Ellis a Republican appointed judge just teed off on not only the Moller team the entire premise of the Moller investigation Wow now I might take on it he was engaging in a bit of rhetoric he was trying to be provocative it's it's not uncommon for federal judges to slap the government around and then rule in the governments favor and a lot of legal observers are still expecting that to happen here but he'll still give the special counsel this leeway to charge him with extra crimes yeah because the the hurdle to dismiss these charges is pretty high but some of the things he said you don't really care about mr. manna for its bank fraud this judge said you really care about getting information mr. manna for can give you that would reflect on mr. Trump and lead to his prosecution or impeachment by the way I would I would characterize that in Washington as a michael kinsley gaff meaning accidentally telling the truth about what the investigation is really about exactly he's basically saying the Muller we know you're squeezing Manta Ford squeeze them legitimately don't go over don't go overboard I know what he's trying to and of course we've been reporting that he's squeezing metaphor this is not a secret but he already squeezed Rick Gates exuse metaphors partner so it's obvious where he's going but the Moller team was not willing to admit that in court today was very interesting and they just continued to argue look this is legitimate inquiry yes these charges don't relate to Russia collusion but they stem from our inquiry into Russia collusion we were following the money I assume Manta Ford's biggest hurdle here is that there's still evidence he committed a crime and even if it's outside the scope you can't you can't somehow hide from being charged from a crime right yeah there's a suggestion that maybe this should have been prosecuted by the Eastern District in Virginia the way the Southern District in New York is going after Michael Cohen but at the end of the day the the regs are pretty clear that the special counsel can investigate matters arising from the Russian collusion investigation that's what they argue this is all right but the most important thing that happened is that the judge said this on the record because guess who reiterated it and his rally today at the NRA he did that it may not matter what the ruling is the president got what he wants a sports fan the judge also invoked the ESPN come on man segment to dismiss one of the arguments that supposed to cut it was making I thought you'd like that hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more beat the press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
