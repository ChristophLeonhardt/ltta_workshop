it's 5:00 6:00 in the morning I am in
Dubai here in the Middle East looks like
there's some sort of sandstorm it
happening outside they leave this hotel
early now but I'm flying out of this
lovely city at 10 a.m. this morning so
now I gotta pack up and get out of this
hotel room
watch how quick this camera pops up
that's a lot it is out here
excellent session here it allows
wakeboards two minutes
Dubai just want you to know what a
lovely 24 hours it has been of a Ford
returning again sometime soon I don't
have a window seat freak out if I have a
window seat and trying to your window
seat you just gotta believe thing
is this serious amenities tick this leg
of the Trevis is like much longer than
the last ones 13 or 14 hours so finest
need focus and not horse around like I
did from New York to divide so totally
gentle eyes deceive I have lunch and
then I have some work but mostly I'm
gonna focus on sleep
look at that lunch sucks these flights
on the airplane
a real excuse to sit down and get
this leg of the flight also is not as
much of a party atmosphere as the
previous flight where I just like I
couldn't vote this this party time I'm
having a little brownie I could eat
these snacks for days have you ever been
on one of these places with the bar
a couple times because this is you know
I had to fly New York to divide then you
buy this is my second way
and on the last leg it was just
do you like working the bar interesting
people like you say sometimes in the pot
it's just like the fun spot where to
remember to the plate seven hours of the
flight I spent most of that
sleeeeep
really burned myself out yesterday
sure
it's like 5:30 in the morning local time
in Sydney the landing now-ish honestly I
was glad Li take two or three more hours
in this plane right now but I'm also
psyched to finally be landing in
Australia you know for all the traveling
I've done in my life never step foot I'm
incontinent
we are
gonna miss his plane Baldy back on it in
two days back includes 40 38 hours of
travel bye bye thank you bye bye
thank you Chris in the security guards
there made me delete all the footage of
me coming off the plane which is like
why is nothing interesting it was just
so embarrassing because as I go through
the first he's like Mike what are you
gonna do with all this footage and it's
like footage of the carousel you think
of bag it's like really embarrassing to
confront just how an interesting the raw
footage for this video well welcome to
Sydney it's good to be here
is this our car because I only drive
electric what model Tesla is this
very careful with this bag in it is my
electric skateboard do you want to ride
it yeah let me know all right
this hotel is Swank please have a good
team please have a good view please have
it give you that is a good view Wow look
at that view every time lapse that you
will see for the next couple of days
will be shot out of these windows wait
no don't touch the camera hi her
favorite thing to do is hang up on me I
just showered and change my clothes for
the first time in three days that felt
great I want to explain what I'm doing
here in Australia but first I have to
explain something else I walk into this
hotel room and I was like oh great they
brought my bags up and then I realized
those aren't my bags my bags are over
here over here over those are my bags
these appear to be presents there's one
thing I enjoy in life it's presents and
I'm thinking that these probably have
something to do with why I'm here so
maybe this will provide a nice segue
into the next part of the vlog how this
is the biggest present gotten in a long
time
I hope it's filled up $100 bills oh hey
Casey welcome to Sydney and a huge
congratulations on passing 1 billion
views thank you very much
I realized this long flight so that you
know where we're gonna be on a few days
Chris and the team a lovely letter one
ticket to a chartered seaplane hint hint
what am i doing in Sydney a new notebook
from a new red jacket a little pouch
with very very thoughtful another red
couch with some a new skateboard which
is extremely thoughtful because who
would possibly travel to the other side
of the planet and bring their own
skateboard I did actually bring my own
skateboard to the other side of the
planet but it's still thoughtful whoa
not Wow massive amounts of candy these
are never ever gonna fit me but think a
little backpack for Francine thanks but
no thanks
oh and finally what's in this bag hey
man where you from I'm from New York I'm
from Australia if you didn't figure it
out from the hints I'm here in Australia

event here they asked me to speak at it
I said you can count on me YouTube and
yeah Here I am the event is tomorrow
Thursday so I'm spending the rest of
today in rehearsals and things like that
yeah I'm super excited about it's a lot
of people I don't really know how to
structure these episodes for that I went
through so many time zones that today is
tomorrow but this morning was actually
yesterday so this isn't like a full day
but it has been 24 hours confusing I
know I'm just gonna go ahead and end it
right
