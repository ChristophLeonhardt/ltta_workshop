it took just 20 horrific minutes for a van speeding along a sidewalk to hit injure and kill many pedestrians in a crowded part of Toronto during a brief appearance in court 25-year old Alec Minassian was charged with 10 counts of first degree murder 13 of attempted murder without speculating about motive police say they've seized a cell phone and are looking into social media posts that appear to warn about a pending attack as has been reported in the media the accused is alleged to have posted a cryptic message on Facebook minutes before he began driving the rented van and he drove it southbound on Yonge Street and onto the crowded sidewalks media reports say this post now taken down by Facebook referred to an online group called in cell or involuntary celibacy where members revile women who they say refused to have relationships with them the post also praises someone with similar views who killed six in California in 2014 probably security services in Canada and elsewhere will be subcontracting people to go out and do some research on a movement like the insel movement to see if this is a one-off or if we're dealing with a rising crescendo of individuals sounding this call to rebellion against society for this issue for now police have cordoned off several city blocks to gather evidence they say more charges are likely nearby a park that's become a memorial to victims and their families political leaders say the public should feel safe because this attack looks increasingly like the work of a single person was indicated last night by our public security minister at this time we have no reason to suspect that there is any national security element to this attack but obviously the investigations continue just a day ago this busy shopping district was full of people enjoying the spring sunshine then it became a killing ground and now it's the country's largest crime scene as investigators struggle to answer the burning questions Canadians still have first among those why did this happen Daniel a quelle Jazeera Toronto
