the Justice Department is now suing the state of North Carolina over the state law that would bar men who think they're women from using bathrooms meant for women who think they're women and a right because they're you know women attorney general blandly Sinister told reporters quote if the state of North Carolina can tell a man he's not a woman and pretty soon dogs won't be cats cars won't be trees and beef won't be celery and that's just not a world I want to live in if we can't make transgenderism the civil rights issue of this decade then we're going to have to figure out how to fix the economy and fight terrorism and let's face it there's not much chance of that unquote transgender activists burly kumal esto told reporters quote even though I still have a man's sexual equipment I dream of having just the sort of soft full magnificent breasts that I would love to put my hands on if I were a man which I'm not believe me but if I were I'd never be able to get enough of me 1960s civil rights activist Reverend Ashton P racecard issued a statement saying quote this reminds me of the 1960s when brave black men who endured segregation faced violent resistance in order to win the right to identify as black women who endured segregation I was so impressed with their courage that I've been identifying as black ever since and it's been a terrific living for me I don't mind saying I mean you should see my car do you think a white man would be able to afford a car like that I don't think so unquote presumptive Democratic nominee for corrupt president Hillary Clinton said she would also join the fight to make sure sexually deviant men could use women's bathrooms and locker rooms mrs. Clinton told reporters quote I will not rest until every single little girl in the state of North Carolina has been molested by some crazy dirtbag mrs. Clinton who is herself a harpy who identifies as a human being says she fears that could soon be state laws that would prevent her from sweeping down out of the night sky and tearing men's souls out with their her teeth presumptive Republican nominee for absolutely disgraceful president Donald Trump also came out against the North Carolina bill he said quote this bill would prevent creepy men from sneaking up on younger women in areas where those women cannot easily call for help which let's face it is my entire game at this point we here at the Daily wire feel the Justice Department suit raises many very serious questions for instance what the hell is going on around here and winds winds the next back to reality let's put it this way if you're waiting for that reality we're descending back to madness folks and you can hear it right here and you can see it here you could watch us descend into madness if you would only subscribe and send us your questions tomorrow we hope to have our first mailbag we will have them now but yeah we'll have a mailbag you can only send in questions if you subscribe so subscribe and send in questions now today I got a lot of tweets and emails over yesterday's show saying oh you're descending into you know Trump derangement syndrome and you used to be you used to be sensible but now you're just bashing on Trump today toward the end of this program I'm going to lay out for you exactly in absolute detail just seriously in specific detail why I feel the way I feel about Donald Trump you know I think I called him something like a clownish reptile exact tell why I would say that because I don't just want to throw names out there is something on my mind about Donald Trump and I'm gonna be very specific about exactly what it is but first let's take a closer look at this thing in North Carolina now there's this bill I think it's called hb2 or something they're just calling it the bathroom law and what it says it was a bill to counteract a Charlotte North Carolina bill that demanded that transgender people be allowed into bathrooms and all this bill says is no businesses don't have to do that and if you are a government facility you do have to borrow transgenders men should use men's rooms women should use men's rooms so in the monologue that I almost got through I called Loretta Lynch blandly sinister and she is one of the most sinister public officials in she everything she says comes out in this kind of schoolmarm ish like she's explaining math to you you know like she's explaining just ordinary the most basic thing and she's the most politicized dishonest creepy Attorney General we have ever had I mean does anybody think just for instance that if the FBI comes back with all this information about Hillary Clinton and says there ought to be an indictment is anyone in on earth think that Loretta Lynch is going to act without reference to political pressures I mean she is just a complete political animal and yet she talks to us like we're in first grade and she's just explaining the moral law to us and it really is offensive so let's listen to how she puts forward this this lawsuit against North Carolina action is about a great deal more than bathrooms this is about the dignity and the respect that we Accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we as a people and as a country have enacted to protect them indeed to protect all of us and it's about the founding ideals that have led this country haltingly but inexorably in the direction of fairness inclusion and equality for all Americans this is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation we saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation we saw it in the fierce and widespread resistance to brown v board of education and we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions that were intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day be afforded the right to marry and that right of course is now recognized as a guarantee embedded in our Constitution oh yeah the founders wrote it right in there right between bill of rights right under the free speech and the freedom of religion it was like gay people get married you know I don't know if I'm if I'm a black guy she's telling you know it's like yes black people you're exactly the same as trannies you know your fight for freedom it's exactly the same as a guy trying to get into a girl's even gay people you know I talked to gay people all the time and they say to me you know it's not really the same thing you know I mean it's like a gay person a gay person is I believe probably born a gay person and has these desires and maybe on that listen I'm not hating on transgender people maybe they're born that way too but it's still it's still looking in dangers the majority I'm eating the government not on the people themselves I mean the people themself really you know some of us have problems that make it uncomfortable for us to live among other people if the government can't always fix that you know the majority has rights too so you know just just to give you an example of something that really bugged me to dozens there's a story today in the Wall Street Journal about the fact that Isis is now putting out kill lists of ordinary Americans they're just picking names off the Internet's people who sound like they might be important to them because maybe they wrote a newspaper article or they're married to somebody who ran for office or something like this could be you could be me it could be anybody so they're just putting out lists of people saying if you like if you like Isis kill this guy you know kill his mom kill his dad kill this kid you know whatever they're just putting out lists of people so these investigators for the FBI and the NYPD these law officers have to go out and they get a list of like 2,000 people and they spend hours and hours and hours calling them up and warning them that they've been put on this kill list and they're there wondering if they should be spending their time like this so here's the Wall Street Journal just a little bit of this story dozens of investigators spent a week individually notifying the people on the list among veteran counterterrorism officials there is disagreement about how seriously the US government should respond to such lists officials said within the NYPD many officials believe the list didn't call for notifications of individuals because there was no credible threat to their safety while at the FBI a number of officials argued that they should be notified out of an abundance of caution the official said because nobody has been killed yet on these lists but they list common and one federal counterterrorism officials said how would you justify not notifying 2,000 people if just one of those 2,000 ended up being hurt or killed so here's a guy who works for the federal government maybe a girl who works for the federal government will call him a guy just for ease gets up puts on his shoes Pat's his dog on the head maybe kisses his wife goodbye and goes in and worries about each one of these people spending hours of his time just so you don't think that everybody in the federal government is wasting our money and our time suing sovereign states to tell them who should use their bathrooms you know I mean that's not the way the government is that there are people in our government still who are serving us and doing this and that's why this blandly sinister attorney general that we have is so offensive to everything the government should be doing everything they should be spending money on so that's the only reason I know there's a little bit of a tangent but that's the only reason I bring it up because there are people in our federal government who we love who are doing great things you know and doing exactly what a federal government should be doing which is keeping us safe from other people not from ourselves and not from our state's okay so this goes beyond just the lawsuit because of course there are all these businesses first of all the federal government can deprive North Carolina of billions of dollars transportation money University money they're studying you know how can we strip them of money to punish them for this evil deed that they have done of making men's rooms men's rooms and on top of that there are all these businesses who are virtue posing by saying well we're not gonna move our business and we're not gonna give you this job and all this so here is Chris Wallace talking to the governor of North Carolina Pat McCrory about how he's going to withstand this onslaught but let's let's take a look at the fallout from this law PayPal canceled a 400 job Operations Center this is since the law was passed and you signed it in March torture banks shelve plans for facilities that would have employed 250 people one study found the law has cost North Carolina 77 million dollars and 1,750 jobs governor you say you're not gonna risk money this is all this has happened just since March well let me first say North Carolina's had the greatest economic recovery in the United States of America more than any other state this isn't good but since I've been governor let me finish the sentence Chris and then second I need to say PayPal for example is kind of selective hypocrisy and selective outrage this is the same paypal company that did business Sudan did business in Iran does business in Saudi Arabia and they're lecturing North Carolina because the majority of North Carolinians I believe think a man who's a man ought to use the restroom that is on the door and the same thing applies to women that and if this is especially true in our schools in our junior High's that our high schools this is a basic change of norms that we've used for decades throughout the United States of America and the Obama administration is now trying to change that norm again not just in North Carolina but there ordering this to every company in the United States of America starting tomorrow I assume or Tuesday and also making this an order for every university in the United States of America see that the state is suing back so that's the interesting point the the argument of the federal government is that this is a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which says you can't violate you can't discriminate on the basis of sex okay and what North Carolina is saying that is by sex we mean sex I mean men are men and women are women and they are accusing the federal government of overreach by rewriting essentially rewriting the law out of the Justice Department what McCrory said is if if the federal government wants to pass a law redefining sex redefining genders whatever you think you are and thereby opening our bathrooms to anybody in our locker rooms and our girls locker rooms to anybody who wants to go in let him do it but they haven't done it and the law really just says there's no discrimination on the basis of sex and and by the way if it's not discriminating on the basis of sex to have a woman's room for women and a men's room for men I don't see why it's discriminating on the basis of sex to make men use the room for men and women use the room for women I think this Justice Department is are bullies I think that she Loretta Lynch is a fake I think they have done everything they can to overtake local law enforcement with federal law enforcement with disastrous results for localities with high crime and I think this is a complete distraction from the failures of this administration to handle our economy and to handle the threat of terrorism and the governor is absolutely right while they are lecturing us on how nice we should be to Muslim nations that treat women like absolute chattel they should be leaving the sovereign state of North Carolina to decide on its own who uses its bathrooms it's absolutely absurd and it's you know the old it's even it's even just a distraction you know it's obviously just a distraction because it's what does it how many people are there like this in America who are worried about this eight you know so anyway all right so back to the Trump Wars as we'll call in the Civil War captain Captain America first civil war you know as I said yesterday I was very hard on Trump and I was kind of dismissive of him you know and I've been using I was name-calling and all this stuff and so people were yelling at me and they were saying you know why are you being like this when Hillary is so much worse and all this and I've been detailing some of the ways that people are thinking about this and I myself have still not decided how I'm going to use my my one little vote that I have and how I'm going to what I'm gonna stand for exactly but I do know how I feel about it and I want to point out that the reason there's a lot of guys if you'll notice that a lot of certain people of a certain age a lot of guys of a certain age a certain intellectual bent guys like Charles Krauthammer Victor Davis Hanson me are saying basically you know we're taking our time making up our mind and there's a reason for that it's like after you reach a certain age you suddenly suddenly dawns on you that moral certainty and morality are not the same thing in fact sometimes there is the exact opposite so there's time to decide there's time to look at things from all angles it is a moral dilemma you know a moral dilemma you don't decide on't get rid of a moral dilemma by just declaring that it's not a dilemma it actually is a painful moral dilemma it's painful to contemplate not just Obama successor and Hillary Clinton but Obama's even more corrupt successor in Hillary Clinton taking over the office of the presidency and Trump is a problem and I'm going to detail exactly why here's let me give you a couple of people now weighing in here's Victor Davis Hanson a brilliant classicist he says there are six long months to go in what has already become a reckless grueling and unpredictable campaign between 250 candidates by the time of the election Hillary Clinton will be 69 she has health problems and she is mired in a host of scandals from the shakedowns of the Clinton Foundation to a possible federal reprimand or indictment over her reckless use of her private email server for State Department business Donald Trump is a year older with a trail of business controversies and he is capable of saying anything at any time so obviously Victor is hoping one of these cool who just died they're sick but what's keeping them why are they still here all right he goes on to say amid that dilemma my suggestion says bdh is to curb the hysteria about never Trump while watching him closely over the rest of the spring and early summer in the context of assessing not whether he is a humane and principled conservative because he obviously isn't but whether he is as alleged by some conservatives really less conservative and less humane than Hillary Clinton the Reagan horse left the 2016 conservative barn many months ago and it is coming to be time to pause and assess whether we are really left with only two bad choices or with a bad Trump and a far far worse Clinton if it is the latter than it is an easy choice in November so he's making the same argument he's he's holding fire he's not deciding but he's making basically the argument that Bobby Jindal made yesterday where he said you know Trump is bad he's awful but he'll we know how bad Hillary Clinton is we know how left-wing Hillary Clinton is now Bret Stevens who is the Foreign Affairs columnist for The Wall Street Journal and he's a very bright guy he lost a lot of credit and Cruz together he went after the two of them he did that thing I think his upper class New York's and civilities basically were offended by Cruz and I don't think that was fair I don't think you take a constitutional lawyer who's argued before the Supreme Court and compared them to a guy like Donald Trump he says he says that Hillary Clinton is the hope for conservatives if he says the best hope for what's left of a serious conservative movement in America is the election in November of a Democratic president held in check by a Republican Congress conservatives can survive liberal administration's especially those whose predictable failures lead to healthy restorations think Carter then Reagan Carter was so bad then Reagan came along what isn't survivable is a Republican president who is part no nothing part smoot-hawley and part john birch the stain of a trump administration would cripple the conservative cause for a generation for conservatives a democratic victory in November means the loss of another election with all the policy reversals that entails that maybe dispiriting but elections will come again a trump presidency means losing the Republican Party conservatives need to accept that most that most conservative of wisdoms sometimes losing is winning especially when it offers an education in the importance of political hygiene so he's making basically the argument that Ben is making I think you know that this is just a stain on the conservative party he's not a and and Ben is also very concerned about his policies he feels that that Trump is just a leftist and just as much of a leftist essentially as Hillary Clinton by the way when one argument that I really don't like is when people tell me that what's going to happen is in four years the country will fall apart and then they'll turn to us to fix it because after about 48 hours human beings are confusing and complex enough that they become impossible to predict so when you when somebody tells you what's gonna happen in four years whether he's a climate scientist or a political observer you know just keep your hand on your wallet because we just don't know these things are really really confusing and really difficult all right one more just one more guy PJ O'Rourke another straight down the line conservative guy very funny humorous but obviously a conservative mainstay he says I am endorsing Hillary and all her lies and all her empty promises it's the second worst thing that can happen to this country but she's way behind the second play in second place she's wrong about absolutely everything but she's wrong within normal parameters all right now this is what I want to address okay what are these normal parameters why I mean look you can't look at these guys PJ O'Rourke and you can't say oh he's not a conservative you know suddenly you know it was like people saying Ted Cruz was the establishment suddenly all the definitions change in order to accommodate Trump so why are people like me saying you know this is a real problem and while I still haven't decided this this is why I have a problem I'm going to give you five examples of things that Donald Trump has done and said that make him anomalous and then I'm gonna tell you why they make him different they make him different from every other candidate not only who is running for president but who has run for president in my lifetime and you know I don't want you to think that I'm just like I don't like the way he talks or I don't like his hair or anything like that or you know he's lower-class or anything like that I've no problems with any of those things I just I have a very specific problem with Donald Trump and it's not so much his policies because if if I add it up I would say probably Donald Trump is slightly to the right of Hillary Clinton I'm sympathetic with the idea that he might just might there's a 10% let's call it a 25% chance that he might nominate a better Supreme Court judge than Hillary Clinton would I think that's important and he you know he certainly won't nominate a worse Supreme Court judge than that Hillary Clinton would so that's it that's an argument why doesn't that argument convince me why am I not convinced okay five things he's done one he called for violence against protesters you remember he said that beat the cry you see a heckler in the crowd with a tomato beat the crap out of him and I'll pay for the legal fees even when a guy actually sucker-punched a guy and knocked him off his feet as he was being escorted out he was no longer causing trouble he was being taken out and he was mouthing off and this guy stood up and belted and Trump did not condemn him he said you know maybe I will pay for his legal fees I'm gonna look into this as usual trumpian evasion this this is it's completely unacceptable in a man who wants to be President of the United States you may think you may tell yourself well like I deserved it or this guy deserved it but once you gin up an angry crowd to violence it is out of control and you may just be next you do not know when that crowd is gonna turn on you or your wife or your kid because you looked wrong because you didn't cheer loud enough because you didn't clap hard enough you know in the in the Soviet Union people used to clap until their hands were raw because they were afraid to be the first one to sit down once you are ruled by a mob that mob is in charge and when you sit and tell a mob and a group of angry Trump voters go out and beat that guy up you have transgressed against one of the most basic premises of democracy okay that's one two he did when he was asked about rejecting David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan now he dialed that back but I don't care as Ben said to me the other day he said you got to get that question right a hundred percent of the time that's not a 99 cent question absolutely true absolutely true listen no one no one has come down on black bigotry more than me black lives matter I have spoken out against them all these people who think that blacks should be given affirmative action should be speeded it's treated in a special way I have gone after them I've made fun of them I've attacked them I feel exactly the same way about the white bigots and a white supremacist it is I'm sorry but it is an offense against the God who created us I'm just gonna get right down to it you know if you if we are made in God's image to God didn't make white people in His image he didn't make black people in his image it's all of us we're all here together that is a deep deep offense and you have to know that you don't have to think about that you don't you don't wink at those people you have to know when you come in and somebody says do you condemn the Ku Klux Klan let me give you an advice a hundred percent of the time the answer is yes every single time you don't wink at it you don't have to dial it back you don't have to say it twice it's wrong it's wrong and it's it's against American values too it says Iger pluribus unum own every penny you spend you know I mean that just means out of the many we are one and there's a reason for that it's based in our judeo-christian ethos he violated that ethos that is not something that a candidate for president is allowed to do in this era at this time number three and been showed me this one - this one went completely by me I did not see this a journalist whose name I can't pronounce it's Julia like Hoffy or something like that she wrote an insulting article about Trump's wife Melania for GQ she was then besieged by anti-semitic death threats from Trump's followers Wolf Blitzer had Trump on and asked him how what he wanted to say to these followers of his these fans of his who were sending anti-semitic death threats to a journalist here's the clip of Trump answering that question I haven't read it but I heard the article was not what it should be they shouldn't be doing that with wives I mean they shouldn't be doing that Melania is a top model they sent pictures around to Utah and it wasn't even you know it was you followed these anti-semite about that I don't know anything about these hands of mine suppose it fans yours a posting these angry you'll have to talk to them again message to these fans is I don't have a message to the fans a woman wrote a a article that was inaccurate now I'm used to it I get such bad articles I get such the press is so dishonest well if I can't even tell you it's so dishonest there is nothing more dishonest than the media now I'm sorry but the right answer to that question is how do you feel about your fans it's sending anti-semitic death threats to a journalist the right answer is simply hey nobody should be doing that in my name you don't even have to engage you don't have to engage you don't have to let the guy if you feel he's distracting if you feel the journalist is distracting you from the real issues by tearing you with the actions of your supporters which is not fair say so you can say hey it's not fair to Tommy with those guys I reject them entirely I reject what they're doing the time he doesn't even say that it's okay he has no message for them I mean Blitzer gave him you know two maybe three choices to just say no okay that's not me that's not what I represent and and I don't think Trump is an anti-semite but I do think I do think he winks at the violence and the hatred of his followers he winks at it cuz he doesn't want to alienate them he feels like he needs every one of those dirtbags those worms who crawl out from under rocks he wants every one of them and he's not he's going to appease them and I think that that again that again is a transgression against everything everything the Americans on both sides right and left in different ways we all hold dear that is those are our values okay number four that's three number four you just heard him say leave the families alone the family should be left alone he goes after Ted Cruz's father for some bizarre absurd idea that he helped kill John F Kennedy I mean he went after Cruz's wife he argued that Cruz started that you know even if that was untrue but but still he went after people's families he went after their personal you know attributes and all this stuff that means two things one it means he's a bully it means he's a schoolyard bully that's beneath should be beneath our president my president should be above that I'm sorry that is something our president should be above you don't even see I mean even even Obama who is offensive to the people who oppose him it's not a bully like that he's not a you know he's he's he's mean he's mean-spirited and he's small-minded and he thinks and he's supercilious and arrogant he still doesn't stoop to that level but it also means it also means that Trump is not holding himself to his own values if he thinks that the family should be left alone why isn't he leaving families alone Cruz did hold himself to those values and he acted according to his values Trump simply doesn't he does not think he is governed by the same values as everybody else five that's for number five his kind words for dictators for Putin who he says strong leader I mean Putin is a thug he's a gangster come on Putin killed people Putin has people assassinated people who disagree with him assassinated his strong leader is stronger than our leaders the way that the Chinese murdered their own dissenters in Tiananmen Square you know they didn't have to pay the legal fees there were no legal fees they just blew him away you know they just piled up their bodies in their own blood because they were trying to get a little bit of democracy in China that said Trump they handled it in a strong way okay that is the kind of the romance of strength that this country was built against it's the entire thing that we're here to fighting for it's the entire thing that we're here fighting for and you know what this goes for the left to the left too you know they tend the left who tends more than conservatives to follow people to follow people instead of principles even they even they stand you know back off from a certain kind of romance of the strong man okay there's five examples those are not questions of policy and they're not questions of character those are not questions of like whether he cheated on his wife we know he cheated on his wife he brags about cheating on his wife that's a question of character they're not questions of policy he's gonna tax this one he's not gonna tax it the minimum wage not minimum wage these are questions of morality okay this is these are questions of the web of right and wrong that binds our hearts together and binds our hearts to God it is the very very center of what we are doing as human beings and he violates it and you can say to me that Hillary Clinton is corrupt but it's not the same thing Hillary Clinton is corrupt in the way the Democrat machine politicians have been corrupt for ever we will live through Hillary Clinton's corruption god help us but we will live through it but this what I'm talking about those are five examples of genuine evil and so when I call him names when I have a problem thinking about voting for him when I have a problem thinking about voting for him even if he would name a better Supreme Court justice that's why because you can survive a little corruption in government if you couldn't there would be no democracies corruption is the you know is the disease of democracies we can survive that but no one can survive no one ever can survive evil I mean evil really does a number on governments on societies it makes itself plausible it makes itself acceptable that's the problem with Donald Trump and that is why I have not said that I'll vote for him and why it's going to be very very hard for me to get to that place if I ever do which I sort of doubt all right I think I've explained myself enough right stuff I like we're doing best-selling books that are actually good which is really not that common you know I mean I read a lot of stuff I read it go through the bestsellers and almost most of it you know it's popular trash like TV shows like a lot of the popular TV shows just aren't that good they're just bad you know there are waste of your time all this but a cup every now and again books come along then get really are really successful and they're good and sometimes like this one they're good for reasons that I don't think a lot of the audience was really buying them for this is this book gone girl by Gillian Flynn which big movie big book and the movie was pretty good too I thought with Ben Affleck gone girl is one of these you know twisty turny girl mysteries just like the one I was talking about in fact the one I was talking about yesterday girl on a train was coming out after gone girl trying to play on the popularity with that Gillian Flynn is not that good a mystery writer I've read all of her books now and she isn't oh she's got some good premises okay what she really is and what people don't realize about her is she's a satirist and gone girl is a satire on modern marriage it's a satire on the ideas of romance that have been replaced with the reality of narcissism and it's when you read it that it's a very entertaining little suspense story although it doesn't entirely hold together a lot of people felt that the end kind of trails off it probably does however as a satire or modern marriage it's really funny and it's really sharp and it's really insightful it's a good writer Gillian Flynn I suspect you know I don't I don't mean this is a curse on her I suspect that as people discover what she's really doing she may not be as popular it was with gone girl but gone girl just caught the imagination and it's it's every bit as good as its sales would suggest all right if there is anybody still listening I'll be back tomorrow if alienated everybody today I'm certainly trying my best I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show come back his Radio Free America
