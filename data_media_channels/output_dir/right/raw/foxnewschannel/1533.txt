1
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:11,643
>> FOR DECADES, AMERICAN

2
00:00:11,643 --> 00:00:12,377
TAXPAYERS HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY

3
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:15,179
FORCED TO SUBSIDIZE THE ABORTION

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,981
INDUSTRY THROUGH TITLE X FEDERAL

5
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,050
FUNDING.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,019
SO TODAY WE HAVE KEPT ANOTHER

7
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:21,352
PROMISE.

8
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:24,789
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED A

9
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,158
NEW RULE TO PROHIBIT TITLE X

10
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:29,561
FUNDING FROM GOING TO ANY CLINIC

11
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,798
THAT PERFORMS ABORTIONS.

12
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:34,966
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE ARE

13
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,301
DOING EVERYTHING WITHIN THEIR

14
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,903
POWER TO BLOCK IT.

15
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:41,472
ON THIS ISSUE, LIKE SO MANY

16
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,173
OTHER ISSUES, THE DEMOCRATIC

17
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:44,542
PARTY IS FAR OUTSIDE THE

18
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:47,111
AMERICAN MAINSTREAM.

19
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:48,246
>> Laura: THAT WAS

20
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:49,113

FOR LIFE GALA.

24
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:55,720
A PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,921
STRATEGY IS TO RALLY THE BASE AS

26
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,057
WE HEAD INTO THE MIDTERM

27
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:00,224
ELECTIONS AND HIS FOCUS ON

28
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:01,125
PRO-LIFE INITIATIVES THERE.

LIST.

35
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,505
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON.

36
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,407
BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT

37
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:16,808
PRAISED YOU.

38
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:19,243
WE WERE WATCHING IN THE BACK AND

39
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:19,811
THIS WAS A FUN MOMENT.

40
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:22,380
LET'S WATCH.

41
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,916
>> SHE IS SOME FIGHTER.

42
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,218
SHE WILL DO THE SHOWS THAT

43
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:29,454
NOBODY ELSE DARES GO NEAR.

44
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:32,557
I WILL SAY TO THIS ONE OR THAT

45
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:32,824
ONE.

46
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,759
NO PROBLEM, SIR.

47
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,861
>> Laura: I SAID TO WOMEN,

48
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:37,562
WAIT A MINUTE, KELLY IS COMING

49
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:39,230
ON OUR SHOW.

50
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,132
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT HE MEANS.

51
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:44,302
>> Laura: WE WERE WATCHING,

52
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:45,303
HE'S THE MOST I THINK PRO-LIFE

53
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:48,706
PRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD AND

54
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:49,907
DEFENDING LIFE, THE MOST

55
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:52,010
INNOCENT AMONG US WHO HAVE NO

56
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,479
LOBBYISTS AND NO FAT CATS BEHIND

57
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,280
THEM AND IT'S NOT HIS CROWD,

58
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,248
IT'S A MANHATTAN CROWD.

59
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,384
I'M SORRY, BUT I WAS SO MOVED BY

60
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:00,084
THAT.

61
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,319
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION, TONIGHT

62
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,620
IN MY REMARKS I TOOK OUT THE

63
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,456
LETTER FROM SEPTEMBER 2015 THAT

64
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:07,659
CANADA TRUMP SIGNED.

65
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:09,227
WANTED HIM TO SIGN THIS LETTER

66
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:10,061
TO ACTIVATE THE GRASSROOTS.

67
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,463
HE SAID WE NEED SOME PROMISES,

68
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:13,531
SOME COMMITMENTS FROM THE

69
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,065
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.

70
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,933
HE LOOKED AT THE LETTER AND

71
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,602
TALKED ABOUT PARTIAL-BIRTH

72
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:20,238
ABORTION.

73
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:23,474
SIGNING CAPABLE UNBORN.

00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:25,677
CERTAINLY MOVING, AS SUGGESTED

TONIGHT, THE FUNDING FROM

76
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:28,479
CLINICS THAT PROVIDE ABORTIONS

77
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,347
TO THOSE THAT PROVIDE TRUE

78
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:32,050
WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES LIKE

79
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,750
MAMMOGRAMS AND SCREENINGS AND

80
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,085
OTHER SERVICES.

81
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,119
HE LOOKED AT IT AND HE SAID

82
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,187
THAT'S ALL FINE, BUT WHERE IS

83
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,289
ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT

84
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:39,290
HILLARY CLINTON, AND HE ADDED

85
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,491
STUFF ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.

86
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:41,559
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A COPY

87
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,326
OF THE LETTER AND HE SIGNED IT

88
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:44,962
AND IT WENT ON AND ON ABOUT HOW

89
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:46,364
EXTREME SHE IS, THAT SHE WOULD

90
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:48,466
TAKE THE BABY OUT OF ITS

91
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,133
MOTHER'S WOMB.

92
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,069
HE FOLLOWED IT UP ON

93
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,237
OCTOBER 19TH AND GAVE THE MOST

94
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:54,839
IMPASSIONED DEFENSE EVER HEARD

95
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,640
FROM A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

96
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:55,940
GOING.

97
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,676
LET'S REMIND EVERYBODY THIS IS A

98
00:02:58,676 --> 00:02:59,610
MANHATTAN MALE BILLIONAIRE WHO

99
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,645
FOR MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE HAS

100
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:03,181
SAID HE WAS PRO-CHOICE.

101
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,048
>> Laura: HE DOESN'T REALLY

102
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:06,484
MEAN IT.

103
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,252
>> LOOK AT HIS RECORD.

104
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:09,087
MEXICO CITY POLICY.

105
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,421
FIRST PRESIDENT EVER TO ADDRESS

106
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,689
THIS GALA.

107
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:12,690
FIRST PRESIDENT EVER TO ADDRESS

108
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,659
THE MARCH FOR LIFE AND

109
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:15,359
MIKE PENCE OF COURSE IS HIS

110
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,127
FIRST VICE PRESIDENT TO DO THE

111
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,128
SAME THING.

112
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:18,863
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT

113
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:20,531
THE POLICIES AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

114
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,966
WILL PROBABLY SAY THIS IS JUST A

115
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:22,366
GOOD START.

116
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:23,067
>> Laura: THE ISSUE OF CHINA

117
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,070
IS BIG NOW BECAUSE SO MANY OF US

118
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,838
SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

119
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:30,308
OF HIS TOUGH LINE ON CHINA.

120
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:33,478
THE CHINA 2025 PLAN SEEKING TO

121
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,479
DOMINATE EVERY MAJOR INDUSTRY,

122
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,813
STOLEN OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

123
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:36,581
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN FANTASTIC

124
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:39,317
ON THIS ISSUE BUT THIS IS WHAT

125
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,084
CHUCK SCHUMER SAYS.

126
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:41,686
LET'S WATCH.

127
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:42,420
>> I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

128
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,490
THE PRESIDENT'S HEMMING AND

129
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,190
HAWING OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS

130
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,792
WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA.

131
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,094
YOU COULD SAY THAT PRESIDENT XI

132
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:51,129
IS WRITING THE ART OF THE DEAL,

133
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,631
NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

134
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,666
UNFORTUNATELY EVERY TIME

135
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,901
PRESIDENT XI FLATTERS OUR

136
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:59,003
PRESIDENT HE SEEMS TO BACK OFF A

137
00:03:59,003 --> 00:03:59,403
TOUGH DEAL.

138
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:01,405
YOU'VE GOT TO BE TOUGH ON CHINA.

139
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:04,075
YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ACTIONS

140
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:04,609
MATCH OUR RHETORIC.

141
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:05,510
>> Laura: IN MY MIND THE WORST

142
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,213
THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS THE

143
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:11,649
DEMOCRATS OUT-POPULIST THE

144
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:13,918
PRESIDENT ON THIS ISSUE.

145
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,319
THAT WOULD BE A GIFT.

146
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,120
CAN YOU REASSURE VIEWERS DENY

147
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,522
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO

148
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:18,890
RETAIN HIS STRENGTH AND APPROACH

149
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,291
TO CHINA GOT HIM ELECTED?

150
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,293
>> THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THIS

151
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,161
TODAY AND THE OVERALL PLACE

152
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:25,696
WHILE THE CAMERA WAS ROLLING.

153
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:26,230
HE WAS MEETING WITH

154
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,298
PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH KOREA

155
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,065
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR

156
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:30,301
FROM THE BEGINNING HE THINKS

157
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,403
THAT THE IMBALANCE, UNFAIR

158
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,873
NUMBER

159
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:36,674
NONRECIPROCAL TRADE DEALS ARE

160
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:37,441
KILLING THE AMERICAN WORKER AND

161
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:40,011
HE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR THEM

162
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,879
FIRST.

163
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,781
HE TALKS ABOUT THE $500 BILLION

164
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:44,882
TRADE DEFICIT WE HAVE WITH

165
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:45,683
CHINA.

166
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,084
AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE HAPPY

167
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:48,286
THAT AT SOME OF THESE

168
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,120
NEGOTIATIONS IN BEIJING AND HERE

169
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,055
LAST WEEK AT THE WHITE HOUSE

170
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:54,358
THAT CHINA SIGNALS A MOVE TO BUY

171
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:55,459
MORE AGRICULTURE, BUY MORE

172
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:57,295
ENERGY FOR EXAMPLE.

173
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,863
BUT THE PRESIDENT ALSO, IF HE

174
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,698
THINKS THE DEAL IS NOT GOOD FOR

175
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:01,532
AMERICANS, HE'S HAPPY TO WALK

176
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:02,466
AWAY FROM IT.

177
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,669
HE'S BEEN DOING THAT HIS ENTIRE

178
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:05,870
CAREER.

179
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:08,039
CONCERNED THAT YOU HEAR MARCO

180
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,474
RUBIO, SCHUMER, THEY SEE AN

181
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:11,475
OPENING HERE.

182
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:14,078
TRUMP DOMINATED THAT SPACE IN

183
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:14,912
2016.

184
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:15,746
NO ONE HAD DONE IT LIKE HE HAD

185
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:16,080
DONE IT.

186
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,685
NOW THEY SEE SOUR GUM AND

187
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:21,886
SOYBEANS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN

188
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,087
OUR ENTIRE TECH SECTOR THAT HAS

189
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:24,488
GOTTEN RIPPED OFF AS THEY

190
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:25,890

HERE.

193
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,460
THEY ARE NOT PLAYING SHORT BALL.

194
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,728
THEY ARE PLAYING LONG BALL FOR

195
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:33,598
TOTAL DOMINATION.

196
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,633
>> TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY

197
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,068
TRANSFERS.

198
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:37,869
U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVES WENT

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,338

INNOVATION, STEALING OUR FUTURE

202
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:44,876
FRANKLY.

203
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,677
>> Laura: DIFFERENT SIDES ON

204
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:47,912
THIS, IS THERE A REAL WAR GOING

205
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:48,279
ON INSIDE?

206
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,182
>> NO, I THINK PEOPLE LIKE TO

207
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:51,949
COVER PALACE INTRIGUE INSTEAD OF

208
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,118
LEARNING THE POLICIES.

209
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:54,819
>> Laura: HUGE DIVIDE IN THE

210
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,488
PARTY ENTREE.

211
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:59,257
>> HE CAME OUT, I THINK ONE OF

212
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,692
THE ISSUES THAT HE WAS ABLE TO

213
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:03,060
ELEVATE, TWO OF THE ISSUES THAT

214
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,663
DONALD WAS TO ELEVATE AS A

215
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:06,964
CANDIDATE FOR MIRED IN LOW

216
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,699
SINGLE DIGITS TO PUTTING OUT

217
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,634
THERE ON THE PLATFORM WAS

218
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:13,170
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND TRADE.

219
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,472
LITTLE SINGLE DIGITS ALL THE WAY

220
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:14,772
OUT.

221
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:18,276
IT'S ALL ABOUT FAIRNESS TO HIM.

222
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:19,510
IT'S FAIRNESS TO AMERICANS.

223
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,913
>> Laura: NORTH KOREA,

224
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:22,914
SHIFTING, MOVING, CAN YOU TELL

225
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:25,283
US ANYTHING NEW ON THAT?

226
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,184
>> THE WHITE HOUSE PUT OUT A

227
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,185
STATEMENT TONIGHT ASKING THE

228
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:29,921
PRESS TO SIGN UP IF THEY ARE

229
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,088
GOING TO COVER THE SUMMIT IN

230
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:31,455
SINGAPORE.

231
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:33,291
>> Laura: I WANT TO COVER IT.

232
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,792
>> WE ARE STILL PLANNING ON JUL

233
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:34,825
>> WE ARE STILL PLANNING ON JUL2

234
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:34,859
>> WE ARE STILL PLANNING ON JULH

235
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:35,493
>> WE ARE STILL PLANNING ON JUL.

236
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,627
THE PRESIDENT MADE IT VERY CLEAR

237
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:37,929
FROM THE BEGINNING AND SET IT

238
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:38,963
AGAIN TODAY THAT IF IT HAPPENS

239
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:40,665
THAT'S GREAT, IF IT DOESN'T

240
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:41,632
HAPPEN THAT'S OKAY TOO.

241
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,468
WE ARE STILL WAY AHEAD.

242
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:46,304
IT WAS STILL MADE TREMENDOUS

243
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,138
PROGRESS THERE BECAUSE OF

244
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,106
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP.

245
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:49,874
WITHOUT HIM NORTH KOREA WOULD

246
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,677
NOT BE TALKING TO SOUTH KOREA.

247
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:53,477
THOSE THREE AMERICAN DETAINEES

248
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,011
WOULD NOT BE BACK.

249
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,446
>> Laura: HE WAS HINTING THAT

250
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:57,148
PRESIDENT XI WAS PART OF IT.

251
00:06:57,148 --> 00:07:00,518
>> HE SAID I THINK THE PRESIDENT

252
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:04,322
IS A WORLD CLASS POKER PLAYER.

253
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,723
SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING -- WHAT

254
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,892
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID IS THAT

255
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:09,493
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

256
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:10,194
PROGRESS, CONTINUE TO TALK.

257
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:11,028
BUT THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO HAVE

258
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:13,497
A SUMMIT.

259
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:15,099
THE GOAL IS DENUCLEARIZATION OF

260
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:15,833
THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND THAT'S

261
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,268
WITH THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING AT

262
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:17,635
WITH THE PRESIDENT IS LOOKING A

263
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:17,902
AT.

264
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:18,869
>> Laura: JOHN BOLTON IS GOING

265
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:20,705
TO BE GOING ON THE TRIP?

266
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:21,639
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE.

267
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,506
>> Laura: I SHOULD HOPE SO.

268
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:24,475
THEY DON'T WANT IN THERE BUT I

269
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:25,743
HOPE HE DOES.

270
00:07:25,743 --> 00:00:00,000
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE AWARD.
