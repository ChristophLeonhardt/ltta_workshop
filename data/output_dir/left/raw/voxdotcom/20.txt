1
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:08,930
In Sweden, more than 82.6% of people over
18 turn out to vote in elections.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,830
82.6%!

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,139
In the U.S., just over half the voting age
population shows up to the polls.

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,930
We’re getting our asses kicked by Denmark,
South Korea, the Netherlands and a whole host

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,830
of other developed democracies.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,660
If we re-sort this chart to show what percent
of registered voters actually voted - we’re

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,400
near the top of the list!

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,269
The U.S. has a huge gap between the share
of people who can vote, and the share of people

9
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,809
who actually do.

10
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,780
But it turns out, a lot of these countries
are doing something really simple, that could

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,700
make that gap disappear.

12
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:51,219
If you take all 50 states, and rank them by
the share of eligible voters — that’s

13
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:56,699
citizens over 18 who aren’t felons — that
actually voted in 2016, you can see a huge

14
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:57,729
variation.

15
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,869
Now let’s look at the states that let you
register when you show up to vote on election

16
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:02,949
day.

17
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:04,129
Notice something?

18
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,280
The states with the highest turnout rates
all have it.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,890
All the states below the national
average— well, they don’t.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,800
Most of them make you register nearly a month
in advance.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,140
And there’s a whole host of reasons people
might not be registered - nearly a third

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,620
of unregistered Americans say they intend
to and just haven’t gotten around to it,

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,390
others say it’s inconvenient or they just
don’t know how.

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,280
In Minnesota, 12% of the people who voted
in 2016 registered on election day.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,180
That’s 350,000 people.

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,560
Maine, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Idaho
all had lots of people registering last-minute,

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,930
too.

28
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,760
Oregon has figured that out.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,580
Turnout increased nearly 4% from 2012 to 2016
— that's more than double than what we saw nationally.

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,130
It’s no coincidence that in 2015 Oregon
became the first state to enact automatic

31
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,490
voter registration - or AVR.

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,690
Here’s how it works.

33
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,209
Anyone who has an interaction with Oregon’s
Department of Motor Vehicles is automatically

34
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,719
added to the list of registered voters, called
a voter roll.

35
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,110
The state sends them postcards giving them
a chance to register with a party or decline

36
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,510
to be registered.

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,900
It changes the system from opt-in to opt-out.

38
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,549
So a sixteen year old getting their
driver license will be automatically registered

39
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:27,810
to vote when they turn 18.

40
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,400
A new resident who changes their ID or
car registration will also be automatically registered

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,000
In total, 272,000 people were registered this
way.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,400
And more than a third of them actually voted
in 2016.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,019
Of those voters, 37% of them were under 30.

44
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,129
Compare that to the voters who were registered
through the traditional fill-out-the-vote--for

45
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:52,150
method, and only 13% were under 30.

46
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,779
AVR got more young people to come out on election
day.

47
00:02:55,779 --> 00:03:01,079
13 states and Washington, DC have already
passed AVR legislation and will have it running

48
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,609
by the 2020 election.

49
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:07,760
It’ll have massive effects in California
alone, where there are nearly 7 million eligible

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,810
people not registered to vote yet.

51
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,540
Let’s go back to that chart with all the other
countries.

52
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,959
These are the ones who have some form of automatic
voter registration.

53
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,739
If the US implemented it nationally, we could
literally move up in the world.

54
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,669
Plus, it’ll make our voting system more
secure and more accurate.

55
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,219
Now when you move, you have to
re-register to vote.

56
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:35,379
That creates duplicate registrations and makes
it harder for voter rolls to be kept updated.

57
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:39,370
With AVR, your registration moves with you
- no duplicates.

58
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,340
It’ll also be cheaper.

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,300
Everything will be electronic and there will be millions
less registrations to process.

60
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,159
But most importantly, it could automatically
register nearly 50 million Americans, who

61
00:03:52,159 --> 00:00:00,000
would then gets a chance to help decide how
the country should be run.
