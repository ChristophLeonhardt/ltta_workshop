as the hurly-burly of political life returns to Washington DC many of you may be wondering what's Hillary Clinton up to how she occupying her time now that the election is over and she's lost to a rank amateur with funny orange hair who said enough outrageous things to end the careers of 15 other politicians but instead only ended her career sending her into a well-deserved oblivion that left her questioning why she had allowed her husband to cheat on her and publicly humiliate her all those years because she thought her marriage was her best path to the White House when it turned out only to be her best path to being cheated on and humiliated and then kicked to the curb like the old crumpled tin can which he's actually come to resemble if you look at her from just the right angle so that you might find yourself suddenly saying hey wait that's not a crumpled old tin can that's just what Hillary Clinton looks like now that she's been rejected by the nation whose public offices she ruthlessly peddled in exchange for cash wait I forgot the subject oh yeah many of you may be wondering what's Hillary Clinton doing now okay maybe not many of you but some of you a few okay no one's wondering but the point is I think as human beings we can all open our hearts to Hillary and sympathize with the fact that it's painful when your career ends in a ruinous shambles that stands as a rebuke not just to your political philosophies but your behavior your personality and you're painfully obvious greed and hunger for power not to mention your fashion sense and your hideous screeching very and you the public might want to know how a person recovers from such a setback and learns to live again in hope and joy before ultimately dying in bitterness and obscurity well you'll be happy to know that Hillary is beginning to break out of the initial depression that caused her to lock herself in the cramped hour room of her gothic Chappaqua mansion and screamed Donald Trump's name to the indifferent heavens at the top of her lungs she now gets out and regularly takes brisk walks through the woods along with three men in white suits who routinely take the matches and gasoline cans away from her she sometimes enjoys a day trip to New York City and often visits Trump Tower where she's fondly known as the shrieking bag lady and of course she enjoys spending a time with family and says she looks forward to teaching her granddaughter that there's nothing a girl can't accomplish if she allows powerful men to walk all over and then sells her soul for every opportunity to seize cash and position and then goes down in metaphorical flames so all in all I think I can reassure you that Hillary Clinton is going to be okay and while yes she may be depressed to realize she'll never be running for office again she at least knows she can serve her country by never running for office again trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the and true Clavin show you
