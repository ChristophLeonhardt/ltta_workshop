on according to Joseph curl over at Daily wire former Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein on Friday turned himself into police in New York what he likely will face serious charge and connection charges in connection to sexual assault of at least two women more than 100 reporters cameramen and photographers were on hand as when she made the perp walk at the New York Police Department's first Precinct in lower Manhattan Weinstein who is 66 quote stepped back from a black SUV wearing a blazer and carrying books under his arm and lumbered into a Manhattan police station before a crowd of news cameras he didn't respond to shouts of Harvey according to the Associated Press after several accusations ranging from inappropriate touching to rape emerged against Weinstein last year dozens of women came out to join the barrage the chorus grew by the day more than 75 women who've now accused the former movie producer but Weinstein escaped criminal charges until now on what charges he will face the AP said quote the exact charges against Weinstein still had not been made public early on Friday - law enforcement officials told the AP the case would include allegations by Lucia Evans an aspiring actress who has said the Hollywood mogul forced her to perform oral sex on him in his office she was among the first women to speak out about the producer one official said it's likely the case will also include at least one other victim who has not come forward publicly as of yet so the crime could carry up to 25 years in prison so presumably Weinstein would die in prison in the interview at The New Yorker last October Evans said that Weinstein forced her into the sex act during a meeting at his office in 2004 she was then a rising senior at Middlebury College she said over and over I don't want to do this stop don't I tried to get him away but maybe I didn't try hard enough I didn't want to kick him or fight him actress Rose McGowan of course has come out and said the Weinstein raped her in 1997 in Utah Sopranos actress anabella's Chiara said he raped her in a New York City apartment in 1992 Norwegian actress and Natasha Amalfi said he attacked her in a London hotel room in 2008 according to the Associated Press and of course at the Cannes Film Festival an actress named Asia Argento delivered an intense speech before presenting the Best Actress Award telling a horrific story about Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein quote I was raped by Harvey Weinstein here at con I was 21 years old this festival was his hunting ground so obviously this is a big blow to sort of Hollywood prestige as it has been for mantra member the entire meeti movement was launched on the back of the Harvey Weinstein scandal Weinstein for his part his lawyer said in court that Harvey Weinstein did not create the casting couch Harvey Weinstein was not the creator of the casting couch the casting couch that I've discussed before on the show is this old Hollywood trope that men who are in charge of Hollywood would cast you in a film if you slept with them right the casting couch was kept in the office and then if you wanted to be cast in a film you want to make your way in Hollywood then you were forced to sleep with the producer and they made light of it movies going all the way back to All About Eve right and All About Eve which won Oscar for Best Picture Marilyn Monroe plays this young up-and-coming kind of floozy who wants to get the Broadway stage and so she is is trying to woo fat ugly old producer who's kind of portrayed in the in the movie as this kindly old gentlemen right this kind-hearted old gentleman he's kind of a goofball generally the Hollywood casting couch has been a part of Hollywood for as long as Power has been a part of Hollywood and the truth is that this sort of behavior by men toward women has been around as long as men have wielded power in order to gain sex for themselves it's also been largely turned Hollywood for years without any sort of repercussions because many women were willing to use the casting couch in order to get ahead there are a lot of women who might not have wanted to do that in the best of all possible worlds but they were willing to do it so you get into some dicey areas of consent when you have particular people who are okay with sleeping with a reference on like their first choice is not that first option it's not something that they would love to do in a scenario where they had the option not to do it but they weren't exactly forcibly raped right so when we're not talking about Harvey Weinstein who apparently forcibly right people but there are a lot of situations in Hollywood in which young women know that the best way to get ahead is to use their sexuality to get ahead and then you run into some dicey areas with regard to consent because if you say to women you shouldn't be doing this right there's a problem you should try to be avoiding this then those women might say well you're violating my grounds of consent you're saying that I can't be a fully autonomous individual capable of making my own decisions and then what you end up with is weird situations in some cases I assume where you could have the possibility that a woman goes to an office the producer hits on her she sleeps with the producer and then ten years later when it comes out that the producer is actually a rapist in this case Harvey Weinstein then women come forward they say well I was pressured into sex - which is true informally if not formally this is the problem with an entire culture that prizes promiscuity as a high value now again that's no excuse for actual rape it's not a it's not ending any excuse for actual use of force Harvey Weinstein should go to jail for the rest of his life if any of these allegations are true he should go to jail for the rest of his life for the rest of his life but it is also true that Hollywood has forwarded this kind of conduct for a very very long time and it is widespread in Hollywood just the latest case in point a bunch of women are now accusing Morgan Freeman of inappropriate behavior and harassment according to CNN yesterday quote a young production assistant thought she and landed the job of her dreams when in the summer of 2015 she started working on going in style a bank heist comedy starring Morgan frame michael caine and alan arkin but the job quickly devolved into several months of harassment she told CNN she alleged that Friedman subjected her to unwanted touching and comments about her figure and clothing on a near daily basis Freeman rest his hand on her lower back will rub her lower back she said in one incident she said Freeman kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear he never successfully lifted her skirt she said he would touch it and try to lift it she would move away and then he'd try again eventually she said Ellen Ark and made comment telling him to stop Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say well this raises the question it's why no one else on staff was willing to tell Morgan Freeman to stop and the answer is because if you tell powerful Hollywood men to stop is the other side of the coin you tell powerful Hollywood men to stop you will never get a job again and this is exactly what happened with Harvey Weinstein if anyone complained about Harvey Weinstein he made sure that nobody in town worked yet in Quentin Tarantino admitted as much he said that Harvey would call around and say this person is a bad person to work with you don't want to work with this girl because she's trouble and then these people wouldn't get jobs ever again so when you have powerful men in positions of high power this is why you need more virtuous men in the industry this is why you need more virtuous standards in the industry you need a bunch of people there who are not engaged in the sexual revolution ethos of consent is the only value because consent is sort of fungible in a lot of these cases in some cases it is not and in some cases like it sounds like with Morgan Freeman it is not but there are some cases in which they're a bunch of men who have had women saying yes to them for their entire career because women want to get ahead in some of these cases and then these men decide okay well that means all women want it because they're scumbags hey this sort of activity is going to be more common in any society in which there is a certain amount of credibility given to men with power to do whatever they want and there is a certain amount of reluctance to call out women for acting in fashions that forward this particular standard so you need two things in order to stop okay let's come at this from the from the other end you need two things in order to stop what's happening in Hollywood what you need is number one a bunch of women who are willing to say no to directors and then report on them and number two you need a society willing to hear that and a bunch of men in Hollywood who are willing to stand with those women and I think I should reverse the order of those what you really first need is a bunch of men who are willing to report other men for doing these terrible things and those men need to stand up and they need to say no to people like Harvey Weinstein a Morgan framing anymore alan arkin situations you need fewer Jason Bateman's the reason I mentioned Jase Bateman is because you now have a situation with Jason Bateman where he did an interview with the New York Times and a bunch of these men it was the Arrested Development cast in in this lengthy Q&A in the new york times of the cast of Arrested Development Jeffrey Tambor is still included on the show of course one of the stars of the show he was recently fired from transparant after sexual harassment allegations and the conversation eventually turned to Tambor's behavior on the side of arrested development according to Jezebel reportedly there was an incident onset in which Tambor yelled at his co-star Jessica Walter who is who plays Lucille Bluth and all of the men on the show seems disturbingly interested in brushing it off according to Jezebel so Tambor apparently said that he expects to be part of the next season and Bateman said I wouldn't do it without you I can tell you that and then Jessica Walter interjected that that that Tambor had had ripped on her had yelled at her had lashed out at her and Bateman immediately jumped in to defend Tamra said we've all done this by the way Walter said you've never yelled at me and Bateman said not to belittle what happened well she never yelled at me like that and then Bateman jumped in he said this is a family and families you know have love laughter arguments again not to belittle it but a lot of stuff happens in 15 years I know nothing about trans parent but I do know a lot about Arrested Development and I can say that no matter what anybody in this room has ever done we've all done a lot with each other for each other against each other I wouldn't trade it for the world and I have zero complaints well nobody asked you there talking to Jessica Walter and then David cross again all of these people are on the Left all of these people are big believers in the feminist movement and the meets you movement okay so you have to ask yourself why is it that all these believers in the media movement in the feminist movement are so willing to overlook the misconduct of people with whom they work and the answer is because in Hollywood this is the way Hollywood works it is the way Hollywood has always worked when Harvey Weinstein goes out there and says I didn't invent the casting couch yes he's disgusting yes the casting couch is disgusting yes moral people like me have been saying for a long time people who are religious have been saying for a very long time the casting couch is disgusting and the morality of Hollywood is disgusting but Harvey Weinstein when he says the casting couch was not invented by Harvey Weinstein he's not entirely wrong in that sense he's wrong that he's not a rapist I mean it sounds like she probably is a rapist but again this puts you in a weird position because all of these men who are supposedly in favor of feminism are standing around defending guys who are acting like under grease balls so here's David Cross he says you know one thing Jeffery has said a lot of times that I think is important I often hear from somebody in his position is that he has learned from the experience and he's listening and learning and growing that's important to remember well it's or more important to remember that you shouldn't have acted like that in the first place and then then the New York Times reporter asked if somebody approached you and said okay here's an actor that admits he routinely yells at directors and assistant directors at co-workers assistants would you hire that person and tambour said I would hire that person if that person said you know I've reckoned with this and then Bateman said again not to belittle it or excuse it or anything but in the entertainment industry is incredibly common to have people who are in quotes difficult and when you're in a privileged position to hire people or have an influence and who does get hired you make phone calls and you say hey so I've heard about I've heard X about a person who I tell me about that and what you learn is context and you learn about character and you learn about work habits Wharf X Worth work ethics and you start to understand because it's a very amorphous process this sort of bleeping that you do you know making up fake life it's a weird thing and it's a breeding ground for atypical behavior and certain people have certain processes in other words all of these people are difficult people because they're artistes and artistes have to be given more leeway to do what it is they do accept those people have victims and then a bunch of women who don't want to get involved in the casting couch system are forced into the casting Cal system specifically because they will lose jobs if they do not it's it's a real disaster area all the way through have a little more to say on this first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at us ECA so this is it this is the end I've been talking about this

five chances to win a thousand bucks for your dream Kimber and again get armed up as a as a law-abiding Second Amendment loving citizen you SEC a makes it easy for you defend my family now dot-com so you've got Harvey Weinstein you've got Morgan Freeman you've got a bunch of people defending people like this you know it's it's really troublesome and it's troublesome again because so many folks in Hollywood proclaim that they are the moral standards that we must follow these are the moral standards who they are the they are the light bringers when it comes to morality and decency and when it comes to feminism - they're the light bringers ok well they're gonna have to learn how to balance two things one is the ability of women to consent to relationships with more powerful men and the second is to call out men who are doing terrible things and they haven't learned how to balance these two things yet they haven't learn how to balance these two things because these two things are sort of hard to balance and in an era where is it power relationships that are supposed to define what's wrong or is a consent that's supposed to define what's wrong this has not been made clear by anybody on the left yet now I'm of the opinion that all relationships should number one be consensual and number two power should not be abused in this way by powerful people and women should not give in if they can help it - abuse of power in this way if physical force is not being used like be willing to lose the job in order not to be abused by man but I understand it's a difficult decision that women should not have to make and that's why we need to change the system from within well that's going to require two things it's gonna require again powerful people coming out and speaking out against this n it's going to require an embrace of a different sexual ethos that does not value the art and the artists and promiscuity above everything else it's going to require a reversion back to more traditional morality regarding how people interact men and women interact and I understand this makes a lot of people I'm left uncomfortable but it's very difficult to have it both ways you can't say that men and women are just playing around and then also be surprised when it turns out that men are willing to abuse that system in order to do terrible things that doesn't mean the men shouldn't be punished they should be punished but the snapback is what some people in Hollywood are finding so odd to deal with and again I think that there is I think there's a way to fix all of this but I don't think it can be fixed in the absence of a route change in mentality about how men ought to treat women how women ought to treat men fortunately there is good news the good news is Hollywood has its priorities straight when it comes to president Trump Sir Robert De Niro who's a frequent critic of President Trump and he's been playing Special Counsel Robert Muller on Saturday Night Live he talked Tuesday about he'd like to bar the president from eating at his Nobu restaurant chain which I'm sure Trump will just be devastated to learn the Daily Mail reported that DeNiro a co-founder of the Nobu restaurant and hotel chain insisted he would not let Trump eat in his restaurants and that he would leave any other eatery where the president entered if he walked into a restaurant I was in I'd walk out said DeNiro while chef Nobu Matsuhisa who's De Niro's corner then joked it was his dream for Trump to sit next to Janeiro so he could make them sushi DeNiro of course has spent a lot of time ripping on Trump this is the way it works in Hollywood the sort of virtue signaling the matters is not the virtue signaling where you stand up and you call out actual predators in Hollywood that's not virtually signaling real virtue signaling real virtue signaling of course is going and talking about how Trump should not come into your restaurant and by the way it's not because Trump has this record with women okay again people in Hollywood probably don't care about Trump's record with women they care a lot more about President Trump's politics they'd say the same thing about George W Bush when Mitt Romney was running in 2012 they would have said the same thing about Mitt Romney because these are the actual values in Hollywood Hollywood likes to pretend that it has values with regard to treatment of women it doesn't ok Hollywood has no regard for the values of women it has no regard for the the the sexual autonomy of women it has no regard for power relationships between men and women but it certainly wants to make sure that a Republican doesn't enter its restaurants there are certain things in Hollywood that'll ensure that you never work again being against same-sex marriage is one of them being pro-life is a pretty good indicator you're gonna have a tough time working but sexually harassing the help for years on end you can do that so long as you are a powerful dude and most people will go along with it and that's why as soon as you see a gap in the in the particular dam that's holding back all these revelations in cases like Harvey Weinstein or Morgan Freeman you watch there will now be 15 women who come forward and say all this stuff because they've been held back by this entire wall of silence that's been created around Hollywood by Hollywood about this sort of evil behavior by people like Harvey Weinstein and people like Morgan Freeman all these women are gonna come forward now because now they feel it's safe there's safety in numbers to come forward but you don't wanna be the first one because if you're the first one you end up like Rose McGowan and you lose your job and you never work again Hollywood's fault really truly egregious and disgusting stuff okay well meanwhile Joe Biden former vice president of the United States he is out there politicking he obviously wants to run for president again he wants to run for president he ran in 2008 didn't go anywhere he wants to run for president again in 2020 against President Trump and he has a serious shot of winning the nomination because presumably President Obama would endorse him as his former VP well Joe Biden is doing this routine where he is suggesting the president Trump has abandoned GOP values I find this utterly hypocritical and hysterical this is not your father's Republican Party this is a different deal who we are they're not who America is but what they are doing is they're sending a vision of America that's damaging that is hurting us with this phony populism okay so a nationalism I love the Joe Biden's out there it's a different Republican Party the Republican Party has changed that route here's what the studies show the studies showed that the Republican Party has been in since 2010 absolutely stagnant in terms of its politics it has not move to the right it has not moved to the left his policies are exactly the same as they were after the Tea Party those have not changed the only party that has moved is the Democratic Party which has shifted radically to the left when Joe Biden ran in 2008 every Democratic candidate on stage endorsed traditional marriage okay when he ran in 2008 nobody on stage would been paying homage to Bernie Sanders they all thought he was a kook in a nut job and now the entire Democratic Party has moved radically to the left and when you hear Joe Biden talk about how much the Republican Party has changed and moved remember Joe Biden is the guy who said in 2012 just six years ago he was saying the Mitt Romney wanted to put y'all back in Chains so Mitt Romney was the great outlier was Mitt Romney who changed the Republican Party Mitt Romney's Mathers moderate a candidate as Republicans have run in the last 25 to 30 years and yet there was Joe Biden dripping on the Republican Pyrus when you hear Democrats rip on the extremism of Republicans understand that they've been ripping on the supposed to extremism of Republicans no matter how moderate at any point the hypocrisy of Joe Biden is truly astonishing here but guess we shouldn't be astonished by Joe Biden the guy wants to run for president he understands he has to run to the hard left if he wants to cut off people like Pamela Harris and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders okay so I want to give you the update on the house in

Democrats still struggling for an actual message the the battle for the house has turned not in their favor Shawn trend who's an excellent analyst over at Real Clear Politics he says this if you had asked me six months ago who I thought would win control of the House of Representatives in 2018 I wouldn't have hesitated before answering quote it's early but Democrats are heavily favored although conventional wisdom has been very slow to catch up with a raft of GOP retirements and highly vulnerable open seats a president with job approval ratings in the and a generic ballot lead for democrats in the double digits it was increasingly difficult to spell out a path to victory for republicans in fact things were bad enough that it appeared their losses could grow into the 40 or even 50 seat range things have changed says Sean Trend if the election were held today it is not clear who would hold the chamber I might put a thumb on the scale for Republicans but right now and it is still early the house is likely to be closed like really close once again conventional wisdom seems slow to catch up where the animal is still discussing the toxic environments for Republicans okay president Trump's job approval rating has been rising there a bunch of reasons for people are tired of the Muller investigation the passage of the tax cut the good economic news the generic ballot is moving look at the polls it is narrowing dramatically yeah in mid-december the Democratic leaders around 13 points today it is it three points that is a massive movement and special elections are not a good metric this is the most important thing you've been hearing a lot about Democratic turnout in special elections and Sean Trans has hold up a second he says some point to Democrats performance in special elections as a sign that their voters are energized this is undoubtedly true I pointed to a similar phenomenon in late 2013 so I do think special election outcomes are interesting but there are three problems here I did not make specific projections from these in 2013 because we don't have a lot of experience projecting a midterm election from special election results these are informative data points but until we have more experience seeing how models based upon them perform we should prefer establish metrics like job approval and the generic ballot second special elections all involve open seats the one set of elections that didn't involve open seats exclusively in Virginia and New Jersey brought about a set of results that are a lot less encouraging for Democrats they lost in Trump districts and they won in Hillary districts well if that's replicated in 2018 Democrats would fall just shy of winning the house so bottom line is the prospects are looking much better for Republicans than they were even a few weeks ago and a lot of that is the extremism of Democrats well I got Joe Biden out there claiming that Donald Trump has moved the Republican Party in radical new ways my god look at these Republicans with their populism here's the reality the Democrats are radical hey the latest point being obviously the ms-13 argument right where President Trump called ms-13 a bunch of animals and then he doubled down on it and Nancy Pelosi said that this was terrible she said we believe some of those who are attracted to the political arena it's a government in public service that we are all God's children there's a spark of divinity among every person on earth and she's defending ms-13 now as I said earlier this week President Trump has a magic power his magic powers he can make Democrats defend legitimately anything so one of the polls say about the ms-13 issue well according to the hill 56 percent of American adults in the Harvard Cape's Harris Poll said referring to members of the gang as animals is fair compared to 44 percent who said the characterization was unfair a slimmer majority 52 percent added that the comments that dehumanized members of ms-13 are acceptable so in other words Trump's on the right side of the American public on this particular issue by the way he is also on the right side of the American public with regard to the kneeling situation the kneeling in the NFL situation as I mentioned yesterday I'm not a fan of the president's interjecting himself into arguments about what a private corporation the NFL should do about its own employees exercising their right to kneel okay like it's a private company they can do what they want I think the president Trump polarizing the issue is not good for the country but as I mentioned yesterday it is good for him there's no question that he's on the right side of the polls on this particular issue most Americans do not have tons of sympathy for people who are kneeling for the National Anthem they just don't and this is why when Democrats people I'm left come out and labeled Trump an idiot for him ripping on people who are kneeling for the national anthem they're only hurting themselves Doug Baldwin is a wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks and he calls Trump an idiot over all of the kneeling controversy well this is the kind of stuff Trump eats up and spits out it is great for Trump listen you know I respect the man because it's a human being you know first and foremost but he's just being more divisive which is not surprising most Americans look at the situation in the NFL they don't think Trump was the one who was originally divisive on this most Americans think that it was the NFL players who decided to kneel from the national anthem a signal of unity in the United States who are actually being divisive in this entire process so the more people react to Trump by taking the side of the people who are kneeling that's exactly what Trump wants this is what's so funny if the left even half understood what was going on in this particular debate maybe they might make a more shaded argument maybe they would argue as actually people like me have argued that Trump should not involve himself in these particular issues because it polarizes the country but they are in favor of people standing for the national anthem the NFL has a right to do what it wants to do the hilarious thing about all of this is the NFL is getting just shellacked over this decision right Fox Sports 1 has a show with with Skip Bayless and Skip Bayless and his co-host I can't remember who it is they were talking about this this NFL controverts they called it a dark day in American sports Bell is highly respected very he's not a shock jock he's not go over the top with his criticism he's very even-handed he is a black man but that's a strong powerful conclusion from Jarrett Bell about what just happened and it does feel to me from this side of the desk like it was a dark day in American sports okay it's so hilarious that this is the this quote dark day in American sports this co-host is Shannon Sharpe they're the this is such a dark day in American sports the NBA has had this exact same policy this exact same policy for a long time okay the NBA's had this policy since like 1994 1995 and yet nobody's complaining about that they only complain when the NFL changes the policy because it looks like a quote unquote win for Trump and by the way the implication that Trump is a racist and that's the reason he cares about all of this yesterday Donald Trump pardoned the late black boxing champion Jack Johnson hey Jack Johnson was issued a posthumous pardon he was the first African American heavyweight champion who's jailed a century ago due to his relationship with a white woman okay he was accused of violating federal law by transporting his white wife a woman who later became his wife named Lucile Cameron in 1912 across state lines is supposedly violated the Mann Act and sexual trafficking of course that wasn't true was trumped up but Jack Johnson was was convicted he was convicted nonetheless he died in 1946 okay the president signed the pardon and yet we're still hearing from people that obviously all of his stances here are due to racism it just doesn't wash in terms of public relations okay so I have a little bit more to say about sports and where America stands in just second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at Tommy John so Tommy John makes the best underwear that you will ever wear okay you don't think a lot about your underwear but the truth is that after you've worn your underwear this cheap pair of underwear that you got after you've worn it five or six times it's gone through the wash it's starting to fall apart it's starting to sag it's starting to roll on you okay Tommy John doesn't do any of those things more than half a million dudes have switched to Tommy John these proprietary fabrics innovative designs to make sure the legs never ride up the waistband never rolls down it is impossible to get a wedgie yeah beum would've been amazing for me as a teenager if it'd been

listen for free we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation okay so final note on this this whole NFL controversy I think the whole thing is overblown I think it's overblown because two things can be true at once one we do not want to pressure our corporations to crack down on people for their speech second if it is actively impeding a corporation's ability to distribute the product okay if the free speech amounts to you providing a design flaw in the product itself then the corporation it seems to me has every right to do something about you okay so as I say me speaking at a private college and being barred from a private college they can do it but I think it's stupid you boycotting the NCAA over an unrelated bathroom policy in the state I think is stupid you boycotting Brendon H from Mozilla Firefox because Brendon ice was Pro traditional marriage and has no effect on the product that's stupid but the product the NFL puts on the field includes all of the visual product before the game including the national anthem so if the NFL says listen we're losing money because of this because the product we are putting on we believe to be inferior at least in terms of how it is grabbing audiences well they have every right to do what they're going to do and I think that's how you balance these two things okay there are certain things that are inherent to the development to the product there are certain things that are not again if they wanted to kneel for the national anthem every day before they started their factory work I don't see how that would really be a problem but all of this is televised and has an impact on whether people watch the games or not so people who are failing to make this distinction they're friends of mine who I think are failing to make this distinction I rarely disagree with my good friend David French David had a piece in the New York Times in which he argued that the NFL should not have changed policy they should have allowed everybody to continue kneeling I'm not quite as sold on that and I don't equate every situation in which a private corporation is trying to save its product from with every other situation in college campus is a place obviously for exchange of ideas NFL pregame doesn't seem to me like that's what it was generally for as a rule okay so let's go through some mailbag let's do some mailbag so Aslan says hey Ben I'm a subscriber and watch you all the time well Thank You Asselin I know how to combat the general ridiculous nature the left and their meltdown over current events I'm a bit confused about one of my friends who worked for the bush administration and since President Trump has been elected he's gone full sjw and left ideals he argues that his era of the Republican Party is dead because of Trump and everything from does against his view of what the Republican Party was in president's past my question is the Republican Party so very different under Trump than some of his great publicans of old or is he just being ridiculous most of trumps policies are great I think as far as conservative values but he's just a buffoon at times in a way no president has been before thanks huge fan ok so this is the serious question right we talked a little bit earlier about Joe Biden and Joe Biden saying the Republican Party has massively shifted what was stupid about what Joe Biden said is he was saying that there was this populist move in the Republican Party the policy is exactly the same as it has been for years and President Trump has governed more conservatively than george w bush president Trump's first year-and-a-half of policy is a conservative dream in many ways really like as a conservative but somebody who's very very skeptical of President Trump's policies I can say I've been very pleased by his policy decisions that said is Trump a difference in kind for the Republican Party yes I mean he is I mean there's no question that he's a man of different character than Republicans have elected before in some ways that's a good thing right in some ways it means that he violates certain taboos that need to be violated and that was certainly true when he moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem for example it's also true when he attacks actual fake news but they're obviously downsides to this president Trump lacks character when it comes to women I think this is obviously clear president Trump has made statements that I find absolutely morally egregious have called them out on this show many times you know that is a sea change for Republicans particularly if they go along with that sort of thing publicly which is why I've always said that if Republicans want to maintain their moral Center they should clap for President Trump when he does good things and he's doing a lot of those things and they should boo President Trump when he does something bad because President Trump can take it and he's a human and that means that all humans should be treated equally not as idols not as as objects of pandering but President Trump when he says something truly bad everybody should say hey that's truly bad you shouldn't say that and when he does something's really bad they should say hey that's truly bad you shouldn't do that no he does something good you have to praise him I think if you take this tack with your friend then maybe you'll be a little bit more open to your messaging about the fact that Trump really hasn't changed a lot of policy on the Republican side of the aisle because he hasn't Jonathan says hey Ben should the government force force food producers to put nutritional information on their products Thanks no I don't think they should I don't think that the government has any business telling food producers what information to put on their products in fact I'm not I'm a libertarian this I don't even think I'm not a big fan of the FDA I think that the food and drug administration the idea that you needed a government agency to ensure the safety of your food I think that's largely stupidity I think there are private companies the could do just the same thing now we have Saget's that rates restaurants I don't see any reason you can have a private organization that essentially licenses food not licenses in the sense they could ban a food but looks at a food and says whether it is healthy or not whether it is whether it is good or not right there are private organizations that I think could do this fairly well and you know if one was dishonest and there would be others that competed with it I think it's something the market certainly has room for I don't think there's a market failure taking place in food in other words right you don't actually have to have an FDA telling you the ingredients in your light bulbs although presumably they do there are government regulations that force that sort of thing I don't think that's necessary because I don't think that most producers have an interest in killing their consumers or making food so bad for them that they never want to eat that food again and competition allows you to do this first of all I think that the nutritional product information would end up on the bottles anyway because I think that some creative producer would say you know what we should undercut our competition by saying we are completely transparent about what's in our food as opposed to our competition which presumably would then drive the competition to actually put the nutritional products out there into mean you see this all the time right you see this in terms of diet products so I'm not sure why it shouldn't apply to food more generally Richard said you've mentioned usually when talking about one of your sponsors about how you use an electric razor and only part of your face for religious reasons could you explain the doctrine in more detail please sure I mean the quick answer is that in the Bible it says that you're not supposed to shave the corners of your beard oh and Orthodox Jews take that to mean that you are not supposed to use a straightedge to shave your face and so I use an electric razor around my entire face and then the draw line and then below the draw line are there certain commentators who say that you're allowed to use a straightedge below there because you know when you're shaving your neck that's really not a part of your beard okay Dylan says hey Ben what is your opinion on wives not taking their husband's last name when they get married do you believe that is harmful to their union or is this something that shouldn't be of concern Thanks so my gut reaction is that it is important for wives to take their husband's last name because you are now forming an independent unit and you should have the last name because now you are part of a team if you join the New York Yankees you don't maintain that you are a Yankee Cardinal right if you sign as a free agent and you become a Yankee and it seems to me the same thing should be true now there's a there are people who say well why shouldn't you take your wife's last name well listen if you want to do that you can and I think that's sort of emasculating to dudes because I do think that there are male and female roles in a relationship and a man who feels that he doesn't have any sort of leadership in his relationship with his wife is going to feel emasculated this is just the natural human process not saying whether it's right or wrong that is just natural I'll tell you this one night when we got married when I got married my wife I said she didn't have a middle name and her last name her her maiden name was Toledano and my wife wanted to I said to her that she could do like my mom and she could actually take her maiden name and make it her middle name like I shouldn't even have permission she can do whatever she wants right she's an autonomous human being but I said if you want to do that it's fine with me I don't care and it came time for us to go over to Social Security office for to formally change her name to - you know her name Shapiro - dr. Shapiro and she and she went in and she said you know I decided not to do it and the reason I decided not to do it is because I want to take your last name it's it's my gift to you and I you know I'm not I'm still member of my old family but this is our family now our family is the Shapiro family and it meant a lot to me it did mean a lot to me as man I promise you women if you ask men whether it means something to them most men will say it means something to them because it is a sacrifice a woman is making of her family name I and that should mean something that's a sacrifice okay so yes I think it's important and I think that it's it's enough of an important thing that you should ask your potential spouse about it and I don't think that if let's put this way I think that the types of people do different things on this issue if you are a hardcore feminist and you think that it's a real sacrifice to give up your last name for your husband's last name because this means he owns you now I would suggest that you're not being generous enough to the husband that you're marrying I don't think the matter of ownership I think it's a matter of let's be on the same team okay if we that's just my general take David says hey we often talk about the left side ia's and practices is self-destructive and I agree on those points but do you have an expectation that the left will ever actually destroy itself and become genuinely relevant in American culture and policy it seems like they keep drinking poison but it's only making them stronger they shoot themselves in the foot and it never really slows them down no I don't think the left is ever going to go away I think it will always be with us I think that leftism Springs from a couple of elements of human nature one is jealousy and the other is utopianism and I think as long as jealousy and utopianism are parts of human nature there will be a left to fight because jealousy is the basis for economic policy you earn more than I do there Fridays are of your money and utopianism is the idea that if we just shift government policy there will be a huge number of new human beings will be created and these new human beings will be transcended human beings better human beings more generous human beings and then we will all have a beautiful world where the unicorns prance and play in the meadows with raindrops smiles right it's just it's stupid but unfortunately this is part of human nature we think we can change everything it's why whenever anything bad happens anything bad in the United States our first reaction is why didn't the government do something about it and we should really be asking ourselves why didn't I do anything about it and if I didn't do anything about it can anyone do anything about it and is it possible that the collective can't solve everything and then maybe you say okay well maybe the collective can solve this one but we should at least ask ourselves the question leftism is rooted in human nature okay just as conservatism I think is actually more of a I think conservatism is actually more of a departure from human nature right your kid is a leftist your two-year-old is leftist my two-year-olds leftist my two-year-old wants stuff when he wants it and he wants it right now he doesn't care how he got it and then Cameron came about he doesn't care that if he screams now now now now now it's not just going to appear and he thinks that if I give things to him then life will magically be transformed hey and you are a communist in your relationship with your own family right you have a joint bank account you share with your family you earn from each according to his ability to each according to his need is basically the rule inside my house anyway but that does not mean that that is a good idea for the governance of society as a whole or that it instills any sort of responsibility which is why you have to fight a communists signature of the family with the idea of teaching responsibilities and inculcating responsibility in your children brian says hi ban O'Sullivan's law states that any institution not actually on the right will eventually end up on the left the truth of this statement is indisputable we see examples of this every day the news media educational institutions at every level religious denominations professional organizations civic organizations like the Boy Scouts corporations what causes of this is there any way to counter it well in many ways this answer is the same as my last answer any organization that is not overtly embracing particular responsibilities of particular principles about personal responsibility and god-given rights eventually is going to be eaten up by this quest for cosmic justice that Thomas Sol talks about when Thomas Oil has a great book called the quest for cosmic justice I highly recommend that everybody read it and it basically explains the the desire of human beings to look for answers in places where they can't get answers and organizations particularly our collective in nature and that means that they tend to think they can solve everything through the collective so it's not really surprised they move in a collectivist direction michael says hello benevolent and fearless leadership here Wow I like that what are you getting me his Holiness Pope Saint Michael Knowles and sweet and st. sweet little ELISA for their upcoming wedding I absolutely love the show and left his tears taste even sweeter and daily wired tumblr thanks well Michael I appreciate it and I appreciate the Michael is the person who wrote that write it says what are you getting His Holiness Pope Saint Michael moles and the person who wrote this is Michael so Michael nice try but Michael already knows when I got Michael because we were sitting next to each other okay so this is a good story so the other day there was an event that we had to go to I was a really terrific event with some some big-name Hollywood folks at like a launch it was really fun and I was and our entire company won so there they're a bunch of people from our company we're supposed to go we were all supposed to carpool over so I come out it's it's like 12:00 noon I'm supposed to be there at like 1225 and I have been told that we are all going to carpool out together so I'm in my studio at the Daily wire offices and I saunter my way on out at about 12:10 because I've been doing work you know to make everyone money and then I walk out of my office and I look around and everyone is gone everyone is gone and I look around and then I asked my assistant the only person left in the office you know where'd everybody go and she said where was everybody supposed to be somewhere I so I don't know I mean you tell me and I call my business partner and he says you're supposed to be here right now and right at that moment all of my co-workers and employees walk in without me because they left me there that's the kind of office we have here at daily wire so anyway we go to this lunch and I sit down and unfortunately I would seated directly next to the execrable Michael moles and I mean listen I didn't make the seating chart okay not on me so I sit down and Michael moles is sitting next to me and then it hits me that Michael's wedding is coming up in the next week and that I have not gotten him anything for his wedding frankly I hadn't really thought about because who cares I mean it's Knowles's wedding like really so anyway I'm sitting next to him and it strikes me that you know if I don't get him anything like right now I will forget about it five minutes later and then I just won't get him anything and I wouldn't care would save me money but I think he'd feel bad about it and then we'd all have to feel bad and then it would cause a little drama that she Knowles is and in anyway he's sitting next to me so I pull up his his wedding registry I get him a blender and then I turned him and say congratulations you have a blender so that's basically what I got my god I'm a blender okay there's your answer story for a short question okay Christian says hey Ben what is your stance on the argument that the executive branch should practice discretion on enforcing laws as it is parts of the checks and balances well I think the executive branch obviously has the veto power but in terms of enforcing laws that are already on the books by Congress it is job to enforce laws not to decide not to enforce the laws unless those laws are expressly unconstitutional now this is a serious issue okay the executive branch does have the ability to say listen this law is unconstitutional I'm not going to enforce it unfortunately we've now shifted our vision of the government so that the executive branch does not have the duty to independently say that this is not actually constitutional I'm not going to enforce it instead they kick it over to the judicial branch they kick it all the way over to the judicial branch and they say well I'll enforce it whether its constitutional or not it's up to the judiciary to decide that is false that it's false okay the system was not built for that the system was built so that members of the executive branch take a constitutional oath to uphold the Constitution and that means Velocity's unconstitutional even over their veto they should at least be able to challenge Congress on it and then if Congress wants to impeach Congress can impeach but everybody was supposed to uphold their constitutional duty not just the judicial branch Justin says hey Ben hypothetical question if you were US president had majority support in the House and Senate what policy would you push regarding taxation in the nation mostly I'm interested in how you'd want to collect taxes from citizens like income tax tax brackets if at all how much to tax etc well you know I've moved sort of in favor of the idea of a fair tax which is essentially a national sales tax with with certain exceptions for people who are more impoverished I like that idea better than the income tax I don't think it's the government's business how much money I earn and I think the income tax is rife with corruption there's a reason that the state of California has the highest income taxes in the nation and also the number-one rate of tax deductions in the nation so we pass all these stupid high taxes and we vote for all the politicians to pass the stupid high taxes and then we all take enormous deductions in order to avoid the high taxes we just voted for I don't like the income tax I think that the fair tax is probably the way that I would go okay a couple of more here Matthew says hey Ben I'm a practicing Christian for over a decade have been a vocal conservative for about the past four to five years lately I've been having church members come and telling me I need to stop posting my political beliefs that I need to choose between my faith and my politics I need advice on how to handle that I don't believe I should have to choose between the two well I find that a weird argument and frankly I think faith should be the value system that under your politics and these should be able to make a secular argument for whatever politics you hold but I think that we all have certain basic assumptions about the nature of life as I say in my new book and I think that those values are allowed to come from a religious place so that this is a weird argument to me I don't really understand it Spencer says if you were writing a contemporary comic version of Dante's Inferno what eternal punishments or rewards would you assign to President Trump Bernie and Hillary for instance would Bernie be condemned to forever reach for pudding cups the receipt out of his grasp and to what gruesome tortures would you consign Michel moles in the afterlife I shudder to think of it so the gruesome torture to which I would consign Michel moles is that he would have to talk constantly into a camera that was dead that would be his gruesome torture and also he would have to wear a shirt at all times wouldn't matter he goes in the shower he has to wear a shirt he's never allowed to take off his shirt that's the rules hey that those those are the rules okay as far as Trump Bernie and Hillary I think life has a beautiful way of giving certain punishments to people who deserve them Hillary's already got her punishment she's not President of the United States and she got humiliated by Donald Trump so I think that eternal that would probably be her punishment right also she'd have to she'd have to probably sit there and grin as people made speech after speech about how great her husband was I think that would be an excellent eternal punishment for Hillary Clinton for Bernie Sanders I think that the eternal punishment is that he should actually have to be he should have to work for a living like he should actually have to go work like get it get a real job like a normal person and then he should have to give charity like a normal good person would that would be his eternal punishment which sounds to me pretty good but for him it would just be terrible and president from sea turtle punishment he'd eternally be forced to stare at a Playboy centerfold forever but he can't do anything about it she just stands there forever and he just stares at her and there's nothing he can do it's just an eternal case of of the wants but not the gets so it would be I think that would be pretty fair for President Trump and Molly says hey Ben I'm participating in an archeological excavation the summer in Jerusalem I'm super excited but with all that has been going on lately my family's worried about my safety since you're more familiar with Jerusalem what would you say to help ease their minds about my safety Thanks well terrorism is extraordinarily uncommon in Israel is it is the source of very few injuries and deaths in Israel Israel is actually really safe at this point there are soldiers on every corner and there are certain things that you can avoid that the Israeli government will tell you to avoid but there's certain ways to make yourself safer just to show your family you'll take the safest possible measures you know yeah I know this is controversial inside Israel Pete a lot of people take the bus if I were an Israel I probably wouldn't take the bus that's a very common site for terrorist attacks to occur but that's because I'm over cautious again Israel is an extraordinarily safe place at this time ok so we will be back here next week with more mailbag let's do a quick thing I like and then a quick thing that I hate so yesterday I mentioned a show called the white queen all about Richard the third the last three episodes the show about Richard the third and they paint Richard the third in a very positive light another book that sort of paints Richard the third and a positive light is book called the daughter of time by Josephine tey one of the great mysteries of all time the book is all about basically a detective who's a frequent a frequent character and Josephine Hays novels and this detective this time is laid up in bed and he decides that he is going to unravel the mystery of what actually happened to Richard the Third's nephews I did Richard the third actually kill his nephews and the book is really gripping and really interesting and really historical so check it out one of the great mystery novels of all time the daughter of time by Josephine Tay makes for a good weekend read for sure okay a quick thing that I hate so when I say Hollywood is out of touch I mean Hollywood is really out of touch they did a movie called show dogs they show dogs is a movie about what you would think show dog stars Will Arnett as an FBI agent named Frank who is forced into partnering with the talking dog named Max voiced by Ludacris to infiltrate a prestigious dog show in the hopes of rescuing a kidnap panda yep sounds awesome but that's not the best part so the best part of this is that apparently there is a plot point involving max learning to cope with the idea of having a judge examine his genitals while competing in the dog show the problem is this is a movie for children okay and his daily waiter pointed out having a judge fondle a dog and then the dog talk about how good it feels is not really a great message to be forwarding for small children well now show dogs has actually been pulled from the theaters even leftist sources like Slate we're saying this is not really particularly great daily where I will say was I think involved in pulling it a week after its debut pulled an abysmal 6 million on its opening weekend a rotten score of 23% on the tomato meter well now the film's producers have released a statement apologizing to offended parent and they're gonna fix the film they've decided to remove those two scenes from the movie which were not appropriate for children that seems appropriate to me since I don't think the children should be taught that it feels good to have your genitals stimulated by an adult that's really disgusting so thanks Hollywood I can't imagine why you're so screwed up in every possible way okay well we will be back here next week with much much more I'm Ben Shapiro this is Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Senya Villarreal executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer is Mathis Glover and our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike her Amina hair and makeup is by Jesuit Vera the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing
