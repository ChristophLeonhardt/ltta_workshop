three weeks ago NBC at a cabinet retreat McKenna was so sure she had the reason for this year's BC forest fires figured out just watch well I've now been in British Columbia for much of this week and certainly seen the forest fires across British Columbia just demonstrates the climate change is having a real impact on Canadians you seen the kind of smelled smoke and when there's smoke there's fire and when there's fire there's climate change except well before that statement from the Braniac McKenna RCMP investigators had already determined that many of the wildfires plaguing the Okanagan were the result of our sin a bitter sweet climate change causes pyromania - is there absolutely nothing that climate change cannot do but as recently as just a few days ago Catherine McKenna was saying that if carbon tax skeptics didn't get on board with her plan to tax the air to change the weather they'd be losing out on an impossible sum of money a completely different amount than what she's blackmailing us with now McKenna tweeted this out last week would also be good if the federal Conservatives had a plan to tackle climate change like the Harper government they fail to understand the real cost of climate change to Canadians from extreme heat to fires to flooding and the 30 trillion opportunity of climate change let me say that again for you 30 trillion dollars that's a lot of money in fact it's so much money it's around 15 times the size of the entire Canadian economy how much scrutiny do you think McKenna got from the mainstream media for her eleventy billion trillion carbon tax opportunity gaffe you know it's next to nothing of course right now back in April of 2016 McKenna told the World Bank Group carbon pricing leadership coalition that climate change was a three trillion dollar opportunity two years later in April of 2018 in a press release from her very on ministry McKenna said that climate change would open up nearly 23 trillion dollars in opportunity by July though of 2018 McKenna told CBC's as it happens that climate change was a one trillion dollar opportunity she can't keep her BS straight but you dear citizen you're the dumb one if you don't want to pay a carbon tax based on McKenna polling numbers just out of the ether that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
