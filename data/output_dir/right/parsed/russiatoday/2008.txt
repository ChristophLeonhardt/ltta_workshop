welcome to nifty Novgorod Stegen a brand
new arena that would see some serious
action when Brasher plays Argentina just
one of those six games being played in
this magnificent arena and I can promise
you it won't be on snow it will be on
grass of course but what is this city
all about
I'm Peter Schmeichel and I'm about to
find out the first thing you need to
know about Newton or Calliope said it
was restricted doggy as it used to be
called about 30 years ago was completely
off-limits for foreigners and the reason
for that was this the gas car factory
during the Second World War the factory
was forced reduce military equipment and
because of that it got completely
flattened by German bombs look at that
that's how hard you have to push
amazingly enough it took only a hundred
days for the local community to
completely rebuild the plan and it was
then when they was up and running that
the city became a restricted zone
I'm just going to go free I'm building
half a car this is now a multi-billion
dollar operation and around 20,000
people work here it used to be a lot
more actually five times more but then
these fellows arrived
I think it's everyone's lunch hour now
I'm on my own the factory is mine I'm
completely on my own I could actually
now make my own car and no one would
know better
I just came from the factory where they
produce the cars and I'm driving a
gazelle next then it's nice absolutely
nice but you know I'm a big boy
I like the big toys I need a little bit
more and I know they've got exactly what
I'm looking for it's a racing job it's
set up for desert races not for icy
conditions like this so it is for me
it's a little bit of a good place and
it's also set up for professional
drivers and I'm not a professional
driver
but I'm getting that
this truck is a fun ride but it's so
difficult I need a bigger car a bigger
chock a bigger whatever put an easier
drive so let's see what this is
it's got eight years and I've got no
clue I think it's much easier to be a
goalkeeper than a rally driver if I was
to have it plays in a rally team this
would be my job my plays support vehicle
driver
that was really good fun
I really enjoyed that and how can you
not but what I also like to do is to do
a little bit of culture and what I found
was this museum it exhibits 12,000
pieces of Russian historical art and
amongst them this one and I really like
this this is a Kandinsky he was credited
for being one of the pioneers in
abstract art
so nothing abstract about this I'm now
going to take you right back to the
Russian art route we all know this you
know this is called Akuma
it's everywhere in Russia can't seem it
before I'll convince you
you've probably seen it with this it's
so common that even FIFA are using it on
their official merchandising
now I'm gonna have a go at painting one
of these and this is Oksana hello would
you teach me how to paint yes
I am officially challenged
you see mine's not too bad but I think
she needs a little bit of practice
