not too far away from July 4 1776 was the French Revolution and and it's echoes in Liberty Galit a fraternity and why is it that the American Revolution took the path it did it didn't lapse back into a monarchy it didn't lapse into the horrors that we saw can you tell me the difference morally between the u.s. Revolution and the French Revolution and I mean what on the other hand what does America owe to the french thinkers and to the british thinkers well you know I mean that's a complex question but for one thing one of the most important things about the American Revolution was it wasn't a radical break with the past it was actually carrying on the tradition of the past into the next level it was people who said you know you have deprived us of our rights as Englishmen by taxing us without representation we want those rights back and we want to construct a government in which that will be protected where the people we will be protected from that ever happening again the French Revolution got caught up in a romantic abstraction of what human beings could be there was this underlying idea that if you stripped away Society if you stripped away history if you stripped away culture man would be born free I was Rousseau said men a man is born free but is everywhere in Chains but what the founders of America understood was no it was actually an accretion a collection of tradition custom culture that had led us to this freedom and wouldn't lead us on to the next freedom so they didn't break the bonds with the past they didn't break the bonds with humanity they didn't break the bonds with culture they simply wanted to extend them to the next phrase using as you say a lot of the thinking that had been going on in the 18th century the French made the terrible terrible mistake of thinking that human beings are naturally good and it's culture that makes them bad the left makes this same mistake right now is you are speaking they are making that same mistake what the what the Americans understood was that no mankind is greedy it's the loves men love power they love wealth and what they tried to do is create a system in which each person's desire to do better would somehow lead to everyone doing better and write this as we sit here the United States Constitution is the longest lasting Constitution in human history and that's a beautiful beautiful thing that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
