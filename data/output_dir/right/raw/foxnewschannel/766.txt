1
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:03,641
ELECTION.

2
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:05,310
>> KRISTIN: THANKS SO MUCH, DAN

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,078
SPRINGER IN LAS VEGAS FOR US.

4
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:08,112
>> LELAND: NOW PERHAPS WE GET

5
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:09,380
ANSWERS OR SOME OPINIONS.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,049
A NEW POLL SAYS IMMIGRATION EVEN

7
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:12,984
ABOVE THE ECONOMY IS ISSUE

8
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,586
NUMBER ONE FOR THE MIDTERM

9
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:14,953
ELECTIONS.

10
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:16,321
SO DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR

11
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,322
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO

12
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:20,258
MAKE A DEAL OR STAY IN THEIR

13
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:21,459
CORNERS AND BLAME THE OTHER

14
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:21,793
SIDE?

15
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,595
JOINING US NOW TO DISCUSS, RADIO

16
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:28,833
HOST WADE SMITH AND GARLAND

17
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,167
MISSON.

18
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,768
NICE TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

19
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:33,304
WADE, DO REPUBLICANS HAVE AN

20
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:35,640
EXPOSED FLANK HERE IF THEY CAN'T

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,774
GET SOMETHING DONE, GIVEN HOW

22
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:38,843
MUCH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT

23
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:39,477
IMMIGRATION REFORM?

24
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:42,013
>> IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS

25
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:43,514
WHERE DEMOCRATS HAD THEIR

26
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:44,616
OPPORTUNITY WHEN THEY HAD THE

27
00:00:44,616 --> 00:00:45,917
SUPER MAJORITY BACK A COUPLE

28
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:47,252
YEARS AGO.

29
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:48,152
REPUBLICANS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

30
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:49,654
THEM GET SOMETHING DONE BUT

31
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,189
GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS,

32
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,624
DEMOCRATS JUST WANT THIS AS

33
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:54,225
AN ISSUE THAT THEY CAN CAMPAIGN

34
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,860
ON AND IF REPUBLICANS GET IT

35
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,562
DONE, THEY GET IT DONE, GREAT.

36
00:00:57,562 --> 00:00:58,863
IF THEY DON'T, IT'S ANOTHER YEAR

37
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:00,732
OF ELECTIONS.

38
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:01,933
>> LELAND: GARLAND, TO YOU, IT

39
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:04,535
SEEMS AS THOUGH WE HAVE

40
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:05,670
REPUBLICANS DIGGING IN THEIR

41
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,971
HEELS.

42
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:07,772
DEMOCRATS THOUGH ALSO ARE

43
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:08,773
DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS.

44
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:10,808
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF APPETITE

45
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:11,643
FOR COMPROMISE.

46
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:12,944
YOU AGREE WITH WADE THAT IT'S

47
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:14,112
BETTER AS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE?

48
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:16,047
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS KNOW

49
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:17,582
THAT TRADITIONALLY THE INCUMBENT

50
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:18,716
PARTY IS KIND OF SWIMMING

51
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:20,518
AGAINST THE TIDE GOING INTO THE

52
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:22,020
MIDTERMS AND THE REPUBLICANS

53
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,855
HAVE THE MAJORITIES IN BOTH

54
00:01:23,855 --> 00:01:26,391
HOUSES SO THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE

55
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:28,092
CASE OF WHAT THEY'VE

56
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:28,526
ACCOMPLISHED.

57
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:30,228
SO FAR, THEY SEEM TO BE ARGUING

58
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:31,329
OR THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE

59
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,564
ARGUING, HEY, OUR MAJORITY ISN'T

60
00:01:33,564 --> 00:01:36,701
BIG ENOUGH WHICH IS STILL

61
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,869
ADMISSION THAT THEY HAVEN'T

62
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,804
GOTTEN THE THINGS THEY WANTED TO

63
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:40,305
GET ACCOMPLISHED.

64
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,040
THE DEMOCRATS I THINK HAVE THE

65
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,041
UPPER HAND.

66
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:43,941
>> LELAND: CLEARLY REPUBLICANS

67
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,076
HAVEN'T GOTTEN EVERYTHING THEY

68
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:45,977
WANTED DONE DONE.

69
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:47,845
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO SOME OF

70
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:50,114
THE RHETORIC COMING FROM BOTH

71
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:50,415
SIDES.

72
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,849
TUCKER CARLSON LAST NIGHT WITH

73
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,185
HIS THOUGHTS ON THOSE CALLING

74
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:54,786
REPUBLICANS EVIL.

75
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,020
TAKE A LISTEN.

76
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,389
>> THE THING ABOUT PURE EVIL IS

77
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:59,724
YOU CAN'T REASON WITH IT.

78
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,826
YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH PURE

79
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:03,361
EVIL OR REACH SOME KIND OF

80
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,762
COMPROMISE WITH PURE EVIL.

81
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:07,298
PURE EVIL CAN ONLY BE DESTROYED

82
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:08,433
BY FORCE.

83
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,934
GIVEN THAT, IT'S NOT SURPRISING

84
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,936
THAT THE LEFT IS NOW MOBILIZING

85
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:14,072
TO HARASS, FIRE AND IF NECESSARY

86
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:15,807
PHYSICALLY ATTACK ANYONE WHO

87
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:16,908
DISAGREES WITH THEM ON

88
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,042
IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THE OTHER

89
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:20,912
SIDE, AGAIN, PURE EVIL.

90
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:23,448
>> LELAND: AND WE SAW EVIDENCE

91
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:25,016
OF THIS CONTINUING LAST NIGHT.

92
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:26,918
THE TWEET THIS MORNING FROM

93
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:28,586
SARAH SANDERS, IT'S SHAMEFUL

94
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:30,054
THAT DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA

95
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:31,556
EXPLOITED THIS PHOTO OF A LITTLE

96
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:32,657
GIRL TO PUSH THEIR AGENDA.

97
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:34,992
SHE WAS NOT SEPARATED FROM HER

98
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:37,028
MOM, SEPARATION HERE IS FROM THE

99
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:38,029
FACTS.

100
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:40,765
DEMS SHOULD JOIN POTUS AND FIX

101
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,501
THE BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

102
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,236
SHE TWEETED SHE WAS ASKED TO

103
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:45,970
LEAVE A RESTAURANT LAST NIGHT

104
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,105
BECAUSE SHE WORKS FOR THE

105
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:47,472
PRESIDENT.

106
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:49,240
SHE SAID SHE LEFT AND THEN

107
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,876
SECRETARY NIELSEN ALSO PROTESTED

108
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:53,211
AND FORCED TO LEAVE A

109
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,446
RESTAURANT, TAKE A LISTEN.

110
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:57,815
>> SHAME!

111
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:06,591
SHAME!

112
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:07,325
>> LELAND: REALLY, THESE ARE THE

113
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,826
TACTICS OF THE DEMOCRATS?

114
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:10,228
>> I THINK ULTIMATELY WHAT IT'S

115
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:11,662
GOING TO COME DOWN TO IS THIS.

116
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:13,264
WHEN WE GET TO THE MIDTERMS,

117
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:14,599
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT THE

118
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,500
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE POLICY,

119
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,701
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT WHETHER

120
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:19,036
THE REPUBLICANS CAN GET A POLICY

121
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:19,370
THROUGH.

122
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,738
SO RIGHT NOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

123
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,173
THE ANGRIEST AND THE PEOPLE WHO

124
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,408
ARE ACTING OUT THE MOST, THEY'RE

125
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:24,709
GOING TO BE THERE AND THEY'RE

126
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,411
GOING TO BE VOTING BUT THEY ONLY

127
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,845
GET TO VOTE ONCE.

128
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,348
WHO CAN GET -- CAN THE

129
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:31,482
REPUBLICANS GET LEGISLATION

130
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,384
THROUGH AND CONVINCE THE

131
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:34,619
INDEPENDENTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO

132
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,720
AREN'T OUT THERE IN THE STREET

133
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,255
OR WHO AREN'T DOING THE

134
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:38,256
OVER-THE-TOP THINGS, THAT'S WHO

135
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:39,457
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOCUS

136
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:39,724
ON.

137
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:40,591
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO IGNORE

138
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:42,393
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND OF THE

139
00:03:42,393 --> 00:03:47,598
MOST OUTLANDISH.

140
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:48,466
>> LELAND: IT'S MORE DIFFICULT

141
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,668
TO IGNORE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE

142
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:52,703
DOES THIS PLAY INTO THE

143
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:53,538
REPUBLICANS' HANDS?

144
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:55,840
IT SEEMS LIKE IT MAY MOTIVATE

145
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,541
UNDECIDED VOTERS BACK TO THE

146
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,008
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

147
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:58,576
>> IT DEFINITELY WILL PUSH

148
00:03:58,576 --> 00:03:59,677
VOTERS BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN

149
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:01,312
SIDE WITH THE WAY THAT NIELSEN'S

150
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:03,214
GETTING TREATED, WITH THE WAY

151
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,949
SARAH SANDERS IS GETTING

152
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:05,416
TREATED.

153
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,951
REPUBLICANS LOVE SARAH SANDERS.

154
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,686
DEMOCRATS MAY NOT LIKE HER.

155
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:09,987
THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAND

156
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:10,388
HER.

157
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:12,457
REPUBLICANS THINK OF HER AS A

158
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:12,857
SWEETHEART.

159
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:13,624
SHE'S FIGHTING FOR DONALD TRUMP

160
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:15,359
EVERY DAY.

161
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:16,427
THE REASON WE'RE IN THIS

162
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,362
SITUATION IS BECAUSE THE POLICY

163
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,697
BEFOREHAND WAS 20 DAYS IN A

164
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:23,201
DETENTION SENDER FOR A FAMILY,

165
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,136
-- CENTER FOR A FAMILY, YOU'RE

166
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:26,170
RELEASED.

167
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,771
THIS CAN'T STAND.

168
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,573
WHETHER OR NOT THE REPUBLICANS

169
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:29,474
GET SOMETHING PASSED, IT'S NOT

170
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:30,608
GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT

171
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:34,745
THE REPUBLICANS WILL WIN IN THE

172
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:35,179
MIDTERMS.

173
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,080
>> LELAND: GARLAND, YOU GET THE

174
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,481
FINAL WORD.

175
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:38,583
>> IF WE RECALL BACK TO 2010,

176
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:42,019
UNDER OBAMA, THE DEMOCRATS HAD A

177
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,754
MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES AND THEY

178
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:45,256
WEREN'T ABLE TO PRODUCE AS MUCH

179
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,391
AS MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE

180
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:47,425
AS MOST PEOPLE WOU HAVE

181
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:47,492
AS MOST PEOPLE WOULDAVE

182
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:47,525
AS MOST PEOPLE WOULD HE

183
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:48,526
AS MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIKED.

184
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:50,394
THEY KIND OF HAVE TAKEN A

185
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:50,728
BEATING.

186
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:51,729
THE REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING A

187
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:51,996
LOT.

188
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:53,364
THEY'VE GOT THE MAJORITY.

189
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:55,566
IF THEY DON'T PRODUCE, THEY'LL

190
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:55,900
PAY.

191
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,068
>> LELAND: DO YOU WORRY THE KIND

192
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,803
OF RHETORIC WE'RE SEEING NOW

193
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:01,672
PUSHES SORT OF MODERATE OR

194
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:02,840
UNDECIDED REPUBLICANS BACK TO

195
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,741
BEING HARD CORE REPUBLICANS WHEN

196
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:05,776
THEY SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE BEING

197
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:06,110
TREATED?

198
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,512
>> I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT KIND

199
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:11,415
OF RHETORIC IS UNHEALTHY..

200
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:14,352
I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES THE

201
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:14,752
VOTERS.

202
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:15,253
>> LELAND: REALLY.

203
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:15,987
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

204
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:16,954
GOING TO VOTE REPUBLICAN ARE

205
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:17,822
GOING TO VOTE REPUBLICAN.

206
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:19,824
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDECIDED

207
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:21,826
ARE LOOKING AT THE ISSUES.

208
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:22,493
>> LELAND: WHY DO YOU THINK

209
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:24,896
THERE ARE NOT DEMOCRATS CALLING

210
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:27,298
OUT FELLOW CALL THEM

211
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:28,099
PROGRESSIVES, CALL THEM WHATEVER

212
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:34,038
YOU WANT, FOR THIS KIND OF

213
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:36,774
AND I HAVE

214
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:36,807
AND V HAVE

215
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:36,841
AND VITAVE

216
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:36,874
AND VITRIE

217
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:37,942
AND VITRIOL THAT WE'RE SEEING

218
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,143
NOW, IS THERE NO LINE FOR

219
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:39,510
DEMOCRATS.

220
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,546
>> WE USED TO CALL IT ON THE

221
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:43,347
LEFT OBAMA DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

222
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:46,150
I THINK WE HAVE TRUMP

223
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,984
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

224
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:48,452
I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE

225
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:49,754
EMOTIONALLY TRIGGERED BY DONALD

226
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,255
TRUMP THAT THEY'RE MAKING BAD

227
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:52,390
DECISIONS AND THEY'RE ACTING IN

228
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,393
WAY THAT'S ARE UNHEALTHY FOR OUR

229
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:55,726
SOCIETY.

230
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:58,029
I DON'T THINK IT'S A NEW

231
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:58,429
PHENOMENON.

232
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,764
>> THERE'S A LINE, IT'S THE

233
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:00,865
PARTY LINE FOR DEMOCRATS.

234
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:04,068
THAT'S THE ONLY LINE FOR THEM.

235
00:06:04,068 --> 00:00:00,000
>> LELAND: GENTLEMEN, WE
