1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
Wow, this is a Callaway Corvette aerowagen

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,860
it is the most powerful car made in the us period.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,380
It's supercharged with the supercharger pushing up all the way through the hood

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,520
767 Horsepower this car will go from 0 to 60 in 2.7 seconds. Which is nuts

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,740
So let's put it to the test. I'm going to head out to Rockaway for lunch,

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,880
and we'll see what this beauty can do

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,420
So Callaway the very same name that engineers golf clubs

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,060
modifies these Corvettes.

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,560
And in this aerowagen the main upgrade is the supercharged engine

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,860
and it's so fast

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,220
the fuel efficiency is

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,610
27 miles per gallon at speed on the highway

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:09,080
That's like prime optimum conditions, but it's still pretty incredible considering most cars with

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,760
757 Horsepower get Like 12 to 13 miles per gallon

15
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,419
So the Aerowagen part of the Callaway Corvette is totally new this year

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,979
It's a huge departure from what a typical corvette looks like and that's by design

17
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:31,559
The trunk is enormous, and that's what you're really getting by choosing to have this option

18
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:39,059
The interior is just like the regular corvette that you buy directly from Gm. It's very much like a cockpit

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,780
so the belt parkway isn't exactly the autobahn but I was able to get a feel for the strength of the supercharger

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,880
and I made it down to Rockaway beach in no time flat

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,900
The starting price is about 130 thousand dollars

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,080
the money goes towards the engineering that makes this car so powerful and fast

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,200
but still that is so much cheaper than what you might find at Ferrari or McLAren or Lamborghini

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:00:00,000
This can keep up with all of those cars, and it's a far less expensive
