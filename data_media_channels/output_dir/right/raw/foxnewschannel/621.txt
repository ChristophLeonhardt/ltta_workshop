WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD HER

37

TIMELY QUESTIONS OF A PRESIDENT

83
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:54,649

UNDER IDENTICAL CIRCUMSTANCES

85
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:57,519

FOR A PERSPECTIVE A COUPLE DAYS

87
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:03,658
AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS

88
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,930

DISHONEST SINCE HE ANNOUNCED HE

00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,289
PRESIDENT HAS ADOPTED A NEW

97
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:34,589
PHASE.

THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE I CALL

102
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:41,963
THEM.

103
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,466

00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,207
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS MATTER.

FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

108
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,612
WE ALSO INVITED OUR COLLEAGUE,

109
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,514
JORDAN FABIAN, WHITE HOUSE

110
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:00,548
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE HILL.

111
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,450
WE ASKED HIM BECAUSE DURING A

112
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,653
WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING LAST WEEK

113
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:05,153
THIS HAPPENED.

114
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:10,125
>> I'M GOING TO MOVE TO JORDAN.

115
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,160
>> YOU TOLD THE PRESIDENT --

116
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,229
>> ONCE AGAIN, I'M MOVING TO

117
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,932
>> HALLIE, GO AHEAD.

118
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:18,566
>> THANKS --

119
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,335
>> ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO TAKE A

120
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:21,536
QUESTION FROM JORDAN.

121
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,749
>> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT'S

122
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,484
HAPPENING NOW AND WHAT WE'VE

123
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:37,385
SEEN IN THE PAST?

124
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:40,255
>> WELL, SHEP, I CAN TELL YOU, I

125
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,128
KATELYN COLLINS IS COMPLETELY

126
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:47,595
UNACCEPTABLE.

127
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:51,966
COVER THE WHITE HOUSE.

128
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,568
IT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS AND EVER

129
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:53,902
WORKED.

130
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,470
I HOPE IN THE FUTURE THIS

131
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,338
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

132
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,640
LOOK, I MEAN, UNFORTUNATELY

133
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,308
THERE'S BEEN DUST-UPS IN THE

134
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,608
PAST.

135
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,210
I REMEMBER THIS NETWORK WAS

136
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,411
INVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF

137
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:04,312
SITUATION WITH THE OBAMA

138
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,748
ADMINISTRATION WHERE IT WASN'T

139
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:10,585
>> Shepard: AND YOU KNOW WHAT

140
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:10,952
HAPPENED?

141
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,320
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

142
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,155
JAKE TAPPER OF CNN STEPPED IN TO

143
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,991
BACK YOU GUYS UP AND SAID THAT

144
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:18,593
WE WOULDN'T REALLY ATTEND THAT

145
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,328
ROUND OF INTERVIEWS UNLESS FOX

146
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,663
NEWS WAS INVITED.

147
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:23,398
SO IN TIMES LIKE THIS, I THINK

148
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,233
IT'S GOOD FOR THE PRESS CORPS TO

149
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,935
UNITE AND REALLY RALLY AROUND

150
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:27,869
ONE ANOTHER.

151
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,838
I'M SEEING THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

152
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,773
I THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST.

153
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,274
>> Shepard: IN THAT CASE, IT

154
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:36,311
HAPPENED AFTER A SERIES OF

155
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:44,352
FOR ALL OF US, WAS WORKING FOR

156
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:46,154
US AT FOX NEWS AND YOU AT HOME

157
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,191
AT THAT MOMENT TRYING TO GET

158
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:50,925
ANSWERS FROM THE PRESIDENT.

159
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:52,394
SHE REPORTS THAT SHE WAS BROUGHT

160
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,262
IN TO A OFFICE OF BILL SHINE.

161
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:59,667
CAN YOU TELL US YOUR

162
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:00,335
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT EVENT?

163
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,236
>> I WASN'T THERE FOR THE

164
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:01,569
MEETING.

165
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,572
THE FACT THAT THIS IS EVEN A

166
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,811
PRESS CORPS.

167
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,546
THE POOL IS VERY IMPORTANT.

168
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,415
IT'S FOR ALL OF NEWS THE NEWS

169
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,516
MEDIA BECAUSE THERE'S LIMITED

170
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,217
SPACE TO HAVE EYES AND EARS

171
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:18,653
WHAT'S GOING ON AT ALL TIMES TO

172
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,555
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE

173
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,456
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OR

174
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:22,257
WHATEVER WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL

175
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,658
OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND FOR THEM

176
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,693
TO TAKE ANY STEP TO RESTRICT

177
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:26,895
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE

178
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:28,696
PRESS IS GOING TO STAND FOR.

179
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:31,399
>> THE BACKGROUND REASON ON THAT

180
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,902
IS THAT IF A PRESIDENT, ANY

181
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:36,905
PRESIDENT, IS ALLOWED TO CALL ON

182
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:39,274
THOSE THAT HAVE SEEN -- SEEMED

183
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,810
FRIENDLY TO HIM OR ACCEPTABLE TO

184
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,244
ANSWERS THAT MIGHT FLY IN THE

185
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,979
FACE OF FACT, HAVING A PROCEDURE

186
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,282
WHICH INCLUDES DISALLOWING THOSE

187
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:50,385
THAT WOULD ASK QUESTIONS OF

188
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,154
SUBSTANCE AND UNIVERSAL

189
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,560
NOT FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

190
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,194
>> RIGHT.

191
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,329
LIKE YOU SAID, THE PRESIDENT IS

192
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,864
FREE TO NOT ANSWER THOSE

193
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:03,231
QUESTIONS.

194
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,500
YESTERDAY WE SAW HIM ON TWO

195
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,634
OCCASIONS NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS

196
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:08,837
ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN OR RUSSIA.

197
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:11,606
THAT'S TOTALLY PREROGATIVE.

198
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,741
IT'S THE PRESS' JOB TO ASK THOSE

199
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,242
QUESTIONS.

200
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,243
ANY REPORTNER THAT SITUATION

201
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,579
WOULD HAVE ASKED THE SAME OR

202
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,214
SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO WHAT

203
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,756
BACK THAT SHE WAS NOT BEING

204
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:33,928
EVERY DAY.

205
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,197
OFTEN THE PRESIDENT TAKES THE

206
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:36,965
OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER IF

207
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,466
QUESTIONS, THIS IS PART OF OUR

208
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:38,733
JOB.

209
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,969
>> THANKS, JORDAN.

210
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,569
THANK YOU.

211
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,170
>> YOU TOO.

212
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,138
>> Shepard: FOR THOSE OF YOU AT

213
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,740
HOME, IF I MAY, JOURNALISTS ARE

214
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,809
NOT THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE.

215
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,744
IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

216
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:51,579
OUR PROFESSION IS ENSHRINED IN

217
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,681
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE FOURTH

218
00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:56,518
ESTATE HOLDS THE ESSENTIAL JOB

219
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,254
OF BEING YOUR EYES AND OFTEN

220
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,955
EARS AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, YOUR

221
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:01,256
VOICE.

222
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,124
IT'S A CORNERSTONE OF OUR

223
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,491
REPUBLIC.

224
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,560
OVER 22 YEARS AT THIS NETWORK,

225
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,961
IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE

COLLEAGUES AT COMPETITORS AT CNN

227
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:16,471

POST," "THE WASHINGTON POST,"

231

ALL OF THEM OPERATE IN THE

232
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:23,678
PUBLIC INTERESTS.

233
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,547
WE WORK TO DISCERN WHAT IS

234
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:25,847
TRUTH.

235
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,916
THEN TO PRESENT IT TO YOU IN

236
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,217
CONTEXT AND WITH PERSPECTIVE.

237
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,553

THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT

241
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:41,296
WE DO.

242
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:44,232
IT'S OUR REASON FOR BEING, OUR

243
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:44,566
PURPOSE.

244
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,366
PLEASE KNOW THIS.

245
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,569
I ACKNOWLEDGE MANY THOUSANDS OF

246
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,536

00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,772
PROTESTATIONS AND IN DOING SO, I

MISREPRESENTED THE TRUTH THOU.

00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:04,752
AND I TELL YOU AND CORRECT IT IN

255
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,221
A TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE MANNER.

256
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:09,257
AS AN ASIDE, WHEN THE PRESIDENT

257
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,229
DISCOVER THE UNDERLYING REASON

258
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,312
PURVEYORS OF TRUTH.

259
00:10:31,313 --> 00:00:00,000
