right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because government is in the hands</font>

of big lobbies that's the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's been wrong with America but</font>

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,250
now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems that we're even doing away</font>

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,899
terrifying it's exactly in the opposite

direction of where we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be heading</font>

18

we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take some longer term</font>

objectives for example making<font color="#E5E5E5"> our energy</font>

system take removing this idiotic system

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,780
where there's one trillion dollars of

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,360
student that's something completely

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,789
unheard of in any other high-income

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,340
countries in the world America became so

25-year plan to make billions that we

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> deserve they try to grab</font>

gimmicks or deregulation or tax cuts and

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,290

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,180
things are hopeless it just means we

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,830
have to get reoriented whether it's

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">health care reform or building a real</font>

40
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,420
things if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> say yeah let's really solve</font>
