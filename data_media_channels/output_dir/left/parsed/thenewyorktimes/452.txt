“I really disagreed with him.
I was not his fan.
But I'll tell you what:
What he did,
he brought back 
his reputation.”
In October, Donald Trump had
good things to say
about both James Comey
and his decision
to reopen his investigation
into Hillary Clinton's emails.
“And it took guts for Director
Comey
to make the move that he made.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions
also applauded the F.B.I.
director.
“You know, F.B.I. Director Comey
did the right thing.
When he found new evidence,
he had no choice
but to report to the American
Congress ...”
But that was then.
Now, one of the reasons why
Trump fired Comey
was over his handling of this
very same incident.
“Why now?”
When it comes to Comey,
Democrats have also done an
about face
on their feelings.
They were very critical of his
decision,
just days before the election,
to reopen the Clinton case.
“I think he made a mistake
on this.
And he clearly has a
double standard.”
“And I think it would not be a
bad thing
for the American people
if he did step down.” 
Now, some of those same people
are calling Trump's decision
to fire Comey
highly unfortunate.
“The dismissal of Director Comey
establishes a very troubling
pattern.”
Nancy Pelosi compared Comey’s
dismissal
to “some of the worst Executive
Branch abuses.”
Bernie Sanders said it raised
“serious questions”
about what Trump is hiding.
The irony of the Democrats'
shifting relationship
to James Comey was not lost
on Donald Trump.
Trump himself tweeted
that “Democrats have said some
of the worst things
about James Comey, including
the fact
that he should be fired,
but now they play so sad.”
The irony of his own shifts
was another story.
