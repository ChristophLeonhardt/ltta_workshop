1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,510
"Everyone is listening to you now.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:09,340
You came by the tens of millions to become
part of a historic movement the likes of which

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,580
the world has never seen before..."

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,789
US President Donald Trump's victory is part
of a new wave of Populism sweeping through

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,539
the democracies of the world.

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,400
What differentiates populists from mainstream
politicians is the claim that they alone represent

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
the will of the people as a whole.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,750
That allows them to dismiss any opposition
to themselves or their policies as an attack

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,980
on the popular will.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,790
Modern populists often take this approach
as they tap into the backlash against immigration

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,580
and a globalized economy that many voters who feel
left behind.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,860
Here's the situation.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,220
Unlike most ism's, populism does not lean
left, right, or even center.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,620
From the late radical socialist Hugo Chavez
in Venezuela to the far-right nationalist

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,840
Marine Le Pen in France, the uniting factor
is how they conduct politics.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,170
According to one author there are three core
requirements for politicians to be considered

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,170
populist.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,820
One: they make an appeal to the people, championing
their cause against a despised elite.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,390
"She will keep our rigged system in place.

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,280
I alone can fix it."

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,960
Populists also use crises, or manufacture
them, to justify the call to revolt.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,531
And lastly, inflammatory language is used
to shock the establishment and prove the politician's

23
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:32,510
credentials as one of the people.

24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,640
"There is a lot of moroccan scum in holland
making the streets unsafe."

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
"Mr. Obama, you can go to hell."

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
The 2008 financial crisis opened the door
for populists, as rising inequality eroded

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
trust in politicians and other powerful members
of society.

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Here's the argument.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,570
Because populists make big promises to shake
up society, they tend to bump up quickly against

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,450
democratic checks and balances, in particular
the courts and media, that are designed to

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,660
limit what governments can do.

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,220
the temptation becomes to
declare these institutions part o fan elite

33
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,340
conspiracy to block the people's will.

34
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,729
"I have a running war with the media.

35
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,439
They are among the most dishonest human beings
on Earth."

36
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,049
There is a reason why populists emerge.

37
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,080
They promise a correction for democracies
that seem to have lost their representative

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
power and they offer a fresh start.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,660
The challenge remains for mainstream politicians
to address widespread economic and cultural

40
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
fears.

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,470
Otherwise the draw of populism is not going
away anytime soon.

42
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,909
Anything is possible if enough decent people
are prepared to stand up against the establishment.

43
00:02:29,909 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you very much indeed.
