it's the human thing to feel especially

if you were in the remain camp and you

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,570
are in despair at what has happened but

to funnel them in constructive means

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,760
because if we fail to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and it's</font>

really have a responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,700
intellectually honest to take a deep

fundamentally disagree with because if

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
we go down the path of taking voting

blocs and characterizing them in a

certain way whether that be xenophobic

been xenophobic and racist or being

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,420
idealistic about an institution which

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,540
was flawed we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose our way</font>

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,000
and the character tools that we paint

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,240
are going to create even bigger divides

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,399
than what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing right now and in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the time of such volatility we can't</font>

many ways

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,250
to put focus on the power structure and

52
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,980
bring in the reforms that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

53
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,909
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> society</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for everyone because if</font>

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,579
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

55
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,040
in life it is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ruling class</font>

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,139
loved the vision because if we keep

57
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,969
fighting<font color="#E5E5E5"> among themselves they can get</font>

58
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,120
away with doing things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> benefit them</font>

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,549
and not us and we cannot lose our way

60
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,670
with that so yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to be angry</font>

61
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,519
it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be shocked and in feel</font>

62
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,889
complete and utter despair but please

63
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,620
don't lose sight of the fact that

64
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,569
regardless of how people voted there is

65
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,220
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why they got to that point in</font>

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">life and for many of those people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

67
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they were hurting they had no</font>

68
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense of ways to fight back politically</font>

69
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,900
and this was a great fu to the

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,620
establishment rightly or wrongly so use

71
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,500
that energy to organize with friends

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,799
family we can't we all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose</font>

74
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,790
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them so decide what are the</font>

75
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,260
things you care about most you know we

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about these global issues that the</font>

77
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,919
was important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for whether that was the</font>

80
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,620
your battles and use this energy to

81
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,479
fight for them keep a spotlight on the

82
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,159
power structure and don't let them off

83
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,139
the hook because if we do things are

84
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,560
only going to get worse and with the

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,419
technology we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have now to communicate</font>

86
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,209
and share ideas and actually broaden our

87
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,040
horizons of empathy I keep mentioning

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
this book in my last video with all this

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,799
potential we have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a</font>

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,900
better world despite things getting

91
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,739
worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps first and weirdly enough</font>

92
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,989
my band has just released our new EP

93
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,379
today and we've got a new music video

94
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,930
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Horror Show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wrote</font>

95
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,769
that song with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the band in October 2014</font>

96
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:15,689
and it was all about frustration with

97
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">the power structure and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that we</font>

98
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,880
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight back and there is a line</font>

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,340
in it which I feel rings very true to

100
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,169
the current situation we're in and it is

101
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,659
this

102
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:30,780
centralized power is flawed our networks

103
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,969
can reform unity too big to fail and

104
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:38,939
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in mind let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep fighting</font>

105
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:41,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a better future and just keep</font>

106

rational intellectually honest and don't

107
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,580
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear anger and hate consume you</font>

108
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,060
because if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens those in the</font>

109
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,979
power structure the one is divided will

110
00:04:52,979 --> 00:00:00,000
win thank you
