>> Martha: SO, TO TRUMP OR NOT
TO TRUMP?
THAT'S A QUESTION FOR SOME
G.O.P. CANDIDATES OUT THERE.
>> IT'S NOT THE PLACE FOR ANY
PARTY TO END UP WITH A CULTLIKE
SITUATION AS IT RELATES TO A
PRESIDENT WHO HAPPENS TO BE
PURPORTEDLY OF THE SAME PARTY.
>> LIKE MY OPPONENT SAID LAST
NIGHT, HER WORDS WERE, THIS IS
THE PARTY OF DONALD J. TRUMP.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THE PARTY
OF DONALD J. TRUMP.
>> Martha: 'S OF NOT
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT DID NOT
END UP WORKING WELL FOR MARK
SANFORD WHO YOU SAW HERE LAST
NIGHT, BUT SUPPORTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WORKING WELL
FOR SOME OTHERS INCLUDING OUR
NEXT GUEST, COREY STEWART.
HE HAS GOTTEN LOTS OF ATTENTION
FOR THIS CONTENTIOUS INTERVIEW
VIRGINIA SENATE PRIMARY.
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH ANY OF
THOSE THINGS THAT YOU SAID.
THE THING IS -- THEY ARE ALL
TRUE.
YOU ARE TRYING TO DENY YOUR PAST
BUT THEY ARE LIKE A BIG UGLY
SHADOW.
>> YOUR TRYING TO CHANGE THE
SUBJECT.
>> Martha: VERY GOOD TO HAVE
YOU HERE TONIGHT.
>> MY PLEASURE, THANKS MARTHA.
>> Martha: SO THE SUBJECT YOU
ARE ARGUING LAST NIGHT AT CNN IS
GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME UP.
WHEN YOU HAVE DEBATES, WHEN YOU
ARE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE YOU
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURSL
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURSF
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURSW
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURST
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURSI
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURSN
THE PAST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT
IN THE DAILY WIRE AND THE DAILY
STANDARD.
PAUL KNEELAND AS ONE OF THE
NAMES IN THERE AND HE HAS BEEN
HARSHLY CRITICIZED FOR
ANTI-SEMITISM.
HE ONCE CALLED HIM A HERO AND
SAID YOU WERE INSPIRED BY HIM.
YOU DISCOUNT THAT, DO YOU REJECT
THAT?
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO THAT?
>> YES, ACTUALLY I HAVE MANY
TIMES.
IS WHEN PHYLLIS SCHAAF LAY DEAD
AND NAN COULTER DID AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AS WELL, HE
SAID VERY NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM.
IT WAS ONLY AFTER THAT HE LOST
HIS MARBLES AND SAID TERRIBLE
THINGS.
THEN WE KIND OF ALL DISTANCE
OURSELVES FROM HIM.
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR CNN
AND A LEFT-WING MEDIA, THEY ARE
TRYING TO CONNECT US TO ALL
THAT.
THE REASON THEY ARE AS THEY ARE
TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM THE MAIN
MESSAGE WHICH IS PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS STRONG, GETTING STRONGER, AND
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TIED
OURSELVES TO HIM AND VOWED TO
SUPPORT HIS POLICIES ARE WINNING
SUPPORT HIS POLICIES ARE WINNIN
WINNING.
AND WE WILL INCREASINGLY WIN AS
WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER.
BY THAT POINT, WE WILL HAVE A
RED TIDE BECAUSE OF THE
POPULARITY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>> Martha: YOU MAY BE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.
ONE MORE QUESTION, BECAUSE PAUL
KNEELAND, YOU ARE RIGHT, IT WAS
REVEALED AFTER YOU SAID THOSE
THINGS THAT HE HAD ANTI-SEMITIC
COMMENTS.
HOWEVER HE HAD REVEALED THAT --
>> NOT AT ALL.
NOT EVERY PERSON YOU MEET WITH,
AND YOU MEET A LOT OF THEM IN
POLITICS.
YOU DON'T DO A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON EVERYBODY AND I CERTAINLY
WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THAT.
I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND
THE COMMUNITY ARE SERVED RIGHT
NOW.
>> Martha: SO IN TERMS OF THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN, YOU ARE INVOLVED
IN THE TRUCK CAMPAIGN, FIRED IN
2016 BUT NOW THE PRESIDENT IS
SUPPORTIVE OF YOU.
YOU WROTE       HE WROTE A VERYN
YOU WROTE       HE WROTE A VERYC
YOU WROTE       HE WROTE A VERYE
STATEMENT ABOUT YOU AND YOU HAVE
MADE IT CLEAR THAT YOU WANT TO
BE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH HIM AS
YOU MOVE FORWARD IN THIS
CAMPAIGN, CORRECT?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
HE'S HAD A TREMENDOUS STRING OF
SUCCESSES HERE.
THE TAX CUT WHICH HAS LED -- AND
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT, I'M
TELLING YOU.
YOU CAN SEE THE RESURGENCE IN
MANUFACTURING IN PARTICULAR, IN
VIRGINIA, SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
AROUND THE STATE.
AND NOW WITH THIS LATEST SUCCESS
IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA FOR THE
FIRST TIME, WE HAVE PEACE
BREAKING OUT.
SINCE 1950 IN THE KOREAN
PENINSULA, AND YOU CAN'T ARGUE
WITH THAT SUCCESS.
>> Martha: YOU WILL RUN
AGAINST TIM KAINE IN THE STATE
OF VIRGINIA AND THAT WILL BE A
VERY TOUGH RACE, IT'S ALWAYS A
TIGHT RACE IN VIRGINIA.
VERY QUICKLY BEFORE YOU GO,
WHAT'S YOUR MAIN STRATEGY, WHAT
DO YOU THINK HAS WEAKNESSES?
>> HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR SIX
YEARS AND HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
NOT A SINGLE ACCOMPLISHMENT IN
THE PAST SIX YEARS.
THE ONLY THING HE HAS DONE IS
RUN FOR VICE PRESIDENT AND HE
DIDN'T EVEN DO A GOOD JOB AT
