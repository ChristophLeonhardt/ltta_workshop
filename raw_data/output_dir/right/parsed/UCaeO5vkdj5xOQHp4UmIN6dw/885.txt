ten dead at Santa Fe High School another
13 injured the shooter is reported to
have walked into the classroom and
shouted woohoo as he sprayed bullets
although after the shooting he the
police say that he showed no emotion at
all which is the same story that we have
heard many times before
people who knew him say that they're
shocked there were no red flags seemed
like a normal guy and then this there
have been two mass shootings in our
schools in the past four months leaving
27 kids dead another 30 injured now CNN
claims that there have been 22 school
shootings in 2018 and that's not true
but what is true is still very very bad
you have to mass shootings 27 kids
killed by mass shootings in public
school in four months see that's the
whole problem with the gun control
advocates when they make up or
exaggerate mass shooting statistics
school shooting statistics the first
problem is that it's dishonest the
second problem is it's completely
unnecessary the actual statistics are
bad enough you know people are not
imagining things when they say that mass
shootings seem to be happening with a
much greater frequency these days
that's not our imagination
now people my generation we we remember
you know if you're around my age then
then then of course you have a distinct
memory of Columbine I was in middle
school when that happened
and
Columbine happened and it was like
unlike anything that we had ever seen
before
and then nothing like it happened again
for several years
but now you have a school shooting and
you say oh another one
five deadliest mass shootings in America
have all happened in the previous five
years
okay
top 5 deadliest mass shootings in
America have happened in the last 5
years two of the top five were committed
in the last 12 months 14 of the top 22
have occurred in the past 10 years the
deadliest mass shooting in American
history was in 2016 and then a new
deadliest mass shooting in America
happened in 2017
so yes it's bad
it's really really bad
whenever this happens people say well
this isn't normal the this isn't normal
but it is normal is the point
destruction and misery have been well
they've been the norm since the fall of
man but especially they've been the norm
since the last century close to 100
million people were killed by communism
let alone and then there was the
Holocaust many other genocides not to
mention two world wars two nuclear bombs
that was all in one century
now we're told that that was the
previous century that was the 20th
century 21st century is different and
what we're told is that we've entered
into the most peaceful time in human
history but the people who are making
those declarations as optimistic and
pleasing as they sound are simply
ignoring the fact that 50 million human
beings are killed by abortion worldwide
every year and that's still going on
the world's been on a pace of
approximately 50 million abortions a
year since 1990 since at least 1990
which means that we've killed 1.4
billion people
in less than 30 years that's 20% of the
world's population 20% of the world's
population has been murdered
in less than three decades
so
most peaceful time
not even close
this is what we're living in right now
is by far the most violent and
destructive and deadliest time in human
history and it's not even close
things are not getting better
that's what I'm trying to say
things are not getting better
not been getting better they're not
getting better now they won't get better
I'm sorry to tell you this
just the fact
things are getting worse in a hurry
we've simply gotten better at ignoring
how bad they are
I'm so good at it that we've got this
entire chunk of 50 million humans killed
every year and we could just completely
put that to the side like it's not even
happening we could just discount that
and then go around talking about oh it's
a peaceful time it's such a peaceful
time
I mean even the Santa Fe's shooting
which just happened on Friday by the way
seems to already be forgotten by by a
lot of people it seems like the next
morning we forgot about it and I know
the Royal Wedding had a lot to do with
that the Royal Wedding which was I mean
it's such an amazing romantic story
right of a woman ditching her husband
leaving him in a dust and then going to
marry someone who's richer so it's such
an amazing romantic story right at oh
yes it's so great we should all be
happily ever after I destroy your
marriage and go marry somebody else
fantastic so we've moved on to that and
yeah we're good at that we're good at
moving on quickly and I think we'd call
that resilience that's what we try to
call that we like to pretend no we're
we're resilient Americans are so
resilient there's a mass shooting and we
just move on it's not resilience its
indifference
and there is a difference between those
two things
now it should be noted that there's one
other conspicuous global trend that's
been happening across the world along
with all the bloodshed and the death and
destruction and murder over the last 100
years along with that there's been
another trend and that other trend is
secularism godlessness most countries in
the world have become increasingly
godless as the years have progressed the
West is seeing historic levels of
atheism and secularism to the point now
where there are some countries in Europe
that are predominantly majority
populated by unbelievers and these two
things are not a coincidence
the nightmare that we've lived since the
turn of the previous century has been
the direct result
of this it's been the direct result of
the world rejecting God we had fled from
God and we have fled out into the
wilderness and what we found out here in
the wilderness
in our freedom is evil and despair and
death on an unprecedented scale
we have become an empty country and
empty people in empty world emptiness is
the thing that kind of ties all this
together the war the shootings the
genocide everything abortion ties it all
together because there's this void
that's left behind when you push God out
and as a world as a world we have pushed
God out
and we've left this giant gaping hole
and now we're struggling and fumbling to
fill it with something these school
shooters on an individual level you know
they they have this emptiness this hole
inside them they try to fill it with
something usually they turn to media and
video games this is yet another school
shooter it was an avid video game player
but I know we're not going to talk about
that it's completely totally absolutely
unrelated it's got two things of nothing
to do with one another at all of course
because as part of our emptiness we are
so desperate to justify all of our
entertainment choices it's the only
thing we care about is just making sure
that nobody questions our entertainment
so if anyone mentions oh no we can't
talk about that that's my entertainment
how dare you now that's gonna make me
angry if you question my entertainment
the school shootings they don't really
make me that eager but if you question
my entertainment that'll make me angry
Matt
you
so these school shooters they they look
for something to fill the void and what
they find is not satisfying enough
usually it exasperates the problem
and so finally they explode after they
get tired of wallowing in their numbness
and their indifference they explode in
this ball of rage and destruction and as
I've said now many times I think the
main thing that they're doing why they
do this and there might be other
individual motivations we hear about
with this kid apparently had a grudge
against at least one of the girls in the
school he was rejected by her you know
ever every high school in America is
filled with boys that are rejected by
girls it's it's like the main thing that
happens to high school boys yet most of
them don't go down that path so why did
he choose that path and I think mainly
it's because of that emptiness inside
him and what he was really doing what
these school shooters mass shooters what
they're all really trying to do is
they're trying to feel something they're
trying to feel control you know they
want control over life over just this
mysterious empty thing
and that's the trajectory that the
entire human race has basically been
following
and it can't lead anywhere except
ruination
you
you know we really need a Jeremiah you
know we we need a an Old Testament like
prophet type of person in this day and
age
because in the Old Testament times they
had guys like Jeremiah they had the
profits to come and say to them listen
you idiots do you understand why this is
happening do you understand what all
these bad things are happening because
you've rejected God
and oftentimes they would put it just
like that pretty much using their own
language but
just smacking people upside the head pay
attention look around you
don't act so surprised
you reject God you want to live your
your lives of sin and you're surprised
when this stuff happens don't be
surprised
you
we need something like that in our day
because
because what we really need
the only solution is a mass spiritual
revival and a collective return to faith
no other solution will solve anything
everything else is just kind of
reshuffling the problem
rebranding it and that's been our so
that has been our solution for the last
100 years or so is to take a problem and
just rebrand it and call it something
else so we took the genocides of the
20th century and we rebranded them we
put them in a clinic we call them
abortion now and now we say oh there's
no more genocides we solved the problem
array so what's going to be our
rebranding solution for school shootings
I don't know
there is no solution other than
returning to God
all of us
you know stupid arrogant people
stupid arrogant
foolish people like to laugh at the idea
of thoughts and prayers in the wake of
tragedy
but thoughts and prayers really could
save us they could
if we really had our thoughts on God
and if we really had our knees on the
ground and unceasing prayer things would
not be like this
a pious prayerful country does not kill
its own kids whether in the classroom or
the womb
so yes thoughts and prayers could change
everything
and please don't come in and say well
yes Matt we need thoughts and prayers
but also action
if you say that that I'm gonna have to
suspect that you've never prayed because
you don't understand it's not necessary
to stipulate thoughts and prayers and
action if you have a deep prayer life
and your mind is focused on God then of
course you're acting action is a natural
is it is a natural conclusion that flows
from that foundation it's almost
impossible for a prayerful spiritual
humble man or woman not to act it's
almost impossible
because a person like that has so much
grace pouring into them as a result of
their connection with God that to resist
it and not to act would require much
more effort than to simply act so those
who do not act do not pray it's just
like within your own family you know if
you're praying every day for the
spiritual and physical protection of
your own children which I certainly hope
that we all are but if you do of course
you're also taking practical steps to
protect them because that's part of the
result of the prayer and you're taking
the right steps because God is showing
you the right steps and you're doing the
right thing rather than not praying
about it and just trying to randomly
arbitrarily do things to protect your
kids when you pray first and that's the
beginning in the foundation then the
actions follow that and they're the
correct actions not just random
arbitrary actions
so the problem is not that people are
relying too much on prayer and not
enough on practical steps the problem is
the opposite we rely entirely on
so-called practical steps and we don't
rely at all on God we don't even factor
him in
so what not what I'm saying what I'll
say again is that if everyone in the
nation had their thoughts on God and
their knees on the ground in prayer
things would get better
guaranteed absolutely
I know that for certain our affliction
is spiritual we are a nation that is
falling more and more into the clutches
of evil and Satan and away from God and
we are still too stubborn to cry out to
God to save us so instead we cry out to
the government and doctors and
psychologists and the law and policy and
pills and the media and Hollywood and
ourselves we cry out to all of them to
save us and none of them can and we look
everywhere but up where the answer
actually lies
the key is to pray to God unceasingly to
seek his help
and to act in accordance with him
to trust in our actions alone
but the trust in God and to act in faith
and to go to God and say what are we
supposed to do what do you want us to do
and then whatever his answer is you do
it
people who don't understand prayer and
don't have faith in it it's because they
don't do it
but if you actually pray in people who
actually pray unceasingly pray you know
they have oh they have a deep prayer
life they know
they know the
they pray consistently over a certain
problem answers will prevent present
themselves and if they go to God
consistently and say God what do you
want me to do about this or that problem
an answer will come to them it will will
100% we'll God works miracles
but we have to pray
you know think about the story of
Dunkirk the store the part of the story
that the movie Dunkirk which is a movie
that I really liked but
the movie Dunkirk leaves this out but
you know we know about the movie shows
us how the Citizen Navy was mobilized to
rescue the Allied forces from the beach
what they leave out is that a Day of
Prayer was called across the country and
the British people poured into churches
and they prayed together in Mass they
prayed for a miracle and they received
it mysteriously Hitler ordered his his
troops to halt when he couldn't easily
destroyed the Allies then there was bad
weather that grounded German planes but
then the weather was miraculous II was
good when that when the when the British
needed it to be so so they'd get their
men off the beach the people prayed and
they acted Anna miracle occurred
and it's very possible that that miracle
not only saved those men but saved
Western civilization
works miracles he's been doing it since
the dawn of time the dawn of time itself
was a miracle a supernatural act that
made possible all things so God works
miracles but we have to ask for them and
we have to come to him we have to humble
ourselves and pray all of us
can God stop mass shootings yes Ken he
stopped Hitler
he's healed the blind
toward the lame raised the dead he
parted the Seas he brought forth water
from a rock brought manna down from
heaven he he brought himself down from
heaven rescued us from sin so yes he
could stop mass shootings he can do
anything
we have to pray and have faith
and I'm speaking now I'm speaking now
specifically to those who believe to
those who believe not and that or at
least claim to believin that's what 80%
of the country or more claims to believe
in God
I know this message to people who don't
believe in God to people who are atheist
who are completely secular who reject
God they hear this conversation and they
laugh and they snicker about it I'm not
talking to them okay they they they are
I'm tuning them out for right now
it's not possible for me to talk about
the power of prayer to to to atheists on
the internet because they will just
laugh like children about it and so
right now I'm not talking to them
I'm talking to people who actually
pretend to believe okay you and I those
who are left we say we believe
so why aren't we turning to God
it's only through his grace that we do
believe in the first place
so what do you think God's gonna say to
us in the end if we took all this grace
that he gave us and we wasted it
he gives us this grace for a reason
so why are we acknowledging his presence
through his grace and then just leaving
it at that like okay there you are God
and then just continuing about our days
in a way where that fact has no bearing
whatsoever on our lives on how we
operate on what we do on how we think
it
we are in for a rude awakening
if everything that's been happening
around the world for the last 100 or
more years if that isn't enough to wake
us up and to make us turn back to God
even though we claimed already believe
in him if this isn't enough to make us
cling to him desperately and to turn to
him and have faith in him and to seek
his help if this isn't enough
then I think when we die we're in fray
a rough time
put it like that
so that's the solution
you
it's just that masked spiritual revival
you know it's as simple as that which I
know is probably not going to happen
but it's the only solution
and it's anywhere else we looked any
other solution will be a failure so this
is it
so let's start praying for that let's
start there
thanks for watching everybody and
Godspeed
you
you
