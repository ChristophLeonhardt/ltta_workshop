we've been following these lies drip drip drip but today feels like a fire hose because there's also this the plaintiffs in a lawsuit accusing President Trump of accepting unconstitutional gifts from foreign interests are hailing progress in their case a federal district court judge is letting their case advanced though it's been limited only to payments involving the Trump International Hotel in Washington the suit was filed by Washington DC and the state of Maryland accusing the president of violating the Constitution's anti-corruption clauses last night the Trump Hotel near the White House was hit with a light projection reading this crime scene do not enter toys vans as we as we've said before on this show the President of the United States from his first week or two in office actually declared war on the federal judiciary has talked about Republican judges and said that those Republican judges in Washington State that were you know questioned whether they actually had authority or not and we're seeing judges strike back time and time again how big of a deal is is this ruling that that we actually can start to have a have hearings and have inquiries into whether the president is violating the emoluments clause this ruling is a big deal this is the first of the emoluments Clause cases that's been able to move forward and even though it's limited solely to the claims about Trump Tower those claims may be very powerful because what they involve are allegations by other hotel owners that their business has dropped off while the president is making a lot of money based on the fact that people who want a curry favor with him are able to do that by going to his hotel and spending their money there and those claims are very powerful frankly and I think the interesting aspect of this as you point out is the reaction of the federal judiciary my expectation is that they will take their room the president for all of his comments against them by acting with a very high level of integrity by scrupulously reviewing the claims and by acting consistently with the law in all regards by upholding the integrity of the judicial branch they'll in essence be delivering a very loud response to the president as judges across this country have been doing Steve Rattner if you look at what the president's been doing not only in Washington DC but also down in Mora Lago you have a lot of groups you you read the work of the Washington Post's Pulitzer prize-winning reporter David Farenthold and you see all of the established organizations that have fled mora Lago because they don't want to be tainted with with with Donald Trump's reputation and yet you see a lot of people that have gone in who would try to curry favor with the president that of course happening in more Lago but also having a great deal in his Washington DC property look it's quite extraordinary on many levels first of all there's this whole amount emoluments thing where he's were mar-a-lago and Trump International have become become the swamp for lack of a better word we're all the swamp denizens come to see Trump and Trump profits but because I'll spend a lot of money there and then you have characters like Elliott Brody who the times has been writing about for the last few days who's basically used his position as finance chair of the Republican National Committee to engage and what you couldn't call anything other than influence peddling with all these really sleazy foreign governments where he goes there and he says I can get you in to see Trump or somebody senior on the hill and you pay me several million dollars for it and so on and so forth and so one of the ironies about this whole thing that has struck me is that a guy who came here saying he was going to drain the swamp has actually brought the swamp in in greater and depth and at least I've ever seen it around Washington before yes Steve Schmidt are Michael Schmidt and Michael Smith he really has brought this swamp to Washington DC and I got to believe in the coming months we're going to see in a the unemployment rate even possibly drop down into possibly the high threes but of all of the Washington lawyers that are going to have jobs just based on the news that we've reported the first 20 minutes of the show it really seriously it really is remarkable is it not the number of legal challenges that continue to explode and possibly take down this administration yeah but at the heart of the problem is that the president can't seem to find lawyers himself to represent him he really just has one personal lawyer working on this Jay Sekulow working on the Muller part of this and that he has tried in the past few weeks to go out and get a top lawyer someone who is a former federal prosecutor that has deep experience dealing with complex Criminal Investigations just like this one and time after time the firm's for these lawyers are saying we cannot do this this is too controversial of an issue for us to get involved with our employees would go nuts if we were to represent Donald Trump and we cannot allow our partners to work on this the president continues to search for more lawyers they say that they'll have some soon but at the end of the day it's just Jay Sekulow for now someone whose expertise is not necessarily dealing with someone directly like Bob Muller yeah and you know mica if you are an attorney in Washington DC and you specialize in in the sort of law that Donald Trump is it needs a lawyer badly and are you're a former federal prosecutor and you think there's a possibility that you would be part of a legal team that would be firing Bob Muller then you you understand that being a part of Donald Trump's legal team at that point would literally or figuratively put the mark of cain on your forehead for the rest of your life in Washington DC your ability to get a job in the future would be wiped clean because there are a few attorneys few former federal prosecutors few former directors that they carry more respect than Robert Muller the third does and the president just is not going to find any attorneys that will ever put themselves in that position Michael Schmidt thank you so much for your reporting this morning Jonathan Turley Joyce fans thank you for your analysis lot still to get to here on Morning Joe we're gonna break down yet another
