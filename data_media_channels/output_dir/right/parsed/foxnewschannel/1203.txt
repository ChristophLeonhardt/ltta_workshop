AND ALWAYS WORKING TO BE BETTER.
ROB: ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK,
ONE WEEK OUT FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S POTENTIALLY HISTORIC
SIT-DOWN WITH KIM JONG UN.
NOW SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR
AL-ASSAD WANTS HIS OWN FACE TO
FACE WITH KIM JONG UN.
QUOTE, I'M GOING TO VISIT THE
DPRK AND MEET KIM JONG UN.
JILLIAN: DESPITE CLAIMS NO
INDICATIONS THAT ANY PLANS HAVE
BEEN MADE.
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT NORTH
KOREA IS COURTING OTHER HEADS OF
STATES WHILE PLANNING A SUMMIT
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HERE NOW TO WEIGH IN IS THE
AUTHOR OF DEAR, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THE LATEST NEWS.
>> ON THE ONE HAND THIS COULD BE
PLATITUDE AND THE OTHER THING
WHY IS DOES THE U.S. GET TO BE
ARM'S DEALER AND THEY DON'T.
ALL THE MISSILE TESTS ARE GREAT
COMMERCIAL FOR PRODUCTS AND
SMALL STATE CAN STAND UP TO U.S.
AND OTHER NATIONS, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT WILL COMPENSATE
FOR.
THEY WILL DIAL DOWN MISSILES AN
WEAPON'S INDUSTRIES, THEY WILL
WANT MONEY OR SOMETHING ELSE IN
EXCHANGE AND SYRIA WOULD BE ONE
OF THE CUSTOMERS.
ROB: TWO VERY BAD PEOPLE MEETING
TOGETHER.
BIG-TIME THREAT TO, I THINK,
INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE TWO
MEETING AND BIG THREAT, I THINK,
TO OUR NEGOTIATIONS HERE.
ARE WE FOOLS TO GO INTO THIS
MEETING AT THIS POINT KNOWING
THAT THEY WILL MEET, THIS DOES
SEEM LIKE BAD NEWS.
>> WE CAN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING
THAT THE NORTH KOREAN PROPAGANDA
SAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE QUOTING
ASSAD SAYING THEY WILL VISIT
WITH KIM JONG UN IN THE FUTURE
DOESN'T MEAN HE HAS GOTTEN
FLIGHT YET, THERE'S ONLY ONE TO
FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG, IT'S BEEN
ONE.
JILLIAN: YOU STILL THINK WE
SHOULD HAVE SUMMIT, DOES IT
PERHAPS CHANGE THE APPROACH?
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
VERY WELL AWARE AND ALL THE
PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE ARE
AWARE OF THE NATURE OF NORTH
KOREANS.
THIS IS NOT MEETING WITH THERESA
MAY OR ANGELA MERKEL, HAVE NO
PROBLEM KEEPING FOOD AWAY FROM
PEOPLE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
POWER IN COST.
ROB: VLADIMIR PUTIN AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP POTENTIALLY
MEETING TOGETHER, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT?
>> PROBABLY THE RUSSIAN
MENTALITY IF YOUR RIVALS ARE
DOING WELL, YOU WILL DO ANYTHING
THAT YOU CAN.
RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER MET
WITH KIM JONG UN EARLIER THIS
WEEK.
NO DOUBT THEY DISCUSSED UPCOMING
SUMMIT AND ISSUES WITH AMERICA.
I CAN SEE PUTIN COZING UP TO KIM
JONG UN AS HE HAS DONE TO OTHER
PLACES IN THE WORLD SIMPLY AS
METH TO UNDERMINING PRESIDENT
TRUMP AS HE TRIED TO UNDERMINE
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
JILLIAN: HE SPOKE ABOUT THIS AND
WE WILL HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO
SAY ON THE OTHER SIDE.
>> AS IT RELATES TO ANY
POTENTIAL MEETING IT WOULD BE A
WAYS OFF BUT I THINK THE
PRESIDENT HAS STATED BEFORE THAT
HE WOULD LIKE TO GET TOGETHER
WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN AT SOME
POINT AND SOLVE SOME OF THE
ISSUES BETWEEN THEM AND THE
PRESIDENT IS SHREWD ENOUGH WHERE
HE WOULD NOT SIT DOWN WITH
PRESIDENT PUTIN UNLESS HE HAD
ISSUES THAT SERVED THE NATION.
>> I THINK HE HAS GREAT INSIDE,
AMBASSADOR OF CHINA FOR QUITE A
WHILE.
HE HAS MIND SET OF RUSSIAN AN
CHINESE AND HE WAS NO TRUMP FAN.
IF HE'S BEHIND THE PRESIDENT,
IT'S FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.
ROB: IS IT THAT YOU CAN HAVE
NORTH KOREA, SYRIA ALLIANCE AND
CHINA BEHIND THEM AND THIS COULD
END UP IN WORLD WAR?
>> WHAT DO WE HAVE THE TO DO
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, NORTH
KOREA HAS NOT BEEN GOOD AT
MAKING ALLIANCES AND, IN FACT,
KIM JONG UN'S ATTEMPTS TO COURT
OTHER COUNTRIES IS A BREAK FROM
THE PAST.
JILLIAN: WHAT'S YOUR CONCERN?
>> NORTH KOREAN POPULATION WILL
