it's the world's most watched sporting event but is the football World Cup truly a global spectacle 32 teams will compete at russia 2018 but the number of teams are not spread out equally among regions FIFA has decided however to increase the tournament 48 teams by 2026 that's 16 more countries some of which probably will never have dreamt to participate in a World Cup will have the chance but will an expanded World Cup make things more balanced let's see right now Europe has the most guaranteed spots and although South America has about five times fewer teams in Africa in qualifying both get the same number of secure places then the remaining two spots are decided by continental playoffs under theses current plan all the continent Confederations gain spots once the World Cup is expanded but Europe and South America would still have disproportionally high quotas compared to the rest both continents have the most successful teams every work of winner has come from them so surely giving them more of a platform will mean a better quality tournament right well not necessarily in the last World Cup 7 of Europe's 13 teams were eliminated in the first round while Africa at two out of five teams go through so percentage-wise both had pretty similar success rates of making the second round Africa 40 percent and Europe 46 percent so maybe if there was a more equal spread of teams we'd see more non European and South American sides getting further in the competition - how the Europe and South America gets such a disproportional footprint on the World Cup anyway you have to go back to the first two tournaments to understand the first edition was in 1930 in Uruguay it only featured teams from Europe and the Americas at the time they had the most developed footballing infrastructures but after world war ii and the collapse of colonial empires most countries from Africa and Asia started applying for entry however that didn't trigger an instant upsurge in slots wife just like at the United Nations where certain countries have a veto power and sharing that in a place in global power play is always assured FIFA is locked that's much different historically certain countries who will call them so the founding fathers of of FIFA have had a say in the biggest and the major decisions so with FIFA actually committed to leveling out the playing field well there are criticisms that expanding the World Cup isn't really about that thesis current president Gianni Infantino is set to have other motives we all know that there's another reason and it's this money and you know 48 team World Cup is going to generate a lot more income it will make the president's positions like we've got an election coming up next year in 2019 anything infantino can do to kind of weave his magic I could put it so that will make a big difference in terms of whether he's really elected in 2019 the makeup of the World Cup now and even once its expanded might not please everyone by the very least with billions around the world expected to tune in for the month-long tournament there can be little doubt about its global appeal you
