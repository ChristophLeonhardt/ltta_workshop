of scoff at what it means to be a

inspirational quotes my girl I feel it

48
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,700
especially women on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube because of</font>

49
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,530
the pervasive culture that we have and

I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking a lot about the</font>

pervasive cultures that we embody this

52
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,800
is part of like rape culture or

53
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,230
patriarchy and that we emboldened men to

54
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,060
believe it they have an ownership over

55
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,910
women and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for this guy to be that</font>

60
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,810
take her life away then we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

61
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,640
shooting or the massacre that happened

at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Orlando nightclub pulse if it's a</font>

63
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,480
gay club and just so many feel I mean

gay friend its I mean it doesn't again I

66
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,870
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to iterate that as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I like</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order for me to feel</font>

69

some type way about the situation you

70
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,860
know but I really did immediately think

71
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,780
about all the times in New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City</font>

72
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,030
like that I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pride or that i went</font>

73
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the gay club with my homeboys and</font>

74
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,620
like how easy it would be for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

75
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> situation and lose my life and</font>

76
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,200
then how little we think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,810
safety of others right of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> safety of</font>

78
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,190
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't necessarily fit into</font>

79
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,860
the mainstream ideals in that they're

80
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,280
not sis they're not heterosexual they're

81
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">not male and white essentially</font>

82
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,120
disheartening to know that we live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

83
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,519
society where people feel like they have

84
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,549
the privilege of living over you they

85
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,860
are life is more valuable than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

86
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,160
person and that there's some higher

87
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,310
being that says so I don't believe

88
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,290
that's the principle of what any guy

89
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,660
teaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that people will twist those</font>

90
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,989
words in order to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so is really</font>

91
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sad or</font>

92
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,560
disheartening or tragic is right to

93
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,520
describe what happened in our land

94
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,230
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is definitely another pervasive</font>

95
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,090
aspect of culture that we endorse in

96
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,670
America in them homophobia is rancid in

97
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,800
our communities and this is gonna be

98
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> once approach because</font>

99
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,820
you know I know us black women so we

100

<font color="#E5E5E5">to give the strong side I anybody can</font>

102
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,150
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us about ourselves but what I saw</font>

103
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,650
after the shooting when people were

104
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,930
posting their statuses and however they

105
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,550
were acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime somebody mentioned</font>

106
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,460
homophobia without fail there was a

107
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,640
black woman in the comments section

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,170
saying oh it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fair to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that the</font>

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,769
posted a status about you know what's

111
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">really damning is that somebody found</font>

112
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,269
out their child was gay because they

113
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,160
were at this nightclub when the massacre

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,020
happened so like the child lost their

115
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,790
lives and they're finding out about

116
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,700
their child's sexuality because that

117
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,100
child didn't feel comfortable enough to

118
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,080
live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their truth but they didn't live</font>

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,430
in a society that would accept them as

120
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,560
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our women in the</font>

black<font color="#E5E5E5"> women in the comment section well</font>

123
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,710
I know gave me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit it because they</font>

124
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,540
just didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> family</font>

125
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,360
that burden that is argument with my

<font color="#E5E5E5">homegirls in Houston last year when</font>

131
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,310
it's too deep because we don't want to

132
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,930
be accused of ever being oppressed

133
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,760
because we are a very oppressed sect

134
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,500
ourselves does it feel good to talk

141
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,350
ever do your research I don't this is an

142
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,480
idea especially for gay men that they

143
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,610
have about us loving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the culture but not</font>

144
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,230
loving them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's hard to hear</font>

147
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,600
it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay why are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to like it's a struggle awards</font>

149
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,210
again yeah that's all strive to be

150
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,100
better people all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,950
you don't take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

152
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,430
ironic that after a massacre and even

153
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,380

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,120
up a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> gun laws that you need to</font>

158
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">be passed right after massacre and then</font>

159
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,460
it kind of fizzles away right and I

160
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,800
really do believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our apathy is</font>

161
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,400
what's killing us whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

162
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,360
when we start talking about rights for

163
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,570
non-binary people we ignore oh I stand

164
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,340
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversation you start</font>

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about transgenders in the</font>

166

rights are gay<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these things</font>

168
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we don't necessarily understand her</font>

169
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,420
we wouldn't personally indulge in and

170
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,340
rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> than kind of understanding what</font>

171
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,810
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to give a person that</font>

172
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,520
right over<font color="#E5E5E5"> their body we just cut it</font>

175
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,580
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> advocate for it but that we allow the</font>

176
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,970
hate-mongering to continue we don't we

177
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,600
don't correct or tell the people when

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,580
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong about their hate speech</font>

179
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,490
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't apply to us and you just</font>

never<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who's going to act on that</font>

181
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,170
hey it's like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dude who shot the</font>

184
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,810
see some punishment for it you know

185
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,490
knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that her husband was plotting</font>

186
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,710
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like how</font>

187
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us participate in some level of</font>

188
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,370
this and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just lucky enough that</font>

189
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:15,060
the person isn't act on it girl sip on

190
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,950
it cuz we all do myself included

191
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,080
so Democrats launched a filibuster on

192
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,809
the floor it lasted 15 hours in the end

193
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:30,460
after Republicans to say that they would

194
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">consider a gun law Obama has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

195
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bend the ar-15 an assault rifle that</font>

196
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,460
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented for war it wasn't meant for</font>

197
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,469
commercial consumption but it is

198
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,569
literally easier to get an ar-15 than it

199
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,089
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your driver's license and I'm</font>

200
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:47,469
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here for the facebook comment</font>

201
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:51,069
to these backwards as oh my gosh thanks

202
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,569

00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,219
our country is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> people really revel</font>

204
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,659
in hate you know it is this interesting

205
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,360
concept that we are so social media

206
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,999
amplifies a lot of voices and a lot of

207
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:03,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">us choose to use our voices towards</font>

208
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,080
negativity because to be contrarian

209
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,389
means that we think differently than

210
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,339
somebody else and somehow even when

211
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,139
you're different thought is<font color="#CCCCCC"> steep</font>

212
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,149
negativity it makes you feel important

213
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,639
again I'm pointing out things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I am</font>

214
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,349
NOT above I have been guilty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

215
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,719
same things myself but it's coming to

216
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:20,979
the recognition of how much we kind of

217
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:23,110
play into that lastly by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Orlando it's</font>

00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:43,208
that was the end of his life and that is

honestly it is sad but it's also super

278
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,820
all inspiring to look back at what

279
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,220
Muhammad Ali's legacy needs to such a

280
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,000
