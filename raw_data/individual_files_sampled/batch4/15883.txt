oh I see in the newspaper today the Calgary Herald that the Manning Center is closing its doors they've waived laid off most of their staff they're putting at least part of their building up for lease basically shutting down everything except their conferences and it wouldn't surprise me if that happens too and I can't help but think that it comes from Preston Manning's unconservative decision to support a carbon tax or a carbon levy as he told liberals to call it to sneak its way through conservatives and never did stink its way through conservatives it was tough enough selling a carbon tax when Alberta was booming but now that it's economically hurting from a carbon tax well that's just poison it's strange to me why any conservative thought that would be a saleable position but until quite recently it was the fashionable thing to say Green conservatism was supposedly a thing well then this man was elected the leader of Ontario's Conservatives and became premier take a look at Doug Ford just letting her rip on a carbon tax today I want to confirm not in Ontario the carbon taxes days are numbered in fact upon the swearing-in of my new cabinet at the top of our agenda the very first item will be to pass an order to cancel the liberal cap-and-trade carbon tax as of June the 29th the cap-and-trade the carbon tax they're gone they're done well I used to like Doug Ford but now I got to say folks it's love joining us now via Skype is our friend Brad roast a federal Conservative MP for the Riding of Saskatoon University he joins us now via Skype right great to see you again you've been a longtime opponent of the carbon tax for a variety of reasons political economic you're a scientist by background tell me what you think of this pendulum swinging back so boldly I mean I think six months ago the carbon tax felt like a done deal now I wouldn't bet on it at all I think it's a good I think the one of the best things is when you listen to Ontario as they've repealed that more and more news stories are coming out about how the real purpose of the cap-and-trade carbon tax they had in Ontario was just to spend and buy money and buy votes and we're hearing one story after another at various groups that got money from this tax grab this tax grab on consumers wallets and they're complaining now that the taps are being turned off so I'm quite optimistic a lot of voters suspected it was just a cash grab moralistic lee sold to them to make them feel good about turning over their money but with Ontario offside I'm pretty optimistic that Manitoba and a couple other provinces may rethink their positions yeah it's interesting to me to watch Catherine McKenna the global warming minister squawk about it her chief complaints about Ontario stopping the carbon tax in the cap and trade are all her crony capitalists insider friends who now won't be giving getting subsidies for wind and solar and other schemes that have no economic value in them other than they are rent seeking and termina Kannamma stood use for basically asking for Hana it's very bizarre to me that her counterpunch to Doug Ford is on these elite business people not getting their you know six or seven figure dollar subsidy it really reveals it just to be a slush fund for insiders that's how it looks to me well the carbon tax often ends up being a tax on the poor to subsidize the rich it's interesting to listen to the progressives always talk about how they're in favor of the poor well they make the poor poor and that's why they talk about then spending the money because they've taken it away in the first place so it's it's fascinating to watch it's one of the reasons I think you're increasingly seen places not just like North America but overseas as well working-class voters are really fed up with the left and are voting for someone who's actually going to defend their jobs and actually defend their pocketbooks you know if you want to work for a living you have to spend energy and to produce goods you need fuel yeah you know it was I thought it would be impossible to stop a carbon tax once it gets momentum but Australia proved it was to Saskatchewan where you're an MP from has always been against the carbon tax both under Brad wall and under the new premier but I'm looking around the country and Alberta obviously will be anti carbon tax when Jason Kenney Supreme you next year we see Doug for just all systems go we see now that New Brunswick is trying to tell Trudeau well we've already got a carbon tax is called a gasoline tax so we're done thanks very much we don't need another one it's a Prince Edward Island there they're saying they're only going to tax industrial emitters and that being a tiny province really no bigger than the University I went to they only have one industrial emitters called cavernous farms I'll probably get a grant so everyone is slowly backing away from the disaster that is the Trudeau carbon tax I really think if I had to bet I think the things gonna be stopped I mean when you've got liberals like New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island that are like liberal forever saying no thanks they're obviously not scared anymore I mean when Trudeau was new and fresh and and high in the polls he was scary to those liberal premiers I don't think they're scared anymore am I wrong well I think you're absolutely right I'm out here in Newfoundland this week talking to voters not just about this issue but other issues and I don't hear anyone going around saying the price of gasoline is too low make it 2 bucks a leader that just doesn't that isn't something that you hear I drove up to a community two and a half hours outside of the city here last night to talk to some people and it costs money if you're a fisherman in Newfoundland it is expensive to fuel your boats to drive to and from where you need to go to live people just can't afford this and n turkey is one of the inputs to life it's not like an income tax it's money after that you've produced income tax is bad enough but the carbon tax takes your money before you even earn income and that's what makes it even harder for people to deal with and just about anything else yeah well I'm sure I'm optimistic about it and when it was just a scam when I thought geez I love Saskatchewan but there are smallish province just just over a million folks that's a the and it's forgotten country for the mainstream media which based in Toronto but I feel like the battle is being joined and let me credit you as one of the Saskatchewan Knights who's been fighting against us since the first day thank you for holding the line until reinforcements have arrived I think we're gonna win this one Brad it's great to talk to you again good to see you and keep up the
