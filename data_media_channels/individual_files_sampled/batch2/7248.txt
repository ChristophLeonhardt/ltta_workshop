in 1965 Dow AgroSciences bought a pesticide and they brought it to the market called Club pyro foes they put it on the market the pesticide became widely used on crops all over the world due to how effective was it killing mosquitoes and ants and roaches and other insects that pose a threat to the global food supply 52 years after that it was that it was first introduced the pesticide is used in more than a hundred countries around the globe on more than 50 different kinds of commercial crops for example if you live in the United States and you've eaten an apple or lettuce or peaches or oranges or bananas or potatoes in the last 50 years chances are you've eaten food that has been sprayed with this chemical the EPA estimates that between 1987 and 1998 about 21 million pounds of this pesticide were used annually in the US by 2007 chlorpyrifos is the most commonly used organophosphate pesticide in the United States with an estimated 8 to 11 million pounds applied to our food into non-residential turf like golf courses like most pesticides chlorpyrifos is a neurotoxin that disrupts the normal function of the nervous system and insects and leads to death but as years of scientific research is now telling us this dangerous pesticide can also act as a neurotoxin in human beings even though Dow Chemical claims that their pesticide is completely harmless to human beings at normal doses science tells us that exposure can cause very serious and permanent damage to the nervous system of people who are exposed experimental animal studies suggest that infants and children are more susceptible than adults to the effects from low dose exposure because they have a decreased capacity to talk the to detoxify this results in disruption in the nervous system the developmental process exposure by pregnant women or infants can lead to impaired brain development resulting in a lifetime of hardships these are developmental injuries that can't be overcome or corrected once brain development is impaired the damage is permanent among adults applicators of the pesticide on farms were noted to have a far higher incidence of lung cancer than the population as well as among the population of farmers that use other forms of pest control they're also far more likely to develop a condition called wheeze which occurs when the airway becomes restricted after repeated long-term exposure to even the allegedly safe level of the pesticide the real question comes down to this is there any real safe level for this pesticide and the answer we're only going to find out after hundreds of more people die from the use of this product but the truth is this is an EPA that's going to get fully behind this chemical it's an administration that's going to let Scott Pruett do what he wants to do in allowing this chemical to be sprayed all over our bodies before it's all over
