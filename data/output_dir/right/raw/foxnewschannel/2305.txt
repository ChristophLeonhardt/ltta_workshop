KELLYANNE ON YOUR SHOW.

18
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,064
ALL SHE DOES IS LIE.

STRUCK.

23
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:38,106
I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LIDIA.

24
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:40,475
PETE: OKAY, WELL, FELLOW

25
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,876
COMEDIAN IS THE WRITER AND

26
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,511
PRODUCER BEHIND KEVIN CAN WAIT.

27
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,346
HE JOINS US NOW TO REACT.

28
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:46,681

PETE: YOU'RE THE RIGHT GUY TO

31
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:49,717
TALK TO.

32
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,453
YOU KNOW HOW TO WRITE JOKES AND

33
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:52,187
DELIVER THEM.

34
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,522
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF LAST NIGHT?

35
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:55,857
>>  IT WAS HORRIBLE.

36
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:57,792
IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT UP HORRIBLE

37
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,461
THE WHOLE ROASTING HAS GOTTEN

38
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:00,328
OUT OF HAND.

39
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,564
IT'S NOT A GENTLE, YOU KNOW, HEY

40
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:03,598
WE'RE BOTH IN THE SAME BUSINESS

41
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,433
I'M KIND OF MAKING FUN OF YOU.

42
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,068
IT'S LIKE THE PERSONAL ATTACKS,

43
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,903
IT'S VICIOUS, IT'S NOT FUN.

44
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,638
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

45
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,040
I DON'T KNOW WHO BLAMES TRUMP

46
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,974
FOR NOT GOING?

47
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:13,675
I DON'T.

48
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,577
IT'S LIKE BEING INVITED TO A

49
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:16,744
RESTAURANT WHERE YOU KNOW YOU'RE

50
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,413
GOING TO GET FOOD POISONING YOU

51
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:19,013
KNOW IT.

52
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:19,914
WHY WOULD YOU GO?

53
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,049
ABBY: DO YOU THINK THIS SPEAKS

54
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,383
TO A BROADER PROBLEM WE'RE SEE

55
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,052
ING WITH COMEDY TODAY?

56
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:26,154
ROB SCHNEIDER WHO I'M SURE YOU

57
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:31,893
KNOW IS AN SNL ALUM, AND HE SAYS

58
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:32,694
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE IS RUINING

59
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:35,029
THE JOKE, HE SAYS THE FUN OF SNL

60
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,865
WAS ALWAYS YOU NEVER KNEW

61
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,500
WHICH WAY THEY LEANED AND YOU

62
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,401
KIND OF ASSUMED THEY WOULD LIEN

63
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,070
LEFT AND LIBERAL BUT NOW THE CAT

64
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,838
IS OUT OF THE BAG AND THEY ARE

65
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:44,839
COMPLETELY AGAINST TRUMP WHICH

66
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,640
MAKES IT LESS INTERESTING

67
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,774
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION

68
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,010
THE PIECE IS GOING AND IT IS SO

69
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,745
PREDICTABLE TO HIS POINT, DO YOU

70
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:51,779
AGREE WITH THAT?

71
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,916
>>  I AGREE WITH IT 110%.

72
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,085
I DON'T KNOW ROB.

73
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:58,319
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING THE

74
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,921
SAME JOKE OVER AND OVER AND OVER

75
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:00,255
AGAIN.

76
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,990
THERE'S ZERO SURPRISE.

77
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,226
LEAVE IT TO THE WRITERS OF SNL

78
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,261
TO LIKE RUIN A KNOCK-KNOCK

79
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:06,561
JOKE.

80
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,562
LIKE KNOCK-KNOCK, WHOSE THERE?

81
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:09,931
ALEC BALDWIN AND HE HATES TRUMP.

82
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,766
IT'S THE SAME THING.

83
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:17,739
IT'S JUST PREDICTABLE.

84
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,974
MAN DID A SKIT WHERE HE WAS

85
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,676
RONALD REGAN AND HE PORTRAYED

86
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:22,777
REAGAN AS THE SMARTEST MAN ON

87
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:24,546
THE PLANET WITH UNLIMITED ENERGY

88
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:25,880
IT WAS HILARIOUS.

89
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,382
YOU NEED AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE

90
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,117
OR IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY AND THEN

91
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:32,253
IT'S JUST A PERSONAL ATTACK AND

92
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,821
BORING AND A YAWN FEST.

93
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,156
GRIFF: MICHAEL LET ME TAKE YOU

94
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,457
QUICKLY INTO THE WRITING PART OF

95
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,592
THIS BECAUSE WHEN IT CAME TO

96
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,726
MICHELLE WOLF'S SPEECH IS IT

97
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:39,928
YOUR SENSE THAT THEY WROTE WITH

98
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:43,531
A REAL INTENT TO EXPRESS THE

99
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,066
HATRED THAT CAME OUT OF THAT,

100
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,801
THAT THEY DIDN'T TRY AND WRITE

101
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,437
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE FUNNY AND

102
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,072
EDGEY BUT ACTUALLY HATEFUL.

103
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,907
>>  THEIR WRITING FOR THEIR

104
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:54,642
FRIENDS IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

105
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,177
TODAY I'M SURE THE GIRL WHO

106
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,512
HOSTED I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER I

107
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,247
DON'T KNOW HER NAME, SHE'S GOING

108
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,882
TO GO TO HER FRIENDS I SAID IT.

109
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,717
I DID THE JOKE AND SARAH WAS

110
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:03,351
RIGHT THERE.

111
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,453
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S FUNNY

112
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:06,754
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SHE'S NOT

113
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,389
EVEN TRYING TO ENTERTAIN ANYBODY

114
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,225
SHE'S GOT AN AGENDA SHE WANTED

115
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,060
TO HURT PEOPLE' FEELINGS SHE

116
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,728
WANTED TO PLANT HER FLAG ON

117
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:15,363
MOUNT HURT A LOT AND BRAG ABOUT

118
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:16,464
IT THE NEXT DAY.

119
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:17,298
ABBY: YEAH.

120
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:20,034
>>  IT'S BORING AND IT'S SAD AND

121
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,170
IT'S NOT THE SPIRIT IN WHICH

122
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,104
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

123
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,539
EVERYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A

124
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,974
GOOD TIME AT THE ROAST AND SADLY

125
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,508
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

126
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,743
YOU WANT TO SMACK THE OTHER

127
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:31,679
PERSON DOWN AND HAVE AN AGENDA.

128
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,014
PETE: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT BUT

129
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,449
IT'S PREDICTABLE AND BORING

130
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,451
WHICH IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF

131
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,953
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WASHINGTON

132
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,989
TOWNSHIP IN MICHIGAN TOTALLY

133
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,423
UNPREDICTABLE BUT INTERESTING

134
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,492
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE

135
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,460
HE'S GOING TO GO NEXT.

136
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,162
WHY CAN'T COMEDY MAYBE LEARN

137
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:48,563
FROM TRUMP?

138
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,397
I DON'T KNOW.

139
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,165
I DON'T KNOW BUT I HAVE MORE FUN

140
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,400
WATCHING A TRUMP RALLY THAN I

141
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,568
DID THE WHITE HOUSE

142
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:54,569
CORRESPONDENT'S DINNER.

143
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,204
HE'S A BETTER COMIC.

144
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,805
ABBY: IT'S A GREAT POINT.

145
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,107
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US AND

146
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:00,208
KEEP DOING YOUR SHOW BECAUSE IT

147
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,109
MAKES US LAUGH.

148
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,944
WE NEED SOME REFRESHING COMEDY

149
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,244
TODAY.

150
00:04:03,244 --> 00:00:00,000
PETE: THANK YOU, SIR.
