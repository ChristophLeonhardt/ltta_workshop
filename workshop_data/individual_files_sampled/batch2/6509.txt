Donald Trump nominating judges it's the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh Gorsuch but what about federal judges well a new report looks into how Trump has succeeded in nominating and confirming federal judges who actually end up being the final you know say in controversial issues and legislation so first let me give you some context about what happened under the Obama administration and what's happening now so under the Obama administration Mitch McConnell fought tooth and nail not only to prevent the confirmation of Merrick garland who was a Supreme Court nominee pick by Obama he also fought pretty aggressively to prevent federal judges from being nominated and confirmed so during the final two years of the Obama administration in which Republicans controlled the Senate the confirmation of judicial nominees slowed to a crawl giving McConnell and Trump plenty of vacancies to fill starting in 2017 and guess what McConnell's certainly succeeded the Senate has already installed 24 appellate judges since Trump was sworn in that's the highest number for a president's first two years in office so he's setting a record there and it's not a record that we should be excited about because these are all judges who are you know Federalist Society favorites they're super conservative and remember a lot of a lot of decisions don't even make it to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court will reject certain cases and these are the judges who are the people who have the final say now I'm going to show you a video from 2015 this is a Mitch McConnell talking about how he's gonna prevent Obama's judges from being confirmed take a look and my last question goes to judicial nominations I am one of those people who wouldn't wouldn't confirm another judge given the antics they pulled last year but what is the situation visa vie federal judicial nominations in the process in the Senate right now well so far the only judges we've confirmed have been federal district judges that have been signed off on by Republican senator and do you expect that that will continue to be the case for the balance of this session I think that's highly likely up okay so he's clear about what he did now the next video will infuriate you because it's Donald Trump totally spinning this and making it seem like it was a failure on Obama's part you know what I got in we had over a hundred federal judges that were on a point mattered a why Obama left that it was like a big beautiful present to all of us why the hell did he leave that maybe he got complacent that's world changing country changing USA changing and we're going all out but we were left the present I never said this before it was like the gift from heaven we were left judges they're the ones that judge on your disputes they judge on what's fair on the environment and what's not fair where they're going to take your farms and factories away and where they're not amazing it was the gift thank you very much president obama we all appreciate it okay what happened how do we do I'm sure they didn't explain to Trump the whole thing III mean I I I'm sure I'm sure they just explained hey look we've got all these these court appointments that we can make and it's gonna change the face of America and you could be the guy to change it this is really great news and and Trump was on the golf course anyway at the time so he said great do it it sounds good and then he's just in essence you know creating and parroting something that he's heard before the obstruction by Republicans in Congress specifically you know Republican senators during the Obama administration was just disgusting and also like the weakness from Democrats in office was also disgusting like fight fight there was very little fighting there was very little you know bravery from from Democrats at that time and now we're paying the consequences for that so there are 179 authorized judgeships for the US Court of Appeals with 24 confirmations and 13 vacancies to fill Trump and the Republicans have the power to install more than 20% of the judges on the nation's second-highest courts by the way these confirmations are not based on votes on partisan lines like you have Democrats confirming them as well so that you know goes to show you that Democrats they're incredibly weak when it comes to this stuff publicans fight yes that was maybe to get them from the Democratic side you get maybe these guys that are controlling things when you have the presidents they're trying to get from kind of appointees that they'll accept oh if we do some one it's more middle ground maybe they'll accept it when over and over again as we saw Hugh Hewitt show when McConnell was there the plan is to do nothing you talk about his proudest moment was to make sure that this president didn't get a nominee and it's outside of the Supreme Court nominee every other kind of nominee remember when pundits and conservative talkers were saying hey you know what this three vacancies on this particular appellate court we can work with that many we really don't need that many judges do we for some reason they suddenly need all these judges suddenly the judges are in place and and Trump in his foolishness there in that clip he said these judges will the judge air disputes your environment policies your farms in other words he sees the judges as a way to confirm his policies about environmental policies what he's doing with farms what he's doing with corporations he sees everyone is backing him up or against him not not judging on a case-by-case fair basis as a judge to do with his judgment but because hey I appointed you you do what I say this dictatorship works that way well he's absolutely right they are going to affect an environmental policy the poisons that go into the air the land the water all established by those courts and the cultural footprint of this country is going to change with all of these appointments absolutely it's it's depressing so just remember that this is not an issue that only impacts us impacts us while Trump is in office this is an issue that will have an impact on our politics on our country for decades even Trump understood that yeah he straight-up yeah this world changing it's America changing yeah I mean this is a cultural toxin and it may be one of the worst things that this administration does yeah cuz it has a lasting effect two easy ways for Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do
