your father comes off is absolutely brilliant in how he handled you which is something obviously a lot of parents try to do they blow it what was it that finally got you over that hurdle because he dragged you to Lake Placid to train first three months you're telling him how awful it is but then suddenly something starts to click what made you stay there I don't know it's it's hard to describe because you know hey my dad wasn't there I had really no true parents and it was kind of I started kind of actually enjoy what I was doing I mean the sport was actually something that I was it was kind of fun I think I can be kind of good at this and then I think my natural instincts started to come out of trying to be a competitor and being competitive athlete and then I started to gain success as well and that's what kind of fueled me to strive and push for more you had this extraordinary success I think you won you were gonna go to the Olympic Trials in 1998 you're gonna make the team all that stuff but something happened you went back to Seattle hang out with friends at the age of fourteen I was number one in the u.s. not just my age would put all age groups so I was racing against guys who were 30 to 35 years old who have been skating for 25 plus years finished the World Championships went back home start doing the same things I was doing except my more severe and much more self-destructive and going down the wrong path that I was before I didn't know how this was a train I didn't know I should have been focused I didn't know what it meant to become another Kathleen I couldn't appreciate the Olympic pursuit so by the time I arrived back in the training camp I was like 25 pounds overweight I was a toy different person I didn't want to be there my thoughts were all negative I was in a downward spiral and I didn't I didn't put forth 100 percent myself maybe 30 percent and I end up going to those in 1980 1998 Olympic Trials and I essentially placed last I went from first to last in the course of a year and my dad was devastated not because I didn't make the team but because he saw an opportunity that perhaps was gonna be lost in my fingertips and he saw you know what Apollo like you're not doing everything you can do to be the best of this sport it'd be different if you had trained hard this year and you've given everything you've got you know everything you have and you'd still hadn't made the team at least you're gonna walk away and say you know what maybe it would maybe it wasn't my time it wasn't my day to win today but you can't say that there's all these ifs ands and buts in your life oh if I would have trained harder but if I would have done this oh if I would have got more sleep or rested more a train different a different way eating better he didn't want those those questions and that's when he basically brought the tough love upon me and drove me to a very remote location in Pacific minute Pacific Ocean place Coco palace Beach iron Springs Resort and gave me an ultimatum and said look Apollo you can choose whatever you want to do whatever path you take make sure it's the one that you want to dedicate yourself towards didn't didn't care which one it was and I had to make the decision on my own at 15 alone I had a cabin to stand but I mean there's no TV there's no real tile from the pay phone down the street there's no internet there's no computer nothing it's just you and nature so a lot of self dialog was created during these moments for me to basically come across and say what am i doing why am I here and how can I make a decision I didn't even know why I was there for the first couple of days then it started to come to me and it's the things you know like I said these these talks the self-talk started to occur
