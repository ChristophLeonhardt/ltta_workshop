00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,210
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN
THE ANTARCTIC TO FILM SOMETHING

CHANGE.

14
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,210
IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH
THE CULTURE THERE, THE

15
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,210
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES TRYING TO
SURVIVE THERE.

16
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,210

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,320
I'M GOING TO BE HIKING ON

33
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
THAT JUMPS OFF THERE.

34
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,600
I'M GOING TO BE GOING ON
BOATS.

37
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:02,969

I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING OUR

42
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,130
CAMPS.

43
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:25,960
I'M THEORIZING THAT WE
ARE NOT GOING TO DIE IMMINENTLY.

44
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:35,210
THIS IS HUMANITY AT ITS MOST
TENACIOUS.

45
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,070
OKAY, SO OBVIOUSLY THEY WENT TO
THE ARCTIC WHICH IS WHY THE
