1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,002
AND WE ARE DISCUSSING TRADE AND 

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,605
THE EU AND LOTS OF OTHER 

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:05,838
THINGS. 

4
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:06,472
TREMENDOUS NUMBERS ARE COMING 

5
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:08,274
OUT ON THE UNITED STATES AND 

6
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,277
OUR ECONOMY IS VERY GOOD. 

7
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:12,145
PROBABLY THE BEST IT'S EVER 

8
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:12,712
BEEN. 

9
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,816
AND WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO MAKING 

10
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,819
SOME VERY GOOD TRADE DEALS. 

11
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,421
FAIR TRADE DEALS FOR OUR 

12
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,757
TAXPAYERS AND FOR OUR WORKERS 

13
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,959
AND OUR FARMERS AND A LOT OF 

14
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,393
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. 

15
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:31,965
I THINK THE EU -- WE'LL BE 

16
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,599
MEETING WITH THEM FAIRLY SOON. 

17
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,269
THEY WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK 

18
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:36,903
SOMETHING OUT. 

19
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:43,576
AND IF WE WORK IT OUT IT WILL 

20
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:43,909
BE POSITIVE. 

21
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:44,810
>> IT WILL BE POSITIVE. 

22
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,179
BUT MR. PRIME MINISTER THANK 

23
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:46,913
YOU FOR BEING HERE. 

24
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,481
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE. 

25
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,352
AND CAN I ADD TO THIS THAT THE 

26
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,354
>> BETWEEN THE NETHERLANDS AND 

27
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,590
THE UNITED STATES IS OVER 400 

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,491
YEARS OLD. 

29
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,793
WE ARE ALLIES, AND WE HAVE 

30
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,096
ALWAYS BEEN FRIENDS. 

31
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,599
AND OUR TALKS WILL NO DOUBT 

32
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,966
FOCUS ON -- AND SECURITY. 

33
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,803
WE ARE BOTH CONVINCED THAT AS 

34
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:11,971
LEADERS OUR PRIME TASK IS 

35
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,007
ESSENTIALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT 

36
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,576
OUR COUNTRIES ARE SAFE AND 

37
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,510
STABLE AND THAT OUR ECONOMY IS 

38
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,646
PROVIDING JOBS AND FUTURE 

39
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,913
GROWTH FOR OUR PEOPLE. 

40
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,083
AND THERE ARE SO MANY 

41
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,616
OPPORTUNITIES BETWEEN THE 

42
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,117
UNITED STATES AND THE 

43
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,853
NETHERLANDS TO DO MORE BOTH IN 

44
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,122
THE AREA OF SECURITY AND IN THE 

45
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:33,026
AREA OF HAVING MORE JOBS AND 

46
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,294
TRADE AND INVESTMENTS. 

47
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:36,729
825,000 IN A JOB IN THE U.S. 

48
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:42,635
BECAUSE OF DUTCH INVESTMENTS 

49
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,704
AND A QUARTER OF A MILLION 

50
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,839
BECAUSE U.S. INVESTMENTS IN THE 

51
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:47,172
NETHERLANDS. 

52
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:48,575
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR 

53
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:48,908
DISCUSSIONS. 

54
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:49,742
>> THAT'S A GREAT HONOR. 

55
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,012
AND I JUST SPOKE WITH THE 

56
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,613
PRESIDENT ELECT OF MEXICO. 

57
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:56,582
WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION, 

58
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:59,419
ABOUT A HALF HOUR ALONG. 

59
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,887
WE TALKED ABOUT BORDER 

60
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,922
SECURITY, TRADE, NAFTA, WE 

61
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,390
TALKED ABOUT A SEPARATE DEAL, 

62
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,959
JUST MEXICO AND THE UNITED 

63
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,292
STATES. 

64
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,427
AND WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION 

65
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,860
AND I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP 

66
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,263
WILL BE A GOOD ONE. 

67
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,297
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 

68
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,034
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE 

69
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,102
A GOOD ONE. 

70
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,903
HE HAD A VERY EXCELLENT 

71
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:18,170
ELECTION. 

72
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,004
DID BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED. 

73
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:22,041
I TOLD HIM A NUMBER OF YEARS 

74
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,410
AGO WHEN I SAW HIM CAMPAIGNING 

75
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,945
FOR A DIFFERENT RACE, A 

76
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,046
DIFFERENT YEAR, SOME DAY HE'S 

77
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,849
GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF 

78
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,717
MEXICO. 

79
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,817
SO HE REMEMBERED THAT AND IT 

80
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,254
TURNED OUT TO BE CORRECT. 

81
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,289
WE HAD A GREAT TALK IN THE 

82
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:37,556
MORNING. 

83
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:40,927
I INTERVIEWED AND MET WITH FOUR 

84
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,896
POTENTIAL JUSTICES OF OUR GREAT 

85
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:44,263
SUPREME COURT. 

86
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:46,933
THEY ARE OUTSTANDING PEOPLE AND 

87
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,303
THEY ARE REALLY INCREDIBLE 

88
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,704
PEOPLE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT 

89
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,640
WAYS, ACADEMICALLY AND IN EVERY 

90
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,240
OTHER WAY. 

91
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,111
AND I HAD A VERY INTERESTING 

92
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:58,378
MORNING. 

93
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,947
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF 

94
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,481
MEXICO, AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT 

95
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,717
ELECT, I THINK HE'S GOING TO 

96
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:09,022
TRY AND DO VERY HARD AND HELP 

97
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,957
US WITH BORDER. 

98
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,127
WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLY BAD BORDER 

99
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,230
LAWS, IMMIGRATION LAWS, THE 

100
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,531
WEAKEST IN THE WORLD. 

101
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,335
LAUGHED AT BY EVERYBODY IN THE 

102
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:22,669
WORLD. 

103
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,274
AND MEXICO CAN HELP US 

104
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,809
STRAIGHTEN OUT OUR IMMIGRATION 

105
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:30,042
LAWS. 

106
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,978
BUT VERY INTERESTING MY FOUR 

107
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,445
MEETINGS. 

108
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,380
I'LL BE MEETING WITH TWO OR 

109
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,115
THREE MORE. 

110
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,483
AND WE'LL MAKE A DECISION ON 

111
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,151
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 

112
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,586
COURT, THE NEW JUSTICE. 

113
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,989
THAT WILL BE MADE OVER THE NEXT 

114
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,924
FEW DAYS, AND WE'LL BE 

115
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,326
ANNOUNCING IT ON MONDAY. 

116
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,961
I THINK THE PERSON THAT IS 

117
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:49,561
CHOSEN WILL BE OUTSTANDING. 

118
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,265
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 

119
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:00,106
I'LL BE ANNOUNCING THAT ON 

120
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:08,514
MONDAY.      

121
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,750
>> -- I HOPE THEY CHANGE THEIR 

122
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:10,950
WAYS. 

123
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,885
THEY HAVE BEEN TREATING US 

124
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,118
BADLY. 

125
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:16,356
AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE AT A 

126
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,990
DISADVANTAGE WITH THE WTO. 

127
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,726
AND WE'RE NOT PLANNING ANYTHING 

128
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,426
NOW. 

129
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,726
BUT IF THEY DON'T TREAT US 

130
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:22,261
PROPERLY, WE'LL BE DOING 

131
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,830
SOMETHING.               

132
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,604
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.    

133
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,705
>> AS YOU CAN SEE, THAT'S 

134
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,642
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE PRIME 

135
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:37,944
MINISTER OF THE NETHERLANDS 

136
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,648
POST MEETING VERY SHORT PRESS 

137
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,048
CONFERENCE THERE. 

138
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,450
STILL TAKING SHOUTED QUESTIONS. 

139
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,050
IF ANYTHING INTERESTING COMES 

140
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,820
OUT OF THAT WE'LL CUT TO IT. 

141
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,656
AND THE PRESIDENT TOUCHED ON A 

142
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:53,359
FEW OTHER ISSUES. 

143
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,862
HE SAID HE HAS INTERVIEWED FOUR 

144
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:56,562
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 

145
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:56,896
CANDIDATES. 

146
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,798
PLANS ON INTERVIEWING TWO OR 

147
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,098
THREE MORE. 

148
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,367
AND WANTS TO MAKE AN 

149
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,167
ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS CHOICE AS 

150
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:05,905
EARLY AS THE NINTH AFTER THE 

151
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,975
JULY 4th HOLIDAY WHICH ANYBODY 

152
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,476
WHO FOLLOWS COURT PROCEEDINGS 

153
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,612
WHICH OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAPPEN 

154
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:12,912
VERY OFTEN. 

155
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,348
BUT THAT'S A VERY ACCELERATED 

156
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,483
TIME FRAME FOR US. 

157
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,152
USUALLY PRESIDENTS WILL TAKE 

158
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:19,485
MUCH LONGER. 

159
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,788
REMEMBER, THERE WAS A LIST OF 

160
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,089
POTENTIAL CANDIDATES DURING THE 

161
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,559
LAST TIME HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 

162
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,326
TO CHOOSE SOMEONE. 

163
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,328
SO HE'S GOING FROM THAT LIST 

164
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,531
AND HAS NARROWED IT DOWN TO 

165
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,899
FOUR TO SIX VIMS. 

166
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:37,036
AND HE SAID HE HAD A 

167
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,838
CONVERSATION WITH THE NEW 

168
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,405
PRESIDENT-ELECT OF MEXICO. 

169
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,375
AND TOUCHED ON A BROAD VARIETY 

170
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,610
OF SUBJECTS, INCLUDING THE 

171
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,477
SECURITY OF THE BORDER. 

172
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,513
AND HE SAID HE WAS HOPING THAT 

173
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,416
THE NEW PRESIDENT WOULD HELP 

174
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:50,983
WITH THE BORDER. 

175
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,918
HE MADE AN INTERESTING COMMENT. 

176
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:55,221
HE SAID THAT MEXICO HAS VERY 

177
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,057
STRONG IMMIGRATION LAWS WHEREAS 

178
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,392
THE U.S. HAS WEAK IMMIGRATION 

179
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,727
LAWS THAT ARE LAUGHED AT BY THE 

180
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,494
REST OF THE WORLD. 

181
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,764
HE DIDN'T MENTION THE FACT THAT 

182
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,701
MOST OF THE PEOPLE COMING INTO 

183
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,002
THE U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER CAME 

184
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,138
THROUGH MEXICO FROM LATIN 

185
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:12,405
AMERICA. 

186
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,473
SO THEY HAVE STRONG IMMIGRATION 

187
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,309
LAWS BUT PEOPLE COME THROUGH
