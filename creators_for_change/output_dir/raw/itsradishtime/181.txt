video thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming over and I hope</font>

9
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,500
you'll stick around I went to Marquette

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,510
University where we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,279
really awesome basketball coach named

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,500
buzz williams and even though he

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,010
abandoned us for Virginia Tech I still

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,990
kinda admire the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all of the</font>

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,450
weird outfits dancing around and jumping

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,309
up and down aside the links right here

17
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,100
he said some pretty wise stuff I

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,840
remember once we are on this great

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">winning streak and merging awesome and</font>

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,710
feeling good and the reporter kind of

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,230
invited him to just bask in his success

22
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,480
but pretty much he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just refused to do it</font>

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,370
he said the hardest thing to get is

24
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,590
momentum and the hardest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to keep</font>

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,050
is momentum basically we know it's hard

26
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,570
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get on a roll doing the things but</font>

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,430
once again there that's not enough it's

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,489
constant work to keep succeeding and

29
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,860
keep getting better and I really took

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,700
that to heart because my friends I am

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,740
notoriously bad at finishing what I

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,020
start now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm lucky in that I</font>

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,210
get all sorts of great ideas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I come</font>

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with really cool project but as soon</font>

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the execution part starts getting</font>

36
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,049
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no which probably the most</font>

37
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">productive thing to you because then I</font>

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep starting over and over and</font>

39
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,409
wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get where I want to be but</font>

40
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:29,970
just being frustrated that I have to

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,590
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> from square one every time which</font>

42
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like just do it dude like don't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

43
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,750
lazy and I think that's why I like so

44
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,990
many other people love

45
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,240
love every day April or goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't break</font>

46
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,070
the chain kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things because you</font>

47
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,020
just commit yourself I'm gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

48
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,000
every day I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get me some</font>

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,070
momentum I mean it's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not easy</font>

50
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,470
like I felt super accomplished after i

51
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,240
finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> vita then once you have the</font>

52
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,250
moment I'm you got to keep it and that's

53
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,369
where I fail because it's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier</font>

54
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,299
to not do things and to do things I feel

55
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,310
like I made three videos in a row<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

56
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,920
one time and now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like other blog</font>

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,899
ideas for the rest of my life look am I

58
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,280
just saying the same things over<font color="#CCCCCC"> I works</font>

59
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,900

60
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,140
over and over but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway momentum so now</font>

61
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,060

62
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a manager schedule</font>

63
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,660

64
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,250
