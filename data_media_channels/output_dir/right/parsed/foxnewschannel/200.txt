AT NEXT REV FNC.
DON'T SEE ACTUALLY BERNIE
SANDERS TALKING ABOUT THIS.
I'LL SEE THE POPULACE BEHAVING
LIKE THIS.
THERE'S A GANG OF IDENTITY
POLITICS YOU JUST GIN UP ALL
THIS HATE AND IT'S SO
DESTRUCTIVE.
>> IT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
ALL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
DEMOCRATS AND ELITISTS HAVE
ALWAYS PLAYED THIS GAME.
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT
WAS BEFORE.
IT'S BEEN EXPOSED FOR WHAT IT
IS.
TRUMP IS MAKING PEOPLE COME OUT
AND FIGHT.
NOW THEY'RE SAYING WERE ALL
ABOUT THE FIGHT AND TOUGH WHEN
ONE MINUTE YOU SAY GO LOW AND GO
HI, WHICH ONE IS IT.
THERE IS A LETTER LAST WEEK
SAYING THERE'S NO MESSAGE NO
LEADER, NO CONSISTENCY.
I DON'T KNOW IF BERNIE SANDERS
IS SPEAKING LIKE THIS IN THE
PUBLIC BUT NOW ARE HAVING THESE
POLITICS.
I DID A POEM ABOUT IN 2014, I
BEEN BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE
KITCHEN AND SEEN WHAT THE COOKS
HAVE BEEN DOING.
>> I THOUGHT PEGGY NOONAN HAD AN
INTERESTING PIECE.
SHE SAID IT'S A BIT LIKE WHAT HE
WAS SAYING EARLIER.
THE REGULAR AMERICANS LOOK AT
THIS STUFF.
THE EVENTS, REACTION, LANGUAGE
AND STUFF WE HAVE SEEN.
THEY JUST THINK IT'S DEMONIC.
IT'S ALL REPELLENT.
IT IS, ISN'T IT?
>> THIS COULD BE THE GREAT
SQUANDERING OF AN OPPORTUNITY.
IF YOU SAW THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS
OF THE HOUSE YOU SAW REPUBLICANS
WINNING BARELY BUT DEMOCRATS
DOING DECENTLY IN RED STATES.
BY SEEMINGLY TO ACTIVELY DETEST
AMERICANS WHO ARE CONSERVATIVES
AND MODERATES YOU'RE ACTUALLY
TURNING THIS INTO A
RECAPITULATION OF 2016.
THERE'S 23 DISTRICTS WITH A
REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE WON BY
HILLARY CLINTON.
THEY MIGHT WIN BUT THEY WERE
MANY OTHER SEATS THEY MAY HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO WIND THAT THERE
LIKELY TO LOSE IN THE SENATE IS
FALLING OUT OF THEIR GRASP.
>> STEVE: THEY'VE LEARNED
NOTHING FROM 2016.
>> THEY'VE LEARNED NOTHING.
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THIS COUNTRY, LOT OF
INDEPENDENCE WHO DON'T LIKE
THIS.
THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T SEE
THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE.
THEY DON'T SEE US NOW AND THEY
WON'T SEE IT IN 2020 BECAUSE
THEY REJECT THE PEOPLE THINK
EVERYBODY THINKS THE WAY THEY DO
IN NEW YORK, D.C. IN LOS
