alright so we've been hearing for weeks that those of us who are in favor of second Amendment rights are somehow weird crazy right because we're all worried that they're gonna take our guns and what you'll hear from people and left is no we don't want to take your guns no we're not interested in in taking your doesn't to take your guns under it he said no no and then of course they argue that they want to take our guns the latest example of this comes courtesy a former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said John Paul Stevens was appointed by Republicans and then he proceeded to govern left of Ruth Bader Ginsburg that is not a joke if you actually look people have charted how particular justices govern and rule from the bench John Paul Stevens is one of the most liberal members of the court for nearly his entire tenure he was one of the worst picks I believe he was appointed by President Reagan Warren worst pics of President Reagan and he has just been disastrous in fact you know I'm gonna check that real fact with you that he was appointed by he may have been appointed by Nixon yeah he's pointed by by President Nixon rap oh sorry Gerald Ford he's appointed by Gerald Ford but he was one of Gerald Ford's worst moves and now he has an op-ed in the New York Times literally titled to repeal the Second Amendment which makes the second top ad in the New York Times in the last two years calling for full repeal of the Second Amendment after Brett Stevens wrote the same thing and Brett is their in-house conservative over there so John Paul Stevens writes this full op-ed about why we should get rid of the Second Amendment entirely first of all completely unrealistic in order to pass a constitutional amendment you require two-thirds approval of each house of Congress plus three-quarters of all state legislatures look at a map it's all read if there are 30-some governors in the United States who are Republican zero state legislatures are actually gonna pass this thing outside of California Massachusetts New York and maybe you know Minnesota or something and then the notion that a bunch of people are sitting around waiting to repeal the Second Amendment is just not accurate but let's go through John Paul Stevens is awful argument in the New York Times for why they were a Second Amendment should be repealed so he begins by praising the marches and rallies that have been taking place since the Parkland shooting he writes this rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday these demonstrations demand our respect they revealed the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society so number one this is stupid this is incredibly stupid Haley the if you really believe that big rallies mean that there's tremendous support for hardcore gay anti-gun legislation then you've never seen a rally before if first of all was rally within that bag there are 200,000 people who showed up in DC sizeable rally sure hey in 2000 there's the million mom March also for gun control also anti NRA and three-quarters of a million people showed up in Washington DC at that point I believe Bill Clinton was still president technically and nothing happened zero things happen there is it and there's been serious seriously pretty much zero gun legislation between two thousand and two thousand eighteen despite multiple major rallies on gun control and it's worth noting that when tea partiers were out there by the hundreds of thousands nobody seems to care about that either every year the March for life happens in several hundred thousand people and pro-life legislation does not inevitably follow nor would people on the left suggest Wow look at the public support for that that means we suddenly have to get rid of abortion rights so this is really dumb and then he continues he says the marches are a sign that it's time to seriously curb weapons ownership quote that support is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semi-automatic weapons increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms but the demonstrator should seek more effective and more lasting reform they should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment so it's not enough to pass a law that would bar civilian ownership of semi-automatic weapons which is to say virtually every weapon in the United States again for those who don't know anything about guns a semi-automatic weapon just means you pull the trigger once and one bullet fires and another one is loaded into the chamber that is all a semi-automatic weapon is that's the only thing that distinguishes between a revolver and a semi-automatic weapon is that there is a is there is a changing cylinder in a revolver that doesn't exist in a semi-automatic weapon virtually every weapon in the United States unless it is boat loading muzzle loading or a revolver is a semi-automatic weapon virtually all of them and there are 300 million of them in the United States so he said well my problem just covered a semi-automatic weapons everything will be fine yeah yeah good luck with that one okay but then he says that he wants the Second Amendment gone so it's not enough to just get rid of it and then I love this that the left keeps saying that we're just idly worried about second Amendment rights being violated we're not we can have common-sense gun regulations yeah at least even's is being honest at least he's being honest so he says let's get rid of the Second Amendment entirely he says quote concerned that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment which provides the quote a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed today that concern is a relic of the 18th century well no no it isn't ok the concern that the federal government would invade our rights and in really egregious manner and that we might need guns to protect ourselves I'm wondering how that a relic of the 18th century when we have had beyond the 18th century full-on slavery in the United States Jim Crow removal of gun rights from black folks removal of gun rights from from a wide variety of people including japanese-americans during world war ii and the forcible imprisonment of Japanese during the World War two it seems to me that in armed papa raishin is a better guarantee than sitting around thinking that the government will never go to radical it just is that's not to suggest that every armed rebellion is good or that it will end well or that armed rebellions are largely successful but one of the reasons that the government doesn't go for tyrannical is because they know that there are 100 million people in the United States who own guns try telling a bunch of Texans they are not violating their rights when you say you want to go into their basements and take out all of their guns again good luck with that this is not this concern is it you know historically ignorant you have to be to believe that it's a relic of the 18th century to worry about centralized government taking your guns and then invading your rights it's happened in virtually every tyrannical country it's happened in China it has happened in the Soviet Union it's happened in Nazi Germany the sort of stuff happens all the time routinely a lot so then he continued says for over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment it was uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or state authority to enact gun control legislation in 1939 the Supreme Court unanimously held that Congress could prohibit the possession of a sawed-off shotgun because that weapon had no reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a quote/unquote well-regulated militia well that's not even a real reading of the case that's a bad reading of the case if the idea here is that you have to be a member of the militia in order to carry a gun that is absolutely untrue it is not true at the time of the founding it is not true throughout American history it's not even true in the case that Stephens is citing stevens was a bad Supreme Court justice and he's an ignoramus when it comes to actual jurisprudence ok the case he's citing his United States versus Miller in 1939 Justice Scalia explained this case to Stephens in his opinion in DC versus in Heller versus DC he said quote Miller did not hold that and cannot be possibly read to have held that quote the judgments in the case upheld against a Second Amendment challenge to men's federal convictions for transporting an unregistered short barreled shotgun in interstate commerce in violation of the National Firearms Act it is entirely clear that the courts basis for saying the Second Amendment did not apply was not that the defendants were bearing arms not for military purposes rather it was the type of weapon at issue was not eligible for the Second Amendment protection this whole thing is consists not only consistent with but positively suggests that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms the only arms that have some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a railroad well-regulated militia and the court believed that the Second Amendment protects only those serving in the militia it would have been odd to examine the character of the weapon rather than simply note that the true two crooks were not militiamen furthermore this has been understood for literally hundreds of years one of the reasons in the Dred Scott decision the evil horrible Dred Scott decision in which the Supreme Court decided that black people in America could not be full citizens of the United States hey justice Tony wrote in that decision that one of the reasons black people could not be citizens of the United States is that if you made them citizens of the United States then they'd be able to carry guns the obvious underlying assumption being that citizens of the United States have the ability to carry guns that they have the right to carry guns under the Constitution of the United States and here's what justice Tony wrote in that evil Dred Scott decision quote it would give to persons of the Negro race who are recognized as citizens in any one state of the Union the right to enter every other state whenever they please it would give them full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which citizens might speak to hold public meetings upon political affairs and to keep and carry arms wherever they went and the scared Justice xx this is why he said that we wouldn't allow black people to be citizens and that they had to remain sort of property and this evil decision he said because if you were to make them citizens then there are rights that comes along with being a citizen one of those rights is carrying firearms but Stevens isn't done then he quotes Chief Justice Warren burger who's the man responsible for such constitutional abominations as Roe versus Wade and he says that chief Warren burger used to say that the NRA was stupid well who cares the chief Lorne burger had to say that guy was a terrible Justice Warren burger was such a bad justice the Potter Stewart another justice on the Supreme Court leach dramatically to Woodward and Bernstein his Karl Woodward was a Bernstein Woodward it was to one of them I in their book the Brethren okay the Brethren is a book about the inside workings of the Supreme Court Potter Stewart hated Warren burger so much that he leaked the entire book okay to to Woodward and Bernstein about why Warren burger was an idiot everybody on the court thought Warren burger was an idiot except for John Paul Stevens apparently okay so in any case he then rips into District of Columbia vs. Heller that's DC vs. Heller the 2008 case that Rhian shrined the American right to keep him bare and keeping bear arms and here's what Stevens concludes he says that decision which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable has provided the NRA with a propaganda weapon of immense power well actually they had a second amendment before that overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of Second Amendment would be simple it would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option okay so it would be easy to get rid of the Second Amendment go ahead and try left us please do it make this your rally and cry please tell Republicans all over the country they're gonna take away their weapons and repeal the Second Amendment do it I dare you you want to see yourselves get killed in November politically speaking you want to see it just construed politically speaking do this push for a giant gun control effort okay in just a second I'm going to talk about another idiotic rant on gun control but first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at the u.s. CCA hey as you may have noticed your gun rights are in fact under attack the folks on the Left are interested in taking away your gun rights and that's why we are working very hard to ensure that

yourself safe and know how to do it get your free copy of the complete mass shooting Survival Guide from the US CCI defend my family now calm that's defend my family now calm okay I wasn't the only dumb notion that was being pushed by the left today from John Paul Stevens there is also a tweet storm from Michael Ian Black who's a comedian and that means that he must know lots about guns right because he's a comedian so that means that he knows a lot about guns so here's his Tweed storm he says quote I'll say it assault weapons aren't the problem handguns are the problem by all means be ar-15s and the like but handguns kill far more people the solution is to repeal and replace the Second Amendment make gun ownership a privilege not right okay at least they're being honest now at least Michael Ian Black and John Paul Stevens they're being honest now and they will be increasingly honest as time goes on I'm old enough to remember when the Democrats claimed they weren't for nationalized health care and now of course this has become a thing they like to do is nationalize health care and Michael Ian Black continues along these lines he says thirty-eight thousand Americans died from gun violence last year what number would you like to compromise to twenty thousand well no I'd like that number to be zero but let's recognize the thirty eight thousand Americans didn't I have gun violence 2/3 of those died of suicide and among the others were a various number of criminals and then he continues along these lines as well cutlery doesn't cause obesity's but guns do caused gun deaths well that's idiotic guns do not cause gun deaths that's like saying guns cause death no the person who pulls the trigger cause death the person who uses the cutlery is what makes them fat so actually this is just dumb and the stupidity continues is it long round yes having the ready ability to take someone's life is dominion over that person gun ownership could be viewed as slavery by another name so me owning a gun and protecting myself is slavery so I'm glad to know that Michael Ian Black is a complete historical ignoramus as you may have heard just a few moments ago the Dred Scott decision was fearful that black people would have guns in fact gun control legislation in the South was specifically designed for literally a hundred years to prevent black people from being able to protect themselves listen to Condoleezza Rice talk about her dad having a gun and how he helped protect her family with that gun if you really believe the gun ownership is slavery you have no knowledge of history contemporary politics or gun ownership I mean this is just inane it's just inane gun ownership due to slavery I'll tell you what slavery but slavery is me giving up my gun to a government that says it will protect me then they let me die in a hail of bullets when a criminal just decides not to obey the law but he's not done yet Michael Ian Black continues how's it working out for people of color now somebody points out to him that black people have not been able to get guns historically that's been bad for them he says how's it working out for people of color now well considering the black people are largely shooting black people and white people are largely shooting white people it's hard to imagine that people of color one their gun rights removed law-abiding people of color want their gun rights removed that's a weird argument so again all these arguments are sort of weird and then he he finally continues and he says yes evidence supports the fact that easy access to guns increases suicide attempts and successful suicides in fact the evidence is mixed on that the Japanese suicide rate has remained intensely high despite the fact that very few guns in the country again none of this has any relationship to reality but doesn't matter folks on the Left they're firmly convinced it's time to get rid of the Second Amendment and we thank them for their honesty because now we can have a real debate a real conversation it's all I asked for from Piers Morgan years ago just tell me the truth about what you want and then guess what guess what we can have a conversation and we can decide whether Americans are really ready to surrender their right to self-defense and the right to keep and bear arms to a government that fails to protect them on a regular basis okay so meanwhile a lot of hubbub has broken out about quote-unquote attacks on the students of parkland no one's attacking the students of parkland we're attacking their arguments they have a right to speak out we all feel terrible for them obviously witnesses to a shooting have gone through something traumatic and horrible it does not make them experts on gun control we're all making the same argument here and it's amazing to see which survivors of gun violence are actually put in the media and how the media plays this stuff up so I do love this morning Joe did another one of their ubiquitous montages this montage had to do with the March for March for our lives on Saturday and they played joe scarborough's protest song over it so here's what that montage sounded like and they're showing all of these marches about Vietnam and now they're trying this montage Iraq and there's a Tim been square they showed this yesterday hey the march against poverty and now there it is the March for our lives okay so they basically just recut this montage in order to include the March for our lives okay then the real reason for this of course the the real reason that they decide to show this montage is they can push joe scarborough's crappy song love it in the only way that you know scarborough can sell his song is to do montages on Morning Joe where they play a song like nobody's buying the song apparently so it's like if every time I played something sad on the show I played myself playing Schindler's List hey Joe Scarborough has to play it's just amazing every time there's a protest now he's gonna find like three guys standing outside of McDonald's protesting for a raise and suddenly Joe Scarborough is gonna show up with his guitar and start playing it's gonna be amazing I just I love it I love it it's so it's so self-serving and so self-aggrandizing it's incredible okay but speaking of the students who must never ever be their arguments must never be attacked again it's amazing which victims we choose to focus on so the Eagles of Death Metal frontman went after the students he said that these parkland students are acting inappropriately he is of course exactly right and and here is what he had to say he he unleashed a torrent of criticism they put up a bunch of posts and in some of the posts he said that some of the student marshals were quote-unquote pathetic and disgusting for playing hooky at the expense of 16 of her classmates blood and then he shared this image of Emma Gonzales ripping up the US Constitution now what's funny about that is I don't know if you've seen this going around but there is an image it's a Jif that's been photoshopped of Emma Gonzales tearing up a copy of the US Constitution anybody who watches it knows that this is obviously a Jif that is meant to be symbolic that Emma Gonzales doesn't like to guess Constitution and therefore she's ripping it up if you believe that chip was real or that picture was real then you're an idiot but the media is playing it like the entire right believes that picture is real that of course is not true anyway he says quote as the survivor of a mass shooting I can tell you from firsthand experience that all of you protesting and did taking days off from school insult the memories of those who were killed and abuse and insult me and every other of liberty by your every action may every one of these disgusting vile abusers of the Dead live as long as possible so they can have the maximum amount of time to enjoy their shame and be cursed like a some pretty harsh language I wouldn't use it but does he have unquestioned moral authority Jesse Hughes he's the bandleader of Eagles of Death Metal who was of course at the bottle on when that place was shot up right it was his concert that was attacked does he have unquestioned moral authority is he allowed to question other survivors or there's only certain survivors that we give on question moral authorities and then and then I do like this he tweeted out a graphic this is pills that are hard to swallow our guns aren't going anywhere there are only two genders and Donald Trump will be a president for you yeah it's a little bit fun yeah well I will admit and again are we allowed to question the arguments of students because some of the argument are really dumb so here's one parklands student who is saying that who's on on with brian Stelter and inadvertently saying something really true and really profound about the state of journalism in our country i think that for me the purpose of journalism is to raise you know the voices of people that maybe don't have a voice and so I think that in its own right journalism is a form of activism okay so a lot of people on the Left we're saying for what we're trying to distance themselves from this comment that journalism is a form of activism it is pretty obvious in the wake of these shootings that journalism is indeed a form of activism I've been saying this for a very long time it's why I call myself an opinion journalist I'm honest about it folks at CNN are not honest about it and they claim that their objective news journalists in reality they do have an agenda they are pushing that agenda they are pushing that agenda day in and day out no wonder the student journalist believes that journalism is activism she watches CNN of course she believes journalism is activism if I watch CNN on a regular basis I believe that to a journalism for CNN is indeed activism this is how journalists see themselves in fact I remember I visited the ABC News offices with the god-king of The Daily wire Jeremy boring and one of the things that's head on the wall was something to the effect of we give voice to the voiceless and I just thought to myself that's not journalism journalism isn't about giving voice to the voiceless it's about objectively covering facts but people in the journalistic business believe that it is their job to actually push a particular political agenda they believe that they are do-gooders in the world not just people covering the news and informing folks this girl has obviously imbibed from that and she's just spitting back what what she's heard from the media unfortunately she told the truth a little bit too honestly right there for the media to handle okay so in just a second we will get to stormy Daniels fall we'll get to Paul Ryan and all the rest but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Jen you sell so you've been wishing that those bags under your eyes would

Daniels controversy continues now let's be real about this the real reason that people care about stormy Daniels it gives them an excuse to Google stormy Daniels lesbian activity on Google Images hey let's be real about this mr. macdaniel's were not a porn star nobody would care about this because if we're going to pretend that people are deeply worried about the corruption of the Trump administration there are a thousand other stories that seem to go deeper on the on the quote-unquote corruption stuff than the stormy Daniels thing now is it sort of a clean bust then Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to shut her Yap when it came to the election time yeah that's bad he's a campaign finance reform violation not sure i mean john edwards paid nine hundred thousand dollars to a woman to keep her Yap shut after he fathered a child with her right well he was married to his cancer-ridden wife so that is not yeah I'm not sure that that this violates campaign finance law what's funny is that Trump's approval ratings continue to go up so yesterday there was a big stock market bounce the stock market yesterday jumped something like six hundred and eighty points or seven hundred points who's the third biggest stock market gain in one day in American in the history of the stock market actually that is uh that's not super surprising because there's such a big stock market adjustment yesterday the stock market is up again today so you know it's it's up and down it's up and down I think part of that is because all of the tariffs talked that's happening from the Trump administration is starting to soften just a little bit so the talk before was that Trump was going to slap these tariffs on products and leave them there forever and now the talk is that he's gonna slap the tariffs on long enough to negotiate a better deal if the latter is true and then all right I guess that's okay if the latter is not true then the stock market will go back down again but in any case people who are wondering why Trump's approval rating is going up beyond obviously the economics of all of this one of the reasons that the the approval ratings are going up is because when you talk about a rich dude stripping pornstars most people are like well yep remember Donald Trump was elected after building an entire apartment decorated by Saddam Hussein's decorator Donald Trump is not exactly genteel about his wealth hey it's funny when growing up my grandparents my mom's parents were relatively wealthy I wouldn't say that they were like hugely enormously successful but they owned their own home they had their own business but one of the things that I always appreciate about my grandparents they never showed off their wealth they always drove a normal car they were not people who were garish in there in there in in their spendthrift ways there are a lot of folks who get rich and then they decide that they're going to demonstrate to the entire world just how wealthy they are but the best people are the people who you meet you don't know that they're wealthy well Donald Trump is not one of those people right Doug got famous for being the really gauche guy on lifestyles on the rich and famous that was essentially his profile for a very long time and there are a lot of folks in the United States who want to be Donald Trump it should be frank about this there's an aspirational side to Donald Trump that appeals to the worst of our sensibilities we're people who are poor look at Donald trum they think if I were rich you know many porn stars I would know a lot man I would really go for it okay so Donald Trump stopping a porn start not a shock again I'm not sure why we're supposed to be surprised Melania Trump posed naked with other women during the time that Trump dating her and went on Howard Stern and talked too openly about their sex life together like Milania now is is pretty classy but back in the day when Trump met her not so much I mean I believe he was still married to wife number two when he started going going with Melania and when he was dating wife number two he was still married wife number one in fact there's a famous story I'm not sure whether it's apocryphal or not I'm fairly certain it is not but the story is supposedly that when Donald Trump was married to Ivana right who was involve the Donald Trump was dating wife number two right to his marlowe mates and Marla mates was at the same resort where Donald was keeping one wife Fran says he's keeping wife number one on one floor and he was keeping his mistress on another floor and Ivana discovered that Trump was in fact schtooping soon-to-be wife number two on a different floor of the hotel she found out about it while he was on the ski slopes and she went up to the top of the ski slopes with him he tried to ski away from her and she was yelling at him the entire way down the hill while skiing backwards because it vaana's actually heard expert skier so again the the weird idea that Donald Trump is some sort of prophetic godlike wonderful Christian figure on sexual morality is absurd in fact one of the reasons he's popular is because Donald Trump is the guy who unapologetically stops porn stars so when they're when he's in the news for stopping porn stars and most guys are googling to figure out how stormy Daniels looks naked he's not gonna lose approval ratings from dudes on that score and most women are gonna look at stormy Daniels and go like are we supposed to believe she's a victim his moment about sex for money likely this is her entire career is to have sex for money on camera and she herself has said she's not a victim she herself has said that she is not a me-too person that she fully consented to sex with Trump and so we're thinking to ourselves a lot of Americans are thing to ourselves I'm not sure what the big deal is here now again is it immoral yes it's not all trumpet immoral that with women yes should he be paying off women to keep silent no is any of this surprising no none of the surprised and none of this is surprising the only thing that is mildly surprising is the White House keeps denying the underlying claim so here's the White House yesterday being asked about stormy Daniels and is Raj Shah from the briefing room being asked about stormy Daniels and and not coming up with a fantastic answer did you speak categorically that the president his campaign and the Trump Organization did not violate federal law specifically election laws regarding that payment well I can speak for only the White House and I can say categorically obviously White House didn't engage in any any wrongdoing the campaign or mr. Cohen yeah the campaign or mr. Cohen can address anything with respect to their actions with respect to that interview I will say the president strongly clearly and has consistently denied these underlying claims and the only person who's been inconsistent is the one making the claims well I mean to be fair do you believe that store McDaniels have sex with Trump because I do like the some of the inconsistency from stormy Daniels is fully driven by her career right she took the money when she felt like that was the money she could get to shut up and then she decided to speak up when she feels like there's more money in it to speak up store McDaniels is no heroine here story is stormy Daniels is a woman who had an affair with a married man fully knowing that he was married and did so for career reasons and then she went quiet when it was time for her to get paid by the Trump campaign basically by by Michael Cohen and then she decided to not shut up anymore when it became obvious that she could make a lot more money by not shutting up anymore so stormy Daniels is not a victim here that doesn't mean that Trump is a saint we have this tendency in American politics to say that there can't be two villains in the same story that if stormy Daniels is terrible than Trump is wonderful and if Trump is terrible than stormy Daniels is wonderful how about they're both scuzz okay just in terms of personal morality and sexual morality they are both just gross and stormy Daniels his lawyer is showing that on a pretty regular basis or me Daniels is doing like stripping tours now okay like right now in the middle

has the dress from the night that stormy Daniels and Donald Trump got it on do you know are you aware that she has any such evidence and she spoken to you about it or shown you anything along those lines I am unaware about text messages or pictures or any type of evidence she might have that would fit on a disk all I know is that stormy still has the dress that she wore from that night mm-hmm and she kept that for what reason may be keepsake maybe it's because it's actual proof I can only speculate the things that may be on that dress especially if it's never been washed understood we'll leave that there yi not again are we doomed to live 1998 over and over again in perpetuity hi guys this is one of the reasons why you should not put that there without that thing on it I mean like come on okay also I do love this story this story is from the Washington Post President Trump has privately sold several people that adult film star storming Daniels's allegation but fair with him are a hoax and that Daniels isn't the type of woman he finds attractive what is that that really is the strongest case that he really is saying that stormy Daniels is not the kind of woman that he finds attractive okay I am currently looking up a picture of Marla maples Marla maples a dead ringer for the second your Marla maples looks a lot like that woman and if you look up a picture of Ivana Trump when Ivana Trump was young if on a Trump looked guess like whom Ivana Trump looked she was a blonde buxom young woman guess who she looked like stormy Daniels Donald Trump has a type okay Melania actually is less of his type then stormy Daniels is but just what come on just come on again none of this is believable but none of its gonna hurt Trump in in any real sense anyway because as I say it's all baked into the cake I don't think anything here is gonna change now the only thing that could change is if somehow stormy Daniels comes up with these sort of evil deep threatener in 2011 so one of the allegations stormy Daniels made during that interview on CBS on 60 minutes was that in 2011 she was ready to tell all to In Touch magazine which shows you how hot Trump was in 2011 the only people who would pay for this story were in touch for 15 grand and then she was approached by someone some dark mysterious figure who came to her in a parking lot and said stormy your child may grow up without a mother if you ever tell the story about how Trump stepped you now is it possible that happened sure it's possible that happened maybe we'll find out that was Michael Conant I have my serious doubts that any of this is true but storming Daniels's lawyer is going after Michael Cohen where all of this is just Jerry Springer material and that's how most people in America are treating it at this point because honestly the only reason anybody's watching this is because stormy Daniel support and start again for the 30th time let's talk about Michael Cohen what kind of man this is this is the kind of guy who claimed in connection with that story that there's no such thing as spousal rape this is a legal genius right right completely false the guy doesn't even know the law he's a thug your friend okay I love that Anderson Cooper who's supposed to be the guy keeping a lid on this he's just sitting back and letting it happen to me it's your one second away from Jerry Jerry that's that's the next thing that happens is that a vendetta this this lawyer is gonna like pick up a chair and clock this guy thug Thug that's a million dollars a million a thug Thug come on come on we're supposed to take the scandal seriously I'm sorry I'm having a tough time taking the scandal seriously when the only reason everyone is in it is for the Peorians appeal that's really the only reason now is Michael Kohn an idiot yes of course Michael Kong's an idiot Michael Khan's adult Michael holds a fool like I don't know why this is a shock to anyone Michael Kohn is a guy who said that spousal rape is not a thing okay which is idiotic Michael Kohn is the guy who you recall from the last election cycle he's on CNN and in the middle of the election cycle when Trump was losing by like 10 points he was asked on CNN by a Brianna Keller why what was his opinion on the polls and Michael Cohen said what polls you remember this clip it went and went viral at the time okay so is this is any of this shocked no but this not coming off as something that's threatening to the office of the presidency you know the the famous quote is that history doesn't doesn't repeat itself but it does rhyme or that history repeats itself the first time as as tragedy the the first time is comedy the second time is tragedy well I think in this case it's the reverse the first time was the tragedy and now we get to watch the comedy because this is uproariously funny stuff if you cannot appreciate the fact that America's culture has gone down in a flaming ball of crap and we're all just watching from the sidelines as it happens and talking about stormy freakin Daniels Stephanie Clifford and Donald J Trump the President of the United States every so often you just have to look around and realize that we're actually living inside a Salvador Dali painting yeah this is one of those moments where you realize that the Salvador Dali painting has come to life the clocks are melting off the side of the wall and and all of the dimensions have been screwed around with among other things so it's the Trump by the way has been completely silent about the stormy the annuals thing which is probably the best indicator that a lot of it is true but there's no reason for him to talk about it he should keep silent there's nothing in it for Trump to talk openly about all this stuff because again anything he says is just gonna be more more fodder for the fire but I will say the media's attempts to turn stormy Daniels into some sort of terrible victim case and and some sort of you know heroine speaking her truth okay this is a woman who's on the make Trump was on the make they're both gross there's a reason they had sex with each other even though she was not attracted to him and even though he was married at the time because both of them are just yucky humans okay this is not a complicated story yucky humans tend to be yucky and those yucky humans continue to be yucky for years now none of this is to say the Trump is a bad president none of this is to say that Trump is not doing things that I like in the office of the presidency but I think that we ought to acknowledge realities about human character and the realities of the characters involved in this ain't nothing good happening here these are not people you want your kids living up to okay so meanwhile the only good news for the Republicans is the Democrats the Democrats continue to struggle with the fact that their party is split in serious measure between radicals and and non radicals right between radicals and people who are who are trying to move to the moderate middle on the moderate middle side people like Claire McCaskill so Claire McCaskill's of course the senator from Missouri her seat is in serious trouble in Missouri quite possible Missouri which has moved hard red goes against Claire McCaskill and McCaskill is trying to disown sort of the radicalism of her own party by throwing Hillary Clinton under the bus this has been an additional move by a lot of folks on the left recently so I won the places that are optimistic diverse dynamic and moving forward were these comments from Hillary Clinton helpful to you no probably not you know I understand the point she was trying to make but it felt like she was criticizing Missouri voters and I would draw I mean talking about drawing a line I would draw a line there I have great respect for Missouri voters so for those of us that are in states that Trump won we would really appreciate if she would be more careful and show respect to every American voter and not just the ones who voted for her okay this is what the Democrats have to do they have to disown Hillary Clinton and they do have to move to the middle this is one of the things that we saw in that pa-18 race or Connor Lam one he basically ran as a moderate Democrat and he won if Democrats run hard to the left they're gonna be in some trouble but here's the problem when it comes to the presidential candidates they want the people who are hardest to the left so Mara so mitch landrieu is the new mayor of New Orleans and he is seen as a possible successor to Hillary Clinton as the nominee in 2020 for no reason that I can discern here is Mitch Landrieu talking about American values okay this is not gonna be a winning pitch and it was fought for the cause of preserving slavery it's hard to have a racial reconciliation conversation unless we could just clearly articulate that particular truth and of course now that we see in the moment that we're in that when we're dealing with other issues whether it's immigrants whether it's transgender whoever it is that we have a closed society we're turning away from each other rather than towards each other and when you begin to judge people based on race creed call a sexual orientation a country of origin that's antithetical to what American values are this entire country is built on the idea that we treat people based on what they do not who they are okay that's all true except for the part about where he says that we don't judge people based on immigration status or transgender behavior or any of the other stuff so one of the things Democrats have had a tendency to do and this is where you get into identity politics is they have identified behavior as identity right your behavior is now your identity well if that's the case then everyone is discriminatory all of the time because we all discriminate on the basis of behavior people who you like juice things that you like people you don't like do certain things you don't like if the idea is that if they do things you don't like you're not allowed to condemn them because that is their identity then we have essentially put an end to any sort of real-life judgment you can't judge anyone because they're doing things and the things they do make them who they are in reality we are supposed to separate the actions that people take from who they are in terms of immutable characteristics so if you're a black person who's a wonderful person you're a wonderful person right the wonderful person part is that is the part that trumps any racial category right whether you're black white or green if you are but according to the left if you're a black person a bad person the black person's status overrides the bad person status because black / bi people been victimized by American society and we cannot criticize you on because of your particular race now the left is also saying that if you are for example a man who acts as a a woman right this is not in fact an aspect of behavior this is an immutable identity characteristic that if you are a man who puts on a dress this is somehow not behavior this is identity and once you start identifying behavior with identity then you can't make laws on anything because everything we do is behavior and every law that discriminates against behavior discriminates against someone's identity by that very definition and literally anything you do is now tied to your identity so if you say that my kleptomania is part of my identity so we can't have laws against stealing well then you've basically gotten rid of all thievery laws in the United States none of this is to say that there should be laws against transgender identity a transgender identification or cross-dressing or there should be laws against against you know any other form of behavior that doesn't hurt anyone else but to be clear in our own minds discrimination against identity is not the same as discrimination against behavior and conflating the two merely confuses things conflating the two is the end of law it's the end of discrimination in a good sense and it's the end of a civil society at large because we can't make judgments about anything if we can't make judgments about anything we can't live in a society together that isn't enough in and of itself a judgement it's a judgment that you can't make judgments and that's a problem because we all make judgments about each other all the time okay time for some things I like and then some things I hate and we'll do a very brief deconstruction of the culture so things I like today I have been reading Joseph's solavei chicks lonely Madoff and we're coming up on Passover I'll have some thoughts on Passover a little bit later in the week probably tomorrow during our biblical segment but this book the lonely man of faith by Joseph soloveitchik grabbed Rav salivate check also known as the robbed in the Orthodox Jewish community was the founder of yeshiva university he was the the guy who founded the idea of Torah Mada the believed that you had to learn secularly and you also had to learn in terms of Torah so this is one of the things that distinguishes the modern orthodox community from certain parts of the car ad community for example in the Orthodox community there are certain parts of the Orthodox community to think that you should only engage with the Tories you only engage inside the Jewish community the modern orthodox community suggests that you should read widely and you should learn from a lot of people not just from the Torah although the Torah is the sacrosanct and highest source of morality so solavei check this book is accessible to everybody and it's about the nature of human beings and how we are essentially dual right on the one hand we are the achievers who seek to strike out and forge your new paths as individuals on the other hand we are communal people who need a communal identity and an identity in relation to the cosmos we're not just brave warriors striking out into chaos we are also people who require a safe safe harbor of religion and a relationship with the transcendental that allows us to feel worthwhile book is a little bit of a hard read but it's it's a well worth it read Joseph's elevate check perhaps elevate check that the lonely man of faith checked that out just in time for Easter or Passover it's equally applicable actually to both it's quite clear okay other things let's see other things that I like well the US did expel 60 Russian diplomats so over the weekend the Trump administration announced that they were expelling 60 Russian diplomats after the Russians poisoned a guy in Salus Barre England can they poisoned a former spy sergey skripnikov berry England and the United States has expelled 60 Russian diplomats from our country okay that of course is is a worthwhile thing to do and it also gives the lie to the idea that Trump is not hard on Russia he says according to the according to CNN this is the most forceful action Trump has taken against Russia today well I mean we also have put on some pretty severe sanctions and armed the Ukrainian rebel the Ukrainian government against Russian backed forces so again that gives the lie to the idea that trumps just been pro-russia all the way okay time for a quick thing that I hate so the thing that I hate today it's this really really awful story there's an 85 year old woman who was murdered in France she was a Holocaust survivor and she was murdered by anti-semites in France it's just a horrifying horrifying story of course the police are saying the motive is anti-semitism they have not actually released the identities of the suspects details were sparse judicial official would only say that one of the suspects was born in 1989 one of the the one woman's son said we're really in shock I don't understand how someone could kill a woman who has no money and lives in a social housing complex her son said that one of the suspects was like a son to no land a frequent visitor who had come to her apartment the day of the fire and she was one of an estimated 7,000 French Jews rounded up in 1942 and held at the now demolished velde cycling track most of those held were later deported to Auschwitz she ended up marrying a fellow Holocaust survivor settling down in Paris and she lived there until her death it's just horrifying and again this was very much like the the murder of Sarah Hawley me who was another Orthodox Jewish issues a physicist in kindergarten teacher and choose 66 and she was thrown from a window last year by anti-semitic Muslims living in France again we don't know the identity of these particular people but the rise in anti-semitism across Europe is the absolutely frightening and Jews should leave okay they really should yeah it's it's it's a sad thing to say but I think the time for Jews to be able to live safely in Europe is once again over which demonstrates that they never again sloganeering from the folks in Europe was a bunch of crap they've allowed a bunch of folks to move in who are fully happy murdering Jews and it's it's despicable okay a quick deconstruction of the culture so today when we honor cardi B so we've already done modak yellow in which I tried to read through her glorious Robert Frost like lyrics but she actually did something that I loved okay she paid taxes and then when she paid taxes she realized hey wait a second taxes suck Sarah's cardi B in the most eloquent rip on white acts is our garbage in modern American history I mean this is better than anything since Ronald Reagan hears cardi B explaining that the government should not be taking our money okay so you know that government is taking 40% of my and Uncle Sam I want to know what you're doing with my skin tax money because you know what I'm saying like but you donate like when you donate to a kid from a foreign country they give you updates of what they do much of the nation I want to know what to do with my tax money because I'm from New York and the streets is always dirty we was voted the dirtiest city in America what is y'all doing this to rats on the trains I know you're not spending it not prison because y'all be giving there's like two underwears one jumps ooh for like five months so what is y'all doing with my key money what is you're doing with my money I want to know I want receipts I want everything I want to know what's doing with my money what is that doing with my money uncle Sonny yes cardi B yes cardi B 2024 indeed yes that correct this is the main question now cardi B will go out and vote Democrat I'm sure like all of her other friends in Hollywood because she's been told that that's what she has to do but cardi B let it be known you have worked hard for your money you've worked at girl with an E and that means that you ought to be protective of your cash because the mo government is wasting your money enormous quantities of it on things like Social Security and Medicare that you're not gonna need cuz you're super rich okay there's no reason why the government should be taking that much of your money and you're right New York is a steaming heap okay because Bill de Blasio's a garbage mayor and because they've done a terrible job keeping the upkeep in that city decent so you know like I'm gonna thank God the crime rates are still low but that's only because of the aftermath of Giuliani and Bloomberg in any case cardi B join us join the revolution okay taxes suck you know it I know it let's forge a partnership here Shapiro cardi B we can make this happen we can bridge all the gaps you can bring America together around Uncle Sam why are you taking our m effing taxes where is my effing money where the receipts I want them what the f cardi B ladies and gentlemen okay we'll be back here tomorrow with much much more plus we'll have a little bit of biblical analysis in the run-up to Easter and Passover so lots of good stuff happening we will see you then I'm Ben Shapiro this is Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer
