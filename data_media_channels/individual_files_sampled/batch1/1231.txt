investigating Apple prosecutors in France want to know why the company slows down it's older iPhones it's claimed it could be a ploy to get users to upgrade lawsuits are also underway in the u.s. so how will all of this impact on consumers trust in Apple products this is inside story hello welcome to the program I'm Adrienne Finnegan for many customers Apple and it's iPhones are the best in the business the ultimate in excellence that was until last month when the company admitted to slowing down older models it said that it was done to protect battery life but users hadn't been told some suspect that there was another motive and a u.s. senator has demanded answers from Apple CEO Tim Cook a French prosecutor has also now launched an investigation we'll get to our guests in just a moment but first Natasha Butler reports from Paris in France one in 5 smartphone users owns an iPhone each new model causes much excitement but not everyone is happy with the u.s. manufacturer a French consumer watchdog has filed a legal complaint saying Apple deliberately slows down old iPhone models to encourage customers to buy newer ones within there they are doing what we call planned obsolescence - - in the purpose - for people to buy new one if it's a marketing strategy and we think here that we have enough proof to make this lawsuit now hope says Apple uses software updates to slow down its phones the watchdog says recent updates coincided with the release of the iPhone 8 in France such a practice is illegal under French law it is a crime to deliberately shorten the life span of a product in order to try and force consumers to buy new ones those found guilty can be punished with a prison sentence a large fine and companies can be forced to pay up to 5% for their annual earnings in Paris some Apple customers welcomed the investigation Roscoe filburn idea it's important to know what's going on because we are all hostages of multinationals America wants I bought a new find that I have to charge all the time and the updates make it slower I think it's done on purpose even though it's illegal here after a flurry of similar lawsuits in the u.s. last year Apple admitted to intention he's slowing down it's old phones saying it was done to help prolong battery life some analysts say the company should have been more transparent everyone knows that their phone starts to lose power after a certain time and this is actually quite a clever way of dealing with it what's interesting is how it's being presented in rather a negative light I think that's Apple's fault for not communicating better that they were doing this to help their users al Jazeera contacted Apple in France for comment but has not received a reply faced with a criminal investigation though the stakes here for the tech giant are hi Natasha Butler al Jazeera Paris well as Natasha was saying apple says it slows down phones over time to extend battery life this is the company's statement from December 28th all rechargeable batteries become less effective as they chemically aged Apple went on to say that iOS updates aim to manage older phones to prevent unexpected battery shutdowns but there can also mean longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance as a result Apple says it will soon issue an update that gives users more visibility into the health of their iPhones battery so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance let's bring in our guest then for today's discussion from London we're joined by Glen Moody who saw in Natasha's report a technology writer and blogger he's the author of rebel code Linux and the open source revolution from Xi'an in China via Skype Wang bian a writer for tech node an english-language publication that covers China's tech industry and from New York we're joined by Dean Crutchfield a branding expert welcome to you all gentlemen Glen let's start with you then does Apple's explanation as to why they've throttled back performance on some iPhone models make technical sense does it stand up to scrutiny I think it does and there's an important point to make here which hasn't been drawn out perhaps enough people are talking about phones being slowed down and Apple has said that it does do that but only in certain circumstances for example when it's drawing excessive power from the battery so this is not about slowing down pho all the time it's about certain moments as you rightly mentioned when you launch an app when you scroll through things then you may see some slowing down so it's not true that they are slowing down their phones in general they are stopping the peak power causing problems so basically Apple's introduced a performance slowdown to mask at some times some points when you're using the phone you'll notice this slowdown to mask a deficiency in battery power the computing power of the phone hasn't changed it hasn't got any any slower I mean what are the ethics of this well I mean personally I think as I said in the excerpt they showed before that Apple has communicated this extraordinary badly they could have said and should have said we are trying to help people use their phones for longer or actually extending the life instead they made this change without telling people and that was the big mistake I think Wang by an in in Xi'an Apple has apologized for its poor handling of the issue it's cut the price of a battery replacement but if this throttling is is software control is a new battery going to restore performance to my iPhone yes yes just as you said once the new battery is replaced on to the old devices the performance will return to is you know normal standard okay this isn't then as far as you're concerned a case of programmed obsolescence as some people have suggested indeed the France taking a serious look at that issue Apple isn't deliberately slowing older phones in order to get us all to buy a new iPhone I think this is a you know this is a battery problem it's not a processor problem so the problem is about the battery once the batteries on is you know chemical ends so Apple in order to extend is left span so Apple have to stop you know slow down the the performance a little bit too you know save the battery life this is just like you know when you use a laptop they have a if you are running Windows on a laptop you have for the battery you have a three options like energy saving average and photo you know you can choose that I think this is the same function as you know in iPhone as in local yes Dean Crutchfield in New York is Apple gonna lose sales due to this negative publicity what's the fallout gonna be for the company the loss of faith a couple I suppose with the realization that a customer can replace a battery for what thirty dollars and restore performance rather than spend $1000 on a new one yeah well I mean this is not a technology issue this is not a product problem this is a this is about Apple's brand and their consumers love for that brand that their consumers trust in that brand so the the big question here is is this a close shave or a deep cut and I believe Apple is bleeding and their response so far adds to the momentum of the cut of the of the chatter that's going out there I think bezels often says a brand is what people say about you and they leave the room and there's a lot of people talking about Apple right now so this is a much bigger problem than I think they anticipate it could be I think therefore they have to be they have to behave in a way that recognizes that crisis can be like a bomb for a brand like Apple and it can actually you know create a lot of problems in terms of people's perception of that brand so it's not what you say it's what you do and here's the interesting thing if that product strategy was meant to benefit the consumer how come it wasn't communicated or conveyed in any of the collateral or any of the information that surrounds the product and there's a lot of information about it so why of consumers being duped into thinking there's something wrong with their phone it's the first major hardware issue Dean to hit the iPhone on on CEO Tim Cook's watch how much responsibility for this poor handling of the issue does he have to accept you only have one throat to choke and that's the CEO okay Glen can Apple be criticized for timing major upgrades of its operating system to coincide with the release of new phones is that it is is that ultimately behind this issue well not really in the sense it's the natural time to do it if you're launching new phones you tend to have launched new software and therefore people on the older phones want to have some of those benefits and therefore you again you could argue that they're actually doing the users a favor I mean I agree that this is really about batteries and I think it's a very important point you see I can't see how users it's a favor I just don't get it well because you're given them new features I mean when you upgrade the software on a new phone the old features slow down for some of those features their phones being slowed down so but they don't know because you'd be able to change your battery more easily that the issue is how easily you can change your battery I think Apple and other manufacturers have been at fault in not making it clear that by changing your battery more read more regularly you can actually boost the performance of your phone and they should make that easier and they should make that cheaper and so that's the really big issue here and it affects all manufacturers but Dean I mean I you know Apple has never promoted that initiative between other manufacturers just as Apple do make phones that have no user upgradeable parts unlike the old days when batteries could be removed I mean to a certain extent this is a problem of their own making isn't it absolutely I think that they've got themselves in this trouble and they need to get themselves out and the way they're reacting right now is slow it's very corporate it's very self-interested they're taking a 50,000 foot view and they've got to get down to 5 foot where the consumer is and how frustrated that consumer really is thinking about Apple that's a major problem they've got to get down to the consumer level and understand how they're feeling Dean what would be the implications for Apple if they lost any of the class-action lawsuits currently filed against it on this issue or or even if it was found guilty of planned obsolescence in in France where it as we were hearing earlier it's illegal yeah well I think it would have very detriment on their brand in a very detrimental impact on their wallet but their wallets pretty big here the bigger issue is their brand reputation that is as we know worth billions of dollars and that could be impacted by this debacle so really they need to be very mindful of that that the success of Apple isn't because of the company it's because of their consumer that loves the Apple products and here we're hearing that the the actual Apple products have been slowed down without consumers knowing so I think that makes it rather opaque and I think you know the other the other guests here we are looking at Apple to being more transparent what I want to hear is hide nothing tell all what's been going on here and why have you been doing it this way Brennan do you want to respond to that but but I absolutely agree I'm a great fan of transparency and I think if this leads to Apple and all manufacturers being more transparent then that would be a tremendous gain for the consumers because they will see what's going on in the devices which they own at the moment Apple and other companies are treated almost as if you don't own the device and you just sort of get it by by favour of the company so we need more transparency and we need something there's a movement called right to repair you should have a right to repair the things that you buy and that means putting in new batteries putting your new screens at the moment Apple and other companies make that very hard and I think that's got to change and I would avoid a lot of these kind of problems one by Anne you've been very patient so I know I know you want to come in on this did you want to respond to what you've heard yeah speaking of transparency I think you know I since starting from 2008 I was you know begin to beginning to use MacBook running like Mac OS there's a beauty enter inside the MacBook you know to indicate the users if there are batteries health is unhealthy I always need to be replaced I think the iOS is just lack of dysfunction is this is it it's nice the transparency you know is indicator inside iOS and tell people if your battery is you know affecting your whole performance on your phone and your battery maybe you need to be replaced yeah I think that's what transparency on this device on this consumer product samsung has a 2 year warranty on all of its smartphone batteries it is 2 years what you'd expect a smartphone battery to last you know if if the battery can be replaceable you know no matter from you know yourself are from the consumer you know the consumer services I think yeah 2 years is it's a good life span for a normal battery yes cleaner should people who've spent $1000 on a new iPhone X expect to experience similar performance issues in two years from now as the battery in their devices ages I think you probably can because it's in the nature of this technology if you think about it it's pretty crazy we've got a a lump of metal which stores electricity inside your phone it's a miracle it works at all so I don't think there's any way to guarantee that it won't happen for however advanced the technology but one thing I would say is that I think people need to start asking do they really need to upgrade because they've got these amazingly powerful pieces of technology in their pocket so there are effectively super computers in their pockets why do they keep needing to upgrade and it's obviously partly to do with the kind of Apple magic but maybe society needs to start asking do we need to have this upgrade cycle teen it's it's obvious that consumers are pretty angry about this issue however we don't expect our cars to go on forever without seeing some sort of drop in in performance so why should we expect our phones to do so yes we know with a car you get it you get a warranty you get a feel you get a 20,000 mile a hundred thousand mile 150 thousand mile warranty it's proactively offered to you to have your car as it were upgraded or check to make sure it's still working and all the back lights are working so it offers it do Samsung offers you a two-year warranty what we have here is Apple offering nothing and including no information about the very fact that it exists so that's the issue it's opaque they need to become transparent this issue will force transparency because customers are going to be clamoring for them to be more open and to be more transparent and the fact is all this litigation that's going to be coming against them is going to force also to be more transparent what is their next step what are they gonna offer beyond a cheap a battery replacement where's the warranties where's all that information and where's that offer Klien $1,000 is a major investment for most people I mean our consumers naive to expect you know their phones to last more than 24 months to still feel brand new after two years well as you say it's a lot of money but the technology is amazing but I think they do need to think whether they need to upgrade it or whether it's good enough I mean personally I don't upgrade my phone I haven't upgraded one for five or six years because it does everything I need and why do people upgrade I mean if they need it it's good money it's worth spending but if they don't then as you say it's a lot of money and what are they going to get for it Dean it is Apple a victim of its own marketing here I mean consumers are buying into Apple's premium quality and brand status therefore they expect the exceptional and here we have Apple facing a crisis that it appears not to know how to deal with exactly I think that you know this is this is they're taking a very corporate stance that's showing lots of self-interest in terms of protecting themselves and protecting their business strategy and that's the accusation is this a deliberate business strategy with obsolescence in these phones that will make people perceive the need to buy a new phone because they don't know what's actually happening with it caused by Apple so to me it's a crisis management situation they're not handling it very well the top line of any crisis is hide nothing tell all and guess what they've been hiding this for ages and they haven't been telling us about it so it's it's a really massive flaw in their response that they've been caught short and the very fact that they're doing these reactionary issues like cheaper battery replacements in a sense is acceptance of guilt so let's and those that will be picked on by those people who have looking to take them to court all right so let's imagine you we were speaking to Tim Cook right now that we had him on the program what would you say to him I would say to him that you've got to you but I like to call it a prep strategy you know what's the purpose of the you of why you were doing this you've said that was the reason was it for you was it for the consumer was it for the phone let me understand that give me some examples you know whether it's iPhone 4 iPhone 6 what are we talking about here and then get back to the purpose of Apple wanting to satisfy its consumers and to do everything it can to make that satisfaction to deliver it so I think that's what they need to do but clearly hide nothing tell all is going to be very awkward for them because of the situation legally where they don't want to be accepting too much because of the implications that has for the court of the court of public opinion likely coming back with a guilty verdict claim would you would you agree with that I mean what would your advice to Tim Cook be well yeah I certainly do agree that transparency has to be the way forward and I would also urge him to be proactive in letting people do what they want with their own equipment this idea they have a right to repair if Apple could espouse that and say look we're on your side we believe that you do have the right to repair things as you wish then I think that that would help to forge stronger bonds with its customers and I think other manufacturers need to do the same hopefully we could see a very competitive situation whereby more and more manufacturers who have bend over backwards to make it easy for their customers to do this kind of thing because that way they have a far better handle on what's happening with their equipment and also that have the options to repair things between Apple is a very wealthy company is it too focused on profit do you think well I think that you know it's it's an amazingly oiled machine it does extraordinarily well it has analysts and shareholders to answer to and therefore most corporations are tied to their shareholder returns but apples always being positioned to be loved by its consumer so I think we have a question here where that could be challenged that basic idea of trust the idea of this excellence product excellence and marketing excellence and brand excellence suddenly we're seeing the veneer crack and people are able to peer behind that and there's some stuff down there that we're not we don't like looking at and it doesn't look that good and this is exactly that so to a Glenn's point the the idea of transparency and more flexibility in people maintaining their product I think already here that ships already left they're just got have to catch up with it and get on board because there's no way we're going back we're going forward now and the customers going to demand that transparency and they're going to be demanding clear product strategies when they buy their next phone in terms of the warranty battery replacement etc they want it to be honest and transparent and Apple has not been won't buy out would you agree with that this is is this a pivotal moment for Apple I mean it is the number one brand most phone users in the world turn to the most expense expensive brand to buy you know people would like to assume that they're buying safe in the knowledge of quality and longevity does Apple need to change you know from the history of shark is very effective you know in the Apple like most products has flaws you know the interrogate from Michael for the been engage from echo 6 you know even the best-selling Apple products have this loss but you know a for the product for the battery gauge so-called battery game they have a conversation like you know they provided bargain battery price I think that is their you know their core value yeah clean many of us are iPhone uses a lot of us are bugged by the fact that our iPhones aren't running as quickly as they as they used to what are we to do what would your advice be I mean it's it's one thing about getting the battery replace there are five people in my household that's going to cost us a lot of money to get our batteries upgraded or replaced do we do we wait do we do we buy new phones what do we do what's your advice I would advise yes of grading the battery I think it's the simplest and most effective way of getting better performance and there's another reason why Apple and the other manufacturers should be offering batteries as cheaply as possible because it is the easiest way to get better performance from your products the fact that they try and turn it into a profit Center I think is unacceptable because they shouldn't be price gouging people for something that should be a basic sort of necessity for upgrading your product do you know I asked you about your advice for Apple what about your advice to Apple consumers then what would you what would the people who perhaps I mean obviously take a stand I think yeah Trust has been look Trust is clearly being eroded here you know when there's a problem with a Toyota car as we've seen and the kill function in bolts wagons cars you took your car in and you got a free upgrade you didn't have to spend any money on that correction that they made a problem with it they admitted they fixed it here's a situation where deliberately apples been slowing down people's phones they've been perceiving this not being right to me is it is it enough to reduce the cost of the battery replacement or should you be obliged just to replace it if the customer so wishes I think it's gonna get to that point where there's an expectation I shouldn't be paying you for a battery replacement because you've never made it clear in your collateral that that's something I would need to do so now that I am aware of that and it's been a deliberate strategy on your part you need to be responsible for that and I don't think I should pay for that replacement all right gentleman there I'm afraid we're gonna have to leave it thank you all for being with us Glen Moody won't buy an and Dean Crutchfield as always thank you for watching don't forget you can see the program again at any time just by going to the website at
