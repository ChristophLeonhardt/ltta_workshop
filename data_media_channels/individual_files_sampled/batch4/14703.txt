we are the anti far you know one of my favorite things to talk about is pop culture especially comics particularly diversity in comics now some progressives out there want new diverse superheroes but I've always figured why bother when you can just steal spider-man and make him biracial give Thor sex change and make her punch bad guys for using feminists like it's a four-letter word but I've been thinking there's still one super oppressed group that Marvel and DC Comics ignore and that's me and Tifa but not for long my buddy Marc Bray a history professor at Dartmouth is writing the intro for this badass new ante foe comic book yeah dude look at this totally awesome cover art do you know how much courage it takes to isolate and swarm our enemies and surprise attacks and run away right at the small sign of resistance I mean black outfit vigilante justice I'm the modern-day Batman and I deserve to be treated as such I just really hope Marc Bray donates half of the revenue he makes from this comic book to an Tifa like he did with the anti-fascist handbook last year I mean all I knows I could use it my Indigenous Studies degree isn't much help landing a job anyway the book will be coming out in September and I want to point you to one part of its Amazon description fascism poisonous roots have taken holes in every region of the world from its beginnings in post-world War one Italy through Nazi Germany Stalin's Soviet Union Franco's Spain in the KKK in America that's right both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were fascist and when you hear that you should think right-wing not communism not National Socialism right-wing like feminist author Grace Lee Boggs said history is not the past it is the stories we tell about the past and in my story when I don't like something I've learned it's best to say Nazi or far-right until it's dealt with by college administrators or uncle George so yeah I'll be buying this antique a comic book with the slick $18 from my welfare check take it out America and you should too to support Brae in the main author and gord Hill who goes by the nickname zig zag in our anti-capitalist movement don't worry that Bray can't even define fascism and hesitates to confine it to an abstract analytical definition the end justifies the means so get out there grab a bat and start slugging away and burning things like the superhero you are just make sure you say tolerance diversity or something right beforehand for each side and Tifa this is Robson Shaw if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send this details using the forum on campus unmask calm you
