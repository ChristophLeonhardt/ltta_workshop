(dramatic music)
(thunder rumbles)
- Hurricane Maria hit us hard.
Our solar panels and house survived,
but the whole system collapsed.
I needed cash, but the banks were closed,
and credit cards were just plastic.
(bright music)
A friend in Missouri told me,
"Why don't I send you money
through Western Union?"
Shortly after the devastation
from Hurricane Maria,
Western Union sent a plane
of cash to Puerto Rico.
Gracias.
Now I could begin helping my neighbors.
There will be other other storms,
but we'll be ready to
weather them, together.
