>> Neil: ALL RIGHT, THERE COMES
A POINT WHERE A LOT OF FOLKS SAY
YOU KEEP TAXING ME TO DEATH I AM
SO OUT OF HERE.
"WALL STREET JOURNAL" THAT SAYS
HIGH-TECH STATES LIKE NEW YORK
AND CALIFORNIA ARE FEELING IT.
IF THE TREND IS ANY INDICATION,
OVER 800,000 COULD BOLT FROM
THOSE RESPECTIVE STATES SIMPLY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TAXED TO
DEATH AND HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL
TO MOVE ELSEWHERE.
THEY WILL.
COMMENTATOR AND DEMOCRATIC
STRATEGIST CHUCK ROCHA.
>> I'M LIVING PROOF OF THAT,
THAT I'M ONE OF THOSE WHO LEFT
CALIFORNIA AND MOVED TO FLORIDA
FOR PRECISELY SOME OF THE
REASONS YOU'RE STATING, NEIL.
I TALK TO PEOPLE EVERY DAY WHO
HAVE DONE THE EXACT SAME THING
WHO ARE NOW LIVING HERE IN
FLORIDA AND MOVED FROM NEW YORK
OR CALIFORNIA.
>> Neil: CHUCK, IT'S STARTING IN
A LOT OF OTHER PLACES, A LOT OF
STATES THAT HAVE THESE,
BEAUTIFUL, CALIFORNIA IS
BEAUTIFUL, LOTS OF PARTS OF
NEW YORK, THIS WONDERFUL CITY.
AND A LOT OF POLITICIANS RALLY
AROUND THE IDEA WHO WOULD WANT
TO LEAVE.
APARENTALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE DO,
THEY'RE TAXED TO HELL, RIGHT?
>> I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD SAY THE
OPEN SIS, I MOVED FROM TEXAS
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A STATE INCOME
TAX TO WASHINGTON D.C. THAT
TAXES MY INCOME 9.9%.
BUT LOOK AT THE OVERALL NUMBERS.
EXACTLY RIGHT IN NEW YORK AND
CALIFORNIA.
BULLS IT'S BEEN GOING ON -- BUT
IT'S BEEN GOING ON 20 TO 30
YEARS, LOSING CONGRESSIONAL
SEATS BECAUSE THE POPULATIONS
ARE MOVING OUT OF OLDER AREAS
LIKE NEW YORK AND NEW ENGLAND
AND CONNECTICUT.
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS WHAT
YOU TALK ABOUT WITH CALIFORNIA,
THERE'S A NEWER POPULATION
THERE, AND YOU START TO SEE A
MIKE GRAGS INTO ARIZONA, AND --
MIGRATION INTO ARIZONA, NEVADA,
OR IT COULD BE PEOPLE GETTING
OLDER AND WANTING TO GO WHERE IT
DON'T RAIN SO MUCH.
>> Neil: COULD BE THAT.
BUT THERE'S A POINT WHERE PEOPLE
MAYBE IN THOSE STATES AND MAYBE
COULD TO BLAME IN THE HIGH TAX
STATES WHERE THEY CAN'T WRITE
OFF AS MUCH UNDER THE NEW PLAN.
WHOEVER FAULT IT IS, IT IS REAL,
IT'S PAL POSSIBLE.
THE HIGH STATE TAXES SHOULD BE
CONCERNED.
>> BECAUSE THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY ISN'T SUPPLEMENTING THE
OVERSPENDING STATES LIKE
CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK DOESN'T
MAKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT
TO PAY THE OTHER STATE TACKS TO
BE AT FAULT.
IF YOU LOCK AT THIS NEIL, IT'S A
FORCE, GOING TO FORCE BLUE
STATES TO LOOK AT REDUCING THEIR
TAXES.
THAT'S REALLY WHERE THEY ARE.
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THAT.
THEY WANT TO PLAY THE BLAME
GAME.
BUT I DON'T THINK IT BOTH WELL.
>> Neil: I DON'T SO THAT
HAPPENING.
I'M A NEW JERSEY RESIDENT, THE
GOVERNOR WANTS TO COME DOWN ON
FOLKS AND THE WRITEOFFS, BUT
MAYBE THAT'S JUST NEW JERSEY.
>> AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, MOVING
AROUND OF THE TAXES.
JUST THE TAX REDUCTION THAT
HAPPENED.
A LOT OF LIKE EVEN WHEN YOU CUT
BACK ON THE TAXES ARC LOT WAS
DIVERTED TO THE STATES NO,
LONGER GOING TO THE STATES.
YOU SEE THESE STATES HIKING UP
THEIR RATES MAKING UP FOR THE
DIFFERENCES WHEN THEY SHOULD BE
CUTTING BUDGETS.
THAT COULD BE A BIG PART OF IT,
AS A DEMOCRAT, THAT'S NOT ALL OF
IT.
ALL OF IT HAS A STAIR STEP MULTI
LAYERED APPROACH TO THIS.
THAT'S THE REASON IT'S
HAPPENING.
>> Neil: I KNOW THE BIGGEST AND
LOOMING ECONOMIES, STATES, ARE
TO THE POINT, HE WAS THE ONLY
PERSON WHO MOVED OUT OF TEXAS.
I'M KIDDING.
THEY TEND TO SEEK OUT LOW TAX
ENVIRONMENTS.
THE BOOMING STATES ARE THOSE
THAT HAVE IT.
>> AND YOU SEE THE PEOPLE FOR A
LONG TIME, NEW YORK CITY, IF YOU
GO INTO POLITICS IN FLORIDA,
THERE'S A GENERATION, MU TY
LAYER GENERATION WHO MOVED FROM
NEW YORK TO FLORIDA.
I DO CAMPAIGNS THERE ALL THE
NAME.
>> Neil: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING,
YOU WILL SEEK OUT THE LEAST
RESISTANCE.
MONEY, REGULATION, TAXES, RIGHT?
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SOLE
REASON.
>> 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE
ALREADY MADE THAT EXODUS.
WE EXPECT A LOT MORE.
STEVE MOORE SAID ANOTHER 800,000
ARE TO LEAVE.
I BELIEVE THOSE ESTIMATES.
AND I'M SEEING THIS EVERY SINGLE
DAY.
I TALK TO THESE PEOPLE.
THE SCARIEST PART OF THIS FOR
THE BLUE STATES, NEIL, IT IS THE
JOB CREATORS.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE HIT THE
HARDEST BY THE OVERTAXING OF THE
BLUE STATES.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAKE DEG
