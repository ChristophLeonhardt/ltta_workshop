I watched the movie Marshall last night about Thurgood Marshall the movie was really good it was so so good and as anything pertaining to America our founding our tribulations our growth I cried like a baby now a lot of people equate Thurgood Marshall to liberalism because of his profound impact on the civil rights movement but I think at his ideological core he actually was a conservative I mean we all know who voted against the civil rights movements both the civil rights movement of the 1860s and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 LBJ proposed the bill but it was passed by Republicans once the Democrats finally decided to stop filibustering it after all it's the Democrats who fought to stop the 13th 14th and 15th amendments but that's a topic for another day anyway in light of watching that incredibly inspiring movie which I absolutely recommend by the way and on the flip side witnessing such disgusting acts as the South Carolina n-double-a-cp president lying about treatment he received from cop I have a story that will warm your heart and I think we need that with racial divisions and political hysteria in this country and the ugliness rising to what seems to be new heights every single day stories like this one give us a short respite from the unremitting divisive news cycle a young man a black man from Houston Texas is being hailed as a hero by his community Louis Jordan works a full day shift almost every single day at UPS and then he goes to pick up his mother in downtown Houston one day last month and unbearably hot Texas day he noticed an elderly woman sitting in a wheelchair waiting for her transit bus in the Blazing Sun he went to his car and grabbed his umbrella from his trunk and went over to her and used the umbrella to shield her from the Sun they waited and they waited and they waited apparently public transit wasn't operating efficiently that day imagine that a government armed not working properly anyway while they were waiting they began chatting Jordan's mother took a photo while she was waiting in the car photo went absolutely viral the elderly woman's name is Michelle and the two of them her and Lewis Jordan have struck up a friendship since their first meeting any time Jordan sees her waiting for the bus he goes over to chat with his new friend he told Houston's ABC affiliate that he's learned that she is in a book club and she loves pork chops something that they have in common I mean bonding over food is always a good thing if we could only ever talk about food I think we would all get along better unless you try to tell me that Memphis barbecue is better than Alabama barbecue then we're gonna have a problem but the next time someone steps up to you and tries to bait you in a political argument maybe just ask them what they like on their tacos oh wait that's probably cultural appropriation never mind you can't win anyway everybody have a great day thanks for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at WWWE of forward slash shows follow us on Facebook and Twitter for all of our latest news and download our new awesome awesome app for the rebel media on the App Store that way you will have easy and instant access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
