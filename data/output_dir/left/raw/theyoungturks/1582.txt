39
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,489
scared to do something like that

40
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,160
I think I could do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> too like a can</font>

41

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> draught beer or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

42
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,090
but but an ar-15 I think I'd be way too

43
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,440
freaked out to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about you</font>

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,390
see it was very very impressive<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

48
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely can't handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ar-15 so I like</font>

49
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,910
her passion I like what she stands for

50
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's exactly what we need</font>

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for whiny liberals</font>

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,400
owners<font color="#CCCCCC"> and who understand guns and who</font>

decided to wreck that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ar-15 which you</font>

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
know if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever do have a buyback</font>

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,190
program you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna miss out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on some</font>

65
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">cash so that was very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> noble of you</font>

66
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">in many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways so so let's unpack that</font>

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">issue first before we really get into</font>

68
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the anatomy of your campaign why are you</font>

69
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,160
a gun the owner who dislikes the NRA

70
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I've never liked the NRA because</font>

71
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,540
they are for the gun manufacturers

72
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,519
they're not for gun owners<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's their</font>

73
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,299
sole purpose yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're everything</font>

74
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they do inhibits common sense gun</font>

75
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,040
reform<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's all not for them so</font>

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,489
what is from your perspective then

77
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">common sense gun reform well what is</font>

78
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,420
some

79
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you would</font>

80
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,069
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see well we need universal</font>

81
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,250
background checks<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need for the CDC to</font>

82
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,170
study<font color="#CCCCCC"> gun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> violence and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how it escalated</font>

83
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,550
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> no country we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ban those bump</font>

84
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">stocks here in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Virginia we tried to do</font>

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,870
it and couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even get it out of</font>

86
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we need to also be in</font>

87
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-capacity magazines</font>

88
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,339
military-style assault weapons<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

89
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">to expand the National instant criminal</font>

90
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:21,230
background system<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple</font>

91
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">of pieces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legislation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been</font>

92
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,040
that I support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't even get out</font>

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,729
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee</font>

94
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:30,740
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully once I'm a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> congresswoman we</font>

95
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,389
can get that done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

96
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah I mean it's one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those issues</font>

97
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">where when you really have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

98
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,150
conversation it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's so</font>

99
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,040
many just<font color="#CCCCCC"> common-sense things we could</font>

100
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,380
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know an interest group</font>

101
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the NRA pretty much prohibits that</font>

102
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,540
conversation so let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

103
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,790
campaign you've been in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the race</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

104
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,520
months and now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a a more</font>

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,050
centrist candidate that the DNC

106
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,870
appointed against you so tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

107
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,370
that well I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced August</font>

108
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,460
the 20th right<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I was going to run and</font>

109
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,050
before that in July<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went out to visit</font>

110
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Emily's list and try to go see the</font>

111
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,930
d-triple-c<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when I got there that</font>

112
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,580
Emily's letter said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the d-triple-c</font>

113
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,200
had already hand-picked their candidate

114
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they didn't want to meet with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

115
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">even before that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they picked someone</font>

116
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">else and then both of those men one of</font>

117
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,830
them never<font color="#CCCCCC"> even ran the state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> senator</font>

118
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,780
and then the other man dropped out so

119
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">after it was November when we had the</font>

120
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">blue wave here in Virginia and I got a</font>

121
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,070
phone call<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the woman that's running</font>

122
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,020
against me in the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she told</font>

123
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,270
me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the d-triple-c had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recruited her</font>

124
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,470
to run and when I went up there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> July</font>

125
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one question they asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me was can</font>

126
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">you raise a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand dollars in</font>

a week you know in your rolodex or

128
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,860
whatever and I'm like no because

129
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,849
everybody I know is teachers you know

130
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,980
welders mechanics and

was how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all began</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font>

134
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,600
before I announced on August 20th<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had</font>

135
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,910
a text message from someone higher up in
