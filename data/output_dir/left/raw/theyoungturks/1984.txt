1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,690
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THE
BOSTON GLOBE DECIDED THEY WERE

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,200
GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
FUN.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,859
NOW, MIND YOU, TWO YEARS

4
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,730
AGO AS APRIL 10, 2016, AND
THAT'S WHEN THEY RAN THIS.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,730
AT

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,570
THAT POINT TRUMP HASN'T WON THE
PRESIDENCY YET, EVERYONE STILL

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,101
THINKS HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN THE
PRESIDENCY, BUT HE OBVIOUSLY HAS

8
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:23,211
HAD SOME FIERY RHETORIC ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL, SO THEY DID A

9
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,060
MOCKUP OF WHAT THE BOSTON GLOBE
COULD LOOK LIKE UNDER THE TRUMP

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,220
PRESIDENCY.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,070
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
IT, HERE'S THE TWEET THAT BEGINS

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,070
TO EXPLAIN IT, THEY SAY --

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,070
>>

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:41,610
>>THEY TELL YOU TO LOOK AT THE
DATE AND ALL THE HEADLINES

15
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,530
BECAUSE THE FIRST TOP HEADLINE
IN THE PARODY IS DEPORTATIONS TO

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,530
BEGIN.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,410
WELL, THEY HAVE.

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,830
LET'S
LOOK AND SEE IF THEY GOT THE

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,840
REST RIGHT.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,480
NEW LIBEL LAW
TARGETS AND SALUTES COME IN THE

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,969
PRESS -- WELL, THAT'S PRETTY
CLOSE TO WHAT IS HAPPENING.

22
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:01,969
U.S.

23
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,550
SOLDIERS REFUSE ORDERS TO KILL
ISIS FAMILIES.

24
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,020
IN FACT WE JUST

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,540
HAD A STORY LEFT WEEK WHERE THE
GENERALS WERE SHOWING A DRONE

26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:19,120
STRIKE TO DONALD TRUMP AND THEY
SHOWED HIM THE TARGET LEAVING

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,050
HIS HOUSE WHERE HIS FAMILY WAS,
AND THEN THEY KILLED HIM AND

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,860
THEY SAID THAT WAS TO AVOID
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, AND DONALD

29
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,480
TRUMP SAID, WHY DID YOU WAIT?

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,130
IN
OTHER WORDS, WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL

31
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,250
THE FAMILY MEMBERS?

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,400
SO THAT'S AT
LEAST 3-FOR-3, LET ALONE THERE

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,340
WAS ANOTHER PART OF THE HEADLINE
THAT SAID MARKETS SINK AS TRADE

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,540
WAR LOOMS.

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,780
MAINLY REVOLVING
AROUND MEXICO IN CHINA.

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
THAT'S

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
4-FOR-4.

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,030
MAN, DID THEY
UNFORTUNATELY GET THIS RIGHT,

39
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,460
AND TWO YEARS LATER IT IS NO
LONGER A PARODY, IT'S THE SAD

40
00:01:57,460 --> 00:00:00,000
FARCE THAT WE ALL LIVE IN.
