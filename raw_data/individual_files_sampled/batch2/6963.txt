President Trump was talking about how the stock market is doing well under his watch that part is actually true and I'm gonna show you numbers on that in a minute but then he of course he couldn't help himself and said something absolutely preposterous let me show it to you and then we'll break it down watch I'm so proud of the five point two trillion dollars of increase in the stock market now if you look at the stock market that's one element but then we have many other elements the country we took it over a toe 20 trillion as you know the last eight years they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country so they borrowed more than ten trillion dollars right and yet we picked up five point two trillion just in the stock market possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months in terms of value so you could say in one sense we're really increasing values and maybe in a sense we're reducing debt but we're very honored by it no wait a minute the stock market has nothing to do with the federal government's budget what do you mean in a sense you're reducing debt that's not remotely true so let's even CNBC reporting on this was like CNBC which loves to support basically the pro corporate position wrote while it's true that the US stock market indexes have risen markedly during Trump's time in office the current gains are part of a bull market that began in the spring of 2009 when the country began there to recover from the Great Recession and the collapse of the housing market so first let's tackle that issue and then we'll get to what in the world he's talking about when it comes to the deficit and the debt so I'm gonna show you a graph now of how the stock market is done since 2009 and you will see that where that line is the dotted line near the end that's when Trump takes office so you can see that since he has taken office is true the market has gone up if you ignore the rest of the chart which shows a super obvious trend where the market went skyrocketing under President Obama let me give you the exact numbers on that now from Election Day 2016 to August the sp500 has gained nearly 14 percent nice job now I don't know that I agree with either Democrat so Republicans the president is responsible for that certainly not solely responsible there are a lot of factors at play but I think that you know if there is something to be said especially over eight years how did the president do in shepherding the economy and accordingly have the market go and by the way the stock market is not the only indication wages are way too depressed so I don't want to give Obama too much credit either for how the stock market did but so Trump gets some credit for the 14% growth during Obama's eight years in office as Forbes explains the S&P 500 returned two hundred and thirty five percent growth so fourteen percent two hundred and thirty five percent now that's over eight years of two hundred thirty five percent the fourteen percent over nine months I'm giving you the full context but if Trump let's take credit for how well the markets doing now he should have given all of the credit in the world to Obama for the eight years where the stock market absolutely boomed under Obama now you could also say hey wait that's not fair cuz it crashed right before Obama took office yeah it crashed because he had george w bush in office another republican who had the stock market go up for a little while and then crater because of his policies and that actually was because of his policies that was financial deregulation which to be fair started under clinton and ii was on steroids under bush and led to the collapse okay so but that's actually the the smaller issue here the much larger issue is wait a minute the stock market has nothing to do with the federal budget so even CNBC here clarifies many were scratching their heads at trump's implication the debt was lessening because markets are increasing in value well that's right you would be scratching your head because that makes no sense at all so now if Trump said hey look if the market does well in the economy does well eventually that'll lead to increased revenue which eventually could reduce our debt depending on other factors look even if you didn't give all those caveats and said oh this is gonna help the debt later you could make a case for it you could make a case for it but to say hey there's five point two trillion dollars of the market went up so you can say that our deficit is five point two trillion dollars Lord no no you cannot say that not in any sense what is the market of companies I have to explain this because he's like an eighth grader I'm sorry third grader I think that my second grade son would understand this easier but anyway what is the markets that is related to companies and their stock prices and their relative value the other is the federal budget that is how much the government has spent and how much it is taken in it is affected by the economy but has nothing to do with those companies if the companies make more money that doesn't mean that our debt is God it goes down by the same amount no it's not true it's not remotely true the guy doesn't understand anything I mean I look every single day he comes out and does something else where you go no he couldn't have possibly said that he couldn't have possibly meant that no rational human beings thinks that well that's because he's not a rational human being this child has no sense of how the economy works or how the government works we got to get him out he said absolute danger a guy that doesn't understand the markets to that degree you think he can't do something wrong that would then collapse the markets I know you think no no no everything's gonna be fine and everybody the markets are like Oh high five everybody every is getting trillions of dollars in tax cuts and they keep on going up the market has not correctly priced how stupid the president is he is going to make a monumental mistake I know that you can't wait for your tax ruts in your deregulation but at some point a guy this out-of-control this ignorant will make a terrible terrible mistake that'll cost us all including the markets that's my guess and I hope to god that I'm wrong qit membership gets you commercial free young turks
