to be honest theme<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael easily isn't</font>

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,379
exactly a bad thing what's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,020
biggest news was that I didn't get into

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,020
Oxford but I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really given what</font>

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,850
itself any time to process that yet

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,110
because I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got other things to</font>

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,660
deal with right now that don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,949
include going with the fact that I

23
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,420
didn't get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> university if we want</font>

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,050
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for for a big long amount of</font>

25
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,399
time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that I'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about ABS</font>

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,500
not if there's a Ned going to be honest

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm really happy that people going</font>

that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got in really well with the</font>

30
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,810
necessity for my school you just really

31

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,560
hard so because they're so good and

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,880
they'll have such an amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> time last</font>

importantly stressing over it there are

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,750
other universities the world but I hope

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,930
forget inches off me angry where else I

39
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,360

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,530
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ones picked to be</font>

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,110
featured on site many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends and</font>

46
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,790
many people whose videos are<font color="#E5E5E5"> handsome</font>

47
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,250
before but who right now I'm subscribe

48
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,350
to and the who berated amazing charities

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,570
that I have found out so much about and

50
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,860
on that day I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched so many</font>

51
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,780
videos I still haven't picked which one

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,939
of them only more money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but um I</font>

53
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,600
watched so many that I was really

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,939
touching and where so many videos

55
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,250
especially by people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean and</font>

56
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,050
culture project of this beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoodie</font>

57
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,550
that made everyone cry when we were

58
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">watching it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> John was doing blog TV at</font>

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,740
the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean poster net and we all</font>

60
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of stopped were like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy manic</font>

61
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,910
typing and competent to just watch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

62
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,730
were all blubbering it was wonderful but

63
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,620
i'm watching that video can be featured

64
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,250
because it has copyright and stuff that

65
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">would run the risk of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> children having to</font>

66
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,330
take the video down which should just be

67
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,460
awful because it's a beautiful video so

68
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put a link to it and you</font>

can watch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a worm putting links to</font>

70
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,790
things be careful because there's one on

twitter whose user name is the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

113
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,690
not have Woolworths

today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> closing down and that's</font>

115
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,230
variant had a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a tip with</font>

116
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">my dad in the car about discounting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mo</font>

117
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,340
and chains and everything because I

118
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">think working in the independent part of</font>

119
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,150
the scepter you realize just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how huge</font>

120
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,250
and ruthless these companies are and

121
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,630
it's a special circle because they're

122
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,050
all going and applying these huge big

123
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,810
discounts that no independent retailer

124
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,760
can really match up to losing out on

125
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,900
Willis profit and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

126
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,100
destroying themselves and they end up

127
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,090
with huge amounts of debts and

128
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,220
eventually have to get either managed

129
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,090
somehow to be bought or they just have

130
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to close down and so many people these</font>

131
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">their jobs it's really really sad but I</font>

132
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,960
think it says quite a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

133
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,410
priorities when we shop if we care so

134
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,120
much about discounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the price and</font>

135
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">with bindings for the price but rather</font>

136
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,920
than for what they are that these shops

137
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,740
end up not existing anymore and we won't

138
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the choice and they'll be less</font>

139
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,150
competition and I don't know it's it's

140
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,220
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird time right now but very</font>

141
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,990
interesting to graph and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think but I'm</font>

142
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,100
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> grateful that I'm going to</font>

143
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">university for the next few years</font>

144
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,020
hopefully and in a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that doesn't</font>

145
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,300
really directly affect me in the same

146
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,430
way that it would if I had to go and get

147
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,919
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> job right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is horrible you</font>

148
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,590
know redundancies that just keep

149
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,770
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah it's it's reside but</font>

150
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,560
on a happier note of stuff for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas</font>

151
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,910

157
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,410
would have to be in Doctor Who series

princess stories I started reading it

174
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,570

<font color="#E5E5E5">she's a bad miss character if anyone</font>

178
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,790
doesn't know that she's a normal New

179
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,480
York girl who is in it pretty much the

180
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,070
biggest freaking school you know not

181
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,680
hugely attractive not perfect she finds

182
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,330
out that she's a princess and she has

183
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,370
that go princess lessons with this

184
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,260
horrible old woman who's actually her

185
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,600
grandmother and her dad is like this

186
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,430
huge flirt and her<font color="#CCCCCC"> mom's going out with</font>

189
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,830
few books my favorite and then there

190
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,810
were some points I think after book<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

191
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,550
did it kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of started going a bit</font>

192
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,960
downhill for me just because I didn't

193
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,670
like a particular no corn eating

194
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,340
character all that much but the tenth

195
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,320
book is just it's a perfect ending to

196
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,180
already and it's been two years since

197
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,780
he's since mia has written so you feel

198
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,830
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's really matured a lot and</font>

199
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,880
while there was still some moments when

200
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was like oh come on Mia don't be</font>

201
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,840
ridiculous it's so obvious what's

202
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,480
happening doing such a child shut up and

203
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,580
just hit yourself as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a head with your</font>

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,500
diary because you're being ridiculous in

205
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,080

209
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,810
