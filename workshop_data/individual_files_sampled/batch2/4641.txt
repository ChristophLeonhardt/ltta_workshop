but let's begin with Kendall a nyan can eight counts guilty ten counts mistrial walk me through what more do we have on the the ten counts that there wasn't a consensus and what's gonna happen next well first I'll tell you Chuck that Paul Manafort showed no reaction he was stone-faced nor did his wife after the verdict prosecutor shook hands with one another and the judge admonished the jury that they did not have to talk to the press in the wake of this in this verdict but look prosecutors got a little of everything here not not a hundred percent victory obviously for the prosecution but they got five counts of tax fraud they got one count of failing to file a foreign bank account report and two counts of bank fraud and it appeared that this jury meticulously went through the details of the evidence and they appear to have latched on to two of the stronger bank fraud charges where there documental lies introduced into evidence in one case Paul Manafort doctored a profit and loss statement to defraud a bank to get loans at a time where he was badly in need of cash so this jury was super thoughtful it appears about their deliberations and earlier today they told the judge that they were unable to reach consensus on it turns out a number of counts the judge asked them to go back and deliberate they tried for about four hours were unable to do it and so the judge declared a mistrial in the ten counts now the government can retry Paul Manafort on those 10 counts but he's facing a lot of years in prison already on the eight count that he's been convicted of and he's facing as you know Chuck another trial in Washington DC next month that carries even more prison time well Daniel Goldman let me go to you and not just because you're standing next to Ken but so explain this to me if you're the prosecutor you happy since is this feel like a solid win look you know it's not a resounding victory but it is a definite victory and in particular for the reason that Ken said because the jury somewhat unusually and they typically picked and chose among the different types of charges what he what they convicted him of the prosecution will be able to argue that the sentencing judge here should consider all of the conduct that he was charged with because there's a lesser standard so from the prosecution standpoint it is better to have some bank fraud charges of which he was convicted some foreign bank account reports and he got all the tax frauds so the the fact that they dribbled it through the indictment is actually helpful to the prosecution and also shows that in each of their different groups of charges that they were justified and they were legitimate because the jury convicted on at least some of them ken do we have a sense on the other ten was it nine to three ten to two eleven to one six six what kind of do we have a sense on the other ten if it was most of them were leaning one way or the other Dan my know did they pull the judge pull the jury on those this drop the judge pulled the jury and they all just agreed that they I think it would normally be in about three months I know they did set a date and we'll get that for you in a minute Chuck we just did that of the courtroom and and what is the maximum use the sentencing guidelines we have eight counts here if for some reason the max was hit on all of them is that what are we looking at here so I was trying to do a rough calculation with Ken here if if he was convicted of everything the guidelines the best case scenario for the prosecution would be about 11 to 14 months and they will sorry 11 to 14 years argue for that each totaled okay total the way that the Sentencing Guidelines work is they group all the different counts together so that there will only be one guideline range for the whole indictment and the way i roughly calculated it is that for everything he was susceptible to here it would be 11 to 14 years the prosecution will argue that if you just look at the counts of conviction my rough estimate is about seven to nine years that he would that the guideline range would be and then the judge is free to vary from that how he wishes and often in white collar cases judges go below the guidelines and chuck I don't have to tell you the big question now obviously is looking what happened with Michael Cohen today what will Paul Manafort do will he continue to fight this case this legal defense must be costing in millions of dollars yeah will he go forward with a trial in Washington DC where the penalties are even higher the evidence that was even more voluminous or will he cut his losses cut a deal and tell what he knows if anything about potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian election interference effort all right Ken
