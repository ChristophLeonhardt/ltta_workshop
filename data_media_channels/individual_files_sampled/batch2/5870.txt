I'm joined now by arizona's other Republican Senator Jeff Flake who also had some choice words about president Trump's actions today senator thank you so much for being here thank you for having me so my question today and it's I think the question of the day not what will Republicans say but what will Republicans do after today's news conference well one thing we can do is reaffirm our support for the intelligence community for the FBI and the DOJ for putting together these indictments that I can tell you not of none of my colleagues and certainly I don't question it and ensure that Russia is held to account remember it was over a year ago that we had to pass sanctions over the president's objection 98 - he previously said that he would veto any sanction package so we passed it 98 - - and he couldn't be to it any more so I think that we've got to do something similar here at least express our support for the intelligence community so more sanctions well obviously we've got to hold Russia to account I don't expect these individuals to be extradited but but we can't impose additional sanctions or increase or find new individuals - sanctioned in Russia certainly what about holding up confirmation for judges for the next Supreme Court judge no I I don't think that that's the answer why not III with regard to tariffs I had said that I was tired of doing just the president's executive calendar particularly on the circuit court judges until we got a vote on tariffs we did last week which passed 88 to 11 it was non-binding but I don't think we could have passed a binding vote last week I think we will be able to do so however in the coming weeks but but I do think that it's time for the Congress as a whole as a body certainly the Senate to express its support for the intelligence community do you think that is enough though to get through to this president do you think that somebody does need to get through to him after all DNI Dan Coates sounded an alarm last week over the weekend before this latest a statement that he sent out over the weekend he sat down with CBS and said he doesn't know if he believes dan coates isn't know if he believes that assessment and that then today the DNA committee and I came out with another very strong statement is it enough just to say we believe in the intelligence community together president like I said we can do what we've done before if the president refuses to impose new sanctions or to treat Russia differently we can the Congress can move ahead and if we pass it with a big enough margin then the president can't be to it I understand you've already done that and then the message didn't seem to get to the president because after all he stood on on a stage today with Vladimir Putin and and denied the the assessment of all of our intelligence agencies and agreed with Vladimir Putin the man who our intelligence agencies said attacked our democracy in our elections that did not seem to get through to him so wouldn't it be more appropriate to to hold up judges as you were doing with tariffs no I'm not going there yet I think there are things that we can do to let the president know where we stand and imposing additional sanctions if we need to if that's what's appropriate in terms of response is what we need to do we can not jump just sanctions on Russia but pass additional legislation I think that we do have more of an impetus now you've heard statements out of Republicans that you haven't heard before some of us have been critical for a while on this subject but today I think we reached a whole new level or at least I I hope we have you say you're not there yet is there something that could happen that would put you there no I don't want to go there we can we can stay closer to the subject at hand and obviously we have a lot of backlog of judges to go through they've been held up on the floor so it's a slow-moving train to get these approved and we shouldn't be denying you know judges on the courts that need them right now the tariffs but we can't because I'm sorry to interrupt but here's what here's my question what is more important than the sanctity of our elections what is more important than that if they're not going to do it for this but you do it for tariffs I'm a little confused about the about the difference there well I got what I wanted the votes on tariffs and I think that will have the impetus now to get a vote that actually is binding on tariffs but we still haven't held up to a large extent the judge is moving through at least on the Republican side I think that we can stick closer to the subject at hand so that's what I'm going to try to do why do you think the president refuses to say anything negative to Vladimir Putin it puzzles all of us I can tell you it's not just they won't say anything bad about Putin but he does say disparaging and belittling things about our allies we saw that at the g7 we saw it again with a NATO summit and and then we see it you know with regard to the Russians and what he's willing to do in terms of praising dictators speaking fondly of them it just is puzzling to all of us do you think Russia has compromising information on the president I have no way of knowing that and I certainly myself I doubt it that but I have no way of knowing you have any other reasonable explanation for why he would behave this way I don't I I'm trying to figure it out myself and I think it's puzzled all of us but it it doesn't feel too good I'm sure for the intelligence agencies and for the others to be thrown under the bus like this it was not a good day for the country do you think your Republican colleagues have done a good job of lifting up this investigation and protecting this investigation there's a headline from Politico saying house conservatives are preparing a push to impeach rod Rose ensign who's overseeing Robert Moore yeah that that's hard to understand as well I think the Rosenstein has done a good job by I think that they ought to be protected we in the Senate passed in the Judiciary Committee language with the intent to protect the investigation I don't know if it's constitutional or not but it was an attempt at least but I do think that we can do more and speaking out now this week saying that we support the intelligence community and these conclusions and commit to hold the Russians to account would be a good thing for the Senate to do what do you want to hear from Mitch McConnell well I'd like to hear that we're going to bring something to the floor that reaffirms our support for the intelligence community and their fine that's what I'd like to hear have you spoken to him I haven't I just got in town two minutes ago Senator Jeff Flake senator thank you very much
