If you look at the delete
Facebook hashtag, people
are really angry.
And I think they’re
sort of becoming
aware of the extent
to which they’re
being watched and tracked.
This feels like it’s a turning
point for many of the people
who use Facebook and
aren’t happy about how
their data is being used.
And the more they find out,
the less happy they are.
I think people
underestimate how hard
it is to untangle ourselves from
a social network like Facebook.
So before you delete your
Facebook account, just
remember that it’s not
just Facebook that you’ll
be losing access to.
It’s also all of
the third-party apps
that you use
Facebook to log in to
or that are connected or plugged
into your Facebook account.
So it’s important
before you make
this choice to go
through those apps,
see which ones you
still need access to,
and if there are any, to switch
your login from Facebook
to something else.
So you can still access
it even after you’ve
deleted your Facebook account.
And there are just some apps
that you won’t have access
to if you delete your
Facebook account.
Facebook has a lot of ways
to track your activity
even if you’re not logged in
or if you delete your account
entirely, and it uses what
it calls the social graph
to track the activity of
people across the internet
beyond just Facebook.com.
This accounts for everyone
who uses the internet,
and you don’t have to have
a Facebook profile to be
tracked by Facebook.
For example, if your
friends have Facebook
accounts or Facebook
Messenger accounts
and if they’ve uploaded
their contacts to Facebook
and if you’re one of
their contacts, then
Facebook knows your name
and your phone number
and can track you. When
you deactivate or delete
your Facebook profile,
your profile disappears
and people can’t see what
you posted or search for you.
But all of the data that you
gave over to third-party app
developers is still out there.
And those developers
are not required
to delete it or do
anything with it.
They can use it
however they want.
For as long as they want.
There’s a whole list of ways
that Facebook will track you
outside of Facebook.com. To do
the full cleanse, you would have
to actually manually block
a list of URLs that they
use to track you.
These are the lengths you’d have
to go to if you truly wanted
to get off of Facebook’s grid.
