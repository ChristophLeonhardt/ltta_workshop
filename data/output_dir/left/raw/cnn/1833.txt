1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,930
since the day I took office we've added
1.2 million private-sector jobs and a

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,210
lot more than that if you go from the
time we actually got elected November 8

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,770
including 125,000 manufacturing jobs and
we just had another very good month for

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,510
manufacturing and the jobs you probably
also there but if we're going to keep

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,830
this momentum going and allow the
economy to truly take off as it should

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,800
it is vital that we reduce the crushing
tax burden on our companies and on our

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,239
workers we pay the highest tax of any
country in the world on businesses and

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,590
we can't keep doing that
last week I repeated my principles the

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,629
tax reform first we must make the tax
code as simple as possible it's

10
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:55,949
extremely complex it's not fair and it's
extremely hard to understand so we want

11
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,059
to make it as simple as possible second
we must provide tax relief for

12
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,820
middle-class workers and families third
we must restore a competitive edge which

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,080
we've lost we're doing fine but we lost
the competitive edge you see what's

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,210
going on all over the world so we can
have real job growth throughout America

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,990
we can't be the jobs magnet of the world
if we continue to tax our industries at

16
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,320
rate 60 percent higher then companies in
other countries can't do it and finally

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,299
we must bring back trillions of dollars
that are currently parked overseas we

18
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,450
have in my opinion four trillion dollars
four trillion dollars massive amounts of

19
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,750
money that can't come back to our
country because of our tax code or

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,049
because of the race and this is more
than just tax reform this is tax cutting

21
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,049
to put in a very simple term we're going
to cut taxes we're going to reduce taxes

22
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,520
for people for individuals for
middle-income families we're going to

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,470
reduce taxes for companies and those
companies are going to produce

24
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,190
tax reform that follows these principles
will create millions of new jobs and

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,830
ensure that more products are stamped
with the very beautiful letters and

26
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:20,700
words made in the USA it's time to lower
our taxes bring back our wealth and make

27
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,730
America the jobs magnet that it can
become and pretty quickly it's really in

28
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,470
other words expression I don't know if
too many of you have heard it it's time

29
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,950
to make America great again has anybody
heard that expression I don't think so

30
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,280
that's what we're doing we'll make it
America great again you see it in the

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,049
numbers you see it with jobs you see it
with companies moving back in there

32
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:52,110
moving back in at very very big numbers
they're coming back into our country and

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,930
you haven't seen that for a long time so
we're very proud of that

34
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,670
so we're now going to discuss tax reform
and tax cuts and I appreciate you being

35
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,739
here thank you everybody very much thank
you

36
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,540
well I have a great heart for these
folks we're talking about a great love

37
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,420
for them and people think in terms of
children but they're really young adults

38
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,370
I have a love for these people and
hopefully now Congress will be able to

39
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,030
help them and do it properly and I can
tell you in speaking to members of

40
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,230
Congress they want to be able to do
something and do it right and really we

41
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,680
have no choice we have to be able to do
something and I think it's going to work

42
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:42,730
out very well and long term it's going
to be the right solution thank you very

43
00:03:42,730 --> 00:00:00,000
much everybody
