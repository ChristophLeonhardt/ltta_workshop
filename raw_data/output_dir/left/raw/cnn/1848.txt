1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
without the on-camera briefings which
which journalists have been pushing to

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,039
remain on camera and not have held off
camera what I've been noticing is a lack

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,030
of answers let me show you what I mean
first a lot of I don't knows from Sarah

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,609
Aqaba Sanders no I don't I don't know
I'm not sure I don't know I'm not sure

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,180
we don't know I'm not aware of that I'm
not aware of any specific I'm not sure

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,180
not sure about the specifics I don't
know I'm not aware of that there's a

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,410
twist on the I don't know it's the I'll
get back to you here's what we noticed

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,390
from all the briefings in August from
Sanders I'd have to check on that and

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,780
get back to you I'd have to get back to
you on that I'd have to certainly check

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,480
in to that I'd have to check on that and
get back to you it's something I'd have

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,450
to check into and get back to you I will
try to look into that I have to look

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,539
into that we will certainly let you know
I'll let you know I'll let you know Mele

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,480
you know I hate to sound like a broken
record I'll let you know we'll let you

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,840
know we'll let you guys know well you
know let you know and certainly let you

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,690
know let you know that's gonna happen
I'll certainly keep you posted we'll

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,780
keep you posted I'll circle back with it
will continue to keep you guys updated

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,129
are you saying you will ask him and get
back to us no I said I would have to in

18
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,510
order to answer that question
so reporters say she normally does not

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,530
get back to those questions that are
asked of the briefings sometimes the

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,580
press shop does Alice your reaction as a
former communications director for a

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,880
campaign but clearly the number one
mission and focus of the briefings

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,360
whether it's at the White House or on
the state level is to to get your

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,810
message out and get your points out
there and and put your agenda out there

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,650
and then obviously follow up with
questions from the media and a couple

25
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,579
things to always keep in mind when
you're in that position is to be factual

26
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,930
be consistent with your boss and make
sure that if there are additional

27
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,450
questions that you make sure and you do
that and and answer as many questions as

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,340
you possibly can and that is critical to
do so but at the same time look Sarah

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,329
and the comms team there at the White
House are available 24/7 to answer

30
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,590
questions for the media I know that for
a fact and the press briefing is just

31
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,659
one aspect of what they do to answer the
questions and it's also important that

32
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,079
while they're being factual and they're
being consistent with their boss they

33
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,199
can't get out ahead of their boss if
they're working on a program or an

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,770
initiative such as Daka she can't get
out there in the press briefing and

35
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,590
something before it's out there and I
know a lot of the questions that you

36
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,090
just played clips from where many of the
same questions about an initiative that

37
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,650
hasn't been finalized yet and she really
can't get out there ahead of it so with

38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,850
regard to that I think it's important
for for reporters to understand you know

39
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,690
when the administration is ready to
announce a certain program then they

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,290
will certainly do it but it's never
helpful to put it out in drips and drabs

41
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,740
at press briefings and I think that's
obviously what Sarah's being really

42
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,970
careful to do in these cases
wasn't it a head scratcher on on Friday

43
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,870
when the president said he was going to
announce his dreamers decision on this

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,670
weekend or Monday then Erol Sanders said
no it's gonna be on Tuesday just seem

45
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,120
like another frankly in the scheme of
things relatively small but another

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,840
example of the confusion from the Trump
White House well that's right I mean

47
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,740
look the reality is the the in effect
the communications director I guess

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,650
they've gone through three or four of
them now the real communications

49
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,770
director is sitting in the Oval Office
right he's making his own schedule

50
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,510
he's determining the pace of policy
development and the announcements and so

51
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,940
forth and so you know you look at I love
that montage you put up there of the

52
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,480
comms team sort of just racking up IOUs
I'll get back to you I'll get back to

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,650
you I don't know I don't know and and a
lot of that is just the normal way

54
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,190
things are supposed to work because
those are answers to questions about

55
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,050
various agencies some some fairly
obscure time she doesn't want to ask her

56
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,750
boss she doesn't want to know what
President Trump's gonna answer but she

57
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,890
says I haven't asked him I don't know
well that's right and it sort of speaks

58
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,130
to the fact that this is a two-way
street she is supposed to not just be

59
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,920
dispensing the party line I mean Alice
is correct that's sort of the primary

60
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,209
job but she's also supposed to break
back to the policy team to the White

61
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,320
House to the president if necessary that
a lot of questions are coming from from

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,040
the public in the form of questions from
the news media and that they've they're

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:00:00,000
gonna have to sort of step up the pace
on some of these questions
