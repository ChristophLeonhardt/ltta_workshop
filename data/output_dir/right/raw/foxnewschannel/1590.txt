1
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:12,503
>> Tucker: IN RECENT

2
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:15,005
APPEARANCE ON AUSTRALIA

3
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,907
TELEVISION PINK HAIRED

4
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:18,008
DESCRIBE DEAN CARSON SAID

5
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:19,143
THAT PARENTS SHOULD ASK

6
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:20,377
BABIES FOR THEIR CONSENT

7
00:00:20,377 --> 00:00:22,446
BEFORE CHANGING THEIR

8
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:22,980
DIAPERS.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,615
THE INTENT IS TO FOSTER A

10
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,884
CULTURE OF CONSENT FOR

11
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:27,951
BABIES WHO WOULD BE, OF

12
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,787
COURSE, IN DEEP TROUBLE IF

13
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:30,954
THEY ACTUALLY NEEDED TO

14
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:32,622
SUPPLY CONSENT FOR ANYTHING.

15
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:33,524
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY CRAZY BUT

16
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:34,658
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T

17
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,893
HAPPEN OR BECOME THE LAW IN

18
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:37,161
THIS COUNTRY AND SO TO CHECK

19
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:40,230
ON WHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING

20
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,666
TO LOOK LIKE WE BRING OUR

21
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,768
LIBERAL SHERPA CATHY AREU TO

22
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,003
JOIN US.

23
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:46,770
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,373
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

25
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:50,174
>> Tucker: SO CONSENT FOR

26
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:51,241
DIAPER CHANGING FOR BABIES.

27
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:52,743
>> YES.

28
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:53,510
>> Tucker: LEAVING THIS OFF

29
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,344
WHETHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

30
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,180
IT RAISES THE OBVIOUS

31
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,680
TACTICAL QUESTION.

32
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,981
>> YEAH.

33
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,349
>> Tucker: HOW WOULD A BABY

34
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,783
GIVE CONSENT?

35
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:02,686
>> WELL, THE IDEA ISN'T

36
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:03,554
EXACTLY THE BABY IS NOT

37
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:06,190
GOING TO SAY YES OR NO BUT

38
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,691
SAYING GIVE THE BABY A FEW

39
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:08,025
MOMENTS.

40
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,293
TALK TO THE BABY SAY IS IT

41
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:10,861
OKAY I'M GOING TO CHANGE

42
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,230
YOUR NAPPY SHE IS AUSTRALIAN

43
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,165
THAT'S HOW THEY SAY DIAPERS.

44
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:15,833
>> Tucker: YOU WOULDN'T SAY

45
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,633
THAT TO AN AMERICAN BABY.

46
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,901
>> I DON'T THINK AN AMERICAN

47
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:18,836
BABY WOULD UNDERSTAND.

48
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:20,104
ACTUALLY JUST TEACHING

49
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:22,473
CONSENT WHAT CONSENT IS

50
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,274
TEACHING BODY AUTONOMY.

51
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:25,609
TEACHING I'M NOT GOING TO

52
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:26,877
TOUCH YOUR BODY IF YOU DON'T

53
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:27,778
WANT ME TO.

54
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,279
IT'S JUST LIKE TALKING TO A

55
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,214
BABY ABOUT ANYTHING.

56
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:31,215
MOMMY LOVES YOU.

57
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:32,149
DADDY LOVES YOU.

58
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:33,650
SO PEOPLE TALK TO BABIES ALL

59
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,452
THE TIME SO WHY WOULDN'T THE

60
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:36,620
CONCEPT OF TALKING TO A BABY

61
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,088
WHILE DOING SOMETHING SO

62
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:39,690
SERIOUS AS, YOU KNOW,

63
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,327
CHANGING A DIAPER BE SO

64
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:44,361
RIDICULOUS?

65
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:45,729
>> Tucker: BECAUSE YOU

66
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,430
TYPICALLY DON'T EXPECT A

67
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,698
BABY TO RESPOND IN A WAY

68
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:48,799
THAT CAN YOU UNDERSTAND.

69
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,234
AGAIN, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT

70
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,635
CONSENT LOOKS LIKE?

71
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:53,403
LET'S JUST DO A LITTLE ROLE

72
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:54,338
PLAY GOING WE COULD.

73
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:55,806
>> ROLE PLAYING, I'M THE

74
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:56,140
BABY.

75
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,108
AND YOU ARE CHANGING MY

76
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:58,542
DIAPER.

77
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,443
>> Tucker: I'M GOING TO MAKE

78
00:01:59,443 --> 00:01:59,843
THIS CHANGE.

79
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:01,445
>> UM-HUH.

80
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:02,846
>> Tucker: AND YOU, HOW DO

81
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:04,014
YOU EXPRESS YOUR CONSENT OR

82
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:05,482
LACK OF CORN SENT FOR THAT?

83
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:08,151
>> WELL, IF I START CRYING,

84
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:09,152
SOMETHING'S WRONGS, SO YOU

85
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,253
PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO DO

86
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:11,321
ANYTHING AT THAT MOMENT

87
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,056
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO

88
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:14,725
MAKE DIAPER CHANGING

89
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:15,659
SOMETHING THAT GOES ALONG

90
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,660
WITH CRYING.

91
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,494
YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT ME

92
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:19,563
TO BE IN A HEALTHY STATE OF

93
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:20,797
MIND SO THAT IN THE FUTURE

94
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:22,332
WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE

95
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:25,202
PRIVATE THINGS, I HAVE BEEN

96
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:28,939
I WILL BE A WELL-ADJUSTED

97
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:29,339
ADULT.

98
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:30,207
>> Tucker: MAYBE THE CHILD'S

99
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:31,808
CRYING BECAUSE HIS DIAPER IS

100
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,109
DIRTY.

101
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:32,643
>> RIGHT.

102
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:33,210
OBVIOUSLY.

103
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,510
YEAH.

104
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,045
SO, I MEAN, THE PARENT WOULD

105
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:36,547
HAVE TO BE THE BEST JUDGE OF

106
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:37,814
THAT.

107
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,416
BUT, I GUESS HE WOULD MAKE

108
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,784
ME CRY IF YOU ASKED ME IF I

109
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,152
WANTED YOU TO, AND THEN I

110
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,520
STARTED CRYING, MAYBE YOU

111
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,523
SHOULD GET A HINT, TAKE THE

112
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:46,890
HINT.

113
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,658
>> Tucker: WOULD IT BE LIKE

114
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:48,559
AN EYE GESTURE?

115
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,493
YOU ARE A MOM.

116
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:52,129
DO YOUR KIDS CAN YOU READ

117
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,498
THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND

118
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:56,233
KNOW THAT WHAT THEY ARE

119
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:56,567
SAYING?

120
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,269
>> SUPER HEALTHY.

121
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,104
BABY EXPERT SAID 0 TO 2 ARE

122
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:01,805
THE TRUST YEARS.

123
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:02,973
DURING THE TRUST YEARS YOU

124
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,308
WANT THE BABY TO TRUST YOU.

125
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:05,108
SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG

126
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:06,310
WITH TALKING TO A BABY AND

127
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,477
THOSE SITUATIONS JUST

128
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:08,545
TEACHING A BABY HOW TO

129
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:09,246
TRUST.

130
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:10,147
SO, THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE

131
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,348
YOU ARE TEACHING A BABY TO

132
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:12,249
TRUST YOU.

133
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:13,717
SO I DON'T THINK THE BABY IS

134
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,552
EXPECTED TO NECESSARILY GIVE

135
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:15,886
CONSENT.

136
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:16,553
YOU ARE JUST TEACHING THE

137
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:18,689
BABY TO TRUST YOU.

138
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,691
YOU ARE ASKING THE BABY FOR

139
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:21,725
BODILY -- YOU ARE ASKING THE

140
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,794
BABY TO EXPRESS BODILY

141
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:24,261
AUTONOMY.

142
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:26,263
THAT'S THE BIG POINT HERE.

143
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:27,064
>> Tucker: BABIES ARE NOT

144
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:30,500
SUPER GREAT AT UNDERSTANDING

145
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,834
ENGLISH.

146
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,202
MAYBE OTHER BABIES ARE MORE

147
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:33,237
INTELLIGENT THAN MINE WERE.

148
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:34,738
WHAT IF THE CHILD KEEPS

149
00:03:34,738 --> 00:03:36,506
SAYING NO LIKE OVER A PERIOD

150
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:37,708
OF WEEKS AND YOU KEEP GOING

151
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,209
IN THERE AND REALLY LIKE TO

152
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,345
CHANGES THE DIAPER BUT THE

153
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:42,980
CHILD REFUSES TO GIVE ME

154
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,848
CONSENT AT SOME POINT IT

155
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:45,949
BECOMES NEGLECT AND ALSO

156
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:46,250
NSAY.

157
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,851
>> CONCEPT OF TEACHING

158
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:48,185
CONSENT.

159
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,119
TALKING ABOUT IT DURING THAT

160
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,153
MOMENT SO MANY PARENTS DO

161
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:51,788
NOT DISCUSS IT AND THEY --

162
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:54,091
THE BABIES GROW UP AND THE

163
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,392
ENGLISH LANGUAGE THEY'RE NOT

164
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:56,226
EVEN USED TO TALKING ABOUT

165
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:59,730
THOSE THINGS.

166
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,165
TEACHING TRUST, IT'S TRUST

167
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:02,532
ISSUE.

168
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:03,233
>> Tucker: YOU DON'T REALLY

169
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,268
DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH A

170
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:04,568
BABY.

171
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:05,535
>> YOU DISCUSS EVERYTHING

172
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,372
WITH A BABY.

173
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:09,539
I'M GOING TO PUT THIS LOTION

174
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:10,540
ON YOUR ARM.

175
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,876
YOU TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

176
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:13,944
I'M GOING TO DRESS YOU.

177
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:14,978
PARENTS TALK TO BABIES ALL

178
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:15,746
DAY LONG.

179
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:18,015
I'M MAKING DINNER FOR YOU.

180
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,683
>> Tucker: WHAT ABOUT THE

181
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:20,483
POLIO VACCINE.

182
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,519
>> YEAH GET A VACCINE.

183
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,954
YES PEOPLE HAVE TO GIVE

184
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:24,288
CONSENT.

185
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:26,189
YOU CAN'T GIVE ORGANS IF YOU

186
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,357
DON'T GIVE CONSENT.

187
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:28,925
EVEN DEAD PEOPLE CAN MAKE

188
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,729
DECISIONS WHY CAN'T BABIES?

189
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:33,397
>> Tucker: MAKE DECISIONS.

190
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,498
>> YOU HAVE TO GIVE CONSENT

191
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:35,966
TO HAVE THE ORGANS TAKEN

192
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:37,601
AFTER YOU DIE YOU CAN GIVE

193
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,670
CONSENT FROM A BABY YEAR TO

194
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,437
YOUR DEATH?

195
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:41,705
PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS GIVE

196
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:43,373
CONSENT IF THEIR BODY IS

197
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,742
GOING TO BE TOUCHED.

198
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,677
>> Tucker: SO, RIGHT, IF THE

199
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:47,511
CHILD SAYS NO, I DON'T WANT

200
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,413
THE BABY INDICATES BY CRYING

201
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:51,381
OR ROLLING HIS EYES I DON'T

202
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,617
WANT A POLIO RACK SEEN THEN

203
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:55,652
YOU JUST DON'T GIVE THEM A

204
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:56,453
POLIO VACCINE THEN?

205
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,088
>> I THINK IT'S THE IDEA OF

206
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:59,289
DISCUSSING IT WITH THE BABY.

207
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:00,324
THE CONSENT, I DON'T THINK,

208
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,825
IS NECESSARILY OUT ISSUE.

209
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:04,795
IT'S THE IDEA.

210
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:05,228
>> Tucker: OH.

211
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:07,230
>> YOU ARE DEVELOPING TRUST.

212
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,532
>> Tucker: EVEN IF THE BABY

213
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:09,733
SELLS NO, NO DOESN'T REALLY

214
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:10,067
MEAN NO.

215
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,102
>> THE BABY CAN'T TALK

216
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:14,738
DURING THE DIAPER YEARS.

217
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:15,639
>> Tucker: BABY'S NO DOESN'T

218
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,006
MEAN NO.

219
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:19,242
I TOTALLY GET THAT WHERE IS

220
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,712
THE OBEDIENCE.

221
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:22,846
CHILD LEARNS TO OBEY WHAT

222
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:26,149
YOU SAY.

223
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:30,721
GIVE AND TAKE COLLOQUY WITH

224
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,622
A

225
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:33,323
MUTE PERSON.

226
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,624
>> THIS IS DIVERSIFICATION

227
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:36,126
TALKING WITH THE BABY.

228
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:36,560
CONVERSATION.

229
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,728
IT'S NOT DISCIPLINING, THESE

230
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,197
ARE THE DISCIPLINE YEARS.

231
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:42,899
AS A CHILD EXPERT.

232
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:43,567
>> Tucker: IS THERE A POINT

233
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,335
WHERE THE BABY SAYS MOM,

234
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:45,936
STOP TALKING.

235
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:46,737
YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

236
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:47,904
GO AHEAD AND CHANGE THE

237
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,238
DIAPER.

238
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:48,872
I DON'T THINK MOST DADS

239
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:50,073
WOULD GO FOR THIS.

240
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:50,440
WHATEVER.

241
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,874
MAYBE DAD.

242
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:52,876
I DON'T KNOW.

243
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:53,677
HEY, PARENT.

244
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:54,444
STOP TALKING.

245
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:55,746
GO AHEAD AND CHANGE IT.

246
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:56,713
>> EXACTLY.

247
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:57,381
I DON'T THINK THESE ARE THE

248
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,315
YEARS THAT THE BABY WOULD BE

249
00:05:58,315 --> 00:05:59,516
ABLE TO RESPOND BUT IT'S

250
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,551
JUST GETTING THE CONCEPT OF

251
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,220
I'M TOUCHING YOUR BODY.

252
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,690
YOU HAVE BODILY ATOM

253
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:06,723
YOU HAVE BODILY AATM

254
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:07,391
YOU HAVE BODILY AATOM MY.

255
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,492
YOU SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO

256
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:10,794
SAY YES OR NO IF SOMEBODY IS

257
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:11,862
TOUCHING YOUR BODY.

258
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:12,863
I'M GOING TO TEACH THAT

259
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,131
CONCEPT DURING THE TRUST

260
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:14,498
YEARS.

261
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:15,265
>> Tucker: I LIKE THE

262
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,500
CONCEPT KIDS DO WHAT THEY'RE

263
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:16,800
TOLD.

264
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,968
THAT'S MY FAVORITE CONCEPT

265
00:06:17,968 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR KIDS.
