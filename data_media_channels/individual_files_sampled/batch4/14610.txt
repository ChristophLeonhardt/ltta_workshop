she's actually Muslim herself but because this Pakistani doctor heard that she was living a little bit like a British woman she had gone on a date with a man he assumed that she was a prostitute and he could do anything to her this is just as you've listed time and time again different cases back in Canada this is just a long stream of cases in the UK so yes I read this today and it doesn't expire so surprise me oh he keeps it he can continue working as a doctor and this isn't there's plenty of cases like this we had a similar case of a a Muslim man who who raped his 13 year old child and when he come to court he said that he was not aware that he was not allowed to because he'd only been to Muslim schools had been to a Muslim addresser he'd left school up from a Muslim a dresser he'd know no different he got completely scot-free and it's just it's just the same as this it's always blamed on their cultural norms or their because because under under that at the last case the Muslim lad said that under Sharia if she started up UB then he's allowed to and of course at 13 she had so he saw it as justified there's case after cases of not just another case from this week where a foreign nurse was working in a hospital and they knit they're working in the care home they needed to ring 999 for the emergency services because someone was ill but she couldn't speak a word of English so she couldn't she could not get over what was wrong with the person who was dying she couldn't tell them in English sorry so this doesn't surprise me but it's becoming so common and this excuse is constantly used again I saw this week there was a road rage attack where a Muslim man drove and run five people over near the cars and he said that because he hadn't eaten for 20 days during Ramadan their religion and their cultural cultural cultural norms or their religious beliefs constantly used to justify or excuse themselves from crimes of commit that's an excerpt from a daily TV show the Ezra Levin show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always to interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
