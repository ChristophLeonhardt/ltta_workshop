>> WHAT I WOULD DO, I KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
I'M GOING TO SANCTION THE
HELL OUT OF SAUDI ARABIA.
YOU KNOW, WE DEAL WITH BAD
PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.
BUT THIS IS IN OUR FACE.
I FEEL PERSONALLY OFFENDED.
THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT
CONTEMPT FOR US.
WHY WOULD YOU PUT A GUY LIKE
ME AND THE PRESIDENT IN THIS
BOX AFTER ALL THE PRESIDENT
HAS DONE.
THIS GUY HAS GOT TO GO.
SAUDI ARABIA, IF YOU ARE
LISTENING, THERE ARE A LOT
OF GOOD PEOPLE YOU CAN
CHOOSE BUT MBS HAS TAINTED
YOUR COUNTRY AND TAINTED
HIMSELF.
>> Neil: THE SENATE FOREIGN
RELATIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER
RAND PAUL ON THAT.
SENATOR, WHAT YOUR COLLEAGUE
WAS SAYING WAS THE CROWNED
PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN
HAS TO GO.
>> WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR
THAT HE IS COMING AROUND
TAKING A LINE ON SAUDI
ARABIA.
OVER A YEAR NOW I HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO GET CONGRESS FROM
SENDING ARMS TO SAUDI
ARABIA.
SO FAR LINDSEY HAS BEEN ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IT'S
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT
SAUDI ARABIA IS THE LARGEST
STATE SPONSOR OF RADICAL
ISLAM.
THEY FUND TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF THAT DEMOCRATS AROUND THE
OF THAT DEMOCRATS AROUN MTHE
OF THAT DEMOCRATS AROUN MADE
OF THAT DEMOCRATS AROUN MADRASA.
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR DECADES.
THEY ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS.
DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN
YEMEN, IT'S A CATASTROPHE, A
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER.
THIS LATEST EPISODE KILLING
A JOURNALIST IS JUST PROOF,
YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED NOT TO
BE ARMING THEM.
>> Neil: YOU WONDER FEN THIS
WE WOULD TAKE APART THE DEAL
THAT WE SCORED WITH THE
SAUDIS LAST YEAR
$110 BILLION WORTH, THE
PRESIDENT WAS ARGUING THEY
WILL JUST GO TO THE CHINESE
IT WILL JUST GO TO THE
RUSSIANS WHETHER IT'S THIS
CROWNED PRINCE INVOLVED OR
NOT, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
EXTRAORDINARY LEVERAGE OVER
THEM.
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT
THEIR AIR FORCE CAN'T GO A
COUPLE MONTHS WITHOUT SPARE
PARTS.
THEIR AIR FORCE IS ENTIRELY
U.S. PLANES.
THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON US FOR
PARTS AND MECHANICS.
THEY ARE ENTIRELY DEPEND
DENTING ON US.
THEY CAN'T GO MONTHS WITHOUT
OUR HELP.
WE TELL THEM ABSOLUTELY YOU
ARE NOT GOING TO DO BUSINESS
WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT CHOPS
UP JOURNALISTS, PUTS THEM IN
LITTLE BAGS AND THEN ESCORTS
THEM OUT IN AN SUV AND DUMPS
THEM SOMEWHERE.
THIS IS NOT 
BEHAVIOR.
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AROUND
THE WORLD -- WE HAVE BEEN
TURNING A BLIND EYE TO SAUDI
ARABIA FOR DECADES.
THEY ARE THE WORST ACTOR
PROMOTING TERRORISM.
KNEEL PEEL WE HAVE A VERY
BAD CONNECTION WITH YOU ARE
SENATOR, I HOPE WE DON'T
HAVE TO HANG UP ON YOU HERE.
THE CROWNED PRINCE ISN'T
ALONE.
THE ROYAL FAMILY ITSELF,
IT'S THE PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR
OVER THE YEARS THAT UPSETS
YOU.
SO HE COULD GO BUT YOU MIGHT
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS
JUST INHOSPITABLE, RIGHT?
>> IN PAKISTAN THEY FUND
OVER 20,000 MADRASAS THAT
TEACH HATRED OF AMERICA AND
HATREDS OF WESTERN WAYS AND
HATRED OF CHRISTIANITY.
POO LOOTED INDONESIA WHICH
USED TO HAVE A MUCH MORE
MILD ISLAM.
THEY ARE POLLUTING
PHILIPPINES WITH WAHHABIISM.
THEY ARE BAD ACTORS.
WE DON'T NEED TO SANCTION 15
ROGUE ACTORS THAT THEY SEND
OVER HERE.
15 THUGS ARE 15 THUGS.
WE NEED TO NOT SELL ARMS TO
THE REGIME BECAUSE THE
REGIME IS A BAD ACTOR
WORLDWIDE.
>> Neil: SENATOR, I WOULD BE
REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION
THERE WAS ANOTHER
DEVELOPMENT TODAY WHERE A
FEDERAL JUDGE THREW OUT
LAWSUIT FROM STORMY DANIELS.
HE PUT OUT A TWEET AFTER
THAT NOW CAN I GO AFTER
HORSE FACE REFERRING TO
STOICIAL DANIELS AND THIRD
RATE LAWYER IN GREAT STATE
OF TEXAS.
SHE WILL CONFIRM THE LETTER
SHE SIGNED.
SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ME A
TOTAL CON.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT.
>> I'M AGNOSTIC.
I SPEND ALL MY TIME TRYING
TO GET US OUT OF THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN AND YEMEN AND
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO COMMENT
ON THAT.
>> Neil: DO YOU FIND TACKY.
>> I HAVE NO OPINION
WHATSOEVER.
I TOO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS
TO TALK ABOUT.
WE HAVE BEEN AT WAR FOR 17
YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN.
AND I DO BUG THE PRESIDENT.
WHEN I TALK TO THE
PRESIDENT, WHEN
WHAT I TALK TO HIM ABOUT IS
LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF
AFGHANISTAN.
WE HAVE NO MILITARY MISSION
OVER THERE.
THERE IS NO MILITARY
SOLUTION.
SO, I GUESS I JUST WANT TO
SPEND ALL MY TIME ON THAT.
I'M JUST NOT INTERESTED IN
THAT.
>> Neil: I JUST WONDER YOU
ARE TRYING TO STICK TO THAT
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT.
THAT WORRIES SOME IN YOUR
PARTY THAT HE IS WANDERING
OFF SCRIPT HERE.
>> YEAH.
I GUESS I JUST SPEND MY
TIME, YOU KNOW, TALKING
ABOUT THE THINGS, YOU KNOW,
DO I SPEAK TO THE PRESIDENT
THIS WEEKEND AND I TOLD HIM
THAT WE NEED TO CUT OFF ARMS
TO SAUDI ARABIA AND I TRY TO
USE ANY POWERS OF PERSUASION
I HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW THEY
ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS AND THAT
REALLY THE WAR IN YEMEN, HE
TALKS ABOUT HOW THE WAR IN
IRAQ WALLS SUCH A MISTAKE,
HE HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT
AND STRONG ON THAT.
THE WAR IN YEMEN IS EXACTLY
THE SAME WAY.
IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO CHAOS
