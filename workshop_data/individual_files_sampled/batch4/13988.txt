on Tuesday variety released its new cover looks like this it's a picture of Hamilton's at bran and Victor Dixon yes the guy who lectured Mike Pence while pence was enjoying a night out with the wife HBO's Lena Dunham Michael Moore Chelsea Handler and CNN's Van Jones they're all holding a large American flag looking upset and somber as you can see Dunham wears a shirt that says women are powerful and dangerous and she seems to hide behind the angel large more handler wears the shirt reading let's get to work now what on the eve of Trump's inauguration Hollywood in the media raised their voices as the headline well here's what please keep doing this Hollywood celebrities it will ensure that you continue to lose first off we should never be lectured by the likes of Lena Dunham a self-described sexual abuser of her own sister or Michael Moore the guy who does propaganda about the glories of Cuba's healthcare but more than that Hollywood seems completely oblivious to the fact that their shrill hysteria over Trump's election actually drives Americans into Trump's camp it's all abduction overawed you're just a few of the latest Hollywood idiot stories first the near octogenarian members of Green Day have released a new song tear against Donald Trump cobbling together footage of KKK rallies with Trump talking Billie Joe Armstrong 44 warbles a new day dawning comes without warning so don't think twice we live in troubled times meanwhile joss whedon the guy behind the mediocre avengers flicks jokes about paul ryan being raped to death by a rhinoceros Nicole Kidman had the temerity to say that the president ought to be given a baseline level of support and Whedon then tweeted out that she was a quote puppet for Trump Broadway's Jennifer Holliday she was forced out of singing at the inauguration due to death threats too bad she didn't lecture Mike Pence at a show or anything then she'd be a hero Holliday wasn't the only one Elstad from the inauguration of her death threats so as andrea bocelli steve harvey he was labeled a mediocre negro by mark Lamont Hill for meeting with Trump over any inner-city community development and then Hollywood wonders why Americans don't take them seriously on politics here's the truth at least half of Americans feel scorned by Hollywood and they should because Hollywood scorns them when I researched my book primetime propaganda I spoke with the top creators in Hollywood history they thought I was a leftist so they freely admitted to discriminating against conservatives in Hollywood and picturing middle middle Americans as rubes and racists and treating their shows as propaganda outlets for their viewpoints no wonder Americans just get sick when they see covers like the one from variety Michael Moore posing with the flag is the same guy who said that Trump supporters are legal terrorists but actual terrorists are Minutemen that makes most Americans queasy treating Lena Dunham like a moral voice despite her ardent love for abortion and her overt bragging about masturbating next to her 11 year old sister in bed yeah that's sort of nauseates Americans to acting as though Chelsea Handler a woman who said she should be applauded for her two abortions as a beacon of light that's pretty disgusting so Hollywood keep it coming nothing drives Americans away from leftism quite like the specter of uber rich uber famous uber immoral leftist treating them as direct to be scraped from their shoes it worked so well for Hillary Clinton she's creeping around the woods of Chappaqua as Donald Trump becomes the 45th President of the United States I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show yes we have tons to get to as always it a very exciting show planned for you with

donald trump's inauguration so the left has to turn everything into a racial issue it's just imperative for them to do so and so they continue to trot forward John Lewis the the congressman from Georgia and the civil rights hero to claim that Donald Trump is not really legit it turns out and by the way that John Lewis actually this is the second inauguration he's boycotting he also boycotted george w bush's inauguration is it possible that John Lewis is doing this not because he thinks the Trump is illegitimate but because he's leftist and Trump is apparently not yeah that's that's probable here's John Lewis explaining not why he's boycotting Trump but why he loves Obama no one no one's this morning at the King jr. had inspired me the way that Barack Obama inspire okay so if you think that then is it any wonder that you want to dump Trump on the side of the road is that any shock and you can see that there is a racial component to a lot of the people who are you hey Trump and it's not just because Trump is white or anything but what the attempt by the left is to polarize Americans along racial lines like Hillary was white - presumably they wouldn't boycotted her inauguration but there is an attempt to boycott Trump because they're trying to draw racial lines they're trying to say a lot of members of the left black community they're trying to say that the only legitimate black people are the people who will stand up against Trump and who will not offer him any sort of support or even the or even the possibility of support in the future Maxine Waters who's a nutcase congresswoman from out here in California she's the one who dubbed the LA riots the LA uprising she's wildly incompetent she's extraordinarily radical on racial matters she says the Trump should be impeached preemptively well here's what I'm trying to get to if we discover that Donald Trump are his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy if they are the ones who came up with crooked Hillary if they're the ones who came up with she's ill something's wrong with her energy and the way that he basically you know described her in the campaign I think that is something that would put the question squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached okay so she's talking about impeachment and she's not the only one a lot of Democrats very upset a lot of them are getting ready for trouble al Sharpton who is one of the world's great race baiters a man who was involved in the incitement of riots against Orthodox Jews in Crown Heights in 1991 was involved in incitement of riots against something called Freddie's fashion mark that ended with the death of several people in an arson al Sharpton is is still seen by the left as some sort of racial conciliator even though he has spent his entire career smearing people falsely with race charges and now Sharpton is using his platform whatever is left of it to to rip on Trump and suggest that he's not a legitimate president either I think that there's no question that the process that elected him was not legitimate when you look at the now evidence from the intelligence agencies that there was the influence from the Russians and involved in the public discourse at the time of the election when you look at those that were expunged from being able to clearly the process has a serious questions about it okay so you got al Sharpton doing this routine now there are some black folks who have met with Trump and have come away saying some relatively nice things about Trump so Steve Harvey met with Trump Trump is doing a smart thing he's inviting a lot of high-profile black folks to the Trump Tower to try and reach out and make overtures and suggest that he's gonna make life better for black Americans and not just white Americans who voted for him in the last election cycle and Jim Brown of course came out after meeting with Donald Trump he said listen Trump won fair fair and square and I'm going to support him as presidents of the United States so long as I can here is Jim Brown who met with Trump well I'll tell you when you win against all odds and you defeat those who were against you and I was for Hillary so I'm one of those who mr. Trump defeated but he is the president-elect of the United States I'm a citizen I'm not asking him to do everything I'm gonna pitch in and do some of the things that I can do with the like-minded people that I represent and he's in yes there's his perspective and a Smith has said something similar says just because you're giving Donald Trump a chance doesn't mean that you're doing anything racially wrong when noted comedian and host of the hit show Family Feud Steve Harvey exited from a meeting with president elect Donald Trump last week calling him quote a great man in quote to say there was a backlash would be a gross understatement the word cool and sellout was immediately thrown out his friend of contemporary DL Hughley wasn't happy either Amy his vitriolic Trump instead of Steve Harvey and of course it provided the perfect excuse for naysayers to accuse sports greats like Jim Brown or Ray Lewis of being used as photo ops weeks ago but on a day like today when we celebrate the birthday of dr. Martin Luther King jr. along with his undeniable historical impact perhaps it's time for all of us to see the big picture to essentially pay more attention to the issues permeating our society what it'll take to resolve them and connecting ourselves to who we ultimately can hold accountable rather than focusing on disdain for that very individual in a position to make a difference knowing that's not about to get us anywhere so there are a lot of people who hate Stephen a Smith Stephen a Smith actually will speak truth on racial matters farmer off and then a lot of his compatriots on ESPN so there's there's a small cadre of high-profile black figures who have met with Trump and this is driving the left baddie just as driving them up a wall mark Lamont Hill he's a frequent guest on fox news on CNN all the time he's also a professor at Morehouse College and he was in a debate about Steve Harvey visiting Trump Tower with a member of the of the sort of Trump team the person he's talking to here is is a fellow named Bruce Laval I guess and he's the national diversity coalition for Trump director Bruce Laval that's the the black guy who you will see second from the left there and then it's Gemma green and I can't remember the name of the the anchor here in any case the only two who matter for this particular conversation are the two on the on the right hand side of your screen and that would be mark Lamont Hill and Bruce Laval and here is them going at it over the fact that Steve Harvey met with Trump Negros being dragged in front of TV as a photo op for Donald Trump exploitative campaign against black people in you Mar so now you want to name okay so he calls them if you missed it cuz it was pretty quick there he calls them mediocre Negroes is what Mark Lamont Hill says there so here's how this conversation actually went what happened is that he'll talked about people like Steve Harvey and Jim Brown he said to keep bringing comedians and actors and athletes to represent black interest is demeaning it's disrespectful it's condescending bring some people up there with some expertise Donald Trump don't just bring up people to entertain and so Bruce LaBelle said well you don't even know what they talked about and he'll said well unless Steve Harvey turned into a policy analyst in the behind-the-scenes meeting I mean doesn't matter whether I was there my concern is the people he's trumpeting up and putting in front of the cameras and then after Lavelle said that that was silly he'll explode he sits a bunch of mediocre Negroes being direct in front of TV as a photo op for Donald Trump's exploit a to exploitative campaign against black people and you are a prime example of that so Lavelle is a prime example of a mediocre Negro being dragged in front of TV as a photo op for Donald Trump's exploitative campaign against black people so a few points to be made on this number one people on the Left do not get to complain about Donald Trump meeting with celebrities on political matters they don't okay Hillary's entire campaign was built around celebrities we showed you that picture from variety we can bring that up again half the people on this cover we're openly campaigning for Hillary Clinton right Lena Dunham was openly campaigning for Hillary Clinton Chelsea Handler was openly campaigning for Hillary Clinton Michael Moore was a Hillary Clinton fan even though he was more of Bernie Sanders guy the the fellow Dixon over her I believe he campaigned for Hillary Clinton no problem there for the left that's totally fine right celebrities campaigning for Democrats that's totally fine and you know you have Lamont Hill saying that it's just terrible that Trump would meet with all of these black celebrities to push his particular agenda for inner cities Leonardo DiCaprio was invited to the White House by Barack Obama to discuss global warming just back in October Angelina Jolie came to the White House and talked with Obama about Sarajevo Angelina Jolie like the Tomb Raider person right Brad Pitt at the same time that she was meeting with with with President Obama Brad Pitt was talking with Vice President Biden about New Orleans rebuilding Brad Pitt about New Orleans because I guess one time he'd been to New Orleans they know no one really understands okay during the 2008 Obama actually sought advice on the Middle East from George Clooney yes George Clooney the guy from see Rihanna and Tomorrowland right and Mark Lamont Hill obviously had no problem with Meryl Streep ripping on Trump it's also worth noting by the way Martin Luther King during that during the march on Washington he reached out to tons of celebrities Joseph mankiewicz and Charlton Heston and James Baldwin and Paul Newman and Jackie Robinson and Joan Baez and Bob Dylan and Sammy Davis jr. and Harry Belafonte and Ruby Dean Burt Lancaster if you look at the pictures who's all celebrities tons of celebrities there are some in Selma many in the march on Washington and the left was fine with that so let's not pretend that suddenly they've erected this barrier between celebrity and politics that's absolute nonsense the reason Lamont Hill is really pissed is because for the left the left is the the entire Kenmore superiority unearned moral superiority of the left is based on the unsupportable unsubstantiated belief that they're the sole representatives of minority interests in America that they stand up for these discrete and insular minorities against the evil American system and so when there are black people who say well you don't stand for me then they've got a problem because it sort of undermines their own identity well they can trout if they can't represent all black people then what exactly are they representing what do they stand for what if what if a lot of black people say well we don't need your help we're fine America is a good place we hope that Trump does well well then they get very very upset and they get to call people mediocre Negroes it's funny mark Lamont Hill once said that black people are incapable of racism because they don't have the institutional power in order to in order to be responsible for racism well Mark Lamont Hill certainly has the institutional power to be racist against Steve Harvey a race is not politics race is not politics just because you're white doesn't mean that you vote because you're white according to white interest just cuz you're black doesn't mean you vote because you're black according to black interests sometimes people say well if you're Jewish you're expected to be pro-israel right because Judaism is an actual religion ethnicity is not important to me your actual religious practice is the same thing is not true of your color your color your birthplace none of that matters when it comes to politics but the left has to insist that all of that matters when it comes to politics and so they have to cast out all traders from the hall and that means that obviously people like Jim Brown and and Steve Harvey they have to be thrown aside because Marc Lamont Hill thinks their mediocre Negros never mind that Steve Harvey by the way has an audience of 4 million people on his radio show every day and is worth about a hundred million dollars he's a mediocre negro he's a mediocre Negro as opposed to Marc Lamont Hill who's tonight sat him on CNN really quite disgusting and and racially charged we'll get some more of that in just a second but first we have to direct your attention to another podcast that you should subscribe to right now on iTunes or stitcher or Wonder EECOM wherever you listen to podcasts and that podcast is called terms ok so this is a drama podcast that's that's what it is it's a it's a podcast that's fictional and it's really entertaining I've listened to it really exciting really entertaining so political podcast sort of a political thriller really well produced an interesting to listen to the basic premise is this we voted in America votes in a really controversial president and the two-term exiting president decides that he wants to do something to stop this guy from taking office and what ensues from there is really fascinating is constitutional crisis the sort of manipulation that goes on behind the scenes as somebody who loves politics and somebody who also loves political fiction terms is a great piece of work and you should definitely take a listen you can subscribe again at iTunes stitcher Wondra com or wherever you listen to the podcasts it really is quite addictive so they

the way that you would imagine they would react Sean Spicer of the RNC he comes out he says look John Lewis started all of this you know all the left is very upset that Trump is attacking John Lewis John Lewis is the one who dropped the bomb here it wasn't Trump let's talk about the latest battle we've just been reporting on between the president-elect and Congressman John Lewis the president-elect attacking John Lewis's district his service to this country we're looking at four days to the run-up of the inauguration was this the proper way to handle this or the tamron I want to just take it back a step Cameron because I think you know congressman Lewis started this with your own Chuck Todd by saying that the election was illegitimate and that president elect Trump was an illegitimate president so let's see where it started which is you have this icon of voting in civil rights claiming that an election was illegitimate when there is zero evidence of that everybody has confirmed that the election was duly held there was no tampering with anything and they see somebody of John Lewis's stature and iconic nature who has worked so hard to enfranchise people and talk about the getting people involved in our voting systems and and in getting and talking about the integrity of our voting system to then go out when the candidate of his choice doesn't win and try to talk about the deal atomization of the election is frankly disappointing okay and Sean Spicer is exactly right now and we're gonna have to break here on Facebook and YouTube but in a second we're gonna talk about why Sean Spicer and Trump actually gets a right why Trump is popular with Republicans and why Marco Rubio actually gets it wrong on John Lewis and Trump which is something that is you
