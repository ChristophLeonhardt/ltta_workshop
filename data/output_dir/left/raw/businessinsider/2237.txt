00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,909
and outside is a great place to do yoga

15
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,159
I'm a college student I don't have very

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,510
much money and then this was like the

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,979
first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that popped up and i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

18
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,459

19
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:55,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's amazing to be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relax in your</font>

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,629
day literally in the busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> center of the</font>

21
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,729
universe and just kind of find a moment

22
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,539
of people just to have a sense of

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,399
everything just like meeting different

24
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,670
kind of cultures and other people the

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,710
New Yorkers I recently moved here so and

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,420
you doing something good for your bodies

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think it ends up becoming a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,289
bit contagious so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ends up</font>

29
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,969
being nice people are curious and they

30
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:19,799
look and they watch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then maybe next</font>

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,090
time they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and join</font>

32
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,500
if I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be held</font>

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,850
today I definitely would have brought my

34
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,970
yoga mat and my of my apparel to join

35
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,490
them join the group I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have I saw a</font>

36
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,590
couple of that amounts to bitch

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,640
the warm message can do to it right it's

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,899
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more interesting because</font>

39
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,880
you see the buildings you see the

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">landscape of the area so it's just you</font>

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,689
wouldn't expect to see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I can see</font>

42
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,549
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works no China I think I were the</font>

43
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,469
appropriate clothing for yoga especially

44
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:55,979
if I notice out here I make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

45
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">check the rearview mirror when I</font>

46
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,869
purchase yoga wear and make sure if not

47
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,319
my cops along that would cover any areas

48
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,780
i wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expose there's</font>

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about with some brand like</font>

50
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,099
Lulu something and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually made a</font>

51
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,250
recall on those but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,430
haven't seen one yet I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if it</font>

53
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,799
feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable then you're good to go</font>

54
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:23,220
but yeah I think that I'll be more aware

55
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,829
we live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in New York State you be who you</font>

56
00:02:25,829 --> 00:00:00,000
are and do you do what you like to do
