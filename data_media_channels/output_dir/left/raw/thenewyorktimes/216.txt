1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,660
The hardest part of getting to Mars

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,200
is sticking the landing.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,933
On the 26th of November, 2018,

4
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,930
NASA's InSight spacecraft will plunge

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,066
into the thin Martian atmosphere

6
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,133
at over 14,000 miles an hour.

7
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:21,200
An alien fireball over the red plains.

8
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:25,266
InSIght will pop a supersonic parachute,

9
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,966
drop its heat shield and prepare to touch down.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,229
In the past, Martian rovers have bounced

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,100
and rolled to a stop inside huge airbags,

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,960
or floated to the surface

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,400
hanging from an elaborate sky crane.

14
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,600
But InSIght will touch down on rockets,

15
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,933
"Just the way God intended,"

16
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,566
in the words of the mission's lead scientist.

17
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,566
If all goes well, and it arrives in one piece,

18
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:56,433
the lander will unfurl its solar panels and get to work.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
InSIght won't send back any dramatic images.

20
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:04,066
Its mission is to look down,

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,800
into the geological heart of the planet.

22
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,233
A seismometer will listen for vibrations and rumbles,

23
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,300
marsquakes and meteorite impacts.

24
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,230
This detector is so sensitive

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,466
it can sense movements smaller than the width of an atom,

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,266
or feel the faint tidal groundswell

27
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:27,233
from the gravity of the tiny moon Phobos.

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,000
A second device with a pointed spike

29
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,900
will hammer itself 15 feet into the ground,

30
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,166
to measure heat flowing up from the planet's core.

31
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,733
Mars today is a craggy, frigid desert,

32
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,700
but once it was wet and warm.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,066
What InSight learns could give us hints

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,566
about the structure of other rocky planets:

35
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,633
scarred Mercury,

36
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:54,933
clouded Venus,

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,200
and our own dynamic Earth,

38
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,833
which is too large and too active

39
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,166
to have kept the traces of its early formation.

40
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,229
And perhaps it will even tell us about

41
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,333
the billions of rocky worlds orbiting other stars.

42
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,900
Over the past two decades,

43
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:18,066
three generations of rovers have toured Mars.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,866
They have scraped and poked,

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,500
scooped and sampled,

46
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:25,666
dusted and drilled into Mars's surface.

47
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,366
InSight will stay in one place,

48
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,633
but dig deeper and listen longer.

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,066
It may provide clues

50
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,733
to why Mars was once habitable,

51
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,233
why and how it changed,

52
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,833
and what that might mean for Earth.

53
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,266
For our old sibling Mars,

54
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,933
Earth represents the road not taken.

55
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,933
The road to life, blue water

56
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,300
and green mountains.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,900
Home to a species now curious enough

58
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,466
to send machines to investigate

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,100
and interrogate nature's choices.

60
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,633
To understand how we got lucky

61
00:03:05,633 --> 00:00:00,000
with a garden world.
