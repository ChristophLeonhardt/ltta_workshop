after Bryan Cranston was rather critical of Donald Trump while he was a candidate running for president but what does he think about Donald Trump today well recently The Hollywood Reporter caught up with Cranston and during the discussion he said something pretty interesting that I think a lot of people even those who have been critical of Trump can get behind here's what he had to say president Trump is not the person who I wanted to be in that office and I've been very open about that that being said he is the president if he fails the country is in jeopardy it would be egotistical for anyone to say I hope he fails to that person I would say fuck you why would you want that so you can be right he continues to say I don't want him to fail I want him to succeed I do I honestly do and if you've got a good idea that helps the country oh man I'm gonna support you I don't care if you're a Republican and I'm a Democrat or whatever we've got to get away from this idea that our country's political football and someone with a different opinion is the enemy assume they love this country as much as you do and there's always room for improvement how can we make it better so look I actually agree with him I when he got inaugurated I didn't want him to fail I thought maybe maybe he'll surprise us because he didn't strike me as someone who really had an ideology during the campaign he struck me as someone who just wanted to win and would say whatever it would take to win but unfortunately I believe that he's failed us with a number of different things that he's done from his childish juvenile behavior on social media to you know all of this healthcare stuff to the transgender ban which by the way because it's been a crazy news week we didn't get to the story but a federal judge blocked a portion of that and you know all the other things and pretty soon tax cuts for corporations I don't want him to fail I want him to succeed but unfortunately what I predict actually happened or what I predicted actually happened and what I wanted to happen has not happened okay so let me both defend and disagree with Bryan Cranston first of all why am i defending him with two counts one I like him I love him as an actor and he I agree with him politically he's and he even said he'd moved to Canada of Trump won that's what I was helping but don't say that you're moved to Canada any of course he didn't move to Canada I was at a two-minute conversation with him and I was so happy okay I'm super real about my bias okay and but more importantly I like this sentiment I'd like to send him in that you want the country to succeed no matter who's right and especially the part that I love about this his idea is it's not about your ego so if we get to a better place but you were wrong about it that's great okay no problem at all and I say that all the time I make predictions on the air and then I usually they're disastrous and I go I hope I'm wrong and from time to time of course I am for example well one of my hopeful predictions about Trump and it was about the only hopeful prediction about Trump was that he's so counterintuitive and unpredictable that he might actually be able to get a deal between Israel and Palestine I remember that right and I've been wrong it's done anything about that and it is very unlikely that you will but Kushner's got that yeah he's got an on lockdown that's right okay now the parts that I disagree with so know there are parts that I definitely hope that he fails at and not failing for the country but failing with his agenda so if he wants giant tax cuts for the rich which he does my answer that is I'll be polite and say hell no I hope he fails disastrously epically on that because I think that creating an extra two billion dollars in debt just so that they can transfer wealth to the top is a disastrous idea for the country it would be good for his agenda it would be great for his donors and it would be terrible for the country so on the other hand I hope that he succeeds with North Korea hey if he if he fails with North Korea and we started disastrous war millions of people die I don't want to be right about that I you know and and I'm not saying that that that is gonna happen but with Trump he's so unstable it could happen and I'm scared to death that it's gonna happen if somehow miraculously not only does he not screw up North Korea but he somehow topples Kim jong-un without a shot fired and North Korea is free I would be ecstatic and I would give him all the credit in the world right but but the last part of this is look he unfortunately because he's a good guy cranston still thinks that they're having a legitimate debate in congress and there's a debate of ideas and there's good people on both sides know there's checks on both sides campaign checks an independent expenditure oh I like that line so so there is the Republican politicians not the voters but the Republican politicians are not interested in in the debate they're not interested in any of that there's no exchange of ideas here they are paid its private financing for private interests they're paid for those tax cuts and the deregulation they just be regulated the bank's so they could rip off customers and not have to deal with class-action lawsuits that's gonna cost customers billions of dollars I hope they fail spectacularly in that unfortunately they are succeeding and it is hurting the actual American citizens you are way too nuanced bro like this is not your so funny because look it depends on how you measure success and and my interpretation of what he said was you know I hope generally speaking you know he succeeds in doing the right thing and leading this country on a better path I don't think he thought about all of the specific proposals and you know hoping that those specific proposals actually get implemented because look when Trump was running for me I felt like a lot of those proposals were just hollow because he had no details like you would just say things that were insanely vague and you know he would sometimes I think play to an evangelical or conservative base but I just thought okay he's saying those things to get elected he's not really gonna do it but no he's actually pushing for those specific proposals so I agree with you I don't want him to succeed in those specific proposals at least implementing them but I think if I'm not mistaken Cranston just means I hope he succeeds and he does the right thing but it's your interpretation no no and he comes down from a right place I'm not trying to criticize Cranston you're right I'm being too nuanced bro okay but last thing on this is that unfortunately it is still a misplaced hope there is no scenario in which Donald Trump sees the light okay I have definitely experienced that feeling of despair like yeah there's no there's no like Dianne Feinstein recently was talking about like oh I think maybe you could turn around and do some good things lately yeah they're not turning around there's no good things so if we're wrong about that wonderful okay but that is very unlikely as so Krantz has hearts in the right place and again I hope I'm wrong but I really really doubted Trump does not have good intent and if he succeeds in his policy proposals it'll be nothing but terrible news for America if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network dot-com sighs joy
