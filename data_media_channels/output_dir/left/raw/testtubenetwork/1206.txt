00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,789
Last week, an off-duty St. Louis police officer
shot and killed an 18 year old male.

2
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:06,789
This is in

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,620
the wake of the Michael Brown shooting that
happened two months ago, and it brings up

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,620
yet

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,849
another important question: Exactly what powers
do off-duty police officers actually have?

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,030
The rules vary between police departments,
and they’re actually more guidelines than

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,030
they are

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,030
rules.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,189
But there is one hard and fast law covering
the rights of off-duty police officers.

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:31,210
The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of
2004 allows active and retired police officers

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,210
who

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,110
served for at least ten years, to legally
carry concealed weapons at all times, regardless

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,110
of

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,720
jurisdiction, or local and state laws.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,110
But there are a few restrictions.

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,930
Officers can’t be in a Gun-
Free School Zone, they can’t be under the

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,850
influence of drugs or alcohol, and they can’t
be under

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,710
disciplinary action.

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,810
They also can’t carry a weapon if they were
forced to leave the department

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,160
due to mental instability.

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,390
That’s it.

22
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,140
That’s the only codified law specific for
off-duty Police Officers.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
But there are a lot of

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,390
commonly accepted guidelines that most departments
follow.

25
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,840
Most of them allow their officers to

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,700
“moonlight” or take second jobs, even
allowing them to wear their uniforms while

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,700
doing security

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,700
work.

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,219
But there are limits.

30
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,770
Officers who want to work a second job do
so with permission from

31
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,770
their department.

32
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,670
And some departments don’t allow certain
types of jobs, like bartending or

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,080
stripping.

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,979
Most off-duty officers are allowed to make
an arrest or question a citizen, but in order

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:26,979
to do so

36
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,289
- they have to present proper identification
and follow all current police rules - which

37
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,289
of course

38
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:33,630
has its limits.

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,740
Off-duty officers cannot use their powers
to resolve personal grievances.

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,740
For

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,509
example, if the neighbor of an off-duty officer
is playing their music too loud, that officer

42
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,509
cannot

43
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,580
go next door and issue a noise citation.

44
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,229
This is according the International Association
of Chiefs

45
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,770
of Police.

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,780
Police are also advised against using their
powers to fight minor crimes, like parking

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
or traffic

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,780
violations.

49
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,899
They also shouldn’t pull anyone over while
in an unmarked vehicle, except in extreme

50
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:00,899
circumstances.

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,840
For example, some off-duty officers will stop
an obviously drunk driver.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,680
On the whole though, most police departments
caution against officers doing police work

53
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
while

54
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,940
off-duty, mainly to protect the city from
liability lawsuits.

55
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,390
If an off-duty officer does something

56
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,520
illegal or unethical after identifying himself
as a member of the department, the city he

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
works for

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,880
could be held accountable.

59
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,420
Which is why many cities, like Philadelphia,
suggest that if an off-

60
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,890
duty officer sees a crime, they should simply
call 911.
