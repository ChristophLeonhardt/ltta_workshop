1
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:04,249
STOP DROP AND THEN REGAIN POWER.

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:07,052
AND THAT'S THE ANGLE.

3
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:09,287
JOINING US NOW REACTION FROM

4
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:10,522
BOSTON, JEFF BEATTY, RETIRED

00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,757
DELTA FORCE OFFICER WHO ALSO

6
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:13,391
WORKED AS A COUNTERTERROR

7
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,094
OFFICIAL AT THE CIA.

8
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:20,065
AND I DON'T -- IDAHO, FORMER CIA

9
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:20,932
OPERATIVE MIKE BAKER AND HERE IN

10
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,034
WASHINGTON, RISIBLE, FORMER

OBAMA DEFENSE DEPARTMENT

12
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:26,404
OFFICIAL AND CURRENT SENIOR

13
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:27,372
FELLOW AT THE NEW AMERICA

14
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:27,772
FOUNDATION.

15
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:29,474
GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU.

16
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:33,245
MIKE, I BELIEVE YOU TRAINED WITH

17
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:33,545
GINA.

18
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,080
YOU CAN GIVE US A LITTLE INSIGHT

19
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,452
INTO HER AND HER EXPERIENCE.

20
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:43,054
WE DEMONSTRATED HOW DUPLICITOUS

21
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:44,589
THE DEMOCRATS ARE.

22
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:45,323
THEY SUPPORTED BRENNAN AND NOW

23
00:00:45,323 --> 00:00:46,591
SUDDENLY GINA HASPEL IS A

24
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:46,925
PROBLEM.

25
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:49,828
BUT GINA HASPEL, HER WORK ETHIC,

26
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:52,864
HER EXPERIENCE, WHO SHE IS AS A

27
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:53,965
PERSON, YOU KNOW THIS WELL.

28
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:55,233
>> YEAH, WE WERE IN TRAINING AT

29
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,968
THE SAME TIME.

30
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:59,070
WHAT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO,

31
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,305
THE BEGINNING OF OUR RESPECTIVE

32
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:00,639
CAREERS.

33
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,475
SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS EXCELLED WHERE

34
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:04,976
YOU COULD ARGUE MINE WAS

35
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:05,477
SOMEWHAT MEDIOCRE.

36
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:06,244
LOOK, EITHER WHAT YOU SHOULD BE

37
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:09,281
DOING IS TAKING THIS MONOLOGUE,

38
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:11,850
THE ANGLE, AND PUTTING ON A

39
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,251
CONTINUOUS LOOP BECAUSE IT IS

40
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:13,785
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

41
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:17,956
THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THEY ARE

42
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:21,026
ABLE TO NOW DRAW A SHARP DIVIDE

43
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,027
BETWEEN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS

44
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:22,927
FOR JOHN BRENNAN, WHO I DO HAVE

45
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,664
A LOT OF RESPECT FOR.

46
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:27,098
WHILE EXPERIENCE OFFICER.

47
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:28,867
UNLESS THEY HAVE SOME DIFFERENT

48
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,468
STANDARDS FOR A MALE DIRECTOR

49
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:31,670
DESIGNATE AND A FEMALE DIRECTOR

50
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,337
DESIGNATE, AND I CAN IMAGINE

51
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:34,673
THEY DO.

52
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,808
THEN HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY EXPLAIN

53
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,076
THIS OTHER THAN, AS YOU POINTED

54
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:39,144
OUT, THE DIFFERENCE IS TRUMP.

55
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:42,480
AND I FOUND MOST INTERESTING OF

56
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,748
THE OPEN QUESTIONS THAT WERE

57
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:44,416
ASKED YESTERDAY IN THE OPEN

58
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,284
SESSION OF THE HEARINGS, THESE

59
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:49,087
QUESTIONS ABOUT, HOW DID YOU

60
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:50,455
FEEL ABOUT IT?

61
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,390
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT IT?

62
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,925
WHAT REALLY COUNTS WHEN YOU'RE

63
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,327
TALKING WITH THE INTEL COMMUNITY

64
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:56,461
AND THE MILITARY AND

65
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,462
LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHAT ARE THE

66
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:00,098
LAWS ON THE BOOKS AT THAT TIME.

67
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:03,468
HOW SOMEBODY FEELS ABOUT IT

68
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:05,070
FRANKLY, I DON'T CARE.

69
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,804
AND I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN

70
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:08,406
PUBLIC REALLY CARES WHAT THAT

71
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:08,806
FEELS ARE.

72
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:10,074
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF A COMBAT

73
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,876
BRIGADE OR YOUR OPERATIONAL

74
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:12,944
PEOPLE AND YOUR INTELLIGENCE

75
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:13,878
COMMITTEE GO OUT AND BASICALLY

76
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:14,979
ARE MAKING THEIR DECISIONS IN A

77
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,615
VISUALLY ON HOW THEY MAY FEEL?

78
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:18,316
>> Laura: THE VALUES QUESTION

79
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:19,918
CAME UP A LOT.

80
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:22,354
ROSA, I WANT TO GO TO YOU.

81
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,322
EVEN PEOPLE VERY CRITICAL OF

82
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:25,256
THIS PRESIDENT, PHILMONT, THE

83
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:28,493
CIA ANALYST ON CNN, HE WAS

84
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:31,463
ASKED ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS'

85
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,064
VALUES QUESTIONS TO GINA HASPEL.

86
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,699
HE SAID YOU THINK THIS IS MORAL

87
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,668
WHAT WAS BEING DONE.

88
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,870
SHE STAYED ON THE MORALITY

89
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,537
QUESTION.

90
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:40,638
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID.

91
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:43,708
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THE PREVIOUS

92
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,743
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES WERE

93
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:45,076
IMMORAL?

94
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,611
>> SHE SPOKE ABOUT AMERICAN

95
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:47,979
VALUES AND SHE SPOKE ABOUT RULE

96
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:48,313
OF LAW.

97
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:49,481
I APPRECIATE WHAT SHE VOTES ON.

98
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,683
SHE CAN VOTE HOWEVER SHE WANTS.

99
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:52,283
I DON'T APPRECIATE THE

100
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:55,653
COLLECTIVE AMNESIA.

101
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,655
>> Laura: COLLECTIVE AMNESIA,

102
00:02:57,655 --> 00:02:59,457
OBVIOUSLY REFERRING, AND AGAIN

103
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:00,959
THAT'S A CONSISTENT CRITIC OF

104
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,893
THE PRESIDENT, COLLECTIVE

105
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:03,862
AMNESIA ON THE PART OF DEMOCRATS

106
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,063
WHO VOTED ENTHUSIASTICALLY FOR

107
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:05,497
JOHN BRENNAN.

108
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:06,898
>> LAURA, I THINK YOU'RE

109
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:09,601
HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT

110
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,802
HYPOCRISY AND SPINELESS THIS ARE

111
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:11,970
BIPARTISAN VICES HERE.

112
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,138
I AM DISAPPOINTED IN GINA

113
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:13,705
HASPEL.

114
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:15,473
I THINK SHE DIDN'T ANSWER A

115
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:16,207
STRAIGHT QUESTION AND SHE OWES

116
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:17,041
US AN ANSWER TO THE STRAIGHT

117
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,177
QUESTION DO YOU THINK IT'S

118
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:19,511
IMMORAL.

119
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,379
SHE DODGED IT COMPLETELY.

120
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,015
BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

121
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:24,749
DO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SOFT

122
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:27,285
PEDAL THIS ISSUE?

123
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:28,386
WE ARE SEEING SCRUTINY OF GINA

124
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:28,720
HASPEL.

125
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,355
I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT WHAT

126
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:31,456
DILEMMA DEMOCRATS ARE FACING.

127
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,057
THE IRONY HERE IS THE DEMOCRATS

128
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:34,859
LIKE THE FACT THAT GINA HASPEL

129
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,060
IS NOT AN IDEOLOGUE.

130
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,262
SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL.

131
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:38,430
SHE'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO'S

132
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,798
CONVEYANCING I WANT TO ADVANCE

133
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:40,398
THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA.

134
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:41,666
SHE IS SINGLE FROM I JUST WANT

135
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,101
TO ADVANCE THE AMERICAN AGENDA.

136
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:44,469
DEMOCRATS LIKE THAT ABOUT HER A

137
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,237
LOT MORE THAN THEY LIKE MANY OF

138
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:48,273
TERMS POLITICAL APPOINTEES.

139
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:49,741
BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT IF YOU

140
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,676
WANT THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO EMBRACE

141
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:54,045
SOMEBODY WHO SEEMS TO HAVE

142
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:54,712
EMBRACED TORTURE, WHICH

143
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,247
DEMOCRATS AREN'T --

144
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:57,649
>> Laura: SHE DIDN'T DESIGN

145
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:58,049
THE PROGRAM.

146
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,651
>> WELL, LAURA.

147
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,187
I HAVE TO THROW THE CHALLENGE

148
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:02,654
FLAG.

149
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:04,756
>> Laura: JEFF IS COMING IN ON

150
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:05,857
US WITH THE CHALLENGE FLAG.

151
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:08,359
>> I'VE GOT TO THROW THAT

152
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,161
CHALLENGE FLAG, ROSA.

153
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:12,664
TORTURE IS A PROPAGANDA WORD.

154
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:15,400
THAT'S A PROPAGANDA AND IT'S

155
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,702
CHOSEN TO EVOKE AN EMOTIONAL

156
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:18,470
RESPONSE.

157
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,271
IT'S CHOSEN TO CONJURE UP IMAGES

158
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,706
OF PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE RACK OR

159
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:25,043
CUTTING OFF FINGERS OR LIMBS.

160
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,044
LET'S BE ACCURATE.

161
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:29,280
LET'S NOT BE PROPAGANDA.

162
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,050
IF YOU TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE AT

163
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,451
GEORGETOWN TO USE PROPAGANDA

164
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,719
TERMS, YOU'VE GOT TO -- I DON'T

165
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,021
ALLOW MY STUDENTS USE LOADED

166
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:40,091
THING WHICH LIKE THAT.

167
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,259
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS.

168
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:42,660
IT'S NOT THE RACK.

169
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,229
IT'S NOT CUTTING PEOPLE'S

170
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,263
FIGURES OFF OR LIMBS OFF.

171
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:45,797
IT'S WATERBOARDING.

172
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,098
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

173
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:47,966
WATERBOARDING, LET'S TALK ABOUT

174
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,400
A VERY LET'S NOT GO FOR THE

175
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,835
SPECIFIC TO THE GENERAL.

176
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:51,569
AND THE GENERAL IS GENERALLY A

177
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,171
LOT MORE HEINOUS THAN WHAT WE

178
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,240
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

179
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,975
>> Laura: BUT JEFF, I THINK --

180
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:57,308
HOLD ON.

181
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:58,877
I THINK WHAT ROSA IS SAYING IS

182
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,178
THERE IS A CONVENTION AGAINST

183
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:00,879
TORTURE.

184
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,681
THERE IS A U.N. CONVENTION

185
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:04,148
AGAINST TORTURE.

186
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:04,983
HOWEVER WE SHIFTED OUR

187
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:08,052
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT MEANS

188
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:10,421
AND AFTER 9/11, WE WANTED THE

189
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:10,822
INFORMATION.

190
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,391
AS YOUR FORMER COMMANDO

191
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,526
EXTREMES, WE WANTED THE

192
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:15,793
INFORMATION TO STOP THESE

193
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:16,127
ATTACKS.

194
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,295
IF ANYONE OF US WHO HAD A KID

195
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,297
WHO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED AND ONE

196
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:20,498
PERSON KNEW WHERE OUR CHILD WAS,

197
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:21,533
WE WOULD SAY DO WHATEVER YOU

198
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,067
HAVE TO DO TO GET THAT

199
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:23,468
INFORMATION.

200
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:25,136
WE WOULD SAY THAT AS PARENTS, WE

201
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:25,503
KNOW THAT.

202
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:27,705
>> YES, YOU WOULD.

203
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:29,407
>> IT'S LIKE HAVING A PET DOG

204
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,141
AND YOU TRAIN THE DOG TO BRING

205
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:32,944
THE PAPER TO YOU AND THE DOG

206
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:34,579
DOES WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO,

207
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,681
FOLLOWED YOUR INSTRUCTIONS, AND

208
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,383
NOW YEARS LATER, YOU BEAT THE

209
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:38,917
DOG WITH THE PAPER.

210
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:41,920
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, IS IT

211
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,220
LEGAL?

212
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,256
IT WAS, AND SHE DID LEGAL

213
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:45,857
PROCEDURE.

214
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:48,059
IT WAS INVESTIGATED TWICE.

215
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,060
FOUND TO BE LEGAL.

216
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,362
>> Laura: SHE IS EMINENTLY

217
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,864
QUALIFIED.

218
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:55,667
TO BE CIA DIRECTOR BY ANY FAIR

219
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,669
INDICATION OR EXAMINATION OF HER

220
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,269
BACKGROUND.

221
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:00,772
WHAT SHE FEELS AS A PERSON IS

222
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:04,742
FRANKLY NOT RELEVANT TO HER JOB

223
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:06,511
AS A PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE

224
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:08,479
THAILAND BLACK SITE.

225
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,047
HER FEELINGS.

226
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,081
WHAT IS THAT MEAN, YOUR

227
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:10,448
FEELINGS.

228
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:14,686
IT SUCH A DEMOCRAT, LIB WAY.

229
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:16,421
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS?

230
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:19,057
ROSA HAS TO GET BACK IN.

231
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:19,857
MIKE, HOLD ON.

232
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:20,258
ROSA FIRST.

233
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:22,060
>> THIS IS NOT MY PROPAGANDA

234
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,660
WORD.

235
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,261
THERE'S REAL IRONY HERE.

236
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:24,963
IT'S FUNNY TO ME HOWEVER IS TALK

237
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:26,064
ABOUT THE WORLD WAR II

238
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:27,699
GENERATION IS THE GREATEST

239
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,499
GENERATION, SO AFTER

240
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:29,200
WORLD WAR II WHEN WE FACED AN

241
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,803
ABSOLUTELY EXISTENTIAL THREAT,

242
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,705
WE PROSECUTED IN THE TOKYO

243
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:35,073
TRIBUNALS TO MOWING PROSECUTOR

244
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:35,707
JAPANESE SOLDIERS FOR

245
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:36,908
WATERBOARDING U.S. SOLDIERS, AND

246
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,676
WE CALLED IT TORTURE THEN.

247
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:40,545
THE SAME WAY WE HAVE CALLED IT

248
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,113
TORTURE CONSISTENTLY.

249
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:42,880
THAT'S WHAT THE LAW CALLS IT.

250
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,915
IT'S NOT WHAT I CALL IT.

251
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:46,184
THERE IS A BRIEF PERIOD IN THE

252
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:47,385
BUSH OF ADMINISTRATION WHEN SOME

253
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:48,386
OF DICK CHENEY'S LAWYERS DECIDED

254
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:50,421
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CALL IT

255
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,122
TORTURE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO

256
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:52,490
BE ABLE TO DO IT.

257
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,691
THAT WAS REPUDIATED A FEW YEARS

258
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,460
LATER, EVEN BY THE BUSH OF

259
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:55,927
ADMINISTRATION.

260
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,528
>> Laura: CHENEY STILL SAYS WE

261
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:58,329
SHOULD BE DOING WATERBOARDING.

262
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:01,866
CHENEY WAS OUT THERE TONIGHT.

263
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:02,300
[ALL SPEAKING]

264
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,435
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE NOT

265
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:08,573
CONCERNED THAT IT WAS APPLICABLE

266
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:09,440
CONCERNED THAT IT WAS APPLICABL

267
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,841
APPLICABLE.

268
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:10,508
>> Laura: LET ME GET TO MIKE

269
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:11,242
FIRST AND THEN WE WILL GO BACK.

270
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:11,876
>> THANK YOU.

271
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:14,145
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE GOING

272
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:15,680
THROUGH THIS AND RELITIGATING IT

273
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,715
AGAIN WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS IS

274
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:19,083
EMINENTLY QUALIFIED IN THIS

275
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,685
POSITION AS GINA HASPEL'S.

276
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:21,452
LOOK, WHAT THEY DID SO WELL,

277
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:25,256
THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN WHEN THIS

278
00:07:25,256 --> 00:07:29,060
WAS FRONT BURNER TOPIC, THE FAR

279
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,727
LEFT SEIZED THE MORAL HIGH

280
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:31,996
GROUND AND SAID EVERYTHING

281
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,665
EXCEPT TALKING TO A DETAINEE IS

282
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,667
TORTURE.

283
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,268
EVERYTHING.

284
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:38,670
NOW, I UNDERSTAND, OBVIOUSLY

285
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,204
IT'S AN EMOTIVE SUBJECT BUT

286
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:40,905
FRANKLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

287
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:42,874
THERE ARE AREAS, IT'S LIKE

288
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:43,374
EVERYTHING ELSE.

289
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:44,876
IT'S NOT THIS WITHOUT.

290
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,277
THERE ARE AREAS, AND THEY'VE

291
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:48,046
OBVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS

292
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:48,613
ENHANCED INTERROGATION

293
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:50,882
TECHNIQUES, THAT EXISTED.

294
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:51,849
MAY I REMIND YOU OF THE

295
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,085
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, OFFICE OF

296
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:56,854
LEGAL COUNSEL, WE DID ON THIS

297
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:57,555
REPEATEDLY AND CLEARLY AND ON

298
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,290
AND VIGOROUSLY.

299
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,024
AND NOW THAT INFORMATION PASSES

300
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:01,159
TO THE GENERAL COUNSEL.

301
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:02,527
THE AGENCY THAT WAS DISSEMINATED

302
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:03,094
TO THE FIELD.

303
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,729
CAN I POINT OUT ONE OF THE

304
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:05,029
THING.

305
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:09,267
THERE'S A WELL-WORN PATH BETWEEN

306
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,468
LANGLEY WHERE THE CIA

307
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:11,469
HEADQUARTERS IS AND

308
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,205
CAPITOL HILL, BACK IN 2002 AND

309
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:17,875
2003 GOING TO THE TALKING TO THE

310
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,309
GANG OF EIGHT.

311
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:19,677
>> Laura: I MADE THAT POINT.

312
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:20,311
THEY WERE BRIEFED.

313
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,914
NANCY PELOSI LEARNED ABOUT AT

314
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:23,681
THE SAME TIME GINA DID.

315
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:24,115
JEFF.

316
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:26,984
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HER

317
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:27,985
NICE ANOTHER ASPECT OF WHAT YOU

318
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,654
BROUGHT OUT IN THE ANGLE.

319
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,657
TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS IS MORE

320
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:33,357
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THAN IT IS

321
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:35,460
ABOUT GINA HASPEL.

322
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,193
AND EVEN INTO THE REPUBLICANS

323
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:40,664
INVOLVED IN THIS, SALUTE TO

324
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:41,466
SENATOR McCAIN.

325
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:42,232
HE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED ME BACK

326
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,702
MIDDAY TO RUN FOR SENATE WHICH I

327
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:45,069
DID.

328
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:46,804
MAYBE I SHOULD BE MANAGING FOR

329
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,673
THAT BECAUSE I GOT MY CLOCK

330
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:49,674
CLEANED HERE AGAINST JOHN KERRY.

331
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:51,342
I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR

332
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,911
HIM AND EVERYTHING THAT HE WENT

333
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:54,245
THROUGH.

334
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:56,214
BUT I THINK HE'S LETTING HIS

335
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:58,483
ANIMUS AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP

336
00:08:58,483 --> 00:08:59,717
BLEED OVER INTO THIS.

337
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:01,786
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HE IS A STRONG

338
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:02,987
DISLIKE FOR THE PRESIDENT, AND

339
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:05,857
WHEN HE SAYS DON'T COME TO MY

340
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:07,291
FUNERAL, THAT'S A STRONG

341
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:07,625
DISLIKE.

342
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,327
AND I'M AFRAID THAT HE'S SO

343
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:11,229
RESPECTED THAT OUT OF RESPECT TO

344
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:13,264
HIM, THAN OTHER REPUBLICAN

345
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,333
SENATORS MAY ACCEDE TO HIS WISH

346
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,568
THAT IT DOES KNOW MANY OF

347
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:19,270
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT GET

348
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:19,670
CONFIRMED.

349
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,105
AND I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE, AND

350
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:22,206
I HOPE THAT HE WILL CHANGE HIS

351
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:22,974
MIND ABOUT IT AND I HOPE HIS

352
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:25,343
COLLEAGUES WILL RECOGNIZE SHE'S

353
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:25,877
A PROFESSIONAL.

354
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:27,879
IT'S LIKE IF YOU'VE GOT A GREAT

355
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,880
GROUP OF PEOPLE, YOU WANT SOME

356
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,748
BUT HE KNOWS HOW TO BEST USE

357
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:31,082
THEM.

358
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:32,483
NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN SHE HOW

359
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:33,684
TO GET THE BEST OUT OF THE

360
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:34,685
AGENCY, AND WE ARE TODAY SHE'S

361
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:36,587
GOING TO RESPECT THE LAW.

362
00:09:36,587 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Laura: GUYS, WE COULD HAVE
