THAT ARE GOOD.

00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:17,279
WE HAVE TO DO WELL IN THE

JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS KEVIN

HE IS LIVE FROM ROANOKE,

GRAHAM ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE.

22
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:04,426
I WONDER WHAT TOOK PLACE AROUND

23
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,128
THE KAVANAUGH HEARING IMPACTED

24
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,164
THE MID THERM ELECTIONS.

25
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:09,999
YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE

26
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,135
COUNTRY AND RAISING A LOT OF

27
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:12,435
MONEY.

28
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:16,272
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

29
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:18,508
>> WELL, WHEN YOU DO HAVE

00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:21,244
LINDSEY GRAHAM ON, THANK HIM.

31
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:25,381
SO MANY PEOPLE SAY TELL LINDSEY

32
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:25,882
GRAHAM THANK YOU.

33
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:28,584
WHAT HE SAID IS WHAT MILLIONS OF

34
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:29,952
AMERICANS WERE THINKING.

35
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,687
I'M FINDING PRIOR TO THE

36
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,756
KAVANAUGH HEARING THE INTENSITY

37
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,358
LEVEL WAS ON THE DEMOCRATIC

38
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:35,658
SIDE.

39
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:38,561
MORE DEMOCRATS WERE WANTING TO

40
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:39,896
VOTE THEN REPUBLICANS.

41
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:41,397
REPUBLICANS THOUGHT THERE WASN'T

42
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,198
A NEED.

43
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:45,334
IN THE LAST WEEK THERE HAS BEEN

44
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,170
A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT.

45
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,739
PEOPLE ARE UPSET.

46
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,010
NOT JUST HOW KAVANAUGH WAS

47
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,012
TREATED BUT DR.  FORD.

48
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:59,782
THEY HELD THIS LETTER

49
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:08,958
ACKNOWLEDGED YOU GOT -- IT.

50
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:13,729
THE INTENSITY HAS INCREASED.

51
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,531
FOR ALL OF YOUR VIEWERS.

52
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:17,266
IF THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES AND

53
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,734
THINK ABOUT NOVEMBER 7th.

54
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,636
IF WE WORK UP AND THE DEMOCRATS

55
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:23,139
TOOK THE MAJORITY WHAT YOU

56
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,007
WATCHED LAST WEEK WILL BE

57
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,943
INTENSIFIED FOR THE NEXT TWO

58
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:27,476
YEARS.

59
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:29,745
WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT

60
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:35,618
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAVING SOCIAL

61
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:35,985
SECURITY.

62
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,820
IT WOULD BE HEARING AFTER

63
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,957
HEARING AFTER INVESTIGATION AND

64
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,258
INVESTIGATION.

65
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:44,527
THE ECONOMY WOULD COME TO THE

66
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:45,061
STOP.

67
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,631
THAT'S AWE VIEW OF WHAT WOULD

68
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:49,031
HAPPEN.

69
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,500
>> ANY IDEA THINGS CHANGE THESE

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,603
LAST FEW WEEKS WHEN WE SAW THE

71
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:56,806
LEFT RAMPING UP ATTACKS.

72
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:59,175
YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELINGLY

73
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:01,811
SPEAKING WITH VOTE IRES.

74
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,747
THIS WEEKEND YOU WERE AT

75
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:05,214
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

76
00:03:05,214 --> 00:03:06,749
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY ABOUT

77
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:08,918
THAT AND ARE YOU SEEING THAT

78
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:10,987
REACTION AND NUMBERS MOVE.

79
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:13,356
OVER THE PROCEEDING WEEKS A LOT

80
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:16,659
OF PEOPLE SAY IT'S IN THE BAG.

81
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,227
HAS THAT CHANGED.

82
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:22,465
>> I THINK IT'S CHANGED

83
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:22,865
DRASTICALLY.

84
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:26,269
WE LOOK AT THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS.

85
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:27,437
THAT'S INCREASED.

86
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:33,977
WE LOOK AT VOLUNTEERS COMING IN.

87
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:37,313
REPUBLICANS ARE AT A

88
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:37,814
DISADVANTAGE.

89
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,949
DEMOCRATS HAVE TWO LIBERAL

90
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,184
DEMOCRATS.

91
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:48,758
YOU HAVE MIKE BLOOMBURG WHO

92
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:52,528
PROMISED $80.

93
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:55,698
TOM WHO HIGHWAYS SPENT $120

94
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:56,933
MILLION.

95
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,168
HE BRAGGED ABOUT HIS LIST BEING

96
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:02,839
LARGER THAN THE NFL.

97
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,308
THEY ARE GIVING YOU A WINDOW

98
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:08,177
INTO WHAT THEY WOULD DO.

99
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:08,778
>> NONE THE LESS.

100
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:11,714
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

101
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:18,387
TERMS OF MONEY RAISING.

102
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:26,563
WE WERE SUCCESS.

103
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:29,165
RERAISED -- WE RAISED $15

104
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:29,732
MILLION.

105
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:31,968
THAT'S WHY HOW DO WE EQUAL THE

106
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:34,137
PLAYING FIELD?

107
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:35,672
RESULTS VERSES RESISTANCE.

108
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:39,109
THE RESULTS ARE BETTER THAN THE

109
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,043
LAST 50 YEARS.

110
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,546
MORE JOBS THEN PEOPLE LOOKING

111
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:42,946
FOR.

112
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:45,382
THE LARGEST PAY RAISE ON

113
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,617
MILITARY IN NINE YEARS.

114
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:49,987
FUNDING THE MILITARY BACK FROM

115
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:58,228
IN CUTS UNDER THE OBAMA

116
00:04:58,228 --> 00:04:58,829
ADMINISTRATION.

117
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,998
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE V.A.

118
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:04,568
OR THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE BILL

119
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:06,703
THAT JUST PASSED THE HOUSE AND

120
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:07,804
SENATE.

121
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,240
WE HAVE 112 PEOPLE THAT WILL DIE

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:19,116
TODAY BECAUSE OF ADDITION.

123
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:21,184
THE SAD PART IS NOT ONE DEMOCRAT

124
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:24,921
VOTED FOR THAT TAX BILL.

125
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:27,124
NOT ONE IN THE HOUSE OR SENATE.

126
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:28,759
THEY ALSO RESISTED IT.

127
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,461
THEY RESISTED ALLOW PEOPLE TO

128
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:34,164
KEEP MORE OF THEIR OWN MONEY.

129
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:37,834
>> WE KNOW NANCY SAID IT'S JUST

130
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:38,168
CRUMBS.

131
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,604
WE JUST SAW THIS PAST WEEK

132
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:43,307
ANOTHER GDP OF BETTER THAN 4%.

133
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,442
WE ARE KICKING OFF THE EARNING

134
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:50,047
SEASONS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE AT

135
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:50,948
22%.

136
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:54,117
EARNINGS AND GROWTH IS ANOTHER

137
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:55,018
STRONG QUARTER.

138
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,687
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT GOES TO

139
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,422
SOME OF THE RALLIES.

140
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:04,261
IT ENERGIZES HIM TO HERE IT

141
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:07,631

>> WELL, I'M IN VIRGINIA.

163
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,544
ONE RACE IS BARBARA.

164
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:57,314
WHEN YOU LOOK AT 41 OPEN SEATS

165
00:06:57,314 --> 00:06:58,816
WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE RETIRED.

166
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,618
I LOOK UP IN MINNESOTA.

167
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:03,287

THEY FOCUS ON THE DISTRICT.

IF YOU GO ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU

THE IMMIGRANT CAME.

186

THEIR DEMOCRATIC COMPONENT HAS

187
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:57,174
BEEN ACCUSED FOR SEXUAL

188
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:58,109
HARASSMENT.

MANY FEEL THEY AREN'T GETTING A

00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:42,486
FAIR SHOT.

213
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:44,121
THEIR CONSERVATIVE VOICES ARE

214
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,991
NOT BEING HAROLD.

215
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,193
I KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.

THIS PAST WEEK YOU HAD A MEETING

219
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,234

00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,307
>> I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE BIAS

223
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:05,844
THAT COMES ACROSS IN SOCIAL

224
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:06,211

225
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,880
WE WATCHED THEM WHERE THEY SAT

226
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,049
THEIR AND SOME CRIED TEARS.

227
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,918
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THEIR

228
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:15,487
OWN MEMOS OF A SILENT DONATION

229
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,656
OF HELPING AND USING THE

230
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:18,023
INTERNET.

231
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:20,325
HOW CAN GOOGLE USE THAT.

232
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:23,228
90% OF ALL SEARCHES GO THROUGH

233
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:23,829
GOOGLE.

234
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,564
95% OF THE PEOPLE DROP OFF WHEN

235
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:30,836
IT COMETS -- COMES DO THE SECOND

236
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,236

I SAT DOWN WITH THE CEO.

238
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,149
WE SPOKE ABOUT PRIVACY ISSUES

239
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,885
AND THEIR WORK WITHIN CHINA AND

240
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,487
WORK WITH THE MILITARY.

241
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,522
IT WAS A GOOD MEETING.

242
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,524
HE PLEDGED TO COME BACK TO A

243
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:53,358
HEARING.

244
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:55,160
GOOGLE HADN'T BEEN THERE BEFORE

245
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,029
AND I HAD GREAT CONCERN.

246
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,797
WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

247
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:03,235
IT COMES TO TWITTER OR AMAZON OR

248
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:03,602
FACEBOOK.

249
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:07,072
THESE ARE GREAT INFLUENCE.

250
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,707
TWO-THIRDS OF ALL ADULTS GET

251
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:10,575
THEIR NEWS FROM THE INTERNET.

252
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:13,211
WHEN YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS AND

253
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,781
AFTER WE HAD THE HEARINGS WE

254
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,282
FOUND CONSERVATIVES THAT WORK IN

255
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,150
THE BUSINESSES.

256
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,818
THEY HAVE SPOKEN UP.

257
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,754
A SENIOR ENGINEER PUT TOGETHER

258
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,490
HIS OWN GROUP.

259
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,859
HE FELT LIKE HE COULDN'T SPEAK

260
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,193
HIS OWN BELIEVES.

261
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:33,265
YOU HAD JACK, THE CEO THAT SAID

262
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,901

00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:35,968
CONSERVATIVES WEREN'T SAFE.

266
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,336
THAT'S THE BIAS YOU HAVE TO

267
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:37,636
STOP.

268
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,639
YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY.

269
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,575
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T TO BRING

270
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,511
THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHERS FROM

271
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,580
SILICON VALLEY INTO WASHINGTON.

272
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,949
>> WILL YOU BE ABLE TO MAKE A

273
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,851
CHANGE HERE?

274
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,421
DO YOU BELIEVE GOOGLE WILL MAKE

275
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:55,754
CHANGES?

276
00:10:55,754 --> 00:11:00,192
IF YOU GOOGLE GOP CALIFORNIA

277
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,595
IDEOLOGY IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

278
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,598
THAT CAME UP WAS NAZIISM.

279
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:10,970
SOMEONE PROGRAMMED THE ALGORITHM

280
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,539
OR DO YOU THINK LEGISLATION WILL

281
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,642
MAKE THE COMPANIES SMALLER.

282
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,544
>> I EXPECT CHANGE TO HAPPEN.

283
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,181
TO SAY MY PARTY WAS NAZIISM.

284
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,117
NOT THE PARTY OF LINCOLN OR

285
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:25,851
REAGAN.

286
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,654
THEY SAY THAT HAS TO DO WITH

287
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,289
WIKIPEDIA.

288
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,959
I MED WITH HIM TWO WEEKS AGO

289
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,193
WHILE OUT OF SESSION.

290
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,228
AFTER THAT MEETING, I DIDN'T

291
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,029
REQUEST IT.

292
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,598
HE WENT BACK AND WROTE A LETTER

293
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,968
ABOUT NOT PUTTING THEIR BELIEFS

294
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,736
BEFORE THE COMPANY.

295
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,538
THEY HAVE TO STOP THE BIAS

296
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,138
THROUGHOUT.

297
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,776
WE WATCHED JACK DOORCY SAY THEY

298
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,747
WEREN'T SHADOW BANNING.

299
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,817
THEY DID SHADOW BAN.

300
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:04,624
THEY ARE LIVING IN A BUBBLE.

301
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:17,937
THE ALGORITHM IS THERE.

302
00:12:17,937 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WILL GIVE YOU FOUR
