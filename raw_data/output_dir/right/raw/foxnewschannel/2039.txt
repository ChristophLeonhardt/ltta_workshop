1
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:15,083
>> Neil: WARREN BUFFET

2
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,752
CONSIDERED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

3
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:18,287
INVESTOR ON THE PLANET ADMITS

4
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,189
HE'S NOT PERFECT.

5
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,291
ALTHOUGH HE'S MADE BILLIONS FOR

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,527
HIS INVESTORS, HE ALSO LAMENTS

7
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:29,431
REAL MISSING REAL BEAUTIES LIKE

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,365
MISSING TECHNOLOGY STOCKS

9
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:32,401
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

10
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:32,801
TECHNOLOGY.

11
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:35,571
I MADE THE WRONG DECISION ON

12
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,372
APPLE AND AMAZON AS HE SAID THIS

13
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:38,440
PAST WEEKEND.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,143
HE APPARENTLY MADE UP FOR IT ON

15
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:43,145
APPLE REVEALING HE'S BOUGHT 75

16
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:44,746
MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S

17
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,281
STOCK IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND

18
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:47,049
COULD BUY MORE.

19
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,117
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING ABOUT

20
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,752
AMAZON, BUT HE READILY ADMITTED

21
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,721
TO BEING PUT OFF ON THEIR HIGH

22
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:53,422
STOCK PRICE.

23
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:55,591
NOW HE SAYS THAT WAS STUPID AND

24
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,859
SO WAS HE.

25
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:57,559
IMAGINE THAT?

26
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,995
SINCE HE JUST ESTIMATED AMAZON'S

27
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:01,830
ABILITY TO DISRUPT RETAIL AND

28
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,266
CLAUDE COMPUTING AT THE SAME

29
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:05,567
TIME.

30
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,769
WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT HIS

31
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,571
WORDS, BUFFET FELT THE NEED TO

32
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,572
SHARE THEM AT ALL.

33
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,709
NO INVESTOR IN HUMAN HISTORY HAS

34
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,811
COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO HIS

35
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,946
SUCCESS OR SPOTLIGHTED SO MANY

36
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:18,313
SUCCESSES.

37
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,782
THERE'S WARREN SCREAMING TO THE

38
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:24,386
WORLD, I'M NOT INFALLIBLE.

39
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,822
I'VE HAD SOME DOOZIES.

40
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,290
BUFFET LIKES TO REMIND FOLKS

41
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,725
ABOUT THOSE DOOZIES.

42
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:32,361
THE TIME HE BOND CONOCO PHILLIPS

43
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:34,730
FOR $2 AND LOST A BUNDLE AND

44
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,965
THEN THERE WAS U.S. AIR.

45
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,767
NEVER MIND THAT HIS HITS HAVE

46
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:39,835
WALLOPED HIS MISSES.

47
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:43,572
HE DOESN'T MISS A CHANCE TO SAY

48
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,707
HE'S BEEN HIT AND HASN'T HURT

49
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:47,476
HIM A BIT.

50
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:50,846
FOR TWO RUNS.

51
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:54,182
FIRST, INVESTORS TRUST HIM.

52
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:55,617
AVERAGE FOLKS ARE ALL HUMAN.

53
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:56,618
WE'RE ALL HUMAN.

54
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:59,888
AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE ALL MAKE

55
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:00,255
MISTAKES.

56
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:02,991
I LIKE TO THINK WE TOLERATE,

57
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,693
ADMIRE THOSE IN PUBLIC LIFE THAT

58
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:05,260
ADMIT THEM.

59
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,596
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO JOHN

60
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:08,797
KENNEDY'S POLL NUMBERS AFTER THE

61
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,733
BAD BANKS FIASCO.

62
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,169
WHEN THE NEW PRESIDENT COULD

63
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:20,509
HAVE BLAMED HIS PREDECESSOR FOR

64
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,577
THE INVASION.

65
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,278
BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN POLL

66
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,614
NUMBERS WENT UP AFTER THAT.

67
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:26,581
SO TIED WITH RONALD REAGAN AFTER

68
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,651
THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR.

69
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:36,391
HE SAID THE MATTER WAS ILL

70
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:37,526
CONCEIVED AND ALL ON HIM.

71
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,727
FESS UP FROM YOUR MISTAKE.

72
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:40,028
LEARN FROM THEM.

73
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:43,131
IT SERVED ABRAHAM LINCOLN WELL

74
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,400
WHEN HE WENT THROUGH UNION

75
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,870
GENERALS LIKE TISSUE PAPER.

76
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,841
HE SAID EVENTUALLY IT GET I'D

77
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,775
RIGHT.

78
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,043
AND HE DID.

79
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:58,447
AND LEE IACOCCA SAID JAPANESE

80
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:06,588
CARS WOULD BE MORE RELIABLE THAN

81
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:06,855
HIS.

82
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,423
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A TIMELY

83
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:08,757
MESSAGE.

84
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:10,225
JUST ASK WARREN BUFFET.

85
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,894
HE'S MADE A PRETTY GOOD FORTUNE

86
00:03:12,894 --> 00:00:00,000
STICKING TO IT, EVEN AS HE HAS
