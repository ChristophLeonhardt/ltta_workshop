uncomfortable at any point anything well not really I mean it's one of those things where you gotta understand like you imagine in this there's not a lot of black people here which is fine you just understand it's gonna be that awkward look but in terms of uncomfortable because of safety and I haven't seen anything at all that there's no reason for people to feel like that history may have failed to deliver the anticipated win but the Kenyan red left the Russian capital firmly being the part of the Russian Reds folklore join us up to the break where we're behind the scenes of the first el clásico outside of Spain for 35 years and the first ever in the United States a very warm welcome back now football's not just a game anymore we know that it's a huge commercial enterprise making

important for the American game - yeah you build off the Boca like you've seen the crowd it's great I was here for the PSG game the other night good crowd they're right here there you go when I'm at

the cargo you come all the way from shy town for this game why is the classic order first time in the country as someone turned to me when it was three to two and they were still going back and forth and up and down he said maybe you should have charged more in front of this kid of course we charged it up as you can see the place of coming back people had a fantastic time here in Miami and it kicks off the 2017-18 season which will finish in the Luzhniki stadium Moscow it may be some of these players in the World Cup final now to a story that has rocked English football to its foundations both Ania leuco and Leon Sanderson of women's England internationals with over 150 appearances between them for England the English Football Association were basically accused of offering a leuco money to hide a story of racist comments allegedly made by former manager Marc Sampson respond to Sanderson who gave evidence to the British Parliament as the story grew you recently went to Parliament in the United Kingdom because there's a situation whereby the England women's manager a man made comments that were deemed to be racially sensitive you gave evidence to that any a black England international of 100 caps gave evidence as well do you feel that the Football Association in England is institutionally racist and does it need to change immediately I think people can come to their own conclusion as to why these things have happened to me any true Spence any Horizonte you know whether it's a fact that they're doing it on purpose however they're doing it subconsciously it happened I think this has been going on for years it's not just the situation with any it's happened a lot of times where people have actually said in the men's game women's game this has happened then it gets to a certain point and it gets knocked down you know so for example the stuff that myself in any of mentioned a lot of people can relate to it whether you're man woman had white what did you in any mention in your in your evidence what were the issues for you well the issues for me was that whenever you raise something towards them wherever it be something that happened to me where they forgot about my fiftieth cap in China and I knew it was my 50th cap that day I knew it was my 50th cap on that trip and I was really excited to be there be selective get my jersey get a video message from home mark knew how vulnerable I was in that situation if that makes sense so for him to bring me back in and then forget about my 50th cap really hurt me a lot of like journalists and stuff like that have said to me it must have been a click it must have been you guys were getting racially abused no it wasn't like that you see it wasn't like that it wasn't a culture necessarily of racism because there's not that many black players on the team so therefore how can it be a culture of racism but the point is those players that were made to feel that way there's a pattern you know there's a pattern that comes around and I just don't know why people haven't hopefully now people can see you know what goes on but at the same time I would welcome a meet in with the FA I would welcome and meet in with mark I'd love to know why these things happen because like I said we all make mistakes but how do you make them better and I don't think they did a good enough job of making it better you've got an opportunity now to sit down with mark to sit down with the Football Association and to to get to a conclusion where everybody hands up we made a mistake there's no malice in this it's what we are we've we're an organization that needs to move with the times you're helping us to do that what would your recommendations be just a couple please just take responsibility for what happened we all make mistakes but how do you make those mistakes rectify those mistakes going forward that's what I would say because I don't hate anybody I don't hate mark I don't hate the Football Association we want this to never happen again to somebody else this went on going for 18 months plus you know it's not about being the victim it's not about kind of I don't know shouting from the rooftops about this this is something that was supposed to be confidential but it's not until newspapers start breaking stories that weren't true that that's when it didn't become too confidential but mean any have gotten spoken about this every single day and I've known what she's been through and it's been absolutely disgraceful but at the same time nobody I'm I had a phone call from anybody from the Football Association Awards we were at no you're joking I had one phone call from anybody anybody and I've also not been contacted since I was injured I got picked up an injury last year tore my ACL meniscus didn't hear anything from anybody nothing from the doctor no support or anything what did I do do you tell me what I did they forgot about my 50th cap I was seeing that they were going out on team activities on Instagram and I contacted the team psychologist and I said what's going on here and he said I was I was I was told you couldn't make it and then that was after that then I found out on Twitter I wasn't selected for England that she believes Cup do you want to play for the for the lionesses again that's a good question because I can't categorically say yes or I can't say no but at the same time I wouldn't be able to plan these circumstances you know people say people as a player you've played people gonna love you people gonna think you're awful that's the part of the job but my thing is that can you honestly say that every single player on that team is better than the ones and you know when people have freedom it doesn't mean they're the best players in England as weird as that sounds well where every national team it is sometimes if your face fits then you get selected that's not to say that the players are not good because they're all good players on the team but I just think they do things to manipulate the public's perception of what actually is the reality and that's what sometimes I have a problem with how do I go from being one of the most high-profile players on the team it's never happened imagine Henry Caine not that I'm saying I'm Harry Kane but imagine if he just got taken out the team completely taken up the team it wouldn't happen in the men's game because people would be saying in question why is he not selected and he got taken out the team when she was top goal scorer in the league we need the women's game to continue to grow and that means people taking this long hard look at themselves and how do we make this bedtime genuinely wanted to make it better not just saying it and then behind closed doors saying okay we'll just keep going on and we'll keep this quiet and then hopefully they'll forget about it I don't think this is going to be forgotten about where would you like to see the women's game going what do women men football people football bodies football administrators do to give it the next push on well I think the fact that we're sitting here right now I don't think that we would have been able to be in a position where you'd be interviewing a female footballer 15 years ago so I think that in itself is a positive not because of you but with the way the media is operating but I've always said if you don't know about something how can you go to it if you don't know about a concert at the o2 how are you going to go to that concert so it's about publicizing the game and I still think it can continue to grow and hopefully with more media exposure but the good media not the stuff that's negative that everybody wants to talk about and stuff like that we want to have people with the same journalists that have been interviewing me I said I hope to see you at the World Cup in France in two years time supporting the lionesses not just because of negativity because you want to be there I think we just have to continue to grow the game and obviously what's happened to blake hopefully that won't deter people from getting involved in the game and that won't stop girls young girls or boys because it isn't what I like about it now it's not a matter of boys the copter girls where's the copter me not before it'd be like just little girls you know but now it's men men come up to me so many people come up to me shaking my hand saying Liam well done you know I hope you break planes soon off my injury and stuff like that so it's nice for people to recognize you for the right things not the wrong things Liam thank you so much for joining us on the show you've spoken more sense in 20 minutes than many people at our Football Association is having 20 years thank you so much and all the very best for the future thanks dad I appreciate it thank you you're welcome thank you for joining us on the Stan Collymore show I'll be back for more of the same next week hope you join us for Italy
