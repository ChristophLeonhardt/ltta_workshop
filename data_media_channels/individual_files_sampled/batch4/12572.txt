according to The Daily Beast today first daughter Ivanka Trump secretly met with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards in January the story does not make clear whether the meeting took place before or after Trump's inauguration but Ivanka is Trump's most trusted advisor along with her husband Jared Kushner and she's a moving force behind much of the action in his administration according to The Daily Beast quote the purpose of the meeting from Cecile's point of view was to make sure that Ivanka fully understood what Planned Parenthood does how it is funded and why it would be a terrible idea for Planned Parenthood to be removed from being able to see Medicaid patients had dawn Logan's a executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America the main thing that Cecile was doing was explaining that the money doesn't actually go to abortions we get reimbursed the same way a hospital does we were clearing up misinformation about how this works unquote Richards now says that Ivanka is part of the problem since she hasn't openly sounded off on her father's opposition to funding Planned Parenthood according to Richards quote anyone who works in this White House is responsible for addressing why women are in the crosshairs of basically every single policy we've seen in this administration it's worth noting that just yesterday Ivanka told Gayle King on CBS this morning that she sounds off against her father's policies all the time behind closed doors quote I would say not to conflate lack of public announcement with silence she explained so is Ivanka still something for Planned Parenthood behind closed doors Trump has made clear he's willing to use planned parenthood as a cudgel to motivate Republicans but he also spent months talking about all the non abortion great work Planned Parenthood does which accounts for minut fraction of the revenue Trump may have shifted his position for politics but if uncle probably hasn't she's a career leftist on a variety of issues from climate change to abortion to same-sex marriage her speech at the Republican National Convention was an ode to government-sponsored childcare as Stephen Miller of heat Street pointed out quote Ivanka has donated thousands of dollars to prominent Democratic candidates including Harry Reid Andrew Cuomo Eleanor Holmes Norton Kirsten Gillibrand Gavin Newsom Chuck Schumer Cory Booker Eliot Spitzer Hillary Clinton Senate and 2008 presidential campaign and just recently two New Democrats star senator Kamala Harris in the interest of fairness she did donate to McCain and Romney 2012 but according to sources contributions to Republicans make up less than 10% of her overall donations Ivanka was not even able to vote for her father in the GOP primary as she did not switch her party affiliation by the deadline Ivanka is the person closest to Trump's heart in this administration an administration filled with people with little political background but who compete to demonstrate their loyalty to the president Ivanka will not be trumped in this regard that means she may have her father's ear even on issues upon which they disagree and that is not

news of the day is that Devon Nunez who's or Devin Nunes I guess it's pronounced there's been a big debate in political circles how do you pronounce this guy's last name so Nunes I think is how it's actually pronounced Devon Newton's who the chair of the House Intelligence Committee he announced on Thursday he has recused himself from the committee's investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election now this poses a problem for the Trump administration because the Trump administration basically funneled all of the information about Susan Rice unmasking members of the Trump team in the Trump transition team they funneled all that to Nunes by bringing him to the White House and then he didn't update his House Intelligence Committee friends and foes and then he went back to the White House to update Trump so it looked like Nunes was working for Trump that was really what this came down to the reason that he is is recusing himself is because the House Ethics Committee has now put him under investigation now to be clear they're not investigating him because they're saying he's a tool of the White House they're investigating him because anytime somebody allegedly leaks classified information they are they they are investigated by law Nunes has explained in a statement that he is is not he's not recusing himself because he did anything wrong he says several left-wing activist groups have filed accusations against me at the Office of Congressional Ethics the charges are entirely false and politically motivated and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of US citizens and other abuses of power despite the baselessness of the charges I believe it is in the best interest of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conway with assistant from representatives trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney temporarily take charge of committees Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into the matter I will continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman and the the ranking Republican and Democratic members of the Ethics Committee issued a statement they said the committee is aware of public allegations that representative Devin Nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information in violation of house rules law regulations and other standards of conduct the committee pursuant to rule 18 a is investigating and gathering more information regarding these allegations so all of the leading Republicans from from kurayan have expressed confidence in Nunes and what's amazing about about all of this is that I actually think Nunes is doing the right thing here I said a while ago I thought that Newton should recuse himself after there are questions about whether who's working for Trump mainly because it overshadows the actual scandal here which is Susan Rice unmasking Trump officials and then disseminating that information widely to the Obama team does it mean that Devin Nunes did something terribly wrong no it doesn't mean the Devin Nunes did something terribly wrong the headlines are just not gonna be good the question here was basically it would be better for Nunes to stick it out through the House Ethics Committee and muddy the waters or would be better for him to step aside and hands it over to people like Gowdy and Conway and allow them to pursue the leaks investigation about Susan Rice and Mike Flynn clearly I think for Trump it is better for Newtons to take the bullet on this one and step to the side so I think that Devin Nunes did make the right call here don't pay attention to everybody who's saying this is obvious proof that he did something deeply wrong that's not right the House Rules command it's not even it's not even a just a possibility to natural command the house will say that if there's an allegation brought against you of leaking classified information they must investigate they have to investigate and they have to open an inquiry by law so it's not like they found something credible and then when afternoons they were forced to by the rules of the committee so don't pay attention it's a bit of a nothing burger don't pay attention to everybody who's making a huge deal out of noon stepping away not proof that he did anything wrong or that he was specifically working for Trump I thought that he should my my feeling was that after he went to the White House and learned all this stuff he should have updated the members of the House Intelligence Committee before running back to Trump to report it was that second trip to the White House that looked particularly bad and and I wish he hadn't done that but I don't know that he actually did anything wrong here and I think it's premature to say that he did okay in other news that surrounds the surrounds Trump Trump has done an interview with the New York Times and in this interview with the New York Times he is now saying that he wants to do a great infrastructure plan and on that side I will say we're going to have I been a tremendous Democrats apart so basically is looking for democrat support for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan and there were questions about whether a lot of this money was going to come from public-private projects so out here in Los Angeles we have public-private projects at places like the Grove and the Americana this is basically a lot of a lot of stadiums are public private projects you know places where people invest their private dollars and those are matched by a certain amount of government money still not my favorite thing but better than just pure public investment Trump says he doesn't even want the public private projects anymore because he can borrow money more easily and he knows what to do your money better than you know what to do with your money he says we may take that trillion and we may also in addition use public private but we're talking about an investment of a trillion dollars so he explicitly said that it's not gonna be two hundred three hundred billion dollars of public money and the rest private it will be a trillion dollars of public money and he said the reason for that is because he can borrow money so cheap well this was exactly what Steve Danon had been saying for a while was gonna be Trump's plan so the idea that Steve bandhans influence with the administration is over I don't think that's right I also think that it's not just bannon's idea Donald Trump made his name in life building really big things with other people's money that's what he's done his entire life build really big things with other people's money he's not gonna stop doing that now that he has trillions of dollars at his disposal and there are a lot of people on the right who seem okay with this sort of infrastructure spending you weren't okay with it when it was Obama and when Obama was spending eight hundred billion dollars on random crap it was bad it was called the stimulus plan and we said it's a waste of money this also is a waste of money the fact is that everybody talks about the interstate highway system is that it's gonna cost a trillion dollars to fix up the interstate highway system it doesn't cost a trillion dollars to fix up the interstate highway system plus it is worthwhile noting that states and localities have an interest in maintaining the interstate highway system since it carries all sorts of goods and products and services through their towns one of the great myths by the way of American politics is that the Eisenhower interstate highway system was some sort of magnificent creation that never would have happened if it hadn't been for the intervention of the federal government it's just not true people drove long before the 1950s this was a car country going back to the 1920s the interstate highway system cost a lot of money it drove right through towns it destroyed a lot of businesses if you ever see the movie Cars you know the Pixar movie Cars remember the whole movie is set in this little town called Radiator Springs which is off of Route and as you recall route 66 is basically abandoned well route 66 used to be one of the thoroughfares of American commerce right Nat King Cole had a whole song about get your kicks on Route 66 route 66 was an actual thing what happened is that the federal government built the i-40 the i-40 bypass route 66 all of these people who'd spent their life savings and all their time and money putting roots down around route 66 all of them were left behind and destroyed so when you talk about forgotten people there are a lot of people who are forgotten because of the interstate highway system or whose houses were completely bulldozed by the interstate highway system the case I'm making is not there shouldn't be an interstate highway system it's that states have an interest in connecting their state highway systems and most of this should have been absorbed at the local and state level so when people say we need lots of we need lots of infrastructure spending now because it was so great back in the 50s it wasn't that great back in the 50s it isn't that great now and when Trump does this routine what he really wants is to build big spectacular things he doesn't actually want to fix up the roads and bridges that matter per se he just wants to build big stuff so that he can stamp the big T on it and then say that he built something which is what a lot of these folks wanted to Obama wanted to do it obviously FDR made his name doing this it's not good policy there's another poll by the way as long as I'm gonna get all the bad Trump news out of the way it's beginning there's there's another poll that's out today that says the 40% of Trump supporters would back a single-payer health care system which just demonstrates what folks like me have been saying all along in the great damage the Trump could do and he hasn't done it yet but the great damage that it is possible for him to do is the soul-sucking of the Republican Party into a big government nationalist party as opposed to a small government Patriotic Party which is not quite the same thing well all of that said the big story of the day is is we'll get to the Republican chaos in a second but the big story of the day is what is gonna happen in Syria so if you've been watching the pictures that are coming out of Syria obviously they are horrifying we talked about this a little bit yesterday either there are all these pictures of dead children who have been gassed to death by the Bashar Assad regime and that comes just a few days after the Trump administration came out and said Assad would remain in power I'd said that's not a coincidence if it had happened under Obama I would have said the exact same thing I have a very simple standard when it comes to what I expect from my politicians and that is you know your word matters and what you say has credibility and it turns out that in foreign policy particularly it matters when you say things so from the fact that Trump's people said Assad will stay in power and then three days later he's gassing children I don't think that's any sort of major coincidence a survivor of a 2013 Syria chemical attack he's on CNN and he was talking about what he thinks Trump should do I mean just say a few words directly to presto you please me the chance please mr. president mr. president please please in the name of every woman and child and elder who got killed by the Assad regime please come in and help us don't make the same mistake that President Obama did you criticize the Obama for failing and to punish and act when Assad cross the red line now it's the moment of truth now you should show the world that those days are over we can't just keep living in this onion presidental crimes against humanity we just can't keep living like this I would personally love to come to the United States and meet you and tell you my personal story you know obviously the media is happy to put this sort of stuff on TV because they're saying you know Trump should do something there there are two questions here one whose fault is all of this and - excuse me what should President Trump do right now those are the two big questions it's pretty clear that this is Obama's fault it's pretty clear this started under Obama that it was Obama who was saying for years and years and years that we had disarmed the Assad regime he proclaimed himself a massive political genius for having drawn a red line then backed away from the red line after Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against his own people and then he said that he had disarmed Assad and left Assad in power while Assad continue to gas folks John McCain correctly says this is Obama's legacy yes obviously as we all are appalled could I make two points one this is a legacy of Barack Obama the last time this happened Barack Obama said they crossed a red line called me and Lindsey Graham down in the White House and we're gonna and did nothing you know one thing worse than doing nothing is saying you're going to do something is the most powerful leader on earth and doing nothing so this is a legacy of Barack Obama and it's been going on now for the intervening four years so what we need to do we need to stop Bashar Assad's planes from flying and we can do that easily you have been bringing this issue up to the forefront I know it's been a great frustration for you I got to go but just very quickly our safe zones management again Brock had an opportunity to stop this and would have long ago and he took a hike and that's a terrible legacy okay and McCain is exactly right and listen McCain is no friend of trumps when he says this is not Obama you can trust the tenor McCain is exactly right on this this certainly is on Obama but that doesn't answer what we should do now I'm gonna discuss that in just a second but first I don't want to say thank you to our advertisers over
