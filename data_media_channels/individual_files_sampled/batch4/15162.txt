could the police be held liable for making lawful arrests well the United States Supreme Court is deciding that right now and I'm gonna break it down for you now this might be one of the most critical most important cases the Supreme Court has ever heard because it goes directly to the heart of Public Safety police officers on patrol responding to calls for help the case at issue is an incident in Washington DC where police were called at about 1:00 a.m. to a wild party neighbors called 9-1-1 probably couldn't sleep heard this crazy noise and all this insanity coming from this house and police respond when they get there they find bottles and garbage and use condoms strewn about they see women with cash stuffed into their thongs and the smell of weed is permeating the air now look I wasn't there I didn't speak to any the responding cops but having responded to similar incidents I'm guessing the cops were thinking prostitution drug dealing and all sorts of other nefarious activities but they started asking who's throwing the party some people said they were invited by a woman named peaches others gave different stories so the cops could hold the peaches who admits she invited some people but did not have permission to use the home they then hunt down and speak to the owner of the home who says no none of these people had permission to use my house so the police do what the police are supposed to do they arrest the people for trespassing and that's the heart of the case 16 of those arrested later sued the police and one they were awarded over a million bucks for having their rights violated by the police because they claimed the plaintiffs that they didn't know they weren't allowed to be in the home now look I have no problem with their criminal charges being dropped but the police did what they were supposed to do holding them personally liable is insanity it's insanity especially in light of them getting in touch with the owner of the home who said those people are not supposed to be in my home ress passing is a crime the man was right and the police were right but a liberal judge our liberal activist judicial system decided no we're gonna award the people who broke the law a million bucks and penalized the police and that's the issue the Supreme Court is hearing right now whether or not the police should be held liable for making lawful arrests on good information on a homeowner saying that's my home get him out of there they're there illegally this is really really disturbing stuff now we got an indication of the way the lefties on the Supreme Court we're gonna rule during arguments liberal Justice Stephen Breyer called it the Middle Ages he said it's a Middle Ages type mentality to think that partygoers should know who owns the home the Middle Ages you'd be responsible enough to know if you should or shouldn't be in a home or if you are in that home legally he thinks that's the Middle Ages god help us Elena Kagan another lefty on the Supreme Court bragged about going to similar parties but Justice Sonia Sotomayor takes the cake because she did with the left always does she infused racial identity politics and virtue signaling it he said well if the disease were wealthy white kids they never would have been arrested give me a break this was a predominantly black area the arrestees yes for black but so were the 9-1-1 callers the neighbors being inconvenienced I find justice Sotomayor yours comments racist what is she implying that black residents don't want the same peace and quiet at 1:00 a.m. that white residents do it's ridiculous and it's embarrassing to have that come from a Supreme Court justice but the more dangerous precedent here is that this now incentivizes if the Supreme Court rules in favor of this insanity which I don't predict they will I think the Supreme Court will realize the public safety implications and toss this thing out on its head where it belongs but hypothetically if they did the public safety implications are devastating because there's already precedent there's legal law there's case law that says the police have no duty to protect you it's an appellate case at Washington DC it's Warren V District of Columbia it says the police have no legal duty to protect you so now let's assume the Supreme Court upholds this nonsense and they say police can be held liable even when they do their jobs right in line with that state statutes you're a responding police officer there's a situation where you can arrest but you're not sure if the offender is aware that they broke the law but they did break the law according to the statute are you gonna take action if one option is take action make the arrest potentially be sued lose your pension lose your home and go bankrupt and not be able to feed your family or not get out of your vehicle and be shielded from liability by war in the District of Columbia I think most police officers are gonna stay in their cars and I can tell you in the big cities the unions are gonna tell them to do exactly that don't jeopardize your pension don't jeopardize your paycheck don't jeopardize feeding your family don't jeopardize your home and don't go into bankruptcy and potentially be charged criminally stay in your car because in your vehicle not helping anybody you're shielded from liability that's how dangerous of a precedent this could set that's how dangerous Public Safety will absolutely break down and cops I know are beside themselves I spoke to a few this morning one good friend of mine highly decorated detective he said this flies in the face of everything we learned in the Academy and on the street another one told me I don't know why anybody would want to be a cop in this environment and a third friend of mine said yeah well protect and serve is to come cover your own ass and they're right there are a hundred percent right to feel the same way this is absolutely tragic in the mere fact that a court somewhere allowed this a court somewhere found the police liable for lawfully doing their jobs is further evidence of the left's war on police it's ridiculous and all of society suffers if you
