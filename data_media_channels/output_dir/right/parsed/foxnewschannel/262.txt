GROUND ZERO, MEXICO BEACH.
YESTERDAY THIS WAS SOMEONE'S
HOUSE.
NOW FOLLOWING THIS DESTRUCTIVE
POWER OF HURRICANE MICHAEL IS AN
EMPTY SLAP FOUNDATION.
LOOKING AROUND MEXICO BEACH,
FRANKLY I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER
OF HOUSES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED
DOWN TO THE FOUNDATION OR RIPPED
OFF OF THEIR FOUNDATION THAT
BRINGS UP A POINT.
THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF THIS
HURRICANE LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT
WE USUALLY SEE WITH A TORNADO.
A TORNADO IS VERY FOCUSED IN ITS
INTENSITY.
THE AMOUNT OF GROUND IT COVERS.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THIS
HURRICANE IS THE DESTRUCTION,
JUST STRETCHES FOR MILES AND
MILES.
THE DESTRUCTION IS PLAIN TO SEE
HERE IN MEXICO BEACH.
WHAT IS UNKNOWN RIGHT NOW IS THE
HUMAN TOLL.
THE MAYOR HERE TELLS ME THAT
SOME 280 PEOPLE PLUS ELECTED TO
RIDE OUT THE STORM IN THEIR
HOMES.
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO WAY TO
COMMUNICATE WITH THESE PEOPLE.
THERE'S NO WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR
THEM.
SEARCH AND RESCUE IS UNDERWAY.
THE OTHER BIG JOB IS CLEARING
THE ROADS TO MAKE THAT SEARCH
AND RESCUE POSSIBLE.
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
DEBRIS IN THE ROADWAY.
AGAIN, VERY, VERY POWERFUL STORM
THAT CAME ASHORE.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE
NOTICED DRIVING IN WITH THE
HURRICANE, YOU SEE THE GROUND
GETS SOFT AND TREES GET TIPPED
OVER BECAUSE THE ROOTS CAN'T
HOLD THEM UP ANYMORE.
WHAT WE SAW DRIVING IN HERE IS
MILES AND MILES OF TREES SNAPPED
OFF AT THE TRUNK.
A POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF HOW
MUCH FORCE THIS HURRICANE
BROUGHT ASHORE.
>> THE OTHER BIG SITE ARE THE
POWER LINES DOWN IN THE ROADWAY.
THIS IS ALL OVER THIS SECTION OF
THE PANHANDLE.
WE DROVE IN ON I-10.
WE SAW HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
POWER TRUCKS THAT WERE STAGING.
THEY HAD COME IN FROM OUT OF
STATE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE TO GET
THE POWER LINING BACK UP AND
WORKING AND GET POWER RESTORED.
IT UNFORTUNATE.
AS YOU HEARD FROM THE LEADERS,
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE
PATIENT, SHEP.
>> Shepard: VERY QUICKLY.
I-10 HAS BEEN CLOSED ABOUT 80
MILES OF IT SO THEY CAN CLEAR
OUT DEBRIS.
DO WE KNOW IF IT'S REOPENED?
>> IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE
MAKING PROGRESS.
I SAW IT IN THE EARLY MORNING
HOURS WHEN THE IT WAS CLOSED AND
WE HAD TO COME OVER THROUGH THE
LOCAL ROADS.
I HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO
GO BACK.
