whatever you do don't go outside a quarter to 6:00 in the afternoon the cartels take PR and marketing very very seriously they really care about their images and when I was in Ciudad Juarez which is one of the places in Mexico that's seen a lot of fighting I was asking for safety tips from a guy there who ran the morgue in Juarez and he told me whatever you do don't go outside a quarter to 6:00 in the afternoon and I said well why is that and the reason is that a lot of the cartels time their murders at exactly that moment in order that they can lead the 6:00 p.m. evening news bulletin that's when they time their killings and it's because they want to be in the headlines they want to get the news it's used to intimidate their rivals sometimes they commit murders on another cartels patch in order to draw the army and the police to that area to make life harder for their rivals and this is all part of their branding it's all part of their PR you
