 STOCKS CLOSING
HIGHER THIS AFTERNOON, EDGED
HIGHER BY ENERGY SHARES.
RECORD HIGHS ACROSS U.S. STOCKS,
BUT IS THIS STILL A HEATED BULL
RALLY?
WE WILL GIVE YOU THE EVIDENCE
AND LET U.S. -- LET YOU DECIDE.
JOE: PLUS, A NEW KIND OF
GLOBALIZATION.
MARK: AND WE WILL LOOK AT THE
RESULTS FOR WALMART MEAN FOR
RETAIL.
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH OUR
MARKET MINUTE.
OIL AND HEARD A BULL MARKET.
IF YOU LOOK AT EQUITIES.
IT WAS KIND OF MEANDERING FOR
MUCH OF THE DAY.
JOE: MEANDERING IS RIGHT, BUT I
WOULD SAY IT'S A CONTINUATION OF
WHAT WE SAW DURING THE FED
MEETINGS YESTERDAY.
ESSENTIALLY, IT WAS A
SLOW-MOTION CONTINUATION.
MARK: I THINK MEANDER IS A GOOD
WORD FOR STOCKS.
I WANT TO START WITH A GROUP
THAT LED THE MARKET HIGHER.
WE TALKED ABOUT OIL GETTING INTO
A BULL MARKET.
HERE WE GO.
THE ENERGY INDEX HAS BEEN A
PRETTY BIG PART OF THE RALLY.
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH IT GAINED
TODAY.
IT WAS UP 60 BASIS POINTS AT ONE
POINT.
LEADING THE MARKET HIGHER, NOT
AS MUCH WEIGHT ON THE S&P AS IT
USED A HAVE, BUT STILL AN
IMPACT.
WE HAVE UTILITIES AND
FINANCIALS.
THESE ARE THE TWO THAT MAKE
HEADLINES EVERY DAY.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE MARKET
FEELS ABOUT INTEREST RATES RIGHT
NOW.
RIGHT NOW, WORK EXPECTATIONS
HAVE GONE DOWN.
FINANCIALS STILL HANGING IN
THERE.
I HAVE TWO COUP KIND OF FUN
STOCKS THAT POPPED UP TODAY.
PRIVATE PRISON STOCKS -- WE GOT
NEWS TODAY THAT PRIVATE PRISONS
WILL SHORTLY BE NO MORE OR AT
LEAST CEASED TO EXIST IN THE WAY
THEY DO NOW.
OBVIOUSLY, THE PRICE OF PRIVATE
PRISONS GOT CRUSHED.
JOE: PRETTY QUIET DAY ON THE
GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET,
CONTINUING YESTERDAY'S TRENDS.
LOWER TWO-YEAR AND 10 YEAR
YIELDS AS EXPECTATIONS OF SAID
POLICY CONTINUE TO EASE.
SCARLET: CONTINUE TO EASE, AND
THE DOLLAR DECLINED AS WELL.
THE POUND WAS A BIG JUMPER AS
HARD DATA OUT OF THE U.K. SHOWED
ONCE AGAIN THE ECONOMY HOLDING
UP BETTER THAN EXPECTED AFTER
THE BREXIT VOTE.
SO FAR, IF YOU TALLIED UP,
INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS,
AND RETAIL SALES HAVE ALL DONE
BETTER THAN FEARED.
THE YEN IS CURRENTLY BELOW 100.
YOU CAN SEE THE HEAD AND
SHOULDER PATTERN OUT THERE.
THE NECKLINE THERE, AND
ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG'S FX
STRATEGIST, THE NEXT CURRENCY TO
WATCH IS DOLLAR-YEN.
JOE: BOYLE IS UP 30% ON THE AIR.
IT FELT LIKE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OIL
BEAR MARKET.
NOW, IT IS BACK IN A BULL
MARKET, UP 22% FROM ITS LOWS AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH.
IT IS AMAZING TO ME HOW FAST THE
STORY CHANGES.
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, WE WERE
LIKE, THERE IS ALL THIS SUPPLY,
INVENTORY, SPILLING OUT OF THE
TANKS.
SCARLET: WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED
EARLIER THIS YEAR ON
SPECULATION.
MARK: IT'S A PRETTY BIG MOVE ON
HOPE.
SCARLET: YOU JUST NEED PEOPLE TO
BELIEVE IN IT.
THAT IS YOUR MARKET MINUTE.
LET'S TAKE A DEEP TIES INTO THE
BLOOMBERG.
YOU CAN FOLLOW THE FUNCTIONS AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.
TRY LOOKING INTO THE RETAIL
RUMBLE.
TARGET SALES DISAPPOINTED IN THE
COMPANY SAID U.S. SHOPPERS ARE
CAUTIOUS.
MEANWHILE, WALMART SAID
CONSUMERS ARE OK.
WALMART SHARES HAVE OUTPERFORMED
TARGET, AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN
THE RELATIVE SHARE VALUATION.
WHEN THE LINE GOES UP, SHARES
ARE INCREASING.
RIGHT NOW, WALMART'S SHARES ARE
AT A 20% PREMIUM TO TARGET
SHARES.
>> EACH HAS ITS OWN ISSUES.
SCARLET: LISTEN CAREFULLY WHEN
SOMEONE SAYS CONSUMERS ARE
CAUTIOUS.
MARK: TARGET IS STILL TRADING
BELOW AVERAGE.
SCARLET: GOOD POINT.
JOE: I AM LOOKING AT INITIAL
JOBLESS CLAIMS AS I DO EVERY
THURSDAY.
THEY KEEP IMPROVING.
THE WHITE LINE IS NOT JUST
SEASONALLY ADJUSTED CLAIMS.
THE DOTTED LINE IS THE MOVING
AVERAGE.
MOVING OUT TO GET A BROAD TREND.
ANOTHER POST CRISIS LOW ON THIS
MEASURE.
WE JUST DON'T SEE ANY SIGNS OF
LABOR MARKET WEAKNESS.
SCARLET: IS IT GOING TO BE A
BIGGER DEAL WHEN THE LINE STARTS
TO MOVE UP OR WHEN IT STARTS
FALLING?
JOE: IT TICKS UP FROM TIME TO
TIME, BUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT
IS CONSISTENT IS PRETTY
ASTOUNDING.
MARK: IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD'S
MOST BORING ROLLER COASTER.
JOE: GOOD ONE.
MARK: I AM GOING TO LOOK AT A
CHART THAT LOST, BUT I AM GOING
TO DOUBLE DOWN, RMB ON THE US --
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON THE
S&P 500.
I AM LOOKING AT THIS WITH THE
HELP OF MY COLLEAGUE, KEVIN
KELLY.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
COMPANIES AREN'T SPENDING AS
MUCH AS THEIR PROFIT MARGINS ARE
FALLING.
WE ARE BASICALLY SHOWING PROFIT
MARGINS GETTING THINNER AND
THINNER.
THIS IS A NORMALIZED CHART BACK
TO 2014.
PROFIT MARGINS HAVE SHRUNK BACK
TO 14%.
ONE THING HAS EXPANDED QUITE A
BIT, AND THAT IS RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT.
THIS SHOWS UP ON YOUR BALANCE
SHEET AND WILL EAT AWAY THAT
PROFIT MARGIN.
MAYBE COMPANIES WILL BE
REASSURED THAT THEY ARE SPENDING
A GOOD BIT ON RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT.
JOE: MOORE AND MCCARTHY JOINS US
NOW.
THANK YOU.
WE ARE HAVING A BIT OF A RALLY
HERE, NOT HUGE.
WHAT DID YOU LEARN YESTERDAY
FROM THE FED AND WHAT IS THE
CORRECT INTERPRETATION?
>> THE FED IS IN NO PARTICULAR
URGENT MOOD TO START RAISING
RATES.
THEY DO SEEM INCLINED THAT THEY
WOULD LIKE TO GET A RATE HIKE IN
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MINUTES
THAT SUGGESTED IT WOULD HAPPEN
AS EARLY US UP AMBER.
THERE IS STILL A WIDE RANGE --
AS SEPTEMBER.
THERE IS STILL A WIDE RANGE OF
INTERPRETATION ABOUT THE
ECONOMY.
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT, IF ANYTHING, BRAGS IT
MEANS FOR THE U.S. 
AND THEY ARE STILL SMARTING FROM
THE SPRING, WHEN THEY THOUGHT
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE
RATES, AND THEN DEVELOPMENT
PREVENTED THEM FROM DOING SO.
THE RISKS OF BEING LATE ARE NOT
AS BAD AS THE RISKS OF BEING
EARLY.
THAT IS THEIR AMMO -- M.O.
SCARLET: HE SAYS THE NEW NORMAL
MEANS ONLY 80,000 JOB GAINS
NEEDED PER MONTH.
WHAT DOES THE MORE HAWKISH FED
SPEAK ON THE HEELS OF DOVISH
MINUTES THREE WEEKS AGO TELL YOU
ABOUT THE FED'S CONFIDENCE IN
THEIR MODELS?
>> I THINK WHAT THE FED IS
TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS WALK A
FINE LINE BETWEEN BEING
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY --
BECAUSE WHEN THE CENTRAL BANK IS
OPTIMISTIC, IT'S EASIER FOR
PEOPLE IN THE MARKET TO BE
OPTIMISTIC, BUT AT THE SAME
TIME, STILL VERY CAUTIOUS,
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT 2-D
RAIL WHAT THEY HAVE ENGENDERED
HERE, WHICH IS A RECOVERY THAT
HAS LASTED QUITE A LONG TIME.
KEEP IN MIND, WE HAVE JACKSON
HOLE COMING UP, AND IT SEEMS
LIKE THE MESSAGE FROM JACKSON
HOLE IS GOING TO BE THAT THE FED
WANTS TO RESET THE FRAMEWORK IT
USES FOR IMPLEMENTING MONETARY
POLICY.
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON IT'S A
LITTLE DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER
WHAT THE MESSAGE IS BECAUSE IT
SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE CHANGING
THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD AND
CONSEQUENTLY HOW THEY WANT TO
AFFECT THE WORLD.
MARK: WE ARE LOOKING AT A FEW
METRICS HERE THAT THE FED
CONSIDERS INFLATION.
AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS.
EVERYTHING IS TRENDING UPWARD
OVER THE PAST YEAR, GETTING
CLOSER TO WHERE THE FED WANTS TO
BE AS WELL AS JOBLESS CLAIMS
STABILIZING AT A LOWER LEVEL.
IF YOU LOOK AT NOW VERSUS LAST
YEAR, THE PROBABILITY OF A HIKE
WAS SO MUCH HIGHER.
IS THERE SOMETHING WE ARE
MISSING?
>> I THINK THE MARKET HAS BEEN
LEARNING FROM FED BEHAVIOR.
THE FED TOLD US THEY WOULD RAISE
RATES FASTER AND MORE OFTEN THAN
HAS ACTUALLY OCCURRED.
MARKETS TEND TO LEARN BY DOING.
SAID FUNDS FUTURES CONTINUED TO
PRICE IN A RATE HIKE THROUGH THE
END OF 2017, WHICH IN THE VIEW
OF BUILD DUDLEY IS BEING
SOMEWHAT COMPLACENT, BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND, JAMES CAME OUT AND
SAID HE THINKS THE FED SHOULD
ONLY RAISE RATES ONCE OVER THE
NEXT TWO YEARS, WHICH IS
BASICALLY TELLING THE MARKETS
THEY HAVE IT RIGHT.
UNTIL THEY COME UP WITH A
UNIFIED MESSAGE, I THINK THE
MARKETS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO
TRADE OFF PAST BEHAVIOR, WHICH
MEANS THE FED WILL IMPLEMENT
HIGHER RATES SLOWER THAN THEY
SAID THEY WILL END LATER THAN
THEY SAID THEY WILL.
SCARLET: OF COURSE, THERE IS A
LOT OF SKEPTICISM OUT THERE
ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE MONETARY
POLICY IS IN THE U.S. AND AROUND
THE WORLD.
HERE IS WHAT PAUL KRUGMAN TOLD
US.
>> THERE'S AN ACCUMULATION OF
EVIDENCE THAT MONETARY POLICY IS
PRETTY INEFFECTIVE.
FOR A WHILE, WE CAME INTO THIS
THINKING 0% RATES WERE
INEFFECTIVE.
THEN CAME QE.
THEN CAME NEGATIVE RATES.
IT TURNS OUT THERE WERE ALWAYS
THINGS THE CENTRAL BANK COULD
DO, BUT THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY
DOING MUCH.
MARK: PAUL KRUGMAN SAYS MONETARY
POLICY IS NOT DOING THAT MUCH.
YOU HAD WILLIAM DOUBT A FEW DAYS
AGO TALKING ABOUT REVISITING THE
FRAMEWORK.
THAT MAY BE THE THEME OF JACKSON
HOLE, REVISITING THE FRAMEWORK.
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE QUESTIONING
WHETHER THEIR APPROACH HAS BEEN
EFFECTIVE, HOW SOON MIGHT WE SEE
THIS TRICKLE THROUGH?
>> THE TRICKLING THROUGH HAS TO
BE THROUGH THE POLITICAL CLASS.
IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A FISCAL
POLICY THAT IS COHERENT AND TRY
TO CALL CLEMENT WHAT MONETARY
POLICY HAS DONE -- COMPLEMENT
WHAT MONETARY POLICY HAS DONE,
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THE
POLITICIANS EMBRACE.
DEPENDING ON WHO IS ELECTED IN
NOVEMBER AND WHO ENDS UP WINNING
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THERE
IS POTENTIAL FOR THERE TO BE
SOME CHANGES IN FISCAL POLICY.
BOTH PARTIES ARE TALKING ABOUT
SPENDING MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE.
WE REALLY DO NEED SOME CHANGES
IN FISCAL POLICY.
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE TRYING TO SEE
EXACTLY WHEN THAT CAN HAPPEN AND
WHAT ACTUALLY WOULD HAPPEN.
MARK: SURE.
MUCH APPRECIATED.
GREAT CONVERSATION.
SCARLET: COMING UP, IS THIS
STILL A HEATED BULL RALLY?
WE SHOW HOW THE STOCK MARKET IS
LURING MORE INVESTORS.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
MARK: IMR CRUMPTON.
LET'S GET TO FIRST WORD NEWS.
HILLARY -- I AM MARK CRUMPTON.
LET'S GET TO FIRST WORD NEWS.
HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT POLICE
AND COMMUNITIES MUST WORK
TOGETHER TO REPAIR THE BONDS OF
TRUST.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS SET TO BECOME
THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO
VISIT LAOS.
HE WILL VISIT LAOS AND CHINA
NEXT MONTH.
HE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A SUMMIT
WITH LEADERS FROM THE WORLD'S
TOP 20 INDUSTRIALIZED AND
DEVELOPING NATIONS.
HE WILL MEET WITH THE CHINESE
PRESIDENT.
IN LAOS, HE WILL ATTEND A PAIR
OF REGIONAL CONFERENCES.
IN TURKEY, REBELS ARE BEING
BLAMED FOR A STRING OF BOMBINGS
TARGETING SECURITY FORCES.
AT LEAST 14 PEOPLE ARE DEAD,
MORE THAN 220 OTHERS WOUNDED.
TWO OF THE ATTACKS WERE CAR
BOMBS.
A THIRD ATTACK TARGETED A
MILITARY VEHICLE IN THE
SOUTHEAST.
IT IS THE SALE OF A LIFETIME IF
YOU ARE A STUDENT OF WORLD WAR
II.
A TANK MUSEUM IN FRANCE IS
SELLING ITS ENTIRE COLLECTION,
SOME OF WHICH WAS USED ON V-DAY.
MORE THAN 40 AUTOMOBILES WILL BE
UP FOR SALE.
THE MUSEUM OPENED IN 2013.
IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRAW
ENOUGH THE VISITORS TO STAY
OPEN.
GLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY
POWERED BY MORE THAN 2600
JOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS IN MORE
THAN 120 COUNTRIES.
I AM MARK CRUMPTON.
BACK TO YOU.
JOE: THANK YOU.
IT HAS BEEN CALLED A HEATED BULL
MARKET.
BUT NOW WITH LOW VOLATILITY
STOCKS FALLING TO THE BACK OF
THE PACKET AS TECHNOLOGY
COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIAL SHARES
BEAT THE S&P 500'S ALL TIME
HIGHS, INVESTORS MIGHT BE
FINALLY GETTING IN.
WE WANT TO START WITH SOMETHING
TANGIBLE, WHERE PEOPLE ARE
PUTTING THEIR MONEY.
THIS HAS TO BE A HUGE CHART FOR
ALL THE VIEWERS THAT E-MAIL ME
OVER THE PAST YEAR AND SAID WHAT
IS GOING SHORT INTEREST THAT WE
CAN COVER CLOSELY?
GUESS WHAT, IT IS FINALLY GOING
DOWN.
SHORTS WERE CLOSEST TO THEIR
HIGHS SINCE THE FINANCIAL
CRISIS.
AT THE SAME TIME, INVESTORS HAVE
GONE LONG.
NOT ONLY HAVE THEY LOWERED THE
SHORTS, BUT THIS IS A CHART
SHOWING FUTURES CONTRACTS, ABOUT
23% MORE LONG THAN SHORT.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN QUITE
SOME TIME.
EXACTLY WHERE OUR INVESTORS
PUTTING THEIR MONEY BY ASSET
CLASS?
BANK OF AMERICA HAD A REPORT
THAT THE U.S. WAS SELLING
TREASURIES AT A PACE THEY HADN'T
IN QUITE SOME TIME.
INVESTORS CONSIDERING HIGH-YIELD
BONDS VERSUS STOCKS, WHAT YOU
ARE LOOKING AT IS SHARES
OUTSTANDING VERSUS HIGH-YIELD
BOND ETF'S.
HIGH-YIELD BOND FLOWS AND SHARES
OUTSTANDING HAVE GONE A LITTLE
BIT LOWER.
IF YOU LOOK DOWN HERE AT THE
SPREAD BETWEEN THE TWO, THEY
HAVE MOVED QUITE A BIT IN FAVOR
OF STOCKS.
WE KNOW THE BOND MARKET HAS BEEN
PART OF THIS VOLATILE MARKET.
FINALLY, VOLATILITY.
IT IS EXTREMELY LOW RIGHT NOW.
WE BASICALLY HAVE 30 DAYS WITH
THE VIX TRADING BELOW 15, WHICH
IS NOT A LEVEL IT IS TYPICALLY
AT.
IT IS BASICALLY THE LONGEST WE
HAVE HAD THAT DROUGHT IN ABOUT A
YEAR.
INVESTORS ARE BETTING IT IS
GOING TO GO LOWER.
THAT GREEN SHADED AREA SHOWS YOU
THOSE BARS AND THAT INVESTORS
ARE BETTING IT'S GOING TO GO
EVEN LOWER.
SOME OF THE DATA, INCLUDING
SHORT INTEREST, MIGHT EVEN COME
OUT AS WE ARE SPEAKING AND WE
WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES.
AT THE SAME TIME, INVESTOR
HESITATION HASN'T DISAPPEARED
ENTIRELY.
RETAIL INVESTORS REMAIN PRETTY
BEARISH.
OVERALL, THERE IS AN ARGUMENT
THAT BULLISHNESS IN THE MARKET
HAS NOT BEEN THERE.
BUT SOME BIG PLAYERS ARE NOW
FINDING STOCKS.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
SCARLET: SHARES OF WALMART ARE
CLIMBING AFTER THE RETAILER
POSTED SECOND-QUARTER PROFITS
THAT BEAT ESTIMATES.
MEANWHILE, TARGET CUT
EXPECTATIONS, CITING A DIFFICULT
RETAIL ENVIRONMENT.
CONTRADICTORY RETAIL
EXPLANATIONS, WHICH MIGHT
SUGGEST THAT TARGET JUST HASN'T
FIGURED IT OUT.
>> I WAS TRYING TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF WHERE THE CONSUMER IS
AT.
TARGET PAINTED A GRIM PICTURE OF
WALMART.
SAYING THINGS ARE STABLE, NOT
GREAT.
BUT THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THE
MARKET CHANGE THIS YEAR FROM
WHERE THEY WERE A YEAR AGO.
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MAY BE A
DIFFERENCE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT
TARGET VERSUS WALMART.
SCARLET: THIS WAS MY DEEP DIVE
EARLIER SHOWING HOW WALMART PE A
VALUATION CREATED A PREMIUM TO
TARGETS VALUATION.
IT'S AT ITS HIGHEST FROM ABOUT
FOUR YEARS AGO.
JOE: WHAT HAS CHANGED?
OBVIOUSLY, THE NUMBERS TODAY
WERE DECENT, BUT HELL OF
INVESTORS RETHOUGHT THIS
COMPANY?
-- HOW HAVE INVESTORS RETHOUGHT
THIS COMPANY?
>> THE REST OF THE MARKET WAS
TANKING.
I THINK IT PICKED UP A LITTLE
BIT OF WIND FROM INVESTORS WHO
WERE LOOKING FOR A SAFE HAVEN.
THEY WERE REMINDED THAT WALMART
WAS THE PLACE TO GO.
THEN WE HAD RELATIVELY GOOD
NUMBERS.
WE SAW TARGET AND OTHER
RETAILERS NOT DOING SO WELL.
IF YOU WANT TO BE IN THE RETAIL
SPACE, WHERE DO YOU LOOK?
WALMART.
I THINK INVESTORS ARE GETTING A
LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT CHANGES
WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST YEAR
OR SO ARE STARTING TO TAKE
EFFECT.
MARK: CONFIDENCE LET'S TALK ABOR
EARNINGS HERE SINCE IT IS
EARNINGS SEASON.
TARGET IS IN FOCUS TODAY,
PLAYING A LITTLE BIT OF
CATCH-UP.
OBVIOUSLY, THE TREND IN THE PAST
HAS BEEN DOWNWARD.
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?
>> WE WILL SEE IF THIS TREND
HOLDS.
A BIG DRIVER OF THAT HAS BEEN
THE PRODUCTS THEY ARE SELLING
ONLINE.
ITS BASIC MATH.
IF YOU HAVE MORE PRODUCT, YOU
CAN HAVE MORE SALES.
THEY HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED THE
NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THEY SELL
ONLINE TO THIRD-PARTY
MARKETPLACE SELLERS.
THAT HAS HELPED DRIVE A LOT OF
TRAFFIC TO THE SITE.
IT HAS BEEN A BIG FOCUS.
THEY HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF
CRITICISM FOR SALES DECLINING.
I THINK WE ARE SEEING SOME
INVESTMENT IN TURNING THINGS
AROUND START TO TAKE HOLD.
AND WE WILL SEE MORE BY THE END
OF THE YEAR WHEN THE ACQUISITION
OF JET.COM IS COMPLETE.
SO NEXT YEAR WILL BE A WHOLE NEW
YEAR OF ONLINE SALES.
SCARLET: AND AN OUT-OF-CONTROL
CRIME PROBLEM IS DRIVING LOCAL
POLICE CRAZY.
EXPLAIN THAT.
>> FOR YEARS NOW, WALMART HAS
REALLY BEEN THE MAJOR SOURCE OF
CRIME IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES.
I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT SMALL
TOWNS.
I TALKING ABOUT PLACES LIKE IN
DENVER, TULSA, AUSTIN.
PEOPLE -- POLICE ARE CALLED TO
THE STORE MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY,
SOMETIMES THOUSANDS OF TIMES A
YEAR, FOR EVERYTHING FROM
SHOPLIFTING A TOY OR VIDEOGAME
TO VERY SERIOUS, VIOLENT CRIMES,
SHOOTINGS IN THE PARKING LOT.
THERE WAS AN EMPLOYEE KILLED
EARLIER THIS YEAR BY A
SHOPLIFTER.
SUMMARY PULLED A KNIFE ON AN
EMPLOYEE.
-- SOMEBODY PULLED A KNIFE ON AN
EMPLOYEE.
THERE IS STILL AN ISSUE OF
SHOPLIFTING AND THEFT GOING ON
THAT COSTS THE COMPANY EVERY
YEAR.
MARK: OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES
UPSET THAT TAXPAYERS ARE ON THE
HOOK FOR THE POLICING -- ARE THE
LOCAL COMMUNITIES UPSET THE
TAXPAYERS ARE ON THE HOOK FOR
THE POLICING IN RESPONSE TO ALL
OF THIS CRIME?
>> THEY ARE.
I SPOKE TODAY TO A COMMUNITY
PLANNING BOARD IN KANSAS THAT
WAS RAISING THIS EXACT ISSUE.
WE DON'T WANT WALMART COMING TO
TOWN BECAUSE IT IS A DRAIN ON
THE POLICE FORCE.
IT'S ONE MORE PROBLEM WALMART
HASN'T GOTTEN AROUND.
THEY ARE TRYING.
THEY ARE MAKING EFFORTS.
BUT IT IS AN UNDERLYING FACTOR.
>> IT'S A GREAT STORY AND
EVERYBODY SHOULD FIND IT AND
READ IT.
SCARLET: COMING UP, BUILDING A
NEW FRAMEWORK FOR GLOBALIZATION.
WE TO ONE OF THE MOST
INFLUENTIAL LEADERS IN WORLD
ECONOMICS.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
MARK: HOMELAND SECURITY
SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON IS IN
LOUISIANA FOR A FIRSTHAND LOOK
AT THE SEVERE FLOODING THAT HAS
IMPACTED THE SOUTHERN REGION OF
THE STATE AND THE ONGOING
RESPONSE AND RECOVERY.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS
ISSUED A DISASTER DECLARATION
FOR 20 PARISHES.
MORE THAN 70,000 PEOPLE HAVE
ALREADY REGISTERED FOR
INDIVIDUAL FEMA ASSISTANCE AND
MORE THAN 90,000 FLOOD INSURANCE
CLAIMS HAVE BEEN FILED.
LAW ENFORCED AND OFFICIALS IN
BRAZIL -- ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS
IN BRAZIL ARE ACCUSING FOUR U.S.
SWIMMERS OF LYING ABOUT BEING
HELD AT GUNPOINT.
THE ATHLETES, INCLUDING RYAN
LOCHTE, WERE CONFRONTED BY
SECURITY GUARDS CARRYING GUNS
AFTER LEAVING A PARTY IN A RIO
SUBURB.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED
THAT GUARDS POINTED GUNS AT
LOCKE D AND THREE OTHERS DURING
A DISPUTE AT A GAS STATION.
THE U.S. HAS WITHHELD A CASH
PAYMENT TO IRAN AS LEVERAGE.
THE U.S. WANTED TO ENSURE THAT
LISTENERS WERE RELEASED AS --
PRISONERS WERE RELEASED AS
PROMISED.
AN EGYPTIAN MILITARY COURT HAS
SENTENCED 418 ALLEGED SUPPORTERS
OF THE BANNED MUSLIM

MOST WERE SENTENCED IN ABSENTIA
FOR TWO YEARS TO LIFE FOR THEIR
INVOLVEMENT IN THE STORMING OF A
POLICE STATION IN AUGUST, 2013.
THE VIOLENCE LEFT HUNDREDS DEAD.
GLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY
POWERED BY MORE THAN 2600
JOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS IN MORE
THAN 120 COUNTRIES.
SCARLET: WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS.
EMERSON IS BUYING A VALVE
BUSINESS FOR $3.1 BILLION.
THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF U.S.
STOCKS INCHING HIGHER TO CLOSE
WITH GAINS.
THE S&P GAINING ALMOST FIVE
POINTS, DOW INDUSTRIALS ADDING
24.
REALLY, AS YOU SAID, THIS IS A
CONTINUATION OF THE REACTION TO
THE FED'S DOVISH MINUTES.
>> WE SAW MARKETS PICK UP.
WE SAW YIELDS DROP.
WE SAW YIELDS ON GOVERNMENT
BONDS CONTINUE TO SLIP AGAIN
TODAY.
>> LESS THAN 6 BILLION SHARES
TRADED.
JOE: WHAT DID YOU MISS?
A NEW KIND OF GLOBALIZATION.
CAPITAL FLOWS AND TRADE HAVE
BEEN A HOT TOPIC FOR DECADES,
BUT THIS YEAR THE ISSUES ARE
BACK ON THE FOREFRONT,
PARTICULARLY ON THE U.S.
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
JOINING US NOW IS A PROFESSOR OF
ECONOMICS AND THE LEADER IN
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
OBVIOUSLY, TRADING GLOBALIZATION
ARE HUGE TOPICS IN THE ELECTION
AND HUGE IN EUROPE AS WELL.
WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET PEOPLE
EXCITED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE
IDEA OF GLOBAL TRADE?
>> THE IDEA IS THAT YOU EXPAND
THE PIE, BUT THE PIE IS ALL
GOING TO THE GROUP AT THE TOP
END SO -- ANSWER THOSE LEFT --
AND SO THOSE LEFT BEHIND ARE NOT
TOO EXCITED ABOUT TRADE.
INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES
HAS BEEN WIDENING PRETTY
RELENTLESSLY FOR THE LAST 30-40
YEARS.
THE PUBLIC IS NOT BACKING TRADE.
WE ALSO HAVE THE POINT THAT
HILLARY AND TRUMP ARE BOTH
AGAINST THE TPP BUT THE
PRESIDENT IS STILL PUSHING IT TO
A LAME DUCK CONGRESS.
THERE IS A LOT OF MANEUVERING
BEHIND THE SCENES TO PUSH THIS
THROUGH EVEN THOUGH THE PUBLIC
IS NOT TOO HAPPY WITH IT.
SCARLET: WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR
WITH HOW GLOBALIZATION HAS
CREATED A LOT OF LOSERS IN THE
DEVELOP WORLD, IN THE U K, IN
THE U.S. 
WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF
GLOBALIZATION FOR EMERGING
ECONOMIES?
IT IS EASY TO THINK THAT CHINA
AND MEXICO WIN, BUT THERE ARE
LOSERS IN THOSE ECONOMIES AS
WELL, AREN'T THERE?
>> IN GENERAL, MARKETS CREATE
INEQUALITY, AND USUALLY, YOU
NEED GOVERNMENT POLICY TO CLOSE
THE GAPS TO REDUCE IT.
IN CHINA, WHICH IS THE MOST
SPECTACULAR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
IN HISTORY, INEQUALITY HAS ALSO
SOARED.
HERE, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE
TRADE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED
STATES, AND WE POINT TO CHINA
SAYING THAT TOOK AWAY A LOT OF
MANUFACTURING JOBS.
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THERE IS A LOT OF UNREST AND A
LOT OF CONCERN IN CHINA, HOW DO
WE MANAGE THIS AS WELL?
MARK: I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE
POINT THAT THERE IS
GLOBALIZATION THAT IS A SLICE OF
THE PIE GOING TO A CERTAIN GROUP
OF PEOPLE.
HAS THAT SLICE GOTTEN LARGER OR
IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PERSON
GETTING LEFT BEHIND AND THOSE
ARE THE PEOPLE REACTING NOW?
>> THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS GROWN.
ON THE WHOLE, BESIDES 2008,
FALLING OUT OF BED, THE ECONOMY
HAS GROWN PRETTY WELL OVER THE
COURSE OF THE LAST GENERATION,
EVEN LONGER.
BUT THE INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED
STATES, ESPECIALLY AT THE VERY
TOP, THE FAMOUS 1%, ARE NOW AT
AND IN CASH AT AN IMPRESSIVELY
HIGH SHARE.
-- ARE NOW ADDED IMPRESSIVELY
HIGH SHARE.
SO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE DONALD
TRUMP IS APPEALING TO AN
CONTESTED RUST BELT STATES THAT
LOST THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR,
THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE LOSSES
OCCURRED, THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
NOW, THE RESEARCH SHOWS MORE AND
MORE THAT COMPETITION WITH CHINA
REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE.
MY VIEW IS THAT TRADE ON THE
WHOLE CAN BE GOOD, BUT IF WE ARE
IN A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT SAYS
TOUGH LUCK TO YOU, YOU ARE BEING
LEFT BEHIND, DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE
TO BE OVERJOYED ABOUT TRADE.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT HAS BEEN THE
ATTITUDE FOR SEVERAL
GENERATIONS.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE
SAID TRADE IS GOOD.
NOW NAFTA, NOW THIS, NOW TPP,
AND IF YOU ARE A LOSER, TOUGH.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO SELL
ANYMORE.
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO PUSH IT
THROUGH IN THE LAME-DUCK
SESSION.
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE
DISGRACEFUL TO TAKE SOMETHING SO
IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THAT BOTH CANDIDATES ARE
AGAINST, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS
ABSOLUTELY GOING TO TRY EVERY
MANEUVER TO GET IT THROUGH IN,
WHAT I THINK IT IS NOT A VERY
DEMOCRATIC WAY, AFTER THE
ELECTION.
JOE: YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE
DISTRIBUTION RIGHT, THAT YOU
CAN'T HAVE ALL THE GAINS GOING
TO THE TOP.
ONE FACTOR OF THAT IS THAT
CAPITALIZATION CAN LEAVE THE
COUNTRY.
THERE ARE PEOPLE MOVING MONEY
OUT.
THERE ARE TECHNICAL
ASPECTS TO DISTRIBUTION.
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
DOMESTICALLY TO ADDRESS THE
RAMIFICATIONS OF GLOBALIZATION
BECAUSE JUST MOVING MONEY AROUND
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WILL SOLVE
THE ISSUE.
>> FIRST, CAPITAL IS A MOBILE
FACTOR AND CAPITAL HAS BEEN THE
BIG WINNER.
WHEN YOU HAVE INTERNATIONAL
CAPITAL -- WHICH IS THE NEW
WORLD ECONOMY IN THE MOST RECENT
YEARS -- THEN THERE IS ALSO A
TENDENCY OF A RACE TO THE
BOTTOM.
WE HAVE TO CUT TAXES BECAUSE
THEY ARE CUTTING TAXES.
UNLESS THERE IS GLOBAL
COOPERATION, YOU END UP WITH THE
PANAMA PAPERS, TAX HAVENS, SOME
BIG COMPANIES BASICALLY NOT
PAYING TAXES BECAUSE THERE ARE
SO MANY GIMMICKS IN THE TAX CODE
THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE
CAYMANS OR BERMUDA EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS MADE IN OUR UNIVERSITIES.
BUT THEY DON'T PUT TAXES ON --
PAY TAXES ON THAT ANYMORE.
YOU NEED GLOBAL COOPERATION.
IT'S ALSO TRUE -- BY THE WAY,
INCOME DISTRIBUTION HELPS.
IF YOU ARE IN A STRUGGLING
FAMILY, YOU DON'T MIND HAVING
EASIER TAXES ARE A HIGHER EARNED
INCOME TAX CREDIT, OR WHATEVER
IT IS, BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT
WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THIS YEAR,
WHICH IS THAT ONE WAY OUT OF
THIS IS HIGHER SKILLS AND MORE
DEGREES.
GOING FOR A MASTER'S OR
BACHELOR.
POOR KIDS CAN'T DO THAT.
WE HAVE A TRILLION DOLLARS OF
DEBT.
THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HANDLED
THIS BEST ARE THE NORTHERN
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
THEY HAVE FREE TUITION.
THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE BERNIE HAD
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
THAT REQUIRES REVENUE TO PAY FOR
IT.
THAT REQUIRES TAXATION.
WE ARE BACK TO THE SAME INCOME
DISTRIBUTION POINT I AM MAKING
WHICH IS, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE
TRADE, WHICH I DO, YOU NEED
REDISTRIBUTION, BUT IF YOU HAVE
REDISTRIBUTION, YOU NEED TO DO
IT IN A SMART WAY, YOU NEED
COOPERATION, AND YOU NEED TO
HAVE SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND SO
ON.
BUT THAT REQUIRES SOMEBODY
PAYING THEIR TAXES.
SCARLET: AND IT HAS TO BE
SUSTAINABLE.
FREE TUITION IN EUROPE, THERE'S
AN UNDERCLASS OF DOCTORAL
STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE JOBS.
>> TO HAVE AN AVERAGE INCOME I
WE DO, $50,000, $55,000 PER
PERSON, THAT IS A SOPHISTICATED
ECONOMY.
YOU NEED SOPHISTICATED POLICIES
AS WELL.
THE REALLY GOOD PERFORMING
ECONOMIES INVEST IN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY.
WHERE DID THEY GET THE MONEY?
YOU NEED REVENUE TO BE ABLE TO
DO THAT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AHEAD AND
SAY WE ARE GOING TO BUILD SKILLS
AND JOBS IN A BALANCED WAY.
WE GAVE UP ON THAT INSTEAD LET
THE TOP  FOR IT.
IT WILL TRICKLE DOWN.
WE -- AND SAID LET THE TOP GO
FOR IT.
IT WILL TRICKLE DOWN.
WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR 40
YEARS NOW.
MARK: REALLY POOR AND
CONVERSATION.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
SCARLET: COMING UP, DONALD TRUMP
MAKING A BIG COMEBACK.
WE WILL DISCUSS HIS REVISED
PLAYBOOK.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

SCARLET: APPLE HAS HIT A MAJOR
SNAG CONNECTING ITS WATCH TO
CELLULAR NETWORKS TO MAKE IT
LESS DEPENDENT ON THE IPHONE.
THAT IS ACCORDING TO PEOPLE WITH
KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATTER.

LAUNCH THE WATCH THIS FALL.
THE UPDATED VERSION WILL BE ABLE
TO INTEGRATE LOCATION TRACKING.
HARLEY DAVIDSON HAS AGREED TO

THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG
BUSINESS FLASH.
JOE: WHAT DID YOU MISS?
THE NEW PLAN TO FREE DONALD
TRUMP AND SAVE HIS CAMPAIGN.
HE HAS HIRED A MAN WHO HAS BEEN
DESCRIBED AS THE MOST DANGEROUS
POLITICAL OPERATIVE IN AMERICA.
WE ARE JOINED BY ALEX WAYNE IN
WASHINGTON.
FREEING TRUMP.
EVERYONE IS SORT OF LAUGHING AT
THIS IDEA THAT FINALLY TRUMP IS
GOING TO BE UNSHACKLED AND SAY
WHAT HE REALLY THINKS.
HAS HE NOT BEEN TELLING US WHAT
HE BELIEVES SO FAR?
>> I GUESS WE ARE GOING TO GET
EVEN MORE TRUMP.
JOSH GREEN'S EXCELLENT REPORTING
ON BANNON HAS INDICATED THAT
TRUMP WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE
EFFORT TO "CONSTRAIN" HIM.
I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF THAT,
BUT APPARENTLY, PEOPLE WERE
TRYING TO TONE HIM DOWN.
HE HAS ALSO BEEN VERY ANGRY
ABOUT HIS POLLING, WHICH OF
COURSE, IS SINKING.
MARK: A QUESTION ABOUT THIS
TITLE, THE MOST DANGEROUS
POLITICAL OPERATIVES IN AMERICA.
WHO IS THIS GUY?
>> THERE IS A WEBSITE CALLED
BREITBART NEWS.
IT IS A CONSERVATIVE WEBSITE.
I HESITATE TO CALL IT NEWS, BUT
THAT IS WHAT THEY CALL
THEMSELVES.
THEIR STORIES ARE ALMOST WITHOUT
EXCEPTION INFLAMMATORY.
THEY HAVE LONG BEEN A CHAMPION
OF DONALD TRUMP.
THEY HAVE WRITING -- HAVE BEEN
WRITING ABOUT HIM SINCE HE FIRST
CAME OUT AS A CANDIDATE.
JOE: IS LOOKING AT THE
ACQUISITION OF BANNON AND SAYING
OH BOY, THIS WILL REALLY MEAN
SOMETHING TO TRUMP.
>> I DON'T THINK THE HILLARY
CAMPAIGN IS TOO WORRIED ABOUT
THIS GUY JOINING THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN.
IF TRUMP WERE LOOKING FOR A GUY
WHO WOULD HELP THEM APPEAL TO
BLACKS, HISPANICS, OR ANYONE
SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON IN
GREAT NUMBERS, BANNON IS NOT THE
GUY.
HIS WEBSITE DOES NOT APPEAL TO
THAT AUDIENCE.
SCARLET: WHAT IS HILLARY
CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN RESPONSE TO
ALL OF THESE CHANGES IN THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN?
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE SITTING
BACK AND LETTING THE HEADLINES
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, BUT IS
THERE A WAY TO BE OPPORTUNISTIC
AND REDIRECT?
>> I HEARD A SAYING THIS MORNING
THAT WHEN YOUR OPPONENT IS
COMMITTING SUICIDE, THERE IS NO
REASON TO COMMIT HOMICIDE.
THEY ARE EXPECTING MORE VIGOROUS
ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
AND THEY SAY THEY ARE PREPARED
TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
THEY HAVE AN ARRAY OF CLINTON
ALLIES ON THE LEFT WHO THINK
THEY CAN GO TOE TO TOE WITH
BANNON AND TRUMP.
JOE: GOING BACK TO
BREITBART.COM, EVEN MORE THAN
BEING CONSERVATIVE, IT HAS A
NATIONALIST, POPULIST BENT TO
IT.
IS THIS AN INDICATION OF WHAT
TRUMP IS ABOUT?
IS HE A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT
STRAIN OF RIGHT-WING
IDEOLOGY?
>> JOSH GREEN IN HIS STORY
DESCRIBED BREITBART AS EMBRACING
THE PARANOID WING OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
THERE IS A WING KNOWN AS ALT
RIGHT.
THEY HAVE DONE WELL AT TOWING
THE LINE BETWEEN EMBRACING THE
REDDIT WEIGHING AND -- WING AND
STAYING ON THE EDGE OF
MAINSTREAM CONSERVATISM.
JOE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SCARLET: COMING UP, THE BATTLE
FOR WIRELESS SUBSCRIBERS ENTERS
A NEW PHASE.
WE WILL BE HEARING FROM
T-MOBILE.
â™ª
SCARLET: T-MOBILE IS MOVING ONCE
AGAIN TO SHAKE UP THE WIRELESS
INDUSTRY, THE CARRIER ANNOUNCING
TODAY IT IS SWITCHING TO AN
UNLIMITED ONLY PLAN FOR
CUSTOMERS.
BETTY LIU SPOKE WITH THE
T-MOBILE CEO AND JOINS US WITH
THE HIGHLIGHTS.
BETTY: HE IS BASICALLY GETTING
RID OF ALL OF THESE FEES AND
OVERAGE CHARGES AND JUST GIVING
YOU AN UNLIMITED PLAN.
IT ALMOST SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE
TRUE, AND IT JUST MIGHT BE.
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS.
BASICALLY, HE IS SAYING THAT A
FAMILY OF FOUR CAN PAY $150 A
MONTH AND GET UNLIMITED VOICE,
DATA, TEXT, AND RIGHT AWAY,
SPRINT CAME OUT AND SAID THEY
WERE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING
FOR $160.
SO, THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS.
DO YOU GET THE SAME QUALITY WITH
THAT PRICE POINT?
AND THE ANSWER IS NO.
SO, IF YOU WANT THE SAME
QUALITY, THERE ARE EXTRA FEES
ADDED ON.
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO DOESN'T
HAVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THEIR
CARRIER, I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS.
THE TEASE COMING UP -- TWEETS
COMING OUT ON T-MOBILE, AT&T,
VERIZON, THE PROOF IS IN THE
PUDDING.
THEY WANT TO SEE HOW THIS IS
GOING TO WORK.
MARK: VERIZON IS CONSPICUOUSLY
ABSENT.
ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE
PART IN A BIDDING MORE?
BETTY: ABSOLUTELY NOT.
JOHN IS RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT
HE HAS BEEN GAINING SUBSCRIBERS
WHILE OTHERS, LIKE VERIZON,
AT&T, AND SPRINT, HAVE BEEN
LOSING.
THERE IS NO SITTING BACK AT ALL
FOR ANY OF THESE CARRIERS,
ESPECIALLY VERIZON, BUT WHEN I
TALK TO HIM ABOUT SPRINT, HE
SAID FORGET SPRINT, I AM TALKING
ABOUT VERIZON.
HE IS REALLY GOING AFTER MARKET
SHARE.
ALL OF THIS MAKES JOHN AND HIS
PINK T-SHIRT PRETTY ATTRACTIVE,
RIGHT?
SOFTBANK HAS COME OUT -- THERE
WAS AN ARTICLE ON BLOOMBERG
WHERE HE SAID HE STILL HOPES
THERE IS A MERGER POSSIBILITY
WITH T-MOBILE.
HERE IS WHAT JOHN SAID TO THAT.
JOHN: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
LOOKING TO WHAT THEY COULD
POSSIBLY DO WITH T-MOBILE, AND I
WOULD JUST TELL THEM, IT'S SORT
OF LIKE THE DMV.
TAKE A TICKET AND STANDARD WERE
THERE, AND WE WILL GET TO YOU.
I'M NOT SURPRISED YOU LIKE US.
I LIKE US AS WELL.
BETTY: PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE
WITH THEIR CARRIERS WANTED TO BE
JUST LIKE BEING ONLINE WITH THE
DMV.
THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL
THERE IS A NEW ADMINISTRATION IN
THE WHITE HOUSE, BECAUSE RIGHT
NOW, WITH TOM WHEELER AT THE
FCC, THERE IS NO CHANCE AT ALL
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
COMBINING A THIRD AND FOURTH
CARRIER, COULD EVER PASS
REGULATORS.
JOE: YOU MENTIONED THAT THE
QUALITY WOULD NOT BE AS GOOD.
HOW MUCH WORSE ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT?
BETTY: IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH
YOU ARE WILLING TO TOLERATE AND
PAY.
IF YOU WANT HD QUALITY ON VIDEO,
YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY $25 EXTRA
TO GET THAT.
JOE: THANKS, BETTY.
YOU CAN CATCH BETTY ON BLOOMBERG
DAYBREAK ASIA.
SCARLET: COMING UP, WHAT YOU
NEED TO KNOW BEFORE TOMORROW'S
TRADING DAY.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
â™ª
SCARLET: TWO AND A HALF HOURS
LATER, TIME WIN RELEASES --
TAIWAN RELEASES ITS GDP.
JOE: DON'T MISS THIS.
AT 7:00 A.M. TOMORROW, WE GET
THE LATEST EARNINGS FROM GEAR,
-- FROM JOHN DEERE, A COMPANY
INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURAL
MACHINERY.
SCARLET: THAT IS ALL FOR US.
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
MARK: WE WILL SEE YOU BACK HERE
TOMORROW.
JOE: HAVE A GREAT EVENING.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
