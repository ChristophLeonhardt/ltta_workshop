1
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:11,360
>>MEET THE REAL CULTIST.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,096
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:14,396
ANGLE.

4
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:17,366
YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO THE

5
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:17,999
ANTI-TRUMP RESISTANCE.

6
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,868
THEY'VE TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT

7
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:20,969
THINGS TO STOP DONALD TRUMP.

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,406
WELL, DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THE

9
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:26,308
CHATTER AND CLASSES AT VARIOUS

10
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:28,543
TIMES CALLED HIM A RACIST, HE

11
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:31,146
WAS A MISOGYNIST, HE WAS STUPID,

12
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:33,048
A FRAUD IN BUSINESS, HE WASN'T

13
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:35,817
AS WELL READ AS THE OTHER

14
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:36,218
CANDIDATES.

15
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:40,155
HE ALSO DIDN'T PLAY NICE IN THE

16
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:40,489
SANDBOX.

17
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:47,496
HE WAS BRASH, BOORISH, AND AN

18
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:47,646
EGO

19
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:48,029
EG

20
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:48,630
EGOMANIAC.

21
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,732
AND NOW AFTER THIS IG REPORT, WE

22
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:52,067
KNOW THAT THEY WERE AGENTS BY

23
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:54,269
DAY AND ACTIVISTS BY NIGHT, WHO

24
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:56,371
WERE WORKING ON AN INSURANCE

25
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:57,406
POLICY TO STOP TRUMP FROM

26
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,373
WINNING THE PRESIDENCY.

27
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:02,911
AND THEN WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK,

28
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,346
FIRED FBI DIRECTOR JIM COMEY

29
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,582
LEAKED HIS NOTES TO A PAL WHO IN

30
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:10,051
TURN LEAKED THEM TO THE PRESS,

31
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,887
ALL TO TRIGGER THE APPOINTMENT

32
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:13,188
OF SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT

33
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:16,491
MUELLER ON THAT BOGUS RUSSIA

34
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:17,626
COLLUSION THEORY.

35
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:20,695
AND NOW MORE THAN A YEAR AND $17

36
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:23,532
MILLION LATER, WHILE THE SPECIAL

37
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:25,967
COUNSEL'S APPROVAL NUMBERS HAVE

38
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:27,569
GONE DOWN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

39
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:33,842
HAVE GONE UP, THE ECONOMY IS

40
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:34,176
SOARING.

41
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,845
AND OF COURSE TRUMP IS ENFORCING

42
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:39,214
OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS AFTER YEARS

43
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:42,317
OF NEGLECT.

44
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:48,557
WAGES HAVE GONE UP, UNEMPLOYMENT

45
00:01:48,557 --> 00:01:49,524
HAS GONE DOWN.

46
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:51,326
SO NOW THE TRUMP RESISTANCE HAVE

47
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:52,727
GOT TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.

48
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,763
>>  IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR

49
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:59,401
ANY PARTY TO END UP WITH A

50
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,469
CULT-LIKE SITUATION AS IT

51
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,471
RELATES TO A PRESIDENT.

52
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:05,006
>>  HE'S DEVOLVED INTO A CULT.

53
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:07,242
>>  YOU CAN HAVE THE LAST WORD.

54
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:09,144
>>  DONALD TRUMP IS ACCUSED OF

55
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:09,845
LEADING A CULT.

56
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,546
SO CULT IS FAIR TO YOU?

57
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:12,514
>>  I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

58
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:14,082
IS HEADED THAT WAY.

59
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:16,151
I THINK CULT IS A VERY STRONG

60
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:19,421
BUT A VERY GOOD WORD IN THIS

61
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:19,721
CASE.

62
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:21,423
>>  OBAMA CALLED US BITTER

63
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:28,797
CRINGE  -- CLINGERS.

64
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:31,666
AN AGENT OF THE FBI USE LESS

65
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,601
AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE.

66
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,269
THIS IS HOW AN AGENT DESCRIBED

67
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,872
TRUMP VOTERS THE DAY AFTER THE

68
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:37,506
2016 ELECTION.

69
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:41,042
TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE ALL POOR TO

70
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:44,479
MIDDLE CLASS UNEDUCATED POS THAT

71
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,648
THINK HE WILL MAGICALLY GRANT

72
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:48,483
THEM JOBS FOR DOING NOTHING.

73
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:51,286
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T WATCH THE

74
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:54,089
DEBATES, AREN'T EDUCATED ON HIS

75
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,624
POLICIES AND ARE STUPIDLY

76
00:02:55,624 --> 00:03:00,262
WRAPPED UP IN HIS UNMERITED

77
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:00,795
ENTHUSIASM.

78
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:01,563
LOOK, DONALD TRUMP ISN'T

79
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:02,030
PERFECT.

80
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,532
NONE OF US ARE.

81
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:06,468
BUT MORE AMERICANS ARE SEEING

82
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,470
THAT HIS NEW APPROACHES TO

83
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,341
GOVERNANCE ARE PAYING OFF.

84
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,343
AND THEY'RE SEEING PAST THE

85
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,112
CONSTANT SNIPING AND CRITICISM

86
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:19,948
AND THEY'RE RECOGNIZING THAT

87
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,950
THROUGH IT ALL, TRUMP HAS

88
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,586
FOCUSED ON MAKING LIFE BETTER,

89
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:27,389
SAFER, MORE PROSPEROUS FOR THE

90
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,790
TRUE PEOPLE.

91
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,826
THAT'S NOT CULTISH.

92
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:32,761
IT'S COMMON SENSE.

93
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,429
THE CLOSEST THING WE'VE SEEN TO

94
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:37,098
A CULT IS THE CULT OF OBAMA.

95
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:38,867
WHO CAN FORGET THESE GEMS?

96
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:41,603
>>  YOU HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A

97
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:43,638
ROCKSTAR IN POLITICS.

98
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:45,574
>>  THE FEELING MOST PEOPLE GET

99
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:46,541
WHEN THEY HERE OBAMA.

100
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,642
>>  ALL THE HONORS THAT HAVE

101
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:50,045
COME YOUR WAY, ALL THE

102
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:52,147
PUBLICITY, WHO DOES IT MAKE YOU

103
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:52,681
THINK OF?

104
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:55,850
IS THERE A LOVED ONE?

105
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,252
>>  HE'S PERSONABLE.

106
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:58,887
HE'S HANDSOME.

107
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:02,023
>>  I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD

108
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:05,093
A PRESIDENT, SAVE LINCOLN, WHO

109
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:07,228
IS AS GREAT A SPEECH WRITER AT

110
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:08,129
THIS MAN.

111
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,431
>>  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FIRST

112
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,199
FAMILY IS HISTORIC.

113
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,934
>>  YOU'RE A BETTER MAN THAN ME,

114
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:13,201
SIR.

115
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,569
YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT US AND THE

116
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,270
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

117
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,771
>>  I COULD WATCH THAT ALL NIGHT

118
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:17,072
LONG.

119
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,773
WE HAD SO MANY CLIPS, BY THE

120
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:20,608
WAY, WE COULDN'T EVEN FIT THEM

121
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,110
IN THE ANGLE.

122
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,845
SO MAYBE WE'LL DO A SPECIAL SHOW

123
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:27,616
JUST TO REVIEW ALL THE FAWNING

124
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:30,852
OVER OBAMA.

125
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:37,292
THE  --

126
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,761
>>CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT

127
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,364
HAPPENED TO NAME MY GREATEST

128
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:42,731
STRENGTHS?

129
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:45,834
I GUESS IT WOULD BE MY HUMILITY.

130
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:46,601
GREATEST WEAKNESS.

131
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:50,071
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I'M A LITTLE

132
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,675
TOO AWESOME.

133
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:54,643
I...

134
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:56,011
[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]

135
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,413
SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

136
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,447
>>  AND ALTHOUGH OBAMA LEFT THE

137
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:02,651
WHITE HOUSE, HIS CULT MEMBERS

138
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:12,027
HAVEN'T LEFT THE  COMMUNE.

139
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:16,431
>>  YEP, FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA

140
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,966
IS WAITING.

141
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:22,671
>>  OBAMA'S SAYS DEMOCRATS

142
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,072
SHOULD TALKING ABOUT KITCHEN

143
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,374
TABLE ISSUES.

144
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:29,577
>>  AND HE WAS GRACIOUS AND HE'S

145
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:30,912
HELPING US RAISE SOME MONEY.

146
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:35,150
>>  DO THEY HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO

147
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,551
TURN TO?

148
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,452
NO ONE?

149
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:40,221
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT

150
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,724
TRUMP'S ECONOMIC NATIONALISM,

151
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:47,462
HIS CONSERVATIVE MORE POPULOUS

152
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,365
PHILOSOPHY WON'T OUTLAST HIS

153
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:50,965
PRESIDENCY.

154
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:54,369
IT CERTAINLY WILL.

155
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:56,604
UNACCOUNTABLE TRADE DEALS, LACKS

156
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:56,938
BORDERS.

157
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,808
THOSE DAYS, MY FRIENDS, ARE

158
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:00,108
OVER.

159
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:02,110
SO LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL,

160
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,513
UNTIL THE DEMOCRATS AND THE

161
00:06:05,513 --> 00:00:00,000
BITTER BUSHEES COME UP WITH SOME
