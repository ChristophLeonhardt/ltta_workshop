the former head of Moscow's anti-doping laboratory gaudiya chenkov a key witness in the russian doping scandal failed to confirm a number of allegations against the country's athletes during his recent testimony at the Court of Arbitration for sport well in February the court had upheld the appeals of 28 Russian athletes banned for doping and now is given some of its reasons so let's get some details now from You Got You Donna for joins us a in the studio Igor we were hearing the court gave details concerning the case didn't they so far of the Russian skier Alexander Lea Goff so what exactly was said and what is noteworthy about rodchenko's testimony well Andy in the two years that we have been through this whole saga it has almost become common knowledge that well Russia dopes every single Russian athletes they dope they take special drug cocktails like designer drugs the swab dirty samples for clean ones through some hole in the wall and so on and so forth now the foundation for all of these allegations was the testimony world more like tales of Grigory rotten cough he was the key witness for the whole case and for the for all of the he made all of the allegations but when he was questioned by the judges of the Court of Arbitration for sport which is the highest judicial body in the world of sport he actually admitted to and let me quickly read it out that he never administered these so-called cocktail himself he never saw this said cocktail being administered by somebody else he doesn't know he couldn't explain how the cocktail was smuggled abroad to be used at international championships and he's never been a witness to how clean urine samples was swapped for dirty ones and vice-versa now he did reveal that all of his that the allegation that he made in regarding to these points were basically him overhearing other colleagues or talking to other colleagues but not nothing of the sort was actually him seeing or doing things now the so basically his testimony showcased that the allegations are well circumstantial at best but well two years is a long time and in these two years his words were just taken at face value so to speak and he himself was propelled to fame he even starred in a oscar-winning documentary about doping in Russia I mean here have a taste I was hoping to facilitate but it was the most elaborate doping ploys in a sport history was Putin aware of the existence of a Russian doping system yes we are top level cheaters that part of the oscar-winning Icarus documentary about the whole saga um we should stage though shouldn't be ago that 11 Russian athletes continue to have their sanctions upheld by the CAS so there was doping going on but not the scale that everybody said it was going on by before and we also know that bra chenkov testimony was the foundation of richard mclaren support which was used to blanket ban a lot of russian athletes wasn't it so what did McClaren have to say himself well indeed McClaren also showed up in the court and first and foremost his reports he did not shy away to mention a lot of Russian athletes in his report but testifying in front of the judge he said that basically the fact that he chose to put an athletes in his report does not mean that he makes an accusation against that athlete so basically he first he does not shy away from mentioning from making a mention in a very damning report of a very concrete athlete but then he says that it doesn't mean that that said athlete participated in the doping scheme also he could not explain to the judge as to why he trusted Rodchenko and did not question his his testimony he did not reveal any of alternative sources that he claims he used to put together the report and he could not explain as to why he believes the presumption of innocence did not apply to Russia or Russian athletes and the ball in his opinion was in Russia's court to basically defend itself as a clean nation the sad thing here isn't it is that despite caste taking the side of almost 30 Russian athletes for many of them the damage has been done hasn't it well indeed this February as you mentioned 28 Russian athletes were cleared by casts of all doping allegations and though athletes were banned for their lifetimes from ever participating in any international events including the Olympics so they were cleared in February just before the games in South Korea and still none of them went none of them none of those athletes whose bans were fully overruled of them were invited by the International Olympic Committee to participate in the games although many of them were still acting they still had their careers ongoing and they still they would have loved to participate in the games they would have loved to take part but none of that happened so clearly a lot of Korea's stained Mars and even ruined by that reports and so it's still yet to be seen as to where this whole thing fast sure okay thanks you go that was so our seas you go she's dying off there but we can't get more reaction to her mail his cash more he's professor of sociology at Aston University there's avidly follow these doping stories - good afternoon - oh this thing's thanks for coming I'm coming back on um where does this leave rodchenko's testimony and his credibility do you think I'd never thought his credibility was very strong in the first place and I know the viewers of RT will have seen me over the the last couple of years questioning his testimony all along as you've just explained the whole nucleus of the McLaren investigation and the ultimate report on the so-called state-sponsored doping rested on his testimony and I questioned from the outset how objective or neutral or fair his testimony could have been here's a fugitive let's put it you know let's face it the guy has fled from Russia he does have an axe to grind and so when McLaren based his evidence on the testimony from raging cough I remember saying several months ago I'm a researcher I do this thing for a living if someone tells me a story I want to substantiate that all right what do what we call triangulate it by talking to other witnesses to see it ties together and the clown didn't do this so the answer to your question is that basically I never thought he'd have any credibility to begin with it has less still now and where does this leave the overall claim then that the whole country was doping because some people might argue will look some sanctions remain against Russian athletes you know we're not saying there wasn't any doping but it's the scale isn't it the scale of the accusation that was made to start with let's not kid ourselves Andrew there is doping going on in Russia no question about that but it's going on every other country in the world as well so the scale of it we don't know the the systemic operation that McLaren refers to we don't know about that what we do know is that Russia has denied any knowledge of this this has led to a kind of a standoff between Russia and the Athletics governing organization that is the idle AF who is still saying Russia cannot compete on the world stage in athletics until it admits that there has been state-sponsored doping so you have this ridiculous situation now where Russia is saying we don't know anything about this state-sponsored doping why do you want us to confess to something we have no knowledge of and as long as that standoff continues Russia won't be readmitted to athletics and of course it's a world power in track and field so the the victim of this really is sport as well as Russia but I don't really see any immediate resolution to this problem well that's that's very true because Russia's been told look you have to admit the findings TV findings of the McLaren report before you can get reinstate it doesn't it all become compliant again but you can't give them what blood chunk of just said or hasn't said I'm just sorry I'll go bring in a colorful analogy it reminded me of the old Witchfinder general of the 17th century you know they used to travel around the country and in Britain and say find old women who are suspected of witchcraft and say look if you confess to being a witch we will just drown you but if you don't we'll burn you so either way you lose and Russia is losing both ways at the moment somebody has got to budge on this and I think that the further court of arbitration ruling about the lack of credibility of regime cop will actually make a few people at the IDA Belaya particularly Lord Coe we hope think twice about this decision because it is absurd okay and so I could always talk to you a lot longer but we weren't it's time thanks very much for coming onto our tea that was Ellis Cashmore professor of sociology at Aston University thank you
