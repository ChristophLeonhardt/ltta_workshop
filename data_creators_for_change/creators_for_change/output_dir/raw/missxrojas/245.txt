16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,250
Prince Charles cinema which I actually

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be wondering why cinema in</font>

20
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,739
2013 is showing a film that came out

21
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,899
nearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years ago the Prince Charles</font>

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,640
was an independent cinema<font color="#E5E5E5"> that space to</font>

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,110
kind of just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop Leicester Square just</font>

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,030
around the corner from big view cinnamon

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">a big Empire cinema and Leicester Square</font>

26
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,570
is where they hold a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,550
important film<font color="#E5E5E5"> prairie and so tonight</font>

28
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,230
for example they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the anchorman</font>

29
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,030
premiere and we just saw them taking

30
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,680
down on the gates from that the great

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about Prince Charles's that well</font>

32
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,369
it does show some current films it also

33
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,500
focuses<font color="#CCCCCC"> on showing those cult favorite</font>

34
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,869
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> classic Hollywood films</font>

35
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,420
or things like home alone or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV</font>

36
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,220
shows they have marathons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Breaking</font>

37
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,229
Bad and Veronica Mars and so on the

38
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,400
tickets aren't prohibitively expensive

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,439
and if you remember you can also get

40
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,420
discounts but I do have to say that my

41
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,979
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about the cinema other</font>

42
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,509
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it being independent because you</font>

43
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,009
know how I love the indie is that it

44
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,240
fosters it's really great dance

45
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,340
community in communal viewing it's like

46
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,079
having a film light with your friends

47
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,670
and your friends of all friends and

48
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're all watching is filmmaking</font>

49
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,790
absolutely love<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're absolutely</font>

50
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,320
obsessed with in the same way that

51
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,820
finding people who love the things you

52
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,950
love on tumblr or YouTube or whatever

53
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,619
it's like filing that in real life with

54
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,450
complete strangers for a couple of hours

55
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you watch this film or TV show or</font>

56
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,310
whatever it is you really really love

57
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,079
that sounds like something so basic but

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,920
especially with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

59
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really young</font>

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">any vessel then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would see them with</font>

61
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">your parents and your family or you will</font>

62
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,579
only ever seen them on these small

63
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,320
screen this great time<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to</font>

64
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,420
either seats in row again as you're the

65
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,070
first time or have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunity to</font>

66
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,420
see it in the cinema because you missed

67
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,190
it the first time around so when I was

68
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,989
with it love<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually today's they sort</font>

69
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,610
of thumb for the first time at the

70
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,810
Prince Charles cinema and they've never

71
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,459
seen it before they hadn't even seen it

72
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the small screen on their TV or</font>

73
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,700
anything like that but they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

74
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,319
the experience was really rewarding for

75
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,670
that reason for having that sense of

76
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,560
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into it and just being</font>

77
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,060
surrounded by people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who get really</font>

78
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,830
really love this thing and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

79
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,330
of those places where<font color="#E5E5E5"> this huge city</font>

80
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,770
starts to feel a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more like a</font>

81
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,780
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it feels like someone that</font>

82
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,430
