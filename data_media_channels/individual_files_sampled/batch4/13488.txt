former UN Ambassador John Bolton takes on the job of national security advisor this week in the aftermath of a chemical attack in Syria Bolton is proposing a new approach to the Syrian civil war and released a statement to reporters saying quote before we respond to the Syrian chemical attack I think we should all drink a soothing cup of mint tea and maybe do some meditation I'm thinking if we drop plane loads of beautiful daisies on Damascus we might put the leadership there in a more peaceful mood then we could Park ships off the coast playing John Lennon's Imagine over and over so that Bashar Assad can begin to think about the world living as one and maybe attain a higher state of consciousness with a greater appreciation of the blessings of peace some yoga might also help unquote the White House later issued a clarification saying the statement had not come from Bolton but from 60s artist Peter Max who has a similar mustache which is what got them confused the real ball says we should bomb the Syrian navy into radioactive splinters although he liked the idea of playing the John Lennon song while we do it trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan

decided that the really the future will be stamp out conservatives all together and just have one party no one's ever thought of this idea before it really took a Silicon Valley genius to come up with the notion that every place should be California where essentially we only have one party and he wrote this big piece saying the next time you call for bipartisan cooperation in America and long for Republicans and Democrats to work side by side stop it remember the great lesson of California the harbinger of America's political future and realized that today such bipartisan cooperation simply can't get done and then he basically says we should just wipe out the right not in it's gonna eat says it's a civil war not a bloody civil war but we should just crush them the way they ascent I mean there's now no looking party here in California and even that's not entirely true California is so huge that there are plenty of Republicans here but they have been eliminated essentially from government so he puts out this this piece saying and look how well he says California is running that's the other thing because California had this debt crisis they raised taxes and now they claim oh we're running it in a surplus so I'll talk about that in just a minute but the thing I want to point out is when he published this article Jack Dorsey of Twitter retweeted it with the line great read great read and this is Jack Dorsey who's pinned message on Twitter is we're committing Twitter to help increase the collective health openness and civility of public conversation and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress let me translate that for you we are going to screw conservatives because we hate them that's what that means and that's why they're apparently even shadow banning Ted Cruz apparently they Ted Cruz can't get his message out so I mean this is what they're talking about now just just to pause for a minute and talk about California this absolute fantasy that we have beaten our debt project and now everything is great because the people voted higher taxes the people did vote higher taxes did eliminate the immediate debt that we have so now you've got higher taxes and fewer services right I mean the same amount of services or pay more for less but what they don't tell you is that there is a tidal wave a tsunami of pension debt that has been building up in this state that somebody's gonna have to pay for and that means the state will go broke meanwhile our education system is one of the worst in the country it is a terrible education system and the people are leaving I mean we have to understand that California is paradise in terms of its you know it's weather in terms of its atmosphere in terms of its beautiful views and it's coast area it is paradise is being solely owned and supported by the tech industry this left wing tech industry but people are leaving in droves like something like a million people net as more people come in and people leave a million people a year are leaving and heading for the better red states where there's jobs and stuff and who are those people they're the middle class the rich are coming in the rich are coming here because they can afford the high taxes and the my property costs and they can put their kids in praat in public private schools they don't have to go and become slaves to the teachers unions this so this state is becoming Venezuela it's becoming Venezuela communism always guts the middle class it leaves the hyper rich and the poor and then the hyper rich get eaten last because the powerful people say oh now we take all their money and we can keep buying the the loyalty of the poor before they set us all on fire California is going down the drain and that's that's the truth and this whole thing that is just going great we've got one party so there no arguments is ridiculous but but it points to an important point they are not in an argument we are in a discussion we are in a debate they the left is not they are in a war of eradication and that is why I want to focus for just a minute on this kind of silly thing that happened between Sean Hannity and Jimmy Kimmel okay now I understand this is a country where everyone's had the lincoln-douglas debates and now we have Hannity and Kimmel's you're shouting homosexual slur slurs at one another but it's important to just watch this because people make fun of Hannity especially like the intellectuals but Hannity could teach them all a lesson right here Kimmel went out and he made fun of the first lady's accent she was reading books to children on Easter and he made fun do we have that clip House Easter celebration would be complete without storytime from our first lady never stop exploring because life would be boring be clever and curious just like a cat ask lots of questions about this and you realize what this means you could be First Lady of the United so so Hannity goes after him on Twitter just stop picking on a woman who can't fight back and he calls him mr. Harvey Weinstein jr. because he says he because of shows he did that he remember he had the man show and he was always doing these hoaxes on girls and in the street and so he played a couple of them Hannity just said I'm gonna just play all this stuff to remind you of who Jimmy Kimmel is in this world of me too and he played here's a clip of Kimmel going out on the street and playing this prank on girls were going by guess what's in my pants now I've stopped something in my pants and you're allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants you had ten seconds to then guess what is in my pants you ready go you should use two hands to head give it a mega fine why Jimmy doesn't need to do time maybe it will be easier if you put your mouth on you've got a nice technique there you could get in the Olympics with this let me tell you so the debate ever elevating the cultural conversation Hannity calls Kimmel an assclown and Kimmel goes insane first of all Kimmel says when your clown makeup rubs off on Trump's ass does it make his butt look like a creamsicle so he starts in with this you know homosexual stuff so now he's in trouble with gay people for using them so to speak is the butt of his jokes sorry but you know walked into that before I knew where I was going but and now Kimmel goes on the air with this and he really just goes absolutely crazy this is this is cut 11 I do not speak ass clown though what even is an ass clown I was thinking about it this morning huh is it an ass that's a clown or is it a clown that actually lives in an ass like a little bozo bird in your butt cheeks I honestly don't know and more importantly why is sean hannity openly fantasizing about clowns in the ass is that your thing at night at 2:00 a.m. you got your laptop open a Breitbart you sneak into the den to hump a pillow from the Ivanka Trump collection quietly so your wife doesn't wake up and force you to go to church so Shawn just won't stop and he just hammers Kimmel and he hammers him and he keeps bringing up the creepy jokes and he keeps bringing up the creepy jokes and finally Kimmel surrenders haven't Hannity says I'm gonna keep at you until you apologize to the first lady and Kimmel finally sends out a tweet saying while I admit I did have fun with our back-and-forth after some thought I realized that the level of vitriol from all sides mine and me included does nothing good for anyone and in fact is harmful to our country even in 2018 the vile attacks against my wife and wishes for death on my infant son is shocking and I encourage those who made them to give their words and actions thought I too will give my words more thought and recognize my role in inciting their hatefulness I will take Sean Hannity at his word that he was genuinely offended what I buy but what I believed and still believed to be a harmless and silly aside referencing our first lady's accent mrs. Trump almost certainly has enough to worry about without being used as a prop to increase TV ratings it's a snarly apology when you get down into it he's not really apologizing and he's not really saying this wrong but but it actually was strike back it actually showed that Kimmel couldn't take the heat because Kimmel is a hypocrite Kimmel is a guy who is just does anything that he thinks is gonna work and keep his audience coming in and he has been an absolute pain he has been it's just absolutely wrong to use a network show which is on the public air to attack one side relentlessly over and over and over again and and I'll talk about why I'm talking about this in just a minute but first we have to talk about zip recruiter because I know a lot of you you know you come into the Daily

Michael Knowles happen to you zip recruiter is the smart smartest way to hire all right so why am I talking about this here is a meeting they left held a meeting to discuss their attitude toward the right and how they want to you know have the debate between left and right in this country here's the left speaking at that meeting I wanna I want his family dead I want his house burnt to the ground I want to are not giving any quarter so people make fun of Sean Hannity and they say oh you've got down in the dirt with Jimmy Kimmel oh you know you you lowered the level of our conversation by talking about ass clowns and all this stuff but but when people say remember when people would say well Trump is this and Trump is that but he fights at least he fights and the intellectuals were saying oh no oh no he's so awful well Trump may be awful he may be rude but the fighting part the fighting part can be excised from that and remembered let me give you an example my friend Kevin Williamson at the National Review call my friend maybe I should call my pal he's not a close friend but he's a guy I know uh yeah I met Kevin Williamson on a NRO tour and I he was obscure then he wasn't very famous I didn't I didn't recognize him I didn't know his name I didn't hadn't read any of his stuff and we got to talking on the bus going to the cruise ship I was talking to him for about 90 seconds when I realized oh my this guy is brilliant this is a brilliant cultural guy and he was so brilliant that when he recommended that I read Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace I did it took me three months it was awful I made fun of it in another Kingdom in our podcast fictional podcast another Kingdom I made fun of it I called that guy had a novelist who published a book called a thousand pages of self referential drivel that was the name of the book that was Infinite Jest I told Kevin I was never forgiving him for this so kevin is a an acerbic deadpan hyperbolic terrific writer and a strong anti-trump ER he hates Trump but he's a conservative and he says shocking things and he does it with a deadpan sense of humor and so the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg at the Atlantic hired him to bring a little diversity of opinion to his magazine his left crew his left-wing magazine and so the hit the hits went out against Kevin right away they started saying oh he said these terrible terrible things and they do what they always do the left has this trick where they take jokes and they make them sound serious and then they can always get a couple of women upset about that and the women start screaming about it and then finally they say this is so shocking so Kevin Williamson was opposes abortion and he said that women who have abortions should be hanged because it's homicide and he said this in several times Kevin has an absolutely stone dead face deadpan sense of humor he will say these deadpan things he did clarify in a speech at Hillsdale College that he didn't actually believe this but that didn't stop anything Media Matters the David Brock Soros group right which is just all it is is a left-wing hip group and David Brock remember as the guy who started this fake news thing so he could worm his way into Facebook and Twitter and Google which he did and get left-wing censors of conservative speech that was it was a planned thing it was really well done and it has succeeded they put out this thing saying oh my gosh this hiring of Kevin Williams is so so terrible here are some horrible quotes that Kevin Williamson has said over the years and they put out this piece we're probably waterboarding people somewhere I certainly hope so and no matter how you feel about it no matter what you want to say about it no matter which pronouns you deploy Laverne Cox is a man masquerading as a woman Eastern European engineers are one thing we've got 13 million Mexican peasants that we've imported over the last 20 years who aren't really contributing well what supremacy like YouTube privilege in these very city things they're the phlogiston of political rhetoric right you know it's an imaginary substance but it can be used to explain anything people should start using you know Elmer Fudd's deer rifle in crimes it would actually be much much more dangerous than you so-called assault weapons which are sort of scary-looking but they're not actually great dangerous guns maya angelou essentially was a kind of cultural mascot a sort of literary character that we tend to attach to older african-american women kind of cultural avatars that are sent here to teach white liberals the meaning of life things that always kind of offended me about Michelle Obama is that every speech she gives she gripes about having to pay back her student loans and how hard it was to pay back her student loans where I come from when someone loans you money to do something that you want to do that's a favor and they don't want a national registry if he runs guns because they do believe that at some point he'll be seized I don't think that's an entirely irrational or paranoid location so was there anything in there factoring in his sense of humor in factoring in a little hyperbole was there anything there that was untrue was that you know that was so shocking to media matters that he said that you should pay your loans back that's what was shocking or that our gun registry upsets gun owners because they know the left is looking to repeal the Second Amendment and confiscate all those guns which they clearly are I mean did he say anything in that that you hear the danger music in the background Jeffrey Goldberg fired him after two weeks so you hire a guy away from his job right you hire him away from the job where he is a respected member of his community and his work space you offer him this great big job oh we love you because you hate Trump we're gonna make you part of our wonderful mainstream media and then you fire him you leave the unemployed with no you know that is a crappy thing to do it's it's cowardly it's it's mean it's small and it just shows you I mean here's and so so here's the thing the right I understand the left hates the guy they're targeting the guy but the right kind of dithers about this stuff right so SE Cupp and this I love SE Cupp she's a wonderful person she does a great job on TV but she says you know you can't really defend this guy because he was saying that people wouldn't who have abortion should be hanged and you know you've gotta if you have a respect for life it has to be a respect for life on all ends and you know we I can't defend the things that he said and other people Ross do thought is saying well he's an abortion extremists and all this again I think the hanging remark is a joke but but the point the point is I don't agree with a lot of what Kevin writes I loved reading his stuff but I don't agree with a lot of what he writes I didn't agree with his you know over-the-top Trump attacks I didn't agree with some of the stuff he wrote about Hillbillies I mean he had a very difficult upbringing Kevin so he has no patience with people who are on the dole and people who were using opioids and things like this and he talks about them with disparages them you know I don't agree with this I loved reading his pieces because they were brilliantly written really well reasoned oftentimes I disagree but here's the point when I disagreed with him I didn't explode I didn't burst into flame I didn't melt and die or anything like that you know the internet meme did you die I didn't die I just kind of honed my own arguments against Kevin's and that made me smarter and then went on and lived my life and this is true of even people that I hate and even people who have opinions that I despise racist opinions or Nazi opinions or whatever they don't they can't touch me it's when you suppress them it's when you repress them that they become powerful it's not when they meet other arguments I can argue against all those guys and they don't bother me but Kevin is a respectable guy you know a respectable guy he's not filled with hate he's not a hate monger the the left has moved that bar so far where whatever you say this conservative is suddenly fascist unacceptable dangerous it violates my safe space or whatever so they can silence you so they can eradicate these opinions and it's serious you know it may not be I mean I think Jeffrey Goldberg does terrible thing I think he's you know he's a man of respect he's a man who sent a message to the community oh these opinions are not acceptable it's not acceptable to be against abortion it's not acceptable to make jokes and it's always the right it's never the left's jokes I mean the left sits around saying all kinds of crazy stuff but their jokes are fine but it's always the right but it becomes serious for instance in the matter of Scott Pruett the head of the EPA Scott Pruett has been the victim first of all Scott Pruett has been great he has been one of trumps best people he has done all this stuff where he's eradicated all these environmental rules that weren't improving the environment but were damaging business and were giving the government too much power over your workplace and where you were so he he rescinded this is one year he rescinded the waters of the u.s. rule that sought to regulate every pond in America reading this from The Wall Street Journal proposed to repeal the clean power plan rule that sought to put coal out of business urged the President to withdraw from the Paris climate pact made a priority of cleaning up genuine pollution problems like Superfund sites and this week he began revising the destructive Obama you're a fuel economy standards so they went after him and they had all these bogus ethics charges against him he rented an apartment and you know from a friend who might have been a lobbyist who was whose husband was a lobbyist who might whose firm might have brought stuff in front of the EPA he gave a raise to people in his business so he went on air with Edie Henry who's an excellent reporter over at Fox and Henry really laced into him I'm just gonna play one clip of that because I want to get to Michael Knowles but he really grilled him so let's let's play the first edge Henry Scott Pruett cut why does it matter when the ethics officials look at the lease in the terms of lease to determine whether it's that's what does it matter it's because you're renting it from the wife of lobbyists yeah who has no business before they say hold on a second so that's no part is is that Williams and Jensen right major lobbying firm ExxonMobil is a client mr. Hart mr. Hart has no clients that has business before this agency ExxonMobil has no sphere he's that he's a member of a law firm to take his relationship and ignore me to third port ExxonMobil have business be extended to third parties in his firm is is absolutely a stretch but heed let me say this to you you ask me whether this is about the toxicity in Washington DC and I will tell you it is it's about the mission that we're engaged in here and this arrangement is against been signed off as I've indicated to you an offense they've been stated by the ethics officials here Karissa ethics officials this individual doesn't have clients that have business before this agency and and at the same time we are doing these very important things and the criticism I think this is just one of things that people bring up okay so have an answer of ExxonMobil has business before you the firm millions of it Steve Hart does not represent Exxon Mobil so this does this interview was called disastrous appoints Pruitt was stuttering Henry was hammering and hammering and hammering I want to be clear and Henry's job is to hammer public officials I hope he does it that every single public official who comes on so Henry is doing his job but you can do this to anybody I could hammer you about the last you know a couple of things you did and I could make you look bad and you would stutter and at one point Henry even admits that Obama's people did this this is the thing and nothing nothing that Pruett has done wasn't done by officials before him and Henry's point was yes but you're supposed to drain the swamp okay fair enough Pruitt should understand that he's the position he's in he should understand that he's a target he should be like Caesar's wife above suspicion I get it but we should not in any way I mean you know the chief of staff Kelly was telling Trump to fire him according to sources don't fire this guy he's one of the best guys you get you know if he needs to clean up his act a little film to clean up but we have got to fight these people because you know this is the thing it I'm all for conversation I'm all for debate but when their idea of debate is your shadow band your band are we're changing our algorithm so you don't your your show up on our Google searches we're defunding your videos on YouTube when that's their form of debate they are instantly in the wrong and we need to fight back we shouldn't dither about this stuff it's not a question I mean I'm perfectly happy to talk about whether Kevin Williamson is right on one day or wrong on another day nothing as there's nothing to do with it but Goldberg should be ashamed of himself the Atlantic should be ashamed of themselves true it should be defended I mean this is ridiculous you know you don't want if you don't want people fighting like Trump with the insults and the meanness and the and the over-the-top remarks if you don't want people fighting like Hannity getting down at the level of Jimmy Kimmel and using that kind of language then fight at a higher level but fight there these guys are popular and that kind of rhetoric is popular because the intellectuals are dithering and they're letting this campaign of silence go on without standing up to it so if you don't want to fight like Trump don't fight like Trump but fight like Trump at least at least do that what Trump does and fight all right we got Michael Knowles coming up I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube you are hereby cast into the exterior darkness where there is great weeping and gnashing of teeth but you can come over over to the daily wire comm you can listen to the rest of the show while you're there subscribe allow Z 10 bucks a month and you can be in the mailbag every week or on the conversation tomorrow which will be with me and you can ask me all the questions that you have I will solve all your problems your life will be like a gleaming new thing that you can hardly even recognize all right we got Michael Knowles coming up Knowles can you hear me death help me to wake up you're on the air I can't believe when I use a movie passport now by the way speaking of our topic today is now with movie pass all the movies are free yes so even if the movies are terrible which most of the more I'll just go and take a nice nap that's great it's pretty nice it is dark it's quiet nobody bothering so you were you were travelling to say almost the same time we were kind of traveling it like the opposite weeks or something like this and you were giving speeches to kids too right this is the longest you and I have gone without drinking and smoking cigars since I moved out here I think I noticed that I think we have a moral obligation to reconnect and that's right but yeah I gave a speech at yeshiva and I gave a speech up at Ithaca College two weeks ago and then you were gone all of last week right and it was a pretty interesting experience because the crowds were a little different and I was protested at Ithaca with one of the best lines I've ever heard which is I don't know who you are but I hate you I've always felt that way that's right I feel that way about you today I don't know who you are but I hate this yeah what was your trip like you know it was first of all I did this thing after I did Hobart Williams Hobart which is right up in the Ithaca area I went down to New York and I did a thing at the Manhattan Institute and that was great I mean it was very very it was kind of they're big contributors to the Manhattan Institute and they just interviewed me and we talked and we had a dinner for a select few of them afterwards and that was sensational I mean people really engaged really intelligent people with a lot on the line at the at the universe at the college I had a great time I thought that the Conservatives who invited me were wonderful people what were they called the youth young Americans for free for freedom I think it was yeah and and they were great and the and the kids who objected to me were all incredibly polite and incredibly reasonable but I just felt that they were so imbued with this race narrative and this sex narrative that they actually cannot hear what you're talking about and it's a way of stopping them from thinking and I actually think that it's like a form of child abuse like at one point is to counter my speech they gave a speech praising communism and I just thought you know dude if you are teaching communism is a good thing to children you're not a good person that's not a moral thing to do you know it's also sad because of the people who object some of them I think we're earnestly trying to find some reality they were trying to hear this political reality that they've never heard of but they're so profoundly uneducated and uncultured yeah I don't mean I mean that like children like they're like children who were neglected in their education and their acculturation so to even hear of some of these ideas to even hear the name I don't know Aristotle is shocking to them it's never happened before III agree I agree I actually asked I don't like the quiz people you know cuz it seems like but I actually asked if anybody knew who Aristotle student was and when one guy raised his hand I was so glad that somebody knew that he had taught Alexander the Great you know right right alright let's talk about Chappaquiddick I'm talking about depriving people of information how is it I haven't seen it yet but I'm really eager to see it is so good I will say put down your Aristotle and go go see it it's so so good it finally depicts Teddy Kennedy for the absolute abject degenerate that he was yeah it's unrelenting in its portrayal and that there was a guy who wrote this guy Neil gobbler who wrote in the New York Times I guess he was doing a biography of Ted Kennedy he's very upset now he said it's a character assassination Teddy Kennedy's character committed suicide a long time ago doesn't need to be assassinated I like Teddy Kennedy gets assassinated but it's Mary Jo Kopechne who's dead he says that the film was dishonest but he he never actually points out any dishonest portrayal the one thing is he says that Bruce Dern as Joe Kennedy senior should have slobbered around a little bit more or something that's the only historical inaccuracy he points to it's just a lot of innuendo and they're really upset because finally the Lion of the Senate is exposed for being a womanizing cowardly lout for being just an man basically immune to virtue none of the virtues excuse me none of the virtues did Ted Kennedy possess and and they really did I mean it just is absolutely true that the left defended him to the day he died and the day he died when remember Andrea Mitchell saying oh the the heavens are weeping for Ted Kennedy because it rained on the day they back you know they did defend this this clown the entire time the the thing that we can oh all of this movie to it's not that there are conservatives now infiltrating Hollywood that isn't happening the director came out and he said he was asked to do an interview on Hannity he said no effing way I'm not embracing the right okay so this was these were not conservatives finally exposing that would be too much to ask not at all that would be too much to ask it wasn't that basically everybody associated that with this movie appears to be politically left what I think this is is not because Hollywood has embraced Republicans but because Democrats have embraced the left so there is this intersectional narrative now that in the age finally the Clintons are no longer politically useful finally the Kennedys are no longer politically useful were in a new age where a straight white men or the enemy that's the new moral framework of the intersectional left and so a guy like Teddy Kennedy he's the prime case of the me2 movement he got absolutely smashed he tried to cheat on his wife he took the single girl off into the woods somewhere and then drove off a bridge and killed her and left her to drown there I think they're finally willing to turn on him is that a good thing for the culture I don't know that that's really an improvement other than we can finally watch them smack around Bill Clinton and the Kennedys but it is fun to watch the hyenas of the intersectional Left devour the Lion of the Senate you can get some popcorn to watch that you know it also I also think in some ways it's a good thing that we finally see that the Democrat Party is the vehicle for communist thought and in the same way in the same way that the Republican Party is the vehicle but not the it's not the exact same thing as those people who believe in the Constitution and believe in free I mean that we we conservatives we you believe in the Constitution we kind of travel along with the Republicans because they're as close as we can get to a popular point of view with whatever the hell the publicans believe I have no idea but everything that conservatives travel along in the same way the Democrats the Communists essentially travel along with the Democrats and have now taken over the vehicle they are now the Democrat Party is now a leftist fully fledged leftist party and the fact that they would go on and attack Teddy Kennedy is just the farthest circular firing squad it just shows you that they will devour their own they're finally eating their own which is really nice and it the byproduct of this which is probably not a good thing it's great I suppose it's more honest to now that the Democrats have fully embraced the left it's probably not a good thing for the culture but one of the benefits is we get a little bit of truth thirty years too late forty years too late about this absolute derelict the Kennedys are a scourge upon American politics they have debased American politics from the beginning back when Joe Kennedy was running rum John F Kennedy had a lot of irregularities in that election a lot of evidence that he stole that election all of them were just absolute bottom feeders on American politics and the narrative that they were glamorous the narrative of Camelot has finally been punctured that's a good thing I can't complain about that yeah yeah yeah you know it is something we're all gonna have to come to terms with is the idea that what what do we do with bad people who do good things or people who are not who are imperfect as we all are who do good things you know we support you know I you know I have my problems with Donald Trump but I think he had a great first year in office I don't know what to say about that that doesn't make me you know want to leave my daughter alone in a room with Donald Trump you know I I don't know exactly you know how to respond but the only thing that is good about it is that we can now stop accepting a slurs and attacks on the character of our candidates knowing that these guys have been defending the worst of the worst and it's not like on the right where you get an occasional person defending you know Roy Clark or whatever on the left it has been ABC NBC CBS CNN the New York Times The Washington Post they have been defending this guy who left this girl to drown and then went and changed his clothes so he had an alibi while she drowned I mean did they depict all this in the movie I don't know I shouldn't say give anything away it's a historical thing but Ryan depict this as as brutally as it was I did a review of this in the Daily wire and I had this question I said oh well I'm spoiling the movie oh wait a minute we've known about this for 40 years if you've read any actual historical accounts they depict it brutally honestly and they do not embellish there is no embellishment that I can find every single cowardly awful vicious action taken by Ted Kennedy is easily pointed to in the historical record but they really portray him for just being a terrible derelict and a terrible degenerate and it one nice thing on this question of bad people who do good things not that Ted Kennedy did good things but hypothetically is is what about what about ISM they say don't you can't say what about him only talk about your guy why not we're finally getting a little clearer historical record where we're seeing reality more clearly that's what what about does it say well this is true and this is true and this is true that's a good thing I'm glad that that's finally happening there's nothing wrong with that that's right and because the Pratt the Left owns the press because they own the media what they can do is cover stuff up for 30 years and then when you talk about it they say well that's old news that's right I think like well no it's new news because you didn't report it at the time you know with the Clintons they cover it up for three weeks and then this how it's old news I think Ozzie it's old so what are you talking about on the show today today I'm talking about a nation of drug addicts all of the new information showing that from marijuana use all the way up through antidepressants and opioids Americans are drugging themselves at record numbers and we'll try to figure out why exactly that is you know that is my closing discussion on our crappy culture I'm gonna talk about that too and I'll be her to hear what you have to say because it's huge it's that it is a big big thing and it refutes all these people who tell us oh just look you know rule by experts is going great just stay out of our way well the only reason I'm doing it from so as I knew that I could hear the end of your show and then I wouldn't have to write a short just just say it you know and so tune in be sure if you miss at the end of Drew's I'm here to serve I am here to serve all right cigars and whiskey soon let's do it like now I'm playing the spark up right when the camera goes up it's great talking it alright let us move from Knowles with a smooth segue how it's almost not a segue from Knowles to our crappy culture all right a headline in the New York Times a former newspaper many people taking antidepressants discover they cannot quit big surprise all right long-term use of antidepressants is surging in the united states according to a new analysis of federal data by the New York Times some fifteen point five million Americans have been taking the medications for at least five years the rate has almost doubled since 2010 and more than tripled since 2000 nearly twenty five million adults have been on antidepressant for at least two years a sixty percent increase since 2010 and then they go on to say and I agree with this by the way the drugs have helped millions of people I don't know if millions bi probably millions with drugs to help people ease depression and anxiety and are widely regarded as milestones and psychiatric treatment many people stop the medications without significant trouble but the rise in longtime uses also the result of an unanticipated and growing problem many who try to quit say they cannot because of withdrawal system symptoms they were never warned about and then later in the piece they have a doctor dr. Alan Francis professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University most people are put on these drugs in primary care after a very brief visit and without clear symptoms of a clinical depression usually there's improvement and often it's based on the passage of time or placebo effect now here's what I want to say because I you know I'm not a fanatic about this like you know I think Tom Cruise thinks oh my gosh there shouldn't be any psychiatry there shouldn't be any drug I got depressed when I was I've talked about this a lot when I was in my I guess I was like about nine eighteen nineteen I went to college and I fell into what I now recognize as a clinical depression leaping 15 16 hours a day I could barely speak I was drinking I could walk around like that greyface I could barely communicate with other human beings and I knew something at first I just thought I had the longest cold in history you know but after a while even I is this is a kid when people weren't talking about depression or anything like this it starts real something is terribly terribly wrong with me now I am I mean nowadays I have to deal with people socially all the time and it's fine but back in those days I you know I was very shy I didn't want to communicate with things I never joined anything I forced myself to do it I understood that I had to do something to get me out I make sure I showed up for my friends poker game I joined the campus radio station I did all these things that I had not been doing I made sure I was at you know certain meetings that I had to go to did all those things that I had never done and normally would never have done and it brought me up out of my depression it brought me up out of the depression now obviously I had to go through a crisis later in life to deal with these things but I dealt with I never was drugged for any of this and at one point the psychiatrist I was saying offered me valium I filled the subscription I mean the prescription I never took a pill because I just didn't believe in it I wanted to battle through myself okay I understand that there are people that keep telling me this I've never met one but they keep telling me that there are people who get depressed and can't deal with their depression so you give them some drugs and that lightens their load and then they can deal with the depression then they get off the drugs I keep hearing about that but I also see a lot of people who spend their entire lives adjusting the dosage because it's not quite right and they're just a chemistry set who needs to be adjusted here's my point here's my point if somebody comes in and is depressed to a psychiatrist shouldn't the first thing they do we talk to them shouldn't the first thing they do we recommend to them that they force themselves to get out and that they come back and report to the psychiatrist did you join this club is there a club you can join is there a place you can go where you can talk to other people isn't that the first thing you do instead of treating people like their chemistry sets because underlying this and I have read the literature underlying this is a theory that essentially that's all you are you are just a chemistry set that can be adjusted to get the dosages us right and then you'll be fine and they do this with children all the time which i think is a sin you know the kid comes in and he's acting up especially boys and they say well it's got a tension deficit disorder and it can follow gize anything pathology pathologizing means turning something into a disease you can say you know we'd like always attention deficit disorder instead of oh he's a boy you're asking him to sit still like a girl boys don't sit still like girls take him outside and get him some exercise instead of drugging him up to make him easy for you to deal with the question we should be asking ourselves as one what is the nature of a human being what do we really believe about being a human being and since the scientists and the experts aren't gonna ask it you have to ask it you have to ask it about your kid you have to ask it about yourself you have to ask it about the situation you're in am I really suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it the fact that my wife just walked out the door that's depressed me you know what what is it that is making me upset and how can I best deal with it because the experts won't deal with it because they will always go to the materialist answer you have to ask those questions can I join a church can I join a synagogue can I start doing things in my community that will get me out of this depression and you know Mike my question for all these experts who know so much and have made our world so great is don't you give a damn do you not care about these people are you just wondering do you just want to make things easier for you because of course it's easier for you when a depressed person gets drug of course it's easier for you when your kid stops running around and screaming because you gave him a drug and now he's happy he's doing great he's doing great because we we started you know we were reluctant to give him drugs but once we did he's doing great is he doing great or are you doing better because he's not bothering you I mean if we are going to turn this kind of thing around it's gonna be us it's gonna be on the ground that's gonna be the person next to you you know I I know that this is about religion but even religion I know that it's because we people have lost their God and they don't know what their lives are about and what they're for anymore but even with religion the country doesn't need religion you need it the guy next to you needs it it's not the society that needs it the society can only get it one person at a time the same is true of curing depression it can only happen one person at a time and not everybody responds to drugs and drugs are not the first answer you should go to because once you do that my question is these guys peddle drugs these psychiatrists peddle drugs what's their answer when people say like oh yeah I'm on heroin I'm on opiates you know I mean you you gave me one drug I took another drug what's the diff you know I think that there's a whole question of how we view human beings all right tomorrow who's gonna be on Rob michael is a Smith's tomorrow yes yes we have oh we have a man is written he's a Catholic priest I believe and he has written a book about how against gay marriage and against gay relationships we're gonna let him explain and ask him pertinent questions be there for that I will be and the conversation is tomorrow as well I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show the Andrew Clavin show is produced by Robert Sterling executive producer
