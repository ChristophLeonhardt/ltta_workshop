the head of a UN team looking into possible war crimes in Yemen has accused Saudi Arabia and the UAE of interference the panel says both sides of the conflict are to blame for rights abuses but what can this inquiry achieve in Yemen this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim Jim Yemen has been at war for more than three years now the region's poorest country has been reduced to even further misery as the sodium Iran tea coalition continues to battle Houthi rebels for control now the head of a UN Group investigating allegations of abuse in the country says his team faced interference from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates the group has submitted its findings to the United Nations we have a lot to discuss with our guests but first Bernard Smith has more kemal gen Dubey says the Yemen government's rejection of his team of experts report is political he says the Saudis in the Emiratis tried to influence his team they tried to damage its credibility but they didn't manage and indeed the Mandate of the team of experts work in Yemen has been extended by the UN but Jen do be admits because the Yemen government has it has said it's no longer going to cooperate with the team of experts and that will make their work in Yemen much more difficult and Jen Dubey says that they've submitted a confidential list of names of suspected human rights violators to the UN in New York I did not expect such harsh reactions we've done a professional neutral and objective job all we did was report based on allegations and actions we collected during our visits from testimonies and reports it's a normal process for any experts we can always discuss the results but this did not happen now the UN's team of experts report into Yemen faults all sides accuses all parties of human rights violations but much of the criticism is extended towards the Saudi and UAE led coalition specifically for their widespread use of air strikes on targets in Yemen alright let's take a closer look at some of the findings of this report UN experts accuse Yemen's internationally recognized government Saudi Arabia and the UAE of possible war crimes including torture rape and illegal detention the report found that the sodium arathi coalition caused what it calls most of the documented civilian casualties all sides are also accused of recruiting child soldiers the UN is calling for an immediate into fighting and for countries to stop selling weapons to those involved in the war all right let's bring in our guests in London I'm at the Deen of Djibouti political commentator and author of Middle East affairs and joining us on skype from New York Ahmed bin Shem see advocacy and communications director for Middle East North Africa with Human Rights Watch welcome to you all I'm at the Deen of Djibouti let me start with you so the head of the UN group of experts on Yemen Kemal John Dubey he says that both Saudi Arabia and the UAE trying to interfere in their work what do you say to that and what is the response from Saudi Arabia and the UAE obviously Saudi Arabia or the Arab states collusion they are there not for invasion of Yemen but they are there intervened militarily at request of the legitimate Yemeni government so this is very essential point to have and to understand it so but the point is this there are more than one report just so we mentioned about less than two months ago another report it is after you talk about the humanitarian level not involved in politics or talk about politics for the Arab state collusion all along they said we are with the law international human rights law or the international law no abuse no any negative points yes it is war obviously there are some mistakes the Arab estates collusion they said admit about especially with about four or five weeks to cover that the school children bus you know and then they admitted so it means there is no attention to be against the human rights or to be a violation against international law so this is the most important to understand but we have to say you know we're you and they involved with politics not not just typically a humanitarian level I'm a bench emcee look we talk a lot in the news about the allegations of war crimes being committed in Yemen there have been charges that both sides are committing these war crimes could you with the work that you do detail to our viewers some of the types of war crimes that you believe are being committed by both sides in Yemen well there are indeed grave violations of the laws of war committed by both sides and we documented them both so on the saudi-led coalition side we have documented and lawful coalition airstrikes some likely war crimes as you said also the coalition has used cluster munitions which are banned internationally and we have also highlighted the role of the United Arab Emirates in torture and forced disappearances on the Kuti side we have documented indiscriminate shelling of civilians which is again a violation of laws or the use of anti-personnel landmines the use of torture in the detention centers and forced disappearances and also the use of child soldiers reminded in Djibouti so if I can ask you for your response to what you just heard I'm a bench emcee say with regards to the allegations of war crimes committed by both the UAE and Saudi Arabia we have to be logically rationally when we think when the Arab state collusion they admitted they did some stage the war is war on the end of the day but do do do that you have attention to be a violation against the international law or the international human rights law the answer is no so this is we have to be other as I said typically within political part or typically nutrient level so this is they have no attention to tackle in civilian people against I mean when you talk about the Houthi movement I know they do some not mistakes but they do have attention to event to attack some you and sentences I could there with the international food for the UN as well a few weeks ago and her data within one month it was the attack they attacked that centers you know so they do this is this building belong to a United Nation for the humanitarian part why they go there by their forces and to occupied it and they and use it as military for them so obviously this is the the the point of view between the Arab state collusion would they have no attention for revelation and the Hume and the the Houthi movement would they don't have a tension to attack some points belong to the United Nation so logically irrational you have to think who to blame not to the Arab state collusion no but you have to blame Houthi movement and I've stopped to this level mr. Minch MC the human Human Rights Council voted overwhelmingly in the past few weeks and despite opposition from Saudi Arabia and from Yemen to extend the international probe of alleged war crimes does that make you feel at all encouraged that enough pressure can be brought to bear on on the warring parties in Yemen and or on Saudi Arabia and the coalition to try to de-escalate the situation well it is it is indeed a very positive outcome we have called for the renewal of that commission and we are pleased that it was renewed because there is the urgent need for more investigations into grave violations of the laws of war by both parties actually as as for the responsibility of the coalition since my colleague the other guest in this show said that I mean there are my responsibilities mainly lies on the Houthi side and on the coalition side there are merely mistakes I do not agree with that it is more than just mere mistakes and and if it was just that why would the coalition itself not deploy convincing efforts into investigating those mistakes quote-unquote the you know joint coalition investigative reports are extremely insufficient we also reported about that the only release results about one paragraph each on only 56 airstrikes even though we have documented worry more than that their methodologies and clear it is non transparent their findings radically and drastically different from our findings from the findings of the Amnesty International from the findings of the UN we have provided pretty specific numbers on the violations that were committed by this how he said we have documented 87 and I'm talking just about Human Rights Watch documentation they are more on from other organizations 87 apparently lawful coalition attacks kneeling killing nearly a 1000 civilians including more than 200 kids and some attacks amounting to war crimes helicopter attack an involved filled with fleeing Somali refugee is killing women and children at least 33 of them 18 different instances of usage of cluster munitions that aren't banned internationally these are very precise facts and findings so I don't think this is a mere mistake and unintentional errors as your guest explained it's more than that and it needs more investigation and this is why we applaud the decision to extend the Mandate of the investigating committee established by being one all right we'd like to bring in our third guest now from Brighton Lloyd Russell moil a member of parliament with the UK Labour Party he's also a member of the committee's on arms export controls now Lloyd Russell moil let me ask you specifically about the sentiment in the UK right now there has been growing criticism of arms sales from the UK to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates because those bombs those munitions are being used in the war effort in Yemen and so many civilians have been killed there in the past three years what is the sentiment there in the UK right now is there growing criticism of the fact that arms are being sold to Saudi Arabia and the UAE well there is of course a huge amount of concern in in in some significant quarters of society and we see at the moment a case in the Supreme Court to review and try and overturn some of the government's decisions for arms export controls let us remember the government's experts and the civil servants recommended to ministers that the arms should be suspended but the ministers the very top of government overruled it for political reasons this is a clearly a war that Britain is jointly with the coalition to aid and abet what is currently the destruction of large parts of the Yemeni people Misrata worry I want to get back to the point that was being made about the UN Human Rights Council I mean why take such an aggressive attack against the UN Human Rights Council why would Saudi Arabia not want this probe to be extended in the long run doesn't transparency help no as I said the Saudi Arabia night arab emirates they are not against the intention law but you have to understand you cannot fairly and logically to me a common level who they are made Kubb on the regiment government and the forces of the lisbon government supported by the arab state collusion so when united nation look at the hood see who they are as I said made coop on the legitimate government and put them in one level and they look at them in their report the reality the political reality yes they are political reality on the ground but illegal they made coop they should respond and obey to the Security Council number 2016 in 2015 so this is you cannot cross your eyes on it and we say Oh Saudi Arabia cm level with the Houthi who they are this one regime and this one element you can make them in one level and talk to them no no you have to talk to the holy fires they must obey to the Security Council resolution of the account so you cannot put them in one level so obviously there is a crushing and point of view this is what I meant that the Arabic said collusion not against the the international law the war is war there is a mistakes so you cannot put them or judge them and the same level with the host news all along part of the Iranian regime strategic in the Arabic world and they don't respond to a as I mentioned there's a Security Council 2016 they don't respond to the initiative of the Arabic state countries they don't respond even to the Patriot Conference the general Patriot Conference this is three key points they can't find way to end all German but sorry let me let me go to you mr. Russell moilee this is what you wanted to make anyone go ahead but we've just heard a number of things that are objectionable first of all the Yemeni government that is recognized at the moment by the international order is not the legitimate government the president was the only candidate on the ballot at the elections his term has long since passed he is probably the only head of state in the world that has to have a state visit to visit his own capital it is not a legitimate government and that is absolute hogwash secondly the point of what about tree okay we all agree that Houthi rebels have probably committed war crimes and awful things but that doesn't suddenly give you carte blanche to commit war crimes yourself that is the worst portrayal of the international order if they've done something bad doesn't mean you can do something bad and let's be clear if we are expecting Saudi Arabia and the coalition to be upholding international law that means that they can't be selective in it they can't suddenly say well because someone else has done something nasty we will do something nasty again now let us remember this was an internal conflict and an internal war until Saudi Arabia and the coalition illegitimately decided to start invading on the advice of the illegitimate Yemeni government to combat the rebels this is an international should not be an international war it is a civil war that needs conflict resolution and dispute management not more bombs and more murders of children in school buses mr. Benge MC I saw you nodding along there did you want to jump in I know absolutely sir gone what was just said violations on the one side definitely do not justify violations on the other side I just wanted to respond to mr. Jabez you know statement that you cannot put the coalition on the same side or the same level as Houthis where actually there is a number and March 2018 of this year the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights found that the coalition airstrikes were responsible for 61 percent of the very fights and casualties so no they're not exactly the same place they're responsible of more deaths than the routines even though the fifties are responsible for an instrument shelling and sniper fire as I said earlier but in terms of verified casualties the Coalition has more mr. Hauser Amaury did you want to respond to any of them well obviously I for respect to any point of view but the law is law I mean the legitimate government of some others they didn't look at regiment this is up to them we're talking about rank we talk about the leak of the Arabic States we're talking about the Arabic Gulf countries these official parts who they agree this is regiment government who they have right to request any help and they request from the Arab state collusion to help them so this is a this is why you ignore these things you know while make it small the whole problem start from hootie-hoo do they are part of the Iranian strategy in the area so we have to look in the picture on the whole our rule for points I mean for triangles not not to select what we like and ignore what we don't like this is the whole picture the whole problem start from the coop of the Houthi so the hood he must respond and obey to the Security Council and other two things were like you know what what they did with the with the Arabic initiative of the Arab state Gulf plus the party wrote international and the general Patriot who they agreed all along about the these three three main issues but the whole thing why they don't responded correctly because as I said part of the strategy of the Iranian so there are that came from Tehran not from Sanaa so this is the whole problem otherwise today by before tomorrow the war finish in the Yemen if they respond to these three key points so we have to put the pressure on look at the legend on government or the Arabic state collusion but the pressure on the Houthi movement mr. Russell oil I can see that you want to jump in I'm gonna let you have your turn here but but one second I also want to ask you as well about the fact that it's a rather opaque system in the UK by which arms are sold to places like Saudi Arabia and I want to ask you if the public there really knows the extent of arms sales to places like Saudi Arabia please go ahead sir well I think this is the problem isn't it that we currently selling huge amounts of arms servicing those arms and with British companies and the support of the British military and there's never been one vote in parliament about the strategy that that needs to take place in fact both the British government and the UN Security Council agree that this conflict will only be resolved through diplomatic means and they have said that numerous times no one believes that this conflict will actually be resolved through killing and bombing more people but the British government continue to license weapons to go abroad now the licenses are usually inspected by a civil servant and given a yes or no recommendation in the case of Britain they were given a no recommendation to be supplied to Saudi Arabia by the civil servant but the Minister for trade and the very highest in the British government overturned the civil servants than the experts on a political decision to take part in the coalition activities now that's fine but there has been no vote in Parliament it's fine if the British people are wanting it and there is a vote and it is legitimate but the reality is there was no vote the British people have never consented to take part and support the coalition and the coalition's actions are illegal they are not upholding any legitimate government they are killing innocent people and conceding I'm sorry but I just wanna one thing at one point you're making matter what other people do I just want to ask one thing what needs to happen for there to be a vote well I suspect the government needs to be forced into admitting that it is complicit in some of these crimes now this latest report showing that that routinely the Coalition has ignored some of the identified safe zones some of the work showing that the joint investigations unit does not routinely investigate some of the most deadly attacks is providing pressure and we held an emergency debate in Parliament a few weeks ago and we intend to continue the pressure so that the government agrees that actually the current situation is untenable but it requires an enormous amount of pressure and we are winning conservatives over because even they are seeing that what is happening and what the Saudis are doing is dreadfully immoral mr. Algie worry we don't have a whole lot of time left I'd like you to please keep this answer short what does it mean that the Houthis have freed two sons of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh is this some sort of an overture toward the coalition to try to break the deadlock well somehow there is some something you know obviously we cannot follow we don't know why because supposed to go directly not directly to to Jordan so there is something you know behind us we don't know exactly it was ideal for that but we hope it is and positive point in a state of negative point okay mr. bin Shem see last question here for you I'm curious about the fact that there is so much criticism within by members of us as Congress and also within UK's Parliament of the fact that weapons are still getting sold to Saudi Arabia and the UAE do you foresee a point by which there is enough pressure in in these legislative bodies by which arms would stop being sold to Saudi Arabia and the UAE or do you think this is just going to continue well it's difficult to identify a specific turning point what I know is that the pressure needs to continue and that there's a growing movement for arms embargo against Saudi Arabia I mean the European Parliament buttery Beluga a resolution calling for a you arms embargo against Saudi in France there's a legal brief that says that there's a high risk that Frances continued sales to Saudi Arabia are contrary or might be contrary to international commitments in the UK we discussed that the fact there's a legal challenge and it's continuing in Germany you know there's a coalition agreement that states that arms export will not be authorized two countries are you know as long as there will be as low as that directly involved in the Yemen war so that there's a building pressure and it's a continuing process we only hope that by the end of uncovering more violations and more war crimes the awareness will grow and then we'll get to a point where it won't be possible to carry on selling weapons to commit war crimes anymore mr. Fincham see a wheel in about 30 seconds left very quickly how will this criticism of the coalition affect efforts to revive stalled talks to end the war from your vantage point I'm sorry so criticism of the coalition that's been mounting will this affect efforts to revive stalled talks in the war do you think the talks will come about again honestly we're not into that kind of analysis what we do in human rights watch and other human rights organization is just a monitoring situation and the ground on the ground and make sure that civilians are safe and that the laws of war I respect it of course we hope for a positive outcome and we vote for negotiations to continue but that's not our role to say that you should go in this of that direction our role is to emphasize the need to respect international humanitarian law in all cases and to ring an alarm bell when so many civilians our sensors will kill alright well we've run out of time so thanks to all our guests Ahmed bin Shem C amantadine al Djibouti and Lloyd Russell moil and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com and for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ Inside Story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me Mohammed Jim Jewell and the whole team here bye for now you
