00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,950

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,599
National Health Service was formed as a

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,519
political and cultural reaction to the

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">depression</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 30s and the devastation of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Second World War at that time there</font>

10
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,490
was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> collective feeling understandably</font>

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,350
that good health should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something</font>

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,880
that everybody had a right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,350
the cool stuff like love and belonging

20
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,190
there's some pretty basic things that

21
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be addressed at the bottom sleep</font>

doesn't have the right health insurance
