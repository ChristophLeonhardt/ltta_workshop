former longtime US congressman Ron Paul mr. Paul thank you for taking the time to speak to us this hour do you think there's still a way for the situation in ad-lib to be resolved peacefully well there certainly is that doesn't mean that I think it's going to happen but you know if people would just act wisely they this could be ended because there's no reason it can't be but but to expect the West the United States to back down and and I don't think it's going to happen and I think there the pressure is so great on the people who want to confront Russia it's all designs you know to to satisfy Iran and to go after to go after Iran is an anti Iranian subject so no there could be but there would have to be an agreement and the people could leave there the and the people who had weapons they just couldn't take their weapons so it could be devised at both sides decided hey no look we don't want all this fighting and killing it's not going to serve any purpose which it won't you could you could just say well let let the people who want to leave leave and but then they would have to accept the position that it live is part of Syria which is what I think would be the proper position to hold just a year ago the American special envoy for the anti-isil coalition Brett McGurk referred to it Lib as the biggest al Qaeda haven since 9/11 we can have a listen together to that look every province is the largest al Qaeda safe haven since 9/11 and it Lib now is a huge problem it is an al Qaeda safe haven right on the border of Turkey well Washington's rhetoric regarding Italy does seem to have changed since then why do you think that is well I think since that report maybe the our position hasn't changed too much but the evidence is out that we are playing too many games with al-qaeda because we've used al-qaeda as the excuse for being there and yet I don't believe that is the case I think we're there for other reasons and al-qaeda is it's a haven there and we're on their side I mean the pragmatic reason for this is that we think al-qaeda will help our position the United States position to to get rid of Assad and this is a bipartisan Republican and Democratic position it's the only individuals like ourselves in the Institute for peace and prosperity that are arguing this is totally unnecessary it's not the right position it isn't what United States should be doing it's not part of our Constitution and yet it drives us to align ourselves with al Qaeda so the fact that they admitted it was it was more of an alert to those individuals that they had to overcome that image because we're supposed to be over there fighting them but this isn't the first time that the evidence is very clear that we have aligned ourselves with al Qaeda when we think it's temporarily a benefit to our foreign policy one of the solutions proposed by the UN Special Envoy just looking through it here was to move the terrorists from Italy to other areas does that sound like a reasonable solution to you well if you had a miracle maker maybe it would be you could but I wouldn't think that's going to work is not going to work because you'd have to they're not going to walk away you know and you'd have to remove them by force and that means there would be a conflict so no that's not going to be a solution I am concerned about the chance to offer civilians who aren't engaged in this who aren't necessarily part of al Qaeda we just like to be left alone and not engaged in this war if they themselves wanted to leave I would think that it could be worked out but right now I don't think the motives are strong enough to allow that to happen on both sides neither one once that didn't happen but to think that the terrorists are going to automatically be removed if you're going to remove them that would mean force it wouldn't work as this situation is developing in Italy we are hearing threats and warnings coming from Washington towards the the Syrian government is not going to help in any way no it makes everything worse because you know that's our policy we are threatening people too often we're putting if we if people don't do what we want and obey us and we put sanctions on them and to me that's a that is the same as a war effort when you do this so no I think the threats are terrible I think the sanctions are terrible just on principle but if our government and our people have decided that we were going to go to war there was a declaration of war you know blockades and things and disrupting trade that's part of us that you know that's a good idea strategically but to just to throw our weight around and put on these sanctions and threaten people because we are powerful we have a lot of wealth and we have the reserve currency of the world and and and we have the economic clout to put on sanctions which i think is a detriment to us and i think that we shouldn't do that and long term is going to be detrimental to United States because it's very costly and it's undermining our alliances with with anybody that we want to work with because people are getting tired of us throwing our weight around and putting on sanctions and believing that everybody has to do exactly as we say but the position for our Institute is we already you know come home and mine our own business and and try to set a good example for the world rather than thinking that we own the world because many of us believe that what we're doing is trying to maintain a modern day empire and that requires a lot of force and causes requires a lot of lying to to miss misinformed people in order for the American people to go along with that but I don't think the American people are well informed on this issue and that's why they tolerate it and when they finally wake up sometime it's a little late so well I'm trying to do with our Institute is to alert people to the danger that is involved with our foreign policy just on a related topic what strategy in Syria do you think would be in the US national interest therefore well I think the most important thing would be with something that Trump said do you know a few months ago he evidently didn't really believe it because it didn't last too long and he changed his mind and that is it's time we left Syria you know we need to get out of Syria our interests are not served by being there so I would have never gone in in the military sense and I would leave as soon as possible and I think that is is the position that we should have but the president has changes to now matter of fact he's accelerating the interference but I think this has a lot to do with making sure that we're on the side who will remain very anti Iran and that puts us into a situation where we have to be anti Russia to and to me that is very dangerous you
