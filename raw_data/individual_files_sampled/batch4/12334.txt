so you're 16 right sorry mother dies and you were lost you have to deal with whoever you have to deal with my dad your dad was mi a so you're in this impossible situation yeah the government makes it worse yeah yeah so I for the first year I was 16 and for the first year I bounced around to friends and I was an exchange student at the time so I was living in Belgium so I just finished my exchange year cuz I had nowhere else to go so I came back and I had nowhere to live because the person who was supposed to be my guardian decided not to be my guardian which was a pretty jerky thing to do yeah not a good time for that to happen 16 you just lost your mother yeah so my fairly evil aunt who I had heard nothing but awful things for my mother offered me her couch in New York City on the Lower East Side and I was like yeah I'm desperate and so she said you know I I won't touch any of the money that I'm getting from Social Security or child support from your dad and and that will be yours at the end of it cuz I had very little inheritance and the day my check stopped from Social Security when I graduated high school I was kicked out on the front steps of the Lower East Side with I like still gives me panic when I have like low battery on my phone oh I forgot to charge it crack because I had no battery I'm wearing a charger yeah and I had I didn't have a charger with me I had like two bars I was under 10% my garbage bags and I was just on the streets of New York City and I went to Social Security and I told them the whole story and that's it and they said yeah she actually that was fraud what she did was fraud and there was like other parts of this story also that that made it more fraudulent and I said okay let's let's do it thank you government yeah and so they said we'll assign an investigator and we'll get it back and I said great thank you I'm gonna guess you're still waiting for that investigator to show so he knocked on her door twice and then the investigation had to close people don't know this if your parent dies in you're under 18 Social Security ministration does send a check for a little while used to be until you were 21 now I get to tell you school graduation high school graduation and I mean I was lucky my my family didn't didn't steal my money from either very good about it but the check doesn't go to you the check goes to somebody else and if you're in a terrible situation like that there it goes yeah and then your mother like my mother paid into Social Security all her entire life and she worked from 16 years old in jail yeah and my mom worked hot like very hard my mom was an incredible person I'm sure yours was also but nothing anyway and now the federal government has that money there's no return on that you get no return so you're desperate you're basically homeless yeah at 17 18 at that point 18 cause you've graduated from high school yeah and you have a political transformation basically I so I my freshman year of college I went and I lived in the South Bronx cuz it was all I could afford and my mom being wily and smart convinced my not so wily and smart father that when they divorced he would have to pay child support she gave him a choice either I don't know 15% until she graduates high school or 10% until she graduates whatever school that she's done and so he was like I'm gonna pick the lower number not realizing that that's actually going to be more over the course of time and you're on the hook for longer gets a little puzzle when it's you're just doing you and yeah whatever I'm not gonna so any muzie so he was on the hook to still pay me child support when I was in college and so I found an apartment in a roach infested apartment first floor level in the Bronx and it was exactly his child support payment so he just paid my rent instead of child support and and I worked full-time to pay my bills and I often didn't make my bills I walk around with a dollar and in my wallet five foot tall Jewish girl living in the South Bronx yeah and I had to ask my very rich friends on the Upper West Side you know do you have some box of the pasta you can steal out of your parents pantry I was really profoundly broke that year like I really can't understate how broke I was and I was really idealistic and I said you know I'm gonna work in the Bronx and I'm gonna work with students and and I lived there and I met these there teachers and I heard the stories of you know on welfare my mom had a baby every two years so she could qualify for WIC and they didn't know they're there all their kids names and their teachers and this is all her joking no no every two years I remember this kid's name to this day and this was actually the stories that we're always told by the left-wing press Ronald Reagan was making it up the stories of the welfare queen and people gaming the system but you met these people person yeah and I went to the supermarket and saw people buying the junk food with their with their food stamps and then going outside and selling it like you if you live in New York City you will see these things in person and it's not
