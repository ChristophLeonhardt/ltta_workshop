00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
hi guys today I'm gonna stop talking

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">about books couple of books i've read</font>

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,589
recently it's really not been<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money</font>

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">i spent so much money on books in the</font>

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,859
u.s. like literally two hundred dollars

6
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,420
or so they bought loads and loads of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

7
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not fiction in particular because</font>

8
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,240
that's something that you just you don't

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,230
really get as much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new UK it's</font>

10
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,310
something that makes me angry quite a

11
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,619
lot and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of crazy plans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

12
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,410
have my head of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to combat</font>

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,869
that but it has to be added<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

14
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,369
of crazy plans of things that i will

15
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,650
eventually do one day very young adult

16
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,119
fiction on but there's no me something

17
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,619
else kind of related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that another</font>

18
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,719
video that i won't make maybe tomorrow

19

20
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,390
know books that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't yet i haven't</font>

21
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,190
read that money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's weird and</font>

22
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,690
what's really unnerving is fact that

23
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,600
i've read fewer books is summer then i

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,860
read in a relatively unbusy school week

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,770
and not even just in terms of like you

26
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what you think you know less is</font>

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,620
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-week i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read like lots of</font>

28
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,180
thin books or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and that's why</font>

29
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm saying that note like I read you</font>

30
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,649
know subjects of whom you'd like four or

31
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,690
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> six hundred page books in a week</font>

32
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,420
and I'm at school just because I sort of

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,070
devour them have you been finishing

34
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,170
death it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy you think that a book</font>

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,000
that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for a few years</font>

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,010
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> pencil through but it's not the</font>

37
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">same it's lovely so far i'm on the 380</font>

38
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,369
first page<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the good thing i love</font>

39
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,799
about cornelia funke it's the ways to

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,869
use his language and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

41
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,299
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost her writing and and it's</font>

42
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,220
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so if i was it's my favorite</font>

43
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,990
ink cart will probably always be in my

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,729
favorite but i haven't gotten to the end

45
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,240
here and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am really kind of reveling in</font>

46
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,000
in like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> her use of language and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a setting and the situation and the</font>

48
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,840
ideas that you come up with this so

49
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,329
complex even even though I have to say

50
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,950
zone for characters aren't my favorite

51
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,049
fictional characters certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in</font>

52
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,210
fantasy but now am I am enjoying it so

53
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,500
far i'll give you a bit more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">update about that later but it's not</font>

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,719
book I mean I preferment in cut but when

56
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,360
in the bookshop I work out to some 11 12

57
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,770
year olds if they're quite capable

58
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,259
readers or maybe 10 year old if their

59
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,899
parents of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but this I wouldn't</font>

60
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,780
recommend anyone under 14 because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

61
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,030
quite a read another book that I read or

62
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,200
just something I went to the library and

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I kind of passed it and got out is that</font>

64
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,180
calling the shots in my parents

65
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,220
directing the new series of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor here</font>

66
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,849
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Graham Harper with Adrian Rickles but</font>

67
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,410
and here's a director of Doctor Who I

68
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,780
expect too much of books sometimes even

69
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,400
one that like you only look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

70
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,989
and the photos the back have clearly

71
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,390
been like googled and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck on the back</font>

72
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,910
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I accept as well then it's</font>

73
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,080
you know supposed to be interesting for

74
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,250
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in directing</font>

75
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,700
but just is not written very well at all

76
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,680
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they even even though his director</font>

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,200
he's not a writer so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is he watching</font>

78
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,780
back you know yeah they're all common

79
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,099
sense of furniture but they're more like

80
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,519
because there were facts about like the

81
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,500
actors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of dr. which I</font>

82
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,750
love rather than about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the techniques</font>

83
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,260
and about the way he sees his ideas

84
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,030
develop a monster it just it was really

85
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,980
bitty and I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could have</font>

86
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">just SAT there taking the time to kind</font>

87
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,819
of organize this material rather than

88
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,500
rushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out before the next rows of</font>

89
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">dr. he was over so kind of bit pissed</font>

90
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,659
about that one star on Goodreads not

91
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,489

this book which I'm sure a lot of you

101
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,599
Brendan chicken soup for the teenage

102
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,269
soul in my pants it's a book that I

103
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:44,450
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the stories i love about</font>

104
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,400
fifty percent of them and when I feel

105
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,599
completely loved ish book that I used to

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,700
read this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will likely read one my</font>

107
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,819
favorite fiction book book for something

108
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,099
less fictional<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read that but one thing</font>

109
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,780
I didn't like about it was the editing I

110
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,689
mean I didn't that feel like it was

111
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">honestly the voice of teenagers I didn't</font>

112
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,260
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it was decimated almost been</font>

113
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,209
sanitized a way to kind of get rid of

114
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,530
bit of that honesty but it's still

115
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,150
amazing bike it's so like chicken ziti

116
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">no shells awesome what I loved about</font>

117
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,680
read their editor mentioned it

118
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,880
direction we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tell that</font>

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,520
there wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of sanitization</font>

120
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,060
process it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was honest and I put this in</font>

121
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,919
my business in a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things if</font>

122
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,720
it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my Goodreads review but it's in</font>

123
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter and I yeah i'm on twitter i got</font>

124
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,669

you will be really addicted and you wake

126
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,600
up for us anymore you really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

127
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,919
update my<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter or maybe that's just</font>

me maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just obsessed like that</font>

129
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,830
but what I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> on twitter is that like</font>

130
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,449
you know what you'd go one minute and

131
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:47,800
I'd be like laughing out loud it

132
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,539
something i read or just little smiling

133
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,940
or closing is quite touching like Carly

134
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,979
that's a lovely story and then I'll just

135
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,710

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,419
make you feel slightly uncomfortable

139
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,550
because they're so honest but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

140
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,009
think you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it you're flat</font>

141
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,050

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all political philosophy which</font>

156
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">is kind of interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm</font>

157
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,030
having sort like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crisis of faith but</font>

158
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,099
it's a crisis of political<font color="#E5E5E5"> stats I</font>

159
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,050
genuinely would describe yourself as

160
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,419
quite liberal and thinking but the more

161
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think about like the ideology behind</font>

162

it all there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff that i</font>

all day was a lot of socialism don't at

165
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,539
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> grid would pretty much the majority</font>

166
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,169
of conservatism I don't know if it's

167
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,360
because I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that she was going</font>

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,970
to be McCain's running mate in the

169
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,610
United States elections in November at a

170
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,860
point where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't in the best mood or</font>

171
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,759
just because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't stand her oh</font>

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,769
it's the same Sarah Palin

173
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:32,319
frankly I'm insulted and I'm the last

174
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,419
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> insulted you know</font>

175
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,389
the first people who should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> insulted</font>

176
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,569
are the entire female population of the

177
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,639
United States when America possibly

178
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,249
excluding pale yourself be insulted I'd

179
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,019

suggestion anyone who voted for Hillary

181
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:53,739
Clinton or supported her or batch out

182
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:56,409
should immediately back Sarah Palin for

183
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,999
the simple matter it's she's suggesting

184
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,059
that she's female and she's shattering

185
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:04,269
