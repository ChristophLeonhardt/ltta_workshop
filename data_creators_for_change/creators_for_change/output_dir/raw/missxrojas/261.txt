00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
hi friends today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,000
the bling ring which is the film by

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Sofia Coppola that I saw last night with

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,240
my friends in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last video everything</font>

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,099
Wing week I'm using it as a fan because

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,450
the UK is hot hot hot hot hot hot<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,309
now loving it though as much with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom</font>

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,150
just made for<font color="#CCCCCC"> LA living in the tradition</font>

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,650
of film reviews on those channels gonna

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,750
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> place on my brown sofa with the</font>

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,539
help of a few things you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm</font>

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,429
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of yeah like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,960
the things they care my first

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">impressions I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sort of</font>

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,710
film if you're not a fan of Sofia

18
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,899
Coppola you probably weren't like one

19
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,640
thing that's huge in this film and it's

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,410
a figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's other films of silence</font>

21
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,090
and this is certainly something that she

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,879
uses to thought the max degree in this

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,770
film like the sound mixing at times is

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,480
also quite weird likes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dialogue</font>

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,770
is very quiet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if it was</font>

26
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,149
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Odeon cinema but the</font>

27
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,440
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the dialogue and</font>

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,850
the music as well was a little bit weird

29
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,949
it was a koala I like the way she plays

30
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,570
the sound I think it works really well I

31
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,980
do you think the stylist my favor well

32
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,239
some people sometimes it doesn't

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,620
overwhelm the film I feel like it

34
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,539
overwhelm somewhere in a way that it

35
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,339
didn't overwhelm for example the virgin

36
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,140
suicides and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

37
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,210
the cars I absolutely love<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katie Chang</font>

38
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm really obsessed with an hour</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but she</font>

39
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,720
pays a ritual leave the favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> chili I</font>

40
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,100
know Rebecca I think your name was

41
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,810
you're just so good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> being so together</font>

42
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">and cool and gathered and calm and while</font>

43
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,070
I do think it's necessary for fictional

44
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,950
film to have realism in them my do you

45
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,450
think was very much like girls you'll

46
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,220
see at school<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're like how did it do</font>

47
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,140
that how are they so like chilled out

48
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,299
like everything sort of unfeasible

49
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,040
people the Chloe character was a lot of

50
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun and she had an amazing hand in this</font>

51
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,750
guy big mark he was the Nick Prugo

52
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,409
doppelganger I know you did a really

53
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,060
good job of his world but I thought his

54
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,850
role was designed to make us feel

55
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,439
sympathetic towards him which I didn't

56
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,610
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel at all I don't really</font>

57
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand why we're supposed to bring</font>

58
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,270
the girls more than the guy i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't find</font>

59
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,220
his excuses compelling<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't find his</font>

60
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,430
whole position to the media compelling<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

61
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,470
just saw I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like him at all</font>

62
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,479
and then there's an Wattson of Nikki now

63
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,399
all the sort of scenes of her family

64
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are so many of them that were</font>

65
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,189
pulled from pretty wild and they're so

66
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,880
funny and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

67
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Isana who's the only other person in our</font>

68
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> who'd seen it everyone else in</font>

69
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,440
cinema was like laughing at how

70
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">ridiculous this guy was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being not</font>

71
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,190
knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something that she</font>

72
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually said once in terms of the film</font>

73
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,459
itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had locked the trademarks of</font>

74
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,110
like bright colors<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they said before</font>

75
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,840
silences but then also like very popular

76
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,730
music as well very strong soundtrack

77
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,530
nothing stronger of course than a crown

78
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,120
on the ground west labels which really

79
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,620
set the tone for the film for the

80
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,480
montages of real interviews with all

81
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,920
these celebrities and that sort of

82
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,319
grainy pixelated format as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

83
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">oftentimes you see and these videos</font>

84
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,180
reproduced online as that was really

85
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,860
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me because they didn't</font>

86
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,660
pretend that they were these higher

87
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,580
quality videos you know which for me at

88
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,690
least really push<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

89
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">videos being pulled from the internet</font>

90
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,750
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet itself being the site</font>

91
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,720
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> crimes and the sight of that</font>

92
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,030
inception<font color="#CCCCCC"> but also the site of judgment</font>

93
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,560
for them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in between at the side of</font>

94
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,390
their documentation through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook and</font>

95
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">through selfies and through all of that</font>

96
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,959
another thing that was huge to me that

97
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,280
hadn't really gathered from reading

98
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,870
about the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> and was just really might</font>

99
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,849
not see Joe's articles or other articles

100
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,739
around the case as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I almost the</font>

101
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,650
idea of these houses being museums to

102
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,870
these people in museums you could really

103
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">delve into each object within the museum</font>

104
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a museum itself and it had like</font>

105
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">photographed history of where it had</font>

106
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,319
been warning and the event it was

107
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,269
associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with especially with things</font>

108
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,400
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Lindsay Lohan and her trials and</font>

109
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,380
whatever one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> arms and museums to</font>

110
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,389
ourselves things that we kind of curate

111
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,950
in association with other people

112
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,380
sometimes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainly ones that we decide</font>

113
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,900
what goes where and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in charge of</font>

114
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,150
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> once your inaudible or you live</font>

115
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,980
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house but these houses</font>

116
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,269
with museums on a completely different

117
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,579
scale because the space like the

118
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,040
physical space of it in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the</font>

119
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,630
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone has in the house</font>

120
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,310
and just take it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another level do a</font>

121
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of photographs you might have</font>

122
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,280
yourself and pictures with friends

123
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,769
become Paris Hilton's cushion or even

124
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,359
the job or a photograph to don't want

125
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,250
anyone else to see becoming locked up in

126
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,470
this huge safe of jewels the image being

127
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,970
created through the space in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which you</font>

128
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,639
live and this face which you present to

129
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,989
the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you invite into your</font>

130
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,700
home for them of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> bling ring</font>

131
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,989
burglaries you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all these people</font>

132
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,880
like invading

133
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,620
Museum of yourself and invading your

134
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,080
image partly because in doing so they're

135
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,839
sort of capturing so when Rebecca /

136
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,880
rachel lee takes up from orlando<font color="#CCCCCC"> bloom's</font>

as with all these other teenagers

142
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,620
becomes an amalgamation of everything of

143
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,900
everyone else and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that</font>

144
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,300
really speaks to her and her<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

145
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,640
her experience with media especially so

146
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,170
I really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like we watch the whole</font>

147
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,150
thing from a museum of vacation

148

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,160
story about like looting yeah I don't

<font color="#E5E5E5">know response to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the looting and how we</font>

155
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,550
thought like obviously in when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

156

in the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye and was like all the</font>

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,920
responses they were looting faceless

161
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,960
organizations that could afford it yeah

162
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways like Paris Hilton to</font>

163
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,590
those people was a faceless organization

164
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,110
that could afford it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I like to</font>

165
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,520
us like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the images of her face</font>

167
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,240
but Sir present I was kind of joking

168
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,310
about that with idea what would these

169
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,590
places being museums and then robbing it

170
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,140
to make their museums of their room yeah

171
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,960
like I'm at the beach a lot so she

172
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,460
curated yeah what she<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew of the world</font>

173
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,260
and then they were just curating from

174
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,780
what she curated and we're under<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

175
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">you compare it to that idea of like</font>

176
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,160
faceless corporations because there's

177
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,230
that idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like celebrities become</font>

178
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,000
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much more about branding than</font>

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,010
it ever has before we feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I as you</font>

shoot this as well yeah honest and they

181
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,970

182
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">main character so watch la go and play</font>

194
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,300
social but like for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's quite</font>

195
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,090
socially acceptable like right yeah

196
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,310
