Russia's envoy to the United Nations Vasily no Ben Xia has condemned what he called acts of aggression in Syria he was speaking at a UN Security Council session on the long-running humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country well we can now cross live to our correspondent Samira Khan in Washington for more on this so Samira I mean could you tell us what was actually said at the Security Council meeting well tensions escalated between Russia and the u.s. at today's Security Council meeting now Russia called for this emergency Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Raqqa city that was until recently Isis territory but now under full US control and in addition to Raqqa they were set to discuss a refugee camp on the Syria Jordan border but instead the two traded insults and accusations with Russia saying that the u.s. hasn't done enough to solve the crisis in areas under US control to which the US responded first denying the allegation then accusing Russia of trying to distract the world from quote Assad's atrocities the focus then shifted to a recent events is in the coalition's airstrikes last week which the Russian ambassador condemned and then demanded that Western countries stop their aggression let's check out what happened with direct aggression the u.s. the UK and France expressed the solidarity with one side of the conflict an aggressor has no moral right to say he's preparing a legal framework that protects operations have succeeded in rolling back the so-called Isis Caliphate and addressing a dire threat to our collective peace and security the Coalition made these gains while the Assad regime and its backers focus their guns mostly on the Syrian opposition groups that weren't Isis terrorists now then Russia said that the coalition's airstrike discouraged Syria from participating in peace talk the Russian ambassador ended reiterating that there is no military solution to the conflict here's more of what happened between - yes there's other just a toaster bub if the goal is to use bombs to force the Syrian President to negotiate and then presented as a victor of him and put him in court as war criminal then this is an impossible goal Russia has called us here as part of a messaging campaign to try to distract from the atrocities committed by the Assad regime in order to do that Russia has asked this council to focus its attention on the one part of Syria where the Assad regime isn't pummeling civilians to death with barrel bombs or banned chemical weapons things are heating up between the two countries so we'll just have to wait and see what happens and most importantly how this will impact Syria and indeed Rachelle's American in Washington many thanks
