what do you make of that attack ad linking Doug Ford to Mike Harris and Stephen Harper do you think it's gonna work well for starters it's dishonest because the numbers they cite are totally made-up there were no cuts to health care under under Stephen Harper in fact he contributed that the there was 6% a year growth which is massive growth about triple inflation to healthcare every single year he was in power federally so it's a lie and why you know we always hear about fake news these days and so on why are these groups allowed to just bold-faced lie with numbers like that now whether it'll work or not obviously there's people out there that don't know the facts they also don't know who this group is they probably they probably believe they're working Ontario women when they're really a bunch of public sector unions who like to want to continue to dine out on our dime and they're very very worried you know that a government that's bent over backwards to accommodate unions at the expense of 80 percent of us that don't work for unions you know that they got to be really worried about that one thing I think though Ezra is this is now about the fifth election in Ontario and of course it's happened in other in other provinces and federally - but this is about the fifth one in Ontario where the unions have spent a lot of dough and most of their members - or at least a lot of their members don't like the fact their dues are getting used by this but anyway I guess that's another topic but I would think there's an awful lot of people that have their number now when this first started happening a lot of people me included some who are these guys you know like and this wo W group is new right they've only been around to my knowledge maybe it may be a year max but working families of course has been around quite a long time yeah and you never hear a peep out of them except around elections when they want Liberals elected so yeah I would hope most people have got their number now know that they spoke balderdash which they do and there or are not going to be duped by this kind of garbage that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
