20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,629
before showing you an example of the

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,399
game you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ensure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got</font>

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,930
the right materials you'll need to

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,059
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a camera now it can be</font>

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,489
as basic as a web camera whatever you

25
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,619
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use will be fine you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">need someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with no not like</font>

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,040
that it's an innocent<font color="#CCCCCC"> game for innocent</font>

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,670
people no more women is a fast-paced

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,040
game so it's important that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we time it</font>

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,229
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> player has three minutes and if you</font>

31
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,930
run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time you lose to ensure both</font>

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,490
players have there in three minutes to

33
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,710
battle with I highly recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font>

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,630
chess clock<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've pasted some links in</font>

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,400
the description of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this video and</font>

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,979
finally you'll need the internet and if

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,210
you're watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> me without the internet</font>

38
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,400
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now then what the is going on</font>

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,350
so the game starts would be deciding

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,750
which player is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first toss</font>

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,759
of a coin sounds good to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it</font>

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,490
begins the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first player chooses the name</font>

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,770
of someone and then a category that they

44
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,100
belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Andre Agassi no more</font>

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,890
people whose first and second name last

46
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,420
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> can begin with the same letter in</font>

47
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case a yeah ah ok ah it is then the</font>

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,540
next person's turn and they must<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

49
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,790
someone who does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> belong in the</font>

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,950
category that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been stated</font>

51
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,560
tennis legend

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">tim henman yeah no more tennis people</font>

53
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the category list will continue to grow</font>

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,300
and grow and your options of names<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,069
choose will become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more narrow</font>

56
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,230
my whole list of names has been drained

57
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,180
our completely when it comes to choosing

58
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,760
names they must be someone well-known or

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,540
famous mr blobby no more fictional

60
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,910
characters speaking interesting facts

61
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,069
about your nominated person is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

62
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,620
welcome but be careful don't waste too

63
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,239
much of your time in ol Edmonds was

64
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,610
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. blobby ok and because once</font>

65
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,260
he took up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hat and it was in fact no</font>

66
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,989
so I'm gonna go Noel Edmonds no more

67
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,660
quiz show hosts now if your opponent

68
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,700
breaks a rule you can challenge them

69
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,860
Jeremy Kyle no more typical show if you

70
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,989
conclude the challenge was wrong he said

71
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,360
quiz show though yeah yeah and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

72
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,610
know I guess they are quizzing on a

73
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,110
paternity test<font color="#CCCCCC"> map the game continues ok</font>

74
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh no more TV personalities the</font>

75
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,900
categories you choose in this game can

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,959
be about absolutely anything so be

77
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,739
creative or boring Albert Einstein no

78
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,230
more dead the science lives on

79
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,640
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't oh and here's a</font>

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,510
tip if I'm you break a rule in the game

81
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,010
just be really really subtle about it

82
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,799
because your opponent might not notice

83
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,510
and therefore not made a challenge now

84
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">during the game there will be many</font>

85
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,930
moments in which you might want to offer

86
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,620
support to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> opponent and in some</font>

87
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,930
cases you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask for support</font>

88
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,840
from your opponent who wrote Harry

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,980
Potter<font color="#CCCCCC"> is unknown can help but it just</font>

90
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,480
means you're weak they play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

91
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,410
JK Rowling so yeah JK rounded ah no more

92
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,760
women she's quite finished

93
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,080
cheers for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it'd be a bit heavy in a</font>

94
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,240
relationship with<font color="#E5E5E5"> her true so just all</font>

95
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">wizards all day with this is my time um</font>

96
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,880
it sure is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you break a rule in</font>

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,490
the game you can only be challenged once

98
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,488
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> set a category so if you manage</font>

99
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,738
to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself in time you're safe</font>

100
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,030
myleene klass oh no more women oh i was

101
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">so close to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge AAA husk you are</font>

102
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,850
hot and what doing now there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

103
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,950
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of winning the game the first is if</font>

104
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,490
your opponent runs out of time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

105
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,010
second way is if you make a challenge on

106
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">your opponent and it's correct Vernon</font>

107
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:48,920
Kay no more people with<font color="#CCCCCC"> northern accents</font>

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,430
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to challenge you do you know why</font>

109
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,000
why Vernon Kay hosts family fortunes

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,630
which is a quiz oh come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on he's not the</font>

111
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">real family fortunes host as Les Dennis</font>

112
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,120
and so those are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rules of no more</font>

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,630
women and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember be a good school</font>

114
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:15,820
