will take too long then one of us go of
it look we've got no idea who's out
there
okay I'm gonna sneak across make sure
it's clear before we bring the whole
group over oh I think splitting up the
group is a good idea maybe I never said
it was a good idea but it's better than
risk and everyone at once true Clemence
I can scoot across low and slow make
sure nobody's waiting for us on the
other side good I don't tough time

assure you yeah I did me and Cassie
Lausanne but I'll tell you a secret
it's not people are more political now
than they ever were before in the end we
can't change the world we can't change
the one can do is continue to learn from
each other
hell yeah thighs and empathize heads and
use our heads
what a great Whore is a symptom of man's
failures and thinking Adam Wow
have you read him Constanta half well we
have plenty of time to catch you up on
your reading my partner Matthew is
amassing quite the literature collection
I think you'll like him
oh it is as long as we have our wits
about us we can always make the right
choice
right right right what a small man I
feel like that's foreshadowing
what's the matter Clementine Oh is there
something you want to tell me is that oh
