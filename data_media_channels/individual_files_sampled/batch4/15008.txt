in the Department of waving the white flag of moral surrender it is now officially okay to cheat at monopoly well from the fake 1980 Boston Marathon winner Rosie Ruiz to flim-flam man Bernie Madoff it said that nobody likes a cheat but is that really the case case in point this fall Hasbro will be releasing a new Monopoly game called the cheaters edition seriously that's the actual name the cheaters edition it will feature new rules and gameplay elements in which players are actually encouraged to actively cheat and in addition to the usual Community Chest and chance cards there are 15 different cheat cards cheat strategies include stealing from the bank skimping on rent adding a hotel you didn't buy to your property removing someone else's hotel from their property and collecting rent from someone else's property I used to think that monopoly was a celebration of capitalism but these rules seem to be channeling Marxism and wealth redistribution maybe has roads should have called this version of Monopoly the Venezuelan edition but here's the rub perhaps there's some measure of satisfaction in winning any game via cheating but isn't such an achievement really a hollow victory winning by cheating is surely nothing to openly celebrate which is why baseball's Hall of Fame remains closed of those players who are known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs and I think an iconic mass-produced and mass-marketed board game that celebrates cheating as opposed to condemning it moves that proverbial moral compass ever so slightly yet again after all what is the inherent message here can't write that midterm essay that'll garner an A+ hey no worries there are people who will do the word smithing for you for a fee of course you'll get that coveted grade assuming you aren't exposed as a fraud but really what did you actually learn by getting others to do the heavy lifting for you sorry Hasbro this edition of Monopoly sends the wrong message especially to those in society who already feel entitled I hope it's dead on arrival when it hits the retail chain and by the way if anyone steals a cheaters version of Monopoly from a store do they get a free pass wouldn't that be the ultimate cheat after all or maybe that sort of cheating isn't all that jolly for those who have skin in the game when it comes to making a living selling board games as for the genius who came up with the cheaters edition of Monopoly please go directly to jail to not pass go do not collect $200 for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like that rat please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
