alright first off I want to say when I figured out that the guy on the daily wire who has one of the best podcasts also wrote the home Landers series and the last thing I remember my mind is blown oh that's nice to hear but yeah my question kind of has to do with that most of the books I've read of yours are deal with fiction and I was wondering if an into any challenges while writing guys now with the fact that it's based on such a dark and messed up you know subject material and the fact that it actually happened in real life yes and it was it was a genuine oh man it was a genuine chore you know you know Michael Ramirez these a he's a right-wing cartoonist he's won the Pulitzer Prize he heard I was doing this and he sent me as a gift of print of his cartoon of Gosnell victims these babies in basically in a concentration camp in a death camp and I hung it over my desk and every day I just felt the weight of those children on my shoulders and I thought like there's this special place in hell for if I could do this right you know and the the task that I think we all wanted to have not just me but everybody is we wanted to tell the story without making it so you couldn't watch because it is it's horrific it's a horror story and yet we wanted people to be able to come it's not a preachy story it's not a story a saying you know no abortion this is bad it's a story about the fact that this guy was the most prolific serial killer in American history and nobody would cover the story why is that why it was because he was an abortionist they wanted to protect abortion and they people told us that you know so that was the story I wanted to tell which is not a you know story the guy with a knife I'm plunging into children you know and and and yet you had to stick to the facts you know you had to stick to the story and I just wanted so desperately to get it right I was happy with the way the script turned out screenwriters as you may know have no power you know they they hand in their script and they go away and they can shoot whatever they want and so I hope it turned out well I have a lot of faith in Nick and I think it probably did
