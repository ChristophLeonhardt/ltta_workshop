DEAR FRIENDS, WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY. REMEMBER THIS MOMENT! THIS IS HISTORY. PRESIDENT TRUMP, BY RECOGNIZING HISTORY, YOU HAVE MADE HISTORY. ALL OF US ARE DEEPLY MOVED, ALL OF US ARE DEEPLY GRATEFUL, FOR ME BEING HERE BRINGS BACK WONDERFUL MEMORIES FROM MY CHILDHOOD. SO I NOW SOME OF YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW EVERY WORD I SAID IN HEBREW AND I'LL TELL YOU I SPENT THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF ANY LIFE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND IN GETTY STREET, WHICH IS NOT VERY FAR AWAY. THERE WERE A FEW CHARMING HOUSES HERE. MANY OPEN FIELDS. I REMEMBER WALKING IN THESE FIELDS WITH MY BROTHER. HE WAS SIX. I WAS THREE. HE HELD MY HAND VERY TIGHT. WE WOULD WALK TO THIS WONDROUS HOUSE, OF A PROFESSOR, THE RENOWNED JEWISH HISTORIAN. HE WAS MY FATHER'S TEACHER. I USED TO PEER THROUGH THE SLATS OF THE WOODEN SYNAGOGUE WHERE HE AND THE GREAT ISRAELI WRITER USED THE PRAY ON SHABBAT. AND DAVID, I WOULD APPROACH THIS PLACE RIGHT HERE, BUT ONLY SO FAR. BECAUSE MY MOTHER TOLD ME YOU CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER. THIS WAS NEAR THE BORDER. IT WAS EXPOSED TO SNIPER FIRE. THAT WAS THEN. THIS IS NOW. TODAY TODAY THE MOST THE EMBASSY OF THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH. OUR GREATEST ALLY, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. TODAY ITS EMBASSY OPENS HERE!
