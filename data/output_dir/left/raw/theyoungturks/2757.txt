<font color="#E5E5E5">Forbes might know but she didn't name</font>

139
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,700
those names and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get into</font>

140
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but she says no we definitely told</font>

141
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,130
people he definitely did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and she said</font>

142
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,599
here's another quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cramer did</font>

143
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,570
what Eliza said<font color="#E5E5E5"> he did he is a this is</font>

again from<font color="#E5E5E5"> sue booth Forbes he's a</font>

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,440
pedophile<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he must face the</font>

146
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,930
consequences<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's the actress</font>

147
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,710
friend she told her mom<font color="#CCCCCC"> sue booth Forbes</font>

148
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">and according</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Forbes other people on</font>

149
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,150
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Senate older brother as well and</font>

150
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,570
that was all not<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently but 25</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

151
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,110
ago

152
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,599
okay and the accident<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she had on</font>

153
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,220
the set of the day that they confronted

154
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cramer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the records she was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken</font>

155
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,669
in the hospital there's no question

156
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:24,270
about that

157
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,430
now nobody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

158
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,099
what happened in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but why</font>

159
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,080
would a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year old girl come out and</font>

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,360
take on this powerful person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's good</font>

161
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,130
friends with the main star on the set

162
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of nowhere and insist on it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,169
but by the way

164
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:41,610
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly came forward it's not</font>

165
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">like she had an axe to grind it not it's</font>

166
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,029
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shannon agenda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway we're</font>

167
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,370
over discussing this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is seems like</font>

168
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,460
an incredibly clear case also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

169
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,370
looked she she<font color="#CCCCCC"> just came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out with with</font>

170
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,289
her allegations and I just want to

171
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,240
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> emphasize the fact that it's</font>

172
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">taken her such a long time to do it</font>

173
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> initially did come out</font>

174
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,669
she did come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to family members and</font>

175
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">they didn't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to handle it</font>

176
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it was such a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taboo topic at the</font>

177
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,779
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so think about how far we've come</font>

178
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">in all this time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know since she was</font>

179
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 but also how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's still a way to</font>

180
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because even though this me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

181
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">movement has been going on for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

182
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she still didn't feel</font>

183
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable coming forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until very</font>

184
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,039
recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's a scary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do</font>

185
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,870
it's a scary to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and talk</font>

186
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,979
about what you've gone through

187
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,479
especially when you initially told

188
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,210
people it got brushed under the rug

189
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was one part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of her statement</font>

190
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,479
where she talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how after the</font>

191
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">apartment thing they were both in a cap</font>

192
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,610
together and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had her sit on his lap</font>

193
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that the cab driver was looking at</font>

194
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:48,689
her<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they were making eye contact</font>

195
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:51,270
the entire time because<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scared</font>

196
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cab driver knew something was wrong</font>

197
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">but no one came to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her you know to her</font>

198
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,330
defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one came to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help her it's</font>

199
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">just crazy</font>

200
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">and think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the retaliation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

201
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,639
the accident<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens the day that they</font>

202
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,729
make it public at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the set and</font>

203
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,430
she's 12 years old<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

204
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,569
they might have been able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ruin her</font>

205
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,629
career<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it took a quarter of a</font>

206
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,729
century<font color="#CCCCCC"> to gather up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the courage now</font>

207
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,680
imagine how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to</font>

208
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,409
it children like her and the women<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

209
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,180
by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> two guys from people like</font>
