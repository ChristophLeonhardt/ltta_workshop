the head of CBS les Moonves is exiting the company following Ronin Pharaohs second piece on allegations that Moonves had sexually assaulted multiple women who had previously worked with him now CBS said Sunday night that Moonves and CBS will donate 20 million dollars to organizations that support the me to movement and other groups fighting for workplace equity for women and I can I just say when I saw that headline I was like okay here's my prediction he is going to get a lot more than 20 million dollars in his severance it's not like he's gonna reach into his pocket and be like oh look I found 20 million dollars out of the goodness of my heart I'm gonna give it to the me to move it yeah so so this donation will come out of his severance and of course 100 million dollar severance package 100 million dollars for leading the company for leaving the company following allegations that he sexually assaulted multiple women so imagine where you work right this is the difference between the powerful and and the rest of us where you're accused of sexually assaulting women at work and threatening to fire them these are the accusations okay and in some of the instances it is literal sexual assault that he is alleged to have done and your boss comes to you and goes I can't believe you would sexual assault your coworkers it's outrageous you're obviously fired so here's a hundred million dollars it's everything look like and now let me explain it's not like we don't get it I understand he is a CEO CBS did really well under his tenure when they call him something like Wall Street had a crush on him whatever right beloved by Wall Street he's also the person who famously said that Trump is bad for the country but great for ratings no that's right yeah yeah no they they called him quote The Wall Street hero oh okay okay but look you make this thought price rise you make you give shareholders value they give you money in return so that's the normal set of actions and and a lot of the CEOs give these huge bonuses and huge golden parachutes even when the company loses money that drives me nuts that's not how capitalism supposed to work in the les moonves's case he did make a profit for CBS so I'm giving you the full context so if he left under normal circumstances that hundred million dollars might grind your gears but he did make CBS a lot of money don't care but under these circumstances are you are you serious and of course the answer is whenever it comes to money of course they're serious he's gonna try to keep every dollar of it that he can the 20 million dollars he's giving is so that he can keep the other 80 million yeah so let me tap your trick let me be clear about something CBS has decided to launch an investigation to see if any of these allegations against Les Moonves are true and they say that the severance will depend on the outcome of the investigation so look to be fair and I want to make sure we're a hundred percent accurate in in reporting the story to you guys it has not been confirmed that he's gonna get a hundred thousand dollars 100 million I'm sorry 100 million but it looks like it is you know they're headed in that direction yeah I mean that is their intent it look it's now let's give you more context and and as to why he might not get that money so he was and why all this story might have come out in the first place and now look you kid some people might be upset at me for saying that my job is to give you context so he was in a huge fight with Shari redstone sure and so his father Sumner Redstone had bought CBS about 20 years ago they have controlling shares but and when they wanted to merge back in with CBS they had separated out the companies a little bit they still had a controlling interest but the country the companies I'm sorry although these days that's a apt Freudian slip because these companies are even more powerful than countries anyway the companies are acting as separate groups shara/road some wanted to bring them back in les moonves fought her and the CBS board went with Moonves so when now a lot of the directors have been let go they got a new board they are going to look into moonves's allegations it looks like he did do them so they'll probably find a lot of things he did do so they might come back and they're not at this point they're not friends of us they might come back and go well sad day for you les you're not getting a hundred and so that's why les Moonves is trying super hard to seem conciliatory so that he can get some piece of that hundred million dollars that's part of why he and CBS together are going yeah do me too right be too right yeah yeah 20 million sure of course we'll do that and and so what's the context of this story coming out it I don't know for a fact so it might have been just a coincidence that while they're having this massive board fight these stories come out about Les Moonves now I want to be clear I don't care that if that's the reason they came out because they appear to be true they're allegations for now okay they've got a lot of detail you could read it for yourself and Ronin Pharaohs pieces right so well if you did it less you know then and it's not like an all right attack where it's half lies and you can't tell what's true and what's not true and so sad day for you but that a lot of times when they're wrestling over a control of a company I think Harvey YC might have been a similar situation yep all of a sudden one side goes oh yeah I'm gonna go nuclear so I actually do care if that's the way this story came out now we may never know at this point you know it is speculation but if the board members decide in the middle of this conflict okay well why don't we leak the story and put it out there that's deeply problematic that means the board members we're covering up this you know this bad behavior this criminal behavior and then just used it to their advantage when it was good for them so look it's not it's on people to figure out who at CBS knew and who at the company knew and who didn't it's not our job okay but if they knew and they were just using it to you not releasing it even though they knew the problems existed but waiting to use it when it came to their financial advantage well that is using the movement in a way that is disgusting okay I was gonna say sick yeah so that's an issue and a lot of people are weaponizing the movement and and and so when you find out things like what moon dress has done it's important that he not be in that position of power anymore but understand that some people are using it for their advantage so I do want to toss to a video Ronan Farrow he was on CNN talking about his latest piece on this and he gives us a little more detail so let's take a look these are more numerous clans these are six women all of them on the record also describing more serious allegations you know this includes multiple allegations of either physically forced or coerced oral sex it includes the case that resulted in a criminal investigation and the reason Brian that these women are coming out now is that they have been extraordinarily frustrated by what they perceived to be inaction on the part of CBS and its board and that really is integral to what prompted this follow-up story there are a number of cases recently that we've seen where media companies have moved very quickly to remove and even fire for cause individuals subject to allegations of considerably less serious yes Nev so when the story first came out I thought look this looks like a pattern and if he did it two times or six times because six women had come out the first time around he probably did it 10 times 20 times 60 times so tick tick tick tick and then now we have the second shoot dropping and now it's another six women but remember for every woman that comes forward there are many who don't I talked to a woman in media recently who said look if I come forward that's what I'm known for for the rest of my life and do I really want that is that what I want to be defined by so understanding there are a lot more that that might be out there and and Ronan Pharaohs latest piece in The New Yorker talks about a pattern and it was the same pattern over and over and over again so how many times that it actually happened god knows and how many people knew about it and didn't do anything I said other really really solid question yeah and what Ronan said about the women coming forward because they felt frustrated that CBS as a company and its board wasn't taking any action that stood out to me quite a bit at the end of the day that I'm sure the bills try to certainly move us we'll try to get some of that 100 million dollars where no one's looking but sad day for them there guys like we're on a pharaoh on the beat and my guess is a lot of people will be looking to easy ways to follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down
