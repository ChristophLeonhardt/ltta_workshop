1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:01,740
SHE CROSSED THE DELAWARE ON A

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:05,177
SLICE OF TOAST.

3
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:07,212
DANA PERINO.

4
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:10,716
"THE FIVE" ."

5
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:12,151
THE WORLD IS GETTING HOTTER, AND

6
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:14,520
IT'S NOT GLOBAL WARMING.

7
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:16,722
IT'S POLITICAL TENSION DRIVEN BY

8
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:17,289
EMOTION.

9
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:22,294
IS IT?

10
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:24,930
MOST OF AMERICA ISN'T WHAT'S ON

11
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,197
TV.

12
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:26,231
THE SHOUTING ON CAMERA IS WHAT

13
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:28,700
ATTRACTS THE CAMERA IN THE FIRST

14
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,202
PLACE, SO YOU SEE MORE OF IT.

15
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:32,738
IT MAY NOT BE A BAD IDEA TO

16
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:34,540
LOWER THE TEMPERATURE.

17
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,175
WHY NOT A PEACE MOVEMENT OR AT

18
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:38,544
LEAST A "KEEP THE PEACE"

19
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:38,977
MOVEMENT.

20
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:40,746
LET'S ADMIT ONE KEY TRUTH.

21
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:41,847
ALMOST ALL PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE

22
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:44,249
WITH EACH OTHER I THINK THAT

23
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,387
THEY ARE THE GOOD GUYS.

24
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:50,289
NORM McDONALD ONCE TWEETED

25
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,524
"THE IDIOT SEES THE WORLD AS

26
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:57,496
VERSUS EVIL.

27
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:05,137
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BATTLE OF GOOD

28
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:06,138
VERSUS GOOD."

29
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,506
EVERYONE WHO ANNOYS YOU, THEY

30
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:09,708
THINK THEY ARE RIGHT, BUT SO DO

31
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,743
YOU, AND THAT ANNOYS THEM.

32
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:13,912
THE SOLUTION, UNDERSTAND FIRST

33
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:14,646
THAT WE LIVE OUR LIVES WITH

34
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:18,450
DIFFERENT FILTERS.

35
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:19,284
LEASE CULTURES CLASH.

36
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,652
STILL, WE ALL WANT THE SAME

37
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:29,661
DURING HURRICANE HARVEY, WE SAW

38
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:30,863
DEPLORABLES AND NONDEPLORABLES

39
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,872
WHAT DO YOU DO IN HARD TIMES?

40
00:01:39,873 --> 00:01:40,739
YOU HELP.

41
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,907
YOU COMPROMISE.

42
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:43,408
WHEN POSSIBLE, YOU ALWAYS

43
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:44,509
FORGIVE.

44
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,879
ISN'T IT A TIME FOR A PEACE

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,614
MOVEMENT BEGUN BY CONSERVATIVES?

46
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,649
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE THE GUYS IN

47
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:53,652
RETURN.

48
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:55,454
IF SOMEONE THINKS YOU ARE EVIL,

49
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:56,955
ALL YOU CAN DO THROUGH YOUR

50
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,323
ACTIONS IS PROVE THEM WRONG.

51
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:00,559
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, AT LEAST YOU

52
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,333
HEY, JUAN, I WANT TO GO TO YOU

53
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,101
FIRST.

54
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:10,969
I BELIEVE WE WERE GOING TO

55
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,839
CREATE SOME KIND OF REDUCTION IN

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,275
HOSTILITIES, IT'S GOT TO COME

57
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:17,476
FROM CONSERVATIVES, BECAUSE YOU

58
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:19,111
CAN'T EXPECT IT FROM THE PEOPLE

59
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:20,445
WHO ARE OUT OF POWER.

60
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,885
BECAUSE YOU ARE UPSET THAT YOU

61
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:28,887
ARE OUT OF POWER.

62
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:30,722
SO IT'S LIKE THE RESPONSIBILITY

63
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:33,292
OF THE PEOPLE, CONSERVATIVES,

64
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,893
SUPPORTERS OF TRUMP, TO EXTEND A

65
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:35,694
HAND.

66
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:36,728
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

67
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,633
I REALLY APPRECIATED, GREG.

68
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:44,136
IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS SO MUCH

69
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:46,872
ANIMOSITY IN THE AIR, AND

70
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:48,473
EVERYBODY IS THROWING SOMETHING

71
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:49,207
BEYOND SPITBALLS AT EACH OTHER

72
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,877
AT THIS POINT.

73
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:52,678
SUSPECT OF THEIR MOTIVES.

74
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,279
LISTENING TO WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

75
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,291
FOR THEMSELVES OR ADVANTAGE

76
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:07,159
THEIR FRIENDS DOING BUSINESS.

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,661
AT THAT MOMENT, I HAVE VERY

78
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:10,429
STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT SEPARATING

79
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,397
CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES.

80
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:14,299
I AM NOT GOING TO DENY THOSE

81
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,867
FEELINGS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

82
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,102
SHUT UP INEXPRESSIVE MY

83
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:19,204
FEELINGS, BUT I DO THINK WE ARE

84
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:22,541
OUT OF CONTROL IN TERMS OF THE

85
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:23,842
MOCKERY, BULLYING, THE ATTITUDE

86
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,944
THAT SAYS YOU ARE NOT WORTHY.

87
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:27,346
YOU ARE NOT UN-AMERICAN IF

88
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,614
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING WITH MY TEAM.

89
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:37,723
THEY HAVE MADE POLITICS

90
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:39,191
PERSONAL, SO NOW IT'S OUR TURN.

91
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:41,326
HOW DO YOU GET OUT OF THAT THING

92
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:43,695
WHERE YOU GO LIKE, OKAY, I'M

93
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,597
WILLING TO BE CIVIL EVEN IF YOU

94
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:46,131
AREN'T.

95
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,533
IT COULD GO FOR EITHER SIDE.

96
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,302
>> Jesse: IT'S TOUGH TO

97
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,503
UNILATERALLY LAY DOWN YOUR

98
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:52,838
WEAPONS AND POLITICS BECAUSE

99
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,313
BRO AND EVERYBODY SAID WE NEED

100
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,615
TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE, TONE

101
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,517
DOWN THE RHETORIC AND UNITE AS A

102
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:05,851
COUNTRY.

103
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:09,888
A YEAR LATER, HERE WE ARE IN THE

104
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:16,495
GET BACK TO BASICS.

105
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:17,895
WE ARE ALL AMERICANS.

106
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:19,631
THE THING WE DID YESTERDAY WITH

107
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,134
COMMON THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT

108
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:22,901
THAN EACH OTHER.

109
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:23,935
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

110
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:27,939
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A

111
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,142
DIFFERENCE WHEN TRUMP RETWEETS A

112
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:31,309
VIDEO OF HIMSELF BODY SLAMMING A

113
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,544
CNN LOGO AND SOME OF THE THINGS

114
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:34,713
THAT HAVE GONE ON ON THE LEFT.

115
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,249
IT WAS IN THE INAUGURATION THAT

116
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:37,849
THE LEFT FIREBOMBED THE

117
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,850
LIMOUSINES.

118
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,720
WE HAVE HAD BLACK LIVES MATTER

119
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,555
PEOPLE CHANT "DEATH TO COPS."

120
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:46,758
WE HAVE HAD ANTIFA SMASH NOR

121
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,531
WINDOWS -- STORE WINDOWS.

122
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:53,298
NANCY PELOSI HERSELF SAID THE

123
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:54,966
TAX CUTS WERE LITERALLY GOING TO

124
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,101
KILL PEOPLE.

125
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:58,103
I REMEMBER BACK IN THE OBAMA

126
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:00,472
ADMINISTRATION, A RODEO CLOWN

127
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,173
DRESSED UP AS PRESIDENT OBAMA

128
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:03,809
AND HE LOST HIS JOB IMMEDIATELY.

129
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,977
NOW A SENATE STAFFER FOR A

130
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:09,848
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR YELLED F YOU

131
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,116
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE

132
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,857
I AM WILLING TO SAY WHEN MY SIDE

133
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:20,325
IS WRONG BUT THE OTHER SIDE

134
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,828
NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TOO.

135
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,529
RIGHT NOW THERE IS A DIVISION IN

136
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,134
TACTICS GOING TO BE?

137
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:32,871
PELOSI WHO KNOW HOW TO WIN

138
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:33,338
ELECTIONS.

139
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,406
DEMOCRATS WIN WHEN THEY ARE

140
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:35,707
MODERATE OR PRETEND TO BE

141
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,709
MODERATE, AND THEY GET IT.

142
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,677
THEY KNOW WHEN TO CONDEMN.

143
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:41,113
THE ACTIVISTS, WHERE THE ENERGY

144
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:42,714
IS, THEY ARE OKAY AND THEY WANT

145
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,717
THEY LIKE THE MOB ACTION.

146
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,619
THAT EXCITES THEM, THEY'RE GOING

147
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,854
TO HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITHOUT

148
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:49,955
INTERNAL TURMOIL ALL THE WAY

149
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,490
THROUGH 20 THROUGH 2020 BECAUSE

150
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,958
RIGHT NOW, THE DIVISION IS ON

151
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,160
THAT SIDE AND IT'S GETTING

152
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:55,560
PRETTY UGLY.

153
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,330
>> Greg: AS YOU KNOW,

154
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:00,298
KIMBERLY, I AM NOT PRACTICING

155
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,101
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE CHRISTLIKE

156
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,473
WHEN JESSE TALKS ABOUT THE OTHER

157
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:10,342
SIDE THAT IS MORE HOSTILE, THE

158
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:11,943
REACTION SHOULD BE TO TURN THE

159
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:12,811
OTHER CHEEK.

160
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:16,314
DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING?

161
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:18,683
>> Kimberly: IT'S A VERY GOOD

162
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,885
DISCUSSION, A HEALTHY DISCUSSION

163
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:22,687
TO TRY TO CREATE SOME KIND OF

164
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:23,688
UNITY, SOME CIVILITY ON BOTH

165
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:23,989
SIDES.

166
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,158
I THINK IT'S NOT HELPFUL TO

167
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,726
FINGER POINT AND SAY THEY ARE

168
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,494
WORSE THAN THIS SIDE ET CETERA.

169
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,932
FURTHER DISCOURSE, THEIR

170
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,867
RHETORIC, THEIR CONDUCT,

171
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:37,135
EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE

172
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,570
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

173
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,339
WE LEAD INDIVIDUALLY BY EXAMPLE.

174
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,314
OR TURNING A WAY A FAMILY SAYING

175
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:51,182
THEY CAN'T EAT AT A PLACE OR

176
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:52,350
THINGS LIKE THAT.

177
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:53,685
IT'S TAKING UP TOO FAR.

178
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:55,854
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A HEALTHY

179
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:58,690
DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENTS

180
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,191
ABOUT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OR

181
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:00,558
IDEOLOGY.

182
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,127
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING

183
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,567
DISRESPECT, I -- IT'S CONDUCT

184
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:09,968
UNBECOMING.

185
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:14,739
>> Greg: DANA, THIS IS AN

186
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,707
INTERNAL CONFLICT.

187
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,441
NO ONE IN THE WAR THINKS THEY

188
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,910
ARE THE BAD GUY.

189
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,312
IF EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE

190
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:22,714
RIGHT, THAT THEY ARE THE GOOD

191
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:24,516
GUYS, HOW DO YOU GET THE PERSON

192
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,751
WHO THINKS THEY ARE RIGHT TO

193
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:28,320
ALSO SEE THAT YOU MIGHT BE

194
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:32,390
ETERNAL QUESTION?

195
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:36,561
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

196
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:37,495
IT ALWAYS WAS SURPRISING HE

197
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:43,735
WHAT A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP CAN

198
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:44,302
DO.

199
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:46,438
THERE WAS A COUPLE TIMES I THINK

200
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,272
THE DEMOCRATS HAD DINNER AT THE

201
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:50,575
WHITE HOUSE AND THINGS LIKE THAT

202
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:52,143
IN THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION

203
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:54,479
BUT TURN THE OTHER CHEEK HAS

204
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,181
BEEN REPLACED BY COUNTER

205
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:57,315
PUNCHING, AND IT'S SUCCESSFUL.

206
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,850
DO I SEE IT CHANGING?

207
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,119
NOT NECESSARILY, AND THE PEOPLE

208
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,853
REALIZE WHILE, WE ARE REALLY

209
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:05,356
CLOSE TO UNRAVELING WHAT WE

210
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:11,296
SOMETHING, AND IF YOU ARE

211
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:12,330
PRIVILEGED TO BE ON TELEVISION,

212
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:14,432
TO HAVE A CHANCE TO GIVE YOUR

213
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,533
OPINIONS ABOUT SOMETHING OR

214
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:16,468
DEBATE SOMETHING WITH SOMEBODY,

215
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:18,136
YOU HAVE A CHOICE IN WHAT YOU

216
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:18,403
SAY.

217
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:20,305
I ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE

218
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,273
RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S

219
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:22,974
WORDS.

220
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:24,576
POLICING YOUR OWN SIDE, THERE IS

221
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:25,677
SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT THAT

222
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:29,113
BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE THAT'S A

223
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:29,948
LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY.

224
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:36,521
OUT, THE COLUMNIST WHO WROTE A

225
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:37,288
GREAT BOOK.

226
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:47,265
ORGANIZATIONS.

227
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,533
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FREEMASONS

228
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:49,701
THE OTHER DAY.

229
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:50,435
THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU HAD

230
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:53,104
ORGANIZATIONS WHERE PEOPLE COULD

231
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:54,906
BELONG, AND NOBODY WANTS TO

232
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,308
REALLY BELONG TO ANYTHING

233
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:02,647
POSSIBILITIES OF GETTING PEOPLE

234
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:07,519
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE CALLS FOR

235
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,887
CIVILITY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH

236
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:09,921
FREE SPEECH.

237
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,890
LIKE OKAY, WHENEVER I COME IN

238
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:14,726
AND I MARCH AND MY VOICE IS

239
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:15,660
LOUD, YOU'RE CALLING THAT

240
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:21,533
MATTERS.

241
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:22,300
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR

242
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:24,636
THE LOUD NOISES BUT THAT'S THE

243
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:27,705
ONLY TIME YOU LISTEN.

244
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:30,308
BUT IS THAT ALLOWING FOR TOO

245
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:30,608
MUCH?

246
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:31,809
>> Juan: NO.

247
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,710
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

248
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:34,345
IT'S IN AMERICA.

249
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,813
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO --

250
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:37,315
>> Greg: LIKE GOING TO

251
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:37,949
SOMEBODY'S HOUSE?

252
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,951
>> Juan: YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR

253
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:40,518
EYES TO REALITY.

254
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,320
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

255
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,721
PROTEST AND HAVE A LEGITIMATE

256
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,622
GRIEVANCE, WHICH IS ABOUT

257
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:46,724
CHILDREN OR SOME OF THE OTHER

258
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:48,159
POLICIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.

259
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,460
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU

260
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:50,929
HANDLE IT?

261
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,764
PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

262
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:53,865
BREAKDOWN OF FACTS AND PEOPLE

263
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,333
SAYING WELL, I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT

264
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:55,633
THAT.

265
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,402
THAT'S NOT A FACT I'M FAMILIAR

266
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:59,470
WITH THAT KIND OF THING.

267
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:02,840
PEOPLE HAVE TO GET IT STRAIGHT.

268
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,909
I SAW A POLL, KNOWING THEY WERE

269
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,745
GOING TO DISCUSS THIS, THE POLL

270
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:13,484
CIVILITY IN THE COUNTRY HAS GONE

271
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:13,785
DOWN.

272
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,620
TRUMP, HE HAS TO TAKE SOME

273
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:16,354
RESPONSIBILITY BUT THAT DOESN'T

274
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:19,290
MEAN THAT THE LEFT HAS BEEN SAY

275
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,259
SINCE HE'S DOING THAT AND ACTING

276
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,127
AND SAYING "LOCK HER UP" AND

277
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:24,596
THAT KIND OF STUFF, THAT WE HAVE

278
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:26,297
TO BEHAVE THAT WAY.

279
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,199
I THINK THERE ARE POLITICS

280
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,567
INVOLVED AND THERE'S A

281
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:29,968
CALCULATION.

282
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,235
WHEN TRUMP SAYS SOME OF THESE

283
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,770
VERY PROVOCATIVE THINGS, IT

284
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,572
STIRS UP HIS BASE.

285
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,140
BUT GUESS WHAT, I THINK THE

286
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:37,175
DEMOCRATS THEN COMMEND THIS

287
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:38,576
RESPONSE TO ADJUSTING WITH

288
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:39,344
INCOME OF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO

289
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:40,912
BE SMART NOT TO SAY YOU CAN

290
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:42,981
EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS BUT WE DON'T

291
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:44,582
WANT TO SEE THIS ATTITUDE ON THE

292
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,785
PART OF THE RIGHT THAT THE LEFT

293
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:49,320
IS SO CONDESCENDING AND

294
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:49,687
ARROGANT.

295
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,322
YOU'VE GOT TO AT SOME POINT SAY

296
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,291
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE

297
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:53,591
ABOUT.

298
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:56,227
THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE PARENTS

299
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,362
>> Jesse: I THINK YOU SAW THAT

300
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,263
WITH PELOSI AND SCHUMER COMING

301
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:02,100
OUT AGAINST WHAT MAXINE WATERS

302
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:02,400
SAID.

303
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:03,901
RECENTLY SOMEONE BURNED A DEAD

304
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,939
CARCASS OF AN ANIMAL ON A TRUMP

305
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:12,176
RESTAURANT.

306
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:15,146
FOLLOWING HER ACROSS THE STREET.

307
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:16,247
GOING OUTSIDE STEPHEN MILLER'S

308
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:16,914
APARTMENT AND CHANTING

309
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:17,715
THREATENING THINGS.

310
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:18,716
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER,

311
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,151
YOU SAID THIS BEFORE.

312
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,220
SOMETIMES YOU ASSUME THE OTHER

313
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,921
SIDE HAS EVIL INTENTIONS WHEN IN

314
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,526
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.

315
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:29,727
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IN THE

316
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,763
BEGINNING, I USED TO THINK IF

317
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:32,563
ANYONE CAN WORK WITH

318
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:33,364
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S THE

319
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:33,931
DEMOCRATS.

320
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:34,599
HE SHOWED THAT.

321
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,703
HE WENT AGAINST RYAN AND

322
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:39,404
McCONNELL AND WENT WITH PELOSI

323
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:40,204
AND SCHUMER WHEN IT CAME TO DACA

324
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:42,340
IN THE BEGINNING.

325
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:43,241
HE IS WILLING TO REACH ACROSS

326
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,376
THE ISLE BUT RIGHT NOW THAT GOLF

327
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:47,512
SEEMS REALLY DEEP.

328
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:51,883
BIGGEST MISTAKES AND INCIVILITY

329
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:52,917
IS LABELING PEOPLE.

330
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:56,154
I THINK WE NOTICED THAT, EVEN IN

331
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,321
THE PRIMARIES, PEOPLE CALLING

332
00:11:57,322 --> 00:12:02,894
EACH OTHER RINOS AND THINGS LIKE

333
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:03,528
THAT.

334
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,762
THE DIVISION WASN'T JUST LEFT OR

335
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:05,930
RIGHT.

336
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:06,931
IT WAS WITHIN EACH SEPARATE

337
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:09,200
DIVISION.

338
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:10,802
>> Dana: YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE

339
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:12,704
TO ACCEPT THAT BEING NICE DIDN'T

340
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:13,705
WORK, SO THIS IS WHAT WE ARE

341
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:14,672
GOING TO DO.

342
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,741
IT'S A NEW WORLD, NOW WE ARE

343
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:18,109
TALKING ABOUT, THERE ARE DANGERS

344
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,976
OF INCIVILITY BECAUSE IT COULD

345
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:22,447
LEAD TO POSSIBLE VIOLENCE.

346
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:23,314
THESE HAVEN'T GOTTEN VIOLENT

347
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,149
YET, THOUGH I WOULD ARGUE THAT

348
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,651
THE BURNING OF THE CARCASS ON

349
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:27,852
THE FRONT PORCH, YOU'RE GOING TO

350
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,921
THINK YOU'RE BEING ATTACKED.

351
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:31,122
WHAT DO YOU DO?

352
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,123
IT COULD SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL.

353
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:33,925
WE HAVE SUCH A GIFT OF BEING

354
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:36,527
ABLE TO LIVE IN FREEDOM AND WITH

355
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,900
TO PRESERVE IT.

356
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,136
DO NOT LOSE THIS CHANCE TO HAVE

357
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:47,338
THIS REALLY GREAT, WONDERFUL

358
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:47,839
COUNTRY CONTINUE.

359
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,439
>> Kimberly: IT'S TRUE.

360
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,374
IF YOU LET IT GET AWAY FROM YOU,

361
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,743
YOU SEE THINGS SPIRALING OUT.

362
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:54,345
FEELS LIKE DANGEROUS TIMES IN

363
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:55,747
TERMS OF THE INCENDIARY

364
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,915
RHETORIC, THE ACTIONS, THE

365
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,118
VIOLENT PROTESTS.

366
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,486
NOBODY WINS WITH THAT.

367
00:13:01,487 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Juan: IF THERE WAS ONE
