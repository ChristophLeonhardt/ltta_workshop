remember when members of Congress were considering regulating certain things like bump stocks following the mass shooting that occurred in Las Vegas well if you've forgotten so have members of Congress because nothing has been done and the shooting took place weeks ago and every passing day becomes less and less likely that they will do something to ban or regulate bump stocks now bump stocks are essentially devices that are utilized to turn a semi-automatic weapon into a weapon that acts as an automatic weapon and so this is an issue and that is exactly what was used by the Las Vegas mass shooter now there were some attempts there were examples of legislation that were written by both members of the House and the Senate but they have gone nowhere so for example a bill was introduced by representatives Carlos coup Bello Crivello and Seth Moulton and it had 20 co-sponsors in total ten Democratic and ten Republicans so it was a bipartisan effort but aides say that there is no indication that the House Judiciary Committee is going to consider that bill that's based on reporting by Sam Stein at The Daily Beast now the NRA even came out and said okay we're open to regulating bump stocks but they did something I would argue something clever and we didn't realize it at the time so essentially what the NRA said was maybe the ATF should be in charge of regulating it but the ATF is not a regulatory body it's not Congress they're not able to write and pass legislation that is the job of Congress and essentially what the NRA did there was give Congress a pass so if they do nothing they can just be like well it's the ATF that's supposed to do something about it ATF responds and says no we don't write laws we don't draft legislation no it goes a little further than that because it sounds like well it gives a executive branch and so they might be able to regulate but there is a specific law forbidding the ATF from regulating this issue so they know that so they go okay this will be a cute little trick we'll say that we're in favor of regulating bump stocks and and everybody will report that on the front page oh and I rate being reasonable moderate NRA etc but we know that when they go to do a bill will tell everybody will spent you know how much the NRA spent on the last election fifty million dollars almost all going to Republicans so then will tell all the Republicans don't you dare do legislation go to the ATF is that an don't seem like oh what they're doing regulation they're bringing in to the ATF but they already know that the ATF cannot regulate it based on a previous law so it is a complete dirty trick so they're laughing at you for all the people who died during using this in essence fully automatic automatic weapon going you know how many people died with so not only did we have fifty eight people who were dead in just Las Vegas alone but five hundred and forty six people were injured he mowed down six hundred people you know why when you have the bump stock you can fire eight hundred bullets in a minute but people need that for like hunting and stuff a totally we when a swarm of deer or bunnies attack you you really need to be able to find eight hundred bullets in them in a minute the only reason if I eight hundred bullets in a minute is to murder as many humans as possible doesn't help you with hunting and if an intruder comes in you really need eight hundred bullets fired in a minute okay so no it is to murder people and the NRA they are merchants of death they profit off of death so they think it's really cute to trick you guys after your loved ones have died and you think wow okay I mean that was one off I mean Jesus that was a really bad incident but does that happen all the time of course not only do we have the mass shootings that happened literally every day last year 2016 there were more mass shootings than there were days in the year that's when more than four people get shot at one time but since the Vegas shooting there have been 900 people killed from gun homicides for gun related deaths and it hasn't even been a month it's just been three weeks so they know that and they know that people die from this and some of it is obviously the Vegas was bump stocks the others are normally just handguns and they make money every time they don't care that your family members die and so they bought off all these politicians and these politicians like Paul Ryan who said oh no no I'm gonna kill the bill there's no way we're voting on that bill let's just not waste our time anymore right so every time there's a mass shooting let's go ahead and cover it and give you guys the details and the facts of how many people were gunned down because of inaction in Congress and it refusal to do anything because they're getting their pockets padded by people you know running the NRA but let's not talk about legislation anymore let's not waste our time because every single time there's a mass shooting by the way again 900 people have died due to gun violence since the fitt Vegas shooting doesn't matter since it's not 58 people at a time it doesn't even get any coverage anymore it's become so commonplace in the US but I'm just tired of having the same conversation over and over again it's gonna lead to nowhere there's nothing to be done okay and the people in power in this country have no empathy and no sympathy for individuals who a lost their lives or the family members who lost their loved ones as a result of this inaction by our law makers so it's just I'm tired of it I'm tired of having this nonsensical you know conversation over and over again it's beyond frustrating look we don't this is why I harp on money in politics because that's the answer this isn't about gun control we don't live in a democracy if it was about if we lived in a democracy we would have gun control right now Associated Press recent poll 61% of people say they favor tougher gun laws when you make it specific and say federal background checks the number jumps that 93 percent okay now but overall just vague gun laws are they good enough sixty-one say no they're not good enough make them tougher 27% say they should remain unchanged eleven percent want them to be looser so in a democracy the 61 percent certainly to 93 percent would win super easy but we don't live in a democracy we have privatized the elections so we talk about privatizing things they shouldn't do like health care are you kidding me we privatized the entire government so it is privately financed elections so Paul Ryan the Republicans that are in charge take that money they spend it in largely in TV ads and then all of a sudden TV loves money in politics they don't cover the corruption ever and and and they buy these elections by having a lot more money and then they turn around go ninety three percent what a federal background check I don't care I don't care what you stupid voters want the Koch brothers gave me money NRA gave me money I do as they tell me to do they're the one who put me in office by running all those deceptive ads pretending that I was on your side when in fact I literally make money off of you dying whether it's in health care or in the NRA situation so and that's right the next time it doesn't matter if it does matter every time there's a mass shooting we all know how it's gonna play out and and look and every single time each one of us goes through TSA when we're trying to travel and we're getting groped and we're you know going through these scanners and exposing ourselves to radiation and having these like you know semi nude images taken of us we go through all of that out of fear that you know the bad actors might take advantage of a lack of security right but when it comes to an issue like this doesn't matter how many people get gunned down in any type of mass shooting doesn't matter if it was five hundred people who died rather than getting injured doesn't matter when those kids died nothing was done fifty eight people were gunned down recently nothing was done the death toll I guarantee you will be higher in the future and nothing will be done nothing will be done because who cares American lives mean nothing to our politicians compared to the amount of they can receive from corporations and lobbying groups like the NRA so to give you context on these numbers in three months you'll have as many people dead actually in less than three months as you had on 9/11 just from gun violence and yes it is an absolute fact and you track this through all the different countries that have different gun laws that the stricter the gun control is the less people die from gun deaths and it's also super obvious but it's backed up by overwhelming data so those people die the scale of 9/11 every three months and it's right we go to oh my god the shoe bomber the underwear bomber both unsuccessful oh no we can't even take one percent chance take off your jacket your belt stripped down naked or do all this stuff well how about the four 911s that happen every single year because of gun buzz no no no way we can't even regulate it even 1% it's the exact opposite right they you're on a terrorism watch this doesn't matter you get to buy guns you have mental problems it doesn't matter you get to buy guns you want to buy fully automatic guns in essence now and shoe 800 bowls a minute yes sure you want to murder cops with armor-piercing bullets while we pretend to be for blue lives matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you want to be a criminal and and and make sure that your guns can't be tracked by your finger it's fingerprints great let's make your criminal ow you to be criminals easier and then they say oh well no gun control doesn't work because I look California is slightly tougher gun laws slightly tougher gun laws but there's full of violence with using guns in California and I always say we're in an ocean of guns right so you know what they did they did a study in the annals of internal medicine that was just released on Tuesday deaths and injuries in California towns after a gun show held in Las Vegas so it's a California town kind of near Las Vegas then not California does that close to Las Vegas but still after the gun show in Vegas the Taos in California their gun deaths and injuries jump by 70% that's weird jank but I thought if state had stringent gun laws then there would be no gun violence right because we have gigantic walls on the border of every state and we're not one country we're just all these separate states that have their own governing bodies and have gigantic walls that prevent you know any guns from going we're one country that one art that argument drives me absolutely insane because it's disingenuous right when people say oh well you know this one city or this one state has strict gun laws that city or state laws don't matter when you consider the fact that we are swimming in guns will you consider the fact that people can buy pretty much as many guns as they want at the back of a truck at a gun show so no you need a comprehensive approach you need a federal approach okay the gun laws in a local level don't matter at all oh alright last thing on this guy it's just so frustrating the last thing that city does which is the propaganda they do that drives me crazy is they say wow look you gotta understand it's the culture of America and it's the Old West then we you know that's how this country came up and that's why people love their guns no 93 percent of Americans want a federal background check you are 100% wrong about the culture of America it has nothing to do with the culture yes there's some there's a portion of the culture that loves guns I understand that but is it the majority of the country no it's not we have polling to prove it it what it is is the corruption the gun manufacturers bought the politicians so they don't care you could what do you want ninety nine percent they agree on a federal background check that's not the issue the issue is they may have privatized financing of Elections and they work for those private interests including them on gun manufacturers so it doesn't matter if they're fifty eight people were killed or a hundred and fifty eight people were killed in that incident doesn't matter if it was nine hundred or nine thousand people who died every three weeks the Republicans and yes a good portion of their Democrats will continue to vote based on the checks that they received because that is the system we set up based on complete and utter corruption qit membership gives you commercial free young turks downloaded stream it podcasts that get all the network's show and
