00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,099
that I thought I'd make it into a mini

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,759

of wine<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drink as I relax I hear that</font>

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,399
drinking a glass of red wine a day is

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,200
good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i very</font>

16
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,489
it better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do here it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not good</font>

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:48,840
for you in other ways there's always

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,899
contradicting research isn't there but

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,629

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,840
come back at like a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,180
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this is that we all just chill</font>

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,150
and relax you know life can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get pretty</font>

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,130
crazy so it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a moment of</font>

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,310
calm before we go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into our crazy</font>

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,140
lifestyles I feel actually unwilling to

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,600
have a sip because I'm time is limited

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,140
but that's good I have questions that

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,689
been submitted by a Twitter Facebook and

36
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,329
Tumblr and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want me to answer</font>

comments please do just putting capitals

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,219
question first so I know it is a

43
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">question for me to answer future time</font>

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,810
and the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one comes from mr.</font>

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,020
you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube has changed for the</font>

47
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,479
better or the worst in terms of content

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,508
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> design um well at the moment we're</font>

49
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,220
seeing the transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a new YouTube</font>

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,440
format I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge fan of the</font>

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">home page menu but we're never happy of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">change when it happens and they're doing</font>

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,910
it gradual gradually which is good

54
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,260
facebook you know if anyone's used it

55
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,050
realizes they just change it instantly

56
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,190
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a lot more</font>

57
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,540
uncomfortable to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

58
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,390
feel a bit disorientated<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think YouTube</font>

59
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,310
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to turn really really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good or</font>

60
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">better should I say with all these</font>

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,270
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I work with Google in some</font>

62
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,750
capacities and from what I've seen it's

63
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,170
going to be epic so stay tuned for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

64
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,420
Ellis on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter asks how big a part do</font>

65
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,490
you think apathy and impatience of the

66
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,930
general public play in today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

67
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,840
issues what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font>

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,140
know if you aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing something if</font>

69
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something can you be</font>

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,550
classed as a part of the problem because

71
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,170
you've not actively done something

72
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,060
because we could argue a lot of the

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,890
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that exist in society today are</font>

74
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,710
due to government and them just doing

75
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,130
things wrong or banks just screwing us

76
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,520
screwing us over with their one motive

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,260
to make money with no consideration for

78
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,820
social concern or well-being of the

79
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,570
world so um yeah I think apathy is one

80
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,010
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest issues at the moment you</font>

81
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,660
know the people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking to the</font>

82
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">streets protesting that may not be what</font>

83
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,750
create solutions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is creating</font>

84
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,430
discussion which is the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing</font>

85
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,780
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning to wake</font>

86
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,940
up and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

87
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend all our time just working our jobs</font>

88
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,250
paying our taxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out drinking with</font>

89
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,290
friends partying going on facebook

90
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">liking statuses but while that's all</font>

91
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,060
happening is there are legislations been

92
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,860
passed by the US government so they can

93
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,860
imprison any member of any US<font color="#E5E5E5"> citizen</font>

94
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,420
indefinitely without evidence and

95
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,280
without trial that is absolutely

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrifying and apathy is just going to</font>

97
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,110
allow governments to do it so we need to

98
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,250
stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say look governments do not</font>

99
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,700
represent the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99 percent and we can get</font>

100
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,560
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the 99 percent by</font>

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">vishal that can be left as another</font>

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,140
question because the truth is

103
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,740
representative

104
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,410
democracy doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am deadly for</font>

105
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,360
direct democracy which was saying I

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,190
wasn't for even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

107
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks ago I just looked into it and well</font>

108
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,580
yeah it we can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

109
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,639
time Helen of haids on tumblr asks how

110
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,590
did you come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop such a calm yet</font>

111
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,210
passionate way of speaking about things

112
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,370
that you feel passionate about well I

113
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,669
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is when I was</font>

114
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing up and started doing public</font>

115
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,750
speaking I was terrified of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know</font>

116
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,979
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say more people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world are</font>

117
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,479
terrified of public speaking than they

118
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,000
are of death which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if that</font>

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,500
exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much anymore because a lot of</font>

120
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,940
people get confidence from using the

121
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,800
internet and building up their audiences

122
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,289
and you know social<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking all that</font>

123
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,710
sort of thing but I was someone who

124
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,270
never used to write scripts I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

125
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,569
just turn up and blog it which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

126
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:19,000
seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> lazy but as a result it meant I</font>

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,550
was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand up in front of large</font>

128
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,740
numbers of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do a</font>

129
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,659
speech which was well constructed and

130
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,030
actually constructed as I was talking

131
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,409
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth is I talk about</font>

132
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:35,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">things I only open my mouth if I feel</font>

133
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,490
the need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say something if I truly</font>

134
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe in it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> therefore I tend to be</font>

135
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,409
very well spoken with what I wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

136
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,539
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about because I'm speaking from the</font>

137
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,919
heart and it's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you look at</font>

138
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,650
politicians who are going oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

139
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,849
to remember what I said you know they're

140
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,259
having to remember because they're not

141
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">being honest if people were honest they</font>

142
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,219
wouldn't need to think about what they

143
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:58,150
said before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to some extent so um I'm</font>

144
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,060
just calm because I don't a force what I

145
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,490
believe on anyone and if you shout at

146
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,020
someone they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to</font>

147
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,150
you so you may as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> just become not</font>

148
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,880
patronizing but just careful with how

149
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,479
you speak and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just take it from</font>

150
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and even if just one person take</font>

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,139
something positive from what you say

152
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,479
then that's a good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah that's</font>

153
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,819
my advice on that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Toro on facebook</font>

154
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,580
asks how do you deal with SI d and if

155
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,780
anyone he doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what that is it's</font>

156
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,030
seasonal affective disorder which and I

157
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,250
believe I have I think it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

158
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,960
have a lot of really bad stuff happens

159
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me every year around Christmas past</font>

160
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,870
five or six years said

161
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,550
best friend died on Christmas Day which

162
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,450
was pretty pretty nasty and I know some

163
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,580
people of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sa they have like lights that</font>

164
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,080
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put by their bedside table</font>

165
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,460
which makes them feel better I don't

166
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,940
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually for the first time</font>

167
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,890
since I first thought I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> si di</font>

168
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually feel quite good this this</font>

169
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,370
winter<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then again it hasn't been as</font>

170
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,230
cold as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it normally is so how do I deal</font>

171
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,090
with it I just look for positive things

172
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,640
in life I just keep myself busy and if I

173
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,950
do feel sad I ask myself why you know I

174
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,740
don't go oh I am sad I go why am i sad

175
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,540
and what can I do about it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font>

176
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,160
comes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice of peaks and troughs</font>

177
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,070
you know the more depressions you've

178
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,080
gone through the better you are with

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,700
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it and to a certain degree</font>

180
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Maria on facebook asks why should we</font>

181
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,950
strive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to be or do our best if</font>

182
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,230
that's what we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I thought about</font>

183
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this a lot recently actually just</font>

184
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,940
because I've got I've got a terrible

185
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing happening in the family at the</font>

186
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,640
moment and I've began to not learn but

187
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,130
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that life is just way too short</font>

188
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,250
and so I live every day not necessary as

189
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,990
if it was my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz i might go</font>

190
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,020
skydiving every day I wouldn't but you

191
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">know i mean i don't i'm not trivial</font>

192
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,310
about life i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overdoing it</font>

193
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,480
but every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day is another day that we may</font>

194
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,470
lose everything our freedoms etc and so

195
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,090
every moment I have as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I get</font>

196
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,220
back from work I'm doing activism I'm

197
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,170
talking to people I'm speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

198
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,030
friends I'm trying to educate people and

199
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,430
make people wake up and realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

200
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,020
can all be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the solution we can</font>

201
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">all be a part of a constructive society</font>

202
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,660
so and why should we strive because if

203
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,330
you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing your best then you're</font>

204
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">not making the most out of life you know</font>

205
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,470
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't overdo things but just</font>

206
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,750
just don't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you think</font>

207
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,280
you'll regret<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the same time don't</font>

208
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,750
regret your past because you can only

209
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,220
change your future<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luis on facebook asks</font>

210
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,169
if you were the prime minister<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the UK</font>

211
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,640
what would you change I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

212
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask me this because I did used to</font>

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,460
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into politics when I was</font>

214
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,130
younger not what was I didn't want to

215
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,530
originally and when I got involved in

216
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,060
him

217
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">tarian issues and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought yeah maybe</font>

218
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,870
politics is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way of doing it but the</font>

219
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,020
political system of today is failing us

220
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,430
because it is completely immersed in

221
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,320
corruption which is from a monetary

222
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,800
system it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bound tightly</font>

223
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,260
with corporations and governments are

224
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,970
effectively businesses you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font>

225
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,680
have a cash flow and they have to

226
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,140
allocate resources do you really feel

227
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,279
the people the people's interests or you

228
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,770
know sorry do you think the people are

229
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,870
what who they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about most</font>

230
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,950
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think so what they'll do</font>

231
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,510
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll do as much they can to keep</font>

232
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">people quiet to keep people working and</font>

233
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,580
you know keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and and keep</font>

234
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,170
calm as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are protests</font>

235
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,339
they'll say they'll deal with it and

236
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,320
then you know that continue with

237
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,960
whatever they want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

238
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,520
looking at my time now so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be</font>

239
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,300
getting quite close<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got 40 seconds</font>

240
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,190
so if I was UK Prime Minister<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

241
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,900
just change the system completely I

242
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,760
would make direct democracy come in

243
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,480
place which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where every policy would</font>

244
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,870
be voted by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public and I used to</font>

245
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,480
disagree of that because I was told by

246
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,589
got a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that if they did</font>

247
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the UK which is the argument</font>

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,430
against it is the death penalty would

249
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,580
come back in because um that would be

250
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,470
horrific<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's just that the way</font>

251
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,810
society is today but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

252
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,400
actually be a good thing in the long run

253
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,830
because if the death penalty did get

254
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,990
brought in people would go oh wow what

255
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,060
have we done hopefully that's what would

256
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and then as a result they would</font>

257
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,400
reflect and actually would realize we

258
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,050
have a responsibility I love to her so

259
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,900
yeah my times up and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just finished</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

260
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,570
point really people would realize that

261
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,370
we have a responsibility and therefore

262
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,780
people would get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and vote and not</font>

263
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">only would they just go and vote they</font>

264
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,380
would actually research and educate

265
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,520
themselves to realize what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

266
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,780
voting on because they would realize

267
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,000
that their vote would have implications

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,570
for their country and thus the world so

269
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,430
direct democracy I definitely think is

270
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,200
the next stage we have the internet

271
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,020
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the greatest tool for that but</font>

272
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,390
it's a shame that a lot of members of

273
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">government keep down talking anyone who</font>

274
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,390
gets on these web

275
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,310
so it's doing petitions you know at the

276
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,420
end of the day they meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent</font>

277
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,150
us and they're not representing us or

278
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,450
not the most of us anyway so yeah thank
