they worried we left the dreamers we
love everybody sources tell CNN that

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,280
President Trump is expected to end an
Obama era program that protects young

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,389
undocumented immigrants who were brought
to the US as children from being

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,619
deported the issue one of the
president's core campaign promises I

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,210
want the children that are growing up in
the United States to be dreamers also

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,670
they're not dreaming right now president
Trump's plan would affect some 800,000

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,989
so-called dreamers studying and working
in the u.s. two sources with knowledge

8
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,070
of Trump's thinking tell CNN that the
president is planning to delay his

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,629
action for six months giving Congress
time to come up with a legislative

10
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,550
replacement to daca but a growing number
of Republicans are speaking out against

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,750
the move these kids don't know any other
home I think there's a humane way to fix

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,250
this I think President Trump agrees with
fixing this and it's got to be up to the

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,920
legislature there are 800,000 daca kids
kids who are brought across the border

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,990
the median age I think is six years old
for those 800,000 when they came across

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,610
the border they should not be punished
for the sins of their parents senator

Bernie Sanders says ending the program
would be one of the ugliest and cruelest

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,670
decisions ever made while Republican
Congressman Steve King praised it as a

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,409
chance to restore rule of law we're
going to deal with daca with heart I

19
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,040
have to do with a lot of politicians
don't forget and I have to convince them

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,150
that what I'm saying is is right the
daca situation is a very very it's a

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,369
very difficult thing for me because you
know I love these kids before leaving

22
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,899
the White House mr. Trump's predecessor
vowed not to remain silent if he went

23
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,280
after dreamers efforts to round up kids
who have grown up here in and for all

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,820
practical purposes our American kids and
send them someplace else

25
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:07,110
when they love this country getting an
outcome on daca has been made all the

26
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,570
more urgent due to a threat by ten
attorneys general to take the case to

27
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,160
court if there's not a decision from the
administration by tomorrow September 5th
