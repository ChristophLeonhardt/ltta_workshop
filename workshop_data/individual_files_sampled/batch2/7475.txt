today Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced about 400 arrests related to healthcare fraud schemes totaling over 1.3 billion dollars that were apparently stolen among the 412 defendants 120 were charged with opioid related crimes and so that is certainly considering the epidemic that the were in the middle of that's the sort of thing you want to see people who are theoretically getting people addicted unnecessarily pumping the marketplace full of pills that aren't needed that can cause a lot of the problems that we're seeing there are potentially some bad sides to this but why don't we turn now to the Attorney General who is announcing what's been done the Department of Justice in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing the largest health care fraud takedown operation in American history the Department of Justice coordinated efforts between criminal division's US Attorneys offices Health Care Health and Human Services and more than 1,000 state local and federal law enforcement agents to charge four hundred and twelve defendants including fifty-six doctors these defendants have defrauded taxpayers of approximately 1.3 billion dollars as a result of this operation 205 health care providers are now in the process of being suspended or banned from participation in any federal health care programs you're the worst I'm about okay let me give you an idea of some of these schemes that people were eventually arrested for he talked about doctors as six of the doctors were charged with operating a scheme in Michigan to prescribe patients with unnecessary opioids some of which were then sold on the street we understand that's a big problem the doctors allegedly billed Medicare for one hundred and sixty four million dollars and false and fraudulent claims that is that's a lot of work for six doctors let me know I know they make a lot of money but that's more than you would imagine a clinic in Houston allegedly gave out prescriptions for cash that's how it works actually officials said one doctor the clinic provided 12,000 opioid prescriptions for over two milli in illegal painkiller doses Wow that is insane now rehab my favorite was some of the doctors wrote so many prescriptions for controlled substances in one month then an entire Hospital did Wow amazing man one of them wrote so many prescriptions his hand was hurting had to take opioids to calm down the pain a rehab facility for drug addicts in Palm Beach is alleged to have recruited addicts with gift cards visits to strip clubs and drugs and it billed the government for over 58 million dollars in false treatment and tests and so this gave an idea like a lot of the people arrested did not get those huge sums obviously we're talking about 1.3 billion dollars overall and that's about three clinics did several hundred million of it but this is obviously a huge issue this is not going to solve the problem even the money that's currently being allocated and what could potentially become the new Senate health care bill if that becomes law is not enough to by itself solve the problem to remind you of the problem let's bring up this chart that we've shown you several times before on the show that is an increase in drug overdose deaths now that is of course not limited to opioids that's all drugs but opioids are an increasing percentage of it and you see how that is just shooting up that is us that is a societal problem that is a problem with regulation of the pharmaceutical industry and doctors and their ability to prescribe things whether they're actually needed or not and it is killing tens of thousands of people every single year so I remember having covered this a long time ago on and a doctor wrote in that I really like and said no no the doctors wouldn't do this right and come on guys most doctors of course wouldn't do this because there's a lot of different ways to make money but they mainly I give them the benefit of the doubt I which I think they they have earned they mainly went in to do the right thing and to help people and cure people but are there bad folks in each profession of course so you know when there's this much money to be made yeah you're gonna find a couple hundred doctors in the country and in this case it's 15 doctors and nurses and other licensed medical professionals who are willing to do the wrong thing for given enough incentive to do so yeah so look I think the real gateway drug is prescription painkillers and I think saying marijuana is a gateway drug is completely counter actual it's not true we know what the gateway drug is and in this case it is a very clear line from those legal drugs to heroin because they can't get either the prescriptions filled anymore or they can't afford it anymore and they just and heroines cheaper and then there's fentanyl and then you're dead so having said all of that and putting the spittoon aside I actually want to give them sessions here in the Justice Department credit and sessions it's not a guy I'm awfully fond of but this is a nice operation and and look this thing kills fifty nine thousand people a year if any terrorist group killed fifty nine thousand Americans every year we would we would invade seventeen countries to fight back against it but they in this case they put a thousand law enforcement agents on it in 30 different states so great at least some sense of proportion for how big the problem is so a job well done here in getting these arrests and hopefully the investment made in getting these four hundred people theoretically will stop far more from actually doing these sorts of fraud schemes in the first place the last comment I want to make is I looted to the bad side of this and the bad side is not in who was arrested or anything like that but Jeff Sessions while I'm glad like jank that he's taking this seriously because far far too few people are taking the opioid epidemic seriously in his extended comments talked a lot about the massive drug at epidemic that we have and drug dealers all over the country and he there is not talking exclusively about opioids and we know Jeff Sessions his background we know what he thinks about his recent comments about the DARE program and how that's needed how we need a new war on drugs and he's not just talking about prescription painkillers he wants to go after vigorously legal marijuana wherever it is illegal marijuana as well and that's the sort of thing that unfortunately will get a lot more people arrested and not people who are defrauding the government of hundreds of millions of dollars people who are simply smoking a little bit of marijuana that's who Jeff Sessions is historically and I'm worried that he could theoretically use this sort of thing to pursue that agenda in the future marijuana has nothing new with opioids except the fact that whenever you legalize marijuana in a state opioid abuse goes down because marijuana is a much safer and much more cost-effective alternative to painkillers so that's part of why the drug companies are the single largest donors to politicians they need to protect their monopolies plus they need to keep that war on drugs or otherwise their profits are gonna go down yeah but war on all the wrong kind of drugs but again I'm gonna go back to giving them credit here this finally we're targeting the actual things that are causing the problem which is the prescriptions drugs in the first place help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
