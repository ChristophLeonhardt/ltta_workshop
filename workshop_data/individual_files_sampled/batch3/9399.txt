BRIAN: IT WAS RELATIVELY ABRUPT IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY MORNING AND THE PRESIDENT DECIDED AFTER GETTING UP AND SLEEPING ON IT WEDNESDAY THAT HE WILL NO LONGER BE LOOKING FOR SINGAPORE SUMMIT ON JUNE 12TH. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT, MIGHT BE SEEING HIM AGAIN. SENATOR, I WAS SHOCKED TO GET THAT LETTER. I KNEW THINGS WEREN'T ON THE RIGHT TRACK I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE ON THE WRONG TRACK. WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT. ABOUT 24 HOURS AGO. EVERYBODY WHO IS CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT REGARDING THE LETTER, HOW WELL DID YOU DO IN NORTH KOREA? WE FINALLY GOT A PRESIDENT WHO HAS THEIR ATTENTION. THEY ARE PLAYING THE SAME OLD GAME THEY PLAYED FOR 30 YEARS AND TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO TOLERATE IT I THINK THE LETTER WAS THE RIGHT DECISION. HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE MADE A DECISION EARLY ON WITHIN HIS FIRST 30 DAYS BEING IN OFFICE THAT I'M GOING TO END THE NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD AT LARGE. THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS HOW AND WHEN. IT'S NOT IF, IT'S HOW AND WHEN. HE PREFERS TO DO IT DIPLOMAT LIKELY. WE HOPE TO HAVE A WIN, WIN, WHERE WE SET DOWN WITH NORTH KOREA. WE END THE KOREAN WAR. WE PROVIDE THEM THE SECURITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THEY NEED AND WANT AND THEY GIVE UP THEIR NUKES. BRIAN: THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID, THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL END THIS PROBLEM IN HIS FIRST TERM. IN MY BELIEF HE WILL. IT'S NOT IF HE ENDS THE NORTH KOREAN PROGRAM. IT'S HOW AND. WHEN THERE'S TWO WAYS. DIPLOMACY A WIN, WIN, WHICH IS THE PREFERRED ROUTE, MILITARY CONFLICT THAT WILL DESTROY THE REGIME. WHEN. I THINK HE IS GOING TO DO THIS IN HIS FIRST TERM. HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY I'M NOT GOING TO PASS THIS ON TO ANYBODY ELSE. HE THINKS HE IS GOING TO GET REELECTED, SO DO I. THE ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU THE NORTH KOREANS UNDERSTAND OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM. THEY WAIT EVERY PRESIDENT OUT. THEY ENTER AN AGREEMENT AND THEY BACK OFF AND THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK. THEY ARE TRYING TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK ON TRUMP. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK. TIME IS NOT ON NORTH KOREA'S SIDE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. BRIAN: WHAT'S NEXT? WHAT'S NEXT IS GO BACK TO CHINA WHAT DID YOU DO THAT MEETING ON THE BEACH UNDERCUT EVERYTHING THERE WOULD BE NO NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA WITHOUT CHINA. IS HE GOING TO GO BACK TO CHINA AND READ THEM THE RIOT ACT. IF YOU WANT A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE NORTH KOREAN PROBLEM, HELP ME. IF YOU KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME WE HAVE PLAYED FOR 30 YEARS. THERE IS GOING TO BE A WAR IN YOUR BACKYARD AND NOT OURS. NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO LOSE. THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE A DECISION HE CANNOT TOLERATE A NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA THAT CAN HIT THE HOMELAND WITH A NUCLEAR TIPPED MISSILE THAT THEY WILL SELL WHATEVER THEY BUILD. HE WILL BRING THIS THREAT TO AN END. HE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT THROUGH DIPLOMACY, A WIN-WIN FOR NORTH KOREA, CHINA AT LARGE. IT'S NOT IF THE PROGRAM ENDS, IT'S HOW. I HOPE THROUGH DIPLOMACY THERE WOULD BE NO NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA WITHOUT CHINA'S HELP. THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE PEACE WITHOUT CHINA'S HELP. IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A WAR, IT'S GOING TO END BADLY FOR NORTH KOREA. BRIAN: DO YOU LOOK FOR SANCTIONS TO BE RAMPED UP AND IF CHINA DOES NOT COOPERATE WHAT DO WE DO? IF CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA GOES WOBBLABLY. IN THE WORLD GOES WOBBLABLY ON THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN YOU ARE PUTTING TRUMP IN THE A BOX. THAT'S THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO RIGHT NOW. MAXIMUM PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE. WE WILL TRY TO REENGAGE THE NORTH KOREANS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BEG THEM. THIS IS NOT OBAMA. THIS IS NOT JOHN KERRY. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP. BRIAN: HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN BY PULLING OUT OF THE IRANIAN DEAL. PULLING OUT OF THE PARIS
