and I'm regarded is the hard-hearted MC
and squeeze the clip I will pull Attila
since he when I say declare by him talk
about my mind as far as rappers
parallels like tennis or a tenant are
you ready to be nice ok come on
why did you have to be mean everything
this man can't live on bread alone
Tyler see that as a challenge
mama Papa say fruit vegetables girl cuz
baby give me the balance I've been
trying to work a society
you know first of all your time is up
you're hanging me up
this is like crazy this has like
hey thanks so baby weight all my life is
so crazy or they look at how I said to
down my mother said to when you have a
baby I cannot be lazy I cannot take a
day off they thought I was way off now
they try to make a spin off laid off a
won't be Emma when you had to be in
college there's an FBI slit Abinadi now
I stride like a soldier and I walk with
a stroller
oh this Sun getting older minded body
going solo and nice a supernova but will
you know super saying you did good job
okay Ryan you see your turn now why
won't you love him
so I go away that's fine and in my field
I don't bless your prayer why are you
saying that right because he's talking
me and I don't wanna talk
that's not a reason that's about someone
you need to eat this pesto okay so don't
you want to give some candy okay so each
of fool said you can have some candy
listen you love your brother your
brother loves you and we all love each
other look at me my face okay that's not
nice that you say you don't love your
brother Theo is the delayed rat
what is it delay of gratification yeah
time to kick your Riya what does he like
what is good yeah like he'll take a
lawsuit just so he doesn't have to do
what he he doesn't want to do yeah and
then but he also wants sometimes he
wants the benefits and he doesn't want
to follow the rules right so like
sometimes he'll still be upset that he
doesn't get ice cream or whatever and we
actually never thought we were gonna be
the parents that bribed our kids like
what kind of you know I'm not gonna give
you something if you like that's really
what bad yeah I'm not gonna give you
something you do what you're supposed to
do and then I don't know what happened
no he'll get out of here no you're a
distraction event may have been the
first one to do it but I followed suit
very quickly
because you just can't win every battle
you know what I mean
like they will just go especially when
you're out in public and they want to
act brand new you know what I'm saying
and it's like yo you can act like you
got some sense for a little bit that
I'll give you that a little bit of that
you know and so now basically we become
experts at bribing one of our children
and the other one just takes else will
be taking else are you gonna finish this
or not you are you promise you're
probably gonna finish your food okay and
you promised me no very proud of you
okay I'll be proud of you anyway but
would you say okay so you're not eating
you're in the news right about why it
doesn't matter because okay
don't touch it right
I don't stand there yeah
mom
this is the difference I've been
struggling with strep throat my wife I'm
sick okay
my wife does a horrible job of taking
care of me yes you did a horrible job
what did you doing for me today see
there's a horrible job taking care of me
and then she just goes babe you sound
like the guy from the show i watch
Chicago PD is that the name of the show
Chicago PD and we always make fun of
this kind of voice cuz he sounds
ridiculous I think he got so much for
watching this episode I'm actually a
little bit impressed about urias
self-control he actually has a
conscience he didn't actually go through
with it when he was no wavering back and
forth it's interesting like he's hard to
bribe that kid when he doesn't want to
do something this doesn't want to do it
you know when I feel like I'm learning
each kid specifically them you know on
their own way so that's helping me
helping us figure out how to an over in
motivates kids so anyway thank you so
much for watching
take a latke Network poppy roll the
outro and if you want a longer version
of this video make sure it'll be there
was a lot of you
