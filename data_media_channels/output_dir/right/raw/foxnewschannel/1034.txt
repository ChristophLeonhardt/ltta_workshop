00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,604
MEETINGS ON TUESDAY.

00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:47,607
YOUR EXPECTATIONS FAMILIAR WITH

00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:51,477
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

21
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:52,778
THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD IN

22
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:55,348
WEEKS PAST, CERTAINLY DIFFERENT

23
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:58,117

WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?

27
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:04,590
>> THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP.

28
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,325
I LISTEN TO THE RHETORIC THAT

29
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:07,059
THE PRESIDENT LOSES LEVERAGE A

30
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:10,296
FEW SHAKES HAND WITH KIM JONG

31
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:10,563
UN.

32
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:12,031
I THINK THE SUPREME LEADER WILL

33
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,633
LOSE LEVERAGE BY SHAKING HANDS

34
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:16,936
OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT

35
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:17,703
THREATENING A MILITARY ACTION IF

36
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,438
THIS FALLS APART, IF THIS

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,308
DOESN'T WORK.

38
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:23,075
LISTENING TO LINDSEY GRAHAM'S

39
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:23,809
WORDS ON KEEPING THE MILITARY

40
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:26,545
OPTION ALLIES.

41
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,313
THAT IS FIRED POWER IN ORDER TO

42
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:30,283
MAKE SMART POWER WORK.

43
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,150
THAT WAS CONVEYED TO KIM JONG UN

44
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,720
BY SECRETARY POMPEO IN HIS VISIT

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,454
BY NOW BUT IT LOOKS LIKE, WHAT

46
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,990
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE TO KIM JONG

47
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,192
UN IF WE TOOK THE OPTION.

48
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:42,428
>> SO OFTEN WE'VE HAD EXPERTS ON

49
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:45,531
THE SHOW TALK ABOUT WHAT THE

50
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:48,467
CONVERSATIONS SHOULD LOOK LIKE

51
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:52,605
WHEN THEY SAY THEY WANT COMPLETE

52
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:53,105
DENUCLEARIZATION.

53
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:53,706
DO THEY WANT A MEDIA?

54
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:56,709
DO THEY WANT TO BE PROGRESSIVE

55
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,545
AND HAVE U.S. FORCES OUT OF THE

56
00:01:59,545 --> 00:01:59,979
PENINSULA?

57
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:00,713
IF THINGS DON'T GO ACCORDING TO

58
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:04,050
PLAN, WHAT IS THE BACKUP PLAN?

59
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,686
>> MAXIMUM PRESSURE.

60
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:07,353
ECONOMIC PRESSURE WITH THE

61
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:09,788
MILITARY OPTION ON THE TABLE.

62
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,923
NORTH KOREA WILL ONLY BE AS

63
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:11,657
STRONG AS CHINA AND RUSSIA ALLOW

64
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:17,630
IT TO BE OR BACK IT UP.

65
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,731
TAKING A CUE FROM THE DEMOCRATS,

66
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:20,866
AND THEY SAW HOW WE BE EVERY

67
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:24,804
INDIA WAS AN IEC DEMOCRAT THING

68
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:25,504
THERE SHOULD BE A COMPLETE

69
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:29,041
DISMANTLING OF THE NUCLEAR

70
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:29,842
PROGRAM AND NO INCENTIVES BEFORE

71
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:32,978
THEY'RE TAKEN BY THE SUPREME

72
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:36,615
LEADER AND NO SUNSET CLAUSES.

73
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,217
YOU ALMOST HAVE A UNITED FRONT

74
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:41,987
FOR THE FIRST-TIME MONONUCLEAR

75
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:42,321
PROGRAM.

76
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:43,055
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WANT

77
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,423
TO BE TOUGH HERE IN NORTH KOREA

78
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:47,727
WHICH GIVES THE PRESIDENT

79
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:48,160
LEVERAGE.

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,197
>> WHERE AND HOW DOES CHINA PLAY

81
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:51,530
IN THAT?

82
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,566
WILL WE BE HEARING FROM THEM

83
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:53,999
THIS WEEK?

84
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,968
>> YOU SAW KEY MEETINGS TAKE

85
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,939
PLACE BETWEEN KIM JONG AHEAD OF

86
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,075
THE SUMMIT AND THAT IS TO GIVE

87
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:06,245
SOME LEVERAGE IN THESE MEETINGS.

88
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:06,912
IF THE PRESIDENT WALKS AWAY,

89
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:09,448
THAT IS NOT A BAD THING.

90
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,650
YOU CAN'T MAKE THESE

91
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,051
CONCESSIONS.

92
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:12,918
YOU CAN GIVE THEM WHAT THEY

93
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:13,252
WANTED.

94
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:16,355
THEY WANTED THE EVERY INDIA.

95
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:18,491
IF WE LOST AWAY FROM THE IRAN

96
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,258
DEAL COME WITH A BUS IN LEVERAGE

97
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:21,227
TO NORTH KOREA.

98
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:25,064
LELAND: ON THE HEELS OF THE G-7

99
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:25,898
SUMMIT, CONFIDENT, MORE

100
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:30,569
CONFIDENT, IMPACTFUL AT ALL?

101
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,237
IN THE G-7.

102
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:35,975
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WITHOUT

103
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,543
RUSSIA MAKING CONCESSIONS IN THE

104
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:40,146
AREA, HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN

105
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:42,181
UKRAINE.

106
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:42,681
BUT I AM CANADA.

107
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:47,820
I UNDERSTAND BURKLE AND DEALING

108
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,687
WITH EUROPEAN ALLIES THERE.

109
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,622
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT FOR US IS

110
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:53,559
THE PRESIDENT GET A WIN WITH

111
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,393
NORTH KOREA MAKING CONCESSIONS

112
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,094
TO HAVE SOME DEAL TO BALANCE

113
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:59,932
WITH THE CRITICISM FROM THE G-7

114
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:00,332
SUMMIT.

115
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:01,133
>> FROM THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES,

116
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,668
HOW SURPRISED WOULD YOU BE IF

117
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:03,369
THERE IS MAJOR PROGRESS THAT

118
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:06,372
HAPPENED ON TUESDAY?

119
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,007
>> I THINK THAT THERE'S NOT

120
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,442
MAJOR PROGRESS, CRITICS WILL SAY

121
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:12,111
THIS IS A FAILURE.

122
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:14,079
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE

123
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,781
PRESIDENT TO BE THERE.

124
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:18,384
THE MEETING IS TUESDAY.

125
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:19,351
THERE IS BREATH HAPPENING

126
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:20,351
TOMORROW AND THE PRESIDENT WILL

127
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,120
NOT HAVE THAT HANDSHAKE WITH KIM

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,088
JONG UN IF IT LOOKS ALL FOR SHOW

129
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:27,359
AND IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

130
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,461
I AM CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, BUT

131
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,162
WHAT I WILL NOT DO WAS SUPPORT A

132
00:04:30,162 --> 00:00:00,000
BAD NUCLEAR DEAL WITH NORTH
