[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:01,805 --> 00:00:04,508

00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:07,377
IT'S [BLEEP] TRUMP!

>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.

13
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:21,925
>> Martha: YOU HEARD WHAT

14
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:23,794
HILLARY CLINTON WAS SAYING AND

15
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:24,861
TAPE, WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY THAT

16
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:27,431
SHE SAID THAT THEIR DATA WAS NOT

17
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:28,098
WORKABLE, IT WASN'T WHAT IT

18
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:29,666
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THAT THE

19
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,768
DATA THAT YOU GUYS WERE USING

20
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:33,570
WAS BASICALLY FAKE NEWS AND DATA

21
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,573
MINING THAT SHE THOUGHT WAS

22
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:37,608
QUESTIONABLE.

23
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:38,008
>> YES.

24
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,178
THE THING IS, ONCE OBAMA WON,

25
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:41,945
THEY BECAME COMPLACENT A LITTLE

26
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:42,212
BIT.

27
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:45,249
SO AFTER THAT THEY FORMED THE

28
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:46,350
OFA AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THEY

29
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,018
REALLY KIND OF SPLIT UP

30
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:48,418
EVERYTHING.

31
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:50,120
IN DOING SO THEY REALLY GOT

32
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,155
THEMSELVES BEHIND.

33
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:52,856
SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND IN THE

34
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:53,557
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE

35
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:54,992
GOT AHEAD.

36
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:56,226
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE

37
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:58,195
CHARGE THAT IT WAS FAKE NEWS AND

38
00:00:58,195 --> 00:00:58,762
NEFARIOUS DATA MINING?

39
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:01,565
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S FAKE NEWS.

40
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:03,600
FAKE NEWS AND DATA MINING?

41
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,968
THE DEMOCRATS WERE DEFINITELY

42
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:05,334
BEHIND US.

43
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:09,373
WHAT WE DID IS BUILD UP A

44
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,173
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE

45
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,508
AND VOTER PROFILE THAT YOU HAD

46
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:12,342
AGGREGATE INFORMATION THAT WE

47
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:13,076
COULD USE THAT INFORMATION CAME

48
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:15,712
FROM THE PARTY.

49
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:18,615
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF

50
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:19,249
HOLLYWOOD, THE DEMOCRATIC

51
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:19,950
NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF

52
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,584
CONGRESS ARE TURNING TO

53
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:21,551
HOLLYWOOD TO HELP THEM WITH

54
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:22,786
VOTER TURNOUT AND MESSAGING.

55
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:24,721
THEY HAVE CONFERENCE CALLS WORK

56
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:27,658
ON THEIR EMAIL LIST AND ONE

57
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:29,593
RECENT WEEK MEETING A MIDWESTERN

58
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:33,063
SENATOR THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO

59
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:33,897
ADDRESS GUN-CONTROL WITH

60
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:34,831
CONSERVATIVE LEANING VOTERS IN

61
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,800
HER STATE ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE

62
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,234
PARTICIPANTS.

63
00:01:37,234 --> 00:01:38,602
THEY ARE TRYING TO TALK TO FOLKS

64
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:40,003
IN HOLLYWOOD, DIRECTORS IN

65
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:40,937
HOLLYWOOD, ACTORS ARE ALSO PART

66
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:41,938
OF THIS GROUP AND SAY HOW CAN WE

67
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:44,174
REACH THESE MIDDLE VOTERS AND

68
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:46,410
GET THEM TO NOT VOTE FOR

69
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,010
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

70
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,378
>> I THINK HOLLYWOOD ELITES ARE

71
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:48,779
JUST BEHIND.

72
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:52,582
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAW IN

73
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:53,350
DONALD TRUMP SOMEONE THAT'S WHAT

74
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,885
THEY ARE ABOUT.

75
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:58,822
HE'S THE GUY THAT TAKES SHOWERS

76
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:00,991
AFTER WORK, BEFORE WORK.

77
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,192
THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED.

78
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:02,893
THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE

79
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:05,829
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I THINK

80
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:06,963
AMERICA MOVES ON.

81
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:07,698
DONALD TRUMP AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

82
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:11,735
HAVE CONNECTED WITH THE PEOPLE

83
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:15,005
IN A WAY THAT PREVIOUS HAVE NOT

84
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:15,806
DONE.

85
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:16,540
TRY TO CONNECT WITH HOLLYWOOD,

86
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,409
THEY ARE JUST OUT OF TOUCH.

87
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,411
THE PROBLEM IS DONALD TRUMP IS

88
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,412
COMMUNICATING, THE PEOPLE HE'S

89
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:24,314
MAKING THESE THINGS FOR, THE TAX

90
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,350
CUTS, HE'S MAKING THE AVERAGE

91
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,551
AMERICAN LIFE IN THEIR PERSONAL

92
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,585
ECONOMY AND THE PERSONAL

93
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:29,319
SECURITY IS GETTING BETTER.

94
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,221
LOOK AT WHAT HE DID WITH

95
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:31,621
NORTH KOREA.

96
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,589
>> Martha: IT SO INTERESTING

97
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:34,191
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I HAD

98
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,425
McCARTHY ON, RUNNING FOR MAYOR

99
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,994
IN CHICAGO AND HE'S A DEMOCRAT.

100
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:38,628
HE'S RUNNING AGAINST RAHM

101
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:40,330
EMANUEL, WHO IS ALSO A DEMOCRAT

102
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,066
GARY McCARTHY IS SAYING THERE

103
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:44,134
ARE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO ARE

104
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:47,003
LIKE ME AND HE IS SOMEONE WHO

105
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:48,705
REALLY FINDS HIMSELF MORE IN THE

106
00:02:48,705 --> 00:02:49,773
MIDDLE POLITICALLY BUT THEN

107
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:50,540
YOU'VE GOT ROBERT DE NIRO AS WE

108
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,577
SHOWED YOU THE OTHER NIGHT AT

109
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,545
THE TONY'S WITH THE

110
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:56,980
PROFANITY-LACED TIRADE AGAINST

111
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,382
THE PRESIDENT AND THEN HERE'S

112
00:02:58,382 --> 00:02:59,783
WHAT HE SAID TODAY, WHICH WAS

113
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:00,784
SUPPOSED TO BE SOME SORT OF

114
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:02,686
APOLOGY.

115
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:03,019
WATCH.

116
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,589
>> I WANT TO MAKE A NOTE OF

117
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:06,356
APOLOGY FOR THE IDIOTIC BEHAVIOR

118
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:14,598
OF MY PRESIDENT.

119
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,101
IT'S A DISGRACE AND I APOLOGIZE

120
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,772
TO JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND THE OTHER

121
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:22,272
PEOPLE AT THE G7.

122
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:24,775
IT'S DISGUSTING.

123
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,410
>> Martha: YOUR THOUGHTS?

124
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,012
>> AGAIN, THESE GUYS ARE JUST

125
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:30,380
DISCONNECTED.

126
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,148
DONALD TRUMP IS FIGHTING FOR THE

127
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:33,216
AMERICAN WORKER.

128
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:37,587
CANADA HAS RAISED 270% TARIFFS.

129
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:38,722
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

130
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:39,756
THESE COUNTRIES TAKE ADVANTAGE

131
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:40,524
OF US EVERY DAY AND DONALD TRUMP

132
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,325
IS FIGHTING FOR THEM.

133
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:43,460
AMERICAN TRADE IS ONE OF THE

134
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,161
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE HAVE

135
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,061
AND WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR OUR

136
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:45,395
WORKERS.

137
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:46,496
OUR JOBS HAVE BEEN MOVED

138
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:48,698
OVERSEAS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

139
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:50,500
DOING THE THINGS, HE NEEDS TO

140
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,067
FIGHT AGAINST THESE.

141
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,469
HE'S STANDING UP, HE'S STANDING

142
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,370
STRONG AND THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN

143
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,639
VOTERS HAVE VOTED FOR, SOMEONE

144
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,406
LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD STAND

145
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:56,940
UP TO THEM.

146
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,175
THE HOLLYWOOD ELITES DON'T LIKE

147
00:03:58,175 --> 00:03:59,009
IT.

148
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,043
THEY DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP

149
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:00,410
SUCCESS.

150
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,211
THEY DON'T LIKE SEEING WHAT HAS

151
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,080
HAPPENED IN THE LAST 500, 510

152
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,615
DAYS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO

153
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,083
ANYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE CRAZY

154
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:07,851
COMMENTS TO GET THE STORY OFF TO

155
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,387
SOMETHING ELSE.

156
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:11,922
THEY THINK THEY CAN SHIFT THE

157
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:13,557
STORY AWAY FROM THE SUCCESSES

158
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:14,624
AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE

159
00:04:14,624 --> 00:00:00,000
OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS ARE DOING
