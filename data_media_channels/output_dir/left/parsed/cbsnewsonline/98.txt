HEARD MORE LATER ON AND WE 
HEARD A LOT OF SIRENS AS WELL 
SO FAR THIS MORNING. 
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A 
SERIES OF GUNSHOTS, POTENTIALLY 
SOME THAT -- SOMETHING PROMPTED 
THAT INITIAL POLICE RESPONSE 
THAT YOU SAW THEN HEARD MORE 
SHOTS. 
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SHOT? 
WE HAD DESCRIPTIONS THAT IT WAS 
NOT LIKE A BOOM LIKE A SHOTGUN 
BUT A CRACK, CRACK LIKE A 
HANDGUN OR ASSAULT RIFLE. 
>> I FEEL LIKE IT WAS HANDGUN. 
I'M GUESSING IT WAS WHATEVER 
POLICE CARRY ON THEM. 
IT WAS A CRACK, CRACK, CRACK 
LIKE FOUR IN A ROW. 
AND I COULD HEAR IT REALLY 
CLOSE BECAUSE I KNEW WHERE THEY 
WERE LOCATED BECAUSE I HAD SEEN 
THEM SHOW UP AT THE LOCATION. 
BUT IT WAS A CRACK, CRACK, NOT 
A BIG GUN. 
I DON'T REALLY KNOW GUNS BUT IT 
WAS A CRACK, CRACK. 
>> AGAIN, WERE THEY IN RAPID 
SUCCESSION OR AN EXCHANGE OF 
FIRE BACK AND FORTH WITH A 
DELAY. 
>> THE ONCE I HEARD -- ONES I 
HEARD WERE RAPID. 
>> YOU ARE IN A CHILD CARE 
CENTER. 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN INSTRUCTED 
TO DO AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
>> WE HAVE OUR CENTER ON 
LOCKDOWN. 
WE HAVE A FEW KIDS HERE. 
WE HAVE ABOUT 23 KIDS IN OUR 
CARE CURRENTLY THAT WERE 
DROPPED OFF BEFORE WE WENT ON 
LOCKDOWN BECAUSE WE WERE 
UNAWARE OF HOW SERIOUS THE 
SITUATION WAS IN THE BEGINNING. 
SO, WE ARE NOT HAVING ANYONE 
COME IN OR LEAVE. 
WE HAVE ALL THE DOORS LOCKED 
AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE DO HAVE 
SECURITY DOORS. 
SO, WE HAVE TWO DOORS PROTECTED 
RIGHT NOW. 
SO, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
THE REASON WHY WE DECIDED TO GO 
ON LOCKDOWN AND HOW WE FOUND 
OUT WAS I CALLED THE 
NONEMERGENCY LINE HERE IN 
FREDERICTON AND THE LADY WAS 
VERY URGENT AND TOLD ME TO GO 
ON LOCKDOWN. 
SO, YEAH. 
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 5? 
>> WE HAVE CHILDREN -- WE HAVE 
INFANTS, 2-YEAR-OLD, 3, 4-YEAR-
OLD AND 5-YEAR-OLD AND 6-YEAR-
OLD AND 7-YEAR-OLD HERE TODAY. 
>> HOW ARE THEY DOING? 
>> THEY HAVE NO IDEA, WHICH IS 
GOOD. 
THEY ARE WATCHING A MOVIE. 
THEY THINK IT'S COOL TO HANG 
OUT WITH THEIR SIBLINGS. 
THEY DON'T KNOW OTHERWISE. 
>> THEY ARE DOING FINE. 
AS LONG AS THE MOVIE IS ON. 
HOW ARE YOU DOING? 
THIS MUST BE STRESSFUL? 
>> BEING IN CHARGE, IT IS. 
IT'S SCARY BECAUSE I FEEL 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CHILDREN 
AND THE STAFF. 
AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HOW IT'S FEELING LIKE THE 
MONCTON SHOOTING. 
I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHEN THAT 
HAPPENED. 
SO, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE FEELING 
RIGHT NOW. 
IT'S SCARY THAT IT'S IN OUR 
HOME RIGHT DOWN THE STREET. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
DESCRIBE THE AREA ITSELF. 
BROOKSIDE DRIVE, THE AREA THAT 
IS STILL, AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, 
UNDER THE POLICE LOCK DOWN IS 
MAIN STREET TO RING ROAD. 
THAT IS A LONG AREA. 
THE ACTIVITY BE LIKE AT, SAY, 
7:30 OR 8:00 A.M. 
YOUR TIME WHEN THIS STARTED? 
>> WELL, AT THAT TIME, THAT 
ROAD IS VERY HEAVILY POPULATED. 
THERE IS A LOT OF HOMES AND 
APARTMENTS. 
AND I WAS OUT ON THE ROAD. 
I WENT TO TIM MORE TONS. 
EVERYONE WENT TO TIM HORTON 
BECAUSE THERE IS ONE THERE. 
THINGS ARE SLOWER LATELY 
BECAUSE WE HAVE CONSTRUCTION ON 
RING ROAD, THE HIGHWAY THAT 
PEOPLE TAKE TO GET TO THE SOUTH 
SIDE. 
WE ARE ON THE NORTH SIDE. 
ASSOCIATION IT'S BACKED UP. 
SO, EVERYONE WAS HEADING TO 
WORK. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WALKING TO 
WORK AND BIKING TO WORK. 
IT'S EVERYONE OUT AND ABOUT 
DOING THEIR THING, WALKING 
THEIR DOGS LIKE A TYPICAL 
MORNING. 
THAT IS HOW IT LOOKS WHEN I GO 
TO WORK. 
I LIVE IN THE AREA. 
I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE ABLE 
TO GET HOME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE 
OF THE LOCK DOWN. 
SO THAT'S INTERESTING. 
>> YOU ARE THERE WITH A COUPLE 
OF DOZEN KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 
7 WATCHING A MOVIE AND YOU HAVE 
THE STRESS OF DEALING WITH THE 
SIDEWALKS.
-- DEALING WITH THE SITUATION. 
>> WE HAD A LOT OF PARENTS CALL 
AND CONCERNED WITH THE KIDS 
THAT ARE HERE. 
PARENTS THAT DROPPED OFF AND WE 
HAVE ASSURED THEM THAT WE ARE 
KEEPING THEM SAFE, THEY DON'T 
KNOW ANYTHING. 
FOR THE PARENTS THAT TRIED TO 
DROP OFF WHEN WE WERE ON 
LOCKDOWN, THEY DROVE HOME 
BECAUSE THE AREA, THE FAMILIES 
ALL LIVE IN THE BROOKSIDE DRIVE 
AREA. 
SO, WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS AT 
HOME ON LOCKDOWN WITH THEIR 
CHILDREN. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS THAT 
ARE ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THE 
SITUATION CURRENTLY BECAUSE WE 
HAVE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS 
AS PARENTS HERE. 
SO, WE HAVE A FEW OF THEIR 
KIDDOS. 
SO, IT'S SCARY THAT WE ARE 
AWARE OF SOME POLICE OFFICERS 
THAT ARE DOWN. 
SO, OUR HEARTS ARE KIND OF 
THERE, TOO, I GUESS WITH THEM. 
>> RACHEL, YOU ARE DOING GREAT. 
YOU HAVE THE AND OF A LOT OF 
LITTLE LIVES IN YOUR HANDS. 
YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 
THANK YOU FOR TELLING US WHAT 
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS AND 
INFORMING PEOPLE. 
WE HAVEN'T TOLD PEOPLE WHERE 
YOU ARE OTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE 
CARING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. 
WE ARE EMPHASIZING AGAIN POLICE 
ARE SAYING THAT THEY WANT 
PEOPLE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT 
POSTING ANYTHING ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA. 
DON'T BE TELLING PEOPLE WHERE 
YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU ARE HIDING 
BECAUSE IT IS CLEARLY AN 
ONGOING SITUATION. 
THE SITUATION WITH THE FOUR 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SHOT DEAD 
IN FREDERICTON. 
POLICE ARE COPING WITH THE 
SITUATION THERE WARNING ANYONE 
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE LONG 
STRETCH OF BROOKSIDE TO SHELTER 
IN PLACE. 
OUR THANKS TO RACHEL FOR 
BEARING WITNESS TO WHAT SHE IS 
COPING WITH IN THIS ONGOING 
SITUATION. 
>>> JOINING US NOW, HARRY, HOST 
OF CBC NEWS. 
GOOD TO TALK TO YOU UNDER MOST 
CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THIS IS A 
DIFFICULT SITUATION IN YOUR 
COMMUNITY. 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? 
>> ABSOLUTELY, JOHN. 
THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN FOR 
THE FAMILIES AND EMERGENCY 
RESPONSES WORKERS WHO ARE ON 
THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER 
ACROSS -- DIRECTLY ACROSS RIVER 
FROM DOWNTOWN FREDERICTON. 
THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF 
INCIDENT THIS COMMUNITY IS USED 
TO. 
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET AS 
MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THERE IS A 
LOT MORE WE DON'T KNOW, JOHN. 
WE KNOW THAT THE POLICE HAVE 
CONFIRMED FOUR FATALITIES. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
OF THOSE DEATHS AT ALL YET, 
ONLY THAT THEY TOOK PLACE IN 
THE BROOKSIDE DRIVE AREA. 
THERE IS A SHOPPING MALL THERE 
AND A SMALL COMMUNITY PLAZA. 
IT'S A BUSY PLACE THIS TIME OF 
MORNINGBECAUSE PEOPLE ARE 
TRYING TO GET TO WORK. 
PERHAPS LESS BUSY GIVEN THAT 
IT'S AUGUST AND A LOT OF PEOPLE 
ARE ON VACATION. 
NONETHELESS, THAT AREA, THAT 
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN WARNED 
THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR BUSINESSES 
AND HOMES SHOULD STAY INSIDE, 
LOCK THE DOORS AND HUNKER DOWN 
FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL WE GET 
GREATER CLARITY ON WHAT IS 
GOING ON HERE. 
POLICE ARE DRESSED IN S.W.A.T. 
GEAR SEEN IN THE STREET AND 
BEYOND THAT, WE ARE WAITING FOR 
INFORMATION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. 
>> FOUR PEOPLE KILLED. 
>> YEAH. 
>> HORRIFIC FOR ANY COMMUNITY. 
WE ARE TRYING TO GET A 
DESCRIPTION AND SENSE OF THE 
AREA THIS TAKE PLACE IN. 
IT NORMALLY WOULD BE BUSY AT 
THIS TIME AND QUITE 
RESIDENTIAL? 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
THERE IS A LARGE MALL, THE 
BROOKSIDE MALL AS WELL AS A 
SMALLER MALL DOWN THE STREET 
THAT HAS A TIM HORTON'S. 
HEAVILY POPULATED WITH 
RESIDENTIAL HOUSING. 
NOT THE SORT OF NEIGHBORHOOD 
THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS KIND 
OF THING. 
AT THIS TIME OF DAY MOST PEOPLE 
WOULD BE GETTING READY TO GO TO 
WORK AND GET IN THEIR CARS AND 
BEGIN THE SHORT TREK TO THEIR 
JOBS AND PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE 
TO DO THAT THIS MORNING BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE 
POLICE TO STAY INSIDE THEIR 
HOMES AND AWAIT FURTHER NOTICE. 
WE HAVE JUST APPROACHING THE 
BRIDGE TO THE NORTH SIDE NOW. 
WHERE THERE WOULD NORMALLY BE 
TRAFFIC AT THIS TIME OF THE 
DAY, THE BRIDGE IS PRETTY WELL 
EMPTY. 
AS WE GET CLOSER, I'M SURE WE 
WILL FIND A HEAVIER AND HEAVIER 
POLICE PRESENCE. 
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WAS SAYING 
THAT HE NOTICED A HEAVY POLICE 
PRESENCE THIS MORNING JUST 
AFTER 8:00 WHEN THIS IS 
BELIEVED TO HAVE HAPPENED. 
POLICE ARE SEARCHING THROUGH 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD. 
IT'S BELIEVED DEALER SEARCHING 
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS BEHIND 
THIS, THE NATURE OF THE 
FATALITIES, IF THEY INVOLVE 
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL OR NOT. 
WHAT WILL BE RUNNING THROUGH 
THE MINDS OF MOST PEOPLE IS THE 
TERRIBLE SITUATION THAT 
OCCURRED IN MONKTON, ONE OF THE 
OTHER THREE MAJOR CITIES IN NEW 
BRUNSWICK IN 2014 WHEN OFFICERS 
WERE FATALITIES IN A DIRE 
SITUATION THERE. 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CONCERN. 
THAT WILL BE FOREMOST IN 
PEOPLE'S MINDS AS THEY RESPOND 
TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND 
URGING TO STAY INSIDE AND STAY 
AWAY FROM BROOKSIDE. 
>> YOU SAID THE MONKTON 
INCIDENT AND WE TALKED TO 
WITNESSES RECALLING THAT AND 
DEEP CONCERN ABOUT WHAT IS 
UNFOLDING WHERE YOU ARE. 
WE DO NOT KNOW THE IDENTITIES 
OF THOSE FOUR PEOPLE KILLED. 
WE HAVE TO FAME SIZE THAT AT 
THIS POINT. 
THERE IS AN E TF HERE, 
EMERGENCY S.W.A.T. 
TEAMS. 
RCNP IS NOT THE POLICE FORCE 
FOR THE CITY BUT A PRESENCE IN 
THE AREA. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
THE RCNP ARE THE MUNICIPAL 
POLICE FORCE FOR MANY SMALLER 
COMMUNITIES IN NEW BRUNSWICK. 
THEY WORK WITH THE LARGER 
MUNICIPAL POLICE FORCES IN ST. 
JOHN AND OTHER COMMUNITIES.
YOU CAN BET THEY ARE CON FIRING 
WITH COLLEAGUES WHAT IS -- 
CONFERRING WITH COLLEAGUES WHAT 
IS NEEDED AND WHAT THEY CAN DO 
TO HELP. 
THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IS 
GETTING CLARITY ON WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED HERE TO RESULT IN THE 
FOUR FATALITIES THAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
AND PEOPLE IN THE NORTH SIDE OF 
FREDERICTON WILL BE ANXIOUS TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL BE GOING 
ON AND WHEN THEY WILL BE SAFE 
TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES. 
ON BROOKSIDE DRIVE, THE 
AFFECTED AREA, THERE ARE 
SUBDIVISIONS, THERE ARE 
CONDOMINIUM BUILDINGS AND 
PEOPLE WILL BE HUNKERED DOWN IN 
THEIR HOMES UNTIL THEY GET THE 
ALL CLEAR FROM THE POLICE. 
>> HARRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
HARRY ON THE WAY TO THE SCENE. 
WE WILL REPORT THE LATEST FROM 
HE GETS THERE. 
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
>> I WILL HAVE MORE FOR YOU 
SOON. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THE EMPHASIS FROM THE POLICE 
TO STAY IN PLACE. 
THERE IS AN ONGOING -- 
>> WE WILL PULL AWAY FROM THIS 
LOCAL COVERAGE HERE JUST TO 
BRING YOU UP TO SPEED. 
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS A 
MASS SHOOTING SITUATION THAT IS 
CURRENTLY UNFOLDING IN 
FREDERICTON, NEW BRUNSWICK. 
NEW BRUNSWICK IS IN EASTERN 
PROVINCE, ONE OF THE MARITIME 
PROVINCE IN CANADA. 
IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF 
OR SO FROM THE BORDER TO THE 
NORTH OF MAINE. 
EARLIER TODAY, BETWEEN 7:30, 
ARE 8:00 -- THEY ARE AN HOUR 
AHEAD OF US, GUNSHOTS RANG OUT. 
WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR 
FATALITIES AND THE AREA HAS 
BEEN BLOCKED OFF. 
POLICE BLOCKED OFF THE AREA. 
THEY TOLD PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING 
IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOSTLY A 
RESIDENTIAL AREA TO STAY IN 
THEIR HOMES. 
THEY ARE ASKING EVERYONE ELSE 
TO AVOID THE AREA. 
THIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE 
SITUATION. 
THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN AN ARMORED 
TRUCK. 
THE LOCAL REPORTER ON THE SCENE 
SAYS THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS OF 
THE S.W.A.T. 
TEAM THERE. 
SOME HAVE ASSAULT RIFLES. 
SHE SAYS THAT THEY ARE -- 
POLICE ARE HELPING PEOPLE GET 
OUT OF THE AREA. 
THEY ARE WALKING PEOPLE OUT OF 
THE AREA. 
POLICE ARE ASKING PEOPLE OUT 
THERE WHO ARE SHARING 
INFORMATION NOT TO TWEET OUT OR 
POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR SHARE 
IN ANY WAY THEIR LOCATION, 
S.W.A.T. 
TEAM LOCATION, FIRST RESPONDER 
LOCATION. 
THEY DO 0 NOT WANT -- THEY DO 
NOT WANT THAT INFORMATION 
DISSEMINATED IN THE PUBLIC 
OFFICER. 
PAUL VIOLLIS IS STANDING BY. 
YOU ARE A SECURITY ANALYST. 
SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING ALLOWED 
TO LEAVE THE AREA. 
POLICE ARE ESCORTING THEM OUT. 
THEY HAVE A S.W.A.T. 
TEAM THERE, AN ARMORED VEHICLE 
THERE, WHAT CAN YOU SORT OF 
GIVE ME BASED ON THE 
INFORMATION THAT WE KNOW SO FAR 
ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE UNFOLDING. 
>> BASED AGAIN ON THE GREAT 
FOOTAGE WE ARE GETTING FROM 
CBSN ONLINE SHOWING THE PICTURE 
OF THE SCENE RIGHT NOW, CLEARLY 
THEY HAVE AN OUTER PERIMETER 
AND INNER PERIMETER. 
THEY ARE REMOVING PEOPLE FROM 
THEIR HOMES WHICH MEANS THAT 
THEY HAVE NARROWED DOWN WHERE A 
SHOOTER IS OR SHOOTERS. 
IF NOT HAVE ALREADY MITIGATED 
THE RISK. 
NOW THEY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND 
WHAT IS A DANGER ZONE AND WHAT 
IS OUTSIDE THE DANGER ZONE. 
OUTSIDE THE DANGER ZONE, THEY 
WILL EVACUATE. 
ALL OF THESE ARE ARE GOOD SIGNS 
FOR THE GENERAL PUCK LIKE. 
THAT IS TELLING US THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT HAS GUN TO CONTAIN 
IF NOT ALREADY CONTAINED THE 
SITUATION AND THEY ARE 
BEGINNING TO CLEANSE IT. 
>> THAT IS GOOD NEWS. 
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS 
GOING ON HERE. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS SIMPLY 
A DOMESTIC SITUATION BECAUSE 
IT'S IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA OR 
IF IT HAS LARGER, BROADER 
IMPLICATIONS. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY 
CHANCES. 
WE REMEMBER IN TORONTO NOT TOO 
LONG AGO THERE WAS A MASS 
SHOOTING THERE. 
A SINGLE SHOOTING IN THE 
DANFORTH AREA RANDOMLY SHOOTING 
PEOPLE. 
THE FAMILY SAID IT HAD NOTHING 
TO DO WITH A TERRORIST ATTACK. 
HE WAS SEVERELY ILL. 
WHEN WE SEE THESE MASS 
SHOOTINGS WE WANT TO PAY 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO IT 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW 
THINGS WILL UNFOLD. 
PAUL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR INPUT AND EXPERTISE. 
YOU ARE ALWAYS HERE WHEN WE 
NEED IT. 
FOR EVERYONE ELSE WE WILL DIP 
BACK IN TO THE LOCAL CBC 
COVERAGE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD, THIS LONG STRETCH 
OF BROOKSIDE. 
>> THE AREA THAT WE ARE IN IS A 
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. 
THERE ARE LOTS OF HOMES WITH 
ATTACHED GARAGES. 
THERE ARE APARTMENT BUILDINGS. 
IT LOOKED LIKE A FAMILY 
ORIENTED AREA IN FREDERICTON. 
>> SO, AN AREA WHERE AT THAT 
HOUR, AGAIN, EARLY IN THE 
MORNING, YOU WOULD HAVE PEOPLE 
HEADING TO WORK, SENDING KIDS 
TO SCHOOL AND GOING FOR COFFEE, 
RIGHT? 
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THIS IS AN 
AREA WHERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN GOING ABOUT THEIR REGULAR 
DAY. 
THAT CHANGED SUDDENLY THIS 
MORNING. 
>> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE -- 
WE CAN'T BE SPECIFIC ABOUT 
POLICE AND WHERE THEY ARE OR 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, BUT THIS 
WOULD OBVIOUSY BE A FULL COURT 
PRESS FOR THE POLICE IN 
FREDERICTON AND IN A POSITION 
TO BRING IN THE RCNP IN THE 
INVESTIGATION AS WELL. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT ASSETS 
ARE THERE ON THE GROUND IN 
TERMS OF POLICE PRESENCE? 
>> THERE IS A LARGE POLICE 
PRESENCE. 
WHILE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE 
SPECIFICS OF WHERE THEY ARE AND 
WHAT THEY HAVE, THERE IS A 
LARGE POLICE PRESENCE ON SCENE 
AS WELL AS FIRE DEPARTMENTS. 
THERE WAS AN AMBULANCE HERE BUT 
IT HAS SINCE LEFT THE SCENE. 
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A 
VERY LARGE POLICE PRESENCE. 
>> AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT 
VIDEO THAT YOU SENT IN WITH THE 
FIRE TRUCK THERE AND AMBULANCE 
AS WELL. 
>> NATALIE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
REPORTING. 
ELIZABETH HAMPTON LIVES NEAR 
THE SCENE. 
THIS IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 
I THOUGHT I HEARD FOUR. 
I THOUGHT THESE WOULD HAVE BEEN 
THE ONES I HEARD ABOUT 20 AFTER 
8:00. 
I THOUGHT THEY SOUNDED LIKE 
POLICE CARS THAN ANYTHING ELSE. 
THE ONLY KIND OF SHOTS I'M USED 
TO HEARING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD 
ARE DURING HUNTING SEASON. 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD 
COMPARE THEM WITH AND THEY 
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THAT. 
>> YOU ARE SAYING IT WAS RATHER 
NOT A BOOM LIKE A SHOTGUN BUT A 
CRACK CRACK. 
>> NOT RAPID. 
A TIME BETWEEN THEM. 
>> LIKE THEY WERE COMING FROM 
TWO DIRECTIONS? 
>> NO, ONE AREA. 
THE AREA THAT IS SOMEWHAT WEST 
OF WHERE I AM WHICH WOULD BE 
THE AREA AROUND THE BROOKSIDE 
MALL. 
RING ROAD, THIS AREA WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT, WE ARE SHOWING A 
MAP. 
IT'S A LONG STRETCH OF ROAD. 
>> WHEN YOU COME UP FROM MAIN 
STREET, THE AREA BLOCKED OFF 
STARTS WELL ON MAIN STREET AND 
BEHIND THAT AREA IS A LARGE 
SUMMER MARKET. 
ON ONE -- SUPERMARKET. 
ON ONE SIDE THERE IS A GAS 
STATION. 
THE REST OF IT IS RESIDENTIAL.
IT GOES UP TO A STREET WITH 
DOUGLAS AVENUE AND THERE IS A 
FUNERAL HOME AND A SMALL 
SHOPPING PLAZA. 
THEN YOU REACH RING ROAD. 
RING ROAD IS -- CONNECTS THE 
OUTLYING AREAS OF FREDERICTON 
WITH FREDERICTON ITSELF AND 
CONTINUES ON TO THE DOWNTOWN. 
SO, ONCE YOU PASS RING ROAD YOU 
ARE IN AN AREA WITH A SMALL 
AMOUNT OF SHOPPING AND THEN 
RESIDENTIAL. 
THE SMALL AMOUNT OF SHOPPING 
INCLUDES SOME PLACES. 
>> SHE SPOKE TO US A FEW 
MOMENTS AGO. 
LET'S TALK TO MEGHAN ROBERTS. 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR US? 
>> WE ARE TRYING TO PIECE 
TOGETHER A POTENTIAL TIMELINE. 
WE ARE RELYING ON THE POLICE 
AND ON WITNESSES. 
THIS IS A POTENTIAL TIMELINE, 
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PIECE 
TOGETHER BASED ON WHAT WE ARE 
HEARING. 
THE FIRST SHOTS ACCORDING TO 
THE WITNESSES WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
AND SEEN FOR OUR WIRE SERVICE 
THAT WE SUBSCRIBE TO, THE 
EARLIEST SHOTS JUST AFTER 7:00 
A.M. 
PEOPLE HEARD SHOTS UP UNTIL A 
QUARTER TO 8 AND 8:00. 
SO AFTER 7:00 TO 8:00 SOMEWHERE 
IN THAT AREA IS WHEN WE HEARD 
THE FIRST SHOTS. 
AROUND THAT IS WHEN POLICE SENT 
OUT THE FIRST TWEET. 
THEY SENT THAT TWEET OUT JUST 
BEFORE 8:00 A.M. 
LOCAL TIME. 
YOU CAN SEE THE TIMESTAMP ON 
YOUR SCREEN THERE. 
THAT IS A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE. 
THIS HAPPENED BEFORE 8:00 A.M. 
LOCAL FREDERICK TON TIME SAYING 
AVOID THAT AREA BETWEEN MAIN 
AND RING ROAD WITH CONFIRMING 
AN INCIDENT THAT RESULTED IN 
FOUR PEOPLE KILLED, MORE 
INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE 
WHEN WE CAN CONFIRM. 
THE OTHER THING WE ARE GETTING 
INFORMATION FROM, THAT IS THE 
AREA THAT THIS IS HAPPENING, 
YOU CAN SEE HOW BIG IT IS, HOW 
MUCH IS BLOCKED OFF AND HOW 
MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED. 
SUCH A BIG CHUNK OF ROAD. 
ANOTHER THING WE ARE HEARING IS 
CONFLICTING REPORTS ABOUT IS 
THE NUMBER OF SHOTS. 
WE HEARD ONE WITNESS SAYING SHE 
HEARD FOUR SHOTS. 
ANOTHER SAID HE COULD HAVE 
HEARD UP TO 17 SHOTS FIRED. 
SO, WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY 
SHOTS WERE FIRED AT THIS POINT. 
WE ARE GETTING A BROAD RANGE OF 
SHOTS ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESSES 
AT THE SCENE. 
LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF THOSE 
EYEWITNESSES DESCRIBING WHAT 
SHE HEARD. 
WE ARE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER 
THE TIMELINE. 
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE 
GROUND. 
WE ARE USING INFORMATION FROM 
THE POLICE ON TWITTER. 
THAT IS ONE OF THE SOURCES THEY 
ARE SAYING FOR PEOPLE TO TURN 
TO. 
GO ONLINE AND TURN TO THE 
TWITTER ACCOUNT AND SEE THE 
MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY POSTED 
IS THANKING PEOPLE FOR THEIR 
PATIENCE.
THE OTHER THING THAT POLICE ARE 
STRESSING NOW IS DO NOT POST 
YOUR LOCATION OR ANYTHING GOING 
ON IN YOUR LOCATION ONLINE. 
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. 
THIS IS AN ONGOING INCIDENT 
RIGHT NOW AND POLICE ARE DOING 
TACTICAL THINGS AND THEY DON'T 
WANT ANYONE TO KNOW WHERE THEY 
ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING. 
THAT'S ANOTHER THING WE HAVE 
BEEN STRESSING, DO NOT POST 
YOUR LOCATION ONLINE. 
THE BROOKSIDE DRIVE AREA, MORE 
THAN 20 KIDS ARE UNDER LOCK 
DOWN AT A DAY CARE CENTER. 
WE WON'T TELL YOU WHERE. 
RACHEL IS WATCHING OVER THEM AT 
THE CENTER. 
SHE TOLD US THIS MORNING HOW 
THEY ARE DOING. 
>> WE HAVE INFANTS, 2, 3, 4-
YEAR-OLD AND 5 YEARS OLD AND 6-
YEAR-OLD AND 7-YEAR-OLD HERE 
úT 
WE HAVE OUR KERN ON LOCKDOWN. 
WE HAVE A FEW -- CENTER ON 
LOCKDOWN. 
WE HAVE ABOUT 23 KIDS IN OUR 
CARE CURRENTLY THAT WERE 
DROPPED OFF BEFORE WE WENT ON 
LOCKDOWN BECAUSE WE WERE 
UNAWARE OF HOW SERIOUS -- 
>> WE WILL INTERRUPT THAT TO GO 
TO BRETT WHO HAS MORE BREAKING 
NEWS. 
>> THIS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 
ONE MINUTE. 
FREDERICTON POLICE TWEETED THEY 
HAVE ONE SUSPECT IN CUSTODY AT 
THIS TIME. 
THIS COMES DIRECTLY FROM 
FREDERICTON POLICE TWEETING ON 
THE TWITTER FEED THEY HAVE ONE 
SUSPECT IN CUSTODY IN RELATION 
TO THIS SHOOTING. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE THIS 
PERSON WAS FOUND, WHERE THE 
PERSON WAS ARRESTED, WHETHER 
IT'S A MAN OR WOMAN BUT WE KNOW 
FROM POLICE THAT ONE PERSON HAS 
BEEN ARRESTED AT THIS POINT. 
THE POLICE ARE CALLING THEM A 
SUSPECT IN THIS SHOOTING. 
THE LOCK DOWN, THE HOLD IN 
PLACE SITUATION IS STILL IN 
PLACE AS WELL. 
PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING TOLD TO 
REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES, KEEP 
DOORS LOCKED AS WELL. 
WE DO KNOW AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE 
MORNING WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE KILLED IN 
THIS SHOOTING. 
WE KNOW THAT FREDERICTON POLICE 
ARRESTED ONE SUSPECT IN THIS 
SITUATION. 
JOHN? 
>> THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE IN 
THE SAME RELEASE POLICE ARE 
SAYING FOR THE FORESEEABLE 
FUTURE THE AREA WILL BE ON 
LOCKDOWN. 
WE ARE TRYING TO PAINT A 
PICTURE ABOUT THAT. 
WE HAVE HEAVILY ARMED POLICE, 
ONE SUSPECT, THERE COULD BE 
MORE, WE DON'T KNOW. 
THE IDEA THAT THIS AREA STILL 
REMAINS UNDER LOCK DOWN AS 
POLICE O THEIR JOB. 
>> YOU GOT TO PUT YOURSELF IN 
THE SHOWS, IN THE SITUATION 
THAT PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN. 
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE, IF YOU 
ARE WATCHING THIS, WHEREVER YOU 
ARE WATCHING THIS, TO BE TOLD 
TO LOCK THE DOORS, STAY WHERE 
YOU ARE, YOU ARE STUCK THERE, 
YOU CANNOT LEAVE. 
WE HEARD THE SITUATION OF THE 
DAY CARE WITH THE 23 CHILDREN 
INSIDE AND THE SITUATION THAT 
-- THE MENTALITY OF THE PARENTS 
THAT MAY HAVE JUST DROPPED OFF 
THEIR KIDS OR HEADING TO WORK 
AND HEARD THAT THE KIDS WERE IN 
THIS DAY CARE SAFE WITH THE TWO 
DOORS AS WE HEARD, SECURITY 
DOORS LOCKED UP WITH THE KIDS 
WATCHING THE MOVIE BUT THE 
THOUGHT THAT YOU CAN'T GET BACK 
TO YOUR KIDS. 
YOU CAN'T GET TO YOUR FAMILY 
MEMBERS BECAUSE OF THIS LOCK 
DOWN THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR 
AT LEAST AN HOUR AND A HALF OR 
SO SINCE THE NEWS FIRST BROKE 
OF THE SHOOTING IN THE 
FREDERICTON AREA. 
THIS IS AFFECTING A LARGE AREA 
OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CITY. 
BROOKSIDE BETWEEN MAIN STREET 
AND RING ROAD HAS BEEN LOCKED 
DOWN FOR 90 MINUTES OR SO SINCE 
THE FIRST SHOTS WERE REPORTED. 
WE ARE HEARING ACCOUNTS OF 
PEOPLE THAT HEARD THE GUNSHOTS. 
FREDERICTON POLICE SAID THERE 
WERE FOUR PEOPLE KILLED AS A 
RESULT OF THIS SHOOTING. 
AND THE LATEST BREAKING NEWS 
THAT WE HAVE IS THAT ONE 
SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY, ARRESTED 
BY FREDERICTON POLICE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE 
ARRESTED, WHETHER IT WAS IN 
THAT AREA THAT WAS LOCKED DOWN 
OR ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE IDENTITY OF 
THEM EITHER BUT ONE SUSPECT IS 
NOW IN CUSTODY. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF POLICE ARE 
LOOKING FOR ANY OTHER SUSPECTS 
BUT THEY ARE ADVISING PEOPLE TO 
REMAIN LOCKED DOWN. 
STAY IN YOUR HOMES IF THEY ARE 
LIVING IN THE BROOKSIDE DRIVE 
AREA WITH THE DOORS AND WINDOWS 
LOCKED. 
JOHN? 
>> THAT IS A COUPLE OF KEY 
POINTS THERE, NOT ONLY STAYING 
INSIDE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY BUT 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLICE 
EMPHASIS ON THE PUBLIC'S 
ABILITY OR POTENTIAL LILAC 
THERE OF TO SEND OUT 
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY MAY 
BE SEEING. 
WE LIVE IN AN AREA OF SOCIAL 
MEDIA WHERE THIS INFORMATION 
CAN BE QUICKLY ACCESSED. 
TELL US ABOUT THAT, THE WARNING 
TO PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE ASKED 
NOT TO PUT OUT THERE. 
>> THIS GOES WITH ANY EMERGENCY 
SITUATION THAT IS HAPPENING, 
ANY DEVELOPING SITUATION THAT 
MAY BE OCCURRING, IF YOU SEE 
POLICE ACTIVITY OR PERHAPS 
POLICE RUNNING THROUGH YOUR 
BACKYARD, EVEN IF YOU GRAB A 
PHOTO OR VIDEO, DON'T TWEET IT, 
DON'T SHARE POLICE MOVEMENTS OR 
ACTIVITIES BECAUSE EVERYONE IS 
ON SOCIAL MEDIA. 
THAT COULD INCLUDE POSSIBLE 
SUSPECTS IN AN EMERGENCY 
SITUATION SUCH AS THIS ONE. 
SO, FREDERICTON POLICE TWEETED 
IT. 
IT'S NOT JUST US SAYING IT. 
IT'S FREDERICTON POLICE ASKING 
RESIDENTS IN THIS AREA WHO 
MIGHT SEE DEVELOPMENTS 
HAPPENING IN THEIR VICINITY NOT 
TO SHARE THOSE DEVELOPMENTS AND 
INFORMATION ONLINE FOR THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY AND 
INTEGRITY OF THE OPERATION AND 
THE OFFICERS INVOLVED WHO ARE 
INVESTIGATING THIS SITUATION. 
AGAIN, THE OFFICERS INVOLVED 
ARE BOTH THOSE WHO ARE WEARING 
CONVENTIONAL POLICE UNIFORMS 
WITH THEIR FAIRLY LIGHTWEIGHT 
SECURITY VESTS AS WELL AS THOSE 
THAT ARE CALLED THE EMERGENCY 
TASK FORCE S.W.A.T. 
úTEAM, DIFF 
DIFFERENT CITIES BUT THE 
HEAVILY ARMORED POLICE. 
THE HEAVILY ARMED POLICE ARE ON 
SCENE WITH THEIR ARMORED 
VEHICLES AS WELL. 
WE ARE SEEING SOME IMAGES THAT 
HAVE BEEN POSTED ONLINE, 
GENERIC ONES THAT ARE SHOWING 
NOT ONLY POLICE VEHICLES BUT 
AMBULANCES, TOO. 
MULTIPLE AMBULANCES ON SCENE AT 
THE MOMENT. 
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A FULL 
REONSE IN THE FREDERICTON 
AREA TO THIS ONE PART OF THE 
NORTH END AS A RESULT OF THIS 
SHOOTING THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES 
OF FOUR PEOPLE AND LED TO ONE 
PERSON BEING ARRESTED AND THAT 
SUSPECT IS IN POLICE CUSTODY. 
>> THANKS AGAIN. 
WE WILL TALK SOON. 
WE HAVE ANOTHER LOCAL RESIDENT 
JOINING US. 
ROBERT LIVES IN THE AREA. 
HE TOO HEARD THE SHOTS. 
ROBERT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING 
US, WHAT DID YOU HEAR? 
>> AROUND 7:00 THIS MORNING I 
HEARD WHAT I THOUGHT WERE 
FIRECRACKERS INITIALLY. 
LIKE A BANG, FOLLOWED BY A 
BANG, BANG, BANG AND RAPID FIRE 
THEN ANOTHER BANG. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PECULIARIZE 
QUEENS, THEN A FEW MOMENTS 
úLAT 
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS THAT I 
WAS HEARING AND I HEARD IT 
AGAIN, MUCH LOUDER. 
I CONCLUDED IT WAS GUNSHOTS BUT 
I WASN'T SURE AT THAT POINT. 
>> SO, THE SITUATION YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT HERE, ANYWAY YOU 
COULD COUNT OR QUALIFY THE 
NUMBER OF SHOTS THAT YOU HEARD? 
WELL, IN TOTAL, MAYBE OVER A 15-
MINUTE PERIOD I WOULD ESTIMATE 
LIKE 15. 
THEN ROUGHLY -- THEY ALL 
SOUNDED THE SAME, LIKE THE SAME 
FREQUENCY, SAME SORT OF SOUND. 
THEN ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES LATER I 
HEARD A LOUD SOUND THAT HAD A 
MUCH DIFFERENT PITCH. 
I THOUGHT IT WATTS A RIFLE BUT 
I DON'T KNOW -- WAS A RIFLE BUT 
I DON'T KNOW. 
>> WAS THERE A SENSE THAT IT 
WAS A BACK ANT FORTH OR A 
SINGLE INDIVIDUAL SHOOTING IN A 
PARTICULAR DIRECTION? 
>> I REALLY DON'T KNOW. 
ALL I COULD HEAR WAS THE 
SEQUENCE LIKE A BANG, BANG, 
BANG LIKE I DESCRIBED EARLIER. 
A FEW MINUTES LATER I HEARD THE 
VARIOUS SIRENS, THAT'S ABOUT 
ALL I KNOW. 
>> WHAT IS THE SITUATION WHERE 
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? 
>> WE ARE ALL INSIDE THE HOMES. 
NEIGHBORS ARE TEXTING WITH ONE 
ANOTHER. 
EVERYBODY IS SORT OF CONCERNED, 
I GUESS. 
THERE IS POLICE OBVIOUSLY 
VISIBLE, ARMORED VEHICLES, 
STREETS ARE CONCERNED. 
THERE ARE POLICE BLOCKING THE 
STREETS TO AND FROM. 
I GUESS EVERYBODY IS ON EDGE. 
>> THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, A LONG 
STRETCH OF ROAD CORDONED OFF. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT 
NORMALLY ON A FRIDAY MORNING, 
7:00, 7:30 IN THE MORNING WOULD 
BE GOING ON IN THAT 
NEIGHBORHOOD? 
>> I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF, 
I WOULD BE WALKING THE DOG, 
DRINKING A COFFEE AND SMELLING 
THE ROSES, COMPLETELY SAFE, 
COMFORTABLE DAY AND NIGHT QUITE 
FRANKLY. 
>> WE CAN'T TALK SPECIFICS 
ABOUT THE POLICE ACTIVITY BUT 
THERE IS A FULL COURT PRESS? 
SIGNIFICANT POLICE PRESENCE ON 
THE STREETS? 
>> THERE IS. 
A COMBINATION OF RCNP AND THE 
LOCAL CITY POLICE. 
VERY IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH. 
THEY ARE EVACUATING SOME 
PREMISES. 
YOU CAN SEE THIS FROM MY 
PICTURE WINDOW. 
IT'S AMAZING TO WATCH AS THEY 
ARE EVACUATING PEOPLE. 
THE POLICE ARE PUTTING 
THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE AREA 
WHERE THE -- PRESUMABLY THE 
SHOOTER IS AND WHERE THEY ARE 
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO SAFETY. 
THEY ARE ACTING AS A SHIELD AS 
PEOPLE LEAVE THE AREA. 
IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH. 
>> WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH POLICE 
AS THEY CONTINUE TO GIVE 
DIRECTTISTS TO PEOPLE AND THE 
-- DIRECTIVES TO PEOPLE AND THE 
ARREST OF A SUSPECT. 
WHAT IS IT IN TERMS OF YOUR DAY 
AND THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO THAT 
YOU ARE GOING TO DO THERE WITH 
YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR HOUSE? 
>> WE ARE JUST -- WE ARE 
FEELING ANXIOUS AND SAFE. 
I THINK EVERYBODY WONDERS IF WE 
WILL GET TO WORK AT SOME POINT 
WHEN THEY OPEN THE STREETS UP. 
IT'S SURREAL. 
WE ARE COMFORTING ONE ANOTHER, 
WATCHING THE NEWS TRYING TO 
LEARN WHAT IS GOING ON AND 
WAITING TO GET WORD FROM THE 
AUTHORITIES THAT IT'S SAFE TO 
LEAVE AND JUST TRYING TO 
COMFORT ONE ANOTHR. 
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO TRY 
TO COMFORT ONE ANOTHER? 
>> JUST THAT THEY ARE POLICE 
AROUND. 
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. 
FOR US TO JUST KEEP OUR WITS 
ABOUT US, BE STAYING INSIDE THE 
HOME, KEEP THE DOORS LOCKED AND 
JUST NOT DO ANYTHING STUPID. 
WE ARE REMINDING OURSELVES OF 
THAT AND IN A WAY, A LOT OF 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE CALLING 
IN IN VARIOUS FORMS AS WELL. 
THAT IS A DISTRACTION TALKING 
ABOUT IT WITH THEM, NOT JUST 
LOOKING OUT THE PICTURE WINDOW 
AND OBSERVING THE ACTIVITY. 
>> POLICE ARE EMPHASIZING 
%-ú 
PICTURE WINDOWS. 
LIVE FIRE SCENARIO AND BULLETS 
HAVE NO CONSCIOUS AND COULD END 
UPCOMING THROUGH WINDOWS. 
A REMINDER TO STAY AWAY FROM 
WINDOWS AND KEEP DOORS AND 
WINDOWS LOCKED. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
ALL THE BEST TO YOUR AND YOUR 
FAMILY.

THEY SAY THEY HEARD GUNFIRE FOR 
OVER AN HOUR. 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS ON

POLICE ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO 
STAY AWAY FROM THE AREA. 
JOINING US AS HE HAS BEEN FROM 
THE BEGINNING, BRETT RUSKIN. 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 
STORY. 
>> IT'S CONTINUING TO DEVELOP 
MINUTE BY MINUTE. 
THE LATEST BREAKING NEWS THAT 
WE HEARD, ONE SUSPECT IS IN 
CUSTODY AS A RESULT OF THIS 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 
WE KNOW FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED 
FROM THIS SHOOTING. 
POLICE HAVE BEEN ON SCENE IN 
THE BROOKSIDE DRIVE AREA, THE 
NORTH SIDE OF FREDERICTON ALL 
MORNING LONG. 
SO, THE SITUATION THERE IS THAT 
HOMES, BUSINESSES, OFFICES ARE 
ON LOCKDOWN AT THIS HOUR. 
PEOPLE CAN'T COME, THEY CAN'T 
GO. 
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR DOORS 
AND WINDOWS LOCKED. 
THERE IS AN EXCEPTION. 
POLICE ARE ESCORTING SOME 
PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES TO 
SAFETY IN SOME SIDEWALKS. 
THAT IS COMING FROM NATALIE, 
SHE IS ON SCENE AT THIS TIME. 
BUT THE LOCK DOWN IS IN PLACE. 
THAT NEWS OF THE LOCK DOWN 
STILL REMAINING IN EFFECT COMES 
ALONGSIDE THE NEWS THAT 
FREDERICTON POLICE DID ARREST 
ONE SUSPECT IN RELATION TO THE 
ONGOING INCIDENT. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE SUSPECT 
WAS ARRESTED IN THE BROOKSIDE 
AREA, ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY, 
WHO THE SUSPECT WAS. 
WE KNOW THAT ONE PERSON HAS 
BEEN ARRESTED. 
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW IF POLICE 
ARE SEARCHING FOR OTHER 
SUSPECTS IN THIS INVESTIGATION. 
THE WE KNOW FOUR PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED AS A RESULT OF THIS 
SHOOTING THAT BEGAN A NUMBER OF 
HOURS AGO, TWO TO THREE HOURS 
AGO. 
WE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE 
RESIDENTS THAT EXPERIENCED THE 
EFFECTS OF THE LOCK DOWN, NOT 
ONLY BROOKSIDE BUT THE 
SURROUNDING STREETS AS WELL. 
IT'S QUITE A LENGTHY AREA. 
NOT ONE OR TWO BLOCKS BUT A 
LONG STRETCH OF RESIDENTIAL 
ROADWAY WITH LOTS OF HOMES AND 
SMALL BUSINESSES THERE. 
WE HEARD IN PARTICULAR PEOPLE 
BEING LOCKED DOWN IN TIM 
HORTON'S. 
PEOPLE LOCKED DOWN WITH KIDS IN 
A DAY CARE. 
23 CHILDREN IN ONE DAY CARE WHO 
ARE THERE WATCHING A MOVIE BUT 
THE STAFF ENSURED THAT THE 
SECURITY DOORS WERE LOCKED AND 
COMMUNICATING WITH PARENTS THAT 
COULDN'T GET TO THEIR KIDS. 
THEY PERHAPS HAD JUST DROPPED 
THEM OFF AND WERE WAITING 
OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF THE 
LOCKED DOWN AREA WHILE THE KIDS 
WERE INSIDE. 
IT IS A LARGE STRETCH OF AREA 
THAT IS CURRENTLY LOCKED DOWN 
STILL IN FREDERICK TON. 
POLICE ARE ADVISING PEOPLE TO 
STAY INDOORS, KEEP THE DOORS 
AND WINDOWS LOCKED UNLESS 
POLICE COME TO YOUR DOOR AND 
OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE 
ESCORTED TO SAFETY. 
>> BRETT, AS YOU WERE TALKING 
ABOUT, NATALIE WAS SENDING IN 
VIDEO. 
YOU CAN SEE WHAT SHE IS 
DESCRIBING TO US, AT LEAST 
WHERE SHE IS, WE ARE NOT 
REVEALING THE LOCATION, BUT IT 
APPEARS TO BE ONE END OF THE 
ACTIVITY. 
THERE IS SOME SENSE OF CALM BUT 
HEAVILY ARMED POLICE OFFICERS 
AND EMERGENCY TASK FORCE, THEY 
ARE ALL ON THE SCENE. 
SO, BRETT, YOU WERE TALKING 
ABOUT THE SUSPECT. 
AS YOU EMPHASIZE, WE DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THE SUSPECT WAS ARRESTED. 
THE OTHER ASPECT, DESPITE THE 
ARREST OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN THIS 
CASE AND WHO THIS PERSON IS AND 
WHY THEY WERE ARRESTED, WE 
DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT BUT 
POLICE ARE CALLING THIS AN 
ONGOING SITUATION IN TERMS OF 
THE PUBLIC'S NEED TO STAY AND 
SHELTER IN PLACE. 
>> STILL ONGOING SITUATION 
INDEED. 
THIS IS A LOOK AT THE SHORT 
VIDEO THAT WE HAVE FROM ONE 
PART OF THIS LOCK DOWN AREA. 
WE KNOW THERE IS A HUGE 
RESPONSE FROM EMERGENCY 
OFFICIALS. 
THERE WERE CONVENTIONALLY 
CLOSED POLICE OFFICERS WITH THE 
REGULAR UNIFORMS, WITH 
CONVENTIONAL SECURITY AND 
BULLETPROOF VESTS AND THERE 
WERE THE HEAVILY ARMED AND 
HEAVILY ARMORED POLICE OFFICERS 
CALLED EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM 
OR S.W.A.T. 
TEAM, DIFFERENT NAMES FOR 
DIFFERENT CITIES. 
THEY ARRIVED AFTER THE SHOTS 
WERE FIRED WITH THEIR HEAVILY 
ARMORED VEHICLES AS WELL. 
THEY ARRIVED TO SECURE THE 
AREA, TO SEARCH THROUGH THE 
AREA AS WELL. 
WE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS 
WITNESSES ABOUT POLICE OFFICERS 
WALKING THROUGH PATROLLING, 
RUNNING THROUGH THE AREA AS 
WELL. 
THE LATEST TWEET, 19 MINUTES 
AGO FROM FREDERICTON POLICE, 
THEY HAVE ONE SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY AND THAT THERE IS A 
MAJOR RESPONSE THERE AS YOU CAN 
SEE. 
THE AMBULANCES AS WELL HAVE 
ARRIVED ON SCENE. 
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE AT 
LEAST FOUR FATALITIES AS A 
RESULT OF THIS SHOOTING. 
THAT INFORMATION COMES DIRECTLY 
FROM FREDERICTON POLICE. 
JOHN IN? 
>> GREAT WORK. 
I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE OFF TO THE 
SCENE. 
WE WILL TALK TO YOU SOON ON CBC 
NETWORK. 
>> THANKS, JOHN. 
>> NEARBY 20 KIDS ARE UNDER 
LOCK DOWN. 
RACHEL IS LOOKING AFTER THE 
YOUNG PEOPLE AND DEALING WITH 
PARENTS AND CONCERN ALL AROUND 
HER. 
SHE DID SPEAK TO US. 
HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 
>> INFANTS, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 AND 7-
YEAR-OLD HERE TODAY. 
WE HAVE OUR CENTER ON LOCKDOWN. 
WE HAVE A FEW KIDS HERE. 
WE HAVE ABOUT 23 KIDS IN OUR 
CARE CURRENTLY THAT WERE 
DROPPED OFF BEFORE WE WENT ON 
LOCKDOWN BECAUSE WE WERE 
UNAWARE OF HOW SERIOUS THE 
SITUATION WAS IN THE BEGINNING. 
WE ARE NOT HAVING ANYONE COME 
IN OR ANYONE LEAVE AND WE HAVE 
ALL OF OUR DOORS LOCKED AND ON 
TOP OF THAT WE HAVE SECURITY 
DOORS. 
SO, WE HAVE TWO DOOR PROTECTION 
RIGHT NOW. 
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IS GOOD. 
THEY ARE WATCHING A MOVIE. 
THEY THINK IT'S COOL TO HANG 
OUT WITH THEIR SIBLINGS. 
THEY ARE HAPPY. 
THEY DON'T KNOW -- HANGING OUT 
WITH THEIR SIBLINGS. 
THEY ARE HAPPY OTHERWISE. 
THEY DON'T KNOW. 
WE HAVE ASSURED PARENTS THAT WE 
ARE KEEPING THEM SAFE. 
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. 
FOR THE PARENTS THAT TRIED TO 
DROP OFF WHEN WE WERE IN LOCK 
DOWN, THEY WERE QUITE SCARED 
AND DROVE RIGHT HOME TO GO ON 
LOCKDOWN THEMSELVES. 
THE AREA -- OUR FAMILIES THAT 
GO HERE ALL LIVE IN THE 
BROOKSIDE DRIVE AREA. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS AT 
HOME ON LOCKDOWN WITH CHILDREN. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS 
DEALING WITH THE SITUATION 
CURRENTLY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT 
OF POLICE OFFICERS AS PARENTS 
HERE SO WE HAVE A FEW OF THEIR 
KIDDOS. 
IT'S SCARY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF 
POLICE OFFICERS DOWN. 
OUR HEARTS ARE THERE. 
>> SHE IS AT A CHILD CARE 
FACILITY. 
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS NOW. 
I THINK -- BEAR WITH ME. 
I THINK WE WILL TALK TO MEGHAN 
ROBERTS WHO IS TRYING TO PIECE 
TOGETHER A TIMELINE. 
WHAT HAPPENED? 
>> WE ARE USING EYEWITNESS 
ACCOUNTS AND USING THE 
INFORMATION WE ARE GETTING FROM 
FREDERICTON POLICE AND TWITTER 
WHERE THEY WILL PUT THE MOST 
ACCURATE INFORMATION. 
THEY HAVE ONE SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY. 
THEY SAY THE BROOKSIDE AREA IS 
CONTAINED FOR THE FORESEEABLE 
FUTURE AND THEY ARE SAYING 
PLEASE CONTINUE TO AVOID THE 
AREA AND FOLLOW THEM FOR THE 
MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION. 
ASSOCIATION ONE SUSPECT IS IN 
CUSTODY. 
STILL AN ACTIVE SCENE FROM WHAT 
WE UNDERSTAND. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TWEET THAT 
THEY SENT OUT. 
THEY SENT THIS OUT BEFORE 8:00 
-- I BELIEVE IN THE MORNING 
LOCAL TIME. 
SO, YOU CAN SEE JUST ABOUT 
BEFORE 8:00 A.M. 
LOCAL TIME. 
THEY ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO AVOID 
THE AREA. 
AN INCIDENT THAT RESULTED IN 
FOUR PEOPLE KILLED. 
THAT WAS THE FIRST WE HEARD 
FROM POLICE. 
EVEN EARLIER, AROUND 7:00 A.M. 
OR JUST AFTER 7:00 A.M. 
WE STARTED HEARING FROM 
WITNESSES WHO ARE HEARING SHOTS 
IN AND AROUND THE AREA THAT YOU 
CAN SEE THERE. 
THIS IS AN ACTIVE SCENE. 
WE ARE NOT SAYING WHERE PEOPLE 
ARE LOCATED. 
WHERE THEY HEARD OR SAW WHAT. 
JUST AFTER 7:00 A.M. 
LOCAL TIME PEOPLE HEARD SHOTS, 
FOUR SHOTS UP TO 17 SHOTS FROM 
PEOPLE THAT THEY HEARD BEING 
FIRED. 
A LOT OF LOCAL BUSINESSES IN 
THE AREA THAT ARE SHUT DOWN AS 
PART OF THIS GREATER LOCK DOWN. 
A TWO-HOUR -- TWO TO THREE 
HOURS BETWEEN THE FIRST SHOTS 
FIRED AND ONE IN CUSTODY -- ONE 
SUSPECT IN CUSTODY. 
LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF THE 
WITNESSES ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT 
THEY HEARD THIS MORNING. 
AROUND 7:00 I HEARD WHAT I 
THOUGHT WERE FIRECRACKERS 
INITIALLY. 
A BANG FOLLOWED BY A BANG, 
BANG, BANG, THEN RAPID FIRE 
THEN ANOTHER BANG. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A PECULIARIZE 
QUEENS. 
A FEW MINUTES LATER I STEPPED 
OUTSIDE TO MAKE SURE, TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS HEARING. 
I HEARD IT AGAIN BUT LOUDER. 
IT SOUNDED THE SAME. 
THE SAME FREQUENCY, SAME SORT 
OF SOUND. 
THEN ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES LATER I 
HEARD A LOUD SOUND THAT HAD A 
MUCH DIFFERENT PITCH TO IT. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A RIFLE BUT I 
DON'T KNOW. 
>> AROUND 7:00 A.M. 
LOCAL TIME THEY HEARD SHOTS 
FIRED. 
WITNESSES WERE HEARING SHOTS 
FIRED THROUGHOUT 7:00 TO 8:00 
A.M. 
SO, THERE COULD BE A PERIOD 
THERE, A TIME -- CHUNK OF TIME 
WHEN THERE WERE SHOTS BEING 
FIRED. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE OR WHO WAS 
FIRING THE SHOTS. 
WE KNOW A COUPLE OF HOURS 
LATER, 2 1/2 HOURS, IS THAT 
THERE IS ONE SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY. 
THIS IS AN ACTIVE SCENE. 
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING AGAIN AND 
AGAIN AND AGAIN AS WE GET 
INFORMATION FROM SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY, FROM POLICE ON 
TWITTER THAT YOU CAN GO TO THEM 
FOR INFORMATION BUT DON'T POST 
YOUR OWN INFORMATION ONLINE. 
DON'T POST YOUR LOCATION. 
THIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE SCENE. 
THERE IS POLICE WORK GOING ON. 
THEY DON'T WANT ANY OF THEIR 
ACTIVITIES TO BE REVEALED. 
JOHN? 
>> YES. 
DON'T EMPHASIZE ANYTHING ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT WOULD 
INDICATE WHERE THE POLICE ARE. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE 
WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT. 
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THEIR 
JOBS WITHOUT INDIVIDUALS THEY 
ARE LOOKING FOR KNOWING WHERE 
THEY ARE. 
>>> HELLO, I'M ANNE-MARIE 
GREEN. 
WE ARE LISTENING TO THE CBC 
NETWORK NEWS OUT OF CANADA 
COVERING BREAKING NEWS. 
THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW. 
FOUR PEOPLE ARE DEAD AFTER A 
SHOOTING. 
POLICE SAY THE SUSPECT IS IN 
CUSTODY AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING 
TO FIGURE OUT A POSSIBLE 
MOTIVE. 
IT HAPPENED AROUND 7:30 EASTERN 
THIS MORNING IN THE CITY OF 
FREDERICTON, NEW BRUNSWICK. 
LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILES FROM 
THE U.S. BORDER IN MAINE. 
>> THE AREA THAT WE ARE IN ARE 
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. 
THERE ARE LOTS OF, YOU KNOW, 
HOMES WITH ATTACHED GARAGES, 
APARTMENT BUILDINGS. 
IT LOOKS LIKE A FAMILY ORIENTED 
AREA IN FRED RING TON. 
>> AN AREA AT THAT HOUR -- 
FREDERICTON. 
>> AN AREA THAT AT THAT HOUR, 
YOU HAVE PEOPLE GOING TO WORK, 
ACCEPTING KIDS TO SCHOOL AND 
GOING FOR COFFEE? 
>> THIS IS AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING ABOUT 
THEIR REGULAR DAY AND THAT 
CHANGED SUDDENLY THIS MORNING. 
>> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE -- 
WE CAN'T BE SPECIFIC ABOUT 
POLICE AND WHERE THEY ARE OR 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT THIS 
WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A FULL COURT 
PRESS FOR THE POLICE OF 
FREDERICTON AND IN A POSITION, 
I GUESS, TO BRING IN THE RCMP 
INTO THE INVESTIGATION. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT SORT OF 
ASSETS ARE ON THE GROUND IN 
TERMS OF POLICE PRESENCE? 
>> THERE IS A LARGE POLICE 
PRESENCE. 
WHILE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE 
SPECIFICS OF WHERE THEY ARE AND 
WHAT THEY HAVE, THERE IS A 
LARGE POLICE PRESENCE ON SCENE 
AS WELL AS FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
THERE WAS AN AMBULANCE HERE BUT 
IT LEFT THE SCENE. 
IT'S A LARGE POLICE PRESENCE. 
>> WE WANT TO READ A STATEMENT 
ISSUED BY THE PREMIER OF NEW 
BRUNSWICK. 
WE ARE ALL SHOCKED AND SADDENED 
TO LEARN OF THE ONGOING TRAGIC 
INCIDENT IN FREDERICTON. 
I OFFER MY COOL DONE LENSES 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO THE 
VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES 
DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME.

KEEPING US SAFE. 
I WOULD ASK NEW BRUNSWICKERS TO 
KEEP INFORMED ABOUT THE 
SITUATION AS IT DEVELOPS AND

ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WORKING 
IN THAT AREA. 
AGAIN, POLICE SAY THAT DESPITE 
A PERSON BEING IN CUSTODY THAT

SITUATION.

DEVELOPING STORY AND WE WILL 
BRING YOU UPDATES THROUGHOUT 
THE MORNING AS IT WARRANTS.
