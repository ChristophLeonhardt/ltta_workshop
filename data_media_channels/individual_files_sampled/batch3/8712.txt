MAR VISTA BRING A FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO NATO, NOW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE McCAIN INSTITUTE. AMBASSADOR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YOU. HERE WE ARE COMMENTS OF THE SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN IS BACK ON FOR JUNE 12 IN SINGAPORE. BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT HE MADE TO SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON, IN A SURPRISE MEETING SATURDAY, KIM JONG-UN REMAINS, HE SAYS HE REMAINS COMMITTED TO COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. AND THE END OF THE KOREAN WAR. CAN HE BE TRUSTED? I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY. AND THEN SEE WHETHER WE CAN COME UP WITH A DEAL THAT IS REAL AND VERIFIABLE AND IMPLEMENTED. THE ALTERNATIVE IS NOT TO DO THAT. I THINK IT IS WORTH TRYING AND SEEING WHAT WE CAN DO. THIS IS ENCOURAGING STATEMENTS BUT OF COURSE, NORTH KOREA HAS POINTED OUT IT HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING IN THE PAST ONLY TO BACKTRACK SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. PRESIDENT COME WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE THE MOTIVATION TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE PROPOSED COMMITMENTS? A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST OFF, I THINK THE NORTH KOREAN ECONOMY AND SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY ITSELF IS MUCH WEAKER THAN MANY OBSERVERS IMAGINED. THERE IS A SUSTAINABILITY FACTOR FOR THE COUNTRY INTERNALLY. SECOND, WHAT WAS REFERENCED ABOUT SECURITY GUARANTEES. THE IDENTITY WILL NOT BE AN EXTERNAL EFFORT TO CHANGE THE REGIME. I THINK THOSE RESULTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM. THIRD, I THINK HE RELISHED THE SPOTLIGHT OF BEING THERE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO YOU THAT IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT HE CAN GET IS A REAL COMMITMENT OR NOT. ALSO PERHAPS HIS LEGACY. HE CAN BE THE ONE WHO CHANGES COURSE OF THINGS. WHEN HIS GRANDFATHER AND FATHER DID NOT. THAT IS AN OPTIMISTIC NOTION. I AGREE, PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD BE HISTORIC AND SIGNIFICANT. WHO KNOWS!LET'S STAY FOCUSED ON EXACTLY WHAT IT IS WE ARE TRYING TO AGREE ON AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. THAT IS STILL A LITTLE FUZZY. ALREADY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING LISTEN, THERE COULD BE VARYING DEFINITIONS OF WHAT COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD LOOK LIKE. THAT IS TRUE. BUT I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE US HAS CLEAR GOALS IN HIS MIND. WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS A LONG TIME. NO WE CANNOT LIVE WITH NUCLEAR ARMED NORTH KOREA POINTING ITS WEAPONS AT THE UNITED STATES AND THREATENING ALLIES IN THE REGION AS WELL. WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS. IT IS WORTH TRYING TO SEE WHETHER WE CAN HAVE THE MEETING, WE CAN CREATE A DISCUSSION. THERE ARE WAYS TO PROVIDE AND DO THAT. WE HAVE TO MEET AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS. DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE BELIEVE? I THINK IS BETTER TO LEAVE THAT TO THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. I THINK THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT. I DO NOT WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE. FAIR ENOUGH. LISTEN, IF THE LEADERS OF KOREA ARE COOPERATING. CHINA HELPING THE US WITH PRESSURE ON PYONGYANG AND CIRCUMVENTING A TRADE WAR WITH THE US CADET IS EASING SOME OF THE STRAIN ON THE US CHINA RELATIONS. WHAT ABOUT JAPAN? DON'T THEY HAVE A ROLE IN THE REGION? THEY CERTAINLY DO. THERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE AND NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES. THEY ALSO HAVE A DIFFICULT BUT A RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA. AND THEY CAN BE A REGIONAL PLAYER. NORMALLY CHINA IS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS THE MOST INFLUENCE ON NORTH KOREA. GETTING CHINA TO SUPPORT THE EFFORT AND CHINA NORTH KOREA PUTTING PRESSURE. THAT MEANS JAPAN RIGHT NOW KIND OF STAYS PREPARED TO DEFEND ITSELF AND PREPARED TO JOIN THE POLITICAL PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. THE LEVERAGE ON NORTH KOREA IF YOU WILL, TYPICALLY ECONOMICAL COME FROM CHINA. KURT VOLKER, AS EVERYONE IS WATCHING, THE WORLD IS WATCHING. WHAT IS THE IMPRESSION ON THE WORLD STAGE AS INTERNATIONAL LAW ALLIES AND FOES WATCH ALL OF THIS UNFOLD? A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HOLDING THEIR BREATH. AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AROUND THE WORLD. YET, HE IS MANAGED TO FLIP THIS FROM BEING TWEETS ABOUT "ROCKET MAN" TO BE NATURAL NEGOTIATION ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION AND A POSSIBLE MEETING. PEOPLE ARE QUITE SURPRISED BY THAT. OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE THIS BE SUCCESSFUL. NOW YOU SEE PEOPLE HOLDING THEIR BREATH AND WAITING AND SEEING HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT. IT DOES LOOK LIKE MOST WANT TO SEE THIS SUCCEED IN SOME SHAPE OR FORM. IS THERE ANYONE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE SORT OF HIDING BEHIND THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND NORTH KOREA TO HOPE THAT THEY ULTIMATELY WILL FAIL? I THINK THERE'S A GREAT DISTRACTION. MAYBE IRAN IS HOPING IT WILL BE PROLONGED. APART FROM THAT, HE OF COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, CHINA, EUROPEANS, UNITED STATES, EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE NORTH KOREA FREE OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AND CREATING A LONG-TERM PIECE,
