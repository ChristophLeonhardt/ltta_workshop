1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,120
TED NUGENT IS ACTUALLY ARGUING
THAT HE NEEDS TO STOP

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,870
ENGAGING IN HATEFUL RHETORIC AND
HE BELIEVES THAT WE NEED TO

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,080
HAVE CIVILIZED DISCOURSE IN THIS
COUNTRY.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,350
KEEP IN MIND THAT TED NUGENT IS
THE SAME PERSON WHO HELD UP

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,920
A ASSAULT WEAPONS AND SAID THAT
OBAMA SHOULD SUCK ON IT.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,950
I THINK THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,060
HAVE HIS EXACT QUOTE AND ADJUST
THE SECOND BUT HERE'S WHAT

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,160
HE JUST RECENTLY SAID ABOUT
HIS RHETORIC THAT I HAVE

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,140
REEVALUATED MY APPROACH.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,980
THIS WAS DURING AN INTERVIEW ON
ABC RADIO IN NEW YORK.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,000
HE ALSO SAID, HE WAS A STREET
FIGHTER WHO USED A CERTAIN HARSH

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,429
TERMS THAT YOU WEREN'T A STREET
FARM FIGHTER.

13
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,100
YOU SHAFT ON YOURSELF TO AVOID
THE DRAFT.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,640
YOU ARE NOT A STREET FIGHTER,
YOU ARE CAUGHT BUT

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,280
NONETHELESS, IT IS INTERESTING
THAT HE IS COMING AT THIS FROM A

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,130
SOFTER ANGLE SO I WANT TO MAYBE
POSSIBLY GIVE HIM SOME CREDIT.

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,610
HE SAYS AT THE TENDER AGE OF 69,
MY WIFE HAS CONVINCED ME

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,500
THAT I JUST CAN'T USE THOSE
HARSH TERMS.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,790
I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT THAT I
ENCOURAGE EVEN MY FRIENDS

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,360
OR ENEMIES ON THE LEFT IN THE
DEMOCRAT AND LIBERAL WORLD

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,399
THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE CIVIL TO
EACH OTHER, THAT THE WHOLE

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,790
WORLD IS WATCHING AMERICA, WE
HAVE THE GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,650
LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF
HAPPINESS, AND WE'VE GOT TO

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,420
BE MORE RESPECTFUL TO THE OTHER
SIDE.

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,310
BECAUSE I SAID THAT I WOULD
GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF WHAT HE

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,310
SAID IN THE PAST, LET'S GO TO
GRAPHIC 15.

27
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,909
HE HAS CALLED PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA A SUBHUMAN MONGOL AND

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,380
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE
HILLARY CLINTON A WORTHLESS

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,380
PITCH.

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,660
DURING THE 2007 PERFORMANCE,
NUGENT HELD UP WHAT APPEARED TO

31
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,490
BE TO MACHINE GUNS AND SAID THAT
OBAMA COULD SUCK ON MY MACHINE

32
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,420
GUN AND THAT CLINTON COULD RIDE
ONE OF THESE INTO THE SUNSET.

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,640
HE ALSO DREW THE ATTENTION TO
THE SECRET SERVICE BACK IN

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,140
2012 WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD BE
DEAD OR IN JAIL BY THIS

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,560
TIME NEXT YEAR IF OBAMA GOT
REELECTED.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,439
BUT NOW HE REALIZES OR ALLEGES
TO REALIZE THAT HE SHOULDN'T

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,430
SPEAK THAT WAY IF HE REALLY
WANTS TO SWITCH UP THE RHETORIC.

38
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,290
I THINK IT IS INTERESTING
THAT HIS WIFE CONVINCED HIM

39
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,810
TO CHANGE AND NOT HIS
CONSCIENCE.

40
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,830
AFTER TALKING TO MY WIFE, BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING?

41
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,299
I LOVE TO HEAR PEOPLE, I AM FROM
AN AREA WHERE THERE WAS A

42
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,420
LOT OF VIOLENCE THAT I LOVE TO
HEAR PEOPLE START CHANGING

43
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,949
UP, FLIPPING THE SCRIPT WHEN
PEOPLE START GETTING SHOT

44
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,870
THAT THERE LIKE I WANTED TO DO
IT ANYMORE.

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,620
ONE OF THEIR OWN GETS SHOT.

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,480
WHEN THEY REALIZE HOW MORTAL
AND HOW VULNERABLE AND

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,849
ACCESSIBLE ANYBODY CAN BE AT
ANY MOMENT, THEN YOU START

48
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,220
THINKING LET ME STOP PUSHING
ALL THIS HATE BECAUSE THAT

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,540
COULD BE ME ON THE OTHER END OF
THAT GUNS ARE

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,999
BECAUSE THERE ARE A TON OF
UNHINGED INDIVIDUALS WHO

51
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:37,230
COULD BE ENCOURAGED BY THE TYPE
OF HATEFUL RHETORIC THAT IS

52
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,379
BEING SPEWED.

53
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,349
I AGREE WITH THAT NOTION.

54
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,450
I THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE CIVIL
WITH ONE ANOTHER ESPECIALLY

55
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,999
THOSE THAT WE DISAGREE WITH.

56
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,739
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN CRAZY,
ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS PAST

57
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:50,840
ELECTION.

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,099
YOU SEE A CHANGE OF RHETORIC
AMONG THOSE WHO WERE ALWAYS

59
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,419
HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD.

60
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,329
I BELIEVE IT WAS DARRELL ISA
BUT RECENTLY A REPORTER

61
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,439
APPROACHED AN ELECTED OFFICIAL
UNJUSTLY ASKED THE QUESTION

62
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,159
IN HIS RESPONSE WAS TO GIVE HER
THE MIDDLE FINGER.

63
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,439
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

64
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,689
BUT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO
HANDLE A QUESTION FROM A

65
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:15,689
REPORTER.

66
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,769
IT'S ALSO NOT APPROPRIATE TO
ASSAULT REPORTED BUT THAT

67
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,420
WOULD BE ELECTED.

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,650
WERE NOT GOING TO GET TO THIS
POINT OF BAFFLE CIVIL DISCOURSE

69
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,120
WHEN ONE SIDE, NOT EVERYBODY ON
THE SIDE AND I HAVE GROWN THE

70
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,409
RESPECT I HAVE DEVELOPED FOR THE
FEW REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN

71
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,809
ADAMANT AND CONSISTENT IN THEIR
CRITICISM OF ALL THAT KIND OF

72
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:43,469
BEHAVIOR, OF CONGRESSMAN BODY
SLAMMING A REPORTER,

73
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,799
FLIPPING A REPORTER OFTEN ARE
CONSISTENTLY CRITICAL OF

74
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,319
EVERYTHING IN THE TRUMPET
MINISTRATION DOES BECAUSE THEY

75
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,010
KNOW THAT IT IS NOT CONSERVATIVE
AND IT IS MOSTLY NOT AMERICAN.

76
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,530
THERE'S A PRETTY BIG LIST.

77
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,019
I FOLLOW MANY OF THEM ON
TWITTER.

78
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,500
WHERE I HAVE TO CHANGE IS WHEN
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS OVER, I

79
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,069
HOPE MAYBE I WILL LISTEN TO
THOSE GUYS BECAUSE I WILL THINK

80
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,639
OKAY, WE DISAGREE BUT YOU GUYS
ARE NOT INSANE AND YOU

81
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,159
STOOD UP WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY
DIFFICULT TO STAND UP

82
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,909
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IS STANDING
UP.

83
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,720
THAT SAID, WE HAVE MILLIONS,
TENS OF MILLIONS OF

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,130
AMERICANS WHO DON'T OPERATE FROM
THE SAME FACT SHEET THAT WE

85
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,680
DO AND IT IS NOT TO
INTERPRETATION.

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,410
IT IS A FACT SHEET.

87
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,540
IT IS A SHEET OF FACTS AND I
THINK IT IS NOT THERE AND I

88
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,069
THINK IT IS THERE AND IN SO WE
CAN SORT OF GET TO A POINT WERE

89
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:41,100
WE CAN BASICALLY AGREE,
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND AN

90
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,270
ARGUMENT COULD BE I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD DESTROY JOBS, IT

91
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,810
IS GOING TO GO TO SLOW AND I
THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A VERY

92
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,599
CAUTIOUS, SLOW APPROACH TO IT.

93
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,770
OKAY, BUT AT LEAST WE ARE
GETTING ARGUING OF THE SAME

94
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,770
SET OF SHEETS.

95
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,919
AT LEAST THE CONVERSATION
STARTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

96
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,979
THAT THE FACTS ARE

97
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,370
AND THEN WE DEBATE HOW TO FIX
IT YOU WOULD WANT TO FIX IT

98
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,400
IN A LESS AGGRESSIVE WAY THAN
I AND OTHERS ON THE LEFT

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,530
WOULD WANT TO FIX IT, BUT OKAY.

100
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,319
THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS, NOT
THAT IT IS MADE UP IN CHINA

101
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,840
DID IT TO DESTROY OUR ECONOMY.

102
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
RATE?

103
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,840
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF
COURSE OF THOUSANDS BUT

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,750
EVERY DAY, TRUMP TELLS THESE
CRAZY LIES.

105
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,120
THIS WEEKEND AND I KIND OF
RECOMMEND IT, IT WON'T LAST

106
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,139
FOREVER BUT I FOUND, THE
FOLLOWING THINGS ON TWITTER, TWO

107
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,509
LOOPY CONSERVATIVES TO FOLLOW
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WANT TO KNOW

108
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,759
EVERY DAY, THESE ARE NON-FAMOUS
PEOPLE AND I AM NOT EVEN SURE

109
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,860
THEYíRE REAL PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY
HAVE A LOT OF FOLLOWERS AND THEY

110
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,990
HAVE NO SHOW, SO I AM CURIOUS.

111
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,009
THEY ALSO REALLY GOOD-LOOKING.

112
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,409
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD, BUT I WAS
LIKE WHAT IS THIS?

113
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,631
EVERYDAY, BECAUSE
I'M GOING TO DO MY

114
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,939
TWITTER FEED IíM LIKE WHAT IS THE
STUFF?

115
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,290
OH, I FOLLOWED HER YESTERDAY.

116
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,930
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A
WOMAN, BY THE WAY.

117
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,990
NO QUESTION THAT PROMPTED IT.

118
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,069
IíM LIKE, WHY IS THIS PERSON AND I
LOOKED AND I LOOKED MORE

119
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,830
AND I'M TOTALLY CURIOUS.

120
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,840
THEY DON'T FOLLOW ME.

121
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,800
IT'S CRAZY, THE THINGS THAT THEY
SAY.

122
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,340
THE CRAZY INTERPRETATION OF
THE NEWS AND SO MANY FAKE

123
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,720
STORIES FROM WEBSITES THAT I
HAVE NEVER HEARD OF.

124
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,160
STORIES THAT YOU CAN TELL BY THE
HEADLINE AREN'T TRUE, BUT I'M

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,300
CURIOUS WHAT THEY ARE READING
AND WHAT THEY ARE BELIEVING AND

126
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,160
FIRST OF ALL REAL QUICK, THIS
WHOLE WORLD OF VIDEOS AND

127
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,060
STORIES ABOUT HOW JEFF
SESSIONS CRUSHED IT IN THE

128
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,050
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT
CRUSHED IT AND PUT AN END

129
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,060
TO ANY NOTION OF COLLUSION
BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA.

130
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,680
BUT YOU ARE LIKE WHAT?

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,790
THAT'S AT LEAST INTERPRETATION.

132
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,749
THAT IS AT LEAST NOT, I GUESS
YOU COULD THINK THAT BUT IT

133
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:52,379
IS SUPER INTERESTING TO FOLLOW.

134
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,430
THERE IS SOMETHING TO WHAT TED
NUGENT SAYS.

135
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,960
I'LL TAKE WHATEVER NUMBER YOU
SAID BEFORE HE SAYS

136
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,099
SOMETHING HATEFUL OR AWFUL, I
WILL TAKE THE UNDERDOG

137
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,889
I THINK ALSO THAT THIS CALL
FOR DIPLOMACY BECAUSE NOW

138
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,229
PEOPLE STARTED TO GET HURT IS
REALLY INTERESTING, BUT YOU

139
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,360
CAN ONLY PUSH THE PEOPLE SO FAR.

140
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,840
PEOPLE HAVE REACHED, YOU THINK
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE

141
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,819
ECONOMY AND PEOPLE'S JOBS IN
HEALTHCARE.

142
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,009
THE PEOPLE CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH
AND YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP

143
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,219
PUSHING THEM AND PUSHING THEM.

144
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,960
YOU WANT US TO BE DIPLOMATIC?

145
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,440
OUR ELDERS ARE NOT BEING CARED
FOR, THE THINGS THAT ARE

146
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,520
HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY THAT
ARE UNBELIEVABLE AND YOUR

147
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,039
PRESIDENT IS ON TWITTER.

148
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,960
THIS YOUNG GIRL JUST GIVEN TO
THE OTHER DAY AND WAS LIKE DO

149
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,280
YOU KNOW HOW MANY SHARES ON IN
TWITTER TROMBONES THAT

150
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,569
DON'T THINK IT'S INTERESTING
THAT EVERYTHING, HE GOES TO

151
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,569
TWITTER 4.

152
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,400
DON'T YOU THINK HE OWNS THE ICE
WHEN I TALK TO THE YOUNG

153
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,059
TURKS, I'M GOING TO TELL THEM TO
GET ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK

154
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,159
IT IS REALLY INTERESTING THAT HE
ALWAYS TAKES THINGS TO TWITTER.

155
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,789
YOU HAVE PRESIDENTS AND
POLITICIANS DOING TWITTER

156
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:04,979
BEEF LIKE WRAPPERS IN THE 90S.

157
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,249
IT'S GOTTEN TO A POINT, WE LIKE
LORD OF THE FLIES.

158
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,300
AND EVEN THAT I FEEL LIKE IS
UP TO, UP FOR INTERPRETATION

159
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,790
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK OH, HE
IS MORE ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE

160
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,800
HE IS ON TWITTER SO THERE'S MORE
TRANSPARENCY, BUT NO.

161
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,550
HE USES TWITTER IN MY OPINION AS
A WAY OF ESCAPING ANY REAL,

162
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,289
ELABORATING ON HIS POLICIES.

163
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,809
ACTUALLY TALKING TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE IN A DETAILED WAY.

164
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,479
AND 40 CHARACTERS OF NONSENSE,
ANYONE CAN DO THAT.

165
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,830
I FEEL LIKE THAT IS HIS WAY
OF ESCAPING ANY REAL

166
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,479
RESPONSIBILITY THAT HE HAS AS
PRESIDENT ARE

167
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,269
IT'S A WASTE TO HIS BASE
UNFILTERED IMMEDIATELY.

168
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,720
IS EFFECTIVE.

169
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
AND THEY BELIEVE HIM.

170
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,940
AS EVIDENCED BY THIS NEW
LITTLE TRICK I'VE GOT WHICH I'M

171
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,240
SURE OTHER PEOPLE CAME UP WITH
FIRST BUT IT IS TOUGH TO READ.

172
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,860
AS LONG AS WE HAVE 99%

173
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,010
OF THE PEOPLE EARNING NONE OF
THE MONEY.

174
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,589
I AM USING THAT AS A SYMBOL OF
THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY BUT

175
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,310
AS LONG AS THAT CONTINUES TO
HAPPEN, AS LONG AS WE

176
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,050
CONTINUE TO BE A COUNTRY WHERE
THE HAVE AND HAVE-NOTS

177
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,130
DIVISION IS GLARING.

178
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,230
WE'VE HAD IT BEFORE, WE'VE
ALWAYS HAD IT.

179
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,080
WE WILL ACCEPT SOME OF IT.

180
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,980
WE GET IT, THIS IS AMERICA.

181
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,220
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO A
LOT BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE.

182
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,130
I DON'T THINK REASONABLE
AMERICANS, NOBODY WANTS TO

183
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,500
STOP RICH PEOPLE FROM BEING
RICH.

184
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,850
BUT WE'VE CROSSED SOME DANGEROUS
POINTS AND THAT FRUSTRATION THAT

185
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,579
WE SAW IN WASHINGTON AND THAT'S
OBVIOUSLY A CRAZY PERSON JUST

186
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:47,021
LIKE IT WAS WITH GABBY GIFFORDS,
BUT THAT ANGER IS REAL THAT WE

187
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:51,980
SAW IN NOVEMBER AND THE IDEA
THAT WE CAN HUG IT OUT IS A

188
00:09:51,980 --> 00:00:00,000
GIGANTIC MISTAKE.
