when when he was speaking and that was like an easy layup with how hard can it be to criticize neo-nazis right sort of put you in the place where we are where it's it's just surreal that Donald Trump has trouble even criticizing neo-nazis and white supremacists but you know what we have a guy who wants to be in the United States Supreme Court and we'll get to this later to Brett Kavanaugh who would not even answer whether it was right to stop people from coming from from coming into the United States because of the race that's I mean that's unheard of but again we'll get to that a little bit later on but these are strange strange times and unfortunately weak and sniffling men and women will do or say just about anything I just looked at Capitol Hill to see that to try to get in the good graces of a man who has absolutely no understanding about what America's constitutional norms are or who we are what values we have as a country yeah my my daughter has stopped talking to me about politics quite some time ago because it was all too much and too negative my phone lit up both of them during Obama's speech and snapchats and you know what it all started coming in because they were finally excited again so that that certainly said something former President Obama continued his foray back into the political scene this weekend once again making the case against the man now holding his old job President Trump the former president was on the campaign trail in California on Saturday working to rally voters as Democrats make plays for seven competitive congressional districts there Obama's speech was notably different from the one he delivered in Illinois on Friday working to turn out the vote in November rather than directly attacking the Trump administration still the former President took a number of veiled shots at successor we're in a challenging moment because when you look at the arc of American history there has always been a push and pull between those who want to go forward and those who want to look back between those who want to divide and those who who are seeking to bring people together between those who promote a politics of hope and and those who exploit politics of fear I deeply believe is that there are no set of problems there's no set of issues that we can't solve if we're working together and we're true to the traditions that are best in America it's always tempting for politicians for their own gain and for people in power to to try to see if they can divide people scapegoat folks turn them on each other because when that happens you get gridlock and government doesn't work and people get cynical and they decide not to participate micki you talked about before how this is unusual for a former president to actually be campaigning against a current president the current president centrist well you of course have Donald Trump who's broken every rule you have Donald Trump who was still campaigning against a woman he defeated two years ago still having crowds chant lock her up lock her up Donald Trump is can making this a continuation of of a campaign against Hillary Clinton and a constant campaign against Barack Obama so if if I were a Democrat and if I were somebody that that wanted to win this fall I would hope that Barack Obama would go all-in go there and and do what he needs to do to draw the line not between him but draw the line between America's political and constitutional norms yes it's just how demented and twisted some of the state's statements and policies this president has promoted over the past year and a half have actually been somebody's got to do it yeah because the Democratic Party does not have a voice of opposition Barack Obama is that voice it was really if you could argue he was campaigning for decency and belief in the system quite frankly one of Obama's comments from his speech in Illinois on Friday appears to have gotten under president Trump's skin during that speech mr. Obama reminded the crowd that the economic success mr. Trump likes to claim credit for actually begin under his watch by the time I left office household income was near its all-time high and the uninsured rate had hit an all-time low and wages were rising and poverty rates were falling I mentioned all this just so when you hear how great the economy is doing right now let's just remember when this recovery started all right following that comment president Trump fired off a number of tweets on the economy over the weekend including one setting comments from former House Oversight Chairman jason Chaffetz quoting Barack Obama talked a lot about hope but Donald Trump delivered the American dream all the economic indicators what's happening overseas Donald Trump has proven to be far more successful than Barack Obama President Trump is delivering the American dream wow that's delivering a lot of you know what but looking at just one of the most closely watched economic indicators job creation it appears President Obama does have the advantage of a president Trump so far this year an average of 200 and 6,000 jobs have been added per month under Trump an uptick from last year's average of 182 but during President Obama's second term he added an average of 195 226 and 250,000 jobs per month in his final three years just adding some facts into the conversation you know mark McKinnon that's the thing Barack Obama never could go out and brag about how well the economy was doing under him he was he'd seemed tortured to go out and tell people actually the good news about his administration he may start doing that now but there are a lot of Americans and it's frustrating there are even a lot of people in news that listen to Donald Trump and see the showmanship and go well yeah the economy has gotten a lot better under him now if you just look at hard fast economic numbers the rate of growth the the rate of you know whether you look at the S&P or whatever it's it's about the same under Donald Trump as it was under Barack Obama who actually inherited the worst economy since 1932 well Joe I think it's interesting that first of all we should compare apples to apples and let's wait till we have four years or eight years to compare against each other but you know we are throwing out all the rules of the campaign and it's interesting to watch Barack Obama step up and you can tell he's relishing it and what's interesting to see is the whole fall I think is going to be like this we're going to have a split screen with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and you know one is really good at campaigning about hope the other is really good about it campaigning against fear or with fear so we're gonna have a hope fear element in this campaign and two of the best at doing hope and doing fear so it'll be interesting to see well you know Nick confess or II though also this isn't a nationwide contest as you as you know and as our viewers know we're going district-by-district you know Barack Obama is gonna pick those California districts and Illinois districts he's gonna pick other districts across America where Republicans are holding the seats but they were won by Hillary Clinton and sort of have a blue tent to them it seems to me that Barack Obama is over we popular in all of those districts look Joe his job is not to come out and be the standard-bearer for the entire party he is a targeted shot in the arm in key districts places where Democrats can flip a seat or get higher turnout and and at a Secura seat but it's still fascinating to watch him in action it's like having been in a Hall of Mirrors with President Trump for the last two years and someone kind of opens the door at the end of the hallway you see daylight it's a return of kind of a reality-based politics and certainly a different tone that you hear from him he is the polar opposite of President Trump in every way but the question for me is this country rejected the politics of President Obama to some extent in in in in a 2016 and turned its back on what he was offering and and and the huge question for me in 2018 is if that still continues or if there is some party electorate that wants to turn their back on President Trump now hey you know Eddie though what's so fascinating watching Barack Obama go at there I see a politician who who disagreed with on many policies from the way he did a stimulus package to how he didn't move I thought its decisive least he needed to in Syria and I could go down a long list of areas where I disagreed with him idea ideologically but I know a lot of Republicans a lot of conservatives who saw him up there and said man it's nice to have a like a normal guy out there again even if I disagree with him at least we agree on the Constitution and we agree on you know how we treat our neighbors and we agree on just the basics of American life and the basics in civil discourse on the campaign trail absolutely Joe and you know as you know I disagreed with President Obama from from ideologically from the left but it was nice to see and hear reasoned thinking a kind of thoughtfulness and and in some ways a commitment to the basic norms of democratic life that is that have in some ways define the country at least since I've been warned and politically aware I think what's interesting though is that when we think about President Obama stepping out I think making is absolutely right he's a very it's a very deliberate deployment but he opens up space Donald Trump has taken up so much of the oxygen in the political room that when when when Barack Obama stepped on the scene suddenly we had space to think about matters differently and I think that was a good in and of itself thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you
