They are called primitive dogs
because they haven't been
changed or touched by man.
This is how they were 3,500 years ago
and you can see them in the
Peruvian pottery.
These dogs, not long ago,
have been declared
national patrimony.
They are as important as Machu Picchu.
I always say that these dogs are
really a living treasure.
And, they have passed all the
difficulties and lived until today
loving the human being.
