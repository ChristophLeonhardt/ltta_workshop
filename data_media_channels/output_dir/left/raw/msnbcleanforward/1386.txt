00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,985
KINGDOM. IT’S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET A

50
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,287
IT’S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET A WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL IN FOR 30

51
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,723
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL IN FOR 30 HOURS OF TESTIMONY.

52
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,890
HOURS OF TESTIMONY. WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD

53
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,025
WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD BRUCE LINDSAY, PRESIDENT

54
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,661
BRUCE LINDSAY, PRESIDENT CLINTON’S DEPUTY COUNSEL, IN FOR

00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:34,795
CLINTON’S DEPUTY COUNSEL, IN FOR 30 HOURS OF TESTIMONY.

56
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,197
30 HOURS OF TESTIMONY. INSTEAD WE HAD TO FIGHT AND GO

57
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,366
INSTEAD WE HAD TO FIGHT AND GO TO COURT AND SPEND SOME TIME IN

58
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,101
TO COURT AND SPEND SOME TIME IN ORDER TO FORCE HIM TO TESTIFY.

59
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,703
ORDER TO FORCE HIM TO TESTIFY. SO I THINK IT’S A REAL -- IT

60
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:44,538
SO I THINK IT’S A REAL -- IT WOULD BE A REAL BONANZA FOR A

61
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:45,106
WOULD BE A REAL BONANZA FOR A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

62
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,475
SPECIAL COUNSEL. BUT IT ALSO SHOWS, I THINK GIVE

63
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,676
BUT IT ALSO SHOWS, I THINK GIVE THE PRESIDENT SOME CREDIT, THAT

64
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,779
THE PRESIDENT SOME CREDIT, THAT HE ALLOWED HIM TO GO IN AND DO

65
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,883
HE ALLOWED HIM TO GO IN AND DO THAT INSTEAD OF BEING

66
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:56,283
THAT INSTEAD OF BEING INSTRUCTIVE.

67
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,418
INSTRUCTIVE. SO CONDEMN THE PRESIDENT WHERE

68
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,919
SO CONDEMN THE PRESIDENT WHERE HE DESERVES TO BE CONDEMNED,

69
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,721
HE DESERVES TO BE CONDEMNED, WHICH IS OFTEN, BUT I WOULD

70
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,022
WHICH IS OFTEN, BUT I WOULD APPLAUD THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,258
APPLAUD THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ORIGINAL LAWYERS, JOHN DOWD AND

ORIGINAL LAWYERS, JOHN DOWD AND TY COBB, FOR DOING THIS.

73
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,128
TY COBB, FOR DOING THIS. >> SO McGAHN AND HIS LAWYER

>> SO McGAHN AND HIS LAWYER DECIDED TO BE REALLY, ACCORDING

75

DECIDED TO BE REALLY, ACCORDING TO "THE TIMES" TO BE REALLY OPEN

76
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,132
TO "THE TIMES" TO BE REALLY OPEN WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL BECAUSE

77
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,234
WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT DONALD

78

THEY WERE WORRIED THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS TEAM WERE GOING TO

79
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:16,637
TRUMP AND HIS TEAM WERE GOING TO THROW McGAHN UNDER THE BUS.

80
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:19,507
THROW McGAHN UNDER THE BUS. THIS ALL STARTED OR GOT PROMPTED

81
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,543
THIS ALL STARTED OR GOT PROMPTED BY KEN VOGEL, A "NEW YORK TIMES"

89
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:34,856
TO COOPERATE AS EXTENSIVELY AS WE DO.

90
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,357
WE DO. HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT EXECUTIVE

91
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,292
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, AND THEN SAYING THAT

McGAHN HAS PAPERS HIDDEN AWAY IN A SAFE.

00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:42,631
A SAFE. SO "THE TIMES" REPORTS THAT

SO "THE TIMES" REPORTS THAT McGAHN AND HIS ATTORNEYS TOOK

96

McGAHN AND HIS ATTORNEYS TOOK THAT TO MEAN HE WAS SERIOUSLY

00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,470
LEGALLY LIABLE HERE, THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD PUT HIM IN SOME

00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,205
PRESIDENT COULD PUT HIM IN SOME REAL LEGAL JEOPARDY, SO HE WENT

100
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,874
REAL LEGAL JEOPARDY, SO HE WENT IN AND TOLD THEM ABSOLUTELY

101
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:53,374
IN AND TOLD THEM ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

102
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,042
EVERYTHING. DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT FULLY

103
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:57,278
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT FULLY UNDERSTOOD OR HIS LEGAL TEAM

104
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,581
UNDERSTOOD OR HIS LEGAL TEAM FULLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT McGAHN WAS

105
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,282
FULLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT McGAHN WAS GOING IN TO DO HERE, THAT IT WAS

106
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:02,850
GOING IN TO DO HERE, THAT IT WAS REALLY THEM SAYING, OH, WE HAVE

107
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,252
REALLY THEM SAYING, OH, WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE?

108
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,488
NOTHING TO HIDE? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE DON’T

109
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,957
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE DON’T REALLY KNOW IF THE CONVERSATION

110
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,692
REALLY KNOW IF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN COBB AND DOWD THAT WAS

111
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,694
BETWEEN COBB AND DOWD THAT WAS REPORTED IN "THE TIMES" REALLY

112
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,796
REPORTED IN "THE TIMES" REALLY WAS THE MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR

113
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:15,297
WAS THE MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR McGAHN.

114
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:16,732
McGAHN. IT’S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT

115
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,667
IT’S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE GONE IN AGAINST

116
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,503
HE WOULD HAVE GONE IN AGAINST THE OPPOSITION OF COBB AND DOWD.

117
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:24,506
THE OPPOSITION OF COBB AND DOWD. HERE’S WHAT I THINK REALLY WENT

118
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:24,773
HERE’S WHAT I THINK REALLY WENT ON.

119
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:28,009
ON. TY COBB AND JOHN DOWD THOUGHT

120
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,277
TY COBB AND JOHN DOWD THOUGHT THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS

121
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:32,214
THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS PRIMARILY ABOUT

122
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:32,948
PRIMARILY ABOUT COLLUSION/CONSPIRACY HAVING TO

123
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,584
COLLUSION/CONSPIRACY HAVING TO DO WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THE

124
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:35,917
DO WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THE ELECTION.

125
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,218
ELECTION. THEY FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS

126
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,520
THEY FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ON VERY SOLID GROUND THERE.

127
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,821
ON VERY SOLID GROUND THERE. THEY HAVE SAID THAT FROM THE

128
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,188
THEY HAVE SAID THAT FROM THE BEGINNING.

129
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:43,525
BEGINNING. I DON’T THINK THEY REALIZED WHAT

130
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:46,862
I DON’T THINK THEY REALIZED WHAT A BROAD CONCEPT OF OBSTRUCTION

131
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:47,996
A BROAD CONCEPT OF OBSTRUCTION BOB MUELLER HAS.

132
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:49,631
BOB MUELLER HAS. AND IT IS A VERY BROAD,

133
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,233
AND IT IS A VERY BROAD, UNUSUALLY BROAD VIEW OF

134
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,234
UNUSUALLY BROAD VIEW OF OBSTRUCTION FROM EVERYTHING THAT

135
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:53,101
OBSTRUCTION FROM EVERYTHING THAT WE’VE SEEN.

136
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,736
WE’VE SEEN. AND I THINK NOW THEY MAY LOOK AT

137
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,637
AND I THINK NOW THEY MAY LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY.

138
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:57,506
IT DIFFERENTLY. BUT EVEN AS WE SPEAK NOW, WE

139
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:58,941
BUT EVEN AS WE SPEAK NOW, WE DON’T KNOW WHAT McGAHN SAID OR

140
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,642
DON’T KNOW WHAT McGAHN SAID OR THAT McGAHN HAS DAMAGED THE

141
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,009
THAT McGAHN HAS DAMAGED THE PRESIDENT.

142
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:02,044
PRESIDENT. LIKE SO MUCH IN THIS

143
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:02,912
LIKE SO MUCH IN THIS INVESTIGATION, WE’LL HAVE TO

144
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:05,647
INVESTIGATION, WE’LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT PLAYS OUT.

145
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:06,348
WAIT UNTIL IT PLAYS OUT. >> WE DON’T KNOW OUT, AND YOU’RE

146
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:08,250
>> WE DON’T KNOW OUT, AND YOU’RE VERY GOOD TO POINT THAT OUT.

147
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,618
VERY GOOD TO POINT THAT OUT. BUT McGAHN HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR

148
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:10,953
BUT McGAHN HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR A NUMBER OF KEY MOMENTS THAT WE

149
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,388
A NUMBER OF KEY MOMENTS THAT WE DO KNOW THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS

150
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,021
DO KNOW THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS LOOKING INTO.

151
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:16,625
LOOKING INTO. THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY BEING

152
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,961
THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY BEING ONE, GETTING JEFF SESSIONS TO

UNRECUSE HIMSELF, THE PRESIDENT TELLING McGAHN TO FIRE ROBERT

155
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:24,566
TELLING McGAHN TO FIRE ROBERT MUELLER.

156
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,300
MUELLER. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" FINDING OUT

157
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:26,835
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" FINDING OUT ABOUT IT, WRITING A STORY ABOUT
