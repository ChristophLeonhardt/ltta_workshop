Phil I want to read you this one minute after 11 o'clock Eastern Time tonight since we've been on the air the president has written this the already discredited Woodward books so many lies and phony sources has me calling Jeff Sessions a term we've asked our children not to use and a dumb southerner I said neither never used those terms on anyone including Jeff and being a southerner is a great thing he made this up to divide imagine the timing fill of these book details coming out today in the midst of this Supreme Court hearing yeah well it's it's a huge story these book details and I think it's going to continue to be a story for days if not weeks to come the president should be careful what he's wishing for here and taunting Woodward because Woodward has done meticulous reporting and as Jim Comey once said lordy there are tapes there are a lot of tapes Woodward recorded hundreds of hours of his interviews he has said in a statement tonight that he stands by his reporting and you know I think the president in saying that he has never used that phrase before he better be sure he's right hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
