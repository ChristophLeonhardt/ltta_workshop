00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,495
YOU KNOW, TED CRUZ GOT

196
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,064
HOLLERED AT AT AN AIRPORT

197
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:51,431
YESTERDAY.

198
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,999
WE DID A STORY THIS MORNING

199
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,934
ABOUT HOW TWO CANDIDATES IN

200
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:55,602
MINNESOTA, REPUBLICAN

201
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,403
CANDIDATES WERE ASSAULTED.

202
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,838
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT'S

203
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,340
GOING ON AND HAS ANYBODY

204
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,008
GOTTEN UP IN YOUR FACE?

205
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,511
>> YES.

206
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,447
LACK OF CIVILITY THAT ALWAYS

207
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:07,847
BOTHERS ME.

208
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,115
LOOK AT ERIC HOLDER A COUPLE

209
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,249
DAYS AGO.

210
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,384
WHEN THEY ARE DOWN WE KICK

211
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:11,985
THEM IN THE HEAD.

212
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,453
WHO SAYS THIS AND DOES THAT?

213
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,954
THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES TO

214
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,589
SAY TRUMP, HE PROMOTES EVIL

215
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,957
AND HE IS RACIST AND SEXIST.

216
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,193
YOU HEAR THESE PEOPLE.

217
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,260
YOU SAW WHAT HILLARY SAID

218
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,061
THE OTHER DAY.

219
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,531
IT'S TRULY, TRULY HORRIBLE.

220
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,299
STEVE: ARE THEY COMING AT

221
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,733
YOU.

222
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,100
>> YEAH.

223
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,835
THEY COME AFTER US.

224
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,137
STEVE: HOW, ON THE STREET?

225
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:31,838
AINSLEY: SECRET SERVICE BODY

226
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,472
SLAMS THOUGH, RIGHT?

227
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,474
>> WE WILL BE JUST FINE.

228
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,309
THAT LACK OF CIVILITY IS

229
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,976
REALLY INCREDIBLE.

230
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,277
THEY ARE THE FIRST PERSON TO

231
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,213
POINTS THE FINGER, HEY, THEY

232
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,048
PROMOTE HATE AND VIOLENCE.

233
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:42,915
HONESTLY YOU SAW THAT STORY

234
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,283
AND WHAT THEY DID TO THAT

235
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,085
NICE GIRL OUT IN NEVADA.

236
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:46,819
IT'S HORRIBLE.

237
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,856
I MEAN YOU, IT'S ABSOLUTELY

238
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:50,289
HORRIBLE.

239
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,691
BRIAN: ERIC, EVERY TIME

240
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,392
INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT THE

241
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,526
PRESIDENT IS TOO NICE TO

242
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,193
VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT'S

243
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,695
BECAUSE HE HAS TOO MANY

244
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:56,462
INVESTMENTS IN RUSSIA.

245
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,630
HE IS TOO OPEN TO LETTING

246
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,464
THIS INVESTIGATION PLAY OUT

247
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,099
THAT'S BECAUSE HE HAS

248
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,167
INVESTMENTS IN SAUDI ARABIA.

249
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,935
YOU ARE RUNNING THE TRUMP

250
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,369
ORGANIZATION.

251
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,203
WHAT'S THE RELATES.

252
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,538
>> ZERO INVESTMENTNESS

253
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,572
RUSSIA AND SEVERE

254
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,074
INVESTMENTS IN SAUDIS.

255
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,409
WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

256
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,777
THOSE COUNTRIES.

257
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:11,811
MY FATHER HAS BEEN TOUGHER

258
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,247
ON RUSSIA THAN ANY OTHER

259
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,848
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

260
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,016
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

261
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,318
GIVE OFFENSIVE WEAPONS TO

262
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,652
UKRAINE.

263
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,586
OBAMA NEVER DID THAT YOU

264
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,355
TAKE AWAY THEIR LARGEST

265
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,456
FINANCIAL STREAM, WHEN IS

266
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:23,856
OIL.

267
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,792
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT BUILT,

268
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,294
OIL AND GAS IS WHAT BUILT

269
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:28,628
RUSSIA.

270
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,328
ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE

271
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,564
SAYING WHY DON'T YOU BUY

272
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,032
AMERICAN OIL A LOT OF GREAT

273
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,033
WORKERS AND ENERGY IN THE

274
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:34,300
U.S.

275
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,168
WE WILL SUPPLY YOU ALL THE

276
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,269
ENERGY YOU COULD EVER

277
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,969
POSSIBLY NEED.

278
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,604
DON'T BUY IT FROM RUSSIA.

279
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,539
AINSLEY: TALK TO YOUR DAD

280
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,339
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SAUDI

281
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,007
ARABIA WITH THE JOURNALIST

282
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:41,541
IN TURKEY?

283
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,509
>> IT'S A HORRIBLE

284
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,943
SITUATION.

285
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:44,844
AINSLEY: WHAT ARE HIS

286
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,178
OPTIONS?

287
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:45,878
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO.

288
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,313
>> HORRIBLE SITUATION.

289
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,347
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO

290
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,449
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

291
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,583
I DON'T THINK IT LOOKS GOOD

292
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,150
FOR THEM.

293
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,452
YOU KNOW, BUT I THINK THEY

294
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,386
ARE STILL TRYING TO GET TO

295
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,187
THE BOTTOM OF IT.

296
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:54,754
IT'S SAD.

297
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,290
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND, FOREIGN

298
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,291
COUNTRIES CAN'T GO AROUND

299
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,292
KILLING JOURNALISTS.

300
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,193
HORRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED THERE

301
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,028
EVEN MORE HORRIBLE THE

302
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,762
CIRCUMSTANCES.

303
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,496
AINSLEY: WHAT IS JARED

304
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,831
SAYING I KNOW HE IS CLOSE TO

305
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:05,231
THE PRINCE.

306
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,799
>> I HAVEN'T SPOKEN WITH HIM

307
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,467
WITH IT.

308
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,036
IT'S A SAD SITUATION.

309
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,438
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING EVERYONE

310
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,073
HAS TO CONDEMN.

311
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,641
MY FATHER HAS.

312
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,076
BRIAN: WORD IS THEY WILL

313
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,478
START INVESTIGATING THE

314
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,445
TRUMP ORGANIZATION LET ALONE

315
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,346
THE PRESIDENT AND EVERYONE

316
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:20,847
AROUND HIM.

317
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:21,514
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM.

318
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,850
>> YOU WATCHED THE LEVEL OF

319
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:24,250
HARASSMENT.

320
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:24,817
HE THIS WILL BE

321
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,285
INVESTIGATING YOU, THEY WILL

322
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:26,886
INVESTIGATE EVERYBODY.

323
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,154
THAT'S WHAT THESE PEOPLE DO.

324
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:31,224
I MEAN, THEY WEAPONIZE THE

325
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:31,791
LEGAL SYSTEM.

326
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,159
THEY WILL COME AFTER

327
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,327
EVERYBODY RELENGTHLESSLY.

328
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,394
THEY KNOW THERE IS NOTHING

329
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:35,728
THERE.

330
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,529
BUT IT'S HARASS.

331
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,230
IT'S DISTRACT.

332
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,798
THEY WILL PLANT EVERY STORY.

333
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,333
I MEAN, WE HAVE SEEN.

334
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:40,967
THIS I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

335
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,301
LONG WE HAVE SEEN THIS FOR.

336
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,103
WE WILL GET A LETTER FROM

337
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:44,971
SOME SENATOR.

338
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,105
THAT LETTER IS AT "THE

339
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:46,906
WASHINGTON POST" THREE DAYS

340
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,175
BEFORE WE EVEN RECEIVE IT.

341
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,043
IT IS THE NSAEST SYSTEM.

342
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,078
COMING FROM NEW YORK AND

343
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,913
BEING A TOTAL CIVILIAN IN

344
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,148
THIS PROCESS I HAVE NEVER

345
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,849
SEEN NASTINESS LIKE WE HAVE

346
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,917
SEEN FROM THESE PEOPLE.

347
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,252
IT'S CRUEL AND NASTY.

348
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,220
THAT'S WHY MY FATHER WENT TO

349
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:01,621
WASHINGTON.

350
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,189
AND THE SWAMP IS DEEP, GUYS.

351
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,991
DEEPER THAN YOU CAN EVER

352
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:05,391
IMAGINE.

353
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,192
STEVE: YOU WERE IN THE SWAMP

354
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:06,559
YESTERDAY.

355
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,927
YOU WERE DOWN IN WASHINGTON

356
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,162
GETTING, YOU KNOW, PROGRESS

357
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:11,097
REPORT FROM OUR NATION'S

358
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:11,430
CAPITAL.

359
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,566
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

360
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,067
WE HAVE SEEN A CHANGE IN THE

361
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:15,802
OUTREACH FROM THE WHITE

362
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,836
HOUSE WHERE WE ARE SEEING A

363
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:17,937
LOT MORE OF YOUR DAD.

364
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,138
HE HAS BEEN ON A LOT OF

365
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,505
CHANNELS.

366
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,274
HE WAS WITH US LAST WEEK FOR

367
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,110
47 MINUTES.

368
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,778
BRIAN: TRISH REGAN, STUART

369
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,179
VARNEY.

370
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,079
STEVE: ALL OVER THE PLACE.

371
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,382
IS IT BECAUSE HE IS OWN BEST

372
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:29,816
SPOKESPERSON.

373
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,651
>> NO QUESTION HE IS HIS OWN

374
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,019
BEST SPOKESPERSON.

375
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,887
HE CARRIES A MESSAGE AND

376
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,354
UNCONVENTIONAL.

377
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,825
PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF

378
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:39,292
CONVENTIONAL.

379
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,493
PERFECTLY MANICURED AND

380
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,828
REHEARSED AND VETTED BY 14

381
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:42,395
LURKS LAWYERS.

382
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,230
HE WILL GO AND SPEAK OF 00

383
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:44,530
CUFF.

384
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,998
