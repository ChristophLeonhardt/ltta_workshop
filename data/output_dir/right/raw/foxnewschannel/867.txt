1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,043
>>  PAUL MANAFORT ARRIVING AT

2
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,446
THE NORTHERN NECK REGIONAL JAIL.

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,781
HE'S THE FIRST CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,617
TO BE JAILED AS PART OF SPECIAL

5
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,219
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,320
INVESTIGATION.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,424
HERE IS THE EDITOR, THANK YOU

8
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,525
FOR JOINING US, BOYD.

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,094
I WANT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR

10
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,162
OUR CONVERSATION.

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,663
WE HAVE THE IG REPORT OUT THIS

12
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,932
WEEK, WHOLLY SEPARATED FROM THE

13
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,201
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, CORRECT?

14
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,737
>> THAT'S CORRECT, LIZ.

15
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,040
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFLATING

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,442
THE WHOLE THING.

17
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,577
AND THE IG REPORT WAS TO THE

18
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,144
PROCESS FOLLOWED.

19
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:46,679
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE A HOST

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,214
OF THINGS, IT'S IRONIC YOU COME

21
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,582
OUT WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS

22
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,617
THAT SHOW BIAS AND THEN THERE IS

23
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,986
NO BIAS IN THE END, SO SORT OF

24
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:53,653
AN INTERESTING LANDING.

25
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,523
ELIZABETH: THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO

26
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,757
SORT OF GO TO MY NEXT QUESTION.

27
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,526
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE

28
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,127
ATTACKING MUELLER FOR A FRESH

29
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,862
ROUND OF ATTACKS ON FRIDAY AS IF

30
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,230
HE HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE.

31
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,333
BUT THAT BEING SAID, A, THESE

32
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,268
INVESTIGATIONS TAKE TIME, BUT

33
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,802
HE'S STARTING TO FEEL THE HEAT

34
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,571
OR HEAR MORE CRITICISMS,

35
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,072
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HEAR FROM

36
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,475
THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY RUDY

37
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:15,842
GUILIANI.

38
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,110
>> RIGHT, AND SO, I THINK THE

39
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,112
INNING YOU'RE SEEING IS THAT

40
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,213
OBVIOUSLY, EVERYONE IS GETTING

41
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,247
ANXIOUS, LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM

42
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,716
OF THIS, TO THE END OF THE

43
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:24,183
INVESTIGATION.

44
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:24,984
THESE INVESTIGATIONS SPEND TENS

45
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,886
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, THEY

46
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,987
CAST VERY WIDE NETS.

47
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,122
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING YET

48
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,590
THAT HAS REALLY PRODUCED

49
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,791
ANYTHING THAT SHOWS ANYTHING

50
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,792
ABOUT COLLUSION.

51
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,761
THERE'S A LOT IN TERMS OF

52
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,728
INTERFERENCE AND WE'VE KNOWN

53
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,764
THAT THE RUSSIANS TRIED TO

54
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,665
INTERFERE AND THIS IS WHERE I

55
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,533
THINK IT ALL LANDS, LIZ.

56
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,101
WHAT HAPPENS, WE END UP WITH

57
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,170
THIS DISTRUST, THIS DIVISION AND

58
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,271
DIVISIVE RHETORIC AROUND IT,

59
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,373
WHICH IS WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT,

60
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:47,807
BY THE WAY.

61
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,876
BUT THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT IT

62
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,544
ALSO CREATES DISTRUST IN THE

63
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,211
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

64
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:53,780
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE ONE

65
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,982
THING WE HAVEN'T TALKED ENOUGH

66
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,084
ABOUT IS THIS UNDERMINING PUBLIC

67
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:58,451
TRUST.

68
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,219
OUR TRUST IN OUR GOVERNMENT

69
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,021
INSTITUTIONS HAS NEVER BEEN

70
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,823
LOWER, BUT THAT'S ALSO SPREADING

71
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,726
OVER AND STARTING TO FRAY THE

72
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,127
FABRIC OF SOCIETY.

73
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,062
IT USED TO BE WHEN PEOPLE ASKED

74
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,831
IF YOUR NEIGHBOR TRUSTWORTHY, 68

75
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,434
OR 70% WOULD SAY YES, NOW ONLY

76
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,970
22% SO WE'RE BECOMING MUCH MORE

77
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,304
TRIBAL, MUCH MORE DISTRUSTFUL

78
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,505
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO

79
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,473
UNDERMINE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

80
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,342
AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE

81
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,811
HAVE TO ADDRESS AND WHILE THE IG

82
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,412
REPORT IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE

83
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,314
THAT'S THE PROCESS PIECE THAT

84
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,716
SHOULD GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

85
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,551
TRUST THAT WHATEVER THE MUELLER

86
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,652
INVESTIGATION COMES UP WITH,

87
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,287
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE STOCK

88
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,822
IN IT THAT IT IS TRUSTWORTHY.

89
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,090
ELIZABETH: YOU KNOW, AND I AGREE

90
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,523
WITH YOU.

91
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:40,493
I WANT TO PLAY A QUICK SOUND

92
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,795
BITE FROM CHRISTOPHER WRAY NOW

93
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,330
LEADING THE FBI.

94
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,634
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN WHAT HE

95
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,268
SAID BECAUSE I THINK IT GOES

96
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:50,169
ALONG NICELY.

97
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,904
>> WE TAKE THIS REPORT VERY

98
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,172
SERIOUSLY AND WE ACCEPT ITS

99
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,008
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

100
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,609
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THOUGH TO

101
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,344
NOTE WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

102
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,213
DID NOT FIND.

103
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,683
THIS REPORT DID NOT FIND ANY

104
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,486
EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS OR

105
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,921
IMPROPER CONSIDERATIONS ACTUALLY

106
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,390
IMPACTING THE INVESTIGATION

107
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,691
UNDER REVIEW.

108
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,725
ELIZABETH: YOU CAN ALREADY SEE

109
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,960
SORT OF THE CAMPAIGN TO SAY,

110
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,230
LOOK IT, TRUST US, WE ARE --

111
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,665
THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE TRYING TO

112
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,100
DO WHAT THEY ARE HIRED TO DO.

113
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,268
THAT BEING SAID AS WE CONTINUE

114
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,671
ON THIS INVESTIGATION, IF WE DO

115
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,372
SEE, LET'S SAY A SUBPOENA FOR

116
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,940
THE PRESIDENT, WHERE IS THIS

117
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,241
GOING?

118
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,842
>> YEAH, I THINK THE TRUST

119
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,843
FACTOR IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO

120
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,446
BE THE PROBLEM.

121
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,580
REMEMBER WHAT WE HEARD FROM

122
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,115
COMEY, GOING THROUGH HIS PART,

123
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,050
AND EVEN WITH HILLARY CLINTON,

124
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,118
HE SAID THERE'S ALL OF THESE BAD

125
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,186
THINGS, AWFUL THINGS, BUT TRUST

126
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,088
ME, THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

127
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,124
SO I THINK FOR THE IG TO GO

128
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,527
THROUGH THAT SAME PATH, THERE'S

129
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,195
BIAS, THERE'S BIAS, THERE'S

130
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:53,466
NOTHING TO SEE HERE THAT'S PART

131
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,067
OF THE CHALLENGE.

132
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,802
AND IT'S FASCINATING ON MONDAY,

133
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,303
WHAT VIEWERS SHOULD BE WATCHING

134
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,539
FOR AS HE APPEARS BEFORE THE

135
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,474
SENATE COMMITTEE FIRST, WHAT IT

136
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:01,941
REALLY MEANS.

137
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,177
IT'S A CHANCE FOR THE IG TO SAY,

138
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,411
YES, THERE IS TRUST AND WE NEED

139
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,479
TO WATCH THIS MOVING FORWARD.

140
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,880
I THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE

141
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,282
SENATE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

142
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,017
AISLE THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE

143
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,219
TOUGH QUESTIONS ROLLING INTO

144
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:13,553
MONDAY.

145
00:04:13,553 --> 00:00:00,000
ELIZABETH: ALL RIGHT, BOYD
