on Monday protests broke out across the nation over the shooting of Terrence Crutcher 40 year old black man from Tulsa Oklahoma Crutcher was shot by white officer after 9 1 1 calls identified him as a man who had abandoned his car in the middle of the road and appeared to be on drugs he had a history of drug crimes and gun crimes Crutcher did disobey police orders but he had his hands up before he approached his vehicle then he sort of lowered his hands and was shot the police are undertaking a full investigation of course the officer will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law if the tape is representative of the events that occurred then on Tuesday a black officer from Charlotte North Carolina shot and killed a 43 year old black guy named Keith Lamont Scott in a university city apartment parking lot the police had been looking for somebody with an outstanding warrant when they saw Scott leave his car with a gun after Scott got back in the car the police approached him at which point he emerged with the gun and quote posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject and killing him the cops called the medic who began performing CPR despite the apparent fact that Scott was armed and tried to do something the officers his daughter released a video online and saying that he was unarmed that he was reading a book while waiting for his son to be let off the school bus and that he was disabled which is a great story except none of it is actually supported by any of the facts that we've seen Scott's death prompted a race riot in Charlotte 12 officers injured including seven hospitalized one struck in the face by a rock the rioters didn't merely attack cops they were throwing rocks and bottles from freeway overpasses onto drivers below they also looted a Walmart as a protest for some reason and they injured three reporters including one who had to be hospitalized the black lives matter movement has been an utter disaster for the country it's based on a provable lie that unarmed black people are disproportionately shot by the cops it assumes Americans also don't care if unarmed black people are shot by the cops but it actually does a disservice to innocent black people who do die at the hands of cops by lumping them in with purported victims who aren't victims at all it's utterly unfair to lump in Walter Scott shot in the back in South Carolina with Michael Brown a thug who attempted to murder a police officer but that's what black lives matter does every single day driving riots from Ferguson to Baltimore and in doing so they undermine any effort toward racial unity Americans are willing to mourn the death of innocence in fact we do more than the death of innocents but we're not willing to pillory in situations in which they use justified force on suspects BLM black lives matter they assume that cops are always wrong invariably so to leftist politicians like Hillary Clinton who continue to pander to leftist black voters by lying about the cops and the mentality that cops are the bad guys has predictable consequences more people who are anti cop including 25 year old Nicholas Glen a black man who shot two officers in Philadelphia on Friday including a black female police officer and left behind a note speaking of his quote hatred for police and probation officers according to the Philadelphia Enquirer I just can't understand the reckless disregard or disrespect for law enforcement said John McCain SB who's the president for the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge number five I've never seen it at such a level at it is today patron and slander of the police are horrifying and disgusting but they're common in leftist politics today and they prevent the country from coming together to protect both innocent people and the cops who defend them i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty so welcome to the show we're doing this obviously from a hotel near some college that I've heard of some University called yalla yeah Lou Yael Yael that's what it is we're gonna be speaking there tonight and we'll be talking with all the precious snowflakes at Yale in just about a couple of hours here so that's exciting so if you're near Yale for some reason and you want to come out it's free and it should be a blast if you want to stream it online I know that the young America's Foundation is also streaming it online and we have some some interesting things planned okay but first before we go any further we want to mention one of our great sponsors helix sleep he looks like this great sponsor what they do is you go on their website at helix sleep helix sleep comm slash Ben you go to helix sleep comm slash Ben and when you do you go through their questioning process about do you like your mattress firm do you like it to be cool or do you get the hot at night dude you are you are you cold at night and then they customize a mattress for you what's really cool is that if you're a couple and one of you likes the bed softer and one of you likes the bed harder they'll actually customize a mattress that's harder on one side and softer on the other side and then they mail you the mattress it arrives at your door in about a week shipping is 100% free and then if you don't like it you try it out for a hundred days and if you don't like it they'll pick it up for free and they'll give you a 100% refund instead so it really is no risk and you can try it see if you like it it's really cool it comes in a box you open up the box and then it just inflates right in front of you which is really neat and I've slept on it it's incredibly comfortable I'm really grateful to Hilux for sending me the mattress because I'm sleeping better because of that matrix so it's helix sleep calm and the mattresses are very very affordable it's hundreds of dollars instead of thousands of dollars we got a king size mattress and and that thing was like 995 bucks which is a lot cheaper than it would be for an equally sized really nice mattress somewhere else so it's it's fantastic comes right to your door enough to schlep at home

you have the honor of knowing that you helped out the show because obviously they advertise with us that we bring them clients and if you're one of the clients better shot that all the all the deplorable zz behind the camera here it gets remain employed okay so lots going on in the world latest thing is Hillary Clinton has real problems in this election cycle the polls are showing that this is way too close for comfort 538 particularly fivethirtyeight.com particularly is now showing that Hillary's chances of winning which used to be near 80 percent are now all the way down to 56% that's if the election is held November 8th if the election were held today should be at 51% Trump would be at 49 that's how close this election is and that's according to five thirty eight.com and they do all of this comprehensive poll analysis that means for Hillary she's looking around and she's thinking to herself how do I get more people out to vote how do I get my people out to vote and by my people out to vote she really means the Obama coalition which specifically means lots of minorities out to vote lots of minority leftist out to vote that's what she's really interested in pushing that's that's her big thing well one of the way she's gonna do this is by race baiting she's gonna pander racially this is very important to her she must pander racially and so what we saw we talked about Terrence Crutcher and that shooting in Tulsa we showed the tape yesterday it looked like a bad shoot but as we see more information we'll find out apparently Terrence Crutcher had PCP in his car which may explain why he didn't respond to a Taser but he was tased and shot at the same time so it's possible that it's a bad shoot even if he was not obeying officer commands you don't get shot for disobeying officer commands you should do it it's going to increase your chances of not getting shot but as rule you're not gonna get shot if you if you don't actually provide an imminent threat to the officers but the real story today is what's happening in Charlotte so twelve officers injured seven of them wounded enough to go to the hospital one was really wounded hit in the face by a rock these these so-called protesters these pieces of crap they were throwing bricks and rocks off the freeway overpasses trying to kill people and then they were and then they were breaking into Walmart so here's some of the protesters and what they were doing last night after let me give you the details the case they don't play the tapes the details the case as I mentioned in the intro here the details of the case are that the the supposed victim in this case was a guy who the police went to an apartment complex to try and search down a guy who had an outstanding warrant this was not that guy but the guy decided to pop out of his car anyway with gun and and they shot him dead the the guy is I think it's his daughter she then posted online something about how he was unarmed and he was just sitting there reading a book he was probably reading you know something deep like Aristotle or Plato and he was waiting for his son to get off the school bus and they shot him dead for no reason turns out none of that is true the black police chief in charlotte-mecklenburg he says that's not true he was an eminent threat he pulled the gun on the officers in any case all of this goes down and the protesters emerge to throw rocks at passing cars because that's what we do now and here are the protesters doing their best to really make a difference from race relations by breaking into the local Walmart so you can see them really doing things that protestors are our fond of doing the things that are really important and and then just do that they also I decided would be fun to jump up and down on a police cruisers does that look like me right now because we're looking at live pictures of Sky 3 and Paul you and I are boasting this everybody watching is saying this maybe 25 people on top of a sea MPD cruiser looks like SUV windshields are cracked shattered people on the roof kicking in the side windows you can see very clearly that that was a violent act against the patrol car we had not seen a lot of violence up until this point and had remained tense but relatively calm and this picture is quite different Paul moments ago see MPD also tweeted out that agitators had joined this crowd of protesters it had been peaceful up to this point and once again sky 3 has it's a searchlight on there the police helicopter as well they have cracked the front windshield by stomping on it they've been on top of this car again we saw some of the smoke bombs go off just a few minutes ago it is pretty much a bit of chaos going on I thought for a moment the crowd might be dispersing but we can see that it is moved up the street away from where Sarah Blake Morgan was standing just a few minutes ago and this is a much wilder scene of folks here who are fairly angry a fear in these situations and not even yeah fairly angry relevant and and those people are really doing the Lord's work I mean if you look at them and doing what they're doing it's clear that what they're really what they're really angry about is clearly cop racism by the way the cop who shot the black guy is black but no matter no matter all cops are racist all cops are evil and we learned this from the brother of the supposed victim in this case here's tape of the brother of the supposed to victim and here's what he had to say to all of the white folks out there I think we should know just know that all white people are Devils oh it seems to me after watching that the wise white racism is really the problem here I mean I watched that and I go white racism seriously there's no such thing as black racism there isn't I mean this is what I've heard from Marc Lamont Hill I've heard this from other leftist commentators there is no Stu person they just don't exist their myths they're just in your mind they're like unicorns you know and of course that's not true maybe one of the reasons that the cops are having a hard time in black communities is because there are people like this guy who thinks that all black people are wonderful presumably and all white people are Devils I still don't know what he's talking about considering the guy who shot his brother was actually a black guy but I guess he becomes white the minute he puts on a police uniform so this is wonderful and then thankfully we have Hillary Clinton here to really make sure that we can tamp all of this down Hillary does the responsible thing you know earlier this week we saw Hillary Clinton say that we wouldn't want to be irresponsible about any of this we have to be very very responsible in not jumping to conclusions remember she ripped Donald Trump apart because Donald Trump called a bombing a bombing before she wanted him to call a bombing a bombing now now though it's important that we jump to conclusion so Hillary tweets something out here's what Hillary tweets is Hillary's tweet can we put that up so Hillary's tweet suggests equivalence between Terrence Crutcher between Terrence Crutcher and and this and this other shooting victim in in North Carolina who really isn't a victim he's actually a perpetrator he's actually the problem the Hillary tweet is is is exactly what it looks like right it's just a way for her to lump together all shooting all shootings under the banner of their racist and wrongful even though again there's no evidence that any of this was racist and wrongful because that's what Hillary Clinton has to do she's now going to do the full lefty routine she's now going to suggest that all shootings by cops are bad right she wrote keith Lamont Scott turns Crutcher to many others this has got to end - age when she has the - age that means that she personally wrote it right it wasn't one of her staffers she personally wrote it because she is a deeply special and wonderful human being the worst stuff ever I mean first of all there's no evidence that either shooting was racially based even the one in Tulsa no evidence that this is a race-based shooting second the Scotch shooting may well have been justified given all of the facts that we currently know that's not the only thing that Hillary had to say about this here was Hillary on the on The Steve Harvey Show when Steve Harvey isn't laughing at the word penis over and over on his on his ridiculous family feud show he does a radio show that isn't very good and here's Steve Harvey talking about about with Hillary Clinton about race we've got a tackle systemic racism this horrible shooting again how many times do we have to see this in our country in Tulsa an unarmed man with his hands in the air I mean this is just unbearable and it needs to be intolerable and so you know maybe I can by speaking directly to white people say look this is not who we are we've got to do everything possible to improve policing okay screw you Hillary Clinton screw you this is absurdity of the highest level your guns gonna go between for the white community you're gonna lecture the white community because the white community wants to see innocent black people die that's the idea here you're going to lecture all of us on morality you have to make an unacceptable I have a question who out there anybody cheering I want an unarmed black man gets shot who aren't people who just say that they want to go to the black community and then and then shoot everybody just shoot all the unarmed people that they can possibly find nobody is saying that but Hillary claims that's what's being said Hillary claims that the way this is supposed to go is that the white people like went under and black people are shot and the black people are just the innocent victims every time there's a cop shooting again the idea that she's gonna lecture all of us is just in say she continued by the way she said maybe I can by speaking directly to white people say look this is not who we are we've got to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias let me say something at implicit bias so the left likes to talk a lot about what they call implicit bias training something about implicit bias training okay the idea of implicit bias the idea that that we all have this bias in the back of our mind and that's why cops are shooting black people there's no evidence that implicit bias affects behavior is the dirty little secret about implicit bias studies there's also no evidence and any sort of police training program gets rid of the implicit bias there's no evidence of that whatsoever so it's just all of this is just crap and hilary spouts out there she just spouts out there so that she can pander to black people and hope that they all show up in mass number she's trying to play the Obama card the Cambridge police acted stupidly card the Ferguson police have to be investigated in car she's trying to play Obama and she's failing and for her to say that she's gonna lecture the the white community about how to treat black people I mean again the Clintons are not exactly famous for being perfectly wonderful about black folks they have a long history of antipathy toward the Obama family for example and a lot of people in the black community who aren't particularly happy with Hillary's verbiage about black criminals back in the 1990s but Hillary's gonna lecture the rest of us about how we're supposed to treat black people because she is the great moral arbiter of our time how disgusting she's and we know that she's a great moral arbiter we know that she's a great moral arbiter because we know that she is the one who is going to tell all the white people to start caring about dead black people she's the great moral arbiter because she believes that all police shootings are equivalent whether the person is innocent or whether they're not in a sense it's an all just evidence of the systemic white racism it really is very gross okay take a break really quickly to say hello to our friends over at Birch gold so if you wanted to purchase

friends are birchgold.com / Ben ok so Donald Trump reacts to all of this and Donald Trump you know he reacts by first of all he came out today and he said that the Tulsa tape disturbed him I think the Tulsa State disturbed everybody it disturbed me too he went on and said that it looked like a bad shoot he actually went further than that he went a little bit too far in my opinion without waiting for all of the facts but Trump continued by saying the black communities are in the worst shape they've ever been so here's Trump's response to all of the all the race baiting Hillary Clinton is doing we're gonna make our country safe again we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our african-american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before ever ever ever you take a look at the inner cities you get no education you get no jobs you get shot walking down the street they're worse I mean honestly places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities okay so this is this is Trump overstating the case the problem is if you're trying to actually woo black votes you don't tell them that every place that they live is a terrible place what you say is too many of our too many of these cities are are are dangerous too many of these cities are terrible places to live but he's speaking to quality of life he's speaking to quality of the life issues at the same time that Hillary is the quality of life issues what he's saying is closer to the truth than what Hillary is saying Hillary is saying we don't have a quality of life issue we have a white cop issue we have a white racism issue and I just returned back to that clip of this this North Carolina guy's brother the guy got shot his brother saying that all white people are Devils and I would suggest the problem is not the white people the problem might be a pathology within certain segments of the black community that says that we are allowed to be lawless if we so choose and that the white community is to blame for that that's not all black people that's not even the majority of black people that's not even the majority of black people living in high crime areas but there is a certain group of people who think that the white man is to blame for all of the racial problems in America and that's really disgusting because if we all just acted decently black white and green we'd all be a hell of a lot better now as we continue here on the bench P Rochelle we're gonna continue over at Dailey wire.com if you want to watch the rest of the show live go to daily wire calm right
