1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,980
This is Al Nashabiya,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,240
It was the first city to be liberated by the Syrian Arab Army

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,740
since the start of military operations three weeks ago In Ghouta

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,560
This city was heavily fortified

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,400
it was considered an advanced line towards the eastern side of Ghouta

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,280
it took several days to liberate it,

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,760
but the defeat of the terrorists was great,

8
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:40,220
the liberation of Al Nashabiya allowed the liberation of the rest of Ghouta

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,500
Here we can see civilians beginning to clean schools,

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,240
they are not employees,

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:00,000
but this indicates a high level of [public] consciousness.
