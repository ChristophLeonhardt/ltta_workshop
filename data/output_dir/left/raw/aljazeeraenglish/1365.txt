4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,570
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece about the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for it so it was kind of funny working</font>

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,100
with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they were they were</font>

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
less worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the writing than</font>

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,900
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the the image so they</font>

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,430
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send them three sketches</font>

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,199
and suddenly I felt like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for my editor again you know but it was</font>

46
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,520
cartoon was

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very tasteful way to do something</font>

48
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">about about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stormy Daniel situation</font>

49
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,860
which some could look at and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">very lurid topic and I just drew a a</font>

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,160
storm cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> labeled stormy Daniels and</font>

52

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,450
he's he<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of he's saying I've never</font>

seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud before but it better not</font>

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,650
break our non precipitation agreement

56
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I also thought the non precipitation</font>

57
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,530
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a funny gag this cartoon was drawn</font>

58
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,810
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time when Austin was going</font>

59
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,709
through the bombings

60
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening and the FBI had been</font>

61
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,980
instrumental and helping out down there

62
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,900
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the bombings</font>

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,209
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know keeping people safe and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

64
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,250
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> drew a woman saying you're</font>

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,170
surprisingly brave for a crooked

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,560
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and what some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the news</font>

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">stations were talking about this deep</font>

71
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,579
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIA and so I just felt like it was a</font>

72
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,440
way to point out the ridiculous nature

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that conspiracy theory and and I'm</font>

74
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">not exactly sure why they killed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

75
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,049
except that except<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm referencing</font>

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that Trump talked about this</font>

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,069
deep<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay this cartoon I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

78
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,810
drawing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cartoon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I just</font>

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,410
liked showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a showing Trump who is who</font>

80
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,959
sort of a blobby mass<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway when you</font>

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,359
see him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just show him even blobby</font>

82
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">err and and and melting away but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

83
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,090
also you know I grew up watching The

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,739
Wizard<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Oz it's one of my favorite</font>

85
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,440
movies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of make</font>

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,810
that parallel here and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump</font>

87
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that was calling this a</font>

88

witch hunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever and ever and and this</font>

89
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,569
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-year anniversary of</font>

90
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,419
Mueller's investigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> so he tweeted</font>

91
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,819
out about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know he did he did</font>

92
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:51,959
tweet out something similar

93
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,000
congratulations were we're now in the

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,440
second year<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the greatest witch hunt</font>

95
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,450
in American history<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I added</font>

96
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,459
what a world what a world<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

the Wicked Witch says that she's melting

98
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,590
and and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a fun way to</font>

99
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,479
address sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ridiculous nature of</font>

and calling it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> witch-hunt and and they</font>

103
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">just didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it they said that you</font>

104
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,680
know they tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to insult the cartoon</font>

105
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,110
and say that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dated reference</font>

106
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,050
and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it wasn't a good</font>

107
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,930
cartoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> so but the readers liked it and</font>

108
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good response from it so</font>

109
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,060
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just didn't like</font>

110
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the content so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cartoon I drew right</font>

111
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">after the NFL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made the statement that</font>

117
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,250
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know they were distorting</font>

118
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,410
the whole reason for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kneeling for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Colin Kaepernick you know which was</font>

basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> about saying we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to value</font>

124
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,340
Trump<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped distort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this issue by some</font>

of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweets and by saying you know</font>

126
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,480
that they were unpatriotic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that they</font>

127
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,270
were hurting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> troops somehow so so I</font>

128
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,919
figured I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do these new NFL</font>

129
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,930
penalties you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have illegal use of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,100
troops and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then prompting unnecessary</font>

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,470
roughage from Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> all penalties now</font>

133
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,169
under the NFL I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

134
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,720
last this<font color="#CCCCCC"> last part they just didn't</font>

135
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a true statement about</font>

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,100
Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and they decided that that</font>

137
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't going to run this was the second</font>

138
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,700
one this was supposed to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sunday</font>

139
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,440
before Memorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> Day and you know Trump</font>

140
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">in his usual way had been had been</font>

141
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,300
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> lies that at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every turn so I</font>

142
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,210
decided that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that rather than be putting</font>

143
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,340
the wreath on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tomb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the unknown I</font>

144
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,980
figured he could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting it on the</font>

145
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,450
tomb of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the known which is the things</font>

146
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing which is lying and</font>

147
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have truth honor and</font>

148
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,520
rule of law<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he's and he's putting</font>

149
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wreath and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> r.i.p on that</font>

150
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,479
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

151
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,939
and during his presidency<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I know</font>

152
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,620
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard-hitting image and I</font>

153
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,110
know that it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running the day</font>

154
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">before Memorial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Day which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

155
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,900
sacred day for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> observing you know</font>

156
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,620
the loved ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have passed</font>

157
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,039
especially those in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service and and</font>

158
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
so I kind of I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of had an inkling</font>

159
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they might not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this one but</font>

160
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,490
but I still thought they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might run it</font>

161
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's a I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a very</font>

162
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong cartoon so this is another</font>

163
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">cartoon that involves the NFL but it</font>

164
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">also references the Starbucks issue</font>

165
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,389
where they where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they called the police</font>

166
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,990
on the on the on the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> African</font>

167
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Americans who are having coffee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or who</font>

168
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,159
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying anything but who were in</font>

169
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,860
the store and it became a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue and</font>

170
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,870
so they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a day where they</font>

171
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,490
would close<font color="#E5E5E5"> the store</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and have racial</font>

172
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitivity training at the same time</font>

173
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,399
the NFL was saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to not</font>

174
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,889
let you protest<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on racial issues</font>

175
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,499
so we're gonna we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be closed for</font>

176
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">racial ignorance training and I thought</font>

177
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,029
it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good comparison</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it made</font>

178
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,039
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted to make and it</font>

179
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,249
didn't involve<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump at all I mean but</font>

180
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,520
because the NFL and and you know because

181
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">because Trump had been involved in that</font>

182
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,969
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> NFL thing and he had sort of</font>

183
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:39,370
inserted himself into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

184
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this created a problem for for my</font>

185
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,800
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my publisher now the other thing</font>

186
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,919
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've started to notice is that</font>

187
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,209
if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these cartoons</font>

188
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have been killed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not all</font>

189
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">about Trump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

190
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">about racism and I feel like maybe I was</font>

191
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,719
touching a nerve<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that they were</font>

192
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">uncomfortable with they had just run an</font>

193
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,379
editorial<font color="#CCCCCC"> in January</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defended</font>

194
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,129
Trump's<font color="#E5E5E5"> racist comments about those</font>

195
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries those blank whole countries</font>

196
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,699
and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a lot of</font>

197
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,469
flack for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had media</font>

198
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,080
organizations all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

199
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">know denouncing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what they wrote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

200
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,060
think they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to defend it so I</font>

201
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,349
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were very</font>

202
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">sensitive to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two issues where that</font>

203
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,419
called out people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for racial</font>

204
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">insensitivity</font>

205
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,360
so it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

206
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,458
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second cartoon that I drew this</font>

207
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,740
day the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first cartoon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

208
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,649
sketches<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see inside and and</font>

209
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,959
this was my second<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea about the</font>

210
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">Roseanne incident and and after they</font>

211
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,720
killed the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea I thought okay</font>

212
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,029
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was this was about her her</font>

213
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,860
comments about<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it was the ambien</font>

214
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,899
that made me say<font color="#E5E5E5"> these crazy things and</font>

215
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,120
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just imagined in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my mind you know</font>

216
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,389
that's this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny image of a</font>

217
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Klansman sitting in the doctor's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> office</font>

218
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,949
and and imagining him saying well MIT

219
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:14,569
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be the ambien you know that</font>

220
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,149
made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> racist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought I thought</font>

221
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's funny there's no reference to</font>

222
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">Trump</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just taking this this issue</font>

223
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,990
of Roseanne<font color="#E5E5E5"> and boiling it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down to</font>

224
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is a comment on</font>

225
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">where racist beliefs come from how we</font>

226
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,889
excuse them away sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> as either as</font>

227
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,079
either just joking around or oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

228
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:38,779
me because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was I was you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know too</font>

229
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,240
tired or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was on ambien or something</font>

230
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,970
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I wanted to kind of point</font>

231
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,860
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the ludicrous nature of that</font>

232
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,790
excuse and originally the the the editor

233
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,559
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh of the editorial director said</font>

234
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,600
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're gonna run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this after he</font>

235
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,089
killed the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it was on</font>

236
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:01,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">the page it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be printed and</font>

237
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,750
the publisher decided after after I had

238
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,230
already sort of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to do</font>

239
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">other things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he had decided to sub it</font>

240
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,209
for another syndicated well actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

241
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:16,519
the he decided to use another Roseanne

242
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,620
cartoon in its place one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was drawn</font>

243
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,600
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toledo cartoonist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our sister</font>

244
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">paper and he said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he liked it better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

245
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,889
he so he subbed it out and and there was

246
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">no reason to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

247
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:30,740
why he did it

248
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,420
I think this cartoon was better than the

249
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,620
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> he put in so this was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font>

250
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,290
cartoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was killed during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that week</font>

251
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,759
and this was when Trump had decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

252
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">pardon you know Martha Stewart</font>

253
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,050
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the other pardons he</font>

254
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,630
had made<font color="#CCCCCC"> already like Sheriff Arpaio I</font>

255
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,540
just felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he was he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

256
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,210
of pardoning everybody just to make a

257
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know just to say hey I can do</font>

258
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm the president you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I can I</font>

259
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,190
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think he was</font>

260
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to send Trump was trying to send</font>

261
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,330
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people like Flynn and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Manta</font>

262
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,890
fort and an even Cohen<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly that hey</font>

263
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,440
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can pardon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys so I decided it</font>

264
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,960
sort of was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bakery or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a butcher</font>

265
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,790
shop where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

266
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,960
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I made it take a pardon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

267
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,550
again this is a cartoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that I</font>

268
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,340
don't think is out of bounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all I</font>

269
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,590
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's overly harsh to Trump</font>

270
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,690
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was it was</font>

271
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they killed that week</font>

272
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,580
they just decided no and so they this

273
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,990
was the final one they killed in that

274
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">six in a row this was the second to the</font>

275
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">last cartoon I drew that week</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I</font>

276
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,510
had to draw this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one pretty fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

277
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,910
I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent the morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> composing an</font>

278
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,910
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my publisher and my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> editor</font>

279
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,920

280
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">killing all these cartoons in a row I'm</font>

281
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing my job</font>

282
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,580
I've been here 25 years and so I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent</font>

283
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,020
so much time working on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> letter that</font>

284
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I suddenly realized oh my gosh it's</font>

285
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,130
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> late in the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

286
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to draw a cartoon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I came up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

287
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,530
this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

288
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,910
the big story of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

289
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,040
they were separating<font color="#CCCCCC"> children from their</font>

290
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">families</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the border and I and I</font>

291
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,540
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing these Caltrans signs in</font>

292
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,850
California and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other border and so I</font>

293
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,190
I decided to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image and</font>

294
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,680
usually in the in the original image on

295
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,200

the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mother's hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as they're running</font>

297
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I decided well in this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump is</font>

298
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,260
reaching in and pulling the child<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,360
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">better sign because it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still a</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this so I thought well this</font>
