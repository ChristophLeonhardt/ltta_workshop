our older going life we're just looking at wardrobe here checking out some presses checking out some dresses cuz you know not like Michaels metrosexual at all no not little old me but I'm Alicia Krause I'm Michael Knowles this is Friday live thank you guys for tuning in and watching let's first recap uh there's still a buzz or people are on Twitter mm-hm over who wrote the anonymous New York Times op-ed that's right and I think that I I don't know you think that it might have been Trump himself oh I could totally see it being Trump I'm beginning to think after Cory Booker's craziness at the Senate beginning to think it was t-bone might have just been Cory Booker's old friend from Newark you know is completely fictional character that's kind of that I'm beginning to think that's who wrote it what do we think so Ann Coulter had an interesting theory this week she said she thinks it's Jared Kushner mmm and but the majority of our fans that wrote in via Instagram YouTube Facebook everything they think that it was a New York Times and it was totally made-up total fake news you know if it were Jared it would have had to correspond I think more with when that leaked comment came out from President Trump about how he could have had Tom Brady as a son-in-law I don't know the timing just doesn't quite add up here I don't know or he held on to it Bev said on Facebook maybe Bill Clinton teamed up with James Patterson again someone else said oh gosh someone said maybe John McCain and it was his last again too soon someone actually this is a legitimate John Huntsman listen you know I'm a little partial here cuz I worked for John Huntsman oh yes campaign I don't think John Huntsman would have done it because I mean he comes from a I get I suppose a more moderate rhetorical wing of the Republican Party but he's a loyal guy he's a very loyal guy and all my experience with him I don't think he would have done it especially after I mean he was loyal to Trump even through the whole kim jeong-hoon North Korea summit all those changed up because he is our ambassador over there and so I'm kind of surprised and what would he stand to gain from it you know he's run for president again he's not right you know running in 2020 that's for sure he's not he's got a very important diplomatic position I I don't buy it okay so we talked about noir McDonald last week a little bit unintentionally because we're both fan I always show was out today right Jacob mm-hm so the show that Norm Macdonald has a show MacDonald has a show the best title ever I think Norma Connell has a show is now streaming live on Netflix and our question to you this week is do you think that Netflix wound up canceling it or pulling it because there's been some new hubbub with Norm Macdonald this week I mean he's been on this media blitz was on the view Howard Stern was it Hollywood Reporter ditto in depth interview with him and in that interview he said some stuff what do you say so he I knew that they were gonna try to cancel his show by the way I don't think norm is some rock-ribbed conservative Republican or I think it I think people project that onto him because he's not a whack of lefty but I don't I think he what he is as a comedian who tells jokes and which is so bizarre these days in our Nannette world where comedy isn't comedy anymore it's supposed to be not funny yeah but anyway he does this interview and I knew they were gonna try to cancel the show I didn't know they would try to cancel it before it premiered but he said they asked him what do you think about Roseanne Barr and he said Oh Roseanne spent a friend of mine for decades she gave me my first job okay he's been like we wrote the foreword to his book and he said you know they both they both really you know they apologized they they said they were wrong what they did was wrong and I'm glad to see them back on their feet something to that effect and he also mentioned that he thought he spoke to Roseanne the day after her tweet and he said that she was crying and he was worried about her and he said maybe you should reach out to louis c.k because i haven't been through this before but somebody like him has right maybe go to him for advice that's right yeah that's what people were like jumping all over there jumping all over this and they're you know they're they're basically just looking for an excuse I don't you know I don't think even if he had given the interview and said I think tuna salad is really good with mayonnaise they would have said Donald Trump likes mayonnaise well white-supremacist do we got a cancellation show for the record I do not like Mayo what it's gross Wow it's only gonna fit today only not see I'm trying to figure out what version racism that I don't know that's very complicated but they're gonna they're gonna try to get him for it so he's a today you mean like the SJW snowflake left that's exactly they don't like I mean Netflix executives haven't come out and said anything no but which is interesting Norma Donald is one of the last living comedian last true comedians and he's certainly the greatest living comedian and you got to remember Netflix and the left have embraced Nanette nobody watched Nanette I had to suffer through it it's a comedy special where the girl says I will not tell jokes I'm just gonna talk about my pain and that's what comedy is now which just as a matter of definitions of words that is not what comedy is that behind everything there's a hint of truth and that's why it's funny yeah and that's why it's awkward and that's why not everyone in an audience will we all be laughing at the same time ask me why I'm so good at comedy timing why did I fall for that every time I am a blonde folks but I try not to be dumb and then I just fall for that crap seriously okay so moving along moving along can't wait to see norms Hollywood throwdown you would like this cuz it's a girl fight between Debra Messing and Susan Sarandon oh it's like the iran-iraq war I want them both to lose their bickering over who doesn't like Trump more this one's great so did you see the tweets they saw some of the tweets but it was just like good lady fighting and I just wasn't that interested yeah Debra right Debra Messing who is the weakest link in that new movie about the girl on Facebook I don't know if I forget that I love it but she searching searching yeah it's a great movie and she kinda isn't great in it but okay that's that's neither here nor there okay she sends out this to obviously most known from Will and Grace and when they did the Will and Grace reboot she had her little diva moment because she said that she regretted talking to megyn kelly right yeah that's right she is she so she's this television actress she's fine on TV and she sent out the street and said STFU let you guess what that one means Susan Sarandon you you because Susan Sarandon famously didn't endorse Hillary she didn't like Hillary huge pretty big baby fan she's awful so she says Susan you because you were an Tyler you let this catastrophe happen where children are now being ripped from their parents fu the irony of course is that the child policy the child separation policy was actually begun under the administration of Hillary Clinton's husband never mezack you didn't vote for the wife of the guy who started that I didn't see any response from Susan Sarandon which is probably probably the they always say like the enemy of your enemy is your friend mm-hmm so both of them don't like Trump then how come they're not on the same team well because the left is in at war with one another right now the people focus on the fights within the right and there are some fights though I mean the left is burning itself to the ground the Democratic Party isn't burning itself to the ground right now we shouldn't lose sight of that and it's it's a great one because it is you're just watching them and you think like Who am I gonna root for I'm gonna root for whoever's losing so that I can just so that by the end it's just a pile of ash in the woke this you will never be woken up that's right like you might be the less eaten mm-hmm but you will be eaten will never be welcomed the serpent will get young it's gonna happen so our final topic this week is Lena Dunham so the hubbub was on social media yesterday Tess Holliday who of course is a probably the most famous plus-size supermodel out there was tweeting this company that came out with this shirt that Lena Dunham worked with this company named revolve to do and it was supposed to be a body a body positivity sweatshirt that only retails for $200 because of course now it's a sweatshirt I like my shopping experiences tend to be more positive when it's like 20 bucks or less I'll go to those discount stores I don't care if one sleeve is a little bit longer than the other I mean I think the lamp from the from the dumpster the other day it's like my Oklahoma redneck coming out I'm like la style dumpster diving yeah that was my house by the way that you were done yeah really nice markets and thrift stores so I would never spend $200 if I'm gonna spend $200 I mean I put that in a plastic surgery fun right I like this is the body positivity sweatshirt that retails that revolve for 200 bucks and the worked with lena dunham to style it and she took specific messages that were negative messages directed towards famous women on social so they were like troll comments so she wanted to troll the trolls by creating this 200 and this was very confusing because like the one comment was that isn't beautiful it's just an excuse and so it's a body positivity campaign that's actually focuses on negativity from Twitter on a sweatshirt there are depths of hipster meta virtue signaling that I cannot play I can't understand how far down that goes and then the big controversy is they put the that I'm putting the sweatshirt on a plus-size model they put it on like a size zero Victoria Secret looking well the fat shaming negativity body positivity sweatshirt didn't go on a fat woman but a very very thin woman which are we supposed to recognize sighs I don't see sighs like I don't sighs I don't see that like why can't it be on a double-0 person that's white like if you had put it on an overweight model wouldn't that have been like to a little on the nose a little mean you know it would have been cruel like to have it I just don't get this but everyone is pissed off about it I don't get it Lena Dunham has since apologized the company apparently to pay reparations are donating twenty thousand dollars to a charity of lena Dunham's choice $3,000 is that that's like when when Lena Dunham wakes up in the morning and scratches her face $20,000 falls off that is no money to be donating she's not donating it the company that made the sweatshirt that collaborated with her is doing this the great thing about this like the Sarandon Debra Messing fight it is just this example of the illogic of the left just eating itself the snake eating its own tail just quietly Taylor Swift mmm like oh you know you're not feminist enough you're not woke enough you must speak up on every single issue no that's true anyway so the question is do you guys think that the body positivity movement is helping or hurting women mm-hmm is fat beautiful or an excuse I have I'm very sure desks I feel like I'm kind of not that I'm all over the place on that issue but I feel like I do definitely have a lot of thoughts have you been fed you know what I got I knew I didn't have a kid so I didn't have an excuse for this but you know one time I decided to work out and I just got fat and because that's what happens you eat a lot of food and then you don't want to work out at all and because you're not the rocker Chris because I'm not so I it was like my two weeks of being fat and that I think the real way to think about this is not to think of think less of yourself but to think of yourself less like why are we talking about our bodies at all all of the time why are we so obsessed with our bodies like move on man there's other stuff in the world I think that there's a lot of unhealthy things that have to do with body image especially for young girls but it is a good question so let us know via Facebook YouTube Instagram Twitter we want to know your thoughts do you think that this whole body positivity movement is helpful or hurtful we'll be reading your responses next week when we see you for next week's Friday life's worthy as beautiful I'm Michael Knowles I mean we should cross we'll see ya you
