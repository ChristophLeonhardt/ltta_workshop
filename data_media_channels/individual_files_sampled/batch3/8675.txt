Outback Steakhouse. Aussie Rules. Shannon: HAS PORT FOR THE STATE OF ISRAEL BECOME A PARTISAN ISSUE? IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY. LELAND VITTERT TAKES A LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND ISRAEL. REPUBLICAN SENATORS AT THE OPENING OF THE U.S. EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM COULD BARELY CONTAIN THEIR EXCITEMENT. ALL OF THE THINGS PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD HAVE DONE TO TELL ISRAEL WE HAVE THEIR BACK, MAKING JERUSALEM THE CAPITAL IS THE STRONGEST SIGNAL HE COULD HAVE SENT. THERE WAS NO WAY ON EARTH THAT WE WERE GOING TO OPEN THIS EMBASSY WITHOUT MY BEING HERE TO CELEBRATE IT. YOU COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR IN THE CROWD. TEXAS SENATOR TED CRUZ BLASTED PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR TURNING HIS PARTY AGAINST ISRAEL. WE HAD I THINK TEN HOUSE MEMBERS, NO DEMOCRATS, THAT'S A SAD, SAD MANIFESTATION. IN AND OUT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISRAELI LOBBY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THEN VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE CHOSE A JEWISH RUNNING MATE. 18 YEARS LATER, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. IN A PEW RESEARCH POLL, SELF-DESCRIBED LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SIDE WITH THE PALESTINIANS 35% TO 19% FOR ISRAEL PART OF THE WHOLE PARTY, IT IS 27-25. COMPARE THAT TO A FEW YEARS AGO, 143% OF DEMOCRATS SAID THEY ARE SIMPLY THESE WERE TO THE JEWISH STATE. EVERYTHING IN OUR POLITICS TODAY IS PARTISAN AND POLARIZED. WHEN TRUMP AGREES WITH SOMETHING, DEMOCRATS INTUITIVELY WANT TO DISAGREE EVEN IF IT DOESN'T GO WITH HER PRINCIPLES. CASE IN POINT, THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER VOTED AGAINST IT BACK IN 2015, CITING CAREFUL THOUGHT AND CONSIDERABLE SOUL-SEARCHING. LESS THAN THREE YEARS LATER, SCHUMER LASTED PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WITHDRAWING FROM THE SAME DEAL HE OPPOSED. THERE ARE NO REPORTS THAT IRAN HAS VIOLATED THE AGREEMENT AND TO ME THE GREATEST WORRIES FROM IRAN ARE NOT RIGHT NOW THE NUCLEAR SIDE. FOR DECADES, SUPPORT OF ISRAEL REMAINED ONE OF THE FEW NONPARTISAN ISSUES IN WASHINGTON. NOW THEY SUPPORT IS FAR MORE NUANCED. WITH REPUBLICANS LINING UP BEHIND ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER
