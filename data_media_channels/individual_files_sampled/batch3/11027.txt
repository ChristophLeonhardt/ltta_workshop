hello we're here in st. Petersburg attending the annual st. Petersburg International Economic Forum our topic is from the Atlantic to the Pacific we all know the world is changing we talk about what moves these changes and who's behind them welcome to our panel titled from the Atlantic to the Pacific creating a space for trust trust in 2018 that's an interesting concept here before we discuss our start a discussion I'd like to ask each one of my guests to introduce themselves in their affiliations and tell me I'll go ahead I am Antonio Falco from Italy Bank Contessa Donna p.m. tomorrow I was representing of the French president for Economic Cooperation at the time of President Sarkozy and member of lozad like MD for 15 years and after I am president of my own company in advising Europe and big company we invest and work in Russia excellent prime alexei terentyev chief executive officer of the government Far East and Baikal region Development Fund I'm Klaus Matt gold I have been for 10 years the chairman of the German association for central Eastern Europe and I have different responsibilities in parts of major companies as for example 2e as dumb as well as Rothschild Alexei Pushkov chairman of the information and media commission of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament a present of company Ulsterman in Russia so I stopped producing rolling stock and solutions for the railways and I'm also the vice chairman of the Association European businesses and last but not least and my name is Eddie Corrigan efendim Andina of the faculty were School of International Economics and Foreign Affairs the State University Research University High School of Economics we always have these long descriptions for these panels ok but I think the title of creating a space for trust I mean are we even at a point where we can even contemplate creating trust when we have so much distrust that is just only enhancing as time goes by and it's particularly well one particular country in the world is sowing a lot of distrust all across the globe and we can talk about the Iran deal and other things but I mean you know this was written before that happened but can we actually talk about trust right now we even close to that to my mind Trust is based on a certain balance of interests and until we reach those balance of interests trust will be in jeopardy and that's evident asserting one's interests the interests of one country over the interests of other countries by means of pressure sanctions and so on that that is destroying trust and that's why I understand the essence of your question if we talk about trust today what are we facing I think we are facing and an effort at trust destruction to my mind it comes mostly from one global power and the only global power that has engaged itself on the path of America first which means that the interests of the United States are coming in first place despite any any balance of interests contrary to the necessity of having trust being rebuilt in a world I think you know we mentioning the term interest I mean there's nothing wrong with sovereign countries protecting their national interests its universal but in this day and age we have some that would say your interests are not legitimate basically I think that they are trying to build their relationship I mean in between states on trust it is a failed exercise as well as the failed exercise was to build racial prejudices based on various because valleys are changing within States within societies constantly and you couldn't even find the base the basin you could build a relationship upon common interests and balance of power and that is the only foundation for for whatever you call trust if you understand that your interests coincide I will concur over there moving in the same directions then you could work together and working together you could build up around she wish you called property but if there is no solid foundation then we are doomed to fail that has happened exactly I mean 20 years ago well we were talking trust Trust trust well one side was I mean pushing another side I mean to the fringe job I mean a political extinction now have a backlash if for example a 50 now and due to their backlash you have a one-sided Cold War and according to some of the calculations of me and my colleague we a Russia plus China and others could win in this Cold War will it be good no because the better the bells will be again not stable yes because going into like a new Cold War ice war is not with the choice of all parties here Antonia you want to make a comment might surprise you I would like to focus on free trade we often believe that there are things we are to stay with us forever then we are shackled when we discover the something as disappeared free trade seemed to be eternal but in fact it is a now a vapor attic originally there was to eliminate barriers for goods at the capital flows today we wake up at the discover that global economy is leaning toward the protectionism examples are winding the u.s. introduced global restriction on imports of we still as aluminium while we're gaining for exemptions out of the self-interest we got your point about free trade here and let me go to jump clear because I think it's really important if we look at a greater Eurasian political and economic space obviously trade is going to be involved in that if you think recent events again in Iran is the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the corner is this sending a very strong message now that the Europeans have to start reassess and mean looking towards a mean we it's it's a truism asia's is the center of the future okay because of economic rate because the populations all kinds of things but I mean real political events on the ground now or should make the Europeans start rethinking their position these would be the Atlantic world yeah to make sailing with the previous question and this one you know the trust is a nice thing but it depends we need rules of the game of the rule of the game change we are not in the unilateral world you know Russia is back China is not only the United States but Europe is not bad now these sanctions imposed by the US and the last volley of the sanctions have not to be applicated to European companies and I think historically opportunity is for Europe now and I think that the Italian our Italian partners in Europe are on that way that we have the opportunity to stop when these assumptions everybody forgets that every six months right Europe has to renew the sanctions or not under all unanimity some people you know agree but I mean the Europeans have not shown a lot of strength let's put it that way okay you will go back to 2003 in the illegal invasion of Iraq I mean sure France and Germany were if they didn't back it but in the end they went a long way okay I mean is this a turning point here because I hear this from Europeans all the time but it never changes okay you know what is with my point of view that it's very dangerous for Europe because if we continue like this first we go against our interests which is brought forward companies European companies are he he's brought forward population that is bad for Europe because some countries you know it and his example will go out of this agreement generally in Europe so Europe can explode one day if we not saw this problem I think the president macaw as an historical opportunity you know in the goal east way to stay so to say stop let me go to you because I think it's really interesting I mean if we look at a greater Eurasian political economic and trade space is this a duplication of Western institutions that were put into place after the Second World War I'm thinking of the IMF Bretton Woods these kinds of institutions here there's a there's a interesting literature about the world beyond the West or parallel to the west is this something you would see because there is a hegemon in the West it's the United States but if we look at the Eurasian space would there be a hegemon would it be actually more democratic in a way go ahead first of all I would like to come back to two points I believe sets the question of confidence and trust is something where we should be I believe quite objective and say the world has changed the world has changed and I believe that when we are thinking and coming back to what we have seen as a basis in the world where we had strong confidence between us I believe this has changed dramatically I believe said at the end of the day Europe has to take in a very short timeframe a major decision about for what it stands for is Europe of 27 is a Europe between France Germany Italy Spain and a few others or what what will be the future of Europe may this leads as well so the question question if we can see some parallel ities between what we have achieved and in Europe in our organisations in this world and I believe said said Asia has a huge chance as well to tell where to develop something which is bringing more nations together and up to now and there are very interesting developments not so much about democracy I believe something we should put on the side for a surgery I believe if you are looking to state as Kazakhstan Uzbekistan see some countries who are developing in a certain sense and we have a parliament but they are coming from a long term history which doesn't allow to think and to work in categories of democratic countries and I believe said whose biggest and with a strong tradition in manufacturing could be a very good complementarity for both of the countries and so lets them keep some time help subsidies monies with EBRD to develop these economies and I believe this will be well invested money we go to election because I mean it's interesting you're talking about us Beca site in Kazakhstan I mean cause it sounds a very interesting story and very interesting model but when we think of the Eurasia space everyone more or less thanks to what degree and I go to Alexa here this China lead Oh Chuck China does indeed pretend now to be leading since they famous speech by CE Jinping in Davos where he filled the vacuum left by the superpower on the other side of the Atlantic but I would like to quickly come back to your question of trust and bring up one fact as an investor and part of the group of my profession where people having our own crystal balls looking into the future having our models analyzing corporations companies how to preserve wealth and purchasing power for decades ahead investors do not nearly feel the same crisis do not display any gloom if you look at financial markets bond yields are very low equity valuations are very high so investors are happy companies are investing at record levels banks who recently we're sort of written off as non-existent profession are turning out 10% return on equity on trillions of assets so financial markets are doing well so I frankly think that a lot of this trust crisis is more of a political phenomena where politicians use rhetoric addressing the domestic audiences using the the weapon of sanctions is more than rhetoric see I agree it's very serious and it's a form of warfare that I think if people underestimate a lot okay I mean when you think how many countries in the world are under sanctioned by the United States it's extraordinary it's extraordinary I'm Peter LaBelle I'm host of Artie's political discussion program crosstalk and we have a a very interesting panel here to discuss this issue of trust let me go to Theni period I'm a businessman so I will give a more business point of view it's clear there is no business without trust forest which is important in this there is unions there is you news of the Eurasian Economic resin economic union for us we want more integration bid European businessman more integral in my visits to unions why and why I love him is that by China I will tell you is very fit the 70% in in Russia 70% and so quite more or less in the region you can make un 70% of the free indirect investment group s that's all 10% American and the rest and China is in terms of investment it's not because we produce easy means that the European companies produce air produce inertia produce in Kazakhstan produce in the union that we have company we manage these companies these companies are against of course Russian origin economic union law but we manage them and we have no problem we have captured trace of the Russian authorities of the commission of the Eurasian Economic Union and so on so we are here and you never read that in the New York Times here let me go to the front row here this completely open it up to everyone here thank you Peter but the discussion so far seems to see has avoided the theme from Atlantic to Pacific I just want to reach that point yeah I want to pick up on this idea of a parallel world of business and transactions and I think that's a very valid idea things have become different from the Cold War times we we don't have a classic Cold War we have a confrontation between at the top level between the governments and still a lot of context a lot of interaction lot of meetings and so on between the societies and that's a qualitatively new feature and it also applies to business because we have a cold war or an appearance of a cold war but the business still still do well there is the issue of sanctions which is extremely important and which actually spoils a bit this picture of a parallel world which is independent of politics I've been speaking to quite a few people in in the European Union at the very top level and I say are you against sanctions yes we are very much against sanctions so please say that the Council of the of the European Union say well maybe if the Italians do that we will support them when I talk to the Italians they say well if the Spanish do that we will support them I say I come to Athens and I say look but tell it please you know against the sanctions against Russia yeah but tell your Greece you can afford the Orthodox unity but that's individuals but it's a group they can't say no and so miracle when she decides what to do in order to keep the unity of the European Union wonderful renew the sanctions every six months without discussing in this issue because it will be yet another issue of discord in the European Union but the problem is that you know we have something which your key point we didn't speak about it you say that the people are if you speak with the top political level guys you are right and if you speak totally right it but some people say what I say I belong to them but you know for the business community is a top CEO of the big group what happens if they are subsidiary in the United States they are like this they cannot sign nothing but because they are blocked and when they are they not even can go again to to new New York or Washington the United States and the compliance system block them and the legal the legal opinion who does a legal opinion however confront what why does this is your miss block so we have to stop the extract reality observe of the law of us in Europe and and of the counterparty if not you are blocked that's no way to treat allies and friends unfortunately in order to lift sanctions you need more than one country this rule of the Union yeah but I want to return back to the Atlantic to the Pacific we have we all from Europe here and this general we have to understand the room Italy failed 25 years ago when we had an opportunity to build a common space but one of the reasons why we failed was because we didn't have a common common goal and now Russia and other countries are proposing as a new common goal we're building a greater Eurasian space including Japan including eventually Indonesia we are having a new opportunity we have to think differently and maybe if we go in that direction together we will rebuild the foundation for trust and not building it of course against Chinese because I've been recently to Germany I mean we all remember I mean when some of our German friends I mean let's unite against China aha no way I mean it's let's unite with China two points the first point is about what you have saying many people in Europe have today a feeling what you were just mentioning said Russia is moving east and less committed to Europe Western European orientations which would be I believe a shift of paradigm yes and it could be a development which still will be a new a new wake of distinction between Western Europe see EU and Russia and I believe said we must be very careful if we say that we have a common history that we have common values between Russia and Western Europe no takis are much about see you but about Western Europe especially I believe says this should be a point which triggers again sense a question of trust and of confidence and you know it's it's for us especially it's coming from our own point of view we have so much common links between Russia and Germany history literature she's terrible war be grateful for what you have done for our unification and whatever so we believe said we would not like to give this up we would like to be close to Russia if I remember Klauss statement here on the same subject at five years ago he would have said oh no Russia is a completely European and she should even go east or think is now you're already ambivalent about that whether I mean Klaus in five years and then we were you will say that let's go together far-reaching extremely strategic know one of the few Germans I know say again okay we know each other now since more than twenty five years and I believe really said what I wanted to say is that we want we must have in Europe together with Russia a very clear strategic orientation where to go and I believe this is even more important after the Iran decision of the United something I believe where we have to work and where should we should have as well a new basis of confidence and we should we should bring out since doubts which we have actually about the strategy of Russia very important whether Europe will pass the test of Iran because everybody says let's keep the deal now Merkel has agreed that European companies will leave Iran mostly and the European Union will not compensate to Iran the losses you know if if Europe is dragged into the US sanctions against Iran against its own will then the test will not be passed I would say to my German friend know we can ask to our German friends we went to the shoe if you go if you want to go more east and west we do everything to push them in the arms of China and we are lucky that they are not completely this kind of China because they try their best for me I will say it's very easy you know if the biggest market is the world so for a company is very I mean Iran as I mean the u.s. is very sanctioned well when I close I prefer to preserve I prefer to close us of course not us but you see after whether your interest if you're more trade more investment in Iran but usually you have more in the u.s. so it's very easy let's go to the front row here well I think so far you know by hearing this very lively discussion and debate I just want to make the following point first of all I think there are China Russia economically are quite complimentary China has a surplus of capacity in building infrastructure maybe we're overdoing that in China but China is good at doing that ideology aside I think China sees that at the precondition for economic development secondly China is taking the environment protection now extremely seriously again because we have overlooked that for so many years we are paying the price so Russia has competitive advantage on that front I think Central Asia is extremely important I don't want to be emphasized that but I think Central Asia itself won't move the needle when you look at Pacific when you look at Europe so economically I do see the rationale for China Russia and Germany now to form alliance but to create more synergy economically this is a Chinese leaders perspective precisely because this two French gentlemen have been arguing against each other Chinese leaders I think they only take Germany seriously in Europe I hate to say this I believe released Germany has a strong interest a very strong interest and say it again due to tradition due to history due to a lot of common links said we should come back to a leadership role in Europe to bring Russia back in in a Western orientation we have no interest at all said Russia is moving east this is not now is not about shoes that is you have to choose we had to make that decision you can't but Peter says see life is not black and white I believe we know I think there's a man in the White House yes Patrick white certainly but I believe that we have to to make sure that we are doing as well a lot of efforts as Europeans especially seen since United States development said we are doing everything to bring the sanctions down and say a knows my opinion about ever customary don't you think the litmus test is going to be your energy policy because you know what Europe's energy policies being made in Washington DC right now yes to make validation as well this is not black and white you will see said we will find a solution for not stream to in the next couple of weeks and knowing such Americans know here guys here and knowing such Americans will not like it and said I will certainly look for us a ways and means to bring discipline back between the United States and Germany and to you so I believe since we says what we have to be aware of but but I'm sure that we have as well as Germans very strongly looking to the United States said we seize it say something changing if it comes to say overall let me say excellent relationship which we always had between Germany Europe and the United States Iran is a critical point a very critical point and see issue said the United States were taking the addition a decision against not without but again a European a very clear orientation will be as we some harm for the next foreseeable future alright we've run out of time I hope you've enjoyed our panel here from the Atlantic to the Pacific creating a space for trust here at the same Petersburg International Economic Forum thank you for being
