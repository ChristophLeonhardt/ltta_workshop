let's get to the White House Correspondents Dinner because everybody's freaking out over Michelle Wolf's set so let's watch the set and then we're gonna address the criticism ready here we go it's kind of be fun cuz she's funny every time Sarah steps up to the podium I get excited because I'm not really sure what we're gonna get you know a press briefing a bunch of Lies or divided into softball teams it shirts and skins and this time don't be such a little bitch Jim Acosta now that's funny because she had a big runnin with Jim Acosta and she runs that press room like a softball coach now at first I thought maybe that's the joke they're upset about because she's saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders looks like a softball coach which is stereotyping and but no it really has to do with the Jim Acosta and the way she runs the room that's what that was about so you have to give her the benefit of the doubt there there isn't really any doubt she was making fun of her demeanor in the run-in with Jim Acosta so so now there's two for two she's ok here we go I actually really like Sarah I think she's very resourceful like she burns facts and then she uses that Ash to create a perfect smoky eye like maybe she's born with it maybe it's lies it's probably life so that's the joke that everyone is pretending was about her appearance she said she burns facts and uses the ashes to create a perfect smoky eye meaning she has pretty eyes and where does she get the make up for it when she burns facts now Steph has a theory about why people are upset about that joke what's your theory stuff I think they think she said burns fat and I think that's where they're all misguided because they keep saying oh are you gonna how can you support Michelle with these kind of comments that are targeting Sandra unfairly she said burn facts yeah backs facts not fact so I think when a lot of people thought that she said burn fat and then they realized she did it and then they still wouldn't back down because they're they're reporters for establishment newspapers and they don't have any integrity so here we go so that's the big joke that's it does a guy's smoky eye that's the big controversy that's the guy said that's it burns fag and uses the ashes to create a perfect smoky eye Wow and I'm not really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders you know is it Sarah Sanders is it Sarah Huckabee Sanders is it cousin Huckabee is it anti Huckabee Sanders like what's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women Oh Coulter Uncle Tom name for a white woman unless another I think would have been funnier head she said I know Hillary Clinton that would have been funnier cuz then she's being bipartisan bashing in a little bit funnier to you but for a lot of people that would be confusing they wouldn't get the right ear right okay that's the only one miners in your problem she's probably right to do it though her waiter I'm probably wrong can I just do my Sarah Huckabee Sanders impression right now for you yes yes very good thank you that's very good work I've been working on it so here's the bullshit criticism of that so now you saw basically the whole thing Maggie Haberman that press secretary sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance that's what Maggie hate by I don't know if you know anything about Maggie Haberman she's not the best alright she's often wildly off base and borderline crazy right I'll say that Boise borderline I would agree what did an awful example of reporting yes that's by right right there that's a bad reporting right there that's how off-base she is and when it's so she's criticizing a comedian so imagine what this is this is one of the most powerful people in media Maggie Haberman who has access because she works for the New York Times because of frickin nepotism not because she's got talent or skill because she was born an insider cuz here's come on and Johnny now you know who he is he's a comedian from the big SiC right he wrote that and starred in it he says to her please quote the exact line that intensely criticized her appearance you're a journalist you should be doing this already Maggie writes back that isn't what I said um yes it is there it is satin absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance he asked you to quote it you lied that's called lying guess that's called you being revealed as a phony fuckin liar with zero integrity and no character that's who make that's who the writers are at the New York Times all the good writers they fired Chris Hedges got fired you know why because he wouldn't stop telling the truth about the Iraq war so they got rid of them that's what happens to writers who tell the truth at the New York Times and guess what happens to writers who don't they get promoted like Maggie Haberman an access journalist uh without compare shouldn't that kind of response like if we were having an argument yes and you said I didn't say that yes you're a crazy maker you're at that she's not only is she a bad reporter she's she's now literally a crazy maker so if you know what a crazy maker is there are people who make you think you're crazy when you see reality for what it is they go why you good that's called gaslighting it's another that's another term that's what mag that's what report ital showed you how that reporter for the Washington Post did that to a regular person who asked him about Jeff Bezos being in bed with the CIA that reporter for The Washington Post gaslighted that guy here's another reporter for the New York Times gas lighting a comedian in public the problem is we all see it but the bigger problem is she works for the New York time and she's lying at the behest of the establishment so they will never be a penalty to pay just like Brian Williams just like Joanne Reid just like all of them who lie to us and do a will illegal war there's never a price to pay then come on then Johnny comes back with I asked Maggie at New York Times to quote the line where Michelle intensely criticized Sarah Huckabee Sanders appearance she unfollowed me she has an extremely important job making vague statements that she herself cannot back up with facts and quotes isn't helping that's a comedian who has more character integrity and journalistic responsibility than head reporter for The New York Times and now you know why we're in Libya Iraq Afghanistan Syria and why the country's poor and broke because we have reporters like Maggie Haberman who aren't worth a shit well and also she has completely proven Michaele Wolf's point yes right because she is Maggie Haberman in this instance I don't know what she's done otherwise good or bad but in this instance she is protecting the powerful the powerful she's protecting Trump and and and Trump's regime or Trump's administration of which Sanders is a big part of she's a spokesperson for it yeah so she's protecting the Trump entity and then you know just the from actual scrutiny yes for actual scrutiny and and that's Michelle will point it out they're gonna profit off of this outrage it's manufactured outrage they manufactured the monster dimension manufacture of the situation manufacture the outrage then they profit off of it so yes so she's doing exactly what he's calling her a whore and what the two comedians are calling the press out for this is manifest that she's doing it here it is if you enjoyed this clip of aggressive progressives you know there's a 90-minute show waiting for you at the Young Turks Network go to tea white
