young turks now has audio the TYT audio network podcast of some of your favorite shows and new shows including one with Nina Turner former Ohio State Senator she's gonna do we the people with Nina Turner talking about equality and justice and seeing that through the eyes of regular Americans who are affected by politics and policy everybody check it out at TYT dot-com / audio Iran has just announced that it plans to begin its uranium enrichment program at a particular plant that it had previously agreed to close down in the Iran nuclear deal but there might be a silver lining in this story so just stay with me for a second according to reports Iran will begin uranium enrichment at its Fordo plant and will install new nuclear equipment at the Natanz facility if it withdraws if it withdraws from a nuclear deal with major powers now clearly the United States has already withdrawn from that nuclear deal that was a huge story a few weeks ago however the other international players who have signed on to that deal are fighting pretty aggressively to keep the deal intact those countries include Russia China Germany Britain and France now according to a spokesperson with the Atomic Energy organization of Iran currently the supreme leader the Ayatollah Ali Khomeini has ordered that the programs be carried out within the parameters of the nuclear deal so so far even though they're announcing that they're gonna be enriching their uranium they're gonna be doing it in the confines of this deal what they're trying to message here is we don't like what Trump did there is a possibility that this entire deal will fall apart as a result of what Trump did however there's a possibility that will maintain this this deal as long as the other powers that are involved work with us so let's give you another statement and when he meaning the meaning the Ayatollah when he gives the order we will announce the programs for operating outside of the nuclear deal and reviewing this this plant or reviving this particular plantain also president Hassan Rowhani expressed delight with the stance adopted so far by European countries including France to preserve this joint comprehensive plan of action so look there's still hope for this nuclear deal and and you know maybe I'm being naive and feeling a little bit of this hope but there are other countries that are fighting pretty aggressively to maintain it and and that's good news yeah yeah it's a it's a good consequence of the fact that this was a meticulously negotiated multilateral agreement over the course of a decade with all of those countries and that that's one thing that we have going for us of course we do have to acknowledge that in yet another area we have withdrawn our influence our ability to try to in some cases make the world a better place thankfully the countries that are stepping up into roles of leadership in the world will be able to do that and yeah I just I hope for in terms of regional security and all that that Iran does stay within the deal it seems unlikely considering the sanctions that we're going to reimpose on them and even inside of the deal by the way so they talked about resuming enrichment you can enrich uranium just not up to a certain level I think it's something like three point six nine percent or something like that so they can do it within those confines it's just once they tried to produce highly enriched uranium that would be weapons-grade that become becomes a gigantic problem and obviously violates the deal but but with the prospect of that possibility on the horizon it is amazing that Donald Trump in perhaps amongst all of your well Ian's things that he has done there has been nothing more oh well Yin then we are going to pull out of the Iran nuclear Accords to stop them from having nuclear weapons it is something that almost directly obviously will lead us down a path where they end up with nukes that is the obvious result of it if you have looked into what the Iran nuclear Accords actually produced which is cutting out far more than 90% of all the highly enriched uranium that they have cutting out almost all of their centrifuges especially the the newer ones that are capable of producing weapons-grade uranium the idea that that shredding that produces a less weapons capable Iran makes no sense to anyone who knows anything about nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon development also this whole story just really points the cognitive dissonance of those who support Trump and his efforts in North Korea yet think that the Iran nuclear deal was a terrible one as you guys know the Iran nuclear deal was very specific it had a very specific timetable it had very specific verification and it it essentially gave the United States and all these other world leaders what they wanted now there was no discussion about dismantling their missiles programs that was not part of the discussion that's something that was brought up by by Trump and the naysayers later this was all about ensuring that Iran didn't create a nuclear weapon that was the whole point and then all of a sudden oh well you know what we want them to also stop building these weapons and we want them to stop funding these you know terrorist organizations throughout the world those are lofty goals and I understand the reasoning behind it but for the purposes of nuclear war and and preventing the development of nuclear weapons this was a great deal and it was certainly much more specific and detailed than the agreement or statement that was signed by Trump and kim jeong-hoon now I hope that further negotiations with Kim jong-un will lead to more detailed a more detailed agreement but I just people want to applaud Trump for what he just did with North Korea while also applauding him for doing something that could potentially lead to nuclear development in Iran yeah when if we are lucky after many meetings and probably years of diplomacy between the u.s. and North Korea if we are lucky what we will get is something like the Iran nuclear codes but for North Korea right if we're lucky we will have officials from the Atomic Energy Agency going around and looking at their facilities and mapping out all their capabilities and and verifying it even the Trump administration going throughout Iran and verifying that they are in compliance with the deal if we are lucky we will end up with that same thing in North Korea and at that point Sean Hannity will applaud while of course having attacked the Iran version of it this entire time yeah we live in a ridiculous world where nothing is true and nothing matters yeah I feel that stress everyday things that are true that's that's how an insular world works so you have one president who by the way it's also not talked about how there was multiple countries involved with the Iran deal if you just talk to any random American was listening to what the president says you would think this is in America and Iran deal and Obama came and just put into place and gave away the house to no one talks about these other countries were involved first of all but then where is the one one thing that happened a couple days Gord they dare to go with Kim Jong hoon was just two guys talking and then suddenly none of the details are there but he can say um we'll have people in there trust me or it'll come together trust me and those that lack of details you believe the one strong man who's saying all that and also believe him is saying it that the deal that had details to it had nothing to it it's just you you'd avoid yourself of all fact and follow just with what the guy says it's the power of messaging and Trump has really mastered that skill I mean he lies and his lies though they don't even go unchecked I mean you will have fact-checkers proving that what he's saying is just an outright lie and somehow his messaging is so powerful that it will overcome that fact check he tweeted that 500 days ago we were at the brink of war with North Korea were we do you remember that 500 days ago what like were we about to go to war with North Korea no the only time that there has been actual like fear that something could develop was in response to his tweets against North Korea which was up five hundred days ago it was during his first year of the presidency and it's amazing it's yeah five hundred days ago or five hundred days ago we were ready to go to war with Eastasia we were always ready to go to war with Eastasia and and eurasia and we just we whatever the facts need to be for his current thing please read or well it'll help you understand Donald Trump's administration much better yeah it doesn't matter to his followers one bit that there is no truth to it yeah well you know his strategy is to set expectations low yeah because that's essentially what happened you you scare everyone with potential nuclear war with North Korea and the second he does something a little diplomatic everyone's like everyone by the way across the political spectrums like give him a cookie but again I I will give him the cookie I give him cookie for a diplomatic approach but you've got to hold his feet to the fire and ensure that he does what's necessary to denuclearize North Korea two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button
