00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,272

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,175
HIGHER BY ENERGY SHARES.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:13,346
RECORD HIGHS ACROSS U.S. STOCKS,

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,048
BUT IS THIS STILL A HEATED BULL

6
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,849
RALLY?

7
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:17,650
WE WILL GIVE YOU THE EVIDENCE

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:23,556
AND LET U.S. -- LET YOU DECIDE.

9
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,290
JOE: PLUS, A NEW KIND OF

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,126
GLOBALIZATION.

11
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,228
MARK: AND WE WILL LOOK AT THE

12
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,963
RESULTS FOR WALMART MEAN FOR

13
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,500
RETAIL.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,267
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH OUR

15
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:39,538
MARKET MINUTE.

16
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:41,174
OIL AND HEARD A BULL MARKET.

17
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,475
IF YOU LOOK AT EQUITIES.

18
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:43,243
IT WAS KIND OF MEANDERING FOR

19
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:47,347
MUCH OF THE DAY.

20
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,816
JOE: MEANDERING IS RIGHT, BUT I

21
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,785
WOULD SAY IT'S A CONTINUATION OF

22
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:52,552
WHAT WE SAW DURING THE FED

23
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,156
MEETINGS YESTERDAY.

24
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:57,824
ESSENTIALLY, IT WAS A

25
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:02,561
SLOW-MOTION CONTINUATION.

26
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,063
MARK: I THINK MEANDER IS A GOOD

27
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,465
WORD FOR STOCKS.

28
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,133
I WANT TO START WITH A GROUP

29
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,402
THAT LED THE MARKET HIGHER.

30
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,205
WE TALKED ABOUT OIL GETTING INTO

31
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:12,772
A BULL MARKET.

32
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,507
HERE WE GO.

33
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,643
THE ENERGY INDEX HAS BEEN A

34
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,544
PRETTY BIG PART OF THE RALLY.

35
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:21,447
YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH IT GAINED

36
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:21,814
TODAY.

37
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:24,484
IT WAS UP 60 BASIS POINTS AT ONE

38
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,753
POINT.

39
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,856
LEADING THE MARKET HIGHER, NOT

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,424
AS MUCH WEIGHT ON THE S&P AS IT

41
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,693
USED A HAVE, BUT STILL AN

42
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,127
IMPACT.

43
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:34,727
WE HAVE UTILITIES AND

44
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,131
FINANCIALS.

45
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,633
THESE ARE THE TWO THAT MAKE

46
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,234
HEADLINES EVERY DAY.

47
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,904
IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE MARKET

48
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,738
FEELS ABOUT INTEREST RATES RIGHT

49
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,039
NOW.

50
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,940
RIGHT NOW, WORK EXPECTATIONS

51
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,908
HAVE GONE DOWN.

52
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,145
FINANCIALS STILL HANGING IN

53
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:52,545
THERE.

54
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,680
I HAVE TWO COUP KIND OF FUN

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,781
STOCKS THAT POPPED UP TODAY.

56
00:01:54,781 --> 00:02:00,520
PRIVATE PRISON STOCKS -- WE GOT

57
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,855
NEWS TODAY THAT PRIVATE PRISONS

58
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,290
WILL SHORTLY BE NO MORE OR AT

59
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,091
LEAST CEASED TO EXIST IN THE WAY

60
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,026
THEY DO NOW.

61
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,363
OBVIOUSLY, THE PRICE OF PRIVATE

62
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:10,963
PRISONS GOT CRUSHED.

63
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:16,569
JOE: PRETTY QUIET DAY ON THE

64
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,270
GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET,

65
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,973
CONTINUING YESTERDAY'S TRENDS.

66
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,076
LOWER TWO-YEAR AND 10 YEAR

67
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,944
YIELDS AS EXPECTATIONS OF SAID

68
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:25,611
POLICY CONTINUE TO EASE.

69
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:30,350
SCARLET: CONTINUE TO EASE, AND

70
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,150
THE DOLLAR DECLINED AS WELL.

71
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,654
THE POUND WAS A BIG JUMPER AS

72
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,357
HARD DATA OUT OF THE U.K. SHOWED

73
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,892
ONCE AGAIN THE ECONOMY HOLDING

74
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,692
UP BETTER THAN EXPECTED AFTER

75
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,028
THE BREXIT VOTE.

76
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:46,065
SO FAR, IF YOU TALLIED UP,

77
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,401
INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS,

78
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,235
AND RETAIL SALES HAVE ALL DONE

79
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:53,439
BETTER THAN FEARED.

80
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,108
THE YEN IS CURRENTLY BELOW 100.

81
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,210
YOU CAN SEE THE HEAD AND

82
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,445
SHOULDER PATTERN OUT THERE.

83
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,146
THE NECKLINE THERE, AND

84
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:06,719
ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG'S FX

85
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,225
STRATEGIST, THE NEXT CURRENCY TO

86
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,025
WATCH IS DOLLAR-YEN.

87
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:18,131
JOE: BOYLE IS UP 30% ON THE AIR.

88
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,166
IT FELT LIKE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO

89
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,802
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OIL

90
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,336
BEAR MARKET.

91
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,937
NOW, IT IS BACK IN A BULL

92
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,807
MARKET, UP 22% FROM ITS LOWS AT

93
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,209
THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH.

94
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,278
IT IS AMAZING TO ME HOW FAST THE

95
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,347
STORY CHANGES.

96
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,015
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, WE WERE

97
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,752
LIKE, THERE IS ALL THIS SUPPLY,

98
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,520
INVENTORY, SPILLING OUT OF THE

99
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,887
TANKS.

100
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,725
SCARLET: WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED

101
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,325
EARLIER THIS YEAR ON

102
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:46,793
SPECULATION.

103
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,494
MARK: IT'S A PRETTY BIG MOVE ON

104
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:48,895
HOPE.

105
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,965
SCARLET: YOU JUST NEED PEOPLE TO

106
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:53,633
BELIEVE IN IT.

107
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,400
THAT IS YOUR MARKET MINUTE.

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,203
LET'S TAKE A DEEP TIES INTO THE

00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,539
BLOOMBERG.

110
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,007
YOU CAN FOLLOW THE FUNCTIONS AT

111
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,142
THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

112
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,510
TRY LOOKING INTO THE RETAIL

113
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:04,911
RUMBLE.

114
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,548
TARGET SALES DISAPPOINTED IN THE

115
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,382
COMPANY SAID U.S. SHOPPERS ARE

116
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,517
CAUTIOUS.

117
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,052
MEANWHILE, WALMART SAID

118
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,054
CONSUMERS ARE OK.

119
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,822
WALMART SHARES HAVE OUTPERFORMED

120
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,557
TARGET, AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN

121
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:21,627
THE RELATIVE SHARE VALUATION.

122
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:29,335
WHEN THE LINE GOES UP, SHARES

123
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:29,902
ARE INCREASING.

124
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:30,803
RIGHT NOW, WALMART'S SHARES ARE

125
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,639
AT A 20% PREMIUM TO TARGET

126
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,876
SHARES.

127
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:41,514
>> EACH HAS ITS OWN ISSUES.

128
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:47,186
SCARLET: LISTEN CAREFULLY WHEN

129
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:47,920
SOMEONE SAYS CONSUMERS ARE

130
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,321
CAUTIOUS.

131
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,856
MARK: TARGET IS STILL TRADING

132
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,356
BELOW AVERAGE.

133
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,424
SCARLET: GOOD POINT.

134
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:56,829
JOE: I AM LOOKING AT INITIAL

135
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,563
JOBLESS CLAIMS AS I DO EVERY

136
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,966
THURSDAY.

137
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,767
THEY KEEP IMPROVING.

138
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,370
THE WHITE LINE IS NOT JUST

139
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,838
SEASONALLY ADJUSTED CLAIMS.

140
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,606
THE DOTTED LINE IS THE MOVING

141
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,808
AVERAGE.

142
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,843
MOVING OUT TO GET A BROAD TREND.

143
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,446
ANOTHER POST CRISIS LOW ON THIS

144
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:13,880
MEASURE.

145
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,147
WE JUST DON'T SEE ANY SIGNS OF

146
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:15,815
LABOR MARKET WEAKNESS.

147
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:21,387
SCARLET: IS IT GOING TO BE A

148
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,222
BIGGER DEAL WHEN THE LINE STARTS

149
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,023
TO MOVE UP OR WHEN IT STARTS

150
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:24,423
FALLING?

151
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:27,760
JOE: IT TICKS UP FROM TIME TO

152
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,864
TIME, BUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT

153
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,532
IS CONSISTENT IS PRETTY

154
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:32,965
ASTOUNDING.

155
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,035
MARK: IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD'S

156
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:36,769
MOST BORING ROLLER COASTER.

157
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,837
JOE: GOOD ONE.

00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,608
MARK: I AM GOING TO LOOK AT A

159
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,709
CHART THAT LOST, BUT I AM GOING

160
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:49,482
TO DOUBLE DOWN, RMB ON THE US --

161
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,583
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON THE

162
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,017
S&P 500.

163
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,585
I AM LOOKING AT THIS WITH THE

164
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,953
HELP OF MY COLLEAGUE, KEVIN

165
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,056
KELLY.

166
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,760
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

167
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,627
COMPANIES AREN'T SPENDING AS

168
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,428
MUCH AS THEIR PROFIT MARGINS ARE

169
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,330
FALLING.

170
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,233
WE ARE BASICALLY SHOWING PROFIT

171
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,167
MARGINS GETTING THINNER AND

172
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,369
THINNER.

173
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,236
THIS IS A NORMALIZED CHART BACK

174
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,438
TO 2014.

175
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,272
PROFIT MARGINS HAVE SHRUNK BACK

176
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,142
TO 14%.

177
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,078
ONE THING HAS EXPANDED QUITE A

178
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:19,812
BIT, AND THAT IS RESEARCH AND

179
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,180
DEVELOPMENT.

180
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,818
THIS SHOWS UP ON YOUR BALANCE

181
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:26,552
SHEET AND WILL EAT AWAY THAT

182
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,488
PROFIT MARGIN.

183
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,256
MAYBE COMPANIES WILL BE

184
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,859
REASSURED THAT THEY ARE SPENDING

185
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,394
A GOOD BIT ON RESEARCH AND

186
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:35,861

THANK YOU.

WE ARE HAVING A BIT OF A RALLY

191
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,207
HERE, NOT HUGE.

192
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,309
WHAT DID YOU LEARN YESTERDAY

193
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,280
FROM THE FED AND WHAT IS THE

194
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,281
CORRECT INTERPRETATION?

195
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,151
>> THE FED IS IN NO PARTICULAR

196
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:04,490
URGENT MOOD TO START RAISING

197
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,924
RATES.

198
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,892
THEY DO SEEM INCLINED THAT THEY

199
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,362
WOULD LIKE TO GET A RATE HIKE IN

200
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,465
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

201
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,767
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MINUTES

202
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,568
THAT SUGGESTED IT WOULD HAPPEN

203
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,069
AS EARLY US UP AMBER.

204
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,674
THERE IS STILL A WIDE RANGE --

205
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,241
AS SEPTEMBER.

206
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,576
THERE IS STILL A WIDE RANGE OF

207
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,243
INTERPRETATION ABOUT THE

208
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,511
ECONOMY.

209
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,380
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE

210
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,716
OUT WHAT, IF ANYTHING, BRAGS IT

211
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,317
MEANS FOR THE U.S. 

212
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:38,257
AND THEY ARE STILL SMARTING FROM

213
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,058
THE SPRING, WHEN THEY THOUGHT

214
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,195
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE

215
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:42,962
RATES, AND THEN DEVELOPMENT

216
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:49,868
PREVENTED THEM FROM DOING SO.

217
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,904
THE RISKS OF BEING LATE ARE NOT

218
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:55,775
AS BAD AS THE RISKS OF BEING

219
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,142
EARLY.

220
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:04,851
THAT IS THEIR AMMO -- M.O.

221
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:10,323
SCARLET: HE SAYS THE NEW NORMAL

222
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,090
MEANS ONLY 80,000 JOB GAINS

223
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,892
NEEDED PER MONTH.

224
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:17,897
WHAT DOES THE MORE HAWKISH FED

225
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:22,101
SPEAK ON THE HEELS OF DOVISH

226
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,036
MINUTES THREE WEEKS AGO TELL YOU

227
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,639
ABOUT THE FED'S CONFIDENCE IN

228
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,173
THEIR MODELS?

229
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,607
>> I THINK WHAT THE FED IS

230
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,544
TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW IS WALK A

231
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,945
FINE LINE BETWEEN BEING

232
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,014
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY --

233
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,049
BECAUSE WHEN THE CENTRAL BANK IS

234
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,951
OPTIMISTIC, IT'S EASIER FOR

235
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:39,952
PEOPLE IN THE MARKET TO BE

236
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,655
OPTIMISTIC, BUT AT THE SAME

237
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,856
TIME, STILL VERY CAUTIOUS,

238
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,157
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT 2-D

239
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,026
RAIL WHAT THEY HAVE ENGENDERED

240
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:52,098
HERE, WHICH IS A RECOVERY THAT

241
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:52,898
HAS LASTED QUITE A LONG TIME.

242
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:55,901
KEEP IN MIND, WE HAVE JACKSON

243
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,037
HOLE COMING UP, AND IT SEEMS

244
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,672
LIKE THE MESSAGE FROM JACKSON

245
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,506
HOLE IS GOING TO BE THAT THE FED

246
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:05,311
WANTS TO RESET THE FRAMEWORK IT

247
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,548
USES FOR IMPLEMENTING MONETARY

248
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:09,949
POLICY.

249
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:10,816
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON IT'S A

250
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,352
LITTLE DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER

251
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,153
WHAT THE MESSAGE IS BECAUSE IT

252
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,456
SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE CHANGING

253
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,291
THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD AND

254
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,127
CONSEQUENTLY HOW THEY WANT TO

255
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,461
AFFECT THE WORLD.

256
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:28,067
MARK: WE ARE LOOKING AT A FEW

257
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,903
METRICS HERE THAT THE FED

258
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,570
CONSIDERS INFLATION.

259
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,773
AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS.

260
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,573
EVERYTHING IS TRENDING UPWARD

261
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,442
OVER THE PAST YEAR, GETTING

262
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,577
CLOSER TO WHERE THE FED WANTS TO

263
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:43,048
BE AS WELL AS JOBLESS CLAIMS

264
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:44,283
STABILIZING AT A LOWER LEVEL.

265
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,987
IF YOU LOOK AT NOW VERSUS LAST

266
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:48,821
YEAR, THE PROBABILITY OF A HIKE

267
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:54,527
WAS SO MUCH HIGHER.

268
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,761
IS THERE SOMETHING WE ARE

269
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,632
MISSING?

270
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,634
>> I THINK THE MARKET HAS BEEN

271
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,104
LEARNING FROM FED BEHAVIOR.

272
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,974
THE FED TOLD US THEY WOULD RAISE

273
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:08,874
RATES FASTER AND MORE OFTEN THAN

274
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,845
HAS ACTUALLY OCCURRED.

275
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:21,053
MARKETS TEND TO LEARN BY DOING.

276
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:21,887
SAID FUNDS FUTURES CONTINUED TO

277
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,356
PRICE IN A RATE HIKE THROUGH THE

278
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:27,693
END OF 2017, WHICH IN THE VIEW

279
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,360
OF BUILD DUDLEY IS BEING

280
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,728
SOMEWHAT COMPLACENT, BUT ON THE

281
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:34,066
OTHER HAND, JAMES CAME OUT AND

282
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:34,867
SAID HE THINKS THE FED SHOULD

283
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,003
ONLY RAISE RATES ONCE OVER THE

284
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,371
NEXT TWO YEARS, WHICH IS

285
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,205
BASICALLY TELLING THE MARKETS

286
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:39,805
THEY HAVE IT RIGHT.

287
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,408
UNTIL THEY COME UP WITH A

288
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,943
UNIFIED MESSAGE, I THINK THE

289
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,911
MARKETS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

290
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,948
TRADE OFF PAST BEHAVIOR, WHICH

291
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,217
MEANS THE FED WILL IMPLEMENT

292
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,518
HIGHER RATES SLOWER THAN THEY

293
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,319
SAID THEY WILL END LATER THAN

294
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:53,953
THEY SAID THEY WILL.

295
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:59,592
SCARLET: OF COURSE, THERE IS A

296
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,594
LOT OF SKEPTICISM OUT THERE

297
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,362
ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE MONETARY

298
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,163
POLICY IS IN THE U.S. AND AROUND

299
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,364
THE WORLD.

300
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,334
HERE IS WHAT PAUL KRUGMAN TOLD

301
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,201
US.

302
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,603
>> THERE'S AN ACCUMULATION OF

303
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,137
EVIDENCE THAT MONETARY POLICY IS

304
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,073
PRETTY INEFFECTIVE.

305
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,875
FOR A WHILE, WE CAME INTO THIS

306
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,778
THINKING 0% RATES WERE

307
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:20,279
INEFFECTIVE.

308
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,680
THEN CAME QE.

309
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,149
THEN CAME NEGATIVE RATES.

310
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,884
IT TURNS OUT THERE WERE ALWAYS

311
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,985
THINGS THE CENTRAL BANK COULD

312
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,253
DO, BUT THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY

313
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:27,720
DOING MUCH.

314
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,790
MARK: PAUL KRUGMAN SAYS MONETARY

315
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,726
POLICY IS NOT DOING THAT MUCH.

316
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,593
YOU HAD WILLIAM DOUBT A FEW DAYS

317
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:41,300
AGO TALKING ABOUT REVISITING THE

318
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,734
FRAMEWORK.

319
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,203
THAT MAY BE THE THEME OF JACKSON

320
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:44,970
HOLE, REVISITING THE FRAMEWORK.

321
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,041
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE QUESTIONING

322
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,176
WHETHER THEIR APPROACH HAS BEEN

323
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,146
EFFECTIVE, HOW SOON MIGHT WE SEE

324
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,217
THIS TRICKLE THROUGH?

325
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,352
>> THE TRICKLING THROUGH HAS TO

326
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,253
BE THROUGH THE POLITICAL CLASS.

327
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:05,090
IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A FISCAL

328
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,925
POLICY THAT IS COHERENT AND TRY

329
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:06,659
TO CALL CLEMENT WHAT MONETARY

330
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:12,298
POLICY HAS DONE -- COMPLEMENT

331
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,233
WHAT MONETARY POLICY HAS DONE,

332
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,402
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THE

333
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,903
POLITICIANS EMBRACE.

334
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,704
DEPENDING ON WHO IS ELECTED IN

335
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:19,538
NOVEMBER AND WHO ENDS UP WINNING

336
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,906
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THERE

337
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:25,911
IS POTENTIAL FOR THERE TO BE

338
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:30,282
SOME CHANGES IN FISCAL POLICY.

339
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,584
BOTH PARTIES ARE TALKING ABOUT

340
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,254
SPENDING MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

341
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,424
WE REALLY DO NEED SOME CHANGES

342
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:38,991
IN FISCAL POLICY.

343
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,329
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE TRYING TO SEE

344
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,396
EXACTLY WHEN THAT CAN HAPPEN AND

345
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,130
WHAT ACTUALLY WOULD HAPPEN.

346
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,902
MARK: SURE.

347
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:50,502
MUCH APPRECIATED.

348
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:51,103
GREAT CONVERSATION.

349
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,440
SCARLET: COMING UP, IS THIS

350
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,542
STILL A HEATED BULL RALLY?

351
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,911
WE SHOW HOW THE STOCK MARKET IS

352
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,645
LURING MORE INVESTORS.

353
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,212
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT POLICE

TANKING.

526
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,279
I THINK IT PICKED UP A LITTLE

527
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,115
BIT OF WIND FROM INVESTORS WHO

528
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,385
WERE LOOKING FOR A SAFE HAVEN.

529
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,953
THEY WERE REMINDED THAT WALMART

00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:42,347

00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,148

541
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:43,815

00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,182

549
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:02,200
OBVIOUSLY, THE TREND IN THE PAST

550
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,767

00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,504

HOLDS.

554
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,842
A BIG DRIVER OF THAT HAS BEEN

555
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,609
THE PRODUCTS THEY ARE SELLING

556
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:13,712
ONLINE.

557
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,546
ITS BASIC MATH.

558
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,715
IF YOU HAVE MORE PRODUCT, YOU

559
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,584
CAN HAVE MORE SALES.

560
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,286
THEY HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED THE

561
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,022
NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THEY SELL

562
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:24,622
ONLINE TO THIRD-PARTY

563
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:27,626
MARKETPLACE SELLERS.

564
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,861
THAT HAS HELPED DRIVE A LOT OF

565
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,528
TRAFFIC TO THE SITE.

566
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,597
IT HAS BEEN A BIG FOCUS.

567
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,732
THEY HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF

568
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:38,770
CRITICISM FOR SALES DECLINING.

569
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,273
I THINK WE ARE SEEING SOME

570
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,073
INVESTMENT IN TURNING THINGS

571
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:46,844
AROUND START TO TAKE HOLD.

572
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,314
AND WE WILL SEE MORE BY THE END

573
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,782
OF THE YEAR WHEN THE ACQUISITION

574
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,584
OF JET.COM IS COMPLETE.

575
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:58,056
SO NEXT YEAR WILL BE A WHOLE NEW

576
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,891
YEAR OF ONLINE SALES.

577
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:05,163
SCARLET: AND AN OUT-OF-CONTROL

578
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:05,997
CRIME PROBLEM IS DRIVING LOCAL

579
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,732
POLICE CRAZY.

580
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,901
EXPLAIN THAT.

581
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,371
>> FOR YEARS NOW, WALMART HAS

582
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,205
REALLY BEEN THE MAJOR SOURCE OF

583
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,041
CRIME IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES.

584
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,676
I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT SMALL

585
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:20,045

00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,156
SOMETIMES THOUSANDS OF TIMES A

591
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,190
YEAR, FOR EVERYTHING FROM

592
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,628
SHOPLIFTING A TOY OR VIDEOGAME

593
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,932
TO VERY SERIOUS, VIOLENT CRIMES,

594
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,767
SHOOTINGS IN THE PARKING LOT.

595
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,302
THERE WAS AN EMPLOYEE KILLED

596
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,504
EARLIER THIS YEAR BY A

597
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:46,971
SHOPLIFTER.

598
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:47,705
SUMMARY PULLED A KNIFE ON AN

599
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:51,509
EMPLOYEE.

600
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,045
-- SOMEBODY PULLED A KNIFE ON AN

601
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:54,479
EMPLOYEE.

602
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,514
THERE IS STILL AN ISSUE OF

603
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,282
SHOPLIFTING AND THEFT GOING ON

604
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:02,420
THAT COSTS THE COMPANY EVERY

605
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,355
YEAR.

606
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:09,661
MARK: OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

607
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,461

614
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,310
I SPOKE TODAY TO A COMMUNITY

615
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,215
PLANNING BOARD IN KANSAS THAT

616
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,016
WAS RAISING THIS EXACT ISSUE.

617
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:33,652
WE DON'T WANT WALMART COMING TO

618
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,486

619
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:36,087
THE POLICE FORCE.

620
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:40,391
IT'S ONE MORE PROBLEM WALMART

621
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:41,359
HASN'T GOTTEN AROUND.

622
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,594
THEY ARE TRYING.

623
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,696
THEY ARE MAKING EFFORTS.

624
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,697
BUT IT IS AN UNDERLYING FACTOR.

625
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:50,101
>> IT'S A GREAT STORY AND

626
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:50,835
EVERYBODY SHOULD FIND IT AND

627
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,202

BEEN A HOT TOPIC FOR DECADES,

705
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,057
BUT THIS YEAR THE ISSUES ARE

706
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,792
BACK ON THE FOREFRONT,

707
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:15,960
PARTICULARLY ON THE U.S.

708
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,527

OBVIOUSLY, TRADING GLOBALIZATION

714
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,075
ARE HUGE TOPICS IN THE ELECTION

715
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:35,246
AND HUGE IN EUROPE AS WELL.

716
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,815
WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET PEOPLE

717
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,217
EXCITED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE

718
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:42,720
IDEA OF GLOBAL TRADE?

719
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,023
>> THE IDEA IS THAT YOU EXPAND

720
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,091
THE PIE, BUT THE PIE IS ALL

721
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:47,892

END SO -- ANSWER THOSE LEFT --

723
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,532
AND SO THOSE LEFT BEHIND ARE NOT

724
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:59,303
TOO EXCITED ABOUT TRADE.

725
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,972
INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES

726
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,206
HAS BEEN WIDENING PRETTY

727
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,241
RELENTLESSLY FOR THE LAST 30-40

728
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,643
YEARS.

729
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:11,581
THE PUBLIC IS NOT BACKING TRADE.

730
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:14,284
WE ALSO HAVE THE POINT THAT

731
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:15,485
HILLARY AND TRUMP ARE BOTH

732
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:17,455
AGAINST THE TPP BUT THE

733
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,358
PRESIDENT IS STILL PUSHING IT TO

734
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,826
A LAME DUCK CONGRESS.

735
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,627
THERE IS A LOT OF MANEUVERING

736
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,328
BEHIND THE SCENES TO PUSH THIS

737
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,696
THROUGH EVEN THOUGH THE PUBLIC

738
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,397
IS NOT TOO HAPPY WITH IT.

739
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:31,135
SCARLET: WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR

740
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:31,902
WITH HOW GLOBALIZATION HAS

741
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:32,703
CREATED A LOT OF LOSERS IN THE

742
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,505
DEVELOP WORLD, IN THE U K, IN

743
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,141
THE U.S. 

744
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:42,580
WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF

745
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,781
GLOBALIZATION FOR EMERGING

746
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,215
ECONOMIES?

747
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,382
IT IS EASY TO THINK THAT CHINA

748
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:49,920
AND MEXICO WIN, BUT THERE ARE

749
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,489
LOSERS IN THOSE ECONOMIES AS

750
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,757
WELL, AREN'T THERE?

751
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,360
>> IN GENERAL, MARKETS CREATE

752
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,161
INEQUALITY, AND USUALLY, YOU

753
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,698
NEED GOVERNMENT POLICY TO CLOSE

754
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,466
THE GAPS TO REDUCE IT.

755
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:06,170
IN CHINA, WHICH IS THE MOST

756
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,106
SPECTACULAR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

757
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:09,940
IN HISTORY, INEQUALITY HAS ALSO

758
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,843
SOARED.

759
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,612
HERE, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

760
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,880
TRADE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED

761
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,881
STATES, AND WE POINT TO CHINA

762
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:21,652
SAYING THAT TOOK AWAY A LOT OF

763
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,286
MANUFACTURING JOBS.

764
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,354
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

765
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,188
THERE IS A LOT OF UNREST AND A

766
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:29,360
LOT OF CONCERN IN CHINA, HOW DO

767
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,061
WE MANAGE THIS AS WELL?

768
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:34,165
MARK: I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

769
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,133
POINT THAT THERE IS

770
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:41,172
GLOBALIZATION THAT IS A SLICE OF

771
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,041
THE PIE GOING TO A CERTAIN GROUP

772
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,177
OF PEOPLE.

773
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,814
HAS THAT SLICE GOTTEN LARGER OR

774
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,849
IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PERSON

775
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,018
GETTING LEFT BEHIND AND THOSE

776
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,119
ARE THE PEOPLE REACTING NOW?

777
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,254
>> THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS GROWN.

778
00:35:57,254 --> 00:36:04,228
ON THE WHOLE, BESIDES 2008,

779
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,029
FALLING OUT OF BED, THE ECONOMY

780
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,932
HAS GROWN PRETTY WELL OVER THE

781
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,867
COURSE OF THE LAST GENERATION,

782
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,769
EVEN LONGER.

783
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:12,636
BUT THE INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED

784
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:13,404
STATES, ESPECIALLY AT THE VERY

785
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:18,342
TOP, THE FAMOUS 1%, ARE NOW AT

786
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,346
AND IN CASH AT AN IMPRESSIVELY

787
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,183
HIGH SHARE.

788
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,752
-- ARE NOW ADDED IMPRESSIVELY

789
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,219
HIGH SHARE.

790
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,253
SO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE DONALD

791
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:33,491
TRUMP IS APPEALING TO AN

792
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,393
CONTESTED RUST BELT STATES THAT

793
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,027
LOST THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR,

794
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:38,329
THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE LOSSES

795
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,631
OCCURRED, THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

796
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,465
NOW, THE RESEARCH SHOWS MORE AND

797
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:47,571
MORE THAT COMPETITION WITH CHINA

798
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:48,372
REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

799
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,375
MY VIEW IS THAT TRADE ON THE

800
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,679
WHOLE CAN BE GOOD, BUT IF WE ARE

801
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,513
IN A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT SAYS

802
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,348
TOUGH LUCK TO YOU, YOU ARE BEING

803
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,617
LEFT BEHIND, DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE

804
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:04,121
TO BE OVERJOYED ABOUT TRADE.

805
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,524
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT HAS BEEN THE

806
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,325
ATTITUDE FOR SEVERAL

807
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:08,793
GENERATIONS.

808
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,094
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE

809
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,128
SAID TRADE IS GOOD.

810
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,798
NOW NAFTA, NOW THIS, NOW TPP,

811
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:17,802
AND IF YOU ARE A LOSER, TOUGH.

812
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,669
THAT IS NOT GOING TO SELL

813
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,704
ANYMORE.

814
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,739
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO PUSH IT

815
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,340
THROUGH IN THE LAME-DUCK

816
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,774
SESSION.

817
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:24,775
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

818
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,477
DISGRACEFUL TO TAKE SOMETHING SO

819
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,279
IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

820
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,614
THAT BOTH CANDIDATES ARE

821
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:32,583
AGAINST, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS

822
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,384
ABSOLUTELY GOING TO TRY EVERY

823
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,787
MANEUVER TO GET IT THROUGH IN,

824
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,989
WHAT I THINK IT IS NOT A VERY

825
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:39,690
DEMOCRATIC WAY, AFTER THE

826
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,827
ELECTION.

827
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:47,965
JOE: YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT

828
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:48,799
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE

829
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,501
DISTRIBUTION RIGHT, THAT YOU

830
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,769
CAN'T HAVE ALL THE GAINS GOING

831
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,904
TO THE TOP.

832
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,173
ONE FACTOR OF THAT IS THAT

833
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:56,907
CAPITALIZATION CAN LEAVE THE

834
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:57,308
COUNTRY.

835
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,943
THERE ARE PEOPLE MOVING MONEY

836
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,310
OUT.

837
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,814
THERE ARE TECHNICAL

838
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:12,356
ASPECTS TO DISTRIBUTION.

839
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,057
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

840
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,661
DOMESTICALLY TO ADDRESS THE

841
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:19,797
RAMIFICATIONS OF GLOBALIZATION

842
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,734
BECAUSE JUST MOVING MONEY AROUND

843
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,603
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WILL SOLVE

844
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,070
THE ISSUE.

845
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,639
>> FIRST, CAPITAL IS A MOBILE

846
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,141
FACTOR AND CAPITAL HAS BEEN THE

847
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:31,575
BIG WINNER.

848
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:32,276
WHEN YOU HAVE INTERNATIONAL

849
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,245
CAPITAL -- WHICH IS THE NEW

850
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,045
WORLD ECONOMY IN THE MOST RECENT

851
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:39,550
YEARS -- THEN THERE IS ALSO A

852
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,719
TENDENCY OF A RACE TO THE

853
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,152
BOTTOM.

854
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:43,054
WE HAVE TO CUT TAXES BECAUSE

855
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,122
THEY ARE CUTTING TAXES.

856
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,124
UNLESS THERE IS GLOBAL

857
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,894
COOPERATION, YOU END UP WITH THE

858
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:50,728
PANAMA PAPERS, TAX HAVENS, SOME

859
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:54,065
BIG COMPANIES BASICALLY NOT

860
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,200
PAYING TAXES BECAUSE THERE ARE

861
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,169
SO MANY GIMMICKS IN THE TAX CODE

862
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,770
THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR

863
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,305
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE

864
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,106
CAYMANS OR BERMUDA EVEN THOUGH

865
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,508
IT WAS MADE IN OUR UNIVERSITIES.

866
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:09,980
BUT THEY DON'T PUT TAXES ON --

867
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,449
PAY TAXES ON THAT ANYMORE.

868
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,283
YOU NEED GLOBAL COOPERATION.

869
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:18,155
IT'S ALSO TRUE -- BY THE WAY,

870
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:18,856
INCOME DISTRIBUTION HELPS.

871
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,190
IF YOU ARE IN A STRUGGLING

872
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,594
FAMILY, YOU DON'T MIND HAVING

873
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:26,830
EASIER TAXES ARE A HIGHER EARNED

874
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,865
INCOME TAX CREDIT, OR WHATEVER

875
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,767
IT IS, BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT

876
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,936
WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM ON

877
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,770
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THIS YEAR,

878
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,537
WHICH IS THAT ONE WAY OUT OF

879
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:39,076
THIS IS HIGHER SKILLS AND MORE

880
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:39,710
DEGREES.

881
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,477
GOING FOR A MASTER'S OR

882
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:41,278
BACHELOR.

883
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,113
POOR KIDS CAN'T DO THAT.

884
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,515
WE HAVE A TRILLION DOLLARS OF

885
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:44,915
DEBT.

886
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:48,786
THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HANDLED

887
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:49,553
THIS BEST ARE THE NORTHERN

888
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,556
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

889
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,290
THEY HAVE FREE TUITION.

890
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,626
THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE BERNIE HAD

891
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,495
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

892
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,864
THAT REQUIRES REVENUE TO PAY FOR

893
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:00,264
IT.

894
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:00,931
THAT REQUIRES TAXATION.

895
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,801
WE ARE BACK TO THE SAME INCOME

896
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:04,668
DISTRIBUTION POINT I AM MAKING

897
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,470
WHICH IS, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE

898
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,573
TRADE, WHICH I DO, YOU NEED

899
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,342
REDISTRIBUTION, BUT IF YOU HAVE

900
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,644
REDISTRIBUTION, YOU NEED TO DO

901
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:14,645
IT IN A SMART WAY, YOU NEED

902
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,548
COOPERATION, AND YOU NEED TO

903
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,349
HAVE SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND SO

904
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:18,682
ON.

905
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,451
BUT THAT REQUIRES SOMEBODY

906
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:23,587
PAYING THEIR TAXES.

907
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:29,360
SCARLET: AND IT HAS TO BE

908
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,960
SUSTAINABLE.

909
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,928
FREE TUITION IN EUROPE, THERE'S

910
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,565
AN UNDERCLASS OF DOCTORAL

911
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,602
STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE JOBS.

912
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,038
>> TO HAVE AN AVERAGE INCOME I

913
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:46,677
WE DO, $50,000, $55,000 PER

914
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,879
PERSON, THAT IS A SOPHISTICATED

915
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:49,313
ECONOMY.

916
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,080
YOU NEED SOPHISTICATED POLICIES

917
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,651
AS WELL.

918
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,620
THE REALLY GOOD PERFORMING

919
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,588
ECONOMIES INVEST IN SCIENCE AND

920
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,622
TECHNOLOGY.

921
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,124
WHERE DID THEY GET THE MONEY?

922
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,359
YOU NEED REVENUE TO BE ABLE TO

923
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:02,793
DO THAT.

924
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,560
BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AHEAD AND

925
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,062
SAY WE ARE GOING TO BUILD SKILLS

926
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,998
AND JOBS IN A BALANCED WAY.

927
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,634
WE GAVE UP ON THAT INSTEAD LET

928
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,602
THE TOP <GO> FOR IT.

929
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,736
IT WILL TRICKLE DOWN.

930
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:19,209
WE -- AND SAID LET THE TOP GO

931
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,411
FOR IT.

932
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,313
IT WILL TRICKLE DOWN.

933
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,180
WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR 40

934
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,647
YEARS NOW.

935
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,917
MARK: REALLY POOR AND

936
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:27,451
CONVERSATION.

937
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,085
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

938
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,989
SCARLET: COMING UP, DONALD TRUMP

939
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,890
MAKING A BIG COMEBACK.

00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,834
ABSENT.

1125
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,705
ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

1126
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,673
PART IN A BIDDING MORE?

1127
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:35,911
BETTY: ABSOLUTELY NOT.

1128
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,681
JOHN IS RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT

1129
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,983
HE HAS BEEN GAINING SUBSCRIBERS

1130
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,585
WHILE OTHERS, LIKE VERIZON,

1131
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:43,319
AT&T, AND SPRINT, HAVE BEEN

1132
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,755
LOSING.

1133
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,058
THERE IS NO SITTING BACK AT ALL

1134
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:48,825
FOR ANY OF THESE CARRIERS,

1135
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:57,734
ESPECIALLY VERIZON, BUT WHEN I

1136
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,236
TALK TO HIM ABOUT SPRINT, HE

1137
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,639
SAID FORGET SPRINT, I AM TALKING

1138
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,173
ABOUT VERIZON.

1139
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,007
HE IS REALLY GOING AFTER MARKET

1140
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:04,741
SHARE.

1141
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:10,113
ALL OF THIS MAKES JOHN AND HIS

1142
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:10,914
PINK T-SHIRT PRETTY ATTRACTIVE,

1143
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,049
RIGHT?

1144
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:13,850
SOFTBANK HAS COME OUT -- THERE

1145
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,787
WAS AN ARTICLE ON BLOOMBERG

1146
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,589
WHERE HE SAID HE STILL HOPES

1147
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,225
THERE IS A MERGER POSSIBILITY

1148
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:22,759
WITH T-MOBILE.

1149
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,861
HERE IS WHAT JOHN SAID TO THAT.

1150
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,930
JOHN: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

1151
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,465
LOOKING TO WHAT THEY COULD

1152
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,667
POSSIBLY DO WITH T-MOBILE, AND I

1153
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,835
WOULD JUST TELL THEM, IT'S SORT

1154
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,470

00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,104

1163
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,128
THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

1164
00:54:59,128 --> 00:54:59,929

1165
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:00,964

COMBINING A THIRD AND FOURTH
