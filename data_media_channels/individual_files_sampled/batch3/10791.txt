Pentagon has acknowledged that it conducted an unsuccessful missile defense test on Wednesday the missile was launched from land and failed to intercept an incoming target launched from an aircraft over Hawaii a pentagon spokesperson confirmed the incident yesterday during a press briefing it did not meet our objectives but we'll learn something all the time with these tests and we learned something from this one and will continue to improve our capabilities all right to shed light on the issue Michael Maloof a former Pentagon official is joining us alive now Michael when something like this happens you're always the person who has the right information for us so let's get to the Trump administration they have reiterated support for development of this missile defense using the North Korean nuclear threat as justification however after this latest test failure what is the future of a system like this well there's no other choice but to continue trying to perfect it this is actually a modification of previous models of the sm-3 as it's called it's part of the it's off of the so-called Aegis platform a type of missile that's about ready to be deployed in Romania for example they have a lot of bugs and you got to consider too that when you're shooting shooting a missile like this it's like trying to knock a bullet with a he had a bullet with another bullet it's a it's very very difficult and and what's what's a little disturbing is that this is the second failure since June I believe and the the the and they were up they were both shot under controlled conditions so if this missile if a missile is fired an anger from let's say North Korea and it's coming in at at a terrific speed the the likelihood of that missile hitting that incoming is going to be extremely difficult again that would not be under controlled conditions and and if the North Koreans for example were to do a swarm approach with four or five missiles at a time it absolutely overload the system so something's going to get through so it's it's the the system itself needs a lot of work and you're talking about technology levels that are still in the infant stage and it's it's very difficult what they're talking about in some cases is maybe working on like a modified SDI or Strategic Defense Initiative program and actually having launchers in space because that's going to be an important future actually in trying to down missiles or even satellites that could in effect be nuclear weapons but I think that for now it that the best the best time really to hit a missile in this case would be once it's once it's launched just after it's launched but it could be a test and and and that's one of the dilemmas facing policymakers and defense experts as to is that missile a test or is it the real thing and that that's so there's a long way to go in this development program frankly Michael you I want to go back to something you brought up just a bit ago north and Korea of course missile tests don't happen in a vacuum there's the political situation as well if the Pentagon isn't sure its missile defense system is reliable is it a good idea for the u.s. president to be provoking North Korea by engaging in a war of words with Kim Jeong Runa well I take your point and the answer is absolutely not in fact that feeds his narrative of that the United States is really out to to do away with his regime and and in survival for Kim jong-un is absolutely critical and and essential and so any kind of military exercises any sending b-2s from Guam to do practice runs over just south of the North Korean border above the 38th parallel parallel or the DMZ zone it's it's it's it's tantamount to a provocation in the eyes of the North Koreans and and we should be doing we already have three carrier task forces right off of North Korea right now and those are all provocations to try to put maximum pressure on him but if he feels cornered he may do the very thing that we're trying to prevent and that is unleash now his nukes would probably not be used on South Korea that's too close but he certainly could open up with a barrage of artillery that he has his 10,000 artillery pieces along the DMZ hidden deep deeply bed embedded in mountains so it's it to have that kind of a provocation doesn't serve any purpose and also it doesn't get him to do away with his nuclear and missiles that that that this administration has pledged will be done on Donald Trump's watch but I've heard that I've seen this movie before and it just hasn't happened yet even when it was in the development stage we still we have seen this movie play out we haven't seen how it ends yet and unfortunately since it's one of those movies that just keeps playing and playing and playing and hopefully it can find an end to it sometime soon Michael Maloof incredibly interesting to hear your thoughts former Pentagon official with us here on RT International thank you
