the exclusive hotel where the summit will be held has already been placed in a closed security zone Singapore with a venue for high-stakes diplomacy which may go on for several days but it's arguable the fact this historic meeting is even taking place is a victory in itself for Kim jong-un his country has sought a meeting with the US president for many years and he's achieved that goal without making any concrete commitment on denuclearization I think Kim is a much canny or operator than we give him a lot of credit for certainly in the United States and other circles I think that he has got exposure to the outside world he got through his education in Switzerland and I think that he's got advisers who understand the outside world pretty well even if they prefer to live in in you know their relative isolation inside of North Korea and I think that he is doing a great job at playing the United States and the fact that we're seeing is volatile and risky right now in his interactions with the Chinese and South Korean those two countries are key to summit meetings now with South Korea's president moon jae-in the North Korean leader has shown a different face to the world a man smiling and prepared to negotiate and after reaching out diplomatically to the u.s. experts now believe it'll be very hard to persuade North Korea's main trading partner China to impose fresh sanctions if the summit is not a success I think it'll be very difficult to return to the maximum pressure campaign of last year and early this year because North Korea has indicated it's willing to negotiate to work towards denuclearization he's reached out to Beijing and Seoul and sort of got them on his side and so I think it'll be very hard to get China to cooperate at least on the economic portion of the maximum pressure campaign much of course depends on what goes on around the negotiating table Trump prides himself on the art of the deal but Kim is the one who intimately knows the secrets of his country and its nuclear program the world will be watching the diplomacy here in Singapore in the coming hours and days it could determine the future of the Korean Peninsula James BAE's al Jazeera Singapore
