I'm here on the guards and border looking into Gaza and about a kilometer in the distance there's smoke that you can see that's the result of the Palestinians and their kites they're launching them over into Israel in order to try and burn the crops and the fields of the farmers and also caused damage so that's the smoke that you can see there in the foreground there's a wall that you can make out a cream wall that makes up the border between the strip and Israel and interestingly that wall not only acts as a defense in itself but it goes down these the ground 40 meters so 40 meters below the ground to the point where it meets the water and the point of that is to stop Hamas and the Palestinians tunneling through into Israeli territory so I guess if there's a message for Donald Trump here it's build the wall and don't just build the wall build that wall down 40 meters also I'm here with the team from rebel media and we are bringing you the truths that the mainstream media won't tell you about Israel right here on the border of the girls and strip if you want to hear more about our journalism please do join us at rebel is real calm
