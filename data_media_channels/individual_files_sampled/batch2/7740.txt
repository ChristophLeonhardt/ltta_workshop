Trump has some very creative ways of referring to people and his latest tweet attacking LeBron and Don Lemon is no exception Trump tweeted that LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television Don Lemon he made LeBron look smart if you still don't want to believe that Trump is a racist ladies and gentlemen I have the documents here's Trump's tally according to trump Barack Obama's a Kenyan Maxine Waters is low IQ black athletes are sons of bitches Nigerians living Hut's black people aren't good enough for housing Central Park 5 deserve to be executed even though they were proven to be innocent Mexicans or drug dealers and rapists Muslims are terrorists and the only people whose plight we should sympathize with are Nazis and the people who marched with those Nazis they're very fine people here's on erlang stupidity of being a racist you try to label people as idiots even if they're tremendously successful like LeBron who's obviously way better than Trump in almost every category but especially when it comes to education NBA superstar LeBron James and his foundation are opening this school in Akron for a tres third and fourth graders who struggle both in school and at home at Trump University we teach success that's what it's all about success imagine thinking you're better than the guy who built a public school for at-risk kids when the only school you've ever built preyed on at-risk families just look at this difference it offers an innovative approach a longer class day and a longer school year and provides support to help kids with trauma and started looking at Trump University and discovered that it was a classic bait-and-switch scheme it was a scam starting with the fact that it was not a university on the one hand you have a board kid from Akron who became arguably the greatest athlete of all time working hard and giving back to his community by building a public school with his own money and then on the other hand you have a snake oil salesman born with a silver spoon in his mouth who scammed poor families by building a fake school in got caught Trump University has agreed to settle the civil fraud lawsuit for 25 million dollars a kid from Akron leaving a legacy of hope for children Trump's administration also is adding insult to injury by destroying public schools across the country currently even after over well mning evidence of the contrary the fact that Trump has the gall to call LeBron dumb after years of trying to add him on Twitter shows us the sad frivolous stupid nature of racism it also shows the double standard for free speech here in America black people can't protest loudly in the streets they can't protest quietly during the anthem and they're not even allowed to criticize this administration in an interview about the future of this country even after they've demonstrated how much they care and that double standard is also rooted in racism I'm a psalm pygar if you prefer president Braun / president dong please share this video with your friends also don't forget to leave your thoughts in the comment section below also please download the TYT app it's now available on android as well as the Apple App Store and this has been the breakdown
