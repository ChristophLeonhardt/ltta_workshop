Allisyn Hartson has a new ad for her Senate race against Dianne Feinstein and it's a doozy I'm Alison Hudson and I've never slept as a porn star I've also never called anyone a China person nor am I an not see that's why the media isn't covering my campaign I have been a public schoolteacher for ten years and led a national nonprofit to end political corruption but that doesn't raise anyone's ratings so media would rather give billions in free advertising to clowns and actual Nazis I'm going to fight for Medicare for all higher wages and college education for your kids I'm Alison Hartson and I approve this message because you deserve somebody who's going to represent you not corporate donors I really like her her slogan or I guess slogans people over profit policy over politics that's perfect I wish I could take credit for that but I can't I didn't come up with that but I wish I did people over profit policy over politics yeah if I ever run for office Allison I'm taking that that's just a great ad it's just a great ad it's true I mean the media finds right-wing activism and in fact far right-wing activism inherently sexy they do Nazism great example there's literally a Nazi running for office there's been a few recently but a literal Nazi running for office as a Republican and I think it's California and so he's been on some of the major networks has Allison nope and this is what it is man you know Donald Trump they they preferred to show and this is even MSNBC and CNN they preferred to show his empty podium over an actual Bernie Sanders speech happening in real time now that shows that they thrive off of sensationalism and they thrive off of creating scanned and without even realize it making it seem like the far right is sexy you know the they their hair is on fire like when do I always think back to that commercial about Donald Trump with where I think was other Republicans who went after him for him cursing and it was just a long ad with just him cursing over and over and over and over and over and I kept seeing they kept talking about it on CNN and MSNBC and they thought like it was a great ad meanwhile I'm watching it I'm going if you know nothing else about Trump and you watch this everybody would walk away from that going I like that guy because he's cursing he's just being a normal person there was another instance of CNN went nuts and covered it for half a day when Donald Trump was at a rally and said the TPP is gonna rape you or like rape the country the fact that he used the word rape they invited on all these mik feminists who were like how dare you use that word that word evokes a lot of negative emotions and people who've experienced it and anybody who's watching this who knows nothing about Donald Trump goes oh he doesn't want our jobs to be outsourced from the trade deal because regular people see the word rape in that context and they understand that it's a stand-in word for you know these trade deals are gonna destroy you like kill the middle class because we're not you know devoid of context we can look at it and understand but they just flipped out oh my god he use the word rape this is the kind of free media where even though it was negative media where they were trying to take him down that it actually helped him so the fact that they didn't cover Bernie Sanders almost at all and there's been studies tracking this as to how much they cover the different candidates Bernie Sanders got next to no coverage now if he got any more coverage be it even negative coverage he would have fared even better I think and maybe even one now obviously was rigged against him at the DNC level that's clear the WikiLeaks emails prove that but if they even did negative coverage of him it would have helped more because that's when people go oh what's going on over here well the the real enemy of the popular movement is indifference and that's what Allison hearts ins pointing out here she's like the media will not cover me why because oh I don't know maybe I led an organization that's trying to end corruption in America that trying to get money out of the system and have publicly financed elections and get an amendment to the Constitution there's nothing sexy about that now is there there's nothing scandalous or sensationalistic about that that's just the right thing to do and it's a great thing to have on your record and it's a great thing to be crusading for you know and then she says I'm for Medicare for all I'm for free college you know I'm gonna fight for these things that are gonna help your families so they're not gonna cover me that's true that's true and this should be a wake-up call of the media but it won't be it won't be because you know you're not serious unless you get the blessing of the establishment that's really the mindset and that's why in every article about this election they leave out virtually every candidate the only ones they'll talk about Dianne Feinstein and every now and then Kevin de Lyonne because Kevin de Lyonne is the second establishment candidate so you have Dianne Feinstein who's just is the establishment then you have Kevin de Leon who would like to be the establishment and so all the non-establishment candidates Shh shut up no talking about them so that's why we got to work around the corporate media we got to work around all these inherent built-in biases so Allison Hartson you got to go vote for
