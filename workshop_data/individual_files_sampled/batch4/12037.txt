well this is pretty exciting I just read that Bill and Hillary Clinton are launching a national stadium tour they're going to be I don't know if they're gonna be speaking or dancing singing on my show but they're gonna be doing a whole stadium show going around the country packing stadiums and I think they're stopping at a stadium near me in fact unfortunately I'm not gonna be able to make it because I had plans to gouge out my own eyes that evening but I'm sure it will be a lovely lovely event and so I think that's pretty wonderful all right I want to mention two stories here very first very briefly I got to mention this from the headline is from CNN Heidi Heitkamp the senator from North Dakota was ready to vote YES on Kavanagh then she then she watched him with the sound off that's the headline having been just one of three Democratic senators to vote to confirm President Donald Trump's first Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch Heitkamp had already instructed her staff to begin drafting a statement explaining why she thought Cavanaugh deserved her vote as well then Christine Ford came forward and accused Cavan of sexually assaulting her she watched Ford's testimony it says and then she watched Cavanaugh's and then she watched Cavanaugh's again but this time with the sound off it's something I do she said we communicate not only with words but with our body language and demeanor I saw somebody who was very angry who was very nervous I saw rage and a lot of people said well of course you're going to see rage he's being falsely accused but it is at all times that you're supposed to acquit yourself with a demeanor that's becoming of the court Heitkamp said so she's literally admitting that she judged him based on how he looked when he spoke not based on what he said not based on the content of what he was saying but based on the mean faces that he made as he said it that's a set what she's saying is well well maybe he was telling the truth but he made mean he made mean faces while he did so so so I voted against him now I don't really believe that she did that I don't think that she watched the Kavanagh hearing and then she watched again with the sound off because that would be a very strange thing to do but I think this is her way around the kind of the charge that she voted against an innocent man based on false charges what she's saying is well I wasn't even listening to what I was just going based on body language okay yeah you could you can read a lot based on body language but you have to pair that with what the person is saying you can't you can't just watch them devoid of context devoid of what they're actually saying and then make make judgments based on their body language obviously now speaking of feelings over facts maybe you heard about this the astronaut scott Kelly tweeted a Winston Churchill quote a couple of days ago the tweet got him into some trouble this is what the tweet said the tweet was this is what he said one of the greatest leaders of modern times Sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over and that was a very controversial you hear that that tweet and you say wow that's controversial I that's some controversial stuff that's pretty edgy there Scott Kelly now this was I'm assuming an attack on Republicans who were celebrating the Cavanaugh confirmation because that's he tweeted it when I assume that's what he was doing there so he was agreeing with Louie it should have made liberals happy he was agreeing with them he was criticizing Republicans they should have been pleased with that but they weren't they came after Scott Kelly apparently on the basis that Churchill was a racist imperialist etc so then Kelley followed that tweet with possibly the most embarrassing we ever published even amidst the daily deluge of of embarrassing tweets this is what he said he said did not did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views which I do not support my point was we need to come together as one nation we are all Americans that should transcend partisan politics now there is so much to unpack here there's so much in this one little incident because it's emblematic of where we are as society so first you see again as I frequently remark you see the way that the left is just never satisfied ever with anything even if you agree with them even if you take their side they'll still go after you if you don't agree and take their side in the right way using the right words avoiding all the various different landmines that are set out if you don't do that then that they'll attack you and they'll attack you in the same way that they would have if you were all the way on the other side on the opposite side from them so you're either 100% on there so we talked about this yesterday it's the way the left operates either you're 100% on their side with everything and in everything that you say or you're the enemy there's no in-between at all right this is liberal I mean they're basically like they're like the kid on Halloween that goes up to the to the to the bowl of candy left out on the porch and then cries because it doesn't have Snickers like you're being given free candy and you still find a reason to whine about actually I think this is a better analogy I've used this analogy before but the modern left is very similar to if you've ever read that book when you were a kid the book if you give a mouse a cookie and as you may recall in that book the child gives them a cookie to a mouse and then the mouse wants a napkin and then the mouse wants a glass of milk and then it keeps demanding more and more things until finally the child is given away all of his belongings and all of his food and his family is left destitute on the street and they all starve to death well that's not exactly how the book ends I don't read well that's that's the but that's the idea and honestly I'm not sure what the moral of that story could be other than as a cautionary tale about appealing left appeasing leftist right I don't know what else I mean maybe that but it could be practical advice to don't give them cookie to a mouse a good practical unless it's laced with rat poison or something but aside from that I mean this this this is really exactly how the left operates you give them a cookie they want the next thing they want the next they're never going to be satiated never satisfied so that's the first thing second I think for a moment we should just kind of step back and admire the sheer cowardice on display here because it's it's almost artful it's almost beautiful I think the coward is just how perfect the cowardice is okay this is an astronaut okay a guy whose job most definitely does not depend on public approval this is this is basically the last guy in the world who should worry what the mob thinks it makes no difference at all what are people gonna do boycott NASA this guy I mean he spends his time off the earth he's literally off the earth in space he should be as as far removed in a literal sense and as unconcerned with the opinions of the pinna gallery as you could possibly be yet he backed down and apologized why and and look at this remarkable turnaround so he sent the original tweet at noon about the Churchill quote and then he sent the next one apologizing at 7:00 so in seven hours he went from believing the Churchill was one of the greatest world leaders in modern history to believing that he was a racist guilty of various atrocities that's and you have to believe that Scott Kelly you know he's quoting churchill saying he's a great world leader so he's probably thought that churchill was a hero for his whole life i'd imagine you don't generally go around quoting people unless you have an affinity for them unless you admire them so Kelly abandoned a presumably long-held conviction that Churchill was a great world leader and ran all the way to the other extreme labeling him a racist guilty of atrocities in the span of an afternoon that's all that's all the time that it took for him to say you know what yeah it was wrong about this my whole life third third thing and this gives me a chance to underline a point that I I'm constantly making but it's an important point never apologize to the mob this is what happens never ever apologize to them the problem with apologizing to the mob is that first of all it's it's always going to be a disingenuous apology because nobody ever has a real authentic moment of self-reflection where they were real where they realize they were wrong about something because a bunch of idiots are screaming in their face that's not it's possible to say something and then reflect on it and and later say you know what I was wrong about that shouldn't have said it but in order for that to happen it requires a little bit of reflection a little bit of right but if people are if there's a mob screaming in your face that's not and you and you apologize in response to that most likely you're apologizing just to get them to shut up but you won't shut shut them up in fact you're only gonna make it worse on yourself because all the people who were mad at Kelly for quoting Churchill they're still mad and they're mad because they were never really mad to begin with their anger is performative as anger is so often you know as so is so often the case with anger and modern society its performative they're just taking advantage of an opportunity to jump on a dog pile they're there they're not gonna stop just because you apologized only sincere people are satiated by apologies if you're genuinely offended by something that somebody said or did and then they apologize then then what you're gonna say is okay you know no harm no foul thank you for apologizing and then you'll move on but you notice that that never happens there's a lot of performative anger there are a lot of apologies happening every day but it's like nobody ever says apology accepted have you noticed that apologies are never accepted ever anymore nobody ever accepts an apology because the people who are being apologized to the people that are receiving the apology they they were never angry there's there's actually not anything to apologize for so this is a disingenuous apology being given to people who are disingenuously fraudulently offended so it's it's all it's all a charade it's all pointless and then you just compound your problem because what happened to Kelly is he originally tweeted the Churchill quote and he he had to deal with the performative anger of the left-wing mob and then he apologizes and they're still angry quote unquote but now you also have mockery and disgust from the other side now you have people like me and many others making fun of you for it so all you've done is you've just you've just you've just you've turned everybody away you've alienated everybody which is the way that this always works I mean how many times do we have to see it this have any times we have to see this play out before we see this is how it works when you apologize to the mob it's not gonna stop them and all you do is you disappoint and and alienate and earn the scorn of the people who would have otherwise defended you so don't apologize to the mob especially if you're an astronaut and there's absolutely no do anything to you there's no reason to worry about what they're saying about you but even those of us who are not astronauts I think we could take a lesson from this this will be this is our 50th such lesson in the last month never apologize to the mob I'm not saying never apologize period in your life there may be times to apologize but don't apologize to these people don't apologize to angry internet trolls don't apologize to these rabid swarms of of phony charlatans who are just really super excited for the opportunity to be offended by something don't don't apologize to them and I would say that even if you really are wrong which obviously Scott Kelly was not wrong in quoting churchill but even if you say something and you're actually wrong about what you said well still don't apologize to the mob because they're not owed an apology well why are they owed an apology why are a bunch of idiots on the internet why do you if the pot they didn't hurt them if there really is an apology owed to a specific person then go apologize to them but not to the not to the mob whether you're wrong or right they don't deserve it it only encourages them all right so that's our that's our lesson that we can all learn for the day thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
