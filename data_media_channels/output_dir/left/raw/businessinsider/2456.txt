00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,900
- [Narrator] The Trump
campaign's officially licensed

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,920
Make America Great Again or MAGA hats,

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,380
are made here, at the
Cali-Fame headwear factory

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,610
in Carson, California, just
outside of Los Angeles.

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,290
- The fabric, the cord, the plastic strap,

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,920
the fabric underneath, the sweatband,

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,480
the whole hat is made here in America.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,240
- [Narrator] The company
doesn't only make MAGA hats.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,600
It specializes in all kinds of headwear,

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,670
which it manufactures and customizes.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,740
But the company has worked
with Trump for years.

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,810
Before the campaign, Cali-Fame

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,030
made hats for Trump's golf courses.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,810
- We've been making golf
hats since the '50s.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,500
Cali-Fame Los Angeles was one of the first

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,520
golf hat manufacturers.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,800
- [Narrator] The red
MAGA hat retails for $25.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,630
Every purchase of a MAGA hat,

19
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,560
along with any other item for sale

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,680
on the Trump campaign's official website,

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,783
counts as a campaign contribution.

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,690
Around 100 employees work in the factory,

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,780
and according to an
interview Brian Kennedy did

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,170
with the Los Angeles Times in 2015,

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,380
around 80% of the workforce is Latino.

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,960
And according to the Trump campaign,

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,200
all employees are verified U.S. citizens.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,370
We didn't speak to any
employees during our shoot.

29
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,520
- Do I look like Trump?

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,900
- [Narrator] But in 2015,
MSNBC visited the factory

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,270
and reporter Jacob Soboroff
spoke to some of the workers.

32
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,103
- When you heard that Trump,

33
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:36,936
you're gonna make the hats for Trump,

34
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,450
what was the first thought
that went through your mind?

35
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,990
- Well, more work for us.

36
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,940
- Some of the stuff that he's said,

37
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,030
it's not been particularly
nice to the Latino community.

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,130
When you guys hear some of
that stuff, what do you think?

39
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,740
- I just try to ignore it.

40
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,290
- [Narrator] Making the hats
requires a 23-step process,

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,700
much of which is done by hand.

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,793
- So the way we manufacture the hat,

43
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,963
the first process is spreading material.

44
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,423
We take it right to
the embroidery machine,

45
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:06,710
and then from embroidery

46
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,490
we're taking it right
to the sewing operation

47
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,580
where we're creating both the
bill and the crown separately,

48
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,800
so that eventually we put
these two parts together

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,570
by attaching the sweatband, finishing it

50
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,540
with the plastic strap
that's made in the U.S.

51
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,010
Then we steam the hat, press the hat,

52
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,430
and we also finish the
cord and glue that down

53
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,470
before we pack the hat.

54
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,340
- [Narrator] The hats are
shipped to the headquarters

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,080
of Ace Specialties in
Lafayette, Louisiana.

56
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,460
Ace is the Trump campaign's

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,350
official merchandise distributor,

58
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,500
and the company fulfills all orders

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,140
from the Trump campaign's website.

60
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,700
According to the Trump campaign,

61
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,690
hundreds of thousands of MAGA hats

62
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,720
have been sold since
Trump's campaign began.

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,480
- We are one of the few American
companies left making hats.

64
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,580
There is a need, a niche,
for that American product,

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,260
and that's what we've
been really striving for

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,390
the last couple of years.

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,520
It's an incredible
opportunity to make this hat

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,250
for the President of the United States.

69
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,960
I think that this hat is an icon

70
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,720
for what is going on in the country

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
and we're really happy to make
the hat for the president.

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,921
Hopefully we can keep this going.

73
00:03:15,921 --> 00:00:00,000
(gentle music, sewing machines running)
