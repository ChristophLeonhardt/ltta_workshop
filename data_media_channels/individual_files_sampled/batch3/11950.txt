the International chemical weapons watchdog the OPCW met on Wednesday over the scruple case Russia proposed a joint investigation but that idea was rejected we will not agree to Russia's demand to conduct a joint investigation into the attack in Salisbury because the UK has assessed that it is highly likely that the Russian state is responsible for this attack and that there is no plausible alternative explanation there is no requirement in the Chemical Weapons Convention for a victim to engage the likely perpetrator in a joint investigation to do so would be perverse unfortunately we didn't manage to get the needed two-thirds of votes for the resolution to pass obviously the Brits and Americans voted against and then NATO and some EU Member States and US allies followed suits they fear the truth they fear to take responsibility for their words for blatant accusations for provocative statements from the head of UK diplomacy the UK's representative to the OPCW set out more claims against Russia at the meeting linking the screw Powell poisoning case to the chemical attack in the Syrian town of khan shaykhun last year that attack led the u.s. to take military actions against Syrian government positions he claimed that Russia had called Wednesday's meeting in The Hague to make a political point former UN chemical weapons expert dr. Anton Atkins says it's strange that the UK is not providing Russia with evidence on the case there is no high percent assurance that you can determine the regions of a chemical everything that we know about a chemical comes from its composition so the chemical is never higher percent pure they come from the production at every stage reactions produce some byproducts and these byproducts can carry up to the final chemical no matter how hard you try to purify it every after every stage so by learning about those impurities you can tell what the technology was used to produce that chemical but if you have two laboratories in different countries of the world that produced the same chemical with the same technology with the same reagents you have not chance to tell exactly which sample came from which laboratory Russia follows exactly by the procedures of the convention so on the 13th of March Russia requested the UK to provide the Russia with all information and within 10 days the UK was supposed to deliver that information and the UK failed to do that so now Russia requested the Executive Council to provide the all information the next step which Russia is supposed to do right now is to make sure that the Executive Council requests that the UK provides all the information about scruples issue because the Executive Council is obliged to do that so why wouldn't the UK provide the world with the same information it's not clear and this raises much more questions to the Cabinet off from a especially - Boris Johnson and how they really established the fault of a Russian Federation in the screw past issue
