1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,170
STEVE BANNON IS NOW LOOSE AND
OUT IN THE WILD IF YOU WILL.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,730
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT ARISES
OUT OF THAT SITUATION IS, IS

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,490
THERE GOING TO BE MORE STABILITY
AT THE WHITE HOUSE NOW?

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,059
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,070
LET'S BEGIN TO ANSWER THAT IN A
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,050
FIRST, WASHINGTON POST HAS THE
STORY.

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,590
THEY EXPLAIN:

8
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,820
STEVE BANNON SAID THAT IN AN
INTERVIEW WITH THEM, SO HE

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:45,309
IS SAYING NO ADMINISTRATION HAS
EVER BEEN THIS DIVIDED.

10
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,980
STEVE BANNON IS CORRECT ABOUT
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,160
I'VE NEVER SEEN A WHITE HOUSE
THIS DIVIDED.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,469
I MEAN, OBAMA TALKED ABOUT
HAVING A TEAM OF RIVALS.

13
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:57,410
THIS IS A TEAM OF RIVALS.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,559
NO, OBAMA'S WAS INCREDIBLY CALM,
COOL, AND COLLECTED AND AS

15
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,509
MUCH AS THERE WERE FLAREUPS FROM
TIME TO TIME WITH BUSH AND

16
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:09,500
CLINTON, REAGAN, NOTHING LIKE
THIS.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,360
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MADHOUSE
OVER THERE AND IT IS PARTLY

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,470
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT AGREE.

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,060
IT IS ALSO PARTLY BECAUSE OF EGO
AND IN MY OPINION, THEY ARE

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,710
ALL BAD GUYS AND SO WHAT DO BAD
GUYS DO?

21
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,360
THEY STAB EACH OTHER IN THE
BACK.

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,880
ALL OF THAT HAS ADDED UP TO
COMPLETE CHAOS AND PLUS,

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART WHICH
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,090
MORE IN A SECOND IS NO ONE IS
HOME.

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,090
THERE IS NO BOSS.

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,860
THERE IS NO COMPETENT LEADER
THAT IS ALLOWING THEM TO DO

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,860
THIS.

28
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,330
BANNON IS RIGHT ABOUT
THE SECOND PART TOO WHICH

29
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,680
IS THAT IN THAT DIVIDED
LEADERSHIP OR DIVIDED HOUSE WITH

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,369
NO LEADERSHIP, THE ESTABLISHMENT
GUYS HAVE LARGELY WON.

31
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,960
THERE IS TALK OF BUILDING A WALL
BUT NOT MUCH AS BEEN DONE

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,290
ABOUT IT.

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,490
THE TRADE WARS THAT WERE
PROMISED TO CHINA AND OTHER

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,200
FOLKS HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED AT
ALL.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,619
INSTEAD, MORE OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT HEY, LET'S

36
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,530
KEEP EVERYTHING CALM AND COOL
AND MAKE SURE WE JUST GET

37
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,549
TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH AND WHO
CARES ABOUT THE OTHER PART OF

38
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,220
YOUR AGENDA WHICH MIGHT ACTUALLY
HURT OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS.

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,970
THAT IS OUT, THAT IS GONE.

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,520
JUST ABOUT EVERY POLICY ISSUE
YOU LOOK AT.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,420
THE POPULIST WING OF TRUMP IS
NOT WINNING.

42
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,830
YOU CAN SAY HEY, THEY ARE
WINNING ON THE WHOLE WHITE

43
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,230
NATIONALIST STUFF.

44
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,550
IF YOU CAN CALL THAT A WIN.

45
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,500
BUT OBVIOUSLY STEVE BANNON WAS
KICKED OUT PARTLY BECAUSE

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,780
OF THOSE REASONS, SO THEY ARE
NOT WINNING ON THAT ANYMORE.

47
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,560
THEY ARE A MESS.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,520
SECOND OF ALL, THAT MISUNDERSTANDS
THEIR MANDATE, WHATEVER

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,360
LITTLE MANDATE THAT THEY
HAD, WHICH WAS TO BE ñ

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,770
AND BANOON WROTE ABOUT THIS
TOO, DO ECONOMIC POPULISM.

51
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,710
DON'T GET ME WRONG, HIS POLICY
IDEAS ARE HORRIBLY WRONG AND IF

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,880
THE COUNTRY WENT IN THAT
DIRECTION, IT WOULD GREATLY

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,030
HURT THE COUNTRY BUT IN TERMS OF
POLITICS THAT IS WHAT HIS

54
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,030
BASE ELECTED HIM FOR.

55
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,960
THEY DON'T LIKE THE
ESTABLISHMENT.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,980
THEY PUT TRUMP IN OFFICE
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE WAS

57
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,580
WORKING AGAINST THE
ESTABLISHMENT.

58
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,440
IF HE WAS RUNNING
AGAINST ANOTHER POPULIST

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,080
HE MOST CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE
WON, BUT HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,470
AN INCREDIBLY ESTABLISHMENT
FIGURE AND HILLARY CLINTON.

61
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,130
THIS DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR TRUMP
ON A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

62
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:31,760
WAYS BECAUSE OF THAT.

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,610
THEY CLAIM FURTHER:

64
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,620
LOOK, TAXES ARE EASY.

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,061
THEY ALL AGREE ON GIANTS
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAX

66
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,520
CUTS FOR THE RICH.

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,220
THEY WILL DO THAT WHETHER IT IS
WITH TRUMP OR NOT.

68
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,500
THAT IS REPUBLICAN 101,
SO THAT IS THE ONE AREA THEY ARE

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,490
ALL ALIGNED ON AND THAT IS WHY I
HAVE SAID FROM DAY ONE, IF

70
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,640
THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN BANK
ON IT IS GIANT TAX CUTS FOR

71
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,240
THE RICH AND MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATIONS.

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,150
ON TRADE, THEY DO NOT AGREE SO
BANNON IS NOT LIKELY TO

73
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,060
WIN IN WHICH CASE THEY START
GETTING ANGRY AND ATTACKING

74
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,920
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

75
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,150
GOOD NEWS TO THE REST OF US.

76
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,390
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT TO
WIN ON IS, EVEN PAUL RYAN

77
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,321
HAS SAID, LOOK THESE TAX CUTS
ARE SO ENORMOUS AND IT IS

78
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:20,240
GOING TO CREATE GIANT DEFICITS.

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,230
IF YOU THOUGHT DEFICITS WERE BAD
UNDER DEMOCRATS, FIRST OF

80
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,980
ALL, THAT IS BECAUSE GEORGE W
BUSH, OBAMA GOT THE DEFICITS

81
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,570
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HE
ACTUALLY DECREASED IT BY 50%

82
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,300
BUT IF YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS BAD,
WAIT UNTIL YOU GET A LOAD

83
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,950
OF THE DEFICITS AFTER THIS TAX
CUT.

84
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,000
PAUL RYAN KNOWS THAT HE IS
LIKE AND WE ALWAYS DO AND

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,180
IMPORTATION TAX?

86
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,910
CORPORATE AMERICA WAS LIKE, NO,
YOU CAN'T.

87
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,060
THE KOCH BROTHERS LIKE NO, WE
GET A LOT OF STUFF FROM MEXICO.

88
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,530
YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO
THAT.

89
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,120
AND PAUL RYAN SAID SORRY SIR,
ABSOLUTELY.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
TAX CUTS,

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,190
NOTHING ELSE.

92
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,001
THEY WILL GET ANY OF THAT STUFF
AND HENCE, THERE WILL BE

93
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:00,640
MORE INVITING IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,850
NOW WE GO TO MATT SCHLAPP, THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN

95
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,850
CONSERVATIVE UNION.

96
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,140
THEY'RE BACKING STEVE BANNON'S
CREW HERE.

97
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:24,370
AS A CHILD, I DON'T SEE WHY
ANYONE WOULD BE STEVE BANNON.

98
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,350
HE COULD STRIP SOMEONE FROM
HIS BASE AND THAT IS A

99
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,390
LEGITIMATE CONCERN FOR THE
PRESIDENT.

100
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,390
IF YOU ARE A

101
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,780
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSPERSON THE
IDEA OF BEING AFRAID OF

102
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,180
STEVE BANNON SHOULD BE
LAUGHABLE.

103
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,740
HE IS SUCH A POLARIZING FIGURE.

104
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,640
HE IS NOTHING BUT AN ALLY FOR
YOU POLITICALLY IN THAT

105
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,180
SENSE AND YOU SHOULD ATTACK HIM
WITH 100% FEROCITY.

106
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,420
NOT SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATIC
ESTABLISHMENT IS FAMILIAR

107
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,610
WITH BUT MAN IS THIS A
SOFT TARGET.

108
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,610
IF YOU CANíT

109
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,400
HIT THIS TARGET YOU BETTER GET
OUT OF THE GAME.

110
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,320
BUT THERE WAS ONE OTHER
INTERESTING THING IN THAT QUOTE.

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,800
WHICH IS HE IS WELL-FUNDED.

112
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,270
IT DOESNíT MAKE ANY MONEY.

113
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,470
BREITBART HAS LOST 90%

114
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,430
OF ITS ADVERTISERS SINCE THIS
ADMINISTRATION BEGAN AND

115
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,320
THEIR VIEWER NUMBERS, THE READER
NUMBERS ARE IN THE TANK.

116
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
HOW ARE THEY WELL-FUNDED?

117
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,930
BECAUSE ON THE RIGHT, THEY DON'T
RUN REAL BUSINESSES.

118
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,460
IT IS JUST PROPAGANDA OUTLETS.

119
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,560
THE MERCERS, WHO ARE THE WHITE
NATIONALIST WALL STREET GUYS.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:33,061
THEY ARE A FUN COMBO OF RACIST
AND WALL STREET ABUSE, ARE

121
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,061
FUNDING BREITBART.

122
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,010
THEY ARE LIKE, WE WANT PROPAGANDA
FOR WHITE NATIONALISM AND

123
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,170
GIANT TAX CUTS AND OUR EXTREME
RIGHT WING POSITION AND

124
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,560
OBVIOUSLY, YOU LOSERS.

125
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,950
BREITBART CAN'T MAKE ANY MONEY.

126
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,260
COME ON, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
A CONSERVATIVE PUBLICATION

127
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
EVERY MADE MONEY.

128
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,360
NEW YORK POST, WEEKLY STANDARD
HAS A COMICALLY LOW

129
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,880
CIRCULATION RATE.

130
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,550
ALL THESE PUBLICATIONS ARE
DISASTERS, THEY ARE NOT

131
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,550
WINNING WITH THEM.

132
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,580
THEY ARE A MESS.

133
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,710
GUYS LIKE MERCER HAVE TO COME IN
AND PROP THEM UP.

134
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:08,180
IT IS INTERESTING THAT THERE IS
STILL THAT MONEY OUT THERE

135
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,060
FOR BREITBART TO GO NOT ONLY
CAUSE TROUBLE FOR DEMOCRATS,

136
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,870
BUT ALSO ESTABLISHMENT
REPUBLICANS AND WITH THAT WE

137
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,710
GET, AND I CAN RESPECT THAT, BUT
ALSO, FOR THEIR OWN PRESIDENT.

138
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,060
IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY, WE
ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR BALL AND

139
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,780
GO HOME AND DAMN THE TORPEDOES.

140
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,400
IT IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD
STRATEGY FOR THEM OVERALL,

141
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,139
BUT MUSIC TO MY EARS.

142
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,900
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS GOING TO
BE, THIS CONFLICT?

143
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:49,389
HERE'S ANOTHER EXCERPT FROM THE
POST.

144
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:58,170
TALK OF CRUSHING OPPOSITION IS
FAIRLY STANDARD, ESPECIALLY

145
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,020
ONLINE.

146
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,480
HAVING HIS WEAPONS BACK IN
BREITBART, OKAY, IT IS

147
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,760
RIGHT WING TALK.

148
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,200
NOT A BIG DEAL.

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,990
FOR THE REST OF US I DON'T
THINK, BUT AGAIN, IF YOU

150
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,090
ARE THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AND
YOU JUST TAKE THIS GUY ALAN

151
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,449
HE IS TALKING ABOUT GRABBING HIS
WEAPONS AND HE ALSO CALLED

152
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,850
BREITBART A KILLING MACHINE.

153
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,920
QUESTIONABLE RIGHT WING
TERMINOLOGY THERE, BUT THAT

154
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,650
IS PROBLEMATIC OF COURSE.

155
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:30,340
NOW WE GO TO A REPUBLICAN
STRATEGIST WHO SAYS:

156
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:38,690
THAT MEANS YEAH, YOU MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN RID OF BANNON AND

157
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,020
PRIEBUS AND SEAN SPICER AND
SCARAMUCCI, BUT THEY ARE

158
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,000
NOT THE ONES WHO ARE CAUSING THE
PROBLEM.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,260
THEY ARE A SYMPTOM OF THE
PROBLEM.

160
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,510
THE PROBLEM IS DONALD TRUMP.

161
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,920
THE GUY IS A TOTAL CLOWN.

162
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:04,890
END OF THE WASHINGTON POST OR A
HERE SAYS:

163
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,600
THERE IS NO EVIDENT STRATEGY
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS IN

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,500
CHARGE.

165
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,660
YOU CAN HAVE STEVE BANNON GO
AND IT MIGHT BE IMMEDIATELY

166
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,890
HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU RESTORE
SOME DEGREE OF ORDER IN THE

167
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,800
WHITE HOUSE, LONG-TERM, IT MAY
BE DAMAGING BECAUSE HE IS GOING

168
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,940
TO FIRE ALL OF HIS CANNONS ON
YOU APPARENTLY AT SOME POINT BUT

169
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,260
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT ISN'T
GOING TO HELP ANYTHING BECAUSE

170
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,100
THE SOURCE OF THE INSTABILITY
WAS NOT STEVE BANNON.

171
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,540
THE SOURCE OF SOME OF THE HATRED
AND THE WHITE NATIONALISM

172
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,100
MIGHT'VE BEEN BANNON, BUT THE
SOURCE OF THE INSTABILITY IS THE

173
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,470
PRESIDENT HIMSELF SO THE END OF
THE DAY, YOU HAVE SOLVED NOTHING

174
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,160
AND PROBABLY CREATED MORE
HEADACHES FOR YOURSELF NOW

175
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,820
THAT YOU ARE IN SOME WAYS GOING
TO WAR WITH YOUR BASE.

176
00:09:46,820 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT SHOULD BE FUN.
