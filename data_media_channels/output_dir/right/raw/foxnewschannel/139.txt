66
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,260
IT WANTS TO MAKE MONEY AND TAX

67

203
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,978
TO USE MARIJUANA ON THE STREETS.

204
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,013

COPS, I JUST TALKED ABOUT IT.

209
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:37,754
THAT'S BETTER THAN LEGALIZING

210
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:38,021
IT.

211
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:39,255
THE ONLY THING THAT WILL DO IS

212
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,858
MAKE IT MORE COMMON.

213
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,193

00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:02,479
SELLING IT.

00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,087
DON'T GIVE IN OUR PERSONAL

233
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:11,554
FREEDOM GARBAGE.

234
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,556
IF THIS IS CORPORATION.

235
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:18,228
>> DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE --

236
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:18,962
TO THINK ANHEUSER-BUSCH IS AN

00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,130
EVIL CORPORATION AND THAT THEY

238
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:21,631
ARE JUST OUT THERE TO DESTROY

239
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,134

00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:25,568
WORLD.

242
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,637
>> DO THINK THAT ALCOHOL SHOULD

243
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,005
BE ILLEGAL AND THAT THESE

244
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,673
COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE THERE TO

245
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:33,643
PROVIDE A PRODUCT?

246
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,011
>> Tucker: A PRODUCT, IT'S

247
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,279
