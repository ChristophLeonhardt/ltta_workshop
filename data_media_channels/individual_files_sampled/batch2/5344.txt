after all the guilty pleas and charges today is an unusual point in modern American history the campaign chair for a sitting president facing trial for crimes that could give him life in prison Muller's prosecutors throwing the book at Paul Manafort today and that's a bad Association for any White House a trial like this though prosecutors do say they do not expect Russia to come up meaning this trial is not expected to breakthrough answers on collusion and that actually makes it quite odd that this is the week that Trump and his allies are bringing up collusion not to say it never happened but to claim as we've been reporting tonight that it's may be okay even if it did the argument is that collusion is not a crime so even if more evidence comes out about it that's okay they also argue that those rookies in that meeting didn't know better which doesn't really apply to a veteran operative like Paul manna for now colluding with foreigners to impact a u.s. election is a crime let's go through it briefly one it's a crime to get anything of value from foreigners - it's a crime to defraud the United States three it's a crime to steal things whether you steal objects like everything that was ripped off in Watergate or you steal email which is what is it is shoe and molars latest indictment and finally four it's a crime to engage in a conspiracy of any of those other crimes so collusion is not only a crime collusion involves at least four crimes those are the legal facts now in fairness we will note here as we have many times on this program no American has been charged with any of those potential crimes I just mentioned in fact Bob Miller may never charge any Americans so that could be a good thing if you were rooting for this White House to escape any collusion culpability but these are crimes they do exist and that's what makes it's so odd to watch the Trump teams evolving defense collusion is not a crime and so the fact of the matter is that we're a long way away yet from having anything to talk about here collusion is not a crime only in antitrust law you conclude all you want with for government in an election there's no such statute but what crime right identify the crop there's no evidence by the way of colluded with the Russians it's not a crime collusion is not a crime well there's not any evidence of any collusion here involving our client that drum beat of course that's committed this week with rudy giuliani's interviews and a presidential tweet today they never used it that's the main thing never use if they rejected it there was collusion with the Russians they would have used it I've been sitting here looking in the federal code trying to find collusion as a crime not even know if that's a crime colluding about Russians I'm joined by former federal prosecutors John Flannery and Seth Waxman and Tasha Bertrand back with me as well John take it away well these guys sure shouldn't be teaching first-year law criminal law there's also not in the the code you won't find colluding with Russians either but the definition that we're concerned about is when two or more persons commit agree to commit a crime that is the crime of conspiracy and if you are considering the fact of what collusion is again it's two or more persons agreeing to commit a crime so you can't subtract the crime the object of the agreement and say well collusion is not a crime and I suppose what they're saying is the technical word collusion they can't find it in the code but the elements of a crime is how we define it in Section 371 yeah it's a collusion it that way it's a collusion conspiracy correct yes yeah and and and interestingly if you just take the June 9th meeting you may have the pre meeting that Rudy doesn't know happened or not you talked about the sushi dinner no sushi dinner yes sure and then we have it on June 8th the Russians put the stolen emails and another information from the DNC and the d-triple-c online and the next day they're at the tower and we're to believe that they talked about adopting Russian children rather than what the email said that put together the meeting that said Russia likes Trump for president and we want to help you and they have a and afterwards we see that they do it right let me go to Seth on the under stolen property piece if material was stolen and just went around the world on the Internet and that's the end of it and you can make the argument that that just happened right the problem is that in their defenses they seem to be getting closer to the idea and I want to be very fair here it's not alleged that they personally receive the stolen material yet but if they did receiving stolen material depending on how you do it or what you do with it can be criminal and there are precedents which is what we lawyers tend to look to Seth I want to reach back into the vault for this fantastically interesting corollary where when the gore campaign received material that was helpful to it but they were concerned it might be stolen on Bush they immediately called the FBI take a look somebody had stolen it evidently from the Bush campaign and mailed it to my close friend Tom Downey who was going to be Bush the bush stand-in and debate prep right it didn't it wasn't mailed from ask it but it was mail from Texas we immediately turn it over the FBI and Tom recused himself Seth how does that figure into the analysis sure I mean that can be aiding and abetting or an accessory after the fact someone commits a crime hacking into computers and then shares that information with you knowingly and you make use of it that can be an aiding and abetting crime or an accessory after the fact that under the criminal statutes and penalties you as an aider and abettor are as criminally responsible as the principal who conducted or committed the act at first and you offer up for four crimes at the outset of your piece there I'll offer up another one that you and I have talked about before is federal bribery I've been I've been jumping up and down for months as you know writing op-eds and tweeting out that federal bribery statute a 15 year offense criminalizes of this for that exchange so if they gave dirt on Hillary in exchange for a promise to lift or reduce sanctions on Russians that is a classic quid pro quo and as you and I have talked about in the past because that bribery statute has that unique language that makes it applicable both to people who have been sworn into office and candidates it puts it right into the wheelhouse at this time of the Trump Tower meeting and otherwise and that hammer of a 15 year penalty is far greater than conspiracies to defraud the United States or election campaign finance violations and that's the kind of hammer federal bribery and it can be a predicate for Rico and honest services fraud even 20-year offenses that's the kind of crime federal prosecutors used to flip senior members who we used to call chief lieutenants of a criminal conspiracy Seth Waxman citing the term of art in federal precedent for when the bribery liability attaches to a nominee might have been a more impressive legal point than anything you've said John I don't want to pick you guys against each other on the wider ambit of this the prosecutors are laying out in more than four examples why collusion conspiracies are criminal walk us through your analysis of the wider politics of this why are we hearing about this as the Manafort trial begins what it kind of tell do you see it as right so what's interesting about this talking point is that it actually emerged in the Media kind of around the time that Jim Comey was fired as FBI director so it seems to emerge anytime there's kind of a crisis going on with regard to the president's position within the Russia investigation so now we see it emerging just after this revelation that Michael Cohen is willing to testify to prosecutors that you know Trump not only knew about the Trump Tower meeting but actually approved it and of course days before the man afford hearing which is not going to focus on collusion it's not going to focus on Russia we saw today in the opening statements it really didn't have anything to do with that it has to do with bank fraud tax fraud etc but still there has to be a nervousness there because of course looming over the entire trial is the fact that Paul Manafort is at the center of questions about whether the campaign did conspire is a better word than collude with the Russians during the elections so this is not a new talking point it's been out there it seems to kind of you know resurface every time the White House seemed is really scared about something but it's definitely one that is a conscious effort to shake the goalposts here John did you ever see there will be blood the movie no I did there's a great scene in there where he keeps screaming I drink your milkshake and that's sort of what Seth feels he's done to you legally in the in a second give you a final a final word if if Seth was indeed the more arcane legal analyst tonight I'm not taking sides well in the case of bribery you know it takes only two to tango and therefore it's not treated the same way as conspiracy because necessary to of bribery is that there be at least two people but the thing that's interesting to me about a conspiracy is you don't actually have to achieve the object of the conspiracy if they had the meeting and they had these conversations to advance the conspiracy that is to do a quid pro quo with Russia they're stuck even if they didn't do anything after that now I believe that they have and your question is will we ever find out that any person or persons is involved in this and I think you can take that to the bank we don't know the time but your point about how many people involved goes to how hard it is to prove the case anyone watching at home wondering what law schools like it'd be like if this segment lasted three years and who wants that my special thanks to all of our great experts tonight hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can
