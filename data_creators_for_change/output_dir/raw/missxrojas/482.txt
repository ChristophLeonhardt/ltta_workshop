and it's like wake up everyone come on

24

25
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,640
because that's what I do that snow

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,199
started falling properly at about

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,659
midnight last night naturally I ran out

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,729

29

31
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,720
my face<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes you ready when towards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,030
episode of your girls where Lorelei for

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,299
smelters their teens now feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> such</font>

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,640
a destroyer of slow because this snow<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,220
perfect it's light and fluffy I mean

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,710
it's not the best snow for the stables

37
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,030
right now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still a little bit too</font>

38
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,340
fluffy for that and I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compact</font>

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,630
them and make it into stable earlier and

40
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,060
that just didn't happen and it's perfect

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,979
for everything else and then you come

42
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,540
across the treacherous bits of ice also

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it really bad but I when I see this</font>

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,590
lake covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ice what a I think of</font>

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,880
hiring butter and beat I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,220
skate over it or like touch it but even

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,320
though I know that it would kind of kill

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,070
me with how cold it is I just brought

49
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,479
some ice just<font color="#CCCCCC"> stabbed the ice</font>

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,020
when you step in someone else's

51
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,440
footsteps everything will crack I'm sure

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,540
there's a nice literary point there to

53
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,060
be made but I'll leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to a</font>

54
