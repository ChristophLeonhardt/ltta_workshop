1
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:04,389
HARVEY WEINSTEIN MADE

2
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:07,509
HIS PERP WALK INTO THE
COURTHOUSE TO POST A

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,290
MILLION-DOLLAR BAIL WHICH HE
ESSENTIALLY JUST DROPPED ON THE

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,040
TABLE AND WALKED OUT.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,719
HARVEY
WEINSTEIN IS A CONSEQUENCE OF

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,570
THIS MORNING ACTIVITIES WILL BE
FITTED WITH A GPS DEVICE BECAUSE

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,949
HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH RAPE
AND HE CANNOT LEAVE THE AREA OF

8
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:33,960
NEW YORK OR CONNECTICUT.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,210
HERE IS HOW IT WAS DESCRIBED,
THE VIDEO THAT WE HAVE BY

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,230
THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:45,019
THE CHARGES HERE TODAY ARE A
RESULT OF MONTHS OF

12
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:49,829
INVESTIGATION AND THAT
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THIS

13
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,500
DEFENDANT USED HIS POSITION,
MONEY, AND POWER TO THE WERE

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,324
YOUNG WOMEN INTO SITUATIONS WHEN
HE WAS ABLE TO VIOLATE THEM

15
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:01,324
SEXUALLY.

16
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:03,239
OUR INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING AND
WE HAVE ENCOURAGED OTHER

17
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,959
SURVIVORS TO COME FORWARD.

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,060
THAT LITTLE REACTION THAT HE
HAD WHEN HE HEARD VIOLATE

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,070
THEM SEXUALLY, IT WAS THIS WEIRD
LITTLE DISMISSIVE, WHEN YOU

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,729
MAKE OF THAT MOMENT?

21
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,920
I THINK HE WAS JUST HAVING A
FLASHBACK THE POTTED PLANTS.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,210
THEY GOT ME.

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,229
HIS LAWYER MADE SOME
STATEMENTS, WHICH WE PULLED

24
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,310
VIDEO OF.

25
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,990
HERE IS HIS LAWYER
BENJAMIN BRAFFMEN.

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,990
HIS FIRST

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,240
STATEMENT WAS ABOUT HINTING AT
WHETHER THE JURY WILL

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,049
BELIEVE THIS AND WHETHER THEY
CAN FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF

29
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,659
JURY IN HIS MIND AT ALL.

30
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,659
TAKE A LOOK.

31
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,450
MANY OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE
LONG OVERDUE QUITE FRANKLY

32
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,090
HAVING BEEN MADE ABOUT EVENTS
THAT ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE

33
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,750
OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.

34
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,689
THEY
WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE POLICE

35
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:48,899
AT THE TIME.

36
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,450
THESE EVENTS
OCCURRED AND I ANTICIPATE THAT

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,250
THE WOMEN WHO HAVE MADE THESE
ALLEGATIONS WHEN SUBJECTED TO

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,280
CROSS-EXAMINATION IN THE EVENTS
WE EVEN GET THAT FAR, THAT

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,200
THE CHARGES WILL NOT
BE BELIEVED BY 12

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,050
PEOPLE, ASSUMING WE GET 12
FAIR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CONSUMED

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,039
BY THE MOVEMENT THAT SEEMS TO
HAVE OVERTAKEN THIS CASE.

42
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,620
SO THE MOVEMENT THAT SEEMS TO
HAVE OVERTAKEN THIS CASE.

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,130
ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT
HIM AS BEETLEJUICE,

44
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,130
BEETLEJUICE, BEETLEJUICE.

45
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,990
I HOPE HE DISAPPEARS.

46
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,290
WHAT IS IT WITH THE OLD-SCHOOL
NEW YORK GUYS AND THE HAIR?

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,580
TRUMPS DOCTOR, WEINSTEIN'S
LAWYER.

48
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,690
ANYWAY, SOME POTENTIAL

49
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,690
BAD NEWS HERE.

50
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,680
I READ A FAIRLY
PERSUASIVE ARTICLE

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,680
ON LAW AND CRIME ABOUT
HOW HE MIGHT GET AWAY.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,310
OF

53
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,050
COURSE THERE IS 1 MILLION THINGS
THAT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW

54
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,849
AND THEN BUT OUR JOB IS TO
ANALYZE RIGHT?

55
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,300
FIRST OF ALL, LET'S ALSO NOTE A
TERRIBLE THING THAT THE LAWYER

56
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
SAID.

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,770
HE SAID HARVEY WEINSTEIN
DIDN'T INVENTS THE CASTING COUCH

58
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,300
DOTS IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC
OPINION, THAT IS ABOUT A BADDEST

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,300
THING YOU CAN SAY.

60
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,120
WHAT'S THE
BIG, EVERYBODY WAS RAPING WOMEN

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,110
WHO ARE COMING IN.

62
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,930
BUT IN THE
ACTUAL COURT, THAT MIGHT NOT BE

63
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,549
AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS TO US, SO HE
IS GOING TO SAY SINCE IT WAS

64
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,580
SUCH AN INDUSTRY-STANDARD THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP FOR A

65
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,629
JOB, IT MIGHT'VE BEEN THAT THE
WOMEN ASSUMED THAT THEY WERE

66
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,900
PART OF THAT PROCESS HENCE IT
WAS NOT ONLY AGAINST THEIR WILL,

67
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,720
THAT IN HOLLYWOOD, YOU MUST
SLEEPER A JOB AND THEY ARE

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,330
CHOOSING TO DO THAT.

69
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,650
THAT IS
GOING TO BE PART OF HIS CASE.

70
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,900
IT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO PROVE
WHAT WAS IN PEOPLE'S HEADS.

71
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,900
A

72
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,730
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS
CASE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,840
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, THEY
COULD NOT CHARGE HARVEY

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,500
WEINSTEIN WITH LOWER CRIMES.

75
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
THEY HAD TO CHARGE THEM WITH

76
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,110
FIRST-DEGREE RAPE AND
FIRST-DEGREE SEXUAL ASSAULT

77
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,379
BECAUSE THE LOWER CRIMES,
ESPECIALLY FOR THE 2004 CASE ARE

78
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:03,329
TOO OLD BUT THE GOOD NEWS IN NEW
YORK IS THAT THERE IS NO STATUTE

79
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:05,939
OF LIMITATIONS ON RAPE IN THE
1STâˆž.

80
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,309
THE BAD NEWS IS YOU HAVE

81
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:11,910
TO PROVE THE HIGHEST CHARGE
POSSIBLE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE

82
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,779
OF THE CASES THEY SAY THE WOMAN
FELL INTIMIDATED AND THREATENS,

83
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:22,380
BUT IN NEW YORK LAW, IN ORDER TO
PROVE FIRST-DEGREE AND THIS IS

84
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,230
WHERE IT GETS TRICKY AND THAT'S
WHAT THE LAWYERS WILL GO TO WORK

85
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:31,310
ON THE JURY, A THREAT OF
ACTUAL FORCE, WAS FORCED

86
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,060
THREATENED, WAS FORCE USED?

87
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,080
AND THERE'S EVEN ANOTHER
LOOPHOLE, AND ONE OF THESE

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,610
CHARGES IS SAYS SEX, WHICH IS
INTERPRETED IN OLDER CASE LAW AS

89
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,220
INTERCOURSE AND NOT NECESSARILY
ORAL SEX AND THE 2004 CASE WAS

90
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,730
ORAL SEX SO HE HAS A STREAM TEAM
BECAUSE HE HAS ALL OF THE MONEY

91
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,510
IN THE WORLD, THIS IS ONE OF THE
TOP LAWYERS THERE IS IN THIS

92
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,920
FIELD AND HE IS GOING TO UNLEASH
THEM SO DON'T BE SURPRISED

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,860
IF AT THE END, HE IS NOT
CONVICTED.

94
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,420
I THINK HE MAKES A POINT
THOUGH, I'M NOT TRYING TO EXCUSE

95
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,580
HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S BEHAVIOR BUT
I THINK THAT THIS IS A REAL

96
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,530
SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND I THINK THAT
HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS ONE OF THE

97
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,920
SYMPTOMS OF AN ISSUE THAT WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT BILL COSBY AND

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,340
ALL OF THE MEN WHO ARE NOW GOING
DOWN WHO ARE NO LONGER OF VALUE

99
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,110
TO HOLLYWOOD ANYMORE BUT WHILE
THEY WERE IN THEIR HEYDAY IN ALL

100
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,610
OF THIS STUFF WAS GOING ON THEY
WERE BEING ENABLED, A LOT OF

101
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,250
PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW
THEY KNEW THAT THESE GUYS WERE

102
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,690
DOING THIS AND NO ONE SAID
ANYTHING AND I THINK THAT WE

103
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,120
REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE
DEEPER PROBLEM WHICH IS NOT JUST

104
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,870
HARVEY WEINSTEIN, BUT THERE IS A
COLLECTION OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE

105
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,380
THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS ACCEPTABLE
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WATCH

106
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,020
IT HAPPEN.

107
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,840
THIS BIG SPORTS
AGENT, VERY BIG-TIME, I WAS

108
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,560
SITTING AT DINNER WITH MY
FRIENDS HE WALKED BY ME WITHOUT

109
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,350
KNOWING ME AND RAN HIS HANDS
THROUGH MY HAIR AND I WENT OFF

110
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,880
ON HIM BUT WHAT MADE ME SO ANGRY
WAS THAT I WAS SITTING WITH TWO

111
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
MEN, ONE WHO WORK AT NIKE AND
ONE WHO WAS A SPORTS AGENT AND

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,480
THEY LEFT IT OFF, THEY DIDN'T
THINK THAT THAT WAS INVASIVE,

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,160
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
DISRESPECTFUL, THEY TOLD ME TO

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,210
JUST SIMMER DOWN AND I AM LIKE
A LETTER STRANGE MEN WALK

115
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,210
AROUND AND CARESS YOUR HAIR.

116
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,570
YOU WOULD GET UP AND PROBABLY
TRY TO FIGHT HIM.

117
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,060
IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY
TIME THAT HAPPENED.

118
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,750
IT WAS JUST WEIRD.

119
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,870
I WAS
LISTENING TO QUINN AND PALTROW

120
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,780
TALK ABOUT HOW BRAD PITT I WILL
KILL YOU BUT THEN HE WENT ON TO

121
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,960
DO AND GLORIOUS PASTORS WITH
THEM AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM IS

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,510
THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU SLEPT
SOMEBODY ON THE WRIST AND SAY

123
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,830
THAT IS NOT OKAY BUT THEY ARE
STILL IN BUSINESS, THEY ARE

124
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,910
STILL MAKING MONEY AND IT IS
STILL NOT OKAY.

125
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,210
I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER
THINGS HEARS POWER AND

126
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,600
PRIVILEGE.

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,370
HERE HE IS, AS YOU
SAY HAS HIGH-POWERED ATTORNEYS,

128
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,510
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE ABLE TO
ADVOCATE FOR HIM AND NOW HE GETS

129
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,340
OFF, HE IS ABLE TO POST THAT
MILLION DOLLAR BILL, NOT MANY

130
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,330
PEOPLE CAN DO THAT.

131
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,350
HUMANS
RIGHTS WATCH, THERE WAS SOME

132
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,620
RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE AND THEY
EXAMINED LIKE SIX COUNTRIES IN

133
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,160
70 TO 80% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
ARRESTED ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY SO

134
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,110
THEY ARE SITTING IN JAIL AND IN
CALIFORNIA ALONE, NEARLY 60% OF

135
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,310
PRISONERS IN THE COUNTY JAILS
HAVE NOT BEEN SENTENCED BUT THEY

136
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,580
ARE SERVING BECAUSE THEY CAN
POST BAIL SO THAT IS THE OTHER

137
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,050
PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AS WELL,
IS THE POWER AND THE PRIVILEGE

138
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,170
AND WHO HE IS.

139
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,370
WE WERE TALKING
BEFORE WE CAME ON ABOUT HOW HE

140
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,730
WAS IN FIRST CLASS,

141
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,730
MELVIN, GREAT POINT.

142
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:41,790
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING WHEN I
SAW THE MILLION DOLLAR CASH ALE.

143
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,540
HE FINDS THAT IN BETWEEN HIS
COUCH, RIGHT?

144
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,210
WHAT IS THE POINT OF BAILED AND?

145
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,940
THE POINT IS UNFORTUNATELY TO
KEEP POOR PEOPLE IN JAIL AND SO

146
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,220
THERE ARE NOW SOME DISTRICT
ATTORNEYS WHO ARE OVERTURNING

147
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,330
THAT LIKE LARRY KRASNER IN
PHILADELPHIA, WE'RE NOT DOING

148
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,400
CASH SPELL ANYMORE BECAUSE RICH
PEOPLE AND EVEN MIDDLE-CLASS

149
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,920
PEOPLE CAN PAY AND POOR PEOPLE
CAN'T. IT'S NOT BASED ON THE

150
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,690
SEVERITY OF THE CRIME AS IT IS
ON YOUR INCOME LEVEL SO CASH

151
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,860
BAIL IS JUST A WAY TO PUT FOUR
PEOPLE IN PRISON DOTS WE DON'T

152
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,330
EVEN KNOW THAT THEY DID A LOT
OF TIMES IT IS MINOR INFRACTIONS

153
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,860
OR MARIJUANA CHARGES.

154
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,340
MEANWHILE
A GUY WHO APPEARS TO BE AS

155
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,410
SERIAL RAPIST, ALLEGEDLY, WHAT'S
RUN FREE AS HE COULD BE BECAUSE

156
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,200
IT'S $1 MILLION THAT HE HAS
EASILY.

157
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
BUT THAT THEN LED ME TO

158
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,360
THINKING LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IN

159
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,260
THIS CASE AND IT IS GOING TO BE
TOUGH BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE BIT

160
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,849
OLDER AND HE HAS GREAT ATTORNEYS
AND ONE OF THE KEY PARTS OF THE

161
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,559
CASES, WHETHER THE JUDGE WILL
ALLOW THE OTHER INSTANCES OF

162
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,990
WHEN WOMEN CAME FORWARD AND
TALKED ABOUT WHAT HARVEY

163
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,210
WEINSTEIN DID AND SO FROM TIME
TO TIME I TELL YOU GUYS THAT I

164
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,020
USED TO BE A REPUBLICAN AND THE
ONLY PART THAT IS LEFT THAT IS

165
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,770
STILL CONSERVATIVE IS THE LEGAL
PART, SO IT DRIVES ME CRAZY WHEN

166
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,500
YOU CANNOT INTRODUCE EVIDENCE OF
THEIR PATTERN IN COURT.

167
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
IT

168
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
PREVENTS JUSTICE.

169
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,570
IT IS NOT THAT
YOU CAN'T EVER DO IT,

170
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,990
BUT IT IS TOUGH STANDARDS FOR
WHEN YOU CAN DO AND I KNOW WHY.

171
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,160
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE JUDGING
THEM BASED ON OTHER STUFF,

172
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,560
YOU WANT THEM JUDGING IT ON THIS
CRIME BUT IF THAT GUY HAS A

173
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
PATTERN OF DOING IT 50

174
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,390
TIMES, IS THAT RELEVANT TO
WHETHER HE DID IN THIS CASE?

175
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,020
OF COURSE IT'S RELEVANT.

176
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,960
IF
THEY NEVER HEAR THAT, HERE IS A

177
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,240
WAY BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING
OFF.

178
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,880
IF THEY DO HERE HE MIGHT BE

179
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,810
IN TROUBLE THE MATTER HOW GOOD
HIS LAWYERS ARE.

180
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,810
I WOULD

181
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,390
SAY HIS LAWYER IS GOING EVEN
FURTHER THAN THAT, HE IS SETTING

182
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,670
UP THE ARGUMENT THAT EVEN IF
THEY DON'T ADMIT THAT KIND OF

183
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,911
EVIDENCE, AS THAT VIDEO WE SAID
PROVES, HE IS SETTING UP, THERE

184
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,390
IS NO ONE IN AMERICA WHO HAS
BEEN INSULATED FROM THE BIAS, IS

185
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,870
WHAT HE IS GOING TO ARGUE, THE
BIAS TOWARD MY CLIENTS OF THESE

186
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,460
RIDICULOUS, SPURIOUS CHARGES
THAT DO NOT MEAN ANYTHING AND HE

187
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,690
IS GOING, HE IS MOVING TO
DISMISS IMMEDIATELY ACCORDING TO

188
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,890
HIM, BUT HE IS SETTING UP THAT
WE CANNOT EVEN 512 PEOPLE WHO

189
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,480
ARE GOING TO COME IN WITH FRESH
EARS, EVEN IF WE DON'T LET THAT

190
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
EVIDENCE IN.

191
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,360
IT IS SUPER FRUSTRATING AND HE
IS ALSO KINDA SETTING IT UP

192
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,080
AS TO HOW UNFAIR IT IS TO HIS
CLIENT.

193
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,740
WASN'T IT BLOOMBERG WHO SAID
HE WOULDN'T SPEAK ILL OF HARVEY

194
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,260
BECAUSE HE IS A NEW YORKER.

195
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,140
THAT'S THE THING?

196
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,550
I HAVE TO SUPPORT EVERYONE IN
LOS ANGELES?

197
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,630
ALL THEY DO IS SPEAK ILL OF
NEW YORKERS.

198
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,690
HAVE YOU EVER LIVED IN NEW
YORK?

199
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,910
BUT TO SAY THAT HE IS NOT
GOING TO GET TREATED FAIRLY IN

200
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,460
NEW YORK, THAT IS THE OPINION OF
A VERY SUCCESSFUL, RICH, WHITE

201
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,040
MAN IN NEW YORK IT WAS LIKE, I
CAN'T THROW HARVEY UNDER THE BUS

202
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,600
FOR THE RAPE THAT HE DID DO
BECAUSE HE IS A NEW YORKER.

203
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,210
IN THE WHOLE IDEA THAT THE
JURY CANNOT JUDGE THE CASE

204
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,770
FAIRLY IF THEY HAVE EVER HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, I ALSO

205
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,020
DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT ALL.

206
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,660
THEY ARE GOING TO SPEND MONTHS
IN THERE AND THEY ARE GOING

207
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,540
TO HEAR ALL OF THE EVIDENCE SO
IF WE DON'T THINK THAT THEY

208
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,440
COULD BE UNBIASED, THEN LET'S
NOT HAVE JURY TRIALS.

209
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,530
AND IS IT UNFAIR, THIS IS ALL
UNFAIR TO HARVEY.

210
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,530
YOU HAVE DONE

211
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,560
THIS AND DOZENS OF WOMEN HAVE
ACCUSED YOU OF THIS.

212
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
YOU HAVE

213
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,310
GOTTEN OFF SCOT-FREE FOR YEARS
WITH OSCARS IN YOUR POCKET IN A

214
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:25,350
CITY WHERE EVERYBODY KNEW, BRAD
PITT KNEW YOU WERE DOING THIS.

215
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,330
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN
FAIR TO YOU FOR THE LAST 20

216
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,330
YEARS.

217
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,580
YOU HAVE WHAT IS IT LIKE 80
WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD AND

218
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,200
THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES
WHO HAVE COME FORWARD.

219
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,510
IMAGINE THE COURAGE AND THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT COME

220
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,530
FORWARD OR DISCLOSED.

221
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,380
THAT IS THE OTHER THING AND
STILL THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO

222
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,410
BE ENOUGH, AND STILL THIS MAN IS
ABLE TO WALK THE STREETS

223
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,730
BECAUSE HE HAS ACCESS.

224
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,300
HE IS SMILING IN THIS
PICTURE.

225
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,770
LAST THING ON IT IS, IF THEY
GET THEM, THEY GOT THEM, GREAT.

226
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,770
WONDERFUL.

227
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,880
IF THEY DON'T GET
HIM, THEIR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS

228
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,510
IN MANHATTAN WHO ARE ALSO
LOOKING INTO THIS AND I WOULD

229
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,750
SAY KEEP GOING, BROTHERS AND
SISTERS AND ONES IN LA, THEY

230
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,470
SHOULD LOOK INTO IT TO BECAUSE
YOU JUST KEEP TRYING HIM AND

231
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,380
TELL AT LEAST YOU BANKRUPT THEM.

232
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,890
BY THE WAY, DON'T GET ME WRONG,

233
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,300
DOUBLE JEOPARDY IN THIS COUNTRY
AND RIGHTFULLY SO, IT IS IN THE

234
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,060
U.S. CONSTITUTION, YOU CAN'T
KEEP TRYING HIM IN THE SAME

235
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,840
VENUE FOR THE SAME CRIME, I AM
NOT SUGGESTING THAT.

236
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,980
THERE ARE 80 CASES HERE, YOU
ARE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF

237
00:12:25,980 --> 00:00:00,000
VICTIMS UNFORTUNATELY.
