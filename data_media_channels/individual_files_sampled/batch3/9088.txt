♪ ♪ ♪ WELCOME BACK TO THE NEXT REVOLUTION. I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ABOUT HIS LIFE STORY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR STORY A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU THAT PEOPLE LOVE IS THAT YOU ARE PROBABLY THE BIGGEST, SINGLE IMMIGRATION SUCCESS STORY THAT'S EVER BEEN. IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED SINCE YOU'VE COME HERE. ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE DON'T CALL ME A SELF-MADE MAN BECAUSE OF IT WOULD'VE BEEN FOR AMERICA, IF IT WOULD NOT BEEN FOR THE ENDLESS AMOUNT OF NOTHING. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REALLY THANK AMERICA AND THEN TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK AND THIS IS WHERE THIS COMES IN. MY NEED FOR HELPING SPECIAL OLYMPICS IN THE 70s AND BECOMING THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRAINER OF SPECIAL OLYMPICS WERE WORKING WITH AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS AND PROMOTING FITNESS AND BEING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PRESIDENTS COUNCIL ON FITNESS AND TRAVELING TO ALL 50 STATES BUT I WAS TRYING TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK BECAUSE I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO SAY THANK YOU TO AMERICA AND EVENTUALLY THAT LED TO MY NEED FOR THE RECALL IN CALIFORNIA THAT JUMPING TO THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. I TOTALLY SHARE THAT FEELING. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL. I FEEL THE SAME WAY. ALONG THE WAY, YOU MET RONALD REAGAN. TELL US ABOUT THAT. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOUR IMPRESSIONS WERE AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO WORK WITH HIM. THE FIRST TIME WAS AT A PARTY IN THE LATE 70s. IT WAS JUST BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT. THEN LATER ON I MET HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I WAS INVITED TO SEVERAL STATE DINNERS AND I BROUGHT MY MOTHER THERE, I TOLD HIM I SAID MY MOTHER IS CRAZY ABOUT THE USA. ANYWAY, I WAS INVITED TO THE STATE DINNER AND MY MOTHER HAPPEN TO BE HERE AT THE TIME, SHE WAS CAME EVERY SPRING FOR MOTHER'S DAY OVER HERE AND I TOOK HER TO THE WHITE HOUSE, IT WAS FANTASTIC. REAGAN WAS A SCHMOOZE HER. HE LOVED TO HOLD COURT, DOESN'T MATTER IF THERE WAS DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, AND MADE NO DIFFERENT.
