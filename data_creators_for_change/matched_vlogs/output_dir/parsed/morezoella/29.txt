where the day takes us but it is
actually beauty of wind I was expecting
the wind it is brighter though so I
guess that can't be helped you know it's
like 25 degrees in London right now
yeah because well because they don't get
wind so it's just
muggy heat London's like humid I don't
like that yeah that's what I mean
just hot humid in Brighton I thought I
could not leave Brighton without meeting
up with so and I'm a massive massive fan
of her and I've invited her to come on
the carousel with me because it's my
favorite thing in the world okay back in
