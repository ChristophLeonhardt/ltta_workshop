00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so only this week</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I went to</font>

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">a preview screening of divergent you may</font>

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of that film kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,560
it's based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first book in a</font>

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,780
trilogy by Veronica Roth and it starts

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,670
the one miraculous shailene woodley at

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,710
the screening they gave me free wine yes

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,560
popcorn yes and the spinny thing which

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,420
tells you all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different factions and</font>

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,160
definitions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the factions in the city</font>

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,230
in divergent you might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,519
from this well you probably already know

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
the divergent is set in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago of</font>

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,269
the future it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dystopian Chicago but</font>

15
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,470
the alarming thing to me was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,210
wasn't all dark and that's kind of a

17
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,890
common theme<font color="#CCCCCC"> of disturbing films so few</font>

18
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,690
feels very dark kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very great</font>

19
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,910
lighting in tone this didn't quite going

20
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to same route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of bright</font>

21
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,750
colors of blue skies and sharp edges and

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,850
all of those things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem slightly</font>

23
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,410
more ordered even though it's within a

24
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,760
crumbling<font color="#CCCCCC"> City you very much like the</font>

25
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,559
idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a city being rebuilt</font>

26
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,390
within a crumbling city and yet there's

27
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,160
a lot there that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time decay at</font>

28
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,510
first the newness of it will definitely

29
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">an avenue but the soundtrack which</font>

30
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,960
includes songs by Ellie Goulding I kind

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of just went and embraced that and that</font>

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,050
really pulled me through the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

33
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,510
film and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amy embraces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

34
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,969
really fun foam is go exploring her new

35
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,188
faction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to terms with a</font>

36
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,100
different group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding a</font>

37
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,540
outlandishness in herself that she

38
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,979
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that she had in it</font>

39
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,810
and a daring within herself as well I

40
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,460
guess and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was certainly reflected</font>

41
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,810
in the film also mentioned shailene

42
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,070
woodley<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that she's absolutely</font>

43
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,869
tremendous in this in all the films<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

44
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,490
seen from her<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's characters all very</font>

45
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,900
different which has this quiet power

46
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">they just transcends through all her</font>

47
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,740
roles in its<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really something else's</font>

48
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,530
it's truly magnificent and then there's

49
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,590
Theo James is just beautiful I very much

50
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,570
lived up to my ideals of fall those

51
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,710
feelings weren't quite maintained

52
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,329
through a second third book but yeah the

53
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,030
first one wow what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gorgeous gorgeous</font>

54
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,670
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway onwards I'm really</font>

55
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested to hear your thoughts on a</font>

56
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,950
they did make some interesting choices

57
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,570
when it comes to pasting I think the

58
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,340
narrative sort of jumped around a little

59
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,899
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it needed to I was if</font>

60
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:49,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">although there were some things that</font>

61
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,540
were pushed in the film will felt a bit

62
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,100
unnatural or a bit sudden like they got

63
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,630
to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusions too quickly but I</font>

64
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">also really saw them trying to translate</font>

65
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,509
that to a different medium and trying to

66
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,950
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new and interesting with it</font>

67
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,229
and what I saw from that is this story

68
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a really strong young woman</font>

69
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,350
learning their own bodily strength

70
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,360
doesn't just come from her physicality

71
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,669
like in any normal way it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

72
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,709
from her mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then what she thinks</font>

73
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:11,650
and the things

74
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,599
she sees it's our own April fourth here

75
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,790
in the UK it's out today in the US I

76
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,629
just let me know your thoughts and

77
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,040
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm particularly interested in</font>

78
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,900
what you thought about the fun versus

79
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,459
dark fine whether you feel that there

80
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,750
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like an indecision in the</font>

81
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,120
tone that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of compelled the viewer</font>

82
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,670
to sort of pick a quick aside in terms

83
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,670
of how they see this dystopic futuristic

84
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,519
Chicago inevitably there are never been

85
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,049
in the life of this book comparisons to

86
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,579
the Hunger Games<font color="#E5E5E5"> one crucial thing about</font>

87
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:37,959
that is that the film doesn't I think

88
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked as much of the viewer in the same</font>

89
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,980
way that the Hunger Games does one of

90
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,030
the looks that countless<font color="#E5E5E5"> dozen to the</font>

91
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,379
lens they really challenged the view and

92
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,180
there isn't that same there isn't kind

93
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,340
of like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> parallel experience there but</font>

94
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,019
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there needs to be and</font>

95
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,569
I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really how much we</font>

96
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,340
benefit from comparing these two stories

97
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,590
which are I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually entirely</font>

98
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,150
different two things I was particularly

99
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">pleased with I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really loved the zip wire</font>

100
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,709
scene and I really loved the Navy Pier

101
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,989
scene because those are my two favorite

102
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,670
scenes in the book so yeah that's so

103
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,079
version again let me know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you think</font>

104
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,790
in comments and I will see you guys on

105
00:03:09,790 --> 00:00:00,000
Monday bye
