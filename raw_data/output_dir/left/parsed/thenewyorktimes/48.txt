I’m Nicole Holofcener.
And I adapted the book
and directed the movie,
"The Land of Steady Habits."
This is Ben Mendelsohn
playing Anders Hill.
He’s left his wife and
moved into a condo.
And while he was drunk,
he told the cab driver
his old address.
And when they pulled up, he
didn’t realize where he was.
And then he decided
to go in anyway.
What the hell?
I wanted this scene —
it’s not in the book —
and I wanted to see
Anders enjoy being a jerk.
But he sort of wears his
jerkiness with pride.
"Who the ____ is in my house?
Jesus Christ, Anders."
And he makes a
fool of himself.
And I think that
it always helps
when a character is drunk, if
they need to make a fool out
of themselves.
And Ben plays a
terrific drunk.
“You can’t just come in here."
“I’m getting some things
that are rightfully mine."
“No, you’re drunk."
“Some of this stuff,
I have a right
to have it in my house."
“I left a whole box
of stuff for you
over here by the door."
“Then what’s all this?"
“I gave you half."
And I feel he played
a very subtle drunk.
“Oh."
So he breaks into
the house and he
goes straight into
the refrigerator
and doesn’t
recognize anything.
I wanted really like
airy, fairy healthy crap
in the freezer that would
not have been in his house.
We shoot the refrigerator.
I think we had a
fake light in it.
Because the
refrigerator is noisy.
So we turn it off for
the sound department.
And by the time we
got to the next scene,
where he’s eating a
Popsicle, the refrigerator
had been turned off.
And the Popsicles just
kept cracking in half
and falling on the floor.
That was pretty sad.
It was like, what happened?
Why don’t they freeze?
Why don’t they freeze?
And then we realized
the prop department
didn’t realize that they had
not turned the power back on.
