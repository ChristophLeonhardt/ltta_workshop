Four more meals left,
and I’m out of the hole.
Can’t sleep the night before.
Waiting, waiting.
Oh my God, waiting.
Trying not to jones out.
Knowing it’s coming, but
wishing it was faster.
It’s finally here, and
I start the ritual.
I load it up … and shove it in.
Draw back. Make sure you don’t
miss because it’ll hurt.
Sending it. Feeling the rush.
Every hair stands up,
and you start sweating.
Getting that cough.
Huh!
That’s the best part.
Starting to spin.
Out of control.
Like, we have 
one chance. Like …
one chance to get the girls back.
That’s it, John.
That is it.
And if we fuck up, we
don’t get them back.
I'm not going to —
They’re going up for
fucking adoption.
My sister’s going
to raise those kids.
Your uncle’s going
to raise those girls.
No, it ain’t going to
happen like that, because
I am going to fucking
straighten out,
and I’m going to smarten up.
I’m not going to let
that happen, Saundra.
If I have to go to a fucking
six-month rehab to get our girls back …
I will.
 There’s a vehicle 
almost going into the ditch.
I don’t know.
I’ve seen police,
and I always feel
like they’re looking at me.
I always feel like everyone’s
looking at me, really.
I know.
No, but it just
seems like every time
I see a cop drive by me, right?
That’s a cop right there.
(SINGING) Sometimes I feel
like I don’t have a partner.
Sometimes I feel like my only
friend is the city I live in.
So first of all,
how are you doing?
No.
No?
— No.
Still struggling?
Yeah, I’ve been not really
having a place to stay.
Yeah, that makes things
even harder, right?
Yeah, I know that I’m going
to ever stop until I want to.
Or until you’re stopped, right?
Right.
Honestly, what changed
it all is — that.
When I started doing it,
that changed everything.
Right, that’s a game
changer in itself.
Absolutely.
Ultimately, you know it’s
not going to end up anywhere good.
Right, and I’ve never been to
rehab or anything like that before.
The only time I’ve
kicked is, you know …
I have done it on
the streets on my own.
Right.
But it never lasted for too
long, maybe two months,
two and half months.
But jail is the
only way it’s ever
really stopped for a while.
And the other thing
is too, though, is
being stuck in that cycle of,
like, being on the streets.
You know everybody in town.
You’ve been around this town
your whole life, so it’s like —
And you have a reputat —
people expect certain
things from you.
Right, people are coming
to you looking for stuff,
or you’re seeing them.
And you know they have stuff.
Right.
The chances of
staying clean are —
Slim to none.
Can you see me now?
Hi.
Hi, baby.
I miss you.
Hey, baby.
You are getting so big.
I love you.
Hi.
Hi, chunker munkers.
I love you.
See how excited she is?
She doesn’t look as
excited to see me.
Daddy.
Hi, baby girl.
I miss you so much.
She’s so excited.
Hey, sweetie.
We love you.
What?
What?
Love you.
Love you too.
I love you, Bella.
I see you tomorrow, O.K.?
Together forever, never apart.
Maybe in distance,
but never in heart.
That’s right, baby.
Together forever, never apart.
Maybe in distance,
but never in heart.
Because you’re in
my heart always.
Careful, honey.
I just did a handstand.
No way.
It’s because you’re so talented.
Hey, I love you, baby.
I love you.
I love you.
I’ll see you tomorrow, O.K.?
O.K.?
O.K.
I love you.
Love you, baby.
Sweet dreams.
(SINGING) Anything you can
do, I can do better.
Anything you can
do, I can do better.
I can do anything
better than you.
No, you can’t.
Yes, I can.
Anything you can do,
I can do greater.
Anything you — wait,
how did it go again?
(SINGING) And I never liked
to admit that I was wrong.
I’ve been so caught in my job,
didn’t see what’s going on.
But now I know, I’m better
sleeping on my own.
'Cause if you like that way you
look that much, oh baby,
you should go and fuck yourself.
I will. I do.
What?
You will and what?
I do.
It’s great.
Hey, John, it’s Phil
from Navigating Recovery.
I’m calling, man.
I haven’t heard from you
or seen you recently.
And I was hoping that we
could get together soon
and work on a plan to
help you out here, man.
Give us a call.
All right, John.
Take care, buddy.
Bye.
I’m here for you, O.K.?
You got to take care of you
before you can take care of —
I know the way the
heart wants to go, O.K.?
Follow it, O.K.?
Follow it.
Why, why, why, why?
You know why, O.K.?
You know why, and you can
take care of yourself.
Fucked up, fucked up, fuck up.
O.K., and all those kids
ain’t going to fucking
remember a goddamn thing, O.K.?
And they’ll love that guy, and you
can be that daddy that you are,
and that husband.
She loves you to
death, and I don’t
think you should
cheat them like that.
You know, you’re cheating
them out of you, O.K.?
Because “you” is a good person.
O.K.?
(OVER RADIO) He is suspended
and on probation.
I’m trying.
It’s just hard.
People take one
look at me, and they
think they know everything.
Just because I know what I
look like, and it’s not fair.
And I try to be
understanding and patient.
But … I’m a human being, too.
People don’t know me.
When was the last time you used?
A few days ago.
— A few days ago?
Yeah.
Are you O.K.?
Yeah, I just don’t
want to do it anymore.
Did you get sick?
Yeah, I mean it’s like …
at that point,
when I need some place to
sleep, or some place
to take a shower, or something.
It’s like I’m going
to go somewhere,
and any place I go, people use.
And they …
It’s like fucked up.
In my life, like a
way of showing love
is by giving something
that destroys them.
You know what I mean?
Like, that’s how you show love.
And to the rest of society,
and the rest of the world,
it’s like, “What the fuck?”
(OVER TELEPHONE) Hey, John.
Phil from Navigating Recovery.
Man, I’m just starting to get
worried about your situation.
You know, I know that your
probation officer, Trish,
is getting to the end
of her rope,
and I don’t want to see her
send you back to jail.
So if you get this message,
man, give me a call.
I’m still here to help you,
and I’d really like to do that.
So give me a call, man.
All right, take care.
Bye.
Every time.
Is that what I do
when I get high, too?
Hey, crazy lady.
You all right?
I just want to get out of here.
Just on your face.
Put some in your hands,
and splash it on your face.
So like, getting out hopeful …
and finding nothing.
Trying hard … 
but there’s no support.
I seek … success
but I find destruction.
Oblivion awaits.
