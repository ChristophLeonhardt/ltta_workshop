good evening from Yorick I'm Chris Hayes every day it seems the president of the United States sounds more and more like an authoritarian strong man from the country we no longer recognize as our own today's latest demonstration came as it so often does in a tweet quote we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country when somebody comes in we must immediately with no judges or court cases bring them back from where they came our system is a mockery to good immigration policy in law and order now you could write off Donald Trump's constant tweet storming as nothing more than sound and fury if not for what's actually happening this very moment in our country the 2300 immigrant children taken from their families some of them toddlers even babies the building of tent cities on military bases camps told children inside which we might add we only have government provided images because media are not allowed to independently record what goes on inside there the turning away of asylum seekers well documented by now at ports of entry against our own laws and now according the Texas Tribune our government effectively holding many of these immigrant children we've taken from their parents children our government ripped away from them holding them as hostages to then force people to give up their legal asylum claims and agree to be deported this is the backdrop for the president's explicit call to deport people at will without any recourse to a legal system or any acknowledgement of the rule of law but for anyone tempted to shrug off the president's tweet this morning he revisited the topic later in the day and we have to change our laws we have to make them sensible they came in to see me last week they said we'd like to hire 5,000 more judges 5,000 you ever hear of a thing like that judges well we're appointing 145 judges here and everyone goes through this extreme vetting process another about 5,000 where do you find 5,000 people to be judges and you know what bleeds it leads to graft it leads to a lot of other things president is a little confused about immigration judges who are very different than the appellate and district court judges he's appointing but that's for another time now it has been a through-line of this president's rhetoric that he doesn't really even bother bother to pretend to care about the Constitution makes no pretense of it but we are currently getting a very bleak picture of what that worldview looks like when it is put into practice on vulnerable populations at the border Senator Richard Blumenthal democratic Connecticut visited the tent city 400 children Tornillo Texas last week and maybe let me start by asking you what does it look like up close when you saw as you have been reporting so well for the last weeks Chris it is a heartbreaking deepening humanitarian crisis and again the flu line here is in every one of these policies the president is using children as pawns and hostages first to try to pressure Congress from to changing the law he's now defying it then to persuade some of these asylum seekers to leave the country if they are reunited there is no plan for reunification and there is deepening chaos and confusion even among the border agents the Border Patrol agents and the United States Customs and Border Protection agents who say we need more judges we need more resources to effectively and fairly enforce the law so abandoning and abrogating due process has consequences not only financially but also morally let me ask you this I mean you're in the United States Senator and we have consistent reporting that CBP is turning people away at ports of entry when asking for asylum that they even in some cases move their checkpoint to the median of the bridge so that no tow can touch American soil that is a violation on its face of American law what is Congress doing about that the Congress very fat Lee and unconscionably is doing nothing and I believe and I'm calling for it right now and in the next few days that Congress must have hearings we have an oversight responsibility the Judiciary Committee where I said should be having hearings this week to old accountable the officials for turning away those asylum seekers at the ports of entry in effect denying them the credible fear hearing that they're entitled to receive if they're in this country and abrogating due process remember due process is not only about fundamental fairness and the rule of law it's also about making sure that determinations are accurate because in many instances if we unfairly and inaccurately deny asylum we are in effect very likely condemning these people to death torture and other forms of violence well let's be clear not just them I mean correct me if I'm wrong what the president is calling for is an extra legal unaccountable and non-reviewable deportation force that can take people out of the country with no judicial review is there any reason to believe that such a thing a is constitutional or B would not result in American citizens being deported it will be challenged it will be found illegal and unconstitutional when and if it's challenged but more broadly and fundamentally this country is heading for a train wreck at the border because beyond those due process issues arising with respect to the asylum seekers at the ports of entry and the due process hearings were also threatening I say we the president is threatening to imprison tens of thousands of these individuals as he continues to prosecute them in camps that are very reminiscent of the internment facilities for the Japanese during World War two on military bases at tremendous financial cost in fact I visit a facility very much like the one that the president's contemplating the cost per person they're $2,000 per day think of it $2,000 per day wait $2,000 per day for a person put a person at the ill ternal Hill tonio facility in El Paso so we're talking about financial cost but also moral and humanitarian costs all right Senator Richard Blumenthal thank you for joining me thank you attorney natalia Cornelio is directly the criminal justice reform program at the Texas Civil Rights Project and they've been representing a lot of the folks who have been detained by ice and prosecuted first let's let's start with update about what is happening on the ground because there's lots of confusion let me start with this is separation still happening where has that stopped to your knowledge my knowledge separation has stopped as a Friday and Monday we met no parents who had been separated from their children so the last time we met with parents who had been separated from their children was last Thursday the day after the executive order was signed so there's confusion a little bit between CBP which is saying we're not recommending people for a prosecution DOJ wants to keep saying we're prosecuting everyone because they have this zero-tolerance policy they adhere to but what are you hearing about this idea that was reported in Texas Tribune of parents essentially being offered you can get your kid back if you sign this and agree to be deported immediately and waive your right to asylum have you heard that we have heard from the relative of one of our clients that he was told that he would be reunited with his child if he signed a voluntary departure we also heard from the majority of the people that we interviewed that they would do anything to be reunited with their child and so the concern is regardless of whether they're told explicitly by CBP that choice are not any decision that they would have to make regarding their immigration situation under the circumstances of not having their child with them by force is concerning it's a coerced decision essentially so we're concerned about that is there progress being made in notifying clients of yours about where their children are and how they can go about reunifying with them the process is very slow it's essentially in Department of Homeland Security's hands of course this all could have been avoided if parents had never been separated from their children what we are doing now is scrambling as quickly as possible essentially racing the clock to try to assure that parents are unified with their children before something as serious as a deportation separate from one another and we do know of at least one case where the children were deported while the parents remained in custody in the United States the children because we've owned this is important we have tracked numerous cases of parents being deported what children remain in custody you're saying the opposite of children being sent back without their parents into a country they have fled because of danger that's right and at least one case that's right what do you what does it say to you or what are you hear when you hear the present date swell building you know going ahead with plans to build camps on military bases keeping these children away from their parents say it's ridiculous all this judges all this law talk we need to grab people and deport them what do you say to that I think that this problem of parents being separated from this children this humanitarian Human Rights crisis if their word due process if people were entitled to attorneys and were able to see judges this would have never happened so I actually think that this traumatic experience that America just went through could have been avoided if the opposite of what the president is saying had happened so it's not only a violation of international human rights law and our laws but what just happened is proof of what could continue to happen if no due process is provided explain that what do you mean the lack of due process the lack of access to courts or hearing officers the lack of access to attorneys is what allows the government to have a non transparent system making a sweeping administrative decision to separate parents from their children and it's only until you know civil rights lawyers find out about it and scramble to try to talk to the parents that the information starts being tracked by anybody but the government and so this type of behavior of a sweeping policy that's really concerning on a human rights level could happen if there's no due process if there's no access to courts or hearings or attorneys those things protect human rights violations civil rights violations law violations from happening so those are an important check on that and I think that everyone should agree that there's got to be space to agree that civil rights and human rights have to be included in any dialogue about policy we should know what the only reason we know about this isn't because the government it's because of lawyers who are in courtrooms he was suing over and telling and talking reporters about it they were the point of contact while this policy was happening behind closed doors in a black box and children were being ripped from their parents and Italia cornelio thank you for what you're doing appreciate hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you
