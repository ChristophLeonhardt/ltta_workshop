so researchers decided they were going to look into what made you the most likely to vote for Donald Trump okay well that's important and interesting and they had a number of professors look at this studied it talked to about 1,500 people so it's a good sample size and they published in the journal e journal of sociology of religion because it turns out the thing that made you most likely to vote for Donald Trump was actually religion well it's a lot more specific than that though so let me dive into this and and explain the findings suggest that Christian nationalism is a unique and independent influence that led to the Trump presidency as Carol korvia explains it outpost so first of all if you're not familiar with it what is it Christian nationalism is an ideology that fuses Christians love of God and country it hinges on the narrative that the United States has a special covenant with the Christian God now look I'm not a religious person so I it's hard for me to understand that kind of thinking that that there is a Christian God and and in the Bible there's even another God that wants defeats the Christian God read the Bible it's a fascinating text so is there a Muslim God there's a Jewish God and then they fight every once in a while and there's a royal battle Battle Royale I don't know it's to me it all seems unbelievable but a lot of people believe not only Christianity but this form of Christian nationalism where they think no my Christian God is right and he's meant to rule this country now these folks of course are not Patriots they don't even really believe in the idea of America America is a secular country it's written in our Constitution they're not big fans of reading I look I gotta be honest with you they haven't read the constitution that says we shall not establish a religion how much clear didn't need to be when you take a half an amendment like half of the Second Amendment you ignore the part about the militia well-regulated part and you say all guns says guns well didn't you read the First Amendment did you read the rest of the Constitution where it says that you will not have any religious test for office we shall not establish a religion we are secular in our founding and they just refused to recognize it and they would rather live in a country that is run by religion like Iran or Saudi Arabia or the Vatican and so that is Christian nationalism it's literal I'm not the one who says that they're the ones who say and it's in this in this polling so they explained further in the sociology of religion America's who embrace this narrative and perceived threats to that identity overwhelmingly voted for Trump and that's what it is it's about their identity if they perceive an attack like for example this video they if they watch it they'll lose their minds oh we know your God is wrong or you're an atheist and that's why you're gonna burn in hell or whatever it is I know I'm right and if you say I'm not like you're attacking my identity now they'll say that I'm not right all day long they don't mind that at all Muslims they are the worst as you're about to see they don't mind its hacking other people's identity but if you even touch their identity a little bit there's so hurt they're so hurt nothing but snowflakes as far as the eye can see it's a blizzard okay so now let's dive into what their concerns are because this is a group that elected Donald Trump and if you don't know white evangelicals specifically white evangelicals showed up at an astounding eighty five percent voter turnout and eighty-one percent of them voted for Donald Trump that's why he won the election now I showed you that in the polling earlier now this just dives in a little bit more to find out why and what other characteristics by the way today pull out in fact it was done recently by Pew Research and still at this late juncture no damn moved at all 78% of white evangelicals still support Donald Trump so they use different statements to determine their affinity for Christian nationalism for the people who voted for and for everybody in the study but this is a group that tested most positive for Trump so one thing that they asked was the federal government should enforce strict separation of church and state now people who answered no or hell no to that were very likely to vote for Donald Trump people who answered yes to these five were also likely to vote for Trump the federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation that's just amazing man we live in two different worlds they think they were shit literally we should just shred the Constitution and become a theocracy and we should declare this a Christian nation the federal government should do that they also say overwhelmingly the federal government should advocate Christian values not any other religion just Christian values the federal government should allow the display of religious symbols in public spaces the success of the United States is part of God's plan because God can't stand Canada or Cambodia any way the federal government should allow prayer in public schools that is another tenant of theirs ok so now let's go more to the analysis the researchers included a few control variables including responses to the Baylor survey that measured participants economic satisfaction sexism racism attitudes towards undocumented immigrants and views of Muslims and we'll come back to that one because they did have views on Muslims to make sure that Christian nationalism isn't acting as a proxy for political conservatism or religiosity the team also included controls for things like party affiliation conservative religious beliefs and religious practice what they found was that even after controlling for these other influences Americans who supported five of those statements and rejected the one on church-state separation were much more likely to have voted for Trump so it wasn't that you were more religious overall it was that you believe these tenets that you're a Christian nationalist that's what made the difference okay in fact a Democrat who held views consistent with Christian nationalism was three times more likely to vote for Trump than a Democrat who didn't hold such views on the other hand Republicans who scored low on the Christian nationalism decks were less likely to vote for Trump so we have our answer we know who overwhelmingly voted for Trump and put him in office and we know why because they would like to turn this into a Christian nation that's not hyperbole that's not fear-mongering that's what they say and in fact when you talk to the professor's who did the study they explained that the reason why those white evangelicals are still willing to look past all of Donald Trump's sins all the things that they said they cared about before family values that divorces the extramarital affairs with porn stars and the list goes on and on and on they say it's okay because God makes choices on who his messenger is and it's not related to the messenger or the messengers actions for whatever reason because God always works in mysterious ways God has chosen Trump as his vessel and so if God has made a decision it's over now how do they know God made that decision they don't their leaders told him that their leaders told them that why because Trump is giving them extraordinary access before the election during the campaigning he had an advisory board filled with evangelical leaders and he said I'll give you guys power and they said great and they went to all of their sheep I mean flock and and they said to them yeah God chose Trump don't worry about anything he did because God chose him already good know you don't better than God know you don't know better than God shut up and vote for Trump they won't again absolutely Trump it is okay so it doesn't matter you there's you can't move them off that position because God can't be wrong all right another strong predictor of a vote for Trump in Whitehead study and he was all the professors who did it was anti-muslim sentiment say it with me oh of course it was so now Christian Nationals are the most important but then Muslim is also very very high on the list so what do they want to do with Muslims you'll make sure they're okay because the Christian thing would be to look out for your neighbor right no that would require reading the Bible all right statements used to measure attitudes towards Muslims and they scored high on all these refugees from the Middle East posed a terrorist threat to the United States not some not the terrorists themselves no refugees period Muslims hold values that are morally inferior to the values of people like me that scored really high Muslims hold values that are morally inferior but when you say hey I'm a little worried that you might be a white supremacist or apparently a Christian national supremacist they're like what do you mean of course not I mean you're inferior to me but I'd and I'm superior to you I'm supreme above you but how could you go be a supremacist how could you do that okay so but if you tell these people you're not good people you judge other human beings by the way unlike Jesus Christ and you are filled with fear and loathing and hatred and politicians use that to hoodwink you they go but Muslim huh that's what I think about Muslims and they're totally fine with it like oh you hate Muslims like I do great you got my vote here are more things that they strongly agreed with Muslims want to limit the personal freedoms of people like me well ironically they answered an earlier questions that they would like to limit the freedoms of other people and turn this into a Christian nation that only serves them but miss the irony completely and finally Muslims endanger the physical safety of people like me again not terrorists not radical Muslims just Muslims they endanger me why conservatives as we've discussed before there's been Studies on this they have a larger and Magdala and there are other reasons but generally they are more afraid than progressives they are afraid of change they're afraid of the others they're afraid that's why when you ask Muslims in danger the physical safety people like yes yes I'm so afraid I'm so afraid I need a leader I need a leader who's gonna protect me that's why when Donald Trump said the preposterous thing in his acceptance speech at the convention that only I can protect you people with logic and reason roll their eyes from like what a buffoon who says only I can protect you what there's nobody else that can protect you and but to them that made sense because they're so afraid and they look for a leader to tell them what to do who should we hate dear leader oh we should hate the Muslims and we should just turn this nation into one that only serves Christians yes that's my guy he's the only guy who could do it so they're not gonna turn on him he could have 17 new affairs if we find out that he's had abortions that he's paid for abortions of mistresses or wives or whatever it still will not turn them it will not turn them because God makes mysterious choices and and he has chosen Trump to make this a Christian nation and so we're done with it all the things that Trump has done still 78% right there on his side so now you know what we're up against and so the idea that Democrats have that no no no no we can win over these Trump voters there's a lot of different Trump voters but these are the most hardcore ones that we could win over hardcore Trump voters really how what are you gonna do you guys all right let's just turn it into a Christian nation who Jews who cares about them get out of here right Muslims we obviously hate etcetera etcetera let's just turn into a Christian nation and declare that they are superior is that we're gonna do to win over these guys then you're not gonna win them over the only way to win them over and I know that this will also shock them is to win the culture wars is to convince the younger generation of logic and reason and facts and evidence that there is not a sky god that hates everyone that doesn't look like you that that's just not true and it's also not true that the United States Constitution is in favor of setting up a Christian nation it says the exact act opposite just read it all you have to do is read it so we have to win that war and we have to defeat these people because there is no there's no reaching out to them they're not interested in you they want to rule over you all right that's the reality of it now you know if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do
