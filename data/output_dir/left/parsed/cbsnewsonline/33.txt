ASIDE EVERY NOTION OF DECENCY 
AND DUE PROCESS. 
NOBODY'S SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. 
BUT EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE A 
CHANCE IN JUST FOUR WEEKS TO 
RENDER YOUR VERDICT ON THE 
DEMOCRATS' CONDUCT AT THE 
BALLOT BOX. 
ON NOVEMBER 6, YOU WILL HAVE 
THE CHANCE TO STOP THE RADICAL 
DEMOCRATS AND THAT'S WHAT 
THEY'VE BECOME. 
BY ELECTING A REPUBLICAN HOUSE 
AND A REPUBLICAN SENATE. 
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 
EVERY AMERICAN HAS NOW SEEN THE 
PROFOUND STAKES IN THE UPCOMING 
ELECTION. 
YOU KNOW SEE IT. 
WE HAVE BEEN ENERGIZED. 
WE HAVE BEEN ENERGIZED. 
IF DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO 
CAUSE SUCH DESTRUCTION IN THE 
PURSUIT OF POWER, JUST IMAGINE 
THE DEVASTATION THEY WOULD 
CAUSE IF THEY GOT THE POWER 
THEY SO DESPERATELY WANT.
WE HAVE POSITIONS TO BE FILLED. 
IT COULD BE THREE, FOUR, A LOT. 
AND IF YOU ALLOW THE WRONG 
PEOPLE TO GET INTO OFFICE, 
THINGS COULD CHANGE. 
THEY COULD CHANGE FAST AND 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT 
HAPPEN. 
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. 
IT COULD CHANGE VERY FAST. 
YOU DON'T SEE THAT HAPPEN. 
YOU DON'T HAND MATCHES TO AN 
ARSONIST AND YOU DON'T GIVE 
POWER TO AN ANGRY LEFT WING 
MOB. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BECOME. 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME TOO 
DANGEROUS AND TOO EXTREME TO BE 
GOVERNED. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN THE RULE 
OF LAW, NOT THE RULE OF THE 
MOB. 
WE ARE DRAINING THE SWAMP AND 
WE WANT TO BEAT THE DEMOCRATS.
AMERICA IS WINNING BECAUSE 
WE'RE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA 
FIRST. 
WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 
YESTERDAY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT 
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN TO 
3.7%. 
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN 
50 YEARS. 
WE
IF I EVER SAID THAT THE FAKE 
NEWS MEDIA WOULD GO AND SAY 
IMPOSSIBLE. 
IMPOSSIBLE. 
THEY ARE FAKE. 
MANUFACTURING CONFIDENCE IS AT 
AN ALL-TIME HIGH. 
CONFIDENCE, VERY IMPORTANT. 
AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. 
WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THE BEST. 
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
VETERANS. 
PROTECTING OUR GREAT SENIORS. 
AND REBUILDING AMERICA'S 
MILITARY MIGHT LIKE IT HASN'T 
BEEN BUILT BEFORE. 
BUT IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL, 
THEY WILL TRY TO PLUNGE OUR 
COUNTRY INTO GRIDLOCK, POVERTY 
AND CHAOS AND THAT'S WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN. 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
THEY WANT TO IMPOSE SOCIALLY. 
LIKE VENEZUELA. 
DISMANTLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 
ELIMINATE OUR BORDERS. 
THEY WANT TO HAVE NICE OPEN 
BORDERS. 
NO WAY. 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME THE 
PARTY OF CRIME. 
THEY HAVE BECOME THE PARTY OF 
CRIME. 
THINK OF IT. 
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF 
LAW AND ORDER AND JUSTICE. 
AND WE REALLY HAVE BECOME EVEN 
MORE SO THAN EVER BEFORE THE 
PARTY OF OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. 
THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
WITH CREATES WEALTH FOR 
EVERYONE. 
WHETHER IT'S SMALL BUSINESSES, 
BIG BUSINESSES, PEOPLE WANTING 
GREAT JOBS. 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
WAGES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 19 
YEARS, WAGES ARE GOING UP. 
AND JOBS, YOU CAN CHOOSE THE 
JOB YOU WANT FOR THE FIRST 
TIME. 
WE ARE JOINED BY A NUMBER OF 
YOUR STATES, TERRIFIC 
REPUBLICAN LEADERS. 
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I 
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. 
BUT THIS IS SUCH A BIG DAY. 
THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DAY. 
I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL YOU. 
DO YOU MIND CALLING THEM AND 
TELLING THEM THAT BECAUSE OF 
THE FACT THAT WE ARE TODAY 
GETTING THIS GREAT, GREAT 
TALENTED WONDERFUL SUPREME 
COURT JUDGE. 
CAN YOU CALL THE PEOPLE OF 
KANSAS AND TELL THEM WE CAN'T 
MAKE IT TONIGHT? 
I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO. 
I DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE. 
SIR, WE'RE SIGNING THE NEXT 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE. 
YOU HEARD IT. 
THE BIGGEST THING A PRESIDENT 
CAN DO, THEY ALWAYS SAID IT, IS 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
WE'VE HAD TWO IN LESS THAN TWO 
YEARS I GUESS. 
IT'S THE BIGGEST THING YOU CAN 
DO. 
SO THEY SAID SIR, DO YOU MIND 
CANCELING KANSAS TONIGHT? 
I SAID NO WAY I'M CANCELING 
KANSAS. 
NO WAY. 
NO WAY. 
I HAD THAT PHONE WORKING. 
I HAD THAT PHONE WORKING ON 
THAT PLANE. 
I HAD THAT SIGNATURE GOING ON 
THE PLANE. 
AND HERE WE ARE. 
BY THE WAY, YOU THINK THIS 
CROWD INSIDE IS BIG? 
YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE CROWD 
THAT'S OUTSIDE. 
WE JUST PUT UP BIG MOVIE 
SCREENS BUT I THINK THIS IS 
BETTER. 
RIGHT? 
I WANT TO THANK CONGRESSMAN 
ROGER MARSH. 
A GREAT FRIEND. 
HE HELPED US SO MUCH WITH THE 
TAX CUTS. 
WITH REGULATION CUTS. 
WITH SO MANY THINGS. 
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. 
WHERE ARE THEY? 
WHERE ARE THEY?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOLKS. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
FANTASTIC. 
AND ALSO, I WANT TO THANK 
SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE A 
FANTASTIC JOB. 
GOP CHAIR KELLY ARNOLD. 
A GREAT JOB. 
YOU KNOW WHY A GREAT JOB? 
BECAUSE WE WON THIS STATE BY A 
LOT. 
RIGHT? 
AND AFTER WHAT I JUST DID FOR 
YOU WITH THE NEW DEAL, WITH 
MEXICO AND CANADA, I THINK WE 
SHOULD DOUBLE IT UP. 
USMCA. 
USM A. I REFUSE TO CALL IT 
NAFTA BECAUSE NAFTA WAS SUCH A 
HORRIBLE DEAL. 
YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE. 
50,000 PLANTS AND FACTORIES 
EMPTIED OUT. 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS 
LOST. 
SO, WE NEGOTIATED A NEW DEAL. 
USMCA. 
AND WE OPENED UP AGRICULTURE. 
WE OPENED UP DAIRY. 
WE OPENED UP A LOT OF THINGS AN 
EVERYBODY'S REALLY HAPPY. 
DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE DOING IN 
THE OTHER PLACES BUT THEY'RE 
REALLY HAPPY. 
SO CONGRATULATIONS. 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
AND WE ALSO SIGNED A GREAT NEW 
DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. 
AND THE FARMERS WILL BE 
BENEFITING THERE TOO. 
AND, WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW, 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. 
WE'RE WORKING ON A DEAL WITH 
CHINA. 
WE'LL SEE. 
WE'LL SEE. 
LOOK, THEY'VE BEEN HITTING US 
HARD FOR A LONG TIME. 
WE NEVER HAD A PRESIDENT THAT 
DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 
$500BILLION A YEAR. 
THAT'S A BIG ONE. 
SO, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE DOING 
EXTREMELY WELL. 
AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
MAYBE WE'LL DO IT AND IF WE 
DON'T, WE'LL BE AN EVEN BETTER 
POSITION. 
YOU UNDERSTAND. 
I WANT TO THANK AN INCREDIBLE 
MAN OF INTEGRITY AND CLASS. 
YOUR GOVERNOR, JEFF COLIER. 
THERE IS JEFF? 
HE'S DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN 
THANKING JEFF. 
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW YOU. 
WHEN I BACKED CHRIS, AND, YOU 
HAVE WON HECK OF A GOVERNOR. 
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO TALK 
ABOUT BRINGING HIM DOWN TO 
WASHINGTON OR SOMETHING. 
GREAT GOVERNOR. 
A GREAT MAN. 
WE'RE JOINED BY KANSAS ATTORNEY 
GENERAL DEREK SCHMIDT. 
THANK YOU. 
AND PRESIDENT OF THE KANSAS 
STATE SENATE. 
SUSAN WENGEL. 
SUSAN. 
YOU KNOW BRAD. 
BRAD. 
GUY'S LIKE SEVEN FEET TALL SO 
YOU CAN'T MISS HIM. 
THANK YOU BRAD. 
OUR CHIEF, YOU KNOW HIM. 
OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, 
MIKE GLASCER. 
YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? 
HE'S BEEN FANTASTIC. 
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. 
THANK YOU MICHAEL. 
THEY ALL COME FROM KANSAS. 
THEY ALL COME FROM KANSAS. 
I GUESS THAT'S HOW WE WIN. 
WE GET FROM KANSAS, YOU WIN. 
ALONG WITH OUR AMAZING 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO. 
HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. 
HE'S HEADED OFF. 
THIS GUY TRAVELS. 
YEAH. 
GOT TO DO THAT. 
IF YOU'RE HOME A LOT, YOU'RE 
NOT DOING MUCH OF A GOOD JOB. 
WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH 
EVERYBODY. 
MIKE POMPEO FROM KANSAS. 
RIGHT NOW. 
AND ALSO HERE WITH US TONIGHT 
IS YOUR NEXT LIEUTENANT 
GOVERNMENT. 
WINK HARTMAN. 
THANK YOU WINK. 
THANK YOU WINK. 
SO, A MAN THAT'S BEEN WITH ME 
FROM THE BEGINNING. 
HE'S STRONG AND I HATED THAT HE 
RAN BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE LOVED 
TO HAVE BROUGHT HIM INTO MY 
ADMINISTRATION. 
IF HE LOSES. 
I HOPE HE LOSES BECAUSE I WANT 
HIM SO BADLY. 
BUT DON'T DO THAT. 
DON'T DO THAT. 
I WAS ANGRY WHEN HE DID IT. 
I SAID DON'T DO IT. 
SIR, I WANT TO BE THE GOVERNOR 
OF KANSAS. 
I LOVE MY PEOPLE. 
I SAID GO AHEAD. 
GO AHEAD. 
I WAS VERY UNHAPPY. 
I WAS VERY, VERY UNHAPPY. 
HE'S BEEN WINNING AND DOING AN 
INCREDIBLE JOB. 
I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT 
GOVERNOR OF KANSAS. 
CHRIS KOBAK. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP, WELCOME TO 
TRUMP COUNTRY. 
IT IS SUCH AN HONOR AND A 
BLESSING TO HAVE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HERE IN THE CITY WHERE I 
GREW UP. 
THIS IS MY CAMPAIGN IN THE 
STATE WE ALL LOVE. 
I WANT TO GIVE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CREDIT FOR SOMETHING. 
THE MOST IMPORTANT IS STOPPING 
THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
I'M SO GLAD THAT AMERICA HAS A 
PRESIDENT WHO GETS IT. 
AND KNOWS THAT ILLEGAL MEANS 
ILLEGAL. 
I WANT TO TELL YOU A QUICK 
SHORT STORY ABOUT ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
I WAS WORKING ON THIS ISSUE IN 
THE TIME OF 9/11. 
I WAS THERE DURING 9/11 AND WE 
ALL REMEMBER HOW THE WORLD 
CHANGED. 
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING 
YOU MAY NOT KNOW. 
ALL 19 HIJACKERS CAME INTO THIS 
COUNTRY LEGALLY ON TEMPORARY 
VISAS. 
FIVE OF THEM BECAME ILLEGAL 
MOSTLY BY OVERSTAYING THEIR 
VISAS. 
FOUR OF THOSE FIVE WERE STOPPED 
BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FOR SPEEDING 
VIOLATIONS. 
THE COPS DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE 
HERE ILLEGALLY AND DIDN'T MAKE 
AN ARREST. 
THEY COULD HAVE IF THEY HAD 
THAT INFORMATION AT THEIR 
FINGERTIPS. 
THREE OF THOSE FOUR ILLEGAL 
ALIENS THEY ARRESTED WERE 
PILOTS. 
SO, IF THEY HAD MADE THOSE 
ARRESTS, THEY COULD HAVE 
STOPPED 9/11 FROM HAPPENING. 
THOSE NUMBERS HAVE SHAPED MY 
CAREER. 
THE GRAVITY OF THAT HAS NEVER 
LEFT ME. 
AND I WILL NOT. 
AND I KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL 
NOT ALLOW OUR IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM TO BE USED AGAIN AS A 
WEAPON TO HARM THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
STOPPING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS 
ABOUT OUR NATION'S SECURITY AND 
THAT COMES FIRST. 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS AN ISSUE 
IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR. 
DID YOU KNOW MY OPPONENT LAURA 
KELLY VOTED TO CONTINUE 
ALLOWING SANCTUARY CITIES IN 
KANSAS? 
SHE DID. 
SHE DID. 
LOOK IT UP. 
IT'S IN THE ROLL CALL VOTE. 
WHEN I'M GOVERNOR, SANCTUARY 
CITIES WILL END IN THIS STATE, 
GOD WILLING. 
SO WE'RE STRUGGLEING TO PAY OUR 
ELECTRICITY BILL. 
TO PAY HIGHER TAXES, WE ARE 
MEANWHILE GIVING TAXPAYER 
DOLLARS TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
IS THAT FAIR? 
IT'S TIME TO STOP ILLEGAL 
ALIENS FROM GETTING TAXPAYER 
DOLLARS. 
IT'S TIME TO PUT KANSASNS 
FIRST. 
NOT ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
 
>> THERE'S ANOTHER BIG ISSUE. 
THERE'S ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I HAVE BOTH 
BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT. 
VOTER FRAUD. 
BECAUSE OF THE LAW THAT I 
DRAFTED AND THE KANSAS 
LEGISLATURE PASSED, KANSAS HAS 
THE MOST SECURE ELECTION LAWS 
IN AMERICA. 
PHOTOID CREATES TRUST IN OUR 
ELECTIONS. 
IF YOU NEED A PHOTOIDEA TO CASH 
A CHECK OR BUY THE KIND OF 
SUDAFED THAT WORKS, YOU 
PROBABLY NEED ONE TO CAST A 
VOTE IN THE ELECTION. 
AND PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TOO. 
PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP. 
EVERY TIME AN ALIEN VOTES, 
EVERY TIME AN ALIEN VOTES, IT 
CANCELS OUT THE VOTE OF A U.S. 
CITIZEN. 
THE DEMOCRATS AND THEIR 
SOCIALIST FRIENDS CLAIM THEY 
CARE ABOUT VOTER CANCELLATION 
OR VOTER SUPPRESSION BUT THEY 
DON'T CARE ABOUT U.S. CITIZENS 
VOTE BEING CANCELED OUT. 
IT'S TIME FOR OTHER STATES TO 
REQUIRE PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP 
TOO.
ANOTHER THING. 
TAXES. 
THANKS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, OUR 
TAXES ARE MUCH LOWER. 
IN KANSAS, OUR STATE TAXES ARE 
THE HIGHEST IN THE REGION. 
IT'S TIME TO CUT OUR STATE 
TAXES HERE IN KANSAS. 
WHEN I'M GOVERNOR, THE FIRST 
BILL I WANT TO SIGN IS ONE THAT 
PASSES ALONG THE TRUMP TAX 
WINDFALL TO THE PEOPLE OF 
KANSAS. 
$137MILLION. 
AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU HAVE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN KANSAS 
BEEN TAXED OUT OF THEIR OWN 
HOME BECAUSE OF PROPERTY TAX 
APPRAISAL INCREASES. 
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE LIVE IN 
THE HOME THEY WANTED TO RETIRE 
IN. 
WHEN I'M GOVERNOR, WE WILL PUT 
A 2% CAP ON PROPERTY TAX 
APPRAISAL INCREASES. 
TO PUT IT SIMPLY, I WANT TO DO 
FOR KANSAS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS DONE FOR AMERICA. 
 WE HAVE A 
BIG ELECTION AHEAD OF US 
NOVEMBER 6. A BIG POINT OF 
CHOICE. 
A BIG DECISION FOR KANSAS. 
TONIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
HERE CALLING ON US TO GET OUT 
THERE AND VOTE. 
CALLING ON US TO STAND UP. 
THE TIME IS NOW TO STAND UP FOR 
THE PROVEN PRINCIPLES AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THAT HAVE 
MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT AND 
MADE THIS COUNTRY STRONG. 
AND THE TIME IS NOW. 
THAT WE MUST REJECT THE 
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS THAT THE 
PROGRESSIVES IN THE LEFT ARE 
CONSTANTLY PUTTING ON US. 
AND STAND UP. 
AND STAND UP FOR THE TIME 
TESTED VALUES OF HARD WORK. 
FAITH IN GOD, AND THE UNITED 
STATES CONSTITUTION. 
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE 
KANSAS GREAT AGAIN. 
>> WHAT A JOB HE DID FOR ME, 
I'LL TELL YOU. 
HE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT 
GOVERNOR. 
HE'S GOING TO DO THE JOB FOR 
YOU. 
HE IS A TIRELESS CHAMPION FOR 
VOTER SECURITY. 
PROTECT YOUR FAMILY. 
PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN. 
NOW, HIS FAR LEFT OPPONENT IS 
LAURA KELLY. 
VOTED TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
AND SHE SUPPORTS GIVING PUBLIC 
BENEFITS TO THE ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
LAURA KELLY EARNED AN F. NEVER 
EVEN HEARD OF AN F. AN F RATING 
FROM THE NRA. 
AN F. I ASSUME THAT MEANS SHE'S 
NOT TO BIG ON THE SECOND AMEND. 
EVERYONE GET OUT HERE AND VOTE 
FOR MY FRIEND KRIS KOBACH ON 
ELECTION DAY, PLEASE. 
FINALLY, I WANT TO INTRODUCE 
YOUR NEXT CONGRESSMAN. 
GET OUT AND VOTE. 
I NEED HIM IN WASHINGTON. 
STEVE IS A GREAT VETERAN. 
A GREAT PATRIOT. 
AND A PROUD WEST POINT 
GRADUATE. 
THAT MEANS HE'S VERY SMART. 
STEVE, COME ON UP. 
HEY. 
CAST
>> HEY, KANSASNS CAN DO 
ANYTHING. 
I'M PROOF OF THAT. 
I GREW UP A COUPLE OF MILES 
AWAY AND HERE I AM STANDING 
NEXT TO THE LEADER OF THE FREE 
WORLD. 
NOT JUST ANY LEADER. 
A TRULY GREAT ONE. 
YOU SEE, WHEN I LEFT KANSAS, I 
WENT AND AMONG OTHER THINGS I 
SPENT EIGHT YEARS IN WAR ZONES. 
EIGHT YEARS WITH MY BOOTS IN 
THE SAND OF IRAQ AND 
AFGHANISTAN. 
EIGHT YEARS. 
AND IN ALL THAT TIME, ALL THAT 
TIME, I REALLY JUST LEARNED A 
COUPLE OF THINGS. 
I KNOW FOR SURE THAT I HAVE 
SEEN THINGS. 
I HAVE SEEN FIGHTERS. 
DONALD TRUMP IS A FIGHTER. 
HE FIGHTS FOR AMERICA FIRST. 
-FIGHTS TO KEEP OUR BORDERS 
SECURE. 
HE FIGHTS FOR JOBS, HE FIGHTS 
FOR THOSE AT OR APPROACHING 
RETIREMENT. 
HE'S A FIGHTER AND WE'RE SO 
HONORED TO HAVE HIM HERE IN 
KANSAS. 
HE MOVED THE U.S. EMBASSY TO 
JERUSALEM. 
HE LIKES APPOINTING PRO 
CONSTITUTION JUDGES TO THE 
BENCH. 
AND HE IS TOUGH ON CHINA. 
IRAN. 
AND NORTH KOREA. 
GORSUCH AND KAVANAUGH. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU  MR. PRESIDENT. 
THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO 
FOR KANSAS. 
AND FOR AMERICA AND FOR THIS 
WORLD. 
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. 
THANK YOU SIR. 
>> A VOTE FOR STEVE IS A VOTE 
FOR ME AND OUR AGENDA TO MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
A VOTE FOR STEVE'S OPPONENT. 
HIS' NOT GOOD. 
HE'S NOT GOOD. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
IS A VOTE FOR A RADICAL AGENDA 
OF NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER. 
AND, THE LEGENDARY MAXINE 
WATERS. 
HERE IN KANSAS, HIS OPPONENT 
PAUL DAVIS VOTE TIME AND TIME 
TO RAISE YOUR TAXES AND VOTED 
TO GIVE PUBLIC BENEFITS TO 
ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
IF YOU WANT TO STOP NANCY 
PELOSI FROM BECOMING SPEAKER OF 
THE HOUSE, NANCY PELOSI? 
NANCY PELOSI. 
WHOA. 
YOU BETTER GET OUT AND VOTE FOR 
STEVE WATKINS, PLEASE. 
THE MAJORITY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE ALREADY SPONSORED A 
SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF HEALTH 
CARE. 
THE DEMOCRATS' PLAN WOULD 
DESTROY HEALTH CARE FOR 20 
MILLION SENIORS. 
WE WANT TO PROTECT MEDICARE. 
WE WILL AS REPUBLICANS PROTECT 
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS 
WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND PAID FOR 
IT. 
AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT 
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING 
CONDITIONS. 
WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT 
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING 
CONDITIONS. 
TODAY'S DEMOCRATS HAVE EMBRACED 
RADICALISM AND OPEN BORDERS. 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORDERS, YOU 
DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY FOLKS, YOU 
DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. 
EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT IN THE 
U.S. SENATE HAS SIGNED UP FOR 
THE OPEN BORDERS AND IT'S A 
BILL CALLED THE OPEN BORDERS 
BILL. 
WHAT'S GOING ON? 
AND IT'S WRITTEN BY, GUESS WHO? 
DIANE FEINSTEIN. 
REMEMBER THE LEAKING, RIGHT? 
THE LEAKING DIANE FEINSTEIN. 
DID YOU LEAK, DIANE? 
NO, NO, NO. 
NO. 
I DIDN'T. 
I DON'T THINK. 
WAIT. 
DID WE LEAK? 
NO, HE SAID NO. 
WE DIDN'T LEAK. 
OKAY. 
WAS THAT THE WORST BODY 
LANGUAGE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN? 
WAS THAT THE WORST? 
NO. 
I DIDN'T LEAK. 
NO, SHE DIDN'T LEAK. 
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DEALING 
WITH. 
IF THE DEMOCRATS' BILL BECOMES 
LAW, DRUGS AND CRIME WOULD POUR 
INTO YOUR NATION LIKE NEVER 
EVER BEFORE. 
DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORT DEADLY 
SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RELEASE 
VIOLENT PREDATORS AND BLOOD 
THIRSTY KILLERS LIKE MS-13 INTO 
OUR COMMUNITIES. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THIS SHOULD 
BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING 
AMERICANS. 
NOT CRIMINAL ILLEGALS. 
AND, REPUBLICANS STAND PROUDLY 
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
ICE. 
BORDER PATROL. 
AND LAW ENFOREMENT. 
THEY WANTED TO FUND ICE, CAN 
YOU BELIEVE THAT? 
WHEN MS-13 SEES ICE COMING THEY 
SAY LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. 
BUT THEY CAN'T. 
BECAUSE THEY GET CAUGHT. 
THEY GET THROWN OUT OF THE 
COUNTRY. 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO GET RID 
OF US. 
ICE ARE GREAT AMERICANS. 
THEY HAPPEN TO BE TOUGH PEOPLE. 
I THINK WE NEED SOME TOUGH 
PEOPLE. 
TOUGH! 
MS-13 DOESN'T LIKE ICE. 
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE ICE. 
BUT THEY'RE GREAT AMERICANS, 
THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND 
THEY'RE NOT TREATED PROPERLY. 
THEY GO INTO A COMMUNITY. 
I GREW UP IN THAT VICINITY. 
I KNOW EVERY COMMUNITY OUT 
THERE. 
THEY GO INTO THESE COMMUNITIES 
AND THESE ARE ROUGH, ROUGH 
PEOPLE. 
MS-13. 
HOW THEY EVEN COME IN, SO MANY 
PEOPLE BEFORE US. 
AND OUR LAWS ARE SO BAD. 
AND WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 
BUT THEY COME IN. 
AND, WE SEND ICE. 
AND THEY GET IN THERE AND THEY 
GET THEM OUT. 
IT'S LIKE WE'RE LIBERATING 
THEM. 
IT'S LIKE A WAR. 
A FOREIGN INVADER. 
A FOREIGN INVADER FINALLY IS 
BEING TAKEN OUT. 
THEY'RE LIBERATING THE COUNTRY, 
THE CITY OR THE TOWN. 
THESE PEOPLE ARE LIBERATING 
THESE TOWNS. 
YOU KNOW THE STORY, YOU'VE 
HEARD IT. 
THEY CUT PEOPLE UP BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T WANT TO USE GUNS BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT PAINFUL ENOUGH. 
AN WHEN THEY SAID ANIMALS. 
NANCY PELOSI SAID HOW DARE YOU 
SPEAK THAT WAY ABOUT A HUMAN 
BEING. 
THIS WOMAN JUST SAID IT TO ME. 
HOW DARE YOU CALL THEM. 
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS. 
THESE ARE ANIMALS, FOLKS. 
THESE ARE ANIMALS. 
AN WE NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 
ICE AND BORDER PATROL. 
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND IF YOUR COMMUNITY HAS A 
PROBLEM, DON'T WORRY. 
GIVE US A CALL. 
DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO FIGHTING TO 
GIVE WELFARE AND FREE HEALTH 
CARE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
PAID FOR BY YOU THE AMERICAN 
TAXPAYER. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT THE 
PUBLIC BENEFITS MUST BE 
PROTECTED FOR THE TRULY NEEDY 
AMERICANS. 
AMERICANS THAT NEED HELP. 
NOT ILLEGAL ALIENS. 
IF YOU WANT, SAY, IF YOU WANT A 
BORDER, IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO 
REMAIN A SOVEREIGN GREAT 
COUNTRY THEN ORGANIZE, 
MOBILIZE, REGISTER AND VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES. 
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SAFETY. 
AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT PROSPERITY. 
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE 
CREATED OVER 4.2 MILLION NEW 
JOBS AND LIFTED ALMOST 4 
MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD 
STAMPS. 
AND WE HADED NEARLY ONE-HALF 
MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
HAVE I EVER SAID THAT? 
LOOK HOW MANY. 
OH MAN. 
YOU ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE 
PEOPLE. 
LOOK HOW MANY REPORTERS. 
LOOK. 
THAT'S A LOT. 
WOW. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I CALL IT? 
I CALL IT THE ACADEMY AWARDS. 
THAT'S THE ACADEMY AWARDS. 
OUR POLLS CAME OUT. 
THEY NEVER REPORT THAT. 
THEY NEVER DO. 
AND IT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. 
THEY SAY WHEN THEY DON'T WANT 
TO TALK ABOUT IT, THAT MEANS 
THEY'RE VOTING FOR TRUMP. 
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE THRILLED? 
BUT WE'LL TAKE IT, RIGHT? 
WE'LL TAKE IT. 
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT IT. 
AND, OKAY. 
BUT NOW, THEY LEARNED. 
THEY LEARNED THEIR LESSON. 
WHEN THEY DON'T TALK, THEY'RE 
TRUMP VOTERS. 
ALL ACTION. 
ALL ACTION. 
NO TALK. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 
RECORDED HISTORY. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS 
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER 
RECORDED. 
BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE DURING THE 
DEBATE, THE BEST UNEMPLOYMENT 
NUMBER EVER FOR AFRICAN-
AMERICANS, BEST IN TERMS OF 
POVERTY EVER IN HISTORY FOR 
AFRICAN-AMERICANS? 
HOW DO YOU WIN? 
HOW DO YOU BEAT US ON THAT? 
IT'S ONLY HABIT. 
BECAUSE FOR 100 YEARS, AFRICAN-
AMERICANS HAVE GONE WITH 
DEMOCRATS. 
BUT NOW, THEY'RE CHANGING AND 
THEY'RE CHANGING FAST. 
THANK YOU KANYE WEST. 
THANK YOU JIM BROWN. 
THANK YOU IRON MIKE. 
I WOULD GO THROUGH, WE HAVE SO 
MANY PEOPLE. 
BIG JIM. 
WE COULD USE HIM RIGHT NOW IN 
THE NFL. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN AND ASIAN 
AMERICAN. 
LIKE WISE, THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATES HAVE REACHED ALL TIME 
HISTORIC LOWS. 
THE LOWEST. 
AND WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT JUST 
FELL TO 3.6%. 
THE LOWEST RATE IN 65 YEARS. 
AND WE ARE AS OF RIGHT NOW, THE 
NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CRUDE 
OIL AND NATURAL GAS. 
ENERGY.
NUMBER ONE. 
AND SINCE I TOOK OFFICE, THE 
VALUE OF AMERICAN'S MUTUAL 
FUDS AND PENSION FUNDS HAS 
INCREASED BY $2.7 TRILLION. 
AND YOUR 401Ks , YOU LOOK LIKE 
A BUNCH OF GENIUSES. 
THANK YOU DONALD. 
YOU'RE ALL GREAT INVESTORS. 
RIGHT? 
YOU'RE ALL GREAT INVESTORS, 
THAT'S OKAY. 
WE PICKED UP 11. 
I WOULD SAY 10. 
I WAS SAYING 7. WE PICKED UP 
NOW 11.7. 
LARRY KUDLOW SAID IT TO ME THE 
OTHER DAY. 
HE SAID SIR YOU'RE A LITTLE 
LOWER. 
I SAID REALLY? 
IT'S NOW $11.7 TRILLION IN 
WORTH. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? 
AND CHINA WAS CATCHING US 
RAPIDLY BEFORE I BECAME 
PRESIDENT. 
WE ARE THE FASTEST DEVELOPING 
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. 
FASTEST IN THE WORLD. 
AND THAT'S WHY I SAY WE HAVE A 
MIDTERM COMING UP. 
HISTORICALLY, WHO EVER IS 
PRESIDENT. 
I GUESS PEOPLE GET COMPLACENT. 
THEY ARE COMPLACENT. 
THEN WE ALWAYS WIN IN THE NEXT 
ONE WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW, THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO 
SLEEP, SOMETIMES, WHILE I'M 
SLEEPING I LOVE THEM SO. 
CORY BOOKER. 
POCAHONTAS. 
I'VE GOT MORE INDIAN BLOOD IN 
ME THAN POCAHONTAS AND I HAVE 
NONE. 
SADLY. 
I HAVE NONE. 
BUT I HAVE MORE THAN SHE DOES. 
THEY SAID TO HER WHY DO YOU SAY 
YOU'RE OF INDIAN HERITAGE? 
MY MOTHER SAID I HAD HIGH 
CHEEKBONES. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOCUMENTATION? 
NO WE DON'T. 
WELL I HAVE HIGH CHEEKBONES 
TOO. 
HEY, MAYBE I'M AND INDIAN. 
AND I'M GOING TO DO VERY WELL. 
BUT THINK OF IT. 
THIS IS HER REASON. 
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE CAREFUL. 
I'M TAKING OUT SO MANY OF THESE 
PEOPLE. 
I'M HITTING THEM SO HARD, 
THEY'RE DISAPPEARING AND I 
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. 
I MAY GET SOMEBODY THAT'S GOOD 
TO RUN AGAINST ME AND THAT 
WOULD NOT BE GOOD. 
I'LL TAKE OUT ALL THE EASY ONES 
AN MAYBE I'LL GET STUCK WITH 
SOMEBODY WHO IS ACTUALLY GOOD. 
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY ON THAT 
SIDE. 
WELL, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN WHO RAN 
FOR PRESIDENT TWO OR THREE 
TIMES, YOU KNOW. 
I THINK I REMEMBER A THIRD TIME 
IN THERE. 
BUT HE HAD 1% WITH AN ARROW 
POINTING LEFT. 
THEN OBAMA TOOK HIM OFF THE 
TRASH HEAP. 
WELL HE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE. 
REMEMBER, HE CHALLENGED ME TO A 
FIGHT. 
I'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM BEHIND THE 
BARN. 
I'D LOVE THAT. 
THAT WOULDN'T LAST LONG. 
THAT WOULD NOT LAST LONG. 
THAT WOULDN'T LAST LONG. 
HE'S DOWN AND NEVER GET UP. 
HE WILL NEVER GET UP. 
NO, I HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR 
CANDIDATES ALONE. 
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY SAID YOU HIT 
THESE CANDIDATES REALLY HARD. 
THERE'S A NONCANDIDATE YOU 
KNOW. 
BLOOMENTHOL. 
HE SAID WHEN I WAS IN THE 
DONANG PROVINCE IN VIETNAM AND 
MEN WERE GOING LEFT AND RIGHT 
OF ME, THEY'RE DYING. 
BEING STRUCK BY BULLETS BUT I 
WENT BACK TO THEIR RESCUE. 
I WENT BACK AND I GOT THEM. 
AND THEN I MADE A SECOND 
ATTEMPT. 
AND BULLETS ARE GOING LEFT AND 
RIGHT AND OVER MY SHOULDERS AND 
THEY'RE HITTING MY MEN. 
AND I USED TO THINK, WOW, 
THAT'S A PRETTY GREAT GUY. 
THEN I FOUND OUT HE'S A FRAUD. 
HE NEVER WAS IN VIETNAM. 
AND HE STOPPED CAMPAIGNING 
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY HE 
COULD WIN. 
NO WAY. 
AND BECAUSE IT'S CONNECTICUT, 
WHERE, I GUESS, ONLY A 
DEMOCRAT, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? 
THAT'S WHY CONNECTICUT'S SUCH A 
MESS RIGHT NOW. 
ONLY A DEMOCRAT, IT'S A MESS. 
GENERAL ELECTORATE JUST MOVED 
OUT. 
THAT DOESN'T HELP. 
THEN I SEE HIM TALKING ABOUT A 
MAN WHO IS NUMBER ONE IN YALE. 
WHO HAS A PERFECT RECORD. 
THE MOST INCREDIBLE RECORD. 
ONE OF THE REASONS I PICKED 
HIM. 
HE'S LIKE A PERFECT PERSON. 
AND DA NANG DICK WHO SAID HE 
WAS A GREAT WAR HERO AND HE 
NEVER SAW THE COUNTRY. 
THIS WASN'T LIKE SAYING YEAH, I 
WAS IN THE ARMY. 
THIS IS DA NANG. 
HE'S TAKING BULLETS LEFT AND 
RIGHT. 
AND HE NEVER SAW THE PLACE. 
HE WAS IN THE RESERVES. 
I DEMAND HONESTY, INTEGRITY. 
THAT'S THE GUY THAT LIED. HOW 
BAD. 
YOU DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE IN 
OFFICE. 
AND COMPARE THAT WITH WHAT YOU 
HAVE SEEN WITH JOHN CORNEN WHO 
ASKED THAT QUESTION TO DIANE 
FEINSTEIN. 
AND, LINDSAY GRAHAM WHO DID 
SUCH A GREAT JOB. 
HOW GOOD WAS LINDSEY? 
HOW GOOD WAS LINDSEY? 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
HE WAS SPEAKING FROM THE HEART. 
BY THE WAY, IT TOOK A WEEK, BUT 
THE EXTRA WEEK WAS A GREAT 
THING. 
BECAUSE IT SHOWED NO 
CORROBORATION. 
NO NOTHING. 
BY THE WAY, NO NOTHING. 
NO NOTHING. 
HOW GOOD WAS SENATOR SUSAN 
COLLINS? 
REALLY GOOD. 
REALLY GOOD. 
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY. 
I TELL YOU WHAT. 
CHUCK WAS GREAT. 
HE'S GOT TO BE VERY HAPPY WITH 
WHAT WE DID. 
GREAT CHUCK FROM IOWA. 
GREAT STATE. 
AND MITCH MCCONNELL. 
HOW GOOD? 
HOW GOOD? 
HE WAS GREAT. 
HE WORKED HARD. 
AND WE GOT OURSELVES THE FINEST 
LEGAL MIND. 
ONE OF THE FINEST HUMAN BEINGS. 
AND HA HIS FAMILY TOOK, THE 
HORROR THEY HAD TO ENDURE BY 
THESE PEOPLE LIKE BLUMENTHAL 
AND CORY BOOKER WHO WAS A 
DISASTER AS THE MAYOR. 
WHAT THEY HAD TO TAKE WAS A 
DISGRACE. 
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE 
DEMOCRAT IS IF YOU'RE TIRED OF 
WINNING. 
RIGHT? 
TIRED OF WINNING. 
WE WANT TO WIN, WIN, WIN. 
NEVER GET TIRED OF IT. 
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER 
NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY 
REBUILDING OUR NATION, YOU SEE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
AND I JUST LEFT THE UNITED 
NATIONS LAST WEEK AND I CAN 
TELL YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE CAN 
TELL YOU AND EVEN THE FAKE NEWS 
CAN TELL YOU, AMERICA IS 
RESPECTED AGAIN. 
THE CREATE MORE JOBS AND RISING 
WAGES. 
REPUBLICANS PASS THE BIGGEST 
PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS 
IN AMERICAN HISTORY BY FAR. 
WE ALSO PASS VETERAN'S CHOICE. 
44 YEARS. 
GIVE OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT TO 
SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR. 
AND WE PAY FOR IT. 
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN 
LINE FOR 25 DAYS. 
38 DAYS. 
14 DAYS. 
SIX DAYS. 
THEY GO OUT AND THEY SEE A 
PRIVATE DOCTOR. 
THEY GET THEMSELVES A GOOD 
DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL. 
IT'S FRANKLY SO SIMPLE BUT IT 
TOOK 44 YEARS TO GET IT DONE. 
AND WE ALSO PASSED, THIS IS 45 
YEARS. 
THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY LAW TO 
ENSURE ANYONE WHO MISTREATS OUR 
VETERANS WILL BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
YOU ARE FIRED. 
GET OUT. 
AND, WE SECURED A RECORD $700 
BILLION AND THE NEXT YEAR, $716 
BILLION TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY 
AND TO GIVE OUR BRAVE WARRIORS 
THEIR LARGEST PAY PRAISE IN 
ALMOST A DECADE. 
AND UNDER MY DIRECTION, THE 
PENTAGON IS NOW WORKING TO 
CREATE THE SIXTH BRANCH OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. 
THE SPACE FORCE. 
WE'RE VERY SERIOUS. 
AND IT'S HAPPENING QUICKLY. 
VERY SERIOUS. 
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE IT'S AT. 
DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT, BUT IT'S 
RIGHT. 
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 
BOTH DEFENSE AND OPENS IS WHERE 
IT'S AT. 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE SIDED 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. 
BEFORE I CAME PRESIDENT, THEY 
WERE TAKING OVER THE MIDDLE 
EAST. 
THEY WERE TAKING SYRIA, YEMEN. 
THEY WERE TAKING EVERYTHING. 
SINCE I TOOK OVER, THAT 
OPERATION, THAT HORRIBLE, 
HORRIBLE DEAL THAT WAS, THINK 
OF IT. 
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 
GAVE IRAN $150 MILLION. 
AND EVEN CRAZIER, THEY GAVE HIM 
$1.8 BILLION IN CASH. 
CASH. 
AIRPLANES FULL OF CASH. 
IN FACT, I GOT IN. 
I SAID, DOES THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY HAVE 
THE POWER TO GIVE AWAY $1.8 
BILLION IN CASH? 
THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY NO, THEY 
DON'T. 
WHAT THEY DID THERE IS A 
DISGRACE. 
THEY GAVE HIM 1.8 IN ORDER TO 
HAVE A TERRIBLE DEAL. 
WELL, THAT WAS A HOSTAGE. 
THEY PAID A BILLION EIGHT FOR 
HOSTAGES. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 
AND WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK 
FROM NORTH KOREA. 
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. 
BUT I THINK GOOD THINGS HAPPEN. 
NO MORE MISSILE TESTING. 
NO MORE ROCKET TESTING. 
NO MORE NUCLEAR TESTING. 
WE GOT THE REMAINS OF OUR 
GREAT, GREAT HEROS FROM 75 
YEARS AGO BACK. 
AND THEY KEEP COMING. 
AND, WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 
AND GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. 
YOU KNOW? 
JUST BEFORE WE SIGN THE DEAL 
WITH CANADA AND MEXICO. 
WHO KNOWS. 
IT'S A DEAL. 
WHO KNOWS? 
I LIKE IT. 
IT TAKES TALL PRESSURE OFF. 
WHO KNOWS? 
WHO KNOWS? 
BUT I THINK WE'RE DOING VERY 
WELL. 
THE FAKE NEWS SAYS WHY AREN'T 
YOU GOING FASTER? 
LISTEN, I JUST GOT BACK THREE 
MONTHS AGO. 
I WAS THERE WITH KIM JONG UN. 
I WAS THERE THREE MONTHS AGO, 
CHAIRMAN KIM. 
THEY SAID WHY AREN'T YOU GOING 
FASTER? 
I SAID WHAT HAVE PEOPLE DONE 
FOR 75 YEARS? 
THIS IS THREE MONTHS. 
ONE OF THE ANCHORS SAID WHY HAS 
THE PRESIDENT GIVEN AWAY SO 
MUCH? 
WHAT HAVE I GIVEN? 
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING. 
WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 
FOR NOTHING. 
OUT OF RESPECT. 
THE TESTING ALL STOPPED. 
THE NUCLEAR TESTING. 
I SAID TELL ME. 
WHAT HAVE I GIVEN? 
WELL, YOU AGREED TO MEET. 
THAT DIDN'T COST ME VERY MUCH. 
I GET TO MEET. 
I LIKE TO MEET. 
WHAT DO WE LOSE BY MEETING? 
I ASKED THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
I AGREED TO MEET. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW WELL WE 
WOULD DO IF WE HAD FAIR PRESS? 
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 
INSTEAD OF FAKE NEWS. 
I AGREED TO MEET. 
I'M SORRY. 
I AGREED TO MEET. 
THEN THEY SAID THAT YOU KNOW 
THE RHETORIC WAS EXTREMELY 
TOUGH THAT FIRST COUPLE OF 
MONTHS. 
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID AT MY 
MEETING WITH HIM. 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE BY 
FAR IS NORTH KOREA. 
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO WAR. 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. 
AND I SAID TO SOMEBODY IN THEIR 
ADMINISTRATION, HAVE YOU EVER 
TALKED? 
HAVE YOU EVER AGREED TO MEET? 
WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT. 
WE'LL MEET ANYBODY. 
BUT WE HAVE THEM COMING IN. 
IT'S THE GREATEST POWER WE EVER 
HAD. 
GREATEST POWER IN THE WORLD. 
716MILLION. 
GREATEST POWER IN THE WORLD. 
BUT WE'RE DOING GREAT. 
AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPENED 
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN 
JERUSALEM. 
THAT'S THE OTHER STORY. 
THAT'S THE OTHER STORY WE TELL. 
THAT'S A BIG ONE. 
THAT'S A BIG, BIG STORY. 
YOU KNOW WHY? 
BECAUSE, OTHER PRESIDENTS ALL 
SAID, MANY, MANY PRESIDENTS. 
WE'LL DO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO 
DO. 
THEN THE PRESSURE IS ON AND 
THEY DON'T DO IT. 
I SEE WHY. 
I DON'T BLAME THEM. 
THEY SAY DON'T DO IT. 
PLEASE DON'T DO IT. 
DON'T DO IT. 
YOU KNOW THE STORY. 
TELL THEM I'LL CALL THEM BACK 
THURSDAY. 
NEXT WEEK, WEDNESDAY. 
TELL THEM I'M CALLING THEM BACK 
ON THURSDAY. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH 
THEM. 
THEN I SIGN THE DEAL. 
THEN I CALL THEM BACK. 
HI, HOW YOU DOING? 
WHAT'S UP? 
WOW. 
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 
ISRAEL. 
BUT IT'S A LITTLE LATE. 
AND THE OTHER THING THAT WAS 
GOING TO CAUSE OVER A BILLION 
DOLLARS, WE BUILT IT FOR ABOUT 
400,000. 
IT WOULDWE TOOK A PIECE OF LAND 
WE ALREADY OWN. 
WE FIXED THE BUILDING UP A 
LITTLE MORE. 
WE USED EVEN JERUSALEM STONE. 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL. 
HOW NICE IS THAT? 
AND YOU KNOW, JERUSALEM STONE 
IN JERUSALEM SOUNDS ABOUT 
RIGHT. 
AND WE GOT IT FOR THE RIGHT 
PRICE. 
AND WE BUILT IT FOR LESS THAN 
$500,000. 
THINK OF THAT. 
AND IT'S OPEN NOW. 
WE HAVE OUR EMBASSY. 
SO WE SAVED A BILLION DOLLARS 
IN 20 YEARS. 
WE COULD DO THAT WITH HUNDREDS 
OF THEM. 
FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 
AND NOW, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT 
WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES. 
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR KANSAS. 
WE'RE STANDING PROUDLY FOR OUR 
GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
RIGHT? 
AND I JUST HOPE CANADA AND THE 
NFL MAKE THE DEAL THEY HAVE 
BEEN TRYING TO MAKE FOR YEARS. 
CANADA WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 
THE NFL. 
IT TOOK ME TWO SECOND. 
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY, BUT NOT 
COMPARED TO CORN AND CROPS AND 
DAIRY AND MILK AND CARS AND 
STEEL AND EVERYTHING ELSE. 
IT'S PEANUTS. 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. 
BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP AMERICAN 
COMPANIES. 
IT TOOK ME LIKE TWO MINUTES. 
AND I GOT A CALL FROM THE 
COMMISSIONER OF THE NFL AND I 
THOUGHT HE WAS CALLING ME TO 
ASK ME TO STOP HAUNTING THEM 
ABOUT STANDING FOR THE AMERICAN 
FLAG AND FOR OUR NATION. 
AND HE DIDN'T. 
HE CALLED ME TO THANK ME. 
HE SAID THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION COULD NOT GET 
INDONE. 
YOU GOT IT DONE. 
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE 
TRYING TO DO IT. 
SO NOW THEY'LL HAVE A LOT MORE 
MONEY TO GIVE TO THEIR PLAYERS 
AND THEIR PLAYERS WILL STILL 
HATE ME. 
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 
JUST AS LONG AS THEY STAND FOR 
OUR FLAG. 
AND OUR ANTHEM. 
I DON'T CARE HOW THEY FEEL 
ABOUT IT. 
BUT, TO CONTINUE OUR INCREDIBLE 
MOMENT. 
YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, 
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COWORKERS, 
GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
WE NEED MORE PEOPLE. 
VOTE TO SEND KRIS KOBACH TO THE 
GOVERNOR'S MANSION AND VOTE TO 
SEND STEVE WATKINS TO CONGRESS. 
ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE FOR LOWER TAXES. 
LESS REGULATION. 
AND MORE PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT 
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
FINALLY. 
FINALLY. 
WE WANT IT MADE HERE. 
IT'S A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR 
BORDERS AND RESPECT OUR 
CONSTITUTION AND RESPECT THE 
HEROS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. 
THEY'RE OUR HEROS. 
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS 
TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT POLITICS 
OF ANGER AND DIVISION AND 
DISRUPTION AND RECLAIM 
AMERICA'S TRUE HERITAGE AND 
RIGHTEOUS DESTINY. 
WE'RE LOSING THAT WITH THESE 
CRAZY LOCO PEOPLE. 
TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM 
TONIGHT. 
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
TO EVERY CITIZEN WATCHING 
ACROSS OUR LAND. 
THIS IS YOUR TIME TO CHOOSE. 
IT'S A TIME TO CHOOSE WHETHER 
WE TURN BACKWARD TO THE FAILURE 
AND FRUSTRATION OF THE PAST. 
OR WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD 
INTO A FUTURE OF AMERICAN 
GREATNESS. 
IT'S NOT UP TO THE MEDIA. 
IT'S NOT UP TO THE PUN DIDN'TS. 
IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE YOUR 
FAITH. 
AND REMEMBER THIS. 
WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016 AND 
WHAT'S HAPPENING EVEN MORE SO 
NOW I BELIEVE. 
ONE OF THEM SAID HE MADE A LOT 
OF PROMISES AND HE ACTUALLY 
PRODUCED MORE THAN HE MADE 
PROMISES. I 
DID. 
YOU HAVE THE POWER WITH YOUR 
VOTE TO DEFEND YOUR FAMILY, 
YOUR COMMUNITY, YOUR COUNTRY. 
AND EVERYTHING WE HOLD SACRED 
AND RIGHTEOUS AND TRUE. 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND 
TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK 
OUR COUNTRY. 
RETURNING POWER TO EVERY DAY 
GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOTS. 
THE STATE OF KANSAS WAS SETTLED 
BY TOUGH PIONEER MEN. 
AND STRONG WOMEN. 
WHO DEFIED DANGER AND BRAVED 
THE WILDERNESS TO BUILD A 
BEAUTIFUL LIFE ON THE PLAINS. 
BEAUTIFUL. 
BEAUTIFUL. 
BEAUTIFUL. 
STRONG WOMEN. 
STRONG WOMEN. 
STRONG WOMEN. 
I'M SORRY FELLOWS. 
STRONGER THAN THE MEN. 
I'M SORRY FELLOWS. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY. 
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON. 
THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILIES. 
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY. 
AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD. 
THESE COURAGEOUS PATRIOTS DID 
NOT SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, 
AND TEARS SO WE COULD SIT AT 
HOME WHILE OTHERS TRY TO ERASE 
THEIR LEGACY AND DESTROY THEIR 
PROUD AND GREAT AMERICAN 
HERITAGE FOR THE SAKE OF OUR 
FREEDOM AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR 
CHILDREN, WE ARE GOING TO WORK, 
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT AND WE 
ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN. 
WE WILL NOT BEND. 
WE WILL NOT BREAK. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP AND BACK 
DOWN. 
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER AND WE 
WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ONTO VICTORY. 
WE ARE AMERICAN AND OUR HEARTS 
BLEED RED, WHITE, AND BLUE. 
ONE PEOPLE. 
ONE FAMILY. 
ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU KANSAS. 
THANK YOU! 
[ YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU 
WANT PLAYS ] 
>> THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 
TOPEKA KANSAS JUST WRAPPING UP 
A CAMPAIGN STYLE RALLY. 
IT DOUBLED AS A VICTORY EVENT 
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THIS AFTERNOON, THE SENATE 
CONFIRMED BRETT KAVANAUGH TO 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
A LOT MORE NEWS AHEAD. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
ALWAYS ON. 
WE'RE BACK AFTER A BREAK. 
THIS IS CBSN. 
ALWAYS ON.
