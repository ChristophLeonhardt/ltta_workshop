I like to think I'm not the sort of person who becomes bitter at this success of my friends but when I've suffered an injustice I feel compelled to speak out the other day my daily wire colleagues ben shapiro and michael knowles were both called hateful by the Southern Poverty Law Center for some reason I was overlooked now again it's not jealousy that motivates me here it's a simple sense of fair play I think anyone who has listened to this podcast without prejudice will agree that I am every bit as hateful to the Southern Poverty Law Center as Shapiro or Knowles after all I support freedom in the Constitution as much as they do I reject intersectionality and racial victim mongering as much as they do and I believe in God and country every bit as much as they do I am hateful dammit and I deserve to be recognized for my hatefulness by the Southern Poverty Law Center just as much as any other God loving freedom loving Patriot I'm not trying to take anything away from Ben and Michael but I'm asking you today to contact the Southern Poverty Law Center through their hate report hotline at SPL center.org slash report hate and demand that I be given my fair do as a non racist freedom loving god-fearing American I am as hateful to the Southern Poverty Law Center as anyone alive and I deserve that recognition again that's SPL center.org slash report hate write today hashtag call clayvin hateful
