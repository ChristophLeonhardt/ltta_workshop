1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,230
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has
become a symbol of everything the Republican

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,860
party stands against.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,640
Everyone gets a right to basic healthcare.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,080
We need strong oversight of these banks.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,660
A legal scholar, and a consumer advocate
turned politician, Warren has branded herself

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,439
as a champion of the working class and made
a career out of standing up to big business.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,380
While rumors of a 2020 presidency bid remain
just that...

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,080
I’m not running for President.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,960
Her Senate seat is up for reelection in 2018,
and Republicans are already pumping millions

10
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,100
into SuperPacs to defeat her.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,050
This is the story of how a law professor and
politician came to be seen as the biggest

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,900
threat to Republican values, and the greatest
hope for progressive America.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,260
Elizabeth Warren was born Elizabeth Anne Herrin,
the youngest of three siblings on June 22,

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,220
1949, in Oklahoma City to middle class parents.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,720
After waiting tables to help her family pay
the bills, Warren became a star on the

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,220
high school debate team.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,559
She landed a scholarship to George Washington
University at the age of 16,

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,780
but two years later dropped out to marry her high school
sweetheart, Jim Warren.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,560
By 1980 Warren was a mother of two, divorced
and remarried, had earned a bachelor’s degree

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,140
from the University of Houston, a Juris Degree
from Rutgers and was practicing law in New Jersey.

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,740
Warren then went on to become an influential
law professor, teaching lecturing and publishing

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,670
highly cited work on bankruptcy and commercial
law at seven universities around the country,

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,950
eventually settling at Harvard Law School.

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,140
But Warren wasn't always a liberal lion.

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,970
Elizabeth Warren used to be a Republican actually.

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,400
That’s Steven Dennis.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
I’m a Senate reporter for Bloomberg.

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,560
Around the time Elizabeth Warren switched
parties she became a fierce opponent of a

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,880
Republican drive to make it much harder to
file for bankruptcy.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,180
She fought that for a decade, it ended up
passing anyway.

31
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,220
While her efforts ultimately failed, her warning
calls were heard in 2008.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,900
We’re in the midst of a serious financial
crisis. Our entire economy is in danger.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,920
Without immediate action by congress, America
could slip into a financial panic

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,780
and a distressing scenario would unfold.

35
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Professor Warren was tapped to help with oversight
in the government bailout.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,980
She would excoriate bankers and their bonuses
and their practices.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,740
Why should the US taxpayer alone carry Citi?

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,340
She proposed a series of tough regulations
which became the basis for much of the

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,840
Dodd Frank financial law that we have today.

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,920
That sort of catapulted her to national stardom,
particularly among the progressive left.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,080
Encouraged by her newfound noteriaty, Warren
declared her bid for the US Senate on on September 14, 2011.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,480
During the race her opponent Scott Brown tried
to derail Warren by accusing her of falsely

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,720
claiming Native American heritage, a controversy
that earned her the nickname “Pocahontas”.

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,920
Nevertheless she was victorious and won the
senate seat by a comfortable margin.

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,640
She used her new tenure to challenge everyone
from banking regulators and treasury officials,

46
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,450
to members of Wall Street and Congress.

47
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,890
I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail'
has become 'too big for trial'.

48
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,159
We need tough new laws to hold corporate executives
personally accountable.

49
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,909
No one should be above the law.

50
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,420
She called for Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf
to resign for fraud, introduced the Bank on

51
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,400
Student Loans Fairness Act, and re-introduced
the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act.

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,920
In 2016, after staying silent during the primary
battle between Sanders and Clinton, Warren

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,160
finally endorsed Hillary Clinton, and had
some harsh words for candidate Trump.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:03,280
Donald Trump is a loud nasty thin skinned
fraud who has never risked anything for anyone

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,920
and that is just one of the many reasons he
will never be President of the United States.

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,120
But she was wrong.

57
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,200
The forgotten men and women of our country
will be forgotten no longer.

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,840
Warren wasted no time resisting Trump’s
agenda.

59
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,990
Have you ever managed or overseen a trillion
dollar loan program?

60
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,990
I have not.

61
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,900
How about a billion dollar loan program?

62
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,460
I have not.

63
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,220
In the Donald Trump era Elizabeth Warren has
been playing defense, and trying to prevent

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,240
Donald Trump and his cabinet appointees from
rolling back protections that she helped enact.

65
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,000
Warren actually found herself rebuked by Mitch
McConnell for reading a letter by Coretta

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Scott King about Jeff Session’s record on
racism during his confirmation.

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,280
She was warned.

68
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,470
She was given an explanation.

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,020
Nevertheless, she persisted…

70
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,320
That moment became something that’s on T-shirts,
bumper stickers, slogans, and that really

71
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,040
galvanized a lot of support for her.

72
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,490
It’s been really hard for Republicans to
get much of anything done this year, and that’s

73
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,660
at least in part to this resistance movement
that Elizabeth Warren has helped champion.

74
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,880
We are here to fight back!

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Millions of dollars are being funneled to
defeat Warren in the midterm elections in 2018.

76
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,840
But it's the rumors of 2020 presidential bid
that has further prompted powerful donors

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,000
to fund her opposition often using the same
playbook of constant and ruthless ad campaigns

78
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,470
that many believe helped Trump win in 2016.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,560
It’s anyone’s guess if she will endure
what Hillary could not.

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,760
You know the question for Elizabeth Warren
is whether she can go from being a liberal

81
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,480
firebrand, to somebody who can regularly get
60 votes for initiatives in the Senate and

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,680
218 in the House and drive an agenda, and
whether she can bring together

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,800
coalitions for political victories.

84
00:06:02,800 --> 00:00:00,000
That’s the challenge and we’ll see what
happens.
