it's going to be the biggest election in
Mexican history with positions up for
grabs from Mexico City Mayor to
congressional seats to the top job
itself and all eyes are on the three
main contenders for the presidency but
who are they the current frontrunner is
familiar to all Mexicans at least this
is the third bid by Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador he's a traditional leftist
who wants to raise public workers
salaries increase benefits for
vulnerable Mexicans and worryingly for
some hope the current government's
reforms to the struggling education and
energy sectors but most of all I am
committed to eliminating corruption and
impunity privileges and exemptions will
be abolished we will put an end to
luxuries abuses and overspending in the
government but that cries less
convincing this time round he's allied
himself with some dubious trade union
leaders and politicians in the hope of
widening his support hard on the heels
of the veteran and ambitious youngster
Ricardo Anaya
is all about slick promotional videos
and Steve Jobs style speeches the
conservative candidates fronting a
left-right alliance his main proposals a
universal income for all paid for by
cutting social programs
he's a moderniser but so far short on
detail el camino esta claro primero
the way is clear first sustained
economic development based on being more
competitive attractive to investment
which in turn will be invested in
education health and infrastructure this
has to defend himself against corruption
accusations which he says her a smear
campaign from the team of this man
third-placed Jose Antonio Meade
seen as a competent technocrat he's
banking on his government experienced
with votes we can look Mexicans in the
eye and talk about 20 years of public
service with 20 years of honorable
promotions 20 years of being part of a
team
but he's seen as lacking charisma and is
being dragged down by running for a
ruling party which has failed to curb
corruption or deal with what is the
elephant in the room for everyone and
that's Mexico's ongoing violence none of
the candidates have offered much detail
on how they'll tackle it
they're more keen to focus on other
things that spells trouble
the current administration had the same
approach and today we're seeing record
murder levels the candidates are on the
other hand more than willing to confront
this man and his planned wall
a furious Mexican public demands it but
they're also showing some restraint in
the end one of them is going to have to
work with the neighbor to the north John
