Kanye West has called Emma Gonzalez his hero but instead of referring back to him she has instead referred to James Shaw jr. the hero of the Waffle House shooting instead so recently we have these tweets from Kanye himself he has been going on a fun media blitz but recently he tweeted my hero Emma Gonzalez with a picture of her followed by inspired by Emma shaved his head took me a while to get that one and then Emma's response James Shaw jr. who actually I would describe strongly as a hero I did a facebook video on this recently but James Shaw James Shaw jr. is the one who stopped the gunman of the recent Waffle House shooting with his bare hands a good way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with no gun and he has not been acknowledged by Trump at all which I would think I would categorize this as epic levels of cowardice because James doesn't seem to fit into current narratives of civilians needing automatic rifles or white supremacists not being normalized is that the word and I would call this man a bona fide hero and I agree with her there's no question about it I mean it was a great response there's no question about it he's a hero who really as you say hasn't been recognized at the highest levels the way normally leadership in the case of this president president Trump normally likes to sort of wrap himself around heroic messages but I think Kim's right I mean this guy doesn't fit a lot of the narrative that this administration is about and as a result this story goes orphaned at least in terms of being recognized as a hero but yeah Emma really did I mean when you look at Emma and James they're both people who are similar to each other and that they're standing up for a Cause that isn't completely narcissistic I think Kanye sees a lot of himself in Trump because well I did listen to his two songs that he released this weekend not the one that goes poopa Dscoop but the other one in which he says Obama heaven-sent but trump proved that i could be president he sees himself as an outsider like him because he has constantly tried to get acknowledged by people with power and fame like if I think he's done songs about not being recognized by the fashion industry but also you'll remember President Obama epically denied him a relationship he called him a jackass he never took him seriously and he's complained a lot about him and his wife not being taken seriously and I think he sees himself in Trump I think easiest way of just never to be taken seriously by anyone except for bad faith political actors like those at Fox News is to tweet out consecutive rants about how the Democrats actually created the KKK and that the Republicans were the ones who were responsible for the slaves being freed completely discounting you know like the last 40 to 50 years of history it's absolutely absurd that this person a 40 year old man is only just learning about you know American history and and the fact that he's talking about how the the tired old dinesh d'souza tropes of how Democrats are the true racist ones and remember the KKK was created by the Democrats like all of these insane things is mind-boggling to me and I'm a very outspoken Kanye advocate I even went up against jank on Twitter and I was like you're wrong Kanye's musical savant and like he's just doing this to sell albums and now I feel terrible because I think he might secretly be a marketing or comedy genius I'm not sure it's very hard to tell well he's definitely a market he's definitely a marketing wizard but you know they do Trump and Kanye share something right there are both empty vessels as you say he's just now hearing all this stuff that he's regurgitating it's just being fed to him you know everything from slavery to to to whatever I mean the civil rights and yeah I mean literally he has no sense of of anything that's not related to him this is completely beside the music now we're talking about the political forums so and he's got the fame that Trump had right so he's the tea vessel and the fame so in that sense he is like Trump I mean trumping here kissing cousins I don't know that he's empty cuz I know at least at one time he created art that really inspired people and at this point I think he's been famous for so long he's gotten kind of isolated and insular he doesn't take constructive criticism he he views it as like a tax to him very much like President Trump and I think over time his grip on on things that are real to people has loosened I mean it's it almost feels like he thinks that classicism is the same as racism at this point and it's not one thing I wanted to say is that Kanye's like performative Lee trying to be a centrist now which is one of the most annoying type of people that you can be on the internet the whole both sides are bad but both sides are also good we should love one another argument kind of falls the pieces when one side is literally advocating for you know ethnic cleansing or an F no state we saw that happen with Donald Trump trying to defend Nazis at Charlottesville and Kanye West is doing that and the reason why I think it's performative is because while he is consistently blasting out misinformation about the Democrats he then follows that up with this like very performative photo of Emma Gonzales saying Emma Gonzales is my hero but well and then not really following that up with any sort of liberal principles or any sort of democratic principles there was something from one of the text messages he got earlier today was about how socialism is so terrible for the world that you would have to be intellectually dishonest not to see it it's all all right red pill Magda bullshit coated with a little bit of performative woek nasaan the side to bring back liberals or maybe to anger conservatives by posting a photo of Emma Gonzales it's really not clear what he's doing because on one hand he's doing this pro Tom Trump mugga stuff and then Emma like picking up all right followers dropping out right followers i I don't know what he's doing so that leads me to think maybe he's just doing this for attention it wouldn't be crazy everything kinda does is for attention everything he does is for Kanye and he admits and that's very similar to Donald Trump and it just said that I mean we cover identity politics a lot on the show and you know I have this conversation my black friends all the time it's like being a black American is identity politics like everything you do is somewhat political and I understand just like chance the rapper even said like you can be black and a conservative but to then turn around and promote one of the most one of the more transparently races administration's in history is is kind of a sad way to market yourself or market your album and I thought Kanye would be at least a little bit aware of that or he would be above that but apparently he's not and it's made me and a bunch of other Kanye fans very
