although many Republican politicians are at least tentatively denouncing Roy Moore with a lot of ifs and possiblys and we'll sees in the wake of the allegations that he engaged in multiple relationships with underage girls including the malla station of a 14 year old as those are the allegations conservative media still largely has his back as they did yesterday for the second day running Breitbart a whole front page is this is a huge smear job by Amazon Bezos Illuminati all of that remember this is the outlet that was pushing the pizza gay conspiracy they were really worried about politicians abusing young children before now they don't seem to have as big of an issue with it when it's real yeah exactly and so we're also gonna turn to the the Conservatives on cable news as well we're gonna have some video for you but before we get to that Sean Hannity actually spoke with Roy Moore today and we don't have the the video or the full transcript yet but some of it was being live tweeted so let's talk about a few of those revelations because more said a lot of stuff he said that he admits to knowing two of the 16 to 18 year old women named in the Washington Post article saying quote he dated a lot of young ladies then which he said as a defense I don't know that that actually is much fence really tons of questionably young people yes so he doesn't remember them but I think he also I want to say in the interview because I suppose I heard some bits of it he also said that be he has their parent he talked to their mother for approval first or he and asked their parents for approval so it was okay yeah so is that knowing them in the biblical sense I hope not and and so was saying that yeah he dated young woman back then and he knew those two basically is admitting the charges that he claimed were lies and Spears that and he even did a fundraising email that we'll tell you about in a second where he called them lies apparently they weren't lies because you basically just admitted it he denies the fourteen-year-old yeah that's 16 18 year old now that's I'm coming around to that point which is important which is that the legal age of consent in Alabama is 16 so those would have been legal and gentlemanly if you ask their parents in your in your mid-thirties you like date sixteen-year-olds and I will have to find out if the great state of Alabama's okay with that I guess John pointed out Pizza Gate etc people are very concerned of politicians dating very young people but unless they are unless they're really Christian and really good Christians in which case making out with sixteen year olds when you're in your mid-30s apparently awesome but we'll find out soon enough probably in the life you're just emulating the example of Joseph now he also said asked whether he had dated girls as young as 16 he says I don't dispute that in other words yes yes yes and and and if you combine that with I dated a lot of young girls then that totally does not mean that you dated younger than 16 and it certainly doesn't mean that you tried to date younger than 16 but if you're routinely going around trying to scope out 16 17 18 year old girls it's possible you might have hit one younger than that at some point so again these are supposed to be defenses of him he also said I'm sure in the next four weeks they're gonna come out with another article get a lot of the rest of them well and and so we're like a little bit joking but like yeah when when when these things come out it makes other people feel comfortable perhaps talking and so it's not impossible that more could more also Roy Moore says that he has quote evidence of collusion but didn't say what that was or what the evidence would be I guess the idea being that these people who are making these allegations about him that he says almost all the details are true but he didn't do anything wrong the fourteen-year-old by the way as we said in the show yesterday voted for Donald Trump is voted for Republicans in the last three presidential elections has not worked with the Democratic Party or the Democratic opponent in this race is involved in collusion to try to take him down and so that's today we're gonna have some more video of the the defense of him but what do you guys think about this defense okay so first of all when he says collusion what he probably means is that it was Oppo research and then given to the Washington Post which happens all the time okay that is real it happens why wouldn't Luther strange have use that's Luther strange did try to use this he apparently didn't have the forty year old because he hadn't read an ad that was referencing how lenient Rory Moore was in a case of child rape and sodomy yeah we talked about that yes yeah so so it wasn't specifically this but you know he might have been just hitting him on the on the decision on the judicial decision where Rory Moore's like I mean was it really no harm yeah evidence of harm when one was forcibly sodomized you know I think the kid was under twelve right and so it was a preposterous insane olya maybe strange was just hitting him on that or he might have known this stuff but didn't have enough yeah and was referencing that in that ad but if the Oppo research in pointing out that it's out poor research is fair the Republicans saying hey it's interesting that it's coming out right before the election that's fair but then the more important question is did he do it in the case of the 16 and above he's now admitting basically that he did do it on the fourteen-year-old if you didn't hear the story earlier he took off all her his clothes he got her in our underwear fondled her and tried to get her to touch his crotch well that would be illegal and so now some of the defenses of other Alabama Republicans are well as John was kind of alluding to Joseph and and you know did it to Mary so why not literally literally that's the Republican politician Alabama comptroller of Alabama made that comment yet he said it doesn't sound immoral or illegal well no actually if it's true it's completely illegal I don't know the statute of limitations has run on it but it's not a good excuse for why you did it yeah I think miss absolute and I think the other argument I guess they could be saying there's collusion and you have city ban and make this argument sort of saying this Jeff Bezos Amazon owned Washington Post but I think that argument collusion doesn't make any sense if you understand at all how newsrooms work at a newspaper we're at at or editorially the editorial into business owners who are very separate from the hard-working journalists at every outlet right so you have the editorial people who make their edits or decisions of who they're going to endorse under the not gonna endorse and reporter good beat reporters who are covering a story and in this particular story there thirty sources not one not two not ten there's thirty different sources on this one and it has nothing to do with who the paper indoors has nothing to do what the editorial board did has everything to do with a good journalist getting Oppo research and then doing their own research and saying we have 30 sources so these debunk all thirty of them and then let's have a conversation and now and they cannot opening themselves up to possible legal action absolutely check and double check and triple check to make sure that this is true and that is exactly why they might not have had it in time for the primary or any other race that he ran cuz it takes a talent because you don't want to make these charges and be proven wrong that would be disaster yeah look ever only son yes so so they had to button it up with 30 sources before they went yeah to print it and that's why the guys like John McCain have said yeah good enough he should step down yeah while other Republicans in the Senate are like well you know what if they had 31 sources so I'm not yet convinced watch the young turks commercial-free downloaded or stream it watch it any way you like at TYT Network comm slash join
