Mary Jane because it's such an awesome

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,109

19
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,430
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> being Mary Jane I just had so</font>

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,070
many questions about the choices that

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,920
Mary Jane made but then the more I got

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,370
into the series<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like as crazy as I</font>

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,530
thought Mary Jane was and some of the

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,180
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I kind of judged her for for</font>

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,210
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> illogical I realized that she and</font>

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,550
I are a lot alike like I'm almost as

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,240
crazy outside except for saving a nexus

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
sperm will ever be on my to-do list but

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,619
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the other things that I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,720
leg hurts snapping back at her friends

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,060
or just her over like her kind of hottie

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tottie attitude and perception of her</font>

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,080
own life and judgmental-ness of her

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,390
equal leveling peers I hadn't realized

35
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,659
like I not that I act out in the same

36
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,430
way but it's not like some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,290
thoughts haven't crossed my mind per se

38
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,240
like there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much to relate to</font>

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">on so many levels for so many people</font>

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really I'm cycle I</font>

41
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,610
really enjoy the show even if I don't

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,470
agree with Mary Jane I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just still like</font>

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,079
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really good program by the way</font>

44
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,970
sidewise his head on my hands up we're

45
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,530
gonna ask one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> also is</font>

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,450
who I brought Mary Jane is no matter how

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,340
much the misogynist a kind of blackmail

48
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,170
trope on YouTube what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project that</font>

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,670
black women characters are kind of

50
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,540
salacious home wreckers or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mary</font>

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jane when she opened season Wyatt</font>

52
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,250
dealing with I'm Andre played by the

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,130
eternal fuck boy omari hardwick

54
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,090
I like the progression of that

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,770
relationship because I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

56
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,290
lot of women of power and i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,700
black women power but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know this</font>

58
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,790
study dignity of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> rates is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

59
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,760
will put ourselves in positions where we

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,040
know we can kind of control our own

61
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,310
vulnerability and so seeing Mary J go

62
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,320
back to Andre even I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like</font>

63
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,260
dumbest but when girl don't let that

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mary Jane I feel like Mary Jane isn't</font>

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,540
that far off from Gabrielle Union like I

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,340
can take me acting the same in real life

76
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,220
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like gotta be you too cute</font>

77
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,750
for this negro what are the only one

78
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,580
that watch these and one up and through

79
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,050
our discomfort with their own

80
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,690
vulnerability we will put ourselves in

81
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,460
precarious situations that really aren't

82
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,010
for our own benefit in the long run so

83
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,160
whether it was Mary<font color="#CCCCCC"> Janes you know</font>

84
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,620
really willing to go back to Andre or

85
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,960
just how she even dealt with his wife

86
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,020
and trying to one-up her at the brunch

87
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,090
in and stuff those were all just like

88
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,650
Mary Jane wasn't cuz wore her own

89
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,920
vulnerability and you know that's this

90
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,810
she allowed herself to be in a situation

91
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,630
that was less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> because in some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

92
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,420
she could<font color="#E5E5E5"> control certain aspects of it</font>

93
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,590
you know it's like this mind game<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

94
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,970
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself we've all done it the</font>

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything that phil was like the one</font>

97
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,070
series thus far this is just so cliche

98
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,340
she like dialed her ex<font color="#CCCCCC"> dame they have</font>

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,310

they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't never seem to get it</font>

101
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,930

178
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,419
the broadcast journalism industry and

179
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,699
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoutout to BuzzFeed and the</font>

180
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,160
change in the light market it was like

183
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,320
girl and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it speaks to kind of</font>

184
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,849
how we judge especially black women

185
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,400
especially women that we perceive as

186
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,199
poor black women<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we</font>

187
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,770
automatically dismiss their intelligence

188
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,169
and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge and that's kind of</font>

189
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:30,460
really what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on with this</font>

190
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,770
smart brown belt thing is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

191
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,300
for the college educated you know I

192
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyday black</font>

193
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,740
woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> who so often told that she's not</font>

194
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,930
smart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's not intelligent that she</font>

195
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,820
starts to believe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dismiss the</font>

196
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,590
actual intelligence that she does hold

197
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,349
and I think Cecilia character just

198
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,650
speaks are so many on so many levels to

199
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,330
that even though she's conniving swindle

200
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ain't shit she's smart and ain't</font>

201
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,409
shit though I really hope that Mary Jane

202
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:01,810
doesn't fall for this window<font color="#E5E5E5"> i loke</font>

203
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,310
think it'll be cliche just because

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,530
Loretta Devine always kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of plays the</font>

207
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,969

257
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,370

258
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,640
doesn't have 25k in cash around not that

259
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,050
even if she did I would be willing to

260
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,240
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to her but I assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone</font>

261
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,070
of Mary Jane stature would just have no

262

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more cash on hand in the bank I</font>

263
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,220
don't know Vera um but the CC asking for

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,990
90 k I don't even know why they gave her

265
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,600
a big stink like that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 k when</font>

266
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,250
it comes to settlement money and taxes

267
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,350
really ain't nothing and she asking for

268
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,700
pennies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was going to be</font>

269
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,580
cleaning the millions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz the car</font>

270
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,160
accident lawsuit like people come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

271
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,410
come our way more money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that just</font>

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,140
side chick but<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey whatever I actually</font>

274
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,200
really like cars character I really

275
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,260
enjoy her kind of struggle between being

276
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,100
a career woman

277
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,329
and being a mother and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> even kind of</font>

278
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:01,980
reshaping how we think about mothers who

279
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,449
don't necessarily have custody of their

280
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,370
children because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a better</font>

281
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,319
interest for their child<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live with</font>

282
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,550
the other parent I think there is

283
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,529
especially in the American<font color="#CCCCCC"> society this</font>

284
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,930
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the mom should be the one that</font>

285
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,750
suits full custody of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kids and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

286
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">of times that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the favor of</font>

287
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,370
the father either so I like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

288
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,069
they're tackling that subject through

289
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:25,519
the viewpoint of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cara who was a Latino</font>

290
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,949
but falls on the more European side of

291
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:32,699
things woman and hurt her own conflict

292
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,100
with her own kind of ethnic identity and

293
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,829
you know the being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to kind of a</font>

294
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:41,370
pass as you would say because cara that

295
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,370
has not dated other latino men she kind

296
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,170
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoop tries to push away a lot of her</font>

297
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,930
cultural identity and then you know her

298
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,480
struggle with allowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> her son's ago</font>

299
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,980
live with their father full time and

300
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,810
what that means for her as a mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

301
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,269
you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> being a woman who does</font>

302
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:59,339
love her kids but also really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does love</font>

303
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,889
her career hope that you know Mary Jane

304
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,779
can make more fruitful decisions in her

305
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,959
relationship life but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just I</font>

306
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,850
enjoy watching her crazy because it

307
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,589
reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of my own crazy it reminds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

308
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,329
