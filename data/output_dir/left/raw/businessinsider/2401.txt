00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,870
welcome back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us we answer at the</font>

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,369
Business Insider so let's just get

3
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,930
straight to the questions here what do

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,380
we have first Gordon asks do you believe

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,050
in future dominance of America or do you

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,480
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kaput well I'd say it about</font>

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,240
5050 no I mean really I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy the</font>

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,000
caput arguments granted we have the same

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,530
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of debt and we have political</font>

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,590
problems but generally the world seems

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more stable not less so</font>

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,530
free democratic countries have a pretty

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,379
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> track record and people have always</font>

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,539
had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to believe America was</font>

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,980
about to go down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> toilet or really</font>

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,170
any other country wise so if I were

17
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to bet I would bet on America's</font>

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,930
continued can I wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say dominance</font>

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,329
exactly because there are other

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,550
countries coming up I i think that the

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,530
emergence of other international powers

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,909
and strong economies is actually

23
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably good for us see if perhaps we</font>

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,570
won't dominate the globe like we used to

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,580
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we could put so</font>

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,970
hopefully that makes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel good next</font>

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,840
one comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> shane o who asks why is</font>

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,750
the government allowed to run and

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,180
dominate coverage for flood insurance

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,590
well there is a resistance about a

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,060
public option for health<font color="#CCCCCC"> insurance</font>

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,380
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,850
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of kinds of insurance</font>

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government does get into flood</font>

35
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,009
insurance is one hurricane insurance is

36
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,619
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> there probably wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even be</font>

37
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,810
any such thing as coastal housing if we

38
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,030
didn't have hurricane insurance because

39
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,579
no private company would ensure property

40
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,229
that just gets destroyed every five

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,770
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the reason that we accept</font>

42
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,509
this actually has something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font>

43
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,939
our attitude towards housing we have a

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,100
very pearl housing policy in the

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,140
government and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,750
people that no you can't build here or

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,640
you can't build by this river you can't

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,290
build by this coast because<font color="#CCCCCC"> your house</font>

49
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,729
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get destroyed every few</font>

50
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:06,690
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no one</font>

51
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,610
back it up so instead we keep

52
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,650
subsidizing it I think it's a bad idea I

53
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,110
do think it should be privatized flood

54
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,880
insurance that way we would have less

55
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,660
disasters every time I could have less

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,070
there would be less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a human toll</font>

57
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,350
every time a natural disaster struck but

58
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,120
as it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we keep subsidizing people</font>

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,520
building in dangerous places seems like

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,400
a bad idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me next question comes</font>

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,380
from the pseudonymous professor

62
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">funkenstein who asks are you a dog</font>

63
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,960
person which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be an inside</font>

64
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,380
joke and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> only answer is that I hate</font>

65
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,640
Tennessee so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the question</font>

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,000
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the response</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,410
let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you ever</font>

68
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">consider that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an oversupply</font>

69
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,780
crisis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not enough</font>

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,210
demand for most of our assets oil gas

71
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,570
clothes exotic resorts etc and what will

72
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,100
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new normal in terms of</font>

73
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,380
unemployment no I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

74
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's the case I believe human</font>

75
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,710
demand is basically insatiable if people

76
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,290
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go to Resorts people are</font>

77
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,459
always going to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use energy</font>

78
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,959
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are always going to want new</font>

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
clothes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I don't really think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the correct formulation of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crisis of</font>

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the current the current</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation to me</font>

82
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,310
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a coordinate coordination</font>

83
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,380
issue why can't we get everyone working

84
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,590
what sort of in some sort of harmonic

85
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,030
manner so that everyone is doing

86
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,739
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> productive why is it that</font>

87
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,570
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are skilled who are</font>

88
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,580
unemployed I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is</font>

89
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,010
over supply<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goods or an oversupply of</font>

90
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">labor I do to some extent believe that</font>

91
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,870
supply creates its own demand there's a

92
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,760
lot of economist things I think the

93
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is through a bubble through the</font>

94
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,750
bubble that we've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had we've had a</font>

95
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,420
big misallocation of capital and talent

96
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,010
and that now we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

97
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,050
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the assets we have I</font>

98
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,600
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helps but I on to get to your</font>

99
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,310
question I also think that explains why

100
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,200
unemployment will remain high for some

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,760
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah does the bludge to give out a</font>

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,590
lot of good<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock tips around the office</font>

103
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,810
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> she's pretty much out of that</font>

104
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,519
game frankly what is your view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

105
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,548
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boeing opting to build the 787 in</font>

106
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,810
South<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carolina</font>

107
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,149
this was just announced yesterday bowing

108
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,650
his head all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems building</font>

109
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,010
at 787 and now they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build it</font>

110
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,900
in South Carolina<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason is</font>

111
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,880
controversial is because South Carolina

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a right to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work state and in the</font>

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">northern union states</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where they used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

114
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">build stuff there were too many strikes</font>

115
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,370
and labor was too high so that's

116
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,080
friendly pretty understandable that they

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,210
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to keep building</font>

118
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,220
inexpensive Union State I mean they've

119
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,050
already had enough problems with their

120
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,290
production facilities you know plant

121
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,690
shutdowns certainly don't help then

122
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,820
being said there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another reason to</font>

123
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,560
wonder what the idea is in South

124
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,990
Carolina<font color="#E5E5E5"> because besides the labor</font>

125
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,110
supply<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptions to Boeing's</font>

126
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,240
manufacturing facilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also just</font>

127
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,850
not that well coordinated in terms of

128
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,350
supply<font color="#CCCCCC"> chain they've had problems with</font>

129
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,790
surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> part shortages that have come</font>

130
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,990
up things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and so by further by</font>

131
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,790
further spreading around the geography

132
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,979
of their supply chain I suspect they'll

133
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,410
have more problems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that labor may</font>

134
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,940
diminish is a problem but that other

135
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,570
other logistics issues will emerge next

136
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,050
question comes from Jeff Bardo who asks

137
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,789
what the real reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for the public</font>

138
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">option do we really believe that it's</font>

139
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,910
competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the Democrats are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font>

140
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,010
or is there something more nefarious I

141
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,680
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I do think they're they're</font>

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
being the the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are pushing the</font>

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,460
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> option are being a little bit</font>

144
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,750
disingenuous when they talk about

145
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">competition I do think that politicians</font>

146
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,960
speak to some extent there I there would

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,660
be ways to create competition without a

148
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,970
public option I do really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think though</font>

149
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,310
that for the most part the people push

150
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,710
pushing the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> option do believe</font>

151
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,380
that insurance the greed of insurance

152
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,510
companies is what's causing our health

153
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">care problems in this country I don't</font>

154
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's the issue I think as</font>

155
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,750
evidence is the fact that health
