other Democrats expressed frustration that the FBI had not spoken to Ford nor a host of other potential witnesses in connection with the probe the most notable part of this report is what's not in it it looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited perhaps by the White House we had many fears that this was a very limited process having received the thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized I'm not allowed to discuss it the public can't see it it's a complete sham the investigation was a sham they didn't interview all the potential eyewitness they didn't interview all the cooperating witnesses I'm actually shocked I'm actually shocked okay President Trump was briefed this afternoon or this morning actually on the contents of the report which will not be made publicly he's not officially in a series of tweets Trump lamented what he called the harsh and unfair treatment of Cavanaugh and the quote totally uncorroborated allegations well obviously I didn't get a chance to find them in the second tweet Trump wrote this is now the seventh time the FBI has investigated judged Cavanaugh if we made it a hundred it would still not be good enough for the obstructionist Democrats that's Trump meanwhile Mitch McConnell indicated his plans to move full speed ahead joining the president defending Cavanaugh for goodness sake this is the United States of America nobody is supposed to be guilty until proven innocent in this country I'll be proud to vote to advance this nomination tomorrow well the first procedural vote which will test the power of those for Cavanaugh will come tomorrow morning there's still four key senators who remain publicly uncommitted these are the ones we're watching Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska she's a strong person Maine Susan Collins Arizona Jeff Flake and one Democrat West Virginia's Joe Manchin I'm Jeremy now Mike Casey Heinen NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Barbara McQuade former US attorney Phil Rucker White House bureau chief for The Washington Post Casey I have a lot of hopes that maybe mer Murkowski will show some leadership she seems more like a leader than the how do you figure the order of succession in the decision-making of those left four to decide Chris I think that your sense on Lisa Murkowski is correct and she actually spent the afternoon here at the Capitol meeting with survivors of sexual assault and abuse many of whom came out of her office and tears after having talked about their own experiences she has very carefully avoided our cameras so we haven't spoken to her today but everyone that I've talked to all of my sources and and Senators in leadership who have spoken to off-the-record suggest or excuse me on background I should say not off the record have suggested that she may be more willing to potentially play a vote no vote now Susan Collins on the other hand they tend to say the opposite that she has been throughout this process looking for a way to vote yes but we also don't know yet what her decision is going to be she said she is going to have an announcement tomorrow she spent a good chunk of the evening she was one of the last people to leave the secure area where the FBI report was so I might put her on the other end of the spectrum and then Jeff Flake and Joe Manchin are real wildcards here and I think that the dynamic that that I've heard from my sources is that nobody wants to be the 50th vote nobody wants to be the person that makes or breaks this nomination joe Manchin I think would would prefer to be able to vote YES on Kavanagh from a political perspective for him it's really a no-brainer and the way that this has kind of come to the forefront over the last week has made it much harder for him in a race where he had previously felt pretty secure but the reality is if it's a Democrat that puts Kavanagh on the court I mean that is going to be an impossible position to be in too so it's really kind of this bizarre game of chicken where they're all watching each other to see what they're gonna do and I think that the dynamic is is really very unpredictable at this point and I also think that you know you could potentially see some cracks or fissures in the event that it does seem like this is going down I mean this is a difficult vote for some other members of the Republican Conference that we're not even talking about like perhaps senator Cory Gardner of Colorado I want to suggest that he's in play but you know this is this is a tough vote for somebody in a swing state like that let's talk about how the nomination could still be defeated you've got to hide camp who's had the guts to be a Profile in Courage now you've got it seems to be Markowski if she moves against this nomination will flake go with it um you know I I'm not I'm just not sure Chris I don't know if you can I'm not sure if you can go that far no one has been able to kind of get inside Jeff Lakes head because quite frankly there was a time when he was a yes he put out a statement saying I'm gonna back Kavanaugh after hearing all of this then he wavered went into this FBI investigation so the the person I spoke to most recently with with the most position to know says you know nobody's inside his head no one has any idea what he's merely personally conflicted one person could be in his head that is a Mitch McConnell when he agreed to go along well he had to go along with this week long short short well short hand investigation did he get a commitment from flake that if he does this he'll boat yes if he didn't find anything big my reporting doesn't necessarily bear that out Chris although clearly McConnell felt as though this was a way that he could potentially get the votes that he needed from this group of people so there certainly was that level of understanding but I don't think that there was any you know straight-out commitment that if this is fine you know we'll vote yes because we'll report what are you here what are we hearing right now is that the protesters right now yes so that's their actually right over my shoulder here you can't I think you can only really see the trees they're kind of an a tent they're gonna be here totally overnight we could hear a little earlier Bernie Sanders very distinct voice I spent a lot of time on the trail with Bernie Sanders this was giving me some flashbacks but we're told that they're gonna camp out on the east front of the Capitol all night long and into tomorrow morning when we know that Mitch McConnell actually just went to the floor and announced that the vote will be tomorrow morning good for them thank you very much Senate Republicans have seen the FBI report argued it vindicated Cavanaugh and the allegations against him and press to move forward on a vote the senators who requested the supplemental FBI background check got what they requested and I am ready to the because you've humiliated this guy enough and they seems to be no bottom for somebody so why don't we dunk in the water and safety plays this is a Search and Destroy mission this is not a search for the truth and this man is qualified and they put him through this type of a mess just because they are unhappy that Donald Trump had the right to appoint them it's just plain wrong Robert this is a job application that we've been told that's for all the Republicans for all those weeks of the actual earlier confirmation hearings it was a job application not a criminal investigation yet if it's a job application and you've got testimony that the guy is a belligerent drunk at times when he drinks too much he gets very belligerent dangerous even to people why didn't they go down that line up of an inquiry it seems to me that's one of these you'd have to look at yeah I agree with you Chris I think that they want to have it both ways I think that they're either deliberately or inadvertently confusing the American public where the standard in a criminal case is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence and all of those things and that does matter when you're talking about taking away someone's liberty in this instance it's a very different matter it isn't taking away bread Cavanaugh's Liberty it's should we be giving him the privilege and responsibility of sitting on the highest court in the land which oversees the criminal justice system and if you have someone with a credible allegation of sexual assault in their past and other allegations as well like the one we're getting from Debra Ramirez why on earth would we want to taint the Supreme Court with someone like that when there is a long line of other conservative judges who could equally be nominated to this court you don't have that tank kneel court or such for example made it through without these kinds of allegations but the allegation is also include I know it's wet Nick you can argue whether she's a great witness or not but she is talking about that should have investigated this idea of getting women's drunk young girls actually teenagers drunk so they could have sex with them with multiple partners against their thoughtful process at least deliberative process and that's what Cosby has been sent away for rightfully in prison right now if this is sit this is true it's incredibly serious and looks like they didn't want to talk to her they even talked this wedding Barbara yeah yes and you know again it seems that the FBI was given a short leash do this in less than a week and had some limitations on who they should be talking to there have been many people who could corroborate the story of Deborah Ramirez certainly listening to what Julie sweat Nick had to say if this is a quest for the truth you would want them to ask questions of all those people and provide all of that information and I think they are gambling on the fact that they're going to get a vote and they're going to get a confirmation but that fails to account for this is only going to be thorough if the Senate says it is because they have to be satisfied that they've had a thorough investigation and don't think this is the end of it those people are going to continue to come forward I think we're going to see journalists telling their stories in the weeks and months to come and do we want justice cat a justice Kavanaugh and a supreme court to be forever tainted with these stories that didn't come out until later hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to
