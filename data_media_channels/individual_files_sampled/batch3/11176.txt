president Trump's pulled out a visiting Briton next month now he says it's because he's unhappy with the expensive brand new US Embassy in London reason I canceled my trip to London is them not a big fan of the Obama administration's having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts only to build a new one in enough location for 1.2 billion dollars bad deal one side meatsac of ribbon no strewth where is this thing polly pocus with this in London where is it it's it's in Vauxhall isn't it if fact that sit behind you looks a lovely place not too far out the centre what's Donald Trump's problem I hear a wonder like this is what all the hoo-ha is about it's the new US Embassy in the area of Nine Elms which is being regenerated into sort of an embassy quarter it's set to open to the public next week Donald Trump was supposed to arrive in February or was widely expected that he'd be cutting the ribbon then that's not happening anymore clearly the old building of the u.s. embassy one that was on this sort of grand old square in the very heart of the city in the center of Mayfair which many people know is the most expensive location on the Monopoly board but the interesting thing about the president's tweets is that there was a slight error he accused the Obama administration of selling that old building for peanuts it was in fact the Bush administration before him and there have been suggestions that this whole embassy Rao is a way of diverting attention away from the fact that perhaps President Trump didn't feel like he was going to be particularly welcome here in the UK almost two million people here signed a petition against him coming here claiming perhaps the most British reason of all that it would embarrass the Queen Donald Trump arriving here and the Mayor of London hasn't been too welcoming either take a listen to what Sadiq Khan has had to say about Donald Trump I don't think we should roll out the red carpet to the presidents of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for after this latest incident it's increasingly clear that any official visit at all from President Trump to Britain would not be welcomed and as special relationships go this one looking special for all the wrong reasons right now we know diplomacy hasn't been Donald Trump's strong suit but perhaps a year into the job he is managing to surpass even himself because he has reportedly insulted high tea and a host of other nations as well on top of this Rao with the UK according to media reports he referred to high tea and a number of other countries as quote undesirable second-rate countries and not in those words the White House hasn't even denied that he said it instead they've issued quite a perplexing statement saying that certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries but President Trump will always fight for the American people so a diplomatic route with Haiti now rumors that they could be what the island nation could be recalling its ambassador to Washington and probably a few bridges to build and fences to mend for US diplomats all in a day's work or should I say in a few tweets for the US president ending the working week on a bang so to speak and of course the brexit coming up as far as Britain's concerns gonna want to make all the contacts again with America it's come interested to see how they get around that one for now Polly Boyd - in London thanks
