TRUMP AND OTHERS ARE COMING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS. THAT WILL BE GREATLY CHEER WOULD. BHAR MAR IS GENERAL JACK KEAN AUTHORITY E, GENERAL, IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MARTHA. Martha: SO MANY STEPS FORWARD AND THIS IS A DISTURBING DEVELOPMENT WHAT WE ARE WATCHING HERE. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. SYRIA REPRESENTS THE ANCHOR IN THE REGION AND THEY WANT TO GAIN MORE DOMINANCE OF THE COUNT ROPES IN THE AREA AND CASE POINT IS ISRAEL. FOR MONTHS NOW. IRANIANS ARE CONDUCTING A MILITARY BUILD UP IN SOUTHERN AND SOUTHWESTERN SYRIA WITH THE PURPOSE OF ENCROACHING ON ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY, AND SECURITY. THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY DID IN LEBANON. WHERE HESBOLLAH HAS 30000 ROCKET AND MISSILES CAPABLE OF REACHING TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM. AND THEY WANT TO DO IT IN SYRIA AND SO THAT IT WOULD OVERWHELM ISRAEL'S MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM AND THE TARGETS WOULD BE TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF WHAT IRAN IS UP TO. THEY WANT TO UNDERMINE THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL AND CREATE INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRY AND IN TIME DESTROY IT. THAT'S SOMETHING THEY SAY EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THE ISRAELIS DIDN'T COME BACK WITH A PORPORTIONATE STRIKE. THEY CAME BACK WITH AN OVERWHELMING RESPONSE AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE INTRODUCTION. Martha: IS THAT WISE ON THEIR PART? THERE IS NO WAY ISRAEL WILL TOLERATE THE BUILD UP. AND THAT LEADS TO A QUESTION OF DOES THIS LEAD TO ALL OUT WAR BETWEEN IRAN AND ISRAEL. I DON'T THINK SO. THEY WERE JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. ROUHANI ORDERED THE STRIKE. AND ISRAEL TOOK OUT JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEIR MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS IT A HECK OF A PRICE THE IRANIANS WILL PAY. THE DEPTH PATTERN IS NEVER GET THEIR OWN FORCES INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT EXCEPT FOR THE EIGHT YEARS THEY FOUGHT WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN. THAT WILL SEND A LOUD MISSAGE TO THE IRANIANS. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HESBOLLAH WILL NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ISRAEL WILL NOT RESPOND TO HESBOLLAH, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL LEAD TO ALL OUT WAR. THAT IS NOT IN IRAN'S INTEREST. Martha: THEY ARE PUSHING AND HOW THEY RESPOND WILL BE CRUCIAL. WE WATCHED ONE OF THE SOUND BITS, FROM MIKE POMPEO, THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE. WHAT DOES IT TELL US WHAT WE WATCHED THIS WEEK, GENERAL. THE RETURNING OF HOSTAGES AND THE TWO POSITIVE MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SECRETARY OF STATE. I THINK HE'S THE STAR OF THE ADMINISTRATION SENSE HE WAS IN THE CIA AND SUPER STAR AS A RESULT OF THE POSITION HE'S IN. AND IT IS POMPEO'S VISIT THAT GAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP HIS OPTIMISM AND WHY HIS LANGUAGE AND RHETORIC INCREASED AS A RESULT OF POMPEO'S INTERACTION WITH KIM JONG-UN. I RETURNED FROM JAPAN AND LOADERS IN THE GOVERNMENT ARE ECHOING THIS. THEY SEE A POTENTIAL FOR A BREAK THROUGH HERE. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT KIM JONG-UN IS GOING TO HAND US OVER ALL OF HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEY WILL PROBABLY NOT GIVE ALL OF THOSE WEAPONS TO US. BUT THERE IS IT POTENTIAL TO GENUINELY MAKE PROGRESS. AND I THINK THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TOUGH MINDS ABOUT HOLDING TO THEIR STANDARD WHICH IS COMPLETE DPE NUCLEARATION. Martha: IT APPEARS OF A CHANGE OF TUNE FROM KIM JONG-UN. THE PRESIDENT THINKS THAT AND DO YOU? I DO. HE'S MOVING TO A DIFFERENT PLACE CERTAINLY. AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE SANCTIONS CAUSED A PROBLEM TO HIM AND THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE AND THERE IS A MILITARY OPTION ON THE TABLE AND HE HAS POTENTIAL TO INCREASE PROSPER ETFOR HIS COUNTRY AND HIMSELF AND THEY ARE
