I’m Stefano Sollima, and I’m
the director of “Sicario: Day
of the Soldado."
This scene is the
main moment in which
we see something
changing in Alejandro,
played by Benicio Del Toro.
It’s a sort of reminder
of his past, of his loss,
of his family that was
killed, of his own daughter.
And then, of course,
having Isabel next to him
during this reminiscence
plays a key role
in their relationship.
And this is sort of
a switch of emotion.
Because until now,
Isabel has only
being a sort of pawn
in Alejandro’s hand
to win this dirty war,
to get his vengeance.
I feel interested in this scene,
because it’s the
first scene ever
where we introduce a skill
of Alejandro that has nothing
to do with his vengeance.
I felt it was important
to bring down the volume
after one of the
biggest action
set pieces in the movie.
I felt that there was a big
need of a quieter moment.
Because by listening to the
silence in this sequence,
and feeling the humanity
and the normal life
of this deaf, mute
man, we are able to put
the loudness and the
violence of the action a bit
in perspective.
In the original
script, it was spoken.
And it was Benicio’s
idea to change it
into sign language exchange.
I think it’s really smart.
Because in this way, we
create an immediate bond
between the two guys.
