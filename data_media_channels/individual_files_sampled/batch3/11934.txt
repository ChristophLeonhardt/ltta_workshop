hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser 'part who remembers I Dream of Jeannie remember that live I just came to me I don't know why those shows are fantastic bewitched I can't make my nose do it that woman did on that show but it was pretty cool especially as a youngster anyway we have to get into the news darn it Stacy I thought you were saying that because you know what when I grew up a lot of people always said I always be wish'd you can do that with their knows little miracles happen speaking of a crazy sort of miracles happening this is a headline out of like a dystopian future but today and I have two headlines that we're going to talk about and we're going to compare the two headlines the first one is prisoners could serve 1,000 year sentences in eight and a half hours in the future future biotechnology could be used to trick a prisoner's mind into thinking they have served a 1000 year sentence a group of scientists have claimed philosopher Rebecca Roach is in charge of a team of scholars focused upon the ways futuristic technologies might transform punishment dr. Roach claims the prison sentences of serious criminals could be made worse by extending their lives at least they feel like they're extending their lives well this plays into my theme of a return to medievalism and a return to a pre enlightenment form of society of kings and serfs and you know remember during those times the the church was very free in suggesting that they could condemn you to hell for eternity in exchange to get out of that you give them an indulgence you know then you had the Reformation of course Martin Luther but for a while there they were you could buy your way out of hell so as the economy becomes bifurcated and you have the super rich the Jeff Bezos with over a hundred billion dollars then you have hundreds of millions of dollars 100 million people eating dirt effectively like those stuck on a Haitian dirt farm you're going to have a return of this indulgent system where people will pay the technology lure the technology Pope a huge box to keep them out of hell that hell will be technologically created in your mind by serving a 1,000 year prison term so you have a Bill Gates the world or Jeff Bezos or the Google twins or the Winklevoss guys they'll essentially be sitting there at the gates of Hell like sub ERISA three-headed dog of war and they'll say give us a billion dollars of crypto coins or we're gonna send you to a thousand years of hell and so it's back to medieval times unfortunately the Enlightenment is now over well it is indeed like medieval times this is already kind of classified as torture today right now what by the UN sort of bodies well the u.s. obviously they've mentioned in particular has put a lot of people in isolation so people will spend like 10 20 years some of the Black Panthers who were arrested 40 years ago have served they've been in solitary confinement this whole time so that that's considered a form of torture so here they're gonna presumably they'll be all alone in this thousand years condensed into eight and a half years but presumably if they can make people feel like they're living a thousand years they're gonna be all alone in whatever world they're in Hollywood on this you know I saw during the recent award ceremony that they were wearing black and solidarity of all that sexual abuse and rape going on in Hollywood for favoritism and yet how does that apply to the US prison population here in terms of what this futuristic possibility is she says there are a number of psychoactive drugs that distort people's sense of time so you could imagine developing a pill or a liquid that made someone feel like they were serving a thousand year sentence a second scenario would be to upload human minds to computers to speed up the rate at which the mind works if the speed up were a factor of a million a millennium of thinking would be accomplished in eight and a half hours uploading the mind of a convicted criminal and running it a million times faster than normal would enable the uploaded criminal to serve a thousand year sentence in just eight and a half hours this would obviously be much cheaper for the taxpayer then extending criminals lifespans to enable them to serve a thousand years in real time so it's all about the money but again it sounds like torture because of course unless you endure it yourself and you're sitting there witnessing a person in some sort of goggles you know those like that scene of Mark Zuckerberg walking through the audience where everybody's on in a matrix and a virtual reality headset and he's the only one that can see but if you don't know you know it just feels like eight and a half hours to you as the prison guard you know you and but the the person sitting there is enduring a thousand years and that eight and a half hours you don't understand what sort of torture you're inflicting on the person yes like rush limbaugh saying people who got water bordered you know we're just faking their pain that it was just like being hazing getting a hazing at a college fraternity and then people have actually experienced waterboarding say no it's frickin torture you know you're drowning to death and it's heart elations you know here they're saying oh it's nothing it's just eight minutes of being your brain hijack eight hours and you're experiencing a thousand years of torture that's better it's for the taxpayer ultimately this is Satanism must be honest Satanism is back and he's bigger than ever he's co-opted the Silicon Valley and we're all gonna be at risk of being condemned to Hell by these you know fear mongering nincompoops anyway I think it is a former torturer it's kind of like a this Silicon Valley surveillance state sort of like where it could go wrong they're presenting it as saving you money we're gonna save you twenty five bucks in your taxes and most people those you know the Stanford Prison Experiment show that not only will the prison guard press the button not only will they press that button to send you to a thousand years of hell but taxpayers of course you're gonna say yeah okay I want a twenty five dollar tax cut yeah so you're gonna torch are a few people who cares as long as it's easy but you know I want to link this other headline to that first headline so here remember the first headline read prisoners could serve 1,000 year sentences in eight and a half years in the future the second headline also from the UK UK consumers trapped in credit card debt for longer than thought Bank of England and financial watchdog found that eighty-nine of credit card debt was held by consumers also in debt two years ago this could be an experiment already ongoing perhaps we all did actually pay off these debts and they keep on making up they keep on saying no no no it just feels like you paid off that debt it just feels like you paid off all those debts from 2008 for example during the financial crisis but we're still paying it off like maybe maybe this is the same sort of thing the fact that the UK authorities the Bank of England study found that they were surprised that the debt was still going on that they thought that the debt had been paid off but people are trapped in debt essentially there it's just they keep on rolling over their debt over and over and over and it's still the same day yeah it's all connected of course is connected it's one big backroom deal done between the central bank the kleptocrats the credit card purveyors the pumps you know the pubs are out there and price of alcohol keeps going down doesn't it not a net adjusted gross basis because they want to get as many people into debt as possible so they give them a pint of really bad booze and they get hallucinogenic fantasies of going on trips to Bermuda and other exotic locations but they're really in Surrey so 9 out of every 10 pounds of out Sun and credit card debt in November 2016 was owed by people who were also in the red two years earlier according to the study the analysis follows the rapid growth and personal borrowing and credit cards loans and car finance now rising at almost five times the rate of growth in UK pay households are finding themselves increasingly squeezed by meager earnings growth and rising inflation as the weak pound after the break set vote pushes up the cost of imported goods I'm saying that this is all psychological as well that they're never going to be able to pay off their debts the their debt and costs their costs of health care their cost of education the cost of rent the cost of servicing the debt on their credit cards is rising at five times the pace of their their income which is just a similar form of torture like that first story is that you'll like you'll the entice you in with heaven the heaven is that if you if you have this big fancy house if you take out this mortgage if you pay you know travel to the South of France on this credit card in it's like paradise literally it's paradise but the hell is that you'll be forever paying off this debt combined with the first story where we'll make you feel like you've had a thousand years is like these debts go on for forever and they never get paid off in a zero percent interest rate world you know Ben Franklin said a penny saved is a penny earned he preached frugality and that's the cornerstone of the American Way debt is the currency of beggars and thieves gold is the currency of kings silver the currency of princes you fiat money is the currency of who knows where does debt those are the the poorest and the stupidest as soon as you said the currency of princes of course I thought of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who I believe is still hanging upside down and they're rich and Riyadh so I don't know we're like that's that's a weird thing because you know we're because we're in DC where it means we're in a hotel room which means we're watching in the news and it's so weird to think that this guy who is such a celebrity on the likes of CNBC and as always on the news here used to be on the news here and it was such a huge portion of Twitter and Fox like the veteran nobody mentions this guy's being tortured and is refusing to give up a six billion dollars and instead it's like you know as Orwellian as that first headline is like they're talking about this reformist Prince Mohammed bin Salman and you're like did it did I just like wake up and this that am I in that thousand year experiments like am I in like some weird alternate reality what what the heck is going on like why did why why are they not talking about their guy he was the there were the ones they like this is our good buddy Prince Alwaleed bin Talal like why are they don't care that he's like hanging upside down on the wrist yeah he's a big owner of Euro Disney as well you know it could be a new rider here at this thing you know ride the upside-down Prince yeah why doesn't he issue a crypto coin the ollie why crypto coin you can't now why not he just can't just talk to somebody in the crypto space to say put my name in a coin raised six billion dollars overnight I'd hate to see the reviews for TripAdvisor at their ritz riyadh because if you see the photos all day they arrested some more princes again because they complained about the money being stolen so they arrested them and put them on those days a referral anyway so finally a bank data shows personal debts have risen to the highest level since before the credit crunch reaching more than two hundred billion pounds with credit cards accounting for more than seventy billion pounds of the total debt is increasing it's gonna go on for a thousand years and cool shows from the 60s do you like for like you got the I Dream of Jeannie you got bewitched I wasn't alive in the sick of me says war and so is this you missed all those good what modern farmer that came out of 6 a.m. right before the cartoons never used to watch that fantasy how the cows being milked and all this stuff is fair all the machinery but anyway we got to take a break we'll be we'll be back after this don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm max Kaiser time now to turn to max Blumenthal he's the senior editor of alternate gray zone project that's a gray zone project so you can follow that on Twitter he's a co-host of moderate rebels of Ben Norton I listen to that show it's a good show max welcome back good to be back all right let's jump right into it so you've got a recent article on truth biggest headline is how Russia Gate helps secure a dangerous arms deal tell us about it I think it is in November when Donald Trump after meeting with Vladimir Putin something that all sorts of presidents have done before him warned that the Russia gate narrative could cause people to die and he was mocked by mainstream media this guy's crazy you know maybe Donald Trump it was just this kind of primal reaction who knows what he was really talking about but now I think it's pretty clear that he may get to prove his critics right in a way they never imagined and he never imagined because under the enormous pressure of Russia Gate where he's accused of colluding with Russia the Trump administration has authorized an arms deal that the Obama administration fervently opposed the Trump fervently opposed that Trump's campaign had removed from the Republican National Committee platform and that's to send advanced anti-tank missiles to the Ukrainian military possibly to the Ukrainian National Guard which has incorporated a neo-nazi group called the Azov battalion and this will clearly escalate the conflict and the dawn bus which is right now kind of a slow-motion war of attrition people are suffering enormous Lee on the ratio of civilian to military casualties is 25 to 1 and so we're gonna see people die because of the pressure that Trump was under in his administration even from within his own administration from within the State Department to authorize this deal now let me just talk about one official in the Trump administration who you know Trump did probably didn't even know he existed he was put in by Rex Tillerson his name is Kurt Volker he's the US envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker is also the executive director of the McCain Institute he's basically John McCain's man in the Trump administration he's been clamoring for the arms deal the McCain Institute has on its board a lobbyist for the BMG group which lobbies for Raytheon Raytheon is the maker of these advanced anti-tank missiles that are being sent to Ukraine so Trump's US envoy to Ukraine has going to make a windfall profit through the McCain Institute because of this arms deal and that's really how the sausage is made in Washington you're suggesting that Trump in order to prove that he's not in bed exactly s regime this group this this government is going to allow for this Ukrainian arms deal and the Ukraine situation of course is the flashpoint in this becoming an ever hotter cold war slash warm war with Russia yeah and it's amazing because in the West the narrative is that Russia is the aggressor however if you look at what's happened in the last 20 years it's the Reagan era deals that were made for the West not ours for NATO not to go east those are the treaties those are the things have been broken so it's really the NATO's the aggressor in all this absolutely and of course Ukraine is it's kind of like that's gonna be eventually Russia's gonna stop playing around here if you know what I mean eventually you know Russia has made it very clear that who her sovereign state we're here we're not gonna be pushed around at what point does Russia say okay you just committed an act of war they have and so I mean you brought up some interesting history I mean last month to George Washington University National Security Archive released documents showing that the that Russia was lied to in 1990 Gorbachev was lied to sorry the Soviet Union was lied to Gorbachev had asked for a pledge from George HW Bush and Secretary of State Jim Baker not to expand NATO beyond Germany and they gave their wish ten years later NATO was moving towards the Balkans their US troops in the Balkans flash-forward to 25 14 ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych of democratically elected very corrupt democratically elected refuses an association agreement with the EU which would have forced his economy to adopt austerity measures prefers a deal with Russia historic trading partner which would have given massive gas subsidies much more favorable economic deal protests start the protests are stimulated by us pro-regime change groups involve neo-nazis Yanukovych is run out of the country and the russian-speaking population in Crimea becomes deeply disturbed by these events they see that their language will be removed as an official language that they themselves could be under attack by a government influenced by neo-nazis in Kiev pro-russian demonstrators are massacred in Odessa burned alive in a building by Pro Kiev soccer hooligans and so there's a referendum in Crimea passes by over 90% to be annexed by Russia Russia annexes Crimea the US media and US national security state goes insane and you have the conflict in Donbass erupt that conflict has been extremely was extremely bloody in 2015 it's died down a little bit and I interviewed someone on the frontlines of that conflict on the Ukrainian side Brian Milic offski who volunteers with the humanitarian group and he told me that if these missiles go through and if this deal goes through it won't change the balance of power one bit because Russia can pour in more and more tanks it's right there on the border it will not allow it will not lose Don best but for civilians it will become just a massacre and so this is what the neo cons want they want to escalate a war so they can point the finger at Russia drive a defense build-up and you know deepen the conflict and liberals seem to be going along with it yeah I'm just watching the head of RT was 60 minutes by Lesley Stahl yeah and the question was one of this relationship start going sour and you know she pointed out basically in the 90s Russia the new Russia the Soviet was doing everything to kowtow to Americans basically but it was the Yugoslavia bombing that soured that relationship immediately and this encroachment east going east and this violation of all NATO agreements so it started off the cycle of this whole thing and there doesn't seem to be any end to it I don't understand what the America's endgame is I don't understand other than the corporate agenda in other words the bomb makers make a lot of money to bombs Monsanto wants to get into Ukraine in a big way as a matter of fact Victoria Nuland husband is a lobbyist for Monsanto she's the one who orchestrated the coup in Ukraine we have the tape recording of her saying you know basically orchestrating a coup so Monsanto wants to get in there Russia has said that we're who want to be an organic farm environment we hate genetically modified seeds so other than the corporate agenda so America is we're ready to start a war with Russia or they're in a war essentially with Russia purely for corporate profits even the stock works already at all-time high so they want the word is a profit motive end for this what are they're willing to throw their kids into this mix for to make their 401ks another 10% on their 401ks they're willing to kill their children essentially is what Americans are telling each other there's absolutely a profit motive absolutely and you can see the neoconservatives freaking out about Germany's pipeline deal with Russia but that really is also profit dream where does Jeremy you know they're kind of like a swing vote in all this yeah it seemingly because of course you got American troops in Germany you know the third of their energy comes from Russia they're kind of caught up in this are they swing vote you know so to speak in this is that if you see that happening and if so what's going on there yeah Germany is becoming more independent and internally it's a little less stable than it was a few years ago and Merkel was being hailed as the leader of the free world but it's adopting a more independent foreign policy it's advancing its own national interests as the Trump administration kind of discredits the US on the world stage and that's you know disturbing a lot of people in Washington whose only goal is Empire or you know as Rudyard Kipling said dominance over every palm and every pine that's what the US wants and it wants a return to the days of Yeltsin when it dominated Russia but it can't get that so you know what happened in Yugoslavia which you mentioned that was about expanding NATO NATO into a formally independent state what's happening in Ukraine was about expanding NATO and also you know advancing IMF interests in Ukraine which have been disastrous I mean you're seeing billions and billions of IMF loans going offshore in one of the most corrupt countries on earth it's not working out when it has done is fomented an enormous conflict they're putting advanced weapons systems on Russia's borders and you can imagine how Americans would react if a foreign power was putting advanced missile systems on the borders of u.s. Mexico we wouldn't be building a wall we'd be doing a whole lot more let me ask you this question about you Russian influence in US elections this this meme that we here on MSNBC all the time so as I understand it the Russian media is like any other international media they put out media all over the world globally and some of it finds its way in the US what what it seems like the criticism I'm hearing from CBS or from MSNBC is that unlike any other country's media that comes into the country it's uniquely mesmerizing yeah that it's a message that comes over it's in English and people read it or look at it and it coops their brain it jellified their brain it prevents them from having any intelligent thought and isn't it in remarkably insulting to Americans to suggest that they're so freakin stupid they're such morons that if an english-speaking message comes from another government that they are defenseless against it they can't reason through it they can't understand if it has any bias may be perceived if it has at all there isn't an incredible age insulting no agency whatsoever when lesley stahl talked about this on CNBC CBS he's like saying Americans are stupid freakin morons I mean isn't that highly insulting I mean I felt like throwing up in her face it's just vomiting on her because he's like that's the most anti-american thing I've ever heard stupid bubble gum chewing jean wearing American ski obey your master Vladimir Putin now and spread social division as if it doesn't actually already exists because of organic domestic factors there you go fix that was a joke by the way being that they're suggesting that we don't have the ability to understand these things just to clear up I'm not a Russian bot but I do hold unpopular opinions today have you ever met anyone whose decision on the 2016 presidential election was shaped by RT I mean I can't find them it's like playing it's harder than Where's Waldo because I would frequently find Waldo I cannot find a single and that was the basis of 60 minutes repository goest and a polemicist I would love to think that was true but it's not yeah flying you know anyway I stay on this show as far as how they vote in 2016 I'll tell you what though I just came from Brian Becker and John kiriakos excellent loud and clear show and Sputnik radio which is broadcasting in Washington more people should listen to it I mean it's one of the best foreign policy and current affairs shows by a former CIA whistleblower and a veteran anti-war activist who's you know traveled the world is really incisive and one of the things that motivates me to go on these shows is the disinformation coming out of the national security state and the attack that Sputnik and RT are under I feel like okay well if you know you want to attack them that's publicity they're in the spotlight and that's that's better than no publicity and being totally ignored and they must be doing something right and the fact is they are there these are some of the only outlets left in the United States that are challenging the bipartisan permanent war State and so I'm happy to go on shows like this I'm excited to go into Sputnik whenever I'm invited and I'm proud to defend these networks in public I don't approve of everything they do but really it's one of the only outlets we have left to present a dissident opinion I went to university and you know a New York University and in the 70s and the 80s and we would have intelligent discourse and discuss issues yeah you know then you go and you have a couple of beers and you know go on with your life you know what oh man we got to cut it off or at a time I was just kidding nostalgic about my days in Greenwich Village how interesting what if that been but thanks for being on the show yeah I hope that ended on some confusing no well we usually we just had a time darn it about to have a new show the maxim max show is with all these okay okay just google them what are you lazy are you a dumb moron Marik and he don't know how to look up the guest and find out what he does what are you a jerk you can find us on Twitter at Kaiser report lesley stahl thinks you're a moron are you a moron and that's gonna hey see you next time bye y'all
