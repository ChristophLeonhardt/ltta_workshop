and I think also like discrepancies in salaries between a couple it's also a hard thing to navigate because I mean we're pretty close but it if it was a bigger bad clothes coming up with a savings plan has been the hardest thing for the two of us come once we like kind of combine things together with a joint account and a joint credit card trying to figure out how we want to meet those long-term goals saving for our house different things like that maybe one day buying a car just all those long-term goals you have to come up with a plan how you're gonna save and manage the month month but also the year long and the two year things we came up with this number that was we said if you're spending over a hundred dollars on something that isn't a present you have to talk about it with the other person and it's a conversation and it's not merely just like the other person can approve or disapprove of it but it's more of you can talk about it like I do a lot of running races and stuff that sometimes get very expensive and we talk about like you know which races I'm gonna do for the year so that we can you know plan it out versus me just willy-nilly just like registering for you know 20 races and then all of a sudden I spent $3,000 on race entries you know we're there and most of the time it's we're like oh of course you need to spend that's what the cost of it is but it's just having that conversation just keeps both of us in the loop and there's no surprises when the bill comes and yeah just keep the communication open and I think also like discrepancies in salaries between a couple is also a hard thing to navigate because I mean we're pretty close but it close okay if it was a bigger gap I think it would be harder and I think that navigating that we're like one person thinks they can spend more than the other or whatever it might be and like figuring out what is necessary l' while like your relationship should be a 50-50 partnership like the financial relationship if one of you or one person is making a lot more than the other then it might it shouldn't be a 50/50 relationship because that's not real but also like we value a lot of the same things in life so the way we look at money is definitely similar in that way where we you know agree to spend on certain things and save in other areas because that reflects what we value as a couple yeah
