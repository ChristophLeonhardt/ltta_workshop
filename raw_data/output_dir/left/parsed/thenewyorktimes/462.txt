We treat this place and
those objects 
as historical documents.
I believe it is very
important to keep this
and to let the visitors
see it and touch it.
This is the oldest part of
this camp.
And these are buildings built 
by the forced labor
of Soviet prisoners of war,
during 1941 and '42.
One of the most serious 
reasons for deterioration
is a very poor manufacturing
technique.
The buildings in Birkenau,
they were built in a very fast
way, in very bad conditions.
There is no memorial that
will give you
the image of the conditions
in the camp.
You can only see it by
seeing authentic buildings,
authentic space,
authentic elements.
And still what happened
in this place 
is beyond our imagination.
But at least the authentic
place
can bring you closer
to this history.
