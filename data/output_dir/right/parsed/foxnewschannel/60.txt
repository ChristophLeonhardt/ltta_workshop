AINSLEY: WITH JUST TWO WEEKS
UNTIL THE MIDTERMS, IT IS A
TIGHT, TIGHT RACE DOWN IN
THE STATE OF FLORIDA.
THE LATEST REAL CLEAR
POLITICS AVERAGE, AN AVERAGE
OF ALL THE POLLS, NOW HAS
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BILL
NELSON AHEAD OF THE G.O.P.
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT BY JUST
3 POINTS.
SO ESSENTIALLY NECK IN HECK.
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT JOINS US
NOW.
GOOD MORNING, GOVERNOR.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
>> GOOD MORNING, AINSLEY.
I'M HEADING BACK OUT TO
THREE IMPACTED COUNTIES IN
THE PANHANDLE TODAY.
WE STILL HAVE 60,000 PEOPLE
WITHOUT POWER.
THIS HURRICANE WAS LIKE A
GIGANTIC TORNADOES WITH
14-FOOT STORM SURGE.
JUST DISSEMINATED OUR
PANHANDLE.
SO, RIGHT NOW I'M CONTINUING
TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE GET
THEIR POWER BACK.
GET THEIR CELL PHONE SERVICE
BACK.
MAKE SURE THEY HELP REBUILD
THEIR HOUSES.
WE HAVE GOT OVER 70,000
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SIGNED
UP FOR FEMA AND WE ARE
TRYING TO WORK WITH
ORGANIZED STATE, FEDERAL AND
LOCAL RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE
KEEP HELPING THESE FAMILIES.
AINSLEY: WHAT'S YOUR MIND
SET WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING
HURRICANE FAMILIES.
YOU HAVE BILL NELSON GO OUT
AND CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW.
WHILE YOU ARE GOVERNOR YOU
HAVE TO BE ON THE GROUND
HELPING THOSE FAMILIES.
DOLLS
DOESS
DOES HE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.
>> THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT
I GREW UP IN A VERY POOR
FAMILY IN THE MIDWEST.
I REMEMBER MY MOM, A SINGLE
MOM, WHAT WOULD SHE WANT IF
THIS HAPPENED WHERE SHE WAS
LIVING, IF A TORNADO CAME
THROUGH AND THAT'S WHAT I
THINK ABOUT.
I THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE
FAMILIES.
SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THEY HAVE FOOD AND WATER, A
TARP TO, YOU KNOW, COVER
THEIR HOUSE.
THEY GET FEMA BENEFITS.
THEY GET BACK TO WORK.
GET THEIR COMPANIES OPEN.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT.
MY OPPONENT IS JUST
FASCINATING.
HE DID A COUPLE PHOTO OPS.
THERE IS NOTHING CAN I DO.
IF YOU NEED ME, GIVE ME A
CALL.
IT'S FEMA.
IT'S A FEDERAL RESPONSE
ORGANIZATION.
HE COULD BE HELPFUL WITH
THAT.
HE COULD BE HELPFUL WITH
TYNDALL.
TYNDALL WAS DISSEMINATED.
THAT'S PROBABLY OVER 20,000
JOBS, 11,000 PEOPLE WORKING
ON TYNDALL, ALL THOSE
FAMILIES, HE JUST TURNS HIS
BACK TO THEM SAYS OH, I'M
NOT WORRY ABOUT YOU.
BILL NELSON IS WORRIED ABOUT
ONE PERSON'S JOB, HIS JOB.
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING.
THIS MY WIFE IS ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
NOT SOMETHING SHE HE WANTED
TO DO.
I TOLD HER I WANTED TO RUN
FOR GOVERNOR 8 YEARS AGO.
SHE SAID THAT'S GREAT.
I'M SCARED OF GIVING PUBLIC
SPEECHES.
BUT THAT'S WHAT SHE IS DOING
EVERY DAY NOW.
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.
AINSLEY: LET'S TALK ABOUT.
SO ISSUES.
YOU ARE BEHIND IN THE POLLS
JUST BY 3 POINTS.
BILL NELSON, HIS MAIN
DRIVERS OF HIS LEAD
APPARENTLY ARE WOMEN,
BLACKS, HISPANICS,
INDEPENDENT VOTERS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS?
>> SURE.
YOU KNOW, THE -- WE WILL WIN
FOR THIS REASON.
IT'S GOING TO BE WHO CARES
ABOUT YOU.
IT'S GOING TO BE DO YOU WANT
TO ELECT SOMEBODY LIKE
SENATOR NELSON BEEN IN
OFFICE 42 YEARS AND DONE
NOTHING AND ELECT SOMEBODY
LIKE RICK SCOTT WHO WILL
SHOW UP AND DO HIS JOB?
DO YOU CARE ABOUT A JOB?
WE HAVE ADDED 1.6 MILLION
JOBS SINCE I GOT ELECTED.
CARE ABOUT EDUCATION RECORD
EDUCATION FUNDING.
CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.
RECORD ENVIRONMENTAL
FUNDING.
SENATOR BILL NELSON HAS DONE
NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
OTHER THAN RUN AN AD.
AINSLEY: CONGRATULATIONS ON
THE JOB GAINS.
WE WERE REPORTING ON
DIFFERENT STATES YOURS THIS
SEPTEMBER COMPARED TO LAST
SEPTEMBER 407,000 GAINS.
1.6 SINCE HAVE YOU
1.6 SINCE YAVE YOU

VOTE.
