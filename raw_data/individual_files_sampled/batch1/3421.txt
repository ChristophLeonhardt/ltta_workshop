the next big thing for Facebook is graph search which is a huge improvement in their search feature for example we can try searching for friends who work at Business Insider and seconds later it'll come up with an accurate list of my Facebook work colleagues or we can try photos I like and there you go but graph search is still in beta so if I wanted to do a search or restaurants my friends like I only get a limited sample of restaurants my friends actually like because Facebook doesn't have enough data yet same goes for Facebook locations if you don't use the check-in feature limited results overall though Facebook Graph search is a great new feature but only time will tell if it will really become Facebook's next big hit
