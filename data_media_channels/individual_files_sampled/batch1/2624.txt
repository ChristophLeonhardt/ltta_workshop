where does your ecommerce stuff come from we're talking to Susan line CEO of gilt groupe Susan you're gonna do two hundred million dollars in revenue this year what happens at those warehouses how do you get all that stuff to people well we've got a big picking and packing team out of the at the brooklyn naval yards but we just started working with another company and and we opened a second warehouse up in Andover Mass that uses the Kiva robots which if you haven't seen them are incredibly cool they do the picking part of the pick and pack and they use 2d barcodes to figure out where the product is and they are constantly moving around the space bringing the goods to the packer so it's incredibly efficient so there's a huge warehouse huge was just stuff all over the place yeah you've got these little boxes run around is there a central brain somewhere that tells them where to head yeah to find and I can't tell you what that is so there's a central brain that knows these little boxes right and they look yeah they find the barcode I don't look they find the barcode on the floor sunday they are sensing it where it is and they bring that pallet over lots of stuff without just a daughter absolutely lots of stuff in it and the packer picks one of those and it goes into the box and meanwhile there's another keeper robot bringing the next item so it's very quick it's very efficient you don't lose goods nobody's allowed in that space except the robots so you get them scurrying all over the place they crash into each other never you don't have robot accidents never never and so when you're selling dresses lots of different sizes is there a different palette / sighs uh you know what that's a very good question and I'm not the person to answer my guess is yes and it hands you the palette do you say thank you or anything where did you just go away no they take breaks they just move and it's really interesting to watch because they never bump into each other because they can sense when they're close to another one and it is programmed so that the item that is needed first gets the right of way and you watch these things they move it's like a dance and if you were in there where they smash into you or they sent you to well you're not allowed to move into that is just the keynote robot space robot space and so how are they powered gifted plug them in at night charge them up again good question how much do they cost a lot they do yeah yeah yeah like what is a great company actually Zappos uses them to and you should get them on I'm sure they'd be happy to explain so they ever blow it and bring you the wrong stuff and what do you do if that happens it it it is so rare for there to be an error with the robots humans are much more prone to error right so somebody puts the wrong bar code on it brings to the wrong stack so you've got the robot sitting there no it's the wrong stuff did you have a conversation with it say even try the one next door you send somebody in to the racetrack where they're all its I I don't even know if it's ever happened to be honest so you know as long as it's it's received correctly you don't have a problem on the robot level great Thank You Susan
