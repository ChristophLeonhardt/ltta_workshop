hundreds of thousands of people are marching in cities across the u.s. against President Trump's immigration cracked up more than 700 rallies have been taking place in towns and cities throughout Saturday from New York and Washington DC to Los Angeles the people are speaking out against the separation of migrant families on the us-mexico border more than 2000 children have been taken away from their parents after entering the u.s. since April according to data from the Department of Homeland Security they are yet to be reunited with their families despite president Trump's promise to end the policy let's cross live now to Steve malls Berg who's a conservative TV and radio host Steve thanks for being with us here on Rt International so there is clearly a massive backlash against to Trump's policies but we have seen in the past that no matter how many protests are they don't really make a dent in what he thinks do you think that these will have any impact no I don't know as a matter of fact they won't have the impact that the protesters are looking for which is to make Trump into a villain into a bad guy they don't tell you the news media is is not telling you that Obama did something very similar back in 2014 he separated many many children from their parents and some of them back to Mexico while their parents were still here sent others to the northeastern part of the United States and there are pictures of them sleeping in the same conditions that the Trump administration has some kids sleeping now but the media I've never puts anything in context I call that fake news by omission as for the protests these protests are way way way out of hand the American people don't want people crossing the border with impunity now what Trump did at first but zero tolerance policy was following the law and if you came here illegally not through a checkpoint but illegally seeking asylum they were going to arrest you but you can't arrest somebody with your kids and put you in a holding cell with your kids so they separated the kids so Trump changed under pressure and said okay now the families could stay together under arrest and now they're saying oh you can't keep kids in sales so their goal is just total immunity break the law enter the country illegally and go about your way that's what these people really want well this month you alluded to this just a second ago but Trump promised to end the separations policy still there hasn't been anything done to reunite around the 2,000 children with their parents also a judge has ordered that to take place 14 days for kids under the age of five and within 30 days for kids older than five why do you think there's a delay here I think bureaucracy plays a big part I think Barack Barack bureaucracy and also you know getting the kid where are you gonna put the kids especially the ones under five are you gonna put them in the holding cell with the parents or you go to some degree to let the parents go free oh yeah I mean you Trump can't win here nobody there's a court order and they say they're doing their best to straighten it out but when push comes to shove these protesters protested like I said at the beginning when they were separated and now protests the fact that Trump signed an executive order saying they'll be together in custody they want these families free to enter the United States illegally and roam around the country until their time to sue a period Court comes up and that's unacceptable to the American people all right Steve mosburger interesting to hear your thoughts always a pleasure conservative TV and radio host right here on our to Internet thank you you
