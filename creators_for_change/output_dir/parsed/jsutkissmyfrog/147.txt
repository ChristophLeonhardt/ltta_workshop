this is where I live these are the
curtains I die too often here are the
windows I smudge with black who the
gramophone I often get bored off the
records I own his bits I've been looking
after for a really long time and there's
corners I've always neglected for some
reason sometimes I'm really in the mood
to hear what people think about where I
live safe in the knowledge that feedback
isn't always a necessity that sometimes
where you live is just where you live
there's always ornaments to buy layers
of paint to be licked on but at the end
of the day it's yours you've got the
keys you can invite in exactly who you
want
