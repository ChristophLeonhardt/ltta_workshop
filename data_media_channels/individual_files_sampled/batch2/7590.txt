so Customs and Border Patrol Customs and Border Protection's seized $41,000 from a nigerian-born Texas woman in October of last year she was passing through the Houston Airport on her way to start a medical clinic in her home country here are some more details on that so Antonio nori is her name a 59 year old nurse was never charged with a crime and CPB never pursued civil forfeiture proceedings against her but the agency is nevertheless refusing to return the funds which nori spent years saving up unless she signs a so-called hold harmless agreement forfeiting her right to sue and forcing her to reimburse the government for costs incurred in the enforcement of any part of this agreement according to a report in The Texas Tribune so this all came about because she failed to report that she was carrying more than ten thousand dollars in violation of federal law now the Institute for justice a Virginia based public interest law firm has since filed a class-action lawsuit last Thursday on Nora's behalf challenging the government's authority to require that a citizen sign away their right to sue before the money is returned so this is what they have to say about that we're representing hundreds or thousands of people all over the country who have had this sort of thing happened to them Dan Albin one of the attorneys litigating the case told the Tribune they were entitled to get their property back and instead CPB sent them this letter demanding that they waive all rights to sue and hold the government harmless and if they violate the agreement they pay all attorneys fees that's just egregious this is actually part of a growing national debate with regards to civil asset forfeiture I actually listen to a surprisingly interesting take from CPAC in 2007 to the federal federal law enforcement agent was speaking against the practice so I've learned from all both sides about why they don't like this many people who have had their property seized never get their day in court as the authorities are entitled to keep what is confiscated under a process known as administrative forfeiture so long as the government is not challenged in court a rare occurrence considering the socioeconomic status of many subjected to the policy according to IJ attorneys they can retain the seized property indefinitely without ever charging the property's rightful owner with a crime so a lot of people are saying this absolutely unconstitutional this is a government overreach what do you guys say okay so first of all National Review in case you don't know is conservative CPAC is conservative and so you're right conservatives and progressives for the I don't know if it's the first time but among the very very limited time is it agree yeah steady should fly out that's right finally some sane agreement so of course this the same people in the country agree on this issue we've lost the government says no we're just gonna steal your property and even if you did nothing wrong and it like in this case we decided like why do they have you just a quick aside why do they have your report the ten thousand dollars coming in because they don't want guys coming in with a suitcase full of money that their money laundering or using for the drug trade etc so there's a logical reason why they want you to report it but once they find out that's not why you brought it in and it's actually your money in the past they would let you go 100 percent of the time they say oh okay you're a nurse and you're opening up a medical clinic and you can prove it ok then you get your money back but because of these laws now they go you're right you did nothing wrong so we're not gonna charge you you're there's no charges you're free to go but I just like to steal your money anyway so I'm just gonna steal it and then you like and over ninety percent of the time they get to keep it and it's but why because most people don't have resource to go find a lawyer and to be able to sue them to get their money back which regular guy in the middle of the country has enough money to sue the federal government to get your money back oh you know it has to be a large enough number that he'd even be worth it let's say they took 750 bucks off you they just took it from your wallet cuz you had a joint on you right not related to the border but having to do with and by the way she's a US citizen right inside the country they could do this just as much all you got to join in your car forget the $750 I'm gonna take your car and your car is not that great it's worth $3500 it's not worth the lawyer well too bad you're never gonna get it back okay we just stole it and it's gone so that's why real conservatives think that that is big government coming in and doing something wrong to you progressives say that's big government unconstitutional overreach you need to protect our rights and government goes yeah on the other hand I'd like the money so I'm just gonna take it yeah and further what are you gonna do about it that's it there's just like what are you gonna do about it and your recourse in theory is to sue not only do you have the financial barrier that for most people but also they issue you this statement saying we'll give you your money back even if you and and if we give it to you you can't sue us and the only way we're going to even this limited possible scenario give you your money back is if you sign this thing saying you promise you won't be mad but not only that it's actually slightly worse it's grace read to you there not only do you have to give away your rights but they say and we can take administrative costs out well how much were your administrative costs so if you sign it they could turn around and go oh well as luck would have it we had to have lawyers to give you this piece of paper etc and our administrative cost you know we're the big federal government we're thirty nine thousand dollars so here's two thousand back and if you wanted to contest that you couldn't because you've already in that scenario signed the waiver saying you're not gonna sue its Regis but think about this grace at least at least the government did its job and made sure that this woman does not set up a medical clinic in Nigeria thank God imagine if she did that imagine if a medical care because it's so ridiculous yeah I think another thing is is just sort of the burden of proof that and the onus that comes onto the person who's had something taken from them so for example so you have to prove the legality of the money now that sounds I guess easy enough or sometimes it's not as easy say to your you know raising funds from like bake sales or whatever you will need to substantiate to customs satisfaction that the money came from a legitimate legal source to do this you will need to collect transaction statements tax havens vague statements pay stubs or any other documentation of the money source and by the way you better do it within that 30-day window in which you have to reply to the notice the notice of seizure so it's it's the system is absolutely stacked against the people who are get their their civil assets seized from them and I think that it's refreshing that this seems to be a bipartisan issue or you can agree oh this is wrong because then perhaps there could be some sort of some sort of change but even with the speech that I was listening to that took place at CPAC and this was about a year ago so this is 2017 the guy was saying you know a friend of mine presented this and it couldn't he couldn't even bring it to assembly because if the government is just taking such a strong hold when it comes to this policy yeah theoretically they can actually take your house if they find a single illegal activity in the house including a joint in a lot of the states yeah so now but that analogy is not exactly right because it's actually worse than that let's say they stop you and they think you have drugs in your car they dogs smell drugs in your car or whatever scenario killed the dog kill the dog or by the way the cop the cop sniff drugs and you could say that right I smelled marijuana coming from the car they can seize your car and then go oh we didn't find any drugs it doesn't matter we slob your car so what I'm not gonna give it back that's the law that's the law so even if you're totally innocent by the way they shouldn't be able to seize your car or your assets even if you were guilty we have a whole criminal justice system to punish you for crimes and there's no reason in the world on top of that we should be able to steal your property so look a concern was I sometimes I'm sorry to do the rift again here a little bit but it's they have a fantasy this mythology that liberals want love big government and they want to control your lives no no I think I'm gonna butt out of our lives that's why we believe in civil liberties and rights and the Constitution so please get rid of that old nonsense mythology and let's all work together to actually fix our government in in ways that we actually tangibly can and yes one of the tenants of progressivism is that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and that is again something that real American conservatives and liberals can agree on
