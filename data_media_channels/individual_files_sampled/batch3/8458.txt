Shannon: TODAY IS PRIMARY DAY IN FOUR STATES ACROSS THE U.S. MOST EYES ON PENNSYLVANIA IN THE WAKE OF THOSE NEWLY DRAWN CONGRESSIONAL MAPS THERE. IT LIKELY TO BENEFIT DEMOCRATS AND THEIR EFFORTS TO FLIP THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE HOUSE. ERIC SHAWN IS LIVE WITH US ON THE GROUND IN HAZLETON TONIGHT WITH THE LATEST RESULTS. GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING, SHANNON. IT'S A HISTORIC NIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, AT LEAST EIGHT WOMEN HAVE WON THEIR NOMINATIONS FOR CONGRESS ACROSS THE STATE ON BOTH THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN LINE. THERE IS SOME DISAPPOINTING NEWS FOR RICK'S ACCOUNT, REMEMBER HIM? THE REPUBLICAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE WHO WAS NARROWLY DEFEATED BY CONNOR LAMB AND A SPECIAL ELECTION TWO MONTHS AGO NEAR PITTSBURGH. HE LOST HIS PRIMARY REPUBLICAN BATTLE TONIGHT TO ANOTHER CANDIDATE IN ANOTHER DISTRICT. WHEN ASKED FOR THE U.S. SENATE RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA, IT IS GOING TO BE A DOOZY BECAUSE TONIGHT FOR TERM CUMBERLAND DEFEATED JIM CRISTIANO WHICH WILL SET UP A MAJOR BATTLE FOR DEMOCRATIC SENATOR . A SELF-MADE BUSINESSMAN, MAYOR OF HAZLETON, HE MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES BACK IN 2006 FOR HIS TOUGH STANCE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. HE WAS ENDORSED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO ACTUALLY URGED HIM TO RUN FOR THE STATE AND TONIGHT HE LIKENS HIS CANDIDACY TO THAT OF THE PRESIDENT'S. HE SAID HE'S REACHING OUT TO REAGAN DEMOCRATS. HE CALLS HIMSELF A BLUE-COLLAR WORKING-CLASS GUY WHO WILL FIGHT FOR PENNSYLVANIANS NOTING THAT KC FREQUENTLY BOTH WITH SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, WHICH HE SAID MAKES HER A GREAT SENATOR FOR CALIFORNIA OR MASSACHUSETTS, BUT NOT PENNSYLVANIA. HE SAID SHE DOES NOT HAVE THE VALUES OF THE KEYSTONE STATE. THE MEDIA SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD NOT WIN IN PENNSYLVANIA. IN PENNSYLVANIA SENT DONALD TRUMP TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT I WOULD NEVER BE MAYOR AND I WAS MAYOR FOR THREE TERMS. THEY ALSO TOLD ME I WOULD NEVER BEAT A 26 ARE IN COMMON AND WOULD BE TO 26 YEAR AND COME IN AND IN AND OUT THERE SAYING THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE BOB CASEY WE ARE GOING TO BE BOB CASEY. CASEY IS A THREE TERM INCUMBENT. HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR 12 YEARS. THE SON OF STORY TO FORMER GOVERNOR ROBERT P CASEY. HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE HARSHEST CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENT, HAS URGED HIM TO RESIGN OVER THOSE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. HIS CAMPAIGN ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT SET APART THIS ELECTION WILL BE A CHOICE FOR A CANDIDATE THAT FIGHTS FOR INTERESTS THAT STACK THE DECK AGAINST THEM. TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND A CANDIDATE WHO HAS SPENT YEARS TO UNDERMINE, PRIVATIZE OR/THOSE PROGRAMS. IT WILL BE A CHOICE BETWEEN A CANDIDATE WHO STANDS UP TO PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN IS WRONG AND A CANDIDATE WHO BELIEVES PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN DO NO WRONG. FROM FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL COLLEGE SAYS AT LEAST FOR NOW CASEY, IT SEEMS, HAS THE EDGE. HE'S KEPT THE CONNECTION TO THE WORKING CLASS, UNLIKE A LOT OF OTHER SORT OF URBAN DEMOCRATS OF OTHER SORT OF URBAN DEMOCRAT DEMOCRATS. I ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT CASEY IS FROM SCRANTON. IF YOU ARE FROM SCRANTON YOU ARE NOT AN URBAN DEMOCRAT. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WORKING CLASS TOWN. BOTTOM LINE I THINK THE SENATOR IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO BEAT. PART OF THAT WORKING-CLASS THING THAT HE JUST TALKED ABOUT IS THE SIGN. LOOK AT THE SIGNAGE. IT JUST SAYS ONE WORD, BLUE, NOT THE LAST NAME. HE SAYS BEFORE THIS ELECTION IS OVER EVERY PENNSYLVANIAN WILL KNOW AND LIKE LOU. BACK TO YOU. Shannon: I GUESS IT'S LIKE
