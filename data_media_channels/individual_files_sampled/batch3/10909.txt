time now for the second in a series of reports on the fate of Russian families who left for Syria to fight for Islamic state Arty's between a caution of a travel to southern Russia to talk to a woman convicted to eight years in prison on terrorism charges it's after she followed her husband to Syria the clock is ticking on Zagat's current life sentenced to eight years behind bars for being part of an illegal armed group she won't actually go to jail until her youngest child turns 14 and she's only 1 right now less than 12 months ago her life was all very different I was 29 when I left I went to Turkey first with my husband I never thought I would end up there within seven months segi dad was living in Syria and pregnant with her third child she says her husband had been drawn to Islam and a better life he told me it was safe to go there he said it wasn't how it was being shown there was no bombing he said no war but the reality turned out to be far worse than anything on TV they lived for two years in the city of tadka which at the times was under isil's control then they moved to Raqqa and she spent every day living in fear even my girl knew she was only eight years old but she could tell the difference what was coming an American her cues explain a fighter jet a drone she could tell by the sound were they hiding yes well they either went downstairs or just simply stayed at home they took them out into the hall and we laid on the floor so that any shrapnel wouldn't hit us Shagga dad struggles to share her story she tries to stay emotionally distant from the past speaks quietly rarely looking into the camera she says she wanted to return home right from the start I told my husband that I want to go back that I couldn't live it but the moment I started talking about it we had fights he told me if you want to leave leave but I will not let you take the kids away I knew he was able to do that he had that sort of character and I was afraid later on when they were living in Raqqa her husband was killed in a drone strike leaving zaggy dad all alone with three children I started looking for ways to get out but it's not that easy you can't just leave that place it all has to be done in secret there are people that can sell you out tricky I only talked to those who I knew well and one day I was told that there was this road that there was a way out segi dad claims she had no idea the life she was leading would leave her on the wrong side of Russia's anti-terror laws I stayed at home all the time I had my children I had no time for anything else I was at home taking care of my kids she was one of the seven women and 14 children brought back to Russia in the autumn 2017 as part of a campaign organized by Chechen officials to repatriate the families of men who went to fight with Islamic terrorists I'm very grateful to everyone who helped launch this campaign save many women and children but while they were lucky to escape from the war in Syria upon arrival in Grozny she was detained by police three months later she was convicted and sentenced for being part of an illegal armed group and while the law she broke is designed to help war terror attacks some people argue that family members of radicalized individuals should not be targeted these people need rehabilitation they need to be close to their family members under the care of their mothers they're under huge stress and prison will not help them it would only make them more harsh I believe it's wrong to put them behind bars for now ziege dead leaves with her mother in Dagestan she has to report to the police every month and can't leave the region it's difficult for both her and her brother to find work as there on the official police list it means they all have to get by on their mother's small salary as a post office worker despite all this Zeki dad says she's just happy to see her children safe I was literally suffering there because I was unable to provide food for my children they told me constantly mom we are hungry they were crying and now he says let's go to the merry-go-round let's go to the seaside let me go everywhere don't do now we go everywhere mummy's heart and soul my lovely Hosea bhaijan equational RT Dagestan and with the question of how to treat so-called ISIL wives proving divisive we decided to debate the issue with our guests this shouldn't be allowed to return home they have left the safety of this country and gone away to fight with Isis with - whatever you want to call them and they should not be allowed back into this country what are they gonna do when to come back here you know we've got enough people in our prisons now radicalize in our youth if you break a law especially criminal laws in England and you break it somewhere else you can actually charge but that charge has actually to stand in court we're not responsible for the action that their husbands or their or their kids or their son that took as a terrorist this is not the responsibility they made that decision now to say that there went out there didn't know what those going out there so didn't know what the husband's was doing that he's absolutely ridiculous there was radicalized they've gone out there if the culture that they're in at the moment has a death sentence so be it that's up to them but we cannot just charge anyone because we look we think she was she was a wife who she knew about everything she cannot make a decision some of them there were soldiers some other were recruit yes we agree on this but let's differentiate between innocent and being who's been a terrorist and husband a criminal this is very critical because we don't wanna go the cycle of violence again their own decisions on life please tell me this husband said to their wives where there was going was he went out shopping was going out to a holiday somewhere I tell you exactly what was going on all right I'll give you an example he tells his wife we go into a trip a holiday to Turkey okay let's see why and that's how he started sometimes we go to a holiday to Turkey to South the turkey in Turkey you're stuck we go into Syria why because this is what Islam is asking us to this is what we have to fight you or my wife you have to listen to me if not I'll divorce you and you have papers how are you going to turn back home if you take your wife to rock her old places like this and you tell her I'm taking a path away from home and would not allow that to happen there made that decision now to say that there went out there didn't know what those going out there so didn't know what the husband's was doing that he's absolutely ridiculous there was radicalized they've gone out there if the country that they're in at the moment has a bet sentence so be it that's up to them they've made that decision they've gone out there we do not want these people back here a series looking at the fallout of Russian families going to fight in Syria continues on Friday with a look at people still trying to locate friends and relatives who pledged allegiance to ISIL it was on Monday that we showed you the story of two Russian sisters found in an Iraqi orphanage you can now watch that in full on our T's youtube channel you you
