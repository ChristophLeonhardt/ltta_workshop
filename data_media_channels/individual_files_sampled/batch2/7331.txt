we're very excited to have back on to the show Jamie Cromwell and famila Malik and they're currently there they are hello well guys show all right it's great to have you back on and familiar you're currently running for state Senate in New York and sheets chair of the protect Orange County it's the group that's leading the fight against the CPV plant and just so you know what's happened most recently is that well James Cromwell and Pramila have been protesting the CPV power plant construction for a while now but what just happened is XA two New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was recently found guilty of taking three hundred thousand dollars in bribes and most of them coming from the CPV power plant plant so welcome to our guests and tell us could just so last time we talked oh this is is this is a positive development that he's gonna be going to jail and now Cynthia Nixon who is running against Andrew Cuomo from - from on his left is now also talking about this issue that has to make you excited right um it does I mean it's it's definitely a positive development there's definitely a lot of pressure on the company but you know I was at the trial every day and what I realized after sitting there every day and watching this is how ubiquitous the corruption is um there are a hundred and different ways in which these lobbyists and these big moneyed interest buy our politicians the campaign donations are just one form what we learned through the trial in this trial the company executive for this power plant apparently gave Joseph Percoco Governor Cuomo's closest aides wife a no-show job for about $7,500 a month and that lasted four years and apparently that now is the most common way that lobbyists and these big companies now are corrupting our elected official is by offering their spouses no-show jobs so that's apparently become a thing nationally but this company this company CPV this is what they do everywhere they go and they're building power plants throughout the country so you know the media kind of just ran with this narrative that it was all Cuomo and it was all corruption um at in his office but you know what you really learn is that it's bipartisan corruption and the corruption is ubiquitous and it's not only plagues our government and has usurped our government but also many of the institutions that we rely on to safeguard the public trust like for example the media there's clearly there was a media blackout with this story because the media so far nobody has covered the power plant at the center of the corruption trial which is very bewildering especially because the the company's name and the power plant were referenced virtually every couple of minutes throughout this eight-week trial so you're telling me that while the media is covering the corruption aspect this because it's kind of sexy somebody took a payout but they're not actually covering the problem which is the CPB power plant is that what you're saying they're covering the quid but they're not covering the quo so they are covering the fact that this person got this state official high-level state official was bribed but they're not covering what he was bribed for he was bribed not only for the permits for this really dangerous frack gas power plant but for changes in state energy policy and what they did in New York State they are actually doing on a national level and there were references to that in in the trial that they are not only lobbying and corrupting the process in New York State but also nationally they're very active they were very active in advocating for the clean power plan they're also active and initiate a lot of changes with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's policies on rate regulation so they are creating policies that are making us pay for their infrastructures and toxic infrastructure projects and all of these are going to have consequences for generations I mean energy policy truly is our climate policy but it's also our public health policy and it's our environmental policy and all of that was sacrifice all of that was compromised for this bribery money and the media is not covering the biggest part of the story which is which are the victims of the crime our our community in Orange County are the victims of the crime and you know just as this power plant I mean just as this trial became underway in January of 2018 the power plant actually fired up and people from as far as eight to ten miles away we're getting sick yet nobody from the New York Times or The Washington Post or Politico or anywhere covered that and that you know and I sat next to a lot of these reporters and every day I would after listening to testimony about how this company sought to corrupt state officials I would tell them well do you know that they just fired up do you know that people are getting sick do you know that you know that that odors are us are being smelled and felt from miles and miles around do you know that an entire environmental city filled with environmental justice communities is being engulfed and they were not at all interested in in those in that aspect of the story and there's it's really hard to explain it other than corruption and backdoor influence so the power plant the CPB power plant now the problems you have is that is not only that the pollution of it right there but isn't it because it's powered pipe for it's a frack gas power plant and that's and they don't get the frack gas from inside New York State correct they get it from are they getting it from Pennsylvania and they have to transport it is that what's happening yeah they get the guests from towns like Dimmick which are whichever this the county of demikhov's in this county this power plant alone will need a hundred and fifty new wells every year and the infrastructure that goes along with those wells the compressor stations all the pipelines and it is ruining the entire eastern part of Pennsylvania destroying agriculture killing animals people are leaving their homes all the devastation of the infrastructure other than the leakage that occurs in the pipeline and the emissions from the plant are where the gas is frakked and that will be ruined and forever if you enjoyed this clip of aggressive progressives you know there's a 90-minute show waiting for you
