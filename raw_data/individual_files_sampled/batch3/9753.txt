Sean: MORE REACTION TO TONIGHT'S MONOLOGUE, AND AMERICA'S FIRST ACTION SENIOR ADVISOR, SEAN SPICER, AND THE AUTHOR OF A BRAND-NEW BEST SELLER, SPYGATE, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT. SEAN, I KNOW YOU WENT THROUGH A LOT WHEN THE PRESS SECRETARY, AND WORDS ARE ONE THING, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE LEADERS THE FORMER CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAYING, WE CAN'T BE CIVIL WITH THEM. WE HAVE THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE USA SAYING, KICK THEM? IF THEY GO LOW, WE KICK THEM? THEN WE HAVE MAXINE WATERS SAYING, YOU SEE THESE CABINET PEOPLE AND YOU GET A CROWD AND YOU FOLLOW THEM INTO GAS STATIONS AND GROCERY STORES. YOU SAW THAT FROM PAM BONDI, SECRETARY NIELSEN AND TED CRUZ, SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET KILLED HERE. BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND HE SHOT UP BY A OF HOUSE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS. I THINK THE CONCERN, IT ALL SEEMS TO BE WORKING IN ONE DIRECTION. INSTEAD OF DENOUNCING IT, YOU KNOW THE MEDIA WOULD BE OUT THERE ASKING THE RIGHT TO DO THAT, AND THEN YOU SEE IT DOUBLING DOWN. THESE PEOPLE ARE DOUBLING DOWN AND INCITING IT, AND IF THIS WAS THE RIGHT DOING IT TO THE LEFT, IF THESE WERE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS, THEY WOULD BE OUTRAGED ON EVERY ONE OF THOSE LEFT-WING CABLE SHOWS THAT WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IT'S OUTRAGED Sean: GO AHEAD AND FINISH. I WAS GOING TO SAY, I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A DOUBLE STANDARD. THEY JUSTIFY THE ACTIONS ON THE LEFT, HE IS ALL THE COMMENTATORS HOSTS ON CNN SAYING PLEASE DON'T CALL IT A MOB, WHICH IT CLEARLY IS. Sean: HOW DARE WE SAY IT'S A MOB. YES. Sean: "THE NEW YORK POST" ACTUALLY SAID, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WANTED. NOT ONLY PORTLAND LAST WEEKEND AND THIS WEEKEND BUT NEW YORK THIS WEEKEND AND A BUNCH OF ANARCHISTS WHICH GO TO THE NEW YORK G.O.P. CLUB, REPUBLICAN CLUB OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE. THEY ARE MEETING VANDALISM AND ANARCHISTS, SIGNS THAT THEY ARE PUTTING UP ET CETERA AND THEN THERE'S A CONFRONTATION ON THE STREET THERE. I'M KIND OF PIT STOP THAT I EVEN BELIEVE FOR A SECOND WHAT THEY WROTE. THIS IS COMING FROM THE RADICAL LEFT, BUT LOOK AT ALEC BALDWIN, THE LOWEST RATINGS IN THE HISTORY BASICALLY OF ANY NETWORK TELEVISION. IT'S NEVER BEEN THAT LOW. OR MICHAEL MOORE'S MOVIE. DOES THIS TRANSLATE TO THE BALLOT BOX IN 22 DAYS? WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THAT. WE ARE SEEING A RAISE CLOSING IN MICHIGAN. JOHN JAMES, AN INSURGENT CANDIDATE. Sean: I THINK HE'S A ROCK STAR. I LOVE HIM. IS GREAT, IS VIDEOS ARE TERRIFIC. TWO QUICK POINTS. THE LEFT'S RELIGION AND STATE POWER, THAT'S THEIR RELIGION. WHEN THEY LOSE STATE POWER, THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FALL BACK ON. THEY ARE SOCIALISTS AND THEIR RELIGION, THEY GENUFLECT AT THE ALTAR STATE POWER. YOU KNOW HOW THEY LIED AND THEY DISSEMINATED FALSE INFORMATION. ALL THE PHONY DOCUMENTS LEAKED BEFORE THE ELECTION, AND THEN IT WAS USED TO SET UP THE WHOLE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. MAXINE WATERS SAYS TO ME, DON'T SAY IT. WE WILL DO IT BUT DON'T SAY IT. NOW THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, JOHN PODESTA'S GROUP, THEY ARE NOW OUT THERE SAYING DON'T TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION. DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO. SO FOR THEM TO WIN THEY HAVE TO LIE AND HIDE WHO THEY REALLY ARE WHICH IS A PRETTY REVEALING INSTANCE. AND THEN WE HAVE THE TAPE OF PHIL BRED A SIN. IF YOU LOOK AT A CANDIDATE, IT'S CALLED THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA CRAZY. ALL OF THESE TAPES START UNRAVELING ABOUT HER TALKING ABOUT IT BEING OKAY TO JOIN THE TALIBAN. Sean: LET'S GO BACK. THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD WITH HOW THEY COVER THE RIGHT AND HOW THEY COVER THE LEFT. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS TALK ABOUT THE STYLE AND SUBSTANCE WITH DONALD TRUMP. THEY CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE CANDIDATES OR THE RESULTS BECAUSE IF THERE IS EITHER ECONOMIC POLICY OR FOREIGN POLICY. THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING THINGS DONE AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T BE WHAT HE'S GETTING DONE. Sean: I SEE THINGS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH THE SENATE, SEAN SPICER, BUT IN THE HOUSE IT'S TOO HARD TO TELL. IT'S GETTING CLOSE. IT'S CLOSER, BUT ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT THE HOUSE? A WHOLE LOT OF THEM WILL BE THEY STOP THE AGENDA DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.
