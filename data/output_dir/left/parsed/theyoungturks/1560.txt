COMEDIAN AND HOST OF THE FOOD
NETWORKS TO ENORMOUS FOODS HAD
INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY ON
TWITTER ABOUT BEING PERSECUTED
AS A STRAIGHT WHITE MALE.
I DO WANT TO PUT WORDS IN HIS
MOUTH, I WILL HAVE YOU GUYS
READ HIS TWEETS WITH ME.
>>NO DIFFERENCE IN THE USAGE.
NONE.
WELL, DO WE HAVE TO REALLY POINT
THIS OUT?
THIS GUY STARTED IT,
THE N-WORD IS WHAT THEY WERE
USED BEFORE LYNCHINGS AND
DURING SLAVERY.
I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
JOSH DENNY WAS ENSLAVED, OR
SPLIT UP HIS FAMILY, OR RAPED
HIS WIFE WHICH WOULD HAPPEN
OFTEN DURING SLAVERY.
HE HAS A TELEVISION SHOW BUT HE
IS SLIGHTLY BOTHERED WHEN OTHER
PEOPLE USE THE WORD STRAIGHT
WHITE MALE.
>>LET'S READ A LITTLE BIT MORE.
HIS FIRST TWEET WAS SO
OVER-THE-TOP.
COMPARING STRAIGHT WHITE MALE TO
THE N-WORD IS CRAZY.
IT TOOK AWAY ANY LEGITIMATE
POINT HE MIGHT HAVE IN FOLLOWING
TWEETS.
I HAVE SEEN THIS AND I DO
THINK IT IS UNFAIR.
SOMETIMES THERE WILL BE A
STRAIGHT WHITE GUY TRYING TO
MAKE A POINT AND SOMETIMES HE
WILL GET DISMISSED.
I DON'T THINK THAT IS FAIR.
BUT TO SAY WE ARE BEING
PERSECUTED, AND IT IS RACISM AND
IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT PEOPLE'S
EXPERIENCE, YOU LOSE LEGITIMACY
IN ANY ARGUMENT YOU ARE TRYING
TO MAKE.
>>I
DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE FIRED.
>>ME EITHER.
>> PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO
START THESE CONVERSATIONS AND
SOMETIMES THEY MAKE TERRIBLE
MISTAKES WHICH I THINK JOSH
MADE IN THIS CASE.
IF WE BASICALLY DO A CAREER
DEATH PENALTY FOR THESE
MISSTEPS AND EVERYBODY WILL BE
AFRAID TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
AND WE WILL NEVER GET TO
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE
HORRORS OF SLAVERY.
WE DON'T TEACH THE TRUE HORRORS
OF IT BECAUSE SOME THINGS ARE
SO UNCOMFORTABLE WE LEAVE THEM
OUT OF OUR HISTORY BOOKS.
>>ALSO YOU READ ABOUT LYNCHINGS
IN HISTORY BOOKS BUT YOU DON'T
REALLY READ ABOUT LYNCHINGS.
I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE
EVER LEARNED ABOUT HOW GRUESOME
THOSE LYNCHINGS WERE.
>>THE USED TO HAVE PICNICS ABOUT
THEM AND TAKE PARTS OF THE
BURNED BODIES AS SOUVENIRS.
BY THE WAY THAT IS NOT ALL
THE GORY DETAILS.
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT HIS FRIEND,
IAN Ã± HE INCLUDED HIM IN ONE OF
THE TWEETS.
IAN IN MY OPINION HAVE THE
BEST RESPONSE.
HE SAID, " TO BE FAIR YOU KIND
OF EMPLOYED HYPERBOLE SEWED
GRANDIOSE THAT COMPLETELY
OBSCURES ANY POINT YOU MAY HAVE
BEEN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE, YOU
BEING TOLD TO SHUT UP IS NOT THE
SAME AS A STRAIGHT WHITE PERSONS
OF OPINIONS NOT MATTERING."
THAT
IS ANOTHER GREAT POINT THERE AT
THE END.
NOBODY IS ACTUALLY SETTING YOU
UP, THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT
LOCKING YOU UP.
GUYS, DON'T ATTACK HIM FOR THAT.
LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION.
>>A DIALOGUE.
YES.
>>HOPE THIS LEADS TO SOMETHING
PRODUCTIVE, BUT IT HASN'T YET.
