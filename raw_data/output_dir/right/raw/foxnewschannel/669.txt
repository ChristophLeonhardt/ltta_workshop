RESTAURANT FOR WEARING A

00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,732
MAGA HAT.

4
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:14,366
NOW, MORE ATTACKS AGAINST

5
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:16,201
THE RIGHT.

6
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,102
PETE: A MAN IN FLORIDA

7
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:18,503
CLAIMING HE WAS ASSAULTED

8
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:19,671
BECAUSE THE DRIVER SAW A

9
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:21,606
TRUMP FLAG IN HIS YARD AND

10
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:24,943
ABBY: ALSO THIS:  A NEW YORK

00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:25,477
MAN ARRESTED AFTER

12
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:26,511
THREATENING TO KILL

13
00:00:26,512 --> 00:00:28,713
SUPPORTERS OF A REPUBLICAN

14
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:29,314
CONGRESSMAN, AS WELL AS

15
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:29,814
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

16
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:32,317
SO WHAT IS BEHIND ALL OF

17
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:32,683
THIS?

18
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:33,718
ED: HERE TO REACT, FORMER

19
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,186
GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS, FOX

20
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:36,321
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MIKE

21
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:36,688
HUCKABEE.

22
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:37,555
GOOD MORNING, SIR.

23
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,691
ABBY: GOOD MORNING, ALL.

24
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:40,892
PETE: AS I SEE THIS PLAY

25
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:41,993
OUT, IT ALL STARTED WITH

26
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:43,128
YOUR DAUGHTER TRYING TO GO

27
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:47,565
TO A RESTAURANT HAVE DINNER.

28
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:48,433
I SEE YOU SMILING BECAUSE AT

29
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:49,734
THE TIME WE THOUGHT OH, THIS

30
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:50,635
IS KIND OF SILLY.

31
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:51,936
SIR, IT'S GOTTEN QUITE

32
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:53,138
SERIOUS SINCE THEN.

33
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:54,472
>> WELL, IT ACTUALLY STARTED

34
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,908
WITH THE ELECTION.

35
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,278
GOVERNMENT, THE ONE THING

36
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:01,613
THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THAT

37
00:01:01,614 --> 00:01:03,281
GOVERNMENT TO SURVIVE IS

38
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:04,949
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ACCEPT

39
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,318
THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION.

40
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,752
AND WHAT WE HAVE HAD SINCE

41
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:10,488
NOVEMBER OF 2016 IS THAT THE

42
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,524
LOSING SIDE HAS NOT ACCEPTED

43
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:13,658
THE RESULT.

44
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,928
MOMENT THIS HAS HAPPENED,

45
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:18,863
THEY TRIED TO NOT ONLY

46
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:19,731
DELEGITIMIZE THE ELECTION

47
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:21,399
ITSELF, BUT THEY TRIED TO

48
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,600
COMMIT ACTS OF TERROR.

49
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:24,369
AND I USE THAT WORD VERY

50
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,807
BEHAVIOR, BY INTIMIDATION,

51
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:30,475
BY THREATS OF VIOLENCE AND

52
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:32,143
BY ACTUAL VIOLENCE AND BY

53
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:37,582
BOYCOTTING THEM AND BY

54
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,950
TAKING AWAY THEIR LIBERTY.

55
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:39,884
THAT'S TERRORISM.

56
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:40,952
WHAT WE ARE SEE SOMETHING A

57
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:42,120
FORM OF TERRORISM ON THE

58
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:42,987
LEFT UNPRECEDENTED IN

59
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:43,922
AMERICAN HISTORY.

60
00:01:43,923 --> 00:01:45,623
IT'S FINE TO DISAGREE WITH

61
00:01:45,624 --> 00:01:46,124
ELECTION RESULTS.

62
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:49,260
I SAY IT'S FINE.

63
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:49,928
IT'S REALLY NOT.

64
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,196
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

65
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:52,564
DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.

66
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:55,333
THIS DESTROYS OUR COUNTRY.

67
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,468
PETE: GOVERNOR IS, THERE

68
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:57,535
ANOTHER INGREDIENT TO IT

69
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:57,869
TOO?

70
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,971
YOU SAY DELEGITIMIZE.

71
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:01,740
HOW ABOUT DEHUMANIZE?

72
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,641
THIS IDEA OF WEARING A MAGA

73
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,146
YOU ARE IMPUGNING THE

74
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:08,545
SUPPORTERS.

75
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:09,547
AT SOME POINT THAT GIVES YOU

76
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,116
LICENSE TO CONFRONT IN ANY

77
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:12,517
WAY.

78
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:14,185
>> WELL, IT'S VERY MUCH A

79
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:15,653
PART OF IT I MEAN, WHEN YOU

80
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:18,156
HAVE ANCHORS LIKE JOE

81
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:18,757
SCARBOROUGH SAYING THAT

82
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:19,958
ANYONE WHO VOTED FOR AND/OR

83
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,459
SUPPORTED THE PRESIDENT IS A

84
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,793
RACIST.

85
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:23,561
THAT IS A RIDICULOUS

86
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:24,429
STATEMENT ON ITS FACE HE

87
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,797
SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED FOR

88
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:26,631
THAT.

89
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:27,298
CERTAINLY SUSPENDED AND

90
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:28,299
FORCED TO APOLOGIZE.

91
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,268
WHEN YOU HAD THE PANELIST

92
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,203
SAY THAT ANYONE WHO

93
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:33,371
SUPPORTED, THIS IS DONNY

94
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:35,240
DEUTSCH WHO SAID IF YOU

95
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:41,880
GOING TO THAT LEVEL, THAT

96
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,814
EXTREME OF ATTEMPTING TO AS

97
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,716
YOU SAY AND I AGREE

98
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,487
OUT OF CONTROL.

99
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:50,422
ABBY: YEAH, GOVERNOR, THIS

100
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:51,623
IS WHEN LEADERSHIP TRULY

101
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:52,123
MATTERS, RIGHT?

102
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:53,258
TO YOUR POINT, THAT'S WHEN

103
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,359
YOU NEED THE FOLKS AT THE

104
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,195
THIS.

105
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:59,364
THIS GOES WELL BEYOND THE

106
00:02:59,365 --> 00:02:59,664
PALE.

107
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:00,965
BUT WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT

108
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:01,299
HAPPEN.

109
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,100
WHAT IS THE ANSWER?

110
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,735
HOW DO WE GET TO A BETTER

111
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:09,607
INCREASINGLY WORSE AS THE

112
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,543
MID TERMS HEAT UP AND THEN

113
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:12,944
2020, HOW MANY MORE MAGA

114
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:16,915
HOW DO WE CALM THIS DOWN?

115
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,450
>> ABBY, I WISH I HAD A

116
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:19,617
SIMPLE ANSWER BUT A LOT OF

117
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:20,885
IT STARTS WITH THE MOST

118
00:03:20,886 --> 00:03:21,853
IMPORTANT INSTITUTION OF

119
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:22,720
GOVERNMENT WE'LL EVER HAVE.

120
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:24,556
THE HOME.

121
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:25,623
MOTHERS AND FATHERS RAISING

122
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:26,758
THEIR CHILDREN TO RESPECT

123
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,960
OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AS HUMAN

124
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,361
BEINGS TEAMING THEM TO HAVE

125
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:34,132
SOME BASIC FUNDAMENTAL

126
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:37,135
MANNER COURTESAYS

127
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:37,802
MANNER COURTESIES.

128
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,170
EXTENDS ALL THE WAY UP TO

129
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:39,971
NOT ONLY OUR POLITICAL

130
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:40,839
LEADERSHIP BUT THE PEOPLE

131
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,940
WHO ARE MAYBE THE AMPLE

132
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:42,907
FIRES OF PUBLIC OPINION IN

133
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:43,741
THE MEDIA.

134
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:49,113
REALLY CONCERNED THAT THERE

135
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,282
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE

136
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:52,116
ZERO UNDERSTANDING OF

137
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:52,750
AMERICAN HISTORY.

138
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,118
THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT WE

139
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,420
JUST OBSERVED THE FOURTH OF

140
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,821
JULY AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA

141
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,556
WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT.

142
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:00,358
HOW IT STARTED.

143
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,559
WHAT ITS FUNDAMENTAL

144
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,594
PRINCIPLES ARE AND HOW WE

145
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:03,862
SAVE IT.

146
00:04:03,863 --> 00:00:00,000
ED: ALL RIGHT.
