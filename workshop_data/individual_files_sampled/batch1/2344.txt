sleep is just so important so I'd start there that's me as the lowest hanging fruit if you're not getting between seven to nine hours of sleep I'd really make that a priority my name is Brett Dahlberg and I'm co-author of the new book peak performance elevate your game avoid burnout and thrive with the new science of success second to sleep I think that particularly if the work that you do involves your mind not your body exercise is a wonderful tool it allows you to get in touch with the more physical sense of yourself which I think in and of itself is very powerful but there's also lots of research that shows the exercise helps with a lot of the things that are driving people crazy about work so things like anxiety things like willpower those can all be boosted by regular exercise another thing that is very interesting to muse this notion of social ties in what I call social recovery so just hanging out with a group of people that you enjoy spending time with not necessarily talking about work and things that are stressing you out that defeats the purpose but hanging out having a good time has actually been shown to change our biochemistry and give us the same hormone put again promote growth and promote recovery
