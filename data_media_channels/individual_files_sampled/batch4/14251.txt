this is as relevant with rebel dawn media I am at the Royal Courts of Justice in London where the mornings proceedings have just concluded in the appeal of Tommy Robinson what's new today is that it's not just an appeal of a sentence it's an appeal of the conviction and an appeal of his case in Canterbury a year ago and I saw someone in the court from America will Chamberlain a lawyer formerly with the Competitive Enterprise Institute who's been following the Tommy Robinson case so I sort of pressed him in the service as a bit of a legal commentator will great to see you in London that's great to be here with you as er absolutely you know what this is an important case not just for Brits but for Canadians and Americans and I know their supporters have Tommy all around the world before I ask you about what we saw this morning tell me why you think an Americans should care about someone in London named Tommy Robinson I mean I think this is a pretty shocking case that's happened to Tommy all around like nothing that happened to Tommy could have happened in the United States legal system he couldn't have been thrown in jail for reporting on a trial the First Amendment protects reporting and the sort of broad reporting restrictions that were put in place by the this judge would have been totally illegal similarly he couldn't have been thrown in jail for 10 months without a trial American system says anything more than six months requires a jury trial in mitts contempt of court and the summary procedure in this case would also be offensive to the American tort system where he was picked up and thrown in jail on the same day for up to 10 months so I see it as a sense of what's why is the UK like this and what are the differences in American and UK law that allow UK judges to wield so much power yeah those are excellent points and it's it's a good reminder of the importance of the First Amendment one of the things that we heard in some detail from Tommy's barrister Jeremy Dean QC was Tommy's mistreatment in the prison itself how he's in solitary confinement denied the right to let's say go to church how he's only allowed half an hour in the prison yard how he's how his meetings with lawyers have been cancelled or cut short really atrocious conduct I don't see Amnesty International or reporters without borders here would the ACLU take this case and then in the u.s. would would anyone who cares about prisoners rights take this case in the u.s. well I mean two years ago I certainly would have said yes and in the last two years though the ACLU has not shown a solid commitment to freedom of speech if the speaker is not someone they approve of that's it's actually very sad but in general I think one particular point that was very distressing was the fact that they were cutting short his meetings with his lawyers I think you only had to in the end and they were both cut short by more than half right and one of the issues that the judge has pointed out is that the appeal was out of time in the sense that it's it seems pretty clear that they missed at filing deadline for the appeal but the problem was if the court system in the government the prisons were playing games with Tommy and not letting him see his lawyers and it becomes very hard to file that appeal on time in the first place so there's there's some very profound questions about whether justice has even remotely been done so far in this case procedurally I think you're right what came clear to me is just how how hard Tommy's sentence has been solitary confinement to four months I you know the proceedings are not done we've just had a few hours but the sense I'm getting from looking at the judges there's three a three-judge panel I think Dame McGowan one of the judges her intervention seemed critical of Tommy but that doesn't necessarily mean anything the Chief Justice themselves his interventions always seem sympathetic to Tommy I'm gonna go out on a limb and make a prediction because that's what pundits do I think that I don't know if they're gonna overturn the conviction in Canterbury last year I doubt they will they may overturn the conviction in Leeds but I now believe that even if those two things don't happen they'll let Tommy out having served enough time because it's so clear that he's being abusive Lee handled and his sentence is overly long that's my hunch if I had to say something at 12:00 noon here yeah I think that's exactly right I think the problem with the Canterbury appeal is that it really is clearly very late like it's over a year since that suspended sentence was handed down so I don't think the judges are going to disturb that but I think you're right I think they're gonna see the fundamental injustice in the way that tommy was dealt with at the Leeds Crown Court and I think they'll either quash that sentence or substantially reduce it well it's nice to meet you finally I follow you on Twitter and you know you're you're a lawyer from America with an American sensibility of freedom it's great to have a dose of that here in the UK absolutely thanks for having me all right there you have a will Chamberlain of
