00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,400
ROB: NEWLY FREED AMERICAN

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,067
HOSTAGES BACK IN THE UNITED

3
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,770
STATES AFTER MONTHS OF

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,437
IMPRISONMENT IN NORTH KOREA.

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,940
ARRIVING AT WALTER REED MEDICAL

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,675
CENTER AFTER A WARM WELCOME HOME

7
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:29,379
FROM DONALD TRUMP AND THE FIRST

8
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:29,680
LADY.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:39,790
JILLIAN: THE AUTHOR OF NUCLEAR

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,357
SHOWDOWN GORDON CHANG.

11
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:40,991
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

12
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:41,625
YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE WERE

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,192
WATCHING THIS AT 3 AM.

14
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:42,926
>> GREAT DAY WHEN AMERICANS ARE

15
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:43,627
FREED FROM TIERNEY AND THAT

16
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,328
HAPPENED TODAY AND THEY WERE

17
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:46,196
ABLE TO WALK ON THE PLANE UNLIKE

18
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:47,964
OTTO WARMBIER WHO CAME BACK IN A

19
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:53,937
VEGETATIVE STATE SO THIS IS A

20
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:56,106
JOYOUS MOMENT AND A GOOD SIGN

21
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:56,807
FOR NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS BUT

22
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,475
LET'S SAY FOR THE MOMENT BECAUSE

23
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,378
THIS WAS A TERRIFIC DAY.

24
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:04,513
ROB: YOU MENTIONED THE

25
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:05,248
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OTTO WARMBIER

26
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:13,390
AND THESE THREE AND THAT SHOWS A

27
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,091
CHANGE IN THEIR AGENDA, THAT

28
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:14,825
THEY ARE HAPPY AND HEALTHY AND

29
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,225
COMING HOME.

30
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:21,932
>> THE NORTH KOREANS WANTED TO

31
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:22,666
CREATE A GOOD ATMOSPHERE SO THEY

32
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,266
WERE IN GOOD CONDITION.

33
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,368
WITH NORTH KOREA THERE ARE VERY

34
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,936
WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO SAY

35
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:30,073
WITH WE WANT TO HAVE GOOD

36
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:30,640
RELATIONS WITH THE US.

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:39,216
WE ARE ENTERING THESE

38
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:39,950
NEGOTIATIONS, LET'S BE FRIENDS.

39
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,684
JILLIAN: A LOT HAS CHANGED OVER

40
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,351
THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR.

41
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,018
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS

42
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:42,452
COMING SUMMIT?

43
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:45,021
>> WE INSIST ON NORTH KOREANS

44
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:45,722
GIVING UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND

45
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:46,256
BALLISTIC MISSILES.

46
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:49,726
>> DO YOU THINK THEY WILL?

47
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:50,394
>> IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER

48
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:53,797
DONALD TRUMP IS WILLING TO USE

49
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:54,498
ALL THE ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN

50
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:58,668
POWER TO FORCE THE NORTH KOREANS

51
00:01:58,668 --> 00:01:59,403
TO DO SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT

52
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:00,103
TO DO AND THOUGHT THEY WOULD

53
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:00,470
NEVER DO.

54
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,607
IT IS A TRUMP QUESTION, NOT A

55
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:04,040
KIM QUESTION.

56
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,942
WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF WE CAN DO

57
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,244
NOT ONLY TO THE NORTH KOREANS

58
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:12,549
BUT MAJOR POWER BACKERS,

59
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,116
RUSSIANS AND CHINESE.

60
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:13,850
ROB: LOOKING AT THE WORLD FROM

61
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,584
WESTERN PERSPECTIVE, YOU SEE HOW

62
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:19,222
WELL WE ARE ABLE TO LIVE AND HOW

63
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:19,923
THEY LIVE IN NORTH KOREA, YOU

64
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:20,657
WOULD THINK THE IDEA OF OPENING

65
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:24,795
THE COUNTRY AND PLAYING TO BUY

66
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:25,429
INTERNATIONAL RULES WOULD

67
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:30,200
BENEFIT EVERYBODY, WHAT DO THEY

68
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,734
FIND SO THREATENING?

69
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,435
>> IT WOULD BENEFIT THE NORTH

70
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:41,812
KOREAN PEOPLE BUT KIM,

71
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:42,078
>> IT WOULD BENEFIT THE NORTH

72
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:42,345
KOREAN PEOPLE BUT KIM, AN

73
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:43,079
INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED POSITION,

74
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,814
WHEN PEOPLE ARE POOR, THEY DON'T

75
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:44,514
HAVE THE MEANS TO RESIST AND

76
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:45,215
THAT IS WHY THIS REGIME EVEN

77
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:45,816
THOUGH IT IS COMPLETELY

78
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:46,550
DESTITUTE AND HAS BEEN THAT WAY

79
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,555
FOR MANY DECADES HE IS ABLE TO

80
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:52,222
SURVIVE BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK

81
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:52,556
FORWARD.

82
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:53,223
JILLIAN: WE EXPECT TO LEARN

83
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:53,890
INFORMATION FROM THE THREE

84
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,859
AMERICANS BEING CHECKED OUT

85
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:56,226
MEDICALLY.

86
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:59,129
AT SOME POINT WE WILL HEAR

87
00:02:59,129 --> 00:02:59,463
THINGS.

88
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:03,667
WHAT ARE WE LEARNING FROM THEM.

89
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:09,673
>> AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO OTTO

90
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:10,373
WARMBIER, I DON'T THINK THEY

91
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:11,107
WILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN KEPT

92
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:17,380
IN SILOS SO NOT SURE THEY KNOW

93
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,081
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO OTHER

94
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:18,715
DETAINEES BUT ANY BIT OF

95
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:19,449
INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

96
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,183
WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT

97
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:24,588
GOES ON IN NORTH KOREA.

98
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:25,222
IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY

99
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:25,822
IMPORTANT AND COULD BE

100
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:34,464
CONSEQUENTIAL IN CONNECTION WITH

101
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:34,898
OTHER THINGS.

102
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:35,632
>> ANOTHER ONE WE TALKED ABOUT

103
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,233
LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE.

104
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,669
>> HE DISAPPEARED UNDER

105
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:40,403
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ARE REALLY

106
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:41,037
SUSPICIOUS AND THESE ARE

107
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:41,771
INDICATIONS HE IS IN NORTH KOREA

108
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,174
THAT MAKES SENSE FROM A NUMBER

109
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:44,674
OF PERSPECTIVES.

110
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:49,946
CHINESE POLICE REPORTED THIS IS

111
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:50,614
FABRICATED FROM ALL WE KNOW.

112
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:51,348
I THINK THE NORTH KOREANS SHOULD

113
00:03:51,348 --> 00:00:00,000
SAY WE HAVE A MORE WE DON'T.
