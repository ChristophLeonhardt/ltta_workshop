as President Donald Trump bobbed along with Saudi Arabia's King Salman in a traditional sword dance a year ago it was unclear what was being signaled on the campaign trail candidate Trump had pledged to be an outsider and break with the foreign policy establishment embarking on a new course in the Middle East exterminating what he called Islamic extremism establishing peace between the Israelis and Palestinians and bringing US troops home but in hindsight Trump's extravagant stay in Saudi Arabia was a sign of continuity with u.s. Middle Eastern policy as long as billions of dollars of US weaponry were bought and the u.s. is hegemonic aspirations were not threatened Middle Eastern countries could do as they wish no matter the consequences for Middle East peace or the stoking of armed groups unconditional support for some of the worst autocrats in the region of the Israeli occupation and a general disdain for international law and basic principles of human rights again there's nothing terribly new about all of that in terms of US foreign policy but it is so flagrant Iran and ISIL dominate the Trump administration's deliberations gone is the Obama administration's tentative recognition that Iran and the US have common strategic interests I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal but in withdrawing from that deal Donald Trump is simply returning to u.s. foreign policy tradition after all even Hillary Clinton at once called Barack Obama reckless and naive for even considering negotiating with Tehran Trump is built on his predecessors rules of engagement when fighting ISIL surpassing Obama's civilian casualty count in the process and despite his america-first rhetoric Trump is acquiesce to the establishment hardliners around him quietly surging troops to them at least including an apparently open-ended occupation of portions of Syria to counter Iranian influence Jerusalem the capital of Israel thank you peace between the Israelis and Palestinians appears also to have been subordinated to the forging of a u.s. arab-israeli axis against Iran but while Democrat and in administration's have long been protected off the Israeli occupation seemingly indifferent to Israel's killing of Palestinians and focused on selling as many arms as possible to the region these policies are less easy to brush aside now that Trump isn't charged that you're actually seeing some Democrats who are speaking a little more boldly against the kind of policies they had supporter when Democrats were in office a frank discussion about the us's role in the Middle East may finally be beginning she Avril tan see al Jazeera Washington
