1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:03,909
THANKFULLY NO ONE INJURED.

2
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,318
THEIR KIDS.

3
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:14,286
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TAKING

4
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:16,589
AWAY ABOUT 21 U.S. DOLLARS EVERY

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,591
TWO WEEKS FOR EACH CHILD NOT UP

6
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:20,826
TO DATE WITH THEIR REQUIRED

7
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:21,293
VACCINATIONS.

8
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:22,962
BUT HOW SHOULD WE REGULATE

9
00:00:22,963 --> 00:00:24,463
VACCINES IN THE U.S.?

10
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:41,580
MOTHER AND ATTORNEY, THANK YOU

11
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:42,615
FOR BEING HERE.

12
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:44,350
AS A FATHER I HAVE DECIDED TO

13
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:45,351
VACCINATE ON THE BASIC STUFF.

14
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:50,322
I RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT FOR

15
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:51,390
PARENTS TO HAVE THAT RIGHT FOR

16
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,358
THEIR CHILD.

17
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,927
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS

18
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:55,261
POLICY?

19
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:57,229
>> THERE ARE REASONS PARENTS CAN

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,231
OPT-OUT, RELIGIOUS REASONS,

21
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:00,866
MEDICAL REASONS OR PHILOSOPHICAL

22
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:01,200
REASONS.

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,637
AUSTRALIA IS DOING.

24
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:05,638
WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL WE

25
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:08,340
HAVE A LARGE OUTBREAK OF SOME

26
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,909
DEADLY DISEASE LIKE MEASLES OR

27
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,876
SOMETHING THAT COULD AFFECT THE

28
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:11,911
POPULATION AS A WHOLE.

29
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:14,280
I UNDERSTAND THE PARENTS

30
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:17,583
CONCERNS BUT DON'T WANT MY CHILD

31
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:19,151
GOING TO SCHOOL WITH KIDS THAT

32
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:19,718
AREN'T VACCINATED.

33
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,619
I THINK THE UNITED STATES SHOULD

34
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:25,257
>> CARLA, FINES, MAKING IT

35
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:27,626
ILLEGAL IN AUSTRALIA?

36
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:29,328
FAMOUSLY AMERICA IS A PLACE OF

37
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:29,895
FREEDOM, OF CHOICE.

38
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:38,103
I BELIEVE IT IS A DEBATE OVER

39
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:38,671
GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL.

40
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:39,772
I BELIEVE AS A PARENT I HAVE THE

41
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:41,474
RIGHT TO DECIDE TO VACCINATE OR

42
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,343
NOT TO VACCINATE MY CHILDREN.

43
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:46,645
I DECIDED TO VACCINATE MY THREE

44
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:50,483
VACCINE CALLE

45
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:50,516
VACCINE CALL E

46
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:50,633
VACCINE CALL ED

47
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:50,816
VACCINE CALL E

48
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:52,518
VACCINE CALLED

49
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:52,551
VACCINE CALLED GA

50
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:52,585
VACCINE CALLED GARD

51
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:52,618
VACCINE CALLED GARDAS

52
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:52,651
VACCINE CALLED GARDASIL

53
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:53,419
VACCINE CALLED GARDASIL.

54
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,920
I'M THANKFUL I HAVE THE PARENTAL

55
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:56,422
RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THAT.

56
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:57,556
I BELIEVE LIMITED GOVERNMENT IS

57
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:58,190
REALLY BEST.

58
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,558
I THINK WHEN GOVERNMENT PLAYS

59
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,960
THE ROLE OF THE PARENT, THEY

60
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,261
PLAY A TERRIBLE ROLE IN

61
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:02,628
PARENTING.

62
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,196
WE'VE SEEN THAT HISTORICALLY

63
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,901
AND I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

64
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:11,971
THAT.

65
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:14,440
WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

66
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,942
FROM A LOT OF THE OUTBREAKS THAT

67
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:17,843
WE'RE SEEING THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

68
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:18,544
HERE FOR DECADES.

69
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,115
YOU LOOK AT IT FROM SORT OF A

70
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:25,317
PHYSICIAN'S VIEW, HOW IMPORTANT

71
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:26,218
ARE VACCINATIONS, AND DO YOU

72
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,152
HAVE TO MANDATE THEM FOR THEM TO

73
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:28,521
BE EFFECTIVE?

74
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:29,755
>> I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO

75
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:30,222
MANDATE THEM.

76
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:32,324
WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY IS

77
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,994
WE HAVE ABSOLUTE FAILURE OF OUR

78
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,400
RATES DROPPED IMMENSELY,

79
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,902
OUTBREAK OF MEASLES IN

80
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:45,337
CALIFORNIA IN 2015.

81
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,443
THESE BECAUSE PARENTS WERE

82
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:52,711
MAKING DECISIONS THEY WEREN'T

83
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:53,279
PREPARED TO MAKE.

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,747
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TRUST YOUR

85
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:55,915
PHYSICIAN.

86
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,316
CHOOSING YOUR DOCTOR IS A BOND

87
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:57,750
OF TRUST.

88
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,685
IF YOU COME TO ME AND SAY YOU

89
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:03,155
BUT THE VACCINES BECAUSE I DON'T

90
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:04,723
REALLY THINK YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT

91
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:05,958
VACCINES THEN YOU DON'T TRUST ME

92
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:06,926
AS A PHYSICIAN.

93
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,463
A LOT OF IT CAN BE VERY

94
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:12,665
CLINICAL, DIFFERENT PERSON EVERY

95
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,365
TIME.

96
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:15,100
SUDDENLY YOUR BABY IS THERE,

97
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,602
THERE ARE FOUR NEEDLES GOING

98
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:17,603
INTO THEM AND YOU DON'T KNOW

99
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:18,404
WHAT IT IS AND YOU CAN

100
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:18,837
UNDERSTAND --

101
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:20,339
>> THAT'S OUR JOBS AS PHYSICIANS

102
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,376
TO EDUCATE OUR PATIENTS.

103
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,478
HISTORICALLY THE U.S. HAS ALWAYS

104
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,212
FAVORED OVER PUBLIC HEALTH AS

105
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,184
BACK IN 1905, A CASE OF JACOBSON

106
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:34,253
VERSUS MASSACHUSETTS WHERE THE

107
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:40,759
PREVAILS.

108
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,861
>> STATISTICALLY IF YOU LOOK AT

109
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,430
THE STATES AND YOU LOOK AT THE

110
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:45,998
PERCENTAGES, THE LOWEST STATES,

111
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,466
90% ARE VACCINATED, SO THAT

112
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,501
MEANS ONLY 10% ARE NOT

113
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,903
VACCINATED OF OUR CHILDREN.

114
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:53,505
SO 90% ARE PROTECTED.

115
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,374
10% ARE AT RISK.

116
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,142
>> AND WE NEED TO ENFORCE THAT

117
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:58,944
MORE SO THAT THE NUMBER DOESN'T

118
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:00,346
DROP BECAUSE LIKE THE DOCTOR

119
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:02,247
SAYS, THERE'S ALL THESE, YOU

120
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,682
KNOW, OUTBREAKS OF DISEASES SUCH

121
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,517
AS MEASLES AND WE DON'T WANT

122
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:09,788
INNOCENT CHILDREN TO BE

123
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:10,656
AFFECTED.

124
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:11,924
PETE: OUR HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION

125
00:04:11,925 --> 00:00:00,000
SYSTEM, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
