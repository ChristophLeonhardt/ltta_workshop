I'm looking forward to it actually you want to have a deal there's been no collusion whatsoever there's no obstruction whatsoever and I'm looking forward to it the day Donald Trump talks to special counsel robert muller may be drawing closer but if team trump has its way that day might come with some strings attached sources familiar with the matter tell The Wall Street Journal that trumps lawyers may try to make a deal with Muller commit to a deadline to wrap up the parts of the Russia probe that relate to Trump in exchange for a sit-down interview with the president they may also ask Muller to limit the scope of his questioning Trump's attorney calls the journal story totally false Paul Butler's back with me and joining me now criminal defense attorneys Seema Iyer and former Watergate prosecutor Nick Ackerman Nick I'll ask you what is such a deal ever fly there's no way a prosecutor would ever agree to say okay you come in and ten days later we're going to drop this whole thing yeah that's not going to happen the way this works is evidence comes out as the investigation continues yeah most significantly you've got man afford under indictment in two cases where they're hoping to get them a good 15 20 year sentence and then force them to testify so nothing's going to happen any too soon yeah and you know you've been making the request happen right no it's not going to happen but everybody has to understand what are they supposed to do Trump's team has to delay the interview of Trump and put as many obstacles in the path that are legally justifiable and this being one of them at least make the motion and the reason they've got to be afraid Paul is that Donald Trump is in a sticky situation for so he's known to lie yeah he's alone cereal air but he also apparently has said some things that they could ask other people about they could put him in jeopardy of potential obstruction the New York Times reporting that mr. Porter Rob Porter who was recently let go because he was a beating is from wives told Don McGann who is the what our McGann who is the White House Counsel that the president wanted him to release a statement saying that the story that Maga was asked to fire Muller was not true mr. Porter who resigned last month minute domestic abuse scandal told mr. McGann that the president had suggested that he might get rid of him again if he chose not to challenge the article so problems yeah so not only would mother not agree to a meeting with the president under those terms the president's lawyers would never let him go in because he would be walking into a path of self-destruction among other things he could be asked about why did you try to shave the testimony of the White House Counsel why did you try to create a floss nearer to about what happened so if you look technically that's not witness intimidation yeah what it is is more evidence of obstruction of justice yeah and witness tampering is an extremely serious crime it carries 15 years in prison but you don't think we're there yeah we're not at Witness let me see let's see okay here here I'm gonna give this once you seemeth this is also coordinator times according to your time the president had said that he never ordered on McGann to fire the special counsel but mr. McGann replied to trump that he was wrong and that he had in fact asked mr. McKenna in June to call the Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen stein and tell him the special counsel at a series of conflicts that disqualified him from overseeing the investigation and that he had to be dismissed so McGann told the Trump told again that he didn't remember the discussion that way so if McGann is admitting and it's out in the New York Times that Trump was trying to get him to make up a fake story right and trying to pressure him to fire the special counsel are we not at least what looks to us like obstruction we are close to consciousness of guilt maybe or witness tampering funny the catch-all Savior phrases I don't recall so if you have McGann saying oh he ordered me to do this yeah you have Trump saying I don't recall yeah then we're not at least at either witness tampering yet let me just say I don't recall as a word that was used throughout Watergate it was least a half a dozen people who were convicted of gantry based on the phrase okay I want to prevent this meeting that's what they want for the meeting right he there's no one situation all right let's talk about collusion let's go back to collusion your favorite thank you all right we're gonna go to Sam your favorite quote our favorite thing that we talk about because we think it's it's getting closer to it we want to see if you agree okay the idea of collusion Sam done Berg who's known ultra of a really long time he's one of the longest-serving Trump aids he was fired from the campaign and now is talking all kinds of talking business number with Julia border of CNN talking about what investigators now he's been out to talk to the investigators and what they think about collusion take a listen they think that Roger colluded with Julian Assange I can tell you Roger did not collude with Julian Assange so they think and why do you believe they think he colluded with Julian Assange because he was communicating sorry Gloria I met Laura in Porter okay so I watched that now here's the deal if Roger stone was colluding with Julian Assange and interfere in the election that's one issue but there still needs to be the dot that is connected between Donald Trump knowing having that corrupt intent right and also being connected to Julian Assange who interfered in the election process we know the Russians interfere in the election process right we know WikiLeaks did but Roger stone has still we know that Roger stones boy we know that Roger stone is president Trump's boy that's other question was involved in the strategic released of the emails stone is talking to WikiLeaks about the emails I mean protect him that's the thing that people understand if they're both pretending that they're not friends with each other and then he was fired to get this together then Roger stone would protect don't they be charged wouldn't be purging himself right crime is a conspiracy to violate the federal hacking statute the object of which was to get Donald Trump elected president by using the emails from the DNC the quid pro quo was the dropping of Russian sanctions so the question is did Donald Trump join that conspiracy right did Roger stone join it when he had conversations with people from WikiLeaks yeah and from gusoff or 2.0 but also did Donald Trump was he aware that people in his campaign were willing to trade dirt on Hillary Clinton right we try to be considered material better they can't be no right here is Sam number again and this is on CNN on whether Donald Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting his son and son-in-law participate even do you think that Donald Trump says that President Trump says he knew nothing about the meeting do you do you think that that's true well you don't think that's true no you know it's not true even he talked about it for a week before and I don't know why he's business all he had to say was yeah we met with the Russians the Russians offered us something and we thought they had something and that was good I don't know why he went around trying to hide it's a problem but my point is that everybody is being very smart to protect Donald Trump from being connected to the evidence and that's what it looks like is happening now whether it's Roger stone or dong connects himself to the evidence you know you don't try to protect innocent people there would be an indictment now if he was connected there would be no I think Muller is still putting this together you have Trump saying on June 7th after the New Jersey primary that he was going to release all his dirt really following would you really say that by the way Roger stone Roger stone responded to sam nunn Berg TV interviews he put up a Facebook post in which he said I did confirm through a source that WikiLeaks really had material on Hillary and would publish it after Assange said it so an interview it will be an incredible set of coincidences if Roger stone who arranged Donald Trump's full screen a full-page ad in 1987 saying he should take over negotiations with Russia on nukes right the guy who who is partners with manna Ford who says he had foreknowledge that WikiLeaks was going to dump dirt on Trump Trump says Russia if you're listening dump this dirt and I'm gonna make it announcer who drew the camp 145 Trump sends 145 weeks and gusoff for 2.0 that's when all this comes out it all comes out in that first not that June time period between June 4th when they first learned about bringing the dirt to Trump Tower June 9th meeting and then right through to old mid June when these emails start to be okay lightning round wasn't there well okay lightning round we're gonna have everybody put on the prosecutor had now who would be the next person that you would indict in order to get to the truth okay Don jr. Kushner he's got the keys to the castle sorry Jared Papa hired Nick Ackerman this is one of my favorite panels I love having these guys on thank you guys so much and coming up in our next hour Marianne hammer the hammer is defeated in Florida and the latest on Trump's trade war more a.m. drive for the break hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
