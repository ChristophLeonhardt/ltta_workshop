>> THESE TARIFFS ARE TOTALLY

6
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:11,394
UNACCEPTABLE.

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,966
IMPLEMENT NEW TARIFFS ON STEEL

9
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:17,234
AND IMPORTS FROM CANADA, MEXICO,

10
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,869
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD FAN

11
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,005
THE WINDS OF A GLOBAL TRADE WAR

12
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:25,408
OR SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT

13
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:27,577
THE DAYS OF MASSIVE U.S. TRADE

14
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,179
BALANCE IS AN UNFAIR AND

15
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,046
ACCURATE SOMATIC MARKET ACCESS

16
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:30,413

ARGUMENTS ON LOGIC AND COMMON

19
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,319
SENSE AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL

20
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,255
PREVAIL AGAINST AN

21
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:39,823
ADMINISTRATION THAT DOES NOT

22
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:42,325
ALWAYS ALIGN ITSELF AROUND THOSE

23
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:42,726
PRINCIPLES.

24
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,228
>> IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE

25
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:47,764
THAT THE COUNTRY IS IMPOSING

26
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:48,698
THESE MATTERS.

27
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,433
>> GLOBAL TRADE IS NOT A

28
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,568
GUNFIGHT AT O.K. CORRAL.

29
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,937

>> HE HAS WORKED TO EXEMPT

39
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,187
CERTAIN ALLIES FOR WHICH WE HAVE

40
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:10,720
TRADING OR SECURITY

41

RELATIONSHIPS.

42
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:12,889
BUT IN THESE INSTANCES, IT WAS

43
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:13,957
NOT POSSIBLE.

44
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:15,992
SO THE PRESIDENT TOOK ACTION.

45
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,461
>> IN RETALIATION MEXICO SAID IT

46
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,396
WOULD TARGET THE U.S.

47
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:23,333
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.

48
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,402
AND CANADA ANNOUNCED A

49
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:26,970

PARTY QUESTION THE WISDOM OF THE

53
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:32,976
POLICY, TENNESSEE SENATOR LAMAR

54
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:35,579
SAYING THAT THIS IS A BIG

55
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,880
MISTAKE, CALLING TARIFFS

56
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,415
BASICALLY HIGHER TAXES ON

57
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:38,949
AMERICAN CONSUMERS.

58
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,483
THE BEN SASSE OF NEBRASKA ADDING

59
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:41,651
THAT THIS IS DUMB.

60
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,053
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

61
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:46,656
SHOULD NOT MEAN MAKE AMERICA

62
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:47,057
1929 AGAIN.

63
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:48,792
BOTH MEN ARGUED WHEN IT COMES TO

64
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,560
TARIFFS, THE U.S. SHOULD HIT

65
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,530
CHINA, NOT AL OUR ALLIES.

66
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,765
OBER ROSS SAID THAT HE WAS NOT

67
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:56,566
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROW.

68
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,468
>> THIS HAS BEEN UNDER

69
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,971
DISCUSSION FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

70
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:03,640
AND IT IS A VERY SMALL

71
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,142
PERCENTAGE OF THE RESPECTED

72
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:06,476
ECONOMY.

73
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,511
A FRACTION OF 1%.

74
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:11,381
>> CHINESE LEADERS SEE THE

75
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,349
ANTICIPATING TARIFFS SOON,

76
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,750

HAPPEN.

78
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,720
