>> Sandra: JOHN ROBERTS IS
LIVE WITH MORE.
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
THE PRESIDENT LOOKS LIKE HE IS
GOING TO BE GOING TO FLORIDA,
GEORGIA ON MONDAY.
DEPENDING ON HOW THE RECOVERY
EFFORTS GO.
THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING
PROMISING THAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT IS IN POSITION AND IS
READY TO RESPOND VERY QUICKLY.
LISTEN HERE.
>> WELL, IT IS GOING TO GO FAST.
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT GO FAST.
WE ARE FOLLOWING AN END.
IT IS JUST ABOUT GONE FROM
CERTAIN AREAS.
ONE THING WE HAD TO OUR
ADVANTAGE WAS THE SPEED.
THIS THING WAS IN AND OUT, BUT
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN POWER LIKE
THAT.
>> THE PRESIDENT TAKING SOME
HEAT FOR GOING TO A POLITICAL
RALLY LAST NIGHT EVEN AS THE
HURRICANE WAS STILL RAGING.
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DID NOT
WANT TO DISAPPOINT PEOPLE WHO
HAD BEEN LINING UP ALL DAY.
THE DEMOCRATS MAKING A LOT OF
POLITICAL HAY ABOUT IT.
>> Sandra: WHAT ELSE IS ON THE
AGENDA AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY?
>> A LOT OF MUSICIANS AND
MUSICAL ICONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE
WERE NOW FOR DECIDING THE
MUSICAL MODERNIZATION ACT.
THEN AFTER THAT, WHAT
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT.
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE
HAVING LUNCH WITH CONNIE WEST.
LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT
SAID A LITTLE WHILE AGO ABOUT
THAT.
>> FIRST OF ALL, I LIKE HIM A

WHEN HE CAME OUT VERY STRONGLY A
NUMBER OF MONTHS AGO, SOMETHING

MY POLLS WENT UP LIKE 20%.

THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.
A BIG, BIG FOLLOWING.
AND I THINK HE DOES IN A LOT OF
COMMUNITIES.
>> Jon: ALL OF THE
PHOTOGRAPHERS AND CAMERAS LINED
UP, HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF
KANYE.
ALSO WEIGHING IN ON THE STOCK
MARKET YESTERDAY.
THE PRESIDENT, THE WHITE HOUSE
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE
IS BULL MARKET CORRECTIONS GOING
ON HERE.
A LITTLE BIT OF VOLATILITY.
THE PRESIDENT DOES SAY THAT
INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS

ANOTHER ONE EXPECTED BEFORE THE
END OF THE YEAR.
THE PRESIDENT WITH SOME HARSH
WORDS YESTERDAY IN PENNSYLVANIA
FOR THE FED.
>> I THINK THE FED IS MAKING A
MISTAKE.
THEY ARE SO TIGHT.
I THINK THE FED HAS GONE CRAZY.
SO YOU COULD SAY THAT THAT'S A
LOT OF SAFETY, ACTUALLY.
AND IT IS.
IT GIVES YOU A LOT OF MARGINS,
BUT I THINK THE FED HAS GONE
CRAZY.
>> Jon: THE PRESIDENT DOES
BELIEVE IN AN INDEPENDENT
FEDERAL RESERVE, BUT TO MY
KNOWLEDGE, THAT IS THE FIRST
TIME A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES HAS EVER SAID THE
WORDS "THE FED HAS GONE CRAZY."
>> Sandra: THEY HAVE RAISED
INTEREST RATES THREE TIMES THIS
YEAR.
EXPECTED TO HIKE ONCE MORE BY
THE END OF THE YEAR.
