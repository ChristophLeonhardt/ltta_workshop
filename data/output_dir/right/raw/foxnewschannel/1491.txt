00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,310
>> President Trump: PRISON

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,646
REFORM IS AN ISSUE THAT UNITES

3
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,880
PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,681
POLITICAL SPECTRUM.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,082
AN AMAZING THING.

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,984
OUR WHOLE NATION BENEFITS.

7
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:21,288
IF FORMER INMATES ARE ABLE TO

8
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,722
RE-ENTER SOCIETY AS PRODUCTIVE

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,623
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.

10
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,524
>> Laura: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

11
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,192
SEEKING COMMON GROUND ON AN

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,628
ISSUE LONG CHAMPIONED BY THE

13
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,030
LEFT BUT MANY DEMOCRATS

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,299
OBJECTED TO A PRISON REFORM

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,566
BILL THE HOUSE JUST PASSED.

16
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,435
HERE TO TELL US WHY IS

17
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,203
CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLINS FROM

18
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,340
GEORGIA WHO CON SPONSORED THE

19
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,275
FIRST STEP -- CO-SPONSORED THE

20
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:42,842
FIRST STEP ACT.

21
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,077
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE LATE.

22
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,646
YOU DO SOMETHING WITH HAKEEM

23
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,648
JEFFRIES, ISN'T HE PUSHING

24
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,582
IMPEACHMENT OF TRUMP?

25
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,283
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

26
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,484
IT ALL CONFUSES ME.

27
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,019
THAT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT

28
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,187
MORE OF, BIPARTISAN WORK.

29
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,588
AND YET THE DEMOCRATS ARE KIND

30
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,090
OF ALL TORN UP ABOUT THIS.

31
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,259
EXCEPT HAKEEM AND OTHERS.

32
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,493
>> I THINK WHAT YOU FIND HERE

33
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,395
WHEN YOU GET A PRESIDENT WHO

34
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,063
IS WILLING TO WORK ON ISSUES

35
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,397
AND WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

36
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,666
WORKING CLASS AND CONCERNED

37
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,934
ABOUT EVERYBODY IN AMERICA,

38
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,269
PUTTING US FIRST.

39
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,470
YOU REACH OUT AND MY PARTNER

40
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,705
ON THIS, WE UNDERSTAND THAT

41
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:12,772
YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A

42
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,474
DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.

43
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,275
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE ARE

44
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,276
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT?

45
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,344
MAKING DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S

46
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,212
LIVES AND GIVING HOPE TO THOSE

47
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:19,746
IN CELLS NOW.

48
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,447
THESE THINGS.

49
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,247
WHEN YOU VOTE AGAINST THE

50
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,682
BILL, IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT AND

51
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,850
YOU VOTED AGAINST THE BILL YOU

52
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,652
VOTED TO KEEP THE LADIES

53
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,619
SHACKLED GIVING BIRTH IN

54
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,454
PRISON.

55
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,991
YOU VOTED TO NOT LET, OR THOSE

56
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,225
WHO NEED HELP WHEN THEY COME

57
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,860
BACK OUT, OVER 90% OF THE

58
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,395
FOLKS COME BACK OUT OF PRISON,

59
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,730
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE

60
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,198
DOING A GOOD JOB SPENDING

61
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,799
FEDERAL DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE

62
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,201
WE PUT THOSE AWAY THAT NEED TO

63
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,502
BE LOCKED AWAY LIKE MS-13.

64
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,070
THEY NEED TO BE LOCKED AWAY

65
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,971
FOREVER OR PUT AWAY.

66
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,606
WE NEED TO TAKE THOSE COMING

67
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,607
BACK OUT TO SOCIETY TO GIVE

68
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,441
THEM TOOLS LIKE THE PRESIDENT

69
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,943
SAID TO BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS

70
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,411
WHEN THEY COME BACK OUT.

71
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,278
>> Laura: SECOND CHANCE AT

72
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,749
REDEMPTION IS A POWERFUL

73
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,350
NARRATIVE IN THE LITERATURE

74
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,952
AND THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY.

75
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,355
GIVE MONEY TO NEW FUNDING FOR

76
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,623
PRISON REENTRY PROGRAMS AND WE

77
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,559
SPEND MONEY ON RECIDIVISM SO

78
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,994
YOU SAVE MONEY IF IT WORKS BUT

79
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,631
IT IS DIVIDING THE DEMOCRATIC

80
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,165
PARTY.

81
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,134
KAMALA HARRIS AGAINST IT, CORY

82
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:14,701
BOOKER AGAINST IT.

83
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,802
THEY ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT

84
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,037
AND THEY WANT TO SHORE UP THE

85
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,238
LEFT WING EVEN THOUGH THE LEFT

86
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:18,905
WAS FOR THIS.

87
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,307
VAN JONES SAID THIS ON CNN

88
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:21,641
TODAY.

89
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,910
LET'S WATCH.

90
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,445
>> IF YOU HOLD OUT FOR

91
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,313
EVERYTHING, SOMETIMES YOU GET

92
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:27,680
NOTHING.

93
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,249
NOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

94
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,350
WE HELD OUT FOR EVERYTHING AND

95
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,618
WE WOUND UP WITH NOTHING.

96
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,186
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY,

97
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,854
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO LEARN

98
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,757
ABOUT THIS COUNTRY IS THAT

99
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,059
WHERE WE DISAGREE, WE ARE

100
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,326
SUPPOSED TO FIGHT AND FIGHT

101
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:40,693
HARD.

102
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,928
BUT DON'T FORGET WHERE WE

103
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,696
AGREE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK

104
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,531
TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER

105
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,498
HARD, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE

106
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,866
WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE.

107
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,134
>> Laura: WELL, HE WAS

108
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,569
SUPPORTING, AT THE EVENT,

109
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,438
SUPPORTING THE PRISON REFORM

110
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:51,771
BILL.

111
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,106
HE IS BEING TRASHED.

112
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,974
A TWEET TODAY, OLIVER WILLIS

113
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:55,842
ON VAN JONES.

114
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,744
VAN PROVIDES WINDOW DRESSING

115
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,678
SO RACIST ADMINISTRATION CAN

116
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,979
POINT TO THEIR BLACK FRIEND

117
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,015
WITHOUT REALLY DOING ANYTHING.

118
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,650
>> IT'S AMAZING.

119
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,285
WHAT HAS BECOME OF MANY OF

120
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,054
THESE ATTACKS ON THIS AND

121
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,489
ATTACKS ON VAN LIKE THAT,

122
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,457
TALLRANCE IS AGREE WITH ME.

123
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,058
WHAT WE HAVE BECOME IS WHEN WE

124
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,193
ACTUALLY EXPRESS VIEWS LIKE

125
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,894
YOU SAID, YOU FIGHT FOR THINGS

126
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,595
YOU BELIEVE IN.

127
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,263
YOU FIND AREAS OF AGREEMENT.

128
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,531
WHEN YOU HAVE A GROUP RIGHT

129
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,200
NOW THE LEFT SAYING WE WANT

130
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,401
MORE AND WE WANT MORE, THEY

131
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,269
HAVE SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO

132
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,170
WE LIKE THE ISSUE.

133
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,672
WE LIKE THE FACT WE'LL BE ON

134
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,774
THIS ISSUE AND NOT HELP

135
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:28,208
ANYBODY.

136
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,709
>> Laura: THEY ARE WORRIED

137
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,112
ABOUT THE BLACK VOTE TURNING

138
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,813
EVEN 5% MORE FOR THE

139
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,247
REPUBLICANS.

140
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,281
GIVING THEM A CHANCE.

141
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,182
MAYBE LISTENING TO THEM.

142
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,251
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.

143
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,352
CONGRESSMAN, I'M GLAD YOU ARE

144
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,453
DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

145
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,387
KEEP DOING MORE OF IT.

146
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,922
THIS IS YOUR THIRD TERM IN

147
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:43,289
CONGRESS.

148
00:03:43,289 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WANT TO BE HERE MUCH
