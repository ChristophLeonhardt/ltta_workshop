1
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:07,904
>> Tucker: HAVING CONVINCED

2
00:00:07,904 --> 00:00:11,707
POOR JEFF LIKE TO WEEKLONG

3
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:12,441
INVESTIGATION, JUDGE KAVANAUGH

4
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:14,310
SOMEBODY SCRUBBED IT IN AN

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,645
ELEVATOR WHICH IS HOW DEMOCRACY

6
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:16,879
WORKS NOW.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,580
DEMOCRATS ARE NOT TRYING TO

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,348
DICTATE THE SCOPE OF THE

9
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:21,684
INVESTIGATION AS IF THEY ARE IN

10
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:22,652
CHARGE OF CONGRESS WHICH THINGS

11
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:24,687
TO JEFF FLAKE THEY ARE.

12
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:26,088
IN A LETTER RELEASED TODAY,

13
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:28,090
DEMOCRATS HAVE CALLED TO THE

14
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,526
BUREAU TO INVESTIGATE ALL THREE

15
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:32,929
A LA ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRETT

16
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:35,198
KAVANAUGH INCLUDING JULIE'S

17
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:38,100
FANTASY ABOUT GANG RAPED.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,736
AT A BARE MINIMUM ABOUT THEIR

19
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:41,737
ALLEGATIONS, NOT QUITE AS

20
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:42,138
IMPRESSIVE.

21
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:43,773
HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW.

22
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:45,174
PROFESSOR, THANK YOU FOR COMING

23
00:00:45,174 --> 00:00:45,441
ON.

24
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:49,946
ARE WE RIGHT TO BE A LITTLE BIT

25
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:50,713
MISLED WHEN DEMOCRATS AND PUBLIC

26
00:00:50,713 --> 00:00:54,284
TOLD US ON FRIDAY, THREE DAYS

27
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:57,554
LATER, THAT THEY WANT CHRISTINE

28
00:00:57,554 --> 00:00:58,755
FORD'S ALLEGATIONS INVESTIGATED

29
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,891
FOR A WEEK AND NOW THE GOALPOSTS

30
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:02,759
ARE SO FAR DOWN THE FIELD WE

31
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,893
CAN'T SEE THEM.

32
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:05,260
SHOULD WE POKE WE HAVE BEEN LIED

33
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,528
TO?

34
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:07,397
>> I THINK THE LEAST CONVINCING

35
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:10,300
PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC CASE IS

36
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,900
THAT THIS WAS NOT BEING

37
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,502
MANIPULATED IN TERMS OF ITS

38
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:12,835
TIMING.

39
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:16,806
I THINK MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT

40
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:17,907
THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE HELD TO

41
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:18,841
THE LAST MINUTES.

42
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,944
RIGHT BEFORE THE VOTE.

43
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:22,545
I THINK THERE IS A LEGITIMATE

44
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:23,079
CRITICISM FOR THAT.

45
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,515
ALSO I THINK YOU WANT TO

46
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:27,183
ANTICIPATE THAT ONE WEEK IS NOT

47
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:28,918
GOING TO STRATIFY MANY OF THE

48
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:29,519
CRITICS.

49
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,788
THE FACT IS THAT MOST OF THESE

50
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:33,523
STATEMENTS, NOT ALL OF THEM WERE

51
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:34,424
PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO THE

52
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:35,325
COMMITTEE.

53
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,826
THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO CHANGE AND

54
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:38,895
SO THE OUTCOME OF THIS

55
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:39,596
INVESTIGATION IS UNLIKELY TO

56
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:40,330
CHANGE MANY MINDS.

57
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,264
WE ARE GOING TO GET TO A POINT

58
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:43,500
WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE A

59
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,867
DECISION.

60
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,369
IF SENATORS FILL AT THE RECORD

61
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:47,504
IS INSUFFICIENT THEY HAVE A

62
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:48,638
REASON I SUPPOSED TO VOTE ON

63
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:49,906
THAT BASIS.

64
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:53,710
TO KEEP THIS OPEN INDEFINITELY,

65
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,046
IT IS GOING TO DO AN INJUSTICE

66
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:56,880
TO THE NOMINEE AND TO THE

67
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,514
PROCESS.

68
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,149
WE HAVE TO COME TO SOME

69
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,651
CONCLUSION.

70
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,420
>> Tucker: JULIE SPUTNIK'S

71
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,154
CLAIMS THAT THEY WERE A SERIES

72
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:10,126
OF AT LEAST TEN GANG RAPE'S THAT

73
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:12,095
TOOK PLACE, NOBODY'S EVER HEARD

74
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:13,330
THIS AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN

75
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:13,897
ALLEGED.

76
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:16,099
DO YOU THINK THIS RISES TO THE

77
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,701
LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY THAT WOULD

78
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,769
SPUR AN FBI INVESTIGATION ALMOST

79
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:20,236
40 YEARS LATER?

80
00:02:20,236 --> 00:02:22,906
>> SUMS UP THE FBI IS NOT GOING

81
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:24,474
TO INVESTIGATE THAT ALLEGATION.

82
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:26,476
PART OF THE CONCERN FOR MANY

83
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:27,143
PEOPLE IS THAT THIS IS AN

84
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:29,946
EXTRAORDINARY ALLEGATION WITH NO

85
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:31,915
ONE GOING TO THE POLICE.

86
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:32,682
PREVIOUSLY OR ANY ACCOUNTS BEING

87
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:35,518
PUBLISHED AS TO WHAT OCCURRED.

88
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:40,724
FOR THAT REASON I THINK THE FBI

89
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:41,892
IS FOCUSING ON THE EARLIER TWO

90
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:42,292
ALLEGATIONS.

91
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:46,096
>> Tucker: DO YOU EXPECT THAT

92
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,899
REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO

93
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:49,399
REASSERT CONTROL?

94
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,901
>> Martha: I THINK THEY DO RUN

95
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,469
THE SENATE.

96
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:54,271
IF IN ENOUGH TIME, MARK JUDGE

97
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,005
HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED AGAIN UNDER

98
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,106
OATH.

99
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:56,507
WE ARE DONE.

100
00:02:56,507 --> 00:02:57,708
CAN THEY DO THAT?

101
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,077
>> OF COURSE THAT CAN AND IT

102
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:00,777
DOES APPEAR THAT McCONNELL WAS

103
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:01,945
GOING TO PUSH THIS THROUGH.

104
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,714
HE SAID THERE'S GOING TO BE A

105
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:04,248
VOTE OF THIS WEEK.

106
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:05,749
THE TIMING IS A LITTLE BIT

107
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:07,117
CURIOUS BECAUSE THE FBI WAS

108
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:09,987
GIVEN A FULL WEEK THAT WOULD END

109
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:10,854
ON FRIDAY PRESUMABLY A LOT OF

110
00:03:10,854 --> 00:03:12,155
MATERIAL WOULD BE GIVEN TO THE

111
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:13,357
SENATE ON FRIDAY.

112
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:15,325
IT IS NOT QUITE CLEAR HOW THE

113
00:03:15,325 --> 00:00:00,000
LOGISTICS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN
