WELCOME BACK TO OUR SPECIAL BROADCAST OF INSIDE TISSUES FOR THE INSIDE THE ISSUES FOR THE HOUR. THE CAMPAIGN TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA CONTINUES TO GAIN MOMENTUM NOT JUST THIS COUNTRY BUT AROUND THE WORLD. CANADA JUST LEGALIZED IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNALED HIS WILLINGNESS TO END THE FEDERAL BAN ON MARIJUANA. MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT IS GREAT. FORMER CONGRESSMAN PATRICK KENNEDY FEELS UNEASY ABOUT IT. HE WROTE A PIECE IN THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" WARNING LEGALIZING MARIJUANA COULD BE BAD FOR KIDS AND HE WOULD SET BACK THE CAUSE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. WE SPOKE TO HIM EARLIER ABOUT THIS. SO AM INTERESTING TO HEARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE, ONE OF THE ONLY DEMOCRATS TO SAY ANYTHING LIKE THIS OUT LOUD. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR REASONING IS. WE HAVE BEEN WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CURRENT OPIOID CRISIS AND EVERYBODY IS POINTING BACK TO WHERE THEY MARKETED THE ADDICTIVE OXYCONTIN. WHAT WAS ENDING UP HAPPENING IS PUBLIC HEALTH GOT PUT TO THE SIDELINES WHILEM PROFITS FOR PURDUE PHARMA RULED THE PUBLIC HEALTH. WE GO BACK A GENERATION TO THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY SETTLEMENT AND HOW WE HAD TO LEARN FOR A LONG TIME TO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS AN APICKTIVE SUBSTANCE ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE IN NICOTINE MARKETING THE COMMERCIAL MARKETING OF THE CIGARETTES. SO WITH ALL OF THAT KNOWLEDGE WHY WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE IS A NEW COMMERCIAL PUSH, TO PUSH A PRODUCT OUT CALLED MARIJUANA THERE THERE WOULDN'T BE A DELETERIOUS IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH? ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT LEGALIZATION MEANS COMMERCIALIZATION. WHICH REALLY MEANS Tucker: WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND, CONGRESSMAN. WE KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE MARIJUANA COMPANIES ARE COOL, PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT IN THIS FOR THE MONEY. THEY ARE IN IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. WHY DON'T YOU TRUST THEM? WELL, THAT IS THE THING WE HAVE TO ASK OF OURSELVES. ARE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOW GOING INTO INVESTING INTO CANNABIS AND IN THE MANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING PRODUCED? I MIGHT ADD ELIXIRS THE PHANTOM GRAPE AID AND ORANGE AID THAT WE GREW UP WITH INFUSED WITH THE MARIJUANA INFUSED T.H.C. BEYOND JUST THE BROWNIES, THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS NOW INFUSING GUMMY BEARS. THEY ARE INFUSING THINGS LIKE POT-TARTS. OTHER FOOD EDIBLES IS WHAT THEY ARE KNOWN. IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS A REALLY SLICK, VERY SMART MARKETING EFFORT IF YOU HAVE MONEY ON THE LINE BEHIND THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY. YOU ARE STANDING TO GAIN A LOT OF MONEY IN THE YEARS AHEAD. AND YET, WHO IS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST ONE TO PAY FOR ALL OF THIS? IT WILL BE THE PUBLIC HEALTH THAT PAYS THE COST OF THIS. IT WILL BE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO THINK THAT THIS IS AN EASY ALTERNATIVE FOR ME TO DEAL WITH MY STRESS AND ANXIETY BECAUSE NOW I HAVE ALL THE CHOICES. I CAN DRINK IT, I CAN SMOKE IT, I CAN EAT IT. WHATEVER WILL HELP ME PEOPLE LESS ANXIOUS. AND FRANKLY, TUCKER, AMIDST THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE ADDICTION CRISIS IT'S SHOCKING WE ARE NOT ASKING A MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, WHAT ARE WE DOING TO HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR STRESS, COPE WITH THEIR PROBLEMS, NAVIGATE THEIR ANXIETYS? Tucker: THAT IS RIGHT. THAT SHOULD BE THE CHALLENGE ON THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. YET, I THINK WE ARE SELLING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DOWN THE RIVER BY ALLOWING A NEW PREDATORY BUSINESS THAT FEEDS OFF OF ADDICTION, THAT MAKES MONEY OFF OF GETTING PEOPLE HOOKED. I THINK IT'S BAD FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF THIS COUNTRY. I AGREE WITH YOU 100%. BY THE WAY, I SHOULD NOTE FOR THE VIEWERS WHO DON'T KNOW YOU PERSONALLY OVERCAME ADDICTION TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL WITHOUT THE USE OF MORE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND YOU ARE A BETTER
