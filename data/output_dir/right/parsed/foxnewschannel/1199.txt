>> Neil: NANCY PELOSI IS
POO-POOED THE LATEST NUMBER.
THE HEADLINES COULDN'T FIND
ENOUGH WORDS TO PRAISE IT.
IT'S DOING TOO LITTLE TO THE
FAMILIES HIT WITH SOARING NEW
COSTS UNDER THE REPUBLICAN'S
WATCH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
>> I THINK IT'S JUST ABSURD.
THE DEMOCRATS, NANCY'S REACHING
THERE.
THE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE THEIR
TALKING POINTS.
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE.
SO THEY PIVOT OFF TO IDENTITY
POLITICS, NEGATIVE STUFF.
THEY DON'T HAVE A ECONOMIC PLAN.
THEY NEVER HAVE.
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT CAUSES
ECONOMIC GROWTH.
>> Neil: NOT A FOX NEWS ALERT TO
SAYING THE BLUE WAVE MIGHT NOT
BE THE WAVE THAT DEMOCRATS
ENVISIONED OR THEY HAVE A REMOTE
CHANCE OF TAKING OVER THE HOUSE
LET ALONE OF GAINING IN THE
SENATE.
NEITHER WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE THE
ECONOMY IS ON FIRE AND WE MIGHT
THE COUNTRY INCLUDING
CALIFORNIA.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND PETER
DOOCY WITH THE LATEST.
HEY, PETER.
>> NEIL, ALL THAT A CANDIDATE
HAS TO DO IS TO ADVANCE OUT IS
FINISH FIRST OR SECOND PLACE IN
THEIR DISTRICT REGARDLESS OF
THEIR POLITICAL PARTY.
THERE ARE SO MANY DEMOCRATS
RUNNING IN SOME OF THESE
DISTRICTS THAT THEIR SUPPORT MAY
BE WATERED DOWN AND THE
REPUBLICANS MAY GET THE TOP TWO
SPOTS.
SO ONE DEMOCRAT NOW TRYING TO
CONSOLIDATE SUPPORT IS HARLEY
RUDA.
>> OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO
COMMUNICATE TO THE VOTER WHY WE
ARE THE BEST CHOICE, KNOCKING ON
DOORS, PHONE BANKING, DOING THE
THINGS THAT SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS
DO.
IF WE DO IT AND OFTEN, WE'LL BE
ONE OF THOSE TWO CANDIDATES THAT
MOVES FORWARD TO THE GENERAL.
>> IF HE DOESN'T FINISH IN THE
TOP TWO, SCOTT BAUGH MAY BE THE
SECOND REPUBLICAN ON THE BALL
LOT, WHICH WOULD REALLY HURT
NANCY PELOSI'S PLAN TO FLIP THE
HOUSE.
>> THE MORE SEATS YOU TAKE OFF
THE TABLE, THE MORE SHE HAS TO
RAN EVERY CAMPAIGN PERFECTLY.
WE KNOW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.
>> IN TERMS OF CAMPAIGN ISSUES,
REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO KEEP
RETIRING REPUBLICAN DARRELL
ISSA'S SEAT WITH AN AGENDA THAT
MIRROR'S PRESIDENT TRUMP'S.
>> TAXES ARE HUGE.
SO IS THE SANCTUARY STATE, THE
CATCH AND RELEASE.
EVERYTHING HAPPENED OUT OF
SACRAMENTO IS HITTING HARD.
ALL THE DEMOCRATS HAVE IS
RESIST.
>> DEMOCRATS IN THAT DISTRICT
THINK THAT THEY HAVE GOT THE
UPPER HAND.
ONE OF THE TOP DEMOCRATIC
CONTENDERS MIKE LEVIN SAYS HE
THINKS HE CAN CLEAN UP THE
SAN DIEGO COASTLINE THAN DARRELL
ISSA WAS ABLE TO AS THE REP.
NEIL?
>> Neil: THANKS.
LET'S GO TO TOM BEVIN FROM REAL
CLEAR POLITICS.
THE BLUE WAVE WAS THE CONSENSUS
OPINION.
NOW IMPROVING ECONOMIC NUMBERS,
THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT AND
GROWING PERCEPTIONS ON THE PART
OF MANY AMERICANS THAT WELL,
MAYBE KEEPING REPUBLICANS IN
CHARGE OF CONGRESS IS NOT A BAD
IDEA.
THAT TOO CAN CHANGE.
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
>> WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, NEIL.
IF THE COMMIT, THE PRESIDENT'S
JOB APPROVAL IS UP, THE GENERIC
BALLOT HAS BEEN SLIDING FOR THE
DEMOCRATS.
THINGS ARE LOOKING BETTER FOR
REPUBLICANS THAN THEY WERE A FEW
WEEKS AGO.
PETER IS RIGHT.
FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS IN
PARTICULAR, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
IS THE KEY.
THERE'S SEVEN DISTRICTS IN THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HILLARY
CLINTON WON IN 2016.
THEY'RE TARGETING THE THREE IN
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN
PARTICULAR.
IF THEY GET SHUTOUT OF THOSE
RACES IN NOVEMBER, THAT WILL BE
A SIGNIFICANT BLOW OF
RECAPTURING HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
>> Neil: WHAT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
EXPLAINING TO ME, THIS NEW
PROCEDURE THAT STARTED UNDER
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER THAT THEY
WOULD ALLOW THE TOP TWO
FINISHERS TO BE THE WINNERS IN A
PRIMARY BATTLE SO OPEN TO BOTH
SIDES, SEE HOW IT GOES, IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO INCREASE A
MODERATION IN POLITICS, THAT
MODERATES WOULD WIN AND NOT
NECESSARILY A BAD THING AND THAT
DEMOCRATS ARE SALIVATING AT THE
PROSPECT THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD
FOR THEM.
UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY DEMOCRATS
ENTERED AND COULD BE DIVIDING
THE VOTE.
>> YEAH.
IT'S BEST OF INTENTION BUT
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THIS WOULD
GIVE US A HAND WHERE THERE'S
MORE DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS.
THERE'S SO MANY DEMOCRATS EAGER
TO RUN, PASSIONATE ABOUT
RESISTANCE, WANT TO FIGHT
AGAINST TRUMP, ET CETERA.
YOU FOUND IN A FEW DISTRICTS THE
PARTIES HAD A TOUGH TIME TRYING
TO CONTROL THEM.
NOBODY WILL DROP OUT.
THEY'RE FIGHTING TOOTH AND NAIL.
IT IS SPLITTING THE VOTE,
CAUSING THEM BIG TIME PROBLEMS.
AGAIN, IF THEY CAN SHUTOUT ONE,
TWO OR ALL THREE RACES, IT'S
GOING TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM
FOR THEM COME NOVEMBER.
>> Neil: AREN'T THE ONES ANGRY
THE MORE LIKELY TO GET TO THE
POLES AND THOSE SATISFIED WITH
THE ECONOMY, THE MARKETS OR BOTH
LESS LIKELY?
ISN'T THAT THE CLASSIC RULE OF
THUMB?
>> Neil: WELL, LOOK, I THINK
THAT -- YOU BRING UP A GREAT
POINT, WHICH IS FOR REPUBLICANS,
THE GOOD ECONOMY IS A DOUBLE
EDGE SORT.
THE BETTER IT IS, THE MORE
PEOPLE WORE PRY ABOUT OTHER
THINGS, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION.
COULD BE A DRAG ON THEM.
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ENERGIZED
THIS YEAR.
BUT AGAIN, WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY
COMPETITIVE CANDIDATES IN THESE
SEATS, YOU KNOW, DILUTING THE
VOTE, SPLITTING THE VOTE.
IN NOVEMBER, IT'S ABOUT TURNING
OUT YOUR VOTERS.
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THE EDGE WITH
ENTHUSIASM.
BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE ERASED THAT
EDGE.
