COMMITTEE AND WILL JOIN US LIVE
ON "AMERICA'S NEWSROOM" AND
WE'LL GET MORE FROM THAT NEXT
HOUR.
>> Sandra:  FORMER PRESIDENT
OBAMA GIVING HIMSELF A PAT ON
THE BACK CLAIMING HE DID NOT
HAVE ANY SCANDALS DURING HIS
EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE.
THE FORMER PRESIDENT MAKING THE
REMARKS AT A TECH CONFERENCE IN
LAS VEGAS SAYING, QUOTE, I
DIDN'T HAVE SCANDALS, WHICH
SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULDN'T BE
SOMETHING YOU BRAG ABOUT.
JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS
POLITICAL ANALYST AND RACHEL
CAMPOS DUFFY.
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU AND YOUR
PARTY DISAGREE WITH THAT
STATEMENT, RACHEL.
>> THAT'S SO LAUGHABLE.
FIRST OF ALL WE'RE SITTING ON
THE MOTHER OF ALL SCANDALS
SPYGATE.
WHEN THIS ONION IS UNPEELED IT
WILL GO ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
OF THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT,
VALERIE JARRETT AND BARACK
OBAMA HIMSELF.
THEY WILL GET THERE IF THE
PRESS LETS US DO THAT IN
REALTIME.
THE OBAMA LEGACY IS ONE OF
USING THE TOOLS OF GOVERNMENT
TO RUTHLESSLY TAKE DOWN
OPPONENTS.
THAT'S WHAT HE DID I.R.S.
SCANDAL.
HE USED THE D.O.J. AND F.B.I.
BY THE WAY, TO GO AFTER DONALD
TRUMP.
THOSE THREE INSTITUTIONS HAS
DESTROYED THE CREDIBILITY OF
THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS A
SCANDAL IN AND OF ITSELF.
WE CAN GO TO FAST AND FURIOUS.
IMAGINE IF DONALD TRUMP HAD
SOLD WEAPONS TO MEXICAN DRUG
LORDS AND THOSE WEAPONS WERE
USED TO KILL INNOCENT MEXICANS
AND OUR OWN BORDER PATROL.
THE FACT THAT THE PRESS OR THE
MAINSTREAM LIBERAL PRESS HAS
NOT REPORTED ON IT DOESN'T --
WITH THE SERIOUSNESS THAT IT
DESERVES DOESN'T MEAN THAT
THESE AREN'T SERIOUS SCANDALS.
>> Sandra:  SHE IS POINTING OUT
IRS.
FAST AND FURIOUS, BENGHAZI.
>> I'M LISTENING WITH A SMILE.
IT SEEMS TO ME AMUSING.
WHAT A DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE OF
SCANDAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT IN OFFICE
WHO WAS REVEALED TO BE -- HAVE
KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE LIED ABOUT
SECRETLY PAYING MONEY TO A PORN
STAR.
>> Sandra:  HOLD ON.
OBAMA SAYS HE HAD NO SCANDALS
WHILE IN OFFICE.
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
WHO IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
WAS INDICTED AND WENT TO JAIL?
I DON'T THINK THAT HAPPENED.
I JUST THINK THAT, IN FACT, HE
WAS AN EXAMPLE OF SORT OF THE
FLAWED EXAMPLE OF CONSTANT
INVESTIGATIONS BY GOP INTO
BENGHAZI AND FAST AND FURIOUS.
ERIC HOLDER WAS HELD IN
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.
NOBODY WAS SENT TO JAIL.
NO FINDINGS.
>> THE ONLY ATTORNEY GENERAL
MEMBER OF ANY CABINET EVER HELD
IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS IS ERIC
HOLDER BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO
COOPERATE WITH CONGRESS IN
INVESTIGATING FAST AND FURIOUS.
WHAT ABOUT --
>> THEY KEPT BADGERING HIM.
>> Sandra:  LET ME TELL YOU
WHERE THE BAR IS.
HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT --
THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAID, JUAN.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF
THE MODERN PRESIDENCY, COMING
OUT OF THE MODERN PRESIDENCY
WITHOUT ANYBODY GOING TO JAIL
IS REALLY GOOD.
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
IS THAT WHERE THE BAR IS?
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE MUELLER
INVESTIGATION INDICTMENTS OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.
WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.
IF YOU WANT TO COMPARE.
WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI, WHAT ABOUT
FAST AND FURIOUS?
IF YOU CAN'T TO TALK ABOUT
SCOTT PRUITT OR THE EVENTS IN
NIGER WHERE WE LOST FOUR MEN.
NOT THE SAME LEVEL.
>> Sandra:  HE BROUGHT THIS UP
HIMSELF AND WHY WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT IT.
HE IS PATTING HIMSELF ON THE
BACK EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT A
SCANDAL AND WENT ON TO SAY NO
ONE IN MY WHITE HOUSE GOT IN
TROUBLE FOR SCREWING UP.
AS LONG AS THERE WASN'T
MALICIOUS INTENT BEHIND IT,
RACHEL.
>> Sandra:  IT'S RIDICULOUS.
HE KNEW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S
SERVER AND EMAILED HER ON IT
AND HE HAD HIS A.G. WORK TO
CALL IT JUST A MATTER AND HE
HAD A COMPLIANT PRESS.
WE HAD A PRESS WHO KNEW THAT
BARACK OBAMA SPIED ON
JOURNALISTS AND THE JOURNALISTS
IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DIDN'T
IS SEEM TO CARE ABOUT IT.
I THINK SPYGATE IS THE MOTHER
OF ALL SCANDALS.
WHEN THIS COMES DOWN AND WHEN
WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT
MAYBE WE'LL HEAR IN REALTIME BY
THE JOURNALISTS NOW.
IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS
THE WORST SCANDAL EVER.
