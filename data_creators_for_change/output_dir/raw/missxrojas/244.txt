00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
hey guys today we are sitting back in

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,360
the kitchen but this time under the

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,220
penguin postcards to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I'm not as keen on as everyone</font>

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,440
else seems to be Christmas however I

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,580
didn't want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,040
about some Christmas be things that I've

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,410
been enjoying firstly obviously the

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">killer's christmas single it's an animal</font>

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,189
van and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love it i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know how</font>

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,510
much i love the<font color="#E5E5E5"> killers today as i</font>

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,490
mentioned listen like every video for

13
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">past five years of my life but this year</font>

14
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,269
in particular because their song

15
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,220
christmas in<font color="#CCCCCC"> LA features one of my</font>

16
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,170
favorite Elia bands doors<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

17
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,668
introduced to doors by my friend Ariana

18
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,620
about two and a half years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> and is</font>

19
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,850
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the music that was playing on</font>

20
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,110
the car<font color="#CCCCCC"> when everything was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

21
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,750
my dad and it's like that their band I

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">associate very strong you at that time</font>

23
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,870
but their music is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

24
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,090
beautiful my favorite songs probably

25
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,039
good rest my soul<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the killers and</font>

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,230
doors what a wonderful match the song<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

27
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,640
all about to send rest and

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,500
disillusionment through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas which</font>

29
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,690
I can kind of identify within a lot of

30
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,760
ways but mainly it's a cracking song

31
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,410
that I bet my flatmates getting very

32
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,270
sick of hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> me play on repeat the</font>

33
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,710
second thing and this isn't necessarily

34
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,750
a christmas thing because they started

35
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,519
couple of months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago mine open</font>

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,740
supermarkets had these Glade candles and

37
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,750
sell everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know loves candles and</font>

38
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,640
subsist with candles everyone loves

39
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,229
candles I'm pretty like a movement

40
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,090
towards candles I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a decent</font>

41
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">tea light these are really nice this is</font>

42
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,570
I think cinnamon or something else Apple

43
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,310
maybe another thing that I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

44
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,049
talk about christmas nails cuz i have

45
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,700
some of my controversial opinions about

46
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,530
them but quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years in a row I've</font>

47
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">worn the berry and it's sparkly sparkle</font>

48
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,549
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the official name is red</font>

49
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,710
glitter that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very ritual and I love</font>

Barry I'm i love all their products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

51
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,070
i love how ethical they are and all this

52
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,500
stuff however this is a bloody nightmare

53
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,110
I hate getting us off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually</font>

54
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">really dampens my whole winter</font>

55
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,520
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sparkles so well and i</font>

56
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560

59
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,439
one of my favorite bright<font color="#CCCCCC"> red now</font>

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,020
varnishes which is the nails inc red one

such a fashion

63
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,590
and then another important one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea</font>

64
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,660

company i really<font color="#E5E5E5"> love his teeth eggs and</font>

71
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,590
then tweeted about them because i really

72
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,720
loved their licorice and peppermint tea

73
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,780
and they sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a packet of spiced</font>

74
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,640
winter red tea but the back at his

enemies actually not this packet this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

76
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,180

yummy that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like cinnamon is my</font>

82
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,580
number one spices make Christmas for me

83
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,620
spices and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I enjoy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

84
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,450
who love winter<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about loving being</font>

85
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,550
warm and bundled and whatever if I pick

86
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,380
something would probably be the spices

87
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,790
that makes her way into everything like

88
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,850
I always loved having my mom's apple

89
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,530
crumble woods I clothes in it and stuff

90
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,180
like when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a school I'd come home</font>

91
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,070
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just something that would warm you</font>

92
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,930
up kind of from the inside out it was

93
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,190
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great but the answer is</font>

94
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,290
not necessarily winter even then cover

95
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,269
of this is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> wintry and I have spoken</font>

96
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,590
about this before but i think it was

97
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,660
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> some years ago so Oscar Wilde</font>

98
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,519
stories the children collection and it's

99
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,260
his fairy tales basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is a</font>

100
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,570
lovely addition has some really

101
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,030
beautiful illustrations this one in the

102
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,160
nightingale on the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this edition</font>

103
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,900
is published by quarter the

104
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,970
illustrations<font color="#CCCCCC"> are by PJ Lynch and for</font>

105
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,640
some reason the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of creepy sad edge</font>

106
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,580
to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us go of fairy tales really</font>

107
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,540
makes me get in the mood<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

108
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,140
mythology of Christmas or it is most the

109
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,299
most level that I can get maybe that

110
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,010
makes sense the whole Christmas period

111
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,600
in the whole winter period is extremely

112
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,519
melancholy and the fairy tales<font color="#CCCCCC"> are slow</font>

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,530
melancholy especially the nightingale on

114
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rose which if you haven't read it</font>

115
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,519
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that long please read it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oscar</font>

116
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,900
while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to read it in fancy</font>

117
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,060
addition you can find it cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> edition</font>

118
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,530
than that and while I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> cry when I</font>

119
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,880
read it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of feel something</font>

120
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,280
breaking inside of me and for some

121
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,890
reason that's enjoy

122
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,660
and I associate it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> wintertime the</font>

123
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,400
final big Christmas thing for me

124
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoo-hoo is the Nob Hill winner is my</font>

125

boy which you might also knows the

127
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,690
poinsettias another thing that I guess

128
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,608
just like re-creates Christmas at home

129
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,858
