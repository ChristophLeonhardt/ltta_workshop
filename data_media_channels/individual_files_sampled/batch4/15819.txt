it's July 12th I'm Ezra levan and you're watching battleground hello my friends had a few foes who join in every day at 12:00 noon Eastern Time I talked for an hour off-the-cuff we have some videos we play we show some websites but the main feature of our daily chitchat at 12:00 noon Eastern Time 5 p.m. in London England is the live chat as you can see to the right of the screen are comments that anyone can make and YouTube's invented something called super chat where for a couple of pounds a couple of dollars few pesos you can have your comments appended to the top and put in bright highlight for everyone to see and I keep an eye out in the corner of my eye for those and I like to read those I've got some news about Tommy Robinson that I'm gonna share but we've got 60 people watching right now I'm gonna wait a couple of minutes til til the numbers get up and I'll share those with you we have a few things I want to cover today in addition to my Tommy news the NATO hearings in Latvia Donald Trump very ferocious demanding that countries in NATO spend at least two percent of their GDP on the military the United States spends almost four percent Canada spends 1.3 percent that's falling to 1.2 percent this year I want to show you Justin Trudeau's attempt to to bluster his way through that I don't think it's very convincing speaking of bluster I'll show you an embarrassing moment of how Justin Trudeau greeted the Belgian prime minister spoiler alert he he didn't he bypassed the Belgium p.m. and went in for a kiss on the wife and that's you could say well that's just a French thing the the hair kisses that she kisses but yeah if you're in the middle of a groping scandal maybe maybe that's not what you do and then I want to talk about Trump in the UK Donald Trump his is off for a visit to the UK and a poll show that actually more Brits support him then oppose him it's just the media party that's all freaked out about it all right we got a hundred and twenty five folks online so let me tell you some news this morning I spoke to several members of Tommy's family as well as to Tommy's lawyers and I have three pieces of news to share with you and it's incredible actually the first piece of news I just want to make sure I'm spelling everything right because there's a name I want to share with you as you may know a couple weeks ago an outrage happened the government delayed Tommy's court date for the legal appeals by two weeks tommy was supposed to have his appeal on the 10th of July as in two days ago and the government said no no we need more time as if two months wasn't long enough so they kicked the can down the road two weeks July 24th it was a bit of an outrage the judge was a powerful judge just justice Brian lives in the head of all the criminal courts in the United Kingdom the top dog for criminal justice in the UK he was going to hear the matter I thought that's pretty exciting so that was set for July 24th top judge top court frustrating that it was delayed two weeks but there it is so today I'm I spoke with a family and I have unbelievable news the court date has been moved but it's not being pushed further into the future it's being pulled closer to the present the new court date is July 18th less than a week from today still at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on the Strand so it's coming almost a week earlier and they've changed up the judges and this this is what I wanted to make sure I got this exactly right because I was not familiar with this fella it is now gonna be mm a three-judge panel that's pretty serious isn't it I'm the judge presiding over the three well his name is Sir Ian Burnett and he is the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales he is the top judge in the entire United Kingdom justice Brian leb s'en who I told you about before he's the top criminal judge which I thought was pretty impressive but this judge Sir Ian Burnett he is the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales this is like if this were in the United States if the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court himself with two other judges beneath him were to hear Tommy's case that there is no higher judge there is no more senior judge in the entire United Kingdom and I say again he's got a three-judge panel this be this I think is appropriate because Tommy's case is the most important case in the UK in terms of freedom of speech and Tommy's rights and the politicization of the judiciary I think the manner in which Tommy was convicted and sentenced in such haste is outrageous and if anyone can right the wrongs I think it is the Lord Chief Justice himself I just did I'm unfamiliar with those in the wrinkles of the British legal system of course my law degree was in Canada we don't have something called the Lord Chief Justice we have Chief Justice's etc but we don't have the same history of the legal history and then you came that is a position that goes back almost 800 years almost to the Magna Carta it is such a senior office and I am incredibly encouraged that the Lord Chief Justice Sir Ian Burnett is now gonna be presiding over a three-judge panel for Tamir ah what do you think so we got two pieces of news piece number one the date has changed July 18 that's good one last week Tommy has to be in prison piece of information number two incredible the it would it really is actually it's bigger than that because the the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is the top tippy top top dog but he's not the boss of all the other judges right the Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales really is in even some ways to the Supreme Court justice the Chief Justice Supreme Court United States isn't he's the top dog I mean unless Theresa May herself would sit in judgment there is no higher office in the United Kingdom that's incredible now the third piece of news I have is more personal Tommy through his wife another family members and lawyer has requested that I personally attend and I said why I was you don't think about it anyways obviously and the requests from Tommy that I received I did not talk to Tommy personally but he talks to the family and I received two contacts from the family this morning or said I go and report because Tommy is worried that the reportage will not be fair and accurate from the mainstream media and obviously I agree if you and I see there's a super chat there from Melvina moorland I'll come back to you in a minute thank you moving it if you follow the UK press and I sort of do I've got a Google Alert for Tommy Robinson maybe you do too you know what I mean you set up a Google News Alert and anytime there's a new story it gets sent to me and because I'm curious of how the media is covering Tommy and the answer is very poorly they either don't cover important news they spin what they do cover they cannot hide their antipathy towards him and in some cases say outright lie they outright lie it's one thing to spin things it's one thing to have a heavy opinion that's negative all right that's fine but to outright provide misinformation fake news is Donald Trump insane so Tommy is worried that his appeal on July 18th in front of Sir Ian Burnett Lord Chief Justice and the entire UK company is worried that even if he has a win in court it will be you know defeat will be snatched from the jaws of victory by the lying fake news and I agree I think that there will not be a single sympathetic journalist in that court and of the mainstream media so they're gonna lie now I think there may be some I think there may be some citizen journalists who attend who are fair to Tommy but I don't know what kind of a platform or audience they have and they may not be legally savvy I'm a former lawyer myself I used to work with Tommy especially in the relevant matter of his contempt of court trial in Canterbury a year ago so I'm familiar with Tommy's legal background I'm familiar with contempt of court law in the UK and I've been through this before it saw my first rodeo is the same so Tommy says as you're coming to the London I say sure but obviously I'm not gonna pay for that from the safe Tommy calm crowdfund because that is just for his legal fees and a hundred percent of the surplus goes to the family so I'm gonna have a separate crowd fund just to get me to London I booked my flight and hotel when you booked at last minute it's expensive if you can help me out to get to London I need to fly there and I need two nights in the hotel and it's over 24 we I forget how much about 24 25 hundred bucks if you can help me please go to Tommy trial Kong could we put that website up so here's the details if you go to Tommy Trial calm we've got the details of the name of the judge the details of the date Tommy's requested me to come it's about twenty five hundred bucks to get there if you can help me out please do much Moran said pay your own bills Ezra yeah well Tommy wants me to fly to London then that's about 2,500 bucks and we don't have any big benefactors we're crowdfunding if you don't want to pay you don't have to I'm just saying if you want to help please do I expect that I will probably do ten video updates from the court during breaks in the court after the court I will seek permission to actually tweet from the courtroom obviously I'm not going to be talking in the courtroom on video I'll do those during breaks but if I can get permission from the court I will continuously live-tweet the event that might be a very useful thing to do if you want to help me get over there please do obviously I'm not going to take money from Tommy's legal offense because this is not his legal defense but it's a journalistic thing this if you don't want to chip in you don't have to that's the fun thing about crowdfunding if you want to be a free rider you can if you want to help out you can Melvina Moreland says think the delay was so Tommy Robinson would miss president Trump visit it wouldn't surprise me it wouldn't surprise me Tommy he taught me the word a stitch-up which sort of means an inside job you were framed the thing was done from the inside there's been so many stitch ups it's a stitch up to send him from a safe prison in HMP hull to a dangerous prison dominated by Muslim criminal gangs HMP oddly that's a stitch-up there's a reason for that it's not justified in law that's just to put Tommy in legal jeopardy or to put him in solitary confinement which is what they knew Tommy would do to protect his life so yeah it's a stitch-up and why did they change the date the first time oh they said they needed more time I'm sorry I don't believe that I don't believe that the Attorney General of the United Kingdom who has more lawyers than this disposal any other person in all of Europe I just do not believe that he needed you know an extra two weeks for the case so yeah it's a stitch-up and i have no doubt that there's political reason for that partly because Tommy has a demonstration this Saturday in London that they didn't want him to be at and partly because it Trump absolutely and if you disagree with that if he had speculation give me your contrary hypothesis are you telling me that the Attorney General of the United Kingdom the law who has more lawyers at its disposal than any other man in Europe that he couldn't get the work done in time that maybe he didn't couldn't get the paperwork he is the custodian of all the records maybe he couldn't get the transcript from the trial or something like what possible excuse could there be for the government of the United Kingdom with an unlimited legal budget and unlimited lawyers unlimited expertise unlimited access to the documents what possible excuse could there be they're not ready for an appeal two months after the conviction I'm sorry I was born at night but not last night let me read some more comments John Zealand Ezzor are you going to have security hope so I don't I don't think so I don't think I need security to be at the court the Royal Courts of Justice in the United Kingdom I think there will be court police there and I do not think that I am well enough known that I would be in jeopardy and even if I were well enough known in the UK to be in jeopardy I do not think I would be in jeopardy at that site tami pretend sambel stitch-up yes I think that's accurate yeah well that's the first time he taught me and you know someone says all it's rigged I'm framed and you think yeah everybody says that well I think it's time this case is true Ryan's six 85-84 says here it can't get will ders can't come now yeah can you talk about stitch-up as you know here at Builders spelled geert wilders the the second leading politician in Holland leader of the party for freedom he spoke at Tommy's round the last month he was invited back he was going to speak this Saturday and Theresa May had the foreign secretary advised that number one Builders would not have any police security from British police and number two he wasn't allowed to bring his Dutch Diplomatic Security so effectively he's banned from coming to the rally I imagine saying to a foreign diplomat an ally a friend a liberal democracy second and you know second largest party you're banned from having security if you come to London I should remind you that the king of Saudi Arabia recently came to London Russian oligarchs come all the time to London they have private security all the bad people in the world coat of Lenin they have private security but Theresa May said no here bill they're sorry you're coming for Tommy Robinson you may not bring security either your own and we certainly will not provide you security basically they said if you come you'll die sort of like moving Tommy from prison and hell to prison and only so yeah a stitch-up when you do that so brazenly in public imagine what you're doing secretly in private a stitch-up exactly right and Ruby Ezra don't get arrested for contempt of court well you're not just joking that's why setting in the check with the court before I tweet from the courthouse you don't want to be tweeting in the courthouse if that's against the rules let me read some more here Jake writes as protest for Tommy Robinson this Saturday 3 p.m. Whitehall London yes I've been referring to that and here at Vilnius will not be attending I I don't know who will be attending but I encourage people to attend Kerma Fox says it won't be fair accurate Tommy is right yeah and you know I just I just feel like if I wasn't there I would be here in Canada trying to glean facts to comment on those facts but if I'm relying on the BBC for those facts it's you know and it's like a blind eye be the blind man because not only would I know that I'm not getting all the facts but the fact that they put forward I don't even know if I could trust them I got to be there to see what's going on I wouldn't trust anyone else I'm speaking for myself I mean maybe you trust other people and if I wasn't there I would have to make do right I wasn't there when Tommy had his drumhead trial sentence conviction in Leeds a couple months ago so I am relying on secondhand third-hand reports there why wouldn't I attend if I could El Chupacabra says avi emini will be at the Tommy protest that's great he's an Australian Tommy supporter I'm impressed that he's coming all the way from Australia that's that's great see Fort evidence says mr. builders need not be afraid we would protect the man ourselves well I know that's probably true but he needs professional security and he needs intelligence also because we're not just talking about a scuffle we're talking about people who would assassinate him in a professional awful hit job style I'm sorry that's out is amandajoy Ezra why is the UK government hell-bent on removing free speech well because free speech is the tool of their opponents to shine a light of public scrutiny on what they're doing wrong and Tommy uses free speech to shine a light of scrutiny on the mass industrial scale rape of young British girls and I mean young girls as young as 11 in the case you're discovering it leads so if you're the government what's easier to do solve the rape gang problem or shut up Tommy Robinson it's the path of least resistance am i right Paul Palmer you have a lot of support in the UK s right well thanks Paul I mean I really haven't done a lot of videos in the UK other than a few Tommy Robinson update videos I've left that to other talents we had Tommy working for us for a year we've got Jack buck B we've got Katie Hopkins we have Martina Marquez she is there she's not a Brit by background but she is based there so we do have some Brits and I don't pretend that I'm well-known in the UK I mean I love the UK and of course I do have some viewers everywhere but I don't think I have a critical mass there let me just read some more Gabriel Swift once again it'll be the working-class who end up fighting to save Britain well your sir I was just thinking about that the other day I mean I grew up the way I grew up in Canada in in Britain it would be called middle-class mayor my father was a doctor I went to a Jewish school then I went to a public school that's what you know just to school anyone goes to government schools I don't know what they call in the UK we weren't particularly snobby but we just didn't we weren't working class or blue-collar but how I felt especially growing up in the Western Province of Alberta I felt like we we were in a real meritocracy and no one ever said well where are you from or what school did you go to or who's your dad or like there was none of that pedigree checking it just wasn't a thing and if there was someone who worked his way up from nothing we sort of had that american-style spirit of attaboy rags to riches story he used to be celebrated I want to be like him like there's none of this know your place business Canada and the United States and especially Alberta where I was born it's not about know your place you know what but it was until I met Tommy that I realized how much of a thing that is in the UK and I think it's a snobbery and I don't think it's legitimate I'm not saying everyone practices it but there's a real thing because a lot of the victims of these Muslim rape gangs I'd say almost exclusively are working-class British girls who are not connected not fancy not rich not lawyered up not with media or political friends as Morrissey says they're nobodies nothing's and Tommy is their voice and what what follows my mind never told you this story before is how the Labour Party which claimed to represent the working-class is so not only silent on these issues of rape but they have been colonized by Muslim extremists I think of Nazz Shah the British Labour MP Muslim woman who actually retweeted to the rape victims of I think it was rather a more Rochdale shut up for the sake of public harmony telling rape victims to shut up because she didn't want criticism of his lamb just outraged I see another super sweet free Tommy Gabriel Swift yeah we're trying our best hey did I did did you see yesterday the news we got a free Tommy Robinson ringtone did you were you here yesterday when I said that you know that hey Tommy Tommy we got that as a ringtone now we've got a lot of websites say can you put the Tommy ringtone website up there it is if you want if you want your time a ringtone I got that on you know what I've got I've got that really is my ringtone and so this morning my phone goes Oh Tommy Tommy my phone starts saying that and who's who's it it's Tommy's family calling with the Tommy ringtone that was a funny moment for me can I encourage you to do that and if you've never changed your ringtone it can be tricky if you're old and dumb like me but on that website we have to like instructional YouTube videos how to do it I followed one of them and if I can figure it out you can figure it out can I encourage you to do that because it's fun first of all reminds you Tommy and I'm not obsessed or anything I just feel like I I've got its mission and when this mission is done I'll take a break yeah I'm not obsessed with Tommy I mean he worked for us for a year it was good and its ups and downs and then he left and you know he wasn't on my mind a lot but now he's in prison and we got to help him so I'm when we when when we got him free I'll calm down and we won't talk about him all the time but until then we got to stay on it because if we don't what you think Amnesty International is going to help them you think Reporters Without Borders going to helping you think Penn internationals going to help them you think Human Rights Watch is going to helping you think the United Nations going to help them you think the Labour Party the Conservative Party even the other Gerard a baton of you Kip and anna-marie waters of for Britain you think any public Lord Pearson of you Kip but I just think I just named them all Piers Morgan who you know likes to fight with Tommy I would put it to Piers Morgan probably agrees with about 80% when Tommy says he just doesn't want to admit it where's Pierce Morgan fighting for Tommy yeah I know they disagree with each other but don't you don't you want to stand up for the freedom of speech Tommy's in jail today you might be in jail next week or you think you're too powerful I've never happened to you well that's the thing about freedom you got to fight in the first stitch it's easier to fight in the first stitch to fight in the last stitch that's what we're doing so we're filling the void here and God willing on July 18th if Tommy Robinson wins his appeal you know we'll have a handshake and a hug and and then we'll all go back to our normal lives and hopefully Tommy will stay out of jail and we'll just do whatever we do here in Canada but until then we're gonna stay on and let me tell you if you get that ringtone it's a lot of fun and and people say what's that and you can tell them the story it's a fun it's a fun thing all right enough is about that xeno is to says I wish we had a leader like Trump instead of our pathetic turds I'm judging by your avatar that year in the United Kingdom Kevin Lee Poland Italy and Hungary are done changing Western culture also Brits are not leaders anymore there's a little bit of truth there this little bit of truth hopefully the UK I wake up Tommy's trying to help wake up the UK brexit should have woken up the UK but they're trying to spawn to that and Ruby says Ezra it's Oh Tommy Tommy yeah that's the that's the ringtone we took go to go - Tommy ringing tone comm Tommy ring tone comm and you can download it for free it's just the ring tones no it's no big deal I'm just saying it's fun that's all I'm just looking through the tweets here Tammy potencies and Belt says seek girls were targeted to this community banded together to stop it you're exactly right and one of Tommy's buddies is a Sikh fella named Mohan he's quite a figure can we call up some b-roll of Tommy and Mohan Singh he's with I think it's called the Sikh awareness Society and it's he's focused like a laser on protecting see girls because of course Muslim rankings mainly they're predators targeting white girls but they also target Sikh girls I'm just saying what what happens so this guy Mohan sink he's he spends his whole life driving around the UK going from Sikh temple I'm a they're called gurdwaras or something I pronounced that warning them helping them trying to rescue the girls trying to pull him out even moving Sikh girls to different towns to get them away from these Muslim predators it's quite something do we have that yet can we get a alright no wait for that he's quite a figure sometimes he walks around with a sword he's dressed in flowing robes he's got the it's got a ferocity to him it's no big deal all right well you know what we I saw there was a comment about Trump so we have a poll I want to show you a YouGov poll of you gave us the name of a polling guys like Gallup poll in the United States you gov is a pollster in the UK and with all the Trump derangement syndrome could we put that poll up there we go Donald here's the question from you go Donald Trump is being invited to make an official state visit working visit to Britain do you think this should go ahead or should it be cancelled now that's sort of a dumb question but Green says it should be canceled blues should go ahead and about half a Brit said go ahead and about a third of Brits say cancel now it's stupid even if even if most bridge said should be canceled the sentence something you decide by vote it's you know governments meet with each other like I said the king of Saudi Arabia went to the United Kingdom you know tyrants tyrants love London it's an amazing city it's a great city if you have a lot of money it's got history it's got great it's got a great everything London is one of the most amazing cities in the world and tyrants are welcome there I hate to say it or maybe that's a great thing maybe it's great that everyone can go there including tyrants I don't know but this just proves that the mania on the left well it's not everyone not everyone has that point of view I want to show you though in Canada our own state broadcaster is trying to try to get in on in the trumped arrangement here take a look at this 90 second clip from our own state yes take a look at this thousands of protesters are expected to pack the streets for Trump's visit the US Embassy is actually warning America as it London to steer clear of protests or to keep their heads down but that might be hard to do our senior correspondent Susan ormiston explains why President Donald Trump isn't even in the UK and already the protests have started and here's a rather amusing way for protesters to show they're not so keen on his visit here to the UK here you have it the Donald Trump inflatable baby they crowd funded this project they got more money than they needed to build this and they're going to fly it near the Parliament Buildings on Friday when big demonstrations are expected here in London you got to love the detail look at this there's a cell phone in his hand for those emergency tweets he'll be making he's already said a few things about British politics that they're in turmoil organizers say that many people here in Britain are opposed to Trump and his policies they say he's an unreliable allied to Britain and they want him to see this symbol he may not because he's stopping very briefly in London and then going out to the country the separately going to checkers the Prime Minister's country residents and to Windsor to visit the Queen but not spending a lot of time in London and he'll be in Scotland for the weekend they may deflate this and card it up to Scotland just for that Susan ormiston CBC News London she's so excited she's so excited now I had heard of this blimp or they call it the blump the Trump blimp I thought it was massive so it looks like it's about 20 feet high that's that's sort of funny I don't really know I mean it's it's a baby Trump as a baby I I guess that's supposed to be really hurtful or something the cell phone maybe that's supposed to be really hurtful I don't know I think Trump loves tweeting that was a minute and a half of pure love by Canada's state broadcaster for anti Trump arrangement in the UK sort of a big nothing I got to say and even the intro from state broadcaster headquarters in in Toronto thousands of protesters there's millions I don't know the exact population of London is I'm probably throughout 10 million there's a thousand people protest anything in London Tommy himself has had 5000 Pro Tommy protesters in Manchester it looks a little bit pitiful to be I'm not saying they won't be out in force I mean every hater that combination of leftist alt left labor rights antipholus traun in the UK and of course all the Muslim supremacist including I'd put in that category the Mayor of London sure they're gonna be out but I got to say that Trump blimp it's a little pitiful like it's a lot smile it's not the size of a blimp it's like a it's like a bouncy castle it's sort of lame it's sort of lame that the CBC gave it 90 seconds like that but I think the fact that sadek can the Muslim Mayor of London is approving it and endorsing it I think that's the lamest part of all I say again London is one of the world great cities if you've never been there you surely must go and you should go quickly but as it's becoming is Lama fide and criminalized and there's more murders there's more shootings in London now than in New York City that's sort of embarrassing for the Brits I mean they're saying for whoever has a lot of shootings but London's still a great city and if this is the best London wants the world to see we have a small Trump blimp and that's what we have to show the world I mean when the you know when the world's eyes are on your city that's what you want to showcase you sort of come down a bit in the world haven't you let me read some more comments if I missed any have I missed any of the super chests I don't think I have if I have my team will surely tell me dr. Rowsey says London is Stan acid land yeah this is weird thing where people boot around London and mopeds throwing acid at people it's just a bizarre thing and that's sad Atkins London gzip 1982 says 8 million population in London all right well I wasn't far off when I said 10 dr. Sheryl Ezra to have paid comments you have to enable them yeah I guess so I think you'd probably have to sign in you have to probably get an account on YouTube because otherwise how would you how would you do that right so I don't think it takes that that long to set up you just have to become a you have a youtube account and it's it's not that hard to do Jerald say do you 500 viewers that's it yeah this looks like 555 viewers now but when this live chat is done it becomes a regular video the chat part is disabled people see the chest they just can't make new chats and these videos simply get a few thousand views it's just a fun thing to do every every day at noon which is what I do I see a new super shot from jolly jester five bucks what do you think about the increase in transgender books like I am jazz being read to children including kindergarten in Canadian schools well you got a tune in the nine o'clock today I just recorded an interview with Tanya Granick Allen who ran for the the Ontario Conservative Party in large part on a campaign to remove the extreme child sex ed curriculum in Ontario and that was in fact abolished this week by Ontario's Conservatives and we had a bit of a chat about that and she talked about other trans issues on the show you should tune in at a p.m. for my show where I go in at some great length on that but I agree with you I think that you know there are something and even I mean I have my quarrels with transgenderism that I won't go into now but even if you're for it I think we can all agree keep it away from children of ten two years what the hell are you doing telling eight-year-old kids about transgenderism other than to recruit them and plant weird idea when you're eight your pre sexual you even Freud talked about a latency you know Keith McIntosh from Mexico have recently noted ads on rebel videos where none existed before something changed making youtube revenue again you know Keith I've noted that as well and I find it a little green shoot of hope I should tell you though that the dollar amount is still quite low and we are nowhere near where we were before the great D monetization of January February 2017 so yes there are YouTube videos where there weren't before I also see that on pages of other conservatives who were blacklisted by YouTube before but I don't want to break up the champagne because alas we are still 80 percent down from where we were before the D monetization no miracle Ezra will be covering the trial and you came here but Tommy Robinson ringtone now you know that Tommy Robinson chat yeah that's some news I had him I'm gonna go Gavin Betts I'm from Sheffield UK and I love Trump he's awesome and I'm sick of all the Trump bashing here can we Google the mayor of Sheffield who was dressed up in a Mexican sombrero and he tweeted a picture of himself mocking Trump I don't know much about Sheffield the first I heard of Sheffield was the HMS Sheffield a frigate or a destroyer yeah yeah go ahead put it put it up there's the mayor of Sheffield it's a Muslim man Green Party extremists Donald Trump in is a waste man that's the mayor of Sheffield he's a clown he's a fool he's born in Pakistan obviously hates America hates Trump I think I'm not gonna say he hates Sheffield but I will say he's transforming Sheffield he's gonna say I don't know much about Sheffield other than it was named of his a ship in the Falklands island that unfortunately was lost in that battle in the Falklands War rather I just look at this guy this is the United Kingdom Sadek can is the Mayor of London and this guy I think his name is Majid Majidi or something that is the mayor of Sheffield England you know if you look at the mayors in Sheffield going back centuries it's such a dignified British town and this clown show is the mayor today and that's that's the you that's the Trump derangement syndrome that's this merger of the alt left and the Muslim supremacist left that I'm talking about that is the United Kingdom that's the UK five library says I think he's Somali I think you're right I'm sorry I got their own wasteman yeah that's an insult okay let's just check the time as 1238 for those of you who are watching now who weren't watching before I have some news for you about Tommy Robinson you can find out the news at Tommy trial calm the news is that Tommy's appeal is no longer on July 24th is now being brought forward to July 18th so it's sooner that's good the second and really interesting piece of news to me is that the judge is no longer Lord Justice Brian Levison but rather Ian Burnett who is the Lord Chief justice for the entire UK the top judge would be like the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in United States and he's overseeing a panel of three judges he's one of three judges that's incredible to me a three-judge panel led by the Chief Justice the United Kingdom amazing is that not amazing I think that's amazing I'm in the third piece of news is that Tommy has asked me to go to the trial to cover it because Tommy believes and I think he's right on this that he will not get a fair hearing from the mainstream media it's obviously true I have a legal background myself I also know Tommy's legal background I've worked with him and his Canterbury contendere court case so I think that I'll be first of all fair to Tommy let's be honest the enemy Pro Tommy and second of all I understand a little bit of law a little bit about his own legal background so it is my goal to go there and provide as many reports as I can in video on Twitter by email whatever I'm guessing I'll probably have ten reports if you can help me crowd fund my way there I'd be grateful because it's not cheap buying a last-minute ticket to London if you can chip in a few bucks at Tommy trail call might be grateful that is a separate crowd fund from our save Tommy Java crowd fund which is 100% for Tommy's lawyers and his family so that's the news today let's go back to some of the other stories I I started off by mentioning NATO and we show you keeping it back up the kissing between Justin Trudeau is just accused credibly of groping a woman in Canada and there is that guy with the bald head and the beard I think that's the prime minister of Belgium and Trudeau just passes right by him and he goes in for the kiss kiss kiss kiss because you see a girl you kiss her isn't that more important than shaking the hand of the prime minister of Belgium I want to show you something else though a photo of the various first ladies of NATO so you have all these NATO bosses Donald to stay with melania Emmanuel macron is there with his wife whose name they've just momentarily forgotten of Brigitte where is Sophie Craig wire Trudeau you can see the lady with the hijab that's air diwan's wife to me it's outrageous that Turkey is even part of NATO you can see the the lady in the yellow dress I think that's the Belgian PM Brigitte macron is the third from the right I guess the fella bear I guess there's that's someone's husband let me let me read the caption First Lady Melania Tramp Trump and Frances first lady Brigitte micron Sweden prime minister supposed Lolo Flynn Belgian prime minister's partner Emily dear poder Greene I didn't say that right so those are the names there where's Sophie where's so President Donald Tusk s' wife why why is the EU why is the the EU president there I don't know where Sophie Trudeau remember when Melania Trump had surgery and so she was not doing public events for a couple he was serious surgery she she I think she was an inpatient in the hospital the media was obsessed with where's Milania and of course the trumped arrangement so she's run away from Donald Trump she's humiliated by old Trump they were they were giving in to their own fevered fantasies wasn't true of course she was just recovering from fairly serious surgery well what's Sophie Trudeau is she hiding from the public because of all this groping news that's my theory and it's not a baseless theory like the Melania deranged from syndrome because of course Sophie Trudeau has acknowledged in the past she has had tremendously stressful relations with her philandering husband I don't think it's really inappropriate to say that because it's so obviously true grant Guerin man ships in ten bucks it says greetings Ohayou are keeping us informed in a much-needed way well thanks very much and I did not foresee this whole thing but I remember when Tommy was arrested on May 25th I was watching him on Facebook live I can't by chance I was watching I don't know how that happened I guess it popped up on my feet and I saw take a look at this and I remember when he turned to the camera and he said George get a solicitor I know George we used to George used to work for us before George and I thought do they do they know how to do that I mean I'm a lawyer by training I know law I no longer practice law but we do a lot of lawyer in here we have a lot of lawyers we fight cases all the time when one of our reporters gets in trouble we hire a lawyer we crowdfunded that's that's our model so I thought okay I know what to do but I don't work with Tommy no more he's gone into pen and so what do we do so it took me a few weeks before I got permission from Tommy and his family to get engaged and I have not sought to be his spokesman in any wide-ranging way just on the narrow issue of crowd funding and the small facts appertaining thereto but Tommy has made this new request that I go to London and report on the trial I think that's right I think that's right because there are sympathetic people to Tommy who were citizen journalists in the UK you you probably know someone by name a lot of youtubers there's a great guy named red pill Phil you know I'm talking about he's great I even got pundits like Paul Joseph Watson my favorite YouTube commentator in the world who doesn't work for the rebel you've got you've got all you've even got count dank EULA right you know I'm talking about the guy who was convicted for saying mean things to his dog or whatever those are all good guys and gals but I mean I I I think that we have the combination of knowledge of the law knowledge of Tommy's case and we've got a good-sized audience I think we've just got to go there and tell the truth about this appeal because I just don't trust the BBC state broadcaster I don't trust the so-called private broadcasters in the UK I certainly don't trust the alt left media like vice or BuzzFeed they hate Tommy you'd think the tabloids that have a working-class audience would be fair to Tommy they're not it's really bizarre to me newspapers 90% of whom you know their readers would support Tommy they're hostile of Tommy I don't get it I don't get it I think we have to go there is what I'm saying you think anyone else is going to tell you what's accurately going on in that Court of Appeal if so I sure would like to know the name there's only one reporter that I would trust in the entire UK to treat Tommy right and his name is is an Andrew Neil of the BBC is a very very thoughtful guy who I think is secretly sympathetic to Tommy but he's more a a commentator he's not a reporter you got a couple of good guys from Breitbart absolutely let me not discount them you got some good guys at Breitbart I bet they'll send someone sorry I shouldn't have left them out Breitbart London's very good you got James telling Paul he got Doug Murray from Douglas Murray from The Spectator and Ellen pole from I think he writes for Breitbart but that's it folks that's it in that whole country so I think we got to go and cover it I see some more super chats Keith McIntosh Sophie's with her team serving the people cop ID the South says are you going live during the trial well I think I addressed that a little bit earlier and the answer is I will do whatever I can that the court permits so some courts don't let you live tweet you know what I mean like obviously I'm not going to be like I'm going to be sitting in the courtroom so obviously I'm not going to be talking noisily into a camera during that when there's a break when there's a you know lunch break or coffee breaking courts take those obviously I would step out and talk into the camera and then I would go back in so I would be giving intermittent updates like that at the end of the day I'll have several lengthy updates on what I want to do is tweet from my laptop just type type talk I'm a fast typist I think I could do a tweet like every two minutes or something like I would almost be transcribing what I heard but not all courts will I do that in Canada you need the permission of a court to do that I don't know how it is in the States I bet they're freer because they got the First Amendment I don't want to be in contempt of court I don't want someone to have to crowdfund my lawyer to get me out so I'm gonna have to get the permission of the judge it would be awful if I couldn't hopefully hopefully I'll be allowed to all right let's see what time it is so 49 we got 10 minutes left I showed you the first lady's and one first gents in NATO although we couldn't find Justin Trudeau's mrs. I wonder why I showed you that CBC Trump blimp love letter yeah I showed you Trudeau kissing the wife of the Belgian PM he does it a lot I'm gonna skip the other Trudeau stuff because it's oh it's on a whole different subject it's about NATO spending and we only have 10 minutes left what I'm going to do with your permission is I'm gonna I'm gonna read a bunch of comments cuz there's some really interesting comments I see they're going they're going by so why don't I do that for the rest of the time Jane Jay hey Ezra you packed your prison bag I didn't even know what a prison bag was until Tommy told me it's when when you're gonna be sentenced and there's a likelihood you're going to jail you bring your prison bag it's like your toothbrush and stuff like that it's it's what you're taking with you into prison it's called the prison bag I didn't even know about that Tammy says as well let's hope you can laughs what yeah for sure I want to do that goo goo II Burson Brit kangaroo court well I told you who the judges to do did you hear me go to go to tommy trial calm for the details on that I won't say him a third time but the absolute highest judge in the entire United Kingdom the Lord Chief Judge of the entire United King it's presiding over a three-judge panel I'm not gonna call that a kangaroo court sorry it's it's it I'm just not going to I think it's a serious judges panel any ward but please tell us what happened afterwards oh I'm gonna you're not gonna be able to shut me up I'm gonna I'm gonna talk before during at we're not doing before after in between whenever I can what that's the only reason I'm going there I don't have I don't have family in the UK I've already done the tourist thing there I'm just going for one reason only and that's just to report the hell out of this appeal don't you think that's the way to do it paladin Smith UK police don't go after Jews Ezra you'll be fine laugh-out-loud I don't know if that's true mmm I don't think it's a Jewish thing I think they would go after anyone who is a breaking the law which I do not intend to do or be breaking the political norms that's more and more the political policing there I have to say there's a chance that won't let me in the country right there's a chance they won't even let me in the country all right I hope it doesn't happen mmm no miracle chips in two bucks thank you for that yeah Peto says Ezra they will stop you from entering just like they did for Lauren southern well I hope they don't mm-hmm I don't think they would have any cause to do so and I think it would rather be outrageous if they did but we are in the land of outrage about rages don't you think wake up Ezra any fear you won't get into the UK yeah yeah absolutely I mean look they just blocked here drill ders through a trick as I described earlier they blocked Lauren southern Brittany Pettibone Martin Selmer now I missed anyone paladin Smith I reckon you'll be all right well sure hope so Liam Mick MC asked before you get your ticket yeah too late and you know you don't want to I don't think I would want to ask and what would I do anyways I would go anyways Kim Satan says good evening from England you were keeping a lot of us saying over here thank you for your support well if I'm keeping you sane that's that's a pretty bad state of affairs I'm joking around Diddy Cranfield welcome to the UK as well listen I've been in the UK plenty of times I've been as a tourist I've taken my family when is a kid but Tommy showed me a whole other side of the UK that part of me wishes I never knew I wished in my mind the UK was tourist stuff Buckingham Palace Millennium Eye or whether the big ferris wheel Trafalgar Square fancy gardens churchill shakespeare thatcher that's what the UK was to me until I met Tommy I've seen the dystopian side of the UK since I met Tommy true contrarian the seeds of right-wing growth are shown in the ripe decay of failed leftist policies Tommy is the catalyst for many to want rid of a political class to the shelter these grooming gangs for years well yeah and that's you know it's interesting and the delay on brexit I think is making things worse that's breaking down trust in the establishment it's interesting the Nigel Faraj is at least booting the idea of coming back nigel has not yet fully sunk his teeth into the Muslim grooming gang issue I think he's afraid of being marginalized as far-right I wish he would take on that issue as vigorously as Gerrard batten the current UK leader has paulus Matt Matt - Cedric us as we stay strong and fight the good fight god bless well I'll do my best thank you Gabriel Swift if they keep us in the EU I predict more than protests as the majority of us were waiting for us to leave so we could then turn our full attention to the sick audiology named Islam well that's what's gonna be interesting to me is our Brits passive or our Brits active Americans are active the proactive they're independent minded and I think part of it is because First Amendment SEC Amendment Constitution Brits have been disarmed and I think they've been bureaucratize they've been taught to think like they are Ward's of the state and I'm not insulting them this is not an insult I think it's I think Brits accept things from their government and it's a the drop if it's in the class system to know your place know your place know your place in in the social strata but know your places the state and there's you in America they had a revolution turn things around Canada's sort of halfway between the two would you agree mmm jo Shea says British media are no different than most Canadian media fake that's true Tammy says it's Tommy still in solitary confinement yes he is for his own safety the k-man we are actually free all right prove it any word the press is the problem here in England well that's why there are more than 900 police in the London Metropolitan Police alone who are on the Facebook beat you think I'm kidding I am not kidding there are 900 police in London who do nothing but sift through Facebook and Twitter and go after hate speech absolutely wake up rebel media says please where is the appeal taking place it's taking place at the Royal Courts of Justice the neighborhood is called temple or the Strand I don't know my neighbourhoods very well but that's where it is the Royal Courts of Justice Andre Nikitina says Tommy Robinson is an admitted Zionist yes he is out daft UK says England still lives in small villages I think you're right I think there is a that side of Britain is still traditional mush Morant do people get their money back if you were denied entry to the UK answer I very much don't think so no I could be wrong happy infidel Fox Pamela Geller Robert Spencer banned oh yes I forgot about them thank you yeah the Brits the banned people all the time copy the South the trial is another verse in the ballad about the lynching of Tommy Robinson yeah there's some Tommy songs out there I think there should be a great ballad though I'm just looking at some I'm just trying to find a comment that's not an inside comment referring to another comment Kym's I already read that one Jane Jay we are all Winston Smith right now well I know who you mean Winston Smith is the hero in the book 1984 by George Orwell I don't know the answer this question maybe you do do they even assign 90-94 to kids in school to read anymore I don't know I hope so you know I remember when I first went to China ten years ago maybe a dozen years ago now and I was so curious worried they wouldn't let me into China I flew in the Shanghai or Beijing I can't remember which Beijing and I had put journalists on my visa application and that was sort of a dumb idea I just wanted to be honest so they really grilled me and they finally let me in and one of the things I did in my first few days in Beijing was I went to bookstores and I saw what books I could find could I find on Liberty by John Stuart Mill yes could I find Animal Farm our in 1984 by George Orwell yes I tried typing in book titles that I thought would be subversive in the eyes of the communists now maybe this was in some fancy bookstore in Beijing but it wasn't just a Western book so most of the books for Chinese I was the only white guy in the store so this isn't this was not for expats I tried typing in the most provocative freedom oriented titles I could I couldn't find anything to trip the wire until I got on matters of religion Christianity falen Gong which is a Chinese sect or Chinese politics itself like Chairman Mao but I was actually surprised and my expectations were extremely low of what would be censored I'd say the uk's level of censorship is almost out of China's I know you're saying that's crazy that's crazy to say really I just told you that there are nine hundred police in London who arrest you for saying things on Facebook how's that different from China what's Tommy Robinson in prison for reporting outside a trial why seem solitary to punish him and I know you're saying that's rogue but how really how different is that from China now I can I could answer that I could tell you why it's different we think this is rogue as opposed to with China it's the rule and it would be odious to compare the UK and China but you tell me the direction the UK is going I tell you what's going in the direction of China's censorship folks is one o'clock on the nose if he wants more information about Tommy's new appeal go to Tommy trial calm if you want that free Tommy ringtone go to Tommy ringtone calm that's it for me it's one o'clock tune into my 8 p.m. Eastern show tonight until then on behalf of all of us here at rebel world headquarters goodbye and keep fighting for freedom you
