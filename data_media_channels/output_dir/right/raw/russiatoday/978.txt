France<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you think that France have</font>

getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better in every game so also the</font>

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,820
players they are getting more<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

30

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,320
unbelievable absolutely and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also we can</font>

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other players France</font>

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,470
has great would they say strength in

39
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,720
depth<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of strong players they could</font>

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,370
have picked maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> two teams actually</font>

41
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,400
France lots of good strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> players they</font>

42
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,320
have not conceded any goals in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,690
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few matches so their defense is the</font>

44
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,790
key<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's very solid</font>

45
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">defense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I played with butter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Real</font>

46
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Madrid so I can nominate him as the</font>

47
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,280
leader<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the defensive part of</font>

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,860
France of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course it's a system it's not</font>

49
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">just one player so the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

50
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,270
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend it's very good and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

51
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,720
have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pogba</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing a very</font>

52
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,600
good work up and he makes everything

53
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,430
easier for the defender as well

54
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a midfielder</font>

55
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relate to their</font>

56
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Croatia obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feigned very much for</font>

57
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,390
its midfield Luka Modric<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also even</font>

58
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">para such as an England fan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he did a lot</font>

59
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> damage England</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> didn t yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,220
this midfield from Croatia is one of the

61
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,010
key<font color="#E5E5E5"> points for them and so they are very</font>

62
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mature players</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look a</font>

63
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,890
moderate is leading this team in a very

64
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,400
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> way and so rocketed very seats</font>

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,830
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing good together</font>

66
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the midfield it's it's the king</font>

67
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,310
absolutely but Croatia they've played a

68
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,860
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra time three lots of extra</font>

69
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,470
time being English we know that's an

70
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,989
entire match more than France also

71
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">France had one day more s do you think</font>

72
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English media said it Croatia would</font>

73
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,730
be tired<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you think they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be time</font>

74
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,220
this is something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this some</font>

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,290
details that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

76
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put pepper for the game right but I</font>

77
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,280
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's gonna be a problem for</font>

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the creation because they they've been</font>

79
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,010
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great game three overtimes the</font>

80
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,640
last one against England was different

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,579
from from for them and they scored in

82
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,590
the overtime<font color="#E5E5E5"> different the other two</font>

83
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,959
that they finished with the PKS

84
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,230
and so I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one day and the</font>

85
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,840
overtime<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,769
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> their heart on the field and fight</font>

87
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,690
to to the end for this incredible

88
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,079
journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely which teams</font>

89
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,549
throughout the World Cup have surprised

90
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,680
you which players have surprised you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

91
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,709
team I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's Croatia I think before</font>

92
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the World</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cup a lot of people said that</font>

93
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">brush it could be the surprise and they</font>

94
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,379
just beat the expectations and they are

95
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,079
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the final and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the players I</font>

96
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,899
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm nominated in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BAP a big knows</font>

97
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,990
what he's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so far 19</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years old</font>

98
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the game seems that</font>

99
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,870
he's got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 35/36</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very mature and</font>

100
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,050
sometimes shows that he's just 19 so

101
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,930
it's very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are very</font>

102
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,970
blessed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a player like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this in the</font>

103
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,849
work of like this just 19 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> old yes</font>

104
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,949
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> pad and would you then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that he</font>

105
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,630
is a contender<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the Golden Ball do</font>

106
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,910
you think he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best players</font>

107
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah I think his season with PSG was</font>

108
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,430
normal but what she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing for the</font>

109
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,060
World Cup it's incredible and it's a

110
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,659
it's it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> count a lot when you</font>

111
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:06,919
think about Golden Ball and individual

112
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,340
awards the World Cup<font color="#E5E5E5"> counts a lot so we</font>

113
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">will see the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the final and but if</font>

114
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,240
France wins<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there will be</font>

115
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,660
one of the finalists for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individuals</font>

116
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">award so as we said it's France against</font>

117
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,479
Croatia<font color="#E5E5E5"> not Brazil as so many as so many</font>

118
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly people were predicting</font>

119
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,849
how do you think Brazil<font color="#CCCCCC"> has played at</font>

120
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tournament</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think Brazil played</font>

121
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,050
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good of course for us</font>

122
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brazilian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you know achieved the</font>

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,979
final or we<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you fail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but for me I</font>

124
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,720
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazil did everything that they</font>

125
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,050
could

126
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TT as a coach increases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the change to</font>

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,159
Brazil to<font color="#CCCCCC"> win the players was committed</font>

128
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,669
so I think Brazil<font color="#CCCCCC"> did a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tournament</font>

129
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,569
and in the against<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgium we watch it a</font>

130
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,389
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good game with the high level</font>

131
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">of technique tactics was unbelievable I</font>

132
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,729
think both<font color="#E5E5E5"> oates did a very good</font>

133
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">strategy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the end it's it's the game</font>

134
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,030
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iago Silva had a chance two minutes</font>

135
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,789
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that company had their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chances if</font>

231
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,029
so in Brazil was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same had a lot of</font>

232
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:38,570
doubts about Brazil and at the end 2014

233
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,540
unfortunate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us position was not so</font>

234
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,180
good but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people from Brazil was</font>

235
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,940
very good to host<font color="#E5E5E5"> a World Cup I think is</font>

236
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,389
the same for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diversion</font>

237
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,699
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I we were</font>

238
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,379
anticipating<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it was coming up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

239
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Russian World Cup it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was so he had</font>

240
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,569
Leo Messi Cristiano Ronaldo so that

241
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,879
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really happen did it quite simple</font>

242
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:06,049
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workup</font>

243
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:09,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave us a lot of lessons so how</font>

244
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,189
competitive is the game right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

245
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:13,619
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talent is just talent is not enough</font>

246
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:17,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore so a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things showed</font>

247
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:20,069
us how how important to to have this

248
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:23,610
group to a strong team but I still think

249
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,739
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christiano didn't believable with</font>

250
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:28,860
Portugal<font color="#CCCCCC"> he scored a lot of goals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Messi</font>

251
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,939
tried so so bad to put Argentina on the

252
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,970
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fortunately he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't but we</font>

253
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,779
saw other players shining and I think

254
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:40,920
this is the World Cup

255
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,929
absolutely do you think that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see</font>

256
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,299
either Messi or Ronaldo<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next</font>

257
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,649
World<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cup I mean because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their age</font>

258
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:49,139
maybe you do you think another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> below</font>

259
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,879
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> however here is like wine No</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

260
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,769
Ronaldo it will be 36 maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wish</font>

261
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,589
we can we can see him<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next World</font>

262
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,569
Cup<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well depends on his motivation</font>

263
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:05,759
but he's very strong on<font color="#CCCCCC"> his head</font>

264
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,019
he keeps his mind on targets on beat

265
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,410
records and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably and I wish this</font>

266
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">is more of my desire to to see him</font>

267
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,419
playing for for for to go another World

268
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,299
Cup<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think Messi it's probably we</font>

269
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,679
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> see he'll be 34 so I think Mexican</font>

270
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,459
can arrive in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shape and</font>

271
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,079
motivated for the another World Cup<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

272
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:31,799
Argentina

273
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,419
so maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one more than just one</font>

274
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,050
more possible yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

275
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,509

276
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,910
European teams do particularly well it

277
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,129
is in Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is often how it works</font>

279
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,079

280
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,449
come strong again or African teams or

281
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:53,569
Asian teams<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we have to take a</font>

282
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:58,610
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lessons also from the European</font>

283
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,759
teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe some tactics organizations</font>

284
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,929
and something that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring for the</font>
