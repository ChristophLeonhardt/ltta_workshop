1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
this book isn't airing out of a lot of
things but but you come across as less

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,030
guarded was is that is that hard for you
it doesn't feel good to do it it really

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,820
does Anderson I write in the book about
how you know for so much of my time in

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,890
public life I felt like I was on this
high wire with no net I was trying to

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,710
balance so many different competing
concerns and I wanted to write a book

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,740
that would be as candid take people
behind the scenes as I possibly could

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,090
share some of what went on on the road
the kinds of activities that you do when

8
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,530
you're running for president especially
as a woman but also to tackle the hard

9
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,190
questions like what what happened in the
campaign what were the mistakes I made

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,510
which I you know talked about and what
else happened and particularly with an

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,530
eye to understanding what we need to
know so it doesn't happen again one of

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,920
the things you write about is the
inauguration and I want to just take you

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,780
back to inauguration day you're standing
inside the Capitol waiting to go out on

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,260
the platform with the former president
with former President Clinton what was

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,640
going through your mind well it was such
a surreal moment because usually a

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,479
candidate who doesn't win the election
without some other position wouldn't go

17
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,180
but as a former first lady you know my
husband and I go to inaugurations it's

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,439
part of the way we demonstrate
continuity of government and I really

19
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,840
debated whether I could do it or not
and you actually called up to Jimmy

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,720
Carter former President Carter and
George W but right our offices were in

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,350
communication with both the Carters and
and both bushes and the elder bushes

22
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,570
couldn't come because of ill health but
you know both George and Laura and Jimmy

23
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,079
and Rosalyn we're gonna go and Bill and
I just said you know we got to do this

24
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,009
so we were going but I can't tell you I
was looking forward to it and as we were

25
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,750
standing inside the door of the Capitol
before you descend the steps to go out

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,149
to the platform you know I was just
thinking of what it was like when Bill

27
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,850
won and what it was like when I was
there in 2001 I was a newly elected

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,030
senator but Vice President Gore had lost
and coming back when President Obama was

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,599
inaugurated there were so many memories
running through you know my mind and I

30
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,930
did not know what to expect and I write
in the book about how really strange it

31
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,870
was to sit there and to listen to the
kind of speech that was so divisive the

32
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,569
rhetoric was hot I call it a cry from
the white nationalist gut instead of

33
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,099
taking the moment to say you know what I
want to reach out and be the president

34
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,190
for everybody you know he didn't win the
popular vote he squeaked through in the

35
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,840
electoral college he had a chance to
really begin to fill the role and that

36
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,640
didn't happen that day I talked about
American carnage when you were saying

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,430
the steps you write in the book that you
were wishing you were anywhere else but

38
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,750
there anywhere else Bali maybe you know
anywhere else

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,060
gret not going to Bali no I look I am
afflicted with the responsibility gene I

40
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,580
did the right thing I knew I had to go
but I have to quickly add that the next

41
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,220
day was great you know the women's March
filled with enthusiasm and nearly 5

42
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,599
million people biggest ever in our
history it really lifted my spirits you

43
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,300
also write in the book that George W
Bush reportedly said after after the

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,950
inauguration that was some weird shit
yes and I told I said I couldn't have

45
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,950
agreed more you agree with that sense
right I do it was so strange I mean we

46
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,709
reveal your sourcing on that is she
sitting across from me right now well no

47
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,769
I phrased it very delicately you know it
was I went to the lunch afterwards I

48
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,159
mean I did everything that you're
supposed to do I went to the lunch you

49
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,040
also said you defend a lot of time on
the platform avoiding eye contact with

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,420
people who had been cruel to you yeah
well that terrible thing yes I mean I I

51
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,750
was obviously aware that there were a
lot of people there who had said

52
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,340
terrible things about me you know I
could hear some Locker up chants in the

53
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,629
distance and then on the way out I ran
into one of the you know people in the

54
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:18,149
Congress who've been pursuing me I
didn't recognize him to be and you

55
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,508
thought jason Chaffetz was right yes I
was leaving the platform and you know

56
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,960
this gentleman stuck out his hand and
you know I greeted him and I thought it

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,650
was Reince Priebus he tweeted out a
photo in fact and he said I want to get

58
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,580
it right tweeted out a picture saying so
please she is not the president yeah and

59
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,319
I said I would have liked to have said
yeah and I thought you were Reince

60
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,330
Priebus but anyway it you cover wannabe
job there I did call him I want to be

61
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,219
famous fan I am a huge limb is fan who
isn't that a thing that's ever seen it

62
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:50,759
or heard the music does that happen to
you a lot I mean people coming up to you

63
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,620
who have said terrible things about you
not to your face and then being very

64
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,430
friendly to your face I mean after the
luncheon a congressman came up to you

65
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,250
that's right who had called you I think
the Antichrist did called me the

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,659
Antichrist and came up to introduce his
wife to me I'd never met him before he's

67
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:11,909
now our interior secretary as I write in
the book and he could not have been

68
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:16,919
nicer in coming up to say hello wanting
to greet me and I said well you know

69
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,169
congressman I'm not the Antichrist and
he immediately backpedaled and oh my

70
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,490
goodness and and his wife could not have
been nicer but I make the point that

71
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,669
when you are subjected to the kind of
abuse that we see much too much of in

72
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,319
our politics right now both in person
and online and people feel very free

73
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,580
anonymously to say terrible things or
from a long distance where they don't

74
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,360
have to look you in the eye they don't
have to relate to you or try to figure

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,389
out you know where you stand on
something why you believe what you

76
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,610
believe and it's a real loss it's a loss
I mean this hyper partisanship and this

77
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,949
negativity that I think has been really
inflamed by the internet I've given a

78
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,389
lot of thought to it over the last
month's you also have a lot of people

79
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,349
since then since inauguration day in the
last eight months coming up to you women

80
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,949
coming up to you with their daughters
and saying my daughter didn't go out to

81
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,250
vote and sort of wanting absolution from
right

82
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,889
that happened to me what's more common
are people bursting into tears welling

83
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,270
up I had a lot of that at my book
signing yesterday here do you give

84
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:30,769
absolution to those who didn't vote to
women who didn't know I don't I look I

85
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,009
when it first started happening it was
so soon after the election and the

86
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:39,129
election was so
bizarre and close it was hard for me to

87
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:44,289
you know comfort somebody who was coming
to me and saying oh I wish I'd done more

88
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:48,789
or I'm sorry I didn't vote because I
think this was one of the most

89
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,110
consequential elections that you know we
have faced in a long time so no

90
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,110
absolution but of course you know I just
hope people will take what happened this

91
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,310
time seriously and be ready and willing
to vote the next time it seems like

92
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,500
you've been doing a lot of yoga
alternate nostril breathing well I tried

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,759
that page 27 in your book you talked
about alternate nostril breathing yes

94
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,439
what is that and dare you give me a
demonstration well I would highly

95
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,419
recommend it
you know I mean you're supposed to shut

96
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,599
your eyes I don't want to shut your ass
up my eyes on you know on national

97
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,490
television but you know you do hold and
you breathe through one and you hold it

98
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,669
and then you exhale through the other
and you keep going

99
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:34,990
I can only say based on my personal
experience that if you're sitting

100
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,909
cross-legged on the yoga mat and you're
doing it and you're really trying to

101
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:46,479
inhale and hold it and then have a long
exhale it is very relaxing so I don't if

102
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,839
you can do it in the middle of hurricane
coverage but maybe some other moments

103
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,509
you can try it I found it quite helpful
I want to talk to you about Jim coming

104
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:01,360
when when Comey said that he was
reopening the investigation you believe

105
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,659
that is the day that effectively your
campaign was over well that you lost I

106
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:12,969
believe based on a lot of evidence and a
lot of assessments by other good

107
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:18,370
analysts Nate Silver being one that yes
that was the determinate of day because

108
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,689
it stopped my momentum I don't blame
voters for wondering what the heck was

109
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:29,289
going on you have the FBI director
saying what he said and it was a you

110
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:36,219
know terrible time to try to break
through the last days of a campaign when

111
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,529
you had this hanging over my head and it
wasn't really lifted until the Sunday

112
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:46,449
before the election and you had people
early voting believing that oh my gosh

113
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,000
there really is something here I knew
there wasn't and I

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,890
that it was hard to understand why he
didn't just call me and others up and

115
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,910
say hey can we look at this you feel you
had been making progress winning back

116
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,940
white women voters
I believe well I'll give you one quick

117
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,130
example that I write about not my
polling but other polling I was leading

118
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,110
about 25 26 points in the Philadelphia
suburbs that could not have happened if

119
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,350
I hadn't had a lot of women and a lot of
Republican women independent women

120
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,340
saying that they were going to vote for
me telling pollsters that I won those

121
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,590
suburbs by 13 points that's a huge loss
and I needed to win by probably about

122
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,610
eighteen to counterbalance what happens
in the rest of the state which is

123
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,960
something that we all knew going in but
you know I talk about this in the book

124
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,400
because I do want to answer questions
that people might have but what I think

125
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:46,120
is important is to really take a candid
hard look about you know what the

126
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,680
factors were I hope nobody ever faces
what I faced with respect to that but

127
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,010
whoever runs again probably starting in
2018 will face Russian interference may

128
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,920
face coordination between opposition
campaigns and Russians will face voter

129
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,010
suppression will face endemic sexism and
misogyny and part of why I wrote this

130
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,990
book was not only to come to grips with
what I think happened but to send up

131
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,220
some you know alarm signals so that
others can say hey wait a minute these

132
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,089
factors could affect anybody and
eventually Republicans could be affected

133
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,839
some of your critics when they hear you
talk about misogyny they say they roll

134
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,020
their eyes and say look that's that's an
excuse

135
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,900
that in this day and age we had an
african-american president but there's a

136
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,220
big difference between what motivates
voters on race and what doesn't motivate

137
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,310
voters on gender most people in my
position who have run for office

138
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,600
particularly at the state level for
senator governor and certainly my

139
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,050
experience is running for president you
don't like to raise this because you

140
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,310
don't want people to think hey you know
you're making excuses but I decided to

141
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,030
raise it I write a whole chapter about
it because I think if we don't confront

142
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,950
it especially given the
words and actions of our current

143
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:10,250
president it could be a big backlash
that will undermine a lot of young women

144
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,149
and their own futures and now we know
it's not just in politics it's in

145
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,110
Silicon Valley it's in businesses
evolved Sheryl Sandberg good yes you

146
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,709
believe that there's a double standard
that women who when when you were

147
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:27,139
Secretary of State and you were seen as
working for somebody else's interests

148
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:32,000
the United States interests you were
very popular poll showed you were not

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,680
69% at the end of my tenure but that
when you were seen as working for

150
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,639
yourself as a candidate mm-hm
there's a different viewpoint and

151
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,440
Anderson it's not just what I believe as
you mentioned Sheryl Sandberg who's just

152
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,570
delved into all the research that we
possibly have about these issues when a

153
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,639
man is professionally successful he is
seen as more likeable as a woman becomes

154
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,079
more professionally successful she is
seen as less likeable as you point out

155
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,399
when a woman advocates for someone else
in my position as Secretary of State for

156
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,089
my country for the president I was
serving you know people can really like

157
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,110
you like the job you're doing I'm the
exact same person and then all of a

158
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:18,260
sudden I step into the arena it's true
even with something as mundane as if a

159
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,300
woman goes to the to her employer and
advocates a raise for someone else she's

160
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,490
seen as a great team player leadership
and all the rest if she goes and

161
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,690
advocates for herself it counts against
her whereas if a man goes and advocates

162
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,899
for himself
hey you know the guy's got guts he's

163
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,040
willing to step up and ask for what he
wants you said about Jim Comey that he

164
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,899
shaved you yeah which is a very I mean
that's a strong word it is a strongly

165
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,870
and it also implies that this was a
personal or that he was trying to get

166
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,550
you he's never been clear about his
motivation and what bothered me the most

167
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:02,930
as the time went on after the election
is and we learned more about the open

168
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,269
FBI investigation into the Trump
campaign and their connections with

169
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,560
Russia that had been going on for quite
some time the American people didn't

170
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,180
know about it he was specifically
asked why didn't you tell the American

171
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,980
people about that investigation and he
said well because it was too close to an

172
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,850
election so ask yourself a closed
investigation that ended the prior July

173
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,690
an ongoing investigation into the Trump
campaign and Russia one deserves to be

174
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,430
blown out of all proportion nothing to
be found one more time and the American

175
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,170
people don't have the information that
there's a legitimate investigation going

176
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,790
on about Trump and Russia before they
vote do you think it is personal I have

177
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,960
no idea I can't sit here and tell you I
know that there had to be some pressure

178
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,880
on him because Rudy Giuliani announced
two days before that letter came out

179
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,670
that something big was coming in two
days and people have speculated was he

180
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,350
under pressure from Giuliani and others
within the FBI or the broader

181
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,410
law-enforcement community
I don't speculate on it I just talked

182
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,620
about how really hard to understand it
was and the impact that it had one of

183
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,430
the things though that director Comey
gave for that press conference in July

184
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,260
was the meeting that your husband had on
the tarmac with the Attorney General

185
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,160
attorney general Lynch you write about
it in the book but what you don't

186
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,330
mention in the book is what you said to
your husband when you heard about that

187
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,740
meeting I didn't hear about it for days
because it was so inconsequential to

188
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,820
both of them and then when I heard about
it I didn't really think much of it and

189
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:51,110
I think this was a rationalization that
was used for being able to do what he

190
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,600
did but you know what's important to me
going forward is as I say I think it's

191
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,070
important to focus on what happened
because lessons can be learned but the

192
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,970
more important lessons that will affect
our democracy going forward or not about

193
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,340
him and his investigation he I think
forever changed history but that's in

194
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,140
the past what's important is the fact
that the Russians are still going at us

195
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,600
he himself admitted that before Congress
people I really respect like Jim clapper

196
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,110
and John Brennan and others who knew
what the Russians were doing have been

197
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,590
sounding the alarm I will tell you this
Anderson if

198
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,180
I had been elected president under the
same circumstances so that you know I

199
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,900
lost the popular vote I squeaked through
the electoral college and evidence came

200
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,320
up that the Russians for whatever reason
were trying to help me I would have said

201
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,580
on the first day in office we're gonna
launch the most thorough investigation

202
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,860
no nation particularly an adversary
nation can mess with our democracy I

203
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,340
would have had an independent commission
I would have done everything I could to

204
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,480
get to the bottom of it because it's not
going to stop that's what I'm worried

205
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,260
about in the USA today when asked about
collusion between the Trump campaign and

206
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,040
Russia you said quote I'm convinced of
it so I just want to be clear you're

207
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,330
convinced there was collusion well let
me say if I'm convinced there was

208
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:14,180
communication I'm convinced there were
meetings and phone calls I'm convinced

209
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,830
that there were financial entanglements
let's let's wait to see what it's called

210
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm convinced that there was something
going on and let's put that though let's

211
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,070
put the investigation to one side
because indeed I have a lot of

212
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,520
confidence in the Special Counsel I
don't know what he's going to end up

213
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
with he's a very honorable man if
there's nothing there there's nothing

214
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,940
there if there is I think he'll tell us
put that to one side because that's

215
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,850
ongoing it almost doesn't matter
our president whoever our president is

216
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,950
should be defending our country and
should be standing up and saying nobody

217
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,750
messes with America we are not going to
tolerate that we don't hear any of that

218
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,870
coming from the White House because of
Russia's role do you think there should

219
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,390
be an asterisk next to President Trump's
name in the history books look I don't

220
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,839
know we don't know we don't have all the
facts yet what I believe we now know

221
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,599
they paid for facebook ads and those
were disseminated broadly we know that

222
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,579
they had access to targeting and data
information from somewhere maybe

223
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:24,679
internally maybe helped externally we
know that they had Russians pretending

224
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,500
to be Americans who were online and
in-person trying to foment negative

225
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,360
stories about me and positive ones about
Trump we know there was a huge amount of

226
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,190
content being produced in places like
Macedonia we know that WikiLeaks which

227
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,200
is basically
a front now for Putin was more than

228
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,050
willing to publish stolen emails from
the DNC from John Podesta and that then

229
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,090
those emails were weaponized with
ridiculous absurd untrue stories being

230
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,500
churned out on and on so there's a lot
we know already your fuck you follow

231
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,430
this extremely closely what I started
following this back in the summer of

232
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:11,210
2016 because there was something going
on when the DNC hack happened you know

233
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:18,140
we had a huge political crisis when
Republicans physically broke in to the

234
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,700
Democratic Party's records back in the
so-called watergate years this is a

235
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,930
different kind of theft and it's do you
think this is bigger than Watergate I

236
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,210
think it's probably bigger than
Watergate because it is about the future

237
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:39,140
you know we no longer are worried about
you know spies and provocateurs with you

238
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,360
know dressed in black with gloves
breaking into a an office and stealing

239
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,070
information they do it sitting in the
offices of the Russian you know military

240
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,110
intelligence and other related venues
and they get into what is the core of

241
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,360
our life now through the computer
network as you know though Republicans

242
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,570
will say no vote was ever changed this
did not affect the outcome well I would

243
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,220
say two things this was a highly
sophisticated influence operation I

244
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,880
believe it did affect people's votes you
think it cost you votes I think it cost

245
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,750
me votes the fact that those emails were
were don't those were they well and that

246
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,310
they were were weaponized so in the book
I write about how if you go look at

247
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:27,500
Google searches particularly in some of
the battleground states during October

248
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,540
and you listen to Trump's speeches where
he mentioned WikiLeaks I think 160 times

249
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:41,120
they clearly knew that stories that were
making stuff up trying to use the emails

250
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,820
were permeating Facebook and other sites
the worst of them was this pizza gate

251
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,460
story where honest to goodness out of
whole cloth made up they took the word

252
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,870
pizza out of one of John Podesta Z mails
and

253
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,470
that he and I were running a child
trafficking ring in a poor little pizza

254
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:03,000
parlor in Washington
it sounds absurd millions of people were

255
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,080
exposed to that the horrible hit job
total lies about the Clinton Foundation

256
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,340
people were affected by that because we
could see that the wikileaks searches in

257
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,920
a lot of places that were historically
kind of swing counties were really

258
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,840
rising i think the influence did affect
individual voters what we don't know yet

259
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,929
and we are only beginning to get
evidence of is why were the russians

260
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,380
intruding into our voter registration
rolls but do you think this Russian

261
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,440
interference was not enough to have cost
the election if director Comey hadn't

262
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,110
reopened that investigation that's what
I believe I believe though it became a

263
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,179
perfect storm reopening it which caused
people once again to be obsessed with

264
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:53,280
emails and then Podesta's emails being
used to drive all this negative story

265
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,800
about me I think it came together to
really kind of make some people queasy

266
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,850
like oh my gosh what if she goes to jail
I heard that so many times I've talked

267
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,440
to reporters who were out there covering
the campaign to the very end and people

268
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,140
would say things like you know I like
her and I think she's done a good job

269
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,760
but what if she's in jail and you know I
knew that that was happening but I

270
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,750
thought we would ride it out I want to
ask you about the second debate

271
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,960
yeah which took place two days and you
were there and I want to thank you I

272
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,950
want to thank you Anderson I'm hard on
the press as you know from reading the

273
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,960
book in many ways but a couple of people
come in for you know good descriptions

274
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,160
and praise and I thought the way you
started that debate what you said in the

275
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,730
beginning needed to be said and I I
really appreciated that well what you're

276
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,250
referencing is is my first question to
President Trump which was you know

277
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,010
describing what he had talked about he
described as lack or inventor and I said

278
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:52,140
that is sexual assault or do you do you
understand that we wrestled as a

279
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,110
co-moderator we wrestled with how to
handle the access hollywood tape i'm

280
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,160
wondering when the access hollywood tape
came out two days before this debate did

281
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,240
you wrestle with what to say about it
well first of all we were shocked and

282
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,100
and we were you know totally
surprised that something like that

283
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:16,680
existed and that had come out and we did
wrestle with it because we wanted to let

284
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,770
people see it we didn't want to get in
the way of people being able to draw

285
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,600
their own conclusions but we also you
know wanted to you know reference it

286
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,390
because I found it very troubling both
personally and politically do you

287
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,680
understand women who voted for Donald
Trump as president even though they

288
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,590
heard what he said on the accident do
you respect women who voted for Donald

289
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,390
Trump after the accident here's what I
would say about that I think what

290
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:52,260
happened after that tape which was
wall-to-wall coverage certainly affected

291
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,000
a lot of people and I think a lot of
women were very concerned about that and

292
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,520
I knew that it would be tough to I won
women I won all women but I lost white

293
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,210
women and I knew that would be tough but
I ended up actually getting more white

294
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,290
women's votes than President Obama had
in 2012 so this is not just a problem

295
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,750
for me this was a longer term Democratic
nominee problem so I knew I was going to

296
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,840
have to work hard on it and when that
happened and the way really it was a

297
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,340
horrific two to three days story and
then it sort of dropped because remember

298
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,850
within an hour of that tape going public
release WikiLeaks dropped John Podesta Z

299
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:37,980
mails I struggled with that I thought
why would somebody find what largely I

300
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,960
think could be described as boring
anodyne emails more significant than

301
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,830
words coming out of trumps mouth also at
that debate there was there it was the

302
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,460
most tense room I've ever been in for
the first 30 minutes certainly at the

303
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,910
debate you didn't shake hands with each
other and there was the physicality of

304
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,880
Donald Trump walking around the stage
I'm just wondering what was going

305
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,260
through your mind at that point well as
I write you know I prepared for him to

306
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,970
try to use his size and his presence to
intimidate me as I was walking out to

307
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,120
get on the debate that's something you
would actually press I had practiced and

308
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,210
you know one of the members of my team
said

309
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,480
remember he's trying to get inside your
head I said yeah you think because I

310
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,440
knew that the best way he could respond
given what that tape showed was to try

311
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,190
to assert you know the the the alpha
male

312
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,980
it's just locker room talk stuff so we
we practiced that and I concluded after

313
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,820
practicing it that I needed to just
remain calm and composed because if I

314
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,960
said anything that acknowledged it I was
afraid that it would look like I

315
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,250
couldn't take it that I wasn't you know
really tough enough that this guy was

316
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,630
looming over me I should just be able to
proceed that's what I did

317
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,890
in retrospect in writing the book I
thought you know because my head was

318
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:11,280
like running all through the debate like
this is really discomforting this is

319
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,460
weird I've debated other people what
he's doing is deliberately meant to

320
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,120
throw me off maybe I should say
something you know I turn around you're

321
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,950
not going to intimidate me back off you
creep but I concluded no I wanted to

322
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,810
remain composed you know it was judged I
was attracting for you it was obviously

323
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,630
you weren't looking at him no did you
see him out of the corner your eyes you

324
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,040
could I mean you could feel the presence
and you know maybe it's a skill that

325
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,800
women particularly develop because you
know we have to be aware of our

326
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,850
surroundings I certainly was aware of
him and and you know I won the debate

327
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:50,660
according to the analysts and all the
rest of that but as I say in the book I

328
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:57,090
think that what he did and what he tried
to do and his insulting me like calling

329
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,720
me a nasty woman in the third debate all
of that played to his base so both the

330
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,190
men and women who were in his base in
the Republican base

331
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,360
they were rationalizing their support
for him all the time it was like well

332
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,230
yeah it's probably his locker room oh my
gosh you know look the director of the

333
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,740
FBI says she may go to jail okay well
locker room isn't as bad as that so

334
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,780
there was a constant weighing back and
forth and at the end he got 90% of the

335
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,480
Republican vote I got 90% of the
Democratic vote and it was in part

336
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,660
because I think a lot of people who
voted for him well he won't really be

337
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,410
like that as president
and besides we want our tax cuts and we

338
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,850
want to make sure that we get a Supreme
Court justice so I think there was heavy

339
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,780
rationalization going on in that last
month you spent a lot of time in the

340
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,840
book talking about how much comfort your
husband gave you throughout the campaign

341
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,020
and yeah and obvious in the last couple
of months you wrote I know some people

342
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,440
wonder why we're still together that we
must have an arrangement we do it's

343
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,650
called a marriage that I helped him
become president and then stayed so he

344
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,580
could help me become president know that
we lead completely separate lives and

345
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,090
it's just a marriage on paper now he's
reading over my shoulder in our kitchen

346
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,600
with our dogs underfoot I wonder why you
felt the need to include that in the

347
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,560
book you know I talked about Bill I
talked about Chelsea and I talked about

348
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:19,200
my mother and I talked about my friends
because in the book on second in the

349
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,440
book I have a chapter called on being a
woman in politics where I really do try

350
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,140
to take on sexism and misogyny but I
also wanted to make it clear first of

351
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,790
all that putting yourself out there in
politics in public life can be immensely

352
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:37,500
rewarding but that's not all that's
important in life by any means and so I

353
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:45,900
wanted to you really again kind of pull
the curtain back and say you know I lost

354
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,290
a presidential campaign that I thought I
was going to win it was devastating but

355
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:57,030
I have so many blessings in my life
starting with my husband and the life we

356
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,450
built together you also wrote that
during the what you describe as the dark

357
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,050
days of your marriage the two questions
you asked herself was do I still love

358
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,320
him and can i still be in this marriage
without becoming unrecognizable to

359
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,130
myself were those easy questions to
answer they were really hard questions

360
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:18,150
you know anybody alive in America at
that time knows how difficult that

361
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:26,550
period was and you know I I really had
to struggle and I had a lot of angst you

362
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:32,250
know I had to fall back on my faith and
my family my friends but I wasn't going

363
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,490
to be making a decision that other
people wanted me to make or that public

364
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,360
pressure was you know coming in on me
I'm gonna make my decision and it was

365
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,070
based on those two questions and you
know the life we had built together and

366
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,450
I'm very glad that that's the way I
chose to continue my life Chelsea

367
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,870
wynton was a surrogate during before you
during the campaign Ivanka Trump was a

368
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,660
surrogate for for president Trump if you
had won with Chelsea Clinton have an

369
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,810
office in the West Wing would she be
able to drop in on meetings with

370
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,680
congressional leaders no but it wouldn't
even cross her mind she's got a very

371
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,980
active life she's written a couple of
great books and is it appropriate you

372
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,290
know it's up to a president decide who
is or is not welcomed in any meeting

373
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:22,020
that's up to a president and I you know
can only speak for myself and the White

374
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,540
House has I've been in and the work that
I've done and I think there's not enough

375
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,700
expertise and experience yet in the
White House right now I think does it

376
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,730
concern you that Jared Kushner was
somebody you worked as Secretary of

377
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,180
State who worked obviously on Middle
East peace does it concern that Jared

378
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,700
Kushner is seems to be the point person
on well it concerns me that the deep

379
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,520
well of experience and expertise that
our country has to offer our foreign

380
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,380
service has to offer that outside
experts have to offer is largely being

381
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,030
disregarded and you know if you look at
what's happening in North Korea we need

382
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,690
to have an intensive diplomatic effort
that requires people who know the

383
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,440
culture know the history know the
languages that are involved I don't see

384
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,920
that happening and then you can pick
anywhere else in the world and draw the

385
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,910
same conclusion so we are not engaging
in statecraft the way we need to it's

386
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,050
not that individuals can't be part of
teams who may have different expertise

387
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:27,000
or perspectives that's fine but teams
need to be led by people who understand

388
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,010
the history and how we got to where we
are in order to make progress in the

389
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,210
book you make no attempt to hide your
displeasure about the electoral college

390
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,890
and you say on page 386 you say the
godforsaken Elektro you mentioned

391
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,860
winning the popular vote obviously
multiple times in the book yes do you

392
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,910
think the electoral college should be
abolished I said that in 2000 after what

393
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,650
happened to the 2000 election with Al
Gore I was elected to the Senate that

394
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:59,310
same year and if you look at our recent
history we've had several candidates

395
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,720
nominees who have won the popular vote
and lost the electoral college what does

396
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,020
that say and it says that an anachronism
that was designed for another time no

397
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,300
longer works if we've moved toward
one-person one-vote that's how we select

398
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,860
winners I was amused after the French
elections when I was listening to an

399
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,400
interview with a French electoral expert
and he said well unlike your country the

400
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,280
person who wins the most votes wins so I
think it needs to be eliminated I'd like

401
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,970
to see us move beyond it yes
the you also mentioned in the book that

402
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,690
after you realize you'd lost you thought
about all the locker option

403
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,380
yes and that Donald Trump had said it
actually was at the second debate Donald

404
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,950
Trump said he if he was president you
would be in jail is that something you

405
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,870
seriously worried about well I knew I
had no reason to worry about it but I

406
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,190
worried that he might make that effort
you can't predict what he might do

407
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,720
that's one of the lessons I think we've
seen so far in this presidency but you

408
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,920
know I like so much else I just kind of
moved beyond that I got interested in

409
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,280
cleaning my closets and you know taking
long walks in the woods things that

410
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,500
helped me recover from that loss do you
think Donald Trump has moved beyond the

411
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,130
election are you I mean he does talk
about you still or not a lot yes he does

412
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,480
talk about me quite a bit I don't know I
would think he'd have a lot more

413
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,300
important things to spend his time on
he's got you know crises all around the

414
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,860
world to deal with he's got divisive
nough sin our country he's got the

415
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,850
terrible events of Charlottesville and
so much else going on that I think he

416
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,350
should be focused on rather than
constantly trying to take potshots at me

417
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,980
or at President Obama he does that quite
often too just a couple quick other

418
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,000
questions senator Sanders obviously he
has a strong voice now and the

419
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,210
Democratic Party comes under a lot of
criticism from you in the book what

420
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,310
political sin did he commit other than
choosing to run against you well it's

421
00:32:53,310 --> 00:33:00,840
not the political sin he committed it
was the failure to move quickly to unify

422
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,080
the party and his supporters and I know
a little bit about this after it was

423
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,400
clear that yes it was clear I was going
to be the nominee like in March or April

424
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,680
it was beyond any doubt in June
and in a way we ran a much closer

425
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:22,590
tougher primary contest between
President Obama and myself it was really

426
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:29,550
close and I immediately endorsed him and
I went to work for him I spent countless

427
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:34,860
hours Anderson convincing my supporters
who felt equally aggrieved that they had

428
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,240
to support Barack Obama I was still
arguing with big rooms of supporters at

429
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,010
the Denver convention I didn't get that
same you know respect and reciprocity

430
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,940
from senator Sanders or from his
supporters they're still you know

431
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,630
incredibly divisive and I'm interested
in what he can do to help elect

432
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,010
Democrats he's not a Democrat he he
makes that clear but we need to do

433
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,120
everything possible to win the
governorships in New Jersey and Virginia

434
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,820
this year and we need to do everything
possible to flip the Congress in 2018 he

435
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,770
could be helpful if he so chose and
that's what I'm calling on him to do do

436
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,550
you think Donald Trump will be a
candidate in 2020 well he's already got

437
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,440
a committee open he's raising a lot of
money so I think he thinks he will be

438
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,540
and we'll have to wait and see what
happens to those who hear you they you

439
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,219
know hear interviews you've done see the
book coming out and think is this really

440
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,869
what the Democratic Party needs that
there's do that they need fresh

441
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,440
leadership they need new voices they
need new people entering the arena and

442
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,540
that by you being on the stage in such a
public way it it hampers that oh I don't

443
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,340
buy that at all I think you know from my
perspective I have a lot of experience

444
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,800
and expertise and insight that I'm
sharing with the world and particularly

445
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,250
with Democrats I've got a new
organization called onward together I'm

446
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,630
supporting young grassroots groups that
have sprung up to recruit candidates

447
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:06,000
train them run them fund them I'm going
to be supporting candidates so I may be

448
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,010
out of politics as a candidate but I am
still deeply committed to doing anything

449
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:17,700
I can to make sure that we don't lose
ground to this divisive bigotry and bias

450
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,590
and Prejudice and and you know favoring
the the wealthy and the well-connected

451
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,490
over everybody else that I see as the
agenda of this White House

452
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:30,750
General Michael Hayden I have him on my
show a lot and you know he has a

453
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,859
lifetime in intelligence work one of the
things he talks about is the thin veneer

454
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:39,660
of civilization and that he is very
concerned that it is a very thin veneer

455
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,580
that we think our institutions are so
solid that our democracy is so secure

456
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,970
that nothing can upset and nothing can
wipe away that thin veneer of

457
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,220
civilization do you worry about that I
worry about it all the time I've heard

458
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:57,270
Mike Hayden talked to you about that
and I know he's written about it and

459
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:05,060
it's a very serious sober warning you
know civilization in part is the

460
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,140
institutionalization of the rule of law
of minority rights of a free press of

461
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,869
the kinds of incredible guarantees that
we made as a nation from our very

462
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:22,500
founding civilization also requires
leadership so that when people start

463
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,890
engaging in white supremacy talk and
they parade as neo-nazis and they are in

464
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,420
the Ku Klux Klan and and they are
unbridled on the internet with their

465
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:39,390
racist and sexist and other kinds of
insulting comments we need leadership at

466
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,349
the highest levels of our government to
say that's not acceptable part of what

467
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:48,690
makes us this dynamic extraordinary
country which I'm very optimistic about

468
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,849
long-term is our diversity is the fact
that we've brought people together from

469
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:58,880
all over to be part of the American
Dream in the American experiment so our

470
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:06,260
civilization which has the attributes of
the kind of institutional supports and

471
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:13,170
democracy and citizenship and voting
being absolutely core to that has to be

472
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,089
defended internally and externally and
I'm just hoping that more people and

473
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:23,250
particularly more Republicans will speak
up because if we begin to see the

474
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:28,410
erosion of the rule of law and the
erosion of our our voting system and so

475
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,369
much else that's not going to stop by
hurting Democrats for heaven's sakes

476
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:37,109
that hurts our entire country and
undermines who we are as Americans so I

477
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:41,640
think that people like Mike Hayden and
as many others as possible need to be

478
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,660
speaking out and standing up and saying
just that Secretary Clinton thanks very

479
00:37:45,660 --> 00:00:00,000
much thanks
