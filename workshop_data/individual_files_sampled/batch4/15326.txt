I read today that four men had been stabbed in London over a five-day period so far and the last one was a man who was killed in broad daylight I mean this is a really brutal situation you know you nobody would have thought the 21st century London would have violence on this scale but as we know it's part and parcel of living in a big city there's an article here in RT that says London's night crime numbers continue to saw as four men was stabbed in a five-day frenzy of violence the latest victim of London's violent crime epidemic died last night stabbed in broad daylight in North London the man understood to be in his 20s was stabbed in Islington on Monday emergency crews by the way Islington being jeremy corbyn's neck of the woods emergency crews were called to the scene at upper street but the stabbed victim died at the scene Scotland Yard confirmed so there was three other men that were stabbed aged 20 24 and 28 these are young lads on the murder tours it says here is more than 65 now there is a common theme here it tends to be young people but most of all the victims tend to be young black boys and it's it's quite obvious why this is a gang problem and it's interesting that there's a story here in The Daily Star London gangs using stabbing point system to boast about attacks as bloodbath continues so the source is obvious here I mean it's quite obvious based on the victims and based on where it's happening this is postcode wars it's gang violence and it's interesting this article here London gangs are using a point system to boast about the number of people they have stabbed in the ongoing turf war now this is coming from a guy called Chris Freddy who was awarded an OBE in 2012 for his youth work and he revealed the motivation behind youngsters stabbing each other and in the article he said there's actually a point system that the young people are following if you stab someone you get a point if you're in a gang and stabbed two people and somebody stabs nobody then there's peer pressure to go out there and get yourself on the scoresheet Chris was told about the system by a 16 year old boy who said he was at the top of the table after stabbing six people and he doesn't even know if he's killed them honor a 16 year old boy going out stabbing people I mean if it goes hand-in-hand with the acid attack violence it tends to be gang violence this is not just warfare but a point system almost a game and this is what happens in London where poverty exists you know what happens when you increase migration so high that people struggle to get jobs what happens when you allow properties to be brought up by millionaires from all over the world who never even come to the city and these these properties are left empty well it drives prices are part of fishery you know London's got 9 million people in it 9 million people and there's about 65 million in the whole country 9 million and not only that the house prices are extortionate immigration is changing towns beyond belief there's nothing for young people in London and what are they turning to well they're living in poverty the parents are working all day but they can't even afford to raise their kids well so what's happening they're going out and stabbing each other and there are solutions to this I mean you can start with actually solving the problems at the beginning solving the source problems reduce immigration prioritize police resources things basic things like that they can't even get those basics right but the police are doing something but there's an article here that says police gang strategy targets people unlikely to commit violence isn't this just so typical of the public sector in the UK is it's not just typical of the police this article in The Guardian says the Metropolitan Police strategy to tackle gangs appears to have court of a significant number of individuals who are according to secret police assessments do not pose a danger of committing violence well very well done to them they're catching people but they're catching the wrong people now I mean this is a really interesting article according to an assessment seen by the Guardian more than 40% of young people on a list from Haringey in North London our score disposing zero risk of causing harm some are assessed as being much more likely to be victims than if the data also shows the majority of those registered on the matrix are young men so we've got obvious truths obvious solutions and the police aren't doing it right the police aren't solving the problem I mean it's not all down to the police but the police could do one thing that would stop this and that's random stop and search not targeted stop and search that Sadiq Khan talks about which is basically just normal policing we need random stop and search in London now that's gonna help in the short term but in the long term we need to solve this problem by well creating a city that's worth living in giving people a reason to live a reason to get up in the morning when you when people go to work all day for buttons because the economy is so screwed not because the wage is so low because costs are so high when people live like that of course they're going to be driven to violence of course they can end up living in poverty and kids are going to have nothing to do going to have nothing to live for there's two things we do we need to start stop and search and the politicians need to start creating cities and towns in this country that are actually worth living in if you like that and want to see more remember to like
