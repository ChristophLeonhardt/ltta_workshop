IN THE PAST DAY, LONDON WAS
ONCE AGAIN THE TARGET OF A
TERROR ATTACK --
>>FROM WHAT I HAVE READ, THESE
PEOPLE HAD LEFT THE MIDNIGHT
PRAYER AT THIS MOSQUE, HAD
WALKED VERY CLOSE TO THE MOSQUE,
AND HAD FOUND AN ELDERLY MAN WHO
HAD COLLAPSED FOR SOME
HEALTH-RELATED REASON AND WERE
AIDING HIM WHEN THEY WERE HIT BY
THIS MONSTER WITH HIS VAN.
SO
EVEN WORSE, AND ONE DID AND UP
DYING --
>>AND I HAVE READ THAT THE IMAM
AT THAT MOSQUE --
>>I'M SURE THEY DIDN'T
APPRECIATE THAT AT THE TIME BUT
THAT'S OF COURSE THE RIGHT THING
TO DO IN THAT CASE --
>>THERE WAS INITIALLY -- AND
THIS IS ONE SMALL ASPECT, OF THE
SEA THE TRAGEDY IS THE DEATH AND
THE INJURIES -- BUT IN THE
INITIAL REPORTS THAT ANOTHER VAN
HAD RAMMED INTO SOMEONE, AND IN
FACT IN THE PAST DAY SOMEONE
ALSO RAN THEIR CAR INTO A POLICE
OFFICER'S VEHICLE IN PARIS,
AGAIN THANK FULLY ONLY THE
DRIVER WAS KILLED -- THERE WAS
SOME INITIAL INTEREST IN THIS
ATTACK AND VERY QUICKLY PEOPLE
MOVED ON AND DIDN'T REALLY CARE
TOO MUCH.
I NOTICED THAT ON FOX
NEWS AND BREITBART, THE
TERRORIST CENTRAL WEBSITES, THEY
DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
I DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING FROM DONALD FROM ABOUT
THIS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY
WERE INTERESTED WHEN THERE WAS
LAST A TERROR ATTACK,
GRANTED THAT WAS DAYS AGO, ONCE
IT TURNED OUT THAT THIS
GAVE TARGETED MUSLIMS RATHER
THAN BEING A MUSLIM,
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LITTLE LESS
INTEREST.
>>THAT'S SURPRISING TO JUST
ABOUT NOBODY.
I THINK THIS IMAM
SHOULD SET THE EXAMPLE FOR
EVERYBODY.
THERE WERE PEOPLE
TRYING TO KICK AND PUNCH THIS
DRIVER, WHO IT TURNS OUT IS A
WELSH FATHER OF FOUR.
>>WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE SHOUTED
HE WANTS TO KILL ALL MUSLIMS
AT THE SCENE, WE NEVER KNOW FOR
SURE WITH THESE REPORTS.
>>AND IN THE VAN AFTERWARDS HE
WAS BLOWING KISSES TO PEOPLE.
SOME OF THE EARLY REPORTS I SAW
-- USUALLY AFTER THESE YOU SAY I
CAN'T BELIEVE JOHN DID THIS, HE
WAS ALWAYS A QUIET --
>>YOU COULD'VE USED SOME OTHER
NAME, BUT --
>>I COULD HAVE.
MARK.
BUT THE
PEOPLE I SAW TALKING ABOUT HIM
SAY, IT'S LIKE HIM.
IT'S NOT
SURPRISING.
THAT'S JUST
ANECDOTAL, BUT REALLY
UNDERSCORING ALL OF THIS IS THE
STORY OF THIS IMAM, WHO IS JUST
LIKE MOST PEOPLE WITHIN HIS
RELIGION, SAYING GET AWAY, STOP
BEING BRUTAL TO THIS GUY.
WE
WILL ARREST HIM -- PROTECTED
THIS GUY, AND THAT WILL BE HIS
LAST MEMORY OF A NIGHT THAT WILL
CHANGE HIS LIFE, TALKING ABOUT
THE KILLER, IS THAT THIS IMAM
PROTECTED AND SAVED HIS LIFE.
>>IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING RIGHT
IN THAT STORY WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH THAT IMAM.
AND HONESTLY
WITH THE COOLHEADED NEIGHBOR OF
LONDON, IT'S A REAL EXAMPLE AS
WE LOOK AT OUR LEADERSHIP AND
SEE EVERYTHING POLITICIZED AND
DIVIDED, HE'S HAVING TO RIDE
HERD OVER A CITY THAT IS
BRINGING TOGETHER A LOT OF
DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES BUT IS
ALSO THE FOCUS OF TERRORISM, AND
IT'S A LOT OF ONE-OFF TERRORISM.
A LOT OF COPYCAT TERRORISM, ALL
THE SORT OF THING.
SO HIS JOB IS
A TOUGH ONE, AND IT'S NO SMALL
FOOTNOTE THAT HE HIMSELF IS
MUSLIM, TO PERHAPS BE THE
RIGHT GUY AT THIS TIME FOR THAT
CITY.
>>HE'S UNDER A LOT OF, I WOULD
SAY, SCRUTINY TOO BECAUSE OF THE
FIRE THAT JUST HAPPEN THERE
SEPARATE FROM THE SHOOTINGS,
IT'S A TERRIBLE TIME TO BE MAYOR
OF LONDON, BUT AS YOU SAID MAYBE
A GOOD TIME TO HAVE A MUSLIM
MAYOR.
BUT THE FIRE IS AN
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THING HE'S
TAKING HEAT FOR.
>>THANKFULLY SO FAR IN THE WAKE
OF THIS TERROR ATTACK DONALD
TRUMP HAS NOT ATTACKED HIM ON
TWITTER, BUT WE WILL SEE.
THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER OF
THE U.K., SAID --
>>THAT SENTIMENT WAS ECHOED BY
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE
INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR THE
STUDY OF RADICALIZATION, WHO
SAID --
>>THAT'S THE THING, THEY ARE
JUST LOOKING TO GET PEOPLE WHO
ARE FANS OF THEM TO ATTACK
PEOPLE, THEY WANT THEIR OWN
PEOPLE, THEY WANT MUSLIMS IN THE
WEST, TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO
PLACE IN SOCIETY.
THEY WANT THEM
TO FEEL LIKE THE ONLY PLACE THEY
CAN TURN IS TO SOME SORT OF
RADICALIZATION.
AND IT DOESN'T
HURT THEIR MISSION WHEN PEOPLE
ON THE OTHER SIDE FEEL LIKE,
WELL, THEY KILLED SOME OF OURS,
WE WILL KILL SOME OF THEM.
WHICH
IS APPARENTLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING
IN THIS CASE.
JOHN OLIVER HAD A
GREAT RESPONSE TO I BELIEVE THE
MANCHESTER BOMBING -- IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THE STABBING, ACTUALLY
-- TALKING ABOUT THE RESILIENCY
OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE IN THE
FACE OF THIS, BUT THIS HAS BEEN
A ROUGH SET OF WEEKS FOR
THOSE IN THE U.K.,
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE AREA OF
LONDON, WHERE IT FEELS THAT
YOU CAN'T GO A COUPLE OF DAYS
WITHOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
>>THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT QUEEN
ELIZABETH, WHO, WITH HER
GRANDSON AND ONE OF HER SONS,
WAS VISITING SOME OF THE VICTIMS
FROM MANCHESTER, TO THE TOWER
FIRE, TO THE STABBING, AND HOW
PEOPLE HAVEN'T FELT THIS WAY, OR
OLDER BRITONS HAVEN'T FELT THIS
WAY, SINCE THE WAR.
WHEN THE
MONARCH WOULD GO FROM PLACE TO
PLACE DURING THE WAR, IT WAS
EDWARD THEN, BUT IT'S AMAZING
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.
WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT
THERE IS SOMEBODY --
THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING ALMOST
ON A WEEKLY BASIS.
>>THERE IS A SENSE OF OUR MOST A
SIEGE MENTALITY THERE.
AND
TERRORISM IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT KEEPS THE PUBLIC ON EDGE,
AND I THINK JOHN CORRECTLY
IDENTIFIES THAT THEY WANT THAT
ANXIETY, THEY WANT THE MUSLIM
COMMUNITY TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY
HAVE TO HANG TOGETHER,
ASSIMILATING WITH THIS
HETEROGENEOUS COMMUNITY OF
LONDON ISN'T WHAT WE WANT.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS SO
SPECIAL ABOUT LONDON, I THINK
THEY DO HAVE SORT OF AN
INTEGRATED COMMUNITY, PEOPLE
FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
HISTORICALLY WITH DIFFERENT
FAITHS, AND SORT OF THE CROSS
POLLINATION OF THESE RELIGIONS.
IN A SENSE LONDON WILL BE A
TOUGH NOT TO CRACK IF THEY ARE
TRYING TO DIVIDE THESE
COMMITTEES.
>>IT'S EASY TO SEE IN THE SHORT
SPAN OF TIME THESE INCIDENTS,
WHICH ARE TRAGIC, AND THINK THAT
THEY MUST BE MAKING HEADWAY, BUT
IT'S INCREDIBLY LIKELY THAT THEY
ARE NOT.
AS YOU SAID, THIS IS
NOT SOME NEW THING WHERE YOU
HAVE DIVERSITY IN LONDON.
THAT'S
THE HISTORIC STATE OF LONDON.
AND I AGREE, I THINK THEY WILL
HAVE VERY HARD TIMES ADVANCING
THEIR MISSION IN THE
PARTICULAR WAY THEY WANT.
