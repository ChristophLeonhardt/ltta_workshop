1
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,530
if you were aware of what was going on

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the last presidential election</font>

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,760
basically politics was revolutionized by

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,770
what Barack Obama did on the technology

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,619
side communications and marketing blue

6
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,119
state digital obviously did a ton of

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,160
that describe<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system a little bit</font>

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">because obviously big email component of</font>

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,210
it you had the website what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look</font>

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,120
like I mean the magical number for me is

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,250
the the fact that one out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of five of the</font>

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,450
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> voted for President Obama</font>

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">was on the email list so ended up being</font>

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,070
nearly 14 million people you know built

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,410
organically over 22 months that

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,300
responded to everything from fundraising

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to doing virtual phone calls on Election</font>

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,460
Day really did developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that narrative</font>

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,750
around the campaign that gave people

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,760
multiple opportunities to engage and

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,410
breaking down the silos of the

22
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,880
traditional campaign so it wasn't

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,800
development or fundraising in one area

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,200
field and communications in another it

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">really created a level playing field for</font>

26
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,100
everyone whether you're taught to your

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,630
donor or an individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> who gives five</font>

28
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,280
dollars a month that access to the

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,079
campaign in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the candidate and obviously</font>

30
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get used to technology very quickly</font>

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,170
assume people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of forgotten</font>

32
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,939
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how innovated this was at the time</font>

33
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,819
but what was what were things like 22

34
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,950
months earlier yeah and we've been the

35
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,299
competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we've been developing</font>

36
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,889
the technology sense sort of

37
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:25,240
frustrations out of the Dean campaign

38
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,999
and through our work with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democratic</font>

39
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">Party a lot of trade unions and a lot of</font>

40
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,799
the corporate clients we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> its we've</font>

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,420
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this proprietary license based</font>

42
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,729
service that you know the scalability

43
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,590
was a challenge for an effort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

44
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,999
size of another presidential campaign

45
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,020
but we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to come to the table</font>

46
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say you as a campaign you don't need</font>

47
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hire a bunch of developers we have</font>

48
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,530
these tools let us keep working on them

49
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,539
everything from how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a million</font>

50
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">emails out in a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of minutes to</font>

51
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">that log in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beau system that allowed</font>

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,240
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really create their own local</font>

53
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,999
organizing capacity individually there

54
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,259
are competitors and all the different

55
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">modules of the software but the bundling</font>

56
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,880
up and allowing the data integrity to

57
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,880
exist in one system that scales is sort

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,258
of the competitive differentiation and

59
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,119
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built before this</font>

60
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much was built on them the most</font>

61
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,590
the vast majority of it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> built prior</font>

62
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,650
to the campaign

63
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,180
was optimization of it and then the

64
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,939
scalability with that was required we're

65
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,379
now going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the phases of making</font>

66
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,909
all the tools internationalized for our
