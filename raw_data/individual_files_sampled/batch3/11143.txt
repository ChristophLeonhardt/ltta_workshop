US National Security Advisor John Bolton's announced that America is reviewing all international agreements that would expose it to the International Court of Justice let's get more on this now live to our Washington correspondent America on hi there what's causing Washington to start backing out of these agreements so hastily well to simplify it a bit what the US is withdrawing from exactly is an optional protocol on disputes to the Vienna Convention which will prevent countries like Iran and Palestine from suing the u.s. at The Hague a National Security Advisor John Bolton tried to justify the decision by portraying the provision as a violation of US sovereignty a citing a case brought on by Palestine contesting the decision to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in his statement Bolton went out of his way to take a dig at a Palestine calling it be so-called state of Palestine he then went on to announce that this administration would be reviewing all international agreements that leave the u.s. vulnerable to things like accountability and international law saying that Republican administrations of the past had left agreements like this one for this very reason but let's check out how Bolton explained it we will commence a review of all international agreements that may still expose the United States to purported binding jurisdiction dispute resolution in the International Court of Justice the United States will not sit idly by as faceless politicized claims are brought against us earlier today Pompeo announced to the world the u.s. was leaving a friendship treaty with Iran that established diplomatic ties with the country back in 1955 and it was apparently a response to the ICJ ruling that ordered Washington to lift Iranian sanctions on humanitarian goods which Pompeo describes as Iranian propaganda Iran has attempted interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take a lawful actions necessary to protect our national security an Iran is abusing the ICJ for political and propaganda purposes of course this isn't the first time the US has shown complete disregard for international law earlier this year the u.s. withdrew from the Human Rights Council now seeing that this has happened it leaves one question how will the US or any other Western country for that matter be kept in check without an effective international governing body and it looks like this move might just revive those discussions yeah with the u.s. putting itself above admonishment but also those countries that probably don't feel they've got recourse to action now okay Samira Khan in Washington thanks for that well our teeth roughly video Agency has been asking people in Tehran what they think about the International Court ruling on lifting some of the sanctions the world knows that the US has violated the law they don't have an owner their own word they signed the nuclear deal and now they've changed their mind even those who have problems with our country accepted that this act is illegal Donald Trump is crazy really crazy what is this saying even he doesn't understand what he's saying officials and even civilians say we should stand up against America's excessive demands this ruling will not please mr. Trump and his friends and we will see their reaction but it will be futile the u.s. acted against human rights The Hague ruling is completely sound food medicine fertilizer all go towards people's livelihoods they should never have to live in poverty political analysts say Ed Mustafa Christian believes the Washington's too focused on itself and that affects its attitude to international law and treaties the u.s. believes that it's an exceptional state as President Obama stated and he believed in that but President Trump is a real manifestation of this wrong idea that the u.s. is exceptional all other nations should abide by the rules and regulations except for the United States so therefore the u.s. is adamant to the rule of the law it has proved to be an irresponsible actor and it's been you know disrespecting international treaties rules as well as agreements under President Donald Trump the situation has been even worse in the meantime sanctions play a pivotal role to the United States current power you see against Iran to intimidate and pressure Iran into negotiations therefore I believe that Donald trum and his administration would not abide by the law you
