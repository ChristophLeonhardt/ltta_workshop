PROSECUTION POINT OF VIEW WAS 

376
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,875
METICULOUSLY DETAILED, AND IT 

377
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,643
TOOK AS LONG AS NEEDED TO TAKE 

378
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,112
TO MAKE SURE IT WAS THOROUGHLY 

379
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,414
PROCESSED AND ACCURATELY 

380
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,281
PROCESSED.

381
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,383
THE OTHER SCENE WAS AT THE HOTEL

382
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,154
WHERE WE WERE WITH THE FAMILY 

383
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:35,387
MEMBERS.

384
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,822
HAVING TO TELL WITH THE FBI 

385
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,992
ADVOCATES AND MY ADVOCATES THAT 

386
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,960
A CHILD, SOME 14 YEARS OLD DEAD 

387
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,328
IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS YOU

388
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:47,433
HAVE TO DO IN YOUR CAREER.

389
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,134
THESE PARENTS TREMENDOUS 

390
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:51,370
FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING AND AGAIN 

391
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,439
PLEASE RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY.

392
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,207
WE WERE THERE UNTIL ABOUT 3:30 

393
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,609
IN THE MORNING WITH THESE 

394
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:00,278
FAMILIES AND MANY OF THEM HAD 

395
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:01,279
SIBLINGS WHO WERE IN THE SCHOOL 

396
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,548
AND SURVIVED AND THEN A BROTHER 

397
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,484
OR A SISTER DID NOT.

398
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,520
SO THAT WAS EXTREMELY TRAGIC.

399
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,456
BUT WE ARE PRAYING FOR THESE 

400
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,259
FAMILIES AND ARE CONTINUING TO 

401
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:14,826
PRAY FOR THESE FAMILIES AND 

402
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:18,030
JUSTICE IS DONE FOR THE ONE THAT

403
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,298
BRUTALLY MURDERED ALL OF THESE 

404
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:19,565
STUDENTS.

405
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,266
MY JOB NOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE 

406
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,902
TO HELP THE VICTIMS AND THE 

407
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,169
FAMILIES.

408
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,603
WE HAVE GOTTEN TO ALL OF THE 

409
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,072
VICTIMS WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES

410
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,341
TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP PAY 

411
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,043
FOR THEIR FUNERAL EXPENSES.

412
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,444
IF YOU ARE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH 

413
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,145
YOUR FAMILY WE WILL BE COMING TO

414
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:37,049
YOU TODAY TO HELP YOU TO MAKE 

415
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,784
SURE WE HELP WITH YOUR HOSPITAL 

416
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,184
BILLS.

417
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,620
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 

418
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:41,820
THERE.

419
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,155
WE WILL BE ON SCENE WITH THE FBI

420
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,456
AND SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAS DONE 

421
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,259
A GREAT JOB, OUR ADVOCATES WILL 

422
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,794
BE THERE TO PROVIDE COUNSELING.

423
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,529
WHAT WE SAW IN LAS VEGAS, WHAT 

424
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,532
WE SAW AT PULSE, PEOPLE WHO -- 

425
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,134
WE DON'T THINK WERE IMPACTED 

426
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,334
WERE IMPACTED.

427
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:58,437
SO WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE 

428
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,605
COUNSELING FOR ALL OF THEM.

429
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,006
I WAS ON THE PHONE UNTIL 2:00 

430
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,574
A.M. WITH GO FUND ME AND AGAIN 

431
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:03,708
FIRST THING THIS MORNING.

432
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,211
IT IS SAFE TO GIVE TO GO FUND 

433
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:06,377
ME.

434
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,514
THEY'RE PULLING BAD WEBSITES OFF

435
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,650
CONSTANTLY AND MONITORING 

436
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:11,950
EVERYTHING.

437
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,452
IN FACT, ONE OF THE TOP PEOPLE 

438
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,687
AT GO FUND ME KNEW A VICTIM, 

439
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,855
KNEW A VICTIM.

440
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,490
THAT'S HOW FAR REACHING THIS IS.

441
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,425
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE 

442
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,393
UNIFIED SIDE.

443
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,228
SO PLEASE DON'T BE AFRAID TO 

444
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,829
GIVE TO GO FUND ME AND ALL OF 

445
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,431
THESE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES

446
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:29,768
WILL BE PROTECTED AND AGAIN 

447
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,402
GOVERNOR, I CANNOT THANK YOU FOR

448
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,303
YOUR SUPPORT.

449
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,105
WE HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE 

450
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:33,405
CONSTANTLY.

451
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,541
HE WAS HERE THE SECOND THIS 

452
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:35,808
HAPPENED.

453
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,344
I CAN'T THANK YOU, FDLE, THE 

454
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,612
SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND THE FBI 

455
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:40,846
ENOUGH.

456
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,413
THIS IS WHAT YOU DON'T SEE 

457
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,114
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

458
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,315
YOU SEE TEAMWORK.

459
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,319
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN FLORIDA.

460
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,989
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US VERY 

461
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:50,222
SPECIAL.

462
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:50,489
THANK YOU.

463
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,292
>> BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS.

464
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,829
I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THANK 

465
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,596
CONGRESSMAN TED DEUTSCHE FROM 

466
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,965
COMING DOWN FROM WASHINGTON, 

467
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:00,132
D.C.

468
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,501
THE ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM 

469
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,103
AROUND THE COUNTY.

470
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,007
MY MESSAGE TO THE COMMUNITY IS 

471
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:08,841
SIMPLE.

472
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,010
YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS, YOUR 

473
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,812
COMMISSIONERS, YOUR STATE REPS, 

474
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,814
YOUR STATE SENATORS, MAKE SURE 

475
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,418
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T 

476
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,221
WORRYING ABOUT MILLAGE RATES AND

477
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:22,688
SAVING MONEY.

478
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,857
THIS IS A TIME TO SAVE LIVES.

479
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,758
WE NEED MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

480
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:27,025
DEPUTIES.

481
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,194
THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO WORRY 

482
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,862
ABOUT HOW MANY DOLLARS MIGHT BE 

483
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:34,199
SAVED IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEPUTY 

484
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,334
HERE OR A POLICE OFFICER HERE.

485
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,836
THIS IS NATIONWIDE.

486
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,273
WE NEED MORE HEROES, MORE FIRST 

487
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,541
RESPONDERS, NOT LESS FIRST 

488
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,509
RESPONDERS.

489
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,411
AND I KNOW MANY STATES HAVE 

490
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:48,480
DIFFERENT TERMS TO HELP OUR 

491
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,848
MENTALLY ILL.

492
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,550
WE ALL PRAY FOR OUR MENTALLY ILL

493
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,053
AND PRAY FOR THEM TO RECOVER.

494
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,754
WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE OR A FAMILY 

495
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,456
WHO IS AFFECTED BY SOMEONE 

496
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,992
SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS.

497
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:05,563
THE BAKER ACT IN FLORIDA ALLOWS 

498
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,933
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR MEDICAL 

499
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,434
PROFESSIONALS TO CONFINE A 

500
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:11,036
PERSON INVOLUNTARILY WHILE THEY 

501
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:15,274
GET EXAMINED AN LOOKED AT.

502
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,742
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REASON 

503
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:18,944
THAT THEY'RE A THREAT TO 

504
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,346
THEMSELVES OR SOMEONE ELSE.

505
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,482
WHAT I'M ASKING OUR LAWMAKERS TO

506
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,618
DO IS GO BACK TO PLACES LIKE 

507
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,820
TALLAHASSEE AND WASHINGTON, D.C.

508
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,955
AND GIVE POLICE THE POWER IF 

509
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,824
THEY SEE SOMETHING ON SOCIAL 

510
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,258
MEDIA, IF THEY SEE GRAPHIC 

511
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,895
PICTURES OF RIFLES AND BLOOD AND

512
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,332
GORE AND GUNS AND BOMBS, IF THEY

513
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,134
SEE SOMETHING HORRIFIC LANGUAGE,

514
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,635
IF THEY SEE A PERSON TALKING 

515
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,370
ABOUT I WANT TO GROW UP TO BE A 

516
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,639
SERIAL KILLER, WE NEED TO HAVE 

517
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,608
THE POWER TO TAKE THAT PERSON 

518
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,811
AND BRING THEM BEFORE A MENTAL 

519
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,346
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AT THAT 

520
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,447
PARTICULAR TIME.

521
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,082
INVOLUNTARILY AND HAVE THEM 

522
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:57,349
EXAMINED.

523
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,951
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 

524
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,185
RIGHTFULLY SO CONCERNED ABOUT 

525
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,787
THEIR RIGHTS AS AM I.

526
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,188
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF 

527
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,255
THESE STUDENTS.

528
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,457
WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF YOUNG 

529
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,593
KIDS WHO GO TO SCHOOLS WITH BOOK

530
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,926
BAGS AND PENCILS, DON'T THEY 

531
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,662
HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED 

532
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,329
BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 

533
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,098
TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY?

534
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,800
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE DOING.

535
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,367
ANY QUESTIONS?

536
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,636
>> SHERIFF, THE CONDITION OF THE

537
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,872
PEOPLE INJURED?

538
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,808
>> COACH FEIS.

539
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,276
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE INCIDENT 

540
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,545
YET OR WHAT HIS PERFORMANCE WAS 

541
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,613
BUT I KNOW AARON PERSONALLY.

542
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,815
I COACHED WITH HIM.

543
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:36,855
MY TWO BOYS PLAYED FOR HIM.

544
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,089
I DON'T KNOW WHEN AARON'S 

545
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:38,824
FUNERAL IS.

546
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,791
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ADULTS ARE

547
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,693
GOING TO GO BUT YOU'LL GET 2,000

548
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,694
KIDS THERE.

549
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,130
THE KIDS IN THIS COMMUNITY LOVED

550
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,497
AND ADORED HIM.

551
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,331
HE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST 

552
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:46,965
PEOPLE I KNEW.

553
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,134
HE WAS A PHENOMENAL MAN.

554
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,435
I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS YET.

555
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:54,573
BUT I COULD TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN 

556
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,476
AARON FEIS DIED WHEN HE WAS 

557
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,878
KILLED, TRAGICALLY HE DID IT 

558
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:00,812
PROTECTING OTHERS.

559
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,280
YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT BECAUSE 

560
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,114
THAT'S WHO HE WAS. 

561
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,516
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 

562
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,350
CONDITION THOSE INJURED, WHAT 

563
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,618
ARE THE EXTENTS OF THEIR 

564
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,086
INJURIES AND WHAT KIND DID THEY 

565
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:08,353
HAVE?

566
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,856
>> WE ARE FORTUNATE TODAY TO 

567
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,159
HAVE OUR DOCTORS WHO WORKED SO 

568
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,094
TIRELESSLY AND SAVE SO MANY 

569
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:17,362
LIVES YESTERDAY SO WE'RE GOING 

570
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,964
TO BRING UP ONE OF OUR DOCTORS 

571
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,298
TO SPEAK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE 

572
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:23,936
QUESTIONS AND ANSWER THOSE 

573
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,436
QUESTIONS.

574
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,240
DOCTOR.

575
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,543
>> THANK YOU.

576
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:31,910
GOOD AFTERNOON.

577
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,813
DR. EVAN BOYAR, DIRECTOR AND 

578
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,247
CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 

579
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:37,682
EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT BROWARD 

580
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,685
HEALTH NORTH AND I ALSO HAVE 

581
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,254
COLLEAGUES FROM BROWARD HEALTH 

582
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:42,921
MAIN HERE.

583
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,891
AND THE THREE OF US COLLECTIVELY

584
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:46,858
HOPEFULLY COULD ANSWER SOME OF 

585
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,659
THOSE QUESTIONS.

586
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:50,962
SO FOR STARTERS, JUST BECAUSE 

587
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,864
WE'RE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS 

588
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,000
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NUMB TO THE 

589
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,768
EMOTIONS AND WE SEND OUT OUR 

590
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,338
SYMPATHY TO ALL THE FAMILIES 

591
00:18:59,338 --> 00:18:59,605
INVOLVED.

592
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,740
THE WORST THING IS A PARENT IS 

593
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,141
IF YOUR KID DOESN'T COME HOME 

594
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,009
FROM SCHOOL THAT DAY HITS HOME 

595
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,612
PRETTY HARD AND WE SYMPATHIZE 

596
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:08,180
FOR THEM.

597
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,249
WITH THAT BEING SAID, NOWADAYS 

598
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,785
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO DRILLS FOR 

599
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:13,985
THIS.

600
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,687
ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO WE DID A 

601
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,921
DRILL AT OUR FACILITY 

602
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,957
SPECIFICALLY FOR AN ACTIVE 

603
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:19,224
SHOOTER.

604
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,893
SO WHEN IT BECOMES A LIVE EVENT,

605
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,363
WE CAN WORK SEAMLESSLY WITH FIRE

606
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,065
RESCUES, BSO IN ORDER TO ENSURE 

607
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:27,699
PATIENT SAFETY.

608
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,168
I WANT TO COMMEND THE 

609
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,903
PREHOSPITAL PERSONNEL YESTERDAY 

610
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,472
FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND ALL THE 

611
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,741
EFFORTS AT BROWARD HEALTH NORTH,

612
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,008
BROWARD HEALTH MAIN AND CORAL 

613
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,443
SPRINGS MEDICAL CENTER GOT A 

614
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,479
COUPLE OF PATIENTS AS WELL.

615
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,648
SPECIFICALLY TO BROWARD HEALTH 

616
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,916
NORTH, AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO 

617
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,152

HEALTH MAIN.

619
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,555
WE HAD A TOTAL OF NINE PATIENTS.

620
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,924
ONE WAS THE SUSPECT TREATED AND 

621
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:53,191
RELEASED.

622
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,827
WE HAD TWO PATIENTS DECEASED.

623
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,095
THREE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN 

624
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:57,428
DISCHARGED.

625
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,096
WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE PATIENTS

626
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:00,198
IN THE HOSPITAL.

627
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,967
ONE WITH AN EXTREMITY WOUND WHO 

628
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,102
IS DOING WELL AND WORKING WITH 

629
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,071
PHYSICAL THERAPY AND ANOTHER 

630
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,739
PATIENT STILL INTUBATED AFTER 

631
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,740
PENETRATING TRAUMA TO THE CHEST 

632
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,074
BUT DOING WELL AND FOLLOWING 

633
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:12,344
COMMANDS AND A THIRD PATIENT 

634
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,347
THAT REMAINS INTUBATED IN 

635
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,848
CRITICAL CONDITION.

636
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,549
DR. MENENDEZ.

637
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,751
>> I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR THE 

638
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,021
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF BROWARD 

639
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,357
HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER.

640
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,057
YESTERDAY WAS A TRAGEDY THAT WE 

641
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:27,693
AS A TEAM TOOK CARE OF THESE 

642
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,060
PATIENTS.

643
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,997
WE ARE A FACILITY.

644
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:32,964
WE SAW SEVEN PATIENTS.

645
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:34,332
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO PATIENTS 

646
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:37,069
THAT ARE CRITICAL/STABLE 

647
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,469
CONDITION.

648
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,771
THE OTHER FIVE WENT HOME OR ON 

649
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,441
THEIR WAY HOME AND THEY'RE IN 

650
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,475
GOOD CONDITION.

651
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,879
THE OTHER TWO, STABLE CONDITION.

652
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,449
I HAVE DR. FUENTE.

653
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,151
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS HE CAN

654
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,021
TELL YOU.

655
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:56,855
>> THANK YOU.

656
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,356
I'M THE TRAUMA MEDICAL DIRECTOR 

657
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,124
AT BROWARD HEALTH MEDICAL 

658
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:01,026
CENTER.

659
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,026
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS BECOMING 

660
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,095
ROUTINE FOR US NOW.

661
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,496
THIS IS THE SECOND EPISODE WE 

662
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,531
HAVE HAD IN A YEAR.

663
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,032
WHICH IS VERY SAD.

664
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,900
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS

665
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,068
THAT THIS SECOND TIME AROUND 

666
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,704
JUST LIKE THE FIRST TIME AROUND,

667
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,072
THE FIRST RESPONDERS DID A 

668
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:14,706
TERRIFIC JOB.

669
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,007
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO UNDERSTAND 

670
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:19,344
WHAT WE DO IN TRAUMA, TIME IS OF

671
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,279
THE ESSENCE AND REALLY THE 

672
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,148
DELIVERY OF THOSE PATIENTS WAS 

673
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:23,982
FANTASTIC YESTERDAY.

674
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,919
IT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE

675
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,253
OUTCOMES.

676
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,789
AS DR. MENENDEZ SAID WE RECEIVED

677
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,724
SEVEN PATIENTS, ONE WAS 

678
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,392
DISCHARGED LAST NIGHT.

679
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,126
WE HAD ONE THAT WAS IN CRITICAL 

680
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,895
CONDITION THAT WENT TO SURGERY.

681
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,831
WE HAD TWO MORE STABLE PATIENTS 

682
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,768
THAT ALSO REQUIRED SURGERY.

683
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,637
WE HAD -- THERE'S STILL OUT OF 

684
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:49,541
THE SIX LEFT IN THIS OF THE.

685
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,811
HOPING TO SEND TWO HOME TODAY.

686
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,347
BUT I EXPECT FULL RECOVERY.

687
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,483
>> CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US ARE 

688
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,886
YOU PREPARED TO TELL US THAT 

689
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:01,986
NIKOLAS CRUZ IS THE SAME PERSON 

690
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:05,823
THAT WROTE THE YOUTUBE COMMENT?

691
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:06,691
CAN YOU COMMENT ABOUT THE 

692
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:07,125
YOUTUBE POST?

693
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,927
>> WE DO NOT KNOW IF IT'S THE 

694
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,995
SAME PERSON.

695
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,030
WE DID OUR DATABASE CHECKING AND

696
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,465
COULD NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFYING

697
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,767
HIM AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT 

698
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:15,967
AGAIN.

699
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,669
BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO SAY AT 

700
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,872
THIS TIME IT WAS THE SAME 

701
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:21,105
PERSON.

702
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:23,341
>> SHERIFF -- 

703
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,276
>> IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT 

704
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:27,245
SOMEONE WAS SPECIFICALLY 

705
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,579
TARGETED THAT STARTED ALL OF 

706
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:28,780
THIS?

707
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,482
>> NOT AT THIS TIME.

708
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,150
THAT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.

709
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,786
THE FBI, THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT 

710
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,421
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND BROWARD 

711
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,056
SHERIFF'S OFFICE WILL BE WORKING

712
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,859
CON JUNG ACTIVELY TO INTERVIEW 

713
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,528
AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN SO DOWN

714
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,462
THE ROAD WE CAN UNCOVER THIS 

715
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:44,830
INFORMATION.

716
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,432
RIGHT NOW IT'S NO MORE THAN A 

717
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:47,765
POSSIBILITY. 

718
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:49,401
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW HE GOT IN?

719
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,269
>> WE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THAT.

720
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,405
WE DO KNOW ABOUT THAT AND AT OUR

721
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,140
NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE I WILL 

722
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,508
TAKE THE MEDIA THROUGH A 

723
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,510
TIMELINE AND TALK ABOUT THROUGH 

724
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,912
VIDEOTAPES, WE'LL MATCH UP VIDEO

725
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,415
WITH REALTIME INFORMATION AND 

726
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:09,254
DISSEMINATE THAT.

727
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:09,821
[ TALKING OVER ONE ANOTHER ]

728
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:14,058
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 

729
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:17,395
HOW HE OBTAINED THE AR-15?

730
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,064
WE UNDERSTAND IT WAS LEGALLY 

731
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:19,297
BOUGHT. 

732
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,832
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO RELEASE 

733
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,133
THAT UNTIL LATER TODAY IF WE DO 

734
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,269
AT ALL TODAY.

735
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,270
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALCOHOL, 

736
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,871
TOBACCO AND FIREARMS, THOSE 

737
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:27,839
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO 

738
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,274
TRACK DOWN, THE HISTORY OF THIS 

739
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:29,507
WEAPON.

740
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:30,608
WE BELIEVE WE KNOW WHERE THE 

741
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:32,177
WEAPON WAS PURCHASED, WHERE THE 

742
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:32,844
WEAPON CAME FROM.

743
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,279
BUT THAT'S BEING PIECED 

744
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:34,846
TOGETHER.

745
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,681

00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,576
AND ALSO BEING VERY RESPECTFUL 

1115
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:16,314
OF THE FAMILIES, THE LOVED ONES 

1116
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,684
BUT HE SAID IN THE DAYS AHEAD HE

1117
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,985
WOULD ANIMATED ABOUT THE 

1118
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:21,285
DISCUSSION.

1119
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,288
MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE 

1120
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,091
SHERIFF AND ALSO GOVERNOR RICK 

1121
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,459
SCOTT WERE ASKING ABOUT GUN 

1122
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:28,692
CONTROL.

1123
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:30,194
WE HEARD FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT

1124
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,596
WHO SAID THAT IN TALKING WITH 

1125
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,298
THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY 

1126
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,666
RECEIVING COUNSELING THAT THEY 

1127
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,469
ASKED THEIR PARENTS, OTHER 

1128
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,871
PEOPLE ABOUT SENSIBLE GUN 

1129
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:41,204
CONTROL LAWS.

1130
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:43,608
THE STUDENTS THERE HAVING GONE 

1131
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,308
THROUGH THIS ARE NOW ASKING 

1132
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,476
ABOUT THAT AND THAT IS A 

1133
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,278
DISCUSSION THAT WILL BE TAKING 

1134
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,278
PLACE AT SOME POINT.

1135
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:50,714
I WANT TO GO TO OUR CHIEF 

1136
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:52,016
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE 

1137
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:52,283
THOMAS.

1138
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,619
THE FBI AGENT THAT WAS THERE WAS

1139
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,420
SAYING THEY WERE AWARE OF THAT 

1140
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,922
YOUTUBE POSTING BUT AS WE HEARD 

1141
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:01,725
WITH TOM, THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO 

1142
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,194
GET ANY MORE INFORMATION 

1143
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,129
DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE SHOOTER.

1144
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,031
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ROBIN.

1145
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,499
CLEARLY, THERE'S GOING TO BE 

1146
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,501
MORE WORK DONE IN TERMS OF WHERE

1147
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,838
THE SIGNS WERE MISSED.

1148
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,439
I ALSO WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT 

1149
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,274
THAT THEY MENTIONED THERE'S 

1150
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:20,978
STILL BODIES IN THE ROOM, IN THE

1151
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,211
SCHOOL.

1152
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:21,445
ROBIN. 

1153
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,582
>> HERE'S THE PRESIDENT.

1154
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,151
>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS.

1155
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:34,158
TODAY I SPEAK TO A NATION IN 

1156
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:34,358
GRIEF.

1157
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,962
YESTERDAY A SCHOOL FILLED WITH 

1158
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,463
INNOCENT CHILDREN AND CARING 

1159
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:43,200
TEACHERS BECAME THE SCENE OF 

1160
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,271
TERRIBLE VIOLENCE, HATRED AND 

1161
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:47,872
EVIL.

1162
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,674
AROUND 2:30 YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 

1163
00:36:50,674 --> 00:36:55,512
POLICE RESPONDED TO REPORTS OF 

1164

FLORIDA.

1167
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,989
A GREAT AND SAFE COMMUNITY.

1168
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:08,158
THERE A SHOOTER WHO IS NOW IN 

1169
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:10,861
CUSTODY OPENED FIRE ON

00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,413
HEART IS PRAYING FOR THE VICTIMS

1176
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,817

NO CHILD, NO TEACHER SHOULD EVER

00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,218
BE IN DANGER IN AN AMERICAN 

1188
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:07,451
SCHOOL.

1189
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,520
NO PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE TO 

1190
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,555
FEAR FOR THEIR SONS AND 

1191
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,557
DAUGHTERS WHEN THEY KISS THEM 

1192
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:17,795
GOODBYE IN THE MORNING.

1193
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,630
EACH PERSON WHO WAS STOLEN FROM 

1194
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,765
US YESTERDAY HAD A FULL LIFE 

1195
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:22,867
AHEAD OF THEM.

1196
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:28,339
A LIFE FILLED WITH WONDROUS 

1197
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,906
BEAUTY AND UNLIMITED POTENTIAL 

1198
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:31,275
AND PROMISE.

1199
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,011
EACH ONE HAD DREAMS TO PURSUE, 

1200
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,279
LOVE TO GIVE AND TALENTS TO 

1201
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,681
SHARE WITH THE WORLD.

1202
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:42,986
AND EACH ONE HAD A FAMILY TO 

1203
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:46,490
WHOM THEY MEANT EVERYTHING IN 

1204
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,758
THE WORLD.

00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,537
AND WE HURT FOR THE ENTIRE 

1210
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:02,172

THAT IS NOW IN SHOCK AND PAIN 

1212
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:08,846

00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,514
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, FIRST 

1214
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,783

00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,592
SOON AFTER THE SHOOTER I SPOKE 

1219
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,660
WITH GOVERNOR SCOTT TO CONVEY 

1220
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,531
OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO THE

00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,402
DETERMINATION TO ASSIST IN ANY 

1223
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:34,004
WAY THAT WE CAN.

1224
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,840
I ALSO SPOKE WITH FLORIDA 

1225
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,513

00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,750
I'M MAKING PLANS TO VISIT

00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,393
IN THESE MOMENTS OF HEARTACHE 

1234
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:59,663

WE TRUST IN THAT PROMISE AND WE 

1239
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:12,976
HOLD FAST TO OUR FELLOW

00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:14,578
AMERICANS IN THEIR TIME OF 

1241
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:14,845
SORROW.

1242
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,815
I WANT TO SPEAK NOW DIRECTLY TO 

1243
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,083
AMERICA'S CHILDREN.

1244
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,985
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FEEL LOST, 

1245
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,822
ALONE, CONFUSED OR EVEN SCARED.

1246
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,225
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE 

1247
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:32,963
NEVER ALONE AND YOU NEVER WILL 

1248
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:33,497
BE.

1249

YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT 

1250
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,433

00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,811
TEACHER, A FAMILY MEMBER, A 

1256

LOCAL POLICE OFFICER OR A FAITH

1258
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,717
ANSWER HATE WITH LOVE.

1259
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,821
ANSWER CRUELTY WITH KINDNESS.

1260
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:59,356
WE MUST ALSO WORK TOGETHER TO 

1261
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,226
CREATE A CULTURE IN OUR COUNTRY 

1262
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,094
THAT EMBRACES THE DIGNITY OF 

1263
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:07,230
LIFE THAT CREATES DEEP AND 

1264
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,400
MEANINGFUL HUMAN CONNECTIONS AND

1265
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,439
THAT TURNS CLASSMATES AND 

1266
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,707
COLLEAGUES INTO FRIENDS AND 

1267
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:16,974
NEIGHBORS.

1268
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,077
OUR ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING 

1269
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:20,711
CLOSELY WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES 

1270
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,780
TO INVESTIGATE THE SHOOTING AND 

1271
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,381
LEARN EVERYTHING WE CAN.

1272
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,616
WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

1273
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,985
STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS TO HELP 

1274
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,521
SECURE OUR SCHOOLS AND TACKLE 

1275
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34,658
THE DIFFICULT ISSUE OF MENTAL 

1276
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:34,891
HEALTH.

1277
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:36,493
LATER THIS MONTH I WILL BE 

1278
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,462
MEETING WITH THE NATION'S 

1279
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,197
GOVERNORS AND ATTORNEY GENERALS.

1280
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:44,535
WE'RE MAKING OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR

1281
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,671
CHILDREN SAFER WILL BE OUR TOP 

1282
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,005
PRIORITY.

1283
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,940
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY TAKE 

1284
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,042
ACTIONS THAT MAKE US FEEL LIKE 

1285
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,678
WE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

1286
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,983
WE MUST ACTUALLY MAKE THAT 

1287
00:41:58,983 --> 00:41:59,617
DIFFERENCE.

1288
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,518
IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY, THE BONDS 

1289
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:04,989
THAT SUSTAIN US ARE THOSE OF 

1290
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,992
FAMILY, FAITH, COMMUNITY AND 

1291
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:08,359
COUNTRY.

1292
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,360
THESE BONDS ARE STRONGER THAN 

1293
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,597
THE FORCES OF HATRED AND EVIL 

1294
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,232
AND THESE BONDS GROW EVEN 

1295
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:19,136

1308
00:42:56,573 --> 00:43:00,176
HE WAS ASKED JUST THEN WOULD HE 

1309
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:00,944
DO ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS.

1310
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:02,646
HE DID NOT ADDRESS THAT.

1311
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,980
HE DID TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH 

1312
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,149
BUT THAT WAS THE QUESTION 

1313
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,750
SHOUTED TO HIM AS HE WAS 

1314
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,117
LEAVING.

1315
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,152
HE HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 

1316
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:10,654

1328
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:29,073
SHOOTING.

1329
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,174

00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,649
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MAJOR 

1334
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:38,916
QUESTION.

1335
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,751
NOT JUST FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE 

1336
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:41,818

00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,655
REMARKS ON THE ISSUE OF MENTAL 

1339
00:43:45,655 --> 00:43:47,491
ILLNESS AS IT RELATES TO THESE 

1340
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,892
MASS SHOOTINGS.

1341
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,160
THAT IS SOMETHING HE TOUCHED ON 

1342
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,962
IN A TWEET THIS MORNING.

1343
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,330
WE HEARD THAT TWEET RIGHT THERE 

1344
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,033
ON YOUR SCREEN, THE PRESIDENT 

1345
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,167
SAYING SO MANY SIGNS THAT THE 

1346
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,103
FLORIDA SHOOTER WAS MENTALLY 

1347
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,370
DISTURBED.

1348
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,537
THIS IS AN ECHO WE HEARD FROM 

1349
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,873
THE DELEGATION IN FLORIDA.

1350
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,374
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA SAYING 

1351
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:05,475
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS 

1352
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:07,644
SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS.

1353
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,513
ROBIN, ONE OF THE THINGS GOING 

1354
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,081
FORWARD THAT THIS WHITE HOUSE 

1355
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,515
WILL BE CONFRONTED WITH IS THE 

1356
00:44:12,515 --> 00:44:14,718
FACT THAT ONE OF THE OTHER MAJOR

1357
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,386
ACTIONS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

1358
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:20,557
TAKEN ON GUN CONTROL IS TO BLOCK

1359
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,626
AN OBAMA-ERA RULE THAT MADE IT 

1360
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,927
HARDER FOR THE MENTALLY ILL TO 

1361
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,763
HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS AND THIS IS 

1362
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,163
A PRESIDENT WHO HAS NOT WANTED 

1363
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:28,599
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF GUN 

1364
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,032
CONTROL.

1365
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:33,270
HE HAS SAID IT IS TOO SOON TO DO

1366
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,539
SO PARTICULARLY WHEN AN 

1367
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,406
INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING.

1368
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:40,077
BUT WE ARE HEARING NOT JUST FROM

1369
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,212
PEOPLE IN FLORIDA, PERHAPS, WE 

1370
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:42,913

00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,247

THE TREASURY SECRETARY NOT LONG 

1373
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:48,718
AGO SAYING THAT PERSONALLY I 

1374
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,853
THINK GUN VIOLENCE IS A TRAGEDY 

1375
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,456
AND URGE CONGRESS TO LOOK AT 

1376
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,224
THESE ISSUES.

1377
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,426
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING A 

1378
00:44:56,426 --> 00:44:58,262
STATEMENT, A SENTIMENT EXPRESSED

1379
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,396
FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE

1380
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,265

WHERE THAT TRAGEDY TOOK PLACE.

1388
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:14,244
I DO KNOW FROM SOURCES HERE IN

1390
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,514

PRESIDENT MIGHT MAKE THAT VISIT 

1392
00:45:18,448 --> 00:45:19,583
THIS WEEKEND.

1393
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,451
AGAIN ROBIN, THE BIG QUESTION

CONTROL PERHAPS THIS IS THE 

1397
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,258
SHOOTING THAT WILL INSPIRE THEM 

1398
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,561
TO TAKE UP THIS POLICY 

1399
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,094
DISCUSSION.

1400
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:31,562

00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,497
ONE OF THE TRENDING HASHTAGS, 

1402
00:45:34,497 --> 00:45:36,099
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND OFTEN AFTER

1403
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:39,703
A SHOOTING LIKE THIS, IT'S TOO 

1404

UNDER THAT UMBRELLA AS WELL.

1444
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,673
WERE THERE WARNING SIGNS?

1445
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,341
THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT SAID 

1446
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,677
THEY HAD NO WARNING SIGNS.

1447
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,178
TODAY HE SAID HE COULDN'T TALK 

1448
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:56,046
ABOUT CRUZ'S RECORD.

HE WANTED TO SHOOT UP THE 

1453
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:02,051

00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:06,957
CARRIED BULLET CASINGS IN HIS 

1456
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,225
BOOK BAG.

1457
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,726
FOR SOME REASON THIS CHILD WAS 

1458
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,828
ALLOWED TO COME TO SCHOOL AND 

1459
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,164

00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:46,630
SUPPORT.

1478
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,498
HE WAS GETTING SUPPORT AND HE 

1479
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,832
HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT 

1480
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:51,935
THE SHERIFF IS NOW OPENLY 

1481
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,037
TALKING ABOUT AND WE KNOW THAT 

1482
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,672
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS ABLE TO BUY 

1483
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,607
AN AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE.

1484
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:59,343
THE SYSTEM DID NOT BLINK RED.

1485
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,277
HOW COULD YOU HAVE A YOUNG MAN 

1486
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:02,712
WHO HAD THESE KIND OF ISSUES 

1487
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:04,147
THEN GET THE WEAPON?

1488
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,016
THAT'S THE CRITICAL ISSUE.

1489
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,484
THE SHERIFF MADE A MAJOR POINT 

1490
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,952
ABOUT A CONVERSATION ABOUT 

1491
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,854
SOCIAL MEDIA.

1492
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,622
SHOULD WHEN PEOPLE POST 

1493
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,524
EXTREMELY VIOLENT IMAGES AND 

1494
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,026
STATEMENTS ONLINE, SHOULD THE 

1495
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,594
AUTHORITIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO 

1496
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,364
GO GET THOSE PEOPLE AND GET THEM

1497
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,632
BEFORE PROFESSIONALS TO EVALUATE

1498
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:22,832
THEM.

1499
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:23,800
THESE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS 

1500
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,202
WE'RE HAVING NOW.

1501
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,037
THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS I 

1502
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,638
WAS STRUCK WHEN THEY SAID 

1503
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:29,840
THERE'S STILL BODIES INSIDE THAT

1504
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,007
SCHOOL AND I THINK WE ALL NEED 

1505
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:32,609
TO KEEP THAT IN MIND TODAY. 

1506
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,977
>> AND THAT'S WHAT ALL THE 

1507
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,312
OFFICIALS THERE WERE SAYING.

1508
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,546
THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE WANT TO 

1509
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,582
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS 

1510
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:38,849
POSSIBLE.

1511
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,318
AND THE FAMILIES THAT'S HOW THEY

1512
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,853
BEGAN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THE 

1513
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:46,590
FAMILIES NOW HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.

1514
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,992
MANY OF THE STUDENTS, THEY 

1515
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,527
DIDN'T HAVE ANY ID ON THEM AND 

1516
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,229
WE DO NEED TO KEEP THE FAMILIES 

1517
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,964
IN OUR HEARTS AND MINDS.

1518
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,633
DAVID MUIR HAS MADE HIS WAY DOWN

1519
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:57,200
THERE TO FLORIDA.

1520
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,269
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE 

1521
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,639
BROADCASTING THERE FROM TONIGHT 

1522
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,473
DAVID.

1523
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,607
>> ROBIN IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO 

1524
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:06,543
KEEP THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE OF 

1525
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,744
WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS NOW 

1526
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:09,646
WITNESSED IN THE LAST FIVE TO 

1527
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,013
SIX MONTHS.

1528
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,382
THREE OF THE DEADLIEST MASS 

1529
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,484
SHOOTINGS IN MODERN AMERICAN 

1530
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:14,684
TIMES.

1531
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:15,985
IT'S SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY TO 

1532
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:18,822
THINK WE'RE ON THE SCENE IN 

1533
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,791
PARKLAND, FLORIDA AFTER BEING IN

1534
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,325
TEXAS, THE WORST CHURCH SHOOTING

1535
00:49:22,325 --> 00:49:24,194
IN MODERN TIMES.

1536
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,762
AFTER LAS VEGAS WHICH WE KNOW IS

1537
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,465
NOW THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR HOW 

1538
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,167
DEADLY THAT SCENE WAS.

1539
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,735
HERE IN FLORIDA, THE STORIES 

1540
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,535
THAT YOU HEAR FROM THESE 

1541
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:34,570
STUDENTS AND HOW COMMONPLACE 

1542
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,972
THIS HAS BECOME IN THIS COUNTRY.

1543
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,307
ABOUT THE DRILL THAT HAPPENED 

1544
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,809
EARLIER IN THE DAY AND SO WHEN 

1545
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,378
THEY HEARD THE FIRE ALARM PULLED

1546
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,345
AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S BELIEVED THE 

1547
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:43,747
SUSPECT PULLED THAT ALARM TO TRY

1548
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,282
TO GET TO KIDS AND TEACHERS TO 

1549
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,416
RACE OUT OF THE CLASSROOMS DOWN 

1550
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,052
THE HALLWAYS, THAT THEY THOUGHT 

1551
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:49,986
IT WAS A LITTLE ODD TO HEAR THAT

1552
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,821
ALARM ALL OVER AGAIN, BUT SO IN 

1553
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:54,658
MANY SCHOOLS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY

1554
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,191
HAVE BEEN TRAINING THEIR 

1555
00:49:55,191 --> 00:49:56,859
STUDENTS WITH DRILLS, ADDITIONAL

1556
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:58,428
PRACTICE ON WHAT TO DO IN THESE 

1557
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,830
TYPES OF SITUATIONS.

1558
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,265
IT'S BECOME SO COMMONPLACE AND 

1559
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,667
PRESIDENT OBAMA FACED THIS ISSUE

1560
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,469
BEFORE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AND

1561
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,769
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING 

1562
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:08,438
THIS ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE IN 

1563
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,007
OUR SCHOOLS AND IN OUR 

1564
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:11,307
COMMUNITIES.

1565
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:12,575
NOW SEVERAL TIMES JUST SINCE 

1566
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:13,276
BECOMING PRESIDENT.

1567
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,645
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SCRUTINY 

1568
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,848
NOW ON WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO

1569
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,450
SAY A SHORT TIME AGO CHOOSING TO

1570
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,284
CONCENTRATE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND

1571
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,385
I DON'T THINK IN ANY OF THESE 

1572
00:50:22,385 --> 00:50:23,753
COMMUNITIES YOU'LL FIND AN 

1573
00:50:23,753 --> 00:50:24,988
ARGUMENT THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS 

1574
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,690
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS TO BE

1575
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,726
LOOKED AT BUT THERE IS ANOTHER 

1576
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:30,994
VITAL COMPONENT AND THAT IS THE 

1577
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,662
WEAPONS BEING USED.

1578
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,732
IN THIS CASE, THE WEAPON IS 

1579
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,267
BELIEVED WAS PURCHASED LEGALLY 

1580
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,368
BUT THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS 

1581
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,004
ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN'S PAST, 

1582
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,039
WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD HAVE 

1583
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,174
HAD A WEAPON AND THE MULTIPLE 

1584
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,709
WARNING SIGNS THAT ARE BEGINNING

1585
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,411
TO EMERGE ABOUT HIS PAST AND 

1586
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:49,179
WHETHER OR NOT A COMMUNITY COULD

1587
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,680
HAVE PUT UP RED FLAGS FAR 

1588
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,148
EARLIER AND TRY TO PREVENT 

1589
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:52,983
ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THIS.

1590
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,118
BUT ROBIN, IT'S SOMETHING TO BE 

1591
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,352
AGAIN IN A COMMUNITY HERE IN 

1592
00:50:56,352 --> 00:50:58,321
AMERICA SO QUICKLY AFTER THOSE 

1593
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,624
OTHER PLACE THAT IS WE HAVE BEEN

1594
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,758
REPORTING ON YET AGAIN ALL OF 

1595
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,660
THESE FAMILIES WHO THOUGHT THEIR

1596
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,094
CHILDREN WOULD BE COMING HOME 

1597
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:08,565
FROM SCHOOL, GOING TO SPORTS 

1598
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,835
PRACTICE AND INSTEAD THEY WAITED

1599
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,102
TO HEAR IF THEIR CHILDREN'S 

1600
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,036
NAMES WERE ON THAT LIST. 

1601
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:16,606
>> WE TALKED TO MANY STUDENTS ON

1602
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,676
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA" AND ONE 

1603
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:20,310
STUDENT IN PARTICULAR STRUCK US 

1604
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,778
WHEN HE SAID WE CAN'T GET USED 

1605
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,080
TO THIS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE 

1606
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,216
NAMING ALL THE TIMES THAT 

1607
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:26,849
PRESIDENTS AND NOT JUST 

1608
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:28,384
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD TO BUT 

1609
00:51:28,384 --> 00:51:30,987
HIS PREDECESSORS HAVE HAD TO GO 

1610
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,855
DOWN TO THESE MEMORIALS AND TO 

1611
00:51:32,855 --> 00:51:35,191
HEAR THIS YOUNG MAN SAY IS 

1612
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:36,559
SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT GET 

1613
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,961
USED TO.

1614
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:38,562
THANK YOU, DAVID.
