good morning everyone how is everyone doing today all right that sounds like you're not doing too well how's everyone doing today yes yes all right it is an honor to be here with two revolutionary individuals when it comes to the topic of health and health care Jeff Arnold and dr. oz I'm sure you guys are all very familiar with them and some of the work that they've done and today we're gonna talk about how technology can help us become healthier how can technology become a solution in our lifestyle to lead to better health and possibly even lower health costs now I want to start with a very basic question because you are very in touch with some of the health issues that plague not just countries like the United States but the entire world so for instance even though there is a giant market out there for health related technology or diet foods obesity or individuals being overweight is still a huge problem in fact it increases every year there are about 2 billion individuals throughout the world who are either overweight or obese and it seems as though certain methods and strategies that have been utilized so far haven't been working and that concerns me but I'm curious what concerns you I'll start with you Jeff well you know since you know back in 1998 you know started WebMD and my career has been focused on health literacy and so as all this information you know has become available through social media and other places that's still a major focus for us is how do you organize health information from allergies to women's health make sure the information is right all the time and bring it to the masses fascinating dr. oz what about you so obesity for me is about lack of control and when you don't feel like you're there designing your own destiny you have to look for other ways you can control your destiny and the most easily thing that you can control is the fork at the end of your arm that's scooping into the food and when you combine that with foods that are low in nutrients by high in calories you have a perfect storm for obesity but obesity is just emblematic of the larger addiction challenges we face around the world in the United States the number one cause of death in young adults like you number one cause of death it's not car accidents it's it's actually drug addiction and opioid abuse and we are seeing that in other countries as well whether it's from alcohol the related elements we have suicide rates that are increasing and success rates of suicide increasing so the lack of control is our biggest challenge in the modern world which is ironic because all of us have these is you think this would give us control and partners I'm so passionate about technology and health is I think for the first time ever our species has the ability to control our health in a way that we never would have been vision prior to the evolution of the newer technologies but if we miss that window we'll see more obesity will see more chronic illnesses resulting obesity high blood pressure diabetes high cholesterol and that will bankrupt all Western nations because the United States cannot balance its budget no matter what party you are if we don't deal with those chronic issues the European Common Market countries can't either you end up ratcheting down the offering because you're not giving people more value and right now as a doctor I still operate there my show is in a hundred countries so good good chance of in your country but I still go to the operating room one day a week because I care so passionate about that experience I'm telling you from the inside there's no way for us to keep up we don't give you the message where you live but you don't meet you where you are in your home your living room in your bedroom so the Internet has democratized information and knowledge it's now widely available and people do have a little more control in regard to how they educate themselves how much they educate themselves WebMD has been an incredible example of that because people who didn't feel comfortable or didn't feel like they had the resources to maybe look into their conditions or look into the possible side effects of their drugs now had that information at their fingertips which is incra but we now have more knowledge more information than ever before yet our health continues to really struggle and I love that you mentioned opioid addiction because that is a problem plaguing the United States so why is there a disconnect why is it that we have more information than ever why is it that I have you know my Apple watch and I know that I should be standing more I should be running more I should be eating better but I can't do it so I have you starting ahead at the Jeff because Jeff spent half a billion dollars in ten years addressing this very issue the reason we don't have solutions is we have a balkanized way of delivering information everyone thinks they've got the best idea every insurance company has this approach every Hospital its approach every government their approach we need to have a fundamental platform we have banking platforms that are global we have media platforms my show can be seen by all those countries because it's the same platform but we don't have that in healthcare and that's not as easy as it would seem and all the big companies that you know about the the companies that are very very good at their core businesses the Google's the Microsoft's and the apples and the Amazons this is not a space they've been able to democratize because you have to be on the inside and when Jeff built WebMD it was web 1.0 version of this it was information but I'm here to say to you and if you're making content please hear me this is the most important thing I'll say people don't change based on what they know they change based on what they feel if you feel differently it'll work for you if you feel safe if you feel the information is yours and you get to use it and you can pull information in from everywhere because that's because you control it you'll trust it and you'll act on it and that led to share care which is a company that Oprah Winfrey who's my partner on the show asked me to create with Jeff she saw Jeff is the most powerful person in building platform businesses she knew that I didn't want to just talk on television I wanted to have it live in people's homes because we don't want you dying of a misprint right to make sure you heard it right so you built share care so what is share care so you know back in 1998 when digital health was just first taking off the tag line for WebMD was now health has a home page because even back then we realized that health care was so fragmented that it was hard for people to manage all these you know now wearables and websites at that time but it was a little bit too early right because people were just getting used to getting information not from their doctors when dr. oz and myself and others started to share care we said that it's not helped as a home page it's all your health in one place and what's different now is we all have the potentially the greatest healing device we've ever seen which is the smart phone in our pocket but we need to think about things differently we need to broadly define the user not only as a consumer but also as a patient as a help plan member as an employee and we have to build trust with that consumer they own the data not not the health plan and that they begin to earn trust with us as we start to connect all the important stakeholders of health to them when we connect those bridges we have to build value propositions that are for the person so getting the person to think not about health care from an episodic standpoint by thinking about it every day because now their doctor can communicate with them their employer can communicate with them their health plan can communicate with them so as consumerization takes off it's going to be this this movement that the persons in control and the person can go beyond just getting information so how does an individual gain control of their own life when they are struggling with something like a prescription drug addiction and you know there are you know various issues in various countries but just to focus on the United States since I'm most educated on the issues there opioid addiction is essentially a product of pharmaceutical companies pushing for the over prescription of painkiller drugs which are highly abusive and habit-forming so is there a way that you know your venture can can help alleviate that problem sure talk to that so the biggest challenge with chronic pain is it's not really well treated with opioids there has never been a good clinical trial showing chronic management of chronic pain works I'll say that again narcotics don't really work for chronic pain they build addiction but when you try to get off then may make it worse but what does work is physical activity some foods help some Eastern it's an alternative approaches meditation so if you could use those and feel comfortable that over-the-counter pill like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can work better maybe long term than narcotics you'll start to use them but who's gonna tell you that you know if the only time your insurance company or the government or your employer talks to you and you have a problem you're not gonna believe them the big breakthrough idea for me and share care was I can touch you every day in ways that you don't have to work hard to do as an example we have a a-and a device on the on the app that analyzes the stress in your voice does fractal analysis of your voice we actually used it in the last American election to compare Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump when people heard them what did they feel how many of you have been in a fight with your loved one they say it's not what you said it's how you said it I'm not the only one thank you everyone so this device tells you that so when you're talking to your boss or your employee or your spouse or your child your mother what did they hear in your voice what stress did they feel I can use that now with Jeff and share care and I could begin to say because of how you're sounding I know this is what you're going through and I can now give you view messages when you're best able to hear them so remember I can tell you lots of things but if you're not ready to hear it if you're struggling to get through the line to get into this building you don't want to be texted about your narcotic addiction maybe you maybe you have the opposite promise cigarette smoking if someone is stressed out if you tell them to stop smoking they get anxious they smoke more yes so right so you want to be able to communicate with people when they're mentally ready but you also want to know things about people that we already can tell that they don't know about I have a question in regard to what you just said because it really spoke to me not in regards to smoking but an example that I've personally experienced has to do with my husband encouraging me to meditate more because my stress levels are out of control and the more he tells me to meditate the angrier I get the more stressed out I get because I feel like meditating even if it's just for 10 minutes a day takes too much time it's taking too much time out of moments where I could be productive in my career and my job and so it's a cultural thing because I live in a society that says you need to work work work work work every that you're awake needs to be a productive minute how do you fight against that cultural standard I meditate because it makes me work more efficiently I sleep eight hours a night because the 16 hours that I'm awake I'll do 20 hours of work what share care I'll turn it to Jeff does is nudge you when you're ready to hear that message because if you're not ready to hear why am I wasting your time this gets to the psychology of change but if I can nudge you when you're ready to hear and tell you what your cost of your medications are so you can get the cheapest versions tell you the best doctor to help you with whatever problem you are if I can set it ease your concerns about who's gonna be taking care of your parents then all of a sudden it opens up a little bit of a window for you so you see life as it should be and that's the challenge you mentioned the word stress it is the number one killer but we've not been able to address it now we finally have some solutions it's not just share care but it's platform businesses like this that let all of you build tools to cobble onto if you've got four wheels and a chassis you can drive you have to build a body all of you out that's why I came I stopped taping this week to join Jeff here because you're the brains they're gonna make this a beautiful automobile and with you building on the little elements that have to exist you will have a place to put them for the first time Jeff in I think it's a combination of high-tech and high-touch so decision support helps people navigate the healthcare system so how can I speak into the app and say I have a migraine so instead of fumbling through search and not knowing what questions to ask we ask you questions and as you answer them we do pattern recognition against the latest peer-reviewed literature in less than three minutes I can take your chief complaint and give you a likely cause geo locates you and then navigate you to the right care we have 750 nurses that we employ at share care and those 750 nurses because of technology we'll be able to take care of 40 million people and so how through asynchronous messaging secure voice secure text secure video and secure file can you start to build a cadence with that patient because now we're with them 24/7 so whatever the issue may be on that person having access to CAIR using technology I think is where we're gonna see some really big breakthroughs like if I could give you an example so Oprah who lives in Hawaii did a beautiful program for us when we launched in the summer and and in Hawaii most of the people who live there are now on our platform and a wise an important example for you because it said Island but it's an experiment at the same time and I've been all over the world to Sardinia Okinawa long a Loma Linda to Costa Rica places where people live a long long time they lived aged a hundred in these so-called blue zones four times more commonly than where you live what did they do differently we want to look at those ideas and Hawaii is the closest to a blue zone the longest-lived state in America and we want to develop these ideas what is the best way to communicate and cobble together your concepts but it's working there when we have the biggest insurance company the biggest employers working with the biggest platform all of a sudden people who are developing tools know where to put their tools and the customers don't have vendor fatigue you come up with the best idea in the world people don't know how to incorporate it into their balkanized system and programs like Hawaii work because they allow us for the first time the demonstrate will happen in the rest of the world now we're also in Brazil at least as Portuguese speaking right we'll be in Europe our goal is within the next 18 months to have 50 million people and and be in them in several other countries but that's a very achievable goal so we want you to send us your ideas to be part of the solution I wanted to finally end with one question that I'm sure a lot of people are curious about is there a cost to this app to do it do people have to pay in order to have it so you know we've scaled really fast so in the last five years we made 11 acquisitions we spent a half a billion dollars putting together this platform we've realized that you have to be fluent in three languages to be successful in creating not an app but a platform you get to be fluent in media no to content experiences should be the same need to be fluent in technology you know what's the difference between machine learning and AI and you need to be fluent in healthcare but most importantly you have to know that healthcare is local so what works in Brazil will be different than Hawaii even though it's on same platform and it has to be free to the person and so we're running lots of different risk management models to figure out how we can lower our healthcare costs so that can subsidize it to make it free for the consumer that's amazing thank you so much for the conversation Jeff Arnold and dr. oz I'm Ana Kasparian thank you for coming and listening to us
