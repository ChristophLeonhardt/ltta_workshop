1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,290
JAILS AND PRISONS THROUGHOUT
THE UNITED STATES ARE DOING

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,080
AWAY WITH FACE-TO-FACE
VISITATION AND REPLACING

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,550
FAMILY VISITS WITH TECHNOLOGY
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO EITHER

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,150
VIDEOCONFERENCE OR MAYBE EVEN
CALL IN TO SPEAK TO AN INMATE.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,880
THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE
AND THEY HAVE TO DO WITH

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,279
COST AND ALSO THE FUNCTIONALITY
OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS

7
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:35,680
PUT OUT THERE.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,360
THERE ARE MASSIVE CORPORATIONS
BEHIND THESE TECHNOLOGICAL

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,050
ADVANCEMENTS AND OFTENTIMES THEY
STAND TO MAKE BILLIONS OF

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,000
DOLLARS IN SWITCHING FROM
FACE-TO-FACE VISITATION TO

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,860
TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS OF KEEPING
IN TOUCH WITH THESE INMATES AND

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,640
IT'S A HUGE INDUSTRY.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,739
WHEN
IT COMES TO THE PRISON PHONE

14
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:14,840
SYSTEM, BRINGS IN $1.2 BILLION A
YEAR FOR THESE CORPORATIONS.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,460
NOT EVERY PRISON IS DOING THIS,
BUT THE TREND WILL ESSENTIALLY

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,399
CONVINCE YOU THAT MORE AND MORE
PRISONS ARE HEADED IN THAT

17
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,399
DIRECTION.

18
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,710
AN ANALYSIS FOUND
THAT AS MANY AS 600

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,209
JAILS AND PRISONS ARE THE UNITED
STATES HAVE ALREADY STARTED

20
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:31,439
IMPLEMENTING THIS TYPE OF
TECHNOLOGY.

21
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,709
NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE COMPLETELY
PHASED OUT FACE-TO-FACE

22
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,939
VISITATION BUT THEY ARE HEADED
IN THAT DIRECTION.

23
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:40,119
SO LET'S BREAK DOWN UPSIDES
AND DOWNSIDES.

24
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,209
A CLEAR UPSIDE IS HEY, A LOT OF
TIME THESE PRISONS ARE VERY

25
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,060
FAR FROM WHERE THE FAMILIES
LIVE.

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,850
TO BE ABLE TO SKYPE IN COULD BE
REALLY POSITIVE.

27
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,139
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT POSITIVE
STORY AND FIND A WAY TO

28
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:55,179
MAKE A SOUL CRUSHING.

29
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,850
CONGRATULATIONS, OUR PRISON
SYSTEM HAS.

30
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,869
NUMBER ONE, NOW YOU ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO SEE THEM IN PERSON.

31
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:07,179
BUT HAVEN'T WE CRUSHED OUR
PRISONERS ENOUGH?

32
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,330
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT SOME OF
THEM HAVE DONE TERRIBLE

33
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,150
THINGS BUT OTHER COUNTRIES
BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION.

34
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,250
WE IN AMERICA HAVE TOTALLY GIVEN
UP ON THAT CONCEPT BUT SOME

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,500
OF THEM ARE NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS
AND THEY SMOKED A JOINT AND

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,450
NOW, OH MY GOD, IF YOU DON'T
LISTEN TO THE GUARDS THERE,

37
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,720
GOD KNOWS WHAT THEY THINK, ETC.

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,900
THEN YOU ARE GOING TO GET

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,750
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND NOW
YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR LOVED

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,230
ONES AND IT JUST CRUSHES YOU AND
QUESTIONS YOU AND WHY?

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,530
TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION HERE IS WHY?

42
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,350
IS IT JUST TO BE GRATUITOUSLY
MORE DEMEANING TO ALL OF

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,950
OUR PRISONERS AND STRIP ANY
HUMANITY THEY HAVE?

44
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,730
NO, THAT'S A POSITIVE SIDE
EFFECT FOR THE EVIL PEOPLE

45
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,620
THAT RUN THESE PRISONS HONESTLY
IS EVERY WARDEN EVIL?

46
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
NO.

47
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,960
BUT THE SYSTEM OVERALL IS GROSS.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
IT IS.

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,070
THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE THERE
AND THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,560
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PRISONS
WHETHER THEY ARE PRIVATE

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,220
PRISONS WERE RUN BY THE STATE,
THEY STAND TO PROFIT FROM

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,720
IT BECAUSE THEY GET A
COMMISSION.

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,200
THEY GET A PORTION OF THE MONEY
MADE FROM THIS PHONE OR

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,280
VIDEO CONSEQUENCE IT IS NOT AN
ACCIDENT THAT THEY ARE

55
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,160
CUTTING OFF YOUR PERSONAL
VISITS.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,160
IT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT
TO CRUSH HER SOUL, THAT IS

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,630
THE SIDE EFFECTS AS I WAS
TELLING YOU.

58
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,160
THE MAIN REASON IS AND IT IS
ONLY GERMAN BY PROFIT.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,060
IF YOU CAN'T SEE THEM IN PERSON,
YOU MUST DO THESE CALLS AND

60
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,460
BY THE WAY, THE TELEPHONES ARE
ALSO INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE,

61
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,450
TELEPHONE CALLS FROM INSIDE
PRISONS THAT NIGHT HAVE A

62
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,710
SKYPE CALL IT IS EVEN MORE
EXPENSIVE.

63
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,030
YOU FORCE THEM INTO A PLACE
WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO

64
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,070
MAKE MORE PROFIT FOR THEM.

65
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,550
SOME OF THE PRISONS HAVE WAGES
FOR THE PRISONERS WHO WOULD

66
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,550
LIKE TO WORK.

67
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,180
AS HIGH AS A DOLLAR A DAY.

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,510
SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO WORK
13 DAYS, ALMOST 2

69
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,430
WEEKS STRAIGHT TO EARN ONE 20
MINUTES SKYPE CALL.

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,240
AND BY THE WAY, THE PEOPLE
WHO PAY FOR THOSE CALLS IN THE

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,451
BEGINNING AND INITIALLY ARE THE
FAMILY MEMBERS SO THE FAMILY

72
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:03,590
MEMBERS ARE NEEDLESSLY GETTING
PUNISHED WITH THIS FINANCIAL

73
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,650
BURDEN JUST TO KEEP IN TOUCH
WITH THEIR LOVED ONES WHO MIGHT

74
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,600
BE LOCKED AWAY FOR WHATEVER
REASON IN SOME CASES, CRIMINAL

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,060
BEHAVIOR, BUT AS WE KNOW, IN A
LOT OF CASES NONVIOLENT

76
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,930
OFFENDERS WHO END UP BEING
HARDENED CRIMINALS BECAUSE OF

77
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,670
THEIR PRISON SENTENCES AND BY
THE WAY, JUST KEEP IN MIND

78
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,300
THAT RECIDIVISM IS SOMETHING
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD CARE

79
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,220
ABOUT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO CONTINUOUSLY GO

80
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,080
BACK-AND-FORTH, GO TO JAIL, GET
OUT, GET INCARCERATED AGAIN

81
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,290
BECAUSE WE AS TAXPAYERS PAY FOR
THAT.

82
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,910
SO IF YOU CARE ABOUT OUR
RESOURCES BEING PUT TO GOOD USE,

83
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,780
WE SHOULD FOCUS ON DOING
WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO

84
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,650
DECREASE RECIDIVISM AND MAKE
SURE THAT THEY HAVE AN EASIER

85
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,040
TIME GETTING BACK INTO SOCIETY
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS

86
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,470
TO ENSURE THAT THEY STILL HAVE
REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR

87
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,690
LOVED ONES ON THE OUTSIDE AND
RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM THAT

88
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,090
WE HAVE SET UP IS OPTIMIZED FOR
RECIDIVISM.

89
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,581
AND LOOK, AGAIN, ACROSS THE
POLITICAL SPECTRUM, YOU

90
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,610
KNOW WHY THEY ARE DOING THIS.

91
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,550
THERE IS NO LACK OF CLARITY AT
ALL.

92
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,230
THEY'RE NOT EVEN PRETENDING IT
IS A SAFETY ISSUE OR ANY

93
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,240
OTHER ISSUE.

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
IT'S JUST YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO
SEE HER FAMILY ANYMORE SO

95
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,870
WE CAN CHARGE YOU MORE MONEY.

96
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,139
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING WITH OUR PRISONS.

97
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,070
THEY HAVE CREATED A LOT OF
PROFIT MOTIVES GUYS, TO PUT

98
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,140
MORE AND MORE OF US IN PRISON.

99
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,380
IT'S NOT JUST THE PRIVATE
PRISONS, IT'S EVEN IF

100
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,550
YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC PRISON, THEY
GET TO MAKE MONEY OFF YOU

101
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,160
BY DOING SCAMS LIKE THIS SO IF
YOU CREATED A PROFIT MOTIVE FOR

102
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,810
PUTTING PEOPLE IN PRISON, WHAT
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE?

103
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,380
MORE PRISONERS AND THAT
IS WHY AMERICA HAS A

104
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:52,490
RECORD-BREAKING RATE OF
PRISONERS.

105
00:05:52,490 --> 00:06:08,470
WE INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN

106
00:06:08,470 --> 00:00:00,000
THE WORLD, PERIOD.
