00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:01,303
CAPITOL HILL INVOLVING HOUSE

2
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:02,204
REPUBLICANS, THEIR EFFORT TO

3
00:00:02,204 --> 00:00:05,107
STRENGTHEN FOOD STAMP WORK

4
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:07,109
REQUIREMENTS, AND THE PUSH TO

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:09,077
RESOLVE LINGERING ISSUES OVER

6
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:09,711
IMMIGRATION.

7
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,512
CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL

8
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,513
CORRESPONDENT MIKE EMANUEL

9
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:13,782
TONIGHT ON THE TACTICS IN THE

10
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:14,283
STRATEGY.

11
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:15,083
>> Reporter: THERE COULD NOT

12
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,852
BE A BETTER TIME TO TAKE ACTION

13
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:19,154
TO HELP MORE PEOPLE JOIN OUR

14
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:19,521
WORKFORCE.

15
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,555
>> PART OF THE HOUSE SPEAKER'S

16
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:22,991
PITCH FOR SUPPORT OF A FIVE-YEAR

17
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,326
FARMVILLE EXTENSION.

18
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:25,127
BUT AS G.O.P. LEADERS TRY TO

19
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:27,329
ROUND UP THE FINAL VOTES TO PASS

20
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,564
IT, DOWNSTREAM CAUCUSES TRYING

21
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:31,733
TO FLEX SOME MUSCLE ON

22
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:32,401
IMMIGRATION IN EXCHANGE FOR

23
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,335
SUPPORT ON THE FARM BILL.

24
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,137
>> THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR

25
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:36,238
MEMBERS BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE A

26
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:37,839
VOTE ON IMMIGRATION BEFORE WE

27
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:40,175
HAVE A VOTE ON THE FARM BILL.

28
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:41,610
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONVINCE ANY

29
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,749
OF OUR MEMBERS TO GO FROM NO TO

30
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:48,850
YES ON THE FARM BILL.

31
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,484
SO WE WILL HAVE FURTHER

32
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:52,888
DISCUSSIONS TONIGHT WITH

33
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:53,288
LEADERSHIP.

34
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:55,490
AT THIS POINT, THERE IS NO DEAL

35
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,758
TO BE MADE.

36
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:57,959
>> Reporter: THIS COMES AS A

37
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:58,660
MODERATE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE

38
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,463
TRYING TO FORCE RYAN'S HAND ON

39
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:02,931
AN IMMIGRATION BILL BY BEING

40
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:04,700
WILLING TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS.

41
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,234
AT LEAST 20 REPUBLICANS HAVE

42
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,704
SIGNED ON TO THE SO CARGO

43
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:09,504
DISCHARGE PETITION AND RYAN HAS

44
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:11,173
TRIED TO HOLD HIM OFF BY SAYING

45
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,374
HE WANTS AN IMMIGRATION PLAN

46
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,075
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BE

47
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,710
WILLING TO SIGN.

48
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,878
>> WE WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN DO

49
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,413
OUR OWN IMMIGRATION BILL, SO

50
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,750
EVEN LABORING TO GET NUMBER 218,

51
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,252
IT'S CLEAR WE DON'T HAVE THAT AS

52
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:24,586
A BILL.

53
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:29,091
>> NANCY PELOSI CALLED THE

54
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:29,658
ACTION VERY BEAUTIFUL.

55
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:33,929
>> RANK AND FILE, AND EVEN

56
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:35,297
REALLY MORE ESTABLISHING THOSE

57
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:36,932
MEMBERS THAT HAVE IN THE HOUSE

58
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:38,200
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SIDE

59
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,735
HAVE COME TOGETHER ON A

60
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:41,970
BIPARTISAN BILL, THAT THEY HAVE

61
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,972
CONSTRUCTED, THAT THEY HAVE

62
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:45,340
GAINED SUPPORT FOR, AND THAT

63
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,810
THEY HAVE NOW MADE PART OF THE

64
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,344
DISCHARGE PETITION.

65
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:50,712
>> CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT AMUSED

66
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:52,347
BY MODERATES MAKING THIS PLAY AT

67
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,548
OUR SIGNALING WHAT THEY WANT.

68
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,550
THE IDEA OF BEING SOMETHING

69
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,452
CLOSE TO A SECURITY FIRST PLAN

70
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:01,423
OFFERED BY JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN,

71
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:01,823
BOB GOODLAD.

72
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:03,859
>> THE FIX IS WE HAVE TO KEEP

73
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,361
COMPROMISING AND FIND THE SWEET

74
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,930
SPOT THAT WILL PASS INTO LAW.

75
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,664
>> FOX HAS LEARNED THAT G.O.P.

76
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,734
LEADERS PLAN TO OFFER THE

77
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,136
FREEDOM OF CAUCUS DATE NEXT

78
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:15,303
MONTH'S FOR THAT CONSERVATIVE

79
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,138
BILL.

80
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,406
IF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS DOESN'T

81
00:02:17,406 --> 00:00:00,000
TAKE IT, LEADERSHIP COULD PULL
