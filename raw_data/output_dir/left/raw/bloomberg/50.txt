1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,940
After decades of limiting families
to

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,630
just one child China

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,400
has a new message for couples.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,470
Please have another baby.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,030
Why the change of heart.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,280
In short China is aging

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,140
and losing its working population.

8
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,200
Although China changed its rules in
2016

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,450
to allow couples to have as many as
two children.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,670
That hasn't convinced enough parents

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,529
to have more than one high living

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,450
costs. Long work hours

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,310
and surging child care expenses

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,289
means that many couples feel that
they can only

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,030
afford to have one child

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,050
or even none.

17
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,689
On top of that a study found that 33

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,969
percent of women had their pay cut
after

19
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,870
giving birth

20
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,540
and 36 percent were demoted.

21
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,809
If they want to reverse the
demographic

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,180
trends that they're

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,039
currently facing they will not only

24
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,149
have to deal

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,370
with the cost of having a child

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,130
they'll also be fighting against
demographic

27
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,169
and social trends in which people
are having

28
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,610
fewer and fewer children.

29
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,769
To counter that trend the Government
is

30
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,689
considering lifting all limits on
the

31
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,490
number of children a family can have

32
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,560
otherwise by 2040

33
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,359
one quarter of the world's most
populous

34
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,700
country will be 65

35
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,529
or older which threatens an

36
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,299
economic boom that's been built on a
vast

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,530
labor supply.

38
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,800
Countries don't usually become Great
Powers

39
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,059
when they're old

40
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,330
and graying they become Great Powers

41
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,190
when they're young and vigorous.

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,939
And if Xi Jinping wants to complete

43
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,099
that transition he may

44
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,530
need to build a younger country

45
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,180
that can pull it off.

46
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,950
How did we get here

47
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,469
after the creation of the People's
Republic of

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,030
China in 1949.

49
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,709
The government train tens of
thousands

50
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,870
of quote barefoot doctors

51
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,760
to bring healthcare to poor

52
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,780
and rural areas.

53
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,480
The result. Mortality rates
plummeted

54
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,860
and the population growth rates
skyrocketed.

55
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,099
By the 1970s China was

56
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,090
facing food

57
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,260
and housing shortages.

58
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,050
In 1979 its leader

59
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,999
Deng Xiaoping decided to

60
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,400
limit most couples to just one
child.

61
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,540
And it worked.

62
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,119
The average births per woman dropped
to

63
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,010
less than 2.

64
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,209
However there was a social
consequence

65
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,609
to this the traditional preference

66
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,799
among Chinese parents for sons

67
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,569
caused many parents to abort female

68
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,710
fetuses.

69
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,020
The imbalance grew to the point
where there were

70
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,639
120 men for every

71
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
100 women.

72
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,420
Over time women became very picky

73
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,800
about possible husbands.

74
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,839
Some rural men began to buy wives

75
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,370
from human traffickers.

76
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,559
In early 2018 authorities

77
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,080
rescued 17 Vietnamese women

78
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,420
and arrested a gang of 60
traffickers

79
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,160
who had been selling women in China.

80
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,739
The change to allow two children was
meant

81
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,140
to fix the nation's demographic
problems.

82
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,299
But after an initial spike in the
birth

83
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,219
rate in 2016 the 2017

84
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,010
numbers didn't appear to be as
large.

85
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,109
The indications are that people
won't be

86
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,750
rushing out to have kids they may
see a temporary

87
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,700
bump in the number of children.

88
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,259
But whether that will be a lasting
change

89
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,269
that will affect China's demographic

90
00:02:57,930 --> 00:00:00,000
trajectory seems very much in doubt.
