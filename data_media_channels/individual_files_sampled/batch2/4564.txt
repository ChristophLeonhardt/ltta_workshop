we are showing you this now and as we do just getting word that the president apparently now has spoken publicly some words about Senator McCain we are scrambling to turn those words around to get you to them as soon as we have them should be momentarily meanwhile as we wait for that though the president also apparently had a change of heart when it came to that question of lowering the American flag to half-staff at the White House this morning it was referred was returned excuse me to full staff that wasn't a break of tradition of keeping the flag lowered until burial to honor the passing of other sitting senators but then this afternoon as that statement was released the president ordered the flag returned to half-staff American flag on Capitol Hill has remained at the half-staff position in honor of the man whose willingness to buck his party earned him the nickname maverick earlier today and a chance to speak to Ohio Governor John Kasich he was a friend of McCain's take a look Governor Kasich thank you for joining us the latest now is that the flag at the White House again flying at half-staff and the president putting out a statement saying despite our differences on policy and politics I respect Senator John McCain service to our country and in his honor have signed a proclamation to fly the flag at half-staff until the day of his interment of course that had not been the case until midway in middle of this afternoon what's your reaction to that news great great I'm glad that the White House has decided to do that and the president you know I'm pleased to see that he said we're gonna put the flags back down and and that he had kind words for for John McCain I think that's really good that's good positive what do you make of the delay I mean I think did practically any other administration I could think of it wouldn't have even been an issue I don't read people's minds I can just say that it's good that across this country there is an outpouring from everybody to say that we should honor the life of this of this great man a guy who's you know stood on principle he was able to laugh at himself he was able to reach out the people who he didn't agree with he was renowned all over the world I just I think he was incredible guy and I'm so thrilled to see the outpouring it's more than what I thought it would be and I there'd be an outpouring but boy it's it's international and people are celebrating the life of somebody who figured out a way to stand on principle and still be able to befriend people even those he didn't agree with you say it's more than you thought it would be why do you think that is I never can you can never really always figure out how human beings are gonna react I'm certainly didn't get a you know didn't get my psychology degree in the mail last week but I think that people are hungry for a sense of unity I think they're hungry for some peace in the valley you know look people are always attracted to the extremes on the left to the right you know when if you ever in a car and you're driving down the highway you know and the traffic slows down you think well there must be a traffic accident then by the time you get to where the slowdown is it's on the other side of the road right I mean it's like people are always attracted to these things that can have and as sort of a negative energy to them it's something about human nature but people don't want to live in those extremes people want to live where they can have peace and security and unity so while we may be attracted to the flash in the dash you know sort of like take a walk on the wild side you might remember that old song by Lou Reed the fact of the matter is we like to live where we can have peace where we can get along well we can when we can really care about one another and I think this is a moment where the world is catching its breath and saying thank God for a guy that showed us how to do it well so if John McCain showed the world how to do that he's not going to be obviously unfortunately a part of the political discourse going forward within your party within the Republican Party give me some names who is there to provide that example now this is not a time to be thinking about you know any of that this is a time to think about the life of John McCain and after a while if people are inspired appropriately because I think there's going to probably be a more of a series of books and and maybe a movie about his life because it's a compelling life that people would want to see that even though he's died his life ended well then he had his head high and was surrounded by his family and you know what comes that's for another day this is a week to reflect and think about what he has meant and and it may inspire not just people who were in public life today but it may get some of these young people to really be inspired and we need that we need people to say that I can make a difference no matter what I'm doing I can make a difference in the way the world turns and that would be I think the message of John McCain by the way who's also a faithful man I called John soon after he was diagnosed and I was concerned about him I said John what about you and the big guy he said Johnny does he always called me Johnny I you don't have to worry about that I'm I'm all squared away and so a man of faith the man who loved this country a man who loved his family and loved his friends and he could he could get in the ring and battle with the best of them but at the end he shook hands and and held his head high all right Ohio Governor John Kasich thank you for taking a few mistakes eneter John McCain was a decorated war veteran as we said an accomplished political maverick that was his reputation certainly as praised continues to pour in from across the nation and around the world one man as we said until this afternoon and again this evening had remained muted on this that was the president Donald Trump and of course there is a history here you are probably well aware of it the two of them first clashing when the Arizona senator criticized the then presidential candidate Trump for his characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals that back in 2015 Trump who according to the Washington Post continually said that McCain was not a friend then hit back at the senator he's not a war hero he's a war he's a war hero because he was captured I like people that weren't captured okay the background on that of course back in the spring of 1968 Donald Trump's son of a wealthy New York State real estate developer received the first in a series of what would turn out to be five deferments from the war in Vietnam meanwhile at the same time it was a young captain McCain who was beaten within an inch of his life while in captivity in Vietnam The Washington Post also reporting that the president continues to believe privately the McCain was not a hero for more joined by Susan page USA Today Washington bureau chief George F will syndicated columnist and MSNBC contributor thanks to both of you for being with us and I mentioned again the President had been muted I said at the top of the broadcast were getting word that at this hour the president in fact is hosting some evangelical leaders at the White House he just told them according to our reporting that quote our hearts and prayers are going out to the family of Senator John McCain and we very much appreciate everything Senator McCain has done for our country so the president apparently telling that just now to evangelical leaders in the White House putting out that statement this afternoon offering his his respect for the late Senator but Susan page it is interesting it was nearly 48 hours after news of John McCain's passing that the president took this new shift in in tone here there had been a day basically a day of advance warning from the McCain family that this was happening I think safe to say I can't think of another leader in either party who in Trump's position right now as president would have had this delay what do you make of it I I think it's I think it's inexplicable it does no damage at all to John McCain it does damage only to President Trump by having having this sort of delay for someone who is of course an American hero and someone who served the nation in the military and in the Senate I think it's remarkable it took this long to get him to do even the kind of cursory statement you just read honoring senator McCain's service and I wonder if it was the almost universal outrage including by the American Legion this afternoon that finally persuaded the president that he should take this step in also lower the flags to half staff until the burial on Sunday and George will in that interview with Governor Kasich he said he was surprised by the level of the outpouring here at John McCain's passing I I do wonder he didn't offer an opinion on this but I wonder if you would is is there an instinct there and on the part of some folks who are mourning a Senator McCain right now to connect the example of his life his story we talked about the contrast there in the Vietnam era to that of the current president I think that's right I think the president's behavior not admirable but I disagree with Susan I think is entirely explicable mr. Trump is a man of desperate and transparent and obvious insecurities and for a man like that he is after all a weak person's idea of a strong person the life of John McCain is a front-to-back a reproach to the kind of life that's been led by by mr. Trump so I think there's been a tension there I kind of almost chemical repelling from between the two of them and it persists as you would expect with mr. Trump into the realm of bad taste I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
