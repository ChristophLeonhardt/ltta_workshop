1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,959
— The days leading up to
Jeff Sessions’ DACA announcement

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,780
were doubly anxious for Luis Cortes Romero.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,680
Not only is he an immigration attorney
with DACA clients,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,000
he’s also a DACA recipient himself.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,420
Before Cortes turned 2-years-old,

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,360
his parents left Michoacán, Mexico,

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,439
and migrated without papers to California,

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,180
where they still live today.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,320
He grew up in the San Francisco Bay area,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,840
playing in punk bands and exploring his Mexican roots,

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,640
but feeling, always, like an American kid.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,420
— Do you remember Mexico at all?

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:43,940
— I do not.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,700
I do not.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,680
And so, I imagine Mexico how anybody else
would imagine it who has never been there.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,780
And so, it’s interesting because some of
my peers who were born here, raised here,

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,230
will tell me more about Mexico than I know about it,

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,200
and have experienced more of Mexico than I have.

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,720
— Cortes was in law school in Idaho
when Obama announced DACA in 2012.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Before DACA, he wasn’t sure what
he would do with his law degree,

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,880
but figured it would improve his opportunities.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,740
It was DACA that allowed him to start working
at a law firm as soon as he graduated,

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,020
and five years later, he landed his first high-profile case:

24
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,400
Daniel Ramirez Medina,

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,200
the first DACA recipient detained
under the Trump administration.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,349
— Characterize for me what it’s going
to mean if this goes away.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,680
— I think it’s going to be devastating.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
It’s going to feel like such a loss.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,240
In so many different ways.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,480
And that loss is going to be coupled
with a tremendous amount of fear.

31
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,820
— We are the immigrants!

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,740
— We are the immigrants!

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,380
— The mighty, mighty immigrants!

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,380
— DACA has a lot of moving parts,

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,460
but it essentially does two things:

36
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,480
It promises young undocumented immigrants

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,340
with a high school diploma
and no significant criminal record

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,100
that they will not be deported for two years.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,400
And, in that same period, it gives them work permits.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,860
Even though they pay into Social Security,

41
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,080
DACA recipients are not eligible for Medicaid,

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,800
financial aid for college, or any other federal benefits.

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,720
— Of course not.

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,220
Of course not.

45
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,960
— On Tuesday morning,

46
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,260
shortly before Sessions made his announcement,

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,900
Cortes met with Cinthia Gutierrez,

48
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,500
a DACA recipient who lives just outside Seattle.

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,980
— Where you are working at now,

50
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,980
is that something that they have brought up?

51
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,780
Like, have they brought up your work permit before?

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,980
— I did tell them, like, “Hey, this is going on,”

53
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,700
“if this does end up happening,” you know…

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,260
“I might not be able to work anymore.”

55
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,000
The owner just told me, like, “Don’t worry about it,”

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,180
“we’ll worry about it when it gets here.”

57
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,260
“I really don’t want to lose you
as an employee, you’re valued here.”

58
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,300
I was just like, “Well, I kinda wanted
to mention it, because… it worries me.”

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,200
— No, yeah. Yeah.
— It scares me.

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,800
— When the time came for
Sessions to deliver his statement,

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,860
Cortes watched from a reception area in his office.

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,680
— The effect of this unilateral executive amnesty,

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,860
among other things,

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,340
contributed to a surge of minors
at the southern border…

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,080
— Oh my fucking God.

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,760
— …that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences.

67
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,380
It also denied jobs to hundreds
of thousands of Americans…

68
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,040
— What this announcement creates is a time bomb.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,220
It’s a time bomb for Congress to act,

70
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,320
otherwise people are going to start
falling from this program—

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,100
whether in six months or, you know,
whatever that looks like.

72
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,660
It leaves all of these Dreamers, their lives,

73
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,820
in the hands of political parties
that they have no participation in.

74
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,120
And that’s a very, very scary thing.

75
00:03:59,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Fuck.
