ARTHEL: LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> FOR ANDREW IT'S BEEN AN
INTERESTING DAY BECAUSE AS YOU
PROBABLY HEARD, I SAID A LITTLE
BIT EARLIER FROM A TURKISH
PRISON TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN 24
HOURS, THAT'S NOT BAD.
>> AND I WANT TO START BY SAYING
THAT MARINE WAS UNBELIEVABLE, HE
WAS CALLING AND CALLING, SHE
DEFINITELY LOVES YOU, LET ME PUT
IT THAT WAY.
>> SHE WAS CALLING AND SHE
WANTED YOU OUT.
SHE WAS NOT PLAYING GAMES,
RIGHT?
AND WE ARE PROUD OF YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.
AND YOU ARE VERY, VERY SPECIAL
TO ALL OF US AND, YOU KNOW, WE
HAVE SOME OF OUR GREAT LEADERS
RIGHT HERE, YOU KNOW JAMES, YOU
KNOW CINDY, YOU KNOW RICHARD,
YOU KNOW TOM, YOU KNOW PATRICK,
YOU KNOW MARK AND ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE, THE WHOLE GROUP OF
PEOPLE, THEY FOUGHT SO HARD FOR
YOU, THEY WANTED YOU OUT AND,
AGAIN, WE HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING
LONG AND HARD.
WE DO NOT PAY RANSOM IN THIS
COUNTRY, AT LEAST ANY LONGER, WE
WON'T PAY RANSOM OTHERWISE
YOU'LL HAVE BIG PROBLEMS AND
LOTS OF THINGS WILL HAPPEN, LOTS
OF BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN, BUT I
STILL I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT
ERDOGAN, WE HAVE BEEN DEALING
AND UNTIL THIS WE HAD A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP, I WAS SURPRISED
THAT WE DIDN'T WORK THIS OUT A
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, BUT IT
STARTED IN A DIFFERENT
ADMINISTRATION AND THEY WERE NOT
GOING TO WORK OUT ANYTHING AND
WE TOOK IT OVER AND INHERIT IT
AND WE HAVE I THINK AT THIS
MOMENT GOTTEN 19 DIFFERENT
PEOPLE OUT OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES
THAT WERE BEING HELD.
CHAIRMAN KIM WAS REALLY GREAT TO
US, I THINK THAT STARTED THE
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE NOW IN
NORTH KOREA WITH 3 HOSTAGES AS
YOU KNOW.
EGYPT, WE HAD IA, THEY SAID A
SPY, SHE WAS SENTENCED TO 25
YEARS, THEY TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA
WE WILL NOT LET HER OUT UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY TOLD
ME SHE'LL BE IN THE OVAL OFFICE
IN 24 HOURS.
YOU GUYS WORKED ON THAT ONE TOO
AND MANY OTHERS, MANY OTHERS.
SO I JUST WANT TO CONGRATULATE
YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE GALVANIZED
THIS COUNTRY.
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, THERE'S
SO MUCH INTEREST AND IT'S YOUR
FAITH, YOUR STRENGTH, WHAT YOU
HAVE GONE THROUGH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH AND I ALSO
KNOW THAT A PERIOD OF TIME AGO
WE WERE ABLE TO GET YOU FROM
PRISON TO THE HOUSE.
IT'S NOT AN EASY SITUATION FOR
TURKEY EITHER.
THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF DIFFICULT
SITUATIONS GOING ON AND I DO
WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT ERDOGAN
FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE.
YOU UNDERSTAND BY THAT, IT
WASN'T EASY AND WASN'T EASY FOR
HIM, MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO
CONGRATULATE YOU AND YOUR LIFE.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW
WORDS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO THANK
GREAT LEADERS, THEY WERE CALLING
ME A LOT, TOO MUCH, OKAY, WE ARE
WORKING ON IT.
THEY ARE TERRIFIC FANS OF YOURS
AND RIGHT NOW THE WHOLE WORLD IS
A FAN OF YOURS, THE WHOLE WORLD
IS A FAN, MAYBE SAY A FEW WORDS,
INTRODUCE YOUR FAMILY AND IT'S A
GREAT HONOR TO HAVE YOU BACK
HOME.
>> THANK YOU.
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER JACQUELINE,
MY SON AND OTHER SON JORDAN AND
MY WIFE.
>> WE ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK
THE ADMINISTRATION, YOU REALLY
FOUGHT FOR US UNUSUALLY FROM THE
TIME YOU TOOK OFFICE.
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
ENGAGED AND SECRETARY OF STATE
POMPEO WAS VERY ENGAGED AND
FOUGHT FOR US AND VICE PRESIDENT
PENCE, WE ARE GRATEFUL.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN
THE SENATE AND I CAN'T MENTION
EVERYONE BUT I KNOW THAT SENATOR
TILLIS VISIT IN PRISON AND SO
DID SENATOR GRAHAM AND SENATOR
LANKFORD WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, WE ARE
SO GRATEFUL TO SO MANY PEOPLE IN
CONGRESS WHO STOOD WITH US AND
PRAYED FOR US AND FOUGHT FOR US,
SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY
MUCH.
>> I DO HAVE TO SAY WE DID LEAVE
OUT MANY PEOPLE IN THE SENATE,
MANY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE, YOU
KNOW THAT PATRICK, MANY PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND WE JUST
CAN'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THE
NAMES BUT IT WAS EVERYBODY WHO
WANTED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, THE
COMPLETE SENATE, I THINK WE CAN
PROBABLY SAY, RICHARD, THIS WAS
BIPARTISAN, DO YOU AGREE?
THIS WASN'T JUST REPUBLICAN,
RIGHT?
BUT HONESTLY IF THERE WAS EVER A
BIPARTISAN EVENT THIS WAS IT AND
I DO HAVE TO THANK VICE
PRESIDENT PENCE.
HE'S DOING A TERRIFIC JOB.
HE FELT VERY, VERY STRONGLY
ABOUT THIS AND SECRETARY OF
STATE POMPEO, I WOULD SAY WE
SPOKE ABOUT THIS AT LEAST ONCE A
DAY.
>> YES, SIR.
>> WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT DONE 2
MONTHS AGO, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK OUT, I CAN ONLY TELL
YOU IT'S BETTER THAN ANYBODY
ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE.
YOU ARE GOING TO GO AND RELAX
AND GO HOME AND CELEBRATE AND
HAVE A GREAT LIFE, RIGHT?
I WON'T ASK YOU WHETHER OR NOT
YOU ARE GOING BACK TO TURKEY.
>> WE DO LOVE TURKEY, WE WERE
THERE FOR 25 YEARS, WE LOVE THE
TURKISH PEOPLE.
>> THAT'S VERY NICE.
>> WE PRAY FOR THEIR BLESSING.
>> THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
I KNOW THAT.
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
>> WE WOULD PRAY FOR YOU AND
PRAY AS A FAMILY MY WIFE AND I.
>> WELL, I NEED IT MORE THAN
ANYBODY.
THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> OKAY.
SO YOU CAN --
>> I ASK THAT YOU SHOW US YOUR
HOLY SPIRIT ON PRESIDENT TRUMP,
THAT YOU GIVE HIM SUPER NATURAL
WISDOM TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE
PLANS YOU HAVE FOR THE COUNTRY.
I ASK THAT YOU GIVE HIM WISDOM
TO LEAD COUNTRY INTO
RIGHTEOUSNESS, I ASK THAT YOU
GIVE HIM PERSEVERANCE, COURAGE
TO STAND FOR TRUTH AND TO
PROTECT HIM FROM ENEMIES AND
THOSE UNDERMINE AND I ASK THAT
YOU MAKE HIM -- WISDOM AND
STRENGTH AND PERSEVERANCE AND
BLESS HIM, MAY HE BE A GREAT
BLESSING TO OUR COUNTRY.
>> AMEN.
>> I WANT TO PRAY THAT THE
SPIRIT OF THE LORD WOULD REST ON
THE PRESIDENT, THE SPIRIT OF
WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING, THE
SPIRIT OF COUNSEL AND MIGHT,
SPIRIT OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD,
AMEN.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
COULD I ASK YOU ONE QUESTION?
>> YEAH.
>> WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?
>> I KNEW THE ANSWER.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I
SENT ABSENTEE BALLOT FROM
PRISON.
>> IT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO MYSELF.
THAT COULD BE TOO TOUGH.
LISTEN, CONGRATULATIONS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
FANTASTIC CHILDREN THAT ARE
STILL WITH YOU, IT WAS AN HONOR.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> APPRECIATE IT.
AGAIN, TO PRESIDENT ERDOGAN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, TO THE
PEOPLE OF TURKEY, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
I THINK THIS WOULD BE A BIG STEP
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP, WE HAVE HAD
A VERY HARSH RELATIONSHIP OVER
THE PAST NUMBER OF MONTHS
BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING
AND I'M NOT GOING TO BLAME
FAULT, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING, I'M SAYING THIS IS A
TREMENDOUS STEP TOWARD HAVING
THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH
TURKEY WHICH CAN BE A GREAT
RELATIONSHIP THAT I KNOW WE ARE
GOING TO HAVE, SO THANK YOU VERY
MUCH AND, PRESIDENT, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
>> DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS?
WOULD YOU LIKE --
>> WHAT YOUR NEXT PLANS ARE,
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING ON DOING
NOW THAT YOU ARE BACK SAFELY?
>> WE WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH
OUR CHILDREN ESPECIALLY AND THAT
TAKES SOME TIME TO PRAY AND SEE
WHAT GOD WANTS FOR THE NEXT PART
OF OUR LIVES.
>> WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE
WHILE YOU WERE DETAINED?
>> I THINK WE WILL DO THAT IN
THE FUTURE, WE WILL PROBABLY BE
DOING INTERVIEWS.
RIGHT NOW, WE JUST WANT
ESPECIALLY VISIT TIME TO THANK
THE ADMINISTRATION AND PEOPLE IN
GOVERNMENT WHO SUPPORTED US AND
THAT'S ESPECIALLY WHAT WE WANT.
GRATEFULLNESS TO SAY WE LOVE THE
COUNTRY.
WE ARRIVED IN GERMANY ON A PLANE
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT TO
TAKE US TO TURKEY, AMBASSADOR
MET US THERE AT 1:30 IN THE
MORNING AND HE HAD AN AMERICAN
FLAG TO GIVE US THAT HAD FLOWN
IN BERLIN AND I TOOK IT AND VERY
NATURALLY KISSED IT.
I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND WE PRAY
FOR THIS COUNTRY.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THE
DISAPPEARANCE AND POSSIBLE
MURDER OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI HAD
ANYTHING --
>> TIMING IS COINCIDENCE.
I'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE
SAY, WELL, IT'S PRETTY TRICKY,
COULD THERE BE ANYTHING TO IT,
NO, IT'S A TOTAL COINCIDENCE.
IT'S INTERESTING, A LOT OF
THINGS HAPPENING IN A CERTAIN
PART OF THE WORLD, YOU KNOW
THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS
GOING ON BUT THERE ARE PROBABLY
THINGS BEYOND THAT BUT NO, IT'S
STRICT COINCIDENCE, BILL.
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP --
>> I HAVE A FEELING I KNOW WHAT
HE'S GOING TO BE.
WAIT, WAIT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?
>> WE WILL BE SITTING TOGETHER
WITH FOLKS HERE AND MAKE A
DETERMINATION.
I WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THE
ORDER FOR THE MILITARY
$110 BILLION, I BELIEVE IT'S THE
LARGEST ORDER EVER MADE.
IT'S 450,000 JOBS.
IT'S THE BEST EQUIPMENT IN THE
WORLD, BUT IF THEY DON'T BUY IT
FROM US, THEY ARE GOING TO BUY
IT FROM RUSSIA OR THEY WILL BUY
IT FROM CHINA OR THEY ARE GOING
TO BUY IT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
BUT RUSSIA AND CHINA WANTED IT
VERY BADLY, I GOT 10%, ALMOST
10% OF THE ORDER AND I WOULD
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF JOBS,
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, A LOT OF
OTHER REASONS, I WOULD LIKE TO
DO SOMETHING WHERE WE COULD
MAYBE LOOK AT OTHER THINGS, I
WILL TELL THE SENATORS,
TREMENDOUS ORDER FOR THE
COMPANIES, IT'S A TREMENDOUS
ORDER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
STANDPOINT, YOU LOOK AT TEXAS,
HAS BIG CHUNK OF IT, ALMOST ALL
OF OUR STATES ARE INVOLVED IN
THAT ORDER.
I ACTUALLY THINK WE WOULD BE
PUNISHING OURSELVES IF WE DID
THAT.
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE COULD
DO THAT ARE POWERFUL AND STRONG
AND WE WILL DO IT.
AS OF THIS MOMENT NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT HAPPENED.
AS OF THIS MOMENT, WE ARE
LOOKING INTOJamieCmcs5195
THEY WILL GET BACK AND I KNOW
MIKE HAS BEEN DEALING WITH
THEM, JOHN HAS BEEN DEALING
WITH THEM.
IN TERMS OF THE ORDER OF 110
BILLION DOLLARS, ALL THEY WILL
DO IS GIVE IT TO OTHER
COUNTRIES AND I THINK THAT
WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH OF OUR
COUNTRY BUT THERE ARE OTHER
THINGS WE CAN DO THAT WILL BE
--
>> THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE CAN
DO.
THERE ARE MANY THINGS.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL THEM
SOME OF THE MANY THINGS WE
COULD DO THERE IS A BIG LIST.
>> YES THERE IS A LONG LIST WE
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI
ARABIA BUT MY PREFERENCE IS NOT
TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO LET'S
FIND OUT WHAT DID HAPPEN FIRST.
AND HIS FIANCCE STILL WAITING
TO FIND WHAT HAPPENS AND
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION
BUT UNTIL WE KNOW I HATE TO
TAKE THE NEXT STEP --
>> YES, WE HAVE INVITED HIS
FIANCCE.
SHE ACTUALLY WROTE A LETTER TO
MYSELF AND THE FIRST LADY AND A
BEAUTIFUL LETTER AND WE HAVE
INVITED HER AND I BELIEVE WE
ARE WORKING IT OUT WISH YOU
WILL BE COMING.
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HER.
IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY BUT
AT THIS POINT IT IS LOOKING
LIKE HEY, PERHAPS WON'T BE OR
ISN'T AROUND AND IT IS VERY
SAD.
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN BY
THEN THAT WAS OUR FIRST HOPE,
THAT HE WAS NOT KILLED BUT,
MAYBE THAT IS NOT LOOKING, IS
NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD.
>> THERE IS A LOT TO LEARN.
>> WE ARE WORKING ON THAT.
AS YOU SPEAK, WE ARE WORKING ON
THAT.
BY THE WAY, OTHER PEOPLE THAT
ARE IN PRISONS AND OTHER
COUNTRIES OTHER THAN TURKEY, WE
HAVE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE
BEEN THERE FOR MANY YEARS.
WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL.
AT THE LEAST, 18.
AND THE 18 WERE PEOPLE THAT
THEY SAID WOULD NEVER EVER BE
FREED AND BY THE WAY, PASTOR
BRUNSON WAS ONE OF THEM.
WE WERE TALKING BEFORE HOW MANY
YEARS WAS IT?
THE NUMBER THAT YOU TOLD ME, --
>> THEY WANTED 35 YEARS.
>> THEY WANTED HIM IN JAIL 35
YEARS.
WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD AND OTHER COUNTRIES
AND WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD,
THIS GROUP, WE ARE WORKING HARD
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.
>> LET ME SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WHAT IS REALLY BEST LET'S
DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED FIRST.
THERE'S PLENTY OF THINGS THAT
WE CAN DO THAT ARE VERY TOUGH.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED FIRST.
>> I HAVE NOT.
I MEAN WE HAVE ALL HEARD A LOT
ABOUT THE AUDIO BUT NO ONE HAS
SEEN IT YET.
WE DO WANT TO SEE IT.
I GUESS IS A COMBINATION OF
SEEING IT AND HEARING IT MAY BE
--
>> YES, WE WILL BE SEEING IT
VERY SOON.
>> NO I HAVE NOT.
I HAVE NOT CALLED YET I WILL
BE.
AND I WILL BE ALSO CALLING THE
KING OF SAUDI ARABIA.
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO ASK HIM WHAT IS GOING ON.
PROBABLY TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.
>> GO AHEAD.
>> FOR A TIME.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS AHEAD OF
US.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING,
THERE ARE OTHER AMERICAN
PRISONERS IN TURKEY.
I KNOW DEALING WITH THE
CONSULATE THERE, EXCELLENT
CONSULATE STAFF THERE.
THEY WERE NOT ONLY ENGAGING FOR
ME.
THERE ENGAGING FOR EVERYONE
THERE.
SO -- I KNOW THIS FROM TALKING
FROM CONSULATE STAFF AND THEY
WILL COME TO VISIT ME THAT THEY
WERE INVOLVED VERY MUCH IN
ADVOCATING FOR THE OTHER
PRISONERS THERE.
>> WITH RESPECT TO TURKEY OR
SAUDI ARABIA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
WHAT IS GOING ON IN IRAN, AND
OTHER PLACES, IT IS REALLY BAD.
IT IS REALLY BAD.
THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD THINGS
GOING ON IN THAT PART OF THE
WORLD AND FRANKLY IN OTHER
PARTS OF THE WORLD ALSO.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 19
PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN
RELEASED ABROAD PAID WHAT DID
YOU DO DIFFERENTLY THEN
PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS?
>> IT IS GOOD, I LIKE IT I
THINK I CAN TELL YOU WHY BUT I
WON'T.
BUT THEY CANNOT -- IT WILL STAY
THAT WAY.
>> I DID.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS FANTASTIC.
I THOUGHT THE FIRST LADY WAS
FANTASTIC LAST NIGHT.
I HOPE I DO AS WELL ON 60
MINUTES.
WILL YOU STILL BE SENDING
SECRETARY MNUCHIN TO THE
CONFERENCE LATER THIS MONTH?
>> WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
>> I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE
TO EVALUATE THE FACTS AND MAKE
THE DECISION.
WE SPOKE LAST NIGHT AND WE WILL
TAKE A LOOK AT THE REST OF THE
WEEK.
>> WE WERE VERY TOUGH ON TURKEY
AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY -- FRANKLY,
THE ONLY DEAL IS A
PSYCHOLOGICAL ONE.
WE FEEL MUCH DIFFERENT ABOUT
TURKEY TODAY THEN WE DID
YESTERDAY.
I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE OF
REALLY BECOMING MUCH CLOSER TO
TURKEY.
MAYBE EVEN HAVING A VERY GOOD
RELATIONSHIP.
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE AND AS THE
PASTOR SAID, THESE ARE CREDIBLE
PEOPLE.
THE PEOPLE OF TURKEY ARE
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.
I THINK WE HAVE IT JUST NOT TO
HAVE A GREATER RELATIONSHIP
WITH TURKEY.
I HOPE THAT HAPPENS, OKAY?
THANK YOU.
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY?
YOU AND TOM WORKED SO HARD.
>> WE WELCOME THE PASTOR BACK.
HE HAS BEEN MISSED BUT HIS WORK
IN TURKEY, LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE
HE WORKED, SPREADING THE WORD
OF JESUS CHRIST IS ABSOLUTELY
CRUCIAL AND IS FOUNDATIONAL FOR
THE COUNTRY, THAT IS WHY WE
LOVE IT SO MUCH.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
TOM?
>> PASTOR BRUNSON, YOU
MENTIONED -- THE FOLKS ON THE
GROUND IN TURKEY, THE TWO TIMES
I WAS THERE WERE AMAZING.
THEY DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT.
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THEY
MET WITH YOU AND IN THE PRISON
AND HOW MUCH TIME THEY SPENT
AND WE ARE VERY PROUD.
THEY HAVE DONE AN EXTRA
ORDINARY JOB.
>> IF HE DOESN'T SPEAK --
HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER
THERE.
>> THANK YOU, SIR.
>> WHAT A SPECIAL GUY.
WHAT A SPECIAL MAN OF CHRIST.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE OVAL
OFFICE AND INSTEAD OF SAYING
THANK YOU, FOR YOUR PRAYERS, HE
SAID LET ME PRAY FOR YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT.
WHAT A SPECIAL STATEMENT.
AND WHAT A SPECIAL STATEMENT
ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
PERSONALLY.
AND THE DELEGATION WORKED ON
THIS RELEASE FOR A VERY LONG
TIME BUT THINGS CHANGED.
WHEN THIS ADMINISTRATION CAME
IN.
AND THE DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF
THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND
DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT AND THE VICE
PRESIDENT HAS MADE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE.
WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO SEE THE
HAPPY FAMILY ALL BACK TOGETHER
ONCE AGAIN.
>> PASTOR, WELCOME HOME.
I THINK THE OTHER THING IS, YOU
HAVE DOZENS AND DOZENS -- YOU
HAD ONE CHAMPION AND THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
BUT HE WAS THE ANSWER TO
MILLIONS OF PRAYERS.
AND WE WELCOME YOU BACK, THANK
YOU FOR KEEPING THE FAITH.
THANK YOU TO THE ENTIRE TEAM
AND PRAISE GOD FOR A WONDERFUL
CELEBRATION TODAY.
AND THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, I
APPRECIATE IT.
>> THANK YOU, THERE WAS A
TRANSITION TIME BUT BOTH WERE
JUST SO WONDERFUL AND WE WANT
TO --
>> YOU KNOW HOW JAMES IS, I
WOULD LIKE YOU TO SAY SOMETHING
ON BEHALF OF YOUR HUSBAND, THE
BRAVERY THAT HE SHOULD APPEAR
BECAUSE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
WAS GOING ON.
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.
>> IT WAS HARD FOR HIM AND
REALLY THE LORD PULLED HIM
THROUGH.
I THINK IT WAS A GREAT
TESTIMONY IN TURKEY.
WE WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW
WHO WE REALLY ARE THERE.
THAT WE REALLY ARE THERE TO
BLESS THE COUNTRY.
THAT IS OUR DESIRE.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR BRAVERY
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY, TAKE YOU
FOR ALL OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT.
I DO NOT THINK WE WOULD BE
SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE SEEING
MY PARENTS RIGHT NOW IF IT WERE
NOT FOR YOUR INVOLVEMENT .
THANK YOU.
>> I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> SHE WAS THE FACE OF THE
FAMILY.
>> SHE WAS!
SHE HAS BECOME VERY FAMOUS.
>> I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE.
I KNOW YOU AND THE VICE
PRESIDENT HAVE WORKED REALLY
HARD AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE,
IT WAS REALLY HARD LIKE MY DAD
BEING GONE.
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HIM
BACK.
IT WAS DEFINITELY AMAZING.
>> IT IS TERRIFIC.
IT IS OUR HONOR.
WE WILL CLOSE OUT WITH YOU.
I'LL JUST SAY THE VICE
PRESIDENT, WE ARE SO HAPPY AND
SO THRILLED.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
YOU HAVE ALL FACED INCREDIBLE
RISK PERSONALLY.
YOUR TENACITY TO BE ABLE TO
STAY THERE, BY HIS SIDE
THROUGHOUT THIS, A GREAT
PERSONAL RISK TO YOURSELF AND
THROUGH THE PROCESS HAS BEEN
INSPIRING FOR MANY OF US TO BE
ABLE TO WATCH AS WELL.
WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO
YOU TO BE HOME AND WE LOOK
FORWARD TO HAVING CELEBRATIONS
LIKE THIS FROM OTHER AMERICANS
TO BE ABLE TO COME HOME AS
WELL.
LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THOSE
INDIVIDUALS RESOLVED BACK HOME
AS WELL.
WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL
AFTER TWO VERY LONG YEARS FOR
YOU TO BE ABLE TO BE HOME.
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR
STORIES.
DRIVING THROUGH DRIVE THROUGH
HIS AND GETTING A HAMBURGER AND
ABOUT GOING TO JUST HANG OUT
AND GOING TO YOUR OWN CHURCH
AND BEING ABLE TO RELAX AND BE
ABLE TO BE WITH FAMILY.
WE ARE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO
THOSE DAYS OF Y'ALL NOT HAVING
TO BE IN THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
PAPER AND BEING AMERICANS
