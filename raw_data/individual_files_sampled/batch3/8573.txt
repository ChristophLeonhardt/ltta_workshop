MICHAEL MOORE IS NOW MAKING DISASTER MOVIES, HIS NEW ONE AN EIGHTH PLACE FLOP MAKING ONLY $3 MILLION TOTAL. IT SANK FASTER THAN THE POSEIDON. DOES THE FLOP MATTER? MEANWHILE, THE COASTAL ELITES USE MORE AS A VIRTUE SIGNAL. THE FRENCH SAY 2 SAME THING SO THE LIE STANDS. MOORE’S FILMS ARE LIKE VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS. MOST OFFER ZERO BENEFIT BUT YOU STILL SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM BUT TO HIS CREDIT, MOORE’S MOVIES ARE OVERTLY POLITICAL. UNLIKE THE REST OF HOLLYWOOD, WHERE THEY INJECT POLITICS TO GET STUFF MADE. THEN THERE IS THAT PART ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. AT LEAST MOORE WEARS HIS POLITICS ON HIS SLEEVE. GOD KNOWS THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM. I’M SURE THE MEDIA EXPECTED THE FILM TO OPEN BIG. A REJECTION OF TRUMP AND YOU. IT DIDN’T AND IT WASN’T. THE LESSONS, IDEOLOGY AS ENTERTAINMENT IS AS LOONY AS A COLONOSCOPY FOR RECREATION. PLUS AMERICA DOESN’T NEED A LECTURE FROM A RICH DUDE ABOUT HOW BAD THINGS ARE WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD. OUR COUNTRY’S METRICS LOOK GREAT WHICH TURNS MOORE’S CINEMA INTO A FAIRY TALE. AS USUAL, WHEN THERE ARE FLOPS THE MEDIA IGNORES IT. IF IT WAS NUMBER ONE YOU CAN BET HE WOULD BE EVERYWHERE. THERE IS AN OLD SAYING, YOU DON’T REPORT ON PLANES THAT DON’T CRASH BUT YOU ALSO DON’T REPORT ON YOUR FAVORITE BELIEFS THAT DO. YOU KNOW, JUDGE, WE JUST WANTED TO ESCAPE. WHO GOES TO MOVIES FOR POLITICAL, WOULD YOU GO TO SEE A POLITICAL MOVIE RIGHT OR LEFT? JUDGE PERINO: I’M DYING TO GO TO A MOVIE. I’M TRYING TO GET ANYONE TO TAKE ME TO THE MOVIES. I WOULD GO TO MICHAEL MOORE? YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON’T THINK JUDGE PERINO: YOU AND I COULDN’T AGREE ON A MOVIE. I’LL PICK A MOVIE. JUDGE PERINO: BEN HUR. SOMETHING IN THIS CENTURY. JUDGE PERINO: "GONE WITH THE WIND"? KENNEDY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE? WHAT DO I WANT TO SEE? GOSH, I LOVE MARVEL MOVIES. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD YOU LOVE? THE NEW NICHOLAS CAGE MOVIE. MANDY. IT’S FANTASTIC. I HEARD HIS CHARACTER IS UNREAL. BUT IT’S SO FUNNY BECAUSE WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THIS, WE’RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MOORE BECAUSE IT’S NOT ENTERTAINMENT, IT’S NOT HOW PEOPLE CONSUME THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. EVERYONE HAS GIANT COSTCO TVs, 50-INCH PLATINUM TV OR PLASMA, WHATEVER. SOON FOX NATION, YOU’RE ABLE TO WATCH THIS INCREDIBLE CONTENT AND YOU GO TO MOVIES FOR TOTAL ESCAPISM. THAT’S WHEN YOU BECAUSE, IN FACT, MICHAEL MOORE HAD SOME HIT MOVIES THAT WERE ABOUT NEWS. BUT NOW I THINK NEWS IS SO OMNIPRESENT. FAKE NEWS. SO THE BIG WEEK THE BIG MOVIE IN MY FAMILY THIS WEEKEND WAS "THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN THE WALLS." WAS THAT GOOD? I DIDN’T GO, EVER WENT EXCEPT ME BECAUSE I WORKED. THEY LIKED IT? THEY LOVED IT. THE LITTLE GUYS GOT A LITTLE SCARED BUT THAT’S WHERE PEOPLE WENT. THEY DIDN’T GO TO MICHAEL MOORE BUT I THINK IT’S BECAUSE THE NEWS IS KIND OF ROUGH. YOU NEED ESCAPISM. HERE’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND. THE FIRST MOVIE WAS BASED ON A CONSPIRACY THEORY AND THE AUDIENCE LOVES THAT REMEMBER THE SAUDI CONNECTION TO THE BUSH FAMILY. DICK CHENEY’S WAR PROPHETEERS. THE CRITICS LOVED IT BECAUSE IT WAS FRESH. THERE IS NO CONSPIRACY WITH DONALD TRUMP. IT’S ALL OUT IN THE OPEN. THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. IF ANYTHING, PEOPLE ARE CONSPIRING AGAINST HIM AND IF YOU WANT ANTI-TRUMP PROPAGANDA, YOU WATCH CNN OR YOU WATCH MSNBC. YOU KNOW WHAT’S INTERESTING, AND MICHAEL MOORE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO CALLED THE ELECTION AHEAD OF TIME. THERE WERE VERY FEW, SO MANY PEOPLE, ALL THE POLLSTERS WERE OFF AND HE WAS THE ONE PERSON ON THE LEFT, I KNOW THESE PEOPLE, I KNOW THESE PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN AND THE RUSTBELT AND THEY ARE SO DISENFRANCHISED, WHAT HE’S SAYING RESONATES, AND HE COULD EASILY WIN, AT LEAST THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY AND HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. SO HE MAKES A BETTER ANALYST. THEY THOUGHT SOMEBODY ELSE WAS BENEFITING, NOT THEM. I THINK THAT’S WHAT IT IS. AND JESSE, BY THE WAY, I JUST, TO ME, WHEN YOU LOOK AT MICHAEL MOORE, IT SEEMS TO ME MICHAEL MOORE WAS HITTING SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY REAL BEFORE, AND YOU
