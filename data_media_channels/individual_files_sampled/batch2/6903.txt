a number of protests have broken out in Iran and it has to do with a number of different factors including the economic situation and some aggression toward the religious rule and politicians that Iranians feel have reneged on their promises now the protests according to reports began against rising prices but have spiraled into a general outcry against clerical rule and government policies now as some of you might know Iran's government is essentially broken into two main parts there are the elected officials and then there are the religious leaders or the religious establishment and the religious establishment goes around telling people what they can and can't do essentially the morality police and the elected officials are the ones who can get elected out of office if they don't follow through on their promises but keep in mind that the big dawgs the ones who really have the final say are the religious leaders in the country now this developed into a broader anti-government demonstration calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings so there's a lot of different things going on inflation is a big problem the cost of eggs for instance has doubled recently the unemployment rate is at twelve point four percent which is obviously incredibly high and a lot of this had to do with the sanctions but since lifting the sanctions the economy improved a little bit but apparently there's now been a rebound yeah so there's there's a number of factors here one is that the they're not responsible to the people of course not a bunch of clerics run Iran and they say that the president Hassan rouhani is a moderate a moderate cleric among the different clerics that the other clerics chose from so it's all relative and of course as always he broke his campaign promises he said that he would work for the release of Mir Hossein Mousavi and Matti Karoubi who were part of the uprising in 2009 when the people stood up against the Iranian leadership in the green movement and he in two different elections and never delivered so there are politicians a little similar to our politicians in that sense and you remember that the Arab Spring started in Tunisia because of economic turmoil so economic turmoil often makes a giant difference and of all of a sudden things that you buy every day are twice as much well you can buy only half as much food and then people get hungry and they get agitated to get in the streets there is one other element the Saudis have been trying to destabilize Iran for quite some time now and they're fighting them in Yemen because Iran is backing the Shia in Yemen and the Saudis are backing this Sunnis in Yemen and there was recently a report out about how the Saudis had kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and within that great New York Times article they explained that the Saudi Crown Prince was trying to agitate Palestinians to rise up against Hezbollah which is backed by Iran so they've been trying to agitate to get people to rebel against the Iranian government I got no love for the Iranian government I wish the people would have in Iran would have a democracy and get rid of the mullahs but there are a lot of forces at play here and I and I had forgotten that until I was reading this when I saw that one of the chants in the city that started everything Mashhad in this case was not Gaza not Lebanon my life for Iran okay like huh really there are people out there that are worried about the price of eggs that are going on and chanting about don't send help it to Gaza and Lebanon right so look III think that there there's some feasibility to what you're saying right definitely but also keep in mind that people in Iran are dealing with the inflation dealing with massive unemployment and they are also seeing their resources go toward you know efforts in other countries so the involvement in Yemen involvement in Iraq and so they're irritated at the military spending that's that's going I don't believe it they're really really on that one I know like are they Restless yes right are is their government oppressing them yes but and could is it theoretically possible that they're like why are you spending abroad when you should be spending at home of course that happens in a lot of countries but in this case it is exactly the agenda both Santa Arabia and the u.s. to say that hey don't agitate Hezbollah that could go against Israel or the Shia in Yemen they're in the middle of that conflict we just saw a report about how they're the Saudis are trying to meddle in Iranian affairs it's just too convenient to be like don't go to Yemen don't go to Gaza and Lebanon right eggs the price of bread I get that yeah that seems like uh-oh what's going on here I mean is it is it true that Saudi Arabia's hands are in a lot of cookie jars if we're talking about how overextended they are in different countries for sure are they consciously part of a demonizing campaign against Iran and Shias like undoubtably and are they at war with Iran in Yemen Syria through Hezbollah in Lebanon as well and Iraq to some extent yes but this protest and the critique of over spending in terms of militarism is kind of parallel to protests in the whole entire region and is there some savviness of the population in regards to making those links in ways we don't make these links in the US yes undoubtedly I mean you saw this also in Saudi Arabia in 2011 there were protests against the rise of price of milk which is subsidized by the country and you saw people questioning whether or not the government should continue its its enormous expenditures outside of the country well it's taking away from the social services safety net so those are things that are really part of like the heart of protest in the region and actually did start the uprisings and this is the point that we make in my book demanding dignity that most of these movements that called for the overthrow started with protesting against the rise of cost of bread inflation and unemployment I mean this is also part of the protests as well twelve point four percent unemployment in Iran and to give people some of what Western unemployment is it's around like 4% so when they see an easing of sanctions and not a certain kind of proportional effect on their economic position I think there is a lot of frustration but I will also say and I know I'm going on this is like you know this is my bread and butter I love Middle Eastern politics that Saudi Arabia and Iran are so much alike I mean 1979 is the time when the extremist regimes came to power in both countries in Saudi Arabia it was pretty common to see people wearing bikinis and swimsuits in hotel pools same thing with Iran so I just I see them mirroring each other and of course there's multiple agitations on both sides and the other really interesting thing is that they're also trying to use approaches to women's rights to try to squash and repress any sort of resistance to the regime's lack of you know supporting its citizens through economic incentives so in in Saudi Arabia women now have the right to drive sort of as long as they get permission from the males and their families and then in Iran at least I believe it's Tehran they've allowed women okay let me rephrase that women caught not wearing their head scarves might not be detained but only not another part right so look there's false moderation everywhere and it's it's to serve as a release valve yes it's a question of pressure so hey we've got Hassan rouhani who was a moderate and so but that what happened he did got they got rid of the sanctions in the deal that they did with the u.s. that's good for the u.s. good for Iran and money was supposed to come back in the country and inflation did go down for a little bit everybody was a little relief inflation has gone back up why because the elites like here took all the money and they didn't share it with the people of Iran all their bank accounts got unfrozen they took all that money out and put it in their pockets so the mullahs they wear their robes because they got stacks of money underneath the road okay and and so and here's another hilarious guy pretending to be a moderate the head of the Mossad Revolutionary Court says we consider protests to be the people's right oh that sounds good it's a good beginning but if some people want to abuse these emotions and ride this wave we won't wait and we will confront them okay it sounds like no you're not in favor say you don't think it's their right and you will crush them and and that's what they're doing they're arresting people and a lot of these different cities somewhat 52 arrested in one of the cities and is spreading across Iran so I don't want anybody get me wrong I think I would be surprised if most of it was not organic because there is a ton of pent-up frustration in Iran as there should be and and so it'll be interesting to see where it goes I mean but there's frustration in Saudi Arabia to see the kind of expenditures that are taking place in terms of the military campaigns and Yemen and the destruction that's happening in Yemen and also the frustration with the crown prince who's taken that over as his mission and so there are I see what you're saying and I do think that there is probably international interference for sure but I do think people see so much government spending on the outside and nothing in their coffers and get frustrated absolutely and I told you with you method that there's fundamentalist birds of a feather flock together and so saturated Iran think they're radically different because one is Sunni and one is Shia okay so I'm not a religious person so to me there's absolutely no difference between those oh that the fourth caliph was a legitimate caliph and the other one thinks the third one was okay for all same people that is enormous ly irrelevant you're both acting the same exact way and it's fundamentalist and it oppresses your own people no one really cares what you call it we know what it is in reality what you just watched was one of the
