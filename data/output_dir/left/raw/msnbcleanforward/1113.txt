00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:18,772
REALLY MORE OF A PROPAGANDA PIECE, A PR PIECE THAN A LEGAL

YOU CAN’T REALLY REACH LEGAL CONCLUSIONS UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT

00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,315
THE FACTS ARE. THAT’S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU

72
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:30,218
THAT’S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GATHER THE FACTS AND LOOK AT THE

73
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,419
GATHER THE FACTS AND LOOK AT THE ARGUMENTS AND THEN DECIDE

74
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,620
ARGUMENTS AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER SOME LAW HAS BEEN

75
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:32,920
WHETHER SOME LAW HAS BEEN BROKEN.

76
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:34,588
BROKEN. WITHOUT SEEING WHAT THOSE FACTS

77
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:36,390
WITHOUT SEEING WHAT THOSE FACTS ARE IT’S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

78
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:39,794
ARE IT’S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE. I IMAGINE GIULIANI AND CREW CAN

79
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:40,928
I IMAGINE GIULIANI AND CREW CAN LOOK AT WHAT’S PUBLICLY BEEN

80
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,530
LOOK AT WHAT’S PUBLICLY BEEN REPORTED AND TRY TO CRAFT LEGAL

81

YOU KNOW ALL THE FACTS IT’S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RESPOND TO

84
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:48,136
REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RESPOND TO IT.

85
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,338
IT. THAT’S WHY I THINK THIS DOCUMENT

86
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,607
THAT’S WHY I THINK THIS DOCUMENT IS REALLY NONSENSE AND MORE OF A

87
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,843
IS REALLY NONSENSE AND MORE OF A PUBLIC RELATIONS VEHICLE THAN

88
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,144
PUBLIC RELATIONS VEHICLE THAN ANY SORT OF DOCUMENT.

HE’S BEEN A LAWYER AND AN IMPORTANT LAWYER IN THE

95
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:07,755
IMPORTANT LAWYER IN THE GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME.

96
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,625
GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME. HE MUST KNOW THAT THIS PUBLIC

97
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,159
HE MUST KNOW THAT THIS PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN IS NOT THE

98
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,727
RELATIONS CAMPAIGN IS NOT THE SAME AS A LEGAL RESPONSE TO THE

99
00:03:12,728 --> 00:03:14,128
SAME AS A LEGAL RESPONSE TO THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

100
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,563
MUELLER INVESTIGATION. >> HE ABSOLUTELY DOES, AND, YOU

101
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:16,664
>> HE ABSOLUTELY DOES, AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO

102
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,901
KNOW, I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO SAY BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW

103
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:21,937
SAY BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW THIS, IF THIS WERE A CASE IN

104
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,672
THIS, IF THIS WERE A CASE IN COURT, YOU KNOW, IF THERE WAS A

105
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:26,041
COURT, YOU KNOW, IF THERE WAS A JUDGE PREICIDESING OVER THIS,

106
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,576
JUDGE PREICIDESING OVER THIS, GIULIANI WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO

107
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:31,947
GIULIANI WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SAY THESE THINGS.

108
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:33,648
SAY THESE THINGS. THEY WOULD PROHIBIT IT.

109
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,783
THEY WOULD PROHIBIT IT. WHAT HE’S DOING IS TAKING

110
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:36,818
WHAT HE’S DOING IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THERE

111
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:39,488
ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO TECHNICALLY PENDING CASE

112
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:40,789
IS NO TECHNICALLY PENDING CASE WITH THE JUDGE, AND HE CAN JUST

113
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:42,024
WITH THE JUDGE, AND HE CAN JUST GO AND SAY WHATEVER HE FEELS

114
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:45,394
GO AND SAY WHATEVER HE FEELS LIKE SAYING, APPARENTLY.

115
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:46,762
LIKE SAYING, APPARENTLY. I MEAN I’VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES,

116
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,563
I MEAN I’VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES, I THINK SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE

117
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:51,266
I THINK SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID I THINK IF HE HASN’T

118
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,301
SAID I THINK IF HE HASN’T ALREADY CROSSED THE LINE HE’S

119
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,837
ALREADY CROSSED THE LINE HE’S CLOSE TO CROSSING THE LINE OF

120
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,406
CLOSE TO CROSSING THE LINE OF ETHICAL RULES.

121
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,275
ETHICAL RULES. WE’RE SORT OF IN UNKNOWN

122
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:00,676
WE’RE SORT OF IN UNKNOWN UNCHARTED TERRITORY OF AN

123
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:02,878
UNCHARTED TERRITORY OF AN INVESTIGATION, IS TRUMP A PARTY

124
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,912
INVESTIGATION, IS TRUMP A PARTY TO THAT INVESTIGATION?

125
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:07,382
TO THAT INVESTIGATION? BUT THE POINT I THINK PEOPLE

126
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,984
BUT THE POINT I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD UNDERSTAND IS THAT

127
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:10,285
SHOULD UNDERSTAND IS THAT GIULIANI FULL WELL KNOWS THAT HE

128
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:12,687
GIULIANI FULL WELL KNOWS THAT HE CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS BECAUSE

129
00:04:12,689 --> 00:00:00,000
CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS BECAUSE THIS ISN’T IN A COURT OF LAW,
