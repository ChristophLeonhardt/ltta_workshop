1
00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,007
>> Reporter: THERE HAVE NOT BEEN

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:03,075
CONCESSIONS BY THE

3
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:03,809
ADMINISTRATION, AT LEAST NOT

4
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:04,109
YET.

5
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:04,943
>> Sean: NOT ONE, THAT'S RIGHT.

6
00:00:04,943 --> 00:00:06,578
ED HENRY, THANK YOU.

7
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:08,947
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED OUT ABOUT

8
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:10,315
THE FBI SCANDAL CONTROVERSY

9
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:12,885
WHERE, QUOTE, IF THE PERSON

10
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,086
PLAYS VERY EARLY INTO MY

11
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:16,055
CAMPAIGN WASN'T A SPY, PUT THERE

12
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:17,956
BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION FOR

13
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:19,892
POLITICAL PURPOSES, HOW COME

14
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:21,160
SUCH A SEEMINGLY MASSIVE AMOUNT

15
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,530
OF MONEY WAS PAID FOR SERVICES

16
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,864
RENDERED, MANY TIMES HIGHER THAN

17
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:26,198
NORMAL.

18
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:26,865
FOLLOW THE MONEY.

19
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:29,068
THE SPY WAS THERE EARLY IN THE

20
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:31,036
CAMPAIGN YET NEVER REPORTED

21
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:32,470
COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA BECAUSE

22
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,406
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.

23
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:36,909
HE WAS ONLY THERE TO SPY FOR

24
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,043
POLITICAL REASONS AND HELP

25
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:39,645
CROOKED HILLARY WIN, JUST LIKE

26
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,447
THEY DID TO POOR BERNIE SANDERS

27
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:42,381
WHO GOT DUPED.

28
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:42,815
SO TRUE.

29
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:45,417
JOINING US WITH REACTION,

30
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,251
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JIM

31
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:48,220
JORDAN.

32
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,922
BERNIE SANDERS, WHOLE THING WAS

33
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:51,690
RIGGED.

34
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,325
JIM, JORDAN, LET ME START WITH

35
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:53,759
YOU.

36
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,260
NUMBER ONE, YOUR LETTER.

37
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,796
THERE ARE 100 KINGMEN THAT WANT

38
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:59,665
YOU TO BE SPEAKER.

39
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:02,568
FRANKLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU

40
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,536
BE THE NEXT SPEAKER.

41
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,172
>> IF AND WHEN THERE'S A RACE, I

42
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,174
PLAN ON BEING PART OF THAT

43
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:11,710
DISCUSSION.

44
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,012
WE NEED TO STAY IN MAJORITY AND

45
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:14,913
HELP DONALD TRUMP ACCOMPLISHED

46
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:15,814
THE THINGS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

47
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,416
ELECTED US TO DO.

48
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:21,053
THAT'S WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON

49
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:21,386
DOING.

50
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:24,056
>> Sean: I HAVE ZERO FAITH IN

51
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:25,691
ROD ROSENSTEIN AND THE DOJ TO

52
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,860
ACTUALLY HAND OVER THE DOCUMENTS

53
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,928
BECAUSE WE KNOW SPECIFIC

54
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,363
DOCUMENTS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY

55
00:01:31,363 --> 00:01:33,298
DAMNING IF THEY COME OUT AGAINST

56
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:34,032
THESE VERY PEOPLE.

57
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,201
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT TO

58
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:36,602
THEMSELVES?

59
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:38,303
>> WELL, SEAN, THAT'S ONE OF THE

60
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:39,571
REASONS WHY I DON'T BELIEVE AT

61
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:40,606
THE UPCOMING MEETING THE

62
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,474
CHAIRMAN NUNES IS HAVING WITH

63
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:43,242
MEMBERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE

64
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:44,977
COMMITTEE, THAT THERE WILL BE

65
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,044
ANY PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.

66
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,346
AND THAT'S DEEPLY CONCERNING TO

67
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:47,980
ME.

68
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,348
IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

69
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:50,115
SCOREBOARD, RIGHT NOW THE DEEP

70
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:51,650
STATE IS WINNING THE BATTLE

71
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,719
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FULL CONTROL

72
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,354
OF THEIR OWN DESTINY.

73
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:58,023
THAT'S WHY CONGRESSMAN LEE

74
00:01:58,023 --> 00:01:59,925
ZELLDEN AND JIM JORDAN JOINED

75
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,161
WITH TWO DOZEN COLLEAGUES TO

76
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,362
CALL FOR A SECOND SPECIAL

77
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:03,729
COUNSEL.

78
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,130
>> Sean: IS THAT THE BEST WAY,

79
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,464
THOUGH?

80
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:06,064
>> ABSOLUTELY, SEAN.

81
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:07,266
>> Sean: WELL, THE INSPECTOR

82
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:09,300
GENERAL'S RIDICULOUS.

83
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,869
18 MONTHS INTO THE CLINTON EMAIL

84
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:11,336
INVESTIGATION.

85
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:12,538
WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME.

86
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:13,939
>> SEAN, THIS WILL BE A REASON

87
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,207
FOR THEM TO DELAY THE INSPECTOR

88
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:16,108
GENERAL REPORT.

89
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,843
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE BACK IN

90
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:18,610
INSPECTOR GENERAL LAND AND SO

91
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,146
NOW WE WON'T GET THE ANSWERS ON

92
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:21,680
HILLARY CLINTON --

93
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,482
>> Sean: WELL, HE SAID IT

94
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:24,116
SEPARATE AND AAPART.

95
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:25,584
THAT'S BEEN HANDED OVER.

96
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:28,387
HERE'S THE PROBLEM, THOUGH.

97
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:30,522
WE HAVE FISA ABUSE.

98
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:33,058
WE KNOW OUTRIGHT JUDGES WERE

99
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:36,595
LIED TO IN LITERALLY THE SINGLE

100
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:39,164
BIGGEST INTRUSION INTO A

101
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:40,132
PERSON'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS,

102
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,901
A FISA WARRANT.

103
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,336
FOUR TIMES THEY LIED, THE BULK

104
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:46,605
OF INFORMATION, THAT PHONY

105
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:46,972
DOSSIER.

106
00:02:46,972 --> 00:02:48,607
THEY NEVER TOLD THE JUDGE WHO

107
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:49,808
PAID FOR IT OR JUDGES.

108
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:51,043
>> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

109
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:52,878
SAYS, DON'T WORRY, WE CAN

110
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:53,612
INVESTIGATE OURSELVES EVEN

111
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:56,181
THOUGH, AS YOU SAY, THEY TOOK A

112
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:58,483
DOSSIER TO A SECRET COURT TO GET

113
00:02:58,483 --> 00:02:59,751
A WARRANT.

114
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:03,288
DIDN'T TELL THE COURT THAT THE

115
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:04,857
AUTHOR OF THE DOCUMENT,

116
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:06,058
CHRISTOPHER STEELE, HAD BEEN

117
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:06,425
FIRED.

118
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:09,595
EVEN THOUGH IT NOW APPEARS THERE

119
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:10,729
WERE PAID INFORMANTS HANGING

120
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,664
AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE

121
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:13,732
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

122
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:14,466
>> Sean: THINK OF WHAT YOU'RE

123
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:15,634
SAYING.

124
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:16,969
SPIED ON THE CAMPAIGN, LYING TO

125
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,804
JUDGES TO GET FISA WARRANTS TO

126
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:22,474
SPY ON AN OPPOSITION PARTY

127
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:23,442
CANDIDATE WITH PROPAGANDA FROM

128
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:25,777
RUSSIA PUT TOGETHER BY A FOREIGN

129
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:28,280
NATIONAL THAT WAS FULL OF LIES

130
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,781
AND LITERALLY THEY DON'T TELL

131
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:30,782
THE JUDGES.

132
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:32,117
I CANNOT BELIEVE -- I WOULDN'T

133
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:34,219
WRITE THIS IN A SPY NOVEL,

134
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,520
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T THINK ANYBODY

135
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,188
WOULD BELIEVE IT.

136
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:38,824
>> JEFF SESSIONS SAYS ONLY UNDER

137
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:39,625
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES DO

138
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,627
YOU NAME A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

139
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,328
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THE TOP FIVE

140
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:44,730
PEOPLE AT THE FBI HAVE BEEN

141
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,131
FIRED OR DEMOTED.

142
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:47,532
THOSE SAME PEOPLE THAT RAN THE

143
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,034
CLINTON INVESTIGATION, WHO

144
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:49,635
LAUNCHED THE RUSSIA

145
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:51,169
INVESTIGATION, WHO USED THE

146
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:51,970
OPPOSITION RESEARCH DOCUMENT AT

147
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,539
THE FISA COURT AND NOW LOOK LIKE

148
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,275
PAID INFORMANTS TO BE A PART OF

149
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:57,042
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

150
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,244
HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A FACT

151
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:00,445
PATTERN THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY?

152
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:01,980
IF THAT'S NOT EXTRAORDINARY,

153
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,182
SOMEONE BETTER TELL ME WHAT IS.

154
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,551
>> THAT'S WHY JIM JORDAN SHOULD

155
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,452
BE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, THEN

156
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:10,088
WE'D HAVE REAL OVERSIGHT.

157
00:04:10,088 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sean: CHECKMATE.
