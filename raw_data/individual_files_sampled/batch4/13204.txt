I've returned from the motherland with a tweed clad pipe smoking Queens saving realization Donald Trump is a traditionalist will discuss the Disraeli esque high culture conservatism of our reality TV president then investor Hal Lambert joins to discuss his new Republican only investment fund with the stock ticker symbol Magga finally Emily Butler and his Eminence Paul Bois joined the panel of deplorable z' to discuss sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein and president Trump's huge IQ I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Nolt show I don't know if you could tell but I'm back from England I don't know if any of that gave it away Mary the tweet or this absolutely ridiculous pipe I was very nice to spend some time in the motherland I was in London and then Oxford a stop by to see the son of the supreme ruler of the multiverse Andrew Klavan son and then I was up in the Cotswolds in the countryside I'll have one last puff before I put this out delicious and I gave me an interesting view on politics because I've been to the UK before very briefly I'd never really spent any time there and politics is different there conservatism is different there it even threw into light some of what I couldn't quite understand about Donald Trump the conservatism there has something that very often we're missing which is traditionalism it's the sort of conservatism that comes out of Edmund Burke who says the age of chivalry is gone that of Sophos truce economists and calculators has succeeded it and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever he's writing about the French Revolution there and how terrible it was even though he's supported the American Revolution and the trouble with American conservatism is very often it is just the stuff of softened sisters economists and calculators all we really talk about are how we want low taxes and you know small government for its own sake and not really the the reasons why we want those things what what greater Goods those things serve and it's very often grounded in what would be rationalistic ideas so Edmund Burke really doesn't seem to have much care for rationalism but that's the idea that we always just stand for something it's just principles floating out in the breeze but it isn't founded on any real institutions like civil society the church the family local communities a lot of the reasons why we prefer more local and smaller government in the United States the place where this difference is a clearest between traditionalism and those other varieties of conservatism like libertarianism neoconservatism the religious right whatever the place where that is clearest is Oxford the University of Oxford I didn't realize this I went to Yale Yale is like the Dizz and version of Oxford Oxford is like the real thing you know and Yale is Epcot version of that it's a stunning place and it has at it the weight of history the difference between these politics is really clear there and the difference between the UK and the United States there's no date that we can say this is the founding of the University of Oxford we know that there was teaching there around 1096 but it's sort of sprung up a little organically we developed over a thousand years it's older than the English language in its current form but we know that Yale was founded in 1701 when I look at the various controversies that have hit those two places in the last few years I'm not surprised that Oxford has weathered them better than Yale so at Yale we had to rename Calhoun College you remember that crazy controversy students screaming at their professors yelling at them professors being fired for offending the little snowflake II eighteen year olds who were shrieking profanities at them they did rename the college eventually at Oxford there was a similar fit of hysteria about Cecil Rhodes the statue of the guy for whom the Rhodes Scholarship is named because he was imperialist colonialist and he dealt in Africa and all of that it went nowhere it went nowhere they totally let the statue stay because there's a weight of something a weight of history that describes the conservatism of the United Kingdom and describes that place that that we just don't really have unfortunately in American politics it's usually pretty easy to nail down you know which political party does which thing which side and politics has which ideology in Britain it's a little harder you can't really tell us sometimes who are the Conservatives you can't really tell who are the is this liberal as this leftist even where I was joking with Andrew Klavan about this in in the England even the socialist seems sort of conservative they have eat you because as he says whatever the British do is they're living in the past so even if they're socialists if they're communists whatever they're there's just a certain reading into their culture that they can't seem to overcome even you know even the socialism in England which is very bad and not good for society even that is better than the socialism in Italy or France it just is a little more orderly it's a little less lazy or what have you now with Trump now with Trump political ideology has become a little murkier and a little less clear as well over here there are questions is he a populist is he a conservative is he a secret Nazi Russian KGB Manchurian Candidate all of the above perhaps from my vantage last week in the motherland perhaps the defining feature of President Trump's political vision came into view is respect for American institutions and tradition his traditionalism among all the calls to topple Columbus statues and rename Columbus Day Trump signed a proclamation on Monday that said quote the permanent arrival of Europeans to the Americas was a transformative event that undeniably and fundamentally changed the course of human history and set the stage for the development of our great nation therefore on Columbus Day not indigenous peoples take Columbus Day we honor the skilled navigator and man of faith whose courageous feet brought together continents and has inspired countless others to pursue their dreams and convictions even in the face of extreme doubt and tremendous adversity so it this seems like a minor point the the tradition of Columbus Day who were honoring what day it is whatever but to Trump it's quite important because it's about respect and in a an understanding and absorption a living through the institutions that have made our country great and not merely platitudes and and simple words and phrases and ideas that do it he's waiting vigorously on the issue of NFL players not respecting traditions like standing for the national anthem and saluting the flag even his economic policy of skepticism toward big government and big business alike of grand charitable gestures by billionaires that look a lot like Donald J Trump has echoes of the distributism that was embraced by the 20th century traditionalists like GK Chesterton and TS Eliot among others speaking of Eliot even Trump's constant use of highly modern media like reality TV and Twitter to propagate support for traditional institutions reminds one of Eliot's use of modernism - attack - attack modernism rather and yes I think that is the first time that Donald Trump has ever been compared to TS Eliot president Trump's take on patriotism might have been written by Benjamin Disraeli the British traditionalist and prime prime minister who pioneered one nation conservatism and one nation conservatism posits that societies develop organically that members within those societies have obligations toward each other and it emphasizes the pragmatism the reality requires and insists the patriotic devotion among other impulses compelled a fortunate to take care of the less fortunate when one part of America hurts we all heard and when one citizen suffers and injustice we all suffer together loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another love for America requires love for all of its people when we open our hearts to patriotism there is no room for prejudice no place for bigotry and no tolerance for hate make America great again is a beautiful phrase it's why Reagan used it in the first place the make America great again it's simple the language is Saxon its Curt its evocative it's called a populist appeal by the common knowledge of the political commentary at but what have they ever known the phrase isn't actually that populist the phrase isn't do whatever you want in America the phrase isn't make America work for you you you you me me me the phrases make America great again it's a call to make use of the strong institutions inherited by this country and developed in this country to sustain the life of a country whose organic growth has produced the most just most charitable most free nation in the history of the world and speaking of Magha speaking of make America great again we got to bring on Hal Lambert we have the investor Hal Lambert on today of point bridge cab at all Hal has created an ETF an exchange-traded fund for investing exclusively in companies that back Republicans its ticker symbol why it's Magga of course Maga how thank you for coming on thank you for having me Michael so first question I guess this is kind of a gimme but I gotta ask how did you come up with the idea for a Magga ETF a Republican only ETF well you know it sounds simple but it actually wasn't it's never been done before so it clearly wasn't too simple but I've been in the investment business for about 20 years managing money I've been involved in politics for the last decade I've helped a couple different Republican presidential campaigns was involved with Ted Cruz's campaign okay before that Governor Perry in fact I ran a super PAC for Ted Cruz so very involved in politics for a number of years and being in the investment field I noticed a lot of people were you know upset about what's going on and they've been boycotting products writing services and and at the same time they didn't realize that they actually owned those products or services they owned those companies in their mutual funds and so they're boycotting out on the one hand and then they're they're losing money on the other right and you know Starbucks is a perfect example a lot of people are working or wake lighting Starbucks the stock was going lower it might have been losing money and not realizing so I kind of started thinking how do i how do i tap into that and enable people to both you know with their money and with their buying power make big choices and there wasn't a choice in the market there's there's never been a politically based ETF that's Annette Skye dia story that's an interesting point too because I have just considered it as a reaction to the left constantly politicizing every aspect of our culture every business they're gonna do this they're gonna do that but it also makes sense if you are boycotting a business you probably don't want to be owning it in your portfolio you don't want to be hurting yourself slapping your nose despite your face do you worry that this ETF and maybe others that will follow your example do you worry that that will further politicize the culture or is it an appropriate response culture that the left insists already on politicizing now I think it's a very appropriate response to the culture in general and I think it's a good investment decision as well so you know you mentioned it being pro it is pro so you're you're wanting to support companies that are supportive of Republican candidates and we may be upset with Republicans and many of us are but it's unfortunately it's a binary choice right so you've got a democrat or republican i do you want to be investing with that's supporting the candidates you want the ones that are supporting heavily Democratic candidates or Republican ones no that's that's that's an option and that's the real question too because someone like me who's slightly to the right of Attila the Hun I probably would take a lower return if it meant that I got to slap Schultz across the face or something but is there going to be any conflict between the returns you're getting and the and your politics you know is it the case they're Republicans supporting companies actually are the ones that throw off the great returns or are you or you sacrificing a return to make a political statement yeah I don't think you're sacrificing return so what I did was I took the S&P 500 and I screened it for the political contributions of the PACs and the employees of those companies and I took the top 150 companies in the SP so the SP is already a pretty exclusive club you've got a great number of companies it's 150 stocks they're heavily supported their great stocks you've got a lot of defense companies like General Dynamics Lockheed Boeing you've got a lot of financials you know there's some surprise companies in here Goldman Sachs has always been thought of as a big democratic company well actually in 2010 they switched and they were they became a heavily Republican supporting company so there's some very good stocks in this portfolio I don't think there's a sacrifice being you know I did not realize that because I just had it in my head that Goldman and a lot of these a lot of major corporations certainly a lot of Wall Streeters are backing Democrats they back the establishment so basically this fund would be like Hobby Lobby or something but yours you're saying actually a lot of these companies that we think are left-wing are trending toward Republican donations correct you know you can watch what they say or you can watch what they're doing with their money and I'm looking at what they're doing with their dog and they may come out and say one thing but there they're doing something else with their dollars and at the end of the day money matters in politics and when you're talking about lots and lots of money this is a lot of money that's being contributed it's affecting election outcomes so now go ahead well this is the you're absolutely right there are a lot of election outcomes that can be swayed by all of this but the elections themselves the campaign's themselves are even less clear in the world of Donald Trump because we see him sniping at bob Corker today little bob Corker we see him fighting with republicans fights very often that he hasn't picked fights that they're picking but will there be any implications for the Magga fund if there's a if there's a split if there's a rift between the GOP and Donald Trump will that be taken into account in the in the fund itself I don't think I don't think that it will affect things because at the end of the day they're gonna have to work with press and Trump and what he's doing when he's talking about bob Corker is hey this is a guy who's not necessarily supportive of some of the things that President Trump won on mmm and so what you know what's interesting about what president Trump's been able to do is you know he's gone after the NFL it's pretty interesting you think about it this is the story's been going on for over a year right yes pins been pumping this by the way ESPN's owned by Disney Disney's one of the top three contributors the Democratic Party of course I just kind of think about it from that perspective but Trump's gone after that what's happening in NFL well everybody else was silent this is going on for a year finally he stood up and said you know what we're not gonna put up with this that part of what you said earlier in your monologue I thought was great you know we're different than England people here the Republicans here a lot of times need to be scared of the media and Donald Trump's not scared of the media and he's gonna go out and stand and say what he thinks and a lot of the times he's right he's saying what everybody else is thinking and other people are afraid to say and the best part is if you go and you try to appease the media and you try to get them to like you and say I'm a conservative but I'm not that kind of conservative I'm not that kind of Republican that it's never enough it's never enough for them and Donald Trump has totally ignored that common common sense the common conception that we need to coddle up to the media and he's won every time I don't think it's ever blown up in his face no he's witty and he's winning big in this battle because at the end of the day you know the American people are on his side they're on the side of people standing for the flag there for the side of standing for the anthem absolutely and people ought to be invested in companies that are supportive of it I mean the left is not for this left one is fine with people sitting you know they're fine with the athletes they want to come out and talk about free speech that's right free speech I mean they can't wear a certain button on their on their on their uniform where they can't wear anything to honor the the victims and the heroes of 9/11 but and that's all fine but then when they're disrespecting the flag then it's a matter of free speech absolutely absurd well how I wish you the best of luck I think I'd probably would violate a thousand rules and regulations by by speaking too much about the fund itself but I do love the I think it's a lot of a great idea and a great way like Donald Trump who is attacking the culture and he's a cultural warrior I think it's a great way to just keep pushing and pushing and and bringing this fight on to their level and into their field and and be playing offense well I appreciate it and people can find me on Twitter at at mega index and as well they can go to invest politically calm and look at what's on the website so either one of those they can learn about it but you can buy this this ETF's traded everywhere yeah anyone that has a brokerage account can buy at the tickers mega and just call up your broker or if you trade online you can go online and buy it and that's that's as easy as that excellent all right got to go follow Hal on Twitter I know of course many of our listeners are just survivalists up in the hills of Montana who put every 100 percent of their portfolio into rations and ammo for the apocalypse but you know maybe consider diversifying your portfolio how thank you for being here I'm sure we'll have you back and talk again thank you okay now we have to bring on our panel of deplorable we have an excellent panel of deplorable today we have not only the birthday girl herself Emily Butler we have his eminence is royal eminence Paul Bois but I've got some bad news for you I have two I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if you are not a subscriber to the daily wire you will not be able to see them we can't talk about little bob Corker together we won't be able to talk about a Harvey Weinstein who's accused of raping all of Hollywood and anymore unfortunately you can't do that unless you go over to Daily wire calm right now thank you to everyone who has subscribed you help us keep the lights on you helped me afford three-piece tweed suits just just for your amusement just so that Marshall can have a little chuckle all day so thank you very much for that you'll get me you'll get the intro Clavin show you'll get the men Shapiro show you'll get no ads on the website I know blah blah blah blah blah wait a minute here it is here talk about institutions and traditions there is no tradition I think that I cherish more than every morning drinking delicious leftist tears to give me strength like spinach for Popeye and the only vessel that you should ever use to to gulp down those tasty tasty tears is the leftist years tumblr it's made out of crushed up little steven crowder a mug so it's really been hardened and you wanted any leaks you can have your leftist here's hot cold always salty and delicious go over to daily wire calm right now and we will be right back all right on that point Emily I want first your take on this political investing idea would you ever invest in companies or in a fund strictly for their political views well I think that question comes down to two questions which is one can I afford to do so and two what kind of a political statement do I want to make so on the first question probably not of course we know Pamela deployables doesn't pay that well not not so much no so might have to pick up a second job or two or three just to be able to put my money into the stock market but you know when facing with the kind of political statement I want to make you know I I'm kind of intrigued by it I think having the ability to decide specifically politically where your money is going I mean we talked about actually putting money into politics and things like that like I think as mr. Lambert said previously like all spending is political when you turn on the TV and you watch ESPN you hang money to Disney which is paying money to Democrats like every single choice we make influences the money in our politics and I would like to put my money behind representatives I believe in companies that believe in my representatives and to be honest I'd really think that people on the left the Hillary Clinton supporters the Bernie Sanders supporters probably don't even know enough about money to be investing in the stock market themselves they're socialists so their money should come from the government that's right well it just comes from the sky it falls down from the sky even though they also think there's a limited amount of it and it's a pie and the rich guy got that way by stealing the poor guy they have a complicated economics I've learned it's true it's true right well yeah I agree with that mr. Bois is this similar to boycotting shops that you don't like in stores that you don't like should we put our money where our political mouth is we run our mouths all day should we put our money there or should we invest in the most liberal companies if they make money very often they don't but assuming for the hypothetical they do make money should we just invest in them put our money wherever we're gonna get the return and then use all that money we make to support right-wing candidates when they run for office oh look I wish we could just live in a culture right now where we could put our money wherever we want we could go to whatever store we want we can invest wherever we want I mean I want that culture that's why I'm in this fight but unfortunately we're not in that culture we are in I think what is rightly described as a cold civil war where certain institutions that have a lot of power and a lot of money use that power and use that money for very nefarious ends and a lot of it is to curtail freedoms a lot of it is to attack Christianity and create an entirely new America where none of those values have any place in it so absolutely I fully support this portfolio and I fully support using your money in whatever way you can to support conservatives and not give it to liberals typical Paul Bois optimism everything's always rosy to you isn't it okay we have to move on to Harvey Weinstein raping all of Hollywood The New Yorker has published a bombshell report they've they've said that three women have accused Hollywood super producer and Democrat mega donor of rape there have been a ton of other women who have accused him of sexual assault and of sexual harassment including celebrities including Mira Sorvino Rosanna Arquette Bob wah you've lived in Hollywood a long time do you believe this report is it possible that such a supe super Hollywood producer and Democrat mega donor could really be a dirty rotten lowlife as Harvey Weinstein said Hollywood's the best moral compass there's no there's no sexual harassment in this industry come on I mean no in all seriousness yes I do believe the reports and I see no reason not to believe it one thing that's a quite striking is that all of them fit this pattern it's always Harvey Weinstein he invites some young good-looking actress up into a soda his staff is always there so they're comfortable first and then he asked him to leave and then once they're gone he takes off his clothes and does something really perverted and creepy so yes I fully believed the report and I think the man is getting his comeuppance and his downfall is long overdue this should have happened way back in the 1990's but you know what it's it's very unfortunate that it took this long get out this is another reason why British traditionalism gets it right these three-piece suits are very difficult to get off they really restrain the baser impulses of mankind if I were RV when I couldn't I can barely on button this if I'm looking in a mirror and taking ten minutes it would be a it's a profound statement and a sartorial statement to say that perhaps we ought to have some moral foundations and traditional institutions to rein in the debauched impulses of Hollywood's elite Emily how did he get away with this for so long you know Michael it's it's a real puzzler it's a head-scratcher and in an industry full of dirtbags how one dirtbag just managed just managed to get away you know I think the bigger question is really how at this point in his career did he finally come crumbling down and that's like that's an that's an aspect of it I'd actually like to explore more you know like Bill Cosby like how how these people finally get brought down because this is not isolated I mean you have to be you're so powerful and you're at such a level where Gweneth Paltrow is afraid to speak out against you Angelina Jolie all these other actresses who are fearful for you know their careers fearful for any sort of semblance of a life that they've built already you know in the brink of that span of time of whatever Harvey Weinstein wants to do with them or what Bill Cosby wants to do with people it's it's a question to me of how these things actually break and how finally the truth gets out and how the mighty actually toppled because this is not again this is not isolated there are hundreds of other people in this industry just like him and he's one of the biggest the baddest the toughest the meanest like he is the one who has the most accomplices who can just shut everyone down and the bravery that it takes to persevere in the face of that I mean now the the writers of the New York Times are getting slapped with a lawsuit like we knew they would and to have that that bravery to confront that and say you know no we're gonna push back on this because rape sexual assault so many of these things come down to a he-said she-said it's a very ugly crime it's a very nasty crime and it's also something that's very incredibly difficult to prove it's very difficult to prove I mean you can be with somebody an entire night like I can be with my husband we're having a great evening I we love each other like there's nothing there that sets up and in that moment between two people where some person says no stop that and the other person doesn't stop you know that's something that really comes down to he said or she said and especially when the other person is the biggest guy in this town for people who don't know who Harvey Weinstein is he I mean perhaps his influence is waning now clearly this seems to be his downfall this guy was the king I mean he was the biggest guy out here obviously these women are saying that he hurt their careers when they were rebuffed his advances and it's hard to see how that isn't true Sorvino did clearly had a decline in her career and for this town I've never mattered enough in Hollywood to really see this too closely or anything like that but a number of my friends have had this happen to them and I've heard the stories and I've been at some parties where where some shady-looking characters are praying you know where they're where they're speaking to young girls and surrounding themselves with young women it is it's not even an open secret in this town it is the currency of this town mr. Bois how did this guy get found out how did he fall apart now why now well I think the reason why now is like you said his power really is on the decline if this were five years ago or 10 years ago I don't think this would have come out I mean their report right now circulating about how there were photos taken by reporters in the early 2000s of him putting another reporter in a headlock and calling another reporter the c-word and that never got out because so many people in Hollywood media were on his payroll Hollywood Reporter a variety I mean they would literally buy up articles written by journalists and buy them up and you know optioned the rights for them you know they'd be having deals with Harvey Weinstein about getting their article turned into a movie or them writing a screenplay so get this guy owned so much of Hollywood and it just his power was on the decline and I would not be surprised this is of course more you know my more conspiratorial leanings well that's what you'd like to encourage that on the show of course so please yeah whatever bases you have I liken this to I mean I don't know if anybody out there is watching the show narcos right now but I liken this to basically like Sally cartel so the Cali cartel taking out Pablo Escobar you know someone one of his enemies in Hollywood a power broker somewhere gave the green light and it trickled down and now it's winding up on the New York Times I really find it hard to believe that this was just you know - Wylie reporters and they uncovered it and now the truth is out there and he's getting his justice I don't think so because like Emily said there's so many people in this industry he was too protected he was too pet mm-hmm yeah who do this kind of garbage and it's just coming out now because somebody wanted to take him out and get rid of him and clean up where he left off and take his investors and take his pipeline of influence that's what I think well moving now to Washington DC which is Hollywood for ugly people we have to discuss this Donald Trump little bob Corker spat he's back to bickering with his fellow Republicans bob Corker is the Republican nominee Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said he worries that Donald Trump will start World War 3 Donald Trump responded with typical trumpian subtlety and said that corker begged for his endorsement and Trump said no and that's why corker won't run for re-election next time who then said the white house is an adult daycare center and someone didn't show up for work today Trump then gave him a lovely moniker little bob Corker and like Lil Marco but with with two DS in it little mr. bois Trump is being called irresponsible and immature and reckless here but is he the one who started all these spats I mean look I never defend Trump's rhetoric in these situations but I always defend Trump's rhetoric but we'll get to that later I'm sorry but in all of these situations he's never attacking innocent people like bob Corker is stepping into the wrong here and he's he's lambasted the president in an interview with the New York Times when he's on his way out it's just cowardly and he's not even that conservative in the first place so honestly you know I never liked president Trump's rhetoric but at the same time bob Corker is not innocent and he's walking into it and he should know better that's true the rhetoric always sounds a little harsh or a little childish or whatever doesn't have the the effect of a Reagan's speech or Winston Churchill speech let's say to put it diplomatically but what are we defending bob Corker now I mean why this guy has an F report card from conservative review on his votes is a senator should we really be defending this guy or is Donald Trump the guy we ought to be defending oh no we should be defending Trump we we absolutely should be on Trump's side at the end of the day I mean look it's always it's a scale of moral imperatives at right now I mean yes it's not right that Trump is saying this kind of thing is calling someone little but the moral imperative right now of preserving what we're trying to do versus very an existential threat is right now much more important than just a personal feud between Trump and corker and by corker giving ammunition like that it it's harming it's it's damaging and and the real thing is if Donald Trump calling a liberal Republican squishy senator by some childish name if that's what's going to help us get conservative agenda passed if it's gonna help us get tax reform it's gonna help us get whatever and that's up for debate then do it man call him little maybe he is a little guy Emily birthday girl Butler would it be better for Trump to refrain from using the nicknames or isn't isn't that why we're here are you not entertained is that not why you have come I'm so pleased with season two season two of the gold house I tune in nightly I mean it's just fantastic but I you know I'm so torn on things like this like I like Trump for his rhetoric I voted for him because of his rhetoric because people everywhere especially people on the Left needed to see that rhetoric wasn't going to topple a country the way that everything was going with Hillary Clinton the way that she was talking the way that she's echoed everything in her book which still is just echoes that were tearing this country apart and you can always tell the people who are actually tearing the country apart when they say that this country will not be torn apart if we unite against those evil 40 million Americans yeah you know I mean it's it's ridiculous like the things that he says are ridiculous and I you know if I were on his advisory board I'd say don't even respond to this guy he's not worth it he's not worth the time people didn't know who he was before people don't care you're only making yourself look immature as we all know that he's doing but when it comes down to it there's nothing harmful that he's doing it's pedantic it's childish there's nothing harmful about this I don't necessarily see where there's anything helpful about this I don't necessarily see where it's gonna get a conservative agenda pushed through because he doesn't really have the media on its side to go like digging in through Bob corkers past that's kind of what the conservative media helps to do right so I don't is to a you know Tillerson there's this rumor that Tillerson called Donald Trump a moron the mainstream media that's every single question they're asking what do you think Tillerson called you a moron what do you say and he answered with his little joke and he said well I guess we'll have to get the IQ tests out I guess we'll have to do that he does always hits him back he's very off making jokes and listen I compared him to TS Eliot earlier in that show I do not regret it at all I think he has a similar traditionalism and they both use very evocative language to defend Western civilization there it is Donald Trump TS Eliot okay panel of deplorable z thank you for being here Paul Bois the birthday girl Emily Butler that's it that's my show that's all I've got to say today I've got jet lag I want to finish smoking my pipe so I'm gonna get out of here come back tomorrow this is the Michael Noel's show I am Michael Knowles get your mailbag questions in and we'll see you tomorrow
