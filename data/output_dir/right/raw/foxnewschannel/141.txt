1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:02,768
HORRIFIED.

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:03,101
TUCKER.

3
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:04,102
>> Tucker: THANK YOU, TRACE.

4
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:07,506
YOU WOULD THINK THAT VIOLENCE,

5
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,174
PHYSICAL ATTACKS AND THREATS IN

6
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,943
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM WOULD SHOCK

7
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,778
ALL OF US, BUT THIS POINT

8
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,679
UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY IS REALLY

9
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,046
SURPRISED.

10
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,113
IT ALMOST SEEMS NORMAL.

11
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,416
JUST LAST YEAR PROGRESSIVE

12
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,018
ACTIVIST TRY TO MURDER AN ENTIRE

13
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,920
FIELD OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS

14
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,322
PRACTICING BASEBALL.

15
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,057
HE GRAVELY WOUNDED ONE OF THEM.

16
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:25,824
STRANGELY YOU DIDN'T HEAR CALLS

17
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:26,825
FOR GUN CONTROL IN THE DAYS

18
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,528
AFTER THAT HAPPENED.

19
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,495
IN THIS POINT WE FORGOTTEN THAT

20
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:31,964
HAPPENED AT ALL.

21
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,367
SO THE CYCLE HAS ACCELERATED.

22
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,935
USING FORCE AGAINST REPUBLICAN

23
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,669
OFFICEHOLDERS AND CONSERVATIVES

24
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,437
NOW SEEMS LIKE A FEATURE OF OUR

25
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,073
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.

26
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:49,715
>> SHAME!

27
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,353
SHAME!

28
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:54,987
>> NO BORDERS, NO LOSS!

29
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,622
SANCTUARY FOR ALL!

30
00:00:57,623 --> 00:01:00,726
IF KIDS DON'T EAT IN PEACE, YOU

31
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,927
DON'T EAT IN PEACE!

32
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,729
>> Tucker: WHAT IS THIS REALLY

33
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,029
ABOUT?

34
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,731
SUDDENLY THIS KIND OF RAGE IS

35
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,164
EVERYWHERE.

36
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,332
YOU'VE SEEN TAPE LIKE THAT FOR

37
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,567
THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WHO

38
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,936
EXACTLY IS IT AIMED AT?

39
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,771
WHAT IS THE POINT?

40
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,939
WELL, REPUBLICANS, OBVIOUSLY,

41
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,574
ARE THE FOCUS OF IT.

42
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,142
IT CONSERVATIVES MORE GENERALLY.

43
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,643
ANYONE ELSE WHO DESCENDS FROM

44
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,779
ONE TRUE FAITH OF CULTURAL

45
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,113
LEFTISM.

46
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,148
BUT REALLY THE TARGET IS THE

47
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,782
COUNTRY ITSELF.

48
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,550
THE LEFT IS ANGRY AT AMERICA.

49
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,186
THEY SAY SO ALL THE TIME.

50
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:29,521
THIS IS NOT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

51
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,123
YOU GREW UP IN OR THAT YOU

52
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,591
REMEMBER IF YOU ARE OVER 30.

53
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,759
THAT PARTY MAY HAVE STOOD FOR

54
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,460
SOME BAD IDEAS, AND IT DID, BUT

55
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,962
THERE WAS NEVER REALLY A

56
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:37,662
QUESTION ABOUT ITS FUNDAMENTAL

57
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:39,231
LOYALTY TO AMERICA, OR THE

58
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,199
PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE.

59
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,335
THE PARTY OF FDR AND LBJ, EVEN

60
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,370
OF BILL CLINTON, WAS BASICALLY A

61
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:45,971
PATRIOTIC PARTY.

62
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,606
IT WAS AN AMERICAN PARTY.

63
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,141
NOT ANYMORE.

64
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,642
IN 2018, ANYONE WHO CONSIDERS

65
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,945
AMERICA A DISTINCT PHYSICAL

66
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,280
PLACE WITH MEANINGFUL BORDERS

67
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,581
AND ITS OWN HISTORY AND

68
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,283
TRADITIONS AND LANGUAGE AND

69
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,352
CULTURE AND VALUES, WON'T FEEL

70
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,120
COMFORTABLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC

71
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,821
PARTY, INDEED MAY NOT EVEN BE

72
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,990
ALLOWED IN THAT PARTY.

73
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,658
TO MODERN DEMOCRATS, THE LEADERS

74
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,760
OF THE PARTY, AMERICA IS AN

75
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,461
ECONOMY WITH LAND ATTACHED.

76
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,863
IT'S A MASSIVE PRIVATE EQUITY

77
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:13,732
SCHEME FROM WHICH THEY ARE

78
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,132
BENEFITING.

79
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,935
IT'S PEOPLE ARE INTERCHANGEABLE

80
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,136
HUMAN WIDGETS TO BE DISCARDED

81
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,305
AND PLACED WHEN THEIR USEFULNESS

82
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:20,672
EXPIRES.

83
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,174
WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY?

84
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,608
WASN'T ALWAYS WHAT AMERICA WAS

85
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:24,976
LIKE, YOU MIGHT ASK?

86
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:27,412
SHUT UP, THEY WILL EXPLAIN.

87
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,780
BEFORE OBAMA GOT ELECTED,

88
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,548
AMERICA WAS TRULY A HORRIBLE

89
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,150
PLACE, A NIGHTMARE.

90
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:32,884
WATCH NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW

91
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,753
CUOMO EXPLAINED.

92
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,420
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE

93
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,889
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

94
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,527
IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT.

95
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:44,196
>> Tucker: IT WAS NEVER THAT

96
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,263
GREAT, SAYS THE GUY WHO

97
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,532
INHERITED HIS JOB FROM HIS DAD.

98
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,467
HIS REMARKS GOT SOME COVERAGE ON

99
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,136
THIS CHANNEL, BUT THEY WERE

100
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,972
HARDLY UNUSUAL FOR CUOMO'S

101
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:54,739
PARTY.

102
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,741
BEFORE SHE FOUNDED THE #MeToo

103
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:57,642
MOVEMENT, SENATOR ELIZABETH

104
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:58,777
WARREN SPENT A LOT OF TIME

105
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,544
TELLING AUDIENCES WHAT AN AWFUL

106
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,780
COUNTRY THIS IS.

107
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,348
HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE.

108
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,883
>> THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT OUR

109
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,152
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, IT'S

110
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,653
RACIST.

111
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:14,626
[APPLAUSE]

112
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,062
>> I MEAN FRONT TO BACK.

113
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,932
>> Tucker: RACIST, FRONT TO

114
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:21,233
BACK.

115
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,501
IN OTHER WORDS, OUR LAWS AND OUR

116
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,436
POLICE ARE ILLEGITIMATE AND THEY

117
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,670
ARE IMMORAL.

118
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:26,905
DON'T WORRY ABOUT VIOLATING OR

119
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:27,339
IGNORING THEM.

120
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,343
TEXAS SENATE CANDIDATE ROBERT

121
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,246
O'ROURKE RECENTLY TOLD A CROWD

122
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,747
THAT POLICE IN AMERICA MURDER

123
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,414
AND IMPRISON PEOPLE SOLELY

124
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,551
BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN COLOR.

125
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,452
THAT'S FACTUALLY UNTRUE.

126
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,853
IT'S RIDICULOUS, AND OF COURSE,

127
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,421
HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO PROVE IT

128
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,991
WAS TRUE, BUT IT'S ALSO A SLUR

129
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,059
ON DECENT PEOPLE OF ALL COLORS

130
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,027
FOR TRYING THEIR BEST TO SERVE

131
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,597
THIS COUNTRY AND LAW ENFORCEMEN

132
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,300
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

133
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:55,934
DEMOCRATS SHOULD HAVE SAID

134
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:56,668
SOMETHING, BUT THEY DIDN'T, THEY

135
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,702
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO, NOBODY IS.

136
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:00,038
DEFEND AMERICA AND YOU WILL BE

137
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,405
PUNISHED.

138
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,339
FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN MARY BONO

139
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,141
LOST HER JOB THIS WEEK AS

140
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:03,808
PRESIDENT OF USA GYMNASTICS.

141
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:06,578
WHAT DID SHE DO WRONG?

142
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,312
SHE LEVELED A VEILED CRITICISM

143
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,813
AT COLIN KAEPERNICK.

144
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:12,117
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE NO.

145
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,718
COLIN KAEPERNICK MAKES MILLIONS

146
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,352
DENIGRATING OUR NATIONAL

147
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:14,686
SYMBOLS.

148
00:04:14,687 --> 00:00:00,000
HE'S A HERO, NIKE HIRED HIM.
