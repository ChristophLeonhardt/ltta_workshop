1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
people wanted what was outlined to them

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,300
in their country's constitution they

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,130
wanted to democratically elect a

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,410
president and we'll see you know in the

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">next hundred twenty days if that happens</font>

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,710

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,060
last week we were there to see Michelle

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">Martelli</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stepped down and saw the</font>

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,810
country choose its new interim president

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,850
so Michael<font color="#CCCCCC"> what awesome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people do we</font>

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,559
have on the show today we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,360
awesomest people in the entire world I

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,940
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of them are here let's</font>

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,620
start with kush he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome cuz</font>

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right here curse you</font>

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,610

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,309
dilemmas can we solve for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you today</font>

19
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:48,450
awesome that I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good name</font>

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,160
um so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest questions are</font>

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,100
first off why is it so difficult to even

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,440
find out what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in Haiti if you</font>

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,989
do a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google search very little</font>

24
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,120
even pops up and then because of that

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,060
I'm curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know what</font>

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,430
protesters really want is it an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of</font>

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,280
political transparency this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of to</font>

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,600
me seems like a slap in the face to

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,180
democracy but I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,830
sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the protesters want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,490
how what specific changes they they want

32
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,680
the government to make yeah those are

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">great questions and so to talk about</font>

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,070
your first one why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we see a lot of</font>

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">people covering Haiti well it's tough</font>

36
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,689
because it's again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really hard</font>

37
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,820
to communicate a story a story to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,770
audience that might seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

39
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,840
affect them so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few outlets</font>

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,520
that cover it really closely and have

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,290
journalists at our baser that that are

42
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,270
their correspondence so for example i

43
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,159
really like Jacqueline Charles who's the

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Caribbean correspondent of the Miami</font>

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,549
Herald she covers that region very well

46
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:48,930
but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> right for most other</font>

47
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,490
mainstream networks is kind of a block

48
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,710
out on what's going on in Haiti and for

49
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,939
us at vice news we thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

50
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">really important story to cover we</font>

51
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,780
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it looked like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,850
have the you know the guy who's in

53
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,219
charge during the during the earthquake

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,869
to step down and who would fill that

55
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,729
vacuum so we felt it was important and

56
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,038
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were there and the second</font>

57
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of your question if just to remind</font>

58
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,090
myself you're asking what do protesters

59
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,150
really want what we're

60
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,519
they really angry about yeah so what

61
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,640
specifically are they angry about I was

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,670
a political transparency and then what

63
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,790
specific changes if any do they want the

64
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,920
government to make yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely so I</font>

65
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">think first I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw to this</font>

66
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,700
clip which might put it into a little

67
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,400
bit of context it's going to show it's

68
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,780
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show Simon interviewing a</font>

69
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,060
protester in Haiti last week the

70
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">population is angry now do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's a potential for more</font>

72
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,239
violence if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martelli doesn't step down</font>

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,060
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> well yeah definitely if he</font>

74
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">spit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on 70 yeah doubt that there's gonna</font>

75
00:02:52,269 --> 00:03:03,549
be a lot of die so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put that into</font>

76
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,079
a little bit of context for you that

77
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,000
protester what he was referring to was

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,040
he wanted president<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michel Martelly to</font>

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,540
step down at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of his five-year</font>

80
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,879
term which he ended up doing last week

81
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,459
and the issue there was that there was a

82
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,079
big question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was going to lead</font>

83
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,000
the country next Michel Martelly had

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,370
someone in mind that you know a lot of a

85
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,709
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people felt like he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was the wrong</font>

86
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,180
choice he's just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to be</font>

87
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,980
a puppet so yes people really do want

88
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,260
transparency in the sense that I got is

89
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know people wanted what was</font>

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,560
outlined to them in their country's

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,790
constitution they wanted to

92
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,370
democratically elect a president and

93
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what the people really want to do</font>

94
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,459
and we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

95
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,139
hundred twenty days if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

96
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah did that answer your questions for</font>

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,650
ya yeah overall I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they</font>

98
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,979
just elected the parliament voted on a

99
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,409
new president correct and is there had

100
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,650
been any kind of protest about that

101
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,109
process and I know it was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday</font>

102
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,780
right yes yeah so it's kind of

103
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,099
interesting it definitely seemed a

104
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,169
little house of cards Frank Underwood

105
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">esque and a lot of people called it a</font>

106
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,340
parliamentary coup because the gentleman

107
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,470
who became president excuse me Jocelyn

108
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,750
pre there he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> senator he was a</font>

109
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,489
senator of Haiti and one of the three

110
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,690
people that came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with this whole plan</font>

111
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,940
to elect a temporary president in the

112
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,130
first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> so indeed yes it was the</font>

113
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Parliament who chose the leader of the</font>

nation and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know his mandate is to be</font>

US are paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're next-door</font>

Sunday we went out and we're chatting

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,979
with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the street and it seemed</font>

135
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">like there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were no protests</font>

136
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,270
because everyone wanted this interim you

137
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,370
know transitional period of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Haiti to go</font>

138
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,960
on they wanted this to happen and

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,340
there's everyone's just really looking

140
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,870
forward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to democratically</font>

141
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,539
elect a president in 120 days so it

142
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,520
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get this</font>

143
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,380
over with as smoothly as possible and

144
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,229
you know why maybe doesn't America care

145
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,169
about Haiti I mean it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems again</font>

146
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,610
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to get people to</font>

147
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about an issue that's not directly</font>

148
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,680
affecting them right now and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the u.s.</font>

153
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,320
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be picking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking presidents over</font>

154
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,450
might be taking precedence rather over

155
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,240

money of them and the haiti is about you

172
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,320

173
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,550
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you saying hey let's me</font>

174
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,190
so like a triangle they are like trade

175
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,700
and you know yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely I mean I</font>

176
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,430
you know why maybe aren't we investing

177
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,960
in Haiti or other companies looking to

178
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,340
invest there that's a really good

179
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,380
question I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

180
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,820
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recognize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Haiti it</font>

181
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,680
once was you know the region's top

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,540
exporter of bananas like they do have

183
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,580
they can get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trade in a</font>

184
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,140
meaningful way and they could also be a

185
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,760
top coffee exporter and other things

186
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that but unfortunately it's just</font>

187
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,540
the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> has so much political</font>

188
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,610
instability that it makes it hard for

189
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,140
investors to want to put their money

190
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there because they may not know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

191
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,470
fate of their company or the country's

192
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,940
government might be in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

193
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,010
days so that unfortunately is a big

194
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,200
barrier keeping any trade from happening

195
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,670
you know right now during this

196
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,710
instability does that answer your

197
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,380
question you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second per</font>

198
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,390
my question you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a catch-22</font>

199
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on instability you know where</font>

200
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,700
investors leads with more instability

201
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,430
kind of you know like a big cycle yeah

202
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,740
no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I hope that they can get</font>

203
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,480
involved shortly but we'll have to kind

204
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,670
of see how you know politics plays out

205
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,810
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country cuz that's gonna really</font>

206
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,490
lead whether or not they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

207
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,730
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trade okay that's sounds</font>

208
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,490
very questions awesome thanks so much no

209

212
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,670
this is a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

213
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,730
explainer for everybody watching at home

214
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,890
the new president Felix wants to know is

215
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,350
he temporary or have they actually done

216
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,850
a presidential<font color="#CCCCCC"> election can you explain</font>

217
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,800
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of the process of how the</font>

218
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,720
president<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new president came to</font>

219
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,010
power yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an exciting 12 hour it</font>

220
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,080
was a 12-hour National Assembly session

221
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,580
to pick the interim president so yes on

222
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,050
Saturday<font color="#CCCCCC"> night early Sunday morning is</font>

223
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,270
when joseline pre bear was chosen by the

224
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,400
National Assembly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the interim</font>

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,620
president and so far his mandate says

226
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,800
that he only has 120 days so essentially

227
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">he came up with this plan with another</font>

228
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,080
senator and Michelle<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martelli to create</font>

229
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,190
this mandate for the temporary

230
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,860
presidency and people thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

231
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,630
weird again<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we mentioned before</font>

232
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,550
that he ended up being the leading

233
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,960
candidate despite the fact that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

234
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this plan in the first place and</font>

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,980
yes his colleagues from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the National</font>

236
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,510
Assembly chosen and he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lead</font>

237
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:51,720
the

238
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">trade for 120 days all right well there</font>

239
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,790
is your answer Felix I hope you are

240
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,459
satisfied<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that and without any</font>

241
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,019
further ado I know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam who</font>

242
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,519
wants to ask us about some tumultuous

243
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,189
issues that were happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> haiti</font>

244
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:07,920
after you there yeah hi Neelu<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the</font>

245
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,899
CEO big<font color="#CCCCCC"> time fan I was wondering back to</font>

246
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,269
the process I mean you had mentioned I

247
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:17,459
think in your dispatch that there was a

248
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,990
big it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an endurance test so what</font>

249
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,579
made it an endurance test I mean

250
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:23,009
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> was 12 hours long but you'd</font>

251
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,420
mention that the Senators I think who

252
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,000
had voted towards the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end had more power</font>

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,129
or like had more say like what gave them

254
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:33,120
more yeah i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean i will say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

255
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,810
this for me was the most marathon

256
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,250
endurance testing a parliamentary

257
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,899
session I've ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my life so to</font>

258
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:40,949
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a background</font>

259
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,699
the session that day started<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 5pm a</font>

260
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,470
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they said kick all</font>

263
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,410

264
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,269

<font color="#CCCCCC">mandate of the rules if they didn't</font>

270

start voting before midnight this whole

271
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:07,139
plan was completely scrapped so they

272
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,819
started voting at eleven-thirty their

273
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:11,279
first round<font color="#E5E5E5"> of voting was a split vote</font>

274
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,559
between the top two candidates LeBlanc

00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vert and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so they had to do</font>

00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:26,220
on when they came back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote the</font>

283
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,670

284
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,290
and wheeling and dealing we're

285
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,199

286
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,660

287
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,939
really pushing these politicians like

288
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,439
how long can you stay awake like if

289
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,329
someone had left the room for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example it</font>

290
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:46,769
would have completely changed the voting

291
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,180
structure and whether or not they could

292
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">vote that night so it was really keeping</font>

293
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,829
these guys in a room and seeing who they

294
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:54,269
would vote for in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end and in the end</font>

298
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,189
reaction to that like were they covering

299
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:04,889
it I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't does it like mirror</font>

ton of camera crews at the end I mean

306
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,980
when he was when primera was chosen as

307

typical to what you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen in</font>

for interim president because you were

one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> politicians who came up with</font>

362

367
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,740
context for that we waited around for

368
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,140
him for about five hours to get a

369
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">10-minute interview so we had to ask the</font>

370
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,980
questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew that would piss</font>

371
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,370
him off basically immediately and so as

372
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,930
you can kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> see in the interview</font>

373
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,340
when we asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him if he would step down</font>

374
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,590
in 120 days no matter what he did the

375
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,070
amazing typical politicians speak of

376
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,870
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of talking in circles and oh</font>

377
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,790
there's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much to do in 120 days the</font>

378
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,980
mandate clearly says 120 days but he

379
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,100
never said yes I will step down and

380
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,450
again when we asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him do you feel at</font>

381
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,220
Shady that you're a leading candidate

382
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,480
despite the fact that you made this plan

383
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,610
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rules clearly state that a</font>

384
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,700
Haitian citizen can be that can come in

385
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,050
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this temporary presidency and I'm a</font>

386
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,660
Haitian citizen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely seemed</font>

387
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,520
very frank underwood to me so I'm kind

388
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,170
of interested to follow and see what

389
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,960
this looks like so then how realistic

390
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,360
will elections taking place in 120 days

391
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,980
seem like he might not step down on his

392
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,360
own volition<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like will there be</font>

393
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,640
another campaign will there be another

394
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
round of elections I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

395
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,000
are definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Haitian people</font>

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,010
are definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hungry to directly</font>

397
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,540
elect their president so I know they

398
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,510
want it to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know who it's</font>

399
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,520
it's so hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell I mean what i can</font>

400
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,110
say is that during<font color="#CCCCCC"> Primera's</font>

401
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,150
inauguration speech he talked a lot

402
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,790
about the country coming together

403
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,900
freedom for the press being important

404
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,000
but not once did he<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned hey we're</font>

405
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,410
definitely going to elect this president

406
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,730
he didn't mention the fact that there

407
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,130
was going to be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> election so that was</font>

408
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,650
conveniently left out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his speech so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

409
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,420
would i would like power to be handed

410
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,520
over smoothly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like to see the people</font>

411
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,589
of haiti get to elect their president

412
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,330
but i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gonna happen in</font>

413
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,700
120 days and what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest</font>

414
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,680
differences between the new president

415
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martelli then really like really</font>

416
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,730
close um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not too sure I mean they</font>

417
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,050
definitely I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean they're from different</font>

418
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,740
political parties<font color="#E5E5E5"> provera I guess his</font>

419
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,110
biggest thing is that he was the chair

420
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,940
the National Assembly so he had a lot of

421
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,670
pull and influence in the parliament but

422
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,709
you know to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest I I don't</font>

423
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,060
personally see a difference between them

424
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,709
I'm but I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pretend that</font>
