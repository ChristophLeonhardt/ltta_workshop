ITS MAXIMUM PRESSURE THAT SEALED

00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:47,399
THE POLICY IN NORTH KOREA?

26
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,401
>> THE POLICY HAS NOT CHANGED.

27
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:50,736
AS THE PRESIDENT STATED, WE HAVE

28
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:52,438
SANCTIONS ON, VERY POWERFUL, AND

29
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:53,172
WILL NOT TAKE THE SANCTIONS OFF

30
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:56,642
UNLESS NORTH KOREA AGREES WITH

31
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:56,909
US.

32
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,010

PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS.

GOOD TO SEE YOU.

THANK YOU, ALWAYS, FOR BEING

BACK WITH US.

38
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,619
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- THIS IS

39
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:07,653
REALLY SIMPLE ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

40
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:09,321
SO FAR, WE KNOW THAT ONE NUCLEAR

41
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,624
TEST SITE IS SHUT DOWN.

42
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:13,859
WE KNOW THAT HE ACROSS THE DMZ,

43
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,127
RELEASE THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES.

44
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:16,829
WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE

45
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:17,329
DENUCLEARIZATION.

46
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,632
AND AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE

47
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:20,466
UNITED STATES AND THE PRESIDENT

48
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,734
HAVE NOT PAID A DIME FOR ANY OF

49
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:23,636
THAT.

50
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:24,236
TRUE?

51
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:25,638
>> TRUE.

52
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:27,940
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT HAS CONCEDED

53
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,541
NOTHING.

54
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,309
AND THE SANCTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

55
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:32,044
ON-SITE WILL WILL CONTINUE TO BE

56
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:32,611
ON PLACE.

57
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,113
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID ON FRIDAY,

58
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,482
THIS IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION,

59
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:38,217
AND HE LOOKS FORWARD TO THIS

60
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:38,617
MEETING.

61
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:40,219
HE THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE A

62
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,420
VERY GOOD AND PRODUCTIVE MEETING

63
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,588
AND IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF

64
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:44,957
THIS PROCESS, BUT HE CERTAINLY

65
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:46,358
THINGS THAT JUNE 12TH IS GOING

66
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:47,860
TO BE A GOOD MEETING AND HE

67
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,627
CERTAINLY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO

68
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:51,630
DOING THAT HERE IN THE NEXT

69
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,931
WEEK.

70
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,599
>> Sean: I THINK THE PRESIDENT

71
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,234
ALSO IS VERY SMART IN TRYING TO

72
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:56,268
MANAGE EXPECTATIONS.

73
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:58,037
NOTHING IS GOING TO BE SIGNED IT

74
00:01:58,037 --> 00:01:59,338
NEXT WEEK, THIS WILL GO AS FAST

75
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,840
OR SLOW AS NORTH KOREA WANTS.

76
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,042
THE SANCTIONS REMAIN IN PLACE.

77
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,243
IF THERE WAS ANOTHER MISSILE

78
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:05,578
FIRED, WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT

79
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,246
WILL PROBABLY SEND OR STRIKE

80
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:10,282
FORCES RIGHT BACK ON THE

81
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,251
KOREAN PENINSULA, IF NEED BE.

82
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:13,919
IT SEEMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE

83
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,920
PRESIDENT PULLED OUT FOR A

84
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,423
PERIOD, HE MEANS WHAT HE SAYS.

85
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:19,558
HE'S WILLING TO WALK AWAY AT ANY

86
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:20,859
TIME.

87
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,261
>> 100%.

88
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,662
THE PRESIDENT IS EXTREMELY

89
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:25,631
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS PROCESS.

90
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,966
ULTIMATELY, HE WANTS TO SEE THE

91
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,100
NEW REALIZATION OF THE

92
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,467
PENINSULA.

93
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,637
THAT IS THE TOP GOAL HERE,

94
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:32,805
THAT'S WHAT HE'S FOCUSED WITH

95
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:37,610
THE TALKS WAS UNDER ON.

96
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,844
THIS MAY TAKE TIME.

97
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,312
THIS MAY NOT TAKE TIME OVER THE

98
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:40,946
COURSE OF ONE MEETING BUT

99
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,681
SEVERAL MEETINGS.

100
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,416
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THAT

101
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:44,783
DIALOGUE.

102
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:47,386
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE A

103
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:55,027
COMMITTED AND FIRM TO IT.

104
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:57,363
HE HAS A GOOD FEELING OF HOW

105
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:58,897
THIS FIRST MEETING WILL GO.

106
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,032
>> Sean: I UNDERSTAND HOW THE

107
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:01,200
MEDIA IS, SO THE PRESIDENT HAS

108
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,470
KEPT ALL OF HIS PROMISES OF

109
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,107
GETTING RID OF BURDENSOME

110
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,643
REGULATION, BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND

111
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:11,577
HISTORIES, MOVING THE COUNTRY

112
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:12,278
TOWARDS ENERGY INDEPENDENCE.

113
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:14,613
YOU CAN SEE THE PRESIDENT IS

114
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:15,381
FIGHTING ON ALL ISSUES REGARDING

115
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:17,016
THE BORDER AND THE WALL.

116
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:19,818
I KNOW IT'S 500 DAYS IN.

117
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:21,453
HE KEPT HIS WORD ON JERUSALEM,

118
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,522
THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL, PULLING

119
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:24,623
OUT OF THE RADIANT DEAL IF

120
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:25,891
YOU'RE NOBODY REALLY EXPECTED,

121
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:26,825
STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAN

122
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:28,761
STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MA,

123
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:28,794
STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAT

124
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:28,827
STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAI

125
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:29,228
STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MAS

126
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:29,795
STARTED OUT AS LITTLE ROCKET MA.

127
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,864
I WATCH YOU EVERY DAY AND I

128
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:35,834
WATCHED TODAY, ALL THE FOCUS IS,

129
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,269
YOU TOLD US IN 2017 THE

130
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,137
PRESIDENT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

131
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:41,440
THE COMMENTS OF DON JR., I'M

132
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,207
THINKING THAT EVERY REPORT SHOWS

133
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:45,344
THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID,

134
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:46,779
THAT THE FACT THAT THE MEETING

135
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:49,982
WAS ALL ABOUT -- ALL THE EMAILS

136
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:52,184
PROVING TO BE ABOUT TALKING

137
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:54,920
ABOUT ADOPTION, THE FACT IS THAT

138
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,555
AT THE END OF THE REPORT, THEY

139
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,590
TOLD THE TRUTH.

140
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,458
ISN'T THAT THE BIGGER PICTURE

141
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:03,228
THAT IS MISSED TONIGHT?

142
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:05,397
>> CERTAINLY THAT IS ONE OF THE

143
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:06,665
BIG THINGS MISSED TONIGHT, BUT I

144
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:07,800
THINK THE BIGGEST STORY BEING

145
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,934
MISSED TONIGHT, AND I SAW TODAY

146
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:11,003
IN THE ROOM, THEY ASKED ME 100

147
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,038
QUESTIONS ON THE FAKE WITCH HUNT

148
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:14,573
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FIXATED ON

149
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,708
THESE LAST 500 DAYS, BUT THEY

150
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,810
FORGOT TO MENTION THAT DON'T

151
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,079
LIKE ABOUT THINGS AMERICANS CARE

152
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,613
ABOUT LIKE THE BOOMING ECONOMY.

153
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:22,715
WE HAVE THE BEST ECONOMY WE'VE

154
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:24,550
HAD SINCE WORLD WAR II.

155
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,552
THEY HAVE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT

156
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:27,186
THAT.

157
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,821
THE STOCK MARKET IS GROWING.

158
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:30,422
PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE JOBS.

159
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:31,523
PEOPLE WHO NEED JOBS AND WANTS

160
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:33,392
JOBS CAN GET THEM.

161
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,027
I MEAN, THE FACT THAT WASN'T

162
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,161
SOMETHING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT,

163
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,763
THAT WASN'T BROUGHT UP, THAT WAS

164
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:40,699
TOTALLY IGNORED, THE FACT THAT

165
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,234
ISIS IS ON THE RUN AND BEING

166
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,635
DEFEATED DAY AFTER DAY AND WE

167
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:44,903
ARE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION

168
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:45,904
THAN EVER BEFORE WHEN IT COMES

169
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:48,040
TO THAT BATTLE, THE FACT THE

170
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,441
PRESIDENT HAS COMPLETELY REMADE

171
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,643
THE JUDICIARY, THE FACT THAT WE

172
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:53,178
ARE BECOMING AN ENERGY

173
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:53,912
INDEPENDENT AND ENERGY DOMINANT

174
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:57,383
COUNTRY UNDER THIS RESIDENT'S

175
00:04:57,383 --> 00:04:58,117
LEADERSHIP, THEY IGNORE ALL THE

176
00:04:58,117 --> 00:04:59,385
SUCCESSES OF THIS PRESIDENT

177
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,786
AND IT'S TO THEIR DETRIMENT.

178
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:01,920
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE

179
00:05:01,920 --> 00:00:00,000
SEEN IT AND THAT IS WHY THE
