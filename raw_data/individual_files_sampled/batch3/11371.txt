hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle America is a house deeply divided and that division only continues the entire Brett Kavanaugh saga has turned into bloodsport demanding each and every one of us pick a side we're in new territory and that place is called winner-takes-all crosstalking cultural wars I'm joined by my guest Christopher Neil I'm in Washington he's a Republican strategist in Los Angeles we have Robert Barnes he is a trial lawyer in criminal and constitutional law and in Chagin ago we cross to Brian Joyce he's the host of the Brian Joyce show all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it who gets to go first well the guy that got up early is for this program and that means it's Robert in Los Angeles okay it's talk about the Brett Kavanaugh thing and a much broader cultural and political sense here what does it represent to you because I can i I I'm even willing to in my introduction is a bit over the top but I'm trying to make a point here because it does seem like we're in an era an epoch where one wins and one loses and that is not part of the American tradition go ahead Robert no doubt we have these evidentiary standards and due process standards and legal standards that we've created over hundreds of years in the United States and basically all of them are being scratched and scrapped overnight and what's happening is we're you know I'm just waiting for when the next nominee comes up they said well when he was in kindergarten he pulled Susie's hair so I mean it's getting to that kind of place where we're going back 20 years 30 years 40 years we're going back to disputed events and what happened at a party on a particular night and when we get to that place then at some point we're no longer in a place where truth matters were no longer a place where justice matters and where the me2 era has gotten has gone so far out of reach that it's no longer about justice or fairness it's solely about power and it is about just who wins and who loses okay Brook Brian the criticism of the lefty through this I think this uh turn on sense I'm sorry that's my opinion of the whole thing is that the left just continues to move the goalposts and they're being very disingenuous when they say they want justice I think Robert already said it they just want power because advise and consent is about if you're competent to serve on the court that's all the Senate committee is really supposed to ask how do you respond to moving the goalposts go ahead Brian well I think it's absolutely true Democrats are playing politics with this nomination and they're trying to delay the nomination but to that point I would argue why shouldn't they I mean when you talk about well really the only litmus test should be shouldn't this person be qualified for the court we did have somebody who was qualified for the court in Merrick garland and last I checked it was the Republican Party not Democrats who left him sitting on the bench without a hearing for a year now they're trying to shove Brett Kavanaugh through in a month or less why did Mitch McConnell leave Merrick garland who was a phenomenally qualified justice why did he leave him sitting there for a year without even giving him the decency of a hearing I think what Democrats are doing here is they're taking the obstructionism and they're just shoving it right back in the face of Republicans I think it's just par for the course in Washington DC okay fair enough Christopher but one could make the argument I certainly would make the argument that this is different in the sense that it's just not playing politics it's really it's destroying a process and it's destroying a tradition I mean sure fine you get your power but what's it worth when you don't have a process that is that everyone could agree to and I think this is that the the new territory were in go ahead Christopher in Washington I think you're correct I think that the real loser here is the American a citizen in terms of the faith in the process their faith and what's true what's not true I think the truth is the furthest thing from the interest of all these try of tribal forces I think you're right Peter there's almost kind of puts you in this default position of which tribal side am I going to gravitate to and the way that news is presented it so viciously partisan one way or the other in terms of that now in terms of some of the other commentary that was just presented I would agree that you know why are they trying to advance this because they're politicians who don't care about anything except for getting what they want it's hip it's hypocrisy we know that but the question is how has the way that's been presented has it been healthy and I think it's not because true is not what's being sought here okay Robert you know in looking at this whole thing I think it's gotten down to performance anger and destruction theater again it may be this judge drank a lot in college when I was in college and a lot of people drank but he was at the top of his class he's dead at the top of everything he's ever pursued here okay again he has the merits of doing that when I look at all this destruction theater and performance anger they never talk about his achievements the left it seems to me does not like competence in and this is part of this weaponization of the me2 movement go ahead Robert in Los Angeles no doubt everything about this has come across like a old-style Soviet style show trial it feels like watching those old documentary videos of Cuba in the early 1960s where it is all about theater where it is all about drama where it is all about the show and the the frightening thing is that not only are so is the Senate advice and consent process supposed to be a hallowed constitutional process that follows a certain set of standards but there's no equal set of standards being applied I mean here you have congressman Ellison who there's allegations against where they're going to dismiss those allegations because they said well there's not corroborate or evidence there is an independent sufficient evidence to proceed and yet as to cabinet entirely different standards are being applied so it's if we're gonna go down that police V we used to have there is yes there is some evidence there that a complaint was made here go finish up Robert in Los Angeles go ahead so we value equal standards because we want the same standards to be applied to us when we are on the opposite side of the equation and I understand the approach of the Democrats in the sense of saying well politically you obstructed so we're gonna obstruct but they're doing so at the expense of due process they're doing so at the expense of evidentiary standards that have been well established for more than 200 years they're doing so at the expense altom Utley if the me2 movement who will be discredited in part by this show trial by this fake trial that took place Brian in Chattanooga reflect upon how the media particularly the liberal media and I'm thinking of The Washington Post CNN MSNBC I mean there again they've injected themselves into this process here I mean this latest allegation of the serial rape gang my goodness I watched that interview on NBC I mean NBC should be ashamed of itself that they even ask the woman the questions before they went on to tape it I mean not only that she looked like a fool NBC looked like even a bigger fool because they're injecting themselves into this here Brian please reflect on that yeah if you think NBC knows is bad you should try watching Fox News you know I I didn't catch the piece that you're talking about the media does what the media does they use stories that's what they're supposed to do if they cover their own political bent well again that's just sort of par for the course which is where we are in the United States but I want to go back to something you know what you were making the point that liberals just seem to be battling this man Kavanagh on any front that they can and they just don't want to see a competent conservative justice on the court I would remind you that Neil Gorsuch never faced this kind of scrutiny he never faced these kind of accusations John Roberts never faced these kind of accusations and on the other side of the aisle neither did Elena Kagan or Sonia Sotomayor I mean the fact of the matter is we've had three different justices in the past ten years placed on the Supreme Court two Democrats one Republican none of them face these allegations I mean up sitting that says you don't think I don't sit there I don't think the evidence there to conclude that that bread Kavanagh is a serial sex predator I think there's more than enough evidence to suggest that he was a little bit of a wild child and the reason why these allegations are coming out and they didn't come out on say Neil Gorsuch is because there are none of these allegations against all right Chris Orr so if I can just take a kind of you know condense what Brian just said there then then allegation is conviction okay but I don't understand that that's the way that's the leap of faith I don't agree with don't understand think it is wrong okay just just because other people weren't accused does it mean Kavanagh is guilty go ahead I mean first I mean I agree with with Robert in terms of the process and my recommendation was I don't think these confirmation hearing should be televised any more I think we should be able to hear them and read transcripts and actually look at the rule of life like everything has just become so so fanatical and then for Bryant I wouldn't disagree but I think Fox has been more than fair I think so too that dr. Ford seems very credible and that it's been concerning here's my only issue is here's my issue I don't believe it's a civic duty to hold something for 35 years and then to come out and refuse to do it in your home state of California and when you got the Democratic Party coming out there saying well many people are trying to recruit mr. avenatti to run for president here's a guy who represents adult film stars digging up fake news stories left and right and that's going to be the guy to take the lead and it's no surprise because as let's just point it out there's a police report with keith Ellison there is evidence and you have the woman that's running to replace him in Congress saying well the first thing I'm gonna do is impeach the president and when asked what she to pitch him on she had no clue what she was talking about so and we've got the list goes on senator gillibrand I really really believe dr. Ford you're friends with Harvey Weinstein I mean the Democrats have absolutely become uncredible from head to toe on issues of sexual assault in my view okay let me go to rock let me go to Robert before we go to the break here I mean if you look at the pattern from the let float forward letter that got to a fine scene all the way to now convinced me it wasn't all pre-planned and packaged convinced me it wasn't go ahead Robert sure I mean I think the only thing that could defend a Ford is that she does give off signs of a misplaced memory so I defended a lot of people that have been victimized by various forms of abuse and salt and I learned early on how to try to distinguish between what was a good case and what was not a good case and she gives all the signs of a bad case now that means that she could possibly sincerely believe it and she could have misattribution issues so that for her it may not be a politically manipulated event I have no doubt however that senator Feinstein and her so-called attorneys in this case were in fact politically manipulating this from beginning and so I think that the only question is whether Ford was a Co complicit participant or just another victim of a politicized witch-hunt process that has made the advice and consent process into sort of a laughing stock and a joke and well boy TV well just we're gonna say we're gonna have to go to a break here but Rachel Mitchell she is a compelling person in what she wrote we might talk about that after our break after our short break we'll continue our discussion on political correctness in the United States stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on peter Lavelle Tremonti we're discussing america's deep divide okay let me go back to Brian Brian Pat Buchanan came out with a very interesting piece in the last couple of days you know I read it in the new can the American Conservative and essentially what he's saying is that the this whole saga around Kavanagh is a preamble for the Democrats if they retake the house after the midterms to impeach Donald Trump do you do you agree with that is that his argument is really quite compelling go ahead Brian I think maybe it's a bridge too far a leap too far to say that Democrats will automatically move for impeachment but the fact of the matter is I have no doubt that Democrats will do their job and investigate Donald Trump for which he should be investigated their the the amount of scandal surrounding this White House is absolutely unprecedented the Republicans have no backbone or political will to dig into any of this stuff whatsoever if they sort of Democrat in the White House obviously that Democratic president would have already been impeached we know this so you know again I think what's fair is fair and what's just as just I would expect Democrats to move at least in the direction of investigations into the Trump administration the FBI is already doing that obviously robert muller is already doing that you know in impeachment I don't know if they'll go straight for impeachment Christopher in Washington what do you think because I'll express my humble opinion well the Democrats don't need any facts they just want conclusions that they want I mean it seems quite obvious to me I mean the Cavanaugh case is a perfect example there I mean it's so scant on on on evidence it's it's it's it would be laughed out of court I mean I guess Robert could speak to that okay but Christopher I really think it's a it's providing the popular culture right now it started the universities now and it says it's a winner take oh I get everything shut up nod your head and do what you're told that's it in a nutshell Christopher I'd largely agree I mean I I would disagree that this is unprecedent I mean look at the Clinton presidency certainly he was impeached and there was enough there for the precedent for a president which the Congress would would look into but I think we have to look at the broader aspect of what's going on if you look at deep platforming you look at what's happened with Twitter and others where you have someone like for example Alex Jones who's deep platform but then you have someone who like Louis Farrakhan said much crazier stuff he's not the left is trying to diminish the First Amendment rights of those that they disagree with they're absolutely becoming everything they supposedly object to and we've seen it again and again and we've seen it in this particular outfit where you know this is a big concern in terms of the issue of being heard and and sexual assault and yet just look at current news look look at they've been on the wrong side of almost every one of those issues so in terms of burden of proof I don't think it's there I think there's a lot of doubt and I think I'm just looking at that objectively in terms of not being able to know how they got to that location this conclusion and now the left narrative is well you know you know this man's temperament apparently you're supposed to be okay with getting falsely accused of sexual assault so I think he reacted probably the normal way but in terms of burdens of proof it's just not there and in terms of Gorsuch who knows I think the left is looking at the the health of other members on the court and realizing oh if we get Cavanaugh confirmed what if the Republicans go ahead and get another justice if exactly for example exactly Ginsburg steps down exactly about power they're there Peter they're swinging for the fences for a reason because they're losing power you know Robert at one at one point in time I don't know it was in the last 36 hours the one of the leading hashtags was kill Cavanaugh but there was no you know there's no D platforming of that okay I mean this is what I'm getting at with the media they're they're magnifying this there they are the extension of the Democratic Party sometimes I think the media is actually running and running the Democratic Party but this is why I think I've always found it very curious because things get so totally magnet magnified and exaggerated here when the media when they start calling what they say our strikes and balls go ahead Robert well exactly instead of sort of post-traumatic syndrome you have sort of a post Trump derangement syndrome amongst large parts of the press amongst large parts of the democratic political establishment that is resorting to sort of oleanna style we go back to David Mamet who wrote a play about 20 years ago called Oh Liana in which he predicted and forecast that what was going to happen is not only was language going to be power but accusation was going to be power and that the mere ability to accuse it goes back to the old Roman principle that said if it's sufficient to accuse then what happens of the innocent and that's the problem here is that's becoming it's expanding within the culture that if you want power over someone in your employment arrangement if your in your educational structure and your political battle in any aspect of life then what you do is you simply accuse and if we create a standard that says it's okay to presume the accusation is true and then you have to were but it as is being written about in places like The New Yorker and all across the press in relationship to the Cavanagh syndrome then the whole case and really it should be called a syndrome rather than a case because it's creating a mindset and a precedent that is very precarious for people's basic civil liberties and for the presumption of innocence that should apply across our culture and society Brian what happens if Cavanaugh is ends up on the court I'm predicting that he'll actually he'll make it what is what are the Democrats going to do do you think that they will try to impeach a sitting Supreme Court judge once he sits at the court do you think they'll try an impeachment process Wow I mean if they were gonna do something like that they would have done that a long time ago when they did have the power to do so I do want to go back to this idea of derangement syndrome and that's what's being thrown at at Donald Trump and at his nominees I I always find it laughable you know the people who talk about Trump derangement syndrome these are the same people who to this day deny that Barack Obama was even born in America these are the same people who refused to even give a hearing to Merrick garland I mean Merrick garland wasn't even given the decency of getting this far in the process you tell me who's suffering from derangement syndrome but no Democrats we but Brian things like what Brian uuk wouldn't you agree wouldn't you agree that for eight years Barack Obama was given a complete free pass by the liberal media I mean he was just compelling okay I would no check ages news at c news CBS News any scandal in the Obama administration Benghazi for example was covered every night every night top to bottom so no I completely reject that Christopher what would you say to that I mean I tend to disagree I think that I mean the press I mean if you just look at the headlines the narratives the way things are covered the president Trump's credit here so here's a guy who's been attacked from every six every which angle leading up to the election rippy at war with Republicans with Democrats anyone because people are so distrustful of the establishment of media and the way things are covered in every single day it's a hit piece on him every single day it's negative media coverage and I think it's finally backfired whether it's CNN people crawling into puddles and pretending like the storm it's worse than it is it's just it's become so ridiculous it's real I know and so what so I just think might you tell me about it I live in Russia and I watch with CNN and MSNBC sense about it I mean it well good fiction and a bad fiction I would say go ahead just just Brian in jump in because you're the odd man out go Ahead's when you have a presidential candidate when you have somebody like Donald Trump calling Mexicans rapists when you have somebody like Donald Trump treated cheating on three wives having sexual bones many many many times she's talking about Trump excuse me I'll finish thank you Donald Trump has admitted he paid hush money to stormy Daniels if you're going to call Mexicans rapists and have sex with a porn star may is attorney paid might want to expect some negative headlines guys you might want let me go to Robert because Roberts a lawyer I mean hey all these things look I think even his supporters he Donald Trump is no choirboy they met they didn't vote for him because they thought he was a choirboy he's rude he's boisterous he's an egotistical maniac sometimes but none of these things are illegal and none of these have to do with anything with policy that's what I'm interested in is policy I personally would like to see a conservative judge in the Supreme Court because I like those policies but the Democrats don't talk about any of those things Robert yeah I mean I think they've got away from sort of policy principle debates and have become enamored and enmeshed in very much personality debates and often frankly that's good terrain for Trump I mean Trump's belief is that if he's dominating the news he's winning the news no matter what the nature of those news is so I think they've sort of got into the reality TV environment where they've lost a sense of perspective and in the process lost their sort of long-term institutional and intellectual edge that they could have with the American electorate in the process so they've gone from being people who wanted to be the highbrow professors to being the Jerry Springer's of politics and I don't think that's ultimately in their institutional interests that's fair and I think they should re-examine that that's very very Brian do you think that there's gonna be a backlash against this campaign against Kavanagh do you think that that might be a reason for people Republicans to go out and vote I don't think there's gonna be a backlash no I think the Democrats are going to retake the house there are polls out this week indicating that a majority of Americans right now don't feel very good about the Cavanaugh nomination I think it's gonna backfire with Democrats with the same people it would have backfired with them anyway I mean the fact of the matter is look it they are playing obstructionism yes I mean that's that's of course what they're doing they're trying to delay this nomination through the midterms that's politics you know when people ask why did it take so long for them to bring these allegations to the table well obviously yes they're waiting till the last minute try to screw the Republicans I I think it's only going to help their cause with their base and right now it looks like most independents are not exactly enamored with Brett Kavanaugh Christopher all I can say to that is that what about the polls in 2016 and the polls today why should we believe the polls now first of all we just have to think we just have to think we just have to think Brian for telling the truth right there what he just what Senate Democrats won't say which is that they waited to the last minute to try to to try to pull that I think yeah you know it's really interesting to see but did anyone else find it odd that the attorneys were working pro bono or that they were covering polygraphs I've been searching my whole life Peter for attorneys that work pro bono so thank goodness we've actually found attorneys that are just so honest and they're so great they work for free I need their number because last I checked I know lots of innocent people that have been working with attorneys and it it bankrupts the everyone everybody like I think but nobody don't trust the process but I think if you had Deborah Katz as your attorney she would make sure you were convicted of the most heinous crime even if you didn't do it alright gentlemen we run out of time any thanks to my guests and while she did Los Angeles and in Chattanooga and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember Rasta
