IT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED.

00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:46,636
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT

22
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:47,937
THAT YOU SPENT SEVEN MONTHS IN

00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,482
NEEDS FROM THE TEAM THAT'S IN

66
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:09,619

67
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,854

74
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,267
>> WHAT I THINK IS WRONG IS THAT

75
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:25,902
WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT ALL

76
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:26,236
12,000.

77
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:28,137
RIGHT NOW I THINK -- I REALLY

78
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,506
THINK THE LEFT IS ONLY PLAYING

79
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:30,340
THIS UP BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT

80
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:34,777
OTHER 10,000 THAT CAME BY

81
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:35,211
THEMSELVES?

82
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:37,347
HOW ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE RIPPED

83
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,581
OUT OF THEIR MOTHER'S ARMS IN

84
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,215
GUATEMALA OR HONDURAS OR

85
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:40,817
WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM AND THEN

86
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:43,186
STUFFED IN A TRUNK, SOME OF

87
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:45,522
THEM, TO CROSS THE DESERT BY

88
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:46,122
SMUGGLERS AND COYOTES.

89
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,991
I THINK IF WE WANT TO CARE ABOUT

90
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:48,725
CHILDREN WE HAVE TO CLOSE OUR

91
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:51,427
BORDERS ONCE AND FOR ALL SO THAT

92
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:52,395
THEY NEVER MAKE THAT JOURNEY IN

93
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:54,430
THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THAT

94
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:56,399
JOURNEY, WHICH IS SO DANGEROUS

95
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,936
AND OFTEN ENDS IN RAPE FOR BEING

96
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:00,904
SOLD IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR

97
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,805
OTHER THINGS, IF WE REALLY CARE

98
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:03,606
ABOUT THEM THEN WE HAVE TO CLOSE

99
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,708
OUR BORDERS ONCE AND FOR ALL SO

100
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:06,709
THEY NEVER MAKE THAT HORRIFIC

101
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,811
JOURNEY.

102

HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RUN AGAINST

108
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,220
HIM?

109
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:17,887
>> I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU

110
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,788
WOULD SAY THAT.

111
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:19,622
THEY HAVE A PRIMARY TONIGHT AND

112
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:20,623
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED WE STILL

113
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:24,961
DON'T KNOW WHO THE DEMOCRAT IS

114
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:27,430
GOING TO BE BUT WHOEVER IT IS

115
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,398
I'M GOING TO RUN EXACTLY THE WAY

116
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,832
I'VE ALWAYS RAN.

117
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,401
I WON FOR ELECTIONS FOR ONE

118
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:32,835
REASON, BECAUSE I WORKED MY TAIL

119
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:33,102
OFF.

120
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:37,774
THE ISSUES IN A MAKE SURE THEY

121
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:38,441
GET TO KNOW ME.

122
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:41,277
AND I THINK THAT HARD WORK IS

123
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:45,248
