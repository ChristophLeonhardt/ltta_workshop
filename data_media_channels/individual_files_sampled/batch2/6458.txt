for those of you who have watched he YT network's flagship show The Young Turks you're keenly aware of my cultural background I was born in Los Angeles to to Armenian immigrant parents being a child of immigrants has always given me a great deal of pride but specifically my Armenian culture has made me even prouder Armenians are fighters and survivors nothing made that more apparent than how they survived through the Turkish efforts to wipe them off the face of the earth in the early 1900's an estimated 1.5 million Armenians perished during the genocide simply because they were a Christian minority in the region men were slaughtered while women and children were forced on a death march through the desert to Syria I shared my own family story on The Young Turks in 2016 the purpose of a death march is to ensure that these people die now I want to share my personal experience with this story and why I think it's so important to share it with you as I mentioned my family was also victimized by this brutality my grandfather on my father's side my great-grandfather I should say on my father's side was murdered by the Turks and then my great-grandmother was forced to go through this death march with her children now luckily they survived because of the help of Turkish families that were against the genocide throughout my career some have asked how I can reconcile the fact that the CEO and founder of TYT Jane Cougar denied the genocide in a column he wrote for his college paper back in 1991 in the twenty seven-year-old Abed huger called into question whether the massacres that happen in 1915 can really be considered a genocide now reading that was disappointing and I knew I had one of two options I could either quit my job at the only news organization that allowed me to speak my mind without fear of censorship or I could stay and slowly chip away at the decades of propaganda he was exposed to I clearly chose the latter because I believed in jank I knew who he was as a person and I knew shunning people like him would do nothing to help the Armenian cause after several discussions he later rescinded his genocide denial column but guess what Peron that's not enough for the right-wing it's never been enough for the right-wing for them Yeager's past is the perfect way to attack an attempt to discredit him the attacks have been relentless and there's been an orchestrated effort to spread misinformation about where we both stand on the issue of the Armenian Genocide people have even accused me an Armenian whose ancestors were persecuted during the genocide of denying that it happened the latest defamatory attack came from a playboy opinion piece written by art sivanna he writes quote it's Casper Ian's role in joining the continuum of denial that pour salt onto the wounds of Armenians now he failed to show a single example of my so-called denial I've talked about the genocide multiple times on social media and more importantly on the young turks funny enough in the same column Tabata mentions a video I shot on April 24th 2015 which is the day Armenians commemorate the genocide they were raped they were basically left hungry if they slowed down the March anyway they were murdered immediately all the men were forced to go into labour camps and that was the reason why the genocide is referred to as the first genocide of the 20th century the video was shot from my personal YouTube channel because I happen to be travelling at the time not because I was being censored by TYT as you can tell by doing a simple search and seeing all the other videos I've done on this issue there's more from Teavana he writes quote Kasparian is first to ridicule conservatives for being immoral swine yes she sits next to you ger who's famous for his silence on the Armenian Genocide as we know silence is considered the final phase of genocide denial as it signals acceptance if you ger currently denies the Armenian Genocide he certainly has an incredibly strange way of showing it I'm glad that erawan is trying to fight for the roe hang of Muslims and we all should to make sure that they are not treated in this brutal way but the temerity of him to mention the word genocide when turkey doesn't recognize our meaning genocide we're an ethnic minority was targeted and driven out of the country that's an irony to ridiculous for for him to bring out so let's just be crystal clear no one at TYT denies the Armenian Genocide any accusation that either I or Jenk deny it is defamatory propaganda aside from Savannah's hit piece his written articles for LA Weekly that were so disrespectful to the female musical artists like sky Fiera that he writes about that his editor had to issue an apology for publishing it sivanna also issued an apology himself writing quote I have cultivated an intentionally provocative prose style that thrives on enacting a certain disregard for conventions and protocols of polite society to put it crassly that is my brand you know I've had run-ins with nationalistic Armenians in Los Angeles who are convinced that I'm a genocide denier so his style is a little problem problematic while filming an election special at California State University Northridge in 2016 a group of Armenian men interrupted our broadcast to protest the show they demanded an explanation of the show's name which I gladly answer to but it didn't matter what I had to say they threatened my parents who were in the audience and we later had to be escorted by police to our cars the protesters cleverly posted a small snippet of my emotional response after hearing them threatened my mother but of course they edit out what prompted my reaction in the first place finally I want to address the name of TYT networks flagship show The Young Turks the phrase young turk has been used by many to describe themselves or their organizations because in the Western world and in multiple dictionaries a young turk is one who rebels against societal expectations TYT was named back in 2002 when you gir founded the show because he wanted a news program that would challenge the horrible job mainstream media was doing in other words he wanted to rebel against the conventional way of delivering news but Teavana insultingly writes kasparian has now become Jencks best public relations strategy her TYT spin-doctor often begins with a classic propaganda tactic exploiting imprecise language and burying historical meaning while utilizing the phrase young turks as a metonym for young progressives per its definition in the current American Heritage Dictionary may be technically correct it is as intellectually criminal as describing Nazis as young socialists okay let's get one thing straight the word Nazi doesn't have multiple definitions Nazi means one thing and one thing only Young Turk on the other hand does not have one definition which might be the reason why Rod Stewart named one of his most popular songs Young Turks Tejada is supposed to be a music journalist if he had any knowledge about the very beat he's responsible for he'd maybe know that there's also a British music label dubbed The Young Turks there's a financial program not affiliated with us named The Young Turks CAA one of the largest talent agencies in the country has had a group of agents who have referred to themselves as Young Turks since the 1990s I guess all these people are horrible genocide denialists according to Savannah TYT is a platform that gives me the opportunity to educate others about any issue I find important including the Armenian Genocide upon reading sivanna's hit piece one TYT viewer wrote the following I wept like a babe during the tea the young turks Armenian Genocide anniversary video a couple years back ana kasparian did the entire video by herself specifically addressing the denials of it and recounted the plight of Armenian people fleeing the genocide one thing I can say is that I've been pressured into having a certain way or behaving a certain way all to appease Armenian men and it's all because of the last three letters in my last name I was supposed to condemn Jake quit a job I love and bow down to conservative Armenian men like to vana who really just hate the fact that I'm an outspoken progressive Armenian woman but I will never let clowns sivanna dictate my life or inform the decisions I make
