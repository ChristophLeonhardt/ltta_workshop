I'm here to defend free and high-quality
public education
inflation is exceeding 30% and we are
earning less than we need to feed
ourselves there are teachers who are
living in poverty
the government has done the exact
opposite they totally deregulated
markets sort of setting the grounds for
this run on the dollar
I think you have to give the government
time the legacy of the previous
government is very pronounced very
complicated
with a dollar worth over 40 pesos we
cannot buy teaching material supplies or
tools
