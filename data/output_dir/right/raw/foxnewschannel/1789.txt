1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:10,233
Ask your rheumatologist
about XELJANZ XR.

2
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:17,773
>>> THE FIRST LADY TOO ACCIDENT

3
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:21,344
STEP TO THE FORFRONT FOR AN

4
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:21,978
INITIATIVE.

5
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,247
>> I WOULD LIKE TOTH KATE OUR

6
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:26,315
CHILDREN ABOUT HARASSMENT AND

7
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,516
BALANCED LIFE.

8
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:28,985
>> THERE WAS SOME

9
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:30,286
STRAIGHTFORWARD COVERAGE.

10
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:32,455
SOME JOURNALIST PICKED UP ON A

11
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:33,823
WASHINGTON POST REPORT SAYING

12
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,858
THE FIRST LASTEDDY AND HUSBAND

13
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,760
LEAD SEPARATE LIVES.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,828
>> THE WASHINGTON POST AMONGST

15
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:42,665
MANY THINGS REPORTED THERE ARE

16
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:42,999
RUMORS.

17
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,834
MRS.  TRUMP DOESN'T LIVE-IN THE

18
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,936
WHITE HOUSE AND LIVES WITH HER

19
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:48,771
PARENTS SOMEWHERE IN THE

20
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:49,105
SUBURBS.

21
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:52,608
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE RUE

22
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:53,109
RUMORS?

23
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,311
>> I MAKE OF THE FACT THAT THE

24
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:57,313
WASHINGTON POST CAN'T GET THINGS

25
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:59,148
ANYMORE WRONG THEY DO.

26
00:00:59,148 --> 00:01:01,384
THAT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS CLAIM.

27
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:03,853
>> I SPOKE EARLIER WITH A

28
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:15,064
REPORTER FROM FOX NEWS 24/7

29
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:15,498
HEADLINES.

30
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:19,135
>> THE RUMOR IS REPORTED IN THE

31
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:21,470
57th PARAGRAPH FOLLOWED BY

32
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,606
OFFICIALS SAYING IT'S FALSE.

33
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:25,474
WOULD YOU HAVE PUBLISHED THE

34
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:26,075
RUMOR.

35
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,610
>> NO, I WOULDN'T HAVE.

36
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,012
TO THEIR CREDIT EVERY TIME THEY

37
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,848
DID HAVE A CLAIM FROM AN UNNAMED

38
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:35,284
SOURCE THEY DID BACK IT UP BY

39
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:37,553
TALKING TO THE FIRST LADY'S

40
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,789
SPOKE PERSON.

41
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:43,292
STILL, THAT WAS PUBLISHED AND IT

42
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,327
STICKS WITH PEOPLE.

43
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:46,729
THE FACT THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS

44
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,764
READING STAR MAGAZINE INSTEAD OF

45
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:49,932
THE WASHINGTON POST IS A

46
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:50,266
PROBLEM.

47
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,802
I THINK THIS ARTICLE REALLY

48
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:54,870
CROSSED THE LINE ON SEVERAL

49
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,371
OCCASIONS.

50
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:59,475
THE MOST GLARING WAS WHEN THEY

51
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:03,579
TALKED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT NEVER

52
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,548
PHOTOGRAPHED WITH HIS SON BARON.

53
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:07,416
IT FELT FORCED AT TIMES.

54
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,151
I BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE WILL READ

55
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,120
THIS ARTICLE AND TAKE IT WITH A

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,122
GRAIN OF SALT AND SAY PART OF IT

57
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:16,325
IS TRUE AND PART OF IT ISN'T.

58
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,294
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS

59
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:20,796
IS NOT A TABLOID THIS IS THE

60
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,431
WASHINGTON POST.

61
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:25,968
>> IT'S FAIR TO CRITICIZE AN

62
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:26,369
INITIATIVE.

63
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,604
EVEN TO SAY HER CYBERBULLYING

64
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:30,172
CAMPAIGN IS UNDERCUT BY HER

65
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:33,142
HUSBAND'S ATTACKS ON TWITTER.

66
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:36,012
DO YOU FIND SOME OF THIS IS

67
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,380
DISMISSING OR MOCKING.

68
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,616
>> I REALLY DO, IT ALL DOES

69
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:43,953
USUALLY FOCUS AROUND THEIR

70
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,087
MARRIAGE.

71
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:48,024
THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY ARE

72
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:48,557
INDEPENDENT PEOPLE.

73
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:49,625
SHE'S NOT THE KIND OF PERSON

74
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,394
THAT WILL GO UP AND HUG SOMEONE

75
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:53,429
IN PUBLIC.

76
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:53,996
>> UH-HUH.

77
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,564
>> WHEN SHE UNVEILED HER

78
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:58,467
INITIATIVE SHE WAS AFFECTIONATE

79
00:02:58,467 --> 00:02:59,769
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

80
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,604
MANY SAY THAT MOMENT WAS FORCED

81
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:03,472
AND STAGED.

82
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:04,874
THEY CAN'T WIN NO MATTER WHAT

83
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:05,574
THEY DO.

84
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:07,943
A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

85
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:10,713
STORMY DANIELS SITUATION AND

86
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:11,580
THAT'S REAL.

87
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,982
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THAT KIND OF

88
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:15,317
STUFF TO CERTAIN PUBLICATIONS

89
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,686
AND TWITTER NOT SERIOUS NEWS

90
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:18,154
SOURCES.

91
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:19,955
>> WE HAVE A HALF MINUTE.

92
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:24,560
SOME SAY SHE WAS RIPPING OFF A

93
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,429
BOOKLET FROM THE OBAMA

94
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:27,229
ADMINISTRATION.

95
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,598
HER SPOKESWOMAN HIT THE

96
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:31,734
OPPOSITION MEDIA PSIING IT'S ONE

97
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:32,101
DOCUMENT.

98
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:34,003
WE DIDN'T MAKE A SEC RIT THAT

99
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:37,573
THIS HAD BEEN OUT THERE BEFORE.

100
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:39,942
DOES THIS SUGGEST SHE CAN'T

101
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:41,210
CATCH A BREAK.

102
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,412
>> ALSO THE FACT THEY WERE

103
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:45,114
CRITICIZING THE NAME OF THE

104
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:45,681
INITIATIVE.

105
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:49,652
SAYING SHE MAY HAVE COPIED

106
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:52,221
MICHELLE OBAMA BECAUSE IN 2016

107
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:53,522
SHE SAID BE BETTER.

108
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:57,359
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY COULD

109
00:03:57,359 --> 00:00:00,000
STAKE CLAIM ON BE BETTER.
