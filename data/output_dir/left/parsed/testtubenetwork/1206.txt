Last week, an off-duty St. Louis police officer
shot and killed an 18 year old male.
This is in
the wake of the Michael Brown shooting that
happened two months ago, and it brings up
yet
another important question: Exactly what powers
do off-duty police officers actually have?
The rules vary between police departments,
and they’re actually more guidelines than
they are
rules.
But there is one hard and fast law covering
the rights of off-duty police officers.
The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of
2004 allows active and retired police officers
who
served for at least ten years, to legally
carry concealed weapons at all times, regardless
of
jurisdiction, or local and state laws.
But there are a few restrictions.
Officers can’t be in a Gun-
Free School Zone, they can’t be under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, and they can’t
be under
disciplinary action.
They also can’t carry a weapon if they were
forced to leave the department
due to mental instability.
That’s it.
That’s the only codified law specific for
off-duty Police Officers.
But there are a lot of
commonly accepted guidelines that most departments
follow.
Most of them allow their officers to
“moonlight” or take second jobs, even
allowing them to wear their uniforms while
doing security
work.
But there are limits.
Officers who want to work a second job do
so with permission from
their department.
And some departments don’t allow certain
types of jobs, like bartending or
stripping.
Most off-duty officers are allowed to make
an arrest or question a citizen, but in order
to do so
- they have to present proper identification
and follow all current police rules - which
of course
has its limits.
Off-duty officers cannot use their powers
to resolve personal grievances.
For
example, if the neighbor of an off-duty officer
is playing their music too loud, that officer
cannot
go next door and issue a noise citation.
This is according the International Association
of Chiefs
of Police.
Police are also advised against using their
powers to fight minor crimes, like parking
or traffic
violations.
They also shouldn’t pull anyone over while
in an unmarked vehicle, except in extreme
circumstances.
For example, some off-duty officers will stop
an obviously drunk driver.
On the whole though, most police departments
caution against officers doing police work
while
off-duty, mainly to protect the city from
liability lawsuits.
If an off-duty officer does something
illegal or unethical after identifying himself
as a member of the department, the city he
works for
could be held accountable.
Which is why many cities, like Philadelphia,
suggest that if an off-
duty officer sees a crime, they should simply
call 911.
