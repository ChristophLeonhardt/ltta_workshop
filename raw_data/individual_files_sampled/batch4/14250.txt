you know I think calling Tommy the last lion of Britain as I hook around your beautiful city of London I see many Lions I first I thought it was just the statues at Trafalgar Square or outside Buckingham Palace at Queen Victoria's memorial and I thought maybe Tommy is the last but as I look across the thousands of faces here that the media party will count only in the hundred thousands of faces here I know that there are lion cups being born and I would encourage you to speak up with courage and strength as my old British friend John O'Sullivan said it's easier to fight in the first ditch than in the last ditch and what I would say don't stand with Tommy Robinson today however hard it is however much slander and calumny is directed at you by your own media and even your government and even some police brass if you don't stand up now when it's hard I guarantee it will be harder later I must say that back in Canada where I'm from and in America where some of my fellow real reporters have come from today if we were to hear of a man who would have his fist hearing your first one he leaves on May 25th then the Court of Appeal hearing then the Court of Appeals ruling and then you're hearing here last month and today that's five and we know there will be a sixth I like Lea 7 if anyone back where I come from in the stalkers of the Empire in the Commonwealth would hear that in in the mother country where the Magna Carta came from where the rule of law was hammered out in America and Canada and Australia avi thank you for making the journey if we were to know that man would be on five court earrings and had served ten weeks in solitary confinement when it's against the law improvement to support teen days were born because of the psychological damage and if we would learn that this was all because of a facebook video that didn't disrupt the case if this were in any country other than the United Kingdom that we heard this if we heard that a citizen journalist was swept off the streets into a police station into a court into prison five hours and he wasn't even invited to say one word he wasn't even asked guilty or not he didn't say one word if we were to hear that coming from Iran or North Korea or Venezuela would we not say that is a political cancer so how is it that the United Kingdom the history of Liberty and law can treat its own son this way and maybe sometimes you need voices from outside the country to say what are you doing what are you doing and so let me close by inviting each one of you to try to be a lion in your own way not to bend the knee when the media party calls you means they will call you names no matter what try to show some courage has inspired by Tommy if even the 10 months in a dungeon for his free speech surely you can do something a fraction of that free wrong we don't take any money from the corporate media we don't take any money from the government that leaves just you my friends if you support our crowdfunded journalism please do at tommy trial calm you
