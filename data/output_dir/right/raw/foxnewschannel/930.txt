1
00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:10,285
REPORT WITH BRET BAIER.

2
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:10,986
>> Bret: THIS IS A FOX NEWS

3
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:12,954
ALERT, AND I'M BRET BAIER IN

4
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:13,355
WASHINGTON.

5
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:16,391
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SAYS THEN

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,959
FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY WAS

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,394
INSUBORDINATE DURING THAT

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:19,961
HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL

9
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:20,528
INVESTIGATION.

10
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:22,797
THE REPORT ALSO REVEALS A TEXT

11
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,299
MESSAGE IN WHICH ONE

12
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:26,601
INVESTIGATOR TELLS ON FBI LAWYER

13
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,670
THAT THEY WILL STOP DONALD TRUMP

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,237
FROM GETTING ELECTED.

15
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,006
BUT THE REPORT DOES NOT DIRECTLY

16
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:33,475
ATTRIBUTE POLITICAL MOTIVES TO

17
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:33,908
THOSE ACTIONS.

18
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,810
JUST MOMENTS AGO, THE CURRENT

19
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,578
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI PROMISED

20
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,748
THAT PEOPLE WILL BE HELD

21
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,382
ACCOUNTABLE, BUT INSISTED

22
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:41,383
NOTHING IN    IN THE REPORT IMPG

23
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:41,783
NOTHING IN    IN THE REPORT IMPS

24
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:45,153
THE INTEGRITY OF THE BUREAU AS A

25
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:46,021
WHOLE.

26
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,490
WE HAVE EXTENSIVE COVERAGE

27
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,293
TONIGHT INCLUDING REACTION FROM

28
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:52,761
TWO CHAIRMAN, TREY GOWDY AND BOB

29
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,030
GOODLATTE.

30
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,300
BUT LET'S BEGIN WITH CATHERINE

31
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:58,900
HERITAGE AT THE JUSTICE

32
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,735
DEPARTMENT TONIGHT.

33
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:01,436
LOTS TO DIGEST.

34
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,905
>> THE 500 PAGE REPORTS THAT IT

35
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:05,473
WAS 17 MONTHS IN THE MACON

36
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:06,641
ADDRESSES ALLEGATIONS OF

37
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:07,709
POLITICAL BIAS AND FOUND THAT

38
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,544
LORETTA LYNN SHOWED BAD JUST

39
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:12,814
DON'T MAKE A JUDGMENT AND FBI

40
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:13,581
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY WAS

41
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:14,149
INSUBORDINATE.

42
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:16,351
>> NO CHARGES ARE APPROPRIATE IN

43
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,152
THIS CASE.

44
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:19,187
>> WHEN FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY

45
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,222
GAVE HIS STATEMENT, THE

46
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:22,023
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND COMEY

47
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,159
WENT OUTSIDE THE CHAIN OF

48
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,560
COMMAND WHEN HE INTENTIONALLY

49
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,895
KEPT HIS BOSS, ATTORNEY GENERAL

50
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:29,030
LORETTA LYNCH AND HER DEPUTY,

51
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,932
SALLY GATES, IN THE DARK.

52
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,901
THEY FOUND IT WAS EXTRA NERI AND

53
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,136
INSUBORDINATE FOR HIM TO DO SO,

54
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,237
AND WE FOUND NO REASON FOR THE

55
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,940
DEPRESSED WEEKS OF BASIS FOR

56
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,108
DEVIATING FROM THE ESTABLISHED

57
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,276
POLICY.

58
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,611
IN A TWEET TO, COMEY RESPONDED.

59
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:45,580
I RESPECT THE DOJ IG OFFICE

60
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,382
WHICH IS WHY I URGE THEM TO DO

61
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:48,049
THE REVIEW.

62
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:48,950
THE CONCLUSIONS ARE REASONABLE

63
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,885
EVEN THOUGH I DISAGREE WITH HIM.

64
00:01:50,885 --> 00:01:53,254
PEOPLE WITH GOOD FAITH CAN SEE

65
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:56,024
AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION

66
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:56,458
DIFFERENTLY.

67
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:00,328
ON TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN PETER

68
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,696
STRZOK AND LISA PAGE, MICHAEL

69
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:05,100
HOROWITZ FOUND IN A DOCUMENT

70
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,700
DOCUMENTARY OR POLITICAL

71
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,804
EVIDENCE FOR BIAS.

72
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:12,507
IN A RECENT FOX INTERVIEW, COMEY

73
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,742
SAID POLITICS PAID NO ROLE.

74
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,243
>> I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN

75
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:17,912
THEM BUT I NEVER SAW ANY BIAS,

76
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:22,117
AND A REFLECTION OF ANY KIND OF

77
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:23,952
ANIMUS TOWARDS ANYBODY, EVEN ME.

78
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:27,522
>> A TEXT MESSAGE RECOVERED LAST

79
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,923
MONTH SUGGEST STRZOK MAY HAVE

80
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:31,326
ACTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS.

81
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:32,927
IN AUGUST OF 2016, PAGE ROAD,

82
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:35,930
TRUMP IS NOT EVER GOING TO

83
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,599
BECOME PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

84
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,968
RIGHT?

85
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,936
AND HE REPLIED, NO, HE WON'T.

86
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:42,570
WE WILL STOP IT.

87
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,373
THEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMAILS

88
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:49,043
WERE FOUND ON A COMPUTER.

89
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,714
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SAID

90
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,548
STRZOK DRAGGED HIS FEET AND NO

91
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,151
ACTION WAS TAKEN UNTIL TWO WEEKS

92
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,752
BEFORE THE ELECTION WHEN COMEY

93
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,320
REOPENED THE EMAIL CASE.

94
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,722
QUOTE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES,

95
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,892
WE DID NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT

96
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,959
STRZOK'S DECISION TO PRIORITIZE

97
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,528
THE INVESTIGATION OVER THE

98
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:09,764
LAPTOP WAS FREE FROM BIAS.

99
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:11,666
BUT STRZOK'S ATTORNEY'S DISPUTE

100
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,834
THAT SAYING THE DELAYS WERE

101
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,904
CAUSED BY MISCOMMUNICATION.

102
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,507
ON THE JUNE 2016 ARIZONA TARMAC

103
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,275
MEETING BETWEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL

104
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,911
LORETTA LYNCH AND BILL CLINTON,

105
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,545
THE REPORT CONCLUDED LYNCH

106
00:03:23,545 --> 00:03:25,613
SHOWED BAD JUDGMENT WHICH IS

107
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:28,316
TOOK THE MEETING AND FAILED TO

108
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,618
RECOGNIZE AND TAKE ACTION TO GET

109
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:31,619
THE VISIT SHORT WAS AN ERROR IN

110
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:32,520
JUDGMENT.

111
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,323
ON WHETHER THE CLINTON EMAILS

112
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:36,558
CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

113
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:37,559
WERE HACKED, THE

114
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:38,393
INSPECTOR GENERAL UNCOVERED ON

115
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:40,562
FBI REPORT WAS CONDUCTED AFTER

116
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,197
THE ELECTION.

117
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:43,765
THE CONCLUDED QUOTE CLASSIFIED

118
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,767
INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED BY

119
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,602
UNAUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS WHO

120
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,370
INCLUDED FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR

121
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,638
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BY CYBER

122
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,740
INTRUSION FROM ACCOUNTS LINKED

123
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,108
TO CLIENT AND SERVER.

124
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,010
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR WE HEARD

125
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,744
FROM FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER

126
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,880
WRAY WHO SAID HE ACCEPTS THE

127
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,347
FINDINGS OF THE

128
00:03:59,347 --> 00:03:59,914
INSPECTOR GENERAL AND

129
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:02,317
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MISTAKES WERE

130
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,886
MADE AND SAID THERE WOULD BE

131
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:05,520
CONSEQUENCES.

132
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,123
>> THE REPORT DOES IDENTIFY

133
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,192
ERRORS OF JUDGMENT, VIOLATIONS

134
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:13,361
OF OR EVEN DISREGARD FOR POLICY

135
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,996
AND DECISIONS THAT, AT THE VERY

136
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:18,700
LEAST, WITH THE BENEFIT OF

137
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,901
HINDSIGHT, WERE NOT THE BEST

138
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,735
CHOICES.

139
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,203
WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED TAKING

140
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:22,937
THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ADDRESS

141
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:25,373
THOSE ISSUES.

142
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:26,474
FIRST, WE ARE GOING TO HOLD

143
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:33,281
EMPLOYEES ACCOUNTABLE.

144
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,116
>> ALSO DIRECTOR RAY EMPHASIZED

145
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:37,352
THIS WAS A SINGLE INVESTIGATION

146
00:04:37,352 --> 00:00:00,000
AND A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES WERE
