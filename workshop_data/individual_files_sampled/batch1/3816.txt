so talk about some of the mistakes in the book delivering happiness you say look we made a lot of mistakes along the way what are those mistakes I would say probably the biggest category of mistakes is in hiring if you add up the cost of our bad hires and the bad decisions they made and then you know they in turn also hire more bad hires and this whole domino effect over the past 11 years it's probably cost the company well over a hundred million dollars and you know that would otherwise just be cash on our balance sheet and so how do you hire well the order that what are the best practices and we actually do two sets of interviews the hiring manager and his urging about interview for the standard stuff you know fit within the team relevant experience technical building and so on but then our HR department does a separate set of interviews purely for culture fit and they have to pass both in order to be hired so the difference is that we've actually passed on a lot of really smart talented people that we know can make an immediate impact on our top or bottom line but if they're not good for our culture which is more of a long-term play then we won't hire them or we're willing to sacrifice the short-term benefits for the long-term games and is that something you would have done in the past that lead to some of the states you're talking oh yeah my previous company link exchange we did that we've hired people that were had the right skills and experiences but weren't necessarily great for the company culture and that's how the company culture just went completely downhill and how do you figure that out and basically have the guts to say you know this would be a good candidate we've been looking for a long time but just culturally it's not the right person even though we need somebody immediately yeah I mean in every startup and every growing company you always feel like there's too much work to be done and it's very tempting to just put almost any warm body that's semi qualified and into a position that needs to be filled and that's part of the reason why we actually do the interview separately it's not one decision that's made by the hiring manager it's a separate decision made by the HR department so that kind of provides some checks and balances into there
