so most of you are internet people and have a twitter and you probably have noticed this whole NPC a meme and if you haven't noticed it let me just explain real quickly what this means so NPC came from the gaming community I'm not a big gamer so when I first heard it like a month ago I was like what are you talking about what's that and my friend had to explain to me that it's a gaming term called non-player character so if people like me that are a bit of a boomer don't really know this whole gaming world let's take this back to something we may understand so pac-man if we look at pac-man there are non player characters you the player is pac-man or pac-woman and the NPC's are the ghosts they are programmed with certain traits and characteristics they each color ghost moves and manipulates the game in a certain specific coded set of ways so the NPC is completely dependent on its programming and doesn't have a real person behind it and people that play video games can usually tell when there's a non-player character because they don't really have that essence of a real person they have programs that they go by and that's exactly how they function so this is a term that the internet started picking up and we started kind of using it just like the whole red pill blue pill thing which we would say the left half a regurgitate 'add certain set of responses that they have to everything whether it's you know calling us far-right or something like that so the internet thought was hilarious we took on these NPCs and made the left and diseased and the left are very confused by it they don't know what it was they I thought it was something totally different and then they were saying that it dehumanizes sjw's that's right they're claiming it dehumanizes them because they're robots the New York Times says what is NBC the pro-trump Internet's new favorite insult twitter has barred hundreds of right-wing accounts for posing a soulless non-playable liberal activists these accounts post as liberal activists and were used to spread among other things false information about November's midterm elections I actually have not seen any of that I don't know what they're talking about we usually use this MPC thing to make fun of late-night comedians or just any basic liberal response again it's a non-player character it's and of course Twitter can't have any of that of course the right can't have any fun making fun of sjw's Twitter responded by suspending about 1,500 accounts associated with the NPC trolling campaign the accounts of violator Twitter's rules against intentionally misleading election related content and the left just can't take jokes they can't see that this is a joke and they seriously think that it's a Russian thought which is such an NPC thing to say of course they would say it's a Russian bot red-state wrote about it a bit and they said it was brilliant to compare them to as JW's NPCs they have dialogue patterns and personality but at the end of the day they're just a program with preset behavioral patterns decided for them by a developer sjw serve a host of different functions depending on what activists politicians and the media need for them they're the crazy people trying to beat down the Supreme Court or the ante for members threatening motorists or the male feminists round housing a woman for expressing pro-life views sjw's may have dialogue patterns and personality but at the end of the day they're just a program with preset behavioural patterns decide for them by professors activist groups or the medium the comparison between npcs and sjw's is pretty striking and simultaneously hilarious the article goes on to talk about how sjw's aren't known for their individualism so the comparison NPC in SJW is pretty on point if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
