it's worth reading what can I do all right so Trump is going to Mexico and Hillary should be going to jail but instead is going to the White House close you know is jail White House what's the difference here's from the LA Times with the latest Hillary news the State Department says about 30 emails that may be related to the 2012 attack on the u.s. competence in Benghazi Libya are among the thousands of Hillary Clinton emails recovered during the FBI's recently closed investigation into her use of a private server this is a 30 new they're looking to see if they're duplicates but a district court a US District Court judge on Tuesday ordered these things released and they said get him out there faster the judge questioned why it would take so long to release so few documents and urge that the process be sped up he ordered the Department to report to him in a week the State Department to report to him in a week with more details about why the review process would take a full month it's because we're hiding them what do you mean it's like we can't find the hearing was held the hearing at the US District Court of Appeals was held as one of several lawsuits filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch who was operating on behalf of of course the New York Times and CBS NBC and ABC which haven't filed any FOIA demands for these presses so if if not for judicial watch these would never come out but let's just for a minute remember what Hillary told us in May about the emails after I left office the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work-related emails from our personal accounts I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related which told old roughly 55,000 printed pages even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them we went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department she left out the part about the bleach bed destroying all female here and also the acid the acid to destroy the smoking gun you know I love about Hillary Clinton it's like you know Hillary uses sulphuric acid to destroy smoking-gun and the New York Times headline is there's no smoking gun yeah that's what she said in May then last week on Hillary Kimmel a little different just a little bit different my emails are so boring yeah so we've already released I don't know 30 thousand plus so what's a few more you want and they're about Benghazi and what difference does that make right we already know that doesn't make make any difference all right but Hunton is still ahead Clinton's lead has shrunk in early August it was 7.6 percent this is from the hill and she did make it to 50 percent support that's obviously after the convention it's now shrunk to 4.3 points in the Real Clear Politics average and she's fallen short of the 50 percent mark in the last six national polls she holds a four point three point advantage nationally over Trump but she leads across the board in the battleground states that will decide the election Trump's path to the necessary 270 electoral votes is exceedingly narrow with a handful of swing states Colorado and Virginia among them already apparently out of reach so he's having a hard time but it doesn't matter because he's moved to Mexico oh maybe he hasn't moved to Mexico he just went to Mexico to meet with president Enrique Enrique Pena Nieto what these guys are gonna talk about I don't know it actually I have to say this actually seems like a smart move to me because what can happen I mean NATO can like kind of wag his finger in his face and lecture him which is a always a mistake with Trump because I'll just explode and blow you away or they can come you know looked at some comedy and friendliness and then Trump can come back and say oh alright you know we won't deport all the mothers and children from the cunt you know which he's gonna do he's making his speech tonight that he's delayed I think three times already he's put it off three times he's gonna make a speech tonight on his new immigration policy and you know I guess he comes back from Mexico and he says oh we talked it over and we you know this is the part of the deal and all this stuff so I don't know it seems to me like a smart move and and now he's gonna come out and say what everybody suspects he's going to say is that he's going to stop talking about this deportation force there's not gonna be any mother's ripped from the arms of their children then that everybody remember that before it was the bad guys leave immediately and then everybody has to leave and the good guys can come back legally and this was you know don't forget okay this was a big deal this is what made Donald Trump it wasn't just the wall I mean the wall was the big thing but this whole tough guy talk on immigration and if you were happening to be listening to the show there's just when we were getting started so there were only a few people listening but they would hear me saying this is never going to happen but he insisted this is that let's go back let's go back in the Wayback Machine and listen to Trump back in the day we're gonna get rid of the bad ones because we have some really bad ones in here right now and you know that gang members in LA you look at some of these gangs they're 100% illegal immigrants they're gonna be gone okay and they're gonna be gone fast and they're not gonna be in our prisons for us to take care of them our prisons are bursting with illegals right now whatever Stalone abide jority now the people that came in illegally yes and they're called illegal immigrants and they're here illegally they're gonna have to go and they're gonna have to come back in legally and otherwise we don't have a country and if we don't do that we don't have a country they're gonna have to go and they're gonna have to come in legally they're gonna have to come into a system you have right now Aaron millions of people that want to come into the country millions they're on a waiting list they've gone through documentation they've gone through all sorts of things and they're waiting on a list in some cases for years yes and it's very unfair to them it's very unfair now you can do the work visa thing in terms of the grapes because I have people friends with the grapes and they may need people we can do lots of different things but accurate but to come here and stay here you have to come in to the country legally we either have a country or we don't okay and the big deal about this remember was that everybody else was weak so we don't know what he's gonna say tonight he may just stick to his guns we're gonna deport everybody they're gonna all get on buses twelve million people and that by the way is a low estimate right that's the anti Ann Coulter estimate Ann believes that I think 250 million of the 300 million Americans are illegal immigrants was like the entire country to leave except for white people who came over on the Mayflower but a little unfair but just that just a little joke and just so-so but the important thing about this was that everybody else was weak remember Marco Rubio was the gang of eight and he wanted amnesty and John Kasich was weak and all this stuff and here was Kasich back in the day this is after the debate in late February Kasich comes on and he reacted to what Trump was saying and what I want to do is finish the border make sure we can protect the border but then we can have a guest worker program and for the 11 and a half million people who came here illegally if they have not broken the law since they've been here I would give them a path to legalization and not the citizenship they'd have to pay back taxes and that's practical Eric I mean you know what I'm going to be deporting going and yanking people out of their homes that's just the fantasy so I think what I'm proposing is something that actually could pass the Congress of the United States and actually bring Republicans and Democrats together to get that finally done well so so Donald Trump and Ted Cruz say send at 11 or 12 million back first let them come back in get in the back of line you disagree with those how they gonna get them they're not gonna just leave are you kidding me you look what are you gonna do drive in the neighborhoods and start yanking people out of their homes leaving their kids on the front porch screaming I mean that's not who we are and that's not gonna happen that'll never it'll never happen they'll never pass it it's just not gonna be what we're gonna do okay the point about this the reason I'm playing this is because remember this was weak weird funny shouldered John Kasich we're all laughing at him you know Donald Trump is the strong man some of us some of us just too right you know I don't you say I told you so but some of us kept saying you know you can sound like a strong man and not be a strong man and you can sound quiet speak quietly and actually be the stronger guy you know that's just that is just a truth of life it's the truth unfortunately that many women forget and many men forget and follow that noise that thing that sounds like strength that things that sounds like masculinity but isn't so now we're the important thing the Kasich said there is that it's a fantasy okay it's a thing that takes place in people's mind we're gonna deport all these people these millions of people people are gonna watch on TV these these women screaming and the baby screaming you know they're gonna look at that and they're all gonna say yeah just yeah let's go and do that because the same people who were calling for that are gonna see it on TV and start to say how do we let this happen okay so now now it's it sounds like Trump is softening he said himself there may be softening will there be a deportation force it's to be determined so a guy calls in rush and says to Rush Limbaugh you know you sold us this thing as if it were serious and here's part of this exchange between this caller and Rush God with all due respect brush on Chuck Todd show he specifically said when asked the question you mean you're gonna rip the families apart he said no I'm not gonna rip the families apart they all have to go even the US citizen children he then got in the middle of the debate and the argument between Marco and Ted when Ted wanted legalization and Marco wanted citizenship as part of a comprehensive plan that he said they're both wrong and they're both being absurd they all have to go or we don't have a nation of laws come on even watching the debates as well as the rest of us were you know exactly what he said Nieto exactly the way he ridiculed everybody on that stage yeah well I guess I guess the difference is or not the difference I guess the thing is this is gonna win rage you you know I can I can choose a path here to try to modify you but I never took you seriously on this but 30 million 30 15 or 10 million to the 10 million people did yeah and they still don't care that my point they still don't care they're gonna stick whatever no matter what I mean that guy have a say we're gonna have to say goodbye to you on Facebook come over the Daily wire and hear the rest it just gets more interesting with the mailbag you
