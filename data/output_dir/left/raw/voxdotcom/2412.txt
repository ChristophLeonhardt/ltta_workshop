1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:06,480
<<Phone ringing>> "Hello?" I'm, uh, planning a wedding
for next spring."  "a quick quote for

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,980
a venue for a family gathering"

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,670
"between 120 and 130 guests." "for 125 people"

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,830
"we're aiming for April 16th"  "the 16th"

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,630
"That's going to be a $15,000 food and beverage minimum" "The food and beverage minimum is $17,000."

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,750
This 2000 dollar
difference is what's known as the

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,630
"wedding mark-up"

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,710
where some venders charge a higher price
for weddings than for other similar parties

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,730
so why are weddings so expensive?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,640
The wedding website "The Knot"surveyed thousands of its members and found that the average

11
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:46,229
cost of their weddings was thirty-one thousand dollars last year that's not including honeymoon

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,969
wedding dresses average at thirteen
hundred dollars and

13
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,969
catering comes in its $68 dollars per
person. And those numbers are a lot

14
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,420
higher if you live in places like New York
Chicago DC or San Francisco

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,620
the wedding industry is kinda weird and
it's an industry that I have quite a bit

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,660
of experience in

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,420
my way Isabel and I run a wedding
videography business in Washington DC

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,960
and here's my take on my way to so
expensive

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,520
There's this economic concept called

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,630
asymmetric information. With most things you buy you have a pretty good gauge in

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,340
what you're getting for what you pay for.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,590
you pretty sure that an 8 dollar avocado
is way too much

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,220
because you've bought avocados before.
Familiarity with a market

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,380
produces balanced information between
buyers and sellers and so they can settle on a fair price

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,640
This is like economics 101.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,840
but most people shopping for wedding
stuff and very little

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,070
if any experience with what they're
buying.

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,700
cake, dress, napkins, catering, venues, flowers.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,430
This is something you just don't buy
very often so you have a very good gauge

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,530
on what should be paying.

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,130
This is made a lot harder by the fact
that we wedding vendors

32
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,570
have a hard time posting our prices. You usually have to reach out and inquire

33
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,950
to get any sort of pricing information.

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,240
Imagine if you had asked for pricing for
every item

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,440
in the grocery store. Shopping would be a
lot harder. When I first was starting my business

36
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,830
I read on a blogs about marketing to
prospective clients.

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,090
And overwhelming message that I kept
reading is

38
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,110
"steer away from talking about price"

39
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,280
Blogger: "we've put together a free report that shows you how to answer

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,430
"price question" with those email  leads
in a way that steers them away from price quickly

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,709
so you can get them on the phone or to a
meeting where you can book them!"

42
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,510
And then there's Pinterest. Planning: "Pinterest can
be really useful I think

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,910
using it as a starting point" It's an
amazing tool for wedding inspiration

44
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,640
or if you have an experience wedding
planner by your side, but usually doesn't

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,090
help with the price question.

46
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,130
"...and you see all these like amazing dresses and you can click on it to like get more information.

47
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,480
you're going to get a lot more pictures , but you're not gonna find

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,850
any pricing information. And of course
there's always

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,070
the option to "repin" it if you'd liked. If you 
are like a normal person

50
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,290
with a budget like you're setting
yourself up to be

51
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,120
let down. Another thing that makes
wedding so expensive is

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,440
the once in a lifetime mentality.

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,700
The classic line for brides shopping for
a wedding dress

54
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,710
is: Designer:  "It's the dress of your life ,

55
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,610
and if there's ever one picture will have of you,

56
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,420
it's the one in your wedding dress wedding dress."

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,860
That's wedding dress designer and artist
talking on Planet Money. I'm as guilty as

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,850
anyone at this:

59
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,980
Here's were very first ads. it's all
about that once in a lifetime feel.

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,950
It's just really hard not to splurge
when you put so much weight into one day.

61
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,670
So, it's easy to look at this and think
there's no doubt that wedding vendors

62
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,320
are ripping off their clients.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,590
But there's another side to the story
that i think is important to mention.

64
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,000
Planner: "Corporate flowers for example all
there's probably going to be

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,130
direction but maybe there's a little bit
more flexibility where as a bride had

66
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,380
dreamt up a certain flowers and she in

67
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,770
want to talk to the florist multiple times
about the bouquet and the ribbon

68
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,890
treatment and the fact that her
grandmother's broaches gonna be on that Bouquet.

69
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,880
It's a lot of time and energy spent
on those flowers and that's gonna be

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,060
reflected in the price."

71
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,240
The upshot of this is that the emotional
weight of weddings usually means more

72
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,460
work for vendors,

73
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,860
and thus higher prices. And the most
demanding clients

74
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,329
are the ones that set the prices for
everyone. So the best thing you can do to

75
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,609
avoid being swindled

76
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,810
is to demand the price range before
hearing a sales pitch.

77
00:04:22,810 --> 00:00:00,000
we vendors might hate it but it's the
fair thing to do.
