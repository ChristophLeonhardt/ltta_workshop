for those who thought media bias against Donald Trump would stop after his election to the presidency Trump's interview with 60 minutes conclusively demonstrated just how wrong that idea was CBS News is Lesley Stahl desperately attempted to blame Trump for violence breaking out across the country against Trump here was what Lesley Stahl had to say she said quote it has been five full days since the election and anti Trump demonstrations driven in part by Hillary Clinton's edge in the popular vote have been significant when we interviewed him on Friday afternoon mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are propping up in his name or against his supporters nor had nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans Latinos engaged by some of his supporters now Trump you see is ignorant and it's all his fault meanwhile we in the real world are all watching mass protests and rioting on our TV against Trump yet stall work to make Trump the problem not the solution here's how their exchange went Trump said I am very surprised to hear that I hate to hear that I mean I hate to hear that and Lesley Stahl said but do you do hear it and Trump said I don't hear it I saw I saw one or two instances Lesley Stahl on social media Trump but I think it's a very very small amount again I think it's Lesley Stahl do you want to say anything to those people Trump I wouldn't say to him to it that would say don't do it that's terrible because I'm gonna bring this country together Lesley Stahl they're harassing Latinos and Muslims from I am so saddened to hear that and I say stop it if it helps I will say this and I would say right to the cameras stop it okay so we don't have stalls original question to Trump but from the content of the exchange it seems like she focused almost exclusively on supposed violence by Trump supporters most of which appears to be unfounded this is asinine and it's also disingenuous Stahl seems quite concerned about violence surrounding from selection but CBS News held the tape of Trump condemning violence and telling people to cut it out for three days if they truly cared about tamping down violence why not release that tape right away they released a bunch of other clips from the interview well that's cuz the media don't care about the violence they just care about blaming Trump for the violence it's why the media never put pressure on Obama to condemn riots in cities across the United States even as Obama and his Department of Justice justified them it's why the media never cared about asking Hillary Clinton about violence against Trump supporters during this campaign violence only matters if it can be blamed on those the left-wing media hates otherwise it's a tool for change just ask media darling DeRay McKesson who was feeded at the White House or the members of Occupy Wall Street but if any Republican goes to a tea party rally they're obviously the problem don't expect the media to change but if they don't want to destroy their own credibility permanently they better start treating more honestly with the American people I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay so much to get to everybody's getting ready to launch the new Trump White House we'll get to the staffing decisions at the Trump White House in all of their glory and shame in just a moment but first we have to say hello to our friends over at ring.com so if you are concerned about home burglary or the possibility thereof the thing

money on their products because I think their product is so stellar it's ring.com slash been again one hundred and fifty bucks off your ring of security kit and stops burglaries and and allows you to know who's at your front door which is always something that is worthwhile particularly for me since I have heard that Steve Bannon is coming in any case we can jump right into let's jump right into the news okay so at the beginning let's just say it is fun to watch the left meltdown it is really a lot of fun to watch the left lose their minds and what makes it fun for me is the knowledge that the left would lose their minds the exact same way if Ted Cruz had one or Marco Rubio or one or hell if John Kasich and one they would still lose their minds and go crazy so there's a lot of talk about Trump being out of the box I agree there's a lot of talk about Trump being uniquely bad in some ways I agree but that's not why the left is protesting the left is protesting because they don't like the idea that conservatives even showed up to vote they don't like the idea that somebody who's not a Democrat at least a name actually is the President of the United States and so they're going nuts so here is a little bit of footage from some of these protests this was the scene in downtown Los Angeles for the third straight Knight angry Angelenos taking over the streets and protest of president-elect Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's election more than 180 people were arrested in what became a dangerous situation for some officers we didn't have an officer who was injured when trying to take someone into custody that officer was transported to a local hospital and at this time he's in stable condition and he's expected to be released later today LAPD saying those they arrested had interfered with traffic and vandalized public property including buildings and patrol vehicles the group growing to several hundred in size we want our voices to be heard and we will not stand down there were even some reports of people throwing rocks and bottles at officers and demonstrators who according to police just wouldn't go home these idiots take over the streets in LA to which from says I drink your cell tea bitter tears they're delicious like Donald Trump is going to resign the presidency because a couple of whiny college students from LA decided to take over a street in a city that Trump lost every vote in like all these riots all these protests are taking place in areas where Trump lost right it's not like there's any impact on Trump it's not like there's any impact on on the administration I'm not even sure what they're protesting at this point like there's lots of stuff that Trump is going to do that's probably worthy of Rhodes house we hadn't done it yet he hasn't done it yeah like maybe later tonight I'll lead a protest against Steve ban and becoming the White House chief counsel whatever is but like he hasn't done anything yet this is all this is all silly talk so that all these all these whining crybabies who are very very upset and they're walking around so mopey and oh my god the world this is over because someone they don't like was elected president he hasn't done anything yet he's not even the president yet he's just some guy who's getting ready to be President once he's president then I think that it is fair if you disapprove a policy that he's pushing you go out and you can you can protest all the never riot don't take over streets because this makes you a douche but if you're gonna do this on the basis of I lost an election well maybe more of you young people should have showed up and actually voted in that election and then maybe you wouldn't lost I mean Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but you lost in a lot of these swing states because young people stayed home smoke and weed so young people didn't show up for her minorities in show up for her who are the people who are actually riding and protesting largely young people and minorities so the whole thing is just ridiculous naturally cory booker who thinks he's gonna run for president in 2020 against trump he's trying to to make inroads with these protesters hoping to jazz them up get some enthusiasm going i'm sitting here right now having this conversation with you because of the tradition of american protest i have my rights not because of washington suddenly deciding Strom Thurmond and others hey let's give a certain Americans equal rights but because of the ardent unyielding voice of protesters and so when you have a president that is in his campaign who ran saying things that not aren't is contrary to a fact but literally threatening to use presidential power in a way that would erode the rights and privileges inequality of large sections of Americans god bless the protesters but I will tell you this I question anyone who in their protest becomes the very thing that they're protesting against I think turning to hateful sin and he says they keep saying loves or love Trump's hate and then they go and burn crap and he's saying that's probably a bad idea yeah probably okay so here okay so before we go any further I think that it's important to get past the elephant in the room because I know there are a lot of people watching specifically because of the news that Steve ban and the former Breitbart CEO is now going to be the the Trump White House chief he's not the chief of staff he's the chief strategist is what they're calling him which means that he's basically Valerie Jarrett or Karl Rove it means he has a very heavy portion in the in the policy-making and the direction of the of the administration so I've written columns about what I think of Steve I legitimately think that Steve Bannon is one of the worst people of America but that doesn't mean that this is the worst thing that's ever happened to the country that he's the that he's the White House she's strategist I'll explain what's what's good about this and what's bad about this and what he's actually going to do and a lot of it is still up in the air now I will say the left are going too far in this so they're immediately saying that he is that he is anti-semitic they're saying that Steve is white supremacists you have all these people who are who are saying that Steve is white nationalist okay so there's Steve's personal views and then there's who Steve associates with Steve's Ben who he's willing to humor I have no evidence on a personal level and I work with Steve for years I have no evidence on a personal level that Steve's a racist or an anti-semite okay I've never heard those views come from him I've never felt anti-semitism from Steve okay and that said so the left is going too far when they say like there's a big headline at Huffington Post white nationalist runs white house okay that's that's too much it's not it's not true that said there are some problems here there are some problems here and here are the problems so I have a few thoughts on unbanning as the White House chief strategist beyond the fact that I think the benin is a brutal vindictive piece of crap beyond that I think that when it comes to Bannon the number one question I've gotten texts and questions all days Yantis American racist as I said I have no personal knowledge of him personally being anti-semitic and racist that said he obviously has patterns the anti-semitic racist alt-right the all tripe is a group of people all right is a group of people first of all let me just say something about the alt-right not everyone who says they're all right is actually all right there are a lot of people who don't know what it means they don't know the founding philosophy and ideology of the alt-right they just think all right means that you like to put up peppy memes or I like to tweet about harambe or whatever other stupid thing you're doing online and you don't like Paul Ryan and therefore you're all right that's not what alt-right means all right is a philosophy that is that is expositor by people ranging from Vox State or Richard Spencer and that philosophy is that Western culture is inseparable from European ethnicity okay it is white nationalism all right is white nationalism that's what the that's what the the root of the philosophy is that doesn't mean that everybody identifying is all right believes that cuz some of them are doing it wrong but it does mean that that is the root of the philosophy and Bannen knows that he's not a stupid man and he has pander to those people he had Milo yeah innopolis who's an alt right popularizer write a long piece for Breitbart about how the alt-right was the kind of new legit new right in the United States and the actual white supremacists do love Benin and they think the Bandon been abandoned bragged openly about turning Breitbart into an alt right fansite essentially Richard Spencer who's an actual white supremacist he said bright bart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced Breitbart in this way Breitbart has acted as a gateway to all trite ideas and writers I don't think it has done this liberally again it's a matter of elective Infinity's affinities and I think that's exactly right I think that Spencer is correct and Peter Brimelow another one he said the ban and being appointed to the Trump campaign was great news okay so what does that mean what does that mean that Bannon has elective affinities with the alt-right that he's warm toward a bunch of white supremacists and anti-semites and and he is warm toward the philosophy of the intellectualized all right what does that mean well it depends on what you think Ben is actually gonna be doing at the White House so what does he want well Bannon always wants power well now he finally has he spent a decade accruing power he kept kind of leaping from politician to politician riding their coattails he did to Michele Bachmann he made a documentary about her and then he hoped to kind of glom on to her success he did the same thing with Sarah Palin he did the same thing with Andrew Breitbart before he died then took over his business and now he's done the same thing with Trump and he just picked two winners in a row Breitbart and Trump and so he ends up in one of the most powerful positions in American government so what will he do well first of all he will actually target enemies Bannon is a deeply deeply vindictive guy he's somebody who likes to destroy enemies it's something he takes pleasure in he likes to think of himself that way so he wouldn't be a surprise for me to say this even to him and and so when I jokingly said earlier this year that if Trump wins I expect my IRS audit that was not really a joke I mean I think that if it with Bandhan in the White House I think a lot of people who did not support Trump sufficiently and didn't support Bannon and think bannon's a bad guy those people will will be targeted by Bannon or at least there's a good shot they will be but more importantly beyond sort of personal vendettas bannon's actual agenda is he does not like the Republican Party which is okay except that he doesn't like them for the wrong reasons Bannon is a is a European far-right populist that's what Bannon is he's somebody who believes first and foremost in the idea that we have to have tariffs and we have to assure the continuation of Western civilization by limiting immigration not just immigration on the basis of philosophy just immigration generally has to be limited he doesn't believe in small government per se that's not an important thing to him he's he's sort of in line with marine lepen the French National Party leader she calls for harsher penalties for criminals and significant restrictions on Muslim immigration and protectionism on trade and a restoration of the franck is the national currency rather than the euro and a big government in terms of health care that's pretty much Trump's platform and Bandhan is all in favor of that the European right is not the American right the American right traditionally the conservative American right traditionally has said constitutional principles like individual liberty and personal responsibility and limited government these are the core Americanism and if you can accept those principles you can come from anywhere and be part of America that's not what the the nationalist right believes nationalist right believes close the borders now we have to stand up for our culture against all other cultures and people can't really integrate into the culture in there there can't be any integration there can't be any openness how we really have to close ourselves off it's very close to sort of Pat Buchanan's idea of the universe and it's no shock that The Daily Beast reported the banner has already reached out to marine lepen in France as well as Nigel Farage of the UK independent party so the question is what will Bannon actually do so at the same time they announced that Bannon was going to be the new White House chief strategist they announced that Reince Priebus was going to be the Reince Priebus was going to be the White House chief of staff so there are few ways to read that there's the optimistic way to read that and then there's the pessimistic way to read that and I'll let you choose and by the way I'm trying to be as objective as I possibly can be given the fact that I have personal distaste for a man that I believe is a destructive force inside the Republican Party and in the conservative movement generally and who's out for his own self-aggrandizement here's here's the breakdown if you're optimistic Bannon leads the war on the media right he just fights the left media on behalf of Donald Trump because that's sort of what he did at Breitbart and Ryan's handles all of the internal party squabbles and just helps Trump work with Ryan because Ryan's is very very close with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan that's the most optimistic version that's sort of what Ed Morris he thinks is happening here I don't think that's what's happening here there are other people who say the Bandon was just added as a sock to the populist base really Reince Priebus is going to be doing the heavy lifting I don't think that's right either and the reason I don't think that's right either is because it seems to me that Ryan's is the week is the weak leg of the stool Bannon is an alpha Reince is Abeyta Brian's is the bagman and Bannon is whispering and Trump's ear this morning Reince came out and he was praising Trump raising Bannon and and here is what he had to say about Bannon a lot of people concerned because they look at the website he ran Breitbart news as one paper put it it recently accused President Obama of quote importing more hating Muslims called Bill Kristol a renegade Jew advised female victims of online harassment to just log off and stop screwing up the internet for men I I guess people are wondering is this the worldview that Steve Bannon will bring to the White House can you let them know anything about him that would be contrary to the website he ran sure and and and that wasn't his writing I mean that was that was some articles and bright but I wasn't him I know oh yeah the the guy I know is a guy that isn't any of those things I mean the guy knows a guy sit in an office all day yesterday talking about hiring talking about people and in the last few months as they got exhibit none of those qualities here's a guy who's Harvard Business School he was a ten year naval officer London School of Economics I believe he is he is a guy who is pretty he's very very smart very temperate and together we've been able to manage to put it bluntly this is a load of horse bleep okay this is what he's saying right now is not true okay Bannon went at Breitbart all the buck to absolutely stopped at Bannon no major piece went up on the website with bit without bannon's go ahead and and that's been true for a long time and people been saying that for a long time it's true okay so the idea that Bannon had nothing to do with you know that the transitions were Trump's tourism and the alt-right is absolutely untrue when he says that Bannon is temperate that's just insane okay like I don't know a single person who knows ban and who would describe ban in his temperate Benin can be temperate he can be charming with people who he thinks he's he's conning basically and writes since he spent this entire election cycle massaging Trump's buttocks and the people of those around him it's not a surprise that Bannon was temperate with him why wouldn't he be but but Bryan's has to know he's lying I mean I can't imagine that Ryan's has gone this entire election cycle with how abandon screaming at him at least blonds that's not the temperate is not the word it's just it's just absurd all the way through and this is the problem right so the left is right is wrong about Bannon but the idea that man is not going to have any any say in this White House is really not true and when it comes to how that breaks down the problem is of course that if Bannon wants to go to war with Ryan like literally an hour after they announced the Bannon would be working with Ryan's at the at the White House Breitbart ran a story about how Ryan should be ousted as Speaker of the House so if you think that the ban is just gonna sit by while all the policy gets done yeah that's that's not happening and Kellyanne Conway who really has turned out to be I thought this during the campaign but she is she's a very very skilled liar she talked up Bandhan as well on Meet the Press it's a very small core senior team probably less than 10 people all told and and I'm sure that everyone will be very important to the president moving forward I will say this though I think what having worked with him and known him but Steve Bannon in this particular campaign was the general and he is much more the Goldman Sachs managing partner and much more the naval officer I think than people realize then people realize that's what you're saying is he's not we wouldn't come in to say let's burn Washington down / verbally I think that the president-elect is there to actually implement his first 100-day plan and those around him know that and will appreciate that whether it's within his inner circle on Capitol Hill I we are very grateful in Trump world to both Bannon and previs and I think you'll see them work continue to work together we all worked very closely it's very okay so look people are not gonna be in the mood to hear bad stuff about Trump right now which is why I'm trying to be honest about what I think this means I'll wait to see how it shakes out but the idea that's being promulgated that Steve is some sort of temperate moderate moderating force in the in the White House that just is not true it's just not true and if you want lies then I suggest that you listen to some other show or watch some other show but I'm not gonna lie to you just because Trump won so I'll tell we're gonna do some serious good Trump at Trump in a minute because Trump it's not all bad I think the Rhines pick is a good pick I I think that that this pick is a bad pick but will gets
