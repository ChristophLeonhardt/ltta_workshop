president obama bragged in october 2011 he had succeeded in fulfilling a crucial campaign promise he said quote as a candidate for president I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end Iraqis have taken full responsibility for their country's security he then added after nearly nine years America's war in Iraq will be over of course as soon as America pulled out Isis and Iran pulled in today the military requested that five hundred more troops be sent to Iraq to prepare a new invasion of Mosul according to The Wall Street Journal the new US forces would increase the number of American personnel officially deployed in Iraq from forty four hundred to about forty nine hundred we also have 1,500 additional US forces that the Pentagon doesn't acknowledge as part of the Iraq force we actually have 6,400 people in Iraq in July 2011 it's worth remembering the LA Times reported the White House was considering keeping 10,000 troops in Iraq after the end of the war in order to prevent terrorist uprisings the White House obviously and projecting that plan and Isis used the vacuum in order to overrun Iraq's borders if Obama had implemented that plan as the Wall Street Journal's Brett Stevens pointed out today the US would likely have about like 6,400 troops in Iraq today and no Isis and by the way those Isis troops it was reported are now using mustard gas that's weapons of mass destruction against American troops but that's been Obama's presidency in a nutshell you promise something undoable you try to do it you fail and then you watch as circumstances force you to embrace the plan you rejected well you still pay for the consequences of your failure that's what happened in Syria where Obama once wanted Assad gone then back down from his redline then had to embrace the lettuce I'd kill them position all the while accepting tens of thousands of Syrian refugees it happened in Iran to where Obama wanted to make Iran part of the global community and people said this is gonna fail and then he signed a deal to legitimize them and now he's gonna escape office just in time to avoid watching the Iranians thwart the deal utterly under his watch it happened domestically also Obama promised universal health care and then he delivered the Obama care failure and now he has to beg States to expand Medicaid fulfill his promises Obama's policies have been a giant massive undeniable failure the policies have cost lives they've destroyed full countries now he's trying to put the genie back in the bottle and it's worth pointing out that if he hadn't been such a stubborn leftist fool the world would have been a far more full place in the first place I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so first of all just want to say hello to our sponsors

over the mailbag today so if you're a subscriber who for you you got to be part of the mailbag we'll be doing that later in the show but we begin today with new information surrounding Keith Scott this is the guy who was shot in in Charlotte North Carolina and that has prompted out-and-out riots in Charlotte North Carolina so what his family said is that he was said we discussed this yesterday he was sitting in his car supposedly waiting for his kid to get back from school via the school bus and he was sitting and he was reading a book right he was reading a book because he was just that that's the kind of guy he was she sat through here at Aristotle in his spare time in the middle of downtown Charlotte and they said he didn't have a gun they said that there was no gun present none no gun the police said guys there wasn't gun there's a limit of a gun and not only was there a gun we told him put down the gun he did not put down the gun and so we shot him and he was raising the gun and he was in imminent threat okay here is a picture and police have confirmed that this is indeed a picture of his body and you will notice an object that is lying near his body does that look like a book to you now I understand the President Obama thinks that it's easier to get a gun than a book but in this particular picture was easier to have a gun than a book apparently there is a gun next to his body because he did in fact have a gun and the family you know they lied about it they said that there was no gun present that he was completely unarmed and he was just an innocent guy shot by the evil white police force the officer who shot him was black facts don't matter at all in these situations anymore and when the tape comes out they still won't matter because you can have tape that completely exonerates officers and people still come up with a twisted way of interpreting the tape so that it's the officers fault that somebody gets shot so naturally because facts have no relation to the case because people like Hillary Clinton pretend that this that this fellow this Keith Scott guy was completely innocent didn't do anything wrong there are riots and the riots are horrible I mean we have tons of video from the right so here's here's video from what the riots look like at the hospital and then there's another tape that showed a white guy just getting the the absolute crap beat out of him they he was unlucky enough to be in a parking lot and a bunch of black kids and of their kids I mean black teenagers young adults I start beating more than crap out of him just cuz he's white and he's there do we have the video okay this is stuff from a clockwork orange' honestly I mean this is this is somebody's innocent walking in a parking lot a bunch of people confronts him they rip off his pants they're they're yelling at him they're beating him they're kicking him somebody runs up and kicks him in the head he's begging for help no helpless forthcoming but don't worry these are just honest protesters they're just protesters that's the way this goes it's all right you know we're used to protests like this I mean these are these are the kind of protests I'm sure Martin Luther King would have known well these were necessary in order to forward the social good and then there and then there was a and then there was a fellow working for CNN who was blindsided by protests her knocked to the ground in the middle of the in the middle of his broadcast we have the tape of that one I know this is the one of the charlotte protester does anyone know or did anyone see who did the shooting or are you concerned that we're not sure okay so you have this girl screaming the cheese we don't want any video video would show that we might be wrong so no we don't have video because video would show that we might actually not be telling the truth about what happened in this particular shooting there was also a CNN protester screaming to CNN about Trump so that was that was lovely we have tape of that one also I believe yep that's it we were standing outside of police headquarters with about a hundred 150 people that were having conversations with police they were tense well there were still conversations things me sir things quickly devolved and then got out of it's just it's just terrific we've seen people looting Walmart we saw people loot the Charlotte Hornets arena quick note to the NBA quick note to the NBA okay the NBA wanted to pull game Charlotte North Carolina because of the fear for transgender people the Charlotte Hornets written just got looted I just got looted by some of these folks they're not pulling games out there I mean if fear is the real issue here wouldn't you think they might think about postponing games in Charlotte or not playing games in Charlotte if any minute there could be a conflagration and people should you could could go absolutely nuts there was by the way a CNN reporter who was knocked to the ground in the middle of all of this and this is just writing I mean it's just writing and some of the people who are protesters are there not even knowing what happened in the shooting they don't want to know what happened in the shooting because the truth would actually go against their case the truth would undermine everything they're trying to argue and that's their entire problem their entire problem is that the truth has no relevance here whatsoever and therefore it's totally okay for them to go out and riot on the basis of nothing so here is the fallout the fallout is the North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory he's now declared a state of emergency he says he hasn't heard from President Obama who's just absence all the time President Obama's not even a he's not even present he's not even a person in all of this here's the North Carolina governor talking about it I've just declared a state of emergency we're going to be bringing in National Guard right now to help the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department and we're also going to be bringing in State Highway troopers to supplement their needs primarily through a protect building so the police can arrest those necessary these people who are causing damage to buildings and also trying to harm people in in the great city of charlotte have you or have you heard from the President of the United States yet I have not no yeah shocker shocker President Obama goes completely absent but don't worry his surrogates are out there saying what he thinks here's Hillary Clinton saying you know the shooting of this guy again this shooting so far based on what we've heard is fully justified so we'll see if that's not true but the protesters don't know any more than you do they don't know any more than I do they're not even waiting to find out whether it's justified or not they're rioting Hillary Clinton doesn't wait either she jumps directly to the conclusion something terrible has happened here this guy gets shot after apparently pulling a gun on police officers and Hillary just chalks them right up to white racism there is still much we don't know about what happened in both incidents or you know that we have two more names to add to a list of african-americans killed by police officers in these encounters it's unbearable and it needs to become intolerable okay it's unbearable and it needs to become intolerable okay it's not intolerable for a cop to shoot someone threatening them with a gun I don't understand what does she want the cop to do just sit there and wait to be shot does she want cops to actually just put their lives at risk and never respond to violence this is insanity it is unbearable when people get shot unjustifiably it's quite bearable when they get shot justifiably and in this particular instance we don't know all the facts but we do know that the guy had a gun the family said he didn't have a gun that's line number one so that leads me to believe that the police are not lying about the rest of the story John Lewis this is an assault get-out-the-vote effort will explain that in a second John Lewis Democratic Congress person from Georgia he says black people have to get out and vote because of situations like this African American and all Americans must get out and vote like we never voted before I spent all day yesterday in Pennsylvania in Philadelphia speaking to religious leaders to ministers rabbis and Italian the people are listen they're going to turn out they're going to vote it's not Hillary Clinton raised to win along we all all of us must be involved in winning this election okay and this is what it's all about this is all just a giant get-out-the-vote effort there are riots there are shootings and then they say oh well this just shows America's a white racist country black people get out there and vote and they've got all of their all of their ridiculous racial arsonists like Al Sharpton out there making this case I'll Sharpton of course needs to be part of any racial story because what you really need when you're trying to calm racial tensions is a guy who helped instigate race riots in Crown Heights in 1991 and helped instigate the burning down of a store owned by Jews Freddie's fashion Martin New York in the mid 90s that's what you need you need to honey like Al Sharpton who trotted out the the Duke Lacrosse hoax but Al Sharpton says the thing here is that black officers even he's trying to deal with the fact that a black officers when he did the shoot he says black officers feel comfortable shooting black people that's racism too because if a black officer puts on the blue they basically turn into a white person is it that they want accountability of all law enforcement because the policeman and Charlotte is black this is not even race here so I think the one thing you're seeing is that the protests that are going on around the country many of which we've been involved in a national action network it's not an anti white on anti-police is anti accountability it's not anti white it's not anti police except for the fact that people are running around screaming about white people attacking white people in their cars dragging them down in parking lots and the brother of the guy who is shot is going around saying white people are all Devils so sure it's not racist then you have you know people like Whoopi Goldberg and this is where the cultural part of this comes into play Whoopi Goldberg she says that anybody who says that white lives matter is just ignorance and I don't know what Whoopi did to her hair here I know if she's gotten in a fight with a Black & Decker or what I mean she looks like something terrible happened but in any case here's what the Goldberg when you know when the black lives matter thing goes out there and then what the people say white lives matter that that shows an insensitivity to the it's not going to meet wait wait no no here's what has chose to me a slight bit of ignorance because it's not about know we've seen it we see you know white suspects doing all kinds of stuff with guns and do it and we don't see them get shot instantaneously but we do see we have seen we have seen a guy in a open carry state saying to please Allah I have one I need get shot anyway that's right so there is a disconnect for us we know white lives matter we know this is a lie it's like cops shoot white people in the same circumstances black people more often than they shoot black people and when she gives that example I assume that she's talking about the falando Casteel case up in Minnesota when she says somebody says to the officer I have a gun that's there's no evidence that that happened okay the officer disputes that accounts remember that tape started after the guy was shot so we don't have the full information there she's just taking for granted what the girlfriend said okay that may be right it may be wrong but that's all that she's saying there but again all this just generates a narrative that is not true that black people are being victimized by the police on a routine basis and that's not true statistically speaking but it does serve the Democratic agenda and in just a minute I'm gonna explain to you what that Democratic agenda is first we have to say hello to another new advertiser D STL DDS TLD comm / Ben is the place you need to go if you want jeans that are really affordable and nice D STL decom / Ben is the place to do it you can actually get jeans that would cost you hundreds of bucks starting at $65 I have a couple of pairs of their jeans again a lot of our advertisers are so wonderful that I actually go out and end up spending my own money on their products this is one of them they they gave me a free pair of jeans and then I went out and I actually bought a couple more pairs of jeans my wife is buying jeans from them it's D STL decom sprouts distilled but it's DST LD dot-com / Ben and the fit is terrific I mean you go on there and they and they you know you just put in your measurements and then they get you your and then they get you the jeans that you need and again the price is really trying and if you go to that if you go to that side es TLD comm / Ben you got ten bucks off your first pair they one of the reasons they're able to do it a lot cheaper is number one they don't have the brand markup at number two they also conserve material in a different way than a lot of jean manufacturers it's DST LD comm slash been for ten bucks off right now so your first pair of jeans is fifty five bucks as opposed to sixty five again DST LD comm slash Ben make sure you use the slash pen so you can ensure that you are able to that you can ensure that you are able to to keep our show going because then they know that we sent you so before we before we break here on make one more quick point and that is insta pundit who's the Glenn Reynolds professor at University of Tennessee law school he was briefly suspended this morning from Twitter and he was suspended from Twitter this morning after he after he tweeted that people should run them over and when he meant run but run them over with her a group of quote-unquote protests so they're actually rioters who are on the freeways and they were confronting cars and running at them and he was saying don't stop your car keep going he was suspended for that instant would suspend for that the video that he's linking to there you can see it in the tweet the video that he's linking to there mm-hmm looks like this this is what the video is he can see this large group of people rushing the car and then the car takes off so the idea here presumably timwagon me hillary clinton frog in my throat here apparently the the idea here is that he the the drivers just supposed to sit there and wait for the protesters to crack his windshield and drag him out of the car he tweeted run them over meaning keep going and Twitter and Twitter suspended him remember Twitter is biased Twitter is biased Facebook is biased I love both these sites they're biased okay Twitter suspends Glenn Reynolds for saying run them over DeRay McKesson who is one of the leaders of the of the black lives matter movement this extremist radical movement that lies to people and incentivizes people to commit violence against the police the guy who spoke at Yale and lectured at Yale and and wrote an essay and and recommended an essay called in defense of looting that guy does seminars with the head of Twitter the CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey he's never been suspended he's been up he's been upheld by Jack Dorsey as an example of social activism Twitter now has this logo right well if you type in black lives matter with the hashtag they give you a bunch of fists up raised like this right that's perfectly fine so black lives matter can say whatever crazy insane anti civilization things they want to say about violence nothing Glenn Reynolds says if somebody approaches your car keep going run him down and he's suspended from Twitter and he's suspended from Twitter because that's the way this goes okay if you want to watch the rest of the show
