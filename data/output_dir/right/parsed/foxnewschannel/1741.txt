>> Shannon: WE REPORTED LAST
WEEK ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT
SOMEONE INSIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
CAMPAIGN WAS A SECRET FBI
SOURCE.
TO MAKE THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE WANTS TO KNOW MORE.
>> THE REASON WHY A LOT OF US
WERE SUSPICIOUS IS BECAUSE GWEN
SIMPSON AT ONE POINT, THE HEAD
OF FUSION GPS TESTIFIED THAT
THERE IS A HUMAN SOURCE INSIDE
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BASED ON HIS
CONVERSATIONS WITH CHRISTOPHER
STEELE.
>> Shannon: FORMER CHIEF
ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY ANDREW
McCARTHY JOINS US LIVE WITH
REACTION.
GREAT DADDY WITH US.
I'M GOING TO TWEET IT OUT
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
AS FAMILIAR WITH THIS CASE
PRETTY WELL IN THE FACTS, THE
NAMES, THE DATES OF EVERYBODY
INVOLVED.
IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE.
GLENN SIMPSON, COFOUNDER OF
FUSION GPS IS A KEY PLAYER IN
THIS WHOLE THING.
HE TOLD LAWMAKERS ONE THING,
KIND OF TRIED TO BACKPEDAL AND
NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S BACK TO
SAYING WHAT I ORIGINALLY TOLD
YOU ABOUT THE SOURCING AND THE
START OF THIS WHOLE
INVESTIGATION WAS RIGHT.
>> IT'S INTERESTING.
THE TESTIMONY HE GAVE WAS THAT
CHRISTOPHER STEELE, THE FORMER
BRITISH SPY WHO WAS THE AUTHOR
OF THE DOSSIER TOLD HIM THAT THE
FBI TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD A
SOURCE INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN.
WHEN THAT BECAME A BIG
CONTROVERSY AFTER HE SAID IT, HE
TRIED TO WALK IT BACK.
IN THE WAY HE WALKED IT BACK WAS
TO TRY TO THROW IT OFF ON THIS
GUY PAPADOPOULOS, WHO HAD HAD
THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE U.S.
AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMAT.
THAT WHOLE STORY.
IT DOESN'T LINE UP TIMEWISE
BECAUSE WHEN HE GAVE THE
TESTIMONY IN AUGUST, THAT STORY
WAS NOT PUBLISHED UNTIL ABOUT
FIVE MONTHS LATER SO IT'S HIGHLY
UNLIKELY HE COULD HAVE KNOWN
ABOUT IT.
BUT WHAT I LEARNED THIS EVENING
IS THAT ON THE JUDICIARY, THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S
WEBSITE, SIMPSON'S LAWYER,
SIMPSON WAS ASKED BY THE
COMMITTEE, IF YOU CHANGED YOUR
MIND ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID,
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T LET US IN ON
THAT?
AND THE LAWYER FOR SIMPSON GAVE
A SHORT LETTER TO CHAIRMAN
GRASSLEY SAYING HE STANDS BY HIS
TESTIMONY.
>> Shannon: THE ORIGINAL
TESTIMONY THAT HE SAID TO
SIMPSON THAT THE FBI TOLD STEELE
THERE WAS AN INFORMANT OR
SOMEBODY WAS GIVING OUT
INFORMATION ON SOURCE INSIDE THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
HE'S BACK TO THAT STORY?
>> HIS BACK TO THE STORY THAT
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD HIM.
I WOULD UNDERSCORE HERE THAT HE
AND STEELE HAVE A LENGTHY
RELATIONSHIP AND COLLABORATION.
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS
HIGHLY UNLIKELY HE WAS CONFUSED.
>> Shannon: ANY HINTS OR
THOUGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE YOUR
OWN THEORY, EVERYBODY HAS
THEORIES, EVERYBODY IS SHARING
SOMEBODY INSIDE THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN STARTED WORKING WITH
THE FEDS.
WAS IT SOMEBODY THEY PUSHED INTO
THAT CIRCLE THAT THEY THEN USED
FOR INFORMATION?
ANY IDEAS?
>> I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH
YET BUT I WOULD SO EXPECT THERE
NOT BE JUST ONE BECAUSE IT SEEMS
LIKE -- WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN
RECENT DAYS IS THAT THERE WAS A
WHOLE OTHER THING GOING ON
OVERSEAS.
NOT IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SORT
OF WHERE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS
LOCATED, BUT DEALING WITH TRUMP
PEOPLE WERE IN BRITAIN
SPECIFICALLY AND THAT LOOKS LIKE
A FRUITFUL --
>> Shannon: INTERESTING BIT
FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ON
SATURDAY, INCREASINGLY TOP
OFFICIALS AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT HAVE PRIVATELY
EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE
LAWMAKERS ARE SIMPLY MINING
GOVERNMENT SECRETS THEY CAN
WEAPONIZE AGAINST THOSE
INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT,
INCLUDING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL,
ROBERT S MULLER THE THIRD.
HOW DO YOU WEAPONIZE INFORMATION
NOT SOMETHING NEFARIOUS ABOUT
IT?
>> I JUST THINK THAT IS SO
OVERSTATED.
AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE
MAKING A VERY NARROW REQUEST FOR
INFORMATION.
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY
NECESSARILY NEED THE NAME OF THE
INFORMANT.
BUT WHAT THEY NEED TO FIND OUT
IS WAS THERE ONE, THAT'S THE
IMPORTANT THING, AND I THINK,
SHANNON, EVERYBODY SENSIBLE
WOULD AGREE THAT IF THERE WAS A
CERTAIN QUANTUM OF EVIDENCE THAT
WAS SERIOUS THAT WE HAD A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS
IN CAHOOTS WITH THE PUTIN
REGIME, PARTICULARLY TARGETING
OUR ELECTION SYSTEM, THAT WOULD
BE SOMETHING THAT CRIED OUT TO
BE INVESTIGATED.
BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO SHOW
THAT THEY HAD A CERTAIN
THRESHOLD OF EVIDENCE BEFORE
THEY STARTED TO AGGRESSIVELY
INVESTIGATE A PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE
TRYING TO FIND OUT, DID THEY?
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK WE
WILL GET THAT TIME ON, THE WHO,
WHEN, WHERE, EXACTLY WHAT
LAUNCHED THIS FBI INVESTIGATION?
>> I DO.
I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS WE WILL
GET IT.
I KNOW THEY ARE ALL INTO LET'S
LOOK IN THEIR FILES AND LOOK IN
THE INFORMANT FILE.
AND I SPENT WEEKEND LOOKING AT
THE TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN PETER
AND LISA PAGE.
AGENT, THE FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE
WHO WAS THE COUNSEL TO THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI,
ANDREW McCABE.
THEY ARE A DAY BY DAY NARRATIVE
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE
INVESTIGATION AND THEY ARE
CONSTANTLY IN COMMUNICATION.
SO WITH RESPECT TO EVERY
DECISION THAT GOT MADE AND THE
DELIBERATION OVER IT, THESE TWO
ARE WEIGHING IN.
WE DON'T KNOW AS MUCH AS WE
COULD NO ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY
HAVE MASSIVELY REDACTED IT, BUT
THE WINDOW WE HAVE INDICATES TO
ME THAT IF YOU GOT TO SEE THAT
IT WOULD ANSWER A LOT OF
QUESTIONS.
>> Shannon: WE DO HAVE A LOT
OF QUESTIONS.
I'M GOING TO SEND THIS PIECE OUT
SO PEOPLE CAN READ AND MAKE
THEIR OWN DECISIONS.
