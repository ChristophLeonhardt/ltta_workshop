1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
As soon as China announced
it would remove term limits

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,250
on the presidency, its censors
and propaganda machine

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,230
kicked into gear.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,450
The surprise move would
clear the way for Xi Jinping

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,520
to stay in power indefinitely.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,470
It’s a break from
China’s decades-old rules

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,830
to prevent power from being too
centralized around one person.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,360
“In China, the most important
political announcements

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,940
are made through the
state-owned news organizations.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,050
This explosive news was announced
by Xinhua news agency

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,210
on Sunday in the afternoon.”

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,960
So how did officials
try to spin the news?

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,900
On Weibo, China’s version
of Twitter, China.com

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,390
published this video
focusing on the central role

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,130
of the president.

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,880
“In the face of the complicated
domestic and international

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,780
situation, this will
further promote

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,840
the sustainable development
of various great causes.”

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,480
China Central Television
ran a similar editorial,

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,040
stating that “the people
love their dear leader.”

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,160
Global Times, a Chinese daily,
published an editorial

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,100
recommending that people
“firmly support the

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,530
constitution amendment suggestion,
which is both the rational choice

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,090
and our belief.”

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,100
But the same day, it
published an editorial

26
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,336
that depicted the news
in a softer light,

27
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:14,960
saying, “The change doesn’t mean
that the Chinese president will

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,090
have a lifelong tenure.”

29
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,070
The People’s Liberation Army Daily

30
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,630
is the voice of the military.

31
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,490
It published a write-up
saying that soldiers

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,620
and armed policemen all
support the decision.

33
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,440
"President Xi Jinping
has consolidated

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,360
his control of the army,
and all of the soldiers

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,840
are supporting him 100 percent."

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,120
State-run media tried to control
the narrative in Hong Kong, too.

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,600
“That video was made
by the Ta Kung Pao.

38
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,280
It’s a pro-Beijing
Hong Kong newspaper.

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,020
And I think the most
important part of the video

40
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,530
is trying to let people know
that the Chinese constitution

41
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,850
actually had been
changed four times

42
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,080
in the past several decades.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,670
So it’s not a big deal.

44
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,840
So people don’t
need to freak out.”

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,670
But not everyone
was on board.

46
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,729
Chinese citizens took
to social media networks

47
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,750
to voice their
disagreements.

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,750
One user said he couldn’t use
the word “disagree” on Weibo,

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,700
because it was
apparently a violation

50
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,140
of the social platform‘s terms.

51
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,360
But perhaps not surprisingly,
those comments

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:00:00,000
were swiftly removed
from the web.
