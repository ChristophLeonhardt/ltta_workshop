1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,500
Looking back today when we say “Hey, we
bought the UFC for $2 million”

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,820
People say “Oh you stole it.”

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,780
Um, I’m not sure we did.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,340
I’m not sure it was worth $2 million when
we bought it.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,470
Lorenzo Fertitta is the CEO of the UFC, the
Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is currently

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,040
valued at about $4 billion. He owns it along
with his older brother, Frank Fertitta, and

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,020
their high school buddy, Dana White.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,400
Growing up in Las Vegas where there were no
professional sports teams,

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,820
Lorenzo got to watch a lot of boxing instead.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,170
I was really able to see some of the greatest
fights in boxing history.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,270
Lorenzo’s father started Station Casinos
in the 1970s.

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,660
Lorenzo and his brother took the company public in 1993,

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,420
when he had just  finished grad school.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,240
So you were a millionaire at 24?

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,700
Yes, yes.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,820
Then a few years later, he bumped into his
high school friend, Dana White, at a wedding.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,300
And I think we’ve probably talked to each
other 27 times a day since that day.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,489
So one day, Lorenzo, Frank and Dana all went
down to New Orleans to watch a big UFC fight

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,080
Nobody even knew the UFC was in town, that’s
how small as an event that it was at the time.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,740
There was no organization, there was no buzz.
I wanted to go buy like a tshirt or buy a

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,940
program, there was nothing there!

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,880
And it was really that moment when we were
sitting in our seats at that fight

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,310
when me Frank and Dana sitting in a row looked at
each other and said

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,280
The UFC wasn’t just unpopular, it was also
banned by almost every state athletic commission

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,229
and no cable networks would run the fights.
The owner, Bob Meyrowitz, was looking for

26
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,310
money to keep the business alive.

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,100
So I cold-called Bob, it was a very short
conversation. He said he was looking for a million dollars for half the business

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,680
So I talked to Frank, and called him back.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,060
And said, “We’re not interested in having partners.

30
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,040
"I’ll offer to buy the whole thing for $2 million.”

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,020
But $2 million didn’t get them much more
than a wooden octagon and some fighter contracts.

32
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,908
For the next, I would say five years, it was
a real grind.

33
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,959
The brothers spent $40 million trying to make the sport safer and more palatable.

34
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,730
We want to make it more fan friendly, we want
to get the crowd involved in it.

35
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,849
We had so much push back from networks when
we would go and pitch them and say, “Hey

36
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,129
we’re the UFC and we want to put fights on TV”

37
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,790
How many "No’s" did you get?

38
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,139
Every -- you count the networks! Everybody.
I mean we literally got to the point where

39
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,799
if we could have put in on the Food Network,
we would’ve put it on there.

40
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,279
We knew that just going out and selling fights
wasn’t working so we had to change our strategy

41
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:41,639
and that’s when we came up with the idea
of The Ultimate Fighter

42
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:46,620
Since they couldn’t get networks to pick
up regular fights, they made a reality show,

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,010
where each episode ended in a fight.

44
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,930
We like to say it was our Trojan horse.

45
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,719
Dana White hosted, and the overall winner
got a contract with the UFC.

46
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,430
The Ultimate Fighter ended up being the turning
point for the company.

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,079
But to get it on air, they bankrolled the
entire production themselves and gave it to

48
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,219
Spike TV to run for free.

49
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,540
And because we paid for it, we owned all the
rights. That was the key moment because even

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,719
today, one of the real points of value in
the UFC is that we own 100% of everything.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,540
Fine whiskey and good business!

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,300
Good business!

53
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,400
Only more good stuff to come

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,500
The UFC today has earned itself a spot as
a primetime sport and is watched

55
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,549
by millions around the globe.

56
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:33,549
The great thing about our sport is that everybody
understands fighting.

57
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,309
And we have the ability, because of that, to really appeal to everybody around the world.

58
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:41,520
So, you own fighting globally?

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,880
Well, we own the UFC,

60
00:03:43,940 --> 00:00:00,000
which is the strongest brand in fighting.
