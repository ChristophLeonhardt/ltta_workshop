could make history. What's in your wallet? PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS NOW THE DATE AND LOCATION HAVE BEEN SET FOR THE MEETING WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN, WHICH COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE COMING WEEKS. JOINING ME NOW FOR IN THE AUTHOR OF "NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN" AUTHOR GORDON CHANG. . THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. . THANK YOU. ELIZABETH: I'M GET IT OUT. AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE LEARNING THAT THREE HOSTAGES MAY BE COMING HOME. YES, THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I MEAN, THAT'S A PRE-CONDITION FOR TALKS, BUT ALSO, WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE FROM THE NORTH KOREANS. THERE'S POSSIBLY A FOURTH AMERICAN THERE, DAVID SNEDDON WHO DISAPPEARED UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IN 2004 FROM CHINA. MANY BELIEVE HE'S IN NORTH KOREA. I'D LIKE TO SAY THE NORTH KOREAN LEAD TOWER SAY WHETHER THEY'RE HOLDING OR NOT HOLDING SNEDDON. AND A, DO YOU EXPECT TO HEAR THAT NEWS AND IS THE PRESIDENT OVERPLAYING HIS HAND WHEN HE INDICATES IT'S THE NEXT FEW DAYS, AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS ROGUE NATION. MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND I UNDERSTAND THE CRITICISM. BUT MANY THINGS ARE GOING ON THAT MADE IT WISE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SAY THAT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS, IT'S NOT JUST THE U.S. VERSUS NORTH KOREA.
