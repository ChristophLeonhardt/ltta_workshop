DISASTER IN 2010 THAT KILLED 29 PEOPLE AND WHETHER HE VIOLATED SAFETY RULES AND STANDARDS. LONG STORY SHORT, MR. BLANKENSHIP WAS NOT A BIG FAN OF THE EVENTUAL REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, MR. MORRISEY WHO WE'LL TALK TO AND SEEMED TO HINT THAT HE MIGHT THROW HIS SUPPORT BY THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, JOE MANCHIN. MANCHIN INDICATING RIGHT NOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, THAT DOESN'T MATTER. HE WANTS PEOPLE TO VOTE THEIR CONSCIOUS BUT DIDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THAT MIGHT HELP. WHAT WILL THE FALLOUT BE AND EXPLAIN THE DISCONTENT WITH MR. BLANKENSHIP AND THE MAN I'M ABOUT TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW, PATRICK MORRISEY, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU. GOOD TO BE BACK ON YOUR PROGRAM, NEIL. THANK YOU. Neil: CONGRATULATIONS, SIR. DID YOU EVER GET A CONGRATULATIONS FROM MR. BLANKENSHIP? YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT ALL OF THE CANDIDATES ARE WORKING BEHIND MY CAMPAIGN. I KNOW CAMPAIGNS CAN BE VERY TOUGH. DON BLANKENSHIP IS A TOUGH COMPETITOR. THEY'RE ALL TOUGH COMPETITORS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT RAN IN THE PRIMARY AND I'M HOPEFUL IT'S A MATTER OF TIME THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL UNITE AGAINST SENATOR JOE MANCHIN. THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY PROVEN CONSERVATIVE RECORD VERSUS JOE MANCHIN. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT JOE MANCHIN SUPPORTED HILLARY CLINTON, BARACK OBAMA, SIGNED CAP AND TRADE LEGISLATION, KILLING COAL JOBS. SPONSORED A MASSIVE GUN CONTROL BILL. WEST VIRGINIANS WILL HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN A CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER THAT GETS THINGS DONE AND A LIBERAL THAT HASN'T DELIVERED MUCH OF ANYTHING AT ALL FOR WEST VIRGINIA. Neil: YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT SENATOR MANCHIN VIEWS THINGS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY. HE SAID THAT HE WAS REALLY THE ONLY TRUE CONSERVATIVE AMONG THE THREE OF YOU, TALKING ABOUT CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS THAT YOU DEFEATED AS WELL FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND SEEMED TO BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT BLANKENSHIP COULD ENDORSE HIM. I TAKE IT FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, YOU HAVE NOT HAD A CONVERSATION POST THE ELECTION WITH HIM? NO, I HAVEN'T. I THINK PEOPLE THOUGH, THE PRIMARY IS OVER AND RIGHT NOW MYSELF AND SENATOR MANCHIN. YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE THIS KIND OF STUFF FROM MANCHIN FOR A WHILE. HE'S GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO TRY TO RUN AWAY FROM HIS LIBERAL RECORD AND TRY TO PRETEND TO BE CONSERVATIVE OR HAVE WEST VIRGINIA VALUES. THE REALITY IS THAT THE RECORD ON THE ISSUES FOR JOE MANCHIN IS GOING TO PROVIDE A VERY STEEP HILL FOR HIM. Neil: YOU SAY LIBERAL. IN YOUR STATE, SIR, YOU CAN BE A MODERATE AND BE DEEMED A LIBERAL RECORD AND DONALD TRUMP IS VERY POPULAR IN YOUR STATE. WON THE STATE BY 42 POINTS. SO YOU'RE WELL-POSITIONED IN THAT BACKDROP. BUT I WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT SENATOR MANCHIN WAS TELLING ME, HIS WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT A FACE TWO OF A TAX CUT REPUBLICANS WANT TO HAVE. MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IN THE SENATE, BUT CERTAINLY GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE. I ASKED THE SENATOR ABOUT THAT. HE SAID HE WOULD VOTE FOR THAT IF IT CAME UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? I THINK IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT JOE MANCHIN SAYS ONE THING AND DOES ANOTHER. HE INDICATED THAT HE WAS OPEN TO VOTE FOR THE TRUMP TAX CUTS BUT HE VOTED KNOW WHEN THE PRESIDENT REACHED OUT TO HIM. JOE SEEMS TO SAY NO. I THINK VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS POINTED THAT OUT. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE A VERY BIG ASSET IN WEST VIRGINIA BECAUSE HE KNOWS I'M GOING TO BE A STRONG VOTE FOR HIS AGENDA AND FOR CONSERVATIVE WEST VIRGINIA VALUES. SENATOR MANCHIN Neil: HAS HE CAMPAIGNED I'M SORRY. DO YOU WANT HIM TO CAMPAIGN FOR YOU AND HE'S A INGREDIENT TO OR I WANT HIM TO COME. I HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION WITH DONALD TRUMP JR. HE'S GOING TO BE COMING IN. I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL COME BACK TIME AND TIME AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY HAD WEST VIRGINIA'S BACK. SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL FOR THAT. I THINK HE CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. HE HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN WEST VIRGINIA ALREADY.
