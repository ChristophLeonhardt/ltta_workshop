not far from the Welsh coast environmental activists keep a close eye on a huge Belgian registered ship we make hundred sixty four feet outside the dumping area it's come from a nuclear plant that's being built on the coast of Somerset in England and campaigners say the mud it's dumping at sea could contain dangerous radioactive materials they also say it's dropping its load outside a designated dumping area which lies less than two kilometres offshore the campaigners legal battle in the courts is still going on but they fail to get an injunction imposed and that means that ships like this can carry on dredging and dumping off the Welsh coast on an almost daily basis French energy giant EDF along with a Chinese partner is building a nuclear power plant known as Hinkley Point C next to two existing facilities the new plant should begin generating electricity in 2025 and the company says the dredging will allow six huge vertical shafts to be drilled for the cooling water system an EDF spokesperson told Al Jazeera all the permissions needed for dredging near Hinkley Point C are in place and the mud is no different to sediment found anywhere else up and down the coast the Hinkley Point C project team welcomes public discussion and has been open and transparent about the facts around this activity but this independent member of the Welsh Assembly argues that it's not clear a thorough environmental impact assessment was ever done they've only done one kind of testing and to identify the uranium and the plutonium particles which may or may not be in the mud they needed to do three types of testing the Alpha the mass spectrometry they only give gamma so therefore they just don't know and in that building over there there's a huge amount of ignorance and as I said they've allowed this country to be treated like a colony the Welsh government says international standards have been met but in recent weeks hundreds of people have demonstrated outside the assembly while a hundred thousand signed petitions calling for the mud dumping to stop the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence there is no argument against that and therefore the to caution the principles of the potato rethink the welsh government in this case of let the people down they've taken the last people for granted the people behind the protests say they have the law and increasingly public opinion on their side their legal challenge is set to resume next week nadine barber al jazeera cardiff
