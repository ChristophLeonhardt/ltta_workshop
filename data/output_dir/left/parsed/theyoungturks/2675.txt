>>PATRICK MEEHAN IS A
REPUBLICAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA, I
WILL TELL YOU HOW HE WAS ACCUSED
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, HE DID A
SETTLEMENT, ALTHOUGH HE CALLED
IT SEVERANCE, AND THAT IS A
LEGITIMATE DISPUTE, AND THIS IS
THE KIND OF STORY THAT BEGINS
WITH A HA-HA BUT LET'S HEAR THE
WHOLE STORY FIRST.
THE NEW YORK
TIMES REPORTED IT, AND THEY
EXPLAINED --
>>LOOK, I'M NOT SHY ABOUT SAYING
HA-HA, I JUST DID IT IN THE LAST
STORY ABOUT THE EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS WHO ARE NOW SAYING
FAMILY VALUES DON'T MATTER
BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP, AND BOY
THIS HAS HA-HA WRITTEN ALL OVER
IT.
HERE IS A GUY IN CHARGE OF
ETHICS FOR THE REPUBLICANS, AND
ONE LEADING THE CHARGE ON THE
ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, IT
TURNS OUT HE USED TAXPAYER MONEY
TO SETTLE A CASE.
BUT LET'S BE
FAIR, LET'S DIVE INTO THE
DETAILS AND FIND OUT THE WHOLE
STORY --
>>I'M GOING 
TO QUOTE AT LENGTH
HERE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE
PHILLY PAPERS AS WELL BECAUSE
THEY DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF
COVERING 
THIS --
>>SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU
SOME OF THE 
DETAILS OF THAT
LETTER BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE THE
LETTER, HE IS THE ONE WHO GAVE
IT IN, IT'S A MIXED BAG.
NOW,
HIM GOING HOSTILE IS A
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.
ALL THESE ARE
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES, YOU MAKE THE
CALL ON HOW YOU VIEW IT, BUT LET
ME KEEP GOING --
>>OKAY.
SO, THEN HE GOES AND
STARTS TALKING TO THE REST OF
THE PRESS ONCE THE NEW YORK
TIMES BREAKS THIS STORY.
SO IS
ANY OF THIS TRUE?
IT TURNS OUT A
LOT OF IT IS TRUE --
>>NOW, WHETHER YOU BELIEVE HIM,
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY, BUT HE
SAYS YEAH, I WAS INTO HER, BUT I
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT
DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH OUR
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP.
MMM,
NOT SO CREDIBLE.
SO HE SAID, NOW
TALKING TO THE PHILADELPHIA
INQUIRER --
>>MMM, OKAY, THAT IS
PROBLEMATIC.
LOOK, I 
DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT HUG, AND
MY ULTIMATE CONCLUSION HERE IS
GOING TO BE TO LET THIS ACTUALLY
PROCEED IN TERMS OF AN
INVESTIGATION THAT THE ETHICS
COMMITTEE IS DOING, AS THEY
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH
AL FRANKEN, WE WILL SEE HOW IT
TURNS OUT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
ALL THE DETAILS.
SHE'S NOT
TALKING, HER BEING UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE SITUATION IS
UNDERSTANDABLE, SHE HAD TO USE
HER OWN PRIVATE LAWYER WHICH SHE
DIDN'T HAVE MONEY FOR, IT
APPEARS BASED ON THE REPORTING
SHE TOOK ALL THE SETTLEMENT
MONEY AND BASICALLY GAVE IT TO
HER LAWYERS AND LEGAL COSTS,
ETC., SHE HAD NOTHING TO GAIN
HERE SO THAT'S SUPER IMPORTANT
CONTEXT AS WELL.
BUT IF IT'S A
HUG WHERE HIS HANDS WANDER,
GONE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO.
IF IT'S
A LONG HUG, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
MAKE OF THAT AND THAT IS WHY THE
DETAILS ARE INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT.
NOW, THE LETTER.
SO
MEEHAN FINDS OUT THAT SHE IS NOW
DATING SOMEONE ELSE.
HE DOESN'T
LIKE THAT, AS YOU WILL SEE HE
HAS ADMITTED TO THAT A LITTLE
LATER TOO, AND ONE OF THE THINGS
HE DOES IS WRITE HER THIS
LETTER.
WHAT IS IN IT?
HE SAYS
--
>>NOW, THAT'S WEIRD TO CALL HER
A PARTNER BUT SHE'S AN IMPORTANT
PART OF THE OFFICE AND IT IS
ARGUABLE THAT THEY WERE PARTNERS
IN THE OFFICE IN THAT SENSE.
HE
SAYS SHE WAS THE GATEKEEPER IN
THE OFFICE, NOT SOME LOW-LEVEL
STAFFER THAT YOU WOULD THINK IS
EVEN WEIRDER TO CALL A PARTNER.
BUT THIS IS WHERE I BEGIN TO
PAUSE IN THIS STORY, I WANTED TO
DO THIS STORY BECAUSE I WAS
LIKE, PERFECT, A REPUBLICAN IN
CHARGE OF ETHICS AND SEXUAL
HARASSMENT WHO USED TAXPAYER
MONEY TO SETTLE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT.
I THOUGHT THE LETTER
WAS GOING TO BE DAMNING, THOUGH.
IT WAS MORE SCHMOOPY THAN
ANYTHING.
BUT AS A BOSS, DON'T
BE SCHMOOPY WITH SOMEONE WHO
WORKS UNDER YOU, BY THE WAY.
BUT
IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I WAS
EXPECTING.
HE WENT ON TO SAY --
>>YOU SEE WHERE HE'S GOING WITH
THAT, THAT ISN'T GOOD.
TELLING
HER AS WE TRAVEL TOGETHER IN
THIS PATH, MAYBE OUR WHOLE STORY
ISN'T WRITTEN YET -- DON'T DO
THAT.
TERRIBLE IDEA, IT'S
TOTALLY WRONG.
NOW --
>>I BELIEVE THAT 
HE WANTED TO
KEEP THE ISSUE PRIVATE, FOR A
LOT OF REASONS.
THE WHOLE POINT
OF, LIKE, YOU ARE MY SOULMATE,
YOU ARE THIS AND THAT, I'M SO
INTO YOU, BUT I WANT TO REMAIN
LOYAL TO MY WIFE -- BUT THAT'S
WHY I PAUSE HERE.
BECAUSE
WHETHER HE WANTS TO REMAIN LOYAL
TO HIS WIFE OR NOT, THAT'S
BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE, HE'S A
REPUBLICAN, I DON'T AGREE WITH
HIM ON ANYTHING, BUT I DON'T
CARE IF HE FELL IN LOVE WITH
SOMEONE ELSE.
FALLING IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKS
UNDERNEATH YOU IS A DIFFERENT
ISSUE, AND THAT'S WHY I THINK
THIS IS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO
HERE.
HE EXPLAINED --
>>COME ON, COME ON.
IF SHE HAD
SAID YES, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALL OVER IT, IT'S SUPER OBVIOUS
FROM THE LETTER AND EVERYTHING
ELSE.
I GET IT, YOU'RE MARRIED,
YOU HAVE THREE KIDS, YOU HAVE TO
BACKPEDAL.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
AND IT'S THE SAME THING I SAID
ABOUT CLINTON.
ALL MY GOD, HE
LIED ABOUT SEX -- WHAT ELSE WAS
HE GOING TO DO?
OH, I SLEPT WITH
MONICA LEWINSKY, I WANT THE
WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW.
SO
BACKPEDALING, I GET IT IN REGARD
TO HIS WIFE.
ALSO --
>>THIS IS THE ONE I CALL THE
MOST B.S. ON.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE DID, IT SEEMS LIKE HE YELLED,
THAT'S WHY HE NEEDED AN
INVESTIGATION.
WHAT DID HE YELL?
WHAT DOES ROUGH MEAN?
BUT THE
EXCUSE THAT I WAS UNDER A LOT OF
STRESS BECAUSE OF A VOTE -- NO,
HE GOT PISSED THAT SHE HAD A
BOYFRIEND, HE WAS IN LOVE WITH
HER, SO HE TOOK IT OUT ON HER.
THAT'S WHERE IT APPEARS TO
DEFINITELY CROSS THE LINE, BUT
ONLY FROM THE THINGS WE KNOW,
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HER SIDE.
HENCE AN INVESTIGATION, ALL
RIGHT --
>>NO, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
DOMESTIC ABUSE SITUATION.
NOW,
THERE'S NO CHARGE THAT HE HIT
HER OR TOUCHED HER OTHER THAN
THE HUG SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR
ABOUT THAT, THAT'S WHY THIS IS
NOT NECESSARILY AN OPEN AND SHUT
CASE.
IT MIGHT STILL BE ONCE YOU
GET INTO THE INVESTIGATION, BUT
THE WHOLE TALK ABOUT YOU TAKE IT
OUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE YOU CARE
ABOUT, THAT'S TERRIBLE TALK.
HE SAID --
>>I GET IT, DUDE, YOU'RE
TOTALLY IN LOVE.
OKAY --
>>THAT PART OF THE 
STORY SEEMS
VERY CLEAR.
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TAKE THESE WORDS IN THE WRONG
WAY -- HE WAS SMITTEN WITH HER.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WAS
INNOCENT, YOU DON'T GET TO BE
SMITTEN WITH SOMEONE AND ACT OUT
ON IT.
YOU CAN BE SMITTEN IN
YOUR OWN HEAD ALL YOU WANT, BUT
YOU DON'T GET TO ACT OUT ON IT.
SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ACT OUT
IN THIS CASE?
LET'S GET TO THAT
--
>>DUDE, YOU DON'T TELL ANYONE
YOU ARE A SOULMATE UNLESS YOU
WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU ARE PASSING
SOME PERSON ON THE STREET, BY
THE WAY, YOU ARE MY SOULMATE --
NO, NO, I DON'T WANT TO EVEN
TALK TO YOU, JUST GOING.
OF
COURSE THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY TO
SOMEONE WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE
WITH THEM.
ANYWAY --
>>WHY WOULD YOUR BOSS NEED
ANY TIME FOR HIM TO ACCEPT THAT
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
FIRST OF
ALL, WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF HIS?
SECOND OF ALL, WHY DOES HE NEED
TO PROCESS THAT FOR SO LONG?
THIS PART OF THE STORY IS SUPER
CLEAR --
>>NO, DUDE, YOU SHOULD REPAY IT
NO MATTER WHAT.
LOOK, I GUESS IF
IT WAS A SEVERANCE, THAT IS IN
THE PURVIEW OF THE HOUSE AND HIS
JOB.
BUT IT'S A SETTLEMENT, I
DON'T CARE IF YOU DID IT SO YOUR
WIFE WOULDN'T FIND OUT OR
WHATEVER, THE TAXPAYERS HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
IF IT'S
A SETTLEMENT YOU SHOULD PAY IT
NO MATTER WHAT THE ETHICS
INVESTIGATION CONCLUDES.
OKAY --
>>THIS IS THE NEW YORK TIMES
EXPLAINING THIS, SOME PEOPLE GET
ON HIM FOR THIS AND SAY HE'S A
HYPOCRITE --
>>NO, ON THAT ONE I WILL DEFEND
HIM.
I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS
HE'S A HYPOCRITE.
IF HE HAD DONE
ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE THEN YES,
HE WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS,
TERRIBLE HYPOCRITE.
AND HE COULD
STILL BE A HYPOCRITE.
IF THE
INVESTIGATION FINDS OUT THAT
THAT HUG ISN'T A HUG, MORE THAN
A HUG, THAT HE'S A HYPOCRITE.
OR
HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND PUT
HER IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE AND
HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT -- THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOOD WORK
HE DID ON THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE,
AND BY THE WAY I HAVE NO LOVE
FOR THIS GUY, I DO AGREE WITH
HIM AT ALL ON POLICY OR
POLITICS, WITH THE GOOD WORK HE
DID ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISN'T A
THING YOU COUNT AGAINST HIM,
IT'S A THING YOU COUNT FOR HIM.
BACK TO MEEHAN, WE ARE ALMOST
DONE HERE --
>>A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET
ABOUT THAT TOO, BUT HE'S SAYING
SHE INVITED THE COMMUNICATION.
BUT A LOT OF THE HEADLINES ARE
MISLEADING.
THEY SAY SHE WAS
INVITING IT -- HE DIDN'T SAY SHE
WAS INVITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT,
HE SAID SHE WAS INVITING THE
LETTER.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
TRUE, MY GUESS IS IT ISN'T, BUT
AGAIN YOU NEED THE INVESTIGATION
TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND HE SAID
IT HURT HIM THAT SHE WASN'T
COMFORTABLE WITH ANY OF THIS.
FINALLY, HIS LAST QUOTE IS --
>>NOW, HE MIGHT GENUINELY
BELIEVE THAT, AND THEN REALIZE,
NO, IT IS WRONG FOR A GUY WHO IS
THE BOSS OF A WOMAN AT WORK TO
SAY, BY THE WAY, YOU ARE MY
SOULMATE, AND THEN GET ANGRY
WHEN SHE DOESN'T RECIPROCATE,
AND TO MAKE HER SO UNCOMFORTABLE
SHE LEAVES WORK.
AND I THINK
THAT'S WHY THIS IS INTERESTING
AND PRODUCTIVE ANYWAYS.
BECAUSE
I THINK GUYS LIKE MEEHAN,
SOME OF THEM, GENUINELY DIDN'T
KNOW THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO
DO. AND IF YOU ARE AT HOME
GOING, NO WAY, THAT'S CRAZY, I
UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT TRUST ME,
SOME OF THEM DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT.
I WAS JUST IN LOVE WITH
HER, WHAT ARE YOU GETTING ON ME
FOR?
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T PUT
HER IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE
YELLING AT HER BECAUSE SHE HAS A
BOYFRIEND, THAT'S CRAZY.
AND IT
MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THAT.
THERE
ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES, YOU
HAVE TO BE FAIR TO EVERYONE
INVOLVED.
I DIDN'T FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THIS STORY, IT WASN'T A
STORY I WALK AWAY THINKING, WHAT
AN AWFUL HYPOCRITE.
I WALK AWAY
THINKING HE SHOULD REPAY THE
MONEY, THEY SHOULD DO AN
INVESTIGATION OF HIM AND FIND
OUT WHAT EXACTLY HE DID AND
PERHAPS REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE
IF SOME OF THIS IS PROVEN OUT,
BUT IT'S NOT A THING WHERE I GO,
WHAT A MONSTER AND HE SHOULD BE
TARRED AND FEATHERED AND NO ONE
SHOULD EVEN BOTHER TO DO AN
INVESTIGATION.
LOOK, EVEN IF HE
IS KICKED OUT, THE CONVERSATION
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY ONE
SITUATION LIKE THIS, WHERE GUYS
LIKE MEEHAN GO, RIGHT, I DIDN'T
REALIZE IT WAS MAKING HER
UNCOMFORTABLE, YOU MIGHT THINK
THAT IS DISINGENUOUS AND IN THIS
CASE IT MIGHT BE, BUT AT LEAST
FOR PEOPLE TO START THINKING
THAT WAY SO THEY KNOW, DON'T DO
THAT TO SUBORDINATES, DON'T USE
YOUR POWER IN THAT WAY, BECAUSE
YOU ARE AFFECTING THEIR CAREERS.
AND EVEN IF HE NEVER GETS IT,
IF WE HAVE THE CONVERSATION
NATIONALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WILL BE AT LEAST AWARE OF THE
SITUATION THEY WERE NOT
ADEQUATELY AWARE OF BEFORE.
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE MOVEMENT
IS GREAT.
