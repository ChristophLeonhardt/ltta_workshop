the New York Times former newspaper has joined with the Boston Globe in more than 300 other newspapers in publishing an editorial attacking Donald Trump in unison for falsely accusing them of attacking him in unison like in the editorial the newspapers joined in celebrating an independent Free Press by acting in perfect conformity all expressing the exact same opinion celebrating their independence and the freedom to be exactly like all the other independent papers saying the same thing freely and independently as long as it's the same the Times editorial was written by their editorial board which includes Sarah Jang who says she enjoys being cruel to old white men the board also includes several old white men who presumably enjoy being treated cruelly by Sarah Jang and of course there are some women and dark-skinned men who I guess just like watching that sort of thing all in all the Times editorial board sounds like some kind of fun S&M dungeon where some other sick pornographic fantasy for filthy minded perverts and therefore deserves our respect the editorial says in part quote in answer to the vicious attacks on the press by Donald Trump we hereby unite and viciously attacking Donald Trump which okay we've been doing for about three years now but this time we really mean it Trump's false claim that the news media has become a corrupt arm of the Democratic Party and other far-left socialist institutions will be forever put to rest by this demonstration of how much we all hate him for standing in the way of the Democratic Party with his false accusations rest assured as a free press we will continue to defend free speech by assassinating the character of anyone who disagrees with us unquote the editorial was first published yesterday but you can probably still read it if you pull it out of the bottom of your canary cage and brush the bird crap off it until you can read the horse crap underneath trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show I used to give you there's a real need also sing see top see lower the zipa teasing it's all right we are on the brink of the Clavin this weekend don't panic oh wait no that's the wrong advice panic sorry but we have a big show if Jenna Ellis is gonna come on talk to us about the Colorado picker who has got that poor man is in trouble again they are just they just will not stop hounding him Michael Reagan is also going to be on to talk about his attempts to keep the memory of our history alive which is really interesting first we want to talk about movement watches like this beautiful watch that I'm wearing now one of my many movement watches I love these things and I know you look at this and you say how can they afford to sell this at the prices they do is because they take out the vowels without the expensive vowels it's just M V M T that's how you spell movement and without the vowels it's just a lot cheaper a watch that would cost you I don't know you know 400 to 500 bucks and in a department store without the vowels it's just from 95 dollars up this company has grown like crazy and now with almost 2 million watches sold 160 plus countries they continue to revolutionize fashion in the belief that style shouldn't break the bank they've also expanded the sunglasses and fashion-forward bracelets for ladies and they just believe in looking good and keeping it simple without the vowels that's all important get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns by going to movement comm / Andrew that's M V M T right CY movement keeps growing check out their expanding collection go to movement dot-com / Andrew movement without the vowels and the MT join the movement or the movement whatever just oppose does that so it's just an interesting thing a new Rasmussen poll shows the trumps approval rating in the black community is now up around 36% which is unbelievable he started down around 8% and I predicted this was going to happen for a simple reason I've happened to notice that black Americans have eyes to see with and ears to hear with and they know when they're being gamed I mean how long can you game a person before he catches on but it also tells us something else it also tells us that in the battle between Trump and the press which is this pitched battle it's like Moriarty in homes with their hands wrapped around each other's throat as they go off the Falls together Trump's winning Trump is winning because this has been their main avenue of attack as it always is everyone who disagrees with the left is a racist say that you know a guy is stupid he happens to be black oh you said it because he's a racist not because he's stupid but you may also be right if you say the President Obama was as incompetent and corrupt you said it not because he was incompetent corrupt no it couldn't be that it's got to be because his skin happens to be a little tanner then your skin that's got to be what you're taught thinking about so you know now they've got this routine so all of this and they just do it and do it and do it and people aren't listening because their lives are getting better because America is getting better because we're at peace they've seen Isis has been wiped off they've wiped off the face of the earth they see the Trump is behaving and you know even though his his weird personal behavior is weird is as behavior as president is within the bounds of the Constitution they can see this with their own eyes and it doesn't matter what the press keeps hammering away at now they're on this Omarosa this obvious person he called her a dog so it's got to be because she's black and a woman but he's called Mitt Romney a dog he called Michael Wolfe a dog oh this is a thing he says so but don't be afraid of this because Brian Williams is investigating his cut number two does this president really physically not like dogs that's right Brian he's actually the first president in more than a hundred years who's not had a dog as a pet in the White House he has lived with a dog before when he first got married to his first wife Ivana she brought with her a poodle he resisted the dog he didn't want to have anything to do with the poodle but she said the poodles coming along chappies coming along turns out chappy didn't like Trump very much because whenever Trump would come near Ivana's closet chappy would bark at him I'm glad we got to the bottom of that see this is the problem the press has that everything Trump says about them is true it really is interesting you know if they would just either if either Trump or the press would just age a little bit toward compromise if Trump would say you know what you know yeah the Russians fiddled with through election but that had nothing to do with the results I won because I want if he would say that you know they wouldn't be able to get him on this constant you know oh it's a witch hunt and whatever he says but if the press would just say you know what you know what Trump is right we are biased there are too many Democrats too many people not enough Trump voters no Trump voters at any of our editorial spots if they would just move a little bit but they are no matter how badly Trump behaves they behave worse and people ultimately think to hell with them you know why should we do and it's not just the press it's the whole Democrat Party but I repeat myself because the Democrat Party and the press are the same thing you know let's let's take a look the other day I think was yesterday Chris Cuomo is less intelligent brother I can hardly believe those words are coming out of my mouth the governor of New York and here's what he had to say to the people and lit this is his people listen to their reaction we're not gonna make America great again it was never that great we have not reached greatness we will reach greatness when every America is fully engaged we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women 51% of our population is gone and every woman's full potential is realized and unleashed and every woman is making her full contribution when that happens this nation is going to be taken even higher because we have not yet fully liberated the women in this country so let me get this straight we won we are the first we were the first constitutional republic in our time all the others are imitations we won two world wars and the Cold War setting all of the world free not a single person who is politically free does not owe a debt to the United States of America but the problem is our women are living in The Handmaid's Tale they you've seen them on the street with those Flying Nun ATS and all the red things and being for to bear other people's children you see this in front of you except you don't accept it's all in his imagination but he is not the only one on the left that you know karl rove has a piece in the journal today he says New York New Jersey senator Cory Booker declared that we are at a time where injustice has grown to be normal in our country Elizabeth Warren says the hard truth about our criminal justice system is it's racist I mean all the way front to back and and this rope points out this doesn't speak well a former attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch who made the justice system what the way it is today they had eight years to change it it's not Donald Trump's justice system it's still theirs California senator cap Kamala Harris joined the assault telling Netroots that our criminal justice system has failed besides vowing not to be shut up by opponents of identity politics this Harris unconsciously took a swipe at President Obama's record saying we have an economy that is it work for those at the very top but not for those doing the hardest life in America is awful according to these people Alexandria occasional Cortes the Democratic Socialist who became the left overnight sensation told Netroots that Immigration and Customs Enforcement these law enforcement officers has repeatedly systematically and violently committed human rights abuses this is the way the Democrats talk about America this is the way they talk about America no matter what Donald Trump is doing no matter what they say no matter what tape they come up with they're worse they are they're worse than he yes they cannot come up with a charge they hate the country they keep telling us they hate the country and listen to won the primaries yesterday listen to the Democrats won the prominent firm primary yesterday this is diversity diversity is our strength you know that diversity is our strength here's a diverse group of people there's Randy Bryce who was an admitted drunk driver he's got he's going to try and get the seat of Paul Ryan the House Speaker in Minnesota keith ellison won his nomination for attorney general while denying accusations that he abused a former girlfriend Democrat Archie Parnell in South Carolina admitted to beating his wife decades ago and he won a congressional primary and oh and Oh in Vermont the governor the a Democrat running for the governor of Vermont is let me see if I've better yeah I do Christine Hollis here's Don Lemon he I don't know what to call he's a guy who dresses up as a girl so I guess that makes him a transgender or something yours there his interview with Don Lemon do you see this is a victory for all transgender Americans all Americans yes I do see it as a victory for all of Americans but I will tell you it's no surprise to me living in Vermont I love Vermont and this is pretty typical for what Vermont is Vermont's been a loving state a leader in civil rights and we're gonna continue to show the rest of the country what good democracy looks like good democracy looks like a guy in the skirt I mean it's like it's like a Monty Python routine by the way it's not talking people who have gender dysphoria who have problems with this but really really I mean that's what good democracy looks like I mean just like like Monty Python all right never mind but here's a tip for all of you guys in skirts and not skirts Dollar Shave Club is the way

and say how do you spell Clavin it's que la vie aan have we got Jena Ellis with us let us bring on Jenna Ellis she is the friend of the show a director of the Dobson Policy Center a contributor to the Washington Examiner she has a book which I just finished reading which I really I really will you and I will have to talk about this book a very interesting argument about the Constitution called the legal basis for a moral Constitution a guide for Christians to understand America's current constitutional crisis but all of that is paled by the fact that you were now tweeted by the President of the United States I was I was so impressed I was reading the Twitter of you I thought I know her I know Jenna that's and yeah that was my phone just immediately blew up with all these people going I know you this is you this is amazing and it was quite an honor to now be featured in the president's Twitter feed absolutely I mean you know my my one ambition left in life is to be the answer to a crossword puzzle but that's pretty close I have to say all right so what is going on with this poor guy in Cal tension yeah what is what is going on with this big cake baker you just got out of trouble the Supreme Court let him let him go and now he's back in trouble again yeah you know this is just a relentless attack on religious liberty by the state of Colorado and what's going on is that of course everyone's familiar with the masterpiece cake shop opinion that was handed bound by the Supreme Court that strongly condemned the very same Commission for showing overt hostility and animus against religious freedom and Jack the cake baker for refusing to decline refusing to create a custom cake on the basis of his sincerely held religious beliefs and so what happened now is that he's back in front of the exact same Commission which found probable cause that he discriminated this time against a Colorado attorney who is a self-proclaimed transgender who on the very same day is this a coincidence I don't think so the very same day that the Supreme Court agreed to take up masterpiece cake shop case called masterpiece and asked for a blue exterior pink interior cake that was specifically intended to celebrate his transition from male to female of course masterpiece declined respectfully and now the Colorado Commission rather than following the masterpiece opinion from the US Supreme Court is again frankly just overtly harassing Jack making him go through the system and this time Alliance defending freedom which are his attorneys they're fighting back they actually filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday night in the collar at a district court claiming that the Commission is not following the opinion and asking for a permanent and continuing injunctive relief basically stopping the Commission from enforcing the anti-discrimination Act and Colorado law against Jack I mean this is so obviously persecution and the one of the things the supreme court cited in their decision was the clear animus that the Commission had against this guy which I don't see how they're going to disprove having gone right back against him but does this speak at all to the a lot of people at the time complained about the narrowness of the Supreme Court's decision does this give credence to that yeah absolutely and you know from a from a legal perspective this is a really bad strategic move for the Commission for several reasons one is because this is again showing just their overt hostility for them to find probable cause when this was clearly just an attack and a set up against jack but then this is providing yet another opportunity to go back in front of the Supreme Court potentially and Justice Kennedy who wrote that majority opinion that was very narrow to have the opportunity with potentially a Justice Brett Kavanaugh and a 5-4 conservative majority that would implement a better decision like justice Thomas's or justice course such as concurrent that should provide a much broader opinion and a broader protection and application of the First Amendment really interesting you know I was just thinking about that Cavanaugh when he was nominated there was all this noise about roe v wade because that's what the left thinks is going to move the country against him but kind of a to me I think it occurred to me while I was reading your book actually that obergefell was so the one putting gay marriage essentially inserting gay marriage into the Constitution was so poorly decided since the Constitution gives no power to the federal government to rule on marriage at all it was so badly decided I thought maybe that would be the one that Cavanaugh would be far more likely to overturn since it's fresh and hasn't become precedent do you think there's any truth to that yeah yeah I think that all of these unconstitutional Supreme Court opinions whether it starts with you know Griswold versus Connecticut in 1965 finding you know these emanations from the number of the Constitution that's so you know with yeah with it with this crystal ball the justices can somehow find rights that aren't specifically enumerated and articulated and then give the government unilateral power to somehow restrict those rights so anything that flows from that case in 1965 which would include Roe versus Wade Planned Parenthood versus Casey obergefell all of these social issue cases that have just advanced the sexual revolution those will now probably and hopefully be up for reconsideration with a genuinely conservative court that would say these were unconstitutionally decided and actually adhere to the Constitution and reverse those decisions and that would be a great thing for our country to actually abide by our Constitution that we had maybe a new idea I know so where do you think Cavanaugh is in the confirmation process how do you think he's doing I think he's doing great he's definitely been meeting with the key senators over the past few weeks and then the Senate Judiciary Committee just announced a last week in that September fourth the day after Labor Day will be the initial hearings that will begin and the process that happens is that initially he goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee they will then issue a report to the full Senate that can be positive negative or neutral but that's not binding of course on the votes that's just kind of their report and then it'll go before the full Senate for consideration and vote and because the left forced the nuclear option with Gorsuch and 51 votes as majority is now the Senate rule for confirmation that's the only threshold that Brett Cavanaugh has to look at and I think he will get there without question interesting interesting you know I have to tell you there are so many questions I have to ask about your book so I want to bring you back and do that specifically I won't do it now Jana thanks so much for coming on it's always good to talk to you thanks Peter like yeah we have to talk we have to bring her back and just talk about the book which is he'd make some arguments I've never heard before which is pretty rare at this point I think I've heard everything but it you know just did go back for a minute though to this that what I was talking about before about the fact that the problem that the press has and the problem that the Democrats have is that it's just apparent to people who have eyes and ears which is like a lot of people it's apparent that they have behaved very very badly so anything they say about Trump just kind of keeps coming back on them and that was true with this John Brennan when they pulled his security clearance you know the thing the thing about polina got security clearance is it cost some money you know he's out there selling his expertise John Brennan has a contract I think with NBC he's out there selling his expertise he's going he can be consulted go to do consultancy work and say yes I have an inside track so when he when this happens to him and the press oh my goodness he's punishing his enemies but the the people remember since we started by saying this the people aren't listening to the press because the press is just behaved so badly so what do people say what do you say what do I say when we I hear that John Brennan's his security clearance has been pulled I think well okay what did he do and what did Trump do well what did Brennan do he's say first of all he set up Trump on this ridiculous Russia investigation he accused him of treason he's been you know he's just been an insidious blowhard he has been a gas bag from the beginning with his big words and he's just let's play here's let's listen to Brennan's reaction to having his security clearance pulled which by the way is a privilege it's not a right he just made just something they do as a favor to him let's see it listen to his reaction I've seen this type of behavior and actions on the part of foreign tyrants and despots and autocrats for many many years during my CIA and mass security career I never ever thought that I would see it here in the I states and so I I do believe that all Americans really need to take the stock of what is happening right now in our government and how abnormal and how irresponsible and how dangerous these actions are he said it was a threat to his free speech and you can hear how he's been silenced utterly silenced I mean what a what a gas bag the guy like he's talking about Trump as a foreign tyrant because he pulled this privilege that he had after he's done all this so here's Sarah Sanders so here's the thing right if the people are not listening to the media if they're not listening to the media narrative they're making decisions on their own that's what we started with they're making decisions on their own so they listen to the gasbag the insidious gasbag and then they listen to Sarah Sanders who's reading Trump's statement on pulling Brennan's security clearance mr. Brennan has a history that caused into question his objectivity and credibility in 2014 for example he denied to Congress that CIA officials under his supervision had improperly accessed the computer files of congressional staffers he told the council Foreign Relations that the CIA would never do such a thing the CIA's inspector general however contradicted mr. Brennan directly concluding unequivocally that agency officials had indeed improperly accessed congressional staffers files more recently mr. Brennan told Congress that the intelligence community did not make use of the so-called steel dossier in an assessment regarding the 2016 election an assertion contradicted by at least two other senior officials in the intelligence community and all of the facts additionally mr. Brennan has recently leveraged his status as a former high ranking official with access to highly sensitive information to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations wild outburst on the internet and television about this administration mr. Brennan's line and recent conduct characterized by increasingly frenzied commentary is wholly inconsistent with access to the nation's most closely held secrets and facilities the very aim of our Viserys which is two so division and chaos so you hear the insidious gasbag gasps bagger e and then you listen to that which is absolutely accurate description of what john brennan has been up to both in the office and since he has gotten out of office and I think most people are going to come to the same conclusion as Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana I think most Americans look at our our national intelligence experts as being above politics mr. Brennan has demonstrated that that's not the case he's been totally political I think I called him a Butthead and I'm in it I think he's given the national intelligence community of the UH a bad name I love this guy I love John Kennedy who will say anything anyway this is the problem they had why the press is losing why I think the Democrats are losing a lot more than maybe the polls show because they have just behaved badly and they have behaved badly for a longer time than Donald Trump it's almost speaking of people who behave badly Michael Knowles is gonna be on the conversation Tuesday August 21st 5:30 p.m. Eastern 2:30 p.m. Pacific Knowles will answer your questions moderated by our lovely host Alicia Kraus who makes dealing with Knowles look almost effortless almost the Q&A will

mailbag yesterday and we'll have another one next week all your problems solved subscribe what are you doing with the 10 bucks anyway right nothing all right Michael Reagan is of course the son of President Ronald Reagan and the president of the Reagan legacy foundation the foundation just recently opened its walkway to victory a world war two memorial in France and Michael joined me to talk about that and a lot more here's Michael Reagan thanks so much for being here I appreciate it great to be here thank you very much for having me so you've always been a very clear-headed viewer of politics but before I talk about the president I think I want to talk about the past because you're doing a lot of work with the Reagan legacy foundation based around World War two if I got that right yeah World War two actually I got a radio in 2009 really to carry on the legacy of my father and do what I could lift him up worldwide if you will and we started the Legacy Foundation as a way to raise money scholarships if you will money for the men and women who serve aboard the USS Ronald Reagan and we started that way back when and that's worked that's so well over the years and the kids really enjoy the fact that we go to the ship we get on the ship we provide the scholarships well we do something else we give scholarships also to the family members who are at home trying to better their education so we give a thousand-dollar scholarship to the kid on the on the on the ship and 2002 the family member left home and and it's just so fulfilling to be able to do that so that's where it started and then I went to gosh Germany a few years back and I was talking to a young man I said what do you know about the Berlin Wall he said the Americans put up to keep the Communists out there said no he said yeah and I went really and I walked around there was nothing about Ronald Reagan in Berlin at all nothing so I start working with the Maur museum checkpoint charlie museum and just as they were doing the 20th anniversary of the fall of the wall we open up a Ronald Reagan exhibit there at the Malheur Museum in Berlin and it's right over checkpoint charlie and a few years ago after browbeating the German government forever they allowed us to put a plaque in the ground to commemorate the speech in 1987 so we have that in the ground which is great we worked with the poles to have a statue of my father and Pope John Paul and condense Poland and then a few years ago I was going to go to Normandy and I was playing golf with a 28 year old young man and I told me I said I'm going to France tomorrow why Paul I'm going out to Normandy on Sunday I've been asked to raise the American flag at the American Cemetery in Normandy on Sunday and he said to me why is there an American Cemetery Normandy Wow so sorry and I said to him I said did you think d-day was the day your report card game oh and by the end of the round I figured out he's the normal and he is the normal yeah kids still believe you know what they believe about America and Germany they probably do believe well you put up to keep the Communists out of your sector they don't know why there was a second world war who fought the Second World War who died in the Second World War so we began to work with Normandy and that has been just so wonderful what we've been able to do in Normandy over the last few years we've built around with Reagan Center Saint Mary clee's Normandy France first town freed by America on d-day 4:00 a.m. in the morning he's got the 101st 82nd airborne they 505 all of them there and then we made another agreement with them just this last year to start doing a walkway to victory and people could go online walk way to victory calm and purchase a brick to honor a veteran of World War two fought European theater and we lay the bricks all through the the area there of the other Museum at Normandy France it's just wonderful just played the first 300 bricks does it ever bother you when you think of the fact that Ronald Reagan freed so many people and I won't say he did it single-handedly of course not but he had a vision that other people around him did not have I remember you know he said we were gonna win the Cold War no Nobel Prize no remembrance of him in the media I mean they gave Obama a Nobel Prize basically just for showing up does that bother you yeah why it bothers me but it wouldn't have bothered him uh-huh okay because he wasn't doing it for the price right what was the placard on his desk no telling what a man can accomplish where he could go if he doesn't worry who gets the credit right today unfortunately have too many people why and take credit and getting nothing done right Ronald Reagan didn't mind sharing the credit because he looked at the big picture we want the Berlin Wall to come down who do I work with pope john paul ii elect melenz Vaako Havel Helmut Kohl Margaret Thatcher and ultimately Mikhail Gorbachev they all ultimately brought that down yes you can give credit to my father for bringing the team together but all of them working together were able to accomplish much yeah although yeah I mean I it bothers me when I hear people crediting Gorbachev who would have happily kept the Soviet goalie if he could have done it he just couldn't what was that first meeting my dad had Gorbachev said listen you can you can go along with what I want you to do or we can just bankrupt you yeah and so what he did was just bankrupted right well I you know when I look back at Ronald Reagan that mean we are now getting some really wonderful conservative policies accomplished but the personality of what helps today and the personality White House back then very very different Reagan always was acknowledged for his good humor his kind of elegant way of I mean he was very harsh with Democrats but he did in a very elegant gentle way what is your reaction to seeing Donald Trump I mean let's talk about both policy and personality what what how do you react policies are fine personality sucks it's really I have an op-ed piece that I'm writing and I baked the op-ed pieces about Donald Trump that if he allows his personality to take over his accomplishments he will lose and and you so you have people out there who really dislike him personally yeah and my fear is that that will overshadow the accomplishments that he has on the board with the tax cuts and all the positive things that are going on with unemployment and what-have-you across the United States of America you know my father as I said in a tweeted at Reagan world the other day I said my father never reacted to the negative press that was coming in his direction ever which was just as announced yeah but he ended up winning the Cold War because he didn't react to the press he didn't have the thin skin that this president seems to have about anything and everything okay on Monday of inaugural week I called president-elect left a message for his office I said congratulations I want to welcome from the 40th first family I like to welcome the new 45th first family to the ballroom and they say it's going to be a week you will never have another one like it it's going to be your day enjoy it and what have you give that message to the president president-elect and that's where I left it three hours later my phone rings now look at my phone and it's Trump I go I better take the call so I take the call now what do you think the first thing Donald Trump says to me I'm afraid to ask but he says you know you didn't support me in the primaries I'm thinking to myself really I called to say congratulations enjoy this week and you come back and say you know you didn't support me in the primaries but that's that's him yep and then he said you know I didn't know your dad but I liked your dad because I liked your dad I like you and we need to have a round Gregan day at the at the White House I said great we'll have a you know a Trump day at the reagan ranch if you're willing we talked about that and congratulations and so on and so forth and hung up but the first thing he said to me to remind me I told my said I sixteen other choices I said I did support you when you won the one the at the convention is it that's right you did keep track of every human being on the planet I've heard the theory that after your father got elected the press it's not not in a conspiracy sense but just an emotional sense decided that things had gotten away from them and they never wanted this to happen again and if you chart the bias of the press which today is almost absurd I mean the bias the the left-wing bias of the press is now beyond anything I've ever seen and it was always biased to the left but now it's just as do you think that maybe there is a reason why it took a Donald Trump to get elected that maybe someone as elegant and soft-spoken as your father would have been up against it remember Ronald Reagan was not a politician either hmm a good citizen politician but he wasn't a politician right so it's the angst against politicians getting you know absolutely nothing done right if you will did you have the answer so it's to see a fresh face if you will and the fact that let's be honest Donald Trump was lucky he was running against Hillary Clinton yeah I mean I don't even think bill voted for Hillary hey come on I mean it was the luckiest talking about draw poker ball boy on this one I'm running against Hillary you know and and and so it was kind of a weird election in that way but you know there's a lot of media out there today and left and right and I will tell you my father you got together with Tip O'Neill yeah at the White House I don't think you'd do that today I don't think a Republican can invite like a Tip O'Neill the White House and and put together a package of many sorts and not catch hell yeah from everybody and I also I say this I think today Ronald Reagan would have a hard time getting nominated by the Republican Party and I think John if can t be a hard time getting nominated by the Democrat Party can't even be too conservative Greg would be too liberal you think Reagan would be too liberal for today's yeah I think he would be too liberal yeah well I go back because what happens today what you did in the past no matter what you did later is held against you in the court of public opinion governor raised taxes governor signed abortion bill yeah now he gave the money back after he got more money in the coffers in California but you never hear that side him right and and he what's that nothing with that and said I've changed my mind on abortion right so but again he did cited an abortion bill he also back in 1986 gave you Simpson Mazzoli right so how would Ronald Reagan you know do today within the Republican Party and and I think it would be very tough for him I think if he got through the process he'd win but it's hard to get through the process anymore as it would be for John F Kennedy Pro tax cuts you know Pro you know pro-business pro-military that guy would never see the light of day in his everybody his feet just sound like a Republican speech when you go back and look at Kennedy's speeches they sound like a republic yeah but you did Ronald Reagan go back to listen to his speeches when he was a Democrat right he was a conservative Democrat he just changed over to become a conservative Republican he was still the conservative when if when you look if you could chart an imaginary course for the country for the next ten years and and everything goes right what would you like to see how what I would like to see happen i well i like to see happen is I'd like to see an immigration bill yeah and before anything else I'd like to see an immigration bill because until until that's solved you're gonna have problems in the United States or Americans just going to have problems they're truly in the United States America I would like to see education taken away from washing just like my dad tried to but couldn't when he was elected I think the educational system in America is creating socialists not conservative that's why young America's Foundation who I speak for and do things for and what we do in a couple of weeks again it's so important on the conservative side of the equation the education system if we don't fix the education system we're not going to fix America just not going to happen yeah and and we've got to come to realize why is Chicago like Chicago why are there so many killings because back in the 1962 Don Lemon one night on CNN I said the problem you guys have is you think the history of the country started this morning when you got out of bed it's totally true I said you go back to 60s what did we do in the 60s we told husbands if you want your wife we just gave birth to your baby to get welfare you have to get out of the house so we chased the husband's out of the house babies were born with no fathers in the home right what is the gang it's a family if you destroy the family on this side they're gonna find a family on that side and the family becomes the Crips the Bloods ms-13 whenever the family is but we refuse to look at the past to learn from it we keep on putting band-aids on this side of it and it never gets any better and that's really sad so bring that brings us back to where we started you if you're setting up a walk of victory so people who understand what world war two is you set up a something a checkpoint charlie so people understand what are you trying to teach people with these things what do you want them to learn what I want to learn is what the history this country really is why they speak English not German right okay who these people were you know these people did that flu who flew in and parachuted into into into that area of the world in the France back on d-day what they are trying to accomplish seventeen eighteen year old kids we're doing this and they ended up saving saving the world and we're not teaching this in school we were teaching school we don't teach what they did at law we don't we don't lift up America one thing to upset my father more than anything else we used to talk about this when Americans went overseas and pointed fingers back in America and blamed us for anything he said no one should blame America for anything who wasn't for America where would the world be and-and-and we need more leaders like this that quit you know quit blaming America but lifting up America dad talked about the shining city on a hill we need to be talking about that shining city on the hill and why it's a shining city and start looking at the good side of America what's a Santa's gravesite in all men there is good Ronald Reagan looked for the good in all men we're not looking for the good today cuz we don't get ratings looking for good we get rich looking for bad yeah when you started looking for good we weren't talking about Ronald Reagan and lift up Ronald Reagan they start looking for the good Michael Reagan thank you very much for coming on I appreciate it good to be with you clearly Michael not listening getting the word from Andrew Cuomo that America is no good I don't know I don't know how that communications broke down all right stuff I like announcing this majesty stuff I like Chris eyes good guitar nice riff haha you want to where are the things that always bugs me is that there's so much new stuff coming out and I appreciate that especially on TV is really is still maybe not still the Golden Age of TV but it's still a Silver Age of TV but nobody goes back to the old stop I always used to notice this in movie places when they used to have remember when they used to have you know video stores before everything streamed you would go in and that like blockbusters walls and walls and walls of movies that were released two months ago and then one little section of what they would call classics you know and you think like how the movie industry has been here's it was really at its peak in 1939 people should watch this stuff it holds up it's not like it's dated or anything like that and TV is a little different because TV really was bad TV really was bad until it started to be good and that's and it started to be good right around the 80s I would say 1980s was when some of the stuff started but I remember I was writing in the 90s these mysteries and crime stories with very troubled characters guys who weren't typical good guys guys who were kind of anti heroes and I got a lot of flack for it and then one day I remember I was watching the shield the first episode of the shield and I said to my wife you know it's all gonna be on TV now they're all the stuff that they yelled at me for doing they're gonna be doing on TV and that's what happened but if you go back into the 90s you if you haven't seen it you should watch NYPD Blue it holds up brilliantly today it is by two of the absolute pioneers of the Golden Age of TV Steven Bochco who in the 80s put on Hill Street Blues which was a jaw-dropping a jaw-dropping bully show when it first came on and you saw you know the cops kind of portrayed as real people doing real things yet you know you just went like whoa what this is totally new totally new structure of storytelling and then he went on and joined up with David Milch who went on to do Deadwood so these are two of the Giants of the TV Revolution and they created the show NY blue it started out with these two actors Dennis Franz and David Caruso and after the first season Caruso who was kind of legendarily tough to work with quit in the middle of the second season because he wasn't getting the contract thing he wanted he thought well I'm a star now I'm just gonna go off and to end he went off and when did movies and they bomb and suddenly he he was you know not only humiliated he actually kind of got the point he came back and he said you know what I was kind of a jerk and I should have treasured what I had and he wound up on CSI Miami and created a character there but he never ever hit his peak as he did in NYPD Blue has his performance as Detective Kelly is just unbelievable and the structure of it you could see as I'm watching the first episode and I saw it a couple of times when I was on but I never really watched and I've just gone back to watch it from the beginning I watched the first episode I thought man the plotting in this is just perfect the acting is great they really are and Dennis Franz terms in a performance he became the star of the show this kind of not incredibly handsome overweight guy who played a cop like we had just not seen on television before a good guy cop was a little bit racist he was a little bit prejudiced against people and he would go in and treat a bad guy not so much by the book so here's a scene of Dennis Franz you know just going in talking to a white having a conversation with a wife-beater yeah you're going to central booking to get processed for beating your wife she's pressing charges oh she sure is okay now I got to get an attorney you know it's making people around Frank no you sure likes making your way through there's a lot more to it you only like hitting women killing me along all right here's what's gonna happen Frank you're going in the system get out whether it's a week or a month from now I'm gonna be there waiting for you and then I'm gonna drive it to a bus station and I'm gonna buy you a cup of coffee and a candy bar you're gonna get on that bus and you're never gonna set foot around here again I will put you in a hospital you got it yeah that's just great tough guy stuff and Franz was great he used to live in Santa Barbara and I'd see him all the time and of course he's perfectly nice gentleman but I and it is a terrific show NYPD Blue if you haven't seen it go and take a look also before we say goodbye we got to say goodbye to Aretha Franklin one of the truly truly great voices we'll close with a little stuff from her she died at 76 and another thing is they always play her later stuff and she was great through most of her career but her early stuff when you hear her voice it was just like a voice of an angel really beautiful stop all right we got to say goodbye the clayvin this weekend is here do
