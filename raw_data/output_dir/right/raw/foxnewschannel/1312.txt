2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,359
EVENING.

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,526
WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON

4
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:07,893
TONIGHT.

5
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:09,462
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT ABC

6
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:10,830
CANCELLED ITS MOST POPULAR

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,430
SCRIPTED SHOW YESTERDAY

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,466
AFTER A LEAD ACTOR SENT OUT

9
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,234
A SERIES OF BIZARRE TWEETS

10
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:16,569
WHICH SHE LATER BLAMED ON

11
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:17,270
SLEEPING PILLS.

12
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,404
YOU'VE READ ABOUT IT BUT

13
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:20,439
THERE IS AT LEAST ONE UPSIDE

14
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,342
TO THE ROSEANNE STORY.

15
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:24,644
THE LEFT IS ON THE RECORD

16
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:25,611
OPPOSING RACISM.

17
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:26,445
ATTACKING PEOPLE ON THE

18
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:27,780
BASIS OF THEIR RACE, THEY

19
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,981
ARE TELLING US, AND OF

20
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:29,815
COURSE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY

21
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:30,449
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

22
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,051
LET'S HOPE THIS CONVERSATION

23
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:33,386
CONTINUES AND PROGRESSES.

24
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:35,187
LIBERALS MAY FINALLY CONCEDE

25
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:36,522
THAT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON

26
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:37,890
SKIN COLOR REALLY IS WRONG

27
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,392
WHETHER IT'S IN HIRING OR

28
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:40,493
PROMOTIONS OR GOVERNMENT

29
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:41,927
CONTRACTING OR SCHOOL

30
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:42,295
ADMISSION.

31
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:43,229
THEY ADMIT THAT, THAT WOULD

32
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,397
BE REAL PROGRESS.

33
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:46,465
IT'S NOT HAPPENING YET

34
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:46,866
THOUGH.

35
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,067
FOR NOW AMERICAN LIBERALS

36
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,201
ARE STILL LIVING IN THAT

37
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:51,003
STRANGE IRONY-FREE WORLD

38
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,338
WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE TO

39
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:53,406
DENOUNCE RACISM EVEN AS YOU

40
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:54,674
COMMIT IT.

41
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:56,676
THAT'S THE SAME WORLD AL

42
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:57,743
GORE OCCUPIES WHEN HE FLIES

43
00:00:57,743 --> 00:00:59,245
PRIVATE SUCCESS JETS TO

44
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:00,379
GLOBAL WARMING CONFERENCES.

45
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,814
IT'S THE PLACE WHERE

46
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:02,615
ATTORNEYS GENERAL CAN YELL

47
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:03,716
AT YOU ABOUT DOMESTIC

48
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:05,251
VIOLENCE EVEN AS THEY BEAT

49
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,419
UP THEIR GIRLFRIEND.

50
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:07,620
IT'S HYPOCRISY LAND.

51
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,288
IT'S WHERE LIBERALS LIVE.

52
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,456
LAST NIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE,

53
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:11,924
MSNBC HELD A TOWN HALL

54
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:13,259
MEETING DEDICATED TO

55
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:14,160
FIGHTING RACISM.

56
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,162
GUESS WHO THEY INVITED TO

57
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:17,463
LECTURE AMERICA ON THE

58
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:17,763
TOPIC?

59
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:20,399
YOU GUESSED IT, RACISTS.

60
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,134
THE SPECIAL WAS LITERALLY

61
00:01:22,134 --> 00:01:23,402
CO-HOSTED BY AL SHARPTON,

62
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:24,070
REMEMBER HIM?

63
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,971
HE IS THE GUY WHO RIDICULED

64
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:28,374
JEWS IN NEW YORK AS, QUOTE.

65
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:28,908
DIAMOND DEALERS.

66
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:30,509
HE IS THE ONE WHO DENOUNCED

67
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,411
A JEWISH STORE OWNER AS A

68
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:33,379
WHITE INTERLOPER.

69
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,980
THAT INSTA

70
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,815
THAT INSTIGATED A RACIAL

71
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:36,949
MASSACRE IN WHICH 8 PEOPLE

72
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:37,650
WERE MURDERED.

73
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,251
ALSO ON STAGE LAST NIGHT WAS

74
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,821
A GUY CALLED TIM WISE.

75
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,856
WISE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS

76
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:44,890
PROFESSIONAL ANTIRACISM

77
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,825
ACTIVISTS WHICH OUGHT TO BE

78
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,526
A TIPOFF THAT HE HIMSELF IS

79
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:49,195
A RACIST, WHICH OBVIOUSLY HE

80
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:49,462
IS.

81
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,997
HERE IS WISE USING MSNBC'S

82
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:56,202
PLATFORM TO MAKE UGLY

83
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:56,902
GENERALIZATIONS BASED ON

84
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:57,503
SKIN COLOR.

85
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:58,371
>> WHITE AMERICA HAS BEEN

86
00:01:58,371 --> 00:01:59,872
RAISED TO BELIEF A, THE

POLICE IS ALWAYS THE GOOD

88
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:03,175
GUYS AND FRANKLY THAT BLACK

89
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,510
LIVES MATTER LESS THAN WHITE

90
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:04,844
COMFORT.

91
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:06,612
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS MY

92
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:08,413
DISCOMFORT WITH YOU RIGHT

93
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,149
NOW IS WORTH MORE THAN THE

94
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,550
POTENTIAL THAT YOUR LIFE

95
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,918
COULD BE SNUFFED IN 10

96
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:16,021
MINUTES.

97
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:16,589
>> Tucker: ISN'T THAT

98
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:17,656
SLANDER AGAINST AN ENTIRE

99
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:18,824
RACIAL CATEGORY?

100
00:02:18,824 --> 00:02:19,892
OH, YES, IT IS.

101
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:21,460

KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS WHAT

00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:31,070
LIBERALS ARE NOW CLAIMING IS

110
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,572
THE OPPOSITE OF RACISM.

111
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:36,842
>> THE GENTRIFIERS OF TODAY.

112
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:37,877
THEIR PARENTS OR

113
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:38,644
GRANDPARENTS RAN AWAY FROM

114
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:40,112
THE CITY TO GET AWAY FROM

115
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:41,347
BLACK AND BROWN FOLK.

116
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:42,615
AND NOW THEIR CHILDREN AND

117
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:43,616
THEIR GRANDCHILDREN ARE

118
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:46,786
SAYING, OH, THE SUBURBS,

CITY AND GET MY LIFE IN THE

123
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:52,525
CITY.

124
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:53,626
WHEN I DO THAT I NEED TO

PEOPLE TRYING TO GENTRIFY

165
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:45,544

SLAVES TAKEN FROM AFRICA

188

00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,779
OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK

195
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,682
FLOODING INTO THEIR COUNTRY.

196
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:24,383
>> Tucker: MAYBE IT'S MORE

197
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:25,618
AN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND I

198
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:26,685
THINK, BY THE WAY, THERE ARE

199
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:29,021
FAIR QUESTIONS TO RAISE

200
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,890
ABOUT RADICAL DEMOGRAPHIC

201
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,924
CHANGE FOR SURE.

202
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:33,158
IT UPSETS PEOPLE.

203
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:34,393
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.  BUT,

204
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:35,528
TO PRETEND THAT IT'S ALL

205
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,464
ABOUT RACE AND THAT ONE RACE

206
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:39,932
IS WORSE THAN ANOTHER RACE,

207
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:41,433
ISN'T THAT THE DEFINITION OF

208
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:41,767
RACISM?

209
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,235
>> ABSOLUTELY.

210
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:44,603
TIM WISE IS GOING TO BE ABLE

211
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,205
TO PAY HIS RENT THIS MONTH

212
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:48,007
BECAUSE HE IS A RACIAL PIMP.

213
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,141
THAT'S WHAT HE IS THAT'S

214
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:49,875
WHAT HE DOES.

215
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,710
HE TRAVELS AROUND THE

216
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,445
COUNTRY GOING TO COLLEGES,

217
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:55,548
TELLING YOUNG WHITE MEN AND

218
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:56,215
YOUNG WHITE WOMAN THAT YOU

219
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,216
ARE A RACIST AND THAT YOU

220
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:58,884
ARE A BENEFIT OF WHITE

221
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,152
PRIVILEGE AND THEY GO ON AND

222
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,620
THEY TELL THEIR PARENTS HOW

223
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,255
TERRIBLE THEY ARE BECAUSE A

224
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:04,523
GUY NAMED TIM WISE CAME TO

225
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:05,891
MY COLLEGE AND TOLD ME I

226
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,092
HAVE WHITE PRIVILEGE.

227
00:05:07,092 --> 00:05:08,260
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT TIM IS

228
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,328
DOING, HE IS ASSUMING A

229
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:10,829
PRIVILEGE THAT, QUITE

230
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:11,797
FRANKLY, I DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE

231
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:12,731
THAT HE HAS.

232
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,267
I HAVE ZERO SENSE OF

233
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:15,668
INFERIORITY.

234
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:16,368
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

235
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:17,703
THAT SOMEONE LIKE TIM WANTS

236
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:18,470
ME TO BELIEVE.

237
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,805
IN FACT,.

238
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:20,406
>> Tucker: YOU THINK HE

239
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,308
WANTS YOU TO HAVE A SENSE OF

240
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:22,708
INFERIORITY?

241
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,343
>> ABSOLUTELY.

242
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,044
PRESIDENT BUSH TALKED ABOUT

243
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:27,313
IT HE SAID IT'S THE SOFT

244
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:29,415
BIGOTRY OF LOW EXPECTATION.

245
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:29,882
>> Tucker: YEAH.

246
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:30,549
>> THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

247
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:31,317
AROUND THE WORLD AND WHAT'S

248
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:32,084
HAPPENING IN AMERICA.

249
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:33,152
THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING

250
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:35,120
TO TELL YOUNG BLACK MEN AND

251
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,255
YOUNG BLACK WOMEN HAVE YOU

252
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,590
NO CHANCE IN AMERICA BECAUSE

253
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,891
OF YOUR PIGMENTATION.

254
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:39,692
NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

255
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,827
THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT

256
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:42,261
DEMOGRAPHICS.

257
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,429
ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT

258
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:43,929
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

259
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,564
MY WIFE IS ACTUALLY HER

260
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,566
PARENTS ARE FROM PANAMA.

261
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,867
HER PARENTS CAME HERE

262
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,102
LEGALLY WITH NOTHING.

263
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:52,171
THEY WERE ABLE TO CLIMB THE

264
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:52,805
SOCIOECONOMIC LADDER.

265
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:54,406
BOTH OF THEM OBTAINED THEIR

266
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:54,740
DEGREES.

267
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,574
BOTH THEIR DAUGHTERS

268
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:56,575
OBTAINED THEIR DEGREES.

269
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:57,576
YET, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

270
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:59,244
ARE, I GUESS SOME WOULD CALL

271
00:05:59,244 --> 00:05:59,979
ME AN AMERICAN.

272
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,347
I DON'T ANSWER TO THAT TERM.

273
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:02,581
I'M AN AMERICAN BLACK

274
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:02,915
PERSON.

275
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:05,184
OBVIOUSLY CAN YOU TELL BY MY

276
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,418
PIGMENTATION I'M BLACK.

277
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:07,486
BUT THERE IS LOTS OF PEOPLE

278
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:08,687
EVEN IN MY EXTENDED FAMILY

279
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,255
WHO HAVE NOT ATTAINED WHAT

280
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,324
SOME OF MY IN-LAWS HAVE

281
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,392
OBTAINED REGARDLESS OF THE

282
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:14,660
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.

283
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,794
BUT TIM WISE WOULD YOU HAVE

284
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:16,996
TO BELIEVE THAT SIMPLY

285
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:17,863
BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF YOUR

286
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:18,764
SKIN YOU CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL

287
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:19,665
IN AMERICA.

288
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:21,266
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

289
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,468
PRESIDENT TRUMP, GOD BLESS

290
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:23,435
HIM, WHAT HE IS DOING WITH

291
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:24,870
THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW, IT'S

292
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,839
HELPING BLACK PEOPLE.

293
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,439
>> Tucker: WHERE DO YOU

294
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,273
THINK A COUNTRY WINDS UP

295
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,808
WHERE THE OFFICIAL POSITION

296
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,577
IS THAT THE RACES ARE

297
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:32,511
DIFFERENT, SOME ARE MORE

298
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,446
MORAL THAN OTHERS.

299
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,515
AND BASICALLY, THEY SHOULD

300
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:37,216
HATE EACH OTHER?

301
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,951
THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT A

302
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:50,996
LOT OF OUR ELITES ARE FOIS

303
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:51,964
TING ON THE REST OF US.

304
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,132
THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY BY

305
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:56,101
TEARING PEOPLE APART.

306
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:59,738
UNHYPHENATED AMERICA WHAT IS

307
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:00,673
UNHYPHENATED AMERICA?

308
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:01,473
IT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

309
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:02,875
IF YOU BELIEVE IF YOU

310
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,343
EMBRACE IF YOU PROMOTE THE

311
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,411
PRINCIPLES OF LIFE, LIBERTY,

312
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:06,879
AND THE PURSUIT OF

313
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,246
HAPPINESS.

314
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:08,414
THEN YOU ARE AN AMERICAN.

315
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,416
AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANY

316
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,583
PREFIX OR SUFFIX.

317
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,618
YOU ARE JUST AN AMERICAN.

318
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:14,253
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE

319
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:15,521
PREACHED AND TAUGHT ON OUR

320
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:16,789
COLLEGE CAMPUSES INSTEAD OF

321
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:20,259
HAVING THE TIM WISES AND AL

322
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:20,693
SHARPTONS.

323
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:21,694
>> Tucker: WHEN I WAS A KID.

324
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,127
I'M 49.

325
00:07:22,127 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT THAT OLD.
