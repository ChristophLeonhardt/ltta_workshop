world waits as we are now three days away from the Trump baby blimp taking flight a campaign that began as something of a lark British organisers fundraising to hoist a diaper clad Trump baby into the skies over London to troll Trump on his visit now that effort has begun to capture the imagination of Trump critics around the world and tonight we can report this baby trolling has drawn a formal response from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani who tells a British paper that it's London's mayor who should be ashamed over the Trump baby balloon insult and he said that basically the problem in London is the crime is spiraling crime in London is higher this year than the past but no great evidence of a crime wave now all of this is bigger than a baby to be fair most things are but now upwards of 50,000 Brits are expected to protest Trump's visit there some likely to be marching in the shadow of the giant baby blimp and Trump's likeness and as we've reported Trump is known to rankle at the idea he is a baby once asking Paul Manafort am I like a baby to you now on the trip Trump will overnight in London and also visit his own golf course in Scotland Street protests not the only source of opposition here either we should note that some lawmakers spoke out against giving Trump the honor of a formal state visit by giving this rare accolade of a state visit a to president Trump the implication is that we approve of him and his policies regardless of why people voted the way they did a Pandora's box of heat has been opened these views are not to be accepted they're not to be tolerated we're joined now by Assad Raymond the director of the charity war on want one of the organisation's coordinating these massive protests expected in London what is the value in your view of these international protests and what do you think the turnout will be thank you very well we expect hundreds of thousands of people to actually be on the streets in nine simultaneous protests across the U just a small drop in the overwhelming majority of British people who have time at time again have rejected not just Donald Trump the person but the politics and policies that he represents and that's very much why he suspect so much anger and resistance the only his his on individual policies but the fact is war of migrants the Muslim ban his planet wrecking policies he has managed to mobilize people right across the political spectrum who say this is not just simply about a man it's about the policies and politics he represents well I do well know he's not the first American president to engender significant protest abroad and other American presidents have been criticized for expansionist war policies for high death tolls from American foreign policy is there something in your view that is specifically or explicitly worse about this president and do you think you'll affect Americans if the protests are big enough well first of all one of the reasons why we're holding these protests is because of the special relationship the UK and the u.s. holds together but our special relationship is with the people of America and it's particularly with the people of America or on the streets day after day of protesting against Donald Trump's normalization of sexual violence his normalization of Islamophobia all of the policies that have put so many people on the streets of the United States to stand up against bigotry and ated hatred and to protect human rights and so that's so our protest hopefully is sent a very powerful signal that that kind of politics would be normalized and briefly we've been covering and it's been getting some some attention the Trump baby blimp the president very sensitive about the idea that he's a baby where does that fit into these protests well we know that the president is notoriously since skinned de nan√£ narcissist so the idea of a baby Trump flying over Westminster whilst Donald Trump has to be hidden away in country retreats because he was unable to have any meetings in central London is a fitting testament and a very British response to Donald Trump and I'm sure it'll get under his skin oh it's funny you mentioned that you believe him to be I believe you said thin-skinned babies also known for sensitive skin hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
