LUCAS TOMLINSON LIVE FROM THE PENTAGON THIS MORNING. DOES IT MEAN ALL U.S. TROOPS ARE COMING OUT OF IRAQ? NOT ALL THE TROOPS, SANDRA. THERE IS UNIVERSAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IN THE PENTAGON THAT PULLING THE TROOPS OUT IN 2011 WAS A BIG MISTAKE AND NOT TO BE REPEATED. IN THE SMALL CEREMONY TO BAGHDAD YESTERDAY THE U.S. MILITARY DISBANDED ITS HEADQUARTERS OVERSEEING GROUND TROOPS IN IRAQ AS THE WAR AGAINST ISIS WINDS DOWN. 5,000 U.S. TROOPS WILL STILL BE ON THE GROUND. IN A HIGHER LEVEL U.S. LED COMMAND WILL REMAIN IN BAGHDAD TO ADVISE THE IRAQI MILITARY COUNTERPARTS AND MAKE SURE ISIS STAYS UNDERGROUND AND DOESN'T HOLD TERRITORY. A U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS TASK FORCE WILL ALSO REMAIN. IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH IT HAS WOUND DOWN ONLY FIVE AIR STRIKES LAST WEEK COMPARED TO 21 IN SYRIA. IN DECEMBER HE IS FACING PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS LATER THIS MONTH INCLUDING AGAINST SOME IRANIAN-BACKED CANDIDATES. Sandra: WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE FOR U.S. TROOPS IN NEIGHBORING SYRIA. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH REPORTERS YESTERDAY DEFENSE SECRETARY MATTIS DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ALL 2,000 TROOPS PULLED OUT OF SYRIA BEFORE THE DIPLOMATS HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO WIN THE PEACE. ON CAPHILL HE TOLD LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE COMPLEX BATTLEFIELD INCLUDING OTHER FIREFIGHTERS AND ALSO OFFERED MORE DETAIL ABOUT A MASSIVE U.S. STRIKE AGAINST RUSSIAN MERCENARIES IN FEBRUARY. THE RUSSIAN HIGH COMMAND ASSURED US IT WAS NOT THEIR PEOPLE. MY DIRECTION TO THE CHAIRMAN WAS FOR THE FORCE THEN WAS TO BE ANNIHILATED AND IT WAS. FAIR TO SAY A HOLDING FORCE RIGHT NOW WITHOUT US WOULD BE A RISKY PROPOSITION FOR A WHILE TO COME? I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY REGRET IT.
