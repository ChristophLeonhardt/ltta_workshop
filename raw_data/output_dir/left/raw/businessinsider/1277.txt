00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,909
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump being elected president</font>

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,220
Trump running for president maybe one of

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,990
the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that's ever happened for</font>

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,570
feminist and feminism I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to</font>

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">my daughter the other day who was who</font>

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,380
was upset about this and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said there</font>

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,070
look it's on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> table it's there we we</font>

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,320
know these Billy Bush conversations are

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,960
taking place let's deal with it and

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,650
recognize too that this sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,410
this momentum in feminism and away we go

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,430
is actually a false false view we're not

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,730
adding substantially<font color="#CCCCCC"> to women who are</font>

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,420
CEOs of big companies that stalled out

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,280
gender diversity in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my old industry the</font>

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,960
financial services industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall Street</font>

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,600
stalled out in fact going backwards over

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,480
some period of time so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make</font>

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,460
sure we understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facts rather than</font>

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,800
operate in a world in which we feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,039
hey where everything's<font color="#CCCCCC"> great but it's</font>

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,500
all below the surface where I also feel

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,629
optimistic is that things are different

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">than they were 10 15 20 years ago women</font>

25
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,939
have more choices women have more

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,310
options 15 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could have</font>

started<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own business 20 years ago</font>

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,080
leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company to have a</font>

non-traditional career path of

freelancing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> part time wasn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">available either we have more options I</font>

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,720
think we might look back at this period

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,360
a handful of years from now and say that

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">was actually a watershed and positive</font>

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,380
moment for feminism and the advancement

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">of women we hope we hope you know we</font>
