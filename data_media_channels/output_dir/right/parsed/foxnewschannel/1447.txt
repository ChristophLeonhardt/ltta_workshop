AT CONCLUSION THIS HOUR WE'LL
SING HIS STANDARD, GOD BLESS THE
USA.
BRIAN: THAT IS STAR POWER THERE.
WE HAVE STAR POWER HERE.
ON SCREEN LEFT, GERALDO RIVERA,
165 POUNDS OF PURE FURRY.
TO MY IMMEDIATE LEFT --
STEVE: 155.
BRIAN: HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?
>> 155.
BRIAN: COREY LEWANDOSKI, THE
COAUTHOR OF TRUMP V TRUMP, WHO
DID ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING.
>> HE HAS ALL THE SOURCES.
MUCH BETTER LOOKING.
>> ONLY ONE SAID TRUMP WAS GOING
TO WIN.
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE SOME
OBSCURE DELEGATE IN MAINE WOULD
PUT HIM OVER THE TOP.
>> WE WON THAT DELEGATE.
AINSLEY: YES MORNING WE WERE ALL
STILL AT FOX.
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER OUR SHOW AND
THE LETTER WAS RELEASED, THE
PRESIDENT SAYING I'M CANCELING
THIS MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA.
WHY DO YOU THINK HE DID THAT.
>> LOOK, THIS PRESIDENT IS A
DEAL-MAKER AND WE KNOW THAT WHAT
WE'VE SEEN FROM HIM THE FIRST
PRESIDENT IN OUR LIFETIME
BASICALLY, 30 YEARS OF AMERICAN
FOREIGN POLICY, WILLING TO
ENGAGE NORTH KOREA TO
DENUCLEARIZE THE PENINSULA.
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP
BECAUSE ADMINISTRATION AFTER
ADMINISTRATION PRIOR TO HIM HAS
NOT BEEN WILLING DO TO THAT.
IF CREE WILL NOT ACT IN GOOD
FAITH WE'LL JUST NOT GO THERE.
PRESIDENT SAID WE'RE WILLING TO
DO THIS, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SOME
CONCESSIONS AND THOSE
CONCESSIONS ARE TO DENUCLEARIZE.
THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP.
BRIAN: WHEN WAS IT CLEAR THIS
WASN'T HAPPENING AND HOW
SAY I'M OUT BEFORE THEY'RE OUT?
>> I THINK THAT IS SIGNIFICANT
BUT TO ME THE WRITING WAS ON THE
WALL WHEN THE KOREAN AND
NORTH KOREAN ADVANCE TEAM NEVER
SHOWED UP IN SINGAPORE WITH OUR
LOGISTICAL PEOPLE.
SEEMED CLEAR THEY WERE SETTING
THE PRESIDENT UP TO EMBARASS
HIM, TO HAVE KIM NOT SHOW WITH
THE PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE,
WOULD HAVE BEEN REAL
EMBARASSMENT TO THE UNITED
STATES AND A BLOW TO OUR FOREIGN
POLICY.
I AGREE 100% WITH CORY, THIS
PRESIDENT IS TRULY ENGAGED IN
TAKING ON THE MOST INTRACTABLE
PROBLEM WE FACE, THE MOST
DANGEROUS THING IN THE WORLD
TODAY, IS THE NORTH KOREAN
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY AND HE KNOWS
IT.
KIM KNOWS IT.
THE PRESIDENT KNOWS IT.
KIM NEEDS US.
I THINK EVENTUALLY WE WILL GET
SOME KIND OF DEAL BUT I THINK
THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT AT THIS
TIME TO CANCEL THE DEAL.
STEVE: AS YOU KNOW IN THE
BEGINNING WHEN THE SURPRISE DEAL
WAS STRUCK THERE WOULD BE A
SUMMIT.
MAINSTREAM MEDIA SAID, YOU KNOW,
THIS PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO GET
US INTO A NUCLEAR WAR, TALKING
ABOUT LITTLE "ROCKET MAN."
NOW HE CAN'T MAKE A DEAL.
NOW THE PRESIDENT SAID I'M
GETTING PLAYED, I'M OUT,
DEMOCRATS AND SOME OF THEIR
FRIENDS IN THE MEDIA, SUMMARIZED
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WAY.
>> THERE GOES THAT NOBEL PEACE
PRIZE.
>> SOUNDS LIKE A 13-YEAR-OLD
STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN
BREAKUP LETTER FROM OVERNIGHT
CAMP.
>> THE ART OF DIPLOMACY IS A LOT
HARDER THAN "THE ART OF THE
DEAL."
>> HE GOT TO LETTER FROM THE
PRESIDENT SAYING OKAY, NEVER
MIND, HE MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE
FIT RIGHT NOW IN NORTH KOREA.
>> PRESIDENT WAS REHEARSING END
ZONE DAMAGES AND WE WEREN'T AT
THE 50-YARD LINE.
>> THIS IS BREAKUP LETTER.
WHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP STARTS
SOURING YOU WANT TO BE ONE BREAK
UP FIRST, YOU CUT IT OFF.
WE LEAVE IT OPEN.
THAT IS WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE.
STEVE: JUST LIKE THAT.
COREY, AFTER THE PRESIDENT
PULLED THE PLAYING, THEY DIDN'T
THINK HE WAS GOING TO DO THAT.
WE'RE AVAILABLE ANYTIME.
>> MAXIMUM HARM CAMPAIGN THAT
THE UNITED STATES PUT ON
NORTH KOREA, THE ECONOMIC
SANCTIONS ARE PUTTING A
STRANGLEHOLD ON THAT ECONOMY,
THEY KNOW THEY CAN NOT SURVIVE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE THIS WITH
THE HELP OF CHINA AND THE HELP
OF OTHER WORLD LEADERS, TO SAY
WE HAVE TO DENUCLEARIZE THAT
PENINSULA.
IT IS TOO DANGEROUS.
WE CAN'T ALLOW KIM JONG-UN TO
HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
CONTINUE TO PROMULGATE, BY THE
WAY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION
TRIED TO GET THIS DONE, AND WE
COULDN'T.
WE SENT BOATLOADS OF LITERAL
CASH TO NORTH KOREA TO GET THEM
TO STOP THE NUCLEARIZATION
PROGRAM AND THEY DIDN'T.
WE'LL HAVE IT UNDER OUR TERMS.
BRIAN: THE MEETING IN CHINA AND
THAT MEETING IN THE CITY THAT
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, THAT
CHANGED THE -- THE PRESIDENT
BELIEVE CHINA DID THIS, THEY
TOLD HIM TO BACK OFF, SLOW DOWN,
IF CHINA IS PULLING THE STRINGS,
HOW DO YOU REACT, GERALDO?
>> NO DOUBT CHINA IS THE AGENT
THAT ENCOURAGED KIM TO SABOTAGE
THIS MEETING.
IT WAS ONLY AFTER KIM, WHO ONLY
TRAVELED ABROAD TWICE, BOTH
TIMES TO CHINA, ONLY AFTER HIS
MEETING, THE SECOND MEETING IN
CHINA EVERYTHING STARTED TO GO
SOUR.
I DO BELIEVE THE CHINESE ARE
DOUBLE DEALING.
PEOPLE HAVE TO RECALL, IF YOU
ARE MY AGE YOU REMEMBER THE
KOREAN WAR, WE HAD THE KOREAN
WAR WON AGAINST THE NORTH KOREAN
ARMY UNTIL THE CHINESE
INTERVENED MASSIVELY WITH THEIR
ARMY.
THE KOREAN WAR WAS NOT JUST THE
UNITED STATES AND ALLIES AND
UNITED NATIONS AGAINST
NORTH KOREA, WE WERE BASICALLY
FIGHTING CHINA.
CHINA STILL SEEMS TO ME PANICKED
THAT TRUMP OPENED UP THIS
POSSIBILITY OF A DENUCLEARIZED
NORTH KOREA.
THEY PANICKED.
THEY WANT TO IRRITANT IN THE
EYES OF THE WEST AND UNITED
STATES PARTICULARLY.
THEY WANT NORTH KOREA TO THE
ROGUE STATE SO THAT CHINA
APPEARS ONE REINS THEM IN.
I BELIEVE THE CHINESE PANICKED
WITH THE TIMING OF THIS MEETING
SABOTAGED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.
ENCOURAGED KIM TO PLAY THE
DOUBLE GAME.
STEVE: ALL RIGHT.
>> WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU BOTH
ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND MS-13.
THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT
THIS SO MUCH.
BRIAN GOT THAT EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW WITH HIM.
A MS-13 GANG MEMBER IS ACCUSED
OF KILLING AND BURNING THIS MAN.
HE CAME INTO OUR COUNTRY AS
UNACCOMPANIED MINOR.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> HE IS AN MALL.
THESE GANG MEMBERS HAVE NO
RIGHTS.
THE RICO STATUTES OR ANY OTHER
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY THAT
WE HAVE WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT
OF HOMELAND SECURITY, LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT, OUR STATE POLICE
HAVE TO CRACK DOWN ON WHAT
THEY'RE DOING.
AND LOOK, THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED
SUCH GRIEF FROM THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA FOR CALLING THESE PEOPLE
OUT FOR THE TERMS THEY USE,
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO RESPECT FOR
THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE.
WE'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME AND
TIME AGAIN AND THIS PRESIDENT
THROUGH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE HAS CRACKED DOWN ON
MS-13.
HE WAS OUT IN BETHPAGE JUST THE
OTHER DAY TALKING ABOUT THIS.
THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO BUT THE
FIRST PRESIDENT TO ACTUALLY TAKE
THIS ON AS A CAUSE TO MAKE OUR
COUNTRY SAFER.
STEVE: GERALDO, THE PRESIDENT
TOOK HEAT LAST WEEK HE WAS ASKED
A QUESTION BY A SHERIFF ABOUT
MS-13, HE CALLED THEM ANIMALS.
PEOPLE ARE GOING HE IS CALLING
ALL CRIMINALS ANIMALS.
THAT WAS WRONG, TAKEN OUT OF
CONTEXT.
>> I AGREE PRESIDENT WAS TAKEN
OUT OF CONTEXT.
I ONLY HEARD THE COMMENTS WHAT
THE PRESIDENT SAID.
I RESPONDED TO THE COMMENTS
ABOUT THE ANIMAL, I WAS AFRAID
HE WAS DEMONIZING ENTIRE CLASS
OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
HE WAS NOT AND I CLARIFIED MY
REMARKS.
SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT AINSLEY
ASKED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR
PERSON, WHAT I FEAR IS THAT HE
CAME AS UNACCOMPANIED MINOR,
GREW UP TO BE A GANGBANGER.
I HEAR PEOPLE MAKING ARGUMENT.
THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS, YOU CAN'T
CUT THEM ANY SLACK WHEN THEY
CROSS THE BORDER.
I URGE PEOPLE NOT TO THINK -- I
REMEMBER IN THE MIDDLE EAST
YOUNG PALESTINIANSIANS WERE
BEING KILLED, MOSTLY
INADVERTENTLY THE JUSTIFICATION
THEY WILL GROW UP TO BE
TERRORISTS.
THAT IS NOT THE WAY AMERICANS
THINK.
THE FACT THAT THIS ONE CHILD
GREW UP TO BE AN ANIMAL TO USE
COREY'S WORD, ACCORDING TO THE
PRESIDENT DOES NOT MEAN THAT
THESE CHILDREN COMING IN DON'T
DESERVE THE SAME COMPASSION AS
ANY OTHER REFUGEE, INNOCENT,
VULNERABLE.
IT IS OUR JOB TO HELP CRAFT OUR
SOCIETY TO KEEP THEM --
STEVE: YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE FROM MS-13 USE THAT
PARTICULAR LOOPHOLE IN OUR LAWS
TO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES.
>> I KNOW THAT MS-13 IS
MOTIVATED TO TRY TO CORRUPT
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, INTO
BECOMING CRIMINALS AND --
STEVE: SOME OF THEM ARE
CRIMINALS IN EL SALAVADOR.
>> WHEN YOU'RE 8-YEAR-OLD,
YOU'RE NOT A CRIMINAL.
I WANT A MEASURED, COMPREHENSIVE
APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION.
I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD
GET HIS WALL.
I URGE THE PRESIDENT TO SIMPLIFY
THIS DEBATE, GET THE DREAM ACT
KIDS, GIVE THEM THEIR ROUTE TO
CITIZENSHIP EVENTUALLY AND GET
THE WALL BEING FUNDED
$25 BILLION.
I THINK WE CAN MAKE THAT DEAL.
>>
BRIAN: LASTLY MITCH McCONNELL
SAID THERE WILL BE NOTHING DONE
BEFORE NOVEMBER.
WHO BENEFITS HAVING NOTHING DONE
FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS.
>> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY
ILLEGALLY.
WE ARE A SOVEREIGN NATION.
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A WALL
UP.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CONGRESS
DOESN'T FUND THIS.
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THEY
WERE FUNDING A BORDER FENCE.
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS MEMBER
OF THE UNITED STATES USED MONEY
FOR FUNDING THE BORDER FENCE
BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE CONTROL
OUR BORDERS.
WE NEED A BETTER IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM.
GET RID OF THE LOTTERY PROGRAM.
GET RID OF SANCTUARY CITY.
IT IS COMPREHENSIVE --
BRIAN: NO ONE IS DOING IT.
>> LOOK, THERE HAS TO BE ENOUGH
POLITICAL WILL OR ACCOUNTABLE AT
THE BALLOT BOX TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THING WE
DO AS A COUNTRY PROTECT OUR
CITIES FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN
DOMESTIC, STOPPING PEOPLE WHO
COME INTO THE COUNTRY TO KILL
IT.
>> WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR
LANGUAGE IS MEASURED.
THAT WE DON'T DENY THAT EVERY
SURVEY, EVERY RESEARCH, EVERY
POLL TAKEN SHOWS THIS
POPULATION, UNFORTUNATE THEY'RE
HERE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
ALL THE REST, MAYBE MANY OF THEM
SHOULD BE DEPORTED, BUT THE VAST
MAJORITY OF THEM ARE
LAW-ABIDING, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE
WHO ARE ONLY SEEKING THE
AMERICAN DREAM.
WE CAN'T FORGET THAT.
>> GERALDO SAID WE'LL TAKE
PEOPLE HERE THROUGH NO FAULT OF
THEIR OWN.
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO PLAY
POLITICS WITH THEM.
STEVE: ULTIMATELY GUY, CONGRESS
MAY HAVE TO STEP IN TO CHANGE
THE LAW.
BRIAN: CONGRESS HAS TO STEP UP.
STEVE: GREAT, SPIRITED DEBATE.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
