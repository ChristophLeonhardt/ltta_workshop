but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school understands that some</font>

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,049
parents wouldn't necessarily want there

33
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,689
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to study because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about sounds good dirt which is</font>

35
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,030
you know fine that's the way parents are

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,130
can be sent back so this the school sent

37
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,920
out a letter with like a slip saying

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,200
sign this consent form if you consent to

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
your child starting it that's absolutely

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine is that there are some people who</font>

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,979
actually went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really school board</font>

hadn't actually been cleared for bring

44
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,329
up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance saying that they don't</font>

45
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,890
agree that this book should be studying

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,869
at school because of its like

47
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,450
pornographic or rousing contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

48
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">very strong opinion about banning books</font>

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,299
as well like in not<font color="#CCCCCC"> balanced beginner</font>

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,219
stopping people from the game works when

51
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,829
we have the freedom to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> books I mean</font>

52
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,818
and secondly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a very strong</font>

53
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,229
feeling about this because this is

54

<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful book</font>

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,340
and also it's the fact that ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,590
understand how it slow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some</font>

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,210
parents might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no childhood it</font>

59
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,230
because you need some parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font>

60
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,080
that that's the way it is and it's rare

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,060
enough to give them the option to to say

62
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,140
whether or not they've won their child

63
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,050
to study it in class but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>
