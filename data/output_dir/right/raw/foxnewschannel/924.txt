1
00:00:00,513 --> 00:00:01,280
NOT THE FBI THAT I KNOW, THIS IS

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,050
NOT THE FBI THAT OUR COUNTRY

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,484
NEEDS.

4
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:05,551
CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL WITH

5
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,254
HIS REACTION IN MOMENTS, BUT

6
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:10,490
FIRST, FBI FORMER ASSISTANT

7
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,057
DIRECTOR DANNY COLSON.

8
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:13,092
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING, I

9
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:15,895
KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE

10
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,898
FBI, YOU HOLD NEAR AND DEAR TO

11
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:21,167
YOUR HEART.

12
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,402
LISTEN TO THE FALLOUT HERE.

13
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:25,671
>> THIS NEVER WAS AN FBI

14
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:26,706
INVESTIGATION.

15
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:28,274
THIS IS A JAMES COMEY

16
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:28,908
INVESTIGATION.

17
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:30,476
HE HIJACKED THAT INVESTIGATION,

18
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:33,379
TOOK IT AWAY FROM FBI AGENTS IN

19
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:35,848
THE FIELD AND THEY ARE NOT

20
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:37,550
INFLUENCED BY PRESSURE, FEAR OR

21
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:37,917
POLITICS.

22
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:39,452
TOOK HIM TO HIS OWN OFFICE AND

23
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:41,654
NEVER LET THE FBI DO IT.

24
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:43,556
THAT'S VERY DISTURBING TO ME

25
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:44,057
THAT HE DID THAT.

26
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:48,261
THE FBI IS INTACT.

27
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:49,429
CHRISTOPHER WRAY DID A

28
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,663
MAGNIFICENT JOB TODAY PUTTING

29
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:52,865
THIS THING IN PERSPECTIVE.

30
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:54,934
THIS WASN'T AN FBI DEAL, THIS

31
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:59,272
WAS A JAMES COMEY DEAL WITH HIS

32
00:00:59,272 --> 00:00:59,972
MINIONS THAT STOP TO INFLUENCE

33
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:02,875
AN INVESTIGATION.

34
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,645
>> WHAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND

35
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:08,314
WHEN AN EXCHANGE LIKE THIS

36
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:09,148
BETWEEN PETER STRZOK AND LISA

37
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:09,649
PAGE?

38
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:11,451
SHE SAID IN A TEXT MESSAGE,

39
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:13,286
TRUMP IS NOT EVER GOING TO

40
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,154
BECOME PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

41
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:18,257
RIGHT?

42
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:20,660
AND STRZOK SAYS, NO, HE IS NOT.

43
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,527
WE WILL STOP IT.

44
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:25,932
>> I THINK THEY DID STOP IT.

45
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:28,634
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANIMUS IN

46
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,503
THOSE EMAILS AND THE BIAS, AND

47
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:33,473
THEN WHAT THEY DIDN'T DO, HOW

48
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:36,142
THEY CONDUCTED THIS WEEK AND

49
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:36,676
EFFECTIVE SOPHOMORIC

50
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:38,111
INVESTIGATION, THEY DIDN'T USE A

51
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,680
GRAND JURY, AND IT WAS CONDUCTED

52
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,282
BY PEOPLE AT A MUCH TOO HIGH

53
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:43,683
LEVEL.

54
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,251
THEY SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE FBI

55
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,752
FIELD AGENTS TO DO THAT.

56
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,922
THEY ARE TOUGHER AND HARDER AND

57
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,891
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS.

58
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:54,193
>> Martha: THIS IS IN THE

59
00:01:54,193 --> 00:02:06,539
REPORT THAT CAME OUT TODAY.

60
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:20,186
THEY SAID THAT WE FOUND THAT ONE

61
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:20,853
OF THE REASONS FOR NOT USING

62
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:21,454
GRAND JURY FOR TESTIMONY

63
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:22,188
INVOLVED CONCERNS ABOUT EXPOSING

64
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:22,822
GRAND JURORS TO CLASSIFIED

65
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:23,222
INFORMATION.

66
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:23,890
HOW DOES NOT WASH WITH YOU?

67
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,390
>> IT'S LAUGHABLE.

68
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,124
I DID IRAN-CONTRA, THAT INVOLVED

69
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:25,825
A LOT OF CLASSIFIED MATERIALS.

70
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:26,559
THAT'S A SPECIOUS ARGUMENT, AND

71
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,260
I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THAT.

72
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,960
THEY ALL LAUGHED AT IT, ALSO.

73
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,262
THERE IS A PROCESS, MEGAN, TO DO

74
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:29,562
THAT.

75
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:31,764
>> Martha: IT'S MARTHA, BUT

76
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,633
THAT'S OKAY.

77
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:36,068
>> I'M SORRY, THERE IS A PROCESS

78
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:37,670
AND THEY DIDN'T DO IT.

79
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,971
>> Martha: IS ALSO REALLY

80
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:39,872
STUCK OUT TO ME.

81
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,340
IN TERMS OF THE INTERVIEW THAT

82
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,477
THEY DID WITH HILLARY CLINTON AT

83
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:46,679
THE VERY END, THE

84
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,481
INSPECTOR GENERAL SAID WE FOUND

85
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,484
THAT BY THE DATE OF HER

86
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,219
INTERVIEW, THE MIDYEAR TEAM AND

87
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,922
JAMES COMEY DID NOT CONCLUDE

88
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:57,023
THAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTED

89
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:59,325
CRIMINAL CHARGES.

90
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:01,294
AND IN PARENTHESES, ABSENT A A

91
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:02,895
CONFESSION OR FALSE STATEMENT,

92
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,697
AND THE INTERVIEW HAD LITTLE

93
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,499
OUTCOME ON THE INVESTIGATION,

94
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:08,201
HOW CAN THAT BE?

95
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,504
>> IT CAN'T BE, IT SHOULDN'T BE.

96
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:12,872
I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BIAS

97
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:13,172
HERE.

98
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:17,476
THEY WERE BIASED TO COME UP TO A

99
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:18,844
CONCLUSION, AND I DON'T KNOW THE

100
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,280
ANSWER TO THAT.

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,649
BUT I KNOW THAT, IT'S NOT OUR

102
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:28,421
JOB TO MAKE IT PROSECUTED

103
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,256
SOLUTION.

104
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:31,958
YOU DON'T FORMULATE YOUR

105
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,426
INVESTIGATION BASED ON A

106
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,194
PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF INNOCENCE

107
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:38,264
OR GUILT, THAT'S WHERE THE FBI

108
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:38,631
OPERATES.

109
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,665
>> Martha: I THINK IT'S

110
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,267
INTERESTING BECAUSE MOST OF THE

111
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,069
HEADLINES COMING OUT OF THIS,

112
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,470
BUT I ACTUALLY STARTED READING

113
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,274
IT, HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE

114
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,309
THAT TAKE AWAY REALLY CAME FROM.

115
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,577
BUT CHRISTOPHER WRAY SPOKE ABOUT

116
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:52,878
THIS TODAY, LET'S PUT OF THIS

117
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:54,180
CHART THAT'S PART OF THE REPORT

118
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,716
THAT SHOWS THE PATTERN OF LEAKS

119
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,117
COMING OUT OF THE FBI.

120
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:00,620
SO OBVIOUSLY AT HOME, YOU CAN'T

121
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,721
REALLY GRAB THIS COMPLETELY.

122
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,657
THE LITTLE RED CIRCLES IN THE

123
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:07,393
MIDDLE ARE REPORTERS, AND THERE

124
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:08,527
ARE NUMBERS THAT EXTEND OUT

125
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,496
SHOWING THE NUMBER OF EXCHANGES

126
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:13,499
BETWEEN THE REPORTER AND PEOPLE

127
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:16,235
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEPUTY

128
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,838
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, THE STEPP

129
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:20,039
OPERATIONS SPECIALIST, THE

130
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,940
GENERAL ATTORNEY, ALL GOING TO

131
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,908
THIS REPORTER PERSON IN THE

132
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,244
MIDDLE AND THERE ARE THREE

133
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:26,545
DIFFERENT CIRCLES THAT SHOW ALL

134
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,080
OF THE MYRIAD OF CONTACTS THAT

135
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,649
WERE HAD.

136
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:33,252
IS THIS THE FBI THAT YOU KNOW?

137
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:37,056
>> NO IT'S NOT.

138
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:40,126
WE HAVE MEDIA PEOPLE, AND THEY

139
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:41,761
ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE YOUR

140
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:44,096
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIA AND

141
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:45,431
NETWORKS, OR WHOEVER.

142
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:47,266
IT'S NOT THE JOB OF A THOUSAND

143
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,101
PEOPLE IN THE FBI TO TALK TO THE

144
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,871
MEDIA, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LEAKS.

145
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:53,005
I THINK CHRISTOPHER WRAY ADDRESS

146
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:53,706
THAT TODAY.

147
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:55,508
THEY WILL DO A STUDY TO SEE WHAT

148
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:55,975
THEY SHOULD DO.

149
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:57,710
WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IS GO BACK

150
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,712
TO WHAT WE DID.

151
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:02,315
DON'T TALK TO THEM.

152
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,115
>> Martha: I KNOW FBI AGENTS

153
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:04,917
THAT I TRY TO GET STUFF OUT OF

154
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,719
AND THEY DON'T TALK TO ME.

155
00:05:06,719 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT THERE ARE GOOD ONES OUT
