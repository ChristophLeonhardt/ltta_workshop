just a heads up that the House of Lords hasn't given up on its quest to stop brexit and neither have a number of members of parliament sorry I told you yesterday about the bill that's going through Parliament and is expected to go into a second reading on the 11th of May so that's week this week and that bill is talking about a second referendum and the referendum will be to decide on whether the people want the exit deal that's achieved or not which just brings up so many questions I mean first of all how many referendums Oh exactly are we going to have and who gets to decide when we finally got the right answer and secondly you know what what if what if the European Union know very well that if they give us a bad deal the British people will vote against the bad deal and then we'll just stay in the European Union I mean all these things that are being done in Parliament and how the House of Lords I have some Commons are being done to undermine our ability to negotiate properly with the European Union and this man at my opinion that we stopped negotiating at this point of bloody well leave but obviously what's being done here is trying to undermine our negotiating capabilities and there's a story here in the BBC brags it appears call for UK to remain in the European Economic Area hmm sounds a lot like the EEC when we first joined this whole thing it's just scaling it back a little bit and saying we're not technically in the EU kind of like Switzerland but really we are and the the article says the House of Lords has backed calls for the UK to effectively remain in the EU single market after brexit an amendment to the EU withdraw a bill abiding the UK to stay in the European Economic Area after it leaves the EU and 2019 was backed by 245 votes to 280 this was despite neither the government nor the Labour leadership backing it so what we're seeing here is that the House of Lords really is of being in itself it's neither labor nor Tory and it's certainly not democratic now here's the thing when I say it's not democratic I mean really what I'm really saying is it's not representing the will of the people and that's important it should do where I differ on some people is I don't think we should abolish the House of Lords I think we should return the House of Lords back to the days of the horrendous piers there is a bill going through Parliament this week as well which I mentioned yesterday that's aiming to get rid of all remaining hereditary fears which i think is scandalous and what I would like to see is a House of Lords that counterbalances the madness from the elected chamber in the House of Commons because there are some mental cases I mean Anna Supre MP who's a wall that she could quit the party if there was a heart brexit she says here and it's in the BBC article in a tweet Parliament is finally taking control brexit and is seeing off a minority of either ideologically driven heart breaks or tears well there are minority in the parliament but the non minority in the pub way by whatever name all devices are growing all party consensus in both houses to ensure UK retains benefits of single market in customs union after we leave the EU well I'm very sorry and a soupery but that's not the decision that the people made and when I see the the House of Commons packed to the rafters with full of these members of parliament who don't give a damn about what's you know what the general public are thinking it makes me think well if only we had hereditary peers who had historic links to the lands and the people they represent who are naturally a more conservative counterbalance to the madness that ends up in the House of Commons if only we had a hereditary House of Lords tackling this insanity then we wouldn't be having these problems not only would we not have a House of Lords voting against the Commons but we might have a house of laws that House of Lords that put amendments into the Eve with draw a bill that actually made it a better piece of legislation but nope for as long as we have a House of Lords that is packed full of business people of former former members of parliament and friends of the conservatives and labour party as long as that exists breaks it's not going to happen and this is a line that I'm increasingly becoming to believe is actually breaks it's not gonna happen not just because of the House of Lords messing it about but breaks it won't happen for as long as the European Union exists maybe we need to take down the entire European Union before we can even think about breaks it if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember download our app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and like and subscribe you
