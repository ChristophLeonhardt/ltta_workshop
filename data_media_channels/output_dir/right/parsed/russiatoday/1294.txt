tomorrow night Josie will get our first
glimpse of Renaldo yeah Portugal I know
in your predictions when you were making
them you said because of him
Portugal have a chance of winning this
World Cup why is he so important because
the best players in the world ik they
can make the difference I'm not saying
they make I'm saying they can make the
difference and everybody knows that
for the last decades Ronaldo and Messi
they were the two best players in in the
planet they did amazingly well for their
clubs they tried and of course
Portugal won it the euro but they try to
give the best of them to their countries
and I think they both arrived in this
World Cup probably as the last one you
think this is their last chance to win a
World Cup I don't see of course
Cristiano by the physical point of view
is is you know a Superman and it can if
he wants but four more years at the
highest level to come back to the next
World Cup I feel it I feel it hard
of course Donnell is is younger and he
can he can perfectly be in the next
World Cup in four years time but I would
also sync that to play every week to
three matches per week Barcelona Real
Madrid's La Liga champions league
national team I think to to resist to
all of that and four years later to come
at the highest level I think hard to so
I think they are going both to put
everything in this in this World Cup to
try to try to finish their careers with
the only thing that they don't have
because no one is is a world champion
and of course the the careers they
as club players to be what watch
champion being the pinnacle of their
career like a car makes the both of them
in actual fact we'll see ya Lionel Messi
