>> TRACE, NO QUESTION ABOUT
IT.
INCREDIBLE DRAMA.
IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR THAT
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN
STRUGGLING WITH WHAT HE
HEARD IN THAT EMOTIONAL
HEARING YESTERDAY FROM
PROFESSOR CHRISTINE BLASEY
FORD AND JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS
BREATHED A HUGE SIGH OF
RELIEF THIS MORNING WHEN
FLAKE SAID HE WOULD BE A YES
ON THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION.
HE SAID OUR SYSTEM OF
JUSTICE AFFORDS THE
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENT TO
THE ACCUSED ABSENT
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE.
DEMOCRATS APPEALED TO HIM
FOR ONE WEEK DELAY TO HAVE
THE FBI LOOK INTO THE
ALLEGATIONS.
I THINK 2 WOULD BE PROPER TO
DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE FOR UP
TO BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE
WEEK IN ORDER TO LET THE FBI
CONTINUE TO DO AN
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN
TIME AND SCOPE TO THE
CURRENT ALLEGES THAT ARE
THERE AND LIMIT IN TIME TO
NO MORE THAN ONE WEEK, I
WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE
BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT
UNDERSTANDING.
>> SENATOR COONS AND SENATOR
FLAKE HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER ON THIS.
THIS WAS KIND OF A SURPRISE
TO ALL OF US.
SENATOR FLAKE HAS EXPRESSED,
INCLUDING IN HIS SPEECH
YESTERDAY, HIS CONCERN ABOUT
THE DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY
THAT IS BEING EXACERBATED BY
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVE BEEN
ASKING OVER AND OVER AGAIN
FOR FOLLOW-UP THE JUDGE
BRETT KAVANAUGH NOMINATION
WAS REPORTED OUT OF THE
COMMITTEE 11 TO 10 ALONG
PARTY LINES.
JEFF FLAKE WANTS MORE TIME.
A NUMBER OF HIS COLLEAGUES
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL THINK
THAT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD
IDEA.
TRACE?
>> YEAH.
ALL THE ATTENTION RIGHT NOW
IS FOCUSED ON YOUNG SENATOR
FLAKE, MIKE.
BUT THERE ARE OTHER KEY
SENATORS TO WATCH.
>> ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
ASSUMING SENATOR FLAKE STAYS
A YES ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH,
THERE ARE REALLY FOUR KEY
SENATORS TO WATCH VERY
CLOSELY.
REPUBLICAN SUSAN COLLINS OF
MAINE AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF
ALASKA AND DEMOCRATS FROM
CONSERVATIVE STATES HEIDI
HEITKAMP OF NORTH DAKOTA AND
JOE MANCHIN OF WEST
VIRGINIA.
MANCHIN SAID MOMENTS AGO HE
SUPPORTS A DELAY.
THIS CALL FOR DELAY HAS LEFT
SOME SENIOR REPUBLICANS
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS.
>> ALL I CAN SAY IS RIGHT
NOW WHAT JEFF IS SAYING IS
MAKES SENSE TO ME.
I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR MITCH.
I'M GOING TO TALK WITH JEFF.
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO EXPLAIN
THIS TO TRUMP.
I GUESS THAT WILL BE MY JOB.
>> SOME SOURCES CLOSE TO
THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS
THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH IN
THE LAST FEW MINUTES SAY
THIS COULD BE A BLESSING IN
DISGUISE IF IT GIVES SOME OF
THOSE MODERATE SENATORS SOME
COVER BY SAYING THE FBI
LOOKED INTO THE ALLEGATIONS
AND THEN IT WOULD BE TIME TO
VOTE.
TRACE?
>> YOU KNOW, MIKE, WE
THOUGHT THIS WEEKEND WAS
GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT KIND
OF LOBBYING.
THE LOBBYING EFFORT.
NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ON
THE BACK BURNER.
WHAT'S THE PATH MOVING
FORWARD?
>> EVERYBODY ON CAPITOL HILL
ALL EYES ON THE SENATE
MAJORITY LEADER.
HE WAS PLANNING PROCEDURAL
VOTES OVER THE WEEKEND AND
FLOOR ACTION MONDAY AND
TUESDAY HOPING TO CONFIRM
JUDGE KAVANAUGH BY TUESDAY.
IF HE NEEDS HELP IN GETTING
TO 50 VOTES, IT WOULD SEEM
MCCONNELL WOULD ALLOW A ONE
WEEK DELAY BUT THIS ENTIRE
PROCESS IS REALLY NOW IN THE
HANDS OF MCCONNELL AND THE
GUY DOWN THE STREET,
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
TRACE?
>> YEAH, I JUST WANT TO FLAG
YOU TO THIS, MIKE, BECAUSE
WE JUST GOT AN URGENT SAYING
THAT SENATE G.O.P. LEADERS
ARE MEETING WITH FLAKE AND
GRASSLEY AND OTHER JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT HOW
TO PROCEED ON KAVANAUGH.
THAT'S A KEY MEETING GOING
ON SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOMS
BEHIND YOU.
>> YEAH ONE WOULD ASSUME,
THEY WOULD SAY FINE, BUT
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAD THIS
DRAG ON WEEK AFTER WEEK
AFTER WEEK.
SOME SOURCES I HAVE TALKED
TO CLOSE TO THE PROCESS SAY
THEY ARE OKAY WITH A LITTLE
MORE TIME IF IT ALLOWS THE
FBI TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE
STUFF AND ALLOWS SOME OF
THESE MODERATE SENATORS TO
GET TO YES, TO GET HIM
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.
