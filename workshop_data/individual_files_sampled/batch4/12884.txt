the news media is saying the death of four soldiers in Niger may be Donald Trump's Benghazi and Ghazi you'll remember was when Hillary Clinton convinced Barack Obama to assist in the overthrow of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya which led to Libya becoming a failed state and a haven for terrorists during which process our ambassador repeatedly begged for increased security and was ignored by Hillary's State Department so that finally terrorists staged a coordinated attack on our compound in Benghazi and murdered four Americans including our ambassador after which Obama and Clinton both lied repeatedly to the American public by blaming the attack on a Christian video maker in order to protect Obama's run for re-election by hiding the administration's fatal incompetence and malfeasance in the Middle East incompetence and malfeasance that were then minimized and even covered up by the news media which is now saying that Niger is trumps Benghazi because it's exactly like all that except for the fact that it's not like any of that in any way Trump's Benghazi comes hard on the heels of the Hurricanes in Puerto Rico which the news media told us was Trump's Katrina Katrina was that when the news media managed to successfully blame a New Orleans disaster on george w bush who had sent nearly two billion dollars in public work funds to louisiana which corrupt Democrat politicians then rerouted two useless pork barrel projects instead of projects that would have protected New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina so I guess Berto Rico was Trump's Katrina in the sense that the news media tried to blame Trump for the fact the Trump sent Puerto Rico plenty of emergency supplies but the Puerto Ricans couldn't distribute them properly Trump's Benghazi and Trump's Katrina of course only occurred after Trump's Watergate which was the scandal about Trump colluding with the Russians to hack the election which was only different from Watergate in the fact that Trump never colluded with the Russians and the Russians never hacked the election I'm sure we can now look forward to Trump's IRS scandal Trump's Fast and Furious scandal Trump's Valerie Plame affair and Trump's iran-contra and all the other Trump versions of the Democrats scandals the media tried to suppress and the Republican non scandals that the media tried to turn into scandals by the time we're finished we should probably get to Trump's affair with Sally Hemings Trump's fiddling while Rome burned and Trump's disobeying God in the Garden of Eden precipitating the fall of man either that whether the public will finally begin to catch on that the people who masquerade as mainstream journalists in this country are really nothing but Democrat operatives with press cards at that point that Donald Trump administration could turn out to be the news media's Waterloo trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and you can listen to the Andrew Clavin show Monday through Thursday right here at the Daily wire
