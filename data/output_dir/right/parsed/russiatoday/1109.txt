fans coming here for World Cup 2018 have
sacrificed some have saved for months
even years to get to Russia others have
been sacked from jobs because their
bosses didn't give them the time off
money is tight such a thousand and one
stories so that's why I've been set the
task to see as much as I can here in
beautiful Samara eat and drink for 20
euro more or less that is the equivalent
of this around 1500 rubles let's see I
can do it our first stop today is a
cultural one a very busy one to July the
issues of people waiting to go in from
here to the bunker of Stalin built an
idea 42
it's where the Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin would have gone event
less than 30 years ago Samara was a
closed city to I'd savage due to the
important part of late in the Soviet
space program but now I've heard five
hundred and fifty rubles you can get as
stellar as you like and learn all the
secrets there are to know at the space
capital museum it's time to do it I'm
afraid the first selfie of the trip now
as any football fan knows you have to
refuse to be in top shape for all the
games and here in Samara there is a
surprisingly huge array of different
cuisines I'm gonna try one that's been
recommended to me who's Beck food
so this really is the perfect pit stop
for a traveler on a budget I'm getting
great to eat a meat and rice dish called
sloth I've had it before it is excellent
let's try this
okay we've come across some Aneta
clicking Denmark founds here we're gonna
ask them in a word what their experience
is in russia 2018 husband hi guys I am
exciting amazing some more guys right
here less than Malacca hello what's your
dream sweet friendly it's pretty good
all right
some guys get any times here inside in
one word but it's been really nice
very nice that sounds good I'm finally
hello sir
so we've seen just some of what this
city has to offer a football fan on
their downtime we've seen some great
sights
we've beaten some good food I've got a
couple of euro left in my pocket so what
else is there to do go find a drink
and we fund it on it's no ordinary we're
either is the pride of Samara
if you may thank you very much
you
