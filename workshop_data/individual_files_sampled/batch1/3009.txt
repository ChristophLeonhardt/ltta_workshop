one year ago Alison Chantal is a senior at Syracuse University when an email landed in her box it was Google granting her a chance to interview for a job at the Googleplex her heart went wild this was a dream come true so Alison welcome first we're glad to have you as an employee I'm glad to get everything didn't work out ultimately so so tell us what happened you're at Syracuse you get this email go yeah they had a couple of marketing reps come in and speak to a bunch of the students I was in the advertising Newhouse School there so the marketing school and the Newhouse School got together and we looked into Google Talk they said here's what you should do to apply you know the interview process is rigorous they did warn us and so me and a bunch of my friends were like hey Google we want to work there let's go for it that's how she is free fool I was chanting google tech sounds amazing yeah I was like oh I can surf on my lunch break sounds great I'll be pick California so I put together a really nice resume worked on my cover letter like crazy set it in and I got an inbox from Google okay two interviews next week four different jobs same job same job is just back-to-back interviews there was for a product manager position so what happened so we set up everything I had my first interview at 4 o'clock and then I had 15 minutes in between a break it was about 30 minutes 45 minute interviews and the first interview was pretty smooth for the most part for the first half just basic questions like hey how are you what do you want to do with your life try to relax you a little right and then they went in for the kill which was well the first kill was from my interviewer Oliver and it was the question about how much money do you think we make from Gmail ads every day and there's just so many unknowns to a question like that I mean you can there's just so many and I did research but come up with an exact number which seemed to be at the end of the day what he was getting after was really intense now you were interviewing for a marketing job right so one wouldn't need to think one need to be a rocket scientist to be in marketing right and I mean I had a read that Google does these brain teasers and he even warned me hey these they're gonna test your analytical skills and they're gonna sound kind of crazy but yeah you never really think this is just freakishly smart I mean radiating genius through the phone well I think he was just as nervous as I was I could tell that he wasn't quite comfortable with the interview just interviewing in general because he had to ask questions like this an actually funny story I met him a year later at the mix conference and I confronted him about it and I said hey that's how much money do you make from Gmail ads every day and he looked at me he looked at my nametag and was taken aback and goes I'm so sorry I honestly don't know there we go that made me feel a lot better it's really funny and the second interview the first of all interesting that you would have two interviews for the same job back-to-back anyway second one the second one was actually more intense than the first I am I had a woman and she rapidly started firing things off at me like hey you've got this product what do you do with it give me an ad creative right away boom boom so I had to really think on my feet and then math math I've always had a better writer than a mathematician so when she started firing questions I mean I just sort of got frazzled and that was that now the amazingly to me is that you and your friends knew about this Google hazing technique yeah so you actually prepared and there was one question in particularly prepared which was well there's the age-old question that Google seems to ask about if you're placing a blender and you've got 15 seconds before the police start raining what are you gonna do so my natural reaction would be to scream for help but that's a bunch of different options you can choose such as John Gordy hello here's what you do you take off your pants you take off your shirt you pick my parachute you press yourself against the wall and when the blade starts spinning throw it up you will be projected out of the blender instant so next time you're doing a goola goola review you'll know what to say that's funny I was gonna say that if you ever go granola into a blender you'll see what happens puffs right out so you don't be the granola interesting anyway Alison it's a great recounting of this I'm sure you would have helped legions of college seniors are going to go through this Elish process so we thank you very much for sharing the story thanks
