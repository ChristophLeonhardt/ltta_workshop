dinesh d'souza has continued his press tour and he is giving interviews to multiple shows on CNN talking about how Trump has given him a full pardon of his convicted crime and my favorite interview was the one done by Alison cammarata on new day I don't want to say anymore just take a look at the first clip he basically said he wanted you to be a bigger voice than ever defending the principles that you believe in and so I want to just go through here what those principles are February 2015 you tweeted about President Obama and there are people here racist overtones here you can take the boy out of the ghetto you say watch this vulgar man show his stuff while America towers in embarrassment you had another tweet in 2010 about President Obama's father you say this philandering inebriated African socialist is what you call him oh sorry that's from a Forbes magazine so I'm confused what are the principles that you are hoping to be able to talk about now and spread well Alison first of all I'd be happy to talk about those two tweets Obama's father was a philandering inebriated African hold on are you are you anti philandering look I'm not talking about this I I was referring to Obama's book Dreams from My Father your principal are you anti philandering are you anti Bulgaria T in your first one philandering is not a principal what I was saying is that is that Obama claims himself that he derived his dreams his principles from his father okay that was one of the best things I've seen on cable news so Alison Cammarata comes with a two-by-four love it that's how you're supposed to do an interview whether it's a Republican or Democrat doesn't matter cuz servidor a liberal doesn't matter be tough challenge your guests and and call him out now if you're wondering why Dinesh was so uncomfortable and taking it back and got awkward is it because Donald Trump has also famously Philander yes and by the way Obama didn't do the philandering he claims his father did okay what his father has to do with Obama no one knows I don't know why he brought that up other than to call him an African socialist and to smear him over all right but there's one other part of this story Dinesh D'Souza went to jail for illegal campaign contributions by the way he confessed to that crime and said that it was not a setup that he did do it as it was in his plea deal okay and he would go to prison at a jail at night and and serve that sentence now one of the people that he illegally funneled the money through was his mistress so he got his both his wife and his mistress to illegally give money to his friend who was running for a political position yeah it appears he is not anti philandering flattering yes well philandering is not a principal apparently not Dinesh yeah but there's more there's more this was such a great interview let's take a look at the next video the very idea that you can define me by a tweet or two over a long careers purpose for trying to define you but I am trying to figure out what your principles are and they seem confusing because you are obviously a sequela president Trump's and the idea that you would go after President Obama's father for philandering and for being vulgar that's direct sum is hypocritical why aren't you speaking out about president Trump's philandering why aren't you speaking about out about his vulgarity well look my argument about Obama wasn't about philandering Obama is not a philanderer his father was but Obama wasn't and so why did you bring that up there and now he says of course now that Trump's got the pardon in why camerado bringing it brought up in the first place is it has freedom to go talk about his really important principles yes and so one of the principles apparently was that Obama was debasing the White House because he took a selfie that was that was the grave crime that Obama was charged with but okay so we all know we're now in the Trump era we have seen also so he has shown himself to be quite vulgar in various situations he has referred to NFL players who decide to kneel in protest sons of bitches just to give you an example he says he likes to grab women by the pussy I don't like to censor that word because that is the exact word that he used okay that is vulgar right but in the next clip he continues to criticize Obama over the selfie stick it's not a sleazy attack on an individual it's an examination of ideas okay but when you call sage to somebody you can take the boy out of the ghetto it is a sleazy attack on an individual well you look here's here's Obama in the White House and he's got this selfie stick and he's running around looking in the mirror and making ridiculous faces that's why we graded the porn yeah go ahead that's you find that more degrading then things that you've heard in the past year in terms of vulgarity coming from the White House look we're looking and we're liking that was wonderfully embarrassing okay well I'm glad he's there to spread those incredible ideas out to everybody remember selfies are bad where Trump is doing and ridiculous faces have you seen Donald Trump oh hey I got big strong words and a big strong face and Obama was making faces come on two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube
