“My name is Bradley Cooper,
and I co-wrote and directed
“A Star Is Born.”
So we’re at the
beginning of the movie
now where the two
characters just met,
and this scene is
really the anchor
for the rest of the film.
If as a filmmaker
I don’t securely
plant the audience
in these two
people and their relationship,
then the rest of the movie
won’t work.
When I first went to
Hollywood and met some people
that were really famous, and
I remember going out with them
in the night.
And their access to stuff
is always very interesting.
But the other
thing that always
blew me away is to see
somebody like that in a pizza
place at 4:00 in the
morning with regular people,
or at a grocery store.
You’re like, oh, they
go to these places too.
I always found that
very thrilling.
And this, I wanted to feel
like you’re in real time,
almost, with these people.
That was the only way I could
get my head around the fact
that you would actually
believe that they’re
falling in love,
is that you need
to see these moments
sort of broken down
into three things.
One is the first visual
look that two people have.
And then there’s
the tactile moment.
And then it’s revealing
their souls to each other.
And in my life, having met
people and fallen in love,
it usually happens
when you feel
as if someone’s
seeing you in a way
that no one else
is seeing you.
And this is the scene where
she’s seeing him in a way.
And the movie’s showing you
him take in that knowledge.”
“(SINGING) Tell
me something, boy.
Aren’t you tired trying
to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain’t it hard keeping
it so hardcore?”
“Is that me?”
“That’s you.”
“You just write that now?”
“Yeah.”
“It’s pretty good.”
“Her, from the very
beginning of the movie,
the movie knows she’s a
star before she does it.
And the movie’s almost
searching for her.
And with this scene, when she
stands up and starts singing,
the camera’s over her
shoulder looking down at him.”
“(SINGING) I’m off the deep
end, watch as I dive in.
I’ll never meet the ground.”
“So she’s in this
empty lot at 4:00
in the morning in the
outskirts of Los Angeles,
and Jackson Maine, this
very well-regarded musician,
is one of her fans,
almost like a boy.
So I really love that shot of
him just looking up at her.”
“(SINGING) — shallow now.”
“And what was
great about when we
found that location was it
functioned as almost a stage.
There’s all those
lights behind her,
as if she’s up on a huge stage
at Coachella or something
without even realizing it.”
“I think you might
be a songwriter.”
