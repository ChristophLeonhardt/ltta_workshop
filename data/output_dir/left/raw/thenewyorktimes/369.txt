00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:01,650
The iPhone.

3
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,460
Released in 2007, Apple's
smartphone has become ingrained

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,090
in our day-to-day lives.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,550
From allowing us to access
a search engine at the tap

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,010
of a finger to offering us an
entire keyboard full of emojis,

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,650
it seems like the iPhone
has created a lot of new

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,480
possibilities.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,740
But it's also destroyed things.

00:00:23,225 --> 00:01:30,870


12
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,280
You could say the iPhone is
an equal opportunity destroyer

13
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,060
and spares not even itself.

14
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,030


15
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,730
One thing the iPhone
hasn't destroyed--

16
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,290
our desire for more.
