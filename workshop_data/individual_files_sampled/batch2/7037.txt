Patrick Harmon was a fifty year old black man living in Utah in Salt Lake City originally a st. Louis native as you'll see in some of our coverage in this story and he was acting a little bit erratically he was on his bicycle and cops pulled him over people wonder why there's a black lives matter movement why players in the NFL are protesting systemic police abuse well this is part of the reason why now I'm gonna show you a video here if you're queasy this is not the video to watch if you care about what's actually happening in America then you got to see this but here the warning is very specific here the man you're gonna see here Patrick Harmon is in the last minutes of his life the last seconds of his life and I want you to pay attention to when he runs away and what happens because I'm gonna read you afterwards what the police claimed happened and how they said it was incredibly clear that Harmon was about to threaten their life but you're gonna see the actual video for yourself with your own eyes here so here's what happened Patrick you know you already know about your okay okay I I believe that but I need you to take your backpack off me okay they take your backpack off for me if you jam too much fire start medical I got him look I don't know a little part of that videos more haunting uh you know when you start watching you know he's gonna be dead within 30 seconds when he's shot and bleeding out and they handcuff him anyway they already took the backpack off they already knew he had no weapons but nope that's not what the police say so let me tell you how it went down here on Wednesday as CNN reports after a seven-week investigation the Salt Lake County District Attorney concluded the officers use of deadly force was justified because the officers said they feared Harmon was going to hurt them according to a letter the district attorney sent to the Salt Lake County Sheriff and the city's police chief detailing his investigation into the incident you just saw the video there's no other video there's no other evidence so they say no he that guy as he was running away put them in mortal danger they thought they were gonna die any second from Harmon and that's why they had to shoot him in the back and then officials look at him go oh yeah absolutely that's right justified you wonder why people are angry alright I'll give you more details of their excuses Harmon was stopped by a police officer on the evening of August 13th after he wrote a bicycle across six lanes and a median according to a narrative laid out by the district attorney's SEM Gill Harmon was required to have a red rear taillight on his bicycle to officer told me oh I didn't know he was that dangerous he was missing a red rear taillight on his embosser Co and that's why they had to shoot him four times in the back because he was such a big danger now look was he acting erratically yes going across those lanes and going across the median it turns out he had mental health issues if I saw a guy doing that I'd say whoa that's dangerous let me make sure I pull them over that makes sense I don't know Salt Lake City has people who can help with mental health issues all police departments should some do San Antonio does and they have do a great job with it right and I would call that person for help but what I think this guy's on the precipice of killing me with his missing taillight on his bicycle I'm not sure that's the conclusion I would reach Fox and that was the officer of shot him later told investigators that his Harmon was running away he stopped and turned back to his officers with a knife in his hand yelling I laugh and stab you you saw the video there is no other video so they said no no no yet perfectly clear he was clearly running back towards the officers the officers were about to die they saw the knife and then they had to shoot him is that the video you saw go back and we watch it officer Fox said he feared if he didn't immediately use deadly force mr. Harmon was going to stab him and or the other officers well if that's what they saw it certainly wasn't clear cuz that is not what the rest of us saw so if you slowed down the video maybe you see him looking back maybe you could make a claisen case that as he was running away he turned around a little bit I don't know where the knife is they claim it's clear that the knife's in the video you go back slow it down as much as you like and watch the video again no no in their version and this is what's the unbelievable part it was clear that the guy running away who was shot in the back four times was about to kill the police officers and you wonder why people are angry and you wonder why they protest that's why they protests cuz that's not what happened we could all see it with our eyes it's not remotely what happened now I told you as a st. Louis native our TYT politics reporter Jordan Chariton is in st. Louis covering the protests and he actually caught up with antoinette harmon who is a sister and i want to show you a piece of that interview it's just a bunch of bull what they said I just um believe anything they said because first of all if he had a knife in a gun they would have been released this camcorder footage and to receive it last week it was just it was it was hard to watch you know it hurt me real bad and then they say they shot him in the torso they don't covered this in an investigation of so much it really it's not fair then for them to justify the police killing my brother and they put her tonight what you see in the video I did not see him with the knife they say you slow the video down you can see a knife know that steady get him a reason to shoot my brother run it and they covered it up so much they say it's horse sorry he was shot from the back I mean really they really I didn't get no information from my brother until last week then they just sent me a police report and it's not complete because their pianist took over so let's break it down a little bit further it's not what she said so first of all the cops tell you don't believe your lying eyes there was a knife okay let's grant him for a second that there was a knife he's 50 years old all the officers are in much better shape and much younger so if he turned around in that in that half a second they had no choice but to shoot him four times they couldn't pause they couldn't stop they couldn't hold their guns and say drop your weapon if he had one they couldn't do any of that they only had one choice put four bullets in him immediately that's why I say the police training is wrong because they trained him kill him and don't worry about it we'll get you off later and it's true they do get him off later every time shot him in the torso I would love to see an actual medical examiner to see if those bolts enter the front of the back because our eyes seem to indicate that they entered from the back and so they just keep asking us to believe things that are not believable for God's sake have some decency and if he's got mental health issues just pause for a second before you kill him dead and then handcuff him as he bleeds out where's the humanity but they train the humanity out of them they say no no it's okay if there's even a slight doubt something might look like a knife for half a second just kill the guy and be done with it that's not what police who serve the entire community are supposed to do all right more from his sister we need to be here they need to change laws they really need to do something about these police's first of all it's a lot of people that has mental illness problems homelessness it don't give them the right these are people they are important to educate them help them don't kill them don't take their life because you have a gun really you get another chance to go to court we need we need more places to help people that because my brother's here he was bipolar schizophrenic so that's not a that's not shouldn't be a death sentence oh look I told you about San Antonio before if you actually train officers the right way and you give them the help that they need you know what happens the number of people with mental health issues who were killed at San Antonio by cops is way way lower than the rest of the country why cuz they actually bother to train the cops right so they serve the community these things are fixable instead of fixing them what do they do they cover it up and go okay well I was in danger for a half a second so I just killed a guy who cares I mean I say who cares and you say well I don't know you you know do you know that who cares yeah I do I saw the video yes I know I look I sometimes think okay what would I I mean and I hope you think this too and this is to be fair to the police what would you do in that situation the guy's running away its erratic could you mean in some degree for sure he could be in some degree if here you got to chase him down I guess that's a hassle yeah you know I hope you can do that he turns around for a house would you really shoot him you're like you're not sure if he's holding anything you're you're and and he was just crying a second ago he's already taken off his backpack he looks like he might have some mental health issues you would have murdered him you want to kill him I hope to god you would enough and I hope to god we can train our police better than that sorry they've been trained this protocol we've seen it because we see enough of these videos once the once the person is on the ground bleeding to death I'll be fast they always keep guns on them that's a training technique they always cut them that's a training technique how come they remember those all the time it's because those are taught to them so when you should have got in the back apparently that's okay as long as you're afraid that you're gonna be embarrassed when you go back to the precinct and your fellow officers say yeah I got away from you didn't you oh you're a loser you're afraid of that is what you're afraid of so then after all this goes on also if you had a knife he was halfway cuffed he had one arm behind his back and was approaching the second you didn't check for weapons yet I felt that's the police protocol - why would you cuff someone why would you even begin to cover a suspect that has weapons on them you just messed up before that - so your your training is all off none of these stories can flip all these stories conflict nothing to make any sense to go with your normal protocol it's all made up and they know the main thing they know is if you mess up you can kill someone we will cover for you no matter what say what happened even though it wasn't what happened say what happened will believe you will say it was perfectly plausible it doesn't make any sense all right we're gonna give the last word to a sister Antoinette Hartmann you could watch the whole video on youtube.com slash tyt politics Jordan did a great job of interviewing her but here she is Patrick was a beautiful person he had a good heart he was a family person that was more of a protector he met my children and myself he he was a family guy he loved his family he won perfect he loved life and he loved to enjoy it to the fullest before they took it from him and he was only 50 right it was 50 he would've been 51 tomorrow tomorrow's his birthday a birthday he's not gonna have it's not that folks in this country are protesting too much they're not protesting
