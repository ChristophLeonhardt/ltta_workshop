AINSLEY: NATIONAL SECURITY

00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:03,628
ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON JOINS US

3
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:07,799
LIFE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,401
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

5
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:10,102
CONGRATULATIONS ON NEW POST.

6
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:11,837
>> THANK YOU.

7
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:12,471
AINSLEY: ASIDE FROM THEY

8
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,672
WILL BURNING THE AMERICAN

9
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:15,807
FLAG AND YELLING DEATH TO

10
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,741
AMERICA, WHY WAS THIS

11
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,375
DECISION SO IMPORTANT.

12
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,810
>> LOOK, IT'S NO SURPRISE

13
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,878
IRAN DOESN'T WANT TO CHANGE

14
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,646
ANYTHING IN THE EXISTING

15
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,581
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WHY

16
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,281
SHOULD THEY?

17
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,917
THEY GOT A WONDERFUL DEAL

18
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:26,751
FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE.

19
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,553
IN FACT, THEIR ONLY REGRET,

20
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:29,354
I DON'T THINK THEY DIDN'T

21
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:31,056
ASK OBAMA AND KERRY FOR MORE

22
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:31,890
BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY WOULD

23
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,524
HAVE GOTTEN IT.

24
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:33,892
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT

25
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:36,061
FOCUSED ON WHY THE DEAL WAS

26
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,596
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN HIS

27
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:39,131
REMARKS YESTERDAY.

28
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:41,733
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, IT WAS

29
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:42,734
NOT IN AMERICA'S STRATEGIC

30
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,603
INTEREST TO ENTER THE DEAL

31
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,971
AND NOT IN OUR STRATEGIC

32
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,105
INTEREST TO STAY IN THE

33
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:47,405
DEAL.

34
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:48,140
WE'RE OUT OF IT.

35
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,407
WE ARE GOING TO REIMPOSE

36
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,675
SANCTIONS TO THE MAXIMUM

37
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,376
EXTENT POSSIBLE.

38
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:52,744
WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH OUR

39
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:53,512
EUROPEAN ALLIES.

40
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,380
WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER

41
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,515
OTHER OBJECTIONABLE ASPECTS

42
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,517
OF IRAN'S BEHAVIOR AND TRY

43
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,152
TO REDUCE THIS THREAT IN THE

44
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:03,355
REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD.

45
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,322
PETE: SIR, HAVE

46
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:04,355
PETE: SIR, PAVE

47
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:04,388
PETE: SIR, PROE

48
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:05,056
PETE: SIR, PROBABLY SAW SOME

49
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:05,824
OF THE REACTION FROM

50
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,092
DEMOCRATS WHO THINK A LITTLE

51
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:07,993
BIT DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT

52
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,628
THE DEAL -- THE DEAL USED TO

53
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:10,996
REPRESENT AND WHAT THIS MOVE

54
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,597
MEANS NOW HERE IS WHAT A FEW

55
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:13,398
DEMOCRATS SAID YESTERDAY.

56
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,100
WE ARE GOING TO PUT IT UP ON

57
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,433
SCREEN.

58
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:15,967
BARACK OBAMA FORMER

59
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,936
PRESIDENT SAID IT RISKS

60
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,037
ERODING AMERICA'S

61
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,437
CREDIBILITY.

62
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:22,140
NANCY PELOSI SAID IT

63
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,941
ENDANGERS GLOBAL SECURITY

64
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,943
AND DEFIES COMPREHENSION.

65
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:28,246
JOHN KERRY'S GOING BEHIND

66
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:28,914
THIS ADMINISTRATION'S BACK

67
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:29,948
AND TALKING TORE COUNTRIES

68
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,483
SAYS IT BREAKS AMERICA'S

69
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:32,217
WORD.

70
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,286
MAKES A NUCLEAR IRAN MORE

71
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,253
LIKELY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

72
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:36,655
THESE CRITICS?

73
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:39,491
>> 180 DEGREES WRONG.

74
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:40,825
THIS DEAL WAS GIVING IRAN

75
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:43,161
COVER TO GET TO THE

76
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:47,265
OBJECTIVE FOR DECADES WHICH

77
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,300
WAS MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

78
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,434
IT WAS CONCEIVED WITH THE

79
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:50,468
WRONG VIEW OF CONSEQUENCES

80
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:51,469
FOR THE UNITED STATES AND

81
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,770
IRAN.

82
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,805
I MEAN, REALLY, IT RESTED ON

83
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,207
THE NOTION IF WE COULD JUST

84
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,075
RESOLVE THE NUCLEAR PROBLEM,

85
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,943
IRAN'S BEHAVIOR WOULD CHANGE

86
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:58,443
FOR THE BETTER.

87
00:01:58,443 --> 00:01:59,511
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE HAS

88
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,046
TAKEN PLACE.

89
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,214
IRAN'S BEHAVIOR HAS GOTTEN

90
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:02,547
WORSE.

91
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:04,616
IT'S BEEN MORE BELLIGERENT,

92
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:05,450
MORE SUPPORTIVE OF TERRORISM

93
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,718
AS WE CAN SEE FROM WHAT THEY

94
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,154
ARE DOING RIGHT NOW IN IRAQ

95
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:09,955
AND SYRIA.

96
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:10,689
STEVE: RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

97
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:11,923
HEARD AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO

98
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,824
ASK YOU TO COMMENT ON IT

99
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:13,758
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DON'T

100
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,493
WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE

101
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:16,161
PRESIDENT, BUT MIKE POMPEO

102
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,898
IS IN NORTH KOREA AND IT IS

103
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:20,932
EXPECTED HE IS GOING TO BE

104
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,967
TRAVELING BACK VERY SHORTLY.

105
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,235
COULD HAVE SOME SURPRISES

106
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:24,402
BUT, SIR, A NUMBER OF

107
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:26,304
DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID THE

108
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:27,739
MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA IS

109
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:28,974
YOU CAN'T TRUST THE UNITED

110
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:29,307
STATES.

111
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,309
WE HAD A DEAL WITH IRAN AND

112
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,978
THEY CAN'T TRUST US AND

113
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:35,247
NEITHER SHOULD THE NORTH

114
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:35,580
KOREANS.

115
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,448
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO THE

116
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,315
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE SAYING

117
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:37,616
THAT?

118
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,817
>> THEY ARE COMPLETELY

119
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:39,117
WRONG.

120
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,452
WE HAD A ROTTEN DEAL WITH

121
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:40,752
IRAN.

122
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:43,321
AND JUST AS GEORGE W. BUSH

123
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,890
WITHDREW FROM THE 1972 ABM

124
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,492
TREATY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN

125
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,059
AMERICA'S STRATEGIC

126
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:48,426
INTEREST.

127
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,060
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT

128
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,628
HAS DONE HERE.

129
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,429
I THINK IT SENDS A VERY

130
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:52,964
IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO NORTH

131
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,265
KOREA.

132
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:54,866
WE'RE NOT IN THESE

133
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:55,800
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM JUST

134
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,968
TO GET A DEAL.

135
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,936
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE RIGHT

136
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:58,236
DEAL.

137
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,304
AND WITH RESPECT TO NORTH

138
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,272
KOREA, WE'RE GOING TO ASK

139
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:01,539
THAT THEY DO WHAT THEY

140
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,541
AGREED TO DO OVER 25 YEARS

141
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:03,808
AGO.

142
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,144
WHICH IS NOT ONLY NOT PURSUE

143
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,846
NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT GIVE UP

144
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,514
URANIUM ENRICHMENT AND

145
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:10,248
POLLUTE REPROCESSING.

146
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,449
THE BACK END AND THE FRONT

147
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:12,884
END OF THE NUCLEAR FUEL

148
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:13,184
CYCLE.

149
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:14,753
THAT WAS THE EUROPEAN

150
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:15,954
POSITION WITH RESPECT TO

151
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,122
IRAN BACK IN THE DAY.

152
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,556
AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO

153
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:22,527
TAKE A LOOK AT.

154
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:24,529
SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE TO

155
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,164
THESE NATIONS.

156
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,468
>> THE SAMTIONS TAKE EFFECT

157
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:30,869
IMMEDIATELY.

158
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,103
THERE IS NO NEW BUSINESS

159
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,004
ALLOWED UNDER THE TERMS

160
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,572
PRESCRIBED FOR EXISTING

161
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:35,907
CONTRACTS THEY THERE ARE

162
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:36,708
WIND DOWN PROVISIONS THAT

163
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,876
COME INTO EFFECT AND

164
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:38,576
TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND

165
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:39,511
OTHERS WILL BE LAYING THOSE

166
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,314
OUT IN MORE DETAIL.

167
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:46,217
OBVIOUSLY OUR SANCTIONS HAVE

168
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,385
ENORMOUS EFFECTED ON

169
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,586
LICENSES ALREADY.

170
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,921
IF F. AMERICAN COMPANIES

171
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,089
CAN'T USE THOSE LICENSES TO

172
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:51,790
SELL TO IRAN.

173
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,657
NEITHER IS ANYBODY ELSE.

174
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:53,591
WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING

175
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,526
TO THE EUROPEANS.

176
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,727
IN FACT, WHEN I LEAF HERE,

177
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:57,662
I'M

178
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:57,696
-M

179
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,597
--LEAVE HERE I'M GOING TO BE

180
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:00,832
DOING A CONFERENCE WITH

181
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:03,268
BRITAIN, FRANCE AND GERMANY

182
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:06,204
TO WORK FORWARD ON.

183
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,672
SO IDEAS PRESIDENT MACRON OF

184
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:08,340
FRANCE HAS BEEN TALKING

185
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,640
ABOUT.

186
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,075
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO.

187
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,509
WE SHARE THE COMMON

188
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,876
OBJECTIVE.

189
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,511
WE DON'T WANT IRAN WITH

190
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:15,246
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

191
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:16,147
PETE: AS SECURITY ADVISOR

192
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,882
HAVE YOU FRONT ROW SEAT.

193
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:19,884
THE SCRAPPING IRAN DEAL TO

194
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,519
THE PROSPECTS OF A SIT DOWN

195
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,154
IN NORTH KOREA AND THEN THE

196
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:24,189
MOVING OF THE EMBASSY FROM

197
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,757
TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM.

198
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:27,992
WHAT IS IT ABOUT, AS HAVE

199
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:28,927
YOU WATCHED THIS PRESIDENT,

200
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,428
WHAT IS THE TRUMP DOCTRINE?

201
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:31,996
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS

202
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,031
APPROACH THAT HAS CREATED

203
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:33,865
THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND

204
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:34,199
CHANGES?

205
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,700
>> WELL, I THINK THE

206
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,168
PRESIDENT FOLLOWS THE ADVICE

207
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,671
OF HARRY TRUMAN AND DEAN

208
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,139
APPEARENSON THAT HE

209
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,207
NEGOTIATES FROM POSITIONS OF

210
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:43,641
STRENGTH AND NOT POSITIONS

211
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:44,409
OF WEAKNESS.

212
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,944
HE BELIEVES IN PEACE THROUGH

213
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,311
STRENGTH.

214
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:47,278
WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING, HE

215
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:48,213
CARRIES THROUGH ON IT I

216
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:49,647
THINK THAT'S WHERE THE REAL

217
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:50,749
CREDIBILITY COMES FROM.

218
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,217
NOT FROM EXECUTING DEALS

219
00:04:52,217 --> 00:04:53,585
THAT DON'T ACCOMPLISH WHAT

220
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,486
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO.

221
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:55,954
SO, I THINK THAT'S ONE

222
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:59,023
REASON HE IS VERY OPTIMISTIC

223
00:04:59,023 --> 00:04:59,924
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

224
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,228
MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN.

225
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:03,895
STEVE: MR. BOLTON, WHAT DO

226
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:04,796
YOU SAY TO DEMOCRATS THAT

227
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:05,697
ARE UPSET THAT THE PRESIDENT

228
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:06,898
PULLED THE PLUG ON THIS,

229
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:09,033
EVEN THOUGH A NUMBER OF

230
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:09,634
THEM, INCLUDING CHUCK

231
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,069
SCHUMER BACK A COUPLE YEARS

232
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,539
AGO VOTED AGAINST BARACK

233
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,542
OBAMA'S IRAN NUKE PACKET.

234
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,244
>> THEY WERE RIGHT THE FIRST

235
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:19,544
TIME.

236
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:21,980
IT WAS A MISTAKE WHEN IT WAS

237
00:05:21,980 --> 00:00:00,000
FIRST AGREED TO AND IT
