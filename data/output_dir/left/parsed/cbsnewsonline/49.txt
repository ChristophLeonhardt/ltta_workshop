REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD SAY, 
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO BE GONE. 
YOU TO BE OUT OF HERE. 
>> ROSENSTEIN SAYS THAT'S NOT 
THE CASE. 
>> HE DENIES IT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT, AS THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE CERTAINLY HAS THE 
RIGHT TO FIRE ROD ROSENSTEIN, 
PARTICULARLY IF HE CAN FIRE HIM 
FOR CAUSE. 
IF IN FACT HE DID SAY HE WAS 
CONSIDERING TAPING THE 
PRESIDENT, AND IT WAS NOT 
SOMETHING SAID IN JEST, WHICH 
BY THE WAY, EVEN SAID IN JEST, 
THAT'S A FOOLISH THING TO DO, 
THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS 
THAT IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR 
CAUSE, AND NOW BEFORE WE GO TOO 
FAR AFIELD, WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN MAY BE 
WALKING OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND NOT NECESSARILY GOING INTO  
ACTUALLY RESIGN. 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET. 
AXIOS HAS REPORTED IT, BUT WE 
DON'T KNOW IT'S YET CONFIRMED. 
WE WILL WAIT AND SEE. 
PAULA REID IS WORKING ON IT 
RIGHT NOW, AND THE REALITY, 
TOO, REMEMBER, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS RIGHT NOW, DOWN THE STREET 
FROM WHERE WE ARE. 
HE IS IN NEW YORK. 
SO, IF ROD ROSENSTEIN IS GOING 
OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE, I 
ASSUME HE'S GOING OVER TO SPEAK 
WITH JOHN KELLY AS THE CHIEF OF 
STAFF, AND A LOT OF TIMES, 
THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS, BUT 
ULTIMATELY WHY WOULDN'T ROD 
ROSENSTEIN WAIT TO BE FIRED? 
WHY RESIGN? 
>> YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING -- 
>> WHAT IS THE TOONS THAT 
QUESTION? 
>> I DON'T HAVE THE FAINTEST 
IDEA. 
I WOULD WAIT TO BE FIRED, BUT 
JUST LIKE PREEK WAS THE ONE 
U.S. ATTORNEY WHO SAID COME AND 
GET ME. 
>> I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION 
PEOPLE WILL HAVE, HOW OFTEN 
DOES THE PRESIDENT SAY THE NEW 
YORK TIMES IS FAKE, PHONY 
SOURCES, AND IT'S NOT TRUTHFUL, 
YET IF HE'S GOING BY THE 
REPORTING IN THE NEW YORK TIMES 
THAT RECOMMENDS ITSELF TO THE 
IDEA THAT THE MEDIA AND THE 
PRESS IS ONLY VIABLE TO THE 
ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT SUITS 
ITS INTEREST. 
IF IT DOESN'T, IT'S FAKE NEWS. 
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS, HE SAYS 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND THEN, WHY 
WOULD THE PRESIDENT, IN THIS 
PARTICULAR CASE, BELIEVE THE 
NEW YORK TIMES, AND IN ALL THE 
OTHER INSTANCES OF THE NEW YORK 
TIMES REPORTING SAY FAKE NEWS? 
>> WHAT A RATIONAL ASSESSMENT, 
VLAD. 
THE REALITY IS THAT THOSE OF 
US, PERHAPS INCLUDING THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
WHO DECIDE TO READ ALL OF WHAT 
A NEWS REPORT OR ARTICLE SAYS 
BELIEVING NONE OF IT, ALL OF 
IT, OR SOME OF IT. 
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IT 
CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE THE 
INITIAL STORY FROM THE NEW YORK 
TIMES HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY 
VERY MANY OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS, 
BUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU SAY 
SOMETHING IN JEST, OR WHETHER 
OR NOT YOU WERE SERIOUS, AND 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISPUTE 
AMONGST THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, 
ABOUT WHAT ROD ROSENSTEIN 
ACTUALLY SAID AND WHAT HE MEANT 
WHEN HE SAID IT, AND KEEP IN 
MIND THE PERSON WHO WROTE THE 
MEMO ABOUT WHAT WAS SAID IN THE 
ROOM WAS ANDREW McCABE. 
HE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN LET 
GO, AND HE'S UNDER 
INVESTIGATION. 
YOU A LOT OF THINGS UNDERNEATH 
THIS, AND THE DIFFICULTY, I 
THINK, THAT PEOPLE FEEL IS 
THIS. 
IF YOU'RE ROD ROSENSTEIN, WOULD 
YOU AVOID THE CONSTITUTION 
CRISIS BY GOING FORWARD AND 
RESIGNING, CREATE THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS? 
I SAY THAT IN QUOTES, BY MAKING 
THE PRESIDENT FIRE YOU WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT HAS THE RIGHT TO FIRE 
YOU FOR CAUSE. 
WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE FALLOUT, 
WHAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT IS THE INVESTIGATION OF 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT 
MUELLER, IF ROBERT ROSENSTEIN 
GOES, DOES THAT MEAN MUELLER IS 
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AND THE 
INVESTIGATION WILL CLOSE DOWN? 
THAT'S FIVE STEPS DOWN THE 
ROAD, AND SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BE 
PUT IN ROD ROSENSTEIN'S PLACE, 
AND THAT PERSON WOULD CERTAINLY 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO LET ROBERT 
MUELLER FINISH HIS 
INVESTIGATION, AND ONE WOULD 
THINK IT WOULD BE DONE FAIRLY 
SOON. 
I THINK THE ONLY END POINT WE 
CAN LOOK AT RIGHT NOW, IT IS 
SAID THAT MICHAEL FLYNN WILL 
GET SENTENCED ON DECEMBER 18, 
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS AT 
LEAST OPEN UNTIL DECEMBER 18th, 
AND THAT'S A LONG TIME FROM 
NOW. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> SO IF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL IS FIRED OR IF HE 
RESIGNS, WHO, THEN, BECOMES 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ROBERT MUELLER, 
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> AS I UNDERSTAND IT, AND I 
WILL CONTINUE TO RESEARCH IT. 
AS I UNDERSTAND, THERE'S NO 
DIRECT LINE OF SUCCESSION THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO FOLLOW 
HERE. 
I THINK THAT BECAUSE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL SESSIONS HAS RECUSED 
HIMSELF. 
>> THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE, 
RIGHT? 
>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT TO OUR 
VIEWERS. 
THE REASON WHY THE DEPUTY A.G. 
IS IN CHARGE, NORMALLY IT'S THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
>> NO QUESTION. 
>> AND BECAUSE JEFF SESSIONS 
RECUSED HIMSELF, IT FELL INTO 
ROSENSTEIN'S LAP? 
>> EXACTLY. 
NORMALLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
IS LOOKING TO APPOINT DEPUTIES. 
I DON'T WANT TO HOLD FAST UNTIL 
I RESEARCH THOROUGHLY, BUT THE 
PRESIDENT DOES HAVE A RIGHT TO 
APPOINT SOMEONE TO BE IN THE 
POSITION AS I UNDERSTAND IT. 
IF THAT IS, IN DEED, CORRECT, 
THERE'S A MYRIAD OF CHOICES 
HERE. 
>> DOES THE PERSON APPOINTED 
HAVE TO BE PART OF THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
>> WHAT I READ QUICKLY ON MY 
WAY FLYING DOWN THE STAIRS 
HERE, IS THAT THE PERSON MUST 
HAVE ALREADY BEEN CONFIRMED. 
>> WHOA. 
>> SO THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP OF 
PEOPLE WHO FALL INTO THAT 
CATEGORY. 
AS WE CONTINUE, I WILL CONTINUE 
TO RESEARCH, AND AT THE SAME 
TIME, PAULA REID IS GOING OFF 
TO DO A SPECIAL REPORT THAT 
WILL BE ON THE AIR, AND SHE IS 
PROBABLY GOING TO RESEARCH THIS 
HAS WELL. 
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, AND THIS 
IS ALL AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF 
WHAT IS PLAYING OUT IN THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE, WITH THE 
PRESIDENT, AND YOU HEARD 
EARLIER THIS MORNING, AND 
MAKING HIS WAY TO THE U.N. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, STICKING HARD 
AND FAST WITH HIS NOMINEE FOR 
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. 
IT'S ALL PLAYING OUT AGAINST 
THAT AND THE FACT YOU HAVE, YOU 
KNOW, EVERY WORLD LEADER HERE 
IN NEW YORK CITY FOR A SERIES 
OF MEETINGS AT THE UNITED 
NATIONS, AND THERE'S A LOT 
GOING ON, AND IT'S HARD, TO ME, 
AND AGAIN, AS SOMEONE WHO IS 
NOT IN POLITICS, IF YOU'RE JUST 
THE AVERAGE PERSON ON THE 
STREET, YOU'RE WATCHING WHAT IS 
HAPPENING HERE, AND YOU'RE 
SAYING, EVEN IF THE PRESIDENT 
IS JUSTIFIED IN GETTING RID OF 
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, IS 
THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT? 
>> WELL, THAT IS A REALLY GOOD 
QUESTION BECAUSE OF THE LOOMING 
MIDTERMS, AND SO IS THIS THE 
RIGHT TIME? 
>>> IS SAYING, LOOK, SESSIONS 
COULD BE IN TROUBLE AFTER THE 
MIDTERMS, DEPENDING HOW IT ALL 
PLAYS OUT, AND YOU WOULD ASSUME 
IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ON 
THE CHOPPING BLOCK, PERHAPS THE 
DEPUTY A.G., AND THE PRESIDENT 
JUST CLEANS HOUSE AFTER THE 
MIDTERMS. 
WHY MAKE THE MOVE NOW? 
>> THAT MAY BE A VERY TRUE 
STATEMENT, BUT, IF IT'S BROUGHT 
ABOUT BY ROD ROSENSTEIN WALKING 
TO THE WHITE Hâ– OUSE, IF IT'S 
THOUGHT BECAUSE HE'S WALK 
TOGETHER WHITE HOUSE, IN FACT 
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE 
CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN KELLY, 
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
RESIGNATION, RATHER THAN THE 
FACT OF RESIGNATION, THIS IS A 
FACTOR THAT OF ALL PEOPLE, JOHN 
KELLY HAS TO TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION IN A CALCULUS, 
AND IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT, OR 
IS IT BY DESIGN THAT ROD 
ROSENSTEIN WOULD WAKE UP ON 
MONDAY MORNING, MAKING THE TREK 
TO TALK TO JOHN KELLY F THAT  
-- IF THAT IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING, WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
IS ENGAGED IN THE U.N. GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY. 
IN THE WORLD OF FOREIGN POLICY, 
WE HAVE TO WATCH WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS ULTIMATELY GOING 
TO SAY TO THE LEADERS OF THE 
OTHER FOREIGN NATIONS. 
IT'S AN ODD TIME, OR IS IT? 
>> PERHAPS NOT. 
>> WE HEARD THAT THE PRESIDENT, 
DESPITE HIS SORT OF SIGNATURE 
LINE, YOU'RE FIRED FROM HIS 
SHOW, IN FACT DOES NOT LIKE 
FIRING PEOPLE, SO WHY NOT GET 
SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT WHILE 
YOU'RE OUT OF TOWN? 
THAT'S SIMPLISTIC. 
>> BUT WHEN YOU STARTED WITH ME 
WHEN I TOOK THE CHAIR JUST NOW 
IS REALLY THE VERY IMPORTANT 
CONSIDERATION. 
IF YOU HAVE THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, WHETHER OR NOT HE'S IN 
CHARGE OF THE INVESTIGATION, 
IT'S A POWERFUL POSITION, AND 
IF HE WAS IN FACT TALKING ABOUT 
THE 25th AMENDMENT, LET ALONE 
THE FACT OF TAPING THE 
PRESIDENT, THAT CERTAINLY GIVES 
REASON TO SAY IT'S FOR CAUSE. 
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN 
ROSENSTEIN SAYING TO McCABE, 
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, WEAR 
A WIRE. 
THAT'S VERY SARCASTIC. 
HE HAS A QUIRKY PERSONALITY, 
AND IT WOULD NOT BE UNHEARD OF 
IN HOW HE INTERACTS WITH 
PEOPLE, BUT IT'S A DANGEROUS 
THING TO DO. 
>> SO THERE'S AN INTERVIEW THAT 
THE PRESIDENT DID WITH HERALDO 
RIVERA OF FOX NEWS, AND HE 
ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT ROD 
ROSENSTEIN AND THE REPORTING IN 
THE NEW YORK TIMES, AND THE 
PRESIDENT BASICALLY SORT OF 
DIDN'T GIVE AWAY HIS CARDS, AND 
HE ESSENTIALLY SAID HE HASN'T 
HEARD EVERYTHING YET, HE'S 
WEIGHING WHAT TO DO, AND HE 
POINTS OUT HE WAS HIRED BY JEFF 
SESSIONS, AND JEFF SESSIONS 
RECUSED HIMSELF. 
HE'S BEEN ACTIVE ON TWITTER, 
AND HE CALLED OUT ROSENSTEIN 
AND OTHERS, HE CALLS OUT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE ON TWITTER, AND 
SOMETIMES NOTHING HAPPENS 
BECAUSE OF THE TWEETS HE 
LAUNCHES. 
AS YOU SAID, RIKKI, WE DON'T 
KNOW. 
WE ARE SPECULATING IF HE'S 
RESIGNING, WILL BE FIRED OR THE 
COMBINATION OF YOU'RE FIRED, 
AND YOU CAN'T FIRE ME, BECAUSE 
I QUIT. 
>> JUST READING WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY IN 
RESPONSE TO THE ARTICLE, IT'S 
VAGUE, BUT HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, 
WELL, I THINK IT'S A VERY SAD 
STORY, AND PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY 
LOOKING INTO THE IT. 
IT'S VERY SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS 
 
HAPPEN. 
SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE 
STORY OR THE CONTENT OF THE 
STORY. 
THAT'S HIM ACKNOWLEDGING HE 
BELIEVES THE CONTENT OF THE 
STORY IS TRUTHFUL. 
>> ALSO, THE PRESIDENT'S USUAL 
WORDS ARE, WE WILL SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS. 
>> THAT IS HIS FAVORITE CLOSING 
LINE. 
>> AGAIN, LOOK, WE ARE STILL 
TRYING TO LOCK THIS DOWN, AND 
WE ARE GOING TO KNOW VERY, VERY 
SOON. 
AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING, THE 
DEPUTY A.G. 
IS ON HIS WAY TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
WHILE WE ARE SORT OF TRYING TO 
NAIL THIS DOWN, LET'S TALK A 
LITTLE THE BIT ABOUT THIS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH NOMINEE SITUATION, 
AND IT IS PLAYING OUT AGAINST 
ALL OF THE BACKDROP OF WHAT WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, AND CAN 
WE, YOU KNOW, CAN -- JUST, WITH 
YOUR EXPERIENCE, RIKKI, DO YOU 
THINK THE HEARING IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN ON THURSDAY? 
>> AS THE PRESENT SECOND, YES, 
BUT ASK ME AT 3:00 OR 4:00. 
THE KAVANAUGH SITUATION RIGHT 
NOW IS FOUGHT WITH PERIL. 
THERE'S A SECOND ACCUSER, AND 
MICHAEL AVENATTI SAYS HE HAS A 
THIRD ACCUSER, AND HE WILL 
ANNOUNCE THAT. 
MICHAEL AVENATTI AS HE PUTS IT 
AND PUT IT ON TWITTER, ONCE 
AGAIN, HE DOESN'T BLUFF. 
>> WE SAID THAT EARLIER, WE 
KNOW HE LIKES TO BE ON 
TELEVISION, AND HE'S ON THE AIR 
HERE QUITE OFTEN AS WELL AS 
OTHER PEOPLE'S BROADCASTS, BUT 
HE'S NEVER NOT PRODUCED WHAT HE 
SAYS HE HAS. 
>> ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, AND WE 
KNOW THAT HE HAS A THIRD 
ACCUSER. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, EXCEPT THAT IT 
WAS, AGAIN, WHEN BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WAS YOUNG. 
WHETHER HE WAS A TEENAGER OR IN 
COLLEGE, WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY, 
BUT IN THAT YOUTHFUL TIME, AND 
THE DIFFICULTY IS THIS. 
THIS HAS TO WEIGH HEAVILY NOT 
ONLY ON BRETT KAVANAUGH, BUT IT 
ALSO HAS TO WEAR HEAVILY ON 
DONALD TRUMP AND THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 
CHARGE OF GOING FORWARD AND 
HELPING BRETT KAVANAUGH THROUGH 
THE HEARINGS, AND THERE COMES A 
POINT WHERE SOMEBODY HAS TO 
MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF IF IT'S 
WORTH ALL OF THIS. 
THERE'S A LIST THAT THE FEDERAL 
SOCIETY, A CONSERVATIVE GROUP 
PUT TOGETHER FOR PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP, OF MANY, MANY 
WELL-QUALIFIED WHO ARE 
CONSERVATIVES. 
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO START AGAIN 
FOR A SEARCH. 
HE HAS THE NAMES FOR A SEARCH. 
HE HAS TALKED TO PEOPLE AT THE 
TIME OF THE NEIL GORSUCH 
NOMINATION, AND AGAIN AT THE 
TIME OF THE KAVANAUGH 
NOMINATION, AND THERE ARE OTHER 
PEOPLE THAT HE COULD QUICKLY 
PUT INTO BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
CHOOSES AND HAVE THEM GO FORTH 
AS A NOMINEE. 
NOW, WHAT THIS CREATES, 
OBVIOUSLY, IS THE PROBLEM THAT 
IF THERE IS A NEW NOMINEE, 
THEN, DO YOU KNOW -- HOW LONG 
DOES THE CLOCK GET STALLED? 
MANY OF THE PERSPECTIVE 
NOMINEES, IN FACT, IF NOT ALL, 
ARE ALREADY JUDGES ON UNITED 
STATES COURTS WHO HAVE GONE 
THROUGH CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, 
AND ALL THEIR FILE HAS TO DO IS 
BE UPDATED. 
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE TO START 
FROM SCRATCH HERE. 
THE DEMOCRAT-REPUBLICAN 
DILEMMA, THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
DELAY UNTIL AFTER THE NOVEMBER 
ELECTIONS, AND THE REPUBLICANS 
WOULD LIKE TO MARCH FORWARD, 
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE 
REPUBLICANS MARCHING FORWARD, 
MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN 
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR, HE WANTS THE 
VOTE, AND THAT IS, WILL THIS 
PERSON, THIS JUSTICE, BE 
TAINTED FOREVER MORE AS THE -- 
POSSIBLE, THAT'S POSSIBLE, 
ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULTER AND 
SOMEONE WHO HAD, YOU KNOW, AN 
INAPPROPRIATE BACKGROUND WHEN 
THEY WERE A TEENAGER, EVEN 
THOUGH THEY HAVE HAD DECADES OF 
SERVICE. 
CLARENCE THOMAS HAS BEEN ON THE 
COURT ALL THE TIME, AND FOR 
MANY PEOPLE,ESPECIALLY OF A 
CONSERVATIVE BACKGROUND, THEY 
FEEL HE IS A VERY, VERY 
EFFECTIVE JURIST. 
>> WHAT HE DID HAVE WAS AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
ACCUSATIONS. 
>> VERY, VERY FAIR ENOUGH. 
>> IT'S DIFFERENT TIMES, AND WE 
ARE HYPERSENSITIVE TO HOW 
POLITICAL THINGS HAVE GOTTEN, 
AND YOU KNOW, JUST READING SORT 
OF THE PORTION OF THE HERALDO 
INTERVIEW, AND THE PRESIDENT IS 
ASKED, AND HE ASSERTS SUPPORT 
FOR KAVANAUGH, BUT HE SAYS DR. 
FORD WILL HAVE TIME TO TELL HER 
STORY, AND HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, 
WE WILL LISTEN TO BRETT, AND WE 
WILL LISTEN TO DR. FORD, AND HE 
SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE THE 
WAY YOU HAVE TO VOTE AS A 
REPUBLICAN AND AS A DEMOCRAT, 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT 
PORTION OF THE INTERVIEW, BUT 
THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT IS 
GOING TO BE FOLLOWING HIM, IF 
HE BECOMES A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE, THAT PART OF IT IS IT 
DIDN'T MATTER WHAT CAME UP. 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WILL 
ONLY VOTE A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE 
IT'S VERY POLITICALLY CHARGED 
TIMES. 
>> TELL THAT TO SENATOR 
COLLINS, AND TELL THAT TO THE 
SENATORS THIS IS A VERY THIN 
MAJORITY IN THE SENATE AT THIS 
POINT IN TIME. 
WHETHER YOU HAVE -- ONE OF THE 
THINGS AS I HAVE ASSESSED, 
SPEND YEARS PROSECUTING 
SEXUALLY ASSAULT CASES AND SENT 
ON THE BOARD OF THE RAPE 
TREATMENT CENTER OF UCLA LOS 
ANGELES FOR 7 YEARS, IS THAT 
WHEN DR. FORD FROM NEWS 
ACCOUNTS, BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT 
HEARD HER, DR. FORD SOUNDS 
LIKE, TO ME, A CREDIBLE 
INDIVIDUAL, AND SHE CERTAINLY 
BELIEVES EVERYTHING SHE SAYS IS 
TRUE, THAT SHE HAS PASSED A 
POLYGRAPH FROM A FORMER FBI 
EXAMINER, AND THAT THERE ARE 
THINGS IN HER LIFE THAT 
CORROBORATE HER STORY, HER 
LEAVING THE EAST COAST FOR THE 
WEST COAST, HER DECIDING TO 
BECOME SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH 
PEOPLE IN TRAUMA, AND HER 
DIFFICULTIES IN EXPRESSING ALL 
OF THIS, AND HER DECIDING TO 
TELL HER HUSBAND AND THE 
THERAPIST IN 2012, LONG BEFORE, 
AND THIS IS DURING OBAMA'S 
TIME. 
LONG BEFORE BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS 
A NAME THAT EVER CAME OUT TO 
THE PUBLIC. 
YOU A LOT EVEN THOUGH NO ONE 
ELSE WAS IN THE ROOM EXCEPT 
MARK JUDGE, WHO IS NOT 
TESTIFYING BECAUSE THE SENATE 
DECIDED NOT TO CALL HIM, THE 
THIRD GUY IN THE ROOM, AND EVEN 
THAT IS CREDIBILITY THAT SHE 
NAMES A THIRD PERSON IN THE 
ROOM. 
YOU A POTENTIALLY CREDIBLE 
STORY. 
SHE COULD FALL APART ON 
THURSDAY IF THERE'S A STORY, 
BUT NOW YOU WONDER, WHY AREN'T 
THERE MORE? 
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE HAVING. 
>> WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT 
PLAYS OUT. 
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, 
BUT THE NEWS ROCKING THE 
POLITICAL WORLD RIGHT NOW IS 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD 
ROSENSTEIN IS ON HIS WAY TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
EARLY REPORTS WERE HE VERBALLY 
RESIGNED TO CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN 
KELLY, AND NOW THAT HIS 
REPORTING IS HE EXPECTS TO BE 
FIRED. 
THE PRESIDENT IS HERE IN NEW 
YORK CITY, AND ROSENSTEIN IS ON 
HIS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND 
BE RIGHT BACK. 
STAY WITH US. 
>>> WINDS ARE FEROCIOUS, 
GUSTING OVER 120 MILES AN HOUR. 
>> THE ISLAND IS STILL 
STRUGGLING TO RECOVER. 
MANY ARE WONDERING IF IT EVER 
WILL. 
PUERTO RICO IS IN THE THROES OF 
LOSING ITS MOST VALUABLE 
RESOURCE, ITS PEOPLE. 
>> Reporter: THE SIGN OF THE 
PEOPLE EXITING IS THE NUMBER OF 
SCHOOLS SHUT DOWN OVER THE 
ISLAND. 
>> THE MAGNITUDE OF MARIA IS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY HARD 
TO PLAN FOR. 
>> I WILL DIE TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE PUERTO RICO IS A PLACE 
WHERE WE CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITY. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, IF YOU ARE JUST 
JOINING US, THERE'S REPORTS, 
AND WE STRESS THE REPORTS THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS 
VERBALLY RESIGNED TO WHITE 
HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN 
KELLY IN ANTICIPATION OF BEING 
FIRED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
CBS NEWS HAS NOT CONFIRMED 
THIS, BUT A SOURCE SAYS 
ROSENSTEIN, AS POINTED OUT, IS 
ON HIS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
RIGHT NOW. 
THAT LIVE SHOT IS THE ENTRANCE 
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> WHERE WE EXPECT HIM TO WALK 
IN WHEN HE ARRIVES. 
>> ROSENSTEIN OVERSEES THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE 2016 ELECTION, AND 
AXIOS CITES A CLOSE SOURCE TO 
HIM WHO SAYS HE IS EXPECTING TO 
BE FIRED, AND THE SOURCE TOLD 
CBS NEWS HE IS HEADED TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. 
>> WE HAVE RIKKI KLIEMAN, AND 
CAITLYN HUEY BURNS. 
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESIGNING 
AND BEING FIRED. 
>> IT'S A DISTINCTION WE KEEP A 
CLOSE EYE ON. 
IF ROSENSTEIN RESIGNS THAT WILL 
LET THE PRESIDENT APPOINT 
SOMEONE TO FILL THE POSITION. 
IF HE'S FIRED, IT'S OUR 
UNDERSTANDING THE NATURAL 
SUCCESSION PROCESS TAKES PLACE. 
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE, 
REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT DOES 
NOT LIKE THIS INVESTIGATION TO 
SAY THE LEAST, AND THERE HAVE 
BEEN MANY QUESTIONS IF HE WOULD 
SESSIONS IN ORDER TO END THE 
MUELLER PROBE, AND FIRING 
ROSENSTEIN COULD SET THAT INTO 
EFFECT BECAUSE ROSENSTEIN, OF 
COURSE, OVERSEES THE MULLER 
PROBE, AND THERE'S A QUESTION 
IF HE WOULD APPOINT SOMEONE IN 
THERE TO DO HIS BIDDING AS IT 
RELATES TO THE INVESTIGATION. 
ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE, AFTER 
WE FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY IS 
GOING ON HERE, IF ROSENSTEIN IS 
OUT, WHAT IT PROMPTS LAWMAKERS 
IN CONGRESS TO DO IN THE 
SENATE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 
LEADING UP TO ALL OF THIS, WE 
HAVE HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS FROM 
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ABOUT, YOU 
KNOW, PROTECTING THE MUELLER 
PROBE, AND NOTHING HAS 
PROTECTED THE LEGISLATION ON 
THE FLOOR AND BUILD IT INTO THE 
PROTECTION HERE, GIVEN 
LAWMAKERS SAID IT WOULD NEVER 
HAPPEN. 
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS GOING ON 
HERE, THE REPORTING IS STILL 
GOING ON, AND THOSE THINGS TO 
CONSIDER. 
>> ALL OF THIS HAPPENING WITH 
THE LOOMING MIDTERM ELECTIONS, 
AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER HOW IT 
WILL PROCEED, A FIRING OR 
RESIGNATION. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VOCAL WHEN 
IT COMES TO CRITICIZING ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, AND ANYONE KEEPING 
TRACK OF IT, YOU KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT, THAT'S NOT HIS 
FAVORITE GUY. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESING 
ABOUT THIS, WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING IN THE NEWS ROOM, WHAT 
IS THE STRATEGY IS AND 
REMEMBER, THEY ARE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE KAVANAUGH BATTLE. 
THE QUESTION THEY RAISED WAS 
RELATED TO THE MULLER PROBE, IN 
SO FAR AS GIVING LIGHT TO 
KAVANAUGH'S PAST STATEMENTS IN 
THAT HE SAID A PRESIDENT UNDER 
INVESTIGATIONCOULD NOT BE 
CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. 
THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT MONTHS 
AGO WHEN HE WAS FIRST 
ANNOUNCED, AND BRINGING THIS 
ALL TO A POINT HERE, RAISING SO 
MANY QUESTIONS, IF, IN FACT, 
HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT, WHY NOW? 
WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
>> RIKKI, YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 
>> IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, 
THE SOLICITOR TAKES OVER. 
>> NOAH FRANCISCO, AND HIS 
POLITICS ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE 
WITH DONALD TRUMP'S, HOWEVER, 
DONALD TRUMP, AND THIS IS WHAT 
I'M READING, HE MAY BE ABLE TO 
APPOINT A TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT 
TO ROD ROSENSTEIN ON AN ACTING 
BASIS FOR UP TO 210 DAYS, SO 
THAT PERSON, AS I THOUGHT 
BEFORE, THEY HAVE TO HAVE 
PREVIOUSLY PASSED A SENATE 
CONFIRMATION FOR ANOTHER POST, 
OR BE A SENIOR OFFICIAL FROM A 
RELEVANT DEPARTMENT, AND SO THE 
PRESIDENT IS IN THE SEAT EITHER 
WAY. 
>> STAND BY RIKKI AND CAITLIN. 
WE ARE GOING TO ED O'KEEFE WHO 
IS STANDING BY, JOINING US FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND ED, WHAT 
ARE YOU HEARING FROM YOUR 
SOURCES, AND WHAT ARE YOU 
HEARING ABOUT WHAT IS 
POTENTIALLY HAPPENING BEHIND 
THOSE CLOSED DOORS BEHIND YOU 
IN THE WEST WING? 
>> Reporter: YOU HAVE HEARD THE 
REPORTING, SEEN THE REPORTING 
THAT ROSENSTEIN IS EXPECTED TO 
GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE AT SOME 
POINT, FOR MEETING WITH VARIOUS 
OFFICIALS, AND THAT'S ALL WE 
KNOW AT THIS POINT. 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS OTHERWISE 
DORMANT TODAY WITH MOST OF THE 
ACTION IN NEW YORK FOR THE 
UNITED NATIONS MEETINGS. 
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE WESTERN 
ENTRANCE TO THE WEST WING ON 
WHAT IS CALLED WEST EXECUTIVE 
DRIVE, A DRIVEWAY RUNNING NORTH 
AND SOUTH, AND IT'S JUST TO -- 
AGAIN, THE WEST OF THE WEST 
WING, AND THAT'S WHERE USUALLY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OTHER 
VISITORS WHO ARE NOT 
NECESSARILY HEADS OF STATE OR 
OTHERS MAKING VISITS TO THE 
WEST WING WILL ARRIVE, AND SO, 
ALL OF US HAVE CAMERAS 
PREPOSITIONED ON THAT ENTRANCE 
TO CATCH PEOPLE WHO VISIT, 
ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE TRYING 
TO DO SO DISCREETLY, BUT AS OF 
YET, OUR TEAM HERE HAS NOT SEEN 
ROSENSTEIN ENTER. 
THAT DOES NOT MEAN HE'S NOT 
HERE. 
THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO GET IN. 
THE REPORTING HE'S ON HIS WAY 
HERE FOR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HIS 
FATE. 
WHETHER HE IS RESIGNING OR 
TELLING THEM THEY NEED TO FIRE 
HIM, THAT'S BEING SORTED OUT. 
WE HAVE SEEN THIS CHICKEN AND 
EGG BEFORE WITH OTHER CABINET 
SECRETARIES WHO GOT CAUGHT UP 
WITH PROBLEMS, MOST RECENTLY 
THE V.A. 
SECRETARY GOING BACK AND FORTH 
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE WHETHER HE 
WAS QUITTING OR BEING FIRED 
THIS IS A FAR MORE GRAVE 
SITUATION, OF COURSE, AND I CAN 
TELL YOU AT THE OTHER END OF 
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, THE 
CAPITOL, THEY ARE AWAITING WORD 
OF THIS WITH PINS AND NEEDLES. 
IT'S BEEN ANTICIPATED FOR A 
YEAR. 
ROSENSTEIN OVERSEES THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, AND 
THERE'S BEEN CONCERN WITH 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, WERE 
THE PRESIDENT TO REMOVE 
ROSENSTEIN, OR ATTEMPT TO 
REMOVE ROBERT MUELLER, YOU MAY 
SEE A VULNERABILITY OVER THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. 
THERE'S LEGISLATION OUT THERE, 
SUPPORTED BY DEMOCRATS AND 
REPUBLICANS, MOSTLY IN THE 
SENATE, AND IT WOULD IN ESSENCE 
PUT IN PROTECTIONS FOR THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
MANY HAVE SAID WE SHOULD DO IT 
NOW IN ADVANCE OF ANY POTENTIAL 
UPENDING, AND OTHERS SAID IT 
WILL NOT BE NECESSARY, AND 
MAYBE WE WILL DO IT IF THE 
PRESIDENT MAKES LINE CHANGES AT 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
THE POLITICAL RESPONSE TO THIS 
COUPLED WITH WHAT IS GOING ON 
WITH THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE IT AN 
EXPLOSIVE DAY IN WASHINGTON, AT 
LEAST FROM A POLITICAL STAND 
POINT. 
WE ARE MONITORING THIS TO WAIT 
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
WITH THE PRESIDENT IN NEW YORK, 
AND ROSENSTEIN HERE, THE 
LIKELIHOOD OF AN IN PERSON 
MEETING IS NOT EXPECTED. 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
HOW IT WILL TRANSPIRE. 
THE EARLY REPORTING, HE 
ESSENTIALLY VERBALLY RESIGNED 
TO THE CBS CHIEF OF STAFF. 
WE HAVE NOT FIRMED  THAT UP, SO 
WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS IN 
REPORTING THAT. 
>> IT COMES ON THE HEELS OF 
REPORTING THAT ROSENSTEIN 
DISCUSSED ENVOKING THE 21st 
AMENDMENT LAST YEAR. 
DID THE PRESIDENT FEEL THE 
FAILING NEW YORK TIMES GONE IT 
-- GOT IT WRONG AGAIN, OR IF HE 
TOOK IT SERIOUSLY. 
>> THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW THAT 
AIRED THIS MORNING WITH THE FOX 
NEWS PERSONALITY WHO ALSO HAS A 
RADIO SHOW, AND HE WAS ASKED 
ABOUT IT, AND HE SAID, I THINK 
IT'S A VERY SAD STORY, AND 
PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING 
INTO IT, BUT IT'S A SAD STATE 
OF AFFAIRS WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT CAN HAPPEN, REFERRING TO 
THE POSSIBILITY THAT ROSENSTEIN 
WAS TALKING SERIOUSLY OR IN A 
JOKE MANNER ABOUT REMOVING THE 
PRESIDENT. 
HE WAS ASKED BY HERALDO WHETHER 
HE WOULD FIRE ROSENSTEIN, AND 
HE SAID, QUOTE, I DON'T WANT TO 
COMMENT ON IT UNTIL I GET ALL 
THE FACTS. 
CERTAINLY IT'S BEING LOOKED AT 
IN TERMS OF WHAT TOOK PLACE, 
AND I WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION 
LATER. 
WHAT THIS MEETING COULD BE 
TODAY, AN ATTEMPT BY THE WHITE 
HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF ON BEHALF 
OF THE PRESIDENT TO GET THE 
FACTS. 
IF HE'S SIGNALING HE WANTS TO 
GO IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS HIM 
TO, THAT MAY BE IT, BUT MAYBE 
THEY WILL LED HIM HOLD ON IF HE 
PROVIDES AN EXPLANATION. 
>> JUST TO SHARE WITH OUR 
VIEWERS, PAULA REID ALSO 
REPORTING FOR US, AND THE 
QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN ON A LOT 
OF PEOPLE'S MINDS RIGHT NOW, 
ED, CAITLYN, AND RIKKI, IF 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD 
ROSENSTEIN GOES, WHAT HAPPENS 
TO THE MUELLER PROBE? 
ACCORDING TO  PAULA, IT'S 
EXPECTED TO PASS  UNLESS THE 
PRESIDENT USES THE VACANCY 
REFORMS ACT. 
I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO TAKE 
THE QUESTION. 
>> VLAD? 
>> YES, ED. 
>> THE SOLICITOR GENERAL IS A 
49-YEAR-OLD FROM HERE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
IF THE NORMAL LINE OF 
SUCCESSION WERE TO BE FOLLOWED, 
IN ESSENCE, HE'S THE THIRD 
RANKING JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
OFFICIAL, SO CONCEIVABLY OR BY 
DEFAULT, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
INVESTIGATION COULD FALL TO 
HIM, DEPENDING WHO THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL APPOINTS IN A TEMPORARY 
CAPACITY TO BE HIS NUMBER TWO. 
WERE IT TO BE NOLE, IT COULD BE 
HIM. 
STEVEN ENGLA IS A FORMER 
SUBSTANTIAL ATTORNEY GENERAL, 
AND THE PRESIDENT COULD 
CONCEIVABLY TRY TO PUT IN 
SOMEONE ELSE ON A TEMPORARY 
BASIS, EVENTUALLY REQUIRING 
SENATE CONFIRMATION OF THE 
POSITION, BUT I DEFAULT AT 
LEAST, IT WOULD BE THIS 49-YEAR-
OLD. 
HE WOULD BE THE FIRST ASIAN 
AMERICAN TO HOLD THE POSITION. 
HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME OF 
THE MOST CONTENTIOUS LEGAL 
BATTLES. 
HE WAS INVOLVED IN RECESS 
APPOINTMENTS DURING THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION AND RELIGIOUS 
ASPECTS OF THE FREEDOM CARE 
ACT. 
>> A REPUBLICAN LEGAL FOOT 
SOLDIER, IF YOU WILL, NOW 
SERVING IN THE POSITION, 
CONCEIVABLY FALLING TO HIM 
UNLESS THEY TRY TO PUT 
SOMETHING ELSE IN CHARGE. 
>> SO, I ASKED EARLIER, DOES 
THE PERSON WHO IS APPOINTED 
HAVE TO BE PART OF THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
COULD THE PRESIDENT, COULD HE 
SORT OF PICK SOMEONE FROM 
ANYWHERE? 
>> THE UNITED STATES FOR 
EXAMPLE? 
>> LIKE ONE OF HIS PALS. 
>> TO GAME THIS OUT, THERE'S 
REPORTING THAT THE PRESIDENT, 
AT SOME POINT, WILL, YOU KNOW, 
IT'S SPECULATION, BUT IT'S BEEN 
REPORTED THAT AFTER THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS, HE MAY DECIDE TO GET 
RID OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
IF YOU KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE, AND 
IT'S ALSO BEEN REPORTED THAT 
PEOPLE ARE ANGLING TO BE THE 
NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND SOME 
OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY 
UNITED STATES SENATORS. 
COULD A UNITED STATES SENATOR 
BE THE DEPUTY A.G. 
AND WAIT FOR THE MOMENT WHEN 
THE PRESIDENT GETS RID OF THE 
A.G.? 
>> Reporter: THEY COULD BE, BUT 
IF THEY COULD BE CONFIRMED 
BEFORE THE END OF THE CALENDAR 
YEAR OR IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
LOOKING SENATE NEXT YEAR AFTER 
THE ELECTIONS, THAT'S UNCLEAR. 
I THINK THIS REPORTING, THIS 
MOMENT, IT COMES A THE A TRICKY 
TIME FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, AND 
YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S BEEN 
PLENTY OF CHATTER ABOUT JEFF 
SESSIONS GOING AT THE TOP OF 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE 
POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO FIND 
SOMEONE ELSE, AND IF ROSENSTEIN 
GOES, TOO, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE 
TO CREATE A LEADERSHIP VACUUM, 
AND WHO COULD THAT BE WHEN THE 
SENATE IS DIVIDED AND IF IT 
FLIPS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE NARROW 
CONTROL, THAT REMAINS 
UNCERTAIN. 
IT CREATES CONSTERNATION FOR 
FOLKS, NOT JUST DOWN THE 
STREET, BUT HERE ON CAPITOL 
HILL AND AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT 
JUST FOCUSED ON THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, IT'S ALL 
SORTS OF MATTERS, AND A REAL 
VACUUM AT THE TOP, CREATING 
PROBLEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
>> AND JUST TO REMIND EVERYBODY 
OF WHAT IS GOING ON, WHY YOU 
ARE SEEING THE SHOT OF A 
PARKING LOT HERE, AND WE ARE 
EXPECTING ROD ROSENSTEIN TO 
COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND IT 
LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS VIDEO 
EARLIER, HE GOT INTO A CAR, 
HEADED THAT WAY, AND THE 
REPORTING IS, INITIALLY FROM 
AXIOS, HE, ACCORDING TO THEIR 
REPORTING, NOT CBS REPORTING, 
CBS HAS NOT CONFIRMED THIS. 
HE OFFERED TO RESIGN TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, AND 
THAT HE IS GOING TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE NOW, PRESUMABLY TO 
DISCUSS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE 
LINES, WHETHER HE IS GOING TO 
BE FIRED OR WHETHER HE IS GOING 
TO OFFER OFFICIALLY HIS 
RESIGNATION, WE DON'T KNOW, BUT 
WE KNOW HE IS GOING TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT THERE. 
THE PRESIDENT IS IN NEW YORK 
CITY AT THE UNITED STATES, AND 
PRESUMABLY HE WOULD BE TALKING 
 
STAFF, AND THE QUESTION SORT OF 
MOVING FORWARD IS, IF HE IS 
REMOVED, WHAT DOES THAT -- MANY 
QUESTIONS WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. 
>> WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY? 
>> ONE PERSON WHO HAS A POINT 
OF VIEW ABOUT THAT, ANDREW 
McCABE. 
HE JUST RELEASED A STATEMENT, 
YOU ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 
RUSSIA PROBE, AND HE SAID IN A 
STATEMENT, THERE IS NOTHING 
MORE IMPORTANT TO THE INTEGRITY 
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE RULE 
OF LAW PROTECTING THE 
INVESTIGATION OF THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER. 
I SACRIFICED PERSONALLY AND 
PROFESSIONALLY AND SUBSEQUENTLY 
MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PROTECT 
IT. 
TO BE CLEAR, I HAD NO ROLE IN 
PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION IN 
ANY KIND TO THE MEDIA FOLLOWING 
DIRECTOR COMEY'S FIRING, IF THE 
RUMORS OF THE DEPUTY A.G.'S 
DEPARTURE ARE TRUE, I'M DEEPLY 
CONCERNED IT PUTS THE 
INVESTIGATION AT RISK, AND SO, 
TO ED'S POINT, CAITLYN, YOU 
HAVE COVERED POLITICS FOR A 
LONG TIME, AND RIKKI IS ALSO 
HERE. 
GIVEN WHERE NOAH FRANCISCO IS, 
WOULD THIS PUT THE 
INVESTIGATION AT RISK IF 
FRANCISCO IS THE DEPUTY A.G.? 
>> THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION, AND 
LET'S TAKE A STEP AND REMEMBER 
WHY WE ARE IN THIS PLACE, 
WONDERING WHAT IS GOING ON HERE 
WITH ROSENSTEIN AND THE NEW 
YORK TIMES REPORTED ON FRIDAY, 
HE SPOKE ABOUT ENVOKING 25th 
AMENDMENT AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT, SPOKE ABOUT WEARING 
A WIRE WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND 
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
REPORTING AND ALSO THE 
WASHINGTON POST REPORTING IF HE 
WAS BEING SARCASTIC IN THE 
CONVERSATIONS, AND IF THE 
INFORMATION WAS COMING FROM THE 
MEMOS RELEASED AND WRITTEN BY 
ANDREW McCABE. 
THAT'S JUST TIEING ALL THE 
POINTS TOGETHER HERE. 
POLITICALLY SPEAKING, THE 
QUESTION OF THE MUELLER PROBE 
IS FRONT AND CENTER OF THE 
CAMPAIGN IN THE ELECTION 
PROCESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE 
STARTED TO HEAR A LOT FROM 
REPUBLICANS ENVOKING THE 
PRESIDENT'S OWN LANGUAGE 
RELATED TO THE MUELLER PROBE. 
YOU HAVE HEARD THE REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATES CALLING IT A WITCH 
HUNT. 
THERE'S A SMALL GROUP IN THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE 
PRESIDENT'S SIDE, AND THEY HAVE 
TRIED TO FILE LETTERS TO 
IMPEACH ROD ROSENSTEIN. 
THE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE SOME 
SUPPORT AMONG THE REPUBLICANS 
HERE. 
THE DEMOCRATS, OF COURSE, HAVE 
RAISED THE CONCERN OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN, AND THEY CALLED FOR 
LEGISLATION TO BE BROUGHT TO 
THE FLOOR TO BE VOTEED ON TO 
ADD LEGAL PROTECTION FOR THE 
MUELLER PROBE.  
A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE, 
CERTAINLY, BUT WE ARE JUST 5 OR 
SO WEEKS AWAY FROM THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS, AND WHAT IT COULD 
PROMPT THE PRESIDENT TOE DO AND 
HOW VOTERS REACT -- 
>> STAND BY. 
ADDING TO THE MIX, WE HAVE -- 
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
POINTING TO THE STATEMENT. 
YOU'RE JOINING US ON THE PHONE, 
ALSO, TO PROVIDE CONTEXT TO THE 
25th AMENDMENT, ERRO. 
>>> THERE THE TALK HAS BEEN IN 
DISCUSSION FOR SOME TIME IT 
PROVIDE THE VICE PRESIDENT AND 
THE MAJORITY OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
CABINET TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES IF HE'S 
UNABLE, AND IT'S QUOTING MY 
CIVICS CLASS, IF HE'S UNABLE TO 
PERFORM THE DUTIES OF THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THAT'S CORRECT, VLAD AND 
ANNE-MARIE. 
WE JUST SPOKE TO TWO MEMBERS, 
REALLY THREE MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S CABINET, SPEAKING
TO REPORTERS A FEW MOMENTS AGO, 
NEXT TO THE U.N.  AS THEY TRIED 
TO OUTLINE THE PRESIDENT'S 
PRIORITIES THIS WEEK AT GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY. 
MIKE POMPEO SAID IT WAS A 
LUDICROUS QUESTION TO ASK HIM 
IF THERE WERE ANY CONVERSATIONS 
THAT HE IS AWARE OF OF ENVOKING 
25th AMENDMENT. 
NIKKI HALEY WITH THE SAME 
RESPONSE, SAYING IN NO WAY 
SHAPE OR FORM HAS SHE BEEN A 
PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS OR 
BEEN AWARE OF OTHER PEOPLE 
HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS. 
AS YOU TALK ABOUT REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATES MIRRORING THE 
PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE, NOW HIS 
CABINET, ONE-BY-ONE IS SAYING 
AS FAR AS THEY WERE AWARE, THEY 
WERE NOT PART OF ANY CHAT ABOUT 
REMOVING PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM 
OFFICE BECAUSE OF A PERCEIVED 
INABILITY TO CONDUCT THE 
BUSINESS AS A COUNTRY. 
THIS UNDERSCORES, VLAD AND ANNE-
MARIE, YOU EFFECTIVELY HAVE 
TURMOIL IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT, TAKING PLACE 
PRECISELY AT THE TIME PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND HIS PLATFORM ARE 
PROMOTING THE U.N. THERE'S 
CONCERN THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS 
WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL WILL OVERSHADOW THE 
NEXT 48 HOURS, FINDING THE 
PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE U.N. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO SET OUT HIS 
PRIORITIES, AND HE WILL CHAIR 
ON WEDNESDAY A U.N. SECURITY 
COUNCIL BRIEFING, FOCUSING ON 
IRAN. 
YOU WILL HAVE THE MAJOR 
BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY TAKING 
PLACE AS THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
DIPLOMATIC TEAM TRY TO CONVINCE 
THE REST OF THE WORLD TO 
COOPERATE IN THE U.S. PLANS, 
AND HE APPEARS WEAKER AT HOME. 
TWO MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET, 
MOMENTS AGO, SAYING THE 
DISCUSSIONS, ENVOKING THE 25th 
AMENDMENT ARE LUDICROUS, AND 
THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE NOT 
TAKEN PLACE. 
>> YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT, 
ERROL, AT THE U.N., IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
TALK ABOUT THE SUCCESSES HE HAS 
HAD, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE 
OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH NORTH 
KOREA, AND CERTAINLY BETWEEN 
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA, 
THERE IS PROGRESS, AND SORT OF 
IN THE SHADOWS, KAVANAUGH'S 
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, AND YOU 
KNOW IT'S BECOMING A MESS, AND 
IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
PRESIDENT TO LOOK PRESIDETIAL 
IN FRONT OF OTHER WORLD 
LEADERS, AND NOW, ONCE AGAIN, 
WE ARE DISTRACTED TWOFOLD. 
BY THE BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARING, 
AND THIS BOMB SHELL THAT ROD 
ROSENSTEIN IS HEADED TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND YOU KNOW, 
CAITLIN, I WANT TO ASK YOU WHAT 
DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DAY 
FOR THE PRESIDENT. 
>> IT'S SIGNIFICANT HE'S NOT 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
IF HE'S HAVING CONVERSATIONS 
WITH JOHN KELLY, AND IF HE'S 
GOING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS 
WITH JOHN KELLY, AND WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT'S CONVERSATIONS WITH 
JOHN KELLY HAVE BEEN, AND YOU 
KNOW, THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, 
AND ALSO, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER, 
TOO, THAT, THERE WERE A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT ROD 
ROSENSTEIN AFTER THE REPORTING 
ABOUT KIND OF, YOU KNOW, THESE 
CLAIMS WILL HE HAD MADE, WOULD 
HE BE, YOU KNOW, CALLED INTO 
CONGRESS TO HAVE TO TESTIFY IN 
FRONT OF CONGRESS? 
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE A LOT OF 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO 
CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO HEAR 
FROM HIM AFTER THE NEW YORK 
TIMES REPORTING, AND YOU SAW A 
LOT OF THE PRESIDENT'S ALLIES 
SEIZING ON THE REPORTING, AND 
WE WERE WONDERING KIND OF WHAT 
WOULD IT PROMPT THE PRESIDENT 
TO DO? 
WE HEARD FROM THE FOX NEWS 
CABLE HOST WHO IS CLOSE WITH 
THE PRESIDENT, HAS THE 
PRESIDENT'S EAR, AND HE'S 
CONSIDERED AN INFORMAL ADVISER 
TO HIM, SAYING HE SHOULD NOT 
FIRE ROD ROSENSTEIN, AND THAT'S 
SIGNIFICANT. 
THAT SEEMED TO SIGNAL THE 
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF DOING 
THAT WOULD BE STARK, EVEN FOR 
THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENDERS HERE. 
A LOT OF ONGOING QUESTIONS. 
>> DEFINITELY. 
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA 
OF NOAH FRANCISCO, I KEEP GOING 
BACK TO THAT IF THE IDEA IS TO 
GET RID OF ROSENSTEIN TO WRAP 
UP THE INVESTIGATION, SEAN 
HENNEDY'S POINT, DON'T DO THIS. 
IT'S A TRAP. 
IT GIVES YOUR ENEMIES THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, YOU'RE 
TRYING TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE, AND 
THAT'S PERILOUS. 
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD BE 
PERILOUS IF THERE WERE NO 
CAUSE. 
QUOTE, END QUOTE CAUSE, TO FIRE 
ROD ROSENSTEIN. 
>> YOU KNOW, BUT BEFORE MIKE 
POMPEO, YOU KNOW, WHO IS THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE, REX 
TELLERSON, WAS QUOTED BY  -- 
TILLERSON WAS QUOTED CALLING 
THE PRESIDENT A MORON. 
IF CAUSE IS JUST TALKING ABOUT 
DOING SOMETHING, IS THAT 
ENOUGH? 
>> IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE ENOUGH, 
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS, LET'S 
ASSUME, FOR THE SAKE OF 
ARGUMENT, THAT FRANCISCO, 
SHOULD IT ALL COME TO PASS, 
WINDS UP ASSUMING THE ROLE, 
IT'S NOW SEPTEMBER 24th, AND 
THE MIDTERMS ARE IN THE 
BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER. 
DOES ANYONE SITTING IN HIS 
PLACE WANT TO  BE ON THIS IN 
THE EVE OF THE MIDTERMS? 
THE ANSWER IS NO. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. 
>> REGARDLES OF HOW HE FEELS 
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION OR HOW 
THE PRESIDENT FEELS ABOUT IT, 
WHAT THE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN 
USED IS IF McCABE GOES, 
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. 
WHAT DOES CONGRESS DO? 
YOU POINTED OUT, CAITLYN, 
THERE'S LEGISLATION CRAFTED TO 
PROTECT THE SPECIAL COUNCIL. 
>> YOU MEANT  ROBERT MUELLER? 
>> SORRY. 
WHAT DID I SAY. 
>> McCABE. 
HE'S ALREADY GONE. 
>>> THE SENATE WAS SUPPOSED TO 
BE A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR 
REPUBLICANS, JUST LOOKING AT 
THE MAP AND WHERE THE 
COMPETITIVE RACES ARE, AND IF 
SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH 
ROSENSTEIN, DOES THAT THROW 
MORE RACES IN FLUX, AND PERHAPS 
THE DEMOCRATS COULD INCREASE 
THEIR NUMBERS, AND THE 
PRESIDENT IS VERY -- HIS 
STRATEGISTS SAY HE SHOULD BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE MIDTERMS, 
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS PARTY 
AND POWER, BUT THE IDEA OF 
IMPEACHMENT, POSSIBLE 
IMPEACHMENT, YOU HAVE HEARD THE 
PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT 
IMPEACHMENT, AND THE REPUBLICAN 
CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF IMPEACHMENT, 
TRYING TO BRING UP THE BASE TO 
SAY IF YOU ELECT DEMOCRATS, 
THEY WILL MOVE TO IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT. 
THAT'S A FACTOR HERE. 
YOU HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE 
REPUBLICANS HERE, AND ED 
MENTIONED FOR THE LAST YEAR OR 
SO, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN 
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
MUELLER PROBE, AND HE SHOULD 
JUST LET THEM PLAY OUT, AND YOU 
HEARD FROM INVESTIGATORS ON THE 
COMMITTEE, AND REPUBLICANS SAID 
THE SAME THING, AND THEY ARE 
VERY AWARE, AND REPUBLICANS IN 
CONGRESS ARE VERY AWARE OF THE 
STAKES HERE. 
>> COULD WHOEVER TAKES OVER FOR 
ROD ROSENSTEIN, IF THEY CHOOSE 
NOT TO RESOLVE THE 
INVESTIGATION, COULD THEY PUT A 
DEADLINE ON THE INVESTIGATION, 
AND RIKKI, YOU TALKED ABOUT A 
COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE 
PIPELINE, SENTENCING, AND YOU 
KNOW, SORT OF, LIKE THREE 
DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON. 
>> MICHAEL COHAN. 
MICHAEL FLYNN IS CERTAINLY 
UNDER MUELLER'S PROBE, AND THEN 
MANAFORT. 
>> YOU DO HAVE THREE THING IN 
THE MIX, AND YOU ALSO HAVE, I 
THINK THE SPECTER OF TWO OTHER 
THINGS, ONE IN CONGRESS AND ONE 
IN MUELLER'S OFFICE. 
IN THE CONGRESS, FOR HEAVEN 
SAKE, IT'S SEPTEMBER 2018, AND 
THEY HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THIS 
WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING TO PASS 
LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION OR NOT, 
AND THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT 
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT WAS NOT 
NECESSARY TO HAVE TO DO THAT. 
MAYBE IT WAS. 
THE OTHER THING, WE DON'T KNOW. 
NONE OF US KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S 
NEVER A LEAK OUT OF ROBERT 
MUELLER'S OFFICE, AND ROBERT 
MUELLER'S OFFICE, WE DON'T KNOW 
IF THEY HAVE CRAFTED AN INTERIM 
REPORT, OR IF THEY LOOKED AT 
RUSSIAN COLLUSION, AND THEY ARE 
REWORKING THE REPORT AS TIME 
GOES ON, AND SAME THING WITH 
OBSTRUCTION, AND IF THINGS 
START TO GET DICEY, I DON'T 
EXPECT MUELLER TO HAVE TO 
SUDDENLY BECOME A SCRIPTER AND 
START FROM SCRATCH. 
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. 
YOU ADD TO IT, THE SAME WAY AS 
I WOULD DO LEGAL RESEARCH. 
YOU WRITE AS YOU GO, AND YOU 
ADD TO IT, AND IT'S ALWAYS 
POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE GUN, 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO ISSUE A 
REPORT FASTER, OR SOONER RATHER 
THAN LATER. 
>> WE HAVE JUST SORT OF BEEN 
HANDED A RESPONSE, AND WE ARE 
SEEING HOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
RESPONDING IN SORT OF 
HINDSIGHT, BUT, REPRESENTATIVE 
GOUTY WAS ON WITH JOHN 
DICKERSON, AND JOHN ASKED HIM 
ABOUT THE REPORTING ABOUT THE 
25th AMENDMENT AND WHAT HE 
WOULD EXPECT FROM ROD 
ROSENSTEIN AND HE SAID ROD 
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD, 
AND I'M SURE AT SOME POINT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL BRING ROD IN AND 
INCOMPETENT, IF YOU FEEL THE 
NEED TO WEAR A WIRE WHEN YOU'RE 
TALKING WITH ME, THEN WHY ARE 
YOU SERVING IN MY 
ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT GOES 
BACK TO SORT OF THE HAVING 
CAUSE TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY, 
RIGHT? 
>> IT ALSO GOES BACK TO THE 
FACT THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING OR 
TREY IS ASSUMING RATIONAL 
CONVERSATION. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> IN A VERY IRRATIONAL MOMENT. 
>> THE OTHER THING, THE 
BACKDROP OF THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE. 
WHEN WE USE THE WORDS 
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, ON ONE 
HAND YOU NEED BRETT KAVANAUGH 
TO BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT. 
HE'S ON THE RECORD ABOUT HOW HE 
FEELS AROUND INVESTIGATIONS OF 
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES, RIGHT? 
>> YES, BUT THE CENTER OF 
DEMOCRATS ARGUMENT AGAINST HIM 
GOING INTO THIS. 
>> RIGHT, BUT ON THE OTHER 
HAND, YOU HAVE VERY SERIOUS 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE 
NOMINEE, WHICH IT'S ALWAYS BEEN 
SAID ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL, 
HE'S NOT GOING TO PUT HIS 
MEMBERS AT RISK IF THE VOTE 
DOESN'T GO HOW HE EXPECTS IT TO 
GO. 
>> IT'S QUESTIONING THE MEMBERS 
OF THE SENATE WITH THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. 
MANY DON'T FEEL THE ALLEGIANCE 
TO HIM, AND THEY ARE RETIRING. 
FLAKE, CORKER, OF COURSE, KEY 
VOTES, AND ALSO FOCUSING ON 
COLLINS AND LISA TO SWING THE 
VOTES IN THE SENATE, AND THE 
REPUBLICANS ALSO HAPPEN TO BE 
WOMEN, AND WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS IN TERMS OF 
ROSENSTEIN, AND AGAIN, WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR 
WHAT IS HAPPENING OR WHAT THE 
CONVERSATIONS ARE, BE CLEAR 
ABOUT THAT, BUT IF SOMETHING 
DOES, IN FACT, HAPPEN, THAT 
REMOVES ROSENSTEIN AND RAISES 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROBE, I'M 
WONDERING IF THAT WILL ALSO 
BRING UP ADDITIONAL CONCERNS 
FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO WERE 
ALREADY ON THE FENCE ABOUT 
KAVANAUGH, AND KIND OF WHAT IT 
MEANS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY 
HAVE NOT BEEN EXTREMELY PLEASED 
WITH THERHETORIC COMING OUT 
FROM THE PRESIDENT AND HAVE 
CALLED FOR PROTECTIONS FOR THIS 
PROBE OR JUST TO ALLOW IT TO 
CONTINUE. 
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 
SWING SENATORS, YEAH, THAT WILL 
BE INTERESTING. 
>>> LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT 
FOR THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR. 
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, 
COME BACK, REGROUP, AND WE WILL 
HAVE MORE INFORMATION. 
STICK AROUND. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE A CAMERA 
TRAINED ON THAT ENTRANCE RIGHT 
THERE, AND WE COULD BE WRONG. 
THERE'S A NUMBER OF ENTRANCES 
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT A 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE FEEL THIS IS 
WHERE ROD ROSENSTEIN IS GOING 
TO APPEAR AT SOME POINT. 
WE HAVE A CAMERA THERE, AND 
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE NEWS 
FIRST REPORTED BY AXIUS, AND 
IT'S BEEN UNCONFIRMED, THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, IN CHARGE OF THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN 
THE 2016 ELECTION, EXPECTS TO 
BE FIRED, AND PERHAPS HE 
VERBALLY OR IN SOME WAY 
COMMUNICATED HE WAS RESIGNING 
TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN 
KELLY, AND NOW HE'S ON HIS WAY 
TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING FOR THE 
VIEWERS, THE ONLY THING WE CAN 
CONFIRM, ROD ROSENSTEIN IS ON 
HIS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE'S THERE 
ALREADY. 
MAYBE HE'S NOT. 
WE DON'T KNOW. 
WE HAVE CAITLI, AND INSIDE HUEW 
BURNS AND R -- WE HAVE CAITLI! 
HUEY BURNS AND RIKKI KLIEMAN 
HERE. 
YESTERDAY ON FACE THE NATION 
THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW, TALKING 
ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS MADE ON 
FRIDAY THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL IN THE WAKE OF FIRING 
OF JAMES COMEY MADE THE 
SUGGESTION HE COULD RECORD THE 
PRESIDENT OR THAT HE WOULD TRY 
TO ENGAGE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S CABINET IN 
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE 25th 
AMENDMENT, WHICH IS THERE TO 
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES IF THE VICE 
PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS OF 
THE CABINET FEEL HE CANNOT 
CARRY OUT HIS DUTIES. 
I JUST LAID OUT WHERE WE ARE 
FOR THE TOP OF THE HOUR FOR OUR 
VIEWERS. 
>> WE HAVE FRANCO ORDONES, A 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT ON 
THE PHONE NOW. 
FRANCO, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT WHAT IT COULD MEAN, 
WHETHER A FIRING, VERSUS A 
RESIGNATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE, 
AND AS YOU HEAR THE POTENTIAL, 
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS 
YOU'RE PONDERING ABOUT WITH 
WHAT THE FALLOUT MAY BE IF ROD 
ROSENSTEIN LEAVES OR IS FIRED? 
>> I THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS, 
WHAT DOES THIS DO TO THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, OF 
COURSE, AND YOU KNOW, 
ROSENSTEIN HAS BEEN WALKING A 
TIGHT ROPE FOR A LONG TIME, AND 
IT'S BEEN BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION, AND MUELLER, 
AFTER SESSIONS RECUSED HIMSELF, 
IT WAS MUELLER WHO HAS BEEN 
OVERSEEING THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION INTO QUESTIONS 
ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AND 
THE ELECTION, AND RUSSIAN 
INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TRUMP 
CAMPAIGN, AND AS I SAID, HE'S 
BEEN KIND OF WALKING THE 
SITUATION WHERE HE HAS TO 
PROTECT THE INVESTIGATION 
AGAINST TRUMP'S ALLEGATIONS 
THAT IT'S A WITCH HUNT, AND HE 
HAD TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DEFEND 
IT TOO MUCH. 
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE 
SITUATION WHERE HE IS 
ESSENTIALLY BEING REMOVED FROM 
HIS POSITION, AND IF THAT'S THE 
CASE, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE ELSE 
WILL COME IN, AND A NEW PERSON 
COULD ESSENTIALLY REFUSE TO 
APPROVE THE REQUEST, AND IT 
COULD SLOW DOWN THE 
INVESTIGATION, BRING IT TO A 
CRAWL, OR WORSE, TRUMP, IN 
ANOTHER SITUATION, TRUMP COULD 
OPEN THE DOOR FOR TRUMP GETTING 
RID OF MUELLER HIMSELF. 
>> YEAH, IN DEED, AND AS YOU 
TALKED BEFORE, EARLIER, IT'S 
HAPPENING WITH, YOU KNOW, THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS LOOMING, AND 
THERE ARE, SORT OF THINGS THAT 
COULD HAPPEN, AS PART OF THE 
LINE OF SUCCESSION, PEOPLE CAN 
TAKE OVER, AND THEN THE 
PERCEPTION, HOW THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC FEELS ABOUT NOT JUST THE 
PRESIDENT, BUT OBVIOUSLY 
CONGRESS AND THE SENATE AND THE 
OTHER REPUBLICANS, AND WHETHER 
OR NOT THEY FEEL THERE'S A 
DELIBERATE ATTEMPT, MAYBE 
BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES 
ALLOWING IT, TO OBSTRUCT 
JUSTICE HERE. 
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS 
INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT. 
>> NO, THERE'S NO QUESTION 
ABOUT IT. 
I THINK A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS 
ON WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON. 
A LOT OF THE FEELINGS IN THE 
PUBLIC, IT'S POLARIZED RIGHT 
NOW IN THE COUNTRY. 
IF YOU'RE AN ALLY OF THE 
PRESIDENT, YOU'RE FEELING THE 
PRESIDENT IS, AGAIN, TAKING 
UNPOPULAR STEPS TO GET RID OF 
SOMEONE WHO IS ACTIVELY BEEN 
WORKING AGAINST THE 
ADMINISTRATION, ACTIVELY 
WORKING AGAINST SOMEONE WHO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF AS 
QUSTIONED HIS LOYALTY AND IF 
HE CAN BE QUESTIONED. 
IF YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OR 
SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND FEELS 
IT'S RIGHT, YOU ARE FEELING 
IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION A BIT 
UNRAVELING. 
TRUMP AT WAR WITH HIS OWN 
GOVERNMENT, AND IT'S SEEING HOW 
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REALLY 
TAKEN, YOU KNOW, TAKEN IT APART 
AND HURT THE UNITED STATES'  
BIGGEST INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE 
FBI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING. 
AN HOUR INTO THIS, WE ARE IN 
THE NEWS ROOM, AND WE CAN SEE 
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING, 
AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A 
SLIGHT PULLBACK ON THE NEWS, 
AND EVERYONE IS SAYING THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL IS JUST 
ON THE WAY TO MEET WITH THE 
CHIEF OF STAFF. 
HE'S BEEN SUMMONED TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
I WONDER YOUR SOURCES, YOU SIT 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND YOU 
TALK TO FOLKS, AND I KNOW SARAH 
SANDERS IS IN NEW YORK, BUT I 
DON'T KNOW WHO IS THERE FROM 
THE PRESS OFFICE IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE, BUT WHAT ARE YOU HEARING 
 
WHY ROD ROSENSTEIN IS ON HIS 
WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE? 
AND WHAT POTENTIALLY IT ALL 
MEANS? 
>> I MEAN, I THINK SIMILAR TO 
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING IN 
THE PAST, THERE'S SO MUCH 
UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW, AND WE HAVE 
HEARD DIFFERENT THINGS, YOU 
KNOW, HE DELIVERED A MESSAGE TO 
-- ORALLY TO JOHN KELLY, BUT 
NOW THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THAT, AND AS YOU POINTED OUT, 
ALL OF THE CAMERAS ARE NOW, YOU 
KNOW, EYEING ON THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND WAITING TO SEE IF HE 
WILL WALK THROUGH THE SCREEN 
SHOT, AND BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS IF HE IS GOING TO 
BE FIRED, IF HE IS RESIGNING, 
OR IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. 
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT, THIS HAS 
BEEN KIND OF COUNTDOWN AS TO 
WHETHER ROSENSTEIN COULD 
SURVIVE THIS CONTINUED PELTING 
FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, 
AFTER THAT REPORT FROM THE NEW 
YORK TIMES, SAYING HE 
POTENTIALLY WAS GOING TO WEAR A 
WIRE, IF HE WAS GOING TO ENVOKE 
THE 25th AMENDMENT OR NOT. 
WHETHER JUST IN JEST OR JUST 
FLOATING THE IDEA, THAT 
CERTAINLY STRUCK THE PRESIDENT, 
AND IT HIT A NERVE THAT, YOU 
KNOW, ALREADY HAS BEEN VERY 
SENSITIVE FOR A LONG TIME, SO, 
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN THESE 
THINGS IN THE PAST WHERE 
THERE'S RUMBLES IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE START, AND OFTEN TIMES 
THEY END UP WITH A TOP LEADER 
LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
LEAVING THE ADMINISTRATION. 
>> CAITLIN DO YOU WANT TO SAY 
SOMETHING? 
>> WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU 
HAVE BEEN HEARING IN TERMS OF 
THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORT THAT 
WOULD SUGGEST THAT ROSENSTEIN 
WAS COMPROMISED IN ANY WAY IN 
TERMS OF HIS ABILITY TO OVERSEE 
THE INVESTIGATION GIVEN WHAT 
WAS IN THE REPORTING? 
>> NO. 
I SAY THAT ON THE BASIS OF 
BEING A LAWYER. 
WE ARE LOOKING AT AN 
INVESTIGATION, AND ACCORDING TO 
LAW, ROBERT MUELLER STILL HAS 
AN IMPECCABLE REPUTATION FOR 
ETHICS AND INTEGRITY, AND HE IS 
GOING FORWARD TO FIND THE 
TRUTH, WHEREVER THE TRUTH IS 
AND WHEREVER THE FACTS WILL 
LEAD HIM. 
ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS BEEN 
OVERSEEING IT, BUT NOT IN THE 
SENSE OF IN ANY WAY, QUOTE, END 
QUOTE, CORRUPTLY OR WITH 
CORRUPT INTENT OR WITH JUST 
INAPPROPRIATE INTENT IN HIS 
DIRECTION OF ROBERT MULER, AND 
-- 
>> KEEP IN MIND, THAT'S A GOOD 
POINT YOU MAKE, AND ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT WAS IN THE NEW YORK 
TIMES REPORT BECAUSE IT'S 
ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED IN THE WAKE 
OF FIRING OF JAMES COMEY. 
ROD ROSENSTEIN WROTE A LETTER 
SAYING THESE ARE THE REASONS 
WHY, AND HE THEN SAID, IT'S 
BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN 
INVESTIGATION. 
YOU'RE LIKE, YOU JUST PUT ME 
OUT THERE. 
>> THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF 
DISTRESS ON THE PART OF ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, AND FROM MY SOURCES 
IN WASHINGTON, PEOPLE WHO KNOW 
HIM VERY WELL, AT THAT POINT, 
HE WAS IN A GREAT DEAL OF 
TURMOIL, AND HE FELT HE WAS 
MIDDLED, USED, AND HE DID NOT 
INTEND, WHEN HE WROTE THE 
REPORT TO BECOME THE WHIPPING 
BOY, AND THE RESULTS OF IT, IT 
WAS THAT HE WINDS UP CALLING 
FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
INVESTIGATION AND APPOINTING 
ROBERT MUELLER, WHICH, AS STEVE 
BANNON HAS SAID, IT WAS THE 
WORST POLITICAL DECISION IN 
HISTORY IF I'M QUOTING STEVE 
BANNON CORRECTLY, AND IT WAS AT 
A TIME THAT, IF IN FACT, ROD 
ROSENSTEIN UTTERED ANYTHING IN 
WORDS ABOUT THE 25th AMENDMENT, 
OR IF HE WAS JOKING, OR SERIOUS 
ABOUT WEARING A WIRE, AND I 
HAVE GOT TO ASSUME HE WAS 
JOKING, WHICH WAS INAPPROPRIATE 
 
AT A TIME THAT EMOTIONS WERE 
RUN ARING HIGH. 
IT'S A YEAR AGO! 
IT'S MORE THAN THAT. 
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. 
>> TO YOUR POINT ABOUT HOW HE 
HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF WITH THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, FOR ALL 
EXTENTS AND PURPOSES, WE DON'T 
KNOW, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE HAS 
BEEN INCORRUPTIBLE TO USE YOUR 
WORDS? 
>> I THINK SO, AND NOW 
REASONABLE MINDS COULD CONSIDER 
BECAUSE IT COULD CERTAINLY BE 
SAID BY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE 
DIFFERENTLY THAN I DO THE DATA 
SAYS HIS SUPERVISION, THEY 
WOULD SAY, WELL, ISN'T IT 
INTERESTING HE DECIDED TO FARM 
OUT THE  COHAN CASE TO THE 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
WHILE THEY WERE WORKING ON THE 
MANAFORT CASE. 
ISN'T IT INTERESTING FOR ROD 
ROSENSTEIN TO DECIDE TO GO 
AFTER MANAFORT'S ACTIVITIES IN 
LOBBYING AND WORKING FOR THE 
PRORUSSIAN FEDERATION IN 
UKRAINE YEARS BEFORE. 
WASN'T IT INTERESTING THERE 
WERE TWO INDICTMENTS FOR PAUL 
MANAFORT FOR WHAT POSSIBLE 
PURPOSE THAN TO GET MANAFORT TO 
FLIP? 
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO MAY LOOK AT 
ROD ROSENSTEIN'S CONDUCT HAS 
PRESSURE, PRESSURE, PRESSURE 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. 
I DO NOT LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, 
BUT THERE'S OTHERS WHO DO. 
>> THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO ASK 
ED O'KEEFE. 
I WAS ASK THINKING THE SAME  -- 
I WAS THINKING THE SAME LINES 
AS YOU.  
IF THERE WAS A FRACTURE, IT 
STARTED EARLY ON, WITH THE 
LETTER EXPLAINING WHY JAMES 
COMEY NEEDED TO BE FIRED. 
I WONDERED ED, OR ANYONE ELSE, 
IF YOU HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY 
WITH HOW ROD ROSENSTEIN FELT 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, FELT ABOUT 
THE WAY HE WAS BEING TREATED. 
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE EASY TO 
HAVE TWEETS GO OUT THERE, AND 
HE CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE A 
CONSERVATIVE GUY. 
HE'S NOT JUMPING ON TWITTER AND 
RESPONDING IN ANY WAY. 
>> HE'S BEEN ASKED A FEW TIMES 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 
YEAR AND A HALF OR SO, AND YOU 
KNOW, HAS NOT TIPPED HIS HAT 
EITHER WAY. 
WE KNOW FROM THE REPORTING DONE 
BY OUR COLLEAGUES HERE, 
OBVIOUSLY HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT 
THIS, AND HE IS FOCUSED ON 
KEEPING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
INVESTIGATION, ITSELF, INTACT, 
AND IN A REPUTABLE STATE. 
IT SHOWS THINGS ARE DAMAGED, 
AND WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYE ON 
THE DRIVEWAY CAMERA HERE, AND 
IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST SHOT, 
BUT WHAT IT DOES IT GIVES US A 
NARROW WINDOW AT A STAIRCASE 
LEADING INTO THE WEST WING, AND 
PEOPLE WHO ARE SOMETIMES 
VISITING COME THROUGH THAT 
DOOR, AND ALL WE ARE REALLY 
ABLE TO DO IS READ HALF A FACE 
OR SO OF THE PEOPLE COMING AND 
GOING, BUT YOU CAN'T PULL BACK 
FROM THE SHOT OR REALLY PAN 
EITHER WAY. 
THAT'S THE NARROW VIEW WE HAVE 
FROM THAT LOCATION. 
>> THE WHOLE WORLD IS LOOKING A 
THAT THE VIEW RIGHT NOW. 
>> CAITLIN, YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU 
WANTED TO JUMP IN BEFORE. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING. 
YOU SAID, AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY 
TRUE. 
FROM MUELLER'S PROSPECTIVE, 
FROM HIS PART, HE HAS BEEN 
ABSOLUTELY SILENT, NOT TALKING 
ABOUT IT AT ALL. 
ROSENSTEIN HAS TALKED ABOUT IT, 
GIVEN PUBLIC SPEECHES, OUT IN 
PUBLIC, TESTIFYING BEFORE 
CONGRESS, AND OF COURSE HE HAS 
BEEN, BECAUSE HE IS LEADING THE 
INVESTIGATION, OR OVERSEEING 
THE IN-- INVESTIGATION, HE'S ÃºB 
CONFERENCE, TALKING ABOUT THE 
INDICTMENTS, PUSHING FORWARD BY 
THE D.O.J. 
AS A RESULT OF THE PROBE. 
HE HAS, IN ALL APPEARANCES, AT 
LEAST TO ME, EXPRESSED A LEVEL 
OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN 
POSITION AND HIS OWN VIEW OF 
HOW THE MUELLER PROBE IS GOING. 
MY QUESTION THAT I WAS RAISING 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO, DOES 
THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING 
CHANGE ROSENSTEIN'S OWN VIEW OF 
HIS EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS? 
>> YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING 
THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION, 
AND I ALSO WONDER, AND WE KEEP 
TALKING ABOUT, WHAT DOES IT 
MEAN FOR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
INVESTIGATION IF THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL GOES, AND 
RIKKI, TO YOU, THERE'S SO MANY 
INVESTIGATIONS NOW BEING 
CONDUCTED, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT CONDUCTING AN 
INVESTIGATION, AND JUST BECAUSE 
THE PRESIDENT OR ONE OF THE -- 
WHOEVER THE PRESIDENT APPOINTS 
TO TAKE THE SPOT OF THE DEPUTY 
A.G. 
DECIDES TO SHUTDOWN THE MUELLER 
PROBE, IT DOES NOT MAKE THE 
INVESTIGATIONS GO AWAY, AND 
THERE MAY BE MORE FROM THE 
OTHER DISTRICT IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, FIRST 
OF ALL, WE HAVE TWO THAT ARE 
DONE WITH IN THE SENSE THAT 
THEY ARE NOT GOING AWAY. 
>> AND THE PRESIDENT HAS NO 
CONTROL OVER THOSE. 
>> NONE, AND THAT CONCERNS, AND 
THEY ARE UNDER ROBERT MUELLER, 
BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE, 
BECAUSE, PAUL MANAFORT HAS NOW 
PLEADED GUILTY, AND HE IS -- 
THAT'S NOT GOING BACK. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> AND THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR 
PAUL MANAFORT TO DO, CONTINUE 
TO COOPERATE, AND THEY HAVE 
ALREADY DEBRIEFED HIM FOR A 
LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND HE'S 
GETTING SENTENCED, AND I MEAN, 
I WOULD THINK PAUL MANAFORT HAS 
EVER REASON NOT TO WANT ROBERT 
MUELLER GO AWAY. 
HE HAS THE KEYS TO HIS FREEDOM 
OR AT LEAST TO A LESSER 
SENTENCE. 
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW 
YORK IS ON ITS OWN, DEALING 
WITH MICHAEL  COHAN AND 
WHATEVER FALLS OUT FROM THAT. 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE 
FOR THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAS 
GONE FORWARD WITH THE CIVIL 
SUIT AGAINST THE TRUMP 
FOUNDATION, WHICH THEN LED TO A 
REFERRAL FOR CRIMINAL REFERRAL 
TO THE I.R.S. 
AND THE FEDERAL ELECTION 
COMMISSION, AND SO, THOSE ARE 
GOING FORWARD, AND SO, NO, IT 
IS NOT GOING TO. 
AGAIN, THE QUOTE, END QUOTE, 
RUSSIAN COLLUSION 
INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD BE THE 
ONE WITH ROBERT MUELLER THAT 
COULD GO BY THE BOARDS, AND 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, AS IT 
CONCERNS, NOT ONLY THE 
POSSIBILITY OF LOOKING AT THE 
PRESIDENT, BUT THE PRESIDENT'S 
FAMILY. 
THOSE ARE, OF COURSE, THE MOST 
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DONALD 
TRUMP. 
>> HE TALKED ABOUT THAT. 
HE SAID THAT'S THE RED LINE. 
>> YEAH. 
>> AND WE HAVE GOT THIS SOUND 
BITE FROM JOHN DICKERSON 
INTERVIEWING TREY GOUTY 
YESTERDAY, AND LET'S PLAY A 
LITTLE BIT OF THAT. 
ED F YOU'RE STILL  -- ED, IF 
YOU'RE STILL WITH US, I WILL 
GET YOU TO  REACT. 
>> I'M SURE AT SOME POINT, THE 
PRESIDENT WILL SAY ROD, IF YOU 
THINK I'M INCOMPETENT F YOU 
FEEL THE NEED TO WEAR  -- IF 
YOU FEEL THE NEED TO WEAR A  
WIRE, WHY ARE YOU SERVING IN MY 
ADMINISTRATION. 
HE MAY SAY IT NEVER HAPPENED. 
LOOK AT THE McCABE MEMOS, FIND 
OUT WHO WAS IN THE ROOM, AND 
GIVE ROD A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN IF 
IT WAS TRUE, AND THE CONTEXT TO 
WHICH IT WAS SAID. 
ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR, A 
REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT 
PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT 
TO A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
WHO DOES NOT THINK YOU'RE 
INCOMPETENT AND DOESN'T FEEL 
THE NEED TO TAPE CONVERSATIONS 
WITH YOU. 
>> AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENT ABOUT HIS 
ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHEN ASKED IN 
HAVE AN  ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE GENERAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE? 
>> IT'S TERRIBLE. 
IT'S HEART BREAKING, AND I 
UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT'S 
FRUSTRATION, THE FRUSTRATION 
THAT HE PICKED, OUT OF ALL OF 
THE FRATERNITIES HE COULD HAVE 
PICKED, HE PICKED ONE THAT HAD 
TO REACCUSE HIMSELF FROM THE 
OFFICE'S MOST SIGNIFICANT 
INVESTIGATION, BUT HE DID PICK 
HIM. 
I WOULD PREFER THEY KEEP THEIR 
DIFFERENCES PRIVATE, AND 
THERE'S NOTHING TO KEEP THE 
PRESIDENT FROM BRINGING JEFF 
SESSIONS OVER AND HAVING A 
STERN CONVERSATION ABOUT 
PRIORITIES OR POLICIES, BUT THE 
PUBLIC FIGHTING TO ME, IT'S A 
DIFFERENT OFFICE, NOT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OR 
COMMERCE, IT'S A BLINDFOLDED 
WOMAN HOLDING SCALES THAT EACH 
OF US HAS TO HAVE CONVERSATION 
IN, AND IT IS SAD TO WATCH, 
QUITE FRANKLY. 
>> ED, YOU KNOW, TREY SAYING 
THE PRESIDENT COULD VERY WELL 
BRING HIM IN SAYING IF YOU FEEL 
I'M INCOMPETITION AND YOU FEEL 
THE NEED TO WEAR A WIRE WHY ARE 
YOU IN MY ADMINISTRATION? 
>> THAT'S A VALID POINT, 
EVERYONE SERVES IN A POLITICAL 
APPOINTED JOB SERVES AT THE 
PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT, NO 
MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS. 
SHOULD THEY HAVE CONCERNS OVER 
THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP OR 
SPEAK OUT IN A BRASH WAY, AND 
THEN HAVE IT REPORTED, IT'S 
GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL, AND IT 
SHOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYBODY. 
THE CONCERN HERE AS THE 
CONGRESSMAN SAID, IT'S A 
SENSITIVE PROJECT, SENSITIVE 
MISSION THAT ROSENSTEIN HAS 
BEEN TASKED WITH OVERSEEING FOR 
THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF OR SO, 
AND HIM GOING COULD POTENTIALLY 
UPSET THE CART. 
THIS HAS A REAL POTENTIAL TO 
UPEND A LOT OF THINGS. 
CHATTER ON TWITTER AND OTHER 
PLACES ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IT 
COULD REALLY UNDERMINE THE RULE 
OF LAW, AND IT COULD CREATE A 
POLITICAL CRISIS LIKE A 
SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE IN SLOW 
MOTION. 
WE WILL SEE WHAT TRANSPIRES 
HERE, BUT THERE'S THE CONCERN 
IN WASHINGTON AS WE WAIT AND 
SEE WHAT IS EXACTLY TRANSPIRING 
BEFORE US AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> THE OTHER THING HE SAID, ROD 
ROSENSTEIN DESERVES TO BE 
HEARD, AND I WONDER, YOU KNOW, 
WHAT THE FALLOUT COULD BE, IF 
THE PERCEPTION IS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS JUST WAITING FOR 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVER THAT THE 
NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE GAVE HIM 
TO GET RIM OF HIM. 
IF THAT'S THE WAY IT'S 
PERCEIVED, COULD WE SEE SOME 
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS PUSHING 
BACK IN A VERY SORT OF 
ASSERTIVE WAY AGAINST THE 
PRESIDENT? 
>> YOU COULD, TOTALLY, 
ABSOLUTELY. 
THERE'S BEEN REPUBLICANS WHO 
SAID IT, AND THERE'S 
REPUBLICANS WHO SAID IT 
PRIVATELY. 
SHOULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
TRANSPIRE, SHOULD THERE START 
TO BE A REARRANGEMENT OF THE 
DECK CHAIRS, IF YOU WILL AT THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, THEY WILL 
EXPRESS CONCERN, AND THEY MAY 
STEP IN WITH LEGISLATION TO 
SAVE GUARD THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
IF SENATORS LIKE THOM TILLIS 
AND BOB CORKIER HAVE BEEN 
INVOLVED, DEMOCRATS LIKE 
RICHARD BLOOMENNAL, THE -- 
BLOOMENTHAL. 
THE KEY IS ONE OTHER THING 
GOING ON IN WASHINGTON, LIKE WE 
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO TALK 
ABOUT, THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATION MESS, BUT GOVERNMENT 
FUNDING IS RUNNING OUT ON 
FRIDAY, AND THERE'S THE REAL 
POTENTIAL IF THERE'S NOT A 
QUICK AGREEMENT HERE F THE 
PRESIDENT  -- IF THE PRESIDENT 
DOESN'T PUT HIS SIGNATURE TO 
PAPER, YOU COULD SEE HOW IT ALL 
PLAYS OUT. 
THAT'S HANGING OVER ALL OF 
THIS. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT AGREED TO 
SEND THE TEMPORARY SPENDING 
AGREEMENT PUT IN PLACE. 
IF HE REJECTS IT FOR SOME 
REASON, THAT COULD CAUSE 
CALAMITY AND A POTENTIAL 
SHUTDOWN. 
I REALIZE THIS IS A MOMENT WE 
ARE SPECULATING. 
BECAUSE WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT 
WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND US, BUT 
IT'S FAST MOVING. 
MADE MORE TRICKY TODAY BY THE 
FACT THE PRESIDENT IS IN NEW 
YORK AND HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AND 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE 
HERE, AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHER 
THINGS PERCOLATING IN 
WASHINGTON AND ON THE GLOBAL 
STAGE IN NEW YORK THAT COULD 
COMPLICATE THIS MORE. 
THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT WANT TO 
BE SEEN AS VULNERABLE IN FRONT 
OF WORLD LEADERS THIS WEEK, AND 
BACK IN WASHINGTON, FACING 
OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATION AND POTENTIAL 
PROBLEMS WITH HIS SPENDING 
LEGISLATION, AND ALL OF THIS 
COMES AT TRICKY MOMENT FOR THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT AND EVERYONE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
>> IT'S INTERESTING ED, THAT 
YOU POINTED TO THE SATURDAY 
NIGHT MASSACRE IN SLOW MOTION, 
AND IF MY MEMORY SERVES 
CORRECTLY IT WAS OCTOBER 1973, 
JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AWAY 
FROM OCTOBER, AND TO REMIND 
VIEWERS, THAT'S WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
THEN RICHARD NIXON DECIDED TO 
FIRE ACHIBAL. 
MR.RICHARDSON DECLINED TO DO SO 
AND RESIGNED. 
HE ASKED THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL TO FIRE HIM, AND HE 
RESIGNED. 
HE APPOINTED ROBERT BORK WHO 
DID WHAT HE WANTED TO, AND YOU 
SAID EARLIER IF THE PRESIDENT, 
WE ALL SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, IF THERE IS CAUSE, THE 
SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE, NO 
CAUSE, IS THERE CAUSE HERE IF 
YOU'RE TRYING TO RELATE THE 
TWO? 
>> I THINK THAT IS UP TO 
DEBATE. 
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. 
I THINK, REALLY, CAITLIN HAD 
THE BEST PHRASE, YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT THE FACT IF THERE'S REAL 
CAUSE, AND WHAT IS IN THE MIND 
OF ROD ROSENSTEIN ABOUT HOW HE 
PERCEIVES HOW THIS IS BEING  
HEARD IN THE COUNTRY. 
DOES HE THINK IT MAKES HIM LESS 
EFFECTIVE? 
WHAT I DO SEE IN TERMS OF 
REPORTING BESIDES THE FACT I 
CAN SEE PAULA OUT OF THE CORNER 
OF MY EYE, AND I'M GOING TO GET 
A DEFINITIVE REVIEW, WITHIN 
MINUTES OF EACH OTHER, THE WALL 
STREET JOURNAL REPORTED THAT 
ROD ROSENSTEIN EXPECTED TO BE 
FIRED, NOT RESIGNING AS THE 
WASHINGTON POST REPORTED HE WAS 
RESIGNING, AND TALK ABOUT A 
WORLD OF SPECULATION, AND THAT 
BRINGS US BACK TO CAUSE. 
IS JOKING A CAUSE, OR DOES IT 
REALLY MEAN THE PRESIDENT CAN 
LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, WHETHER 
OR NOT YOU WERE JOKING, WHICH 
WAS INAPPROPRIATE, OR WHETHER 
OR NOT YOU WERE SERIOUS, IT 
MAKES YOU INEFFECTIVE TO HAVE 
THIS ROLE. 
>> UH-UH. 
RIGHT. 
>> SO, WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 
TO COVER THIS, AND WHAT YOU ARE 
SEEING RIGHT THERE, THE SHOT OF 
THE PARKING LOT WITH, WHAT YOU 
CANNOT TELL, IT'S THE VIEW OF 
THE ENTRANCE INTO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND WE ARE EXPECTING ROD 
ROSENSTEIN WILL GO TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND HE COULD BE THERE 
FOR ALL WE KNOW, BUT THIS IS 
THE BEST -- THIS IS OUR BEST 
GUESS, IF HE WAS COMING, THIS 
IS WHERE HE IS COMING IN AND 
OUT OF. 
THE REPORTING, THERE'S A 
POSSIBILITY THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN 
COULD BE FIRED OR RESIGN, AND 
THAT'S ACCORDING TO AXIOS, BUT 
THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY 
HE'S GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, PERHAPS 
A CUP OF TEA. 
WE DON'T KNOW. 
>> OR A STERN TONGUE LASHING. 
>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK 
AND CONTINUE TO COVER THIS. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, CBS 
NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE GOT A 
CAMERA TRAINED ON AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE WHERE WE EXPECT, OR WE 
HOPE AT LEAST, WE WILL SEE OR 
CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, ACCORDING TO ALL 
SOURCES, HE'S ON HIS WAY TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND HE'S BEEN 
SUMMONED THERE. 
FOR WHAT, WE DO NOT EXACTLY 
KNOW. 
IT'S BEEN SPECULATED HE IS 
GOING TO RESIGN, OR HE MAY BE 
FIRED, BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF, 
JOHN KELLY. 
WE DON'T KNOW, BUT WE HAVE 
PAULA REID JOINING US AT THE 
TABLE, AND PAULA IS WORKING HER 
SOURCES. 
>> I'M LITERALLY ON MY PHONE 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> SHE'S WORKING SOURCES, AND 
ALSO CAITLIN HUEY BURNS. 
>> WE KNOW ROD ROSENSTEIN IS 
ATTENDING A PREVIOUSLY 
SCHEDULED MEETING IN HIS 
OFFICIAL CAPACITY AT DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE QUESTION 
IS, HAS HE HAD THE BIG TALK 
YET? 
THEY HAD IT AND THINGS ARE 
PENDING? 
OR IT WENT WELL? 
RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE KNOW, 
CONFIRMED FROM SOURCE AT THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, HE WENT TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY, 
EXPECTING TO BE FIRED, AND 
WHILE WE HAVE NOT SEEN HIM, 
SOURCES ARE CONFIRMING HE'S AT 
A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED MEETING 
IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY. 
>> HE'S AT THE WHITE HOUSE? 
>> APPEARS RIGHT NOW, HE'S AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE IN A PREVIOUSLY 
SCHEDULED MEETING IN HIS 
OFFICIAL CAPACITY. 
SOURCES IN THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT CONFIRMING HE'S 
STILL THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 
GENERAL AT THE MOMENT. 
>> WE ALSO KNOW THIS SHOT IS 
USELESS TO US. 
WE HAVE HAD IT UP THERE FOR 
LIKE AN HOUR. 
>> DIDN'T REALLY THINK HE WAS 
GOING TO COME WITH ALL THE 
CAMERAS THERE, JUST STROLLING 
BY EVERYONE'S CAMERA, WAVE 
TOGETHER CAMERAS MAKING HIS 
WAY. 
>> MORE DETAILS, APPARENTLY A 
CABINET LEVEL MEETING, FILLING 
IN FOR JEFF SESSIONS, WHO IS 
COMING BACK FROM A SPEECH ON 
OPIOID THE, -- OPIOIDS, AND 
HE'S FILLING IN RIGHT NOW. 
THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO 
VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
SOMETIMES WE GET EXCITED WHEN 
HE IS SPOTTED BY CAMERAS, BUT 
HE'S THERE TWICE A WEEK. 
TODAY, IT'S AN ENORMOUS 
SIGNIFICANT. 
HE'S AT LEAST ATTENDING 
MEETINGS RIGHT NOW IN HIS 
OFFICIAL CAPACITY. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
REPORTING HE WAS EXPECTED TO BE 
FIRED OR LET GO. 
>> WOULDN'T YOU IF YOU WERE 
HIM, WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT? 
>> YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. 
NOT JUST FROM THE REPORTING WE 
SAW ABOUT THE 5th AMENDMENT, 
BUT RECENTLY, ALSO, THE TWEETS, 
AND THE INCREASED ATTACKS HE 
HAS BEEN SORT OF ENDURING, AND 
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY HE 
WOULD THINK HE COULD GET FIRED 
NOW. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT THIS, BUT THE PRESIDENT 
DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HERALDO, 
RIVERA. 
>> WE DID. 
>> 2 DAYS AGO, BEFORE THE NEWS, 
THE PRESIDENT MAKES REFERENCE 
TO THIS, BUT HE DIDN'T DO A 
FULL DEFENSE OF THE DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
HE SAID IT'S A SAD STATE OF 
AFFAIRS WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 
LET'S CIRCLE BACK TO THE 
ALLEGATION, WHAT DO THEY 
ALLEGATION HAPPENED? 
>> THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING 
THAT ROD ROSEN STEIN SUGGESTED 
IN MAY 2017, WIRETAPPING OR 
RECORDING CONVERSATIONS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT. 
I SPOKE TO SOURCES IN THE 
MEETING, AND THEY SAID, YES, HE 
DID SAY THIS, BUT IT WAS A 
JOKE, AND ANYONE WHO TALKS TO 
ROD ROSENSTEIN KNOWS HE MAKES A 
LOT OF JOKES. 
>> RIKK I  KLIEMAN SAID THE 
SAME THING. 
WE CALL THEM DAD JOKES. 
HE LOOKS AROUND TO MAKE SURE 
EVERYONE IS COMFORTABLE AND 
GIGGLING A LOT. 
THE OTHER SUGGESTION IS HE HAD 
REFERENCE USING THE 25th 
AMENDMENT TO OUST THE 
PRESIDENT, AND NO ONE I HAVE 
SPOKE WITH, I SPOKE TO HALF A 
DOZEN SOURCES, AND NO ONE HEARD 
THAT BEING SAID. 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE IN 
ORDER TO GO ALONG WITH THAT IS 
THAT ROSENSTEIN THOUGHT HE 
COULD GET TWO-THIRDS OF 
CONGRESS TO OUST THE PRESIDENT 
IN MAY OF 2017. 
>> IN THE WAKE OF FIRING OF 
JAMES COMEY WHICH HE ATTACHED 
HIS NAME. 
THE THING, THE TIMES ALSO 
REPORTED THAT ROSENSTEIN 
BELIEVED SESSIONS WOULD GO WITH 
THE EFFORT TO OUST THE 
PRESIDENT, AND ROD ROSENSTEIN 
IS A VERY SMART MAN, CAREFUL 
MAN, AND IT JUST DEFIES LOGIC 
THAT BACK IN MAY OF 2017 THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED 
STATES, HIS FIRST SENATOR TO 
COME OUT AND SUPPORT CANDIDATE 
DONALD TRUMP, A SMART MAN IN 
THE SENATE FOR DECADES, WOULD 
BELIEVE AN EFFORT LIKE THAT 
WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. 
PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME, WHY 
DOESN'T THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
RESIGN? 
WHY IS HE STILL IN OFFICE? 
EVEN IF HE DISAGREES WITH THE 
PRESIDENT, HE BELIEVE IN THE 
PLATFORM, AND HE BELIEVES IN 
THE AGENDA. 
THAT'S WHY HE WORKS DAY IN AND 
DAY OUT TO EXECUTE THAT. 
THE IDEA HE THOUGHT HE WOULD GO 
WITH THE 25th AMENDMENT, THAT 
JUST DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. 
>> HE WAS NOT BEING TORCHED BY 
THE PRESIDENT ON A CONSISTENT 
BASIS. 
>> NOTHING LIKE THAT. 
>> TO THE LATEST REPORTING HE 
HAD THE IDEA HE COULD BE FIRED, 
IS THERE -- DOES THAT RING TRUE 
TO YOU? 
>> THE QUESTION IS, WHY DID 
THESE MEMOS SURFACE ON FRIDAY? 
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM? 
I REPORTED IT OUT FROM HALF A 
DOZEN SOURCES. 
YES, THE COMMENTS WERE MADE, 
BUT THE INTERPRETATION BY THE 
SOURCES IN THE ROOM WAS 
DIFFERENT. 
THE NEW YORK TIMES WENT WITH 
THEM SAYING THEY SPOKE TO 
ANONYMOUS SOURCES WHO BELIEVED 
IT WAS A LEGITIMATE, SERIOUS 
ACCUSATION TO RECORD THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THEY SAID IT'S NOT A LEAK, 
THEY SAID THEY HAVE BEEN 
REPORTING ON THIS FOR A YEAR. 
PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONED THEIR 
REPORTING, AND THEY SAID -- 
>> THEY HAVE COME UNDER 
CONSIDERABLE SCRUTINY. 
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THE MEETING, AND IT'S NOT TOO 
HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS IN 
THE MEETING, WHO IS WORKING FOR 
ROD ROSENSTEIN AT THAT TIME? 
WHO IS WORKING THE FBI AT THAT 
TIME? 
PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS WHY THE 
NEW YORK TIMES, TWO FANTASTIC 
REPORTERS, GOLDMAN AND SCHMITT, 
WHY THEY WOULD RELY ON THE 
ANONYMOUS SOURCES FOR SOMETHING 
THAT COULD SET THE PRESIDENT 
OFF, RESULTING UNTIL THE FIRING 
OF ROSENSTEIN. 
THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS PEOPLE 
HAVE MATCHED IT BUT MYSELF 
INCLUDED, WE MATCHED THE 
COMMENT WAS MADE, BUT MY 
SOURCES SAID IT WAS A SARCASTIC 
STONE, AND ROD ROSENSTEIN MAY 
KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING BEHIND 
THE SCENES, AND PERHAPS THERE'S 
A PUSH TO OUST HIM, AND INSTEAD 
OF BEING FIRED HE WANTS TO 
RESIGN, BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY 
TODAY. 
>> ANYTHING IN THE REPORTING 
THAT SIGNALED TO YOU AND YOUR 
OWN REPORTING THAT ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, WE HAVE SEEN HIM 
MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS, AND 
HE'S GIVEN SPEECHES, AND HE'S 
EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE IN HIS 
POSITION AND IN THE MUELLER 
PROBE ITSELF, AND WAS THERE 
ANYTHING IN THAT REPORTING OR 
YOUR REPORTING THAT SIGNALED TO 
YOU, MAYBE HIS FRAME OF MIND, 
HE FELT, PERHAPS HE WAS 
COMPROMISED IN TERMS OF THE 
RUNNING THE INVESTIGATION, IN 
TERMS OF HIS OWN ABILITY TO 
OVERSEE THE INVESTIGATION? 
>> PEOPLE IN THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT ARE SHOCKED BECAUSE 
HE CAME OUT WITH THE DENIAL ON 
FRIDAY, SAYING IT'S ABSOLUTELY 
NOT TRUE. 
HE COULD HAVE SAID NO COMMENT, 
BUT IT WAS TWO DIFFERENT 
STATEMENTS. 
>> ONE SORT OF ALIKE, AND THEN 
ONE MUCH STRONGER WORDED. 
>> ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE 25th 
AMENDMENT ISSUE, AND IT'S NOT 
CLEAR WHAT TRANSPIRED FROM 
FRIDAY TO NOW TO MAKE HIM GO TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE BELIEVING HE 
WOULD BE FIRED. 
WE MAY GET TO THE END OF THE 
DAY AND REALIZE IT WAS ALL 
SEMATICS AND HE HAD TO GO TO 
THE MEETING, AND HE EXPECTED TO 
BE CANNED AFTER THE MEETING AND 
IT GOT OUT OF CONTROL, BUT WHAT 
I WAS TOLD FROM THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT, ABOUT 2 HOURS AGO, 
HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND HE EXPECTED TO BE 
FIRED. 
>> THAT IS JUST -- I'M 
CONCERNED ABOUT OURSELVES AND 
OUR OWN REPORTING. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE 
ANYTHING, BUT IT WOULD BE A 
BOMB IF HE WAS TO RESIGN OR TO 
BE LET GO, AND WE TALK ABOUT 
HOW THAT BOMB WOULD 
REVERBERATE, NOT JUST WITH THE 
MULLER INVESTIGATION, EVEN IF 
THE MULLER INVESTIGATION IS 
CHUGGING ALONG, UNTOUCHED, IT'S 
THE PERCEPTION THAT CAN BE 
ALMOST THE MOST DAMAGING, NOT 
JUST FOR THE MULLER 
INVESTIGATION AND WHETHER OR 
NOT THEY ARE BEHIND THE SCENES, 
BEING PRESSURED TO SHUT IT 
DOWN, BUT ALSO FOR THE UPCOMING 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, AND THE 
PERCEPTION OF THE PRESIDENT, 
WHO IS SAT THE U.N., TRYING TO 
LOOK PRESIDENTIAL. 
>> IN FRONT OF ALL THE WORLD. 
>> RIGHT, TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT 
THE Ws HE HAS, AND YOU KNOW, 
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT 
NORTH KOREA, I THINK THERE'S 
DEFINITELY MORE PROGRESS THERE 
THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN A VERY 
LONG TIME, AND NOW THERE'S A 
MASSIVE DISTRACTION THAT WE 
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH 
SUBSTANCE THERE IS TO IT. 
>> IF YOU'RE A WORLD LEADER, 
ARE YOU NEGOTIATING WITH THE 
PERSON WHO YOU THINK BECAUSE OF 
WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING ACROSS 
YOUR CABINET, YOUR GOVERNMENT 
EVERY SINGLE DAY, YOU'RE 
SITTING IN FRONT OF IN A YEAR? 
>> THAT WAS MY POLITICAL 
INTEREST, WHY NOW? 
THAT IS WHY I'M INTERESTED IN 
WHO STARTED THE CONVERSATION, 
AND IT WOULD NOT BE IN THE 
POLITICAL INTEREST OF THE 
PRESIDENT TO DO THIS NOW, AND 
NOT ONLY IS HE APPEARING BEFORE 
WORLD LEADERS, WANTING TO EXERT 
HIS INFLUENCE ON THE NATIONAL 
STAGE, HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
SUPREME COURT FIGHT, WITH MORE 
REPORTING COMING OUT YESTERDAY 
RAISING MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
KAVANAUGH. 
VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR, AND 
THAT WOULD BE HIS SUPREME 
COURT, HIS CORE ACHIEVEMENT AND 
SELLING POINT INTO THE MIDTERM, 
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS WONDERING 
WHO INITIATED THE CONVERSATION. 
IT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE IN 
THE INTEREST OF THE PRESIDENT 
TO START THIS NOW. 
>> PAULA, YOU'RE CHATTING WITH 
SOURCES AS WE ARE TALKING, BUT 
THE REPORTING OUT THERE SEEMS 
TO SUGGEST, BECAUSE THE WAY THE 
PRESIDENT HAS REACTED OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, AND YOU 
KNOW, NUMEROUS OUTLETS HAVE 
REPORTED THIS, HE IS QUOTE AT 
WAR WITH THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
DO THE CAREER OFFICIALS YOU 
SPEAK TO, THE CAREER MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO SERVE IN THE JUSTICE  
IS AT WAR WITH THEM? 
>> HE'S CERTAINLY NOT 
SUPPORTIVE. 
SAYING THE  FBI IS IN TATTERED, 
IN FRIDAY IN MISSOURI HE TALKED 
ABOUT THE STENCH FROM THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
THE FBI IS PART OF THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT, AND HE ROUTINELY 
CRITICIZES HIS OWN ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, AND I THINK ABSOLUTELY 
THE PEOPLE IN THE RANK AND FILE 
DO NOT FEEL SUPPORTED. 
>> SO, AND IT'S INTERESTING TO 
ME. 
WE HAD DAN SENIOR ON HERE, AND 
I ASKED IF HE THOUGHT 
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE ASSOCIATED 
WITH ATTACKS ON THE FBI AND THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY 
OFTEN SAY WE ARE NOT TALKING 
ABOUT THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE 
FRONT LINES, BUT IS THERE A 
KISS TINGS? 
-- DISTINCTION? 
IT AFFECTS EVERYBODY? 
>> IT DOES AFFECT EVERYBODY. 
DAVID WORKED FOR THE FBI, AND 
NOT FOCUSED ON RUSSIA, THAT'S A 
TINY, MINUSCULE PART OF THE 
WORK THEY ARE DOING, DAY IN AND 
DAY OUT WORKING TO PROTECT US 
FROM INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
THREATS, AND CYBER THREATS, THE 
THREAT FROM CHINA, AND THERE'S 
SO MANY FRONTS THEY WORK ON DAY 
IN AND DAY OUT TO MAKE THE 
COUNTRY SAFE. 
ABSOLUTELY THEY MAKE MISTAKES, 
BUT PEOPLE LIKE PETER AND LISA, 
IN THE TEXT MESSAGES THEY 
EXCHANGED, AND THAT IS A 
PROBLEM. 
THAT IS NOT A GREAT  OPTIC FOR 
THE FBI, AND PEOPLE WITH A 
POLITICAL SKIN SEIZED ON THAT 
SAYING LOOK AT THE TEXT 
MESSAGES, CAN YOU BELIEVE THE 
THINGS THAT PETER STRUCK, 
INVOLVED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON 
INVESTIGATION, IS SAYING ABOUT 
THE PRESIDENT, THEN CANDIDATE,  
THERE'S LIKE 1,000 OTHER TEXT 
MESSAGES, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE 
ANYTHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT 
ANYBODY, BUT YOU CANNOT 
DISCREDIT THE FACT HE WAS 
INVOLVE IN THE TWO POLITICALLY 
SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS SAYING 
TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT CANDIDATE 
TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS. 
YOU CAN SEE WHY SOME PEOPLE WHY 
WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THAT AND 
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO POLITICAL 
BIAS. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE 
TRANSPARENT AND HOLD THEM TO A 
HIGH STANDARD, BUT IT'S NOT 
GREAT FOR MORAL. 
>> WE HAVE ED O'KEEFE BACK IN 
FRONT OF THE CAMERA AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND WE ARE GOING 
TO GET TO SOME OTHER NEWS, BUT 
WE WILL ASK OUR COMMENTATORS 
AND REPORTS TO JUST GIVE US 
THEIR FINAL THOUGHTS. 
ED, HAVE YOU HEARD FROM ANY 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AT ALL IN 
THE WAKE OF THE NEWS? 
>> Reporter: I CHECKED WITH 
SEVERAL, AND THEY SAID THEY 
WERE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
TRANSPIRED WHETHER OR NOT 
ROSENSTEIN WAS BEING DISMISSED 
OR NOT. 
GIVEN PAULA'S EXCELLENT 
REPORTING IT'S A PREVIOUSLY 
SCHEDULED AFFAIR, NOT KICKED 
OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION, IT 
SEEMS ALL STATUS IS NORMAL, AND 
WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER DAY 
OR HOUR OF THIS DAY TO SEE IF 
ROSENSTEIN IS GETTING 
DISMISSED. 
>> HAS ANYONE EXPRESSED 
EXHAUSTION? 
I MEAN I KNOW JUST SITTING AT 
THE ANCHOR DESK -- WHAT IS 
GOING ON OVER THERE? 
WE CAN HEAR ALL SORTS OF NOISES 
BACK THERE. 
>> IT'S A TEST OF THE EMERGENCY 
BROADCAST SYSTEM, ANNE-MARIE. 
>> PERFECT TIMING. 
>> ALWAYS PERFECT TIMING. 
>> ABSOLUTELY PERFECT TIMING. 
I WAS WONDERING IF THE 
LAWMAKERS HAVE EXPRESSED AN 
EXASPERATION, IN THE MIDDLE THE 
OF THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION, 
THAT HAS BECOME INTENSE AND 
BIZARRE, WE HAVE THIS OTHER 
THING POPPING UP. 
>> Reporter: RIGHT, I THINK YOU 
WERE SAYING EVERYONE IS TIRED, 
AND IT'S ONLY MONDAY. 
 
>> THERE IT GOES AGAIN. 
YEAH, -- CAN'T THEY -- OH. 
>> YEAH, MAYBE WE SHOULD PULL 
AWAY FROM ED O'KEEFE. 
>> IT'S GREAT TO KNOW IT WORKS. 
>> I FEEL LIKE ED NEEDS TO 
PRESERVE HIS OWN HEARING. 
IF IT'S LOUD TO US, IT MUST BE 
REALLY LOUD TO HIM. 
ED, I'M GOING TO PIVOT AWAY 
FROM YOU. 
>> Reporter: I'M STILL HERE. 
HOLD ON! 
I THINK IT'S OVER, IF IT'S 
OVER, BLOW THROUGH IT. 
PEOPLE ARE EXHAUSTED. 
IT WAS A LONG WEEKEND, TOO, 
BECAUSE, REMEMBER, YOU HAD THE 
ALLEGATIONS SURFACE AGAINST 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND YOU HAD 
THE LINGERING CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE REPORTING ON FRIDAY, AND 
THIS IS EVERYDAY NOW IN 
WASHINGTON, AND WE ARE ALL 
ACCUSTOMED TO IT, AND EVERYONE 
OVER ON CAPITOL HILL, ALWAYS 
SORT OF PREPARED FOR SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN, AND IT HAS 
NOT HAPPENED, AT LEAST NOT AS 
OF 12:38 EASTERN TIME, AND YOU 
KNOW, WE WILL SEE WHETHER IT 
TRANSPIRES LATER IN THE DAY. 
FOR NOW, AT LEAST, WE KNOW THAT 
ROSENSTEIN STILL HAS A JOB, AND 
EVERYTHING DESPITE THE TEST YOU 
JUST HEARD IS STATUS NORMAL. 
>> THAT IS NOT AN EMERGENCY. 
>> I FEEL LIKE THE TEST IS A 
METAPHOR FOR THE NEWS MEDIA. 
WE GOT EXCITED,. 
>> Reporter: WORKED UP ABOUT 
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 
HAPPENING? 
YEAH. 
>> EVEN IF ROSENSTEIN IS NOT 
FIRED OR RESIGN TODAY, I THINK 
THE QUESTION GOES BACK TO 
CAPITOL HILL TO LAWMAKERS TO 
ASK, YOU KNOW, WHETHER THEY DO 
FEEL AN INCENTIVE TO THE FLOOR. 
THERE'S BEEN TALK OF IT FOR A 
YEAR, BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN 
HYPOTHETICAL, TODAY IT COULD 
VERY WELL BE HYPOTHETICAL, BUT 
SHOULD THERE BE PARAMETERS PUT 
IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE 
PROTECTION OF THIS? 
>> EVERY TIME WE HAVE HAD A 
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION, THE 
PARAMETERS OF THAT HAVE BEEN 
TWEAKED, AND EVERY TIME, AS WE 
MOVED FORWARD, THE NEW 
INCARNATION IS REALLY AN 
EXPERIMENT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS 
UNDER THE NEW PRESSURES, YOU 
KNOW? 
>> Reporter: RIGHT, AND THAT'S 
WHY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF, 
YOU KNOW, YOU BEEN HEARING A 
LOT FROM THE REPUBLICAN ALLIES 
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND FROM THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF, CALLING IT 
ILLEGAL. ÃºIT'S NOT ILLEGAL, AND 
HAVE BEEN INSTANCES, AND PAULA 
CAN SPEAK TO IT BETTER THAN I 
CAN, BUT THERE'S THE CONCERN 
THE PROBE HAS THE MANDATE TO 
GROW AND GO WHEREVER THE 
INVESTIGATION MAY LEAD. 
THAT HAS, OF COURSE, BEEN THE 
OVERARCHING CONCERN FROM A 
POLITICAL FRONT, KNOWING IT'S 
POSSIBLE. 
>> THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN THE 
REACTION TO THE PROBES THAT 
WERE TOO LIMITED IN THEIR 
SCOPE. 
YOU COULD NOT GO BEYOND THAT. 
NOW WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, 
SOMETHING THAT IS ABLE TO SPORT 
OF SPRAWL, AND IT HAS, I MEAN 
IN TERMS OF THE MUELLER 
SUCCESSES SO FAR, HAVE HAD 
NOTHING TO DO WITH COLLUSION AT 
THIS POINT. 
>> IT'S ALSO NOT BEEN A WITCH 
HUNT, AND THAT'S THE QUESTION I 
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL 
GOING TO HAVE, AND YOU RAISED 
AN EXCELLENT POINT, IF AT ANY 
POINT IN TIME THE MEDIA AND 
OTHERS RECKLESSLY REPORT WHAT 
IS HAPPENING WITH THE PERSON 
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ELECTION, WHY NOT INTRODUCE A 
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT 
REMOVES THE DOUBT AND REMOVES 
ALL QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR 
NOT IT WILL PROCEED, NO MATTER 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT TWEETS OR 
WHAT HE SAYS. 
FINALLY TO YOU PAULA, IF THIS, 
IF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
RESIGNS OR IS FIRED OR 
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM, WHO 
GETS THAT INVESTIGATION? 
WE HAVE OFTEN -- AND THIS IS A 
QUESTION WE ASKED RIKKI 
KLIEMAN, THERE'S OTHER 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WILL 
CONTINUE, WHETHER OR NOT ROBERT 
MUELLER IS IN HIS JOB. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. 
I WILL GIVE YOU FRESH 
REPORTING, AND THEN WE WILL GO 
TO THE LINE OF SUCCESSION. 
I AM TOLD THAT PRIOR TO THIS 
MEETING THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN IS 
IN, HE DID MEET WITH GENERAL 
KELLY -- 
>> PRIOR? 
>> YES, AND HE'S CURRENTLY AT A 
PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED MEETING AS 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND I 
SAID DOES THIS MEAN HE'S NOT 
FIRED OR IS THERE A COMMITTEE 
MEETING, AND ALL JUSTICE 
OFFICIALS SAY HE IS STILL THE 
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
GOOD TIME, BUT I THINK WE CAN 
TELL FROM THIS MORNING, HIS JOB 
STATUS IS PERHAPS NOT 100% 
SECURE, NOR IS IT EVER. 
>> CHECK THE TIME STAMP, 12:42. 
>> THAT'S THE BEST INFORMATION 
FROM INSIDE OF THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
NOW IF ROD ROSENSTEIN SHOULD NO 
LONGER BE EMPLOYED BY THE END 
OF THE DAY, THE BIG QUESTION, 
WHO TAKING OVER THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION? 
TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON THIS 
RIGHT NOW. 
ONE, GO THROUGH THE LINE OF 
SUCCESSION AT THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
THERE'S ALWAYS THE CONCERN AN 
OFFICIAL COULD DIE OR THE 
NUMBER THREE PERSON WENT TO WAL-
MART. 
WHO TAKES OVER? 
IT WOULD FALL TO NOAH 
FRANCISCO. 
PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE RESIGNED, AND 
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF HEADS OF 
DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN 
CONFIRMED. 
THAT'S UNUSUAL IN THAT SENSE, 
BUT FRANCISCO WOULD BE EXPECTED 
TO TAKE IT OVER. 
>> HE'S BEEN CONFIRMED? 
>> HE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, AND 
HE IS QUITE THE CHARACTER, 
BRILLIANT LEGAL CAREER, AND WE 
HAVE ASKED HIM NUMEROUS TIMES 
IF HE WOULD FIRE MUELLER. 
HE ALWAYS CHOOSES TO IGNORE MY 
QUESTIONS, AND HE WOULD BE THE 
ONE EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER, BUT 
A CAVEAT HERE, PEOPLE SUGGEST 
TODAY THE PRESIDENT COULD TRY 
TO USE THE VACANCIES REFORM ACT 
TO NAME HIS SUCCESSOR, BUT 
OTHERS SAY NO WAY, THE 
VACANCIES REFORM ACT WAS NOT 
MEANT FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES TO REPLACE 
SOMEONE OVERSEEING AN 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
PRESIDENT AND HIS ASSOCIATES, 
AND IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY, IF HE 
DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE LINE OF 
SUCCESSION, IT WOULD SET OFF A 
LEGAL CHALLENGE. 
>> I LOVE OUR REPORTERS, AND 
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR -- I 
MEAN, IT'S MIND BLOWING THAT 
PAULA IS SITTING HERE, ON THE 
AIR TALKING ABOUT THE DEEP 
LEGAL ISSUES AND HAVING 
CONVERSATIONS WITH FIVE SOURCES 
ALL AT ONCE, AND CAITLIN, ED, 
RIKKI, WE APPRECIATE YOU SO 
MUCH FOR HELPING US GET THROUGH 
THIS. 
WE REALLY DEFER TO YOU. 
>> WE WOULD BE LOST. 
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT 
DIRECTIONS HERE. 
IT'S FANTASTIC. 
>>> SPEAKING OF SO MANY 
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, THERE'S 
MORE NEWS, AND WE WILL SHOW YOU 
WHAT IS HAPPENING ON CAPITOL 
HILL RIGHT NOW. 
BECAUSE, AMIDST ALL OF THIS, WE 
ARE STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS ON THURSDAY WITH THE 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, AND THIS IS A 
PROTEST HAPPENING LIVE AS WE 
SPEAK, AND IT LOOKS LIKE, IT 
LOOKS LIKE AN OLDER WOMAN WHO 
HAS GOT BINDERS ON HER WRIST, I 
GUESS BEING DETAINED. 
>> IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TODAY 
WE WERE GOING TO HEAR FROM 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD, 
AND THEN IT WAS PUSHED BACK TO 
THURSDAY, AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHO 
KNOWS, PERHAPS THE PROTESTERS 
THOUGHT THEY WERE PROTESTING IN 
THE MIDST OF THE KAVANAUGH 
HEARING, GOODNESS KNOWS WE SAW 
A NUMBER OF PROTESTERS WHEN HIS 
HEARING FIRST BEGAN. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, MEANWHILE, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL 
DEFENDING BRETT KAVANAUGH AMID 
THE NEW SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
ALLEGATIONS. 
>> HE WEIGHED IN ON THE 
CONTROVERSY ARRIVING IN NEW 
YORK CITY TO ATTEND THE UNITED 
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
>> HE IS A FINE MAN WITH AN 
UNBLEMISHED  PAST, AND THESE 
ARE HIGHLY UNSUBSTANTIATED 
ALLEGATIONS FROM LAWYERS, AND 
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE 
LAWYERS DOING THE ALLEGATIONS, 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS AN 
OUTSTANDING PERSON, AND I AM 
WITH HIM ALL THE WAY. 
WE WILL SEE HOW IT GOES WITH 
THE SENATE AND THE VOTE. 
I THINK IT COULD BE -- THERE'S 
A CHANCE IT COULD BE ONE OF THE 
SINGLE MOST UNFAIR, UNJUST 
THINGS TO HAPPEN TO A CANDIDATE 
FOR ANYTHING, BUT I AM WITH 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AND I LOOK 
FORWARD TO A VOTE, AND FOR 
PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF THE 
WOODWORKS FROM 36 YEARS AGO, 30 
YEARS AGO, AND NEVER MENTION IT 
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT HAPPENS? 
IN MY OPINION, IT'S TOTALLY 
POLITICAL. 
IT'S TOTALLY POLITICAL. 
>> ALL RIGHT, AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS COME AFTER 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ TOLD THE NEW 
YORKER MR. KAVANAUGH EXPOSED 
HIMSELF TO HER IN THE 1980s, 
ALLEGEDLY WHEN THEY WERE 
CLASSMATES AT YALE. 
KAVANAUGH'S OTHER ACCUSER, AND 
THERE'S SEVERAL, CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD WILL TESTIFY BEFORE 
CONGRESS ABOUT HER CLAIM HE 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER WHEN 
THEY WERE TEENAGERS. 
>> WE LEARNED THERE'S A THIRD 
WOMAN ACCUSING KAVANAUGH OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, AND HER 
LAWYER IS STORMY DANIEL'S 
ATTORNEY, MICHAEL AVENATTI. 
HE SAID HIS CLIENT WILL GO 
PUBLIC LATER THIS WEEK. 
>> Reporter: DEBORAH RAMIREZ 
LIVES IN COLORADO AND HAS 
WORKED WITH VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE. 
ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORKER 
ARTICLE WHEN THEY WERE FIRST 
YEAR STUDENTS AT YALE HE, 
QUOTE, EXPOSED HIMSELF AT A 
DRUNKEN DORMITORY PARTY, THRUST 
HIS IN HER FACE AND CAUSED HER 
TO TOUCH IT WITHOUT HER CONSENT 
AS SHE PUSHED AWAY. 
RAMIREZ ADMITS HER MEMORIES 
CONTAINED GAPS BECAUSE SHE HAD 
BEEN DRINKING AT THE TIME OF 
THE ALLEGED INCIDENT, BUT SOME 
OF HER CLASSMATES CONFIRMED TO 
RONAN FARROW AND JANE MAYER 
THEY WERE TOLD ABOUT IT. 
KAVANAUGH SAID THE ALLEGED 
EVENT FROM 35 YEARS AGO DID NOT 
HAPPEN. 
THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW ME THEN 
SAID IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 
DIANE FEINSTEIN IS CALLING FOR 
THE THURSDAY MEETING TO BE 
CANCELED, AND OTHERS ARE 
CALLING ON KAVANAUGH TO 
WITHDRAW SAYING IT'S TIME FOR A 
NEW NOMINEE. 
REPUBLICANS LAYING LOW. 
THEY HAD BEEN PUSHING FOR A 
QUICK CONFIRMATION JUST A FEW 
HOURS EARLIER. 
>> UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING 
MORE, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO RUIN 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S LIFE OVER 
THIS. 
>> Reporter: THIS WAS VICE 
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON 
SATURDAY. 
>> I BELIEVE THAT JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WILL SOON BE JUSTICE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND TAKE HIS 
SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT. 
>> Reporter: AS FOR FORD, 
KAVANAUGH'S FIRST ACCUSER -- 
>> I BELIEVE HER COMPLETELY. 
>> Reporter: FORD'S SISTER-IN-
LAW SAYS IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME, 
BUT SHE'S PREPARED TO TESTIFY. 
>> FACTS MATTER TO HER, AND 
SHE'S BEING CAREFUL TO MAKE 
SURE THE PROCESS WILL BE FAIR, 
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO 
MUCH TO ASK. 
>> AND CBS NEWS CHIEF 
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, 
NANCY CORDES IS WITH US FROM 
CAPITOL HILL. 
HOW WILL THE NEW ALLEGATIONS 
AFFECT THE THURSDAY SCHEDULED 
MEETING WITH KAVANAUGH AND 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD? 
>> Reporter: EXCELLENT 
QUESTION, VLAD. 
WE KNOW SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE ARGUING THAT THE HEARING 
SHOULD BE DELAYED, AND WE KNOW 
FOR DAYS THEY WERE CALLING FOR 
AN FBI INVESTIGATION, AND THE 
CALLS DROPPED OFF SOMEWHAT 
BECAUSE THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY 
HITTING A BRICK WALL, AND THE 
WHITE HOUSE WOULD NOT ASK THE 
FBI TO DO AN INVESTIGATION, AND 
NOW THERE'S A SECOND POTENTIAL 
VICTIM HERE, AND THE CALLS ARE 
BEING DRUMMED UP AGAIN, AND SO, 
THEY SAY, LOOK, YOU HAVE GOT 
TWO WOMEN, AND THEY ARE, OF 
COURSE, ALLEGATIONS ABOUT 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED 35 YEARS 
AGO, YES, MEMORIES ARE SPOTTY, 
BUT CLEARLY THE FBI NEEDS TO 
LOOK INTO THIS. 
IN FACT, RAMIREZ SAID HERSELF, 
SHE THINKS THE FBI SHOULD LOOK 
INTO IT. 
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
SAYING. 
PUSH OFF FORD'S HEARING ON 
THURSDAY, AND LOOK INTO THE 
ALLEGATIONS, AND SO FAR WE HAVE 
NOT HEARD MUCH OF A RESPONSE 
FROM THE REPUBLICANS, AND THEY 
HAVE BEEN QUITE  QUIET. 
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT SOME OF 
THEM ARE WATCHING TO SEE IF 
KAVANAUGH CAN WEATHER THE 
STORM. 
OTHERS PERHAPS WANT TO MEET 
TODAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE 
BEST WAY FORWARD IS. 
DO THEY CONTINUE TO FIGHT ON 
MULTIPLE FRONTS AND URGE 
KAVANAUGH TO DO THE SAME? 
URGE HIM TO TESTIFY ON THURSDAY 
AND VIGOROUSLY DEFEND HIMSELF, 
OR DO THEY DECIDE THAT WITH TWO 
ALLEGATIONS ALREADY OUT THERE, 
AND A THIRD LOOMING, BECAUSE, 
REMEMBER, MICHAEL AVENATTI, OF 
COURSE THE LAWYER FOR PORN STAR 
STORMY DANIELS, HE SAYS HE NOW 
HAS A CREDIBLE WITNESS, READY 
TO COME FORWARD AND TELL HER 
STORY. 
WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS GOING TO 
DO ABOUT THAT INFORMATION? 
THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE 
HAS RIGHT NOW, AND WE JUST HAVE 
TO WAIT AND SEE TODAY WHETHER 
THEY DECIDE IT'S ALL TOO MUCH, 
AND THEY JUST NEED TO CUT THEIR 
LOSSES AND URGE KAVANAUGH TO 
WITHDRAW, OR DO THEY STAND BY 
HIM AND TELL HIM TO FIGHT? 
>> NANCY, SPEAKING OF MICHAEL 
AVENATTI'S CLIENT, HE SPOKE TO 
CBS NEWS, DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE 
ABOUT THE THIRD ACCUSATION OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND WHAT HE 
IS SAYING? 
>> Reporter: I SPOKE TO HIM 
LATE LAST NIGHT, AND HE SAID HE 
IS NOT SOMEONE WHO IS 
INTERESTED IN TRAFFICKING IN 
RUMORS. 
HE HAS A VERY CREDIBLE CLIENT 
AND HE  SAID SHE IS GOING TO 
COME FORWARD AND TELL HER STORY 
THIS WEEK. 
BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN 
HIS TWEETS AND AN E-MAIL HE 
SENT TO REPUBLICANS ON THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HIS 
CLIENT IS GOING TO SPEAK TO 
INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED IN HIGH 
SCHOOL, AND ACCORDING TO 
AVENATTI, IT HAS TO DO WITH A 
NUMBER OF BOYS, INCLUDING 
KAVANAUGH, WHO WOULD GET YOUNG 
WOMEN DRUNK, INTENTIONALLY, AT 
PARTIES ON THE WEEKENDS, AND 
THEN ATTEMPT TO SEXUALLY 
ASSAULT THEM. 
THAT'S BASED ON WHAT HE HAS 
SAID PUBLICALLY IN TWEETS AND E-
MAILS TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
REPUBLICANS ARE SCEPTICAL. 
THEY KNOW AVENATTI HAS BEEN 
REPRESENTING ONE OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S BIGGEST FOES, AND 
SO, THEY SAY, LET'S JUST WAIT 
AND SEE WHAT HE ACTUALLY HAS 
BEFORE WE MAKE SOME DECISIONS, 
BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF 
INTRIGUE ON CAPITOL HILL ABOUT 
WHO EXACTLY THE ACCUSER IS AND 
WHEN WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM 
THEM. 
AVENATTI HAS NOT SAID 
DEFINITIVELY WHEN, WHAT DAY, 
THE ACCUSER IS GOING TO GO 
PUBLIC AND TELL HER STORY. 
>> NANCY, SOMETHING ELSE, I 
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS BURIED IN 
THE STORY, BUT IT'S INTRIGUING. 
IN THE NEW YORKER ARTICLE BY 
FARROW AND MAYER, THEY SUGGEST 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND SENATE 
REPUBLICANS WERE WORRIED ABOUT 
RONAN FARROW'S STORY DROPPING 
AND THEY KNEW OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE THE STORY 
WAS POSTED LAST NIGHT, AND WHAT 
ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THAT? 
>> Reporter: WELL, REPUBLICANS 
ARE DENYING THAT THEY KNEW 
ANYTHING ABOUT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS, BUT THAT IS TRULY 
HARD TO BELIEVE, VLAD, BECAUSE, 
WE WERE HEARING ALL KINDS OF 
RUMORS OVER THE PAST WEEK, AND 
YOU KNOW THAT IF REPORTERS WERE 
HEARING THE RUMORS, IF 
DEMOCRATS ON THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE WERE HEARING THE 
RUMORS, THE NOTION THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS WERE COMPLETELY IN 
THE DARK AND DIDN'T HEAR 
ANYTHING, IT JUST ISN'T THAT 
BELIEVABLE, FRANKLY, AND I MEAN 
IT'S ALL ANYBODY ON THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS BEEN 
THINKING ABOUT, AND THE IDEA 
THAT THEY WEREN'T HEARING THE 
RUMORS IS JUST HARD TO SWALLOW, 
AND WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING, 
REPUBLICANS ABSOLUTELY HEARD 
THE RUMORS, AND THAT'S WHY 
SUDDENLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
WEEK, YOU HAD A RENEWED PUSH 
FROM A COUPLE OF PEOPLE ON THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE LIKE 
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYING WE HAVE 
TO VOTE RIGHT AWAY. 
WE HAVE TO HOLD THE 
CONFIRMATION VOTE, WE SHOULD 
PUSH FORWARD. 
DEMOCRATS SAY IT'S BECAUSE THE 
REPUBLICANS KNEW THAT THE 
ALLEGATIONS WERE COMING, AND 
REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO ARGUE, 
AT LEAST PUBLICALLY, THEY HAD 
NO IDEA. 
>> ALL RIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO SEE WHERE IT ALL SHAKES 
OUT. 
I'M GUESSING THAT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT 
MICHAEL AVENATTI HAS TO SAY AND 
WHO THE POTENTIAL OTHER PERSON 
IS THAT ALLEGES SOME OF THE 
THINGS HE'S ALLEGING IN TWEETS. 
NANCY CORDES, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 
>>> THE DALLAS POLICE OFFICER 
WHO SHOT AND KILLED A BLACK 
NEIGHBOR HAS BEEN FIRED. 
ACCORDING TO A NEWS RELEASE, 
AMBER GUYGER WAS FIRED. 
>> GUYGER WAS ARRESTED ON 
MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES, AND SHE 
TOLD INVESTIGATORS SHE CONFUSED 
HER NEIGHBOR'S APARTMENT FOR 
HER OWN, AND SHE FIRED TWO 
SHOTS WHEN SHE DISCOVERED HIM. 
>>> MAJOR FLOODING IS IMPACTING 
NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE NEWS 
OUT OF WASHINGTON. 
THE MAN OVERSEEING THE DEPUTY 
PROBE, ROD ROSENSTEIN WILL MEET 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 
THURSDAY. 
A MEETING SET OFF RAMPANT 
SPECULATION ABOUT HIS FATE. 
THE REASON? 
FRIDAY'S BOMBSHELL REPORT THAT 
HE TALKED ABOUT SECRETLY 
RECORDING THE PRESIDENT, AND 
INVOKING THE 25th AMENDMENT TO 
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT. 
ROSENSTEIN CALLED THE STORY 
INACCURATE, AND FACTUALLY 
INCORRECT. 
HE ALSO SAID ON HIS PERSONAL 
DEALINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, 
THERE IS QUOTE NO BASIS TO 
INVOKE THE 25th AMENDMENT. 
WE SHOULD NOTE THE PRESIDENT IS 
NOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HE IS IN NEW YORK CITY. 
BUT IN A RADIO INTERVIEW THAT 
AIRED THIS MORNING, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHETHER OR 
NOT HE WOULD FIRE ROSENSTEIN. 
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S A VERY 
SAD STORY, AND PEOPLE ARE 
OBVIOUSLY, WE ARE LOOKING INTO 
IT, BUT IT'S A VERY SAD STATE 
OF AFFAIRS WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 
I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON IT 
UNTIL I GET ALL OF THE FACTS, I 
HAVEN'T GOTTEN ALL OF THE 
FACTS, BUT CERTAINLY IT'S BEING 
LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF WHAT TOOK 
PLACE, IF ANYTHING TOOK PLACE, 
AND I'LL MAKE A DETERMINATION 
SOMETIME LATER, BUT I DON'T 
HAVE THE FACTS. 
>> KEN THOMAS IS IN WASHINGTON. 
HE'S A WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS, CAITLYN HUEY 
BURNS IS A CBSN POLITICAL 
REPORTER, AND PAULA REID IS 
ALSO HERE WITH US. 
THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR BEING 
WITH US. 
THAT'S A LOT TO DISCUSS. 
PAULA, LET'S START WITH YOU. 
WE DO KNOW THAT ROSENSTEIN WAS 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HAD A 
MEETING ALREADY, AND MOVED ONTO 
ANOTHER MEETING. 
WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS TELL NEW. 
>> IT'S BEEN QUITE A MORNING. 
HE MET WITH CHIEF OF STAFF 
GENERAL KELLY, AND WE'RE TOLD 
HE WENT INTO THIS MEETING 
EXPECTING TO BE FIRED, BUT HE 
WAS NOT FIRED. 
HE THEN LEFT THAT MEETING TO GO 
TO A CABINET OFFICIAL MEETING. 
SOMETHING PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED, 
AND HE WAS ATTENDING THAT ON 
BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF 
SESSIONS. 
ONE THING I NEED TO POINT OUT 
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING 
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RIGHT 
NOW, WHICH IS KAVANAUGH. 
RIGHT NOW I'M ASKING MY 
SOURCES, WHETHER OR NOT ALL OF 
THIS, SUGGESTIONS ROSENSTEIN 
WAS GOING TO BE FIRED, WHETHER 
OR NOT THIS WAS PERHAPS AN 
INTENSAL DISTRACTION, BECAUSE 
HE WAS ALREADY SCHEDULED TO BE 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
I THINK WE JUST NEED TO 
APPROACH ALL OF THIS WITH A 
LITTLE BIT OF SKEPTICISM. 
>> HE MAY NOT GET FIRED, AND HE 
MAY NOT RESIGN? 
>> HE'S STILL THE DEPUTY 
GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL BE 
UNTIL THURSDAY. 
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME, HE WAS 
ALREADY EXPECTED TO BE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE FOR A CABINET LEVEL 
MEETING, BUT ALL OF THESE 
REPORTS HAVE HELPED TO MOVE THE 
KAVANAUGH STORY TO THE SIDE OF 
IT. 
>> LOOK AT US, HERE WE ARE, 
TALKING ABOUT ROD ROSENSTEIN. 
KEN, WOULD IT MATTER WHETHER 
ROSENSTEIN IS FIRED, OR HE 
RESIGNS? 
ULTIMATELY, DOES THAT MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE? 
>> IT DOES IN BOTH THE SHORT 
TERM AND THE LONG TERM. 
IF HE WAS FIRED, IT WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO 
NAME A REPLACEMENT OF HIS 
CHOICE, OF HIS LIKING UNDER THE 
VACANCIES ACT. 
HE WOULD HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER 
THE LINE OF SUCCESSION, IF 
ROSENSTEIN OFFERED TO RESIGN, 
THE PRESIDENT WOULD TEND TO 
HAVE MORE OF A LEEWAY TO DO 
THAT, THAT WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO 
NOEL FRANCISCO, THE SOLICITOR 
GENERAL TAKING OVER THE ROLE. 
IN THE LONG TERM, THERE'S ALSO 
THIS ISSUE OF, IF ROSENSTEIN 
WAS FIRED, THAT MIGHT RAISE 
CONCERNS AMONG THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL'S OFFICE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT COULD BE COMMITTING 
SOME SORT OF OBSTRUCTION HERE. 
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN WE 
FINALLY FIGURE THIS OUT, WHAT 
THE DISTINCTION WILL BE. 
>> WE JUST HEARD THAT NOEL 
FRANCISCO WOULD TAKE OVER, 
POTENTIALLY, IF ROSENSTEIN 
STEPS DOWN. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM? 
>> I THINK PAULA KNOWS HIM VERY 
WELL. 
>> YOU DO. 
>> SURE, YEAH, HE'S BEEN 
SOMEONE I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN THE 
HALLS. 
I'M ALWAYS ASKING HIM EVERY 
TIME I SEE HIM SMOKING A CIGAR. 
WOULD YOU TAKE OVER FOR 
MUELLER? 
HE ALWAYS IGNORES ME. 
HE'S THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, AND 
HANDLES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN 
FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT. 
IT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR THE 
SOLICITOR GENERAL TO BE IN THE 
LINE OF SUCCESSION. 
USUALLY YOU HAVE A NUMBER 1, A 
NUMBER 2, AND A NUMBER 3. 
WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL AT THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOW YOU 
HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO 
HAS RECUSED HIMSELF. 
THE NUMBER THREE, RACHEL BRAND 
WENT ON TO WORK FOR WAL-MART. 
THAT'S HOW HE WOULD POSSIBLY 
INHERIT THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION. 
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR, EVEN BASED ON 
MY REPORTING OF HIM, WHETHER OR 
NOT HE WOULD BE DEFERENTIAL TO 
THE PRESIDENT IN THOSE KEY 
DECISIONS. 
IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE 
MUELLER PROBE, NOT ONLY ARE YOU 
THE FINAL RUBBER STAMP, YOU ARE 
ALSO THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO 
MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. 
WHAT TO DO WITH THE BIG REPORT 
THAT MUELLER ISSUES AT THE END. 
WHICH ISN'T COMING ANYTIME 
SOON, LET ME TELL YOU. 
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE IF 
THERE IS ANY CRIMINAL EVIDENCE 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. 
DO YOU HAND IT OFF TO CONGRESS, 
DO YOU STICK IT  A DRAWER? 
THERE IS NO RULE FOR THAT. 
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHO 
IS IN THAT POSITION. 
>> IS THERE ANY INDICATION ON 
HOW NOEL FRANCISCO THINKS ABOUT 
THIS? 
>> NO, HE KEEPS IGNORING ME. 
JUST SMOKES HIS CIGARS. 
>> TO PAULA'S EARLIER POINT, 
THAT PERHAPS THIS IS A 
DISTRACTION COMING OUT OF THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
>> IT'S REALLY INTERESTING. 
IF IN FACT, ROSENSTEIN AT THE 
PRESIDENT MEET ON THURSDAY, AS 
SARAH SANDERS SAID THAT THEY 
WOULD DO, THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO 
BE THE DAY THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED 
TO HAVE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
HEARING AT WHICH KAVANAUGH IS 
EXPECTED TO TESTIFY, AND 
NEGOTIATIONS ARE STILL UNDERWAY 
BETWEEN CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, 
WHO HAS ACCUSED KAVANAUGH OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND WHILE THEY 
WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, WHETHER 
SHE WILL IN FACT APPEAR AT THAT 
AS WELL. 
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR 
A DELAY IN LIGHT OF NEW 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE SURFACED 
IN REPORTING FROM THE NEW 
YORKER. 
THAT'S WHERE YOU COULD HAVE 
THESE TWO STORYLINES COMING TO 
A HEAD, NONE OF WHICH WOULD BE 
GOOD FOR THE PRESIDENT 
POLITICALLY. 
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO 
CONSIDER, TOO, IS THE IDEA THAT 
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS HAD OPPOSED 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION TO BEGIN 
WITH, BECAUSE OF STATEMENTS 
THAT HE HAD MADE PREVIOUSLY 
ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT 
COULD BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED 
AS IT RELATES TO AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
SO DEMOCRATS HAD RAISED A LOT 
OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW KAVANAUGH 
WOULD RESPOND TO THAT. 
SO THERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE 
DIFFERENT KIND OF STORYLINES 
AND THREADS COMING TO A HEAD. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
I WANT TO TURN TO YOU NOW. 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SENIOR 
TRUMP OFFICIALS TO REACT. 
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT IT ON 
SUNDAY. 
>> IF YOU CAN'T BE ON THE TEAM, 
IF YOU'RE NOT SUPPORTING THIS 
MISSION, THEN MAYBE YOU JUST 
OUGHT TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO 
DO. 
I'VE TOLD THAT TO MY SENIOR 
COLLEAGUES, JUNIOR FOLKS. 
WE NEED EVERYONE TO ACHIEVE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MISSION. 
I HOPE EVERYONE IS ON THAT 
MISSION. 
IF YOU'RE NOT, YOU SHOULD TAKE 
THIS TIME TO GO DO SOMETHING 
MORE PRODUCTIVE. 
>> GOT TO BE ON THE TEAM. 
SO KEN, AS WE KNOW, ATTORNEY 
GENERAL JEFF SESSION'S FATE HAS 
BEEN HANGING IN THE BALANCE FOR 
QUITE SOME TIME NOW. 
WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE HIM? 
WOULD THIS MAKE IT HARDER, OR 
EASIER FOR THE PRESIDENT TO GET 
RID OF HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS INDICATED 
PREVIOUSLY THAT HE WOULDN'T 
MAKE ANY DECISION ON JEFF 
SESSIONS' FATE UNTIL AFTER THE 
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, THIS IS 
NOT HAPPENING IN A VACUUM. 
JEFF SESSIONS STILL REMAINS 
VERY WELL REGARDED IN THE 
SENATE. 
HE'S A FORMER ALABAMA SENATOR, 
AND RIGHT NOW, THE WHITE HOUSE 
NEEDS VOTES FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
TO GET HIM ACROSS THE FINISH 
LNE. 
SO IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD DO SOMETHING 
LIKE FIRE JEFF SESSIONS ON THE 
CUSP OF THIS VOTER FOR 
KAVANAUGH. 
BUT IF ROSENSTEIN LEAVES, YOU 
HAVE TO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 
IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, 
SESSIONS' TIME THERE AT THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT COULD BE 
NUMBERED. 
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN 
MIND THAT THE REASON ROD 
ROSENSTEIN HAS BEEN OVERSEEING 
THIS INVESTIGATION IS BECAUSE 
JEFF SESSIONS WAS THE ONE WHO 
RECUSED HIMSELF. 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO HARP ON 
TO THIS DAY. 
HE FELT THAT SESSIONS BETRAYED 
HIM BY MAKING THAT DECISION TO 
RECUSE HIMSELF, AND IN IS SO, 
IT'S HARD TO SEE SESSIONS EVER 
YOU KNOW, FINDING HIMSELF BACK 
IN THE PRESIDENT'S GOOD GRACES, 
BUT I DON'T EXPECT THAT IT 
WOULD HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. 
I THINK THEY NEED THE VOTES IN 
THE SENATE, YOU KNOW, IT'S MUCH 
TOO IMPORTANT FOR THAT AS IT 
RELATES TO KAVANAUGH. 
>> TRENDING IN DANGEROUS WATERS 
HERE, THOUGH. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS NEXT 
QUESTION. 
WE KNOW THAT DEMOCRATIC 
LAWMAKERS FOR MONTHS HAVE BEEN 
CALLING TO TAKE ACTION FOR THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
HOW DOES ALL OF THIS AFFECT 
WHAT THEY WANT? 
>> THAT HAS BEEN IN THEIR 
INTEREST FOR THE PAST SEVERAL 
MONTHS, BUT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
POINTED TO BY REPUBLICANS AS A 
COMPLETE HYPOTHETICAL. 
EVERY TIME YOU WOULD ASK 
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE 
NEED TO PROTECT THE SPECIAL 
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, YOU DID 
HAVE A FEW LAWMAKERS WHO WANTED 
TO PUT FORTH LEGISLATION, TOM 
TILLIS AND OTHERS AMONG THEM. 
BUT YOU WOULD HEAR THAT THE 
PRESIDENT ISN'T GOING TO DO 
THAT. 
THERE IS NO NEED TO PUT THIS IN 
LEGISLATIVE FORM, BECAUSE THEY 
DIDN'T EXPECT HE WOULD DO THAT. 
THE QUESTION I HAVE AS OF 
TODAY, EVEN THOUGH ROD 
ROSENSTEIN DOES REMAIN THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED 
STATES, DOES THIS PROMPT 
LAWMAKERS TO REVISIT THIS 
LEDGIZATION, AND SAY THIS IS NO 
LONGER QUITE A HYPOTHETICAL. 
WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A 
FIRE DRILL THIS WEEK, IF WE CAN 
CALL IT THAT. 
SO DO WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING 
IN PLACE, TO PLACE SOME 
PARAMETERS AROUND THE MUELLER 
PROBE? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
CAITLYN HUEY BURNS. 
PAULA REID, KEN THOMAS. 
THANKS TO ALL OF YOU. 
WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS MUCH 
LONGER, BUT WE'VE GOT TO MOVE 
ONTO SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WHO IS PUSHING 
BACK AGAINST ALLEGATIONS OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 
ON SUNDAY, THE NEW YORKER 
REPORTED ANOTHER ACCUSER, 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ, CLAIMED 
KAVANAUGH PULLED DOWN HIS PANTS 
AND EXPOSED HIMSELF TO HER 
WHILE THE TWO WERE FRESHMAN AT 
YALE. 
SHE IS CALLING ON THE FBI TO 
INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT. 
THIS COMES AS KAVANAUGH'S FIRST 
ACCUSER HAS AGREED TO TESTIFY 
BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
KAVANAUGH ALSO DENIES THOSE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT 
SAYS HE STANDS BY HIS NOMINEE. 
>> HE'S A FINE MAN. 
WITH AN UNBLEMISHED PAST. 
AND THESE ARE HIGHLY 
UNSUBSTANTIATED STATEMENTS FROM 
PEOPLE REPRESENTED BY LAWYERS. 
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE 
LAWYERS DOING THE 
REPRESENTATION. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S AN 
OUTSTANDING PERSON, AND I AM 
WITH HIM ALL THE WAY. 
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES WITH THE 
SENATE. 
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES WITH THE 
VOTE. 
>> CBS NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT, NANCY CORTEZ 
JOINS US NOW FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
HOW ARE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS 
RESPONDING TO THESE NEW 
ALLEGATIONS LAID OUT IN THE NEW 
YORKER ABOUT KAVANAUGH? 
>> WELL, THEY'VE BEEN QUITE 
QUIET ACTUALLY. 
WE DID JUST SEE A TWEET A SHORT 
TIME AGO FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM 
WHO SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE 
SHOULD GO AHEAD WITH THIS 
HEARING WITH CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD ON THURSDAY, AND VOTE 
SHORTLY THEREAFTER. 
BEYOND THAT, WE'RE NOT HEARING 
A TON FROM REPUBLICANS RIGHT 
NOW. 
IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY'RE STILL 
DIGESTING THIS NEW INFORMATION 
ABOUT A SECOND ACCUSER. 
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO MEET 
WITH ONE ANOTHER, AND FIGURE 
OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING 
TO DO GOING FORWARD. 
DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER HAND, 
HAVE BEEN QUITE VOCAL, YOU HAVE 
A NUMBER OF THEM CALLING ON 
KAVANAUGH TO WITHDRAW HIS 
NOMINATION. 
YOU'VE GOT A NUMBER OF THEM, 
INCLUDING DIANNE FEINSTEIN 
SAYING THAT THIS HEARING WITH 
BLASEY FORD SHOULD BE CANCELED, 
ALL TOGETHER, NOW THAT IT'S 
BEEN SCHEDULED, BECAUSE THEY 
THINK THAT THE FACT THAT A 
SECOND ACCUSER HAS COME 
FORWARD, JUST SHOWS WHY THE FBI 
NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE. 
OF COURSE, EVERYONE IS SORT OF 
ON TENDER HOOKS WAITING TO SEE 
WHAT THE LAWYER MICHAEL 
AVENATTI HAS. 
HE SAYS HE REPRESENTS A NEW 
CLIENT WHO ALSO HAS 
INFORMATION. 
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE 
INFORMATION ON THAT? 
SORT OF EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW 
THIS MYSTERY THIRD WOMAN. 
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING? 
>> YES, WE DO HAVE SOME 
INFORMATION, AND I'VE BEEN ON 
THE PHONE RECENTLY WITH 
AVENATTI, WHO IS ACTUALLY 
APPEARING IN COURT IN 
CALIFORNIA LATER TODAY IN THE 
STORMY DANIELS CASE. 
SO HE'S KIND OF WORKING BOTH 
ENDS OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. 
BUT HE SAYS THAT THIS IS A 
WOMAN WHO WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF 
KAVANAUGH'S. 
SHE WENT TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL 
NEAR GEORGETOWN PREP WHERE 
KAVANAUGH WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL 
AND WA
