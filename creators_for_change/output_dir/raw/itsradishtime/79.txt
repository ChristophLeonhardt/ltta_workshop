god that whenever i see cotton candy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,990

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,690
power to go to a zoo or a fairground or

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,330
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> baseball game without acquiring blue</font>

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,060
sugar sugar so much better when it's

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,460
blue I get it it's kind of childish so I

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,160
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compensate in other ways like</font>

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,640
when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> my first job 22</font>

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,410
baby-faced and really desperate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,349
taken seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of maybe gotten</font>

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,300
my job at a non-profit because my dad

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,850
was a volunteer there or at least helped

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,010
but I just gotten promoted to a

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,110
full-time position that I felt like I to

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,239
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> earned I was a real</font>

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional adult and I wanted to look</font>

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,340
the part so it was all pencil skirts and

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,230
metrics and accountability and deleting

20
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,850
all the exclamation points out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,340
emails and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> working I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was starting</font>

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get that r-e-s-p-e-c-t and none of my</font>

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,660
co-workers were making those casual

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,129
shitty jokes where the punch line is

25
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">always like Millennials emojis what's a</font>

26
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,430
snapchat but then one day our<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,350
donor decided to treat our staff and

28
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,900
took us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> his private box to see a</font>

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,939
baseball game I was enjoying the game

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,560
with my<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-workers being kind of</font>

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,970
impressive because I'm a woman who knows

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rules of baseball and kind of</font>

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,869
impressive because the fancy CEO guy who

34
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,060
invited<font color="#E5E5E5"> us sent his son to the same high</font>

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,950
school as me and he remembered my name

36
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,590
it was all leveraging strategies and

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,770
runs<font color="#E5E5E5"> batted in and then the cotton candy</font>

38
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,860
came by and I got a bag because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the Lord calls me to do at first it</font>

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
was fine I figured game recognize game

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,280
nobody in here thinks that my stupid

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,560
snack is any more juvenile and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,960
pretzel bites and hot dogs but maybe 15

minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> later at my phone screen blinks</font>

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,040
caption having fun and that's when I

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,049
bag of cotton candy without my awareness

50
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,009
and texted it to my dad how am I

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,060
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a professional when</font>

build up<font color="#E5E5E5"> my corporate credit and it was</font>

56
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,400
destroyed in one fatal delicious mistake

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,800
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is until I realized that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,110
still eat cotton candy and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>
