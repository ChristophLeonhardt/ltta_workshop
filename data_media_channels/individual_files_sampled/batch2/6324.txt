new evidence indicates how and why Harvey Weinstein worked with certain tabloid media outlets in order to smear women and journalists who would come out against him with sexual assault allegations now this is something that Ronan Farrow has really brought light to and he's done really excellent reporting here but I wanted to share the story with you an outline exactly who Harvey Weinstein worked with and how he managed to create these campaigns to smear women and journalists who might come out against him now Weinstein had hired private security agencies including one called black cube run by former Israeli intelligence officers and another called PS ops in Los Angeles to keep tabs on actresses and journalists he also enlisted journalists in his campaign to investigate and discredit not just accusers but other journalists specifically other journalists who would have the audacity to do reporting on you know his predatory behavior so I want to say two key things here before we tell you the rest of the story one is that you know that a you might be doing something shady if you're going with a company called black cube like these guys have a way of just like saying what they are like Blackwater you're my mother they're like who names themselves Blackwater 8 and so these guys are black cube don't worry we're gonna do something shady the other guys are PS ops like psy ops yeah like here we're over here if you wanna do shady crimp well I don't wanna say criminal you don't know there might be perfectly legal and they're probably careful about that stuff but if you'd like to do shady stuff we named ourselves it's like name yourself shady incorporated yeah okay anyway now by the way you got to know that Weinstein is not the only person doing this first of all Trump has used these same national Enquirer's you're about to see because National Enquirer is part of this story but Trump has also used them to smear opponents including Republican opponents remember when the National Enquirer ran the story about how Ted Cruz had five mistresses like five women would sleep with Ted Cruz it's more chance that the National Enquirer story about aliens landing is called yeah okay so anyway yeah and and a lot of Hollywood does this when journalists go to report on any kind of sex scandal or anything else they will send these guys out to threaten other journalists yeah so but now we get to find out because the Weinstein scandal how it works exactly so let me give you some context before I get to a specific email exchanges that Weinstein is included in so one of the efforts was to smear Rose McGowan and apparently it was discovered that Rose McGowan had some sort of relationship with a director named Robert Rodriguez okay Robert Rodriguez was married at the time to a woman named Elizabeth Avalon and Weinstein knew that and he realized that they had divorced and decided to hire opposition researchers and certain reporters to kind of dig into that issue and figure out if they can get some you know bad information or information that showed Rose McGowan a negative light and they did manage to do that so there was a reporter named Andy who reached out to Elizabeth Avalon again who was married to Robert Rodriguez they're now divorced and there was a rumor that he had some sort of affair or sexual relationship with Rose McGowan now one of Weinstein's foot soldiers was Dylan Howard the chief content officer of American media Inc which publishes tabloids including the National Enquirer where Howard also serves as editor-in-chief so all of a sudden this reporter named Andy who is associated with all of this goes to talk to Avalon and starts you know pushing for answers regarding Rose McGowan's character that information is then relayed back to Howard and Howard tells Weinstein I got some dirt in one of the email exchanges Howard says the following I have some amazed I have something amazing Howard gushed in an email to Weinstein my guy spoke with Elizabeth Avalon she is a good talker he went on to describe unflattering things Avalon had said about McGowan during her coverage station with this reporter Andy right now we have screenshots of these exchanges between Weinstein and Howard here's an example of it Weinstein responded to that email by saying this is the killer especially if my fingerprints are not on this and Dylan Howard responded they are not and the conversation between you and I is recorded I don't know I don't know how that's a good thing but yeah I think that he's saying like we have mutual dirt on each other so we're cool okay that's my interpretation of it but don't worry your fingerprints won't be on this as we just now talked about it on that apparently your fingerprints were on an RV and it's the thing you get into bed with guys who are doing shady stuff at some point they're gonna turn to shady stuff against you yeah and so I don't know they never explained who Andy is Andy's a guy that they you know contract out to who poses as a reporter and he gets you to confide in him yeah and she keeps asking like Avalon poor woman she's like I don't want to say bad things about my husband I want this to be off the record I don't want to talk about this but to her credit she didn't want to say negative things about anyone including McGowan even though you know it was clear in some of her statements that she's not a fan of McGowan because of this you know alleged relationship that Robert Rodriguez her ex-husband had with with her but nonetheless she's like look I have a great relationship with my ex-husband I have five kids with him I care about my children I don't want to say any negative things but this so-called reporter Andy was so persistent he was relentless that he got a little bit of a negative comment from Avalon and that was the so-called like oh this is the killer you know so he apparently works on behalf of Andy Andy does on behalf of Coleman Rayner and that's the LOS angeles-based news and photo agency that works on stories for various tabloids so but remember this story was not necessarily going to go to print they just wanted information that they could use to maybe even threaten her and say hey we we know that this stuff about you so these guys pose as journalists when they're actually in an unofficial way looking to blackmail people yeah now legally that might not be blackmail but they're trying to get dirt on them so that a powerful person who has done terrible things to them can cover up their crimes and in case of Harvey Weinstein it was crimes and so this is how they you you know you know a lot of ways ruin journalism and then they use it to threaten other journals that are actually doing their jobs right absolutely and by the way so again going back to the question that you hear over and over again from people who are suspicious of any and all allegations that are made this is the reason why women don't speak up right this is one of the reasons why women don't speak sure there's just so much you know retaliation that can be taken against them if they are you know accusing someone who is in a position of power you're talking about Harvey Weinstein yes every resource at his disposal and and now we have evidence of how he would smear people and and threaten them so they wouldn't speak up including journalists so some people say oh that's a conspiracy theory no no that's what they would say in the past like oh why would anybody want to smear a victim because their ass is on the line and they have a lot of money in power so they get a higher black cube and I'm a bad person Incorporated yeah they go and then yes it is an actual conspiracy they work together to make sure they smear any woman that comes out that's why they don't come out because they yeah because someone will go to destroy their careers in their lives if they do now you know the reality and so all of these guys whatever their political proclivity is whether it's Weinstein or Trump there's such bad guys who go go do this too just not only did they do the scummy things in the first place then they go to destroy their victims right to protect themselves so they can continue victimizing other people who are not in positions of power it's disgusting and now you know how power works yeah if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea network.com slash join get the whole younger so every day
