Welcome to Pandora. This planet featured
in the James Cameron film “Avatar”,
has been brought to life in a new section 
at Disney's Animal Kingdom
Across this beautiful bridge, which is 
all sort of hand-built
out of all this exotic 
Navi tribal material.
And as we make this transition, the 
habitat changes again.
There are different kinds of plants
growing down here.
It takes that film's world of floating 
mountains and lush vegetation
and brings it to tactile life
for park visitors.
It's made up of many parts, but its 
sum leaves an overwhelming impression.
We’re here up in the canyon below the
waterfalls looking out at
the floating mountains, 
which are over this way
suspended overhead, over the entire land.
The attention to detail is noticeable with
hand-carved rocks
and various species of plants invented 
for the world.
There's also a drum circle with 
instruments visitors can play.
It becomes really really spectacular 
at night because all around us are
bioluminescent plants that illuminate, 
and not only do they illuminate,
but they're integrated to each other 
so that pulses and waves of light
can go through the entire land.
We hope that people take away from 
our world of Pandora
the same underlying message they 
can take away from the film “Avatar”.
Which is our obligation to act 
with care and respect
for the world of nature all around us.
