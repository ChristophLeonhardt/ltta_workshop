1
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:11,071
>> Tucker: WE TOLD YOU

2
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,973
REPEATEDLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE

3
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:14,474
OF WEEKS THAT THE FAA, WHICH IS

4
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,277
IN CHARGE OF YOUR SAFETY WHEN

5
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:20,147
YOU TRAVEL BY AIR AS ALTERED ITS

6
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:22,115
MERIT BASED HIRING TESTING FOR

7
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,217
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS, ADDING

8
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:26,720
IN A BOGUS BIOGRAPHICAL

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,487
QUESTIONNAIRE TO THE PROCESS.

10
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:30,123
THE NEW TEST IS NOT ENOUGH, THEY

11
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:31,525
ARE SEEKING OUT THE UNQUALIFIED

12
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:32,325
INTENTIONALLY.

13
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:33,527
BUT EVEN MORE WORRISOME THAN

14
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:36,329
THAT IS THE FACT THAT THE FAA

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:37,531
APPARENTLY DIDN'T CARE IF PEOPLE

16
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,533
CHEATED ON THEIR ALREADY

17
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,568
WATERED-DOWN TEST.

18
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:44,604
IN 2016, THE DEPARTMENT OF

19
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:46,673
TRANSPORTATION FOUND THAT THE

20
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:49,276
NATIONAL COALITION OF EMPLOYEES

21
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:50,210
HAD GIVEN THEIR MEMBERS GUIDANCE

22
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,111
ON HOW TO ANSWER THE

23
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,279
QUESTIONNAIRE.

24
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,079
IN OTHER WORDS THE GROUP HELP

25
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,683
THEM CHEAT BY GIVING THEM THE

26
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,518
CORRECT ANSWERS AHEAD OF TIME.

27
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,086
DESPITE THAT NO ONE WAS EVER

28
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,955
CHARGED, AND IN FACT ONE UNION

29
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:03,123
MEMBER CONNECTED TO THE CHEATING

30
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:06,126
APPEARS TO BE STILL EMPLOYED BY

31
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:06,459
THE FAA.

32
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,094
MICHAEL PEARSON IS A FORMER AIR

33
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,130
TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, HE'S AN

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,165
ATTORNEY, AND HE'S INVOLVED IN

35
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:14,334
LITIGATION SURROUNDING THE FAA

36
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:15,135
HIRING PRACTICES.

37
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:17,103
HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

38
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,805
MICHAEL PEARSON, THANKS FOR

39
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:19,706
COMING ON.

40
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:20,740
THIS IS SUCH A STRONG

41
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,143
ALLEGATION, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT

42
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:25,679
IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

43
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,480
>> Michael: I HAVE BEEN

44
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,648
INVOLVED IN THIS SENSE IT

45
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:29,783
ACTUALLY BEGAN COMPASS AS I

46
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:30,283
HEARD ABOUT IT.

47
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,484
WITH THE MERGING OF THE FOLKS

48
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:33,119
THAT WERE WATCHING YOUR SHOW,

49
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,020
YOU REMEMBER YOU HAD THOUSANDS

50
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,523
OF PEOPLE ON THE LIST THAT WERE

51
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:37,557
QUALIFIED INCLUDING WITH

52
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:40,694
MILITARY EXPERIENCE AND AVIATION

53
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:41,528
EXPERIENCE.

54
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:43,196
IT ALL OF A SUDDEN WAS PURGED,

55
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:44,865
AND THE FAA'S WORDS AND THEY

56
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:48,535
WERE FORCED TO GO THROUGH THIS

57
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,836
BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONNAIRE.

58
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:53,974
SO FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS,

59
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:55,475
INCLUDING LITIGATION OF MY FIRM,

60
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:59,279
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DIG UP

61
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,013
INFORMATION THROUGH THE FREEDOM

62
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,481
OF INFORMATION ACT PROCESS AS

63
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,683
WELL AS THE LITIGATION PROCESS.

64
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:08,354
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE INTERNAL

65
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:10,857
PEOPLE TELL US THIS WAS GOING

66
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:11,691
ON, BUT THEY WERE AFRAID IF THEY

67
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:15,562
CAME FORWARD THE FAA WOULD

68
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,497
PENALIZE THEM.

69
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:20,567
NOW WE HAVE ACTUAL DOCUMENTARY

70
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,968
EVIDENCE THAT SUBSTANTIATES OUR

71
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:22,369
WORST FEARS.

72
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:24,504
>> Tucker: SO THE UNION HELPED

73
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:26,106
PEOPLE CHEAT ON THE TEST.

74
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,108
AGAIN, JUST TO PUT THIS IN

75
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:28,875
CONTEXT, TO BECOME AIR TRAFFIC

76
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:32,312
CONTROLLERS AND CONTROL

77
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:33,480
AVIATION, MILLIONS USE IT EVERY

78
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,780
YEAR.

79
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,349
AND YET NO ONE WAS EVER CHARGED

80
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,752
FOR THAT, WHY?

81
00:02:38,752 --> 00:02:41,221
>> Michael: IT WASN'T A UNION,

82
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,490
IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE GROUP.

83
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,891
THE NATIONAL BLACK COALITION OF

84
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,893
FEDERAL AVIATION EMPLOYEES, THAT

85
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,930
CERTAINLY DID THAT.

86
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,100
IT WAS A PROCESS STARTED FROM

87
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,703
EARLY 2012 THROUGH 2013.

88
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:58,905
THERE WAS A GROUP WITHIN THAT

89
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,073
ORGANIZATION WHO DETERMINED THAT

90
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,708
THE MAKEUP OF THE WORKFORCE WAS

91
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,078
TOO WHITE AND THEY WANTED TO GET

92
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:06,780
A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE.

93
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,915
THEY LOBBIED THROUGH THE

94
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,550
POLITICAL FORCE, WHICH THEY ARE

95
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,689
ALLOWED TO COME UP BUT THEN THEY

96
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,490
THEN CRAFTED THIS EXAM.

97
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,861
THE SCORING GROUP ACTUALLY

98
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:22,595
PENALIZE PEOPLE WITH AVIATION

99
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,698
EXPERIENCE.

100
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:28,234
AND TO MAKE IT WORSE, THEY HAD

101
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,904
FOLKS STAND IN LINE FOR THIS

102
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:32,272
TEST AND THEY COACHED OTHER

103
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:34,107
PEOPLE HOW TO PASS THE TEST.

104
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,743
NOT ONLY WERE THE BEST AND

105
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:37,377
BRIGHTEST ACTUALLY BRIDGED

106
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,546
STOMACH PURGED OFF OF THE LIST,

107
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,548
THEY WERE THEN FORCED THROUGH A

108
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:42,115
SCREENING PROCESS THAT

109
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:45,485
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THEM.

110
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:48,288
SO MOST IF NOT THE GREAT

111
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:49,289
MAJORITY OF THEM FAILED THAT

112
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,090
EXAM.

113
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,725
PEOPLE WERE GIVEN THE ANSWERS ON

114
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:54,327
HOW TO PASS THE TEST AND EVEN

115
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,029
MORE IMPORTANT, RECENT DOCUMENTS

116
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:58,064
SHOW THAT WHEN THIS INDIVIDUAL

117
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:00,400
WAS INTERVIEWED, HE GAVE A

118
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,701
WRITTEN STATEMENT SAYING THAT HE

119
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:02,168
DIDN'T DO THAT.

120
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:05,005
THEN HE WENT TO A VERBAL

121
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:11,044
INTERVIEW WITH THE D.O.T.

122
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:11,745
INVESTIGATOR.

123
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:14,047
THE D.O.T. OIG INVESTIGATOR

124
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,248
ALLOWED HIM TO SEE WITNESS

125
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:16,683
STATEMENTS CONTRADICTING THAT,

126
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,017
AND THEN ALLOWED HIM TO GO OUT

127
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,819
OF THE ROOM WITH HIS ATTORNEY

128
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,553
AND CHANGED HIS STORY.

129
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,723
THAT IS NOT DONE.

130
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,291
ANYONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE

131
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,762
LAW FROM A LEGAL SIDE KNOWS THAT

132
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:30,497
THAT IS BEYOND UNUSUAL.

133
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:32,499
THAT'S CRAFTING AN INVESTIGATION

134
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:37,704
TO MEET.

135
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:38,371
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON BOTH

136
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,907
SIDES OF THE AISLE THAT WERE

137
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,243
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROCESS,

138
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,111
AND THE D.O.T. OIG

139
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:49,682
INVESTIGATOR'S FINAL RESULT ARE

140
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:53,286
BASICALLY HIS SUGGESTION OR

141
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,589
RECOMMENDATION WAS, THIS NOT BE

142
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,726
FORWARDED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

143
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:01,528
JUSTICE FOR CRIMINAL

144
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:01,961
INVESTIGATION.

145
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:09,102
YOU HAVE ALL PEOPLE AND

146
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,503
IRONICALLY ENOUGH, THE

147
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,505
ARCHITECTS, AND, INTO MENTALS

148
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:13,306
DON'T LIKE IMPLEMENTERS AND

149
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:16,309
FACILITATORS ARE STILL AT HIGH

150
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:16,843
LEVELS OF THE FAA.

151
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,044
>> Tucker: I NEVER SAY THIS

152
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,913
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD

153
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:26,119
BE IN PRISON.

154
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,855
>> Michael: AT THE DO GA ALONG

155
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:29,589
WITH THE FBI SHOULD INVESTIGATE

156
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,092
WHAT WENT ON AND WHAT REALLY

157
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:33,526
OCCURRED AND THE DUE PROCESS OF

158
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,295
LAW SHOULD REALLY BE FOLLOWED.

159
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,629
THE FOLKS IN THE FAA AT THE

160
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:41,501
HIGHEST MANAGEMENT LEVELS SHOULD

161
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,902
BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

162
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:44,137
IT'S BOTH CIVILLY AND CRIMINALLY

163
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,439
ILLEGAL TO DO WHAT HAPPENED HERE

164
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:46,906
ILLEGAL TO DO WHAT HAPPENED HER

165
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,241
HERE.

166
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,243
>> Tucker: THE AIR TRAFFIC

167
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:51,911
CONTROL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY.

168
00:05:51,911 --> 00:00:00,000
IF YOU ARE BASICALLY THIRD WORLD
