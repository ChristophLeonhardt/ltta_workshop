last week you might remember that I reported on a college professor who shot himself in the arm allegedly to protest president Donald Trump now however he's changing his story saying that it was to protest malnutrition pollution and ar-15s let's check it out mark bird is a 69 year old sociology professor who taped a $100 bill to a college of southern nevada bathroom with a note reading for the janitor before proceeding to shoot himself in the arm while bird told students staff doctors and police that he shot himself to protest Trump immediately after it happened he now says he did it to protest ar-15s but here's the thing he didn't even use an ar-15 to shoot himself in an apology letter to the school's president and VP Byrd gave two reasons for shooting himself saying the earth has roughly 100 million malnutrition and pollution deaths in the past decade and the earth is on course for at least another 100 million such deaths in the next decade and complaining that since the Las Vegas Massacre last year there has been no national legislation banning bumps talks banning civilian ownership of ar-15 style assault weapons and the passage of universal gun background checks so I'm guessing that the reasoning here was to attract media attention by doing something really drastic and then giving himself a megaphone that way bird says he shot himself on campus because he knew the College of Southern Nevada police would not let him die but here's the most interesting part of the article bird only bought two rounds of ammunition he's he only needed to fire the gun once according to blue lives matter he told the officer that the guns instructions implied it had to be loaded with two bullets to fire the police report said this suggests that bird had never operated a firearm before I wonder if he's also one of those guys who thinks you just hold the trigger down on the ar-15 and gets a fire unlimited bullets anyway Birds alright as he missed his artery and didn't even need pain medication he still is however banned from campus and charged with carrying a dangerous weapon at school and without a permit as well as shooting it inside a restricted environment for campus unmasked I'm Rob Jim Shaw if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm
