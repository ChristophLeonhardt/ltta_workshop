what now for Washington's relations with the rest of the world Donald Trump fires America's top diplomat will Rex Tillerson his replacements toe the line with the president's vision for foreign policy this is incise story hello and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle it was an abrupt end by tweet after months of speculation and denial Donald Trump turned to Twitter to fire America's top diplomat Democrats say the loss of Rex Tillerson is yet another sign of chaos in the White House Trump blames policy differences and lack of personal chemistry for the departure of his Secretary of State the President's Choice to replace him as CIA director Mike Pompeo whom he says shares the same thought process we'll speak to our guests in just a moment but first here's our State Department correspondent Rosalynn Jordan it's not every day you lose your job via social media but an emotional Rex Tillerson deliberately ignored that detail when he addressed reporters on Tuesday I received a call today from the president United States at a little after noontime from Air Force One my Commission his Secretary of State will terminate at midnight March the 31st Tillerson served as US Secretary of State for a little more than a year he spent much of that time pushing back against reports that the president Donald Trump wanted to fire him on Tuesday morning on Twitter Trump did just that Mike Pompeo will become our new Secretary of State thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service Trump then told reporters this we disagree don't when you look at the Iran deal I think it's terrible I guess he fit it was okay I wanted to either break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently so we were not really thinking the same looking back it's clear Trump and Tillerson disagreed on the big problems of the day whether or not to engage directly with North Korea how far to hold Russia accountable for its meddling in US political and civic affairs something Tillerson made a point of stressing the US must do ultimately former US diplomats say tiller since firing is no surprise and neither is the choice of his replacement the CIA director Mike Pompeo he's well known for his support of Trump's policies Trump is impulsive and Trump is temperamental Trump once once enablers and validators more than he wants advisors Tillerson didn't have many fans at state because of his plans to cut staffing by nearly 30 percent some senior diplomats quit in protest but the firings at state didn't end there at lunchtime the White House dismissed Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein after he released this statement suggesting Tillerson thought his job was safe the secretary did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason for his dismissal in any case Tillerson said he had no regrets brucks Tillerson didn't lose his job because he didn't agree with the president analysts say he lost his job because he refused to pretend that he agreed if confirmed Mike Pompeo will face a very high standard of agreeing with the president all of the time especially because the President believes he already does rosalind jordan al Jazeera the State Department on the White House until ISM have had a series of public spats things were never quite the same after he was quoted as calling Trump a moron the Secretary's profound disagreements with the President on policy appear to be his undoing Trump has made no secret of his distaste for the Iran nuclear deal calling it an embarrassment to the United States dozen argued that the US should remain in step with European allies and supported the agreement Trump also publicly stated the former Texas oilman was wasting his time trying to negotiate with North Korea so there's an offer to begin direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions and he wanted to remain part of the Paris agreement on climate change Trump withdrew plus when Saudi Arabia led the blockade against Qatar nine months ago Tilton attempted to calm the crisis and mediate but Trump undercut him by publicly siding with the Saudis okay let's bring in our guests now joining us from Washington Michael O'Hanlon senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institute from Brussels James Morales a former EU representative in countries throughout the Middle East Asia and Africa and from Whistler in Canada via Skype Glen Carl a former CIA officer and deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats at the Central Intelligence Council great to have you all here Michael let's start by giving a thought shall we took Rex Tillerson was he a marked man ever since the day he refused to deny calling President Trump a moron well you're right that there were some tensions although I did not totally agree with the way that Tillerson was described in your earlier news report or the way in which he sometimes been portrayed in some of the American media reporting here in Washington I think that in fact some of the agreements were not as profound as implied for example on North Korea President Trump is coming around to doing exactly what Tillerson said he should do all along so it's it's maybe more about personal chemistry and style and then as you say some perceived slights here and there I think Tillerson took far more of the slights and absorbed far more of them than he ever dished out but president Trump's a very hard guy to work for I'm sure and Teller soon because he was Secretary of State he had to deal with so many issues so frequently that it was inevitable that he and Trump would be contradicting each other since Trump was contradicting himself quite frequently so I think it's it's unfair to Tillerson to say that he was somehow a fundamental loggerheads with Trump on a number of key issues Trump himself was sorting through a lot of different positions and he evolved a great deal in the 14 months the Tillerson was at Foggy Bottom Trump changed a lot of his own views and I think generally in a favorable direction so I would give Tillerson some credit for having moderated and stabilized some of trumps initial instincts okay so it's a little different overall depiction Ben some of the common commentary again do you agree with that do you give Tillison credit was he right for the role was he ever comfortable in his role as Secretary of State well I don't think he was right for the role and I he clearly was not comfortable in it but he was a rare presence of rationality reason and and relatively solid thinking with regard to foreign issues which is why he was at odds and was with Trump and was struggling to change Trump's views and I think that's ultimately why he was fired the personal chemistry chemistry is important for Trump clearly as it is for most people but especially Trump but he Tillerson was a voice of reason in a house of the Mad Hatter and that's ultimately why he went and now Trump has found someone who will be a sycophant and aggressive one for me well let's talk about pump air in just a second James first of all before we do I want to know whether tell us him was someone that the Europeans likes to deal with yeah Laura hi from Brussels I think yes indeed there was a relationship with European politicians although it must be said that don't think mr. Tillerson had really prioritized the European relationship certainly not of the multilateral level as much as his predecessors had done although he may have been developing a little bit in that direction whether or not he's going to make any difference to policy though is another story and of course that's another issue how much did he and his staff immediate start had to do with the development of US policy it doesn't seem that they had a great deal to do with it it's coming from elsewhere yeah because the French and UK diplomats James said that he never returned their calls or set up meetings and one would think that these are very basic tenants of diplomacy that a top diplomat should have well I think he was probably on a learning curve as the other participants have said he implied he didn't have a lot of experience and diplomacy before coming in and his networks of course are elsewhere although they are importantly it works that he has without any question but well he was some I'm not sure how far up the learning curve he had got but I'm afraid it's going to have to start all over again at least so far is dealing with European countries in the European Union is concerned now for a successor absolutely okay well let's look at his successor Glenn what do we know about Mike Pompeo why did he get the job well he got the job because he is an enthusiastic cheerleader for Donald Trump's ardent nationalism isolationism and opposition to the classic positions of American foreign policy domestic policy and and the political structures I think it's very important to to state clearly that we all are in danger of normalizing what are extraordinary and dangerous views and perceptive perceptions it should frankly be a completely disqualifying fact when someone denies science and Pompeyo says he doesn't really accept global warming it should be a a disqualifying fact when someone spends and Rises his career and rises to prominence i championing ning the Benghazi investigations which were clear to anyone who spent five minutes as a foreign policy professional were a setup to destroy a political opponent similarly with the birther thing he was about Barrack Obama's birth place of birth that was a transparent lie so one who makes his career in these things really should have no place in public affairs and yet now he is one of the premier officials in the United States Michael to what extent do you agree with that that Pompeo has already in many people's eyes disqualified himself for this role well I think it was a well articulated argument I'm glad we have it on the floor I'm gonna give Pompeo a little bit more of a chance partly because we have no choice at least I'm not a senator so I have no choice and I assume the Senate will confirm him but also I think that Pompeo while he does have some troubling aspects to his past was also first in his class at West Point was a distinguished US Army officer has a lot of intellectual firepower but he's going to have to make a transition from being essentially in the opposition as he was during his time in Congress and going after President Obama on issues where he I think overdid it I agree with that assessment and also now where he's been the CIA director and he could sort of report in a dour way on the state of the world and often blame President Obama's policies for that sorry state of things but now he's going to have to actually make constructive new proposals on issues like North Korea and Iran which as we all know are very fraught and could go in very bad directions Pompeyo is not going to have the luxury or the liberty of just complaining about where these current situations and policies are he's going to have to help the president move forward so it's a big test for him and I do agree that he's gonna have to handle himself differently in the future compared to how he has in the past the only difference I would have with my colleague on the panel is that I still am somewhat hopeful that Pompeo can do so given his abilities and his attributes what we'll have to see we've already established that when you're in these top jobs within the white house your relationship with Trump is crucial the personal chemistry counts Trump has said of Pompeo that they're always on the same wavelength but do you think Michael that that's quite concerning to hear that because a will Pompeo ever dare to disagree with him and B if he does is he out on idea oh he'll definitely feel free to disagree the question is will he and Trump figure out a modus operandi where these kind of disagreements happen privately and where Pompeo picks his battles carefully and you know I think secretary mattis is not a person who always just supports Trump's initial instincts after all when Trump came into office he wanted to disband or at least weaken a lot of US alliances he wanted to throw up huge tariffs on many different countries and certainly on the alliance issue and on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Syria and elsewhere mattis Eltham Utley had a lot of influence over Trump in that first year but he he had his disagreements quietly and he chose his words carefully and I think that's the sort of thing that Pompeo is gonna have to do if he wants to be successful now he and Trump probably agree on a lot of their world views but that doesn't answer the question of what do you do about Iran if you don't like the deal well great what are you gonna do about it and and so on questions like that it's not enough that they happen to instinctively agree they're gonna have to fashion some successful policies together and that means some degree of occasional disagreement will be necessary okay well let's look a little bit more at the Iran deal James Trump hates it the Europeans are in favor of it how do we see Pompeo moving this situation forward well I think he is on record as being very skeptical about the deal and I imagine that he has views which are very close to that of the President and of course for the last couple of months there has been quite a lot of activity going on especially in regards to contacts across the Atlantic with the e3 not so much with the European Union itself I must say even though the European Union was the coordinating agency for all of this in the first place which has been one of the problems because the recognition of the European Union's role as European Union and all of this has always been very weak even under mr. Tillerson Linea a lot of contacts going on at the moment to see how we can reach some sort of understanding as to how to flank the Iran nuclear deal but I think it's very very clear and you've heard this from Paris from London from Berlin and from Brussels from all of the principles that Europe is committed to doing all it can to stick by the deal we do believe in it and I think there's a very robust common foreign policy approach from Europe when it comes to the jcpoa now it's important to try to find ways in which we I say we can flank it and there are things I know that are being worked on at the moment but in terms of abrogating the deal or undermining the deal the hope has got to be that mr. Pompeo will bring let's say some solid military civilian thinking one thing I would just add to this to what the others have said and it's been made the point has been made elsewhere there may be a difficult with language with diplomatic language speaking to the US administration now as all of the principles on the foreign policy side are essentially from a military background Tillotson was the last of the civilians that may cause some difficulties in terms of understanding on the more civilian side of these operations going forward the only civilian left in the game it seems in the u.s. is mr. Trump himself and he's a very special sort of civilian he certainly is then with this talk of these military men I mean I was listening to an interview today from someone in Iran who was saying that without this agreement when the u.s. pulls out of it let's say it collapses that the EU can't hold it together he was saying that there is war possible between the u.s. and Iran do you agree with that could that be possible I think we're a long way from war happily with Iran and the United States happy but things will become the situation between the United States and Iran and in the Middle East and globally will become substantially more unstable if the nuclear agreement is abrogated by the United State it's 75 years ago one of the great minds of the 20th century a French philosopher and political commentator named Raymond Aron early model right after the liberation of Paris had a meeting with I think the then Foreign Minister and he was a young man Aaron was and he said everything is going wrong and this is broken now that is wrong why is the government screwing all this or stuff and things should be different and he went on and on and on talking to as much more experienced or professional and then he finally subsided and the Foreign Minister said well that's so very good mr. Aaron but what would you do and say yeah everyone took that lesson with him because it's easy to sit on the end of the barstool and find that everything is broken and doesn't work right but then what do you do and the Iranian agreement has has achieved frankly what would amount to just about a generation of stability and not development no development by Iran of nuclear weapons and foreign affairs generation is an eternity the situation changes every day but if it doesn't change in his stable of regeneration you've achieved an historic success so to abrogate this with no plan B or nothing likely but to increase destabilization and the increased likelihood that Saudi Arabia Turkey and Egypt would receive nuclear weapons by cozying up even more with Pakistan is frankly lunacy okay let's turn our attention to an area where there has been action quite significant and surprising action that's so with North Korea Michael Tillison is a you mentioned before he wanted direct talks between Donald Trump and Kim jong-un so he would be supporting this Trump Kim summit that is due to take place sometime before May wouldn't he well I certainly am hopeful about it a lot of people are wary I'm I'm wary myself but some people are downright opposed to it I think we should be a little more hopeful than that at least we're not in a constantly escalating spiral of threat and negativity and bluster like we were for most last year along with all the missile and nuclear tests now there's always a chance of a catastrophic failure of the summit that leads to then even worse dynamics after than before so I think both leaders need to go in with realistic expectations and with an awareness that the idea of a deal on denuclearization is an extreme long shot I think to the point of not really being a realistic attainable objective in this round but I do hope that we can establish a process whereby at least perhaps we cap the North Korean nuclear and missile arsenals in a verifiable way in exchange for some modest lifting of UN sanctions that kind of a deal maybe some discussion of what kind of an international implementation force would have to go along with an ultimate denuclearization pact and a peace treaty down the road some of this conversation to me is much preferable to the alternative so I'm glad that secretary teller said ultimately prevailed on the president in this sense and that president Trump seems at least willing to go ahead with the summit again we have to see a lot of preparation between now and then so the president's aware of how the summit could lead to a bad deal or fail and that he not go in with unrealistic expectations but for all my criticisms of Donald Trump I do think he's a reasonably experienced negotiator and I think he has a gut feel for how talks can go well or badly so I think there's a good chance that he'll be reasonably well prepared within the next two months okay that's certainly something we're gonna keep an eye on I want to turn our attention back now to the State Department James is the EU thinking that perhaps now with Pompeo in line with Trump we're gonna see a State Department that's more in line with the White House administration and therefore get more and more clear foreign policy coming out of the u.s. well it does seem as if mr. Pompeo could be and a more effective mouthpiece for the president which is very important the typical he is what is coming out of the mouth and which takes us back to policy so for example very soon we're going to be dealing with a new peace plan for the Middle East I think it's coming on in the next few days all being well quite how that is going to work and how it's going to be negotiated especially after the Jerusalem announcement and all the other developments that have been happening in the last month or two is anybody's guess and it is something of course which is very close to the political and economic heart of Europe as well how we're going to engage with that particular plan is m't very difficult to see how we can make progress going forward of course we have to wait for the details of the plan to come out but by all accounts it's going to be a very very difficult uphill struggle going forward on that and well on career of course there the EU is not part of the initiative we I think the EU everybody wishes it well we hope it works well but just one point there there is a crossover between Korea and Iran people have made this point many times before if your partner is seen to be a pending undermining denuclearization agreement elsewhere in the world that may well have a knock-on effect for the way in which the Koreans will approach the Americans under these circumstances and let's remember the meeting and career I think is slated for May which is also the month when the president says he won't recertify the Iranian agreement the jcpoa okay I'm afraid we are running out of time quite rapidly I do want to spare a thought though for the new CIA director Jean ahah spell glenwood what do you think about her well I spent my career in the agency and I was intimately involved in the enhanced interrogation program as some may be aware and worked in the same outfit as as Gena Haspel and I have said that anyone she's a talented officer and has been quite successful I admire but someone who has been associated at the high level in the design the implementation and the management of quote the enhanced interrogation program which is torture and represents their afterwards the United States at a senior level sends a hideous message I'm afraid for Jeanne as future that that's simply the case and so to put her in a position as she is now being nominated I think sends a terrible message she's got 30 seconds left Michael overall is this a good shake up yeah I'm a little more forgiving of both Geena and Glenn himself than that Glenn seems to have been I think that they were doing what they were asked to do it was a controversial period in American foreign policy and intelligence I don't agree with the methods but I also think they were used on a very small number of people and it was more importantly because of political leadership asking the CIA to do that I don't think that particular episode sums up Gina's attributes or abilities so I'm supportive of her candidacy it has been fascinating speaking to all of you thanks so much for joining us here on Inside Story Michael O'Hanlon James Moran and Glenn Karl and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website that's aljazeera.com but further discussion do you go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com for /aj Inside Story because our join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me laura Kyle and the whole team here bye for now
