even more former students are now coming forward alleging that GOP Congressman Jim Jordan knew about sexual assault that was taking place at Ohio State while he served as the assistant wrestling coach and that he did nothing we want to give you the information they've presented former student athlete Sean Daly told NBC Thursday he was groped a number of times by dr. Richard Strauss while he was at Ohio State during the mid-90s Daly said he was too embarrassed to report the abuse directly to Jordan who worked as an assistant coach but said Jordan was part of conversations about Strauss's systemic abuse of student-athletes Sean Daly went on to say Jimmy's a good guy but to say that he had no knowledge of it I would say that's kind of hurtful and additionally former UFC world champion Mark Coleman came forward saying that he thought there was quote no way Jordan didn't know about the abuse and specifically he said there's no way unless he's got dementia or something that he's got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State I have nothing but respect for this man I love this man but he knew as far as I'm concerned and so that's actually something even before these most recent two there had already been multiple students who came forward they all indicated that they really liked Jim Jordan but that in this particular case they're saying there were conversations he was a part of he knew about it others have said they directly talked to him about it all of them on his side except in the area where he helped to cover for a doctor who apparently molested hundreds if not more than a thousand students over the course of more than a decade again to go to the defense that he did Jim Jordans putting up and also saying the timing is where we mentioned the timing yesterday to tommy's word because you know about I have a powerful position Paul Ryan's leaving maybe I could be up for the speakership all that good stuff one of the one of the victims alleged victims of this said yeah man I liked Jim Jordan I supported him in his campaign I'm a Republican but this is weird thing how sexual assault victims and the Republican Party just one kind of goes a little bit more than the other to this particular guy but when it comes to guys who aren't elected and need to of holding on to their power it doesn't matter anymore like well you know I'm an elected official like sexual assault it's something I don't really care about right now I'm worried about myself but guys who call themselves Republicans for them for agenda or policies there like this isn't a policy I support it's weird how I have this independent thought about something like sexual assault so you can't just lump everybody in the same group and say all they must hate me they must be libs but that's what they'll say to the general public and we're supposed to buy that all right and I hate when people bring up the timing because the timing doesn't matter we've heard that conversation a lot when it came to Bill Cosby the timing does not matter it does not matter when people decide to go public about something that was personal to them something that happened to them what matters is that it happened and someone in charge didn't do anything about it someone who was a boss someone you know an assistant coach is the leader of an organization is a leader did not protect students and it doesn't matter when it doesn't matter that someone said hey you're right heat this person who didn't protect students who were being molested cannot take over for Paul Ryan and it doesn't matter that it took them this much to come out and say it it's just the fact that it's that this thing should have happened yeah it should even matter when they come out about it it shouldn't have happened and the same conversation happened when in with Penn State everyone all of those people knew all of those people knew and you have people saying I told them and the problem is when especially with little boys are assaulted or teenage boys or early you know 20s men are assaulted people and even the men themselves it's so normalized to keep that quiet that they're not mad at the people who were supposed to protect them yeah and what does that clock look like what does that count down clock look like of when it's okay to come up with it what goes into you saying like 10 years is when after that I don't care yeah and end the utley all the other side of that coin is then they never bring it up and this guy gets to become Speaker of the House and Roy Moore gets to be a senator from the state of Alabama and and all these other people get to do terrible things because they people kept quiet for too long don't we want justice doesn't matter where we want it as soon as possible but law and order and what what are they expecting the kids to do like these are these are 17 year old kids apparently this doctor is so beloved that despite the fact that he'd been molesting hundreds of kids they knew about it they did nothing who were they aside with if it comes to an actual conflict between a student who steps forward goes with it I don't know the the head of the university or something like that you got your scholarship on the line exactly the the rest of your life theoretically and the idea that all of these kids they just decide you know all of them despise Jim Jordan so much that they're willing to potentially hurt their reputation maybe like people might start to hate them to come forward now to say something against yes this former UFC world champion he's just trying to get famous that's why he's talking about it weights him so much when he says I respect Jim Jordan I love Jim the first guy Sean Daly that might visit me saying the name right but he considers him a friend he's donated to his campaigns before yeah doesn't matter or against another one of most of what he said he didn't even see it as abuse because he didn't want to jeopardize his career and all that stuff it happened so regularly they were like well this isn't really abuse I mean he's just kind of weird again so this is one of the victims let alone someone who was covering up you can even come out and say you're not man it was the kind of a bad thing I felt weird about it but I regret that I was going with the sign of the times and it was just a thing that happened again with the Cosby allegations and all that stuff it was seen as something that people just did and it was funny for these rape jokes and actual counts of rape so what benefit do you have first off to tell the truth about what happened when I say the reason why you didn't say anything about it but then when the Michigan State stuff for learn a skimpy go madness is maybe it was abuse maybe I've been abused a lot of people don't even realize it because of how regular it was so on top of it then you have the present United States back in this guy up so what fun is it we're now going up against the president who said I'm not sure if you can get to this but said let's play shrunk yeah I don't believe them at all I believe have you talked about Jim Jordan yes a Jerry put together a mash-up you come forward and you will expect that the people in power now will never ever listen to you as demonstrated in this matchup Roger Ailes is he helping you is he advising you well I don't want to comment but he's been a friend of mine for a long time and I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining I know how much he's helped them and even recently it's very sad because he's a very good person I've always found him to be just a very very good person it was very sad when we heard about it and certainly he's also very sad now he also as you probably know he says he's innocent and I think you have to remember that he said first wrongly yesterday that he's innocent if you look at what what is really going on and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours he totally denies it he says it didn't happen and you know you have to listen to him also you're talking about he said 40 years ago this did not happen so you know so you know you know if someone's accused of a crime and they say they didn't do it yes shrug your shoulders you don't know what could possibly happen I mean remember there he's he's talking about a group of men one who's alleged should have tried to rape women one who beat his girlfriend one who went on dates and tried to molest underage girls and universally as long as they've been polite to him in the past he is going to go with them and I will say what's interesting about this particular case because of course he also defends Jim Jordan now I assumed that Republicans just don't listen to women because they generally don't they're suspicious of women they kind of ate them know they know this is the men either it is just about protecting their own they don't care if it's if it's a woman if it's a former UFC world champion they're all liars if they're talking about my people when you go back to where do you remember those kind of town halls they were having of people who were calling fourteen-year-old women girls fast and this and that but essentially a lot of them were saying it's I forgive him if this did happen I think it's better to forgive him than have a Democrat in his spot or so instinct yeah some people don't care you viciously have to reveal your your true motivations if if all the evidence piles up on you you find that you're defending a top molester and you'll watch you watch Jim Jordan statements slide and slide as it's harder and harder to refuse evidence can I feel that yes so this is this came out while we were actually doing the show allegedly allegedly no apparently Jim Jordan was talking with Bret Baier in an interview about the accusations and said quote conversations in a locker room are different from reported allegations of abuse I'm out that he went from I didn't know nothing there was nothing to well maybe we talked about it but that's not formal or anything when you are an administrator when you are in charge of students conversations in a locker room that are you I think I want to say if you are some sort of a teacher or a coach that you are you have like an Audi or an automatic reporter like that that has to be the law so when someone even jokingly says this in a locker room you have to take it seriously is it a joke I doubt it was a joke yeah I bet this guy was like this is really happening and it happens to be in the locker room because that's where they see each other maybe the conversations you talking about in the locker room is someone saying stop molesting me yeah oh that's conversations in a locker room and it's already over it's already done that move from the CNN interview when he's in the park going up I've never heard of any allegations of this kind whatsoever it's interesting the timing I get what you mean it's not the time if the timings weird two conversations in a locker room it is over that is and that is an admission of guilt there and it'll shift more
