“What is unfathomable is Jamie
took a bullet and is dead.
I don’t know what I do next.
My wife is home.
We are broken.
But I can tell
you: Don’t tell me,
there’s no such thing
as gun violence.
It happened in
Parkland.”
“No more guns.”
“No more guns.”
“No more guns.”
“No more guns.”
“No more guns.”
“As your sheriff,
I will implement the full
powers of the office,
the Broward Sheriff’s office.
My friends who came with 
me here tonight, elected officials.
And they have no choice, but
we will introduce
common-sense gun
laws that make our
streets safer.”
“We must
hold other people’s
elected officials accountable.
We must make sure
that they hear us.”
“This is our home.
And this is where we will
not be intimidated by evil.
We have amazing students,
awesome administrators
and incredible teachers.
Everyone at Stoneman Douglas carries 
a special place in my heart.
I feel weak thinking about
my beloved high school
and this tragedy occurring.”
“This makes no sense.
This is impossible.
My girl, my 14-year-old baby.
And for those of you
who know my Jamie,
she was the life of the party.
She was the energy in the room.
She made people laugh.
And yes, sometimes
she made us cry,
but she was always known. She
always made her presence felt.”
