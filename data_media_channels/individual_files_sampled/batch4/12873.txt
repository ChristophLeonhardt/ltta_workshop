so I want to contrast today situations in which Americans feel that sexual harassment mala station are just wrong wrong wrong and E wrong wrong and situations in which apparently we don't care anymore so here's the situation which we feel that it is wrong wrong wrong and E wrong wrong if you have somebody who's applying to your college football coaching position then even the mildest suspicion they may have covered up for sexual molestation means that you cannot get the job I speak of course of Greg Schiano Greg Schiano it was was about to be hired at the University of Tennessee's the Ohio State defense coordinator and Schiano has been very successful in that position he was about to sign a contract at the University of Tennessee to take over their head coaching position but then a lot of people started to protest and they started protest because Greg Schiano was working over at Penn State when Jerry Sandusky the then defensive coordinator was stooping little boys in the in the showers and when the Paterno Joe Paterno was allegedly allowing that to occur or at least not doing enough to stop it and there was one allegation by then it might McQueary who was one of the guys working on the defensive staff that he had heard through the grapevine that Schiano had seen Sandusky molesting a kid and done nothing about it now that allegation was unsubstantiated it was denied by Schiano it was denied also by another member of the defense of coordinating staff who supposedly McQuarrie had heard this from in the first place so this is really kind of dicey stuff to begin with but even the implication that Schiano must have known about it or may have known about it meant that the people at University of Tennessee went nuts so all of Tennessee's major politicians said you can't hire Schiano they have a big rock at University of Tennessee I know about it cuz I was just visiting University of Tennessee at Knoxville they've this big rock where you can paint messages on the rock and one of the things they painted was Schiano covered up child rape at Penn State so they ended up withdrawing their offered to drag Schiano because obviously we don't want people who are alleged to have covered up child molestation no matter how weak the allegation coaching a major college football program he should have run for Congress that would have been a lot better for him if he had run for Congress because the Democrats who spent the last month saying that it's time to finally wipe out sexual harassment it's time to finally wipe out sexual abuse and you know where we should start we should start with the Alabama Senate race let's start with that kiddy porn guy Roy Moore let start with that guy let's start with him you know we're so into the anti sexual harassment campaign now say the Democrats were even willing to throw the desiccated corpse of Bill Clinton under the bus he's no longer useful to us we'll just take that skeleton and toss it right under the grinding wheels of that bus time for him to go Teddy Kennedy that dudes been bloated and dead for a long time so if we have to say some bad things about Teddy Kennedy okay well we will set a new standard a brand new standard and now the day of light is coming and there will be no more sexual harassment there'll be no more sexual abuse well finally come to a conclusion in this great saga of women being victimized throughout the United States in positions of power well that lasted for like a week so congratulations Democrats your moral stand lasted for having less than a week actually because first there were allegations about senator Al Franken and then there were allegations about John Conyers so the let's start with the Conyers allegations because this is truly stunning stuff so John Conyers is an eighty eight-year-old Congress person he is apparently senile there there reports that he had literally walked into meetings in his pajamas John Conyers he's not been around for quite a while he was apparently a a guy who sexually harassed women many years ago as well at least those were the allegations in any case it has now come out that there was a settlement that Conyers made with a former member of his office in which she accused him basically of propositioning her and when she refused he fired her was basically the allegations ended up settling out for like 30 grand there's also a lawsuit that have been filed against Conyers there was an on-the-record allegation by the Washington Post as a big report by The Washington Post all of this happens and Conyers is 88 years old now make no mistake this is what's astonishing okay so yeah I'll talk about Roy Moore in a little while but let's just put it this way the Republicans have said Roy Moore can't lose that seat why can't Roy Moore to lose that seat because if you go from 52 to 51 votes in the Senate it's gonna be very difficult to pass anything plus what happens if there's a Supreme Court vacancy and you need that vote so a Senate seat is super important and right now if more we're to lose he's in the middle of an election cycle a Democrat would take that seat and the Democrat would then be able to vote against the priorities of Republicans okay it's an argument I don't think it's the world's strongest argument but it is an argument this is the binary argument we saw during the 2016 election it's the exact same argument they were having it again I didn't buy then I don't buy it now but okay let's assume that that's an argument I'll tell you what's not an argument let's say that Roy Moore were a sitting u.s. senator and let's say the governor of his state were a Republican and now he could be thrown out of office and the Republican governor would simply appoint a Republican replacement or let's say that there was a congressperson a Republican Congress person who was in the midst of a sex scandal and that person would be thrown out of office there'd be a special election it's a very Republican districts and a Republican would be elected to replace that person in all likelihood wouldn't that sort of take away the the IVA even the argument that there's a binary choice well this is what's so incredible about what the Democrats are doing Republicans maybe are about more you can't have Doug Jones in there again I think that I don't want suck Jones in there either I think the moral choice in Alabama is to set it out or write somebody in instead of Roy Moore but at least there's an argument that the Senate seats important there is no argument that Al Franken Senate seat is important because it's not there's a Democratic governor of Minnesota right now there's no argument that John Conyers his seat is important he's in like a d-plus 1000 district John Conyers has been reelected for 22 straight terms I believe the guy runs like a medieval fiefdom okay if he's thrown out guess what a Democrat will replace him Democrats still refuse to throw Conyers under the bus this is amazing stuff it just demonstrates that all this talk about sexual harassment sexual assault sexual misconduct it's all a bunch of hooey when it comes from politicians they're all lying they say they pretend to care about this stuff they do not care about this stuff one iota and the proof is coming from your very very feminist House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi then came out and she called John she's asked about John Conyers and whether John Conyers should go and remember Nancy Pelosi is the first female Speaker of the House she held up the big gavel she brought in all of her grandkids the ones who had not been aborted and they all stood around her and it was all just glorious and wonderful she's such a feminist icon Nancy Pelosi now she specifically asked about John Conyers who has many allegations of sexual harassment against him by Chuck Todd and here is Nancy Pelosi's answer you said there's now a zero tolerance John Conyers what does that mean for him right now let's say it around we are strengthened by due process just because someone is accused you and it was that one accusation is it - I think there has to be John Conyers is an icon in our country if he has done a great deal to protect women violence against women Act which the left wing right wing is now quoting me as praising him for his work on that and he did great work on that but the fact is as John reviews his case which he knows which I don't I believe he will do I believe that he was excuse me may I finished my sense that he will do with the right thing you'll do the right thing so here's what he did he stepped down from the House Judiciary Committee which the Democrats wanted him to do anyway because they want somebody who is not senile in charge of that committee but when she says we don't know the accusers how many there are what they've said well we know there's a settlement we know there was a Washington Post story full of allegations we you're calling on Roy Moore to step down from his Alabama Senate race over very you know over allegations that are quote-unquote similarly vague because they're not vague right Nancy Pelosi great feminist hero says John Conyers an icon II must a and then she goes even further she defends Franken she defends Bill Clinton and then she calls Roy Moore a child molester I don't know how you can hold a standard of evidence that says that Al Franken is innocent Bill Clinton is innocent Roy Moore is guilty that standard of evidence does not exist obviously it is a generational change but let me just say the concern that we had then was that they were impeaching the President of the United States and for something that had nothing to do with the performance of his duties and trying to take him out for that reason why do you think the reaction was different by women on Bill Clinton and I say that because it does seem as if frankly when you watch some of the reactions by the president in defending Roy Moore or at least overlooking the allegations against Roy Moore that were you putting politics ahead of your personal disgust no but we're talking about a child molester Oh President Clinton was accused of being a sexual predator well I mean or even rape why don't we talk instead about how we go forward nobody is proud of President Clinton's behavior at the time why don't we talk about how we go forward because you haven't gone forward you're defending John Conyers and Al Franken right now forget about 20 years ago now write all these Democrats who are now saying oh I we would have been in favor of Bill Clinton's impeachment they're full of absolute crap because now they have the opportunity not only to do this but to do it without any sort of political repercussion that's what's truly astonishing to me right the political loyalty runs so deep in Washington DC the partisan tribalism runs so deep in Washington DC it doesn't even matter if you're gonna lose something now I was under the weird misimpression over the last couple weeks that all of this was about losing a seat or losing political power it's not even about that it's about pure partisan loyalty it's about John Conyers has a D by his name it doesn't matter if he'd be replaced by another person with a D by his name so long as he has the D by his name Nancy Pelosi will stand by his side she'll stand by Bill Clinton's side she has no good answers to these questions if they want Roy Moore elected there's no better way of getting Roy Moore elected to the United States Senate than for Democrats to do exactly what they this weekend it gets even worse and I'll show you talk about it in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriots supply so listen the government recommends that in case of natural disaster you have some food on hand in your house that can take you through a period that could be pretty brutal here in California there been reports about some activity along the San Andreas Fault if God forbid there were to be a major earthquake the government recommends that you're supposed to have a certain amount of food available in your house so you don't have to run out to the grocery store or in case emergency services can't get to you that's why you need to speak with my friends over at my Patriot supply you can get their 102 serving survival food kit for just 99 bucks it includes breakfasts lunches and dinners it is shipped to your home office your home or your office for free order a kit for yourself now call eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen 888 eight oh three fourteen thirteen or go online to prepare with been calm prepare with been calm again the emergency food lasts for like twenty five years in storage so you buy it once you forget about it and then when there's an emergency you're glad that you did you spent ninety nine bucks and have one hundred and two servings of survival food for just $99 really good deal for making sure your family is preserved in safety again eight eight eight eight oh three 14 13 eight eight eight eight oh three 14 13 or prepare with been Commons prepare with been calm yeah another one of these Democrats demonstrating her hypocrisy is a woman named Jackie Speier Jackie Speier is a Democratic Representative and Miss Speier is she has said that there are multiple sexual predators basically in Congress and John Conyers is not one of them she has said that she know about all of the people know who these people are she's from California here is her discussing John Conyers right here's what she had to say about John Conyers the other day do we actually have a clip or it's just the graphic okay so here's what she actually said she said quote I think the allegations are very serious and that's why there's the ethics committee needs to move forward very swiftly now wait years but very swiftly staff up if necessary to determine whether or not those allegations are accurate if they're accurate I do believe congressman Conyers should step down okay the if they're accurate routine the if they're accurate routine basically suggest that now there needs to be a full trial before we decide in public affairs whether or not somebody needs to step down if that were the case Bill Clinton was never convicted of anything Hillary Clinton was never convicted of anything David Vitter was never convicted of anything you know that all these all these people Anthony Weiner at the time he design had not been convicted of anything that's not how politics works politics is not about the idea that you have to go through a full due process trial that's what you do to avoid prison politics is about who do you want representing you and if we're all gonna new head now have the standard that you have to be convicted of a crime in order for you to be removed from office then I guess that's our standard from now on but it just means that our politicians are basically going to be worse and worse people it's pretty astonishing right and Conyers of course has said that he'll step aside the Judiciary Committee it means nothing again for the for the tenth time John Conyers leaving would mean nothing to the Democrats John Conyers his district is heavily Democratic now yeah but that's not the only instance of the Democrats doing this over the weekend over the weekend the Democrats came out and defended Al Franken so Al Franken has come out and he said he's ashamed but he's not stepping down he's ashamed of his behavior he said that he can still be effective he said quote I've let a lot of people down and I'm hoping I can make it up to them and gradually regain their trust right this is what he said on Sunday by phone he said I'm looking forward to getting back to work tomorrow so no he's not stepping down it doesn't matter there's an actual picture of him trying to grab a sleeping woman's breasts it doesn't matter that many many women have now come out and said they grabbed their butts he says by the way his defense of himself is that he's a hugger that he's a hugger did his hands hug asses I'm confused here is Al Franken defending himself you know III can't say that that hasn't happened I take thousands and thousands of pictures we sometimes in crowded and chaotic situations I can't say I haven't done that and I I'm I am very sorry if these women experience that okay experience they didn't experience it you grab their butts like dude you know what you know it takes a lot of pictures in crowded situations right hear me okay I do it all the time Mathis my producer can attest to this okay I do this all the time I'm in major crowds all the time taking pictures of lots of people including many young women not once has my hand gravitated toward their posterior you know why because that's sexual assault you're not supposed to grab people on their butts you stupid piece of crap okay and here he is saying I'm sorry if they experienced that as though it was like a hurricane it just sort of came along and swept well I'm sorry they had to experience that inevitability of life which is my hand on there but my bad hey you you don't fire the shoulders from the butt by the way it's a long way from the butt okay when I take nothing not to give like basic the knee bone is connected to the shin bone but when I say a picture with somebody and my hand is up here at their shoulder I have to travel at least two feet downward to reach an ass okay but apparently al franken's hand is so driven by gravity downward right is the heaviest hand in the world he just can't keep it up there just slides down and then he says well you know I'll apologize if these women experienced anything it's just it's just terrible I just can't you know but I'm not stepping down now leaving or anything and the Democrats are not gonna force him to leave okay and the proof is there it's all there it's pretty astonishing so all that's happened in our politics is that basically because we're such partisan tribalist because they're such loyalists now the way that it works if you even issue the remotest denial it doesn't matter if the denial is credible or not it doesn't matter if the denial is good then I'll can be the stupidest denial that you ever heard of none of it matters so long as you issue any denial of any kind that gives somebody a peg that they can hang their hat on which suggests that we don't care about this crap in the first place like even President Trump like president Trump over the weekend there's a report out this is an astonishing report there's a report out the President Trump has been going around the last few months privately questioning from the authenticity of the Access Hollywood recording no I am not kidding you remember in 2016 there was that famous tape that came out of him saying he grabbed lemon by the bleeps and they wouldn't care because you're famous right when you when you're famous they'll let you do anything and there was a tape of him talking to Billy Bush about this apparently he's been going around repeating a claim to advisors that it's not even a real take that it was manufactured okay so he's now created a conspiracy theory about a conversation in which he personally took place I'm not joking this is the thing that happened okay this is according to both ABC News and the New York Times it's not surprising because President Trump has a unique capacity to convince himself of virtually anything and any news that is bad for him he calls fake news like you know he tweeted out this is pretty hilarious after him and he tweeted this out just this morning quote we should have a contest as to which of the networks plus CNN and not including Fox is the most dishonest corrupt and or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president parentheses me they are all bad winner to receive all caps the fake news trophy come on down done it okay he never gave up actually being on a game show I do love that he is restricting your choices here to include CNN but not Fox because he likes Fox and then I like that he has to label it I like that he now calls himself your favorite president I do love that it's pretty spectacular and then he has to and then he has to put in parentheses me as though we were gonna be unclear about who he was talking about that we thought he was talking about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln that CNN and Fox had not been covering George Washington or Abraham Lincoln fairly I have to admit the guy I don't know whether he's joking or not I think he's like half joking here but that's pretty funny stuff I mean that's pretty funny it would be funnier if you weren't the President of the United States and you know had responsibilities and everything I gave you if you're just sort of a guy on Twitter but I guess that's that's sort of what he considers himself to be like this is it's pretty amazing right I do love it but this is how you wonder how we get to a point where we can ignore plausible allegations it's because this is what people think of the news Trump is actually not wrong when he says this is how people think of the news the left thinks of Fox News is a propaganda outlet the right things of CNN is a propaganda outlet therefore any allegations focused on by either one of them is going to be considered propaganda so long as it hurts your side and this brings us finally in at last to Roy Moore so well the Democrats have been working very hard to give up the moral high ground for no apparent can't I mean this is how bad they are it's a thank God for Republicans the Democrats are so bad at this I mean truly horrifying at this that they go through this whole routine with Roy Moore and then in order to save Al Franken and John Conyers both people who would be replaced by Democrats they decide to undermine any moral credibility they had Roy Moore is gonna survive not only as we're more gonna survive I would think he's gonna win now I would be very surprised if Roy Moore does not when his Alabama Senate race not because he deserves to win the Alabama Senate race but because the Democrats have set up a standard right the Democrats have set up a standard they set up in 1998 and they they they look like they were moving away from it and then they just hugged it with both hands over the weekend hug it with both hands on a woman's but over the weekend the Democrats came out and they basically said any Democrat who's accused of anything we will defend that's essentially what they say and so the Republicans are now essentially doing the same thing which is not a huge surprise right here's the RNC chair Rhonda McDaniel Rhonda Rhonda McDaniel she comes out and she says listen the voters are gonna decide which is again a cop-out right she could have some input here but she's not going to because the voters are going to decide the Alabama voters are going to have to be the judge and jury on this they're going to have to look at the women that have come forward with these very concerning allegations and then what the judge is putting forward and they're gonna have to make a decision as to whether or not they want him to represent their state in the United States Senate okay and now we know by the way that people will buy into any denial because the Democrats bought intending tonality so Nancy Pelosi on national TV saying that she doubts the women who accused John Conyers even though there is a sign settlement a sign settlement and still she's saying that she doesn't believe the accusers writerly she doesn't have enough evidence to believe the accusers so is it any wonder that were way more isn't gonna back down and that he's gonna send out his lawyers to say stuff like this here's Roy Moore's lawyer say there's campaign strategist saying that they believe Roy Moore and all of the women are lying all 9,000 women are lying and all this Jerry Springer stuff is over and I'm talking to all y'all we're not gonna do this anymore as a campaign so all you all you people run around yelling stuff at judge Moore asking these ridiculous questions I'm the chief political strategist and my advice is every time they yell something like that to you judge Moore or to the campaign just think it's the Jerry Springer Show don't answer it judge Moore's answered all the questions we believe Judge Moore we don't believe these women it's just that simple and y'all can keep trotting them out if you want to but we're not gonna talk about that okay I'm getting this by the way like when I hosted for Mark Levin the day before Thanksgiving virtually every caller agreed with this lawyer agreed with the campaign guy here that Roy Moore was innocent and all these women relying and that all of the stories were false I guess we this is now the standard that we have which is no standard at all for evidence okay like I again I've explained time and time again on the show I think that the allegations are credible and and even the bottom line is that any any argument will now be made in order to find these people Joel Pollack who is the who is the editor-at-large I guess senior editor at large now over a Breitbart my former employer which has become just a propaganda outlet for whichever chosen candidate Breitbart and Steve ban and decide is important today Joel was was doing his his propaganda work on CNN this morning talking about how judge Roy Moore could have been dating 16 year old and it was totally fine because Ringo Starr or something you know in 1973 Ringo Starr number one on the Billboard charts with the song age of 16 you're beautiful in your mind and it was a remake of an earlier song he was 30-something at the time singing about a 16 year old you want to take away Ringo Starr is you can't be serious I mean you can't be sick you can't be serious you're talking about these series we leave that Ringo Starr's song is supposed to be a nod towards allowing 30 year old men to prey on teenagers you don't believe that Joel okay so two things one the the original song was written by the Sherman Brothers and it was written for a teenager about other teenagers so there are better examples of this I mean if Joel wants to do this we actually did a full deconstructing the culture in which we cited song after song last week of older men preying on younger women so it rolls not wrong at this exists in popular culture but the question is why is that a defense of more like I I use that in my deconstructing the culture segment I use that to talk about how depraved our culture had become I didn't use that as a defense of somebody doing it my goodness but I guess this is this is where we are I guess that's a defense now ever everything's a defense now so that's very exciting stuff I'm just glad that I'm glad that we can't have people who have vague allegations of covering up for child molestation made about them sitting as the head coach at University of Tennessee because our moral standards are so high but sitting in the United States Senate different story or sitting in the United States Senate even if they be replaced by a member of their own party different story yeah I think that we may be toast here again I'm thinking that the moral credibility of the American people may be called me because listen it's not about the people in Congress anymore it's about us it's about what we tolerate in the end we are the voters what do we decide to tolerate what do we decide is it okay for people sitting there and if we have to lose a race every so often in order for everyone to have a better moral standard maybe that's an important thing maybe those moral standards are important because the fact is that if all we believe Congress is a series of people who are gonna vote for us regardless of character we're gonna have bad people who are willing to betray our interests okay bad people are bad people I don't trust people about whom these you wouldn't trust this person to babysit your child I don't know why you'd trust them to implement all of your policy decisions I guess this is the hard divide that was made in the nineteen nineties about Bill Clinton and I guess we all buy the Bill Clinton school of thought now we were gonna make noise about how we didn't but apparently we all do okay so before I go any further and talk about the stupidity I'm a bunch of people who are ripping into the New York Times for what I thought was actually a really interesting and well done piece about white supremacists

commitments which is an awesome deal you know before I get to this New York Times piece I'm just gonna need to give you a brief rundown on what's happening over at the at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because this has become an issue in the last couple of hours basically here's the story according to the Washington Post as a Republican congressman Mick Mulvaney called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a joke and said he wished it didn't exist mainly cuz it's kind of a joke and it shouldn't exist on Monday Mulvaney showed up at the agency's DC offices with the bag of doughnuts in a new title boss but after a frantic weekend of political and legal posturing Mulvaney's arrival represented a new escalation of tensions over who ultimately will lead the agency a day earlier Leandre English filed suit claiming she is the rightful Acting Director so leadership of the agency was thrown into doubt last Friday when which for Richard Cordray stepped down as CFPB director and said his chief of staff English would temporarily replace him a few hours later Trump named Mulvaney the Office of Management and Budget Director and longtime critic of the CFPB to do the job okay let's put it this way this is insane what Richard Cordray did here and what Leandre English are doing here it's crazy there are two bills that are governing okay bill number one was passed in 1998 and it says the president has the power to fill all of these vacancies right in 1998 there's a bill specifically says the president has the power to fill the vacancy and then there is the dodd-frank bill and dodd-frank bill says that the director when he steps down can appoint an interim acting director okay that may be true but the president can trump that if the president wants to fill the slot because otherwise the person is not subject to appointment the person is not subject to senatorial go ahead otherwise you have a completely unaccountable bureaucrat appointing another unaccountable bureaucrat that's not the way that separation of powers work there's an executive branch agency either the person who is appointed has to be appointed by the President and approved by the Senate or it has to be appointed by the president you don't have executive Asian's executive branch agencies that run independent of the executive branch and the legislative branch I mean I guess the contention here is that Richard Cordray becomes his magical own dictator that the minute Richard Cordray steps into that office now he has the power to appoint successors and he gets to run the place the way that he wants to run the place that's not how this works I mean Richard Cordray was appointed I believe by President Obama was the idea and Richard Cordray I mean this is a political stunt there is no question that this is a political stunt they could have fired him they didn't fire him instead they allowed him to step down but in stepping down he decided to start a political firefight because he wanted to make a name for himself and run for governor of Ohio is basically the idea again there's nothing in law that allows Richard Cordray Trump the president of the United States remember that originally Obama Obama appointed Cordray by using an unconstitutional recess appointment Democrats threatened to change the filibuster rules and Republicans surrendered this is back in 2013 and then in 2013 the Senate confirmed the guy to a five-year term but this is pretty cynical stuff the National Review has a as a good piece by Ronald Rubin on this and essentially what it says is since 2010 Republicans have argued that the CFPB's unique structure and independent agency whose single director the president can fire only four cause with guaranteed funding through federal reserve bank profits rather than the congressional appropriation process is a recipe for government abuse if not unconstitutional Cordray proved them right warned bill to Elizabeth horn is the person who made these changes through dodd-frank and court very deployed it the bureau's powerful media division dictated policy to its regulatory professionals and relentlessly exaggerated the agency's achievements and daily press releases in social media posts political operatives used the CFPB's super independence to Stonewall congressional subpoenas and hide unethical investigation tactics internal discrimination problems and other inconvenient facts Republican critics were dismissed as wall street sycophants meanwhile millions of dollars were diverted from the CFPB to Democratic allies from 2014 to 22 2017 the bureau paid eleven million dollars a year to rent office space in an Obama fundraisers building they were allowed to do this because they basically ran the place like a fiefdom again and then he entrenched with Cordray put a bunch of Democratic employees in during the first half of 2017 and then he awarded a fifteen million dollar contract to another one of Obama's friends he's been doing all the stuff and then finally Trump was gonna use the federal vacancies Reform Act of 1998 that's what I was referring to to appoint budget director Mick Mulvaney to come in and clean house at the CFPB so instead Cordray resigned and then appointed his own replacement he appointed his chief of staff the CFPB deputy director and they cited language in the dodd-frank act that the deputy director shall serve as acting director in the absence or unavailability of the director okay this is not the same thing as he steps down and you could that even the bill itself doesn't say he can appoint his own replacement it says that if he's absent or unavailable like he's overseas or something but there's no question that that Trump is gonna win this thing in court I mean if he doesn't win this thing in court is just another example of insane political activism on the part of the courts which would not actually be supremely surprising okay now meanwhile the New York Times has been accused of sympathizing with Nazis yes really the left is now eating its own which is somewhat delicious but I have to say incredibly stupid I'm gonna talk about that in

conservative and fastest-growing conservative podcast in America so demonstrating how leftist thought leads to shortsightedness with regard to fighting people even the left hates there is an article in the new york times over the weekend that's getting all sorts of blowback and there's a guy named tony Javed er you've never heard of him because you're not a white supremacist tony Javed er apparently is on a show called radio Aryan he'll call in to a show called radio Aryan and he's the founder of some white supremacist political party and he is he is a full-on neo-nazi basically and there's an article in the New York Times that basically describes him as a regular guy with horrific views what's funny is that the left finds this particularly repellents that how dare they describe him as a regular guy in many ways with disgusting political viewpoints as though everyone who has disgusting political viewpoints is you know a guy with tattoos up his neck and a swastika on his forehead like Charles Manson as though people can't hide in plain sight and as though people aren't moved from mainstream political movements into fringe political movements with relative alacrity if you want to talk about the risks of political extremism in the country you have to acknowledge that there's a group of regular people who can easily be led astray by evil people masquerading as quote-unquote normies that's what this New York Times piece does it says Tony and Maria Javed er were married this fall they registered a target on their list was a muffin pan a four drawer dresser and a pineapple slicer miss Javed her 25 was worried about an Tifa bashing up the ceremony weddings are hard enough to plan when your fiance is not an avowed white nationalist people very angry at this how dare the New York Times say they registered a target and pretend these are normal people well because a lot of people with evil beliefs mrs. zahana rents entire theory right the banality of evil is that evil people are people who are evil they're not monsters so you can identify easily and that's why you have to be on your lookout that's the whole point I don't point to this article is that you have to be on the lookout for people like Tony Javed or because Javed er has evil evil views but masquerades as a normal person right it says he is the Nazi sympathizer next door polite and low-key at a time the old boundaries of accepted political activity can seem alarmingly in flux most Americans would be disgusted in baffled by his casually approving remarks about Hitler to stay in for democracy and belief that the races are better off separate but as tattoos are innocuous pop-culture references a slice of cherry pie adorned one arm and homage to the TV show Twin Peaks okay so he's not you know he sounds like a weirdo he's a welder and they say that he's a regular guy who just believes in Nazism basically he says I don't think anyway he says I don't want you to think I'm some edgy Republican he says well flatly denouncing the concept of democracy I don't even think those things should be edgy while defending his assertion Jews run the worlds of Finance in the media and appear to be working more in line with their own interests than everybody else's his political evolution from vaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarians of fascist activists was largely fueled by the kinds of frustrations that would not seem exotic to most American conservatives so here's the New York Times trying to tie him to conservatism but the fact is that he did at NC PAC apparantly in 2015 he named rock people like Murray Rothbard who's an anarcho-capitalist and and he had he was a supporter of President Trump the point of this article is not that he's a good guy the point of this article is that he's a very bad guy who believes very bad things but can masquerade it in plain sight and the reason that's important is because listen I've dealt with enough young college kids some of whom have been seduced by the all right to know that this is how they get seduced they get seduced by the troller II and then when people say well that's really disgusting they say well you're just politically correct I'll do more of it they say well maybe the reason that people are so opposed to my point of view is because it's true maybe the reason that people are so upset when I post a holocaust meme is because the Holocaust didn't really happened and they know it and they're lying about it this is how people get sucked in I mean this guy's still young he's 25 years old but it's it's pretty it's an in-depth profile I think it's a very good profile and the fact is that the left attacking the profile is one of the reasons the left is going to lose because by attacking the profile that preventing people from truly understanding how these ideas materialize and that's that's a that's a huge mistake okay time for some things I like and then some things I hate and then we will go through a Federalist Papers so things I like over the weekend I watched an uplifting film a great Thanksgiving Day film about the Cambodian genocide it was actually it's actually a very very good film so Angelina Jolie made a she directed this she helped write the screenplay it's an adaptation of a nonfiction book by a girl who was seven years old five and then five to seven when the Cambodian genocide took place that's called first they killed my father it actually is a good thing sniffing giving movie just because be thankful you do not live in a regime like this I mean my god and be thankful it's interesting Angelina Jolie tries to make the rise of the Khmer Rouge about basically the United States and how evil the United States was for getting involved in Cambodia in the first place the truth is that the United States was bombing the Khmer Rouge until they decided to pull out of the Vietnam War one of the things that happened after the pullout from the Vietnam War was the slaughter of over a million Cambodians 25% of the population was basically murdered in Cambodia after the United States pulled out of Vietnam and then the Cambodians the Khmer Rouge went to battle with the Vietnamese communists it was there's actually a Russia China war basically the Khmer Rouge were backed by the Chinese the Vietcong were backed by the the Russians and they went to war the Vietcong ended up winning that war the Khmer Rouge were some of the worst people ever to walk the planet and in this film by Jolie Jolie had directed the movie unbroken which is based on a very good book by Laura Hillenbrand about about a guy who's a prisoner of war an American in Louise Zamperini a who's an American prisoner of war the film itself is really pedestrian the book is much better unbroken she's picked up her game because this is actually a pretty well directed film and it's really it's it's a really effective film it should be nominated for Best Picture it probably will be she should probably nominated for Best Director which is a lot to say about somebody like Angelina Jolie but it's it it's a very effective film here's your some of the preview Cambodia 1975 it's a little girl everybody's gonna party in from the US has good breath Bethenny so her father works for the Cambodian government and and then has to hide who he is it doesn't say for life both of her parents are murdered in the film is not a giveaway I mean the film is called first they killed my father it's about how these communists Orphic her horrifying ideas destroying industry there's it there's a really horrifying scene where a guy his child is sick and the Khmer Rouge won't let him use quote-unquote Western medicine for his child until goes out in steals Western medicines they kill him it demonstrates how horrific communism is and for all the people I'm left who made way for this kind of garbage for decades they should be a shit not only ashamed themselves they should live in in in a constant state of penance for pretending to the United States were the bad guys when it came to the Vietnam War the Vietcong were the bad guys the Khmer Rouge were the bad guys the United States were not the bad guys here movie his first they killed my father and it's well worth watching speaking of being grateful for freedom this video is going around last week and it really is truly incredible this is a North Korean soldier who attempts to defect and you will see the North Koreans they they've basically they built basically a wall to keep people in they shoot this guy seven times as he was trying to leave he survived amazingly but here is the here's some video of it they were just a few feet behind him they fired more than 40 bullets but failed to kill or capture him and tonight the North Korean soldiers who couldn't keep their comrade from pulling off a dramatic escape last week are facing the fallout a South Korean lawmaker tells CNN nearly all the North Korean soldiers present along the border that day have been replaced human rights observers say being replaced could be the least of their worries meaning that they might be shot so this guy actually ran away and he made it to the other side if you have to you know for all the people who are talking in the United States these actresses and actors talking about awfully America of trumps elected you shut up it really shut up the border is open you can leave whenever you want it's fine go okay the countries where the countries where truly evil is going on they don't let you leave they shoot you if you try to leave okay other things that I like so I want to say thank you to the New York Times seriously they ran a very fair piece from from a reporter named Sabrina tavernas who is actually I think a genuinely objective reporter trying to do the right thing Sherrod a piece called ben shapiro a provocative gladiator battles to win young conservatives it was a full page article in the new york times over over the Thanksgiving Day weekend it was on Friday and the article I thought was very fair they quoted some of my critics I know that she had tried to reach out to some of the people on the Left who are my critics now some of them wouldn't answer her but in any case this drove left utterly insane and to demonstrate just how intolerant the left are that the left leftist are this is pretty astonished they run this article that is essentially an objective look at you know our role here at the Daily wire in the conservative movement what I do it's about the podcast it talked about it at length and I think it's a pretty fair compelling look so Eric Bullard who's just a scuzzbag beyond all skies bags longtime nemesis day under bright Bart's and Andrews to mock him for for being a George Soros tool Erik Bullard tweeted something out about how is a puff piece on the former Breitbart bottom feeder number of critics liberals demo'd in peace zero well I mean you can find leftist to criticize me all over the Internet it really is not particularly difficult including Eric Butler this is my favorite part I was trying to favor at this I only have one favorite on Twitter it is Chris Evans saying he genuinely dislikes me so I really wanted to favorite this but Debra Messing unfortunately blocked me Debra Messing the the horrific actress from Will and Grace has never been in anything since since she can't actually out of a paper bag but she tweeted out that this article about me is why she canceled her subscription to The New York Times she actually canceled her subscription to The New York Times because they ran an objective article about me that wasn't a that wasn't a hit job so one article about a conservative that isn't a hit job in Debra Messing cancels her subscription I mean to be fair I thought her show Will & Grace is absolute crap but I didn't cancel my cable because of it I think she's a terrible terrible actress but I didn't like to say I'm not using TiVo anymore so well done Debra Messing clear apparently then she spent the weekend painting a live horse or something so I'm afraid that that article may have driven her a little bit out of her mind so I feel a little bit bad for that I'm sorry Debra Messing that your life was ruined by having to read views with which you disagree I guess life is very tough when their multi-million dollar actress who hasn't made anything in 15 years and now is getting to be cast in a reboot of your own garbage show in the first place okay time for some things that I hate all right first thing that I hate I meant to do this last week now I have to do it there is a video that came out showing professional cuddling I talked about a little bit but I need to actually show you the video of the professional cuddling this is just horrendous and never should happen in the planet these are people who are being hired to cuddle with other people like strangers it says this person is a total stranger to me her job is to give people Huddle's she's a professional cut list during their cut less session it's it's a safe space it's a space where they get through explore touch more likely than not they're not getting the level of touch that they need in their everyday life I'm just about to go for my very first company's session and personally I have been going through a tough time lately so I'm very curious to see if this session will help me in any way this is the session that starts by setting some ground rules she asked you to think about what you're most comfortable with as a first timer becoming relaxed wasn't easy because why do you have any strangers says how would you like me to join you and she's like um I wouldn't as I had to rely on this cuddle Sutra book for inspiration okay okay no yes it's pretty awkward okay then this goes on it gets better with time though why would you why why why why why sorry what dude okay so we're living in the society were worried about sexual harassment and sexual abuse you hire a professional cut list a Rando to come over your house and they're professional what makes you a professional Cutlass like what makes you good at this I'm just wondering do you go to Cutlass school you get a PhD in cuddling and what in the what in the actual F okay get a boyfriend you know get it get a dog like seriously people you know what's happened we've sozin we've so much separated sex and touch from from emotion that now we're trying to reach those things back together but without actually forming emotional connection with the person you have to hire the person nor to cuddle you I mean like when guys do used to do this it was called a whorehouse when women do it with other women then it's just cuddling me there's nothing sexual going on I guess but it's like it's a random person that you're hugging like what in the world and then we needed a tough enough gang I think we're gonna need to toughen up I'm not sure Western civilization can survive the onslaught of reality if you're hiring people to lie next to you and cuddle you who you don't know what in the world okay I had other things that I hate but I'm sorry I have too much hate for this I there's no more room for others so now we're gonna do Federalist number five so every Monday we've been going through Federalist paper gradually making our way through all of the Federalist Papers in Federalist number five is by John Jay remember this beginning of the Federalist Papers is all about why we shouldn't be multiple nations as opposed to one nation so John Jay talks about how this would actually cause internal dissension inside the nation what you would actually end up with his wars on the American continent between the various nations on the continent he says whenever and from whatever causes it might happen and happen it would that any one of these nations or Confederacy's should rise on the scale of political importance much above the degree of her neighbors that moment with those neighbors beholden with envy and with fear in other words one region would probably be stronger than the other region and then you'd end up with Civil War and he predicted that he in this Federalist paper he basically predicts the Civil War he says that the North would probably out her in the south and this would cause the South to become jealous of the north and this would cause the north to become overreaching and then you would end up with a with a war between the two sides even if they were separate countries so secession would not actually solve the problem it would just end up leading to war more easily now obviously he's not talking about slavery here which was the major issue in the Civil War but what I'm saying is that he was predicting conflict between North and South based on regional differences and no national Allegiance he says considering our distance from Europe it would be more natural for these Confederacy's to apprehend danger from one another than from distant nations and therefore the each of them should be more desirous to guard against the others by the aid of foreign alliances than say guard against foreign dangers by alliances between themselves in other words the north and the south wouldn't create an alliance against Britain the north would ally with with the French and the south would ally with Britain and then they'd go to war and then sooner or later you'd end up with French and British troops on American shores who are basically serving the interests of one of the regimes or the other and that's he'd get a reinvasion of the United States by the powers of Europe it's an interesting argument it is also provocative in the sense that it reminds us that a unified foreign policy in the United States was not a guarantee right there was a point where it was not clear that the United States was actually going to be the United States it could have barely very easily been the dis United States and that would have led to a lot an awful lot of bloodshed in fact the only time when America tried to split apart it led to the bloodiest war costing the most number of lives in American history so the founders knew what they were talking about when they talked about the necessity for uniting it also reminds us that as much as we like to complain about the divisions in the United States right now they're the the divisions that would be caused by some sort of secession like a violent secession would be a hell of a lot worse okay we'll be back here tomorrow lots more to discuss I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
