1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
my advice to her is to actually do less

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,059
but be fully recharged when she's doing

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,170
it Hillary Clinton can also demonstrate

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,560
and that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can run a campaign and be a</font>

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,380
leader and and not burn out in the

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,859
process men have designed both the world

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,960
of politics and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of work and</font>

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,519
it's not working<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sustainable</font>

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,570
and so if a woman and candidate and

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,969
maybe a woman president can demonstrate

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in fact self-care and is not the</font>

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,050
opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being a committed dedicated</font>

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,050
leader but makes you better at your job

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,090
it would be a breakthrough and that's

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,920
more important<font color="#E5E5E5"> than trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything it's something which goes</font>

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,030
against the grain in a political

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,820
campaign but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end campaigns and</font>

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,489
candidates are more adversely affected

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,190
by the mistakes they make rather than by

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:00:00,000
what they haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> or said</font>
