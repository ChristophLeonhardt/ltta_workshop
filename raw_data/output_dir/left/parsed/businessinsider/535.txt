if you look at the 30 and 40 year
pictures here apparently where some of
those homes were located was in the
middle of a lake so you know it may be
Mother Nature just taking back and this
lake trying to become a lake again we
don't know it's a little bit too early
for that it might be premature to say
the sinkhole is growing
