SHOULD STEP UP AND DISMISS THE
ENTIRE INVESTIGATION.
AND THE JUDGE ALSO HAS A RIGHT
TO DETERMINE.
THEY WENT BEYOND THAT.
EVEN IF ROSENSTEIN INTENDED TO
GIVE IT TO THEM.
HE HAS A RIGHT TO DETERMINE THAT
BY GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT THEY
HAVE FAINTLY TAINTED THIS CASE.
>> THAT WAS RUDY GIULIANI, PART
OF THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM
WEIGHING IN ON THE JUDGE
OVERSEEING PAUL MAN FOT'S CASE.
WHO RECENTLY LAID INTO MULLER'S
SPECIAL COUNT
SPECIAL COUNSEL, ACCUSING THEM
OF TARGETING THE PRESIDENT.
OUR NEXT GUEST AGREES ADDING
IT'S TIME FOR MUELLER TO WRAP UP
THE PROBE ONCE AND FOR ALL.
ROBERT CHARLES SERVED AS
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE
UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
YOU SAY IT'S TIME TO WRAP UP THE
PROBE.
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN AND WHAT
CAN BE DONE TO FORCE THAT HAND.
>> A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK
MR. GIULIANA IS RIGHT IN
EVERYTHING HE SAID.
I WOULD FOCUS THE ATTENTION
RIGHT NOW ON CONGRESS BECAUSE
THERE IS A REQUEST PRESENTLY
PENDING THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN HAS
NOT HONORED AND THAT IS A
REQUEST FOR THE FUEL SCOPE MEMO
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AND THE UNITED STATES
CONGRESS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS
INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY WAS
ALLOWED TO DO.
THE REMARKABLE PART HONESTLY IS
THAT THIS INQUIRY WHICH CONGRESS
HAS MADE HAS BEEN REBUTTED BY
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO
SAYS HE'S BEEN EXTORTED BY
CONGRESS.
AND THAT'S QUITE REMARKABLE IN
THE CONTEXT OF CONGRESSIONAL
OVERSIGHT POWER PS THERE ARE SIX
PROVISIONS IN THE CONSTITUTION,
18 STATUTES THAT VALIDATE THIS
REQUEST.
TO ME IT'S VERY SURPRISING MORE
THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHY THE
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHICH
INCIDENTALLY HE'S BLOCKING THE
PRODUCTION OF THIS DOCUMENT,
WHICH MAY BE LAW ENFORCEMENT
SENSITIVE BUT THEY'RE FULLY
ENTITLED TO GET IT UNDER THE LAW
OF THE LAND.
IT'S THE EXACT SAME DOCUMENT
THAT THE JUDGE IN VIRGINIA IS
TRYING TO GET.
TO WRAP THIS WHOLE THING UP, YOU
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS
WHOLE THING IS.
>> WELL EXACTLY.
>> AND THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO
GET AT IT.
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SCOPE
MEMO WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
PRODUCED BY ROD ROSENSTEIN WHICH
GIVES THE AUTHORITY FOR BOB
MUELLER, HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN AND
CANNOT INVESTIGATE.
AND AS JUDGE T.S. ELLIS IS
REVIEWING THE CASE IN FRONT OF
HIM, HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THE
CHARGES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST
PAUL MANAFORT ARE WITHIN THE
GUIDELINES AND RIGHT NOW HE
CAN'T SEE THAT UNREDACTED.
>> IN 12 DAYS WE'LL KNOW WHETHER
HE GETS THE MEMO.
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS
AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO THAT MEMO.
THEY HAVE SUBPOENA POWER,
IMPEACHMENT POWER OVER
HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS, POWER OF
CONTEMPT.
ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
FOR THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
GENERAL, A VERY SMART GUY, NOT
TO SIT BACK LOOK AT THIS --
FRANKLY START WITH THE OVERSIGHT
MANUAL.
EVERY AMERICAN CAN GOOGLE THE
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICES
OVERSIGHT MANUAL.
150 PAGES OF CASE LAW.
MAKES CRYSTAL CLOO
MAKES CRYSTAL CLEO
MAKES CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT
CONGRESS HAS THE RIGHT TO THE
DOCUMENT.
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ROD
ROSENSTEIN IS CONFLICTED?
HE'S THE ONE THAT HELPED
RECOMMEND THAT COMEY NO LONGER
BE THE FBI DIRECTOR.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING
HE'S JUST TOO INVOLVED TO BE A
FAIR ASH TORE
FAIR ARB TORE
FAIR ARBITORE
FAIR ARBITERE
FAIR ARBITER OF WHAT BOB MUELLER
CAN AND CANNOT DO?
>> HE'S IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.
HE'S A SMART GUY.
HE HAS A GAP IN HIS
UNDERSTANDING AND THAT MAY BE
OVERSIGHT.
HE'S RESPONDING ON MULTIPLE
FRONT TO CRITICISM.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT
LOOKS LIKE HE'S CONFLICTED.
AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO ASK
YOURSELF WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO INSTEAD OF WHAT'S THE
POLITICALLY RIGHT THING TO DO OR
WHAT WILL COVER MUELLER'S
INVESTIGATION FOR SOME
ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF TIME.
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, IS
THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO WRAP IT
UP.
>> IT'S INTERESTING AS THE
JUDGES POINT OUT, AS T.S. ELLIS
SAID, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
FIGHTING FOR PROSECUTION OR
