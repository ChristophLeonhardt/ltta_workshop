we're live three two one thanks everybody for joining us I'm Jeremy Boren god king of the daily wire that's lowercase G lowercase K and I'm here with my pals Michael Knowles Andrew Clavin and the one and only Ben Shapiro and the point of tonight is that we're hanging out we're watching the State of the Union we wanted to invite you guys back to kind of our lives a little bit the point of tonight won't really be talking about politics although whenever we're together we talk a lot about politics and we're gonna watch the speech so probably a political thing or two will come up but really it's just a chance for us to engage with you guys and say hey come hang out in our office and enjoy a nice cigar enjoy a little bit of whiskey all things in moderation my friends yeah why are we here Facebook are used to a live stream we want you to go up hit follow hit subscribe if you're on YouTube go ahead and ring the bell if you're on Facebook turn on your notifications you know social media is kind of hard on us conservatives out there and we could use all the help we can get getting our message to you we also have the lovely the talented Alicia Krauss she's with us she's gonna be taking questions from you all night in the comments on whatever platform you're watching the Alicia will be curating those and we'll kick it to her every now and then so that she can bring us your questions and we can bring you answers actually seems like a neutral reach we will respond those will start blankly into the camera so welcome to the daily wire state of the union coverage the greatest president that God ever created okay so first of all is anyone here gonna see Black Panther because I've heard that it is actually against the law to criticize this I haven't seen it but it's wonderful it's just like Wonder Woman right which is the greatest movie that has ever been made I think isn't when I watch it and then it was pretty good I sort of I still felt bad I felt like I was still incomplete between Gone with the Wind and Citizen Kane yeah I liked the women who cried when they saw it because finally a woman had won World War one so yeah I'm very excited about black day out there so that's that that's ranking high on my on my list of priorities I'm gonna say something blasphemous the trailer for ant-man is better than the trailer for black those who would say you know the thing about it though is they will find something to complain about like someone didn't win the right of Ward for Black Panther so I under not only who will get in trouble for saying something less than perfect about black panther but then how they will complain about black well they won't win any awards right so Wonder Woman didn't win any awards and that was the big thing they didn't get magic gold statuettes they're all very wealthy and throw very famous but they didn't get a little gold statuettes so I've been handicapping the Oscars you guys even handicapping this thing it trying to get drew to loan me his screeners is the only honest man in Hollywood we we add so drew belongs to the Writers Guild having accomplished books with words and they provide him with screeners for all with the nominated films to get his opinion on them and when you live in Hollywood you pretty much live especially when you're young and poor on a steady stream of borrowed screeners from your pals like I probably have a stack at various times in my life of hundreds of these screens I'm an never really watched him I can't confess to that but I have them drew the one man when asked about it this week said they find people hundreds of thousands of dollars you have to you have to understand each one of these starts with them notice the FBI I mean honest they are yeah what when my son was little he asked if he could he just borrowed without asking he borrowed one of my screeners and took it to his friend's house and left it there and I was like they do fight they do say they find you and they watermark them well I've been doing the PC handicapping because the this counter works right I mean so last year moonlight won because obviously gay black pebble age intersectional movie the year my god if somehow they could have been transgender they just would have actually forced you with your eyes open like a Clockwork Orange but this year it looks like to me get out and shape of water are gonna be the two frontrunners just from that so you and I have a significant disagreement get out I said on the show today I think it's a racist film you think that you think that it's not something I should care the distal racist film because it's a horror movie it's I don't see why a black guy can't use his racist paranoia to make a horror movie just like we all okay but then you'll admit but the Stepford Wives is like a really anti man film yeah right but a good mom right okay that's that's fine because we don't actually disagree and there is a moment in the book of The Stepford Wives one of my favorite it's actually one of my favorite moments and thrillers where they come out and they came one sentence where he tells you that their children are happier after they become step well maybe it's worth it then yeah okay so like monopolize this questions in the conversation but now I do want to turn to you know this guy's speaking for the the sight of him when they announced the President of the United States and all the Democrats sitting and then him clapping for himself spectacular I am looking forward to it but I think we have to do a couple of things one we have to do kind of grades for your one okay and then I think that we should also probably talk a little bit about all of the FBI scandal stuff the memo gate and all of the rest of us because I won't we pick one of these to start with you want to show you want start the grades for your one yeah I think because nobody go grades for year one just so we can at least my we've we've shared some laughs we've proven that we're friends and now well alright great crazy low hearse Knowles you get to go first no way you say something wrong by the way I like the Bruce Wayne get up oh so this whole thing well I figured well I don't know there's not a great is there a great above the the a is there a great above it is there some letter that I didn't know about I mean some action Aramaic or something that I I'm really pleased with it I obviously I'm a fan of my convert you know to to the Trump train the zeal of the newly converted they can burn heretics the whole deal the one the one mistake was the sessions recusal so that is why he doesn't get the oh that was the one missing all the other like the stormy Daniels or whatever nonsense they dredge up I don't care about any of that the sessions recusal was really his right back to me yeah is it smart yes okay and and have a try let's go those were do you think those any on your alright Charlottesville was inarticulate he could have quit while he was ahead at various points of that I think I think it was it was a little bit bungled it's not enough given all the good stuff we got and his end his performance after the Charlotte's whole response I'm not gonna ding him on it to the degree that I would ding the sessions recusal but that was a flub he could have you could have done better I'm willing okay see so a from you how about you hey - I get me Mom hey - yeah I definitely give him an A on the overall Trump year I think it was an amazing year for conservatives I think you know you you always you can't judge a president on what it doesn't do you have to judge him on what he accomplished and the judges and the deregulation which I'm a big fan of deregulation obviously and the tech tax reform the tax cuts the economy the dinging constant dinging of the press which I will talk I could talk about for an hour which I think has been great I think he has put the press on the defensive they now the the media now acts the way Republicans act around the media Republicans act around the media like abused children abused children are always afraid to say the next thing because they never know when daddy's gonna start whaling away at you and that's the way Republicans have behaved around the media for the last 30 years now the media acts that way they're even acting that way about the State of the Union before he's even there saying I don't care if he's presidential he's like don't say he's president you know they're really worried what happens when Trump meets the public directly the Trump of it all it is a weird problem for me the the the Trump II like rudeness the bullying the floods and the things that he says you know Charlottesville I was not as upset as you were cuz I thought he was actually Saints trying to say something different than he said but was tone-deaf I can't separate the things that he does that I find appalling you know with the accomplishments he's had because I actually believe the left is succeeded in wrapping our conversation in this straitjacket of a few so that Millennials won't say what I'll say because I grew up in a different time you know even time traveler at this point from another age you know I will say anything and Millennials won't save them because they already know that that's as as much as their reputations as much as their careers are worth and he's broken through that do I wish he had broken through it race and width and style you bet I do has he done that no but I'm not sure in this day and age that anything but the sledgehammer of Donald Trump which really does still appalled me and goes up my gentlemenly spine Overton Window okay in terms of conservative okay so what's nice about this room is that it's divided right along so did you explain to them we're not really in the same room in fact we're from this side of the mason-dixon line I would say yeah I mean to the extent that you're what you're describing is the two trumps on on policy I think Trump has given us a terrific year I think that we sometimes in conservative media have a tendency to overstate how good a year it's been and I think that we right now in the conservative media have a tendency to understate any past Republican accomplishments of the last 50 years and that bothers me but even with that being said it's still been a terrific year we've got some great judges great Deaver deregulation some great policies we got tax reform to whatever degree we got it meaning I don't think that the tax reform that we got is as great as the tax reform that we say that we got and I think we've gotten tax cuts in the past and we pretend that we haven't gotten them now because they would have a form like this we've gotten tax cuts in the past and this reform other than the corporate tax rate is basically it's I mean but it wasn't pitched that way so that's right so I agree with listen I really like the tax bill but what happened and what it delivered are actually two different things so when delivered was corporate tax cuts as pitched as an individual to once cut it's not talking in terms of individual tax cuts you have to talk about reagan lowering the top tax bracket from seventy percent to twenty eight what I'm buddies it but yeah I mean I obviously yeah I'll finish my grading here my problem where I really that I have two issues that divide me from the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from and that is that I don't think that you can talk about what the president does and what the president says because I think that the number one thing that the president does is say things that the jobs are the first one yeah the job of the president is as much the bully pulpit as it is any individual policy many of the things that we disliked about Barack Obama were rhetorical they were the way that he never even pretended to be the president of the people in this room he never pretended to be the president of Republicans who referred Republicans as his enemies as the enemy of his constituents all through his tenure I don't like that Donald Trump does that same thing where the left is concerned I don't like the continuing polarization of America not just along political lines but along partisan lines I think we can win political arguments I don't know that we will win in the long run partisan arguments I especially think that because of the age barrier that you're referring to the fact that people under 40 reject the president in ways the people over 40 do not I think that that that doesn't bode well for us in in terms of our partisan success over time under the president so well that said it's hard for me to give him an a even though on policy certainly I would give the president an a but I think that that the things that he says matter in the moment they can it's fun to celebrate them there he's he's funny he punches all the right people most of the time I think sometimes we ignore that he put me there are people think some friendly fire but on the on the whole it's fun to watch him be Trump he has put the bully in to bully polls but I worry that there's consequences not only do I find it distasteful but I worry that there's consequences and and that brings me to the thing that I'm have the most concern about in the era of Trump and that is not what Trump says or does but what Republicans and conservatives say and do and defensive Trump which is where I think that we have the most liability right now it it bothers me that we can't say that what he does is good when it's good but also say that what he does is bad when it's bad I think that because we have have become so reactionary and partisan in my opinion that we're losing credibility with anyone who doesn't already agree with us about the guy we no longer seem like honest purveyors of an ideological which we can discuss the nature of ideologies but we're no longer purveying an idea I worry that we're only supporting a man and I think that that doesn't work well for conservatism over time yeah it's not it's not traditional conservatism I do think there is a segment of his base that is so rock solid that it's it's impressive but it that worries me to the the fact that he is such a big personality you know it's when we talk about the character of the presidency and does it matter that the president has a lack of character I mean there's no other way to put it he is not somebody who'd want babysitting your children he's not somebody we probably consider personal friends done he's not that guy um and you know not to not to go ancient philosophy but even Aerys I'll recognize that it didn't even have to be a good person make good citizen but well but it is also true that there are consequences to the nation for having a bad man even if he is doing good things for you and I agree with everybody and everything that's been said about policy obviously I've said I said it too I've said it directly to top members of the administration than on policy particularly executive policy I'd give him an a - you want to go ahead after Gorsuch that's right when he does good things I cheer him as loudly or more loudly than than anybody else but when he does bad things I think it is incumbent on us to it to speak up and we don't there there's there's a tendency not to and that's why when Mitch McConnell says best year for conservatism in a long time or in 30 years I will say in terms of conservative policy I probably agree with that in terms of for conservatism there's two ways to judge the year and one has not come in yet right so wave one is we can judge it on the policy and way to is what is the effect of that year right what how are we actually gonna have how does this play out over time so let's say that he's made all the causes that I love and that you like and all the policies that we love what if he has made those toxic right what if what if like to take an example that is close to my heart obviously I actually I think that most Republican presidents would have done the stuff that he did except for one thing where I give him 100% credit which is the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem I think it takes a man who does not care about any of the norm to do something like that and he's totally right and good for him and full marks now what if his toxicity actually makes that an unpopular position a much more unpopular position than it was before and you've seen this in all of the areas where he's injected himself into culture so for example the NFL fight which I'm sure you guys celebrated and thought oh this is great so I will show you what I will tell you why I don't think it's great the reason that I don't think it's great is not because I think he's wrong I think he's a hundred percent right obviously the reason that I think that it's that it's bad is that if you look at the opinion polls and I we're not supposed to pay attention to polls anymore but I think they are reflective of something okay if you look at the opinion polls on how many reflect my fake news Ben cigar don't feel wise enough oh yeah now think you know the problem is that if you look at if you leave the polls on the on the patriotism question on whether you should actually stand for the anthem or not what you see is that before Trump intervened 75 percent of the American public thought you're an idiot if you'd kneel for the anthem after Trump intervened 55 percent of the American public thinks you're an idiot if you kneel for the anthem so he can win a personal victory because that's a popular issue obviously but if Hillary Clinton had its head said anything let's say God forbid Hillary were president and Hillary had said anything that lowered by 20% the number of Americans who thought it was bad to kneel for the anthem we would say that's a terrible effect look what she's done okay and this is this is the problem with him being personally toxic he can say things I like and now I actually have a stake in him not being personally toxic like if he weren't representing policies I don't care about I wouldn't have a stake in his character then it'd just be like okay he's a bad character he's doing crap I don't care about who cares but if he does stuff that I really like and I want to see victorious and I speak to young people all the time and I want to see young people fall in line behind a lot of the ideas that he's actually winning for then he needs to be good at promulgating those ideas not just getting them implemented the president has power because the president's the president but what happens in 2020 what happens in 2024 what happens when there's a poll that shows Republicans under the age of 30 75% of them want Trump primary in 2020 okay that's not good for conservatism but you've made a good point which is that you now have stake in his personal success his personally being likable there are there are issues where half that we're so partisan that were so divided that if Mitt Romney the most likable Republican there is if he intervened half the country would oppose even if that weren't necessarily the case now this is I that looks delicious you know the the question of conservatism I think is one that we should talk about because I do I do disagree a little bit let's talk about it okay but let's talk about it after we allow Ben to catch some air and we go to Elisha who's ready with a few the first set of questions only Jeff we have you hey guys how are you hi Alicia hey everyone I'm Alicia Krauss and to have your question hurts as Jeremy said earlier you can just ask away in the comments tree Monfils book youtube or daily wire comm will pull your questions and the guys will answer them live on the air so be sure to direct your question towards either michael andrew or jeremy and if you really have to you know it'll be lots of fun and don't forget anyone this isn't like the conversation where only subscribers can ask well we do love it if you all subscribe anyone can ask on facebook youtube or daily wire.com right and if you're watching on facebook or youtube again we're gonna hit this several times over the night because you probably have read the news about algorithm changes about adblocks about shadow bands about black lists we struggle to get our message to you we want to be able to do that you can help us if you're on youtube hit subscribe for us and while you're there go ahead and ring that bell that ensures you'll get notifications from us if you're on facebook be sure to follow us either on ben's personal facebook page daily wires facebook page and while you're there if you'll go into your settings and turn notifications on that keeps the algorithm from being able to block our stuff from getting it from getting to you and ensures that you'll be able to see whatever it is that we do for however long they and I do want to get you guys opinion on the unmet okay because now we're gonna get the the Battle of the memos and how this is all worked out so I'm gonna give my very brief take here because I think everybody is prejudging the evidence before it's in and it's making me absolutely insane so number one I think that it is pretty obvious that the FBI had been corrupted by Obama and by Hillary with regard to the Hillary investigation I think that it's pretty obvious that the James Comey and members of the FBI we're going to find her they were going to exonerate her but we knew that from literally the day that James Comey announced that he was not going to recommend any sort of prosecution of her because he actually changed the verbiage of the law well in order to let her off I mean I pointed this out the day that had happened because the lawyer I'm looking at the statute and going there's nothing in here that says you have to have intent right he was actually adding an element to the law to get her off so it's pretty obvious that something was going on there but the leap they're to the Trump Russia collusion investigation is itself fatally flawed by the way I don't think Trump colluded with Russia but the leap to the investigation itself is fatally flawed and corrupt I think is a pretty major leap even if you think that the FISA warrant was based for for Carter page the Trump foreign policy advisor was based on the Russian dossier Carter page had a FISA warrant against in late 2014 the guy is dirty and he's been dirty for a long time and so the idea that we're going to jump from memo gate that we're gonna jump from from Devon noon is his memo about intelligence community bias to shut down the Muller investigation that's a leap that I don't actually see and until we actually see the memo we're not gonna know on the other hand the Democrats saying that it's the worst thing ever to write this memo and we're all gonna die and it's traitor isn't it and yet no one can question the FBI and all that seems over-the-top to me as well but the pitch and tenor have gone so high before Bernie Sanders is in the chamber we we have we have Democrats entering the chamber right now getting ready for the President's speech whatever throw tomatoes at Trump when he walks in it would be the greatest television since our election night coverage with a man laughing it's all reality TV so can we actually do like the Japanese TV show slippery stairs and he can actually come down the slippery stairs I'm just hoping they did the Democrats illegal aliens and the Republicans bring in ice yeah you know if because they were saying they were gonna bring in these illegal aliens yeah if that is the case mustn't we arrest and deport them isn't anything less a mockery of our national immigration regime that room should actually just get a bunch of people to put walls around them yeah I want to answer yeah because first of all I I absolutely agree that there are two issues here one is the is the surface of it is the Hillary investigation but the depth of it is the degree to which Barack Obama with supine pressed turn the federal government into a chicago-style Democrat machine and in think about a Democrat machine is it doesn't always break the law it's not against the law to give jobs to friends and and to sort of you know ice the opposition a little bit but it is dishonorable and it's not really the way the federal government has run in the past and Barack Obama definitely turned the federal government into a Democrat style urban machine while the press sat by and asked him what enchanted him most about the president mean I agree but do you think it's a problem I mean I do think it is a problem if the Republicans take those problems and then blow them up to encompass them all our investigation itself because if they do that I think that they are they're actually moving into Democrat territory by taking the entire institution of the FBI when suggesting that it's so corrupt that we can't trust them about anything gaudy to his credit who is bought back Bob Muller all along said that the Republicans are expert at taking good facts and using so much hyper hyper Sinhalese Inc that the way that the Russian investigation has been I the Russians the Russians had no effect on the election a great they have they have been bothering us on our elections for at least 20 years that this this whole investigation and the mistake of appointing a special counsel to investigate it that's Trump's mishandling but but it is it is indeed the working out of what Hillary Clinton herself said would be horrendous if they did not accept the results of an election and that is what it is and I think that that's appalling it doesn't mean that Muller is not an honest guy it doesn't mean that he's not going to find you know come out with an honest I actually don't think there'll be an indictment coming down I think Muller will actually comment right I think Muller is not going to indict I think that Muller will the best that he's gonna do is talk about how Trump has a pattern of obstruction but having looked at the law the chance of actually being able to indict Trump on that we're actually the worst available scenario which is gonna be Democrats use whatever Muller comes up with as the grounds for impeachment and Republicans defend whatever Trump did in order to defend him against the infamous cheerful person but no because I think that's where this is going right we've gotten to the point where we will defend everything that Trump does and this is because I think you can do both things you can say Trump did a bunch of stupid things you shouldn't have done and also this is not impeachable exactly one of my favorite websites is the Babylon BS it's a satire site evangelicals and it's so they had a they had a story about major evangelical leaders talking about how Trump was only dating porn stars as a way of sort of converting the missionary dating yeah yeah this is great man yeah the the problem for me with the with the moment of we're in history is I wasn't sure at first if it was like we Bend our selves into such contortions to try to make what's wrong right and the shame of it is we're also getting a bunch of things that are good yeah but you know I do think the Trump Trump like all of us exists in time and one of the things that I noticed that America sure just be an eternal present I mean he's nothing but hamburgers but he's the healthiest person in America that's because he's never wasted his life force on exercise ureases Gwyneth Paltrow opinion somehow this is totally the only exercise he ever got was carrying the coffins of people who exercise or maybe here we go I think they're about to announce Trump's all three chambers so get ready for those mats to sit and not cheer I think they will not as no way to analyze no way their blood no where they it'd be a good look for them in the long run they cared for their base they figured Trump's at thirty you know forty percent approval rating they have a midterm coming up and the chances that they're actually notices he's forty percent no matter what they do which is what any impressive actually I guess they did Ryan's just reading stuff so I get a trumpet that looks like Trump accenting the White House they're still driving in more over how do I know what the White House next it looks like because I'm too into politics and my favorite people in the administering to me is that you know all the policy that's good that's been coming out yeah I give Trump full credit because he's at the top of the of the trade but the people who are actually making the policy underneath him are the people who are actually making the policy underneath him like well not always I mean the fact is that I think George W Bush was a little more involved in policy than then Trump is I think even Reagan was more involved in policy than Trump is every so often you'll see Trump speak about policy in an open setting and Kevin McCarthy has to then direct him no you're not actually spy no question when he delegate and when he delegates that when he delegates that's great and you gets he gets full credit for that but I think it's important for people who are his critics to recognize there are a lot of hard-working people who are around him so even if you don't like Trump the people around him who are trying to do the right thing for the contrary actually trying to do the right thing for the country and their bunch of those people and it's important for people on our side to realize that the same thing which is a lot of the great things that you're getting out of Trump are the result of even critics of Trump you know the the yes a lot of our pals who were very vocal in their in their opposition to never Trump which at this point I think we should just all admit that never Trump isn't the thing it was a major stream on the right hates this guy yeah yeah in spite of all of the excellent major I don't think that's correct look at the list of people who were quote-unquote never Trump who didn't vote firms I didn't vote from in the general election right trying to go up I didn't vote from an Journal day McChrystal but but the vast majority of those people have been giving real credit where credit is due and defending him from from stuff when he doesn't deserve it right they'll hit him but it's but there there is a group and I think it's relatively small right I think you can name them actually where I think it's like Brett Stephen Bret Stephens Bill Kristol he's a firm that the people name them they're quite prominent people who were were former leaders of the case but it but the but to suggest that there was this broader never Trump movement that has continued past the election is not true it's literally like three guards but could never Trump existed in time right because never Trump for me for most people who are never Trump yeah okay never Trump was I'm not voting for him once he's president that no longer applies I don't have a vote for him anymore it's over can I finish the thought though about he's just this thing but like all of us he lives in he moves in time he was a political neophyte he does learn stuff you can watch him figure stuff out he is not the man he was when he took office he's a much smarter much better politician than he was you know and he's heard a lot of them escaped a lot of the mistakes he made of staffing the guys he fired that it was all at the beginning and he started to figure stuff out and then people that you're giving credit rating about a colonel yeah it's a day he's not greedy Amana curve he is a neophyte he is unlike other the one thing there's a lot I'm crying a guy who stepped in out of a different business and he has learned okay so so I so I agreed that he has learned which levers to pull okay that that but that is not the same thing as saying that he learns on the job right as far as what the job comes is here's the thing you keep going back to and this is two different visions of the presidency and this is where I think the fundamental disconnected you keep going back to he's learning on the job if you think that the job is purely you sign your name on this piece of paper and X happens or you fire this guy or hire this guy and Y happens and then I agree with you if you think that learning on the job actually involves growing into the office like there are a lot of us who thought maybe there's a report denied the election you know and when I was laughing hysterically because this whole thing is incredibly absurd and so funny but it's but there was a report that that Trump got the news that he'd won but for a second there was like a sobering moment where he realized he was president growing into the job when we first talked about it was not just he's gonna learn which piece of paper to sign or he's gonna learn which guy to staff at state or to listen to Mike Pence to whom in his staff at state right growing as the job was going to mean that he recognized I'm now sitting in the office those are occupied by Abraham Lincoln right I'm now sitting in the office that was occupied by Ronald Reagan and Grenn Calvin Coolidge and great men who sat in this office and helped bring the country together and there he hasn't learned a damn thing I mean look at his Twitter feed the idea that heat the idea that he is bringing the country together again I like his policies and I can like his policy but let's face reality here the country is as divided or more divided than it was the night of the election what you're saying is that his character hasn't changed yeah somebody somebody at during my which is there which is the fact that always bothered me which is right I mean it wasn't even his policy in my version of the conversation somebody asked me why you and I saw this differently and I gave an answer as we do on the fly but after I went home and thought about it I realized that I'm a novelist my job is to observe stuff and to look at stuff and I've always and we've we've taught you and I have talked about this a lot is that I've always had a very tragic view of the world and I've always thought like nations combinations go there's no question there's no question that our culture is at a low our culture has really gone downhill and Trump is non Trump is not only create helped create that bar as a product but he is a product of that nature I wish you were Lincoln to you know I am sad that our culture is a Lincoln I tell her the like I said I'm sad that our culture has become a fight between jay-z and Donald Trump that that makes me sad but it is where we are and in some ways like it is is a positive given even that fact it is a positive occurrence that a conservative voice has come out and bought the culture it is a cultural figure it was a hopeful bet if you fight the fight in the wrong way you end up alienating a lot of the people to be a prospective allies this is about your your your grading him against your grading him against the alternative of Hillary being president or grading him against the alternative of Jeb Bush being president and I'm grading him against the alternative of this is the greatest opportunity unexpected opportunity didn't no one expected right I mean even no one there expect like I I know people in the Trump administration no one thought he was going to win okay all of this revisionist history where they were sitting around and they had all the maps in front of them and they're playing the forty doesn't believe it's just not true but they're not really I mean I think that I don't know that he wanted to win or he didn't want to win I think that the whole thing was started off as a lark and suddenly he finds himself in the Oval Office oh you want and I think wants win cuz he likes winning I'm not sure that he wanted when he want to be president but I think that but that being the case like if he could let's put this way if he could put the win on his on his box and then go golfing for four years so long as all his policies get done but I think that we have to grade him against maybe it's early maybe it's early maybe you're right maybe it's a little early for us to grade him against the opportunity lost until we know what opportunity has been lost but I fear that an opportunity is being lost in real time and every time we have one of these moments right in the State of the Union tonight where he's going to come together he says he's gonna try and unify the country yeah so he's gonna come together he's gonna say a bunch of stuff up the teleprompter I hate this whole thing this monarchist crap and that's really what it is if any of the terrible it's such garbage idea what are we talking about the in the State of the Union say the Union itself is monarchist garbage this idea of the great the great king walking in in the legislative branch applauds and go back to sending a letter to Congress later George Washington did I'd be much I tweeted out the state of you I'm fine with everybody disagree with you about this but but sorry to finish the time so when every time he does one of these they're a set of headlines the next day saying this is the day that Donald Trump became president we've had at least five rooms we had this after he had Congress last year yeah right which was a very good speech yeah right we had it after his inauguration we had it like this was the moment that Donald Trump became president and then within 24 hours he's back to being Trump yeah and if the imagine if that moment actually happened imagine if he gave the speech tonight and then he didn't go on Twitter and start a bunch of fights of jay-z right yeah and this is and then no I but I think that you're joking but I don't think I'm not grand I think and I think that and I think that what you are saying is the problem because I think so long as his base continues to cheer him when he does stupid crap he's gonna continue to stupid crap and we're gonna cheer him because we're the base but there's a whole world of people outside of us who don't share this stuff we think that this who think that this disgrace is the office of the presidency and I'm willing to take the good along with the bad so long as there's good but there could come a point pretty quickly here I mean again not cite polls but right now he's losing him pose to Bernie Sanders in 2020 57 240 okay that's that that's not great no I'm skeptical of okay I'm skeptical with some of these polls too because it's not an actual election cycle he lost the popular vote by three million he's gonna need to win ten million additional votes from from 2016 to 2020 if he wants win reelection Bush had to Bush lost by 500,000 votes he had to win twelve million additional votes to just beat John Kerry by a little bit right right that means that Trump is gonna have to do better there's just no question he's gonna have to do better unless the Democrats make the mistake of nominating again they somehow find the second worst candidate in history Grammy's are they out of their mind they must be crazy she's out of her mind and she is hitting the sauce so you remember after Al Gore lost the presidency after he won the presidency after he lost the presidency yeah you remember the beard like if Hillary could grow a beard if she's hitting the sauce saying if she's hitting the sauce oh I don't like having pity for Hillary but a you know so I feel a familial bond to her but breaking news the White House is announcing that they're going to have Trump yeah like this he's gonna reverse Obama's executive order to close the detention center in the State of the Union so he's gonna reopen and get moe can we get our cigars through Gitmo or do we have to go to Havana listen before the action starts I'm sure people want to know about the cigars because yeah actually wearing a smoking jacket and yeah we are in fact all cigar smokers at the Daily wire except for young mr. Shapiro who has no vices at all but Michael and I made a trip down to slave island last year in search of the finest cigar I don't mean we went down there they buy Cuban cigars you'll hear people who say oh we love Cuban cigars no no we were looking for like the cigar yeah we're here's a checkered weekend just to buy cigars we flew down on a Friday we flew back on a Sunday yeah we all we did virtually all we did on this whole island was go shop to shop to find the rarest cigars you can find and Michael Knowles I'm smoking my favorite cigar Monte Cristo on you ha though this is a an aged delicious cigar I think we had also a Churchill's house I think drew is is smoking the Romeo wide Churchill which is a wonderful cigar but the cigar of the night belongs to Michael Knowles and it's because it is the Donald Trump of cigars this is the Donald Trump of cigarettes very pleased that we got this this is the bek of 56 this is the taut the top of the line of the top of the line of Cohiba which is the premier brand classy hundred 20 bucks but still no 150 well there is something about this cigar it is oversized like some say our president is known for its yellow and shiny top and exclusively it's a KFC which is very good for our country and the cigar you think about listening to Noel's talk about cigars because it'll make the State of Union sound really interesting yeah we've that humidor is almost exclusively stacked with with our Cubans basically yeah that's the bounty from Cuba we're this is the executive offices here at the at daly wire headquarters so we keep all of our cigars on proud display we mean this is Jeremy's personal you know it's funny because I shoot my show from the broom closet of the Ben Shapiro for an evening as a man who lives in Los Angeles I just want to ask you guys two questions one is it true that they roll the cigars on the thighs of virgins and - what's a virgin so we're just waiting at this point for for the president answered the speech is supposed to begin in about five minutes that means that he's gonna come in and then it'll be I really am fascinated to see who charges down for the photo with him like all the people in battleground districts usually this is the way that it works they said everybody in a battleground district next to the aisles they can get pictures with the president as he walks in then they can send that to all their constituents the chances that any Democrat does that are below zero right right I mean much better chance that one of them has a like a coconut cream pie so we should do some prop bets here I mean like what are the odds that some of these shouts you lie or just in the middle of the speech I guess the people that they've brought in first of all some of the Congressional Black Caucus are boycotting the speech I think they're spending they don't want to be with a bigot you know but yes I was I mean the question is how far after the speech is Bernie Sanders giving his because it takes him at least a year to toddle out of this do you think here's a question I want to ask when when Trump arrived in Davos and then that usually surprised by anything that I was really surprised startled by the absolute awe with which he was greeted by these people who were supposed to have lost all respect for America everybody stopped cold and I can't help but wonder if there's something about Trump yes to our quality about Trump that overrides a lot of their all this because all these Richie riches and tapos are now thinking maybe I could be President I mean they treated him more like a reality TV star than they did like the president yeah like in like if in order with Bush would calm they would just be like oh that's the president I have to negotiate that Trump is such a I mean he no one in the history of mankind Ezra C has been the center of attention like Donald Trump no no no question he's larger than life and the cameras have made him even larger than that and so all these guys were greatest case against Trump Russia collusion is the only thing Trump would possibly collude with is the management at Burger King actively figuring out a campaign plan to funnel information from the kraang to him like he's got a secret closet at headquarters and he's talking Putin it's just it's the most absurd theory of all time ridiculous but it's but okay so now we're getting nowhere with you know the white pantsuit you know there's worry leashes in the other room gushing over there excellent I really wish nobody maybe stormy Daniels reference guys don't do it I'm glad I finally don't do it I'm glad they show they're trying to make a big deal out of that stormy Daniels thing it did have me worried that she was gonna run away or something yeah if we lose Melania we know the chances of her running away from this marriage are you kidding me up I mean she points it you know they always I think okay I'm not gonna talk about the job that first lady's do which is to literally stand there and not terrible that's literally they're exactly exactly president that's right by day but yeah my favorite thing about Melania is that interview where they asked her if if Trump would be with her if she weren't beautiful and she said would I be with him if you were rich yeah it's just we don't know if that actually should for sure said oh here we go okay I want Steve minuchin to bring out his wife and those of you holding dollars as they walk it's so spectacular Rex Tillerson who doesn't know where he is there's Steve minuchin there's general manager taking a break from eating from flossing his teeth of Barbarossa certain cynicism in this room there's Attorney General Jeff Sessions who's been let out of his cage for the evening by the president yeah Steve a nutrient fresh from producing the latest smash hit Justice League I like that I do want to take this moment to say if you are not a subscriber to the daily wire

in the middle of it and the melon is like paintings in the center and be like pre Civil War there's mattes who single-handedly killed every ice exact exactly I wonder when he has the greatest lions in America does does he not write them or do they just meditate I mean said that they're there a few of them where they kind of spontaneously but they're that I would he's got to write them right I mean there's no way read like 7000 books every July is one of those great soldiers that's right right when you average the number of books that he and Trump have read together it's three I had the privilege of hosting our president not long after the presidency and he came out to LA spoke a very gracious spoke to a group that I that I ran at the time and he actually said during his speech I'm the only guy in America who's written more books than I've read what is it seriously carry us was the one besides the one they even know I didn't and now Paul Ryan looking awkward is he and the last person America likes Paul Ryan with a like alfalfa and a little rascal I like Paul Ryan I think he's in the wrong job and I feel sorry for him yeah I agree he was in his dream job and he was in the job that I dream of him having Eve and our party went into disarray and then there's Ben Carson a man who the president was suggested was an insane person who stabbed suggests he's a child abuser true words of money yes I mean let's just be real about this okay we're sitting here and it's 2018 and the second Donald Trump is gonna walk out the guy from The Apprentice gonna walk out and address us release the person like macho Camacho walking out there with two machine guns in either hand it's gonna be spectacular I do love American politics in the sense that I'm culturally oh that's it right there here we go they're gonna how can we hear this set can we get some done announce my Skeletor okay we need a wide shot guys like this is not useful this close up yeah really I don't know the Democrats are doing I don't know I don't care like I know Trump looks like muted applause I think they'll all clap for him walking in he's the president I think I think there are some I like james Clyburn and some of the people who are actually from the cbc will not stand up for him but they should give us a wide shot you're right hey this is this is bad camera work right here come on pull back guys pull back okay see the other see their budget there's some Democrats over there sitting down or standing awkwardly but not clapping yeah but your that that's they in-betweener appearing from the people who meet trumpet he's very likable in person you know so that maybe some of these people may actually like him any never they from the ones who have not been reduced to this morning Jim Acosta did not give me that more than a school right honorable Louie let me go there no there's Kevin McCarthy just trying to guard Trump from being whispered to by Chuck Schumer yeah a lot of Democrats sitting down not happy Durbin it really is low not to stand for the pretty it's a bad look you know honestly I hate the State of the Union address so much that any drama that's added I'm in favor of it I hate this thing so much hi sir I don't fault people for staying home I love that Scalia never used to go to this charade the reason I like the State of the Union though is some people watch it and it is the one time you forget we forget because we're in it a lot of people don't know what's going on have no idea what's going on Donald Trump doesn't know of course not waiter but he doesn't have to know what if it what if he actually does just read the memo I do love these buddies from a soliton so he gives himself the clap oh I didn't mean it the way it came out we're gonna talk a little less and let everyone at home actually hear some of the president's address I can't promise that we won't mouth you can't you really know and see like how like all these Democrats sitting right here oh yeah you stand for the president right I do look at aisle of this I love that he's like walking around clapping from something to campaign rally it's fantastic this way you know this is wait got a love bathroom yeah the guy the guy has no sense of place or time no as you say yeah and it's there's something charming about it there is it there it's like a guy olace like it weird innocence Pelosi not clapping but standing what if he actually just starts ripping on Andy McCabe's wife in the middle of the street I'll point some president-for-life if he brings out C been in a gimp mask I will say that on the day that uh well no we won't say this no ways get that we're gonna have a staff pop up a little popcorn for us yeah a little food in here food in here we'll watch the speech and hope you enjoy the speech to be sure and I hit subscribe if you're watching on YouTube follow us if you're watching on Facebook send us a comment or a question we'll be glad to answer here's the president well that was President of the United States Donald Trump and the first State of the Union address we are the daily wire I'm Jeremy boring here with Michael Knowles Andrew Clavin ben shapiro if you're watching us on facebook we thank you if you're watching us on youtube liar no one's watching us on youtube because they actually blocked us in the middle of the broadcast for using the same stream that the young turks are also using on youtube without being blocked what do you do about that well follow us over at facebook or visit the daily wire com become a subscriber not only do you get the delightful leftist here's how to roll tumblr for $9.99 but you can actually hear what we're saying now that I think about it makes almost no sense that I'm pitching this that you're not already on one of those platforms you aren't listening this is why you guys are actually the broadcasters and I'm the the god king is not all-knowing wouldn't predict for instance that YouTube would take us down for using a publicly owned stream right that the Young Turks is also using without any consequence people on Facebook to go over to YouTube and and hit the bell right yeah people should go over to that YouTube and hit the bell so if they can be notified when we don't have a feed yeah we're gonna take a few questions from the audience because we we got a good hour of talking in and then the president got one hour plus four and a half hours we want to hear from you head on over to Facebook ask you a question we'll kick over to Alicia Krause in five minutes and see if we've got some answers but first I was want to go quickly around the room what do we think of the speech give us a quick grade one or two lines of commentary would you think Ben um I mean b-plus the only reason it's not nays because just so long otherwise I thought that it was quite good I thought that whoever wrote his speech did or did a really good job I thought that he delivered it well I mean we know he can do this he did this last year I thought he gave a very good speech last year there the big story of the night of course is the Democrats Mike Pence secretly sneaked around to all the Democrats eat put super glue on the actual seat because they would not get up for anything the national anthem for war who for for war stories for like for anything for chance of USA they would not get up because they've determined that they are the anti-trump party they have no actual principles or anything they stand for they just don't like Trump so even when Trump is making overt calls for infrastructure plans Republicans generally hate Democrats still won't get up and cheer for that because like Hillary Clinton they think they're going to run a hundred percent anti Trump obviously the big moments of the night comes near the end we'll see how many people actually sock with the North Korean refugee who holds up his crutches near the end which is a dramatic flourish for sure and the in again I think that he did a very good job of using you of doing a tick that I think that Obama did early on well and later lost which was use unitl unity lines and forced the other side to take the non unity side so he'd say things like protect Americans from crime and Democrats would sit right when you say unifying things and the Democrats still won't do anything that's the art of politics that it was really well done tonight and this this round of good headlines I expect to last let's see it's 7:30 7:35 a.m. Pacific time tomorrow morning at which point President Trump between something and we'll be back into the news cycle yeah everybody you know I basically agree with that I would give him an A+ for the first 30 minutes after that I don't think anybody was listening yeah you know but but I thought you have to give him credit for the strategy of the speech the speech was put together which maybe Stephen Miller whoever wrote the speech the speech was designed to call out the Democrats on on major things not just what Ben said but also their unwillingness to compromise on the immigration policy because he was offering them stuff that his base hates he was offering them basically citizenship from millions of illegal immigrants in in return for security at the border and there clearly were not going to go for it I also thought the final moments of the speech were sensational if anybody was still around when you think back to Obama the notion that the people of this country are the source of it's not just as strength but also of its legitimacy that that that had been lost for eight years with Obama he he really always looked down upon the people of this country he said himself like I would like to just get the experts in a room and solve all your problems Trump looks to us to solve the problems that is the American Way I don't know if anybody was listening to that poor ation at the end but it was it was absolutely that was excellent and I just thought the strategy of the speech was great it did go along and I just twenty minutes I think people it you can't you can't do that you can't do that I mean Trump should know that better than anybody considering he's a hundred and forty character guy yeah like if he'd coming out to a tea that's true to a tea now if he'd come out and give him a twenty minute speech he would never stop being elected yeah Michael what do you think I am very pleased with Trump's performance over time now you know I will say I'm very pleased with his performance I'm very pleased with the writing I'm much more pleased with the Democrats performance they sat down for jobs they sat down not only for low unemployment they sat down for blue black unemployment yeah they sat down for welders I mean the national anthem they sat down for the new more unemployment look I could have looked for the flag they sat down because they had to and what I really think we all should give Trump or whoever wrote the speech or whatever credit because he left them no choice yet to sit for every one of those and it is it was beautiful I agree and he he did such a spectacular job and and they did such a what a drone death performance from people who are usually pretty good at showbiz right the Democrats have us beat there until we elected Donald Trump that they think that they can sit for things they even sat for things that are typically their issues they sat for infrastructure they sat for paid maternity leave they you know they said as you said they sat for basically amnesty those who don't hope we destroy he first makes mad well now we want to hear what you have to say about the speech we're gonna kick it over to our very own designated survivor as you know during the State of the Union the president picks one member of his cabinet to sit outside of the blast radius of your average nuclear warhead we do the same Alicia Kraus in The Daily wire bunker how's it going over there pretty good all safe over here Oh Jared and I are fine we're taking questions from the audience on Facebook because as you said we're shut down on YouTube but more about that later and we have some lots of fun responses and questions from people people really don't want to hear you guys talk about the State of the Union they want to know if Michael Knowles is wearing a clip-on tie I'm not gonna undo this tie yet because it's I will say they don't make novelty ties in like pure silk so it's it's pretty starchy but this was done all by my own honor I have never known Michael Knowles to wear a little more serious question for Ben he wants to know what kind of scotch are you drinking actually it's a multi question question what kind of scotch you drinking do you enjoy it is it neater on the rocks and is it kosher or the broadcast I said we have to get kosher whiskey because otherwise some of the last better so yes this is kosher whiskey and beforehand it is Jameson's and I had Jeremy tell me how to drink it eighteen-year-old sherry cask finished Jameson how much do I like it well let's just say that it was this alright next question is for Andrew Andrew Sarah wants to know if you were president Clavin so if this had been your State of the Union tonight and the three men in that room plus moi in the bunker were in your cabinet who would be in which position wait the three men here yes I would just be asking them questions I would just tell me what to do I have no idea what I'm doing that's it all right let's see I would put Ben in any position where he could kill people emotionally and that and of course I would put Noel's in the press he would be the press secretary yeah Jeremy would be the god-king because and me they did it they did include me I was there any time you okay yes I would definitely put Secretary of Commerce second but that's okay it's because I was home-schooled homeschooled that's my first thing would be to close it just like we're closed all of the ones that Rick Perry wanted to close and half the ones that he didn't remember Camilla has a question for our God King of course both of those are with lowercase because we're not blasphemous around here she says dear God King are you concerned about the negative health effects from all that secondhand smoke on the set I fear second hand cigarette smoke which is now killed officially more people than heterosexual AIDS as I said at the beginning of the broadcast all things in moderation one nice thing about delicious Cuban cigars is that you don't inhale the smoke one bad thing about smoking in my office is you do inhale all of the second and all of the second-hand again all of the cost in note of the benefit yeah I worry most for been the rest of us probably deserve what we like most of the harm goes to the wallet rather than to the law Margo has a question for everybody and she wants to know do Ben Andrew and Michael do everybody watch each other shows yeah yeah we're lying I thought we were lying I'm sorry and watches every second of my show to find the moment to fire me Jeremy is the guy king of the daily wired each morning I bring an offering to his office actually okay so speaking of Noel's who we all want fired sure wants to know is it true that if he stands in front of the mirror and repeats reasons to vote for Democrats the five times that Michael Knowles will appear it is true you know John put Horwitz tweeted at us actually I don't know if you saw this on Twitter he said what is up with the Davenport that has fake books in it I guess there I didn't look at the books over there but I will say this fake books have been very good to me I'm gonna put a lot of my betting and our final question for now because we'll be doing another round of these later Emmanuel wants to know guys what's up with the vegetable platter it looks totally untouched that's how you know we're men over to me I love anything with Alicia thank you no see in a bit yeah so we're standing by for one of seventeen and a half Democrat rebuttals to the speech and I think that it's fair do we do we know Willie wants we're gonna party of Joe Kennedy's we may have a preview of Joe Kennedy's did we did we pull the preview for Joe Kennedy speech okay well if we do yeah and we'll bring that up shortly City the third gluten solution so Joe Kennedy the third yeah here we have a preview of that actual rebuttal so here it is those can be the difference between guilt and innocence one of the things I love about America is that anyone can be President if your last name is Kennedy Clinton Obama is one of those things that you're a great girl what I love is they the Democrats are like we need a fresh face get anyone a fresh face you know something we've never Joe Kennedy the third you know Ben there's there's a curse for the State of the Union response and no one's ever given a good one yeah their party and who better to break a curse we know he's good at politics cuz the last names Kennedy yeah boy he looks a awful yeah I remember that you remember the Kennedy Nixon debate he learned all the wrong lessons no man was a Nixon should we listen to Merrick Laimbeer carry on that rich legacy speaking in a warehouse in front of the cops KGB's all the messages that we're losing what many American hunt pounds River has faced its share of storms but the people is Iran market tough they fight for each other they pull for their city it is a fitting place to gather as our nation reflects on the state of our union okay he's staying so we can we don't even know that was terrible we can we can fight the Jews actually got that she's really bad at this anxious I really feel like the vast majority of people are tuning in to hear us not talk about the state of these alrighty hey guys killing yeah man I do love it I love the Democrats intersectionality routine you know it's the year of the women it's the earth black people it's your hispanic joe cream on the way bring in the race why do you bring it has ever lived and what is with the drool on the side of his mouth I know what the Ross I mean I mean Rubio got like killed for drinking water this guy's drooling in fear don't have jest come make him look pretty like we also I mean Marco Rubio got killed for drinking water if a Kennedy drank water would be the first time he's just gonna keep on going here and we'll just make fun of him but what a thankless job any State of the Union that's true horrible job to do the rebuttal I feel like the Republicans should never do a rebuttal just yield the time back for the gentleman from wherever wherever but especially tonight when the Democrats basically abstained from the speech yeah they couldn't even support their own ideas when uttered by the president what's a guy like the problem with the Democrats now is that the way they sat down for jobs for America for the flag that actually represents a a large swath of the Democrat Party it's not an accident it is not an accident they don't stand for the flag they don't stand you know people have been tweeting oh blacks at you don't have jobs so what Donald Trump said something and you know about Charlottesville you know they actually don't stand for the real things that make people's life they stand for the state of the government and the state of a kind of a show business version of government well they have hinted themselves in a corner with all the intersectionality naans yeah so by having all of these folks like Colin Kaepernick Neil and then saying well we stand with the people who neil because this country is garbage you know or it has been garbage historically yeah it puts them in a position where next time somebody says we stand for the flag they now have to not stand for the flag so they they had to Trump for something who's smart he tried he forced them in to pick sides with Kaepernick as opposed to playing the middle position which is Kaepernick has the right to do what he's doing but I disagree with it right and he says we stand with the flag what they really should have done is stood up and then later they should have said listen we all stand for the flag but if somebody wants to not stand for the flag drop but they couldn't do that because they'd be alienating their own base this is what I was saying about I think that the Democratic Party is fallen into the trap now of just being hydron now that could work in elections ready worked for Republicans in 2010 Republicans basically ran anti Obama and they swept so it's quite possible that in 2018 Democrats just run anti Trump because the truth is as much as we talk about the State of the Union okay let's put it this way the bleep hole comments controversy happened a grand total of 17 days ago okay that's how fast the news cycle is right now the government shutdown ended a week ago yeah a week ago okay we don't remember any of that so the state of the idea the state of the union is gonna carry forward for nine months I worry about this I worry about this because I'm watching in Britain I was in happened to be in Britain when Jeremy Corbyn was elected the head of the Labour Party and this guy is a left-wing jew-hating piece of garbage he's a terrible terrible person and they basically the headlines were the Labour Party has destroyed itself and I said at the time no they haven't because every election is a binary choice and eventually this guy's going to come up against an unpopular Conservative government and Jeremy Corbyn could be Prime Minister and that is now what they're facing and so guys like Bernie Sanders who basically promote the Soviet yes point of ignition they could actually they could actually win election this is what's the area this is this is why Trump's popularity rating actually does matter it does matter you're right no you're right and I think the only thing I would say about Trump is that he has laid a bet that we haven't quite seen on changing the game he's actually trying to change the whole tenor in which we discuss these topics and I'm not sure that the polls reflect whether or not he's won I'm not saying he's won but I'm not sure they reflect whether I think that it's reflected that I'm not sure that he's won the bet but again you're right that it's a binary race so he's I think his bet is the Democrats are gonna be so dumb yeah but they nominate somebody terrible in 2020 which is a significant possibility problem and it's very possible if they nominate somebody like Joe Biden though it's gonna be rough if they nominate even somebody like Bernie said Bunny's been through the wringer already remember you can hit Bernie with a lot of stuff but Bernie was hit with a lot of stuff by Hillary Clinton with the Democrat base yeah so you know I think that Trump would go right at Bernie but I'm not sure Bernie doesn't go right at Trump so it's I just think that we I remember after 2004 after Bush won reelection I wrote a column where I thought Republicans know I'm gonna lose again I mean we've won three straight elections one 2001 2002 he won reelection 2004 even though he lost the popular vote in 2000 I figured we're on a roll this is this could be an era of dominance for Republicans and I got the same feeling among a lot of Republicans now who just they wanted to be true it's like we're never gonna lose again well the Democrats until five minutes ago thought the same thing that they were never gonna lose again and it's just not the way that that's absolutely but it does get to my central theory of the left which is that they they want the appearance of the thing but not the essence of the thing they want to look they want a president who looks like a president Barack Obama he talked like a good president the Kennedys they look like good but they aren't the husk of the thing and and what's unfortunate a little bit for us sometimes is Donald Trump doesn't look like the president yeah he doesn't talk like the president he doesn't behave like the president but he is governing like the president and that that's a real dichotomy I've never seen it so clearly in American politics and I don't know which way we're gonna go it's a superficial cultures the fact I think the way we're gonna go is the way we don't want to go because we're getting precisely the reverse of what you would think meaning that Trump is a visual president right he was the guy who was a reality TV star he had no experience in politics he wasn't the guy he wasn't Paul Ryan he wasn't a substance guy Trump is proof positive that Americans want the image of something well that's the image of the president or that's the image of just imagery they want the image and so the question is less image over substance then which image to Americans want and in that moment in 2016 what they really I still believe that the 2016 election we give Trump all sorts of props and he deserves props for visiting states that people like me thought he was a fool to spend time in Wisconsin and in Michigan I mean it relation Pennsylvania but but that election to me was still about the awfulness of Hillary Clinton much more than it was about the quality of Donald Trump as a candidate because Hillary Clinton did not pull in flies she could not get flies I mean it was and is if there's a reason did you see the during the State of the Union should released a huge Facebook statement literally during the State of the Union released a huge Facebook statement about how it was wrong of her to have not fired that guy for sexually harassing the help oh really yeah she released an ultimate you know you can't you can't I agree with you that image means so much as in this age of media and as it has since Nixon Kennedy but you reality does get a vote you can't like exclude the fact that the economy is better that people do have jobs and people when they have jobs you know it's not like you can you can have the you can have any we are telling you that oh the Obama economy was great but people knew it wasn't and wages are going up and bonuses are going up and jobs are going up and I think that's gonna I don't want to be the the pessimist in the room but that is my was born this way in the words of a famous thank you but here's the thing about the way the economy affects elections in my opinion I a bad economy will kill a president a good economy doesn't necessarily save one right so in 1992 the economy was already recovering by the time HW ran for reelection and he lost in 2012 the economy was recovering but wasn't that great and Obama won in 1980 the economy sucked so Carter lost but a good economy is not a guarantee that you actually win reelection so look does it help yes but the economy's also a precarious thing and I can't shake the feeling maybe it's just a feeling because I'm not looking at the underlying fundamentals when I say this every eight to ten years in the country there's some sort of recession right heaven 2000 it happened in 2008 which means were kind of overdue right which means it's 2018 so maybe this last another four years or maybe we go another two years and an economic crisis it's a direction we don't know so if we're betting on just that then I didn't mean to limited Mississippi I meant reality in general I mean one of the things that trump does that for me is an incredible relief after eight years of Obama lecturing us and telling us that's not who we are as if we are somehow better than other people we're not our ideas are better than other people but we are just people to have Trump basically law of this country law of the people of America law of our history law of our tradition I think that this is an important thing and I I did have this experience when I was in New York over Christmas of people looking me the eye and aggressively in New York wishing me Merry Christmas Merry Christmas looking right wing pet in right-wing circles this stuff has become sort of an in-joke and a password but I think that what you are right about more than Merry Christmas stuff is the idea that in Trump said it and he was right that the president is given all sorts of credit when the economy is good and given all sorts of the blame on the economy's bad it's really nonsense the truth is that the president usually has very little to do with the economic status of the country it's usually a delayed effect for three or four years I mean the idea that you're gonna attribute like Clinton's growth to not Reagan and Bush now just a Clinton is just silly yeah but that's not a rip on Trump what it is saying is when Trump said that America needs a cheerleader one of the things that the president can do that's effective is he can make business people feel comfortable and this is one thing Trump has done really well what the business community wants even more than the tax cuts because the economy is growing before the tax cuts one of the things the business community feels like is at least we know he's not gonna clock us across the face like some direction we don't know but with Obama any minute you felt like he could take the regular time State meeting with a brand of people feel this - the people are tired of having us apologized for what is after all the engine of democracy what is still this country is still the only reason any human being who's Korean section worked so well tonight yeah yeah I want to challenge I typically agree with Ben on these questions but while I agree that historically economic trends take a long time we have seen something in this presidency which is an immediate response immediately upon his election the stock market began to surge immediately upon the passage of taxes yeah consumer confidence immediately upon passage of the tax cuts companies started announcing that they would repatriate funds into the country the I how many started giving bonuses to their employees this is in other words there is a there's a difference in kind you're suggesting well what I'm suggesting is that the economy is playing politics right now in a way that we have not historically I agree that in part I think that would be a mistake to attribute the entire stock market surged to Trump because I was there when Obama was president when that long ago and we were saying yes the economy when this would Obama took over the stock mark was in 9,000 when he left the stock mark was at 17 so the so for us to sit around and go well the stock market only grew under Trump is obviously not true but to Joyce but some of the discrete things the IMF said tax reform milked we know some money's coming back or some things you can it so it's it yeah I think the biggest thing that you can attribute to Trump is not even the tax cuts well we'll see the effects over the coming years I think that what's happening now is the companies are getting smart and what they're doing is they're saying their employees look economic policies matter and so it's not that Apple saw a giant infusion of cash immediately enter their their coffers that soon as the tax cut went through it was them saying to their workers listen tax cuts are good for us and over the next couple years we're going to feel it so here's a thousand dollar check now so you linked the two things right we're not gonna wait for the company to grow over the next two years and then you'll have to sort of into it but something that did not trust Obama they knew they kept their money this is the big thing right and this is a huge angry that all this money is going to come back Trump is right about this he has basically said hey we're open for business and ambitious men like that they like us being open even high taxes are survivable if there's tax stability especially with regulations people had no idea what's gonna happen well this is why I think that you know the economy barring some sort of exigent circumstance it should remain decent so long as Trump doesn't cater to the middle now but this is what this is what's interesting what we saw tonight is actually the best indicator that Trump is going to have to remain in the conservative circle right so one of the things that I think I fear I know Jeremy feared if Trump is president and the Democrats take over Congress he taxed to the center-right he starts to triangulate and he starts to try and cut deals with Democrats it ain't happening is the Democrats won't happen it's not about Trump right yeah I'm sad that tonight he offered a couple of things that Democrats have been hungry for right 1.5 trillion dollars in infrastructure spending yeah and the Democrats are sitting on their hands right right he's talking about legalizing 2 million illegal immigrants and bring in 4 million additional right they'll talk about the legal immigrants that are coming in he said he's gonna end chain migration mark Krikorian is spitting mad because Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies he says yeah the problem is when he says he's gonna end chain migration everybody who's currently on the chain migration waiting list gets in okay so the tom cotton plant originally cut off the chain migration waiting list and people who are on the list for the next year but everybody else has to pull their fun they get their money back and their and their applications go away Trump hasn't done that in his proposal so that means for 17 more years people who are on that chain migration waiting let's get in that's 4 million additional legal immigrants coming into the country in addition to 3.6 million dreamers in addition to 1.8 million dreamers which is bigger than daca right because daca was only like what he did as daca only applied to the people who have actually registered with the federal government he says he wants do it for all the dreamers which is people who haven't even registered with the government yet so he's offering all of these figlia all of these these these what would he call a leap fig leaf that he's offering an olive branch you know I'm looking for thank you he's offering all these olive branches to them rats and they're spitting in his face which means that if they take over in 2018 it's gonna be interminable investigations we're gonna get Democrats going after him on sexual harassment and sexual abuse they're going to investigate his finances they're gonna force vodka and Jared to come and testify in front of Congress they're gonna do all they're gonna subpoena everyone and everything again we're tearing that was not a good look for the Republicans to under Clinton though yeah well they didn't have the media on their side either I mean it'll be interesting to see you know when the media are hammering away and when crit and when Ross Perot doesn't run right if in fact is that the Ross Perot really shivved the Republicans a couple of times in 92 and 96 if there's no third-party candidate in 92 or 96 then Bill Clinton's never president so we'll have to see what happens you know I'm I'm but the good news is for the economy Trump will not sign anything they sent his way right because he's not gonna cut a deal with them right he's not in there's anything the entire offered it seems to me as a trap I mean he's making this offer because he knows I agree the Schumer has telegraphed that he will not accept it so now he can go on Twitter which remember Jerry Twitter is like a million times with the New York Times circulation is Trump's Twitter feed the New York Times has a circulation point five percent of what Trump's Twitter feed is he now goes on Twitter and says hey everything I totally agree this is why I was I was kind of shocked that Ann Coulter I understand that you know and and and Krekorian they have to say what the reality is that what Trump did was not an actual offer to Democrats was him saying swim I will give away the store and you guys still won't make a deal with me because you hate me so sues the art of the deal I mean it really is first time I ever saw him do something in the negotiation where I thought that makes sense there goes the time negotiation is Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer so he's like okay good you guys you think maybe that Donald Trump since becoming president read the art of the deal see what you have to say about it remember if you're watching us on Facebook to go up

can actually reach you in this age of conservative censorship and Alicia even if hey I'm here what you got we got tons of questions but most importantly Edward has a question for Ben that I don't think any of us have the answer to Edward wants to know what does your wife do for a living yes indeed there been rumors a long time she's a doctor Wow greater than John Kasich status man you're the most amazing you should know this by the way she her kid was sick over the weekend she actually texted my wife Rebecca advice and it was after sundown on Saturday because some people tweeted that to me and I was like don't worry they're good Jews they didn't break stuff it was a life-threatening situation she'd answer even on the second no it was fine and she's a very good doctor I will definitely go to her you know once my covered California kicks in Nate asks of Michael I'm going into political science as a college major what tips do you have for me as I go into the leftist world of academia my first one is do not major in political science economics sometimes political science majors do well Barack Obama ben shapiro people have risen to great heights of doing political science I prefer history I think political science used to be a good field I think now they've mostly weeded out the political philosophy aspect of it which is the really substantive aspect of it so my advice to you is to study the ancients I think we would all agree with that don't just study modern political science I mean like the beetle and study what would have been the classical aspects of liberal education - and then and probably keep your head down in your mouth shut because you might you might have a little bit of trouble in college these days if you voice your opinions all right Eric has a question for our God King Jeremy boring God King you seem insightful and borderline omniscient no do you think that Democrats actually believe that sitting for both the anthem and God is a winning political strategy I think that Donald Trump should have actually broken into the national anthem and forced them all to kneel it's mobile what if he had actually played the end of Dinesh's movie I always wonder why they do like an a/b stay to the end they could do that now like bring by the big screen I think it'd be fun no I could you do that could fire people on national TV by the way I do like this comment from Twitter Bravo to the democratic advanced staffer who decided to put Kennedy in front of a broken car on national team yeah I do think that they I think that they are so in their bubble of partisanship which is something that I think we have to be careful about as well they're so deeply in that that they I think they honestly believe that people are sitting at home slow clapping them for keeping their seats and what they what they're forgetting is the lessons as I said before they're typically so much better at media than we are so much better at showmanship than we are but Trump's you know Trump's a carnival barker from way back he's just got their number and so they're forgetting the things that they know and one of those is that the momentum of you can't compete with the momentum of the speech sitting the way they did is sort of like giving the rebuttal to the State of the Union you lose automatically the the reason that Ben I think all of us agree that I'm not not true that this entire sort of episode of the State of the Union the president standing like a monarch in front of the chambers of kasym bold Congress and all the applause and everything it's sort of anti-american I mean there's a reason none of the founders didn't do this Jefferson I did away with it it was just a speech until woodrow will washington's wrote a letter yeah Washington allure Woodrow Wilson decided that he would give this as a speech and it really became the sort of progressive iconography kind of thing and we've tried to embrace it but the the power of that is that it makes the executive powerful that's what the progressive presidents wanted was to show the power of the executive and sitting there makes you seem inept you're already in a situation where the president is more where his power is on full display and I think they were basically showing the guy their necks I mean I think it was a horrible miscalculation well it reminds me a lot of you remember during the the gore Bush debates when Bush would say something and Gore would sigh and hem ha around and it looked really bad cousin like it felt exactly the same yeah patrick has a question for Ben he says why do you hate Knowles with the burning heat and the Sun that's a song I mean have you seen him you sitting here in a smoking jacket and an American flag bowtie what am I supposed to wear and sold more copies of his books than all my books combined and there are zero words in them but there were four years to reach success I thank you for asking that question Randle has a question for Andrew he says Andrew I'm curious because you're clearly a very productive person what does your daily routine look like can you enlighten us as to your discipline ways yes first of all there's no sleeping in my days they did sleeping just does not exist I occasionally doze off like during this conversation completely asleep but normally I'm just awake for 24 hours a day I come in I do my show I do a lot of show prep and then I go home and I write for hours and hours on end and then I go to bed and read constantly and occasionally I must sleep sometime otherwise I'm not human but I don't know when I do I just don't sleepy that's that's the answer and and I I'm gonna say something about that because one of the things that I love about coming to work with these three guys there ain't much one thing that is impressive about all three of you is your discipline you're also well-read you're reading at the office constantly having discussions about books that don't have pictures in them that's really important to a lowly god-king such as myself but even among even in this company Andrew Cleveland's work ethic and discipline towers above I mean you when I first met you you said that you work basically you structure your day in four-hour shifts yeah and that's how you're able to move from project to project the way that you do and have the kind of productivity that you have it's pretty I would just want to say Alicia this is the only nice thing Jeremy has ever seen on camera so I shut this down again Douglas has a question for Ben he wants to know Ben what are your thoughts on video games and do you play any I know I do not play video games I did for a very short period when I was - do when I was a kid but I just honestly sitting in front of a screen for hours at a time why would anyone do that yeah I mean now that I now that I'm older the truth is that now that I have a couple of kids they are my video game I have I have a wife and I spend time with her in the evenings I just don't have I don't have time for a living you tweet you know her doctor' curious position I saw some people asking what is her what is her specialty she's a family physician yep that's why I texted her on Saturday night because I need some family notes my doctor of love but I don't question for this segment guys Ben wants to know zach has a question for Ben he wants to know why you consider yourself a conservative and not a libertarian okay the reason I consider myself a conservative not a libertarian is because on social issues I really believe that there's a social fabric that is necessary and that we have to spend an awful lot of time preserving I think the only problem I have with libertarianism is less about governmental ideology than it is about social ideology there are a lot of libertarians you tend to feel that for example religious institutions community organizations these things are oppressive rather than rather than building of the of the capacity for free and freely govern people so when it comes to governmental policy I call myself a libertarian essentially when it comes to overall worldview I call myself a conservative because I put a lot of focus on the preservation of trust that we have in one another on a day to day level that requires social institutions that are informal and not created by government in order in order to fulfill I don't I want to kick something in there too because it's tempting for us in this room to think of ourselves as libertarians and part of that is a branding issue because the word conservative has some brand problems right especially we speak to LA yeah especially in LA we we all have that various temps worked in the entertainment industry and you can kind of you get a little grace for the word libertarian I think that at a fundamental ideological level on policy I tend to agree with libertarianism I agree with the general notion that basically the government's job is to is only to protect your nose from my fists right that that unless the government is keeping me from infringing upon your rights everything else should be within my rights we're we're libertarianism has begun to lose me as as I explore its roots to go back to Alexander Berkman and some of the early communists they saw libertarianism as a part of their ideological movement they saw libertarianism it's fundamentally a left-wing ideology and it's it seems shocking to us because we think in these very rigid American political terms between big government and small government but what libertarianism is is a utopianist philosophy it's basically akin to communism whereas the Communists believed that the original sin is class the original sin is is wealth divided and if we could do away with that we could sort of have an identity Radice that we all live in the libertarians believe that coercion is original sin hmm and I think that what makes us conservatives the four men in this room is that we believe that original sin is that thing that happened in the garden and so we don't have a utopianist view none of us believe that if the government gets smaller the world would be perfect that's right none of us believe that if we outlaw abortion we'll live in a land of happiness and apples none of us believe that if we just defeat North Korea the last of our enemies will have been vanquished we don't believe if you secure the border the country will say we don't believe that we believe that the world can get better and the world can get worse but only God can redeem and prefer that fundamentally makes us not really well absolutely right there's also an aspect of some branches of libertarianism that actually is is quite anti founding so if you read Albert ngoc right if you ever read if you're even one of the early libertarians a guy who's sort of an influence for William F Buckley you know knock specifically talks about how the founding fathers were busy he buys the Charles Burien philosophy of how the country was found a bunch of property owners seeking to enshrine their own interests and that's why they founded the country the way they did about any element of state as being as being terrible now I'm very anti state when the state is doing the wrong things but there is a purview within which the state is supposed to work and I think that there's the art and sort of anarcho-capitalist wing of the libertarian movement that's pretty wild that's it for a long time I think a conservative libertarian merger is is correct yeah if we if we understand that libertarians are basically right that the government is a problem and libertarians basically understand that conservatives are right that that virtuous behavior is necessary logistical reasons I need to hear true stuffs on this well I mean I think that the question is what is that is the government's role and what is the people's role and I think that that's that's where it comes down to we all believe in the family we all believe in the structure of you know of sexual restraint we all believe in the basic conservative doesn't necessarily mean that the government has the right to enforce those things or it has the right to you know restrict the way individuals behave and that's that's a different thing than saying you know it always bothered me when the when Colin Kaepernick was kneeling for the flag everybody on ESPN said well he is the right to do that and I thought yes but nobody's addressing the question of whether it's right yeah do that which is a different question the question of virtue is is a really big one this is what I think a lot of libertarians miss the boat because there's an implication that virtue is actually antithetical to small government that if virtue exists and they make a mistake that virgins the fill pillar of smoke right but I think that this is something that's missed and it's even missed among some Strauss and philosophers who attempt to suggest that when you read Plato's Republic and Plato is talking about his kind of utopian vision of the minute you talk about whether human virtue is possible does the government have to coerce you into virtue that's right right and and the answer is no the government doesn't have to correspond to virtue but in order for you to make that argument you actually have to be virtuous on your own you know and any Plato did write the laws after he wrote the Republic sort of saying you know like okay we're not going to really is Strauss is read on Plato Yeah right he actually his read on Plato is that is that Plato's Republic is basically a parody of utopian philosophy with regard to building so novel is so utopia so very happy to announce that we have one guest we maybe thought the best and the brightest and the conservative movement they all turned us down that is a Boulevard brought by our very own hands Denis is not a Cuban cigar fan I have wagered that the only Cuban cigar you would actually enjoy is this one it's the most robust Cuban cigar the bellicose so far so good if you don't like just a yes we do have a Padron just in case you want it we destroy I want you to try the Hawaii everybody good to be here you don't know that I I welled up in tears a few times at the Ramiro so rabbit that's his that age so much that is an interesting question so that is an interesting question is it my age or is it that it was particularly heart-rending stuff when the Korean yeah that veins the crutches yeah I don't know he was Koreans like most Asians are very controlled yep they don't emote easily he was fighting back tears that the American people were cheering him that he got to freedom I don't know how you don't well up I mean if there's there are very few times the left and right can agree I think there unbridgeable divides between them but if that didn't move you there is something wrong with you emotionally and morally the warm beers what their what their son suffered happen yeah the the couples who lost their kids to to the the gangs I mean I mean these were these were powerful and you know they're all they're all fighting back tears maybe it happens all the time I usually tend to read so tubes and State of the Union addresses and and so maybe that's why you know I think this was particularly moving but I'm asking you was it you know I think I think it was and I also think it's important that Trump understands the power of that when you listen to the Democrats talk about immigration specifically they never talk about the rule of law they never talk about the theory of what what makes a nation a nation they only talk about the emotion of individuals and Trump basic and plays their game right back at them this is Laurie saying yes there is a sad-eyed immigrant but here is also a sad person who lost a job to an illegal image and this Americans are dreamers too that was a great that was awesome although it didn't match Jeremy's line when the guy held up his crutches and Jeremy said god bless us everyone see your name come up on the screen how did that originate are you probably one of these be careful what you wish for sort of it I will say though that I did not anoint myself God King Andrew clay was me and I didn't mean it you know like like an ancient ruler of Egypt not like an actual God if you are here to free your people we've been trying to what well did you hear the Kennedy response the first it's actually I I have nothing funny to say about that speech it was disgusting yep it was demagogic in the extreme with you okay I'll give you my the worst of his all demagoguery speech you build the wall our generation will tear it down last while I wrote in my syndicated column today why the left is is forever more immigrants they don't believe in the nation-state that is what this guy doesn't believe in the nation-state the left has never done at proletariat of the world unite not Germans unite not Russians unite workers of the world unite as the end of a communist manifesto leftism never believed in the nation-state I'm sure you all know a Superman gave up his American citizenship in the comic strip just a few years ago he's now a citizen of the world that's right this is what they believe in but we don't our team doesn't campaign on this we don't educate America please understand this guy Kennedy represents the Democratic Party which doesn't believe in borders do you understand that Americans that's the issue this comes on the heels of a speech in which the Democrat as well as we've been discussing sat for the national anthem sat for the flag who shall ordinary dirt and you were watching the State of the Union yeah yeah go on there's a applause line for the flag oh that's right yes an applause line for the anthem they set an applause line for American prosperity they set think they're sitting in opposition to Trump but they're actually revealing what you're saying that's exact don't believe in America they don't believe in patriotism they don't believe that I hope that people see that because I think we all in this room agree that on that but I think that they don't see me and Ted you need to educate them all of us do for sure for sure but I think that this is the job that the media's done so well is we all revolve around the poll of Trump I mean Trump is the center of gravity now and so that means that everything on the right and the left has been reflected through the prism of how does this affect President Trump and his administration as opposed to what do Democrats actually think and is this revealing of their thinking or is it more that they're just opposing Trump personally because they're trying to use Trump's personal and popularity as a club to beat ideas that are actually good and this is a perfect example by the way I think the reason that you're emotional about this is not because Obama didn't tell stories he did it's that the stories that were told tonight were stories that we feel have been ignored for literally more at least a decade and probably some of the Bush administration - maybe longer than that you know it specifically when the the victims of illegal immigration are sitting there and cried the story that was told about the the family that adopted the kid megha what literally this week the Democrats voted down a law that would have prevented abortion past 20 weeks and paying their I mean I tweeted it out but it's true Cecile Richards would have said too that heroin mom just abort the kid then you don't have a problem shouldn't been talking about saving the kid and adopting the kid and so when we hear these stories it feels like when Trump has talked about the Forgotten man on this stuff we aren't the Forgotten people right these are the stories that haven't been told for most of my life right and so even I who have not been a fan of the president for a lot of his rhetoric that kind of rhetoric is is really effective and really meaningful and especially when the Democrats are so out of character so out of the box that they they say things now like America is is no better than North Korea like they literally say do it and then we show a guy from North Korea holding up his crutches saying I got out of there and like well if you can't see this dichotomy you don't know what you're what you're looking has been describing America as an asshole for the last 25 years yeah I mean Steven Lee right sure yeah the other day Stephen Colbert did it openly on the show is that right well because after Trump made the asshole comments about other countries yeah and which by the way is it isn't arguably true that there are other countries that are asked oh you wrote that in your piece I quoted it yeah I mean there's there's just no question about it but Stephen Colbert got up and said America's the real asshole because we elected Trump and then you know Bono at the Grammys got up and said thank God for s whole countries cuz if it weren't for s whole countries we wouldn't have all these people here and so no countries well they actually said that during the Grammys and that no I'm not way to forgive me I don't understand this point he said if it weren't for s whole countries we wouldn't have all these people here we wouldn't have great people come to America but that's not a reason to bless us all countries it's a reason to bless the people who came so he's wished but at least there's that like tantamount to agreeing with the president I don't you know I hate to take a more cynical view about this but according to Pew Research the people that the Democrats would give amnesty to today vote Democrat over Republican identify Democrat over republican between three times at the low in 1820 a v20 it is up to eight point seven five times more like that's right high-end yeah that it that is the height of demagoguery totally but you know Dennis with something you said about about the idea of borders and the idea of countries specifically you know there's there's no question none of us would disagree that this is becoming a global world I mean there's not there's no way to stop it becoming a global world I can I can go on the computer and talk to somebody across the world in a minute the question is what does that look like does that look like one bland complete you know one people with one idea when no competition what Trump is basically saying is yeah we're in the business of America okay it's a global market our market is America our business in America and that is a very powerful idea I mean that's an idea this is one's week so I feel comfortable quoting the Bible to God blesses Abraham and says you through you and this is fascinating we'll be blessed all the families of the earth and all the nations of the earth gods for those of us who believe that this stuff is in a fairy tale God's ideal is indeed that the world has families and by that is meant a nuclear family and biblically speaking and Nations the abolition of nations is a catastrophe is the Tower of Babel right and that is what they want to do abolish the nation-state of course it's a global world you know it's an invitation it is really hard on me because of Prager University and I got an invitation just in the last last couple of months from young people in in the country of Georgia and Romania to speak to them they don't hear these ideas I'm not this is not an advertisement for Prager University its advertisement for you for us for our values I when I go to Romania and I took the speech and when I go I want Romania to stay Romania it is a healthy thing to feel a bond that is specific to me a Romanian that but to the to the left what I just said is quasi fascism so in in the New Testament Paul says that in Christ there's neither male nor female Jew nor Greek slave nor free and one of my thoughts about the left is if it's a Christian virtue to think that as God that God will one day redeem the world in such a way that those boundaries won't exist between us anymore what the left wants to do is put together things that God has separated without God oh when you take God out of that equation there is no redemption and putting those things back together you know the the removal of the nation as a secular of the nation-state as a secular exercise isn't holy it's not it's not part of what I would see is the design of the earth that the earth has designed it was separated by God only he had the right to separate it only he has the right in his own time to put it back together that's but but the left and we were talking before he walked in about the utopianism of libertarian hermit yep not the left wants to on the left is still busy doing what they were doing in the guggenheim Azhar they offer the oh it's too terrible to forget I'll finish your story don't wanna leave we exclusively ash in the ladder with Crowder's mug which can be yours for $9.99 you wanted to find this - crazy you realize that what I have to donate to this set you guys do not have a proper ashtray do you care about secondhand smoke later I know I'll be great I'm healthier today listen to this the guggenheim had this about a year ago the their newest exhibit is in all gold solid gold toilet that's a very expensive made by an italian court on court artists and it operates it actually flushes you pay a fee at the Guggenheim and you can urinate or defecate into the toilet itself is important because the again the godless world of the of the left arts is filled with scatters it's the scatological course they love fecal matter urine menstrual blood mucus there they love it I can't wait to see my quote out of context yeah but here's the punchline you know what the name of the toilet the the exhibits name is America Oh you can literally defecate and urinate on America at the Guggenheim well I can become what they did to the Virgin Mary look at what they did in His Christ they are obsessed with it and all of these the women's March and all of the Democrat marches it's just profanities it's just obscenities and vulgar isms so they they yell at Donald Trump for using naughty language every once in a while their entire political activism is right but it makes perfect it makes perfect sense you remove the spirit you remove God what are you left with them would that this is what you're left with right moments or Nothing baby not to course we're animals yeah and and and it and it does you know I always do feel people attack the left as being somehow evil but they are they are following the logic of the spiritual less world right perfect sense well I mean that you're gonna have to blame the the problems the mankind sees on something then and so first so for us we blame it on human nature we say the human beings are inherently flawed and this is Julie that it is why we set all these checks and balances and we inculcate virtue in our children and this is why you need religion this is why you need God and they can't do that because that automatically leads to God the minute you say human nature is flawed it's the only way that you can cure that is by reaching beyond ourselves to our Creator I can't deal with that so instead what they say is know what's really made human beings flawed is the rules so if we just violate every taboo right then suddenly human beings will be will be cured and elevated and so they think they're actually doing a service by freeing man of our of our weird hang-ups about our fetishism is about not glorifying pee and poo and so now we're going to or something I'm gonna make man greater and the corollary of that is that your dignity and your self-respect come from me that in other words I have to approve of you in order for you have to have self-respect so if you're gay if you're transsexual if you're whatever it may be the problem you have is not that you're at odds with some kind of archetype in yourself or some kind of god-given archetype the problem you have is that I don't accept you as you are and this is it it was something that I was pointing out about the Grammys on my show and that was the unbelievable focus of me too was supposedly about more than just don't molest and harass women it was supposedly about female dignity right so - or they're promoting the female dignity they've got women dancing on strange like strippers I mean that and until these two things do not coincide now it's a free country can do what you want but the idea that this is somehow elevating the dignity of women and that if I don't grant you dignity it when you are doing something that is inherently undignified right that somehow I am assaulting your sense of dignity that's your problem right it's my problem for not changing what the word dignity means but what you're doing right now is it the the the lapse into complete subjectivism is is francis why in the 1950s dwight eisenhower put in the Gettysburg Address that we were one nation under God that was a little bit too subtle okay take it back to Elisha and take a few more questions one last time questions that are being submitted on Facebook you'll be sure you with us I am still here I'm still in the bunker and thank the vegetable trade didn't make it to me 30 miles away so didn't even know I didn't even notice it was missing Johnny K says gentlemen I believe you're blocked and deleted YouTube livestream still has more viewers than did Joe Kennedy's response and then if you weren't with us YouTube blocked our livestream for playing the State of the Union we were using the c-span which is owned by the government using the c-span feed which is public domain YouTube sort of affiliate The Young Turks was using the same stream and they were not blocked but of course there's no bias I don't want you to get the wrong idea for those who don't know Prager University is currently suing YouTube for discrimination that was right by the oh I'll tell you a story little Alicia give me more yeah I have a powerful anecdote okay fine so they blocked they've not blocked but they have put on the restricted list 40 of the pre university video it must have been with very very the right graphic stuff like the history of the Korean War we all know Victor Davis Hanson so this this is a proof of proofs I debated I debated a left-wing jus I'm I'm a conservative Jew I debated a left-wing Jew at the biggest temple in San Francisco last month of a guy from J Street okay that debate is now on the restricted list oh my goodness so half of it is a leftist speaking but I feel that I prevailed in that debate this is now not bragging because that's the only possible reason they would restrict the conservative may have looked good with a leftist that cannot be seen 50% conservative is too much concern Alicia yeah Ian hatch says the question for everyone there including Dennis that he wants to know who is your a favorite all-time historical military figure mmm gosh guys I mean come on Phil Cohen it's now well known he was actually a barber the troops I forgive me Alicia comes out for there were so many great there's no favorite I don't have a thing yeah there were too many great who's your favorite is George Washington because George was yeah figured out that you could lose forever and still win the war if you knew her and that is one of the great she was one of the great significant great empires great empires lose wars lose battles continually but win the war and that was George Washington's strategy so for me I would have to I'd have to go with either Sherman or with or with McArthur who was correct about the Korean War I know people the reason that the reason that China still exists as a communist slave state is because we did not listen to Douglas MacArthur about the necessity for taking out China emigrate or just just I agree with you I just want to say on behalf of Truman he the the fear of a war with China was real yeah oh yeah I must say there are some there are some good Pope's at the Battle of Lepanto the wars there was there were the First Crusade but I will I'd actually like to give it to a Winston Churchill he's very popular now because when well because Winston Churchill so you see this is a military leader yes military into the you know money wasn't it wasn't so there's a wonderful painting from 1919 that depicts all of the leaders of World War one they're talking about a happy they are about the peace and there's only a light shining on Churchill he's looking out with his head in his hands he's so upset and Winston Churchill had exactly the one head in 19 1919 ya begun in 1999 went on forever the guy died before was finished but the Winston Churchill addict he flew airplanes even though he was a terrible pilot and he crashed the multiple times the third time Winston Churchill crashed an airplane it was nearly fatal it was a really terrible crash and he was a war hero of bar war and less over for one as First Lord of the Admiralty but he came on they said aren't you afraid of dying why do you keep flying these planes you're obviously a terrible pilot and he said I love life but I do not fear death and that is exactly the right attitude those are words slip don't just say it well I'm not afraid of death I love life yeah but I do not fear death by the way it was largely my love of the absurd that I said Phil : but there was an element of truth to that it's they're not leaders but the the average soldier going on to the Normandy Beach yeah now is the person I first think of when I think of heroes that's right in the military role good good point all right Charles has a question for Dennis mr. Prager which room in your estimation is nicer the god-king jeremy boring his headquarters or your home library where you film your Prager you fireside chats Wow that's a great question since I could smoke a cigar in both this question is from Colby and it's for everyone in the room what books would you put on a mandatory reading list for college students I have a list by the way at Dennis Prager comm Alicia I have I have a list and Joe just give a couple of cacus yeah thanks so the fact that I'm hesitating is this a bad time the Bible is so magnificent but it needs to be understood it's like you can't read Shakespeare today without a commentary and let me make a plug I've never plugged the book in my life this is a cause not a book nobody writes a commentary on the Bible to make a lot of money so I'll start with that on April 2nd my comment a hundred thirty thousand word commentary on the book of Exodus is coming out well and to explain its greatness beyond that man search for minute meaning by Viktor Frankl changed my life in high school I realized we only have one ultimate freedom when everything else is taken away there is still one that cannot be taken away how we react to what it's to us you can't choose cancer you can't choose to be hit by a drunk driver you can't choose to have troubled parents or troubled children or whatever but you can choose how you react so I'll put those in traffic Ben and I were having this conversation recently because of a little secret project we're working on ear and we had a similar concern about the bible is certainly the book of Genesis in the book of John are two seminal works to understand Western civilization you need to understand Genesis and John and I'll say that long before we knew one another I listened to your teachings on Genesis that you did it at university of judah University of Judaism it was really helped shape a lot of my thinking about my relationship thank you but it is difficult to to point people to the Bible without any kind of anchoring that's why I hope this will inaugurate I'm doing the first five books and Exodus I started with a review copy you're not gonna give it to me until it's already out I'm gonna give it to you the second I have one okay you know what you want one in Word format read it I mean I love that stuff so yeah I know you do I know we both do because we come from a similar world where you you will totally relate and you will find this interesting I don't read fast I'll bet you do right and but I know one of the reasons I don't we both went to yeshiva which is half day Jewish Studies in Hebrew half day in secular studies in English it's very intense and we both went through high school different ones obviously and even at different times if you can tell but the but there was a brilliant way of learning why does it say this and not this right yes right ice I read newspaper articles like that why did the New York Times use this word but not this word and and it it slows me down but I really understand what's going on by doing that I'll give you one example this was Bruce her shinsen gave this example Fidel Castro was always the Cuban leader but a right-wing dictator in nicker agua or Dominican Republic was a dictator right there were no communist dictators in the new york times right there were only right-wing dictators i don't think we should leave out i mean i would definitely put the bible and shakespeare and i i would trust people to find their way back you know to the commentaries i think that if you read the bible with an open mind and you don't go in with the perversely anti-biblical mentality of the new so we're just going in to just be angry about pictures in a way I think that you just said something important because I was going to suggest that you guys read a lot of nonfiction I read fiction and I find truth in fiction I'm a story Tom a Hollywood guy when you say the bible and shakespeare i think you are providing a commentary on the Bible that's right sure there is a comedy of course truth fiction should lead you to the truth I also think I also think we could not leave out some Plato and Aristotle and specifically the some Plato's symposium look oh my email in ethics these have to be done I think they do have to be what I'm I guess when I'm picturing when when we were asked this question is a silence sort of where we have nothing else but this what would I start with and it would be the resume because when it comes to books that I would just start with that don't require commentary and start with like economics in one lesson by Henry Hazlitt may be a history of the American people by Paul Johnson sir you're great things then but see this is because because this is tell me you can read on but this is stuff that you can read on your own and understand but in terms of kind of foundations of Western civilization of course if you're gonna start with the basics but you require a teacher I mean all the stuff requires are wrong I mean in the Jewish in the inside of the Jewish parlance to learn Plato Aristotle it's very difficult to learn I know because I'm doing some remedial reading of it now yeah and and it really is something that has to be commented upon and taught and even if you read natural right in history by Strauss which is a commentary on the stuff you need a commentary on Strauss in order to understand Strauss yeah are we leaving out the obvious reasons to vote for Democrats that really needs a teacher really does have the guy I am here for you and I would also I would a lot of books aren't taught anymore they used to be you they would be taught so Dante I think is not taught as much I think the comedy offers as much as it were all white a little swarthy is worthwhile these philosophers are tough I mean reading reading Conte is almost impossible right oh so what so it's so destroyed rules you're almost better off reading will Durant's summary of various philosophers and their main points then actually struggling through the word by word of something are you mister for Aristotle by the way who's actually pretty tourism and the ethics are very basic very dramatic and quite clear and and that you can those are the foundations you can't have the gut you can't have the Jenga tower starting at the top I mean I totally agree I mean in the body not only do I agree with this I'm writing a book on it the book and the book is about the the why it is that we have fallen into political tribalism so strongly and it seems to me that it's because we have a god-shaped and reason shaped hole in our hearts that's now being filled with passion and tribalism so and so what the first third of the book is just tracing the foundations of Western civilization that nobody learned so there's a full chapter on the Hebrew Bible and then there's a full chapter on Plato and Aristotle and then there's a chapter on the New Testament and it literally moves forward in history like that through Aquinas I'm right now I am up to I'm up to Aquinas and then I actually get to Machiavelli at the moderns yeah but it but it's this stuff is not taught at all so I'm trying to I'm trying to simplify it enough that people can actually understand Alicia did you expect such a law not for me that's for the audience the audience I'm like wait what was the question just wanted to know what the tentative title is the destruction of the American soul Bradon large says any list without fifty shades of gray trilogy on it okay final question is from Melissa she has a question for Dennis and Andrew the most wise gentleman in the room she says she actually called you she calls you wise elders I mean hey that's in the Bible we're supposed to respect you right I mean at the show Friday night Melissa says why oh why have you lived in California for so long when does it become too wacky a state to live in that's a great question that was an excellent question I think well it was it who one of you I think made the point and maybe what I know it wasn't me that's all I could say and I never want to take credit for an idea that is in mine wheat that's another thing you learn in yeshiva right but somebody pointed out that Southern California is really the hotbed of young and resurgent conservatism yeah I mean all of our groups and our our own selves are just examples of it so it's an interesting phenomenon I don't I can't fully explain it personally I'm sorry fire refines we're all why artists find enough not well you know they have City Journal they have some good stuff but but III will but and San Francisco doesn't have any of this so it's Southern California but I will say this the truth is I love it here I I hate to admit it what I do and I'm I bet you do too to a large extent and yeah and you know what there are a lot of wonderful people here that's the thing there really are a lot of wonderful people and also I I'm a big believer that without friends it's very hard to navigate life that's smallest and my friends are here here we do so we're his friends but he doesn't acknowledge a different answer I am a person who loves the countryside I love being by myself I love being out in the wilderness and yes used to winter in New Hampshire yeah and yet I have spent I have spent most of Connecticut I've spent most of my life in coastal cities and the reason for that is I am a culture guy and the culture creator and I'm someone who believes in fighting for the culture and one of the things that drives me crazy about conservatives is they want to affect the culture but they don't want to get the mud of the culture on their hands and I believe in being part of this of this enterprise part of the centrosome party and the culture is created no matter what anybody thinks is created in LA and it's created in New York and even though I am NOT always comfortable in these cities I'm really comfortable in these businesses to thrive here doing what you do even if it means fighting my corner which I don't mind one of the I give a little speech sometimes to young conservatives who want to move into politics or entertainment and they're usually in the groups that I tend to speak to young Christian idealistic often home-schooled and I often tell them that the three most corrupting influences ever devised by man or wealth power and fame but we all hope to willed those very powers in some way in service of our values and one of the things that I cautioned them about is you will be scarred you know Moses didn't get dinner the land of promise and we I think we've all burned our fingers a little bit with our pursuits but at the same time God's put us in a position where we've been able to willed them on behalf of what's good to your point though you said so eloquently about friendship and I agree with that CS Lewis says you have to live where your friends are but Don Henley mmm said it this way about LA let's go down to the sunset grill watch the working girls go by watch the basket people walk around and mumbles gaze out at the Auburn sky maybe we'll leave come springtime meanwhile we'll have another beer what would we do without these jerks anyway and besides that all our friends are Wow Alicia thank you so much and to everyone watching on Facebook and previously on YouTube we're grateful for your time tonight grateful that you hung out with us for a little bit and are thankful for your questions we're gonna let Alicia go home and have a wife and we're gonna wrap up with ten more minutes of visiting together and hope to see you all back tomorrow morning for the guys and all their and all their content bye guys thanks you told me we have to do a show tomorrow are you ready for a great Fame story yeah so what if it doesn't have groupies now if I carry this with others this was a truly it was just was a truly great humbling moment for me so I feel funny saying but it's still stupid not said I I am all not always but I every day somebody recognizes me okay it's inevitable I've been my guest you on planet Earth pick me up about a year and a half ago and this young Hispanic woman keeps looking at me which is already flattering and that's great and so on and that happens a lot of people are debating whether they should come over okay finally she gathers the courage to walk over and she goes are you and whenever people go are you as it's sort of a joke I go yes pleasure to meet you and then so I goes are you and I go yes Phil Jackson is explaining I don't walk around saying not wearing me out okay no one's ever going to think I work in the bath one of the great comments on Facebook that I saw a second ago was a traitor and Shapiro in the same room is like having the white and green Power Ranger on the same so now and now when I asked just randomly Dennis you even you don't read fiction much correct okay so did but you have read some I assume you've read our fiction book oh of course I mean I can't graduate high school without having burned college and by the way I love great fiction I just had to make a decision at a grand point where do you spend your that's right yeah yes that was it okay but I'll ask you because it's it off the beaten track question so what let's go around and do like two favorite fiction books hmm cuz I that's kind of fun do you know oddly enough this really stayed with me of a book by émile zola l'assommoir which is the the butchery I lived it I lived in France and was of the 19th century and I it made a deep impact and here's another one that people probably never heard of it's probably because I I specialized in communist affairs I was at the Russian Institute at Columbia and our study Russian I've been to almost all the communist countries and here's a novel which absolutely competes with 1984 to explain what life in an animal farm what life under communism is like it's one of the least well-known books of aim Rand we the living yeah oh yeah that really gives you an idea of what life under communism is okay drew since you're the most well-read person in the room when it comes to fiction I think by a long shot yeah well I mean I always say that the the novel that affected me most be out by a long shot his crime and punishment by nineteen the first time I was 19 the first time I read it I was surrounded by the new relativists who are just rising up the new multiculturalist and and Dostoevsky basically makes the case through an incredible great mystery suspense novel he makes the case that there is a moral fad to the world the cock was right there was a moral law within a starry sky above and those are the two realities and I read that book and I remember putting it down and and literally putting my face in my hands and thinking that's right that's undeniable you cannot deny that and it changed the course of my life it turned the ship of my life toward now it's gone I'm gonna give you a gift that will Bowl over any Russian okay ready this is Crime and Punishment in Russian crystalline yet not kazamia as I always say Dennis Prager colluded with the Russian and since we're doing two books only recently I read this like two years ago the most entertaining novel I have ever read it's for I'm I'm a slow reader I am I think I may be a little dyslexic got so slow this book is 1,400 pages long I read the last 400 pages in a single day and that is the count of monte cristo de mais les fender dumbass amazing yes he's so great but but this book is so entertaining because it starts out as a typical you know what call swashbuckler terrain swashbuckling adventure and then it becomes this deep meditation on the romance of revenge and it's really a book about how revenge belongs to God and yes Jim cow feels pretty good I hear it's pretty good it's pretty good I like that man yeah because this book just did you know did you know it's his story about Alexander tomorrow he was not paid by the work he's paid by the line so yeah show that so really so what was he was paid boy Dickens was supposedly paid by the word but he was actually paid by the installments I think by today but the the story about Deema is that he would write characters who would only say these very short lines of dialogue like one-word dialogue specifically in order to pad his count and so when the newspaper came back to because all these things were sterilized when the newspaper came back to him and said we're no longer than paid by the line he killed off one of his characters the writers life man Crime and Punishment thing I got off one of the best one of the best tweets I've ever gotten off and no one got of course was there's a story about in Russia a dog shot its owner like got a hold of a gun and shot its owner and so I tweeted out something like and I want to get the wording correct it was something like why would a good dog let bad things happen you know the wonderful thing about crime and punishment is it is a an answer to me Jay but Nietzsche hadn't published anything yet and he just dust actually did this continually he saw communism coming he was a seer he was a genuine seer and he saw this argument coming down the pike and he answered it before anybody made it he knows have a favorite translator by the way what's the latest one how can you name it no Constance Garnett is really dated and she also would cut anything dirt she was like a nice Victorian Maiden it's been kind of anything sexual out of the the newest one by it's by a married couple whose name I don't remember but it's by - a man and a woman is excellent I think you just translated war and peace also great revelation it's really really good s and their and their crime and punishment which I read only a couple years ago it's great so Nolte you actually read books you know that's not right occasionally so yeah I read more than I write that's for sure I well I hate to be the poor man's Andrew flavin I woods my favorite novel is a crime and punishment I thought I was the poor man's the one I would recommend that isn't read a lot but I think is really good is eeprom SE Sposi by Mun Sony it's an I'll never be taught because of that it's a it's the betrothed it's about the betrothed so it's a wonderful you know it's a it's a wonderful novel and not a soul reads that other than people who read Italian and it but it's really good you should definitely read it it's much below yeah I've only read about five or six novels in my life and that you know that is one of my favorite novels is also one of your favorite novels I always steal it because it's it's a better your favorite novel than mine I'm gonna go with a popular piece of Pulp Fiction modern fiction because it affected me at a young age in the same way that crime and punishment affected you and then it helps shape my view of the world where I was when I was in a theologically and politically formative time and it's by a living author named Stephen lawhead and it's called it's just I know this thing you get to clean this one you you recommended it to me so it's actually a trilogy of books about Arthurian the dragon sight now and I read this when I was 18 years old I had an overnight radio station on today's hit country k4 below yeah and as I was playing where was a in Lubbock Texas metropolis or oh you're for a little bit and I read these books which were really about the collapse of Romanism in Britain and the beginning of Christianity and and I recommend them been you've read they're very good and they they really helped teach me about what motivates people and I think that's what great fiction can do they say that's what great store great film helps us understand what calm you our motivations I'll brag on Clavin for a moment and say that I think Andrew where your fiction is at its best is when you write the internal monologue of a man what he actually is thinking about Jerry I want to push you to actually give up the thriller writing and just write a book that is an internal model your book the great good thing is so that because it basically is that it's just your internal monologue so I mean if you did that I'll go a different direction talk about my least favorite book and it's a it's a book of just the last couple of years and it's called based on the true story by Norm Macdonald and this book which the four of us read pissed me off it's it's supposed to be a celebrity tell-all only one of those salacious details yeah and and the only actual telling all that he does is a story about him going to prison which I don't even think is true and the big reveal that Ronnie Dangerfield got no respect I feel like this is the worst book yes it's more on carrot top you know the worst book is reasons to vote Democrat that Michael it's a quick read I mean let's say that Martel a terrible memoir as novels go based on a true story is the funniest thing plug in for in terms of funniest things I've ever read that aren't fiction Adam Carolla's first book in 50 years we'll all be checks hysterically funny but as far as favorite novels for me so Mike Mike anti-communist novel since we all have an obligatory one is darkness at noon by Arthur Kessler awkward which nobody's read now it's amazing it was really short quickly yeah and it's just fantastic Moby Dick was it was my favorite book for many many years because III think that every if you're a religious person you haven't gone through the struggle of why does God do what he does which of course is the same thing as crime punishment yeah a really more of Brothers Karamazov then you haven't been a religious person like the great myth about religious people is that we don't think about these things all the time the whole day you know it's when when you talk to people like when I when I when all debate when I'll debate Sam the Senators and we'll talk about atheism and he'll act like the the problem of theodicy has never occurred to religious people forgive me I have to tell you this is this quick anecdote I was invited to their credit by the American atheist the biggest atheist organization to debate there their head in Minneapolis a number of years ago after or during the debate I looked at the audience all of whom are atheists and I said would you raise your hand if anything ever happens like the birth of your own child that ever ever even prompts you to question your atheism not one hand Wow Wow yeah that's a great sewer then I said you know I don't I've never been with a religious person who didn't question there's a great no this is right you don't a theist are significantly more religious than religious people like this actually said this sam harris intimated actually said to him you're a more religious person than I am and I'm the one on stage wearing a yarmulke but it didn't but yes a Moby Dick is up there the the the pasteboard masks speech if you haven't read the book the speech where we're a had talks specifically about how he sees Moby Dick as a pasteboard masks and if you can pierce through the pasteboard masks and get it God I mean the whole story is really about him trying to take revenge on God for having sent this whale to cripple them and it's it's just it's just fantastic so I love that book there's a there's a book that my minor Thorian book is actually th Weitz once and future king now the second half of that book is fantastic first half so long but second half is really great but a book that nobody knows but I recommended to Drew and you liked it was every man died was a good life prevalent as alone yeah by Hans falada which is a little-known German author who lived under the Nazis was imprisoned under the Nazis and the entire book is about this couple it's just fantastic it's about this couple these older couple whose son was in the German army and has died in the German army and now that and now that couple is trying to figure out a way to kind of live with each other and they're so angry that their son has been killed in Hitler's war that they decide that the only way they can stand up against this is to put out these pamphlets these propaganda pamphlets anonymously just in the middle of the public thoroughfare and it's and the whole thing is about how they're drawn closer together as human beings by fighting for this cause even though they know that the cause isn't gonna do any good and they know that this is in essence futile but they fall in love with the romanticism of the cause and it's it's just it really is it's great writing action it's a weird book because it's such a bleak story but but it's really uplifting you're like wow that works I know I love that feeling I mean it's rare that it's like a Shakespearean tragedy like I'm finishing Shakespearean tragedy and there's something about it where you don't feel like this is uh I'm trying member in the name of the Walter Kerr the former critic for the New York Times say he brought wrote a book called comedy and tragedy and what he said is that comedy in the end is slightly depressing and tragedy in the end is slightly uplifting guys brawl in cell block 9 we can live on the air for four hours now and there are still 2,000 people braving it with us and I feel like it would be the service to keep them up too much long yeah and let me just say this has been exactly what I had hoped for which is not just us talking about politics all night but us actually just enjoying each other's company and having the kind of conversations that we get to have with one another on a regular basis but that other people don't really get to ever hear us having because they usually just get the product right the result of these conversations is what makes the dennis prager shows what makes the ben shapiro show makes the Andrew Clayman show those just make stuff up completely different but this is this is the beauty of the beautiful part of our life and the beautiful part I think of our working relationship so I want to thank all of you for being a part of it tonight though I do think that we should end with a political observation since that is our mo mo and so if we just go around and very briefly the speech tonight I think we all have similar feelings about State of the Union generally but what do we think is coming you know that's the number one thing that people want to know when they ask us questions in the in the thread and elsewhere they want to know what we think is coming you know people especially in this media environment don't feel like they're getting they don't feel like they're getting a straight answer and they feel unsettled they don't know what's coming we don't know what's coming either that's not our purview but what is the political season what's in front of us where do you think that Trump's next move is going to be and is it something that people on our you know conservatives should look forward to or be concerned about you're looking at me how can it you oh I know what's coming actually and I never predict the future more hate the the left yells at us for hate was there a word of hate said at least since I've been here or heard you guys before they yell at us for hate but I never hear the hate that they're talking about I I don't know where where is it I guess I'm oblivious to it but I don't see it I don't hear it they hate they hate us all of us it's not just Trump they wouldn't hate pence they wouldn't hate Cruz I mean please they hated george w bush the mr. compassion the nice guy yeah frightening Li so but that's what's coming and we never try to shut them up no we don't and look I understand with this I whenever I talk privately with republican congressmen or senators I have the same exact message you are not when you run for office you are not only running you must not only run against your opponent you must explain to the voters the left is destroying Western civilization generally an America specifically that's why you have to vote for me even if you don't like me because we this party the Republican with all its fools and flaws and everything is is is the boy with the finger in his dike the left doesn't give a damn about retaining America as America and you if you say that that's powerful did use that do you agree with desk every Republican should ask the person they're running against do you agree with congressman Kennedy that this if we build a wall you'll tear it down they will that that it that is I want to know your answer am i worthy opponent here in Missouri that's that's what needs to be done the big issues you must get onto the big issues and and that's the only way that we have to educate Americans about the threat that they pose so that I mean I I obviously grew the 30,000 foot analysis what's gonna happen next tomorrow morning storms gonna tweet something and we'll talk about the State of the Union I mean I think that the next thing that happens this week because I mean I have a better track record to predicting what happens this week three months out and Michael Knowles has a check to prove it others many others but I think that the the the memo the release of this house intelligence memo which is gonna happen later this week is gonna blow all of the coverage of the State of the Union off the map everybody's gonna be talking about the State of the Union for the next 30 seconds as soon as we sign off that's pretty much it and then the memo I mean from apparently wants to release this memo and so we're gonna get a giant fight over a memo whose underlying intelligence no one in the public has read and this I think is deeply troubling I think that people want the fight more than they want to know what the fight is about anymore and we have to this is why I agree with Dennis that we have to get back to fundamental principles but that also requires a certain level of intellectual honesty so before I condemn the entire FB consign the entire FBI to the flames of perdition and say that everything the FBI is doing on anything or special accounts or Mueller that all of that stuff is nonsense I want to see all the information come out so I think that we not only as conservatives but just as decent human beings we should say let's see all the information let's call let's call lies what they are I mean the idea that Trump Russia collusion there's been no evidence to prove that whatsoever but let's also wait for all the information to come out because if we don't we're gonna get dragged into a really nasty partisan fight particular over the next couple weeks with the Democrats releasing their memo and noonas releasing his memo and none of the underlying material being released into the public and we're gonna hear Republicans claiming that the FBI needs to be shut down and then provide us credit than to declassify the fine I want the president says you classify as much of this as humanly possible so we can get to the bottom of this and then we can actually determine what's real and what's false and by the way it's quite possible that the FBI did nothing wrong in launching the investigation but still came up with nothing right it is quite possible that all of that the FBI was compromised on Hillary but not compromised on Trump Russia it's possible they were compromised on everything but what I like and I think what we're we're conservators are gonna be safe is is not by making bets on stuff that we don't know but simply by saying things that we do and right now we just don't have enough information to say what's going on yet I think you know just as my role in our group I have to take a somewhat broader cultural view I think we are in a strangely beautiful moment I think that for the last maybe 50 years a fog a smothering fog of political correct silence has been wrapping itself around us and silencing not only what we say but sometimes even what we are allowed to think and I think that fog has been blown away and it has not just been blown away by Trump he's a representative of the fact that the people in America are not like the people in Europe they will not sit and mutter into their beer they will ultimately rise up and say you know what you're lying we won't lie we're not going to tell lies and suddenly it has become alright to speak the facts again not you know as you say then it's not hateful facts it's not hateful to say that terrorism is inspired by Islam it's not hateful to say this crime in black neighborhoods it's not hateful to say that men and women are different it's simply the truth it's hateful not this it's hateful not to say it because keeping the truth from people simply makes them enraged over time I think what's what's strange that why I say this is a strangely beautiful moment is because it's like lancing a boil there's a lot of pain involved in this truth that has been hidden suddenly coming out and you notice it in this but in this very moment with this FB I think it's painful for me for you to see an organization I've worked with FBI people as a reporter they're usually incredibly competent incredibly talented people I feel deeply for the little guy Atlanta Atlanta Bureau who's busting some criminal who's now stained by what happened in the Obama administration this poil has to be lanced and i think that a lot of the pain that we're feeling a lot of the division we're feeling is is a good thing it's a it's letting this poison out this poison of silence this poison of lies that we have been surrounded by and people like us you know we only have our little corner to fight but we are saying what we mean we're saying what we think and that's a that was not happening 10 years ago and that's a that's an amazing thing it's a beautiful thing and I try to keep that in mind because I understand the divisions are painful and the exposure of the truth is painful but what we're going toward I think is actually a good thing we're honesty more truth and more simple reality I agree with all of that I think it's quite important to be especially going off what you've said Dennis it's important to be wise as a serpent and innocent as it dove the Democrats are innocent as serpents and wise as hell many times Republicans and they may have been wise as does they're all they're innocent as doves they haven't captured what reality is throwing at them and what we saw tonight in the speech what we saw in how Donald Trump played the Democrats and forced them into a corner is that I think this guy is wise as a serpent and I think he's innocent as a dove from this first year that we've seen from him in a in a very political sense and I think that's very encouraging I leave this number up for you using the word Innes it with regard to president stormy yeah I think everyone I agree largely with what everyone said I would add to your concern about Lansing the boil though drew that it's not only the truth being revealed that's painful but the process by which truth is currently being revealed is also painful I think for people like Ben and I in particular in this company that's been one of the the biggest challenges over the last year is that Trump is a blunt instrument and he's I don't think that he is necessarily motivated by the things that motivate the five of us the the philosophical things that motivate the five of us the values that motivate the five of us but by this weird moment of Providence he he is largely being used to advance the things that motivate us and I don't say being used so he's a puppet that's not what I mean to imply I think it's far more complicated than that I think for example that Donald Trump's history has been far more less than his presidency has been I think that if Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hadn't been reactionary partisans they probably could have made deals with him early in his presidency and he would have been happy to have signed deals that would have made many of the people who supported him on this couch very upset but strangely he is the man of this moment where their their inability to grab an advantage for partisan reasons created a framework in which Trump has operated as a great advocate of of our policy preferences what what concerns me from the speech obviously the same things that concern everyone here you know the talk about paid maternity leave talk about trillion-dollar infrastructure spending I'm worried about his tendencies towards less policy what gives me hope is the fact that the Democrats couldn't even come after those things I think that their if you'll excuse the term constitutionally incapable of making deals with him and that leaves us in a great position where we could we could see Larkin the most conservative year of governance that's what our lifetimes yeah yeah and and to the original question of this is never Trump a continuing phenomenon and and there's a continue if it is is it a major continuing phenomenon you know we'll we'll know the answer to that in three years because never Trump was fundamentally in an electoral consideration and I think it's fair to say that even many of us who dislike the president on a character level are gonna have a very hard time making some of the arguments that we were making in the last election when he was an unknown I didn't see any reason to be confident that he would advance our policy agenda the proof is in the pudding so far he really has it been star our policies and and that definitely has to change the calculations the other thing that changes the calculation even on the character side is that Trump has been the president and so if your fear was evident he doesn't have the if he if you say he doesn't have the character to be President well that's no longer no longer speculate about the damage or the benefit the benefit will be there and then you can make a call yeah that's exactly right so I think a lot of the things that have divided us as Republicans over the last 18 to 24 months I think we're gonna see the party consolidating more and more back to its old sort of framework not necessarily changing all of our opinions about Trump but changing our view of what Trump means in the moment in which we again thank you to everybody who who tuned in for the last four hours want to thank the guys we want to catch us you can come over to the daily wire com we'd
