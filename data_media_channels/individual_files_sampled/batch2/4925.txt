Steve Bannon is very polarizing plenty of people don't want to hear any more from him but Bob Miller's not one of them he did want to hear from Bannon today I was able to press C Bannon on why he told me he is a fact witness to both collusion and obstruction issues in this Russia Pro be told me a story we've never heard directly from Bannon on air before how he actually first met Bob Miller inside the Trump White House this was just days before Muller was named special counsel it was as Muller was walking into the Oval Office to meet with Donald Trump about the embattled FBI and we now know that was the last time that Bob Muller and Donald Trump spoke face to face I also press Steve Bannon about his standard for treasonous conduct at that Trump Tower meeting here are these key Russia highlights so when when when I basically laid out the facts of what I thought the Comey situation was if they if people decided to go in a different direction then it's not it's not my thing I'm not there to try to try to fight things to the very end so you advise against it walk us through the day he was fired the day he's fired I see it on TV like everybody else I mean I'm sitting in the chief of staff's office I'm working on something for rice that needs to be done I see it up on TV and what did you think I thought I said I thought it was a big mistake and I thought it would lead to a special counsel I mean I was pretty good I think everything I said the time basically worked itself out that was gonna lead to a special case I think if the Comey investigation have been allowed to continue would have taken a another couple of months in a wrapped up when is the first time during your White House service that you ever talked to Bob Muller well Bob Moeller came in you know in gave advice or was interviewed has been publicly reported for FBI director and you know Bob Mould I was sitting in a kind of the outer office and Moeller actually walks up to me and I've never been before my life I'm standing acting back of who picks at her computer terminal and we're talking about something he walks up and says he just shook hands said Steve I can't believe you know Moeller's a Marine he says Steve I can't believe somebody in the senior naval service allowed his daughter to matriculate at at West Point and I just laughed I told somebody laters pretty thorough guy to know that that's the first time I ever met him what was he trying to say to you I think he was just trying to I think he was trying to you know just introduce himself at that time it was he was actually there to give advice on the type of person that we should select the FBI director so this is pretty fascinating yours there working in the White House right out of five right Bob Miller walks and says this to you and then he what goes into the Oval yeah you say you're a witness of fact yep which is a good thing for you I think so you haven't been advised did you or something worse than their eyes we're you a witness of fact to the investigation regarding obstruction or collusion or both I think I'm a witness a fact for all of it I think I'm a witness of fact for all of it I mean they call you up there's not they don't really kind of bifurcate they kind of go to the whole thing and of course I've been to Capitol Hill right a couple of times so you know I'm a witness of fact up there also when you said the Trump Tower meeting with the Russians was treasonous and you said you meant Paul Manafort yeah what about it made it treasonous in your view I just look I think for a professional like Paul Manafort I don't think you ever have you know forget it just you know people from other countries Russians or whatever come in and try to get opposition research is enough for opposition research out there look Clinton cash to me did all the opposition research you had to do you just had to get down there and drill down on it and as we did when I took over the campaign on that Monday or when I was CEO of the campaign with Kelly Anna's campaign manager on that Monday the first day we kind of took over we put out a I think a statement from then candidate Trump it was about Paul Manafort when Manafort was I think getting ready to resign and we've referenced Clinton cash in her corruption in Clinton cash so you're by your standard it's that knowledge of the foreign offer of help well no I don't know the foreign offer of help I think it's even just trying to do something like that I think is trying to do something like that so it's all Trump knew about that then he was in on treasonous behavior in your standard no which hasn't been proven that he know anything about it we don't know anything but he's done know anything about it he's not he's denied nor anything zero chance Don junior didn't tell him and Michael Cohen reportedly says Trump knew about it well you have to take Michael Khan for Michael Cohen right you're just kind of to take you know you don't know what Mike Cowen's doing with federal authorities what deals he's cutting what he's trying to do with art if a camera knows about that in advance then are they part of treasonous behavior by your standard I think you have to call into question if somebody's actually out there trying to get information from foreign parties you have to you have to question that you so if Muller could prove that about Donald Trump that would concern you it would it would definitely concern me yes but the president's been pretty adamant they didn't know about it and has another benefit hey I'm all remember from
