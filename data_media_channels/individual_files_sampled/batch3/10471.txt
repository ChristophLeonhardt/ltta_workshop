she said she would but how benign arteries amaze policies in reality joining me now from Bordeaux in southwestern France journalist Vanessa Bailey she's recently been in Syria where she's been investigating UK government ties to what British mainstream media has for so long called moderate rebels Vanessa thanks for being on going underground just before we go to Syria what about to resume condemning the blockade of the ports in Yemen surely a sign of UK good intentions in the Middle East unfortunately I can't agree that the UK has any good intentions in the Middle East whatsoever they've been responsible in Yemen for maintaining the blockade through the UN Security Council resolution two two one six that has effectively used an illegitimate illegitimate basis for its resolution the legitimacy of the twice resigned president Hadi to maintain a blockade a humanitarian blockade against the Yemeni people and we know that the British government successive successively have been profiting from the military industrial complex trade with Saudi Arabia and are also determining targets in the rear'd command and control center so any fo pretensions of humanitarian interests in the Yemen fall very flat as far as I'm concerned I should say the government deny that they're involved in the targeting they're just involved in the training of those targeting let's go on just Syria them I mean you've done so much work I should say that we've often relied on some of your work because you mean in in Syria recently surely you're happy now that the state-mandated BBC is finally vindicated some of your work and said that the UK taxpayer is funding Islamist terrorists that basically can be linked to all the way back to Osama bin Laden and and the destruction of the Twin Towers that's who the British taxpayer funds and that's what the BBC's found I think it's very interesting that seven years into the conflict the BBC which up until now has been very clearly colluding with the British state narrative which is effectively to demonize those reinstate the Syrian leadership and the Syrian National Army the Syrian Arab army and its allies of course it's taken them seven years apparently to discover this link between UK foreign office funding and terrorist factions inside Syria when to be fair organizations like RT like Sputnik independent analysts and investigative journalists have been pointing this out for the last six years so it's let's say the BBC a rather late coming to the party here ABC deny of course any collusion and would accuse the outlets including this channel of just being pro-russian propaganda and and the fact the Procter key an Iran and and the Syrian government yeah of course what we've actually seen I believe in this BBC Panorama programme is effectively a controlled detonation a controlled media detonation they've reduced what is a mountain of evidence down to a molehill effectively they focused in on the Free Syrian police they've completely ignored the white helmets that I've been investigating for the last three years that run a very sir or a run by a very similar operation of UK foreign office funding via intermediaries both externally and on the ground in Syria and who work alongside the free serene police but not only the white helmets the local councils all of these entities these what I would call shadow state entities inside Syria are being funded by very similar processes as the Free Syrian police but the focus of the BBC Panorama programme was entirely on the Free Syrian police and of course on Adam Smith international that has a history of back-channel corruption profiteering from aid contracts which has been extensively documented by even mainstream media in the UK okay but what you said about the white helmets white helmets footage is still routinely used it was used on the night of that panorama program that we're talking about why are they protected by the mainstream media yeah I think the word you used is absolutely correct they are being protected and I honestly believe that this BBC I'm a program let's remember BBC panoramas history in Syria let's remember saving Syria's children and Robert Stewart's forensic analysis of that entire report and its potential to be nothing more than propaganda so I genuinely believe this BBC Panorama programme is to create a scapegoat which is the free syrian police adam smith international in this case while ignoring for me the much more important concept of the white helmet now if we compare the white helmet concept to for example the KLA which morphed into the kosovo security corps in Kosovo it's a very similar process we're seeing the British government colluding with al-qaeda affiliates inside Syria we're seeing running alongside those the white helmet organization which we know works hand-in-hand with nusra front and various other extremist entities inside Syria it acts as a human shield it acts as a protection for those terrorist entities it acts as a camouflage for the atrocities that they are committing against the Syrian people so I think we're not seeing a protection of the white helmets themselves per se inside Syria what we're seeing is the protection of the global concept we're seeing the white helmets appearing in Brazil in Venezuela in Malaysia in the Philippines so this is not a serious centric issue Russian this is a global issue they're protecting the concept they're protecting it to be fit for purpose for future military interventions what it's as if they learned from the 1980s version of their the death squads us jet squads are ghosts in that in Central America into what you seem to be suggesting is a whole new PR dimension - absolutely look if we look at the process if we look at what I believe the white helmets do first of all they infiltrated the country they built upon sectarian divisions that may or may not have exist they gained the trust I mean James Missouri a who's the ex-military British trainer of the white helmets has said very clearly the one entity that people will trust are the fire brigade or the first responders or the humanitarian organizations hence the creation of the white helmets in 2013 so we see them infiltrate but then we also see them being earmarked for reconstructing Syria after the conflict ends so securing British government carpetbagging rights inside Syria let's say and then this this entire process will be repeated sort of repeat spin cycle elsewhere in other global interventions and one thing that I wanted to make clear after in the talk has been about this this funding stream through Adam Smith international - the Free Syrian police but what has been completely ignored in this program is the two hundred and million that has gone from the con flexibility and security funds into the euphemistically called Syrian opposition and I received the actual breakdown off this two hundred million this is the conflict stability and security fund yes 18 million into peace building and track to operations 32 million to moderate armed groups now they're claiming it's non-lethal aid but how are they vetting these moderately armed groups or these moderate extremist groups safety security and stability now that of course includes the Free Syrian police and the white home it's 54 million they're making the claims that the white helmets have saved a hundred thousand lives where is the documentation and the accountability for this claim they're also claiming that they are helping partnering 7 million people inside Syria well that's over 35 percent of the population that remains inside Syria I would also challenge that claim then we go on to political support 14 million government livelihood an education in a country that Britain shouldn't really be involved in under international law 39 million strategic communications' 23 million which claims to empower the moderate voices now this again we know that funds have gone to an organization and NGO set up by X F co-employee corn Ross who was also involved in the Iraq conflict on this road exactly who set up independent diplomat we know through the farad declarations that a certain number of millions have gone through independent diplomat and we know independent diplomat have promoted the white helmets in 2016 and then human rights and accountability 20 million this is to develop independent media organizations for example bas Masuria that was set up by och consultancy who was also involved in the creation of the white helmet so you know when we look at the the extent and the complexity of this funding operation by the British government and the fact that if you put in a Freedom of Information request they claim of course plausible deniability that everything is being outsourced so they cannot provide information to back up the claims that they are making because it is all being outsourced which of course then gives them as we're saying now with BBC Panorama the plausible deniability in which they can back off and lay the blame onto Adam Smith international in this case we often cover austerity here issues here and you're talking about hundreds of millions of taxpayer pounds the question arises why on earth would the British government be making the British taxpayer fund people that are in effect linked to you know the the person responsible for the bombing of the Manchester arena or the Westminster bombing here what does Britain get out of funding people like that this 200 million has been sent to the Syrian opposition with very little ability apparently to vet where that money actually goes to and I proven in my articles that it goes to terrorist organizations or to terrorists run organizations such as the local councils in East Aleppo which again connected to Adam Smith funding via their Tom Kean project inside Syria so we see a repeat of the same process as with the free syrian police but through the local councils at the same time while we are giving millions to the white helmet we're making severe cutbacks to our own fire brigades for example our own National Health Service one of the reasons that granville was such a tragedy and this was a statement made by the Fire Brigades themselves was that because of various savage cutbacks they were unable to respond in the way that they should have been able to respond so this is an extraordinary situation where our own country is suffering from cutbacks from austerity from cutbacks in our own national health service and yet here we are pouring millions in Syria into the health and education into an organization like the white helmets which is questionable questionable as to whether it is a terrorist affiliated organization or not and as I said we've seen it previously in Kosovo and by the way James lemuria who was the trainer of the white helmet was also present in Kosovo we don't have coincidences here Vanessa Billy thank you
