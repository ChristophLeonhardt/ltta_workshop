>>> GOOD AFTERNOON WE'RE COMING 
BACK ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 
ADDRESS THE SERIES OF EXPLOSIVE 
DEVICES AND PACKAGES SENT TO 
PROMINENT PUBLIC OFFICIALS 
INCLUDING FORMER PRESIDENTS 
CLINTON AND OBAMA OVER THE LAST 
SEVERAL DAYS.
YOU SEE THE LIST THERE OF PUBLIC
OFFICIALS WHO RECEIVED THE 
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.
IT INCLUDES GEORGE SOROS, NEW 
YORK GOVERNOR, MAXINE WATERS, 
ERIC HOLDER, ALL WHO HAVE BEEN 
VERBAL TARGETS OR CRITICS OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS CALLED THESE
ACTS DISPICKABLE.
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS SPOKEN 
OUT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS RECEIVED A 
BRIEFING FROM THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY.
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> TO TALK ABOUT TODAY'S NEWS 
AND THE ATTEMPTED ATTACKS ON 
PRESIDENT CLINTON, PRESIDENT 
OBAMA, THEIR FAMILIES, PUBLIC 
OFFICIALS, INDIVIDUALS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS.
WE CANNOT TOLERATE THOSE 
COWARDLY ATTACKS.
I STRONGLY CONDEMN ALL THOSE WHO
CHOOSE VIOLENCE.
I'M GRATEFUL TO THE SECRET 
SERVICE AS WELL AS THE LOCAL AND
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ALL 
THEY DO ON A DAILY BASIS TO KEEP
US SAFE AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO CHOOSE 
KINDNESS OVER HATRED.
I WANT TO WELCOME YOU ALL ON THE
WHITE HOUSE TO REFLECT ON THE 
PROGRESS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS
MADE IN TACKLING THE OPOID 
CRISIS AND TO LOOK AHEAD AT THE 
WORK STILL NEEDED TO BE DONE.
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE 
ACTIONS WE'RE TAKING TO COMBAT 
THE OPOID EPIDEMIC WHICH MY 
HUSBAND WILL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW
MINUTES.
I'M PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT AND 
THE WORK BEING DOWN IN THE WHITE
HOUSE TO HELP THOSE AFFECTED BY 
DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION.
LAST WEEK I VISITED THOMAS 
JEFFERSON HOSPITAL TO LEARN 
ABOUT MATERNAL ADDICTION, 
TREATMENT AND RESEARCH PROGRAM 
CALLED MATTER.
THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS FAMILIES 
AND BABIES BORN WITH KNEO NATAL 
SYNDROME.
MY CAMPAIGN, BE BEST, IS 
COMMITTED TO HELPING CHILDREN 
WITH THE MANY ISSUES THEY FACE 
GROWING UP.
SADLY DRUG ABUSE IS ONE OF THOSE
ISSUES.
BE BEST WILL CONTINUE TO SHINE A
LIGHT ON SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS 
LIKE MATTER THAT DEMONSTRATE 
POSITIVE RESULTS FOR CHILDREN.
OVER THE PAST YEAR I HAVE 
TRAVELLED BOTH NATIONALLY AND 
INTERNATIONALLY LEARNING ABOUT 
MANY OF THE PROGRAMS OFFERED 
THROUGH PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, 
C
SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS WHICH ARE 
MEANT TO HELP CHILDREN AND 
FAMILIES AS THEY DEAL WITH DRUG 
ADDICTION.
WHAT I CONSTANTLY HEAR IS THE 
NEED FOR SUPPORT AT ALL LEVELS, 
LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS OUR 
SUPPORT AND THE RESOURCES 
NECESSARY TO STOP CRIMINALS FROM
PUTTING DRUGS ON THE STREETS.
FAMILIES NEED THE RESOURCES TO 
GET TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP CARE
FOR LOVED ONES.
THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED NEED THE 
SUPPORT, RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE 
TO KNOW THEY ARE FIGHTING A 
DISEASE AND SHOULD NOT BE 
ASHAMED.
YOUNG MOTHERS NEED THE SUPPORT 
NECESSARY TO NOT ONLY BEAT THEIR
ADDICTION, BUT TO HAVE THE TOOLS
NEEDED TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL 
PARENTS.
BABIES BORN ADDICTED NEED THE 
RESOURCES FOR TREATMENT, BUT 
ALSO NEED FOLLOW-UP CARE FOR 
YEARS TO COME.
I WAS HONORED TO BE PART OF A 
ROUND TABLE COMPRISED OF SEVERAL
EXPERTS AT THOMAS JEFFERSON 
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL THAT WAS 
CONVENED TO HELP WITH THE DESIGN
AND IMPLEMENTATION TO MEASURE 
THE LONG TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES 
AND NEEDS OF INFANTS.
AS A NATION WE MUST COME 
TOGETHER TO FIGHT THIS EPIDEMIC 
BY PROVIDING AS MANY RESOURCES 
AS POSSIBLE AND I KNOW THAT AS 
LONG AS MY HUSBAND IS IN OFFICE 
THIS WILL REMAIN A PRIORITY.
FIGHTING OPOID ABUSE GOES ACROSS
PARTY LINES.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR
BEING PART OF THE FIGHT TO END 
THIS EPIDEMIC.
IT'S NOW MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES.
>> THANK YOU.
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH, MELANIA, I KNOW HOW HARD 
YOU'VE WORKED ON THIS.
THAT'S JUST ONE OF MANY 
LANGUAGES YOU KNOW.
IT'S AMAZING THE WAY YOU CAN DO 
IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DARLING.
APPRECIATE IT.
I WANT TO THANK MRS. PENCE FOR 
BEING HERE.
YOU HAVE BEEN JUST SO TERRIFIC 
WORKING ALONGSIDE OUR GREAT VICE
PRESIDENT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN TODAY'S 
REMARKS BY PROVIDING AN UPDATE 
ON THE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES AND 
DEVICES MAILED TO CURRENT AND 
FORMER HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS.
THE SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE IS MY HIGHEST AND 
ABSOLUTE PRIORITY.
I HAVE JUST CONCLUDED A BRIEFING
WITH THE FBI, DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY AND THE U.S. SECRET 
SERVICE.
AS WE SPEAK THE PACKAGES ARE 
BEING INSPECTED BY TOP EXPLOSIVE
EXPERTS AND A MAJOR FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATION IS NOW UNDERWAY.
THE FULL WEIGHT OF OUR 
GOVERNMENT IS BEING DEPLOYED TO 
CONDUCT THIS INVESTIGATION AND 
BRING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THESE DESPICABLE ACTS TO 
JUSTICE.
WE WILL SPARE NO RESOURCES OR 
EXPENSE IN THIS EFFORT.
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT IN 
THESE TIMES WE HAVE TO UNIFY.
WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND 
SEND ONE VERY CLEAR, STRONG, 
UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE THAT ACTS 
OR THREATS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE
OF ANY KIND HAVE NO PLACE IN THE
UNITED STATES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT'S A VERY BIPARTISAN 
STATEMENT.
I CAN TELL YOU FROM BOTH SIDES 
WE BOTH AGREE ON THAT.
THIS EGREGIOUS CONDUCT IS 
ABHORRENT TO EVERYTHING WE HOLD 
DEAR AS AMERICANS.
MY ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL UPDATES AS THEY 
BECOME AVAILABLE.
I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY 
FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING.
WE ARE EXTREMELY ANGRY, UPSET, 
UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT WE WITNESSED 
THIS MORNING AND WE WILL GET TO 
THE BOTTOM OF IT.
WE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER 
TODAY -- 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CONDEMNING 
WHAT HE CALLED DESPICABLE ACTS, 
THE TARGETING OF SEVERAL 
PROMINENT OFFICIALS INCLUDING 
FORM PRESIDENTS OBAMA AND 
CLINTON.
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES WERE SENT TO
THE FORMER PACKAGES, MAXINE 
WATERS AND ERIC HOLDER.
WE WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE 
THOMAS FOR MORE.
PIERRE, WE KNOW THAT THREE OF 
THE DEVICES, ALSO THE ONE SENT 
TO CNN AND THE ONES TO THE 
FORMER PRESIDENTS, A LOT OF 
EXPLOSIVES. 
>> THIS IS WHY ALL THESE 
OFFICIALS ARE TAKING THIS SO 
SERIOUSLY.
IT'S WHY YOU HEARD SUCH A STRONG
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW VIABLE THE 
DEVICES WERE.
THEY CONTAINED EXPLOSIVE 
MATERIAL.
THAT FROM THE NYPD AND D.C. 
POLICE CHIEF WHO JUST SPOKE A 
FEW MOMENT AGO.
WHATEVER IT IS, THIS PERSON OR 
PEOPLE WHO ARE SENDING OUT THESE
PACKAGES HAVE ACCESS TO 
EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS AND IT'S 
BEING TREATED EXTREMELY 
SERIOUSLY. 
>> DO THEY ASSUME MORE ARE IN 
THE PIPELINE?
>> MY SOURCES WERE CONCERNED, 
WHEN WE LEARNED ABOUT THE 
CLINTON PACKAGE AND THE PACKAGE 
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA MORE COULD BE
IN THE PIPELINE.
OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS THEY'LL 
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT PACKAGES 
COMING INTO OTHER OFFICIALS.
>> LET ME BRING IN CECILIA VEGA.
THE PRESIDENT SAID THREATS OF 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAVE NO PLACE
IN THE UNITED STATES.
QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE 
SEEN ON THE STUMP. 
>> EXACTLY.
HE SAID WE HAVE TO UNIFY AND 
COME TOGETHER.
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE MOTIVE 
IS OR WHO THE SUSPECTS ARE.
THE TARGETS ARE -- THE COMMON 
THREAT IS ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE 
FRE
FREQUENT COMMENTERS OR CRITICS 
OF THE PRESIDENT.
MAXINE WATERS IS SOMEONE THE 
PRESIDENT CALLS LOW IQ.
CNN WAS THE POINT OF A CHANT, 
THE WHOLE ARENA WAS CHANTING CNN
SLURS.
WE WILL KEEP OUR EYES ON 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HE HEADS TO 
WISCONSIN FOR ANOTHER POLITICAL 
RALLY TO SEE IF HE TAMPS DOWN 
THIS TONE AT THE HEAT OF THE 
MIDTERM RACE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT DETERMINED TO 
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.
HE SAID THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE 
GOVERNMENT IS BEING DEPLOYED TO 
FIND OUT WHO IS BEHIND THE 
ATTACKS.
YOU CAN FOLLOW US ALL
