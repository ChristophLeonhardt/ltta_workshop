let's get to your charts let's look at the big picture here Steve Rattner what are you leading off with well let's go back to the house and it was obviously not a good night last night for the Republicans and I'm going to show you some data from other midterm elections that won't look any better for the Republicans than what we saw last night so let's start by looking at the last 13 or so midterm elections and what we did was plot the presidential approval on the vertical axis here against the number of House seats won or lost on the horizontal axis and then we drew a line using something called a regression analysis across them to basically find what is statistically most accurate and what you do find is about a 70% correlation between a president's approval rating and the number of House seats won or lost in a midterms so if you were at say 50 percent that would that would lead you to expect something like a 30 seat loss in the midterms however we have a president who is and we know is at 41 percent and so if we were to start at 41 percent and draw a line across you would find that it comes out around here in the about the 60 vote lost category you'll note that two red dots right above here represent our two most recent I guess what you would call wave elections in 1994 and 2010 both with presidents who had not even as low popularity as Donald Trump but somewhat low popularity and you could see that there were massive losses from both of those both those folks in the midterm the reminder Democrats only need 23 seats to flip the house exactly exactly so if you look at another another indicator of where the Republicans sit which is incumbents deciding not to run as you know there's something like an 85 percent reelect rate for incumbents so having an open seat certainly as an advantage for whichever party is contesting that seat and you can see again going back to 1976 the number of retirements both Democratic and Republican over that period of time you can see for example in the 1994 period there were a huge number of Democratic retirements and that presumably anticipated the wave election of that year but you can also see this year you're up to I think it's 41 at the moment Republican retirements and that is a historically high number for the Republicans historically number from both parties and a much lower number of Democratic retirements and so that also augurs well for Democrats trying to contest open seats in house that tends to go with the incumbent and then lastly there have been a thousand of prognosticators who tried to run simulations of what they think is going to happen this fall here's one by the economist which ran 10,000 simulations of various outcomes using both national variables and local variables and what they found was that by their math there's about a 71 percent chance of the house flipping to democratic by at least one vote they found that if you that there's a 50/50 proposition of about 40 of about a 14 seat majority for Democrats in the house which would be a swing of about 37 votes and so by their math there's almost say there's a 70% probability the house flipping there's close to 100 percent chance of Democrats getting more votes and a lot of this of course comes down to the built in edge for Republicans the way the gerrymandering has worked the way the districts are set up the economist thinks that there's about a three and a half percent edge for Republicans other numbers are as high as seven I've even seen 10 but all of this does not augur well for the Republicans yeah and no Robin you never know exactly what's going to happen in these races I remember 1998 while Bill Clinton was in the middle of impeachment many Democrats and Republicans were expecting a massive wave for the GOP they ended up I think picking up four seats and that led affected lead to the end of Newt Gingrich's speakership 2002 leading up to the Iraq war many were surprised that the Republicans actually picked up some seats in that off year election so sometimes their surprises it and it we could all be surprised this fall maybe the Republicans come out in massive numbers you're smiling I'm just I'm just saying anything is possible I'm not exactly sure what would do that and I was looking at a frank luntz tweet last night and he said a one-point victory in that district is nothing to celebrate talking about in Ohio 12 and he said the GOP will have to do something really significant in September if they want to keep the house what could that be what could Republicans do in September for the three days or however long back from their August recess before they leave for their September recess to actually hold on to the house it's tough to envision and nobody seems to have any interest in doing very much of anything in Congress it seems like the conservative movement to say nothing of the Republican Party it is pretty deflated I don't remember the last time I heard a conservative talk about a conservative idea they talked about how awful the the liberal ideas are how awful the social democratic policy platform is but I don't hear very much of alternatives and you would think that people would be defending for example the extent to which right-to-work legislation as we were talking about in the last break has spread across the Union and has demonstrated a capacity to liberate people from their from the the confines of a union to which they do not belong you would think you would hear people talking about the economy the extent to which that has demonstrated some capacity for growth for percent GDP growth is a pretty good number unemployment where it is at four percent is a pretty good number record low unemployment among minorities etc but you don't really hear that you hear a negative message the idea is that this will register register more with Republican voters fear is a better motivator than enthusiasm then then you know thankfulness towards the Republican Party but I just don't see it I don't see any of that manifesting in some sort of a victory in Donald Trump by leaning into these these primary victories demonstrating he's saying that he is responsible for these victories is politically tone-deaf it's silly he's gonna have to run away from a loss in November if they if Republicans do suffer and so he's just setting himself up as the key architect of the voters whatever the voters want to do in November whether they go to the polls for him there go to the polls for against him he's supposed to be preserving his mandate and he's not doing that he's running out right in front of this thing and saying this is all about me and that's gonna that's gonna backfire in November well in and know if there were any conservatives left in the Republican Party and I'm sure they're there but they don't seem to be answering polls when people ask about Vladimir Putin or they ask about you know protectionism but what conservatives left and the party would be energized to go out for the sort of things that got me and I'm sure you voted for candidates in the past or they small government conservatives I mean here you have Donald Trump running up the largest federal debt ever you've got Donald Trump promising the most tariffs taxes on middle-class and working-class Americans and ever before you have Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress passing the largest spending bill ever let me say that again Donald Trump and Republicans that dominate Congress pass the largest spending bill ever and the deficits exploding to over a trillion dollars a year and no those aren't Barack Obama's deficits you can look and see what donald trump's own government saying and trump's actions over the past year the past year and a half have added hundreds of billions of dollars to his deficits what small government conservatives going to get excited and say hey i'm gonna call all my friends at church and tell them to go with me to the voting booth and entitlement reform as we understand it the necessity of entitlement reform is just not on the table nobody seems to want to talk about it i understand it's an election year issue that's like you know putting your peas first on the table and saying eat up and then we'll get the ice cream later but nobody nobody's making this case and conservatives still care about that sort of thing I know there's mixed feelings about the tax bill here and I have as many mixed feelings about it as you do because of its the extent to which it just balloons the deficit but there is some value to it in the sense that it has put so much it's so much money into the economy so much liquidity into the economy that you can't have this kind of business activity that we've seen without that kind of boost that comes from anticipation that the corporate tax code for example is going to generate a lot of capital investment so make that case say that you know be less afraid of this tax bill this only major reform that this Congress has passed make that case well I and I understand that but mica the tax bill is deeply unpopular with the American people most Americans believe that that the benefits went to well actually there who Donald Trump said the benefits went to their friends the night after it passed he went to Mara Lago he sat around with his billionaire friends and he said I just made you all a lot of money with the tax cut that I passed so you've got that side of it it hurts Donald Trump the populist it hurts populist Republicans it looks like it's going to billionaires into CEOs and multinational corporations for stock buybacks and then on the other side of it you've got conservative thinking well gee it wasn't really targeted to stimulate the economy and it's just driven us deeper in debt so that's why and we could go over the numbers later with Steve Ratner but that's why even the one thing they did cutting taxes deeply unpopular with many Americans well on taxes and on immigration the president has has done things that I think hurt his positive brand with the people who were blindly following him I think those those two issues have problems that will stick with him still ahead we're learning new details about last month's summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin but it's coming from Moscow course it is of course plus Trump has been tweeting a lot about the Muller probe lately Senator Lindsey Graham says he's talking about it a lot too on the golf course we'll have that coming up next thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and
