the one person who has not so far been driven mad by him is Barack Obama the one person who is only now starting to make mistakes going after Donald Trump is Barack Obama why because Barack Obama is a troll he's an expert troll he's not only a great politician he was expert at driving the right insane he made us he knew exactly what to say to make us crazy and and to some degree I think it blew up on him because he lost all the seats all these seats all the state governments all this all the Democrats strongholds fell around him because he was so busy making us crazy but it did make the right make mistakes and so he understands what Trump is doing but just the other day I may have been yesterday he was at some economic conference and he started to compare Trump to Hitler I mean if this had been the other way around if so if if former President Bush had done this to Obama are you kidding me I mean the papers would have set the world on fire with this he says this is Obama speaking that's what happened in Germany in the 1930s we have to tend this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly the danger is in growing complacent that's what happened in Germany in the 1930s which despite the democracy of the Weimar Republic in centuries of high-level cultural and scientific achievements Adolf Hitler rose to dominate 60 million people died so you've got to pay attention and vote so he's basically saying Trump is Hitler our democracy is under attack which is gonna you know that that's Obama being trolled but I think there are two things one is Trump doesn't care he doesn't care about the status quo and everybody right and left is invested in the status quo they're they're not they're invested in the fight taking place the way the fight takes place they're invested in the sides being drawn the way the sides are drawn everybody is that's their profession whether it's you know the the commentators on the radio whether it's the New York Times whether it's the Democrats or the Republicans they are all invested in the status quo and he doesn't care about it he thought and it drives them nuts it makes them nuts and so they end up defending a status quo which when you think about it hasn't been going that well when you look at North Korea building its weapons not going so well when you look at the endless death and murder in the Middle East that is always putting Israel on the defensive not doing so well and and that is something that he he is like a revolutionary and it's making them crazy and and most importantly he is destroying the way we discuss things and the way reason that makes the left so mad is because they have controlled the way that we discuss things all this time that they've just decided what words are racist what attitudes are racist they've decided that whether an individual is racist matters I'm not sure it does they've decided what sexist they've decided all of these things and now because Trump will not he will not fall down when they say these things to him he is changing the status quo and I think so many people are invested in the way things are that I just think it drives them nuts plus he's a troll he knows exactly instinctively what will make them crazy
