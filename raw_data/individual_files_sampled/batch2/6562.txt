updates on the tragic shooting from yesterday that killed five people at the capital Gazette in Maryland new details that the assailant Jared Ramos used to be a federal employee with the Bureau of Labor Statistics but was let go in 2014 for quote security sustainability concerns and records show that he wasn't allowed to return to his building for security reasons his motive is not but yet been confirmed and here we have some sketches of him in the courtroom he was in court today and his bond was denied so he'll be detained until his court date his motive has also not yet been confirmed but it appears he had filed a defamation lawsuit against the paper for reporting on his harassment of a woman and subsequent criminal harassment charge in 2011 for which he played for which he was placed on 18 months of supervised probation and in spite of the charge police say that the weapon he used a pump-action shotgun was purchased legally so I mean that's again we have to change the gun laws in this country some more small details on the shooting including that Ramos barred the exit doors and according to the county police chief he quote was there to kill as many people as he could kill additionally it was reported yesterday that it was reported yesterday that he damaged his fingertips and did not carry ID to avoid identification but police were able to identify him in a few hours based on facial recognition software which I mean I hope it really hurt for him to burn his fingers and you know try to do that because it didn't work authorities are still investigating his background and the crime scene and will update as more details come on it as soon as I hear the facial recognition thing I think oh that's good and then I think yeah I guess I guess they should have something like that no I'm the one other thing I want to say really quick is that he he had been harassing this female journalist she reported him said that she thought he would become a mass shooter at some point and then he legally buys a shotgun so I just want you to bear that in mind in the future when you hear people say oh well they were there were legally obtained guns so we don't need any gun control yes they are legally obtained after there is significant fears that you were going murder a bunch of people so he literally have eagle in this time had a criminal charge yeah for I mean it seems like someone who's stalking and harassing a woman should not be able to buy a gun that seems like a terrible idea but here we yeah well unfortunately in a country littered with terrible ideas mainly from the right wing so yesterday I was obviously furious about the shooting and I guess people want people to be calm about shootings and no I'm not gonna be calm about it and I partly blamed Donald Trump we were very clear in the video that at the time we didn't know the motives of the shooter but that there were a couple issues that that Trump I think was responsible for one is he has done nothing about the nonstop massacres in this country constantly talks about it he alone can protect you he was supposed to be the big tough guy that brought you security where is it where's the security nowhere the massacres have not abated at all under Trump now some people online are like yeah but I mean look because but we're used to massacres in America other presidents had massacres - that's right and that's why we should stop it with the frickin guns in every single person's hand but you don't want to do that and Trump doesn't want to do that so Trump said he was gonna be a tough guy he was gonna hold the NRA countable did he know nothing he did nothing so you've got two choices one he is a coward and corrupt and serves NRA because they pay him - or he's totally incompetent and is never ever going to be able to keep you safe does it look like I'm apologizing no I am NOT I won't back down 1% yet Trump said he would keep people safe no he did not and he does it because he gets paid by the NRA so let me give you facts and are a spending the 2016 election cycle was fifty four million dollars fifty four million dollars almost all that going to Republicans the amount they spend directly on Trump was thirty point three million dollars well for that third email dollar bribe they get gun laws that say you can commit any Massacre you like and nobody's ever gonna do anything about it we're not gonna ban the bump stocks we're not gonna ban assault weapons we're not gonna do federal background checks because Donald Trump is corrupt and has already been bribed so he's not going to do anything you know and finally one more thing man one more stat NRA spending in the past 15 years on bribing politicians these are legal bribes but they are bribes bill moyers makes a great point if you go up to plate right before you're gonna swing you go to Empire oh here's a couple of thousand dollars no he's an honorable gentleman he won't that's not a bribe I'm just talking to I just think he should be continued to be an umpire yes so that's why I gave him money right no that's a bribe and when you give a politician a campaign donation or do independent expenditures those are bribes that's what they are everybody knows it so how much did they do in the last 15 years a hundred and thirty two million dollars worth of legalized bribes from the NRA to scummy politicians like Donald Trump and that's why the massacres continue including this one so you know you and I occasionally have arguments are strong but we disagree about the nature of calling all of those donations bribes although it would love to get money out of politics as you would because I sometimes have a tough time believing that a politician would risk his political future because he got ninety five hundred dollars from the telecommunications industry and a campaign where he raised two million dollars right now I mean you could argue that he would but I think but I think it's too low a number that you could sir it's certainly not provable it wouldn't hold up of court I don't think right thirty point three million dollars is a tough it's a tough sell that that doesn't influence your policy yeah it definitely influences also I mean just going by those numbers okay so you can take a look at that hundred and thirty two million dollars and say oh my god this is a lobby that spends a lot of money although of course other industries spend far more but focusing on the nra 132 million dollars over 15 years was it it was a good number of presidential elections fifty million of it more than one-third of everything they've spent in 15 years was on this cycle predominantly on Donald Trump they really thought they could get something good out of him they did they got non-stop massacres with nothing to check them and remember it those are helpful to the NRA and to gun manufacturers not just because hey people bought a gun and they used it good for sales but because it sends a panic across the country which leads to further gun sales well every Massacre leads to a spike in gun sales and you have to understand something this is like the people on TV sometimes driving me crazy they're like oh it sounds like a bit of a conspiracy theory that they'd want to make a profit yeah unfortunately their line of business makes a profit from creating something that kills things and those things include human beings and the more human beings that are killed the higher their profits so we've created an incentive for massacres and we've dead told our politician go ahead and take all their bribes and don't do anything about it so don't get surprised and is it the right wing's fault yes absolutely completely and then let me be further clear about this they say oh I criticize Donald Trump yesterday for attacking the media and then the newspaper gets attacked and and five people died so this guy seems to have a previous beef with this particular newspaper and Jules pointed out did he snap because now he died been going on for seven years seven years yeah did he then hear of Trump saying that the press is the enemy of the people and that's what put them over the top I don't know I'll grant you that speculation but uh but am I saying that's an that has nothing new with it well you have no evidence that that has nothing to do with it and it doesn't help when the President of the United States keeps telling people they are the enemy of the people what do you do with the enemy especially of a gun what do you do with the enemy okay so yes this is trump's fault and no i will not back down not even 1% from that same you know and the only the only hesitation that i have in wading into this argument is that it gives ammunition poor choice awards to the people on the other side who are going to argue that we can ever prove this points right we can never prove the the cause and effect I I don't need to prove the cause and effect because the President of the United States should never under any circumstances call the press the enemy of the people it was horrendous and a gargantuan failure and abdication responsibility before anything happened and of course I'm sure there will be more and will not be able to prove those either but the idea that the president United States thinks it's okay not just okay is emboldened to do it likes doing it knows that it fires up his people when you call the press people who are interested in seeking out the truth some do it better than others but that's the goal that you call them the enemy of the people that is what that's what dictators do that's what fascist right-wing administration's do and right-wing governments have done and communist left-wing governments have done for generations in addition to inciting this violence and saying that the pressure of the enmity of the people Trump also spoke today about the shooting during a speech about his tax bill with a clip of that journalists like all Americans should be free from the fear of being violently attacked while doing their job my government will not rest until we have done everything in our power to reduce violent crime and to protect innocent life no you have what they do there was how many massacres have there been parkland Vegas of the list goes on and on and on and on and on a southern Springs okay and so you seem like you're resting a lot you played a lot of golf since those massacres and you've done nothing nothing to address it nothing so spare me your thoughts and prayers and we're gonna work around the clock no you're gonna work around the clock getting more money from the NRA you corrupt swamp creature you thug you know you're going around calling people out any of the people now now you pretend you care about journalists you don't care about journalists it's this guy when a Maxine Waters said hey if you see people in restaurants etc you know call him out right and so they pretended that she said hit them but she never said attack them what she never says right all for violence or anything approaching buck and Trump threatened her over it that's right so then Trump's tweets watch out what you wish for Mex okay now could you imagine if Obama had said to a Republican politician female Republican politician watch out what you wish for you just might get it right in reference to violence do you think that Fox News might have called him a thug you think they might have called him a thug and so this guy aids and abets of violence non-stop he did it during the campaign in all of his rallies throw him out punch him in the face assault them I'll pay your legal bills so spare me your thoughts and prayers your your monster you aid and abet all of this so we were talking about immigration earlier and thankfully you know people are standing up to what's going on in the Trump administration 575 people mostly women were arrested they're protesting these zero-tolerance immigration policy including actress Susan Sarandon and representative Pramila jeyapaul I hope I said that right I'm from Seattle Washington and also joining the protest although not arrested was Senator Tammy Duckworth who just gave birth in April and brought her daughter to the protest her daughter was the rest of them well no neutral administrator right well that's not that crazy of a stretch also senators Jeff Merkley Edie Marky and Kirsten Gillibrand attended the protest speaking of Gillibrand who absolutely rules yesterday she became the first sitting US senator to call for ice to be apology to call for ice to be abolished so major kudos to her um here's what she had to say she's also got some positions that are even to the left of Bernie Sanders she wants to get rid of ice now what are you going to do with your party if you do come into a majority and you have a significant number or at least in influence of people who have that kind of a position well I agree with it I don't think ice today is working as intended you think you should get rid of the agency I believe that it has become a deportation force and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues and I think you should reimagine ice under a new agency with a very different mission and take those two missions out and so we believe that we should protect families that need our help and that is not what ice is doing today and that's why I believe you should get rid of it start over reimagine it the reaction shot of him was hilarious okay but the really important point here guys is progressives are winning so when Kirsten Gillibrand who started what a year and a half ago is a little bit of an establishment politician it is now out flanking Bernie Sanders on the left that means the memo is out to politicians in Washington go left go left the country is laughs your voters are left you can't go left enough keep going and of course the this week Alexandria Casa of Cortez wins and one of her planks was abolish ice so now all sorts of politicians going at yeah I made apologize yeah yeah abolish ice yeah that's what I meant and and if you mean it I mean look if you don't mean it you'll be found out but a Gillibrand rhetoric is a testament to just telling voters yeah I've grown I changed my mind right and I again I don't know whether it'll work and when she runs for president and I think she obviously we think she will of weather you know progressive voters will believe that it's a legitimate change of heart or with oath still see or is an establishment centrist Democrat but your best tactic is just to say yeah yeah those things I believed back then I was mistaken man I've listened to the people who support me and they have persuaded me that is the message that I'm not advocating for him but I that if he has any hope that's what cory booker just should do just say i have changed my mind i was wrong okay i believe that he's followed her in a few many of the issues he is he still hasn't done the thing where he says and i also want to say i want to take a tiny bit of credit I want to I want to pull of Jack I didn't I was right and I only bring it up to that I think it's so important like it's been a couple years now since I started talking about ice and how they need to change their name because part of the problem that with Isis she says they got to separate the missions right separated law enforcement of criminal justice from the immigration is that they've created this badass name right that makes them I guarantee you and I'm not kidding makes them feel badass oh look at us work ice agents we're going to get it done and part of this means when they talk about changing the mission it's to that point which is no this is you're gonna become and we're gonna have an agency that deals with immigration issues and not a police force involved in that those are separate issues and that means doing away with the name ice yet you process asylum that's right that's what you do you are a bureaucrat you are not SWAT basic nobody on the left doesn't think immigration is an issue that requires a government agent see that is a you know adept and adroit and competent and able to handle it and this mission is being it they have misrepresented their mission and they've turned it into a police force which is the wrong wrong wrong idea I want to agree with Jake about that this is obviously another example where in the same way that so many of them have been dogpiling on getting rid of corporate pac money we're obviously progressives are winning and I understand we've been we've been beaten down for so long that nobody wants to buy it that's one find you don't to buy anything I don't know what that would mean maybe maybe she doesn't actually mean it maybe she'll reverse on it but it even if in a year and a half she doesn't feel the same way it's significant that she's calling for it now because there is momentum on this issue it was not long ago that there was literally there was one politician who was called when elected a Democrat was calling for ice to be abolished that was privileged I appalled arrested at yesterday's protest we had around the damage report today to talk about why ice needs to be taken out she says obviously it's gone far beyond its original mission we're spending ridiculous hundreds of millions billions of dollars on it it's a rogue agency with no effective means of actually controlling it so she did that she was the first congresswoman now we've got Kirsten Gillibrand the first senator something like like nine other representatives I think have signed on most of them since Tuesday by the way we just found out during the break that Nydia Velazquez another democratic congresswoman has signed on this is amazing progress inside just a week and we should acknowledge briefly although it is not purely female there are a big mark Pocan I think his name is he sponsored a bill to actually abolish it it's been led both of the house and in the Senate and amongst candidates like Alexandria Castillo Cortez by Democrats and I'm glad that they're there both they're speaking out they're also protesting they're putting they're putting their bodies on the line as well on Saturday is gonna be a lot more of these protests find out where it is in your area by the way one of the ways that you find out and track them is go to facebook.com slash rebel HQ that's where we cover these protests and we cover them from different cities John will cover it in a Los Angeles but we will have cameras and many of those protests on Saturday so go to facebook.com slash rebel HQ now Ben said I'll pull a chanc well I'll so I'll tell you that because nobody if you don't nobody ever gives credit is certainly not the progressives and so it's the Justice Democrats we said no corporate PAC money and now all of a sudden oh not everybody but a lot of people are saying corporate PAC money and I remember you remember you watch it you saw it all unfold right we said no corporate PAC money everybody said we were crazy now we got all these senators saying no corporate PAC money then when some of the just democratic candidates and they were the first like Alexandra Castillo Cortez she led on that absolutely she led within the Justice Democrats on that issue oh that's crazy now all of a sudden senators like Gillibrand by the way you know who else suggests Democrat primal Achaia Paul so she was the one arrested in these protests and she's been a super progressive no corporate back money super progressive leaders this is a real caucus now and these are the leaders of the progressive movement politically damaging now it could be politically damaging and in many races it will be if you take it like that'll be a question reporters ask people we expect to be running in 2020 I mean they've they've already like they're not waiting even until the primary for it they want to get that far ahead of it right to demonstrate that they actually mean it and again doesn't mean you have to trust them like I said before I don't even know what trusting them would actually accomplish an ism but they are not taking it you can now track that over time and guys after Ocasio Cortes won all the press said oh my god we missed it we didn't know there was almost no cameras there except the Young Turks in New York one had cameras in our headquarters and what in the world happened but what's great about oh you know I say we're not the Young Turks you are right you guys gave money to Alexandra crosshair Cortez and other wonderful progressive candidates than just Democrats this Center you made that race as possible you made these positions possible you made them popular and when they were surprised you weren't because we'd already done 34 videos on Alexandria cos of Cortez before election so while the rest of the country was shocked you're the ones who led that so thank you as always on that and we're just getting started I told you on the night of 2016 election you don't get sad you get angry you get back up and you fight and we're gonna win and I said 2018 was gonna be the beginning and here we are and it has begun and wait till you get the rest of 2018 and then the rest of 2020 but we are going to be a Centon we just got to keep going and I'm super proud that this is the home of progressives I'm super proud of our members TYT calm slice join to become a member and power this we are your media I don't know that a lot of this happens without at least some media outlet right and and I'm super proud of all of these justice Democrats that are leading the way for progressives police brutality stories continue to trickle in and one story that really caught my attention luckily did not lead to the death of anyone but it did feature a police officer who's now being investigated for using excessive force on a man who seemed to be listening to him and complying with all his demands now this story takes place in Pennsylvania apparently a neighbor recorded a Lancaster police officer using a stun gun on a 27 year-old man named Sean Williams Williams had been accused of using a baseball bat to assault someone but the people interviewed at the scene said they never saw the bat and police never recovered 100 in other words he didn't yeah so look those are the details we have of why the cops were there in the first place but regardless of why the cops were there what you're about to see it should in fury at you because you're about to witness a man complying with the cops and then you know dealing with the kind of treatment that he did so it's difficult to watch with but with that said take a look that's it like straight out straight up straight down come on on your stomach warm sound like an airplane okay so I don't know if everyone can hear it clearly but there's a female officer who's not on camera and I keep hearing straight out and crossed she's right she said she the guy said straight out which he clearly meant now in hindsight what he could have said don't bend your knees he meant put them out and then she wanted them out and cross ice that he had them out sort of just on the ground obviously I would say unthreatening and then he crossed them in an answer to her command and that was when the other when the male cop used the Taser but look I'm gonna be honest if I were in his situation I wouldn't know exactly what the cops want and honestly I would also be terrified because you know one wrong move and you could lose your life and from other videos that we've seen so he didn't look I think the most important thing is he wasn't in any type of position that posed a threat to anyone his back was turned to that male cop he was sitting on the curb you can clearly see his arms I I feel like there was really no need to tase him at that point but the police department is standing by and of course there was no need to taste it but obviously there's no need I get it they wanted his legs spread out if your legs I'm gonna I'm guessing now but I'm presume that if your legs are bent and your and the bottoms of your feet are on the ground you can spring up very quickly if your legs are extended out getting up is gonna take a longer time you were so that's why he was asking but then you have to say hey don't bend your knees legs straight out yell it whatever but he wanted to tase it he the second time that he said legs straight out and the guy just clearly didn't seem to get it he didn't he said aren't you gonna get tased you see him reaching and take out the Taser like he was like ready son meant the next time you don't obey me which came about with the confusing order from the female officer he went ahead and tased him it's ridiculous those guys aren't fit to be cops they should be fired they don't go to jail but they got no business having guns that was confusing I had no idea that they meant stick out your legs and cross them I mean experts at be listening to the cops wonder arrests for having a bat that we didn't have it and what they said in here is that they were using the Taser as a preventative measure yeah that's too much let me give you the statement from the Lancaster PD from Pennsylvania the statement that they gave to the press was this is done as a measure of control to ensure that if someone is going to flee or offer physical resistance they will have to move their legs under them to do so non-compliance is often a precursor to someone that is preparing to flee or fight with officers okay that's I'm so I'm correct I hadn't even read that yet but so if your legs are out like this you got to go like this first to get up your legs like this you can just spring straight up and that's what they're trying to avoid so make that effing clear before you use your taser yeah okay so I have a harsh review this and you guys have been harsh but not enough in my opinion so the cops now we've seen this in a lot of tapes play Simon Says with these guys and they're toying with people's lives and how the hell is he supposed to know I assume cross your legs man when she said it cross her legs like this like when you mention that he was in right so they can't wait to use the Taser it would appear that I don't read they we have this evidence we ice guys seemed eager to use the Taser and and look you could say look there's hundreds of thousands of cops across the country so the dozens and dozens and dozens maybe hundreds of videos we've seen where the cops can't wait to use their weapons is an anomaly but and most of them don't but then all the other cops defend them so but I likey Anna said I was terrified they were gonna murder because it reminded me of the story from Mesa Arizona of the guy crawling in the hallway of the hotel room and they keep giving him confusing instructions and he's in a panic and he's tried to comply and it's super obvious he's trying to comply in that case it was a white guy and then he just murdered him he you know for following his sobbing he has a guy sobbing really not a threat no nowhere near a threat and a guy shot him and killed him right and of course got away with it oh they're just bad apples if they're bad apples they in prison right now because you protect them because you and you encourage him to use too much violence and that's the problem with the training that I keep talking about in this case anybody watching that video if you're an honest person if you're a douche right winger you're like I get it I get it you're irredeemable right but if you're an honest person did he seem like a threat to you really like he didn't appear that he was trying to not listen to the cops or listen to the cops anybody looking at that tape looks like he's like okay I'm I'm trying to extend my legs then she says crossed amigos to try to cross them and he tasers are hate ace ISM anyway also if that's not a threat it's not a threat and by the way this preventative measure that's that's another quote the one that Kim reference that the cops used that means hey I'm going to assault you before you do anything I'm going to prevent you doing something that you didn't yet do and I'm going to taste something before you do it I think implicit in it also you're right is also I didn't shoot you pretended I presented myself shooting you yeah well congratulations I didn't murder you you know look nobody would be seeing this video if that cop had acted like an ass and told him to or even kicked his leg forward right we wouldn't be doing this story like kicked out the heel the like spread it out use the phrase knees straight that's it and would have done it right that's really what you wanted but you didn't have the skills to do it so yeah of course this guy was eager to and of course those directions were confusing that seems blatantly obvious that this guy wasn't a threat and it's by the way then the other thing that is I think always relevant here is okay I suppose the attitude that the cop is gonna portray that the cop is gonna say and with the department's history backing up is that he wasn't totally in it he was being like fine you're gonna make me sit down now and they're gonna make me sit here and spread my legs I don't quite know what you mean he was not yes suring it to the utmost extent right he was not a 150 percent complier he was at 84% and he was pissed right doesn't matter he's not a threat you don't get to win this your win is he did what you said you make sure he's not violent you if you're gonna arrest him you cuff him you put him in the car and you take him to the station and the process begins and that's it you don't get to tell you somebody because they pissed you off so there was a story that I believe we I believe it made it to the show maybe we didn't get to it because we ran out of time but there was a story about a woman in North Carolina who got arrested at a Publix at a public pool because she was harassing two boys black boys that she didn't want there she kept telling them you don't belong here and so they're kids they're two black boys one of them starts filming as she's forcing them out like following them to the exit and she assaults them on three different occasions you see the phone fall to the ground right and I guess at one point she strikes one of the kids in the face and cops are called when the cops showed up she started physically assaulting the cops apparently bit one of the cops in the ear and the cops you know arrest her she she gets her mugshot taken and everything I want everyone to be treated that way though that way right I get it she was incredibly combative she was incredibly difficult to deal with but I would not want anyone to pull a gun on her I would not want anyone to use excessive force on her arrest her book her let the justice system deal with her Jared Ramos didn't get tased he was under the desk with a gun yeah that's the guy who did the shooting it in Baltimore just now look now let me be less harsh it's not the particular cop and and a lot of people disagree with me when I say that but they trained them to be overwhelming force don't take any risks well if you're in a shootout like in the movie heat with bunch of bank robbers with automatic weapons then use overwhelming force but if a guy is sitting down and trying to comply with the orders don't use overwhelming force but what are they trained them to do unless it's a rich white woman make sure that you beat the crap out of them or tase them or shoot them don't take any chances because your life is more important than their life and also and they're protected you know I mean this needs to be a again as always a change in the law because we the issue is so much the DA's won't prosecute because we see what happens frequently when DA's prosecute they get acquitted because the laws are written or such a way where if you go my life was threatened and the law says if the cop feels like his life was threatened well then then lethal force is okay so if that law has changed to where that is no longer the only defense well then we'd have a different set of circumstances and I am you know probably I don't know whether I'm different than anybody else on this panel right I am enormous ly sympathetic to police officers in general it is an unbelievably stressful and difficult job and it's why they ought to get paid more and they ought to get trained better and and as a result when good cops of which there are many see this to Jenks point earlier they ought to say that guys a bad police officer and that guy makes my job harder instead what do they do and so this injustice to this guy has already happened okay but the injustice continues they arrested him well because they want to go investigate the guy swinging the bat and hitting people that's a really serious crime so I'm glad ou know they didn't arrest him on that cuz there was no bad they arrested him for public drunkenness you know what that is cover my ass I hate them he was the wrong guy and he wasn't doing anything wrong but I'll add insult to injury literally in this case by arresting him for public drunkenness so that I'm not embarrassed by the way that to me makes it worse if this guy is drunk yeah and you know he's drunk well then he's gonna have a difficult time following his demands and it also means he's less likely to be a threat to me and let me ask you guys no matter who you are against sometimes I talk to the right-wing because they I don't know if anything ever gets through their head but have you ever been drunk in public I have um I guess as all of you have drunk right now and and seriously and when you're going to bars you're going to clubs to say you've been drunk in public you think it's okay for a cop to go okay Simon Says this Simon Says that you didn't follow a tase tase tase right no and then you think that they charged him because they were really concerned afterwards that he was intoxicated no you know it everybody knows it they did it to cover their ass yeah what's a bigger crime here chasing that guy or being drunk in public come on I mean a lot of people unfortunately in the country would say being in public well knowing full well that they themselves have been drunk in public numerous times and that's that that's the unfortunate thing it's it's the lack of empathy the the lack of understanding and and I just wish people would put themselves in that person's shoes and understand what it's like to go through something like that and and not know clearly what the cops want you to do and then be met with that kind of you know physical force hey am more training better it's a frustrating story I feel like I could I could use a shot of a little dog tried to give CPR to ensue do we have a video of a dog that would help I just and it's a random thing to ask for there you guys go again with the dog the situation poncho he's not that good that'll never work he's not that good I feel like Jake and I are cat people I'm a person person I'm a well-known humanist I turn my phone of you holding a kitten like a baby okay every once in a while I dropped it off police in the state of Pennsylvania are using a hate crime law in order to trump up charges against minorities who say things that offend the cops now this has happened on several occasions and it was done through an investigation by an organization known as appeal they found that in 2016 alone there are at least four cases where individuals had their charges increased because of this hate crime law and it was simply because they had offended the cops so I'll give you one of the examples lease in Pennsylvania are using the state's hate crimes statute called ethnic intimidation defined as malicious intention toward the race color religion or national origin of another individual or group of individuals against people who direct vitriol at them right so Robbie Sanderson a black man is one of those people he's 52 years old he's from North Carolina but was in Pennsylvania at the time he was arrested for a retail theft in Crafton a small town near Pittsburgh now while he was getting arrested he started calling the cops all sorts of names he referred to them as Nazis skinheads and Gestapo he also told one of the officers according to the officer by the way Brian Tully that he was going to find his wife and have sex with her that's funny there's no way that's not funny did you phrase it like that I am going to find her wife and have sex with her okay the cops got very upset about it okay and so they decided to use this you know Pennsylvania hate crime law to allege that he was committing a hate crime although the shoplifting had nothing to do with any type of racial bias or or you know bigotry or anything like that so ethnic intimidation increases the penalty for a crime by making the grading one step higher than the underlying alleged bias-motivated offense right so let's say in this case your charge is shoplifting if it's a misdemeanor they'll up the charge to something more serious if they accuse you of a hate crime they are using laws that were meant to protect minorities to further you know criminalize minorities of course and by the way this is one of the reasons why I was against these hate crimes and so look I we've had that debate a million times on the show and I get the reasons why to do it but once you start criminalizing some forms of speech first of all the powerful are gonna use it against you and and that was one of my concerns and here we are now it's a hate crime to say things against cops this is not a thing like the tops are a profession they're not a protected class they're not a type of person apparently a job unless apparently in Pennsylvania being a giant snowflake is a protected class so what you shall be the worst thing used word Nazi skinhead and Gestapo they weren't saying anything about like this is your race you know I'm tired of this I am this is not the spirit of the law yeah it probably hurt their feelings they felt like they were being jerks but that's no reason to escalate a criminal offense the toughest guys out there you're putting your life at risk every day going out there protecting people you're gonna get your feelings hurt by some dude that you're arresting who's saying that he's gonna have sex with your wife like I get it it's offensive but like let's move on he's not actually gonna have sex with your wife shut the F up Robbie that's what you say and then you say really gonna have sex with my wife from prison I doubt it because that's where you're spending the night and then you leave them in the car for three minutes or just put them in Tristan no I'm saying like there's all kinds of way I get it you get to interact with him no one who says you have to be super nice to everybody you just say you can't tase him you can't hit him and you can't charge him with a hate crime that's designed for something completely else just show I'm you know I'm with Jack I don't like hate crime legislation I don't think we when somebody beats up a Jewish kid because he's Jewish you charge him with with the full force of the law for that assault that's enough uh I think it is a dangerous slope to get into what people are thinking at the time they commit this offense to make it more of a crime also how far will will this go right so if everyone looks the other way and and kind of allows the cops to increase charges or or give people additional charges with hate crime laws so if you're protesting the behavior of your local police department can they charge you with a hate crime so let's say that some agitator shows up and causes trouble and a bunch of people get arrested are you gonna be charged with a hate crime in the state of Pennsylvania if they decide that they're going to refer to this sounds like if that people what was the name of the town Grafton Grafton yeah if you do the the the tender easily hurt feelings of the police officers in Grafton yeah it sounds like you could be if you if they find one thing to charge you with but like something like it was an you didn't have the permit for the protest so they charge you with that and then they raised at a level because you used the phrase Gestapo to protest the police I mean obviously the ACLU says it's obviously an infringement on for you yeah the ACLU said is essentially pushing people to punishing people for disrespecting police officers which I've told you is not a crime anywhere in the country but is in reality the biggest crime in America because if you disrespect the police officers they're gonna find a way to charge you and not only that now they're gonna use hate crimes to double charge you and the absurdity of this applying it to professions is insanity so if you're at Occupy Wall Street and or you're part of the tea party you're protesting the wall street crimes and the bailouts and you say those are robber barons oh that was hateful you use the word robber okay that's a hate crime against Wall Street off you go to prison I mean this is crazy and I can get it for the people who are in favor of hate crimes they say intent is part of other crimes as well and that's why they think that it makes sense we were worried that the powerful would use it and they ad against the powerless they are now and and look it's so and there's absurd ones and there's ones that makes sense but even those are now perverted so let me explain two more examples real quick one guy called a cop a Gandhi mother-effer I don't know if the cop was Indian or if the cop was overly peaceful I don't know what the intent of that curse was maybe maybe the cop is is actually quite violent and it was offensive to call him peaceful okay no I don't know we had some other relationship Mohandas could have been Indira and and and one woman presumably a might already said death to all you white bitches by the way that was a woman who had called to report a crime and got increasingly frustrated that the you know the cops weren't like hearing her out or something and so they weren't even investigating her for committing a crime she's the one who called the cops now with that said yeah don't don't say disrespectful things I guess but even so even if you do it's not a crime it's not a crime inappropriate to a police officer it's not a crime yes unless you're like flashing inappropriate words a police officer right it's look that's the one that comes closest if you actually believe in hate speech etc but the point was to protect minorities who are powerless it's not it wasn't like and if there was a jurisdiction where life people are incredibly powerful and they're beating up on white people then it would protect white people right but not cops who are very were really really well protected and their feelings so I thought the right wing didn't was or interested in facts and not feelings but come to find out apparently not Politico magazine delved into the incredibly important issue of Trump staffers and their dating lives and they found that these staffers are actually having a very difficult time convincing people to sleep with them it's really a tragedy so let's dive into the details unlike previous administrations where staffers mixed in the buzzing areas of the city many Trump staffers now mix largely with each other and enjoy the view from their rooftop pools are they gonna be okay oh no it's not all you have the rooftop pool okay so let me give my one young Trump staffer admits she got into very very frequent bus stops with matches on dating apps and was asked questions such as how could you be such a racist and a bigot and do you rip babies from their mothers and send them to Mexico so well as part of the Trump administration the second question is in arguable yes you do so the bar filled areas that apparently people used to hang out at like in previous administrations don't usually have Trump people so Columbia Heights Shaw u Street H Street now they're full of anti Trump t-shirts and street art so they know street art fans are painting the streets it's amazing that those are the nails growing up in Washington that those are the neighborhoods named like when I was growing up nobody want any of those boys oh really yes good well okay so are you guys gonna be okay so one I guess pretty clever Trump staffer realized that all he needs to do is lie about what he does but he needs to find a profession where people would not want to ask more questions here's what the anonymous Trump staffer said I told people I was an auditor down on Wall Street and people just stopped asking me questions after that that guy's the smartest person a big mystery almost as if aligning yourself with an outspoken bigot who was cruel transparently in it for himself and doing terrible things and competently reflects poorly on you oh my god and I like that that we're here on Wall Street is like way better than working for the trumpet missus like oh you were and I can live with it laughs and I like that a guy who works for Trump figured out the answer is to lie more but also in a bit of a genius not just Wall Street an auditor on Wall Street no one ever asked another question after you say you're an auditor you
