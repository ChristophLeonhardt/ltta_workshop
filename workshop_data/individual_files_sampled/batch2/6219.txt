over the weekend the New York Times broke a story about Trump's defense team and how they had sent a memo to Special Counsel robert muller and federal prosecutors indicating that trump can't face any type of penalty or prosecution for obstruction of justice because he's the president he can't obstruct justice well interestingly enough Judge Andrew Napolitano was on Fox News and he toured that argument apart he tore other elements of this defense team apart as well and it is fantastic so without further ado let's take a look at the first video I think that the letter was a disgrace and and and harmful January January the January memo I don't know how it got out I don't know why the White House would have leaked it as has been suggested because it shows a really a sophomoric view of the law they cited the wrong statute and they interpreted the wrong the wrong opinion they interpreted a an appeals court opinion rather than the Supreme Court damn I don't know if the judge told the Fox News crew that he was bringing his elbow with him and that it was gonna be floating above their heads Napolitano all right tell us about the great Trump theories he's like wait hold on look I've said it before I'll say it again about Napolitano a lot of credit to him he's still super right wing and he saw tax Clinton and the Democrats and there's all that stuff and so don't get mistaken that guy is nobody's liberal okay at least he has principled but he does he look you give the devil his dude the guy's got principles he's like this is dumb this is not true that is not what the law says so in that first clip he did mention one of the major mistakes in that memo which was the team the team of lawyers mentioning or referencing the wrong statute but in the next clip he gets even more specific and lists off a bunch of other mistakes that they made which is fantastic take a look basically saying two things the president can't commit obstruction of justice because he's gonna order anybody prosecuted he can stop any prosecution he can fire anybody wants he can but if he does so for a corrupt purpose that would be the definition of obstruction of justice they forgot that part second argument they make is that he can interfere with an FBI investigation that's not obstruction of justice they forgot that the statute they said it was amended in 2002 you know 16 years ago to say that in the interference with an FBI investigation intended to produce evidences of the United States I mean you would think that he would have a really good legal team he doesn't have the kosumi recruitment now he has Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow so look he cited exactly the right laws in regarding to 2002 law and it's hilarious that they left out the part that was about obstruction of justice which is exactly this case right it's pretty convenient but look I'm gonna have respect for Napolitano for a long time from here on out and we can disagree on a hundred other policy issues but whether you're honest is the most important thing if you're honest that we're having an honest conversation conservative progressive we disagree that's great that's called America right the problem is the dishonest guys who backed Trump no matter what no matter how wrong he is on the law and Napolitano just won't do it I know and he's really risking the possibility of being nominated for the Supreme Court by criticizing when asked once said that he really early on in his campaign who are you nominating he said Judge Napolitano because it's literally the only judge he knows cuz that's what he watches TV right so that's out that's gone he's never gonna get that and so knowing that Trump is dumb enough to do something like that he still is criticizing him but only on the issues where he thinks he's wrong he backs Trump on policy he attacks Democrats all the time nothing wrong with that as long as you're actually principled now the more recent hire to Trump's legal team was Rudy Giuliani Rudy Giuliani happens to be friends with Judge Napolitano but in this next clip he attacks him and and Rudy Giuliani who was a pardon himself correct a brilliant prosecutor suggesting that the president could have ordered James Comey to be shot in the Oval Office and that he could not be prosecuted for that that is absurd and as a violation of all he could be arrested charged indicted released tried after he leaves the White House but no way would any law enforcement agency allow a murder or an attempted murder to go uncharged because the person behind it was the president so you can run and tell that so it's also very important that Napolitano is doing this on Fox News because if you're an MSNBC bubble you're gonna just Russia Russia Russia whatever else they're doing right if you're in the Fox News bubble most of the time 90% of the time 99% of the time you think the world is all roses and rainbows and unicorns now and when this guy comes to the bubble goes no no your dear leader is lying that's not true they're like wait a minute you just interrupted my dream yeah and so it gets them midweek I I trust Napolitano I trust Fox News I guess I'm thinking a little bit that's a great point I didn't think about that because I don't really ever rely on them to think but but if they hear from someone like Napolitano there's a possibility there but I think the way that people would at least Trump supporters would interpret all of this would be Oh Trump's got a hire new lawyers which could be exactly yeah and so I wanted to say the one part that I really disagree with him on though is that it's not the lawyers Giuliani is apparently lost his mind but the reason why I say it's not the lawyers it's Trump is telling them to do this Trump is telling them yeah go out there and say I could shoot somebody and get away with it that's got Trump written all over it and I can see Giuliani being like yes sir yeah mm-hmm all right I will no problem and then later when he gets in trouble he's a Rudy why'd you say that why do you think several attorneys have already left Trump's legal team he's impossible to work with an attorney on a career-making case defending the president leaves because he can't handle it anymore that is unprecedented it's because the guy in charge is a total buffoon two easy ways for Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below
