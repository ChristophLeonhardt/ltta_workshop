00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,800
Costume designer Ruth E.
Carter has made her career

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,970
showcasing black history
and culture onscreen.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,240
But with her latest
movie, “Black Panther,” she’s

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,900
looking to an African future.

5
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,430
In the film, the fictional
country of Wakanda

6
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,370
is derided as a third-world
backwater by outsiders,

7
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,140
but it’s actually a secretly
advanced, high-tech society.

8
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,690
Although it looks futuristic,
elements of African history

9
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,850
can be seen everywhere.

10
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,880
Carter got inspiration from the Turkana

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,250
and Maasai cultures
when designing the outfits

12
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,630
for the Dora Milaje,

13
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,380
a group of female warriors led
by Danai Gurira as Okoye.

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,560
Carter used this African mask as the
basis for a battle costume worn

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,790
by Winston Duke as M’Baku,

16
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,390
and her designs for
Lupita Nyong’o’s

17
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,940
character, Nakia,
are partially influenced

18
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,900
by the Surma populations of Ethiopia.

19
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,050
“The thing about Ruth 
is that she’s very understated.

20
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,790
She doesn’t lead with
all her experience.

21
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,790
She just leads with
a curiosity for the thing

22
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,130
she’s doing
right there and then.”

23
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,097
“Ruth would bring me in

24
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,680
and she would have,
like, a vision board

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,570
of, like, different inspirations.

26
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,100
And she would really fit—

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,973
She would really fit clothes
to myself,

28
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:08,769
And she would bring different
colors

29
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,000
and different flavors
to it.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,350
And Shuri’s, like,
love and light,

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,970
and it was really, like, bright,

32
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,730
maybe all white, or maybe orange,
or anything that can really

33
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,256
bring out her personality.”

34
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,130
“She has everything you
want in a collaborator.

35
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,600
She’s experienced, but,

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,130
you know, she’s still
youthful and energetic,

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,400
still curious and open
to trying new things.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,170
“Black Panther” broke
multiple box office records

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,790
the world over
during its opening weekend,

40
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,270
easily becoming the top-grossing
film of all time

41
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,620
by a black director

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,110
and featuring a
largely black cast.

43
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,050
And with that, Ruth Carter’s
costumes now also have

44
00:02:43,050 --> 00:00:00,000
a place in the history books.
