ada stumbling-block during the coalition talks has been migration policy with a number of new approaches being tried out to ease the crisis the eastern city of Cottbus has taken matters into its own hands and banned newcomers altogether the move is in response to several recent incidents last week a teenager was stabbed by two Syrians several days before that an elderly German couple was attacked by a group of refugees however local neo-nazis have also been blamed for violence at illegal rallies with reports they attacked migrants we spoke to people in Cottbus and here's what they told us they make it look like asylum seekers or whoever attacked the Germans but there are also cases where it happened the other way around for example three Afghans were beaten up by a group of Germans on New Year's Eve over the next few days though nobody reported on it only later thanks to the efforts of an activist group it was made public it's not a solution to the problem not accepting any more migrants doesn't solve the problem we have here in cottbus in any case people don't feel as safe as they used to there is some insecurity here I think there is a need for action in the city however the way the authorities are dealing with this situation might be a little bit questionable probably they could have looked into this case more deeply to see whether there are other options three other communities in the region of Lower Saxony have also banned migrants my colleague Neil Harvey discussed this with Hugh Bronson from the alternative for Germany party the only been a handful of attacks by migrants in cottbus as well as some on migrants themselves isn't a ban excessive well not to the victims of those violent attacks it isn't there were about 3,000 migrants who have entered coppice and mostly there are young males from North Africa and Syria bringing with them a completely different culture of conflict resolution there is a breaking point for even the most tolerant of communities and apparently this breaking point has been reached that's your opinion locals though certainly aren't all in support of this ban nobody saying that any violence is acceptable but some people suggesting you know that there may be more twisting this than meets the eye maybe six of one half a dozen of the other and the perhaps more options should be explored is that not a good idea well I'm afraid there's little to no time left to explore other options there's a big tension building up and many communities and cities are simply fed up the German Treasury has admitted that in the last year alone more than 22 billion euros were needed to accommodate these 1.5 million migrants and this is of course a large sum of money now try to explain this to millions of Germans who are living on the breadline having two jobs and trying very desperately to make ends meet
