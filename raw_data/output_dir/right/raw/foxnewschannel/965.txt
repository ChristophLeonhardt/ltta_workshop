105
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,230
IT'S ONE THING FOR US TO SAY.

106
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,298
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO SAY IF THE

107
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:24,999

ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS, THAT THIS

191
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,945
ENTIRE SPECIAL CONSOLE SEEMS

192
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:52,646
LIKE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL

193
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:53,046
UNDERTAKING.

194
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:56,216
THERE IS NO REAL OVERSIGHT.

195
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:58,218
THEY ESSENTIALLY HAVE A

196
00:05:58,218 --> 00:05:59,653
LIMITLESS BUDGET, SEEMS LIKE

197
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:01,622
THEY DO.

198
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,690
>> THEY DO.

199
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,858
>> THE PRESIDENT SUPPOSEDLY

200
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:06,260
CAN'T REMOVE HIM.

201
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,429
IS THERE ANY EXECUTIVE BRANCH

202
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:11,431
OVERSIGHT IF ROD ROSENSTEIN IS

203
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:11,832
CONFLICTED?

204
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,433
>> HE SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF.

205
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,134
BASED ON THE FACTS WE'VE SEEN,

206
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:17,404
YOU SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF.

207
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,606
BUT THAT ASIDE, IN THIS COUNTRY,

208
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:20,207
YOU INVESTIGATE CRIMES.

209
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,242
YOU DON'T GO IN AND START TO

210
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:23,243
INVESTIGATE AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN

211
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:26,613
FIND AND HELP TO COME UP WITH A

212
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:27,614
CRIME AFTER YOU'VE INVESTIGATED.

213
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:29,016
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE SPECIAL

214
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:30,851
CONSOLE DOING IT AND I THINK

215
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:31,351
IT'S WRONG.

216
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:32,619
>> Laura: DIDN'T HE SAY HE

217
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:34,021
WOULD MAKE THE DOCUMENTS

218
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,123
AVAILABLE TO THE SO-CALLED GANG

219
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:36,490
OF EIGHT?

220
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,225
>> THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

221
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:39,026
TOMORROW.

222
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:39,860
WE WILL SEE.

223
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,627
>> THEIR PRESS RELEASE THAT THEY

224
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,397
WERE GOING TO DO TODAY.

225
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:44,498
>> Laura: TODAY, TUESDAY.

226
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:47,935
>> NOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

227
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:48,302
THURSDAY.

228
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:50,804
>> Laura: WHAT ARE GOWDY AND

229
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:51,205
RYAN SAYING?

230
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:58,612
>> WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM.

231
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:00,414
THE FACTS ARE ON OUR SIDE.

232
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:03,150
HOW LONG IS LONG ENOUGH?

233
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,784
I AM SAYING TODAY IS LONG

234
00:07:03,784 --> 00:00:00,000
ENOUGH.
