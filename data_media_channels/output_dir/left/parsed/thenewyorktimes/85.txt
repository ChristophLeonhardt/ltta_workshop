MoviePass is a ticket
subscription service
for movie theaters.
You pay one fee a month —
$10 right at the moment,
although that’s changing —
and you can see a movie a day.
August of last year,
they decided
that they would
drastically reduce prices
to boost
membership drastically.
It became too popular
too quickly,
and so they haven’t
had the money
to pay for all
of those tickets.
Their concept was that more
people would pay than go.
They say that they’re
profitable on about 88 percent
of their customers.
The problem though,
are that they have some very
rabid moviegoers.
In New York, let’s say,
a ticket costs $16.
I go to a movie every day
and I’m only paying $10.
Yet MoviePass is
paying full price
for all of those tickets
to the theater owners.
You can see why their
bank account is just
going down, down, down.
The C.E.O. told me in
April, “We wanted
to get too big to ignore,”
so they could force
discounts from theater owners
and say, “Hey, we have all this
data on who’s going to movies.
Pay us for
that information —
we’ll give it to you.”
But studios are
terrified that people
will come to expect
$10 a month
movie-a-day experience.
There’s has been a bit
of old-fashioned hubris.
Just moving too
fast, too quickly.
“MoviePass is dying.”
“MoviePass,
the dream is over.”
“How am I going
to keep this up?”
They weren't
capitalized enough
to make their
plans work out.
But more people are
going to movies,
especially if there’s a
movie that they’re not
quite sure that it’s going
to make sense for them.
It takes out the risk
and for indie movies
and arthouse movies
they’ve seen a
big bump from MoviePass.
