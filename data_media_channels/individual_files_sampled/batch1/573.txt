Oh under a gray wet London sky in one of the Capitals main tourist sights and a Syrian human headed bull sculpture takes its place recast for The Times the Lama su one of our ongoing series of works by the Iraqi American artist Michael Rockets entitled the invisible enemy should not exist it was commissioned to occupy the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square it's both a portrayal of Iraq's resilience after decades of conflict and the losses suffered human and cultural the sculpture is also a reconstruction of the ancient statues destroyed by ISIL as fighters invaded the Iraqi city of Mosul three years ago mythological figures destroyed by war when the Iraq Wars began when I was growing up it was terrifying to see the places that my grandparents fled to destroy the place they fled from so I think for me rebuilding the lamassu and this impulse to reconstruct as a way of remembering you know of suturing and healing the breach or amending the breach six thousand cans of date syrup went into making this work of art and it's part of an ongoing project to recreate thousands of artifacts that were either lost or destroyed in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion a bittersweet reminder of Iraq's cultural richness it took four months to recreate this lamassu and using those date syrup cans and not to what was once Iraq second biggest export after oil since devastated by war and disease displaying the work in London also a reminder of the part that UK had as a member of the coalition that invaded Iraq in 2003 it's not an attack on London it's a reminder of the culture that was destroyed as a result of actions that were frankly against London that's marched against that war we had millions in the streets so it's not it's not a poke in the eye at the Londoners themselves but it's a reminder of happens when political office teachers go wrong the lamassu replica is due to be displayed in the heart of London for the next two years a far cry from its origins but a memory of an ancient civilization that continues to fascinate and survive against the odds Sonia Vega al-jazeera London
