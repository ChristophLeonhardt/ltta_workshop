hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle release the memo Russia Gate morphs into FBI gate also are the US and Turkey on the path to confrontation in Syria and the great debate Jordan Peterson is called a one-man army and has taken the internet by storm Krauss FBI gate I'm joined by my guest mark Sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Victoria Levesque he's a political analyst as well as a leading expert at the center for actual politics and we have Dimitri Babak she is a political analyst with Sputnik International alright gentleman crosstalk rules in effect and you know always can jump in Demon's let me go to you first here are we going to see a new meme a new debate like who lost Turkey because if we remember when the Communists came to power in China there was lost China and it ruined a lot of careers because people didn't get it right okay are we who's losing turkey who's gaining turkey go ahead well let me remind you that in 1999 there was a big debate who lost Russia and it was at the times when supposedly Russia was so democratic mr. Yeltsin was Steven power and these honest guys to bias and others who the quote the report quoted as having want us out of a few billion dollars right that's about you know the honest Yeltsin's guys the young reformers but what's going on now between Turkey and the United States is unbelievable I mean trying to remove a relatively loyal regime in in Syria which you know mr. Assad was oriented towards the European Union more than towards Russia the United States at NATO almost a much more important country Turkey yeah but what they might lose they might lose an alliance on top of it go ahead look the United States today faces a very stark choice the US has the Kurds in Syria as a is about the only force the only viable force and they're embedded with yes that would support partition of the factual partition of Syria and and that supports the u.s. and and if so the u.s. can support the Kurds and then it gets the ire of Turkey we see that happening now or the United States gonna stop supporting the Kurds that Turkey would be happy about that but then the United States would be left with almost no credible serious support force on Syrian territory and no reason to justify their continuing chases ally with the Kurds and have Turkey as as an adversarial power considering that Turkey has the second largest army Aneta various question but yes one of the things is - is that everyone he can't afford to lose in Syria he's put too much into it he's politically security invested I don't believe that peace in Syria is possible you know the question isn't while Bashar al-assad continues in Syria but while Aragon continues in Ankara I heard 'god must go hashtag vertigo let's go you've been in the military what is the possibility of some kind of confrontation here because just as I just said in you just said here everyone is not going to back down this means a lot to him and his legitimacy at home and the ongoing problem they've had with Curtis the United States is it is it so important to the United States because if you look at the the defense community intelligence community even in the u.s. they're divided about what's going yet yes in fact you're starting to see splits not only among the administration but in the foreign policy blob between the neo cons and the liberal imperialists they're divided on this issue and Victor is exactly right you either get a Kurdish Protectorate carved out of East Syria to continue to destabilize Syria and weak and Iran thus by weakening one of their allies or you get to may continue your relationship with Turkey as a member of NATO and in a US Turkish alliance which allows us military bases in Turkey that their flights are necessary for controlling the region also gives the United States access to the Black Sea which is Russia's on their belly of course so there's big geopolitical questions here but obviously this is a self-created blowback we've been saying on the show all along that if the u.s. tried to partition East Syria with the Kurds they would face blowback politically both from Turkey and from Iraq likewise Oregon has created this situation where he calls Kurdish terrorists there's no evidence that any Syrian Kurds have been involved in terrorism on his territory but he created this by illegally arming training and salaries sectarian Miller arming and supporting the cursor there's one good thing about all of this situation finally we heard the truth about the United States financing terrorists out of the mouths of babes no out of the mouths of mr. haire true God and so he that's why I say it's not a shortage of people arming in public terrorists it's not an innocent baby but he basically admitted something that all the other NATO members have known but they have been hiding it so Aragon having been put in this quagmire where he drove himself by his decision to change the regime in in Syria he is now I'm sorry he's now spewing out the truth the existence the possibility of a Kurdish state when Turkish borders is an existential threat to Turkey any president of whether his name is God or anything else would do right now do exactly what the other gun is doing these IV the Kurds yes he made mistakes I agree wholeheartedly with mark as far as that he got the start he was one of those that supported the Syrian civil war he created the situation where the Syrian Kurds who were who have now more power more autonomy and more willingness to act against Turkish and Turkish interest then everyone he has to choose now I mean if he continues down this path or he wants to drive all the way all the way to the Iraqi border here I mean is he going to have to choose NATO or not NATO I mean where's the level of negotiations oh it's a gray zone he he he's not willing at this point to take turkey out of NATO there isn't even a mechanism set for that but at the same time Turkey and air the gun is not going to do anything that will endanger the national security and sovereignty of the Turkish state hey okay what is who's bluffing here mark hey everyone's blow everyone's everyone is bluffing at this point including the Syrian government and Russia the Kurds in Afrin have now officially called publicly for the Syrian government to help come in and protect them against the Turkish invasion this isn't going to be met because they aren't fully they didn't fully agree to demands that Russia and the Syrian government set for them which included completely dismantling the Kurdish militias and either moving east to the u.s. controlled territory or joining the Syrian army plus relinquishing control of oil fields in eastern Syria which is the current demon if the Kurds before this encouragement started a little over a week ago if they had just taken the deal to pick up the Syrian flag that wouldn't no no that was the that was the minimalist demand they accepted that there was a maximalist demand from Russia and the Syrian government and there was no negotiation a compromise position should have been official the the Kurds are Alpher offered that at the time they they're offering that now that's not another habit of choosing the wrong side well you know why choose the wrong side one pace and that's what the carrots are doing now let's hope that the Kurds will have a voice at the Congress of Syria and minorities that that is going to be held in Sochi you know in the coming days but actually if you look at the pattern it repeats itself in Syria you know the the the foreign invaders I'm sorry they'd have been trying to remove the Syrian government created more and more problems you know the United States intervened in Syria in order to replace a person who was not actually anti-western mr. Assad and they've got a terrible problem with the Islamic state you know which was much more dangerous than tennis has taken together right Turkey wanted to put its own people in power in Syria they've got the Kurdish state right next to their border but you see it seems like it's the worst possible outcomes if you look at it here I mean Victor how does this change I mean the rest of Syria we have reconciliation going on the Syrian army is essentially one against these terrorist groups it's just the border area between Syria proper and Turkey this is it a new conflict a very different and it can be confined and now Turkey will have to clean this up near its borders every single power that in the region that has a significant Kurdish population Turkey Iran Iraq Syria is opposed to an independent Kurdish state so it's not just Turkey every single nation says how does it mark how this play into the the huge minority of Kurds inside of Turkey and what's going on in Syria I mean do we see more would you foresee a lot more blowback now well that's obviously the concern and and the Erdogan regime has forbidden Kurds to protest against this euphemistically named operation and believe Olive Branch as he's invading Syria and bombing cities you know it to me let's frame this properly Aragon who has all along been that you know Turkey the war against Syria couldn't exist without the Turkish border the Disneyland it provided for jihadists that the moms training centers that the US and Saudi Arabia sent up to funnel salaries and czars turkey is still supplying al Qaeda with weapons for offensive they are literally as reported in the Western mainstream media doing joint patrols with al Qaeda and attacks on Afrin as they call someone else terrorists it's it's just aurelion it's aurelion and this could lead to turkish confrontation with the u.s. their proxies aren't having a good time in Afrin and there already has lost in syria and now it's going to potentially suffer another loss in space against a NATO ally it's really quite amazing well I think again the only good outcome here is that we are here in the truth I think what the German media is saying about Aragon and that mark has just quoted that that is most likely the truth but what Aragon is saying about Germany is now is also truth you know Germany is not democratic you know it prevented Aragon and turkey from appealing to their citizens on the German territory during the elections so no one is in this situation and and the good thing is that they they unmask each other we see the truth now we couldn't see it it seems to me that and we're gonna have to go be doing this in the future but if this conflict is definitely transforming and it has much less to do with Syria than it does with foreign players inside of so yes gentlemen I'm gonna jump in here we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on real news stay with arty welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter labelled remind you we're discussing some real news okay gentlemen let's switch gears here we're being promised I don't know if it's gonna happen Victor but this week we'll get that four paged memo released to the public that is details the use or misuse of FISA warrants to listen on into American citizens the GOP of course is spinning this as some kind of silver bullet the left is dismissing it as a conspiracy picture it is unlikely to change the trajectory of the Robert Miller investigation and here's his way towards sitting elected American president however however it's part of a trend towards the unmaking of the American political order now the what what Democrats and the American security services started hoping to remove Trump really backfired and we see that and yes they will go on they will try to remove Trump but the same tack but at the same time the damage they're suffering and it's not just them but they make it CV you can you're consistent in your position and I like it and we're gonna see how it plays out I'm keeping track of everything you've said on this mark but still I would say countering victory is it so far Russia Gate has yielded nothing okay look a couple of few indictments but none of it has to do with Russia but if this four page memo from what we've heard this is Ana masking of the highest levels of the FBI and it shows that how intelligence was weaponized against political foes that will be the real scandal er I don't know if the media if the liberal media will reflect that but in fact that may be what's happening head but you might have a problem with that but I don't think the majority of the media yeah has a problem with that and I don't think the majority of the American people really care on either side what's going into this point there was a CNN political reporter my restin who admitted on inside politics this week that all CNN talks about is Russia Russia Russia this Russia gate but no one no one no no really no one out in the United States actually cares I gotta agree with Victor I don't think this will be a silver bullet either way I think you know this this witch-hunt will continue I'm far more interested in the way that the Democrats and the media have tried to frame it they have argued through this anonymous anti-propaganda propaganda unit the the Alliance for securing democracy Hamilton 68s dashboard which purports to follow a group of Russian BOTS even though Twitter says they've shut them all down that they're not going to name that they never named who they're actually following that they report to be promoting oh they're obviously following you know because I've never had any of these things that they're talking about I mean last week these Russian bots that they follow that the primary thing that Russia was promoting via social media was Monday motivations I mean because obviously more monday motivations is a Putin s plot against the United Syria you're saying the masks are coming up I think in this case the masks are coming off as well the masks have been coming off for the last I would say two or three years you know FBI at least Edgar Edgar J Hoover at least he acted secret here okay he tried to influence the internal politics of the United States but he can't his secret files and he had to die before you know the truth came he probably wouldn't have used Twitter he was simply a much more decent person than he was oh the people who he was much more effective he wasn't he was more intensive that's what I say there was more distance that the guys were acting now I mean mr. Comey who was first accused of acted against Hillary Clinton when he didn't stop the investigation against her right before the election now he's been lionized by the media you know there's a person who was prompt again you know the funny thing is now Comey is being considered for professors position teaching ethics Peter struck will be who's teaching you exactly exactly I stole that from that would make a great pair there I think this is very serious right here because it shows I mean I've said this on this program before people could have a right to their opinion and you can say whatever you want about the President of the United States but if it's connected up with your job in stonewalling or creating an artificial trap as we it appears to be unraveling you know there's a lot of other text messages we need to read but I mean it certainly is suggestive you know Russia Gate is really not about Russia Russia gate is about American security services they make an intelligence community unlawfully unconstitutionally targeting inserting itself into domestic American politics Russia gate is about American media that instead of doing its job he's doing the bidding of the CIA of the FBI and other agencies unelected officials whose special connected with special interests of the American elite we all there is what Russia gate is about yeah I think we all agree on that and not only you know the media is acting on this but you know the partisan divide there's always the hope that enough Republicans will be outraged by Trump's behavior to swing this because we have to remember that Russia gate is a smokescreen designed to keep this going until the midterm elections so the Democrats can ride this and then they can push for impeachment why because impeachment is not a legal process as each minute is a political process so it's a vehicle Russia gate is a vehicle for them to go after Trump but it doesn't necessarily have to come back with any evidence of collusion again there again pushing for obstruction of justice charges and Trump is says he's willing to testify in person which is a here used a huge mistake perhaps he should reply to pranks were the opposition to term the American political establishment the tip state is going the first prong is pressure on Trump's family members Jared Kushner Ivanka there may be an attempt to which we put an ultimatum in front of Strom either you step down at some point would that's that is never ever gonna happen Victor but in the second but we will we will find again in the second section of justice charges where a rabid Mueller is going crazy okay we'll find out gentlemen here all right I want to switch gears here to the what I thought was really one of the most incredible examples of TV TV ad discussion it was a Jordan Peterson on the channel for discussing with the interviewer Kathleen Newman initial reactions gentlemen because I thought it was very very interesting an ideological conflict and I think the winner was quite obvious deema did you watch it well I did but you know I find it all just a part of the same thing you know disfranchising the people your opinion does not count if it doesn't coincide with the opinion of the mainstream globalist liberal elite and this is the same thing with with the elections you voted for mr. Trump but your vote is not quite legitimate it's you are not eligible to vote people if you vote for someone like Trump and and you know the lies continue in a way but I mean what it was interesting about Victor is that I what I thought I mean from my position sitting in this chair here is how this interviewer was constantly trying to reframe the argument over and over again based on a rabid ideology I would say and without facts and that's what made the the debate really interesting is because Peterson always came back with facts and and knowledge and and that's what I thought the juxtaposition was here was rabid ideology and it was done very sloppily and that's why there are so many viewers who watch this debate who are talking about it why does this gap if this happens every time when when you see somebody saying something that is outside that framework that the liberal Western media tries to tries to force on people and and this type of debate or these types of programs were on on different subjects whether its subject concerning gender whether it's subject concerning politics and observation once you get out of that framework people actually start watching start start talking about it because people do not believe yes there are there are many that switch on CNN and think yes that's 1% to it but there are many that do not believe that and they they want to see they want to see the truth being or if anything see a real debate yes fake debate yes the mainstream have also done so by squashing real debate channels and media outlets like CNN like MSNBC ABC NBC and so forth they are really they're really creating a problem for themselves because eventually millions of people will try to see that's which news outlets they are the quintessential examples of ideological you think people will go somewhere else all right like I'm here I agree with you completely the most amazing thing was how she continually tried to repackage what he was saying in terms that she would rather argue against to build up straw man so what now say out so what you're saying what you're saying a nice no that's not what I said and that was actually the majority of the debate didn't no that's not what I said you're trying to read what you want into what I said and you know this continued from the both day and they're both actually arguing from ideological positions he just presented his in a lot more reasoned arguments and this you saw what was an interview turn into a debate and I think and his train ready one of them more than just the style of it I think there was III there's a lot of things that I I've eminently disagree with Jordan Pederson with but his talking about he didn't use the words but he's you know talking about evolutionary biology he's talking about sociobiology right about fundamental sociological biological differences between the sexes which which I agree with he talked about the difference between a quality of of potential of opportunity and compared between the forced equality of outcome which I agree with completely and what he's talking about there is I to me in this particular issue the difference between classical feminism which was about providing that equality of opportunity and where this is gone I don't agree that it's Marxist in the slide it's actually post modernism stolen from the Frankfurt School which as far as I'm concerned is anti-marxist but it's they're pushing a forced equality of outcome which goes against these social projects run out of time gentleman I think that's why actually was Victor's mind that's why so many people watch it because they realize what they hear 24/7 is ideological nonsense many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching us here RT this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk polls now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri Victor while we were going to the break theory you wanted to continue the discussion a little bit about the Jordan Peterson Kathy Newman debate code what we also really see is that a lot of those are on the liberal side a lot of the ideologues they do not really believe what they're saying at heart we can remember Lawrence Summers and his speech about general differences that that got him a lot of criticism Pryor didn't it eventually yes yes yes and from Lawrence Summers is no conservative ideologue this is a person of liberal pedigree so we see that really even in the debate with Jordan Peterson we don't really know what what he's interviewer truly believe it well I I'm not sure if that's true but when it seems to me that these are just dogmas that are just memorized I mean they're not they're not seriously okay equal pay for both sexes here I mean I think you know on a normative level with it yeah if you do the same work he should be paid for but then you turn to a clinical psychologist as an expert on the human mind and character and behavior and saying well it's not that simple and I think that's what Jordan Peterson was saying in every single issue it's not that oh oh he talked way over head because what she did was talk about broad generalizations about ideology no she wouldn't probably call it ideology and every single step he said you know you basically you have an ideological overreach because it doesn't match reality and what one of the other questions is if she really believes all she was saying he dumped her so apparently she's not so tied to her convictions exactly deema you hear on this program you're mr. ideology well the problem with our outer liberal ideology I prefer this term to neoliberal because now is just something new outer is when you drive certain sensible things to the extreme like the quality of sexist the quality of generous well the problem with this ideology is that it different changes it makes certain groups of people not eligible not eligible for the Olympic Games that we have seen this week you know when out of 500 Russian athletes only about hundred sixty-nine were allowed to go to Pyeongchang and a neutral flag no Russian flags were not allowed even into the stadiums right why no explanation was given you know all the people whose names were in the so-called maclaurins list they have been cleaned out already so even people not on the list were not allowed to go yes exactly you know 219 people who were not on the list who were not given any explanation why you can't go to the Olympic Games well it may seem a different story but it's from the same from the same trend you know people in Spain the Parliament they have enacted puts them all again you know the leader of the Catalan autonomy what was the decision from the Spanish Court no he can't be the leader of the autonomy basically we don't care how people voted we don't care what the Parliament decided but this is the disconnect here because I think one of the things that Jordan Peterson brings up which is very close to my heart and I like very much is it you know we we have two generations brought up on demand your rights your rights your rights and and someone comes along a pretty smart guy I would say and this is what what about responsibility and I think this is a young people you know you know these snowflakes and you know you know people leading their safe places I mean III when I lived in the in America there were no such things okay so this is really new I mean I I guess these days you can get triggered which is something new for me in safe zone okay okay no but that means I'm rights are more legal than what I think isn't really important and I think that's why so many young men follow Jordan Peterson is because he speaks to them about being responsible in your life because liberal this ultra liberal ideology doesn't ask you that if they don't that question is not raised whatsoever about your responsibility and if you're responsible you're strong if you can constantly I'm talking about right so it makes you weak you're crossing my red lines and threatening me oh yeah by a truck imitating a snowflake right yeah okay I'm gonna switch gears go ahead all right Davos okay president Trump went to Davos and there was talk ahead of time in the liberal media there was gonna be some kind of walk out and everything of course none of that happened and what we saw both was Trump doing an about-face from his entire own political base in the campaign he ran on against the globalists and being embraced by the same 1% the transnational neoliberal elite the ultimate cocktail party this is the ultimate cocktail party it shows the collusion and all of our societies the neoliberal ideology between governments and the big corporations how the corporation's help these politicians get elected then the politicians reward them with prime contracts for what they're doing and then the revolving door when they write and they write all the laws and the politicians a revolving door they leave office and go to work for the same countries lobbying for the same things and Trump was embraced as one of them as the Dow shoots to unparalleled highs so I think passing 26,000 this week he did an about-face against his base but was welcomed by the same people you know that have you know this was a doom and gloom I guess I'm the caster ideology so mark it means you can't fight against it you can't win no but the fight against it certainly doesn't come by electing you know businessman as champions of the little tiny neoliberal economics but this was obvious I mean we we talked about the differences between us for know I've always said you look foreign policies gone it looks like he's caved immigration and just whittling down because it's interesting what happened to the Russian team which went to Davos you means Fairbank I mean yes yeah Borka which the Russian Vice Premier who went there he said that Americans were hiding from us they were avoiding us that is that was for this is the problem without a liberal I've got the goodies that I mean that's the bro safe space in Russia they know what happened to Flynn he talks to Russian ambassador now where is he yes they know what's happened two sessions sessions talk to the Russian ambassador then you get to recuse himself you know the problem is that a part of the Russian oh I always keep my distance from the rational solution is indeed wants to join the global history yes they are making a tremendous effort the problem may have centered not a lot you know between it for centuries something wrong with the new globalist elite you know it demonizes everyone who disagrees with them on one point you know Trump wanted to get rid of the trans-pacific partnership and TTIP which were basically bad projects they declared him an evil man heterogeneity because of that and it turned out that these decisions actually brought manufacturing jobs to the United States but I think rationally I don't think the evidence is what I think it's really early really saying that to say that circle ActiveX I mean vector Russia's dilemma you know Russia has been trying to achieve a compromise with the Western lid on many issues including Ukraine right and now what do we get you know the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe declares the Russian war against Ukraine responsible for 1.6 million people who are internally displaced and almost half a million people who are seeking asylum in other countries most of them in Russia end of quote so Russia is accused of taking a country and then attracting you know if not a refugee I was trained as a story I don't know of any precedent in history where the alleged aggressor is the one that absorbs the population of the country under sanctions unable Russian the same the Parliamentary Assembly wants Russia to pay to pay its views into the assembly it's very liberal like waiting for the bullets that somebody's going to shoot yours should here for these kind of resolutions but so I think the Russian elite at a certain moment will have to make a choice either they go to Davos and they try to find Americans who avoid them you know or they talk to the Parliamentary Assembly who made some statements I don't think any credible person should go to Davos I think it's a complete fraud okay and it's time to end the design you've nonsense why you know all these people are interested in saving the environment they all fly there and their private jets give me a break but the buzzword right that's the big topic the the branding of this Davos right you know the this between this and the trilateral commission they are literally the the smoke-filled rooms of the global 1% transnational class inequality they were discussing any quality Wow they they rested in their $500 a night hotel rooms and ate their $59 apiece hamburger more the more inequality is being discussed that that was the morning equality that is in the world I mean look at the time Davos is by definition the generator the generator the generator of theology and the policies and the agreements that drive this and what we saw with Trump's appearance there I think was a renewed renegotiation of the terms of the liberal international order the u.s. controlled global military and economic system it's as if trumpets new management and he's got new ideas about the terms of the negotiations and with this American first slogan America's first so what you're saying mark is that next year there'll be a Trump Hotel there okay and everybody can stay there they've absorbed him they have accepted it the globally is signaled with his reception there that they are willing to renegotiate the terms of US leadership a Germany as they call it slightly more in favor of US economic interests that that was Trump's big triumph against globalization I chose you know it shows their ideological veracity and commitment to their ideas on which I think is shameful that's it gentlemen I hope our viewers have enjoyed the extended version of our program and we'll see you next week remember crosstalk wills you
