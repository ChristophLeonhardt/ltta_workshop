so naturally the attacks on Bernier were left to the CBC itself Canada's state broadcaster they have done story after story on the evil Bernier first trying to exacerbate the rift between Bernie and Cher now I get it but there's obviously a tension there there's tension between the two men there has been since the day of the leadership vote there as you know enter Shearer has insisted on the dairy cartel and policies like that Bernier was kicked out for calling for an end to protectionism for Quebec farmers so yeah there is tension fair enough the CBC went Anna well like the liberal say I haven't seen them do the same thing to Trudeau though about you know going to every single Liberal cabinet minister every single Liberal MP and asking them what they think about Trudeau groping the tersh of a female reporter in BC I haven't seen it seem seriously going to every single liberal MP and asking them what they think should happen to it khalid the muslim extremist MP who was caught giving a high honor to an anti-semite not once but twice and when you know it there he is with Trudeau to call yet apologized yesterday we'll talk more about this today with Anthony fury it was an accident she said an accident both times she said that's good enough for the CBC don't need to flog a dead horse but let me show you the lowest part here this shows you the deep corruption of journalism in the state broadcaster after going on about Bernie a look at what the CBC said also significant is the timing Bernier chose to send his messages on the first anniversary of the riots in Charlottesville Virginia a milestone for people who believe whites are under some kind of cultural attack we did reach out to Maxine Bernier today to see if he'd talk rosy but he didn't respond what nothing in Bernie's tweets talked about the United States or about race other than to positively say he supports all races and ethnicities why on earth did the CBC say that Bernie a chose to make his comments on the anniversary of a u.s. racist March Brittany has made similar comments before and after that arbitrary 282 but the CBC in true state broadcaster propaganda fashion true Pravda style they said that Bernier shows that anniversary now they admit immediately admitted that they hadn't spoke to him as you saw but so what they just made it up and they showed that racist riot video just in case you were too thick to understand their insinuations the whole time Bernier is a racist you guys I wonder who he's trying to talk to let's play some racist riot footage yeah maybe it's that their second the CBC they're sick the fake news aren't they well we were talking about tweets let me end with three tweets here's Bernie replying to that fake news smear he wrote just saw this report which implies a timing between my tweets last Sunday and some violent demonstration in the u.s. how do you know that I chose to send my messages on the first anniversary of the rides in Strongsville this is despicable fake news it is despicable it is fake news but then again when rosemary Barton is such a fangirl of Justin Trudeau that she literally takes selfies with him and puts those selfies in I don't in his scrapbook or in her hope chest under her bed I don't know maybe she puts that picture up in her locker in high school he's so dreamy what do you expect from a journalist like that that's super gross well she replied to Bernie and it's amazing she wrote this how do we she misses a word no how do we know you didn't time to coincide with that anniversary giving you won't give any interviews to anyone about anything you tweet how about you answer some questions and defend your position in front of people that we can talk about what's fake thanks for watching real news how do we know you didn't do it to kansai coincide with some us neo-nazis how do we know that you didn't we couldn't ask you so we just did invented the answer how do we know did you stop beating your wife yet didn't say no so we assumed you had unbelievable here last word to Bernie he said whether or not I give interviews your job is to report facts not unfounded and calumny as' speculation you admit you have no idea if there was a connection I treat almost everyday and was not even aware of this event in the u.s. you were biased and unprofessional absolutely true and I love the Bernie a is calling out the CBC as fake news because we all know they are fake news and Barton more or less admit it in this exchange to that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
