I think the Liberals are interfering in your attempts to help the Canadian military and now we need your help to make sure it never happens again you know I think it is probably to our collective neglect and embarrassment that we don't more often stop and honor and thank the military these seemingly ordinary Canadians who are so willing to do the extraordinary in defense of Canadian values you remember Canadian values don't you those are those things these men and women are willing to die for yet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says those same values just don't exist no really just after his 2015 election Trudeau told the New York Times there is no core identity no mainstream in Canada well I think there is a core identity and it is defended in some way every single day by the men and women who wear a uniform in the Canadian military and you know what else we don't stop enough to honor the extreme sacrifices of every family that is behind that uniform I really don't think we are able to thank them enough and I don't think that we can really do enough for them but we should try and we did try or rather we tried to help all of you try to thank our military and their families for their service and their sacrifice but liberal meddlers and interlopers just won't let us remember back in December when we tried to raise money for CFB Borden because we heard through the grapevine that military families were being asked to share their food in hampers for other struggling families on the base and you know what we appreciated the sentiment we are our neighbor's keeper but we also thought it was insane for the federal government to ask Canadian troops to share amongst themselves well the federal government was handing out 10.5 million dollars to a convicted terrorist murderer named Omar Khadr but with your help we put together $15,000 for the base but CFB Borden actually refused them it was weird so we asked you since it's your donation what we should do with these funds we were told we should donate it to Canada company now they are a trusted Canadian charity with a great rating and a low overhead that serves the Canadian military and their families they were the perfect fit for us so our team got in contact with Canada company who seemed happy and eager to take your donation and they did just watch and pulp so what I'm gonna do is on the behalf of the rebel news network is present you with this check for slightly over fifteen thousand dollars courtesy of our very generous viewers and we really appreciate folks you coming up to the plate yet again and maybe Paul can you tell our viewers what you know some of the things that money might be going towards well as first of all thank you very much to you and to revere us for raising this money and we gladly accept it and gladly gonna use it to help our veterans but then it happened again soon after David Menzies met with Canada company our office got this email I regret to inform you that Canada company is unable to accept the cheque presented this afternoon as our policies do not permit us to endorse political views of any organization as such we will be returning the cheque to your attention via registered mail we aren't a political organization and it isn't our money it's yours we were only the vehicle that helped gather up these funds so what happened in that very short time between when David Menzies skipped happily into Canada company and met with some very grateful folks and the email declining your donations well here's what I think I think the feds got to them and the reason I think that is because Canada company is a good charity that does good work that always puts military families first they always have you know who doesn't put our veterans and military families first though the Canadian government Justin Trudeau and his cabinet of progressive liberal weirdos who believe in such ridiculous notions as toxic masculinity and feminist peacekeeping deployment they don't so much care for our military do they I was prepared to be killed in action what I wasn't prepared for mr. Prime Minister is Canada how turning its back on me so which veteran was it that you were talking about thank you for having the courage to stand here and thank you for listening to my answer on a couple of elements you brought up first of all why are we still fighting against certain veterans groups in court because they are asking for more than we are able to give right now do you doubt for a second that a government who would support a prime minister after he told a wounded veteran he was grandi right to his face would then also interfere to block a donation to veterans from a political enemy I certainly don't to the Liberals their petty grudges and uncontrolled emotions against us and really against all of you are so much more important to them than the men and women who serve in uniform and their families who stand behind them and that is a real betrayal but not of us because I don't care if a liberal doesn't like me but it's a real betrayal of those military men and women and their families and the Liberals ongoing responsibilities to them and the Liberals are trying to make a good charity take all the political fallout here it is one of the grossest things I have ever seen and I'm from the internet so I have seen it all I think the liberals don't want military charities to have your donations because you're conservative now if the federal government is relying on liberal minded people to cover the gap to step up and support military charities they're going to have to wait a long damn time but I need your help now to make sure this never happens again that the Liberals never stand in our way in your way when we try to honor our military together we have a petition it's at call off your dogs calm the text is simple we demand the Trudeau government stop blocking donations from conservative Canadians who want to support our military and David Menzies is going to hand-deliver that petition to the office of Harjit Sajjan the Defense Minister this is not going to stop us though we will continue to raise to support military causes like we did for Christopher Spears children made fatherless by that aforementioned now wealthy terrorist Omar Khadr we will find a military charity that will take your donations because this isn't about us and it isn't about the Liberals and it isn't even about you it's about helping our military please sign our petition at call off your dogs calm for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunnery we demand the Trudeau government stop blocking donations from conservative minded Canadians like you who want to support our military sign our petition at call off your dogs calm you
