00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,469
hey you don't have to keep calling that

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,120

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,859

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,220
counts picky you are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,970
harry potter forever you play Quidditch

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,559
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick like official league I</font>

10
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,020
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced to read the Philosopher's</font>

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,809
Stone when I first started<font color="#E5E5E5"> high school</font>

12
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,300
secondary school we call that it really

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
put me off I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never read any of the books</font>

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,320
and therefore never really wanted to see

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,140
the movies oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">a board game at the end of the year in</font>

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,510
which we had to prove our understanding

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,910
of the book and everyone got into detail

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,620
about all the narrative and all the

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,930
characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> and mine was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> escape from</font>

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">Harry Potter where you roll a dice and</font>

22
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,060
then that's how many spaces you go and

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,890
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it for hurry and if</font>

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,810
Harry catches up with you you die<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go</font>

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,760
to hell so so how did that prove that

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,650
you understood anything about it just

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,270
just that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> character named</font>

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,560
Harry Potter yeah it just proved my

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,689
understanding that I didn't like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

30
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,250
doesn't prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you ready I mean</font>

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,590
Santa fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was as if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a good</font>

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,360
game had lots of fun there to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,180
grade yeah this anyway the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,340
fascinating to me is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to this and</font>

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,439
I'm not someone who just because I

36
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't watched it all didn't like it</font>

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,000
from my childhood experiences I wasn't

40
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,409
I was absolutely amazed by it was

41
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,380
incredible if someone who has never seen

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,899
all the movies I guess what is your

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,640
understanding of the story of harry

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,950

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,300

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,420
on his he<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a scar on the storm I</font>

54
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,340
don't know was it birthmark or was it a

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,720
scar but it's like a lightning bolt he

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,280
