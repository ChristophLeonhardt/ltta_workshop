ON STATE ROUTE 130 IN 
SCHOHARIE. 
A BLEW A STOP SIGN AT AN 
INTERCEPTION AND PLOWED INTO A 
PARKING LOT OUTSIDE OF THE 
APPLE BARREL COUNTRY STORE. 
THE  LIMO SLAMMED INTO AN 
UNOCCUPIED TOYOTA HIGHLANDER 
AND TWO PEDESTRIANS BEFORE 
CAREENING DOWN A SLOPE. 
>>> WE WANT TO TURN OUT TO NEW 
YORK WHERE WE ARE GETTING AN 
UPDATE ON THE INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE DEADLY LIMOUSINE CRASH 
OVER THE WEEKEND. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> WE DO KNOW THAT THEY WERE 
ACTIVE ON THEIR CELL PHONES 
PRIOR TO THE CRASH, OF TEXTING 
AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA. 
WE ARE ASKING THAT ANYONE WHO 
MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 
THE VICTIMS BEFORE THE CRASH 
GIVE US A CALL AT 518-630-1700. 
I WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS 
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS 
IS AN ONGOING CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT.  
>> WILL YOU TELL US WHETHER OR 
NOT THAT VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN ON THE ROAD? 
NOW THAT YOU SAY THE DRIVER 
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A FORMAL 
LICENSE TO OPERATE. 
>> WELL, THE DRIVER DIDN'T HAVE 
THE FORMAL LICENSE TO OPERATE 
SO NO, IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
ON THE ROAD. 
THE VEHICLE. 
WAS IT OUTDATED? 
WAS IT IMPROPERLY FIT? 
>> THE COMPANY AND VEHICLE HAVE 
BEEN UNDER SCRUTINY WITH THE 
D.O.T. 
IN THE PAST. 
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT 
THAT. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS 
NEGLIGENCE ON SOMEONE TO ALLOW 
THIS ON THE ROAD? 
>> THAT'S PART OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> DO YOU MEAN THE DRIVER IN 
TERMS OF CRIMINAL HISTORY AND 
DRIVING HISTORY IN TERMS OF 
PREVIOUS ACCIDENTS? 
>> WE ARE NOT SAYING ANY 
INFORMATION. 
>> DID YOU GO IN AND SEES THE 
VEHICLES? 
>> YES, WE SEIZE THE VEHICLES 
BASED ON A SEARCH WARRANT 
>> HOW MANY? 
>> THREE IN ADDITION TO THE ONE 
THAT CRASHED. 
>> AND ASK LANE WHAT KIND OF 
VEHICLES THEY WERE? 
WERE THEY STRETCH LIMOS? 
>> I BELIEVE TWO WERE TOWN CAR 
STRETCH LIMOS. 
I'M NOT SURE OF THE THIRD. 
>> WHAT SEEMS REMARKABLE IS IN 
THIS CASE, YOU HAVE ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE IN THE LIMO AND TWO 
BYSTANDERS WHO ARE NOW 
DECEASED, WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN I 
IMAGINE PRETTY GOOD WITNESSES 
TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING PRIOR TO 
THE CRASH. 
YOU TALK ABOUT TEXT MESSAGES. 
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN REPORTS THAT 
PEOPLE ON THE LIMO WERE SENDING 
OUT TEXT MESSAGES, POTENTIALLY 
TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT 
WAS VERY LOUD, IT SEEMED 
UNKEMPT. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE 
LEARNING FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE 
STEPPING FORWARD OFFERING YOU 
THAT INFORMATION? 
AND, HOW CRITICAL IS THAT TO 
PUTTING THE PIECES OF THIS 
TOGETHER WITHOUT REVEALING 
WITNESSES? 
>> ALL OF THAT IS CRITICAL. 
THE BLACK BOX INFORMATION, THE 
CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION, 
INTERVIEWS, TEXT MESSAGES, 
PHOTOS. 
ANYTHING WE CAN FIND WILL PUT 
TOGETHER THE FULL PICTURE TO 
FIND OUT IF THERE IS ANY 
CRIMINAL CULPABILITY. 
>> WERE PEOPLE COMPLAINING THE 
OF THESE TEXTS THAT YOU HAVE 
SEEN THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT 
RIGHT ABOUT THIS? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
THIS. 
>> HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD YOU 
AT THIS POINT THAT THE VICTIMS 
HAD SOUGHT A BUS RATHER THAN A 
LIMO? 
>> I BELIEVE THEY TRIED TO HIRE 
A DIFFERENT VEHICLE BUT IT 
CANCELED FOR SOME REASON. 
SO, THE SUBJECT IN CHARGE OF 
THIS EXCURSION SCRAMBLED AND 
FOUND THIS COMPANY TO SATISFY 
THEIR NEEDS. 
>> DID YOU SEE THE BUS OR 
SOMETHING LARGER? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
>> WAS IT THE SAME COMPANY? 
>> NO, IT WAS NOT. 
HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH THE OWNER 
OF THE COMPANY? 
>> EXCUSE ME? 
>> HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH OLD -- 
OWNER OF THE COMPANY? 
>> WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE 
OWNER. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM THE NAME? 
>> YES. 
>> ONE AT A TIME, GUYS. 
>> IS THIS THE SAME MAN WHO WAS 
INVOLVED IN THE ALBANY CASE IN 
2004? 
>> AXES ME? 
>> HIS MR. HUSSEIN THE SAME MAN 
WHO TESTIFIED IN THE CASE 
AGAINST THE ALBANY PIZZA SHOP? 
>> I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE FBI.
>> AND YOU TELL ME ANYTHING 
ABOUT WHETHER THE DRIVER WAS 
TEXTING? 
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 
YET? 
>> THAT WILL BE PART OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> TO BE CLEAR, GOVERNOR CUOMO 
SAID THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN 
INSPECTED LAST MONTH BY THE 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
TRANSPORTATION, AND FAILED 
INSPECTION. 
SO DO YOU KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE 
OR NOT? 
>> THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN 
INSPECTED IN THE PAST AND HAS 
FAILED INSPECTIONS. 
>> CAN YOU SAY WHAT THAT WAS 
AND WHY IT FAILED? 
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO 
THE D.O.T. 
>> CAN YOU VERIFY THE OWNER IS 
STILL OUT OF THE COUNTRY? 
>> YES HE IS. 
>> DOES HE FACE CRIMINAL 
CHARGES? 
>> THAT WILL BE PART OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE WILL DETERMINE IF THERE IS 
ANY CRIMINAL CULPABILITY ON THE 
PART OF ANYONE. 
IF THERE IS, WE WILL HOLD HIM 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
>> I'M WONERING HOW THE 
AUTOPSIES, THE MEDICAL STAFF IS 
DOING, AS THEY EMBARK ON THIS. 
ARE YOU IN TOUCH WITH THEM? 
AND HOW IS THAT GOING? 
>> IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT 
INVESTIGATION FOR US TO DO. 
WE INVESTIGATE FATAL CRASHES 
ALL THE TIME, YEAR-ROUND. 
BUT THIS ONE, THE MAGNITUDE OF 
THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT FOR US. 
>> HOW ABOUT THE ROAD? 
IT COMES DOWN A BIG HILL. 
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT THE 
DANGEROUSNESS OF THAT HILL? 
>> THAT'S ALL PART OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> HOW DANGEROUS WAS IT TO PUT 
A CAR LIKE THIS ON THE ROAD? 
KNOWING THE PROBLEMS? 
>> WE WILL DETERMINE THAT. 
AND IF IT'S CRIMINAL, WE'LL 
PROSECUTE. 
>> HOW CAN A MODIFIED VEHICLE 
LIKE THIS -- 
>> THE NTSB? 
>> YEAH, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE 
-- 
>> WE ARE JUST LISTENING INTO 
NEW YORK STATE POLICE GIVING AS 
AN UPDATE ON THE ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEADLY 
CRASH THAT KILLED 20 PEOPLE ON 
SATURDAY IN SCHOHARIE, NEW 
YORK. 
WE JUST HEARD THE MAJOR SAY 
THAT THE DRIVER OF THE 
LIMOUSINE SHOULD NEVER HAVE 
BEEN ON THE ROAD,  THAT VEHICLE 
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ON THE 
ROAD. 
IT HAD FAILED INSPECTIONS JUST 
RECENTLY. 
HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT ALL OF 
THE PASSENGERS INSIDE THE 
LIMOUSINE, THEY WERE ACTIVE ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA JUST MOMENTS 
BEFORE THAT DEADLY CRASH. 
THEY ARE USING THAT 
INFORMATION, LOOKING AT THE 
TEXT MESSAGES AND THEIR POSTS 
TO SEE IF THEY CAN PIECE ALL OF 
THIS TOGETHER. 
THE MAJOR WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT 
THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY AND IF 
HE WILL FACE CRIMINAL 
PROSECUTION IF THEY FIND THAT 
HE IS AT FAULT, THEY WILL 
PROCEED WITH THAT. 
AGAIN, IT'S AN ONGOING CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION AT THIS POINT. 
20 PEOPLE WERE KILLED, AMONG 
THOSE PASSENGERS, FOUR SISTERS 
AND TWO NEWLYWEDS. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
BRING YOU THE LATEST UPDATES ON 
 
ALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
