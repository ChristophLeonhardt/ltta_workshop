WORLD. THEY ARE AMAZING, THOSE RUSSIANS THEY ARE AMAZING, THOSE RUSSIAN RUSSIANS. ON THIS SHORE SHOW, WE HAE ON THIS SHORE SHOW, WE HAC ON THIS SHORE SHOW, WE HAR ON THIS SHORE SHOW, WE HAN ON THIS SHORE SHOW, WE HAC ON THIS SHORE SHOW, WE HAE ON THIS SHORE SHOW, WE HAD THE WAR ON STANDARDS AT THE FAA WHERE RELEVANT BIOGRAPHICAL QUESTIONS WERE IMPOSED ON ASPIRING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. SADLY, THIS IS FAR FROM THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF STANDARDS DECLINING IN THE UNITED STATES. BENEATH PUBLIC VIEW, THERE IS NEVER A DEBATE ON ANY OF THIS. IT JUST HAPPENS IN SCIENTIFIC FIELDS. YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD COME UP BUT IT IS. HEATHER McDONALD HAS CHRONICLED IT IN DETAIL. HOW SCHOOLS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE CUTTING REQUIREMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO BE MORE DIVERSE, WHATEVER THAT MEANS. HEATHER MacDONALD ALSO WROTE THE UPCOMING BOOK, AND SHE JOINS US TONIGHT. HEATHER, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. WE WERE STUNNED TO FIND THAT THE FAA WAS INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO HIRE UNQUALIFIED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS BECAUSE IT'S INSANE AND DANGEROUS. BUT YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT SAME IMPULSE WOULD FIND ITS WAY INTO HARD SCIENCES, LIKE MEDICINE OR RESEARCH SCIENTISTS, BUT YOU SAY IT IS? Heather: IT'S VERY DISTURBING, TUCKER. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE POINT THAT IS FREE AND THAT'S THE IRRELEVANT CRITERIA OF RACE AND GENDER. IT'S DOING RESEARCH ON THIS AS, GET THIS, ENTER SEXUALITY. THIS IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS HAD IN MIND WHEN THEY CREATED THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION IN 1952 SPONSOR SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. WE ARE PUTTING OUR SCIENTIFIC COMPETITIVENESS AT GREAT RISK BY INTRODUCING THE TOTAL IRRELEVANCY OF RACE AND GENDER DIVERSITY INTO SCIENTIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENT. Tucker: WILL CONFUSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE LEFT BELIEVED IN SCIENCE, THEY HAD A LITTLE MARCH ANNOUNCING THAT I THINK ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. IS THERE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF RACE OR GENDER OF A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHER, FOR EXAMPLE, IS MATERIAL THAT AFFECTS THE OUTCOME OF THE EXPERIMENT IN SOME WAY? Heather: WHILE THE LEFT HATES SCIENCE WHEN IT'S PROVING FACTS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE, AND IT HATES OBJECTIVITY. THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. WE HAVE HAD 200 GRANTEES OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION THAT HAVE ONE ABOUT PRIZES. THINGS LIKE DISCOVERING DARK MATTER, DISCOVERING HOW VIRUSES WORK, AND THIS WAS WITH UTTER INDIFFERENCE. TRUE COLOR BLINDNESS, A TRUE MERITOCRACY. AND THEY CAN SEE ON THE LEFT THAT DIVERSITY MATTERS IN SCIENTIFIC THINKING. WELL, IT DOESN'T. IF THE LAB IS ALL-FEMALE, ALL ASIAN, ALL-BLACK, GREAT. ALL THE PUBLIC CARES ABOUT IS, ARE YOU WORKING TO CURE ALZHEIMER'S? THAT WE DO THAT IS BY BEING COLOR AND GENDER BLIND AND HIRING ON MERIT, NOT BASED ON GENDER. Tucker: IT'S TERRIFYING,
