University of wisconsin-milwaukee student alma dias needs to shave he also needs to practice what he preaches if he works with students for justice in Palestine and believes justice means I would have killed all the Jews in the world but I kept some to show the world why I killed them a quote he attributes to Hitler take a look wisconsin-milwaukee student u.s. is affiliated with American Muslims for Palestine a group whose former members donated twelve point four million dollars to Hamas according to information released during a 2016 congressional testimony he doesn't seem to be the most tolerant bloke either watchdog group canary mission discovered him tweeting if my son is gay I'm personally gonna go to Palestine weld me a sword come back and chop his head off what a civilized perfectly assimilated young man oh and in case those tweets didn't convince you that students for justice and palestine activists have bastardized the concept of justice and hate Jews let us clarify by answering the question what is one thing you wish you can have with justice for Palestine or kill all Zionists and responding to someone asking him who are your enemies with Jews okay but surely this hatred doesn't translate to support for actual terrorists right well us loves blowing smoke but he's totally serious when it comes to his twisted political views here's the kids response to the Israel Defense Forces tweeting that so far today more than 100 rockets fired from Gaza have hit Israel while the student graced his Twitter profile with that quote attributed to Hitler I showed at the beginning he's apparently an even bigger fan of Hamas during the 2014 Israel Gaza conflict which Hamas started by kidnapping and murdering a few Israeli teenagers it was tweeted all the brainwashed people just blame it on Hamas I think George Orwell would diagnose this fellow with stage-4 doublethink now I'm not saying this University of wisconsin-milwaukee student is all bad news he shared this hilarious video in which students are graded according to their privilege and seems to have a healthy aversion to feminists but I guess we see the left's oppression Olympics in action if an anti-feminist anti-gay guy can be accepted as long as he's pro palestine and pro hamas however disliking an ideology is one thing inciting violence against an entire religion or sexuality and defending terrorism well that's something else for campus unmasked I'm Rob shamrock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if thing happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm you
