1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,330
KENTUCKY CURRENTLY HAS ONE
ABORTION CLINIC WHERE WOMEN CAN

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,430
HAVE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
AND CARRY OUT AN ABORTION SHOULD

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,090
THEY CHOOSE TO NOT THROUGH WITH
A PREGNANCY.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,509
HOWEVER, LAWMAKERS IN KENTUCKY
ARE FIGHTING RATHER

5
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,890
AGGRESSIVELY TO SHUT THAT LAST
ABORTION CLINIC DOWN AND

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,439
THE WAY THAT THEY PLAN ON DOING
SO IS BY USING AND ENFORCING

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,800
A LAW THAT FORCES THEM TO HAVE
HOSPITAL ADMITTING PRIVILEGES.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,060
THERE ARE MANY RED STATES THAT
HAVE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT A

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,609
SIMILAR POLICY.

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:34,670
COURTS HAVE ARTIE RULED ON THIS
POLICY.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,660
NONETHELESS, THE RIGHT WING HE'S
FIGHTING ON WITH THIS.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,769
THEY MAKE THE CLAIM THAT WELL,
THIS ABORTION CLINIC NEEDS TO

13
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,820
MAKE SURE THAT IF ANYTHING GOES
WRONG WITH THIS ABORTION

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,070
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND
THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,129
ARE TREATING TO HOSPITAL.

16
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:57,769
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IN MOST
RED STATES A LOT OF THESE

17
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:01,050
HOSPITALS REFUSED TO GIVE
ADMITTING PRIVILEGES TO THE

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,380
CLINICS BECAUSE THE HOSPITALS
THEMSELVES HAVE SOME RELIGIOUS

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,710
SLANTS AND FEEL LIKE IT IS
AGAINST THEIR MORALS TO DO SO

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,370
BUT IN THIS CASE, THE ABORTION
CLINIC DID HAVE HOSPITAL

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,930
ADMITTING PRIVILEGES, IT WAS
JUST CONSIDERED INSUFFICIENT BY

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:34,240
THE GOVERNOR 

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:02:09,720
OF KENTUCKY.

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,500
LET ME BEGIN TO BREAK THAT DOWN.

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,320
1ST OF ALL, I THOUGHT
REPUBLICANS WERE AGAINST

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,630
BURDENSOME REGULATIONS.

27
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,380
IT TURNS OUT THEY LOVE THEM WHEN
IT SUITS THEIR PURPOSES.

28
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,300
I THOUGHT THEY WERE FOR SMALL
GOVERNMENT.

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
IT TURNS OUT

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,660
THEY LOVE BIG GOVERNMENT WITH
ALL THE REGULATIONS GETTING

31
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,000
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,810
YOU ARE NOT SURPRISED BY THAT.

33
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,700
2ND OF ALL, THAT IS A VERY
CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT IN

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,330
2016 SAYING LOOK, IT IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO INTERFERE

35
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,860
WITH A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO AN
ABORTION AND THE STATE OF TEXAS

36
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,481
CLEARLY AND POST AN UNDUE BURDEN
THAT INTERFERED WITH THE RIGHT

37
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:50,310
TO CHOOSE BASED ON NONSENSE OF
BURDENS BURDENSOME REGULATIONS A

38
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,050
SAID YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS
PROCEDURE AND THAT ONE WITH

39
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,370
NEARBY HOSPITALS AND YOU KNOW
WHY YOU ARE DOING THAT.

40
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,580
THE CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT
SAID YOU WERE NOT TRICKING

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,580
ANYONE.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,970
WE KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO LIMIT
ABORTIONS AND THESE ARE NOT

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,940
ACTUAL NECESSARY REGULATIONS.

44
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,090
YOU HAVE TO ENJOY THE IRONY
THAT EVEN AS CONSERVATIVE

45
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,010
SUPREME COURT SAYS IT IS
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE FOR

46
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,970
BURDENSOME UNNECESSARY
REGULATIONS.

47
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,790
NONETHELESS, KENTUCKY SAYS I DO
NOT CARE.

48
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,630
I'M GOING TO PASS THE SAME
EXACT LOT EVEN THOUGH IT GOT

49
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,330
DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL YEAR
AGO.

50
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,080
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, IT
TURNS OUT, NOTE.

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,470
THIS CLINIC WAS ACTUALLY
FOLLOWING THE RULES OF

52
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,430
KENTUCKY AND DID HAVE
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE

53
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,060
HOSPITALS EXACTLY LIKE THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO AND THEY HAVE

54
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,240
HAD THEM FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,850
MAP EVAN COMES IN AND IS LIKE I
DON'T LIKE THE LAW.

56
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,550
I AM LIKE TRUMP.

57
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,740
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE LAW, SHERIFF
JOE DOESN'T LIKE THE LAW.

58
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,850
WHEN WE DON'T LIKE BLAH WE JUST
VIOLATED.

59
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,000
HE IS LIKE THE REGULATIONS THAT
WE PREVIOUSLY SAID WERE

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,630
SUFFICIENT, NO.

61
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,570
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY NOW THEY
ARE DEFICIENT.

62
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,840
I JUST DID AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
AND A SENSE AT THE STATE

63
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,510
LEVEL SAYING THAT I AM GOING TO
IMPOSE FURTHER REGULATIONS

64
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,370
ON YOU AND THERE IS NO WAY YOU
CAN REAP MEET THEM BECAUSE

65
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,090
IT IS MY JUDGMENT CALL.

66
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,950
THEY MAKE IT INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT FOR THESE CLINICS

67
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,250
TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE
REGULATIONS AND AS SOON AS

68
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,089
THEY DO MEET THEM, THEY WILL
MAKE THEM EVEN MORE

69
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,830
STRINGENT, EVEN MORE IMPOSSIBLE
TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,789
IN THIS CASE THEY DID MEET
THE REGULATIONS.

71
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,130
EVAN COMES IN AND GOES, THAT'S
YOUR OPINION.

72
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,349
I SAY YOU DIDN'T MEET THEM.

73
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,479
SO HOW CAN I MEET THEM?

74
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,569
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU

75
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,800
IT TELLS YOU HOW DISINGENUOUS
THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,840
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THESE
PROCEDURES ARE SO DANGEROUS

77
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,350
THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE THESE
VERY SPECIFIC HOSPITALS

78
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,790
ADMITTING PRIVILEGES IN CASE OF
AN EMERGENCY.

79
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,680
NO, THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE IT AS
DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR THIS

80
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,900
ONE ABORTION CLINIC TO REMAIN
STANDING AND SO A FEDERAL JUDGE

81
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,900
HAD ARTIE RULED ON THIS AND SAID
OKAY, YOU WERE NOT ALLOWED TO

82
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,710
SHUT DOWN THIS CLINIC WHILE THIS
CASE IS PENDING AND SO A FEDERAL

83
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,389
COURT WILL MAKE A DECISION ON
THIS LEGISLATION SOON BUT

84
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,129
THE THING THAT I WANT TO BRING
UP IS IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF

85
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,810
TAXPAYER MONEY IN THE STATE OF
KENTUCKY BECAUSE AGAIN, THE

86
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,639
SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY RULED
ON THIS AND SO OKAY, YOU

87
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,819
ARE GOING TO A FEDERAL COURT.

88
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,259
YOU ARE GOING TO SPEND TAXPAYER
MONEY TO FIGHT THIS AND IN

89
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,120
THE END, IT JUST DISPLAYS OUT
THE WAY THAT IT IS SUPPOSED

90
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,169
TO, IT WILL BE FOUND AS AN UNDUE
BURDEN AND THE CLINIC WILL

91
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,460
NOT SHUT DOWN.

92
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,470
AND STOP LYING.

93
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,710
WE KNOW YOU ARE PRO-LIFE AND YOU
ADMITTED.

94
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,970
JUST SAY, I WANT TO OVERTURN ROE
VERSUS WADE.

95
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,060
I KNOW THIS IS AN ILLEGAL LAW, I
KNOW IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

96
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,319
I WANTED TO ANYWAY BECAUSE
EVERYTHING WE ARE ONCE GO

97
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,219
TO THE SUPREME COURT AND TRY
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

98
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,729
BUT YOU ARE NOT BEING HONEST
ABOUT IT.

99
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,910
INSTEAD YOU ARE NOW SAYING
YOU ARE A CHAMPION OF

100
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,159
BURDENSOME REGULATIONS.

101
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,590
IT IS A LIE.

102
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,520
YOUR REPUBLICAN CONSTITUENTS
KNOW IT'S A LIE TOO.

103
00:05:58,520 --> 00:00:00,000
GREAT, MATT BEVAN FOR FURTHER
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.
