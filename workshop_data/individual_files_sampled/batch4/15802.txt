thank you very much to everybody I want to begin by once again thanking the voters of Ontario for their support and they get their confidence is very humbling they have received this kind of mandate from the people and now the real work begins during the campaign I made a commitment I promise to deliver a government that will work for the people I promise to lead a team that is ready to govern a team that is ready to deliver our plan for the people of Ontario I promised we would be ready from day one and we have already hit the ground running last night I spoke with premier Wynne and with Andrew Horvath miss when was gracious and has promised her team's support to ensure a smooth transition as for miss Horvath I congratulated her on a hard-fought campaign I welcome the opportunity to sit down with her prior to the start of the legislature to discuss our agenda because as I said throughout the campaign I intend to lead a government for all the people later today I'll meet with the leftenant governor where I expect to receive an invitation to form Ontario's next government I've also spoken with Prime Minister Trudeau I've laid out my priorities for the people of Ontario I made a commitment to work closely with our federal partners to support them with the ongoing negotiations with our neighbors to the south and work together to deliver on our plan for the people of Ontario I told the Prime Minister that we we'll make Ontario the engine of Canada once again and what is good for Ontario is good for Canada the chair my transition team has already met with a secretary to cabinet and work on the transition of power is well underway we have begun work right away on setting up the premier's office establishing a cabinet and implementing the machinery of our new government and we are moving forward on delivering our plan for Ontario to reduce your tax bill and put more money in your pocket to clean up the hydro mess and bring down your hydro bills to create good jobs and stimulate our economy to restore accountability and Trust to cut Hospital wait times and put an end to hallway health care after a fart hard-fought campaign we know the hard work has just begun but we intend to act fast we will have much more to share with the people of Ontario in the coming days and weeks and for now I want the people of our great province to know I will do everything in my power to live up to the faith you've put in me and my team a new day has dawned in Ontario and health is here thank you well I talked to the Prime Minister yesterday I said we'll stand united against her neighbors to the south and I'm very sincere when I say that you know united we stand as a country and work hand in hand the Prime Minister and is very clear on that last night when I spoke to them and will be successful will be successful not only in Ontario but right across this country oh the only people have heard that from is the press the people out there have given me a clear mandate a very clear mandate to govern we're going to govern we have a team ready we have the best team that I've ever seen compiled in 30 years of politics and from a wide range of backgrounds diversities and a lot of a lot of different professions and we have an incredible team and we look forward to governing first of all we have to look at the books we have to see the financial situation that's been left behind and over the next couple days and weeks you're gonna hear from us and but the most important thing is getting our fiscal house in order well first of all we're gonna go out for bid for that like we're gonna do for everything and that that's gonna be very clear I don't care if it's pencils or newspapers everything's going out for bid and that wasn't the way in the past but that's the new way we're going to start respecting the taxpayers and immediately we'll be out looking for an auditing firm to go in to the province go line item by line item always always believe in third-party validation and we'll end up doing that Aesop mr. fool you talked about our getting rid of cotton trade you've talked about getting rid of captain trade how quickly do you think that that can happen how much do you expect it to cost yeah over the next few days and a couple weeks I figured the transition will take 21 days and we'll be able to answer that as we move forward we'll be putting together a group of all-star cabinet ministers not that's gonna be the toughest thing you know I we worked hard and really got to know each and every candidate and we have a group of all-stars and the toughest decision I'm gonna have to make is to put a cabinet together because in my opinion we had 123 all-stars 75 of them got elected four or five lost by 50 60 70 votes very close races and we're gonna move forward and get this province back on track and tell the world as I say you know Ontario is open for business and will they do commitments well during the election 90 IQ bender to that and I always keep my promises but again my friends what we what we have to do is sit down and talk to all 75 members of our team pick a cabinet which we'll be doing I apologize it gets the first part of your foot yes well the only people getting hurt at York University and I've met numerous students are the students you know I believe in fair negotiation and I will always expect that but there's a time that we have to move forward but again over the next day or weeks when is it possible where we're going to look at all options and been in touch with some of the folks there and we're gonna lay everything on the table and try to get that ended as soon as possible because the only people again that are getting hurt here are the students and we want to put a quick end to this mr. Ford County chronic alley was here last night and one of the things that she had said was that she wants to see the sex ed curriculum repealed in time to the school year again September will you do that you said that you want to repeal the sex act or to the replace it with something else will you do it in time for kids who are going to be going back to school this September well again I'll sit down with our new cabinet and with the Minister of Education discuss that with them but I can tell you one thing we're repealing it I'll tell you another thing we keep our promises what we say we're gonna do we're gonna do we aren't going to flip-flop we have a clear mandate from the people and we want to make sure that over the next four years our mandate gets fulfilled based on the people voting us in mr. Ford was a victory mr. Ford was the victory a little less sweet last night knowing that Renata couldn't share in it Oh again my friends that's that's something that will talk about the future and our family was there it was it was great I was so happy my my mother is there and I know a lot of and my dad we're looking down on us and I give a lot of credit the rob for the reason I'm standing here today but we're going to have a great team and we're gonna move forward with our with our team and I look forward to talking to you days and weeks ahead and I'm going to be sitting down a few outlets today but again my I want to thank you for coming and you have all the access you
