like all right no more no more got my mind set on you sorry we're just it really excited it's Friday we've been singing some sound of music up in here some 80s tunes up in here in time you Leisha crowd I'm Michael Knowles and you are watching Friday live we have lots to cover but first maybe we're kind of in the mood to sing because we're talking about the late great amazingly God gifted talent of Aretha Franklin or ESP ICT oh yeah a little behind the scenes here at the daily where the control room is behind us and you need to show them some respect because that's what's hanging on their door right now you got to be nice and quiet when you want SS to just uh Sharpton does not have a good relationship with any teleprompter for the English language right the first time this happened but it is always hilarious so recap of some of the audience responses on their favorite Aretha Franklin songs our very own Jared says that say little pray for you pray for you that's favorite some of our fans agree with him as well Santos an on YouTube says you make me feel like a natural woman Carlo Carlotta says you're no good heartbreaker hey Bea it's me on youtube says respect of course probably her most well-known song somebody on instagram named Powell Powell pawg oh yeah I don't know who you are son but you said you hadn't heard from her or about her like you didn't know who she was I don't believe it I think you're trying to be funny but not funny show some respect anyway JW also says respect mad Nadder on youtube says do right woman do right man Tammy Carlos said chain of fools oh that's a good one our era era mine on Instagram says son of a preacher man also one of my favorites Maurice did agree with Jerrod she says I say a little prayer for you Arthur says bridge over troubled water and rosemary also pointed out another one I forgot about that I've been listening to all week long you send me oh you send me is good there are better versions of that song but her version is very good you know I'd like her version the best really yeah version so it was good so go back how many weeks in a row do you think we can talk about Stephen Tyler I know that's he's really just trying to hop in here this one is clearly a setup right do you think yes have you heard we have this tweet that Austin's gonna put up right now from Steven Tyler because he has decided that he doesn't want Trump and had actually sent a cease and desist letter yes but he does not want president Trump using his songs at his rallies the rally that you and Cassie stayed late to watch the other night that you guys were live tweeting out and he released this tweet of course that we are showing this is this is not about Dems versus Republican my music is for causes not for political campaigns or rallies protecting copyright and songwriters is what I've been fighting for even before this current administration took office so we've seen this happen in the past I remember Green Day said hey we don't want you using our songs to Bush pink has said things like that to Republican can right ok it's it's so absurd you know Steven Tyler just demands attention at all times so you know he got in trouble cuz he pushed that fan out of the way and now he did this thing's obviously contrived stunts where he jumped in with a street performer and started singing his songs and he's sending these notes to trump but like look man his heyday might have been behind him it's that's like just go on tour have a good life you've got a your fans love you you've made a lot of money calm down I do think that the singing with the street artist was trying to like kind of buy a back and be like look I'm nice but you know the first thing that jumped out to me had it this other stuff had not happened then I would have believed it more he just likes things when it's about him yeah he seems kind of like a narcissist yeah and by the way the other thing is with this don't play my songs at your rallies yeah the best way to ensure that Donald Trump does something is to tell them not to do it that is the way you guarantee wanting actually wanting then those then people like you go to iTunes and buy a song Trump rallies are the biggest TV events every time they go up he probably just wants the publicity okay so our poll question this week if you head over to Instagram and it's live on Facebook right now would you let us celeb you hated use your art so if you were famous artiste would you let a celebrity or you know or even a politician or something that you didn't like use your art yea or nay yeah of course I mean you can you can whine and moan about it but you can't actually stop them that's the other thing I mean you send these cease and desist season desist means nothing you know I mean that's like an empty empty motivation but you know you make the art let the art live in the world to let it give if the art is not going to jive with the political message of a candidate then it will just be absurd yeah then why it'll just look ridiculous on its face stand by your art I do think it was kind of funny that after he won the Republican nomination now he still plays a song all the time Donald Trump plays The Rolling Stones can't always get what you want yeah that's that's exactly my thoughts on it when those balloons were dropping on him the whole clan yeah that was Craig Gray on a much more serious note though we found out today I think Fox News when the first with the breaking news a statement from Senator John McCain's family that he has decided not to continue treatment for his glioblastoma glioblastoma tumor that he has it's the same thing actually that Senator Ted Kennedy and former Vice President Joe Biden son Beau Biden you know died fighting so a lot of people are thinking that potentially this is just his way of saying hey I'm done doing treatment I want to live out my final days with friends and family and not be constantly you know poked and prodded and all this well he hasn't been in Washington in many months and he's been hanging out with his friends everyone thought he would be dead by March he is stuck around a lot longer he's obviously a fighter yeah yeah so he's lived a long life he's accomplished the things he wants to accomplish it's a good way to go you can't wish for much more than that Cindy McCain and of course his eldest daughter or I'm sorry his middle daughter Megan McCain released statements saying that they are so grateful and god bless all of the people that have been helping take care of him during this time Megan McCain's tweet says that her family is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity that you've shown us during this past year thank you for all of your continued support in prayer we could not have made it this far without you you've given us the strength to carry on I believe that the view is on hiatus until October so presumably Megan will be heading out there with the rest of Senator McCain's job Steve you can stay on hiatus until next October the following October and they're actually adding another conservative Abby honey I know she's leaving Fox and Friends about she's leaving Fox and Friends weekend and headed over there so it's the first time that two conservative gals will be on the on the panel aware so that should be interesting so our thoughts and prayers to the McCain family and you know whether you agree or disagree with Senator McCain that man definitely follows the courage of his convictions and and has been murdered and there is an aspect conservatives have always had a hard time with John McCain because he's not conservative and so there is this issue it one must remember the guy does have a wife and children and people who are friends with him and love him so you one has to respect that aspect even if you don't agree with much of his political career my mama would say if you have nothing nice to say then don't say it at all yeah or at least wait to say it that's what I would if you have nothing nice to say and it's a your job is kind of right yeah but you should at least wait there's a time in a place one can be appropriate you know the left is so humorless and they celebrate when people die people you know on the right one awful lady that danced on like literally was like this is me pretending to dance on Barbara Bush it's great you're right right that's it don't be that I don't need to be that you don't be like a leftist you can yeah you can wait for your criticism for a week or two let's do that please so Roger Federer he actually just got out of his contract with Nike because he signed a 300 million dollar deal with this Japanese a barrel company called Uniqlo made some cold yeah so he was at an event in New York City TMZ cameras caught him coming out of this Uniqlo event with all of his fans and they asked him if he thought that if he could beat Serena Williams in a match one-on-one and he said I think he had the very diplomatic thought cuz John McEnroe awhile ago had gotten in trouble for some of the stuff that he had been bragging about and he said I would hope so yes well this is amazing because it shouldn't even be a news story but we're in this culture right now that believes that men and women are are physically the same any male tennis player would absolutely destroy the the Williams sisters without question there's a great example of this every so often they do these battle of the sexes kind of things this is from Virginia battle of the sexes the original battle Billie Jean King actually said she doesn't think that Serena could meet you meet some of the top guys say by the way all respect to Serena you know she had had some beef with John McEnroe because he said she would only rank like seven hundredths yeah and I'm like no me things she'd definitely be in the top hundred she wouldn't here's why really yeah so they've done all of these battles of the sexes over many years and the women always get destroyed because the male tennis player because male tennis and female tennis are just different games with different bodies during the 1998 Australia open this is from some tennis website the Williams sisters said they could beat any man ranked outside the top 200 so this challenge was accepted by a guy named Carsten Brosh a German player ranked number 203 before the matches he was playing both of them in one day a Brosh played a round of golf in the morning drank a couple of beers smoked a few cigarettes and then played the Williams sisters for a set each one after the other he beat Serena six to one he beat Venus six to two Serena said afterward I didn't know it would be that hard I hit shots that would have been winners on the women's tour and he got to them easily so the thing is not even the Williams sisters say years ago though I know they were younger and in better shape serena is a much smarter and more accomplished player now all these years later have you watched the documentary about her it's so she her like her regimen her dedication her hard work as my heart goes out to hers like she's a professional mom and she's talked a lot about how when you're a mom there's sometimes things and decisions and you miss things as a mother you miss things professionally I mean look at the French Open because she had quote quote-unquote taken off to have a kid they weren't gonna write their ranking her against beginner players and she had to work her way up the tally plus she won the Australian Open while pregnant but nobody is questioning that the question is can win women tennis players beat male tennis players and me I don't think Serena Williams is the number one or an Open winner could beat the male Open winner but I think to pooh-pooh like John but she couldn't beat the number 203 she lost one that was 20 years ago when she was a an inexperienced rookie I think today she would definitely beat that guy who by the way where is he who is he nobody knows about him right he's still right exactly and she is much more famous even though she's a much worse tennis player oh my god I'm just saying and they're like different we have this obsession in our culture right now I have to pretend but men and women are physically equally strong and that's just absurd I'm not a part of that obsession I'm not saying you're just like third I'm not saying it's like slightly like she would be number four and not be number one I'm saying she would be like number four hundred isn't that in common I think she'd be in the top 50 I mean all every single time this has ever been tried it that has been known and the last time you have was twenty years ago when she was one of these specifically Serena oh yeah I don't know I mean yes she does obviously she learned her lesson it doesn't do it any she admitted that she did one if she once told the late-night host to her credit even though John McEnroe said she'll break because 750 were there she said I don't know maybe I'd be around 200 yeah so pretty banggood I don't know because she lost at 203 dramatically so like I don't buy that at all it's absurd this is no knock on Serena Williams she is great at what she does but what she does is different than what male tennis players she's also in a really good new commercial and it's like mama gonna knock you out it's good advertising and I was like yeah mama is you go through that you go we go you go i'ma roar this is my two weeks notice I'm moving to the Bay Area and I'm starting a new career oh there's a lot of opportunities up there a lot of opportunities including a hundred and 85 grand a year folks but I mean first of all actually I'll rescind that yeah that uh you know two weeks notice because one bay is super expensive and two turns out I just found out it's for the San Francisco poop Patrol oh yes well that's talked about a bad job I'll use I'll choose my language carefully yeah there's children not a great job that this is true so there's this new job you know they decriminalized defecating in public in San Francisco that's that forget the matter is there right you know talk about Silicon Valley all these techno futurists they are wallowing in their own filth on the street this is not the future it's the filth of the tech people unless they're into some weird Merliah they are but they are permitting it and they're enabling it you know when they hand out the heroin needles let's know yeah like what did that needle picker-uppers get they should get a lot more because they're almost more at risk for getting these people whose job it is to pick up and supervise the pickup of actual human waste on the street they're being offered one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars a year cost benefits yeah it's a government job it's probably great in 20 years they're they're gonna be a part of the pension liability problem we have here this this post is the real really hot question it for $185,000 would you make your entire job to pick up human excrement on the street I can't say no I mean like frankly my role at the Daily wire I occasionally feel an analogy to just picking up at least politically I have to pick up the excrement of politics yeah I broadcast from the broom closet yeah 185 grand a year I mean why not I know so that's our question to you would you pick up poo for a hundred and eighty five grand a year I actually am thinking of this more long term you know how every year on Mother's Day they come up with the amount of money that a stay-at-home mom would make were she to do all those tasks in the world world I mean it's always like a 7 million aging yeah totally like changing diapers 185 grand is this gonna affect that that I always I always sort of roll my eyes when they like they try to break it down they say really women should make 7 zillion dollars yeah sure but then you realize if you get 185 K for picking up excrement that those numbers are true the women actually if they stay at home they should make like 50 million dollars a year there you go that's unbelievable those diapers divide out like the 12 children children potty training breastfeeding making the food cleaning the house you go moms that's the gist of today's Friday life you go I can't wait for you in sweet little Lisa to have lovely darling Knowles challenge I know I can't send them off to boarding school British I want her to come to a Friday life and you just stay at home with the kids birthday Oh to see if you make it I'm not a very nurturing fella I don't I don't know if that's guy want to be like a very British father you know have them very aloof just bring me my slippers and pipe at night it was just int yeah that's exactly right you know okay I kind of want to just be a grandfather slip the kid like 50 bucks when he sees me just go fly a kite with them all right guys I know we're Craig Craig we're out of here okay we'll see you next week and don't forget to answer that poll question would you pick up poo for three point four six figures I mean yeah yeah mid six figures I mean 185 gay that's not nothing all right we'll see you next week you
