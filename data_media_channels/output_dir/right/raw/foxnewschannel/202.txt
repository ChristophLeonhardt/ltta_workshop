00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,174
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,208
WE ARE CONTINUING OUR FOCUS ON

4
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:12,911

00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,584
VITAL RACES.

8
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:21,553
TONIGHT IT'S TENNESSEE AND

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:26,391
INDIANA ON SWAMP WATCH.

10
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,593
>> THIS KAVANAUGH INFORMATION

11
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:31,229
SEEM TO HAVE FIRED UP MANY ON

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,402
BOTH SIDES.

13
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:38,303
ONE OF THEM WAS TAYLOR SWIFT

14
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,304
WHO PLUNGED INTO THE FRAY WITH

15
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:39,904
HER FIRST-EVER POLITICAL

16
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:40,305
ENDORSEMENT.

17
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,973
SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY VOTE FOR

18
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,808
MARSHA BLACKBURN IN HER HOME

19
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,645
STATE SENATE RACE, VOTE FOR

20
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,614
DEMOCRAT PHIL BRINSON SHE TOLD

21
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,017
HER INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS.

22
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,085
DIDN'T ANYONE TELL HER ABOUT

23
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:56,855
HIS RECORD ON SEXUAL

24
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:57,956
HARASSMENT.

25
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,725
THIS IN DORTMUND MIGHT END UP

26
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:01,693
WITH TEARDROPS ON HER GUITAR.

27
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:06,031
WHILE SERVING AS GOVERNOR OF

28
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:10,035
TENNESSEE.

29
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:10,435
[INAUDIBLE]

30
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:11,770
WORSE THIS LOBBYIST WAS

31
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,205
SUSPENDED FOR WORKPLACE

32
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:17,475
HARASSMENT.

33
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:18,610
WHEN LOCAL REPORTERS BEGAN

34
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,277
INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT

35
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,278
THEY WERE SHOCKED TO FIND

36
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:21,746
STATE INVESTIGATORS HAD

37
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:22,414
LITERALLY SHREDDED ALL THE

38
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,816
NOTES THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN

39
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,118
DURING AN INTERNAL

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:27,552
INVESTIGATION.

41
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:28,586
THE TOP INVESTIGATOR

42
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:29,921
REPORTEDLY ADMITTED TO BEING

43
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,389
KEENLY AWARE THAT

44
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,824
DOCUMENTATION WOULD HAVE BEEN

45
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,762
LATER REQUESTED AS PUBLIC

46
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,097
RECORD.

47
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,599
THEY ARGUED IT WAS ALL PART OF

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,400
AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE

49
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,402
IDENTITY OF THE VICTIMS

50
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,237
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS REALLY CARE

51
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:46,704
UP THAT.

52
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:50,175
JUST ASK DIANNE FEINSTEIN.

53
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,609
THEN THE GOVERNOR TOLD

54
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,111
REPORTERS UPTIME THERE'S

55
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:59,250
NOTHING TO BE COVERED UP HERE

56
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,351
BUT THEY SAID I DON'T HAVE ANY

57
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:01,186
WAY OF PROVING THAT TO YOU.

58
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:01,886
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

59
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:08,993
KIND OF HAVE TO.

60
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:11,529
HE RESIGNED AMID SEXUAL

61
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,933
HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.

62
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:15,567
THE GOVERNOR CONFIRMED A

63
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:21,072
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION FROM

64
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:21,739
2004 BUT SAID INVESTIGATORS

65
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,474
FOUND NO CORROBORATION OF THE

66
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:22,807
CLAIMS.

67
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:23,541
GUESS WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE

68
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:23,975
NOTES?

69
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:24,909
THEY WERE SHREDDED TWO.

70
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,011
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT DEMOCRATS

71
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:27,679
WOULD'VE SAID IF THIS HAD

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,148
HAPPENED WITH BRET CAVANAGH

73
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:34,018
QUEST MARK OH,  WE DIDN'T

74
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:34,686
INVESTIGATION INTO CHRISTINE

75
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,420
FORD'S ALLEGATION BUT WE CAN'T

76
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,087
TELL YOU ABOUT THEM BECAUSE

77
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:38,089
SOMEONE SHREDDED AND

78
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,890
OUTSPREAD.

79
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,492
SURELY THEY WOULD BE SHREDDING

80
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,259
WHOEVER SAID THIS.

81
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,697
AT THE TIME OF THE TENNESSEE

82
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,331

86
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,370

GUESS WHO SAID THAT?

91
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,944
NONE OTHER THAN TAYLOR SWIFT

92
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,147

100
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,560
GOOD IDEA FOR HER NOT TO
