1
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:12,906
TOP STORY.

2
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:15,942
AT PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN

3
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:18,011
NETANYAHU SAYS THAT HE HAS PILES

4
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:20,647
OF PROOF THAT IRAN HAS CONTINUED

5
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:24,517
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

6
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:26,720
THEY SAY THEY HAVEN'T.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,988
MICHAEL IS HERE WITH US TODAY.

8
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,258
HE SERVED AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN

9
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:34,994
TEL AVIV AND NOW HE'S AT THE

10
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,396
WASHINGTON INSTITUTE.

11
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:37,097
HI, MICHAEL.

12
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:38,665
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEP.

13
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,100
>> Shepard: HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,700
NEW, FIRST?

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,335
>> IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MUCH OF IT

16
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:43,203
MIGHT BE NEW.

17
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:46,272
HE SAID THERE'S 100,000

18
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:46,773
DOCUMENTS.

19
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:48,441
OBVIOUSLY SOME TIME WOULD BE

20
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:49,909
REQUIRED IF IT'S NOT ALREADY

21
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:51,845
DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO SIFT

22
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:52,946
THROUGH THAT TO SEE WHAT WE

23
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:53,913
ALREADY DIDN'T KNOW.

24
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:55,982
A LOT OF IT LOOKS FAMILIAR.

25
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:58,251
THE IDEA THAT IRAN WAS NOT

26
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,719
EXACTLY FORTHCOMING ABOUT THEIR

27
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,855
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IN THE

28
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:06,559
PAST IS NOT NEW TO U.S. POLICY

29
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:06,893
MAKERS.

30
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,261
>> Shepard: AND YET THE UNITED

31
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:09,596
STATES PEOPLE SAY THAT THE

32
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:11,898
INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS ARE

33
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:13,600
GETTING THEIR JOB DONE AND IRAN

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,801
IS COMPLYING WITH THE DEAL.

35
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,469
WHAT WOULD THE CONSEQUENCES BE

36
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,638
OF BACKING OUT OF THAT?

37
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:21,141
>> JUST ONE QUICK POINT ON THE

38
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:21,541
FIRST PART.

39
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,376
THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED BY THE

40
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:24,477
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

41
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:25,512
IRAN'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE DEAL,

42
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:26,946
BUT IT'S THE DEAL ITSELF.

43
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:28,815
IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

44
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,817
IRAN WASN'T REQUIRED TO REALLY

45
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:32,519
COME CLEAN ON THIS PAST NUCLEAR

46
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,320
WEAPONS WORKING TO ADMIT IT.

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,955
THAT'S STOPPED INSPECTORS FROM

48
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:36,890
ESTABLISHING A BASELINE FOR

49
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,025
THEIR INSPECTION ACTIVITIES.

50
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:41,094
IF THE U.S. PULLS OUT, IN A

51
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:42,395
SENSE WE'RE STARTING FROM

52
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,596
SCRATCH.

53
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,398
WE'LL TRY TO REVIVE THAT

54
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,134
ECONOMIC PRESSURE THROUGH

55
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:50,036
SANCTIONS WHICH EXISTED BEFORE

56
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:51,337
THE DEAL.

57
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:53,440
PRIVATE SECTOR FIRMS WILL HAVE

58
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,041
NO CHOICE TO COMPLY IF IT'S I

59
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,543
RAN AND THE UNITED STATES

60
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,178
MARKETS BUT WE'LL BE DOING IT

61
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:00,213
WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF OUR

62
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:02,115
PARTNERS THAT WILL BE UPSET

63
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:02,816
ABOUT IT.

64
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,618
>> Shepard: THOSE PARTNERS

65
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:08,221
INCLUDING UNITED KINGDOM AND

66
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:10,857
GERMANY WHO WERE JUST -- AND

67
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:12,625
FRANCE WHO WERE JUST HERE.

68
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,961
THEY SEEM INTENT OKAY, WE CAN

69
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,229
WORK ON OTHER THINGS.

70
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:17,797
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS DEAL STICK.

71
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:18,331
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

72
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,600
THE BASIC BARGAIN IN THE TRUMP

73
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,868
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN DRIVING

74
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:24,237
AT, WE'LL STICK WITH THE DEAL,

75
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,973
WE'LL STAY IN THE JCPOA IF YOU

76
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,976
GUYS WORK WITH US TO NUMBER 1

77
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:31,478
CORRECT ITS FLAWS AND THAT'S

78
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:32,879
FLAWS LIKE SOME OF THOSE WE'RE

79
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,414
TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND ADDRESS

80
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:37,617
IRAN'S ACTIVITIES MORE BROADLY

81
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,718
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

82
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,920
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD BARGAIN IF

83
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,754
WE CAN GET IT.

84
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,623
IF WE CAN'T GET IT, IT RAISES

85
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,124
OTHER QUESTIONS.

86
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,459
WITHDRAWING AND THROWING ALL

87
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,262
THAT WORK OUT DOESN'T SEEM VERY

88
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:49,562
WISE.

89
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,499
>> THE DEMONSTRATION THAT PRIME

90
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:57,070
MINISTER NETANYAHU REMINDED ME

91
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:57,470
AGO.

92
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,541
IF TRUE, IF WHOEVER WAS GOT THE

93
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,742
DOCUMENTS AND THEY ARE WHAT THE

94
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:04,711
PRIME MINISTER SAYS WHAT THEY

95
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:07,647
ARE, ARE YOU IMPRESSED BY THAT?

96
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,582
>> WELL, CERTAINLY.

97
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:11,518
JUST THE INTELLIGENCE FEAT

98
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:14,053
ITSELF IS VERY IMPRESSIVE, THIS

99
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:15,622
IS A REAL COUP.

100
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:18,324
THE ISRAELIS DESERVE A LOT OF

101
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,325
COMMENDATION FOR THAT.

102
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,059
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANYBODY

103
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:22,362
IN THIS TROVE, WHICH IS

104
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,263
SUBSTANTIALLY NEW AND MORE

105
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:24,564
IMPORTANTLY WHETHER IT SHOWS ANY

106
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,065
OF THIS WORK IS I DON'T KNOW

107
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,901
GOING, WHICH WOULD BE THE

108
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,836
SMOKING GUN IS REALLY THE KEY

109
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,203
QUESTION.

110
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:31,738
WE HAVE TO DIG INTO THAT AND

111
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:33,740
PROBABLY FOLLOW UP WITH

112
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,108
INTERNATIONAL INSPECTIONS AS

113
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:35,408
WELL.

114
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:36,142
>> Shepard: HOW CONCERNED ARE

115
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:39,112
YOU WITH TENSIONS AS RELATES TO

116
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:41,915
SYRIA, IRAN AND ISRAEL?

117
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:44,317
CONOR POWELL IS A LONG-TIME

118
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:46,219
WORKED THERE, SOUNDED FROM HIS

119
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,921
TONE LIKE WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.

120
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,389
>> I CAN TELL YOU FROM WHAT I

121
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:51,157
UNDERSTAND, THE ISRAELIS ARE

122
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,525
WORRIED ABOUT IT AND WE SHOULD

123
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,994
ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT IT.

124
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:57,897
THE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN TRYING

125
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:06,439
HARD TO BEEF UP THEIR MILITARY

126
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:06,806
PRESENCE.

127
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:08,942
THE ISRAELIS SAID THAT'S NOT

128
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:10,109
TOLERABLE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE

129
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,978
ONE DAY THAT IRAN COULD HAVE

130
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:15,081
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THEN YOU

131
00:04:15,081 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION WITH
