OUT POLITICALLY. Bill: THE ECONOMY IS COOKING. Julie: BACK TO ONE OF OUR TOP STORIES, FORMER F.B.I. ATTORNEY JAMES BAKER SOON TO REAPPEAR BEFORE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FOR ANOTHER HIGH STAKES HEARING. HE WILL FACE TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN AND THE WIRETAP CLAIMS. LET'S BRING IN CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN WHO WILL BE IN THAT ROOM ASKING QUESTIONS TODAY. CONGRESSMAN ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU. I SHOULD NOTE THAT IT'S INTERESTING TO MAKE NOTE THAT BAKER HAD A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP TO JAMES COMEY BEFORE HE LEFT THE BUREAU. YOU'LL BE IN TODAY'S CLOSED DOOR MEETINGS. WHAT QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE FOR JAMES BAKER? WHERE WE START IS ANDREW MCCABE, LISA PAGE MET WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN WHERE MR. ROSENSTEIN SAID HE WAS THINKING ABOUT ACTUALLY RECORDING THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IN THE OVAL OFFICE, RECORDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. RIGHT AFTER THAT MEETING MR. MCCABE AND MIZ PAGE TALK TO JIM BAKER AND HE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY. WAS THERE A LEGAL ANALYSIS LOOKING TO RECORD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS TOOK PLACE? THOSE ARE THE FIRST SERIES OF QUESTIONS WE'LL ASK MR. BAKER. THEN A HOST OF OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO GET TO AS WELL. Julie: RIGHT. SO IN JUST ABOUT 30 MINUTES FROM NOW YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. HE WILL BE TESTIFYING AFTER SOME EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY YESTERDAY WHERE HE BASICALLY CALLED THE RUSSIA PROBE BEING HANDLED IN AN ABNORMAL FASHION AND ALSO MENTIONED THAT IT REFLECTED POLITICAL BIAS. THAT'S A QUOTE. THIS IS NO SURPRISE. I'M NOT SURE IF DEMOCRATS SEEM SURPRISED BY THIS GIVEN THE PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE TEXTS. IS POLITICAL BIAS ENOUGH TO DERAIL THE MUELLER PROBE? I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING THAT YESTERDAY ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" AND DO AN INTERVIEW WHERE HE SAYS THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION APPROPRIATE AND MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND YET I CAN'T COME TALK TO CONGRESS ABOUT THE IDEA THAT HE MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT RECORDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? ROSENSTEIN IS THE GUY WHO PICKED MUELLER IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART. YOU HAVE TIME FOR AN INTERVIEW WHERE YOU SAY THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS APPROPRIATE AND INDEPENDENT BUT YOU CAN'T ANSWER CONGRESS ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID IN A MEETING AT THE HEAD OF THE DEPUTY F.B.I. WHEN HE WAS ACTING HEAD OF THE F.B.I. BECAUSE MR. COMEY WAS FIRED BY THE MEMO YOU WROTE. THE FACT THAT HE WAS A NO SHOW LAST WEEK IS NOT RIGHT. HE IS OBLIGATED WHEN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER YOUR AGENCY ASKS YOU TO COME TO CONGRESS AND TESTIFY YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO IT UNDER OATH AND HE WAS A NO SHOW BUT HAS TIME TO TALK TO THE PRESS ABOUT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. GIVE ME A BREAK. Julie: HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" DEFENDS THE MUELLER PROBE CALLS IT APPROPRIATE AND INDEPENDENT PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO BE FRUSTRATED. I CAN ACCEPT THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE THE CASES WE BROUGHT WERE WARRANTED BY THE EVIDENCE AND IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF RESOURCES. I HAVE A SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE CASES ARE PURSUED AND PROSECUTED AND PLEASED THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. IF YOU GOT A CHANCE TO INTERVIEW ROSENSTEIN WHAT WOULD YOU ASK HIM? TALK ABOUT FRUSTRATING. WHY HASN'T HE GIVEN US THE MCCABE MEMOS WE SUB AOEN ADD AND THE 302 FROM BRUCE OHR AND OPEN THE FISA APPLICATION THAT CHAIRMAN NUNES TALKED ABOUT AND AN UPDATE FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEY LOOKING INTO THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE F.B.I. WE DON'T GET ALL THAT INFORMATION THAT WE'RE ENTITLED TO GET AS A SEPARATE AND EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND HE IS A NO SHOW AND GLENN SIMPSON TAKES THE FIFTH. WE'RE FRUSTRATED. I WANT HIM TO COME IN TO ANSWER LOTS OF QUESTIONS LIKE ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTS WE HAVE OUTSTANDING BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH ANDY MCCABE WHERE HE SAID HE WAS THINKING OF RECORDING THE PRESIDENT. Julie: GOOD LUCK THIS
