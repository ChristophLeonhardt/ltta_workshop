okay that's it I can't take it anymore if I hear the words Grenfell one more time I will take a fridge and detonate it in my own mouth just to make the voices go away if you were in a coma yesterday you may have missed the endless coverage of the first anniversary of the Grenville tower fire as I stood next to the smoldering remains of the tower block the morning after the fire neighbors told me that about 200 people must have died in that block our government could only emit 272 because it was a bit awkward for them to fess up to the fact we don't have a clue who the hell's in our country the fire was supposed to have been started by a fridge in the middle of the night during Ramadan I can't imagine what caused a fire during Ramadan after the Sun went down but since the same model of fridge and since being passed as perfectly safe to use it's a mystery but one thing I do know is that the sick if antic coverage across the state broadcaster for grenfell was bloody exhaustive it banged on longer than Bishop curry at the Royal Wedding clearly any loss of life is tragic but it seems that some tragedies are more tragic than others public buildings were lit up green for Grenville because since the Islamist terror attacks in our country we've really nailed this illumination lock and politicians desperately try to out grief each other these are the grief vultures picking over the bones of the genuine sadness of many for votes I'm the champion of the victims no I am no watch me cry more korban Khan may celebrities desperate to signal their pro migrate globalist cred you may not be aware that the 14th of June is Liberation Day in the Falkland Islands memory of those who lost their lives during the conflict and in celebration of the British troops who came to the rescue of Falkland Islanders 36 years ago 255 brave men lost their knives you may ask where were the buildings lit red white and blue where were the reports where were the leaders of this world's great great country where were the leaders of this once great country I'll tell you we're chasing votes and approval just as Theresa Mayes stomach-churning script read today for Eid Mubarak makes her look like a hostage in al-qaeda's grasp I swear I saw an orange jumpsuit reflected on her clammy forehead blink three times if you're being held against your will Theresa where was your exaggerated script person george's day nuff where was the gurning and the foe animation for the english this is an appeasement of the worst order and an erosion of our identity and what it means to be British we're on bended knee to Islam and gripped by this mandatory multiculturalism that prizes diversity above national pride our leaders our supplicant acquiescing and diluting anything that allows us to identify as british but 20 million bricks or more have had enough we are proud of our heritage and those who fought for our freedom and our history under Thatcher we will fly the flag of st. George this world cup and whilst our so-called leaders shed tears for votes or read bizarre scripts to appease the Muslim massive We the People stand strong for Britain we are a hundred percent viewer-supported if you can help us cover any the costs of our travel or expenses please donate at Hopkins worldcom you
