Laura: I THOUGHT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE ORGANIZED CRIME OUT OF THE POT BUSINESS. NEWS FLASH, IT IS NOT. A STARTLING REPORT FROM NBC NEWS THIS MORNING REVEALS THAT FOREIGN CARTELS EMBRACE HOMEGROWN MARIJUANA AND POT-LEGAL STATES. THE REASON IS SIMPLE. ACCORDING TO COLORADO SHERIFF BILL ELDER THEY HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS EASIER TO GROW AND PROCESS MARIJUANA IN COLORADO AND THEN SHIP IT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES THAN IT IS TO BRING IT IN FROM MEXICO OR CUBA. FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY THE CHINESE, CUBAN AND MEXICAN DRUG RATES HAVE PURCHASED OR RENTED HUNDREDS OF HOMES IN CALIFORNIA, COLORADO AND WASHINGTON WHERE LACKS POT LAWS PROVIDE COVER FOR CARTEL. IS IT TIME TO ADMIT THAT LEGALIZED POT HAS FAILED? HERE TO DEBATE THE QUESTION IS MASON, A SPOKESMAN AT THE MARIJUANA POLICY PROJECT. JOINING US FROM DENVER. MASON, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. THIS IS PRETTY WILD. WE HAVE CHINESE, CUBAN, AND MEXICAN MAFIA/CARTEL FOLKS RENTING PROPERTIES IN COLORADO AND CALIFORNIA. TO GET THEIR PRODUCTS OUT. HOW IS THIS GOOD FOR THE STATES WERE POT WAS LEGALIZED? THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN EVERY STATE AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR DECADES AND NOW IN STATES LIKE COLORADO AND WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA, WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THAT THE DEMAND AMONGST THE POPULATION IN THOSE STATES IS BEING MET BY A NEW LEGAL MARKET WHERE THE PRODUCT IS BEING CONTROLLED, IT'S BEING GROWN AND SOLD BY LICENSED BUSINESSES AND BECAUSE THERE IS STILL THAT DEMAND IN THESE OTHER STATES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLING MARIJUANA, PEOPLE ARE STILL PRODUCING IT. Laura: COME ON. MASON, THEY ARE ABLE TO UNDERCUT THE EXPENSE I'VE BROWSED IN SOME OF THOSE STORES IN COLORADO. INFUSED LAVENDER-INFUSED EDIBLES. THIS STUFF IS EXPENSIVE. THE CARTELS CAN COME IN, RENT THESE PLACES, UNDERCUT THE LEGAL POT AND SOMETIMES A LOT MORE POTENT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND A LOT MORE DANGEROUS. THEY FLOOD THE MARKET WITH THAT, UNDERCUTTING LEGAL POT, NOT CAUSING IT TO BE A PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE SHOPPING FOR MARIJUANA. Laura: I'M NOT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WAS SEEING WITH ALL THE STONERS WERE BUYING. THE FACT IS YOU CAN BUY MARIJUANA FOR THE SAME OR LOWER OF A RATE THEN YOU COULD ON THE STREET. NO ONE IS GOING OUT AND CALLING AROUND TO ILLEGAL DRUG DEALERS ARE TRYING TO GET IT ON THE STREET CORNER. IMAGINE IF ALCOHOL WAS BEING SOLD ILLEGALLY. Laura: I GET YOUR POINT. LET'S HEAR WHAT COLORADO LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTUALLY ON THE FRONT LINES HERE, WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL LEGALIZATION EXPERIMENT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT WE COME ACROSS IN THESE ROADS ARE CUBAN NATIONALS. THEY ARE ORGANIZED DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS WHO COME TO COLORADO TO GROW THEIR MARIJUANA. COLOMBIA'S TO COCAINE AS COLORADO IS TO MARIJUANA. DO YOU THINK THE STATE IS TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THAT? I THINK THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY TURNING A BLIND EYE. THIS EXPERIMENT HAS FAILED AND I URGE ANY STATE THAT IS THINKING ABOUT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA TO LEARN BY OUR MISTAKES. DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN IN OTHER STATES. Laura: FINAL THOUGHT FROM YOU VERY QUICKLY? CARTELS AND TRAINEES DRUG RINGS ARE NOT RENTING OUT SUBURBS HOUSES TO BOOTLEG IT AROUND THE COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTS LETTING STATES ESTABLISH THEIR OWN POLICIES AND IS WORKING WITH
