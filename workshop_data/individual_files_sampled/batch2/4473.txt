joining us now member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Democratic congressman Adriano SP out of New York it's good to have you on the show I want to talk about immigration two parallel stories to ask you about first of all you're getting behind a certain family of probably all the families of the children who are separate from their families but a specific Guatemalan family a woman who was separated from her three children what is the update on her situation well we were able to bring her first of all what she was able to post bail Danny Gonzalez yes three children in New York she was able to make bail America has a huge heart and people from all over the country are trying to help reunite these families how did she make bail she has three children she's separated from three children 11 9 and 6 well groups of New Yorkers were able to raise the money for her basically $7,500 and then she was able to come from Arizona and they had a motorcade pretty much like from state to state bring her here to New York and have her meet her children for the first time they were separated so that was a real emotional moment but the citizens of this nation have been very supportive of these mothers and fathers and and this is just one case what we were able to bring her together now we're trying to get them permanently together that will that can take anywhere from 30 to 60 days so we're trying to get them together as quickly as possible her children now were are would a foster family in New York City and she's able to visit them on a regular basis at the conversation so won't even have them completely yeah as you know congressman one of the frustrations many Americans have is that it's taking so long yes since President Trump stopped the separation there still we learned again yesterday from HHS somewhere under 3,000 children in government custody why is it taking so long what's the what are the some of the roadblocks to getting these parents and kids back to well issues is a fingerprinting so in order for you to bring their children back to their family everybody in the household where the children are gonna be has to get fingerprinted the government contracts a private company that processes the fingerprints are they taking far too long that's just one of the obstacles the other obstacle is bail ironically enough a bail is different for different people $7,500 for Jenny who came here this week but $15,000 for other mothers that we're working on so some of these moms are gonna have to pay more bail than even violent criminals pay and some of the criminal courts is absolutely incredible pretty horrific situation for these families not so much of the debate in the aftermath on this in this ongoing crisis issue Shay's about the role of ice you've sponsored legislation to abolish it tell us why that's a good idea to abolish it rather than perhaps calling for some sort of reform or modification to the agency because ice has become a runaway train he has really detour from its original mission the jurisdiction that the agency has is very broad is there to combat terrorism human trafficking drugs and it's paying more attention now on mothers like getting as opposed to paying attention to hardened criminals that really impact negatively the quality of life in our country so the legislation says we will do away with it by the end of the year but in the meantime we will establish a commission that they will put forward or some recommendations as to which agency should replace ice we already have that model by the way we have ATF we have DEA other agencies that are exclusively concentrated in one particular area I should be exclusively concentrating on immigration but we know that basically there's no chance of that legislation passing its way since you're in the minority and the with the Republican majority so what can you do working with your colleagues from across the aisle to help these families now ice is a big issue but and I understand your concerns there but what can they where can you find consensus well we put forth the keep the families together Act which is a piece of legislation that will help keep these families to be Republicans well some of them I think will come our way one of the reasons why you see the administration backpedaling is because the American people many of them are so uncomfortable with what's going on similarly to how they are with dreamers over 85% of support dreamers staying here in the United States and that's why even in red states in red districts many of the men my colleagues of Congress are concerned about the status of dreamers as they are concerned no one is comfortable seeing or hearing a child cry for their parents in the middle of the night that's just not who we are as a nation and so I think the scenario said the problem is that the White House begins to move forward and tries to put and attach toxic provisions to immigration reform that makes it very uncomfortable for anybody to reach an agreement for example 25 billion dollars for wall doing away with 40% of legal immigration undoing family reunification getting rid of TPS and also diversity visas these are the things that are put on the table when we want to fix the reunification is you don't want to fix the dreamers so we want to move forward in a sensible way and I think that there are many Republicans that are willing to move ahead with us some would argue just give him the wall to try and work with him whether you agree with it or not willing artist and you likely will have a new colleague come to fall alexandria el castillo Cortez in your New York delegation I'll ask you the same question we asked her on the set the morning after she won last week what should Democrats learn from her campaign and her message well I think she's obviously running a very good campaign and is someone that has very progressive values I happen to share some of those values I happen to have a similar history except I ran twice before she got it the first time I Chi must have something in her formula I didn't work for me but I you know it's a I like Joe Crowley you know we served together in the New York State Assembly he served with distinction now she's coming in and I'm looking forward to working with her and sharing some of these ideas that she has on immigration and other matters that are really important to the American people so she made a lot of promises in her campaign full employment federal guarantees all the way down the line are those realistic is there a way to pay for those well you know Mario Cuomo says used to say that you know your campaign you campaign in poetry but you govern in prose and so you know this is almost like being on the understands of a baseball game and saying how come that batter can't it is unable to hit that hundred mile an hour fastball well when you get him to plate and you see that fastball coming at you it turns the size of an aspirin so you know being in the arena obviously there are many obstacles but I wouldn't put anything beyond her because she was able to win a historic election and I think she brings some fresh new ideas and I think we should take a look at that mine embrace many um so easier said than done adriano aspire thank you very much still ahead thanks for checking out MSNBC on
