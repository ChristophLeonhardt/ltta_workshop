1
00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:04,061
SHEPARD SMITH.

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:04,961
YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:09,633
STARTS RIGHT NOW.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:10,467
>> President Trump: NO, I DON'T

5
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:11,435
THINK HE'S PLAYING.

6
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:12,636
IT'S NEVER GONE THIS FAR.

7
00:00:12,636 --> 00:00:15,072
I DON'T THINK IT HAS HAD THIS

8
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:16,306
ENTHUSIASM FOR SOMEBODY, FOR

9
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:17,741
THEM WANTING TO MAKE A DEAL.

10
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:19,176
YEAH, I AGREE, THE UNITED STATES

11
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:20,577
HAS BEEN PLAYED BEAUTIFULLY LIKE

12
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:21,945
A FIDDLE.

13
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:22,713
BECAUSE YOU HAD A DIFFERENT KIND

14
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:23,747
OF A LEADER.

15
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:25,682
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE MADE.

16
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:27,984
>> Neil: THE PRESIDENT CONVINCED

17
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:30,487

19
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:34,091
AN LEADERS THERE'S SOMETHING

20
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:34,458
GOING ON.

21
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,026
ITLES TO THE TREND THAT THE

22
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,127
PRESIDENT LIKES AND HOPES TO

23
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:38,595
LEVERAGE OFF OF, WHEN HE MEETS

24
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:40,263

25
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:42,232
AND JUST MAYBE A FEW WEEKS.

26
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:44,768

34
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,114
DEVELOPMENTS.

35
00:00:57,114 --> 00:00:58,048
BLAKE BERMAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE

36
00:00:58,048 --> 00:00:58,749
ON A CERTAIN MEETING MOMENTS

37
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,584
AGO.

38
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:00,884
BLAKE?

PRESIDENT THAT SOUND BITE WHICH

00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:07,924
TODAY, HE SAID THAT PAST

43
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:08,692
ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN PLAYED

44
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,360
LIKE A FIDDLE BY THE NORTH

45
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,161
KOREANS, HE SAID THAT IS NOT

46
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:15,265
GOING TO HAPPEN TO US.

47
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:16,967
A LITTLE WHILE AGO AT A JOINT

48
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,368
NEWS CONFERENCE WITH ANGELA

49
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:20,070
MERKEL I ASKED THE PRESIDENT IF

50
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,773
HE FEELS AS IF HE NEEDS TO BE

51
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,175
THE CLOSER TO GET A DEAL DONE, A

52
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:26,376
PEACE DEAL DONE, ON THE KOREAN

53
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:27,043
PENINSULA.

54
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,446
LISTEN HERE.

55
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:31,047
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S YOUR

56
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:32,549
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TO

57
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,485
EVENTUALLY GET SETTLED BETWEEN

58
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:36,086
NORTH AND SOUTH CROW A.

59
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:36,787
>> President Trump: I THINK I

60
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:37,354
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.

61
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:38,088
OTHER HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE DONE

62
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:39,122
IT.

63
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:40,290
I THINK THE RESPONSIBILITY HAS

64
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,625
FALLEN ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE

65
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,660
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

66
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,429
AND I THINK WE HAVE, I THINK I

67
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:46,196
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE IF

68
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,697
I CAN DO IT.

69
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:51,468
AND IF I CAN'T DO IT IT WILL BE

70
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:53,170
A VERY TOUGH TIME FOR A LOT OF

71
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,337
COUNTRIES.

72
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:57,607
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE.

73
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:59,276
IT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT I

74
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,578
HOPE CAN I DO FOR THE WORLD.

75
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,146
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO BEEN

76
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:04,848
RECENTLY TALKING HOW HE HAS A

77
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:08,651
STRONG WORKING WERATIONSHIP HIS

78
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:09,386
ADMINISTRATION DOES WITH THE

79
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:10,586
NORTH KOREANS.

80
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:13,490
WHEN I ASKED IF HE HAS SPOKEN

81
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,991
WITH KIM JONG-UN OR PLANS TO DO

82
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,426
SO BEFORE THE TWO MEET, HE

83
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:19,129
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GO THERE.

84
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:19,896
>> President Trump: I DON'T WANT

85
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:20,931
TO COMMENT ON THAT.

86
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,332
>> DO YOU PLAN ON SPEAKING TO

87
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:22,966
HIM BEFORE?

88
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,935
>> WE HAVE A GOOD WORKING

89
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,069
RELATIONSHIP.

90
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,737
WE'RE SETTING UP A MEETING.

91
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:30,106
THINGS OF CHANGED VERY RADICALLY

92
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:31,608
FROM A FEW MONTHS AGO.

93
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:32,609
YOU KNOW THE NAME CALLING AND A

94
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:34,678
LOT OF OTHER THINGS.

95
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:37,747
>> FOR THAT MEETING, NEIL, THE

96
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,349
PRESIDENT SAYS IT'S SKILL

97
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:40,750
SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE
