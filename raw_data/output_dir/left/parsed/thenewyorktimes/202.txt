It’s moving day at
the New York Aquarium.
These workers are transporting
sand tiger, sandbar
and nurse sharks
into a new permanent exhibit
called “Ocean Wonders: Sharks!”
“It will be a
mixed species exhibit
in which you’ll have
large-bodied individuals
and then you’ll have large
schools of smaller fish.
We also have 
a sea turtle in there.
All these species
found right here
in New York as part
of our own wildlife fauna.”
The exhibit has been in
the works for over a decade
and was delayed
many years by damage
from Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
But moving these
animals isn’t easy.
“People think it’s either like,
oh, you just grab them up
like you do with
goldfish in a bag
or it’s some sort of
shark rodeo
where you wrestle them in.
And the truth is, it’s
a very well-thought-out,
precision operation.”
First, the shark needs to
be corralled into a sling.
It sometimes takes a few tries.
“Beautiful.”
“You got my back, Jeff?”
“Yup.”
“Rope, rope.”
After the shark is
lifted out of the water,
it’s time for a short
ride to his new home.
Before they join the
rest of the fish,
they get a checkup.
“ and open the drain valve.”
“Hold on.”
“Hold on.”
“We don’t get our hands
on these sharks very often,
so we want to get things like
weight, we want to get length,
we want to get girth.
We take blood draws
because we’re doing any number
of assessments of the health.”
“All right, drop him down.”
“Down.”
Finally, the ordeal is over.
“Come on, big guy.”
It’s time to settle in.
