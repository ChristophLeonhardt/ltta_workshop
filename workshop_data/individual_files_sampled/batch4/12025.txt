California is now considering creating a fake news advisory group in order to monitor information posted and spread on social media not a joke is according to CBS local Sacramento Senate bill 1424 would require the California Attorney General to create an advisory committee by April 1 2019 it would need to consist of at least one person from the DOJ representative from social media providers civil liberties advocates and First Amendment scholars the advisory group would be required by the California State Government to study how false information is spread online and to come up with a plan for social media platforms to fix the problem the left is fully convinced that the reason they've been losing elections is because of fake news it can't just be the people think their arguments are garbage it has to be fake news it has to be the people are being deceived and thus we need to regulate speech and just the way that this New York Times op-ed writing Yale professor was saying that we need to regulate speech state of California wants to regulate speech to state of California has already moved in this direction with their educational policy they're attempting to move in this direction with their non-discrimination policies suggesting that if people like me say in the state of California that man is a man and a woman as a woman that we ought to be fined now they're cracking down even harder they want to have the government determine what it's fake news or not it's hard to think of anything more Orwellian than the government determining what sort of news ought to be covered that is deeply Orwellian stuff if Donald Trump were doing it the left would be crying Nazi right now but it's the state of California doing it so we have to pretend this is all about tolerance and diversity how radical is this bill the Electronic Frontier Foundation which is a left-wing group opposed the bill calling it flawed and misguided the group argued the measure would make the government an advisory group responsible for deciding what is true and what is false and it points out the First Amendment prevents content-based restrictions even if statements are admittedly false so it's just another indicator that when when it comes to gaining political power the left has no compunction about using governmental censorship in order to achieve their ends that's why as much as I like I dislike the incivility that is evidence in our politics right now I'm not gonna pretend that left and right are exactly the same across the spectrum in the way that George will and David Brooks seem to want to right now
