100
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:17,190
BEING VERY DISMISSIVE.

101
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,325
I THOUGHT THEY WORKED FOR

102
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:18,892
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

103
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:19,993
WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME

104
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:22,029

110
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:28,301
HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING.

111
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:28,969
WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING US

112
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,237
ABOUT THAT AND NOT

113
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,172
QUESTIONING US ABOUT HOW WE

114
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:33,040
WERE CENSORED.

115
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,876
THEY WERE TOTALLY

116
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:36,276
DISMISSIVE.

117
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,811
I FELT OFFENDED AS AN

118
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,312
AMERICAN, BORN ON THIS SOIL,

119
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:42,115
THAT FIRST BLACK PEOPLE --

120
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:44,151
THAT DON'T WANT US TO OBTAIN

121
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:45,352
THE AMERICAN DREAM AND,

122
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:46,787
SECOND, THEY DISMISSED OUR

123
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,155
CLAIM, YES, A DACA PERSON

124
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,390
CAN GO UP THERE THAT'S NOT

125
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,458
EVEN BORN ON THIS SOIL AND

126
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,693
THEY LISTEN ALL DAY.

127
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:53,760
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

128
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,228
BUT, LISTEN, WE'RE NOT GOING

129
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:56,296
TO BE SILENCED.

130
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:57,064
>> NO, WE'RE NOT.

131
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:58,198
>> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP

132
00:02:58,198 --> 00:02:59,433
TALKING OUT AND SPEAKING OUT

133
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:02,169
AGAINST PEOPLE THAT TRY

134
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:02,936
CENSOR PEOPLE'S FREE SPEECH.

135
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:04,805
>> WE ARE VERY THANKFUL TO

136
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:06,073
THE WHITE REPUBLICAN THAT

137
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:07,140
ALLOWED US A SEAT AT THE

138
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,508
TABLE TO SPEAK OUR TRUTH

139
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:11,044
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON UNLIKE

140
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:11,978
THE BLACK MEN.

141
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:13,280
AND THE REASON WHY I SAY

142
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,748
THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN

143
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:16,650
ON THE DEMOCRAT PLANTATION.

144
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,018
WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE OVER

145
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:20,053
THERE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT

146
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:20,787
CONDITION BLACK PEOPLE'S

147
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:22,155
MINDS TO MAKE US THINK THAT

148
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:22,989
WHITE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT

149
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,524
US TO WORK, DON'T WANT US TO

150
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:25,826
HAVE ANY MONEY IN OUR

151
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:26,993
POCKET, BUT IT WAS A BLACK

152
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:28,128
MAN THAT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT

153
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,229
HOW MUCH MONEY DIAMOND AND

154
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,598
SILK WAS MAKING AND WAS

155
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,599
APPALLED ABOUT US MAKING

156
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,567
MONEY LEGALLY.

157
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,669
>> AND IT AIN'T NOTHING

158
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,571
WRONG WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS

159
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:38,672
OBTAINING THE AMERICAN

160
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:38,972
DREAM.

161
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:40,140
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE VOTED

162
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,807
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

163
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:41,708
IT'S TIME FOR BLACK

164
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,411
AMERICANS TO COME UM AND

165
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,146

166
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,314
LISTENING TO THESE BLACK

REPRESENTATIVES.

168
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:48,915
>> WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT

169
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:49,716
WHITE RACISM.

170
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:52,052
IT'S BLACK ON BLACK RACISM.

171
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:53,820
BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO CHECK

172
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,621
THEIRSELF FIRST.

173
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:55,922
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

174
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:56,590
BRIAN: WHAT CONGRESSMAN ARE
