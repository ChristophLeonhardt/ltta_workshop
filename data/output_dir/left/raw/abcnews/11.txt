WE WILL ALSO WORK TO REDUCE 

92
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,370
BARRIERS AND INCREASE TRADE IN 

93
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,606

94
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,240
PHARMACEUTICALS, MEDICAL 

95
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,575
PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS SOYBEANS.

96
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:33,179
SOYBEANS IS A BIG DEAL.

97
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,113
AND THE EUROPEAN UNION IS GOING 

98
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,249
TO START ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO 

99
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,686
BUY A LOT OF SOYBEANS.

100
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,620
THEY ARE A TREMENDOUS MARKET.

101
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,459
BUY A LOT OF SOYBEANS FROM OUR 

102
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,226
FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST PR

103
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:47,493
PRIMARILY.

104
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,529
SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT, 

105
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,396
JEAN-CLAUDE.

106
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,497
THIS WILL OPEN MARKETS FOR 

107
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,166
FARMERS AND WORKERS, INCREASE 

108
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,700
INVESTMENT, AND LEAD TO GREATER 

109
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,303
PROSPERITY IN BOTH THE UNITED 

110
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,238
STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION.

111
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,075
IT WILL ALSO MAKE TRADE FAIRER 

112
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,609
AND MORE RECIPROCAL.

113
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,412
MY FAVORITE WORD, RECIPROCAL.

114
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,049
SECONDLY, WE AGREED TO A 

115
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,951
STRENGTHENED AND STRENGTHENING 

116
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,318
OF OUR STRATEGIC COOPERATION 

117
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:16,022
WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY.

118
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,957
THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO 

119
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,692
IMPORT MORE LIQUEFIED NATURAL 

120
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,995
GAS, LNG, FROM THE UNITED 

121
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,230
STATES, AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE

122
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,598
A VERY, VERY BIG BUYER.

123
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,433
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH 

124
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,535
EASIER FOR THEM, BUT THEY ARE 

125
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:33,172
GOING TO BE A MASSIVE BUYER OF 

126
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,006
LNG.

127
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:35,241
SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO 

128
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,241
DIVERSIFY THEIR ENERGY SUPPLY, 

129
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,977
WHICH THEY WANT VERY MUCH TO DO,

130
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,179
AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF IT.

131
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,248
THIRDLY, WE AGREED TODAY TO 

132
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,184
LAUNCH A CLOSE DIALOGUE ON 

133
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,187
STANDARDS IN ORDER TO EASE 

134
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,190
TRADE, REDUCE BUREAUCRATIC 

135
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,228
OBSTACLES, AND SLASH COSTS 

136
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:55,762
DRAMATICALLY.

137
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,330
FOURTHLY, WE AGREED TO JOINT 

138
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,232
FORCES TO PROTECT AMERICAN AND 

139
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:02,768
EUROPEAN COMPANIES FROM BETTER 

140
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,070
AND REALLY BETTER THAN EVER -- 

141
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,940
WE'VE NEVER DONE LIKE WE'RE 

142
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,008
DOING, I CAN SAY FROM THE 

143
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,209
STANDPOINT OF THE UNITED STATES.

144
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,243
WE HAVE NEVER DONE THIS WELL, 

145
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,045
BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO A LOT 

146
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,248
BETTER AFTER WE DO THIS DEAL AND

147
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,148
OTHER DEALS THAT WE ARE 

148
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:22,255
CURRENTLY WORKING ON.

149
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:22,889
LIKEWISE, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS 

150
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,424
GOING TO DO BETTER, STRONGER, 

151
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:24,657
BIGGER.

152
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,226
WE WILL, THEREFORE, WORK CLOSELY

153
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,328
TOGETHER WITH LIKE-MINDED 

154
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,931
PARTNERS TO REFORM THE WTO AND 

155
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,901
TO ADDRESS UNFAIR TRADING 

156
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,235
PRACTICES, INCLUDING 

157
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,038
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT, 

158
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,474
FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, 

159
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,374
INDUSTRIAL SUBSIDIES, 

160
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:45,244
DISTORTIONS CREATED BY 

161
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,948
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, AND 

162
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:49,281
OVERCAPACITY.

163
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,550
WE DECIDED TO SET UP IMMEDIATELY

164
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,221
AN EXECUTIVE WORKING GROUP, OF 

165
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,256
VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ON BOTH 

166
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:57,657
SIDES.

167
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,358
THEY WILL BE OUR CLOSEST 

168
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,392
ADVISORS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO 

169
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:04,664
CARRY OUT THIS JOINT AGENDA.

170
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,399
IN ADDITION, IT WILL IDENTIFY 

171
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,835
SHORT-TERM MEASURES TO 

172
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,135
FACILITATE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGES 

173
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,272
AND ASSESS EXISTING TARIFF 

174
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,474
MEASURES AND WHAT WE CAN DO 

175
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,276
ABOUT THAT TO THE BETTERMENT OF 

176
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:17,509
BOTH.

177
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,278
WHILE WE ARE WORKING ON THIS, WE

178
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,715
WILL NOT GO AGAINST THE SPIRIT 

179
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,518
OF THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS EITHER 

180
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,752
PARTY TERMINATES THE 

181
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:27,052
NEGOTIATION.

182
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:28,554
SO WE'RE STARTING THE 

183
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,089
NEGOTIATION RIGHT NOW, BUT WE 

184
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,094
KNOW VERY MUCH WHERE IT'S GOING.

185
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,563
WE ALSO WILL VRESOLVE THE STEEL 

186
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,899
AND ALUMINUM TARIFF ISSUES, AND 

187
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
WE WILL RESOLVE RETALIATORY 

188
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,168
TARIFFS.

189
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,904
WE HAVE SOME TARIFFS THAT ARE 

190
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,172
RETALIATORY, AND THAT WILL GET 

191
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,173
RESOLVED AS PART OF WHAT WE'RE 

192
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:48,808
DOING.

193
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,677
AND WITH THAT, JEAN-CLAUDE, 

194
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:51,910
PLEASE. 

195
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,979
>> MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND 

196
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,582
GENTLEMEN, WHEN I WAS INVITED BY

197
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,484
THE PRESIDENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE

198
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,186
I HAD ONE INTENTION.

199
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,489
I HAD THE INTENSE TO MAKE A DEAL

200
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,260
TODAY, AND WE MADE A DEAL TODAY.

201
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,996
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF 

202
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:15,234
AREAS IN WHICH TO WORK TOGETHER.

203
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,303
WORK TOWARDS ZERO TARIFFS ON 

204
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,205
INDUSTRIAL GOODS.

205
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:19,772
THAT WAS MY MAIN INTENTION.

206
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,042
TO PROPOSE TO COME DOWN TO ZERO 

207
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,012
TARIFFS ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS.

208
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,881
WE'VE DECIDED TO STRENGTHEN OUR 

209
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,583
COOPERATION ON ENERGY.

210
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,686
YOU WILL BUILD MORE TERMINALS TO

211
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,720
IMPORT LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS 

212
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,254
FROM THE U.S.

213
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:39,224
THIS IS ALSO A MESSAGE FOR 

214
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:39,692
OTHERS.

215
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,829
WE AGREE TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE

216
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,564
ON STANDARDS.

217
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,367
AS FAR AS AGRICULTURE IS 

218
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,301
CONCERNED, THE EUROPEAN UNION 

219
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,736
CAN IMPORT MORE SOYBEANS FROM 

220
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,471
THE U.S., AND IT WILL BE DONE.

221
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,506
AND WE ALSO AGREE TO WORK 

222
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,376
TOGETHER ON THE REFORM OF THE 

223
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,245
WTO.

224
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,881
THIS, OF COURSE, IS ON THE 

225
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,950
UNDERSTANDING THAT AS LONG AS WE

226
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,217
ARE NEGOTIATING, UNLESS ONE 

227
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:09,722
PARTY WOULD STOP THE 

228
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,524
NEGOTIATIONS, WE HOLD OFF 

229
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,292
FURTHER TARIFFS AND REASSESS 

230
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,493
EXISTING TARIFFS ON STEEL AND 

231
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,261
ALUMINUM.

232
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,997
THIS WAS A GOOD CONSTRUCTIVE 

233
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,297
MEETING.

234
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,599
THANK YOU, DONALD. 

235
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,470
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 

236
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,770
JEAN-CLAUDE.

237
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,239
[ APPLAUSE ]

238
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,041
>> AND I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE 

239
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,178
BY SAYING THIS WAS A VERY BIG 

240
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,347
DAY FOR FREE AND FAIR TRADE.

241
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,715
VERY BIG DAY, INDEED.

242
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:36,881
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.

243
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:37,149
THANK YOU.

244
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,988
THANK YOU.

245
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:46,092
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT.

246
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:46,592
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 

247
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,726
PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN 

248
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,129
COMMISSION, JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER,

249
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,897
ANNOUNCING THEY REACHED SOME 

250
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,432
AGREEMENT TOG FORWARD ON TRADE.

251
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,101
TERRY, LISTENING TO BOTH LEADERS

252
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,469
RIGHT THERE, WHAT IS SOUNDS LIKE

253
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,071
IS ACTUALLY A DE-ESCALATION 

254
00:08:59,071 --> 00:08:59,338
AGREEMENT.

255
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,307
NOT A LOT OF CONCRETE MEASURES 

256
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,575
ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT, 

257
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,709
ALTHOUGH THE EUROPEANS SAID THEY

258
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,378
WILL BE BUYING MORE SOYBEANS.

259
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,012
BUT THEY ARE BASICALLY GOING TO 

260
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,982
HOLD OFF ON NEW TARIFFS AND 

261
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:10,782
ESCALATION IN THE TRADE WAR AS 

262
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:11,884
THEY TALK ABOUT FIGURING OUT 

263
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,353
SOME WAY TO GET TO ZERO TARIFFS 

264
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,755
AND A NEW TRADING RELATIONSHIP. 

265
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,057
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

266
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,960
THIS IS, AS YOU SAY, IT'S AN 

267
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,360
ASPIRATIONAL DEAL.

268
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,895
THEY AGREED TO BEGIN 

269
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,064
NEGOTIATIONS AND WORK TOGETHER 

270
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,466
TOWARDS A REGIME OF NO TARIFFS 

271
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,734
ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS BETWEEN THE 

272
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,402
UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.

273
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,270
THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERED THIS, 

274
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,737
REMEMBER.

275
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,207
WHAT MADE PRESIDENT TRUMP ANGRY 

276
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,643
WAS THAT THIS STEEL AND ALUMINUM

277
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,079
PROTECTIONIST MEASURES IN EUROPE

278
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,448
HE BELIEVED WERE HURTING THE 

279
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,482
INDUSTRIAL CORE OF THE UNITED 

280
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,383
STATES WHICH SUPPORTED HIM AND 

281
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,584
WHICH HE WANTED TO DELIVER 

282
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,252
SOMETHING TO, AND THAT AT LEAST 

283
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,155
IS WHAT HAS BEGUN HERE.

284
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,690
I TELL YOU, THERE IS NO QUESTION

285
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,058
THAT WALL STREET IS RELIEVED 

286
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,460
BECAUSE THE PROSPECT OF YET 

287
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,161
ANOTHER TRADE WAR, REMEMBER 

288
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,329
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ONE ONGOING 

289
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:59,231
RIGHT NOW WITH CHINA, ONE WITH 

290
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,299
CANADA AND MEXICO SEEMS TO BE IN

291
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,501
THE OFFING, AND THERE WAS ONE 

292
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,271
CERTAINLY COOKING BETWEEN THE 

293
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:05,905
UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.

294
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:10,042
THE RELIEF OF THAT PRESSURE SENT

295
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,777
THE STOCK MARKET SKYROCKETING 

296
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:11,977
TODAY.

297
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:14,880
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T 

298
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,413
SEEN WERE PRESIDENT TRUMP.

299
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:16,315
HE IS WILLING TO BACK DOWN A 

300
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,517
LITTLE BIT ON HIS PUNITIVE 

301
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,952
PROTECTIONIST AGENDA AND AGREE 

302
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,386
TO TALK. 

303
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,788
>> IT WENT UP 150 POINTS AFTER 

304
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:27,793
WORD OF A POTENTIAL AGREEMENT 

305
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,027
LEAKED.

306
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,530
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A COUPLE WEEKS

307
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,998
MAKES, TARA.

308
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:35,067
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN EUROPE A 

309
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,335
COUPLE WEEKS AGO CALLING EUROPE 

310
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,036
A FOE. 

311
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,037
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

312
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,473
AND JAUND CLAUD JUNCKER CAME TO 

313
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,243
TOWN READY TO MAKE A DEAL.

314
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,077
U.S. OFFICIALS SEEMED RELUCTANT 

315
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,778
THAT HIS PLAN WHICH WAS TO OFFER

316
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:50,182
A SMALL TRADE DEAL ON INDUSTRIAL

317
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:50,582
PR

318
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,984
PRODUCTS OR GET RID OF TARIFFS 

319
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:53,552
ON CARS WOULD ACTUALLY BE 

320
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,486
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT 

321
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:58,557
WOULD TAKE TO AND BE INTERESTED 

322
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:58,723
IN.

323
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,859
HE HAS BEEN ANIMATED SAYING HE 

324
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,661
DOESN'T WANT TARIFFS OR 

325
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:02,928
SUBSIDIES.

326
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,998
HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE SOME SORT OF

327
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,698
DEAL TO DE-ESCALATE AND -- WHAT 

328
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,734
THEY REALLY WANTED WAS FOR HIM 

329
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,202
TO COME HOME SAYING THERE WILL 

330
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,236
BE NO TARIFFS OBJECT CARS.

331
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,272
THE GERMAN CAR MAKERS WERE 

332
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,273
REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THAT AND 

333
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,841
THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

334
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,508
PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T FOLLOW 

335
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,810
THROUGH AND PLACE A 25% TARIFF 

336
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,245
ON THAT.

337
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,680
BUT, YEAH, IT'S A REAL CHANGE 

338
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,415
FROM LAST WEEK, AND WE'LL SEE 

339
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,284
WHERE THIS ACTUALLY LEADS TO.

340
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,087
AS WE KNOW, THE U.S. AND THE 

341
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:28,754
EUROPEAN UNION BEFORE PRESIDENT 

342
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,390
TRUMP TOOK OFFICE WAS WORKING ON

343
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,759
A REALLY BROAD TRANS-ATLANTIC 

344
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,628
TRADE AGREEMENT, AND THAT FELL 

345
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:37,196
APART.

346
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:41,033
THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

347
00:11:41,033 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP PULLED OUT OF
