the media world was sent into a state of shock this past week when the news broke of Ed Schultz passing there's an empty room at Artie America and a gaping hole in the world of responsible journalism with the loss of one of my my very closest friends Edie Schultz with his loss there comes a loss of courage in reporting the loss of a willingness to call balls and strikes it's a loss that could not have come at a worse time a time when reporters and anchors and producers and contributors at places like MSNBC and CNN and Fox and ABC are so terrified of losing their jobs that they're willing to bastardize the truth massaged the facts and land where their corporate masters tell him to land not because they land on the truth but because the money is good ed Schultz was willing to give up the most lucrative job he ever had in his career a job as most talented news reporter that MSNBC ever had ever had sitting in an anchor chair a job that he quit because corporate numbered crunchers had had political agendas that prevented him from reporting the news rather than delivering corporate and political pablum that was fashion not buy a news department but was fashioned by NBA's and CEOs and CEOs who cared more about being delivery boys for the DNC political agendas and advertisers and even the establishment government they cared more about all of that than they did actually delivering news programs that had a place for real reporters real reporters like Ed Schultz everyone here at RT America will suffer the loss of Ed Schultz for a very long time in the business of journalism and responsible reporting was suffer right along with us whether the industry has the honesty and the good sense to understand that or not ed Schultz we're gonna miss you you know III think one of the greatest stories I've heard of ed Schultz and we heard it at the time he actually came from John Nichols you know he and John Nichols were also very close he went to Wisconsin constantly during the Scott Walker recall election and John Nichols told the story after news passed of Ed about how Edie would go there talk to the people in the streets but not just for the camera Edie would talk to these people throughout the night no cameras no reporters no nothing this wasn't for optics Edie wanted to talk to the people whose lives were being affected and get their stories not to go out there and tell the story and get ratings but because he actually cared he wanted to know what was happening he wanted to know how it affected the guy down the street and the guy on the other street it was such a moving story that really captured what Edie was this it was never about ratings it was never about trying to get the viewers in there it was about what's your story what's going on what's happening in the world how does this affect the average people and you you don't see that you do not see that anywhere else there's nobody that has replaced that and there won't be I don't think there ever will be well you know truthfully we've seen this you and I have seen it firsthand you were a dear friend of Ed's too and he hear the words that he had for you were well remarkable Farren he called you the young that one of the most talented young reporters coming up in the business coming from ed Schultz that was a huge huge compliment but what we saw happen with Edie MSNBC there it's impossible to talk about ed the edge Schultz story with a without understanding what has happened with media in general Edie used to be very critical I remember we when the BP oil spill took place okay we were involved in it I I knew I really hadn't been up close personal friends with Edie really before that but ed invited me on MSNBC to talk about it and he allowed me to say the things that the corporate media ordinarily would not let you say is it's in other words it wasn't I wasn't on there to apologize for BP b.p are a bunch of thugs they destroyed an entire ecosystem they killed 17 people and I was able to go on and tell that story in a way that allowed me to really tell the story I compared that to two appearances that I made in other in other media where's all well now you're gonna have to tone that down we can't really say that well they couldn't say it because beef he was advertising VP was spending tons of money and in it in effect after after those first few shows and I actually was able to go after VP and tell the story you know management management at MSNBC well maybe we maybe were being a little harsh and those statements came right along with maybe BP is paying us a lot of advertising dollars right now so there was no place except for a place except for Ed Schultz to where you could tell those stories as a matter of fact he came back and followed up on BB and tell that story it's a remarkable story came back and did a great series down here on the coast about how the the catastrophe had affected lives yeah about five years I guess it was after the spill ed was the only national reporter that came back down here you know Oh everybody covered it while it was happening but once they plugged the well and the oil starts washing up on the shore everybody at left Edie was still covering it but then five years later did what nobody else did came down here talked to you talk to business owners fishermen yeah who'd had their their businesses destroyed from this their lives forever changed and he he got their stories he helped tell their stories and helped remind the public that hey this catastrophe that happened on the BP it wasn't a five-month catastrophe it's not even a five-year catastrophe this is a generation of destruction that BP calls but the media had already moved on to shiny things other shiny things and you know to me the best analysis of the BP story when I when I compared it to other things that you know finally I got to tell you firsthand this idea where ed was fired now Edie could have stayed on all he had to do was play you know Phil Griffin's game he had to play what's the lack guy that owns NBC I mean that runs NBC yeah you know lack and Phil Griffin we're telling him you have to do this you can't tell Matt he was there prepared very interesting story here he was one of the very few reporters that you know there are a lot a lot of coverage but a reporter that was there to really cover and so we could understand what Bernie Sanders was all about okay he's at their house he's in front of him he's talking they're in the backyard ready to film kids are running around everything's taking place it's a it's a wonderful scene that he's set up to let us know who Bernie Sanders is Phil Griffin calls and says well you can't do that you got a coat you got to go cover a story in Texas because it's raining in Texas some nonsense like that well all it was was the DNC owns MSNBC and the DNC was counting on the fact that Phil Griffin and that lack character would do whatever they demanded and so they shut down
