COMING, DON'T YOU THINK? 
  HELLO 
MINNESOTA. 
GREAT STATE, THANK YOU. 
I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN THE 
HEARTLAND WITH THOUSANDS OF 
HARD-WORKING AND TRULY GREAT 
AMERICAN PATRIOTS. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS OF 
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, AMERICA 
HAS ACHIEVED THE BIGGEST 
COMEBACK IN OUR HISTORY. 
TRUE. 
JOBS ARE BOOMING. 
WAGES ARE RISING. 
AND THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS 
WORKING RIGHT NOW, TODAY, HAS 
REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH IN OUR 
HISTORY. 
WE ARE DEFENDING OUR GREAT 
SECOND AMENDMENT. 
TAKING CARE OF OUR WONDERFUL 
VETERANS, WHO WE LOVE AND 
RESPECT. 
AND OUR MILITARY WILL SOON BE 
MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE, 
BY FAR. 
BUT THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS WANT 
TO TAKE IT ALL AWAY. 
THEY WANT TO DESTROY OUR 
PROSPERITY. 
WE HAVE HAD GREAT PROSPERITY. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR 401(K) 
BEING CUT IN HALF. 
IF YOU VOTE DEMOCRAT, THAT IS 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 
THEY WANT TO ERASE OUR GAINS 
AND PLUNGE OUR COUNTRY INTO A 
NIGHTMARE OF GRIDLOCK, POVERTY, 
CHAOS AND, FRANKLY, CRIME. 
THAT IS WHAT COMES WITH IT. 
SO, WE ARE JUST FIVE WEEKS AWAY 
FROM ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS IN OUR 
LIFETIME. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN 
WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW. 
SO YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT 
IS. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. 
  
  
>> BY THE WAY, LOOK BACK THERE. 
LOOK AT ALL THAT MEDIA. 
IF WE COULD EVER GET THEM ON 
OUR SIDE, WE WOULD WIN FOR 1000 
YEARS. 
1000 YEARS. 
ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 6, I NEED 
YOUR VOTE. 
I NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO STOP 
RADICAL DEMOCRATS AND TO ELECT 
PROUD MINNESOTA REPUBLICANS. 
AND WE HAVE SOME GREAT ONES 
RIGHT NOW UP FOR ELECTION. 
THIS WEEK I ANNOUNCED ANOTHER 
HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR 
NATION. 
WE ARE REPLACING THE JOB 
KILLING DISASTER KNOWN AS 
NAFTA, WITH THE BRAND-NEW U.S.-
MEXICO-CANADA TRADE AGREEMENT. 
IT IS CALLED THE U.S. McA. 
I DID NOT WANT TO USE NAFTA, 
THAT HAS BEEN A DISASTER FOR 
OUR COUNTRY. 
THE 50,000 PLANTS AND FACTORIES 
MOVING OUT. 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS 
LOST. 
ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS 
EVER. 
THERE IS ONE THAT IS WORSE, BUT 
I WON'T TELL YOU, BECAUSE WE 
WILL BE DOING SOMETHING WITH IT
, TOO. 
BUT NAFTA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE 
GREATEST DISASTERS OF ALL TIME 
AND NOW WE HAVE A GREAT AND A 
FAIR DEAL. 
WE HAVE A FAIR DEAL AND THAT IS 
WHAT WE WANT. 
GREAT FOR OUR WORKERS. 
REALLY GREAT FOR OUR FARMERS. 
IT IS ABOUT TIME. 
WE ARE OPENING IT UP. 
THE BARRIERS ARE COMING DOWN. 
THIS IS TREMENDOUS FOR 
MINNESOTA. 
THI IS TREMENDOUS FOR 
MINNESOTA. 
YOU HAVE WAITED FOR A LONG TIME.
BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHAT IS 
GOING ON WITH CHINA? 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. 
BUT I SAY, THEY ARE NOT READY 
YET. 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL, BUT I 
TOLD THEM, YOU WANT TO MAKE A 
DEAL, BUT YOU ARE NOT READY 
YET. 
SO WE WILL TALK LATER. 
WE HAVE SECURED LANDMARK 
PROTECTIONS FOR THE MEDICAL 
INNOVATIONS BEING PRODUCED 
RIGHT HERE IN YOUR GREAT STATE. 
YOU HAVE GREAT MEDICAL IN YOUR 
STATE. 
WE HAVE REMOVED UNFAIR TRADE 
BARRIERS FOR OUR PROUD 
MINNESOTA FARMERS AND OUR DAIRY 
PRODUCERS. 
LIKE IT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE 
BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY. 
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN AND 
AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED 
AGAIN, ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE GOING TO 
KEEP IT THAT WAY FOREVER. 
IT IS CALLED AMERICA FIRST. 
  
  
>> YOU EVEN HAVE PEOPLE SITTING 
BEHIND THE FLAG. 
IT IS OKAY. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE AND YOU HAVE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO I JUST 
SAW IN A LOVELY ROOM. 
I SAID NEXT TIME, YOU HAVE TO 
GET HERE A COUPLE DAYS EARLIER. 
RIGHT? 
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE DEMOCRAT
IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF WINNING. 
BECAUSE YOU ARE WINNING. 
YOU ARE WINNING A LOT. 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN 
ADMINISTRATION THAT IN LESS 
THAN TWO YEARS, CAN YOU BELIEVE,
WE ARE COMING UP ON TWO YEARS. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN 
ADMINISTRATION WITH YOU THAT 
HAS DONE SO MUCH IN SO LITTLE 
TIME. 
NO ADMINISTRATION HAS COME 
CLOSE. 
NONE HAS COME CLOSE. 
AND WE HAVE A LOT COMING. 
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE OVER 
CONGRESS, THE STOCK MARKET WILL 
PLUMMET. 
IT WILL PLUMMET. 
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A REASON FOR 
IT. 
EVERY DAY WE HIT NEW HIGHS. 
I THINK WE HAD 103 NEW HIGHS. 
THAT MEANS JOBS. 
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IT MEANS 
GREAT 401(K)S, BUT TO A LOT OF 
PEOPLE IT MEANS JOBS. 
YOUR 401(K) WILL BE DEVASTATED 
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL AND 
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM WILL GRIND 
TO A REALLY MESSY HALT. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN 
CONGRESS RIGHT NOW WITH ONE OF 
THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE 
POTENTIALLY, HOPEFULLY, SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
MAN. 
  
  
>> WHAT THEY ARE PUTTING HIM 
THROUGH. 
AND HIS FAMILY. 
HIS FAMILY IS INCREDIBLE. 
WHAT THEY ARE PUTTING HIM 
THROUGH. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES. 
THEY WANT TO RESTORE DRUG -- 
RESTORE JOB KILLING REGULATIONS.
WE WANT CLEAN WATER. 
WE WANT CRYSTAL-CLEAR ERROR. 
WE WANT BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT, 
WE WANT IT. 
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE 
REGULATION THAT MAKES IT 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COUNTRY TO 
COMPETE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES 
AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO CRIPPLE 
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF I.C.E. 
HOW ABOUT I.C.E.? 
THEY ARE TOUGH AND THEY LOVE 
OUR COUNTRY. 
THEY ARE TOUGH. 
THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
THEY GET RID OF MS-13, THEY GET 
RID OF THESE GANGS, YOU 
WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. 
THEY THROW THEM OUT OR THEY 
BRING THEM TO JAIL. 
THE DEMOCRATS EMBRACE SOCIALISM.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE 
VENEZUELA. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
AND OPEN OUR BORDERS TO DEADLY 
DRUGS AND VIOLENT GANGS. 
AND I HAVE SET IT AND I WILL 
SAY IT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU 
WANT TO HEAR IT. 
IT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR POLICY. 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRULY THE 
PARTY OF CRIME, BECAUSE THAT IS 
WHAT HAPPENS. 
OPEN BORDERS, THAT'S WHAT 
HAPPENS. 
AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING 
TO DO ANYTHING, TO HURT ANYONE, 
TO GET THE POWER THEY SO 
DESPERATELY CRAVE. 
ALL THEY KNOW IS HOW TO DO, YOU 
KNOW WHAT THE WORDS ARE. 
THEY WANT TO RESIST. 
THEY WANT TO OBSTRUCT. 
THEY WANT TO DELAY, DEMOLISH, 
DESTROY. 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS. 
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON.
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
DESTROY JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
SINCE THE VERY FIRST SECOND HE 
WAS ANNOUNCED. 
HE WAS ANNOUNCED FOR ONE SIMPLE 
REASON. 
HE IS AN INCREDIBLE INTELLECT. 
AN INCREDIBLE PERSON. 
AN INCREDIBLE TALENT. 
HE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE JUDGE.
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WILL PROTECT, UPHOLD 
AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF 
THE UNITED STATES, AS WRITTEN. 
BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK 
AT THE POLLS OVER THE LAST 
THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND IT SHOWS 
THAT THEIR RAGE FILLED 
RESISTANCE IS STARTING TO 
BACKFIRE AT A LEVEL THAT NOBODY 
HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. 
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN IT. 
UP 11, 14, NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN 
THIS BEFORE. 
WE LOVE IT. 
DO WE LOVE IT? 
WE LOVE IT. 
BECAUSE PEOPLE SEE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING AND THEY DO NOT LIKE 
IT. 
THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA AND THE 
PEOPLE OF AMERICA ARE GOING TO 
REJECT THE DEMOCRAT POLITICS OF 
ANGER AND DESTRUCTION AND THEY 
ARE GOING TO VOTE TO KEEP 
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. 
  
>> AND IN TWO YEARS, THEY ARE 
GOING TO VOTE TO KEEP AMERICA 
GREAT. 
RIGHT? 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
WE ARE ALMOST AT THAT POINT 
ALREADY. 
I LOVE MAKE AMERICA GREAT, BUT 
I CAN'T USE IT IN TWO YEARS. 
THEY WILL SAY, WHAT HAVE YOU 
BEEN DOING? 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? 
I TELL YOU, WE HAVE HAD FUN, 
RIGHT? 
THIS, THEY DON'T EVEN CORRECT 
ME WHEN I SAY IT, THE FAKE NEWS 
MEDIA. 
BUT THIS, LOOK, AS AN EXAMPLE. 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN A ROOM 
NEXT DOOR. 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN.
IN ALL FAIRNESS TO MINNESOTA, 
IN LAS VEGAS, IN MISSOURI. 
THANK YOU. 
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BUT YOU ARE 
NOT MY TYPE. 
NO, BUT MISSOURI, 44,000 PEOPLE 
OUTSIDE OF A BIG ARENA. 
44,000 PEOPLE. 
LAS VEGAS, WEST VIRGINIA WAS 
INCREDIBLE. 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
TENNESSEE. 
TENNESSEE. 
YOU SEE HOW FAR TENNESSEE WENT 
UP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
MISSOURI, WOW, WE HAVE DONE 
GREAT. 
JOSH. 
JOSH. 
SO WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED 
BY A NUMBER OF YOUR TERRIFIC 
REPUBLICAN LEADERS. 
I JUST WANT TO INTRODUCE 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN SUCH AN 
INCREDIBLE HELP TO ME. 
IN GETTING YOUR TAX CUTS. 
NOT SO BAD. 
HOW ABOUT THIS? 
HOW ABOUT THIS? 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE 
YOUR TAXES. 
WE WANT TO LOWER YOUR TAXES. 
WE DON'T WANT CRIME. 
CRIME IS OKAY FOR THEM. 
THEY WANT OPEN BORDERS. 
HOW DO WE NOT WIN THIS THING IN 
A LANDSLIDE EVERY TIME? 
THEY ARE FOR CRIME AND HIGH 
TAXES. 
WE ARE FOR LOW TAXES AND NO 
CRIME. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK I WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD POLITICIAN
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS 
EQUATION. 
BUT A MAN WHO HAS BEEN HELPING 
ME A LOT, HE IS A TREMENDOUS 
FORCE IN WASHINGTON, RESPECTED 
BY EVERYONE. 
CONGRESSMAN TOM -- MINNESOTA 
HOUSE SPEAKER KURT DAUDT. 
THANKS, KURT. 
YOUR STATES NEXT ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, DOUG WARDLOW. 
YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR, I HEAR HE 
IS DOING VERY WELL, JEFF 
JOHNSON. 
  
>> WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY THE 
NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM 
MINNESOTA. 
 SEVEN.  
-- KARIN HOUSLEY.  
SHE IS RUNNING AGAINST A FAR 
LEFT DEMOCRAT, WHO NOBODY KNOWS 
WHO SHE IS. 
WHO IS SHE? 
SHE WAS APPOINTED. 
SHE TOOK A WACKY GUYS PLACE. 
HE WAS WACKY. 
BOY, HE FOLDED UP LIKE A WET 
RAG. 
BOY. 
MAN. 
HE WAS GONE SO FAST. 
HE WAS GONE SO FAST. I DON'T 
WANT TO MENTION AL FRANKEN'S 
NAME, SO I WON'T. 
HE WAS GONE SO FAST. 
IT WAS LIKE, OH, HE DID 
SOMETHING. 
I RESIGN. 
I QUIT, I QUIT. 
HE WAS GONE AND REPLACED BY 
SOMEBODY THAT NOBODY EVER HEARD 
OF. 
HER NAME IS TINA SMITH. 
HONESTLY, YOU KNOW I DO THIS 
FOR A LIVING. 
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE EVER HEARD 
OF HER. 
THE FACT IS, THERE IS NO REASON 
FOR ME TO HAVE HEARD OF HER, 
BECAUSE SHE WILL NEVER VOTE FOR 
US. 
SHE WILL ALWAYS VOTE FOR 
SCHUMER AND PELOSI. 
AND OF COURSE, THE LEGENDARY 
LOW IQ MAXINE WATERS. 
LOW IQ PERSON. 
SHE WILL BE WITH SCHUMER AND DO 
WHATEVER HE WANTS. 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO? 
SHOULD I VOTE FOR HIGHER TAXES? 
YES. 
SHOULD I VOTE AGAINST THE WALL? 
WHICH IS HAPPENING, FOLKS. 
SHE VOTED AGAINST THE WALL. 
  
>> SO WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. 
WE STARTED IT. 
$1.6 BILLION. 
WE GOT ANOTHER $1.6 BILLION AND 
WE JUST GOT ANOTHER. 
WE ARE MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS 
ON THE WALL. 
A LOT OF PROGRESS. 
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT FASTER. 
I AM GOOD AT BUILDING. 
AND TINA VOTED FOR DEADLY 
SANCTUARY CITIES. 
DO YOU PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE 
VOTING FOR SANCTUARY CITIES, 
KARIN HOUSLEY?  
OKAY, GOOD. 
SHE WANTS TO KEEP CRIME OUT OF 
MINNESOTA. 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD 
PLATFORM. 
TINA SMITH WOULD RATHER PROTECT 
VIOLENT CRIMINALS THAN LOYAL 
AMERICANS. 
THAT IS WHY TINA SMITH, THAT 
NOBODY EVER HEARD OF, NEEDS TO 
BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE. 
SHE GOT APPOINTED, I GUESS. 
AND TINA SMITH IS VOTING 
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE? 
SO, HE WAS NUMBER ONE AT YALE. 
NUMBER ONE AT YALE LAW SCHOOL. 
I THINK SHE IS LOOKING FOR A 
BETTER STUDENT. 
FINALLY, I WANT TO INTRODUCE -- 
BY THE WAY, KARIN HOUSLEY, COME 
UP, PLEASE.  
  
>> YOU REALLY DO GO OFF SCRIPT, 
DON'T YOU? 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. 
HE SAID TINA SMITH WAY TOO MANY 
TIMES, YOU NEED TO SAY KARIN 
HOUSLEY A LOT MORE.  
THANK YOU. 
>> VOTE FOR HER. 
VOTE FOR KARIN HOUSLEY.  
NOW FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE 
HERE FOR. 
CONGRESS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND 
I AM HERE TO SUPPORT 
CONGRESSMAN JASON LEWIS, WHO 
YOU KNOW. 
HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS 
WORKED SO HARD FOR US AND SO 
HARD ON YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, 
WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE. 
AND SO HARD ON CUTTING YOUR 
TAXES AND REGULATIONS. 
JASON, THANK YOU. 
COME ON UP. 
THE NEXT REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
MINNESOTA'S FIRST DISTRICT, 
GEMMA, COME ON UP. 
-- DISTRICT, JIM, COME ON UP. 
WELCOME TO MINNESOTA, MISTER 
PRESIDENT. 
>> NOW EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM 
KNOWS MINNESOTA LOVES PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
BUT I WILL TELL YOU, IN 2020, 
WHEN HE COMES BACK HERE AND 
TAKES THE STATE, EVERY -- THE 
STATE, THE WHOLE WORLD WILL úKN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE 
MINNESOTA LOVES, MISTER 
PRESIDENT? 
THEY LOVE TAX CUTS THAT LET YOU 
KEEP MORE OF YOUR MONEY. 
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THAT IS 
REALLY IT, ISN'T IT? 
GROWTH IS GREAT. 
MORE JOB OPENINGS AND JOB 
SEEKERS. 
BUT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, 
WHOSE MONEY IS IT? 
IT IS YOURS. 
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE IT. 
MINNESOTA LOVES MANUFACTURING, 
MINING AND ENERGY PRODUCTION IN 
THE SECOND DISTRICT. 
MINNESOTA LOVES OUR FARMERS, 
NOW, THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT. 
WE HAVE FREE TRADE AND FAIR 
TRADE. 
RIGHT HERE IN ROCHESTER, 
MINNESOTA IS VERY PROUD AND 
LOVES HEALTHCARE. 
THE KIND OF PLANS THAT YOU 
CHOOSE, NOT THE PLANS THAT 
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CHOOSE 
FOR YOU. 
AND THAT IS WHY WE REPEALED THE 
OBAMA CARE MANDATE THE PRESIDENT
SIGNED INTO LAW. 
AND ONE MORE THING, MISTER 
PRESIDENT. 
MINNESOTA LOVES YOUR JUDICIAL 
APPOINTMENTS. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
MINNESOTA LOVES YOUR 
APPOINTMENTS TO THE LOWER 
COURTS. 
THEY LOVE YOUR APPOINTMENTS TO 
THE APPELLATE COURTS AND 
MINNESOTA LOVES YOUR 
APPOINTMENTS TO THE SUPREME 
COURT, INCLUDING JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
MY FRIENDS, MY FRIENDS, THAT IS 
WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS 
ELECTION. 
DUE PROCESS. 
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. 
THE RULE OF LAW. 
PRIVATE PROPERTY. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
AND IF NANCY PELOSI BECOME 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, YOU CAN 
THROW THAT ALL ASIDE. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THE RADICAL RESISTERS HAVE TO 
COME THROUGH MINNESOTA FIRST 
AND THIS IS WHERE IT STOPS. 
I AM NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.
JIM HAGEDORN IS NOT GOING TO 
LET IT HAPPEN AND PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO 
LET IT HAPPEN. 
THANK YOU ALL. 
ONTO NOVEMBER AND LET'S WIN 
THERE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WOW. 
ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA, SOUTHERN 
MINNESOTA LOVES THIS PRESIDENT. 
ABSOLUTELY. 
THINK BACK WHERE WE WERE JUST 
TWO YEARS AGO. 
OUR NATIONS FUTURE WAS ON THE 
LINE. 
IF WE HAD NOT WON THAT 
ELECTION, WE WOULD'VE LOST THE 
COUNTRY, THE WAY THE 
FOREFATHERS PUT IT TOGETHER. 
BY THE GRACE OF GOD, MISTER 
PRESIDENT YOU ARE HERE. 
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE 
DOING FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
I JUST WANT TO GIVE THE 
PRESIDENT A QUICK UPDATE ON THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IN MINNESOTA. 
THEY MOVED FAR TO THE LEFT, 
LIKE THE REST OF THE DEMOCRATS 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GUY RUNNING 
FOR GOVERNOR WHO WANTS TO MAKE 
MINNESOTA A SANCTUARY STATE. 
WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE RUNNING FOR 
THE U.S. SENATE ON THE DEMOCRAT 
PARTY. 
THEY LOVE LATE-TERM ABORTION 
AND THEY BELIEVE IN GUN CONTROL.
AND WE HAVE ALL THESE 
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES, 
INCLUDING THE GUY I AM RUNNING 
AGAINST, WHO THINK WE SHOULD 
HAVE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. 
SINGLE-PAYER. 
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE FOR THE 
MAYO CLINIC? 
NO. 
THEY WANT TO RESIST, THEY WANT 
TO TAKE US BACK TO OBAMA AND 
THEN SOME. 
ARE WE GOING TO LET THAT 
HAPPEN? 
NO. 
MISTER PRESIDENT, WE WILL WORK 
TIRELESSLY BECAUSE OF YOUR 
SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP AND 
ENDORSEMENT. 
I WANT TO GO OUT AND SERVE AS A 
CONSERVATIVE REINFORCEMENT TO 
PARTNER WITH YOU TO KEEP MOVING 
AMERICA IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. 
THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. 
  
>> WOW. 
WOW. 
GOOD TALENT. 
SO JASON AND JIM ARE BOTH 
RUNNING AGAINST EXTREME 
DEMOCRATS. 
JIM'S OPPONENT SUPPORTS A TOTAL 
GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF 
HEALTHCARE, WHICH DRIVES COSTS 
RIGHT THROUGH THE ROOF AND THE 
HEALTHCARE IS LOUSY, BY THE WAY.
  AND HE 
WANTS TO MAKE MINNESOTA INTO A 
SANCTUARY FOR THE CRIMINAL 
ALIENS AND FOUR GANG MEMBERS. 
THEY WILL COME FLOODING APPEAR, 
AS SOON AS YOU DO, IT HAPPENS 
EVERY TIME. 
JASON'S OPPONENT, ANGIE CRAIG, 
WHO IS SHE? 
ALSO ONCE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR 
HEALTHCARE. 
SHE REFUSES TO SUPPORT THE 
PIPELINE. 
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. 
THAT WOULD BRING MORE THAN 8000 
JOBS TO MINNESOTA. 
YOU KNOW WE HAVE REALLY OPENED 
UP MINNESOTA. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH 
THE MINES AND THE MINORS AND 
THE ORDER. 
WORST OF ALL, A VOTE FOR THEM 
IS A VOTE FOR NANCY PELOSI AS 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE NANCY PELOSI AS 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE? 
DON'T DO THAT TO ME. 
I DID NOT BUY INTO THAT. 
NEITHER DID YOU. 
IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CHARGE, 
MAXINE WATERS WILL ALSO -- 
LISTEN TO THIS. 
SHE WILL TAKE OVER FINANCIAL 
SERVICES IN CONGRESS. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
MAXINE WATERS. 
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL COMMITTEES IN CONGRESS.
IF YOU WANT TO STOP PELOSI FROM 
BECOMING SPEAKER. 
IF YOU WANT TO STOP CHUCK 
SCHUMER FROM BECOMING MAJORITY 
LEADER. 
AND IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE 
RADICAL DEMOCRATS FROM RUNNING 
CONGRESS, THEN YOU NEED TO VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT THERE ON 
NOVEMBER 6 AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE 
FOR THESE PEOPLE. 
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
A DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED CONGRESS 
WOULD ALSO CAUSE A GRAVE THREAT 
TO MEDICARE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING 
WITH MEDICARE. 
THEY WILL DESTROY IT. 
THE MAJORITY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE COSPONSORED A SOCIALIST 
TAKEOVER OF HEALTHCARE THAT 
WOULD OBLITERATE MEDICARE. 
THEIR PLAN IS CALLED MEDICARE 
FOR ALL. 
EXCEPT THEY HAVE NO MONEY. 
BUT IT IS REALLY MEDICARE FOR 
NONE. 
THEIR PLAN WOULD ROB AMERICAN 
SENIORS OF THE BENEFITS THEY 
HAVE PAID. 
THEY PAID THESE BENEFITS. 
THEY PAID SO MUCH MONEY FOR 
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. 
YOU TAKE IT AWAY. 
THANK YOU, DARLING. 
I LOVE THESE PEOPLE. 
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT 
MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS WHO 
HAVE EARNED IT AND PAID FOR IT. 
AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT 
AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING 
CONDITIONS. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
THEM. 
SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT ENDING PRE-
EXISTING CONDITIONS AND I SAY, 
LET'S GET A LITTLE MORE MONEY 
FROM CHINA, IT WILL BE JUST 
FINE. 
IT WILL BE JUST FINE. 
IT WILL BE JUST FINE. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
PRE-EXISTIN CONDITIONS, 
REMEMBER THAT. 
THE LEAD SPONSOR OF THE 
DEMOCRATS, THE HEALTHCARE 
TAKEOVER, WHO IS THE LEAD 
SPONSOR? 
I HAVE BEEN READING SO MUCH 
ABOUT HIM. 
HE DID PREDICT I WAS GOING TO 
WIN. 
THAT IS THE ONLY THING HE GOT 
RIGHT. 
KEITH ELLISON. 
NO, HE DID. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
HE WAS ON THE SHOW THE DAY 
AFTER I ANNOUNCED. 
ON JUNE 16, I CAME DOWN WITH 
MELANIA, WHO IS NOW IN AFRICA, 
OUR FIRST LADY. 
DOING A GREAT JOB FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF AFRICA. 
AMAZING. 
BUT ELLISON WAS ON THE SHOW THE 
DAY AFTER I ANNOUNCED AND HE 
LOOKED AT THE HOSTS AND HE 
SAID, YOU KNOW HE IS GOING TO 
WIN, DON'T YOU? 
AND THEY SMILED. 
ONE LAUGHED. 
THEY THOUGHT I WAS JUST DOING 
THIS FOR FUN. 
DO YOU THINK THIS IS FUN? 
THIS IS A LOT OF WORK. 
A LOT MORE WORK THAN ANYBODY 
KNEW. 
THAT IS THE LAST TIME HE HAS 
BEEN RIGHT, BUT I AM GLAD HE 
WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT. 
ELLISON IS THE NUMBER TWO 
OFFICIAL IN THE ENTIRE DEMOCRAT 
PARTY AND HE RECENTLY MARCHED 
IN A PARADE WEARING A SHIRT 
THAT SAID I DO NOT BELIEVE IN 
BORDERS. 
THAT IS WONDERFUL. 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORDERS, YOU 
DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. 
YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. 
KEITH ELLISON'S DEMOCRAT PARTY 
EMBRACES RADICAL SOCIALISM AND 
OPEN BORDERS. 
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH 
I.C.E. 
THEY WANT TO UNLEASH VIOLENT 
PREDATORS AND RUTHLESS KILLERS 
AND YOU KNOW IT. 
SOMEONE WOULD SAY, WHY IS HE 
SAYING THAT? 
IT IS TRUE. 
LIKE MS-13. 
NEAR OUR SCHOOLS. 
NEAR OUR FAMILY SEND INTO OUR 
COMMUNITIES. 
NO GOOD. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE AMERICA 
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-
ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL 
ALIENS. 
AND REPUBLICANS PROUDLY STAND 
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
I.C.E., BORDER PATROL AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
OUR POLICE. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO 
REFORMED OUR REFUGEE PROGRAM TO 
PROTECT AMERICAN COMMUNITIES 
LIKE YOU HAVE IN MINNESOTA, 
WHERE YOU ARE BEING TREATED 
VERY UNFAIRLY. 
AND TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES 
AND YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. 
IF YOU WANT SECURITY. 
IF YOU WANT A BORDER, THAN WHAT 
YOU HAVE TO DO IS IMMEDIATELY 
GO OUT, THINK ABOUT IT, GET 
YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS. 
YOU HAVE TO GO NOVEMBER 6, VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 
WE NEED THE VOTES. 
I KEEP HEARING WE HAVE A 
MAJORITY. 
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, WE 
DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY. 
IF SOMEONE IS NOT FEELING 
GREAT, WE DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY.
THAT IS WHY WE ARE GETTING THE 
WALL, BY HOOK AND BY CROOK, BUT 
IT IT IS -- BUT IT IS SO 
DIFFICULT. 
THESE GUYS WANT TO STOP IT. 
WE GOT $700 BILLION FOR THE 
MILITARY. 
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. 
BUT TO GET MONEY FOR THE WALL, 
THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS TRYING TO 
OBSTRUCT THE WALL, BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW WE WANT IT. 
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS NOT 
WORKING. 
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT A LOT 
FASTER, BUT IT IS NOT WORKING. 
YOU THINK IT IS EASY? 
IT IS NOT EASY. 
WE ARE GETTING IT BUILT AND IT 
IS ALREADY GOING UP IN SAN 
DIEGO AND LOTS OF OTHER PLACES 
ALONG THE BORDER. 
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SAFETY 
AND IT IS ABOUT PROSPERITY. 
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE 
CREATED OVER 400 MILLION NEW 
JOBS. 
THE MEDIA WILL TELL YOU THERE 
IS NO WAY WE COULD HAVE SAID 
THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN. 
NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT. 
AND WE HAVE LIFTED 4 MILLION 
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 
THINK OF THAT. 
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU 
SAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU 
ALSO MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
REALLY HAPPY. 
WE HAVE ADDED NEARLY A HALF 1 
MILLION NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
REMEMBER, YOU NEED A MAGIC 
WAND, YOU WILL NEVER DO THAT. 
I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER, WE 
NEVER BUILD ANYTHING ANYMORE? 
WE HAVE COMPANIES POURING INTO 
OUR COUNTRY. 
INTO MINNESOTA. 
WE HAVE COMPANIES COMING BACK. 
THEY WANT TO BE WHERE THE 
ACTION IS. 
THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. 
THE AUTO COMPANIES. 
I WAS WITH PRIME MINISTER ABE A 
COUPLE DAYS AGO. 
HE SAID MANY OF THE AUTO 
COMPANIES ARE COMING BACK. 
I SAID THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, 
THEY ALL HAVE TO COME BACK. 
THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK. 
THEY HAVE STARTED. 
WHAT IS COMING -- WHAT IS GOING 
ON IN MICHIGAN, THEY ARE COMING 
BACK SO FAST. 
SOUTH CAROLINA, NORTH CAROLINA. 
THEY ARE COMING INTO A PLACE 
CALLED MINNESOTA. 
WE LOVE MINNESOTA. 
  
>> 1972, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? 
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME. I CAME 
SO CLOSE. 
I WOULD HAVE WON THIS STATE. 
DO YOU REMEMBER? 
I SAID, I THINK I AM GOING TO 
WIN MINNESOTA. 
EVERYONE SAID NO, NO, IT HAS 
NOT BEEN ONE SINCE 1972. 
RIGHT? 
YEAH, 1972. 
IT HAS NOT BEEN ONE. 
I SAID, NO, LOOK AT THE CROWDS. 
THEY LOVE IT. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
MINNESOTA AND STOP WHAT IS 
HAPPENING THAT IS SO UNFAIR IN 
MINNESOTA. 
AND THEN ON ELECTION NIGHT I 
SAID LET'S GO TO MINNESOTA. 
THEY ALREADY SCHEDULED A GREAT 
PLACE, A GREAT STATE, MICHIGAN. 
THAT IS ANOTHER ONE THAT HAD 
NOT BEEN ONE IN MANY YEARS. 
I WENT TO MICHIGAN. 
WE HAD 32,000 PEOPLE IN 
MICHIGAN AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING.
I HAD TO SKIP MINNESOTA. 
I FELT SO BADLY. 
ONE MORE SPEECH, I COULD HAVE 
SHOWN UP AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING 
AND GOT THEM. 
BUT WE ARE GOING TO WIN. 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN MINNESOTA. 
YOU SEE THAT, JUST BY THIS 
CROWD. 
LOOK AT THIS CROWD. 
SO SOMETHING I AM VERY PROUD OF
. AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT 
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE 
EVER RECORDED. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS 
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER 
RECORDED. 
THINK OF THOSE TWO SOUNDBITES. 
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT, THE 
LOWEST RATE OF POVERTY. 
THINK OF THIS. 
HOW DOES YOUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
VOTE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE? 
I HAVE DONE MORE FOR THEM IN 
TWO YEARS. 
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE COMING UP 
AND SAYING, MISTER PRESIDENT, 
THANK YOU. 
AND THEIR MEDIAN INCOME IS THE 
HIGHEST. 
NOT ONLY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, 
ASIANS, HISPANICS. 
  
>> HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE 
LOWEST IT HAS EVER BEEN. 
THINK OF IT. 
ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT, THE LOWEST 
IT HAS EVER BEEN. 
PEOPLE WITH NO HIGH SCHOOL 
DIPLOMA, THAT IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT GROUP OF PEOPLE TO 
ME, IT IS BY FAR THE LOWEST IT 
HAS EVER BEEN. 
WOMEN I AM FAILING WITH. 
I AM FAILING WITH WOMEN. 
IT IS ONLY THE LOWEST IN 65 
YEARS. 
SORRY. 
SORRY. 
  I 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HISTORY BY 
NOW, BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SAYING 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HERE. I'VE 
BEEN SAYING ASIAN. 
AND WOMEN, ONLY THE LOWEST IN 
65 YEARS. 
I THOUGHT BY NOW IT WOULD BE 
OKAY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
A LOT OF ENERGY OVER THERE. 
SHE HAS A LOT OF ENERGY. 
THANK YOU, DARLING. 
THANK YOU. 
65 YEARS, NOT BAD. 
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN THE 
TOUGHEST EVER ACTION, CRACKING 
DOWN ON CHINA'S TRADE ABUSES. 
WE HAVE TO STOP IT. 
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP,
BUT WE CAN'T ALLOW WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED OVER SO MANY YEARS TO 
CONTINUE HAPPENING. 
THEY HAVE TAKEN $500 BILLION 
OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND REBUILT 
CHINA. 
I SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT 
ANYMORE, I AM SORRY. 
I AM SORRY. 
FOR YEARS, CHINA HAS BEEN 
DRAINING US. 
TAKING OUR FACTORIES AND 
BUILDING UP THEIR COUNTRY, WITH 
OUR MONEY. 
AND AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR 
WORKERS AND OUR COMPANIES. 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT. 
NO MORE. 
AND NOT ONLY CHINA, MANY 
COUNTRIES. 
WE DEFEND COUNTRIES THAT ARE 
VERY RICH. 
THEY DON'T PAY US OR THEY PAY 
US A SMALL PERCENTAGE. 
LOOK, WE GET ALONG GREAT WITH 
THESE COUNTRIES. 
BUT TAKE SAUDI ARABIA, WE 
DEFEND THEM AND THEY PAY A 
SMALL PERCENTAGE. 
I SAID EXCUSE ME, KING SOLOMON, 
HE IS MY FRIEND. 
DO YOU MIND PAYING FOR THE 
MILITARY? 
DO YOU MIND? 
HEY. 
THEY ARE PAYING FOR 30%. 
I SAID DO YOU MIND PAYING? 
BUT NOBODY HAS ASKED ME. 
I SAID, BUT I AM ASKING YOU. 
HE HAS GREAT. 
HE SAID, ARE YOU SERIOUS? 
I SAID NO, I AM TOTALLY SERIOUS.
TRUST ME. 
AND THEY WILL DO IT. 
HE SAID NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED 
THEM. 
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD NEVER 
HAVE ASKED, THAT IS NOT HIS 
THING. 
WHY WOULD SOMEONE ASK TO BE 
PAID BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS? 
JAPAN, VERY RICH, VERY GREAT 
COUNTRY. 
PRIME MINISTER ABE, A GREAT 
MAN. 
JUST ONE FANTASTIC COLLECTION. 
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. 
I SAID TO HIM, LISTEN, WE ARE 
DEFENDING YOU. 
WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 
THEY WERE SENDING MISSILES OVER 
JAPAN FROM NORTH KOREA. 
BECAUSE OF ME, THOSE AREN'T 
GOING OVER JAPAN ANYMORE. 
THERE ARE NO MORE MISSILES, NO 
MORE TESTING, NO MORE NUCLEAR. 
WE HAVE OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 
WE GET THE REMAINS OF OUR GREAT 
HEROES BACK. 
THERE REMAINS. 
THE REMAINS ARE COMING BACK. 
IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL 
CEREMONY. 
DID ANYONE SEE THAT CEREMONY A 
MONTH AGO? 
SO BEAUTIFUL. 
THE REMAINS ARE COMING BACK. 
WHAT DO I GET? 
I GET THE FAKE NEWS SAYING, WHY 
ISN'T HE MOVING FASTER? 
THREE MONTHS AGO I HAD A 
MEETING IN SINGAPORE. 
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 75 
YEARS. 
LET'S SAY 25 YEARS WITH THE 
MISSILES AND THE NUCLEAR, BUT 
NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE ANYTHING. 
IT IS LIKE THREE MONTHS. 
THEN THEY WILL SAY THE ALL-TIME 
GREAT, WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG? 
I SAID IT HAS BEEN THREE MONTHS 
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ROCKETS AND 
YOU DON'T HAVE MISSILES AND YOU 
DON'T HAVE NUCLEAR TESTING. 
IT IS CRAZY. 
BUT HERE IS WHAT THEY SAY. 
THEY CAN'T GET ME. 
ONE OF THEM, A NICE GUY, A 
FRIEND OF MINE SAID, WHY IS THE 
PRESIDENT GIVING SO MUCH TO 
NORTH KOREA? 
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING. 
I DIDN'T PAY $1.8 BILLION FOR 
THE HOSTAGES, LIKE OBAMA DID. 
$1.8 BILLION IN CASH. 
SO I HAVE NOT GIVEN, BUT I HAVE 
A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CHAIRMAN KIM. 
I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
BECAUSE OF THAT, I THINK WE 
WILL WORK SOMETHING OUT. 
MAYBE WE WELL, MAYBE WE WON'T, 
BUT LET'S SEE. 
THREE MONTHS AGO, MAYBE LESS 
AND THEY ARE SAYING, HE AGREED 
TO MEET. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I GAVE HIM? 
I AGREED TO MEET, THAT IS WHAT 
THEY SAID. 
IS THAT A BIG DEAL? 
I AGREED TO MEET. 
I ASKED THE DEMOCRATS. 
WE WERE CLOSE TO A WAR WITH 
NORTH KOREA AND MY RHETORIC WAS 
VERY TOUGH AT THE BEGINNING. 
REALLY, REALLY TOUGH. 
IN FACT, THEY ALL SAID, I AM 
GOING TO CAUSE A WAR WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
THEN WITH PUTIN OF RUSSIA, HE 
SAID -- THEY SAID, HE WAS TOO 
NICE. 
THEY WANT ME TO GET INTO A 
BOXING MATCH WITH HIM. 
I THINK I WOULD DO VERY WELL. 
WITH RUSSIA. 
NO. 
IT IS THE FAKE NEWS. 
FAKE NEWS. 
THEY SAID WITH RUSSIA, HE WAS 
TOO NICE. 
WITH NORTH KOREA, THEY SAID HE 
WAS TOO TOUGH. 
TOO TOUGH. 
LET ME TELL YOU, IF I WAS 
REALLY ROUGH WITH RUSSIA,THEY 
WOULD SAY HE WAS TOO TOUGH. 
THESE PEOPLE ARE LOCO, I AM 
TELLING YOU. 
PEOPLE ARE CRAZY. 
FAKE NEWS. 
THE FAKE NEWS, EVERYBODY. 
THEY ARE FAKE. 
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING, 
FOREIGN NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY 
REBUILDING OUR NATION. 
RIGHT? 
TO GIVE OUR WORKERS AND 
BUSINESSES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
. REPUBLICANS PASSED THE 
BIGGEST PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND 
TAX REFORMS IN THE HISTORY OF 
OUR COUNTRY. 
BETTER VOTE FOR KARIN HOUSLEY, 
THEY WANT TO TAKE THEM AWAY.  
THEY WANT TO TAKE THEM AWAY. 
WE HAVE TAKEN HAS STORE AND -- 
TAKEN HISTORIC ACTION TO MAKE 
HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE. 
AND THE PREMIUMS UNDER 
OBAMACARE, THEY WERE GOING UP 
116%. 
138%. 
200%. 
THROUGH GREAT MANAGEMENT AND 
GREAT PEOPLE, WE HAVE KEPT THEM 
DOWN. 
WE MOSTLY OBLITERATED OBAMACARE,
ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T WON, EXCEPT 
2:00 IN THE MORNING. 
KNOWS I AM NOT GOING TO DO IT, 
TO A CLOCK IN THE MORNING. 
BUT THINK OF IT DIFFERENTLY. 
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT 
VOTE, SO WE ARE STUCK WITH IT, 
BUT IT IS OBLITERATED. 
THE BIG THING IS WE GOT RID OF 
THE MOST UNPOPULAR PART, THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WHERE YOU 
HAVE A PRIVILEGE OF PAYING A 
FORTUNE, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
PAY A FORTUNE FOR HORRIBLE 
HEALTHCARE, RIGHT? 
1025 SO THE PREMIUMS IN 
MINNESOTA THIS YEAR ARE COMING 
DOWN BY DOUBLE DIGITS. 
THINK OF THAT. 
I DO NOT EVEN LIKE THE STUFF, 
BUT WHILE WE HAVE THE REMNANTS 
OF OBAMACARE, WE ARE LOOKING TO 
MAKE IT MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE 
THEN YOU HAD AND TO REDUCE DRUG 
PRICES. 
THE FDA HAS APPROVED A RECORD 
NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE GENERIC 
MEDICINES. 
THAT IS NOT ALL. 
DRUG PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. 
YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN LAST MONTH 
WHERE I CALLED UP SOME OF THE 
DRUG COMPANIES. 
YOU RAISED THE PRICES, YOU 
CAN'T DO THAT. 
AND THEY ALL REDUCED THEM. 
YOU BELIEVE IT? 
THAT IS WHEN I SAID, I HAVE A 
LOT OF POWER. 
PFIZER, NOVARTIS, THEY RAISED 
THEIR DRUG PRICES AND I AM 
BRINGING THEM DOWN. 
I SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH 
RAISING THEM? 
I AM SORRY MISTER PRESIDENT, WE 
WILL REDUCE THEM IMMEDIATELY. 
MAN, THIS IS A POWERFUL 
POSITION. 
THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY 
OF DRUG COMPANIES THAT THEY 
HAVE DONE THAT. 
I CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM I 
WAS EXTREMELY UNHAPPY. 
THEY SAID THEY WOULD REDUCE IT. 
WHO DOES THAT? 
DO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON 
WOULD HAVE DONE THAT? 
I DON'T THINK SO. 
  
>> BY THE WAY, SHE OR WHOEVER 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, CRAZY 
BERNIE, WHOEVER THEY PUT IN, 
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE ANY OF 
THE THINGS. 
WE DID THE GREATEST TRADE DEAL. 
WE DID 4.2% GDP. 
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD -4%. 
THEY SAID 4.2% WAS IMPOSSIBLE. 
IT IS GOING TO GO MUCH HIGHER. 
WE HAVE SUCH POTENTIAL BETWEEN 
MILITARY AND TRADE DEALS. 
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS WORTH OF FAT AND 
POTENTIAL. 
AND WHAT I LOVE, WHAT I LOVE, 
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T NEED IT FOR 
A LONG TIME OR NEVER, TO HELP 
CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS GET 
LIFE-SAVING TREATMENTS, WE 
PASSED RIGHT TO TRY. 
I LOVE IT. 
I HOPE YOU DON'T NEED IT. 
I HOPE I DON'T NEED IT, TOO. 
I HOPE YOU DON'T NEED IT, BUT 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST, FRANKLY 
THE GREATEST DRUG COMPANIES IN 
THE WORLD. 
AND WE HAVE DRUGS THAT WOULD 
TAKE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS. 
WE BROUGHT IT DOWN FROM 14 
YEARS TO GET APPROVED, DOWN TO 
FOUR YEARS. 
I THINK WE WILL GET IT DOWN TO 
THREE OR TWO. 
BUT STILL, YOU HAVE TO WAIT A 
LONG TIME. 
A PERSON WAS DYING, THEY ARE 
TERMINALLY ILL AND THEY HAVE A 
POSSIBLE CURE. 
A PERSON WANTS TO SEE. 
THERE WAS NO WAY OF GETTING IT. 
I WORKED WITH CONGRESS, 
INCLUDING THESE GUYS. 
AND GREG. 
AND GREG. 
RIGHT? 
AND JIM AND MARK AND THE WHOLE 
GROUP. 
WE WORKED WITH CONGRESS AND WE 
GOT IT DONE. 
I LOVE THE NAME, RIGHT TO TRY. 
NOW, THEY CAN GO. 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, THEY HAVE 
BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS FOR 40 
YEARS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR 40 
YEARS. 
AND IT IS. 
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH 
INSURANCE COMPANIES, PROBLEMS 
WITH TRIALS, PROBLEMS WITH SO 
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. 
PROBLEMS WITH EVERYTHING. 
AND YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH 
LIABILITY. 
SIGN THE DOCUMENT. THERE IS NO 
LIABILITY. 
THE PERSON DIES AND THEY SUE 
THE COUNTRY, THAT IS NO GOOD. 
SO YOU SIGN AWAY YOUR RIGHT. 
EVERYONE SAID THIS IS A GOOD 
IDEA. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? 
AFTER 40 YEARS WE HAVE IT AND 
PEOPLE ARE TRYING IT AND WE 
HAVE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE 
RESULTS. 
IT IS ALSO TELLING YOU WHETHER 
OR NOT THIS STUFF WORKS. 
THERE IS SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT 
THAT, TOO. 
WE HAVE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE 
RESULTS. 
I LOVE IT. 
PEOPLE WOULD FLY TO OTHER 
CONTINENTS AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 
IF THEY WERE POOR, THEY WOULD 
JUST GO AWAY. 
THEY HAVE NO HOPE. 
THEY WOULD GO TO THEIR HOUSE OR 
APARTMENT AND THEY WOULD HAVE 
NO HOPE. 
NOW THEY HAVE HOPE. 
IT IS BEAUTIFUL. 
IT IS SO GREAT. 
WE ALSO PASSED VETERANS CHOICE, 
GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT 
TO SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR. 
CA PRIVATE DOCTOR, INSTEAD OF 
WAITING IN LINE. 
WE HAD PEOPLE WAITING FOR TWO 
WEEKS, THREE WEEKS, 12 DAYS, 
NINE WEEKS. 
WE HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT VERY 
SICK. 
IT TOOK THEM SO LONG TO SEE A 
DOCTOR. 
A VETERANS DOCTOR. 
THEY ARE VERY GOOD DOCTORS. 
WE REALLY DO HAVE GOOD DOCTORS, 
BUT IT IS A LONG PROCESS. 
BY THE TIME THEY WOULD SEE THE 
DOCTOR, 22 DAYS LATER, THEY 
WOULD BE TERMINALLY ILL. 
THINK OF IT. 
THEY WOULD DIE. 
THEY WOULD DIE IN LINE WAITING. 
THEY NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO 
TO A PRIVATE DOCTOR AND WE PAY 
THE BILL. 
44 YEARS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET 
IT. 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY IDEA. 
I SAID I HAVE THE GREATEST 
IDEA. 
I SAID WELL MY MEDICAL PEOPLE, 
I HAVE THE GREATEST IDEA. 
IT HAS TAKEN TOO LONG. 
TOO MANY PEOPLE, TOO FEW 
DOCTORS. 
THEY ARE GREAT DOCTORS, BUT YOU 
CAN'T GET TO THEM. 
I HAVE THE GREATEST IDEA, WE 
WILL HAVE PEOPLE GO TO PRIVATE 
DOCTORS. 
THEY SAID SIR, WE HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ON THIS FOR 44 YEARS. 
BUT I GOT IT APPROVED, BECAUSE 
I AM GOOD AT GETTING THINGS 
APPROVED. 
IT IS ALL DONE. 
ALL DONE. 
AND THESE PEOPLE HELPED ME, 
RIGHT THERE. 
THEY HELPED ME WITH IT. 
RIGHT THERE. 
AND WE ALSO PASSED LANDMARK VA 
ACCOUNTABILITY LAW TO INSURE 
ANYONE WHO MISTREATS OUR 
VETERANS WILL BE HELD 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
WE SAY, JIM, YOU'RE FIRED, GET 
OUT. 
OUT, GET OUT. 
WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO IT. 
BETWEEN THE UNIONS AND THE 
CIVIL SERVANTS, THEY COULD DO 
ANYTHING. 
THEY COULD BE SADISTS AND THEY 
WERE. 
THESE ARE SICK PEOPLE. 
THEY CAN BE SEE DISCS, -- CAN 
BE SADISTS, THEY CAN BE 
STEALING, YOU COULDN'T DO 
ANYTHING. 
THEY WERE TOTALLY PROTECTED. 
NOW YOU JUST FIRE THEM. 
GET THEM OUT. 
WE SECURED A RECORD $716 
BILLION TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY 
AND GIVE OUR BRAVE WARRIORS 
THEIR LARGEST PAY RAISE IN A 
DECADE. 
AND AT MY DIRECTION, THE 
PENTAGON IS NOW WORKING, I AM 
SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS, TO 
CREATE THE SIX THE BRANCH. 
NUMBER SIX. 
OF THE AMERICAN ARMED FORCES, 
CALLED THE SPACE FORCE. 
WE HAVE THE AIR FORCE. 
NOW WE HAVE THE SPACE FORCE. 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-SIDED 
IRAN NUCLEAR DISASTER DEAL. 
AND WE OPENED THE AMERICAN 
EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
  
PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN PROMISING 
THAT FOR MANY, MANY DECADES. 
I FINALLY KNOW WHY, BECAUSE I 
WAS HIT SO HARD WHEN THEY HEARD 
I WAS GOING TO DO IT. 
I GOT CALLS FROM EVERY COUNTRY 
IN THE WORLD. 
PLEASE DON'T DO IT. 
I TOLD YOU THIS STORY. 
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CALLS 
FOR MANY LEADERS OF ANY 
COUNTRIES. 
TELL THEM I WILL CALL THEM BACK.
I SAID, TELL THEM I WILL CALL 
THEM BACK NEXT WEEK. 
BECAUSE THEY WERE CALLING ME. 
THEY WERE SAYING, MISTER 
PRESIDENT, PLEASE DON'T DO 
THAT. 
PLEASE, PLEASE. 
I KNOW WHY OBAMA AND BUSH AND 
EVERYBODY DIDN'T DO IT. 
I UNDERSTAND. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE, SO 
I SAID TELL THEM I WILL CALL 
THEM BACK NEXT WEEK. 
SO ON MONDAY I SIGNED IT AND ON 
TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, I 
CALLED EVERYBODY BACK. 
HOW ARE YOU DOING, WHAT IS UP? 
WELL, WE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO DO. 
I'M SORRY, IT'S TOO LATE. 
WHAT CAN I DO? 
WHAT CAN I DO? 
WHAT CAN I DO? 
FOR YEARS YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 
NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS 
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. 
  
>> WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR 
MINNESOTA AND WE ARE STANDING 
PROUDLY FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.
  
  
>> I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK 
STORY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW, 
THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD. 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. 
I THOUGHT THEY KNEW EVERYTHING 
ABOUT ME. 
IN MAKING THE DEAL WITH MEXICO 
AND CANADA. 
AS YOU KNOW, CANADA WAS VERY 
TOUGH BUT THEY WORKED OUT FINE. 
WE TALK ABOUT IT AND I AM NOT 
HAPPY WITH IT, THE NFL, OKAY? 
PEOPLE SHOULD STAND, PROUDLY, 
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
SO I AM NOT HAPPY. 
I AM NOT HAPPY. 
BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING 
OUT. 
DID YOU NOTICE, THAT SEEMS TO 
BE WORKING OUT VERY GOOD. 
SO, WE ARE MAKING THE DEAL WITH 
CANADA AND IT IS BIG STUFF. 
IT IS CARS AND FARMING AND 
AGRICULTURE AND FACTORIES AND 
BIG, BIG DOLLARS. 
TREMENDOUS. 
THEY SAY IT IS THE LARGEST 
TRADE DEAL EVER MADE. 
$1.3 TRILLION. 
BUT I HEARD THE NFL HAD A BIG 
PROBLEM WITH CANADA ON THEIR 
ADVERTISING. 
ON THE COMMERCIALS. 
A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. 
I WON'T GET INTO IT, IT WAS A 
VERY BAD PROBLEM. 
IT WAS REALLY HURTING THE NFL. 
I DON'T CARE. 
IT IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY. 
A GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY. 
SO DURING THE NEGOTIATION, I 
SAID YOU HAVE TO FIX THE NFL 
PROBLEM. 
THEY SAID WHAT?  
IT TOOK ME TWO MINUTES AND NOW 
THE NFL IS SO HAPPY. 
IT HAS ALL WORKED OUT. 
IT HAS ALL WORKED OUT. 
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT. 
IT HAS ALL WORKED OUT. 
GOT TO FIX IT. 
AND OUR COUNTRY WILL TAKE TENS 
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MORE 
MONEY. 
A LOT OF IT WILL GO TO THE 
PLAYERS AND THEY STILL HATE ME, 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
THINK OF IT, IT TOOK ME TWO 
MINUTES. 
YOU HAVE TO FIX THE PROBLEM. 
NOT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THEM, 
I DO LIKE THEM. 
IT IS A GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY. 
I SAID YOU HAVE TO FIX THE NFL 
PROBLEM. 
IT IS UNFAIR WHAT YOU DO TO 
THEM DURING THE SUPER BOWL. 
VERY UNFAIR. 
AND I GOT A CALL FROM ROGER 
GOODELL. 
NO. 
VERY NICE. 
I FIGURED HE WAS CALLING ABOUT 
THE FLAG, TO SAY, COULD YOU 
LEAVE US ALONE PLEASE? 
AND HE WASN'T. 
HE SAID MISTER PRESIDENT, I 
WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR 
WHAT YOU DID. 
YOU SOLVED A PROBLEM THAT WAS 
GOING ON FOR YEARS. 
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 
COULDN'T DO IT. 
NOBODY COULD DO IT. 
NO ONE COULD GET IT DONE. 
I DID IT IN TWO MINUTES. 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 
IT WAS A TINY PART OF THE DEAL. 
I FIGURED, IT WAS ONLY TWO 
SENTENCES. 
IT WAS VERY NICE. 
ROGER GOODELL CALLED ME, THEN 
BOB KRAFT. 
A GREAT OWNER. 
IT IS GREAT TO HAVE COACH 
BELICHICK AND TOM BRADY. 
THAT IS A GOOD THING. 
I SAY YOU ARE A GREAT OWNER AND 
ONE OF THE LUCKIEST MAN ON 
EARTH. 
TOM BRADY IN THE SIXTH ROUND. 
AND YOU HAVE THE GREATEST COACH 
IN FOOTBALL. 
THAT IS A GREAT THING AND HE IS 
A GREAT GUY. 
BUT HE CALLED ME TO THANK ME 
AND ROGER GOODELL CALLED ME TO 
THANK ME. 
WE ARE ALL FRIENDS. 
I WANT WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE 
COUNTRY. 
IT IS TRUE. 
ONE OF MY KILLERS CALLED UP. 
WE HAVE TOUGH NEGOTIATORS. 
SMART GUYS. 
LIKE THE A-TEAM OF THE WORLD. 
HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THE NFL, 
EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT IT FOR 
YEARS. 
HE SAID I THINK WE COULD FIX 
THAT NFL DEAL. 
I SAID, LET'S FIX IT. 
THEY SAID, REALLY, YOU WANT TO 
DO THAT? 
THEY ARE A GREAT AMERICAN 
COMPANY. 
THEY WILL PAY TAXES ON THAT 
MONEY. 
THEY WILL PAY PEOPLE WHO LIVE 
AND WORK IN OUR COUNTRY. 
I SAID FIX IT. 
THEY FIXED IT AND IT WAS A NICE 
THING. 
OKAY, ENOUGH OF THAT. 
THAT IS ENOUGH OF THAT, REALLY. 
SO, THE NFL. 
GOOD COMPANY. 
GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. 
WE ARE LIFTING MILLIONS OF OUR 
CITIZENS, YOU KNOW THIS, FROM 
WELFARE TO WORK. 
FROM DEPENDENCE TO INDEPENDENCE 
AND FROM POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. 
THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE COMING 
OUT OF PRISONS AND THEY ARE 
ABLE TO GET JOBS NOW. 
ISN'T THAT GREAT? 
THEY ARE GETTING A SECOND 
CHANCE AND EVEN A THIRD CHANCE 
AND THEY ARE GETTING JOBS. 
PEOPLE THAT ARE HIRING, MANY OF 
THESE PRISONERS ARE SAYING, 
UNBELIEVABLE HOW GOOD THEY ARE. 
BEFORE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A 
CHANCE. 
THEY ARE HIRING PEOPLE COMING 
OUT OF PRISON AND THESE PEOPLE 
ARE STEPPING UP. 
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HIRED QUITE 
A FEW AND HE SAID THESE PEOPLE 
ARE UNBELIEVABLE. 
THEY ARE SO HARD-WORKING. 
WE HAVE GIVEN THEM A SECOND 
CHANCE. 
TO ME, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING. 
BUT TO CONTINUE OUR INCREDIBLE 
MOMENTUM, YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR 
FRIENDS AND GET YOUR FAMILY AND 
GET YOUR NEIGHBORS AND YOUR 
COWORKERS AND GET OUT, NOVEMBER 
6, YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
SEND JASON LEWIS AND JIM 
HAGEDORN TO THE HOUSE AND VOTE 
TO SEND KARIN HOUSLEY . GET 
KARIN HOUSLEY INTO THE SENATE.  
WE NEED HER. 
WE NEED HER VOTE. 
WE NEED HER. 
SHE IS GOING TO BE FANTASTIC. 
FORGET ABOUT TINA. 
KARIN HOUSLEY, THEY ARE GOING 
TO GET YOU IN. 
A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE FOR LOWER TAXES, LESS 
REGULATION  AND MORE PRODUCTS 
MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE GOOD OLD 
USA. 
IT IS A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR 
BORDERS, RESPECT OUR 
CONSTITUTION AND TO LOVE AND 
RESPECT THE HEROES OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
GREAT. 
GREAT. 
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
NO EASY JOB. 
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT 
POLITICS OF ANGER, DIVISION AND 
DISTRACTION. 
IT IS DESTRUCTION. 
AND TO UNITE TOGETHER AS 
CITIZENS, AS PATRIOTS, AND AS 
AMERICANS. 
TO EVERYONE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL, 
BIG, RICH ROOM. 
TO EVERY CITIZEN WATCHING 
ACROSS OUR LAND. 
THIS IS YOUR TIME TO CHOOSE. 
IT IS A TIME TO CHOOSE WHETHER 
WE TURN BACKWARD TO THE FAILURE 
AND FRUSTRATIONS OF THE PAST, 
OR WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD 
INTO A FUTURE OF AMERICAN 
GREATNESS. 
  IT IS 
NOT UP TO THE MEDIA OR TO THE 
POND AND'S TO DECIDE YOUR FATE. 
-- TO THE MEDIA OR THE PUNDITS 
TO DECIDE YOUR FATE. 
IT IS UP TO YOU. 
2016, ALL THOSE HATS, MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
LOOK AT THEM. 
THE GREATEST MOVEMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
IT IS. 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOVEMENT 
LIKE THIS. 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN. 
AS AN EXAMPLE, THE PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION IS NOT FOR 2 1/2 
YEARS. 
LOOK AT THIS ROOM. 
LOOK OUTSIDE. 
THIS IS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION. 
THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVEMENT 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 
AND THEY KNOW IT. 
AND THEY DON'T EVEN CHALLENGE 
ME WHEN I SAY IT. 
IF IT WAS WRONG, THERE WOULD BE 
HEADLINES. 
DONALD TRUMP. 
IT IS UP TO THE PROUD PEOPLE OF 
OUR COUNTRY AND THE VERY PROUD 
PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, A GREAT 
STATE. 
YOU HAVE THE POWER WITH YOU TO 
DEFEND AMERICA'S HONOR AND 
RECLAIM AMERICA'S FUTURE. 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER 
WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. 
RETURNING POWER TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
  THIS 
DATE WAS SETTLED BY TOUGH 
PIONEER MEN AND STRONG PIONEER 
WOMEN. WHO BRAVED THE 
WILDERNESS TO BUILD A LIFE AND 
BUILD A HOME. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY. 
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON. 
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES. 
THEY LOVED THEIR COUNTRY AND 
THEY LOVED THEIR GOD. 
THESE COURAGEOUS PATRIOTS DID 
NOT SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT AND 
TEARS, SO WE COULD SIT AT HOME 
WHILE OTHERS TRY TO TEAR DOWN 
THEIR LEGACY AND DESTROY OUR 
PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE. 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM AND 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN, 
WE ARE GOING TO WORK, WE ARE 
GOING TO FIGHT, AND WE ARE 
GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN. 
WE WILL NOT BEND. 
WE WILL NOT BREAK. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. 
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER AND WE 
WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO VICTORY.
  
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICAN. 
AND OUR HEARTS BLEED RED WHITE 
AND BLUE. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE. 
ONE FAMILY AND ONE GLORIOUS 
NATION, UNDER GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU, MINNESOTA. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
  
>> ALL RIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
RALLYING SUPPORTERS IN 
ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA. 
A CROWD HAS GATHERED TO LISTEN 
TO THE PRESIDENT. 
HE WAS OSTENSIBLY CAMPAIGNING 
FOR JIM HAGEDORN, BUT OF COURSE 
WE WERE LISTENING TO HEAR WHAT 
IT WAS THE PRESIDENT MIGHT SAY 
REGARDING HIS SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE, BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
YOU WILL RECALL IT WAS JUST A 
COUPLE DAYS AGO THAT IN THE 
COURSE OF TALKING ABOUT HIS 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, THE 
PRESIDENT TURNED HIS ATTENTION 
TO ONE OF KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSERS, 
DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 
ESSENTIALLY MOCKING HER 
TESTIMONY AT THAT SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING 
LAST WEEK. 
BUT TODAY WE DID NOT HEAR 
DOCTOR FORD'S NAME MENTIONED BY 
THE PRESIDENT. 
LET'S GO NOW TO OUR CBS NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT CHIP REID WHO IS 
TRAVELING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND IS AT THAT RALLY. 
CHIP, I KNOW IT IS HARD TO READ,
BUT IT WAS INTERESTING. 
MOMENTS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT 
TOOK THE STAGE, THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL PUBLISHED AN OP-ED 
WRITTEN BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
IN IT, KAVANAUGH DEFENDS HIS 
DEMEANOR DURING HIS TESTIMONY 
LAST THURSDAY. 
I WANT TO READ SOME OF WHAT HE 
WRITES. 
HE SAID, MY TESTIMONY WAS 
FORCEFUL AND PASSIONATE, 
BECAUSE I FORCEFULLY AND 
PASSIONATELY DENY THE 
ALLEGATION AGAINST ME. 
I MIGHT'VE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL 
AT TIMES. 
I KNOW MY TONE WAS SHARP AND I 
SAID A FEW THINGS I SHOULD NOT 
HAVE SAID. 
GOING FORWARD, YOU CAN COUNT ON 
ME TO BE THE SAME KIND OF JUDGE 
AND PERSON I HAVE BEEN FOR MY 
ENTIRE 28 YEAR LEGAL CAREER. 
I AM WONDERING A COUPLE OF 
THINGS. 
THAT WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST 
THERE MAY BE CONCERN ON THE 
PART OF THE JUDGE OR DON 
McGANN, THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL 
HELPING HIM THROUGH THIS 
PROCESS, THAT IN FACT THE ISSUE 
OF TEMPERAMENT MIGHT BE ONE 
GIVING SOME SENATORS PAUSE. 
DO YOU THINK AN OP-ED LIKE THIS 
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO 
THOSE SENATORS WHO MAY BE ON 
THE FENCE? 
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 
I THINK YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL 
ON THE HEAD. 
I THINK WHAT IS GOING ON AS HE 
FELT HE NEEDED AND HIS ADVISORS 
FELT HE NEEDED TO DO A BIT OF 
AMY A CALL BUT, BECAUSE OF HIS 
TONE AT THAT HEARING. 
HE WAS GETTING WIDELY CRITICIZED
FOR IT AND THERE
