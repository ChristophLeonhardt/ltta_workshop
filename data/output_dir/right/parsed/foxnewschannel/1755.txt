FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT MATT FINN
LIFE OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE
WHERE HE WAS THIS AFTERNOON WHEN
THIS NEWS BROKE IN MISSOURI.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT, MATT.
>> HI, MARTHA.
AT THE CENTER OF THIS CASE THE
ALLEGED INVASION OF PRIVACY CASE
IS THAT PHOTO, WHICH THE WOMAN
SAYS GREITENS TOOK OF HER WHILE
SHE WAS TIED TO AN EXERCISE
MACHINE DURING AN EXTRAMARITAL
AFFAIR IN 2015.
THE WOMAN WHO HAS NOT IDENTIFIED
BUT KNOWN TO BE HIS HAIRDRESSER
CLAIMS THE GOVERNOR TOOK THE
PICTURE OF HER AGAINST HER WILL
AND THREATEN TO SEND IT.
HER TESTIMONY AMOUNTED TO ENOUGH
FOR GOVERNOR GREITENS TO BE
CHARGED WITH A FELONY INVASION
OF PRIVACY.
HOWEVER THAT PHOTO NEVER
SURFACED.
WE WERE IN DAY THREE OF THE JURY
SELECTION PROCESS TODAY.
KIND OF SCRATCHING OUR HEADS
WONDERING HOW THIS TRIAL WAS
CONTINUING WITHOUT THE PHOTO AT
THE CENTER OF THE CASE.
AT THIS MORNING ONE OF THE FIRST
THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING
COURT WAS A MEMBER OF GREITENS'
DEFENSE TEAM TOOK TO THE STAND
AND PUT IT ON RECORD THAT
DISCOVERY HAS CLOSED AT HIS
PHOTO HAS NOT SURFACED.
YET THEY CONTINUED WITH THE JURY
SELECTION PROCESS ALL THROUGHOUT
THE DAY.
WE NOW LEARN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S
DEFENSE TEAM DID FILE A MOTION
TO DISMISS, ALTHOUGH THAT MOTION
WAS DENIED, AND THEN EXPECTING
TO GO HOME AND THE LAST HOUR OR
TWO THIS AFTERNOON, THE STATE
TOOK TO THE BENCH AND SAID THAT
IT IS GOING TO DROP THIS CASE.
IT THEN RELEASED A STATEMENT
SAYING IN PART THAT THEY ARE
DROPPING THE CASE BECAUSE THE
JUDGE IN THIS CASE ALLOWED THE
CIRCUIT ATTORNEY WHO IS
PROSECUTING GREITENS TO BE A
WITNESS AND THEY SAY THEY HAVE
NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO DROP THIS
PARTICULAR TRIAL AND SEEK A
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
THERE'S A SPECIAL MEETING THIS
THURSDAY IN WHICH THE
GOVERNOR GREITENS CAN BE
IMPEACHED BY THE STATE
LEGISLATURE AND THERE'S ALSO
ANOTHER CASE BEHIND ALL THIS,
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HERE IS
CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE
WHETHER THE GOVERNOR USED HIS
DONOR LIST FROM HIS PRIVATE
