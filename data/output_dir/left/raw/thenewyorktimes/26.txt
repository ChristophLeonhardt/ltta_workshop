[ticking]

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,920
From CBS, New York, in
color, "Face the Nation," a

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,250
spontaneous and unrehearsed
news interview with

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,960
the Apollo 8 astronauts —

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,110
Colonel Frank Borman, the
command pilot of the mission;

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,530
Captain James Lovell, who has
logged more hours in space

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,910
than any other man; and
Lieutenant Colonel William

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,790
Anders, for whom
the trip to the moon

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,975
was his first
voyage into space.

10
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,900
You three gentlemen
are the first men

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,729
to escape from the
Earth, so to speak.

12
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,520
Is there, I’m sure you’re going
to be asked this over

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,860
and over again, but I think
everybody wonders about it.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,680
Is there some kind of
a psychological wrench,

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,684
when you see the Earth
actually receding,

16
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:48,100
when you’re alone
in the universe,

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,845
and the only spot in the
whole visible universe

18
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:52,720
is an Earth which is so
distant that it looks

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,460
like — as I believe one of
you said — like a quarter,

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,840
or something of that sort?

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Is there some kind of a
feeling which might seriously

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,000
affect people who
are not like you —

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,067
trained, experienced?

24
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,150
In other words, if you had
a passenger aboard, who

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,400
were not so busy, would
he really feel a wrench?

26
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:22,744
[music]

27
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:24,410
Never thought a bit
about what it might

28
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,760
mean to people on Earth.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,920
I only know what it
felt like to me.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,872
[music]

31
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,780
What they should
have sent was poets,

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,530
because I don’t
think we captured,

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,840
in its entirety, the grandeur
of what we had seen.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,370
[music]

35
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,520
We were the first
ones to see it

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,910
in color from that altitude.

37
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,340
Nobody had ever seen
anywhere close to that.

38
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,441
I mean, at best, they’d see
the horizon out like this.

39
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:01,327
[music]

40
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,420
You don’t see cities.

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,710
You don’t see boundaries.

42
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,840
You don’t see countries.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,010
You don’t see people.

44
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,380
It looks like the
place is uninhabited.

45
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,368
[music]

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,260
When we went into orbit and
then injected to the moon,

47
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,300
there was absolutely
no prior thinking

48
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,750
about what the Earth
would look like.

49
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,800
Zero.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,150
And it was only when we were
separated from the booster

51
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,420
and able to turn around and
sort of catch our breath

52
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,350
and float over to the
window that I say,

53
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,700
wow, look at that, to myself.

54
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,870
And neither Frank nor Jim had
ever seen anything like that

55
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,912
either.

56
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:56,450
There isn’t that much
difference between the Earth

57
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,980
and the orbit.

58
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,320
It’s only when you
get into deeper space

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:09,300
that you experience the total
immersion in the heavens.

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,600
The Earth was the only thing
in the entire universe,

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,200
of all this inky black
void, that Earth was there

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,779
with a beautiful
blue hue to it.

63
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,790
The blue marble — that’s
what it looked like,

64
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,070
a blue marble or blue agate.

65
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,980
I had trouble
orienting myself

66
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,350
because I didn’t know
which end was north,

67
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,880
which end was up.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,070
And I worked my way down from
the South Pole, Antarctica,

69
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,800
and was able to identify
continents and whatnot,

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,050
and realized that, well,
O.K., that brown thing

71
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,925
off to the right was
the bulge of Africa.

72
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,850
And then, as things
started popping out,

73
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,730
I could see Florida
and the tongue

74
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,850
of the ocean down at
the Bahamas, very blue.

75
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,484
Well, I thought, oh my
God, this is amazing.

76
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:57,328
[music]

77
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:03,850
This was the first
time that we actually

78
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,700
escaped from the Earth.

79
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,340
And at that time,
I suddenly realized

80
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,880
that everything in
life is relative.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,490
When you’re in a
room, your world

82
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,140
revolves around those walls.

83
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,130
When you’re outside,
then your world

84
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,010
revolves around what
your eye can see.

85
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,950
And suddenly, when
you’re in a spacecraft,

86
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,450
you think in terms of
oceans, of islands.

87
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,402
[music]

88
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,880
There was essentially zero
interest in images of Earth

89
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,000
from space.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,969
Nobody told me to take
a picture of the Earth.

91
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,260
I didn’t think
about it either.

92
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,430
NASA interest was focused on
the mission, and particularly

93
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,910
Borman, was kind of
anti-photography.

94
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,270
It was just one more
thing to divert the crew

95
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,250
to actually completing
the mission, which

96
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,380
was to go around the
moon and get back alive.

97
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,302
[music]

98
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:42,510
We didn’t have any
specific directions

99
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,840
of the use of photography.

100
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,940
We were all on the Earth, so
we all knew about the Earth.

101
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,040
But they wanted photographs
of something that was unusual,

102
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,310
closeups of the far
side of the moon.

103
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,520
And the Earth was
strictly secondary.

104
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,910
We had Hasselblad
70-millimeter cameras,

105
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:14,440
with a magazine that held 200
exposures of thin-based film.

106
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,940
Looking back at the Earth, I’m
thinking, man, that’s pretty.

107
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,560
I wonder what the
right F stop would be.

108
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,896
Well, I always took
three or four.

109
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:25,880
[CAMERA CLICKING AND MUSIC
PLAYING]

110
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,070
We had what today would be
a very rudimentary TV system,

111
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,780
our camera.

112
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:50,430
It didn’t work all
that well at first.

113
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,560
But eventually,
people on the ground

114
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,540
were able to see
something that

115
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,500
resembled an illuminated
sphere called the Earth.

116
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,490
And it wasn’t high
definition by any means.

117
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,930
I was wrong on
things at times,

118
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,480
and I was terribly
wrong on the television.

119
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,140
I didn’t even want to take
a television camera with us.

120
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,120
That was stupid on my part.

121
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,355
The television brought
back the realities

122
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:23,230
of what we were doing
to the American people,

123
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,480
with the people of the world.

124
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,544
[music]

125
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,660
When you’re in the
space between the Earth

126
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,360
and the moon, it’s entirely
different than when you’re

127
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,590
going around the Earth.

128
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,450
Between the Earth
and the moon,

129
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,630
as you look out one window, if
the sun is in that quadrant,

130
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,620
you see sun, and
it’s light as day.

131
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,160
You look out the other
window, and it’s pitch black,

132
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,465
because that window is in
the shadow of the spacecraft.

133
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:27,960
Well, the dark side
was like a night

134
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,480
without a moon on a
high Arizona desert.

135
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,390
The skies are enormously
illuminated by stars, more

136
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,078
stars than you can imagine.

137
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,518
[music]

138
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,640
The moon is
orbiting this way,

139
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,460
and we’re aiming for the
front of the moon, the leading

140
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,302
edge of the moon.

141
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:03,010
The moon is going, as
I recall, something

142
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,230
like 3,000 miles an hour.

143
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,390
And when we get
behind the moon,

144
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,400
we fire the rocket
to slow us up,

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,710
so we will be captured
by the lunar gravity.

146
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,410
If we hadn’t
fired that rocket,

147
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,540
we would have just gone
back and slingshotted back

148
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,040
to the Earth.

149
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,515
Apollo 8, Houston,
one minute to LOF.

150
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:24,110
All systems go.

151
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,090
As we came into the shadow
of the moon, suddenly

152
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,207
it was infinitely black.

153
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,290
And I looked out, and there
were stars everywhere.

154
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,140
And then as I looked
out my side window,

155
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,420
suddenly the stars
stopped, and there

156
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,970
was this black hole.

157
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,545
And the hairs went up
on the back of my neck.

158
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:48,170
And then I realized
that that was the moon,

159
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,650
blocking out the stars.

160
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,100
It was really black.

161
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,890
And that brought up a
animalistic feeling.

162
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:03,730
Well, we were looking
at a portion of the moon

163
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,700
that human eyes had
never seen before.

164
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,250
The moon might have been
what the Earth looked

165
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,510
like before life, like we
were back at the beginning.

166
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,160
I can remember
feeling that way.

167
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,800
It was a poignant moment.

168
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:30,070
Space is black, black,
ink black, velvet black.

169
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,880
There is no color to
space, just as there

170
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,120
is no color to the moon.

171
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,390
The moon is all
shades of gray.

172
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,270
[music]

173
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,630
My job was to make sure
the spacecraft kept running.

174
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,030
And oh, by the way,
if I had any time,

175
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,130
I was the
photographer, as well.

176
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,720
I was the guy stuck
with the camera.

177
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,270
It was a tangential job.

178
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,900
And once I could show that the
spacecraft was working well,

179
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,230
my job was to take
pictures of those craters.

180
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,020
It wasn’t a Ansel
Adams, propose it just

181
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,820
right, shades of gray.

182
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,370
It was take the goddamn crater
and move on to the next one.

183
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,380
I started out setting
up the cameras

184
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,760
and taking pictures according
to my photographic flight

185
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,300
plan.

186
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,380
No matter how
closely you looked,

187
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,680
it was crater upon crater.

188
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,850
It was interesting, but after
about an hour, I’m thinking,

189
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,505
you know, it’s
kind of boring.

190
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:26,475
[music]

191
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,520
We had been spending
all these revolutions

192
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,080
looking at the moon.

193
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,630
Then as we come around
this, an uninviting place,

194
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,340
we look up, and
there’s the Earth.

195
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,020
It’s 240,000 miles away.

196
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,800
It was small enough, you could
cover it with your thumbnail.

197
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,840
And everything we held dear —

198
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,480
our families, our country — 
everything I held dear

199
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,700
was back on that blue planet.

200
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,400
That was a sense of, ah,
how in the world could

201
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,415
this little ball exist in this
vast universe of nothing?

202
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:12,050
The fact that
the lunar horizon

203
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,460
was so ugly and
stark, that amplified

204
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
the beauty of the Earth.

205
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,270
We were all awestruck
by the difference,

206
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,760
the beauty of the
Earth and its color

207
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,635
against the
blackness of space.

208
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:44,180
[music]

209
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,490
We had never had
any discussion

210
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,910
of taking an Earthrise
picture before the flight

211
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,200
or during the flight.

212
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,384
And yet, when we came over
the moon on this flight,

213
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:02,550
we looked up, and there was
this beautiful blue ball

214
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,050
in the background.

215
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,550
It awestruck us immediately.

216
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,767
Get that picture.

217
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,100
This is the best picture we’ve
got of the whole flight.

218
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,530
It gave a contrast.

219
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,950
It said that, hey,
here are people looking

220
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,790
from a different
planet, looking back

221
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,026
at what is our home.

222
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,002
[music]

223
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,810
When I looked at
the Earth on the way

224
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,858
back and had time to be a
little more contemplative,

225
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,050
underscored and got
me thinking, really

226
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,880
for the first time,
we’re just a small piece

227
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,310
of a almost infinite universe.

228
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,110
Before the flight,
I was a Catholic

229
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,830
and had communion from
my old parish priest.

230
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,370
But I must say that my faith
was somewhat undercut as I

231
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,890
looked back at the
tiny Earth, and I

232
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,890
imagined that if the Earth
was the size of a golf

233
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,640
ball at one lunar distances,
at 10 lunar distance,

234
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,760
it was down to a B.B.

235
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,570
And a hundred lunar
distances, where

236
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,790
it’s hardly going
anywhere in space,

237
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,896
it’s like a grain of sand.

238
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,270
I got to thinking,
is that really

239
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,436
the center of the universe?

240
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:09,360
[music]

241
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,530
Well, I was around the
moon, and I saw the Earth.

242
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,760
I realized suddenly how
insignificant we all

243
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,920
are, just tucked away in space
around a rather normal star,

244
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,660
the sun, probably
just one of billions

245
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,240
of stars in the universe.

246
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,210
I personally thought
that everybody

247
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,290
would like to have that
view as we did, to see

248
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,330
the Earth as it really is.

249
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,240
I believe all three of us
had an emotional reaction

250
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,090
to seeing the Earth.

251
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,000
The dearest things in life
were back on the Earth —

252
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,230
my family, my wife.

253
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:30,114
[music]

254
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:58,540
The target for the re-entry
was something like a mail

255
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,150
slot, if the mailman had
delivered your letter

256
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,255
from 20,000 miles away.

257
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:07,080
If we were too steep,
we would burn up.

258
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,790
And if we were
too shallow, we’d

259
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,240
skip out, like skipping
a stone on water.

260
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,780
It always reminded me of
flying inside of a neon tube.

261
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,207
It was so bright.

262
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,540
And every once
in a while, you’d

263
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,698
see chunks of the heat
shield go flying by.

264
00:20:22,698 --> 00:20:25,686
[music]

265
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,812
[music]

266
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,258
[splash]

267
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:16,190
[helicopter engine]

268
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,920
I really don’t
know what I can

269
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,360
say in a situation like this.

270
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,575
We’re very grateful
for your participation.

271
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:35,560
You stayed out here
over Christmas.

272
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,750
A lot of attention gets
focused on the flight crew,

273
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,080
but there’s a great
vast reservoir

274
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,570
of people that support us, and
I guess we all did this.

275
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,500
And we appreciate
your help very much.

276
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,652
Thank you.

277
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:50,705
[cheering]

278
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:53,080
Everything that I held
dear was on this Earth.

279
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,000
And I got off the airplane,
and there it was —

280
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,850
my family and my co-workers
clapping and cheering.

281
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:03,786
That was a very, very — 
that was probably

282
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:05,660
the most emotional part
of the flight for me,

283
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,497
is the homecoming.

284
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:14,250
People were going nuts.

285
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,505
But just getting home was
a rewarding experience.

286
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,070
There was a sense
of accomplishment,

287
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,570
a sense of euphoria
that we actually did it,

288
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,500
and it’s completed.

289
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,955
And just think — 
we were there.

290
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:31,810
And now we’re back again.

291
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,860
We always somehow
could not help knowing

292
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,290
the enormity of what we did.

293
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,330
I knew that, with NASA,
that everybody was elated.

294
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,820
And I was, too.

295
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,290
But the accolades that
suddenly came to us,

296
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,810
it was much greater than,
at least, I expected.

297
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,708
[music]

298
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,910
Now, the question that
we always receive —

299
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,700
what was the most
indelible view?

300
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,680
What do you bring back?

301
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,450
What do you remember
after this flight?

302
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,720
And I must confess
that all of us,

303
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,010
when we saw the Earth rising
over the lunar landscape,

304
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,790
that this was it.

305
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:30,000
The picture that Bill took
of the Earth from Apollo 8

306
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,010
became sort of the trademark
of the mission.

307
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,640
Everywhere we went, we
presented that photograph,

308
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,570
all over Western Europe,
all over the Soviet Union.

309
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,885
It was sort of widely admired.

310
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:44,010
I think people could identify
with it, because they

311
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,093
were on that blue marble.

312
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:53,940
Photograph itself was the
thing that everybody liked.

313
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,780
I mean, it
represented Apollo 8.

314
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,350
And it could be
almost like saying

315
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,570
it was the fourth astronaut,
because it was there,

316
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,565
and it did the job.

317
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:07,995
One frame had showed
exactly our existence.

318
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:11,310
So the one
overwhelming emotion

319
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,590
that we carried
with us is the fact

320
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,060
that we really do all
exist on one small globe.

321
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,850
And when you get
out 240,000 miles,

322
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,565
it really isn’t a
very large Earth.

323
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:26,910
When people had time
to contemplate all that

324
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,620
and let it sink
in, that’s what

325
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,760
really made the
Earthrise picture

326
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,840
one that was considered
such a valuable picture

327
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,650
for the 20th century.

328
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,760
I don’t take much
philosophical,

329
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,617
artistic credit for that.

330
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,450
I just happened to be
there, had the camera,

331
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,300
and wanted the color film,
and took the picture.

332
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,740
Being unlikely poets, or
not being poets at all,

333
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,900
we have to turn to a
very distinguished poet.

334
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,530
And if I may, I’d
like to read to you

335
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,900
an excerpt from Archibald
MacLeish, because I

336
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,840
think it captures the
feelings that we all

337
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,480
had in lunar orbit.

338
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,270
“To see the Earth
as it truly is,

339
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,200
small and blue and beautiful,
and that eternal silence

340
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,140
where it floats, is to
see ourselves as riders

341
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,890
on the Earth together,
brothers on that bright

342
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,070
loveliness in the
eternal cold,

343
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:36,925
brothers who know now that
they are truly brothers.”

344
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:39,050
Gentlemen, since you’ve
now established yourselves,

345
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,390
by your own admission,
as philosophers,

346
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,049
I’d like to ask you a kind
of a philosophical question.

347
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,840
Do you think it’s
changed something in you?

348
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,215
I notice, for
example, you always

349
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:48,655
refer now to the good Earth.

350
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:50,030
You’re hardly
able to say Earth

351
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,990
without saying ‘good
Earth,’ as though you

352
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,689
had gotten some new
affection for this ball.

353
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:56,480
I don’t think it’s
changed anything in me,

354
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,810
but it certainly has amplified
a feeling, a basic feeling,

355
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,720
that I’ve had for many
years about the Earth.

356
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,210
I think it first started when
Jim and I flew on Gemini,

357
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,610
and you realize that these
boundaries we have are really

358
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,270
artificial ones.

359
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,380
Well, you mentioned
about the Earth receding.

360
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,150
And that feeling of
mine, that perhaps,

361
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,790
we wouldn’t get back there —

362
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,290
which, of course,
would be natural —

363
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,880
if you could only
transform that

364
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,760
into everybody on the
Earth, that they really

365
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,830
don’t understand
and realize what

366
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,615
you have here until
you leave it.

367
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:31,040
I may be naïve, but I think
that we will eventually,

368
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,050
through the space program
and through the space

369
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,570
exploration, away
from the Earth

370
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,240
and away from the totally
nationalistic interest,

371
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,380
we may, in some way, develop
a closer relationship here

372
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,210
among the people.

373
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,525
I firmly believe that.

374
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:50,495
[music]

375
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,670
I don’t think the
Apollo program, as yet,

376
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:08,120
brought as worldly a
view, interlocking view,

377
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,230
to humankind
that I had hoped.

378
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,870
And even today, when
I hear people chanting

379
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,890
that we ought to go on to
Mars, I’m thinking, well,

380
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,560
why don’t we get our act
together here on Earth first,

381
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,690
and go to Mars
as human beings,

382
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,340
not as jingoistic Americans
or Chinese or Russians

383
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,000
or Indians.

384
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,965
Let’s just do it
as human beings.

385
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,850
It makes me feel a
little bit disappointed.

386
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,180
We did something
that ended up showing

387
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:48,450
the Earth and its people
exactly how we existed, where

388
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,290
we are, that we were really,
here on Earth, a spacecraft,

389
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,810
and we were all astronauts.

390
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:59,010
And whether we
liked it or not,

391
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,500
like we were in
spacecraft, having

392
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,430
to work closely together
to accomplish the mission.

393
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,150
Down here, we seem to
not be able to do that.

394
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,330
It was a very,
very sobering look

395
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,210
to see this beautiful, little
blue marble in the middle

396
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,930
of all that darkness.

397
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,110
And you realized
how lonely we really

398
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,610
are on this wonderful Earth.

399
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,620
And I think it gave
a lot of people

400
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,280
hope and transcended
national boundaries.

401
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,400
Of course, things got
back to normal rapidly.

402
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,160
But at least for an
instant in history,

403
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,310
I believe that people
looked upon themselves

404
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,890
as citizens of the Earth.

405
00:28:45,890 --> 00:00:00,000
