the Trump economy continues to boom with employment so high Trump is going to have to build the wall just so he can tear it down to letting more workers black and Hispanic unemployment or at record lows in the gap between the white and black economy is narrowing in important ways and so of course Democrats are angry after a June jobs report highlighting over 200,000 new jobs DNC chair Tom socialism is our future Perez issued a statement saying Donald Trump's policies were quote reckless unquote Perez says if Trump continues to recklessly provide jobs for Americans it will actually increase unemployment especially among Democrat politicians Nancy Pelosi says high unemployment is bad for America because when people have jobs they stop collecting unemployment benefits which according to Nancy Pelosi are one of the best ways to create jobs now let me say about unemployment insurance we talk about it as a safety net and the rest this is one of the biggest stimulus to our economy the contest will tell you this money is spent quickly as it injects demand into the economy and it's job-creating it creates jobs faster than almost any other initiative you can name because again it is money that is needed for families to survive and it is spent so it has a double benefit it helps those who've lost their jobs but it also is a job creator so according to Nancy Pelosi if people have jobs they won't collect unemployment so they won't have jobs because they have jobs below she also asked reporters why she was wearing her blouse inside out and how all that lipstick had gotten on her forehead Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the great jobs report had caused the Statue of Liberty to start crying because low unemployment proved illegal immigrants were no longer being allowed to break into the country and take jobs from Americans Schumer later conceded that the Statue of Liberty might also just be crying because she had gone off her meds in fact Schumer said that might be why he was crying to trigger warning Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right we're back but clay Ville is weakened ISM I had a great weekend I went whale

you do one of the things that people delude themselves with is they say yeah you know I eat it on my wife but I'm not an adulterer you know yeah you know I'm violent and angry all the time but I'm not really an angry guy I'm really a good guy and not so if you're doing it that's who you are and the thing is you have got to take if you are doing stuff and you're blaming Donald Trump or even if you're blaming Barack Obama cuz Barack Obama was present for eight years I just the guy I thought he was corrupt incompetent I never attacked anybody physically or on the street or harassed anybody of course I didn't because you are what you do and I don't want to be that guy you know there are two TV shows recently one called bloodlines and another one called that I really like called search party I actually like both of them but both of them felt were filled with people doing terrible things who kept saying well we're not bad people I mean in fact the blood line promo was we're not bad people but we did a bad thing if you're doing bad things you are a bad person take a look here is a member here are members of Alexandria occasio Cortes you know the girl just got it was going to be the congresswoman candidate for the Dems in Queens she's a socialist here are members of her party harassing Mitch McConnell as he comes out of a restaurant in Kentucky so you know we know where you live he's a 76 year old man right is a 76 year old man who has been duly elected by his country which is a democratic free democratic republic to be senator he's been in there who knows I can't even remember how long but he is now the Senate Majority Leader so a respected member of a duly duly elected member of our law legislature and they're surrounding this 76 year old man shouting at him we know where you live if you are doing that you are a thug it's not Trump's fault you're a thug it's not Mitch's fault you're a thug you are a thug the mayor of Durbin North Carolina is trying to shut down a Jordan Peterson speech because he disagrees with Jordan Peterson and he calls them all these names like the left does all those names like racist and homophobic and transfer they just mean I disagree with you so he disagrees so he's going to shut them down well if Jordan Peterson disagrees with the mayor of Durban does he shut him down no why because the Durban is a thug the mayor of Durban is acting like a fascist if you are chasing people Steve Bannon got chased out of a bookstore the founder of the walk away movement this guy Brendon Straka was in New York he was at a camera store and they wouldn't serve him you know it's not on Trump it's not Trump's fault if you suck you know if you gang up on women in movie theaters you're a bully it's not on Trump you are a bully if you harass duly elected public officials and restaurants you were a thug if you oppose free speech like the New York Times does for anyone who disagrees with you if you shout people down at colleges if you attack them it's not Trump who's the fascist it's you you are what you do you know I mean I think it's it's time it really is - and why why how did you become like this you think you're a good person how did you become a bad person well it's got to be got to be your ideas it's got to be your philosophy you know socialism socialism is not wrong because it doesn't work it doesn't work but it's also wrong it is wrong just like slavery is wrong it's wrong for exactly the same reasons you know it's slavery in movies about slavery they always try to tell you how bad slavery is by showing people get whipped and brutalized but slavery wasn't bad because people got whipped and brutalized slavery people got whipped and brutalized because slavery was bad that's why that happened because when you want to control people when you want to take people's freedoms away when you want them to become instruments of your will you have to abuse them and enslave them so what does it mean when you talk about slavery why slavery wrong slavery is wrong because people should be free that is self-evident we hold that as a self-evident truth that people should be free what does it mean for people to be free it means you cannot use superior force to force them to do what you want them to do now obviously there are some limits on people's behavior you can't murder somebody you can't physically attack somebody but we want to keep those as small as possible those limitations as small as possible the fact that some are needed is not an excuse to have people to control people's behavior altogether slavery is wrong because it is wrong for people with superior power to tell people with less power to use that power to force people to do what they want why does that include property you know sometimes people don't know about this it includes property because your life is made of time your life that's all you have in life is time when your time is up your life is over that's it so when you use your life when you are free you choose to use your time the way you want if I build a statue in my house and I sculpt it you can't come into my house and take that statue away it's mine it's part of my life as part of my freedom if I use my time to make money you can't come and take that money away even if you are oh so smart and oh so good and your experts are oh so brilliant that they know how to spend my money better than I know how to spend my money it is still slavery it is still wrong and when you enslave people you have to brutalize them because they do not like it they don't like it well how do you do that how do you get people to give up their freedom I'll talk about that in just a second but first I've got to talk about helix leap nobody knows more about helix leap than me because I never go to sleep so I get to use their pillow all night long and feel how comfortable it is other people see other people are trying to sell you their mattresses are brilliant they're make their mattresses just for you but other people don't know this right because they're asleep on the mattresses I'm awake all night so I know how comfortable this stuff is helix sleep has developed a mattress that's customized to your specific height weight and sleep preferences so you can have the best sleep of your life at an unbeatable price here's how it works you go to helix sleep calm fill out their two minutes sleep quiz and they'll design your custom mattress they can even customize each side of it for you and your partner the all-new pillows I have one they're fully adjustable you can achieve perfect comfort regardless of sleep position or body type they really are great and I know because I'm awake all night line on them thinking how comfortable they are go to helix sleep dot-com slash clayvin right now and you'll get up to a hundred and twenty five dollars towards your mattress order that's helix sleep comm slash clayvin for up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off your mattress order helix sleep calm slash Clavin I know what you're thinking no I don't but maybe you're thinking how do you spell Clavin it's que la vie aan so when you want to take people's freedom away you've got to scare them you've got to change the rules of the game right so it's not you can't say to somebody oh you're wrong I disagree with you you have to say oh you're racist you're a terrible person so you try tonight is going to pick a new justice of the Supreme Court right and it will probably if he does it right if he gets it well if he does it the way he's supposed to it will move the court slightly to the right not a lot to the right because Anthony Kennedy was really a right wing judge and by right wing by the way we want something different on the right than the left once the left wants the results they want they want abortion they want gay rights we want them to follow the law as it is written and if the law needs to be changed we want to change the law that's called being a free country they want to manipulate the law and declare the law to be what it what they want it to be so it's very different we're fighting over two very different things it's not that the right wants decisions on the right and the left wants decisions on the left the left wants decisions on the left and the right wants decisions according to the law very very different things so probably if we're lucky if Trump does a good job the court will move slightly to the right but and John Roberts will become the swing vote rather than Anthony Kennedy which is not going to be that that big a change but they are going nuts here's a montage from our friends at gray bein of the reporting on this just trying to get people scared because they want your freedom they want to take your freedom away this is cut number three we're looking at a destruction of the Constitution of the United States as far as I can tell this is a line that's been drawn about whether we are going to criminalize women this nomination it moves the court really dangerous direction it's a very thin line between putting a woman in prison for a stillbirth or a miscarriage that she's blamed for for something she did during her pregnancy and criminalizing abortion what's at stake are their constitutional rights to protection against the abuses of power by the president by Congress by by corporate America a justice that would reverse Roe what happens in essence we go to 50 civil wars in each of the states plus the District of Columbia for instance federal survivor benefits from Social Security federal worker pensions could be lost they also want to criminalize abortion in this country they are literally trying to punish women for justiça women's women should be noted as the aunt Lydia of the Supreme Court and I legacy that this president is creating really is trained back the clock a hundred years that was a lot going by I don't know if you heard that one woman essentially saying if you're pregnant you take a drink and you have a miscarriage Republicans are gonna put you in jail that's basically just so you know that's what we're all thinking so campus reform I love these guys they they do a great job we had them on once before we should have a back campus reform goes out in interviews students about things so this time they go out and this looks like NYU it is NYU they're there they ask students to discuss Trump's Supreme Court pick which hasn't been made yet right so there is no Supreme Court yet so they asked them how they like the Supreme Court pick that doesn't exist what's the reaction to the justice that he nominated a I'm honestly not surprised by his choice but that's just worse for us I just saw the pic and I was like like it's almost at a point where you kind of expect that some it's not gonna be what you want he's quite you know extreme in his views I don't know who would make the Supreme Court very even I see it all over the news that like he's he's like this new like nominee is very recent I think is starting a new wave of something something very negative and I'm really scared about what happen in the future and watch choices he'll make so what reaction have you seen on social media today after the news Oh outrage should be if this is just a reoccurring thing he keeps doing this with different positions and just doing every Watts using his power do so do you feel like his pic is an abuse of power basically yeah it's entire cabinet and everyone he's chosen has been the white supremacist Legion of Doom and it's dangerous everyone who looks like me it's like so the media goes out and terrorizes these kids who are not reading and enough information to know what what the hell is going on and then they think that they are under attack and they think that the you know this this guy thinks is you know that the cabinet is filled with white supremacists and the court has now appointed a white supremacist you know and that turns people violent and they become the instruments the useful idiots of this Creed and this Creed is socialism and socialism is slavery if you don't you know if you don't believe this the guy who really has started this movement re re legitimized socialism in America Bernie Sanders you know go back and look at some of the old clips of him talking about Castro I mean let's let us not make any mistake about Fidel Castro this this man who Barbara Walters flirted with who other American journalists actually slept with who they actually praised Fidel Castro the Castro regime x' total death toll according to the Cuba archive this is this is people dead from torture prison beatings firing squads machine gunning drownings and so on a hundred thousand people a hundred thousand people in a population of 6.4 million with five hundred thousand Cubans being put in prison and forced labor camps which means that in according to their population this is worse than Stalin I mean the percentage is worse than Stalin one of the great tyrants of all of human history I mean they used you know Fidel Castro and used to take pictures of them murdering people and send them around just like the ISIS just like Isis does today let us go back in time just a little bit there's 1985 right so it's 25 years after Castro is in power he's doing all this stuff he's been doing it here is Bernie Sanders talking about a cut number eight way back in 1961 they invaded Cuba and everybody was totally convinced the Castro was the worst guy in the world all the Cuban people were gonna rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro did forgot that he educated the kids gave them health care totally transformed the society you know not to say that Fidel Castro of Cuba are perfect they are certainly not but just because Ronald Reagan dislikes these people does not mean to say that the people in their own nations feel the same way so they expected as tremendous uprising in Cuba it never came you know it's funny he sounds just like every communist I've ever heard these young kind they have they have the whole is talking they're talking really fast you can't really tell you're starting to say wait wait wait wait could we go back to the people the hundred thousand people being tortured to death the five hundred thousand half a million people out of a population of six million half a million being put in forced labor camps what what is there is there's nothing that so you can say well that's 1985 dude that's like mad now I'm doing the math it's like dude thirty years ago right it's thirty years ago listen to him today say he's still making excuses for a lot of positive things that can be said their health care system for a third world country is is quite good it's universal old people have health care without any expense last time I was there I visited a hospital where they do very very serious and good work they come up with a lot of new trucks Doc's names you brightleaf their educational system is strong but in truth their economy is in pretty bad shape and in truth you don't do very well if you descent in Cuba so I think you know if you look although Castro's long life he overthrew a terrible dictator supported by the United States of America Batista some very positive changes came about we could argue to the cows come home to what degree American interference you know created the kind of society that existed in Cuba today I could do a whole show just talking about those that thirty Seconds I mean everything about it is insane and the the hospital they show him a Potemkin hospital the health care in Cuba is crap they show them a Potemkin Hospital and he thinks it's wonderful yeah you don't do too well if you dissent but you get free health care which is great so they come and crack you over the head for disagreeing with Castro but you get your health care is free when they take you to carry you off to the hospital and then they show you you know so it's like it's great it's a great system and then blaming America the fact that there was a bad dictator there whom we supported to keep monsters like Castro out of power that was always why we were supporting these guys was to keep communism from spreading because it's slavery it is inherently slavery and like slavery it is inherently violent and I just want to play one more clip of Bernie and I don't mean to go after him particularly except he is the voice of the Democratic Party and he is the voice of all these students that you here who are socialists who know just as much as the students you just heard talking about a Skoda spic that doesn't exist right Bernie is their spirit animal so I'm just just showing you who the guy is he's talking about bread lines we've here in America when we would look at the Soviet Union here in America where the biggest problem the poor has is obesity right but our poor people are obese in America I mean I'm not bracing poverty I'm just saying that if you live in a country where poor people or their problem is they're obese you're doing better than other kind of hearing is talking about bread lines in communist countries back in 85 20 sometimes American journalists talk about how bad the country is people are lining up it's a good thing when people are lining up for food when they have food shortages they have food shortages because of forced you know they because they took over the farming industries because they take over the industries and the industries collapse when there's no competition industries collapse when there's state-run industries collapse when they're run from the top down that's why they have the shortages they don't need to have shortages they don't have shortages here we we don't have food shortages here and people do not lie and have bread lines like I said the poor in our country are obese because they have plenty of food we don't have that problem it's it's it's unbelievable the things you know philosophy it really people do not pay enough respect to the power of ideas ideas can make you evil they can make you good they can make you better they can make your country better they can make your country worse ideas matter they matter so much you are what you do but what you do comes out of what you believe what you do is produce by what you believe I mean this is when Jesus would say don't worry about what you take into your mouth where you about what comes out of your mouth because that comes out of your heart your actions come out of your heart when you are surrounding an old man on the street an elected official on the street and screaming Adam or a woman that comes out of your heart your heart has been poisoned by your ideas you know I was watching I saw this clip from this woman Michelle wolf who is the comedienne who I guess she started out on The Daily Show and like Samantha bee she's just not that funny I mean she's you know occasionally she says something funny she has his shoulder break and she does a thing celebrating abortion we're not gonna we're not going to say safe but rare we want to celebrate abortion here she is it should be the it shouldn't be the new I summer in Montauk it should be on the dollar menu at McDonald's ayat code and can you get this egg out of my McMuffin so tonight in honor of America I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the breaks tenth annual salute to abortion that's like six movie tickets movie a bad deal and women don't forget you have the power to give wave and then we'll try to control that so this is the the problem with the philosophy is of course then unborn babies are children unborn babies are people now you can make there are arguments you can make for abortion I don't think they hold up but you can make abortion but if you're celebrating an abortion something has happened something wrong has happened to you your philosophy has polluted your heart and ultimately you are going to become a bad person you're gonna be sitting there going we're good people while you're burying the body of the innocent you know I mean that is that is what ideas do to you this is this is degraded stuff it really is I mean let alone that it's not funny but it might have been funny she might had better writers it might have been a funny routines praising an abortion it still would have been degraded twisted ugly stuff your ideas you've got to care about your ideas and one of the ways you know that your ideas have degraded you is when you find yourself doing something terrible like harassing a woman on the street or harassing a man on the street shouting - people shutting them up shutting them down attacking people for speaking when you find yourself doing those things it's time to say oh I'm not a good person anymore I am what I do and I'm doing bad stuff and it must be because of my ideas you know this guy we were talking about who couldn't get served in a camera store as the walk away movement walk away when you find yourself doing stuff like that bullying people harassing people taking away their freedom walk away from your ideas he got to change him up hey Michael Knowles who you may have heard of although why you would have heard of him I don't know buddy you may have heard of him he was going to be with us in a moment he's going to we're going to continue this discussion especially when it comes to God and the Democrats a really interesting discussion but we have to break away from Facebook and YouTube to say cast you out into

tumblr in order the leftist tears don't stain your desk all right wake up Michael moles coming up NOLs hey drew I was watching that clip on the show before it came on if that woman gets a Netflix show what am I doing wrong that quote that gets you your own Netflix show yeah I think what you're doing wrong is not that you're not celebrating abortion I think that's also the voice I know you know I'm sorry but like the word shrill like should have her next we should use that for the next season of another Kingdom for the mouse me yeah speaking of which that was een there was a hell of a trip on that whaling boat that was incredible it was I you know I'd really like to portray it for everyone listening as though we were out you know with a happening them yet it was wonderful that we got I didn't realize you can just see blue whales up that close you know like I said I lived in Santa Barbara for 15 years I never did that I did I did go out once out to the islands to kayak and I saw these these absolute field of dolphins I mean it's unbelievable you just see thousands of dolphins but we saw so much stuff and I gotta say we now know what what Jeremy's talent is that is truth is unbelievable the guy's zeroed in like miles away sand I've read dead ahead yeah and I really have to thank him too it is so much easier to write my show with that warm light of the blood and in the layoffs it's so much better than Florence right now I know they do make great lanterns those we'll all right so we've been talking about ideas and you know Trump is gonna pick the Supreme Court if he picks Amy Barrett who I really like and she's a Catholic they have been going after her for her Catholicism which I find repulsive in the extreme but it is part of their philosophy is it not this is amazing it began it really rose to everyone's attention in 2012 when the Democrats booed God at their National Convention yes they say they didn't do that did they they did do that I want to see it I have the clip I do you need to say yes Joey let's let's see the clip the platform to address the criticism and watch what happen is there any further discussion hearing none the matter requires a two-thirds vote in the affirmative all those delegates in favor say aye all those delegates opposed say no in the opinion of the let me do that again all of those delegates in favor say aye all those delegates opposed say no all those delegates opposed say no in the opinion of the chair 2/3 of voted in the affirmative the motion is adopted and the platform has been and it is shown on the screen so that's that says they're putting God back into the platform they said we're gonna put God back in because God was in in 2008 they took it out because Democrats hate God yeah the Democratic Party hates God and then they realized this was probably not a good look doesn't play in Peoria so they decided to put it back in and you hear so they shout no no give us Barabbas something like I couldn't hear the exactly and then at the very end he just pretends he's even being kind of honest in his facial expressions he says yeah I know it sounds like 2/3 okay it's back in and they boo they deliver they said you you know yes so this is we've seen it since then it actually goes back much further than this it goes back to 2006 and this was when how under the leadership of Howard Dean Democrats doubled down on their base among secular young yuppie latte-sipping liberal is the kind of stereotype with clearly a socialist materialist bent I mean that's clearly where they're going that was the essence and they and they double down and it did help them in 2006 but this doesn't spell great news for them electorally because they're according to a recent poll from pew 55% of democrats don't believe in a God that we would recognize as God some of them say I'm an atheist but I believe in the chakras you know man shit but the 55% don't believe in a God that resembles the God of the Bible among white Democrats that number rises to 68 percent holy moly and this creates a big issue for them because among black and Hispanic Democrats the that it's totally flipped the majority of them believe in a biblical God and so you're seeing much greater similarities on questions of religious belief with Republicans black and Hispanic Democrats and Republicans and you're seeing certain cracks in the Democrat electoral coalition I think that a lot of that is due to this base issue of God you see that the Amy Barrett of floating nomination has really drawn this point home I don't know if you saw today in The Daily Beast there was a big expose on Leonard Leo who is the head of the the Federalist Society they've put all those great originalist judges up and it was called the secrets of leonard leo by Michael J Jay Michaelson and do you know what the secret is he's a Catholic oh my you're joke that's the secret and it really is I'm really dead serious and by the way I don't know which is more hilarious in this article the outright errors like just factual errors about Christianity and Catholicism or the insinuations that no basic elements of philosophy and theology or crazy and bizarre but this is how I mean you've got to remember that the press is a wing of the Democrat Party right this is like in the 1960s they did this to Kennedy you know this anti-catholicism this is what you're getting he writes Leonard's faith is paramount to him Carter said when he traveled staff members had to find him a church near where he was staying so he could go to Mass every day why'd you go to Mass this is terrible it's just a mass every day every day can you imagine that next next you'll find out he was praying every day that must be stopped yeah to be sure to be sure none of this is to repeat the odious claims of anti-catholicism and dual loyalty by sea an American there's no but after that sentence there you can't grammatically use but after that and this is it he says but leo has spent a career shaping the federal judiciary to reflect rigid conservative religious dogmas and there's that dogma word again you remember Dianne Feinstein said this at a me koni Barrett's confirmation last year she said ain't Amy Barrett you what you go to church or something the dogma lives allowed within you the dogma and it's just what they don't understand what religion means to people because that it's a very glib in shallow philosophy it's the kind of philosophy that boos God the in that same piece is a really great example this daily beast B's they say it they talk about how he believes that the notions that human life begins at conception that homosexuality is immoral that the moral natural law is part of the fabric of the universe that men and women are complementary to one another he's saying these things as though an alien from outer space came down and started uttering them a crazy person you know it is because I really believe this because socialism is essentially slavery because socialism is slavery you have to remove the underpinning of the individuals dignity and holiness and sacredness you have to get rid of God because you can't enslave people if God is there you know I mean every every step in the way to abolishing slavery came through Christianity because it dignifies the human being it's it's unbelievable and this that prose this thing you're reading is unbelievable to me and there are so many other examples this is the best one that came out like five minutes ago but just google it you'll find a million it's big as you say leftism is a jealous god I mean after the fall of the Berlin Wall all these leftist ideologies basically came to replace communism and to be the counter to a religious faith but you know people are starting to get it in Silicon Valley there is a great line it said you can be openly polyamorous and people will call you brave you can put micro doses of LSD in your cereal people will call you a pioneer but the one thing you cannot be as a Christian in the Atlantic is responding to this they say Democrats must regain the trust of religious voters what they're doing though is it's I think it's mostly the glibness and the dismissal that is there they're both dismissing religion and they're drawing this great fear of it so you had this guy on CNN what's his name Dean Obeidallah he compared Christianity to Sharia law oh no you're kidding he did he said they're there Christians are trying to push their own Christian Sharia law into the country Washington Post Catherine rampell said religious law may be coming to America but it's not Sharia it's Christian and there's something very ironic about this which is they're trying to scare you about Christianity by saying it's just like Islam well the same time Islam's great it's peaceful they should be thrilled it's the religion of BZ and this you know since then since 2006 you've seen there was an article in The New Yorker the creepy chick-fil-a infiltration of New York City oh yeah this is all about God it's because the the owner of chick-fil-a has the audacity to worship God and now they're against chicken sandwich shops the this there are a few Democrats who realize the peril of staking your political party again to God what chris coons said this the Delaware senator he said we can't just become a secular party we can't just push secular values that won't resonate with people New York Times admitted it Matt John Asaf race the Democrats have this religion problem also I've sort of wrote off religion Barack Obama wrote off religious people as bitter clingers yeah during their his presidential campaign in the this gets down to Jerusalem but in that same convention where they removed God from the platform they also removed references to Jerusalem as Israel's capital yeah this goes down very very deep and it was a it was a short term strategy in 2006 but I think it does spell peril for for the Democrat Party they can't maintain their coalition over time the the coalition of the ascendant as they said doubling down on divisions among ethnic racial groups yeah they can't double down on that forever if they oppose them on essential questions you know it's really interesting I'm watching this show called the sinner on Netflix just a kind of mystery show from USA and with Jessica Biel it's it's it's fun it's not but the whole thing and it is in her youth her mother is this crazed Catholic who blames her for everything that goes wrong because she's sinning and all this and I thought like this is so old this is so old I've seen a million times what if what if it has been a socialist I mean that right that would have been so much more real so much more modern and and new I mean ultimately this narrative breaks down I think their real problem though I really do think their problem is that with God it's very very hard to kill them babies it's yeah it's tough to get to the baby killing place you know you might get away with it you might get away with well it should be rare because if you don't do it legally it's gonna be the it's gonna be a back-alley abortion you might get away with that argument but dressing up in the red white and blue and doing a march and celebrating baby baby killing you're not gonna get to that place with God you just can't do it and so they're really in a bind I almost considered playing that clip of Michelle in this segment because it wasn't so long ago that the Democrat Party treated abortionists want meeting to be safe legal and rare right it was the Hillary Clinton campaign line the first time and that has become a sacramental view of abortion they've elevated this thing into a sacrament and I think it's in part because it doesn't say we're never made any sense if it's not if it's morally similar to murder it shouldn't be legal if it's morally pointless or morally without value then it doesn't need to be rare right that right it doesn't quite add up yeah and ideas ultimately become logical so you get Michelle wolf dancing to avoid that's right you have to dance to abortion I don't know how they back out of this though it seems like they're driving themselves into a kind of Walter Mondale position they're getting themselves so radicalized they're pushing so to the fringes of their party and means in some ways you have to thank Donald Trump for this Trump is the guy who makes them they react to him he just dangles a little bait out there it's why I'm really hoping mr. president if you're watching the Amy Kony Barrett pick would be so perfect because one it for many reasons it would troll the Democrats out of their minds she's clearly the yeah among the most reliable possible judges but also it will make this a religious war yeah no you're right you're right they will try to pass a religious test against Amy Kony Barrett and I think we win that which is actually written in the Constitution you cannot do that they haven't read that well I hope during your show you're gonna explain to Walter Mondale is it to people will you be talking about today I've got a grover norquist on we're going to talk about we're gonna be talking about actually forget about all this abortion stuff we're talking about the most important issue which is low taxes absolutely Grover Norquist actually I I don't even this might be some new information of moves that the Trump administration is going to do too seriously increase economic Liberty in America and lower your taxes they can do it from the executive this is an amazing stuff that he's talking about and I've got some thoughts on Tommy Lauren that I'll have to uh yeah oh so long I saw you on Twitter all right skew later no thanks Andrew let's go right into our crappy culture all right well speaking of God I want to talk about the church that is currently my church but any yeah there is now a move in the Episcopal Church they are considering overhauling the Book of Common Prayer to take out gendered language when you talk about God so when you refer to God you will neither use the male or female pronouns I guess or any kind of reference to this and this is one of the reasons I'm serious I'm seriously looking for another church I mean there's an Episcopal Church right at the bottom of my hill and in LA that's everything because of traffic you know I mean if there were a mosque at the bottom of my hell I'd become a Muslim at this point you know because of the traffic but but the Episcopal Church has lost its mine now here's the thing I tweeted about this over the weekend and somebody responded well God is above gender and of course that is true God is beyond gender we know this because he created male and female in His image right so it's not a question of God's in nature that has nothing to do with anything it is a question of the language of the Gospels and the Bible and the Old Testament the language that they use is gendered so in speaking to our shallow limited Minds the author ultimate author of the Bible found it meet and write to refer to God the Father to have heard the father and the son to refer to you know the to use gendered language and referring to God so the only question here the only question being debated is who knows best the Bible or the Episcopal Church that is the only question being debated because as Thomas soil was fond of saying it's not what's right or wrong it's who decides what's right or wrong and if you are basically based on the Bible if that is your sacred book it might be that you should think you should feel that the Bible knows better than you do and it is part and parcel of the leftist this leftist idea that the world should be run from the top down that the priests and the people you know they used to say there used to be a joke in Episcopal churches what separates the Conservatives from the Liberals in the Episcopal Church it was the altar rail in other words the creation was conservative but the priests are liberal but after a while when the priest becomes so radicalized when they become so unanswerable to their parishioners when they become so uninsurable to their sacred texts ultimately people walk away they have turned the radicals in the Episcopal Church I've turned this church into what used to be called the Republican Party at prayer there are now fewer Episcopalians in America than Jews and you cannot believe how few Jews there are in America I believe that's right I'm saying that from memory but I believe that's true however there's gonna be one less very soon because I'm finding this intolerable I find it intolerable that they look at the language of the Gospels and by the way this is not an isolated incident I I have been when I travel around I'll stop off in to a church and take Mass and I've gone into Episcopal churches in New York where the guy will literally preach against the gospel and say the gospel says this but this is appalling this can't be this can't be right you know you think like dude get another job you don't have to be an Episcopal you don't have to be a priest just get another job you know it's it's ridiculous to put yourself up as a priest of the gospel then preach against the gospel to say that your language is better than biblical language is classic leftism because it is from the top we are the experts we are the elite we know best you will do what we say and that's where you start to become violent towards your fellow man and start to characterize their disagreements as racism and sexism and all the rest all right the show went by very quickly didn't it yeah it's so but tomorrow is another day and we will be here tomorrow with a guest do we know who our guest will be oh this is good stuff this is about the administrative state and how they are why is so important some of the stuff that's Trump is doing and what needs to be done so you don't lose your freedom to some faceless bureaucrat idiot who comes to your house and declares your toilet a water way so he can regulate when you use it all right it will be there tomorrow I'll be there you be there I'm Andrew Clavin this
