so the way is was the main concern it's a massively heavy piece of kit and all the different components are also really really heavy so there's two huge chillers and that take up masses of electricity there's the water itself which has them frozen smoke ice there's all of the different chilling pipes there's all of the pumps getting up there was was a really big task because we had to actually get a crane in to lift all the kit up so we had a day of training everything all together it weighs a lot but obviously it being an old car part just made for holding master Cement away
