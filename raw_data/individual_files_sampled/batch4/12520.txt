so what's the deal with President Trump these days he's making deals with Democrats he said he was gonna build a wall and now he's pushing the dreamer act and Hillary Clinton is doing a book tour when he said he was gonna lock her up so is he giving it to the people he who got him in office is he betraying them what's up with that we'll take a look at that there's also an amazing new movement among Millennials and not just Millennials it may change the way you think about the culture entirely we will talk about all that plus the mailbag so will solve all your problems but first the federal government under the leadership of Donald Trump has so far been doing a terrific job handling the natural disasters that have struck the south here's a brief montage of newscasters praising the president for his excellent leadership okay that was a little more brief than I was expecting but there's more good news the economy is starting to really boom with the stock market skyrocketing employment and income on the rise poverty levels finally falling so here's a montage of commentators discussing how the White House is making America great again hah Wow they say in journalism that good news is no news so maybe the press just wants to focus on where things have gone wrong so for instance now that it's become pretty clear president Trump had absolutely nothing to do with the Russians who had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election journalists are engaged in a period of deep soul-searching trying to figure out how they could have wasted so much of America's time over a story that really wasn't very important at all here's a sample of some of the presses self-criticism hi I'm Joseph the American mainstream media is still the same corrupt biased hate-filled corrupt leftist dishonest corrupt immoral corrupt biased corrupt organ of misinformation it's been for the last 20 years or so according to our good friends at the media Research Center the network's evening news spent the summer trashing the president with coverage that was 91% negative this is a grand total of three percent worse than the eighty nine percent negative coverage the network's were giving Trump before the summer network executives are launching a full investigation into what took them so long to squeeze out that extra 3% of hate and vitriol journalists justify their negative bias left this corrupt dishonest hate-filled corrupt bias coverage by pointing out the ways in which President Trump deserves their attacks as Hillary Clinton spokesman an ABC News man George Stephanopoulos says quote Trump has done some truly terrible things like winning the election when we wanted him to lose and being a Republican when we're all Democrats also he doesn't panic and knuckle under when we call him racist which makes him an absolutely horrible person unquote CNN's Jim Acosta added quote look at me I'm Jim Acosta I can stand on my head and shout ignorant non sequiturs at the same time look at me I'm Jim Acosta look at me under the relentless media attacks president Trump's approval ratings have now risen to around 45% whereas the media's approval rating has now sunk from shut up you snake hearted dirtbags to kiss my butt you lying pieces of garbage the president looks forward to pushing his negative coverage up to a hundred percent to serve his goal of achieving re-election by winning every single state in the country trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show life is tickety-boo there's a real need also say a tipsy

stamps.com enter que la VA and stamps com I will never have to send my wife to the post office again alright so let's take a look at this you know it really is it really is interesting president Trump's ratings are actually going up and I predict they're going to continue to go up unless there's some terrible terrible disaster Politico has a big article out now that everything they've done regressive threw everything at this guy everything I mean Russia his base sticks with him and once he starts to do well and certainly once the economy takes off you know people who weren't with them before will also be with him and so everything they've done it just hasn't worked so last night President Trump had a dinner with a three Democrats and I think four Republican senators to talk about he's pushing his tax reform deal he knows he's gonna need some Democrats on there if they're not if Mitch McConnell is not gonna get rid of this ridiculous filibuster rule he knows he's gonna need maybe 60 votes maybe they can do it through reconciliation and get it through that's that's also possible but this comes on the heels of his making this deal with as we now call him Chuck and Nancy suddenly suddenly from crying shocked and crazy Nancy Pelosi there Chuck and Nancy Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi he made this deal to extend the debt ceiling only three months when the Republicans are certainly the conservatives were touting their 18-month plan they wanted to keep it going now Mitch McConnell by the way I just should add this in there that Mitch McConnell says that it's not really three months it'll be spring before they have to deal with the debt ceiling because they're allowed to move money around all these kind of complex Senate rules but also Donald Trump is is now pushing passage of the DREAM Act I mean this Bush couldn't do it Obama couldn't do it he's not only saying once passage of the DREAM Act he's tweeting to dreamers don't worry even though we've rescinded the executive order against dreamers we're not going to throw you out of the country and we're not gonna take any action while Congress is dealing with this so we're not gonna you know we're not gonna come after you so I mean this comes after let's face it this is remember we remember all those meetings those rallies that he held where they were screaming you know build the wall build the wall still happening when he does rallies not just in the campaign they're still shouting build the wall and Trump is saying that they're not going to attach any doc I'll as legislation any DREAM Act legislation doesn't have to be attacked attached to wall is funding so he's basically giving that game away too so the question is is east his two questions is he stabbing his supporters in the back and do we care I mean those are the two questions because we I I should say I'm a conservative I'm not a Trumpster Trump listen Trump is so far far far better deal than Hillary Clinton ever would have been and anybody who says oh you know like well if we had Hillary Clinton and we had a Republican Congress left the Republican Congress has never done anything to help anybody well they held up Obama but still he did all those had got all those judge appointments all those regulations that he put in there and now Trump is really putting some really good judges not just in the Supreme Court but right down the line these are things that can never be taken back you know and I mean regulations can be rolled back but they almost never are and they are under the Trump administration so he's doing a lot of good things from a conservative point of view but here's areas the Guardian right this is this left-wing British publication and they're selling this this narrative the mainstream establishment Republican leadership made a cynical calculation to tolerate Donald Trump's dangerous faults believing they could use him to rubber-stamp their long sought conservative led slative agenda now every word in that sentence is untrue that just doesn't actually isn't does not describe what happened they made a bargain with a con man and now he has betrayed them his deal last week with truck Schumer Nancy Pelosi on debt limits and disaster spending is a huge political betrayal but make no mistake for Trump it's good politics Americans are fed up with gridlock and dysfunction in the Washington DC swamp and they blame Republicans as much as Democrats furthermore the legislation which might pass by making deals with Democrats polls well across the political spectrum okay so let's let's start with the whole immigration thing because from my perspective immigration was never the big problem people thought it was what was what was the problem was the lawlessness it's a problem to have your government say we're not going to enforce the law because we're not I mean that is an arrogant tyrannical government they should have to pass laws not through executive orders and get them through Congress and then they should have to enforce them and every time Obama said I'm not going to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act I thought like well what's the difference then between him and a king I mean we elect these guys they make legislation we may not like the legislation so we have to change it but how if the president just says oh yeah I'm gonna use prosecutorial you know judgment and we're not gonna prosecute those laws then the laws don't exist so he's just swiping the laws away just like a king and I think that that is the thing that really bothered me about immigration it wasn't rapist and murderer Mexicans coming in I mean we've handled plenty of immigration before but you got to do it legally you got to have a border you got to check people through you got to take the people you want and tell the people who you don't want that they can't come in so let's take a look at this at this dinner that went on last night three of the three Democrats who were there all come from states that Trump won big right and they're all kind of conservative so you have Heidi Heitkamp and you have Joe Donnelly from Indiana and Joe Manchin is the big one from the West Virginia and Manson has been he's been a kind of moderate guy you know he supports gun rights he's been against abortion you know he's done a lot of things to work across the aisle so he came out after the meeting after this dinner and he said you know there was a bipartisan feeling there's cutting - it was a very in-depth conversation start out with infrastructure Joe talked a lot about infrastructure gary went into detail and the president you know basically back and forth of what we could do the exciting things that can happen how we can work together public-private but also public-private means not just turning things over to the private sector and they're going to own it and run it but basically building it quicker and faster getting through the minutiae of all the you know the time constraints of eight to ten years to build something we should be able to do it and permit it in two years so we got into that and then we got right in the depth of tax reform and the president was adamant from the get-go this is not a tax cut for the rich and I repeat that this will not be a tax cut for me or any rich people that kind of started out the conversation it went pretty good from there so he comes out of there happy these are three guys who have not joined the rest of the Democrats in the resistance today they did vote for instance for Gorsuch for the supreme court to approve courses for the supreme court and you know the thing about infrastructure is there's going to be an infrastructure bill Democrats love this but Democrats want it to be all government spending so they control that they control hiring gives us tremendous power over who gets hired who gets contracts gives them tremendous power to take graft which Democrats love and you know what Trump is hoping to do is kind of work out some sort of private public thing which would be a little bit more conservative it would be a moderate program and of course the tax thing you know they've got to cut corporate taxes they have not cut me you know let's let's hear a little bit more about mansion on this he talks about this at number three cut number three what they're talking about for tax reform tax reform our tax cuts whatever you want to do has to be done to where it stimulates the economy grows the economy on a global basis is competitive you know we didn't create the market global market but we've got to compete in it next of all we can't continue to add to twenty trillion dollars so you have to be very sensitive know you can't add on that we've got to see a pathway forward to start bringing this that down and get ourselves fiscally responsible and I think that's what that conversation was last night and what I heard and willing to you know really willing to explore all avenues of this understanding that Democrats responsible and moderate some of us conservative Democrats who are looking for fiscal responsibility you know I've always said this I'm fiscally responsible and socially compassionate so so here's an example where Trump is actually not betraying his base at all that base knew he was going to do this this is what he talked about some of us conservatives may be a little nervous about all the infrastructure spending we may be nervous that he's gonna lose those corporate tax cuts as those are the big ones this really is not the middle-class tax cuts it's the corporate tax cuts there's a reason for that his money gets taxed when it moves money gets taxed when you spend something when I spend something when employer gives it to you when money is in motion it gets taxed so you can cut corporate taxes expand business expand employment expand production and all these things and actually when you cut the rate you actually make more money because the money get stabbed is moving a lot faster hey I have to pause there for just a moment and talk about the fact that I just look fabulous and I know I know this is it's distracting you know so I want to get to it I know you're sitting here listening well taxes are interesting but what do you do look so good and the reason is Beachbody on demand which is an online

each body on demand alright so I just have to stop about the mansion thing because this is really funny he's on what was he gone I guess I think it was CBS acbs because it was Charlie Rose and he a mansion comes in and he's been the dinner with the president and his bipartisan dinner so it's news it's real story they start to run out of time here is the question they asked mansion this is the question they have got to know about this dinner cut number four before you go we gotta go but before you go what was the menu chicken beef fish what was it it was a mess it was a medallion it was a big medallion hate to pry but did you have one scoop or two scoops of ice cream no no we had let me tell you the ice cream was so perfectly prepared the ice cream came beside the dessert deal yeah it looked like an egg and I said I wonder why I'm getting an egg with my dessert and I cut into it and it was a it was beautifully sculptured ice cream love dessert did you did he more desserts than you no he did not he unbelievable they hate this guy so much no matter what happens in this country if he blows North Korea off the face of the earth no matter what he does if the economy comes roaring back they hate him personally and it's not working it is not keeping his it's not keeping his poll numbers down Trump has really done everything that has kept his poll numbers down has been generated by Trump himself with cookie tweets and not getting the thing and by the Congress not getting giving him the deals he wants but look this thing with the immigration thing it doesn't bother me that much he is enforcing immigration illegal immigration is way down I don't think a wall is gonna make any difference but when a guy gets up at every rally and says we're gonna build a wall in Mexico is gonna pay for it he ought to build a wall and the people who hold him who supported them oughta hold and responsible for that but do I care no as a conservative I just want the rule of law enforced that is happening the ice agents are allowed to work again the ice agents love Trump because he set them free to do their jobs so so the answer the two questions yeah I think so far he has not done what he told his supporters he's going to do do I care no and one of the funny things about me of course is because I was not a big Trump believer I always knew he was not good things he said I mean here is let's go back and just remember remember all those chants of lock him up just like a month ago weeks ago he was held a rally and they were shouting lock Hillary Clinton up lock Hillary Clinton up well now a little Hillary Clinton is roaming around free she's going out there you know selling her book and let's just go back for a minute to the one of the debates where Trump said he was gonna have a special prosecutor appoint appointed to investigate the fact that she destroyed emails that were under subpoena for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 emails again you should be ashamed of yourself what you did and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Clinton so recently Jeff Sessions said he's not going to prosecute Louis learner who was head of the eye who was right in the thick of that IRS scandal where the IRS was targeting and it probably is still targeting conservative groups and not giving them breaks so that they could use you know tax breaks to spread their ideas during an election year it was very effective it really kind of undermined the Tea Party as they were gaining steam it's and Obama was good at that Obama was a master politician he was a chicago paul he knew how to break the backs of his enemies he really did and he knew how to he knew you know one of the things that obama knew is he knew how it can be important not to pass a law to lose at passing a law but to win on making it look like the other side was to blame and the other side is looks mean like he did with the DREAM Act so anyway now Jeff session says he's not gonna prosecute Lois Lerner and and that's a tough one I mean I look I like Jeff Sessions I suspect if he can't prosecutors cuz he just can't get the case he wants together and he doesn't want to spend public money chasing her around if he's not going to catch her but it really is interesting plus they're making charges you know you saw Steve Bannon the other day said that firing James Comey was one of the biggest political mistakes ever so they asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders about this at the press conference and she says yeah this guy has really broken the law you know Comey has broken the law so she's asking answering the questions was it was a mistake to fire him this is cut six the president is proud of the decision that he made the president was 100% right in firing James Comey he knew at the time that it could be bad for him politically but he also knew and felt he had an obligation to do what was right and do what was right for the American people and certainly the men and women at the FBI I think there's no secret Comey by his own self admission leaked privileged government information weeks before President Trump fired and cumming testified that an FBI agent engaged in the same practice they'd face serious repercussions I think he set his own stage for himself on that front his actions were improper and likely could have been illegal coming leaked memos to the New York Times your own outlet he politicized an investigation by signaling he would exonerate Hillary Clinton before he ever interviewed her or other key witnesses he's very happy with the decision he made and I think he's been fully vindicated by a lot of those new things and knowing that it was the right one so then the next question of a reporter asks her or a couple of questions over his are you gonna put him away if he broke the law and she says that is not the president's job it's not the president's job to appoint a special counsel it's not at the president's job to decide whether to indict and whether to prosecute so now that he's dealing with the reality of it you know it's it's a lot different it's a lot different to ask Jeff Sessions to go after Hillary Clinton to ask him to go after James Comey it you know all those chants of lock him up lock him up and it's entirely possible and this is something because conservatives are none'll conservatives are not only laughing at his supporters they're laughing at conservatives who said well you know we'll see what we can get out of this guy but but really that's silly because it's very possible that his supporters understood that he was carrying them along on a motion huh but they hoped he would still they still hoped he would do a better job than anybody else who's going to go on there and be more responsible to them and I think on that score he is even though he hasn't fulfilled his promises it's a really weird situation because Trump is a very emotional figure and people are attached to him emotionally and those of us who care about policy are kind of confused well well he said he would do this but he's not doing that but I don't think that's what people are following him for I think they're following him for an attitude and I think he's fulfilled delivered that attitude in spades you know I have to have my picture taken a lot and this for somebody like me look I'm a writer I've been a writer all my life I became a writer because I like to hide in a room by myself thinking thoughts and writing them down so it has always been a shock to me to find myself out and people asking to take pictures with me and for a long time I would not smile you can go back and look at pictures I wouldn't smile because my teeth were dark and I have no idea what was finally asked someone asked the lady who cleans my teeth how can I keep him clean she says get an electric toothbrush so I got this electric toothbrush I had three guys carry it because it's so big okay but now there is quip which is an electric toothbrush that is just beautifully designed it's thin it's small it works on batteries instead of having to be

you get a year subscription and you can drink Hillary's tears in this beautiful tumbler left this to your tumblr come on over so just to finish off this thought Trump is in some sense not delivering the things that he told his supporters he would deliver but we don't necessarily have to care because it doesn't mean he's he's doing a bad job and it doesn't mean that it certainly doesn't mean that we conservatives are getting a worse deal than we would have get gotten if the only other choice ballot had been elected I think we're getting a much better deal than we would have gotten there gonna be things up ahead so far because I don't care that much about immigration except as a point of law so far he hasn't done anything that has made my teeth grind together but he will he's going to do some left-wing stuff that's gonna drive me crazy and maybe you crazy too so we'll watch for that but so far all he's doing is getting the Gov the gears of government moving again after eight years of an uncompromising ideologue in Obama who really did jam things up so if he starts to get a little bipartisan support that wouldn't be entirely a bad thing the mailbag I love I miss her I miss all right from Isaac supreme overlord Clavin a wise one bringer of truth and destroyer of darkness thank you for just reading my business card I appreciate that yeah I am studying abroad in Germany this year and will be traveling around Europe as well I was wondering what were your favorite places to see and visit in Europe well I lived in Europe for seven years and traveled all over I think my favorite my favorite city in Europe is still London it's not you know it's not what it was London it is so so super crowded that it is kind of hard to enjoy unless you can get it on off season off hours but it's still a beautiful beautiful city one of the great walking cities I love to walking is one of the great cities the other city I I just love Rome if you haven't seen Rome you have to go because Rome one of the things about Europe that is really interesting is the history is so present that you can feel it coming up through your feet and I found living in Europe this sounds weird but I found that living in Europe I worried less about the fact that people died because you felt like you were part of this chain antek thing that had been going on and on and would continue without you and was there before you and it was a very relaxing feeling it's the opposite living here in Los Angeles where there's no history whatsoever Rome I just loved I because of the layers of history and not only have ancient Rome you also have the Christian era of the medieval era of everything and all of it has left its traces in the city and so it's just all there and of course that the wonderful wonderful Renaissance art that is everywhere throughout the city where else I love Edinboro Edinboro so much underrated city and all our friends at the Daily wire taking a trip to Edinboro and I told him it was one of my favorite cities in town I loved traveling in Switzerland Switzerland is the only landscape I have ever seen that can match the American landscape if you've never I've traveled too raw a lot around America I've been in every state except North Dakota I think I'm in every single state and it's a beautiful country America but the Alps in Switzerland there's nothing like them when you see the Alps you can a 16 a movie star you know when you see like a really big movie star you go like wow that's so it's looks so real you know that's what the Alps look like the Alps just completely blow you away and you can hike some of the most beautiful hikes ever all right from Steve dear sir who has so many titles of brilliance that I'll forget one when properly addressing you and I wouldn't want to disrespect you in that manner so I hope you're alright with me calling you sir Clavin actually it's Lord Clavin throughout the summer I have been struggling with lust whenever I see attractive women I tend to think lustful thoughts and have had lustful dreams in my sleep what are some ways to help refocus how I view my fellow female peers as children of God well that you know that's really interesting because I always try to answer the question that I'm asked not the question that I think is coming or the question that the listeners want to hear I always try to answer the question you ask them so what he's saying is what are some ways to help refocus how I view my fellow female peers as children of God which is a really good question because women don't understand this women do not know what it is to be especially a young man obviously you cool off a little bit as you go on but but when you're a young man women do not understand the force of the desire that men live with the desire not just for to have sex with women but the desire to have sex with various women so that being married is can be a real trial on there are certain days when you just think nah I got to you know I have to have variety I have to this is built into the system it is it is put there by God it is what we are how we are made you know so it's not something that you're gonna be fighting it's now people always quote Jesus when he said you know you've heard it said that thou shalt not commit adultery but even if you have lust in your heart that is adultery but I don't think Jesus is saying therefore you're a bad guy what he's saying therefore you are in a state of sin you this is not what man was made to be be originally but it is what we are now so the question is not how can you get rid of your lust you can't I mean that is the way men feel and it is it's really difficult especially like I said when you're young it is really difficult dealing with women my father gave me he never he did not give me a lot of good advice but this is a great piece of advice he gave me I'm going to translate it out of out of obscenity because we was obscene when he gave it to me but basically when I was a young man and I became I grew up during the 60s and things got very sexual very fast for me and he gave me the piece of advice he said just remember that every one of those beautiful bought women's bodies as a human being inside okay that's not quite how he put it but let's say that that was the idea and that is something that I always have tried to remember that the person you're talking to is not just a form and a shape that excites you is actually a person with an entire universe inside herself that is that is there and that's and that is look you're not your body you are a person you are a full complete person your body is one component of that your body is doing what your body is supposed to do your body is supposed to desire and reproduce and have sex and yet and begin a new generation that is one of the things your body is made to do but you are not your body and in dealing with human beings you can lust after them all you want but just remember that there's a human being inside that shape that you lust for and and treat her that way treat her that way you know it'll it'll actually improve your life in general I hope that I hope that's helpful there's nothing I can say that'll make the lust go away you know it like I said it cools overtime but it never goes away well maybe I shouldn't say that maybe it does eventually but takes its time it takes its time leaving from Daniel would you recommend a couple getting a prenuptial agreement before marriage in my view getting one seems to convey an underlying lack of trust but then again there's so many marriages ending in divorce I you know for that for the very reason you say I would not recommend a prenuptial agreement unless unless there is a fantastic disparity of wealth in which case it is for instance in California I think the law is I'm talking off the top of my head but I think the law is that basically the minute you get married your property is common property so if you are some movie star and you marry a waitress you know it really isn't fair that you might that marriage might fall apart within a year and she might take half your goods there really isn't fair and the same thing it works the other way if the woman is the one with all the money if there's not that big disparity I really believe that married couples should join their fortunes together completely I do not believe in separate bank accounts I don't believe in separate vacations I don't believe in keep a woman keeping her maiden name I believe that when you get married you become one flesh and that should be reflected in everything you do so basically I would just say you know I mean you you know your bank account is your bank account and your property is your property and I think California is basically right about this divorce is a genuine problem but you shouldn't go into a marriage expecting divorce you should go into a marriage expecting that to be the rest of your life so I don't really recommend prenuptial agreements before marriage unless as I say there's some explicit reason there's some real reason why a divorce would render the outcome so unfair so unfair that you need some protection otherwise most people tend to get married when they they don't have all that much and I think that you know you should just get married and join your fortunes together from Sakaki dear overseer of the universe Clavin that is my part might that's my moonlighting job were you a virgin before you got married I'm worried that since I am NOT a virgin it may be harmful to my future marriage if she is still a virgin is that true you know I was not like I said I grew up in the 60s things really got nuts you know one year when I was say twelve or thirteen I would have thought of course you're a virgin when you get married and then the culture just shifted it was like a an absolute earthquake and everything was different and little kids and I that's essentially what I was we're having sex we were having sex and you know that was the way of life it it's I wouldn't recommend it I wouldn't recommend it but but on the other hand I also would not trade it I wouldn't trade the relationships I had most of my relationships with women have been incredibly friendly and loving and kind there have been a few bad ones in there but you know I wouldn't trade those relationships for anything no it doesn't have to be harmful to your wife if she's a virgin and if she doesn't get obsessed with you're thinking about you know you're having other people in your past she has to not get obsessed you have to keep your mouth shut it's not something she needs to hear about if the women contact you from your past and that has happened to me you should very quickly put the kibosh on that as we used to say if you very quickly shut it down your your first loyalty your first interest should be in keeping giving your wife a peaceful happy trusting life you shouldn't be emailing old flames you shouldn't be texting people that she doesn't know about you shouldn't be carrying on relationships online that could be construed as sexual in any way you be faithful you be loving you be affectionate and your past is your past you can't change the past so it doesn't matter right but it's not necessarily hurtful also of course before you get married get a blood test make sure you're not passing anything on besides your genes um all right last one I guess we got a wind-up greetings all-powerful ruler of the multiverse have you or anyone you know personally ever had a near-death experience if so has its strength instead person's faith and or given them a more easygoing outlook on life I find myself thinking more about much mortality and while I'm a Catholic I still find myself being fearful of what's after this life thanks for reading Dave I do know woman who had a near-death experience it was a literally I mean she died and she had a she was a young woman and she had a I think a heart attack and she died and I saw her not long after at a party and she in fact saw her she lifted out of her body and was aware of what the doctors were doing and she could see everything from a different point of view and then she was brought back into her body and the funny thing about her is she was kind of a communist kind of a materialist left as she had no beliefs and she still didn't have any belief after it was over so I said well what what do you think and she said well you know I thought like really your vouchsafed vision of the afterlife and it didn't change your opinion who knows maybe since then it was pretty soon after she had it that it but I do but look there's so many reports of them I do believe in them I do think they're true I the only mystical experience I ever had it is in my book the great good thing in my memoir about my conversion when my daughter was born I was actually swept I had an out-of-body experience I was actually swept out of my body it was completely real it wasn't an illusion I was totally aware I actually experienced the flow of my love for my wife which is intense and ongoing bleeding into my love for this new child and then I started to lose myself in what I saw with my own eyes and by the way I was not a believer at the time and anything I saw with my own eyes was a sea of love I actually saw I was being swept away in a sea of love and I got scared and I pulled back into my body because I was afraid it was going to be swept away I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't done that so you know I do believe in these things I've seen them for myself there was no way for me to explain it I'm a very down-to-earth person I don't go around having mystical experiences I do believe and after death experiences and if that gives you any faith great otherwise I would say go for the faith because look if there's nothing if there's nothing you're not gonna know about it anyway there's nothing to worry about all right it's time for tickety-boo news so this is a kind of a different way of looking at the news a different way of looking at the world around us cuz I think you know there's just so much it's not that I'm looking for good news it's that I'm looking for reality I'm looking for the constant flow of attacks and bad news and anger and rage to just part and let's see what's really going on and I think sometimes it for conservatives it is it just seems like the culture is against us it is against us that the Democrats the left runs Hollywood it runs the academies you know they're doing a fundraiser for hurricane relief and the last time they did this remember with Katrina that's where Kanye West got up and said george w bush doesn't like black people and they've given like you know so Stevie Wonder who a lot of I'm not a big Stevie Wonder fan but I recognize his talent he's he says he gives the speech listen to this speech is incredible they just can't stop and they can't hear themselves either because listen to what he says we've come together today to love on the people that have been devastated by the hurricanes when love goes into action it purposes no color of skin note ethnicity no religious beliefs no sexual preferences and no political persuasions it just loves as we should begin to love and value our planet and anyone who believes that there's no such thing as global warming must be blind or unintelligent so every I'm not even gonna go for the cheap blind joke but I mean he goes there's love it's for everyone it doesn't matter your politics your sexuality your race your cuz it's love it's love but you if you don't believe what I believe you're an idiot they're so convinced of what they think they're so good they're so wrapped up in the bubble of what they believe that they don't see how they insult people and what you see and especially you see this in the light night night comedy shows you see them training up their audience to believe what they believe and that's what makes us so feel like we have no chance to get these people back you know the politics is downstream from culture in the jail listen here's Jimmy Kimmel anybody any comedian who doesn't look at Hillary Clinton now and come up with material about this is not doing his job he's not doing his job so Jimmy Kimmel is now this is cut number one he does a thing where he has loozy the poo right he's Hillary Clinton as loozy the poo but even as he's making fun of her he can't make fun of her it's gotta ball be about about Trump and it's got to be about you know the fact that she she shouldn't have lost but listen he makes one slight joke about her and listen to the audience react listen to the speak once upon a time not long ago November night to be precise piglet was skipping through the woods when he happened upon his friend Lucy the Pooh eating a giant jar of her feelings what's wrong Luzi asked the clearly uninformed piglet what's wrong I was supposed to be the first Pooh president I've been preparing for this since I was a cub all the polls had me winning so how did you lose question piglet well it was better prepared in the debates to foreign policy experience a Secretary of State and I won the popular vote in a landslide I'm lost said paper that sounds great yes but I never hosted a reality show or put my name on vodka or grab the Heffalump by the woozle or visited Wisconsin added piglet let out a big sigh and stared into the distance well at least I'll never have to deal with that loud orange lunatic ever again muttered luzie and suddenly out of nowhere losing her double so then it just becomes Trump bashing as all the way always on every late-night comedy monologue ever but you heard that the one time he mentioned the fact that Hillary lost because she campaigned badly oh the audience they're being trained they're like they're like trained dogs who are being taught there's only one narrative this is what it is you know and we are going to and you and you if you are a good person you are going to subscribe to that narrative now here's the thing so that's late-night TV that's all the power houses that's all the mainstream media that's being what's being fed wherever you go you want to see Stevie Wonder you got to listen to climate change you want to watch Jimmy Kimmel you got to get get the guy you voted for get watch them get slapped around every single night over and over and over again they just feel they own this culture here is a youtube star that we've had on a couple times she's just come out there's her name is Candice Owens with the myth of the Coon she is this app so if you can't see it she's an absolutely beautiful black girl this is her response to all of this I love this here's the thing famous ladies and gents nobody cares what you think nobody nobody cares what you think we don't care I love this so here's IRA's Elizabeth Ames at the Fox website the mainstream media fit failed to see the rise of Donald Trump in 2016 now it's overlooking another grassroots movement that may soon be of equal significance the growing number of liberals quote taking the red pill people of all ages and ethnicities are posting YouTube videos describing red pill moments personal awakenings that have caused them to reject leftist narratives imbibe since childhood from friends teachers and the news and entertainment media and of course you remember the red pill comes from the matrix here's the famous scene you are a slave neo like everyone else you were born into bondage born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch a prison for your mind unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to see it for yourself this is your last chance after this there is no turning back you take the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want you take the red pill you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes okay so if you haven't seen the matrix this is gonna be a bit of a spoiler but I'm just assuming everybody knows what it's about the matrix is the fact that the entire world they live is an illusion and they are being used human beings are being used as batteries to power smih Sheen's right they're powering machines you know they they're being but to keep them quiet to keep them in their little cocoons where they are all wired up to these machines to suck out their brain energy they give them this illusion that is what the Democrats and the left is to do they give you the illusion of virtue they give you illusion that you're living in this world of virtue to get power to take power from you and people are finding out and they call it taking the red pill so let's just look at a couple of these just a couple of clips of this YouTube things it's mostly young people but it's all kinds of people really just saying they took the the red pill here's the descent report essentially I took the red pill by a combination of few different things for one I saw really most of my friends on Facebook and in person but largely on social media moving extremely far to the left towards an authoritarian sort of progressivism they took these these liberal ideas and they turn them into suppression of anything that stood in their way so it became fairly evident very quickly that these people weren't actually standing up for anything relating to liberty really they were they were just standing up for for a divisive brand of politics that would it would tolerate no dissent whatsoever okay so that was a guy who saw this on Facebook right he saw the hatred and by the way this has been really intense I mean I know a lot of people who are conservatives but they're quiet conservatives they're moderate conservatives they don't go out around talking about it and suddenly they're looking on Facebook and they're seeing their friends leashing this victory all this hatred and they're like wow if they said that to my face you know they that would be a terrible terrible thing but they're saying on Facebook they don't understand that they're talking to human beings maybe they don't know about their friends political persuasion so they're just saying this hateful thing and now these guys are seeing they hate and here is the other one this is a woman named Kirsten Lauren so that was a guy who saw it on Facebook saw it on the news essentially here's a woman named Kristin Lauren talking about her experience that she did something she's not very specific about she did something that almost destroyed her life because she was following left-wing precepts I have taken the red pill so that it's matrix reference but it also has a lot to do with politics and the worldview and after this experience I took the red pill and I can't unsee what I see in the world now I can't remove my perspective just for comfort anymore it's like the world is a bad place and our society is soaked up and it's going to hell and hell and hell faster thanks just so many reasons that that people just are throwing everything away and I almost threw everything of mine away because I was following my environment I was following what I thought was right I was following the advice of people who I thought cared about me I was following the advice of my society see that I mean that I find that very moving because that's the other thing conservatives are not trying to hurt anybody they're trying to help people you know when we talk tough and we tell you what reality is we tell you you know that you're not a girl just because you put on a dress when we tell you that you're not being compassionate when you give out welfare to people and hook them on they say we're not trying to hurt people we're trying to help people and she had that as a personal experience that wasn't on Facebook she made decisions based on what the society as she says was telling her and suddenly realized ooh oh that was a close call she said it was like a bullet grazing her you know that came that close another woman is this Cassie J who was making a documentary a feminist who was making a documentary about men the men's rights movement meaning to attack them and started listening to their arguments and thought wow they're right they're right you know and that's and that was and she stopped being a feminist and then found that her relationship with her boyfriend surprise surprise really improves suddenly her life started to improve as well you know the thing about it is is listen we we are now the leaders in trolling I think we have a great you know routine we're very funny on Twitter we just own Twitter conservatives I'm talking about Twitter we own Twitter we own the humor world these guys with their f Trump every night are not that funny we really are the conservative voice is now the voice of humor but we also have to deal we also have to deal in facts we have to deal in information and we have to deal in compassionate compassionate delivery of the truth because people are waiting for this message they are waiting to hear they have been cheated out of their birthright they have been cheated out of their American heritage they have been cheated out of the truth about the world and now that bill is coming do and they're taking the red pill they're getting angry we could start to win this fight we conservatives could start to win this fight if all if we just learn how to talk to them and how to welcome them when they come over it's good news actually who's coming on tomorrow I think it's critters Kurdish licks are gonna be on he has just written an article saying that Trump is doing exactly the right thing by dealing with the Democrats we will talk to them about that great guy really interesting to talk to I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we'll see you then
