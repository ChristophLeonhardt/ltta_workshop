cardi B and Nicki Minaj fighting disgraces women do you remember when fashion was all about showing off the best of women and the best of women's clothes it's an art form looking good is an art and it's centered around grace but apparently not anymore I saw a story on NBC about cardi B and Nicki Minaj both are apparently singers and artists being broken up after fighting at a fashion show NBC reports video circulating on social media shows cardi B lunging towards someone and being held back at harper's bazaar icons party Friday night cardi B reportedly threw one of her shoes at Minaj another video shows the Platinum rapper being escorted out of the event by security cardi B wearing a red dolce & gabbana gown was seen leaving the party with what appears to be a bump on her head she was barefoot great job ladies what a way to disgrace such a historic industry not only are the clothes becoming more and more bizarre and the models are looking but now we have famous role models fighting in front of the world's press you can wear as much a Dolce & Gabbana as you like but it doesn't make you a lady I'm sick of seeing this in the press women who could potentially be inspiring a whole generation of our girls lining up to the press fighting and behaving disgracefully I mean I think this is what they do to get attention nowadays and to the press doesn't pay attention to good female role models anymore they're just quietly to the side unfortunately it seems to me that good female role models are quite lacking these days but if you're looking for someone super stylish and super ladylike I suppose you need not look any further than our first lady just like princesses inspire little girls in Europe I hope that classy ladies like Melania might be able to inspire more of our young girls if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
