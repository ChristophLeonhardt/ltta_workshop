MEET WITH THEM LATER THIS WEEK.

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:03,299
SHEP?

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,500
>> Shep: THANKS, JOHN.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,735
LET'S TURN TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO

5
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:07,770
HAS COME FACE TO FACE WITH THE

6
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,605
NORTH KOREAN LEADER, BILL

7
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:14,910
RICHARDSON, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,512
THE U.N.

9
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:20,216
GOOD TO SEE YOU, AMBASSADOR.

10
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:20,916
>> THANKS, SHEP.

11
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:21,817
>> Shep: WE'RE NOT WARRING.

12
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:22,551
THAT'S GREAT.

13
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:23,919
ASIDE FROM THAT, WHAT DO YOU

14
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:24,220
THINK?

15
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,288
>> I'M TROUBLED BY THE

16
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:26,689
CONCESSIONS.

17
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,558
ONE, THE MILITARY EXERCISES.

18
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:34,096
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE -- THEY

19
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:35,998
ALWAYS WANT YOU TO GO FIRST.

20
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:38,234
THEN THEY STEP ASIDE AND DON'T

21
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:41,170
DO ANYTHING THAT WORRIES HE.

22
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,938
THE SECURITY GUARANTEE SAYING TO

23
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:44,473
KIM JONG-UN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

24
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:45,841
TRY TO KNOCK YOU OFF.

25
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,978
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE REGIME

26
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:50,246
CHANGE.

27
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:52,481
I HE SAY, I'VE BEEN INVOLVED

28
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:53,749
WITH THIS ISSUE A LONG TIME.

29
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,818
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MISSILE TESTS,

30
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:57,686
NUCLEAR DETONATIONS, THREATS,

31
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:59,388
ENORMOUS TENSION IN SOUTH KOREA

32
00:00:59,388 --> 00:00:59,989
AND JAPAN.

33
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,426
WE GOT A LOT OF TROOPS THERE.

34
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:05,728
AT LEAST THERE'S A PROCESS OF

35
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,396
DIPLOMACY GOING ON.

36
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:10,299
THERE'S A PROCESS OF

37
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:11,333
NORMALIZATION GOING ON.

38
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,036
THE FUSION OF SOME TENSION IN

39
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:15,504
THE PENINSULA.

40
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:18,107
I DO THINK KIM JONG-UN GAVE UP

41
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:19,275
NOTHING.

42
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,710
WHAT WE NEED TO DO THINK IS

43
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,679
FOLLOW-THROUGH WITH MAJOR STEPS,

44
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,714
IMMEDIATE MOMENTUM, GET POMPEO

45
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:28,784
TO MEET WITH HIM, SET UP WORKING

46
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:29,952
GROUPS ON DENUCLEARIZATION, ON

47
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,821
MISSILE TESTS, HUMAN RIGHTS.

48
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,490
I WISH WE RAISED HUMAN RIGHTS

49
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,357
MORE STRONGLY.

50
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:37,059
WE JUST KIND OF MENTIONED IT.

51
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:38,661
I AM PLEASED, SHEP.

52
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:40,830
I'VE BEEN A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE

53
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,667
OF GETTING THE REMAINS OF OUR

54
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,334
SOLDIERS BACK.

55
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,236
I BROUGHT SEVEN BACK IN THE BUSH

56
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:47,703
ADMINISTRATION.

57
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:48,604
THERE'S 5,000.

58
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:50,139
A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT WANT

59
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,240
THOSE REMAINS BACK.

60
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,475
I THINK THAT'S A POSSIBLE AREA

61
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:55,744
OF COOPERATION THAT THE

62
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,780
PRESIDENT MENTIONED AND MAYBE

63
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,082
KIM JONG-UN IS GOING TO RESTART

64
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:01,283
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

65
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,385
YOU KNOW, VERY SHORT ON

66
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:03,752
SPECIFICS.

67
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:06,889
ON SUBSTANCE AND FOLLOW-THROUGH,

68
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:08,556
TIMELINES AND VERIFICATION.

69
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:09,657
>> Shep: FROM THE PEOPLE WE

70
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:12,728
TALKED TO OR IN THE KNOW ABOUT

71
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:16,499
NORTH KOREA, SUE MI TERRY,

72
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:17,833
GORDON CHANG, PEOPLE LIKE THIS,

73
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,702
WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING NOW FOR

74
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:21,637
YEARS IS THAT HIS REGIME IS

75
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:22,838
SHAKY BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE DON'T

76
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:23,806
HAVE ANY FOOD.

77
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:26,909
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE'S

78
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,043
FAMILIES ARE LOCKED UP IN GULAGS

79
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:29,678
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

80
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:31,213
AT SOME POINTS HIS REGIME WILL

81
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:32,982
GET REALLY SHAKY.

82
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:34,750
THE LAST THING HE NEEDS IS A

83
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,785
PICK ME UP WITH A PHOTO

84
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:37,586
OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LEADER OF

85
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:38,320
THE FREE WORLD.

86
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,388
HE JUST GOT IT.

87
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,258
HOW BIG OF A HELP IS THAT?

88
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:45,094
OR IS ALL OF THAT TALK JUST

89
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:45,394
TALK?

90
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:47,363
>> IT DOES HELP.

91
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,098
THERE'S NO ELECTIONS THERE.

92
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,300
SOLIDIFIES HIM.

93
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,969
PUTS HIM ON PAR WITH THE

94
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:55,471
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

95
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:57,306
WITH HIS OWN PEOPLE.

96
00:02:57,306 --> 00:03:02,711
THE DEAL WITH THE GULAGS, TO THE

97
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,281
HUMAN RIGHTS PEOPLE, HE WANTS

98
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:06,415
HELP WITH INFRASTRUCTURE, HIS

99
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:06,982
ENERGY GRIDS.

100
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:09,018
IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST NATIONS

101
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:09,618
ON EARTH.

102
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:11,987
NO PRIVATE SECTOR.

103
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:14,089
FARMING IN THE 1930s, THEIR

104
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,157
EQUIPMENT.

105
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:17,826
WHERE YOU SAY TO HIM, LOOK, IF

106
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:19,395
YOU WANT AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY

107
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:20,496
INVESTMENT, YOU HAVE TO DEAL

108
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:23,399
WITH YOUR HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES

109
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,200
AND GULAGS.

110
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,901
THAT IS A TRADE-OFF THAT WE USE

111
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:29,605
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, SHEP.

112
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:30,639
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IS

113
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,241
CONDITIONED ON HUMAN RIGHTS

114
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:34,343
PERFORMANCE BY OTHER COUNTRIES.

115
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:35,778
WE SHOULD A SUPPLY THAT TO THEM.

116
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:38,547
>> Shep: HOW ARE THE CHINESE

117
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,481
FEELING ABOUT NOW?

118
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:41,850
>> THEY'RE PROBABLY HAPPY.

119
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,385
>> Shep: I GUESS THEY ARE.

120
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,920
>> I DON'T THINK THEY WANTED A

121
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,289
TIGHTER COMMITMENT IN

122
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:47,723
RELATIONSHIPS.

123
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:50,726
THEY LIKE TO CAUSE TROUBLE AND

124
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,895
TURMOIL FOR US.

125
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,197
THE WORRY THAT I HAVE IS THE

126
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:58,133
CHINESE WILL LOOSEN SANCTIONS.

127
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:01,537
THEY PUT MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON THE

128
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:02,504
SMUGGLING.

129
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:04,006
80% OF ALL COMMERCE FROM NORTH

130
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,641
KOREA GOES THROUGH CHINA.

131
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:08,043
SO THEY HAVE LEVERAGE.

132
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:09,645
THEY'RE PROBABLY SMILING BECAUSE

133
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,281
MAYBE THE STATUS QUO THAT THEY

134
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,250
LIKE, THE TURMOIL, IS RIGHT NOW

135
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,351
IN THE SHORT RUN WITHOUT

136
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,853
COMMITMENTS FROM THE NORTH

137
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:19,288
KOREANS IS HERE TO STAY.

138
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:20,322
>> Shep: GOTTA GO.

139
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:22,191
GOOD DAY, BAD DAY?

140
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,926
DON'T KNOW YET?

141
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:25,261
WHICH IS IT?

142
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:28,831
>> I THINK IT'S A GOOD DAY

143
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:31,066
INCHING TOWARDS A BAD DAY UNLESS

144
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:34,203
WE GET SOME COMMITMENTS AND

145
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:36,138

DAY.

160
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,046
>> POMPEO NEEDS TO MOVE IN

161
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:44,346
QUICK.

162
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:46,548
TAKE THE MOMENTUM FROM THIS

163
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:49,985
POSITIVE ISSUE OF MOVING CLOSER,

164
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:53,322
THE WAY THAT THE COUNTRIES ARE

165
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:54,890
MOVING AT LEAST CLOSER, THE

166
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,492
FUSION OF TENSION.

167
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,394
SEIZE ON THAT MOMENTUM TO GET

168
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:01,397
SOME COMMITMENTS.

169
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:02,898
OTHERWISE, THIS WILL GO BY THE

170
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:03,265
WAYSIDE.

171
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:05,067
>> Shep: HE'S A TALENTED MAP.

172
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,702
HIS NATION LOVES HIM.

173
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:07,603
>> I'M NOT SURE.

174
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:11,373
HIS NATION IS AFRAID OF HIM.

175
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:13,776
HIS NATION IS SCARED.

176
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:17,079
I THINK HIS NATION WANTS AN

177
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,980
OPPORTUNITY LIKE ALL PEOPLE TO

178
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,917
GET OUT OF THE DOLDRUMS.

179
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,686
MAYBE THEY SEE A SPARK IN

180
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:25,187
AMERICA BEING HELPFUL.

181
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:28,924
WHO KNOWS OR SOUTH KOREA BEING

182
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:29,258
HELPFUL.

183
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:31,126
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT NEED HELP

184
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:33,028
AND THEY NEED THE INTERNATIONAL

185
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,798
COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM GET OUT

186
00:05:35,798 --> 00:00:00,000
OF POVERTY AND HUNGER AND YOU
