nearly 15,000 students graduate with gender and cultural studies degrees each year 15,000 innocent young people calmed out of their money and left for brain dead it's a national disgrace what happens to a young person who has suffered this fate it's more than likely he or she were they or it or whatever the poor slob has been taught to call himself goes on to commit the same terrible crime against others that has been committed against him or it or whatevs by writing gender study or cultural study articles in peer-reviewed journals our crack team of hard-working researchers managed to unearth some of these articles by taking time out during the cut scenes of Ratchet and Clank to read a piece by Elizabeth Harrington of free beacon comm all articles and quotes are non made-up a peer-reviewed article published last year in progress in human geology was entitled glaciers gender and science a feminist Glaciology framework for global environmental change research the article says that while glaciers are quote key icons of climate change the relationships among gender science and glaciers remain under study this paper proposes a feminist Glaciology leading to more just and equitable human ice interactions unquote to be fair this article did improve my personal relationship with ice by causing me to pour a large dollop of whiskey over II another article from dance research journal is called the Pilates pelvis racial implications of the immobile hips this article quote examines the treatment of the pelvis in the Pilates exercises single leg stretch and leg circles which reinforce behaviors of a racially white aesthetic unquote in order to personally check this assertion I watch dozens of videos of scantily clad women stretching their sleek well toned legs open and closed and out there was I talking about oh yes another example of the tragic detritus left behind by the my gender and cultural studies students comes from a publication called men and masculinity z' which features articles by people who seem never to have experienced either one article puts forward the theory that the condition known as impotence or erectile dysfunction is a fiction meant to reinforce quote dominant phallic Radek notions of L female heterosexuality unquote the author asserts that by using feminist analysis she will eliminate the perceived need for an erection I can personally testify that that works like a charm and finally from the Journal SSRN comes the article the lactating man which says quote lactation and breastfeeding are typically viewed as inherently female activities this article questions this gender normativity of milk and argues that male lactation blurs the distinction between male and female as well as perhaps between humans and animals unquote police are still hunting for the author of this article to make sure she doesn't go anywhere near children or men more cows I think these sad documents prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that gender and cultural studies are among the leading causes of ignorance stupidity and madness a call for their complete abolition but I need to laughs trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show
