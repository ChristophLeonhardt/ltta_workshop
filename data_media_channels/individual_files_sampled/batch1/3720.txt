there are many routines that I've adopted but you know if anybody knows me its goal-setting reading before they go I go to sleep and these goals I read every single day are ten goals and seven of them expire in six months and they range from health to professional life to two you know family and friends and then the other three one expires in five years one expires in 10 years and other and 20 I read them every single day so what happens is it's the last thing I read before I went to sleep so I think about it I dream about it and it's the first thing I read when I wake up so I naturally make a call to something I'm talking about or instead of picking up that that a bacon egg and cheese I pick up that one that one protein drink as I said I'm gonna drink one of those a day so that's my ritual goal-setting and then my next ritual is always trying to learn one thing new by the time I go to bed so I walk in the room and I want to be the you know the person who's a sponge and I learned one thing new that's why you know I I don't want to die in the morning time because something I I find out and later on the evening may save my life
