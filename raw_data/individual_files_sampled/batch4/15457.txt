we're here on Burnaby Mountain near Vancouver British Columbia were standing just down the hill from the camp cloud Kinder Morgan protest site I came here last night to do a little recon on the site by myself I drove past and I noticed that there's not actually anybody here in the evenings I drove past repeatedly last night I saw a total of four people and there were about four cars and a couple of bikes in front of the protest camp now this morning when we showed up at 6 a.m. to cover the eviction that never happened this whole street was lined with cars blind protesters the camp was full of people people were coming out of everywhere but now again we've come back after all the Camrys cameras have gone home after all the protesters have gone home and we're discovering that this protest camp is pretty darn astroturf it's empty there aren't a lot of people here I would estimate somewhere between 4 and 10 hippies sleeping in a ditch are holding up the entire Canadian economy and the nation-building project that is the Kinder Morgan trans mountain pipeline expansion for the rebel dot media I'm Sheila Henry it's been a full day waiting around waiting for the Kinder Morgan camp cloud protesters to be evicted hasn't happened yet I'm not sure that it will ever happen but we did do a lot of stories here today and we did put ourselves in some jeopardy now if you want to support our independent journalism and help cover the cost of our trip vote careful and to cover the cost of my bodyguard go to rebel Burnaby eat calm
