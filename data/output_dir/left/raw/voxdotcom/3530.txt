1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,180
When you flip a light switch, you expect it
to work right?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,220
All of your appliances work, because your
power company has electricity ready to transmit.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,820
For a lot of customers.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,720
And utility companies have gotten really good
at anticipating that demand.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,400
But a rise in solar energy production is making
their jobs a bit more complex.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,000
Here's a chart that explains why.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,760
It's showing demand for electricity at any
given time of day.

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,230
The power companies supply the least amount
of power overnight.

9
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,050
Then, it ramps up in the morning.

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,150
Everyone's woken up and business gets going.

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,150
Then at sunset, energy demand peaks.

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,739
Utility companies will update models like
this to operate as efficiently as possible.

13
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,989
But the introduction of renewable energy,
particularly the solar energy, has started

14
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,319
causing problems in these demand curves.

15
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,330
In 2010, solar panel deployment really started
taking off.

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,320
Most of those installations took place in
California, so researchers there started looking

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,840
into it.

18
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,960
They found that the sun produces the most
energy at mid-day.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,159
And when you factor in that new mid-day production,
your demand curve changes like this.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:35,760
Every year means new solar capacity, which
makes mid-day demand dip lower and lower.

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,600
Researchers call this drop in demand the "duck
curve."

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,360
From the grid managers' perspective, the people
whose job it is to constantly balance generation

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,920
and demand, it looks like a drop in demand.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,710
That drop in demand creates two problems.

25
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,640
The first has to do with the intense ramps
in the new chart.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,710
As the sun sets, solar energy production ends
just as the demand for energy typically peaks.

27
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,349
Power plants then have to rapidly ramp up
production to compensate for that.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,400
Which is kind of hard to do with the current
fleet of power infrastructure.

29
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,160
The second problem is economic.

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,560
Say you have a couple of nuclear and coal
plants.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,680
Those plants are only economic when they are
running all the time, basically.

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,879
They run around the clock.

33
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,860
And if you have to turn them off at mid-day,
it completely screws up their economics and

34
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,370
plus lots of utilities just have contracts
with those power plants to keep them running

35
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,370
all the time.

36
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,110
So that creates sort of an artificial floor.

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,719
If solar generates too much power and there's
no use for it, there's no one to consume it,

38
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,730
then grid managers just have to turn some
solar panels off.

39
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,840
If they didn't, we could risk overloading
or even damaging the power grid.

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,500
So we throw away some of that extra solar
energy.

41
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,889
Effectively, what's happening is that solar
power is being wasted.

42
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:13,260
That waste, curtailment, is the big challenge
moving forward for solar energy.

43
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,640
If you want solar, eventually to power everything
or close to everything, you've gotta figure

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,370
out some way of shifting it to the night time.

45
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,609
Cause the sun's down during the night time.

46
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:29,890
The more power that can be stored, the more
you can sort of let solar rip.

47
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,430
While the grid managers figure out how to
serve this new supply and demand, this duck

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,120
is the greatest challenge facing renewable
energy.
