1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,971
The 73rd United Nations General Assembly officially
starts this week and is supposed to be the

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:08,480
place where the key pressing issues of our
time -- the ones that affect people around

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,840
the world --- take center stage.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,790
But as previous years have shown, sometimes
the things that make the headlines during

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,520
the assembly, are not the very issues that
need to be addressed the most.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,840
So we’ve compiled five key global issues
we think you should keep an eye on during

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,430
this General Assembly.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,000
The first is China, where the central government
in Beijing is reportedly imprisoning more

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,340
than a million minority Uyghur muslims in
secret internment camps.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,640
The United Nations says it has received credible
reports that indicate China has been locking

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,690
up the minority group in mass numbers for
months, to politically indoctrinate them,

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,770
in the region of Xinjiang.

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,250
The alleged targeting of this minority group
would make it China’s largest internment

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,210
program since the Era of Mao Zedong.

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,280
The move is reportedly part of a larger effort
by the government to crack down of religious

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,840
liberty in the country.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,240
China vehemently denies that it’s imprisoning
millions of Uyghurs to indoctrinate them,

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,960
despite overwhelming evidence and testimony
from those who were recently released from

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
the camps.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,770
The United Nations and others have condemned
this crackdown, including the United States

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,579
who is now weighing the implementation of
sanctions against the country.

22
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,990
The second is the Rohingya crisis.

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,329
The plight of the Rohingya people now stretches
into its second year.

24
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,219
Myanmar’s alleged state-sponsored violence
against the ethnic and religious minority

25
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,889
group has claimed the lives of at least 10,000
people and forced the over 700,000 others

26
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,359
fleeing across international borders for safety.

27
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,659
A recent report by the United Nations Human
Rights council detailed systematic forms of

28
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:39,009
violence perpetrated by security forces; including
torture, imprisonment, mass rape, arson, and

29
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,689
indiscriminate killing.

30
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:44,289
The group accuses the state of committing
genocide against the Rohingya.

31
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:48,490
Myanmar has refuted these claims, despite
the overwhelming evidence against it, as well

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,099
as victims testimony who have fled the country.

33
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:55,109
This will be the first time world leaders
gather after a UN report called the violence

34
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:57,310
genocide --
Follow this story to see if the world’s

35
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,289
policy makers and leaders push for more action
against the southeast Asian country.

36
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,439
The third is South Sudan’s civil war.

37
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,508
South Sudan, the world’s youngest country,
continues to be afflicted by civil war and

38
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,508
violence.

39
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:14,430
Since 2013, the war has killed well over 50,000
people and created Africa’s worst refugee

40
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,870
crisis today, with more than 2 million people
being forced out of their country to seek

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,040
safety.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,849
South Sudanese not only face the threats of
war, but also a food shortage that could put

43
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,880
over 1 million at risk of severe hunger.

44
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,280
Most recently in August 2018, the warring
sides signed another agreement that seems

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,180
to be holding for the moment.

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,620
But as they wait for the agreement to take
effect, the war continues.

47
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,620
Neighboring countries have accepted millions
who are seeking safety and the UN and other

48
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,709
international organizations have continued
relief efforts.

49
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,180
The United States and european countries have
even placed sanctions and travel restrictions

50
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,400
against key military officers.

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,030
Fourth is the conflict in Yemen.

52
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,950
The conflict has devastated what was already
the poorest country in Arab world.

53
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,190
Over 6,000 civilians have died during the
conflict and 8.4 million others are now on

54
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,980
the brink of starvation.

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,180
The war started as a civil conflict after
popular uprising destabilized the country

56
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
in 2011.

57
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,540
That civil conflict turned into an outright
proxy war between regional archrivals Iran

58
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,549
and Saudi Arabia in 2015, which has created
what some have called “the worst humanitarian

59
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,740
crisis in the world” today.

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,019
Some world powers, like the United States
and United Kingdom have even backed Saudi

61
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,019
Arabia’s brutal campaign.

62
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,909
The United Nations Human Rights Council has
said that both sides in the war need to be

63
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:38,120
investigated for likely war crimes over their
targeting of civilian locations, like hospitals,

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,400
schools, and markets.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,769
So as the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and
the United State’s, all gather on the world

66
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:49,609
stage to send out their messages, listen out
for what they have to say about Yemen.

67
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:52,379
And finally, the U.S. family separation policies.

68
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,709
The United State’s typically takes center
stage at the General Assembly for the president’s

69
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:57,709
speech.

70
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,999
But, this year it will be talked about for
another reason -- its actions that have separated

71
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:05,189
asylum seeker and immigrant families at its
southern border.

72
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:10,590
In April 2018 -- U.S. Attorney General Jeff
Sessions announced a new “zero tolerance

73
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,530
policy” that resulted in the arrest and
criminal prosecution of immigrants who crossed

74
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,320
the border illegally and asylum seekers..

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,900
The policy has even resulted in babies and
toddlers being held inside what some have

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,570
described as “cages.”

77
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,850
While President Trump signed an executive
order in June to end family separations, some

78
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,100
experts say a number of the families that
were separated will never be able to be reunited.

79
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,260
The Trump Administration’s policy has been
criticized by multiple countries, human rights

80
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,970
groups, and political leaders within the United
States.

81
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,640
The United Nations Human Rights Council has
even strongly condemned the U.S. for the separation

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,430
and detention of the families, calling it
“unconscionable” and equating it to child

83
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,630
abuse.

84
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,840
So as the General Assembly gathers, remember
to pay attention to what world leaders will

85
00:04:55,840 --> 00:00:00,000
say, or not say, about some of the most important
world issues of today.
