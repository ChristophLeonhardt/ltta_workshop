so we have Tony Reed here she is in charge of all the Alexa and echo ecosystem of devices and I want to do this real quick raise your hand if you have something with Alexa in it an echo something that's about half 60% so that's you have told me to thank for that I'm so I want to talk a little bit about your background for us before we dive into other stuff you come from an anthropology background you have an anthropology degree and you've been at Amazon for how many years almost 20 almost 20 and now you're with this interesting background you're now running the dominant AI voice-controlled platform talk a little bit about how those two your background meshes with what you're doing now yeah I sort of called my career working on Alexa and AI a little bit accidental I graduated with a degree in anthropology with plans to get my PhD and I ended up working and Technology at Microsoft and then moved over to Amazon and 1998 back when it was mostly a bookstore looks at the time we hadn't launched music yet and so I still very small company it was possible the company being public but it was still very small and you know I'll say a lot of the kind of attributes and the way Amazon are operated then is very similar to help me operate now and I will say that this degree in anthropology has actually given me aligns well with a lot of the values at Amazon so we're very customer obsessed and you'll hear that a lot from employees and and the press but it is something we kind of live day in and day out and this is jeff jesus's thing it is this thing and it's it's something that really level sets and grounds people into the company around really working on the behalf of our customers and so we do that very much for the Alexa we take you know our goal there is around improving the lives of customers adding more convenience in their lives and so if you take that you think about anthropology around this idea of what our customer needs what are the differences and customers and sort of being able to look out on the horizon and understand these differences I think it's actually been an attribute for having this degree in this background versus the technology agree right and those needs are so what are those things what are you finding people you kind of put this thing out there no one especially in my industry we didn't really what is this thing what and then it just took off like a rocket ship what have you guys learned what are the needs that people are getting I know music is huge but what else yeah music is a really large use case for us people love the convenience of being able to play music to multiple providers via their voice but what you know we found two other pieces that were really popular smart home when we first launched we knew we wanted to launch smart home capabilities but we we we launched with it about four months later and customers we thought well this is just an early adopter thing right and and we found that yes that was true but it was really much more it became much more mainstream with Alexa and I think that's because voice made smart home technology even simpler it's now voice enabled you can say turn on my lights turn off my lights and you don't have to go into an app and and that surprised us and then actually surprised us at the usage of smart home and then the number of people buying into smart home devices as well and then you know a third piece that we've been surprised by is the personality people love Alexa's personality and they they love to tell her to hear jokes they say I love you will you marry me what does alexa say when i say will you marry me she's a few different responses one of them I think is thank you I'm flattered but you know and customers asked her opinion about things and so this it was surprising to us that there was really this companionship kind of conversational nature that was going on from very early days and now it makes sense because people have really taken Alexa and it's a part of the family it's really becomes something more its human-like and it kind of fits into the home I really I could tell you my 18 month old nephew he talks to our echo and and he just knows that music comes from that and it's really adorable that he's gonna grow up with that and just know that's happening I mean we actually say that it's interesting to think about we're in a generation where children today will probably not know a home in which they can speak to write and so that that's very new right and it's very natural we saw that with cell phones and kids learning that now it's this whole idea so smart home music today you had an announcements we are going into the office what does that mean yeah so today I think maybe right as we speak at reinvent we've announced Alexa for business and so this is an opportunity for companies of all sizes to take the Alexa experience and integrate it into their workplace and you know we found that customers have loved the experience at home and this is a way to extend that into their workplace so we're really excited about what is what does that look like this that I mean our people so people can play penned or in their office or I mean what's the practical use yeah you imagine kind of two scenarios the the office workplace scenarios that were launching with our communications feature so you can start a meeting I've been testing this and it's it's super delightful so when you go in to start a meeting out you're conferencing system and you can and we've we're working with Polycom and chime or AWS service as well and so when I start a meeting I just say Alexis start the meeting you can end it Alexa end the meeting you can pre-order supplies we've had partners who can build on the Alexa skills kit and they can build their own custom private skills and so they're just internally in there yeah so for example Capital One has taken and built their own skill to get updates on high severity events and so if they have a sub 1 or step to going they can say Alexa what's the update on this and so it's really making it's building the Alexa for business kind of set of api's and then allowing developers in this case some companies to build on top of them and then so speaking of skills that's that's another I think strength of this platform is how many skills are there now third party skills so probably over 25 not over 25,000 so that's that's huge and we see a broad range obviously music and smart home stuff what have you learned from all these third party skills like what works the best on this part we're still learning and it's I will say that they're sort of there's a lot of breath so you will obviously have your top skills where people love them so games trivia games jeopardy jeopardy is one of our most popular really and so people love that kind of family-oriented those are really fun then you have your brand's such as Starbucks uber Domino's Pizza those are delightful skills you can order Starbucks pick it up on your way out order an uber and then you have what I'll call this set of skills that you kind of have to have for everyone and so it's the the tale of skills and we find a lot of people smart home as one news providers or another but we find hobbyist and like niche stuff niche stuff and you know you've and you've got companies such as financial services built you know Capital One what is my bank account status etc so it's the breath is is significant for the usage so to me Alexis seems kind of nebulous it's kind of you have your own devices there's this but there's also this broader ecosystem now we're starting to see it and third-party devices even devices that kind of mimic what you already have with the echo there's this oness one for example how do you guys think about that people kind of glomming onto the platform and just creating these similar devices to you are you okay with that or would you see a future where you guys kind of put a tighter reins around it no we're thrilled with it and why you know our vision is for Alexa to be everywhere customers want her to be and so that will end up in places that we will never build those devices we wouldn't be able to keep up and so for us it's important that the Alexa voice service itself has that distribution and we think these providers can build very delightful experiences and you know the it's sort of whether it's a different use case a completely different segment they will just help build out the experience for Alexa they also can build custom skills to further so like for automotive as an example there's a good example we're not in the automotive right yeah there's no Amazon car yet right okay and so but then they'll you know will start to build new navigation domains etc for those use cases and so not only is the Alexa voice service extended and available to more customers they're more devices but the the developers themselves are building more skills and that makes Alexa even smarter and even more useful for all customers do you think that puts you guys at a greater advantage and say I know Apple kind of delayed their version of their follow up to you their home pod but it seems they're much more restricted what do you what do you think of their position versus your take on just like let's put it in everything yeah I mean I can't speak to sort of their decision-making criteria and why they choose to be more closed I will say that we believe having this be open and having API is available for developers will actually just better serve customers globally so this year you guys had tons of announcements but I think a month or two ago you had your big debut of is there tons of devices I think there was a doorbell thing a camera a answering sir or a phone so the connect to your landline just it seems like everything you can put Alexa and you guys are doing is there anything that you won't put Alexa inside of that's a good question sure yeah I don't know it likes a toilet or something but not yet yeah you know for us there's definitely a prioritization of sort of where we like to spend our time and effort and and some of those you know we look at areas where we think we can improve the experience create convenience simplify the lives of customers we'll look at the size of that usage or a segment size and so that's really what goes into our prioritization but sure there are also things that I'd love to do that just you know not quite above the line right for us so and so this the slew of products I think the last one that was called the spot is coming out in a couple weeks and I think that's it for the end of the year you have so many is the idea like let's get all these out there and see what works and like maybe some of these drop off a year from now or are you guys confident that this suite of products you've made will actually they will all take off I I mean I'm confident they're all going to do really well and so that doesn't mean that we know for sure that every product we bill will be a four-star product and and be successful for the echo device line that's actually we've seen success repeatedly with the products that we've launched I think echo spot is an spot from people who don't know what is that it's a it says so the I'll start with the echo show is a larger device with a screen that we launched the summer echo spot is the second device with the screen that's a circular two and a half inch diameter screen and the I'm I'm very excited about this product because it's this great compact form factor that you can sprinkle throughout your home I have one at my at work on my desk and it's super delightful I have one in my bedroom and and so you know the screen is actually a way to supplement and kind of augment the experience from a voice perspective and so we can add supplementary information on this screen and so I think customers are really going to enjoy echo spot so this year we saw an expansion it we are familiar with the echo speakers no screen no cameras now we're getting into that there's even a version of Amazon camera that checks your fashion choices in your bedroom so we have Amazon microphones Amazon cameras Amazon screens you can tell where I'm going with this why should we feel safe having these devices in our house I could talk about it in two ways one we start very much from the customer work backwards and we keep privacy in mind from the beginning of the build when we think about this and echo is a great example of that where we built in a lot of customer controls and transparencies so you can mute the device we when you speak to echo it has a blue LED it shows you that it's streaming audio to the cloud you can actually turn on an audible noise and your comms are a time that allows you to hear when it's dreamy when you meet the device it's disconnected electronically so there's no software that can override that we have customers control and the app where you can go through it like at your voice history you can see what has been said to Alexa which is fun by the way if you go and see what your family members are saying - every time I do it when I'm traveling yeah you can delete those recordings you can delete all of the recordings and so for us it's very important to give customers transparency and control and help them understand why we're collecting this information and and and you know why you have a camera it will always have a customer benefit so talk about that so that's the voice of the thing aspect of it what the camera aspect of it similar in the case that in the case of the camera it is there today to detect presence and so when you walk into a room it can detect that you're there and the screen will come on when you're not there the screen goes off and it's also there for communication features so we have video call right video chatting and video chatting and so it has a use case you can also disable that with a click of a button as well ok so you've built this massive platform already and it's been how many years since the first echo 3 3 and we had Scott Galloway here from NYU talking about thinking by his estimate you have about 70% of this market which it's relatively a small market but you've left ahead of Google you're ahead of Google you're head of Apple how do you think about the responsibilities that go with that platform we've seen Google struggle with this with their search platform favouring Google services over other stuff how do you make sure when someone is let's say shopping through the app or through Alexa that's they're not only getting like Amazon branded products if I say I want batteries I'm getting maybe Duracell instead of the Amazon version of batteries how do you guys play around with that and the responsibility that comes with this platform this growing platform yeah I I'm in the case of the shopping example we will return something similar to what you would get on Amazon search results and there that will be bestseller so whether it's an Amazon basics brand which in the case of batteries I think is a great product great reviews and very low prices but it can also be any other brand it also is weighed with your past purchase history and so something that you've purchased before and you know the reason why this is actually really hard with voice and shopping is that when you're trying to order or shop via voice you don't necessarily customers don't want to hear a long list of products that come back you really want to give them one choice maybe two you want to get it right that first time and so you know we it's it's a very much based on sort of amazon's customer first first approach if i am building a shopping app am i allowed to have a shopping skill as a third party outside of amazon on alexa meaning if you're maybe your reiative if i'm let's say Target or Walmart so we have Best Buy yeah Best Buy has a skill that with you guys absolutely you know take look at the music experience and so it was on yeah so Amazon has prime music and Amazon music unlimited but we also have Pandora Spotify and others and so for us it's important to bring customers choice and selection with with the services that we offer so we have a lot of marketers in the audience can you talk a little bit about how people might want to market or make money through the Alexa platform whether it's through ad sells or maybe native advertising and a and a new segment or something like that is that on the out on the platform and what are you seeing there so advertising today what we what you have today is in content that's streamed on the device so music video news providers their advertising has included just which is consistent with what you would experience when you're listening to that content on a mobile device or or somewhere else beyond that from a pure advertising perspective it's something that we want to think really hard about because it's it can be distracting from a customer experience perspective and it's something that we want to be very thoughtful about creating a new experience from an advertising perspective and a primary in this case in a primarily voice based experience but then we also have ways for developers and companies to make money through the you know we have a paid subscription an upsell program so we just launched about a month ago with jeopardy the ability to upsell to double jeopardy so it's a Content pack and and you can add up for $0.99 or free with Prime and so we're starting to get kind of that I actually don't know and so for us it's a brown driving monetization that drives a direct customer benefit as well and that will also teach us how customers will use us and what will be acceptable and what is a good user experience and you know we have other ways that developers can make money as well where we pay them from a paid engagement perspective if they have a skill that drives high engagement we have AWS credits etc and so we've got a bunch of pieces that were experimenting with and that we've been rolling now so last thing Alexa's going global I think how many countries know about Australia yeah so we just announced Australia last night we're in India Japan Canada which is releasing soon UK Germany US and how does that work how does besides a language obviously and how is the Alexus experience different in those countries versus what we're seeing right now in the US yeah I so it's fully localized so we take the Alexa core experience and personality and a lot of those things stay true and we localize and so we have a local voice that has a local accent we localize skills we have a robust set of data and knowledge that we have to start understanding this personality go into that to you talk it does it does and so you know her personality doesn't radically change is really the same everywhere but you know there's a localized piece to it so if you ask her favorite you know an opinion or her favorites it will change you know in different countries and so we do spend a lot of time on fine-tuning what that localized experience would be you know part of is we have to understand the language and then we have to be able to respond back in that language for the proper accents and so each of these are fully localized so when is Alexa fully global how long oh I don't know that's a tough question years months years I mean this is something we'd love to go faster but we want to do it the right way we want customers in each of these countries to love the experience and so for us it's a you know you have to balance the the speed at which you can do that with really having a delightful experience
