VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS IN JEOPARDY. JOINING US NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI. MR. MAYOR, BEFORE YOU TOOK ON THIS POSITION YOU HAD ON THIS PROGRAM IDENTIFIED CRIMES. I THINK IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY RELEVANT HOW THE YOU WERE ECHELON IN THE FBI TREATED HILLARY CLINTON SO SHE COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT BEING INDICTED AS A CANDIDATE. AND HOW THEY HAVE TREATED DONALD TRUMP AND I DO BELIEVE THIS IMPACTS WHETHER OR NOT THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION AT ITS FOUNDATION, CONSIDERING IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE INVOLVED NOW SHOULD ALL GO AWAY AS A RESULT. I WAS ON YOUR SHOW ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF WE IDENTIFIED I THINK IT WAS 18 VIOLATION OF THE LAW BY HEATHER PICK ABLE TO PROVE AND IT'S DISGRACEFUL. WE ARE WAY BEYOND HILLARY CLINTON. WE HAVE INVESTIGATION IN THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HAS BEEN A FIX, A FRAME-UP AND A WITCH-HUNT. IT WAS LED BY PETER STRZOK, WHO IT IS DISGRACEFUL AND EVEN FOR THE PRESENT DIRECTOR OF THE FBI TO HAVE HIM THERE TOMORROW WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL. EVERY FBI AGENT SHOULD DEMAND THAT THAT MAN BE FIRED AND TOMORROW MUELLER SHOULD SUSPEND HIS INVESTIGATION AND THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS WHO SHOULD NOW STEP UP BIG TIME TO SAVE HIS DEPARTMENT SHOULD SUSPEND THAT INVESTIGATION. THROW OUT ALL THE PEOPLE IS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE PHONY TRUMP INVESTIGATION AND BRING IN HONEST FBI AGENTS FROM THE NEW YORK OFFICE WHO I COULD TRUST IMPLICITLY AND THEY SHOULD TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO COMEY, STRZOK, PAGE, ALL THOSE FBI AGENTS WHO TOOK GIFTS GIFTS, SEAN? THAT IS CALLED BRIBERY WHERE I COME FROM. THEY TOOK TICKETS THEY PUT GOVERNOR MCDONALD TO JAIL. THE ANGRY DEMOCRATS WHO WERE WORKING FOR MUELLER. THEY PUT GOVERNOR MCDAMAGED ON JAIL FOR TAKING A COUPLE LITTLE TRINKETS, FBI AGENTS SELLING OUT AND LEAKING LIKE SOIFS AND STATEMENT OF STRZOK HE IS PUT IN CHARGE THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. THE GUY AHEAD OF THIS RICCO CASE IS JIM COMEY HE CREATED THIS ATMOSPHERE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. HE WAS THE REASON STRZOK AND PAGE WAS ABLE TO OPERATE. THOSE GUYS ARE TAKING TICKETS? FBI AGENTS SHOULD BE INFURIATED BY THAT I'M INFURIATED BECAUSE I LOVE THE FBI. THESE PEOPLE DON'T LOVE THE FBI. I DO. Sean: I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PERSON PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THIS IS NOT THE RANK AND FILE. THIS WAS LITERALLY RIPPED OUT OF THE HANDS OF RANK AND FILE. BROUGHT INTO THE SEVENTH FLOOR. THE YOU WERE ECHELON OF THE FBI. I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HERE IS ESPECIALLY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND THE PRESIDENT'S PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU TREAT ONE CANDIDATE ONE WAY AND YOU LITERALLY HAVE CRIMES AND THE EVIDENCE IS INCONVO VERT TILLABLE. I NEVER SAW A BETTER CASE FOR OBSTRUCTION THAN HILLARY DID FOR DELETING EMAILS, ACID WASHING AND BREAKING UP DEVICES. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TREAT HER THAT WAY. AND YOU LOOK AT THE BULLY TACTICS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER BY WEISSMANN AND BEGINNING STRZOK AND TEAM MUELLER PUT TOGETHER, HOW COULD ANY AMERICAN AT THIS POINT ENTIRE CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. I THINK, SEAN, I FEEL THAT THIS WHOLE THING HAS MADE FOOLS OF ALL OF US. I MEAN, THEY THINK WE ARE IDIOTS. WE SUPPLIED 1.4 MILLION DOCUMENTS. WE SUPPLIED 32 WITNESSES. NO PRIVILEGE ARGUMENTS. AND WHO ARE WE SUPPLYING THEM TO? PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY CONCLUDED TO FRAME DONALD TRUMP AGENTS WHO STARTED A PHONY RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. THIS. THAT'S WHY THE INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE SUSPENDED. AND I AM TALKING FOR MYSELF NOW, NOT THE PRESIDENT. BUT I BELIEVE HE WOULD AGREE WITH THIS. VERY SERIOUS INVESTIGATION HAS TO BE DONE OF THE FBI AGENTS AT THE VERY TOP BY FBI AGENTS WHO ARE HONEST. IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE THEM. HATRED THEY HAVE FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S ALL THERE IN BLACK AND WHITE. THAT'S POLITICAL. WHY DID HOROWITZ SAY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS WHEN IT'S ALL OVER HIS DOCUMENT? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOROWITZ CONCLUDED. DIRECTOR CONCLUDED. I'M BEYOND THAT I THINK ALL THE ATTENTION NOW SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON LET'S GET A FAIR INVESTIGATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO CORRUPTED THAT INVESTIGATION HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THE CORRUPT INVESTIGATION FROM THE BEGINNING. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO ME. DID I NOTHING WRONG. HOW COULD THIS BE? NOW WE KNOW HOW IT IS. BECAUSE, THESE PEOPLE FIXED IT THAT'S HOW IT IS. PLEASE, AMERICAN PEOPLE. READ THIS. IF YOU ARE NOT DISGUSTED, AND YOU DON'T DEMAND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BEGIN THIS INVESTIGATION AND TO SPEND THE ONE OF THE PRESIDENT AND ALL THE PEOPLE TORTURED BY IT, THEN I DON'T THINK WE HAVE JUSTICE ANYMORE IN THIS COUNTRY. Shepard: LAST POINT. ROD ROSENSTEIN, WE NOW KNOW IN MEETINGS, HAS THREATENED TO SUBPOENA EMAILS, INTIMIDATE, HARASSING CONGRESSMAN AND THEIR STAFFS WHO HAVE BEEN TASKED CONSTITUTIONALLY WITH THE DUTY OF OVERSIGHT. YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE THREATS HE IS THE GUY THAT SIGNED THE LAST FISA WARRANT KNOWING THAT THE BULK OF INFORMATION PHONY CLINTON PAID FOR DOSSIER AND HE IS THE GUY WHO RECOMMENDED FIRING COMEY. IS HE CONFLICTED. INTIMIDATING AND THREATENING TO USE THE POWER OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AGAINST CONGRESSMAN AND THEIR STAFFS, WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT? TO ME IT SOUNDS LIKE OBSTRUCTION. YEAH. IT'S A LOT CLEARER OBSTRUCTION THAN FIRING COMEY ON HIS RECOMMENDATION, WHICH IS NOT OBSTRUCTION. IT'S WITHIN THE PRESIDENT'S ARTICLE 2 POWERS. SO I BELIEVE THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN AND JEFF SESSIONS HAVE A CHANCE TO REDEEM THEMSELVES. THAT CHANCE COMES ABOUT TOMORROW. IT DOESN'T GO BEYOND TOMORROW. TOMORROW MUELLER SHOULD BE SUSPENDED AND HONEST PEOPLE SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN, IMPARTIAL PEOPLE TO INVESTIGATE THESE PEOPLE LIKE STRZOK. STRZOK SHOULD BE IN JAIL BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK. Sean: ALL RIGHT. MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU. WE WILL FOLLOW THIS STORY. LET'S SEE IF HE
