let me introduce you to Houston Texas student Hanaa diab dawn she looks sweet until you get to tweets like god bless hamas and inshallah they torture an Israeli soldier slowly and posted on YouTube so we can watch let's take a look so there are some pro Palestinian students who want a two-state solution but then there are others who either want the entire State of Israel for Muslims or support terrorism against their political opponents like annatee he or she is wishing for a video feed of an Israeli soldiers torture or set him on fire that's nice too he or she is hoping for more missiles fired on Israel but this is an only hatred for a nation no Haddad II also seems to hate the people living there for their religion she first shows that she doesn't have too strong of a grasp on history or international affairs when she says the Holocaust was a dark time for the Jews I admit very inhuman but what the Jews are now doing to Palestinians is even worse she also says may Allah curse the Jews lol let me blow up this bin Jew please everyone report this account he's a Jew you know it's odd how often these people use the term yahoodi instead of Jew it might be an attempt to avoid some kind of Twitter hate speech algorithm though I wouldn't be surprised at Twitter allows hatred of Jewish people as long as you're from the right side of the spectrum that is the left side and as with most lefties Hinata's contempt extends to other deplorable groups like whites she says I better not be seeing you racist ass white people smoking hookah listening to rap music or eating any food besides plain bread and canned peas of course not because that would be cultural appropriation I assume when another user posted screenshots of a girl being an ungrateful brat after receiving expensive Christmas gifts hanadi said she's white what did y'all expect can you imagine that being said about any other racial group it's precisely this kind of false attribution of negative qualities to whole groups of people that legitimizes violence against those people you can stop being mean but it's a bit harder stop being white or Jewish things can get pretty deadly when identity and personality are one in the same in the eyes of a political faction that controls Hollywood the media and academia conadi said she moved to Canada if Trump wins I am guessing she lived up to that promise just as much as celebrities did but one summer she posted I'm currently in Saudi and I swear I've encountered and witnessed more racism than I ever have in America imagine a Muslim country - yes hanadi it's almost like Islamist countries that have only just now made it legal for women to drive aren't the most tolerant places for campus unmasked I'm Rob Shimshon if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
