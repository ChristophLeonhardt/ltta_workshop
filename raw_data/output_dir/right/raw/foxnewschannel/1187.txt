1
00:00:00,077 --> 00:00:01,846
DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT JOHNSON

2
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:02,980
SHOULD RESIGN?

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,115
SOMEONE SHOULD ASK YOU THE

4
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:05,449
QUESTION BECAUSE OF WAY YOU

5
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:06,284
FORMULATE THE QUESTION.

6
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:06,851
>> Martha: INTERESTING

7
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:08,486
QUESTIONS ON BOTH SIDE.

25
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:36,681
YOU BOTH HAVE A LOT OF

26
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:42,153
EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA.

27
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:43,220
LANNY, DOES PRESIDENT CLINTON

28
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,790
NEED A NEW ANSWER TO THAT

29
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,857
QUESTION NOW?

30
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:48,059
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE ONE

31
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,695
COMMENT ON THIS TOPIC.

32
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:52,530
PRESIDENT CLINTON APOLOGIZED

33
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,765
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

34
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:55,399
PUBLICLY.

35
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,235
HE APOLOGIZED TO MISS LEWINSKY

36
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:02,206
AND HER FAMILY PUBK --

37
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:03,541
PUBLICLY AND HE APOLOGIZEDDED

38
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,542
TO HIS WIFE AND FAMILY.

39
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,911
BY THE TIME HE LEFT OFFICE THE

40
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:08,112
AMERICAN'S PEOPLE JUDGMENT WAS

41
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:09,347
65% APPROVAL RATING.

42
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:12,216
THE HIGHEST OF ANY SECOND TERM

43
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:14,185
PRESIDENT SINCE POLLS WERE

44
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:14,552
INVENTED.

45
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:16,287
THAT IS ABOUT ALL I WANT TO

46
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,756
SAY ABOUT THAT TOPIC.

47
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:19,990
>> Martha: UNDERSTOOD.

48
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,192
DAVID, LET ME GET YOUR

49
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,193
RESPONSE TO THIS.

50
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,861
IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO THE

51
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:25,229
PART THAT HE SAYS I LEFT THE

52
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,064
WHITE HOUSE $16 MILLION IN

53
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:27,431
DEBT.

54
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,735
DON TRUMP JUNIOR TWEETED ABOUT

55
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,570
THAT TODAY.

56
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,606
HE SAID, "DID BILL CLINTON

57
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:38,376
JUST #MeToo MONICA LEWINSKY?

58
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:49,286
THE FIRST MALE TO CLAIM VICTIM

59
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:49,787
VICTIMHOOD."

60
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:50,187
DAVID?

61
00:01:50,187 --> 00:01:51,122
>> HE IS THE VICTIM HERE.

62
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:52,390
HE IS THE VICTIM AS THE

63
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,624
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

64
00:01:53,624 --> 00:01:56,694
WHO USED HIS POSITION OF POWER

65
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:59,296
OVER A 20-YEAR-OLD INTERN.

66
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,765
HE IS THE VICTIM AFTER ALL

67
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:01,399
THESE YEARS.

68
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,633
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

69
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,835
BILL CLINTON ONLY, BILL

70
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,337
CLINTON ONLY ADMITTED THE

71
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,906
TRUTH WHICH WAS THAT HE HAD AN

72
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:11,375
AFFAIR WITH MONICA LEWINSKY

73
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,343
ONLY BECAUSE THE SPECIAL

74
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:13,711
PROSECUTOR GOT A SUBPOENA TO

75
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,513
DRAW HIS BLOOD TO FORCE HIM TO

76
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,448
ADMIT THAT HE LEFT PHYSICAL

77
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:20,618
EVIDENCE ON A BLUE DRESS.

78
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,119
THAT IS HOW DISGUSTING THE

79
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:24,121
FACTS WERE THAT WE HAD TO DEAL

80
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,623
WITH IN THE '90s.

81
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,925
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF THE

82
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,160
BROADER INVESTIGATION, AT THE

83
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,861
TIME YOU FOUGHT VERY HARD

84
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:31,862
AGAINST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL

85
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:32,463
KEN STARR.

86
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,697
YOU SAID HE WAS OUT OF

87
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:34,298
CONTROL.

88
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,134
THAT THERE WASN'T A SCINTILLA

89
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:38,102
OF EVIDENCE AGAINST BILL

90
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:42,306
CLINTON IN THE PAULA JONES

91
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:45,743
CASE AND NOW OTHERS ARE

92
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:46,944
CONCERN AND SAYING I LIVED

93
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:48,078
THROUGH THIS AND IT IS WRONG

94
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:49,313
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING AGAIN.

95
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,682
DO YOU AGREE WITH MARK PENN?

96
00:02:51,682 --> 00:02:52,716
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE

97
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:53,050
SAID.

98
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,885
HE IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

99
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:55,719
>> Martha: HE HAS WRITTEN

100
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,588
FIVE OR SIX COLUMNS THAT SAYS

101
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:58,756
HE THINKS THE INVESTIGATION IS

102
00:02:58,756 --> 00:02:59,523
OUT OF CONTROL.

103
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:01,459
>> I JUST SAID I HAVE NO IDEA

104
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:02,259
WHAT MARK PENN SAID.

105
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,861
HE IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

106
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:05,029
THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN

107
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:09,533
GOING ON FOR ONE YEAR.

108
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,068
AT ONE YEAR INTO WATERGATE,

109
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,670
PRESIDENT NIXON SAID ONE YEAR

110
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,337
IS ENOUGH.

111
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:14,538
LET'S CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION.

112
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:16,807
ONE YEAR LATER HE RESIGNED.

113
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:20,077
I THINK MR. MUELLER IS HIGHLY

114
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:20,444
RESPECTED.

115
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:22,146
TREY GOWDY I NEVER THOUGHT I'D

116
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:24,181
QUOTE, DAVID, IN PRAISE AFTER

117
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,550
WHAT HE DID ON BENGHAZI.

118
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,052
TREY GOWDY HAS TOLD PRESIDENT

119
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:29,153
TRUMP THE FOLLOWING --

120
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:31,021
"IF YOU ARE NOT GUILTY, THEN

121
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,423
ACT LIKE IT."

122
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:35,059
SO LET'S LET MR. MUELLER DO

123
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:35,493
HIS JOB.

124
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,061
>> LET ME CORRECT YOU ON ONE

125
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:37,361
THING.

126
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,529
THAT IS THAT THIS

127
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:39,663
INVESTIGATION WILL HAVE BEEN

128
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:41,999
GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS THIS

129
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,333
AUGUST.

130
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:42,967
TWO YEARS.

131
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:44,335
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE

132
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:46,103
STARTED THEIR INVESTIGATIONS

133
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:47,738
IN AUGUST OF '16.

134
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:49,073
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT.

135
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:50,674
YES, MUELLER HAS BEEN IN

136
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:51,842
OFFICE JUST OVER A YEAR.

137
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:52,776
BUT THIS INVESTIGATION HAS

138
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:55,446
BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS.

139
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:56,480
>> ONE YEAR.

140
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,781
>> IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO

141
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,383
YEARS AND THERE HAS BEEN NO

142
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,684
EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF ANY

143
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:01,118
COLLUSION.

144
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:02,520
THAT IS WHAT THIS

145
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,621
INVESTIGATION WAS ABOUT.

146
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,623
THIS WASN'T ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

147
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:07,091
PAUL MANAFORT AND WHAT HE DID

148
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,826
TEN YEARS AGO.

149
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,528
EVEN THOUGH HE IS GOING TO BE

150
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:11,862
CONVICTED IT LOOKS LIKE ON

151
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:12,463
OTHER ISSUES.

152
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:13,898
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

153
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:15,499
PRESIDENT AND THE CAMPAIGN'S

154
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:15,866
COLLUSION.

155
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,267
THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S POINT.

156
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,303
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

157
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:21,171
>> Martha: ALSO JUST TO --

158
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:22,673
THAT WAS AN INTERVIEW I DID

159
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:23,274
WITH TREY GOWDY.

160
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:24,275
THE PART THAT DOESN'T GET

161
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,976
PICKED UP A LOT IS HE SAID I

162
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:26,977
DON'T THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP

163
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:28,279
DID ANYTHING WRONG.

164
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,380
HE SAID FROM EVERYTHING WE ARE

165
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,981
SEEING THERE IS NO INDICATION

166
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:34,084
THAT HE DID ANYTHING WRONG.

167
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,553
>> I DON'T THINK IS CERTAINLY

168
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:36,554
FAIR BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN

169
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:37,621
THE FACTS YET.

170
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:38,389
MY FRIEND DAVID --

171
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,823
>> Martha: YOU SAY HE SHOULD

172
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:40,658
BE IMPEACHED.

173
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:41,425
WAIT A MINUTE.

174
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,295
YOU SAID HE SHOULD BE

175
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:44,728
IMPEACHED.

176
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:45,529
>> WHO SAID THAT?

177
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:46,764
>> Martha: YOU JUST SAID IN

178
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:47,765
THE LAST BREATH YOU DON'T

179
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,333
THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

180
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,168
>> WHO SAID HE SHOULD BE

181
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:51,535
IMPEACHED?

182
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:52,536
I DID NOT SAY THAT.

183
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:53,404
>> Martha: YOU HAVE SAID

184
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:53,904
THAT.

185
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:55,005
>> I SAID HE SHOULD BE

186
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:55,439
INVESTIGATED.

187
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,007
I DON'T KNOW IF HE SHOULD BE

188
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:57,374
IMPEACHED.

189
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:59,009
MY BOOK, THANK YOU FOR

190
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,544
MENTIONING, MARTHA, CALLS FOR

191
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:01,512
AN INVESTIGATION.

192
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,080
AND MY FRIEND DAVID, WE HAVE

193
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,281
BECOME FRIENDS OVER THE YEARS

194
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:05,816
FORGOT TO MENTION THAT KEN

195
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:07,251
STARR INVESTIGATED BILL

196
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:08,519
CLINTON AND MRS. CLINTON FOR

197
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,221
SEVEN YEARS AND $60 MILLION.

198
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:13,857
BACK THEN DAVID WASN'T

199
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:16,493
COMPLAINING.

200
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:17,628
>> THAT IS BECAUSE BILL

201
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:18,562
CLINTON HAD ONE PROBLEM AFTER

202
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:18,896
ANOTHER.

203
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,331
ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT

204
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:21,265
ADMINISTRATIONS WE EVER SAW.

205
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:22,733
LOOK AT HOW MANY INDEPENDENT

206
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,567
COUNSELS THERE WERE.

207
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,835
LOOK AT HOW MANY DIFFERENT

208
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:25,836
INVESTIGATIONS THERE WERE.

209
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:26,971
THERE WERE CORRUPTION AT EVERY

210
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:27,338
TURN.

211
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,773
THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION, YOU

212
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:31,241
KNOW, LOOKING FOR SOME FACTS.

213
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,677
BUT THERE IS NONE THERE.

214
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:34,979
THAT HAS BEEN THE PRESIDENT'S

215
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,413
POINT THE ENTIRE TIME.

216
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:37,581
>> Martha: LET ME --

217
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:39,083
>> LET'S WAIT FOR THE FACTS TO

218
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:39,917
COME OUT.

219
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,018
THE LAST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL

220
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:43,621
AFTER MR. STARR FOUND NO

221
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:45,122
EVIDENCE OF ANY CRIMINAL

222
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:46,924
WRONGDOING BY EITHER

223
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:47,825
MRS. CLINTON DESPITE ALL OF

224
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,426
YOUR EFFORTS, ENDED UP IN A

225
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:50,260
BIG ZERO.

226
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,828
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.

227
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,296
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT JAMES

228
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:54,164
COMEY BECAUSE I KNOW IN YOUR

229
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,666
BOOK "THE UNMAKING OF THE

230
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,934
PRESIDENT 2016."

231
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,402
BY THAT YOU MEAN HILLARY

232
00:05:58,402 --> 00:05:58,769
CLINTON.

233
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:00,037
YOU BELIEVE JAMES COMEY'S

234
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:01,538
ACTIONS TOWARD THE END OF THE

235
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:04,208
CAMPAIGN LITERALLY UNMADE HER

236
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,043
OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESIDENT.

237
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:07,745
YOU BELIEVE HE LIED.

238
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,413
HOW SO?

239
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,081
>> WELL, THIS IS WHERE AGAIN,

240
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:13,751
DAVID AND I MAY ACTUALLY AGREE

241
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:14,418
ON SOMETHING.

242
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:17,421
COMEY LIED WHEN HE SAID HE WAS

243
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,789
OBLIGATED TO SHOW THE CONGRESS

244
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,524
THAT HE WAS INVESTIGATING THE

245
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:21,825
E-MAILS BECAUSE OF WHAT HE

246
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:22,526
TESTIFIED TO.

247
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,094
WHEN ALL HE ACTUALLY SAID AND

248
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,262
HE KNOWS THAT THIS IS ALL HE

249
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:26,830
SAID IS I WILL LOOK AT.

250
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,565
WHEN HE FINALLY LOOKED AT SIX

251
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:30,534
DAYS LATER AS WE ALL KNOW AS A

252
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,302
MATTER OF HISTORY, HE FOUND

253
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:33,203
NOTHING THERE.

254
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,672
ON NOVEMBER 6, TWO DAYS BEFORE

255
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:36,073
THE ELECTION HE TOLD US THERE

256
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:36,774
WAS NOTHING THERE.

257
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:38,375
I ALSO AGREE THAT HE SHOULD

258
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,611
HAVE BEEN FIRED.

259
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,979
BUT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA,

260
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,614
BECAUSE HE VIOLATED JUSTICE

261
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:46,383
DEPARTMENT FUNDAMENTAL RULES.

262
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:47,718
I DON'T AGREE WITH PRESIDENT

263
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:48,919
TRUMP'S REASON FOR FIRING BUT

264
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,020
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED.

265
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,587
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT.

266
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:51,855
JUST TO BE CLEAR, AT THIS

267
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:53,257
POINT YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

268
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:55,626
THERE SHOULD BE IMPEACHMENT

269
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,627
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PRESIDENT

270
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:56,994
TRUMP?

271
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:57,528
>> NOT WITHOUT AN

272
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:57,961
INVESTIGATION.

273
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:59,229
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE FACTS

274
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,433
ARE AFTER A THUR

275
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,600
REINVESTIGATION -- THOROUGH

276
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,034
INVESTIGATION.

277
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:06,070
I'D LIKE IT TO BE BIPARTISAN

278
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,671
JUDGMENT RATHER THAN PARTISAN

279
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,406
ONE WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED TO

280
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:10,741
BILL CLINTON IN 1998.

281
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:11,775
>> THAT IS WHY WE NEED

282
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:12,676
REPUBLICANS TO KEEP CONTROL OF

283
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:13,644
THE HOUSE BECAUSE THAT IS THE

284
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:15,012
ONLY WAY THERE WON'T BE

285
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:15,412
IMPEACHMENT.

286
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:16,747
THE DEMOCRAT HAVE NO POLICY

287
00:07:16,747 --> 00:07:18,382
POSITION, NO AGENDA OTHER THAN

288
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:20,484
TO IMPEACH THIS PRESIDENT, TO

289
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,885
END HIS REMARKABLE AGENDA AND

290
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:23,220
HIS SUCCESSES.

291
00:07:23,220 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Martha: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
