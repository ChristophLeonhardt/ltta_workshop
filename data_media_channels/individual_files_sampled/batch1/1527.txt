these are some of the girls rescued from what police say was forced prostitution their home in northern India had been a charitable shelter for children without stable families but last year its owners lost their license the shelter should have closed it didn't instead say police its owners kept girls captive renting them out for sex we conducted raids at three or four places in two hours and rescued nearly 24 girls and we are still looking for 15 more children police found out about what was going on when one girl escaped she ran to a nearby police station and described how the woman running the home kept children captive she used to say that they would kill us she used to threaten us she took children to the office once and told us to hit policemen or media it became children being forced into prostitution is relatively common in India the government's National Commission for the protection of child rights says care homes often hide it about a quarter of a million children live in one of 7,000 of them of which 1/5 are unregistered with little official oversight when sexual violence is exposed the associated criminal cases are often poorly prosecuted first of all investigations are not done in the manner that they really established the case in the court because cooking of the court most of the cases are not able to stand and then second thing is the time taken in the cases so witness turns hostile there is no proof there is no everything gets lost by the time the case really comes to final level of here make sure my protests about women's safety are growing the issue of children's safety is increasingly wrapped up in those the police here are keen to show that they are exposing and ending child sexual abuse but the truth in this case is that they got lucky one girl escaped advocates for children say the authorities need to be much more active in finding and then properly prosecuting those who exploit children one rescue does little to address a chronic nationwide problem Andrew Thomas al-jazeera Deli
