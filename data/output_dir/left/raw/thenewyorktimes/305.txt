1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,790
Over the course of just eight days,
a kind of mini world war

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,640
played out inside Syria.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,250
Conflict intensified,

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,470
involving major players
like the U.S., Russia,

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,890
Turkey, Israel and Iran.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,220
Kurds, rebel groups,
and forces loyal to Syrian leader

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,010
Bashar al-Assad also got involved.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,170
Here’s how one of the
most chaotic weeks

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,440
in the Syrian war unfolded.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,230
Saturday, Feb. 3.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,570
A Russian airplane is shot
down over Idlib province,

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,870
apparently by anti-Assad rebels.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,720
Sunday, Feb. 4.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,790
Pro-Assad forces
bomb the same province.

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,770
A suspected chemical
attack is reported

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,900
by doctors in rural Idlib.

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,000
Rebels blame the Syrian regime.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,000
Monday, Feb. 5.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,990
Russians launch airstrikes
targeting Eastern Ghouta,

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,790
a rebel held area near
the capital, Damascus,

21
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,870
leaving more than 100 dead
over the next several days.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,670
Tuesday, Feb. 6.

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,830
The U.N. calls for a cease-fire,

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,830
saying Syria faces
an “extreme” humanitarian crisis.

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,840
Syrians say Israeli warplanes
fired missiles near Damascus.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,150
Fighting continues between
Turks and Kurds

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,220
in the Kurdish majority region of Afrin.

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,150
And Turkey restates that from there,

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,810
it will push 80 miles
further into Manbij,

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,010
a Kurdish-held city
with a U.S. military presence.

31
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,160
Wednesday, Feb. 7.

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,520
Top U.S. generals visit an
American base near Manbij,

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,350
in what was seen
as a direct message

34
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,920
to Turkey, a NATO ally,
to keep its distance.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,590
Pro-Assad forces attack
U.S.-backed fighters

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,000
in Eastern Syria.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,300
The U.S. launches a rare
air assault in response.

38
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,540
At least 100
pro-Assad troops,

39
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,390
including Russian mercenaries,

40
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,740
are presumed dead.

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,920
Thursday, Feb. 8.

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,970
Rebels and civilians continue
to suffer

43
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,300
withering air assaults
in Eastern Ghouta.

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,560
Some of the worst
of the seven-year civil war.

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,380
Saturday, Feb. 10.

46
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,140
An Israeli F-16 crashes
in northern Israel,

47
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,360
after coming under heavy
fire by the Syrian military.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,810
Israel said it had shot
down an Iranian drone that

49
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,560
entered its airspace after
being launched from Syria.

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,040
A Turkish helicopter is also
shot down by Kurdish fighters.

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,520
Two pilots are killed and seven
other Turks die in fighting.

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,260
It’s the highest
one day death toll

53
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,930
since the Turkish
incursion in Syria.

54
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,940
All of this played out
against the backdrop

55
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,850
of the continuing U.S.
mission to defeat ISIS —

56
00:02:27,850 --> 00:00:00,000
a fight that remains ongoing,
even as other conflicts arise.
