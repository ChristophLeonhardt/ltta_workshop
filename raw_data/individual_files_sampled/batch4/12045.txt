Oh to bring your attention to a couple of things here first we have the popular health information website health line which I think it's like 80 million visitors a month or something along those lines and it has a safe sex guide which is supposed to guide you in the ways of having safe sex but in that guide it has introduced a new term which is supposed to take the place of an old term and I want to read a bit of this guide to you okay this is what it said these guides talking about other safe sex guides these guides often unnecessarily gender body parts as being male parts and female parts and refer to sex with women or sex with men excluding those who identify as non-binary now just a second here you notice how they use the word gender as a verb this is very common these days you hear people say gender like it's a verb like it's something that you do but it's not a verb okay gender is not a verb you can't gender something it's not something that you can do to a thing if you go out for the day and you come home and somebody says what were you doing today it wouldn't make any sense for you to say oh I was out gendering you know I was doing a bit of gendering that's all just gendering did a little gendering here little gendering there that that doesn't make any sense it's not a verb stop it stop it many individuals don't see body parts as having a gender people have a gender what body parts don't have a gender because people have a gender but people have body parts don't they what does that mean we're already really separating the concept of a person from the concept of body parts from the concept of gender so those are three separate things so what is a person then considered apart from their body parts and their gender well so what do you what is a person a person is just like this abstract concept floating in the ether is that is that is that the idea of a person that you have it's like saying many people don't see haier as having a color people have hair color it anyway as a result going back to the gut and as a result the notion that a penis is exclusively a male body part and a vulva is exclusively a female body part is inaccurate oh that's how many people see it is okay so that's that's how people see it alright people see it that way if people see it as the as people see the earth as being flat well then I guess the earth is flat right because people see it that way by using the word parts to talk about genitals and using medical terms for anatomy without attaching a gender to it we become much more able to effectively discuss safe sex in a way that's clear and inclusive for the purposes of this guide will refer to the vagina as the front hole instead of solely using the medical term vagina this is gender inclusive language that's considerate of the fact that some trans people don't identify with the labels the medical community attaches to their genitals um well guess what I don't identify as having arms I don't like that I don't I don't think I have arms I've decided that I don't have arms so don't call them arms anymore you have to think of a new word because I don't identify as having arms so if I go to the doctor and they say look at your arms I'm going to be traumatized because what do you mean I don't identify as having them right so in that that's how this work now this works now for example some trans and non-binary identified people assigned female at birth may enjoy it now let's stop there for a second as I've said a million times your sex is not assigned to you now notice something here they use the phrase assigned female so that's they're not even usually they try to draw this ridiculous distinction between gender and sex you know like there's a two different things but female is definitely sex so what this medical guide is claiming is that your sex it's not just gender your sex your biological is assigned to you by the doctor after you are born that is what weird that's what we're being told now by like your your actual sex is something that your doctor decides randomly arbitrarily just yep that one's a girl could it be that it could have been a boy could have been a dragon could have been a could have been the tooth fairy but now we've decided to make it a girl um and anyway it goes on from there talking about front holes and so forth now two quick things number one I don't want to get overly graphic here but front hole is not even an anatomically correct description of the body part that you have renamed that's all I'll say number two you really see the corseting of the culture here that I am forced to sit here in front of mixed company and talk about front holes like that's not I would prefer not to talk about these like it this should be and we are all all of us we are way too comfortable having these kinds of conversations with each other where we're using words like front hole and we're talking about you know these sorts of things and that's what the culture is done because when you've got it's kind of like the choice that we have is we can ignore this kind of stuff and we can elect it we can let this insanity happen we're body parts are being renamed in order to in order to indulge the the fantasies of mentally disordered individuals we can just let that happen and say fine and not acknowledge it or we can engage with it and address it and and oppose it but in doing so we're forced to have these kinds of conversations and I think that that latter option is the correct option we have to engage we have to we can't just allow this this insanity to occur but it it means necessarily that we all kind of end up down in the muck and we're all affected by the coarsening of the culture it's the same thing when you've got people who are literally marching down the street announcing their sex lives to the entire world it's like hey everybody guess what kind of sex we like to have and we're proud of it when people are doing that again there's the corseting of the culture where we it's like we don't want to know we'd rather not know we'd rather not talk about but you are shoving it in our face and now we're forced to have this conversation which is not even a conversation that we we want to have with strangers in public this is private stuff we shouldn't even be talking about it but we're forced to now the LGBT folks have been trying to make front hole happen for a while now and so I did I wrote a piece yesterday where I suggested some other new words to take the place of offensive body part labels I mean if we're doing front health and I suggested like lookee hole for eyes smell stick for nose hearing flaps for ears your mouth is now you're talking side dangler forearms like I said arms is offensive to me so call them side danglers your fingers are your pointy graspers okay they're not fingers anymore your legs or your trunk stems they're not legs and actually the entire human body is now just a skin holder it's not a body it's a skin holder and you know we could go through we get there many but every every part of the human body is probably offensive to someone so we could rename them all okay let's table that story for a minute and I want to go over and look at something else that is seems to be completely unrelated here's another story after more than a century behind bars the beasts on boxes of animal crackers are roaming free Mondelez international parent company of Nabisco has redesigned the packaging of its Barnum's animal crackers after relenting to pressure from people for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA which has been protesting the use of animals and circuses for more than 30 years we wrote a letter to the company in the spring of 2016 calling for a redesign given the egregious cruelty inherent in circuses that use animals and the public swelling opposition to the exploitation of animals used for entertainment we urged Nabisco to update its packaging in order to show animals who are free to roam in their natural habitats what what PETA wanted to do is they wanted to free the caged animal crackers from their cages and have the Box redesigned so that it's not offensive anymore and the company decided to actually go ahead and do that so we've got those two things how are they related well they're both hilarious for one but for another they reveal something about progressivism namely that progressivism always progresses like a cancer it can't say stay still it can't stay in just one place it cannot it can't camp out and defend what it has gained it can't do that it has to always march forward or in whatever direction it's going we've got to really consider this to be forward but wherever it's going it always has to keep marching there it always has to find new battles to fight new victories and it's just this thing that's constantly moving and what happens when it has gotten to the point was it's already won the culture it's already achieved everything that it originally set out to do what happens then well then it's on to the animal crackers and it's on to the front wholes it has to move on to these ridiculous obscure issues because it has already achieved everything else they don't want it to achieve this is the problem with any movement once it gets where it's set out to go it doesn't know what to do with itself and that goes back to the famous quote about every cause begins as a movement becomes a business degenerates into a racket well progressivism is now it's it's it's it's even it's worse than a racket it's this it's this insane thing that is barreling forward and just consuming everything in its path path progressivism is a movement more than it's a philosophy it's a movement because it moves it's always moves and it simply wants to destroy what was old what existed before and replace it with something new the manipulation of language is a perfect example of this they want to get rid of old words and replace them with new words for no other reason than the fact that the new word is new and the old one is old you notice with this front whole thing they never explained what what exactly even if I were to accept the idea that the word vagina is offensive to trans people and therefore it has to be changed how is front whole better what what actually makes that less offensive nothing does it's just a new term it's a really dumb term it's crude it's crass it's juvenile and I think even an even just by saying front hole every time you say front hole you lose five IQ points that's what I've said it now ten times and then I've lost 50 IQ points by the time I'm done doing this this this video I'm gonna be I'm gonna be brain dead laying just laying here because that's how stupid it is but it's a new word and that's what progressives do they just take the old thing and put a new thing in its place it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if the new things and improvement and it doesn't even matter if the new thing actually addresses whatever problems allegedly existed with the old thing the new thing could have the same problems but even worse but it's put in place just because it's new new is always better so we always need new things all the old stuff has to be tossed in the fire that is that is that's what progressivism is doing just barreling forward in whatever direction it's going and destroying with whatever it's in its path and replacing it with new things and as progressivism moves and moves and moves it gets further and further away from anything that even vaguely resembles truth or reason or rationality and it descends further into insanity and now it has descended all the way into an animal cracker box and it is finding reasons to fight over animal crackers that's what that's what happens and so we can as conservatives it's kind of a double-edged sword because on one hand we can look at that and we can say we could point out that we can point out to everyone else we'd say well look at what progressivism it look look what it's become look what kind of arguments they're having look what look at what kind of things they're fighting for now look look at what they consider to be a victory now renaming the vagina into the frontal that's a that's a victory for them and we could point that out to try to guide people away from progressivism and we should be because it works to our benefit that progressivism has become so completely utterly insane but on the other hand the only reason that they've gotten at this point is that they is that they've been so successful and that they've won every other battle they they've basically accomplished everything everything that they wanted they got every battle they fought they won and that's how they've moved on to these sorts of things if you think about it they've they already redefined human life through abortion disqualifying all unborn children from from having the the title of human being that was an enormous accomplishment that they achieved decades ago they accomplished redefining marriage which even 20 years ago was an unthinkable thing but they've accomplished that so they've been going through and redefining tearing up tearing out what was what was what was old what was traditional tossing it in the fire putting something new in its place and they've done that with these huge things and because they've already achieved that now they can move on to these really small crazy issues so we should point to that and say look you don't want to be on that side you don't to be on the side of front holds and fighting over animal crackers but at the same time we should remember they only got to this point because of our failures as conservatives to defend the definition of human life sanctity of marriage and on and on and on all right thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed
