JESSE: WELCOME TO "WATTERS
WORLD," I'M JESSE WATTERS.
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK WAS A
REFRESHER FOR HOW DISHONEST THE
LEFT IS AND THEIR LAP DOGS IN
THE MEDIA.
THE OBAMA POLICY ON THE BORDER
WAS CATCH AND RELEASE.
BUT THE ILLEGALS SKIPPED THE
HEARINGS AND WENT UNCHECKED INTO
THE COUNTRY.
THIS POLICY ENCOURAGED ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
TRUMP WAS ELECTED TO SECURE THE
BORDER.
THAT'S WHAT THE VOTERS WANTED.
SO HE ENACTED A ZERO TOLERANCE
POLICY AT THE BORDER.
IF YOU BRING A MINOR, YOU ARE
BRIEFLY SEPARATED FOR A DAY OR
TWO THEN REUNITED THEN DEPORTED.
BUT IF YOU BRING A MINOR AND
CAN'T PROVE USUAL RELATED THE
FEDS WILL SEPARATE AND
INVESTIGATE IF YOU ARE A HUMAN
TRAFFICKER OR CHILD SMUGGLER.
THE COURT SAYS THEY CAN'T HOLD
THE CHILD FOR MORE THAN 20 DAYS
AND THEN MUST SEND THE CHILD TO
A FAMILY MEMBER OR FOSTER UNTIL
THE CLAIMS CAN BE COMPLETED.
OBAMA DID THE SAME THING.
TRUMP JUST DID IT AT A HIGHER
RATE BECAUSE ALL BORDER CROSSERS
ARE BEING PROSECUTED.
>> SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY WHERE OUTRAGED BY THE
CAGES AND THE THERMAL BLANKETS
AND THE FACILITIES HOUSING THESE
KIDS.
THEY WERE ALL THERE UNDER
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
DID YOU SPEAK UP AGAINST THEM
THEN?
>> ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE GET
INTO A MOMENT WHERE WE ARE
MAKING PROGRESS, THEN WHEN IT
STALLS, WE TURN AROUND.
I THINK WE ALL NEED TO CONTINUE
TO BE FOCUSED ON IT AND PRESS IT
THROUGH.
JESSE: WHAT WAS THAT SENATOR?
WAS THAT EVEN ENGLISH?
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST
SAID.
FOR THE RECORD THE DEMOCRATS
DON'T WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.
THEY WANT TO BLAME PROBLEMS ON
TRUMP AND DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.
HOW DO I KNOW THIS?
SENATOR CRUZ RELEASED A STAND
ALONE BILL THAT WOULD KEEP
CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS
TOGETHER AND THE DEMOCRATS
WOULDN'T VOTE ON IT BECAUSE THEY
WANTED TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON
TRUMP.
IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF DEMOCRATS
CARE AT ALL ABOUT KIDS.
JIMMY KIMMEL LED THE CHARGE.
>> JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT WE
COULDN'T GO ANY LOWER AS A
NATION, I AM SURE YOU HAVE SEEN
THE HEARTBREAKING IMAGES OF
FAMILIES BEING LITERALLY TORN
APART THANKS TO THE TRUMP
POLICY.
JESSE: CONGRESS MAKES
IMMIGRATION LAW, NOT THE
PRESIDENT.
THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SIGN AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER URGING FEDERAL
AGENTS TO KEEP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT
FAMILIES TOGETHER AND DEPORT
THEM TOGETHER.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WE'LL KEEP
FAMILIES TOGETHER BUT THE BORDER
WILL BE JUST AS TOUGH AS IT'S
BEEN.
DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES, JOBS,
HOSPITALS.
DEMOCRATS PUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
BEFORE THEY PUT AMERICAN
CITIZENS.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
JESSE: FAMILIES STAY TOGETHER
AND WE STILL HAVE A BORDER.
EVERYONE IS HAPPY, RIGHT?
WRONG.
>> FAMILIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
WILL BE LOCKED UP TOGETHER,
HOPEFULLY STARTING WITH HIS.
JESSE: THE LEFT IS NEVER HAPPY.
IT IS NEVER ABOUT POLICY.
IT'S ABOUT POLITICAL SCORING.
NO MATTER WHAT TRUMP DOES, HE'LL
BE ATTACKED BY THE MEDIA.
REMEMBER WHEN HE RAN FOR
PRESIDENT HE PROMISED TO BOMB
THE HELL OUT OF ISIS.
>> DROPPING BOMBS.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE TARGETS TO DROP
BOMBS ON.
IT'S AN APPLAUSE LINE FOR PEOPLE
WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE.
JESSE: WHEN TRUMP DEFEATED THE
ISIS CALIPHATE, INSTEAD OF
REPORTING ON HIS SUCCESS, HERE
WERE THE HEADLINES.
REMEMBER WHEN THE MEDIA WENT
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR NOT
GOING TO PORT ARE YOU KEY SOON
ENOUGH -- TO PUERTO RICO SOON
ENOUGH AFTER THE HURRICANE?
>> HE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT
ONE THING ONLY.
PUERTO RICO, PUERTO RICO, PUERTO
RICO.
JESSE: WHEN HE DID GO, THEY
DIDN'T LIKE HOW HE HAND OUT
SUPPLIES.
>> THIS WAS A P.R.17-MINUTE
MEETING.
THERE WAS NO EXCHANGE.
THIS TERRIBLE ABOMINABLE VIEW OF
HIM THROWING PAPER TOWELS AND
PROVISIONS AT PEOPLE.
IT DOES NOT EMBODY THE SPIRIT OF
THE AMERICAN NATION.
JESSE: TRUMP WAS SAVAGED FOR HIS
STRONG STANCE ON NORTH KOREA.
>> THIS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HAS
ANGER AND HOSTILITY AND
BELLICOSE RHETORIC AND THINGS
THAT AREN'T HELPFUL.
WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH AN
ADVERSARY LIKE NORTH KOREA.
JESSE: THEN WHEN HE ENGAGED IN
THE DIPLOMACY THE MEDIA WAS
PLEADING FOR, THIS WAS FRAMED AS
A LOSS.
>> SUMMIT IS NOT AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THIS
PRESIDENT.
IT'S A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR
KIM JONG-UN.
>> THERE IS NOTHING
UNPRECEDENTED ABOUT TRUMP'S
FIRST SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE.
ECONOMICALLY ANYWAY.
JESSE: NOW THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT
RATE DROPPED TO THE LOWEST IT'S
BEEN IN 20 YEARS, WE HEAR THIS.
>> HIP HIP HOORAY, EMPLOYMENT IS
DOWN, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO ME
IN MY LIFE.
JESSE: THE MEDIA IS NOT COVERING
