what about the door right here Lord I'm
gonna get to go home thank you Jesus
yeah wait a minute don't put that in
there yet
okay this is what we face on the back
two hours for an area I never thought
I'd have to experience nothing like this
in life this first time for everything
call 9-1-1 d lepers are on hold for
hours if it cuts at one point I wanted
to just hit my family out I was willing
to stay behind and try to save what I
could but my wife wasn't gonna leave
unless I left so I had to leave to get
her out all of this was totally
underwater just a few days ago
everything here this is my neighborhood
this is what we swam that up my home see
what's left as you can see
the water line it's from here we're
gonna have to find this place to stay
for at least but maybe six months just a
little bit overwhelmed you know but I'm
still I'm grateful you know just to be
here to tell the story you know I never
been to nothing like this before we
crawled through the window to the back
of the truck waiting for rescue that we
never did get we wind up leaving about
seven o'clock that evening when we
realized we have to swim out how are
both of you feeling right now
you know I've broken to say it but you
know it's just a rebuilding process now
we never expected it I mean we go
through it
and Houston is a strong City
we're known for helping each other out
and building ourselves back up what do
you think the next steps are
well replacing everything rebuilding
getting back up on our feet do you have
any sense of how much you've lost it des
materialistic we're not really worried
about that it's just a process the work
process after the back there's gonna be
more scrutinizing than anything do you
know where you're gonna sleep tonight oh
yeah we want to my daughter's house when
you walk through your front door just a
few moments ago what was running through
your mind it just don't look like oh I
just couldn't believe me you know seeing
stuff like that
I would never imagine that it I happen
to us but just saying everything is it's
over while I come home I see my
neighbors everybody's alright hey that's
a plus for me be careful for snakes
I'd rather be here than the people I was
now I can get something started on some
things that need to be done to try to
get everything back to normal
through it all we'll make it like I said
take it one day at a time from you
you
