hoopty doodle-doo it's time to get our knickers in a twist with a monthly visit to our favorite website everyday feminism everyday feminism is the site where you don't have to fall out of a second-story window and land on your head to know how it feels for your brains to turn to mush you just have to read the post and you'll get the idea this month on everyday feminism we find a video post that has been shared by over 21,000 people the post is entitled and I swear this is real can having genital preferences for dating Meanor anti-trans the post is authored by Riley J Dennis who describes himself as a queer trans non-binary lesbian which i think means a guy with long hair who put out for anybody the post begins with this urgent question and again this is a real quote is it sis sexist or anti trans to say that you wouldn't date a woman who has a penis the answer is more complicated than you might think unquote well since my answer is a wordless scream it's possible Riley GJ Dennis's answer is in fact more complicated let's find out Riley J Dennis begins by describing an issue that I know has been troubling many of you so what's been happening is that some people are making the argument that it's not sexist at all to only be attracted to people with one kind of genitals for example these people might argue that being attracted to only women with vaginas in no way negatively affects trans people now I know what you're thinking you're thinking how am I ever going to unsee that guy but wait there's more I'm not telling lesbians that they can't be lesbians if you're a woman who only likes women go ahead identify as a lesbian but some women have penises well I'm glad Riley J Dennis is not telling lesbians they can't be lesbians because I know lesbians were worried Riley J Dennis might pass that law and make life harder for them in Riley J Dennis's imagination which is the one place where Riley J Dennis's opinion matters anyway where were we oh yeah lesbians with penises wait aren't lesbians with penises basically just men and never mind let's look a little deeper into this issue so if we look a little deeper into this issue there's the possibility of your general preferences being at least somewhat partially informed by growing up in a this sexist society is also the fact that a preference is different than saying you would never do something like having a preference for tall girls is fine but refusing to date anyone under five seven is ridiculous so Riley J Dennis thinks we should all date short girls with penises and what Riley J Dennis thinks about who we should date is very important - Riley J Dennis as for the rest of us I think we should all visit everyday feminism from time to time to remind ourselves how lucky we are

news day as we're talking they're talking about voting on the new healthcare reform we're not going to comment about it yet and find out what happens this is in the house obviously it still has to go through the Senate conservatives are gonna scream and yell I think conservatives are going to be wrong I think this is actually a much much more clever bill than conservatives think it is I know they're saying oh you promise to repeal it and it's not repealing and now you own it and all this stuff and I don't think so I don't think so but we're gonna wait and see if they pass it and then we'll talk about it on Monday for those of you who survive the Clavin last weekend you few you happy few who survived the Clavin last weekend Trump was meeting with Mahmoud Abbas from the Palestinians this is this is the ritual of all American presidents the optimism of about solving the Palestinian Israel you know Wars and then just before everything goes to crap that's ritual they all have to do it oh yes so we're very the peace process is back and it's all gonna be great and then the killing starts again so we can wait for that that'll be good but you know to me the thing yesterday that really got me was that Comey hearing I was just happening as I was coming in yesterday so I didn't get a chance to hear to really you know think about it I think that the press missed the headline on the Comey here I mean I was looking here's the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal what they wrote about it right and it was basically all about commis letter the October 28th letter that Hillary Clinton blames for her losing the election okay and you know the news media I was in the news media a lot especially back in the 80s and that was when the news media changed that was when there were major cutbacks that was when they started to go for profit over just public service the old FCC idea was you major profit on the entertainment shows and then as a public obligation you had a news program and it wasn't supposed to be a profit Center and that was supposed to keep it clean and just deliver the information in the 80s they started firing people and bringing people on to say we've got to make a profit with our news department and that's when they started saying you know what you want to be talking about a sex you want to be talking about you know that boring old budget don't talk about the boring old budget you know let's get right to the condoms because that was during the AIDS crisis let's you know they were being able suddenly to talk about sexual behaviors that no one had ever mentioned on air before this was a big thrill to some of the news directors I got on a lot of fights back in those days with my god you know bosses and just saying this is a stupid cheap in any of the news but when you fire all when on the one hand you fire all your investigative reporting because investigative reporting is the most expensive because you pay these guys to go out and do these long-term stories and they don't really deliver for months and then suddenly you've got one story and it's over so you got rid of your investigative guys and the people who could still afford investigative reporters like the New York Times have become so politicized and corrupt that their own investigations disappear down the memory hole like when they did you know if you went on the New York Times business page and read about the 2008 crash you would have learned that much of it had to do with Democrat politicians like Barney Frank defending the corrupt and stupid practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and that and giving home loans to people who couldn't afford them which Wall Street then abused by packaging these things and getting people to pay for it a thousand times and when all that collapsed as george w bush was pleading with them to stop doing it right when all that collapse suddenly was all bush's fall all the republicans all Wall Street we keep hearing Wall Street Wall Street Wall Street and Barney Frank who should be in my opinion in prison you know it wrote the bill that was now going to fix everything the dodd-frank bill which is ridiculous because Chris Dodd and Barney Frank had their hands in that in that collapse more than anybody so all I'm saying is the truth was in the New York Times but the New York Times are so corrupt they basically buried it on the business page you never would have heard of it you would never the people who read the New York Times did not know what was in the New York Times because they bury it and they don't write about on the op-ed page which is the first thing everybody turns to so now you have Jim Comey get out here and it starts the thing is Hillary Clinton kind of directed the news attention to herself with this interview that she gave blaming everybody but herself for her loss but I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28th and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off and the evidence for that intervening event is I think compelling persuasive and so we overcame a lot in the campaign we overcame an enormous barrage of negativity of false equivalency and so much else but as Nate Silver who you know he doesn't work for me he's an independent analyst but one considered to be very reliable you know has concluded you know if the election men on October 27th I'd be your president and it wasn't it was on October 28th and there was just a lot of funny business going on around that and ask yourself this within an hour or two of the Hollywood access tape being made public the Russian theft of John Podesta's emails hit WikiLeaks what a coincidence one of those was Hillary Clinton I'm not sure which man is all somebody else's fault but the big thing was that letter that Comey now you remember what this was Comey had closed the investigation into Hillary Clinton's abuse of the private email server she hadn't been indicted but now then he said oh we found more on Anthony Weiner's computer we found more emails I'm gonna have to go and he wrote a letter to Congress telling them that he had to go and look at what this was and she feels that that's why she won as opposed to the fact that she was a crappy candidate so now Comey gets up before the Senate and he says he says it was terrible terrible thing that he had to do this that he had to write this letter so this is cut five look this is terrible it makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election but honestly it wouldn't change the decision everybody who disagrees with me has to come back to October 28th with me and stare at this and tell me what you would do would you speak or would you conceal and I could be wrong but we honestly made a decision between those two choices that even in hindsight and this has been one of the world's most painful experiences I would make the same decision see now here's the thing though it's not about going back to October 28th it's about going back to July 5th that was where protocol was completely shattered that was when he got up you Comey got up and gave a press conference saying Hillary had done all this stuff wrong she'd been incredibly reckless she had done you know every word she had said when she made that statement at the UN was a lie everything she said was a lie but there was no criminal intent now that was ridiculous most lawyers would agree that that was not the rule that you know if anybody else had done what she had done they had gone to prison but suddenly he says there's no criminal intent and he took away what the the Justice Department what Loretta Lynch was supposed to do the Attorney General was to decide whether on the merits she should prosecute he said no no no one would prosecute forget about it so suddenly that was where he made his mistake right that's what made the October 28th letter necessary so let's find out let's go back and look at why he did this and this to me was the headline right here this is number six the credibility and the integrity of the criminal justice process that the American people believe it to be and that it be in fact fair independent and honest and so what I struggled with in the spring of last year was how do we credibly complete the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails if we conclude there's no case there the normal way to do it we'd have the Department Justice announce it and I struggled as we got closer to the end of it the number of things had gone on so which I can't talk about yet that made me worry that the department leadership could not credibly complete the investigation and decline prosecution without Grievous damage to the American people's confidence in the in the justice system and then the capper was I'm not picking on the the Attorney General Loretta Lynch who I like very much but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me and I then said you know what the department cannot by itself credibly end this the best chance we have is a justice system is if I do something I never imagined before step away from them and tell the American people look here's what the FBI did here's what we found here's what we think and that that offered us the best chance of the American people believing in the system that it was done in a credible way that was a hard call for me to make to call the Attorney General that morning and say I'm about to do a press conference I'm not going to tell you what I'm going to say and I said to I hope some day you'll understand why think I have to do this but look I wasn't loving this I knew this would be disastrous for me personally but I thought this is the best way to protect these institutions that we care so much about and having done that and then having testified repeatedly under oath we're done this was done in a credible way there's no there there that when the Anthony Weiner thing landed on me on October 27th and there was a huge this what people forget new step to be taken we may be finding the golden missing emails that would change this case if I were not to speak about that it would be a disastrous catastrophic and seal there is the head of the FBI telling the Senate that he could he came out first of all he's a total drama queen so I'm not I'm not letting him off the hook I'll get back to that in a minute that this is not about letting Co me off the hook there is the head of the FBI telling the Senate he came out and gave that press conference because he did not believe Loretta Lynch the Attorney General and her Justice Department was credible that the people would believe it he said things had happened that he couldn't talk about and then there was of course the famous meeting between Loretta Lynch blandly sinister Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton that just completely exploded her credibility he felt he had to come out because basically the Attorney General was not trustworthy the the Justice Department was not trustworthy now I call him a drama queen because the right thing to do in that situation is to resign the right thing to do is to resign and blow the whistle and come out and say look I I can't prosecute this case fairly I cannot do what needs to be done because the Justice Department is protecting a political candidate and so here Chuck Grassley questions him about this pegging these question off a story in the New York Times The New York Times recently reported that the FBI had found a troubling email among the ones the Russians act from Democrat operatives the email reportedly provided assurances that attorney general Lynch would protect Secretary Clinton by making sure the FBI investigation quote/unquote didn't go too far how and when did you first learn of this document also who sent it and who received it that's not a question I can answer in this forum mr. chairman because it would call for a classified response I have briefed leadership of the intelligence committees on that particular issue but I can't talk about it here you can expect me to follow up with you on that point sure you can cut it there it goes on and on with call me saying he's not gonna talk about whether there was an email saying that that was hacked by you know WikiLeaks saying that Loretta Lynch was going to protect Hillary Clinton and keep this investigation from going too far what was exposed yesterday the narrative that was exposed yesterday was a drama queen FBI guy reacting to an Attorney General and a Justice Department under the Obama administration so corrupt that he couldn't do his job he didn't react in the right way but Hillary Clinton is essentially complaining that she lost the election because she was so corrupt that the FBI dropped the ball on how corrupt she was I mean that was the story that was the story and I think if there was still investigative reporters that would be the story they were covering all right have we got Heather excellent Heather McDonald is the Thomas W Smith fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of city journal where she has covered a range of topics including higher education immigration homelessness policing and criminal justice reform and race relations as I have said a million times I think Heather is one of the very few of the best reporters in this country if she were a leftist she would have a stack of Pulitzer Prizes on her desk her newest book is The New York Times bestseller the war on cops which I read I thought it was a deeply important book really worth reading that was in 2016 and it's about basically about the fact that black lives matter has got it all wrong how you doing Heather thanks for having me on drew and thank you for those kind words I greatly appreciate it no it's all true and I've said it I've said it for years I'm glad the the bestseller list finally reflects it I noticed I mean it is incredible to me you are one of the few reporters who goes out into the street to get this story who really goes and gets and you're never on mainstream TV they never turn to you even as a dissenting voice to say you know here's black lives matter on one side here's Heather on the other they never do it well after the five Dallas officers were assassinated in in July last year CNN toyed with having me on the Saturday the day after and then canceled of course of course I mean you cannot have a more concrete demonstration of the fact that they are simply unwilling to listen to the other side well speaking of that recently you were out here in California and you went to Pomona and UCLA and I think this story got a little swept away and all the kind of drama at Berkeley which was also definitely interesting but could you describe especially the Pomona experience because it's it I mean shocking is an overused word but it's shocking can you describe what happened when you went first of all you went to speak about the black lives matter war on cops issue was that what you were there for yes I was there to talk about my book and to make my argument that there's no government agency more dedicated to the proposition that black lives matter than the police and they gave before I got to Claremont McKenna I got an email from one of the administrators saying they got wind of protests and we're looking to move my talk to a building with fewer plate glass windows and better means of egress did it right they said well we haven't heard any more about these protests and we're keeping it in the original building known as the Athenaeum I was put into a safe house for about two hours during which I with the blinds drawn during which I heard the chanting growing louder and louder and the drumming I saw petite blonde woman walked by with her face covered in a Palestinian headscarf of course a big battery pack on her back like a jet pack to amplify her bullhorn there was a what appeared to be a lookout posted on the that may be a football field of Leonor on my looking over into my balcony I didn't see what was happening however I that was outside my range of vision what I learned later was that the building the Athenaeum was being blockaded by about 250 to 300 students who prevented anybody from entering whether it's their fellow students or professors they made very short shrift of the police efforts at protecting the entrances to completely ignored the barricades the officers have put up the cops did by let them take over the building so all of the events that had been planned for me to talk to the students beforehand the dinner all went out the window I addressed a large empty auditorium they moved the podium away from the visual range of the windows because they were worried that when night fell and the podium became lit up then it would be visible to the outside people who are banging on the windows so I gave my talk to an empty room the people that were in it were basically police officers was concerning because they were glued to what was happening outside the windows which I could hear which again was people banging on the windows chanting I took two questions from a live streamed audience and then the cops decided that they could no longer guarantee my safety and so the QA was peremptorily shut down and a escape plan was out the kitchen so I was quickly hustled out through a group of students perched on some stairs and put into a police van and we sped away to the Clermont Police Department unbelievable unblended ministration of the college done anything any disciplinary action at all nothing that I'm aware of yet the president said he was planning to do so I suppose there's a certain amount of due process for once these being protesters have not alleged male heterosexual male rapist you know what the normal a reasonable expectation is to see whether president show doshas is true to his word or not frankly in this case will not be surprised if he does levy some sort of punishment because this event has been a real black eye for Claremont McKenna I mean you wrote a piece that I thought was sensational in City Journal about a letter that some of the black protesters who called themselves we phew I was I was happy to hear like Henry the fifth quad was a wee few uh-huh but but this what you said about this letter I thought was got to the heart of it first can you describe what they were their argument was garbled high theory and if I know if I can't read it literally it cannot be summarized I mean you have to you have to read this stuff it is it is a parody of academic discourse that today substitutes for thinking to the extent they had an argument it was pot and rehashed Michel Foucault claiming that the Enlightenment is responsible for the concept of truth and somehow truth is oppressive and even more so free speech is oppressive they claim that the Enlightenment is responsible for racism patriarchy colonialism feminism what has to be understood and and the other thing that I say about this is that their writing is simply abysmal they cannot construct sentences they have no sense of what grammar or syntax or usages and these are students some of the co signatories are graduating this year this shows what is going on in college campuses especially for minority students because nobody dares correct their writing they've been brought in under double standards you know to their to their misfortune because nobody is helped by preferences that bring you into an academic environment that you're not prepared to to operate in but but the other thing is is that their their history is so ignorant you know it is it is facile its consists only of labels without knowledge behind it and for them to charge that free speech is oppression leaving aside their ignorance of the Enlightenment and we know for sure that they've never read Voltaire of D de haut or can't or Hume for them to say that free speech is oppression ignores the fact that free speech was essential to getting rid of slavery as Frederick Douglass himself wrote in 1860 in a plea for free speech saying slavery cannot survive free speech it was essential to the civil rights movement so the one thing that you would think with Black Studies in college and the American high school curriculum being taken over exclusively by the black story that they would understand is the importance of the First Amendment to liberating minorities in this country and yet they're ignorant even of that and you know your point about the ground of this letter which I thought was really well made in your in your article it's not a small point it is not a small point that these kids have gone through college ignorant of history ignorant of the English language ignorant incapable of writing a letter with an argument in it I mean that's a major major failure of the professors the academics at this institution I mean that that is a terrible thing to have done to them but let's move on to the actual meat of what you're saying what did you go to say that was that made you such a danger to these people that they would resort to violence I mean what yeah I mean you seem like a perfectly nice person well what was the what was the heart of what you were going to say to them I said that there is enormous support for the police what I promised my remarks was was I said for the last two hours I've been hearing chants that black lives matter and of course I don't know if you get censored on this Jesse f the police I don't know if you bleeped out how about those a sweet huh and of course hey hey ho ho Heather Mac has got to go and from Palestinian to this from from something to the C Palestinians must be free but what I said was I've been hearing about black lives mattering I hope that you therefore were just as upset when Aaron Shannon jr. a five-year-old boy in South Central Los Angeles was shot to death in his spider-man costume on Halloween in 2010 by a kitchen Crips gang member I hope that you were equally upset when Tyshawn Lee in 2015 November in Chicago was lured into an alley with the promise of candy by his father's gang enemies and assassinated in cold blood the original plan had been to to cut off Tyson's fingers and send them to his mother the the killers of tyshaun escaped with the body in the trunk and dumped it in Indiana not a single black lives matter protesters showed up at that event but I said the people who did care about it were the police they worked their hearts day and night to bring that killer to justice the father himself refused to cooperate with the police and identifying his son's killers typical of gang members and the no snitch ethnic in the inner city and I went on to say if any of you had had any loved one lost to gun violence the first thing you would do is called the police and the second thing you would do is ask why is that thug why was he still on the streets because he would inevitably have had a long criminal record and yet contrary to the myth of mass incarceration would be out on the streets free to kill again you know it makes a weird kind of sense when they write a letter saying that objectivity is not a real thing the truth is not a real thing that that only leaves the story that's being told it makes perfect sense that they have to silence you because you're bringing facts that ruin their their narrative and that's that there is a weird horrible logic to it let me ask you one more question before I let you go and I don't want to I don't want to put you on the spot politically because I know you're not that kind of journalist but it's clearly the Obama administration was guilty of exacerbating this problem of casting the police in a terrible light how do you feel things are going now is this an improvement is what's happening now an improvement for the police or it's you know staying the same or or how do you feel about it no it's enormous improvement Trump got it right he said there's a false narrative about the police he pledged to restore law and order during the campaign he was the only person who pointed to the rising black homicide toll thanks to the black lives matter narrative and the fact that cops are not backing off of proactive policing in inner cities and amazingly this shows you how perverse our racial rhetoric is when when Trump said that black parents have the same right to be able to walk their child to school without fear that that child will be shot as white parents do he was denounced as a racist President Obama dismissed the rising black homicide told we had the largest one year in Creason homicides in 2015 in nearly 50 years overwhelmingly the victims were black 900 more black males were killed in 2015 compared to the previous year Obama said not to worry Trump's exaggerating it's just a blip in a few cities in other words black lives matter don't matter when they haven't been taken by a police officer jeff Sessions his Attorney General is doing great things he wants to review federal consent decrees for police departments which have grotesquely unnecessary wildly expensive and take officers off the streets right endless reports for this overpaid ignorant federal monitor so no I have I have big hopes that at least the narrative coming out of the White House will change that that will I hope Remora lies the cops Heather McDonald excellent reporter the war on cops a terrific book it's great to see you and I hope you'll come back and we'll talk some more you know I got a stop here for and just talk for just a minute about the rhetoric on the right okay because I get it the budget recently was kind of stinky you know we're not gonna get a repeal of Obamacare which is absurd an absurd hope the fact that people thought that they were just gonna repeal Obamacare and send these congressmen back you know they're not all from southern states then all from hyper conservative states some of these guys are from moderate you know a lot of these guys are from moderate states they can't go back and tell people oh yeah you lost insurance but you know we promise to repeal it so you know now you can't pay for your kids health care they're not going to go back and do that it's politics there's compromises I know it sticks in the Wrights craw reality sometimes sticks in the craw of commentators who don't have to wrangle cats up on Capitol Hill but the difference between this government and the last government and the government we didn't have that we would have had if we had elected Hillary Clinton is a difference an unbelievable difference the fact that our police are getting support the fact that Jeff Sessions is pulling off as Heather said the Jeff Sessions is pulling off those federal you know guys who know nothing about police work they only know about racial grievances and you know we keep talking about Neil Gorsuch but you know I've been reading recently some of the theories on the left of left-wing Supreme Court justices like Breyer about the First Amendment and what it means they don't believe in free speech they do not believe in free speech you know I'm not exaggerating they believe that oh yeah you know the First Amendment is supposed to protect the environment in which we can speak it's not you know it's not supposed to protect necessarily what Heather McDonald is saying because that doesn't preserve the environment you know we dodged a bullet the size of a 50/50 shell and I you know I don't care what anybody says I understand that we have to complain I understand that we have to ride the Congress you know there's nothing wrong with putting pressure on the Congress to move it to the right all this stuff but to sit and think that this is not such a so much better than what we would have had is insane and so while you're complaining and while your grousing about the latest thing just remember just remember that bullet was the size of a can tank bullet and we dodged it and Trump is basically I you know like I said like I said we'll see how he does in the legislative arena we will see I will talk about the health care bill assuming it gets through the house I'll talk about that on Monday if anybody survives the clayvin this weekend which I know it's always cutting your run thing but you know I just I just think that while we're complaining it is not the wrong thing to say that at least we have a guy in office at least we have Vice Congress now that does think about the lives of black people because I care a lot more I care a lot more about that little kid in his spider-man outfit who was proudly showing it off who got blown away by a gang member then I care about the gang member who gets shot down by the police even if the cop made a mistake you know I mean this is this is absurd we have moved into a world of absolute illogic you know the guy we started with talking from the everyday feminism whether it's that guy with their sexual insanity or these black lives matter guys essentially attacking the one group that cares about whether they live or die that protects the safety of their neighborhoods and that has been integrated and changed to answer some of the true grievances that they hadn't about a couple of decades ago you know it's insane and at least this president like him he does things that I I would have had hair by now if we that's guy just could be quiet sometimes you know he sometimes drives me crazy but it is better it is better and much better than it would have been or that it then it has been for the last eight years and while we're complaining we ought to take a little time to celebrate that stuff I like as we go into the this this is a double stuff I like because this is you know I've said this before I know but I'm like one of the only people I know who listens to music in the movies because some of the music in the movies is the best there is and I always tell this story about Chariots of Fire I went before it opened with my wife and I walked out and I said great score and she said what score who listened to the music in the movies and of course that became one of the most famous scores ever but here is a film first of all that you probably haven't seen and it is worth saying that it's called the Molly Maguires it's a 1970 film based by directed by Martin Ritt who is an excellent director it had Richard Harris and Sean Connery so it has a fantastic cast in it and has Samantha Eggar who is one of the most beautiful actresses who ever lived I was so madly in love with her where she was at her prime which she is in the Molly Maguires and it's a terrific story based on a true story set in nineteenth-century Pennsylvania and it talks about a coal mining basically they're kind of Union terrorists trying to overcome the abuses of coal miners and as the the detective who was sent in to infiltrate them it's based on a true story it's really good the score is by the great Henry Mancini you did so many scores I can't even pink panther you know Moon River is his I mean he just just so many scores and the theme song is great but I'm not gonna play the theme song buried in this for about is it's it's literally there for 15 seconds is a love theme of such heart-melting Beauty that it got me I was like it comes and goes in 15 second love scene between I think it's Richard Harrison Samantha Eggar and it's played in the background but it's stuck in my head forever and of course now we have everything on line so here is the love theme from the Molly Maguires and then we'll come back and say goodbye great stuff henry mancini the love theme for the modeling requires and the picture is good to the Clavin this weekend is upon us Run For Your Lives survivors gather here that daily wire.com on Monday I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show we will see the remnants of you then
