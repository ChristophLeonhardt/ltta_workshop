00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,949
Nicholas Carlson let's get right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

3
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,090
questions first we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with</font>

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,760
Logan<font color="#E5E5E5"> item who asks where do you think</font>

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,070
my space will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a company and as a</font>

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,820
product 365 days from today so let's

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about where they think they'll be</font>

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,029
and where they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be anything</font>

9
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,380
they're going to be this entertainment

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,630
portal place where you go for TV shows

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">music maybe some video games like the</font>

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,690
way you play video games on facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

13
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,800
that's that's their goal that's their

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,090
hope that's why they've hired people

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,520
from slingbox and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've brought in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of great product executives where</font>

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,110
their action will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe approaching</font>

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero that company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is losing a lot of</font>

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,710
momentum and is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bigger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> busts</font>

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,800
in terms of purchases on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet in</font>

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,340
recent memory this is from current AOL

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,550
and he asked or she asked is it true

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,489
that your sources in quotes are actually

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,159
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually slumming around the AOL</font>

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,630
headquarters trying to get people to

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,960
speak to you and the answer is I don't

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,880
know if slumming is the appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> term</font>

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,180
but yes we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have people going out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,420
the field reporting on stories and

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,420
trying to get word from actual people

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,509
what's actually going on it's a shocking

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,110
new tool that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to innovate</font>

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,329
on reporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right this is from</font>

34
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,610
Maria<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marie who asked does Henry treat</font>

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,470
you well is this a better gig for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

36
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,659
than Gawker was so I'm loving it here

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,729
but let me let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of phrase this</font>

38
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,229
question different way because I think

39
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">one interesting thing has happened at</font>

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,310
Gawker Media recently is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick</font>

41
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,500
Denton who owns who owns the company has

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,110
recently decided to start paying the

43
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,149
writers as full-time employees they're

44
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,250
no longer permal answers or permanent

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,020
freelance contractors they used to be

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,270
paper story then they got contracts and

47
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,740
now he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about transitioning</font>

48
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,479
them into full-time employees this is a

49
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,820
big step for Gawker and they also just

50
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,829
recently transitioned from a limited

51
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">liability corporation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a partnership</font>

52
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,390
into a into a corporation so something's

53
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,330
going on there

54
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,290
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

55
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,540
public but for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's</font>

56
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,370
just something as simple as<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax purposes</font>

57
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,560
maybe the next looking on take on new

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,600
investors but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something going</font>

59
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">on with a company it's becoming a little</font>

60
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,620
bit dare i say more legitimate so now

61
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,760

who asks where is the best place to ski

63
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,760
during the holiday break so the best

64
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
place to ski is probably a Swiss Alps or
