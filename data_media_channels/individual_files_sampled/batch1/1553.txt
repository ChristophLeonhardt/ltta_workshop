mommy no Ibaka Arden has cholera and she's severely dehydrated but no one can get intravenous fluids into her body for now Edmund ones attempts to get a line in are no more successful than others mommy no like most of the children here should have been brought to hospital earlier they may not look it but the other cholera sufferers are in a less serious condition than Mamina while cholera can kill really quickly given the right treatment in a prompt fashion in units such as this and patients can be recovering in this room within a matter of hours the atmosphere is quite different here much karma it's a waterborne disease and Dadaab normally has cholera outbreaks in rainy seasons but this year's flooding crisis in Kenya is the worst for 20 years what eight agencies call targeted intervention is being used sending teams to disinfect areas where people have fallen sick with cholera currently there the number is not reducing and it's increasing the more we do this targeted intervention the number that reduces in that particular section so it's a matter of extending but there's no sign of this outbreak being contained yet we did it in previous years I am sure that we can do it this year the main issue is to avoid mortality and that's what we are doing from outside they are trying here announcements of ways to avoid cholera but in a complex with 235 thousand refugees poor sanitation and no means of stopping the rain it's hard back in hospital Edmund one eventually finds a solution form amino he puts a line into her skull you're now happy react systole it should be positive news although merino is one child in thousands whose lives are under threat Andrew Simmons al-jazeera Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya
