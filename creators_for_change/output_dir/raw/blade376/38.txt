1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
hey everyone hope all is well I have

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">been asked for many weeks and many</font>

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,319
months by you guys for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my thoughts on</font>

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,840
the EU referendum should the UK choose

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,019
to stay in the european union or leave

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,389
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've stayed away from this for a</font>

7
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,130
long time because I've honestly been

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,980
undecided and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">been sat on the fence it's more that</font>

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,210
I've been jumping over it again and

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,439
again between both sides because I have

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,390
had so many problems with the European

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,480
Union for many years those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,530
know me will know that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am very anti</font>

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,430
establishment I am so on who is for

16
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,649
decentralized more networked society I

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that centralized power is flawed</font>

18
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,219
and I'm always looking at the best way

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,699
for us to achieve that goal which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,800
think will be helped with technology as

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,129
the advancements continue to accelerate

22
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,800
exponential rates I think we're going to

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,899
be seeing a very different world because

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of Technology in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years and</font>

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,799
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a very interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point and</font>

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,299
although i wasn't going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a video</font>

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,640
on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the referendum is</font>

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,070
tomorrow and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was thinking of what to</font>

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,460
do a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it seemed absurd to do it</font>

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,950
on any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other topic than this so what I</font>

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,140
wanted to do today was just to lay out

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,630
some thoughts I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been having</font>

33
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,880
throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> this referendum campaign</font>

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,820
which I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are all sick of as</font>

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">much as I am due</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the way it's been</font>

36
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,450
run I think it's been quite ugly and

37
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,720
intellectually dishonest on both sides I

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,850
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's this perception from</font>

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,880
the in campaign where they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,409
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a lot of the</font>

41
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,649
negatives that come with being in the EU

42
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:54,710
other than saying yes it needs reform

43
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,680
they seem scared to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,479
then on the left side they're unwilling

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,729
to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> details about what the</font>

46
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,890
negatives are with leaving and I just

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,780
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's been a real shame</font>

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,870
overall there are people i dislike on

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,390
both

50
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,310
of the campaign so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you can</font>

51
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,000
make a judgment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that but there are</font>

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i adore on both sides as</font>

53
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,900
well and actually some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like for</font>

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,880
particular reasons but dislike or many

55
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,300
others so for example nigel farage i am

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,050
not a fan of at all but many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I</font>

57
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,620
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enjoy watching him completely</font>

58
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,010
take on members of the European Union in

59
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,500
debates and just lay into them I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,390
enjoy that it felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the only</font>

61
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,200
opportunity we had of you know fighting

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,330
back against this institution that is

63
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,500
seen as grossly undemocratic and then

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,600
there's people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> daniel Hannan I</font>

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,190
hopefully pronounce his name right who

66
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an MEP who is fully leave campaign</font>

67
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,690
absolutely brilliant orator very arid I

68
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,100
articulate and he made a great closing

69
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,989
argument during a debate and a few weeks

70
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago which I loved and on and on the</font>

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a lot of great</font>

72
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,040
people there but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the key</font>

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,650
issues the main one I want to talk about

74
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,320
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is immigration and then I'm going</font>

75
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of go off in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the direction of</font>

76
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,130
the concept of democracy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

77
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,750
European Union as a political and

78
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,530
economic institution to immigration has

79
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,920
been the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and I think we</font>

80
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be honest when we talk about can</font>

81
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,079
immigration be a problem and the answer

82
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,079
is yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people often talk about the</font>

83
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:47,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">notion of supply and demand and so the</font>

84
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,120
bigger your population the greater the

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,459
demand and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a constant</font>

86
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,860
increase of immigration that demand is

87
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go up and so it's a question of</font>

88
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,620
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to have supply</font>

89
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,829
you know cater for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing number</font>

90
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,269
and what I find unfortunate is the EU

91
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:09,640
referendum is seen as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we are</font>

92
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take back control of that when</font>

93
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,579
we're basing this on years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font>

94
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,339
governments who have actually been under

95
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,089
funding our public services that is not

96
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,000
to say that immigration can't be a

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,010
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for those you that</font>

98
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,990
no sort of my background<font color="#E5E5E5"> I very much</font>

99
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,210
look at things from a futuristic

100
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,610
perspective with the capabilities of

101
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Technology and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much an advocate</font>

102
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,220
for something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a resource-based</font>

103
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,680
economy which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're able</font>

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,540
to achieve yet but i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we are moving</font>

105
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,520
in that direction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the notion</font>

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you scan the planet for resources</font>

107
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,350
to see where they where the resource

108
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,310
pockets are four different materials and

109
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,270
then you work out the best way to

110
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,890
allocate them accordingly for the

111
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,990
carrying capacity of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> planet and the</font>

112
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,040
population<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sits on that and that</font>

113
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,560
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true with the world today if</font>

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,240
you have wealth and income inequality

115
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,970
which goes across borders like many of

116
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,500
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues that we talked about when</font>

117
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,510
discussing whether or not to stay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

118
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,720
not terrorism<font color="#E5E5E5"> the refugee crisis tax</font>

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">evasion if there is a growing economy if</font>

120
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,540
jobs have been created somewhere which

121
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,310
has been the case in the UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we can</font>

122
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,970
argue what kind of jobs those are then

123
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,590
naturally<font color="#E5E5E5"> people going to move in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

124
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,890
direction for a better life and so

125
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,970
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an argument that in the</font>

126
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,070
European Union that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

127
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,360
create standards that stretch across all

128
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these countries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that there is more</font>

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,790
encouragement for people to get jobs all

130
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,180
over the place so it kind of spreads the

131
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,520
the concentration of migration and many

132
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,070
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that hasn't worked but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

133
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,870
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the need for the supply of</font>

134
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,580
public services and we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

135
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,980
government that is happily gone on with

136
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,140
austerity they've not apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

137
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,740
they say it's necessary but then they're

138
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,170
not willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the problems</font>

139
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,480
with immigration so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be one of</font>

140
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things or in fact it can be both</font>

141
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,340
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have often talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

142
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,930
immigration has had a net contribution

143
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,020
in terms of the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money that</font>

144
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,140
they bring to our economy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's</font>

145
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,700
a question of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

146
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,250
then gets invested into the public

147
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,690
services needed for that growing

148
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,080
population I would argue it's not being

149
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,180
used that way and so we have a

150
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,010
population as I've mentioned already

151
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,409
that are voting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the EU</font>

152
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,330
around immigration when we've actually

153
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,619
not seen our society function in a

154
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:50,039
sustainable way with measures and

155
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,689
policies that our governments could

00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,489
control and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions on because</font>

157
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not a part of their ideology and</font>

158
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,569
this makes me think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a known</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chomsky</font>

159
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,300
quite around<font color="#E5E5E5"> privatization which I think</font>

160
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,339
sums up the broader problem with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

161
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">this we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even look at when</font>

162
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:06,809
conservatives in both the leave and in

163
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,419
campaigns are asked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these</font>

164
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,479
numbers they give of what levels they

165
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,389
want to have immigration at and how that

166
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,759
non EU immigration is way above what

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,209
they said and conservatives in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

168
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,069
campaign and in the lead campaign

169
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,619
probably poor choice of words there have

170
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:28,110
said yes yes we need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> better on</font>

171
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but then you're arguing some of</font>

172
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,119
them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to leave the EU so we</font>

173
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,489
can take more control on this and where

174
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,979
we do have control they're not making

175
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,169
enough progress now you may say yeah we

176
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,339
should get rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the current government</font>

177
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a new one that may be so I just</font>

178
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:46,829
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like people a lot of people don't</font>

179
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,050
realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential we have to have a</font>

180
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,110
really prosperous society because for so

181
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,169
long we've just lived we're in a society

182
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:57,209
where the reality is austerity that's

183
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,550
the way things are and it creates an

184
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,949
us-versus-them mentality it creates a

185
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,169
race to the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that</font>

186
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,159
leaving would perpetuate that and that's

187
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,499
a real concern I have and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

188
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:12,179
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too off topic here although i</font>

189
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,129
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related in some ways but if</font>

190
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,899
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the panama papers which</font>

191
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,399
revealed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are tens of</font>

192
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,289
trillions of dollars being sat on in

193
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,199
this world in offshore havens that is

194
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,259
not being invested<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere not being</font>

195
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,789
invested into public services into

196

infrastructure all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it's</font>

197
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">just been sat on an accumulating more</font>

198
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:34,019
well through interest etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find</font>

199
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,149
that incredibly frustrating because it

200
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that we do have the potential to</font>

201
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,399
feed<font color="#CCCCCC"> howls clove provide public services</font>

202
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,679
for everybody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this planet so there is</font>

203
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:50,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">not this divisive a feeling of hitting a</font>

204
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,060
dog-eat-dog<font color="#CCCCCC"> world out there and so</font>

205
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,860
income and wealth inequality is a real

206
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,750
issue we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at of how do we</font>

207
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,240
raise tax revenues to pay for the

208
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,150
services that is needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done by</font>

209
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,560
government and the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'd say on</font>

210
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,180
immigration and just to take one<font color="#E5E5E5"> step</font>

211
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,420
further back is one of the reasons this

212
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,700
has become such<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge problem is</font>

213
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,800
firstly the government's not being

214
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,890
willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk honestly about it for</font>

215
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,080
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons I've explained already</font>

216
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,779
but secondly of why this has been caused

217
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,450
now I'm going to give you one<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason and</font>

218
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not saying this answers everything</font>

219
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,910
and this is of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course up for debate but</font>

220
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,870
neoliberalism has been a problem for

221
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,970
decades<font color="#CCCCCC"> now where the Western world has</font>

222
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,620
been happy to exploit other countries

223
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,720
extract their resources and not invest

224
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,640
back into them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we want to take</font>

225
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that wealth and you know profits for</font>

226
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,560
ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that adds to the income</font>

227
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,210
and wealth inequality across the world

228
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,279
it's why some countries have such

229
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,470
terrible working conditions it's why

230
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,339
some countries have such poor employment

231
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,740
levels and naturally people will want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

232
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,630
then move to other places where it's

233
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,030
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where it's better tends to be</font>

234
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,280
those countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> free neoliberalism</font>

235
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,730
have reaped the most rewards and so I

236
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,980
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at how do we</font>

237
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,110
create a world where there is investment

238
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,780
all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the place so we can spread</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

239
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,780
wealth and prevent these concentrations

240
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause mass influxes of emigration</font>

241
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,350
immigration that concerns so many people

242
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,540
and when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these issues that</font>

243
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,520
go across borders climate<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

244
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,220
terrorism the refugee crisis tax

245
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,380
avoidance this moves us<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

246
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">big issue which is the notion of</font>

247
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,050
sovereignty and democracy which is

248
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,459
something I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge problem with</font>

249
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,640
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the European Union accountability</font>

250
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,550
it's so so important but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the reasons</font>

251
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,910
I've said already about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our government</font>

252
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,279
and what their views are within our own

253
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,200
country with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things they can control</font>

254
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,480
I do wonder how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people</font>

255
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that oppose the undemocratic parts of</font>

256
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,670
the EU actually opposed the fact we have

257
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,560
an undemocratically elected head of

258
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,860
state the royal family

259
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,410
and we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> House of Lords which i</font>

260
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is of around 800 people I wonder</font>

261
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,050
if we should get our own house sorted

262
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,820
first and then we look at the bigger

263
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,010
picture but some of you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue it</font>

264
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,270
should be done the other way around we

265
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,460
should release the shackles from the EU

266
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then we can deal with these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

267
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,030
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i bet you a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that</font>

268
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">are in government for the lead campaign</font>

269
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,720
wouldn't want to reform those particular

270
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,990
things and it also brings us to the

271
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,890
romanticized idea of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EU and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

272
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">britain on the in campaign some have</font>

273
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,500
this romanticized idea of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EU as such</font>

274
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,480
a fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> institute which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in some</font>

275
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,380
ways but i think it's overly played out

276
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,840
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i find it gross</font>

277
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,940
and actually with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font>

278
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,890
that want out say you know don't

279
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,750
underestimate the power of<font color="#CCCCCC"> great britain</font>

280
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's a lot of nationalism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

281
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,300
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in a racist way</font>

282
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,350
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some of those tones</font>

283
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,120
there but I mean nationalism is

284
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,470
something I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem with</font>

285
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,600
generally it's not that I hate Britain

286
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,750
it's that I look onwards to<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating a</font>

287
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,360
global world of unity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this leads me</font>

288
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
to my final point which is there's a lot

289
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,090
of talk about experts some say we've had

290
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough of the experts some people</font>

291
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,820
believe the experts are the

292
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,170
establishment that are just going to do

293
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,370
what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can for their own personal</font>

294
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,580
gain I think it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

295
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">look to the experts that have always</font>

296
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,140
influenced you with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other decisions and</font>

297
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,270
you have certain influences some of you

298
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,160
may trust my opinion on some of this

299
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,990
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not here to tell you about</font>

300
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,420
which way to vote just thoughts<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've had</font>

301
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,590
on this issue but someone who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font>

302
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,470
huge influence on my life because a lot

303
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,090
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he writes about echoes my own</font>

304
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,130
experiences with being a youtuber for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

305
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">years seeing what the internet can do</font>

306
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,930
for unifying people across borders

whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> be free charity work like</font>

308

name's jeremy rifkin and he's actually

<font color="#CCCCCC">working with the German Chancellor on</font>

creating a an economy that is based on

renewable energies and things like that

314
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,480
and

315
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,639
he wrote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> book which is my Bible I mean</font>

316
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,620
it's big enough to be one and it's

317
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,899
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the empathic civilization the</font>

318

race to global consciousness in a world

319
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,209
in crisis and I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to quickly</font>

320
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,220
summarize one of the main points in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

321
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,430
book he talks about global empathy and

322
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">the history of mankind and how empathy</font>

323
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,430
has evolved over the centuries he starts

324
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,430
off with hunter-gatherers communication

325
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,079
only reached as far as we could shout

326
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,500
and therefore our empathy reached as far

327
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,810
as blood ties if there was someone who

328
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,370
was living at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side of a</font>

329

mountain they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the other they</font>

330
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be the alien</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person we had to</font>

331
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,810
be cautious<font color="#CCCCCC"> of we can trust them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

332
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,910
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years blood ties became</font>

333
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,980
religious ties we had massive

334
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,000
communities where people identified

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,230
commonalities with those who practice

336
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,149
the same religion so we had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jewish</font>

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,839
communities<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian Muslim and then</font>

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,579
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> industrial revolution the</font>

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:21,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">Agricultural Revolution we then have</font>

national identities France Germany the

United Kingdom<font color="#CCCCCC"> and jeremy's point in the</font>

342
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,089
book is if we've made it this far we've

343
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:30,860
gone from the hunter-gatherers<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose</font>

344
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,240
empathy early stretch as far as they

345
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,600
could shout to religious ties and now to

346
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,750
national identities why can't that

347
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,399
transcend to a higher level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a global</font>

348
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,819
empathic civilization and for me that is

349
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:47,750
such an important point and as I

350
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned earlier in this video there</font>

351
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to be a lot of technological</font>

352
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,699
changes that going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in in</font>

353
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next 10 15 20 years that are going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to change the way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are connected</font>

355
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,260
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be real-time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> translation so</font>

356
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,449
we can speak across languages whether

357
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:04,839
it's the way that we're able to become

358
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,910
prosumers where we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all producing and</font>

359
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,360
taking from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital system with really</font>

360
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,490
printing and things like that automated

361
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,319
transport which will take us away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

362
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:19,370
an ownership economy to one that is just

363
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,510
around access the shared economy these

364
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,880
are big changes but when these big

365
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,010
changes happen it means there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

366
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,390
be a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> volatility and my concern is</font>

367
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:32,880
at

368
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,400
this moment in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> although I've been</font>

369
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,770
someone who has wanted us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave the</font>

370
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,800
EU in the past I think even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

371
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,020
referendum seemed like it was going to

372
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,630
be cooled I was like I can't wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

373
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,790
to vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell I've really thought about</font>

374
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,360
this hard and I've realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font>

375
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,100
those that are in charge at the moment

376
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not just talking about the</font>

377
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,410
Conservatives I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

378
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">political class and establish</font>

379
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,920
establishment as a whole there's a

380
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,600
political power struggle going on in the

381
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,970
world and different power structures

382
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,730
keep each other in check and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

383
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's an important thing to maintain</font>

384
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,440
until technology connects us all on a

385
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,240
whole new<font color="#CCCCCC"> level where grassroots efforts</font>

386
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,880
have more influence and bottom-up

387
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">policymaking becomes more prevalent and</font>

388
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,030
so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's kind of I am a brexit ER</font>

389
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,160
in many ways but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think now is</font>

390
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,910
the right time and so tomorrow and I'm

391
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,190
literally a few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I was for</font>

392
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,230
brexit a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days before that it was for</font>

393
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,240
staying in I have been jumping over the

394
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,680
fence many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

395
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,140
annoyed with how our governments have

396
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,090
used the EU to scapegoat their own

397
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision-making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think there's been</font>

398
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,850
just a lot of dishonesty overall also

399
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,500
when having a referendum where it's

400
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,430
around 50 50 I think that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

401
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,790
concerning time to make such a drastic

402
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,199
decision however<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're so on who is</font>

403
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,569
voting to leave I tightly respect that

404
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,119
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally understand the many</font>

405
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,310
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing that I'm just</font>

406
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,109
explaining that I think in the long run

407
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,939
and in terms of the technological

408
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,829
changes we're about to see I think we're

409
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,510
too early for doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that we</font>

410
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,250
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just hold our breaths a bit</font>

411
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,650
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my hope is that if we do stay</font>

412
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,630
in there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a lot more focus</font>

413
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,240
on how the EU works I think the EU is

414
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,360
going to feel a lot more under the

415
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,550
spotlight than it is now and hopefully

416
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,340
it will cause for more activism and more

417
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,250
bottom up participation where we can

418
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,280
actually

419
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,920
inject a lot more accountability into

420
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,680
the political and economic system that

421
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,170
is currently at play so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate</font>

422
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,900
this was a bit of a ramble but I just

423
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,080
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make some thoughts clear that</font>

424
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,800
I will be voting remain and if you have

425
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,380
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vote tomorrow use it whatever way</font>

426
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,450
you choose so thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> listening I</font>

427
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,800
really look forward to hearing your

428
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,110
thoughts in the comments please be

429
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,300
respectful of one another and a DA<font color="#E5E5E5"> till</font>

430
00:18:18,300 --> 00:00:00,000
next time
