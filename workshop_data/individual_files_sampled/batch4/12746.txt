what was wonderful last night as CNN holds what do they call it a town hall it was a lynch mob a lynch mob of people all of whom agreed and if you don't think all of them agreed let's start with the crowd okay they start talking about a assault right no it's semi-automatic bands I think they're talking about and the crowd goes nuts just listen these are two instances spliced together cut five but solutions like getting the assault rifles off the streets start looking at how easy it is to get around it you would literally have a ban every semi-automatic rifle they're enough that's what fair enough that's a first of all you know this is so dishonest not only is the crowd packed but they're ignorant a semi-automatic I'm not even a gun guy but I know the semi-automatic all that means is when you pull the trigger it reloads so you don't have to you know that would leave Winchester 76 is that's what you'd be using like Jimmy Stewart in an old western you'd be cocking the gun every time and maybe maybe they want you to stuff they like the the revolutionary soldiers to stuff the Gunpowder and with a rod you know it's ignorant that's never going to happen so why are they cheering why are they cheering that because they don't know what a semi-automatic is because they were pulled off the street they were selected to do just what you saw them doing and how do we know that because there's one kid who wouldn't go on Colton hab was a ROTC kid at the school shooting in Florida he used their Kevlar mats to protect students he was a hero kid he wanted to go on and talk about what he wanted to talk about but no and this is the local channel 10 reporting on this on Colton Happ we just refused to do their scripted routine expected to be able to ask my questions and give my opinion on my questions but Colton hobb a member of the Junior ROTC who's shielded classmates in the midst of terror says he did not get to share his experience CNN had originally asked me to write a speech in questions and it ended up being all scripted Colton wrote questions about school safety suggested using veterans as armed school security guards but claims CNN wanted him to ask a scripted question instead so he decided not to go I don't think that it's gonna get anything accomplished it's not gonna ask the true questions that all the parents and teachers and students have so so who do they get of course they get all these activist kids and they behaved despicably now the thing is I get it they're emotional they're out of control they're they don't know what they're talking about so why are they on TV and they are on TV because CNN is practicing a form of child abuse called using traumatized kids to sell your political position it's a terrible thing to do it's an immoral thing to do
