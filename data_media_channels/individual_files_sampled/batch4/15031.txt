Peter strux congressional testimony was an insult to America Wow I watched that hearing yesterday Peter struck the ask raced FBI agent who of course sent his mistress fifty thousand text messages many of which were negative about Donald Trump hateful festival about Donald Trump even admitted under oath that he was rooting for Hillary Clinton innovate under oath yesterday that he was rooting for Hillary Clinton and detested his word Donald Trump hearest rocks a horrible horrible guy terrible guy but a couple of takeaways from the hearing number one the Democrats proved themselves to be the world's worst obstruction it the initial standoff between House Judiciary Committee Chairman Republican Bob Goodlatte and ranking Democratic member on the committee Jerrold Nadler from New York was disgraceful with Nadler running interference and essentially telling America Peter struck and every other witness brought before Congress that even under congressional subpoena you don't have to answer questions there's nothing Congress can do Nadler companies off of his own did a legislative body yesterday it was terrible it was terrible another take away with strokes defiance and arrogance and now stroke would be defiant to Republicans but not to Democrats well that came back to bite him in the butt when he decided to answer questions about ongoing investigations for Democrats Sheila jackson-lee right at the end of the first session before they went to the lunch break when he answered questions for Democrats Sheila Jackson Lee about things for which he wouldn't answer Republicans questions well the Republicans weren't having it so during that break representative trey Gowdy got in touch with the FBI and found out that struck could in fact answer questions about how many interviews were conducted for robert muller during certain time periods but what his truck do at that point after refusing to answer them in the first session even though he was under subpoena he said he wasn't believe was he claimed he didn't know who they didn't have time to go get the information and he was openly defiant and arrogant and rude but then again started answering questions for Democrats one of the best moments came when representative Louie Gohmert from Texas decided say to Strock what America wanted said to Strock why you know paraphrase why should we believe you with that smirk on your face you've probably the same smirk on your face when you were laying in bed looking at your wife of course referring to the fact that we found all this out about shock because he was having an extramarital affair with FBI lawyer Lisa Paige now at least a paid assassin is set to testify today and a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill which is exactly why Democrats and Peter Strock were making those ridiculous motions you have stocks closed-door testimony to Congress released the reason they wanted to do that it's illegal and investigative tactic they wanted to be able to have Lisa page get access to that information to prepare for her testimony this morning to make sure that she and Strock were on the same page that she didn't say anything under oath and he said under oath and vice-versa now I release a page I would simply plead the fifth there's nothing that can be done the Lisa page Lisa page is no longer an FBI employee she can't be fired and she's not being accused of anything criminal texting your boyfriend behind your husband's back and hating on a political candidate isn't illegal it's improper it's unethical what they were doing was immoral but none of it's illegal so from a legal standpoint lisa page has no downside to going before congress today in the closed-door meeting and saying I plead the fifth I plead the fifth I plead the fifth who wouldn't not a damn thing anyone can do to her he's not suspected of anything criminal not under investigation for anything criminal it's her constitutional right to do so right frankly should be stupid to do anything else but yesterday really really highlighted a bigger issue Democrats really are a partisan hacks they don't care about transparency they don't care about justice they care about a police state in which federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are weaponized help certain political candidates over others that's the stuff of or well that's soviet-era communist Russia that's Romania 1968 that's not America that not America but America saw this America saw what happened yesterday and I truly truly believe what happened yesterday hurt DOJ FBI jeff Sessions Christopher Rea know the DOJ and FBI have no leadership Jeff Sessions has to go Christopher ray has to go rod Rosenstein has to go but more importantly it really hurt the credibility of the Democratic Party they were seeing yesterday even by moderate and conservative Democrats as obstructionist hacks that care less about justice and more about partisan politics we're gonna be following the developments which struck and Paige we talked about it a lot more on Monday and we're gonna be talking about this quite a bit on Monday on my live show my new live show on the rebels YouTube channel the classified live
