in order to enter in the dictionary it needs to meet three criteria my name is Corey Stamper I am a lexicographer at merriam-webster a lexicographer is a person who writes and edits dictionaries the first criterion is a need to have widespread use so it has to have use in all sorts of places both tonally and geographically so we want to see something appear in the Wall Street Journal and vibe magazine for instance or something that shows up in California and the Midwest sustained use is the second criterion that means that a word has to have a shelf life it needs to be around for a long enough time that we know it's not just a blip in the language because there are lots of words that kind of come and go in the language and weirdly enough when you enter a word into the dictionary people tend to use it more so you want to make sure that it's actually in the language and then the third criterion is it has to have meaningful use which means it has to have a meaning that lexicographers can actually grab a hold of and that sounds stupid because all words have meaning but there are a handful of words that get used in print mostly as examples of long words or as nonsense words that don't actually have a lexical meaning I can't write a meaning for antidisestablishmentarianism for instance because nobody uses in this sentence the way that we find new words is through reading we pretty much read everything in print from anywhere the goal is to use sources that are written published and professionally edited that's changing a little bit in the Internet age what we look for now is major sources for lots of different places so we read magazines newspapers blogs trade journals books I've read fiber boxes and frozen food cartons and beer bottles it has print on it we read it and what we're doing when we read is we're looking for words that catch our eye now usually those are new words but sometimes that's a new meaning of an old word and when we find that we kind of slurp it into a database and each of those little bits of information is called a citation and patience are the raw material that we use when defining a word in the dictionary
