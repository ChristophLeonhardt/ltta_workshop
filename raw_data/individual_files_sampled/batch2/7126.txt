Paul Ryan has decided that maybe just maybe it's time to update the house dress code this was a story last week involving an unidentified journalist who claimed that she was kicked out of the chamber because of the fact that she was wearing a sleeveless dress well that sparked the debate about the dress code that is decades old and now Paul Ryan says I don't know like maybe it's time to update it a little bit so let me give you the details the current guidelines allow the house search Sergent at arms and members of chamber security to restrict access to staff and visitors not wearing appropriate business attire but they don't define what business attire is exactly what constitutes appropriate business attire is not clearly stated and so it kind of allows people to go ahead and kick mostly women out for nonsense right a lot of women wear power dresses business attire that is sleeveless and that's just modern times so there's the part that people are under playing is driving me crazy you're not allowed to have open-toed shoes like why why what is that from like the 1800s or to get that boy I don't care so I would roll my eyes at that as well but I don't know it just I don't know really that's not even a thing I realized was an etiquette thing I had no idea like Peter gross let's keep no no no no so look if you that's why this is totally sexist it's not my intention but by effect because which male reporter or staffer is gonna come in a sleeveless shirt it's for buzz beers what are gonna wear like a wife beater to Congress right it's almost only going to not almost it's only going to apply to women and the open-toed thing which nasty dudes gonna show up and you know yeah and whatever you show up with flip-flops or whatever it took Congress but women wear dress shoes that show their feet all the time most formal settings I'm just saying that in my list of priorities regarding what I would want to change about the stress code the open toed shooting is the least of my concern right I mean it doesn't bother me either way so that's just just my honest take on it now here's what Paul Ryan has to say about it he says in regard to the dress code this is nothing new and certainly not something that I devised at the same time that doesn't mean that enforcement couldn't stand to be a bit modernised decorum this is my favorite part oh my favorite part decorum is important especially for this institution and a dress code in the chamber in the lobby makes sense okay let's just stop right there come back to us decorum is important like I I just love that they're talking about etiquette while they rob us blind right we get together and talk about how to violate your freedoms how to give tax cuts and loopholes to the richest people in the country how to screw over the most disadvantaged but we just want to make sure that you cover up your arms ladies proper decorum go fuck yourself but you are right I mean they start wars they're they they don't need to start I mean people die let alone healthcare let alone the tax cuts you know the top point one percent are going to get and nine hundred and forty thousand dollar tax cut meanwhile your taxes might go up okay but he's worried about decorum no decorum decorum the core okay the man that you supported who is currently the President of the United States bragged about grabbing women by the pussy and moving in on them like a bitch I'm not gonna hurt like a bitch and then he said no that's somebody else okay look I don't know why that part of his quote annoyed me but it's just like this fake properness right like let's all pretend like we're proper while we're robbing the American people no no but that you you're absolutely right though because that is one of the core issues in Washington you can do and pass the most horrific policies that's totally okay but if you are impolite to someone else in the elites that is considered unacceptable that's the thing that'll get you railroaded straight out of Washington he was impolite to one of the elites how could he decorum has been broken what didn't you guys get it you passed the resolution to get us in the Iraq war and didn't several hundred thousand civilians die because of that yes but we didn't break the quorum while we were doing it I mean God god forbid you should we should see your arms while we're voting for horrific things and finally my randoms no doubt it is this is a look in the lobby we've got to make sure that there's the court well how are you gonna get to your office without passing through the lobby so if any rule that applies to the lobby applies to the whole building so why bother making that stupid distinction because they can't help themselves they're like oh I'm gonna do a loophole here it's just so dumb anyway look I I it's important to dress professionally right and present yourself professionally but these outdated dress codes drive me absolutely nuts help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
