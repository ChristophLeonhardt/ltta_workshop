TOOLS TO HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH. Neil: THANKS, PAM. GOOD CATCHING UP WITH YOU. THANK YOU. YOU TOO, NEIL. Neil: NOT ONLY ISRAEL BUT WE'VE BEEN TIGHTENING PROTECTION AND SECURITIES THROUGHOUT THE REGION HERE. EXPECTATIONS ARE MORE VIOLENT OR INSTABILITY IN THE DAYS, WEEKS, SOME SAY THE MONTHS AHEAD. ISRAELI SPECIAL FORCES, AARON COHN. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. IT'S A SENSE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE VIOLENCE BUT WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF PROTECTING OUR EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM BUT ELSEWHERE, LOCATIONS ELSE WHERE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. YEAH, NEIL. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME. LISTEN, ISRAEL HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAIRLY GOOD COUNTRY AND A TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD AND SECURITY NOT ONLY HAS BEEN THE UTMOST CONCERN FOR ISRAELI CIVILIANS THE LAST 60 YEARS BUT OBVIOUSLY FOR OUR EMBASSIES AS WELL. AS FAR AS PROTECTIONS, WE HAVE THE U.S. MARINES TASKED WITH PROTECTING U.S. EMBASSIES ABROAD. WITH THE EMBASSY MOVING TO JERUSALEM, IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE U.S. MARINE CORPS HAS BOLSTERED THE ACTUAL MANPOWER AT THAT EMBASSY. THEY WEREN'T VERY CLOSE TO THE ISRAELI SECRET SERVICES IN ISRAEL. THEY'VE HAD A REALLY STRONG RELATIONSHIP OVER THE PAST DECADE. BUT FROM WHAT I'M HEARING, THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO STAY INCREASED UNTIL ALL OF THE HYPE OF THIS MOVE FINALLY DOES KIND OF RUN ITS CORES. THERE'S MANPOWER WITH THE NEW EMBASSY. THE MOVE IS BEING FINALIZED. Neil: WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROTECTING FACILITIES, ISRAEL OR ELSEWHERE, ANY TIME THERE'S AN INCIDENT, THE FEAR OF A SPREAD OF INCIDENTS AND WE BEEF OF COMPOUNDS AND WE DID IN BENGHAZI RAID THAT KILLED OUR U.S. AMBASSADOR, BUT IT DOESN'T LAST FOREVER. SECURITY IS BEEFED UP SHORT OF ANOTHER INCIDENT OCCURRING. IT'S ALL SO SCALED DOWN. WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE SECURITY EXPERTS TO DO? WELL, I'M SURE THE ISRAELIS ARE ADVISING THE U.S. SECURITY FORCES IN THAT PARTICULAR REGION. THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE WE'RE PROVIDING ISRAEL IS PROVIDING AMERICANS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE AND ALWAYS HAS. WE'VE HAD AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP IN THE U.S. WITH ISRAEL'S FBI. IF I WAS ADVISING THE U.S., I WOULD SAY HEAVIER LEAN ON THE ISRAELIS IN TERMS OF ACTUAL INFORMATION. SECURITY KIND OF IT'S A LEAVING, BREATHING, ORGANIC SOMETHING THAT GETS STAFFED UP AS THREATS INCREASE AND CAN BE PEELED BACK OR SCALED DOWN. ISRAEL IS A BIG FAN OF THE PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY. SORT OF LOOKING WHERE NO ONE CAN SEE THAT SECURITY AGENT. SO I WOULD BE BOLSTERING THE PLANE CLOTHES ELEMENT IN AND AROUND THE EMBASSY, MULTILAYERING IT WITH THE WAY THE ISRAELIS DO. THEY ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS MANPOWER BY SPACING THEM OUT CLEVERLY. SO I THINK THE PLAIN CLOTHED APPARATUS COMBINED WITH REALLY GOOD INTEL ABOUT THREATS BEING MADE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW AREA IN JERUSALEM. IT'S A DIFFERENT LOCATION NOW. SO GETTING EXTREMELY INTIMATE WITH THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION, THE CROSS STREETS AND JUST PUSHING THE EYES OUT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND THE SURVEILLANCE OUT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE ACTUAL EMBASSY SO YOU CAN SEE AS FAR OUT AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN AGAIN, MULTILAYERING IT WITH GOOD INTEL. I THINK THE AMERICANS WILL BE IN GOOD HANDS. I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE ANYTHING LIKE A BENGHAZI, ESPECIALLY IN JERUSALEM WITH THE SECURITY COMBINATION THERE.
