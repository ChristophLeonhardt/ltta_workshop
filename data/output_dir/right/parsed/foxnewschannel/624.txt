>> IN WHAT COULD BE A STEP
IN FULL ANYTHING A
COMMITMENT MADE BY KIM JONG
UN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP SIX
WEEKS AGO AT THEIR HISTORIC
SUMMIT, NEW SATELLITE IMAGES
APPEAR TO SHOW NORTH KOREA
DISMANTLING ITS MAIN MISSILE
TESTING SITE.
SO, IS THIS A TRUE SIGN OF
PROGRESS ON DENUKING THE
COUNTRY?
HERE TO WEIGH IN FOX NEWS
NATIONAL SECURITY STRAT GIST
AND FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT
TO THE PRESIDENT
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.
SEBASTIAN, GOOD MORNING TO
YOU.
>> GOOD MORNING, STEVE.
STEVE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THE FACT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY ARE PULLING THE PLUG ON
THAT FACILITY?
>> IF THE REPORTS ARE TRUE
IF THE SATELLITE IMAGES
AREN'T BEING INTERPRETED
CORRECTLY, IT'S VERY
SIGNIFICANT THESE ACTIONS
THIS IS POST THE SINGAPORE
SUMMIT.
THIS HAS TO BE A TANGIBLE
DECISION BY KIM.
THE BUREAU.
THE YOU WERE ECHELONS OF THE
NORTH KOREAN REGIME WHICH
WOULD BE PART OF THE
CONCRETE FOLLOW-UP TO THAT
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, ONE OF
THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT HAS
HAPPENED SINCE SINGAPORE IS
THE CANCELLATION OF THE
ANNUAL ANTI-AMERICAN PARADE
BY PYONGYANG BECAUSE THAT'S
A VERY PUBLIC THING.
THE PEOPLE HAVE EXPECTATIONS
FOR THAT IDEOLOGY LADEN
EVENT.
THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY
STOPPED IT THEY SUSPENDED
THAT PARADE.
THIS IS THE BRASS TAX.
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL WHEN
IT COMES TO NORTH KOREA'S
CAPABILITY TO LAUNCH
BALLISTIC MISSILES.
STEVE: I WOULD IMAGINE THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES IS FRUSTRATED THAT
THE PACE OF THE DENUKING IS
SO SLOW.
AND SO THAT'S WHY YESTERDAY
WHEN THE NEWS WAS MAYBE THEY
ARE PULLING THE PLUG ON THAT
SITE MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD
SOMETHING.
>> YEAH.
I HAVE USED PHRASE OFTEN
HE MOVES AT THE SPEED OF
TRUMP.
USED TO HERE IN THE SWAMP.
YOU LOOK AT THE LAST YEAR
AND A HALF.
THE THINGS THAT HE HAS
ACHIEVED IN JUST A YEAR AND
A HALF MOST PRESIDENTS WOULD
BE HAPPY WITH.
AFTER 8 YEARS IN OFFICE.
BUT, YES, I THINK AS A
BUSINESSMAN, WHO IS RESULTS
ORIENTED, IS HE PROBABLY A
LITTLE FRUSTRATED.
BUT, IN TERMS OF
INTERNATIONAL DEALS, ON ARMS
CONTROL, THIS IS PRETTY
FAST, ACTUALLY, STEVE.
KANSAS CITY AT THE VFW
CONVENTION WHEN TALKING
ABOUT IRAN NOW, HE SAID, YOU
KNOW, THAT COUNTRY IS
NOW WE ARE READY TO MAKE A
DEAL.
NOT LIKE THE LAST DEAL THE
ARE WE GETTING CLOSER?
FROM THE IRANIANS AND THEN
GOING BACK TOWARD THE
PRESIDENT?
>> I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT'S
HOW YOU TALK TO
DICTATORSHIPS.
LANGUAGE AND FANCY MEETINGS
IN GENEVA OR VIENNA.
YOU HIT THEM HARD AND TALK
STRAIGHT TO THEM.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS
SIGNALING IN HIS GREAT
SPEECH YESTERDAY, HE
UNDERSTANDS HOW FRAGILE THIS
REGIME IS.
THE LOUDER THEY BARK, THE
WEAKER THEY ARE.
YOU LOOK AT THE
DEMONSTRATIONS, THE
DEMONSTRATIONS IN IRAN NOW,
UNLIKE 2009, WHEN WE HAD THE
REVOLUTION.
THEY ARE NOT JUST CENTERED
AROUND TEHRAN.
THEY ARE ALL AROUND THE
COUNTRY.
THIS IS THE TIME TO SQUEEZE
THEM.
STEVE: ALL RIGHT.
