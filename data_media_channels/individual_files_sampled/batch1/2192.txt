researchers at Rutgers recruited depressed and non depressed student volunteers at the start depressed volunteers showed brain activity associated with poor concentration and focus which could lead to dwelling on bad thoughts the volunteers underwent a supervised program they counted their breaths for 20 minutes and tried not to let their thoughts wander this was followed by 10 minutes of slow walking focusing on each footstep in 30 minutes of aerobic exercise after eight weeks the depressed groups off 40% reduction in depression symptoms and the brain activity associated with poor concentration and focus had improved to be nearly identical to the non depressed group the non depressed group also self-reported feeling happier study lead dr. alderman theorizes that exercise most likely increased the activity in the part of the brain that controls focus and meditation helped keep the neurons alive it is worth noting that the study did have a small sample size and it didn't follow volunteers over the long term to see if positive effects continued
