I have max keiser this as the Kaiser report so much to talk about Stacy max we've been traveling quite a lot Miami Los Angeles now back to North Carolina was kind of cold there's not a lot happening we've had the Tide Pods situation brought a pod with me no yeah brother Todd pods in case during the show I need to eat Matt iPod as part of this type pod revolution millennial phenomenon now that's the problem with news is that it seems like this whole you know the fact is what happened with Tide Pods is that some elderly people with dementia ate some of those and they passed away but they ate that because they had dementia but the news covered the story and therefore a lot of young people apparently thought it was a good idea to try it themselves yeah I mean not even in that film idiocracy are the people so deranged as to start eating this type of cleaning product I remember they try to water their lawns with Gatorade that didn't work out very well but to just eat chemicals like this because they are brightly colored seems like a complete collapse of society there used to be a saying when I was little my mom would say I'm gonna wash your mouth out with soap now the Millennials are just eating Tide Pods to cleanse their entire system of all biological organic material and replace it with some kind of industrial chemical material I'm not however is so gross that's gross yeah oh my god it came in the wrapper tastes like something licking the bottom of a diesel engine I'm not sure it's not totally a fortune hoax this story but nevertheless there's also been a story of the flamethrowers you know Elon Musk has sold four million dollars worth of flamethrowers all right flip throws I don't know you know he's been on Twitter and he's been talking about flamethrowers and selling flamethrowers and selling baseball caps and doing all sorts of crazy stuff tweeting about zombie apocalypse isn't he's trying to defeat the zombies so he's selling flamethrowers as a good zombie deterrent now some concerned people are trying to get regulators to stop them from selling flamethrowers they're saying it's dangerous but French I can't talk anymore because my mouth is salivating in response to this incredible then flux of chemicals I don't not to do it somebody had me go get some water yeah while they get some water I will read this first headline here these are the six traders who are just arrested for manipulating the gold market on Monday morning we reported here at Zero Hedge that a number of traders currently or formerly employed by UBS HSBC and Deutsche Bank as usual no JP Morgan US banks were touched would be perp walked and charged in an unprecedented cross-agency crackdown between the CFTC DOJ and FBI seeking to punish spoof errs of Futures this was confirmed moments ago by a CFTC press release which announced criminal and civil enforcement actions against three banks and six individuals involved in commodities fraud and spoofing schemes so Deutsche Bank is to pay thirty million dollars UBS is to pay fifteen million dollars and HSBC is to pay 1.5 million dollars to settle these spoofing futures in the gold and silver markets right well we've talked about this for ten years that these banks manipulate the price of gold and silver as a way to keep the dollar buoyant and keep the focus on the dollar and everyone argued that this was a not possible because for every bar there's a cellar but in the world of naked futures and spoofing that's not true and now it's come out to these banks for manipulating the gold price and it's still going on by the way I mean this is just a slap on the wrist for a few banks that are engaged in manipulation but they're the schemes continue and the price is continuing to be suppressed in this way and but people don't want to believe it because they have a cult-like following of fiat money in the US dollar you and I on here on the Kaiser report have covered over and over the fact that we've had several people on who show you live as is happening the spoofing happening and spoofing is creating the illusion that actual trades are happening and getting you know basically triggering stop-loss orders and things like that to force people to dump their gold or silver it seems to mostly happen downward pressure downward but here we have these banks being charged with civil manipulation HSBC again these are basically these alleged crimes that they're now paying fines for they happened up until 2014 for those keeping count this is roughly the fourth time HSBC has been found guilty of manipulating markets after the bank nearly lost its Charter and swore it would never manipulate markets again remember you and I ran into Eric Holder at Washington DC a airport Ronald Reagan Airport and we confronted him about this and and he insisted to us that you know that they this was a suitable punishment for them that paying the fines would teach them a lesson and they wouldn't manipulate markets anymore but this is happening in these particular cases up until 2014 2015 so still happening ongoing well it's part of their deferred prosecution agreement when they record laundering money for a Mexican drug cartels they are not allowed to commit any kind of fraud or manipulation without losing their license so now they've done it four times and they continue to have a license so there's no law if you are in the banking industry there's no law that applies to you you can just steal money with reckless abandon and that's the bottom line now one of the guys arrested was actually he had his firm in Chicago had devised an algorithm for the other guy arrested a few years ago in London who had been charged with causing the flash crash because he was spoofing SP futures and the mini contracts and this company in Chicago had devised the algorithm for him and they got off at that time they were not charged with anything because they said we you know we only designed an algorithm to this guy specifications we didn't do anything illegal with it but apparently that firm has then saw that they created that algorithm and said why don't we use this and they started rigging markets as well oh yeah I mean so it's illegal to have a flame thrower in let's say a delivery room for babies or something like that so it's illegal to have algorithms to steal money which is what these algorithms do but because they're done in the way that makes certain folks some money they ignore it because the law doesn't apply to them and we live in a two-tier society there's laws that apply to the masses and then there's no laws for these folks and that's clear anyway so that stories happened we've been covering it for years here's the CFTC and the likes of these guys DOJ and FBI were concerned about crypto currencies and whether or not they're transparent enough and yet here these allegedly very transparent markets gold silver they were very transparent and two traders that we've interviewed here like Andrew Maguire who showed you on screen the spoofing happening and yet people still refuse to believe that transparent spoofing happening and nevertheless so a lot of people have moved into cryptocurrency because they feel like well perhaps that you know this is a market that is not controlled by UBS and HSBC and Deutsche Bank who go golfing with the president and the you know Attorney General and therefore always get off from these crimes they never charged with these crimes maybe some you know like minions that's the low guys in the totem pole get arrested as in this case in the six traders who were arrested and are being charged criminally in the gold and silver market manipulation so we're moving to this next headline here more than 1 million people sign up for early access to Robin Hood's new crypto trading service no fee stock trading app Robin Hood announced Thursday it was rolling out commission free trading and digital currencies Bitcoin in aetherium beginning in February although the service will initially only be available in just five states within one day after that announcement hundreds of thousands of people had indicated they wanted to be notified about early access to crypto currency trading so 78% of the users of this app 78% are between 18 and 35 years old they're Millennials they they want to they're pouring into this app in order to have access to cryptocurrency trading it's only allowed in California Massachusetts Missouri Montana New Hampshire first and then it'll roll out across the rest of the United States but it looks pretty big news yeah it's amazing you have a over a million and it's just those five states so if Robin Hood was available in all 50 states we're saying well you know that would be 1020 million people would be signing up for this which is an enormous amount of people and cryptocurrencies that really caught the imagination of this generation that is rejecting the old-school model of banking and they like the center ship resistance of cryptocurrency and the individual sovereignty that it brings so this is part of the new generation a lot of people are saying the likes of coin base should be worried because this is a developed app that is already in existence this Robin Hood app is what Millennials have been using to trade stocks okay now there it's also it's already something they're using to trade stocks and now they could trade cryptocurrencies but you know the news in the past week as well has been that this exchange in Japan was hacked of some cryptocurrencies 400 over 400 million u.s. dollars worth of currency and then these three young guys these three young Japanese guys came out and had the press conference and announced that they would give cash on hand back to these people four hundred million dollars worth which is a huge surprise because I hadn't even heard of the exchange we've been around and cryptocurrency sector for a long time and yet they made enough money to have four hundred million dollars on hand to reimburse people who had cryptocurrency stolen all right well the other markets capital o is worth five to six hundred billion and that just happened the last few years and they other VC funded entities that are on the periphery or with another half a billion to a trillion so there's a lot of cash out there there's a lot of cash out there and then I want to front turn to this headline about those same sort of Millennials now pouring in to the stock market it's a tweet amazing retail trading activity is going parabolic explains a lot this is a chart showing trading activity at retail focus brokerages is skyrocketing the gray line on the top is sp500 but look at that blue line that's going parabolic even more than the market and that's a trade TD Ameritrade and as a percentage of the new york stock exchange trades Hester see those are all the young kids those are Millennials especially retail the dumb money pouring into the stock market at all-time highs yeah well you know markets go to way so it'll be interesting to see how this generation deals with the correction and we can easily see a 50 percent correction in markets across the board and the bond market looks you know pretty weak and we'll see how this group deals with that I'm curious to see how they handle it now in the second half we have a tremendous more amount of information to cover so don't go away stay right there we'll be right back after these words welcome back to the Kaiser a porter Max Keiser place what what what's it what hey max so in the first half we ended with talking about the Robin Hood apps in the United States offering to five states within the United States mostly to their clients who are a millennial 78% of them are 18 to 35 years old they're signing up in the millions in order to get early access to cryptocurrency trading so this could see an evolution in the maturation of the cryptocurrency market people are going bonkers for cryptocurrency in the virtual space but also in the real world this is bleeding over into the real world this is an interesting story that hasn't got much attention in the cryptocurrency world which I suspect means that some of our friends are actually maybe behind this and this is the Tesla effect Tahoe Reno industrial park almost out of land after 74 thousand acre sale the Tahoe Reno industrial center billed as the largest industrial park in North America is nearly out of land about 74,000 acres which is a hundred and fifteen square miles of the park east of Sparks Nevada was recently sold for about one hundred and seventy five million dollars t.ri partner broker Lance Gilman said on Nevada newsmakers the biggest buyer was blocked chains LLC and they say there's some blockchain company they've bought a hundred and fifteen square miles in Nevada right next to Elon Musk's five billion dollar Tesla battery factory what's going on well according to the developers and sellers of this land that the biggest buyer was blockchains la see which is at the forefront of one of the most revolutionary innovations since the advent of the internet blockchain distributors what would I be doing with all those laughs well according to the developer Gilman he says quote block chains will be a city within itself so right so they're creating a a sovereign state within that state is their seceding from the world using their own currency it's gonna be at their own world it's gonna be bloc world we don't know nobody knows who these people are behind blockchains LLC it's a mystery it could just be one of these companies that adds blockchains to its name in order to add value could just be like but it's a private company it's exactly they're not getting any halo effect there's no bump they're creating a nation within a nation unless it's next to Tesla where they get the battery power they've got to go off the power grid they're gonna have their own blockchain their own governance it's gonna be a nation within a nation what state is this again it's in Nevada Nevada and so according to Gillman the property developer who sold this 115 square miles to a company called blockchains LLC he said so think of this in terms of residential project that could be 4,000 housing units and apartments along with the shopping a full cybernetic community based on the blockchain theory and technology they pick up a huge amount of property along the freeway interstate 80 for what I would call freeway visible retail and that would include everything from hotels truck stops and restaurants again all with a blockchain technology foundation so okay so so that this could be a development of like a whole community all the inputs and outputs the the housing shopping health care and obviously Nevada they'll have gambling and whatnot so oh it's gonna be an attempt to create a blockchain enabled community nation within the state of Nevada again it's 100% speculation because all we have is as you could see from this guy he doesn't really know that much about blockchain and that the fact that he thinks you're gonna advertise it along the interstate freeway but I'm thinking is either somebody trying to sell flip condos and they think adding blockchain to it will add premium just like people had blockchain to their name like Kodak does or you know Long Island iced tea as blockchain to their name and their stock price soars it could be something like that or it could be the fact that it is next to Tesla it could be Elon Musk he is always talking about block and flamethrowers it could be Nevada is a 0% interest 0% income tax state it could be the libertarian sorts who are in Nevada already somebody like tres mayor he's like all these sort of people there are many many thousands of Pete Rose mayor's in Nevada thousands and thousands of people within Bitcoin or libertarian sorts perhaps it is a sovereign nation that they're building they're building a labral land in Nevada anyway nevertheless I thought it was interesting it's darn interesting because it means the US government will be challenged from Nevada I very much doubt it because even sovereign nations of like Navajo Nation or Sunni Lakota Nation they have no sovereignty even though they can't take their own money they try to Lakota coin a silver coin but this is like gonna have their own mint the Nevada you know crypto coin and new Libre land in Nevada next to the Texel of battery factory it could challenge this Federal Reserve Bank nevertheless this new sort of world of dreamers from Elon Musk dreaming of these Tesla's and Hyperloop sand going to the Mars to the open possibility of what you can do with a cryptocurrency and create a new economy it seems to be driving some sort of investment and movement in Nevada in this new world who knows they could be developing at their own city within a city states yes many people say that's what the future is a city states we're going back to the city state which would of course make sense if we're in a neo feudal world to have city-states but on top of that we have while the West is reverting maybe to city-states I wanted to also call your attention to another story that while we were basking in the Sun in Miami and Los Angeles there was another story that happened that also got zero attention in the US media in fact this headline is from the BBC but this has got zero attention in the US because of course they're a focused on conspiracy theories on most of the news here and gossip so China to develop Arctic shipping routes opened by global warming China has announced plans to develop shipping Li through the Arctic to become a polar Silk Route Beijing said global warming meant viable shipping routes through the Arctic would become increasingly important for international trade it said China would work with Russia and other Arctic countries to develop the polar route so while China itself kind of stays apart from the global warming protocols on to which all other nations sign up and in the West we have many climate change deniers who are mostly eating Tide Pods I don't know if that goes hand-in-hand I don't know which comes first like are you a global warming denier first and then you start eating Tide Pods or was it eating the Tide Pods that caused you to become a global warming denier that maybe mess with your brain circuitry maybe basically what China is done is the opposite of the opium wars they've sent us these Tide Pods probably I'm assuming they're made in China and they did something to it to entice Westerners to consume them clearly that's happening and as part of their initiative to conquer the globe by destroying this entire generation who's become addicted now to hold a thermogenic laced iPods and we see this really as a continuation of the Jim Jones cult in Guiana remember yet everyone drank kool-aid and there was a mass die-off here they just create pretty little candy like Tide Pods full of hallucinogenic carcinogenic chemicals and of course the Millennials find this irresistible because they were grown up on things like Teletubbies remember that TV show where it's like a walking type odd to saying in a m drivel on TV but hypnotizing the generation to buy into iPhones and other consumer goods that bind them irreparable to the slave mentality of the electronic ghetto and that's where they live and now the Tide Pods aren't really the drug of the electronic ghetto if you've got into any prison system you'll find people getting high on lighter fluid or cleaning fluid or paint chips here this generation that you know trying to get out they actually see Tide Pods as this generations Twinkie you know I had Twinkies when I was a kid and that kind of messed us up with the saturated fat and lard and fake food stuff that that was the synthetic food movement of the era the 70s we went not green but spleen where all the food became essentially garbage so we started the show yeah story about spoofing in the gold and silver futures markets people who cared to look could see it right there on the screen happening this day as plain as day a lot of people said it wasn't real regulators said it wasn't real everybody said it wasn't real nothing happened the same thing here you could see the ice melting by the fact that you could sail ship through of course Russia in the last year or two sail the ship through for the first time without an icebreaker so you could see with your own two eyes that you could say all through but the same sort of people who compose our economy of tide pod eating sort of consumers they will say that's not real so let's not look there in the meantime China of course which is denies its role in the they never sign up to these sort of global protocols to know that we're not of coal there and yet here we see them built planning a polar Silk Road a lot of people say can't happen can't happen can't can't happen I'm gonna eat my Tod pod I'm gonna eat my tide pod I can do that yeah so what's your point there that in other words there's a climate change deniers and meanwhile there's a polar Silk Road being built through the melting icecap so it's obvious that climate change is happening and the world's ecosystem is being irreparable damage and transformed before our very eyes and the u.s. is losing in two ways number one the climate denying is precluding them from participating in this new economy number one and number two the effects of the climate change the weather catastrophes the global you migrants that are the result of it and all these other problems are hurting the US economy on the other side of the trade so you've got a double bind happening from the myopia that comes with failing to see what's in your frickin face that the sea levels are rising the ice caps are melting and the world economy is changing and is favoring those that are not blindly to this blind to this is this is kind of what you're saying there the economy you can deny all you want that manipulation is happening in the futures market you can deny all you want the thought ice is literally melting in front of your freaking eyes and the ships are going through without icebreakers and you know if it if you need to I don't know how many type pods you need to eat to make plucky clucky how many type eyes do you need to eat to be a climate denier 47 look he's not helpless he's a healthy bird look at this healthy bird the tide pot eating hasn't affected plucky's health in one way it one bit plucky where are you been we haven't seen you for a while from London oh my god that's quite a journey well well back to China and the Arctic polar Silk Road China hopes to work with all the parties to build a polar Silk Road through developing the Arctic shipping routes China said and his first official policy paper on the polar region it said every countries rights to use the Arctic shipping routes should be ensured the new route could take 20 days off 248 days it currently takes to get to Rotterdam from China via the Suez Canal so as you see the theme of the show is this notion that you can that although ignoring the proof and evidence ignoring the spoofing in the markets ignoring global warming ignoring the power and awesomeness of cryptocurrency doesn't make all the development happening in the real world go way people are going to take advantage and seize the opportunity that you decide to ignore while playing with plucky or eating Tide Pods well said every Empire kind of crests and then falls apart based on a certain imperial imperial narcissism well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser portly Max Keiser estate certainly thank our guests plunky if you unrighteous on Twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye yo
