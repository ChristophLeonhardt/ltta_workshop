esra levan here for the rebel dot media I am surrounded by probably 1,500 Tommy Robinson supporters outside the Old Bailey that's the traditional name for the Central Criminal Court's here in the heart of London I have never seen such a crowd like this before boisterous enthusiastic chanting is you can hear the Tommy Robinson chants and other chants a very well behaved and disciplined crowd organic I see some flags lots of British flags I see some for Britain political party flags I saw some UK flags and I don't think you could see them from behind the mass of police but there are about 16 anti Tommy professional protesters the anti fuzz style vastly outnumbered by journalists and of course by police this is a very different scene than there was for Tommy's earlier court appearances at the Royal Courts of Justice before the Court of Appeal there Tommy specifically asked his fans not attend and indeed very few did this is the opposite there's actually a celebratory feel here I would say I think it's mainly because this is the first time many people have seen Tommy with their own eyes since his release from prison about seven weeks ago there's a celebratory mood outside but I don't know what it'll be like inside because this is really a double jeopardy retrial of his original contempt hearing now I was looking earlier at the docket the lineup of other cases being heard in the Old Bailey and what you need to understand is this is not a junior court this is the most serious criminal court in London perhaps in the whole UK on trial today our murder our accused murderers accused terrorists of the most severe variety and amongst those alleged hardened criminals is Tommy Robinson on trial for a civil contempt charge for talking into his iPhone on a Facebook livestream it's so incongruous to have a trivial civil contempt matter tried at the Old Bailey that in itself shows the just as here the fact that there's a second hearing at all is quite odd to me for this would be called double jeopardy back in North America it's hard for me to think straight with all the Tommy Chan thing going on so let me sign off now but for those who are interested for the rest of the day I will be filing reports at Tommy Trial calm if you want to see my reports from inside the court or my video reports from outside the court check in with me today at Tommy Trial calm you
