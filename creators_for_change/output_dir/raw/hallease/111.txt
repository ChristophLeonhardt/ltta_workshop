channel and it also just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you</font>

14

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,309
little bit too much I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to calm it</font>

16

down just a little bit yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,430
kind of helped me to start thinking

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">about myself more as an artist which</font>

19
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,829
I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of struggled to do you know</font>

20
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,390
I've always<font color="#E5E5E5"> been hesitant to say like I</font>

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,820
make art but you look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,949
vlogs and I'm definitely starting to

23
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,409
develop a style<font color="#E5E5E5"> and especially in my</font>

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,960
just kind of whatever vlogs I think they

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,580
look a little more cinematic and that

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,320
sort of thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know let me know</font>

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,340
in the comments below<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you think</font>

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,430
about that but yeah trying to be myself

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,100
and like what is myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what is</font>

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,350

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,720
year was creating the fitbit video

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,790
mostly because i know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

34
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,799
straight up like an ad<font color="#CCCCCC"> to y'all and that</font>

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,840
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't fit in with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,500
culture of YouTube content when

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,299
something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so blatantly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scenes</font>

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,259
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ad but I really did want to</font>

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,090
approach that video<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point of</font>

40
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,570

43
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,680
content for them I just really wanted to

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,689
challenge myself in relation to what I

45
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,070
actually do full time because making

46
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that is what I do in my</font>

that video

53
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,070
in a day and it didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really even hit</font>

54
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:20,700
me how intense that is actually until

62
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,360
myself for just creating something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,660
