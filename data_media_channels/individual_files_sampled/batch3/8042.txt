NEWS. THERE IS SO MUCH OF IT, OPENING MONOLOGUE. STORE MACK TODAY AFTER WEEKS OF BEING SMEARED BY DEMOCRATS, CALLED EVIL, ACCUSED OF RATE AND GANG RAPE AND COMPARED TO BILL COSBY, AFTER WEEKS OF VILE DEATH THREATS AGAINST HIS FAMILY AND WEEKS OF BEING DEMONIZED ALL OVER TELEVISION AND MOST MAJOR NEWSPAPERS, TODAY BRETT KAVANAUGH FINALLY HAD A CHANCE UNDER OATH TO CLEAR HIS GOOD NAME. DRAMATIC TESTIMONY TODAY, POWERFUL TESTIMONY. WATCH THIS. Judge Kavanaugh: THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS BECOME A NATIONAL DISGRACE. THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE SENATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, BUT YOU HAVE REPLACED ADVICE AND CONSENT WITH SEARCH AND DESTROY. SINCE MY NOMINATION IN JULY, THERE HAS BEEN A FRENZY ON THE LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING, ANYTHING, TO BLOCK MY CONFIRMATION. SHORTLY AFTER I WAS NOMINATED, THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE LEADER SAID HE WOULD QUOTE OPPOSE ME WITH EVERYTHING HE'S GOT. A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ON THIS COMMITTEE PUBLICLY REFERRED TO ME AS EVIL, GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE THOSE. IS IT ANY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT AGAINST MY FAMILY? TO SEND ANY VIOLENT EMAIL TO MY WIFE? TO MAKE ANY KIND OF ALLEGATION AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY FRIENDS, TO BLOW ME UP AND TAKE ME DOWN? YOU SEWED THE WIND. FOR DECADES TO COME I FEAR THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL REAP THE WHIRLWIND. JUDGE KAVANAUGH ALSO HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE PROCESS, AND HIS FAMILY AND WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ENDURE AGAIN WITH ZERO CORROBORATION, NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND NO DUE PROCESS. WATCH THIS. THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT BUT AT LEAST IT WAS A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED ATTEMPT AT BARKING. THOSE EFFORTS DIDN'T WORK. I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH AT THOSE HEARINGS AND IT LOOKS LIKE I MIGHT GET CONFIRMED, A NEW TACTIC WAS NEEDED. SOME OF YOU ARE LYING AND RATE COMIC WEIGHT AND HAD IT READY. THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD IN SECRET FOR WEEKS BY A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF. IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU COULDN'T TAKE ME OUT ON THE MERITS. WHEN IT WAS NEEDED, THIS ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER DR. FORD'S WISHES. THIS WHOLE TWO WEEK EFFORT HAS BEEN A CALCULATED AND ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT. FUELED WITH A PARENT PENT UP ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 2016 ELECTION, FEAR THAT HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT MY JUDICIAL RECORD, REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE CLINTONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IN MONEY FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING OPPOSITION GROUPS. THIS IS A CIRCUS. THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND LONG PAST MY NOMINATION. THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US FOR DECADES. Sean: AFTER THOSE POWERFUL REMARKS, JUDGE KAVANAUGH ADDRESSED HIS ACCUSER, PROFESSOR CHRISTINE FORD. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS EMOTIONAL MOMENT FROM EARLIER TODAY. I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS TO HER OR ANYONE. THAT'S NOT WHO I AM, IT'S NOT WHO I WAS. I AM INNOCENT OF THIS CHARGE. I INTEND NO ILL WILL TO DR. FORD AND HER FAMILY. THE OTHER NIGHT ASHLEY AND MY DAUGHTER LIZA SAID THEIR PRAYERS AND, LITTLE LIES ALL OF TEN YEARS OLD... SAID TO ASHLEY, WE SHOULD PRAY FOR THE WOMAN. THAT'S A LOT OF WISDOM FROM A 10-YEAR-OLD. Sean: WE ARE THAT ON MY RADIO SHOW WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND ME. GUYS AND GIRLS, THEY ALL WERE CRYING. POWERFUL MOMENT AND SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BUT LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO REVIEW THE CHARGES FROM PROFESSOR FORD, WHERE ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE IN JULY TO A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF CONGRESS. SHE CLAIMS THAT THOSE CLAIMS COME BACK AFTER NEARLY FOUR DECADES AND I'VE BEEN SAYING, SHE DESERVED TO BE HEARD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE SERIOUS AND HAVE BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY THE PRESIDENT, THE SENATE AND BY EVERYBODY. SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER A DATE, DAY OF THE WEEK LOCATION, OR HOW SHE GOT TO OR FROM THE PARTY WHERE THE ALLEGED CRIME TOOK PLACE. ALL OF THE WITNESSES THAT PROFESSOR FORD CORROBORATED WITH HER CLAIMS, THEY ALL DENIED THAT SHE WAS ALLEGING. ALL FOUR WITH SWORN STATEMENTS UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY. ALL WITNESSES HAVE GIVEN SWORN STATEMENTS UNDER THE PENALTY OF FELON, COULD FELONY MEANING YOU COULD GO TO JAIL, TO THE DEMOCRATS. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED AND THE PEOPLE THERE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN. THAT INCLUDES PROFESSOR FORD'S FRIEND, HER NAME, LELAND KEISER. HER ATTORNEY RELEASED A STATEMENT READING "SIMPLY PUT, MR. CAVANAUGH KAVANAUH MR. CAVANAUGH KAVANAUA MR. CAVANAUGH KAVANAUD MR. CAVANAUGH KAVANAUH MR. CAVANAUGH KAVANAUS MR. CAVANAUGH KAVANAUN MS. KEISER DOES KNOW MR. CAVANAUGH KAVANAUO RECOLLECTION OF BEING AT A PARTY WHERE HE WAS PRESENT WITH OR WITHOUT DR. FORD." TODAY THE SENATE'S INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR ASKED HER ABOUT THIS IRREFUTABLE FACT. TAKE A LOOK. ARE YOU AWARE THAT THEY SAY THEY HAVE NO MEMORY OR KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A PARTY? YES. DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR MOTIVES TO ASCRIBE TO LELAND? I COULD TAKE THOSE ONE AT A TIME. LELAND HAS SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CHALLENGES AND I'M HAPPY THAT SHE'S FOCUSING ON HERSELF AND GETTING THESE HEALTH TREATMENTS THAT SHE NEEDS. SHE LET ME KNOW THAT SHE NEEDED HER LAWYER TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FOR HER, AND SHE TEXTED ME RIGHT AFTERWARD WITH AN APOLOGY, AND GOOD WISHES AND ET CETERA. SO I'M GLAD SHE'S TAKING CARE OF HERSELF. THAT IS TESTIMONY FROM PROFESSOR FORD WHICH ACTUALLY RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT ANSWERED, INCLUDING THIS MOMENT ABOUT FORD'S RECENT POLYGRAPH TEST. LET'S LOOK AT THIS. WHY WAS THAT LOCATION CHOSEN FOR THE POLYGRAPH? I HAD LEFT MY GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL AT FORT LINCOLN CEMETERY THAT DAY AND I WAS ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE TO GET A PLANE TO MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE, SO HE WAS WILLING TO COME TO ME WHICH IS APPRECIATED. SO HE ADMINISTERED A POLYGRAPH ON THE DAY THAT YOU ATTENDED YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL? CORRECT. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NEXT DAY, I SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HOTEL. NOT SURE OF THE EXACT DAY. DID YOU PAY FOR THE POLYGRAPH YOURSELF? I DON'T THINK SO. DO YOU KNOW WHO DID PAY FOR THE POLYGRAPH? NOT YET, NO. I BELIEVE YOU SAID IT HADN'T BEEN PAID FOR YET, IS THAT CORRECT? LET ME PUT AN END TO THIS MISERY. HER LAWYERS HAVE PAID FOR HER POLYGRAPH. AS IS ROUTINE. AS HIS ROUTINE. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO ASSIST YOU WITH SOME OF THESE FEES INCLUDING THE COST FOR YOUR POLYGRAPH? I'M AWARE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL GO FIND ME SITES THAT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE THOSE, BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD ONE. TO RECAP, PROFESSOR FORD DOESN'T REMEMBER WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AND SHE IS GIVEN INCONSISTENT ANSWERS ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT DETAIL. SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHO ATTENDED THE PARTY IN QUESTION. SHE HAS GIVEN INCONSISTENT ANSWERS ABOUT THIS DETAIL AND SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER HOW SHE GOT TO THE ALLEGED PARTY. SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER HOW SHE GOT BACK FROM THE PARTY AND NOT ONE PERSON CORROBORATES HER STORY. WE ALSO LEARNED TODAY SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER IF SHE HANDED "THE WASHINGTON POST" THERAPY NOTES JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. JUST MINUTES AGO, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" EDITORIAL BOARD FULLY ENDORSED THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH AND ALSO MOMENTS AGO WE LEARNED THAT SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL ANNOUNCED THE SENATE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD HE SAID. AND MOMENTS AGO, SENATOR BOB CORKER OF TENNESSEE ANNOUNCED ON TWITTER THAT HE WILL VOTE YES ON BRETT KAVANAUGH. TWO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN OR LIBERAL CONSERVATIVE AT ALL. THEY WANTED TO RUIN JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND UNSUBSTANTIATED AND UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS FROM NEARLY FOUR DECADES AGO. FROM THE LEFT AT THIS POINT, IT'S NOT ABOUT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT KEITH ELLISON. THEY WOULD HAVE HAD MORE ARE STATEMENTS ABOUT BILL CLINTON. THIS HAS NOT BEEN ABOUT PROTECTING VICTIMS OR FINDING THE TRUTH. FOR THEM, DAY ONE WITH CHUCK SCHUMER LEAVING THE WAY, IT'S A SAD DAY FOR THE COUNTRY AND WHAT WE HAD TO WITNESS TODAY. THE WORST PART OF THIS IS, SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN KNEW ABOUT THESE CLAIMS SINCE JULY. SHE KNEW ABOUT THESE CHARGES WHEN SHE ACTUALLY MET WITH KAVANAUGH IN PRIVATE. SHE KNEW ABOUT THESE CLAIMS WHEN SHE QUESTIONED HIM DURING HIS PUBLIC HEARING SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. WHEN SHE MET PRIVATELY WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH, SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN RECOMMENDING ATTORNEYS TO PROFESSOR FORD. ONLY AFTER BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION LOOKED IMMINENT DID DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND DEMOCRATS ANNOUNCE FORD'S ALLEGATIONS. THIS HAS BEEN A DISGRACEFUL DISPLAY OF POLITICS AT ITS WORS WORST. HIS REELECTION MORE IMPORTANT THEN ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE HERE? DID ANYONE HEAR THE PAIN IN BRETT KAVANAUGH'S VOICE TODAY? AND I WOULD ARGUE TOO, PROFESSOR FORD TO COME UP AS SUSAN COLLINS HAS SAID IT, NOBODY HAS BEEN SERVED WELL HERE. THE STORY GOT LEAKED, HER NAME GOT LEAKED AND WITHOUT ANY CORROBORATION OR EVIDENCE, THEN YOU HAVE POLITICIANS SMEARING CAVANAUGH AGAIN AND AGAIN ON NATIONAL TV. AND THIS IS JUST A SMALL SAMPLING. THE SENATE SHOULDN'T SIMPLY RELY ON HEARING TWO CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS, AND WE ARE OKAY WITH NOT KNOWING AND WE MIGHT BE PUTTING SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED ATTEMPTED RAPE ON THE SOUTHERN COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE HER. LISTEN, FIRST OF ALL, ANYONE WHO COMES FORWARD AT THIS POINT TO BE PREPARED TO TESTIFY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IS BEING NOMINATED TO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL POSITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, THAT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF COURAGE. NOT ONLY DO WOMEN LIKE DR. FORD WHO BRAVELY COME FORWARD NEED TO BE HEARD, BUT THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED. I WANT TO SAY THAT TO THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY, JUST SHUT UP AND STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING. LET ME SAY AT THE OUTSET, I BELIEVE DR. FORD, I BELIEVE THE SURVIVOR HERE, THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE HER. SHE'S COME FORWARD BRAVELY. I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD BE BULLIED INTO THIS SCENARIO, OR IS HE SAID, SHE SAID. IT'S A SHAME HEARING. I BELIEVE PROFESSOR FORD. I THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE AND I THINK WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS FINISHED, AND WHEN SHE TESTIFIE TESTIFIES, AND WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH TESTIFIES, I THINK THE MAJORITY OF SENATORS WILL FIND HER CREDIBLE. Sean: THE SMEARS CONTINUED DURING THE HEARING AND TODAY DEMOCRATS RAMPING UP THEIR FAVORITE NEW TALKING POINT. WE MUST HAVE AN FBI INVESTIGATION. NOW, THIS IS OF COURSE ALL A POLITICAL STALL TACTIC. THEY WANT DELAY, DELAY, DELAY. THE HOPE WE GET TO THE MIDTERMS, THEY HOPE THEY WIN AND THEY HOPE THEY STOP DONALD TRUMP FROM FULFILLING A CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION. WATCH THE ECHO CHAMBER AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS, I WILL EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS PHONY, AND THEY KNOW IT. TAKE A LOOK. Judge Kavanaugh: THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL DEMOCRATIC EMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE A FEW WEEKS AGO AT MY HEARING WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT, BUT AT LEAST IT WAS JUST AN OLD-FASHIONED ATTEMPTS AT BORKING. WHEN I DID OKAY AT THE HEARINGS ENOUGH TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I MIGHT GET CONFIRMED, NEW TACTICS WERE NEEDED. SOME OF YOU WERE LYING IN WAIT, AND HAD IT READY. THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD IN SECRET FOR WEEKS BY A DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF. IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU COULDN'T TAKE ME OUT ON THE MERITS. WHEN IT WAS NEEDED, THIS ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER DR. FORD'S WISHES. THIS WHOLE TWO-WEEK EFFORT HAS BEEN A CALCULATED AND ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT. FUELED WITH A PARENT PENT UP ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 2016 ELECTION, I FEAR THAT HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT MY JUDICIAL RECORD, REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE CLINTONS, AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MONEY FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING OPPOSITION GROUPS. THIS IS A CIRCUS. THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND LONG PAST MY NOMINATION. THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US FOR DECADES. Sean: AN FBI INVESTIGATION DOES NOT MAKE CONCLUSIONS, THEY ALL KNEW THIS. THEY INTERVIEWED EVERYBODY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN INTERVIEWED AND A REPORT WOULD THEN BE ISSUED. THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE ACTUALLY USELESS, AS WORDS, AND THEY ALL AGREED BACK THEN. TAKE A LOOK. THE NEXT PERSON THAT REFERS TO AN FBI REPORT AS BEING WORTH ANYTHING OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE REACH A CONCLUSION. PERIOD. SO JUDGE, THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS. THE REASON WHY WE CAN'T RELY ON THE FBI REPORT, HE WOULD LIKE IT IF WE DID BECAUSE IT IS INCONCLUSIVE. THEY SAY HE SAID, SHE SAID AND THEY SAID, PERIOD. SO WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE AN FBI REPORT BEFORE YOU, UNDERSTAND, THEY DO NOT. THEY DO NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS. THEY DO NOT MAKE, AS MY FRIEND POINTS OUT MORE ADEQUATELY, THEY DO NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. Sean: IT REMEMBER ALL WITNESSES IN THIS CASE GAVE SWORN STATEMENTS UNDER THE THREAT OF FELONY. DEMOCRATS HAVE TURNED THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS INTO A POLITICAL SHAM. THEY HAVE TURNED ADVICE AND CONSENT INTO DESTROY AND MALIGN. THEY CAN'T CARE WHOSE LIFE IS DESTROYED IN THIS PROCESS, OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T. DID THEY NOT SEE WHAT WENT ON TODAY, TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH? THE IMPACT ON HIM AND HIS FAMILY? THE WOMEN MAKING THESE ALLEGATIONS AS THEY WITHHELD THEM FOR ALL THESE WEEKS? THEY JUST WANT CAVANAUGH STOPPED AT ALL COSTS. NO ONE SEEMS TO PUT THIS IN BETTER PERSPECTIVE THAN SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. AND PLEASE TAKE A LOOK. I HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020, AND YOU SAID THAT, NOT ME. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. WHEN YOU SEE JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR OR AND KAGAN, I VOTED FOR THEM BUT I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS GUY. THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH. YOU ALL WANT POWER, I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT. I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE THROUGH THE SHAM, THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU HELD IT. YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF PROTECTING DR. FORD. NONE. SHE'S AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS YOU ARE. GOD, I HATE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN IT COMES TO THIS, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FAIR PROCESS? YOU CAME TO THE WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, MY FRIEND. TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF YOU VOTE NO, YOU ARE LEGITIMIZING THE MOST DESPICABLE THING I HAVE SEEN IN MY TIME IN POLITICS. Sean: SENATOR GRAHAM WILL JOIN US IN STUDIO IN JUST A MOMENT, AND AFTER THOSE PASSIONATE REMARKS, SENATOR ORRIN HATCH CALLED THESE PROCEEDINGS WORSE THAN ANY OTHER CONFIRMATION PROCEEDINGS IN HISTORY, INCLUDING THOSE OF JUDGE BORK AND JUDGE THOMAS. LET'S WATCH THIS. OF THE CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED SINCE MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES FIRST LEAKED DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS TO THE MEDIA TWO WEEKS AGO, AFTER SITTING ON THEM FOR SIX WEEKS, I MIGHT ADD IT, HAS BROUGHT US THE WORST IN OUR POLITICS. IT CERTAINLY HAS BROUGHT US NO CLOSER TO THE TRUTH, ANONYMOUS LETTERS WITH NO NAME AND NO RETURN ADDRESS ARE NOT BEING TREATED AS NATIONAL NEWS. LAWYERS WITH FACIALLY IMPLAUSIBLE CLAIMS ARE DRIVING THE NEW CYCLE. I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THIS IS WORSE THAN ROBERT BORK AND I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET WORSE THAN THAT. THIS IS WORSE THAN CLARENCE THOMAS AND I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET WORSE THAN THAT. THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE, THE WAY YOU ARE BEING TREATED. Sean: THIS IS SADLY THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK. I WARN PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE TWO OR FOUR YEARS ON A RADIO SHOW AND RIGHT HERE ON THE SHOW, REPUBLICANS, BE PREPARED TO BE DEMONIZED, RACIST, SEXIST, MISOGYNIST, ISLAMOPHOBIC, XENA PHOBIC, YOU WANT DIRTY AIR AND WATER AND YOU WANT TO KILL CHILDREN AND THEIR SON PAUL RYAN LOOK A LIKE THROWING YOUR GRANDMOTHER OVER THE CLIFF BECAUSE REPUBLICANS WANT GRANNY TO DIE. IT'S THE SAME NOW WITH SUPREME COURT NOMINEES, SAME PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR. WE HAVE NOW COME TO EXPECT THIS. THIS HAS TO CHANGE, THIS COUNTRY DESERVES BETTER. THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY DESERVE BETTER. THESE PEOPLE IN D.C., AND THIS SWAMP, THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO SERVE US, YOU, WE COME AT THE PEOPLE. IT'S NOT ABOUT A REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE HERE, THIS IS PURE HUMAN DECENCY THAT WAS IN PLAY TODAY. THEY DESTROYED THIS MAN AND HIS FAMILY. THEY BLUDGEONED HIM, ALL FOR THE SAKE OF POWER. THERE WAS ZERO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE HERE OR DUE PROCESS. NOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, EVERY 2-4 YEARS, EVERY TIME WE HAVE A NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT, WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. THE PARTY OF SLANDER, BESMIRCH MEANT, SMEARS, CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, THE PARTY OF NO DUE PROCESS, NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. THE PARTY THAT RUSHES TO JUDGMENT. LOOK AT ALL THE HIGH PROFILE CASES RUSHED TO JUDGMENT. THE DUKE LACROSSE CLICK CASE, CAMBRIDGE POLICE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, RICHARD JEWELL, TRAVE ON MARTIN. IS THIS THE PARTY THAT IS GOING TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THIS COUNTRY? BECAUSE IN 40 DAYS, THAT SAME PARTY WANTS YOU TO GO OUT AND VOTE FOR THEM. LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN. USING THESE REPUBLICAN SENATORS? THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DECIDE THE FATE OF THE KAVANAUGH NOMINATION. RIGHT THERE. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL DECIDE IF WE STILL HAVE DUE PROCESS IN THIS COUNTRY. IF THESE PRINCIPLES EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY, IF WE STILL HAVE LAWS PREDICATED ON THE CONSTITUTION, LET THEM KNOW HOW TO VOTE. CALL THEM. TELL THEM WHAT IS AT STAKE. LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU FELT TODAY WATCHING THESE HEARINGS, AND IF YOU ARE IN ONE OF THE STATES WHERE DONALD TRUMP ONE, WEST VIRGINIA, JOE MANCHIN, NORTH DAKOTA HEIDI HEITKAMP, INDIANA JOE DONNELLY, YOU'RE A SENATORS UP FOR REELECTION. THEY DON'T CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND THEY GO ALONG WITH THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN. IF THEY GO AHEAD AND DO THAT, ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR THEM? THERE IS A LOT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WEEKS AND MONTHS THAT WE ARE GOING TO DECIDE AND WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO IN THE COURSE OF THIS PROGRAM TONIGHT. I JUST WANT TO SAY, WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE TONIGHT, WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, YOU GET TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR YOUR DECISIONS. NEVER HAS A SUPREME COURT NOMINATION BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. THIS COUNTRY IS AT A TIPPING POINT. INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF AMERICANS WILL CONTINUE OR WE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK. OUR CONSTITUTION, ALL THESE CORE PRINCIPLES HANG IN THE BALANCE TONIGHT AND WE HAVE ONE PARTY THAT IS THROWING ALL OF THIS TO THE WIND AND ADOPTED SMEAR, SLANDER, PERSONAL POLITICS AND DESTRUCTION, AND UNLESS GOOD SENATORS FIND A BACK BORN AND STICK UP FOR THESE CORE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS. DUE PROCESS, JUSTICE, LAW,
