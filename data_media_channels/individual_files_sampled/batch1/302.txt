supporters of the extreme right-wing gather outside a DC metro station jeered at by a number of onlookers but the rally's principal organizer insists he's simply asserting the right to freedom of speech anybody who stands up right if they say anything controversial they get escorted by police the right-wingers begin their march to the designated rally area near the White House where counter protesters were gathering it's kind of ridiculous that in 2018 I have to make this sign that our friends have to kind of come here I saw a really great sign over there that said I'd rather be at brunch but I have to come protest Nazis instead among them family groups intent on making their voices heard we wanted to be part of all the positive energy resisting some of the mean nasty spirit spirited examples of the neo-nazis and it's so magnificent look how many people are out here people come now the woodwork we want to show the people who are here then the Nazis the white supremacists that are here now what they're doing and and what these beliefs they have are unacceptable they're unamerican it's not patriotic in us the real Americans we love this country and we will not tolerate that kind of behavior but here too some who say they are prepared to use violence rather than ideas to oppose the far-right members of the self-styled anti-fascist movement intent on remaining anonymous by DC standards this is a small demonstration stroll throughout the day it became clear that the counter protesters composed of disparate groups far outnumber those that label themselves the alt-right viewed by those here as white supremacists the groups were kept apart by a maze of police barricades but even so the shouts of the counter protesters drowned out attempted speeches by the right and as rain begin to fall all were dispersed the vastly outnumbered right-wingers assured into white police vans to be driven safely back to the Metro for their journeys home and what was billed as a gathering of white nationalists became instead as celebration of the city's diversity and a protest against the President in office at the White House over the road Mike Hanna al Jazeera Washington
