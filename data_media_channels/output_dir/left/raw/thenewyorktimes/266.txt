1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,049
the president I state says attacked me
he's attacked our NATO allies at times

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:09,840
he's attacked the whole cast of Hamilton
and Mailer Streep

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,460
the only person he seems unwilling to
want to criticise in any way is Vladimir

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:24,689
Putin we need a president who has the
guts to stand up to Vladimir Putin and

5
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,220
we are just not seeing that out of this
president advisers told him before I

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,200
picked up the phone explicitly in all
caps do not congratulate Vladimir Putin

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,050
what did the president do I had a call
with President Putin and congratulated

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,940
him on the victory his electoral victory
Russia intervened in our presidential

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,989
election it was a historically close
election and the Russians intervened

10
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,760
through social media by pretending to be
Americans and among them they decided

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,129
that race was a really good issue to be
used to divide Americans President Putin

12
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,210
has clearly come to the conclusion
there's little price to play here this

13
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,510
is serious business
all of the intelligence chiefs agreed

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,070
Russia intervened there should be no
doubt that Russia perceived that it's

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,570
past efforts as as successful so what's
stopping us the president is stomping us

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,049
because the person United States cannot
even accept the fact that the Russians

17
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,400
intervened on his behalf I said it very
simply I think it could very well have

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,090
been Russia but I think it could well
have been other countries probably there

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,170
was meddling from other countries and
maybe other individuals he views it as a

20
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,950
threat to the legitimacy of his
presidency and it's leaving our country

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,689
exposed the United States announced
sanctions on Thursday against 19 Russian

22
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,460
individuals these sanctions are a good
step in the right direction but they

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,820
also don't go nearly far enough
the Kremlin said these sanctions were

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,380
expected they aren't that big of a deal
federal government is largely sitting on

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,020
its hands because this president views
any mention of Russia as a threat these

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,909
things are undeniable and we need to
confront them because they haven't

27
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,530
stopped we need to protect ourselves and
we need to deter the Russians from any

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,590
further involvement in our affair
this isn't a Democrat versus Republican

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:00:00,000
issue sadly this is a Donald Trump
versus all the rest of this issue
