THIS IS PAUL RYAN'S ANGRY REACTION. THEY HUGGED IT OUT. THEY CAN'T OPPOSE PRES. TRUMP BECAUSE HE IS IN HIS OWN PARTY. LET'S GO TO RYAN'S REACTION. AFTER YESTERDAY'S MEETING, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE A TRUSTWORTHY NEGOTIATING PARTNER AND THE PRESIDENT THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF THE REPUBLICANS? I DO. LOOK, I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF INTERPRETATIONS ABOUT THE MEETING YESTERDAY. ISN'T IT A GOOD THING THAT CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TALK? IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING. THE PRESIDENT MADE IT REALLY CLEAR AND WHAT HE WAS AIMING FOR YESTERDAY AND THAT MEETING WAS A BIPARTISAN MOMENT WHILE THE COUNTRY IS FACING TWO HORRIBLE HURRICANES. I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE HURRICANES. I THINK THEY JUST LIFTED THE DEBT CEILING. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH? WHAT A MINUTE DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU HATED THIS POTENTIAL DEAL THE DAY BEFORE? THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT. YOU DESCRIBED THE PLAN TO BUNDLE HARVEY RELIEF WITH THE DEBT CEILING AS RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL ñ I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH. I THINK I DESCRIBED A SHORT-TERM DEBT LIMIT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CREDIT MARKETS AND DOING THIS ON SHORT-TERM BASIS ñ WE CAN KEEP DOING IT THAT WAY. I WAS MAKING AN ECONOMIC POINT WHICH IS WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT MARKETS, I THINK STABILITY AND LONGEVITY ARE KEY. SO YOU DID NOT CALL IT RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL? REALLY? LET'S GO TO PAUL RYAN FROM YESTERDAY. I THINK THAT'S A RIDICULOUS IDEA. I HOPE THEY DON'T MEAN THAT. LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS. WE'VE GOT ALL THIS DEVASTATION IN TEXAS. WE'VE GOT ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED HURRICANE ABOUT TO HIT FLORIDA, AND THEY WANT TO PLAY POLITICS WITH THE DEBT CEILING? THEY ALSO WANT TO THREATEN DEFAULTING OUR DEBT, I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL. AT THIS MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE FELLOW CITIZENS IN NEED TO RESPOND TO THESE HURRICANES SO THAT WE DO NOT STRAIN THEM. I LOVE CATCHING POLITICIANS IN LIES. THE DAY BEFORE HE IS LIKE TO COMBINE HURRICANE HARVEY WITH LIFTING THE SHORT-TERM DEBT CEILING? THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. TODAY THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID. ONE MORE TIME. YOU DESCRIBED THE PLAN TO BUNDLE HARVEY RELIEF WITH RAISING THE DEBT CEILING AS RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL. I DID NOT DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY. I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH. GO BACK TO YESTERDAY. DID HE ACTUALLY UTTER THESE WORDS? I THINK THAT IS A RIDICULOUS IDEA, I HOPE THEY DON'T MEAN THAT. LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS, WE HAVE ALL THIS DEVASTATION IN TEXAS, ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED HURRICANE ABOUT TO HIT FLORIDA, AND THEY WANT TO PLAY POLITICS WITH THE DEBT CEILING? AND THEY ALSO WANT TO THREATEN DEFAULTING OUR DEBT? I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL THAT THEY WANT TO PLAY POLITICS WITH THE DEBT CEILING AT THIS MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE FELLOW CITIZENS IN NEED TO RESPOND TO THESE HURRICANES SO THAT WE DO NOT STRAIN THEM. OOPS. THE MARCO RUBIO MOMENT FOR PAUL RYAN.
