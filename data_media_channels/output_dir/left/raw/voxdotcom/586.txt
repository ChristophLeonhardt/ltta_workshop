00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,730
Here’s america.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,540
And here are 100 dots representing 100% of
the population.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,860
At any time, about 30% of the population has
been considered eligible to serve in the military

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,750
based on a shifting definition.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,120
But that number has been surprisingly stable.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,460
Here the portion of Americans that served
in the Revolution.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,920
Here’s how many Americans served in the
Civil War.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,310
and World War I.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,320
World War II was our peak, at 17% – over
half of the likely eligible population.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,400
During Vietnam, fewer served.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,820
Today, the portion of Americans who served
in the Global War on Terror, America’s longest

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,030
war, mostly in Afghanistan and Iraq, is down
to less than one percent.

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,340
So where are we now?

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,040
Civilians, and military are simply getting
further apart.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,250
While 76% of Americans over 65 say an immediate
family member served, the same is only true

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,770
for 33% of 18-29 year olds.

17
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,570
And military service is becoming concentrated
in fewer families.

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,820
79% of service members have an immediate family
member who served.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,369
Fewer of our leaders served than ever before.

20
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,880
And none of the year’s presidential candidates
served.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,189
But having less veterans isn’t, necessarily,
a bad thing.

22
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,069
It’s a direct consequence of ending the
draft, which was a great idea for all sorts

23
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:28,499
of reasons, from moral objections to involuntary
service, to arguments economists made, like

24
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:30,770
average skill of soldiers and cost of training.

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,490
And the death toll of war has also dropped
around the world, so fewer soldiers are needed.

26
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,270
But, of course, there are consequences.

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,710
Veteran populations feel misunderstood and
unappreciated.

28
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,600
Stereotypes of veterans as heroes or ticking
time bomb dominant the media.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,969
And while "Thank you for your service" and
“we support our troops" are everywhere.

30
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:56,169
For many veterans this feels like a deflection
rather than a real recognition.

31
00:01:56,169 --> 00:02:00,770
Lets face it, most people don't think a whole
lot about the men and women who fight our

32
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,770
wars.

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,329
During the 27 years of the draft, the military
was deployed 19 times.

34
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,229
In the years since, it’s been deployed 144
times.

35
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,310
And the burdens of these wars are shouldered
on that ever narrower group of Americans.

36
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,330
While the consequences of our modern war machine
feel ever further from the rest of us.

into the story of the military-civilian divide.
