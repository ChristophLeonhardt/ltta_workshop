this is Ezra Levin for the rebel media I have just received word from Tommy Robinson's family of some shocking news shocking but not surprising let me read to you the message I received moments ago they have pulled his appeal on July 10th the state says they are not ready unquote can you imagine that Tommy Robinson has an appeal on July 10th the judge is being selected Lord Justice Bryan Levison literally the most senior judge in all the criminal courts United Kingdom the courtroom was selected courtroom five the time was set 10 a.m. Tommy's lawyers who have been hired two weeks ago are ready they've been working furiously July 10th was going to be the hearing and now today the state says we're not ready so Tommy can rot in solitary confinement a little bit longer until they're ready not ready Tommy was sentenced on May 25th that'll be a month and a half from his sentencing to July 10th they're not ready the Crown Prosecution Service of the United Kingdom is the largest law firm in the United Kingdom they have more lawyers than any other firm they're not expert in the law of contempts they need more time that is a damnable lie what's so frustrating about that is that everyone else is ready Justice Leveson is ready Tommy's lawyers to read even though they've only been on the file for two weeks but the state is not ready so Tommy can wait a little bit longer you know what's so outrageous here is this exquisite demand for due process where was it on May 25th when Tommy was hauled off the streets had at what a 12-minute hearing and was dispatched to prison within hours where was the delay for Tommy Robinson to prepare properly where was the delay for him to meet with his own lawyers to prepare a defense Tommy had to be whisked into prison within minutes but the state can take its luxurious time while Tommy rots this is outrageous this is what Tommy would call a stitch-up I was a little bit concerned about Justice Leveson because he's a little bit political but I thought he's a senior judge he's a sober minded man I think we're in good hands I thought to myself little did I know that the UK version of the deep state or whomever it is said make him wait a little bit longer and there's no possible explanation if you've read Tommy's book enemy of this state you will learn how the establishment rigs the rules and violates the concept of the rule of law to use Tommy's phrase to stitch him up every time and I always rolled my eyes a bit I thought Tommy really yeah really and the entire world has learned today that Tommy Robinson is indeed a political prisoner and when Tommy was ready and the judge was ready and the court was ready that goddamn Crown Prosecution Service said no we'll let you rot a little bit longer I am outraged by this and so should you be whether or not you like Tommy Robinson you must acknowledge that the rule of law no longer is the rule of law in the United Kingdom I am furious there are only two things I know to do about this one is to write Tommy Robinson a letter in prison you can do that from email a prisoner calm and to help fund Tommy's lawyers and you can do that by going to save Tommy calm we're authorized by the family to crowdfund for it I'm outraged I don't know what else to say other than this is a this is an atrocious moment for the country that gave the world the Magna Carta for the rebel dawn media I'm Ezra lavance this is outrageous and I'm not even a Brit and I'm outraged if I was littering in the United Kingdom I would be beside myself right now for the state of my country if you want to follow the story go to save Tommy calm
