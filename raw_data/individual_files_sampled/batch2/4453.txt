the view from the staff the west wing as I know many of them talked to you and talked to you often what's the split on fear and loathing and how do they now recruit folks to fill some of these jobs it's a great question I think fear and loathing are heading down the track toward a photo finish they're both you know predominant emotions right now inside the White House is a real sense of dispirited staff there who are upset about various aspects congressman jolly to sort of ran through a whole series of of them you can understand why it must be difficult to work in the White House when you feel besieged by these things especially because you know a lot people who came to work in that White House came to do things that they thought were important for the country they wanted to cut taxes or reduce regulation and so forth they're not able to focus on these priorities because they're constantly dealing with incoming so it's a difficult time for the White House right now you see people heading for the doors you see people looking to figure out how they can get out the doors you don't see a whole lot of people coming in the doors who are we were you know top flight people there a lot of the people around Washington Republicans loyalists people who've been in the party their whole lives are not eager to come in and work there because they see what's happened to the people who are there right now and Peter david jolly just reminded us this is after all at the end of the day about governing and things like national security this president is so kind of comfort level oriented compared to all those who've gone before him you take two people out of this equation Keith Schiller the head of his security detail from New York one of his closest friends hope Hicks ditto someone he would talk to many many times a day they're gone they're gone from the equation so there are informed concerns about the boss I think it's exactly right you're you're very very smart to mention Keith Schiller I think people underestimate how important his departure is for the president he's somebody president really leaned on felt he could trust and rely on hope Hicks is in that same category you know they saw as a study by the Brookings Institution found that 34 percent turnover in the first year alone it's already now just two months into the second year that number would go up and they're people who as you say are some of the people who've been around the president the longest the ones that he can you know he's known and trusted and put a lot of investment in people coming in yes no as well and he's not as likely to build a comfort level of them for quite a while so it's a it's a difficult thing not just for the staff but for the president who's not feeling I think increasingly isolated inside his own home and building so Julia take what we've seen happen this week what how does it inform your thinking as you look to next week what do you believe could be next and yes I do try to get you to answer this question every week you do so you know another thing that we reported this week I referred along with my colleague Kendall a nyan is the fact that Muller now has enough or is preparing to in gathering information that could lead to an indictment on the Russian hacking that's that's really the heart of this investigation of how Russia was able to gain access to John Podesta Z mails and the Democratic National Committee's emails and the key here is Brian and if we're looking ahead is wondering are there going to be Americans whether they're named or not whether their unwitting or witting who were named in that indictment I think that that will really kind of get at the heart of all of this everything going on with Jared Kushner and his role in the Moller investigation is also really interesting though especially as we think about the original mandate that Muller had which was to look in to possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and then anything else that may arise so what that tells us is that these business dealings with Kushner there is something that arose during that investigation and so it also begs the question what else has arisen what other names do we not know that Muller has already cooperating there's so much beneath the surface here that it's hard to predict but if I'm looking at the one next thing it would be something on the hacking that the Russians played in - hey congressman an intentionally loaded question how did the GOP agenda advanced today listen what did not happen was oversight and that's where the GOP has been most careless look you dance with the devil you're gonna get burned I would say to Julius comment something we should look for coming what we are seeing and the investigation of Kushner is a model of what Muller is looking at for Donald Trump and I think Donald Trump is unraveling because he has a front row seat to seeing the vulnerability of Jared Kushner and he knows it soon could be him hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
