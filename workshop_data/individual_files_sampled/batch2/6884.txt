now Donald Trump as usual with some angry tweets and mean tweets and a lot of people couldn't figure out what the hell he's talking about but I did and I hope you're prepared to be shocked I think that he might be right about some of it whoa okay so let's explain so here's his tweets he says uranium deal to Russia with Clinton help and Obama administration knowledge is the biggest story that fake media doesn't want to follow he then says quote Russia sent millions the Clinton Foundation and the third one is workers a firm involved a discredited and fake dosti I take the fifth who who paid for it Russia the FBI or Dems are all so this is as usual sent at 4:00 in the morning does the guy ever sleep I don't know man I'm worried about this guy of course worried about him in a thousand different ways anyway some people have no idea what he said what do you Iranian Russia the FBI and the Democrats and the Russians working together in a collusion what in the world are you talking about so the reality is the hill actually had an excellent report and at least the first two tweets of his are actually fairly accurate so let me break it down for you they explained in the hill before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control a large swath of American uranium the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery kickbacks extortion and money laundering designed to grow vladimir putin's at atomic energy business inside the united states according to government documents and interviews now before i give you more of this i want to run one more video for you of trump again it is it's not great at the english language so as he's lashing out and attacking the Obama administration in such a convoluted way he didn't make clear what the point of that was which is this story which is a really interesting story so let me show you what Trump is saying and then they explain what parts are actually true your watch uranium is a big subject if the mainstream media would cover the uranium scandal and that Russia has 20% of a uranium for whatever reason and a lot of people understand what those reasons may be I think that's your Russia story that's your real Russia story not a story where they talk about collusion and there was none it was a hoax your real Russia story is uranium and how they got all of that you're in a vast percentage of what we have that is to me one of the big stories of the decade not just now of the decade the problem is that the mainstream media does not want to cover that story because that affects people that they protect so they don't like covering that story but the big story is uranium and how Russia got 20% of our uranium and it frankly it's a disgrace it's a disgrace and it's a disgrace that the fake news won't cover it it's so sad ok so it is true about the 20% as I'm gonna show you from the story in the hill oh right it's a story in the hill which is a mainstream news publication so they did cover it in fact they're the ones who exposed it and the New York Times had talked about it during the campaign so what do you mean they don't cover it the only reason you know about it is because they just covered it so let me explain what that is and I'll cover it for you so they have more details on on how the Russians got this and how portions of it were illegal they also obtained an eyewitness account back by documents indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the US designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton's Charitable Foundation during the time of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow sources told the hill these are sources inside the FBI so of course Trump has some of the story wrong if the FBI collaborated with the Russians and and the Democrats why are they telling you now about the Russians and the Democrats so that part also makes no sense but but again focus on the the substance of the story because it is an important one and and and it is deeply concerning the racketeering scheme was conducted with a consent of higher-level officials in Russia who shared the proceeds from the kickbacks one agent declared in affidavit years later so by the way a couple of things here one is how this uranium got sold off and who got paid in kickbacks etc the other is why it was not prominently talked about and while things were being approved so we'll get to that as well so more from the hill the first decision occurred they turn about two different decisions here the Obama administration aid first decision occurred in next October 2010 when the State Department and the government agencies on the Committee on foreign investment in the United States unanimously approved a partial sale of Canadian mining company uranium 1 to the Russian nuclear giant Rosso tone giving Moscow control over more than 20% of America's uranium supply so that's the 20% Trump's talking about and that is true they did do that that's an absolute fact ok now it could have been that they did that and it was perfectly legitimate and there was no bribes or kickbacks or anything along those lines or nothing untoward but as the hill is reporting that doesn't seem to be the case it seems like they might have gotten that through a lot of different methods and some of which were not legal so here's the second action that Obama administration took in 2011 the administration gave approval for Roseau tomes tenex subsidy subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to US nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States and Richmond Corporation so look if some of this is benign them selling them uranium to us I don't think is a huge deal and you know I'm open to being proven otherwise on that but I don't think that's a big deal but as the hill explains some of the deals including the trucking of the uranium could have been a national security issue okay now and the fact that they have 20% of our uranium so that they could make you could be they could utilize that for a number of weapons it's not like they don't have uranium from anywhere but again it is clearly a potential national security issue okay and an anonymous source tells the hill the Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats all of which raise legitimate national security concerns and none of that evidence got aired before they administer Obama administration made those decisions some details on the kickbacks the first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated November 27th of 29 2009 the records show that's important because we know that they're doing kickbacks in 2009 but we approve those decisions in 2010 and 2011 afterwards okay in evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015 an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in cases testified that mcaren which is the main guy main Russian involved here in this scheme who was later arrested supervised a quote racketeering scheme that involved extortion bribery money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia so there's serious wrongdoing going on here as well and the hill also reminds you that's when conservative author Peter Schweitzer in the New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his Charitable Foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at a bare minimum that is the appearance of corruption we don't take millions of dollars to your foundation while Hillary Clinton is a huge part of the decision and whether we sell off 20% of our uranium to the Russians that's a terrible idea but the only thing that's worse than that is taking hundreds of thousand dollars and putting it in your own pocket not to a charitable foundation but in your own pocket Bill Clinton while Hillary Clinton is helping to make that decision even if it's not corruption and boy it certainly looks like it even if it's not it's only as the appearance of corruption it makes people go I wonder if they did something wrong especially knowing that he'll in Hillary Clinton knew from the day that Obama got elected that she was gonna run again if you think you're gonna run for president again why would you do that because they can't help themselves the money the money the money okay so Trump unfortunately is right that that is a deeply concerning issue now that doesn't mean that his third tweet was right about how the FBI and the Democrats and Russia are somehow in cahoots over the dossier now what that was a dossier that's the the dossier that the Russia's apparently or allegedly prepared with compromising information about Donald Trump and some of that the partes of that dossier have already been proven correct others we don't know about and so he tastes the uranium one story which is true and then says and hence the dossier must not be true no that's not a hence at all and and there's a couple of future GPS officials who were instrumental in in ordering the production of that dossier who decided not to testify now that's curious in front of the house in a private meeting in a house that's interesting and I think that's noteworthy and we should look into that more but that doesn't mean it has anything to do with the uranium one deal it doesn't mean it has anything to do with the Democrats and remember it's people in the FBI they're exposing all this either way now I'm gonna it's just something to you that is both obvious to anyone else but apparently not obviously Donald Trump or the Democrats or even most of cable news maybe the Russians wanted to work with the Clintons in case they won but also wanted to have compromising materials and work with Trump in case he won ah to which the rest of us go of course of course they did and by the way have you noticed that Donald Trump has not authorised the sanctions on Russia now wait a minute the house and the Senate voted overwhelmingly ninety eight to two I think was a vote in the Senate saying that there the Russian sanction should not be lifted why because Trump wanted to lift them since they were gonna override his veto Trump had to sign that in the legislation but has he actually continued to put those sanctions on Russia turns out the answer is no so we're gonna Mother Jones the White House is blown by an October 1st deadline for beginning to implement new sanctions targeting Russia drawing concern and Congress the president Donald Trump is planning to ignore parts of a bill he grudgingly signed in August supposed to start October 1st Mother Jones wrote about that I think on October 11th here we are ten more days later roughly and still hasn't imposed the sanctions wait a minute you sign the bill you're supposed to do it the Treasury State Department's also have not issued guidance on their plans for imposing the measure as Senate aides said they're not even planning to put the new sanctions in place and Mother Jones reminds us that Trump opposed the new legislation agreeing to sign it only after it became clear that Congress could override his veto but he also issued a presidential signing statement suggesting he might ignore what he said were a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions in the legislation in other words I'm not gonna do it I'm gonna pretend to do it but here we are it was supposed to be on October 1st and many weeks later he still hasn't put the sanctions on Russia he never wanted to put the sanctions on Russia because he's working with Russia I think it is entirely possible that the Russians tried to influence both the Clintons and Trump in different ways and I think that they had some success with the Clintons unfortunately under the Obama administration or at least there's at least at a minimum the appearance of success on that and with Trump it seems like they have had spectacular success and no matter how much Congress demanded those sanctions and Trump signed it still nothing helped us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm / join
