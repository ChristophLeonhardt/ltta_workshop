THEM.
AINSLEY: IN A NEW OP-ED
REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE
IS SPEAKING OUT CALLING
THEIR BEHAVIOR A DIRECT
THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
BRIAN: STEVE SCALISE JOINS
US NOW.
CONGRESSMAN, IT'S AS IF THEY
FORGOT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
YOU WERE BLEEDING TO DEATH
AT SECOND BASE BECAUSE OF
BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER
THOUGHT HE HAD TO KILL
REPUBLICANS.
DO THEY UNDERSTANDING THAT
THESE DERANGED PEOPLE JUST
NEED A GO SIGN AND THEIR
AGGRESSION COULD BE THE
TRIGGER?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE
SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THIS
FROM THE LEFT.
AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR
IT.
WHAT I WROTE ABOUT IS THAT
WHEN YOU SEE THESE KINDS OF
THINGS BEING SAID, T. IS
INCITING PEOPLE AND FRANKLY
NOT THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD
BE GOING AND NOT WHAT OUR
COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT.
WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY THAT
CELEBRATES THE FACT WE CAN
ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH EACH
OTHER.
WE CAN DISAGREE WITH OUR
GOVERNMENT.
BUT THERE IS A WAY TO
RESOLVE IT YOU RESOLVE YOUR
DIFFERENCES AT THE BALLOT
BOX.
YOU DON'T RESORT TO
VIOLENCE.
AND TO SEE LEADERS CALLING
ON VIOLENCE, THAT HAPPENS IN
THIRD WORLD NATIONS.
NOT IN AMERICA.
AINSLEY: CONGRESSMAN, WHY
DID YOU DECIDE TO WRITE THE
OP-ED?
>> WELL, I'M CONCERNED THAT
YOU ARE SEEING AN INCREASE
OF THIS.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES
CALLING IT OUT.
YOU ARE SEEING LEADERS ON
THE RIGHT CALLING IT OUT.
YOU ARE NOT SEEING ANY
LEADERS ON THE LEFT CALLING
IT OUT.
IN FACT, YOU ARE SEEING SOME
OF THE LEADERS ON THE LEFT
INCITING MORE VIOLENCE.
CALLING ON MORE VIOLENCE
INSTEAD OF SAYING THERE IS
NO PLACE FOR IT.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA ASKING BOTH
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT
LEADERS TO STAND UP AGAINST
THIS KIND OF RHETORIC.
THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE.
STEVE: CONGRESSMAN SCALISE,
MAXINE WATERS JUST WORKS
ACROSS THE HALL FROM YOU IN
A FIGURE OF SPEECH.
YOU ARE WORKING IN THE SAME
BUILDING.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT GOING
OVER TO HER OFFICE AND
SAYING WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE TALKED
TO SOME DEMOCRATS ABOUT
THIS, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS THAT ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT IT.
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SOME OF
THEM SPEAKING OUT PUBLICLY
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT
IT IS GOING TO TAKE.
STEVE: WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK
TO HER DIRECTLY, SIR?
>> WELL, I HAVE SPOKEN TO A
NUMBER OF THEM DIRECTLY.
AND I THINK THE ONES I HAVE
SPOKEN TO, YOU KNOW, SOME OF
THEM GET IT SOME OF THEM
DON'T.
BUT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE GOT
TO KEEP SHINING A LIGHT ON
THIS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
THIS ISN'T WHAT POLITICS IS
ABOUT IN AMERICA.
IT'S NOT WHAT THE FOUNDING
OF OUR COUNTRY WAS ABOUT.
IT WAS ABOUT FREE SPEECH,
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.
NOT VIOLENCE AGAINST
ANYBODY.
AND, YOU KNOW, MARGARET
THATCHER USED TO SAY FIRST
YOU WIN THE ARGUMENT.
THEN YOU WIN THE VOTE.
THEY ARE NOT WINNING THE
ARGUMENT IF THEY ARE
RESORTING TO VIOLENCE.
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL LOSE
THE VOTE IF THEY CONTINUE TO
CALL ON VIOLENCE.
LOOK, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET
THIS ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK.
PEOPLE LIKE THE DIRECTION OF
THE COUNTRY.
THEY DON'T LIKE THE
DIRECTION THAT WE ARE
HEADED.
THEY GO OUT AND TRY TO LAY
OUT A BETTER COURSE AND
BETTER AGENDA.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY ARE
TRYING TO DO ON THE LEFT.
THEY ARE TRYING TO THREATEN
AND INTIMIDATE PEOPLE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICA IS
ABOUT.
>> CONGRESSMAN, I GET THE
SENSE WHEN I WATCH NOPTION
THAT SHE FEELS LIKE SHE IS
SPEAKER ALREADY.
DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S DONE
THAT YOU SHOULD GET MINORITY
OR DO YOU FEEL THERE IS MORE
TIME ON THE CLOCK LEFT WITH
THREE AND A HALF WEEKS?
>> INTEREST IS A
WE INTEREST IS A
WEEKNTEREST IS A
WEEKS?EREST IS A
>> THERE IS A LOT MORE GAME
LEFT TO BE PLAYED.
YOU FEEL A LOT OF MOMENTUM
OUR WAY.
PEOPLE WERE ANGERED BY WHAT
THEY SAW IN THE SENATE THE
LAST FEW WEEKS.
AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU TALK TO
THEM ABOUT THE ECONOMY, THEY
LIKE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING.
PEOPLE ARE WORKING.
THEY ARE GETTING HIGHER
WAGES NOW BECAUSE OF THE
WORK WE DID WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP TO CUT TAXES.
YOU ARE SEEING AN ECONOMY
THAT'S BOOMING.
AND, YET, DEMOCRATS WANT TO
RAISE TAXES.
THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH ICE.
THEY HAVE GOT A VERY LEFTIST
AGENDA THAT'S OUT OF TOUCH
WITH THE PEOPLE I'M TALKING
TO WHEN I GO TO SWING
DISTRICTS.
BRIAN: YOU DON'T THINK IT'S
OVER.
