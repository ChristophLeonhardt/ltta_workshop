116
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,970
NOT THE SENATE SEAT TO REPLACE 

117
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,139
JOHN McCAIN.

118
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,308

WHO WAS RETIRING FROM THE SENATE

124
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,286

138
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,160
OF COURSE, JOHN McCAIN COMES 

139
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,397
FROM AN HISTORIC MILITARY 

140
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:04,630

BEING OPENED.

145
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,115
WHEN THE VIETNAMESE FOUND THAT 

146
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,517
OUT, THEY OFFERED JOHN THE 

147
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,551
CHANCE TO COME HOME.

148
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,386
THEY SAID NO.

149
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,954
HE WOULD NOT COME BEFORE THOSE 

150
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,689
