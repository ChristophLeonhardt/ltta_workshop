We condemn in the strongest
possible terms this egregious
display of hatred bigotry
and violence on many sides,
on many sides.
I'm not putting anybody
on a moral plane.
What I'm saying is this.
You had a group on one side, and
you had a group at the other,
and they came at each other
with clubs, and it was vicious,
and it was horrible.
My fellow Americans, this is
the 34th time I'll speak to you
from the Oval
Office and the last.
I've spoken of the shining
city all my political life.
But I don't know if I ever quite
communicated what I saw when I
said it.
But in my mind it was
a tall, proud city,
built on rocks stronger than
oceans, windswept, god-blessed,
and teeming with people of
all kinds living in harmony
and peace, a city with three
ports that hummed with commerce
and creativity.
And if there had to be city
walls, the walls had doors.
And the doors were open
to anyone with the will
and the heart to get here.
And when someone has
recently endorsed Nazism,
it is inconceivable that such a
person can legitimately aspire
to leadership.
So I believe that David Duke
is an insincere charlatan.
I believe he's attempting
to hoodwink the voters
of Louisiana.
And I believe that he should
be rejected for what he is
and what he stands for.
I also want to speak tonight
directly to Muslims throughout
the world.
We respect your faith.
It's practiced freely by
many millions of Americans
and by millions more in
countries that America counts
as friends.
Its teachings are
good and peaceful.
And those who commit evil in
the name of Allah blaspheme
the name of Allah.
Justice grows out
of recognition,
of ourselves in each other, then
my liberty depends on you being
free too, that--
that history can't be a sword
to justify injustice or a shield
against progress.
But It must be a manual for how
to avoid repeating the mistakes
of the past, how
to break the cycle,
a roadway toward a better world.
Amazing grace, how sweet the
sound that saved a wretch like
me.
