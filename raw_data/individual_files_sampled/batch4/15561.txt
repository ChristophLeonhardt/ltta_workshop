NHS waiting times are the worst on record with more than 15% of patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency the latest stats show that despite a constant increase in funding the NHS is missing its targets for the fourth year in a row with fifteen point four percent of people in the accident an emergency department waiting more than four hours for treatment just imagine that more than four hours with a broken leg or some other painful injury sat on a plastic chair in A&E watching doctors running around rushed off their feet trying to keep up with the constantly increasing workload it's crazy but let me be clear from the start this isn't an attack on the doctors and nurses or medical staff in the NHS are incredible I don't know how they do the job they do I couldn't handle it but to be honest they can't really handle their workload right now either you know I'm still quite young and 25 but even I remember a time Wes than 20 years ago when doctors made home visits and the time that was spent in accident and emergency was way less I mean I was in and out of hospital with loads of stupid injuries as a kid as you do but the experience back then is nothing compared to what it is now the latest figures released by NHS England show that as of March 2018 eighty four point six percent of people are seen within four hours there is a gradual pattern of decline since March 2011 when the 95 percent target was exceeded since then the figures have been vary but the downward decline doesn't reflect funding in fact the funding for the NHS has increased year-on-year it's the promise that every politician has to make in England they boast about who spent more on the health service in which government in an attempt to win over voters the growth in health expenditure has also outpaced the rise in GDP and even general public expenditure the expenditure just keeps going up and up and up and it shows no sign of slowing down spending on the NHS is I mean it's important but the constant commitment to an increase in spending by politicians is just so wrong they're getting this so wrong voters don't care about how much we spend on the health service we just want to know that it's working and clearly it's not clearly spending a fortune on the health service doesn't cut it anymore we need to look at other options that could return the NHS back to its golden days but why is it display increase funding the NHS is getting worse well a sharp increase in migration is partly at play here net migration to the UK which is the most economically significant measure of emigration is huge it's been in the hundreds of thousands since 1998 that's the equivalent of a new city relying on the already struggling NHS resources every year this is an immediate problem especially in that we don't have the infrastructure or the resources ready but it's a long-term problem because we just don't have the cash for it the NHS works by Brits paying into the system through national insurance so as long as you've been paying your taxes you've been contributing to your health care and many put in more than they take out but new immigrants haven't been paying into the NHS as long and yet they still get full access to everything and they'll be treated well into their old age and then they have kids and income their families if expenditure is increasing but the service is declining that tells us the problem goes beyond money this is an access problem and it's not going to get better until we stop and think about what the NHS can reasonably afford to do last year a leading cancer specialist said that health tourism is costing the NHS as much as two billion pounds a year so here's what dr. Marion Thomas said one year ago in The Spectator quote I have become increasingly aware that I was being personally targeted by people who came to the UK with a pre-existing illness whose sole purpose was to claim free NHS care the laxity of the NHS cheques had eventually become famous throughout the world this has to stop the NHS needs staff who are able and ready to identify patients who are ineligible for NHS treatment these people must be identified and made to pay for those services that they access if people come to this country with the sole intention of receiving treatment they should be forced to cough up and cough up a lot or be prosecuted we need tough measures to stop people coming to this country to take advantage of our good nature but the UK also needs to address our growing population and the strain it has on the NHS new immigrants shouldn't come to this country and have full access to our health care right away while people who've been paying into this system all their adult lives have the worst wait times on record something needs to change and it needs to be drastic we must put our own people and resources first and our politicians must just stop throwing money I project that clearly needs to be reformed it's not fair on the patients and it's not fair on the doctors own nurses who have been worked into the ground and made to do the impossible every day watch me and the rest of the rebel team on our brand new app download it now from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store you
