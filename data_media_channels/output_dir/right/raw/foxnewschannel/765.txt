1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:00,943
EXECUTIVE ORDER.

2
00:00:00,943 --> 00:00:01,844
PETE: HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

3
00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:04,313
HE DID BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE

4
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:04,647
TO.

5
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:06,215
ABBY: WE CAN DEBATE THAT.

6
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,617
ED: WE WILL DEBATE THAT ALL

7
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:08,584
MORNING IN TERMS OF WALKING

8
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:09,518
IT BACK AND PRESIDENT

9
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:12,321
DEALING WITH A MEDIA

10
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:13,456
NARRATIVE SET NO MATTER HOW

11
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:14,290
HE REACTED.

12
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,091
LOOK WHAT "TIME" MAGAZINE

13
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:16,792
HAD TO DO.

14
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:18,160
THEY PUT OUT THIS COVER THAT

15
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,762
TRIES TO FRAME THIS IN A WAY

16
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:21,397
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY

17
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,532
NEGATIVE TO THE PRESIDENT'S

18
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:24,033
POSITION.

19
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,870
SCREAMING, CRYING 2-YEAR-OLD

20
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,038
GIRL PRESIDENT OVER HER AS

21
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:32,073
IF HE IS LITERALLY RIPPING

22
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,443
HER FROM MOM WHEN, IN FACT

23
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:35,911
"TIME" MAGAZINE HAS TO RUN A

24
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,746
CORRECTION ABOUT THE STORY.

25
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:37,947
THEY HAVEN'T CORRECTED THE

26
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:38,247
PHOTO.

27
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:38,981
THEY ARE STILL STANDING

28
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:40,049
BEHIND THE IDEA THAT THIS

29
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:41,917
STILL, IN THEIR EYES,

30
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,352
TYPIFIES THE DEBATE.

31
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:45,087
BUT THEY ARE ADMITTING NOW

32
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,322
THAT THIS YOUNG GIRL, 2

33
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:47,757
YEARS OLD WAS NEVER

34
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,825
SEPARATED FROM HER MOM.

35
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:50,993
ABBY: WE ALL SAW THIS

36
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:52,895
2-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO CAME

37
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:54,163
OVER FROM HONDURAS.

38
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:55,665
COME TO FIND NOW SHE WASN'T

39
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:56,499
SEPARATED FROM HER MOM.

40
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:57,700
IN FACT, HER FATHER IS

41
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,801
SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THIS.

42
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,169
HERE'S WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT'S

43
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:01,604
HE SAID YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW

44
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,005
I FELT WHEN I SAW THAT PHOTO

45
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:03,572
OF MY DAUGHTER.

46
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:04,974
IT BROKE MY HEART.

47
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:05,908
IT'S DIFFICULT AS A FATHER

48
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:06,609
TO SEE THAT.

49
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,411
BUT I KNOW NOW THAT THEY ARE

50
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:09,345
NOT IN DANGER.

51
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:11,247
THEY ARE SAFER NOW THAN THEY

52
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:12,715
WERE MAKING THAT JOURNEY TO

53
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,917
THE BORDER.

54
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:16,052
SHE HAS BEEN WITH HER MOTHER

55
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:16,886
THIS WHOLE TIME.

56
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:18,554
THE FATHER ACTUALLY SAYS HE

57
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:19,955
DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE MOTHER

58
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,190
TOOK THE DAUGHTER.

59
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,193
THAT HE WAS NERVOUS ABOUT

60
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:24,560
THAT.

61
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,663
PETE: SAFER NOW THAN THE

62
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:29,031
SHELTER THAN THE JOURNEY OUT

63
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,232
MOM PUT THE KID ON.

64
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:31,267
THERE IS A POINT TO BE MADE

65
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:33,102
AS WELL.

66
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:33,936
ED: SOMETIMES MAKING THE

67
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:36,005
OPPOSITE POINT.

68
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:36,605
PETE: THEY'RE

69
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:40,142
UNINTENTIONALLY MAKING THE

70
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,144
REVERSE POINTS THAT INDEED,

71
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,245
ACTUALLY HERE IN AMERICA

72
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:44,213
SEPARATED NOT SEPARATED YOU

73
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:44,814
ARE CARED FOR.

74
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,283
THE LAWS MATTER.

75
00:01:47,283 --> 00:01:49,552
AND THE PERILOUS JOURNEY YOU

76
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,320
PUT THEM ON IN MEXICO IS A

77
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,955
ROLL OF THE DICE.

78
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,023
ABBY: ALSO THE MESSAGE YOU

79
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:55,191
CAN'T JUST SEE A PHOTO AND

80
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,392
JUMP TO A NARRATIVE.

81
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:57,093
SO IMPORTANT TO

82
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:57,760
UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE

83
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,327
TALKING ABOUT.

84
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,595
IF WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT A

85
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:00,896
PHOTO THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A

86
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:01,931
TERRIBLE SITUATION, LET'S

87
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,632
MAKE SURE WE BACK IT UP WITH

88
00:02:03,632 --> 00:02:04,867
SOME FACTS AND KNOW THE

89
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:08,838
ACTUAL STORY BEHIND IT.

90
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:09,472
ED: "TIME" MAGAZINE ABOUT

91
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,705
THIS LAST NIGHT HAD SOMEBODY

92
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:11,974
SHOOT BACK AT ME NICE

93
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,776
STANDING BEHIND YOUR FELLOW

94
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,310
JOURNALISTS.

95
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,678
I BASICALLY SAID HOW WHY

96
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,780
STAND BEHIND BASICALLY A

97
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,347
FAKE PHOTO.

98
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,715
LIKE, THAT'S NOT STANDING

99
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:22,084
BEHIND JOURNALISM IT'S

100
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:23,385
SIMPLY NOT.

101
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,720
PETE: YOU ARE STANDING FOR

102
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,421
JOURNALISM, RIGHT?

103
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,789
FRAME THE STORY ACCURATELY

104
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,090
AND IF IN FACT, ABBY IS

105
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,792
RIGHT WHAT SHE SAID A MINUTE

106
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:30,059
AGO.

107
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,494
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT

108
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:32,528
THE PRESIDENT DID WALK THIS

109
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,362
BACK A BIT.

110
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,131
HE HAD TO REVERSE HIMSELF BY

111
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:35,931
SIGNING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.

112
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:37,066
IF THE OTHER SIDE FROM THE

113
00:02:37,066 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT THEY
