President Trump is prepared to fight a possible Muller subpoena all the way to the Supreme Court as they say if it comes to that that is according to new reporting tonight from the Washington Post the Trump legal team is still waiting for the special counsel to respond to their interview conditions but the post Robert Costa who joins us in just a moment reports the quote in the meantime Trump's lawyers are preparing to oppose a potential subpoena from Muller for a trump sit-down by drafting a rebuttal that could set off a dramatic fight in federal courts that news comes as Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani ratchets up his public relations campaign trying to pressure Muller to wrap this investigation up before the midterm elections Giuliani told Bloomberg today if he doesn't get it done in the next two or three weeks we will just unload on him like a ton of bricks more on that later he added write the damn report so we can see it and rebut it as for the investigation the president couldn't resist weighing in yet again today and he employed some of the classics the rigged Russian witch-hunt goes on and on as the originators and founders of this scam continue to be fired up and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity all credibility has gone from this terrible hoax capital H and much more will be lost as it proceeds no collusion capital C and a reminder that so far the Muller investigation has resulted in 35 indictments including dozens of Russians and members of the president's campaign here with us tonight to talk about all of it Robert Costa national political reporter for The Washington Post and moderator in his spare time of Washington week on PBS and Mimi Roca is back with us former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York now a distinguished fellow and criminal justice at the Pace University School of Law so Bob I'd like to begin with you you spoke with Mayor Giuliani earlier today what is his state of mind and what did you infer is the state of play he's watching the clock Brian he knows a week ago he and Jay Sekulow the other Trump Attorney sent a letter to Muller in essence refusing an interview by the President and had anything to do with questions about obstruction of justice they're still waiting for Muller to respond and they're trying to see if Muller is going to issue a subpoena to the president and they're preparing for that scenario of writing a rebuttal now so it's ready that they can issue immediately to start a court fight to fight it at the district court level at the circuit court level and ultimately perhaps at the Supreme Court counselor where is this leverage coming from that rudy guiliani appears to when they say things like will come down upon you like a ton of bricks where are they getting that in the balance of power he has no leverage and you know hearing Giuliani talk like that to robert muller he reminds me far more one of the mobsters that he used to prosecute and that i used to prosecute than he does of a defense attorney of any standing and you know people in the US Attorney's Office and in criminal defense bar like to say your reputation is everything because you know as you go on to do cases you you carry with you the case you did before and what any lawyer you dealt with well Giuliani apparently has just completely given up on his reputation and his credibility for a former US Attorney to talk like that to and about Robert Muller who whatever he may think or want to say about this investigation you know has led this life of public service and been dedicated to his countries is really it's shameful I think it's bordering on unethical and I think this this latest statement you know really sounds again borderline obstruction and you're of the opinion that Muller doesn't necessarily need Trump one-to-one yeah I don't think that he look it Muller has far more experience than I do so he'll decide if he needs him if it were me at this point I think you know part of this was just giving Trump the opportunity to come in and explain himself so that if and when you know there are charges a report that's unfavorable to him he can't say he didn't get a chance to do that I think that Muller has given him that opportunity he's thumbed his nose repaired lis at it and he should go ahead without it and not let them run out the clock the way they're trying to by this you know pretend negotiation over an interview and this supposed you know we're going to fight a subpoena I think legally Moeller would win that that court battle if it was you know if that's how it played out I also think it would muzzle Giuliani because once you're in court a judge is not gonna let Julie on and go out and talk like this as a lawyer who has a proceeding pending in court but I don't think Muller needs it and that's you know my opinion based on the little I know and I would just go ahead without it Robert this this is out of balance like all the passengers on a plane moving to one side all we hear is the Giuliani Trump side Muller never speaks never leaks so when Rudolph Giuliani says he thinks Muller is waiting for the disposition of the manna for trial when he thinks they're waiting to see if it's guilty or innocent is that real it's real to a point but I think the previous point about how Muller could issue a report any moment in my conversation tonight with Mayor Giuliani that really stood out because he acknowledged pretty bluntly that that is a possibility that Muller could decide enough of the games between the Trump team and Muller and all this back and forth the letter sending about the interview the longer Mahler holds off on a letter back to the Trump legal team the more it becomes a possibility in Giuliani said this is that this is certainly a possibility that Mahler just drops the report drops the report as an update on the investigation gives it to the Department of Justice and rod Rosenstein and say that now it's your decision how you want to handle this maybe you want to update Congress and what progress we've made on the conduct of the president that part of the investigation hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click
