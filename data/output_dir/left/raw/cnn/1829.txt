1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,490
we're back with our politics lead now
president Trump is pitching his tax

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,389
reform plan in North Dakota just one of
a slew of competing priorities the White

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,340
House is hoping to pass through Congress
earlier today the president quote

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,770
blindsided Republican congressional
leaders according to a Republican

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,480
official by quickly agreeing with
Democrats on a plan to tie funding for

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,289
Harvey recovery to a three-month
extension on the country's debt limit

7
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,460
and a stopgap spending bill the
Democratic proposal House Speaker Paul

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,750
Ryan had just hours before called
ridiculous which leads us to another

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,399
episode of is there a tweet for that is
there something in the vast reservoir of

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,170
Trump tweet archives that has him
criticizing the exact same thing he did

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,940
today you already know the answer here's
Donald Trump in 2013 quote the worst

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,510
negotiators in history otherwise known
as Republicans have just offered to

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,579
suspend debt ceiling for four months
pathetic CNN White House correspondent

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,420
Sarah Murray has more on a move that
blindsided the president's own party in

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,689
Congress we have a lot to discuss
including the fact that there's a new

16
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,400
and seems to be record-breaking
hurricane heading right toward Florida

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,740
in Puerto Rico with another hurricane
bearing down on the US president Trump

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,180
is reaching across the aisle to prove he
can strike a deal on disaster relief for

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,810
hurricane Harvey and avoid a fiscal
crisis we essentially came to a deal and

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,820
I think the deal will be very good
waiter very very cordial and

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,500
professional meeting Trump starting with
Democrats today we had a very good

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,079
meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck
Schumer and ignoring the protests of GOP

23
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,549
leaders and Treasury secretary Steve
minutiae as he threw his support behind

24
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,750
bundling Harvey disaster relief with a
three-month proposal to raise the debt

25
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,070
limit and a three-month stopgap spending
bill everyone is in favor obviously of

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,659
taking care of that situation so we
offer a much agree Trump confirmed the

27
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,280
deal just hours after House Speaker Paul
Ryan panned the Democrats proposal on

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,878
the hill I think that's a ridiculous and
disgraceful that they want to pluck play

29
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,390
politics with the debt ceiling at this
moment Trump's move comes on the heels

30
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,030
of a meeting with
congressional leaders at the White House

31
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:21,000
on a day when Democrats had been
fiercely critical of the president the

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,690
wake of his decision to end the
so-called daca program president's

33
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:32,430
decision to end daca was heartless and
it was brainless hours after the Trump

34
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,270
administration announced it was ending a
program that protected young people from

35
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,100
deportation if they were brought to the
US illegally as children Trump appeared

36
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,240
to be looking for some wiggle room
tweeting Congress now has six months to

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,580
legalize daca if they can't I will
revisit this issue today Trump insisted

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,760
he wasn't muddying the waters Mexico
Congress I really believe wants to take

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,780
care of the situation and said he's
hoping to sign legislation that protects

40
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,070
the dreamers and be stopped border
security I'd like to see something where

41
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:11,580
we have good border security and we have
a great daca transaction where everybody

42
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,630
is happy as Trump navigates a jam-packed
domestic agenda

43
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,750
he's also juggling escalating tensions
with more Korea

44
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,920
he spoke today with Chinese President Xi
who's holding out hope North Korea will

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,410
back away from its nuclear weapons
program he's very much in favor of the D

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,220
nuke of North Korea and we're talking
about different things as for president

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,130
Trump he's still not ruling out a
military option

48
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,609
now the president was speaking in North
Dakota he referred back to that meeting

49
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,849
he had with congressional leaders
earlier today and insisted that everyone

50
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,920
left happy not too happy because you can
never be too happy in those scenarios

51
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,599
but insisting that both Republicans and
Democrats are fine with that deal Trump

52
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,379
is in North Dakota to sell tax reform
we'll see how eager Republicans are to

53
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,530
work with him after the stunt he pulled
at the White House today Jake all right

54
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,168
Sarah Murray at the White House let's
talk about the president agreeing with

55
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,129
congressional Democrats on how to move
forward with our panel Kevin Paul Ryan

56
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,669
this morning called the Democrats plan
to tie these hoods together ridiculous

57
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:30,120
and disgraceful fast forward a few hours
President Trump says deal shrewd what do

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,360
you think no I think it was totally
reflexive I was joking around with Nia

59
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,590
reminded me of when Cramer went in with
Jackie child's on the episode of

60
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,550
Seinfeld and they were supposed to get
$50,000 and all the free coffee and he

61
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,259
accepts the deal right as he says free
coffee and it just it seemed very

62
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,639
reactionary it was not very well thought
out there are a lot of people unhappy up

63
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,409
on Capitol Hill but there's also a sense
of resignation which is that's the deal

64
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,099
that we're going to have to go forward
with let's see what we can do and at

65
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:03,000
least maybe we can get some more floor
time now so that we can manage some of

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,840
the efforts on tax reform and then let's
put up this photograph that was caught

67
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,130
through the oval office window of
President Trump and Chuck Schumer there

68
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,840
it is it looks like they're goofing
around after this deal was cut and

69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,080
actually you know there are a lot of
people who before the president took

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,620
office who thought these two probably
can work fairly well together they're

71
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,699
New York dealmakers Trump at one point
was a huge contributor to Chuck Schumer

72
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,470
and we saw that side of Trump today if
only briefly

73
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,039
well that's true he's probably also a
better time than Mitch McConnell so

74
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,970
perhaps there's a low bar you know he
may not feel that way president Trump

75
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,580
once he realizes that he was probably
rolled today by the Democrats who knew

76
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,509
that having two votes on the debt limit
means there's two votes that are must

77
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,650
pass pieces of legislation that they
have opportunities to try to attach

78
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,800
something like the DREAM Act to and
they've been pretty vocal about that

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,469
since this deal was cut but we'll see if
he says the same love and almost embrace

80
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,650
for Chuck Schumer
after he sees the coverage now the spin

81
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,860
that I'm hearing from the legislative
director of the White House is that this

82
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,080
move by the president clears the deck
for tax reform there is a case to be

83
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,580
made for that it clears the decks I mean
in there's this legislative logjam right

84
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,220
and so rolling all this stuff together
does clear the decks protection from a

85
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,479
number of things that have to get done
as well chip renewing that on defense

86
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,720
bill as well so the calendar is so
packed so yeah and that's what you heard

87
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,690
Mitch McConnell say to essentially say
that's the argument that the president

88
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,770
made and that's what they accepted you
know I think is some Republicans who

89
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,870
I've talked to said this is basically
emblematic of the president's distaste

90
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,349
for Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan he
essentially went into the Oval Office

91
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:50,220
and kicked them in the gut in Mitch
McConnell and somebody look like that

92
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,729
when he was talking today like this was
something that was very surprising to

93
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:57,449
him and so here he is now not only
cutting this deal immediately with

94
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,580
Democrats but then flying off to North
Dakota with Heidi Heitkamp in seeming to

95
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,659
suggest that this might be sort of a new
strategy cutting deals with Democrats

96
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:11,729
perhaps on daca as well so I mean we'll
see if this is a new strategy from this

97
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,880
president but Republicans I talked to
certainly not happy about it all right

98
00:07:14,880 --> 00:00:00,000
everyone
