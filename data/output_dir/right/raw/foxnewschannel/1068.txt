1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,254
DIFFERENT FORM, IT COULD BE WITH

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,391
CANADA, WITH MEXICO.

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,426
ONE-ON-ONE, AND, A MUCH SIMPLER

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,029
AGREEMENT.

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,998
>> GOOD EVENING.

6
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:16,033
EVEN BEFORE LEAVING THE

7
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,034
WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT RAISE

8
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,135
A FEW EYEBROWS AROUND THE GLOBE

9
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:20,204
BY SUGGESTING RUSSIA SHOULD BE

10
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:23,207
HERE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS.

11
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:24,908
JUST THE LATEST REMINDER OF HIS

12
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:27,044
UNCONVENTIONAL STYLE, AND TO

13
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:29,513
SOME OF HIS IMPRUDENT RATE

14
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:30,614
APPROACH GLOBAL POLITICS.

15
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,949
>> COME I CAN SPEAK TO WHETHER

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,621
YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, AND WHETHER

17
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,223
OR NOT IT'S POLITICALLY

18
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:41,425
CORRECT, WE HAVE A WORLD TO RUN.

19
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:44,928
AND OF THE G7, WHICH USED TO BE

20
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:46,430
G8, THROUGH RUSH OUT.

21
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,497
THEY SHOULD LET RUSSIA COME BACK

22
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:49,633
AGAIN BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE

23
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,236
RUSSIA AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

24
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:54,071
>> IT WAS QUINTESSENTIAL TRUMP.

25
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,807
IT REVERBERATED ACROSS THE GLOBE

26
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,009
AND CAROMED ACROSS THE PARTISAN

27
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,077
POLITICAL DIVIDE HERE AT HOME.

28
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:01,812
>> President Trump: WHY ARE WE

29
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,647
HAVING A MEETING WITHOUT RUSSIA

30
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,015
BEING IN THE MEETING?

31
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,650
I WOULD RECOMMEND, AND IT'S UP

32
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,820
TO THEM, BUT RUSSIA SHOULD BE IN

33
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,220
THE MEETING.

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,954
>> Reporter: RUSSIA WAS KICKED

35
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,891
OUT OF THE G8 BECAUSE IT INVADED

36
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,759
UKRAINE, AND ANNEXED CRIMEA.

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,494
THE PRESIDENT SENTIMENT LET

38
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,796
RUSSIA SHOULD BE PART OF THE

39
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:19,897
GATHERING IN QUEBEC CLEARLY AT

40
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:21,865
ODDS WITH MANY IN HIS OWN PARTY

41
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:23,867
AND KEY ALLIES FROM AROUND THE

42
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,335
WORLD, INCLUDING THE U.K. WHICH

43
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,236
REALLY DON'T LIKE IT WEIGHED IN

44
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,972
WITH THE STATEMENT THAT READ, IN

45
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:31,075
PART, THE PRIME MINISTER'S HAS

46
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:32,676
ALWAYS SAID WE SHOULD ENGAGE

47
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,477
WITH RUSSIA BUT BEWARE.

48
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:35,679
WE HAVE SEEN THE LINE FROM

49
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,481
RUSSIA IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.

50
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,149
BEFORE ANY CONVERSATIONS COULD

51
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:39,750
TAKE PLACE ABOUT RUSSIA

52
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,419
REJOINING, IT NEEDS TO CHANGE

53
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:43,187
ITS APPROACH.

54
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,588
ONCE ON THE GROUND IN QUEBEC,

55
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,924
THE PRESIDENT STOOD WITH WORLD

56
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:47,925
LEADERS FOR THE TRADITIONAL

57
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,127
FAMILY PHOTO, THOUGH THE SMILE

58
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,328
SEEMED TO BELIE THE TENSION

59
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,362
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

60
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,331
JUST AHEAD OF THE CEMENT, THE

61
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,100
PRESIDENT RAGED ON TWITTER ABOUT

62
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,168
UNFAIR TRADE AND COME CALLING

63
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,404
OUT AMERICA'S AIR ALLIES FOR

64
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:03,207
THEIR STEEP TARIFFS ON AMERICAN

65
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,007
GOODS LIKE CANADA'S STEEP TARIFF

66
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,410
ON DAIRY.

67
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,412
HIS COUNTERPARTS FIRED BACK,

68
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,713
THREATENING TO GO IT ALONE IF

69
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,816
THE U.S. LAND MEMBERS WITH STEEP

70
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:15,619
TARIFFS.

71
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:16,653
>> Translator: THE

72
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:17,621
UNITED STATES ARE NATURALLY A

73
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:20,190
GREAT ECONOMIC POWER BUT IF THEY

74
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,226
CONTINUED TOWARDS A FORM OF

75
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:22,860
ISOLATIONISM, DISTANCING

76
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,628
THEMSELVES FROM THEIR OWN

77
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:25,929
HISTORY, FROM THEIR OWN VALUES,

78
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,965
FROM THE ROLE THEY PLAY IN

79
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,266
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,

80
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:32,503
THAT WILL BE BAD FOR THE

81
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:33,403
>> Reporter: BY GOING IT ALONE

82
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,905
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR THE REST

83
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,640
OF THE GROUP, CONSIDERING THE

84
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,277
U.S. GDP FOR 2018 IS EXPECTED TO

85
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:40,778
TOP $20 TRILLION.

86
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,046
THAT'S MORE THAN THE OTHER

87
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:43,647
MEMBERS COMBINED.

88
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:44,615
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS COME FROM

89
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:46,283
THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO

90
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:47,584
LEAVE THE SUMMIT HOURS EARLIER

91
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,153
THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO MAKE

92
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:51,488
WAY FOR THE NORTH KOREAN SUMMIT

93
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:52,089
IN SINGAPORE.

94
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,757
A VISIT WHICH HAS STOKED

95
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,892
CONCERNS ON CAPITOL HILL THAT

96
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:58,195
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT TRY TO AND

97
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:00,364
RUN CONGRESS TO FORGE A DEAL IN

98
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,032
THE SAME MANNER THAT HIS

99
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,334
PREDECESSOR DID WITH THE IRAN

100
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:04,935
NUCLEAR ACCORD.

101
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,236
>> President Trump: I WOULDN'T

102
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,204
DO LIKE OBAMA DID.

103
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:09,940
YOU KNOW, HE TRIED TO GET IT

104
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,607
THROUGH, THE IRAN DEAL.

105
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,209
HE TRIED TO GET IT THROUGH

106
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,279
CONGRESS BUT FAILED SO HE JUST

107
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,046
DID IT WITHOUT.

108
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,448
>> Reporter: EARLIER THIS

109
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,882
EVENING, THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED

110
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,217
THAT A JOINT STATEMENT WITH

111
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:21,685
CANADA ON TERRACE WAS STILL VERY

112
00:03:21,685 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKELY AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS
