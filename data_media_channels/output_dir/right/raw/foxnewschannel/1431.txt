1
00:00:00,958 --> 00:00:01,559
CANCELED.

2
00:00:01,559 --> 00:00:03,994
BOTTOM LINE, MARTHA, IT MAY BE

3
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:04,662
GETTING BACK ON TRACK.

4
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:06,997
>> Martha: WAIT AND WATCH, SO

5
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:07,865
FASCINATING.

6
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:09,433
JOHN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

7
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:12,136
HERE ARE NOW IN A STORY

8
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:13,204
EXCLUSIVE, NEWLY CONFIRMED

9
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:17,107
AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY, RIC

10
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:17,441
GRENELL.

11
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:19,543
AMBASSADOR, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

12
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:22,146
DO YOU THINK THIS SINGAPORE

13
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:22,680
SUMMIT WILL HAPPEN?

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,683
>> I THINK AS PRESIDENT TRUMP

15
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:27,918
SAID, WAIT AND SEE.

16
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:31,388
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS

17
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:32,389
FRUSTRATED MANY ADMINISTRATIONS

18
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:33,123
BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,

19
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:36,160
AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,494
ACTION THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER

21
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:38,896
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS.

22
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,931
THIS ALL STARTED FROM

23
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:43,100
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOING REALLY

24
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,934
TOUGH DIPLOMACY WITH THE

25
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:44,268
CHINESE.

26
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:47,338
WE HAVE SEEN THE CHINESE RAISED

27
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,206
THEIR HAND FOR SANCTIONS AT THE

28
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:51,742
U.N. MULTIPLE TIMES, AND YET,

29
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:53,444
NOT REALLY IMPLEMENT THOSE

30
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,545
THINGS.

31
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:55,546
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DATA EARLY

32
00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:56,680
ON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION WAS

33
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,048
SIGNAL THAT DIPLOMACY WAS GOING

34
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:02,987
TO BE TOUGH, AND HE PRESSURED

35
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:04,288
THE CHINESE TO ACTUALLY

36
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:04,989
IMPLEMENT THE SANCTIONS THAT

37
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,993
THEY HAD VOTED FOR PREVIOUSLY,

38
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:10,561
IN CONSECUTIVE YEARS.

39
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:13,764
SO WHAT WE SAW PRETTY QUICKLY

40
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:14,832
WAS, ONCE THE CHINESE DECIDED TO

41
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:18,435
IMPLEMENT THE SANCTIONS, WE SAW

42
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:18,969
ACTION.

43
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,838
WE SAW THE NORTH KOREANS FEEL

44
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:23,407
THE SQUEEZE, FEEL THE SQUEEZE OF

45
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:24,575
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DIPLOMACY, AND

46
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,944
COME TO THE TABLE.

47
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:29,380
NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE CLEAR EYES

48
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,581
AND WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

49
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:32,349
BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT THIS

50
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:33,417
PRESIDENT KNOWS HOW TO

51
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:34,184
NEGOTIATE.

52
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:37,187
I HAVE SEEN HIM NEGOTIATE AND HE

53
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:39,390
ALSO KNOWS HOW TO REALLY USE

54
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,692
BOTH THE CARROT AND THE STICK,

55
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:42,893
IF YOU WILL, AND HE'S BEEN VERY

56
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,362
SUCCESSFUL AT THAT.

57
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:46,130
>> Martha: THAT IS WHAT WE ARE

58
00:01:46,130 --> 00:02:01,145
SEEING WITH THE CTE DEAL, WHICH

59
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:01,879
YOU WONDER IF IT ISN'T GETTING

60
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,914
BACK ON TRACK.

61
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:05,549
>> HE HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO

62
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,884
FIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

63
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:08,919
AND USE ALL OF THE TOOLS THAT

64
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,553
THE GOVERNMENT HAS.

65
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:11,755
NOT JUST MAKE ONE ARGUMENT BUT

66
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:14,258
HE WILL SAY AS HE SAID TO

67
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:16,760
PRESIDENT XI EARLY ON, IF YOU

68
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,761
HELP OUT WITH NORTH KOREA WHICH

69
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:20,164
IS A VERY SERIOUS POLICY FOR US,

70
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:21,765
A THREAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

71
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:22,466
IF YOU HELP US OUT ON

72
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,835
NORTH KOREA, HE WILL BE ABLE TO

73
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:27,972
GET A BETTER TRADE DEAL FROM US.

74
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,940
THOSE TYPES OF NEGOTIATION

75
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,175
SKILLS, TO INTERMINGLE MULTIPLE

76
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:33,344
ISSUES, I THINK IT IS A

77
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,412
FANTASTIC WAY TO NEGOTIATE.

78
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,614
I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME TO SEE A

79
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:38,749
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY USE ALL OF

80
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:41,385
THE TOOLS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

81
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:42,519
HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL, AND THIS

82
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,288
PRESIDENT HAS SHOWN HE IS

83
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,056
WILLING TO DO THAT.

84
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,392
>> Martha: I WANT TO PUT UP A

85
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:50,527
TWEET THAT YOU SENT MAY 8TH,

86
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,730
RIGHT AFTER YOU BEGAN YOUR

87
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,998
AMBASSADORSHIP IN BERLIN.

88
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:56,200
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, U.S.

89
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,168
SANCTIONS WILL START TO TARGET

90
00:02:58,168 --> 00:02:58,969
IRAN.

91
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,772
U.S. COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN

92
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:02,773
IRAN SHOULD WIND DOWN OPERATIONS

93
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,174
IMMEDIATELY.

94
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,376
THERE'S LOTS OF CORPORATE

95
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,410
ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN EUROPE AND

96
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,179
IRAN AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

97
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:11,415
WANT TO UNWIND THAT AMBASSADOR.

98
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:12,983
>> I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

99
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:15,753
VERY CLEAR ABOUT U.S. SANCTIONS

100
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:16,387
ON IRAN.

101
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:19,056
AND HE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT

102
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:20,190
COMPANIES GET TO CHOOSE.

103
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,059
THEY CAN EITHER CHOOSE TO DO

104
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,394
BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES,

105
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:24,995
OR THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO

106
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,497
BUSINESS WITH IRAN BUT, THEY

107
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,399
WON'T GET TO DIVORCE.

108
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,800
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN CLEAR

109
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,802
ABOUT THAT AND SECRETARY POMPEO

110
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:32,636
HAS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

111
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,204
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE

112
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:35,739
THROUGHOUT EUROPE ARE COMPANIES

113
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,708
TELLING US THAT, OF COURSE THEY

114
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,842
ARE GOING TO CHOOSE THE

115
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:39,276
UNITED STATES.

116
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:42,446
WHEN FORCED TO MAKE A DECISION

117
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,048
ABOUT CHOOSING EITHER DOING

118
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:53,957
BUSINESS WITH THE MOLA, OR THE

119
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:54,558
UNITED STATES, IT'S THE

120
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:56,160
DIPLOMAT'S DUTY TO FOLLOW THE

121
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,461
DIRECTIVES AND POLICIES AND BE

122
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:57,828
OUT FRONT.

123
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,930
ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS

124
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,165
PRESENT THAT CHOICE TO

125
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,333
BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT EUROPE.

126
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,769
IT IS THEIR CHOICE, THEY CAN

127
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,171
DECIDE WHICH GOVERNMENT OR WHICH

128
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:09,373
MARKET THEY ARE GOING TO WANT TO

129
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:11,975
PLAY IN, AND AT THE END OF THE

130
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,978
DAY, WHATEVER THEY CHOOSE IS

131
00:04:14,978 --> 00:00:00,000
THEIR DECISION.
