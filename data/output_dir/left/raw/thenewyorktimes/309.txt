1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,800
When I looked at my
mother, my grandmother,

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,720
and my great grandmother, I just
saw women who were burdened.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,980
Women who weren’t free.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,360
I was just intent on having
another kind of life.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,160
My mother is the
youngest of eight.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,750
Her dream was always to travel
the world playing her music.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,220
She was 16 when she
married my father.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:41,420
He was abusive and we moved
back into my grandparents’ home.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,430
My mom worked long hours.

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,480
She was always stressed.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,470
She ended up pregnant three
times after she left my father.

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,110
She said she just didn’t
believe in abortion

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,700
and she was going to
have each of the babies.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,260
I didn’t want to be her,

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,879
someone like her, 
stuck in that town.

16
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,419
I wanted to get out of 
De Ridder and go to college.

17
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:12,940
I remember having
this dream of having

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:19,260
a flat in Europe or some
studio apartment in New York.

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,910
He told his
stepfather and his mom

20
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,540
that we were going
to the state fair.

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,440
There was a woman
sitting there waiting.

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,120
I just remember her looking
at me and saying,

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,420
“Don’t worry.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,640
This is my fifth one.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
It doesn’t hurt.”

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,890
I couldn’t even process it
mentally or emotionally.

27
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,100
I felt that I had
let everyone down

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,050
and they didn’t even know it.

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,420
On the way home, I got in
the backseat and just slept.

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,050
I married a man who
did not want kids.

31
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,080
I said,

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,730
“I like children, but
I just, I don’t want them.”

33
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,610
And I still don’t feel that
just because you’re a woman,

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,380
you’re supposed to have kids.

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,820
But around 30, 31, something
within me started changing.

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,420
Why did I make the
decision not to have kids?

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,760
I was definitely
in deep conflict.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,300
We ended up going
our separate ways.

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,357
I was watching something on
television about abortion.

40
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:33,710
I just hadn’t allowed
myself to really think

41
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,060
about that baby
and that pregnancy.

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,050
Just the floodgate opened.

43
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,990
I thought about how
old the child would

44
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,310
have been at that point and,
oh my God, what kind of mother

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,650
would I have been?

46
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,115
I met a guy.

47
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,620
He was a single father.

48
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,850
We hit it off, and I must have
been pregnant by that fall.

49
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,120
It felt surreal.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,240
Something about it
also felt very natural.

51
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:15,830
When I think about my
mother, my grandmother,

52
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,150
my great grandmother, motherhood
is something that just happened

53
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,930
or seemed to happen to them.

54
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,800
I stepped in and
ended that, but I also

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,720
am very saddened by having
to make that choice.

56
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,500
I’m proud of the
life that I’ve been

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,950
able to craft and the freedom
that I’ve had because I’m

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,790
able to share that with my son.

59
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:56,333
We finally went to see a
reproductive endocrinologist.

60
00:03:58,811 --> 00:00:00,000
At 30, I had no eggs.
