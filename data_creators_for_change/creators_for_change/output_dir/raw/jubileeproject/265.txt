2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jubilee project hope you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,910
doing well this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video</font>

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually for the 5k as we haven't run</font>

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,740
yet will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be wanting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Saturday which is</font>

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
luck but the reason for this video is

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,030
actually put a date on your calendar and

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,840
that day is april eighth 2010 april

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,240
eighth is a day without shoes sponsored

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,670
by toms shoes and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that they</font>

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,769
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get people around the world to</font>

12
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,500
spend a day without shoes like this can

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,730
be your entire name this can be a

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,159
portion of your day whatever but the

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,710
reason is to grow awareness for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,880
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of children throughout</font>

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
developing countries who grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up without</font>

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,739
shoes and apparently this crowd causes a

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,300
lot of serious problems for them growing

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,390

21
