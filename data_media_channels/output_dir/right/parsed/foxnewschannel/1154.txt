AND I WISH I DID.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO NOTED, NO
CHANGES ON THE HORIZON.
>> INTERESTING TALE.
MY NEXT GUEST IS PART OF THE
PRESIDENT'S INNER CIRCLE.
BRAD PARR SCALE WAS CITED AS ONE
OF THE MASTERMINDS BEHIND
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VICTORY SENT
SERVING AS THE CAMPAIGN'S
DIGITAL DIRECTOR.
NOW HE'S TAKEN THE HELM AND
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WILL GET TO
IN JUST A MOMENT.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
HOW DIFFICULT DOES THAT STUFF
MAKE YOUR JOB?
IN TERMS OF THE TWEETS AND THE
JEFF SESSIONS ISSUE?
>> I DON'T THINK I MAKE MY JOB
ANY MORE DIFFICULT.
I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH
DEATH.MICHAEL JEFF SESSIONS, I
WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR0
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR5
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR.
IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR MYSELF
AS WELL.
KNOWS AS MUCH AS I DO THAT THERE
WAS NO COLLUSION AND HE WAS
THERE, HE WAS AROUND.
IT WASN'T LIKE HE WAS IN THERE
MAKING LARGE DECISIONS BUT HE
WAS WATCHING.
IT IS A DISAPPOINTMENT, AND I'M
100% THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS
GOING TO RECUSE HIMSELF, HE
WOULD HAVE CHOSEN SOMEONE ELSE.
SOME OF THAT NATURE WE COULD
MOVE ON FROM THIS.
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK HE
SHOULD RESIGN?
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT, WE NEED
TO FINISH THE JOB AT HAND IT
NOW.
I THINK WHEN THE FINAL REPORTS
COME OUT AND THEY SAY THERE IS
NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
IS LEGITIMATE AND WE FINALLY
COME TO THESE CONCLUSIONS, THE
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE ANY
CONCLUSION HE WANTS TO.
>> Martha: IT'S INTERESTING
TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU RAN
THE WHOLE DIGITAL PART OF THE
CAMPAIGN, ADVERTISING THESE
REMOTE PLACES WHERE YOU HADN'T
SEEN VOTERS TURN OUT THE WAY
THEY DID BEFORE THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN.
SO I KNOW IT'S ESPECIALLY
FRUSTRATING FOR YOU TO HEAR THAT
THE RUSSIANS SORT OF SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO THROW THE CAMPAIGN TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WERE
DOING, DIDN'T YOU INTERSECT AT
SOME POINT, IF THEY WERE PUTTING
ALL THESE ADS OUT ON TWITTER AND
FACEBOOK, AND YOU ARE DOING THE
SAME THING?
>> IT'S LIKE SEEING A LIGHT RAIN
STORM IN ONE PART OF THE CITY
FLOODED THE OTHER PARTS OF THE
CITY.
IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN.
BUT THEY DID WAS A COUPLE OF
RAINDROPS INSIDE OF A WATERFALL
OF THINGS THAT WERE OCCURRING
FROM LEGITIMATE SOURCES AND PAID
CAMPAIGNS.
I CONTINUE TO SEE THIS AS A
POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.
THE PRESIDENT IS 100% RIGHT WITH
ALL THAT.
REGARDLESS OF WHAT SOME PEOPLE
MAY HAVE DONE TEN YEARS AGO, IT
DOESN'T MATTER.
THE CAMPAIGN WAS RUN EVERY DAY
AS A LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN.
>> Martha: I THOUGHT IT WAS
INTERESTING, BEN ROACH JUST
WROTE A BOOK.
IN THE BOOK, HE SAID THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TO HIM,
THAT WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO GO TO
MICHIGAN TO CAMPAIGN IN OCTOBER,
THAT HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.
>> YEAH.
WELL I THINK THE FINAL ANSWER
WAS WHEN SHE CANCELED HER
FIREWORK DISPLAY.
THEY ALL STARTED SCRAMBLING AT
THE END.
WE JUST HAD BETTER DATA.
THEY HAD RUN AN OPERATION THAT
WAS SOPHISTICATED FOR THAT TIME.
OF WHAT WE KNOW NOW.
THE KIND OF THINGS THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
CAN TELL US NOW, WE CAN SEE THE
FUTURE OF HOW THESE VOTING
SCORES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND
WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SMART
DECISIONS, SO WE DID THAT.
>> Martha: THERE ARE SOME
AREAS THAT PEOPLE SAY ARE
POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES FOR
THE PRESIDENT.
SUBURBAN VOTERS, SUBURBAN WOMEN
OUTSIDE OF THE NATION'S BIG
CITIES WHO ENDED UP VOTING FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND WHETHER OR
NOT THEY DO THIS THIS TIME
AROUND.
BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS, THE
FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF
AMERICA THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT.
YOU SAY THE DATA SO FAR LOOKS
REALLY GOOD.
WHAT ABOUT THOSE GROUPS?
HOW DO YOU GET THEM TO TURN OUT?
>> THE FIRST IS, THE DATA HAS
NEVER LOOKED BETTER FOR THE
PRESIDENT.
WE HAVE RUN THE LARGEST DATE
OPERATION SURVEY WORK IN THE
COUNTRY AND WE SEE THAT AMERICA
IS STARTING TO SEE THAT THEIR
PERSONAL ECONOMIES ARE GETTING
BETTER, NATIONAL SECURITY IS
GETTING BETTER.
AND I THINK THEY ARE STARTING TO
SEE IF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
AS MUCH AS THE MEDIA DOESN'T
WANT OUTSIDE OF A COUPLE OF
STATIONS AND A COUPLE PEOPLE,
HOW MUCH THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THEY ARE
STARTING TO GET THROUGH.
ONE OF THOSE THINGS I'M
INTRODUCING IS, A FEW
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, ALMOST 24-36
HOURS, AND IN 500 DAYS THEY HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH.
HE HAS TURBOCHARGE THE ECONOMY,
AND THE REGULATIONS WERE KILLING
JOBS.
AND PEOPLE CAN GO THROUGH AND
SEE, THE MEDIA DOESN'T TALK
ABOUT THOSE THINGS.
I THINK WHEN SUBURBAN PEOPLE SEE
THAT, AND THEY SEE THIS PERSONAL
ECONOMY AND IMPROVEMENT, THEY
CAN BUT THEIR KID IN A BALLERINA
CLASS, THEY CAN BUY A NEW CAR,
THEY CAN DO THESE THINGS.
>> AND I THINK PEOPLE DO CARE
FIRST AND FOREMOST ABOUT HOW
THEY ARE DOING AND NOT SO MUCH
ABOUT THESE ISSUES THAT WE CARE.
BUT BACK TO THE MESSAGE, DOES IT
FRUSTRATE YOU AS A PERSON WHO IS
IN CHARGE OF THE MESSAGE GOING
FORWARD, BUT WHEN IT GETS MOCKED
UP WITH ALL THE STUFF ABOUT JEFF
SESSIONS?
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN
THESE SUBURBAN AREAS WHO ARE
WATCHING ALL THAT AND KIND OF
WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THE
WHEELS ARE COMING OFF.
>> IS REAL BEFORE THIS I WAS A
VERY POLITICAL.
IN WASHINGTON, D.C., YOU REALLY
LEARN WHAT A BUBBLE IS.
PEOPLE SEE SO MUCH, AND WHEN
AMERICA COMES FROM IN SUBURBAN
PHILADELPHIA, THEY ARE SAYING,
HOW AM I GOING TO PAY MY CAR
PAYMENT?
HOW DO I GET MY KID TO A SOCCER
CAMP TONIGHT?
THE NOISE LEVEL IS A LOT LESS
AND WHAT THEY GO FOR IT IS THE
THINGS THAT REALLY AFFECT THEM.
WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT IT IS, THE
MORE THEY DO IT, THE MORE TRUMP
CONTINUES TO RISE.
>> Martha: LET ME ASK YOU THIS
BEFORE I LET YOU GO.
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT APPLE
AND A NEWS AND APPLE PICKING OUT
WHEN HIS IS RIGHT FOR YOU BASED
ON OTHER THINGS THAT YOU ARE
INTERESTED IN WHICH TELLS ME YOU
THAT'S ONE THING YOU ARE
INTERESTED IN.
>> I WILL TELL YOU, ONE OF THE
MOST LIBERAL PORTIONS OF AMERICA
IS SOMEHOW TRYING TO DICTATE
WHAT THE REST OF AMERICA CAN
CONSUME AND WHO CAN BE THE
VOICE.
IT WORRIES ME THAT POSSIBLY
THREE OR FOUR EXECUTIVES HAVE
ENOUGH CONTROL TO CONTROL
EXACTLY WHAT YOU READ IT, WHAT
YOU LISTEN TO AND WHAT YOU SEE
AND I THINK THAT CAN HAVE A
BIASED OPINION ON PEOPLE.
BUT WE NEED TO DO IS HAVE AN
OPEN AREA, AND I THINK A FREEDOM
WHERE YOU CAN CONSUME ALL TYPES
OF CONTENT.
I BELIEVE THAT MOST PEOPLE IN
AMERICA, THEY SEE BOTH SIDES AND
MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
>> I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO BE
AWARE OF THE MESSAGES BEING SENT
TO YOU ON YOUR PHONE AND
EVERYWHERE ELSE, YOU NEED TO
UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF YOU
THEM ARE BEING SENT TO YOU
INTENTIONALLY.
I TALKED ABOUT MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN, HIS PROMISES KEPT
THE SLOGAN?
>> WELL PROMISES KEPT RIGHT NOW
IS A SUB SLOGAN AND WHAT THAT
MEANS IS HE MADE PROMISES AND IS
KEEPING THEM.
YOU CAN LOG ONTO THIS WEBSITE,
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT EACH AND
EVERY PROMISE HE IS MADE, WHICH
IS HUNDREDS OF THEM.
MORE THAN -- PROMISES KEPT THAN
PROBABLY ANY PRESIDENT IN
HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.
>> YOU THINK DENNIS RODMAN IS A
GOOD PERSON TO REPRESENT AMERICA
IN THE NORTH KOREA SUMMIT?
>> HE WAS A GOOD REBOUNDER FOR
