Since the news broke of
Michael Cohen’s guilty plea,
we’ve been getting a
ton of legal questions
from our readers,
and I’m going to try
to answer some of them.
On the one hand,
impeachment is a
political process.
But if everything
Michael Cohen says
is true — that the
president instructed him
to violate
campaign finance laws
by paying
hush money to women
who said they had
affairs with him
in order to influence
the election —
that is just the
sort of thing
the framers of
the Constitution
were concerned about.
And they thought
that interfering
with the integrity
of elections
could well be an
impeachable offense.
Which leads us to our next
question that some of you
were wondering about:
In general,
for impeachment purposes,
most scholars say that
only the actions of a sitting
president should matter —
that criminal misconduct
before a president
took office should not
be grounds for impeachment.
But they make one
exception:
Did the conduct
cause the president
to obtain his office
illicitly and corruptly?
And that’s what the Cohen
allegations seem to add up to.
And one question we
got via Twitter was:
I think they’re basically
surface similarities
because President Clinton’s
conduct — however ugly
and questionable —
was private conduct.
In the Trump case,
if the Michael Cohen
allegations are correct,
you may well have
him corruptly
obtaining his office.
And that’s much more closely
tied to the presidency
than what was said
about Bill Clinton.
Lastly, one person
asked if
Cohen could be pardoned.
The president can pardon
Michael Cohen if he wishes to.
Were he to pardon somebody
who poses a threat to him,
in a criminal proceeding,
that would be the use
of the president’s office
not to offer clemency
based on neutral grounds —
but on self-interested
grounds.
And that, too, could
raise the prospect 
of impeachment.
