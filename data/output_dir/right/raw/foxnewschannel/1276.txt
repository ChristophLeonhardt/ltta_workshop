BEING ABUSED.

36
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:00,024
THEY HAD GOTTEN SPECIAL

THEY TOOK THIS CLAIM THEY

41
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,503
RAN WITH IT.

42
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:13,337
THEY MADE CLAIMS THAT WERE

43
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:13,938
NOT TRUE.

44
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:15,639
DURING THAT WHOLE TIME, THEY

45
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,375
WERE AWARE THAT PEOPLE WERE

00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,175
ABUSING THE DRUG.

47
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:22,613
THEY HAD REPORTS FROM THEIR

49
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:23,881
THEY HAD REPORTS FROM LAW

ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

51
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:26,150
AND THEY SAT ON THESE

52
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,251
REPORTS.

53
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,552
THEY MADE MADE NO MENTION OF

00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:32,456
AUTHORITIES, TO LAWMAKERS.

56
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:33,891

>> Tucker: SO, LOOKING BACK,

59
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:38,462
I MEAN, THIS DRUG WAS

60
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:40,631
SHIPPED TO SOME COUNTIES

61
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,532

WEST VIRGINIA IN QUANTITIES

63
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:43,734

00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:47,705
CAN IMAGINE.

67
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:48,839
IT MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS

68
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:49,807
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

69
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:50,841
THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN.

70
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,610
WHY HAS NO ONE BEEN CHARGED

71
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,411
FROM THIS COMPANY?

72
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:56,914

INVESTIGATED THIS COMPANY

75
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,450
WANT YOU HAD TO CHARGE THEM.

76
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,352
THEY WANTED TO BRING VERY

77
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,421
SERIOUS CHARGES AGAINST THE

78
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:03,821
EXECUTIVES.

79
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,389
OUR REPORT AND THE MATERIAL

80
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,425
THAT IS IN PAIN KILLER IS

81
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:10,728

WITH SERIOUS FELONIES THAT

87
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:19,703
WOULD HAVE SENT THEM TO

88
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:20,037
PRISON.

89
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:22,440
BUT THEY GOT STOPPED BY TOP

90

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS

91
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,809

UNBELIEVABLE.

102

>> IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

103
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:39,757
>> Tucker: DO YOU THINK WE

104
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:40,858
PASSED A POINT WHERE IT

105
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:42,259
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO

106
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,727
CHARGE THE PEOPLE PARTLY

114
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:52,803
IT'S PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

115
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:53,471
BRING CRIMINAL CHARGES.

116
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,772
THERE ARE A LOT OF CITIES

117
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:57,007
AND STATES THAT ARE BRINGING

118
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,642

I MEAN, I THINK THE

122
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,548
IMPORTANT THING IS THIS:  WE

123
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:05,850
ARE NOW IN THE MIDST.

124

THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF

128
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,691
IT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT

129
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,024
STARTED.

130
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,693
HOW DOES A STORY THAT PAIN

00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,862
KILLER TELLS.

THAT STORY.

134
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:21,999
WE NEED TO KNOW WHO NEEDS TO
