one of the most challenging stories we ever filmed was called swimming in syrup the myth is that you can swim just as fast in syrup as in water because even though the thicker material slows you down it gives you more to push off of and those two forces cancel each other out they looks fast but those resounding flops tell a different story it's both very expensive to fill pools full of jelly and also very weird to fill them full of different viscosities of jelly to try and test a wide range of viscosities to test the story and that was a story in which we filmed for eight days and every single day the results we got completely surprised us and so every day we had to figure out what we were gonna do the next day which was different than we thought and we both swam significantly slower in syrup it's not looking good for the myth I know but I'm not willing to let this one go I'm starting to believe that we might have gotten this whole viscosity thing all wrong I mean that story kept on changing direction and kept on changing direction a lot of times there are shows that try to capitalize on Mythbusters success and what I can smell when I watch those is a producer writing down everything that's supposed to happen and then filming that and on Mythbusters we don't know what's going to happen and when something happens we didn't expect we change direction and we follow our noses towards that conclusion and we've been doing that for 12 years
