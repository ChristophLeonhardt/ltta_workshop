a rally speech better designed for a shrinks coughs in a public setting Donald Trump aired grievance after grievance after grievance amid an obvious grab for the spotlight that for much of the day yesterday was owned by his disgrace EPA Administrator got through it Pruitt resigning amid a sea of ethical scandals and withering criticism from across the ideological spectrum trunk the one close friend and outside advisor once described is the Sun King because he wants all of the media's attention for himself lashed out at the press at John McCain at George HW Bush the FBI Democrats and the me - movement Democrats want anarchy they really do we call them the Democrat Party you know why the Democratic Party sounds too good yes she is a low IQ individual Maxine Waters I said it the other day hi I mean honestly she's somewhere in the mid 60's I believe that let's say I'm debating Pocahontas right I'm gonna get one of those little kids and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims a geez of Indian heritage because her mother said she has high cheekbones we will take that little kit and say but we have to do it gently because we're in the me two generations who have to be very gentle and we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity paid for by Trump if you take the test that it shows you're an idiot how about that FBI agents how about that guy you think he likes me or did we catch them in the act it's a rigged deal folks it's a rigged deal I used to say it it's a rigged deal to disgrace 75% of those people are down right dishonest downright - sighs they're fake they're fakes oh yeah where's Milania but Trump saved a warm fuzzy for you guessed it Vladimir Putin they're going well president Trump be prepared you know President Putin is KGB and this is them you know what Putin's fine he's fine we're all fine with people will I be prepared totally prepared I've been preparing for this stuff my whole life they don't say that we are all people you get that trucks warm were through his authoritarian counterpart come his White House aides confirm that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will meet one-on-one with no one other than translators in the room New York Times writing quote there's no telling what mr. Trump a president who abhors long briefing papers and often disregards or defies the advice of his advisors will choose to say while he is alone with mr. Putin a prospect that puts some of his aides and experienced diplomats inside and outside the government on edge here to help us understand the ties that seemed to bind Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin some of our favorite reporters and friends Peter Nicolas White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal Kimberly Atkins chief Washington reporter for the Boston Herald Frank fig Lizzy former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence and with us at the table Jonathan Lemire Associated Press White House reporter and Evan McMullen former CIA operative and former candidate for president is an independent the rally even his friends described that version of Donald Trump as slightly pathetic as someone who is so desperate for attention so desperate for the cheers and and hoots and hollers from the crowd that he puts on a show that really isn't even remotely close to anything presidential yeah there's a show on Comedy Central's where a guy basically makes the entire show out of impersonating the President and almost sound like Donald Trump who's doing that impersonation of himself right rather than being him he was so over the top right and I've covered between the campaign and since taking office dozens upon dozens a hundred of these rallies and I'm surprised at my ability to still be surprised but I was by the me to movement there with Elizabeth Warren that he'd were two tips to try to make a joke about something that is obviously you know been a groundswell in the last year or so for a lot of people has meant a lot of people women have come for with their stories we're in such a recall but this is a president who himself has been accused of sexual assault repeatedly who we heard on and the Access Hollywood tape bragged about doing so who just yesterday the day of this rally he made the higher official of bill shine for who now his new communications director who previously was at Fox News being drummed out for covering up these exact kind of escapades of sexual harass and last night that was the most perhaps stunning moment but they were there were circles I saw some polling today that even among women Republican Women his approval number is 20 points lower than his approval rating among Republican men I think it's 54 percent approval either among men or among Republican many is about a 34 percent approval among women so that plays right into this opportunity to steal women from the the independent and Republican categories in the midterms that has to make people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell very nervous of course women's suburban women in particular that mean that's not a hand the Republican Party wants to be dealt going into this this fall's midterms and you would think that Donald Trump though he you know had success to a degree in 2016 with that with Republican Women that he would not want to like lose any of they can't afford to hemorrhage any of that support going into his reelection bid so that mean that was the most dramatic moment but also let's recall we're just days after a newspaper was shot up in Annapolis Maryland a number of people died and we took Donald Trump 24 hours to sort of express his sympathies to the news personally express his sympathies for the victims and to defend those sort of rights the Free Press and here we are just days later he's back on his usual fake news attacks I'm Kimberly Atkins our viewers can't see you but I can see you nodding let me just let you weigh in on any and all of that now I think that Jonathan is spot on look we have the president who also is at a place he's about to appoint his second Supreme Court justice in his first term that something that few presidents get to do he's about to go to NATO and represent the United States there there are a lot of things for him to be talking about but you can see he is at his most comfortable place at these rallies doing what he thinks that crowd wants which is a tax on Elizabeth Warren which includes not only a joke about the me2 movement but also his favorite racial slur to hurl at her and just a lot of ginning up the crowd it seems that when he is in these rooms with his core supporters they bring out the worst in each other he resorts to that sort of talk and they shout lock her up but that's what he likes to do that's what he's going to focus on and we're gonna see a whole lot more than that leading up to the midterms and certainly into 2020 I'm Peter let me quickly I'm just to pass along something I heard from a trump ally this morning he said for a president so publicly and privately obsessed with the size of things crowds hands whatnot he never misses an opportunity to showcase his smallness well I you have to look at these rallies in some sense as a dramatic acting out of his tweets where the president is just that's great yeah I think what we're seeing is a kind of a dramatic expression of tweets where he's Unchained these are spontaneous and and they keep the audience riveted they keep the news media riveted I mean he may make news at any minute and he often does and I think that that is really a measure for him a criteria to Jonathan's point I wonder how much calculation is going into when he's out these rallies how much calculating he's doing about like which which constituency he's winning or losing as opposed to is the audience engaged are they entertained I mean is immediate and thorough Auld so I think those are the criteria he considers Frank Busey lest we not get lost in the lunacy and the smallness of it all he did single out Vladimir Putin for praise and this is a president heading into a consequential summit next week a president who does not get briefed people don't tell him the Russia in intelligence developments we know that doesn't like to hear that we've also learned that he doesn't read the PDB so I think it's fair to assume that he doesn't listen to a briefing on Russia any doesn't read a briefing on Russia unless he's reading Braille he's not hearing anything about Russia what do you make of the fact that for all that lunacy he singled out Vladimir Putin for praised said we're all people so all the things that he said last night that were disturbing and that we could focus on that phrase that comment about Putin being KGB but he's one us he's okay we're all people that is what I choose to focus on because that's the most disturbing and I have to tell you Nicole an attempt to normalize a stone-cold killer like Vladimir Putin who orders the murders and poisonings of those who he disagrees with is extremely troubling and this president is about to sit across a table from this man alone and discuss national security matters and and so what what troubles me the most here is that we're watching our president become unhinged imploding in full view of the world and now negotiating with killers negotiating with heads of state who he perhaps should not be sitting down and negotiating with and that leads me to the conclusion Nicole that perhaps the greatest threat facing our national security today is an insider threat it's the President himself who doesn't get it doesn't understand what he's up against you great that Evan I do agree with that and I might even go further than Frank is gone although I think everything that said that Frank said was correct but look he the president is a national security threat I and Frank we're not the first ones to observe this this person this man this president has has a dangerous relationship with one of our primary foreign adversaries an adversary that is attacking our country specifically attacking our ability to choose to select our own leaders the president when he does these things and I would say the whole theme last night is not just a president who's coming unhinged this is a president who's trying to desensitize us and normalize us to attacks on our democracy to attacks on the institutions that protect our Liberty whether it's the press whether it's the FBI he does these things not just because he's going crazy does these things because he wants to walk his people and the country down this road of this road away from from from liberal democracy or away from open free society that's what he's doing and so even when he attacks the me2 movement that's part of it we might say normal normal political leaders might say well don't go in we're near that right that's dangerous to you no no that's not that's not Donald Trump's approach Donald Trump's approach is to attack it head-on trivialize it and make it a non-issue he's done that with Russia he's done that with the me2 movement he's done that with the FBI and he'll do that more and more again we think he's being unhinged we think it sounds crazy but there's a reason he's doing it and as you could hear from the applause in that room it's somewhat effective hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to
