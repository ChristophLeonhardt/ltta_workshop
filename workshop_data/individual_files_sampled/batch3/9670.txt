JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK OF SAMANTHA BEE'S HATEFUL COMMENTS? TAKE A LOOK AT "STREET JUSTICE." SAMANTHA BEE CALLS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER IVANKA A FECKLESS C WORD. WHICH MOST OF PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EVEN SAID. BUT SHE STILL HAS HER SHOW. SHOULD SHE BE ABLE TO KEEP HER SHOW? I DON'T THINK SHE'LL GET MUCH SUPPORT FOR USING LANGUAGE LIKE THAT. I KNOW I WOULDN'T WATCH IT. JUDGE JEANINE: IF THAT WERE SAID AGAINST A DEMOCRAT'S DAUGHTER. THE WORLD WOULD BE UPROAR. JUDGE JEANINE: AND SHE WOULD LOSE HER SHOW? ABSOLUTELY. JUDGE JEANINE: ROSEANNE BARR LOST HER SHOW, WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO SAMANTHA BEE? I THINK SHE BETTER BE PREPARED FOR PEOPLE TO NOT PAY ATTENTION. SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT SHE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THE SAME WAY ROSEANNE HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHOULD BE HELD IT WAS PERSONAL. IT WASN'T RACIAL. JENNA: IT WAS WOMAN HATING. BUT A WOMAN SAID IT. JUDGE JEANINE: IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAY THEY TREAT LIBERALS AND THE WAY THEY TREAT REPUBLICANS. THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD ACROSS THE BOARD. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HYPOCRITIC. JUDGE JEANINE: SAMANTHA BEE SAYS SOMETHING TERRIBLE ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER, SHE CALLS HER A FECKLESS C WORD. SHE SHOULD BE FIRED. JUDGE JEANINE: SHE IS NOT BEING FIRED. WHY NOT? FAIR IS FAIR. IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO SAY THESE THINGS ON TELEVISION IN PUBLIC. YOU SHOULD KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF AND NOT SUCH A BIG AUDIENCE. JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT SHOULD
