FIRST, MEET THE CHAIRMAN, THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S "ANGLE." Laura: AHAD A HORRIBLE DREAM LAST NIGHT, WAKE UP IN A COLD SWEAT. THE CALENDAR READ WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 7 AND THE DEMOCRATS HAD GAINED CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. AND THE FIRST HORRIBLE VISION I HAD, BLURRY, IT WAS MAXINE WATERS, TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. IT WAS HEARTBREAKING, BUT I THINK WOMEN ARE NOT GOING TO RECEDE, WOMEN ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CONFRONT WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THAT CONFIRMATION. AND HIM. AND HE WON'T REST EASY IN HIS JOB. Laura: OH, OH, OH, WHAT WAS ON TO YOU, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, HE WON'T REST EASY? SOUNDS LIKE AN IMPLICIT THREAT. OR DOES SHE MEAN IMPEACHMENT? THE JUSTICE IS GOING TO BE CONFRONTED IN HIS HOME AND PUBLIC LIFE, PUBLIC PLACES? IS IT SOME KIND OF DOG WHISTLE TO GO AFTER KAVANAUGH? SIMILAR TO HER EARLIER CALL TO HARASS CONSERVATIVES EARLIER THIS YEAR? WELL, SOON, SHE MAY BE HARASSING ALL OF AMERICA. IF THE DEMOCRATS REST CONTROL OF THE WREST CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AUNTIE EM WOULD BE THE FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD THE HOUSE SERVICES COMMITTEE. SHE FACED THREE ETHICS VIOLATIONS FOR SETTING UP A MEETING BETWEEN TREASURY OFFICIALS AND A GANK HER HUSBAND SAT ON THE BOARD OF. SHE THINKS SHE'S TEFLON. SHE KEEPS ON MAKING THREATS. I'M GOING TO KEEP SAYING THAT WE NEED TO IMPEACH HIM. JOIN WITH ME, LET'S IMPEACH 45! IF HE THINKS HE CAN STOP ME, FROM TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHING 45, HE HAS ANOTHER THOUGHT COMING. IMPEACH 45! Laura: IN A'S MY RING TONE BY THE WAY. I ALWAYS WANT TO AVOID IT. AND THIS IS ANOTHER MAN WHO SHARES MAXINE'S IMPEACHMENT FANTASY. IF THE DEMOCRATS SWEEP TO POWER, JERRY NADLER WOULD BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SHARMNING HIS LIFE FORK AND KNIFE FOR KAVANAUGH. WE WOULD HAVE TO INVESTIGATE ANY CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS OF PERJURY AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PROPERLY LOOKED INTO BEFORE. IF HE IS ON THE SUPREME COURT, AND THE SENATE HASN'T INVESTIGATED, THEN THE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO. Laura: NOW, WITH ALL THAT'S FACING AMERICA, ALL OF THE POTENTIAL, DO WE WANT A PROLONGED INQUISITION OF A SITTING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE? THE LAST AND ONLY TIME A HOUSE IMPEACHED A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, 1804. SO, READY FOR KAVANAUGH'S CIRCUS PART 3? OR UNLESS SENATOR SPARTACUS BECOMES A LION TAMER I'M GOING TO PASS. MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSMAN RICHIE NEIL. HE'S POISED TO BECOME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE. IF THAT HAPPENS, FORGET THE IDEA OF MAKING THOSE TRUMP MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS PERMANENT. NEIL WAS A FIERCE OPPONENT OF THE TRUMP TAX PACKAGE AND IS EXPECTED TO TRY TO ROLL BACK SOME OF THOSE TAX CUTS. THERE GOES OUR ECONOMIC BOON. THEN THERE'S MARYLAND'S ELIJAH CUMMINGS. HE'S IN LINE TO BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMIT. HIS MISSION, TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 7 WAYS TO SUNDAY. I WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE, AIDED AND ABETTED, BY THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, TO TEAR DOWN THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. Laura: THAT'S ALL. CUMMINGS IS ALREADY ON RECORD AS SAYING HE'D LIKE TO PROBE TRUMP'S CANCELLATION OF SECURITY CLEARANCES, THE 2020 CENSUS, THE RIGHTS OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, AND THE PRESIDENT'S TREATMENT OF THE PRESS. NOW, THIS FRIVOLOUS PARTISAN INVESTIGATIONS WOULD COST MILLIONS AND ACHIEVE ZIPPO. THEY WOULD SERVE THE DEMOCRATS' GOAL OF PARALYZING THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION IN A BLIZZARD OF PROBES AND INQUIRIYIES. MY FRIENDS IT WON'T END THERE. IF PETER DEFAZIO BECOMES THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN HE'S MANNING TO DO OVERSIGHT OF THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL AND THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT GAVE TRUMP A LEASE FOR THE OLD POINT OFFICE BUILDING IN D.C. WHERE THE HOTEL IS. AND IF MONEY IS POWER, CONGRESSWOMAN NITA LOWEY IS ABOUT TO BECOME THE QUEEN OF THE HOUSE. SHE COULD HEADED POWERFUL APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IN CHARGE OF SPENDING YOUR MONEY. LOWEY HAS NEVER MET A LIBERAL SOCIAL PROGRAM SHE DIDN'T LIKE. THE 81-YEAR-OLD DEMOCRAT WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO SHIFT OUR SPENDING PRIORITIES FROM THINGS LIKE DEFENSE, BORDER SECURITY, TO WELFARE AND ARTS PROGRAMS. THAT WILL KEEP THE ECONOMY HUMMING. AND THE WALL, IT'LL NEVER BE FUNDED. THE LEFT IS SALIVATING OVER THE POSSIBILITIES IN A LIBERAL HOUSE TAKEOVER. ADAM SCHIFF COULD RESTART THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. ELIJAH CUMMINGS WILL HAVE SUBPOENA POWER AT OVERSIGHT. MAXINE WATERS WILL BE THE HEAD OF THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL REGULATION. THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. IT'S GOING TO BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE OUTRAGES. Laura: THE MSNBC CROWD, IT'S CHRISTMAS MORNING. FOR AMERICA, IT WOULD BE THE NIGHTMARE WE CANNOT ALLOW TO BECOME A REALITY. IF THIS BAND OF LIBERAL MISFITS AND RADICALS TAKES THE REINS OF THE POWER IN NOVEMBER, IT WILL BE SCARIER THAN HALLOWEEN, ONLY THE TRICK IS ON THE AMERICAN
