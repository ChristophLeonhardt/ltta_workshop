Kathmandu, Nepal
Thousands gather to glimpse Nepal’s living
child goddess, the Royal Kumari.
Nepali people worship Kumari and believe she
is a reincarnation of the Hindu goddess Durga.
Selected as a child, she lives a secluded
life in the Kumari Ghar, and her feet cannot
touch the ground.
Once the current Kumari reaches puberty, a
new goddess is chosen through a series of
secret rituals.
Activists have criticized the custom, calling
it a form of child abuse.
But in 2008, Nepal’s Supreme Court upheld
Kumari worship due to its cultural significance.
