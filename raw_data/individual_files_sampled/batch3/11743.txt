the American musician and DJ Moby claims he's been doing some behind-the-scenes stirring against Donald Trump he said in a recent interview that friends and contacts within the CIA did ask him to promote certain ideas online including the alleged collusion between the US president and Russia Jacqueline Berger has the story it's no surprise that someone like moby has friends and rather high places but what he claims they've asked him to do is unexpected and more than a little worrying according to the music icon his inner circle includes current and former CIA agents who apparently asked him to use his popularity to spread anti Trump theories I've managed to make a few friends in the intelligence community so they passed on some information to me and they said like look you have a big you have more of a social media following than any of us do can you please post some of these things just in a way sort of put it out there and he did just that in a lengthy Instagram post accusing Trump of being a foreign puppet and claiming that US intelligence agencies were trying to get rid of Trump perhaps easy to brush off it's no secret that Moby isn't a fan of Trump and there's no way to confirm if CIA staff really did make that request but at the same time would that really be so far-fetched in all actuality US intelligence and military organizations have long had close relationships with celebrities and Hollywood in the mid-80s post-vietnam u.s. Americans were fed up with war and public confidence in the military was declining enter Top Gun and will be glorifying a macho Navy fighter pilot dangerous that was made in collaboration with the Pentagon and it triggered a spike in people signing up to the military the army even set up recruitment tables at theaters showing the movie a more recent example zero dark thirty depicting the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden you really believe this story Osama bin Laden her confidence declassified documents show that changes were made to the script at the CIA's request to show the agency in a better light scenes showing torture used as an interrogation technique where a particular sticking point and a scene was cut showing a dog being used to threaten a detainee the CIA said they wouldn't use methods like that but many will remember that the US war on terror isn't above using such techniques Hollywood carries a lot of weight when it comes to public opinion something that's not lost on those in Washington it's not their job no it's not even it's not necessary and it's not appropriate in fact if if directors of the CIA were to discover such type of outreach and behavior unless it's at their direction they should be fired whoever's doing it should be fired their jobs not to reach out to Hollywood liberals to try to undermine in a gross display of insubordination their boss the President of the United States whether it's Barack Obama or now President Donald Trump it's insubordination it's theft I don't think it's espionage unless they're leaking classified data for that purpose but it certainly undermines their role
