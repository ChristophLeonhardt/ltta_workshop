00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:11,613
AINSLEY: COMEDIAN MICHELLE

2
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:12,213
WOLF DOUBLING DOWN ON

3
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,448
INSULTING JE'KELS AT THE

4
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,016
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS

5
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:15,350
DINNER.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,118
>> HONESTLY I WENT CHANGE A

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,153
SINGLE WORD THAT I SAID.

8
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:19,988
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT I

9
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:20,288
SAID.

10
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:25,460
AND I'M GLAD I STUCK TO MY

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:25,827
GUNS.

12
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:26,461
AINSLEY: WHO IS MITCHELL

13
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,997
WOLF AND WHY DIDN'T THE

14
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:32,834
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS

15
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:33,868
ASSOCIATION KNOW WHAT SHE

16
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,437
WAS GOING TO SAY.

17
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:36,371
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY IS A FOX

18
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,506
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

19
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,074
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

20
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:40,408
>> GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

21
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:41,176
AINSLEY: SHE SAID I'M GLAD I

22
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:43,311
STUCK TO MY GUNS LIKE SHE IS

23
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:44,612
A MARTYR.

24
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:45,580
>> MICHELLE WOLF THIS WORKED

25
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,448
OUT WELL FOR HER.

26
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:47,382
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE KNEW

27
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,550
WHO SHE WAS BEFORE AND NOW

28
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,285
SHE IS MUCH MORE OF A COMMON

29
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:50,852
NAME.

30
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:51,853
IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT

31
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:53,288
WHETHER SHE SHOULD

32
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:53,655
APOLOGIZE.

33
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:54,422
THIS IS WHO SHE IS.

34
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:55,657
THIS IS WHO SHE HAS BEEN.

35
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,392
I HAVE SEEN HER DO STANDUP

36
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:58,960
BEFORE WHEN SHE OPENED UP

37
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,161
FOR LOUIE C.K.

38
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,730
I WAS NOT SURPRISED BY WHAT

39
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,331
SHE DID ON THE DASE THERE.

40
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,534
SHE IS A WRITER FOR THE

41
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,003
DAILY SHOW.

42
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:09,571
UNEVEN POLITICAL COMMENTARY

43
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:10,672
ATTACKING REPUBLICANS AND

44
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:11,673
CONSERVATIVES AND PROTECTING

45
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,308
LIBERALS FOR A DECADE OR

46
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:13,608
MORE.

47
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,510
SO THIS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT

48
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,077
MICHELLE WOLF.

49
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,912
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE

50
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:18,580
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS

51
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,848
ASSOCIATION AND WHY THEY

52
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,149
THOUGHT MICHELLE WOLF WOULD

53
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,283
BE A GOOD PERSON TO HAVE AT

54
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,252
THE EVENT KNOWING HER

55
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:24,753
HISTORY.

56
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:25,587
AINSLEY: MAYBE THEY KNEW

57
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:26,588
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE

58
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:26,921
GETTING.

59
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:27,989
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE

60
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,424
SOUND BITES SHE WAS A

61
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,558
COMEDIAN ON THE DAILY SHOW?

62
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,660
>> BEFORE YOU PUT TOO MUCH

63
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,962
HOPE IN IVANKA, REMEMBER,

64
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,864
SHE BROUGHT A BRAND OF

65
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:37,365
FESTIVAL THAT MAKES HER RICH

66
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,299
BY EXPLOITING THE VERY

67
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,401
PEOPLE SHE IS CLAIMING TO

68
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:39,701
HEM.

69
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,036
THAT'S NOT BEING A FEMINIST.

70
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,438
THAT'S BEING A TRUMP.

71
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,340
DONALD J. TRUMP YOU JUST

72
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,409
BECAME AMERICA'S BUTLER.

73
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,111
NOW, GO FIX OUR HEALTHCARE.

74
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,414
MAKE SHE A SANDWICH YOU

75
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:52,747
[BLEEP]

76
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,681
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

77
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,416
BACK STORY IS?

78
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,784
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

79
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:57,652
AND THE FOLKS THAT WORK FOR

80
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:58,920
THE DINNER ITSELF AND

81
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,655
ORGANIZE IT, DO YOU THINK

82
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,023
THEY KNEW WHO SHE WAS AND

83
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:03,658
WHAT THEY WERE GETTING?

84
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,126
>> THOSE CLIPS ARE A GOOD

85
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,361
REMINDER THAT THE BIG CRIME

86
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,495
FOR MICHELLE WOLF REALLY

87
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,030
THAT SHE WASN'T FUNNY AT AN

88
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,899
EVENT WHERE THAT WAS HER ONE

89
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:11,933
JOB TO BE FUNNY.

90
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,468
THIS IS, AGAIN, THIS IS

91
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:14,502
â™ª JUST MICHELLE WOLF.

92
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,637
THIS IS A PATTERN GOING BACK

93
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:16,638
MANY YEARS.

94
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:17,105
THE WHITE HOUSE

95
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:17,906
CORRESPONDENTS DINNER IS A

96
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:21,276
VERY RITZY, VERY BIG AFFAIR

97
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:22,744
WHERE ALL OF D.C.

98
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,379
JOURNALISTS GET TOGETHER AND

99
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,313
COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER ON

100
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,781
WHAT A GREAT JOB THEY ARE

101
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,450
DOING EVEN AFTER YEARS OF

102
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,018
DOING DEMONSTRABLY BAD WORK

103
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,219
SUCH AS MISSING THE ENTIRE

104
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,354
STORY OF THE 2016 ELECTION.

105
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,055
OR COMING UP WITH CONSPIRACY

106
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:35,290
THEORIES ABOUT RUSSIA AND

107
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,091
PUSHING THEM DESPITE

108
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:36,458
EVIDENCE.

109
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,492
THEN THEY GIVE AWARDS TO

110
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:38,893
EACH OTHER OVER THEIR BAD

111
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:39,160
JOB.

112
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,728
THIS IS A DINNER THAT'S

113
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:41,463
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED.

114
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,465
THEY LIKE TO SAY THIS DINNER

115
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:45,033
IS ABOUT GIVING SCHOLARSHIPS

116
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,367
WHEN REALLY ANYBODY WHO

117
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,535
OBSERVES IT SEES THIS IS A

118
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,037
DINNER WHERE THEY DO LIGHT

119
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,338
JOKES AGAINST DEMOCRATS SUCH

120
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,173
AS DURING THE ENTIRE EIGHT

121
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:52,674
YEARS OF THE OBAMA

122
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:53,475
ADMINISTRATION WHERE THE

123
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:56,478
COMEDIANS OR THE TALENT

124
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:58,012
WOULD JUST AFOOSBALLLY

125
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,115
PRAISE OBAMA OR GO AFTER

126
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,015
REPUBLICANS OR WHEN

127
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:01,816
REPUBLICAN IS PRESIDENT

128
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:03,051
GOING AFTER REPUBLICANS.

129
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:03,885
GOING AFTER CONSERVATIVES

130
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:05,153
AND REPUBLICANS HARD AND

131
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,521
PERSONALLY AND LIGHTLY

132
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,989
JABBING THEIR OWN PEOPLE THE

133
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,257
MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS IS JUST

134
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,058
WHAT THE CORRESPONDENTS

135
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,292
DINNER HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR.

136
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:15,330
IT IS -- IT'S A PERFECT

137
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,097
ENCAPSULATION OF WHAT THE

138
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:17,232
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE

139
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:17,799
MEDIA RIGHT NOW.

140
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,434
IT WAS A VERY HONEST DINNER

141
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,268
ABOUT THE STATE OF D.C.

142
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,269
RIGHT NOW.

143
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,003
AINSLEY: THIS IS WHY THE

144
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:23,438
PRESIDENT REFUSES TO GO.

145
00:03:23,438 --> 00:00:00,000
IS SHE AN ACTIVIST OR
