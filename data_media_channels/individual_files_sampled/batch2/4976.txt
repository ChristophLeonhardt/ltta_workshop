let's also bring in Marc Lauder he was a special assistant to president Trump and press secretary to vice president pence he is now the spokesman for the Trump pence political operation and a member of the Trump 2020 advisory board Marc thank you so much for being here what did the president tell Rand Paul that made him change his vote to a yes I think brand Paul heard what he needed to from Senator well from director Pompeo about to be Secretary of State that we are going to continue with the president's policies of putting America first but when it comes to fighting the war on terror when it comes to confronting the use of nuclear weapons or chemical weapons we are going to act strongly and we are going to continue to be the world leader in that and and I think also it sends a very strong signal that the Republicans will be united in the president's pick and if this is going to be a close vote it's going to be Democrats who are once again obstructing the president and sending that message to the world stage that they do not stand with him well you talk about obstruction the president has obviously said the Democrats are obstructing a lot we heard Sarah Huckabee Sanders say that a little bit earlier as well it's part of the narrative I can't you make the argument though that Democrats learned obstruction from Republicans who obstructed absolutely everything that President Obama tried to put through well let's remember that I mean senator senator Hillary Clinton was confirmed as Secretary of State with 94 votes John Kerry was confirmed with ninety four votes these were two presidential losers in the presidential races who Republicans did not share much in common with but when it came to the nation's foreign policy when it came to the national security they were all in favor and I think there were two votes and four votes against those two nominees so we've always put a politics aside when it comes to this and it's really it's disappointing that they cannot do that in this respect you know Republicans haven't put politics aside though when it comes to Supreme Court justice nominations which are arguably just as important they left that seat open for quite a while refusing to even have a hearing on Merrick garland so how do Republicans defend that well in the case I think Senator McConnell said it very well that since this was a rare vacancy that happened during an election year it was appropriate for the electorate to decide what kind of on the on the on the Supreme Court open that seems like it seems like you're trying to have your cake and eat it too by saying Democrats are obstructing it's completely not fair but it's totally okay for us to obstruct in this particular circumstance I mean an election year we've had election year nominees open up in the past or not not on the Supreme Court it's very rare when it's happened in the songs upon the United States Supreme Court which is a lifetime appointment not just an appointment that goes with a presidential with a presidential tenure so again this is something very different where do Democrats want to draw the line in terms of their resistance it's one thing if you're going to resist policy will have that argument during the midterms we'll have it again in 2020 but when it comes to the national security we have a long history of both parties coming together in a unifying theme whether it be when we are facing terror back in the early 2000s following 9/11 whether it was during the original Gulf War one when it was going back to some of the actions that President Reagan took there was still a lot of unit unanimity in terms of the partisanship standing behind our country and the message that we sent forward and it's just unfortunate they're not doing that 100% there used to be a lot more unanimity there used to be a lot less partisanship I totally agree with you on that but do you think the President himself has a lot of that blame to shoulder because of the way that he conducts himself because of the way he goes after the other party on Twitter people that don't agree with him even just on policy issues well he's gone after people from both part from both parties including his own party when it comes to certain policy issues and votes and that's and that's the way the president communicates but but again that's the way the president communicates you're talking about this lack of bipartisanship this lack of unanimity and the President himself is forcefully tearing apart the the the two parties keeping them apart and saying that you know if you're against me in any way if you disagree on my policy I'm gonna personally attack you is that it okay just to say that's the weak but let's also look it's it's I mean we've had opportunities look at the obstruction that's taking place in the Senate right now with many other nominees where they're putting up every roadblock every obstacle in some cases using all of the procedural hurdle and requiring 30 hours of debate to slow the wheels of government down only to confirm somebody with 90 plus votes in a non-controversial way that's the level of obstruction that we have seen from the beginning with this administration and that's one of the reasons why many cases we have vacancies that are still unfilled to this day when it comes to high levels of government office so what we need to be able to do especially when it comes to national security move forward quickly as we are confronting the issues with North Korea Russia the Iran deal we need our national security apparatus in full swing full operational function whether that includes a Secretary of State and a CIA director and I'm hoping that the Senate will do its job quickly put those two highly qualified individuals into office so we can move forward together I want to get you to interpret something for me the president has now shifted recently to go after robert muller and the Special Counsel investigation over the weekend he on Friday he tweeted this James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special counsel therefore the special counsel was established based on an illegal act really does everybody know what that means you were special assistant to Donald Trump what does that mean I think it means exactly what the president said it means is that if we have potentially illegal leaking of information which will be investigated and will be discovered as this process goes on declassify and he and he what number one he had the ability to declassify as FBI director and he redacted much of the information that would have been considered classified classified well that's something that the Inspector General and and many of the other committees are taking a look at right now and we'll see what their determination is but the basic the basis of the fire of the creating the Special Counsel was done based off of these off of these memos and so it's it's very questionable but let's get to the bottom line here is that late last week we heard reporting out of Bloomberg that says that Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein had informed the president last week that he is not a target of either the special prosecutor's investigation or the Michael Cohen investigation and I think that's a very big that's a very big headline that has not gotten a lot of attention so let's let these processes play out whether they were started under illegal or questionable practices in the beginning I think the White House continues to cooperate they continue to produce documents and interviews as requested and and everyone's confident as the president has said there was no collusion and this will wrap up finding some well everyone's not confident so far there hasn't been an assessment on that besides from the Republicans in the House committee and they said they just haven't seen any evidence of it they didn't say that they were confident there was no conclude no collusion so I want to correct you on that one other thing though if Congress did pass a law to protect robert muller do you think our bill to protect robert muller do you think the president should sign it I don't think there'll be a bill passed to do that well I'm not going to get into hypotheticals in terms of what the president may or may not sign but the White House including today has has reiterated time and time again that there are no discussions about firing the special counsel or the Deputy Attorney General and I think that's the reason why Senator McConnell and has said that there's really no reason for this bill and that it's not going to be brought to the floor of the United States Senate mark Lotter mark thank you so much
