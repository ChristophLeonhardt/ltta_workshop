the success of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what works is you have to</font>

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,750
have a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a good industry and</font>

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,670
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move as fast as hell</font>

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,500
before anybody else can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it</font>

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,880
let's get some of the best people and

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,740
let's pay them what they need to do give

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,230
them upside give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> some money and let</font>

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,300
them go with it it's not about the idea

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sound but it's really</font>

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,400
about execution we had a slight head

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,010
start in the beginning we had slightly

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,829
better technology and we had a better

14
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:43,780
management team and over time we were

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,250
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about developing a better</font>

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,780
management team which allowed us then to

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,360
move faster and it is course correcting

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,850
as you go if the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is not in</font>

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,469
fact perfect you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be willing to</font>

20
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,989
change it as a public company<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended</font>

21
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,980
up getting rid of our core business and

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,480
leaving us with our technology business

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,430
which ultimately became very valuable we

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,899
made the right decision but as you can

25
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,300
imagine it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brutal change to go to</font>

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,890
people who had built this over four

27
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,539
years it was doing four hundred million

28
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,700
dollars in revenue and get rid of it

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,319
this is someone who simply knows a

30
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,360
particular market very well obviously

31
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,490
does some initial research but then it

32
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">is right to the prototype stage and off</font>

33
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,780
you go from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone if a VC</font>

34
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,970
focuses a lot on the details of a

35
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,590
financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> model I don't work with them</font>

36
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,060
that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't really</font>

37
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,069
understand what they need to focus on is

38
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,649
is this a big enough market do we have a

39
00:01:32,649 --> 00:00:00,000
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and we have good people</font>
