1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,360
He was a warrior,
he was a prisoner,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,560
he was a hero,
he was a congressman,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,370
he was a senator,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,530
he was a nominee for president
of the United States.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,329
We gather here to
mourn the passing

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,340
of American greatness.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,070
The real thing,
not cheap rhetoric

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,580
from men who will never
come near the sacrifice

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,700
he gave so willingly.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,600
Nor the opportunistic
appropriation of those

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,910
who live lives 
of comfort and privilege,

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,500
while he suffered and served.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,900
The America of John McCain

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,700
has no need to be
made great again,

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,970
because America
was always great.

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,310
He was honorable,
always recognizing

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,760
that his opponents were still
patriots and human beings.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,970
He loved freedom with
the passion of a man who

19
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,260
knew its absence.

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,770
He respected the dignity
inherent in every life.

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,120
A dignity that does
not stop at borders

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,410
and cannot be
erased by dictators.

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,980
John believed in
honest argument

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,340
and hearing other views.

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,370
He understood that
if we get in the habit

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,630
of bending the truth
to suit political

27
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,900
expediency or party orthodoxy

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,960
our democracy will not work.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,840
That’s why he was willing to
buck his own party at times,

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,570
occasionally work across the aisle

31
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,690
on campaign finance reform 
and immigration reform.

32
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,220
That’s why he championed a
free and independent press

33
00:01:39,220 --> 00:00:00,000
as vital to our
democratic debate.
