in October 2017 the hashtag me to movement against sexual harassment and assault went viral and global silence for 20 years beginning with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein a string of powerful men were named Annie Carmen Harvey shamed and held to account over allegations of sexual offences sparking unprecedented debate on sexual harassment and violence and launching a global movement that's grabbed the attention of the power me too I have been sexually arrest today we are introducing the me to Congress act from me to he times up women and girls are calling out the boozy behavior my guest tonight is a feminist icon with a reputation for provocation never a stranger to controversy she emerged as one of me toos most prominent feminist critics and caused outrage with her controversial statements on rape so how should the issue of sexual assault be dealt with and this hashtag me to revolutionary or misguided I'm Mandi Hudson and I've come to the Oxford Union to go head-to-head with the writer thinker and legendary feminist Germaine Greer I'll ask her why she thinks the global me to movement against sexual harassment and assault has gone nowhere tonight I'll also be joined by Meena salami a feminist writer and speaker and the founder of the award-winning pan-african feminist blog miss afro Politan Laurie Penney an award-winning journalist author and feminist activist and Zoe simple a columnist author and historian of gender and relationship ladies and gentleman please put your hands together for Germaine Greer the author of the seminal feminist text the Female Eunuch she's been a renowned public intellectual and feminist provocateur since the 1970 Sherman Greer since the Harvey Weinstein scandal erupted late last year October 2017 the world has been swept by the hashtag me to campaign against sexual harassment assault violence rape feminists around the world now see me too as a major shift some say it's a game changer you however one of the biggest names in feminism have said it hasn't gone anywhere and that quote it will be extraordinary if it makes any difference at all why are you so down on it am i down on it it's just that if all it took was kicking ass and taking names and talking loud and drawing a crowd then we might have got somewhere already it's not enough to denounce the abuse of women I mean think about this the police the New York Police Department has brought a criminal prosecution against Harvey Weinstein on three counts one count of rape in the first degree another count of rape in the third degree and then another an account of a criminal act in which the woman who has complained of this is known to the public ie she's associated with me too now you may say who's the first woman well we don't know why don't we know because her anonymity is being protected by the court now this is kind of weird I've been against that forever I figure you want to put a man away for seven years show your face don't you don't be ashamed I want to get into the subject of rape and in enmity but before that just on the big picture because you did say it'll be extraordinary if it makes any difference at all that is pretty negative and pessimistic many would argue it's already made a lot of difference you look around World Congress is passing me to legislation the European Parliament is debating it the World Economic Forum in Davos put it on its agenda you have outside of the US TV presenters in Australia orchestra conductors in Switzerland politicians in South Korea the defense secretary here in the United Kingdom if people have either lost their jobs or been named and shamed or in certain cases prosecuted you can't say that's nothing can you I look at what's happening now that we now have women claiming sexual harassment sexual assault sexual this and that the first question to ask is what took you so long in most cases the statute of limitations has already passed and these people who are supposed to have performed these acts cannot be prosecuted this already became clear even in the case of Bill Cosby they could only find one case which had already been heard in a civil case to actually bring against him now but Bill Cosby was prosecuted in the end post to me to the first trial primi me to was a mistrial a hung jury post me - he was prosecuted I watched a lot of interviews of yours preparing for this I've read a lot of interviews what you do is you're very good at criticizing you're great at critique I don't hear the solutions let's say you do if you're saying the weinstein probably do want it are you saying that weinstein shouldn't have been prosecuted bill cosby shouldn't have been prosecuted because you're good at saying what's wrong with all these trials but a lot of people see them as victories for me too and for feminism they haven't been victories for anybody sexual assault continues abuse of women boy either you get rid of all sexual assault well you don't prosecute Bill Cosby it's a bizarre can wait a minute you're persecuting a man in his 80s who's been offending for 60 years what kind of a trial is that let's go to our panel Laurie penny who's a award-winning feminist writer author activist you've jumping up wanting to come in there it's only been six months patriarchy has been around for a very very very long time and I think there's kind of a as soon as women start doing something together suddenly it's like why haven't you changed the world it has been only just over six months I think there's a long there's a long game here but also you asked what took you so long right it is fair very legitimate fear of the social consequences of speaking up against rape and what has happened in the past few months this is we've seen this sea change where women and girls are suddenly able to come together and compare notes and support one another that's what's changed to me to respond to that I have spoken out about rape and about my own rape and I did it many many years ago when I was 19 years old I'm now 80 it's not true we haven't been hit that we've never been here before we have and we've got no way we've got nowhere because the laws upside-down the lawyers if you'll pardon the expression cock eyes the most important thing for it to do is defend the defendant against the malicious allegations of other people and there is a legal obligation to do that it meets it was never just about legal solutions though I mean I know about you yeah of course but look I don't need to have you know to have somebody convicted in a court of law of rape to say I don't want to invite that guy to my party I don't want to work with that guy on my project you know is it also about creating social consequences and creating new social norms and that is a big important thing that's changed as OE simple is a historian of gender and relationship she's a columnist for The Sunday Telegraph Jubilee what Laurie saying well I definitely see what Laurie's saying and I don't disagree but I just wanted to say that I think there's absolutely a place for Germaine to pour cold water on this movement that's you know if you're gonna be someone who sort of smiled upon by kind of polite society you must say it's just absolutely the best thing since sliced bread and Jermaine's job is to be a critic and I think she should absolutely be criticizing it I also think other kinds of threats that that a lot of women encounter frankly on the street at night and is me too actually reaching those perpetrators is me to helping those women who were kind of facing domestic violence all the time so I think I think I think Germaine is right to question the efficacy and Minister larmy is a feminist writer blogger founder of the award-winning pan-african blog this Afra politan when Jemaine talks about why did it take them so long and the whole anonymity issue where do you stand on that the point is not why it took so long or what a woman wore or what her sexual history is which is which are not claims you've been making but I'm just saying that it's a similar type of question we're always avoiding focusing on the actual crime and it's incredibly unfair to suggest that me too has not been tremendously impactful I mean me too is definitely one of the feminist Peaks and I think it's unprecedented in one way specifically which is that it is bringing home these conversations into our intimate spaces with me - unless you've been living under a rock you cannot avoid having these conversations with your partners with your father with our fathers with our uncle's sons etc and that is really unprecedented and as a as in really unprecedented I think it is you're talking about oh we need to concentrate on rape as a crime now most of the people in this country do not believe that non-consensual sex is rape they think it has to be violent wrong it doesn't they think that it is uncommon monstrous done by outsiders because in the court of law it is a crime except it isn't you will not not God consensual sex is that right hang on just a minute you will not find the millions of women who had non-consensual sex last night with their partners fronting up at the police station it never happens the longest struggle when it came to trying to rationalize the law of rape which is a mess was the one on whether it was possible to rape your own wife that was not decided in some American states until 1994 but the fact is it hasn't changed the law but that's why me - is so effective because I was baking a cake so I'm gonna ask again Germaine sorry if it's not effective what do you propose instead what is effective I would well there are many things that could be effective but we won't do them I mean we have teenage girls who have never had no Gazza who have no idea why they're even doing it because the pressure on them to have a partner is so great somehow we have got to rescue the institution of hetero sex from the mess it is in and that is partly brought about by pornography prostitution commercialization and the cheapening of everything about a woman's body but I'm guessing a lot of people here wouldn't disagree with you including some of our panelists but again I'm waiting for solution yes we need to do something well wait on dear boy I'm not sad it's easy to be a bomb thrower I'm asking for what me too you say it doesn't work it's not unprecedented I'm asking you a what's come before me two that was similar in your view and B what would you do instead it's two very simple questions we are in an unsafe situation we have unsafe convictions and we have other Marauders like Harvey Weinstein apparently able to operate with complete impunity not because he's who he is but because he's surrounded by people who were scared of him this is this is a very much bigger problem so here's what I do Harvey Weinstein the Marauder is now facing trials I'll react another one of my questions apologies do you support the prosecution of Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby it's regarded as two successes for me - well they're not successes yet one was found guilty and one is now being prosecuted for the first time despite having this for me of people but there'll be an appeal in the case of Cosby and you want it you want to have him in jail half blind in his 80s after 60 years of doing what he's been doing you're calling that a victory I think at least belongs there just seeing the guy have to face some sort of justice is a moral victory in itself I think you shouldn't discount that you know what this argument feels incoherent it really does I feel like in the 21st century we should be living in a sexual culture where we can get beyond let's not rape each other right let's not rape each other should be a baseline you know we can do better we can actually have some sort of understanding of pleasure desire and agency so you want to come if I have a question why don't we in terms of your questions about solutions is there not a need to think quite Prag medically and simply about well women lack physical confidence that women are considered themselves weak men can overpower them physically after all that is like where the rubber hits the road you know should girls be given martial arts training in school mandatory I mean or is that not as kind of suite of options we should be turning to first I mean you say martial arts to me let me pick up on the mark I mean you've invoked carry on comedies 1960's comedies you said whether people should slap down their that the man who kind of harasses them instantly on the spot and stand up for themselves which kind of feeds into what though as to what martial arts do you really think that's the kind of solution yes how would I have helped the women who were drugged by Bill Cosby how would that have helped Dylan Farrow who was 7 years old how would she have slapped down wouldn't have helped everybody but it would have helped the people who themselves were in that situation but like ordinary women on the street it helps that physical story but the this is not we carried out stranger rape is very rare most women who are who complain of sexual assault know who their attacker was and is a friend of this and is a part of this doesn't mean they have the ability to fend off an attacker I mean Harvey Weinstein the case you started with Harvey Weinstein they say it was pretty brutal with a lot of these women what are you supposed to do you're saying I'm just wondering what were they supposed to do look we're behaving as if Susan Brown Miller had never written her book on rape and there she argues that men used the threat of rape to keep us all in continual submission and that isn't true we are all made afraid of rape and God knows why because we're more likely to be mugged and raped but isn't it strange we're not afraid of being marked we're afraid of being raped and the chance to be I was raped by a stranger and the funny thing was that I I wasn't even annoyed with him I felt as if I'd stepped in the path of the bus I did I still don't know his name or else I'd suppress it and it was nasty you know it's beaten half-unconscious and i so that's about as bad as it gets but what I want him put away for seven years okay well this is this is where we get into territory where you've been getting in trouble with some evil remarks people think you're downplaying the crime of rape well yes you said recently the hay festival it shouldn't always be thought of as a violent crime but is quote bad sex which many would say is not just offensive but inaccurate Oh for Christ's sake non-consensual sex isn't always violent you can have non-consensual sex with a woman who's fast asleep without even waking her up what world do you people live in when I'm talking about bashing people up we're talking about really destructive six where a man climbs onto his partner because she's in the bed next to him I'm actually passionately opposed to double beds they're probably more responsible for bad sex than any other single piece of furniture I mean most of the sex we are having is bad and what is done by the rape is bad sex you stand by that comment it's non-consensual sex which is bad sex and it's not always violent no because many would argue that all rape is violent because it's a gross bodily violation of a woman well yes you can argue that if you want but you're pushing a point really violent well this is crisis England and Wales says they save penetrating another person's body without their consent is not an act of violence what is rape is an inherently violent crime regardless of whether external visible injuries sustained you better sit tell that to the traumatized women who turn up for their rape kit examination who are penetrated again and again where blood taken who have all kinds of liberties taken with them well let me I'm about it's not about Harvey Weinstein masturbating in front of you believe me that's completely no we're now well we're talking about rape which he's also accused of I mean not all rape is violent and it's bad sex okay sometimes violence does not just mean physically attacking someone violence is using force it's creating damage and you can create a lot of violent sexual damage when you force somebody to have sex with you I would hope that you agree with that further well you can but you know something of all the crimes in which injuries are sustained rape is the least impressive people get hurt all the time it's mad to pretend to a woman that a penis walking down the street is more dangerous than a knife yes in other words you cannot just decide what one woman experiences as a great violation of her of her body and and you've been speaking about you know reducing the sentences for rape by 50 suggested 200 hours of community service that wasn't me - you also said tattoo the letter R on their hand cheek why not a tattoo is alright at least it says don't go out with this book he's got form I need to clarify something you're saying you don't support reduced sentences ro because you've been quoted in plenty of interviews saying it should be the burden of proof should be lowered the Tara tribute to get more convictions why do you think juries can't convict why do they sit there listening to revolting stories and when it comes to the point they can't convict one of the reasons for that is the extremity of the sentences we've had them raised and raised and raised in the misbelief that the whip more women will complain and more juries will convict the effect is the opposite you think lowering it would get more convictions well you haven't got anywhere near enough prosecutions but that's fine of speculation giving it ever no lowering it would lead to more convictions admite it might making that big proposal based on nothing no I have many would argue that they're not convicting not because of terrorists but because I don't believe the woman and really we should be working on getting people to believe the woman well that's a problem because juries these days have women in them oh no woman has ever disbelieved another woman well who knows hang on a minute the really important thing to remember is that most rape if we're talking about what you keep saying misquoted so just hearing from the audience on TV do you support in the UK and the US shorter tariffs in prison maybe alternative to prison for rapists for convicted rapists it would depend they're not all the same you see the crimes are not all the same and the outcome is not all the same you say in one place I reduced sentence in another piece say depends but okay Laurie honestly it seems like this argument hasn't been thought through I think I see more coherence in some ways on Twitter the heart of your argument seems to be that the legal system as is inadequate to be dealing with the problem of the problem of rape and consent and I agree with you on that basis but the media movement has never been simply about the legal system the whole point is that you know then if the legal system has failed women there is a not just that binary between doing nothing and only ever believing the guy in assuming that the woman is lying and you know put the guy in a box forever so yeah sure I think we would all agree that sex is inherently full of gray areas because it's it there are no witnesses it's highly subjective and I think one of the problems with me too has been that it slumped a lot of things together and we've had sort of totemic ideas of men to women and then inevitably what happens it's like as Germaine said you get such a phallocentric image this like terrifying penises everywhere and then you get a sort of slightly victim narrative emerging for women so really just to sort of support the idea that that we need to have a system in place before it's sensitive to differences in just pick up on that point it's probably about to Jemaine I mean there's been this criticism of me to their use Zoe's lumps in too many different behaviors is that do you think that's a legitimate criticism people say well you know there's a difference between somebody groping you at work and somebody raping you a la Harvey Weinstein allegedly no because they're all part of the same conversation which is sexual harassment second rape sexual abuse toward women these are conversations that we haven't historically been able to have out in the open and I become so confused with your arguments because they're completely contradictory like you say that on the one end you have been pushing for women to come out with a first-person narrative and to name themselves and surely that is what is happening with me too I mean for the first time you have hundreds of thousands of women speaking about sexual abuse that they have experienced using their personal names Jemaine yes I agree and I agree that women should come out and take names and talk about and draw a crowd and ostracize the person who is behaving badly I mean I'm I've been teaching in universities all my life and I know who the sexual predators were on the universities I was in and there's many ways of abusing women they don't all involve the penis in fact the penis is the only part of a man I know what to do it frankly ok Jimmy but let me let me ask let me let me ask you this you say now you well what you say to me no look you welcome that's a good thing people come out and take names and yet just a couple of months ago you were on TV accusing me to of presenting women as victims you've you've said also for example if you spread your legs because he said be nice to me I'll give you a job in a movie that's tantamount to consent it's too late now to start whinging about that you think women are whinging an association to me - do you think they're presented as victims as you're quoted as saying there is a Maria Goretti aspect which is I was virtuous I fought him off and he punished me by not putting me in a movie and I'm thinking somebody stitched that together for me he is the executive director investor in the movie he put the hard word on you you said no you didn't get a part in the movie how can you prove that the two things are related and the fact is you can't this is it's what the world is about people are negotiating using sexuality and using vague threat and using promises that are fake you said to me know that you welcome people taking names you've said elsewhere that women are being presented as victims which is it are women being premieres presenting women as victims or as empowered strong women coming forward to call for justice which is it oh it well it's probably both and neither at the same time because we're not even if you spend as much time working on rape as I do you know that we're not even allowed to call complainants victims anymore we have to call them survivors as if being raped was like the wreck of the Titanic I'm a just fed up with the whole thing we'll have to leave it there we're going to take a break do join us for part two have head to head with Jermaine grey we're going to continue the conversation about feminism misogyny discrimination Jermaine's gonna be equally lively I'm sure and we've got a very patient audience here in the Oxford Union who are gonna put their questions to her so come back after the break welcome back to head-to-head my guest here at the Oxford Union is the legendary feminist writer intellectual author Germaine Greer Jemaine we were talking about some of your more provocative claims in part one just to continue in that vein in 2014 you wrote women persecute other women humiliate them and discriminate against them and that while they may not threaten to rape them quote women have more effective ways of doing other women in but you yourself some of your critics would say are pretty well known for humiliating other women you said on national television that the then Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard had a big ass and you said the nicest thing about Hillary Clinton is our rear end quote because it's big and fat and close to the ground I say that about Hillary Clinton you did you have no notion how big Hillary Clinton's assets not the fattest and I don't regard it as humiliating a big ass is a wondrous thing if you're the one who has trouble with the idea you think a must it's like it's some sort of like well you said I'm the one but Julia Gillard then Prime Minister of Australia said your comments reinforce stereotypes of women and that it frustrated her that you of all people would catapult into that kind of conduct you think it's right to judge female politicians of a much longer conversation about clothes and prime ministers female prime ministers well female country's amazes clothes male prime ministers tend to all wear the same thing and they all look the same in it do they get a pass from you no it's no point talking about it it's totally gonna pass effectively so you can talk about a prime minister's appearance clothes back suits and I think I'm allowed to say that if Theresa May would give us much thought to Brick's it as she gave to her necklaces you have to believe that out okay then we might get some way she must be carrying around this enormous case full of very heavy thing they look like the things that donkeys we're outside temples in India these big wooden things just do without them get on with the job here jump out a bit maybe be easier to get on with the job if feminists like yourself weren't focusing on her clothes appearance monkeys you've rightly pointed out the ageism and sexism in Western societies like the UK Australia us and of course across the world but you've suggested also that feminism has been quote infected by ageism as well why it's a very curious thing I spent 1970 traveling in India looking at how women live to see whether you could grow in authority and power and dignity as you got older as you cannot in our society even mrs. Thatcher got slung out like an old rag and left government in tears no man has ever had to do that then she had to go on the lecture trail while Tony Blair the great liar Blair is rolling because he's got so many directorships and seats on boards and so on and it's always got me that we mostly identify with young sexually active women and we don't think about what happens to older women I mean I went on good morning TV the other day and they were talking about you know misogyny and nastiness to women and I had to say try picking an old woman everybody treats you like an idiot and some younger feminists while agreeing with you on this point they would say the problem is that you are maybe out of touch with some of the struggles of younger feminists today in the feminist movement and they point specifically one of the most controversial issues as you know associated with you is your position on transgender women and trans rights and the idea of excluding these women from the modern feminist struggle used of being you've been accused of in transphobic because you said there are quote ghastly parody driven by misogynistic beliefs you've said they're not women how is that not exclusionary what am i exploding them from I don't understand I mean I'm I'm not a Jew I'm not an Aborigine I'd love to be one or other or both but I'm not that happens to me just the way people are organized or I don't I I don't find that's your position with your excuse somebody can say to me you are not a woman you're a cease woman I'm the real thing I'm very happy to believe that men make better women than women do because we know from that what it takes to turn you into a woman we used to call it conditioning nobody even mentions that anymore where you learn how to dress how to speak how to love pink and all the other things that make you a girly girl we had to learn all of those things and they are fake they are a masquerade you've been wit now we have to accept the masquerade as the thing that is more real than we are at this point as the author of email eunuch I can't do anything else but you except you are being exclusionary put aside the rights and wrongs of the issue am i excluding them from if they think they're women and you say they're not women by definition that is exclusion are you gonna question that definition as well I don't know what's the group that they're being excluded from but you stand by the position they're not women yes I do Laurie penny wants to come in well I think this distinction this idea that it is somehow offensive to draw it to say you know you are a sis woman people used to say that about you know about the words straight people used to say oh I'm not straight I don't want people to call me straight I'm just normal those people over there are weird I think what what the trans movement today is concerned about is making it clear there is a spectrum of gender experience and just because gender is a made-up construct and is that artifact of conditioning doesn't mean that it's not also a real thing that people suffer under that affects people's bodies you know most trans people are not living in this stereotype you you call them pantomime Dame that doesn't actually reflect reality most trans people do not live like that and it's stereotypical and offensive to suggest that they do Zoe do you want to come in here and you know does seem to be this incredibly strong reaction to the definition is this person a woman is this person not and Jermaine gets you know hugely pilloried or no platform or sticking to one definition which other people disagree so it's very interesting to are actually obsessed with the definition of woman I think I would also say you know I I just I really worry about the fact that those there's no platforming culture and I love this conversation now because what you're doing is what you're supposed to be doing which is engaging you know theoretically as feminists and you know I you can see the damage that that no platforming type of things did to the women's liberation movement 1970s it just shut everything down so you know on the issue itself the question I put to Jemaine about exclusion do you think she's guilty of excluding people from feminism from them absolutely when you say that there they are not women even though they are trans women and furthermore I've never read or heard or come across a trans woman saying I have the exact same experiences as this woman they're very aware of the fact that they have unique experiences as trans women just as I am aware as a woman of African heritage that there are certain experiences that I have had that none of you have had that is what trans women are saying so to dismiss that and to dismiss that they can be women with a set of unique experiences it's absolutely exclusionary and it's it's it don't you find it somehow dreadful that we are doing this work of exclusion and oppression that we as feminists are fighting at the same time do you know one of the things that's been happening over the course of my life is that women who had a raw deal when I started out getting an even worse deal now but nobody talks about it you know we can't run maternity centers week they open their clothes like clams when we get sent hither and yon we can't explain miscarriage so common a catastrophe why don't we understand menopause why don't we know it's not the fault of trans women is it what about relook at the problems over here both the point is I'm being told that I'm being exclusionary because I'm not taking on board Caitlyn Jenner's problems I can't take them on board I'm too concerned about the woman who died in the back of an ambulance when during a crisis of postpartum psychosis because they could suicide what do you mean why not when interviewers like me or others come along and say well what's your position why not say you know I don't wanna talk about that why make gratuitously offensive remarks you know you do Laurie mentioned pantomime Dame's gossip oh yeah there's stuff you've said I can't even say here because that happens to be a quotation from a book called the whole woman written years ago I have not been going around making these statements that is a quotation from a whole chapter about Jemaine I have quote here from you from 2009 2015 2018 do you have any regret for the way you've talked about this issue given this is a community which in the words of many human rights groups is facing an epidemic of violence no one say you're not entitled to your views but the way you've expressed your cellphone's you have any regrets I have to had to listen to so much stuff about an issue that doesn't interest me I've been forced to talk about transgender as now yes not once not twice for a thousand times and I think that the the male to female transgender community is very good at talking about itself very good at grabbing the headlines appears all over the place and is caressed by all and sundry that's fine go right ahead but don't expect me to join in I'm not somebody that's a really good self description as well but and let's go to the audience here who have been waiting patiently to come in raise your hands if you want to come in and ask remain some questions lady here in the front row thank you I'm from solace Women's Aid and we work with women who've experienced domestic and sexual abuse and one of the things I want to speak to you about ask you about is the lifelong experience of trauma that very many who have gone through what happens is that the blame that they experienced from the courts from the police but also from people around and society is obviously catastrophic me too is part of a culture of change and we need that culture of change and I'm asking you as an icon of feminism to stand up and to name misogyny and to challenge that rather than what you're talking about in terms of rape and the courts well I'm forever attacking misogyny and trying to get people to believe or understand how pervasive it is and how unconscious it is and our children to learn it from the time they're small and I think I I do understand about the lifelong state of a basement that can result from extended abuse from childhood onwards what about the trauma she talked about you've been quoted as dismissing some of the trauma that for example rape victims have have experienced absolutely not have you not the idea of them suffering PTSD for example oh listen when somebody tells me that you're more likely to suffer PTSD as a rape victim then you are as a veteran of foreign laws something's gone serious in your you say that in your position as a leading psychiatrist no I say that in my position as a rape victim thank you I mean every rape victim she was a horror but it does for all women I mean there have been studies done World Health Organization says PTSD is associated consistently with sexual violence one of most traumatic events you know more than the w-h-o yes I think so in that case II think about it the first thing that happens to you as a rape victim is you get told that this has ruined your life that you this you will never get over there to make sorry that's not what happens you know that before it even have a look well here's a here's a study in the u.s. study found that in the first two to three hours after an assault before people even gone to the police 96 percent of victims experience physical shaking trembling and shocked yeah that it happened here for you were run over by a bike oh really and truly this is your sexually this is getting silly the rape and being run over by bike and I'm the silly one no it's learning of the turning into something that happens every day we've already talked about the fact that rape is universal rape occurs in practically in every house in that in the land that non-consensual sex is everywhere and then you want to say and it'll drive you mad and you're heavy Penny's got a hand over her face and I'm sorry just the idea that the idea that it when you are when you experience rape the first thing is that you meant to be traumatized for life like as somebody who has also been raped but the first thing I was told when I went to try and talk to someone about it was that I was a liar and you know nothing had happened to me and I I swallowed that for 10 years even though you know I experienced pain and trauma from that and that's what these movements are trying to do they're trying to actually make violence and trauma visible and denormalize them because it's not just the case that rape is universal it's that we think it's okay we think that these behaviors are normal and we put the blame and the shame on women when we should be putting it on men I agree with it do you not see that I agree with that let's get let's go back to the audience the lady I in regards to your feminism how would you address someone who cannot simply slap down assault women who are oppressed by race class ability sexuality and fear of losing a job or in in in a vulnerable situation like a refugee camp anything like that and principles of your feminism feminism that's supposed to be an encompassing field of study and income seem way of living I'm not entirely sure that I'd quite understand the context of that I mean I understand what you're saying I'm saying you talked about people slapping it down dealing with it instantly not being victims some people are not in the same situation don't have the same privilege what I was actually talking about when that particular statement had a context was the fact that me too has brought up these cases after - as much as 20 years when the statute of limitations means that there can be no criminal prosecution now when it comes to intersectionality there's not a lot that I can say because I am what I am I'm a white middle class academic I am NOT God Almighty I don't understand what it's like to belong to a minority except that it's pretty interesting being an Australian in England Jemaine sorry to grab you on a contradiction a moment ago you were extrapolating from your own horrific experience to make sweeping judgment about what women experienced after violence now you're saying well I can only speak for myself yes okay introduction no I was speaking with myself as a rape victim it may surprise you to learn that I'm not a career rapey spend my entire life those phrases of yours upsets a lot of people be upset okay it's upsetting okay lady here and then the lady there hi my name is fat oh I work with a local charity here in Oxford called Oxford against cutting okay so you have said in the past that the way the women of my group treat their genitals is their business are you saying that charities like us should pack her bag and go home and you've also said that you wouldn't even condemn female genital mutilation at all how does that view fit in with the human rights agenda of saving all children from harm you and I both know that this is not a simple question that there are many different ways of doing cutting and they have different significance in different communities so we this is not an easy question but what annoys me is that we decide that African women or whoever from whichever community may not do these things to themselves and it's complicated but most people would say FGM wrong w-h-o says it's a gross violation of bring you better stop you men stop American women and English women from doing okay that's nice what about read the question is do you condemn it no no you don't you don't condemn no we do there are lots of cultural practices sake you can never finish a complicated point operation on the female genitalia in America is the shortening of the labia minora it's practically the same operation and it is practiced in great numbers we practice anyway okay so that's your position it should be going on cutting but adults are different okay gentleman in the glasses you seem to me to be a contrarian so my question is when in particular should we listen to you and perhaps when not so much I mentioned transgender issues you don't have to listen to me at all I don't have to listen to you either there's no cute except the label of contrarian no okay lady here it's about me - quite flip and I think made was kind of comedic content like you said something about Woody Allen should stop filmmaking because he's old rather than because of the alleged abuse of his younger daughter I never seen any such thing okay I'm sure in these big panic papers there's proof that you did say it but that's fine we'll do the contrarian ISM thing let me explain something no before I explain something can I ask you something because I picked up your book when I was 16 years old and that was my pathway into feminism and as you sit here before me you are just totally incompatible with the theory that I've read it's like surely high up on your agenda as a feminist is just less rape because you're delineating what counts as rape or not instead of having a conversation about what the psychosocial basis of rape is why are men raping is a better conversation then does that count as read for I don't know why I'm in a rape don't know why men are raping and I don't know which men are rape but that's your responsibility as a feminist academic and you have written texts that show that you do know why men are rate thing you do understand why there is a male hegemony you do understand how patriarchy translates into controlling sexual violence your own theory shows that so I just don't understand where you're coming from that Female Eunuch is not a book of theory I don't know how you've worked that out what is it what is it that okay what was it supposed to be a description of life as we lived it in 1969 when I wrote that people giving you're not gonna agree and we're running out of time let me just let me just do a follow you get I don't know what the answers gonna be but I'm asking anyway do you get a sense of disappointment when you hear people who will want big fans of yours now feeling disappointed in what you're saying today I never never asked for or wanted a big fan that's with respect I saw what I asked does it bug does it bother you at all that people who once agreed with you looked up to you now or not I'm not worried about being disagreed with what are we just wondering okay let's go to a lady there in the glasses I'm a huge me to campaign supporter and the reason why I supported the campaign was because it was an eye-opening campaign for me it made me realize how many women around me had been affected while I agree with you that a lot of women in the hollywood who have used sexual exploitation to climb up the ladder somehow weaken the voice strong women like you when you do not support the me to campaign you weaken the voice to what we really need is you to support the young women in this campaign and let us move ahead in this fight I'm sorry to be crabby about this but when umar Thurman tells me that Harvey Weinstein who was clearly a good friend pushed her down somewhere and then tried to expose himself and generally gives the account that she was in danger but she escaped and I think he tried to expose himself what stopped him how does he go to the toilet if he can't work out how to expose himself why did she why does she give us this narrative what does it mean yeah we wouldn't be this always have a go at but there are plenty of actresses and non actresses his assistant a marketing executive an advert and all of whom were his quote unquote whatever you want to call it you say victims are the business survivors yeah but do you not see what you're doing but you don't like the reason the reason for naming them is that they could finance the whole thing so far I've been told that there are civil suits being brought but I haven't found them and I do nothing but look that's your dismissive tone I think that it bothers people Zoe and then Laurie and then we have to finish very briefly I just I don't think we younger feminists do need Germaine to validate and sanctify what they're doing it's okay for you to be appalled and disappointed I personally am glad that Germaine is shaking things up ideological diversity is is great we all need it I think we're a little bit too prone to okay pouring so much yep terrain Laurie I mean a very briefly final words for ideological diversity but the question is how you know is is somebody who is still regarded by many as an icon supposed to support you know young women in their current struggle I think the answer has to be either by getting behind it in showing solidarity in a critical way or by getting out of the way because this is a distraction I didn't invite myself here tonight Mina and I'll tell you something else if there's anything I don't want to be it's an icon I grew up with holy pictures and I don't want to be one okay and I've never pretended to be one I'm not speaking on women's behalf I'm trying to talk sense especially in an environment where we seem to be talking a lot okay I'm slogan I mean it needs to come in briefly that's wonderful that you don't want to position yourself as an icon but you are too very many women so at least acknowledge Ruiz what I mean could you not just look at me too for what it is rather than have your single narrative that it's about Alma Thurman and Meryl Streep mito has been translated to Chinese did ish Arabic finish you have women in Nigeria Kenya India Brazil galvanizing and organizing and using me too I was at the EU Parliament where hundreds of feminists took over the inner Parliament on the back end of me to to speak about women gaining power in Europe so can you at least knowledge that there's all this other stuff going on it's not just Hollywood celebrities speaking about taking cocaine with Harvey Weinstein wait till something happens I mean so me too means nothing why be so negative you say sorry to be crabby why be so crabby because I want to be crabby I can be as crabby as I like even if it's like you even if it's unhelpful it's helpful I'm one person I'm being told to help all the women of the world or something or or say things that will be accepted by everybody let me ask you this last question on me too you know Laurie said at the start you know we've only been six months seven months in you keep saying let's see what happens do you have any regrets about how you've handled it at all I don't do regrets well what you call a person who has no regrets did probably but do you think you have any chance of you undoing your positions on me - last question any chance if they suddenly pull the rabbit out of the Hat if they actually managed to bring a case that they can actually win but I don't think they're going to that's my feeling but when they do I'll cheer on that very negative note Germaine Greer thanks for joining me on head-to-head and thanks to our panel you
