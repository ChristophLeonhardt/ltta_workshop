the NFL may be on the ropes and President Trump may have put them there the left demonstrates its definite scorn for the middle of the country and we'll talk about one of the worst movies ever made

to Realty shares calm / Ben okay so the football controversy a default controversy will not die ratings were apparently slightly up on Sunday over the previous year but that's because people were tuning in to see the controversy next week watch for the ratings to plummet as people simply tune out and demonstrate that they're not interested in watching a bunch of players who they feel are ungrateful for being in the United States of America and who are kneeling about the anthem and the flag so one of the things that I've been talking about for years on this program now is the idea that two bubbles have formed in the United States it's not just one bubble you know we on the right like to say well Hollywood's its bubble media there that's their bubble there are two bubbles there's the bubble of those of us on the right and the bubble of those of the people on the left in the right bubble we look at the people kneeling and we say everyone who's kneeling is doing so because they hate the Anthem in the flag right the reason that you kneel during the anthem is because you don't like the anthem and you think that America is a is a problematic place imbued inherently with racism sexism bigotry and homophobia and that's why you're kneeling it's because you don't like the flag and and there's some evidence to this Colin Kapernick when he first knelt said I'm doing this because the flag doesn't stand for black Americans which is just absurd it's just asinine it was the flag of the United States that was carried into battle by the black regiment during the Civil War that you can see it in the movie glory you know the flag has always stood for the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and the development toward a better America that's what the flag has always stood for which is why smart civil rights protesters back in the 1960s weren't burning the flag they were marching with the flag and saying this is our flag this is our America that's a smart way to protest a stupid way to protest is to kneel through the national anthem and to kneel as the as the flag is honored this she's a dumb way to do it so if they're on the right the way that you see this battle is all the people who are kneeling originally we're kneeling because they don't like the country and the people who are kneeling with them today are probably kneeling because they also don't really like the country too much then there's the way the left reads this which is people are kneeling because they think the country is not all that it can be and they are kneeling to demonstrate that the flag is not really being upheld even though symbolically it matters it's because it matters symbolically that we have to protest it and therefore that's that's why Kaepernick and company we're nailing originally and now all the people who are kneeling now it's not even because they agree with Kaepernick it's because they don't like the president Trump called for a boycott of the NFL and called for the NFL to fire everyone who is kneeling so there are two reasons for the kneeling reason number one is because America just isn't what it's supposed to be it's not all it's cracked up to be so Neil for the national anthem and reason number two is to protest Trump okay and these two visions of what exactly is happening it demonstrates it's sort of like the movie Rashomon I mean is it's it there's there's a bunch of there multiple viewers of a single event and they're each taking what they what they want from that event on the right we're taking away there are a lot of people who don't like the country on the Left they're taking away that they're a bunch of people who want to stand against America's fundamental values and kneeling is the way to protest those people right so that's the actual that that's actually what's going on from an objective if you're an alien coming in from outer space watching all of this this is what you would say right there's a bunch of different perspectives on the same event now I tend to think a few things one kneeling for the national anthem is done kneeling for the flag is done again you'd be better off grabbing the flag and saying this is my flag I stand with the flag against these forces that stand against American values so the kneeling is stupid the it's just it's it's pointless and it's it's bad PR on the other hand the people who are kneeling yesterday are not quite the same thing or Sunday not quite the same thing as Colin Kaepernick kneeling they're not all the same people Colin Kaepernick was basically kneeling by himself by the end of his career and the people who are kneeling yesterday a lot of them were people who were not on board with Colin Kaepernick kneeling for the anthem in the first place but they wanted to show solidarity for the right to kneel right in the same way that you sometimes see people sort of spite protest in order to in order to piss off the other side so there's some of that going on too okay so let's see how this plays out so you can see that on a political level this is very beneficial for Trump and pence so president Trump is has an arrant inerrant nose for the controversy that is most likely to polarize the country in his favor he's actually quite good at this and he's done it repeatedly so the left claimed after the travel ban Oh Americans hate the travel ban it's just gonna be terrible for Trump to travel ban the travel ban wasn't terrible for Trump most Americans were fine with the travel ban the left doesn't understand that the left doesn't understand that when President Trump says polarizing things on a wide variety of topics when he says that when we need a sort of macho posturing most Americans don't care about that and the left doesn't understand the one Trump says Colin Kaepernick is an sob for kneeling during the anthem there are a lot of Americans who feel the same way and when people Neil Trump wins that battle and you can see how the right is trying to frame the battle as don't protest the flag on the national anthem and the left is trying to protest is trying to frame the entire debate as a debate about the First Amendment so here's Mike Pence framing it in terms of the flag in the national anthem we've all got a right to our opinions but I don't think it's too much to ask the players in the National Football League to stand for our national anthem and I know the people of Alabama great because you know patriotism is what unites us it's about respect for the flag respect for the country and most importantly it's about respect for all those who fought and died to defend it and I think the Pence is exactly right of course which is why I've always opposed flag burning and kneeling on the flag and and pictures of Bill Ayers standing on the flag I think it's disgusting I think I think all of that is quite gross so this is how the rights attempting to frame it you see groups like the NRA doing the same thing the NRA released an ad yesterday last night that essentially says the same thing for the land of the free and the home of the brave from high school gyms to towering stadiums every time I see our flag wave I feel a humbling reminder of the brave who keep and have kept us free I stand to honor the sacrifices of the generations before me heroes who charge in the battle through bombs and bullets who lost their brothers and still push through fighting for every inch of our freedom I stand for my brothers who can't stand anymore men who hunted terrorists to the ends of the earth who sacrificed their bodies and their lives so that we could peacefully live ours I stand for the children the spouses and parents whose family made the friendly happens here right and it's actually a quite good ad here right this is this is an attempt to frame this specifically as all the people kneeling are doing a disservice to service members and spouses and children of people who have died in combat protecting the flag and protecting our national unity right that's the way the right is framing us now here's the way the left is friend mean it's like we're living in two separate worlds we're living in two separate worlds here's Hillary Clinton framing this in a completely different way it's as though you're watching two separate narratives happening at the same time protest is a part of the American Way of life and it's something that I'm very proud of whether I agree or disagree I think peaceful protest is part of what has helped us make progress learn more be a better country over time okay and this is what I don't like about what President Trump did is that these were both principles that we generally believed right pretty much all Americans believe this they should stand for the flag you shouldn't disrespect the flag shouldn't disrespect the anthem and also that what Hillary Clinton is saying about peaceful protest is basically correct that we in America have always valued peaceful protests we've always valued dissent we think that that's a valuable thing but now the left has basically grabbed hold of the dissents his patriotism banner and the right is grabs hold of the actual banner and now they're going to war with each other is that good for the country I don't think it's good for the country at all and then the left takes it too far so if that were the only battle then I would say okay easy consensus right easy to come together about this very simple we can bridge this gap immediately stop kneeling for the anthem and or at least or at least I understand why we criticize you for kneeling for the anthem it's bad to kneel for the anthem and also if you want to kneel for the anthem you know that's your business but we have a right to criticize you for doing so very easy consensus but then Hillary Clinton decides to take this even further and I'll explain that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at the u.s. ECA so can you say with percent confidence that you and your family are safe what if you pull the trigger too soon what if something breaks in your house and you pull the trigger too soon do you know

they provide you all the resources that you need in order to protect your family and in case god forbid you actually have to shoot somebody who is who is coming into your home to make sure that you and your family are protected in every conceivable way okay so as I say the normal battle should be it should be easy to fix standing for the national anthem is appropriate kneeling is inappropriate but this is America you're allowed to do it everybody calm down right that's that's the easiest way to do this Trump overstepped on the one end by using the flag to bash people who are who were kneeling to the extent same that they ought to be fired and then Hillary Clinton oversteps her boundaries not by defending the First Amendment by then implying that anyone who opposes people who kneel is a racist so here's Hillary Clinton doing that routine I think it's deeply troubling that the president would be attacking black athletes for expressing their opinions peacefully okay attacking black athletes as I said on Fox News last night President Trump is pretty equal-opportunity in who he attacks I mean Hillary Clinton gets it on the chin from president from virtually every single day and she's been not a relevant part of America's political scene for nearly a year at this point so the idea that Trump is only attacking black athletes really I mean he was attacking his own attorney general the same way like six weeks ago so know that that doesn't wash it all but again what we have here is a difference Louis CK's comedy routines adding Lucy kids really funny he has a comedy routine called called of course but Mamie and his comedy routine goes something like this he says of course of course we all understand that peanut allergies are things that we should be careful of and we should make sure that nobody around a kid who has a peanut allergy should have a peanut because we have to protect those kids I mean it's just something we have to do as a society of course we have to do that but maybe if we just let people carry around peanuts this would all be over in a generation right this is a dis Louie CK's routine the problem that we have in politics right now is that everybody is now doing of course but maybe everybody is now doing of course that may be so Trump is saying things like of course it's bad when people kneel for the anthem of course and of course dissent is okay but maybe all those people should be fired maybe all those people should be fired because I mean if they got fired and then no one would be kneeling for the end of them and then on the other side you have Hillary Clinton doing of course but maybe of course the the flag is important of course the national anthem is a good thing of course that's true but maybe president Trump is a brutal racist but maybe he's a Breughel racist and maybe people who stand for the flag are actually evidencing some sort of brutal racism because of the but maybes that we're all doing right now everybody's in conflict if we just stuck with you of courses and we skip the but maybes we'd all be fine because we of course we all agree on the stuff there's no major disagreement on this stuff even between people like me and Colin Kaepernick okay he may not agree about the the flag in the national anthem he may not agree about those things we have a serious disagreement there and we may have a serious disagreement about police procedure but we actually agree on the value of dissent I assume I assume we actually agree on that we at least go half way but now we don't even go half way now we're in total disagreement because of the but maybes okay so you can see the media is finally starting to catch on to this game Trump is making serious political hay here he's getting people to rally around him you can see that we'll show you in a second how the NFL is really stuck between a rock and a hard place but the media's Binion catch on that Trump is playing a game and they are falling for it here's CNN's Jim Acosta the the least self-aware reporter in America talking about how Trump is from trying to wage a culture war is he yeah you think this morning he's putting out a tweet praising NASCAR which obviously is geared towards a different demographic and the way they stand in respect and honor of the flag is he trying to wage something of a cultural war okay so he's here he's he trying to wage a culture of first of all the Left started this culture war by politicizing sports I have been saying this for years I have been saying this for a long time Trump did not start this war he has just escalated the war that's all he's just escalated the war and by the way this is this notion that the the NASCAR has a supremely different demographic from football is just not really true according to statistics in 2013 seventy seven percent of the television audience for the NFL was white seventy-seven percent fifteen percent was black eight percent was Hispanics the vast majority of the NFL audience is still white so the suggestion that Trump is doing this because he hates black people I just don't see the evidence of all that you know it's it's it's kind of its kind ridiculous in any case what's happened now is because Trump has has polarized the country even further than it already was on this and then the left has responded by polarizing even further by saying that everyone has to kneel everyone must kneel before Zod now the NFL is stuck between a rock and a hard place because their audience is 77% white and there are a lot of people in that audience white black and Hispanic who are not interested in doing this routine where they watch a bunch of people protest that America is a racist terrible terrible country they're not interested in doing that routine so Rush Limbaugh I think is actually good case study not just because Russia's is a right-winger obviously but because Rush is the biggest football fan on radio I mean he Russia's a super giant football fan so much so that ESPN tried to have him on Sunday NFL countdown about 15 years ago and here is Rush saying that for the first time in a long time he didn't watch any football on Sunday I was personally said and I did not watch the National Football League yesterday and it was the first time in 45 years that I made an active decision not to watch including my team the Pittsburgh Steelers it was not a decision made in anger it was genuine sad and it is said it is said these common symbols are being ripped away if you're an NFL owner or you're an NFL player though you are stuck now between a rock and a hard place because on the right they're saying you need to stand for the anthem and because Trump threatened because Trump basically said I want everyone to be fired the NFL should change its rules let's boycott now if you're an NFL player even if you don't like the kneeling you feel the necessity to stand by your teammates because if you're playing on a team you tend to stand by your teammates and their rights if you're an NFL owner you don't want to alienate the NFL Players Association nor do you want to alienate your own players by saying I'm gonna force you to stand but at the same time if you don't force your players to stand you're alienating the audience so the Dallas Cowboys last night tried to have it both ways the Dallas Cowboys basically Jerry Jones came out the owner of the team Trump supporter he came out and he kneeled down he knelt with with all the players before the anthem so the idea was that we're going to kneel to show free speech rights and to demonstrate that we care about equality and then during the anthem we're gonna stand ups we're gonna split the baby we won't Ashley Neal during the anthem so we're not disrespecting the anthem or the flag but we are going to protest President Trump by kneeling before the by kneeling before the anthem the problem is everybody in the stadium thinks that Trump is sort of right about the kneeling and so they say okay you're really siding with all the players who are kneeling before the anthem this is the this is one of the dark places that we've gone in sort of our First Amendment discourse is if we don't like how you exercise your First Amendment rights then we suggest that you that the First Amendment itself is the problem or that if you stand up for the First Amendment you're standing up for the worst excesses of the First Amendment I get this all the time you know I make the case the people should be allowed to speak on college campuses and then people say so are you for Nazis saying that they want to roast Jews and I was like well no I'm not for that but they have the right to say that kind of stuff right we live in America right the people do the same thing all the time I'm the left right they they do this with religious bakers when I say that I think you should be able to own and operate your business the way that you see fit and then the left says what are you for discriminating against black people in gays I say well no no I'm not actually for that I'm not for that at all but you have a right to do what you want with your own business rights and inherently contain the capacity to misuse those rights the problem is when you symbolically stand up for the right i parts depending in the same sort of act as the people who are misusing the right then you're going to be lumped in with them and that's what happened to cowboys last night so here's what happened last night with Jerry Jones and the cowboys and listen to the crowd just wanted to show unity but they were very adamant about wanting to separate that message from the national anthem all right lease it as they take any collectively booze can be heard from this sellout crowd in Arizona and you can hear the audience booing of course and they are booing because again they are identifying the kneeling because of the symbolic because of the the symbology the symbolism of the kneeling the people are booing they weren't booing until they now the minute that they know people lump them in with Colin Kaepernick and this is how this conflict is gonna go for the NFL if you kneel we're gonna lump you into Colin Kaepernick if you don't kneel we're gonna lump um with Trump these are the two choices now we didn't have to make that choice before but now that's the choice that popular media are forcing us to make it's the choice Trump wants to make it's the it's the choice Pence wants to make it's the choice that on the Left Hillary Clinton wants you to make they want you to pick sides are you with LeBron James and Steph Curry and Colin Kaepernick are you with Jerry Jones and Bob Kraft or are you with Donald Trump and Mike Pence and the soldiers right that's the choice people want you to make this is not a choice you have to make you can be for the soldiers don't kneel and you can also not bit and you can also be for Colin Kaepernick's right to kneel right can do to both of these things but because the NFL is trying to to thread this needle they're gonna end up just destroying themselves and you can see it yesterday I paid homage to a guy named - Alejandro Villanueva right Alejandro Villanueva was an offensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers and he served three tours in Afghanistan he was an Army Ranger and he came out during the during the anthem the rest of the Steelers team stayed in the locker room Villanueva came out and put his hand over his heart for the anthem and I said well that's I think a courageous move yesterday he was forced to apologize after the left came after an inch are pet that Villanueva was just totally wrong how dare Villanueva go out there alone he humiliated his teammates Shannon was feeling the way those rights were wrong I believe he was wrong in this situation skill I believe he put his personal feelings and beliefs in front of that of the team and this is a team now what we know about the military the military asked a man to put his life his or her life in the hands of another man true when you go outside of that protocol people life are at risk that is correct that's what a Colonel jessep said in a few good men okay again this is so stupid sorry I love the idea from Shannon Sharpe that how dare he how dare Villanueva put himself ahead of his team his personal feelings ahead of his team what do you think Colin Kapernick was doing do you think that he actually went through the loop 49ers locker room and asked permission before he did what he did so you're allowed to put your opinion ahead of the team when you're kneeling for the anthem but you're not allowed to do that when you are when you are standing up for the American flag bill in a way that ends up apologizing for all of this because again this is the problem you're either with now you're being forced to make a choice you're the with your team and therefore with Colin Kaepernick by extension or you're with Donald Trump that's a crappy choice most Americans don't want to make that choice we're gonna show you the tape of Illinois of apologizing which I just think is awful in one second but first I want to say thank

looks nicer than anything else that you'll get on the market okay so here is here's this Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman being forced to apologize because he didn't stand by his teammates cuz you either stand by the people who are knee or your you're a bad guy now Alice of this plan very few players knew that I was going to the tunnel because I only asked the team leadership and so because of that I didn't give them an opportunity to stand with me mindful that that is the very embarrassing part am I in and what transpires because when everybody sees an image of me standing by myself everybody thinks that the team of the Steelers are not behind me and that's absolutely wrong it's quite the opposite is they all would have actually the entire team would have been out there with me even the ones that want to take a knee would have been there we have they know these extreme circumstances that at Soldier Field you know the heat of the moment when I got soldiers wooden veterans texted me that you know that I have to be out there then I think I think aside from every single one of my team is no doubt so because of that I've made Steelers ball for not going out there and figuring this thing out beforehand that's their fault okay that's not Villanueva's job to stay in the locker room with his idiot teammates he won't come out for the anthem if they want to come out and lock arms and some of them Neal and some of them don't that's fine but to rip on and Villanueva's though he did something totally wrong for coming out after serving three tours in Afghanistan all these guys can just you know stick it where the Sun don't shine really really obnoxious and again this is the sort of thing where people are not gonna watch the NFL because of it so the NFL is gonna get absolutely hammered in the ratings next week you watch for it meanwhile the left is getting more and more snarky about this so as you see the posturing from some people on the right about the flag and the anthem and the idea that everybody who is protesting in any way must hate the flag and anthem which I don't think is true I'm gonna show you some scorn from the left that is truly off-putting and demonstrative of just why what from said is so effective politically but we're gonna go through all that a particularly spurs coach Gregg Popovich said some pretty amazing things yesterday LeBron James two will go through all of it but for that you're gonna have to go over to Daley wire comm for $9.99 you can get your subscription to daily wire comm you get the rest of this show live you get

largest fastest growing podcast in the nation all right so the left's corn is truly astonishing and this is the part where Trump triggered the left into making the mistake of going full Kapernick never go full Kapernick again the winning strategy for the left here was we stand with the right of people to kneel even if we disagree with their kneeling that's the proper strategy the left cannot help themselves and so they feel the necessity to rip America generally so here's gregg popovich was a very left guy the coach of the San Antonio Spurs very brusque fellow is talking about how America is an embarrassment to the world now we're countries an embarrassment in the world this is this is an individual actually thought that when people held arms during the games that they were doing it to honor the flag that's delusional absolutely delusional but it's what we have to live with so you got a choice we can continue to bounce our heads off the wall with his conduct or we can decide that the institutions of our country are more important that people are more important that the decent America that we all thought we had and want is more important and get down to business at the grassroots level and do we have to do okay the idea that everybody is embarrassed by the United States first of all the idea that we're in embarrassments the world to whom well we embarrass the Germans whoopty frickin do like anyone cares about that will be embarrassing Bob why we embarrass Communist China to embarrass Putin like who do we embarrass we embarrass Syria those sorts of statements are so obnoxious that they're just ridiculous and then Popovich said stuff away he went on to say that if you're a white person in America you never understand what it's like to be black if that's the case you cannot have a functioning Republic the whole point of a functioning Republic is that you can think beyond your own self-interest and think about what's good for the country and try to get in the head of somebody else and get in their shoes the idea that inherently if you're a black person that you can if you're a white person you can never understand what it's like to be somebody black well that's really stupid particularly because there are lots of different types of white people and lots of different types of black people it plays directly into the racist stereotypes that underlie Kaepernick's nonsense and this is again this is where the left is going the left is fully embracing the radicalism now Trump has forced them out of the closet and they're embracing the radicalism dan Patrick talk-show host he says you know the American flag it's just not the same thing to black Americans and white Americans the flag represents something different to other people certainly white people can look at it go that flag hey my father fought my dad was marine I mean I might have to sit down and have a discussion if my father were alive to say this is what's going on but hopefully you could have a dialogue that says this is why they're doing it it's not about the flag it's about far more than that to them the flag is not the same thing to them as it is to us and I'm saying white America the flag is not the same thing to black people as it is white people really I think the flag is the same thing to everybody I think that we should all have as Americans we have a common stake in the future of the country and in the history of ideas in the country I don't think that unity is impossible in the country see this is where I I divide from the left and I divide from President Trump I don't think that unity is impossible on these sorts of issues I think that we can find unity in saying the American flag stands for what's best about America and we are always attempting to perfect the country in pursuit of that goal and we shouldn't protest the one symbol that we hold in common and we have so few now as it is but again the left to the left to radicalism it's just when people say the Trump is the divider Trump is a divider he's not the divider there are a lot of people who are quite divisive LeBron James decides that he has to sound off to now and here's LeBron talking about how stupid voters are American voters are for voting for Trump I don't think a lot of people was educated and and I think that's the biggest one of the biggest problems that we haven't when it becomes a vote time that people are just not educated on either the individual or what's actually going on in the state of the world right now not like that particular state but in the state of the world I don't think a lot of people are educated and they make choice they make choices and say things that's uneducated educated this from from from LeBron James the people wasn't educated weren't ya again like that's not just being snarky saying to people that they are uneducated about their vote and that's why they're voting the way that they are maybe they just have different principles than you maybe they have different beliefs maybe the different sources of information than you but again this is all super polarizing stuff as I said yesterday LeBron James ripping other people on their level of education yeah I went directly from high school to the NBA okay I'm in the he may be an intelligent guy you know I have I have no evidence that he's a dumb dumb but I would not put I would not put my vote on the peg of education if I went directly from high school to the NBA and that was my entire experience in in higher education again don't use that you can say that that people are making stupid stupid votes that that I think is fair on every side but to say uneducated when your educational background is what LeBrons is I think a little bit ironic at the very least so again the left falling into Trump's trap by becoming ever more radical as part of Trump's trap Jesse Williams who's an actor that nobody's heard of since he did what it was he on Grey's Anatomy or something and he hasn't done anything since but he hangs out so that he can say things about how America's terrible every so often on MSNBC so they took him out of storage they unmasked balled him and then they and then they talked to him about the national anthem protests I think Thomas it's also important to realize that this anthem thing is a scam this is not actually part of football this was invented in 2009 as from the government paying the NFL to market military recruitment to get more people to go off and fight wars to die this is not nothing to do with NFL or American pastime or tradition this is to get boys and girls to go fly overseas and go kill people in the military so ugly and ask people to join the military you know the military that defends this morons right to speak how dare the military go to the NFL crowd and and make as though the military is a useful thing just horrifying so again Trump has told the left into being as left as it possibly can be and at the same time he has made an unprincipled right give up on certain principles like the President of the United States should not be interfering with private business operations they given up on that because it's more important to to shout about the flag in the national anthem so yes everything remains just as stupid as it was yesterday again no Disneyland okay time for some things I like and then some things I hate and then we'll deconstruct some culture so things that I like today Peter Thiel who is a he was a trump supporter he is the founder of the co-founder of PayPal he's an investor in facebook he's one of the top minds in Silicon Valley and his original investment group in PayPal included people like Elon Musk it's like every it was like seven members and all of them have started billion-dollar companies a brilliant guy Peter Thiel he wrote a book called zero to one notes on startups or how we build the future and it's a really good book it's a short books about 180 pages very quick read but it's got some deep thoughts about how you ought to think about your business and how you ought to think about your life and what I like about feel is that he's very optimistic in his vision for people taking control of their own lives he's very libertarian Thiel and SMI so that means that we have a lot in common and and I think that Peters book is quite good so go out and pick up the book zero and one by Peter Thiel okay other things that I like you know this thing belongs in things I hate so this will be the shortest things I like ever lets you go directly to things I hate okay so let's begin with Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders did a debate on health care last night with Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham which is just I mean that's that's basically TV death and you turn in for five minutes and and then the ratings must have been great on CNN for this thing because people tuned in for five minutes and they died at their remote so arbitron and nielsen were still registering that they were watching because they have no idea they're dead in any case poni Sanders of Vermont he explains that health care is a right why is health care right because everybody else says it's right but that is not good enough our job now is to come together to craft serious short-term solutions that addresses the real problems that exist like deductibles high co-payments high premiums high costs the prescription drugs but longer-term we have got to come together and finally conclude that it's a nation we cannot be the only nation major nation on earth not to see healthcare as a right thank you very much not be the only major nation on earth not to see abortion as a right we cannot be the only major nation on earth not to spend 80 percent of our GDP on social programs what is this nonsense about we can't be the only major nation on earth to do X or Y or Z we cannot be the only Bernie Sanders circa 1775 we cannot be the only major nation on earth not to have a king we must have a king everyone else has the king why cannot we have a king have they even created pudding yet I do not think so so the this notion that that we are going to declare healthcare right because France declares healthcare right is the stupidest crap I ever heard make an affirmative case for why saying that is going to make healthcare better but don't say that just because other nations say stuff therefore we ought to say stuff I mean this falls into the same category is Popovich saying that we're an embarrassment to the world yeah we only provide half the world's economic growth yeah we're the embarrassments of the world okay other things that I hate so there is an unbelievable ah panting the New York Times today I don't know what's going on over at the New York Times editorial page but they have obviously decided that it is deeply important to promote communism in the last several months they've run the following headlines when communism inspired Americans April 29 2017 when the Harlem Renaissance went communist August 21st 2017 socialism's future maybe it's past June 26th mm mm 17 and of course why women had better sex under socialism August 12th 2017 today's entry okay this is what they tweeted out for all its flaws the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big for all its flaws let me read that again slowly so that you understand how stupid this is for all its flaws the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big yes it taught them to dream big and then die okay the the Great Leap Forward cost 40 million lives overall Chinese communism has cost 65 million dead people 35 million of those are probably women a forced abortion in China has caused the death of by some reports of at least a hundred and ninety-one million female babies a hundred and ninety-one million female babies aborted since the Communist revolution in China according to some studies which means that right now China has a shortfall in women they've 30 thirty to forty million more men than women in China which is actually a serious demographic problem when countries tend to have far more men than women they're more likely to be militarized and go to war because you got a lot of horny guys hanging around who aren't married and don't have families but the New York Times op-ed says no no you don't understand communism was great for women so here's the glowing reminisce quote the Communists did many terrible things my grandmother always says at the end of her reminisces but they made women's lives much better that oft-repeated dictum sums up the popular perception of Mao Zedong regarding women in China as every Chinese school child learns in history class the Communists rescued peasant daughters from urban brothels and ushered cloistered wives into factories liberating them from the oppression of Confucian patriarchy patriarchy and imperialist threat you know what actually has created women's rights capitalism gang na communism capitalism or women freer today Communist China or the United States or France or Britain or Germany or Denmark all of which are capitalist countries ok Denmark is far more like the United States than it is like like China in terms of how its economy is run this notion that women were liberated liberated to do what starve this is all reminiscent of how the left talks about people like Fidel Castro no Chavez at least before people are eating dogs in the streets of Venezuela Fidel he brought health care he brought health care to the people sure thousands of them are in prison for descent sure they're they hate the island so much they're attempting to float off the island with 1950s cars and the tires inflated sure but he had health care didn't he and literacy went up it's so ridiculous ok the the here's what it says says while the communist revolution brought women more job opportunities it also made their interest subordinate to collective goals stopping at the household doorstep mouths words and policies did little to alleviate women's domestic burdens like housework and childcare so didn't do anything just told women that they could be leaders of the re-education camps again the New York Times propping up communism is quite an amazing sight so the left really really out of the closet on this stuff now ok time for a little bit of deconstructing the culture so deconstructing the culture today why don't we begin with this incredible video you were talking about scorn of one side for the other there's a video that's now come out with a few actresses I don't actually know some of these actresses I guess one of them is Ellen Page I'm not sure who the other actresses are here but they cut a video for the a/v Club and the onion talking about they're not going to date Trump supporters you know good luck with that it's like the bubble that the self-righteous bubble these people have created it's quite amazing and now the sports world is bubbling itself off in the same way that the entertainment world is that there's a Sports Illustrated cover showing a bunch of people in sports we all stand together Hollywood does this routine we all stand together guess what the rest of America thinks you're just awful so here's this little video with Ellen Page and unnamed other people who I will find out in just a moment saying they would never date a trump supporter but I think in the end they you know everyone's starting to see sort of what's happening and I want to go on because I can go under for way too long but like no no I don't think I could get it you're a trump supporter well at any point because you've been saying this the whole time but by this point I'm sorry no okay no we've never dated Trump supporters just never do it okay it's kate mara and Ellen Page and Amy Simon so we're in a new movie that looks awful called my days of mercy which looks just terrible kate mara and Ellen Page play lovers on the opposite ends of the political spectrum pages Lucy a woman who is vehemently opposed to the death penalty while Mara's mercy is in support of it good luck all right so you wonder why Americans look at Holly wouldn't they say we want no part of you this is why you want to write movie receipts her down part of it is because the movies are crappy part of is because the tickets are expensive and part of it is because you people keep alienating us and annoying us can the same thing is about to happen in the sporting world in other entertainment news the Amazon has decided that it is imperative to show full frontal transgender full frontal nudity on TV they really did this in the the other day they show a the person in the rear of this photograph is a man who has had a boob job that's all that's happened here Alexandra Billings is the name of this of this actual transgender person who is in transparent and and so they I don't know if we just have the picture or if there's the actual scene I hope just the picture because I don't actually want to see the scene in any case this person turns around and has breasts and a penis and this is supposed to be some sort of some sort of step forward for the transgender community now we're all supposed to I love the descriptions in the media it's pretty amazing in the media in The Daily Beast they say thing it's just it's just incredible because we really wanted to show her penis her penis excuse me yeah so on the one hand is again this is just pushing more cultural boundaries that we're supposed to pretend that all of this is that this person is actually a woman but on the other hand there is something to the idea that the shocking vision of a of a man with breasts will may dissuade some folks that this is actually a woman because when you see that that does not eat that that's clearly a man so good good job Amazon for for creating programming that just yeah what's the point of all this what's the point of all this I mean this is just what they do okay final final note on deconstructing the culture I have no words for these things final note there's a movie called mother and our own Michael Mills who's wrong about virtually everything is wrong about this too he says that the movie mother is just a wonderful biblical allegory so the movie is a biblical allegory Darren Aronofsky is the worst director ever Darren offski is hot garbage Darren Aronofsky is the emoji movie shot on a handheld camera and with people shooting up that's Darren Darren Aronofsky every Darren Aronofsky movie is the same it's all hysterical and ludicrous and filled with looks inside people's heads that no one cares about it's always a dark creepy place cuz Darren Aronofsky's a weirdo okay his new movie mother is another one of these routines in the same line by the way if you ever want to watch a truly awful film go watch no I know as a truly awful film that does not understand the Bible and so he's made a new film that's basically in the same vein it's Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem hard Javier Bardem plays a writer with writer's block who's supposed to obviously be God Jennifer Lawrence is supposed to be the Virgin Mary in this allegory it's such a bad movie that CinemaScore gave it an F okay you know how to get an F on cinema score you know you know how much you have to disappoint audiences to get an F on cinema score you have to basically shoot them in the head okay to get an F on cinema score like the audiences will give it they'll give lay like night out like that crappy Scarlett Johansson film those knockoff at The Hangover look at that b-minus on on cinema score it's got an F and I got an F because it it degrades into this bizarre orgy of blood and violence and fire and the whole idea is supposed to be that humanity man and woman come to this house with that's owned by Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence an they start ruining the house and making everything terrible and all these people start showing up because humans are a scourge on the earth which was the same message that he promised he promoted in Noah which is garbage here's the preview they tried to pitch this as a horror film because they knew nobody would want to watch a movie about how human beings are garbage and ruin the earth so instead they tried to promote this in the normal horror film we spend all our time here I want to make a paradise she redid all of it every last detail when she breathed life back into everyone here happy I love you please coming hello hey look a shaky cam thanks Derek Ranger right just gonna let him sleep in our house hello hello did you know he had a wife it's creepy are they ghosts is the house haunted no it turns out none of that crap is true it's just all a really bad biblical allegory for a guy who has never really studied the Bible in any depth and and I believe Aronofsky's a self proclaimed proclaimed atheists Oh note to self proclaimed atheists please stop making religiously allegorical movies you don't know what the hell you're talking about okay I'm not making an atheist film I would suggest that you not make a religious film if you don't know what in the world you're talking about more evidence that Hollywood hates the country and that's exactly what Aronofsky said by the way he said the audience's don't get it because they're illiterate yeah thanks guys they I can't imagine why all of us are turning off our TVs and ignoring you okay we'll be back here tomorrow with the latest in the stupidity vortex as it continues to build into that category 5 hurricane that will wipe all intellectual life from the planet roof do better today guys tomorrow by the way we'll be in Utah so if you're a University of Utah I think we're sold out but there may be overflow rooms so check it out but we'll see you there if you dar I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show you
