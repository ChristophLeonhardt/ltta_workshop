at this point in the election cycle many of you may be confused you may be saying to yourself wait if my child gets killed does that mean I can criticize politicians or not after all you saw Kaiser Khan at the Democratic convention his son was a heroic American soldier who died in the Iraq war and he criticized Donald Trump for wanting to limit Islamic immigration trump attacked him back and the media said Trump was very bad but what about Patricia Smith her diplomats son died at Benghazi and she criticized Hillary Clinton at the Republican convention for not sending help and for lying about it and the media said Patricia Smith was very bad likewise when cindy sheehan son an american soldier was killed in iraq she protested against george w bush and she received international media attention but when cindy sheehan son an american soldier was killed in iraq she protested against barack obama and was completely ignored so you might be forgiven if you turn to your spouse where she lies prostrate sobbing inconsolably on the kitchen floor and said jinke Winkies honey now that the kids dead are we supposed to make political statements or not well luckily for you the mainstream media in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee have issued these official guidelines to help you figure out whether your soul crushing tragedy has political value or just one of those things and tough luck for instance if your child is black and is shot dead by a white police officer while trying to kill him congratulations you're a mother of the movement and you now have so much moral authority that you can speak tearfully about the problem of systemic racist policing even though the problem doesn't actually exist so that's good right but if your child is black and a shot dead by another black person while lying in her mom's bet doing her homework oh sorry you should really keep your anguish to yourself because bringing that up would make you kind of hateful and racist like Rudy Giuliani or someone if your child is gay and killed by a homophobe excellent you have a great talk show career ahead of you if your child is gay and killed by a Muslim man that's not so good but you're still young maybe you could have another gay child and have him killed by a homophobe next time so buck up if your child is killed by an illegal alien try to forget about it just pretend she never existed you have no future in politics if these official MSM DNC guidelines of how moral authority you have after your child's death still leave you feeling confused here's what you can do just arrange to have your child killed before he's even born then you're golden and can spend the rest of your life going on television to talk about how happy you are because the kind of dead cha the Democrats in the media like best he's the one they've killed themselves trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan trail hi ho better I'm sorry I'm surrounded by Hippocrates buffoons an idiot so that's that's all I have to say about that you know this well this was not the worst clay blows we can ever I think only see police officers were killed so we're actually improving over the time being and just the rest of it was the usual stupidity and nonsense and and I saw Jason Bourne so we will be talking I have a lot of interesting stuff they'll be no spoilers but I have a lot of interesting stuff to say about Jason Bourne and other movies like it so stay tuned i know you can watch on facebook for 15 minutes have i got that right and then move over to the daily wire and hear the rest of it and if you subscribe you can see the rest of it and it's so beautiful I mean that just can't even begin to describe what you're missing if you're not watching it and if you subscribe you can be in the mail bag and will answer all your questions on the Wednesday mailbag show we have a good week coming up I think Steve crowd is going to be here on Thursday so that they should be and I guess they're the cleanup crews will have to come in after that so early polls are showing a convention bounce for Hillary Clinton is still not sure it hasn't shown up on the RCP average but then that's an average going back into July but it seems like it's hard to tell whether she did she have a good convention or is it just easier to have a convention when the media is cleaning up the mess for you and talking about how great everything is and you know where is the Republican convention the media is just hitting them again and again every it's dark and everything's wrong and all their divisions I mean there are people outside the Democratic convention not only burning the flag but setting themselves on fire while they were burning the flag the ultimate and karma report the first is just oh they're just not covering that we're just not going to do that but the top of the convention I mean Hillary Clinton's speech was one of the dullest thing she that woman I keep saying she has to she has to really show us who she is like we don't know she's been in the public eye forty years we know who she is that's the problem the problem is who she is but she gets up and she gives us terrible scream it was all the lead ins I mean Obama gave a good speech or Michelle gave a good speech and then of course there was Kaiser Khan and his wife who stood up and these people are gold star parents of a son who was a genuine captain Kahn he was a genuine genuine hero in Iraq was you know sent his his saw truck coming toward them sent his underlings away from the truck ran toward the truck in the truck was of course loaded with an ID was a suicide bombing it blew up so Khan gets up and he essentially chastises Donald Trump for wanting to limit Muslim immigration so here's a portion of that speech Donald Trump you're asking Americans to trust you with their future let me ask you have you even read the United States Constitution I will I will gladly lend you my coffee in this document look for the words look for the words liberty and equal protection of law have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery go look at the graves of brave Patriots who died defending United States of America you will see all faiths genders and ethnicities you have sacrificed nothing and no one so great speech it's a really is a powerful speech and of course the Democrats he holds up the Constitution the Democrats are cheering they're turning to each other what are we cheering for the consulate to what's lad that's the thing we're always trying to get rid of the Constitution so we can do what we want you know and also just listen I for all I know the guy really does walk around with the Constitution in his pocket most of the people i know who walk around with a constitution of the pocket our tea party people those are the people so the this whole thing about democrats cheering for the Constitution still look you gotta give him this is politics they landed a good punch they landed a good punch so now Trump responds on the George Stephanopoulos show and the the best thing I can say about Donald Trump is he tried not to be himself he gave his the best thing I can say about him is Donald Trump tried for a few minutes not to be Donald Trump so here's his first response to the the con speech with Stephanopoulos he was you know very emotional and probably looked like a nice guy to me his wife if you look at his wife she was standing there she had nothing to say she probably maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say you tell me but plenty of people have written that she she was extremely quiet and it looked like she had nothing to say a lot of people have said that and personally I watched him I wish him the best of luck he tries he's trying not to be Donald about like an outlet and Donald I'm to meet Oliver to use health's the godswife in sort of making making the point that because she's a Muslim woman she's not to say anything and of course she responded she writes him a very eloquent letter telling him to get stuffed as he deserved you know shut up all you had to say was yeah that's very sad but but it was Hillary Clinton who voted for the Iraq war not Donald Trump it was Hillary Clinton who when the going got tough started to stand against the Iraq war turned her back on Captain Khan and his fellow soldiers it was George W Bush ruinin and fought for those guys and gave him the search against everybody's advice against everybody's urging george w bush went in and won that war essentially with a surge so Trump has nothing to apologize for there's no you know he's talking about something else as he makes this point here's the second cut when would you say to that father well I'd say we've had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism that's what I'd say we have a lot of problems where you look at San Bernardino you look at Orlando you look at the World Trade Center you look at so many different things you look at what happened to the priest over the weekend in Paris where his throat was cut eighty-five-year-old beloved Catholic priest you look at what happened in Nice France a couple of weeks ago I'd say you got to take a look at that because something's going on and it's not good fair enough right i mean that's what he's talking about he's talking about Islamic terrorism we all know that there are great islamic patriots around that's not the point there is a problem in the Islamic world there was a cancer of violence we don't know whether it grows in you know its inherent in Islam itself that's the great question of the age I think a lot of people should be studying that but we do know that it's a problem and the problem is is that if you're going to get blown up if you're going to get shot it's probably going to be by an Islamic guy and that's what he's worried about which is fair enough but it just can't stop you know there's something in this guy it's not that he doesn't want to win I don't I can't speak to that I don't know maybe he's doing the whole thing as a lark but when he is personally attacked he personally attacks back he has not got that thing in him that most of us have where they say you know what maybe this wouldn't be the best idea maybe this person you know has a to be emotional or angry it doesn't make you know the fact that their child died heroically doesn't make their political point any better he could have there was a way to respond I mean and yes I know Hillary Clinton has essentially dist patricia smith brought home those coffins from Benghazi and lied and stood by those coffins and lied into the faces of those parents it's inexcusable but this is all so ridiculous to hear Stephanopoulos asks him has he sacrificed anything he said you have sacrificed nothing and no one well that sounds who wrote that did Hillary's script writers write it how would you answer that father what sacrifice have you made for your country I think I made a lot of sacrifices I work very very hard I've created thousands and thousands of jobs tens of thousands of jobs I think those are sacrifices oh sure I think those sacrifices I think when I can employ thousands and thousands of people take care of their education take care of so many things even in military mean I was very responsible along with a group of people for getting the Vietnam Memorial built in downtown Manhattan which to this day people thank me for I raised and I have raised millions of dollars for the vets I'm helping the vets a lot I think my popularity with the vets is through the roof are you the vets it reminds me of the story you remember the story of the frog and the Scorpion the Frog says the Scorpion says to the Frog take me across the river and the Frog says will won't you sting me in the Scorpion says no I wouldn't sting you because then we'll sink and we'll both drown so he the Frog let's the Scorpion ride on his back and halfway across the river the scorpion stings him in this fog started to die and they both go down and that before they both drown the Fox is well why did you do that in the Scorpion says I'm a scorpion it's my nature it's this I think Donald Trump it's like Donald why did you attack the gold star parent well I'm Donald Trump it's my nature and here he is explaining to megyn kelly why he does these things I do if I thought I would not be this hard I go hard I grew bored I'm familiar sit down everybody leadership down that you sit down they don't suppress it down the engine down to brush it down they don't you touch it down two down two down two down two down she's just down didn't shit down if I don't go all the way I don't understand place is gonna change and my and knock that money and life everybody I don't look back I'm not stupid it's about and if management the phone against major loser retreat watching over the tree three games on to be updated to me and I backwards that's from song of 5 2016 it auto tuning all the candidates I love that one I go hard he's got weight if you kiddin sees waving a gun around and all the stuff anyway so that's so that's Trump but let's let's take a look at Clinton for a minute cuz Clinton now as you know the New York Times doesn't even mention this on their front page today it's all about Trump this is a turning point he attacked calm you know it's the wrath of khan it's a turning point you know i mean this is this has happened to trump maybe 15 times where he's been pronounced dead and every time his poll numbers go up so well it's only we'll have to wait and see what the people's reaction to this is but meanwhile meanwhile hilary clinton gives an interview to chris wallace on fox and wallace asks her about the emails and she lies again g listen to this would have played the first cut after a long investigation FBI director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public we're true Chris that's not what I heard director Comey say and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to in my view clarify director Comey said that my answers were truthful and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retro actively certain of the emails I was communicating with over 300 people in my emailing they certainly did not believe and had no reason to believe that what they were sending was classified now in retrospect different agencies come in and said well it should have been but that's not what was happening in real time okay so she lies again and then we're gonna have to stop here just for a minute and say goodbye to our friends on Facebook come over the daily wire and hear the rest of the show so so comee the entire nation heard Comey call her a liar point after point after point he Illustrated he'd investigated this for months and months and he said you know she said this but this wasn't true but she's still that's not what I heard that's not you know in Clinton world in my imagination everything's fine so Wallace goes after again and she still does it listen listen to this he plays the he plays the tape for in a congressional hearing on July seventh director call me directly contradicted what you had told the public sector Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails either sent or received was that true that's not true Secretary Clinton said I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email there is no classified material was that true that there was classified material email he directly contradicted well I let me just touch that he not only directly contradicted what you said he also said in that hearing that you were extremely careless and negligent well Chris I looked at the whole transcript of everything that was said and what i believe is number one I made a mistake not using two different email addresses I have said that and I repeat it again today it is certainly not anything that I ever would do again I take classification seriously I relied on and had every reason to rely on the judgments of the professionals with whom I worked and so in retrospect maybe some people are saying well those among those 300 people they made the wrong call at the time there was no reason in my view to doubt the professionalism and the determination by the people who work every single day on behalf of our country so she throws the entire state department under the bus yeah yeah okay it may look like I lied but it was really their fault you know she's a terrible human these people they should really get married they should really get married and leave the rest of us alone that would just they deserve each other on top of which I have to say this when when Kaiser Khan says Donald Trump hasn't read the Constitution I believe that is a hundred percent accurate I do not believe that Donald Trump has the attention span to read the Constitution and try and understand what's in it and try to understand why when people say oh you know maybe you shouldn't torture our prisoners why there may be a reason for that or why you know you can't stop the press from saying what they want to say I truly believe that my problem is that Hillary Clinton has read the Constitution and she wants to destroy it you know every time you hear her say I'm going to repeat every time she says the words Citizens United you should hear First Amendment when she says Citizens United she means the First Amendment because all citizens united says is that you do not lose your First Amendment rights when you form a corporation if I form a corporation with the people in this room and we make a film criticizing Hillary Clinton we do not lose our right to publicize that film before an election because it's a corporation giving money she says oh that's corporate donations as money out of control money is speech that's all it is in a political context money is speech and so when she says she wants to ban money enforced exclosure and overturn citizens united she's talking about getting rid of the First Amendment and she even says I'll pass an amendment to do it and so you know the thing that's so galling about this election I have to say is that for me as a conservative that I've said this a million times the elections over I lost we already know this the constitutional governance is not on the ticket this this election year so it's it's we've lost and all I sit around and think about at this point is who do I hate more do I hate these alt right Nazis who attack me every time I attack Trump and they're anti-semitic and their and white supremacist and they're just it just trash you know I mean is everything it's everything I think all of us on the right on a principle right despise you know we don't like these guys and and I hate them but i have to say i just don't think they're that many of them you know i think they have a billion twitter accounts i think they troll every website relentless Lee and compulsively but I don't think they're going to have that kind of effect and also just talking in terms of pure venom on from me I'm pure hatred I think they're already have their punishment because they're themselves I mean I can't imagine anything worse than sitting in your mothers basements doing in your racial hatred and rage you know and like who who has nothing to be proud of except the color of their skin you know look I'm a white person I that's good thing yeah like that has a terrible oh boy oh boy i got a big skin and that's a good thing you know it's like that's a terrible I feel like they've already been punished but the press the Scott pelees of the world and the Dean I don't even know how to pronounce named in BK or Beckett who runs the New York Times and that David muirs who treat Hillary Clinton like some kind of God Queen these liars these deceptive you know people who lie by omission and by Commission and just constantly are attacking the Republicans and praising the Democrats because they're all Democrats or something like seven percent of mainstream journalists or Republicans it's seven percent you know that's not by accident that doesn't happen by accident the Conservatives don't make good journalist they're great conservative journals they just can't get work they can't get work at CBS at NBC and ABC and when they do get work they can't get their stuff on and they have to leave you know I mean shall Atkinson who's not a conservative just a good investigative reporter had to leave CBS because they wouldn't let her bring they wouldn't let her run stories critical of Barack Obama so these people are so awful that the prospect of their horror and shocked if Donald Trump gets the elected at least gives me a little bit of pleasure but the only pleasure I'm going to get out of this and and I guess I do think that there's this infinitesimally at that Donald Trump will do what he says he will do and appoint conservative Supreme Court justices where I know Hillary Clinton is going to appoint a Supreme Court justice to overturn Heller your gun rights take away your gun rights take away your First Amendment rights I know she's going to do those things so I had this slight slight preference for Trump but he's also he's a terrible person and he and he will endanger the polity I mean I think the question is whether the Congress will restrict them and I think they're more likely to do that with Trump than with Clinton so just it what can I say it's it's election 2016 run for your life start paddling we're all going to be going to Cuba you know Billy Whittle always says you know you never see anybody paddling the trying to get to Cuba they're all trying to get out of you but I think after this election mhm all right let's talk about stuff I like you know this is Jason Bourne is not the stuff I like it's a it's a b-movie it's a good movie I said that there's not gonna be any spoilers and there's not but if you haven't seen there will be a spoiler about the Bourne Identity the first film I'm going to assume that you know who jason bourne is that he is a guy who lost his memory he found out he's a CIA assassin and he wants out he doesn't like the fact that he's a killer he's now a trained killer and he doesn't want to be that guy so the latest one is one of these shaky cam things that the what'swhat's green grass what's his first name Paul Greengrass yeah he you know his entire directorial thing is he shakes the camera and that's supposed to be active and you know you could get nauseous by the end of it you're like oh my god I can't watch it but it's got a lot of high-toned action couple of great chase scenes dump lot the thing about it is though is here let's take a look this is the from The Bourne Identity the firstborn film which was a great film directed by Doug Liman doug liman he did a great job and he's a really talented director green grass is this British leftist and he just i just don't like what he does and haven't liked any of the Bourne films since the first one which is one of my favorite films I bourne identity is one my favorite thrillers so this is the moment when born basically expresses his philosophy because he remembers who he is I don't want to do it anymore I don't think that's a decision you can make Jason Bourne is dead you hear me he drank two weeks ago you're gonna go tell him that Jason Bourne is dead you understand you gotta go go I swear to God if I even feel somebody behind me there is no measure to how fast and how hard i will bring this fight to your doorstep I'm on my own side now but when I saw this movie I thought this is a great movie it takes place in the 70s because the book is written I think it's published in nineteen eighty Robert Ludlum wonderful book by the way wonderful thriller it's published in nineteen eighty and it's about the 70s you know in the 70s we thought America didn't do assassinations you know that goes back way way there's a famous story about the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo I don't know if the story is true but it makes it into a lot of biographies about Wellington he's riding along the lines before the battle is joined and he comes upon a soldier taking aim at Napoleon he's going to assassinate Napoleon he's a sniper and he asks Wellington permission to fire in Wellington is absolutely enraged how is a terrible thing to do you know we don't assassinate people we let all these people die in order to fight the battle of waterloo and he doesn't want to end it with an assassination because it's just not the way the game is played you know and that has so changed that now we have Barack Obama killing people with drones assassinating people with drones and there was a lot of ancillary damage a lot of women and children getting killed when he does this but he is defending it we have Obama defending these drone strikes simply put these strikes have saved lives moreover America's actions are legal we were attacked on 911 within a week congress overwhelmingly authorized the use of force under domestic law and international law the United States is at war with al Qaeda the Taliban and their associated forces we are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first so there's Obama making the argument that the sniper makes two Wellington now Wellington says no no that's not the way the game is played we fight the battle that's this is a war we don't just kill the general if one once they start killing generals you know where does it stop so but now that's all gone here's Obama the hero of the left saying no we kill we assassinate people because otherwise these assassinations save lives their drone assassinations but that's what they are so after in the 70s after we found out that the CIA did do is fascinations three precedents in a row Ford Carter and Reagan passed laws saying no more assassinations I mean no more CIA assassinations whose we didn't do those things but now we do do from the president says yeah I'm blowing people away he said at one point I'm good at killing i turn it turns out I'm very good at killing people he bragged about it so now you've got this left-wing director who's got a problem because Tommy Lee Jones in this new Jason Bourne movie plays the evil CIA director and he says exactly what Obama just said you know to Jason point he says you saved lives by doing these things on top of which by the way we find out this is not a big reveal in the movie it's just a plot point we find out that Jason Bourne is responsible for one of our guys and our agents in Syria getting captured it because all born ever does is he exposes evil CIA plots and he exposes an evil CIA plot one of our agents in Syria gets captured and tortured so Jason Bourne in this movie's the bad guy you know I mean I just about halfway through the movie i stopped rooting for him i thought wait you got one of our agents captured in Syria I'm saying you know I'm supposed to think that's a good thing you know that you're the good guy and so it's very very confusing it started me thinking about the fact that there is a lot of art that is good and now this isn't you know I won't call this art this is entertainment but there is a lot of really high-level art that is good that puts forward bad ideals you know I mean some talented people I mean Eminem this is just to use a modern example very talented lyricist when you listen to him he's a very clever lyrics his stuff is evil you know he writes about the things he says about women it's just evil stuff but that doesn't mean talent is blind talent falls on anybody it does not care where it goes it's like the spirit you know it just falls on the people that it falls on some good people have talent some bad people at town and I've talked about you know I've been peddling this this book to you my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ which will be out in September you can pre-order it now yeah the great good thing but in it I talked about the fact that one of the things that led me to God was reading the Marquis de Sade is where we get the name sadism who was a brilliant philosopher and pornographer who wrote about how much fun it is to kill women to rape women to rape people boys kill every you know his stuff is evil but in rebut he makes the only solid argument for atheism I've ever read he makes the only argument with integrity for atheism I have ever read so when I read the Marquis de Sade I thought oh well that's atheism count me out exactly i'm so so that's that's part of what i want to say about the way we engage the stuff i like for today is a movie called Bonnie and Clyde so show here is the trailer from its day this is the old-fashioned trailer from Bonnie and Clyde they lured off on what might easily have been a wild romantic lark almost before they knew it with the giggles still in their ears they bloodied up for state please honey don't never leave me but knots and nothing Frank just figured on some easy pickings in your prank you know Texas Ranger you ain't hardly doing your job you ought to be home protecting the rights of poor folk not out chasing after us I know what do you want to do with him then I hang him uh-uh take his picture and then everybody's gonna see Captain Frank hammer of the Texas Rangers with the Barrow gang now you know we are just about bring these folks you would ever wanna meet so this is nineteen sixty seven directors Arthur pan one of the great directors and it's a brilliant and beautiful film but it takes these two thugs Bonnie and Clyde and they were thugs and it turns them into I mean it's faye dunaway and warren beatty's of the most beautiful human beings on earth and they're fun you could hear the narration you know it was just a lark they were so in love the giggles were still these were stone-cold killers these these people widowed and orphaned people in cold blood I think they killed nine police officers and the cop that who's in there this guy they call him Frank hammer I think his name was pronounced a mur I just read his biography there's a new biography called Texas Ranger I think we have an image yeah there it is and I just finished reading this and he was one of the great law men of the 20th century and he his wife sued the filmmakers and they had to pay her for slander because I used his real name like a fool he was never captured by Bonnie and Clyde he tracked them down relentlessly and he blew them away basically he was an old-fashioned Texas lawman I mean this was a guy who grew up in a white supremacist world he was a white supremacist himself in the sense that he thought blacks were inferior he risked his life 20 times against lynch mob sometimes thousand people strong to defend black people because that was his sense of justice even though you know I mean he liked black people he just thought they were inferior but that didn't stop him from risking his life sometimes single-handed like a wet like a sheriff in a western to stand up for people who were not and these and most of these black guys were criminals and they were guild but he was not going to let them lint be lynched so he was a great hero in this movie which is a beautiful movie it makes violence balletic and beautiful and poetic it makes these two thugs you know romantic and beautiful and it takes this great lawman and it's landers him basically I mean it basically makes him look like a fool and a buffoon which he simply wasn't and so the question then becomes what do you do with entertainment or great art that sells with values that are despicable and we're going to have to talk about this more tomorrow but let me just start by saying that art is an engagement it's something that you have to engage is not a passive thing you have to bring your values to the show and you have to be able to criticize art and think about art without coming across or even being without being stick in the mud without not enjoying what is beautiful about the art because there is something there's always something in great art that's true i found the truth in the Marquis de Sade even though it was not the truth that sod was selling and so that's what you you are part of the artistic process and have to bring those values to the to the processes so we'll talk more about it tomorrow I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew clava show the Clavin Week begins stay safe I'll see you tomorrow
