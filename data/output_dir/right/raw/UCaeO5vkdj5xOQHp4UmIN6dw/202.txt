had a motion<font color="#CCCCCC"> on their side well then</font>

142
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,740
Brett Kavanaugh went in there and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

143
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,770
some emotion of his own to show but

144
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,220
through her opening<font color="#CCCCCC"> statement and her</font>

145

interactions<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrat senators</font>

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit with her interactions</font>

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,270
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the with the prosecutor that was</font>

148
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,680
hired by Republicans although like I

149
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
said she didn't really focus at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

150
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,570
the actual subject but Christine Ford

151
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,970
she retold basically the same story we

152
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,710
already read in the Washington Post<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

153
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,419
little additional information was

<font color="#CCCCCC">provided</font>

155
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,720
she says she remembers<font color="#E5E5E5"> with 100%</font>

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Brett Kavanaugh assaulted</font>

157
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,410
her she also remembers and was given the

<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to repeat by Democrats they</font>

159
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,220
went back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this line several times</font>

160
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,670
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

remembers the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red Cavanaugh she</font>

167
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,640
remembers the stairwell and she says she

168
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,350
remembers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the house was sparsely</font>

169
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">furnished and those are really the only</font>

170
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,400
details that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she remembers Democrats</font>

171
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,720
kept going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the laughter they</font>

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's just it's an emotional</font>

175
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,380
Brett Kavanaugh<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in there laughing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not just the image of two guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laughing</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that disturbing image in your head</font>

183
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,440
but all of those details she remembers

184
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,820
and she remembers all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those details</font>

185
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,870
apparently with with absolute certainty

186

<font color="#E5E5E5">but the really important detail she</font>

doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're after her testimony a</font>

215
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,850
would use her name

216
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,530
Mitchell I think according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a map</font>

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had to somehow call somebody</font>

241
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,140
somehow she communicated with somebody

right after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happened and she got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

was she<font color="#CCCCCC"> like when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you picked her up</font>

253
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,000
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if she was perfectly normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,650
bubbly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy and everything was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine</font>

255
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,300
then it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> impossible to believe</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that she was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moments ago sexually</font>

260
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,610
was seriously wrong

261
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,110
well that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very compelling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence yet</font>

with two options<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay either one of</font>

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cabin our Ford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and summon very convincing but fake</font>

453
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,270
emotions on live television so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

454
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,770
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> death of liars and they're great</font>

455
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">great actors both of those things that's</font>

456
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">one option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

457
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,100
option is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one of the two of them is</font>

458
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,170
that or they're both telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

459
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,880
the truth as they see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now that's</font>

460
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,430
if the second option<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is is correct</font>

461
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Christine Ford is</font>

462
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,710
mistaken it means that or it could mean

463
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that she's embellishing slightly I mean</font>

464
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,690
there could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be some</font>

465
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,050
slight embellishments and so forth on

466
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,330
both ends<font color="#CCCCCC"> so Christine Ford could be a</font>

467
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bella Shing maybe Brett Kavanaugh could</font>

468
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,300
be I mean he kept being<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

469
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,650
cross-examined about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much beer he</font>

470
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,610
drank he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

471
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,170
downplay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but really who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cares how</font>

472
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,700
much beer you drank anyway so but that's

473
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's basically the option you have is</font>

474
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it either one of them is a totally line</font>

475
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,289
or they're both basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> recounting</font>

476
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,200
things as they remember it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Christine</font>

477
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,340
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> just remembers it incorrectly or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

478
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,629
has these years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later after having some</font>

479
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,039
kind of experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> with somebody she's</font>

480
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,859
now kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put Brett Kavanaugh face on</font>

481
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:59,099
the situation which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a possibility but</font>

482
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,960
if we're gonna go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

483
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,519
one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people is a liar which I'm</font>

484
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">not saying that I go with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that option</font>

485
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,909
but if you do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see how you can</font>

486
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,840
hang the liar label on the guy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

487
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,119
all of the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence and all of the</font>
