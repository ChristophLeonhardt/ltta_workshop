The U.S. government crushes one ton of illegal
ivory.
From 2011 to 2014, about 100,000 elephants
were poached, the most ever recorded.
China and the U.S. are the world’s largest
consumers of ivory.
In the early 20th century, the African elephant
population was 3 to 5 million.
Today it’s about 500,000.
