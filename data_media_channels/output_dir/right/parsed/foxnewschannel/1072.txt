STAFF MORE DIRECTLY SO THEY'LL
TRY TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO
ABOUT THE BLUE WAVE BETWEEN NOW
AND NOVEMBER, DANA.
>> Dana: THANKS, PETER.
LET'S BRING IN THE CHAIRMAN OF
THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSIONAL ECONOMY, STEVE
STIVERS.
YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO KEEP THE
HOUSE THIS FALL.
YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.
LET ME READ YOU A TWEET FROM AN
ELECTIONS GUY, G. ELLIOT MORRIS.
THEY SAID THEY MADE GAINS --
THEY MADE GAINS BETWEEN 6 AND
20% LAST NIGHT.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS
COMPETED TO VOTE TOTALS IN 2016.
HE SAYS PROJECTING TO NOVEMBER,
DEMOCRATS ARE AHEAD IN THREE OF
THE DISTRICTS, 49-25 AND 10.
I ONLY BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I
THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS AGREED
NOW THAT AT THIS POINT A WAVE
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT'S
POSSIBLE.
SO THE DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING TO
LOOK VERY SPECIFICALLY AT
CERTAIN RACES THAT THEY THINK
THEY CAN TARGET.
YOUR THOUGHTS.
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT, DANA.
GREAT TO BE ON.
YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE A BLUE WAVE.
MIGHT BE A BLUE DRIBBLE.
RIGHT NOW LAST NIGHT THREE
THINGS HAPPENED.
ONE IS WE GOT A REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR AND THAT
WILL HELP TURN OUT AMONG
REPUBLICANS.
TWO, AS WE TESTED OUR TURN OUT
MESSAGES AND THEY WORKED.
WE HAD MORE REPUBLICAN TURNOUT
IN EVERY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
EXCEPT ONE.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT.
FINALLY, THE GAS TAX THAT IS ON
THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER PROVED TO
BE A VERY POTENT SUBJECT IN A
RECALL VOTE IN ORANGE COUNTY AND
L.A. COUNTY YESTERDAY AGAINST
THE STATE SENATE
THE STATE SENATOR
THE STATE SENATOR,
THE STATE SENATOR, T
THE STATE SENATOR, THA
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT L
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOS
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOST
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOST H
THE STATE SENATOR, THAT LOST HIS
RECALL VOTE.
>> YEAH.
GAS IS UP TO $5 A GALLON.
>> $5.
>> Dana: THAT WILL MOTIVATE YOU
TO GET TO THE POLLS.
THE DCCC SAYS THE BLUE
CANDIDATES WENT THROUGH.
SO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN
STRATEGIC AND SMART ON THE WAY
TO THIS.
IS CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THAT,
YOU KNOW, ARE YOU GOING TO
CONTINUE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT OR
MOVE ON AND LOOK TO OTHER PLACES
LIKE COLORADO, NEW YORK AND I
ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT
MARTHA ROBEY, FORCED INTO A
RUN-OFF YESTERDAY.
>> YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE
TO FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA.
WE HAVE AN ENDURING PRESENCE
THERE.
WE HAVE AN OFFICE IN IRVINE.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT OUR CHANCES TO
HOLD THOSE SEATS AND I'LL
ANNOUNCE SOMETHING TODAY.
CONGRESSMAN PETE AGUILLAR, A
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT GOT LESS
VOTES THAN SEAN FLYNN IN HIS
RACE YESTERDAY.
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR
TARGET FOR US NOW.
IT'S NEW ON OUR LIST.
PETE AGUILLAR, YOU KNOW, SHOWED
HIS WEAKNESS IN FINISHING SECOND
AS A SITTING INCUMBENT.
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO MOVE TO WHERE THE
NEW PRIMARIES ARE AND WHERE THE
GENERAL ELECTIONS ARE MOVING
FORWARD THERE ARE SOME
COMPETITIVE RACES IN CALIFORNIA
THAT WE'RE GOING TO STAY FOCUSED
ON AND MAKE SURE OUR CANDIDATES
WIN.
OBVIOUSLY MARTHA ROBEY FINISHED
STRONG LAST NIGHT.
SHE GOT ABOVE 40%.
SHE DIDN'T GET TO 50.
SO NOW SHE HAS THE RUN-OFF
AGAINST THE FORMER DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN WHO CLAIMS HE'S A
REPUBLICAN.
IN THE RUN OFF, HE WILL HAVE A
HARD TIME EXPLAINING HIS VOTE
FOR NANCY PELOSI IN 2009.
>> Dana: IN THE LAST MINUTE I
HAVE FOR YOU.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TOUTING AND
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO.
345 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE
WOMEN RUNNING.
BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE FOCUSED
ON THIS AND YOU HAVE A GOOD
STORY TO TELL.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD.
>> THANKS, DANA.
WE HAVE MORE WOMEN CANDIDATES AT
ANY TIME FOR THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY IN SEATS WE CAN WIN.
LAST NIGHT WE HAD YOUNG KIM WIN
IN THE 39th.
SHE'S OUR NOMINEE.
WE HAD DIANE HARKEY WIN.
WE HAVE GREAT WOMEN LIKE MIMI
WALTERS, A DEPUTY CHAIR HERE AT
THE NRCC THAT GOT 55% OF THE
VOTE LAST NIGHT.
DID REALLY WELL.
SO WE'VE GOT LOTS OF GREAT NEW
WOMEN.
JUST LAST NIGHT CHRISTY NULLEM
HAS WON THE GONER OR THE YEAH
PRIMARY IN SOUTH DAKOTA.
WE HAVE GREAT WOMEN THAT ARE
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE GOING ON TO
DO OTHER THINGS AND WE HAVE
GREAT WOMEN CANDIDATES BEHIND
THEM AND SOME INCREDIBLE
RECRUITS LIKE LEAH PETERSON IN
ARIZONA, THAT WILL BE A GREAT
CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA, TOO.
AND MARIA SALAZAR IN FLORIDA.
>> Dana: WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO
NAME THEM BUT WE'LL KEEP AN EYE
ON THEM.
