126
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,910
used to go to the beach a lot with my

127
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,030
grandma yes Troy this year and she used

128
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect these big shells that very</font>

129
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,889
awesome have a tiny little hole at the

130
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,080
top because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I don't know what</font>

131
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,850
it's like either erosion<font color="#E5E5E5"> North like an</font>

132
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,650
animal has been like eaten from it or

133
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,090
something I don't know anyways they

134
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,950
naturally had little holes at the top

135
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,979
and she would<font color="#E5E5E5"> make strings out about and</font>

136
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,510
like to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on the wall so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we would</font>

137
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,620
like go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beach together and</font>

138
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,580
collect them but they were like a very

139
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,889
specific kind many other shells which

140
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,810
she was like ok these the ones were

141
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,160
looking for and we look at that salon

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,169

143
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,150
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> also apparently the dutch queen</font>

144
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,800
used to ride her horse on the beach and

145
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,539
my grandma<font color="#CCCCCC"> once meant to queens which is</font>

146
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,580
right here horse mostly my other

147
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,930
favorite just like beach activity is

148
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,789
walking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beach in autumn and</font>

149
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">winter so you like you're bundled up</font>

150
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,500
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cold but because the beach</font>

151
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,030
is pretty flat you can just like walk

152
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,340
across regions are really really nice

153
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,440
and so I like that way more than like

154
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,870
the beach and summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love the beach</font>

155
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,190
and sun but i also just really

156
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,479
appreciate it could reach walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

157
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,190
it's so cleansing i think i'm going over

158
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,690
to my channel before how light I feel

159
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,130
like the way to read teach you how to

160
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,930
breathe and they teach<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how to slow</font>

161
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,510
down and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can learn a lot from them</font>

162
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,610
and like that basically hippie<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll</font>

163
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,099
ever get in my life<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah I plan it</font>

164
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,660
really soothing so it's very common to

165
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,580
like walk alongside as well I'm not just

166
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,620
to sit in my mother as well electricity

167
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">too but I've actually never been on many</font>

168
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,460
beach holidays because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're we live</font>

169
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,990
close to the beach so let me go we go to

170
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,970
like lakes or we go to the countryside

171
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,310
because that's the stuff we don't really

172
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,770
get you again much up yeah I'm time

173
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,009
seeing what my my favor

174
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,509
each memories where I feel like there's

175
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,759
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many to really name but one of</font>

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,889
my favorite times was I mean a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

177
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,599
grand how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I think about that is</font>

178
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,729
very developed and very like touristy

179
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:36,969
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I remember going to a little</font>

180
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,710
restaurant that was right<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the beach</font>

181
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,289
it was right<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one of these huge huge</font>

182
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,439
resort hotels but it was completely like

183
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">made out of essentially corrugated</font>

184
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,270
cardboard and corrugated metal and they

185
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,800
start the most amazing feature sobczak

186
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
when I saw eight fish and it was

187
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,449
brilliant fresh fish<font color="#E5E5E5"> was delicious and</font>

188
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,620
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could just go right into the</font>

189
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">water we walk down the beach and they</font>

190
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,610
were setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little sea turtles free</font>

191
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,529
and we help them better use the water

192
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:03,909
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure like the ones that like</font>

193
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:06,729
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite make it we went back in</font>

194
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,409
and guided them in and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

195
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,839
the version eat them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment look</font>

196
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,610

197
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many fun memories but I love the</font>

198
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,139
ocean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did a banana boat ride once no I</font>

199
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,589
urbanovsky my I don't know see

200
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,869

201
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:25,839
little bit of like kayaking and snowball

202
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,879
grease on swimming jumped some ways yeah

210
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,979
think there's one big thing which is

211
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,139
restaurants on the beach not on the

212
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,319
beach side on the beach so my time has

213
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,990
dunes which cover thee which sort of

214
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,809
like you've got the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> rope houses</font>

215
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,009
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got the street then you've</font>

216
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,930
got pavement and you've got dunes which

217
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,789
is essex and that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like below</font>

218
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,189
sea level so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know good as necessary</font>

219
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:08,139
they made the dunes higher in my town

220
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,800
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of meters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

221
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,509
you can't always see the ocean if you're

222
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">walking on the pavement but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then this</font>
