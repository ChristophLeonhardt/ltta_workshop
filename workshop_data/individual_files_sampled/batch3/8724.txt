GROWING TO ABOUT EIGHT MILES. IT'S SINCE BEEN CONTAINED. LELAND: FOUR STATES HOLDING PRIMARY ELECTIONS THIS TUESDAY. WE'LL GET TO PENNSYLVANIA IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES. MEANTIME, LET'S TALK ABOUT IDAHO. THE GOVERNOR'S RACE THERE ACTUALLY ONE TO WATCH. HISTORICALLY IDAHO HAS BEEN A RED STATE. ONE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE BELIEVES THERE IS A CHANCE TO CHANGE THAT. PAULETTE JORDAN JOINS US NOW FROM BOISE. NICE TO HAVE YOU WITH US, MA'AM, WE APPRECIATE IT. THANKS FOR HAVING ME, LELAND. LELAND: WHEN WE SAY HISTORICALLY, WE MEAN THERE HASN'T BEEN A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR SINCE 1990. PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONGRESS WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN THAT. GIVE US A SENSE, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE A CHANCE NOW? WELL, WE'RE SEEING A NEW TIME, A NEW AGE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE EXCITED THAN EVER TO SEE A BOLD NEW KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT WE OFFER IN MY CANDIDACY AND I FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE. WE FIGHT TOGETHER FOR OUR IDAHO. LELAND: DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT IN THAT IDEA OF A POSSIBLE BLUE WAVE COMING. YOU'RE NOT REALLY RUNNING THOUGH AS A CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT. EVEN A MODERATE DEMOCRAT. YOU CALL YOURSELF A PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT. THIS IS A STATE THAT BROKE HARD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. HASN'T VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN SINCE OR A DEMOCRAT SINCE LYNDON JOHNSON FOR PRESIDENT. IS SOMETHING CHANGING IN IDAHO OR YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS NOW? PEOPLE ARE MORE THAN ABOUT THEIR PARTY. THEY'RE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF VALUE SYSTEM WHOLLY CONNECTED TO THE LAND AND PEOPLE ARE READY FOR TRUST, THEY'RE READY FOR INTEGRITY AND THEY WANT REAL LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE IN MY CAMPAIGN AND CANDIDACY. LELAND: POLICY-WISE, WHAT'S WRONG IN IDAHO IN YOUR MIND THAT NEEDS FIXING? WELL, FROM EDUCATION TO OUR HEALTH CARE, WE HAVE AN EXPANDED ACCESS TO 62,000 INDIVIDUALS IN OUR STATES. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. WE ARE FACING DILAPIDATED SCHOOLS, WE ARE DEFUNDING OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION, NOT SUPPORTING OUR TEACHERS WHO ARE NOW GOING TO OTHER STATES, OUR NEIGHBORING STATES LIKE WASHINGTON AND IDAHO EXCUSE ME, OREGON, WE HAVE TO DO BETTER AND WE HAVE TO PROVIDE NEW LEADERSHIP THAT WILL DEFEND THE PEOPLE AND PUBLIC LANDS. LELAND: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LAND, YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, ON THOSE LANDS FOR CENTURIES. HOW MUCH OF THE ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE TO DO WITH NATIVE AMERICAN ISSUES? WELL, IT'S CLEARLY STATED THAT WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO IDAHO, WHEN YOU COME TO OUR COMMUNITIES, ALL THE ISSUES, WHETHER IT'S DEALING WITH OUR PUBLIC LANDS, FIGHTING FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT, FOR CLEAN AIR AND WATER, FIGHTING FOR EDUCATION, FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE, THOSE ARE NOT JUST INDIGENOUS ISSUES. THEY'RE ISSUES FOR EVERY SINGLE IDAHOAN. LELAND: HOW MUCH SUPPORT WERE YOU GETTING NATIONALLY, ESPECIALLY FROM THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS? DO THEY THINK THIS EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO BE MUCH LESS WINNABLE, BUT A FAIR FIGHT WITH WHOEVER WINS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION? I THINK ONCE WE WIN ON MAY 15TH, WE'LL SEE THEM COME TOGETHER. AND THOSE LIBERTARIAN, UNAFFILIATED AND WE'LL SEE THE SUPPORT AT PLAY AS WE SPEAK SO THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATION WILL CERTAINLY BE THERE. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE NATIONAL LEVEL WILL BE THERE FOR SUPPORT. LELAND: I'LL TAKE THAT TO BE THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE YET? OH, WELL, YES, I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING THIS RACE CLOSELY. LELAND: SO YOU'RE ENDORSED BY CHER, THAT'S SOMETHING WE HEAR AT LEAST ON TWITTER. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US, MA'AM. THANK YOU, GOOD LUCK, AND COME BACK AND TALK TO US IF YOU WIN
