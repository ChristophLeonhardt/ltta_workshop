let's talk about the Internet the Internet is a dreary garbage strewn wasteland populated by barely sentient trolls and zombies the Internet is a portal into the darkest foul lists most disgusting recesses of the human soul the Internet is I'm convinced a blight on mankind the Internet is certainly a net negative for the human race there are some positive aspects to it but the positive aspects are so vastly outweighed by the negative that it's almost embarrassing to bring up the positives at this point it's embarrassing to look at all of the destruction this thing is rocked on mankind and to say well yeah but it helps me stay in touch with my friends and family and yes I say this as a person on the Internet who uses the internet to make a living I'm using this internet the Internet to send this message that is anti Internet and I am a person who makes a living on the Internet I understand all that okay I understand the irony you may even call me a hypocrite maybe I am a hypocrite I hope I'm not I'm not trying to be that's not my point here but if that's the accusation you want to lob against me you're free to do that what I've tried to do personally is is I have tried to take this thing this awful monstrous thing and use it to speak some truth because I I noticed that although there's quite a lot being said on the internet and shouted back and forth does not appear to be a lot of truth a lot of real truth anyway there's there are a lot of people who are out there saying I'm speaking truth I don't care what anyone thinks I'm just gonna tell it like it is there are a lot of people on the internet who have that brand but what I notice and what I noticed before I started doing this is that the vast majority of them are actually just saying they're all they're doing is pandering what they're saying is a careful calculation because they know that there's going to be a wide audience of people that line up to Pat them on the back for saying this supposedly controversial thing and so I noticed that and I said well maybe I should get on here and try to say some things that that that perhaps most people actually will not say that's been my mission and what I feel called to do and I hope that I've had some success in that regard that's up to you to decide but what I can say is that it's and so I'm not I'm not going anywhere even though I'm saying all this I still feel as low as long as God has given me this platform in platforms platforms go away everything nothing lasts on the internet especially platforms somebody can have an audience in a platform one day in the next day it's gone everything just goes away like that and if and when that happens to me I'm not gonna cry about it I won't weep over it it's God's will but right now it seems that it's God's will that I have this platform and I use it to say things and so that's what I'm doing but it is hard to make any kind of a lasting impression to say anything meaningful on the Internet is hard becomes and it's becoming harder and harder and harder because there are billions of people all shouting into the same void and even to have an audience online these days is no longer any kind of novelty it's it's not a big deal when I first started doing this five years ago or so it seemed like there was a relatively small community of what whatever we are whatever we were I don't know internet personalities whatever you want to call there was a small community it seemed like of people who had any kind of real platform and audience now though only five six years later it's like everybody has an online audience everybody has a brand there's not a big deal anymore it's not novel and it seems everyday I'm scrolling through Facebook and I come across some new random dude or woman shouting into a webcam and saying things that are meaningless and pointless and Hollow regurgitating talking points taking these rehashed regurgitated microwaved talking points and feeding them to the audience some more because it would seem like there are quite a lot of people on the internet who have an insatiable appetite for talking points even if they've heard those exact talking points a million times they want to hear they want to they want to hear them a million more times and so it seems every day there's another person who becomes an internet sensation by saying the same thing that everybody else is saying and so I'll see some new random guy you know you know because I'm curious and so I look at their Facebook page and I'll see that oh they have oh this person has a million and a half followers and I think what that guy really a million and a half people what he warrants a million in that and a half people listening to him and I'm sure many people have had the same thought about me I realized that so these content creators and that's and that's really what people who make a living on the Internet what we're call we are content creators and that's really an apt name because for most of us that's all we're interested in doing it's not necessarily saying anything that means anything we're not worried about not worried about substance not worried about quality not worried about being meaningful but simply we're worrying about pushing out content it's just stuff for you to click here click this click this click this here's some more stuff to click click this thing click this thing click this thing watch this thing okay stop watching that watch this watch this watch this watch that look at this look at this look at this look at that that's what content creators are doing for the most part it doesn't matter what the thing is anything if I can get you to click on anything I don't care what it is just click on it it's like imagine if you were at 7-eleven or something and you went to the refrigerated section where all the bottles bottled drinks are and you saw saw a bottle some nondescript bottle and with some weird substance inside some off-colored off colored substance and on the label it just said content okay whoever made this bottle of whatever it is they don't even care what's in the bottle it's just it's stuff it's it's a substance it is content it is filled with something now here drink it now of course you would never pick up that bottle and drink it but on the internet you do it all the time on the internet all the time you are consuming content simply because in his content and the content creators then are quite happy that the average American spends 25 hours a week online in addition to his 35 hours a week of TV so that's 60 hours a week all told and that's a low estimate 25 hours a week online under you're thinking the same thing that I thought when I saw that statistic that sounds pretty low but remember this is average for all Americans so 25 hours a week that number is is brought down considerably by the 65 and over crowd who's certainly are on the internet now more than they would have been even five years ago but the grand grandparents and great-grandparents are bringing that average down I think if we would look at average time spent on the internet for people between the ages of 13 and say 45 or 50 that numbers gonna go way up but on average we're talking 35 hours a week watching TV 25 hours a week online that's 60 hours staring at screens every almost every waking moment now as human beings we spend staring at screens and that is not even though I need you to stare at screens so that I can make a living and feed my family I am telling you stop doing it stop living your life this way it helps me okay that's to my advantage so that there's there is no I could have no ulterior motive and telling you stop doing it but I'm telling you to stop doing it because it's destroying you it's destroying all of us this is not a life okay this is not a human existence a life spent doing this with your phone just okay this is this is what life has become just this you this is your whole life but for a lot of people your whole life is just this just that at this and this motion and that's all that's life but that's not life that's not a life that's not a human life the human life is lived outside in three dimensions interacting with people and with things and with nature and that's what life is supposed to be and we know for teenagers it's even worse what kind of people what kind of people are we raising teenagers statistically at this point basically never look up from their phones we're talking nine to ten hours a day ten hours a day on average teenagers are spending consuming media ten hours a day again I say that is not a human existence we all have the same stories and so this is a familiar complaint but it's an important complaint and one that we need to deal with and we're not and that is you know if you're ever around and this everyone is like this nowadays but teenagers if four teenagers it's even worse because this has been their life since they were babies and they've literally been raised on the internet and at this point I think it's almost like a physical dependency has has been formed but we've all been around teenagers and and they I wrote this forget what I wrote a few months ago but I relayed this story from last year when my family we went to a family reunion on my wife's side of the family in Minnesota we're at a lake house and so multiple generations of the family all at this lake house and there's a jet ski and there's fishing and there's it's it's great right and I'm having a blast I'm with my brother-in-law we're fishing we're all taking turns on the jet ski we're going on the pond to we're having a great time I put my phone away I had it off for probably four or five days I didn't even look at it it was I loved it I just loved not it I took vacation day so I didn't have to and I was completely out of the loop I was oblivious and I was loving but the younger generation there at the family reunion the teenagers the 10 the really 10 to 20 crowd they don't look up from their phone you entire time we could be out on the pontoon they're looking at their phone we could be playing cards at night they're looking at their phone they're looking at their phone they do not look up from ever you again I say this is not this is not human this is really bad guys it really is I know everyone complains about it like I said but this is really bad I don't even think we understand yet we cannot even comprehend the consequences of raising a generation like this it truly is unlike anything that the world has ever seen yeah every generation has their new technology every you know every era of our should say every era of human society has some new technological advancement and yeah there are always people who are concerned about what that technological advancement will do but this is different this is life being condensed down to this and you know one other thing about that when we talk anytime somebody starts wringing their hands over the internet you're always gonna have the people who say yeah but you know people did that with cars everyone worried that cars we're gonna destroy society everyone worried that TVs would destroy society everyone would worried that phones would destroy society and society turned out fine didn't it and every time I hear that I always think did society turn out fine are you so sure that those people issuing those prophetic warnings about cars and TVs and everything were they really wrong I don't think they were totally wrong now I'm not saying that it that I you know we should all give up our cars or that necessarily the world would be better without cars but actually even something like the automobile has had a has had some positive effects but it has had some very serious detrimental effects to society that some people early on saw and and knew that was going to happen and they warned us and their warnings actually came true and yet here we are looking at them and say see how wrong they were they weren't wrong they were right there were people with cars who for instance warned that okay now that we have cars we the ability to go anywhere we want what you're gonna find is that the family's gonna break apart people are gonna spread far apart they're gonna spread far away from their families they're gonna spread far away from their jobs children are gonna leave their parents and be far away it's gonna lead to the breakdown of the family their even people that warned it with cars you know people aren't gonna be going to church as often because now the kids are gonna be get in the cars and going off and doing something else rather than going to church these were the things people warning about and it did actually happen so with the internet and of course there are people with the TV who warned the TVs gonna take over our life it's gonna it is going to undermine the family and now the entire fam the existence of the family is going to be centered around the TV there were people warning about that in the 30s 40s and 50s and they were right that is what happened I don't know about 30s when did it when was a TV event I don't know so with the internet I think there are a lot of warnings being issued that hour that are correct that are right and this is to say nothing of all the of all the porn you know I've talked about all the things problems with point with with the Internet probably the biggest problem is that it has turned us into a race of people who are completely obsessed with pornography and don't give me that well there used to be Playboy magazine okay yeah there was Playboy magazine and even that is pretty recent but you didn't have billions of people across the world who were spending hours and hours and hours of their week reading Playboy magazine you do have that with the Internet to be precise and this is just on one website pornhub porn hub they released their statistics at the end of every year how long how much time do people spend watching videos on just their platform and right now we're at the point where on average humanity spends four-and-a-half billion hours watching porn on just that site that's 500,000 years worth of porn in one year that means that over the next decade humanity will spend five million years collectively watching porn and a sizable portion of that audience will be children that wasn't happening with Playboy magazine the Playboy under your dad's mattress which is the stereotype people weren't spending four billion hours looking at Playboy it's different and it has had effect on us studies show Americans between the porn and everything else we do online Americans our memory has suffered our attention spans have suffered we can't remember anything we can't pay attention to anything we need constant stimulation we can't stay focused on one thing at a time we can't interact with other human beings our written language has deteriorated and you can see that you can see how our our language is kind of plummeted back into the Stone Age and now we're using hieroglyphics again but we call them emojis and you have all these people can't communicate can't convey an emotion through the written language without using a smiley face or a frowny face me happy me sad look at smiley face that's what you have college educated literate supposedly intelligent people who cannot communicate happiness sadness whatever through sentences so they have to use pictures I truly believe that your life would be so much better if you cut out the internet or at least you cut down on it drastically drastically and I think you would become a much happier more fulfilled more serious more intelligent person you you would lose nothing I would lose something if you cut down on the internet I would lose your clicks your traffic your attention and the money that comes with it but I'm willing to lose that if it means that more and more people are starting to live human lives again and then you free up time once you start taking once you start reclaiming your life and detaching yourself from the phone and from the internet from TV then you free up time to do other things like to play with your kids or read books or do anything else III don't know train for a marathon become a beekeeper learn how to learn how to garden learn I just anything pick a subject and become an expert in it and not because you googled it you look at Wikipedia or you watch the YouTube video but become a real expert just pick a subject whether it's a historical subject or or anything it's a scientific subject literature history or art you know any any subject at all pick a subject and become an expert say to yourself I'm gonna read 15 books on this subject over the next year and I'm gonna know it why not that's how we become interesting people that's how we become interesting substantive people when we know things and we have real interests Facebook is not an interest YouTube is not an interest you it's where we go when we have no interests so what would you be missing if you cut your 25 hours a week down to say 5 or 1 5 hours I think is a good why not that let's let's do 5 hours a week that's one hour a day Monday through Friday which is still kind of a lot but and then no hours on the weekend so you you have your weekend entirely free of that and I think that's great that's moderation that would be fantastic there'll be a great start wouldn't but I think this process of reclaiming our lives from the internet it's you have to do it one piece at a time I think if you want to break a habit you got to break it into pieces first and then you can break the habit and so let's let's focus on I think if we're gonna work on this together let's focus on it one piece at a time so let's start here you got to start somewhere what a waste you what do we just start with this start with the morning take the internet out of your morning no I don't know about you but I have and I I wrote about this a few weeks ago and since then I've been trying to correct it not totally successfully but I in the past had developed a very bad habit and I know that statistically this is what most people do at least between the ages of 18 and 44 most people are just like me in this regard the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is I look at my phone I have my alarm which is on my phone so I pick up my phone turn off the alarm well actually I hit snooze on the alarm and then put it back and then I hit snooze again and put it back then I hit snooze again and now finally when I'm ready you actually get up now but I don't just put the phone down because now I have the phone in my hand and so I it's very easy to just turn off the alarm and then just click on one more thing and now here I am in cyberspace and that's how I start my day on the Internet at least up until recently first thing I do is I look at my email I look at my personal emails and I see all the spam and the junk and all the stuff but I look at my work email and then for me I look at my public emails which are emails from readers and fans and people who hate me and all that and and so that's great for some reason I've felt the need to begin my day looking at that kind of stuff and which means invariably there's gonna be at least one message overnight that'll say you know something like Matt you're a piece of garbage and I hope you die and then okay great I'm glad that I could start I'm glad that I read that and I know that about and so now I can start my day that little little little dose of self-loathing to start the day it's great but then the next thing I do is I'd scan the headlines then I would check social media and as this whole process starting the day and all of that would take about five minutes you know how it is with the internet it's even though it's even though I'm checking five or six different things do it in five minutes a nice concentrated little shot of anxiety and vitriol to start the day with and I I think it's just toxic it is a it is a toxic awful way to begin your day so if we're going to cut down drastically on our internet and media usage I think maybe we begin here because consider also most people they check their phone first thing in the morning like I do they also that their phones the last thing they're looking at at night before they go to bed and there are even I read apparently there are people who are so addicted to the Internet that their brain wakes them up in the middle of the night so they can check social media so there are people who they check the there they're checking the phone before they go to bed they're waking up to check it and then they go back to sleep and they wake up three hours later and then they check their phone again and then they go downstairs for breakfast and they're on their phone again and they never put down their phone so what if we all pledged it's a it's a modest way to begin here with our end goal of detaching ourselves from the internet and not being dependent on it what do we begin by making a pledge and we say to ourselves we're not going to look at our phones in bed that's it maggot barring an emergency and somebody calls and there's been some terrible thing that happened overnight or whatever barring emergency we are not going to look at our phones in bed period not gonna look you and even though it's only a comparatively small amount of your day that you spend in bed before going to sleep and after waking up it's still think about you free up that time you sever it from the internet and what can you do with that time now there's this nice little chunk of them it's an important time too because it's the time right at the beginning the day and right at the end and so this decides how do you start and how do you end so it's important time it's precious time what are you gonna do at that time now you're free it's like oh I'm free I don't worry about Facebook or Twitter what are you gonna do at that time you could read a devotional you could read the Bible you could pray it's anything you could do anything you know another thing you could do with that time you could do and this is great and I think we've lost this in modern societies maybe one of the worst things about the Internet is that we've lost this we've lost the ability to do nothing what if you took that extra time and you did nothing with it nothing you have simply silence and stillness and nothing and maybe you lay there and you look at the ceiling and you think you form thoughts you contemplate that's how we become real thinking substantive people is when we have time to think and I think this is we know that the Internet has intruded on our social lives and changed the way that we interact it's changed kind of our exterior lives in a big way and mostly in a harmful way but even worse than that is that the Internet has taken over our interior lives in that we don't think anymore because any extra time that we have where there's nothing going on you're waiting in line your whatever I was at I was I was in a waiting room recently I don't forget what I think it was as I said the dentist in the waiting room and there was a bunch of people all sitting around and of course every single one myself included we were all just staring at our phone because the idea of sitting there for 30 minutes and maybe talking to the person next to you or saying nothing and just sitting there we can't even conceive anymore of the idea of simply sitting somewhere and doing nothing but that's up until the internet and phones came along that was a very common thing for human beings you had you had plenty of moments like that where you were sitting and not really doing anything those are important moments because that's when you live within yourself and we need to have that but we've lost that now people think the Internet does our thinking for us the internet literally completes our sentences for us and now we can instead of forming a full thought we can follow a half-formed thought train of thought all across the Internet and people we know over sharing online rather than having thoughts they keep inside themselves thoughts that they otherwise would have kept inside themselves and should have kept inside themselves now we can spill it all out on the Internet get it out there you so maybe you do that with your time just a suggestion think this could be a good place to begin so maybe we can make that pledge together and I think we'll all be happier for it I get a few less of your clicks and your views maybe because that's the time you spend when you read something that I wrote or you watch a video of mine that's fine I'll make that sacrifice because I think it's better for you it's better for all of us well thanks for watching thanks for listening to this on the Internet Godspeed everybody you
