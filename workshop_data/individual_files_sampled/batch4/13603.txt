this guy Meek Mill was supposed to visit the White House to take part in a panel that was to include I I guess vice president Mike Pence and Jared Kushner I and Van Jones who is obviously very much in left now bringing people who are right and left black and white to talk about these issues which is what they should do if they're going to discuss these issues well Meek Mill was supposed to go and then he bailed he bailed because according to TMZ jay-z called him up and convinced him otherwise so according to bossip.com never heard of him they said that reports a release that Meek agreed to travel to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to discuss prison reform because Trump is currently hosting a prison reform summit participants in attendance are said to include members of Congress various activists and people who become victims of the system but it looks like me isn't gonna make it to the event and it's all due to words of wisdom from hob I guess hob is jay-z is that is that okay mm-hmm okay TMZ reports that jay-z called the Philadelphia native on Thursday night and made his stance clear meaning with Trump would be nothing but problematic for both his image and the cause he's fighting for apparently other high-profile celebs and friends also called meek and voiced serious concerns about his attendance meek listened to the advice from his peers and decided not to attend after all okay so here's the problem for eight years everybody in the black lives matter movement is suggesting the law enforcement system is biased and that criminal justice reform had to be pursued and now Donald Trump's gonna do that and you're not gonna go meet with him because to meet with him and be undermined the cause how is it undermining the cause no Democratic House of Representatives let's say the Democrats win the election in 2018 let's say that they win back the house they probably won't win back the Senate you think criminal justice reform is gonna get done when Nancy Pelosi is the head not a shot because she's gonna put a bunch of deal killers in that bill it's not going to happen the only way criminal justice reform gets done with Trump as president is right now with a bunch of Republicans in the House and a bunch of Republicans in the Senate and President Trump in the White House if you want a deal you need to talk to the guy who's capable of making the deal it is that simple but jay-z doesn't want the image of a bunch of black people meeting with Trump because it might make Trump seem not as racist to the press that's really what this is about so meek gave a statement to TMZ he said I was originally scheduled to be part of the panel on prison reform at the White House to help shed light on the issues within the system unfortunately the focus turned to the president and myself which concerned me that it might take away from creating a positive result from today's discussions well no the whole point here was that President Trump wanted to meet with leaders in the black community left and right said they could have a broad ranging discussion and hopefully come to some sort of consensus on the issue there's nobody to come to consensus on the issue if you won't attend the meeting and what do you expect Trump to do at that point I'm frankly I'm confused by this but this is why the entire Kanye West saga of the last few weeks actually matters because when Kanye West said listen I'm not gonna listen to you guys if I feel like meeting with Trump on the Trump if I feel like wearing the Maggie hadle where I'm Agra hat and everybody on the Left went nuts and people inside the rap community went crazy right in Kanye o is tweeting out all of the various Suites he was receiving and texts he was receiving from people like John Legend and Kanye to his credit said listen I'll say what I want that's exactly what mill make sure to send here what he should have said is listen this is too important an issue for me to let partisanship get in the way it's too important an issue for me to solve I don't like stuff that Trump has said so I'm not gonna pretend that I think the Trump has been great on racial issues but if I can get a win here why wouldn't I go and help my fellow black folks who apparently are very much ensconced in this fight for criminal justice reform instead Meeks said I decided not to attend that the focus would be solely on fixing our prison system most importantly I remain fully committed to improving our criminal justice system but I'm going to insult the President of the United States by pulling out of the deal because jay-z told me to now when partisanship Trump's even the best interest that you are apparently trying to pursue I would suggest that you have allowed your partisanship to blind you to the actual facts on the ground and and that really is too bad
