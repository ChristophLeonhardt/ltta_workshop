Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and absolutely devastated Island I'm gonna give you the stats on that in a second and what Donald Trump is saying about it now but he's always been flippant about it and you remember of course that he didn't go down there for a long time didn't sell and send relief for a long time even today the relief is not nearly at the levels that that locals and our generals on the ground say are necessary and he would say weird preposterous things here let's go to video 6 tomorrow this is what he said about Puerto Rico this is an island surrounded by water big water ocean water ok all right and remember II got in trouble for flippantly throwing paper towels like he was shooting baskets at the victims of the hurricane but he defended that by saying this they had these beautiful soft towels very good towels they were faithful towels incredibly ordinary people to house in plastic wrapping how would he but everything has to be dramatic there are beautiful soft towels beautiful it guys a super weirdo man all right anyway now back to the devastation in Puerto Rico and his reaction they said nearly three weeks after the hurricane hit not him CNN is reporting this three weeks after the hurricane hit 83 percent of Puerto Rico is without power according to Puerto Rican government and much of the 3.4 million person Island is without clean water and the death toll has jumped to 45 with at least a hundred and thirteen people unaccounted for so that is devastating eighty-three percent without power now they're saying it might take up to a year to regain power in Puerto Rico completely so now that's a long term project so what is Donald Trump's response to that he says let's put up tweet here accountability say the governor electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes conkers to decide how much to spend we cannot keep fema the military and the first responders who have been amazing the most difficult circumstances in Puerto Rico forever wait you're gonna pull him out oh my god he's gonna pull him out so it's been less than three weeks and he's saying what guys I mean what do you want me to do keep helping you you remember he said before when you just help yourselves oh my god okay so let's be fair now you know he talks about budgets and then Obama had too much deficits maybe this is how he treats everyone you know even if you were in a state that voted for him or a state that's mainly white maybe he says hey you know what Texas Florida let's wrap it up okay you've had your three weeks you've had more than three weeks let's get out of it so we went back and found out what he actually did say he said this about Texas Texas we're with you today we're with you tomorrow and we'll be with you every single day after to restore recover and rebuild now all of a sudden though were Toriko rebuild I don't think we have there you mean what he was down there he said you're throwing our budget out of whack I mean I got to do a little bit of rescue but rebuild I mean I'm already stayed there almost three weeks what do you want from me I mean it was a week late so maybe two weeks but still but Texas you voted for me or red state and you're mainly white taxes we will always be with you every single day how about Florida Florida just like Texas these are Suites we are with you today we are with you tomorrow we will be with you every single day after to restore recover and rebuild but you lazy Puerto Ricans down there you're on your own it's oh look there's a couple of different reasons for this one is I don't think he still understands that Puerto Ricans are part of our Americans in our part of America when you get into the fact that they're not a state but they're Americans well that'll you need no border we go is that complicated so that's one two is states that voted for man didn't three is a mayor San Juan and it dare to insult them look and it's probably the she wasn't insulting at all she was saying is please send help we're dying we're dying police I know and he's like ah that does not look good for me hence I will punish you but I think the most important one is honestly racism and you can disagree with them that's okay and if you think of all the first two that's fine but you see what the results are so it's not as important as the actual results but I and I don't think that will Trump recognizes that he's arrests so of course not he thinks is when they asked him about he said what I'm from New York I know a lot of Puerto Ricans okay so but in his mind they don't deserve the help but good people of Texas of Florida they deserve the help they're good honest people and my god what could they do a hurricane hit in Puerto Rico they were mess already he said that - he said oh well they already had debt they already had problems so remember these old quotes such poor leadership ability of mayors of San Juan and others in Puerto Rico who are not able to get their workers to help they want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort 10,000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job they want everything done for them they can't help themselves those are not coincident those words are not coincidental they're the oldest stereotypes there is about racial minorities and I don't think he wrote it down thinking aha show those let's be kind to say Latinos right no he just doesn't know that's what he thinks he's like later reporter Eakins of course they never helped themselves so now he's like you want me to spend more of my money or money on you people now we got to get out by the way when you ask FEMA officials they say no recovery takes months and sometimes years he didn't listen to his advisors of course of course he didn't listen to his advisors there wasn't anybody he just has certain assumptions and he works based off those assumptions let's hope to god that the rest of the government does not have to actually follow through on his stupid tweets banning the people of Puerto Rico now would be deeply in her inhumane unamerican and unacceptable if you like this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network dot-com /join
