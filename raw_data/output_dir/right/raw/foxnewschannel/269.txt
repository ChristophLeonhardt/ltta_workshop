FROM TALLAHASSEE.

00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:07,616
THANK YOU.

4
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:08,718
>> Sandra: JOINING IS NOW,

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:09,218
MARCO RUBIO.

6
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:11,020
SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR CALLING

7
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:11,520
IN THIS MORNING.

8
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:12,955
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT WHAT

9
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:16,192
YOU ARE SEEING?

10
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:19,228
WE JUST FINALLY BEGAN TO GET A

11
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:20,162
LOOK AT THE ACTUAL DAMAGE AND

12
00:00:20,163 --> 00:00:22,998
DESTRUCTION TO YOUR STATE.

13
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,468
>> I LIVE THROUGH HURRICANE

14
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,236
ANDREW, MULTIPLE HURRICANES, BUT

15
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:29,405
ANDREW WAS THE ONE THAT'S MOST

16
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:30,639
STRUCK ME.

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,609
AFTER THE STORM, THE OFFICIAL

18
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,612
REPORTS, IT'S NOT TOO BAD, AND

19
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,914
SUDDENLY, THEY WERE LIKE OH, MY

20
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:39,382
GOODNESS.

21
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:40,649
IT'S STILL EARLY.

22
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,618
THAT'S THE KIND OF NEWS THAT I

23
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,754
AM GETTING FROM PEOPLE ON THE

24
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:45,321
GROUND.

25
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:48,190
WE DODGED THE BULLET, BUT THE

26
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,992
SUN HAS COME UP.

27
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:53,229
PEOPLE STARTED TO SEE IT.

28
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,330
PANAMA CITY, THE ELECTRIC GRID

29
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,898
IS UNJUST OR DAMAGED, IT

30
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:56,799
STRUTTED.

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,335
SO IT WILL HAVE TO BE REBUILT,

32
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:00,002
NOT JUST RESTORED.

33
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,937
SOMEBODY TOLD ME POINT BLANK,

34
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,606
TALK TO THEM LAST NIGHT, THEY

35
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:06,142
SAID OF MEXICO BEACH IT'S GONE.

36
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:09,412
THE CHARMING OLD FLORIDA TOWN.

37
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:11,046
I THINK THE BIGGEST FEAR HERE OF

38
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:13,349
COURSE, THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

39
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,083
INCREDIBLE CHALLENGE FOR MONTHS

40
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:14,650
TO COME.

41
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:16,118
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING

42
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,287
TO HAVE TO STEP UP AND REALLY BE

43
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:18,654
HELPFUL.

44
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:20,523
THIS IS THE KIND OF EVENTS THAT

45
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:21,991
COULD CHANGE THE CHARACTERISTIC

46
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:22,458
OF A COMMUNITY.

47
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,027
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE IT AND TAKE

48
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:26,295
A DECADE TO RECOVER IF IT'S NOT

49
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,964
DONE APPROPRIATELY.

50
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,466
SO I THINK THIS JUST TURNED OUT

51
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,535
TO BE AS BAD AS WE THOUGHT IT

52
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:33,836
WAS GOING TO BE.

53
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:34,870
POTENTIALLY WORSE.

54
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:36,305
WE WILL LEARN MORE THROUGHOUT

55
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:37,807
THE DAY, BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR

56
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:38,574
SURE IS THERE ARE A LOT OF LIVES

57
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:42,244
THAT HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED, AND IT

58
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:44,480
IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

59
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:44,814
REBUILD.

60
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:46,215
I'M HEADED TO THE FEMA

61
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:47,750
HEADQUARTERS IN A FEW MINUTES.

62
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,118
I WILL BE HEADED TO NORTHWEST

63
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,786
FLORIDA.

64
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:52,621
OBVIOUSLY, I HOPE MY EARLY

65
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:53,956
ASSESSMENT IS WRONG.

66
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:54,757
I FEAR I'M NOT.

67
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:55,991
>> Sandra: WE ARE LOOKING AT

68
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:56,392
THIS VIDEO.

69
00:01:56,393 --> 00:02:01,564
IT IS JUST AWFUL.

70
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,400
ABOUT DOWNED WIRES AND TREES

71
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,668
CAUSING ALL LOTS OF THREATS, STI

72
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:06,235
CAUSING ALL LOTS OF THREATS, STL

73
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:07,937
POSING AS TO THOSE IN THE AREA.

74
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,772
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR?

75
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:12,842
WHAT DOES YOUR STATE NEEDS IN

76
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:13,642
TERMS OF FEDERAL RESOURCES?

77
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:14,410
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S GOING TO

78
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:17,012
NEED A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.

79
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,414
I'VE BEEN UPDATING PEOPLE ON

80
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:19,615
TWITTER ABOUT SORT OF THE

81
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:22,184
FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT ARE ON

82
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:22,918
STANDBY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

83
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,186
DEFENSE READY TO OFFER AND SO

84
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:24,487
FORTH.

85
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:27,623
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE STILL ON THE

86
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,058
SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION

87
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:29,425
MISSIONS.

88
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:30,960
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A

89
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:34,196
LOT OF EFFORTS DEPLOYED.

90
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,764
THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST,

91
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:38,534
AND IS ON THE HARD WORK BEGINS.

92
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:39,568
RESTORING POWER APPEARED WITHOUT

93
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,504
POWER, YOU HAVE NO CELL PHONE

94
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:45,374
POWERS, NO ABILITY TO SUSTAIN

95
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:49,812
LIFE.

96
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,146
THE MINUTE YOU TURN THE POWER

97
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:53,349
ON, YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE, YOU

98
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,216
COULD START A FIRE.

99
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,985
ALL SORTS OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

100
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:57,786
IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED THING

101
00:02:57,787 --> 00:02:58,554
THAT LIES AHEAD.

102
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,422
IT IS NOT JUST THE HURRICANE,

103
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:01,991
BUT THE WATER DAMAGE.

104
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:03,826
THE HOMES LOOK INTACT, ABOUT THE

105
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,027
WATER DAMAGE IS GOING TO FORCE

106
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,796
AT HOME TO BE DEMOLISHED.

107
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:09,899
I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO

108
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,633
NEED HIS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

109
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:13,269
FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE, AND WE

110
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,003
ARE GOING TO HAVE A MASSIVE

111
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:16,438
HOUSING PROBLEM HERE.

112
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,975
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SHELTER

113
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:20,743
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FOR EXTENDED

114
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:21,510
PERIODS OF TIME WITH WHO WILL

115
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:24,079
NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR

116
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,981
HOMES.

117
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:27,983
BECAUSE OF DOWNED POWER LINES,

118
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:29,018
OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE ROAD.

119
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,252
SO THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS

120
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,087
GOING TO BE SORT OF WHERE DO WE

121
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:32,855
HOUSE PEOPLE?

122
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:34,156
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NO PLACE

123
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:36,191
TO LIVE HERE FOR THE FORESEEABLE

124
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:37,226
FUTURE.

125
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:38,260
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I'M

126
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,062
GOING TO PRESS ON WHEN I GO TO

127
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,497
FEMA HERE IN A FEW MINUTES WHEN

128
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:44,466
WE ARE DONE WITH THAT BRIEFING.

129
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,168
>> Sandra: OBVIOUSLY, THE

130
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:48,037
IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC TOLL WILL BE

131
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:50,773
THE HEADLINE IN ADDITION TO THE

132
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:51,473
LOSS OF LIFE THAT HAS ALREADY

133
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,776
BEEN EXPERIENCED.

134
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,878
THEN CONSIDERING THAT TOURIST

135
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,912
DESTINATION THAT SO MANY OF

136
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:58,047
THESE CITIES AND TOWNS IN

137
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:59,481
FLORIDA ARE, THE LONG TERMS

138
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,750
AFFECT I'M SURE WILL BE A

139
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,318
LONG-TERM EFFECT.

140
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,619
I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHILE WE HAVE

141
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,388
YOU ABOUT THIS.

142
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,290
ABOUT THE STILL MISSING SAUDI

143
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,794
JOURNALIST.

144
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:12,928
OBVIOUSLY, WAS A BIG CRITIC OF

145
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:13,529
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

146
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,601
THIS IS A BIG HEADLINE.

147
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,400
CONGRESS IS STEPPING IN.

148
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,036
THEY ARE TAKING THE LEAD ON

149
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:21,336
THIS.

150
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,105
YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE

151
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,139
COMMITTEE.

152
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,008
WHAT'S ARE YOU ASKING FOR?

153
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:26,775
WHAT DOES YOUR COMMITTEE WANT TO

154
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,577
KNOW?

155
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:31,580
>> WE HAVE TRICKLED AN ENTIRE

156
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:32,681
INVESTIGATION.

157
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:37,519
THIS IS GOING TO GO BEYOND

158
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,122
SANCTIONS.

159
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:42,224
OBVIOUSLY, I AM PRIVY TO SOME

160
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,459
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH I

161
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:43,892
CANNOT SHARE.

162
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:45,361
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

163
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:47,096
I AM NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS

164
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:49,098
WHAT HAPPENED, BUT WE WILL LEARN

165
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:49,565
IT SOON ENOUGH.

166
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:52,601
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT DEMANDED A

167
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:54,370
GUIDE TO BE OBJECTIVE, THEY SENT

168
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:56,038
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE INTO KILL HIM

169
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,873
AND CHOP THEM UP, IF THAT IS

170
00:04:57,874 --> 00:04:59,208
WHAT HAPPENED, I AM TELLING YOU

171
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,410
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IS

172
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:03,212
A COMPLETE REVOLT AGAINST OUR

173
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:04,079
POLICIES WITH SAUDI ARABIA.

174
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,780
IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY

175
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,417
ARE AN IMPORTANT PARTNER IN

176
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:10,152
MIDDLE EASTERN STRATEGY TO

177
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,588
CONTAIN SORT OF IRAN'S NEFARIOUS

178
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,622
ACTIVITIES IN THE REGION.

179
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:16,425
BUT IF THEY HAVE GONE SO FAR AS

180
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:18,827
TO KILL THIS GUY, CUT THE BODY

181
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:20,529
UP, AND SEND A CREW HERE TO DO

182
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,630
THAT, IF THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE

183
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:22,898
FOR THAT, AND I'M NOT SAYING

184
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,134
THEY ARE, WE ARE GOING TO FIND

185
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,602
OUT WHEN THE EVIDENCE IS

186
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:26,969
PRESENTED.

187
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,970
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED,

188
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,638
THEN I AM TELLING YOU WHAT IS

189
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,773
GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IS GOING TO

190
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:33,509
BE IN AN EFFORT TO COMPLETELY

191
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,411
FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED THE

192
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,012
RELATIONSHIP.

193
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:38,414
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS

194
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:39,581
AWARE OF THAT TOO.

195
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:40,849
I HOPE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

196
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,552
I HOPE THIS GENTLEMAN IS ALIVE,

197
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:44,787
BUT I FEAR THAT THIS THING IS

198
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:47,189
GOING TO TAKE A NEGATIVE TURN

199
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,956
HERE PRETTY QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY

200
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,391
IF ANY OF THE STUFF THAT IS OUT

201
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:53,162
HERE TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE.

202
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:53,996
>> Sandra: JAMAAL KHASHOGGI IS

203
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:54,697
THE NAME OF THE JOURNALIST.

204
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:57,966
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING INTO

205
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:58,801
THIS FURTHER.

206
00:05:58,802 --> 00:05:59,768
ANY IDEA WHAT WOULD HAVE

207
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,004
INSPIRED AND ACT LIKE YOU ARE

208
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:04,973
SUGGESTING?

209
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,975
>> I AM SPECULATING, BUT

210
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:08,343
GOVERNMENTS THINK THAT THEY CAN

211
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:09,478
GET AWAY WITH SILENCING CRITICS

212
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,448
BY ELIMINATING THEM, THEY HAVE

213
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:13,082
BEEN DOING SO RECENTLY.

214
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,284
YOU HAVE SEEN THAT IN CHINA FOR

215
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,019
EXAMPLE, THEY ARRESTED THE HEAD

216
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,023
OF INTERVAL.

217
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,825
KILLED PEOPLE, OPPONENTS OF

218
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:23,959
VLADIMIR PUTIN WANDA PRETTY MUCH

219
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,796
ROUTINELY DYING, FALLING OUT OF

220
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:28,163
WINDOWS.

221
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,032
A MYSTERIOUS HEART ATTACKS, OR

222
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:31,834
JUST FLAT OUT POISON.

223
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:33,068
OBVIOUSLY SAW WHAT NORTH KOREA

224
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,003
DID TO HIS OWN BROTHER BECAUSE

225
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,138
HE WAS RUNNING LOOSE.

226
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,906
SO IF THIS IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED

227
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:40,209
HERE, IT WOULD BE IN LINE WITH

228
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,077
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AUTHORITARIAN

229
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:43,145
GOVERNMENTS DO AROUND THE WORLD.

230
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,214
I JUST HOPE FOR KHASHOGGI SAKE,

231
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:49,651
FOR HIS FIANCEE, THAT THERE

232
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,787
IS GOING TO BE A COMPLETE AND

233
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:53,355
TOTAL REVOLT ON CAPITOL HILL,

234
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,691
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, ABOUT

235
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,760
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAUDI

236
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:58,160
GOVERNMENT.

237
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,195
IT'S AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP,

238
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:02,264
BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW FOR THAT TO

239
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:03,098
SILENCE US IN THE FACE OF

240
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,033
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF THAT IS

241
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,235
WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

242
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:06,869
>> Sandra: SENATOR MARCO

243
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,704
RUBIO, THANKS FOR CALLING IN

244
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:09,605
THIS MORNING.

245
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:11,607
HOPEFULLY HE CAN KEEP US UPDATED

246
00:07:11,608 --> 00:00:00,000
ON THIS AND THE OTHER STATE THAT
