1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,630
“In my worldview, food

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,790
certainly plays a role,
hopefully in bringing

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,280
some kind of enlightenment
and understanding

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,860
and openness and appreciation
of other cultures.”

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,650
Anthony Bourdain became one
of the most famous chefs

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,340
probably living today,
partly — in fact mostly —

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,730
because of his writing
and his reporting

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,510
much more than because of his food.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,040
“Work, work, work, work, work.”

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920
And I think one
of the defining

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,980
images of Tony Bourdain
that will live on

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,070
is of him cracking
President Obama up

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,260
in a noodle shop in Vietnam.

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,619
“This is killer.”

15
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,330
They’re both
so happy to be there.

16
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,670
And you can tell that.

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,730
And that was just not an image
of a president eating street food

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,280
that we had
ever seen before.

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,380
And Bourdain, when he
was cooking, his food

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,980
was classic,
pretty upscale.

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,000
When he went over to broadcasting,

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,620
he abandoned that
world completely.

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,440
He really was not interested
in what rich people were eating

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,877
in fancy dining rooms.

25
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,350
He was really
interested in what

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,772
people were cooking all
over the world, making

27
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:03,150
the best of what they had.

28
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,780
And he definitely connected
both of those traditions

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,930
in a way that I don’t think
anyone had ever done before.

30
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,920
He really saw himself once
he was a writer as someone

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,870
whose job it was to poke
the aristocracy

32
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,360
in a very classic way.

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,580
“I loathe in
principle the idea

34
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,730
of adhering to any orthodoxy
or strict belief system,

35
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,610
because my travels
have shown me

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,370
as I move from place to place
that what I thought yesterday

37
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,160
is, in fact, completely
wrong, again and again.”

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,380
His first TV show,
“A Cook’s Tour,”

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,530
was focused exclusively on food.

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,670
“I think almost all modern
chefs are impressed

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,320
by Japanese presentation —”

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,020
His more recent show that
he was filming when he died

43
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,436
is called “Parts Unknown.”

44
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:45,720
It’s more of a travel show.

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,440
There is a food aspect to it.

46
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,790
But his mission — as he saw
it — was to really give people

47
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,390
access to places
like Lagos, in Nigeria,

48
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,720
or the night markets
of Singapore.

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,652
Places that were, as he
thought of them, off the map.

50
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:02,040
He brought them onto the map.

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,640
“So back in Vietnam
and all of the things

52
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
I need for happiness:

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,210
Low plastic stool — check.

54
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,200
Tiny little plastic table — check.

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,850
Ooh, something
delicious in a bowl.”

56
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,490
Bourdain was really smart.

57
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,080
He was really brash.

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,690
His appeal
definitely was partly

59
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,170
to men, who may previously
not have thought of cooking

60
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,970
as such a masculine activity.

61
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,030
He was
irretrievably masculine.

62
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,950
“Because that’s
the kind of guy I am.”

63
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,620
Bourdain’s mother was a copy editor
at The New York Times

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,670
and he was always
part of — in fact

65
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,630
one of the first — of the
new generation of more

66
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,820
educated chefs who
knew a lot about food

67
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,070
and were good at
talking about food.

68
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,680
He had written, I believe,
a couple of mystery novels

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,950
before he published the
article in the New Yorker

70
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,330
that really made
him famous.

71
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,200
That formed the basis of
“Kitchen Confidential,”

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,210
which was his memoir
of what it’s really

73
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,530
like to work in a kitchen —

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,390
“Welcome to 
my world.”

75
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,950
— which was full
of what some people consider

76
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,700
really unappetizing details,
but which were totally

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,190
entrancing for people
who were caught up

78
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,270
in the idea of this rough
and tumble, no holds barred,

79
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,490
the idea that
working in a kitchen

80
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,250
was like being in a rock
band and it was sweaty

81
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,890
and it was loud and
it was stressful.

82
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,350
But in some way
it made people —

83
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,650
it brought people together.

84
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,330
It made them better. It pulled
their best work out of them.

85
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,860
It was very intense the
way that he described it.

86
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,430
“You know, I wrote a book that,
you know, I stand by

87
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,440
and that it was an honest
representation of what I saw,

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,061
what I went through,
what I, you know —

89
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:38,950
the voices I heard

90
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,800
and my own
voice at the time.

91
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,455
But I provide a validation for
a kind of a meathead mentality,

92
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:47,695
a bro, you know, sort of
meathead, bro culture

93
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:51,900
that, you know, has not been
good, particularly for women.”

94
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,260
Bourdain always called himself

95
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,220
a classic bored
New Jersey suburbs kid.

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,450
He really tried to escape
that as soon as he could,

97
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,740
first through music
and then through drug use.

98
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,710
Lots of chefs, especially
back in the ’80s,

99
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,290
used cocaine really simply
as a way to stay awake

100
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,670
during 12-hour shifts.

101
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,530
It was something that
he was open about.

102
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,390
It was something that
he struggled with.

103
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,190
I know that he
quit multiple times

104
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,019
and relapsed multiple times.

105
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,399
In some ways, that was always

106
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,980
in the background of
his persona as a chef

107
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,630
and it was also
in the background

108
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,390
of his persona
as an individual,

109
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,710
as someone who had
been through the fire

110
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,300
and survived.

111
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,440
“I went from a guy, you know,
broke, always been, had been

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,350
broke, never insured, never
owned anything, perpetually

113
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,180
in debt,

114
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,860
hardworking guy to overnight,
the guy with the

115
00:04:38,860 --> 00:00:00,000
best job in the world.”
