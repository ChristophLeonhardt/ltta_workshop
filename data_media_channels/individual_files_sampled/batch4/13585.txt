Donald Trump's economic adviser Gary Cohen has resigned bringing the number of Trump advisors who have resigned to all of them speaking in an empty White House where his voice echoed up and down the deserted hallways the president said that there would be no problem replacing Cohn and the other advisors because all the best people are still applying for White House jobs so far Trump says he has interviewed such candidates as Bette Midler Harry luyendyk from The Bachelor the evil clown from it and Jim Acosta unfortunately the evil clown told reporters he refuses to work with Acosta he says it's one thing to entice children into sewers with balloons but what Acosta does is disgusting a cost to responded by issuing a statement saying quote look at me I'm Jim Acosta look look I'm Jim Acosta look at me unquote meanwhile the guy from The Bachelor had no comment although Trump did return from the interview carrying a rose until the advisors were replaced Trump says he will simply sit at a long table by himself and move from chair to chair giving himself advice and different voices in a demonstration Trump sat at the head of the table and announced he would soon be raising tariffs on steel then moved to another chair and said I resign trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right it's mailbag day you've been clinging on by your fingernails

over and do it now yesterday we were talking about that moment when a narrative starts to take hold of you emotionally right like you're watching a TV show and somebody dies on it and suddenly you're crying over a person who doesn't exist and this works whether it's fiction or nonfiction so the news media creates the sense of terror and emergency and chaos and suddenly you find yourself all excited and energized just as if you were watching a TV show but the question is is what they're talking about does what they're talking about exist and the reason they do this with Republicans they did it to george w bush everything he said everything he did was a a scandal the reason they do it is because ultimately in every single presidency there is going to be a crisis there is going to be a mistake there may even be a scandal this is true in every presidency and so when that happens they want you to feel like oh my goodness this is the straw that broke the camel's back because if it's Barack Obama they just don't cover the scandals and then when there is a scandal something goes wrong they say wow he's been doing such a good job it's a little glitch in the in the machinery with Trump and with George W Bush when when finally they make a mistake even if it's just a cosmetic mistake like Bush made when he didn't go and visit New Orleans right away after Katrina even if it's just a cosmetic mistake they suddenly say look it's all true everything we've been saying up till now was true here's the proof here is the final proof so yesterday Gary cone resigned and this is a big resignation the guy has been he's a Democrat he has fought with Trump openly about things like his charlottesville comment he made to give a big interview about how he disagreed strongly with that but he has also been he's been a avid free trader he pushed the tax cut he has been a big regulation cutter which as you know is one of my pet peeves regulations I think it's great that he did this and there's speculation and this is speculation but there's speculation that because Trump started talking about tariffs obviously Cohn was on the side of no tariffs of free trade there's an there other guys in the white house who were in favor of tariffs and protectionism and there's speculation that that is why Kohn left so he's an important guy and it's again you know you don't like to see the president get isolated with only people who share his opinions you want people arguing with them you want them to hear different sides because Trump doesn't listen he does hears things so the narrative the important narrative is that this is a Minh other resignation in so many resignations morning Joe put out this this montage of all the the people resolve their announcements of all the people resigning this is cup 13 Michael Fleeman has resigned the White House communications director Mike dub Key has resigned press secretary Sean Spicer resigning Reince Priebus is out White House communications director Anthony scare Moochie resigned the senior administration official is confirming that Bannon will be leaving Keith Schiller will be departing the White House health secretary Tom Price resigns the deputy national security adviser is now leaving Rob Porter is resigning White House communications director hope Hicks has resigned the president's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn has officially resigned so but the bigger narrative here of course is that the White House is imploding the White House in chaos if you type White House imploding if you google that all these stories come up you know but they but the thing is they've been going on since Trump came into office so we put together this is a montage we put together this is over the course of Trump's presidency this cuts 16 of people basically selling you this narrative of chaos at the White House because it's been a chaotic week in the White House even by trumpian standards I have never seen such chaos I have never seen such infighting a White House that keeping them honest just about any way you look at it is a picture of turbulence turmoil and yes chaos what's the split on fear and loathing and how do they now recruit folks to fill some of these jobs it's a great question I think fear and loathing are heading down the track toward a photo finish unglued that is Donald Trump's car addition we're not even through the first year and it's there's just so much chaos and so much disruption President Trump is at his Florida resort after a week of extraordinary turbulence that seems to signify a deepening crisis than some of the previous rocky weeks in this White House what matters in all of this madness is chaos in the White House is is bad for the United States and bad for the world so it's bad for everybody chaos chaos chaos everybody's resigning everybody's walking out and obviously Trump is a chaotic guy so I'm not going to sell you any line I mean these narratives always work when there's an element of truth in it Trump tweets out the new fake news narrative is that there's chaos in the White House wrong people will always come and go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision I still have some people that I want to change always seeking professional protection there's no chaos only great energy and then he came out yesterday and he said this this is cut number two the White House has tremendous energy has tremendous spirit it is a great place to be working many many people want every single job you know I read where oh gee maybe people don't want to work for Trump but believe me everybody wants to work in the White House they all want a piece of that Oval Office they want a piece of the West Wing and not only in terms of it looks great on their resume it's just a great place to work it's got tremendous energy it's tough I like conflict I like having two people with different points of view and I certainly have that and then I make a decision but I like watching it I like seeing it and I think it's the best way to go I like different points of view so everybody wants to work at the White House he says here just for a dissenting opinion here is a economics professor from the University of Chicago Austan Goolsbee asked if he would like to take Cohn's place well hey because the focus of the administration to my mind has been not where it should be and now this slapping of tariffs threatens potentially to lead to an escalating trade war if not an outright global recession so that'd be category a but category B there's chaos on the personnel side in the White House and you see that not just on the economic team you've seen in communications on the political side on foreign policy and the chief of staff role now on the economic team unprecedented turnover of personnel and I think that's a sign that it's not a healthy environment so you know there's there's a certain amount of truth to this in most presidencies after two years people start bailing you know if Saint Francis were president president st. Francis people would still bail after two years it's just that I pressure that tough it's that harder job Trump is no Saint Francis I mean obvi he says it himself he likes conflict he likes a little chaos he likes things going on like that if you're a nice high-pressure job and you're a normal human being or even a very high functioning human being after about a year you start to think like me I don't think so you know I'm out here I've done my job but you know there have been about 19 major people who resigned but I want you to listen to some of the people who resigned just so you actually get a real sense of it Preet Bharara he is the guy the US Attorney for the Southern District who's basically defied Trump and Trump got rid of him Sally Yates also Attorney General said she wouldn't enforce some of trumps anti-immigration things she was fired Michael Flynn he was the guy who got caught on that phone call Pratt Pence was angry at him and that he lied about it or didn't didn't come clean about it very unclear exactly what Flynn did wrong he was on James Comey fired obviously a guy who was not doing what Trump wanted him to do you know some of these people are just people who didn't get along Anthony scour Moochie bad hire Wright came in there this and and certainly Steve Bannon as they adjusted what the my point about this is this Trump is a neophyte he comes in he's never been a politician before gonna make more mistakes than other presidents in in terms of hiring in terms of you know yeah hi you bring in Steve Bannon and Steve Bannon is doing a good job in the campaign and suddenly you think you know Steve Bannon doesn't know what he's doing he proved that with Roy what's his name down and one more thank you we proved that with Roy more supporting he didn't really know what he was doing so Trump caught on to that he got rid of him so you're seeing a little bit of this obviously there's also stuff that's not so good Rob Porter was badly handled the guy who was accused of beating his wife that should have been caught earlier on it's a shame to lose hope Hicks it's somebody that's somebody who you know really was attached at the at the you knows like his right arm and it's ashamed to lose her but some of this is being overplayed because of the fact that he's a neophyte who is in opposition to the Washington establishment so you've got the real chaos that is part of his managing style and his personality but also you've got a little extra cast from the fact that he's just coming in here you know that he's coming in as an opposition guy you know is these guys opposed to the way things usually run he's learning the ropes so is a little bit half-and-half on there also one of your letters when I asked you what would make cause you to abandon Trump one of your letters said I can't remember unfortunately the name of the person who wrote this in but one of the letters was that the very fact that Trump is unpredictable is a bad thing the president should be predictable I get that I understand that you certainly want the President to that you his word to be good the problem with Trump is he is a constant constant negotiator and in a negotiation it is an understood thing that everybody's not telling the truth right so you're not really lying because everybody understands when I say this is my last offer everybody understands that I'm taking a shot I'm bluffing it's like it's like playing poker you're playing poker nobody says oh you said you had a great hand and I turn over your cards and you don't have anything you're a liar and a sneak you know you were bluffing it's part of the game and Trump plays everything like that he plays everything like that so some of his statements not being true some of the statements and dialing the back are part of a negotiation technique it's not politics as usual it's tough to deal with in a world where your word really matters I can think of ways in which it's beneficial like with North Korea the guy you know Trump had a wonderful joke the other day where he said you know negotiating with North Korea people say you shouldn't negotiate with a crazy man and he said but that's his problem not mine and I think that's what he's selling to Kim jong-un in North Korea I'm not spell do you really want to mess with me I got a great big red button I got a big nuclear arsenal and I am out of my freakin mind do you want to negotiate do you want to push it with me and the other day North Korea said oh yes we'd love you know it's been my father to get rid of our nuclear weapon say anything my father's dream I get rid of nuclear so they say yes we will negotiate and Trump was asked what changed this this is great this is Trump as I love him okay this is a cuddler font - what do you owe this recent openness to talk me nobody got that but I think they're sincere also because the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea including you know the great help that we've been given from China and they can do more but I think they've done more than certainly they've ever done for our country before so China has been a big help I think that's been a factor but these sanctions have been very very strong and very biting and we don't want that to happen so I really believe they are sincere I hope this sincere we're gonna soon find out I don't believe this sincere at all I don't believe he believes they're sincere at all I believe that's also just kind of negotiating technique but I love that line where they said what change he said me and and also so he said as he says everything in that New York deadpan where the which is the way New Yorkers make jokes when they say something outrageous and they just keep a deadpan face and it's like absolute silence in the press room like everything he says has to be deadly serious so again I think that the narrative of chaos is based on a truth Trump likes Kass it's his managing style it makes it much harder to work very very difficult environment but really really to me the question when Gary cone resign was not so much oh is this is everything imploding is the White House going down the drain it's kind of a normal day for Trump the real question is did he leave over this tariff thing and how bad are these tariffs are here that economic professor say a worldwide recession is on the way now I love economic professors but economic anima s' never get anything right every single month the numbers come out and they say unexpectedly unexpectedly they're this unexpectedly there's you think like well if you don't expect it every month maybe you know you should change is change your theories somewhere along no no we don't want to do that our theories work perfectly it's reality that is out of whack all right yeah our next episode of the conversation by the way is coming up on Tuesday March 13th it'll be a 5:30 p.m. Eastern 2:30 p.m. Pacific and it features ben shapiro who many of

conversation so let's just talk about this taro thing now I the reason I don't talk about these things is I'm not an economist you know you listen to the experts the experts frequently get it wrong I do strongly suspect that the panic and craziness is panic and craziness I mean Trump has this thing about trade deficits would I think we actually have a cut about this yeah talking about trade imbalances cut number four and he said this this is something he has been saying for as long as I remember I mean decades when I was with President Xi and China as an example we lose five hundred billion dollars a year on trade we have a deficit of approximately five hundred billion dollars a year with China and we're doing things with China which are very strong but they understand it but I was with him and I said to him in public I said look I'm not blaming you I blame our people for not doing a better job for allowing this to happen but it's like that with many countries other than smaller the European Union has been particularly tough on the United States they make it almost impossible for us to do business with them and yet they send their cars and everything else back into the United States and they can do whatever they'd like but if they do that then we put a big tax of 25% on their cars and believe me they won't be doing it very long the European Union has not treated us well and it's been a very very unfair trade situation I'm here to protect and one of the reasons I was elected as I'm protecting our workers I'm protecting our companies not just using basic logic about trade you can see how things go right and you can see how things go wrong if I spend a thousand dollars for a stereo that stereo is worth more to me than a thousand dollars people always say that's it's worth a thousand dollars but that's not right the point is I would rather have the stereo than the thousand dollars or I wouldn't spend the money right it is also worth more it's worth less than a thousand dollars to the guy who's selling it he estimates how much work how much materials he put into it and he says oh it's about you know nine hundred and fifty bucks so I'm gonna make you know an extra fifty bucks here so he's making a profit and I'm essentially making a profit because the stereo is worth more to me you can't measure exactly what it's worth to me but it's worth it that the music were that the tone whatever it is but I'm looking for is worth more than a thousand bucks or I wouldn't give them the money that doesn't hold up when you're talking about things like you that you like food if you're you know you need food and you're starving and only one person has the food he can charge you whatever he wants and basically he's gouging you you can say well it's obviously it's worth more than all the money you have but he's still gouging you so this is what Trump is talking about he's talking about steel which of course we need we make most of our steel but he's also talking about these guys who screw around with us and this is what Paul Ryan came out and said you've got to be surgical about these things you can retaliate against people who are actually hurting you but you can't just go out there and say yes everybody is now gonna pay this tariffs on steel here's Paul Ryan talking what sounds to me like common sense there is clearly abuse occurring clearly there is over capacity dumping and transshipping of steel and aluminium by some countries particularly China but I think the smarter way to go is to make it more surgical and more targeted so I think 232 is a little too broad and I think it's more prone to retaliation and so what we're encouraging the administration to do is to focus on what is clearly a legitimate problem and to be more surgical in its approach so we can go after the true abusers without creating any kind of unintended consequences or collateral damage the interesting thing about this is a steel guy an American steel guy who obviously supports I mean I mean one of my problems with these tariffs is they're kind of like a tax on me to support the steel industry because I'm gonna be paying for these tariffs when they you know whenever you buy something made of steel when you buy a car the car is gonna cost more that money is essentially given to the steel industry that's not that doesn't seem fair to me but here's this guy Burke buyer who even though he says yes I need this I need this - in order to compete he also wants Canada and Mexico who deal who don't who are dealing fairly he says he wants them to be carved out his cut number 12 the fortunate thing about the situation is the president has the ability in his power to carve out countries or products and and we're we're strongly in support that he hopefully evaluates all sides of the situation and he's able to appraise our talented and valuable allies like Canada and Mexico because to the gentleman from Nova spoink there are very valuable trading partners with us so again here it is the news media selling you chaos world recession end of the economy everything is terrible you know in all of this stuff there's cents to be made when you're listening to Paul Ryan he's talking sense when you're looking at Trump negotiating Trump is frequently talking more sense than even he sounds like because he has that brash style and he go he's goes in guns blazing and he always says the most that the you know the most extreme thing that he can say in every negotiating session and this is a negotiating session he is basically saying to these guys hey you know straighten up and fly right or we're gonna nail you and you want to get in a trade war I'm ready I'm ready for a trade war so he have the press point it's a trade war and he's saying I don't care all of that is nonsense all of that is narrative it's just a negotiation that's going on and we'll see you know I think I don't not sure the Trump knows what he's talking about when it comes to this when it comes to the trade deficit it seems wrong to me to worry about a trade deficit when you could have a trade surplus you know we've had trading surpluses with countries that we're doing terribly I mean if Turkey is cheating us and we straighten them out are we gonna you know do we want to be like Turkey are we saying gee I wish we could be more like Turkey I don't think so you know the country actually is doing quite well economically except for our government spending so my only point about this is as this news comes in all the time be cool be cool don't let them tell you the story think through the story that's all I'm saying it's like think through the story if when when you're watching a mystery story I remember this there's this one that's a trial story where there's a guy who is looks like the good guy and a guy who looks like the bad guy and the good guy turns out to be the bad guy now you say that's not real that's not like real life I'm not gonna be surprised by that because that wouldn't actually happen in real life well this is the same thing is the chaos really happening yeah but it's a managing stop are we going down the drain because of tariffs no that's negotiation these are things that you can disagree with you can have different points of view on but don't let them sell you this chaos and panic because that is a technique they're using because a Republican is in office a Republican they especially dislike all right we got the mailbag coming up but I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube bye you should be at the day I don't you know we're casting you out into the exterior darkness where there's great weeping and gnashing of teeth for a lousy $9.99 a month you don't have to have the weeping or the gnashing of teeth although feel free to weep and gnash your teeth if you want come on over to the Daily wire calm you can hear the rest of the show all right the mailbag that was good that was fast they say that was your trigger finger is getting better back there from Jacob hello sir Clavin how should one go about arguing for same-sex marriage on the grounds of freedom but against incest with a secular argument and taking out the argument that could be harmful to a child from an incestuous marriage well first and with one hand tied behind my back while standing on my head first of all you can't make any moral argument there is no there are no secular moral arguments there's no secular moral arguments you can prove this to yourself with a little handy-dandy experiment go in and try and make a secular argument to yourself and then after each argument you make ask yourself why that why or why you should care so if you say well it's for the good of society say why should I care about the good of society why shouldn't I care about my own good if they say well it'll make you happy well somebody else could say no if an incestuous marriage would make me happy there are only moral arguments I mean we talked about this last week about the fact that the very word morality in the sense that we understand it only came into use in the 16th and 17th centuries that word didn't exist in classical Greece and Athens they used the word ethics and and it was translated as Morales in Latin but it wasn't morality as we understand it you cannot make an argument that's an argument without God and by the way by the way since I feel that what is behind this question is a challenge to my sense that like gay marriage I just that I don't get all excited about it my point about gay marriage listen marriage as we as we understand it is an invention of the urge to protect women that's why it was invented to protect women and to basically organize society into a family so that you that that there's becomes a building block of freedom if a family is a self-governing unit you don't have to bring the government in to govern it we know that the left hates the family because they want the government to come in and govern everybody's life okay fine and my my opinion is that that was the definition of marriage for two thousand years two thousand years the definition of marriage was a man and a woman having children more than two thousand years I mean accepted of the fact that there was you know more you could marry more than one woman in a lot of places that was the definition of marriage just because you declare that gay people can get married doesn't mean it's marriage by that definition my point about marriage is marriage stop being marriage when you invented no-fault divorce that was Reagan by the way back in in California invented no-fault divorce my point is if heterosexuals destroy marriage by having no-fault divorce don't blame gay people don't blame gay people that they're saying well if you can redefine a marriage so you can have a divorce without any consequences we want to play we want to play that game you know that's that's my only point about that it's not that oh yes this is the this is not changing the entire definition of marriage it is so anyway the point about incest is you're right you're right it's a slippery slope once you start allowing people to do things that argument is going to work for all kinds of think terrible things that people do my whole argument the whole thing that I've been trying to say for the last whatever I've been doing this not two three years I mean holy is that we have lost touch with what causes what what not with the rules everybody wants the rules everybody wants to know what the rules are you can't know the rules if you don't know what virtue is if you don't know what right and wrong is and you can't know what right and wrong is unless you know what a person is for once you know what a person is for you can have all kinds of debates about right and wrong you know this I think I just said this about Ed fazer that you know we had a debate about gay marriage and we were both debating the same thing we both agreed that sex was for a certain purpose I had a more broad idea of how you could use sex in different ways he had a more idea about it but we both agreed that people were four things sex was for something if you lose that idea as we have you can't make out any arguments at all all right from Denise mr. Clavin I enjoy your show immensely and as a result of watching it as well as mr. Shapiro and mr. Noles Provost Knowles oh no I know I have been convinced that the importance of preserving Second Amendment rights however as a new convert I'm a little baffled by your vehement opposition to raising the age limit for purchasing a firearm we currently have an age limit for drinking and buying cigarettes this is much higher than the one for buying a gun please clarify for me what is so egregious about raising the legal age for gun ownership well first notice in your own question you talked about the the age limit for drinking and cigarettes those are vices owning a gun is not a vice that's what they've been trying to convince you of now here's the other thing every there are all kinds of answers to this but let me let me give a few of them every fact that they're talking about with guns is wrong as there have become more guns there's been less crime there was more there were more school shootings in the 1990s than there are now everything they're saying is wrong so why should we be having the discussion at all the latest shooting in Florida was caused by a a serial breakdown of government you know it was just government incompetence all the way from the federal government down to the local government why are we talking about guns why aren't we talking about government incompetence their basic argument the government the basic argument is the government failed to protect you it left this guy it left this guy collect guns and do what he wasn't supposed to do it stood there and did nothing while he ran in and killed you now give us all your guns that's a stupid argument why should we give them an inch why should they give them an inch the Constitution says your right to bear arms shall not be infringed that means exactly what it means sounds like it means they should not even take away the fringes of your right to bear arms now when it comes to young people you know the reason we believe in bearing arms are so that you can fight the power when they become tyrannical so you can fight the government when they become a chronic poor your best fighters young men why do they put who do they put in the army young men you can be in the army when you're 18 because those are the best fighters we have who is at risk of being attacked by somebody they can't defend themselves against young women young women you know you send your daughter to college you send her to someplace where she wants to do a job and maybe in a bad neighborhood I want her to have a gun I wanted to be able to protect yourself against somebody you know a guy who's maybe a hundred pounds heavier than she is and and won't be stopped by her fighting it's not you know Wonder Woman is a fantasy right guns are what make those things possible and finally do you take guns away from young people you're just creating more gun-free zones and we know that over ninety percent of these shootings take place in gun-free zones get here's the thing we know the left wants to take our guns and we know why they want to take our guns every now and again they actually spill it and they say it they want to take our guns we know why they want to take our guns because they want to be able to tell us what to do safely they we heard David Brooks was that yesterday we were talking about David Brooks talking about how isn't it wonderful now you can't say that marriage is between a man and woman without losing your job now you can't say that affirmative action is wrong which it is it's a terrible thing affirmative action you can't say it without losing your job isn't that wonderful they want you know people show up Ben goes to talk on college campuses they show up and riot they want to silence you they want to take away your freedom or your religious freedom they want to force you not to participate in gay weddings which even if that's against your religious rights Obama wanted people to pay for abortions we want a Catholic nun this to pay for abortions I mean and for birth control that they didn't believe we know they want this we know they want it why would you give them an inch as far as I'm concerned every baby born in America should be issued a bazooka and with a big flag on it that says come and take my rights Mullin lobby baby come and take it away every single baby born in America so don't let them have anything don't let them have anything cigarettes and liquor or a vice we should protect kids from them we don't have to protect kids from guns we just have to teach them how to use it and when to use it all right from see I'm really just this is just my way of flirting with Dana lash Spenser most Sur blood sublime purveyor of sublime ideas Clavin while I was listening to episode 7 of another which you should all be listening to by the way even though it's over we're planning the second season so you want to listen to it it's 13 episodes you can get it on any place where you get podcasts starring the world's heartthrob Michael Knowles in a very exciting fantasy suspense adventure alright so I was listening to episode 7 of another Kingdom the other day I couldn't help but notice that the character Serge Orosco bears an uncanny resemblance to the all-too-real megalomaniac George Soros both are foreign but foreign born billionaires with insidious plans to implant their egos indelibly into the course of history their similarities are further underscored by the fact that the name surgery Osmo appears to be an anagram of the name george soros with soros actually your inspiration for the orosco character or are these similarities a mere coincidence a mere coincidence Anna Andrew howdy big fan right here where do you see the Pfizer scandal going and will justice be served I don't make a lot of predictions and I'm not gonna make a prediction on this if you're talking about people being indicted if you're talking about like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama going to jail no none of that is going to happen the the real issue here is whether FISA courts are should be in operation at all are they protecting our rights as they were supposed to they're supposed to protect our rights from surveillance but they seem to be acting in a very very sloppy manner and so it's possible there might be some show indictments it's possible some low-level guy is gonna get in trouble with the courts because of something he did but the real problem is with the FISA courts themselves and since they just re-upped them the republic the republicans voting for them i don't see a lot of appetite for getting rid of them so basically what i think what i think we're fighting over here is the narrative that's what I really think well that's what a lot of these investigations are about I think they're about the narrative I think they're about saying is no Trump didn't do anything wrong by colluding with Russia it's the Democrats who did something wrong and that is where the battle is going to be fought it's gonna be fought and the media it's gonna be fought in the hearts of the part of the public we know which way the media is going to go but we want to get the facts and as the facts come out people do pay attention to the facts reality has a voice and people do listen to it so I think if justice is going to be done it's going to be you who do it it's not going to be the quartz that's that's my belief I did but I don't know now we have a question I don't usually allow this but we let our guy Austin get get a question in because he had a good question and he is technically a subscriber because they give us a subscription I have no idea what Austin does for a living he sits back there every now and again I hear his voice in my head said but what he's doing at drinking probably I have no idea but he he has this really interesting question which is can an AI and artificial intelligence have a relationship with Jesus Christ and if so can it go to heaven it's a great question you hear it you hear thoughts like this all the time my take on it is this we are not an intelligence person is not an intelligence a person is a complete entity he is a the spirit being spoken in the language of the flesh right so he's not a brain in a test-tube he is not a reasoning machine he has reason interacting with the flesh interacting with death interacting with aging interacting with disease interacting with lust interacting with all these things if you invent a person not an artificial intelligence but if you invent a person an actual person then yes of course I mean all Jesus's is God the Spirit of God the logos in the language of flesh so yes if you invented a person I don't think God cares if people are created in a test-tube I don't think God cares if people are created in a workshop if they are really people but AI is not people I don't care how good they get a playing chess I don't care if they can imitate poetry I don't care if they can imitate feelings if they are not in relationship with death if they're not in relationship with flesh they're actually or not a spirit being spoken in the language of flesh they may be something else in which case I have no idea how that works theologically but but if you can create a person I think yes the person can be in relation with Jesus Christ from Benjamin I am 20 years old and an aspiring writer I'm taking a few creative writing classes in college but I do not know what my next step should be is there any sort of apprenticeship or internship I could apply for thank you so much for considering my question I've been a subscriber and daily listener for a really long time you and Ben are the only people keeping me sane in this political right now I can understand that you know I mean when you pay when you watch TV you sit there and you go like what this is like a fantasy and you you know there's so much of it that even I occasionally get tempted to think like is it me is it you know am I wrong and then you kind of go back and read the Constitution the Bible and think oh no it's them it's always them writing being an aspiring writer very it you know I always say writing is a great job but a tough profession it's wonderful to do but it is a hard very difficult profession and it has gotten in some ways more difficult in some ways easier it's gotten more difficult because there's just so much material and there's so many people who want to spread your material around without paying you so a lot of people want eyes and I'll say I'll do anything to get eyes on my work but they don't take pay and of course I'm a professional writer and I always said what people people write to me all the time say will you write from my sight and I say well what do you pay they said well we don't pay but we have millions of subscribers and I say I'm a professional writer professional means you get paid for what you do you know that's why people do things professionally it's their living so it's gotten very difficult in that way here here's my the advice I give to writers read everything I mean read everything in your field if you want to be a novelist read every novel you can get your hands on I don't mean just the one that was written last week I mean Dickens Tolstoy Dostoevsky read all the greats if you're in a different field read that stuff really know what you're doing secondly and even this should be firstly really learned grammar because I get so many letters from writers who say you know I would like to be a writer and there's grammatical errors in their letter and you think like you know if they if a carpenter showed up at my house with a hammer and he said do you know how to use this thing you know like I you know he's holding the wrong end of the hammer and he's hitting with it I would just say get out here you're fired the same thing with writers this is these are your tools words are your tools grammar is your tools you can only break the rules if you know what they are what to do professionally well I believe I did everything wrong professionally and you know and I managed to get here through sheer grit and luck and determination but but I do think it's good to find a mentor if you can a really good mentor I do think it's good to find an internship with magazine it depends what kind of writing you want to do there's no internship for fiction you know these classes that people take I don't know how I never took one I don't know how helpful they are I suppose it's helpful to discuss with to get read readings from other people I think is always helpful but I think that if you can get an internship on a magazine if you want to be a journalist or a newspaper I think that's great and I think that the thing that helps writers that helped me as a writer more than anything was a job I had writing news because I had to hit deadlines every minute almost there were four televisions going on at the same time there was a radio plane there were and those days over teletypes which had this amazingly loud pounding noise in this newsroom I think there were four teletypes going and you had to write really well while that was going on so now when I sit in my workshop and maybe I hear a leaf blower down the street it's like dude you don't know who you're due to have to you have to bomb my workshop before you can disturb me so those are those are my pieces of advice it is a tough job I just I got a letter from somebody who got a rejection the other day and they were brokenhearted and I said there's a wonderful scene in Lawrence of Arabia the movie Lawrence of Arabia where Lawrence lights a match and lets it burn down to his fingers past his fingers and the guy watching him says what's the trick and Lawrence says the trick is not minding that it hurts and that is the way you have to do with rejection in the writing game the trick is not minding that it hurts so it's a tough profession you know and get it if you follow my mother's advice you'll become a lawyer and do it in your spare time I never did all right tickety-boo news where's the together see Austin Austin got the thing and then he dozed off because take any mood listen I am as you know really libertarian about people's sexual practices I don't care what people do as long as they don't hurt each other and that lie to each other it doesn't mean it's good for you doesn't mean you're doing the right thing it doesn't mean you're not sitting before God it means it's none of my business that's the only thing and but I have to say some of this S&M stuff that I see has really gotten to me and I like I don't mind a little you know slapping each other or whatever people do tying each other up with towels whatever you want to do what's what right what I see like I watched the show billions which I really enjoy I think I can't think some show time and one of the guys in is a masochist and his wife who is his dominatrix burns him with cigarettes and I'm like that I wouldn't I wouldn't be excited sexually for like a month after and then I saw that picture here Fifty Shades of Grey I kind of skimmed through it just to watch the sex scenes I was thinking you gotta be kidding me this is this is what women are daydreaming about they're like beating this poor woman up however however all that none of that has shocked me as much as what I saw this mistress velvet who is a black dominatrix who says that this is what she does to her clients listen to this it's very wonderful to be a black film I'm whipping a white man my name is mistress velvet I've been a dominatrix for four years and a goddess my whole life the core of my domination style is that I fall asleep my very first slave I had you are such a nice kind and smart person but you will never be a Dom and that like really upset no I don't want any white man telling me that there's something I can't do and so it kind of pushed me to like do a lot of research around BDSM and kind of cultivate myself as a Dom and what that kind of pushed them to engage in BDSM outside of like this what you think of it as just being beaten by some cruel woman why are women allowed to say that their goddess I wouldn't be if I came out and said I'm a God I've been a God my whole life oh you can't say that women could say I'm a goddess however what I want to just want to point out here and the reason I put this under tickety-boo news and not under sexual follies is because the she actually admits that reading black feminist theory to a man is torturing him and so every teacher in every school who is reading black feminist theory or for my money any kind of theory and certainly feminist theory is committing an act of dominatrix torture and you know boys you know what that makes you doesn't it that makes you the victim that makes you the sub do not do this good thing but finally finally somebody admits that reading this stuff to anybody is torture it is torturing somebody so at least mr. what's-his-name mistress of velvet misters velvet at least she's being an honest dominatrix oh good for her all right tomorrow do we who do we have tomorrow are we talking about homelessness somewhere
