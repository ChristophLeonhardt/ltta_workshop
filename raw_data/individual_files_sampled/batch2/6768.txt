YET ANOTHER STORY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT A SAD, SAD CLOWN HE IS, BUT THIS ONE IS VERY SERIOUS. IT COMES FROM GABRIEL SHERMAN AT VANITY FAIR, I WILL QUOTE IT AT LENGTH BECAUSE HE DID A GREAT JOB OF FINDING SOURCES INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE MENTAL STATE OF DONALD TRUMP. FIRST LET'S REMEMBER THAT BACK IN THE DAY HE TOLD REUTERS, THIS WAS 98 DAYS INTO OFFICE WHO THINKS THE PRESIDENCY WOULD BE EASIER? AND HE'S LIKE, GOLLY GEE, I WAS HAVING FUN BEFORE AND I WAS A CLOWN, I WAS PAID TO BE A CLOWN AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY FOR MY NAME TO BE PUT ON BUILDINGS, NOW I HAVE TO ACTUALLY MANAGE THINGS IN THE LAST TIME I DID THAT I BANKRUPTED SIX DIFFERENT COMPANIES. SO HE IS APPARENTLY SAD, BUT IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT. SHERMAN IS REPORTING THAT PEOPLE INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE AND CLOSE TO HIM SAY THAT TRUMP IS THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE CLOSE TO DONALD TRUMP SAYING THAT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIM. THEY ARE ON HIS SIDE, BUT THEY ARE WORRIED. NOW, WHEN YOU GET INTO THE DETAILS IT GETS WORSE. SHERMAN EXPLAINS THEY THINK MAYBE THE TIPPING POINT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CORKER REVELATIONS, WHERE CORKER SAID EVERYBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS ON PINS AND NEEDLES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DRIVE OFF THE ROAD AT ANY MINUTE AND THEY SPEND THEIR WHOLE TIME TRYING TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T DO GREAT DAMAGE. HE SAID IT'S ADULT DAY CARE OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE TURNING POINT IS NOT CORKER SAYING IT, THE TURNING POINT IS PEOPLE FEELING THAT WAY INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT THINGS HAVE GOTTEN EVEN WORSE, IF THAT'S IMAGINABLE, AND WE WILL GET INTO WHY IN A SECOND I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT HIS MOODS ARE, BUT I DO CARE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE MOODS ARE IF IT COMES TO POLICY, ESPECIALLY FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ISSUES OF WAR. THEY EXPLAIN WHY NOW I'M NOW GOING TO POSTULATE THAT IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT. HE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL HIM. HE IS PURELY EGO DRIVEN. IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT TRUMP, JUST THINK HOW DOES IT AFFECT HIS EGO? HE THOUGHT HE COULDN'T LOSE, EVEN THOUGH HE'S PASSED NO MAJOR LEGISLATION, HE HAS GOT NOTHING DONE. HE'S FRUSTRATED BY THAT BUT HE GOES IT'S OKAY, I KNOW POLITICS. I'M WINNING IN ALL THESE SPECIAL ELECTIONS. BUT THOSE HAPPENED BECAUSE YOU PICKED DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE TO BE IN YOUR CABINET AND THOSE WERE ELECTIONS TO REPLACE THEM IN DEEPLY RED DISTRICTS. BUT THE KNUCKLEHEAD THINGS I WON, THOSE GUYS ARE WINNING, I'M AWESOME, HE BACKS LUTHER STRANGE AND HE LOSES IN ALABAMA AND HE'S LIKE, WHAT IS GOING ON? AND IT'S A BLOW TO HIS EGO. NOW HE IS REELING. BUT THE REALITY IS OF COURSE HE MISUNDERSTANDS WHY HE WON IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THE PHENOMENON IN THE COUNTRY. AND BY THE WAY HE'S NOT ALONE IN THAT, I THINK MOST OF THE MAINSTREAM PRESS MISUNDERSTOOD THAT, CERTAINLY THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PARTIES MISUNDERSTOOD AS WELL. THE COUNTRY IS IN AN ANGRY, POPULIST MOOD, AND THEY HAD ONLY TWO CHOICES, PERSONALLY PERCEIVED AS ELITIST AND DEEPLY ESTABLISHMENT, AND A FAKE POPULIST, THEY WENT WITH THE FAKE POPULIST BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ELITES. SO WHY DID LUTHER STRANGE LOSE IN ALABAMA? BECAUSE ROY MOORE, WHO IS A LUNATIC IN ALABAMA, BUT WAS THE MORE POPULIST CANDIDATE, WON AGAIN. POPULISM WINS, NOT CALL OF PERSONALITY. BUT APPARENTLY THAT WAS A HUGE BLOW TO TRUMP'S EGO AND HENCE WHY HE'S IN A DARK MOOD AND READY TO LASH OUT. NOW MORE THAT'S A DEEP CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS POSSIBILITY, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSEST TO HIM, WORKING WITH HIM EVERY DAY, EVERY HOUR, THEY THINK HE'S UNSTABLE ENOUGH, AS BOB CORKER SAID, TO START WORLD WAR III. SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PRESIDENT GIVES IN ORDER TO LAUNCH A NUCLEAR STRIKE THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL, THAT WOULD KILL MILLIONS, AND MIGHT CAUSE RETALIATION THAT WOULD KILL MILLIONS OF OUR ALLIES AND PERHAPS OUR CITIZENS? WHAT DO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF DO? THEY FOLLOW THE ORDER, OR DO THEY STEP IN AND GO, 25TH AMENDMENT, THE GUY IS INSANE, WE HAVE TO GET THE CABINET TOGETHER AND REMOVE HIM FROM OFFICE. THAT'S A REAL POSSIBILITY AND THEY TALK ABOUT IT AT THE END, LET ME GET TO THAT IN A SECOND NOW, I THINK THEY ARE BEING A LITTLE TOO KIND TO HIM SAYING THAT HE'S GOTTEN WORSE, I THINK HE WAS ALWAYS UNSTABLE, I THINK HIS IQ IS UNBELIEVABLY LOW AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT LOW. GO BACK TO HIS QUOTES FROM THE 1980S, 90S, 2000S, ETC., HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PAINFULLY STUPID. HOW DO YOU THINK HE TOOK DADDY'S $200 MILLION AND BANKRUPTED HIMSELF SIX TIMES? I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ALL THE HISTORY, IF THEY HAVE TO PRETEND SOMETHING WENT WRONG RECENTLY, WONDERFUL, GET HIM OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE RIGHT, HE IS A DANGER TO THE WORLD, AND CERTAINLY TO US. AND TRUMP ALSO SENSES THAT HE IS IN A BAD PLACE, AND APPARENTLY HE TOLD HIS FORMER CHIEF OF SECURITY WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN, THEN HE BROUGHT THE GUY OVER FOR A WHILE TO THE WHITE HOUSE THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD HIM. NOW, THE WHITE HOUSE OF COURSE DENIES THAT HE SAID THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE GUYS AT THE WHITE HOUSE ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT A QUOTE THAT SAYS I HATE ALL OF YOU? THEY OF COURSE DENIED IT, BUT THAT IS IN THE VANITY FAIR PIECE. AND IT'S BECAUSE WHY? BECAUSE HE'S A CHILD, AND HE THINK I WANT IT, I WANT TO DESTROY EVERYTHING OBAMA DID, OH GOD, WE HAVE TO HAVE A VOTE ON IT? WHY DON'T WE KILL KIM JONG-UN AND GET RID OF NORTH KOREA, TOTALLY AND UTTERLY DESTROY THEM LIKE I'VE SAID ON TV? THAT WOULD BE HARD AND IT WOULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS, A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD DIE AND IT WOULD HURT OUR ALLIES, AND AS HE ONCE SAID, NORTH KOREA, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THIS COMPLICATED. HEALTHCARE, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THAT COMPLICATED. HIS IQ IS UNBELIEVABLY LOW, DANGEROUSLY LOW. OKAY IF YOU NOTICE, THAT'S NOT OUT OF DUTY TO DONALD TRUMP, IT'S OUT OF DUTY TO THE COUNTRY. HE IS IN GENERAL AND HE THINKS IF I LEAVE THIS CHILD COULD BREAK THE PLANET. I CAN'T GO BECAUSE I CAN'T TRUST THIS GUY TO MAKE ANY INFORMED DECISIONS, ANY RATIONAL DECISIONS, IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A BABYSITTER. THAT'S THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD BE THOSE MEASURES? AS I TOLD YOU, THE 25TH AMENDMENT. WE TALK ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT, I HAD A POLL A WHILE BACK THAT SAID THEY SHOULDN'T DO WITH THE 25TH AMENDMENT, IT SETS A BAD PRECEDENT, IF WE DISAGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT NO MATTER HOW MUCH, IT SETS GROUNDS FOR REMOVING HIM. IF THE PRESIDENT IS NOT INTELLIGENT AND WE DISAGREE WITH HIM, IT'S NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON, HE HAS TO ACTUALLY BE MENTALLY UNSTABLE, UNFIT FOR OFFICE, AND THAT IS A HEAVY BURDEN. GIVEN THE NEWS RECENTLY, I SWITCHED MY VOTE ON THAT, I THINK THEY SHOULD DO THE 25TH AMEND IT, I THINK HE'S MENTALLY UNFIT FOR OFFICE. APPARENTLY I'M NOT ALONE IN THINKING THAT. BACK TO VANITY FAIR THEREBY PROVING OUR POINT COMPLETELY. HE'S NEVER READ THE CONSTITUTION, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? HE USES IT AS A PUNCHLINE. IF YOU ARE OUT THERE AND YOU ARE A DENTIST AND YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THE AMENDMENTS, I HEAR YOU, BROTHER. THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB. IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT AND SOMEONE TELLS YOU ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT, AT LEAST HAVE ENOUGH SENSE TO GO I HEAR YOU, AND THEN WHEN HE LEAVES YOU GOOGLE IT. DON'T TELL YOUR CHIEF STRATEGIST, WHAT IS IN THE CONSTITUTION? WHAT IS THE 25TH AMENDMENT? THAT'S THE ONE WHERE YOU ARE SO STUPID THEY REMOVE YOU FROM OFFICE. PART OF IT IS FUNNY, PART OF IT IS DEADLY SERIOUS. I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK, TYTNETWORK.COM/25TH, IT WAS 70/30 BEFORE, 30% AGREEING WITH ME BEFORE THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE USED. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A PULL OF OUR VIEWERS, IT'S NOT A SCIENTIFIC POLL, WE AREN'T SAYING IT IS, BUT IF YOU ARE NOT WORRIED, YOU ARE WRONG. THE ENTIRE WHITE HOUSE, THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS, ACCORDING TO ONE OF THEIR OWN, BOB CORKER, HE SAID ALMOST THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IS WORRIED. YOU HAVE A GUY WHO IS MENTALLY UNFIT FOR OFFICE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AND THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON EARTH. IF YOU AREN'T WORRIED, YOU AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION. THEY HAVE TO GET HIM OUT, HE'S A DANGER TO THE WORLD.
