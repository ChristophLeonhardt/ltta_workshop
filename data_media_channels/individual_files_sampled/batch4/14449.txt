just try ignoring this crowd for far too long the victims of rape squads in the UK were ignored Rotherham Telford Rochdale Oxford Newcastle the list goes on but Tommy Robinson refused to look away despite known risks to his freedom he persisted reporting known facts from the street outside a court in Leeds where rape squad faced justice he was arrested simply for being there arrested charged and sentenced in five hours given 13 months inside Hull prison for contempt of court together with a sinister media ban to silence reporting of anything to do with his story and so here today outside Whitehall people protest some are here to protest the injustice of his sentence the moment we live in a country where you can get locked up for reporting on industrialised rape of young white girls the moment we reached that point is a complete disaster in the moment we reach a point where you can't criticise something that's the moment we lose who we are this country is known for free speech and people being able to say and do what they want and it has to be protected many can see the cruelty of a system where rapists and pedophiles walk free but a journalist reporting on them is jailed there's a problem with a grooming epidemic from the Muslim community and I won't say Muslim community and that needs to be tackled and there is also a massive problem in Islamic extremism I know because I've grown up with Muslims Pakistani Muslim pizza Pell gangs when we speak about these you know Rakhal traces recalled Islamophobic but there is something else the crowd are drawn by something bigger than Tommy something greater than one man old young mothers daughters and dads drawn together by a shared sense that our country has got it all wrong a Britain has lost its way that we side with the criminal and we have to speak out the truth because if we don't we're going to end up living in a place we don't want to live we're already seeing the freedom of speech is endangered I think Tommy's tremendously brave in what he does he's a very young man I'm not a very young man but I'm gonna say what I have to say because I feel that I have a duty to say it for the benefit of other people who can't but Islam is taking over the place we used to call home stand up against this persecution of people who criticize Islam when it is a persecution and we need to stand up to it we need to stand up and oppose it and we are not alone in this fight international leaders like gate builders from the freedom party are here from the Netherlands to show solidarity in our battle against the islamification of the UK but what unites all of us here what has brought these people to this place outside Whitehall in London is to show we will not be silenced we will not be told to look away from what is wrong British people are here to show that there are still right minded people in our country prepared to stand up for what is right the establishment will not silence us Tommie Robinson will not survive 13 months in prison what purpose does his sentence serve I wonder but to silence his voice a voice the establishment don't want to hear we stand together we stand with Tommy Robinson we will be heard to see more of my journalism and the truths not being told please visit Hopkins WorldCom you
