1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,720
>> FAMILY IN TENNESSEE HAS FILED
A FEDERAL CIVIL LAWSUITS AGAINST

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,590
A POLICE DEPARTMENT AFTER HE WAS
ARRESTED, RESTRAINED, AND TASED

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,570
SEVERAL TIMES WHILE HE WAS
RESTRAINED.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,570
THE TEENAGER AT THE

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,420
CENTER IS AN 18-YEAR-OLD.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:29,990
HE 

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,730
HAD
BEEN BOOKED ON CHARGES OF Ã± AND

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,980
APPARENTLY WHILE HE WAS IN A
CELL, HE HAD A MENTAL EPISODE

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,550
AND STARTED BANGING HIS HEAD
AGAINST THE WALL.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,660
COPS WHO WORK

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,320
TO THEIR RESTRAINED HIM AND
WHILE HE WAS RESTRAINED THEY

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
TASED HIM.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,750
WE HAVE THE VIDEO.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,559
IT
IS HARD TO LOOK AT.

15
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,559
I WANT TO

16
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,640
GIVE YOU A WARNING.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:11,899
LET'S TAKE A
LOOK.

18
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:18,049
>> SO HE IS OBVIOUSLY
RESTRAINED.

19
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,049
ARE THEY CLAIMING

20
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,030
THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY
DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO STUFF

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,869
AFTER?

22
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:25,360
OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST
GRATUITOUS TORTURE.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,369
>>THIS VIDEO WENT ON FOR A LONG
TIME.

24
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,510
IT IS REALLY HARD TO LOOK

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,049
AT.

26
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:43,619
THE WHOLE REASON WHY THE
TASER IS AVAILABLE IS SO THEY

27
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:53,290
CAN SUBDUE SOMEONE WHO IS NOT
EASILY SUBDUED.

28
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,280
THERE HAVE BEEN

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,850
CASES OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED
BECAUSE THE TASER HIT THEIR

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:17,560
HEART.

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,489
>> IF SOMEONE IS HAVING A MENTAL
EPISODE, PLEASE BRING IN AN

32
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,469
EXPERT.

33
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:36,040
YOU ARE APPLYING THE
WRONG TOOL TO THE JOB.

34
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
THE ISSUE

35
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,969
IS HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?

36
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:48,200
IF
THEY ARE HAVING A MENTAL EPISODE

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,090
THEY ARE NOT USING LOGIC.

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,389
YOU NEED A PROFESSIONAL TO HELP

39
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,480
YOU.

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,840
USING BRUTE FORCE IS LIKELY
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND WILL MAKE

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,959
HIM WANT TO REPEL MORE.

42
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:26,879
>> HE HAD AN EPISODE AND MAYBE
THAT IS WHY THEY WANTED TO

43
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:37,780
RESTRAIN HIM.

44
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,150
BY THE WAY HIS
STEPFATHER SAID THAT AFTER THE

45
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,309
TEEN WAS RELEASED ON BOND HE
COUNTED MORE THAN 40 BURNS ON

46
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:51,469
HIS BODY.

47
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:54,219
HERE IS MORE EVIDENCE
THEY PLAN ON USING IN THIS CASE.

48
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,369
IT IS JUST SO STUPID.

49
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:04,299
>> IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO THE
SAME THING, TRAINING.

50
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:05,299
AND NOT

51
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:25,789
EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES 

52
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:35,610
IT
THAT WAY.

53
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,610
SO LUCKILY IN THIS

54
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,840
CASE IT WAS NOT LETHAL BUT IT
COULD HAVE BEEN.

55
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
JUST BECAUSE

56
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,020
YOU HAVE A HAMMER DOESN'T
MEAN IT IS A NAIL.

57
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,060
THIS WAS NOT A HAMMER SITUATION.

58
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,130
>>LUCKILY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
MANAGED TO GET THAT VIDEO

59
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,370
RELEASED.

60
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:07,889
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE 
A

61
00:05:07,889 --> 00:00:00,000
CASE.
