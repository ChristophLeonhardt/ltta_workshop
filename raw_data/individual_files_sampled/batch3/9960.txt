YES. Bret: ALL RIGHT. MATT FINN IN ST. LOUIS. MATT, THANKS. PARTICIPANTS IN EVERYTHING FROM FANTASY FOOTBALL TO MARCH MADNESS POOLS TO BIG DOLLAR WAGERING ON GAMES AND MATCHES ARE REJOICING TONIGHT. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS RULED A FEDERAL LAW BANNING SPORTS GAMBLING IN MOST STATES IS ILLEGAL. MY COLLEAGUE AND CO-ANCHOR AT TONIGHT SHANNON BREAM TELLS US WHAT THAT MEANS. TODAY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IS SET TO UP END THE WORLD OF SPORTS GAMBLING. BLOCKING STATES FROM SPONSORING, OPERATING, ADVERTISING, PROMOTING LICENSING OR AUTHORIZING SPORTS GAMBLING IN MOST ALL SITUATIONS. BUT. WHAT THEY REALLY SAID WAS THAT CONGRESS DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO TELL STATE LEGISLATORS WHAT TO DO. THAT SHOULD BE UP TO LEGISLATORS AND THE VOTERS. JUDGE ALITO LIKENED THE LAW TO POSTING FEDERAL OFFICERS IN STATE CHAMBERS ARMED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO STOP LAWMAKERS FROM VOTING. QUOTE: A MORE DIRECT AFFRONT TO STATE SOVEREIGNTY IS NOT EASY TO IMAGINE. JUSTICE GINSBURG WRITING THE DISSENT ARGUED THE COURT COULD HAVE USED RESTRAINT IN NULLIFYING THE FEDERAL LAW RATHER THAN, QUOTE: DEPLOY A WRECKING BALL. ADDING WHEN A STATUTE REVEALS A CONSTITUTIONAL FLAW, THE COURT ORDINARILY ENGAGES IN A SALVAGE RATHER THAN A DEMOLITION OPERATION. THOUSAND PLAYS OUT WITH LIVER. STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY, DELAWARE, NEW JERSEY AND MISSISSIPPI ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE QUICKLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK ALREADY IN PLACE AT THE STATE LEVEL. GAMING ANALYSTS EXPECT AS MANY AS 32 STATES TO OFFER LEGAL BETTING WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THERE IS A FEDERAL LAW IN PLACE THAT APPEARS TO BAN GAMBLING ACROSS STATE LINES. MEANING STATES THAT DO MOVE FORWARD WITH LEGALIZED GAMBLING WILL HAVE TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF POLICING THEIR OWN CYBER BORDERS. WITH TODAY'S OPINION TO CLEARLY BACKING STATES' RIGHTS SOME EXPECT OTHER CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES COULD SOON BE RIPE FOR THE PICKING. THIS COULD IMPACT ANYTHING FROM MARIJUANA, GUN LAWS, REALLY WHAT THE COURT AFFIRMED WAS CONGRESS CANNOT COME MEN DEER THE STATES. WE ARE STILL AWAITING DECISIONS IN SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE CASES INCLUDING DISPUTES OVER RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
