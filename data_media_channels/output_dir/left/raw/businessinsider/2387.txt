welcome back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee answer let's</font>

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,940
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste any time let's get right to</font>

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,250
your questions the first one comes from

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,369
Sir Lorenz who asks how long can fed

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,350
keep in a long can the Fed keep

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,260
inflating the current bubble they look

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,390
breathless to me recently I don't think

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's really any limit to how long I</font>

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,840
mean there there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a limit but I</font>

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,550
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have any idea and I don't</font>

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe there's any reason to think it</font>

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,730
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japan has been trying to undo their</font>

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,070
deflation to inflate inflate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for years</font>

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,980
going on 20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now debt has been</font>

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,230
enormous and yet they<font color="#E5E5E5"> still keep selling</font>

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,300
their bonds interest rates remain low

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's confounded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone for years</font>

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,460
hedge funds have gotten killed trying to

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,170
bet when Japan would fail at this it

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,800
hasn't happened and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the price</font>

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,719
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gold showing some worrisome action I</font>

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,840
just wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to bet when this land</font>

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,580
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> question comes from Gordon do you</font>

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,320
think the Republicans will win or<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font>

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,270
net seats in Congress in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the midterm</font>

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">elections and do you think Obama will</font>

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,700
win the reelection absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it</font>

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,530
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unlikely to me that</font>

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,500
Republicans won't pick up seats in 2010

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,600
they had a pretty good congressional<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,900
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> off year election earlier this</font>

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,210
month they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> win all the races in</font>

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,100
particular the New York 23rd district

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,329
was kind of a disappointment for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

35
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,189
Conservative candidate but generally

36
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,960
they're doing well they have a ton of

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,840
issues to hammer hammer on and it's just

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,759
a just a fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the incumbent party</font>

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,439
tends to do badan off your elections

40
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,329
it's not necessarily that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Democrats</font>

41
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,549
are doing so bad it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how these you</font>

42
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,229
know it's a pendulum as for obama

43
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,840
winning the re-election<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know i'm</font>

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,820
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess yes if only because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Republican field still looks very</font>

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,689
weak and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know who's going to</font>

47
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,659
emerge if it's Sarah Palin she's not

48
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,509
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to win Mike Huckabee the media</font>

49
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,910
loved him<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the 2008 primary</font>

50
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,350
they'll be brutal to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like they</font>

51
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,540
turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> on John McCain and Mitt Romney I</font>

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,460
don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but maybe there's someone</font>

53
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,100
else who could come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so who knows</font>

54
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,480
another question also from Gordon has

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,340
got slipped in there do you think the

56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,870
stock market<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have an up here or</font>

57
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,750
down year in 2010 and will gold crash in

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,930
2010 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that I have a quarter</font>

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,030
here and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flip it so if it's</font>

60
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,070
heads then the stock market<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be up</font>

61
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,600
and if its tail's then i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,890
the stock market<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be down so let's</font>

63
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,140
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened I wasn't a good flip</font>

64
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,820
butt heads looks like it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,110
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> year for the market now let's do it</font>

66
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,700
for gold<font color="#CCCCCC"> hedge again so double up for</font>

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,130
stocks and gold in 2010 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coin said it</font>

68
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,870
is the suspension of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark-to-market</font>

69
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,120
accounting by the banks the same thing

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,950
is federally sanctioned accounting fraud

71
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,040
I'm not totally sure I am somewhat

72
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,410
swayed by arguments that in extreme

73
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,570
situations it doesn't make sense to mark

74
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything to market I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,210
satisfy free market intellectual purists

76
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,250
and it should be noted<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we didn't</font>

77
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,200
always have strict mark-to-market

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,750
accounting and things went<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I tend</font>

79
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,010
to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this issue might be a little</font>

80
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,209
overrated but i'm not i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see both</font>

81
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,209
points of view who in their right mind

82
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,850
gray asks is buying any stock right now

83
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,590
well anyone who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money</font>

84
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,420
since last March is buying stocks right

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,040
now and all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and all the</font>

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,990
naysayers of the quote most hated rally

87
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,760
of all time have gotten their clock

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,950
cleaned so you can laugh all you wanted

89
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,420
people who are buying stocks but they're

90
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,120
the ones making money not you if you

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
were given<font color="#E5E5E5"> four hundred thousand dollars</font>

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,739
but could only buy three things what

93
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,989
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> they be it's a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

94
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,390
question so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd probably by about 150</font>

95
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,709
thousand dollars worth of guns and no no

96
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,590
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need guns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I probably</font>

97
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">buy farmland just because you know as</font>

98
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">they say it's the ultimate hedge against</font>

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,380
calamity and I'm not really that worried

100
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,400
I don't think we're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,770
total societal breakdown but that might

102
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">be nice because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I could go live</font>

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,410
there and I've always want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow my</font>

104
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,480
own fruits and vegetables and rear

105
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,260
animals so even if it weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

106
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,060
farmland and maybe in New York no I

107
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,500
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford a new york apartment on</font>

108
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,190
that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

109
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you buy that one thing and then keep the</font>

110
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,210
esta na a diversified portfolio of

111
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,280
stocks bonds just precious metals and

112
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,370
stuff like that why do put up why do

113
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Americans put up with so much corruption</font>

114
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Simon's this is an interesting</font>

115
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,610
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just there</font>

116
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,800
clearly is tons and tons and tons of

117
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,930
corruption in our system the elites

118
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,490
whether they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the public sector or</font>

119
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,990
the private sector are clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

120
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,850
same side and it is frequently<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

121
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,130
little guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the taxpayer who gets screwed</font>

122
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,680
why do we put up with it I think the

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,660
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're scared to actually</font>

124
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,360
fight it so take all this bailout stuff

125
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,820
the AIG stuff that everyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

126
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,910
about we discover that Goldman Sachs got

127
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,070
massive payoffs and everything like that

128
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,320
and people claim to be outraged but in

129
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end the really scared of what would</font>

130
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,770
happen if the government just sort of

131
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,660
dropped the strings and let everything

132
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,540
go so we prefer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfort of</font>

133
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,550
corruption I believe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cold</font>

134
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,169
realities of the system where there's

135
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,050
nobody in charge all right Christopher

136
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,930
asks do you think the BS BCS will ever

137
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,140
be replaced by a playoff well I hope not

138
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,820
because I'm a huge fan of the bcs i

139
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,950
think it makes each week exciting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

140
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that if you lose one game</font>

141
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,400
we're pretty much screwed and out of the

142
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
national championship<font color="#CCCCCC"> game and i think</font>

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,760
if they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a playoff system it'd be</font>

144
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">like college basketball where I really</font>

145
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,970
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about it at all until we get</font>

146
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,340
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the playoff and so I hope not but I</font>

147
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,590
know Obama is in favor of a playoff<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

148
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,140
college football's so suppose it's

149
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,620
possible another good question from a

150
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,800
client 9 student the<font color="#CCCCCC"> student them if</font>

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,840
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> both in their prime could</font>

152
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">garry kasparov have beaten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bobby Fischer</font>

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a big chess fan and I think Bobby</font>

154
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,410
Fischer was amazing I think Kasparov

155
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,110
probably would I mean it's kind of hard

156
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,110
to say Kasparov is you know trained in

157
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,720
the age of computers the extent to which

game and refine everything down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,570
perfect level it i believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

161
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,610
unparalleled so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

162
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,250
know where Gary kasparov's level would

163
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,960
be in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different time but yet both in</font>

164
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,640
their prime I do believe Kasparov would

165
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,430
probably win and finally from roller 32
