THEIR HEINOUS CRIMES.
BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER TODAY,
I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON
HURRICANE MICHAEL, WHICH MADE
LANDFALL ON FLORIDA'S GREAT
PANHANDLE.
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN THE
PANHANDLE.
THEY WENT THROUGH A LOT.
FOLLOWED A REALLY DESTRUCTIVE
PATH.
THEN TO GEORGIA.
NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA.
OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THOSE WHO
LOST THEIR LIVES AND WITH THEIR
FAMILIES.
AND OUR HEARTS ARE WITH THE
THOUSANDS WHO HAVE SUSTAINED
PROPERTY DAMAGE IN MANY CASES IT
ENTIRELY WIPED OUT, THE MANY
FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN
DISPLACED AND MANY BUSINESSES
THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS
DEVASTATING HURRICANE.
ALL RESIDENTS SHOULD HEED ALL
LOCAL WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS.
MY ADMINISTRATION IS IN CONSTANT
CONTACT WITH STATE AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES IN FLORIDA, ALABAMA,
GEORGIA, SOUTH CAROLINA AND
NORTH CAROLINA 37 FEMA AND FIRST
RESPONDERS ARE ON THE GROUND AND
WE HAVE TEAMS CURRENTLY
CONDUCTING SEARCH AND RESCUE
MISSIONS.
BY THE WAY, THE COAST GUARD HAS
BEEN INCREDIBLE.
IT'S SAVED MANY LIVES.
WORKING TO RESTORE POWER AND
DELIVERING NEEDED SUPPLIES.
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR
POWER TO HELP THOSE IN NEED AND
WE WILL NOT REST OR WAIVER UNTIL
THE CLEANUP IS COMPLETE.
IT WAS SO FAST.
IT WENT THROUGH LIKE A BULLET,
BUT IT WAS A DEVASTATING BULLET.
IT WAS COMPLETE.
IT WAS WINDS ABOUT AS BIG AS
WE'VE EVER SEEN IN HISTORY.
WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK
EVERYBODY FOR WORKING SO HARD
