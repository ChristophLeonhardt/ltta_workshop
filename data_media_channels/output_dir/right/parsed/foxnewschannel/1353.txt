EXPENSIVE RACE IN TENNESSEE
HISTORY COULD CONTROL THE U.S.
SENATE.

DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE SENATE
DEMOCRATS ON.

FORMER GOVERNOR PHIL BROADUS AND
CALLS HIMSELF A PROBLEM SOLVER
AND IT REALLY MEANT MENTIONS THE

THAT PORTENDS BETTER FOR HIM
COME NOVEMBER.

ACT FOR A DEMOCRAT AND IT IN THE

ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES BUT HE’S
DOING OKAY.

FOR TWO TERMS AND HE HAS RUN
STATEWIDE THREE TIMES, THIS

RACE.

NAME.

LIKELY TO BE A TIGHT RACE, IS
