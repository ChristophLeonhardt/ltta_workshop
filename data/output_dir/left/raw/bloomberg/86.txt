1
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:05,641
There's an inherent attraction
to light and being human,

2
00:00:08,691 --> 00:00:12,196
and I think on a very
deep psychological level,

3
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:15,349
light is this way in which we experience

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,235
the energy surrounding us
in a very personal manner.

5
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:21,547
My name is Matt Dilling.

6
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:23,646
I'm the the founder of
Lite Brite Neon studio,

7
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:26,302
and we manufacture, produce, and restore

8
00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:28,979
neon works of art and design.

9
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:31,646
(neon sizzling)

10
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:35,545
Origins of the creative content

11
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:37,280
of a lot of the work at Lite Brite

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,352
comes from a variety of sources.

13
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,857
Sometimes people come
with a napkin sketch.

14
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:44,376
Some people come with an
Adobe Illustrator file.

15
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:46,317
And we have a whole design team,

16
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:47,601
who then we kind of work together

17
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:51,185
to help create layouts of
what it might look like.

18
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:55,352
Scale it up and create a paper
template using a pen plotter.

19
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:59,153
And that paper template
actually becomes our guide

20
00:00:59,153 --> 00:01:02,570
for what we're going to bend the neon to.

21
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:08,684
We take from the office
into the glass shop.

22
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:12,153
We pick out the right size tubing,

23
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:14,753
with the right color, for
the right size project.

24
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:17,984
(switches clicking)

25
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:18,817
(lighter flicking)

26
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:21,672
From there, we heat up the glass tubing.

27
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:24,505
(flame whooshing)

28
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:28,389
The torches heat the glass
well in excess of 1,000 degrees

29
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:32,139
in order for it to get
into its molten state.

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,912
We heat up and bend the glass
tubing to match the template.

31
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:41,336
One of our chandeliers has
over 100 different bends in it,

32
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:43,264
so each one of those
bends has to be marked

33
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:44,769
for a heated-up bend.

34
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:48,169
We also have to allow the
glass to cool between the bends

35
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:51,040
so that the next area can
be worked on and heated up

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,440
in its own unique fashion.

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
It turns into spaghetti,

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,417
and then we have to make
sure that that spaghetti

39
00:01:56,417 --> 00:02:00,417
lines back up and cools to the template.

40
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:03,720
We use a blow hose to
connect our mouth to the tube

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,641
to create a volume that's closed,

42
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:09,808
and we can control the pressure
in there with our mouth.

43
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:15,137
There's just a variety of
challenges that come up

44
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,887
inherently in working with glass.

45
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:21,573
Glass can crack due to stress,

46
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:24,120
and sometimes you'll just have a batch

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,287
that all it wants to do when
it gets near a torch is crack.

48
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:35,544
After we've bent various components,

49
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:38,472
we have to go in using the
cross-fire or the hand torch,

50
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:42,734
and actually weld all of
those pieces together.

51
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:43,982
The last step on that is then

52
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:46,902
to weld on electrodes onto either end.

53
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:50,819
Each one of those steps
is very, very specific.

54
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,773
I draw inspiration from so
many different experiences.

55
00:02:57,773 --> 00:03:01,212
It's hard to come up with
one thing that's particular,

56
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:03,388
but one of the ways that I really am able

57
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:06,805
to connect with the creative is to float.

58
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:13,541
Floating is a similar
experience to meditation,

59
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,109
to psychedelics.

60
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,348
Going into a blackened room

61
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:20,317
and laying out in a body of water and salt

62
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,924
that's heated to your body temperature,

63
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:23,757
and it allows

64
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:27,924
for all sort of external
stimulation to fall away,

65
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:33,189
and your internal world
really begins to bubble up

66
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,272
and manifest.

67
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,661
You really get to experience

68
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:40,828
a different relationship to your mind.

69
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:50,490
(flames whooshing)

70
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,657
I think I work with neon because
I can't not work with it.

71
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:59,970
It's so challenging and so rewarding,

72
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,930
and those things are so intertwined

73
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,762
that there's no way of separating it out.

74
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:06,986
I have learned so much,

75
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:10,058
and continue to learn so
much by working with it.

76
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:12,682
I find so much inspiration
in working with it,

77
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:16,610
and I just continue to experience
new and different things

78
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,714
through the medium.

79
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:20,714
It's that close to me at this point.

80
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:28,418
Once the neon tube is completed,

81
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:32,354
we have to hook it up to
our manifold for bombarding.

82
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,370
The manifold is opened,

83
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,870
a vacuum is drawn,

84
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:39,906
we check the tube for
leaks with our Tesla coil,

85
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,810
we close the tube back off,

86
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,826
and we heat it up

87
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:47,969
using a very large and
powerful transformer.

88
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,129
As the tube is heated up,

89
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:52,122
it releases anything that's
not inert inside the tube,

90
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:53,745
and we evacuate that out.

91
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:56,938
We introduce the gas into it,

92
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:58,282
and we seal the tube off,

93
00:04:58,282 --> 00:05:02,449
sealing into that tube whatever
gas we introduced into it.

94
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:06,562
I think my favorite part
of making a neon light

95
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:09,913
is when I see it lit
up for the first time.

96
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,849
Different gases, when electrified,

97
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:14,107
emit different wavelengths of light.

98
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:18,305
Neon gas is this very bright
orange, fiery red color.

99
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:21,579
Argon gas creates a very intense blue,

100
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,665
but that light output that is produced

101
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:26,026
can then be expressed in
a different wavelength

102
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,722
by coating the inside of the
tubes with a phosphor coating

103
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:31,754
that takes that one wavelength of light

104
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:34,504
and emits a different wavelength.

105
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:37,401
We bring it over to the aging table,

106
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:39,425
where we hook it up to
an aging transformer

107
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,777
and allow it to settle,

108
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:43,770
age the gas in that
we've introduced to it.

109
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,234
There's always a stray
particle of something

110
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:47,984
left inside the tube,

111
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,090
but that time that the oxide coating

112
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,529
can act to scrub whatever
is left inside the tube

113
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,223
while things are getting
settled into place.

114
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,806
(neon buzzing)

115
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,994
Once the tubes are aged in,

116
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:07,202
we move on to our process of assembling

117
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,162
two halves of the fixture
together in a jig,

118
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,290
gluing up the center of
the fixture to its spindle.

119
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,802
Once the adhesive dried,

120
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,411
we would connect the wires
from the fixture together

121
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,994
into a transformer,

122
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:24,188
and we turn on power, and it lights up.

123
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,540
Part of what we love about what we do here

124
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,684
is that we try and put out into the world

125
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:37,597
the kind of things that we'd like to see.

126
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,396
I still am surprised when it lights up.

127
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:44,060
I'm still excited when I
get to see it illuminated.

128
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,484
There's an ineffable quality to it.

129
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:48,444
To me, it's this insight

130
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:51,444
into the inner workings of the universe.

131
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,596
It literally is.

132
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:55,596
It's a way of looking at
what is surrounding us

133
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:58,013
in the cosmos in a new light.

134
00:07:00,757 --> 00:00:00,000
(tinkling)
