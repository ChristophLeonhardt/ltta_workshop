I started fencing when I was 9
at the Peter Westbrook Foundation.
And my mom brought my sister 
and I to the program
because she heard that they were 
producing all these black Olympians.
To be a representation for, you know, 
people like young black girls
who look like me and can see this as
an option. To see someone that
looks like them like medal or something
I think is powerful.
My name is Peter Westbrook.
I'm a six-time Olympian,
bronze medalist for the United States 
and the executive director of
the Peter Westbrook Foundation.
We have black children, white children, 
Asian children. We have so much diversity.
And our premier goal is to uplift and 
encourage one another.
Very difficult thing to do when you 
have your Olympic goals,
your Olympic dreams, world champion, 
national champion.
Very difficult to put those goals aside 
and uplift everyone else.
And that's what we do.
I think that being at the
Peter Westbrook Foundation
you learn camaraderie, you learn family, 
you learn to achieve at a high level.
And I think that the really powerful 
thing is you have beginners,
you have people who are the-up-and 
comers, you have elite people,
you have former champions and you have
these kind of people who are just really
passionate about the sport altogether 
kind of working towards one goal.
