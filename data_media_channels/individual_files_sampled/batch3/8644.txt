THE NUMBER OF VETERANS ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS HAS RISEN MORE THAN 50% BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT MY NEXT GUEST KNOWS ALL TOO WELL. KEVIN WAS SERVING WITH THE MARINES IN IRAQ WHEN HE WAS HIT BY AN IED AND SEVERELY INJURED. THE ROAD TO HEALING WAS LONG, REQUIRING 32 SURGERIES. KEVIN SOON FOUND HIMSELF STRUGGLING WITH OPIOID ADDICTION, BUT IT IS A BATTLE THAT KEVIN IS NOW WINNING. HE IS IN LONG-TERM RECOVERY AND HAS MADE IT HIS LIFE'S WORK TO HELP HIS FELLOW VETERANS COMBAT OPIOID ABUSE. HERE NOW IS KEVIN REMLEY, MARINE COMBAT VETERAN, PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT AND COORDINATOR OF VETERANS TREATMENT COURT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE. IT HAS BEEN FAR AND WIDE. TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU WERE IN THERE FOR TWO YEARS, YOU HAD 32 SURGERIES. YOU MADE IT THROUGH ALL OF THAT, BUT THEN YOU'RE STUCK WITH WITH AN ADDICTION. HOW DID YOU OVERCOME THAT? WILL THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY TO YOU. I, LIKE MANY VETERANS, WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL AND I HAD A LOST SENSE OF PURPOSE. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT MY NEXT STEPS WERE, BUT I DID HAVE OPIOIDS AND I FOUND OPIOIDS REALLY HELPED ME ADDRESS THE PHYSICAL ONES, BUT ALSO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WOUNDS OF WAR. BUT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM AND FAMILY MEMBERS THAT REALLY ENCOURAGED ME TO GET THE SUPPORT THAT I NEEDED AND GO TO THE ASHEVILLE VA AND FROM THERE I WAS PUT ON A MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT. I REALLY CREDITED WITH SAVING MY LIFE. Melissa: I KNOW THAT YOU WENT ON, YOU USED THE G.I. BILL TO GET AN EDUCATION AND YOU WANTED TO GO INTO SOCIAL WORK TO HELP OTHERS. YOU WERE AN INTERN YOU WERE INTERNED AT THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WHICH IS NOT WHAT YOU ADVOCATE FOR THAT TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH FOR VETERANS. TELL US WHAT THIS GROUP DOES. IT'S THE VETERANS TREATMENT CORE AND IN LIEU OF SENDING OUR VETERANS TO PRISON, THEY COMPLETE 18 MONTHS PLUS WHERE WE FOCUS ON TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION AND REALLY GETTING TO THE SOURCE OF THE SUFFERING THAT LED TO THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FOR OUR VETERANS. AND THE EXCITING PART TOO IS NOT ONLY ARE THEY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND THEY RECEIVE THE PROPER TREATMENT, BUT WE ARE FINDING THIS KIND OF RENEWED SENSE OF HOPE AND PURPOSE AT THE END OF THEIR JOURNEY SO THEY HAVE A STABLE JOB, STABLE HOUSE AND A YEAR AFTER GRADUATION FROM THE VETERANS TREATMENT CORE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO HAVE THEIR CHARGES DISMISSED. Melissa: WE SHOULD SAY THESE ARE FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS. YOU SAY THAT YOU SPENT ABOUT HALF OF YOUR TIME DOING THERAPY WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH AND HAVE FACE THAT STRUGGLE AND WANT TO TALK YOU ABOUT HOW YOU'VE MADE IT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE. IF YOU SPEND THE OTHER HALF OF YOUR TIME TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES FOR THOSE DOWN THE ROAD. HOW WIDESPREAD, HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK THAT THIS COULD HELP? WELL, WE KNOW THAT PROBLEM-SOLVING COURTS ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE. JUST SENDING AN INDIVIDUAL TO PRISON, THERE'S A 50% CHANCE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO RETURN. THEY ARE GOING TO RECIDIVATE. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF SPECIALTY COURTS LIKE THE VETERANS TREATMENT COURT IN DRUG COURT, NATIONALLY WE ONLY HAVE A 3% RECIDIVISM RATE. AS WE ARE LOOKING KIND OF AT WHERE WE WANT TO GO WITH THE FUTURE OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, I AM A BIG ADVOCATE FOR SECOND CHANCES. I WAS GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AND A SECOND CHANCE REALLY SAVED MY LIFE. I'M SEEING THE AMAZING RESULTS THAT CAN COME WHEN WE WORK ONE-ON-ONE WITH THESE VETERANS AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU WERE A HERO, YOU MAY BE AT ZERO RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET YOU BACK THERE. Melissa: YOU SAY ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING WHO WOULD LIKE DO SOMETHING. YOU HAVE A VERY SIMPLE ACTION ITEM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING, WHAT THEY CAN DO, TELL US ABOUT IT. THAT'S RIGHT. I REALLY JUST ENCOURAGE EVERYONE ON THIS SPECIAL MEMORIAL DAY TO JUST GO UP TO A VETERAN AND SIMPLY ASK HOW THEY ARE DOING. ALL THE TRAINING AND INTERVENTIONS THAT I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH THE YEARS OF EDUCATION, IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY THAT WE CAN SUPPORT A VETERAN IS SIMPLY TO BE THERE AS EMPATHIC AND CARING, LOVING, COMPASSIONATE FRIENDS, AND THAT WAS WHAT GOT ME THROUGH THIS JOURNEY AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME. Melissa: IT IS THE VERY LEAST THAT WE COULD DO FOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED THIS COUNTRY. KEVIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON TONIGHT AND SHARING YOUR STORY. I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE HELPED OUT THERE
