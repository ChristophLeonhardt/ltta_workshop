we have for supper st. salmon<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm okay</font>

83
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,930
so yesterday in my vlog I was talking

84
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the different effects but all I</font>

85
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,889
wanted to get so look up all the boss

86
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,229
pedals that I want if I got them all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

87
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the over a thousand dollars I was like</font>

88
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,000
what that's ridiculous like I got my

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,620
guitar for free and then have to say a

90
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,350
thousand dollars in effects pedals and I

91
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,930
figured if I got the entry-level pedals

92
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,870
I could get every penny I wanted for 250

93
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,150
bucks with that that's like good tax

94
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,030
including so like it's someone she

95
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,889
forget but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean obviously the sound</font>

96
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,870
quality and the durability of the pedals

97
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,220
are going to be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i think</font>

98
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,389
i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to start off with the</font>

99
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,330
cheap ones and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> gradually save up my</font>

100
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,820
money and get one or two or three of the

101
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,979
new ones i try to like ask like for

102
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,900
birthdays Christmas father's day all

103
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff to ask for it's even</font>

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,979
an expensive birthday present nobody on

105
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,080
the austerity present half half of it

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,570
yeah that is it possible there something

107
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,240

108
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,010
