>> Shannon: FBI AGENTS AREN'T

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,914
THE ONLY ONES FEELING THE HEAT

3
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,916
FROM THE WATCHDOG REPORT.

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,350
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, FORMER

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,318
OFFICIAL FOR SHARING INFORMATION

00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,087
ABOUT THE CLINTON EMAIL PROBE

7
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,022
WITH HER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,456
JOHN PODESTA.

9
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,492
THE IG SAYS FORMER ASSISTANT

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,526
ATTORNEY GENERAL PETER KESWICK

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,527
DEMONSTRATED POOR JUDGMENT IN

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,161
FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE

13
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,098
APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF

14
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:31,465
INTEREST.

15
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,300
KESWICK TRIED TO GET HIS SON A

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,902
JOB WITH DAILY CONTENT CAMPAIGN,

17
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:36,703
EMAILING A CLINTON STAFFER LET

18
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,105
ME KNOW IF YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE

19
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,107
NEEDS A GREAT ASSISTANT.

20
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:43,076
BY 25-YEAR-OLD SON IS READY FOR

21
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,278
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.

22
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,481
LET'S BRING IN PETER SCHWEIZER,

23
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,150
WELCOME.

24
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,685
LET'S START WITH PETER KADLEC.

25
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,553
HE CLEARLY HAD SOME CONNECTION,

26
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,855
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

27
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,725
CLINTON CAMPAIGN.

28
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,293
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT INITIAL

29
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,828
ASSESSMENT BY THE IG THAT THERE

30
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,763
WAS SOME KIND OF CONNECTION BUT

31
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,397
IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO TAINT THIS.

32
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,334
>> I THINK IT RAISES THE

33
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,535
QUESTION OF WHY WAS HE

34
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,569
INTERACTING THE WAY HE WAS AND

35
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,539
WHY WAS HE SHARING INFORMATION

36
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,107
WITH JOHN PODESTA?

37
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,076
THE IG REPORT POINTS OUT THAT HE

38
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,080
ACTUALLY TIPPED OFF JOHN PODESTA

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,714
WHO WAS HILLARY CLINTON'S

40
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,115
CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN ABOUT THE

41
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:22,783
RELEASE SCHEDULE OF THE

42
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,519
HILLARY CLINTON EMAILS IN 2016.

43
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,020
AT THE SAME TIME THAT IS YOUR

44
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,221
POINT OF OUTCOME HE IS TRYING TO

45
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,124
GET A JOB FOR HIS 25-YEAR-OLD

46
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:31,391
SON.

47
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,292
IT JUST LOOKS BAD.

48
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,428
THIS IS THE KIND OF SMALL FISH

49
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,931
BEHAVIOR PEOPLE DON'T LIKE.

50
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,165
YOU SAY DIDN'T REALLY BREAK ANY

51
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:39,499
LAWS.

52
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,301
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

53
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,536
THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF

54
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:44,104
JUSTICE.

55
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,138
WE EXPECT IMPARTIALITY AND WE

56
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,539
DON'T EXPECT THEM TO BE SHARING

57
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,340
INFORMATION THEY SHOULDN'T BE

58
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,908
SHARING WHILE THE SAME TIME

59
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,543
GETTING FAVORS FOR FAMILY

60
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,911
MEMBERS AND THAT'S CLEARLY WHAT

61
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:52,412
HE'S TRYING TO DO.

62
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,213
>> Shannon: SOMEONE ELSE

63
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,147
MENTIONED QUITE A FEW TIMES IN

64
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,116
THIS REPORT THAT A LOT OF FOLKS

65
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,317
MAY NOT HAVE EXPECTED TO FIGURE

66
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,153
SO PROMINENTLY IS FORMER

67
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:00,954
VIRGINIA GOVERNOR TERRY

68
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,354
McAULIFFE.

69
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,589
OBVIOUSLY VERY, VERY CLOSE TO

70
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,690
THE CLINTONS, KEY POLITICAL

71
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,791
PLAYER WITH THEM.

72
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,893
AND THE PARTY MORE BROADLY.

73
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,329
THERE IS TALK AND HEAR OF HIS

74
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,497
CONNECTION, HIS TAX CONNECTION

75
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,365
INTONATIONS TO ANDREW MCCABE'S

76
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:12,732
WIFE.

77
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,734
WE'VE BEEN OVER THE TERRITORY

78
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,335
BEFORE.

79
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,103
BUT THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF

80
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:17,871
ADMONISHMENT HERE THAT THERE

81
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,441
WERE SIZABLE DONATIONS THAT THE

82
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,876
RECUSAL TO HAPPEN BUT MAYBE IT

83
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,112
WASN'T FULLY RESPECTED BY

84
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,513
McCABE ONCE THIS WAS IN FULL

85
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:27,814
PLAY.

86
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,115
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

87
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,250
ENTER McCABE WAS TOLD TO

88
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,318
RECUSE HIMSELF AND NOT BE

89
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:32,919
INVOLVED IN THE CLINTON

90
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,520
FOUNDATION INVESTIGATION, AND HE

91
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,755
WAS ANYWAY.

92
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,890
LOOK, THIS IS THE WAY THE

93
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,892
CLINTONS OF OPERATED FOR MORE

94
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,094
THAN 40 YEARS IN POLITICS.

95
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,696
AND THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE A

96
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,831
NETWORK OF RELATIONSHIPS AND

97
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,498
FRIENDS.

98
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,333
IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT AS

99
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,436
FAR AS A LEGAL STANDARD IS

100
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,704
CONCERNED OF PROVING A QUID PROQ

101
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:51,904
CONCERNED OF PROVING A QUID PROO

102
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,973
CONCERNED OF PROVING A QUID PROR

103
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:54,941
SOME KIND OF COLLUSION

104
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,908
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IT'S A THIRD

105
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,944
PARTY INVOLVED IN THE

106
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,879
TRANSACTION.

107
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,081
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE,

108
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,882
HILLARY CLINTON IS UNDER

109
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,317
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI.

110
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:04,884
HILLARY CLINTON HAS NO

111
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,520
CONNECTION WITH ANDREW McKAY

112
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,821
BUT ONE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S

113
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,323
CLOSE POLITICAL ALLIES, THE

114
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,924
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDING

115
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:11,958
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINH

116
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:11,991
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINN

00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,024
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINR

00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:12,125
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINO

00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:12,158
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDIN

GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDIND

126
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:12,525
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, IS SENDINS

127
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,926
OF DOLLARS TO THE CAMPAIGN OF

128
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:16,896
ANGER McCABE'S WIFE.

129
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,364
IT'S TANGLED, INDIRECT, HARD TO

130
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,768
PROVE BUT IT STILL LEAVES THE

131
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,102
SAME KIND OF STENCH AND THAT'S

132
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,137
REALLY THE PROBLEM.

133
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,539
PEOPLE WILL SAY, SHANNON, WHY IS

134
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,173
THERE THIS OBSESSION WITH

135
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:27,940
HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON

136
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,809
ON ALL THE STUFF?

137
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,145
SHE'S NOT IN OFFICE ANYMORE.

138
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,513
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS NOT

139
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,280
ABOUT THE CLINTONS.

140
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,315
IT'S ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW.

141
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,016
IT'S ABOUT IMPARTIAL JUSTICE.

142
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,520
AND I THINK AS THIS IG REPORT

143
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,921
SHOWS, THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT

144
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,923
WHAT WE GOTTEN THESE CLINTON

145
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:44,390
INVESTIGATIONS.

146
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,858
>> Shannon: A LOT OF FOLKS,

147
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,159
CONSERVATIVES LOOKING AT THE

148
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,528
REPORTS AND HILLARY CLINTON GOT

149
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,097
ALL KINDS OF PASSES THAT SHE

150
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:51,664
SHOULDN'T HAVE.

151
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,666
EXCLUDED THERE WERE FINDINGS

152
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:58,304
THAT THE FBI AGENTS WERE

153
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,905
SUPPORTIVE OF HILLARY CLINTON

154
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,974
AND ANTI-DONALD TRUMP, THEN A

155
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:02,708
CANDIDATE.

156
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,543
HERE IS WHAT THE SENATE'S TOP

157
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:06,145
DEMOCRAT CHUCK SCHUMER HAD TO

158
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,279
SAY TODAY.

159
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,914
>> DIRECTOR COMEY'S MISHANDLING

160
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,516
OF THE PUBLICITY AROUND THE

161
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,784
CLINTON EMAIL CAMPAIGN WILL

162
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,319
PROVE TO THE BENEFIT OF THEN

163
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,220
CANDIDATE TRUMP COMING NOT THE

164
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,788
OTHER WAY AROUND.

165
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:19,291
IT WAS TRUMP WHO BENEFITED FROM

166
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,559
ALL THESE MISTAKES.

167
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,561
SO IT HARDLY REFLECTS DEEP STATE

168
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:23,329
OR BIAS AGAINST.

169
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,064
>> Shannon: THAT SORT OF SUMS

170
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,100
UP ALL THE PRESS RELEASES I GOT

171
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,301
FROM EVERY DEMOCRAT ON THE HILL

172
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:29,702
TODAY.

173
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,903
IT DIDN'T HELP HILLARY.

174
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,104
IT HURT HER.

175
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:32,905
AND HELP DONALD TRUMP.

176
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:33,906
THERE WAS NO BIAS.

177
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,541
THE G.O.P. IS TRYING TO LINK

178
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,742
THIS TO SOMEHOW DISCREDIT THE

179
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:37,276
MEAL INVESTIGATION.

180
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,112
THERE'S NO PROOF OF THE DEEP

181
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:40,412
STATE.

182
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,915
AND THAT JAMES COMEY WENT PUBLIC

183
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,049
WITH A HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL

184
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:45,217
INVESTIGATION BUT STAYED SILENT

185
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,885
ON THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

186
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,120
ON AND ON AND ON.

187
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,621
THEY SAY THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS

188
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,957
VERY BAD FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN

189
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:52,825
THE END.

190
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,493
>> DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE,

191
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:55,694
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

192
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:56,929
THE INVESTIGATION AND EVERY

193
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,630
SINGLE TURN WHETHER IT WAS THE

194
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,332
INTERVIEW WITH HER, THE

195
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:03,969
INTERVIEW WITH HER COLLEAGUES,

196
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,004
AND THE SPECIAL CONCESSIONS THEY

197
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:05,904
WERE GRANTED.

198
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:07,539
THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T

199
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,507
SUBPOENA THE DEVICES.

200
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,708
THEY SIMPLY ASKED FOR THEM.

201
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,777
I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON.

202
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:14,747
EACH ONE OF THOSE CASES THE

203
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,714
BENEFIT WAS TO HILLARY CLINTON.

204
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:17,916
IN ONE CASE IN WHICH THEY ARGUE

205
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,519
THAT IT HURT HILLARY CLINTON, IT

206
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,421
WAS THE COMEY ANNOUNCEMENTS OF

207
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,155
LEADER THAT THEY WERE REOPENING

208
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,924
THE INVESTIGATION.

209
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:28,293
HE HAD TO DO THAT BECAUSE HE HAD

210
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:28,994
TOLD A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE

211
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,197
EARLIER THAT THEY -- THERE WERE

212
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,198
NO EMAILS OUT THERE AND THERE

213
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,500
WAS NO LONGER THE CASE.

214
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,702
HE WAS FORCED TO DO THAT NOT OUT

215
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:40,305
OF POLITICAL CALCULATION BUT

216
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,708
BECAUSE HE FACED THE VERY REAL

217
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,608
POSSIBILITY OF BEING ACCUSED OF

218
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,744
LYING TO CONGRESS.

219
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,913
SO IT'S LAUGHABLE TO ME THAT

220
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:49,915
THEY TAKE ONE INCIDENT IN A LONG

221
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,550
CHAIN OF EVENTS AND SAY THIS ONE

222
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,318
INCIDENT PROVES THAT THERE WAS

223
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,119
NO BIAS.

224
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,821
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T LOOK AT THIS IN

225
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:56,688
ANY SYSTEMATIC WAY AND COME TO

226
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:59,558
ANY OTHER CONCLUSION THAT

227
00:05:59,558 --> 00:00:00,000
HILLARY CLINTON GOT FAVORABLE
