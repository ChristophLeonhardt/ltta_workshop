I tend to play the tough guy.
But I wasn’t tough enough to quit on my own.
Not until I tried CHANTIX.
CHANTIX, along with support, helps you quit smoking.
It reduced my urge to smoke to the point that I could stop.
When you try to quit smoking, with or without CHANTIX,
you may have nicotine withdrawal symptoms.
Some people had changes in behavior or thinking,
aggression, hostility, agitation, depressed mood,
or suicidal thoughts or actions with CHANTIX.
Serious side effects may include seizures,
new or worse heart or blood vessel problems,
sleepwalking or allergic and skin reactions
which can be life-threatening.
Stop CHANTIX and get help right away
if you have any of these.
Tell your healthcare provider if you’ve had
depression or other mental health problems.
Decrease alcohol use while taking CHANTIX.
Use caution when driving or operating machinery.
The most common side effect is nausea.
My favorite role so far?
Being a non-smoker.
No question about it.
Talk to your doctor about CHANTIX.
