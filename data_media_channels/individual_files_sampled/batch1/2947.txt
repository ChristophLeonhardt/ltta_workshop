so the way that you can can understand someone's goals and use that understanding to make sure you're giving them the right opportunity for them is simply to have two conversations with them I think the first conversation that you want to have with someone is sort of a get to know you conversation starting with kindergarten tell me about your life and as you as you have this conversation you want to focus in on pivots that the person has made throughout their life and understand why did you make that change and from that question you'll understand what motivates somebody so somebody was a cheerleader and then they became a swimmer because they really could see more results of time in the pool on the swim team and they could have a cheerleader then you know this person is results oriented you start to see whether it's hard work or what not that really motivates the person but you get a much richer more textured view of the person if you understand these sort of abstractions in the context of their actual life story and don't be intrusive obviously the person doesn't want to tell you about their childhood you're not a shrink you're the boss right so so so be be sensitive to how the other person is feeling so that's one conversation the next conversation that I recommend that you have with people to sort of understand what their goals are is is what I call the dreams conversation so ask somebody at the pinnacle of your life I mean everything is going just the way you want it tell me what it looks like what are your dreams and don't ask for just one dream because very few of us really know what we want to be when we grow up and those who do confuse the heck out of the rest of us so give people opportunity to have several different dreams and when you have this conversation about somebody's dreams you'll begin to see what are the skills that they need to develop what are the things they need to learn who are the people they need to meet in order to take the step in the direction of those dreams and even when their current job is being really different than their long-term dream you'll often find that there ways you can change the dot job you can give them different projects you can give them some additional responsibilities you can offered it and make it reductions for the person you can you can offer to get them some training or some some education or go to a conference and those things will now be relevant to their current job but also be taking them a step in the direction of their dreams and that gives work a lot more meaning for people
