ponytail there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> pink it's just</font>

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,190
like this like liquid stuff as it

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,199
hardens and dries and it comes right off

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,230
with water so we thought that'd be fun

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:28,230
right and she was saying to me um she

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">said oh I hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it and I</font>

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,450
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if they don't like it you like</font>

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,219
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what matters so don't</font>

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,930
worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what other people think so</font>

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,020
good lesson for today hey so I just got

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,379
the new stickers for our car it costs

14
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,289
bring in a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks which sucks but</font>

15
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,309
I guess it's better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying a</font>

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,930
hundred dollar chicken every time they

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,020
pull you over and they told me this time

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,370
that I am going to have to pay to get an

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,160
ambitious<font color="#CCCCCC"> jack every single time every</font>

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">single every other year so every time I</font>

21
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,290
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this sticker for my car I'm</font>

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,939
gonna have to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid and mrs.</font>

23
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">jack which is like a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of bucks</font>

24
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,299
something and then there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,740
smallest thing wrong with your car you

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,790
got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed before the</font>

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,799
interview so I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing that</font>

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,520
which totally sucks because like

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,350
it can be expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

30
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,729
there's stupid little things they get

31
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,100
our band there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hug gates that</font>

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,140
tells you if your entire team or air and

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,049
if it's broken a light will come on to

34
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,520
say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gotta get that thing fixed</font>

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,250
and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding is if you have</font>

36
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">any lights on your dash then you can't</font>

37
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,240
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys and that stupid little</font>

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,130
gauge thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs like a hundred bucks</font>

39
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,409
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fix just so I</font>

40
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,140
can get past my e test maybe I'm wrong

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,319
but I'm pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the test</font>

42
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,689
is gonna make me have to do but yeah

43
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:49,369
it's kind of a bummer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least I got</font>

44
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,079
the stickers done there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

45
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,640
rain<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like 40 so I don't know what</font>

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm gonna be able to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sticker on</font>

47
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,000
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have it a dry spot</font>

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,549
right you can stick it on water so we'll

49
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:01,189
see at least that police officer was

50
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,409
kind enough not to charge it for all

51
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff and we just had me</font>

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,590
works walk home ever it was raining so

53
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,290
bad outside but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only is it just</font>

54
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,630
pouring rain it is flowing phrase so the

55
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,299
win is so strong you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold an</font>

56
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:24,920
umbrella because it goes inside out or

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,810

thankfully were under like a rain cover

65
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:56,900
on the stroller so they weren't too bad

66
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,690
