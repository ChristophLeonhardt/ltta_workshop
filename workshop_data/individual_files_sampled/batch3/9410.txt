IS FRESH OFF HER MEETING WITH KANYE WEST. SHE WILL GIVE US ALL OF THE DETAILS LATER IN THIS MEETING. HERE'S OUR OPENING MONOLOGUE. APPEASEMENT NEVER WORKS. TONIGHT, WE HAVE ANOTHER REMINDER. THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS NOW SOUNDING THE ALARM AND AS PER USUAL, THE PRIME MINISTER HAS PURE MORAL CLARITY. I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS. NOW THE PRIME MINISTER IS REVEALING ACCORDING TO THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM AS ALIVE AND WELL. THE IRANIANS CALL IT PROJECT A MOD. IT IS SECRET, ILLICIT, IT IS AN ONGOING SCHEME TO CONTRACT ON MY CONSTRUCT NUCLEAR WEAPONS AMENDED MEANS TO DELIVER THAT BY INCLUDING A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN TO DEVELOP FIVE WARHEADS, EACH CONTAINING A 10-KILOTON YIELD. HERE IS WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER OF NONTENURE SAID ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND INCREDIBLE PRESS CONFERENCE, INCREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE EARLIER TODAY. THIS WAS IRAN'S CHANCE TO FULLY COME CLEAN. THEY COULD TELL THE TRUTH. THEY COULD SAY, WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM, THIS SECRET PROGRAM, IT'S OVER, IT DOESN'T EXIST, WE DESTROYED THEM. HERE'S WHAT IRAN ACTUALLY TOLD THEM. IT SAID, IRAN DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF A COORDINATE PROGRAM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AND SPECIFICALLY DENIED THE EXISTENCE OF THE PLAN. THE MATERIAL PROVES OTHERWISE, THEY AUTHORIZED, INITIATED, AND FUNDED PROJECT AMAD. HERE'S ANOTHER DOCUMENT FROM THE ARCHIVE. A MASTER PLAN OF PROJECT AMAD. Sean: I'M TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER DID ALL THAT, ENTIRE PRESENTATION, POWERPOINT, WITHOUT ANY NOTES. REMEMBER, THIS JUST COMES THREE YEARS AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED OFF ON WHAT IS THE WORST TO DEAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, FRANKLY, THE WORLD. THE MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT WHERE THE UNITED STATES AGREED TO UNLOCK $150 BILLION ARE FROZEN IRANIAN ASSETS AND TO SEND ANOTHER 1.7 BILLION AND CASH INCLUDING AN INITIAL $400 MILLION DOWN PAYMENT, LITERALLY SHIPPED AND CARGO PLANES AND CASH AND OTHER CURRENCIES. SUBCRITICAL SANCTIONS WERE LIFTED AT THE TIME. WHAT DID WE GET IN RETURN? A PROMISE FROM RADICAL ISLAMIC MULLAHS OF IRAN THAT THEY TEMPORARILY HALT THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM? THE SAME MULLAHS THAT ACTIVELY PLAN FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL? THE SAME MUSCLES THAT CHANT "DEATH TO AMERICA, DEATH TO ISRAEL," THAT FUND TERRORISM ALL OVER THE WAR THAT ARE FIGHTING PROXY WAR AFTER PROXY WAR IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AND ELSEWHERE? THE SAME MULLAHS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING U.S. SOLDIERS IN IRAQ, HOLDING OTHER AMERICANS HOSTAGE? REMEMBER, OBAMA TOLD US, THIS WAS GOOD FOR THE WORLD? WE WARNED YOU. THIS AGREEMENT WAS ALWAYS A SHAM. NO DIFFERENT THAN WHEN NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN DECLARED PEACE IN HIS TIME AND SIGNED OFF ON A DEAL TRYING TO APPEASE ADOLF HITLER. NO DIFFERENT THAN WHEN BILL CLINTON APPEASED KIM JONG UN'S FATHER, KIM JONG IL, IN THE AGREEMENT CLINTON PROMISED THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT WILL HALT NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM AND AMBITION ONCE AND FOR ALL. IN 2015, OBAMA WANTED YOU TO BELIEVE ONCE AGAIN, IF ONLY WE KISSED THE RINGS OF TEST BEDS AND RADICALS AND DICTATORS, SOMEHOW, THEY WILL BE NICE TO US. FAULTY, FIELD LOGIC. APPEASEMENT NEVER WORKS. PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW FACES A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION, WHETHER OR NOT TO HOLD IRAN ACCOUNTABLE AND PULL THE U.S. OUT OF THIS DEEPLY FLAWED AGREEMENT. HERE IS HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP REACTED TO THIS INCREDIBLE, BREAKING DEVELOPMENT TODAY. SEVEN YEARS, THAT DEAL WILL HAVE EXPIRED AND IRAN IS FREE TO GO AHEAD AND CREATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. SEVEN YEARS IS TOMORROW. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT'S A HORRIBLE AGREEMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE FACT, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT WE GAVE IRAN $150,000,000,000.1.8 BILLION IN CASH. NIGERIA WOULD LIKE SOME OF THAT. 1.8 BILLION IN CASH. $150 BILLION. YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT? WE GOT NOTHING. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE A NEW IDEA. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT I THINK IF ANYTHING, WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST LITTLE WHILE AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED HAS REALLY SHOWN THAT I'VE BEEN 100% RIGHT. Sean: THERE ARE MOMENTS IN HISTORY YOU HAVE TO LEARN FROM AND THE DEVASTATING FAILURES OF APPEASEMENT, NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN, BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS WAY, IT ALL HAS TAUGHT US, APPEASEMENT NEVER WORKS. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH DOES WORK PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH DOES WOR WORK. THIS BRINGS US TO OUR NEXT TOPIC. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HISTORIC DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO APPEASE KIM JONG UN OR BRIBE HIM WITH BOATLOADS OF CASH, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK SOME VERY TOUGH MEASURES. IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE ADMINISTRATION, REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT AND GREENISH SANCTIONS OF THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME. HE SENT MULTIPLE CARRIER STRIKE GROUPS ARE THE REASON. HE SQUEEZED HER NORTH KOREA'S MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PARTNER, CHINA, ALL THE WHILE CALLING HIM DRUNK ON LITTLE ROCKET MAN AND SAYING OUR BUTTON WORKS. THE MEDIA FREAKED OUT, PROCLAIMED TRUMP WILL LEAD US TO A NUCLEAR WAR. THEY SAID THE SAME THING WHEN REAGAN CALLED THE FORMER SOVIET UNION ON THE EVIL EMPIRE. WE KNEW BETTER ANOTHER PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT IS GREAT FOR THE WORLD. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, THIS IS HISTORIC THEM A LOOK AT THIS. KIM JONG UN CROSSING INTO SOUTH KOREA FOR THIS HISTORIC THEM A POSITIVE MEETING WITH SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON. A MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP, PRESIDENT MOON, AND KIM JONG UN AS MOVING FORWARD AS PLANNED. NOT DONE YET. CERTAINLY GOOD PROGRESS. ALSO BREAKING TODAY, ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH KOREAN SOURCES, THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR IS WILLING TO GIVE UP HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM COMPLETELY AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES AGREED TO OFFICIALLY END OF THE KOREAN WAR AND PROMISED NOT TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK. OVER THE WEEKEND DURING A RALLY IN MICHIGAN, THE CROWD REACTED, THIS IS WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER, AND I PROUDLY, 30 YEARS IN RADIO, 20 YEARS IN TB, HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A SINGLE ONE. I AM PROUD OF THAT. THIS IS THE CROWD REACTED TO THE DEVELOPMENTS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. TAKE A LOOK. I REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY ROUGH. THREE, FOUR MONTHS AGO. THAT'S VERY NICE. THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY NICE. NOBEL. I JUST WANT TO GET THE JOB DONE. Sean: I JUST WANT TO GET THE JOB DONE. EVERYONE ON THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, THEIR HEADS EXPLODED. THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT AGREES MOON IS NOW ECHOING THESE CALLS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO IN FACT, YES, RECEIVE THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. LET'S HOPE WE CAN PULL THIS OFF. THESE HISTORIC AND NOW FOR RAPIDLY EVOLVING DEVELOPMENTS FROM A KOREAN PENINSULA SHOULD GIVE EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD A SENSE OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM AND SOME ARE EVEN CALLING PRESIDENT TRUMP A TRANSFORMATIONAL PRESIDENT. THREE WORDS: PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WE'LL BRING YOU MORE ON THIS LATER IN THE SHOW BUT FIRST, THE DEEP STATE IS CRUMBLING RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES. NEARLY FIVE YEARS AGO, THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR JAMES CLAPPER, REMEMBER, HE BLATANTLY PERJURED HIMSELF IN FRONT OF CONGRESS? YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS MOMENT. DOES THE NSA COLLECT ANY TYPE OF DATA AT ALL ON MILLIONS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS? NO, SIR. IT DOES NOT? NOT WITTINGLY. THERE ARE CASES WHERE THEY COULD INADVERTENTLY, PERHAPS COLLECT, BUT NOT WITTINGLY. Sean: OF COURSE, A SHORT TIME LATER, WE LEARNED THE NSA WAS COLLECTING DATA. CLAPPER KNEW IT AND HE LIED. HE WAS NEVER CHARGED LIKE GENERAL FLYNN WITH LYING. THIS CASE, PERJURY. NOW CLAPPER HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN YET ANOTHER BOLD FACE LIE. ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE HOUSE AND TELL COMMITTEE DURING A CLOSED-DOOR HEARING, CLAPPER FLATLY DENIED EVER DISCUSSING THAT PHONY CLINTON BOUGHT AND PAID FOR STEEL RUSSIAN DOSSIER WITH A MEMBER OF THE MEDIA. HE ALSO REPEATED THIS CLAIM IN MARCH DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH DON LEMON AT CNN. TAKE A LOOK. I DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH MEDIA UNTIL AFTER I LEFT THE GOVERNMENT ON THE 20TH OF JANUARY. SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT I READ THAT SOMEHOW I LEAKED ABOUT THE DOSSIER. YOU DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT THE DOSSIER TO ANYBODY? NO. I MEAN, I TALKED ABOUT IT AFTER I LEFT THE GOVERNMENT. BUT NOT DURING THAT PERIOD AND CERTAINLY NOT BETWEEN THE SIXTH OF JANUARY AND THE TENTH WHEN THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HIMSELF TALKED ABOUT IT. Sean: AN INCREDIBLE DEVELOPMENT. THE INTEL COMMITTEE'S REPORT FOUND THAT CLAPPER "ADMITTED TO THE HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE AND PRIVATE TESTIMONY THAT HE BRIEFED CNN'S JAKE TAPPER IN EARLY JANUARY 2017." THIS WAS SHORTLY BEFORE TRUMP'S INAUGURATION. TAPPER ALONG WITH TWO OTHER JOURNALISTS, SO-CALLED JOURNALIST FROM CNN, PUBLISHED A REPORT DETAILING HOW TRUMP WAS BRIEFED ABOUT THE STEELE DOSSIER. A SHORT TIME LATER, JAMES CLAPPER, OH, HE'S HIRED BY FAKE NEWS CNN AS AN ANALYST. YOU CONNECT THE DOTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP REACTED ON TWITTER, WRITING... NOW IF CLAPPER DOES NOT FACE LEGAL JEOPARDY OVER THIS BLATANT PERJURY TO CONGRESS, IT WILL BE YET ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I SAY IS OUR TWO TIERED SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. HE'LL GO WITH THE HILLARY CLINTON SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. LET'S TURN TO THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. IF YOU THOUGHT THEY COULDN'T GET ANY MORE ANTI-TRUMP OR DOWNRIGHT VULGAR, THINK AGAIN. THEY OUTED THEMSELVES OVER THE WEEKEND. THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION HELD THEIR ANNUAL DINNER. I AM SO PROUD I HAVE NEVER BEEN, WHERE THEY TAKE SOME TIME TO HONOR THE MEDIA, PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK, JUST LIKE THEIR HOLLYWOOD BUDDIES, FOR THEIR COURAGEOUS WORK OF ECHOING EACH OTHER. PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO DID NOT ATTEND, PREVIEWED THE DINNER AT HIS RALLY IN MICHIGAN. HE DECIDED TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE, JUST LIKE HE DID LAST YEAR. GOOD CHOICE. BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, IS THIS BETTER THAN THAT PHONY WASHINGTON WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER? IS THIS MORE FUN? I COULD BE UP THERE TONIGHT SMILING LIKE I LOVE WHEN THEY ARE HITTING YOU COME I SHOT AFTER SHOT, THESE PEOPLE, THEY HATE YOUR GUTS, SHOT. AND YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO SMILE. AND IF YOU DON'T SMILE, THEY WILL SAY, HE WAS TERRIBLE, HE COULDN'T TAKE A HIT, AND IF YOU DO SMILE, THEY WILL SAY, WHAT DID HE SMILE ABOUT? THERE IS NO WINNING. Sean: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DESCRIPTION, ALL TOO ACCURATE. THIS YEAR'S SHOW FEATURED SUCH SO-CALLED COMEDIAN, FORMER DAILY SHOW CONTRIBUTOR, NEVER HEARD OF HER BEFORE, MICHELLE WOLF, DELIVERING A PERFORMANCE THAT IS SO VILE, ONE-SIDED, CRINGEWORTHY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO COVER YOUR EARS OF IO KIDS IN THE LIVING ROOM. MIKE PENCE IS ALSO VERY ANTICHOICE. HE THINKS ABORTION IS MURDER. WHICH, FIRST OF ALL, DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU TRY IT. AND WHEN YOU DO TRY IT, REALLY KNOCK IT. YOU KNOW IT, YOU GOT TO GET THAT BABY OUT OF THERE. YOU GUYS GOTTA STOP PUTTING KELLYANNE ON YOUR SHOW. ALL SHE DOES IS LIE. IF YOU DON'T GIVE HER A PLATFORM, SHE HAS NOWHERE TO LIE. IT'S LIKE THAT OLD SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS, HOW DO WE GET KELLYANNE UNDER THAT TREE? I'M NOT SUGGESTING SHE GETS HURT, JUST STUCK. IVANKA CLAIMS CLEANS UP N IVANKA CLAIMS CLEANS UP C IVANKA CLAIMS CLEANS UP . SHE'S THE DIAPER GENIE OF THE ADMINISTRATION. ON THE OUTSIDE SHE LOOKS SWEET BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT'S STILL . Sean: NOT EVEN FUNNY. IF YOU THINK THAT'S BAD, SHE SAVED HER WORST REMARKS FOR SARAH SANDERS, WHO WAS SITTING JUST FEET AWAY. TAKE A LOOK. AND OF COURSE, WE HAVE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WE ARE GRACED WITH SARAH'S PRESENCE TONIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY, I AM A LITTLE STARSTRUCK. I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LYDIA AND "THE HANDMAID'S TALE." I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SARAH. I THINK SHE'S VERY RESOURCEFUL. LIKE, SHE BURNS FACTS AND THEN SHE USES THE ASH TO CREATE A PERFECT SMOKY EYE. LIKE, MAYBE SHE'S BORN WITH IT. MAYBE ITS ALLIES. AND I'VE NEVER REALLY SURE WHAT TO CALL SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. YOU KNOW? IS THAT SARAH SANDERS, IS IT SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, IS IT BECAUSE IN HUCKABEE, IS IT ANTI-HUCKABEE SANDERS? BUT WHAT IS UNCLE TOM BUT FOR WHITE WOMEN WHO DISAPPOINT OTHER WHITE WOMEN? Sean: BY THE WAY, SARAH, KELLY AND, THEY TOOK IT WITH INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAR INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAH INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAS INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAN INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAE INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAS INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAR INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAG INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAT INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SAE INCREDIBLE GRACE, ESPECIALLY SA. A SO-CALLED PERFORMANCE WAS SO ASSOCIATION'S PRESIDENT REGRETS OVER WOLF'S REMARK AND SOME OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EVEN THEY CALLED OUT THIS SO-CALLED COMEDIAN. TAKE A LOOK. I THINK THE COMEDIAN CROSSED A LINE. THIS ONE FROM POKING FUN TO BEING MEAN-SPIRITED. IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. I THINK THAT SARAH SANDERS HANDLED HERSELF VERY WELL. THE DINNER IS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOURNALISM AND NOT THE RED CARPET, NOT THE MEAN-SPIRITED JOKE THAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT, SOME OF THOSE I REALLY THOUGHT WERE INAPPROPRIATE. THIS DINNER HAS HAD A LOT OF BAD MOMENTS. THINKING BACK, AS I WAS WATCHING THIS CRINGEWORTHY PERFORMANCE IN SOME RESPECTS GOING AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF SARAH SANDERS, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. I REALLY THOUGHT THE PAIN OF THE PEOPLE ON STAGE, WHEN SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS BEING MADE FUN OF, EVERYBODY FELT PAIN FOR HER. SHE FELT PAIN. IT REALLY BOTHERED ME. I KNOW THERE'S A BIG CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HER APPEARANCE WAS BEING MADE FUN OF OR NOT, COME ON. Sean: FOX NEWS ALERT, HANNITY AGREES WITH MIKA. JUST AS THE PRESIDENT TWEETED, THIS EVENT IS NOW DEAD. THE PRESIDENT IS INCREDIBLY SMART, NOT TO DIDN'T BUY THIS DINNER WITH HIS PRESENT TO PRESENCE. THEY WERE PROMPTLY MOCKED INTEGRATED, THE PRESS DESERVES NO SUCH CONSIDERATION GOING FORWARD. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN COME AT JOURNALISM IN THIS COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY DEAD. THEY ARE NOT JOURNALISTS. THEY ARE OPINION ADVOCACY HOSTS. THEY DON'T ADMIT IT. THE LAST STORY TONIGHT COMES FROM A SOUTHERN BORDER. FOR WEEKS, WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS LARGE CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS FROM SOUTH AMERICA AS THEY MARCHED THROUGH MEXICO HEADED TO THE U.S. BORDER. MEXICO DOES NOTHING AND KNOW DOZENS OF MIGRANTS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE BORDER AND THEY ARE DEMANDING ENTRY INTO THE U.S. WITH SOME ATTEMPTING TO SCALE A BORDER FENCE IN CALIFORNIA. PRESIDENT TRUMP WADE AND ALSO EARLIER TODAY. TAKE A LOOK. WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS. WE HAVE TO HAVE BORDERS. WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING FOR WEEKS AS THE CARAVAN CAME UP. AND YOU KNOW, THE MEXICAN MILES ARE VERY TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION, EXTREMELY TOUGH. AND IT STARTED OUT WITH WEIGH OVER 1,000 PEOPLE. I GUESS NOW IT'S DOWN TO A HUNDRED. YOU GOT TO HAVE A WALL.
