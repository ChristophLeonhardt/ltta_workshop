they're not being a regular politician you're not being like all the rest of them over there give me a sense of this last week of yours what are you doing that's different how do we know that you're different to the other politicians out there well the first part is that what we talk about that's the most important part we are reaching people for example the most common category of person if you like that is joining us our people that have never been involved in politics before and I'm really glad to say that we're getting people for example we've got an animal welfare policy so we're getting people from that area who have never had anyone really to vote for we're getting people concerned about Islam we're going to keep people concerned about the EU but in the way that we're concerned about it I don't believe that breaks it is going to happen I don't believe any appreciable version is going to happen it certainly won't mean an independent sovereign Britain I don't think anything any country will be free until the EU is gone and I think people are starting to see that I want to plant a post EU seed in people's minds because we have to start thinking of getting rid of the European Union these are new this is fresh so the most important thing is what we're saying and we're not disguising ourselves we're not going to be ashamed or dress it up as you know go around about weigh out an issue go at it directly go straight at it people are starved for this and I think the American people for example showed us they were starved for this Donald Trump won because he wasn't a politician he wanted to do something for his country I want us to be that I want us to be perceived the same I think we are being perceived the same and it's all about truth and trust and if you tell the truth the electorate will trust you you
