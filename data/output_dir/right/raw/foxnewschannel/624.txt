00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:17,342
WEEKS AGO AT THEIR HISTORIC

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,750
SO, IS THIS A TRUE SIGN OF

11
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,219
PROGRESS ON DENUKING THE

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,552
COUNTRY?

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.

18
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:36,395
SEBASTIAN, GOOD MORNING TO

>> GOOD MORNING, STEVE.

21
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:38,597
STEVE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

22
00:00:38,598 --> 00:00:39,831
THE FACT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE

23
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:40,966
THEY ARE PULLING THE PLUG ON

24
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:41,400
THAT FACILITY?

25
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,801
>> IF THE REPORTS ARE TRUE

26
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,870
IF THE SATELLITE IMAGES

27
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:46,872
AREN'T BEING INTERPRETED

28
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:50,809
CORRECTLY, IT'S VERY

29
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,344
SIGNIFICANT THESE ACTIONS

30
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:55,180
THIS IS POST THE SINGAPORE

31
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:55,514
SUMMIT.

32
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,582
THIS HAS TO BE A TANGIBLE

33
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,751
DECISION BY KIM.

34
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:01,453
THE BUREAU.

35
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,588
THE YOU WERE ECHELONS OF THE

36
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:04,623
NORTH KOREAN REGIME WHICH

37
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,525
WOULD BE PART OF THE

38
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:07,826
CONCRETE FOLLOW-UP TO THAT

39
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:09,127
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT.

40
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:10,529
I THINK, YOU KNOW, ONE OF

41
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,331
THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT HAS

42
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:13,899
HAPPENED SINCE SINGAPORE IS

43
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,468
THE CANCELLATION OF THE

44
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,636
ANNUAL ANTI-AMERICAN PARADE

45
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:18,837
BY PYONGYANG BECAUSE THAT'S

46
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:19,972
A VERY PUBLIC THING.

47
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:21,606
THE PEOPLE HAVE EXPECTATIONS

48
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:24,810
FOR THAT IDEOLOGY LADEN

49
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,544
EVENT.

50
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,244
THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY

51
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:28,780
STOPPED IT THEY SUSPENDED

52
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:29,514
THAT PARADE.

53
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:31,350
THIS IS THE BRASS TAX.

54
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,617
THIS IS THE REAL DEAL WHEN

55
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:35,153
IT COMES TO NORTH KOREA'S

56
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:37,222
CAPABILITY TO LAUNCH

57
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,557
BALLISTIC MISSILES.

58
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:39,257
STEVE: I WOULD IMAGINE THE

59
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:39,925
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

60
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:40,859
STATES IS FRUSTRATED THAT

61
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,661
THE PACE OF THE DENUKING IS

62
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:43,362
SO SLOW.

63
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:44,830
AND SO THAT'S WHY YESTERDAY

64
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,198
WHEN THE NEWS WAS MAYBE THEY

65
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:48,233
ARE PULLING THE PLUG ON THAT

66
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,468
SITE MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD

67
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:52,771
SOMETHING.

68
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:53,205
>> YEAH.

69
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:54,940
I HAVE USED PHRASE OFTEN

70
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,644
HE MOVES AT THE SPEED OF

71
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:00,379
TRUMP.

72
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:06,585
USED TO HERE IN THE SWAMP.

73
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:07,853
YOU LOOK AT THE LAST YEAR

74
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:08,253
AND A HALF.

75
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,286
THE THINGS THAT HE HAS

76
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,689
ACHIEVED IN JUST A YEAR AND

77
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,857
A HALF MOST PRESIDENTS WOULD

78
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:13,225
BE HAPPY WITH.

79
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:14,426
AFTER 8 YEARS IN OFFICE.

80
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:17,396
BUT, YES, I THINK AS A

81
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:18,697
BUSINESSMAN, WHO IS RESULTS

82
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:19,831
ORIENTED, IS HE PROBABLY A

83
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:20,832
LITTLE FRUSTRATED.

84
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,534
BUT, IN TERMS OF

85
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:25,370
INTERNATIONAL DEALS, ON ARMS

86
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,805
CONTROL, THIS IS PRETTY

87
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:28,407
FAST, ACTUALLY, STEVE.

88
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,843
KANSAS CITY AT THE VFW

89
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:32,844
CONVENTION WHEN TALKING

90
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,514
ABOUT IRAN NOW, HE SAID, YOU

91
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:36,915
KNOW, THAT COUNTRY IS

92
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,485
NOW WE ARE READY TO MAKE A

93
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:40,786
DEAL.

94
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,254
NOT LIKE THE LAST DEAL THE

95
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:48,326
ARE WE GETTING CLOSER?

96
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,432
FROM THE IRANIANS AND THEN

97
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,533
GOING BACK TOWARD THE

98
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:54,900
PRESIDENT?

99
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,700
>> I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT'S

100
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,969
HOW YOU TALK TO

101
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,237
DICTATORSHIPS.

102
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,809
LANGUAGE AND FANCY MEETINGS

103
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,377
IN GENEVA OR VIENNA.

104
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,745
YOU HIT THEM HARD AND TALK

105
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:07,446
STRAIGHT TO THEM.

106
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:08,747
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS

107
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:09,881
SIGNALING IN HIS GREAT

108
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,683
SPEECH YESTERDAY, HE

109
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,385
UNDERSTANDS HOW FRAGILE THIS

110
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:14,386
REGIME IS.

111
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,254
THE LOUDER THEY BARK, THE

112
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:16,855
WEAKER THEY ARE.

113
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:18,190
YOU LOOK AT THE

114
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:18,857
DEMONSTRATIONS, THE

115
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:21,460
DEMONSTRATIONS IN IRAN NOW,

116
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,429
UNLIKE 2009, WHEN WE HAD THE

117
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,830
REVOLUTION.

118
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,164
THEY ARE NOT JUST CENTERED

119
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:26,631
AROUND TEHRAN.

120
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:27,899
THEY ARE ALL AROUND THE

121
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,233
COUNTRY.

122
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,270
THIS IS THE TIME TO SQUEEZE

123
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:32,637
THEM.

124
00:03:32,638 --> 00:00:00,000
STEVE: ALL RIGHT.
