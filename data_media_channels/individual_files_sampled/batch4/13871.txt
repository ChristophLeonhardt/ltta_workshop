on Wednesday hyped up on rumors of Russian connections with the Trump administration CNN commentator Sally Kohn took to Twitter with her proposed solution to the turmoil shaking Washington DC here's what it looked like she wrote straightforward from here 1 impeach Trump in pence to constitutional crisis 3 call special election for Ryan versus Clinton 5 President Clinton it's good to dream Sally it's good to dream first off there's no evidence yet of any high crimes and misdemeanors necessary to begin an impeachment and then there's also a problem about impeachment cuz Republicans control both houses of Congress and then there's something called the line of succession if Trump and pence actually were impeached under the presidential succession act of 1947 as prescribed by the US Constitution Article 2 section 1 Paul Ryan would then become president so there's no constitutional crisis as Cohn sort of suggests and then how about that special election well I guess you'd need an act of Congress because that's not in the Constitution well Republicans control both houses of Congress so there's there's that as well and then continuing on Cohn suggests that the race would be Paul Ryan versus Hillary Clinton either side of that equation is actually guaranteed finally Cohn suggests Hillary would undoubtedly win the election which is kind of silly given she just lost the most unpopular presidential candidate in modern American history but it is good to know that Sally Kohn has an active imagination that she's still dreaming of president Hillary no doubt alongside President Hillary ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show everybody's losing their money it's it's wild so we will have a special surprise in just a moment here on the bench Shapiro show for our cultural correspondent or Andrew klevens cultural correspondent Michael moles will be showing up here to annoy us in just a few moments but first we have to say thank you sorry advertisers over at helix sleep

business unfortunately so I I've paid off a lot of bets over the last election because I was foolish enough to give odds never give odds it's always a mistake so I gave a bunch of odds and I actually forgotten that that I made a bet with Michael moles since I apparently decided to lose money to everyone in the office I've already I've already given small amounts of money to Jonathan hey I've given larger amounts of money to Michael Medved and David Bose I gave amounts of money to Jeremy boring or at least I will maybe but Michael I've been holding out on mainly because it's fun so I'm actually signing him the check come on here Michael and congratulations here is your check for hundred dollars for Michael moles I gave him four to one it's for $100 and I'm gonna write I'm gonna write here in the data line for ignoring data and then I'm gonna hand this over you will take a picture for the camera is really incredible there we go you absolutely go go always a pleasure I'll be at the F outta here all right now in other news everything continues to be crazy over in Washington DC and it continues to be crazy because everyone has decided to go absolutely insane nobody is telling you the truth okay this is the running theme of the show today's that no one is telling you the truth everybody tells you half the story but not the other half of the story so if you're on the right then what you're generally hearing today is about intelligence leaks and how terrible they are and intelligence leaks are bad right I mean and we'll talk about that in just a second and if we're on the Left all you're hearing about is how Michael Flynn is a secret agent of the Russians From Russia With Love right that's all you're hearing is that Moscow is now in control of the government nothing about the leaks so we're going to talk about all those things because we are not afraid of saying all the true things so we'll say all the true things on today's show we begin today with the media losing their gourds the media have lost their mind they have no concept of anything remotely approaching the appropriate they have no concept of anything remotely remotely approaching that the reasonable and so they've all gone crazy and they're suggesting that Mike Flynn the the national security advisor being ousted is the biggest story in the history of mankind ever since Jesus apparently rose from the dead or apparently since Moses received the tablets at Sinai or since the creation of earth this is the biggest news that has ever happened right depending on your religion this is the biggest news that has ever happened in the history of man and so here's a little montage of people from the from the media losing their minds this is Chuck Todd from NBC News and Thomas Friedman who has the brainpower of a slightly overused hairdryer and Dan Rather talking about how this Mike Flynn thing is just it's not just big it's the biggest it's not just the biggest it's huge so here they are welcome to MTP daily and welcome to day one of what is arguably the biggest presidential scandal involving a foreign government since iran-contra take a breath hyperbole aside folks hunker down because this is a class-five political hurricane that's hitting Washington all this hour we're going to dive into every angle of this breaking stories the White House scrambles to contain the fallout today White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters the president Trump knew for weeks that his national security advisor Michael Flynn had misled the vice president and apparently White House chief of staff Reince Priebus among other white US officials about discussions he had with Russia it's the biggest thing since around contre no no it's not it really isn't there's nothing maybe the evidence eventually will get there but no no it's not right now all we know is that Mike Flynn didn't tell Mike Pence that he had talked to the Russian ambassador about something that's the whole story I mean literally as far as we know that is the entire thing we don't know anything more than that those are all the verified facts thus far and I don't even think that's fireable as I discussed yesterday and we'll talk about sort of the theories of why floom was even fired because it seems really questionable to fire him based on sort of all the right-wing theories of what's going on here so Chuck Todd says the biggest in Tehran Contra the sort of ignoring things like Benghazi is sort of ignoring things like Barack Obama lying to the American people and Congress and everyone about the Iran deal until it was already done and Ben Rhodes bragging about it in the press it's sort of ignoring the weapons of mass destruction debacle under george w bush it's sort of ignoring the china gate scandal under president clinton there been a lot of a lot of real problems in foreign policy for for a long time you just wanna restrict it to scandals involving foreign governments then it seems to me that 2012 Barack Obama is saying openly on an hot mic that he wanted flexibility from the Russian government for his re-election campaign that's just as bad that's really not good okay so but Chuck's hats the were since iran-contra then there's Thomas Friedman of the New York Times so as they say has the the stunning brain power of an overused hairdryer here is a here's Thomas Friedman it gets Joe to to other issues the first is we have never taken seriously from the very beginning Russia hacked our election that was a 9/11 scale event they attacked the core of our very democracy that was a Pearl Harbor scale event can you imagine if Hillary Clinton you know where where Trump was what what the right would be doing on this issue so Friedman says can you imagine what the right would be doing if the situation were reversed well can you imagine what the left would be doing if the situation were reversed they'd be saying Hillary of course was going to win anyway because Trump was so unpopular the none of this is a they be saying exactly the same thing that a lot of people on the right are saying today show us the evidence no smoking gun it said but the idea that this is akin to 9/11 is akin to Pearl Harbor it's an attack on our very institutions of government and rural okay again you're gonna have to show me the people who died okay if you're gonna if you're gonna compare something to you know actual physical attacks in which thousands of Americans died you're gonna have to show me the actual Americans who died as opposed to just saying that leaked documents released by WikiLeaks which is bad okay I was against WikiLeaks all the way through the election cycle saying that that is equivalent to 911 or Pearl Harbor is so over the top it's insane and then there's Dan Rather okay dan Rather is the father of fake news dan Rather is the guy who went out there with a false document that george w bush went AWOL from the military back in the 1970s and then he was fired for it and now i don't know if the media has a death wish or if they're just suicidal or what there's saito masochistic i don't know if the story here is the media keep trotting out dan Rather as though he has something relevant to say on the nature of of truth and here's Dan Rather talking about well actually here so dan Rather I guess he I guess he just said this so this it well today to Facebook quotes with Dan Rather said on Facebook he said Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime until maybe now it was the closest we came to a debilitating constitutional crisis until maybe now the Russia scandal is somewhere around a five or six on the ten scale of Armageddon but it is cascading and intensity seemingly by the hour and Dan you're gonna have to calm there you're gonna have to calm to really wire the media so hot and bothered why are the media so up into arms over this whole thing because the media gets to celebrate themselves they get to pleasure themselves on camera brian Stelter over at CNN he says you know who this is really a big moment for this isn't a big moment for the American people it's not really moment for you know it's a big moment for us aren't we grand with Michael Flynn so that's right in plain sight for a while Andy and I come back with my moment for investigative journalism very this is mandatory led by the Washington Post of New York Times the CNN's of the world if it weren't for journalists digging digging digging into this we wouldn't know about it so when you hear about anonymous sources when you heard about leaks from the White House or from the government right yes is that what that's so important and we're seeing something else because this isn't a pat on the back this is the job the media is gonna do its job journalists will always do a job doesn't matter whether they're liked or not it's not a popularity contest but what are we seeing here in real time okay they break the story Flynn resigns he says in his letter basically I own this okay this wasn't some political trap set by the media he owned it okay walking brick Chris Cuomo is that is the person you're hearing at the very end there that we're always gonna do our job really where were you for the last eight years where were you under Barack Obama yeah I don't remember you trying to force out Lois Lerner in the same way that you tried to force out Mike Flynt and this brings up a real issue for the country and here's here's the the conservative take on this whole thing okay this brings up a real issue for the country but the issue for the country is less about Trump and Russia than it is about the fact that we now have collusion between the intelligence community and the media in order to undercut Trump and it really is a problem regardless were the electron-poor you don't like Trump it is not a good thing when the intelligence community is acting as a shadow government intervening in elections you know James Comey writing letters in the middle of elections left hated it now you've got the intelligence community leaking off the record like a sieve I mean it's not even a leak anymore it's now a gushing flood of information coming out to the media and it's all being delightfully overplayed by the media I'll give you two examples just over the last 12 hours so on Tuesday night the New York Times ran with this headline quote Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence has a pretty damning piece right I mean the idea is that they must have colluded with Russian intelligence to affect the election or shape policy they they had they they they were talking they were in coordination all the way with Russian intelligence and this was used as sort of the counter to the fact that Sean Spicer had said that nobody talked with Russia before the election because again the Trump administration is not competent Communications clip 10 Sean Spicer says that we've never talked at the Russians and here's the New York Times he's saying different now today can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign not even general Flynn had any contact with the Russians before the election my understanding is that what general Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period what we were very clear that during the transition period he did Fiat he did speak with the ambassador I don't have any I there's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period okay so here there he says that we've had no contact are in campaign and then the New York Times runs a piece saying there were contacts during the campaign looks shady looks like a cover-up but as James Barrett notes over its daily wire by the third paragraph of their 1300 word article The Times admits that they said so far they'd seen no evidence of cooperation between the Russians and the Trump campaign so Spicer isn't telling the truth there that Trump people weren't talking to the Russians but there was no evidence of cooperation and the New York Times acknowledges there's no evidence for any collusion with the Russians regarding the election and then later in the article the team of writers acknowledged that the contact that did allegedly take place between Trump's associates and Russian intelligence could have been done unwittingly so it's possible that Spicer isn't actually lying he just doesn't know the answer meaning we talked to people who are from Russia were they working for the Russian government I don't know and then CNN ran in her second story CNN runs another story today and their headline is Trump aides were in constant touch with senior Russian officials during campaign it's the yen idea if you're if you're reading that headline the impression you take away is there is coordination definite coordination the piece quotes multiple current and former intelligence law enforcement and administration officials so the leaks are plenty but then CNN reports quote officials emphasize that communications between campaign staff and representatives of foreign government are not unusual so they're not unusual the hell are we talking about here right presumably what they're really asking speiser is were there any covert coordination were there any covert communications between Trump team and Russian team but CNN can't say there was a New York Times can't say there was but the headlines seem to suggest there was I mean that's that's media malpractice why isn't the headline no evidence of coordination ari fleischer pointed this out why is there no headline says no evidence of coordination between Russian the Russian government Trump campaign and why is the intelligence community leaking all this stuff anonymously so Trump has been up in arms over this he's been tweeting incessantly about the intelligence community leaking and saying it's really inappropriate there's one problem with how Trump is doing this and that is the Trump is saying these leaks are wildly inappropriate and then he's also saying fake news okay either the leaks are true or the leaks are false you can't really say both the leaks are illegal and they're really damaging and they're really terrible and also they're false if they're false just say they're false right just say it's a bunch of crap and people who and the media I mean Trump is familiar with tweeting in all capital letters fake news but the real story here is not even about the media so much as it is about the Intel community so this is what people have been referring to is the deep state meaning the bureaucracy that is entrenched in power and isn't moving do they have an agenda to stop Donald Trump if so why is that agenda present and we'll talk about that when we continue over daily wire comm in order for you to see that you're gonna have to go over to Z Lee Weyer comm and subscribe right now $8 a month will get you a
