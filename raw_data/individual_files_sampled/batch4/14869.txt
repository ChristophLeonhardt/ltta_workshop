well I have to tell you my favorite newspaper in the United States is the Wall Street Journal I find it the most prestigious and in fact it has a larger circulation than the New York Times they say that the New York Times is read by people who think they run the country whereas the Wall Street Journal well they actually do and so it's real feather in his cap to have such a column published there as our friend dr. Daniel Pipes of the Middle East form has the headline is Venezuela's tyranny of bad ideas and dr. pipes joins us now via Skype great to see you congratulations I know it's a strange thing to focus on but the Wall Street Journal is really the most prestigious newspaper in America of other than what the alt left would would choose the New York Times congratulations well thank you on the conservative side it's D paper yeah that's a little son now you're the pressure in the Middle East form and so you and I talked a lot about the Arab world about Israel sometimes you you talk about Turkey quite a bit you're an expert in that subject what brought you to write about Venezuela which is on the other side of the world well I was expecting remember people say pop why are you talking about that as well look what do you know about them as well well I'll admit right off I don't know that much about them as well but I I've been thinking for months now that this is a very pure example of how bad ideas can move in the country you don't have to know an awful lot about Venezuela to see that this was a functioning country that in fact it was doing very well some 50 years ago not so well some 20 years ago that's Tina okay the flat economy basic things but a functioning country and then came sharp as Chavez with his terrible ideas of socialism and he wrote it now he was lucky because he died in March 2013 about a year or the oil prices started to collapse and so it is his hand-picked success of Nicolas Madero was even dumber and more brutal than Chavez himself who was inherited this mass and he's just making it worse worse daily one reads about mistakes he makes it makes it worse than recently are getting hungry and you could lose it in waking people bleeding people do demise when criminalized and it just gets worse we had ideas yeah it's so true and we try and talk to two activists in Venezuela every other month or so and the stories the horror stories keep getting worse I mean the average Venezuelan losing close to 20 pounds just from sheer malnutrition you know those of us who are a little bit fat or in my case a lot fat in the West you know we can joke wouldn't it be nice to lose 20 pounds not when you're forced to through starvation I wanted to point something out it's very interesting I learned this from your article and I'm gonna I think it's going to surprise a lot of our viewers up here in Canada you list the wealthiest countries in the world in 1950 as measured by GDP per capita and it's no surprise that the United States in 1950 was measured as the wealthiest country in the world and not too far behind was Switzerland I don't think that would shock people New Zealand comes in third I don't know if anyone would guess that I might have guessed Hong Kong boom but that's too early Hong Kong didn't really take off till later Venezuela was the fourth richest country in the richer than Canada richer than than the United Kingdom I guess they were still recovering from the war in 1950 if you were an ordinary Venezuelan you were wealthier than an ordinary Brit ordinary Frenchman ordinary Canadian ordinary Norwegian that's incredible to me but you know the thing about oil they got oil they start the oil wealth in 1914 something quite a while already the thing about oil wealth is that it doesn't guarantee you anything yes you can be richest closest look at a gobby example but you can also be very poor look at Iraq look at Libya and look at Venezuela so what you need is both Lior wealth and intelligence to run it and spend it and often fine but because the ruler has all wealth he doesn't have to depend in any way on his population and there we can indulge any kind of craziness think of Qaddafi any kind of craziness he wanted to do you could go for the end of the money right and then sees the same just they don't see the same chaves chaves what kind of trillion dollars US dollars in the 14 years of his presidency you know I've had the pleasure of traveling to Hong Kong a couple of times in my life and that's a country with really it's such a tiny country it really has no natural resources same with Singapore which is really just a city or even Switzerland which is on this list misfits Arlen has some natural resources but it's not famous for its mines or its timber or its oil it's it I don't think it has much of any of those things it's it's the rule of law it's the capitalist system it's a culture of work ethic high trust society democracy civil rights that's that's far better and indicator than oil well let me ask you a question because I see out of your home country the party on the Left the Democrats that used to be a center-left party and Republicans used to be a center-right party the Democrats in your home country have just nominated in Texas a far left local city mayor to be a candidate for Washington if I'm not mistaken the mayor of Tallahassee their star candidate from the Bronx Alexandria Cortez you know so I can't pronounce her name forgive me I think a lot of our viewers know who I'm talking about a delightful young lady who is a full-blown Marxist the Bernie Sanders wing of the party is on the march from Florida to New York to California it's the radical left is preaching socialism that are on the March and I think at least the college age cohorts are buying into it what do you think yeah what's so interesting is that with the collapse of the Soviet Union once all simultaneously a collapse of economic Marxism socialism that is to say of taking over corporations in the government run the economy that collapsed and instead the laughter went off into cultural Marxism transgenderism same-sex marriage and all those citizens now it looks like it's returning to economic the lesson that was learned some 30 years ago is yeah you know it's funny because I just remembered her full name Alexandra okay CEO Cortes so it's a it's a bit of a handful she is although she presents herself as a working class latina she she actually came from a middle-class background a lot of it is posing I think but I think there's something perverse about rich coddled kids at University which is these days is really a grownup daycare I mean not everyone obviously people are learning real skills but a lot of these kids are at the richest universities they're having all the benefits and luxuries in the ease and complacency of a capitalist society I find it a paradox that they would indulge an ideology that is the opposite of their own lifestyle they're preaching against capitalism while you know on their I was on their thousand dollar iPhones they're tweeting against capitalism from a Starbucks I don't get it what Israel that's always been the case from the 19th century on it was the middle class and it privilege to be more attracted to the ideals of socialism then of course as I say that died 30 years ago well the last was focused on the further issues of gender violence and race it's not focused on taking over the economy it looks like that's returning it looks like that lesson history learned again well unfortunately I think you're right and it's a shame that we can't learn from the pain and suffering of Venezuela that that isn't enough of an example I fear that we will have to pay a personal price before people are shocked out of their love for justice wouldn't sorry go ahead oasiz with this just as with the civil union we're good as well other leftist saying that's not socialism that's leftist embolism or state capitalism some other know that's that's socialist and that's the government taking it they're coming and it doesn't work it didn't work in the center Union it's not working yeah that's what the lens normally says well they tried socialism but not the correct way not the pure way they always say that well it was incredible doctor pipes once again the congratulations on this op-ed I know I'm speaking too much about where it was placed but it's such an authoritative article I would encourage all our readers to look at it we can finally The Wall Street Journal or on your own website Daniel Pipes org thanks for being with us today thank you very
