AND A DEMONSTRATION SATURDAY
OUTSIDE OF THE BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER IS DOWNING STREET
OFFICE.
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY FEW DAYS WERE
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON TWITTER.
HE IS ONCE AGAIN SLAMMING THE
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION
INTO ALLEGED RUSSIAN COLLUSION
AT HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND
URGING SCRUTINY OF THE
HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND
EFFORT.
THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO LINKING
THE PROBE TO THE COMING
MIDTERMS.
CHIEF INTELLIGENCE
CORRESPONDENCE
CATHERINE HERRIDGE SHOWS US HOW.
>> WHILE ON TWITTER PRESIDENT
ENABLED THEM 13 ANGRY DEMOCRATS
WHO WAS QUOTE MEDDLING WITH THE

THE INVESTOR GENERAL IS EXPECTED
TO TESTIFY A WEEK FROM TODAY.
