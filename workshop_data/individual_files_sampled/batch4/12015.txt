al Felsen Berg who has worn many hats in his long career in politics al has served as the principal spokesman for the 9/11 Commission director of the communications for the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress specialist system and advisor to the National Broadcasting Board of Governors consultant to the Secretary of the Navy director of community outreach and public liaison for the office of the secretary in defense department during the George Bush to administration assistant secretary of state of New Jersey under governor Tom keen fellow at the Institute of Politics at John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University as well as teaching positions of UPenn GW and Yale where Al helped to found the William F Buckley program and also was my professor he is the author of several books most recently his biography of William F Buckley Jr which we will be discussing today professor Belson Berg thank you for being here okay Michael it's a pleasure to be with you so to begin let's begin at the very beginning Buckley's siblings burned a cross outside of a Jewish resort in Sharon Connecticut in 1937 little bill then eleven years old quote his own words wept tears of frustration because he was too young to join them Buckley then famously purged the conservative movement that he helped to create of the cooks and the bigots and the racists and the anti-semites around the time he graduated college how did Buckley make that journey in just a little over a decade well this was a very different area and the era rather the 1930 Jews were not welcome and very various communities blacks were not welcome in many communities other groups were not welcome bill said that he didn't think that anti-semitism was a congenital disease but his father did suffer from it and he said as he got older he began to think for himself he got changed many of his views part of it was the army we're on the sheltered wealthy young man from Sharon Connecticut who had private tutors and many servants all the rest had met people different walks of life for the first time bit of a culture shock Jews from Brooklyn and and poles from and Ukrainians from Chicago and African Americans filled hands and all sorts of people that he hadn't been any time with and then of course the experience the Holocaust Eisenhower when troops were released from service at the end of the war insisted on showing footage of the American forces liberating the camps they saw the wreckage that Nazis brought they saw the condition of the some of the survivors who are in who were spared and of course all the deaths didn't cost you started thinking about it and yeah he had a roommate named Ginsburg and you may know the fencing defense club I think it's fine yeah I do yeah in a rather prominent society and Bill was clearly the one they most want he was a ban on campus too as the editor of the chairman of the Yale Daily News the champion of the winning yell debate club and the sense the society really wanted him and then he won Ginsburg's at that time that intake juice y'all had a restrictive quota or the number of Jews would accept a generation earlier had a similar quarter on Catholics and but bill said okay happy to join the club I come with Ginsburg or not at all and of course they both attended we're both through a minute a year later when skullenbones was having its final the competition what have you both men received an invitation skullenbones learned from the fence or the fence group and Ginsburg to my knowledge became the first Jewish member of us gone bone so with the long journey not that many years but it was a great deal of stuff they're cheap of course and now fast forwarding oh I would like to hop back and forth a little bit cuz one thing I love about your book so much is you include a lot of a lot of lines that come out of Buckley's papers Buckley's letters a lot of correspondence that we haven't seen it is no overstatement to say this is by far the most thorough biography of Buckley out there and you should certainly everyone should read it let's tackle the 300 the 239 pounds Carrillo in the room rather when Donald Trump nearly ran for president in 2000 as basically a left-wing candidate pushing late term abortion and gun control among other issues on the reform party line Buckley called him a narcissist and cautioned readers to avoid him 18 years later Heritage Foundation says that Trump is affecting their conservative agenda at a faster rate than even Ronald Reagan a Buckley called for tablet keepers conservative elites to guide American politics to the right and he also said that average Americans are far wiser than their leaders or their intellectuals here's the thing I would rather be governed by the first 2000 people in the Boston telephone directory and by the 2000 people on the faculty of Harvard University professor Pelton Berg was Buckley schizophrenic how do we reconcile these apparent contradictions well quite easily he started out his career I'm very concerned that a liberal elite was taking America down a wrong path and that was a path toward moral equivalency between the United States and Soviet Union he thought the Soviets playing for keeps and he saw all the situational ethics that were creeping into university curricula were weakening our fiber and it is things that we were stressing American greatness and American symbols quite well but he had also written as a young man that it seems not the the evil effects of what we call populism but the effects of the mob the effects of a mob manipulated by a demagogue who didn't seem to have any ideology except crowd-pleasing and rebel rousing he said he had seen this as a boy watching news reel in the Saturday matinees and he had seen the Nervii rallies that he had seen muscley several others and he said there was something about the mob that bothered him the the guttural style of much lenient Hitler and others and the finding of the scapegoat in the finding of the enemies and all of that he shuddered that in his own time he actually called George Wallace governor of Alabama that pointed about segregationist who was saying the student radical sat in front of his card be the NASA last time they'd walk again let's kind of think and attack pointy-headed bureaucrats and all of that he called Wallace a phoney conservative a false populist he said Wallace claimed to be a conservative claimed that to what want Washington interference but he took money from the federal government for roads for hospitals for schools for welfare for everything 60% of the Alabama budget came from Washington Wallace just didn't want blacks to receive any of the benefits and bucks we said he didn't want the program that was full of benefits and entitlements but if when I haven't didn't want any racial test he ended up by saying all right we have to go to the broader mass of the public they are smarter than most of the politicians I think that's still true I think I can prove that pieces I mean I still think that statement can be proved empirically but to guard against the mob and the fears that he had he wanted a conservative elite and you know if you're going to excommunicate people from a church or a movement you need a Curia to do it and he went after many people he went after an ran certainly not because of her libertarianism but he thought she confused libertarianism with libertinism and there are values he also didn't like her atheism and he said she was basically a mirror of Marxism that were they were atheists too and his most famous sight was this john birch society that has peddled conspiracy theories the most famous of course was robert welsh was a leader of the bird society most famous of which was a welsh assertion that the american government was in the hands of moscow and no lesser life and dwight eisenhower president understates was the conscious ation from the international communist conspiracy there was so much for Buckley he said that all movements are defined by their ponents by their weakest link in the chain because that was a pretty weak link he found quite a backlash he lost readers he loved subscribers you lost donors he loved speaking invitations but he toughed it out and he once said that was the proudest achievement of his life his greatest legacy so you need a conservative elite which he called the tablet beeper to decide what was in the realm of responsible conservative opinion that's where he ended up I wonder in that evolution because we know many friends and associates of Buckley you more than I I suspect I've asked some of them their thoughts on Trump on this moment and what they thought Buckley's thoughts would be on Trump run vary population and they seem to split I then asked a friend of ours at the Manhattan Institute and he said he thought that the 27 year old Buckley the polemicist the defender of Joe McCarthy he might have liked Trump and the 60 year olds Buckley the more mellow Buckley the no longer defending Joe McCarthy would almost certainly not have liked Trump how did Buckley's views and attitude not just the racism and the anti-semitism of his family and is used how did his views even on conservatism on the conservative movement in politics change over the course of his five decades in national politics well he changed his views on anti-semitism which we talked about he changed his views and isolationism his parents supported the old America first movement which is what a name of which gives some people every 60 moments to pause these talk about America first that was a movement Charles Lindbergh headed to stop America from helping Britain in its hour of need some of your listeners may have seen the movie darkest hour there's a scene with Franklin Roosevelt says that he couldn't help them because Lindbergh was most popular person in the country and some people thought he'd run for president in cases Muhammad changed his view on segregation he was on both sides a son of very proud southerners several of his grandparents were on the Confederate side and other other barbarous but he came to change that when he saw that the genteel southerners he knew were being replaced by the virulent type the rebel Bader's people like Wallace well I would put it this way McCarthy was a COAS mccarthy one of Buckley's contemporaries said that um McCarthy was doing the right thing in the wrong way hmm Buckley agreed was that his book on McCarthy came out before McCarthy went haywire attack US Army a lot of other thing that's happened but well what you're asking me I'll just confront this right on I mean the man was always a part of me of civility man was always trying to get to the higher plane the man who man who introduced Brideshead Revisited to American audiences on public television would have a lot to say about Donald Trump and you yourself says there is a 300 pound gorilla in the room I won't call him that 239 239 whatever he says anyway Buckley did not stir up the crowd but we did not have too many scapegoats that I remember where she said about the liberals as he stated they were misguided and he wanted to persuade them there's no persuasion going on right now there's a politics on the part of Trump an honest enemy of mobilizing your base base hasn't grown very much we talking about who's going on Rath Rushmore next time who's gonna be the next one candidate Reagan but once again what a dragon say in his inaugural address I'm looking at a giant what a trump say I'm looking at a carnage well Reagan said in his last address to the American people 1992 Republican convention that oh this is painful for some supporters of Trump to acknowledge Reagan said when I'm gone let it be said about me that I feel to your highest hopes like you worst fears that I took us to a higher level took us to a higher place when he died he couldn't find a single Democrat to say anything against him that's the test to greatness well welcome back we do well all of his life he was a free trader that's one opinion he never changed and he'd not be happy about the trade worth being lost right now he never saw a tax cut he opposed so he's not gonna start opposing it because he might have some problems with Donald Trump style he was support that he would he would support conservative judges but above all I mean he would talk about the role of the presidency as a inspiring office of potential to inspire the American people to greatness he talked about that he talked about president juicings like Reese Lavery I'm abolish slavery whether they do sink like unify the nation in the world wars they brought in their bases they appeal to the country's greatest traditions and highest hopes I don't think he would say we have that right now and even more than the policy more than the tax tax more than the judges he said there's nothing more important in our system of government the separation of powers the checks and balances and the fear of an imperial presidency that Congress is supposed to be the preeminent branch James Madison told us and they should come up with a program sent it up there and then negotiate with him the idea that the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate act half the time like presidential aides would have appalled him they were presidents he adored Ronald Reagan they were presidents he liked George Bush the first he always told them don't ramp things through negotiate with them but act like Congress Congress should be coming up with programs his hero of here Robert Taft and Robert Taft did that coming up with a program sent it to the hill and you send it to the White House rather and let's say the show got started so and I have to say finally looking at the CPAC speech you know Buckley had four bear escaped from County Cork in the 1840s around the time of the Irish Famine that's not the reason they came they settled in Ontario that made the way to Texas his grandfather was a the sheriff of Duval County greatness to this country you think about me as rich well he was quite rich father was a self-made Wildcat oil man and he managed to come up with in the middle of the depression they trust fund for each of the 10 children Buckley would not think that his forebears were snakes and you know it's funny it's nice it's laughs laughs laughs yuk yuk yuk I think a lot of damage was done by the president through the president the other week drawing out the red meat you know the other people are watching the French have a saying not in front of the servants or don't scare the horses I think a lot of horses got scared I do wonder right oh sorry please go ahead I'm talking I'm talking too much go ahead no no III wondered particularly about the CC pact speech because I thought given Trump given that Trump is the president and Trump is who he is something I liked about it is that he doesn't there's a sort of guileless to Donald Trump speaking whereas other politicians who are not terribly educated who are not terribly intellectual who are not terribly civil or well mannered or well brought up they affect something to that to that effect and it doesn't comport with the reality of them whereas with Donald Trump in a sense you what you see is what you get and I wonder you know Buckley was a refined man from a wealthy family he said that he never attended a professional baseball game and that was just fine he wouldn't pretend that he had you know the occasional threat to punch queer gore Vidal in the face notwithstanding he almost always I himself with grace and with impatience and area addition and but Buckley lived before Twitter and political discourse today from the top to the bottom is generally coarser baser more vulgar and that said the culture today is coarser and baser and more vulgar CNN anchors call constitutional conservatives gay slurs on national television they've been not along as teenagers compare a u.s. senator to a mass murderer is there any path back as you see it can you give away and you give me the unified politics and culture or the age of chivalry gone that of Safa stirs economists and calculators succeeded and the glory of Europe extinguished forever the answer is yes and the answer is starts with the president doesn't end with the president president told us that he was one of the best educated presidents when he ran he doesn't act like it I don't know too many Wharton grad to speak that way and he was proud to send his children Japan into Georgetown he's done an aprotic State he said into very fine schools before they went they come across much more sophisticated and fine than he does now maybe this is how he thinks that working people behave this is a nation where working people wanted to join the elite wanted their children to be better than they and wanted to rise not to live in the gutter and if you want to raise the caliber of the debate you start with the President William Shakespeare would have had no problem with Twitter the psalmist's would still be going around the world doing great great things Abraham Lincoln would have loved Twitter the Gettysburg Address is ten sentences and could fit on Twitter yeah what fit on Twitter well that's what I'm saying the best part of the speech were when he talked about policies and he's right conservatives talked for years about about the court they talked for years about ending the regulatory state they took four years of history and government he did it he probably did it way that none of the other Republicans running for president would have done although they would have agreed with it but his real message was the message about snakes and most of us are descended from immigrants and the concept of passports and visas that all of that started with the First World War I have no idea whether it's Buckley's forebears were legitimate or not legitimate I know mine they had some kind of papers you got at Ellis Island I didn't know what we had a visa then they were certainly you know allowed in and I don't think there were snakes they produced somebody who taught you and I think that the president of United States to go that route it's not an example that we want children to follow Anat what gets you want about Rushmore that's the goal there yes maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm crazy this I think does bring us to the Buckley rule this question of who we should vote for what is a bridge too far what sort of things should qualify Buckley and for those who don't know Buckley famously had this rule for voting he said to support the the right most viable candidate here and he didn't always abide that rule though he opposed the Eisenhower administration as we talked about is he a man for being insufficiently tougher on communism he supported Nixon even as Nixon grew the government and declared himself a Keynesian and founded the EPA EHA in title 9 and the forerunner of affirmative action and all that but he still supported that president and turned on next only when Nixon went to China and when Nixon went to bridge to power and then he opposed him about the ran for mayor against then nominal Republican John Lindsay who later became a Democrat when should conservatives vote for the most right viable candidate and when should conservatives refuse to support the most right viable candidate and when should conservatives turn on candidates that they've previously supported well first of all thank you Buckley supported Nixon because he thought that Nixon had a better chances if you give the democrats than the alternative you know it's our with bragging we broke with Nixon very early on the things you're talking about and his endorsement of next to the 72 was an argument the behalf of the lesser evil hmm and you know you vote the lesser evils you know what you get at the edges evil right but I would say to you well you were asking about the president when Buckley died for all I know in 2008 Donald Trump still Democrat he was giving money there was full of Z and mr. Schumer until he was president he didn't have much of a conservative record but he's now coming around talking about gun control and he stood and said he would never cut Social Security or reform entitlements sounds very much like Democrats to me and and I would say to you that he did do some great things on as I said them I'm not talking about what I sing expen about what Buckley might say he did carry the torch and judges who carried the torch that race and they carried the torch to deregulation he's not excuse me he's not carrying the torch in trade and I think he's he's not debase in the culture you're brilliant pointing out culture has been lowering itself by its own bootstraps for decades now but Reagan restored hope and promise we thought that after eight years of Obama telling us what we can't do and to accept the new norm of a one and a half two percent growth in the economy or Georgia's bushes over aggressive foreign policy now we would have a president to take this to a new level I don't think that's come and I again would say to you that Buckley even said in the article you you're quoting to me from with the Cigar Aficionado piece that demeanor and constitutionalism should come ahead of policy and with the left you say it comes ahead of healthcare with the right you say comes before tax cut you saved the Republic and then we can talk Peggy Noonan had a column and said the same thing she talks a lot because servitors she goes well but for this is good for taxes but for this he's good for regulation but for this it's good on judges well you could say that about Caligula for cancer I mean is there any point without 239 guerrilla needs to be given a course in manners and etiquette and how presidents behave I think that's what he would say now of course this you know a lot of people who were with the National Review we can't predict what Buckley would do he's been gone for a decade but we know what he did do so a lot of people in National Review or more inclined to go with the person who is adapting the policies they like and forget lots of other things I see the religious rights given the Donald Trump you know a mulligan something they wouldn't give any other person with a lifestyle that he used to boast about but Christianity is based on forgiveness change Redemption I get that very well but you really wonder sometimes said what weirdest character matter I think it counts I think character is destiny the Greeks are right this is not saying he has a deficient character I'm saying he wants to believe that he is the figure he created himself as a ghazzal chump he's got to be smarter than that he did get in Japan he did graduate at a pretty good record and he's got to be better than that he just feels that he has to you know be this creation be the role of the Donald Trump for the Donald and I think that again Buckley what did he bright costaud personality what he feared the boat it didn't an article this and we'll have to see what happens now the Donald Trump is singing trade wars and he had said that we have to start confiscating guns and worry about due process later yesterday and today it seems as though he has reversed that mercifully but what one has to see one wonders if the right can keep keep pushing Donald Trump more in line and maybe try to rein in some of his coarser instincts but this brings us to the final question which is about a legacy of buckley as you write in the final chapter of the book president george w bush summarized Buckley's place in history by saying he quote brought conservative thought into the political mainstream and helped lay the intellectual foundation for America's victory in the Cold War he places Buckley's thought in a particular time and Buckley is fusionist conservatism marrying the traditionalists and the libertarians through their shared anti-communism does become less relevant after the defeat of communism we saw huge cracks in the conservative movement after the fall of the Berlin Wall Buckley opposed george w bush's occupation of iraq there were disagreements over domestic policy ken Buckley's conservative vision survived the end of the Cold War and if it can survive it what does that mean in 2018 well I think your your summary is quite apt brilliant even a coalition came together for a short time against a common enemy and when your enemy is Stalin libertarians are traditionalists fine they have more in common with each other and they do with the enemy the enemy in wiping us out there's no question about it and with without Soviet Union and a bipolar world it's perfectly logical that would pray exactly with George well one of the anti-trump us who said long before trumpets a candidate if you look at the old conservative agenda as he put of the dogs are rejecting the dog food well I say that's an interesting concept and others were working on this before he came along but I Buckley would say in the end what matters are adherence to what he called eternal truth that all opinions are not of equal value but all cultures are not a vehicle value judeo-christian traditions are superior thank you America is superior and exceptional thank you and he would Harbor no compromise with those people who questioned that he was a steadfast opponent political correctness if the president really wants to pick up the Buffy mantel there was an article by ed Meese yesterday on some of the Obama executive orders that Trump can continue to reverse on political correctness I mean goddamn man at Yale was nothing but an attack on a political correctness at this time it's gotten quite worse now and I think that I have students that are arguing with me and with others about it they have a right to pick their pronoun I don't have a right to correct their grammar so I think write me notes that well I really know that they are or they is it's not a good way to put it but of course I want pronouns that are gendered neuter a president could do a great deal to stop this number and he doesn't have to do it by law or by decrees and I think that that would be a great tribute William F Buckley Jr but eternal truth our culture is superior to others it doesn't mean that we Ram it down people's throats we've sent armies but if you want to be an American you're expected to accept its Creed which is that which is part of the judeo-christian tradition you could be a Buddhist and be part of that tradition or any other relation or no religions be part of it and that yes American exceptionalism Reagan's notion that God puts this nation here between those two oceans to gather to its bosom people from all corners of the world and they created more civilization and more growth and more wealth than any great nation before us for us and our job is to pass it on in better condition than we found it and it's only a generation away from extinction unfortunately and which is why it's important to look back on past generations and read books like a man and his president the political Odyssey of William F Buckley Jr just a point by the way for the listeners as we're talking with the pronouns my preferred pronoun of course is milord or sir so you can alway if you're referring to me or something it's a good way to do it professor Belson Bri they're telling me I have to sign off for Facebook and YouTube right now so thank you so much for being here it was a very enlightening conversation and everybody must go out and read this book a man in his the political Odyssey of William F Buckley Jr by Alvin s Felsen berg thank you professor Felton Berg bitter pleasure Michael thank you alright that's pretty good we and we actually let that go a little bit longer on Facebook and YouTube and my Facebook and YouTube I of course just mean Facebook because YouTube hasn't let us on however since CNN started really pinging us well said okay if you're on Facebook please go to daily wire.com what do you get you get me you get the end work life and show you get the Ben Shapiro show you get them the mailbag you can ask questions we're just about to do that and we've got some very good ones in our last minutes here you get the conversation you can ask questions in the conversation everybody can watch but only subscribers can ask questions many are called but few were chosen but none of that matters what

makes me feel better when my allergies are kicking up or I've got a little bit of a cold and some nice salty delicious left is tears with honey in it you want to put a little bit of honey so you get the sweet and the savory it's a really really good way to have them if you're feeling a little fluish be sure to go to daily wired.com right now I'll be right back all right we in our last minutes here I know we're running a little bit late but we're gonna try to get some mailbag questions in and these guys are gonna tell me when I have to go first question from Brandon my mother is very religious and it seems like she can't have a regular conversation without bringing up the Lord I personally don't mind because I have a strong faith and enjoy the discussion however my two older brothers cringe and want to end the discussion as soon as it starts I wouldn't say they don't believe in God however it looks like God isn't really a priority in their lives I get along great with my brothers however I must never bring up the Lord with them and just talk about common interests my question is should I try to talk to them about God if so what's your advice in doing so knowing that they don't want to should I talk to my mom about dialing it back a little bit if so what's your advice I'm doing so great I would say I have a good friend in politics he has been major political operative and he's been an actor and some he's in the movie the Warriors that's the only clue I'll give you call classic and he's he's at a great career and he's also a devout born-again Christian and he told me when I asked him how it happened and he said well the Holy Spirit just came on me I said well what did you think when when that happened he said my first thought was oh god please don't let me become a Jesus Freak I sort of see what he means you know there are some people who every sentence they say is is proselytizing and there's a difference between evangelizing spreading the good news and proselytizing banging people over the head with it st. Francis of Assisi said preach the gospel and if you must speak there is on the subject of common interest you can always talk about that but of course one doesn't simply want to sit there and talk about the food oh good chicken isn't it yeah the chicken is good you you do want to talk about things that matter I think most people hate small talk the there was a study that came out a few years ago that the majority of people hate small talk so you want to bring it in there's no reason not to talk about your faith and the way you see the world st. Peter said you should always be prepared to give an explanation of the joy that's in your heart and so if they ask you about it you should be prepared to give them an answer but I wouldn't push them I wouldn't clobber them over the head in your own life I think people should be able to look at you and say wow there's something different about that guy wonder what it is and how do I get a piece of it so that that is what I would do I would evangelize but I wouldn't proselytize next question from Alex hey Michael I have a quick question regarding your personal journey back to the church universal I am currently an evangelical and I absolutely adore my church they helped me to understand who God is after I left the LDS faith however I did just attempt mass for the first time and the service pierced my soul I understand passages of Scripture in a completely new life and was completely taken in by the beauty of the Eucharist however I still love my church I feel like leaving them for the Catholic Church would be tantamount to betrayal so I'd like to know did you deal with similar feelings on your journey home and how did you overcome them of course yeah it was actually a number of Protestants brought me back to belief in God and Jesus and ultimately to the Catholic Church I and I totally see your point there is something about liturgy serious liturgy sober liturgy it is much fuller than the acoustic guitars and the electric guitars and you know like you're going to a cheap rock concert or something I certainly think so ah there I wouldn't call it a betrayal at all you you have you have to look toward the truth above all things if you have the sense that the Catholic Church is the church it is the church instituted by Christ and you its pierced your soul then go to that you can't doesn't mean you can't be friends with people you can still see all of your old evangelical pals and hang out with them I probably hang out with many more non Catholics than with Catholics and have more Jewish friends than you know Christian friends probably been wouldn't call himself my friends but I would call been my friend you know that's that's just a difference of nomenclature but you you don't need to worry about that you I would follow up follow your heart follow what you think is the truth the truth above all things if you look for truth you might find comfort in the end but if you look for comfort you'll find neither truth nor comfort only soft soap - and wishful thinking to begin and in the end despair that's a paraphrasing of CS Lewis and he's exactly right from Johnny what type of hair product is the trolls use leftist tears I use leftist tears because of the salt the salt content is just right so it allows your hair to maintain the right volume and the right poufiness and a little bit of rigidity but it's not too rigid and it just feels so good when you put them in next question from Samuel greetings and salutations Oh Knowles the Magnificent writer Bishop of The Daily wire usurper of titles and collector of leftist tears that is good that is a half of might of my titles very good use my question for you is this we're deeply divided it seems that the possibility of avoiding a second civil war is closing quickly how should we conduct our lives in these trying times when nearly every door is closing faster than we can reach them Samuel yes all we can do is trust in God that's true but you also want to you also want to make sure you're living in the world do you know trusting God above all things but you know if someone's gonna start shooting at you duck I'm not convinced that we're headed for a civil war because we're too apathetic we're not even cool enough for a civil war we're two like lazy and apathetic for them especially the left especially the left they don't even protest anymore they occupy they just sit and Occupy Wall Street and they were stupid hats and they say what do you want they say uh-huh say what are you doing our standing around I don't know so I wouldn't worry about that plus we have all the guns so I don't worry about that that doesn't worry me too much There is obviously a cultural civil war as as Dennis Prager puts it very well but in that war I think you got to fight it joyfully I think you have to fight that civil war not from the perspective of all these guys are gonna kill me I hate it I'm so miserable you have to fight it from the perspective of this cough FA feels so good pulsing for my veins and the leftist here's taste so delicious that I want to share that joy with everybody and I think that helps a lot too also because the lefties they're the ones that are angry and upset all the time and they're always screaming and they don't know anything and they don't know anything about history and they don't know anything about philosophy or literature so don't you don't want to be like them you're the one who can say look this is the way it is I've got a little bit more knowledge than you do perhaps and let me let me explain the world to you and we can share a just tumblr of leftist ears do we have to go or do I get one more we do one more oh my gosh my phone is even going off that's how late we're going we'll do one more from Luke hey Mike hope all is well is it true that most Catholics no longer participate in the practice of confession as a new Catholic convert what why should I tell a stranger my deepest darkest failures thanks and take care yeah it's really hard the confessional is a really tough one this is a good question and on a lot of people don't do it anymore the communion lines are long and the confession lines are short which tells you a lot about modern culture and maybe the sense of sin that people have one advertisement for the traditional Latin Mass is very frequently they have a confessional going during the mass so you get a twofer you get to go in and you get to confess your sins and then you get the Eucharist and you're in a state of grace oh you should tell a straight well it shouldn't be a stranger you should see your priest more than once you you you should know your priest but you should tell them your deepest darkest failures because he can forgive your sins you know Christ gives the apostles the the ability to forgive sins he says as my father sent me so I send to you as my father sent me to reconcile people to God so I send you to reconcile people to God Jesus says to the Apostles if you forgive sins their sins will be forgiven and if you retain people's sins their sins shall be retained so this isn't just a broad saying yes the sins are forgiven B just because of the the good news there's a this ethereal thing he is sending real people to do things in the Acts of the Apostles not just the words of the Apostles Christ's sacrifice is perfect his forgiveness is perfect and he says I send you to forgive sins what sins you forgive or forgiven what sins you retain are retained that's an important aspect obviously he also gives the Apostles the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven some people mistakenly think that confession is a product of the fourth Lateran Council in 1215 that isn't true the fourth Lateran council did codify aspects of the confession but only because they'd existed for over a millennium Saint John Chrysostom talks about the confession it's very good one because because of the scriptural basis for it but two because it's very hard and because it's very effective at bringing into reality making tangible that which is just ethereal so we know that Christ conquers death and conquers our sins but it's easy to forget that in the world you say okay it's just abstract hey I'm sorry okay maybe I'm forgiven there's something we're humans we have bodies we live in time and space there is something very difficult even now I've gone to confession a lot of times when you're standing in that line there's you think you have to grapple with your sin in a very palpable way and you get down on your knees and you have to tell another person your sins that as a way of grappling it is very palpable psychologically it's very helpful to do that but spiritually it's very helpful too because then a priest reiterates God's forgiveness he reiterates to you you you hear it it's a very palpable way of doing it and then you're in a state of grace I highly recommend it it's the laundry it's the dry cleaners for your souls it's there's a reason that it's a been a sacrament for a very long time I I highly recommend it and I wouldn't look at it as some obligation that you have to do I look at it as a sacrament as the unity of heaven and earth coming together in a moment of the unity of the symbol and the symbolized coming together in a moment and and reminding you of your forgiveness it's a really really wonderful sacrament and you should do it but don't tell me I don't want to hear about it tell your priest okay that's all the time we have for today please survive the weekend if you want if you want some more listen to Andrew clavin's another Kingdom
