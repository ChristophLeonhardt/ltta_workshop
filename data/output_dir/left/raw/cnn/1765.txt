a dangerous game of chicken as two
nuclear-armed leaders threatened to

destroy the other the war of words
between US president Donald Trump and

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,480
North Korean leader Kim jong-un is
beginning to shake even the most steady

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,529
of nerves recently Trump has rolled out
a new nickname for the North Korean

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,000
leader
Rocketman Kang jung-ho was a member of

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,930
the elite in North Korea and he worries
that mr. Trump crossed a line by getting

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,980
personal with Kim jong-un sparking the
first ever direct response from the

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,829
North Korean leader pledging Trump would
pay dearly for threatening his country

00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:38,969
Kim jong-un is a god-like figure says
Kang and if the godlike figure says such

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,680
things to the u.s. it's not just going
to stay at words it needs to be put into

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,600
action that's what makes this situation
serious after a trump tweet over the

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,320
weekend that the North says it
interprets as a u.s. declaration of war

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,309
foreign minister ryeong Ho said Monday
North Korea is now within its rights to

14
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,020
shoot down u.s. bombers even if they
aren't in their airspace on Saturday

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,939
u.s. b-1b bombers flew further north of
the DMZ than any other time this century

16
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,520
a show of force that sparked a
propaganda video on the North Korean web

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,729
site with crude edits to show the u.s.
bombers being destroyed the video

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,939
claimed to be posted by an officer of
the kPa and North Korean military some

defectors have joined forces to show mr.
Trump they support his hardline stance

20
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,110
on North Korea
at a recent protest they pledged to join

21
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,970
a war of liberation to eliminate Kim
jong-un the hatred for the leader of

22
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,250
their home country is hard to miss this
defector activist tells me

23
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,810
South Korea tried to talk then Pyongyang
did another nuclear test so we have no

24
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,790
choice but to physically fight but the
vast majority in the region if not the

25
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,580
world wants peace security de-escalation
before words spill over into something

26
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,560
else once you provoke if you deescalate
you're worried about losing face and so

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,220
you know the United States is backing
itself into a corner here the North

28
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,130
Koreans
can stay in that corner I mean they've

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,570
lived in that corner for 70 years so for
now the insults of flying the threats of
