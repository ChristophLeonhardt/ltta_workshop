as president Trump's third National Security Advisor gets ready to start work Jacqueline Vega explores how John Bolton looks likely to be the latest official to face scrutiny over alleged links to Russia in the latest installment of the revolving-door saga that's defined the Trump administration a third national security adviser is taking over John Bolton is an outspoken ultra hawk seen as an advocate of big stick diplomacy including when it comes to Russia Russians have walked all over the Obama administration for eight years it's really been a pathetic performance Putin is I think making a propaganda claim here and of course he's blaming us for this he's saying if you hadn't gotten out of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty I wouldn't have to do this that's complete nonsense and he knows it you've got to build up both our cyber offensive and defensive capabilities and create structures of deterrence so it doesn't happen again and how do you do that in this case you make the Russians feel pain so not exactly in line with Trump's enduring message of the benefits of getting along with Russia but maybe that means this is the one guy in the Trump administration who won't be accused of being a Kremlin puppet or not if we look back Boulton is not without connections to Russia and as we all know any hint of the wrong red white and blue flag is more than enough to string someone up in Washington now back in 2013 Bolton recorded a video for a Russian gun rights group encouraging Moscow to adopt something similar to America's Second Amendment we're the Russian national government to grant a broader right to bear arms to its people it would be creating a partnership with its citizens that would better allow for the protection of mothers children and families but given that Bolton was on the NRA's international affairs subcommittee at the time it's not all that surprising or sinister that however isn't stopping anyone from jumping to collusion conclusions now stay with me here the group that distributed the video was co-founded by Alexander tortion yes a Russian and the FBI is reportedly investigating whether tortion illegally funneled money to the NRA which in turn used the funds to support the Trump campaign and the Russian cherry on top is torsion is tied to the Kremlin and President Putin himself with connections like that the sure to be a huge scandal brewing and sadly for Bolton it gets worse he has appeared on our channel a number of times in the past and we all know what Washington thinks of us propaganda bullhorn RT television Buganda machine Russian propaganda in Russian propaganda machine propaganda machine this propaganda that's coming out of Russia Russian propaganda on steroids the internet isn't ignoring that possibly serious physical signs of where Bolton's loyalties truely lie either John Bolton's moustache is a Russian spy breaking John Bolton's mustache admits that it is a Russian spy Bolton's hair and moustache at different colors which makes him look like he's in disguise and just over two weeks Bolton will officially take over as Trump's national security adviser giving the media plenty of time to tease out any and all ties Bolton may have to Russia and speculate on exactly what they mean good luck guys legal and media analyst Lionel believes Bolton's appointment sends conflicting messages we started off with hawkish responsible bellicose saber rattling no let's be more circumspect it changes by the day I have to remind you of this one issue North Korea phase 1 President Trump won to choose one them we can annihilate you our button is bigger than your button we have more missiles than you do watch it phase 2 rep respond date on great let's meet terrific stage 3 let's bring in Bolton who wanted a preemptive strike if you can figure this up if you can see any pattern to this you're a better person than I am
