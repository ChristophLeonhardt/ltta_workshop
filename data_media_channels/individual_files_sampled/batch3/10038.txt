schools in the US state of Illinois might soon have to change their curriculums to teach more about the contributions made by the LGBT communities in US history the work of LGBT figures will be given more focus in subjects ranging from science to sport California made a similar move last year the bell still has to be given the go-ahead by the state's House of Representatives but it's already got plenty talking it will promote acceptance and more accurate portrayal of history it is in direct contradiction to the clear judeo-christian beliefs of many in Illinois to discuss the issue further we invited media commentator Gina Loudon and human rights activist Peter Tatchell to offer their views it's very important that people understand the contribution that gay people have made I think it's about informing straight kids so they understand LGBT issues they perhaps their prejudice is broken down if history book or any book would ever write about me personally I wouldn't want them to lead with my religious background my ethnicity and certainly not my sexual orientation fantastic extraordinary people from Tchaikovsky to richard the lionheart their gayness or their bisexuality is not the major factor but it's just about acknowledging that LGBT people have existed throughout history and have made a very important contribution to the sciences the arts sport and culture well I think in an effort perhaps to be inclusive we've made a mistake on a Mis estimation if you will and what's happened is that a lot of groups have been taken advantage of by politicians who are willing to prey on people based on those identities I think that you know identity politics has been a response to exclusion because of decades of exclusion and marginalization some communities have had to organize it hasn't worked and what it's done instead is its divided us up into little groups that then can be taken advantage of by politicians Jesus right we don't want to be typecast about the fact that we're Jewish or gay or black those are just one aspect of who we are but in some cases those are the aspects of who we are which other people target for hatred and discrimination my concern begins and ends where government gets involved in deciding who's relevant who's not relevant who is more relevant and then dividing us into little groups because when government has enough power to do that they also have enough power to take that away
