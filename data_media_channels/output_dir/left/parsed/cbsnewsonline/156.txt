ON JUNE 14th, WE CELEBRATE FLAG 
DAY. 
WE ALL PROUDLY STAND FOR. 
THE FOUNDING OF OUR BRAVE U.S. 
ARMY AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT 
LEAST WE WOULD LIKE TO WISH THE 
PRESIDENT A VERY, VERY HAPPY 
BIRTHDAY. 
AND IF I DO SAY SO, I DON'T 
THINK HE LOOKS A DAY OVER 35. 
WITH THAT, I'LL TAKE YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 
>> SARAH, THANK YOU. 
IF YOU WOULD PLEASE COMMENT ON 
THE RECENTLY RELEASED IG 
REPORT. ÃºYOUR IMPRESSIONS OF WH 
HAVE READ SO FAR. 
AND HAVE YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO DISCUSS WITH THE PRESIDENT 
THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL'S 
IDEA OF SUING THE TRUMP 
FOUNDATION TO HAVE IT SHUT DOWN 
IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED ON 
THE IG REPORT EARLIER TODAY. 
>>> AND IT REAFFIRMED THE 
PRESIDENT'S SUSPICIONS ABOUT 
COMEY'S CONDUCT AND THE 
POLITICAL BIAS AMONG SOME OF 
THE MEMBERS OF THE FBI. 
AS TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED ABOUT 
THIS. 
SPECIFICALLY EARLIER TODAY. 
THE FOUNDATION RAISED $18 
MILLION WHILE GIVING $19 
MILLION TO CHARITY WHILE 
VIRTUALLY HAVING ZERO EXPENSES. 
THE PREVIOUS NEW YORK AG WHO 
WAS FORCE TODAY RETIRE IN 
DISGRACE MADE ITS STATED 
MISSION TO ADVANCE HIS OWN 
POLITICAL GAIN AND THE CURRENT 
ACTING NEW YORK AG HAS STATED 
THAT BATTLING THE WHITE HOUSE 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB SHE 
HAS EVER DONE. 
THAT SOUNDS OUTRAGEOUSLY BIASED 
AND PROBLEMATIC. 
AND VERY CONCERNING. 
CECILIA. 
>> IN THE STATE OF THE UNION, 
THE PRESIDENT HAD HARSH WORDS 
FOR NORTH KOREA. 
HE SAID NO REGIME HAS OPPRESSED 
ITS OWN CITIZENS MORE BRUTALLY 
THAN NORTH KOREA. 
WHY IS HE NOW DOWNPLAYING NORTH 
KOREA'S HORRIFIC ATROCITIES. 
>> HE HAS NOT DOWNPLAYED. 
HE HAS RAIDED THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORDS AND SOME OF THE ABUSES 
OF THE REGIME ON A NUMBER OF 
OCCASIONS. 
HE RAISED THEM AT THE SUMMIT 
THAT TOOK PLACE EARLIER THIS 
WEEK. 
THE FOCUS WAS DENUCLEARIZATION 
AND THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF WHAT 
TOOK PLACE THERE. 
>> ON FOX NEWS HE SAID A LOT OF 
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE REALLY 
BAD THINGS. 
HOW IS THAT NOT DOWNPLAYING THE 
ATROCITIES. 
>> THAT IS A FACTUAL STATEMENT. 
PEOPLE HAVE DONE BAD THINGS. 
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T IGNORED 
THE BAD THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN 
DONE BY THE NORTH KOREAN 
REGIME. 
HE HAS DIRECTLY CALLED IT OUT 
ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AS YOU 
YOURSELF MENTIONED AND HE 
BROUGHT IT UP AT THE SUMMIT AND 
AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE SUMMIT 
WAS TO FOCUS ON 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND LOOKING 
TOWARDS THE BRIGHTER FUTURE. 
THAT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
TRYING TO DO. 
MARGARET. 
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM THERE IS A 
MEETING TODAY THAT THERE ARE 
CHINESE TARIFFS COMING 
TOMORROW. 
AND THERE WAS A REPORT THAT 
SOMEWHERE -- 
>> THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 
WE WILL GO ONE AT A TIME. 
FIRST YES THERE IS A TRADE 
MEETING TODAY. 
IN TERMS OF ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS, 
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED WHEN WE 
HAVE SOMETHING TO ANNOUNCE. 
>> THE THIRD PART OF MY 
QUESTION, THERE HAS BEEN A 
REPORT THAT 800 TO 900 CHINESE 
PRODUCTS WILL BE ON THE TARIFFS 
LIST. 
IT SEEMS LIKE QUITE A HIGH 
NUMBER, EVEN THOUGH I GUESS THE 
HIGHEST NUMBER IS 1300. 
IF THAT NUMBER IS HIGHER THAN 
IT REALLY IS, COULD YOU TELL US 
NOW? 
>> WELL, I'M NOT MAKING ANY 
ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO GIVE 
DETAILS OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT 
WE'RE NOT READY TO MAKE. 
WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL, WE WILL 
KEEP YOU POSTED. 
O NOTED THAT, I CAN'T GET INTO 
ANY DETAILS. 
>>> DAVID. 
>> TWO QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T 
MIND. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID EARLIER THIS 
WEEK THAT HE DID SPEAK WITH KIM 
JONG-UN ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSES. 
CAN YOU TELL US EXACTLY WHAT 
AREAS OF CONCERN THEY TALKED 
ABOUT? 
WAS IT THE WORK CAMPS, TORTURE, 
PUBLIC EXECUTIONS, THE LACK OF 
FREEDOM RELIGION, PRESS, 
WOMEN'S RIGHTS. 
WHAT DID THEY TALK ABOUT. 
>> THEY COVERED A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT TOPICS. 
A COUPLE THAT YOU LISTED. 
I'M NOT GOOD TO GET INTO ALL OF 
THE DETAILS OF THE PRIVATE 
CONVERSATION. 
BUT AS THE PRESIDENT HAS 
PUBLICLY STATED HE BROUGHT UP 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF THE 
NORTH KOREAN REGIME. 
>>> JIM. 
>> RUDY GIULIANI SPENT 20 
MINUTES TALKING ABOUT ONE OF 
OUR REPORTERS ABOUT HIS LOVE 
LIFE AND PROCLAIMED THAT HE IS 
NOT GOING TO BE A PRIEST IF HE 
IS SEPARATED FROM HIS THIRD 
WIFE. 
HAS THIS BECOME TOO BIG OF A 
DISTRACTS TO THE POINT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO GET 
ANOTHER LAWYER. 
AND ALSO ON THAT, HE SAID HIS 
SOON TO BE EX JUDITH CALLED THE 
PRESIDENT LAST WEEK. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THEY 
TALKED ABOUT. 
>> NOT TODAY OR TOMORROW OR ANY 
POINT GOING TO COMMENT ON RUDY 
GIULIANI'S LOVE LIFE. 
I WILL BE GLAD TO HE LEAVE THAT 
TO YOU AND THE REPORTER THAT 
SPOKE TO HIM. 
I'M NOT AWARE OF A CALL AND 
DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON 
THAT. 
JIM. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US WHY THE 
PRESIDENT SALUTED THE NASHS 
WHEN HE WAS IN SING -- THE 
NORTH KOREANS WHEN HE WAS IN 
SINGAPORE. 
>> IT A TRADITION. 
>> COMPLETELY UNRELATED ON THE 
CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM 
THEIR FAMILIES AS THEY COME 
ACROSS THE BORDER. 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EARLIER 
TODAY SAID THAT SOMEHOW THERE 
IS A JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS IN 
THE BIBLE. 
WHERE DOES IT SAY IN THE BIBLE 
THAT IT IS MORAL TO TAKE 
CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR 
MOTHERS? 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COMMENTS OR 
WHAT HE WOULD BE REFERENCING. 
I CAN SAY THAT IT IS VERY 
BIBLICAL TO ENFORCE THE LAW. 
THAT IS REPEATED A NUMBER OF 
TIMES THROUGHOUT THE BIBLE. 
HOLD ON, JIM. 
IF YOU WILL LET ME FINISH. 
AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT 
ON THE ATTORNEY'S COMMENTS THAT 
I HAVEN'T SEEN. 
>> YOU SAID IT IS IN THE BIBLE 
TO FOLLOW THE LAW. 
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. 
AND I KNOW IT IS HARD TO 
UNDERSTAND EVEN SHORT 
SENTENCES, I GUESS. 
DON'T TAKE MY WORDS OUT OF 
CONTEXT. 
BUT THE SEPARATION OF ALIEN 
FAMILIES IS THE PRODUCT OF THE 
SAME LEGAL LOOPHOLE THAT'S 
DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO CLOSE. 
AND THESE LAWS ARE THE SAME 
THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR 
OVER A DECADE. 
AND THE PRESIDENT IS SIMPLY 
ENFORCING THEM. 
>> TO TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM 
THEIR PARENTS. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE HORROR THAT 
THESE CHILDREN ARE GOING 
THROUGH. 
>> ENFORCE THE LAW. 
>> WHEN THEY COME ACROSS THE 
BORDER WITH THEIR PARENTS AND 
THEY'RE SUDDENLY PULLED AWAY 
FROM THEIR PARENTS? 
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING 
THIS. 
>> BECAUSE IT IS THE LAW AND 
THAT'S WHAT THE LAW STATES. 
>> YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE TO DO 
THAT. 
>> YOU'RE RIGHT. 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE LAW. 
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS ACTUALLY 
CALLED ON DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS 
TO FIX THE LOOPHOLES. 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED TO 
COME TO THE TABLE, FAILED TO 
HELP THIS PRESIDENT CLOSE THESE 
LOOPHOLES AND FIX THIS PROBLEM. 
WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A 
PROBLEM. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TRIED TO 
ADDRESS IT A NUMBER OF 
OCCASIONS. 
WE LAID OUT A PROPOSAL AND 
DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO DO THEIR 
JOB AND FIX THE PROBLEM. 
PAULA, GO AHEAD. 
>> SORRY, JIM. 
I GAVE YOU ENOUGH TIME. 
>> THERE IS NO LAW THAT 
REQUIRES THAT FAMILIES BE 
SEPARATED AT THE BORDER. 
THIS WAS THE ADMINISTRATION'S 
CHOICE TO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE 
PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THE 
BORDER ILLEGALLY AND SEPARATE 
FAMILY. 
WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION FIND 
THIS WAS NECESSARY AND IF IT 
DOES NOT HAVE AN EFFECT, WILL 
YOU CONTINUE THE POLICY. 
>> AGAIN, THE LAWS ARE THE ONE 
THAT'S HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS 
FOR OVER A DECADE AND THE 
PRESIDENT IS ENFORCING THEM. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO FIX THE BROKEN 
SYSTEM THAT OUR IMMIGRATION AND 
FIX OUR IMMIGRATION PROBLEM. 
HOWEVER, UNTIL DEMOCRATS ARE 
WILLING TO ACTUALLY FIX THIS 
PROBLEM IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE. 
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT 
FIXED. 
JILL. 
>> IT DOESN'T TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS POLICY 
CHANGE IN HANDLING THEM AS 
CIVIL MATTERS TO CRIMINAL. 
>> IT IS NOT A POLICY CHANGE TO 
ENFORCE THE LAW. 
THAT HAS BEEN THE 
ADMINISTRATION POLICY SINCE THE 
DAY WE GOT HERE. 
IT HAS BEEN OUR 
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY -- 
>> SAID IT WAS A DETERRENT. 
DETERRING PEOPLE FROM COMING 
HERE ILLEGALLY. 
>> OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD 
THE SAME POSITION SINCE WE 
STARTED ON DAY ONE THAT WE WERE 
GOING TO ENFORCE THE LAW. 
I KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING THAT 
WASN'T HIGH ON THE PRIORITY 
LIST IN THE PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
BUT IT IS ON OURS. 
WE'RE COUNTRY OF LAW AND ORDER 
AND ENFORCING THE LAW AND 
PROTECTING OUR BORDERS. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO FIX THE 
LOOPHOLES. 
IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO GET 
SERIOUS ABOUT IT, THEY'RE 
WELCOME TO COME AND SIT DOWN 
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 
>> DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY 
-- COME ON, SARAH. 
YOU'RE A PARENT. 
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY WHAT 
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. 
>> SETTLE DOWN. 
I'M TRYING TO BE SERIOUS. 
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU 
YELL OUT A TERM. 
>> THEY HAVE -- THESE PEOPLE 
HAVE NOTHING. 
>> BRIAN, I KNOW YOU WANT TO 
GET MORE TV TIME. 
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. 
GO AHEAD, JILL. 
>> ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
IT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION. 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING. 
THEY COME TO THE BORDER WITH 
NOTHING. 
AND YOU THROW CHILDREN IN 
CAGES. 
YOU'RE A PARENT. 
YOU'RE A PARENT OF YOUNG 
CHILDREN. 
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY FOR 
WHAT THEY GO THROUGH. 
>> JILL, GO AHEAD. 
>> TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT REALLY 
BELIEVE THAT IS PART OF RUSSIA 
BECAUSE PEOPLE SPEAK RUSSIAN. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT KIM 
JONG-UN -- 
>> LET ME ANSWER YOUR FIRST 
QUESTION. 
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY COMMENT 
LIKE THAT. 
I KNOW IT HAS BEEN REPORTED BUT 
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON A 
PRIVATE CONVERSATION THAT I 
WASN'T A PART OF. 
THAT I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION 
ON. 
THE SECOND PART. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT KIM 
JONG-UN TOLD HIM THAT NORTH 
KOREA WAS WORKING TO DESTROY A 
MAJOR MISSILE ENGINE TESTING 
SITE. 
IS THAT THE SOHAI SITE. 
>> WE WILL HAVE SPECIFIC 
DETAILS. 
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND WILL 
GET YOU THAT DEFENSE. 
>> EARLIER THIS YEAR THE 
PRESIDENT SUGGESTED THAT THE 
DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL HOROWITZ 
WAS, QUOTE, AN OBAMA GUY. 
HOW DOES THE PRESIDENT VIEW 
HOROWITZ TODAY AND DOES HE FEEL 
THIS INVESTIGATION WAS 
THOROUGH. 
>> AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT THINKS 
THAT THIS REPORT REAFFIRMS THE 
SUSPICIONS THAT HE HAD ABOUT 
COMEY. 
AND THE DIRECTOR WILL HOLD A 
PRESS CONFERENCE LATER TODAY 
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 
TUNE IN FOR THAT. 
>> THE TEXT MESSAGE BETWEEN 
PAGE AND STRUCK ULTIMATELY THE 
FBI AGENT STRUCK SAID WE WILL 
STOP IT AND HE WAS REFERRING TO 
CANDIDATE TRUMP BECOMING 
PRESIDENT. 
DID THE PRESIDENT HAVE ANY 
REACTION TO THIS INFORMATION 
WHEN YOU SPOKE WITH HIM AFTER 
HE WAS BRIEFED TODAY. 
>> CERTAINLY AGAIN CAUSES A 
GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN. 
AND I THINK POINTS OUT THE 
POLITICAL BIAS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT AND HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY 
MENTIONED FROM THIS 
ADMINISTRATION THAT WE FOUND TO 
BE A HUGE PROBLEM AND WE'RE 
GLAD THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT. 
>> SARAH, THANK YOU. 
DID THE PRESIDENT OR ANYONE 
ELSE USE FUNDS FROM THE TRUMP 
FOUNDATION TO PAY FOR PERSONAL 
BUSINESS OR CAMPAIGN EXPENSES. 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THAT 
TAKING PLACE. 
>> CAN YOU DEFINITIVELY SAY NO. 
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF IT. 
I WOULD HAVE TO GET MORE 
INFORMATION. 
BUT I WOULD REFER YOU TO THE 
TRUMP FOUNDATION FOR THAT 
SPECIFIC POINT. 
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT 
THAT SPECIFICALLY. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID SEVERAL 
MONTHS AGO HE DOESN'T THINK 
MICHAEL COHEN IS GOING TO FLIP. 
IS THAT STILL THE CASE. 
>> I'M SORRY. 
I DIDN'T HEAR THE LAST PART. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED 
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THAT HE 
DOESN'T THINK THAT COHEN IS 
GOING TO FLIP. 
DOES HE STILL THINK THAT IS THE 
CASE. 
>> I WOULD REFER YOU BACK TO 
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENT. 
JOHN. 
>> TWO QUESTIONS, SARAH. 
THANK YOU. 
FIRST, THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS 
ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS AND IN 
DETAIL ABOUT EPA HAD SCOTT 
PRUITT DOING THINGS THAT BORDER 
ON THE UNETHICAL AND ALMOST ON 
A DAILY BASIS REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CALLED FOR 
HIS RESIGNATION. 
WHAT IS HIS STATUS WITHIN THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND DOES THE 
PRESIDENT HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
HIM TO REMAIN AS ADMINISTRATOR? 
>> CERTAINLY WE HAVE SOME AREAS 
OF CONCERN AND SOME OF THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY PERSONNEL 
ANNOUNCEMENTS AT THIS POINT. 
>> MY SECOND QUESTION IS, 
CONGRESSMAN MARK SANFORD BLAMED 
THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET AS THE 
FINAL STRAW IN HIS DEFEAT, 
MAKING HIM THE SECOND 
REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBER TO GO 
DOWN IN DEFEAT. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN 48 
YEARS A SITTING PRESIDENT HAS 
OPPOSED A MEMBER OF CONGRESS OF 
HIS OWN PARTY. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT INTEND TO 
SPEAK OUT FOR PRIMARY 
CHALLENGES TO OTHER CRITICS OF 
HIM WITHIN THE CONGRESS? 
AND IF SO, WHO? 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY 
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ANY CANDIDATES 
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY OR MAY 
NOT ENDORSE AND WOULDN'T BE 
ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT FROM THIS 
VENUE EITHER. 
>> SORRY. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
I'LL COME BACK TO YOU. 
>> TWO QUESTIONS. 
FIRST, ON THE TWO IMMIGRATION 
BILLS THAT THE HOUSE IS 
CONSIDERING, DOES THE PRESIDENT 
HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OVER 
THE OTHER OR ARE BOTH JUST FINE 
WITH HIM? 
AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ONE. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY 
LAID OUT A PROPOSAL THAT CLOSES 
THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES AND 
PROVIDES THE RESOURCES TO 
SECURE OUR BORDER. 
IF THE PROCESS LEADS TO A 
EMERGENCY ROOM APPROXIMATE 
MENTAL SOLUTION AS OUTLINED BY 
THE PRESIDENT WE WOULD SUPPORT 
IT. 
>> HAS HE LOOKED AT IT. 
>> WE LAID OUT TO WHAT WE WANT 
TO SEE. 
IF IT LEADS TO A PERMANENT 
SOLUTION, WE WOULD SUPPORT. 
>> YOU BLAME THE DEMOCRATS FOR 
NOT CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES. 
REPUBLICANS CONTROL BOTH 
HOUSES. 
THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT. 
SO DON'T REPUBLICANS TAKE SOME 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
>> IF A HANDFUL OF DEMOCRATS 
WANTED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, 
WE COULD QUICKLY GET IT DONE. 
BUT THEY DON'T. 
AND THEY HAVE REFUSE TODAY COME 
TO THE TABLE AND ACTUALLY BE 
PART OF A SOLUTION INSTEAD OF 
JUST PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES 
AND ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT? 
THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED 
NUMEROUS TIMES TO GET RID OF 
THE FILIBUSTER. 
>> THERE ARE A MAJORITY OF 
REPUBLICAN SUPPORTING FIXING 
THE LOOPHOLES. 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO LOOK AT 
THEM. 
WE LAID OUT A PROPOSE TOTAL TO 
DO THAT AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT 
CONGRESS, PARTICULARLY 
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WILL COME 
TOGETHER AND ACTUALLY FIX THE 
SYSTEM. 
>> SO REPUBLICANS TAKE TO 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS AT THE 
BORDER. 
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO FIX 
IT. 
WE HAVE LAID OUT A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT PLANS AND PROPOSALS 
THAT WOULD CLOSE THESE 
LOOPHOLES AND WE CONTINUE TO BE 
READY AND WILLING TO WORK WITH 
CONGRESS TO GET IT DONE. 
>> TWO QUESTIONS. 
ON IMMIGRATION, WHAT DOES THE 
PRESIDENT WANT TO SEE THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES DO IN THE 
NEXT WEEK? 
>> AGAIN, WE HAVE LAID THAT 
OUT. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A 
PERMANENT SOLUTION TO FIX THE 
LOOPHOLES AND SECURE THE 
BORDER. 
>> ON DACA. 
JUST ON THE UPCOMING VOTES, IS 
THERE A PARTICULAR BILL THAT HE 
FAVORS. 
>> AGAIN, HE WANTS TO SEE ALL 
OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS 
THAT WE LAID OUT SEVERAL MONTHS 
AGO ADDRESSED. 
AND IF ANY OF THE LEGISLATION 
COMES TO THE TABLE THAT WOULD 
CREATE A PERMANENT SOLUTION 
THAT DOES THAT, THEN WE WOULD 
SUPPORT IT. 
>> ON THAT, THE PRESIDENT'S 
THREAT OF TARIFFS, DOES THAT 
MEAN THAT HE WILL WITHDRAW FROM 
NAFTA IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS. 
>> SEVERAL GOP LAWMAKERS TODAY 
HAVE CALLED FOR A SECOND 
SPECIAL COUNSEL. 
WOULD THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT A 
DEVELOPED INQUIRY INTO THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT AND 
THE FURTHER CONDUCT OF THE FBI 
OR DOES THIS SETTLE THE MATTER 
FOR ALL TIME. 
>> THIS CREATES A GREAT DEAL OF 
CONCERN. 
WE'RE GOING TO TUNE INTO THE 
DIRECTOR'S COMMENTS THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
CERTAINLY THERE ARE A LOT OF 
THINGS IN THE REPORT THAT NOT 
ONLY WORRY THOSE OF US IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION BUT SHOULD WORRY 
AMERICANS THAT IT WAS INJECTED 
INTO A DEPARTMENT THAT 
SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY BIAS. 
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE 
THAT PETER STRUCK SHOULD STILL 
HAVE A JOB AT THE FBI. 
>> I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM THAT 
QUESTION BUT I WOULD GUESS NO. 
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
THAT ARE REPORTEDLY EYEING THE 
EXITS INCLUDING YOURSELF. 
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT 
TO EXPECT? 
ARE ANY OF THOSE OFFICIALS 
LEAVING AND WHAT IS THE PLAN TO 
REPLACE THE HIGH LEVEL PEOPLE. 
>> THERE IS NOT A NEED TO 
REPLACE THEM. 
AS I STATED LAST NIGHT IN A 
TWEET, I THINK CBS GOT A LITTLE 
AHEAD OF THEIR SKIS, 
PARTICULARLY SINCE THEY PUT OUT 
A STORY ABOUT MY THINKING 
WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY TALKING 
TO ME. 
IT SEEMS IT WOULD BE A LITTLE 
PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF 
PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
I DON'T HAVE ANY TO MAKE. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I SHOW UP 
HERE EVERY DAY. 
I LOVE MY JOB. 
I'M GLAD TO WORK FOR THE 
PRESIDENT. 
AND EACH AND EVERY DAY I'LL 
PRAY FOR CLARITY AND 
DISCERNMENT ON WHAT MY FUTURE 
LOOKS LIKE. 
RIGHT NOW I THINK THE COUNTRY 
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD AND I'M GLAD 
TO BE A PART OF THAT PROCESS 
AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO 
MY JOB. 
THANKS SO MUCH, GUYS. 
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 
>> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS PRESS 
SECRETARY THERE SAYING SHE IS 
PRAYING FOR CLARITY AND 
DISCERNMENT AS SHE DETERMINES 
HER FUTURE THERE BUT WOULDN'T 
FOLLOW UP ON THE REPORTS THAT 
CBS HAS BEEN REPORTING THAT SHE 
AND HER COLLEAGUE RAJ SHAH MAY 
BE HEADING FOR THE EXIT DOORS 
SOON. 
BUT THE BIG REALLY OVERARCHING 
STORY TODAY IS THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL'S REPORT THAT WAS 
RELEASED CONDEMNING THE FBI AND 
THE WAY THAT FORMER FBI 
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY HANDLED 
THE CLINTON CASE. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
TAKEN ON IMMIGRATION. 
THE PRESS SECRETARY SAYING THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS A PERMANENT 
SOLUTION ON IMMIGRATION AND THE 
CRISIS THERE. 
BUT REALLY THE BIG FOCUS TODAY 
IS EXACTLY HOW THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL'S REPORT WAS RECEIVED. 
IT REAFFIRMED SHE SAYS, SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS, THE 
PRESIDENT'S SUSPICIONS ABOUT 
COMEY'S CONDUCT AND THE 
POLITICAL BIAS OF THE FBI. 
THAT WAS THEIR TAKE-AWAY. 
WE'RE FOLLOWING JAMES COMEY WHO 
RELEASED AN OPINION REPORT A 
SHORT TIME AGO ON THE NEW YORK 
TIMES SAYING THIS REPORT, THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WAS 
WRONG BUT IT WAS GOOD FOR THE 
FBI. 
PAUL A I WANT TO BRING -- I 
WANT TO BRING IN PAULA REID. 
I WANT TO START OFF WITH THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. 
GIVE US A SENSE OF RECAPPING 
THE WHITE HOUSE'S POSITION AND 
WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THEIR 
TAKE TODAY. 
>> NO. 
THEY TRIED TO ARGUE THIS REPORT 
VINDICATED THE PRESIDENT'S 
CONCERNS ABOUT CERTAIN PEOPLE 
WITHIN THE FBI AND HOW THEY 
HANDLE THE BOTH THE 
INVESTIGATION OF THE PRIVATE E-
MAIL SERVER OF HILLARY CLINTON 
AND THE ORIGINS OF THE RUSSIA 
PROBE. 
THAT IS NOT TRUE. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS CLAIMED THAT 
THE INVESTIGATION WAS BOTCHED 
OR RIGGED BUT THE OFFICE OF THE 
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT 
BIAS DID NOT IMPACT THE CLINTON 
INVESTIGATION. 
THAT HER INTERVIEW BY THE FBI 
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
ATTORNEYS HAVE REPEATEDLY 
CRITICIZED THEY FOUND IT WAS 
APPROPRIATE AND THERE WAS TRULY 
NO MR.IBLE CASE AGAINST HER. 
THE WHITE HOUSE'S SPIN TODAY IS 
THAT THE OIG REPORTS VIN DID I 
RATES THE PRESIDENT -- 
VINDICATES THE PRESIDENT'S 
POSITION BUT IT IS THE 
OPPOSITE. 
>> THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM 
THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER. 
A REPORTER PRESSED HER ON 
SAYING YOU'RE A PARENT. 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS. 
THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION 
WE'RE TRYING TO GET AND SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS SAYING THE 
PRESIDENT IS JUST ENFORCING THE 
LAW OF THE COUNTRY. 
FIRST AVENUE, IS IT THE LAW OF 
THE COUNTRY TO SEPARATE AND 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE ON HER 
RESPONSE ON IMMIGRATION TODAY. 
>> LET'S BE CLEAR. 
THE LAW OF THE LAND DOES NOT 
REQUIRE THAT YOU SEPARATE 
PARENTS AND CHILDREN AT THE 
BORDER. 
THE CHANGE THAT HAS BEEN MADE 
BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS 
THAT THEY HAVE DECIDED THEY ARE 
GOING TO PROSECUTE EVERYONE WHO 
IS APPREHENDED BY THE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
THAT CROSSES THE BORDER I 
WILLLY. 
WHEN YOU PROSECUTE ANYONE IN 
THIS COUNTRY, YOU ARE SEPARATED 
FROM YOUR CHILDREN. 
THAT IS A POLICY CHANGE THAT 
THE ADMINISTRATION MADE BACK IN 
APRIL. 
BEFORE THAT, THESE ILLEGAL 
BORDER CROSSINGS WERE TYPICALLY 
HANDLED AS CIVIL MATTERS. 
YOU WERE CITED AND GIVEN A 
COURT DATE AND SOMETIMES YOU 
WERE DETAINED. 
THERE WAS A CHANGE HOW THE 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION APPROACHED 
THIS. 
THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY THEY ARE 
ENFORCING THE LAW AND THIS IS 
THE FAULT OF THE DEMOCRATS. 
WHAT REPORTERS WERE TRYING TO 
GET AT, DOES THE ADMINISTRATION 
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OWN 
POLICY AND WHAT THIS IS DOING 
TO FAMILIES AT THE BORDER? 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY CHIEF HAS SAID ON THE 
RECORD THEY ARE DOING THIS AS A 
DETERRENT TO DETER PEOPLE FROM 
COMING HERE ILLEGALLY. 
AGAIN THERE, HAVE NOTHING 
ILLEGAL ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING. 
IT SEEMS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EFFECT 
OF THIS POLICY CHANGE. 
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO 
GET AT. 
SOMEONE TRIED TO PLAY ON THE 
FACT THAT SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS IS A MOTHER. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY EMPATHY, DO YOU 
HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS 
POLICY? 
SHE WASN'T BITING. 
SHE KEPT FALLING BACK ON THE 
TALKING POINTS WHICH THIS IS 
THE LAW OF THE LAND AND THEY 
WILL ENFORCE IT UNTIL DEMOCRATS 
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 
THIS IS A POLICY DECISION BY 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO 
APPROACH ILLEGAL BORDER 
CROSSINGS AS CRIMINAL MATTERS. 
NOW A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS 
WILL BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT IS A CRIME 
THAT NEEDS TO BE PROSECUTED. 
SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTY 
WITH THE MORALITY OF SEPARATING 
PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN. 
>> I WANT TO ALSO ASK YOU, SHE 
CAME FORWARD ABOUT EPA SCOTT 
PRUITT WHO HAS A HOST OF 
ALLEGATIONS AROUND HIM. 
SHE SAID THEY MAY HAVE 
CONCERNS. 
IS THAT A CHANGE FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE'S TAKE? 
WHAT DID YOU TAKE FROM THAT. 
>> I WOULD DESCRIBE THAT AS A 
MICRO CHANGE, A MICRO MOVEMENT 
IN THEIR HISTORICALLY PRETTY 
ROBUST DEFENSE OF THE EPA 
CHIEF. 
HE HAS A LAUNDRY LIST OF 
INVESTIGATIONS AND 
CONTROVERSIES. 
THE GENERAL QUESTION IS WHAT 
DOES IT TAKE TO GET FIRED. 
SO FAR THEY SAY THEY HAVE NO 
PERSONNEL ANNOUNCEMENTS BUT 
THEY SEEM TO BE MOVING, EVEN 
JUST A LITTLE BIT, TO BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE THINGS 
RAISED ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR. 
>> SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT CBS'S 
ORIGINAL REPORTING LAST NIGHT 
THAT SHE MAY AND HER COLLEAGUE 
MAY BE LEAVING AT SOME POINT. 
SHE DIDN'T DENY IT. 
>> SHE DID NOT DENY IT. 
SHE TOOK SOME CHEAP SHOTS AT 
OUR COLLEAGUE WHO BROKE THAT 
STORY WHO HAD THAT SCOOP. 
SHE TRIED TO SUGGEST THAT SHE 
WAS OUT OVER HER SKIS BUT SHE 
DID NOT DENY IT. 
SHE S
