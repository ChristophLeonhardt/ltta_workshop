1
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:44,330
the chair wishes to mark the return to
the chamber of our dear friend and

2
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,390
colleague from Louisiana mr. Steve
Scalise

3
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,100
our prayers have been answered his
bravery and his family strength had been

4
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,970
such an inspiration to this house and to
the people it serves America is grateful

5
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,720
for this moment the chair now proudly
asks for what purpose does the gentleman

6
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,800
from Louisiana seek recognition

7
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,660
the gentleman is recognized for as much
time as he may consume oh well thank you

8
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:17,890
mr. speaker you have no idea how great
this feels to be back here at work in

9
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,730
the people's house

10
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,830
as you can imagine these last three and
a half months have been pretty

11
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,400
challenging times for me and my family
but if you look at the outpouring of

12
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:44,550
love of warmth of prayer my gosh
Jennifer and I've been overwhelmed with

13
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,450
all of that outpouring and it's given us
the strength to get through all of this

14
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:55,010
and to get to this point today and it
starts with God

15
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:08,020
when I was laying out on that ball field
the first thing I did once I was down

16
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,090
and I couldn't move anymore as I just
started to pray and I will tell you it

17
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,800
gave me an unbelievable sense of calm
knowing that at that point it was in

18
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:25,240
God's hands but I prayed for very
specific things and I'll tell you pretty

19
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,439
much every one of those prayers was
answered and and they were some pretty

20
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,979
challenging prayers I was putting in
God's hands but he he really did deliver

21
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,889
for me and my family and it just gives
you that renewed faith in understanding

22
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:47,280
that the power prayer is something that
you just cannot underestimate

23
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:02,210
so I am definitely a living example that
miracles really do happen the first

24
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,710
place I want to go to to thank true
angels along the way starts with the

25
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,970
United States Capitol Police

26
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,360
when I was elected Majority Whip as you
know the elected leadership has a

27
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,990
security detail and if anybody ever
wondered why we're signed security

28
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,710
detail
I surely found out that day and let me

29
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:05,840
tell you I want to specifically mention
crystal Greiner and David Bailey

30
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:38,449
crystal and David were signed to my
security detail that morning and day in

31
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,509
and day out they're they're part of our
family Jennifer and I truly do treat him

32
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,410
as part of our family because they're
with us everywhere we go and on that day

33
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,840
it was no different On June 14th
they came 6:30 in the morning we arrived

34
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,580
at the baseball field just to play and
practice for a game of charity baseball

35
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,940
and nobody would have suspected what
ensued and yet as soon as those shots

36
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,919
were fired I'll tell you when I was
laying on the ground one of the things I

37
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,949
prayed for is that David and crystal
would be successful in carrying out

38
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,440
their duties and both David and crystal
are incredibly well trained incredibly

39
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,789
for professional but when I was laying
there not long after the first couple of

40
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:25,340
shots were fired
I could hear a different caliber weapon

41
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,210
and that told me that they had
immediately engaged the shooter and let

42
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,039
me tell you if they didn't act so
quickly and even after being shot both

43
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,690
themselves continued to engage the
shooter and ultimately got him down

44
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,159
which not only saved my life but saved
the life of a lot of other people that

45
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,270
are here in this chamber today crystal
couldn't be with us today but David

46
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,070
Bailey is with us David you are my hero
you saved my life and everything thank

47
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,580
you so much

48
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:25,209
Thanks
Tiger blood I also think those thanks to

49
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,930
a lot of the people that were on the
field with me right after the shooter

50
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,060
was down a lot of my colleagues came and
ran to come check on me and one I want

51
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,800
to mention in particular is one of those
things that Jennifer and I call the the

52
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,259
little miracles that happened that day
and throughout the next few months of

53
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:50,259
our recovery happen to have Brad
Wenstrup on the field that day and he

54
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:54,069
was one of the first to come to my side
and as you know Brad's not only a doctor

55
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:59,499
but he's a decorated Army Ranger who
served in combat in one of his roles and

56
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:03,910
missions was to take care of people that
were wounded before they went off on the

57
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,319
helicopter to go get prepared who would
have thought that God would have put

58
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:12,579
Brad out there on that field with me
because the tourniquet he applied many

59
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:17,439
will tell you save my life so that I can
actually make it to the hospital in time

60
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:21,360
with all the blood loss so Brad where
you at

61
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,280
once I arrived at MedStar Hospital I was
a little bit out of it at that point but

62
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,360
luckily I ended up in the trusted hands
of dr. Jack Sava and his great team over

63
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,380
at MedStar they gave me a second chance
at life and through many many surgeries

64
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,340
where my life was truly in the balance a
few of those they did a wonderful job at

65
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,480
making sure that I was well taken care
of and ultimately made it through that

66
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,550
point so I could get to dr. golden and
his team who actually put me back

67
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,200
together again which was quite a task to
the point where I'm actually able to

68
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,460
relearn how to walk again
so I doctored dr. Sava dr. golden thank

69
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,870
you for being here and thanks for your
team

70
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:03,600
above all else I want to thank my lovely
wife Jennifer

71
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:33,170
those who know or know how strong
Jennifer is she's an incredibly warm and

72
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,300
loving wife and she's an incredible
mother to our children and somehow

73
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,019
through the late nights and the
surgeries and all the other things she

74
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,129
managed to hold our family together to
make sure that Harrison and Madison were

75
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:50,990
cared for as well and still to this day
she's not only by my side but she's also

76
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,370
serving as a great mother I am lucky to
have you thanks for being here love you

77
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,610
sweetheart

78
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,820
and while it's been a challenge in time
for my family the thing that really

79
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:14,060
overwhelmed us from the start was the
outpouring of love and warmth and

80
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,030
prayers from Southeast Louisiana the
district that I represent we saw blood

81
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:25,280
drives at st. Catherine we saw prayer
groups at First United Methodist Church

82
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:33,020
in Slidell but what we also saw were
prayer groups and well-wishes being

83
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,260
given from people that we'd never met
before throughout all of your districts

84
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,480
and you shared it with me and it was one
of those things that was hard for us to

85
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,940
completely comprehend that you had
people from all walks of life that had

86
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,620
never met me before and yet they saw
what had happened and they just wanted

87
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,240
to offer prayers and let me tell you -
each and every one of you and please

88
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,570
convey it to your constituents and I
sure convey it to my constituents back

89
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:05,420
home that warmth and love gave us just
incredible strength that you can't

90
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,980
imagine during some really really
difficult times and so that is one more

91
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,770
example of the power of Prayer something
else I saw firsthand wasn't a surprise

92
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,990
to me but it was the outpouring of love
from you my colleagues both Republican

93
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:27,290
and Democrat I know right after the
shooting we were practicing on the

94
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,880
Republican side the Democrats were
practicing too and my colleague and

95
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,870
friend and sometimes archrival in
baseball from back home in New Orleans

96
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,300
unfortunately the star of the game too
many times Cedric Richmond somehow

97
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,980
figured out which hospital I was sent to
and got there probably the first person

98
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,780
there on the scene in his baseball
uniform to check on me so many others of

99
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,060
you again both Republican and Democrat
reached out in ways that I can't express

100
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,430
the gratitude and how much it means to
me Jennifer and our whole family it

101
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,230
really does show the warm side of
Congress that very few people get to see

102
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,800
and so I want to thank each and every
one of you for that you don't know how

103
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,330
much it meant to me and when I come back
into this chamber here today it just see

104
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,440
in the faces of all of you
it just means more to me than you can

105
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,830
imagine so thanks for all of that love
and support Oh

106
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,630
a lot of people ask did this event
change you and I think those you who

107
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,589
know me know I'm a I'm an optimistic
person I'm you know just a fun-loving

108
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,550
person I'm from south Louisiana and we
believe you work hard and you play hard

109
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,130
and Jawad 2:v is an event like this
gonna really change that and and the

110
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,269
first thing I can tell you is yes it
changed me but not in the ways you might

111
00:15:54,269 --> 00:16:00,800
think it's it's only strengthened my
faith in God and it's really

112
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,740
crystallized what what shows up is the
goodness in people I got to see that

113
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,839
goodness in people and so while some
people might focus on a tragic event and

114
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:19,050
an evil act to me all I remember are the
thousands of acts of kindness and love

115
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,920
and warmth that came out of this and
kept me going through all of it and

116
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,170
again just re-emphasize just how
wonderful most people are and how how

117
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:34,680
much compassion there is out there and
finally I want to talk about something

118
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,260
that I guess hit me and probably struck
me more than anything that I was not

119
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,199
expecting and that was the outpouring of
love and support from world leaders

120
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,800
people have met and have known you
Benjamin Netanyahu and I have had some

121
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,820
incredible conversations from the
hospital the Theresa Mamie reached out

122
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,920
the King Abdullah of Jordan who so many
of us have met reached out but other

123
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:05,220
world leaders also reached out people I
had never met before and that touched me

124
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,439
in a different way because each and
every one of us we come here and and we

125
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,000
fight for the things that we believe in
I have passionate beliefs for some

126
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,860
reason some of you don't agree with all
of those

127
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,449
but it's so important that we come up
here we are the people's house this is

128
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,589
the place where these ideas are supposed
to be debated and we fight through those

129
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:34,250
issues but ultimately we come together
on whatever the board shows is 218 if

130
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,690
you can put the majority together
that's what rules the day it's so

131
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,919
important that is we're having those
political battles we don't make them

132
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,269
personal because one of the things I saw
and I guess this is the thing that that

133
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,960
really kept coming back to me as I try
to to make sense of all this and

134
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,720
comprehend the outpouring of love that I
saw it kept coming back to those world

135
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,590
leaders you know why would leaders from
around the world that I'd never met

136
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,970
before reach out and say Steve we hope
you can get back to work we hope you can

137
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:11,059
come through this and what it says is
sure they cared about my well-being but

138
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,870
more than that they saw this as an
attack on all of us they saw this as an

139
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,950
attack on the institution of the United
States Congress and our government and

140
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,990
they really count on us to be successful
look we all know the United States is

141
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,200
the leader of the free world it's
something that we've frankly had the

142
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,799
honor as a country to hold as a
distinction for generations and yet when

143
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:36,769
you look at that title what it really
means is that there are people all

144
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:41,929
around the world that want freedom maybe
that have freedom but they know the

145
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:46,460
United States being strong is critical
to the rest of the world having the

146
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,510
opportunity for freedom

147
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,780
but that's why I'm so excited to be back
because as we're fighting through the

148
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,090
issues of the day let's just keep in
mind that we rise above the challenges

149
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,350
of the day and understand that it's not
just us in our constituents and the

150
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,400
country the United States that's
counting on us being successful people

151
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,549
all around the world that believe in
freedom are counting on us as well and

152
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,480
we will deliver for them that's why I am
so honored to be back here in the house

153
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,230
serving with you god bless each and
every one of you and god bless the

154
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,580
