00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,909
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone hope all is well today I</font>

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,730
wanted to talk about cheating how does

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,970
one deal with those that sheet because

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,030
in life we will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maintain our</font>

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,210
integrity we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest but there</font>

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there that are just a bit</font>

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,460
careless they don't think about others

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,039
and so when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going about doing</font>

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,680
what they do they will just keep cutting

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,920
corners and I know there are many people

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,900
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there who just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a good</font>

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,690
game of Monopoly so how do you deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,270
cheaters okay I'm not talking about

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:45,960
board games I'm someone who has only had

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,789
one relationship in my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that is is because I would never</font>

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,710
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into a relationship until my</font>

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,960
heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> was truly there in the case of my</font>

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,690
ex I know it for two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did very</font>

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,930
far away in Seattle and I flew out see

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,670
her a couple of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got him well</font>

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,840
and it was only when<font color="#E5E5E5"> she came to live</font>

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,060
with me and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> family in the UK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,830
started dating I lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> virginity to</font>

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,100
her and a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later she cheated</font>

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">ivor was really bad in bed or when I got</font>

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,950
to live in the UK she realized I wasn't

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,540
the only one with a British accent and

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,799
so went off with someone else so anyway

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,689
I have caused felt very bitter at the

31
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">time it totally shook up my perceptions</font>

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,939
I was someone who always thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

33
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,720
were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only ones that could be</font>

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,299
scumbags when it turns out also girls

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,189
can be and I did get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over it I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

36
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought I would at the time but I have</font>

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,640
learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process when I'm</font>

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,460
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good friends with a girl and she</font>

39
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,159
then gets into a relationship there are

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,200
quite a few times<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,360
completely back out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> friendship</font>

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we can't talk that much anymore the</font>

43
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,570
boyfriend doesn't want us hanging out

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,360
they are insecure they've been cheated

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,630
on previously and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> first I always feel</font>

46
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,930
like yeah I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that totally get</font>

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,780
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about my own</font>

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,820
experiences my ex I gave her all the

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,209
freedom to do whatever she wanted and I

50
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">think if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was ever in a relationship</font>

51
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">again would I become overprotective</font>

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,690
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized no I wouldn't I would</font>

53
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,909
give my partner<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the freedom she</font>

54
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,200
wants because if they're the right

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,140
person they'll stay faithful if you're

56
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,629
in a relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're being extra</font>

57
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,450
clingy you want to put boundaries and

58
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,310
what they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you may find that you</font>

59
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,340
end up pushing them further away now one

60
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,530
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is why do people cheat</font>

61
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,849
perhaps it was a drunk night a poor cool

62
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,390
of judgment perhaps they weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeling</font>

63
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,129
strongly about the relationship anymore

64
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:47,470
because ultimately we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are biological</font>

65
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,799
machines now that's not to say the

66
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,370
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is the victim of cheating</font>

67
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,599
it's your fault because the relationship

68
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,819
wasn't good enough they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have had</font>

69
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,440
their heart in it but it's because the

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,900
cheetah was never honest from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word</font>

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,019
go and so I feel when it comes to

72
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationships how can you ever possibly</font>

73
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">be sure another aspect of this I find</font>

74
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,650
really interesting is the third party so

75
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,340
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone was to cheat on me is the</font>

76
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,530
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> they sleep with also responsible</font>

77
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,150
if they are knowing of the situation I

78
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,590
personally feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is yes</font>

79
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,940
because they are aware and seduction

80
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,599
works both ways no matter how pushy the

81
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,790
cheater may be and to anyone who has

82
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,220
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> experienced a break up or is</font>

83
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,440
perhaps even in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,380
with someone they know has cheated on

85
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,709
them I know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely not easy and</font>

86
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,480
it becomes a huge battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your heart</font>

87
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,370
verse mind your heart will still care

88
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,980
about this person until perhaps it gets

89
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,200
so extreme that your mind overrides it

90
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,760
and goes what a scumbag but my last

91
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,269
piece of advice is this that if if the

92
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">person turns out not to be the person</font>

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,449
you fell in<font color="#CCCCCC"> love with if they turned out</font>

94
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,760
not to be faithful<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact you have</font>

95
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,709
found out they're cheating means you

96
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,620
have an opportunity now<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change your</font>

97
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,449
life you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to sever</font>

98
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ties and look in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

99
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,460
direction and realize there's a whole

100
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,980
world out there of many great people

101
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,450
that will treat you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the love and</font>

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,060
