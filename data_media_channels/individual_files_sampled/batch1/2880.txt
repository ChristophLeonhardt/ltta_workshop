the suggestion that I participated in any collusion that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country which I have served with honor for 35 years or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process isn't an appalling and detestable life I did not have any private meetings no other do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel I did not attend any meetings at that event separate proud of the speech attended by the president today I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and president Trump I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States further I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign following a routine morning threat briefing mr. Comey spoke to me in my chief of staff while he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the president apparently the day before mr. Comey expressed concern about proper communications protocol with the White House and with the president I responded he didn't recall this but I will I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and the Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House i recused myself from any investigation into the campaign for president but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations these false false attacks any windows the leaks you can be sure will not intimidate me
