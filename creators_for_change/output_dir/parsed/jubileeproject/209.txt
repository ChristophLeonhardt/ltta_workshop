I heard a lot about Hosea story you know
which reminds me a lot of my story I
just want to be an encouragement to him
today I get to know him a little bit
spend some time with him hang out

efecto demasiado I was 13 when I had my
first drink it was at a party I was
always a shy kid and it gave me the
courage to actually you know talk to
girls I like that confidence and so I
wanted it more of it more of it that's
when I started getting hooked on to it
when I think about him I get emotional
because right outside his door
homelessness drugs in his face offered
to him
they seem on the corner I've seen him
you know make the wrong choices
December 8th 2010 it started off as a
normal day we went to a party we brought
alcohol they brought weed
never had I mixed drugs with alcohol but
at the moment I got in care when got
drunk I messed up
and when the party ended I remember
walking outside as soon as I opened the
door everything slowed down
every time I close my eyes I saw a
bright light
I was slowly giving into it
the paramedics rushed in and I saw my
mom for the first time it seemed as if
she saw her son dead my heart just
pretty much shut to pieces

fire for my action I could have lost
everything
I'm on most importantly
and white there was when it hit me that
I was born the wrong way
so I knew Jose for nine years now as a
teacher and a coach all he thought about
was basketball his second life every
time I stepped on the court like my mind
we just go blank and I just focus on
what's ahead of me drinking or smoking
whatever it was I didn't need all that I
just needed a ball and a hoop el juego

you know I would in many cases I would
consider myself an underdog I'm not a
big guy I don't bring a big presence to
the court
somewhere wasn't MBA the people that
when you take first class site you don't
expect much from them such as German man
to become the first one of the black
first person from also like what did it
take for him to actually overcome all
the obstacles that he went through
and when things are rough I like Romans
5:3 to five it's about how through your
suffering like the end goal is joy
you know I was ready to quit many times
the toughest obstacle was probably
finding someone that would give me a
chance and there are people who you know
my had to call me and be like you're
gonna show up tomorrow and you're gonna
go to practice you're not going to quit
you know heard a lot about Hosea story I
just want to be an encouragement to him
today I get to know him a little bit
spend some time with him hang out he's
out there he thinks he's just doing
drills for the camera and so I'm gonna
try to surprise him yeah I'll see how it
goes
good yeah like trying not to jump around
and you know seem like a little kid but
I wanted to but you know trying to keep
my cool was hard and so much I'm really
taking right now I was not expecting
this you know seeing you play and then
not get to meet in person
oh no it's just mind blowing we're all
into doing slices but here how does he
like you got
okay you want Owen Oh play me one-on-one
yeah okay Hank I'll get right to it then
huh yeah because he's been through what
he's been through he you know has a
solid foundation and understands a lot
more than a typical
18 year old night you can hear it in his
voice you can see it you know you can
see it in a smile and he talks a lot
about his joy the neat thing about it is
if he didn't go through you know the the
addiction and the drugs and the alcohol
I think his perception or his
understanding of joy would be different
I've caused my parents so much pain and
I caused myself a lot of pain as suffer
but you know I still have faith in God I
still pray every night before I go to
bed because that night I could have
easily gone round over in the streets
but someone was looking over me that
night you know you know suffering look
like a lot of different things but
everything always happens for a reason
I still get haunted by that day you know
I can still hear my mom cry but that
motivates me to keep going and finishing
strong and going to college and making
them proud
