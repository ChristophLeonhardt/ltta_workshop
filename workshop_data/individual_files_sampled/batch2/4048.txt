regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against CBS CEO les Moonves prosecutors tell NBC News that they will not pursue one of the allegations against him a woman told Los Angeles police that he had abused her on three occasions in the 1980s prosecutors have declined due to statute of limitations the announcement comes after the New Yorker published an article in which six women alleged sexual misconduct it is not known if the woman in this case was among those who spoke to The New Yorker joining me NBC News senior editor Claire Atkinson Claire what more do you know about this high well another bad day for one of the most powerful men in Hollywood today we're hearing this news about this lady who apparently in February went to the police and told them about a couple of incidents involving Leslie Moonves who is the CBS CEO saying she was abused the fact that she went to the police raises the question of seriousness of allegations against the CEO and we all heard about those on Friday from the New Yorkers Ronan Farrow it's a very bad day for the CBS CEO obviously the LA County Prosecutor's Office is saying that they're declining to prosecute but it's a bad headline on another bad day for CBS because there's other negative news the controlling shareholder of CBS today is revealed to have filed a lawsuit claiming the CBS buried evidence they have disappearing texts and she would like them to preserve evidence because she's in a fight with them Shari redstone this is Shari redstone who controls 80% of voting shares of CBS so six women have said that between between the 1980s and now Moonves sexually harassed them for describe forcible touching or kissing during business meetings - said he physically intimidated them or threatened to derail their careers and it became cold or hostile after they were after he rejected were they rejected his advances excuse me right now the and correct me if I'm wrong the CBS board is deciding whether or not to keep moon buzz on or you two let him go correct so yesterday they had a meeting couple of hours long after the meeting was over they decided they would hire an outside Council to look into the accusations but many were surprised they didn't suspend Leslie Moonves immediately that's typical practice in these cases where a company is investigating a top executive at a company so but they didn't say they're not gonna suspend him at all thing though because when we've seen these allegations come out against other powerful men doing lassiter for instance the reaction has been and the consequences have come through much much swifter way what does it say to you that things are starting starting to slow down in the investigation process it seems before someone is summarily dismissed it seems like these companies are starting to go through and and check these allegations out right certainly in this case the board seems to have decided that perhaps there's two sides to every story and they want to give Leslie a chance to defend himself and that's certainly fair but I think that a lot of corporate governance experts that I've spoken to have said it's a little bit awkward for anybody else that the corporation who has an accusation if the person in power is still at the top and not removed while these things are going on there will be other reports I'm hearing from other outlets besides the New Yorker with accusations that men who were accused of bad behavior will be outed and complaints that women have may haven't been heard correctly so I think CBS's problem is not just that accusations have been made against the CEO but more that there's a culture that hasn't been addressed internally with the correct process and it's not just CBS the entire company it also those who CBS News and the way things have operated there and right and the story we should know by Ronan Farrow takes a look at how things have been done or how things have operated in 60 minutes Claire Atkinson Claire thank you so much for joining us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
