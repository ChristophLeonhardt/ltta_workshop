all right we've got a another devastating story of a trump official being horribly well sexist yes you know I don't throw their around lightly and and of course just wrong on the substance just as importantly so in in this case it's John Kelly he this is back when he was head of Department of Homeland Security and he had an in action with senator Elizabeth Warren in some ways it's an excellent example of the wrongheaded assumptions and and sexism that still exists so let's just first of all note do I think everything is sexist of course not these are like right-wing mythology about how anything that's done wrong to a woman is by definition sexist and part of the patriarchy and that's what all liberals believe now no no no look so on the other hand are there still some examples of sexism and patriarchy left of course right and in fact that's why I think this is a particularly good example of that unfortunately so this is the story of what Elizabeth Warren is in the beginning of the Trump administration challenging the administration on the Muslim ban and in the beginning of course even the Trump people especially during the campaign admitted that it was a Muslim ban in fact Trump said we have to ban all the Muslims from the country until we figure out what the hell is going on as he said right by the way they've had like two years to figure out what the hell's going on has that not been enough time anyway at that point John Kelly who's now the chief of staff was at the time the department head of Homeland Security and the second thing that Elizabeth Warren wanted out of John Kelly was to follow a court order it's not just that she disagreed with the policy but a court had issued an order that the Trump administration was not following they were going outside of the law so she was as a senator and had every right to call in and demand that they follow the law but John Kelly had this reaction he said absolutely the most insulting conversation I've ever had with anyone he was sawing his senior counselor at the time Kevin Carroll she immediately began insult are people accused of that accusing them of not following a court order insulting an abusive behavior towards those covered by the by the pause blah blah blah I didn't say blah blah blah he did he wrote it down in the email okay now let's just think about this for a second if a male senator calls in let's say a mission McConnell or a John Cornyn on the Republican side and says hey John Kelly secretary Kelly you are not following a court order you must get within the legal guidelines of the law right something along those lines he would probably be like oh man I just wow they just called me out and and and we got to make sure we're doing this right and there we were held to account a female senator does it oh so insulting blah blah blah followed the court order okay he said that she was quote an impolite arrogant woman give any idea how arrogant the man he works for us and how impolite he is a guy working for Donald Trump calls a woman impolite and arrogant are you kidding me Donald Trump the guy who said that he is quote a very stable genius that he that he's like a smart person and he has the best words the strongest words okay we didn't go on and on how he Donald Trump said he once beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll there were no polls at the time of Abraham Lincoln I can go on and on and on it to call someone else impolite and arrogant I'll let alone all the bullying of Donald Trump of every other person involved in politics and not involved in politics you get it but it's not just about working for Trump and McConnell and and and you could argue other top Democrats can they be accused of being arrogant absolutely are those as shifts put on them no other bad adjectives might be when they're males or you know overly aggressive I don't know but when it comes to a woman it's a panel of a sudden it's impolite when's the last time seriously guys again I always asked you guys whether you're conservative or libertarian or independent or progressive it doesn't matter seriously when's the last time a male senator was called impolite no matter what they did Lindsey Graham yelling at the top of his lungs Schumer doing whatever he's doing there other adjectives might be used but not impolite but if you're a woman hey hey asking us to follow the law if that's very impolite of you and blah blah blah and whatever the hell you were saying okay so if there is a decent example of sexism and patriarchy yeah no that's rest right up there so in the Trump administration John Kelly is considered within that context to be one of the good guys a stabilizing force on Donald Trump I mean you want to talk about a low bar in that administration even the good guys are terrible people and this is now like the 18th time that John Kelly's been called out on insulting it's just about everyone that isn't a white male and I don't say that lightly or flippantly either but it's literally you know John Kelly's now been called out on saying terrible things about immigrants and minorities and now women and it goes on and on so here I got a couple more things too for you but my favorite this is that was actually not from John Kelly but the guy that he was talking to Carol okay but his senior counselor at Homeland Security now you remember famously Mitch McConnell ordered Elizabeth Warren to be quiet in the Senate and then at the end he said something along the lines of she was warned and she was told not to do it and then the famous court of nevertheless she persisted and now that's in a lot of shirts and etc right and so Carol references that and without any hint of irony or or any of that he says quote toobad Senate Majority Leader McConnell couldn't order her to be quiet again yeah that's that's what they think it's certainly of course of Democratic senators but it appears based on language here specifically of female Democratic senators and Elizabeth Warren and the exact quote by the way at the time from McConnell was she was warned she was given an explanation nevertheless she persisted well I love that she did and then she reacted to this John Kelly news when it broke Elizabeth Warren did was i tough on John Kelly in that phone call you bet I was that's the kind of attitude that I love I don't care if it comes from a man or a woman progressive strength is the best thing in the world and they can call you anything they want in polite arrogant etc but here's what we need Elizabeth Warren to do to persist so and by the way one more thing on the substance of it I just want to thank her for actually trying really hard he you could tell him that in the transcripts and and the things that transpired that it took her many many attempts over the course of a week and then longer to make sure they were following a court order but at the end of the day they were forced to follow that quarter of as usual to trump administration they have to be forced into following the rule of law but nevertheless she persisted and she did get them to do that which is the most important thing in terms of the substance of this issue and that's what we need our Senators and Representatives to do is to fight for us to fight for the rule of law and for reason and logic so thanks so Elizabeth Warren and thanks to this story we know a little bit more about John Kelly one of the so-called good guys in the Trump administration don't be fooled they all signed up to work for Donald Trump none of them are good guys it's just a relative scale of how monstrous they are all right
