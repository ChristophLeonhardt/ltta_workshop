HOWIE: ROB REINER IS AN UNABASHED HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL WHO USES HARSH LANGUAGE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. WE SAT DOWN TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND HIS NEW FILM "SHOCK AND YOUD AWE." ROBERT DE NIRO GOES ON THE TONY AWARD STAGE AND SAYS F TRUMP AND GETS A STANDING OVATION. CAN YOU SEE WHERE THIS WOULD BE OFFENSIVE TO THE 40% WHO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT? YES, AND I CAN SEE HOW IT’S OFFENSIVE TO THE 40% WHO DON’T SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. I DON’T THINK THAT’S PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR THOSE OF US WHO DON’T WANT TO SEE TRUMP IN OFFICE AND DON’T WANT TO SEE HIM CONTINUE TO BE IN OFFICE. HOWIE: YOU TWEETED WHEN AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT ATTACKS OUR CLOSEST ALLIES AND EMBRACES ENEMY POWERS, HE’S IN A CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT TREASON. I DON’T SAY HE IS, I SAID ONE CAN ONLY CONCLUDE. AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. HOWIE: THAT’S A FINE DISTINCTION. I DON’T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT HE COMMITTED TREASON. THAT WILL BE SOMETHING WE DISCOVER OR DON’T DISCOVER AS MUELLER’S INVESTIGATION WHICH UNFORTUNATELY THE HOUSE AND SENATE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT MOVING ALONG. SO WE’LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. HOWIE: YOU DON’T SEE THAT AS AN OVERLY INFLAMMATORY WORD TO USE AGAINST A PRESIDENT? IT IS A VERY INFLAMMATORY WORD. BUT IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE LET’S PUT IT THIS WAY. IF. LET’S PUT IT THIS WAY. FROM WHAT I SEE RIGHT NOW, THERE IS A LOT OF BLANKS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED IN FOR SURE. HOWIE: AFTER THE ELECTION YOU CALLED THE OUTCOME THE GREATEST ATTACK ON THIS DEMOCRACY SINCE 1941. YOU ARE COMPARING THE LAWFUL ELECTION OF A CANDIDATE THROUGH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR. I NOT ONLY AGREE WITH THAT, BUT I WOULD GO EVEN FURTHER. WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE START LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICA, PEOPLE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THIS. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OF DIFFICULT PARTS OF UNDERSTANDING THE RUSSIANS. HOWIE: WE HAD AN ELECTION. YOU ARE COMPARING IT TO 2,000 AMERICANS BEING KILLED AT PEARL HARBOR. I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT, IT’S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS. THIS IS THE KEY TO US HERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A FOREIGN ENEMY POWER INFLUENCING AN ELECTION. IN THE WORLD OF CYBER WARFARE, IT IS INSIDIOUS. AND WE DON’T NECESSARILY FEEL IT. WE DO KNOW THE CAPACITY. WE ARE LEARNING THE CAPACITY. NOT JUST FROM A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AND ACTIVE MEASURES. THE SOVIETS AND RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOREVER. HOWIE: LET’S TALK ABOUT THE PRESS. YOU CALL IT STATE-RUN MEDIA. I PRESUME YOU KNOW FOX HAS A THRIVING NEWS DIVISION WITH CHRIS WALLACE AND BRET BAIER. I ALSO TWEETED OUT ABOUT SHEPARD SMITH AND BY THE WAY, I HAVE MET SHEPARD SMITH AND HE IS REPORTING THE NEWS. THERE IS NO QUESTION BY THE. HE’S TELLING THE TRUTH. AND SO IS CHRIS WALLACE. I HAVEN’T SEEN AS MUCH OF BRET BAIER. AND I KNOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NEWS REPORTING AND OPINION AND EDITORIAL AND ALL OF THAT. BUT WHAT I’M SAYING IS THE EDITORIAL PART OF FOX NEWS WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, HANNITY, AND TUCKER CARLSON, AND LAURA INGRAHAM. THOSE SHOWS NOT THEY ARE REALLY IN SUPPORT OF TRUMP. AND THAT IS FOX NEWS HAS A GOOD ARRAY HAS STRONG RATINGS. THERE IS A CHUNK OF MEDIA THAT IS VERBALLY AND OVERTLY IN SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP. THAT’S JUST TRUE. HOWIE: THERE WAS A CHUNK OF MEDIA THAT WAS IN SUPPORT OF BARACK OBAMA. LET’S TALK ABOUT THE RUNUP TO THE IRAQ WAR. YOU ARE PLAYING JOHN WOLCOTT. AN OLD COLLEAGUE OF MINE. IN TERMS OF NAME I.D., WOULD YOU THINK TOM HANKS WAS WOULD HAVE AN EASIER TIME. ALEC BALDWIN WAS SET TO PLAY THAT PART. WE HAD BEEN SHOOTING FOR A WEEK AND ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOOT ON MONDAY HE CALLED AND DROPPED OUT. I SAID WHAT DO I DO? MY WIFE MICHELLE SUGGESTED I PLAY THE PART. I THOUGHT I DON’T KNOW, I DON’T LIKE DIRECTING AND ACTING. I SAID I’M AVAILABLE SO I WILL DO IT. THE ONE BIT OF DIRECTION I GOT, SHE SAID TRY TO BE LESS JEWISH. I THOUGHT I DON’T KNOW, I’M HOWIE: MORE NOW WITH ROB REINER AS WE TURN TO HIS FILM ABOUT THE PRESS, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND THE PRESS. YOU SAY THE MEDIA WEREN’T TOUGH ENOUGH AND NONEXISTENT. IN ONE SCENE YOU PLAYING WOLCOTT CALL THE. INQUIRER AND COMPLAIN THEY ARE NOT RUNNING YOUR STORIES. THAT WAS THE CASE. THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. KNIGHT RIDDER NEWS SERVICE WAS SUPPLIED TO A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY WERE SUPPLIED BY A LOT OF MILITARY BASES. MY CHARACTER SAYS WE DON’T WRITE FOR PEOPLE WHO SEND OTHER PEOPLE’S KIDS TO WAR. WE WRITE FOR PEOPLE WHOSE KIDS GET SENT TO WAR. WE WERE CONCERNED THE KNIGHT RIDDER STORIES WERE NOT GETTING OUT. MANY OF THESE PAPERS DID NOT PRINT. THEY DIDN’T PRINT THEM. HOWIE: WERE THEY NOT GETTING A LOT OF PICKUP BECAUSE OF THE MINDSET IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA? BOB WOOD WARD TOLD ME AFTERWARDS HE WAS PART OF THE MIND THINK. WE WERE SWEPT UP IN PATRIOTISM, 9/11. AND PEOPLE WENT WITH THE GROUP THINK. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IN A SMART WAY FROM THEIR STANDPOINT, THEY NEVER RESPONDED TO THESE ARTICLES. THEY GAVE THEM NO OXYGEN. THEY DIDN’T REBUKE THEM OR TALK ABOUT THEM. SO IT NEVER GOT ANY ATTENTION. HOWIE: THE UNDERLYING ATTENTION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS LYING ABOUT IRAQ. BUT THAT AS OPPOSED TO CHERRY PICKING INTELLIGENCE AS OPPOSED TO NOT BEING SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE. EVEN JOHN WOLCOTT TO THIS DAY SAYS HE DOESN’T KNOW PEOPLE ARE LYING. WE ARE SAYING CHENEY LIED. WE ARE SAYING CHENEY LIED AT THIS ONE THING ABOUT THE IDEA IN GENERAL BECAUSE HE HAD HE TALKED ABOUT A CONNECTION BETWEEN MOHAMMAD ATTA AND IRAQIN TELL JONES WHICH DIDN’T EXIST. THEY TALKED ABOUT THEM BEING ON THE VERNAL OF GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON. HOWIE: ONE THING THAT TURNED OUT TO BE UNTRUE AS TERRIBLE AS IT IS IS NOT THE SAME AS LYING AND DELIBERATELY PEDDLING FALSEHOODS. THAT’S TRUE. BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU MADE THE ASSUMPTION YOU WANT TO GO TO WAR AND YOU ARE CRAFTING BITS AND PIECES OF INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE THAT CASE, AND IGNORING THE VAST AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE. BECAUSE WE HAVEN’T BEEN INSIDE IRAQ WITH WEAPONS INSPECTORS IN FOUR YEARS. HOWIE: IN FAIRNESS HE GOT A LOT OF NEGATIVE COVERAGE IN NOISE QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT I DON’T THINK DURING THE PRIMARY SEASON AND EVEN DURING THE GENERAL HE GOT THE KIND OF THERE IS ONE THING TO SAY NEGATIVE COVERAGE AND ONE THING TO SAY DUE DILIGENCE AND SCRUTINY. REAL SCRUTINY. I DON’T THINK HE GOT THAT. HOWIE: YOU HAD A CIVIL DEBATE WITH ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. ARE YOU GOING TO DO AN ODD COUPLE SHOW? I DIDN’T KNOW. THEY SAID SCARAMUCCI I DIDN’T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE THERE. ARE WE GOING TO DO A SHOW LIKE CROSSFIRE? NO, I DON’T THINK SO. HOWIE: YOU ARE GIVING IT A
