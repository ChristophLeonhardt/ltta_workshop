good job that you guys didn't listen to
peer pressure today at least you tried

about you being scared to get in trouble
right it's not always about getting in
trouble sometimes it's about getting a
reward a reward is like it's something
that you get when you do the right thing
so when you do the right thing sometimes
you get remember that telling us to do

cloud you know what I'm really glad that
you guys listen well and you guys didn't
give in to peer pressure
yeah what's all it tells you to do
something you know you shouldn't do you
don't listen to them not because you
don't want to get in trouble but because
you want to do the right thing doing the
right thing is most important
well what is peer pressure
yeah peer pressure is when someone tells
you to do something you know you
shouldn't do what sometimes this your
friends or your brother but sometimes
it's an adult who tries to get you to do
something you shouldn't do so make sure
you do the right thing all the time okay
what is peer pressure deal peeper sure
is what that is you need your girl right
the right
but damn not a guarantee I'm not good
your why are you gonna give me one sure
you gonna let me have it
yeah that's very generous thank you
I don't know how in focus I am right now
but the truth is you can almost make a
lesson out of anything a simple thing
like self-control peer pressure and
telling the truth in door busts right
can be shown in most of different ways
this is home school for us this is a way
for us to kind of examine our children
and see if they are understanding the
things that we are telling them
sometimes as a parent you don't know if
your words are getting through and this
is very encouraging for me to know that
they care about disappointing me one of
the things I was exposed to here was
that they were more scared to get in
trouble but which I understand you know
that is is a child's you know mind but
hopefully I can assure them into more of
an excitement to do the right thing
because it's just right really impressed
that we all share this little
is that you know this video is not
