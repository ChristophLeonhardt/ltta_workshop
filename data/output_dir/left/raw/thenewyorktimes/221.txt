1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,250
A special election in Arizona

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,340
was triggered by a sex scandal

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,560
involving Republican Trent Franks.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,450
A former staffer said he asked her

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,590
to carry his baby in
exchange for $5 million.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,140
The controversy spurred
him to quit in December.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,820
“What does the statement say?”
“Take a look at it.”

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,700
And now the race is on to fill his seat.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,580
The Republican? Debbie Lesko.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,610
“I’m a conservative Republican.”

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,070
Served in State Legislature.

12
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,690
It’s her race to lose.

13
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,760
Campaigning as a domestic
violence survivor

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,710
and victims’ advocate.

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,690
“I left an abusive ex-husband.”

16
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,340
The Democrat is Hiral Tipirneni.

17
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,690
“It’s time for a change.”

18
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,710
Not a politician.

19
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,940
She’s an E.R. doctor.

20
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,500
A bonus in a district 
with 20 percent seniors.

21
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,600
She’s the underdog.

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,780
“We have a really great
shot at flipping this seat.”

23
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,270
The Eighth District?

24
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,270
It’s in the Phoenix suburbs.

25
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,960
Very Republican.

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,680
Wannabe senator and Trump superfan

27
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,350
Sheriff Joe Arpaio is based here.

28
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,600
“I’m a big supporter of the president.”

29
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,710
Two big issues.

30
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,100
The first is health care.

31
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,150
Tipirneni wants universal coverage.

32
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,280
“Affordable quality health care.”

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,750
Lesko wants to cut health care
spending, but is vague.

34
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,370
“I don’t know what, ultimately, we can do.

35
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,580
I just know it needs to be done.”

36
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,980
Then there’s the wall.

37
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,430
Lesko? Pretty much for it.

38
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,840
“Part of the solution is building the wall.”

39
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,170
Tipirneni’s not.

40
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,060
“There are other areas to use that money.”

41
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,330
Speaking of money,

42
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,140
Republicans and their allies
aren’t taking any chances.

43
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,390
After recent losses in
strongholds like Alabama

44
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,950
and Pennsylvania’s 18th District

45
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,640
They’ve spent over
a million for Lesko.

46
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,980
Trump won this district
by more than 20 points.

47
00:01:29,980 --> 00:00:00,000
So even a close finish by the
Democrats would be a surprise.
