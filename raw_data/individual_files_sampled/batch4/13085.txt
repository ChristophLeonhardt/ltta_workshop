sometimes in the battle between left and right we forget to listen to one another we conservatives for instance we look at our brothers and sisters on the left and think what a bunch of hateful small-minded dishonest unamerican regressive knuckleheads trying to force their nonsensical atheistic self-serving dishonest hateful on American agenda on people who reject their mindless stupid cliched slogans and idiotic ill-thought-out small-minded unrealistic theories and instead of opening up meaningful dialogue with these name-calling sloganeering poorly dressed crypto racist fat-headed

talk about something serious today because you know Putin Vladimir Putin won his election so I think it's his fourth term of six years basically he's the Czar and as I've said before he is a murderous gangster there's no two ways about this is for a while he was killing so many journalists who exposed his nefarious doings that I think Russia was the third most dangerous country on earth to be a journalist in after like Iran and one other nuts unsavory place there's all kinds of rumors about the way he killed his way to the top setting off bombs and he some of this stuff hasn't been proven but setting off terrorist attacks and then blaming not Chechens and showing himself to be a strong man and certainly he has messed with our election system and made everybody hysterical here although I'm not sure whether that's his fault of the people who were hysterical but you know everybody's talking about Donald Trump Donald Trump Russia Donald Trump Russia today in the Wall Street Journal Walter Russell Mead who now has a column and it's an absolutely terrific addition to the Wall Street Journal column family wrote this piece where he said he was talking about Putin and you know putting won this election by 77% and they reported you know he is popular he has improved the economic life of the country but he is also an authoritarian sob you know and he's a it's a gangster aa cracy where they sold off the the state Holdings that had been accumulated by communism they sold that off to a bunch of oligarchs who now are dependent on Putin you know he if you have a business and he decides you've gotten too much business they come in and arrest you for absolutely nothing confiscate your business take it away that's what living in Russia is like so Walter Russell Mead writes about when they're blaming Trump he says you know President Obama read beautiful speeches about the responsibility to protect the the enviable 'ti of international borders the arc of justice and the evils of chemical weapons but while he was making those pretty speeches Vladimir Putin merrily conquered Crimea invaded Ukraine's Dumba's region helped Bashar Assad fight one of the ugliest and deadliest campaign since world war two regained russia's position in the Middle East that Leonid Brezhnev had lost for the Soviets in the 1970s and used the hapless Secretary of State John Kerry as a diplomatic punching bag meanwhile his agents revived old Cold War networks in Europe used Russian finance as an instrument of subversive state power and helped plunge the u.s. into a profound crisis of self-doubt by meddling in our 2016 presidential campaign and it isn't just mr. Putin he goes on the trio of revisionist powers includes Russia China and Iran along with camp followers like Venezuela Cuba North Korea and Syria together they have up ended the global balance of power and China of course is thrilled they sent their you know well everybody in the West was going great you know Putin won you know kind of sending him these muted congratulations presidency Jinping said his countries partnership with Russia was at its best level in history and of course G has just become basically the Czar of China so that's a huge amount of land mass that is now run by basically a tyrant is run by a king a lot of spaces and then you have of course you have all the trouble in the Middle East and all the fat cats you know fat rulers in the Middle East sitting on all the wealth there but then you have Western Europe which is in some ways even more troubling because Western Europe you know Russia and China have never had histories of freedom but Western Europe of course was the cradle of modern Liberty and they are basically allowing their country to be swept away under this you know onrush of Islamic immigration and and you can say you know it's not as bad as it looks over here now that's one of the things I learned about traveling in the world when you read about other countries in the paper it looks like the sky is falling but when you get over there life is continuing as normal it's just that you know these troubles are haunting the place but when I look at this this Telford thing that is now coming out another city in Britain where Muslims were allowed to groom as they put it hundreds and hundreds of young non-muslim girls for sex slavery you know I I'm sorry to lead with this but it really is important because I want to I want to just show you know as tyranny is taking is coming back into play Oh in Russia now remember we have this like little 10-year window after the Soviet Union fell where there was a chance for Russia to be free that has fallen apart under Putin China looked like it was liberalizing their economy was doing so well now that's disappearing under gee you know and I know that people keep telling me that the economy in China is gonna take over the world I'm not so sure because I'm not so sure you can run a tyrannical and capitalist economy I'm not so sure it's not a paper tiger a paper dragon underneath it all but but still the economy is doing well right now and it doesn't really how can I put this it doesn't really matter if your economy is doing well if you're not free but here here in England the cradle of our freedom I mean just the place where modern freedom and the modern idea of freedom was born they had this horrible thing where they let these girls get groomed for sex slavery young girls up to you know as young as 11 and didn't do anything about it because the police did not want to be seen the authorities did not want to be seen as racist there so hamstrung by the this idea that they could be racist that they let this happen I just want you to listen to this this is tough to listen to it's about a minute plus long this is a girl on the BBC telling what it was like when these clowns did this did this to her it is worth hearing they quickly moved on to being sold and entombed in every single day so I'd be being sold maybe two or three times a night taken unto the only anything I can describe as a rape ice which was set up for the purpose young girls being sold to to man the reason why I kept going back was they were threatening me with burning my house down which was a real threat in Telford because that had actually happened in previously and they would say to me they would think my mom and my sisters and they knew all about my family yeah there was just no no escape at all I was gang-raped just after I turned 16 and that was probably the worst the worst thing that ever happened to me sorry you don't need to apologize no way and after that I tried to commit suicide and people would say to me was a cry for help and I was saying no I I genuinely wanted to die because I thought that was the only way the way out I was in cars that was stopped and searched by the police with older man and it's never questioned why I was in now or who I was my name's never asked and I just think if if they've been more proactive at points like that things could have changed idiot but they wouldn't move they wouldn't act I mean in this if it if a society's first obligation isn't to protect its young women its young people you know I don't know what it is so you're talking about a kind of failure of nerve in the West as the as the rest of the world is going under is falling under this authoritarian these authoritarian regimes I just want to read one other survivor this is not graphic but but she talks about the fact she says they made it clear that because I was non Muslim and not a virgin and because I didn't dress modestly that they believed I deserve to be punished they said I had to obey or be beaten it's another sex slave essentially and they say she says Islamophobic online hate and personal attacks occur every day and in response anti-fascist groups in the far-left carry out their own violent attacks on groups they perceived to compromise comprise white supremacist or Nazis as someone who has experienced life inside a grooming gang I can tell you with certainty that none of this is likely to make any difference to the behaviors of the groomers like terrorists they firmly believe that the crimes they carry out are justified by their religious beliefs if anything rising anti-muslim hate will probably make groomers stronger in their convictions and drive ordinary young Muslim men towards fundamentalism grooming gangs and terrorism the camaraderie protection money and kudos that these groups offer makes them a strong pull for anyone worryingly several young men I have spoken to joke that being a gangster and going to jail are their life goals you know what what it is is like that it's that like that Yeats poem the the best lack all conviction and the worst are filled with passionate intensity so they have these Muslims doing these horrible things you have you know Muslim hate groups people who hate Muslims fighting with leftists who hate everybody and they're fighting it out and that doesn't help anything that's why you see you see a lot of women now there's an article someone sent me yesterday a lot of women escaping from Sweden - hungry okay think about that for a minute they're escaping the rapes the Muslim rapes in Sweden to go to hungry because hungry won't allow you know the Eastern Europe is not allowing the same level of Muslim immigration but of course in Hungary - there's rising anti-semitism so the same people who are saying no Islamists welcome are also saying we don't like Jews I mean it's kind of a complex it's part of the same mindset we're gonna get back to this in a minute but first let's talk about something more cheerful cheerful because here we're still doing great and you can get good food delivered to your door through blue apron blue apron is the leading meal kit delivery service

get $30 off at blue apron dot-com slash Andrew it is a better way to cook so but Stevens the former conformally conservative columnist from The Wall Street Journal who has now gone over to the New York Times and has breathed in they don't the kool-aid you don't have to drink the kool-aid there you just breathe it in and Stevens is hates Trump so much that he's become kind of a weird columnist at some times and he wrote this column about the rise of what he calls a euro putinism and that I didn't really like the column that much it reminded me of Zeff Rogan and this is the end remember the epochal that comedy this apocalyptic comedy and Seth Rogen says I'm gluten-free and the other guy says to him you don't even know what gluten is and Rogan says gluten is everything bad and so as with gluten so with Putin Bret Stevens kind of any movement that he dislikes he sees is helping Putin but he ends the this column with some great paragraphs which I will read he says Europe's larger problem in the face of Putin's serial aggressions isn't a diss main and potentially compromised US president it isn't the methods the Kremlin is used to subvert Western democracies the troll farms propaganda channels email hacks rent to protest or loans to extremist parties and it isn't a matter of ideology either the Kremlin is as happy to ally itself with fascists as with communists techno an R cos are radical environmentalists the deeper reason Putin seduces is that he believes in the principle of power he acts the uses of his power are mainly wicked but wickedness at least is a quality particularly when it is wedded to political efficacy personal forcefulness and the appearance of great cunning and here's the graph that really got grabbed me he said compare that to the last decade or so of European leaders David Cameron Matteo Renzi Nicolas Sarkozy jean-claude Juncker even Angela Merkel what did any of them stand for what did any of them stand for what in their personalities was anything other than feckless and pallid who among them would pull a trigger for their country's preservation or even for their own how many of them will be remembered in 20 years time Vladimir Putin is a criminal president who poses a clear and present danger to democratic society but nobody can accuse him of being feckless or pallid or unwilling to pull a trigger I mean this is what we're talking about when we're talking about the Islamist invasion of Western Europe that people will literally sit there and let their little girls get raped in order not to show themselves to be bigoted and there is bigotry in the opposition to Islam there is you know I mean it's not it's not people that I I protest against is the beliefs of certain Islamists the belief of certain Street strand of Islam that allows them to do this and if you allow a lot of Islamists in your country without vetting them very very carefully you are going to get a lot of this coming in and you have a right to protect your Creed you have a right to protect your nation you have a right to protect the ideas that have made the West so great and that is what brings us back here to America and to Trump and the question is how does Trump fit in I know Bret Stevens thinks oh he's just an another thought another authoritarian you know he used it he's another strong man another guy willing to step out what does he stand for you know that's that's what Stevens thinks you know so far I don't see it so far I don't see it and I have been absolutely gobsmacked by the way Trump has inspired a level of hatred on the left and foul nasty rhetoric I mean it is just from the very beginning this is from the very beginning you know I looked at I looked at the election in a certain way I didn't like Trump I was very much opposed to him during the primaries once he became the candidate and I compared him to Hillary Clinton I took a long long time to think it over before I decided you know I have to vote for Donald Trump and so far I've been really happy that I did so far Trump has been obstreperous chaotic he does a lot of crazy things but his policies have been great and I don't even half the time I don't even like to talk about persons I like to talk about policies because that's what really matters but I looked at I looked at the election like a maze he goes I think of it this way you're amazed and you can only go forward right it's like a fantasy maze the maze disappears in back of you you can only go forward and of course as you go through a maze you've taken some wrong turns and you don't know where you're are and you're lost and you come to a wall and you can only go left or right and to the left is a pit of fire and to the right is a corridor filled with crap okay and so the intellectuals are saying you know oh I can't step into crap you know this you know metaphysically when you think about it it's not a binary decision you think like well wait I'm standing at a wall I can only turn left or right I can't go back it's a binary decision and and you know the intellectuals say well if we walk in the pit of fire will always be able to put the ashes back together again you go ahead and then you've got the moralist to say well once you step in crap once you step in crap there's no going back it's crap all the rest of the way you know and you know I'm saying I'm saying like well it's a maze right once we go maybe we can still make decisions as long as we haven't been burned up we can make decisions turns left and right and of course the mob there's a you know there's a lot of people going like hooray crap so it's a very complex thing it's a complex thing what I said is now I'll take the right turn I'll take the right turn on wade through the crap and then we'll make decisions as we go and hopefully find our way back to our principles and back to our freedoms but the the left immediately as they always did always do they reacted to Trump what's their what's their mantra what's their matter of any right-wing President Bush's Hitler you know they're all Hitler you know if John McCain may be the only guy they didn't say it was Hitler but Trump is Hitler I'll get back to that for a minute but I want to talk for another second about wonder II we were talking about their new this is war podcast wonder he is a great place to go for podcasts I know because they

to the daily wire.com so let me let me show you some pictures some just some stuff about the left I mean we know that the left is represented not just by Democrats not just but also by the media and by the entertainment and the entertainment networks here are here are just I want to show you two comedians let me just see when this is from this is from to this is before the election this is in Marsh Susan Silverman is that her name Susan Silverman right Sarah Silverman right sorry Sarah Silverman goes on the Conan show dressed up as Hitler and complains about being compared to Donald Trump so here's Sarah Silverman dressed as Hitler and being interviewed by Conan my understanding is you want to clear the air because you think you're being unfavorably compared to Donald Trump don't get me wrong Conan I agree with a lot he says a lot like 90% of what he says I'm like this guy got too but it's just I'm like the way he says it it's just it's crass yeah yeah Trump is very very crass yeah so Hitler agrees with Donald Trump but Trump is too crass for Hitler I mean you know this is all right at least at least this is when he's just a candidate and and I have nothing against by the way obviously I obviously have nothing against I do it political satire but this is a very very specific thing that they do over and over again Bill Maher did the same things play that he played a Hitler speech and then translated it for you watch this look at this Hitler speech and we've translated it for you thank you thank you we're gonna make Germany great again that I can tell you believe me Germany doesn't want anymore England France America they're laughing at us the Treaty of Versailles a terrible deal we have stupid people who are our leaders really stupid people making terrible deals I mean my release is funny but you know after all we had heard this it's not like we haven't heard this about george w bush it's not like we haven't been listening to every single conservative be called and compared to hitler so at this point you know even from had actually been adler instead of who he is which seems to be a normal republican with a big mouth you know even if he meant we wouldn't have listened because it's the boy cried wolf you know the the left has a big problem with metaphorical thinking they use metaphors and then they believe the metaphors to be the fact right so they'll say you know what language is violence and then they'll beat you up if you try to speak because language is violence so it makes sense this they're only beating you up in in self and self defense and inequality is violence so we have the right to take to the streets and riot you know they get that constant whatever that whatever it is the environment hurting the environment is violence you know so we have the right to blow up your factories we did this a little bit with obama on the right you know obama we're constantly saying obama is a tyrant and and i would say to people you know i don't know as anybody banging on your door or arresting you there was one guy that video maker got arrested like that and they were saying there are things that obama did that toyed with tyranny but he wasn't not a tyrant right he was not a tyrant he was still just an American president with bad ideas so this is the problem with this kind of here we are we're still free we're still have our Constitution we're still working in our system and all this talk is dangerous when we're surrounded we are an island of freedom now in a world that is becoming increasingly authoritarian and this talk is dangerous so yesterday I've talked about how Trump unleashed his twits tweeter Twitter turbot weather storm against against robert muller and the press went nuts it's war he's at war with the FBI that metaphorical lament language I mean if he's war you really have to fight that he said that he talked about the fact that when Andrew McCabe said that he had consulted with James Comey about releasing secret information that made Comey a liar because Comey had sat and said he did not ever release leaked any information and he hadn't known anybody to leak information what hilariously The Washington Post did a fact check where they just went after him saying oh my gosh this is that lies but nowhere in the fact check did they disprove anything he said they talked about his language they talk about you know they'll say they'll say he used you know kind of laughs that you know it's his typical overstated loudmouth language but they know where do they do they disprove that Comey did in fact was in fact in conflict with with Andrew McCabe said he did so talking about how they get crazy I have to play this one just for comic relief Chris Matthews is talking about Muller investigating Donald Trump remember I'm talking about metaphorical language and how once you get into the metaphor you start to think that the metaphor is the reality instead of a metaphor Chris here's Chris Matthews going insane on actual television moa reminds me of the starfish which gets itself tightly around the clam and uses all its stuff that we can and pry open the clam now this is a battle to the death as far as the clam is concerned if the starfish is able to open him even a little bit he can get open him open all the way and that's it of course for the clam he's the starfish his lunch I've watched a number of these starfishes along the way these special counsels are independent prosecutors which is what we used to call them like starfishes they don't give up their purpose in life is to open the clam get with in them and devoured whole whatever else you can say about him Robert Moore is a perfect example of a starfish he will not stop until he has gotten Trump to open up he will use the charges he has against Trump's family as leverage the witnesses he's gotten from plea bargains the power of subpoena and time if you haven't noticed mowers in no hurry he just keeps prying in that clam in the White House is now snugly in his grip does anyone think this is going to end well for the clam maker you want to take Robert Muller home dry him out and hang him on my wall a little starfish decoration like we used to do at the beach when we were kids think about it is is you know using metaphor he's using a metaphor badly is called running your metaphor into the ground but but still still that kind of thinking leads to this kind of thinking here is John Dean who was obviously a guy in the Nixon administration got caught lying he was testified against Nixon listen to what he says about Trump's tweet Trump tweeting that the robert muller investigation is a witch-hunt he compares this to Richard Nixon's attempt to obstruct justice listen to this are you surprised President Trump has now started going after Muller by name I am NOT I what I think we're witnessing is a very public obstruction of justice he as I see it has already exceeded everything that Nixon did he's really much more intimately involved than Nixon ever was in the cover-up Nixon the first eight months of Watergate just learns a little bit now and then from his chief of staff Bob Haldeman he doesn't have he's not really in it it's later when things get hotter that he gets hands on but Trump from the very beginning he's involved in this and so I see a very different profile and the big difference being Nixon was behind closed doors or everyone was surprised when there were recordings of it Trump is just not right up front on it and he's dealing it very publicly I mean that's a pretty stunning statement that you're said I just want to have you repeat that you're saying in your opinion Donald Trump is has gone farther than Richard Nixon did to obstruct justice that's exactly what I'm saying I think Trump is Nixon on steroids and stilts he sent out a tweet how does a tweet obstruct justice it's it's an insane example of metaphorical thinking there is no obstruction first of all as far as we know there's no crime now legally you can obstruct justice even though there's no crime but it's kind of absurd to charge somebody with it and what on earth is he talking about what is he talking about why doesn't Donald Trump have the right to go forward and defend himself now look you you cannot say that I haven't spoken about my misgivings about Donald Trump about his manners about his the way he operates the chaos on the White House all these things I have I talk about them all the time but it a precedent has to be judged by his policies and by his actions and so far first of all he's been much tougher on Putin than Obama ever was I mean the main thing the main battle weapon we have against Putin is fracking is taking away the power of his Petro dollars which support everything he does I mean he hadn't they never got any business it's all Petro dollars over there so if we could frack them into the ground you know and actually you know undercut him entirely but there may come a time when Trump there's something authoritarian when he subverts the Constitution when he oversteps the role of president there may come that time and we will talk about it here and I'm sure a lot of people on the right will talk about it but the time hasn't come it hasn't come and if we're not why aren't we supporting him what is it about him that is driving the left so crazy well meanwhile on the left on the left the move away from democracy is clearly on the march the move to shout down free speech the move to destroy capitalism I mean let's let's talk about capitalism for just a minute yeah it wasn't yesterday Elizabeth Warren Michael Moore Bernie Sanders whose combined net worth okay they could buy and sell me a gazillion times these are three multimillionaires sitting around selling socialism listen to this over the last the middle class of this country has declined while our donkey is on the rise it's so crazy the rich right now the greed the level of greed this is an organized effort just simply to take over our government and make the government work better and better for a thinner and thinner rich slice in America like us people sitting there I mean what is let's talk about this for a minute what is the problem with capitalism capitalism is a brilliant system which I don't I don't think you can have you can have capitalism without democracy or democracy without capitals and people keep telling me how China has got it China is gonna oh yes China has invented capitalism with authoritarianism that talked to me again in 10 years because I think in economic collapse or will have democratized one of the other but what is wrong with capitalism capitalism is a system just like American democracy American debt the American Republic is also a system that pits our natural instincts against one another for the common good okay so I'm greedy I want to make money I want to do things for me under capitalism under democracy the best way for me to do that is to collaborate with you right so the best way for me to serve me is to invent an iPhone that you want to buy and you give me the money for that iPhone because it's worth more to you than the money you would rather have the iPhone then the money and then I get the money and that's the way capitalism works what is the problem with that the problem with it and why do people lie to people who are so blessed to live in Kappa some kind of capitalist country why they constantly working to turn it into socialist countries when all around them socialist countries are collapsing in Venezuela where they're eating cats not even dogs I mean dogs in Venezuela would be a delicacy cats fat right you know seriously they're starving in this country that is just awash in oil and food and all everything you need because of socialism why doesn't happen it happens because of freedom and capitalism do not supply meaning this is why our founding fathers said repeatedly you going to have to have religion if you want to live by this constitution all our founding fathers said this you're going to have to have religion it wasn't because religion constrains you morally it wasn't because religion will tell you don't do this don't do that it's because religion will supply you with meaning in a system that's not meant to supply you with meaning it's meant to leave you free to find meaning and what is happening on in the West is that we have lost the idea of meaning you know I'm reading I told you yesterday I'm reading this book by Steven Pinker called enlightenment now and Pinker is basically a materialist when I say that what I mean is he doesn't really believe that you're there he thinks you're a machine that produces the kind of illusion that you're there also this book sapiens that I read by Yuval Harare he also says this is basically the same thing you're not really there you don't really have free will that's just an illusion over time at the beginning of Pinker's book he's giving a speech selling these goods and I really like Pinker and her I like them both they're really good writers really interesting books they're just wrong you know they should happen to be wrong about a very important thing somebody gets up and says to Pinker why should I live why should I live if what you're saying is true now I'm gonna give you his answer as he says he has rewritten it for his book he says in the very act act of asking that question you are seeking reasons for your convictions and so you are committed to reason as the means to discover and justify what is important to you and there are so many reasons to live as a sentient being you have the sentient being you have the potential to flourish you can refine your Faculty of Reason itself by learning and debating you can seek explanations of the natural world through science and insight into the human condition through the arts and humanities you can make the most of your capacity for pleasure and satisfaction which allowed your ancestors to thrive and thereby allowed you to exist you can appreciate the beauty and richness of the natural and cultural world as the heir to billions of years of life perpetuating itself you can perpetuate life in turn you have been endowed with a sense of sympathy the ability to like love respect help and show kindness and you can enjoy the gift of mutual benevolence with friends family and colleagues and because reason tells you that none of this is particular to you you have the responsibility to provide to others what you expect for yourself you can foster the welfare of other sentient beings by enhancing life health knowledge freedom abundance safety beauty and peace history shows that when we sympathize with others and apply our ingenuity to improving the human condition we can make progress in doing so and you can help to continue that progress all of those are beautiful things none of them answer the girls question the girls question is why should I live that means she needs a purpose it's not meaning comes through purpose maybe all the things that he talks about are pleasures they are deep deep pleasures very important and they do enhance life but let me just give you a reason why it's not a sufficient answer if I took a gun and held it to your head every single day every single day I followed you with a gun to your head and told you what to do and all my advice was good I told you how to take care of your health I told you how to treat your wife I told you how to raise your children I told you what job to take and all my advice was right your life went great you lived long and prospered you were healthy everything went great your wife loved you your kids loved you everything because of everything I was telling you to do with that gun to your head and you live to be a hundred and died suddenly in your sleep I would have taken away from you everything that matters because it's all about your purpose and your purpose depends on your free will and your presence as a human being as an actual being expressed through your body he Pinker does not believe that is true he makes fun of people who say you know who belittle the great gifts of science and I don't think they belittle them but some people belittle the gray say oh well it's just longer life it's just more health it's just more cleaner drinking water well of course those things of great great blessings but they are not the meaning of life you are the meaning of life in your relationship to God because it's only through God that any of this makes any sense at all all the things that they don't believe in all the things that they don't believe in provide the purpose if you don't believe in free will how can you believe in freedom if you don't believe in free will why should people be free I mean you would have to make some kind of complex game theory argument that only working together could we come up with the right answers but that's not true and they don't believe it Obama was always saying I wish I could just run by the rule by the experts but we have all these annoying democratic laws freedom is there for you to find the meaning and purpose of your life the development of yourself into its fullest expression of what God intended you to be if you don't believe in that you have lost the plot of freedom that's why Europe has no leaders that's why they're so the the left is so insane about Trump it's not the Trump has done anything authoritarian though he may he hasn't yet it's not that it's because they want to be authoritarian and they think he is getting in him in their way which so far he is which is great so so you know I think that underneath all this underneath all this we have to recover this sense of meaning and I'm sorry to tell you that it comes through god but it does I'm sorry that it probably only comes through Christ but probably only does but you know those are the things that we're gonna have to start looking about we're gonna have to start talking about we're gonna have to start recovering logically through wisdom through insight through reading for ourselves and then give them to each other we can't force them on each other we have to give them to each other because otherwise we are going to lose the plot and this great sea of authoritarianism that is growing throughout the world is going to close in and cover us sexual Follies so this is not off the subject there is this stormy Daniels thing going on I'm not covering it very much because I don't care and I don't care you know that this is something that the Trump did before he was in office or they say he did they say he slept with a porn star and then paid her off to keep quiet in keeping with the comedians who just can't stop spewing this hatred I mean it really is hatred it's not even funny Stephen Colbert has this completely unfunny show called our cartoon president is that what it's called and and he's so he makes fun of the stormy Daniels thing here her birth name is Stephanie Clifford but elementary school history books will forever refer to her as stormy Daniels in 2006 she allegedly had sex with a recently married Donald Trump his chin dripping with a lipitor Bowl hormone cookie dough milkshake then she accepted one hundred and thirty thousand dollars to stay silent about what Americans already instinctively knew in their amygdala hindbrain here now is President Trump side of the story starmie daniels is lying unless she says i'm a wild cat in bed in which case it's all true so you know obviously it's just a way of running down Trump but he's he's a billionaire around beauty contests we know exactly what kind of life he led he's never been it was not a big secret that he was leading that life he was not leading the life of a politician or a priest he was leading out in the open the life of a billionaire playboy so that's who he was meanwhile over at the John Oliver show what is his show called last week this week last week last week tonight John Oliver he is picking on Charlotte pence who he had a vice president Mike Pence's daughter wrote a children's book about her bunny Marlin bundo touring the house during the vice president following the vice president through the day proceeds from this book go to charity and John Oliver decides to make fun of this book this the child of the vice president not the vice president make fun of this book because he doesn't like Mike Pence's attitude toward gays at the end of our hop I said Wesley I don't want to hop without you ever again and Wesley said that's funny because I never want to hop without you Marlon bundo ever again and we both said we will get married and hop together forever stinkbug you can't get married the stinkbug was in charge all the animals listen to him even though he was very stingy bunnies don't marry boy bunnies boy bunnies have to marry girl bunnies oh but don't worry we had a plan a plan that involved all the animals in the garden and if you want to know how the story turns out you are going to have to buy the book please buy it for your children buy it for any child you know or just buy it because you know it would annoy Mike Pence so what I want to know is this aside from the fact of why John Oliver can't can't leave the daughter of the Vice President alone and let her sell her book for charity aside from that what I want to know is we can make fun of Donald Trump for having consensual it was obviously consensual sex that was if it happened the assuming that happened was adulterous but Mike Pence can't have his opinions about other people's sex lawyers so where where do we draw the line when when is what is the room what are the rules now for what's right about sex I you know it's homosexuality right yeah after 2,000 years of people thinking it's wrong is it just right because John Oliver thinks it's right is having sex with a porn star is that wrong because we don't like Donald Trump I mean it's kind of a mess isn't it and you know you know I read this story that there's there now you know they make these sexbots now they're trying to make more and more realistic sex pots and they're now thinking of making child sex pots for pedophiles and somebody wrote an article saying we've got to stop this it's gonna be you know it's gonna be like a an entry gateway drug for pedophiles now we don't know that right we don't know it because for all we don't know whether porn actually inspires pedophiles to commit that affiliate acts or if it relieves them if it gives them a release you know if it gives them a release from their desires and maybe stops it it's it's ugly it's a terrible thing to do how are we going to know how are we gonna know what is the right thing to do if the only way we know is whether comedians are making fun of us or not the only way we know how to judge sex acts ours and others is whether comedians happen to be making fun of it because they dislike Mike Pence and they dislike Donald Trump they have no there's no logic to what they're saying there's no particular you know through line to their morality it's just that their political hatred so how are we going to know and again I just want to go back to the idea that if you do not know what a human being is do not have a sense of your own free will and your own purpose in life there's no possible way to come up with a moral system for sex or for anything else so this this spewing hatred on the left they always accuse us of being hateful racist sexist but this spewing hatred on the left is a sign of their confusion and their lostness and their misunderstanding of the American Way and of the Western Way and it really is not what we should be paying attention to we should be paying attention attention to rebuilding the consensus of what our lives as Westerners and as free men and women are about all right now back tomorrow get your questions in now I will answer as many as I can and my answers will change your life for some of you it will be better for the rest I can not tell you what it's going to be
