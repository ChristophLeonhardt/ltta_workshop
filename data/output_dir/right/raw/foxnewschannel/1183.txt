1
00:00:00,831 --> 00:00:01,432
MOST ADMIRED DEMOCRATIC

2
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:03,968
SENATOR BUT GROW OLD AND

3
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:04,368
IRRELEVANT?

4
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:05,469
NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY WILL BE

5
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:07,604
ASKING YOU NASTY QUESTIONS ABOUT

6
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:09,139
YOUR IMPEACHMENT.

7
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:09,840
BEST-SELLING AUTHOR MARK STEYN

8
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,108
HAS NEVER BEEN IMPEACHED AND AT

9
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:11,775
THIS POINT IT SEEMS FRANKLY

10
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,143
UNLIKELY THAT HE WILL BE BUT HE

11
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:13,777
JOINS US ANYWAY TONIGHT.

12
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:14,912
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

13
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:19,216
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU TUCKER.

14
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:19,917
>> Tucker: SO ALL OF A SUDDEN

15
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:20,985
BILL CLINTON FOR MANY YEARS

16
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:23,387
PROTECTED BY THE PRESS IS UP FOR

17
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:23,687
GRABS.

18
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:28,058
WHAT IS THIS?

19
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:29,126
>> I THINK THERE'S A SENSE, AS

20
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,561
YOU SAID THAT HE IS NOW

21
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:34,264
DISPOSABLE, BUT ALSO AT HIS

22
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:34,965
CURRENT LEVEL I DO THINK THERE

23
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:38,102
IS A GREAT SHAME AT WHAT THE

24
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:42,406
RATIONALE FOR CLINTON IS    IN T

25
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:44,274

00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:44,942
RATIONALE FOR CLINTON IS    IN

'90s.

29
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:47,311
THE MOST INTERESTING MOMENT TO

30
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:48,045
ME, THE MOST HORRIFYING MOMENT

31
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,747
ACTUALLY AND THE MOST PATHETIC

32
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:52,750
AND SELF-SERVING MOMENT IN THIS

33
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,519
TODAY SHOW INTERVIEW COMES WHEN

34
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:56,954
HE PLEADS IN MITIGATION AND IT'S

35
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:57,788
INTERESTING TO LOOK AT HIS

36
00:00:57,788 --> 00:00:58,889
FACIAL EXPRESSION AS HE SAYS

37
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:01,992
THIS THAT I HAD A

38
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:05,396
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY AS

39
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:05,963
GOVERNOR IN THE 1980s.

40
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:08,432
IN OTHER WORDS, THAT'S THE

41
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:10,134
LESSON THE DEMOCRATS TOOK FROM

42
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:14,738
THIS, THAT AS LONG AS YOU STRUCK

43
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:15,739
THE RIGHT ATTITUDES IN PUBLIC,

44
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,241
YOU COULD DO -- TRY THIS IN ANY

45
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:19,743
OTHER ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE.

46
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:22,346
HEY, BUD, YOU ARE DOUBLE PARKED.

47
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:22,946
>> IT'S OKAY, OFFICER.

48
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:26,483
I VOTED FOR THE MUNICIPAL

49
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:28,552
PARKING LOT EXPANSION BILL IN

50
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,487
1973.

51
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:32,623
THAT'S BASICALLY THE ARGUMENT

52
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:36,427
THAT CLINTON IS MAKING HERE

53
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:38,162
BECAUSE HE PASSED THE

54
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:39,663
SEXUAL HARASSMENT BILL IN THE

55
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:40,531
1980s, BECAUSE HE SIGNED ONE

56
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,732
AS GOVERNOR HE IS ALLOWED TO

57
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:44,935
ACTUALLY ASSAULT WOMEN OR ENTER

58
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:48,072
INTO THE GRADING RELATIONSHIPS,

59
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:50,174
SUPPOSEDLY CONSENSUAL

60
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,476
RELATIONSHIPS BUT RUINED IN THE

61
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:56,513
CASE OF MONICA LEWINSKY A YOUNG

62
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:56,947
WOMAN'S LIFE.

63
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:57,648
AND THAT'S THE RATIONALE THAT

64
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:02,519
HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND

65
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,153
SCHNEIDERMAN, THE NEW YORK

66
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:03,854
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ALL THESE

67
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:06,323
OTHERS AND JOHN CONYERS, THE BIG

68
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:09,726
DEMOCRAT BIGSHOT WHO WAS HOSTING

69
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:10,526
TROUSER LIST MEETINGS IN HIS

70
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:13,330
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE.

71
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,532
THEY ARE ALL ACTUALLY FOLLOWING

72
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,633
THAT CLINTON RATIONALE BUT

73
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:17,267
BECAUSE I HAVE THE RIGHT

74
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,636
ATTITUDES IN PUBLIC I CAN DO

75
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:23,107
WHAT I LIKE IN PRIVATE.

76
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:24,575
>> Tucker: HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S

77
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:25,576
DEFENSE WAS I LOVE ABORTION, SO

78
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:28,345
BACK OFF, LEAVE ME ALONE.

79
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:30,547
SO QUENTIN, I CONFESS I FEEL A

80
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,248
LITTLE SORRY FOR BILL CLINTON

81
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,350
BECAUSE IN MY VIEW OF THIS IS

82
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,118
REALLY ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC

83
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:35,919
PARTY CHANGING AND REJECTING ITS

84
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,220
PAST.

85
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,321
BUT I ALSO WONDER AS LONG AS WE

86
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,922
ARE GOING TO HAVE A RECKONING

87
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,491
WITH CLINTON OVER HIS BEHAVIOR,

88
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:41,191
WHEN DID WE GET THE RECKONING

89
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:45,162
WITH ALL OF HIS DEFENDERS IN THE

90
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:45,529
MEDIA?

91
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:46,263
"THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER

92
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:47,030
WHO SAID THAT SHE WOULD GET ON

93
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,667
HER KNEES FOR HIM FOR KEEPING

94
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,568
ABORTION LEGAL.

95
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:52,202
THE FEMINIST LEADERS WHO

96
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,872
ATTACKED MONICA LEWINSKY IN

97
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,740
EFFECT AND DISMISSED THE

98
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,141
ALLEGATIONS.

99
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:57,808
WHEN DO THEY GET THEIR TIME

100
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:00,677
UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT FOR WHAT

101
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:01,411
THEY DID?

102
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:02,646
>> AND I THINK THERE'S ALSO

103
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:03,747
OTHER ONES TOO.

104
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:05,349
THERE WERE ONES WHO DIDN'T

105
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,584
ATTACK MONICA BUT I REMEMBER FOR

106
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:11,455
EXAMPLE BEING ATTACKED IN CANADA

107
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:12,189
BY A FEMINIST COLUMNIST WHO SAYS

108
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,491
YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT -- MONICA

109
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:15,392
ISN'T THE VICTIM HERE.

110
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:16,160
IF SHE'S GOING TO MAKE MILLIONS

111
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,727
OF DOLLARS.

112
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,230
SHE HAS HAD A MISERABLE 20

113
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,531
YEARS.

114
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,600
SHE WAS ESSENTIALLY RUINED AND

115
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,670
TOSSED ASIDE BY BILL CLINTON AND

116
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,072
AS WE SAW IN THIS INTERVIEW HE

117
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,175
THINKS THAT HE IS THE VICTIM

118
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:32,576
HERE AND HE'S OUT, BY THE WAY.

119
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:36,613
HE'S ON A BOOK TOUR PEDDLING

120
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:40,817
THIS NOVEL HE SUPPOSEDLY -- WITH

121
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:45,322
JAMES PATTERSON AND SUPPOSEDLY

122
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:46,356
IS MOST AMBITIOUS WORK OF

123
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,724
FICTION SINCE HIS DEPOSITION IN

124
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:50,694
THE PAULA JONES CASE.

125
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:55,566
CLINTON IS GETTING A BAZILLION

126
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,467
DOLLARS TO PUT HIS NAME TO THIS

127
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:58,735
LUDICROUS NOVEL AND MONICA

128
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:02,339
LEWINSKY IS SOMEONE WHO HAS

129
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,841
NEVER HAD A FULFILLED CAREER,

130
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,344
NEVER HAD A FULFILLED FAMILY

131
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:08,011
LIFE AND THAT DOESN'T MATTER

132
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,880
BECAUSE THE CLINTONS JUST

133
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,149
DISCARD PEOPLE AND MOVE ON TO

134
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,784
THE NEXT BIT OF HUMAN DEBRIS.

135
00:04:13,784 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: AND THE MEDIA GOES
