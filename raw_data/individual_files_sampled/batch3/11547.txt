groups from all sides of the conflict in the Syrian war have been involved in a heated day of talks during the peace summit in the Russian resort of Sochi and it seems they have produced a tangible result artis Murad gazia reports well first of all they've agreed on 12 points 12 points along which a future Syrian state will be built it's it's a guideline the document itself made the rounds at Geneva multiple times but ultimately it got nowhere it was finally signed here and Sochi and it's it's a road map it governs everything from Syrian from Syrian governance itself to Syrian sovereignty to how the military will be overhauled the other big thing that was agreed on is a constitutional reform committee to amend or rewrite the Syrian Constitution the interesting thing here is that seats on it that will be saved for those that were unwilling or unable to attend these talks this will be passed on to the UN's of the UN will oversee this new committee and the UN special envoy for Syria will personally guide this initiative there was also of course drama nobody saw it coming this morning there was no way intimate but from late arrivals to canceled participation even arguments and shouting matches there was even heckling I want to express my sincere gratitude to our colleagues friends again I would like your attention if it's long live Russia then let me speak please there were sides as I mentioned that were unwilling to come to these talks we're talking here about the hard core position the high negotiations committee that is based in Saudi Arabia and compromises many rebel groups they sent a delegation under Turkish pressure reportedly that came to Sochi but they refused to leave the airport they stayed for about ten hours at the airport of Sochi and they took offense at the various banners that were hung up in the city for these talks the Turks tried to get them to come but to no avail nevertheless there were many other parties many denominations ethnicities Christians Yazidis Muslims Sunnis and Shias there's certainly a lot of debates internationally Turkey Russia Iran three big players the guarantors of the astronaut peace process they were all here the Western partners for example the United States they only sent junior representatives and from what we've been told by Sergey Lavrov they haven't displayed much optimism much enthusiasm for this sochi peace peace conference yes it's way more difficult to negotiate when it's not like minded people who sit around the table like in Paris in Washington but opposing sides but agreements achieved by opposing sides are way more stable long lasting and sustainable than those achieved in an inner circle of like-minded States taking decisions for the Syrian people only Syrians can decide the fate of their countries the other thing that organizers and the Russian Foreign Minister wanted to make very clear is that Sochi is no alternative and it is not competitor to the Geneva process the Geneva process will continue under the auspices of the UN controlled by the UN and overseen by the UN and the UN Security Council the UN special envoy for Syria he was here as an observer seeing what was happening seeing the discussions I'm aware that there were intense discussions in this room today and you are proving it this is normal in a democratic environment so it's totally normal we now have the text we have the theory we have the documents that have been signed by everyone what remains to be seen is whether they'll be put into practice you know whether they'll be enforced and what will come of this well the UN special envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura says the sochi meeting offers a unique possibility for political rivals to join in crafting a new constitution we never had the government side and the opposition actually getting involved into the discussion of a new constitution because they were not even agreeing on the ability of creating a Constitutional Commission which then would be left to the UN to set the agenda I think we have reached that point
