♪ ♪ Bret: YOU MAY SOON SEE IN PRICES ON ADVERTISEMENTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, AND I WOULD BE A MAJOR CHANGE FROM THE DRUG INDUSTRY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY MUCH AGAINST IT. SOME ARE FOR IT TO TRY TO DRIVE DRUG PRICES DOWN, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY, THANK YOU FOR COMING. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. Bret: WHAT DOES THE PROPOSAL? WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING IS THAT DRUG COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO PUT THE LIST PRICE OF THEIR DRUGS AND THEIR TV ADS. THAT WAY PEOPLE KNOW HOW MUCH A DRUG COST WHEN THEY GO TO SEE THEIR DOCTOR AND WHETHER IT IS A $50 DRUG, OR A $5,000 DRUG. THEY CAN FACTOR THAT INTO THE DISCUSSION THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE WITH HER DOCTORS. THE PRESIDENT SAID IN MAY HE WANTED TO BRING THIS KIND OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE DRUG INDUSTRY SO THAT HE COULD BRING DRUG PRICES DOWN. HE IS DELIVERING ON THAT TODAY. Bret: IN ADDITION TO THE GUYS WHO TALKS FAST AT THE END OF THE COMMERCIAL AND SAYS COME ALL THESE BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO YOU, BY THE WAY, IT CAN COST $5,000. IT WILL SAY THE RIGHT IMPRINTS. THE MONTHLY COST OF THIS THERAPY WHERE THE COURSE OF THERAPY. Bret: THE PURPOSE BEING, COMPETITION? THE PURPOSE IS COMPETITION, THE PURPOSE IS THE PATIENT AND THE DRIVER'S SEAT WHO IS KNOWLEDGEABLE WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION. WHERE ELSE IN OUR WORLD TO BE GO IN AND TRY TO MAKE A PURCHASING DECISION AND WE DON'T KNOW THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT? WE ARE BRINGING THAT TRANSPARENCY. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION, THEY HAVE FOUGHT US, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS. HE BELIEVES THE PATIENT OUGHT TO BE AT THE CENTER AND HAVE THIS INFORMATION AND DRUG PRICES HAVE TO COME DOWN. Bret: THIS MIDTERM ELECTION, DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE. DRUG PRICES AS WELL, NUMBER TWO ON HEALTH CARE, SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE MORE? 64%. BOX THREE, PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF HEALTH CARE, APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE? 38% APPROVE, WHICH PARTY WOULD DO A BETTER JOB ON HEALTH CARE? DEMOCRATS 49%, TO REPUBLICANS 44%. ARIZONANS, THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEIR HEALTH CARE. SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE BEDS AND THOSE WHO DO ARE PAYING TOO MUC MUCH. IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE WAY WE PAY OR FAIL TO PAY HEALTH CARE IN THIS STATE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN MEDICARE COVERAGE FOR THE ELDERLY, THAT DOES NOT RATE JUST LIVE. WE EXPAND COVERAGE TO INCLUDE TONTO CARE, VISION CARE AND CHEERING. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SENIORS. Bret: TAUGHT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S POINT OF VIEW, WHY VOTERS SHOULD HANDEDLY BE TIME HAND YOU T TIME HAND YOU E TIME HAND YOU B TOWN? PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND BRING MORE CHOICE, MORE TRANSPARENCY AND GIVE THE PATIENT TO THE DRIVER'S SEAT. PEOPLE WHO ARE PROMISING MEDICARE FOR ALL, THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG IDEAS ALL. PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT. MEDICARE ALL IS MEDICARE FOR NON. THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT YOU OBAMACARE. THIS TIME THEY'RE NOT EVEN MAKING THE PROMISE THAT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HEALTH PLAN OR YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. THEY KNOW THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THE 178 MILLION OF US WHO HAVE EMPLOYEE INSURANCE, THAT WOULD GO AWAY UNDER SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS. YOUR DOCTOR, HE WOULD GET TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR BECAUSE YOUR DOCTOR WOULD BELIEVE THESE RATES WE WOULD HAVE A TWO TIER SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE WHERE THEY MOVE INTO A CASH SYSTEM OUTSIDE OF THIS MEDICARE. AMERICAN SENIORS WOULD LOSE HER DOCTORS, THEIR HOSPITALS, THE CARE. Bret: THE DEMOCRATS OF THAT THAT IS ALL SCARE TACTICS, U.S. PEOPLE AND THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION DOING NOW WITH CONGRESS WERE WITHOUT CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC? THE PRESENT HAS BEEN SO COMMITTED TO TRYING TO BRING HEALTH CARE COSTS DOWN, WHETHER IT IS A DRUG COSTS. OR IN HEALTH INSURANCE, WE ARE DEALING WITH A FAILED OBAMACARE PROGRAM. THE FIRST TIME EVER OBAMACARE PLANS OF THE BENCHMARK PREMIUM IS TEN ALMOST 2% UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP BECAUSE HE STABILIZE THE MARKET. IT IS STILL UNAFFORDABLE, I DO STILL INSURANCE PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT BUT HE IS AT LEAST ABLE LIES IN THE PRICE. PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO CAMPAIGNED TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE IS DOING A BETTER JOB MANAGING OBAMACARE THAN THEY BUY WHO WROTE THE BILL. Bret: ONE MORE QUESTION, THE PRESIDENT AND THE INTERVIEW SUGGESTED THAT THE SEPARATION POLICY IS UNDER REVIEW WITH PARENTS AND CHILDREN. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT STANDS? OUR IMMIGRATION POLICIESA OUR IMMIGRATION POLICIESE COMPLETELY BROKEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND CONGRESS HAS GOT TO ACT. THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED ON CONGRESS TO FIX THIS BROKEN SYSTEM. WHAT WE DO IS RECEIVE CHILDREN WHO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY UNACCOMPANIED, MIGRANT CHILDREN WHO COME IN HERE ILLEGALLY. THEY ARE GIVEN TO US TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT WE DO IS WE WORK TO FIND THE DIVIDED SPONSORS, USUALLY THESE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY WHILE THEY AWAIT THEIR ADJUDICATION J THEY AWAIT THEIR ADJUDICATION D THEY AWAIT THEIR ADJUDICATION C THEY AWAIT THEIR ADJUDICATION A THEY AWAIT THEIR ADJUDICATION Y LETTER. WE HAVE 13,000 UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THIS BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT DOES DRUG USE CHILDREN TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY. THEY MAKE THIS HORRIBLE JOURNEY TO TRY TO GET THEM INTO THIS COUNTRY AND THE COMMON ILLEGALLY THEY ARE GIVEN INTO OUR CUSTODY AND WE HAVE TO FIND A PLACE TO PUT THEM. Bret: WITH THEIR PARENTS? NO, THEY COME UNACCOMPANIED. THESE 13,000 ARE KIDS WHO COME
