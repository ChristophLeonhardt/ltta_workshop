1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,370
>>THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO
THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT IN

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,120
THE WAKE OF THE LAS VEGAS
SHOOTING, THEY'VE BEEN TALKED

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,150
ABOUT ON THIS SHOW QUITE A BIT,
THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT SOME

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,890
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT WHICH IS FOR THE VICTIMS

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,150
OF THE SHOOTING WHO WERE TAKEN
TO HOSPITALS, HOW MUCH ARE THEY

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,520
IN FOR IN TERMS OF MEDICAL
EXPENSES WHEN ALL IS SAID AND

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
DONE?

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,730
THERE RECENTLY WAS A
REPORT PUT OUT BY THE

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,920
PEER-REVIEWED HEALTH AFFAIRS
JOURNAL AND IT FOUND --

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:49,770
>>JUST TO 
TELL YOU WHO THEY

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,559
WERE STUDYING IN THIS CASE.

12
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,559
AND

13
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,309
MARKET WATCH ADDS THAT THIS IS
LIKELY AN UNDERESTIMATED FIGURE.

14
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,879
AS IS MENTIONED BY THE WRITERS
OF THE STUDY THIS DOESN'T FOCUS

15
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,070
ON THINGS LIKE REHABILITATION
AND LOST INCOME WHILE YOU ARE

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,600
RECOVERING FROM YOUR INJURIES.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,500
THAT NUMBER IS AROUND $100,000

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,300
FOR BEING THE VICTIM OF A
GUNSHOT AND GOING TO THE

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,300
HOSPITAL.

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,090
WHAT ARE YOUR
REACTIONS TO THAT NUMBER?

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,759
>>IT DOESN'T QUITE FIT WITH THE
ARGUMENT WE MAKE WHEN IT COMES

22
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,579
TO WALL STREET DOING THE SHADY
THINGS THEY DO.

23
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,579
BETTING AGAINST

24
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,560
US, SOME OF THE DAMAGING
BEHAVIOR TO OUR ECONOMY.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
BUT

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,540
WHEN IT COMES TO WALL STREET WE
ALWAYS ARGUE THAT THEY PRIVATIZE

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,670
THE GAINS AND SOCIALIZE THE
LOSSES.

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,149
AND IN THIS CASE WE

29
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,140
AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE
GOVERNMENT FORCING AMERICANS TO

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,009
PAY ANYTHING, BUT WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT PRIVATE U.S. CITIZENS WHO

31
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,210
ARE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE
HAVING TO PAY THE COST

32
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,329
ASSOCIATED WITH INSANELY LAX GUN
REGULATION.

33
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,979
AND THESE TYPES OF

34
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,810
MEDICAL BILLS DESTROY PEOPLE'S
LIVES, AND FAR TOO OFTEN WHEN WE

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,360
TALK ABOUT THE GUN DEBATE WE
FOCUS HEAVILY, AS WE SHOULD, ON

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,710
THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES, BUT
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,220
CONVERSATION ABOUT PEOPLE WHO
WERE SEVERELY INJURED AND WHO

38
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,960
DID HAVE THEIR LIVES CHANGED IN
AN INCREDIBLY DRASTIC WAY

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,060
BECAUSE OF GETTING VICTIMIZED BY
THIS.

40
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,930
>>IT'S SUCH A HEAVY DEBATE,
BECAUSE ONLY WHEN I TALK ABOUT

41
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,201
THINGS LIKE THIS DO I GET DEATH
THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, OR WHEN

42
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,410
I GET PEOPLE THAT GET VERY
VOLATILE, BUT PEOPLE THINK YOU

43
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,310
ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE GUNS
AWAY.

44
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,310
BUT THE REALITY IS

45
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,590
SOMEBODY PAYS THE PRICE
EVENTUALLY.

46
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,590
AND EVEN THAT

47
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,900
COUNTRY SINGER WHO ACTUALLY
STOOD UP AND SAID I WAS WRONG,

48
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,180
ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT GUNS, PEOPLE
AROUND ME HAD GUNS, AND NO ONE

49
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,310
COULD HELP, WAS JUST THE REALITY
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,160
WILLING TO COME TO TERMS UNTIL
THEY ARE PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,720
TRAGEDY.

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,050
BUT THAT'S A DOUBLE
TRAGEDY, TO BE IN RECOVERY AND

53
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,030
STILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING
IN DEBT.

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,520
AND THAT'S THE MEDICAL

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,750
PART, BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS A
MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT TO THIS,

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,050
TO SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO
NEED THERAPY FOR POSTTRAUMATIC

57
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:31,460
STRESS DISORDER, AND THAT IS
ALSO A TRAGEDY AND IT MAKES ME

58
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,040
SO SAD THAT PEOPLE GET SO
VOLATILE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,030
REGULATING GUNS, BUT IT TRICKLES
DOWN INTO PLACES YOU DON'T EVEN

60
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,030
THINK ABOUT.

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,930
AND NOW OVER 500
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

62
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,360
WORRY ABOUT THEIR FINANCES IN
ADDITION TO HEALING PHYSICALLY,

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,650
EMOTIONALLY, AND MENTALLY.

64
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,050
>>FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO MENTION
THAT COUNTRY SINGER WHO SAID I

65
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,250
WAS PERFORMING WHEN IT ALL WENT
DOWN -- THE STATEMENT HE MADE IS

66
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,250
A BRIEF STATEMENT AND ONE THAT
I'M GLAD HAPPENS AT ALL.

67
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,250
WHETHER

68
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,110
YOU DISAGREE OR AGREE, I'M GLAD
IT HAPPENS AT ALL, SOMEONE WHO

69
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,320
LOOKS AT THE FACTS, GOES THROUGH
AN EXPERIENCE, AND READJUSTS

70
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
THEIR POSITION.

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,550
WHAT I WILL SAY
IS THE WAY HE FRAMES IT, HIS

72
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,820
FIRST SENTENCE IS I WAS A FIERCE
PROPONENT OF THE SECOND

73
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,680
AMENDMENT UNTIL LAST NIGHT.

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,790
AND
WHAT IS SO -- ONE OF THE ASPECTS

75
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,690
THAT IS SO SAD FOR ME IS THE
EXTENT TO WHICH THE OTHER SIDE

76
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,590
HAS WON PART OF THE DEBATE BY
MAKING HIM FRAME IT THAT WAY.

77
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,200
LIKE, YOU ARE EITHER A PROPONENT
OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,750
ARE IN FAVOR OF GUN CONTROL.

79
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,760
AND
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO HIM AND

80
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,960
OTHERS LIKE HIM IS THAT THOSE
TWO THINGS AREN'T NECESSARILY AT

81
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,680
ODDS WITH EACH OTHER.

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,740
A LOT OF
RATES THAT WE HAVE ARE LIMITED

83
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,340
IN DECENT, SMART WAYS YOU WOULD
AGREE WITH.

84
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,690
AND I THINK THERE IS

85
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,280
COMMON SENSE GUN LEGISLATION
THAT STILL SAYS THAT AMERICANS

86
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,850
WILL BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY, WHO
ARE ABLE TO BE LICENSED AND

87
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,500
PASSED CERTAIN CHECKS, CAN STILL
HAVE A GUN.

88
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,010
OR IF THEY ARE A

89
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,990
VICTIM OR SUFFERING FROM A
MENTAL ILLNESS OR WHATNOT, WE

90
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,880
CAN STILL DEFEND THE SECOND
AMENDMENT AND RESTRICT WHO

91
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,920
WAS ABLE TO GET A GUN.

92
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,910
>>YOU ARE RIGHT, AND THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE FRAMED THIS ISSUE AS A

93
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,820
BLACK-AND-WHITE ISSUE ARE THE
WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS, THE GUN

94
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,360
MANUFACTURERS, AND THE NRA,
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT AN

95
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,770
INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION ON IT,
THEY WANT TO FRAME ANYONE WHO

96
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,070
WOULD DO ANYTHING, HAS ANY TYPE
OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD LIMIT

97
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,330
THE PROFITABILITY OF THESE
WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS, AS ANTI-

98
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,690
SECOND AMENDMENT INDIVIDUALS,
AND THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE.

99
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,690
NOW,

100
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,980
ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO ARE DON'T
EVEN WANT TO SAY RADICAL, BUT

101
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,990
PEOPLE ON THE EXTREME END OF THE
SPECTRUM WHO SAY WE SHOULD BAN

102
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,990
ALL GUNS?

103
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,770
YES, THOSE PEOPLE
EXIST.

104
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,010
IS THAT REPRESENTATIVE OF

105
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,320
EVERYONE TRYING TO HAVE A
LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION AND

106
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,660
DEBATE ABOUT GUN LEGISLATION?

107
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,330
ABSOLUTELY NOT. AND I'VE BEEN

108
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,100
OPEN ABOUT THAT, I'VE TALKED
ABOUT MY OWN DESIRE TO OWN A

109
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,300
WEAPON FOR SELF DEFENSE.

110
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,780
JUST
BECAUSE I THINK SOMEONE LIKE

111
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,690
PADDOCK SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE
ABILITY TO BUY A PRODUCT THAT

112
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,080
ESSENTIALLY TURNED HIS SUMMIT
AUTOMATIC WEAPON INTO AN

113
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,919
AUTOMATIC WEAPON DOESN'T MEAN
I'M AGAINST THE SECOND

114
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,889
AMENDMENT, IT MEANS I'M
CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN LIVES, I

115
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,510
WANT TO LIMIT AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

116
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,460
WHO LOSE THEIR LIVES WHEN SOME
INSANE PERSON DECIDES THEY WANT

117
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,970
TO OPEN FIRE ON A GROUP OF
PEOPLE.

118
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,370
>>AND THAT STATEMENT IS YOU
AGREEING WITH SOMETHING THAT

119
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,889
MOST PEOPLE AGREE WITH.

120
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,550
IT'S
DIFFICULT IN NEVADA, I READ A

121
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,030
NEWSWEEK ARTICLE THAT REPORTED
THEY HAVE CERTAIN LAWS WHERE

122
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,220
THERE IS VERY LITTLE LIMITATION
ON WHAT YOU HAVE TO REGISTER

123
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,500
WHEN YOU PURCHASE A FIREARM AND
WHATNOT, SO IT'S DIFFICULT BUT

124
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,820
IT COMES DOWN TO A LOT OF
RESEARCH NEEDING TO BE DONE, AND

125
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,900
THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE
SYSTEM WE HAVE THAT DISSUADES

126
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:09,730
RESEARCH FROM BEING DONE, AND
THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE REPORT

127
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,070
EARLIER SAY --

128
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:36,820
>>AND THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON
HOW MUCH RESEARCH CAN BE DONE,

129
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,100
AND IT'S DUE TOO, I FORGET WHAT
THE NAME OF THE AMENDMENT WAS,

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,830
IT'S THE DICKEY AMENDMENT WHICH
WAS PUT ON THE OMNIBUS SPENDING

131
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,630
BILL BACK IN THE 90S, IT SAID
YOU CAN'T TAKE CDC MONEY, CENTER

132
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,490
FOR DISEASE CONTROL MONEY, WHICH
IS INVOLVED WITH ALLOCATING

133
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,630
FUNDS IN ORDER TO RESEARCH
PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS, AND IT

134
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,100
SAYS YOU CAN'T USE IT IN ORDER
TO DO RESEARCH THAT COULD

135
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,600
CONTRIBUTE IN SOME TANGENTIAL
WAY TO GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION.

136
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,860
>>THE GUN LOBBY DOESN'T WANT
THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE.

137
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,750
>>BUT IT'S SO DIFFICULT.

138
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,290
THERE'S
AN AMAZING VIDEO WHERE PRESIDENT

139
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:41,889
OBAMA --

140
00:08:41,889 --> 00:09:01,369
HIS NAME 

141
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:13,839
IS ON THE OMNIBUS
BILL, AND IF

142
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,000
HE CAN CHANGE HIS MIND ON
THIS, THEN ANYONE CAN.

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,850
>>ANYONE CAN AS LONG AS THEY ARE
NOT INFLUENCED BY THAT MONEY

144
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,970
FROM THE NRA, FROM THE GUN
LOBBY.

145
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,660
IT'S A POWERFUL FORM OF

146
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,610
CONTROLLING LAWMAKERS, AND THAT
IS THE ONE AND ONLY REASON, THE

147
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,161
MAIN REASON, THE PRIMARY REASON
WHY OUR LAWMAKERS, SOME

148
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,920
DEMOCRATS INCLUDED, REFUSED TO
DO ANYTHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

149
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,819
>>AND IT'S SUCH AN EMOTIONAL
ARGUMENT, IT'S LIKE A MASS

150
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:51,189
HYSTERIA, BECAUSE THEY TIED IN
PATRIOTISM WITH OWNING A GUN. IS

151
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:56,420
A COMEDIAN WE WERE DIRECTLY
AFFECTED BY THAT NRA AD THAT WAS

152
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,540
VERY VOLATILE BECAUSE THEY
ACTUALLY MENTIONED COMEDY CLUBS.

153
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,300
THAT WE WERE LIKE THE ENEMY OF
THE NRA.

154
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
BECAUSE THE NRA CAME

155
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,379
FOR US, SO THE VOLATILITY IN
COMEDY CLUBS HAS INCREASED AND

156
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,079
NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE

157
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,269
POTENTIALLY HAVING A GUN THAT
DOESN'T LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO

158
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,079
SAY, AND CONSIDER WHAT WE SAY TO
BE UN-AMERICAN.

159
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,079
BECAUSE NOW

160
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,119
EVERYTHING IS EITHER PRO OR
ANTI-AMERICAN, IF YOU KNEEL YOUR

161
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:26,180
ANTI-AMERICAN, IF YOU SHOOT GUNS
YOU ARE PRO AMERICAN TO THIS

162
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,920
TYPE OF MENTALITY, BUT IT'S
SCARY FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE

163
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,839
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY
EXERCISING OUR AMERICAN RIGHTS,

164
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,410
I HAVE PEOPLE PUT ON MY FACEBOOK
PAGE THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST

165
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,370
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE
CAN OWN GUNS IN CASE THE

166
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,110
MILITARY COMES TO GET US.

167
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,230
>>THIS IS NOT THE GREATEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, YOU HAVE

168
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,879
BEEN MISLED BY JINGOISTIC
PROPAGANDA.

169
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,879
IT'S NOT THE

170
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,800
GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
BECAUSE WE HAVE LAWMAKERS WHO

171
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,779
ARE COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE IN
LEADING, AND PROTECTING OUR

172
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,269
FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE A
GOVERNMENT THAT'S DISGUSTINGLY

173
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:05,490
CORRUPT, WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT
THAT PURPOSELY PUTS OUR SOLDIERS

174
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,480
IN HARM'S WAY MERELY FOR THE
PROFIT OF WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS

175
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,540
AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THIS IS
NOT THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE

176
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,519
WORLD.

177
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,410
TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
STATISTICS IN EDUCATION,

178
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,949
HEALTHCARE, ALL OF THE
ESSENTIALS IN LIFE COMPARED TO

179
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:22,949
OTHER COUNTRIES.

180
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,910
WE ARE NOT THE
BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, I

181
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,350
THINK THE IDEA OF AMERICA IS
INCREDIBLE BUT WE DON'T FOLLOW

182
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,129
THROUGH WITH THAT IDEA.

183
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,699
WE LIKE
TO SWING IT AROUND AND PRETEND

184
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,699
AS IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE VALUE
BUT WE JUST TALK ABOUT THE IDEA

185
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:39,959
OF AMERICA, WE DON'T PUT ACTION
BEHIND IT.

186
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,350
THAT MIGHT HAVE HURT

187
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,889
SOME PEOPLE'S FEELINGS BUT THAT
IS WHAT IS GOING ON.

188
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:46,980
>>I GET YOUR RHETORICAL STANCE
AND WHAT YOU WERE SAYING

189
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,360
IT, BUT YOUR DOG IS NOT THE BEST
DOG IN THE WORLD BUT YOU

190
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,810
STILL LOVE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE.

191
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,209
>>THAT'S A GREAT WAY OF PUTTING
IT.

192
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,639
>>BUT THE REALITY IS IF THE
MILITARY COMES FOR YOU, DO

193
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,089
YOU THINK YOU HAVE A SHOT?

194
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,899
>>BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S THIS
FANTASY.

195
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,199
>>THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

196
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,540
>>BECAUSE YOUR GUN SAFE IS IN
THE SAME ROOM WHERE YOU WATCH

197
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
300.

198
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,440
YOU ARE LIKE, YEAH, I COULD
TAKE DOWN PERSIA OR THE

199
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
EQUIVALENT.

200
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,300
>>REAL QUICK, GOING BACK TO THE
DEATH THREATS YOU ARE GETTING

201
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,129
FROM GUN ADVOCATES, I MEAN, IF
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE

202
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:32,029
ARGUMENT THAT WE NEED LOOSER GUN
RESTRICTIONS AND THEN THEY

203
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:38,639
SIMULTANEOUSLY THREATEN YOUR
LIFE, I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL LIKE

204
00:12:38,639 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ARE BEING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
A LITTLE BIT.
