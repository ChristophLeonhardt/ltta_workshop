EMILY: I'M EMILY CHANG, AND THIS
IS "BLOOMBERG WEST."
UBER HITS THE GAS ON ITS PUSH
INTO SELF DRIVING CARS.
ALL THE DETAIL ON THE COMPANY'S
BIGGEST ACQUISITION TO DATE AND
ITS DRIVERLESS CAR PILOT IN
PITTSBURGH.
CAN APPLE CUT ITS SMART WATCH
FREE FROM THE IPHONE?
AND, 10 CENTIMES UP WITH A NEW
INNOVATOR IN HOLLYWOOD.
WE WILL SPEAK TO SPF
ENTERTAINMENT ABOUT THEIR LATEST
ASIAN BACKER.
FIRST COME INTO OUR LEAD.
COOPER USERS IN DOWNTOWN
PITTSBURGH WILL BE ABLE TO
SUMMON A SELF DRIVING CAR THIS
MONTH.
GETTING A SELF DRIVING, RIGHT
HAILING FLEET ON THE ROAD FIRST.
UBER STARTING WITH A SPECIALLY
MODIFIED VOLVO SUV'S.
WE KNOW UBER BOUGHT THE SELF
DRIVING TRUCKS START UP AUTO
THIS MONTH FOR AN UNDISCLOSED
AMOUNT.
JOINING US TO DISCUSS, R
BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, 
AND ONE WHO WROTE THIS EXCLUSIVE
STORY FOR "BLOOMBERG
BUSINESSWEEK."
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING A JUDGE HAS
DENIED UBER'S SETTLEMENT WITH
CALIFORNIA DRIVERS IN THE
THREE-YEAR-OLD LAWSUIT OVER
WHETHER OR NOT DRIVERS SHOULD BE
TREATED AS EMPLOYEES OR
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.
IT LOOKS LIKE EVEN THOUGH UBER
LOST THE SETTLEMENT, IT'S GOOD
FOR UBER.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANS?
>> UBER IS LOCKED IN THIS
ONGOING DISCUSSION OVER WHAT ITS
DRIVERS ARE.
ARE THEY EMPLOYEES, ARE THE
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, SMALL
BUSINESSMAN OR WOMEN?
THE CONVERSATION WILL KEEP
GOING, WHICH EVEN IF THE
SETTLEMENT HAD GONE THROUGH,
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
ISSUES, MORE COURT THINGS, MORE
LAWSUITS, ETC..
IT'S NOT A HUGE BIT OF NEWS BUT
IT DOES SHOW THIS IS A PROBLEM
THAT UBER WILL FACE FOR SOME
TIME.
EMILY: HOW DOES IT GIVE UBER THE
UPPER HAND?
>> I SUPPOSE BECAUSE WHAT
HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO, A
JUDGE WANTED UBER'S DRIVERS TO
BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF
ARBITRATION.
HE WAS SAYING HE WOULD NOT
APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT WITHOUT
THIS CLAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE
ALLOWED THEM TO GET OUT OF
ARBITRATION.
UBER SAID NO, WE WILL WALK AWAY
FROM THE DEAL IF YOU DO THAT.
THEY WON'T HAVE BEEN FORCED TO
BE IN ARBITRATION SITUATIONS.
EMILY: FASCINATING STORY YOU
BROKE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT UBER
PUSHING THE SELF DRIVING CARS,
PEOPLE IN PITTSBURGH WILL BE
ABLE TO RIDE IN A SELF DRIVING
UBER VOLVO THIS MONTH.
TELL US THE DETAILS.
>> THE ACQUISITION OF AUTO, WE
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF
PRICE.
IT WAS $680 MILLION, ONE OF THE
BIGGEST DEAL IN THE IN
PITTSBURGH, UBER WILL BE
LAUNCHING ITS PILOT PROGRAM,
RIGHT NOW, IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF
WEEKS, WHERE RIDERS AT RANDOM
WILL BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THIS
NEW ERA.
PEOPLE WILL BE EXPERIENCING IT
WITH A TEST DRIVER AND ALSO WITH
A KIND OF COPILOT, A GUIDE THERE
TAKING NOTES.
IT'S VERY, VERY EARLY, BUT IT'S
EXCITING.
I RODE IN ONE OF THESE A COUPLE
WEEKS BACK.
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE.
EMILY: I RODE IN A GOOGLE SELF
DRIVING CAR 4 YEARS AGO, BUT THE
TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED SO MUCH.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON ALL THIS?
>> IT'S STUNNING.
UBER IS IN PITTSBURGH SO SOON.
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED BY THAT,
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IF I WOULD
WANT TO BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE TO
RIDE IN THEM.
UBER HAS PUT ALL THIS MONEY INTO
ITS PITTSBURGH LABS, WHERE THEY
HIRE THESE PEOPLE AWAY FROM
CARNEGIE MELLON.
IT FEELS TO ME THAT THEY MAY BE
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE OUTCOME OF
THAT AND THAT'S WHY THEY FELT
THEY HAD TO BUY AUTO.
IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE WAY
THEY'RE DESCRIBING IT THAT AUTO
WILL BE THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF
UBER'S SOME DRIVING EFFORTS,
WHICH MIGHT BE A NEGATIVE FOR
THOSE PEOPLE ALL THE WAY IN
PITTSBURGH.
MAYBE THEY ARE SALVAGING THEIR
SELF-RESPECT BY DEPLOYING CARS
IN THEIR HOMETOWN.
EMILY: YOU SPECIFICALLY RESEARCH
DECISION-MAKING BY HUMANS VERSUS
MACHINES.
I WE LETTING -- ARE WE READY TO
LET ROBOTS TAKE THE WHEEL?
OUR ROBOTS READY FOR THE
CHALLENGE?
>> THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT
ESTABLISHING TRUST.
I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS
EXTENSIVELY, WHEN SHOULD WE
TRUST MACHINES WITH DECISIONS.
THIS IS A BOLD MOVE BY UBER.
THEY ARE GOING OUT OF THE
SIMULATION MODE AND PUTTING THIS
OUT THERE INTO THE REAL WORLD.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO ESTABLISH
TRUST WITH CONSUMERS AND EVEN
MORE IMPORTANTLY, TRUST WITH
REGULATORS WHO REALLY NEED TO BE
CONVINCED THAT THIS THING WORKS
AND IT'S BETTER FOR SOCIETY AND
IT DOESN'T IMPOSE HUGE RISKS ON
INDIVIDUALS.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT,
WHICH IS TO PUT IT OUT THERE.
THIS IS BRILLIANT BECAUSE IT
PUTS THEM IN A POSITION WHERE
THEY GATHER REALLY VALUABLE DATA
THAT OTHERS DON'T HAVE, SO IT
GIVES THEM THAT FIRST MOVER
ADVANTAGE OF GATHERING DATA FROM
VEHICLES OPERATING IN THE REAL
WORLD.
AND THAT'S DIFFERENT, AND THEY
NEED TO DO THAT TO ESTABLISH
TRUST, WHICH IS KEY FOR THESE
KINDS OF SYSTEMS.
EMILY: HOW WILL THIS WORK?
DO USERS OPT INTO WANTING TO BE
PICKED UP BY A SELF DRIVING CAR,
OR DOES ONE SHOW UP?
>> YOU OPT IN, AND USE THE
PLATFORM NORMALLY.
IT'S LIKE BEING CALLER NUMBER
100.
YOU GET AN ALERT SAYING, YOU
WILL BE IN A SELF DRIVING CAR.
HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
LUGGAGE, BECAUSE THE SELF
DRIVING CARS HAVE GIANT
COMPUTERS IN THE TRUNK.
THERE ARE PRACTICAL
CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL.
ONE THING THAT'S REALLY
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS UBER SELF
DRIVING THING IS THE DATA ANGLE,
WHICH IS THAT UBER HAS DRIVEN
MANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, I
GUESS ILION'S OF -- BILLIONS OF 
MILES.
THEY ARE SAYING THEY MAY BE ABLE
TO USE THE DATA THEY'RE HUMAN
DRIVERS ARE COLLECTING TO TRAIN
THE ROBOTS, WHICH IS KIND OF AN
EXCITING THING FOR PEOPLE WHO
ARE DEEP IN THE SPACE.
>> THTA'S KEY -- THAT'S KEY.
IN THE WORLD WORLD, YOU GET EDGE
CASES.
OTHER PEOPLE REFER TO THEM AS
RUMSFELDIAN UNKNOWNS.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THESE MACHINES
EXPERIENCE AS MUCH OF THAT AS
POSSIBLE, AND IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE
WHEN THEY DRIVE IN THE REAL
WORLD.
THE OTHER THING THAT HASN'T BEEN
TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS UBER
GETTING BACK INTO CHINA, IN A
WAY, BECUASE -- BECAUSE VOLVO IS
REALLY OWNED BY KEELEY.
EMILY: INTERESTING POINT, ON THE
BACK OF THEM SELLING THEIR CHINA
BUSINESS TO THEIR BIGGEST RATTLE
-- RIVAL IN CHINA.
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND
ME WHO MAY NOT OPT INTO THIS
RIGHT AWAY WHO ARE ON THE ROAD
AND DID NOT CHOOSE TO BE DRIVING
NEXT TO A SELF DRIVING UBER
VOLVO?
>> THAT'S RELATED TO THE
QUESTION RUNNING THROUGH MY
HEAD, WHICH IS THAT THEY BETTER
HOPE NOTHING GOES WRONG HERE.
TESLA WAS CLAIMING THEY HAD MORE
DATA ABOUT SELF DRIVING BECAUSE
THEY HAVE ALL THESE CARS ON THE
ROAD.
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN TESLA
HAD ONE ACCIDENT THAT WAS
PROBABLY QUITE PREDICTABLE, BUT
THESE OVERLY VALUED COMPANIES,
WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, THEY
ALMOST HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY
PRESSURE TO PROVE THEY CAN DO
THESE THINGS.
THAT MEANS THEY ARE IN A
PERILOUS POSITION IF THEY GO
WRONG.
FROM EVERYTHING I HEAR, THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO GET THOSE TWO
PEOPLE OUT OF THE FRONT SEAT
ANYTIME SOON.
IF THEY DID, THEY MIGHT BE
INVITING DISASTER.
EMILY: WE WILL CONTINUE TO
FOLLOW THIS.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH
COMPETITORS LIKE TESLA AND
GOOGLE.

SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT EXCEEDED

YOU WILL HEAR FROM ONE OF THOSE
RIVALS TOMORROW, THE VICE
PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS.
HE WILL JOIN US TO TALK ABOUT
DECLINING SMARTPHONE SALES IN
CHINA AND THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL
EXPANSION STRATEGY.
APPLE IS HITTING SOME SNAGS IN
SEVERING ITS WATCH FROM THE
IPHONE.
CURRENTLY IN ORDER FOR THE APPLE
WATCH TO WORK, YOU NEED TO HAVE
YOUR IPHONE CLOSE BY.
THE COMPANY STILL PLANS TO
ANNOUNCE NEW MODELS THIS FALL
WITH IMPROVEMENTS TO HELP
TRACKING, BUT THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO CONNECT INDEPENDENTLY TO
CELLULAR NETWORKS.
JOIN ME TO DISCUSS, MY COHOST,
AND MARK GURMAN, WHO BROKE THE
STORY FOR BLOOMBERG NEWS.
WHAT DO WE KNOW?
>> WE KNOW THIS APPLE WATCH WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO
NETWORKS FROM AT&T, VERIZON,
ETC. AND INTERNATIONALLY.
APPLE PLANS TO COME OUT WITH A
NEW VERSION THIS YEAR THAT CAN
CONNECT TO CELLULAR NETWORKS.
THEY HIT SOME SNAGS RELATED TO
ENGINEERING, RELATED TO THE
BATTERY LIFE.
THE CELLULAR CHIPS OF TODAY'S
AGE CONSUME TOO MUCH POWER FOR
AN APPLE WATCH, A SMALL SIZED
WATCH.
THE TRADE-OFF WAS TOO LARGE TO
HAVE THAT IN THERE BECAUSE THE
BATTERY WOULD DRAIN TOO QUICKLY
FOR THE USERS.
EMILY: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
>> I THINK IT'S NOT SHOCKING.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN
LOOKING AT IS, WHAT IS THE MODEM
TECHNOLOGY GOING TO BE BEHIND
THIS RATE WE HAVE BEEN HEARING
APPLE IS WORKING ON THEIR OWN
MODEM TECHNOLOGY.
THE COMPUTER ON THE WATCH IS --
THEY WOULD NEED TO DESIGN A
MDOEM ONTO THAT -- MODEM ONTO
THAT.
I HAD BEEN HEARING THAT WAS
DELAYED FOR SOME OF THE REASONS
THAT MARK SAID, WE WERE NOT ON
THE SAME TRACK.
WE SEE WITH EXISTING WATCH
OWNERS, WE HAVE RESEARCH DATA
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY WANT
THAT FEATURE.
IT'S A REALLY QUESTION, LIKE
WHERE IS THE VALUE IN IT, IS IT
A NECESSITY.
GPS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO BE
IN THE PRODUCT.
THE MODEM, I'M NOT SURE.
HE WOULD BE A NICE FEATURE, BUT
I'M NOT SURE THAT IS WHY SOMEONE
WOULD GO OUT AND BUY.
EMILY: WILL THE NEW WATCHES BE
UNVEILED AT THE SEPTEMBER 7
EVENT?
>> WE KNOW THERE WILL BE A NEW
WATCH UNVEILED THIS FALL,
WITHOUT THE CELLULAR.
EMILY: WHAT WILL BE NEW ABOUT
THEM?
>> NEW HEALTH TRACKING FEATURES.
PARTLY THAT WILL BE BECAUSE OF A
NEW GPS CHIP.
GPS RIGHT NOW IS IN THE IPHONE.
IF YOU WANT THE MOST ACCURATE
DATA FOR RUNNING AND WALKING,
YOU HAVE TO EITHER CALIBRATE FOR
A 20 MINUTE PROCESS OR BRING THE
PHONE WITH YOU.
NOW THE GPS WILL BE BUILT INTO
THE WATCH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU CAN GET CONSISTENTLY
ACCURATE DATA WITH EVERY
WORKOUT.
EMILY: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW
THE WATCH IS ACTUALLY SELLING?
YOU'VE HAD MORE POSITIVE
ANALYSIS THAN SOME OTHERS.
HOW ARE WATCHES SELLING?
>> IT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE
THEY ARE WAITING TO THE FALL TO
UPDATE THIS PRODUCT THAT HAS
BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR OVER A
YEAR, VERSUS IF THEY HAD DONE A
REFRESH IN THE SPRING WE WOULD
SEE MORE OPTIMISTIC SALES GOING
INTO THE MOMENTUM OF THIS YEAR.
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THIS
CATEGORY IN GENERAL BUT
PARTICULARLY WATCHES, CLEARLY
IT'S A HOLIDAY PRODUCT.
IT MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT
REFRESH.
FOR ME, THIS IS ALL ABOUT CAN
THEY GROW SALES TO NEW
CUSTOMERS.
THERE'S A LOT OF TECHIES AND
EARLY ADOPTERS.
CAN THEY BRING IT TO NORMAL
PEOPLE?
WHAT PRICE POINTS DO THEY GET
TO?
DO THEY DO MUCH ON DESIGN?
THESE ARE THE THINGS STRAIGHT WE
STILL SEE MOST OF THIS BEING A
FITNESS AND HEALTH MARKET.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT EXPANDED
IS SOME OTHER USE CASES.
THAT'S WHERE THE NEW SOFTWARE,
NEW DEVELOPERS MIGHT EXPAND IT.
WE STILL THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
HEADROOM IN THIS MARKET, AND
THERE'S AN EVOLUTION FOR
WATCHES.
I DO THINK IT IS GOING SLOWER
THAN WE THOUGHT.
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION, WHAT IS
THE SIZE OF THE MARKET.
EMILY: DAVID?
>> I ALWAYS THOUGHT APPLE
OVERPLAY THE FASHION PART OF THE
WATCH.
ONE OF THE REASONS THERE ISN'T
THAT MUCH DEMAND FROM NON-TECH
IES IS THAT THEY HAVEN'T
EXPLAINED IT VERY WELL.
I WENT TO THE DINNER LAST NIGHT
I WAS HOSTING, VERY BUSY.
SOMEBODY WAS UNHAPPY SOMEWHERE
IN THE ROOM AND I GOT A TEXT
MESSAGE ON MY WATCH AND IT
REALLY HELPED ME DO MY JOB IN A
WAY I COULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE.
I THINK ISRAEL BENEFITS TO THE
WATCH -- THERE'S REAL BENEFITS
TO THE WATCH THAT ARE NOT
UNDERSTOOD.
IT SEEMS TO ME MORE THAN IT WAS
WORTH OF TO THAT POINT.
ABOUT THE BATTERY, THIS IS THE
THING THAT'S HOLDING BACK THIS
ENTIRE INDUSTRY, WHEN OF THE
REASONS IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE
WATCH.
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FAIRLY
BIG SCREEN.
THERE ARE WATCHES OUT THERE THAT
CONNECT TO CELL PHONE NETWORKS
PERFECTLY FINE.
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE AS MANY
FEATURES.
IT'S APPLE'S DESIRE TO HAVE IT
ALL AT A TIME WHEN BATTERY
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT MOVING FORWARD
QUICKLY ENOUGH.
IT'S THE ONE THING I KEEP
FINDING DISAPPOINTING ABOUT
APPLE AND HIS PREDICTIONS OF
WHAT THE NEXT IPHONE IS GOING TO
BE, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE
DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN BATTERY
LIFE, WHICH IS THE ONE FEATURE
THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT.
EMILY: BATTERY TECHNOLOGY HAS
NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN A
CENTURY.
>> I WENT TO THE LUNCH OF THIS
PHONE THE OTHER DAY.
THEY HAVE AMAZING TECHNOLOGIES
BUILT INTO THEIR PHONE TO EXTEND
THE BATTERY LIFE, TO HELP YOU
MANAGE THE BATTERY, THAT I THINK
WILL GIVE SOME PHONES AND
ADVANTAGE.
IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED.
EMILY: QUICK THOUGHTS?
>> ON THE WATCH ASIDE, IT'S
POSITIVE.
WE CONTINUE TO SEE EXISTING
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BE HIGH.
THAT HASN'T CHANGED.
THE BATTERY AND DESIGN STUFF, WE
ARE IN A DIFFERENT CYCLE IN THIS
INDUSTRY.
I THINK THAT FOR US IS THE KEY
THING TO KEEP OBSERVING.
EMILY: AS ALWAYS, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL FOR JONIING --
JOINING US.

IS TIME FOR SERIES A, OUR WEEKLY
ROUNDTABLE ON INVESTING.
THIS WEEK WHERE FOCUSED ON
FUNDING CONSTRUCTION ACROSS THE
MEDIA INDUSTRY.
WE HAVE SEEN NOW ESTABLISHED
PLAYERS LIKE NETFLIX AND AMAZON
STUDIOS BRING TV INTO THE
ON-DEMAND ERA.
NOW THE UP-AND-COMING HOLLYWOOD
STUDIO ONCE IN -- WANTS IN.
IT RECENTLY RAISE NEW FUNDS TO

HAVE FAILED?
JOINING ME TO DISCUSS STX
ENTERTAINMENT IS THE CEO, AND
THE COFOUNDER OF STX.
IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING
PARTNERSHIP YOU GUYS HAVE.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS?
>> WHEN BILL AND I FIRST CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA FOR THIS, WE
REALIZED IF YOU ARE GOING TO
BUILD AN ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY
TODAY, IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK
LIKE THE ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY
THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW.
THEIR BUSINESS MODELS ARE 100
YEARS OLD AND A LOT OF THINGS
THEY'VE DONE -- WE SAID, IF WE
ARE GOING TO BUILD A COMPANY
TODAY, A, IT'S GOING TO LOOK
VERY DIFFERENT, AND B, CHINA
WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF ITS
DNA.
WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO BUILD A
COMPANY THAT TRIED TO PUSH ITS
PRODUCT INTO CHINA, WE INSTEAD
ARE GOING TO HAVE IT AS SORT OF
A BRIDGE WHERE IT IS LITERALLY
PART OF THE DNA.
EMILY: HOW ARE YOU DOING THINGS
DIFFERENTLY FROM TRADITIONAL
STUDIOS?
>> THE MAIN THING IS TO DO WITH
THE PRODUCT MIX.
THE SIX MAJOR STUDIOS HAVE
CHANGED THEIR FILMS TO BEING
FEWER BUT MORE EXPENSIVE,
CLASSIC SEQUELS, REMAKES AND
FRANCHISE FILMS, WHICH IS
EXACTLY WHAT THEY SHOULD BE
DOING.
THEY CREATED THIS INTERESTING
VACUUM IN THE MIDDLE, $20
MILLION TO $80 MILLION PRICE
RANGE WHERE YOU HAVE A STAR IN A
SIGNATURE ROLE.
WE KNOW THAT TO BE A PROFITABLE
AREA.
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE WEREN'T
BURDENED WITH LEGACY DEALS OR
MASSIVE OVERHEAD, WE WERE ABLE
TO GO AFTER THAT SPACE.
"BAD MOMS" IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT
WE HOPE TO DO OVER AND OVER
AGAIN.
EMILY: IS "BAD MOMS" A GOOD
EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING YOU ARE
DOING DIFFERENTLY?
IF NOT, WHAT ARE THE MOVIES THAT
EXEMPLIFY THIS STRATEGY?
>> "BAD MOMS" IS EXACTLY WHAT WE
ARE TRYING TO DO, A $20 MILLION
FILM THAT SHOULD DO $200 MILLION
BOX OFFICE WORLDWIDE.
IT'S A NUMBER OF IDENTIFIABLE
COMEDIANS IN A COMEDY.
IT IS THESE ACTRESSES THE WAY
YOU WANT TO SEE THEM.
AS A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT
OFFSHOOTS, TV AND SHORT FORM WE
CAN DO.
>> THE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD
TO THAT, WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY
IS OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SEE A MOVIE
LIKE "BAD MOMS," WE BUILT THIS
COMPANY FROM THE BEGINNING WITH
AN EYE TO CHINA.
CHINA WILL WITHIN FOUR YEARS BE
THE LARGEST MEDIA MARKET IN THE
WORLD.
WE BROUGHT IN THIS -- SOME OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT CHINESE
PARTNERS.
FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAD
CHINESE PARTNERS WE BROUGHT IN.
THE NOTION WAS TO BUILD CONTENT
THAT WAS LEVERAGED MORE GLOBALLY
FROM THE OUTSET WITH PARTNERS
THAT COULD HELP INFORM ON THE
CHINA SIDE, WHEN THEY WERE
LOOKING FOR IN MEDIA AS WELL.
EMILY: THE ENTERTAINMENT
OPPORTUNITY IN CHINA AS WELL IS
CLEAR.
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES,
AND DEALING WITH THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT AND THE THINGS THEY
WANT THEIR PEOPLE TO SEE.
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THAT BALANCE
BETWEEN MAKING COMPROMISES TO
GET YOUR STUFF INTO CHINA AND
BEING TRUE TO THE ART?
>> THE KINDS OF CONTENT WE ARE
MAKING, WHETHER MOVIES, TV, IT'S
DESIGNED FOR GLOBAL AUDIENCE.
IT'S NOT DESIGNED EXPLICITLY FOR
CHINA.
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE MOVIES FOR
THE WHOLE WORLD.
AS FOR BEING ABLE TO CRACK THE
CHINESE MARKET, AS BILL SAID,
TPG GROWTH INCUBATED THIS
COMPANY.
IT WAS LITERALLY JUST AN IDEA
THAT TWO YEARS LATER WE WILLED
INTO BEING, BUT ONE OF THE FIRST
PEOPLE WE WENT TO WAS ONE OF
CHINA'S LARGEST PE SHOPS.
HE'S BEEN A SPECTACULAR PARTNER
IN HELPING TO TEST AND NAVIGATE
HOW THINGS SHOULD WORK THERE.
TPG IS ALSO REALLY SUCCESSFUL,
ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS IN CHINA.
THIS IS WHERE COMPANIES LIKE 10
SENT COME IN.
WHILE WE HAVE TRIED TO DO IS
ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE BEST
THINKERS WHO CAN -- UNLIKE A
NORMAL AMERICAN COMPANY THAT IS
TRYING TO RETROACTIVELY PUSH
THEIR STUFF IN, WE PROACTIVELY
TRY TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE
MARKET, AND THAT'S WHAT
HOPEFULLY GIVES US AN EDGE.
EMILY: A LOT OF THIS NEW FUNDING
WILL BE USED TOWARDS NEW TV
PROJECTS.
WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES YOU
SEE IN TV WHEN HE HAVE AMAZON,
NETFLIX SPENDING SO MUCH ON
ORIGINAL CONTENT?
YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAYING, WE ARE
IN A TV BUBBLE.
WE ARE BALLOONING INTO
OVERSUPPLY AND THAT BALLOON WILL
EVENTUALLY DEFLATE.
I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THERE IS
GREATER SUPPLY OF TV THAN CAN BE
PRODUCED PROFITABLY.
>> JUST LIKE THE MOVIE BUSINESS,
THERE'S TELEVISION CONTENT THAT
WOULD NOT BE PROFITABLE AND IF
YOU PRODUCE THE RIGHT TELEVISION
CONTENT, IT CAN BE WILDLY
PROFITABLE.
HULU, AMAZON, NETFLIX ARE DOING
THE DOUBLING IN INVESTMENT
THEY'VE MADE BETWEEN LAST YEAR
AND THIS YEAR IN ORIGINAL
CONTENT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT
THE WAY WE CONSUME TV IS
DIFFERENT RIGHT WHEN WE GREW UP,
IT WAS A LINEAR BROADCASTING
MODALITY.
THE ONLY THING LEFT THAT IS
LINEAR IS SPORTS.
PEOPLE WILL SIGN ON TO THEIR
TELEVISION TO WATCH A SPORTING
EVENT, BUT THE REST OF CONTENT
TELEVISION IS A DIFFERENT FORM
OF MEDIA, AND THE LINES HAVE
REALLY BLURRED.
YOU SEE A LIST ARTISTS DOING AN
INDIVIDUAL EPISODE OF "GAME TO
THRONES".
THE QUALITY OF IT IS LIKE THAT
OF A MOVIE.
YOU NO LONGER HAD THE TELEVISION
COMEDY RUNT OF THE LITTER WITH
HOLLYWOOD LOT BUSTERS BEING THE
HIGH QUALITY -- BLCOKBUSTERS
BEING THE HIGH QUALITY --
BLOCKBUSTERS BEING THE HIGH
QUALITY.
CHINA AND INDIA AND OTHER
EMERGING MARKETS HAVING SHOWN UP
MAKES FOR A FASCINATING
LANDSCAPE TO INVEST.
IT STILL HAS TO BE GOOD CONTENT.
IF YOU THROW LOUSY PRODUCTION
OUT THERE, IT WON'T SUCCEED.
EMILY: WHAT KIND OF TV DO YOU
WANT TO DO?
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
WHAT IS TV, IS WHAT WE ARE
GRAPPLING WITH.
IT USED TO BE MOVIES WERE 90
MINUTES, IF YOU'RE TELLING A
STORY IT'S 90 MINUTES AND IT
WILL PROBABLY BE A MOVIE.
IF IT'S 22 MINUTES, IT WILL
PROBABLY BE TV.
NOW IT'S 2 MINUTES ON FACEBOOK
OR 6 SECONDS ON SNAPCHAT.
WE ARE TRYING TO AGGREGATE THE
WORLD'S BEST STORYTELLERS AND
BIGGEST MOVIE STAR BRANDS WHO
ARE INCREDIBLY INTERESTED IN
TRYING TO TELL STORIES ACROSS
ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS.
WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE THIS
FRICTIONLESS CREATIVE EXPERIENCE
WHERE THEY CAN TELL THEIR
STORIES ACROSS ALL THESE
DIFFERENT PLATFORMS AND FIGURE
OUT WHICH IS THE BEST WAY TO GO,
BUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS
ALL THESE LINES ARE COMPLETELY
BLURRING.
THE KIND OF TV WERE DOING, THEY
ARE STARS IN SIGNATURE ROLES.
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A
LOT MORE OVERLAPPING AND A LOT
MORE BREAKING DOWN OF THOSE
BARRIERS IN THE LAST 3 OR 4
YEARS.
EMILY: ALL RIGHT.
WE WILL CONTINUE THIS
CONVERSATION AFTER A QUICK
BREAK.
♪
EMILY: WELCOME BACK TO
"BLOOMBERG WEST."
HERE WITH ME STILL, STX CEO AND
CO-FOUNDERS.
I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP.
PRIVATE EQUITY NORMALLY STAYS IN
A COMPANY FOR A FINITE AMOUNT OF
TIME IN THEM LEAVES.
WILL THAT BE DIFFERENT THIS
TIME?
>> WE SAT TOGETHER AFTER BEING
AT A BOARD MEETING TOGETHER.
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE
COLLEGE DAYS.
WE SAT TOGETHER AND REALIZED A
LOT OF WHAT WE END TALKING
ABOUT, WHICH IS THE GLOBAL
LANDSCAPE IS SO DIFFERENT THAT
WE CAN BUILD A DIFFERENT KIND OF
BUSINESS TOGETHER.
OUR FIRST CHECK IN THIS COMPANY
WAS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AS PARTNERS
ALL THE WAY LONG TO CREATE THIS.
THIS IS A COMPANY THAT WAS A
FUNCTION OF THE 40 INVEST ONCE
WE'VE MADE IN MEDIA -- INVES
TMENT WE'VE MADE IN MEDIA.
BOB PROBABLY HAS THE BEST ROI OF
ANY HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER.
HE GENERATES PROFITS.
HE HAS A RESPECT FOR CAPITAL
WHICH IS IMPORTANT AS AN
INVESTOR THAT YOU ARE WORKING
WITH SOMEONE WHO SEES THE WORLD
THAT WAY.
IT'S BEEN A GREAT MARRIAGE FROM
THE BEGINNING.
WE ULTIMATELY HAVE TO RETURN
CAPITAL TO OUR INVESTORS BUT WE
TEND TO BE FAIRLY PATIENT AND
OUR GOAL IS TO MAXIMIZE RETURN
AT THE END OF THE DAY.
>> THEY DON'T INCUBATED
COMPANIES.
THIS STARTED AS A SIMPLE IDEA
BETWEEN US AND IT HAS GROWN INTO
A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR COMPANY,
ALMOST OVERNIGHT.
WHAT'S AMAZING IS THE WEIBO AND
HIS TEAM APPROACH THE RISK
REWARD PROFILE -- WAY BOB AND
HIS TEAM APPROACH THE RISK
REWARD PROFILE AND HAVING THE
HAVE AND POWER TO ALLOW US TO
DISLOCATE A LOT OF TRADITIONAL
MAJORS IS A COMBINATION I HAVE
NOT SEEN OUT THERE.
EMILY: STX ISN'T THE ONLY
COMPANY -- YOU HAVE QUITE A
RESUME, BILL.
YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER COMPANY,
EVOLUTION MEDIA PARTNERS.
YOU ARE AN INVESTOR IN HAYBTM --
JAUNT, VIRTUAL REALITY.
WHAT  DO YOU THINK IS THE
POTENTIAL FOR VR IN MAINSTREAM
ENTERTAINMENT?
>> BOB CAN TALK ABOUT IT AS
WELL.
WE'VE MADE 4 INVESTMENTS IN ONE
OR IN -- WHAT WE THINK OF THE
MOST INTERESTING VR BUSINESSES
AND IT'S BASED ON A LOT OF WORK
THAT WE'VE DONE THEMATICALLY TO
UNDERSTAND HOW CONSUMERS ARE
ENGAGING WITH MEDIA, AND WE
BELIEVE IN SPORTS, MUSIC, AND
MEDIA CONTENT, GENERALLY GAMING
VR WILL BE A UBIQUITOUS WAY WE
ALL ENGAGE.
IT'S A MEANINGFULLY BETTER
EXPERIENCE.
EMILY: WHEN WILL I BE ABLE TO
ENJOY A VR TV OR MOVIE
EXPERIENCE COMFORTABLY?
>> BASICALLY STARTING ABOUT NOW.
AT STX, WE ARE NOT TECHNOLOGY
PEOPLE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO
WIN.
OUR GOAL IS TO AGGREGATE THE
BEST STORYTELLERS, TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE SYNTAX IS GOING TO BE
IN THIS SPACE.
WITH VR, AND VR WILL BE HUGE,
YOU DON'T CONTROL THE FRAME.
IT'S TOUGH TO TELL THE STORY AND
TAKE SOMEONE ON AN EMOTIONAL
JOURNEY WHEN YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
MANIPULATE THAT STORY FOR THEM.
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE TO
STORYTELLING.
AND, WE ARE TRYING TO THROW SOME
OF THE BEST MINDS AT THAT.
THE BIGGEST STARS, THE BEST
DIRECTORS ARE FASCINATED.
FROM OUR STANDPOINT, WE FIGURE
AS THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES ARE
VYING FOR DOMINANCE, THEY WILL
ALL NEED CONTENT, AND COMPELLING
CONTENT, AND WE WANT TO BE THE
ONE TO PROVIDE THAT VERY --
THAT.
>> THE OTHER SIDE OF IT WILL BE
EXPERIENCING LIVE EVENTS
DIFFERENTLY.
YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO
HAVE THIS AND WHAT PEOPLE SPEND
TO SIT IN THE FLOOR SEATS OF THE
WARRIOR FINAL NBA GAMES.
YOU WILL HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT
IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, IF NOT
BETTER THAN HAVING THOSE SEATS.
EMILY: DO YOU THINK THERE IS
ROOM IN THE FUTURE FOR THE
HUMBLE MOVIE THEATER?
WILL WE SILL GO -- STILL GO TO
THE CINEMA?
>> PERSONALLY, YES.
I THINK THE MOVIE THEATER ISN'T
GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.
GOING BACK TO THE CAVE MEN
SITTING AROUND TIRES TELLING
STORIES, YOU WANT THAT COMMUNAL
EXPERIENCE.
SITTING IN A DARK ROOM WITH A
BUNCH OF PEOPLE LAUGHING OR
BEING SCARED OR BEING
INTERNALIZED, -- ADRENALIZED,
THAT IS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE OF
WON'T GO ANYWHERE.
THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT TYPES OF
STORIES YOU TELL TO ACHIEVE THAT
GOAL.
BEING ABLE TO WATCH SOMETHING ON
TV IN YOUR OWN LIVING ROOM OR
EVEN ON A MOBILE PHONE, I MEAN,
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT
DEMOGRAPHICALLY AND CULTURALLY,
PEOPLE ACCESS STORIES
DIFFERENTLY.
IN CHINA, IT'S ACTUALLY VERY
NORMAL TO WATCH A 90 MINUTE
MOVIE ON YOUR PHONE.
THAT'S NOT NORMAL FOR US YET.
IT'S GOING TO ALL START TO BLEED
AND WE ARE HOPING AS IT BLEEDS,
THE DEMAND FOR QUALITY CONTENT
WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE.
EMILY: YOU ANNOUNCED CPG
ACQUIRING GRANDE COMMUNICATIONS.
HOW DO YOU SEE CONSOLIDATION
PLAYING OUT ACROSS CABLE?
>> OUR BET, IN PUTTING THE TWO
TOGETHER, RCN AND GRANDE CREATED
A TOP 10 CABLE PLATFORM.
OBVIOUSLY WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT
THE COMPANY AND THE TEAMS THERE.
WE FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT
CABLE REPRESENTS A 21ST CENTURY
UTILITY.
EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT, THE WAY PEOPLE CONSUME
CONTENT, ALL THE EXCITING NEW
DEVELOPMENTS TAKING PLACE AND
THE WAY WE ARE CONSUMING THEM,
NEED THAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE
TO ALLOW IT TO EXIST.
IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE
INSTRUCTION PUT INTO WATER
DISTRIBUTION, BASIC UTILITIES.
NOWADAYS THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL.
THESE BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO BE
DOING QUITE WELL IN OUR VIEW
GOING FORWARD, AS THEY REALIZE
THE MACRO BENEFIT DRIVING THAT
CONSUMPTION PATTERN.
EMILY: DO CONTENT CREATORS NEED
TO KEEP ONE FOOT IN DISTRIBUTION
TO MAKE THEIR MODELS WORK?
>> THAT'S OUR MODEL.
OTHER PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE.
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, WE ARE
CONVINCED THAT -- IF YOU ARE A
GREAT STORYTELLER ARE YOU HAVE A
BIG RANT -- BRAND, BEING ABLE TO
CONTROL AND BE INVOLVED WITH THE
CONTENT FROM INCEPTION ALL THE
WAY TO DELIVERY IS KEY.
YOU'RE NEVER HANDING IT OFF.
DISTRIBUTION IS ESSENTIALLY --
FROM OUR STANDPOINT, IT'S HOW
YOU CREATE ENTERPRISE VALUE.
>> STUDIO INCENTIVE -- INSTEAD
OF A PRODUCTION COMPANY.
>> NORMALLY WHEN YOU MAKE A
PIECE OF CONTENT, A TV SHOW, IT
MAKES MONEY, IT DOESN'T MAKE
MONEY, AND YOU CAPTURE THAT
MARGIN.
WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD A COMPANY
WITH ENTERPRISE VALUE, WHICH IS
VERY DIFFERENT.
>> IT HAS BEEN A GENERATION
SINCE A NEW STUDIO ON OUR SCALE
HAS BEEN CREATED.
EMILY: WE WILL GET SOME QUICK
CLOSING THOUGHTS FROM YOU AFTER
THIS BREAK.
♪
EMILY: WELCOME BACK TO
"BLOOMBERG WEST." IN OUR WEEKLY
-- "WEST" IN OUR WEEKLY
ROUNDTABLE, SERIES A.
WE WILL START WITH SPOTIFY.
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO GO
PUBLIC?
>> THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER I CAN
GIVE YOU.
THANKS FOR ASKING THAT.
EMILY: OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SO
MUCH COMPETITION WHEN IT COMES
TO MUSIC STREAMING.
APPLE IS SAYING THEY WILL
COMPLETELY REVAMP THEIR SERVICE.
HOW DO YOU SEE SPOTIFY'S PLACE
IN THIS SUPER COMPETITIVE WORLD?
>> WE ARE BIG BELIEVERS IN
SPOTIFY, EVIDENCE OUR RECENT
INVESTMENT THAT WE AND OUR CRE
DIT TEAM LED.
WE YOU THAT THERE IS A PLACE FOR
A BUSINESSLIKE SPOTIFY IN THE
FUTURE OF MUSIC.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, OVER 30
MILLION SUBSCRIBERS AT SPOTIFY
TODAY.
LAST YEAR WE STREAMED 20 BILLION
HOURS OF MUSIC.
JUST AS WE DISCUSSED HOW THE
CONSUMPTION HABIT OF MEDIA
CONTENT HAS CHANGED, MUSIC IS
SIMILAR.
MY OLDEST IS 15, AND 13, AND 11
-- THEY COULD NOT IMAGINE BUYING
MUSIC THEY STREAM EVERYTHING,
AND THAT IS THE CONSUMPTION
PATTERN THAT NOW EXIST.
THERE'S NO POINT IN STEALING
MUSIC ANYMORE, BECAUSE THEY
PROVIDE A CURATION AND MODEL OF
EXPLORING MUSIC THAT IS
DELIGHTFUL TO THE CUSTOMER.
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY ITSELF IS IN
AN INTEREST IN PLACE WHERE IT'S
BECOMING MORE COMPELLING, AND
SPOTIFY IS AND WILL BE A LEADING
PLAYER IN THAT.
EMILY: SPOTIFY ALSO GETTING INTO
VIDEO CONTENT.
>> I THINK IT ORIGINALLY STARTED
AS SPOT AND IDENTIFY, WHICH WAS
A DEAL.
I THINK THEY WENT AFTER MUSIC
FIRST BECAUSE IT WAS AN EASIER
MARKET TO CRACK.
THEY TOUCHED SO MANY PEOPLE AND
SO MANY CONSUMERS.
THERE'S A GIGANTIC OPPORTUNITY
THERE.
EMILY: LAST QUESTION ABOUT UBER,
ARE YOU GUYS INTERESTED IN
CALLING AND UBER SELF DRIVING
VOLVO SUV?
WOULD YOU GET IN THAT THING?
>> I AM A HUGE BELIEVER IN THAT
TREND.
I THINK IT'S INEVITABLE.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE IT HAPPEN
IN COMMERCIAL SHIPPING AND
TRANSPORTATION FIRST.
EMILY: WOULD YOU DO IT THIS
MONTH?
>> AS SOON AS IT'S READY, I'D
LOVE TO DO IT.
>> I'D LIKE TO TRY IT TOO.
I TOOK AN UBER FROM THE AIRPORT
TO TPG.
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE WAY THE
WORLD IS GOING TO GO.
THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT.
EMILY: THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.
I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS
DO TOGETHER.
AND, SEE "BAD MOMS."
THAT DOES IT FOR THIS EDITION OF
"BLOOMBERG WEST."
TOMORROW, DO NOT MISS OUR
CONVERSATION WITH JOHN MAEDA.
