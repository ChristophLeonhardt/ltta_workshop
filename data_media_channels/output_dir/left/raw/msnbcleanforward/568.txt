THEY DIDN’T THINK THE QUESTIONING WENT FAR OR DEEP

INCIDENT, I THINK IT DOES UNDERSCORE THE GENERAL MOOD

68
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:49,676
UNDERSCORE THE GENERAL MOOD AMONG REPUBLICANS HERE ON

69
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:50,844

76
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:02,556
AS SOON AS MONDAY OR TUESDAY, I THINK YOU’RE STARTING TO HEAR A

77
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:04,291
THINK YOU’RE STARTING TO HEAR A FEW MORE WHISPERS BEHIND THE

78
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:05,259
FEW MORE WHISPERS BEHIND THE SCENES THAT THERE ARE SOME

79
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,794
SCENES THAT THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO THINK, YOU KNOW

80
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,128
REPUBLICANS WHO THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THIS IS ACTUALLY

81
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,730
WHAT, MAYBE THIS IS ACTUALLY MOVING TOO FAST.

82
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:11,665
MOVING TOO FAST. MAYBE THERE IS MORE INFORMATION

83
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,567
MAYBE THERE IS MORE INFORMATION OUT THERE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

84
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:14,235
OUT THERE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE PROBLEMATIC FOR ALL OF US, IF

85
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,737
BE PROBLEMATIC FOR ALL OF US, IF IT COMES OUT AFTER WE HAVE GONE

86
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:17,771
IT COMES OUT AFTER WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THESE PROCESSES.

87
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:19,974
THROUGH THESE PROCESSES. AND I THINK THAT IF WE START TO

88
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,008
AND I THINK THAT IF WE START TO DISCOVER THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS

89
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,977
DISCOVER THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT ARE

90
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:24,846
THAT ARE COMING OUT ARE POTENTIALLY CREDIBLE, IF WE DO

91
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,247
POTENTIALLY CREDIBLE, IF WE DO LEARN MORE INFORMATION THAT

92
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:27,749
LEARN MORE INFORMATION THAT BACKS THEM UP, YOU COULD SEE

93
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,784
BACKS THEM UP, YOU COULD SEE SOME REPUBLICANS START TO VOICE

94
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,918
SOME REPUBLICANS START TO VOICE DOUBTS ABOUT THIS NOMINATION.

95
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,787
DOUBTS ABOUT THIS NOMINATION. AND THAT’S BEYOND THE GROUP THAT

96
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,689
AND THAT’S BEYOND THE GROUP THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT.

97
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,457
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. SENATORS COLLINS, MURKOWSKI, AND

98
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,893
SENATORS COLLINS, MURKOWSKI, AND JEFF FLAKE, AND POTENTIALLY BOB

99
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:41,262
JEFF FLAKE, AND POTENTIALLY BOB CORKER, THAT THAT GROUP COULD

100
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:41,796
CORKER, THAT THAT GROUP COULD POTENTIALLY EXPAND.

101
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,563
POTENTIALLY EXPAND. THAT’S GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY

102
00:02:42,598 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT’S GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY TRUE IF THERE IS A SENSE AT SOME
