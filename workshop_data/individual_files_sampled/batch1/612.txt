who killed Jamal keshavjee turkey says it now has evidence he was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Donald Trump says rogue killers may have done it but was it an investigation that went wrong or was a hit squad sent to silence keshavjee this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Imran Khan the joint Saudi Turkish team investigating the case of Saudi journalist Jamal keshavjee has searched the consular and now attention is turned to the consul's home the Turkish Attorney General's Office also told Al Jazeera there is evidence keshavjee was killed inside the consulate media sources in the u.s. suggests Saudi Arabia will say he died during an interrogation that went wrong King Salman said he didn't know anything about it in a phone call with President Donald Trump who then came up with his rogue killers theory US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is now in Riyadh hoping to get answers I spoke earlier to a Saudi prince prince holid bin fahan Al Saud who's living in exile I first asked him why he feels his life is under threat from the Saudi authorities in the name of Allah I am personally three years ago.i has been targeted and my life has been targeted in a rational way not the way that used with Jumeirah Shuji may Allah bestow his mercy on him I was in a state of poison and it was a sort of poison I don't know exactly what is it but after a while like one week I started to feel dizzy and I went into coma I went to the hospital and the kidney has stopped together with the liver with the full brain strokes I still at the hospital for three months they treat me with called his own I left the hospital and I stayed using the cortisone with checkups for a long time and I have been affected I put weight like 25 kilograms that system has been affected and all my organs have been affected the time of that poison left me in a state that I cannot move I cannot do anything but thank God I was in Germany medicine in Germany was okay and at the hospital doctors had to you know what is that kind of poison and I went through a surgery on my brain they opened my head and took a sample in order to know the type of the supposin that I got I said at the hospital for a long time they took the sample and it was really about to die Prince Khalid what makes you so sure that it was the Saudis behind all of this I don't know exactly what do they want I am talking the right way and if you try to be straightforward then they want to assassinate and kill you but you have any proof that it was the Saudis that came after you my brother generally I don't have enemies my friends and my relatives and my my people love me all my friends love me even my friends in the primary school are in touch with me on what's up since we were kids thank God people love me I have good contacts I have no enemies except the Saudi government because since the Salman has taken power after being in Riyadh as the governor of Riyadh for 50 years I had problem with the King Salman I had also problems with him long time ago I left Saudi Arabia and I came to Germany since 2003 but he doesn't want to leave me alone no one has an interest to kill me except King Salman in particular King Salman no one aimed at killing me except Salman bin Abdulaziz now when you were in three weeks ago you say that you were under threat that you were going to be forcibly disappeared by the Saudi or authorities this was before Jamarcus oh geez case what made you think that your life was in imminent danger I'm not going to tell the story again but I have understood that my importance comes from being a member of the royal family who criticises the family itself that's why my words affect them more and more better even than the opposition I am and I will be always their target to be assassinated by King Salman and his administration and years ago they have put me on a list of people to be assassinated I've told the police in Germany this few years ago they have tried several times to drag me into certain positions until the assassination of German forces dreaming a lobster's mess on him they told me to take money this is a cheque you can have it in Egypt and a lot of things they are trying to convince me to do but don't tell me that you you want me to be financially ok I'm living in Germany I'm not living in Saudi Arabia and they behave in a childish manner even their crimes although the ways that they are trying to drag me to to be pulled into their way is not a rational way they are childish behavior why should I got idiot to have a check why should I go there to have a check then they want me to go to Egypt and then I will be transferred into Saudi Arabia again Prince Khalid thank you very much we still don't know whether Jamarcus hog ji has been assassinated in the mt we're waiting in the consulate rather we're waiting for evidence to emerge from that but thank you very much your time let's bring in our guest joining us now from Ankara is Osman cert he is the research director at the Ankara Institute and a former adviser to Turkish Prime Minister Davutoglu in Washington DC we have John Jones he's a former u.s. senior congressional advisor and Senate national security director and finally joining us from Istanbul is someone action gate with the instable center of international law welcome to you all really there seems to be three parts currently to the keshavjee affair you have the u.s. that says it has evidence linking the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to a botched kidnapping plot you have the Turkish authorities leaking to the media that they have evidence that he was murdered inside the consulate and now you have a flurry of diplomatic activity taking place and reasons and excuses and a lot of talk within the media itself and a lot of speculation about what that diplomatic activity might be let's start with Ankara first and with Osman set Mike Pompeo Pompeyo the Secretary of State is going to Ankara what's likely behind that visit first of all mr. Pompeo wizards in Saudi Arabia because the American interests are at stake in the region because Mohammed bin Salman is most probably more important than the whole Saudi family and the Saudi Kingdom and that's why I think mr. pumpers trying to find a face-saving exit first of all Mohammed bin Salman and then for the American interests over there we have seen that what mr. Trump said drug killers it is not easy to believe in such kind of an excuse because you know this 15 man of the Saudi squad team was composed of two very close guards of Mohammed bin Salman in acetate like Saudi Arabia it is not possible to happen such kind of a to private jet planes which was being used by the kingdom can fly from Riyadh to Ankara to Istanbul and to such kind of a thing and go back without the knowledge of Mohammed bin Salman and they are trying to manage the process of course we don't know what will he will be bringing to Ankara from Saudi Arabia but what mr. Choi shall do the Turkish Foreign Minister said today is that you know there's a claim that it was happened by accident during an interrogation the Turkish Foreign Minister said that it is not a place to interrogate the Consulate's are not the are not coach and it is not a place of interrogation and the debt that's file first of all we need to see what mr. Pompey will bring in with him from Riyadh but they are trying to find a way between the realities over there which is a murder and the American interests and to keep Muhammad in Salman in the game I think would you agree with that John Jones is it about keeping Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince in the game as a guestroom Ankara just said no I think one could look at that as being part of the explanation but when you look at it the us-saudi relationship there's a relationship that goes back seven decades and is bigger than any one official leader or member of the royal family I believe mr. Pompeo is there two number one get all the answers get the understanding of what actually took place and what the Saudi authorities are going to put forth as to what exactly happened but at the end of the day is quite obvious no one is going to get to the bottom of what actually happened unless you have a true independent transparent investigation to determine how this killing took place and who's actually responsible in the end I imagine that authorities will get there it's obvious he's gonna take some time but demands are being made and demands are for transparency accountability and for the truth to come out and I think eventually that's going to happen well that's to bring in Istanbul here and so on auction gate the truth should come out the truth will come out eventually that's what our guest from Washington DC has said as an expert in international law you perhaps much much better place to tell us how difficult any investigation might be into all of this is Turkey ready and prepared to do what it needs to to get to the bottom of the keshavjee affair well the major problem and the major challenge will be the cooperation with the Saudi authorities turkey is trying to keep a balance between its obligation to not interfere the the consular relation and consular mission of the Saudi Arabia and at the same time trying to protect the human human rights and human the life of the mr. classic Jay so it is it's really hard for an receiving state a territorial state to keep a balance here well initially the Saudi Arabia after the second of October they stated that they're going to give their consent for the Turkish authorities to make a full fledge investigation well to cover up what was happened inside the consulate premises but then they try to delay the investigation and the after thovex it's only now that the Turkish authorities has been available unable to make a full-fledged investigation inside the premises and unlike the diplomatic immunities the immunity of the consular stop is functional not an absolute immunity therefore the Turkish authorities if they find enough evidence that the mr. Kashia has been abducted and executed by consular staff within the consular premises then the case might be open against the consular stuff and under the article 41 of the Vienna Convention of the consular relations 63 the Saudi consulate staff are obliged to appear before the court either as witness or as accused and then they has to and they have to provide all the informations that they have the problem with conducting such investigation and prosecution is that there are no executing power in this case if the Saudi Arabia will not waive their immunity then Turkish authorities will not be able to execute the judicial the decision of the court did you use the word you used their most challenging use the words their cover-up I want to bring in on career in Auslan search with all of this flurry of diplomatic activity with the US secretary of state visiting Riyadh visiting Ankara with the phone calls between the u.s. leader and King Salman is there evidence that Saudi Arabia is far too big to fail that the us-saudi relationship is far too crucial and therefore jamal keshavjee his case or whatever has happened to him is simply being used as a pawn to make sure that business goes on as normal I'm sir come first of all let me correct one thing mr. gentleman talking from Washington said that there is a seven decades of relations between the Saudi Arabia and the United States it's right but during the Trump eras trying to explain the American foreign policy item using decades it's a bit naive because you know maybe weeks because what is happening with North Korea what's happening with Russia watching what's happening with NATO allies it is not easy to explain the trampy era foreign policy with decades maybe weeks or maybe months at most suddenly there are Trump administration can change their policies regarding what does it mean your your question it is not easy it is not easy to just close the case and go business as usual because what's happening is a very extraordinary case happening first of all for Turkey the Turkish sovereignty is being targeted with this because the the Saudi consulate in Istanbul is in in in in Turkish soil and Turkey cannot just 1 min Salman can you stop you that let me just talk a cover is it a cover-up do you think what the US is doing and everybody all the partners involved in all the different countries involved is there potential for a cover-up or is it a cover-up look for 10 days mister the united states president waited to give a reaction to what's happened over there for probably he was already briefed about what's happening in stumble and who's mr. Kashyap his daughter is an you know an American citizen he is writing down for Washington Post articles are being published in ten days they waited when they waited for what and that's why there's at least a question mark about it but because of the you know very huge reaction against what's happening here about the diplomatic tradition about the turkeys sovereignty and that's why it won't be easy to cover it and Jon Jones you're shaking your head best you're shaking your head no Jon Jones what do you think of what our guest in on Chris saying oh no the gentleman from Ankara makes a very interesting argument though I would disagree with him well in saying that you only could look at this in the situation and within the matter of the last few days or years of the Trump administration it's important to very it's important to look at the genesis of the relationship as it pertains to this particular situation and if you look at the us-saudi relationship or larger or their large relationship in the Middle East there is easy to develop an obsession with President Trump in his actions but you also have to look at historical actions Congress has taken steps to act no matter what a commander-in-chief or president has chosen to do as it pertains to a situation like this if you look at the situation in terms of apartheid South Africa it was Congress who acted outside of the wishes of Ronald Reagan to implement sanctions on the South African government if you look at what Congress did in relationship to the development of Iran's nuclear program it was Congress who implemented sanctions despite what President Obama wanted or did not want to do and no matter what President Trump or his administration decides to do in this event Congress is going to act both Republicans and Democrats have already said that so I think if you look at the situation of Ford there was going to be pressure on the Saudi government and with that pressure I do believe there will be concessions will they be immediate no should they be immediate absolutely this is a tragedy which is taking place a tragic killing took place within a consulate this is awful and I do think at the end of the day you will have forces and powers of outside of the president and the administration will be demanding accountability and information john engines i'm just gonna stay with you for a second let's talk about the wild card in the room here if the Saudis come out and say this was rogue intelligence agents that botched an operation that these royal family that the leadership simply didn't know about is that going to be acceptable to somebody like the Washington Post who have put almost all of their resources into covering the disappearance of their own journalists will they believe something like that and will they continue to put pressure on domestic American politicians to get to the truth of the matter I think at the end of the day just won't be American politicians who will be encouraged to act quite frankly a number of them don't need the motivation there are people within the Congress in the Senate who are outraged by what I've taken place and they've been very vocal about that but more than that I would imagine that you also have politicians within the European Union who will be demanding action and demanding a response that is proportional to what actually has taken place here so I don't think it just falls on the American government though there's a responsibility that must be put forward it also is incumbent on many countries within the European Union and the international community to really step up and call for accountability and to punish those persons who are took place in this tragic killing someone let me bring you in here what we're saying is a situation developed plenty of diplomatic activity as we've already said but if a narrative developing that the Saudis may well blame rogue intelligence elements the Turks are going to have to go along with that as well as the US if that becomes the narrative that the Saudis want to put out there is it there for a cover-up or is it there for sorwe of all parties saving face and being able to go about businesses noble well given this given the given the circumstances and the nature of the crime that has happened it is really hard for us to claim whether there is a cover-up in this situation or the the parties are seeking an accountability genuinely but the thing is that if if the artists or find enough ground to agree on and seek accountability that it would be best for all the parties to waive the immunity of the consular stuff and then the Turkish authorities would be able to exercise their jurisdiction for the perpetrators who commit those crimes and alternatively the Saudi Arabia can also repatriate its consular stuff and prosecute them in their domestic courts but in either way either the Turkish authorities prosecute them or they go without any proper jurisdiction the consular staff who will try to return their work back will not be practically able to engage in an effective diplomacy with Turkish authorities given the circumstances of this situation we are coming towards the end of the show I would like to ask each of you a quick question you have 30 seconds to answer each of you the question is very simple I'll start with Ankara first what needs to come out in order for the world to draw a line under this affair both diplomatically and with the truth being at the center of it what needs to come out what would you like to see just a very quick answer it's very open that you know the it is a diplomatic mission and the country who is owning the diplomatic mission is the responsible for what has happened the Saudis are telling that they are admitting or confirming the merger over that they cannot the murderer cannot confirm it they can confess it what happened first of all the 15 guards whether they are responsible owners should be decided and the very important point is who is behind this order to kill mr. Kashyap she should be find out this is very important to you Jon Jones emotion do you see what would you like to say what would you like to see come out what's credible enough for you you need a trick well you need a transparent independent credible investigation into exactly what happened and who's responsible it's obvious that the Saudis cannot investigate themselves so you do need a coalition to participate in in a transparent investigation to get to the bottom of what actually happened and just a one quick point guarding the road killer statement I think because that was leaked out that was something that was probably tested by the Saudis and you can just tell by the response of the domestic and international community that explanation is probably not going to work so I think the Saudis will be left with no choice but in the end to allow an investigation that is outside of their control to happen to get to the bottom or what actually took place to someone in Istanbul very quickly what can international law do to get a credible answer to the keshavjee otha just very quickly what the problem yeah the problem with so many people are receiving diplomatic and consular privileges and immunities and there is a likelihood that a lot of people are have the opportunity to abuse their privileges and immunities and so the international community should rethink and rethink about changing the convention in the way that the sending state should not have the full authority to either give the consent for an genuine investigation or not so there would be enough if there will be enough basis to make this change maybe the international community should change the way of protecting the diplomatic and consular stuff and providing more accountability for the victims to all our guests I want to thank you osmond cert John H Jones and so man action gay thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website al Jazeera comm and for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is aj inside story at aj inside story from me Imran Khan and the whole team here bye for now
