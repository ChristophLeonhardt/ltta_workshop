1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,049
It’s the late ’90s. You make
some dumb choices.

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,810
You get charged with
robbing a Subway.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,690
You spend four years
in prison.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,320
It’s 1995.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,140
Your friends rob a KFC.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,520
You drive the getaway car.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,100
Four years in jail.

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,230
That was then.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,040
Now you’re a pastor
at a church.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,880
Today, you run a successful
flooring business.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,360
You’ve paid your dues.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,890
You’ve made amends.

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,660
Now you want to have
a voice in the world.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,870
But, you live in Florida.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,390
The Sunshine State is
one of only four states

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,140
that permanently bars felons
from casting a ballot.

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,000
And there are 1.7 estimated 
million people there

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,610
who are disenfranchised 
due to a prior felony conviction.

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,280
Over 10% of adults
in the state cannot vote.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,890
Nearly one in
four black adults

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,350
is disenfranchised.

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,060
The law does provide one
way for former felons

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,680
to get their
voting rights back.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,620
But don’t get your hopes up.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,190
Then you have to wait
another 10, 12 years.

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,630
Why? Because there is a
backlog of about 10,000 cases.

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,640
Finally, as many as 20 years
later, you get your big day in court.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,930
If your hearing was in front
of Governor Rick Scott,

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,300
you amost certainly 
heard this:

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,510
I deny restoration 
of civil rights.

31
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,490
I deny restoration 
of civil rights.

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,345
At this point, I'm going to deny
restoration of civil rights.

33
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:42,590
I deny restoration
of civil rights.

34
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,900
I deny restoration
of civil rights.

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,880
So it’s all denied.

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,430
Well, first off, thanks for your 
work for the state.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,210
Thank you.

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,350
At this point, I don’t 
feel comfortable

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,355
giving your restoration of civil rights.

40
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,665
But congratulations on your work,

41
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:55,730
and congratulations on your daughter.

42
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,457
Thank you.

43
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:58,890
The law gives the governor
and his cabinet members

44
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,362
the power to decide our fate.

45
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:01,820
And there’s no
rules or guidelines.

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,650
There is no right to clemency.

47
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,770
There’s no standards.

48
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,690
The governor goes first.

49
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,780
If I deny, then it’s over.

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,888
The governor can
turn you away for any reason

51
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,210
no matter how petty.

52
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,340
Just don’t get traffic
tickets all the time.

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,800
I mean, I mean it
just says something.

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,110
It says you
don’t care about the law.

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,130
And it’s not just me.

56
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,660
Governor Scott has denied 
way more people

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,830
than his predecessors.

58
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,890
In the last eight years,

59
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,170
the number of disenfranchised
citizens in Florida

60
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,510
has increased by
nearly 200,000 people.

61
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,500
But wait, how did
we even get here?

62
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
The law is 150
years old and was

63
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,010
designed to keep people that
looked like me from voting.

64
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,750
When the Civil War ended,

65
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,070
freed slaves represented almost
half of Florida’s population.

66
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,090
The state’s all-white lawmakers
came up with a racist plan

67
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,760
to prevent blacks
from gaining power.

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,800
They created Black Codes,

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,250
not-so-subtly named 
laws that subjected

70
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,270
black people to harsh
sentences for minor offenses.

71
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,800
They then barred anyone with
a conviction from voting.

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,270
They didn’t even try 
to hide it.

73
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,610
For the next 150 years,

74
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,780
no one questioned the law.

75
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,210
And now, here we are.

76
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,500
Florida voters will get to
decide on a ballot referendum

77
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,960
that would restore
voting rights to felons

78
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,040
who have done their time.

79
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,680
Murderers and sex
offenders are excluded.

80
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,350
To pass Amendment 4,

81
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,280
voters would need 60% 
or more in November.

82
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,450
Vote “Yes” in November to
restore voting rights.

83
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,250
Be our voice today

84
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,370
so everyone invested in
the future of Florida

85
00:03:51,370 --> 00:00:00,000
can help shape that future.
