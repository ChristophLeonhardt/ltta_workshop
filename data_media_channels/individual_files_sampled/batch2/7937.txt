Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore was an embarrassment for the GOP since he won the primary somewhat surprisingly and all of that was before it was revealed that he apparently had a number of relationships with underaged girls back in the late 70s and early 80s and that has caused a number of prominent Republicans to denounce more or sort of denounce him while leaving a lot of wiggle room or quickly walk away from the person asking the question so that you add all that up and it's a bad situation for the GOP but we want to give you the details of what was revealed by the Washington Post today so it turns out that back when he was a judge there was a 14 year old girl Leigh Kaufman that was sitting outside of her mother outside of a courthouse because a custody hearing was going on which is great context for this he approaches the mom and the daughter and says that the mom can go inside to deal with the legal stuff and he will stay outside with the child it was very nice of him unfortunately an ulterior motive alone with lame or chatted her up and asked for her phone number days later he picked her up around the corner from her house drove her around 30 I noticed that she was around the corner from her house not at her house that's interesting that that's how we set that up I drove her about thirty minutes to his home in the woods told her how pretty she was and kissed her on a second visit she says he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes he touched her over her bra and Underpants she says and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear as she was quoted by the Washington Post as saying I wanted it over with I wanted out please just get this over with whatever this is just get it over and so she asked to be taken home and he took her home at that point now two of her childhood friends say that she told them back at the time that she was seeing older man one says that at the time she identified him as more so this is not you know just looking back 30-plus years she had been talking to people about this including to her mother inside of ten years of it happening now there are three other women interviewed by the post that say that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 Wendy Miller says she was 14 and working as a Santa's helper at a mall that's just terrible when Moore first approached her but thankfully he waited two years before he started asking her out on dates and there was another 17 year old they spoke to in her high school so he knew exactly how old she was because she was still in high school at that point understand that he was in his 30s when all of these situations were going on now with those two women apparently didn't go beyond kissing but there was an 18 year old cheerleader that says that Moore took her out on dates that included bottles of wine when she was not of legal age to drink the wine and so this adds up to a problem for him because their appearantly is a pattern of behavior where he was targeting women as young as 14 for dates at cruising malls or the high schools malls and high schools looking for people working with Santa's that's a pretty dark situation now he did respond his campaign responds saying these allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign now I don't know about all of the women but Curfman the the fourteen-year-old the story says that she has voted for the Republican in the last three presidential elections she voted for Donald Trump and apparently none of the women have been involved in any way in terms of donations or anything with this race and so the idea that they are just hacks trying to help the campaign is not just offensive in the normal way that these sorts of allegations are but it's also unfounded in any way she's a Donald Trump supporter that he apparently tried to seduce while she was 14 years old weird how sexual we've done a lot lately about harasses abusers in this case potential pedophiles they don't really fall within one party or another and their victims don't always fall within one part another I'm sure when he was cruising the malls in the high schools back in the 70s he wasn't going cause this person to be a future Republican before I harassed and he tried to seduce her and and I mean there was the ATO the game - I'm not sure with that went to every one of his targets but so it's a shame that you even have to say a so just to point out you guys this victim of this pedophile this potential pedophile voted for Trump didn't care about all the things that was coming out about him during the election has voted for Republicans in the past so that so that the attack on her won't be oh look at this just just a lying dim that's all they're ever doing try to get us and take us down yeah it happens - from people of any political stripe and of people that alien yeah and that way officer that was to refute his general argument which was that it's politically motivated and of course he kept just throwing that up it's Bolivia monitor pollute they motivated and that's going to be the size that fits all on this issue it's interesting also to see some in the GOP pulling away from him but some defending him and I was seeing something from the state auditor there and quoting Bible and saying that you know even with Joseph and Mary Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult I'm thinking that wow I mean that's a tortured kind of defense for this I mean we never know that is stupid as an example that is that is we mean I don't know a lot about the Bible but they didn't even sleep together that's like that was the whole point to that story you moron do it again the Atheist has to remind the Christian of how this thing plays out yeah but it's disgusting I love that like he's like Roy Moore is like today spotlight in the news perverted Alabama politician and this say daughter is like hold my beer and beat him exactly no it's a look there's no there's no defense this this may stick particularly when you see so many of the GOP melting away from him right now yeah yeah so we actually have a little bit of that here in this compilation that gerra put together you're gonna see Richard Shelby and Jeff Flake responding to questions about these new allegations if there is any shred of truth step aside now is he but would he be fit to serve in the Senate of history no no if there's any shred of truth the other step aside I mean just with regard to Roy Moore those stories are all just okay it's a devastating nasty story if the revelations is that's true I don't believe they'd be any place for him in the US Senate okay so in addition to them you also have Mitch McConnell calling him to step down if it's true so again leaving themselves some wiggle room there but John McCain said the allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying he should immediately step down and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of so John McCain perhaps the least sort of hedging his bet set of yeah you know the this kind of Vince to what I was thinking when I saw the immediate refusal or a rebuttal of him which doesn't happen like what's why I was a little bit surprising to Richard Shelby after he said the first parts of there a follow-up question said so do you think do you think he should carry on and maybe go on and serve if he wins and he said well you know who I support in the primary it wasn't this guy and he Luther strange sure um so the point being they did the guys that that didn't want him because of his other political innings they know how much of how many racist things he said he backed the whole birtherism thing and his homophobia behavior so all that they already know about know how hard is gonna be to have this guy around he's crazy yeah so they're like okay let's hurry up and say well let's get him up for this reason because we didn't want for the other reasons we'd have to defend them for yeah that worked particularly illegal just deplorable yeah yeah although and again it's good to see them actually coming out against him for the most part again I'm gonna have one or two they're pretty bad of people defending him but they are coming out against him but in the wake of Access Hollywood tape some prominent Republicans denounced Trump and now enthusiastically work to advance his agenda every single day so these sorts of denunciations only go so far it is weird by the way Johnny that politics is that one space that's sort of you don't know which way it's going to fall I mean you know show business everybody's pulling movies and reshooting films and guys are losing their jobs and are closing down studios and declaring bankruptcy at the first whiff of sexual harassment and certainly these rape allegations as well but here as you mentioned the excess Hollywood tape we end up with the president of United States yeah you know it just you're not sure how much will stick I think jr. makes a great point when he talks about the fact that it may be the extremism here and Roy Moore that will that is he hasn't made a lot of friends along the way they may hurt him also yeah maybe and I noticed one of the first things that came out about this I think they actually tried to beat the Washington Post to publishing this somebody tipped them off but Breitbart put an article as a part of several articles about that this is a hit job basically and they defended his relationships with most of the women saying he's just being romantic and stuff like that it's there's nothing immoral about you know habitually trying to date people who are 47% as old as you now they do the percentage I'm probably wrong and then they got to the section with the fourteen-year-old and they didn't even comment on that they just linked to the post section on it and then moved on to other stuff and so a fourteen-year-old is in defense room it's indefensible and so this is the outlet that pushed the pizza gate conspiracy amongst others was so concerned about pedophilia in Washington now working getting out as fast as they can to run interference for a guy who apparently was a serial pedophile back in the SEPA so the reason that they think this is all politically motivated is because this is a card that they play a lot yes let's just go ahead and and bash anyone by any way we can something is completely embarrassing or even something that most people actually accept or other people have done in normal relationships a chance but let's just put that stuff out there and maybe destroy them so when it's something is actually really bad they said on how to destroy me everybody thought to get me no one has been treated I think this was this particular one no one has been treated as badly as Roy Moore has no flipmode politician in history except your boy the president has the same thing already exactly yeah at some point there's only one who's treated worse than ever else if you like this clip of The Young Turks
