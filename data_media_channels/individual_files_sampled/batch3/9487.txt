BUCKET OF CHICKEN MANURE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BUILDING. HE WAS PROMPTLY ARRESTED. Bret: DOUG McKELWAY IN LEXINGTON VIRGINIA. THANKS. THE PRESIDENT IS ANOINTING MAXINE WATERS AS THE FACE OF THE DEMOCRATS AND MANY OF HER DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ARE CRITICAL OF HER COMMENTS AS WELL. AND YET SEVERAL PROMINENT LIBERAL COMMENTATORS BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH HARASSING POLITICAL OPPONENTS. TONIGHT FOX NEWS MEDIA AND HOST OF FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ HOWARD KURTZ PUT THIS SITUATION VIRGINIA RESTAURANT HAD REFUSED TO SERVE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, SOME PUNDITS, THOSE WHO DETEST PRESIDENT TRUMP, STARTED CHEERING. THE PRESS SECRETARY THEY SAID DESERVES THE RUDE TREATMENT. YOU MAKE CHOICES IN LIFE AND THERE IS A COST TO BEING AN ACCOMPLICE TO THIS CRUEL, DECEITFUL ADMINISTRATION. THE DEFINING FEATURE OF A FREE SOCIETY IS THAT YOU CAN TELL ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR JENNIFER RUBIN SAYS TRUMP OFFICIALS COULD BE, SOCIAL PROPRIETORS OF SORTS. MOST CONSERVATIVES AREN'T DENOUNCED THE END ACCIDENT AND PROTESTS CONFRONTING OUR TRUMP AIDS ESPECIALLY AFTER DEMOCRATIC HARASSMENT. SHOUTING EACH OTHER DOWN, KICKING OUR POLITICAL ENEMIES OUT OF RESTAURANTS, HECKLING THEM IN PUBLIC MAY FEEL GOOD IN THE MOMENT, BUT IT ISN'T A SOLUTION. THREATENING WOMEN AND CHILDREN, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE ON THE LEFT? DAVID AXELROD GROUP DRC DAVID AXELROD GROUP DRI DAVID AXELROD GROUP DRM FROM DEMOCRATS FOR TAKING SANDERS SIDE. WRITING KIND OF AMAZED AND APPALLED BY THE NUMBER OF FOLKS IN THE LEFT TO ASK APPLAUDED THE RESTAURANT. TRUMP OPPONENTS ARE USING THE PRESIDENT'S PREVIOUS POLICY OF FAMILY SEPARATION AT THE BORDER TO JUSTIFY THEIR IN-YOUR-FACE TACTIC. THESE CLIPS FROM MSNBC'S MORNING JOE. IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY GETTING READY TO THROW TOMATO, KNOCK THE I WOULD LIKE TO PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE, SERIOUSLY. OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN SIMILAR FASHION. IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE BOTH MAGNIFIED BY A POLARIZED MEDIA ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL MEDIA.
