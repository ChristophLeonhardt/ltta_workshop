I'm in st. Petersburg Stadium and I have
to say looking up it looks fabulous
everyone watching football in here will
have a great view but then I look down
and there's no pitch but don't worry
that's because this is a smart stadium
they roll the pitch out and when they
need it they roll back in and here is
the pitch just lay in there being proved
and the way they roll it back in is the
purchased normal wheels it looks
absolutely spectacular
it takes about 90 minutes each way at
the moment the pitch is in the sunshine
getting ready to be perfect for the
seven games that are being played here
and I think the pick of the bunch there
must be that Costa Rica gets another
shot at Brazil in a World Cup I've been
told that st. Petersburg is a fantastic
City
I'm Peter Schmeichel and I'm so eager to
find out is that to choose
when I started to travel around to the
11 host cities everyone said to me once
you get to st. Petersburg you will see
something truly amazing I my first stop
the peterhof palace where the stars used
to come every summer it's a summer
residence and it's beautiful
and I got the privilege to turn the
stanton on I think it looks pretty
pretty good with the water coming out of
it and also I think I did a pretty good
job
first they live the top life I could
tell you that danton's statues
it's so extravagant all the gold all the
glitter that looks precisely like the
hotel in Sochi where Brazil is staying
when they come to st. Petersburg to
plays in Costa Rica if they see this
they must feel right at home
I'm enjoying my time as a tourist the
grounds here are impressive I have to
say it's well worth a visit
one of my favorite musical pieces is
acknowledge of Second Piano Concerto the
chairman of the Batman enough foundation
is a big football fan it happens to be
one of the FIFA ambassadors for the
World Cup on top of being one of the
best pianists in the world and would you
believe it he's here in st. Petersburg
so I've decided to go and say hello to
see you play piano - I know it's like
this from the broken football so when I
was young I played in football - it was
crazy about that and I broke my hands
three times and how does that work with
a much faster play something place all
right no no please don't
yeah
Second Piano Concerto soloist better
action unbelievable
ro
that's all right you play that for me
this is my favorite piece you're playing
in the world when it's your mom
okay okay
listen to you I wanna we need takes how
many years to play this 20 totally I
play 30 panic rhetoric - more than 300
times not a lot of penis would take that
on because that's very difficult
yeah somebody counted more than 55,000
notes the way you play you're very very
aggressive and this is what I really
like I mean I've listened to Japanese
pianists are very soft and it doesn't
come out the same way it's not
aggressive this is passion whenever
there are - number three
it doesn't work without purse no
footballs your passion is well
absolutely I play football for my
childhood we have a lot of the same
things for example conductor Orchestra
the chief coach blares the orchestra
player some together the most important
Boyle is a play for the audience yeah
this is the most important thing can I
just put you in context there so who are
you you'd be someone like Messi over and
out maybe Maradona oh yeah yeah yeah you
also play chess

to hear you play chess
