1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,540
so our first question is why why is AOL

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,760
having its layoffs<font color="#E5E5E5"> dragged on and on and</font>

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,859
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real reason is there's two</font>

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,420
separate layoffs going on here back in

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,730
December there was the voluntary buyouts

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">AOL said then that it needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut its</font>

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,539
workforce by about a third<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's about</font>

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,449
2,500 employees so it told its employees

9
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,369
hey if you want to lay off yourself

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,050
here's a package it's a little bit more

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,460
generous than what will offer if we

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,940
involuntarily fire you so only 1,100

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,590
employees took them like took the

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,230
voluntary buyout and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,690
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1400 still need to be fired that's</font>

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,300
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down this week and again</font>

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,770
they're dragging on a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">because a will fire some people on</font>

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monday it's letting more people know</font>

20
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,110
today and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the people it'll</font>

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,180
fire tomorrow you know that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,070
bit damaging to drag<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,329
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine why they wouldn't have</font>
