1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,930
so Tom let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a war of the</font>

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,779
elephants you've got Microsoft Google

3
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:09,589
and Apple increasingly going after this

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,200
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile and search and</font>

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,400
everything else they're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,110
beating each other's brains out

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">head-to-head what happens to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that over</font>

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,369
the next five to ten I'd add facebook I

9
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:22,099
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook is a big enough player</font>

10
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,230
obviously a fraction of the market cap

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,029
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other three but but I think</font>

12
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:29,480
they're their major factor as well what

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,210
happens you know the big play<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,940
forward first of all you know winning

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,219
the hearts and minds of commercially

16
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,920
intended consumers is where the action

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,570
is in terms of business right people

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,190
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose sight of that right it's</font>

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's not necessarily where people go</font>

20
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,629
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they go to think about cleans</font>

21
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:50,360
commercial or advertising through

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,430
whatever right whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean making</font>

23
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,379
decisions about what to buy right that's

24
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:55,879
why search has been such a juggernaut

25
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,309
because it's been the place they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

26
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:00,590
lots of things but overwhelmingly it's

27
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,629
the place<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go to figure out what</font>

28
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,690
to buy and that's where google has made

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey so what happens going forward first</font>

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,440
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the two arenas in the web and</font>

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,330
I would extend this to other media as

32
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">well but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the web is it still going to</font>

33
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,010
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> search and Google thinks about having</font>

34
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,270
come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> google in last three years</font>

35
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">google thinks about two places</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

37
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start going to their friends to think</font>

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,840
about commercial decisions rather than

39
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,340
this this utility<font color="#CCCCCC"> of search and their</font>

40
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook obviously is a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat and</font>

41
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,340
second are they going to skip past the

42
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,610
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of generic search mode and go</font>

43
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,410
specifically to commercially oriented

44
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,210
searches to a commercially oriented

45
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,820
ecommerce search site like Amazon right

46
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,410
so the two big<font color="#E5E5E5"> players winning a man</font>

47
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,330
named amazon we should have two big

48
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,280
players that are threatening in in terms

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google's current business not</font>

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,620
Microsoft Yahoo they are Facebook and

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,520
Amazon so you say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,580
Facebook as of yet has barely figured

53
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,470
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> indicated they're just starting to</font>

54
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,030
people have always been saying this

55
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,800
but you've got another longtime internet

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,720
better veteran bopi buddy who founded

<font color="#CCCCCC">come at basically state look this whole</font>

59
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea that Facebook and Twitter are going</font>

60
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,440
to be good businesses to joke never

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to happen you seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

62
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,240
differently you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the issue facebook</font>

63
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,640
is taking a page from from Google's book

64
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,230
and saying let's just keep developing

65
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,700
the platform they put ninety-eight

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,410
percent of their energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that and by</font>

67
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not wrong to do it</font>

68
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,739
facebook is running at whatever we hear

69
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,440
a billion dollar revenue run rate on 400

70
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,330
million uniques that's too low at fifty

71
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,430
cents a year that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> minuscule right they</font>

72
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,760
could be generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1020 hundred times</font>

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
that business<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 is a little little</font>

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">high but they could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generated a lot</font>

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
more business right they don't do it

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,950
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're intent on building and</font>

77
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,250
maintaining that that platform the place

78
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">people go to to connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

79
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,130
to share information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and entertainment</font>

80
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,100
so so they're focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that they're</font>

81
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really focused on monetizing what</font>

82
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,730
they do in terms of selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

83
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,319
low-hanging fruit that basically selling

84
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,239
TV they're selling mass with a

85
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,430
demographic overlay they could do so

86
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,230
much more they could do what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do at me</font>

87
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">t</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 degrees they could use friend</font>

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,010
targeting and they could do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> at great</font>

89
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,500
scale but they choose not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I frankly</font>

90
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to encourage them to do it because</font>

91
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">it wouldn't help you improve my business</font>

92
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,720
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did but they choose not to they</font>

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,340
choose to focus on the platform and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

94
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">low-hanging fruit in terms of Commerce</font>

95
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,420
nevertheless they are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

96
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,079
down the line because because that's a

97
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">viable option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for consumers in terms of</font>

98
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,870
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what to buy going to</font>

99
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,489
friends as we do in real life we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask our</font>

100
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,380
friends right<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so here's the</font>

101
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,209
fearless prediction part now so we look

102
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,590
at the market caps of all these

103
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,060
companies right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> on sort of a bar</font>

104
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,180
graph you've got Microsoft Apple Google

105
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,670
hanging out up here somewhere Facebook's

106
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,560
way down here is in lost revenue Twitter

107
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,720

109
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">years what do they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like Microsoft</font>

110
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,870
going down Microsoft's going down I mean

111
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,239
there's no all the growth arenas are

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,089
places where Microsoft has already lost

113
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make something out of</font>

114
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,970

they've got negative your chart the

118
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,470
other day was fabulous that gun they you

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just they're they're in</font>

120
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,400
decline in the key new platform which is

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,340
mobile so I Microsoft's got nowhere to

122
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,530
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge cache credibly</font>

job with<font color="#E5E5E5"> search they could do better</font>

133
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,090
they are they have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> game to lose in</font>

134
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,910
my and mobile right<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

135
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,340
be a great commercial platform in that

136
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,090
search mode it's a small footprints hard

137
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,590
to do other kinds of advertising but you

138
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,630
can find stuff there and you can find

139
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,729
stuff commercially there and Google with

140
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:25,610
with between search and Google geo maps

141
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,430
etc they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the big player mode</font>

142
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,680
and that leads us to Apple which is also

143
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,169
an apple becoming a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> play right and</font>

144
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have the platform and then and the</font>

145
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:37,460
walled garden platform and they'd like

146
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to extend that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I i don't i think</font>

147
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,360
that's that's a strategy there's their

148
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,830
wall garden strategy I think has

149
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,720
diminishing returns so I think Google

150
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,520
will beat them in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile so you think</font>

151
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Apple's making the same mistake</font>

152
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,300
made with Microsoft with a mac by the

153
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,590
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hay with it they made a</font>

154
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,919
lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've generated a lot of</font>

155
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,780
enterprise value with that model and

156
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,820
maybe they can find the next one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

157
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,280
keep keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know leapfrogging and</font>

158
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,560
maybe in the iPads it i don't know but

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,710
but in fact in in the in the smartphone

160
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,409
arena i think google<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

161
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:13,940
ascendant I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> apples going to</font>

162
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,659
plateau so certainly a contrarian view

163
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,190
there it sounds like the most contrarian

164
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,900
view maybe your view of facebook which

165
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,940
is that they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact kick into a</font>

166
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,949
high gear I think they doubt I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

167
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,120
it's going to take them a couple years

168
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,009
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think commercially they can do it</font>

169
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,659
on the web they can do it mobile and

170
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,090
they can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very valuable platform in</font>

171
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,310
both and then lastly little<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

172
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,750
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still making a lot of noise</font>

173
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,700
uncle buzz going to kill them<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

174
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,169
gonna kill

175
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,479
any business there is it just Twitter I

176
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
think they talk comfortably about what's

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,860
coming I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious to see what it</font>

178
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">is I dick castle as a personal friend of</font>

179
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,689
mine I like him a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I you know I</font>

180
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:50,830
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll come up with something I</font>

181
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what's going to be they've</font>

182
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,979
got a they've got a they've got a great

183
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,629
plot they again are taking that page

184
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,669
from google and now facebook and just

185
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,110
building the platform am not worrying

186
00:06:59,110 --> 00:00:00,000
too much about the commercial
