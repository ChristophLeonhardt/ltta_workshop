THE SPANISH REGION OF
CATALONIA HELD A REFERENDUM
RECENTLY, OVER THE PAST WEEKEND
AND THE REFERENDUM OF COURSE HAS
TO DO WITH THE IDEA OF
SEPARATING FROM SPAIN AND
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF
MADRID.
BEFORE I GIVE THE DETAILS ON HOW
THAT REFERENDUM WENT AND THEN
SAY NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE
INJURED DUE TO POLICE BRUTALITY,
I WANT TO SHARE THE MOST RECENT
UPDATE WHICH INVOLVES THE
KING OF SPAIN AND A VERY RARE
SPEECH THAT HE GAVE TODAY WHICH
WAS RATHER FORCEFUL IN REGARD TO
BEING AGAINST THE SEPARATISTS
AND MAKING STATEMENTS CALLING
FOR UNITY 
IN SPAIN.
HE ALSO SAID:
QUICKLY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
ECONOMIC ISSUES AT PLAY HERE.
IF CATALONIA WERE TO SEPARATE
FROM SPAIN, SPAIN WOULD LOSE
20% OF ITS ECONOMY.
SOME OF ITS MOST WEALTHY PEOPLE
LIVING CATALONIA.
THERE IS AN INCOME OR WEALTH
WRISTER REDISTRIBUTION ISSUE
THERE WERE THESE WEALTHY EARNERS
OBVIOUSLY PAY MORE IN TAXES.
THOSE TAXES ARE REDISTRIBUTED TO
THE POOR COMMUNITIES AMONGST THE
SPANISH AND ANOTHER THING TO
KEEP IN MIND IS THAT CATALONIA
ACTUALLY OWNS A HUGE PORTION OF
THE PUBLIC DEBT AND ONE
PROBLEM IS THAT THEY SEPARATE,
THEY WOULDN'T BE ALL
BEGINNING TO PAY THAT DEBT TO
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES
AT PLAY HERE.
I WANT 
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
SOMETHING.
ALTHOUGH THE DAY THAT THEY
VOTED, UNFORTUNATELY ENDED
IN TURMOIL AND VIOLENCE MAINLY
BECAUSE OF THE POLICE
RESPONSE TO THOSE PROTESTERS,
TODAY WAS LARGELY PEACEFUL.
IS SEEMS MORE AS A CELEBRATORY
DAY AS OPPOSED TO A DAY MET WITH
VIOLENCE SO HERE IS SOME VIDEO
KIND OF SHOWING YOU WHAT IT
LOOKED LIKE AND THESE ARE
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AGAIN,
CALLING FOR THE SEPARATION OF
CATALONIA FROM SPAIN.
THE PEOPLE OF CATALONIA AND
PROTESTERS OR VOTERS WERE
NEVER VIOLENT.
IT WAS THE COPS
WHO WERE VIOLENT AND OFTEN,
THE STATE STRUT THE WORLD WILL
DO THIS.
THEY WILL SAY, WE ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE.
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS VIOLENT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
LOOK, THE COURT IN SPAIN SAID
THAT THIS BUT WAS NOT LEGAL.
I AM NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERT
IN FATE SPAIN, SO I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT IS TRUE OR UNTRUE, IF
THAT WAS A CORRECT RULING OR NOT
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE
GOVERNMENT'S REACTION WAS
DISASTROUS SO IF THE VOTE IS NOT
LEGAL ANYWAY AND THE COURT
SEVERAL THAT IT IS NOT VALID,
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO IN
THERE WITH BATONS AND SHOOTING
RUBBER BULLETS AT PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO VOTE AND
GRABBING THEM BY THE HAIR
AND DRAGGING THEM OUT OF THE
VOTING BOOTH .RU INSANE?
WHAT A TERRIBLE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE RESPONSE.
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
YOUNG, HEALTHY PEOPLE THAT
WERE MET WITH VIOLENCE.
THERE WAS FOOTAGE SHOWING
ELDERLY PEOPLE BEING DRAGGED OUT
OF THE VOTING BOOTH AND THAT
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR WHICH WAS
UNCALLED FOR AND THERE WERE EVEN
SOME OF THE SEPARATIST LEADERS
WHO ADMITTED TO THE PRESS THAT
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A NONBINDING
VOTE CONSIDERING HOW THE COURTS
HAVE REACTED TO IT BUT THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN
REALLY REACTED AGGRESSIVELY
TO THIS REFERENDUM.
GOING BACK TO THE REFERENDUM,
WHAT HAPPENED?
ABOUT 42% OF VOTERS SHOWED UP TO
THE POLLS WERE PART OF THE
REASON WHY VOTER TURNOUT WAS
SO LOW WAS BECAUSE OF THE
INTIMIDATION TACTICS BY SPAIN'S
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.
BECAUSE OF THE POLICE VIOLENCE
AROUND ALMOST 900 PEOPLE WERE
INJURED AND THAT IS ACCORDING TO
CATTLE ON OFFICIALS.
IF YOU WANTED TO BE THE POINT
MAKE THE POINT, DON'T WORRY,
SPAIN IS A DEMOCRACY IN YOUR FOR
FULL FREEDOM OF YOUR RIGHT START
YOU PICKED A CURIOUS WAY TO DO
IT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BOW?
BY THE DOORS, RIP OF THE
BALLOTS, BEAT THE PEOPLE UP
YOU ARE TRYING TO VOTE.
THAT IS NOT A WINNING STRATEGY
TO WIN HEARTS AND MINDS.
ESPECIALLY IF YOU CLAIM TO
VALUE DEMOCRACY BECAUSE
THAT MEANS THAT ANYONE YOU
DISAGREE WITH, YOU WILL
MEET THEM WITH VIOLENCE.
THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY.
SO LOOK, IS A VERY HARD ISSUE
AND IT IS AN ISSUE THAT A
LOT OF COUNTRY STRUGGLE WITH.
IN THE CASE OF SPAIN, THEY 17
DIFFERENT REGIONS.
THEY ALL BREAK UP, IF CATALONIA
GOES, GOD KNOWS WHO GOES NEXT.
THE UK HAS TO DEAL WITH THIS WAS
SCOTLAND FROM TIME TO TIME.
THERE ARE PLENTY OF COUNTRIES
WITH POLICE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS.
IT'S AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO GRAPPLE
WITH IS THE WORLD AND THERE
ARE NO EASY ANSWERS BUT I KNOW
WHAT THE ANSWER ISN'T WHICH
IS VIOLENCE BY THE STATE.
LET THEM HAVE THEIR VOTE AND
THEN ADJUDICATE LEADER LEE
WHETHER IT IS VALID OR NOT.
LET THE CONSEQUENCES FLOW FROM
THERE.
IT MIGHT TURN OUT THAT YES, SOME
COUNTRIES THAT WE ARE USED
TO WIND UP BREAKING APART AND
GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER
AND LATER, THEY MIGHT COME BACK
TOGETHER.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE.
I KNOW GOES BACK AND FORTH.
THERE WERE ENDLESS WARS IN
EUROPE.
HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF WAR,
THOUSANDS, ONE WAR WAS
LITERALLY HUNDRED YEARS AND THEN
THEY CAME BACK TOGETHER IN
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NOW
AGAIN, THE UK LEAVING.
THE ANSWER IS DEFINITELY NOT
VIOLENCE, IT IS DEMOCRACY
AND A LEGAL PROCESS.
IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR DEMOCRACY
IN YOUR LEGAL PROCESS, LET
THAT RAIN AND THEN YOU MIGHT
HAVE MORE CREDIBILITY WITH
THE PEOPLE OF CATALONIA.
AND JUST A QUICK, AS I DO
WANT TO DO THE STORY JUSTICE.
JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME HISTORICAL
CONTEXT, THIS IS NOT AN
ISSUE THAT JUST AROSE.
THERE WAS A SIMILAR
THOUGH BACK IN 2014
AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO
DID MAKE IT OUT TO THE
POLLS WERE LARGELY IN FAVOR OF
SEPARATING.
THE REGION HELD A SYMBOLIC
POLL IN 2014 IN WHICH 80%
OF VOTERS BACKED COMPLETE
SECESSION BUT ONLY 32%
OF THE ELECTORATE TURNED OUT.
THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT IS
ARGUING THAT OUR
CONSTITUTION INDICATES THAT IF
YOU WANT TO SEPARATE, IF YOU
WANT TO DO THIS, YOU NEED OPEN
AT THAT VOTE TO ALL SPANIARDS.
THEY MENTIONED THE SPANISH
CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO MAKE
THAT ARGUMENT AND IT WAS REVISED
IN 1978 BUT THERE WAS ALSO
SOMETHING SUPER INTERESTING THAT
HAPPENED IN THE EARLY 2000S.
BACK IN 2006, THERE WAS
ESSENTIALLY AN AGREEMENT BY THE
PARLIAMENT IN SPAIN AND
CATALONIA THAT CATALONIA
WOULD BE ITS OWN SEPARATE NATION
BUT THEN FOUR YEARS LATER,
THE COURTS CAME IN AND THEY ARE
LIKE, NO.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
SO THEY ESSENTIALLY SAID, YOU
GUYS ARE, CATALONS ARE
NATIONALITY, BUT YOU ARE NOT
YOUR OWN NATION AND SO IT HAS
GONE BACK AND FORTH FURTHER
IRRITATING PEOPLE AND
FRUSTRATING PEOPLE SO AS CENK
UYGUR MENTIONED IT IS A
DIFFICULT SITUATION,
BUT THAT IS
CURRENTLY WHAT IS GOING ON IN
SPAIN RIGHT NOW.
AND FRANCO BACK IN THE DAY,
OPPRESSED CATALONIA AND THAT IS
HOW IT STARTED IN THE FIRST
PLACE.
LET'S NOT MAKE THAT
MISTAKE.
