you think that in the aftermath of the falsified attack on an 11 year old Toronto Muslim girl that there'd be Mia culpas all around from those various elites who were so quick to pass judgment on what turned out to be a crude hoax this morning me and my brother were walking together to school and sadly um someone um insulted me by cutting my head job two times and it's my fault really scared and confused because I didn't feel comfortable that people are doing this but guess what in some circles it seems that even calling a hopes a hoax could be deemed Islamophobic in the aftermath sorry seems to be the hardest word for elected officials rather typical responses were along the lines of okay this slice of Islamophobia didn't happen but let's not pretend it isn't happening somewhere maybe the media party was even worse drop in this story like the proverbial hot potato and by far the worst media analysis post key jab hoax came via Bernie Farber hoop and a logic defying column in that hunk of fish rap known as Now magazine Farber's mind-numbing inanity begins with the very headline of his column namely he jab hoax on who now check it out hoax is in quotation marks even at this late stage of the game even after an admission by the hoaxers family that this incident is 100% halal certified phony baloney well though 6699 quotation marks frame the word hoax as if to suggest that it might be a hoax that this incident is now being reported on as a hoax Farber who used to be the executive director of the mosaic Institute is often diligent in fighting against Holocaust deniers well that's a good stand to take to be sure but this time it seems he really jumped the shark according to Farber's recent column he has miffed by how the perpetrators of the hoax are being treated for example he states the following quote for me the really sad part was reaction on social media from those who chose to berate the child to viciously condemn her and her family end quote now attacks of any kind against children well that's uncalled for wasn't the little girl's fault probably she was likely manipulated by the so-called adults in her life but generally speaking how would you expect people to react to a criminal act being carried out with sympathy with applause oh and fake news alert Farber fumbles when he misstate said Islamophobia is up 600 percent in the last year what he is presumably referring to here is a CBC report regarding online hate speech of various kinds jumping 600 percent in the year leading up to the Trump's presidency and here's some more hysteria peddled by the author he reports that protests last year condemning motion m103 were anti-muslim rallies that were held in front of downtown mosques where bigots and Islamophobes gathered to spew their hatred no Bernie the outrage by and large was directed at an ill thought-out political motion not Muslims as for the downtown mosque protest I am presuming Farber is referring to the Masjid Toronto mosque in which it was alleged that any mom had preached death to Jews and infidels odd how Farber doesn't mention that in his article so to recap in the fantasy world a Bernie Farber's column there's maybe a teensy-weensy chance that the hijab shredding incident is indeed real even though the police and the family both say it was a hoax and even if the whole thing is indeed a heaping helping of takea well we still shouldn't blame the hoaxers everyone makes mistakes after all oh and Islamophobia is up six-fold in just one year even though it isn't too bad that in going to bat for the hoaxers Farber yet again proves he just doesn't get it which is to say hoaxes like this to a true disservice to the real victims of hate crimes be they Muslim or anyone else for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
