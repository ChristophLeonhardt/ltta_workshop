1
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:03,035
DECADES.

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:04,035
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES

3
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:04,804
THAT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO

4
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:05,104
THIS.

5
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:05,871
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH THEY WILL

6
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:06,505
BRING INTO THE SUMMIT.

7
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:07,306
ALL OF IT, PRETTY COMPLEX.

8
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:08,374
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:09,208
>>> FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO

10
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,343
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN JOHN

11
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:18,050
GARAMENDI OF CALIFORNIA.

12
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,018
A MEMBER OF THE ARMED SERVICES

13
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:19,385
COMMITTEE.

14
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,052
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US.

15
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:20,720
>> GOOD EVENING.

16
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,759
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CALLING

17
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:27,326
THIS A ONE-SHOT DEAL.

18
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:28,060
THANK KIM JONG-UN WILL NOT GET

19
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,994
A SECOND CHANCE.

20
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:29,662
HE SAYS HE WILL SIZE UP THE

21
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,998
KOREAN DICTATOR IN THE FIRST

22
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:33,332
MINUTE.

23
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:33,999
WHAT DO YOU THINK, IS THIS

24
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:34,867
HISTORY IN THE MAKING OR WILL

25
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:35,534
IT BE AN EPIC FLOP?

26
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:39,671
>> LET US ALL PRAY IT WILL BE

27
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:49,314
HISTORY IN THE MAKING.

28
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:50,082
WE HOPE THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS

29
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:51,083
MOVE FORWARD IN A POSITIVE WAY.

30
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,517
THERE IS EXTRAORDINARY RISK.

31
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:53,452
MUCH OF WHAT YOUR REPORTER

32
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,286
TALKED ABOUT ARE THE DETAILS

33
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:55,520
BEYOND THIS ONE MEETING.

34
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,421
CERTAINLY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL

35
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,756
OF BEING A VERY GOOD PHOTO

36
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:58,156
OPPORTUNITY.

37
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:59,324
AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL SET THE

38
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:01,393
STAGE FOR A PATH THAT WOULD

39
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:03,996
LEAD TO FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS ON

40
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,230
ALL OF THOSE VERY COMPLEX

41
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,564
ISSUES.

42
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:09,701
NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS WHAT

43
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:10,402
IS THE ROLE OF SOUTH KOREA IN

44
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,403
ALL OF THIS AND JAPAN AND CHINA

45
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:15,374
AND RUSSIA.

46
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:16,041
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE

47
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:16,742
UNITED STATES AND NORTH KOREA.

48
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:17,809
ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE A

49
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:21,380
CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY IN GOING

50
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,713
FORWARD.

51
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:22,481
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE

52
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:23,715
ONE THING VERY WELL AND THAT IS

53
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:24,516
HE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED

54
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:27,052
THE BAR.

55
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:27,519
AND THAT'S GOOD.

56
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,220
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO

57
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:36,194
SEE DENUCLEARIZATION COME OUT

58
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:36,995
OF THIS FIRST DISCUSSION.

59
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:37,796
>> YES, OF COURSE IT WILL

60
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:38,430
HAPPEN OVER TIME.

61
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:48,573
THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO KNOW THE

62
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:49,474
NORTH KOREANS ARE SERIOUS.

63
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:50,375
THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE EVER SAT

64
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,176
DOWN ON SUCH A TOPIC AND WE

65
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,878
NEED TO KNOW THEY ARE WILLING

66
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:53,645
TO BE TRANSPARENT.

67
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:54,379
THERE ARE SENATE DEMOCRATS

68
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,080
TAKING A HARD LINE OF WHAT IT

69
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,981
WOULD TAKE TO PASS A TREATY

70
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:56,748
WITH NORTH KOREA.WHAT ARE

71
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,351
THEY SAYING?

72
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,185
>> THAT IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST

73
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:05,323
AS TOUGH AS THE IRAN DEAL WHICH

74
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:06,191
THE PRESIDENT DID BACK OUT OF.

75
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:07,492
THAT IS COMPLETE

76
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:11,429
DENUCLEARIZATION.

77
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:12,330
THAT IS ALL OF THE ELEMENTS

78
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,232
THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BUILD A

79
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:18,803
NUCLEAR BOMB ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

80
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:19,504
WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO

81
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:20,171
AWAY WITH THE INTELLECTUAL

82
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:21,072
ABILITY BUT ALL THE PHYSICAL.

83
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,707
THE ONE FELLOW THAT HAS BEEN TO

84
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:23,942
ALL OF THE NORTH KOREAN OR MOST

85
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:29,114
OF, IF NOT ALL OF THE NORTH

86
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:29,848
KOREAN NUCLEAR OPERATIONS AS IT

87
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:30,448
WILL TAKE A DECADE TO

88
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:41,126
COMPLETELY THE NUCLEAR EYES.

89
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,494
HE DID SAY HOWEVER, SOMETHING

90
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:43,628
CAN BE DONE IMMEDIATELY.

91
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,596
FOR EXAMPLE, GET RID OF THE

92
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:45,897
MOMS AND THE PHYSICAL MATERIAL

93
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:46,631
THAT WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL

94
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:46,931
BOMBS.

95
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:47,732
CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR

96
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:48,166
STEP FORWARD.

97
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,100
I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

98
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,803
UNDERSTAND THERE IS STILL A WAR

99
00:02:51,803 --> 00:03:00,578
UNDERWAY.

100
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:01,379
THERE IS AN ARMISTICE OR A

101
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:01,780
CEASE-FIRE.

102
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,847
SOUTH KOREA HAS ASKED FOR A

103
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:03,281
PEACE TREATY.

104
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,049
THAT WILL HAVE TO BE AT LEAST

105
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,650
ONE OF THE FIRST ISSUES THAT

106
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,418
COME UP IN THE SECOND, THIRD OR

107
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:07,118
FOURTH ROUNDS OF DISCUSSIONS

108
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:15,026
WHICH WILL NOT INVOLVE THE TWO

109
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:15,427
PRINCIPLES.

110
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:16,161
MY CONCERN IS WE'VE HAD TOUGH

111
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:17,262
WORDS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN

112
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,563
THE TWO PRINCIPLES.

113
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:19,297
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO GET PAST

114
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:19,597
THAT?

115
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:19,964
I HOPE SO.

116
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,666
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE KIM

117
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,233
JONG-UN.

118
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:23,368
HE IS ALSO A VERY VICIOUS AND

119
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:27,172
DANGEROUS PERSON

120
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:27,405
DANGEROUS PERSON.

121
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:28,206
>> LET'S NOT FORGET THE

122
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,107
ATROCITIES TO HIS OWN PEOPLE.

123
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:41,252
TWO AUTO OTTO WAMBIER, ALL OF

124
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:42,053
THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN CAPTURED

125
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:42,754
AND TORTURED.

126
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,089
AND THE HYDROGEN BOMB THAT HE

127
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:44,823
SUCCESSFULLY TESTED IN

128
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,424
SEPTEMBER.

129
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,392
THE WHOLE POINT IS HISTORY MAY

130
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:48,093
NOT REPEAT ITSELF.

131
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,962
WE KNOW NORTH KOREA CAN'T BE

132
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:51,296
TRUSTED.

133
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,030
GOING INTO THIS YOU KEEP BOTH

134
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,697
EYES WIDE OPEN.

135
00:03:52,697 --> 00:04:00,038
LISTEN TO SCOTT TAYLOR THAT

136
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:00,772
STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF - -

137
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:01,940
IN THAT HISTORY DOES NOT REPEAT

138
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,273
ITSELF.

139
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:02,941
>> I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

140
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:13,084
IMPORTANT.

141
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:18,356
IMPORTANT.

142
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,224
EVEN PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD HIS

143
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,125
DEAL CRAFTED IN A WAY WHERE HE

144
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,358
DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

145
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,193
SENATE AND ALL OBAMA DID THE

146
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,027
SAME THING WITH THE IRAN DEAL.

147
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:24,362
I THINK THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE,

148
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,697
BECAUSE WHAT WHAT PRESIDENT

149
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:26,397
DOES AS A DEAL, THE OTHER ONE

150
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:26,798
CAN UNDO IT.

151
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:27,599
THE ONLY WAY YOU HAVE THAT

152
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,900
LASTING IT'S A DO IT AS A

153
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,234
TREATY.

154
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:37,308
>> WHAT INTRIGUES ME IS HOW

155
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:38,042
THESE TWO NATIONS REACHED THIS

156
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:38,776
POINT WHEN TWO MONTHS AGO THEY

157
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:39,744
WERE THREATENING EACH OTHER

158
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:40,245
WITH NUCLEAR WAR.

159
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:41,779
IS KIM SERIOUS AND HOW WILL THE

160
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:42,380
PRESIDENT KNOW IF HE'S

161
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,747
BLUFFING?

162
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:43,481
>> HE SAYS HE'LL KNOW IN THE

163
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,349
FIRST MINUTE AND I DOUBT THAT.

164
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:48,887
I THINK KIM JONG-UN WILL HOLD A

165
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:49,687
LOT OF HIS CARS VERY CLOSE.

166
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:50,955
THINK HE WILL SMILE AND HE

167
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:51,689
WANTS A PHOTO OP.

168
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,624
PERHAPS MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT

169
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:53,291
DOES.

170
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,592
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE THREE

171
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:55,326
GENERATIONS OF THE KIM FAMILY

172
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:56,094
HAVE TRIED TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS

173
00:04:56,094 --> 00:05:01,533
DIRECTLY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

174
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:02,033
THE UNITED STATES.

175
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,034
THEY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED UNTIL

176
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:04,202
TOMORROW'S MOMENT.

177
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,136
THIS IS A HUGE PUBLIC RELATIONS

178
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:09,240
ISSUE BACK HOME IN NORTH KOREA.

179
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,978
SO KIM JONG-UN IS LIKELY TO BE

180
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:14,412
VERY CORDIAL.

181
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:15,446
I THINK WE WILL GET A LOT OF

182
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:16,347
SMILES.

183
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:24,055
IS HE - - ON THE PRESIDENT,

184
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:24,522
LET'S HOPE NOT.

185
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:25,390
THIS WILL NOT BE SIMPLE AND I'M

186
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,758
NOT SURE A TREATY WILL BE

187
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:32,330
SUFFICIENT.

188
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,164
IT IS CERTAINLY A MAJOR AND

189
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:34,065
IMPORTANT STEP BUT DO KEEP IN

190
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:34,899
MIND, THE UNITED STATES HAS

191
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,100
BACKED AWAY FROM A TREATY AS

192
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,501
