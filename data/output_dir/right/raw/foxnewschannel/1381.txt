1
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:03,250
CLIFTON.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,352
ALL RIGHT, KENNEDY, THIS IS YOUR

3
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:06,753
KIND OF TOPIC.

4
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:08,154
YOU GO FOR IT.

5
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:12,025
>> I AGREE WITH WHAT CANDACE

6
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:13,627
OWENS SAID ABOUT EDUCATION.

7
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:20,400
THE FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES WITH

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,037
THOUGHT SUPPRESSION START

9
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:26,340
YOUNGER THAN COLLEGE.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,575
THEY AREN'T ALLOWED TO FIND

11
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,610
THEIR PASSIONS.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,078
WE DON'T HAVE REAL SCHOOL CHOSE

13
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,378
IN THE COUNTRY.

14
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:38,819
WE RELY ON A VERY OUT DATE --

15
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,721
OUTDATED METHOD CONTROLLED BY

16
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:43,590
UNIONS AND PARENTS ARE DISTANCED

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,993
FROM HELPING THEIR KIDS LEARN.

18
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,794
WITHIN THAT DISTANCING AND LACK

19
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:49,830
OF ACTUAL SCHOOL CHOSE IN THE

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:59,339
COUNTRY YOU SEE A LACK OF

21
00:00:59,339 --> 00:00:59,706
CURIOUSTY.

22
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,108
THEN THEY GO TO COLLEGE.

23
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:03,977
I DON'T SHARE YOUR BLANKET

24
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:05,212
OPTIMISM THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WILL

25
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:07,614
START THIS REVOLUTION BECAUSE I

26
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:09,449
FRANKLY THINK NOT ONLY HAVE THEY

27
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:12,085
GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF PRIVACY BUT

28
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:18,025
THEY ALSO, IT'S LIKE A STRANGE

29
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:21,862
CULTURAL THING ABOUT NOT

30
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:21,895
CULTURAL THING ABOUT BOT

31
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:22,696
CULTURAL THING ABOUT BEING TOLD

32
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:23,897
WHAT TO DO.

33
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:27,034
>> IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO,

34
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:29,102
FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE LIKE US.

35
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:31,371
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO

36
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,839
CORRECT US.

37
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,308
>> THE SCHOOL CHOSE POINT IS

38
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:34,708
VITAL.

39
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:38,545
THAT'S A POLICY SOLUTION WE CAN

40
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:38,879
PURSUE.

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,181
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN GET

42
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:43,583
THEM MORE FREEDOM LOVING.

43
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,519
>> FIGHT LIKE HELL, TALK TO YOUR

44
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:45,919
KIDS.

45
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:49,289
IT'S CRITICAL WE CONTINUE TO

46
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,893
PARENT AND DON'T RELY ON

47
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:53,226
SCHOOLS.

48
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,529
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE TO HAVE THE

49
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:58,165
DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR KIDS.

50
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:04,137
NOT JUST ABOUT SEX, DRUGS, AND

51
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,839
AND INDIVIDUALISM AND FIGHTING

52
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,976
FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

53
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:10,110
UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE FORM OF

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,112
MIND CONTROL WE PROJECT ON OUR

55
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:15,148
KIDS SOMETIMES IN SCHOOLS THERE

56
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:23,623
IS A BIT OF A GULF AND WE HAVE

57
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,559
TO FIGHT AT THAT LEVEL AND TEACH

58
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:28,195
THEM TO BE WARRIORS FOR FREEDOM

59
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:31,331
AND THOUGHT.

60
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,067
STEVE: THERE YO GO, I AGREE.

61
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,570
MARJORIE AREN'T YOU EMBARRASSED

62
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,006
WITH THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

63
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,908
BECOME SO INTOLERANT.

64
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:44,378
>> I DON'T OWN WHAT ANY PERSON

65
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,913
IS OUT THERE DOING OR SAYING

66
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,015
REGARDLESS OF PARTY.

67
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:58,058
WHAT WE ARE MISSING IS

68
00:02:58,058 --> 00:02:58,425
SUVILLITY.

69
00:02:58,425 --> 00:02:59,760
WE ARE LACKING EMPTY.

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,995
THAT MEANS THE ABILITY TO NOT

71
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:04,831
JUST LOOK AT THINGS FROM OUR OWN

72
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,233
PROSPECTIVE BUT SEE THEM FROM

73
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:06,533
MANY.

74
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:09,369
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEORIES OF

75
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:10,070
THOUGHT.

76
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,006
CANDACE LAID OUT HER OWN IDEAS

77
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,741
WHAT THE POLITE OF THE BLACK

78
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,343
COMMUNITY IS AND THEIR

79
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,177
CHALLENGES TODAY.

80
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,979
ONE BLACK PERSONS EXPERIENCE IS

81
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,414
NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER.

82
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:24,251
JUST LIKE ONE WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE

83
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,286
IS NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER.

84
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,989
WE ENDANGER OURSELF WITH WHERE

85
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,259
WE ARE CULTURALLY IN THIS

86
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:32,592
WARFARE.

87
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:36,196
WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING OUT WITH

88
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:40,133
VERY BLATANT IDEAS WITH THE WAY

89
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,135
THE WORLD WORKS.

90
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,371
THIS DISREGARD A LOT OF OTHER

91
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,807
PEOPLES EXPERIENCES.

92
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:49,342
FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL MEANS WE

93
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:52,879
ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW OUR

94
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,116
ACTIONS AND WORDS AND BELIEFS

95
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,217
IMPACT ALL OF US.

96
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:59,453
THE FREEDOM IS TO HAVE OUR OWN

97
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:10,263
IDEAS AND THOUGHTS

98
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,302
THE FREEDOM IS TO HAVE OUR OWN
IDEAS AND THOUGHTS AND SAVILITY.

99
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:15,802
>> TY.

100
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,036
STEVE: YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING.

101
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:22,476
IF YOU DEAR EXPRESS A POINT OF

102
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:25,212
VIEW OUT OF LINE YOU ARE SHOUTED

103
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:25,779
DOWN.

104
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:30,350
HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?

105
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,020
>> I AGREE THAT'S NOT A

106
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,555
PRODUCTIVE WAY FOR US IN THIS

107
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,457
COUNTRY TO BE APPROACHING

108
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:37,824
ANYTHING.

109
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:44,598
I ABSOLUTELY I SEE IT ON BOTH

110
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,233
SIDES OF THE I'LL.

111
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,869
YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH WHAT KANYE

112
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:57,444
SAID AND NOT INSULT HIM AT THE

113
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,245
SAME TIME.

114
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,580
YOU CAN HAVE DISCOURSE AND

115
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,949
CONVERSATION AND EXCEPT AND

116
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,718
UNDERSTAND AND FIND A SOLUTION

117
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:05,085
TOGETHER.

118
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:08,855
WE'LL BE IN THE SAME THING RIGHT

119
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,256
NOW.

120
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:11,992
THAT'S WHAT THE EXCITEMENT

121
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,059
AROUNDTRUM.  WAS AND IS.

122
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:15,996
HE TAPPED INTO SOMETHING PEOPLE

123
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,998
WEREN'T LISTENING TO IN THE

124
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:18,598
COUNTRY.

125
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:20,734
43% OF AMERICANS DON'T HAVE $400

126
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:25,972
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY THERE IS

127
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,274
SOMETHING REAL HAPPENING.

128
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:28,375
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

129
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,910
AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE

130
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,445
THINGS HE DOES THAT LEAVE OUT

131
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:35,182
ANOTHER AREA OF THE COUNTRY OR

132
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:44,891
MAKE PEOPLE EITHER MINORITIES

133
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,393
SOCIOECONOMIC PEOPLE FEEL LEFT

134
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:46,860
OUT.

135
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,264
>> I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT.

136
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,867
KENNEDY, TO WRAP IT UP THE WAY

137
00:05:53,867 --> 00:06:00,140
ANY KIND OF DEVIATION FROM THE

138
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,578
ORTHODOXY MEANS YOU CAN'T HAVE

139
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:05,779
THE CIVILITY.

140
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:15,589
>> I FEEL LIKE IT'S UNREAL.

141
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,224
THIS IS THE SAME PERSON THAT

142
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,759
BLAMED TRUMP SUPPORTERS FOR

143
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,661
BEING RACIST AND SEXIST.

144
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:24,698
SHE CALLED THEM A BASKET OF

145
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,433
DEPLOYABLES AND RELIED ON

146
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,568
IDENTITY POLITICS TO GET HER

147
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,135
ELECTED.

148
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,538
>> IT DIDN'T GET HER ELECTED.

149
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,073
>> I'M NOT DONE.

150
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:34,074
>> SORRY.

151
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,542
>> HANG ON ONE SECOND.

152
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:39,512
YOU JUST MADE A HUGE

153
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:39,946
CONTRADICTION.

154
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:40,914
YOU HAVE HILLARY CLINTON SAYING

155
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:42,816
THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL

156
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,951
FOR WOMEN WHO DON'T SUPPORT EACH

157
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:45,252
OTHER.

158
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,487
YOU HAVE TO THINK AS A GROUP, AS

159
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:48,488
A CLUSTER.

160
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,790
YOU HAVE TO SAY WE HAVE TO HAVE

161
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,460
EMPTY FOR OUR INDIVIDUAL

162
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,362
EXPERIENCES BUT WE CAN'T JUST

163
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,397
RELY ON INDIVIDUALS AND

164
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:57,964
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT.

165
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:59,799
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

166
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,735
MOST PEOPLE DON'T BUY IT BECAUSE

167
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:10,277
WHEN YOU SAY THE WORD EMPATHY.

168
00:07:10,277 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I DO MEAN IT.
