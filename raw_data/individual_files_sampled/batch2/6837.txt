were several days into this insane feud that has developed out of the military situation in usurer just a couple of weeks ago and it's gone through multiple iterations and the latest one that were on is there is this concerted effort coming out of the White House to discredit the congresswoman Frederica Wilson because she happened to be present for a presidential phone call to the widow of a soldier a slain in the field and the willingness to play fast and loose with facts about speeches that have been given coming not just out of Donald Trump where we would expect it but out of generals like John Kelly is is certainly disappointing and so we're gonna show how the most recent attack by John Kelly during his emotional speech yesterday about what it's like to be a father who has lost a soldier in combat we're gonna break down some of the the mistruths that were spread during that speech but first in case you didn't see it here is General John Kelly and a congresswoman stood up and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building now she took care of her constituents because she got the money and she just called up President Obama and on that phone call he gave the money the twenty million dollars to build a building she sat down and we were stunned stunned that she'd done it even for someone that is that empty of barrel we were stunned but you know none of us went to the press and criticized none of us stood up and were appalled we just said okay fine it's an organic totally not planned narrative when you use the expression empty barrel like three times right in a minute long a bit of a speech there yes so also saying there there was the little Chiron at the bottom that said stunned that she would listen in on the call there's this complete lack of interest in actually understanding the relationship between this congresswoman and not just the widow but the soldier who was actually killed and that would allow you to understand exactly why the situation played out the way it was and we're gonna get to the substance of it we're gonna play a little bit of the speech that shows how wrong he was there but there's this inability in the White House to understand when you've made a little error and simply kill it just by apologize move on they have to double down and Donald Trump's need to do that draws in people like John Kelly into giving his speech like that that I'm sure he had no interest in giving it was probably pushed into but anyway he says there she's an empty barrel grandstanding apparently this recent situation is just an example of it because you can go back and see other examples like when she took credit for this FBI a building so here is the actual speech that she gave that he was alluding to the brand new federal building that will house the FBI has been built and the FBI approaches my office congresswoman Weber Wilson the ribbon cutting has been scheduled in four short weeks the dedication is on the government's calendar and cannot be changed one problem the FBI wants to name this gorgeous benefits at the same time in four weeks everyone said that's impossible it takes at least eight months to a year to complete the process through the House the Senate and to the president's office I said I'm a school principal and I said it's my friend oh hell no we're gonna get this guy immediately I went to an attack mode I went to the speaker Speaker Boehner and I said Mr Speaker I need your help the FBI I need your help and our country needs your help and we have no time to waste he went into attack mode and in two days pulled it out of committee brought it to the floor for a vote representative Cobell and I presented it we all voted and I dashed it over to the Senate and put our senators on notice put it on your radar senator Nelson and senator Rubio who I believe have representatives here today they hot lined it to the Senate floor in just two days and guess what the President signed the bill into law this past Tuesday April 7th 2015 it is a miracle to say the least but it speaks to the respect that our Congress has for the Federal Bureau of Investigation the men and women who put their lives on the line every single day and today we're providing a boost to our neck so it goes on like that but what you see there is that she is talking about the process I mean at this dedication of getting some additional funding and to the extent that that she's grandstanding she's also giving credit to basically everyone else along the way yeah anecdote about finalizing something for the building and not what general Kelly said which is claiming she got the money to build the building and made it all about herself you could say that she's giving a rambling anecdote and that's what politicians do unfortunately but to say that this is an example of her trying to take credit for everything herself and to discredit her so that you can't believe that she represents that Widow who has come out and confirmed that Trump said what he said Trump's own people in the White House have confirmed that he said what he said and they're attempting to muddy the waters that confuse you about the entire thing well you know and just as a testament to the anecdote that she was giving you know James Comey was at that dedication as well he was the FBI director then and he it was in his prepared remarks as well discussing the importance of that having a name for their dedication and how quickly the congresswoman was able to provide the the sort of the initial boost to get that to happen mean he I mean it was really a big deal for them yeah and so it wasn't like she was out of left field either I mean there it was a part of their prepared remarks I mean I and I think it just goes back to the fact that that this is a reflection of and I know this is an easy go to but it's also true of what Trump's MO is is as sort of this burgeoning autocratic approach which is to cash in on other people to make them go out there and subjugate themselves I've watched every time he's pulled Kelly on stage he's done it multiple times and every event called Kelly says not a single word he just nods points to the president and claps and everybody cheers and he walks away yeah he had to give this speech just like Tillerson had to do with three weeks ago and I didn't say he wasn't moron I mean every time he makes people go out there and do that and eventually cast them all that's exactly right right he just burns their credibility down and then sort of moves on and I think that's a reflection of his overall approach yeah yeah I mean look I wish that there hadn't been this weird tangent in the news but I do think it's important especially for Trump supporters to understand that you know once you you forget about that the John Kelly and the Wilson thing but the the disrespect given routinely from Donald Trump to the gold star families and all that that that is important I don't know that it'll actually penetrate any of his supporters that they'll they'll be affected by it he has been routinely disrespectful towards the military for multiple years now at this point but that is something and hopefully once this has been resolved we can get back to the real story which is what actually happened in Africa how we got to that situation not just what actually happened that night but why that situation developed there was um last night I believe Rachel Maddow talked a little bit about some of the policy decisions that might have led to that having to do with Chad and things like that so you can do that research as well but that is an interesting situation the reason we have this tangent is because Donald Trump refused to go on record about what actually happened on the ground there and it might well be I saw this editorial and it was um don't make this situation into Trump's Benghazi and well I actually think is this is exactly like Benghazi not what Benghazi became but what it actually was which is a military situation that ended in tragedy and more than likely although information is still coming in including today that resulted in some bad decisions a lack of planning in this case it seems like probably an over-reliance on unreliable private contractors which we talk about a lot on the show that there's no huge conspiracy there's just irresponsibility and poor decision-making but we didn't actually get to have that conversation because Donald Trump refused to actually go on the record and talk about what happened to try to cover for the incompetence on the ground and made the situation so much worse because he refused to be forthcoming yeah I mean you're exactly right in fact during this and when this whole thing was first happening I thought I hope the press is going to ask about why our troops are there what that mission is all about of course that's not what happened it ended up being a whole question of how come you waited so long to call the families and and it turned into what we've just been talking about but the specifics also of how how Trump has tarnished and how Kelly and this administration has tarnished this congresswoman how she was listening in on the call when in truth it mean a mix it there's a sense that everybody's sitting around and she's listening on the extension you know it was a widow put it on speakerphone because she was re see get there to do that he was driving to pick up the the corpse of her dead son and the congressman was accompanying her and the call came in and it was on the speakerphone there's nothing damning about that scenario yeah and it explains as you say the relationship between the congresswoman and the family and that fallen soldier yeah but the fact that it has been politicized until you to use the overused word but it's quite appropriate but also that it's been used to somehow tarnish this very proud family and this congresswoman is just abhorrent to man yeah and again look obviously this whole situation very important but but I agree like at some point the real story is even outside of this one incident it's the contextual battle that's going on in this region and I I believe today I forget who it was the senator talking about how it might have been Lindsey Graham talking about how the war is shifted to Africa and it's a complicated region multiple countries bordering najar are dealing with situations with terrorist groups that are at least affiliated with Isis or at least philosophically aligned to some extent with Isis and people need to know about that there needs to be a conversation about the number of troops that are there what the mission is how do we assess if it's been successful or not are we simply going to leave them for years on end as we have in other areas how many troops are actually there is it a hundred or is it a thousand that seems important I think that we should probably know that and we are still waiting for some information to come out about this particular incident it will come out there's an investigation ongoing but in particular the hold the private contractor that that sent the the rescue that the helicopter if it was their fault for leaving behind a soldier we need to know that and we have been long overdue for a larger conversation about the role of private military contractors in our operations and maybe this could be one of the things that leads to that I'm so glad you mentioned private contractors because just it quickly there is a big move Erik Prince the Blackwater head there the big contractors who made out like crazy on the Iraq war he is pushing and he did it in New York Times editorial he is pushing for the privatization of all of these wars that we contract all of these different things out that now is the time to privately contract all these different skirmishes and war theaters out and this is the administration to help him do it if ever there was a time in this country when we would hand over the keys to our military to private contractors it's now so just keep your eye on that ball as this entire debate continues anything to do with the military keep your eye on the private contractor part of that equation if you like this clip of The Young
