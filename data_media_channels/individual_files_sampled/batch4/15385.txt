a few weeks ago some people most of whom were on the left went absolutely berserk when the government shutdown backpage.com and seized its digital property as of April 6 progressives who champion people who are sex workers lost their freaking minds over it it was a pretty embarrassing spectacle for them considering the reason the back page was shut down is because seven of their executives were indicted on I think 93 counts including money laundering and prostitution some of their prostitution ads featured underage sex trafficking victims now you would think that something like this shutting it down everyone would be in support of right-wrong many liberal publications sympathize with poor old Backpage and sex workers and published mischaracterizing absurd articles like these from The Guardian and Newsweek when that PAC page investigation excuse me is one of the higher profile cases in a string of trafficking related arrests in the month following president Trump's inauguration his first month in office the Justice Department made 1,500 arrests related to human trafficking know very clearly the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his Co Jay have been hammering down on these crimes and recently Smallville actress Alison Mac was arrested for her part in a group called n XIV M it's pronounced nexium ironically like the acid reflux drug acid reflux which would be the least of your issues if you actually joined this cult but the ring leader of it all is a guy named Keith Rainier he started a company called executive success program ESP which apparently in an attempt to remarket after a slew of problems bankruptcy etc he renamed it in XIV M and now it's called ethyl ogia but getting back to Allison Mac along with Renier and other she was charged with sex trafficking sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor in connection to nexium multiple celebrities have been implicated but it just came to light that aliceandmac in an attempt to recruit other entertainers to the group reached out to Kelly Clarkson and emma watson mack tweeted at emma watson first in 2016 she said this at emma watson a fellow actress like yourself and involved in an amazing women's movement and I think you'll dig it love to chat if you're open well Watson clearly wasn't open so Mac tweeted at her yet again a month later saying this at M Watson I participate in a unique human development and women's movement I'd love to tell you about as a fellow actress I can relate so well to your vision and what you want to see in the world I think we could work together let me know if you're willing to chat smart move on Emma Watson's part not replying she was probably busy filming that little franchise called what's it called Harry Potter yeah and didn't have time to reply about joining a cult same with Kelly Clarkson Mac tweeted to her in 2013 at Kelly Clarkson I heard through the grapevine that you're a fan of Smallville I'm a fan of yours as well I'd love to chat sometime well Allison I don't think anyone is going to be joining your pyramid scheme turned cult turned sex trafficking ring because the cats out of the bag on you and your colleagues disgusting actions Mac faces a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted it's a good thing that she's not currently working on any TV series because that would be really bad for show business thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.fafsa.gov and ahead for the rebel
