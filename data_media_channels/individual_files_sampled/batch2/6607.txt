hey everybody look at this wonderful little panel I mean we can't call it a power panel it's not a Friday but Calculon ski Jehu Granicus Parian three people who I believe it is fair to say just ripped up pol√≠tica so I feel a little uncomfortable between Anna and Kyle because when they're on a panel together it's utter destruction and oh no but a panel will go through them okay I won't oppose you guys I won't oppose you guys okay so obviously we had an interesting weekend and there were many debates we didn't even get the ketchup on your debate with Scottie Nell Hughes yeah I want to in the postgame sure sure and and and I took on tear across him but we're gonna talk about those and then Charlie Kirk and his son Pike or that turned into something interesting all I know is he lives his life like a cab so we're gonna talk about it in the postgame a little bit but also a little bit later in this program I'm gonna explain the four different debating styles of the four people that I've debated over the last seven years in Politico and Dinesh D'Souza agriculture tucker carlson and ben shapiro will talk about it in this show and then we'll talk a little bit about what i would have said the tucker carlson if the debate had gone in a different direction we'll do that in the postgame interesting I've got a whole bunch of notes I can share with you guys just you guys that's for the members toi t.com /join to become a member we had a lot of stories today I'm excited about a lot of them including the Karen one Caravan one which is a little bit later in the program and the new tax cuts that Trump is promising those are two stories riddled with insanity of Trump of the Republicans so but there's plenty of insanity to go around Kyle's gonna do the first hour Kyle take it away that's right here we go a lot of stuff to get to so we have some important updates on Jamal Ashoke I hope I'm pronouncing that right although I mess it up every other day he's of course the Saudi journalist killed by Saudi Arabia we also have some load some responses to share with you but first let's go to the hill they report the following an individual suspected of being part of the group of Saudis involved in the death of journalist Jamal khashoggi was reportedly seen around Istanbul wearing Yogi's clothes a fake beard and glasses on the day of the killing CNN citing a senior Turkish official reported that the man in the video identified as Mustafa al-madani was captured by surveillance cameras leaving the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the day khashoggi died there he appears to be wearing the same clothes Khashoggi was seen wearing when he entered the consulate Turkish investigators have said they have audio and other evidence that proves Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by a group of Saudis in the consulate the Turkish official told CNN that al-madani was used as a body double in the operation so what we're looking at here is and this really you know really struck me that it's so concerted and so organized and so planned that it really seems like like a smoke-filled back room in a way and I always try to avoid the smoke-filled back room conspiracies whenever possible but this is one of those instances where you're like the dude wore a fake beard I mean that is wild so Trump is waffling on this and he's saying I would love it if NBS didn't do it and he's basically you know trying to play both sides and pretend like he's tough on crime but at the same time trying to keep the us-saudi alliance intact and yeah it's just a mess so explain why it is that they would use the body double was it the Saudis attempts to make it seem as though Khashoggi had left the consulate yes yeah so two natural conclusions come out of that right well one part is surprising those natural conclusions are if you bring a bone saw and an autopsy expert and a body double it wasn't something that happened by accident right over end of this it's not even close that's up super-obvious if the bonesaw for some insane reason did not convince you because you watch Fox News or something well the body doubles got to do it doesn't it I mean who brings a body double to an accidental killing I think that's a thing so second conclusion which actually haunts me in some ways more is I I don't think they could have possibly have known what Khashoggi was going to wear that and so I believe that is a show he's actual clothes yeah I think they took it off of them before they killed him because they obviously doesn't have blood on him and remember they likely chopped off his fingers while he was still alive so likely they stripped him naked tortured him and it's all on audio apparently so the Turkish government has that they keeps threatening to use it and release it in fact they say they're gonna release it tomorrow so we'll see and so naked tortured parts of his body chopped off and then killed and then beheaded and dismembered we believe but we're not positive about the order we don't know if they beheaded him to kill him so anyone trying to say that this was not premeditated is an obvious obvious liar well thankfully the moral voice of our generation Pat Robertson has some thoughts on this for us so let's take a look at that I'll say it now and I'll say it over and over again we've got the cooler rhetoric and what the president is trying to do is to give the Saudis and out and calls for sanctions and calls for punitive action against the Saudis is not is ill-advised and Wendy I just don't think you've got a hundred billion dollars worth of arm sales which is you know that's one of those things but more than that we've got to have some Arab allies we have to have it we cannot alienate a biggest player in the Middle East whose bulwark against Iran but can we have somebody that's killing journalists that are US residents is the question you know we've had so many people killed I mean we had CIA people killed in Lebanon that people have been taking hostage here over the years I know it's bad but I mean we've had all kinds of stuff but you don't blow up an international alliance over one person I mean I'm sorry oh what a great Christian thoughts are on reproductive rights right when it comes to zygotes I'm sure he's very much concerned about you know being pro-life but when it comes to living breathing human beings who happen to be journalists who get murdered well you know these things happen what are you gonna do I mean there was some CIA people at some time in the past you know that's that's a great point Anna and I hadn't thought about it in that context imagine if the Saudis had committed an abortion on purpose would Pat Robertson see it completely differently wait a minute I didn't know the Saudis were that terrible they're killing what they would consider to be people before they're born after they're born dismembering them and beheading them is perfectly fine if you got an arms deal at stake but before they're bored that's an outrage before they're an actual person oh my god we got to protect him I I don't know but there actually is no bounce to Robertson's hypocrisy so he might even say oh they did an abortion what's one abortion when we got an arms deal yeah look imagine if he applied that logic back in the day to the guy who started his religion oh yeah I mean we got to deal with the Roman Empire what's one guy compared to a gigantic deal with we have with the biggest empire in the world I mean this one little guy from Nazareth what does he matter I liked how he ignores all of the parts of the Bible that are just pacifist you know and this really shows that he puts political ideology above everything else and it shows that he'll fall in line behind Donald Trump come hell or high water because he actually views him kind of as his demigod more than he used the words of his own Lord and Savior so I find this it's just strange to me that you can have Christians who are really good people you know like dr. Martin Luther King jr. for example who use the message of the Bible for all the right reasons then you could also get the polar opposite philosophy to the point where it's comical mm-hmm I don't even think robertson is trying to preach anything from the bible anymore I mean after Trump got elected you're right he does see Trump as this God figure in fact he thinks that Donald Trump was chosen by God to be president he has now become you know another propaganda arm of the Trump administration in addition to Fox News so Jake you know just to answer the question of whether or not he would be upset if the Saudis had forced an abortion I don't think he would be upset because I do think that politics go above anything else including his so-called religious beliefs but Pat Robertson actually doubled down after getting criticized for this and he is the same talking point that Trump uses which is no but you guys won't understand the Saudi arms deal is important because of jobs okay that is a lie and I wanted to look into that that claim and actually give you guys some of the numbers so first off how many jobs does the US defense industry employ about 355,000 so Trump claims oh no this this specific Saudi arms deal has led to 500,000 jobs in in typical Trump fashion he keeps changing the numbers to suit whatever point he's trying to make so back in January of this year when MBS was in visiting in Washington Trump had claimed that this Saudi arms deal was going to provide about 40,000 new jobs fast-forward to today with this whole Khashoggi controversy all of a sudden just to justify selling weapons to Saudi Arabia he's now saying 500,000 there have been some cases where he's said 600,000 so how many jobs is it it's certainly not 600,000 not 500,000 and again just to emphasize or re-emphasize the US defense industry employs three hundred fifty five thousand five hundred jobs for the entire industry exactly and by the way he said on now doses of occasions it's a hundred billion dollar deal it's 110 billion dollar deal it's fourteen and a half billion me you could say fourteen and a half billion that's still a lot of money right no but he's got embellish he has the embellish on the numbers on the jobs and in the amount of money that would come in and the pat robertson's of the world of course I'm questioningly unquestioningly have his back I was also amused they had prosperity gospel preacher paula white on in a different situation in Pat Robertson's channel talking about how well if you look at the Bible it appears that Jesus is an immigrant but he's not he's not he never broke any of the laws okay and he did he have documents was undocumented right he's also brown by the way which you know I don't think they're very comfortable with that fact right if he existed at all I should say he's brown that's the reason in the world he's from that's right they twist everything to try to fit their political agenda and their political agenda has nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus Christ now speaking of political agenda I have one more video for you I think you're gonna like this Rush Limbaugh also weighed in on this take a look I continue to get emails about these the so-called Washington Post journalist Jamal khashoggi my question is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration this is anybody see a disparity here in proportion where was this concern everywhere I don't know about you guys but I saw Benghazi absolutely everywhere and it's weird because he's saying this in service of the point okay let's ignore the kesaji thing because let's not go after Donald Trump yeah so we had about twenty eight hearings on Benghazi so that that's one of your answers second of all there was no armed steel or other relationship we had to the people who did the killings in Benghazi if there was we all would have been massively in favor of cutting off that arms deal they killed our ambassador they killed three other people that's terrible does anybody think we had a relationship with those guys no the made up charges the Republicans said at the time is that somehow the Democrats should have known about the attack and the terrorists intentions ahead of time and then afterwards should have said other words about it but no one claims that we had a secret deal with the people who did the killings in this case we have a giant deal the devil Trump won't shut up about what the guys who did the killings that's a massive difference of course you have to assume if you're Rush Limbaugh that your audience is not that bright so you'll be able to escape that by them including the incredibly obnoxious beginning to that that's so-called Washington Post journalist what's the so called part of it he wrote for the Washington Post he was a calmness for them for a year now you just want to smear the guy in every imaginable way and I honestly don't care who or what he was anyway exactly he was dismembered by the Saudi government which seems to be the you know the big point there so and now finally let's go to that issue right so these same guys Pat Robertson Rush Limbaugh Donald Trump are the ones who told you the Muslims are the problem we got we got to keep him out of the country till we figure out what the hell is going on and I mean rush limbaugh how many segments that he do about the evil Muslims now I would add fundamentalist Muslims but that's a distinction we make that's not even a distinction of Rush Limbaugh or Pat Robertson makes or Donald Trump but I mean if you were talking about evil fundamentalist Muslims it doesn't get any more so than the Saudi leadership and so not only it was that the case before this killing but now Pat Robertson and Rush Limbaugh are defending the most extremist Islamic fundamentalists that just beheaded and dismembered someone get a load of that twisted logic and a lot of their followers are like well of course we're of course Pro Muslim beheadings haven't we said that all along yes it amazing it is amazing and I think that this whole story further proves that the right wing only uses Muslims for the sole purpose of fear-mongering that they themselves know that the general Muslim population doesn't really serve as a threat to the United States doesn't serve as a national security threat to the United States what they do is exploit people's fear to win elections to spread propaganda to you know pass anti-immigration legislation or at least anti-immigration initiatives and so if they were really concerned about the damage that Muslims would do they would be outraged by this but at the end of the day it's all about the money it's all about protecting political interests it's all about covering up for Trump helping Trump cover up for the Saudis I mean it's a really disgusting story especially when you consider the precedent it sets for journalists period I mean this says hey if you're a journalist the US government will not look out for you and will not you know try to get justice on your behalf if you get murdered by Saudi royals or any other government especially if there's a financial interest to keep those ties yes any government that we profit off of right and in the case of Donald Trump he actually has made this clear on several occasions up to your point about Muslims in general he said oh the Saudis why would I be opposed to the Saudis they pay me forty to fifty million dollars for apartment of course I'm not gonna be opposed to the Saudis he literally said that he and if you don't know this not only the Saudis switch as soon as Donald Trump won the presidency switch all their hotel rooms from other hotels all the Trump properties I mean this bribery is not is not veiled very much I know the Saudis are into veiling but apparently not bad but in some cases they literally took out hotel rooms giant blocks of hotel rooms in Trump hotels and never went just bribes its bribes out in the open and Trump says why would I be opposed to the Saudis they keep paying me of course I'm not opposed to the Saudis oh it's non rich Muslims that I'd like to fear monger about well I actually have the worst of the worst of fundamentalist Muslims that pay me money so I like them in fact in this case he said nobody's told me he's responsible referring to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or as I'm calling him now bonesaw Salman he said nobody's told me he's not responsible we haven't reached that point I would love if he wasn't responsible yep I would love if he was a response well now the finally the thing that they're a little agitated about is that the Saudis bungled lying so badly that it's hard to cover up for them they're dying to cover up for them but it's may mean a really hard one to the question I raised originally if you had the body double why don't you use it as an alibi like I don't know why they did the body available and then they didn't use it maybe think it's just they're like oh yeah as soon as it happened like oh that was a really bad idea he's got an obviously fake beard they immediately identify who he is right so I guess scrapped that plan and in the beginning of course he they said no he walked out alive and the Saudi officials officials said that saying no we know for sure he walked out alive now when they asked Donald Trump even he had a tough time justifying that he had to tell the Washington Post yeah that one was inconsistent you know why they fumbled it and why they didn't use the body double because the Turks were eavesdropping on the whole situation like they had bugged the room and they have you know based on what we know and I am taking it at face value they say they have the audio recordings of the whole you know murder basically so other evidence so if I were you know with the Saudis if I were Saudi royalty and I knew all about that all this I wouldn't go to the body double because the body double doesn't matter it's clear that it's a body double if the Turks have the evidence that they say they have yeah now we know not only do they not care about the genocide happening in Yemen with our weapons they also don't care about dead journalists exactly okay so now let's jump to something that's quite different but I think also very interesting Mitch McConnell was recently confronted in a restaurant with his wife by some angry protesters so this happened at a popular Cuban restaurant in Louisville Kentucky take a look I'm going to sell it to tansy they threw their left oh they also I don't think you saw it there but that somebody also went on to throw out his food and there were multiple people who came up and basically yelled at him and I'm curious what you guys think about this because I have to say um I have very mixed feelings and I feel like on all these similar stories I have very mixed feelings so recently happened with Ted Cruz where Ted Cruz was in a restaurant with his wife and you know you had the protesters basically shout him down and shout him out of the restaurant now on the one hand I think it's definitely fair to say that the people who are doing the shouting I mean that is literally free speech like you're allowed to go up to somebody and scream it then obviously you shouldn't do any physical assault that's illegal that should be illegal I think we all agree to that but I don't know because I feel like what if in these situations it actually works in the sense that it makes their voting records 5% less terrible and that can make a real difference in people's lives now on the flip side let's not pretend that this doesn't make people look kind of unhinged especially if somebody's watching this and they don't happen to know how terrible of a person and a politician Mitch McConnell is I feel like a casual viewer could look at this and be like well obviously the left is so unhinged and dumb and wrong and this is not how we should be you know fighting back so I don't know I'm curious what you guys think I've always had mixed feelings on this kind of stuff yeah let me just preface this by saying that I will always disagree with anything that gets physical including throwing his leftovers out on the sidewalk that's unacceptable don't touch him don't touch his food don't touch his property that's when you lose me 100% now with that said I've asked myself several times how I would feel if people were shouting at me based on my political opinions and if I would feel comfortable advocating for someone you know yelling at Mitch McConnell or Trump or any of the other goons like what I feel comfortable with them doing that to these elected officials if I'm not comfortable with someone shouting at me based on my political views but we were just a politican had plenty of people shouting at me based on all of us are a little bit and here's the thing it is free speech and they're allowed to do that and I believe that as Americans we should be allowed to voice our concerns toward these elected officials and so I have no problem with someone raising their voice at a Mitch McConnell or any politician if they believe that this politician has done something divisive has done something that has actually ruined the lives of certain Americans whatever it is you should you have a protection a constitutional protection to be able to do that and if you can't handle it maybe it's time to rethink your political ideology do you think it's effective though because that's one of the core things that I'm stuck on is I don't know if it's effective or if maybe it might even make it worse I don't know yeah so I've you gonna be shocked to find out strong opinions about this but it's nuanced and then there's different lines in different places so first of all I agree and I'm amused that the right-wing who are claimed to be free speech absolutist will then turn around and say a mob it's a mob I can't believe they're speaking freely let's note that irony and move forward so in terms of what the ground rules should be if we're making ground rules one is I'm with Ana on yelling is OK from time to time I'm gonna explain what I think are the important caveat but that happens to me all the time not just at political but I'll be walking down the street in New York or I'll be at an airport and some guy will yell at the top of his lungs alright and if you want to like scream obscenities in the middle of an airport that's on you brother okay and it doesn't bother me at all I'm actually slightly amused by it so I think that's okay I think for a politician it's even more okay but so where are the lines first of all I think everyone should agree to Anna's lines nothing physical ever so to me two places where this guy is clearly out of bounds and this is a second guy there was actually an earlier protester as well I'll tell you about him in a sec or her this I went out of bounds by banging his fists on their table and I think that crosses a line and later they had to go food leftover so they were gonna take home and he grabbed it and threw it on the sidewalk no no don't touch their stuff okay and and value leftovers okay I know I okay so and then the third part of it I think or second depending on Howard County is there has to be some time limit to it okay if you're stalking someone and you keep following them it then it gets concerning right so and for me and then some people will disagree with this don't go to their house I think that that's really dangerous I think it's a bad idea there's plenty of unhinge people mainly on the right but there could be some on the left and I don't want anybody at anybody's houses okay that's that's crazy even if you ask me I think that's crazy talk okay so in terms of the the time period look I'm Morales Jones at an airport stalked Bernie Sanders for about 20 minutes okay you made your point Alex but as usual you're unhinged and then we start to worry about its security because you won't leave him alone somebody who stalked me at politican and it was a bounds of reason waiting for hours and hours what are you gonna do why you know so if you're following Mitch McConnell or Elizabeth Warren I mean you always kind of think show on the other foot right if you sense something Elizabeth Warren at an airport I got no problems with that you follow her around for 15 minutes that's an issue okay it that's my take on it and I know that this sometimes it could be a little bit of a vague line but we got to keep things under control and cannot let them be physical on the other hand real quick and I've said this before the reason we're having this situation is because of money in politics and you ain't thinking like what are you talking about Mitch McConnell will not talk to Issa in his home state of Kentucky you will not talk to any constituent from Kentucky unless they have a big fat check form and so when you create a situation where you cannot reach your own representatives unless you're willing to bribe them well at some point the dams gonna burst and you're going to be having some nice Cuban food a woman and a guy and two separate occasions are gonna come up and yell at you because you've left them no recourse and that is particular to politicians yeah here's why I think this is a really tough issue I just want to give people who might not know some more information on Mitch McConnell so they understand because that anger even though it might look at face value irrational almost is actually I think perfectly rational because Mitch McConnell is a guy who for example he was for a constitutional ban on gay marriage he supported every outsourcing deal including NAFTA and GATT he voted no on bringing cheaper drugs into this country he supported repealing Obamacare cutting Social Security Medicare Medicaid he voted YES on warrantless NSA spying with the Patriot Act he supports Guantanamo Bay and torture he voted to eliminate the estate tax so he supported the Iraq war in the Afghanistan war and but here's my ultimate conclusion and why this will always be a tough issue for me is that to look at the two most extreme examples that I could come up with so if I see somebody yelling at Dick Cheney in an airport screaming about the Iraq war the fact he has blood on his hands and he ordered torture and all that stuff yes part of me is gonna go go get him absolutely such a terrible guy but then again we have to argue based on principles as well and if I saw somebody who is yelling at Bernie Sanders in an airport I'd be like oh why are you doing that so I just you know I'm just I think I'm always gonna wobble on this issue I think it's a tough issue yeah well I think everybody agrees that it's a tough issue well of course some see the world is completely black and white on on both sides but so I want to talk about the earlier woman and so that one person recorded the the second guy that you all just saw there and and there were clearly the most honest person in the room because they said i'ma sell this to TMZ you saw the giant TMZ sign on the video so apparently delivered on that promise okay but Todd Berta and Casey leaked they're partners and and they were at the diner as well it's just great to see a married couple in Kentucky it's that a to guys and and like I know that's Mitch McConnell and then but they were a little I got the sense from a don't put too many words in there a little disconcerted at the at the volume right which was the COS point if you're losing the gay couple next door with your screaming then you got to calibrate to see if that's the right way to approach the issue although your anger is incredibly justifiable based on the list that that Kyle read and that list could go on and on oh yeah anyway the first woman was also screaming apparently at the top of her lungs and I like what she said though she said you're a traitor to this country he said to Mitch McConnell and over and over told him how he was ruining the country and then after she left she went up to the window and gave him a double middle finger now and then the next guy again when a little out of bounds to say the least on the bang of the fist on the table etc and and in that video it looks like the crowd is mainly telling him not to do it according to witnesses it was mixed some were saying hey cut that out and some were saying were applauding when both of them yelled at Mitch McConnell so another interesting note and that is that they're bringing a loose Kentucky that is an interesting point one other thing that I just want to bring up and quickly mention I hate when people start to nitpick political activism and more importantly protest right because the whole point of protest is not meant to be based on the framing or the terms of the person who's being protested protests are not meant to be convenient by definition protests are supposed to make these politicians or elected officials feel uncomfortable and so once and again look I think that there are some ground rules that do make sense you don't want to get physical you don't want to do anything that could be considered assault I agree with you on the stalking thing although I think 15 minutes isn't really that long but I don't want to start nitpicking people who have been so frustrated at a political system that hasn't worked for them and elected officials who haven't looked out for them I don't want to nitpick them and tell them they're wrong when they finally get an opportunity to voice their concerns yeah look the First Amendment is meant to protect offensive speech you don't have to bother protecting perfectly Pleasant speech no one's against that and it's actually a point the right makes often when they want to say things that are racist bigoted etc and they say Hawaii that's what the First Amendment protects yeah okay that's fair but the First Amendment clearly protects this as well I mean he protects it in two parts not just in freedom of speech but also being able to seek a redress of your grievances from the government that's the Senate Majority Leader it doesn't get any more government than Mitch McConnell by the way his dining partner his wife is Elaine Chao the transportation secretary so you could not find a more government table in the whole country than that table if you wanted to get a you know to cite your grievances and that is what they did and in a sense that's the most constitutional thing you could possibly do yeah democracy is messy and that's democracy we just saw democracy yeah so unless super lest this look whatever you think of the bounds and the rules that we just stated and whether you agree or disagree with them one thing I think we can agree to is that the right wing talking point that when they say racist stuff it's awesome free speech but when the left wing says something it's a mob is absolutely preposterous correct yeah all right we gotta take a quick break so let's do that and then when we come back tax cuts yes Trump's so-called middle-class tax cuts or something yeah I got a lot of those for you guys when we come back fun numbers we hope you're enjoying this free clip from The Young Turks if you want to get the whole show and more exclusive content while supporting independent media become a member at TYT DICOM slash join today in the meantime enjoy this free site alright back on The Young Turks there's a lot of great comments here I'm gonna try to do them as quickly as I can I'm gonna go one from Twitter first dr. pepper Oh doom writes the Saudi government had dismembered rush limbaugh for example I guarantee Pat Robertson and the rest of the right-wing would be singing a different tune no I I actually I think that's a great point because they don't know khashoggi the guys at the Washington Post on khashoggi and even their conservative head of their editorial board is like well animated about this incredibly animated for understandable reasons and they know him right and a lot of that elite new Khashoggi and that's part of the reason why such a big story but Pat Robertson Rush Limbaugh those guys don't know but if they killed and dismembered Rush Limbaugh would we all have a different reaction I mean certainly the right wing would right and by the way like just to be 100% upfront about how I personally would react to that happening to Rush Limbaugh I hate Rush Limbaugh but I would be I would have the exact same reaction that I'm having right now with Khashoggi because you you cannot warrant that type of abuse of power that type of criminality that type of murder period yeah no of course and my point is though unfortunately the more famous the person is the bigger ideality yeah right you kill any kid in Yemen it doesn't matter at all that's right you can say there's a Genet a literal genocide going on in Yemen and there's barely a peep about it happening and in a journalist so that outrage so I looked into that because I was curious why it is that people latch on to the death of one person versus mass genocide things like that and there's actually a psychological phrase for it and there's a body of research that looks into it's called psychic numbing talked about it on no filter you should check it out but yeah psychic numbing is basically your brain can't really wrap itself around the sheer numbers in a genocide but it's different when it comes to one specific person but and so in this case is one specific person is somebody that did some other aleinu but the more famous you get the more outrageous it appears if they chopped up Anderson Cooper and I feel bad using any of these specific examples but if they done to Anderson Cooper we we we might go to war with Saudi Arabia right cuz oh wait a minute I know Anderson Cooper that's outrageous alright so anyway a lot more common so I'm gonna try to do this as quickly as I can Joanne 1960 says we've been brainwashed to treat politician with kid gloves and the only way we're allowed to voice our opinion is on election day it's wrong these people have our lives in their hands they have no business acting like they're in a bubble of protection now I'm going to Justin remember when we were all confused when I NIC E Haley resigned quote out of nowhere days after khashoggi was killed but just before the story broke no such thing as coincidences mmm that's a good point I I don't know so is the they think that she cares deeply about that no she just might not want to be in the middle of a mess okay okay but I have Noi's cuz I was gonna say she definitely doesn't care about that doctor chaos MD says if we let the murder of a journalist stop a weapons deal with the Saudis then we allow the death of one man to get in the way day of deaths of countless men women and children in Yemen and who knows where else and Pat Robertson can't abide that this is a great point to like wait we can't let one guy's death stop all the other deaths that were sanctioning wow what a humanitarian he is and finally turkish horas rex rights in this is all the members section why isn't anyone asking the saudis to turn over cash oh geez body after all if he was accidentally killed in a fistfight there's no reason his body should have been dismembered and dissolved an asset right another great point our members are geniuses where's the body if there was an accidental fistfight the body should be intact and you guys should have it that's like well how many stories have there been so far from Saudi Arabia like four they just keep changing the story yeah man I I wish like that we can get that into the mainstream press and have people ask that question that's such a great question I have a really quick dumb question um so that acid dissolving the body is that real I thought that was my thought on Breaking Bad so it's definitely real yeah that's what I'm saying like that's where I saw it and I'm like this is just a breaking bad thing but maybe it's a no no it's either real or turns you into the Joker okay anyway y-t-dot-com /join to be one of the geniuses who comment here and that we read and add to the show TYT concise sure all right what's nice okay so president Trump is promising middle-class tax cut he did this after a rally in Nevada The Washington Post says the following after his campaign rally in this northeastern Nevada town Trump talked up the new round of tax cuts but did not go into specifics he said the cuts would be done sometime just prior I would say to November we are going to be putting in and are studying very deeply right now around the clock major tax cut for middle income people Trump said shortly before his departure back to Washington not for business at all for middle-income people this despite the fact that Congress is out of session until after the November 6th midterm elections so basically what that means is Donald Trump just you know casually was talking about oh yeah definitely gonna do another tax cut before November but there at Congress is out so that's impossible you can't do that so in other words he just made it up and he's caught red-handed but that won't change any of his rabid supporters from still saying he's right somehow even though that makes no sense Trump this is the second time he said that he was gonna do things that he can't really do without Congress things that he said he would accomplish prior to the midterm elections the other thing which we'll talk about later in the show has to do with foreign aid to Honduras and Guatemala he says he's gonna cut off aid to those countries because of this whole caravan situation caravan of migrants trying to cross over into the United States I think especially when it comes to this tax proposal that he's randomly and casually making he realizes that the tax law that they did pass is extremely unpopular it's very clear that they were really just tax cuts for the wealthy tax cuts for corporations and the middle class hasn't really benefited from it so much so that GOP candidates have now abandoned bragging about those tax cuts while they campaign because they realize how incredibly unpopular it is so I think Trump is just trying to guard some support by saying neuro don't worry guys I got you I'm gonna cut your taxes before the midterms I don't know how he plans on doing that but one other thing that I do want to mention is if you look at polling the majority of Americans including a slight majority with Republicans would agree to increasing their taxes to get universal health care yeah so I think he's wrong in thinking that all Americans really want is more tax cuts so I have a really interesting fact about that apparently sixty-one percent of Americans say that his tax bill was for the rich and corporations so honestly it doesn't matter they've been trying to brand this from day one and they keep pounding the pavement and saying oh no this is a tax cut for regular people this isn't a tax cut for the rich it's not working even though they're repeating it over and over and over over is not working and in fact the tax bill had already passed it raises taxes on everybody that makes $75,000 a year or less over a decade so it's not working because we see what's happening wages are falling unemployment is going down so he likes to tout that over and over let go unemployment slow but wages are falling too so talking about unemployment is not the best economic indicator so many things say first on that poll there's two other fun facts about it so the margin what was the margin okay 61% well but what percentage thought no it's also for the middle class only 30 so it's 61 to 30 that's a two-to-one margin that's an absolute disaster but wait I made it fake news who did the poll was one of those media organizations it was a Republican National Committee okay that is why all the Republicans stopped running ads on the tax breaks because they were killing themselves so they were the memo went out to all Republicans stopped ads on the tax cuts because all it's doing is costing you the election it's deeply unpopular now let's go to point number 2 which is Donald Trump being such a knucklehead number one is calm pointed out Congress is not a session what he's suggesting is an impossibility and normally takes seven weeks it took seven weeks last time to pass a bill there's only 11 days left in November there's only two weeks left before the election obviously impossible okay but number two look at what do you it he said this time not for business at all for middle-income people there by admitting last time it was for business not for middle-income okay I'm glad he's stupid because it helps our cause because he accidentally reveals who he is I mean when I asked our Carlson about his pathological lies during our debate in political on last night dr. Carlson said basically well he is who he is that means basically he's not that bright and he doesn't know that he's not supposed to say last time it was for businesses and and of course the implicit part of that is the businesses that help me okay and ER he's raised over 100 million dollars already for his non-existent 20/20 election okay all from those same business interests the middle class was just an afterthought for them so I got numbers on how bad it is in a second did you want to say something yeah I just wanted to make a quick comment before Tucker made that point about Trump lying he did laugh maniacally which was very convincing you know it made a really great point there and let me also say real quick I actually would support middle-class tax cuts but the reality is they don't want middle-class tax cuts they saves middle-class tax cuts and then they cut it for the rich and to give a few examples of that in the original bill the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent and they raised the line for the estate tax up to ten million dollars so it was only applying to like you know the point oh one percent and they said why not make that the point oh oh oh one percent mm-hmm yeah that and then my favorite was in what I think it was Kevin Brady but it might have been another Republican politician who said no no the estate tax is not necessarily for the rich people of estates over five million dollars that's why they call it the death tax because they're trying to spin the PR machine to get people to think oh my god it's gonna affect me cuz I'm gonna die I don't know if it's just like a as usual a brazen lie or if they really think like oh why do five million dollars in my club is middle-class right yeah so now let me give you numbers on how much people save okay so in tax cut 1.0 the one that already passed if you're in the not 1% and there's different numbers for that 730,000 a year or 837 thousand year in that ballpark you're gonna say 60 $1,090 okay if if and then they the in 2027 what little or 2025 an realistically what little tax cuts the middle class did get get wiped out yep but for the rich permanent 75% get to keep their tax cuts forever so now wait you say for budgetary reasons they say we had two sons they call it sunsetting wait the sunset the tax cuts for the middle class well then why didn't you have to sunset the taxes for the rich I mean that causes even more money oh but no those are our donors and our friendly of course we're not gonna end those so now they're coming back around and saying well yeah I mean yeah sure we meant the middle class too right now that it's unpopular about we're about to lose the election we also meant the middle class okay so a great analysis to find out okay tax cuts 2.0 this is already passed by the house okay so Senate's not gonna come back and pass it the Republicans in the House all voted for this we're almost all dead if you make under twenty eight thousand six hundred dollars so you know Porter middle class you're gonna get about 100 bucks so it's in the middle-class tax cuts you would actually get $100 if you make it under that I'm $1 for the full year for the whole year 101 okay all right and it's actually worse than that because I remember there was a great article on the intercept right after Trump was elected in his first week in office he got rid of a middle-class mortgage tax deduction which effectively raised taxes on the middle class so they never meant it about you ever ever ever ever ever don't let them get away with the lies and by the way this is why the media's the mainstream media is so objectively terrible and why you have to come to new media to get the truth because they won't tell you that they'll say they'll give you the both sides tap-dance and they'll say well you know the Republicans say they're cutting it for the middle class but they're not actually doing that so you know report do your job and here look I'll give you the the real numbers in the new tax cuts luckily again they have not been passed and we might listen agree a little bit whether I'm in favor of a tax cut for the middle class if you make between fifty four thousand and ninety five thousand dollars in in the ones that are proposed you would actually get a nine hundred and eighty dollar tax cut now I'm opposed to that because I think it's basically just bribery of the of real Americans they say they're giving away stuff it's Christmas right and this is what they accuse Democrats of all the time Obama phones and he's giving away stuff to minorities this is a giveaway in another sort it's just a - but it destroys the deficit etc that's my conservative fiscal side from from back in the day but 980 dollars to be fair okay the top one percent would get another forty thousand one hundred and eighty dollars on top of the sixty one thousand dollars that's right getting with tax cut 1.0 so at the end of the day if you're poor to middle-class you get about a hundred bucks combined from the two you get about thousand bucks if you're middle-class and if you're rich you get a hundred thousand dollars okay and then Trump says or the new ones for the middle class now why are you giving forty thousand the Muslims not one percent again in that proposal so even that's not true they can't help themselves they love redistribution of wealth they love to take it from you and give it to the top one percent okay we got to take another break and when we come back my summary of the different debating styles of substance of the four people I've debated in the last four years of political and culture events fear of Dinesh D'Souza and Tucker Carlson and then how I responded to them so it's an interesting conversation we'll do that when we return
