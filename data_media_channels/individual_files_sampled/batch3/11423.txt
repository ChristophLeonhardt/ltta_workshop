for the members that just came in we're at ease for the fall of the gavel so everybody presently in the room except senator sass and tell us has spoken there's still time between now and the time we scheduled voted senator sass or senator Tillis wants to say anything then we we continue to stand at ease mr. chairman given what's happening in the anteroom I think if some more time is needed I think you'd get a unanimous consent to push the road back pretty easily if you needed a few more minutes I'm we made a decision of order 130 if there's some reason to change that then we'll have to change it but I'm not even going getting a discussion about that right now fair enough gotta get I recess the meeting until the fall of the gavel we're going to take action with a motion that's before us we got to make sure that we have a quorum as a as a point of personal privilege I'm going to call on senator flake to speak normally we would start to vote right now but it's a point of personal privilege I would call on senator flake oh thank you I've been speaking with a number of people on the other side we've had conversations ongoing for a while with regard to making sure that we do due diligence here and I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week in order to let the FBI continue to do an investigation limited in time and scope to the current allegations that are there and limit in time to no more than one week and I will vote to advance the bill to the floor with that understanding and I've spoken to a few other members who on my side of the aisle that may be supportive as well but that's my position I I think that that we we ought to do what we can to make sure that that we do all due diligence with a nomination this important and I want to say that this committee has acted properly and the chairman has been over backwards to do investigations from this committee and to delay this vote in this committee for a week so that judge or that that board dr. Ford could be heard and she was yesterday so so that's with that agreement I will vote to a dance bill to the floor torkoal just wait just one second ken ken Diane when are we voting on that see we are voting on the motion to report the nomination to the floor the clerk will call the roll wait that's not my understanding of what mr. chairman let's the senator explain it he adequate that is my my my understanding and if the Democrats could speak to it of Chris or you was talked about before that the Democrats would accept and endorse a one-week a FBI investigation limited in time and scope so ensure the deciding since you're the deciding vote here will vote and then if there's any sort of discussion we'll go do that after the vote call the roll no the nominee no the nominee will be reported to the mr. chairman may I be recognized yes Thank You mr. chairman I just want to thank my friend and colleague senator flake and thank you for giving us the time today to have a conversation a number of my colleagues have asked for a one-week delay in order that there might be an FBI investigation of what allegations are currently before this committee I respect senator flakes view that in his opinion it was best to respect your having given dr. Ford the time to be heard yesterday and advance the nominee to the floor but it is my hope that we could work together on a bipartisan basis to diligently pursue an FBI investigation within the next week not for the purpose of delay but for the purpose of investigating further either allegations made by dr. Ford or others with a goal towards demonstrating a bipartisan commitment to diligently investigating these allegations Thank You mr. chairman Thank You senator flake senator Feinstein thank you I would support that motion I think we do need this investigation matter of fact I sort of misunderstood senator flake what you were doing I thought it included a one-week investigation so I would like to support the motion for that investigation miss chairman is chairman we'll take turns here I love this committee but we're not the majority leader senator flake has made clear what it would take him to be comfortable on a final passage vote but it doesn't matter what we say here this will be up to Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell so it is completely up to them yeah and I think I just made himself very clear and smooth for me that Senator Leahy fairly well mr. Chairman I want to make sure because this is someone on precedent when I do agree with a senator from Arizona that we should have this further investigation so my understanding is during the week that that is taking place there will be no action on the floor of the United States Senate on on this nomination that correct that cannot I cannot say that let me say again I'm not making I can't make that commitment for the the leadership I can only say that I would be only comfortable moving forward on the floor I'll move it out of committee but I will only be comfortable moving on the floor until the FBI has done more investigation than they have already it may not take them a week I understand that some of these witnesses may not want to discuss anything further but I think we're we owe them due diligence your chairman just a minute all I have said to Senator flake is that I would advocate for the position he took but I don't control that senator mr. chairman yes sir senator Klobuchar mr. chairman there are other senators as well who may be interested in this negotiation on the Republican side and there's not really a set agreement here all of us had already said we were voting now it is simply a center flake working with all of us to say for the good of the Senate and the good of the court the American people deserve to have the facts followed up on and I really appreciate his willingness to do that and that is what this is about this is simply about and by the way if Senator McConnell wants to go forward in light of that and we still have several senators that haven't said how they're voting on this nominee I actually think this is very important what just happened right now so it doesn't have to have an agreement it is one senator who's standing up senator Cornyn mr. chairman I just want to express my appreciation to Senator flake for allowing in this process to move forward there's some difference of opinion among us as to what exactly the FBI investigation would consist of some of us think the it has been concluded and supplemented by of this committees investigation others disagree with that but I respect the fact that not only senator flake advocated to give dr. Ford chance to appear in front of the committee which was the right thing to do but also that he's allowed this process to move forward subject to further discussions about what the FBI may or may not be able to come up with but certainly he maintains his right to cast his vote yea or nay as he sees fit and maintains significant leverage that way but I appreciate his his support for a full and fair hearing for dr. Ford and judge Cavanaugh as well as his willingness to allow this to go forward subject to his his request mr. chairman if I threw the chair could ask a question of senator flake does your Amendment include continuing the investigation during this period of time if I can respond there is no amendment I'm simply stating and the discussion that we had between us all is that I would hope and I think we had some agreement before that the Democrats who have been I think justifiably uncomfortable moving ahead could could publicly in an effort to bring this country together say that we would feel better I'm not expecting them to vote yes but not to complain that an FBI investigation has not occurred and and I that's what I'm trying to do who this country's being ripped apart here and and we've got to make sure that we do deal with due diligence I think this committee has done a good job but I do think that we can have a short pause and and make sure that the FBI can investigate my understanding is that some of us would have to and I'm prepared to do it make a request to the White House to ask the FBI to do that investigation it would be short and limited in scope to the current allegations that have been made mr. chairman I I would just encourage Democrats who we'd talked to before to endorse that kind of thing that that we can then move on mr. chairman because of the to our rule we're adjourned what yeah we did the other tool our rules we knew we had to get this all done well is it done it's flakes argue is it gonna happen or do you cut off a vote no we didn't have a notion and for us this is all a gentleman and women's agreement that was several men and women everywhere but I'm committed you're 11 single he's committed to hey John
