1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,280
THE CHOLERA
OUTBREAK IN YEMEN WE REPORTED ON

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,910
EARLIER THIS YEAR IS NOW BEING
CALLED THE LARGEST EVER RECORDED

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,440
IN ANY COUNTRY IN A SINGLE YEAR,
WHICH IS NOT THE WAY DISEASES

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,018
ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK IN THE
MODERN ERA.

5
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:17,560
THERE ARE NOW 5000

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,000
NEW CASES JUST WITHIN YEMEN
EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND SO FAR THE

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,240
DEATH TOLL IS ALREADY OVER 1000,
A QUARTER OF WHICH IS CHILDREN.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,680
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A CIVIL WAR
GOING ON THERE, AND BECAUSE OF

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,160
THAT YEMEN'S INFRASTRUCTURE, IN
ALL SENSES BUT MEDICALLY AS

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,410
WELL, HAS BEEN LARGELY
DESTROYED, MOSTLY DUE TO THE

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,780
U.S.-BACKED SAUDI AIRSTRIKES.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,830
IT'S BELIEVED THAT IT WILL GET

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,780
WORSE ONCE YEMEN ENTERS ITS
RAINY SEASON LATER ON THIS YEAR,

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,379
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY TRAGIC NEWS AND
ONLY GETTING WORSE.

15
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:52,379
BACK HERE IN

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,809
AMERICA WE HAD MADE IN AMERICA
WEEK, WE HAVE A LITTLE IRONY FOR

17
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:56,809
YOU.

18
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,790
NOT ONLY DURING THAT WEEK
DID TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,840
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE THEIR
PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF AMERICA, BUT

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,060
MAR-A-LAGO APPLIED FOR 70 NEW
FOREIGN WORKER VISAS.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,060
GRANTED

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,969
THEY WILL BE MAKING BIG,
BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN CAKES, BUT

23
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:18,039
THEY WILL BE FOREIGNERS.

24
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,399
YOU CAN'T FIND AMERICANS TO DO
THOSE JOBS.

25
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:27,189
THAT IS SKILLED,

26
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,639
TECHNICAL WORK YOU CAN ONLY FIND
A BROAD.

27
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:33,429
THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT
IRONY MADE IN AMERICA WEEK.

28
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,829
I'M DUMBFOUNDED, I THINK IT'S
A FAILURE OF POLITICS BECAUSE

29
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:43,130
I'LL THINK I MET MY CORE WRONG,
AT ITS CORE THERE WAS AN

30
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,569
EFFECTIVE ANTI-TRUMP STRATEGY
ABOUT MAKING ALL OF HIS PRODUCTS

31
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:49,099
ABROAD.

32
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,859
AND IT FAILED, IT WAS
NEVER ATTEMPTED CORRECTLY, IT

33
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:53,859
WAS NOT STUCK TO.

34
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,229
IT WAS LATE-NIGHT HOSTS THAT
DID MOST OF IT.

35
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,880
MAYBE THE GUY WAS IMPERVIOUS
TO ANY DENT IN THE ARMOR --

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,539
THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT
WAS THE CASE -- BUT I STILL FELT

37
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,179
LIKE THIS WAS A BASE LEVEL --
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT

38
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,489
AMERICANS WERE LIKE, YOU'RE
KIDDING ME, YOU DON'T MAKE YOUR

39
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,489
STUFF HERE.

40
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:17,760
WE WENT AFTER THE
WRONG THINGS.

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,480
THE HYPOCRISY OF TRUMP IS ON
DISPLAY IN A LOT OF WAYS, BUT

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,730
IT'S RIGHT THERE ON EVERY TAG IN
A WAY THAT'S DEMONSTRABLE.

43
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,730
BUT I

44
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,940
THINK IN A WAY HE WAS
BULLETPROOF.

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,940
AND DURING THE

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,920
CAMPAIGN, I KNOW WE ALWAYS REFER
TO THE CAMPAIGN A LOT, BUT IT

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,780
WAS SORT OF AN IMPORTANT
CAMPAIGN -- HILLARY WAS ANYTHING

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,920
BUT BULLETPROOF.

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,310
I HEARD SHE PRODUCED MOST OF
HER TRUMP PRODUCTS OVERSEAS.

50
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,310
I

51
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,900
DON'T THINK SHE GOT ENOUGH
CRITICISM FOR THAT.

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,900
THAT'S OF

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,900
COURSE WHY WE ARE MENTIONING
THIS.

54
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
IN CASE ANY TRUMP VIEWERS

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,219
ARE WATCHING THIS, YOU KNOW HE'S
NOT ON YOUR SIDE, RIGHT?

56
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,219
FINALLY

57
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,611
EARLIER THIS WEEK DURING THE
HEALTHCARE FALLOUT FROM IT

58
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:02,670
FALLING APART AND DONALD TRUMP
WANTING TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK,

59
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,569
HE HAD A MEETING RECALLED ON THE
SENATE TO TAKE AWAY THE RECESS

60
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:10,120
IN AUGUST AND NOT REST UNTIL
THEY PASSED A HEALTHCARE BILL.

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,890
AT THAT TIME BOTH JAYAR JACKSON
AND I PREDICTED THAT THAT WILL

62
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:18,790
PROBABLY BE A DO AS I SAY NOT AS
I DO THING, AND THERE'S EVIDENCE

63
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,790
THAT IS THE CASE.

64
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,400
THE FAA ISSUED
FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS AROUND THE

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,060
TRUMP PROPERTY IN NEW JERSEY FOR
AUGUST 3 TO AUGUST 20, WHICH IT

66
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,200
GENERALLY DOES WHEN DONALD TRUMP
IS OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE

67
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
AND STAYING SOMEWHERE ELSE.

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,469
IT
LOOKS LIKE HE WILL SPEND ABOUT

69
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:36,310
THREE WEEKS PLAYING GOLF IN NEW
JERSEY, WHICH IS OF COURSE AS WE

70
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,439
KNOW THE BEST WAY TO PASS
HEALTHCARE BILLS.

71
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,799
CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING TO A NEW
JERSEY GOLF RESORT FOR 17 DAYS

72
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,019
WHEN YOU COULD GO ANYWHERE IN
THE WORLD?

73
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:48,749
CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING TO A NEW
JERSEY GOLF RESORT FOR 17 DAYS

74
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,639
AND YOUR GOLF GAME BEING STILL
SO BAD THAT YOU NEED TO OPENLY

75
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,319
CHEAT?

76
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,439
I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE IN
THAT CIRCLE, THESE CEOS WHO PLAY

77
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,670
GOLF WITH HIM -- HE IS A
NOTORIOUS CHEATER, EVERYONE

78
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,610
TALKS ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

79
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,610
WE

80
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,849
WILL HEAR LATER ON IN THE SHOW
ABOUT HOW GOOD AT SPORTS HE IS.

81
00:04:08,849 --> 00:00:00,000
HE'S GREAT AT SPORTS.
