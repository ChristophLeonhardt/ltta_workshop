using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up there like always keen my</font>

22
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,300
shoes at that time especially around

23
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,579
2008 was such a big thing everyone was

24
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,170
just doing all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it there a</font>

25
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,789
lot actually can I remember Haley doing

26
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,140
them a bunch of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well especially</font>

27
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,390
through blog TV and I did a fair for you

28
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,980
but then for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason live shows</font>

29
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,570
became kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson that's common I</font>

30
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,129
got approached<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a lot of companies who</font>

31
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,079
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with me like big life and</font>

32
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,000
you now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff the kind of game of</font>

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,859
fighting them and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you now</font>

34
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,570
is where you like kick people off as

35
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,910
well and self is it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird I like</font>

36
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,010
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go to show and knowing</font>

37
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the post i want to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

38
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,790
be that but it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> works for some</font>

39
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,920
people that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just X on out if you</font>

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't like them the same thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

of motivates ratings web sites and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

42
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,880
sort of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> your judgment matters and</font>

43
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of motivated by that which</font>

44
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,360
anything is necessarily the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,850
framework for having a live show but

46
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,009
then the live shows that you know I want

47
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch or ones that</font>

48
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,700
involve a lot of talking and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

49
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,189
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like where are a big like speaking</font>

50
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,810
me respond visibly to have all these

51
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,939
companies like approaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> me thinking</font>

52
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I just wanted loads of numbers we</font>

53
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,710
did go into a phase where they'd realize

54
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,649
people had stopped largely doing live

55
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,210
shows and they thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they could</font>

56
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,159
fill this gap with with that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">meantime you get all these things like</font>

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,540
be used on dailybooth imitate that live

59
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,729
sense especially the youth or you can be

60
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,470
typing question in and a pre-prepared

61
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,689
arts will already pop up and it's as

62
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,600
though that creator is talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

63
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,159
and response to your question it's very

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,380
like simulated individual connection

65
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,020
always had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very limited lifespan like</font>

66
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,848
that's not something that people want in

67
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,169
any sustained way especially after

68
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,819
they've gone through all the answers and

69
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,249
like there's a limit to them there's

70
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:17,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's exhaustible the formspring also</font>

71
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,870
really big for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little while and then</font>

72
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,030
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of went out the picture already</font>

73
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,769
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> imac waiting for spring which is</font>

74
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,930
like this question service with a live

75
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,819
show now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all a lot more</font>

76
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved of twitter and tumblr and stuff</font>

77
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,950
so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain lightness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

78
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">but not in the same way as like everyone</font>

79
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,430
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coming together in a community</font>

80
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,650
fashion and i did a hangout last month

81
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,719
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i enjoyed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lot I just don't have</font>

82
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,419
that our to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a portion to doing a live</font>

83
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,639
show or then when I do but time we get

84
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,889
there like I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have</font>

85
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,989
enough to give I think it's a lot to do

86
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:49,799
with the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

87
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">person talking collaborative live shows</font>

88
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,519
and hang out some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,109
so popular because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to have</font>

90
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,079
multiple voices and that not only tastes

91
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,310
of pressure off it also adds a really

92
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,290
great dynamic into it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

93
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,389
you're like what the future that is but

94
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,340
i do think like I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

95
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,900
that hangouts are actually really clever

96
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,090
in their collaborative aspect I decide

97
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,620
about this was quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and the fact</font>

98
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can broadcast on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

99
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">channel as well it's very open broad and</font>

100
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,449
I like that about it but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font>

101
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm looking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've said like all</font>

102
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,079
these companies often approached me and

103
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,000
one company<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richmond called ok hello in</font>

104
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,139
which you won't have been seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

105
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,720
tweet about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they put a couple of</font>

106
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,459
other people's where I like care if it

107
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,739
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like an iPhone app</font>

108
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,930
actually let me find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but first let me</font>

109
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,810
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you my background yeah that's great</font>

110
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,709
I case we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok la which is there</font>

111
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like an iphone app which is</font>

112
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like I message but it has a</font>

113
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,849
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge of interface and the cool</font>

114
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:42,810
thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that you can do</font>

115
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,729
spontaneous group video chats and stuff

116
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,099
but a feature that Mary and I have been

117
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,720
enjoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot is sending each other on</font>

118
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,430
locations you can like send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little map</font>

119
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,739
with your location to you can text it to

120
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,479
someone in the same message streamers

121
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,099
you have your group video chat and your

122
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,500
pictures and your texts and whatever so

123
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,969
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been sending you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on locations</font>

124
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,819
which is like in our rooms just<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font>

125
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,829
forth so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in the same place of</font>

126
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,659
some reason we really enjoy it but what

127
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see is like the next step for live</font>

128
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,069
shows and like I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> holding it stuff</font>

129
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,930
like this like fan interaction because

130
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,549
we interact a lot you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I because well</font>

131
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:15,750
I think this isn't the case there are

132
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,978
some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have said well people just</font>

133
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,298
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the sustained attention to</font>

134
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,620
sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and watch a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-hour live show</font>

135
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,298
anymore but I also do think that a lot

136
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,279
of YouTube is now at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least during a big</font>

137
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,229
time crunch because we're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font>

138
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:25,470
more

139
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,030
more like ambitious with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope of</font>

140
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,040
what we do that everyday life and we

141
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,690
also simultaneously have all these other

142
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,700
opportunities as well being presented to

143
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,870
us I don't know that I would say that

144
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,880
things like okay hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> or like a direct</font>

145
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,130
alternative live shows but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

146
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a fun other option that we can</font>

147
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,670
explore and I don't know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it'd be</font>

148
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,710
really fun if we did so yeah you can't

149
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,690
feel now if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you don't</font>

150
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,340
