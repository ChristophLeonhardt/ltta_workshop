it doesn't make sense to lie to kids about money you know they will find out they will find out from friends they will find out online and also I think it's really important to not lie at the moment it's an instinctual thing for parents if they I don't have my wallet on me or I don't have my money with me and then the next second you're using your phone to buy it you know cafe au lait and your kids seasons are like what so you want to make sure to be honest and if they say re rich it's like well let's think about you know what that means we have so much we have a home we have each other we have a family and especially with younger kids that's kind of what they're asking to begin with and making giving kids context is so important
