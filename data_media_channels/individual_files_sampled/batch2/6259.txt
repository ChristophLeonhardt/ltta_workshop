alex jones for seven days one week following the discovery of a video that he had tweeted where he was inciting violence now he has been banned from various social media platforms and the reason why he was banned in my opinion has to do with the fact that he is inciting violence that's something that no one should be allowed to do I don't care you know whether or not your free speech activist or not free speech does not protect inciting violence and even in this case we're not talking about the federal government of course we're talking about private companies but even in a federal government situation the government does not protect this kind of speech the Constitution does not protect this kind of speech but anyway people don't understand that drives me crazy so with that said you can tell I'm bitter about this right because the arguments are so incredibly ignorant drives me nuts so finally Twitter decides ok here's a video of him inciting violence we got to do something about it so let's go ahead and suspend him for seven days we'll have a discussion about whether or not that makes sense but I want you guys to judge for yourselves by watching the video that Alex Jones had tweeted take a look it now stands with you and the US military so I know already understand who the cha-cha my operatives and the traitors are to understand who's trying to take the First Amendment we're under attack and you know that you've pointed out mainstream media as the enemy but now it's time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag I know the Justice Department's crippled a bunch of followers and cowards but there's there's groups there's grand juries there's you call foreign it's time politically and economically and and and judiciously and legally and criminally to move against these people it's got to be done now and let's go let's do it because they're coming America needs to know that they've got their little pathetic commie red team's ready and they've got their it's picked out the sheriff's the judges the police chiefs the Patriots the veterans the talk show hosts everybody and everybody's gonna be amazed when they come when those cowards come and it's gonna hit in the middle of a night and they're coming and they're coming and they're coming they think they can really take down America this is it so people need to have their battle rifles everything ready they're bedsides and you got to be ready okay so here are the problematic parts of that insane rant now is the time to act on the mainstream media and he says get the battle rifles ready okay that incites violence if you want to have a discussion or a monologue where you're critical of the mainstream media have at it you of course you're able to do that and I would support it even if I disagree with what you're saying you are not allowed to incite violence against anyone including the mainstream press you're just not it that is not protected speech based on what our Constitution says and when it comes to private companies if they're concerned about that kind of speech they have the ability to do whatever they want and whether it's suspend you or block you he hasn't I mean the thing is he hasn't learned anything and the thing that Facebook did wrong was their lame excuse or they're lame reasoning for blocking him know don't block people for hate speech right I mean people disagree with me on that some people think you should be blocked for hate speech I don't think that's the case I don't agree with that but I certainly do not agree with inciting violence and having direct targets and encouraging your listeners and your viewers to go after those targets that's insane but people think like oh no but I like to talk about conspiracy theories on my show too so are they gonna block me I mean people are worried about themselves how about don't incite violence and you have nothing to worry about it's just so pathetic man because here's the thing we're not interested in protecting Americans we're not worried about people's safety we're not worried about you know parents who lost their six-year-old in the Sandy Hook shooting getting harassed and targeted and doxed by numerous people who watch Alex Jones and believe his conspiracy theories we're not worried about protecting them right yeah woman went to prison for five months because of what she was doing to that family right we don't care about them we care about Alex Jones but here's the thing we don't even care about Alex Jones everyone's worried about their own ass like oh my god what if I get censored well if you're not doing anything wrong I will fight as aggressively as I need to to make sure you don't get banned but someone like Alex Jones he deserves to be banned because he incites violence that is not protected speech and I wish Facebook and all the other platforms were clear about that because saying that you're getting rid of someone for hate speech is not the right way to go about it but the concern was being misunderstood and crazy fans going I can't believe you stopped my my messiahs free speech to say insane things and try to get people murdered but I guarantee if the parents of one of those kids that was killed in Sandy Hook threatened this guy they would be they did be suspended they probably arrested and probably doing time for the same things that he's inciting others to do so he sends his minions out to do things I mean comet Pizza wasn't it yeah that guy goes to jail but who's still on the air talking this guy this is how it works you can send off your your your soldiers to do your work and go to jail and then continue on and even use those instances of them going to jail but like you see the groups are coming to get you how many times did he draw and get you not coming and they're coming like it sounds like a cartoon but people who read into that are their fear is rising and then when people get afraid especially in this country with the number of guns and weapons that we told we have to use because it's a birthright to go shoot someone in the face they go isn't this isn't just a turn of our country's freedom we're supposed to go kill kids in a video accusing Robert Muller of having sex with children and running a sex ring how is that okay how is it okay to do that that would be under them that would fall under the Free Speech Saturday but it does not fall under free speech if you state that as a fact if you say I think Robert Muller doing XY and Z that is protected because you're saying it's your opinion you sure he reports it as if it's fact right and so look Robert molars got all the protection in the world he's gonna be fine but when you go after the private citizens who are now unfortunately in the public eye because they lost their kids in a mass shooting they don't have those resources they can't protect themselves that's where the issue is the heinous nough sub alex jones really is all in the Sandy Hook thing you don't really need to go much beyond it you can go beyond it and we have and we've detailed and I'm sure that will detail more but the idea that Sandy Hook the horror of Sandy Hook which should have provoked legislation on guns which certainly brought us all to great sympathies to that family to those families involved the fact that that could be exploited for some crap about how there were crisis actors and it was all phony I mean it's just it's heinous that's the only word that comes to mind it's obscene and I personally believe that we sanitize these stories with all these these shootings these mass shootings and that's a great one that I can use as an example you see the yellow tape but you don't see the horror of those elementary school kids with their brains and bodies splayed out by bullets so Alex Jones then can come on and say hey it's wasn't even real these are all crisis actors and then to the point that individuals who subscribe to Alex Jones and follow him like some messianic creature they can then do his bidding and go after these grieving families that's gusting it is disgusting so Jack Dorsey who is the CEO of Twitter I had a conversation with Lester Holt and the topic of suspension versus ban came up and here was the reasoning behind Twitter suspending Alex Jones rather than banning him you have you've taken action against him in this instance what is it can you tell us what it is we I believe we put him in a timeout removing his ability to tweet for for a time period a timeout seems seems minor compared to the implications of someone suggesting a call to arms against a particular group in this case the media how do you respond to that well I feel you know any any suspension whether it be a permanent one or a temporary one make someone think about their actions and their behaviors and changes behavior based on a timeout I don't know we we have found that it does have the potential to change impact and change behavior so whether it works with in this case to change some of those behaviors and change some of those actions I don't know it worked on the 12 year old kid that was uh that was tweeting bullying things about her friend in middle school it worked on her we found from others it works we put teenagers on timeout it really hurts them for those 7 days so they come back and they changed it to you know yeah so look whatever it's a private company they can do what they want to do so if they want to suspend him rather than ban him that's their decision but for the platforms who have made the decision to ban him come out and explain clearly why he deserves to be banned because when you say you're against hate speech that you know that leads to a fear among all sorts of people who think they're the next to be targeted and no one should be targeted for sharing their opinion on whatever it is I mean people are making hate speech videos about me right now and it's fine do you boo right I'm not I will fight for your right to put those videos up but you cannot incite violence against innocent people it is a dangerous thing to do especially in a country like the United States where we're swimming in guns
