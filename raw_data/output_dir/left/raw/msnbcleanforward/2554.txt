COULD TO MAKE SURE NOBODY BELIEVES THAT DEMOCRATS ARE OUT

166
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:53,018
BELIEVES THAT DEMOCRATS ARE OUT HERE HARASSING ANYBODY OR

167
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:53,785
HERE HARASSING ANYBODY OR CAUSING ANY VIOLENCE.

168
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,188
CAUSING ANY VIOLENCE. AND I THINK THAT SHE WAS VERY

169
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:58,791
AND I THINK THAT SHE WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY SHE SAID

170
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,026
RESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY SHE SAID THAT THEY’RE NOT ATTACKING ME.

171
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,461
THAT THEY’RE NOT ATTACKING ME. THEY’RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

172
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:03,029
THEY’RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WE’RE

173
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,630
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WE’RE FOCUSED ON THE CHILDREN AND THAT

174
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:07,133
FOCUSED ON THE CHILDREN AND THAT WE’RE NOT FOCUSED ON THIS

175
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:08,301
WE’RE NOT FOCUSED ON THIS DIVERSION, PARTICULARLY THE WAY

176
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,835
DIVERSION, PARTICULARLY THE WAY THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE IT

177
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:12,004
THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE IT SOUND AND MAKE IT OUT TO BE.

178
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,806
SOUND AND MAKE IT OUT TO BE. AND AGAIN, LET ME JUST TELL YOU

179
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:14,106
AND AGAIN, LET ME JUST TELL YOU THIS.

180
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,008
THIS. I AM FOCUSED ON THE CHILDREN.

181
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:17,543
I AM FOCUSED ON THE CHILDREN. I’VE HAD SLEEPLESS NIGHTS ABOUT

182
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:19,645
I’VE HAD SLEEPLESS NIGHTS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THESE CHILDREN DO

183
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,413
THE FACT THAT THESE CHILDREN DO NOT -- WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY

184
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:22,215
NOT -- WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

185
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:23,349
ARE. THE PARENTS DON’T KNOW WHERE

186
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:24,350
THE PARENTS DON’T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

187
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,618
THEY ARE. WHY CAN’T THE ADMINISTRATION

188
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,353
WHY CAN’T THE ADMINISTRATION COME UP WITH A PLAN TO CONNECT

189
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:29,522
COME UP WITH A PLAN TO CONNECT THEM AND MAKE IT PUBLIC SO THAT

190
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:30,957
THEM AND MAKE IT PUBLIC SO THAT WE CAN ALL GET MORE COMFORTABLE

191
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,959
WE CAN ALL GET MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT THEY ARE

192
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:34,327
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE RECONNECTED.

193
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,862
GOING TO BE RECONNECTED. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

194
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:36,663
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS

195
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,164
SEPARATED IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

196
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:42,235
DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO DO

197
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,536
THIS PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO DO EVERYTHING TO DIVERT ATTENTION.

198
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:44,737
EVERYTHING TO DIVERT ATTENTION. HE CALLS ME NAMES.

199
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,339
HE CALLS ME NAMES. HE CALLS EVERYBODY NAMES.

200
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,173
HE CALLS EVERYBODY NAMES. AS A MATTER OF FACT WE EXPECT

201
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:47,774
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE EXPECT THAT FROM HIM.

202
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:50,143
THAT FROM HIM. BUT WE EXPECT -- WE HAVE COME

203
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:52,545
BUT WE EXPECT -- WE HAVE COME TOO CLOSE TO NORMALIZING THIS

204
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:52,879
TOO CLOSE TO NORMALIZING THIS PRESIDENT.

205
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,514
PRESIDENT. LISTEN TO SOME OF HIS STATEMENTS

206
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:56,282
LISTEN TO SOME OF HIS STATEMENTS DURING HIS CAMPAIGN AND SINCE HE

207
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,718
DURING HIS CAMPAIGN AND SINCE HE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT.

208
00:05:58,761 --> 00:05:59,986
HAS BEEN PRESIDENT. HIS VIOLENCE STATEMENTS ARE, I

209
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,421
HIS VIOLENCE STATEMENTS ARE, I QUOTE, I’D LIKE TO PUNCH HIM IN

210
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:02,789
QUOTE, I’D LIKE TO PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE.

211
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,490
THE FACE. ANOTHER VIOLENT STATEMENT, KNOCK

212
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:06,059
ANOTHER VIOLENT STATEMENT, KNOCK THE CRAP OUT OF THEM.

213
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,493
THE CRAP OUT OF THEM. ANOTHER ONE, MAYBE HE SHOULD

214
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:08,995
ANOTHER ONE, MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROUGHED UP.

215
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:13,700
HAVE BEEN ROUGHED UP. AND THEN HE GOES ON TO SAY, TRY

216
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:15,635
AND THEN HE GOES ON TO SAY, TRY NOT TO HURT HIM, BUT IF YOU DO,

217
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,703
NOT TO HURT HIM, BUT IF YOU DO, I’LL DEFEND YOU IN COURT.

218
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:17,737
I’LL DEFEND YOU IN COURT. DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

219
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,172
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT. NOW, IF THAT’S NOT CREATING

220
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:21,975
NOW, IF THAT’S NOT CREATING VIOLENCE AND SUPPORTING

221
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:22,475
VIOLENCE AND SUPPORTING VIOLENCE, WHAT IS?

222
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:25,011
VIOLENCE, WHAT IS? I’VE SAID NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

223
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:27,214
I’VE SAID NOTHING ABOUT THAT. I’VE TALKED ABOUT PEACEFUL

224
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:27,581
I’VE TALKED ABOUT PEACEFUL PROTESTS.

225
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:28,615
PROTESTS. >> YOU DON’T THINK THAT’S A GOOD

226
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:28,915
>> YOU DON’T THINK THAT’S A GOOD IDEA.

227
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,216
IDEA. YOU DON’T APPROVE THE

228
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:31,017
YOU DON’T APPROVE THE PRESIDENT’S LANGUAGE THERE.

229
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:32,418
PRESIDENT’S LANGUAGE THERE. YOU WOULDN’T CALL FOR PEOPLE TO

230
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:33,820
YOU WOULDN’T CALL FOR PEOPLE TO PHYSICALLY THREATEN OR TO

231
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:35,221
PHYSICALLY THREATEN OR TO INTIMIDATE OR ATTACK ANYONE?

232
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:36,690
INTIMIDATE OR ATTACK ANYONE? I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ON

233
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:37,023
I WANT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THAT.

234
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:37,524
THAT. >> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

235
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:40,527
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. I WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY SUPPORT

236
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,329
I WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY SUPPORT ANY VIOLENCE, ANYBODY BEING HIT

237
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,931
ANY VIOLENCE, ANYBODY BEING HIT OR BEATEN OR THEN SAY TO THEM

238
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,066
OR BEATEN OR THEN SAY TO THEM I’LL HAVE TO GET YOU OUT OF

239
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,400
I’LL HAVE TO GET YOU OUT OF JAIL.

240
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:49,036
JAIL. THIS PRESIDENT IS GUILTY OF ALL

241
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:49,336
THIS PRESIDENT IS GUILTY OF ALL OF THAT.

242
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,937
OF THAT. DON’T FORGET THAT THEY CREATED

243
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:53,373
DON’T FORGET THAT THEY CREATED SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT

244
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,943
SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT PROTESTS THAT WE’VE EVER SEEN

245
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:56,944
PROTESTS THAT WE’VE EVER SEEN LED BY A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

I’M FOR THE PARENTS. I WANT THOSE CHILDREN CONNECTED

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,951
I WANT THOSE CHILDREN CONNECTED BACK TO THEIR PARENTS.
