1
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,512
We treat this place and
those objects 

2
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,581
as historical documents.

3
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:52,919
I believe it is very
important to keep this

4
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:57,957
and to let the visitors
see it and touch it.

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,568
This is the oldest part of
this camp.

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,472
And these are buildings built 
by the forced labor

7
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:18,278
of Soviet prisoners of war,
during 1941 and '42.

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,818
One of the most serious 
reasons for deterioration

9
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,254
is a very poor manufacturing
technique.

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,190
The buildings in Birkenau,

11
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,662
they were built in a very fast
way, in very bad conditions.

12
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:55,615
There is no memorial that
will give you

13
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,419
the image of the conditions
in the camp.

14
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,558
You can only see it by
seeing authentic buildings,

15
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,928
authentic space,
authentic elements.

16
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,232
And still what happened
in this place 

17
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,834
is beyond our imagination.

18
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,937
But at least the authentic
place

19
00:02:17,937 --> 00:00:00,000
can bring you closer
to this history.
