hip-hop crooner Snoop Doggy puff has a new piece out on our fearless leader it's called make America Crip again now I wanted to play this clip of the random noises and cacophony that he calls a musical piece but unfortunately there is summat so much expletive in it that we can't do it on the show yeah it'd just be a bleep it'd just be a long bleep so I can quote the lyrics Snoop Snoopy says the president wants to make America great again eff that we gonna make America crip again crip referring to the gang that I guess he was associated with now this is a marked change in hip-hop hip-hop is turning on president Trump now but hip-hop used to love Trump because he was a symbol of conspicuous wealth and success and something to aspire to so a young musician named Young Jeezy once warbled quote and I'm gonna change a couple words because I don't want to get yelled at quote richest ninja in my hood call me Donald Trump there were 318 mentions according to Nate Silver at 538 of Donald Trump between 1989 and 2016 amber why does hip-hop not like Donald Trump anymore well because he's a Republican I mean it's fairly obvious these rappers are good buddies with Barack Obama and I guess to some extent Hillary Clinton although I don't think she's quite hip enough for most of them but the part that really got me about Snoop Dogg's rap is mentioning he wants to make America Crip again he explained that the Crips were originally founded to be sort of the new Black Panther Party obviously what they ended up being was a very violent gang in California so for him to lecture about Donald Trump being a terrible person and with Eminem - but enter promote gang culture is a bit absurd I would think snoops also a drive-by shooting criminals so you know I mean it's at least it's of a piece when he says we want to make pun intended then he wants to make America Crip again Beaubois is there anything redeeming about this terrible music because I try you know people say I'm like an old curmudgeon I sound like a caricature of just an old Republican or like you kids with your hip-hop but it's horrible it's just not good I so frequently tried to convince myself that hip-hop songs are like are good or in any way but I can't they're just terrible is there anything redeeming about it well as Aristotle said Michael as Aristotle said Michael music gives soul to the universe and to be quite honest I've always found hip-hop to be a very miserable genre of music it won its way to carnal of a genre it just it's all about just just the beat itself and that's why if you listen to even like a quote-unquote good hip hop song you're pretty much bored with it within like to two or three days and you never really want to return to listen to whatever again so that's one thing but in terms of the culture that it's bred especially when you look at previous musician black musicians of previous generation you had soul music you had gentlemen like a Nat King Cole so such a beautiful music that contributed so wonderfully to the American Songbook and and there's nothing that's gonna be remembered in hip-hop 50 years from now it's just gonna be considered just like oh yeah a music genre that came in life but nobody's gonna be returning to the classics of Snoop Dogg you know singing about money on his mind 50 years from now and and you know the horrible culture of misogyny that it bread's so I look forward to its death completely you're a hopeless optimist rather I think they probably will be looking back on these guys and you mentioned the how carnal the music is it's all about sex and treating women terribly but you know you bring up soul music to soul music is extremely sensual in some ways carnal but soul music is great there are a lot of excellent songs in Soul and Motown that kind of take you on a journey and they're musically somewhat sophisticated and lyrically compelling and this stuff is just garbage so I even tried I've tried to listen to Kanye one time because everyone told me well mostly Kanye just told me he's the greatest musical genius ever so I decided to see if he was right and the thing is he is sort of good in that he has good taste in music so he samples good songs and then he makes them worse by singing on them so like even even wrote song with Paul McCartney write a couple songs one is called only one which is really good Kim Kardashian said it was her favorite Kanye song it's her favorite Kanye song cuz Paul McCartney wrote it and then he and it sounds really good except for Kanye's awful voice but I think that's that's the trouble maybe they have a good sense of music but just they don't have any talent so it produces this garbage and but we'll have to tie that into maybe one of Andrew Klavan segments are crappy culture
