00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
in just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours Americans will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,430
a new president elect and a new

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,280
runner-up Donald<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump is never won or</font>

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,800
lost a political race before but Hillary

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,269
Clinton knows the torture of a

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,429
concession speech well this isn't

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,090
exactly the party I'd planned but I sure

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,010
liked the company vice news spoke with

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,750
speech writers from earlier campaigns

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,730
find out how they prepare for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,680
hardest speech a candidate ever has to

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,899
give it is the most authentic moment on

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,149
a campaign and what's a more humbling

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,980
and honest moment then right after

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,809
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been rejected by a lot of people</font>

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,789
for a really important job that maybe

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,350
you've prepared your whole life for I

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,430
promise you four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that I would</font>

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,910
never lie to you so I can't stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or</font>

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,370
night<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't hurt concession</font>

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,719
speeches can sometimes be even more

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,460
important than victory speeches and more

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,710
memorable there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to</font>

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,019
write for history because it often is

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,570
the last word from that person on what

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,880
their campaign was I was thinking on the

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,890
way down the elevator tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,170
first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my life I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,470
to do the weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about being a</font>

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">speechwriter is I'm taking that</font>

31
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,220
emotional pivot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about seven days out</font>

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,799
from the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the campaign you have</font>

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider fully a reality that you've</font>

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,880
not wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider for the entire</font>

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,150
length of the campaign

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,730
and you kind of feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,320
keep it even under wraps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on this I literally walked into</font>

39
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,910
the ballroom with a folder and on one

40
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,080
side was a victory<font color="#E5E5E5"> speech on one side</font>

41
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,250
was a concession speech I just had to

42
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the call which one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are we going</font>

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,980
to use tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish Godspeed to the</font>

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,710

be my president one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the goals is to</font>

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,220
help your supporters who are feeling

47
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,520
angry place that anger in the proper

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,670
place most concession speeches after

49
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,130
people give them everybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> America</font>

50
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,740
sits back and says I wish they had been

51
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,290
that person the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> way along but in</font>

52
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,580
an American election there are no losers

53
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,930
because whether or not our candidates

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,140
are successful the next morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all</font>

55

the results of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the election democracy is</font>

58
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,570
more important than any of our personal

59
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,150
grievances that sends a message what

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,880
worldwide and tonight for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sake of</font>

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,890
our unity of the people and the strength

62
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,459
of our democracy I offer my concession

63
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,670
his speech reminded us that we are

64
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">united not by the people we support but</font>

65
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,530
by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> institution's we've created and I</font>

call<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all Americans I particularly</font>

67
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,019
urge all who stood with us to unite

68
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,700
behind our next president

69
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,739
it was this incredible patriotic<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

70
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,800
where he said that's more important<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,920
me I think McCain's concession speech

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,590
was one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best beaches</font>

73
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,099
in recent memory today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a candidate</font>

74
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the highest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> office in the country I</font>

servant there needs to be the sense that

77
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,670
we both present in our case and you came

78
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">out winning without a loser's concession</font>

79
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,019
speech it undermines the institutions of

democracy of the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our elections</font>

81
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,640
work of the idea that our democracy is

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,110
stronger and more durable and more

83
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,450
resilient than any one vote concession

84
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,160
