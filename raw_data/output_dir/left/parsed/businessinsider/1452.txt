oh yeah I'm definitely into calling the
floats there's a lot of different
benefits to it without the obviously the
epsom salts and magnesium that are in
those tanks that help with recovery and
relaxing your muscles and things like
that then also just a sensory
deprivation aspect of it it's the one of
the only places you can really get
unplugged from all you know noise and
just distractions that goes on with
daily life so you spend about an hour
hour and a half and in the pod probably
once every two weeks or so so it just
helps you recharge don't you refresh and
allows you to just be you and your
thoughts for an hour which was hard to
come and I was you know our fast-paced
society so it's just fun
