three van loads full of arrestees who were many of them carried out of the Senate Budget Committee hearing today are being taken to jail there is a van that has only women there is a band that has only men moments ago the Senate Budget Committee voted on a party-line to advance the tax reform bill I was I guess you could say embedded with the protesters okay one sentence I was embedded with the protesters from the beginning of the day let's roll back the tape and you can see how we got here did people stay at this hotel overnight or was this just a gathering place it was a gathering place but some of us stayed together in st. Stephen's Episcopal Church in the church on the floor a few people stayed here and some people came down from New York on the bus today okay so we are going to the Senate Banking Committee Dirksen 6:08 we would like you guys to be as close to the front as possible we have some people saving seats inside the room Megan from justice and access initiative over there now is going to start chanting at some point my first death no I think she was going first she's going to make Megan and Mario I'm terrified I'm scared I mean you know nervous when I first met you you were advocating for the health of your daughter your sign was very moving and that's why we met I interviewed you and now you're here to fight against tax reform is it because of the provision that was added by the Senate to repeal the individual mandate or do you also care about tax reform it's a lot of things I do care about tax reform because the student loan deduction is big for me and my husband but the reason why I'm willing to disrupt a hearing over it is my daughter the if the ACA is dismantled then she can't have access to health care if the deficit is huge and they cut Medicaid and then she loses access to health care they're going to be drastic cuts to Medicaid to help pay for the tax cuts to the wealthy these cuts will affect my friends I'm not on myself but a lot of disabled people are this affects the poorest of the poor it's heinous this really seems like it's a health care themed protest you know you may be able to find people who have their different concerns but the center of this for us is health care I have student loans that's gonna affect me but it's something that I may or may not be able to manage but when you talk about health care and you know just services people will die the only way unless you're gonna cut it out of the defense budget the only way to generate the type of tax cuts that Trump and his friends were talking about generating was to go to the social safety net right so we know that the money is going to come from Medicare the average citizen doesn't understand what's buried in this bill homeowners deductions electric cars clean energy higher education so many things are gonna be destroyed by this bill and it's all just where can we find more money to get to the rich some of my colleagues at TYT investigates ask the White House to explain how this team of billionaires and their families that Donald Trump has chosen to run our government don't have financial conflicts of interest with a bill like this and their answer was this bill is going to actually benefit all Americans because it will create jobs increase wages and therefore all Americans have a conflict so trickle-down economics has been shown time and time again to not work when the big corporations of the rich get tax cuts they do not send that money down the line and in fact if you look at the stockholder meetings where the corporate heads are talking about what they're gonna do with the money they say from this tax bill all of them say the money they save is going to go back to their investors as dividends and other perks for them not one of them said we're gonna take the money that we save and create more jobs I have contemplated risking arrests and I am risking arrest I think a lot of folks here are risking arrest because we feel that this is really important to us from all the states from Alaska from Arizona from Virginia from Pennsylvania from Idaho folks flew in because this is important to us and we will risk arrest to make a statement why does that statement you think reach more people then if you just held a rally outside I think that rallies and holding signs outside of your Senators office and yelling at the building when they're not there is not as effective as going and talking to those senators and risking arrest to do so what would you say to someone watching this who maybe shares your sentiment but isn't really prepared to participate in the way that you are well first off I just call it democracy timeout it's not really resisting arrest it is obviously but the majority of it is just paperwork it's not as scary as people want you to believe and the end result is absolutely worth it if we win this fight I was speaking to a friend last night he said why are you going down I thought you were a health care activist and I said you don't know that this bill will do more damage to health care than the Obamacare repeal would have done it's going to destroy Medicare destroy Medicaid destroy the ACA and dozens of other programs there's an if-then statement that people have to understand right if 1.4 trillion dollars are added to the debt over ten years and we have to borrow that kind of money then what then there will be twenty eight billion dollars in Medicare cuts automatically next year and for every year thereafter so a number of critical social programs will be cut and plus tax deductions for essential other programs will be cut 25 billion it's going to be cut from Medicaid another 25 billion will be cut from Medicare so I could lose on my personal care and not be able to sorry and not be able to get out of bed in the morning Rebeca final words here we go don't kill us don't kill us
