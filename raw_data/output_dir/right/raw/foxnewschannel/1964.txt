THE WHOLE PREMISE ON WHICH TRUMP

23
00:00:56,944 --> 00:01:02,316

UNCONVENTIONAL WAR.

27
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:08,322
THAT IS WHAT TERROR IS,

28
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:13,961
CONSTANTLY SHIFTING TACTICS.

29
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,695
IRAN IS THE COCA-COLA OR PEPSI

30
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:15,429
OF SPONSORSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO

31
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:16,363
TERRORISM.

32
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:19,967
THE PRES.'S DECISION TO PULL OUT

33
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:24,338
OF THIS DEAL, SOMETHING THAT

34
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:24,838

00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:34,181
TO EVERYONE I SAY TOO BAG, HAD

36
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:34,581

39
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:36,383
IT HAD TO HAPPEN.

40
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,117
THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IRAN

41
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:44,925
WITH ANY TYPE OF NUCLEAR WEAPON.

42
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:45,659
24 MONTHS IN THE MAKING OF HUMAN

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,594

TOGETHER A NUCLEAR WAR.

47
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:57,838
DONALD TRUMP'S REACTION WAS ON

48
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:58,572
POINT AND THE REST OF THE WORLD

49
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:04,511

50
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,245

00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:16,857
ANYTHING ELSE EXEMPTED UNDER THE

58
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:17,558
JCP AWAY LIKE PRECIOUS METAL.

59
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:20,027
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS PLAYS OUT

60
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:24,965
WITH OUR ALLIES?

61
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:29,336
>> THE EUROPEANS ARE ALL ABOUT

62
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,003
THE EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP AND

63
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:30,637
EUROPEAN ECONOMY CAN THE

64
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:31,839
STRUGGLE THEY HAD AND THE

65
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:37,377
PROBLEMS EUROPE HAS BEEN HAVING

66
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:40,948
FOR QUITE SOME TIME, ALL

67
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:41,482
ECONOMICALLY BASED.

68
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:42,216
THE MONEY WILL START POURING IN.

69
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:44,952
IRAN, THEY DO A LOT OF BUSINESS

70
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:45,319
WITH IRAN.

71
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,053
WHEN YOU CUT OFF THEIR FUNNEL,

72
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:46,787
THE GATEWAY TO THE DOLLARS THEY

73
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,956
WILL START CRYING COOL.

74
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:49,690
EUROPEANS WHEN IT COMES TO IRAN,

75
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:55,996
THE MONEY, THE CASH FLOW,

76
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:56,663
BOOSTING THEIR ECONOMY AND

77
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:57,397
PERSONAL INTERESTS HAS NOTHING

78
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:58,098
TO DO WITH THE UNITED STATES.

79
00:02:58,098 --> 00:02:59,266
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF

80
00:02:59,266 --> 00:02:59,967

UNDERSTOOD VERY EARLY ON WHEN HE

85
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:18,252
