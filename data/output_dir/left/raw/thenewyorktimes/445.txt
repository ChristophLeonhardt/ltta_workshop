1
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,580
I always kind of looked at them
as not necessarily pride

2
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,770
in what they represented but
just, like that's part of my

3
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,010
city. That’s kind of
part of who we are.

4
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,730
But part of New Orleans is also
that it changes, you know

5
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,580
like every city so—

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,650
I think this is kind of a step
in the right direction.

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,820
You don’t put a swastika
up by mistake.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,860
You don’t put a rebel flag
up by mistake.

9
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,680
There are direct
intentions behind that,

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,120
rooted in very old traditions
and very old history

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,960
that always allocates itself back to
the enslavement of my ancestors.

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,690
I’m here to defend my heritage.
These are my ancestors.

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,010
When you try to explain to them about it,
all they want to spout out to you

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,310
is that you’re a racist.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,499
It extends beyond racism.

16
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:12,600
A lot of these people even on
the other side of those

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,440
barricades, they want things
to stay the same.

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,040
Do we want to have
monuments tell our history?

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,490
We either need to reinterpret
them somehow,

20
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,460
or acknowledge that that story
is going to be told by the

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:00:00,000
people who created those
monuments.
