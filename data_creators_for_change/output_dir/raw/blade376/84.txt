00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
hey everyone hope all is well look I'm

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,500
so sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made a video in a</font>

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,750
while but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been so so busy it's been</font>

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,269
over two years in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> making but finally</font>

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,389
at last my band's debut album dry lung

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,490
rhetoric is about to come out it is an

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,070
11-track album which is of the metal

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,859
genre but there is a lot of melodies in

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,900
it there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of aggression in it and</font>

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,970
actually every song seems to tackle a

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,609
different sort of metal because we know

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,560
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so many genres after all as</font>

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,689
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I love making my youtube videos</font>

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,659
because I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be direct with you</font>

15
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">music is just another facet of media</font>

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can use to reach out to people</font>

17
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,780
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced my band to trust me</font>

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the way that we release this album</font>

19
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,059
because times are changing you know with

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,640
digital media with the internet with

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,129
piracy on the rise I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

22
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,140
to be smart about it and therefore on

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Friday November 23rd we are going to be</font>

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">releasing this debut album for free on</font>

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,730
YouTube the 11 tracks will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be released</font>

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,729
as 11 separate videos but<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font>

27
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos will be an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> official music one</font>

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on with my friends from</font>

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,720
horsey in the hedge last<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday the band</font>

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,330
and I were at an aircraft hangar where

31
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,049
we had fire smoke and dust and I can't

32
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,670
begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you how excited I am to</font>

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,700
show you this video it just looks so so

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,009
epic well we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a record label</font>

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,710
we want to do this off our own backs and

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,210
therefore over the past couple of years

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,090
we've been saving up lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money so we</font>

38
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,460
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a professional video so we can</font>

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,340
create merchandise and copies of our

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,040
albums in physical form but then of

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,780
course we're just giving it away all for

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,790
free right the metaphor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to use is</font>

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,909
you wouldn't go into a clothes store to

44
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,130
buy a suit and just hand over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money</font>

45
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,590
and then they give you the suit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,020
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you like it I like to see it</font>

47
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,119
the other way<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that you get to</font>

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to all the music and if you enjoy</font>
