Trump's leadership or even that his party might well lose the house to an opposition hell-bent on his downfall the dilemma which he does not fully grasp is that many of the senior officials and his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations I would know I am one of them I Q an on I anonymous and one of them to be clear ours is not the Popular Resistance of the left we want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous but we believe our first duty is to this country and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the help of our Republic so let me just point out here that this editorial has already gone off the rails for a couple of reasons one if you say that you're part of the resistance to Trump helping him to do the right thing you just made sure that President Trump is going to go on a mole hunt to oust anyone who is trying to help him do the right thing from your own point of view you've ensured that President Trump is going to go full-on bring everybody into room prisoner's dilemma bring in the rubber pipe beat the crap out of people we're gonna separate people into rooms and threaten their families until we find out who is thwarting the president's will second those two sentences are in complete contrast with one another one is that they want the administration to succeed and think many of its policies been great and then there's a sentence that says that they believe their first duties to the country and the president continues to act in a manner detrimental to the health of our Republic how do you want the administration to succeed if you think the president is acting in a manner detrimental to the health of the Republic this is basically justifying everything president Trump ever said about the deep state but it's actually just the shallow state it's a bunch of people working inside his administration who presumably he appointed who are working to thwart his will and then talking about it in the New York Times the predictable effect of which will be to lower his approval ratings and ensured that he has a tougher time with reelection in 2020 so why exactly would you say that you're standing up for the administration if you actually believe that your job in the administration is to help the administration succeed make sure the president Trump doesn't go off the rails make his policy better for him when necessary why would you go talk about it why would you then go and talk about it that doesn't make any sense at all I mean it's legitimately a member of the criminal conspiracy saying you know what I'm involved in criminality I'm gonna go talk to the police about how well I'm attempting to make this criminal conspiracy work you're talking to the very people who are attempting to make sure that Trump exits office so clearly there's something disingenuous about this piece from the outset the piece continues this is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while forwarding mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he's out of office so clearly don't want the administration to succeed you want him out of office the root of the problem is the president's immorality anyone who works with him knows he is not more to any discernible first principles that guide his decision-making which is like forget about people who work with him like anybody who watches him for any prolonged period of time knows this is true the president considers himself a pragmatist he's never said that he is a first principles guy although he was elected as a Republican the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives free minds free markets free people at best has invoked these ideals in scripted settings at worst he's attacked them outright in addition to his mass marketing of the notion that the press is the enemy of the people president Trump's impulses are generally anti trade and anti-democratic don't get me wrong there are bright spots that the near ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture effective deregulation historic tax reform a more robust military and more but these successes have come despite not because of the president's leadership style which is impetuous adversarial petty and ineffective and it continues along these lines for paragraphs and paragraphs with the result that they say that there's this this anonymous author inside the Trump administration says they have a two-track presidency take foreign policy in public and private president Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators such as Vladimir Putin of Russia and kim jeong-hoon and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us two allied like-minded nations astute observers have noted though that the rest of the administration is operating on another track 1 more countries like Russia are called out from meddling and punished accordingly and we're allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals well we know all of this and they the the piece says this isn't the work of the so-called deep state it's the work of the steady state so yes we are thwarting the president when we are doing so because we are the steady state and then this author suggests that perhaps we should think about removing the president through the 25th amendment invoking the 25th amendment they say that no one wants to precipitate a constitutional crisis so instead they're going to steer the administration in the right direction until one way or another it is over and then there is a bunch of references there a bunch of references to John McCain and how wonderful John McCain is and all the rest of it so there are a bunch of questions to be asked one who is this person okay it is not a cabinet-level official it is known with presidential aspirations it's the riskiest political move ever it is not Mike Pence despite how much the left would love it to be Mike Pence quietly stabbing president Trump between the shoulder blades with his trademark bland smile that is not happening okay the vice president doing that it is not nikki Haley who is safely ensconced in New York far away from the silliness of the White House this is some second-tier low-level staffer okay it's a senior official half the people in the White House have the title senior official in the White House this is probably some senior official in like John Kelly's team who doesn't like Trump very much and feels like they might featherbed their exit and that that's really what the motive here is the motive here is that it will be revealed okay within within a week we'll know who this person is and this person because it's not gonna stay secret and this person is gonna come out too great applause from the left this was a person who was trying to thwart Trump and Trump fired him how could from fire this person who's trying to just make the administration better and this person will become not any inside the White House resistance leader but a resistance resistance leader that they will turn into a a full-on and a navarro character on MSNBC they'll be given a rich TV contract they'll give him a big given a rich book contract they will be given exactly they'll be exonerated exculpated for all of their terrible terrible activity in associating with President Trump this is the maiya culpa it's a preliminary Maricopa and it allows the person to exit the administration amidst glory and huzzah that's really what this editorial is for so if you believe for a second that this editorial is truly designed to either make the administration better or to inform the American people you're wrong first of all we already knew all this stuff legitimately like everything that this guy says in the editorial I've been saying for well for well over a year on this program since legitimately a couple of months into the administration I said this administration is running along two tracks President Trump says stuff and then the people around him implement stuff and those are not the same stuff there's been very obvious to anyone who watches at any level when I was on Bill Maher's show I said this Bill Maher's and well he always talks about Vladimir Putin and I said right but then if you look at the policy of the administration it is not what he says the policy of the administration is very harsh on Russia it's it's quite obvious that this administration involves the president saying a lot of stuff being hands-off delegating power to a lot of folks and when people say it's a constitutional crisis to have people around the president thwarting his will I'm not even sure what that means it's not as though they are hiding him in a closet preventing him from doing things he wants to do they understand that the president forgets about things and doesn't care that much about other things and that if they just don't put something on his desk he's unlikely to ever remember it again so they just don't put it on his desk like is the president's will what he wants to do in the moment or as the president's will what he cares about over the long haul because this sort of manipulation does happen at a much lower level in other administration's there are people who are slow walking policy all the time you donate your job how many times at your job does your boss say I need something on my desk now and you think you know what you'll be better if my boss got this tomorrow I'm just gonna slow walk it today is that you thwarting the will of your company or is that you using your independent judgment to try and make the company better because maybe your boss is about to make a rash decision as sort of stuff happens all the time in in your regular job if Trump doesn't like it he still is plenary power over the executive branch you can fire whomever it wants this person will be uncovered and fired nonetheless the White House is is going to be torn apart by the chaos of now attempting to of attempting to uncover who exactly the mole is and president Trump reacts as his apt to do in pretty much the worst possible way to this particular op-ed and just as I'm sure the op-ed author wanted him to react which is by acting off the rails and that's sort of the entire point of what the author was trying to do here we'll talk about that in just a second first let's talk about the look of your home so you look around your home and it just feels shabby you're not sure why well believe it or not it might be the window coverings in fact you probably haven't

the President of the United States reacts as you would expect him to react to an op-ed from inside his administration the killers in the house ah calling from upstairs on the phone oh my god okay so president Trump reacts in typical trumpian fashion he is in front of a crowd of sheriffs who are some of his closest allies because he's very Pro law enforcement and here's President Trump ripping into the failing New York Times yeah the New York Times and and all of these phony media outlets will be out of business folks they'll be out of business because there'll be nothing to write and there'll be nothing of interest so if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial can you believe it anonymous meaning gutless a gutless editorial we're doing a great job okay and the truth is he's not wrong about being gutless like if the person actually wants to take a stand against the administration publicly quit quit and talk about how terrible it was or alternatively if you actually want to work inside the administration and make it a better place shut your face why are you going to the New York Times to brag about how you anonymously are helping the administration from the inside except to provide yourself cover later this is very obviously self-interested do you really think anybody at the New York Times would have printed an anonymous op-ed from somebody inside the Obama administration making the same claims highly highly highly doubtful because prints economist op eds is kind of frowned upon it's kinda frowned upon for pretty good reason which is that there's no way to vet the claims of the person who's actually making those claims but we don't know who the senior official is it could be some low-level person who's met from once there are hundreds of people working in the White House hundreds of them so that is quite plausible but President Trump then goes to Twitter and he decides that he is going to lose it so President Trump had a couple of tweets he tweeted out does the so-called senior administration official really exist or is it just the failing New York Times with another phony source if the gutless anonymous person does indeed exist The Times must for national security purposes turned him or her over to government at once so no no times I'm gonna do that that's not a thing yeah the press doesn't have to turn people over to the federal government for writing them op-ed that rips on the administration that's not an actual thing and then the president had one more tweak all caps treason question mark so I guess now we're going to execute this person we're gonna find them they're like the proscribed penalty in the Constitution for treason is death so presumably we will find this person take them out back and trumple them get he'll take his tie off and then he will strangle him with with the oversized red tie it'll be quite amusing but here's the problem with President Trump's response basically the op eds has the president's accredited and it is it's a terrible stupid backwards outrageously dumb op-ed but the central contention is President Trump is a crazy man and we have to restrain him and president Trump's responses I'm not crazy you're crazy you're you're so crazy I'm gonna take your head off I'm gonna take care I want to rip it off your neck and then I'm going to defecate down your throat oh that's what I'm gonna do to you I am going to rip your legs off and beat you to death with them you're calling me crazy and out of control how dare you and believe about unreal mr. president if you wanted to react in you know the fashion that is most likely to put this to bed what you would say is ah there they are talking again of course the New York Times is gonna print this sort of stuff no not they should turn it over this bastard me so I can blow a hole in and with this drill I'll just take this this I have a screwdriver right here I was stabbed in the face 100 times I will shoot him on Fifth Avenue and I lose no support at this point you have to laugh so you don't cry because it is it is pretty wild stuff but it is also true that this op-ed does no good it is actually deeply counterproductive because all it does in the end is Drive President Trump to throw out anyone who may be actually trying to curb those worst excesses and now we get to spend months trying to trying to you know drill down on how it is drill down on exactly how it is that this this happened in the first place okay meanwhile speaking of stupidity awfulness counterproductive nonsense we need to stop these judicial hearings these judicial hearings are a waste of time these Senate Judiciary Committee hearings are just a place for prospective presidential candidates to grandstand now Brett Kavanaugh is doing you know a fine job at what his job is here in these judicial hearings which is to obfuscate how he feels on every particular issue the way this works thanks to Ruth Bader Ginsburg is that Ruth Bader Ginsburg once she was questioned about specific cases she said I'm not going to answer any questions about prospective cases or cases in the past I'm gonna sit here and look at you weird and that was basically how Everage that's now how we do judicial hearings they people ask questions that are designed to elicit a response from the cheering throng on either side of the aisle and then the judge sits there and the judge basically stares weirdly at them well that's basically what happened yesterday and Cavanaugh's Pro added I mean here's Cavanaugh for example giving an answer on Roe versus Wade this is clip 11 here's Cavanaugh answering on Roe versus Wade giving about the vaguest answer you could possibly give senator I said that it's settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled the respect under principles of starry decisis and I understand your point of view on that Center and I understand how passionate and how deeply people feel about this issue I understand the importance of the issue I understand the the importance that people attached to the roe v wade decision to the Planned Parenthood versus Casey decision okay that that's a big way of saying nothing roni says that is precedent based on precedent right and the Supreme Court is not bound by precedent so what are you gonna do on the case the answer is we have no idea that's not stopping the New York Times from printing leaked Cavanaugh documents about abortion and affirmative action and they're calling it a bombshell a bombshell is it really a bombshell no of course it's not a bombshell of course it's not a bombshell judge Cavanaugh when he was working for the Bush administration was considering a draft opinion piece that supporters of one of mr. Bush's Conservatives appeals to court nominees hope they could persuade anti-abortion women to submit under their names it stated it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that roe v wade and his progeny are the settled law of the land and Cavanaugh proposed deleting that line writing I'm not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe is the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since the court can always overrule its precedent and three current justices on the court would do so that doesn't mean he would do so that is an apt and accurate description of the state of the law the Supreme Court can overrule anything when people say settled law of the land what they really mean is we don't want people to reopen it and it's an inaccurate description there's no such thing as the settled law in the lay of the land in Supreme Court jurisprudence sorry decisis does not always apply precedent does not always apply if it did then Plessy vs. Ferguson would still be on the books and people would still be segregating bus cars at the behest of the state so that's not a thing but again Brett Kavanaugh is being run through the ringer specifically for political purposes here for example is is Cavanaugh being asked about presidential pardons again he's not gonna answer this question but we're gonna pretend like these hearings matter the question of self pardons is something I have never analyzed it's a question that I have not written about it's a question therefore that's a hypothetical question that I can't begin with knots or in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme other half of that is okay so again he's got no answer on that cuz he doesn't have to answer any of that this entire hearing is just designed for Democrats to grandstand for 2020 they are basically just standing there shouting and just shouting that's it right there they're my son when he wakes up in the morning and he screams from his from his crib Dada come get me okay this is these are the Democrats it pay attention to me attention now please ah dad I just saved you like 35 hours of watching Senate Judiciary Committee committee hearings that's all Senate Democrats are doing and right now the two who are best at it are Kamala Harris who is being taken seriously and Cory Booker who is a parody of a parody Cory Booker is a muppet he's a human Muppet and all he does is a human Muppet is just make weird faces at people and I mean he literally called himself Spartacus in a hearing this morning I am not kidding you Cory fricking Booker just called himself Spartacus at a hearing this morning I'll have to explain why he called himself Spartacus any hearing this morning because he really is astonishing and hilarious and also he doesn't understand how Spartacus work like Spartacus ended up crucified so there's that but it's all good times for Cory Booker and the Senate Judiciary Committee we'll talk about all that in just a second first let's talk about the fact that time is moving slowly that means you're checking your watch more often when you check your watch shouldn't you have something nice like this shouldn't you have a watch that you like looking at because it's classy and it's simple and it's minimalist and it looks nice well that is where movement comes in we've talked about movement before on the program obviously you know there are these two college dropouts they started their own watch company and the company has grown like crazy they've now sold 2 million watches in 160 plus countries and they continue to revolutionize fashion in the belief that style shouldn't break the bank movement has come pretty far in the past year they've not only introduced a bunch of new watch collections for men and women they've also expanded to sunglasses fashion for bracelets for her I've got the sunglasses my wife has the sunglasses too they have all these great options and they as I say they're really durable so this makes a difference to young parents like me because my kids will grab my watch and just truck them against the wall movement washes stand up to the beating movement watches are about looking good keeping it simple they don't tell you how many steps you've taken they don't blow up your wrist with text messages instead they just tell you the time in the classiest way movement watches start at ninety five bucks at a department store they're like four hundred five hundred bucks they cut out the middleman right now get 15% off today with free shipping and free returns by going to MVM t-dot-com slash Shapiro that's MVM t.com slash Shapiro see why the movement keeps growing MVM t-dot-com slash Shapiro join the movement go check it out right now okay so Cory Booker as I say he calls himself Spartacus why because he decided today and who's gonna violate the rules of the Senate by simply releasing a bunch of classified documents now the way this works is that there are a bunch of documents that are shown to the various senators on the Judiciary Committee that are held closely by executive privilege if you're working for the Bush administration the Bush administration has the right to say that the legislative branch does not get to see things because that is executive privilege it is pro the executive is not subject to the dictates of the legislature so the legislature can't just say we want every document everything Bush ever said to all of his all of the advocates we want all of that in front of us now that's not a thing in constitutional jurisprudence so there's basically a deal that was made with the Senate Judiciary Committee which is they get to see all these Cavanaugh documents on the condition that they are not asked about publicly so so it can decide the votes of the people on the committee but it is not meant to it is not meant to undercut the executive power right so Cory Booker being a grandstanding idiot he decides you know what is a great idea I'm just gonna release these documents I'm just gonna come out and release these documents I'm gonna violate Senate rules I'm just gonna state it upfront and then if you want to if you want to expel me from the Center for violation of Senate rules if you want to place if you want to expel me from the Senate if you want to expel me then do it I'm just like Spartacus except I'm begging you to crucify me see the thing about Spartacus is that he didn't actually want to be identified as Spartacus because then they would kill him which is why everyone identified as Spartacus but Cory Booker doesn't know anything because he's stupid so instead he says that he has led Spartacus in basically begging to be crucified please please expel me points to it because if you do it maybe I can run for president cuz I'll show how much Republicans hate me and then I can make weird googly eyes and I can do it weird jazz fingers it'll be all weird but I'll be President cuz weird so here's cory booker being all weird i will say that i did willingly violate the chairs rule on the committee confidential process i take full responsibility for violating that sir and i violated because i sincerely believe that the public deserves to know this nominees a record in this particular case his record on issues of race and the law and and i could not understand and i violated this rule knowingly why why these issues should be withheld from the public now I appreciate the comments of my colleagues this is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment oh my god this guy's like the Nick Cage of the Senate just every every scene that he acts in yeah hey what what are you what yeah have you ever seen chewing of the scenery like this here's the thing Kamala Harris is good at playing the prosecutor on TV and she's actually good at this Cory Booker is just he's the worst kid in her high school drama class he liked the kid who watched who at one point watched movies in like the 1980s and thought that Arnold Schwarzenegger his performance in Kindergarten Cop was the apotheosis of good acting I was like you know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna shout a lot whoo-hoo things that William Shatner is a great actor and he's like William Shatner everything he says his God every single thing so there's cory booker doing that and then cory booker he's just he's just the worst the knowingly violating the rules like he's been he says i knowingly violated the rose am giving you every motivation you can for its please i need the attention no one's paying attention to me pat you Debbie please there's cory booker again pay attention to him people pay attention he needs your attention he wants your attention why don't you love him why do you pay attention you can't just ignore me it's gonna boil a rabbit there's cory booker - senator Cornyn actually made a very good I knowingly violated the rules that were put for and I'm told that the committee confidential rules have knowing confident consequences and so sir I come from a long line as all of us do as Americans and understand what but that kind of civil disobedience is and I understand the consequences so I am right now before your before your process is finished I'm going to release the email about racial profiling and I understand that that the penalty comes with potential I'll sting from the Senate please ask me please please show the Democrats that I'm really committed to the show all the base that I'm really committed to this may Elsa me from make me a martyr martyr me martyr me it's like oh my god he's just terrible at this so it actually makes you appreciate Kamala Harris who is better at this right I mean at least if you're gonna watch this sort of thing you hope that they're pretty good at it Kamala Harris is better at it or at least she's being taken more seriously by the media she's decided that she is now going to go after Brett Kavanaugh based on what based on like the stupidest crap you've ever heard so here's Kamala Harris completely getting wrong the law about abortion well done Kamala can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body I'm happy to answer her more specific question but male versus female there are medical procedures I mean the government that the government has the power to make a decision about a man's body I'm not a I'm not a thinking of any right now senator okay what she's trying to go for it is when it come I mean she's just obviously phrasing this in the dumbest possible way so that it looks as though the law is unequal when it comes to abortion because all we're talking about is a female body whereas there are no restrictions on what a male can do to his own body except when we actually do have laws against suicide like we can actually put you in jail for not jail but we can we can actually forcibly you know incarcerated not and what's the word I'm looking for we can actually we can put you on a psychiatric hold for 48 hours if you're suicidal so if you are if you are a man we can call the cops you and do that also we do have laws on the books that allow with male bodies to be harmed they're actually called pro-abortion laws those pro bortion laws allow male bodies to be harmed because they're inside female bodies so there's that there's Kamala Harris grandstanding I do love Brett Kavanaugh just looking blankly at her like what are you what are you saying no say who say what what in the world and then this is the best one so Kamala Harris has decided she's got the goods what are the goods she thinks that Brett Cavanaugh has talked to some worm from the firm of Kassovitz Casa what's his firm that is used by the President of the United States with regard to his defense and so she asked Brett Kavanaugh if he's ever had a conversation with anyone who worked for Casa watts which is a firm that legitimately has hundreds and hundreds of lawyers about the Muller investigation the implication being that Brett Kavanaugh somehow talked to Trump's lawyers about how he would handle the Muller investigation with which he is not involved in any way but she's got she's going to suggest the reason Trump is picking Cavanaugh is because Cavanaugh is somehow going to allow Trump to escape them all our investigation this was ranking real high unsorted left his pornography list yesterday so this is this one is running up the pornography list people were really just self-flagellating over it really enjoying themselves here was Kamala Harris making a fool of herself men Michael a Vinod he got involved in Michael haven't any basically shredded her so it's pretty funny Kassovitz Benson and Torres which is the law firm founded by Mark Casa wits who is president Trump's personal lawyer are you have you had any conversation about robert muller or his investigation with anyone at that firm yes or no well is there a person you're talking I'm asking you a very direct question yes or no yeah I need to know the I'm not sure I know everyone who works at that law firm I don't think you need to I think you need to know who you talked with who'd you talk to okay and then it continued like this for like seven and a half minutes okay casis Benson has 266 attorneys do you think that he's got he's got he's racking his brains right now going who have I talked to you did they once work at Kassovitz I don't want to perjure myself by saying I've never talked to anybody about the Muller invent like I don't remember every conversation I've ever had about the Muller investigation I've talked to thousands of people it turns out about the Muller investigation but I'm not sure who worked for Casa woods at the time but this was supposed to be you know the great the great uncovering of course there's nothing there Michael avenatti basically said this is a big mistake you know prosecutors are not supposed to ask questions to which they don't already know the answers so if it turns out that Kamala Harris has nothing here then she was just grandstanding and speaking of grandstanding you just heard Colonel Cory Booker talking about how he was going to uncover all of the evils of Brett Kavanaugh by revealing all this classified information it turns out that Cory Booker he played himself Cory Booker played himself congratulations he played himself Cory Booker the the emails what do they show there's a probe there there's an email titled racial profiling and then it turns out that in these emails titled racial profiling Brett Kavanaugh openly says that we are not going to allow people to use race or national origin in airport screening and law enforcement generally in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 he says my own view is that as required by the traditional equal protection standards who must at least consider how to construct a race-neutral system I can imagine such a system that could be effective perhaps even more effective than the one based on racial classifications this sort of system would require airlines and governmental authorities to obtain more personal information from the flying public and there are some resistance that within the group on the grounds that would be too burdensome invasive privacy and so forth the people who favor some use of race or national origin obviously do not need to grapple with the interim questions but the people who generally favor effective security measures that are race neutral in fact do need to grapple and grapple now with the interim question of what to do before it truly an effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented so in other words Cory Booker wanted to show how Cavanaugh was a racist and instead showed how Cavanaugh was not in fact a racist so well done Cory Booker you complete and utter douchebag so in just one second we will get to more from the Senate

including steven crowder well sorry wouldn't want to actually discuss steven Crowder's gender but we'll talk about all that later go check us out right now we're the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so big tech hearings on the hill yesterday and things got weird even before the tech hearings start Alex Jones arrives that's not if you were if you saw him holding his phone that was not trans porn on his phone stop thinking that it was not it was not but he arrives and he had costs Marco Rubio now Rubio is one of the more polished politicians on the hill obviously Rubio happens to be a nice guy I know senator Rubio Alex Jones is not a nice guy Alex Jones the crazy person who says crazy things and then he just sort of randomly takes off his shirt and starts yelling about Satan but Satan just goes wild oh that's oh he brings that brand to the halls of the Senate and he accosts Marco Rubio about the fact that he's been banned from social media now as I say I oppose Alex Jones ban from social media unless there's an articulable standard an articulable standard of why he was ban was he banned because he threatens violence was he ban because he promotes libelous conspiracy theories like legally libelous conspiracy theorists why exactly was he banned if it's just because you don't like him that's not a good reason so I had sympathy for the argument that all these social media companies that say he was engaged in hate speech so ban him that's a problem because hate speech has no actual definition with any sort of distinguishing principle involves there's no limiting principle to hate speech that said Alex Jones arrives and he starts harassment Marco Rubio about this why he's not going to harassing the Democrats about this I'm not really sure but he goes India wrasses Marco Rubio and things go wildly wrong tens of millions of views the Rush Limbaugh he knows who went forward is playing this joke over here that's why if any platform didn't work but I don't okay so first of all the first rule of engaging with trolls is don't engage with trolls because there's really no way that it works out well although I will say that I like if there would be a physical altercation between Alex Jones and Marco Rubio and Marco Rubio who's considered bata cuck number one by the Alex Jones crowd were to knock Alex and his mega steroids coffee crop of garbage if you were to knock my eye I'm not in favor of physical violence I think law enforcement is useful we live in a civilized society for a reason but if they were to get in a physical altercation and Marco Rubio we're to undercut Alex Jones the entire brand by knocking out Alex Jones I I would laugh a little and when I say a little I mean I would never stop laughing I would miss the show the next day because the laughter would be would be so great so that's out when Marco Rubio then did an interview and what she said and I know you guys have to cover it but you guys give these crazy people way too much attention we're making crazy people superstars we're gonna get crazier people and of course Rubio is right all the coverage on Alex Jones is designed for that it is also also true that the presidents of the United States happens to be one of the people giving Alex Jones inordinate attention hey Alex Jones has been known as a crazy person for many many many years the President of the United States decided that he was a friendly and therefore he sort of legitimized him in any case these the let's talk a little bit more about these tech hearings so these tech hearings they they were they were demonstrative of the fact that these social media companies really have no clue as to what their actual goal is is their goal to quote unquote better the public discourse because if their goal is to better the public discourse then they need to be held accountable for their for all the material that appears on their pages over at Daily wire we can be sued for for libel we can be sued for copyright violation we can be sued for a variety of causes because we are a private company that is engaged in the business of editorial oversight if you are if you are basically just a platform and you're not involved in editorial over say like reddit or 4chan or presumably Facebook then you can't be sued on the same grounds so an article that we could be sued for if we post it on Facebook Facebook could not be sued for but if Facebook is policing everything and deciding what comes down and what stays up well now they look a lot more like The Daily wire than they look like the phone line then they look like just AT&T they now look like a publisher so if you're a publisher and not a platform then you have to be held to the same standard and we have to have an articulable standard so that we know exactly what's going on at your company and that was made pretty clear when representative Mark Wayne read a read tweets to the I guess his name is Mark Wayne Moen hey he read tweets to the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about about race from Sarah Zhang you member sarahs young who's now on the New York Times editorial board because only certain types of racism are okay here is a representative Mullin grilling Dorsey on white is that Sarah Jong is still on the platform but other people have been banned for similarly racist talk let me read what what miss Jang wrote hashtag cancel white people white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the Sun that's logically being only fit to live underground by graveling goblins oh man it's kind of sick how much I enjoy or how much jewelry I get out of being cruel to old white man and you can sort of see the the Twitter CEO in the cutaway shot you can see him feeling pretty uncomfortable he should feel pretty uncomfortable because it's it's ridiculous frankly that Twitter in and all of these social media companies I run the way they are where they pretend that their policing things when they really are only policing one side and that side is really perceived to be sort of the pro Trump side it meanwhile speaking of stupidity Nike has now released its new ad involving Colin Kaepernick it's designed to obviously draw all sorts of media scrutiny so we'll give them what they want here here is the Nike ad it's a voiceover from a Colin Kaepernick who obviously is not in uniform since he doesn't play football anymore he stands around and talks about cops being bad from his multi-million dollar mansion presumably and they juxtaposed Colin Kaepernick's heroism with like actual heroes in sports I mean they they actually show video are like small kids who have who have genetic conditions trying to play sports and they're comparing that to Colin Kaepernick whose great sacrifice was kneeling after he'd already become a useless backup quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers if you're born a refugee don't let it stop you from playing sucker at age 16 don't become the best basketball player on the planet be bigger than basketball believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything when they talk about the greatest team in the history of sport make sure is your team if you have only one hand don't just watch football play at the highest level and here a girl from Compton don't just become a tennis player become the greatest athlete ever you have to sacrifice everything when Tollan Kaepernick did by being signed to a multi-million dollar contract and being treated as a civil rights hero despite having lived in a Tony white suburb for most of his upbringing and then playing for millions of dollars badly so thank you for that Nike it really really just done what's amazing about this is all of these success stories or at least a huge number of these success stories that are being shown here are American success stories Venus Williams in Serena Williams are American success stories the u.s. women's soccer team is an American success story these are stories that happen in America because America is a great country but we are going to be presented with this theme by a corporation attempting to make money in America off American citizens that really America is a place that presents nothing but endless obstacles and challenges and you have to be a self sacrificial character like Colin Kaepernick to truly sacrifice everything whole thing's ridiculous and insulting but I guess if Nike thinks they can make money off it more power to them if they lose some sneaker sales off of it I would not be heartbroken over any of that okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I've been rewatching roam on HBO it's early HBO which means early HBO is even more poorni than sort of later HBO yeah you can see this with Game of Thrones where Game of Thrones started in every two scenes there was some graphic sex scene because it was like we know or pay cable if you're if you want to watch pay cable at least you'll get some boobies that that's really how the programming goes at HBO so there's some of that in Rome if you can ignore all of that the series is actually really really good here is here's some of the preview for for Rome which is worth three watching if you in especially now you can get on like Amazon Prime and that means that if you are so if you're apt to do is I am and you just fast-forward right through those scenes and get to the good stuff the actual politics they claim proconsul Gaius Julius Caesar you've entered the city under arms the gods know my intentions of peace what you do by the spirits of My Ancestors I curse season so it's good it's really well done it's entertaining it's got some of the best characters in the one character named Titus Pullo is one of the better characters in TV history and kind of TV aficionados are big fans so check it out it's available via HBO via Amazon Prime on HBO or if you're an HBO subscriber so that's worth watching okay time for some things that I hate so now every corporation feels the necessity to get involved in politics at Levis is now pledging more than a million dollars to gun control organizations in an effort to curb the gun violence and the quote vary communities where we live and work one of the reasons why this is happening is because Nielsen numbers show that there are large numbers of people on the lefts want their corporations to be socially conscious people on the right we basically just go and buy what we want and most people buy what they want but there are a lot of people on the left we're like well I'm not gonna buy those jeans unless I feel good about it it's conspicuous consumption there are actual studies that show that people only buy Priuses because they look strange really if you go up to San Francisco there's a study it's probably five years ago there's the study and what it showed was that the Toyota Prius which looks like a weird bubble it's very ugly car and the honda hybrid civic which were which looks exactly like a normal car but gets exactly the same kind of electric gas mileage as the toyota prius the hybrid civic did not sell at all the prius sold a lot why because the real reason people were buying a Prius was not because it was energy-efficient because they didn't actually care what it did they just wanted to signal to all of their friends they cared about the environment it's like slapping a bumper sticker on your car well it's the same thing now with corporate brands so you're gonna see more and more of this preening from these various companies and then if the companies don't preen then they are going to be considered just awful terrible you know how dare they not kowtow to the social justice warriors everything is going to get more political not less political it's gonna get uglier before before it gets better okay other things that I hate so the President of the United States made some comments about the the current controversy in the Catholic Church and it is these comments are just foolish you made these comments to the Daily Caller I do have audio of it okay so here's what he said he said it's so sad to watch to me it's one of the saddest stories because I respect so much the Catholic Church and to me it's a very sad story which is correct but then he says that he was surprised Cardinal McCarrick and then he was asked about the Pope and he said the Pope is handling the crisis the best anyone can handle it the Pope is handling I get the best set anyone can handle it how is he going to handle it okay well no the Pope is not actually it's funny because you remember that Trump has attacked the Pope in the past right he actually went to war with the Pope over illegal immigration but when it comes to child molestation he's not willing to make a couple of comments about the Pope that seems sort of strange to me I don't understand why exactly he would not you know why he would not be calling for more from the Pope except that he just doesn't want that controversy if you're I understand not wanting the controversy but if you're going to engage with every political controversy Under the Sun it seems to me this would be a good place to put a little bit of weight okay final thing that I hate and then we'll do a quick Psalm for a little bit of uplift so beta O'Rourke who is not in fact Hispanic is a is a Texas senatorial candidate he's running against Ted Cruz and he's being upheld by the media as some sort of wunderkind he is he's going to bring decency and grace back to the national stage he's like white Barack Obama he actually is kept more like white young John Kerry yeah if you watch him he just he looks more like John Kerry his mannerisms are more like John Kerry he doesn't have the Boston accent otherwise he resembles John Kerry in a lot of ways he was on Ellen because this is what we do now you know Ellen she's a non-partisan guys stop it she's nonpartisan she just wants humor she just wants everybody to get along which is why she's gonna host a bunch of Republicans next thing you know except she never will she's gonna host better all right so here's better o'roarke talking about the national anthem protest and of course coming down on the side of people who protest the national anthem if this guy wins in Texas men the Republicans are in serious trouble but it's hard to think of a major or important or significant change that we've made as a country that wasn't painful that didn't require these these difficult conversations these unguarded moments with one another that ultimately produce change and progress in the right direction he is so exciting I understand what all the buzz is about oh the excitement but they say yeah well we'll have these conversations and they'll generate change in the right direction no they won't they won't I'm sorry people who aren't kneeling for the national anthem are generally not interested in a conversation which is why they are kneeling for the national anthem if they wanted to have an intelligent conversation about police regulations and police implementation of rules we could have that conversation in an intelligent way or theoretically we could just kneel for the anthem and pretend the entire country is in favor of police malfeasance okay time for a quick song so we have been going through a psalm a week we're up to Psalm number eight for the director of music Lord O Lord how majestic is your name in all the earth you set your glory in the heavens through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies to silence the foe and the Avenger and this is the part that's that's there are a couple of what we call sukham in Judaism in Hebrew which means verses when I consider your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which we have set in place what is mankind that you are mindful of them human beings that you care for them you've made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with honor and glory you have made them rulers over the works of your hands and you put everything under their feet this is why when people say that judeo-christian religion is all about kind of crushing mankind in the face of God that's really not what you do Christian religion is about at all right the psalms glorify man they say that God made us just a little bit lower than the angels which comes with a tremendous responsibility the creator of heaven and earth the force that stands behind the logic of the universe that force made you and that force expect something of you God expects something of you right he made us a little lower than the Angels and in some ways he in our in our creative capacity he made us higher the Angels because the Angels don't create right the angels are just emissaries when God suggests that we are a little lower than the angels and that we've been crowned with glory and honor and has made us rulers over the works right that comes with a responsibility it's not just about I think in Western civilization we've had too much on the side of man is glorious and therefore he should feel free to do whatever he wants and in guilt cultures shame cultures there's a difference I think that we are a guilt culture I think shame cultures have basically said that man is is mud and can be ground under people's feet for the sake of the collective we're somewhere in between right well we say is that man is capable being an angel a man is capable of being a worm but we have to make that decision and God has expectations of us one of the more beautiful of all the Psalms Psalm number eight God how majestic is your name in all the earth already we will be back here tomorrow with more of the absurdities of our daily politics plus the mailbag I'm Ben Shapiro this
