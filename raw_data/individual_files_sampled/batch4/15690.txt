I was on the Shoji one two three the Alberta website and it actually they come right out and say this isn't even developed for Albertans for Alberta children in conjunction with Alberta parents they come up right out and say that these are using resources that were developed in BC so it's a BC based program that that already didn't really consult with BC parents and now it's being rolled out in Alberta schools with zero consultation with Alberta parents and like you say how many parents don't even know that this is happening in their school yeah and what's the what's the secrecy why can't if they're so comfortable with what they're doing so why is the entire almost one thousand pages of communications between the Alberta government and those like the Art Foundation so G one two three in relation why are they all redacted what is the secrecy you know where's the transparency where's the accountability the other thing is if you go into the resources on that website for Alberta they're already in place here in Alberta they exist already in Alberta they're used in classrooms in Alberta mostly public school classrooms but they're optional resources and schools as far as I'm concerned if we really believe in choice should be able to develop resources that are cohesive cohesive to their own environment but the bottom line is that that's why we feel like there's something very fishy going on here that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
