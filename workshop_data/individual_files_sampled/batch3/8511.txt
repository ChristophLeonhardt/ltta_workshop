WE ARE LESS THAN A MONTH FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING OUR FOCUS ON THE SLOPPINESS OF CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. THIS TIME IT'S TO DEMOCRAT IN VITAL RACES. TONIGHT IT'S TENNESSEE AND INDIANA ON SWAMP WATCH. THIS KAVANAUGH INFORMATION SEEM TO HAVE FIRED UP MANY ON BOTH SIDES. ONE OF THEM WAS TAYLOR SWIFT WHO PLUNGED INTO THE FRAY WITH HER FIRST-EVER POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT. SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY VOTE FOR MARSHA BLACKBURN IN HER HOME STATE SENATE RACE, VOTE FOR DEMOCRAT PHIL BRINSON SHE TOLD HER INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS. DIDN'T ANYONE TELL HER ABOUT HIS RECORD ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THIS IN DORTMUND MIGHT END UP WITH TEARDROPS ON HER GUITAR. WHILE SERVING AS GOVERNOR OF TENNESSEE. WORSE THIS LOBBYIST WAS SUSPENDED FOR WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. WHEN LOCAL REPORTERS BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT THEY WERE SHOCKED TO FIND STATE INVESTIGATORS HAD LITERALLY SHREDDED ALL THE NOTES THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN DURING AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. THE TOP INVESTIGATOR REPORTEDLY ADMITTED TO BEING KEENLY AWARE THAT DOCUMENTATION WOULD HAVE BEEN LATER REQUESTED AS PUBLIC RECORD. THEY ARGUED IT WAS ALL PART OF AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIMS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS REALLY CARE UP THAT. JUST ASK DIANNE FEINSTEIN. THEN THE GOVERNOR TOLD REPORTERS UPTIME THERE'S NOTHING TO BE COVERED UP HERE BUT THEY SAID I DON'T HAVE ANY WAY OF PROVING THAT TO YOU. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. KIND OF HAVE TO. HE RESIGNED AMID SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS. THE GOVERNOR CONFIRMED A SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION FROM 2004 BUT SAID INVESTIGATORS FOUND NO CORROBORATION OF THE CLAIMS. GUESS WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE NOTES? THEY WERE SHREDDED TWO. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT DEMOCRATS WOULD'VE SAID IF THIS HAD HAPPENED WITH BRET CAVANAGH QUEST MARK OH, WE DIDN'T INVESTIGATION INTO CHRISTINE FORD'S ALLEGATION BUT WE CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THEM BECAUSE SOMEONE SHREDDED AND OUTSPREAD. SURELY THEY WOULD BE SHREDDING WHOEVER SAID THIS. AT THE TIME OF THE TENNESSEE STATE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL, SENIOR OFFICIAL OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM AND SAID ANYTIME YOU MIX MEN AND WOMEN TOGETHER IN A WORK ENVIRONMENT THERE'S GOING TO BE ISSUES. GREAT. GUESS WHO SAID THAT? NONE OTHER THAN TAYLOR SWIFT NEIL POLITICAL HEARTTHROB DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE PHIL BRUNSON. I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH HER GETTING POLITICAL BUT IF SHE'S GOING TO POSE AS A CHAMPION FOR WOMEN AND SUPPORT TO ME TOO MOVEMENT AND MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA FOR HER NOT TO ENDORSE MEN WHOSE MOTTO INCLUDES SHAKE IT OFF TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. AND JOE DONNELLY RUNNING FOR REELECTION AND INDIANA HAS REPEATEDLY CRITICIZED HIS OPPONENT OF A BUSINESS DEALING WITH CHINA. TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF DONNELLY'S CAMPAIGN ADS ON THE TOPIC. THIS IS MIKE'S GLOBAL NETWORK OF FOREIGN AUTO PARTS SUPPLIERS. HE USES FOREIGN WORKERS IN MEXICO, TAIWAN, ALL ACROSS CHINA CINA CHIA CHINA. IN A DEBATE HE TRIED TO HIDE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GET MADE. WE DISTRIBUTE THEM. COME ON, THIS IS YOUR COMPLETE WEBSITE. IT'S EVEN IN CHINESE. MORE THAN 200 FOREIGN SUPPLIERS CANNOT COME ON MIKE. HOW ABOUT COME ON JOE. YOU'D THINK THAT A CANDIDATE ATTACKING HIS OPPONENT FROM IMPORTING PRODUCTS IN CHINA WOULD NOT, IN FACT, HIMSELF BE IMPORTING PRODUCTS FROM CHINA. NO ONE CAN BE THAT STUPID AND HYPOCRITICAL, COULD THEY? OH DEAR. TURNS OUT SENATOR JOE DONNELLY HAS OWN SIGNIFICANT STAKES IN A FAMILY BUSINESS RUN BY HIS BROTHER, A COMPANY THAT HAS RECEIVED REPEATED SHIPMENTS OF GOODS FROM CHINA BETWEEN 2011 AND 2017. HIS BROTHER RECEIVED MORE THAN A HUNDRED 20000 POUNDS OF CHINESE MATERIAL SPREAD OUT ACROSS MORE THAN 20 SHIPMENTS. FINANCIAL RECORDS SHOW THAT DONNELLY COLLECTED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WORTH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 15 AND $50000 JUST IN 2016. SO SWAMP HE SENATOR JOE DONNELLY CRITICIZED HIS OPPONENT FOR MAKING MONEY FROM CHINESE IMPORTS AND THEN DOES EXACTLY THE SAME THING HIMSELF. WITH HYPOCRISY LIKE THAT, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU WILL
