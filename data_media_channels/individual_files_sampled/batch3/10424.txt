howdy max keiser this is the Kaiser report the award-winning document Falls to incorrigible journalists through the underbrush of truth Stacy would award has at one what you know when you put out there in the sky you just got to keep the propellers you know going is that one of those polls that you always run on Twitter where you're like hey which is the best show on the Internet is it Mac's Kaiser's Kaiser report is double down or I have the best Paul's on Twitter by far that's max keiser follow me on Twitter I'm trying to get the two hundred thousand followers only a few thousand yet to get to two hundred thousand if I get there I promised everyone that I will put out a huge shout out to everyone thanking them okay you know before I get into the headlines about interest rates rising in the United Kingdom I did want to get to this Bitcoin futures contract if you have any statement to make on it I notice that you're always making statements to people like coin desk and coin Telegraph and coin coin coin coin this and coin that calm but what about Kaiser report we should have exclusives here coin Telegraph is an excellent publication often quote me on these matters of importance now the CME the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be launching a futures contract on Bitcoin I think it's just launched you know when this is airing its launched and what does this mean it means many things it means that bitcoin is becoming accepted despite the negativity of the likes of Jamie Dimon and who's trying to keep the Bitcoin genie in the bottle because he as he said himself it's gonna eat our lunch he's right this disintermediate s the need for a bank like JPMorgan but despite that he couldn't convince the CMA to not list this futures contract and you've got a huge schism in the banking community now those who want to cling to the old ways the fees the larceny the drug-running and those who are ready to embrace the future of frictionless transactions very little fees and instantaneous you know non settlement dates like our friend Patrick Byrne at overstock.com who's leading the pack he's gonna put the nearest anyway I'm getting to the point I feel like saying what about the point yeah what do I point get to the point you're drooling you like the price the price just give me the price action and I'm sure about the facts the figures the economics the architecture the price discovery mechanism just give me the price you're like a price junkie you're on there like give me the price I want the price okay so what what about the futures contract that one of the CMA guys I forget his name right now but he came out and said actually bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency it is a new asset class so what will a futures contract what is a futures contract what will it do to the price and to the asset class called Bitcoin this new asset class will it some people have been tweeting me asking me for your opinion about what will happen in terms of like we know that the futures market for gold and silver we know that it's caused you know there are naked shorts there you mentioned Patrick Burnett overstock.com has a new to t0 platform where basically you won't be able to do net naked shorts so what do you think about a futures contract in terms of what will they be able to do naked shorting now that it's it's not they don't have to deliver any Bitcoin it's just they have to deliver more paper so can it cause price action like a pressuring down can it do that okay you make a point there about it being cash settled in dollars and not in Bitcoin so like the silver and gold market in their futures contracts that's used to keep the price cheap keep the price low by using naked shorts in the paper market so is that a risk yes it is what will be the mitigating factor to thwart the evil banksters and their naked shorts will be overwhelming demand yes because as the banking system you see this is the Trojan horse as Bitcoin becomes more accepted banks are collapsing their ability to get themselves bail by the Fed is winnowing because there's only so many dollars that Fed can print before they put the entire dollar fiat currency matrix at risk and so they're out of there out of runway the banks are sitting on balance sheets that are insolvent every single major bank in the world is technically insolvent they cannot pay the debts they will never pay their debts and if the Fed stops giving them free money they will all declare insolvency immediately therefore the demand for Bitcoin no matter how many fricking make it shorts they stick out there is gonna kill the naked shorts and that's why it's important for everyone like I'm talking to you Indian people in India forget gold Gold's it's not helping you get open a Bitcoin wallet start buying Bitcoin there any gold buy Bitcoin and this will help us defeat the banksters the banking terrorists the evildoers like Jamie Dimon Lloyd Blankfein and the rest actually I saw a chart the latest out about the average consumption of gold per capita and Germans are the biggest buyers of gold well of course the people of India the Germans are biggest per capita yes yeah they like to buy big bars and go oh let's stick it there safe and go down and put their lederhosen on and drink a few beers at the Oktoberfest and talk about other gold bullion but the Indian people they're not like this or buying like a $20 chatzky at the market to prove that they're worthy to be married or whatever a trade a couple of goats but they need to get rid of that whole gold based economy and moved over to crypto they you know dare drop a billion phones on to the continent of India so they can get those wallets going like Africa Africa zooming ahead Africa is gonna be a crypto powerhouse Africa is gonna be the 21st century winner in the crypto world because they're already on the mobile phone they're already exchanging and dealing on crypto currencies they're already lightyears ahead of America Europe India it's Africa baby that's why I'm thinking about moving to Africa because I want to be part of the revolution in Africa okay but let's move to the United Kingdom this is the nation of much debt and one obsession only what does bit what does Britain do but housing bubbles everybody there no matter what you try to do no business exists except for the property ladder that's the only story nothing else no other financial story no other business can you set up there and no conversation can you have that it doesn't lead to the property market that's not a British person to say you know your family was just kidnapped they've been set on fire your yacht has been burnt to the crisp and you know you've just been discovered to have herpes it'll be like well how does this affect my property well this made my house go up in value that's all they think about yes and if you ever have lived in Los Angeles like you and I have separately you know everybody there from your waiter to your doctor to everybody has a pitch they're selling they're selling some script they have some script they're working and some still one industry town so one industry town the entire you living there separately by choice we have met separated separated different time periods timeline was different time periods like a different era I was living there in the 19th century you were living there in 20th so let's turn to this headline here about the United Kingdom because you know over the past week they did raise interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25 percent so interest rate rise to cause some pain says Bank deputy the rise in UK interest rates will cause some pain for homeowners but should be kept in contacts the Bank of England deputy governor has said Ben Broadbent told the BBC that the rise announced last Thursday was moderate and that interest payments on debt were still at record lows this is the the more interesting stuff is what comes in the context and the content of these stories because first of all they highlight that it's the first rate hike in 10 years which is remarkable right it also says that only 4 million households in the United Kingdom face higher mortgage interest rates because it's only actually 30% of households have a mortgage on their property most people have like they own their property outright in the United Kingdom after decades of living in it well the ECB's I can help them bail out these banks because they did the whole break so the ECB is going to thumb their nose at Mark Carney Bank of England in the UK and say you deal with the inflation that you now inherit it because you're so freakin stupid to vote out of the biggest trade bloc in the world and try to go it alone even though that 16 percent of your GDP depends on trade with EU verses like 7% for EU versus the UK they went to a gun fight not with a knife with a wet noodle I mean they got more wet noodles than Harvey Weinstein at a car wash and they trying to get this interest rate policy sorted they'll never get the interest rate policy sorted because they kept it low they engage in financial repression to keep Barclays HSBC Lloyd's RBS for insolvent banks for insolvent banks keep them from declaring insolvency because we're aristocrats and we don't Q to the law we don't need to participate in society because Margaret Thatcher said there is no Society so we're the four big banks in the UK and we don't have to obey the law and even though we're sitting on hundreds of billions of pounds of unpayable debt we just cranked out the money from Mark Carney in the Bank of England and now they went brexit and you'll be like and now they're gonna have to declare insolvency they're gonna need IMF money within five years in the UK I predict I predict within five years they're gonna to bail out because they're so stupid they get a little a little Georgie guy hi I'm Georgie I'll be the King make him this chairman of the Bank of England and you'll have the same results as having some frickin dirt bag like Marconi okay so the remarkable things I'm going to talk to you about this was the first interest rate rise in ten years so ten years the economy is still just struggling ten years they need the free money on top of this the article from the BBC points out savers will see a modest lift in their returns although Barclays HSBC Lloyds and Lloyds are yet to announce they will pass the full rise so increase their fees yeah okay there's a chubby sabola Bank okay okay okay sorry that's just the truth so let's move on to the next headline because this is a headline so they they're they haven't announced whether or not they'll pass on the full rise to their customers we know of course they won't pass on the full rise to their customers because they never pass on the cuts to their customers on the other side in terms of their credit cards the credit card interest rates are still up at fifteen to twenty five percent so let's look back however I want to turn to the fact of one of our frequent guests here on Kaiser report is Steve Kean he's a heterodox economists not as a mode option well sexual yes he's not in the mainstream he's he's told you here on the Kaiser report that what matters most to the stability of the financial system is the rate of increase of debt and the household sector so this is an article from The Guardian just a few days before the interest rate cut rise surge in UK consumer borrowing fuels likely interest rate rise the pace of annual consumer credit growth was nine point nine percent last month according to figures from the central bank as borrowing and credit cards overdraft and unsecured loans jumped this is part of the reason why they increased interest rates by 25 basis points but remarkably this was down from the year before when the annual growth rate of unsecured credit was 12% yeah stagflation and you know it's a nightmare and what I'm loving it they are all idiots well we gotta go to the break don't go away stay right there welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to return to our guest Dave column he's a professor at Cornell University who writes a yearly u review at peak prosperity in Zero Hedge we'll get to that in a moment Dave welcome back hey thanks for having me back for a second segment you two they leave me at the curb yeah haha well Dave we were chatting you have an interesting resume you've combined your interest in science organic chemistry or hard science you're also well-known for your observations in the economics failed something of a soft science like psychology or sociology so my first question has to do when these two worlds collide for example Oh going back to the long-term capital management crisis you had a bunch of quants you know mathematicians and smarty guys who took a very hard science approach to money management that they had figured out risk and they were absolutely going to beat the rich you know and they wouldn't deliver these outsized returns and then of course they blew up spectacularly because they didn't understand the psychology of markets it's not a fair characterization what are your thoughts on that we know that the long-term capital management guys fall into the category of it loosely I actually just wrote a chunk on this called good hearts law where it basically says anytime something becomes popular no longer is useful it's more specific than that but I use it that loosely and so these guys I think got a good idea and then they leveraged it up so much they became the market at some level and the same thing happened with you know you remember the old Janus tech funds where they were owning you know thirty percent of calm so they couldn't liquidate their their positions if they wanted to and so actually I think this year the topic du jour is to talk about how indexing has now become an example of good hearts law least that's the argument I'm gonna make this year is that it was a great idea that now is too popular and become a bad idea potential or now when I was working on Wall Street in the 80s we had something called portfolio insurance which meant that people could buy stocks with a reckless abandon and have very little downside because the portfolio's were insured and then you had the crash of 1987 when that whole model broke down and you didn't hear about that for a while the current market is trading at you know above 23,000 on the Dow there's a belief out there that risk management is very robust and that we can't won't see any significant downside anytime soon what are your thoughts there yeah that's a crock so great stories coming out of guys like Jessie Felder and a guy named Steve Bregman who I didn't know until this year you look at something like the triple Q or the Russell 2000 and they have reported price earnings ratios of 20 25 you know well okay for growth companies that's not a bad price what Bragman points out what others have pointed out is that the way they get to a average p/e of 23 is they take any stock above 40 and they round it down to 40 and eight and he stuck with an earnings that's that are negative they rounded to 40 and then Bregman does this great math Reese's if you take the whole market cap and all the earnings of the the triple Q you get a p/e m87 which means which means that you're being lied to so that's a pretty bad valuation and if you use various Tobin's Q and you know market to GDP price to GDP and stuff like that we're approximately two fold overvalued in my opinion and if we regress to the mean that'll cause damage that will destroy pensions that'll destroy retirements if we regress through the mean which my understanding of math says you got to spend after your time below the mean it'll be a it'll be a come-to-jesus moment for most investors refresh my memory triple Q again is that's the the tech index hundred hundred big tech stocks and and the the P gets reported by the parent company whose name escapes me right now but but so they basically commit what looks like from a physical science perspective is fraud they're just making it up as they go well once again Dave we have a problem with the Federal Reserve Bank that is allowing corporations to borrow and virtually no money whatsoever and make these huge acquisitions or buy back their own stock and boost earnings artificially a practice that used to be illegal for obvious reasons that's now been legal see and the mergers and acquisitions are a bit out of control so a company like Amazon can buy whole foods and it's a creative that cost is zero for funds is zero it goes immediately to the bottom line they pay the market cap of the company goes up more than the acquisition price so you've got this inversion of the capitalist tenants where the risk seems to be borne by entirely by one segment of society and then you've got folks like Jeff Bezos who's it has no exposure to risk whatsoever he's just printing money essentially at this point and becoming an out-of-control oligopolist your thoughts well you know for those who like trivia it turns out the share buybacks were enabled dramatically back by a decision made in 84 that excluded buybacks from a rule that said you're not allowed to manipulate share price but you can buy back shares and so so now you know executives boost their end-of-the-year bonuses by buying back shares what the average investor seems to not understand is that while you are buying back shares you're usually rotting the balance sheet and people see some low p/e which is a stupidly simple number right it's it's a blunt ended tool that I no longer use actually and what they don't notice is that there's you know 30 40 billion dollars of debt lurking on the balance sheet and so it's kind of a leveraged buyout by the creditors at some point the creditors own the whole company and and they're it's basically a financial engineering to make everything look good to keep your job as a CEO and and so this will come to an end right earnings are actually going down when you strip out the effects of share repurchases so those PE ratios are wildly under stated so now Dave you do a annual wrap-up for the markets and do a bit of an outlook for the for the next year I think last year you were pretty positive on gold and negative on stocks if I'm if I have that correct that that was not necessarily a great timing on that what what's that what's your current feeling and my current feeling is that the people who are pessimistic near the end of a market cycle look like idiots and that the closer you get to the end the harder it is on those who are pessimists I actually bleep no.9 was warranted if if if you look at the valuations two no.9 we regress to but not through the mean and that's thanks to an estimated 20 to 30 trillion dollars of backstop by central banks and I've asked many many smart people did anyone predict that level of intervention a lot of people predicted the crisis no one saw that level of intervention coming and so right now I think that we Bears will be catcalled to the point of insanity until we're right and then then ironically once we're right it'll be so much blood in the street that they be able to gloat because because it will be an unseemly mess that's an interesting number there Dave you saying that the fed backstop 20 to 30 trillion meaning that the initial tarp bailout money of 700 billion that we were told kind of expanded it went to between 20 and 30 trillion to bail out the bankers depending on how you account for it the reason that's an interesting number is that the social tax network or the Tax Justice Network in the UK published a study recently that suggested there's between 20 and 30 trillion dollars held offshore not being taxed and for this reason you have all in it that's all coming out in these scandals the Paradise Papers the Panama papers so in other words how can we really even begin to offer number like GDP inflation growth employment when two times America's GDP is held offshore invisible untaxed controlled by these banks and there's a whole parallel universe out there money that that no one's really paying attention to except those that are benefitting wildly from having untaxed wealth appreciate in these spectacular gains again untaxed Dave well you know if you look at America if you call it America's GDP the question I would ask is that if it is an American domiciled company but that all the manufacturing and all the employment all the production is offshore does it really matter that it's an American based company I would argue that that whatever country is doing providing the goods and services and making the products that's the country that's benefiting from it so I'm a little reluctant to consider those multinationals as American right a fair point the companies can have their taxes applied in one country they can have their labor outsourced to another country they can have their marketing in a third country and we know about all this kind of Massah nations that go on in corporations - absolutely game the global markets in a way that is only available to transnationals multinationals and not available to the individual but I'm talking about a hidden thirty potentially thirty trillion dollar cache of wealth that is not being taxed that is being managed by the likes of HSBC Barclays Goldman Sachs JP Morgan on behalf of a approximately two hundred thousand people that are making a mockery of the global economy and and essentially stoking an insurrection stoking violence by laughing in the face of these groups around the world that they've stolen from Dave well you know I agree and and I think that again the central bank interventions cause this disparity if you look at that compensation for the high executives compared to the the average schmuck in the factory that those numbers are sword at some point you end up in a lot of meat cake moment I think and that this part of the underlying anger on college campuses as part of an teef as part of its part of its part of all the mishaps that we're seeing who knows if you can blame some of the shooting on it I so so what we're seeing is this is a system that is being shaken dangerously by an increasing sense on the part of the proletariat that that that it's not fair now now there have always been people down the chain that they weren't paid a lot but I think the sense of fairness is does move around and I think right now there's a real sense of unfairness and it does even matter if it if it's true the perception of unfairness will cause us going forward which is why Trump's president right everyone said screw it I'm I'm voting against the system it was a bipartisan throw the bums out moment for for electing Trump right now I'm talking about Trump and talking about the Fed it looks like he'll be in a position to appoint up to five FOMC central banking members soon how do you see that playing out we've got about 20 seconds it'll blow it and what way he'll put a bunch of money printers in the Fed oh okay so it's Dow Jones 40,000 at least all right Dave thanks so much for being on the Kaiser report thank you Oh all right well that's gonna do it for this edition of the cut as a report with me Max Keiser and Stacy ever I'd like to thank our guest Dave Cole he's a professor at Cornell he's got great videos on YouTube check them out do you want to catch us on YouTube our selves this cause the report until next time bye Oh
