1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:03,491
UPCOMING MEETING WITH KIM

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:03,858
JONG-UN.

3
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,927
GLAD YOU ARE WITH US, TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:09,764
BREAKING NEWS OPENING MONOLOGUE.

5
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:12,434
HUGE DEVELOPMENTS TONIGHT.

6
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,269
THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY, RUDY

7
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,570
GUILIANI WILL JOIN US.

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,907
HE IS TELLING THE NEW YORK TIMES

9
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:20,975
THAT SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT

10
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,710
MUELLER IS AGREEING TO LIMIT THE

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,180
SCOPE OF THE QUESTIONS AND THE

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,549
NEW YORK CITY MAYOR IS SAYING IT

13
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,417
COULD RESULT IN A POSSIBLE JULY

14
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,352
INTERVIEW AND MUELLER ISSUING

15
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:33,688
A FINAL REPORT BY LABOR DAY AND

16
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:34,956
THE MID- TERM ELECTION.

17
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:37,625
THAT WOULD BE A WIN FOR THE

18
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:38,493
PRESIDENTS.

19
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:39,861
MUELLER'S ORIGINAL QUESTIONS

20
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:42,163
WERE RIDICULOUS AND A PERJURY

21
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:44,599
TRAP AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING.

22
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,134
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE WAS

23
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:48,570
THINKING AND TODAY IS THE ONE

24
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,239
YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE MUELLER

25
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:51,806
WITCH HUNT.

26
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,742
AND SO FAR THERE IS NOT A SINGLE

27
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:56,411
SHRED OF EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION

28
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,546
AND THAT IS NOT AGAINST THE LAW.

29
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:00,315
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS SO

30
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:02,584
ABUSIVE AND CORRUPT AND SO

31
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,452
CONFLICTED THAT THE PRESIDENT

32
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:07,288
AND HIS LEGAL TEAM ARE RIGHTLY

33
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:10,658
GOING TO OFFENSE TO SOLICIT THE

34
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,328
DEEP STATE TEAM.

35
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:14,329
CONGRATULATIONS, THE PRESIDENT

36
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:14,829
TWEETED.

37
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,898
WE ARE IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE

38
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:19,934
GREATEST WITCH HUNT IN HISTORY

39
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:22,403
AND NO COLLUSION OR OBSTRUCTION.

40
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:24,539
ONLY COLLUSION IS DONE BY THE

41
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:27,609
DEMOCRATS WHO WERE UNABLE TO WIN

42
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,977
THE ELECTION DESPITE THE

43
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:31,813
SPENDING OF FAR MORE MONEY.

44
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:35,250
>> ALL MULLER IS TRYING TO DO IS

45
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,286
TO GET PAUL MANAFORT TO FLIP AND

46
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:43,558
BRINGING UP TAX CHARGES FROM

47
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:46,261
2005 AND 7 AND IT HAS NOTHING TO

48
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:48,263
DO WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

49
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:50,999
LOOK AT MUELLER'S EMBARRASSING

50
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:52,967
CASE AGAINST THE RUSSIAN BOUGHT

51
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:53,368
COMPANIES.

52
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:55,169
THAT IS FALLING APART.

53
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:58,339
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE WITH ALL OF

54
00:01:58,339 --> 00:01:59,641
THESE GREAT ATTORNEYS LIKE

55
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:04,212
ANDREW WEISSMAN HE INDICTED

56
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:08,416
A COMPANY THAT DIDN'T EXIST AT

57
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,717
THE TIME.

58
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:12,287
AND HE TOLD CONGRESS THAT HE

59
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:14,556
DIDN'T THINK MICHAEL FLYNN.

60
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:16,357
THERE IS SOMETHING OFF WITH WHAT

61
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:18,159
IS HAPPENING TO GENERAL FLYNN.

62
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,029
IT IS A ABUSE OF POWER AND

63
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,830
UNLIKE ANYTHING THE COUNTRY HAS

64
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,267
BEEN SEEING AND THE MEDIA IS

65
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:26,568
MIA.

66
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:29,170
IT IS COSTING THE AMERICAN TAX

67
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,472
WARDS UPWARDS OF $10 MILLION.

68
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:34,842
AND BECAUSE OF ALL OF THESE

69
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:35,977
FACTS, THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL

70
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,979
TEAM IS NO LONGER SITTING BACK

71
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,748
AND WATCHING MUELLER AND THE

72
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:43,084
DEEP STATE OPERATIVES AND

73
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:44,819
WATCHING IT UNFOLD.

74
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,156
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IS NO LONGER

75
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:53,294
CONSIDERING TO INDICTING THE

76
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:54,095
PRESIDENT.

77
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:56,431
& ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

78
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:58,299
THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL

79
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,168
PRECEDENT TO EVEN CONSIDER THIS.

80
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:03,071
THEY ARE LONG ESTABLISHED DOJ

81
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,073
GUIDELINE AND WE EXPLAINED THOSE

82
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,741
IN PLACE.

83
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:08,810
AND FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR

84
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,646
RUDY GUILIANI POINTED OUT THAT

85
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:13,948
MUELLER MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ISSUE

86
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:16,050
A SUPPENA BECAUSE THE

87
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,518
PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM HANDED

88
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:20,989
OVER A MILLION DOCUMENTS AND

89
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,657
MUELLER HAS EVERYTHING

90
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:23,057
REQUESTED.

91
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:27,428
AND THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE A.

92
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:30,164
AND THAT IS A DIRECT THREAT TO

93
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:32,233
THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC.

94
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,534
MUELLER IS CALLING DAMAGE TO AT

95
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,269
THIS TIME RULE OF LAW IN THIS

96
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:38,272
COUNTRY AND THE NEW YORK TIMES

97
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:39,407
CONFIRMING ALL OF THE REPORTING

98
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:40,908
THAT WE HAD OVER THE YEAR AND

99
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:44,145
PART OF IT IS THE OBAMA FBI DID

100
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:48,149
IN FACT HAVE A MOLE INSIDE OF

101
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:50,818
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

102
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,120
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT

103
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,355
THE NEW YORK TIMES DIDN'T DO IT

104
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:55,223
ON PURPOSE.

105
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:58,660
THEY SUDDENLY DECIDED TO TELL

106
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,262
THE TRUTH FOR ONCE?

107
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:05,800
THIS WAS NOT A SIMPLE

108
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,835
AND THE ONLY REASON TO BURY THE

109
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:09,904
LEAD OF THE STORY AND TRYING TO

110
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:11,572
SPIN AND COVER UP FOR THOSE

111
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:13,107
PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER

112
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:15,143
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR, THOSE WHO

113
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:17,345
ARE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THE

114
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:18,046
ILLICIT ACTIVITY.

115
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:20,515
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW, THE DEEP

116
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:23,885
STATE KNOWS THEY ARE ABOUT TO

117
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:24,285
EXPOSE.

118
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,255
WE ARE EXPECTING THE IG REPORT

119
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:30,258
AND WE'LL SEE THE 1.2 MILLION

120
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:32,160
DOCUMENTS THAT THE IG LOOKED AT.

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,795
AND IT IS OBVIOUS AND

122
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:34,228
TRANSPARENT.

123
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:36,731
THEY ARE LEAKING INFORMATION TO

124
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:43,004
GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE

125
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,773
AND THAT IS STORMY, STORMY.

126
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,744
AND THE DOJ IS TRYING TO LEAK

127
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:52,146
THE INFORMATION TO FRIENDLY

128
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,348
MEDIA.   THE NEW YORK TIMES IS

129
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:57,085
NO ONE FRIENDLIER.

130
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,020
AND REMEMBER THEY BROKE THE

131
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,389
STORY THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

132
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,292
GET AHEAD OF DEVIN NUNNES.

133
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:07,128
AND THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT

134
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:07,929
SOUND OFF.

135
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,664
WE KNEW ABOUT THIS.

136
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:10,765
REMEMBER CONGRESS HASN'T BEEN

137
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:16,804
ABLE TO SEE THE INFORMATION,

138
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:21,943
WHY?

139
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:26,681
AND THAT IS RIGHTLY.

140
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,783
AND THAT IS THE NEW YORK TIMES

141
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:29,150
REPORT.

142
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,021
AND THE FBI OBTAINED AND THE

143
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,190
SECRET TYPE OF SUBPEONA.

144
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,727
AND AT LEAST ONE GOVERNMENT

145
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:45,032
INFORMANT MET WITH CARTER PAGE.

146
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:48,669
AND SO WE HAVE A SECRET TYPE OF

147
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:54,008
SUBPEONA AND THE OBAMA USED TO

148
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:57,945
SPY ON THE CAMPAIGN.

149
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:03,584
AND IT IS IN THREE SUBSEQUENT

150
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:05,186
APPLICATION AND DOSZIER PUT

151
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:06,654
TOGETHER BY A FOREIGN NATIONAL

152
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,556
TO GET A WARRANT AND TO SPY ON

153
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,091
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

154
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,393
YOU ARE KEEPING UP WITH ME HERE?

155
00:06:12,393 --> 00:06:14,061
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF

156
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:14,428
AMERICA.

157
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:16,731
YOU HAVE ALL OF THE TOP PEOPLE.

158
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:19,901
DOY, AND FBI AND NOT RACHG AND

159
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:22,703
FILE MAKING SURE THEY HAD EVERY

160
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,906
BASE OF THEIRS COVERED BECAUSE

161
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,108
THEIR GOAL WAS TO GET TRUMP BY

162
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:31,145
ANY MEANS NECESSARY AFTER THEY

163
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:34,448
HELPED HILLARY RIG THE

164
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:35,016
INVESTIGATION.

165
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,083
EXXONERATION BEFORE

166
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:36,584
INVESTIGATION.

167
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:39,587
AND FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR,

168
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:42,256
RUDY GUILIANI, SAID THIS COULD

169
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,926
BLOW UP THE ENTIRE MUELLER

170
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:45,393
INVESTIGATION.

171
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:48,062
>> IN THIS CASE, WE'LL HAVE TO

172
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:51,799
CHALLENGE THE LEJETIMACY OF THE

173
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,500
ENTIRE INVESTIGATION.

174
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,602
MAYBE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR OR

175
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:56,237
COUNSEL SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

176
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:56,637
APPOINTED.

177
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:58,840
AND NOT BASED ON A SET OF THE

178
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,074
FACTS THAT GO BACK TO.

179
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:02,276
I AM SHOCKED TO HEAR THEY PUT

180
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,112
A SPY IN THE CAMPAIGN OF A MAJOR

181
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:07,048
PARTY CANDIDATE OR MAYBE TWO

182
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,150
SPIES AND NOW, YOU KNOW, I WAS

183
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,452
A PART OF THAT CAMPAIGN AND I AM

184
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:13,721
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS THE

185
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:14,021
SPY.

186
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:16,757
IS IT THIS PURPOSE OR THAT

187
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:17,158
PERSON.

188
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:21,195
IF IT IS A SPY, THEY GOT NOTHING

189
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:22,530
FROM IT.

190
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,465
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING THE

191
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:28,069
CASE RIGHT NOW IF THEY HAD

192
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,770
INCRIMINATING INFORMATION.

193
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,838
>> Sean: HERE IS ANOTHER PIECE

194
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,306
OF INFORMATION FROM THE NEW YORK

195
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,507
TIMES ARTICLE.

196
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:36,244
AND HAVE DAYS AFTER THEY CLOSED

197
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,346
THE INVESTIGATION AND THE

198
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:39,914
ILLEGAL USE OF THE PRIVATE

199
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:45,453
E-MAIL SERVER AND THE ONES THAT

200
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:45,603
HELP

201
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:46,053
HEL

202
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:50,625
HELPED TO EXANERATE HILLARY.

203
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,526
AND THAI THEN THEY SCRUTINIZED

204
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:54,595
THE CAMPAIGN OF HER REPUBLICAN

205
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:54,929
RIVAL.

206
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,665
THEY PUT THE FIX IN AND

207
00:07:57,665 --> 00:07:59,100
EXONERATED HILLARY CLINTON AND

208
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,904
WE KNOW SHE COMMITTED FELONY.

209
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:04,639
AND WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE.

210
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,342
AND DAYS LATER, THEY WENT AFTER

211
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:09,143
DONALD TRUMP.

212
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:10,778
THEY THOUGHT THEY KNEW BETTER

213
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:11,946
THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

214
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:13,214
THAT MEANS YOU.

215
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:16,684
AND IF ALL OF THAT IS NOT

216
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:17,051
ENOUGH.

217
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:21,255
THERE IS SEVERS IMPLICATIONS AND

218
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:24,091
TOP AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL AND THEY

219
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,227
BROKE WITH PROTOCOL AND ALLOWED

220
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:31,699
THE AMBASSADOR TO SIT FOR A FBI

221
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,568
INTERVIEW TO DESCRIBE HIS

222
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:40,408
INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE

223
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:40,875
PAPADOPOULOS.

224
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,844
AND THAT MEANS OBAMA HAD TO KNOW

225
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:44,946
FROM DAY ONE.

226
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:47,348
AND THAT MEANS THE OBAMA WHITE

227
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:49,116
HOUSE HAD TO SIGN OFF ON IT FROM

228
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:49,717
DAY ONE.

229
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,820
NO ONE ELSE IN THE MEDIA IS

230
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,088
REPORTING THIS.

231
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:57,825
THERE GOES WAY BEYOND COMEY AND

232
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:03,431
TOP LEVEL FBI AND DOJ DEEP STATE

233
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:05,333
AGITATORS.

234
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,536
OBAMA AND JOHN KERRY NEED TO

235
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:10,604
EXPLAIN WHAT THEY KNOW AND WHEN

236
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:11,806
DID THEY KNOW IT?

237
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:14,175
THERE IS NO WAY THAT WOULD HAVE

238
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,576
HAPPENED WITHOUT THEIR APPROVAL.

239
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:18,412
AND THE DOJ AND IG REPORT THAT

240
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:20,281
WE JUST MENTIONED WHEN WE COME

241
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:20,681
OUT.

242
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:24,352
AND SARAH CARTER BREAKING NEWS,

243
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:27,822
A DRAFT OF THE HIGHLY

244
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:28,489
ANTICIPATED REPORT OF THE

245
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:32,193
HANDLING OF THE EMAIL

246
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,428
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN SENT TO

247
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,663
CONGRESS.

248
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:37,732
FINALLY 14 OR 15 MONTHS.

249
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:40,301
IT IS EXTREMELY LONG AND

250
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:40,701
THOROUGH.

251
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:44,071
SARAH IS ALSO REPORTING THAT IT

252
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,307
DOES NOT CONTAIN REFERRALS.

253
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,275
THAT WOULD COME IN THE LIKE THE

254
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,712
CASE WAS ANDREW McCABE.

255
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:54,215
AND COMES WITH ONE SMALL TASK TO

256
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:55,049
PAY ATTENTION TO.

257
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,852
FOX NEWS REPORTING THAT THE FBI

258
00:09:57,852 --> 00:09:59,320
AND DOJ HAVE IT.

259
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,989
AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO REVIEW

260
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,127
THE IG'S DRAFT AND THAT MEANS

261
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,695
THEY WILL MAYBE OFFER INSTANCES

262
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:10,498
TO REDACT INFORMATION AND THAT

263
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:12,900
MEANS THE DEEP STATE WOULD BE

264
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,870
ABLE TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE

265
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,203
TRUTH.

266
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:19,206
THIS IS WHY ROD ROSENSTEIN AND

267
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,208
THE DOJ'S MO.

268
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,978
THEY STONE WALL AND WHEN THAT

269
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:27,448
DOESN'T WORK THEY REDACT UNDER

270
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:30,618
THE NATIONAL GUISE OF NATIONAL

271
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:31,018
SECURITY.

272
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,553
EVERYTHING THEY HAVE REDAUKT

273
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:35,556
DAKT SO FAR IS NOT NATIONAL

274
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:35,956
SECURITY.

275
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:38,659
BUT EMBARRASSING DETAILS LIKE

276
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:44,198
JAMES COMEY AND THE FBI DIDN'T

277
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:47,701
THINK MIKE FLYNN LIED.

278
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,703
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY ARE

279
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:51,872
NOT CAPABLE MUCH HOMING

280
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:54,742
THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE AND THE

281
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,710
INSPECTORS GENERAL NEEDS TO HOLD

282
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,946
FIRM ON HIS REPORT TONIGHT.

283
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:01,048
ROBERT MUELLER TURNED OVER THE

284
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:03,818
SCOPE MEMO OF HIS INVESTIGATION

285
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:06,153
TO FEDERAL JUDGE TRNGS S ELLIS

286
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:06,854
THE THIRD.

287
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:16,597
AND ANDREW WEISSMAN, HE WENT

288
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,399
AFTER MUELLER'S TEAM.

289
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,235
AND THEY WENT AFTER PAUL

290
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,470
MANAFORT.

291
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,071
2005 ALREADY INVESTIGATED TAX

292
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,806
FRAUD ISSUE THAT HAD NOTHING TO

293
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:29,577
DO WITH THE ELECTION OR CAMPAIGN

294
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:31,645
OR RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

295
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,647
THE SAME JUDGE BLASTING THE

296
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:35,382
MUELLER TEAM TRYING TO GET

297
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:36,484
MANAFORT TO FLIP.

298
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:39,520
THEY WANT TO PUT THE SCREWS TO

299
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,356
HIM AND MAKE HIM SING SO THEY

300
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:44,725
CAN PROSECUTE OR IMPEACH

301
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:45,326
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

302
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:49,096
AND ONE OF THE MOST A GREJOUS

303
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:52,333
EXAMPLES OF MEDIA BIAS.

304
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,768
THE PRESS CLAIMING THAT

305
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:56,804
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED ILLEGAL

306
00:11:56,804 --> 00:11:58,105
IMMIGRANTS ANIMALS.

307
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,141
IT WAS NOT THE CASE.

308
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:03,077
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC

309
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:05,112
MEMBERS OF THE MS13 GAMES.

310
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,648
THEY KNOWINGLY, AND PURPOSELY

311
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:10,351
TOOK THE PRESIDENT OUT OF

312
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:14,288
CONTEXT TO TRY TO SMEAR HIM YET

313
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:14,788
AGAIN.

314
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:18,192
NEWS MEDIA, JOURNALISM IN

315
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:20,027
AMERICA IS DEAD.

316
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,429
AND THIS SHAMEFUL MEDIA

317
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:22,963
COVERAGE.

318
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:24,732
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS POSING

319
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:26,667
AS NEWS IN THE UNITED STATES.

320
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,536
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

321
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:31,672
STATES HAS TO MEASURE HIS WORLDS

322
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:33,274
AND BE MORE CAREFUL.

323
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:36,510
IT IS SLIPPERY SLOPE WHEN YOU

324
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,778
DEHUMANIZE PEOPLE THIS WAY.

325
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:40,648
IT IS WHAT THE NAZIS DID AND NOT

326
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:46,720
WHAT AMERICAN INS DO.

327
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,822
>> THE PRESIDENT CALLED PEOPLE

328
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:49,190
ANIMALS.

329
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,759
>> THAT WAS IN A WHITE HOUSE

330
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,528
MEETING ON SANCTUARY CITIES AND

331
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:56,931
SOMEONE REMARKED ABOUT MS 13

332
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,332
GANG MEMBERS.

333
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:01,202
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T MAKE IT

334
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:03,537
CLEAR IF IT IS GANG MEMBERS AND

335
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:09,043
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SAY IT IS

336
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:11,111
DOWN RIGHT DANGEROUS LANGUAGE.

337
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:12,846
>> Sean: WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT

338
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:13,414
ACTUALLY SAY?

339
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:16,717
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE VICIOUS

340
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:19,453
GANG KNOWN AS MS 13.

341
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,288
TAKE A LOOK.

342
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:26,994
>> MS 13 GANG MEMBER.

343
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:29,296
IF THEY DON'T TELL ICE ABOUT

344
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:29,630
THEM?

345
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,099
>> WE HAVE PEOPLE TRYING TO COME

346
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:32,466
IN.

347
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,835
WE ARE TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE

348
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:35,202
COUNTRY.

349
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:36,337
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD

350
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:37,338
THEY ARE.

351
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:38,539
THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE.

352
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:39,974
THEY ARE ANIMALS.

353
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:42,009
AND WE ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF

354
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:45,980
THE COUNTRY AT A LEVEL AND RATE

355
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,648
THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

356
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,750
AND BECAUSE OF THE WEAK LAWS,

357
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,452
THEY COME IN FAST AND WE GET

358
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:53,454
THEM AND RELEASE THEM.

359
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:55,889
AND GET THEM AGAIN.

360
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:58,359
WE GET THEM OUT AND IT'S CRAZY.

361
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,893
>> Sean: AND THE PRESIDENT

362
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,029
RESPONDED TO THE ABUSIVELY

363
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:02,963
BIASSED MEDIA.

364
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,499
>> YOU KNOW I AM REFERRING TO

365
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,735
THE MS 13 GANGS THAT ARE COMING

366
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:10,371
IN AND TALKING ABOUT MS 13.

367
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,872
AND IN THE TAPE YOU WILL SEE

368
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:14,408
THAT AND I AM SURPRISED YOU

369
00:14:14,408 --> 00:14:15,676
ASKED THIS QUESTION.

370
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:18,379
AND MOST PEOPLE GOT IT RIGHT.

371
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,413
MS 13.

372
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:22,583
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT WHERE YOU

373
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,317
COME FROM.

374
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:26,053
THEY COME IN AND THEY ARE

375
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:26,820
ANIMALS.

376
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,357
AND SO WHEN MS 13 AND GANG

377
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:32,693
MEMBERS COME IN I REFER TO THEM

378
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,095
