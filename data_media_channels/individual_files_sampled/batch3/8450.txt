PHIL KEATING IN PANAMA CITY. A FEW FOLKS HEAD OUT, PUTTING THEIR TOES IN WHAT SHOULD BE SCOLD AND STORMY WATER. PHIL, THANK YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ON AGAIN/OFF AGAIN MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN MIGHT BE BACK ON AGAIN. IN A TWEET YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT SAID U.S. OFFICIALS ARE NOW ON THE GROUND IN NORTH KOREA TO PREPARE FOR THE SUMMIT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE TEAM IS IN THE DMZ BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA JUST LAST WEEK. PRESIDENT TRUMP PULLED OUT OF THE JUNE 12th MEETING BECAUSE OF OPEN HOSTILITY FROM THE NORTH. NOW HE SEEMS TO BE TAKING A MORE POSITIVE TONE. GREG PALKOT LIVE IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. SO NIGHT TIME THERE, GREG. WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE TALKS HAPPENING JUST NORTH OF THE DMZ? WELL, WHAT WE SEEM TO BE HEARING FROM A LOT OF OUR SOURCES ON THE GROUND HERE, LELAND, THESE TALKS ARE CRUCIAL TO WHETHER THIS PROPOSED SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN GOES FORWARD. THEY'RE HAPPENING ALONG THE DMZ ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE BORDER AND INTO NORTH KOREAN TERRITORY EXACTLY WHERE THIS SURPRISE SUMMIT TOOK PLACE OVER THE WEEKEND BETWEEN NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM AND PRESIDENT MOON.

WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM NORTH KOREA STATE MEDIA, THEY WILL DENUCLEARIZE ON THEIR OWN TIMETABLE DESPITE ANY EXTERNAL FACTORS. THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THE U.S. NEGOTIATORS DON'T WANT TO HEAR, LELAND. SO WE HAD THOSE TALKS ON THE DMZ. ANY IDEA ON PREMEETINGS HAPPENING PERHAPS IN SINGAPORE WHERE THE SUMMIT IS SET TO TAKE PLACE, GREG? YEAH, VERY QUICKLY HERE, LELAND, A COUPLE OF FRONTS IN SINGAPORE. THE POSSIBLE VENUE OF THIS SUMMIT, WE UNDERSTAND THE WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF JOE HAGAN IS ON THE GROUND WITH A TEAM. HE WILL BE MEETING NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS THERE. THEY'LL BE GOING OVER THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF A POSSIBLE SUMMIT. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND IF THINGS REALLY GO FORWARD THERE COULD BE ANOTHER MEETING WITH MIKE POMPEO AND A NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL FOR THE ALL GOES WELL. IT'S JUST OVER TWO WEEKS FROM NOW.
