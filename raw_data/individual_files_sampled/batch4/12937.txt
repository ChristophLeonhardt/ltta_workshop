a study from Brunel University London has found that physically weaker men are more likely than physically strong men to be attracted to socialism this is a real study which actually confirms the findings of a previous study from Denmark the Brunel academic studied 171 men aged 18 to 40 and found those who favored socialism tended to be what in scientific terminology are usually referred to as as weaklings or for wimps or milk toasts pantywaists or pansies or sissies or wusses or doormats or wimps maybe I said wimps already conversely men who supported capitalism tended to be physically stronger and to kick sand in the faces of men who supported socialism and then drive away in their far larger cars with their much prettier and more sexually satisfied wives once the stronger capitalist men were out of sight the socialist men tended to stick their tongues out at them and then go home sniffling with grimy tears stain faces and hide in the Attic pulling the wings off flies that's possible I made some of that up probably the part about the Flies anyway the scientists found and this is true that men who were more physically formidable were less likely to support the redistribution of wealth whether or not they were themselves wealthy this may be because weaker men sometimes referred to as Mama's boys or a girly man or cream puffs realize that the only way they can get their hands on the wealth of stronger men is by ganging up on them and plundering their honestly earned resources and then shearing them out among themselves while telling themselves what good and generous people they are for stealing other men's money stronger men on the other hand seem to believe that any pooling pantywaist mama's boy willing to expand the tyrannical powers of a constitutionally limited government in order to steal wealth that doesn't belong to him and which he would never have the strength the courage to steal or create on his own he probably deserves to have his underwear seized from the back and pulled so high up his nether bifurcation that he finds himself chewing on the smelly part then he should be hung by a shirt collar on the hook inside the locker of the prettiest girl in school so that when she finds him there she'll pretend to sympathize with him but then go on a date with the stronger capitalist man who will be able to support and sexually satisfy her according to one of the social scientists who perform the study dr. Heinrich von waste timer quote our researchers observed that those men who were technically designated as milksop source nibblers or whiny boys tended to more often say things like it's not fair and I want some too in wheedling high-pitched voices that just made you want to bounce them down the street like so many rubber balls unquote after the study was completed the researchers and the physically stronger capitalist men all went out for a beer together leaving the weaker socialist men behind clutching their plush dolls of Barack Obama or as they refer to him one of us trigger warning I'm

policy genius.com so you know talking about the weak and the strong and the fact that weak men can be very dangerous because weak people do kind of nasty things they win by subterfuge you know there's a wonderful yeah if you've never read the novel I know I quoted this before it's been a while since I quoted it but if you've never read the novel Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest now you may have seen the movie with Jack Nicholson and won a million Oscars but the book is better the book is much better really well-written book about a kind of a tough guy who is to get out of prison pretends he's insane and he's thrown into a mad asylum with all these people who are supposed to be insane and he starts to lead them and bring them back out of their insanity simply by the force essentially of his masculinity of his unbridled masculinity and there's one point in which you know McMurphy who's a roust ER and a drinker and a fighter and all these things he is talking to them about what it's like to be in a bar fight and he says to them you know a weak man is dangerous because he will kick you in the groin whereas a strong man will pick up his dangerous cuz he'll pick up a chair and he says a strong man seeks to make himself stronger while a weak man seeks to make you weaker and that is really what we are seeing in the political sphere today because the Democrats have the media they're weak they they don't have the government the Republicans have the government and the Democrats are wielding the media to create this complete atmosphere of fantasy and lies and to silence the right while the right so far is using the government and not maybe not as effectively as the left is using the press so like for instance right now everybody's waiting for Jeff Sessions to testify I can attest start testifying about 15 minutes we won't have time to talk about that today obviously we'll talk about it tomorrow but why why should we talk about it why is he testifying why is everybody talking about we already know that Trump isn't under investigation for anything or wasn't under investigation for this Russia collusion the idea that Jeff Sessions is some kind of Russian operative is so stupid and ridiculous and insane and the idea that he would collaborate or collude with Russians to do anything wrong with the election is just absolute nonsense this is all now a fantasy it's all you know shadows and mirrors and smoke that they are doing because they don't have the government and so they can't continue to do what they were doing before which is to take away our freedom you know what the most important thing about Jeff Sessions is I'm willing to bet that a lot of you listening to the sound of my voice don't know this story about Jeff Sessions at what he did recently was he stopped the Obama administration practice that encouraged and sometimes required banks and other companies to donate large amount of monies to outside groups as part of settlement agreements with the federal government now that sounds like an incredibly boring story but it's not listen for just a second say you're a bank say you're a big business okay and the federal government comes after you so one day it's like that show on Showtime billions one day the federal Attorney comes out and says you're not doing things right we're taking you in you could go to prison or or you could settle with the government for several hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and we want you to pay those hundreds of millions of dollars in fines to acorn to our left-wing you know whatever our left-wing charity is the charity of our choice that's what the Obama administration was doing and since we know that under you know the the new restrictions and the new regulations that Obama piled on business you're virtually always committing a crime when you're in business you're virtually always afoul of some stupid regulation or some law so it's just a question of time and of choice that the federal attorney is going to come to you from the deep state and say pay up and pay acorn or whoever we want you to pay as as a settlement for the and of course you don't want to go to jail you don't want to face even worse fines if you lose a court case and so you pay up Jeff Sessions stop that just a total slush fund you know the other thing is funny in conjunction with that while James Comey was testifying and everybody was going what's he saying what does it mean and did he say this and did he say that the house was passing a law that gutted dodd-frank by passing a bill that got a dodd-frank which is this incredible mountain of legislation and regulation that was written by Barney Frank and Christopher Dodd who the big causes to the men who actually caused the 2008 meltdown so they've caused the meltdown and then said oh wow you know the free market doesn't work we need more government intrusion in your business and if you violate that intrusion by the way you've got to pay millions of dollars to our favorite left-wing charity so all of this stuff was going on this incredible a chain of regulation and corruption deep state corruption that was funneling money to the left jeff sessions stomped on that as well he should of it should be illegal it shouldn't you shouldn't be able to do it in the first place but of course nobody ever stops it because if you win then you get the money so Jeff sessions cuz he's an honest guy straight arrow he he put a stop to it as well he should that's the big story about Jeff Sessions whatever happens today whatever however they wrong-foot him in testimony which i don't think they will I think he's smarter than most of them put most of the panel put together you know I just think it's not it's not even important it's not a story you know there was a there was a moment yesterday it was kind of symbolic of all this and it was it was funny I have to say it was Trump sat down and had his first meeting with his full cabinet because the left has been doing everything they can to you know slow down his appointments and he hasn't been the Trump administration hasn't been that efficient in appointing stocking the government with his people and getting the Obama people out so he sits down with his full cabinet and he goes around the table letting them introduce themselves to the press and they start to lavish praise on him and some of it got a little fulsome here just a brief clip of Reince Priebus lavishing praise on staff around you mr. president we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you've given us to serve your agenda and the American people and looking continuing to work very hard every day to accomplish those goals so it's a it's a blessing it's a you blessed us mr. Trump you blessed us mr. president so it got a little fulsome a little silly and Chuck Schumer got in a good shot we got to give the devil his due he he put out his own video making fun of it this is that I want to thank everybody for coming I just thought we'd go around the room Lucy have we do on the Sunday show yesterday your tone was perfect you were right on message Michelle had my hair look coming out of the gym this morning you have great hair nobody has better yeah we going further I just want to say thank you for the opportunity and blessing to serve your agenda well good on you Chuck you got in a good shot I mean that that is funny the thing is though though that really the meeting when I actually watched the video because everybody was making so much fun of it and I didn't find it that offensive I didn't find it that's silly you know but listen turnabout is fair play but it is kind of symbolic of what's going on as the Trump is putting together a government he has the government the Republicans have the government and all that the left has is that kind of thing is mockery and confusion and fantasy this fantasy that they're creating and lies and it Trump's real point in that meeting was very different than what Trump oh how Trump opened that meeting was really what he was trying to say and this is a cut number too much great news to share with the American people today as we continue to deliver on our promises do to a record long delay in confirmation and the confirmation process by the Senate Democrats which I call the obstructionist maybe they'll change but I doubt it they're truly obstructionists this is our first cabinet meeting with the entire cabinet president the confirmation process has been record-setting along I mean record-setting long with some of the finest people in our country being delayed and delayed and delayed but that's much of that is over and now we go with our through as you know the regular process with people in other levels of government and that's a very long process also including ethics committee which is become very difficult to deal with so the Trump's real point was basically it took them this long to put this cabinet together not because of his incompetence but because this is what the Democrats are doing and we all remember we all remember what you know Hillary Clinton said when Trump hinted that he might not accept the results of the rule of the election and she said that's horrifying I can't quite do her screechie Hawks cry of a voice but she said terrifying because you know the democratic process and if you could just think back to this stuff on MSNBC I don't you know I try not to hit MSNBC too much because I believe they're an openly honest left-wing station it's not like NBC and CBS and ABC in the New York Times and The Washington Post who pretend to be honest brokers of the news but are in fact are far left far-left operatives basically with press cards MSNBC at least is telling you like Fox News we are left wingers we are right-wingers that's that's fine by me but MSNBC you I just remember when she when he said that when Trump said that he might not accept the results of the election he was gonna leave people in suspense they went on forever this is disqualifying it's the end even even the head of the RNC at the time Michael Steele said oh it's just qualifying he can't be a candidate if he says this and all this stuff but of course now it's the Democrats who will not accept this will this election and are just planning to win the house so they can impeach Trump that is all they're trying to do is lay the groundwork for that with this complete and utter fantasy of Russian collusion I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but but you can come over daily wire comm and watch the show right there if you subscribe and if you subscribe you can be in the mailbag more importantly because your horrible miserable life that you're just dragging yourself through could be completely transformed by having your questions answered on this show so come on over
