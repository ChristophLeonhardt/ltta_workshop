building bridges between China and France and backing the new Silk Road between continents the French president is on a three-day visit with trade topping his Chinese agenda what do the potential deals mean for both Asia and the world this is inside story hello there and welcome to the program I'm Laura Kyle it's being described as a new stage in French diplomacy as well as potential trade deals being signed president Emmanuel macron is on his first official visit to China economic issues are the focus of the three-day trip as well as North Korean nuclear missiles climate change and investments in Africa look at those issues in just a moment machan has been speaking in the ancient city of Xian you know of young it's up to Europe and Asia to France and China to define and come up with the rules of a game where we could all win or lose I have come here to tell China that I am determined to move the euro China partnership into the 21st century so that it fits in this new framework that we need to define together Europe will embrace this new strategy because it is now aware of its role in its place in this century it will get involved on all of the main topics yes my friends what I have also come here to say is that Europe is back some of the issues on macrons agenda are climate change with President Donald Trump announced in the US as pulling out of the Paris climate Accord it's a key topic for cooperation between both countries also what's described as the New Silk Road macron is backing president Xi's trillion dollar project the one belt one Road initiative aims to extend China's reach across Asia and Beyond by using a network of new railways ports and other infrastructure and macro wants to strengthen the French partnership with China particularly in Africa Makhan says France has the experience of unilateral imperialism in Africa and wants to help China avoid what he calls France's African mistakes finally China and France are both nuclear powers and veto-wielding permanent members of the UN Security Council so they have much to talk on North Korea as well as the war in Syria and the israeli-palestinian conflict so plenty to talk about as well with our panel and let's bring them in in Beijing inot angin an advisor on economic affairs to the Chinese government in Singapore Graham on web research fellow at Nanyang Technological University and in lille france but only kamal director of research at the French Institute for International and strategic affairs welcome all of you I know an awful lot is on the agenda here to get through in in three days but what's the key thing that China is wanting from France well it's this to a very vocal proponent of the Belton Road initiative this is really something that Xi Jingping has been looking for with Germany right now intra and not transition but trying to figure out its government having macron step up as a proponent of globalization wedded to the climate change agenda this is exactly what they've been looking for okay so but telling me that Khan has given this support for the one belt one Road initiative what is it that France now wants in return what is interesting is that Macomb address this issue as early as his first speech under you arrived in Spain and we have to keep in mind that the choice of Ferretti and is very significantly symbolic for the Chinese and this is where the silk road's in its historical purpose of course used to start so it is a very important location to address the importance of the New Silk Road and the wish or will of France to join and to do something about it I mean we've been expecting a lot from mark on this issue since he was elected and this is clearly the first time it does address is desire to cooperate more with China on this issue and try to define together what is exactly the objectives but also the intentions of China in when it comes to the Silk Road okay and what was the key thing key takeaway that it wants to that Macomb wants to take back to Paris from this Chinese visit well not address also very important issue for France at the moment which is a research of a multilateral like objection of a world affair France has been since Mekons election very willing to as separate a little bit from what we call the Atlantis posture posture very linked to the United States notably under the Obama ministration and of course the election of Donald Trump in the u.s. so they changed this paradigm as well as the brexit in United Kingdom and McConnell has repeatedly mentioned his intention to adopt a more we call it in France the more the girliest me Tyrion bitter Indian posture that refers of course to the late president's transfer board and foster media and this posture is based on more independent research of implications of great powers not constantly linked that to our Atlantic allies and McCall addressed again this particular message during his fiction see and which is very interesting so he called China for a bigger involvement in world affairs but also a bigger partnership on world issues such as terrorism such as Syria such as North Korea such as of course also global warming Graham we've got two leaders here with very big ambitions with the u.s. in retreats as Bartolome just mentioned is global dominance on their minds clearly I mean a global dominance is is a theme that it's a constant continually discussed in light of the shake-up that we've seen in global politics over the last 12 months in the least and whoever is going to step up to the fore is you know want to come up with a an arrangement that will benefit not just themselves by the international community taking taking into account how highly integrated our global economy already is and I think this is part of the of the messaging that I will see unfold in the discussions over the next few days that China is being reminded not to just look at itself but to look at the rest of the world and how what it does has huge impact across the Asia Pacific region and the rest of the world and I think this is a very welcomed moment in in terms of this of this meeting in having China being invited if you like to step forward and play a constructive role as possible that can benefit everyone and one area where we can particularly see this is Africa I know we've got France warning China not to make the same mistakes it did on that continent during colonial times is this a message that China hears and will respond to well yeah I don't know how they'll officially respond to it but the having a willing partner on both sides is very very important China obviously has the money they have a vision for the Belgian road initiative and France is very connected to its former colonial empire and it wants to maintain those ties but it doesn't necessarily have the wherewithal to put in the kind of infrastructure and investment that is needed so forming a partnership seems very very logical it's a win-win situation it's not the zero-sum game that you have in Trump's view of the world and but in terms of what France in what China sees France is one is they want a willing partner in Africa which we just just discussed they're also looking for a some bolstering it's not only that macron is talking about doing more with China he wants the EU to play a more central role and with China recognizing his let us say gravitas at this stage it will help him as he goes back to you and says listen we either adopt the view the protectionist view of the United States and we retreat and give up the values that we've had through globalization or we go forward and we Ford something much more clear with China so I would disagree that this is somehow taking China to task or inviting them this is a multipolar world and I think China recognizes that and that's why there's going to be quite a bit of give and take okay just to the Chinese seem a Khan as the new leader of Europe with of course brexit taking the UK out of the picture a little bit and Merkel focused on domestic affairs well I don't necessarily know that they they see him as the sole leader they see it for what it is he cannot do anything without Germany so therefore there's going to have to be consensus but he's the first mover as Merkel as you said is come you know confined to figuring out how her government is going to look if she can put it together he's the one who stepped forward and I think that will be to his advantage and we'll see that in the number of deals that he's able to bring to the table and take back to France okay but telling me it's not all roses in light isn't it because we've also heard macron calling for a stronger Europe to quote face China and the u.s. so it should be Jing feel a little bit threatened I don't think it will be frightened about that but I totally agree with what has been say that previously regarding the importance of the EU in backhoes visit to China and I think that my common knowledge is that but also seeking thing and knowledge is that and for the Chinese leaders at the moment Macomb is perceived as what we may call the head of European diplomacy and if we may put word to it Macomb is in a position that no European leader has at the moment Angela Merkel is facing some domestic political problems and she doesn't have the same attributes of power that you have mentioned earlier I see that the UN Security Council nuclear power and the capacity to send forces abroad but these are attributes that France has do UK also does but as we know the UK is a little bit out at the moment so in the eyes of the Chinese France is playing a more significant role not only in world affairs but especially in shaping some sort of European defence and foreign policy and back home is incarnated it so therefore this visit is not just about French Chinese relations is far more important and ambitious than that it's about the new approach we have mentioned that it's also about China EU relations and its future so that that's why this visit is I think far more since then on get usnea curl last trip to baking princess okay um if we are seeing a partnership forged between Sheehan and Mackin Graham how different are they in their views when it comes to global governance I mean how are these men going to get on and and work together well coming back to my point about about the invitation this is exactly it I think a macron is clearly aware that at this moment in global affairs the last thing you want to do is to it's a push China away at a time when a lot of middle and major powers are on the retreat or the perception that is an ongoing retreat and to have China come into this conversation and to play its part and presumably also perhaps be more open to China's ways of doing of of global conduct as well I think this is going to be a two-way conversation and I think the illusion is quite clear even in terms of macrons reference to the Silk Road being a two-way street essentially not just in physical terms but in conversational terms as well for for for China to be more open to to the ways of established global governance and regulatory undertakings and vice-versa for for for the EU and and and other economic bloc's to be open to China's own way of doing things doing things as well I think this is the kind of partnership we're going to see going forward and not just in terms of just China and and France and I think Bartholomew's point I think this is a much larger conversation about Asia and Europe as well as both blocks work more closely together in sort of a win-win arrangement because each one has the has something the other lacks the the EU has has you know has a pile of experience and resources and and of course there are markets abound in Asia to be a to be tapped into on the asian side of the house so i think this is going to be you know a win-win situation as I mentioned okay just to follow on that that similar vein of thoughts I know most Western leaders when they go to China are pressured to hold China to account for its human rights records will we see macron doing that with China or is that going to be pushed to the sides in favor of this new partnership well actually we'll never know because his office has already announced that any kind of talk about human rights will be in private and so there will be no report on it in terms of how macron is is looking at this I mean he's in a difficult position you know this the book fire and fury coming out as this meeting comes about the world is facing very very strong questions about what exactly the US direction is and what is Trump's role in it so you find yourself with very very few partners the EU needs markets China is a massive market he's trying to figure out how to do it look for him to be pressing on issues like opening up finance services for Chinese for French banks in China they already have the first one a license was granted to a French bank to start operating in China I think you'll see this being pushed this has been carefully orchestrated and been in the works for a long time but this latest revolution from this book even if only 50 percent were true it's quite disturbing and will obviously give pause to both sides as they try to figure out what shaped the world they want should be hmm okay I mean at one key issue facing the entire world is global warming we know that macro has positioned himself to be the leader to take forward the Paris Accords especially after Donald Trump announcing that the US will pull out of that bar telling me how keen is he to get China's renewed commitments or those agreements well the problem with China when it comes to facing global warming is the gap between the intentions and the reality and we expect some significant moves from China and of course any more will be work on considering the importance of China on such issues so Mac Hong is bringing a message which is quite clear we need you we need China on this particular topic and we are therefore somehow following what are your intentions and we are looking at how you transform it into some sort of reality so that's that's a very important issue but on top of that I would like to come back to what matters a little bit when it comes to the perceptions between the two countries and more broadly the Europeans on one side and the Chinese on the other there are some fears in Europe nowadays regarding China's intentions China's power and of course the nature of Chinese regime and therefore McConnell must address such issues it cannot of course talk clearly about human rights because we know that you will face a lot of critics and we know that unfortunately you will be extremely concentrated but it already did that in his speech in Seon he mentioned the fact that the the New Silk Road initiative so incensed is subject to a lot of attention but also a lot of questions in the world and especially in Europe and therefore China is invited to clarify its intentions and I think is it extremely important clarification of China on global warming on the New Silk Road but also more generally on its involvement in world affairs this is really what naka expects from these exchanges with the Chinese leaders over the next few days grandma can see you nodding your head that you agree then that China does need to be more transparent yes very much so and it takes a highly respected major power like France to tell China that and for China to listen deliberate on their on that point and to make a response and I think we this is a very welcome in the Asia Pacific because it's not just France or the rest of the EU or the rest of the world really that's concerned about about the future of China but very much much much so here in our backyard in the Asia Pacific in Southeast Asia we have very similar questions there's a lot of hope about what China can do in terms of raising lifting all boats in the region if you like but there's also a lot of questions about strategic intentions especially with the protracted issue of the South China Sea dispute which is still still ongoing even though it's a slow burn issue and with with France in the picture it's actually a very welcome respite because France is lifting that conversation up and you know holding China to account if you like in a sense saying that there are certain rules of the game that one ought to abide by and you'd be more respected for it and this this is a part of an ongoing approach which i think is extremely constructive about socializing and engaging China at a time when we have you know the current US administration of the previous US administration containing China which is extremely unhelpful yeah I mean we haven't heard from President Xi as of Monday evening when we're recording this program during this visit from macron but INA do you think we're going to see him giving some indications that China will be open and transparent and show its intentions that it's it's going to react well to any French pressure on this matter well quite frankly the days when colonial powers can lecture China I think are over and I would respectfully disagree with my colleagues on that particular issue China is the one who is spending the most on environmental protection they're the ones we've said to their provincial and city leaders your environmental record we'll follow you for the rest of your life they've criminalized it I don't know how much more you could do to show that you're very serious about tackling pollution it was one of the three and this its intentions in Africa what about those issues those are very important issues and yet to be decided how the partnership could work in Africa it's going to center around this this issue of fighting terrorism in terms of the Silk Road China cannot do this alone though the one trillion dollar number is far short of what is needed China has taken a very bold step said we will be the first but they need other countries and to that extent yes they're looking for partners they're not looking to dictate they're trying to set an example of the New World Order which is not about one country dominating other countries but simply working together for the collective good in other words globalization 2.0 okay so bar telling me how far then can this relationship go if China is not willing to play by any rules that macron might want to impose I think it's in China's interest to play the the world that I haven't seen in CG beans phosphorus in Syria he became the leader of China any sign of protectionism or will to be more I seeking some sort of isolation china is more and more engaged in a lot of issues and I do it really with China's air force on the global warming issues I mean China is indeed doing a lot of a force but we also know that China must do a lot of before so that's why we are of course paying a lot of attention to the results but anyway yes China I believe is carefully listening to the advices but also to the possibilities for partnerships with partners like France and I I believe that for the Chinese that is it is extremely important he wish apes somehow the relation between the EU and China that unfortunately has been a little bit shaping in the past they said two decades so this is something very important to be real especially considering the international context that we have all of us described in details and in in this purpose I believe that Macklin's visits and the timing of these visits is considered in China has some sort of opportunity to show what they call a new face for the international community a face of the country more willing to cooperate dissipated age itself also okay okay I'm just largely Mac Mac Wall has pledged to visit China every of his presidency I mean that's a pretty big deal isn't it that this is a relationship that we're going to want to keep an eye on certainly and I think macron has clearly understands the importance of saying that and following through with that going forward the issue of face is a very important principle or concept in Asian culture and you know the more face-to-face meetings the better and on a regular basis at that and I think China is going to be it's very welcoming of that of that overture and it's only going to cement relations between these two powers going forward and it's going to really consolidate a new bridge at a time when there's just so much fluidity going on in terms of the power politics of the global system okay well keep an eye on it we certainly will many thanks to all our guests for joining us here today ina Tang in there in Beijing graham on web in Singapore and
