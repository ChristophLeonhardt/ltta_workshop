sad that phrase borrowed from a great man is perhaps the most fitting way to describe a rough week Sulekha stalks so Rachel and joshie asthma will join the panel of deplorable z to discuss it as well as why TV is dead Netflix is killing you and book have the worst words the worst words folks don't they plus the mailbag I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show generally speaking this was a rush week for the president it was a rough week for America now I am always hopeful I always try to look for the bright side of things and there is a small glimmer in this week there's a bright side to it which is that kim jonghwan back down so we're not all going to get blown up by North Korean nuclear weapons they have backed down on their threat to send a missile to Guam and president Trump was getting a lot of flack for his tough talk about North Korea he said that he would send fire and fury on them like the world has never seen I think was the quote he said that he US military was locked and loaded a North Korea and of course people mocked him there was a ruby was war mongering he was shooting from the hip but it seems to have worked North Korea's back then obviously there were a lot of back channels that were going on between State Department and North Korea and also with China but all in all seems like a great deal folks seems like we got the art of the deal here North Korea has released some Western prisoners all-in-all a nice bit of news for the week all the rest of the news this week was absolutely durable so for the bad news President Trump has been attacked on all sides on the left and the right for his various responses to the charlottesville attacks and the neo-nazis fighting antiva here is the first statement that he made but we're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville Virginia we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sites on many sites now the statement actually isn't untrue there were many sides of culpability here and pifo was beating people up as they always do with these events but it was tone-deaf and it also misses the enormity of the difference here antifa did their usual pepper spray beating people up hitting people with gloves but the neo-nazis did kill a woman and injured 19 others so it was just a little bit tone-deaf everybody basically agreed he could have come out and named the neo-nazis even named an Tifa but he didn't do that so then he issue a second statement to correct that as I said on Saturday we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence it has no place in America we must love each other show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred bigotry and violence racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the KKK neo-nazis white supremacist and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as American he comes out he names these guys he names the guys who threw the rally there aren't a lot of these people by the way their numbers do not seem to be growing despite what you're seeing in the media but he goes out he names and we don't need them nobody likes the Nazis no mainstream conservatives showed up to this event no alt light showed up to this event not even the people who play around and play footsie with the old right showed up to this thing so good he names them he'd already acknowledged that there was trouble on the left in the previous statement seems like he's done but for some reason he had to go out and address this issue again and in typical trumpian fashion it was a mixed bag there was the the third statement the press conference did start out very well when he was attacking there was a lying Democrat acts in the media I think they do you know far as I'm concerned that was a horrible horrible day wait a minute I'm not finished I'm not finished fake news day horrible I'm not finished fake news so beautiful calls them out in a way the politicians have not done it's just glorious but he didn't finish there he had to undo all the good he did in that second statement do we have it I think this blame on both sides you must remember both sides I think there's blame on both sides so okay he has to go back he says he's blame on both sides as a result of this third statement now CEOs begin abandoning the president advisory councils there were two advisory councils in particular the manufacturing council and the strategy and Policy Forum it just got worse and worse the CEO of Apple Tim Cook issued a statement said that what Trump said about the attacks in charlottesville runs counter to American ideals Kenneth Fraser the CEO of Merck criticized President Trump and of course with President Trump he fights back so he immediately takes to criticizing the CEO of Merck that doesn't go very well CEOs from a ton of different companies who were advising Trump begin to drop off the leaders of Pepsi IBM Blackstone BCG NFL Under Armour everybody begins to jump ship so president Trump preempts them and he disbands himself those two advisory councils and we do have to nuance this a little bit the New York Times which Andrew flavin rightly acknowledges as a former newspaper the failing New York Times had a headline today said CEOs long avoided politics Trump is changing the calculus how long did CEOs been avoiding politics I even noticed that I've noticed massive pride month campaigns at different companies I've noticed mandatory diversity seminars mandatory harassment seminars mandatory re-education seminars I see them wading into politics all the time they've been virtue signaling for for a very long time but during the Obama administration it was ratcheted up to a new level so typical fake news from the New York Times nevertheless they've really waited into politics here and appear to be jumping ship from the White House now to make matters worse White House chief strategist Steve Bannon decided to call a left-leaning outlet the American Prospect and give his thoughts on what is going on and it's a little unclear whether he got scaramouche heed whether Steve Bannon got mooched here or and didn't know that it was an interview or if he was doing this intentionally to leak some information for the president it seems to be the former it seems like this did not go as planned but who knows you never really know with president Trump's administration so on the positive side Bannon called white nationalists quote a fringe al woman full of losers and a collection of clowns absolutely true he said he thinks the media plays it up too much and we got to help crush it also absolutely true there are not that many of these guys and the media love them they love tying them to the rest of the write possibly bad for the administration he trash-talked his colleagues in the same way scaramouche II did a little less colorful language and he undermined president Trump's North Korea strategy he admits on this phone call that North Korea has us by the quill uni that if we launch an attack on North Korea they're going to kill a lot of people in Seoul they're going to attack Seoul with conventional weapons you could have a hundred thousand people die or more so the worst part of all of this for the administration is that we're talking about all of this nonsense and no policy is getting done we're not getting tax reform we were supposed to get that in the summer we're not getting Obamacare repeal which was tried and tried again and stopped by members of the Senate and the liberal Republicans in the Senate instead we're talking about Confederate monuments as if that matters at all as if this is the the national crisis that we need to pull down these statues that have been up for 100 years and we're talking about the court politics the court intrigue who's getting fired who's next out who's coming up and it's all just a waste of time and now to round out the week there has been a terrorist attack in Barcelona we don't have a ton of information about it yet I assume we'll find out that it will confirm that it was radical Episcopalians that committed it but until then we don't know really sad a sad way to start the week a really sad way to end the week and all around it's been pretty pretty rough so now we've got we will have to talk a little bit about Barcelona I guess there isn't a lot of information yet this is the first time that there has been a terrorist attack in a place where I have smoked a cigar this is in Las Ramblas a major tourist center of Spain and so clearly it does put certain things into perspective while we're talking about the court intrigue here while we're talking about Confederate monuments we do have to wonder what is the bigger picture what are we fighting as a country what are the biggest threats to our freedom and to our husbands to end to ourselves and our families so speaking of the bigger picture let's widen this picture and bring on our panel of deplorable z we have Zil Rachel Flicka stalks and Josh Yasmine so everybody is always saying Trump is having a terrible go of it is this week as bad for the administration as it seems or is it fake news but no he's probably having a rough week which was just going so I guess money doesn't solve everything now good I noticed that these people out there anyone on the free education so they can make all this money right all this money want to make a whole bunch of money for stuff that they just want for free what do you need all that money for it just goes to show they hate people when you guys are all success when you make all that money that's wrong there's gonna be people that are going to hate you too these college professors are going to be chaining another generation to hate you that's a strong point you know money can't buy happiness happiness also can't buy money we'll have to we'll have to consider that Fleck us how does Trump bounce back from this um I think it's going to be what he always does you just got to keep bringing it work right past the media's narrative I mentioned last time I was in the show that I watched miss backwards so never Trump times as bad if you can the Chia I think you maybe have the better people think I think he did a great job it's bowing egg groups on both sides what more he could have done look if she had I think he's got to be fit and just keep Island proof it's a war that is right the consistency is a real issue because he gave his first statement which was okay he gave the second statement naming the people probably a little bit better and I think give us a third statement a backtracked on the second and creates a lot of confusion maybe it was for DHS Josh China seems to be cooperating with us on trade in North Korea would you say that there is a glimmer of hope this week on the foreign policy front um I think so I think that Trump has done a good job behind the scenes but he hasn't done a good job articulating his vision he hasn't done a good job telling us what he's done behind the scenes we've had to rely on administration officials op-eds and uh you know reporting raja jesting the president Trump does not have the best words I'm telling her that's where the folks because I won't stand for that he has a communication problem for sure even when he does something good he makes it seem like it's a bad thing or he doesn't articulate it properly that's the problem and perception is oftentimes reality well you know all right we've got to get into the news I want to keep this panel around for at least one news story and then we'll have to say goodbye to all of you who haven't subscribed to the daily wire in the news today Apple is spending 1 billion dollars a billion with a be developing original content Netflix is going to spend seven billion dollars developing original content and Facebook is even developing original TV content though is TV did uh well it's like just like saying rock-and-rollers did it's like no rocket roadside ad T DS not dead uh but yeah I would agree that uh Deaf culture is being promoted as I when it's talk about this stuff is bad for say yeah a lot of the stuff is bad words they promote crappy messages hey if they're gonna spend all his money and it's funny man because I always say the Republicans are the ones with all the money but it looks like there was it wasn't all money to be able to invest in all this sub units attributive just with somebody else's money may be great if he's so-called rich Republicans I'd like to find out who they are be great if they would put their money whatever mouth is and start investing in some content to compete with a full yeah this is a plea from Hollywood if you're out there Republicans with money give us some TV show or movie is there some something yes I hear Republicans well with the money rich Republicans like where I'm looking for I can't find them anywhere I still I still haven't even gotten all my book checks yet Josh is this new all on-demand model is it good or is it bad for the consumer you can stay up late you can watch whatever show you on you watch it for a hundred hours is that good or bad for us it's a little bit of both I think that's a strong statement well you're going to have to defend that ultimately it gives consumers more choice you know I can go to work during the day and then come back home at night and watch a show at midnight if I wanted to but I think there's something to be said about the fact that TV in decades prior gave the country a way to coalesce around something it was this moment of stillness of this collective unity where we can all kind of put aside our politics put aside our differences and engage in the show and now TV watching seems to be a solitary act it seems to be you know individuals alone in the rooms watching on their laptops rather than projecting here no I think you make a very good point because there are two levels of is they used to be on the one hand you've got families coming together around a TV and watching it but they're also with the fact that all of America was watching the same show right there weren't that many channels we had a common culture flek us does this destruction of the common culture explain some of the crazy polarization we're seeing yeah I would say so I mean they're really catering to the younger viewers who are very computer savvy very tech savvy they want to watch these shows in their own time I think a lot of these people are watching to see shows not a fairly they used to back in the day where you should tune in every day at 10 o'clock and your program this so I think it heads down the tricky road because all these companies are festive more to these liberal outlets are now going to be pushed to narrative on don't the other fronts and it G really hard to competitive that's absolutely true the one exception might be the game of Thrones Game of Thrones is a kind of common thing it's always trending on Twitter there were rumors that it leaked did you all watch the leaked episode well considered a game of girls and weaking and how much nudity that just stopped gross well that's an image that I won't be able to spoon out of my mind's eye unfortunately I am so glad we don't have any criminals on our panel of deplorable z but they're deplorable in many other ways but now if you don't subscribe to The Daily wire you can't keep watching them we want to thank all the subscribers who have come along with it you can go over now to daily wire I kind of watch the rest of the show and if you haven't done that already go to daily wire comm and sign up it's only ten bucks a month 100 dollars a year you get the leftist here's tumblr which keeps your leftist ears hot or cold always salty and savory and delicious and you'll also get my show you'll get at the end replacement show and you'll get the bench up euro show so go over there right now daily wire comm we'll be right back so I have bad news about the binge watching TV culture according to a study there's so many studies a new study shows that binge watching is one series before bed is worse for your health than watching the same amount of regular TV because of something called quote mental arousal how do they know what I'm watching Fleck us one of the negative effects of these streaming platforms is it's so hard to find time to read books 23% of Americans per year don't read a single book and that rate has tripled since 1978 are we getting dumber or is this TV all these great TV shows are they somewhat edifying hmm hard to say I mean I watch a lot of Netflix I'm in great shape so you'd make an excellent argument I think that said on it I think that's it right I mean I'm in pretty good shape let me be the poster poster boy of it that place doesn't necessarily make you not exercise and do stuff if you sit there and watch the entire season show on a Sunday you know last week and I think it's going to affect that healthy like luck is healthy likes luck is oh science is always scaring us with nonsense like climate change and tobacco warning labels do you believe this mental arousal thing that it keeps you from sleeping is Netflix really killing us then it is me next concerns well I don't think it in terms of rails at all a sense of be also be flash and thought but you know I wanted to say something to a point that my man was talking about in terms of like you know uh you know this solitary watching you know if it's ironic there was they talked about unity and bringing everybody together but this ended their promoting about this binge-watching was it it's like there's no unity and watching TV anymore and people don't want to say nothing because they get into a conversation like no don't spoil it for me so right I'd just be like yeah and not only that this this if I separates the herd because now it's like you just you don't have to uh you know there's a push back the culture is isolated by themselves and watching the stuff these ideals that they're promote their pumping into their brain and why there's no uh no failure in numbers anymore right yeah no filter no signet they got to buy their sympathy just pump their ideas into their hips like one of the top I think it's worth man yeah we used to watch a TV show and then that's all anybody would talk about the next day and now you explicitly can you can talk about anything but that because people are watching and on different time tables that is true Josh you are a degenerate when was the last time you turned off the TV and read a book several weeks ago actually that is better than most Americans it is well I was an English major so um but you know though is right I think that there's something unhealthy about this solitary TV watching and I don't want to say that you know people aren't consuming text people aren't engaging with language because I think the mediums are changing I think people are reading more articles online I think people are consuming text on their phones I think so reading the daily wired Act reading the daily water Tom exactly I never stopped they never get it off their phones exactly so I think the the way we consume text is changing and that's going to keep changing but so we're on the verge of an almost kind of like a revolution where our own sort of printing press and the printing press is digital media yuck I like the old media but speaking of that you probably right speaking of those books and these new media a new study uh not yet another study has found to quote a dramatic increase in swear words in American literature over the last 60 years books published between 2005 and 2008 were 28 more times more likely to contain swear words than books published in the 1950s and one study in particular found that there was one word that was 678 times more likely to be included I'll let you think about what that word that was so WTF man why all the naughty language and you know and I feel like I'm kind of on the spot here because my book actually called weapon of mass destruction and when people look for it it's like man I tried to look up your book I just keep running into gay porn that was part of the strategy man it's like to help get the liberals to get it on their radar too somehow but despite that I think that it's the only profanity that is in my book and even a SS an academic stands for American socialist state so but yeah for some reason people want to use profanity to give punctuation to their point you know it's like you know might just drop this curse word it's gonna make my point so much more valid and I think about you know what went God you know spoke the universe with this is big deep F you'd have to say that man even let there be light children superkicked expected that's power yeah you don't need a curse to be powerful yeah you don't you don't see God using a lot of naughty language in there there's really strong statements in Genesis I don't know what text you're reading I marked Marshall as a particular Bible Josh is this a reflection of our more shallow culture a reflection of our thought you know David McCullough's said that too right well is to think clearly that's why it's so hard is that is that what it's a reflection of I don't know if it's a reflection of our more shallow culture I think that publishers are trying to attract consumers and they're willing to do anything to attract consumers even if that includes profanity eroticism there's a reason Fifty Shades of Grey was so successful it wasn't because it was a brilliant plot it was because you know it was catering to a specific kind of consumer and the character development exactly absolutely brilliant every challenge is absolutely no you know that's absolutely true and you're right though when you when you use swear words too much they get a little watered down you know they it's sort of like how conservationists say we have to kill animals so that we can preserve animals there is an argument that we have to stop using swear words so that we can keep using swear words effectively Fleck us do we need to clean up our language I don't think so I think this is a sign that freedom of speech is alive and well in the US I think this is a great thing and there's no sup and around with the First Amendment and no one stopping in it and free speech is alive and well that's what it tells me the first effing amendment absolutely okay well on that note I gotta say goodbye to you guys our panel of deplorable zou Rachael flex talks and Josh Jasna I will also note by the way that my own book reasons to vote for Democrats a comprehensive guide does not include a single swear word so if you're looking for family-friendly reading I think we're a place to go look okay it's time for the mailbag we have a lot of great mailbag question so I'm going to run through them as fast as I can first one from Brett dear bestselling author mr. Knowles what advice do you have for authors looking to write their first book really enjoy the podcast and the panel of deplorable thanks Brett I have no advice for authors looking to write their first book because I've never written a book though I am a number one international best-selling author with a presidential endorsement author not a writer it's very confusing I would ask Andrew Clavin or her shapiro on for any advice on writing book since they have written them before from Jeff hey Michael I have really enjoyed your show and the people you have brought on I was wondering who you have read or listened to about your faith to help you continue down the Catholic path on Catholic and I really enjoy reading and watching YouTube of Bishop Baron Peter Crieff and Scott Hahn thanks those guys are all great I can recommend some people in particular my own priest in New York who is he'll be officiating my wedding next year his father George rut ler rut ler is an amazing guy I've read a lot of his books and all of his columns in crisis magazine he writes a weekly column and you can get his homilies online at the Church of st. Michael in NYC it's in Hell's Kitchen I rarely does a Sunday go by that I don't read them or listen to them they are really really good he is in a really interesting man you should look up some biographies of him I think he was Bill Buckley's priest he's got a long association with the conservative movement and people on the right and he was a hero of 9/11 he's just a really really amazing man and I think his writing more than more than basically anybody's has brought me back to the Catholic faith and two ecumenical Christianity writ large so I highly recommend reading him and then of course CS Lewis and GK Chesterton are also great and and unfortunately only one of those guys has YouTube videos so you can explore them at your leisure from thou question hey Michael I was wondering if you could give your opinion on Gen Z and what the post millennial generation might mean for the conservative movement Thanks I love them they are the best people ever they are we had the greatest generation in the 30s and 40s but they're pretty close maybe they'll be better I don't know they have a lot of time and we might be going to war with Korea or something they're great I think my generation the Millennials grew up and were enamored of Barack Obama I got to college right when Obama won in 2008 and we just totally fell for this guy we were a little soft we were helicopter parented participation trophies all of that from what I know of Gen Z and the post Millennials they are reacting to that they I think they see the world a little bit more clearly they cut through some of the BS and some of the ideological constructs that we were imbued with when we were kids and I think they're just great and they should keep on doing it from Tyler question knowles of the tro i'm sorry from tyler here's the question yo Mike will you please answer this phenomenal question and that's the entire a mailbag question and the answer is yes from Joe question Knowles of the trolls you hear a lot of people talk a lot of talk about how Republicans and specifically Trump are the largest threat to our republic these comments typically made by people who would rather wipe their tookus with the Constitution however on an international front there were threats in the rogue regimes of North Korea and Iran ultimately the domestic threat of seeing the Browns versus the rezidentura streets strikes me as most jarring what do you think is the largest threat to our great nation I will read you a poem to answer them some say the world will wind up Nazi some say liberal fascist from what I'm told by paparazzi I hold with those who forecast Nazi but if it must return to ashes I think I've read enough of Marx to know Antipa clashes always throw off sparks also trashes I hope that answers your question from Patrick question do you think the Republican Party will move toward libertarianism not populism or the or rather to the left in order to survive a lot of people ask that how are we going to survive how are we going to survive in this culture because the culture is so against us we get it from Hollywood we get it from the mainstream press all the time we see in our Facebook feed with hysterical lefties but we are winning if you look at the actual numbers we are winning so much we're almost sick and tired of winning we took almost a thousand seats under Barack Obama's presidency in the state houses we took 24 out of 32 governorships in those places with Republican state houses where Republican legislators rather we took the Congress obviously we took the Senate we took the presidency I think we're doing pretty well between libertarianism or conservatism or on those fringes some people advocate white identity politics I think what we have to do is always refer back to human dignity and ordered liberty if we refer back to those foundational principles I think we can read the American founding documents and the American ideals through them and we won't go wrong we've always got to stay focused on ordered liberty and human dignity if we do that I think we're going to just keep on winning from coal dear mr. Rodham Clinton Knowles I'm glad that you could reference my cousin I noticed when you advertise the subscription for The Daily wire you don't show off the leftist tears mug is this because Ben found out that you were related to HRC and won't let you use one love to show my condolences to you for being related to Hillary that is not the reason it's actually because steven crowder smashed my leftist here's tumblr on his own show so said another question from Kyle master Knowles a couple of times on the show now I've heard rubbing millennial mentioned that she is hoping to have a family within five years I think I see where this is going while I am unsure of the status of her love life I believe I could help her reach that goal I am a straight white cisgender conservative male so long as she can see past all the privilege and unconscious bias I innately possessed I think we could really make it work thanks Kyle Kyle I have said this before and I will say it again we are auditioning rummy millennial to become a sister-wife once I get married to sweet little Elise in my fiance and we start our apocalyptic right-wing polygamous cult she's mine hands off from James hi Michael do you believe the alt rights philosophy is similar to the left in that it is somewhat of a pseudo religion as I believe it was set on yours or Clavin show the left prefers the essence of something rather than the content of that thing I think what you mean is they prefer the appearance or the semblance of something rather than what actually makes it that thing what animates it I find it quite sad to quote a great man thanks James yeah I think they're two sides of the same coin I think they and I think they would admit that too they say these identity tactics have been working for the left for a long time and we're going to start doing it to this disreputable dishonorable behavior is been working for the left we're going to do it too so yeah absolutely it's on the flip side of the left I would say it's a pseudo religion in that it is an ideology and ideology replaces religion but it's also pseudo philosophic you know their ideas really don't hold together they try to put off this image of logic and philosophical coherence I don't think they have any of it I think it's like most modern art you think it must be profound because the artist tells you that it is but if you scratch below the surface you realize it's a bunch of nonsense and I think there is a essential paradox at the heart of their ideas which is that they defend Christendom but they hate Christianity and they don't practice it so I definitely discount them as I would discount the left and I think we should disregard all of that and just read some books man and defend Western civilization and culture in a serious way and in a way that will lead us toward more ordered liberty and human dignity and more winning winning winning okay that's enough it was a rough week we will be back tomorrow join us hopefully it will be a better oh I'm sorry we'll be back on Monday hopefully it will be a better week and you can survive the weekend I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Noel's show thank you for watching you Oh pond5
