as much as you want to blame it on
stress stress cannot make anyone go bald
what stress can do just that stressful
invent can unmask the tendency if you
have pattern baldness where that will
show up everybody's under stress in
their life but once that stressor is
removed if you don't have the gene for
male pattern baldness or female pattern
baldness your hair should return say for
instance people have surgery all the
time and they'll say after surgery they
their hair sheds but it comes back
because that surgery was stressful and
after that stress is gone the hair does
come back so as far as stress I mean it
can start things it can manifest things
but it cannot be the sole cause of
someone losing their hair
