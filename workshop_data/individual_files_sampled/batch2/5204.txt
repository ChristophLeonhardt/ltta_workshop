Hidy Prez bill I want to show you some polls and get your take on three new ones that Joe referenced showing president from struggling to gain approval in his job performance with his net negative approval ratings in the double digits in all three of these polls he's upside down 13 points according to Quinnipiac with a 41 percent approval rating in CNN's poll he's upside down 11 points with a 42 percent approval rating and he's down 17 points in the Gallup poll with a 39 percent rating in their weekly tracking poll asked by the Quinnipiac poll whether they like Trump as a person 31% of voters say yes while 59 percent say they dislike him on the president's Twitter habits 26 percent believe he should continue tweeting while 66 percent think he should stop Heidi we were talking about this yesterday with a strong economy unemployment at three point nine percent you would expect president Trump to be up over 39 41 percent where he's been locked in almost from the beginning and we talked about that yesterday Willie so I took the attempt to look a little closer at these numbers and I saw a real danger zone within the numbers which was the question about what he's doing for the middle class remember this was the whole premise of his campaign was that he was going to buck the establishment that he ran against to elevate the needs of the Forgotten man according to the polling by a margin of 58 percent to 38 percent he is not doing enough to help the middle class and those white voters without college degrees among them he is now evenly split so there's no advantage for Donald Trump now in this queen Appiah Quinnipiac poll among white voters without college degrees I think that it's really notable and it speaks directly to the debate that you were just having about President Trump as a deal maker so we're now a year and a half into this presidency that was promised on helping the forgotten man and we all saw from the very beginning what happened with Donald Trump he may have come in with the best of intentions in terms of helping they've gotten man but he was immediately co-opted by that very establishment in terms of the agenda that was pushed through Congress there was no infrastructure plan the hope among Schumer and that's why he kind of held back initially hoping that maybe the president would come to him and Nancy Pelosi and do a revitalization of American infrastructure and cut a big deal with them there was none of that there was no compromise to bring better health care that's cheaper and that covers everyone there was go back to the old playbook of tax cuts for the rich and tax cuts for the rich that are even more skewed than those under Reagan and Bush and so I think that is why you're seeing these numbers move the way that they are because a lot of these people I just have this feeling that they are not their allegiances are very shallow the reason why President Trump won the Midwest was not because they all loved him so much it was because the Democrats didn't turn out and now you're starting to see those intensity numbers really move well I and you're right Heidi it's not because they love Donald Trump so much and we commented at the time that that Donald Trump liked only 35 36 % of Americans found Donald Trump to be honest and trustworthy some in the 50s they found him to be a liar and and dishonest he just happened to be running against somebody who actually had lower honest and trustworthy numbers than him pretty remarkable so Gene Robinson I want to follow up on what the Rev and Willie and and we were all talking about Donny we're talking about about knowing this guy for 10 years he and this is this the pisar thing about it he he talked about fund raisers for Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi I mean he was a Democrat might be behind closed doors he wasn't even posing for anybody he gave a ton of money to the DNC he gave money to Rahm Emanuel he did all of these things that would have allowed him to make that turn like I think a lot of those Democrats believed that he was going to make in he was always but brutish publicly and he was always shallow he was always insecure but I think everybody assumed and it was a pretty good calculation that those very qualities would make him what to be beloved so much they didn't rather have a fifty percent approval rating than a thirty nine percent approval rating but every step of the way he has chosen to narrow cast he's just called the black woman a dog he calls Latinos breeders just this year Mexicans rapists during the campaign black black countries and Jordie black continent s whole countries I mean he's done everything he can do to trap himself in the 30s yeah I mean the you said something earlier that's absolutely right I mean I've lived whenever I write really anything about but Donald Trump some people Democrats write me and say you know no don't write that don't say that that's just what he wants this is this is all a trap somehow when no it's not he didn't he didn't just you know take a pratfall down the stairs as part of some sort of evil plot and you know I think the answer to the question that you guys are posing is clearly that he's not fully in control I mean he's not my control jean-yves I gotta say really a if there's the guy's not right he's not he's not acting logically and I don't know how to say without people saying don't act like you're a doctor I'm not acting like I'm a doctor I've known the guy for ten years though nobody rationally behaves this way unless they want to get wiped out in elections unless exactly 38 39 percent approval rating right as a matter of of politics as a matter of the numbers this is an insane way to behave and and then there are other things the way these sort of what I suspect were sort of deeply buried prejudices have have have come out about Latinos about african-americans about women certainly in the way but but those those are things that you know and adult in in control of himself manages to bury manages to realize that that they're not they're not appropriate they're certainly not appropriate to sort of trumpet the way he did but he can't control those things they just they just sort of erupt out of him he learned to do one extraordinary thing during the campaign which is which is these sort of stream-of-consciousness rallies in which for a segment of the electorate they're they're catnip they are amphetamines they are whatever you boy some kind of drug that that really pump people up and that's really what he knows how to do and so that's what he'll continue to do and it and it turns out the other 60% more and more but this is not just some diabolical plot this is this is a man that's out of control if you got 39 or 40 percent you lose elections there's like don't worry he's not he's not gonna sneak up on you like he did before you know Mika and Willie and I and Mark Halperin were saying you had a chance to win the last two weeks didn't think he was going through said he had a chance to win and seriously you would have you would have thought that we said locusts we're going to be descending from the heavens and eating the flesh off of every human being in America well I'm here to tell you now a forty-percent president losses midterms and a 40% president doesn't get reelected ain't gonna happen but Reverend Al let's just wrap this up because we do have quite a few people on here who've known Donald Trump for 10 years this is what's so interesting to me Gina and we tell you talking about the guys not well gene had said before that people keep their prejudices buried when they talk certainly in public I I'm sure he never said anything appropriate to you racially but I can tell you while Donald Trump said inappropriate things behind closed doors and certainly was not a feminist behind closed doors for the decade I was with him I can that I can tell you and Mika would tell you the same thing he never once said anything remotely insensitive behind closed doors regarding race never once the first time I ever heard him say anything about it was in 2011 when he cooked when he held on to this birther conspiracy and it was like this lifelong Democrat figured out that if he played a racist and a bigot he could win the Republican nomination which of course offended me at the time because I was a Republican but I'll be damned if he didn't do it I know because you know I met him in the 80s with Don King and Mike Tyson and then I marched on them around the Central Park five kids which he was adamantly opposed to but as I got to know him he never was offensive he even came to our National Action Network conventions twice cut the ribbon one year with Geraldine Ferraro but it was the birther thing that I started saying this guy just is not genuine and I always sensed he was playing me but I didn't know that he was on the other team to Bertha and then he had Michael corn called me and sit down and say why are you saying what I'm saying is racist I said because it is and I was trying to gauge whether he was just insensitive or really racial but as time has gone on and he's hit the limits of what he's able to do you do what people do you reach inside to who you really are and these feelings are really coming out no one could call African nations in Haiti s holes or call Mexican rapists to call a black woman a dog unless that's really in them that's who he is and I think many of us gave him the benefit of a doubt that he never lived up to we knew he wasn't genuine but we didn't know who genuinely he was that's great we're putting well you know I one time but he called screaming too early during the campaign and said stop calling me a bigot on TV you know me you know I'm not a bigot and I said well Donald if you're not a bigot you're playing one on TV to get elected which actually is even worse so it doesn't really matter you know Ike always said you don't you know guess what somebody believes say you don't try to imagine what they believe look at their actions and that will tell you well Donald Trump by his actions he has shown us regardless of what he believes inside his head he's a bigot he's acting like a bigot he's ruling like a bigot and that bigot will be defeated at the polls of this fall and in two years you know that morning Joe
