1
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:10,104
STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.

2
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:18,613
NOWHERE DOES POLITICS SHAPE OUR

3
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:23,017
CULTURE THAN AT A UNIVERSITY.

4
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:28,189
I HAVE KERA O'BRYAN PRESIDENT OF

5
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,726
THE HARVARD CLUB.

6
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:35,029
LET'S START WITH CASEY.

7
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,398
>> I WAS BOO'D BY MY CLASSMATES

8
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:52,046
WHEN RECEIVING MY DIPLOMA AROUND

9
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:54,716
CAMPUS I WAS KNOWN AS THE

10
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,384
CONSERVATIVE AND ALLIACEOUS HAD

11
00:00:56,384 --> 00:01:01,289
A TRUMP/PENCE STICKER ON HI HAT.

12
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,395
STEVE: YOU WERE BOO'D.

13
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:09,030
KERA HAVE YOU HAD THAT

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,497
EXPERIENCE?

15
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:12,967
>> I HAVE HAD SEVERAL THAT'S

16
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,068
SIMILAR TO THAT.

17
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:16,304
MY CLASSMATES ARE ACCEPTING BUT

18
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:19,140
THE TEACHING ASSISTANTS HAVE

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,275
BEEN THE BIGGEST STUMBLING

20
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:21,809
BLOCK.

21
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:23,511
IN MY AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY

22
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:27,749
CLASS I HAD AN ASSISTANT THAT

23
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:30,385
ASKED IF THE COUNTRY WOULD BE

24
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:33,221
BETTER OR WORSE OFF IF HILLARY

25
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:36,758
CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT AND IT

26
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:39,160
BECAME EVIDENT THAT HE WASN'T

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,496
ASKING FUR OUR OPINION AND THE

28
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:43,398
ONLY ONE TO SAY OUR COUNTRY

29
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:45,633
WOULDN'T BE BETTER OFF.

30
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,169
HE CAME BACK AND SAID HAVE YOU

31
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:49,771
CONSIDERED THIS AND THAT AND

32
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,907
OFFERED SEVERAL OTHER SCENARIOS.

33
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:56,277
I TOLD HIM, YES.

34
00:01:56,277 --> 00:02:02,517
HE REPRIMANDED ME AND TOLD ME I

35
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,919
SHOULD RECONSIDER MY VIEWS.

36
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,587
>> YOU ARE AT HARVARD.

37
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,190
YOU ARE TOLD YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED

38
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,425
TO HAVE AN OPINION.

39
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,226
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING

40
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:13,361
WITH THE REPUBLICAN CLUB WHAT

41
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:16,964
ARE YOU DOING TO CHANGE THIS?

42
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:19,834
>> WELL, WE HOST A VARIETY OF

43
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,537
FREE SPEECH EVENTS AND HAD A

44
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,872
FORUM DISCUSSION OF POLICIES.

45
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:27,208
THE HARVARD REPUBLICAN CLUB ARE

46
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,544
WHAT CONSIDER TO BE MY FIRST

47
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:30,845
HOME ON CAMPUS.

48
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:34,182
IT'S A BROADER GROUP OF

49
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:35,817
INDIVIDUALS THAN YOU EXPECT.

50
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:38,019
THERE ARE ISSUES THAT YOU CAN

51
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,887
FIND CONSENSUS ON.

52
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:44,592
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER ON

53
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:47,528
IS AN INITIATIVE I'M THE VICE

54
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:52,066
PRESIDENT OF AS WELL.

55
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:56,537
STEVE: KASSY I READ AN ARTICLE

56
00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:58,906
YOU WROTE ABOUT A WOMAN'S MARCH.

57
00:02:58,906 --> 00:03:02,243
IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING.

58
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:05,980
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?

59
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,350
>> UNLIKE KIERA I HAD A HARD

60
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,918
TIME WITH PROFESSORS.

61
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:13,621
I DECIDED TO GO TO AN EVENT HELD

62
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:14,522
ON CAMPUS.

63
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:17,158
IT WAS THE FOUNDERS OF THE

64
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:18,559
WOMAN'S MARCH.

65
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:23,231
THEY CAME TO SPEAK ON CAMPUS AND

66
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,301
I WANTED TO GO ASK QUESTIONS.

67
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:29,604
THAT'S WHAT CONSERVATIVES DO.

68
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:31,739
I WENT TO GO IN THE EVENT AND

69
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,975
THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF STUDENTS

70
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:37,411
THERE AND I WANTED TO ASK A

71
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:37,778
QUESTIONS.

72
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:41,449
I WAS TOLD WE COULDN'T WRITE A

73
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,785
QUESTION AND WE HAD TO WRITE

74
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,255
THEM ON NOTE CARDI

75
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:47,588
THEM ON NOTE CARDS.

76
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,357
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR

77
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:52,093
THEM TO COME TO CAMPUS AND

78
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,061
DISCUSS WITH STUDENTS AND THAT'S

79
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,797
NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

80
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:57,465
STEVE: WHAT DID HAPPEN?

81
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:59,567
>> WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY

82
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,003
ANSWERED A FEW QUESTIONS FROM

83
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:02,904
STUDENTS.

84
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,505
ACTUALLY, ONE OF THEM CALLED ME

85
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,240
OUT BECAUSE I WAS TWEETING ABOUT

86
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,776
IT AND SHE WAS UPSET THAT I SAID

87
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:10,711
NOT A LOT OF STUDENTS WERE

88
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:11,012
THERE.

89
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:14,549
IT WAS A ROOM FOR 1,000 STUDENTS

90
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,385
AND I SAID MAYBE TO 100 STUDENTS

91
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,084
WERE THERE.

92
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:21,322
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER QUESTIONS AND

93
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:24,158
THEY SHARED IDEAS AND DIDN'T LET

94
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:25,059
OTHERS CHALLENGE THEM.

95
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:26,994
THESE ARE COMMUNITY ACTIVIST.

96
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,096
THEY SHOULD BE USED TO

97
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:31,332
INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE IN THE

98
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:31,699
COMMUNITY.

99
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,568
THEY JUST USED THIS PLATFORM TO

100
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,468
SHARE THEIR IDEAS.

101
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,504
STEVE: I THINK YOUR STORIES ARE

102
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:39,140
SO TYPICAL OF WHAT'S GOING ON.

103
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,478
I BELIEVE IN KIERA CASE THE

104
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:46,480
TEACHERS AND IN YOUR CASE THE

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,014
STUDENTS.

106
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:50,651
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT

107
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,587
GIVES ME OPTIMISM IS YOU ARE

108
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:53,688
BOTH THERE.

109
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:55,423
IT'S TERRIBLE TO SAY WHAT YOU

110
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,358
ARE DOING IS BRAVE.

111
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:58,492
IT REALLY IS.

112
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:00,461
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS REALLY

113
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:00,761
BRAVE.

114
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,897
YOU STAND-UP FOR WHAT YOU THINK.

115
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:05,733
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE

116
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,569
FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

117
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,006
IT'S THEIR INTOLERANCE THAT'S

118
00:05:12,006 --> 00:00:00,000
DOING THAT.
