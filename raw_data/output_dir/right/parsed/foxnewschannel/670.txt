GOOD MORNING, CANDACE,

ALL OF THIS MAKES YOU THINK
I FEEL THIS HAPPENING AND
THIS IS MAXINE WATERS'
AMERICA.

AMERICA.
THEY'RE THE PARTY OF HATE.
THEY ARE THE VIOLENT PARTY.
AND THAT THEY WISH TO SEE A
DIVIDED AMERICA.
WE DON'T SEE THEM SPEAKING
OUT AGAINST THIS IN THE WAY
THAT THEY SHOULD.
BUT, IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN
EQUAL AND OPPOSITE EFFECT.
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE TRUMP
SUPPORTERS DIG IN THEIR
HEELS AS WELL AS PEOPLE ON
THE OTHER SIDE COME OVER TO
SIDE.
PETE: CANDACE, HAVE YOU
DEALT WITH CONFRONTATIONS AS
WELL.
AS HAVE YOU COME OUT AND
TALKED MORE ABOUT WHY YOU
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.
IS THIS SOMETHING INHERENT
IN SORT OF THE BUBBLE WORLD
TO THE LEFT WHERE THEY THINK
SAFE SPACE AND THEY REALIZE
THE REST OF AMERICA MIGHT
INHERENT.
IT'S BEEN SO PERMISSIBLE.
THEY SEE SO MANY IDOLS AND
CELEBRITIES COME OUT AND
ATTACK TRUMP EVERY SINCE GEL
DAY AND IT'S ALLOWED THAT
SORT OF BEHAVIOR WASN'T
ALLOW WHEN OBAMA WAS OFFICE
N. OFFICE.
YOU DIDN'T SEE CELEBRITIES
COMING OUT AND SAYING THINGS
ABOUT IVANKA
ABOUT DVANKA
ABOUT DISNKA
ABOUT DISGUA
ABOUT DISGUSTING TERMS.
IT HAS TRICKLED DOWN AND
SEEING PEOPLE ACT IN A WAY
THAT NEVER ACTING RIGHT NOW.

WATCH THIS.
>> AMERICAN PEOPLE MUST KNOW
WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THIS
NOMINATION.
BECAUSE OVERTURNING ROE
WOULD TAKE US BACK TO THE
DAYS OF WOMEN BEING SEVERELY
INJURED AND DYING BECAUSE
THEY CAN'T GET BASIC MEDICAL
CARE.
EXACTLY.
I DON'T KNOW BUT GUYS.
I HAVE GROWN REALLY IMMUNE
TO THIS RHETORIC EVERY
SINGLE DAY THEY WAKE UP AND
THEY DECIDE WHAT THEIR
OUTRAGED ABOUT.
THEY TELL US IT'S GOING TO
BE ARMAGEDDON EVERY SINGLE
DAY.
IF TRUMP WINS THE WORLD IS
GOING TO BE OVER.
IF TRUMP DRINKS A DIET COKE
THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE
OVER.
THE STORMY DANIELS THE WORLD
IS GOING TO BE OVER.
SEARCH GROWING APATHETIC TO
THIS.
IT DOESN'T FEEL REAL.
THEY'RE ACHE ACTING AND FEAR
AMONG GORING.

TONED.

PEOPLE COMING OUT AND
SPEAKING OUT AND SAY THEY

MARGINS THAN DID HE IN 2016.
