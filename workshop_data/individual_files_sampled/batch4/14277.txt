so we wanted to find out more about busses expenses to find out if he had been sort of you know playing at the edges or pushing the limits a little bit and we got back this shocking response from the Privy Council office saying that we are withholding this information because it's personal and so this was totally not in line with the past practices of previous pmos harper martin christian and it's certainly not in line with the rest of them we know ministerial staff for instance we know that catherine McKenna's chief of staff does not have his name or her name she's me removed from the the expenses that we see in our access information so we filed another access information with the Privy Council and we asked what are the policy changes that you've made and give us the communications behind those policy changes to allow Gerald Butz to have his name redacted or his and the information redacted from our from our access to information requests and what we got back was more obstruction basically full pages of redacted notes full pages of communications it's almost as if they went out of their way to send us a bunch of redacted information to say AHA rebel you guys can't get what you're looking for here well you know Chris two things first of all how the heck does one rack up $200,000 in moving expenses going from Toronto to Ottawa I mean did Gerald button company take the same route as the ill-fated Franklin expedition and double back I don't know but but secondly we were showing some images on the screen for our viewers of the information we received back that you received back I can't find any tangible information that is of any use I mean did you get anything out of those packages because it all looks like a big mishmash of censored documents to me it's exactly what it is it's basically as I call it brazen opaqueness from the most transparent government ever it's it's ironic to me as I mentioned in the video I put out yesterday that Scott Brison who's the Treasury Board the mr. fynch on the Treasury Board and this is his file that the Information Act is actually his responsibility and he was in committee last week bragging about how you know we're here to keep make sure this information is it belongs to the public you know this is what we're doing we're making sure yet all the while the PMO's office is hiding Gerald boxes expenses from us that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra lavance show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on youtube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
