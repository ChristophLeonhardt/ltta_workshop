an entire neighborhood turned to ash and debris people no longer coming and going nobody checking their mailbox kids no longer playing in the front yard for the first time since a deadly fire ripped through his area the people of the city of Reading gathered for a community meeting the question they all were asking what next 82 year-old Joseph fabbrizio evacuated his house last week and hasn't been home since my home is still standing I'm in a motel I'm safe and that's what counts in Shasta County where reading is located the fire destroyed over 500 homes and wiped out entire communities it's still not contained the County gonna come back oh yeah eventually you know mother nature will take care of things things will regrow people will adjust but it's a it's a hard lesson when this blaze ripped through this neighborhood this home was spared but their neighbors not so much the fire totally engulfed this house all that's left are the charred remains but this is not a story about buildings that are lost it's about human suffering the people that once lived here that now have nothing else like for this woman Ruth angel her home where she lived with her family for 15 years burned down when you see that your house is gone it's like okay my life my my my kids there they grew you know grew up there the only thing keeping her going hugs of support from strangers we had so many people come to our just try to support us and love us and we love them back and there's no appreciation that you can give people that say hey we got trucks we've got we'll bring a gang of people up and we'll help you whatever you need to do in a city charred or lingering smoke from fires still blocks the sunset but not the hope of people to one day rebuild Gabriel Sandow al-jazeera Redding California
