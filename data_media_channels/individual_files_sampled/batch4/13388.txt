so now you have come through this and now so you can stand before people and tell them about a abortion but but one of the things that you write about too is in this moment of me too you really write very forcefully about the fact that trying to get the facts of the way men and women are I want to read just a little bit of a piece that you wrote that really left out at me one of the reasons I asked you to come on during this me to thing you said here's a little secret we have to say out loud women love the sexual interplay they experience with men and they relish men desiring their beauty because it is part of their nature I mean that is so simple and so obviously true and yet that has become controversial when you look at this me to movement how do you address this I know women have been mistreated I know some of these stories they tell a horrific I'm in Hollywood I know exactly how people meet women here what what do you want to say to them about that you know and I'm in the DC media so you know we know there's bad things that happen and we always have to make that caveat you know we do understand that women are hurt by men that these things happen and we don't want that to happen but we're not talking about that just with the meeting movement we're talking about a feminism movement that really is about coming in between the relationships of men and women it's about emasculating men calling masculinity toxic and ultimately it's about making women the victims in a press class does something that's really necessary in a culturally Marxist environment is to have an oppressed class and for women to really gain power in society with the sexism charges they need to show that they're victims and they need to have an oppressor that needs to be brought down so they can have power because feminism is not really about women it's about power and we have our rights today the feminist movement really should not exist as a defender of an oppressed class because we have equality in America we have respect between the sexes generally speaking we do and but the spin - movement for power needs to press the idea in the belief that women are oppressed and that's what's coming out of the the meeting movement that's why you're getting oh he just looked at me wrong and meeting or I felt his eyes Punk me oh my gosh he asked me out he may have even like touched my hand oh you know just this you know fainting couch puritanical kind of behavior from feminists here is just me strong women coming out of the sexual revolution weren't we supposed to behave just like men and have no sex just like men where did that go so but now but it is necessary because the whole sexism and feminism charge has been fading it hasn't been working not really they've tried this war on women but it doesn't always take hold not like racism does and so they really are latching on to this because we are now victims were oppressed in making bring others nasty men down who have been oppressing us with the patriarchy
