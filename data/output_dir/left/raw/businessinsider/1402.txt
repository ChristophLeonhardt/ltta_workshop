1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,370
driving over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here this morning there was</font>

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,039
a billboard that says the universe is

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,889
expanding but your closet is not so you

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,599
know go store your stuff in our storage

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,269
facility I would say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,460
remarkably happy billboard for me to see

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,500
because it is correct the universe is

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,810
expanding and your closet is not and

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,029
this is a misconception that some people

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,220
have that along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expansion of</font>

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> universe everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is expanding the</font>

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,140
earth and you and so forth in Annie Hall

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,450
Woody Allen points out that the universe

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,950
is expanding but Brooklyn<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">expanding and he and the billboard are</font>

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,480
right and the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the street might</font>

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
not be the expansion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> universe</font>

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,920
isn't something that is like pulling

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,500
apart everything it's more like the

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,180
initial conditions near the Big Bang

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,430
started everything moving apart and

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,340
things have been coasting ever since so

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,989
the fact that things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving apart in</font>

24
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,090
the universe<font color="#CCCCCC"> the expansion of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space is</font>

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,219
kind of a left over from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Big Bang</font>

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,100
but once things come together to make a

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,040
galaxy or a planet or a closet or

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,470
Brooklyn they're not expanding apart

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,500
anymore so we are staying the same size

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,020
while the universe is expanding or if

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,390
you are expanding it is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font>

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the expansion of us</font>

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:00:00,000
you
