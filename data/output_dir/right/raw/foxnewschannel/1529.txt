1
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,195
>> LAURA: THE G.O.P.'S

2
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:11,029
REVERSAL OF FORTUNES.

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:11,763
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:15,167
"ANGLE."

5
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,936
JUST THREE MONTHS AGO THREE

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,172
DEMOCRATS UP AT LEAST 15 POINTS

7
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:21,106
IN THE GENERIC CONGRESSIONAL

8
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,608
BALLOT.

9
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:24,676
WELL NOT ANYMORE.

10
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:26,845
REUTER'S GENERIC BALLOT

11
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,447
HEARTENED REPUBLICANS.

12
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:30,149
AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH

13
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:32,918
DEMOCRATS ENJOYED MORE THAN A

14
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:33,886
TEN-POINT ADVANTAGE.

15
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:35,454
NEARLY 45% SAYING THEY WOULD

16
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:37,656
VOTE FOR A DEMOCRATIC, ONLY 33%

17
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:39,158
WERE PULLED A LEVEL FOR

18
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:40,592
REPUBLICANS BUT NOW THE G.O.P.

19
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,861
HAS TAKEN THE LEAD.

20
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:44,329
THE LATEST ONLINE POLL SHOWS 39%

21
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,132
OF REGISTERED VOTERS SAYING THEY

22
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,734
WOULD VOTE REPUBLICAN AND JUST

23
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,569
36.7% SUPPORTING A DEMOCRAT.

24
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:52,838
SIX-POINT SHIFT.

25
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:53,939
SO WHY IS THIS TURNAROUND

26
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,140
HAPPENING?

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,742
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS PRETTY MUCH

28
00:00:56,742 --> 00:00:58,310
STAYING ON OFFENSE AND

29
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,879
SUPPORTING GENERALLY NOT

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,847
UNDERMINING THE PRESIDENT ON KEY

31
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:04,516
ISSUES.

32
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:06,552
BY WORKING TO KEEP THIS ECONOMY

33
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:09,221
GOING, DISMANTLING THE

34
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,322
REGULATORY SUPERSTATE THAT HURTS

35
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,456
OUR INNOVATORS AND

36
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,158
ENTREPRENEURS, BY NOT DRAGGING

37
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,227
US INTO MORE SERIOUS MILITARY

38
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:18,230
CONFLICTS, BY REFUSING TO BUCKLE

39
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,566
ON IMMIGRATION, AT LEAST SO FAR.

40
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:21,633
THE G.O.P. IS ACTUALLY GAINING

41
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,101
MOMENTUM.

42
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,536
ACCORDING TO THE COOK POLITICAL

43
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:26,505
REPORT CALIFORNIA'S 39TH AND

44
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:29,408
49TH DISTRICT HAVE BOTH SHIFTED

45
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:32,077
FROM LEAN DEMOCRATIC TO TOSS UP.

46
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:33,912
NEBRASKA'S SECOND DISTRICT MOVED

47
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:36,114
FROM TOSS-UP TO A LEANING

48
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:37,416
REPUBLICAN AND SOUTH CAROLINA'S

49
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,917
FIFTH DISTRICT MOVED FROM LIKELY

50
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:41,420
REPUBLICAN TO SOLID REPUBLICAN.

51
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,754
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS HAS

52
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,723
THROWN THE DEMOCRATS INTO A FULL

53
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:48,493
ON FROTHY PANIC.

54
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:51,029
THE PARTY OF FAILED IDEAS HAS

55
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,731
ISSUED A NEW ANTICORRUPTION

56
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:54,066
MESSAGE.

57
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:55,901
THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT DRIVES

58
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,703
THE MIDTERMS FOR THEM.

59
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:58,804
THEY HOPE IT'S GOING TO BRING

60
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:02,808
THEM SUCCESS.

61
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:03,542
IT'S BEEN SAID THAT IMITATION IS

62
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:04,309
THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY,

63
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:05,244
I WONDER WHAT PLAGIARISM GETS

64
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:07,079
YOU.

65
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,582
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN A NEW MEMO

66
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:11,783
KIND OF SEEM TO BE CHANNELING

67
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:12,784
TRUMP.

68
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:13,752
THEY ARE WRITING THIS.

69
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:14,853
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK OF

70
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:17,155
GETTING A RAW DEAL FROM

71
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:18,357
WASHINGTON.

72
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:19,324
DOES THIS ALL SOUNDS VAGUELY

73
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:20,459
FAMILIAR?

74
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,062
IT IS.

75
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:25,664
>> THE PEOPLE GOT A RAW DEAL AND

76
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,366
THEY DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER.

77
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,467
OUR GOVERNMENT IS BEING EATEN

78
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:30,636
ALIVE.

79
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:31,370
KICK THE CROOKS OUT OF

80
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,139
WASHINGTON, D.C.

81
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,374
>> LAURA: IF YOU CAN'T BEAT

82
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,209
THEM, REPEAT THEM I GUESS.

83
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,611
TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE

84
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:43,048
DEMOCRATS ARE ADOPTING AN

85
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:43,882
ANTICORRUPTION PLATFORM BECAUSE

86
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:44,750
THEY ARE THE PARTY OF

87
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,419
CORRUPTION.

88
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,520
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

89
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,488
BROUGHT YOU OBAMA'S WEAPONIZED

90
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:50,455
IRS TO TARGET CONSERVATIVES

91
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:51,657
YEARS AGO.

92
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:52,758
SAME PARTY THAT CIRCLED THE

93
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,593
WAGONS AROUND HILLARY CLINTON'S

94
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:55,661
PAY TO PLAY SCHEME AT THE

95
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:57,029
STATE DEPARTMENT WHERE

96
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,463
BLACKBERRY PHONES WERE SMASHED

97
00:02:58,463 --> 00:02:59,564
AND HARD DRIVES WERE RAISED BY

98
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:01,133
BLEACH BID.

99
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,701
LET'S NOT FORGET THE PARTY OF

100
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,935
DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ WHO,

101
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,637
WHILE RUNNING THE DNC, EMPLOYED

102
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,072
AN I.T. SPECIALIST WOULD TRY TO

103
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:09,541
FLEE TO PAKISTAN AFTER HE WIRED

104
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,976
MONEY THERE.

105
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,577
MONEY FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SAY

106
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:13,412
WAS OBTAINED ILLEGALLY.

107
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:17,649
A FEDERAL GRAND JURY INDICTED

108
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,984
HIM AND HIS WIFE ON FOUR COUNTS

109
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:20,085
LAST SUMMER, BANK FRAUD AND

110
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,020
CONSPIRACY CHARGES.

111
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,388
AND THIS IS THE PARTY, BY THE

112
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:24,189
WAY, THAT'S GOING TO ROOT OUT

113
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,391
CORRUPTION.

114
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:29,194
THE CLINTONS AND THEIR POLITICAL

115
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:32,030
SPAWN ARE SO UNSCRUPULOUS THAT

116
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,032
SUPPORTERS OF BERNIE SANDERS

117
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:37,369
FILED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

118
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,203
AGAINST THE DNC FOR RIGGING THE

119
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:43,542
PRIMARY IN HILLARY'S FAVOR.

120
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:44,643
DON'T YOU GET AN AIR OF

121
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:46,345
DESPERATION HAS BEGUN TO SETTLE

122
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:47,546
OVER THE DEMOCRATS?

123
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:48,613
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE

124
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:49,614
GUARANTEED TO STRIKE ELECTORAL

125
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:52,050
GOLD IN NOVEMBER.

126
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,251
CONGRESSMAN AL GREEN, A TEXAS

127
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:56,054
DEMOCRAT IS PROMISING THAT IF

128
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:58,490
THEY TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE

129
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,925
"THERE'S A GOOD LIKELIHOOD THERE

130
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:02,227
WILL BE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT

131
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,162
BROUGHT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

132
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:08,200
THAT'S IT?

133
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,167
THAT'S HER PLAN?

134
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,635
HOW'S THAT GOING TO GROW FOLDERS

135
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:11,470
401(K)S OR KEEP OUR

136
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,272
MANUFACTURING BOOM GOING?

137
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:17,341
IMPEACHMENT IS NOT A PRO-GROWTH

138
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,543
PLATFORM, KIDS.

139
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:20,212
AND IF THAT DOESN'T GET OUT THE

140
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,047
VOTE, SOME LIBERAL FOOT SOLDIERS

141
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:24,116
HOPE THAT ATTEMPTS AT COMEDY

142
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:25,450
WELL.

143
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,018
DEPUTY CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC

144
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,720
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, CONGRESSMAN

145
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,555
KEITH ELLISON, HE DONNED A BLOND

146
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:31,289
WIG TO IMPERSONATE THE PRESIDENT

147
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,225
RECENTLY.

148
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:35,761
WARNING, COVER YOUR PET'S EARS

149
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,962
AND PUT MASKING TAPE ON THE

150
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:38,797
WINDOWPANES.

151
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:41,366
>> ROBERT MUELLER.

152
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:44,669
I HATE THAT ROBERT MUELLER.

153
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:45,971
I'M FIRING ROBERT MUELLER.

154
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:54,079
ON FIRING ROBERT MUELLER.

155
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,080
>> LAURA: HE WILL NOT BE

156
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,947
SINGING AT HAMILTON ANYTIME

157
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,216
SOON.

158
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:02,587
THE TWO HAS FLAT, OFF KEY AS THE

159
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:06,024
REST OF THE DEMOCRATIC MESSAGE.

160
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:06,992
MY FRIENDS, THIS SHOULD BE

161
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,027
FAIRLY EASY FOR THE REPUBLICANS.

162
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:10,395
THERE'S A GREAT SENSE OF

163
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:10,996
OPTIMISM IN THE COUNTRY.

164
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:11,730
IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE AN

165
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,330
AMERICAN.

166
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,198
I THINK THERE'S NO BETTER TIME

167
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:14,032
THEN MAYBE IN THE '80S DURING

168
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:15,600
REAGAN.

169
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,468
SO IT'S TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON

170
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:18,370
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

171
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,738
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S POPULIST

172
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:23,008
PRO-GROWTH AGENDA.

173
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:26,778
THE G.O.P. AT THE SAME TIME MUST

174
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:27,512
ALSO AVOID ANY SELF-INFLICTED

175
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:28,847
WOUNDS BEFORE THE MIDTERM,

176
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,415
PROMOTING OR PASSING AN AMNESTY

177
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,584
PLAN FOR GOING WEEK ON CHINA.

178
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:35,520
THAT COULD ACTUALLY DISHEARTEN

179
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,755
THE BASE.

180
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:37,856
IT COULD BREAK FAITH WITH THE

181
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,424
BLUE-COLLAR WORKERS WHO SWEPT

182
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:40,992
THE PRESIDENT AND THE G.O.P.

183
00:05:40,992 --> 00:00:00,000
INTO OFFICE AND PUT AGAIN IF YOU
