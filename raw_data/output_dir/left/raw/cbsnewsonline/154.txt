1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:03,470
IS NOT TALKING ABOUT THE IG

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:03,803
REPORT.

3
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:04,504
THERE WAS ANOTHER HEARING

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,439
YESTERDAY ON CAPITOL HILL.

5
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:07,574
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING THE

6
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,875
MEDIA WOULD RATHER FOCUS ON

7
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,977
IMMIGRATION AND ALL THESE OTHER

8
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,678
THINGS.

9
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,445
YET THIS YOUR REPORTING

10
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,012
YESTERDAY YOU SPECIFICALLY

11
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,748
REPORTING ON THE FINDINGS OF THE

12
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:16,181
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

13
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,283
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OUR VIEWERS

14
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,918
THROUGH THAT AND WHAT ULTIMATELY

15
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,253
THE RESULTS OF THAT HEARING

16
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:20,453
WERE?

17
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,988
>> YES THIS MORNING I GOT UP AT

18
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:22,255
5:00 A.M.

19
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,191
TO REPORT FOR CBS THIS

20
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,259
MORNING ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

21
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,060
REPORT.

22
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,462
LAST NIGHT I WAS HERE UNTIL

23
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:29,829
ABOUT 8:00 P.M.

24
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:30,196
ON ADDITIONAL

25
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,397
FINDINGS FROM THE INSPECTOR

26
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:32,031
GENERAL REPORT.

27
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,367
I THINK WE ALSO MANAGED TO COVER

28
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,435
IMMIGRATION YESTERDAY AS WELL.

29
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,203
THE PRESIDENT IS UPSET THAT THE

30
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,938
IMMIGRATION DEBATE IS

31
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,773
DISTRACTING FROM A LARGER

32
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:42,909
CONTROVERSY OVER AN FBI AGENT

33
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:43,442
NAMED PETER STRZOK.

34
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:45,645
HE WORKED ON THE CLINTON EMAIL

35
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:51,851
INVESTIGATION AND ALSO THE

36
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:52,184
RUSSIA PROBE.

37
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:55,955
AND HE SUBSEQUENTLY WENT TO WORK

38
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,456
FOR ROBERT MUELLER.

39
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:58,358
ANTI-TRUMP TEXT MESSAGES WERE

40
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,292
EXCHANGED BETWEEN STRZOK AND

41
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,261
LISA PAIGE WHO ALSO WORKED ON

42
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:01,694
THIS INVESTIGATION.

43
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,162
NOW MANY OF THESE NEW TEXT

44
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:05,765
MESSAGES WERE UNCOVERED IN AN

45
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,298
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT.

46
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:06,899
THAT'S AN INTERNAL WATCHDOG.

47
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:07,767
HE WORKS AT THE JUSTICE

48
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,068
DEPARTMENT AND HE SPENT THE LAST

49
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,638
YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS

50
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,939
REVIEWING HOW THE FBI HANDLED

51
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,641
THIS INVESTIGATION INTO CLINTON

52
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,476
'S USE OF A PRIVATE SERVER.

53
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:19,446
THEY PUBLISHED A 500 PAGE REPORT

54
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:27,687
LAST THURSDAY WHICH I READ AND

55
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,690
HAVE REPORTING ON EXTENSABLY.

56
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,258
ONE OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IS

57
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,260
STRZOK, PAIGE, AND THREE OTHER

58
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,995
OFFICIALS WERE RECOMMENDED FOR

59
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:36,963
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE

60
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,965
OF THESE ANTI-TRUMP TEXT

61
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,232
MESSAGES.

62
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,667
AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ON THE

63
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,301
PART OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

64
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,635
THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN BIAS

65
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,805
THAT INFLUENCED THEIR WORK AT

66
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,339
THE FBI.

67
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,675
>> WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PETER

68
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,309
STRZOK NOW?

69
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,211
>> HE'S CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF

70
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:53,446
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS WITHIN

71
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:53,613
FBI.

72
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,148
WE LEARNED HE WAS ESCORTED OUT

73
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,983
OF THE FBI BUILDING ON FRIDAY.

74
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:58,985
HE IS STILL TECHNICALLY

75
00:01:58,985 --> 00:01:59,252
EMPLOYED.

76
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,020
HE WAS KICKED OFF THE MUELLER

77
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,254
PROBE AFTER THESE TEXTS WERE

78
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:04,657
UNCOVERED AND REASSIGNED TO THE

79
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:05,224
HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT.

80
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,094
HE IS GOING TO FIGHT FOR HIS

81
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:08,259
JOB.

82
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:08,894
I INTERVIEWED HIS LAWYER LAST

83
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:10,295
NGHT AND HE SAID STRZOK WILL

84
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,031
CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO WORK AT THE

85
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,534
FBI WHERE HE HAS WORKED FOR

86
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:14,867
20 YEARS.

87
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,437
ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S

88
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,372
VERY UNLIKELY MR. STRZOK WILL BE

89
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,707
ABLE TO RECLAIM HIS JOB AFTER

90
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,975
THIS DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATION

91
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:23,509
GOES THROUGH.

92
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,945
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT

93
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,813
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, EVEN AN

94
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,314
INDEPENDENT WATCHDOG IS ACCUSING

95
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:33,319
HIM OF TAINTING TWO OF THE MOST

96
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,120
POLITICALLY SENSITIVE

97
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,154
INVESTIGATIONS IN U.S. HISTORY.

98
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,422
BUT HIS LAWYER SAYS HE WANTS TO

99
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,258
GO BEFORE CONGRESS, HE WANTS TO

100
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,959
TESTIFY, HE WANTS TO TESTIFY.

101
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,294
AND HE DOES NOT WANT REPUBLICANS

102
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,228
PAINTING HIM OR HIS ACTIONS

103
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:42,495
UNFAIRLY.

104
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,765
THIS IS NOT THE LAST WE HAVE

105
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:46,165
HEAR OF HIM.

106
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:50,970
WE SHOULD HEAR FROM HIM BEFORE

107
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,338
CONGRESS IN A FEW WEEKS.

108
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,307
>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE

109
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,376
ARE RECEIVING POOL NOTES WHO ARE

110
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,276
VIEWERS WHO ARE NOT AWARE.

111
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:01,047
>> I'LL PICK UP MY PHONE TO READ

112
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:01,280
THEM.

113
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,716
>> POOL NOTES ARE THE POOL OF

114
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,484
REPORTERS MONITORING WHAT

115
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,852
HAPPENS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

116
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,655
AND THEY'RE REPORTING WHAT THE

117
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,122
PRESIDENT IS SAYING.

118
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,957
WE'LL GET THAT PLAYED BACK FOR

119
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:11,791
OUR VIEWERS AT SOME POINT.

120
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,093
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCORDING TO

121
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,962
THE POOL NOTES SAYING TO

122
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:16,696
REPORTERS AND SOME MEMBERS OF

123
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,231
CONGRESS WHO ARE THERE AS WELL

124
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:23,369
AS SOME MEMBERS OF THE CABINET

125
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,004
THAT THE DILEMMA IS IF YOU'RE

126
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,372
WEAK THE COUNTRY WILL BE

127
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:26,905
OVERWHELMING WITH PEOPLE.

128
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,941
IF YOU'RE STRONG YOU DON'T HAVE

129
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:29,809
ANY HEARTS.

130
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,645
PERHAPS I WOULD LIKE TO BE

131
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:32,979
STRONG.

132
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,447
SENATOR TOM COTTON ALSO SPOKE

133
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,314
AND SUGGESTED THAT CHILDREN

134
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:38,318
QUOTE CAN'T BE A GET OUT OF JAIL

135
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,519
FREE CARD FOR IMMIGRANTS.

136
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,020
AND AGAIN IT JUST SORT OF

137
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,821
HIGHLIGHTS THE DISTINCTION

138
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,022
THATS BEING MADE HERE THAT

139
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,891
PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME TO THIS

140
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,926
COUNTRY FOR A BETTER LIFE

141
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,294
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE

142
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,395
HORRIFIC CONDITIONS IN THEIR

143
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,797
COUNTRIES THAT THERE ARE SOME

144
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,864
PEOPLE WHO WOULD BELIEVE THAT

145
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,166
THEY'RE USING THEIR CHILDREN AS

146
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,101
SOME KIND OF A PAWN OR SOME KIND

147
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,771
OF A CARD OR A GET OUT OF JAIL

148
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,974
FREE CARD.

149
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:05,745
WHEN IN REALITY THE DANGER WOULD

150
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,413
B LEAVING YOUR CHILDREN IN A

151
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,447
PLACE THAT'S NOT AS FREE AS YOU

152
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:10,049
WOULD BE HERE IN THE UNITED

153
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:10,282
STATES.

154
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,818
BUT THAT IS THE NOTE COMING OUT

155
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,319
OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

156
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,621
SO WE'RE EXPECTING TO GET THAT

157
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,923
TAPE PLAYED BACK VERY, VERY

158
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:18,257
SOON.

159
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,726
APPARENTLY IN THE ROOM THE

160
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:24,564
SECRETARY OF STATE, LAWMAKERS

161
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,665
INCLUDE SENATOR GRAHAM, SENATOR

162
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,065
ALEXANDER, CORNYN.

163
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,700
SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

164
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,469
OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN THE

165
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:29,836
ROOM.

166
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,669
>> AND JUST SORT OF AN ADDED

167
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,740
NUGGET ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR

168
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,040
POOL NOTES.

169
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,408
HE ALSO ANNOUNCED HE'S

170
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,476
CANCELLING THE ANNUAL

171
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:36,943
CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC.

172
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,212
THE REASON WHY IT JUST DOESN'T

173
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:39,512
FEEL RIGHT.

174
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,147
THIS IS A QUOTE IT DOESN'T FEEL

175
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,849
RIGHT TO HAVE A PICNIC FOR

176
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,983
CONGRESS.

177
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:50,156
AND AS WE SPECULATE AS TO WHAT

178
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,258
PROMPTED THIS, ONCE AGAIN WE

179
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,626
KNOW HE'S GOING TO SIGN

180
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:53,893
SOMETHING.

181
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,261
AS WE SPECULATE AS TO WHAT

182
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,196
PROMPTED THIS, I WONDER IF SOME

183
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,133
OF THE PUSHBACK ON SOCIAL MEDIA

184
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,468
HAS HAD AN IMPACT.

185
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,703
YOU KNOW HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA

186
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,271
TWEETED OUT SOME IMAGES FOR

187
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,372
FATHERS DAY OF HER CHILDREN.

188
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:16,849
AND IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS AN ON

189
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:17,649
ONSLAUGHT OF PUSHBACK.

190
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:20,787
AS THE KIDS SAY IT'S NOT A GOOD

191
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,156
LOOK TO BE OUT THERE PICNICKING

192
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,424
WHILE CHILDREN ARE OUT THERE

193
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,626
CRYING AND BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM

194
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,292
THEIR PARENTS.

195
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,794
>> THE CORE OF THAT IS

196
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:29,295
CONGRESSIONAL INACTION.

197
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,231
AND THAT'S A LOT OF THE TRUMP

198
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,332
PLATFORM, DRAINING THE SWAMP,

199
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,967
GETTING RID OF THE GRIDLOCK

200
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:35,534
THAT'S NOT SERVING PEOPLE.

201
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,836
YOU DON'T NEED THE CRISIS AT THE

202
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,371
BORDER TO KNOW THAT A LOT OF

203
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,140
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE VERY

204
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,877
IMPRESSED TO SEE MEMBERS OF

205
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,012
CONGRESS EATING SANDWICHES AND

206
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,346
DRINKING SODA WHILE THEY'RE NOT

207
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,314
ACTUALLY PASSING ANYTHING TO

208
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,050
SOLVE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THE

209
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,584
U.S. IS FACING.

210
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,052
AND TODAY WHAT'S TOP OF MIND IS

211
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:54,353
IMMIGRATION.

212
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,823
SO AS AN OPTICS MATTER IT MAKES

213
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:58,791
SENSE TO CANCEL THAT PICNIC.

214
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,461
>> AND THE FACT IS THAT MANY

215
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,364
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY RANGING

216
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,132
FROM REPUBLICANS TO DEMOCRATS TO

217
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,034
RELIGIOUS LEADERS ARE ALL COMING

218
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,200
OUT.

219
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,402
FORMER FIRST LADIES WERE COMING

220
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,939
OUT AGAINST IT AS LAURA BUSH

221
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,306
DID.

222
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,106
EVEN MELANIA, THE CURRENT FIRST

223
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:14,840
LADY TWEETED SOMETHING THAT

224
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,276
SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT SHE WAS

225
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:17,977
NOT AS SUPPORTIVE.

226
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,179
>> AT LEAST THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE

227
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,315
THE IDEA OF FAMILIES BEING

228
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:22,882
SEPARATED.

229
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
>> SO WE HAVE SOME TAPE PLAY

230
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,885
BACK FROM EARLIER TODAY WHERE

231
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,653
DEMOCRATS WERE TALKING ABOUT

232
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,855
THIS ON THE HILL.

233
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,655
SOME OF THEM GOT VERY

234
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:29,955
PASSIONATE.

235
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,424
I WANT TO PLAY THAT THEN WE'LL

236
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:31,757
TALK ABOUT IT.

237
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,159
>> AS TO ALL OF THE YOUNG

238
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:41,901
PEOPLE, TO ALL OF THE CHILDREN,

239
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,972
WE ARE GETTING IN TO SET PEOPLE

240
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,172
FREE.

241
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,441
HISTORY WILL NOT BE KIND TO US.

242
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,343
THIS HAS GONE ON TOO LONG.

243
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,410
AND IT MUST STOP.

244
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,612
IT MUST STOP NOW.

245
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,146
NOT TOMORROW BUT NOW.

246
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,647
NOW IS THE TIME TO DO WHAT IS

247
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:58,885
RIGHT, WHAT IS FAIR, AND WHAT IS

248
00:06:58,885 --> 00:06:59,085
JUST.

249
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,722
>> CHILD ABUSE IS A VIOLATION OF

250
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,055
HUMAN RIGHTS.

251
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,223
AND THE WORLD IS WATCHING.

252
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,527
>> THIS IS NOT A 0 TOLERANCE

253
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,361
POLICY.

254
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,462
WHAT IT IS IS A 0 HUMANITY

255
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:10,696
POLICY.

256
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,800
IT HAS TO STOP AND IT HAS TO

257
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,334
STOP NOW.

258
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,870
>> I NEVER THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD

259
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,943
HAVE A DAY WHERE CHILDREN ARE

260
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:28,181
BEING USED AS LEVERAGE, AS

261
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,381
PAWNS, FOR RANSOM.

262
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:30,282
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOLERATED.

263
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,485
WE HAVE TO STOP THAT BEFORE THE

264
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:32,752
ELECTION.

265
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:37,089
BUT WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER WHAT

266
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:37,657
HAPPENED HERE.

267
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,824
>> SO DEMOCRATS, VERY

268
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:39,124
PASSIONATE.

269
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:43,129
AND A SHORT TIME AFTER THAT U

270
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:43,796
PAUL RYAN SPOKE TO REPORTERS.

271
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,531
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF

272
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,267
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN RESPONSE

273
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,802
TO THIS PENDING LITIGATION

274
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,902
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT FORTH.

275
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:53,673
>> THIS BILL IS PLAN B FOR US TO

276
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,273
BEGIN WITH.

277
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,242
BY THE WAY IT SOLVES DACA IN A

278
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,509
VERY ELEGANT WAY I THINK.

279
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,178
IT'S A VERY ELEGANT SOLUTION FOR

280
00:07:59,178 --> 00:07:59,411
DACA.

281
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:00,779
SO WE'RE FOCUSSED ON GETTING

282
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:01,580
THIS BILL PASSED.

283
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,715
THE PRESIDENT CAME TO OUR

284
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,549
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY AND ASKED

285
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,351
MEMBERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL.

286
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,151
THAT IS OUR FOCUS.

287
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:06,953
IF OTHER THINGS HAPPEN WE'LL

288
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,055
CROSS THOSE BRIDGES WHEN WE GET

289
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:09,421
TO IT.

290
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,123
>> THE DEMOCRATS TALKED A BIT

291
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,558
ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THE

292
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,526
LEGISLATION.

293
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,795
WE DIDN'T PLAY ANY OF THAT.

294
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,263
BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN

295
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,431
SAYING THE DEMOCRATS WON'T SIGN

296
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,731
LEGISLATION.

297
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,433
SO THIS IS THE LEGISLATION PAUL

298
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,034
RYAN IS TALKING ABOUT.

299
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,337
IT'S CALLED THE COMPROMISE BILL.

300
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,972
BUT PAULA IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A

301
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,042
COMPROMISE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND

302
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,211
REPUBLICANS IT'S A COMPROMISE

303
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,111
BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND MORE

304
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:33,946
HARDLINE CONSERVATIVE

305
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,648
REPUBLICANS WHO NOT ONLY WANT TO

306
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,417
CUT DOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

307
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,351
BUT ALSO LEGAL IMMIGRATION.

308
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,184
>> EXACTLY.

309
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:42,421
THAT'S WHERE THE TENSION IS.

310
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,990
THE DEMOCRATS SEEM UNITED ON

311
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,992
THEIR MESSAGE BUT WITHIN THE

312
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,728
REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE ARE SHARP

313
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,629
DIVIDES.

314
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,964
THERE ARE MORE MODERATE

315
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,065
REPUBLICANS WHO WANT PROTECTIONS

316
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:53,398
FOR DREAMERS.

317
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,201
THEN THEY'RE STANDING SIDE BY

318
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,802
SIDE WITH IMMIGRATION

319
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:57,135
HARDLINERS.

320
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,638
AND THIS WAS A CORE TENANT OF

321
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,906
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PLATFORM WITH

322
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,141
STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF OUR

323
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:02,675
IMMIGRATION LAWS.

324
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,476
ALONG WITH A WALL, BORDER

325
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:03,743
SECURITY.

326
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,446
THIS WAS A BIG PART OF WHY A LOT

327
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,681
OF PEOPLE SUPPORTED THE

328
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:08,948
PRESIDENT.

329
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:09,815
WHILE CLEARLY WE SAW IN THAT

330
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,385
FIRST CLIP THERE WERE A LOT OF

331
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,285
PEOPLE EMOTIONAL OVER THIS

332
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:13,653
POLICY.

333
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,488
THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF OTHER

334
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:23,396
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IT IS AN

335
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,665
ESSENTIAL DETERRENT TO THE WORLD

336
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,633
THAT THE U.S. IS ENFORCING

337
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,033
IMMIGRATION LAWS.

338
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,268
IT PUTS REPUBLICANS IN A

339
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,303
CRITICAL SPOT DURING A CRITICAL

340
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:31,804
ELECTION YEAR.

341
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,472
>> SO BEYOND THE RHETORIC THAT

342
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,541
HAS BEEN USED BY DEMOCRATS, BY

343
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,443
REPUBLICANS, BY THE PRESIDENT OF

344
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,646
THE UNITED STATES HIMSELF, MANY

345
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,580
REASONABLE PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW

346
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,085
WOULD AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO

347
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,986
BE A FIX TO IMMIGRATION.

348
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:48,988
AND PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS HAVE

349
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,288
TRIED.

350
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:49,955
PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED, PRESIDENT

351
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,123
BUSH TRIED AND WERE NOT ABLE TO

352
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,160
GET THE BALL OVER THE GOAL LINE.

353
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,594
BUT IF YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT

354
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:58,097
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

355
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,731
BUBBLED UP OVER THE LAST

356
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,299
18 MONTHS OR SO THEY ARE A

357
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,334
DIRECT RESULT OF SOME OF THE

358
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:07,306
ACTIONS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

359
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,674
HAS TAKEN INCLUDING THE ISSUE

360
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,009
WITH THE DREAMERS RIGHT NOW.

361
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,811
IF THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAD NOT

362
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,845
GIVEN CONGRESS AN ARTIFICIAL

363
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,648
TIMETABLE TO FIX THAT ISSUE WE

364
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,683
WOULDN'T BE WHERE THEY ARE TODAY

365
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,584
WITH ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES.

366
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,586
IF THE PRESIDENT THROUGH THE

367
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,420
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD NOT

368
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,855
IMPLEMENTED THIS 0 TOLERANCE

369
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,456
POLICY BACK IN APRIL.

370
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:27,460
HE WOULDN'T BE FACING WHAT SOME

371
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,027
WOULD ARGUE RIGHT NOW AND AGAIN

372
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:31,363
IT SEEMS THERE'S ALWAYS

373
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:31,863
SOMETHING EVERY WEEK.

374
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,933
BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST

375
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,900
SIGNIFICANT CRISIS OF HIS

376
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,133
POLICY.

377
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,204
>> BUT THIS IS SORT OF PART OF

378
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,372
THE PRESIDENT'S TACTICS.

379
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,338
WHEN IT CAME TO DACA HE

380
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:43,209
DELIBERATELY ENDED THE DACA

381
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,044
PROTECTIONS IN THE HOPES OF

382
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,013
FORCING CONGRESS TO HAMMER OUT

383
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,682
SOME SORT OF COMPREHENSIVE

384
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,383
IMMIGRATION POLICY OR

385
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:51,783
IMMIGRATION LAW.

386
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:52,484
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

387
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:53,819
THE DEADLINE CAME AND WENT.

388
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,688
AND WHAT YOU SEE WITH THIS

389
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,556
COMPROMISE BILL AND YOU HEARD

390
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,824
PAUL RYAN REALLY HIGHLIGHT THE

391
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,392
DACA COMPONENT OF IT BECAUSE

392
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:04,764
THAT'S WHAT PROMPTED ALL OF

393
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,664
THESE DISCUSSIONS THIS DACA

394
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,498
PROTECTION ENDING.

395
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,933
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIM IN THE

396
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,235
MEANWHILE ANOTHER VERY PRESSING

397
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,035
ISSUE BUBBLED TO THE SURFACE.

398
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:12,638
IT SEEMS TO BE PART OF THE

399
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,373
PRESIDENT'S TACTIC TO SORT OF

400
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,108
CREATE A CRISIS TO ENCOURAGE

401
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,377
CONGRESS TO ACT.

402
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:18,977
BUT ON IMMIGRATION IT'S NOT

403
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:19,211
WORKING.

404
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,345
>> THAT COULD BE PART OF IT.

405
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:24,683
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT

406
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,219
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE BORDER.

407
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:31,056
ONE OF THE ACHEECHLTS OF THE

408
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,993
PRESIDENT'S FIRST YEAR WAS THAT

409
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,629
ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS WERE

410
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,362
DOWN BY THE DOUBLE DIGITS.

411
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,264
BUT THERE WAS AN UP TICK AND

412
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,132
THAT WAS A SIGNAL TO THE CHIEF

413
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,268
OF STAFF JOHN KELLY AND ATTORNEY

414
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,302
GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS THAT THIS

415
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,404
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO

416
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,405
IMPLEMENT A POLICY THEY HAD BEEN

417
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,940
CONSIDERING FOR WELL OVER A YEAR

418
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,209
WHICH IS A 0 TOLERANCE POLICY

419
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,611
AND USING SEPARATING FAMILIES AS

420
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:52,911
A DETERRENT.

421
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:56,215
THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS ON THE

422
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,953
RECORD SAYING THIS IS A

423
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,220
DETERRENT.

424
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,521
THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY SAID THEY

425
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,923
BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE A

426
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:04,190
DETERRENT.

427
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,258
IN MANY WAYS THEY HAVE WANTED TO

428
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,493
DO THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

429
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:11,397
AND THE FACT THAT ILLEGAL BORDER

430
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,030
CROSSINGS WERE INCREASING GAVE

431
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,065
THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT

432
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,500
HOWEVER IT IS THE PRESIDENT AND

433
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,468
SOME OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN

434
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:18,904
CONGRESS WHO WILL BEAR THE

435
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,573
ULTIMATE POLITICAL PRICE OF

436
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,873
THOSE PICTURES AND THE AUDIO OF

437
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,475
THOSE THINGS WE'RE SEEING COMING

438
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:24,109
UP FROM THE BORDER.

439
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,010
TALKING WITH THE PRESIDENT IN

440
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,412
THE PAST WEEK HE DID THAT GAGGLE

441
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,916
ON FRIDAY AND CAME DOWN AND TALK

442
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,283
TODAY US.

443
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,953
HE DIDN'T SEEM READ IN ON THE

444
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:34,353
VARIOUS PROPOSALS.

445
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,055
HE SAID HE DIDN'T REALLY LIKE

446
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:36,755
SEPARATING FAMILIES BUT HE

447
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,423
SEEMED SQUAREL FOCUSSED ON

448
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,025
NORTH KOREA AND THE ECONOMY AND

449
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,260
HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THOSE

450
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,527
REALMS.

451
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,195
THIS DID NOT SEEM TO BE

452
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,496
SOMETHING THAT HE WAS ESPECIALLY

453
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:44,896
FOCUSSED ON.

454
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,933
AND PERHAPS THAT IS PART OF WHY

455
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,869
HE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH

456
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,203
POLITICAL BLOWBACK THERE WOULD

457
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,938
BE WHEN THIS WAS ACTUALLY

458
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,206
IMPLEMENT AND HAD PEOPLE STARTED

459
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,374
SEEING PICTURES AND HEARING THE

460
00:12:55,374 --> 00:13:00,346
STORIES OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN

461
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,013
SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS.

462
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,350
>> THE PRESIDENT DID TWEET TODAY

463
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,885
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

464
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,387
NORTH KOREA AS MUCH AS HE

465
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,020
EXPECTED THEY WOULD BE.

466
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,823
AGAIN AS YOU'RE READING ALONG

467
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,558
WITH US HERE ON YOUR PHONE YOU

468
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,326
HAVE SEEN THE POOL NOTES THE

469
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,928
MOST RECENT POOL NOTE NUMBER SIX

470
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,495
OF THE PRESIDENT TAKING

471
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,430
QUESTIONS AND CONFIRMING THAT HE

472
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,199
WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

473
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,534
GOING ON TO SAY THAT THE IMAGES

474
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,236
THAT HAVE BEEN FLASHING ACROSS

475
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,573
TELEVISION SCREENS HERE AND

476
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,340
AROUND THE WORLD EFFECT

477
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,607
EVERYONE.

478
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,708
OF COURSE WENT BACK AND BLAMED

479
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,976
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYING

480
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,944
YOU HAVE DOUBLE STANDARDS.

481
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,846
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR

482
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:35,113
50 YEARS.

483
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,683
PAULA, YOU WILL KNOW AS WELL AS

484
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,919
SOME OF OUR VIEWERS THAT

485
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,221
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID FACE

486
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,956
INCREASED SPIKES IN ILLEGAL

487
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,156
IMMIGRATION DURING HIS TERMS IN

488
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:45,557
OFFICE.

489
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:48,460
AND THERE WAS THAT NICKNAME THAT

490
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,263
WAS FLOATED FOR MANY, MANY YEARS

491
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,364
DEPORTER IN CHIEF.

492
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:52,965
PRESIDENT OBAMA DEPORTED MORE

493
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,199
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THE

494
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,303
UNITED STATES THAN ANY OTHER

495
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:57,970
PREVIOUS PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM.

496
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,606
BUT HERE THE PRESIDENT OF COURSE

497
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,374
SAYING THAT THIS PROBLEM ALL

498
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,074
BEGAN BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT

499
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:05,344
OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS

500
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:05,911
ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

501
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,382
THE QUESTION OF COURSE IS EVEN

502
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,917
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA DEPORTED

503
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:12,884
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HE DIDN'T

504
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,854
SEPARATE CHILDREN, TODDLERS,

505
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:16,689
YOUNG KIDS FROM THEIR

506
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,189
PARTICIPANTS.

507
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,824
>> WELL THERE WERE ASPECTS OF

508
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,392
THAT POLICY ACTUALLY THAT DID

509
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:25,297
HAVE TO BE CARRIED OUT AFTER THE

510
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,867
FLORES DECISION IN THE NINTH

511
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,967
CIRCUIT AFTER THAT DECISION CAME

512
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:29,435
DOWN.

513
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,269
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS

514
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:30,669
BEHOLDEN TO THAT.

515
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,905
BUT ONE WAY TO GET AROUND THAT

516
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,540
IS TO NOT CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE

517
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,344
PEOPLE WHO COME ACROSS THE

518
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,011
BORDER ILLEGALLY.

519
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,881
YOU HANDLE IT AS A CIVIL MATTER

520
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,385
AND THEN PEOPLE ARE NOT

521
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:46,785
INCARCERATED.

522
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,385
THAT'S REALLY THE DIFFERENCE

523
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,086
BETWEEN THE 0 TOLERANCE POLICY

524
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,722
AND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE

525
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,023
FINAL DAYS OF THE OBAMA

526
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,891
ADMINISTRATION IS THEY HAVE NOW

527
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,593
DECIDED TO CRIMINALLY PROSECUTE

528
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:54,826
PEOPLE.

529
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,729
KIDS CAN'T GO TO JAIL, THEY

530
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,564
CAN'T BE INCARCERATED FOR CRIMES

531
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,799
THAT'S WHY FAMILIES NEED TO BE

532
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,200
SEPARATED.

533
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,401
THAT'S A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN

534
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,602
HOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

535
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,771
HANDLED THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS

536
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,740
AND HOW THE SESSIONS JUSTICE

537
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,640
DEPARTMENT DECIDED TO PROCEED.

538
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,576
>> WE'RE ABOUT 42ndS OR SO AWAY

539
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,710
FROM THE TAPE PLAYBACK OF THE

540
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,878
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

541
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,147
TALKING TO REPORTERS WITH SOME

542
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,951
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THERE WITH

543
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,151
HIM.

544
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:19,885
SO THAT WILL ROLL OUT.

545
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,186
WE'LL WATCH WHAT THE PRESIDENT

546
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,356
HAS TO SAY THEN WE'LL COME BACK

547
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,325
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT ACTION HE

548
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,161
MAY POTENTIALLY BE TAKING TO END

549
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,062
WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

550
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,597
SEEING FLASH ACROSS YOUR SCREENS

551
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,065
OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

552
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,434
AND FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD

553
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,735
HAS DISTURBED PEOPLE IN

554
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,168
SIGNIFICANT WAYS.

555
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:38,704
SO WE'RE EXPECTING THAT TAPE

556
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,706
PLAYBACK VERY, VERY SOON.

557
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,275
YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT.

558
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:48,380
LET'S GO AND WATCH THE

559
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,914
PRESIDENT.

560
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:49,948
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH

561
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:50,215
EVERYBODY.

562
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,416
I'LL BE LEAVING FOR MINNESOTA

563
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:51,617
TODAY.

564
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,050
WE HAVE TWO STOPS.

565
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,385
ONE A VERY BIG ONE AND IT WILL

566
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,353
BE A LOT OF FUN.

567
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,821
I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE GOING

568
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,291
WITH US SO THAT WILL BE

569
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,459
INTERESTING.

570
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,759
WE'RE MEETING RIGHT NOW ON

571
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,060
IMMIGRATION.

572
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,330
AND WE ARE VERY STRONG AT THE

573
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:05,563
BORDER.

574
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,165
WE'RE VERY STRONG ON SECURITY.

575
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,635
WE WANT SECURITY FOR OUR

576
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:09,868
COUNTRY.

577
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,768
THE REPUBLICANS WANT SECURITY

578
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:14,239
AND INSIST ON SECURITY FOR OUR

579
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:14,472
COUNTRY.

580
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:15,607
AND WE WILL HAVE THAT AT THE

581
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,776
SAME TIME WE HAVE COMPASSION, WE

582
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,510
WANT TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER.

583
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,178
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

584
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:21,580
I'LL BE SIGNING SOMETHING IN A

585
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,682
LITTLE WHILE THAT'S GOING TO DO

586
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:23,916
THAT.

587
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,584
AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WANT

588
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,386
TO DO THAT AND THEY'RE WORKING

589
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,254
ON VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION

590
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,656
TO GET IT DONE.

591
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,191
BUT I'LL BE DOING SOMETHING

592
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,293
THAT'S SOMEWHAT PREEMPTIVE BUT

593
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,627
ULTIMATELY WILL BE MATCHED BY

594
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:36,395
LEGISLATION I'M SURE.

595
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,063
WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS

596
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,032
WITH DEMOCRATS, THEY DON'T WANT

597
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:40,832
TO VOTE FOR ANYTHING.

598
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,267
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT LACK OF

599
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:42,868
SECURITY.

600
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:43,969
THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE

601
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,071
OPEN BORDERS WHERE ANYBODY IN

602
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,906
THE WORLD CAN JUST FLOW IN

603
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,374
INCLUDING FROM THE MIDDLE EAST,

604
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,710
FROM ANYBODY ANYWHERE THEY CAN

605
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,879
JUST FLOW INTO OUR COUNTRY.

606
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,846
TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

607
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:55,480
TREMENDOUS CRIME CAUSED BY THAT.

608
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,248
WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT.

609
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,885
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

610
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,955
WE'RE ALL SO BUSY AND I JUST

611
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,189
MENTIONED TO THE CONGRESSMAN AND

612
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,961
THE SENATORS IN THE ROOM THAT WE

613
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,464
ARE GOING TO CANCEL AND POSTPONE

614
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,897
TOMORROWS CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC.

615
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:15,233
WE HAVE A CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC

616
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:15,501
TOMORROW.

617
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,935
AND I WAS JUST WALKING OVER TO

618
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,002
THE OVAL OFFICE AND I SAID YOU

619
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:21,406
KNOW IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO

620
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:24,108
HAVE A PICNIC FOR CONGRESS WHEN

621
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:24,876
WE'RE WORKING ON DOING SOMETHING

622
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:25,242
VERY IMPORTANT.

623
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,311
WE HAVE MANY THINGS THAT ARE

624
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:27,713
IMPORTANT.

625
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,480
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRADE.

626
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,082
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANY, MANY

627
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:30,749
THINGS.

628
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,051
BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL EXACTLY RIGHT

629
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:33,318
TO ME.

630
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,388
SO WE WILL BE OFFICIALLY

631
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,623
POSTPONING THE CONGRESSIONAL

632
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,256
PICNIC FOR TOMORROW.

633
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:40,225
WE'LL MAKE IT ANOTHER TIME WHEN

634
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,093
THINGS ARE GOING EXTREMELY WELL.

635
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,762
AND THEY ARE GOING FOR THE

636
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:44,329
COUNTRY EXTREMELY WELL.

637
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,797
WE HAVE RECORD SETTING NUMBERS

638
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,265
IN EVERY WAY ECONOMICALLY.

639
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,101
BUT WE WANT TO SOLVE THIS

640
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,270
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM WHICH IS

641
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,671
GOING ON FOR 40 YEARS, MORE.

642
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:53,905
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOREVER.

643
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:57,476
AND WE WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN

644
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:57,743
SOLVE IT.

645
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,345
SO WE ARE CANCELLING OR

646
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,079
POSTPONING THE CONGRESSIONAL

647
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,446
PICNIC TOMORROW.

648
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,648
WOULD ANYBODY IN THE ROOM HAVE

649
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,782
ANY QUESTION OR STATEMENT THAT

650
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:08,519
YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE WHILE THE

651
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,056
PRESS IS HERE.

652
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:11,289
ANYBODY?

653
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,392
>> MR. PRESIDENT, ON THE ISSUE

654
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,293
OF IMMIGRATION, TRADE, AND

655
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,694
INVESTMENT, THESE ARE ALL AREAS

656
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,662
WHERE CONGRESS HAS A LOT OF

657
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:20,332
AUTHORITY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION

658
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,500
AND YOU HAVE AUTHORITY, THE

659
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,801
EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS AUTHORITY

660
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,368
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.

661
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,704
I THINK THAT'S WHY MEETINGS LIKE

662
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,005
THIS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

663
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,640
GETTING THE LEADERSHIP ON BOTH

664
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,075
SIDES TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY'RE

665
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,943
IMPORTANT ISSUES SO APPRECIATE

666
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,512
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET YOU SEE

667
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,415
OUR VIEWS AND HEAR OUR VIEWS ON

668
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,417
THESE ISSUES WHERE WE SHARE

669
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,318
AUTHORITY ON SOME IMPORTANT

670
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:39,618
MATTERS.

671
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,354
>> AND WE ALL VERY MUCH HAVE THE

672
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:42,721
SAME VIEWS.

673
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,255
WE WANT TO KEEP FAMILIES

674
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,222
TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME WE

675
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,957
HAVE TO BE STRONG ON THE BORDER.

676
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,259
OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE MILLIONS

677
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,227
OF PEOPLE COMING UP, NOT

678
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,461
THOUSANDS LIKE WE HAVE NOW,

679
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,695
YOU'LL HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

680
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,631
FLOWING UP AND JUST OVERTAKING

681
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,164
THE COUNTRY.

682
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,366
WE'RE NOT LETTING THAT HAPPEN.

683
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,435
SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY STRONG ON

684
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:56,801
THE BORDER.

685
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:02,107
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO

686
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:02,841
BE VERY COMPASSIONATE.

687
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,309
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANKS FOR

688
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,010
HAVING US.

689
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,045
I THINK WHAT DAN SAID WAS GOOD.

690
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,315
WE REALLY ON THE ISSUES ON

691
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,084
TRADE, IMMIGRATION, WE HAVE A

692
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:12,584
PARTNERSHIP UNDER THE

693
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:12,918
CONSTITUTION.

694
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,719
WE HAVE SOME AUTHORITY, THE

695
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,153
PRESIDENT HAS SOME AUTHORITY, WE

696
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:15,853
NEED TO WORK TOGETHER.

697
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:19,324
I WAS THINKING THIS MORNING WHEN

698
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:19,992
WE LOOK AT PRESIDENT NIXON'S

699
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,994
PORTRAIT IN THE WHITE HOUSE WE

700
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,895
THINK THAT HE DID THE UNEXPECTED

701
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:24,896
AND HE WENT TO CHINA BECAUSE HE

702
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,732
COULD DO THAT HE WAS IN A

703
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,800
POSITION TO DO THAT AND

704
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,135
PRESIDENT REAGAN DID THE

705
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,104
UNEXPECTED HE WENT TO THE BERLIN

706
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,239
WALL IN MOSCOW.

707
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,608
I THINK I SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT

708
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,709
IMMIGRATION WHICH HAS BEDEVILLED

709
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,779
US FOR 40 YEARS AS YOU HAVE SAID

710
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,915
I BELIEVE YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT

711
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:46,118
WHO CAN HELP US SOLVE THE

712
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:46,885
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM WITH YOUR

713
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:47,419
LEADERSHIP.

714
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,588
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO FOR

715
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,056
IMMIGRATION WHAT NIXON DID FOR

716
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,124
CHINA AND REAGAN DID FOR THE

717
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,592
SOVIET UNION AND A LOT OF US

718
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,728
WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON

719
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,796
THAT.

720
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,197
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

721
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,233
WE NEED THE DEMOCRATS SUPPORT

722
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,834
BECAUSE WE NEED THEIR VOTES.

723
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:03,435
VERY SIMPLE.

724
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,404
PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE A MAJORITY.

725
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:09,708
WELL WE HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE

726
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:09,941
SENATE.

727
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:12,844
WE NEED 60 UNFORTUNATELY WE

728
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,845
DON'T GO WITH THE MAJORITY,

729
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:14,445
SOMEDAY SOMEBODY WILL EXPLAIN

730
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:17,482
WHY BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

731
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:17,883
WE NEED 60 VOTES.

732
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,219
WE HAVE 51 VOTES AT THE MOST.

733
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,653
SO WE NEED DEMOCRAT VOTES IN

734
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,822
ORDER TO DO IT OTHERWISE YOU

735
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,957
CAN'T DO IT.

736
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:25,724
TOM, YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?

737
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,326
>> I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

738
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:28,927
WE PROTECT OUR BORDER.

739
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,096
WE CANNOT ALLOW A CHILD TO BE A

740
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,964
GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AND A

741
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:34,699
GET INTO THE U.S. FREE TICKET.

742
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:35,366
BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU HAVE

743
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:38,403
SAID AND WE HAVE ALL SAID WE

744
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,405
WOULD LIKE TO KEEP FAMILIES

745
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,942
TOGETHER FOR THE ORDERLY AND

746
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,409
TIMING PROCESSING OF THE ADULT'S

747
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:45,977
CLAIM.

748
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:46,744
IF IT'S LAWFUL AND LEGIT MAT WE

749
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:47,979
CAN ADMIT THEM TO THE COUNTRY.

750
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,781
IF NOT THEY'LL HAVE TO GO BACK

751
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,715
TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY.

752
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,250
I KNOW WE IN CONGRESS ARE

753
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,852
WORKING ON LEGISLATION THAT WILL

754
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,986
ALLOW OUR HARD WORKING BORDER

755
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:59,057
PATROL AGENTS TO KEEP FAMILIES

756
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,492
TOGETHER AT THE BORDER WHILE WE

757
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:00,959
PROCESS THEIR CLAIM.

758
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,195
>> YOU BROUGHT UP SOMETHING I

759
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,197
HAVE TO SAY, BORDER PATROL

760
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,932
AGENTS AND OUR I.C.E.

761
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,432
AGENTS

762
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,302
HAVE DONE ONE GREAT JOB.

763
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,105
WE'RE THROWING BY THE THOUSANDS,

764
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,472
MS13 THEY COME INTO THE COUNTRY.

765
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,307
WE'RE LIBERATING TOWNS ON LONG

766
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:16,874
ISLAND AND OTHER PLACES.

767
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:19,111
WE'RE THROWING THEM OUT BY THE

768
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:19,378
THOUSANDS.

769
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,013
BUT WE NEED LAWS THAT DON'T

770
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,983
ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK IN.

771
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,651
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THERE ARE A

772
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:27,919
NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE'RE

773
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,555
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS

774
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,759
TODAY THAT TOUCH ON COUNTRY'S

775
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,192
NATIONAL SECURITY.

776
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,461
AND CERTAINLY CONTROLLING WHO

777
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,697
AND WHAT COMES ACROSS OUR BORDER

778
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,331
IS AN ELEMENT OF NATIONAL

779
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:40,632
SECURITY.

780
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,136
AS WE DO THE COMPASSIONATE THING

781
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,803
WITH FAMILIES.

782
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,005
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

783
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,974
WITH YOU TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN

784
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,107
OUR MILITARY.

785
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:51,943
TOGETHER WE HAVE TURNED AROUND A

786
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:52,443
DECLINING SITUATION.

787
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,546
BUT THAT'S ALSO PART OF WHAT WE

788
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,982
NEED TO DO TOGETHER BACK TO

789
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,917
LAMAR'S POINT ABOUT WE BOTH HAVE

790
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,452
RESPONSIBILITIES WE CAN DO MORE

791
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,953
TOGETHER.

792
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,322
>> I WILL SAY WITH ALL OF THE

793
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,424
NUMBERS YOU SEE, IF WE WEREN'T

794
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,193
STRONG ON THE BORDER YOU WOULD

795
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,694
HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

796
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,029
PEOPLE POURING THROUGH THE

797
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,263
BORDER.

798
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:11,796
THEY WOULD JUST BE POURING

799
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:14,466
THROUGH AND THE COUNTRY WOULD

800
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,933
NOT BE THE COUNTRY ANYMORE.

801
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:18,003
>> WE HAVE A BIG MASSIVE MESS

802
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,337
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

803
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:19,570
DECADES.

804
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,206
AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO FIX IT

805
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:21,940
ONE DAY I HOPE.

806
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,809
BUT WE HAVE A SPECIFIC PROBLEM

807
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:29,147
THAT PUTS THE COUNTRY IN A

808
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:29,981
DILEMMA.

809
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,819
IF A FAMILY SHOWS UP AT THE

810
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,188
BORDER AND WE LET THE FAMILY GO

811
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,623
INTO THE COUNTRY AND SAY PLEASE

812
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,125
COME BACK FOR YOUR HEARING ABOUT

813
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,461
80% OF THE TIME THE ADULTS NEVER

814
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,595
SHOW UP FOR THE HEARING.

815
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:45,964
I THINK MOST AMERICANS FEEL LIKE

816
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,568
THAT IS BAD, IT WILL CREATE A

817
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,668
THIRD WAVE OF ILLEGAL

818
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:50,968
IMMIGRATION.

819
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:54,573
I WANT TO BE FAIR TO THE PEOPLE

820
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,340
WHO CAME UNDER THE SYSTEM BUT I

821
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,576
DON'T WANT TO CREATE A THIRD

822
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:57,776
WAVE.

823
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,511
THE OTHER CHOICE IS IF YOU

824
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,446
DETAIN THE PARENT WHO IS BROKE

825
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,013
THE LAW UNDER THE FLORES

826
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,882
DECISION YOU HAVE TO BREAK THE

827
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:05,149
FAMILY UP.

828
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:06,284
SO THERE'S A 1997 SPRING COURT

829
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,253
CASE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

830
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,221
SO I WOULD URGE MY DEMOCRATIC

831
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,823
FRIENDS TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND A

832
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,992
WAY TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER,

833
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,327
HAVE A LEGISLATIVE FIX OF THE

834
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,128
FLORES DECISION AND ARGUE ABOUT

835
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:17,628
THE OTHER THINGS LATER.

836
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:18,864
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, MR. PRESIDENT

837
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:23,402
YOU'RE IN A REAL BIND, IF YOU

838
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,236
DETAIN THE ADULTS THE LAW

839
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,737
REQUIRES THE CHILDREN TO BE

840
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,004
SEPARATED.

841
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,672
IF YOU LET THE ADULTS INTO THE

842
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,439
COUNTRY THEY NEVER SHOW UP.

843
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,175
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WANT TO KEEP

844
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,476
THE FAMILY TOGETHER AND HAVE THE

845
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,880
PARENTS SHOW UP FOR THEIR DAY IN

846
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,280
COURT.

847
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,615
TO SENATOR SCHUMER, I KNOW

848
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,284
THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T AGREE ON

849
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,852
BUT SURELY TO GOODNESS WE CAN

850
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,120
FIX THIS COURT DECISION BECAUSE

851
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,492
THE COUNTRY IS NOT IN A BAD SPOT

852
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:47,993
NOT JUST YOU.

853
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,328
>> LINDSEY, THE DILEMMA IS THAT

854
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,930
IF YOU'RE WEAK, WHICH SOME

855
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,666
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE, IF

856
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,500
YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY

857
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,601
PATHETICALLY WEAK THE COUNTRY IS

858
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,571
GOING TO BE OVERRUN WITH

859
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,038
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

860
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,274
AND IF YOU'RE STRONG THEN YOU

861
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,309
DON'T HAVE ANY HEART.

862
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,411
THAT'S A TOUGH DILEMMA.

863
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,880
PERHAPS I'D RATHER BE STRONG BUT

864
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,915
THAT'S A TOUGH DILEMMA.

865
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:11,816
>> MR. PRESIDENT?

866
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:12,217
>> YES.

867
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,218
>> IN OUR COMMITTEE HOMELAND

868
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:17,322
SECURITY WE HAVE HELD 30

869
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,022
HEARINGS ON BORDER SECURITY.

870
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:20,258
AND SENATOR GRAHAM MENTIONED THE

871
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,895
FACT THAT WE HAVE THESE

872
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:24,195
INCENTIVES.

873
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:25,329
THERE'S NOTHING ENTICING PEOPLE

874
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:32,003
TO TAKE A DANGEROUS JOURNEY.

875
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,437
THERE'S NOTHING COMPASSIONATE

876
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:34,773
ABOUT THAT.

877
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,176
BUT HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE

878
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:38,409
2012.

879
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:41,846
JST TALKING ABOUT UNACCOMPANIED

880
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:42,113
CHILDREN.

881
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:46,585
PRIOR TO THAT SOME 2 OR 3,000

882
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,652
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN CAME

883
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,252
THROUGH CENTRAL AMERICA THEN

884
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:53,925
DACA WAS INSTITUTE AND HAD THAT

885
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:54,525
PROBLEM SKYROCKETING.

886
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:55,760
THE NUMBERS ABOUT 225,000

887
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,128
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN JUST FROM

888
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:57,795
SOUTH AMERICA.

889
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:01,633
ABOUT HALF A MILLION FAMILY

890
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,000
MEMBERS.

891
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,869
SO WE HAVE ANOTHER 750,000

892
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,204
INDIVIDUALS, VERY SYMPATHETIC

893
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,772
THAT WE'RE JUST INCENTIVIZING TO

894
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:08,206
COME IN.

895
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,941
WE HAVE TO STOP THOSE

896
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:10,241
INCENTIVES.

897
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,143
THE GOAL OF OUR POLICY SHOULD BE

898
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,480
TO REDUCE THE FLOW OF PEOPLE

899
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,449
INCENTIVIZED TO COME TO THIS

900
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:17,682
COUNTRY.

901
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,382
AND THAT'S WHAT STRONG

902
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:18,783
ENFORCEMENT DOES.

903
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:22,253
>> JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS

904
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:24,489
DEAL WAS JUST ABOUT DONE.

905
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,957
WE HAD A DEAL SIGNED.

906
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:26,658
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED DACA.

907
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,026
WHAT HE SIGNED HE SAID I'M

908
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,127
REALLY NOT ALLOWED TO SIGN THIS

909
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,396
AND I'M GOING TO SIGN IT ANYWAY.

910
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:34,065
BUT HE ACTUALLY SAID I'M NOT

911
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,268
ALLOWED TO SIGN THIS, IT'S NEVER

912
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:38,135
GOING TO HOLD UP.

913
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,171
AND THEY GOT A JUDGE WHO HELD IT

914
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,374
UP, THEN ANOTHER ONE HELD IT UP,

915
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,875
THEN A COUPLE OF WHO TURNED IT

916
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,144
DOWN AND IT WILL BE A SUPREME

917
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:46,477
COURT ISSUE.

918
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:47,645
BUT BEFORE IT WAS HELD UP

919
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:48,446
EVERYONE ASSUMED THE DACA WOULD

920
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,249
NOT BE HELD UP AND WE HAD A DEAL

921
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:51,916
WITH THE DEMOCRATS.

922
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,551
IT WAS A DEAL THAT EVERYBODY

923
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:53,818
AGREED TO.

924
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,053
IT WAS $25 MILLION WE'RE GOING

925
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,355
TO BUILD A WALL, WE WOULD TAKE

926
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,791
CARE OF MANY, MANY DIFFERENT

927
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,358
THINGS INCLUDING LOOPHOLES.

928
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,093
IT WAS ALL DONE EXCEPT WHEN THIS

929
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,262
JUDGE RULED IN FAVOR OF DACA

930
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,596
MEANING THAT IT COULD CONTINUE

931
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:08,033
UNTIL WE GET TO THE SUPREME

932
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,235
COURT ALL O A SUDDEN THEY

933
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:10,735
WEREN'T THERE ANYMORE.

934
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,769
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

935
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,471
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THIS

936
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,140
MESS BECAUSE WE HAD A COUPLE OF

937
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,474
COURT DECISIONS WHICH IS GOING

938
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,576
TO FORCE AN ISSUE TO THE SUPREME

939
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:22,080
COURT THAT SHOULDN'T BE FORCED

940
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
TO THE SUPREME COURT.

941
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,151
>> THANKS FOR INVITING US UP ON

942
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,153
THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND FOR

943
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:28,853
HAVING THIS IMPORTANT

944
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:29,620
DISCUSSION.

945
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,122
CERTAINLY ON IMMIGRATION BUT

946
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:31,623
ALSO ON TRADE.

947
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,358
AND THE CONTEXT THAT I WANT TO

948
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:38,229
MAKE SURE WE TALK ABOUT IS WE

949
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,298
HAVE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS ON

950
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,833
TAX RELIEF AND REGULATORY

951
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,066
RELIEF.

952
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,034
AND IT'S REFLECTED IN OUR

953
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:43,267
ECONOMY.

954
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,470
NOW WE CAN DO THE SAME THING ON

955
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:45,670
TRADE.

956
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,938
THINK WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR

957
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,440
COUNTRY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC

958
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,876
GROWTH, IN TERMS OF JOBS, IN

959
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,177
TERMS OF GETTING WAGES MOVING

960
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:53,444
HIGHER.

961
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:54,546
AND THE IMPACT THAT HAS FOR ALL

962
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:54,813
AMERICANS.

963
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,415
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN THAT

964
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:57,782
CONTEXT.

965
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,186
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRADE, IT'S

966
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,020
ON TOP OF TAX RELIEF, REGULATORY

967
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,623
RELIEF, AND NOW IF WE CAN GET

968
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,058
THE RIGHT POLICIES IN PLACE ON

969
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,893
TRADE THINK WHAT THAT MEANS FOR

970
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:09,226
OUR COUNTRY.

971
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:11,863
>> WE'RE DOING VERY WELL ON

972
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:12,630
TRADE I WILL SAY.

973
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,367
WE HAVE BEEN REALLY HURT AS A

974
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:19,604
COUNTRY ON TRADE FOR MANY YEARS.

975
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,305
DESPITE BAD TRADE DEALS WE'RE

976
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:21,906
REALLY WELL.

977
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,075
NOW WE'RE MAKING REALLY GOOD

978
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:24,508
TRADE DEALS.

979
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:25,243
THEY'LL BE ANNOUNCED PRETTY

980
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:25,476
RAPIDLY.

981
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:27,311
WE ALREADY HAVE A COUPLE THAT

982
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:29,214
ARE MADE.

983
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,148
BUT WE'RE MAKING GREAT TRADE

984
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:30,348
DEALS.

985
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,483
AND HONESTLY WE NEED PEOPLE

986
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,483
COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.

987
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:35,720
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPANIES

988
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,221
COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.

989
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:37,822
CHRYSLER JUST ANNOUNCED.

990
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,592
WE HAVE FOX CON IS GOING UP TO

991
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,459
WISCONSIN AS YOU KNOW.

992
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,362
AND THEY'RE A GREAT COMPANY THEY

993
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,365
MAKE THE APPLE iPHONES AND

994
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,933
LAPTOPS AND AN UNBELIEVABLE

995
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:49,701
COMPANY.

996
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:50,101
WE NEED PEOPLE.

997
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,302
WE NEED PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR

998
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,837
THESE COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY'RE

999
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,973
COMING IN AT A NUMBER NOBODY

1000
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:55,473
EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

1001
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,242
SO WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO

1002
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,075
OUR COUNTRY.

1003
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,678
BUT I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR

1004
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,845
EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE WE WANT

1005
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,015
THEM TO COME IN BASED ON MERIT.

1006
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,517
WE WANT GREAT PEOPLE THAT WILL

1007
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,551
BE GREAT FOR OUR COUNTRY.

1008
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,720
AND WE WANT THEM TO COME IN

1009
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,353
BASED ON MERIT.

1010
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:10,622
WE'RE GOING TO NEED THOSE PEOPLE

1011
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,190
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY

1012
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,525
COMPANIES COMING TO THE COUNTRY.

1013
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:15,960
>> MR. PRESIDENT, TO YOUR POINT,

1014
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,828
AMERICA IS THE MOST GENEROS

1015
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,730
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHEN IT

1016
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,730
COMES TO LEGAL IMMIGRATION.

1017
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,101
I THINK WE OUGHT TO DRAW A VERY

1018
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,469
CLEAR LINE BETWEEN LEGAL

1019
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,403
IMMIGRATION THAT BENEFITS OUR

1020
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,404
COUNTRY AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

1021
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:27,839
WHICH IS A THREAT TO PUBLIC

1022
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,072
SAFETY.

1023
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:31,276
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE ONE

1024
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:31,476
POINT.

1025
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,278
I AGREE WITH WHAT TOM COTTON AND

1026
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,379
OTHERS HAVE SAID, WHAT YOU SAID

1027
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,182
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ENFORCE THE

1028
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,449
LAW AND KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER.

1029
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:39,651
IT'S NOT A MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

1030
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:39,918
CHOICE.

1031
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,085
WE CAN DO BOTH.

1032
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:43,221
AND I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL

1033
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:43,654
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.

1034
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:46,057
BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

1035
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,295
THAT COMING FROM A BORDER STATE

1036
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,898
LIKE MAC AND I DO THE ILLEGALITY

1037
00:28:53,898 --> 00:29:00,638
ALONG THE BORDER IS A COMPLEX

1038
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:01,105
PROBLEM.

1039
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,540
AS SOMEBODY POINTED OUT IT'S

1040
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,908
COMMODITY AGNOSTIC, IT'S PEOPLE,

1041
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,610
IT'S DRUGS, IT'S WEAPONS.

1042
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,846
AND YOU TALK ABOUT AN OPIOID

1043
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,948
PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES

1044
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,017
IT'S NOT JUST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

1045
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,352
IT'S OPIOID THAT DPROMS MEXICO.

1046
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,622
WE NEED LAW AND ORDER ALONG THE

1047
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:17,855
BORDER.

1048
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,457
EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT, WE

1049
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,326
NEED TO BE COMPASSIONATE THE WAY

1050
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,493
WE HANDLE THESE FAMILIES.

1051
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,529
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

1052
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,897
THAT LARGER CONTEXT BECAUSE THE

1053
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:26,531
CARTELS AND CRIMINAL

1054
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,598
ORGANIZATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM

1055
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:28,366
THIS.

1056
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,901
THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY

1057
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,670
AND KEEPING THIS SITUATION IS

1058
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,872
VERY DANGEROUS FOR EVERYBODY

1059
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:35,139
INVOLVED.

1060
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,841
>> IN ALL WAYS THEY'RE USING THE

1061
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,843
CHILDREN AS A TICKET TO GET INTO

1062
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:40,010
THE COUNTRY.

1063
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,180
AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.

1064
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,550
THERE'S A NUMBER OF THE 12,000

1065
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,353
CHILDREN, 2,000 WITH THE PARENTS

1066
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,288
AND 10,000 CAME UP WITH SOME

1067
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,223
REALLY HORRIBLE PEOPLE IN SOME

1068
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,358
CASES.

1069
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,661
YOU HAVE THE COYOTES, YOU HAVE

1070
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,996
THE TRAFFICKERS, THE HUMAN

1071
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:58,830
TRAFFICKERS.

1072
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,632
NOT ONLY DRUG TRAFFICKERS BUT

1073
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,332
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS.

1074
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,901
AND THEY USE THESE CHILDREN AS

1075
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:03,768
PASSPORTS TO GET INTO THE

1076
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,001
COUNTRY.

1077
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:06,070
SO WE HAVE TO WORK ON THAT TOO.

1078
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,872
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE.

1079
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,340
IT HAS BEEN GOING ON, YOU

1080
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,743
SHOULDN'T FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE

1081
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,912
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY,

1082
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:14,812
MANY YEARS, MANY, MANY DECADES.

1083
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:16,414
BUT WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THAT

1084
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,216
ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER

1085
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,784
PROBLEMS WE HAVE ALREADY SOLVED.

1086
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,385
WE'RE DOING WELL AT SOLVING

1087
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:21,652
PROBLEMS.

1088
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,422
WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT WE HAD

1089
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:24,755
NORTH KOREA.

1090
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:26,791
WE HAD THE IRAN DEAL WHICH WAS

1091
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,158
NO GOOD.

1092
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,160
WE HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS WITH

1093
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,029
TRADE AND BAD TRADE DEALS.

1094
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,965
AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE

1095
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,768
SOLVING THAT IN THEORY I

1096
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,435
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO SOLVE.

1097
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,670
THESE ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD

1098
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,172
HAVE BEEN SOLVEDOR A LONG TIME

1099
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:41,539
EVEN ON TRADE.

1100
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,241
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER ALLOWED OUR

1101
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,442
PAST LEADERS, SHOULD HAVE NEVER

1102
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:49,480
ALLOWED CHINA TO GET TO A POINT

1103
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,148
WHERE THERE'S A $500 BILLION

1104
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,615
TRADE DEFICIT WITH THE UNITED

1105
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:51,849
STATES.

1106
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,419
WHEN THEY WENT UP WE SHOULD HAVE

1107
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,152
GONE UP.

1108
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:57,020
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE UP TOGETHER.

1109
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,489
AND THAT INCLUDES THE EUROPEAN

1110
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,356
UNION AND MANY OTHERS.

1111
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,357
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

1112
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,160
SO WE CAME AT A TIME WHERE THERE

1113
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,063
WERE PLENTY OF PROBLEMS TO

1114
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:05,263
SOLVE.

1115
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,333
AND ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IS

1116
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:08,633
IMMIGRATION.

1117
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,103
AND I HOPE WITHIN NOT TOO LONG

1118
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,872
DISTANCE AND I MEAN BEYOND THIS

1119
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,641
ONE PROBLEM OF IMMIGRATION YOU

1120
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,508
CAN MENTION THE WORD

1121
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,778
COMPREHENSIVE OR YOU DON'T HAVE

1122
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:21,612
TO USE IT.

1123
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:24,115
A LOT OF POLITICIANS DON'T LIKE

1124
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,449
THE WORD COMPREHENSIVE

1125
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:25,883
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

1126
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,352
BUT I THINK WE HAVE THE

1127
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,553
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE WHOLE

1128
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,920
IMMIGRATION PICTURE AND THAT'S

1129
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,189
WHAT I'M LOOKING TO DO

1130
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:31,489
ULTIMATELY.

1131
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,526
BUT RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO FIX

1132
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:35,859
THIS PROBLEM.

1133
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,462
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE LAST YEAR

1134
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,731
AND A HALF HAS SHOWN AN ABSOLUTE

1135
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,931
TURN AROUND IN THIS ECONOMY.

1136
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:45,169
I MEAN WE WERE FACED WITH EIGHT

1137
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,904
YEARS OF 1.9% ECONOMIC GROWTH.

1138
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,740
WE FOCUSSED ON AS JOHN SAID

1139
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,573
REGULATION AND TAXES.

1140
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:53,711
THIS YEAR WE PUT A DODD-FRANK

1141
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,946
BILL A BIPARTISAN BILL.

1142
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:55,980
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS FREED UP

1143
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,550
$6 TRILLION TO GO BACK INTO THE

1144
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,118
ECONOMY.

1145
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,720
THIS IS REAL JOBS.

1146
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,621
3.5 MILLION NEW JOBS.

1147
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:04,021
870 REGULATIONS.

1148
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:04,522
THIS ECONOMY IS MOVING.

1149
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,925
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS PAYING

1150
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:08,259
ATTENTION.

1151
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,093
NATO HAS DOUBLED THEIR

1152
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,829
INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF MILITARY

1153
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,096
SPENDING.

1154
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,865
WE HAVE A NEW FREE TRADE

1155
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:14,465
AGREEMENT WITH NORTH KOREA.

1156
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,201
I JUST HOPE WE CAN FOCUS ON THE

1157
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,269
PRIORITIES WITHIN THIS TRADE

1158
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,204
AGREEMENT TO GET EQUAL ACCESS.

1159
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:26,577
IT'S NO A RIGHT WHEN ALIBABA CAN

1160
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,579
DO CLOUD COMPUTING AND GOOGLE

1161
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,746
CAN'T DO IT IN CHINA.

1162
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,281
WE HAVE REDUCED BY 2/3 IN THE

1163
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:32,950
LAST 30 YEARS WHILE POVERTY IN

1164
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,619
THE UNITED STATES HAS REMAINED

1165
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:34,819
FLAT.

1166
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,820
THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND THIS IS

1167
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,822
MOVING TO CHANGE THAT.

1168
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,258
>> I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

1169
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,693
YOU CALL ATTENTION TO WHAT'S

1170
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:44,962
REALLY HAPPENING NOW WITH THE

1171
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:49,033
ECONOMY DUE TO TWO THINGS.

1172
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,668
THE TAX BILL AND THE

1173
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,636
REGULATIONS.

1174
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,571
YOU KNOW WE WERE KILLING PEOPLE

1175
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,038
WITH THE REGULATIONS.

1176
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,406
BUT WHAT HASN'T BEEN SAID AROUND

1177
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:56,774
THIS TABLE AND I'M SURPRISED THE

1178
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,474
BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENT FROM YOUR

1179
00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:01,345
ADMINISTRATION IS WHAT YOU HAVE

1180
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:02,479
DONE WITH THE MILITARY.

1181
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:06,851
YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED A POLICY THAT

1182
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,287
SAID YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING IN

1183
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,588
SECRET WITH THE MILITARY UNLESS

1184
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,923
YOU DO IT WITH THE DEFENSE.

1185
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:14,892
WE HAD TO VOTE FOR A LOUSY

1186
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,762
BUDGET BILL TO DO IT BUT

1187
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,663
NONETHELESS IT IS CHANGED.

1188
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:22,300
WE'RE NOW REBUILDING OUR

1189
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,367
MILITARY.

1190
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,002
>> THE MILITARY IS REALLY

1191
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:25,335
INCREDIBLE.

1192
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:26,971
WE'RE ORDERING NEW PLANES, NEW

1193
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,239
SHIPS, ALL JOBS TOO.

1194
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,475
JOBS I WOULD SAY IN THIS CASE IS

1195
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,776
A FAR SECOND BUT WE'RE GOING TO

1196
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,511
HAVE A MILITARY LIKE WE HAVE

1197
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,848
NEVER HAD BEFORE AND IT'S GREAT.

1198
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:38,315
700 BILLION APPROVED.

1199
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,952
AND IN THAT BUDGET 6 BILLION FOR

1200
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:41,185
OPIOID.

1201
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,320
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TOO.

1202
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,457
SO A LOT OF PROGRESS IS BEING

1203
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:46,791
MADE.

1204
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,658
MIKE,DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO

1205
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:47,892

1206
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:48,593
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

1209
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,732
THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR THE

1210
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:55,867
SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

1211
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,868
SENATE AND THE HOUSE THAT ARE

1212
00:33:57,868 --> 00:33:58,736
GATHERED AROUND HERE.

00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,907
SECURITY, REBUILDING OUR

1216
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,209
MILITARY, ON TAX CUTS AND

1217
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,044
REGULATORY REFORM, RESTORING OUR

1218
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:07,378
ECONOMY.

1219
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,478
WHAT THE PRESIDENT REITERATED

1220
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,648
AGAIN YESTERDAY AND HE HAS SAID

1221
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,350
EVERYDAY FROM WHEN HE SOUGHT

1222
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,918
THIS OFFICE IS WE HAVE A CRISIS

1223
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:15,853
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

1224
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,989
AND AS THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR

1225
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,224
WE DON'T WANT FAMILIES TO BE

1226
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:20,491
SEPARATED.

1227
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,027
WE DON'T WANT CHILDREN TAKEN

1228
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,460
AWAY FROM PARENTS.

1229
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,165
BUT RIGHT NOW UNDER THE LAW AND

1230
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,467
WE SIT WITH THESE LAWMAKERS WE

1231
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,400
ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES BEFORE US.

1232
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,003
NUMBER ONE IS DON'T PROSECUTE

1233
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,005
PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY

1234
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,572
ILLEGALLY, OR PROSECUTE THEM AND

1235
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:36,440
THEN UNDER COURT CASES AND THE

1236
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,643
LAW THEY HAVE TO BE SEPARATED

1237
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:40,077
FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

1238
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,012
WHAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT IS

1239
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:46,583
WE'RE CALLING ON THESE

1240
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:47,150

1242
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,755
WAY THAT CONFIRMS OUR COMMITMENT

1243
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,856
TO LAW AND ORDER AND COMPASSION

1244
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,324
WHICH WE CAN DO AND THERE ARE

1245
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,293
PROPOSALS IN THE SENATE AND

1246
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,893
HOUSE TO DO THAT.

1247
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:57,895
BUT THE PRESIDENT'S VISION

1248
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,864

LEGISLATION TOMORROW, THE SENATE

IS CONSIDERING LEGISLATION, AND

1265
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,958
THE PRESIDENT HAS POSTPONED THE

1266
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,825
CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC.

1267
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,627
WE'RE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO

IMMIGRATION.

1273
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,770
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1274
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,438

00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,673
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU.

1276
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:48,212
AND JUST FROM THE HOUSE

1277
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,515
PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO SAY THERE

1278
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:52,950
IS BEEN A MARKED DIFFERENCE

1279
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,086
BETWEEN THE SECURITY AND THE

1280
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,153
GOOD FEELINGS IN THE MILITARY.

1281
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,021
THEY UNDERSTAND WE'RE INVESTING

1282
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,022
IN THEM AGAIN EVEN THOUGH WE'RE

1283
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,590
ASKING THEM TO DO A LOT.

1284
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,826
AND SECONDLY SECURITY PLAYS A

1285
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,226
BIG ROLE.

1286
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,527
AND THAT INCLUDES BORDER

1287
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:04,028
SECURITY.

1288
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,029
AND THE BILL WE'LL BRING UP AND

1289
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,497
PASS IN THE HOUSE THIS WEEK

1290
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,432
FULLY FUNDS THE BORDER AND TAKES

1291
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,935
CARE OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES.

1292
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,904
I WISH DEMOCRATS WOULD JOIN US

1293
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,939
BECAUSE FRANKLY IT'S A LOT OF

1294
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:15,539
STUFF THEY LIKE TOO.

1295
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,674
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THEY LIKE

1296
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,909
THE POLITICS OF THIS A LITTLE

1297
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:19,277
BETTER.

1298
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,178
AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY WE REALLY

1299
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:26,884
WISH YOU DIDN'T TAKE SECRETARY

1300
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,386
POMPEO FROM THE HOUSE BUT HE'S

1301
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,287
DOING A GREAT JOB.

1302
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:31,489
>> HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.

1303
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:36,660
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

1304
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,629
I WANT TO ECHO PARTICULARLY IN

1305
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,631
THE TERMS OF CHANGE WE HAVE SEEN

1306
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,099
IN TERMS OF RESOURCES FOR THE

1307
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:42,366
MILITARY.

1308
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,935
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T

1309
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,337

WE'RE ALSO GOING TO COUNT ON

1335
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:31,948
CONGRESS OBVIOUSLY.

1336
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:33,150
BUT WE ARE SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE

1337
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,585

WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FAMILIES

1339
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:38,288

PEOPLE, BY CRIME, BY ALL OF THE

1343
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,962
THINGS THAT WE DON'T STAND FOR

1344
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:45,996
THAT WE DON'T WANT.

WHILE BEFORE I GO TO MINNESOTA.

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,904
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE'RE KEEPING

1350
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,574
FAMILIES TOGETHER BUT WE HAVE TO

1351
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,609
KEEP OUR BORDERS STRONG.

1352
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,578
WE WILL BE OVERRUN WITH CRIME

1353
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:05,850
AND WITH PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NOT

1354
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,017
BE IN OUR COUNTRY.

1355
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:09,620
>> WILL YOU HAVE A STAND ALONE

1356
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,354

1357
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,689
SEPARATION ISSUE?

1358
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,424
>> WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT

1359
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:13,657
HAPPENS.

1360
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:17,261
>> DID THE IMAGES OF THE YOUNG

1361
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,495
CHILDREN AT THE BORDER --

1362
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:19,530
>> THOSE IMAGES EFFECT

1363
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:19,797
EVERYBODY.

1364
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,533
BUT I HAVE TO SAY YOU HAVE

1365
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:22,933
DOUBLE STANDARDS.

1366
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:23,801
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT

1367
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,036
ABSOLUTE SECURITY AND SAFETY AND

1368
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,704
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT DO LOOK AT

1369
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,005
THE CHILDREN AND THEN YOU HAVE

1370
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,440
PEOPLE LIKE ME AND I THINK MOST

1371
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,811
OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT

1372
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,077
WANT BOTH.

1373
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,813
WE WANT STRONG BORDERS AND WE

1374
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,213
WANT NO CRIME.

1375
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,449
WE DON'T WANT CRIME IN THIS

1376
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:38,949
COUNTRY.

1377
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,350
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN.

1378
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,185
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN

1379
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,787
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST THROUGH OUR

1380
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,356
BORDER USING CHILDREN TO GET

1381
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:45,823
THROUGH THE LINES.

1382
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,256
WE DON'T WANT THAT.

1383
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:47,858
WE DID TOO GOOD A JOB TO ALLOW

1384
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:48,358
THAT TO HAPPEN.

1385
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:55,165
SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT

1386
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,633
TO HAPPEN.

1387
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:59,003
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1388
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,505
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR

1389
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,439
50 YEARS, LONGER.

1390
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:04,542
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON UNDER

1391
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,275
PRESIDENT OBAMA, UNDER PRESIDENT

1392
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:05,943
BUSH.

1393
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,711
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY,

1394
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:08,011
MANY YEARS.

1395
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,813
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN

1396
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:10,080
SOLVE IT.

1397
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,782
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

1398
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:12,950
HAPPENED JUST NOW.

1399
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,419
YOU LOOK AT THE IMAGES

1400
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,687
FROM 2014.

1401
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,954
I WAS WATCHING THIS MORNING.

1402
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:19,690
AND THEY WERE SHOWING IMAGES

1403
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,024
FROM 2014.

1404
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,959
THEY BLOW AWAY WHAT WE'RE

1405
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,759
LOOKING AT TODAY.

1406
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,195
AND THAT WAS NOT DURING THIS,

1407
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,863
THAT WAS DURING THE OBAMA

1408
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,230
ADMINISTRATION.

1409
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,932
I SAW IMAGES THAT WERE HORRIBLE.

1410
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,500
AND YOU KNOW THE ONES I'M

1411
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,901
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I'M SURE

1412
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:31,801
YOU ALL SAW THEM TOO.

1413
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,737
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IF WE CAN

1414
00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:34,772
SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM.

1415
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,774
LIKE WE HAVE SOLVED SO MANY

1416
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:41,145
OTHER PROBLEMS AND I THINK WE'LL

1417
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:41,845
GET IT DONE.

1418
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:46,884
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1419
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,318
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

1420
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:48,451
.

1421
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:49,854
>> THERE YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT

1422
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,856
SAYING THAT HE WILL BE SIGNING

1423
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,123
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WILL

1424
00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:55,426
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SECURITY AT

1425
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,362
THE BORDER AS WELL AS THE

1426
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,563
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES AT THE

1427
00:39:59,563 --> 00:39:59,897
BORDER.

1428
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,366
I WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO MAJOR

1429
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,067
GARRET AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1430
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:05,402
MAJOR, FOR DAYS NOW THE

1431
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:06,437
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYING IT'S

1432
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,439
UP TO THE DEMOCRATS TO DO

1433
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:11,108
SOMETHING IF YOU WANT TO STOP

1434
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,109
THE SEPARATION AT THE BORDER.

1435
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,443
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT BECAUSE

1436
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:15,379
HE'S ABOUT TO SIGN AN EXECUTIVE

1437
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:15,746
ORDER.

1438
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,279
WHAT DO WE MAKE OF THIS.

1439
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,781
>> THE WORD FROM THE ATTORNEY

1440
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:19,250
GENERAL THIS WEEK, FROM THE

1441
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,851
HOMELAND SECURITIES SECRETARY,

00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:23,453
WHO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE WHITE

1444
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:23,653
HOUSE.

1445
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,890
THE LAW IS THE LAW YOU HAVE TO

1446
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,259
ENFORCE THE LAW, WE HAVE NO

1447
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,359
CHOICE, OUR OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.

1448
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,093
NO THEY'RE NOT LIMITED ACTUALLY.

1449
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,495
YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO SOLVE THIS

1450
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:36,500
BECAUSE IN FACT, AND THIS IS AN

1451
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,868
UNDISPUTED FACT, THIS

1452
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,904
ADMINISTRATION DECIDED WITH ITS

1453
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,439
0 TOLERANCE POLICY TO PROSECUTE

1454
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,207
EVERYONE CROSSING THE BORDER.

1455
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:45,743
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A 1997

1456
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,677
SUPREME COURT DECISION IN THE

1457
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:49,013
FLORES CASE THAT REQUIRED

1458
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,314
PARENTS TO BE SEPARATED FROM

1459
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,751
THEIR CHILDREN OR ADULTS TO BE

1460
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,351
SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN

1461
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,186
ACCOMPANYING THEM WHETHER THEY

1462
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:58,055
WERE THEIR CHILDREN OR NOT.

1463
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,357
OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE FACED

1464
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,157
THIS SIMILAR DILEMMA.

1465
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:03,060
AND IN CERTAIN RESPECTS THE

1466
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,828
OBAMA AND BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS

1467
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:06,963
ON A LIMITED BASIS SEPARATED

1468
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:07,965
FAMILIES.

1469
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,500
BUT WHEN THIS ADMINISTRATION

1470
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,369
ASSERTED AND ENFORCED A 0

1471
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,337
TOLERANCE POLICY IT SET THIS

1472
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,905
SITUATION PLAYING OUT ON THE

1473
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,807
SOUTHERN BORDER RIGHT NOW IN

1474
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,107
MOTION.

1475
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:17,942
THAT HAS BECOME A POLITICAL

1476
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,044
CRISIS FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE

1477
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:20,977
HOUSE AND SENATE.

1478
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:22,580
IT HAS BECOME AN OPTICS CRISIS

1479
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,914
FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE FORCING THE

1480
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,449
PRESIDENT FOR THE VERY FIRST

1481
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,117
TIME IN HIS PRESIDENCY TO

1482
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,353
REVERSE HIMSELF ON AN ISSUE IN

1483
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,122
WHICH HE HAS BEEN BOTH

1484
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,325
ENTRENCHED AND RESOLUTE, BORDER

1485
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,059
SECURITY.

1486
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,727
IS IT A HUGE REVERSAL?

1487
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:36,894
NO.

1488
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,329
BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING BUT THAT

1489
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,462
EVEN IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND

1490
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:44,301
WITH THIS PRESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN

1491
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,001
SO AGGRESSIVE ON IMMIGRATION,

1492
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,169
EVEN THESE POLITICS WERE TOO

1493
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:48,238
MUCH FOR HIM TO BEAR WITHOUT

1494
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:49,139
CHANGING HIS APPROACH.

1495
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,509
AND THE CHANGED APPROACH IS BY

1496
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,045
HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER HE WILL KEEP

1497
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:55,445
FAMILIES TOGETHER.

1498
00:41:55,445 --> 00:42:02,019
AND THAT IS SOMETHING HE WILL DO

1499
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,487
TEMPORARILY AWAITING ACTION FROM

1500
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:03,754
CONGRESS.

1501
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:04,921
AND HE INDICATED AT THE VERY

1502
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:06,223
TAIL END OF THAT QUESTION AND

1503
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,258
ANSWER SESSION THAT HE MIGHT

1504
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,427
SIGN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

1505
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,962
ONLY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE.

1506
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,897
NOT ALL OF THE OTHER IMMIGRATION

1507
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:15,499
PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED BY THIS

1508
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:15,866
ADMINISTRATION.

1509
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,566
THAT'S WHAT TO WATCH.

1510
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:17,801
IF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS GET

1511
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,603
TOGETHER ON THIS FAMILY

1512
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,437
SEPARATION ISSUE AND PUT A

1513
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,206
SINGULAR NARROW PIECE OF

1514
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,273
LEGISLATION ON THE PRESIDENT'S

1515
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:25,409
DESK WILL HE SIGN IT, AND WILL

1516
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,944
HE SIGN IT KNOWING IN SO DOING

1517
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,014
HE WILL PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO

1518
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,115
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING ELSE ON

1519
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,950
IMMIGRATION THE REMAINDER OF

1520
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,651
THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR.

1521
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,318
THAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION OF THIS

1522
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:34,685
WHITE HOUSE.

1523
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:39,256
>> I WANT TO BRING IN PAULA REED

1524
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,857
OUR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT IN

1525
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:41,625
WASHINGTON, D.C.

1526
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,895
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM YOUR

1527
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,128
SOURCES?

1528
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:46,463
>> I'M TOLD SINCE ABOUT 7:00

1529
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,263
THIS MORNING JUSTICE OFFICIALS

1530
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:48,432
INCLUDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

1531
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,566
JEFF SESSIONS HAVE BEEN HUDDLED

1532
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:50,868
AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

1533
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,469
WORKING ON THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER.

1534
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,937
AND I'M TOLD THIS EXECUTIVE

1535
00:42:53,937 --> 00:42:56,240
ORDER WILL CERTAINLY NOT END THE

1536
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,941
POLICY OF 0 TOLERANCE.

1537
00:42:57,941 --> 00:43:00,511
THEY WILL STILL AIM TO PROSECUTE

1538
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:06,417
EVERYONE WHO CROSSES THE BORDER

1539
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:06,750
ILLEGALLY.

1540
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,452
BUT DURING THE PROCESS OF

1541
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,586
DEPORTATION AND PROSECUTION THIS

1542
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:14,858
WILL ALLOW FAMILIES TO BE HELD

1543
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:15,158
TOGETHER.

1544
00:43:15,158 --> 00:43:17,494
THEY ARE EXPECTING SOME LEGAL

1545
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,430
CHALLENGES TO THIS UNDER THE

1546
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,764
FLORES CASE.

1547
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,533
BUT THEY ARE CONFIDENT THE

1548
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,367
PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE POWER WILL

1549
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,401
PREVAIL ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE

1550
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,403
TALKING ABOUT THE WELFARE AND

1551
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,438
SAFETY OF CHILDREN AT THE

1552
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:27,671
BORDER.

1553
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,006
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

1554
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,775
ALL DAY AND EVEN THOUGH JEFF

1555
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,645
SESSIONS IMPLEMENTED THE 0

1556
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,579
TOLERANCE POLICY AND HAS BEEN

1557
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,780
THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE

1558
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,781
ADMINISTRATION IN HIS OWNERSHIP

1559
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,416
AND COMMITMENT TO THAT AND THE

1560
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,918
FACT THAT IT IS A DETERRENT HE

1561
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,920
WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF

1562
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,854
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER TODAY.

1563
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,255
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, WHEN YOU

1564
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,657
TALK ABOUT THE FLORES DECISION

1565
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:50,527
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

1566
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,829
ABOUT, BECAUSE THEY ARE

1567
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:52,729
ARRESTING PEOPLE AT THE BORDER

1568
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:56,400
THAT IS WHY THE CHILDREN HAVE

1569
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,267
BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR

1570
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:57,634
PARENTS.

1571
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:58,568
THE FLORES DECISION INDICATES

1572
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:02,005
YOU CAN'T HOLD CHILDREN FOR MORE

1573
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:02,405
THAN 20 DAYS.

1574
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:02,840
>> EXACTLY.

1575
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,274
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WILL BE

1576
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,043
DIFFICULT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

1577
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,177
TO GET AROUND?

1578
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:07,611
>> NOT NECESSARILY.

1579
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,213
BECAUSE YOU CAN HANDLE

1580
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:09,713
IMMIGRATION TWO WAYS.

1581
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,081
YOU CAN HANDLE IT AS A CIVIL

1582
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:14,118
MATTER OR PROSECUTE EVERYONE WHO

1583
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,752
COMES ACROSS THE BORDER

1584
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:16,019
ILLEGALLY.

1585
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,755
AND BEFORE THE 0 TOLERANCE

1586
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,522
POLICY THE DEPARTMENT OF

1587
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,890
HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE

1588
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,291
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAD

1589
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,459
DISCRETION IF THEY ENCOUNTERED

1590
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,560
SOMEONE THEY BELIEVED WAS PART

1591
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,928
OF SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL

1592
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:25,729
ORGANIZATION OR WAS A CRIMINAL

1593
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,498
THEY COULD OPT TO PROSECUTE THAT

1594
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,165
PERSON OR NOT.

1595
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,166
OR THEY COULD RELEASE THOSE

1596
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,101
PEOPLE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND

1597
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,404
GIVE THEM A COURT DATE WHICH

1598
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:35,806
STATISTICALLY MANY PEOPLE NEVER

1599
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:36,173
SHOWED UP FOR.

1600
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,608
SO HERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

1601
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,076
SAID WE'RE GOING TO PROSECUTE

1602
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:43,147
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO CROSSES

1603
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:43,747
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY.

1604
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:44,915
IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE SOMEONE

1605
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,684
YOU MUST DETAIN THEM AND BECAUSE

1606
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:47,851
D

1607
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,653
FOR CRIMES THAT IS PART OF WHY

1608
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,355
MANY FAMILIES HAD TO BE

1609
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,792
SEPARATED WHICH LED TO THIS

1610
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:54,992
CISIS.

1611
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,427
AN EXECUTIVE SEEMS TO BE THE

1612
00:44:57,427 --> 00:44:58,728
ONLY LEGAL AND POLITICALLY

1613
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:00,030
VIABLE SOLUTION TO THE SITUATION

1614
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,799
THAT THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES

1615
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:01,965
IN.

1616
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,233
OF COURSE THEY COULD REVERSE ON

1617
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,868
0 TOLERANCE BUT I AM TOLD THAT

1618
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,069
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS

1619
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:08,138
ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING TO DO THAT

1620
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,373
WHICH LEAVES THEM WITH AN

1621
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,042
EXECUTIVE ORDER WORK AROUND.

1622
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,844
WE'LL SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT OUT

1623
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,780
IN THE FIELD AND IN THE COURTS.

1624
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,651
>>> MAJOR GARRET IS STANDING BY

1625
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:20,851
STILL.

1626
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,319
>> SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

1627
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,855
IMPORTANT BASED ON WHAT PAULA

1628
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,024
JUST SAID AND WHAT THE

1629
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,225
PRESIDENTS REMARKS SAID

1630
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,626
THROUGHOUT THAT 25-MINUTE

1631
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:35,131
SESSION WITH HOUSE AND SENATE

1632
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:35,532
REPUBLICANS.

1633
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,733
REPEATEDLY HE REFERRED TO PEOPLE

1634
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:41,104
COMING ACROSS THE BORDER AS

1635
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:41,671
CRIMINALS AND SMUGGLERS.

1636
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:43,540
THIS LAW ASSUMES THAT BECAUSE

1637
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,808
YOU'RE CROSSING THE BORDER

1638
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,076
WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION YOU'RE

1639
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,644
PROBABLY A CRIMINAL NOT JUST

1640
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,546
SOMEONE TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT OR

1641
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:52,216
FOR SOME OTHER REASON THAT WAS

1642
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,850
VIEWED BY PREVIOUS

1643
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,885
ADMINISTRATIONS AS LARGELY

1644
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:55,252
BENIGN.

1645
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,721
SO IF EVERYONE IS A CRIMINAL

1646
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,090
THEN EVERYONE MUST BE

1647
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:00,390
PROSECUTED.

1648
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,058
AND THAT IS WHAT'S NEW.

1649
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:01,792
THE ASSUMPTION CARRIED OUT BY

1650
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,061
THE GOVERNMENT THAT IF YOU'RE

1651
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:04,962
OUT THE BORDER WITHOUT

1652
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,997
DOCUMENTATION YOU MUST BE A

1653
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,100
CRIMINAL OF SOME KIND, A DRUG

1654
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,269
SMUGGLER, A HUMAN TRAFFICKER,

1655
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:12,970
SOMETHING REALLY BAD.

1656
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:18,208
THE PRESIDENT'S LANGUAGE

1657
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:22,379
CONTINUES TO CONFLATE IS AND USE

1658
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,448
SYMBOLIC ADJECTIVES OF

1659
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:28,652
DESCRIBING THOSE COMING ACROSS

1660
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:32,022
THE BORDER AS CRIMINAL INTENT.

1661
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,223
THAT ASSUMPTION LIES BEHIND THIS

1662
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,491
NEW 0 TOLERANCE POLICY.

1663
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,461
YOU CAN CHANGE THAT ASSUMPTION.

1664
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,929
YOU CAN USE THE ASSUMPTION

1665
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:39,563
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS DID IT

1666
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:43,901
LOOKED FOR EVIDENCE OF HUMAN

1667
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:44,701
TRAFFICKING OR DRUGS.

1668
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:48,238
AND IF THEY COULDN'T FIND IT

1669
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,273
WOULD ESSENTIALLY TREAT PEOPLE

1670
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:53,777
CROSSING THE BORDER AS SOMETHING

1671
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,912
AKIN TO A TRAFFIC VIOLATION.

1672
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:56,947
GIVE THEM A CITATION AND ASK

1673
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,983
THEM TO COME BACK TO A COURT

1674
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:00,216
DATE.

1675
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:03,587
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION MADE THE

1676
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,588
DECISION TO ASSUME AND ASSERT

1677
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,289
THROUGH THE LAW EVERYONE

1678
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,090
CROSSING IS A CRIMINAL AND MUST

1679
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:07,423
BE PROSECUTED.

1680
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:09,526
THAT'S WHEN THE FLORES DECISION

1681
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,227
CAME INTO PLAY.

1682
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,162
SO YES THIS ADMINISTRATION FOUND

1683
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:12,963
ITSELF IN THIS SITUATION.

1684
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,932
THIS ADMINISTRATION ALSO PUT

1685
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:15,799
ITSELF IN THIS SITUATION.

1686
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,402
>> MAJOR, THAT'S THE POINT THAT

1687
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,436
I WANT TO DRILL DOWN NO.

1688
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:23,273
BEING A DIGITAL NETWORK WE GET A

1689
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:27,477
LOT OF FEEDBACK IN REALTIME FROM

1690
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,178
PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

1691
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,614
THE PRESIDENT IN THE COMMENTS HE

1692
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,348
MADE THERE HE AGAIN POINTED OUT

1693
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,016
PEOPLE COMING FROM THE MIDDLE

1694
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,917
EAST, HE DIDN'T SAY TERRORISTS,

1695
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,319
HE JUST SAID PEOPLE FROM THE

1696
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:35,652
MIDDLE EAST.

1697
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:36,620
THE LANGUAGE THE PRESIDENT USED

1698
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,822
IN A TWEET YESTERDAY HE USED THE

1699
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:43,860
WORD NO MATTER HOW BAD THEY MAY

1700
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,329
BE TO POUR INTO AND INFEST.

1701
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:47,364
INFEST OUR COUNTRY LIKE MS13.

1702
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,600
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID

1703
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,334
INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT MANY OF

1704
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,102
THESE POLICIES BEGAN UNDER

1705
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:52,502
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1706
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,638
IF YOU RECALL, YOU COVERED THE

1707
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,907
OBAMA PRESIDENCY, THEY USED TO

1708
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:00,010
CALL BARACK OBAMA THE DEPORTER

1709
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,443
IN CHIEF.

1710
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:01,778
I WANT YOU TO HIGHLIGHT THE

1711
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,148
POINT YOU WERE MAKING THERE BUT

1712
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,550
EVEN WITH MORE CLARITY IF

1713
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,185
POSSIBLE THAT THE POLICIES THE

1714
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,219
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTED

1715
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,054
DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE

1716
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,954
VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN THIS 0

1717
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:13,457
TOLERANCE POLICY THAT THE

1718
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,092
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

1719
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,594
HAS IMPLEMENTED WITH THIS 0

1720
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:17,994
TOLERANCE POLICY.

1721
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:20,397
JUST BREAK THAT DOWN ONE LAST

1722
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,464
TIME FOR OUR VIEWERS.

1723
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:22,532
>> SURE AND I CAN'T GIVE

1724
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:26,737
EVERYONE MY NEW CHAPTER AND

1725
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,340
VERSE ON THIS BECAUSE I CAN ONLY

1726
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,674
WORK OFF MY IMPROPER MEMORY.

1727
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:32,542
PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT NATIONAL

1728
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:37,781
GUARD THERE, AND SENT A MESSAGE

1729
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,683
IN THE LIMITED CASES WHERE

1730
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,417
FAMILIES WERE SEPARATED WITH

1731
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,918
CHILDREN TRAVELING WITH THEM

1732
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:42,919
DON'T COME TO THE BORDER.

1733
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,488
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID SOME OF THE

1734
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:47,958
SAME WORDS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

1735
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:48,991
HAS SAID IN THIS CONTEXT.

1736
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:52,729
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH ALSO

1737
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,864
HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE

1738
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,365
BECAUSE THERE ARE SEASONAL

1739
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,834
SURGES AT THE BORDER OF ILLEGAL

1740
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:58,334
CROSSERS, THOSE WITHOUT

1741
00:48:58,334 --> 00:48:58,668
DOCUMENTATION.

1742
00:48:58,668 --> 00:48:59,903
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST PRESIDENT

1743
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,504
TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.

1744
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:03,140
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS

1745
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,141
CONTEXT TO THINK ABOUT WITH

1746
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,475
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LAST SPRING

1747
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,611
WHEN WE WERE HAVING THIS

1748
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,714
CONVERSATION ABOUT IMMIGRATION

1749
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,750
THIS WHITE HOUSE WAS TRUMPENING

1750
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,619
THE FACT THAT ILLEGAL BORDER

1751
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,253
CROSSINGS WERE WAY DOWN.

1752
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:19,189
NOW THIS YEAR THEY HAVE SEEN AN

1753
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:19,523
INCREASE.

1754
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,924
NOT AN INCREASE OF HISTORICAL

1755
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,226
SIZE MEANING SO MUCH LARGER THAN

1756
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:23,860
WE HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

1757
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,229
BUT LARGE IN RELATION TO THE

1758
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,063
DECREASE LAST YEAR.

1759
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:29,032
THAT CREATED A SENSE OF

1760
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,601
POLITICAL PANIC WITHIN THIS

1761
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:31,901
WHITE HOUSE.

1762
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:32,068
WHY?

1763
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:34,004
BECAUSE ITS HARD CORE BASE THAT

1764
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,838
WANTED STRONG BORDER SECURITY

1765
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:37,941
WAS GETTING RESTIVE ABOUT THE

1766
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:38,909
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT HADN'T

1767
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:39,910
SECURED MONEY FOR THE BORDER

1768
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,311
WALL AND WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER

1769
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,347
IF THIS PRESIDENT WAS GETTING

1770
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:44,614
WEAK ON IMMIGRATION.

1771
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:47,851
IN APRIL THIS ADMINISTRATION

1772
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,218
MADE THE 0 TOLERANCE POLICY

1773
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:49,552
ANNOUNCEMENT.

1774
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,588
AND IT HAD TO KNOW, IF IT DIDN'T

1775
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,523
KNOW IT WAS AN ACT OF POLITICAL

1776
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,291
AND PROCEDURAL MALPRACTICE NOT

1777
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,194
TO KNOW THAT THIS WOULD BE THE

1778
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:57,794
INEVITABLE RESULT, SEPARATING

1779
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,530
FAMILIES MEANING PARENTS FROM

1780
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,835
THEIR CHILDREN AND ADULTS FROM

1781
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,002
THEIR ACCOMPANIED MINORS

1782
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,037
TRAVELING WITH THEM.

1783
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,971
NOW THERE ARE ISSUES INVOLVED AS

1784
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:10,507
PAULA IDENTIFIED THERE ARE

1785
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,377
LOOPHOLES AND WAYS IN WHICH

1786
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:16,746
PEOPLE WHO SEEK ASYLUM OR

1787
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:17,547
SMUGGLERS LEARN THE CATCH

1788
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,150
PHRASES AND HAVE FOUND A WAY TO

1789
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,750
SKIRT THE SYSTEM.

1790
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,351
THAT'S NOT UNTRUE.

1791
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,719
THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THIS THAT

1792
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,454
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WHO

1793
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,388
ARE REALLY VERSED ON THIS ISSUE

1794
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:28,859
UNDERSTAND AND WOULD LIKE TO

1795
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,459
SOLVE.

1796
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,894
THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU

1797
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,329
INTRODUCE ONE IMMIGRATION ISSUE

1798
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:35,499
ON CAPITOL HILL ALL OF THE OTHER

1799
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:36,666
ISSUES THEREFORE FOLLOW.

1800
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:40,670
AND IT'S BEEN THE INABILITY TO

1801
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,072
ACHIEVE BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS ON

1802
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,307
ANY MORE THAN ONE ISSUE THAT HAS

1803
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:45,909
KEPT THIS ISSUE STALLED.

1804
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:46,843
IF THE PRESIDENT WILL SOLVE THIS

1805
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,044
ONE ISSUE THAT WILL BE A CHOICE

1806
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:51,848
TO MAKE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

1807
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:52,149
DAYS.

1808
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,450
>> MAJOR AND PAULA STAND BY.

1809
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:58,822
I WANT TO BRING IN NANCY CORTIS.

1810
00:50:58,822 --> 00:50:59,723
SHE'S BEEN GETTING REACTION FROM

1811
00:50:59,723 --> 00:50:59,990
THE HILL.

1812
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,824
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

1813
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,226
>> FOR DAYS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING

1814
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,461
TO REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WHO

1815
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,729
SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN

1816
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,130
CHANGE THIS SITUATION WITH A

1817
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,066
STROKE OF THE PEN.

1818
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:13,703
NOW THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT

1819
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,005
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WE ARE

1820
00:51:15,005 --> 00:00:00,000
TALKING ABOUT THE STROKE OF A
