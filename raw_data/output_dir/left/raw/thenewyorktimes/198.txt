1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,850
Colombian police
scour the streets

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,330
looking for undocumented
migrants.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,890
All of them are Venezuelan,
selling whatever they can.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,280
Water, work, sex.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,990
The officers enter a
nightclub and round up

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,600
more than 30 prostitutes.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,510
Jocelin, that’s her working name,

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,750
wants me to see a picture of
her nephew back in Venezuela.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,260
She tells me he died of
malnutrition a month ago.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,880
She’s hiding her
face from the camera

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,770
because her husband
and three children

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,510
don’t know how she pays
for the food they eat.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,580
They think she’s in 
Colombia waiting tables.

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,560
I’m here in the border
town of Cúcuta

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,920
as Venezuela prepares to hold
its first presidential election

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,680
since Nicolas Maduro took
power and began silencing

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,470
his opposition, and since
the country’s oil-based

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,270
economy collapsed.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,050
It caps a year in which hundreds
of thousands fled the country.

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,700
And so I thought if people can’t
speak freely inside Venezuela

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,860
perhaps they would here,
once they cross over

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,020
the border into Colombia.

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,730
But I quickly find
that people aren’t

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,920
thinking about the election.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,730
They’re just trying
to survive.

26
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,970
The Simón Bolívar
International Bridge

27
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,730
is the busiest point
of exodus

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,320
for Venezuelans.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,270
But it’s not a one-way street.

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,170
Thirty-five thousand
march across each day,

31
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,200
often going back and forth,

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,680
to buy basic things they can’t
get or afford in their country

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,810
like rice and toilet paper.

34
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,670
A shortage of
medical supplies has

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,510
hundreds of women coming
over just to have their baby.

36
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,340
But more and more
Venezuelans crossing

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,020
are just looking for a
new start somewhere else.

38
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,830
With so many Venezuelans
pouring in,

39
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,030
the Colombian government
stopped issuing temporary visas,

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,140
and this has made it harder

41
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,120
for refugees to
earn a living here.

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,380
Those fortunate to have
passports and enough cash

43
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,970
travel on to
other countries

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,460
where they hope
to find jobs.

45
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,270
The less fortunate scramble.

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,350
And rumors are
flying. A popular one

47
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,240
is that Americans are
paying for bus tickets

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,420
to other South
American countries.

49
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,920
I’m filming at
the bridge one day

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,340
when a woman
comes up to ask

51
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,980
if we’re the Americans
giving out aid.

52
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,780
Yuliana and Ivan took
a 14-hour bus ride

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,122
on a leap of faith that
this rumor was true.

54
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,800
Until a year ago,
they were still O.K.:

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,620
a comfortable middle-class 
family in Venezuela.

56
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,260
Then, out-of-control inflation
made living so expensive,

57
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,780
they were down to
one meal a day.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,820
And then they lost
their apartment.

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,700
Now they’re homeless
on the street with a baby

60
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,760
and no prospect for work.

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,010
Once over the bridge,

62
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,650
they’re hit by the chaos
of this place known simply

63
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,550
as la parada, the stopping place.

64
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,950
It’s an unfortunate
but apt description

65
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,100
of what happens to many
families who flee,

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,085
only to find themselves
stuck here.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,850
Like Hector Mendoza: He
left his farm in Venezuela

68
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,010
when he could no longer
find the seeds, chemicals

69
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,950
or tractor parts he
needed to keep it going.

70
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,740
He arrived in Cúcuta three months
ago with his pregnant wife

71
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,720
and two kids.

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,670
They’ve been camping
near the central plaza

73
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,849
for two months, surviving on a
diet of junk food and handouts.

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,460
He makes small change
holding places

75
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,310
in the long line for
Western Union.

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,260
At night his family beds down
on sheets of cardboard.

77
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,500
Mildred Rosales is trying to

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,860
buy her teenage daughter
a bus ticket to Peru.

79
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,850
She’s selling her
wedding ring to do it.

80
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,010
Just outside the jewelry shop,

81
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,640
another family says goodbye.

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,490
This time it’s the mother
who’s leaving to Peru.

83
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,780
Her son Yershey walks back to
Venezuela with his aunt and uncle.

84
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,180
Their plan is to keep
saving money until they can

85
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,770
afford to send someone else.

86
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,710
If President Maduro
solidifies his grip on power

87
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,300
and his country of
about 30 million

88
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,880
continues to suffer
from crime and poverty,

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,910
an even larger
exodus may be coming.

90
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,910
What happens in Venezuela
could destabilize

91
00:05:36,910 --> 00:00:00,000
the entire continent.
