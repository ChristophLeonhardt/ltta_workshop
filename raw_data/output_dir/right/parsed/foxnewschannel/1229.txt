>> NOT ONLY ABSOLUTELY GREAT
NUMBER.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST
MONTHLY NUMBERS I HAVE EVER
SEEN FOR BLACK PEOPLE, EVER.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR
BLACK PEOPLE WENT FROM 6.6
TO 5.9%.
ABSOLUTELY THE LOWEST EVER.
BUT, HERE'S THE KICKER.
LABOR PARTICIPATION, 76,000
BLACKS CAME INTO THE LABOR
MARK.
EVERY OTHER RACE SAW PEOPLE
LEAVE THE LABOR MARK.
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE
STUFF.
PETE: HISTORIC NUMBERS
COMING IN YESTERDAY.
HERE TO REACT CANDACE OWENS
TURNING POINT U.S.A.
YOU CONTINUE TO HIT THE
TRAIL TO AMAZING CROWDS
WHICH I SEE ONLINE.
WELL DONE.
>> THANK YOU.
PETE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
NUMBERS HISTORICALLY LOW
OVERALL BUT FOR BLACKS.
>> WONDERFUL NEWS.
CANNOT BE OVERSTATED WHAT
THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE FOR
THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
HOPE IS INSPIRING AND
ECONOMIC GROWTH HE HAS
INSPIRED WITHIN THIS
COUNTRY.
I HAVE HEARD ANTJUAN SAY IN
THE LAST SEGMENT THANK YOU
OBAMA.
THAT'S A DELUSIONAL COMMENT.
EITHER HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
ECONOMIC POLICY OR HE
DOESN'T WANT TO.
BUT THIS IS DIRECTLY
CORRELATED TO THE WORK HE
HAS DONE TO SHRINK
GOVERNMENT AND TO SLASH
REGULATIONS AND I'M JUST SO
PROUD AND IT'S A GREAT TIME
TO BE A BLACK AMERICAN.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.
ABBY: WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE
DONE.
>> HE NEEDS TO CONTINUE DOWN
THE SAME PATH HE IS ON.
BEST THING WE CAN DO IS GET
THE MESSAGE OUT THERE TO THE
BLACK COMMUNITY.
WHEN YOU SEE THAT THAT'S WHY
WHEN I GETDOWN SET WHEN
SOMEONE LIKE ANTJUAN SAYS
THANK YOU, OBAMA.
AND PRETENDS THIS IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT
HAS DONE.
PETE: RACIST AND RACIST
POLICY HOW DO YOU BRIDGE
THAT.
>> DESTROY THE LEFT'S
RHETORIC.
THEY USE FEAR POLITICKING TO
STRAP BLACK PEOPLE INTO THIS
HELPLESSNESS AND TO MORE
FOOD STAMPS.
THEY SAY THAT'S A PLUS.
RIGHT?
BUT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT,
THAT'S A LOW.
THEN WHEN THEY ACKNOWLEDGE
IT'S A POSITIVE, THEY SAY
THAT'S BECAUSE OF OBAMA
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT
BLACK INDIVIDUALS AREN'T
SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND
ECONOMIC POLICY.
ABBY: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
HAVE SEEN.
PETE: POWERFUL.
ABBY: SOME OF OUR TEASES ON
THE SHOW WE WANTED TO ASK
YOU PARTICULARLY ABOUT THIS.
STUDENTS WERE ASKED WHO THEY
WOULD RATHER GANG AN -- THIS
IS NOT A JOKE, AN MS-13 GANG
MEMBER OR TRUMP SUPPORTER.
WATCH HOW THIS PLAYED OUT.
>> OH, GANG MEMBER.
>> GIVE ME THE GANG MEMBER.
>> I'M GOING TO GO MS-13.
>> YEAH.
PROBABLY MS-13 MEMBER.
>> NEITHER.
I WILL STAY SINGLE.
>> I GUESS A TRUMP SUPPORTER
BECAUSE I GUESS AT LEAST
THEY STAND FOR SOMETHING.
>> WHY AN MS-13 MEMBER.
>> I LIVED IN BOLIVIA I
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF
THE CULTURE.
>> A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS
WERE PROBABLY RAISED BY RICH
WHITE DADS AND HAVE LOTS OF
MONEY AND BREAD INTO BEING
TRUMP SUPPORTERS.
>> ONE TRUMP SUPPORTER THEY
WOULD DATE BECAUSE AT LEAST
HE STANDS FOR SOMETHING.
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED
WHATSOEVER.
LIKE YOU SAID, IT'S NOT A
JOKE.
WE CON FRONT THIS ALL THE
TIME ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
THERE IS A DEPARTURE FROM
REALITY THAT IS GOING ON.
ABBY: DO THEY KNOW WHAT AN
MS-13 IS.
>> THEY DO KNOW.
THEY KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS
RAPE.
THEY KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS
KILL.
WE SAW THEY DEFENDED THESE
INDIVIDUALS AGAINST BEING
CALLED ANIMALS BUT THEY ARE
VERY HAPPY WHEN TRUMP
SUPPORTERS ARE CALLED
RACISTS AND SEXIST AND A
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT NAMES.
AND THIS IS DIRECTLY LEANS
TO THE LEFT RHETORIC AND THE
LEFT WHICH PERPETUATE THIS.
THERE IS MASSIVE
BRAINWASHING THEY ARE TRYING
TO DO AND REINFORCING.
WE SEE THIS ALL THE TIME.
ABBY: ROSEANNE BAR LAST WEEK
YEAH THERE MAY BE A DOUBLE
STANDARD.
THE HATE SPEECH IS ACROSS
THE BOARD AND A PROBLEM WE
HAVE RIGHT NOW AND AS A
COUNTRY GOT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO STOP ALL THE HATE.
>> THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING
TO DO.
GO ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND
SAY LOOK I SUPPORT DONALD
TRUMP.
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE I'M A
RACIST AND I'M A SEXIST I'M
A MISOGYNIST?
I'M TELLING MY STORY.
WE TRY TO NORMALIZE THE
CONVERSATION AND SAY YOU
DON'T HAVE TO SUPPORT DONALD
TRUMP.
CAN YOU BE A LITTLE MORE
REALISTIC IN TERMS OF THE
PEOPLE THAT DO?
PETE: YOU ARE A TRUMP
SUPPORTER.
CAN WE CONFIRM ON THAT LAST
SEGMENT WERE YOU RAISED BY A
RICH WHITE MAN.
>> IRS NOT RAISED BY A RICH
WHITE MAN.
PETE: I WANTED TO CHECK.
CHRIS MATTHEWS SAYS YOU HAVE
TO PLAY GOLF AND READ THE
"WALL STREET JOURNAL."
>> I DON'T PLAY GOLF.
I DO READ THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL."
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
THERE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ME
