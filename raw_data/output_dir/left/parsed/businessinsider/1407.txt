the line that people use is we always we
always try to bring our people home and
and that is true but it is also true
that in wartime we have had people who
were held prisoner for years whether it
was in Vietnam or Korea or World War two
you don't bring them home at all costs
and you don't bring them at home in a
way that might further endanger other
troops was important eventually to have
the soldier brought home but it seemed
to me that the price of returning
several terrorists to Afghanistan or
letting them go was too high priced
