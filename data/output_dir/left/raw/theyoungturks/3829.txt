1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,820
AS OF NOW, THERE ARE STILL
MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,240
REGARD TO THE TERROR ATTACK IN
LONDON, THIS IS REGARDING THE

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,410
TERROR ATTACK THAT HAS INJURED
22 INDIVIDUALS, LUCKILY THERE

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,179
HAVE BEEN NO FATALITIES.

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,920
EVEN
THOUGH NOTHING IS CONFIRMED IN

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,890
TERMS OF WHO DECIDED TO DETONATE
THIS HOMEMADE BOMB INSIDE A

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,029
LONDON TRAIN, DONALD TRUMP HAS
ALREADY TWEETED ABOUT THIS.

8
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,029
HE

9
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,339
TWEETED IMMEDIATELY AND HAS
ALREADY SPECULATED IN TERMS OF

10
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,999
WHO CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK.

11
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,371
I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLES, HE

12
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:42,960
TWEETED --

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,420
LET'S JUST PAUSE THERE AND
BREAK DOWN EACH TWEET.

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,420
AS I SAID

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,850
IN THE EARLIER STORY, I KNOW IT
SOUNDS GOOFY CALLING THE LOSER

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,390
TERRORISTS, I THINK IT'S FINE.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,600
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE WINNERS,

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,570
THEY WANT TO GET GLORY AND
HONOR, AND IF YOU RIDICULE THEM

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,660
AND CALL THEM WHAT THEY ARE,
WHICH IS LOSERS, THEY COULDN'T

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,170
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING IN THEIR
LIVES SO THEY HAD TO GO TO

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,820
VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION TO DO
IT, IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,500
CHILDISH TO SOME OF US BUT I
DON'T THINK SO, I THINK IT'S A

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,890
FINE THING TO SAY.

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,070
NOW, AS I
READ THE REST OF THE TWEET, I

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,140
WAS LIKE, WAIT, YOU ARE SAYING
SCOTLAND YARD IS ON IT, THERE'S

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,910
NO WAY SCOTLAND YARD ALREADY
WANTED TO ANNOUNCE SOMETHING,

27
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,710
UNLESS THEY ALREADY CAUGHT THE
GUYS, BUT I ALREADY READ THEY

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,260
DIDN'T CATCH THE GUYS.

29
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,120
SO
GODDAMN IT, DID YOU ACCIDENTALLY

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,780
GIVE OUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
AGAIN, YOU KNUCKLEHEAD?

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,780
AND THEN

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,210
I GO TO SCOTLAND YARD'S
STATEMENTS ON IT, AND THEY GO WE

33
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,780
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO WE
MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE TRACKING.

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,390
IN OTHER WORDS, THE IDIOT U.S.
PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN GAVE

35
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,790
INFORMATION HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN.

36
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,270
AND THE LAST SENTENCE

37
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,270
THERE IS, WHAT WAS IT, ANA?

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,590
MUST
BE PROACTIVE.

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,590
I MEAN, IF YOU

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,640
MEAN THAT SCOTLAND YARD AND OUR
AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE PROACTIVE

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,880
IN TRACKING TERRORISTS, OF
COURSE THEY SHOULD!

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
IF YOU MEAN

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,310
PROACTIVE IN, WHAT, LATER HE'S
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TRAVEL

44
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,019
BAN -- PROACTIVELY TARGETING ALL
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN A CERTAIN

45
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:12,019
CATEGORY?

46
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:14,459
THEN NO, YOU WOULD BE
WASTING SCOTLAND YARD'S

47
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,730
RESOURCES WHEN THEY SHOULD BE
TRACKING LEADS SO THEY CAN STOP

48
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,220
BOMBINGS LIKE THIS.

49
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,180
THEN AGAIN
UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE BACK TO YOU

50
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,200
BEING AN IDIOT.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,379
HE CONTINUES ON WITH --

52
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:36,110
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, THIS IS WAY
WORSE.

53
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,680
YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,829
TERRORISTS IN A TOUGHER MANNER?

55
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:39,829
FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE THE DEATH

56
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:45,519
PENALTY IN AMERICA, SO WE CAN
EXECUTE THEM -- TOUGHER HOW?

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,439
THAT'S IN THE U.K., THEY DON'T
HAVE THE DEATH PENALTY BUT THEIR

58
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,159
MAXIMUM PENALTY IS LIFE IN
PRISON, SO THEY ARE PRESUMABLY

59
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,590
WORKING HARD AS THEY CAN.

60
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,969
HE
DOESN'T MEAN THAT, HE MEANS

61
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,140
DON'T TARGET THAT TERRORIST WHO
DID THAT, TARGET OTHER PEOPLE

62
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,540
WHO DIDN'T DO IT.

63
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,989
LIKE MY STUPID
MUSLIM BAN.

64
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,700
OR TOUGHER AS IN GO

65
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,359
BOMB RANDOM PLACES IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.

66
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,719
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND SEEK

67
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,650
JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
ACTUALLY DID THIS?

68
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,650
BUT THE

69
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,650
SECOND PART IS MUCH WORSE.

70
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,549
THE
INTERNET IS WHAT THEY USE, SO WE

71
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:20,609
HAVE TO STOP IT?

72
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,159
OH NO, NO, WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO -- NOW HE'S

73
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,989
GOING TO COME UP WITH
REGULATIONS ON -- FIRST OF ALL I

74
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,049
THOUGHT YOU WERE AGAINST
REGULATIONS -- REGULATIONS TO

75
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,239
STOP FREE SPEECH ON THE
INTERNET?

76
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,629
OR BETTER USE THE

77
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:34,629
INTERNET?

78
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:36,620
WHAT THE HELL DOES
THAT MEAN?

79
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,939
OBVIOUSLY THAT KIND OF
STATEMENT ISN'T READILY

80
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,469
DANGEROUS FOR ANYONE WHO
BELIEVES IN A FREE AND OPEN

81
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:47,900
INTERNET, AND I WOULD BE MORE
CONCERNED IF I THOUGHT OF TRUMP

82
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,120
AS SOMEONE WHO THINKS ANYTHING
THROUGH.

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
HE DOESN'T THINK

84
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
ANYTHING THROUGH.

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,389
HE DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE A REAL POLITICAL

86
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:56,909
IDEOLOGY, WHICH IS THE REASON
HE'S JUMPING FROM ONE POLITICAL

87
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,370
PARTY TO THE OTHER AT THE
MOMENT, WHICH IS FRUSTRATING A

88
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,360
LOT OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,609
BUT HE JUST SAYS THINGS WITHOUT

90
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,349
THINKING ABOUT THE
RAMIFICATIONS.

91
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,349
OBVIOUSLY THAT

92
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,690
CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS,
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S UNWITTINGLY

93
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,430
LEAKING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
PERTAINING TO AN INVESTIGATION

94
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,529
ON A TERRORIST ATTACK, BUT IN
THIS CASE, OKAY, HE'S SAYING

95
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,988
THIS, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE A
PLAN, HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL

96
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,289
THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND IT, HE'S
JUST -- HE'S JUST NOT FIT TO BE

97
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,289
PRESIDENT.

98
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:29,370
HE DOESN'T THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING HE DOES BEFORE HE

99
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,800
DOESN'T, HE DOESN'T THINK ABOUT
ANYTHING HE SAYS BEFORE HE SAYS

100
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
IT.

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,289
AND I'M SORRY, ANA, YOU ARE
1000% RIGHT -- IF YOU ARE A

102
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,810
RIGHT-WINGER WATCHING THIS
ONLINE, YOU REALLY WANT HIM TO

103
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,509
COME AS HE SAID, QUOTE, CUT OFF
THE INTERNET?

104
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:45,509
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

105
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:46,509
MEANS?

106
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,509
NOBODY DOES.

107
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,030
TRUMP
DOESN'T. AND IF HE ACTUALLY

108
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,030
MEANS IT, LET'S ASSUME HE'S
STUPID OR A LIAR LIKE YOU

109
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,940
PROBABLY ASSUME THE SAME -- BUT
IF HE MEANT IT AND YOU BELIEVE

110
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,040
IN YOUR BELOVED TRUMP AND HE'S
GOING TO CUT OFF THE INTERNET,

111
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,009
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

112
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,500
YOU LIVE ON THE INTERNET, RIGHT?

113
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,689
THAT'S SO PREPOSTEROUS AND
STUPID, AND IT GOES ALONG THE

114
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:10,320
SAME LINES AS THE MUSLIM BAN.

115
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
LET'S NOT GET THE GUY WHO

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,430
ACTUALLY DID IT, LET'S JUST GOT
OFF THE INTERNET FOR EVERYBODY.

117
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,490
JESUS CHRIST.

118
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,159
LET'S NOT GET THE
GUY WHO DID IT, INSTEAD LET'S

119
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:21,889
BAN RANDOM PEOPLE FROM YEMEN OR
SUDAN.

120
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:26,210
RIGHT, AND ALSO THE INTERNET
CAN BE A GREAT TOOL FOR

121
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:32,150
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE
HYPER FOCUSED ON MONITORING

122
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,880
EXTREMISTS RATHER THAN
INDISCRIMINATELY COLLECTING

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,470
METADATA ON EVERYONE.

124
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,090
ONE MORE THING ABOUT THAT.

125
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,341
IF
I'M THE PRESIDENT, WHETHER IT

126
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:48,479
WAS OBAMA OR TRUMP, I'M FURIOUS
AT OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.

127
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,479
AL

128
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,479
QAEDA HAS A MAGAZINE.

129
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,930
JESUS
CHRIST, IT'S CALLED INSPIRE

130
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,530
MAGAZINE -- VERY INSPIRATIONAL
-- AND THEY RECENTLY PUT OUT A

131
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,400
THING SAYING TO BOMBINGS ON
TRAINS, AND HERE WE HAVE A

132
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,550
BOMBING ON A TRAIN.

133
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,300
YOU CAN'T
TRACK THEIR MAGAZINE ONLINE?

134
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,300
YOU

135
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,620
CAN'T TRACK THEIR TWEETS AND
FIGURE OUT WHO IS SAYING IT, AND

136
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,860
THEN TARGET THEM AND GET THEM?

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,500
AND WE HAVE THEIR LEADERS

138
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,250
RUNNING AROUND, DECADE AFTER
DECADE -- WHAT THE HELL DO WE

139
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,180
HAVE INTELLIGENCE FOR?

140
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,610
TO
RANDOMLY SPY ON US?

141
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,610
TO DO

142
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,169
WARRANTLESS SEARCHES ON
AMERICANS AND NOT ACTUALLY CATCH

143
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:25,169
THE BAD GUYS?

144
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,169
I WOULD GO OUT
THERE WASTING THE TIME OF

145
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:32,150
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ON BLANKET
GO SCOUR THE ENTIRE INTERNET OR

146
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,180
1.6 BILLION MUSLIMS, I WOULD BE
LIKE GET ME THE SONS OF BITCHES

147
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,819
FOR PUTTING THIS MESSAGE OUT.

148
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,770
AL
QAEDA HAS BETTER TECH THAN WE

149
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,770
DO?

150
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,240
I WOULD FIRE EVERYONE IN THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND HIRE

151
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,509
THE BEST TECH GUYS IN THE WORLD,
DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO FIND OUT

152
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,909
WHERE THESE GUYS ARE WHO ARE
BOMBING US.

153
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,909
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD

154
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,169
USE OF INTELLIGENCE SERVICES,
AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T

155
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,139
DEMANDED THAT OF THEM IS
DISGRACEFUL.

156
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,830
THE TWEETS GET WORSE, BECAUSE
HE HASN'T YET SPECULATED IN

157
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:18,669
TERMS OF WHO THE TERRORISTS ARE,
BUT HE'S ABOUT TO DO SO --

158
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,860
I WANT TO STOP FOR A SECOND
WITH THIS TWEET ESPECIALLY,

159
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,139
BECAUSE ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I GET
IT, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO

160
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,689
SPECULATE THAT THE PERSON WHO
CARRIED OUT -- FOR THE PEOPLE

161
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,680
WHO CARRIED OUT -- THIS ATTACK
ARE MUSLIM EXTREMISTS.

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
HOWEVER,

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,560
AS THE PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULDN'T
SPECULATE.

164
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
YOU SHOULD WAIT UNTIL

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,010
YOU GET THE FACTS AND THEN MAKE
YOUR STATEMENT.

166
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,110
AND LOOK, IF YOU

167
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,789
DISAGREE WITH THAT POINT I JUST
MADE, KEEP IN MIND, DONALD

168
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,750
TRUMP'S REACTION, OR
NON-REACTION, TO HEATHER HEYER

169
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,749
GETTING MURDERED AT THAT HATE
RALLY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE,

170
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:55,289
VIRGINIA, AND THEN WHEN HE GOT
CRITICIZED FOR DELAYING A

171
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,470
REACTION, AND THEN REFUSING
TO CONDEMN THE WHITE

172
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,470
SUPREMACISTS, HERE IS
WHAT HIS EXCUSE WAS.

173
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,710
TAKE A LOOK.

174
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,710
HERE IS THE THING, WHEN I MAKE
A STATEMENT I LIKE TO BE

175
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,710
CORRECT.

176
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,710
I WANT THE FACTS.

177
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,520
THIS
EVENT JUST HAPPENED, IN FACT A

178
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,180
LOT OF THE EVENT DIDN'T EVEN
HAPPEN YET AS WE WERE SPEAKING,

179
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,979
THIS EVENT JUST HAPPENED.

180
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,740
BEFORE
I MAKE A STATEMENT I NEED THE

181
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,860
FACTS, SO I DON'T WANT TO RUSH
INTO A STATEMENT, SO MAKING THE

182
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,319
STATEMENT WHEN I MADE IT WAS
EXCELLENT.

183
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,340
SO WHERE ARE THE FACTS?

184
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,469
BECAUSE AGAIN, FOR A REGULAR,

185
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:32,539
AVERAGE JOE TO SPECULATE AMONG
FRIENDS, THAT IS ONE THING,

186
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,959
THAT'S FINE, AND I GET THE URGE
TO SPECULATE.

187
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
WHAT YOU ARE THE

188
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,100
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
YOU CAN'T HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD

189
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,640
WHEN IT COMES TO AN AMERICAN
GETTING MURDERED BY A WHITE

190
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,530
SUPREMACIST IN OUR OWN COUNTRY.

191
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,050
IT'S A GREAT POINT BY ANA.

192
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,200
LET'S QUICKLY REVIEW, AND I

193
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,540
AGREE WITH YOU, WE ARE TALKSHOW
HOSTS, WE ARE ALLOWED TO

194
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,350
SPECULATE, WE THINK IT'S LIKELY
MUSLIM EXTREMISTS BECAUSE AL

195
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,020
QAEDA ASKED PEOPLE TO DO THAT
SPECIFIC ATTACK, IT HAS HAPPENED

196
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,290
BEFORE, BUT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY
OPEN-MINDED THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE

197
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,980
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF
TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, THERE

198
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,870
ARE SOME RIGHT-WING TERRORISTS,
LEFT-WING TERRORISTS USUALLY GO

199
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,780
AFTER, LIKE, ANIMAL FARMS OR
WHATEVER THEY DO -- ANYWAY,

200
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,220
OPEN-MINDED.

201
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,660
FINE.

202
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,980
BUT YOU ARE
THE PRESIDENT, YOU JUST TOLD US

203
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,170
THAT THE STANDARD IS, IF THERE
ARE TERRORISTS, AND

204
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,580
CHARLOTTESVILLE WAS AN ACT OF
DOMESTIC TERRORISM ACCORDING TO

205
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,880
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, ETC.,
THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE

206
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,160
OF DAYS AND GET ALL OF YOUR
FACTS.

207
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,270
BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS

208
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,630
JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS, AND
SCOTLAND YARD SAID PLEASE DON'T

209
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,770
PUT OUT A STATEMENT.

210
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,220
THERESA MAY
HAD TO SAY NO ONE SHOULD PUT OUT

211
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,190
A STATEMENT IF THEY DON'T HAVE
ALL THE FACTS, MEETING, LIKE,

212
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,540
DONALD TRUMP, SHUT UP.

213
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,150
INSTEAD
HE THINKS IT'S MUSLIMS SO HE

214
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,840
JUMPS RIGHT IN IT. AND DONALD
TRUMP, ARE YOU GOING TO SAY

215
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,960
THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH
SIDES?

216
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
ARE YOU GOING TO SAY THAT

217
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
ABOUT THIS?

218
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,640
WHEN IT WAS DOMESTIC
TERRORISM, OUR COUNTRY, YOU ARE

219
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,790
OUR PRESIDENT, WHEN SOMEONE GOT
MURDERED, GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH

220
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,790
SIDES.

221
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,600
HE IS SO DESPICABLE.

222
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,880
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY,
YOU ARE COVERING IT VERY GOOD, I

223
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,670
JUST WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, HOW DO
WE HANDLE THIS NOW?

224
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,860
I LIKE WHAT

225
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
YOU SAID.

226
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,570
WE ARE THE ONLY ONES
UNDER SURVEILLANCE?

227
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,570
WHY DO WE

228
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,060
HAVE ALL THIS SURVEILLANCE IF WE
CAN'T FIND THESE GUYS, THEY HAVE

229
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,560
A MAGAZINE, THAT'S A GREAT
POINT.

230
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
THE UNITED STATES

231
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,630
GOVERNMENT JUST DECIDED TO SPEND
$100 BILLION MORE ON DEFENSE

232
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,200
THAN THEY SPENT LAST YEAR.

233
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,080
$100
BILLION MORE.

234
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
ARE WE GOING TO

235
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,590
USE THAT MONEY EXACTLY THE SAME
WAY?

236
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,950
YES.

237
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,950
WHAT WOULD BE BETTER

238
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,980
TO STOP TERRORISM?

239
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,870
WHAT ARE THE
ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM?

240
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,870
NOBODY

241
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,060
EVER TALKS ABOUT THE ROOT CAUSES
OF TERRORISM THE WAY THEY

242
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,890
SHOULD.

243
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,680
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 7
MILLION PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW

244
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,200
WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING
FROM IN YEMEN, AND THERE WERE

245
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,720
13,000 CIVILIANS KILLED AND ONE
YEAR, FROM MARCH 2015 TO MARCH

246
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,450
2016, THAT THE ALLIED BOMBING
CAMPAIGN, KILLED 13,000

247
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,410
CIVILIANS.

248
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,680
WHY ARE WE FIGHTING SAUDI
ARABIA'S WAR IN YEMEN?

249
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,580
THE PETRODOLLAR, THAT'S WHY WE
ARE THERE.

250
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
EXACTLY.

251
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:29,310
SO WHEN YEMEN IS
FACING FAMINE, INNOCENT FAMILY

252
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,230
MEMBERS, CHILDREN, GETTING
MURDERED ON OUR WATCH BECAUSE OF

253
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,050
OUR ACTIONS, YOU THINK THAT
LEADS TO LOVE TOWARD THE UNITED

254
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,510
STATES OR THE WESTERN WORLD?

255
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,140
PEOPLE WILL TAKE THAT AND SAY
YOU ARE MAKING EXCUSES FOR

256
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
THE TERRORISTS.

257
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,240
NO, WE ARE TRYING --

258
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,620
THOSE TERRORISTS WHO CARRY OUT
THOSE ACTIONS NEED TO BE BROUGHT

259
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,330
TO JUSTICE, RIGHT?

260
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,980
BUT YOU ALSO
HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND

261
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,260
THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT OUR
FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN WORKING,

262
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,340
AND IT IS NOT WORKING.

263
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,780
IT IS
DRAINING OUR RESOURCES, KILLING

264
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,790
OUR SOLDIERS AND MEMBERS OF OUR
MILITARY, IT IS KILLING

265
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,720
COUNTLESS CIVILIANS ABROAD.

266
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,170
BANKRUPTING OUR TREASURY.

267
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,230
MY
POINT IS, WHAT IF WE TOOK THAT

268
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,660
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE
DON'T NEED TO SPEND, WHICH WE

269
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,760
ARE SPENDING BECAUSE IT'S A
GIVEAWAY TO THE MILITARY

270
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,810
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, AND TRY TO
HELP PEOPLE IN YEMEN INSTEAD OF

271
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,690
TRYING TO KILL THEM AT THE
BEHEST OF SAUDI ARABIA?

272
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,690
I THINK

273
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,410
THAT'S A BETTER ANTITERRORISM
TACTIC THAN TO KEEP TRYING TO

274
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,860
BLOW UP PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR AND
DESPERATE.

275
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,730
LET ME COMMENT FURTHER ON
THAT.

276
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,770
FIRST OF ALL THIS IS PART

277
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,840
OF THE PROBLEM OF CORRUPTION.

278
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,590
YOU SAY WAIT, WHAT DOES

279
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,950
CORRUPTION HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

280
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,850
WE ALLOW LEGALIZED BRIBERY IN

281
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,420
AMERICA, SO WHAT DO DEFENSE
CONTRACTORS DO?

282
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,970
THEY WANT $100

283
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,060
BILLION EXTRA SO THEY GO AND
BRIBE ALMOST ALL OF OUR

284
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,760
POLITICIANS, AND BY THE WAY THEY
ALSO PUT ADS ON TELEVISION EVEN

285
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,210
THOUGH THEY DON'T SELL ANYTHING
TO CONSUMERS.

286
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,210
WHY DO THEY HAVE

287
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,020
ADS ON TV?

288
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,530
CAN YOU BUY A
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR JET OR AN

289
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,550
AIRCRAFT CARRIER?

290
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,180
KNOW, BUT THEY
HAVE ADS ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY ARE

291
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,700
BUYING TV'S COMPLIANCE.

292
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,950
IT'S NOT
AN ACCIDENT THAT YOU HAVE VAPID

293
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,690
PEOPLE LIKE JOE SCARBOROUGH ON
TV, HE'S PAID TO BE STUPID.

294
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,760
HE

295
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,010
FAMOUSLY SAID WHEN THEY WERE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY

296
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,620
SOMETIMES WE ARE ATTACKED BY
MUSLIM RADICALS, HE SAID THEY

297
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,930
HATE US BECAUSE THEY HATE US.

298
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,340
HE
REPEATED IS THREE TIMES, THAT

299
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,800
WAS HIS GENIUS CONCLUSION, HIS
INTELLECT, HIS SCHOLARLY WORK,

300
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,550
LED HIM TO CONCLUDE THEY HATE US
BECAUSE THEY HATE US.

301
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,740
WELL, WHO

302
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,370
WOULD PAY SOMEONE TO SAY SUCH A
STUPID THING TO A NATIONAL

303
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,370
AUDIENCE?

304
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,290
WELL, THE PEOPLE WHO
THINK, DON'T TELL THEM THE

305
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,050
TRUTH, DON'T ACTUALLY TRY TO
SOLVE THE PROBLEM, JUST PUT OUT

306
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,150
A BUNCH OF IDIOTS WHO WILL GO,
HEY, IF YOU ARE TRYING TO FIND

307
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,540
OUT THE ROOT CAUSE OF TERRORISM,
INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT'S GREAT,

308
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,790
SO WE CAN STOP TERRORISM -- NO,
WE ARE GOING TO YELL AT YOU AND

309
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,480
SAY ARE YOU TRYING TO BLAME BOTH
SIDES?

310
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S OUR

311
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
FAULT?

312
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,410
NO, WE ARE AMERICA AND
EVERYTHING WE DO IS WONDERFUL

313
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,150
AND PERFECT AND THEY HATE US
BECAUSE THEY HATE US.

314
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,150
I DON'T

315
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,130
WANT TO FIGURE IT OUT, I WOULD
LIKE TO BE PROACTIVELY STUPID

316
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,520
LIKE JOE SCARBOROUGH.

317
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,760
THAT IS
WHAT THEY GET PAID FOR, TO BE

318
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
STUPID.

319
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
LET'S NOT MAKE THAT
MISTAKE.

320
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,330
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT

321
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,580
FOR A SECOND, WHY DO WE HAVE
RADICAL ISLAM RUNNING AROUND?

322
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
I

323
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,570
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE WHOLE
DISSERTATION ON IT, GO BACK AND

324
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,600
WATCH THE VIDEO I DID EXPLAINING
HOW THE GODDAMN SAUDIS FUNDED

325
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,800
MEDIA AND CHANGE THE CULTURE ALL
AROUND THE MUSLIM WORLD AND WENT

326
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,550
TO RADICALISM AND VIOLENCE
BECAUSE OF THE WAHHABI STRAIN OF

327
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,640
ISLAM, THAT WASN'T DOMINANT
ISLAM UNTIL THE SAUDIS PAID FOR

328
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,590
MEDIA ACROSS THE WORLD.

329
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,100
AND THE
UNITED STATES HELP THEM.

330
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
WHY DID

331
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
WE DO IT?

332
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,680
NOT BECAUSE WE ARE
MALICIOUS AND BAD GUYS, ETC.,

333
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,310
THE BLACK-AND-WHITE WORLD
DOESN'T EXIST IN EITHER

334
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,490
DIRECTION -- NO, WE DID IT
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IF WE

335
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,920
RADICALIZE MUSLIMS, THEY WILL BE
MORE DEVOUT AND FIGHT THE

336
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,290
GODLESS COMMUNISTS.

337
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,130
BECAUSE WE
WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COLD

338
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,070
WAR. AND WE SAID OH MY GOD, THEY
ARE ATHEISTS, THAT DAMN SOVIET

339
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,410
UNION AND COMMUNISTS, GO GET
THEM, BECOME MORE RELIGIOUS.

340
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,410
AND

341
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,350
NOT JUST MORE RELIGIOUS TO HELP
THE POOR AND THE NEEDY, NO,

342
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,360
RELIGION MEANS YOU SHOULD PICK
UP A GUN AND FIRE AT THE

343
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,940
SOVIETS.

344
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,440
SO WE HELPED THE SAUDIS
SPREAD THAT POISON THROUGHOUT

345
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,590
THE WORLD, AND GUESS WHAT
HAPPENED?

346
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,000
IT BLEW UP IN OUR

347
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
FACE.

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
YES THE SOVIET UNION IS
GONE, NOW THEY ARE ATTACKING US.

349
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,150
AND INSTEAD OF FIGURING OUT HEY,
MAYBE THAT WAS A BAD IDEA, MAYBE

350
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,730
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SPREAD THAT
IDEOLOGY AND ALSO GIVEN THEM

351
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,790
WEAPONS, WHICH THEN, A GUY NAMED
BIN LADEN WHO WE HELPED AND

352
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,280
FUNDED AND SUPPORTED IN
AFGHANISTAN, THAT'S A FACT, THEN

353
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,190
TURNED AROUND AND USED IT
AGAINST US.

354
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,410
MAYBE THE LESSON

355
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,230
FROM THAT IS, DON'T FUND THEM
AND GIVE THEM WEAPONS IN THE

356
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,670
FIRST PLACE.

357
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,790
MAYBE JIMMY IS
RIGHT, THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

358
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,790
LEARN FROM HISTORY.

359
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,740
SO WHAT IS
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PLAN THE

360
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,800
UNITED STATES HAS EVER DONE IN
FOREIGN POLICY?

361
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
THE MARSHALL PLAN.

362
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,140
THE MARSHALL PLAN.

363
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,280
EVERYONE
KNOWS IT BUT NO ONE IN TV WILL

364
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,530
TALK ABOUT IT, NONE OF THE THINK
TANKS TALK ABOUT IT, NONE OF THE

365
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,340
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT IT.

366
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,180
BUT
THAT'S PART OF WHAT MADE AMERICA

367
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,900
GREAT, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LOVED
US, BECAUSE WE TOOK TWO

368
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,170
COUNTRIES, THE BIGGEST WAR IN
HISTORY, ONE HAD NAZIS, THE

369
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,320
OTHER ONE ATTACKED US IN PEARL
HARBOR, OUR BIGGEST ENEMIES,

370
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,200
SOME OF THE WORST SCOUNDRELS,
MOST EVIL ENEMIES IN THE HISTORY

371
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,310
OF MANKIND, AND WE TURN THEM
INTO OUR TOP ALLIES.

372
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,310
JESUS

373
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,920
CHRIST, THAT IS AMAZING.

374
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,870
IT'S
THE MOST AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT,

375
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,040
I WOULD ARGUE, PERHAPS IN HUMAN
HISTORY.

376
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,570
AND PEOPLE SAY I'M

377
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,130
GETTING TOO JINGOISTIC ABOUT
AMERICA, BUT I BELIEVE IN

378
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,340
AMERICA, I BELIEVE IN THAT IDEA,
I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT.

379
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
BUT IN

380
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,350
ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO
THINK, AND GET BEYOND THE

381
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,619
CORRUPTION, BECAUSE ALL OF THESE
SO-CALLED THINK TANKS AND

382
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,099
POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA ARE
FUNDED BY THE SAME PEOPLE, AND

383
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,389
THEY ARE FUNDED TO CREATE MORE
WAR, MORE CONFLICT, NOT TO SOLVE

384
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,240
THE CONFLICT, AND NOT TO SOLVE
THE WARS.

385
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,490
SO WHEN WE GET BOMBED

386
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,060
BY TERRORISTS, UNFORTUNATELY
THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE, THAT'S NOT

387
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,880
AN OOPS, GOLLY GEE, HOW DID THAT
HAPPEN, IT PERPETUATES THE CYCLE

388
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,890
OF VIOLENCE WHICH MAKES SOME
PEOPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

389
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,890
IT

390
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,280
IS SICK, AND THAT'S HOW IT
HAPPENS, AND IF WE DON'T GET THE

391
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,390
CORRUPTION IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
FOR TIME IMMEMORIAL.

392
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,390
WE HAVE TO

393
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,100
GET TO THE ROOT CAUSE, WE HAVE
TO STOP LETTING MONEY FINANCE

394
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,370
OUR ELECTIONS, IF YOU LET
DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FINANCED

395
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,360
ELECTIONS OF COURSE YOU WILL
HAVE MORE WAR, AND BY THE WAY

396
00:17:55,360 --> 00:00:00,000
MORE TERRORISM, BECAUSE IT HELPS
THEM BRING OUT MORE WAR.
