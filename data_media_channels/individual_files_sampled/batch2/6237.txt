Ford wasn't attractive enough to be Rey but the messaging about women and how they look with regard to their intellect their substance and why they matter it's it continues to feed the problem of why we're treated like second-class citizens and I just think it's it's tiring and it's exhausting and women are such a problem for women right now right and and I think for me the the worst part about all of this look if if you don't think that Kavanagh did it that's one thing but taking the extra step of going after the accusers like some of the stuff that I saw about dr. Blasi Ford I mean yeah I just don't get it right you don't know it whether or not she had this experience right you you're doubting it but you don't know for sure and so what if it did happen and you're going out of your way to smear her to say all these horrible things about her you know it's not easy to come forward in this especially in this political climate yeah and and speak out and challenge someone in a position of power like that I mean it's destroyed her life so like she's already gone through hell in order to do what she sees as their civic duty just let it go like you guys won just let it go like the constant smear campaigns toward her and the other accusers it's insane so there were other tweets that again proved the point right the point that a lot of women are trying to make regarding sexual assault one other person says I see she's wearing her take me seriously halter-top today another person wrote you know she's wearing her f me clothes trying to use sex to sell her twisted toxic feminism I mean this is look I don't like the oh look at what people on Twitter are saying stories but there's a point to this and the point is there's a culture surrounding these allegations and the culture is if you look a certain way if you act a certain way you deserve it and we got to change that culture because the onus is now women the onus is not on men who have been sexually assaulted the onus is on the individuals that the perpetrators right they're the ones who need to be criticized they're the ones who need to be held to account and and unfortunately we're not there yet I really thought that there was progress but no we're not there yet clearly know anything is with Emily and her clothing you know she's being objectified and reduced to that object and so when she speaks out on behalf of feminism it's the thought of what we need to reduce her back to that being that object so we can control her or marginalize her and it's funny because it almost dehumanizes you because uh as they reported in Washington DC was 88 degrees and like crazy humid so what would you wear if you're male or female so part of me is like you're almost taking away her humanity by saying you need to cover up more despite the fact that the environment which are in you would look silly in a trench coat but you're essentially telling her to cover it's all of it is nonsensical but by the lengths that individuals will go male and female as you pointed out it just it's so unfortunate how it continues to reinforce that culture and by the way there's also I think that it's important of course to focus on the Brett Kavanaugh part of this but I think if you look at the broader picture and how our society views issues of sexual assault and rape and how dismissive we are overall you'll you'll see like yeah this was to be expected this outcome I was so naive to think that there would be justice in this outcome but like look at the way we deal with prison rape and rape in our military and I'm talking about scores of men who have been raped and sexually assaulted in our society doesn't care about that in fact they're stigmatized even more because they're men and so marital rape marital rape of course I'm this kind of stuff I mean our lawmakers refused to take up legislation that would actually do something about these situations you know and so how are we going to expect the very same people to go out of their way to protect women who have come forward against a man in a position of power they won't even do it when it comes to allegations against the powerless I felt really bad for her because up when I watched her I'm like she's sitting before a bunch of men who are a reflection of the man who assaulted her or allegedly assaulted her so that had to feel a certain way because you could feel it from them but you know I like I said I'm really tired I'm and I because I can't say those things and I mean I don't apologize and I don't care a lot of the women who are criticizing the girl in her halter top probably wouldn't look good in the halter top which is why you're trying to make her feel bad for it and and yes I said something that ridiculous and ignorant because that's exactly how that sounds but those are the people who are always sending tweets to someone like me saying you saying bad words it's not funny and why are you wearing that you know that puritanical thinking like that everybody everybody adheres to your personal beliefs like how dare you I'm tired of women doing this to other women and the problem is that the chickens always come home to roost so all of you who are basking in this victory will feel the pain of it later I guarantee you so I hope that you gear up for what's to come because when they say women they don't exclude the ones who they think that they think are the ones that are allies they mean all of us two easy ways following Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're
