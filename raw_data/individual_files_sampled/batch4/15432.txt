Sacha Baron Cohen has a new show coming out and based on his previous work I thought it would be another great hit I've really enjoyed some of his other stuff Borat was hilarious Bruno is just fantastic and I'm sure even Ron Paul can laugh when Bruno hit on him in a hotel room has anyone ever told you you look like Enrique Iglesias hmm of course not you're much cuter this is ended that guy's clearer than the blazes he took his clothes off this get going there was even an Ali G interview with Jacob Riis MOG a classy conservative British Member of Parliament who took it all in stride and went along with the comedy would I be upper-class if I got a top hat and wore it well would you like to try I have a top hat I can lend it to the next few minutes of this interview if you'd like dead ringer for Lord snooty this time I think he's taking things too far in preparation for a new show he invited Sarah Palin to be interviewed by a disabled War veteran who she now understands was Cohen in a costume she was told it would be a Showtime historical documentary talking about the history of America the New York Times reports that Palin says she was asked questions that were full of Hollywood isms and disrespect and sarcasm she had enough and physically removed her mic and walked out before she was purposefully taken to the wrong airport and missed her flight home I think this is just too far not just the fact that they took her to the wrong Airport but the fact that he played a disabled War veteran being the class act she always is Palin has called on Cohen to air the interview and donate all the profits to veterans charities but here's the thing given how Cohen has been willing to cross the politically correct line over and over again why isn't he using his genuine comedic talent and taking on some of the lunacy of the left rather than attacking Palin because what he did wasn't funny and sounded can attack to me would it be fair and funnier to start taking on the left it's not the first time he did something like this he tried this with Trump back before it became president Trump's tweets proudly exclaiming he never falls for scams and was the only one to immediately walk out of the Ali G interview is hilarious this just shows Cohen's political bias he's always taking on people on the right but he's never addressed people on the left he's never addressed the crazies on the left and how funny and hypocritical they are it would be a great sight to see it's not just that the left are an easy target but that they are a vocal minority that are purposefully pushing the buttons of regular people we would love to see these far-left lunatics played at their own game they have other kin burries people identify as at least one of these 72 genders and people that literally scream when Trump became president these are the type of people who constantly call Cohen's viewers racist and I know that if he ever took them on the content would be fantastic and Cohen would even reap the benefits he has a comedic gift wouldn't it be amazing if he put it to some good in this political climate when a bitter partisanship and division Cohen has the power to disarm those causing these problems the normal people of America are dying for great comedy content right now we are being forced to settle for comedians like Amy Schumer and Michelle wolf and I just don't know how much more of that we can take if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
