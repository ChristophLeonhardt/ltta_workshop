00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,850
THEY SAY THEY WILL FLY
356,000 KM FOR A 1065 SECONDS.

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,850
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

16

THAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE LINE
OF ATTACK AGAINST GUAM AND

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,309
THEY ARE SAYING THAT THEY WILL
BE DOING IT IN MID AUGUST.

18
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,630
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
DECLARE THIS SPECIFIC A PLAN OF

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,250
ATTACK AGAINST ANOTHER COUNTRY
AND ANNOUNCE IT PUBLICLY.

20

AGAIN, THEY HUFF AND THEY PATH

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,020
LONG TIME IN THE USUALLY DO NOT
ACTUALLY ATTACK PEOPLE.

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,140
THEY WANT TEST MISSILES ALL OF
THE TIME, BUT WE HAVE AN

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,729
EXTRAORDINARY SHOWDOWN HERE AND
I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU

24
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,090

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,200
WE HAVE TO INCREDIBLY ON
PREDICTABLE UNINTELLIGENT

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,159
LEADERS IN NORTH KOREA IN THE US
AND THEY BOTH HAVE INCREDIBLY

27
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,950
FRAGILE EGOS AND THEY KEEP
THREATENING ONE ANOTHER.

28
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,700
TRUMP SAID HE WILL BRING FIRE
AND FURY LIKE NOTICE EVER

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,340
SEEN BEFORE, INDICATING THAT HE
MIGHT USE NUKES AND THEN

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,560
THIS MORNING HE SAID YES,
WELCOME AND SWEETIE

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,301
REFERRED TO HOW WE HAVE NUKES,
THEY HAVE BEEN UPDATED AND

32
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,280
MODERNIZED AND THEY'RE READY TO
GO.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,750
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HE IS
THREATENING NUCLEAR WAR

34
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,950
AGAINST NORTH KOREA.

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,290
NORTH KOREAN RETURN SAID THEY
WOULD HIT GUAM AND THEN

36
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,259
TODAY THIS UPDATE IS, HERE IS
EXACTLY HOW AND WHEN WE ARE

37
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,470
GOING TO HIT GUAM.

38
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,600
UNLESS THERE ARE COOLER HEADS,
AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANY EXIST

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,300
IN THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION
OR THE NORTH KOREAN

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,410
ADMINISTRATION, THE WORLD COULD
BE IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE HERE.

41
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,231
LINDSAY GRAHAM THE REPUBLICAN
SENATOR FROM SOUTH KOREA

42
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:27,510
SOUTH CAROLINA SAID TODAY IF
THEY COME ANYWHERE NEAR GUAM,

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,230
THIS IS NORMAL, IF YOU ATTACK
US, PERCY WILL TAKE YOU BACK NOT

44
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,020
NECESSARILY WITH NUKES, THAT'S
NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT,

45
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,950
BUT HE SAID THEY COME ANYWHERE
NEAR GUAM, WE WILL LAUNCH.

46
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,340
AGAIN, NOT NECESSARILY NUKES,
BUT TRUMP IS SAYING YES, NUKES.

47
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,810
IF THIS GOES FORWARD, AND
APPARENTLY WE'RE ON THE

48
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,670
CLOCK, MID-AUGUST IS NOT THAT
FAR.

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,290
ITíS ABOUT A WEEK AWAY.

50
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,730
WE MIGHT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
USED AGAIN ON EARTH.

51
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,450
THERE IS NO WINNING A NUCLEAR
WAR.

52
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,930
THERE IS ONLY LOSERS.

53
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,280
MILLIONS OF LIVES ARE ON THE
LINE.

54
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,340
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE
AFRAID OF IF DONALD TRUMP

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,600
GOT ELECTED AND RIGHT NOW, HE
HAS BLUNDERED HIS WAY RIGHT

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,040
INTO THE MIDDLE OF A CONFLICT
THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,349
LET'S HOPE THAT IT SOMEHOW
COOLS DOWN, BUT RIGHT NOW IT

58
00:03:16,349 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOKS LIKE A WORLDWIDE DISASTER.
