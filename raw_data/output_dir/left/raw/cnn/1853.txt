1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
it was an iconic moment during the final
minutes of President Obama's time in

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,240
office looking through an oval office
window as he slipped a handwritten

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,160
letter for Donald Trump into the
resolute desk addressed to mr. president

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,199
two days later President Trump spoke
about that letter I just went to the

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:30,199
Oval Office and found this beautiful
letter from President Obama it was

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,200
really very nice of him to do that and
we will cherish that we will keep that

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,930
and we won't even tell the press what's
in that letter president Trump has since

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,850
shown that letter to his White House
visitors and now for the first time CNN

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,129
has an exclusive look at the contents of
that special letter and it reads in full

10
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,920
as following dear mr. president
congratulations on a remarkable run

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,170
millions have placed their hopes in you
and all of us regardless of party should

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,909
hope for expanded prosperity and
security during your tenure this is a

13
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,470
unique office without a clear blueprint
for success so I don't know that any

14
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,909
advice for me will be particularly
helpful still let me offer a few

15
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,200
reflections from the past eight years
first we've both been blessed in

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,840
different ways with good with great good
fortune not everyone is so lucky it is

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,030
up to us to do everything we can to
build more leap more ladders rather of

18
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,530
success for every child and family
that's willing to work hard second

19
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,079
American leadership in this world really
is indispensable it's up to us through

20
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,030
action and example to sustain the
international order that's expanded

21
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,490
steadily since the end of the Cold War
and upon which our own wealth and safety

22
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,950
depend third we are just temporary
occupants of this office that makes us

23
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,479
guardians of those democratic
institutions and traditions like rule of

24
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,619
law separation of powers equal
protection and civil liberties that our

25
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,970
forbearers fought and bled for
regardless of the push and pull of daily

26
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,390
politics it's up to us
to leave those instruments of our

27
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,459
democracy at least as strong as we found
them and finally take time in the rush

28
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,330
of events and responsibilities for
friends and family they'll get you

29
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,290
through the inevitable rough patches
Michelle and I wish you and Melania the

30
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,640
very best as you embark on this great
adventure and know that we stand ready

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:00:00,000
to help in any ways which we can good
luck and Godspeed Bo Barack Obama
