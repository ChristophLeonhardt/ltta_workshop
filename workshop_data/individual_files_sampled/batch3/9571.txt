PLAY HIM BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT, WE'LL HAVE A WAR AND YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE IT. Sandra: CHRIS WALLACE IS THE ANCHOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY". GOOD AFTERNOON FROM WINDSOR. I HAVE TO SAY YOU LOOK SMASHING, I GUESS IS WHAT THE BRITISH WOULD SAY. THAT'S QUITE A BACK DROP BEHIND YOU, SANDRA. Sandra: THAT'S QUITE PROPER OF YOU. YOU ARE ALWAYS A GENTLEMAN, CHRIS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MEANWHILE THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON BACK AT HOME AND BIG DECISIONS THE MAKE WHEN IT COMES TO NORTH KOREA AND STRATEGIZING WHAT TO DO NEXT. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM THERE? WELL LOOK, A LOT OF THIS IS PLAYED OUT ACTUALLY ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY". A FEW WEEKS AGO JOHN BOLTON IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR CAME ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" AND SAID DRAMATIC TERMS AS TO WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP IN GETTING RELIEF FROM ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. HE TALKED ABOUT THE LIBYAN MODEL FROM 2003-2004 AND THAT'S WHEN LIBYAN DICTATOR GADHAFI GAVE UP LIBYA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM FOR RELAXATION IN SANCTIONS. THE NORTH KOREANS READ THAT DIFFERENTLY. LATER ON IN 2011, 2012, THE U.S. AND THE ALLIES MOVED AGAINST GADHAFI AND HE ENDED UP BEING KILLED BY REBELS IN THE STREET. SO IF YOU'RE KIM JONG-UN, THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A VERY GOOD MODEL AND THEY SAID LOOK, THE LAST THING WE WANT IS THE LIBYAN MODEL WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS AT PAINS YESTERDAY TO SAY WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE LIBYAN MODEL WITH JOHN BOLTON STANDING IN HIS SHADOW IN THE OVAL OFFICE. SO BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO HAVE THIS MEETING TODAY. THEY HAVE TO GET ON THE RIGHT PAGE. THREE SENDING MIXED SIGNALS PARTICULARLY SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE SENDING EXACTLY THE RIGHT SIGNAL TO KIM JONG-UN. AS FAR AS WHAT LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID IT IS WHAT MIKE MULLEN SAID ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" LAST WEEK WHICH IS THIS IS VERY HOPEFUL THAT YOU HAVE THE SUMMIT. IF IT FALLS APART, THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE ROOM FOR DIPLOMACY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ISN'T GOING TO FEEL WITHOUT ROOM FOR DIPLOMACY HE HAS TO ENGAGE IN MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST NORTH KOREA TO STOP ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM. SO THAT'S THE HIGH RISK AND HIGH REWARD OF THIS KIM/TRUMP SUMMIT. Sandra: WHAT EXTENT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWING THAT HE IS WILLING TO GO TO MAKE THIS SUMMIT HAPPEN, CHRIS? WELL, HE HAS ACCEPTED THE DEAL AND CLEARLY HE SEEMS INTERESTED. I WAS GOING TO SAY ENAMORED OF THE IDEA HE COULD PULL OFF A DEAL THAT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD THOUGHT WAS UNTHINKABLE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. THE IDEA THAT KIM WOULD GIVE UP HIS ENTIRE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN RETURN FOR RELIEF IN SANCTIONS AND THE PRESIDENT ALSO YESTERDAY SORT OF UPPED THE ANTE IN TERMS OF WHAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE KIM AND BASICALLY SAID SECURITY GUARANTEE THAT THE U.S. WOULD NEVER OR AT LEAST AS LONG AS KIM MINDED HIS MANNERS, KEPT TO HIS WORD, THAT HE WOULD NEVER MOVE AGAINST THE KIM REGIME. SO HE IS WILLING TO DO A LOT BUT HAVING SEEN HOW KIM AND HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER WENT BACK ON THEIR WORD IN PREVIOUS CASES, CLEARLY HE WANTS CLEAR ASSURANCES AND PROOF AND A WAY TO VERIFY THAT KIM IS GIVING UP HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND HIS MISSILE PROGRAM BEFORE HE IS WILLING TO MAKE ANY PROMISES OF SECURITY OR ECONOMIC RELIEF. Sandra: WE ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO YOU MAKING NEWS ON "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" ON THE WEEKENDS. WHO DO YOU HAVE AS A GUEST THIS WEEKEND? LINDSEY GRAHAM, I HAVE TO SAY MY COLLEAGUE MARTHA MACCALLUM GOT A LOT OUT OF THE SENATOR. HE IS ALWAYS INTERESTING AND INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROMISE IN THE OVAL OFFICE TO SAY IF KIM MAKES A DEAL NORTH KOREA WILL BE A PROSPEROUS COUNTRY. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS TO GRAHAM ARE WE GIVING UP TOO MUCH IN RETURN FOR WHAT NORTH KOREA MIGHT PROMISE TO DO? Sandra: MARK YOUR CALENDARS. FIRST WATCH SHEP, AINSLEY AND I COVERING THE ROYAL WEDDING TOMORROW AND TUNE IN FOR "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" ON SUNDAY. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU. ARE YOU GOING TO WEAR ONE OF THOSE SILLY FASCINATEOR HATS TOMORROW? Sandra: YOU'LL HAVE TOO TUNE IN TO FIND OUT. SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK I SHOULD. WE'LL SEE WHAT SHEP IS WEARING, RIGHT? I WOULD PAY MONEY FOR SHEP
