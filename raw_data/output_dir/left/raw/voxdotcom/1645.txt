00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,770
This winter, there's good news for drivers.
Gas prices are cheaper than they've been in

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,390
years. But it wasn't so long ago that people
were complaining about high prices. So what

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,590
happened? The first thing to know is that
gasoline prices are largely driven by oil

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,060
prices, and those oil prices are set in a
global market, and largely determined by the

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,660
supply and demand of oil. The countries that
produce the most oil right now are Saudi Arabia,

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,720
Russia, and the United States. Saudi Arabia
is part of an organization called OPEC. In

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,229
the past, OPEC has often tried to coordinate
its production in order to try to get the

8
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:42,589
price it prefers. On the other side, the biggest
consumers of oil are the U.S., China and Japan.

9
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:47,799
Starting in the 2000s, oil prices began rising
rapidly. That was because China was growing

10
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:53,549
fast and oil production wasn't keeping up.
This led to a huge spike in prices and a lot

11
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:59,039
of talk about peak oil. But those higher prices
also made it profitable for the U.S. and Canada

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,530
to start going after harder-to-extract oil
in shale formations and tar sands. That led

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,980
to a rise in supply. By 2014, that extra supply,
combined with a slowdown in demand in Europe

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,230
and Asia all came together to create a price
crash. And that's better news for some than

15
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:22,080
others. In Russia and some OPEC countries,
low oil prices threaten their national budgets.

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,020
OPEC could try to cut production to try to
prop up the price of oil, but they haven't

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,780
done that this time. They're hoping that low
prices will make some of the newest U.S. producers

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,030
unprofitable. In the meantime, American consumers
are getting a big break. If gas stays under

19
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,720
$2.80/gallon, families could save $700 over
a year, by one estimate. That would boost

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,280
the economy. In recent years, the U.S. has
been using less and less oil because people

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,230
are buying more fuel-efficient cars. But when
gas prices go back down, we do the reverse

22
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,190
and start buying more gas guzzlers and SUVs.
So when buying a vehicle, keep in mind that

23
00:01:57,190 --> 00:00:00,000
a car can last 10 years or more, but if history
is any guide, low oil prices won't last that long.
