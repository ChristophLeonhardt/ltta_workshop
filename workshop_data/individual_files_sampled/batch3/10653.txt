America's national security agency has the power to identify people by the sound of their voice they are thought to be using technology much more advanced than that of Apple or Amazon that's according to a report based on documents leaked by the agency's former contractor Edward Snowden Jacqueline Ruger picks up the story based on my voice there isn't much you can gather about my identity sure you can tell them female and based on my accent you can assume that I'm American and that's more or less the NSA however could do a lot more easily using my voice to identify Who I am what language I'm speaking my gender and my dialect according to classified documents from the Snowden archive the NSA has been developing technology to identify a speaker using just their voice for years when SIGINT transcribers worked the same target set for a long time they sometimes can identify a certain individual in recorded conversations just by the sound of his voice and by his unique way of speaking this process was traditionally known as voice identification now rapidly improving technology is available that can do the same job of mathematically the technology works by analyzing your voices unique features to create an individual voice print and once the NSA has that a single speaker can be almost instantaneously pinpointed even among massive databases now in 2016 alone the NSA hoarded more than 151 million records of Americans phone calls and that was after their bulk collection abilities were limited by Congress so there's no telling how many voice prints they could have at their disposal and theoretically a person could be instantly located and tracked down as long as a microphone is somewhere nearby and as Edward Snowden pointed out there's almost no escaping mics these days I don't think anybody would argue that the police should catch they'd chase terrorists or pedophiles but we're not talking about just just targeted surveillance what we're talking about is everybody everything a piece of data by everybody being collected and scanned by software for anything that looks deviant they could start targeting people involved in very legitimate things like demonstration strikes even people who vote for the wrong way as far as the American government is concerned another fear is that speaker recognition could end up discouraging people from speaking out it has the potential to unmask anonymous sources or track journalists or whistleblowers and according to the intercept this technology isn't only in American hands either it looks like Interpol the European Union and China have their own version as well among others so you can run but you definitely cannot hide and from collecting information and to losing it the US federal court has revealed the NSA deleted crucial data connected to illegal wiretapping carried out by the George W Bush administration the agency responded saying the data was removed to simply free up space on its hard drives the presidential surveillance program internet content data makes criteria that were broadly used to delete dates of a certain type in response to mission requirements to free up space and improve performance of the backup system the data in question was controversially collected after the 9/11 terror attacks in the u.s. in 2007 it was initially ordered by the court to be preserved for further examination but has now been erased along with the backup tapes the information was deemed important to a number of pending lawsuits a former NSA director and whistleblower we spoke to says this sort of data tends to disappear far too often it's a way of covering your backside so that when the investigations started and they get there they just can't let that data be exposed that's all it's just more evidence of their criminal activity the Department of Defense Inspector General did the same thing with the material against whistleblowers even when the whistleblowers were in a court under under criminal accusation in a criminal trial they destroyed evidence and it was only because it was exculpatory and they didn't want that out so now this is all deliberate even when they lie in front of Congress or to the people the United States or even to the President or any of the cabinet heads it doesn't seem to matter if there's no accountability here the intelligence community has so much power I mean even Senator Schumer told the president Trump that he shouldn't be attacking the intelligence community because they've got six ways to Sunday to get back at you and these are the ways they do it
