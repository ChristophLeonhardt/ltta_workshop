Hungary is making a stand against a new report that claims the country has breached the key values of the block it's launched a campaign video to counter the claims as a rule by Parliament Bevin - party - Peggy Ellicott hogatha mingott Mercure de ja vu Kazan cottage Aruba Nang get in cause you're alive stop V Duke met Maharaja key suit mother or Sakura Manya make visible the move comes after the EU officially accepted the findings of the sergeant Eenie report which cites a number of alleged violations by Hungary they do include migrant abuse corruption and attacks on press freedoms and also the democratic process and it means that the EU may now invoke article 7 which can suspend certain rights of member states including voting rights article 7 though has so far never been used but tensions of late have been ramping up sadly the Commission shares the concerns expressed in the report in particular as regards fundamental rights corruption the treatment of Roma and the Independence of the judiciary individuals in the government have enriched themselves their family members their friends from public funding from European taxpayers money the elections this year were held in an atmosphere of aggression and intimidation already made up your mind I stand here to defend my country and this is a matter of Honor this insults the honour of Hungary this uses double standards and violates the treaties it says it upholds well earlier I spoke to the Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltan Kovach about the campaign and the reasons why Hungary has become the you use target this is not a legal process this is a political process initiated by the political and the Liberals in the European Parliament head of the European Parliament elections next May for the past eight years increasingly especially if it's about Hungary but they also Poland and others in central Eastern Europe the European political left and liberals have started to use human rights issues rule of law corruption as a scarlet letter that is put on us and is trying to put us into a corner from which we have to defend ourselves and we don't believe in that this is political blackmailing it's a witch-hunt using the kind of arguments and accusations against which it's very difficult actually to put up any kind of deeper so that's why we are not defending ourselves but rather we go on and charge and that is we stand for our own version and reading what is happening in Europe with a special emphasis as I mentioned on the legal migration what we've seen for the past three years but it's happening for the past maybe two decades by now business model at the borders of Europe where human traffickers and human rights organizations who are helping illegal migrants reaching the European continent and with in depth new the European Union basically going against the existing legal system the legal framework in which the European Union should exist and they utilize or rather misuse the existing loopholes in the legal system so what we do here in Hungary that step-by-step reacting on reality on the ground we are closing those loopholes and indeed 1/3 measure actually it would be if someone an individual is working together with human traffickers explicitly and openly is helping illegal migrants to cross the border against the existing rules the European rules and the Hungarian rules that might be sanctioned at the highest level but in general our intention is to put things back on their feet and that is restore law and order at the borders of Europe we are not going to leave neither the European People's Party nor the European for obvious reasons we belong we are Europe and we are the People's Party leaders behind the Hungarian government is probably the strongest political party with the most support coming from the people over 50% during the past consecutive European parliamentary elections so that would be absurd to vindicate that we have no place in the European People's Party or in Europe we go for changing the rules and we go for reinstating what the original meaning of Europe is instead of leading to your pain you
