KOREA HAVE NOT HAPPENED
LEADING UP TO THE SUMMIT.
NEIL?
>> Neil: SOMETHING HAPPENED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS
BUDDY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
RICH EDSON AT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT.
COULD IT BE AS SIMPLE AS A
CASE OF COLD FEET AND NORTH
KOREANS GETTING NERVOUS
ABOUT GIVING AWAY SO MUCH SO
EARLY OR THE GLOBAL
PERCEPTION THAT THEY'RE.
WHO BETTER THAN TO GET A
READ OF THIS THAN A WOMAN
WHO WILL BE VISITING THE
COUNTRY AGAIN ARIZONA
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN
KELLY McSALLY.
CONGRESSWOMAN, GOOD TO HAVE
YOU ON.
>> GOOD TO BE ON, NEIL,
THANKS.
I'M GOING THERE NEXT WEEKEND
LEADING A CONGRESSIONAL
DELEGATES.
>> Neil: BE SAVE.
>> I WILL.
>> Neil: WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE.
>> HARD TO TELL.
COULD BE JUST SOME POSTURING
AND TRYING TO SHOW STRENGTH
COMING UP TO THE SUMMIT.
BUT WE HAVE ALSO SEEN IN THE
PAST 1992 AND 2000 AND 2007,
WHERE THEY HAD A LOT OF NICE
WORDS ABOUT MOVING TOWARDS
MORE OF A PEACE AND THEN IT
ENDED UP BEING NOTHING AND
THEY BACKTRACKED THEIR
NORMAL OPPRESSIVE REGIME.
>> Neil: THEY HAVE A HISTORY
OF LYING.
>> THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF
LYING.
TRUST BUT VERIFY DISTRUST
BUT VERIFY.
HISTORIC OPENING WE HAVEN'T
SEEN THANKS TO THE MAXIMUM
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN BY THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
THE HARD WORK IS IN FRONT OF
US.
CAPABILITY, YOU KNOW, THREAT
EQUALS CAPABILITY PLUS
INTENT.
RIGHT NOW CAPABILITIES ARE
STILL THERE.
AS WAS JUST POINTED OUT.
THE WORDS HAVE CHANGED A
LITTLE BIT.
BUT THE HARD WORK WITH
REALLY IN THE FRONT.
>> Neil: IF KIM JONG UN IS
SAYING I HAVE NO INTERESTED
IN MEETING WITH MY SOUTH
KOREAN COUNTER PART, DO WE
STILL GO TO OUR WEDDING?
>> I THINK THERE IS STILL A
LOT OF DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS
GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES
IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR
THIS.
SO LET'S SEE HOW THE NEXT
DAYS UNFOLD.
THEY HAVE ONGOING EXERCISE
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE
UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH.
THEY HAVE AIR FORCE
EXERCISE.
>> Neil: YOU MEAN OUR JOINT
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH THE
SOUTH KOREANS?
>> YES.
>> Neil: ANYTHING THAT WE
HAVE BEEN DOING DIFFERENT
DELAY WOULD HAVE PROMPTED
THIS?
>> NO.
WE, IN FACT, DELAYED THE
INITIAL EXERCISE UNTIL AFTER
THE OLYMPICS, YOU KNOW, IN A
GOODWILL.
THEY KNEW IT WAS COMING.
>> Neil: DID WE TELL THEM IT
WAS COMING.
>> YES.
>> Neil: MISCOMMUNICATED OR
DIDN'T SEE COMING.
>> THE AIR FORCE EXERCISES
STARTED YESTERDAY.
AND THEY GO UNTIL THE 25TH.
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A
SHIFT OF A NEW EXERCISE THAT
STARTED.
>> Neil: WE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY
MORE PROVOCATIVE.
>> NOT AT ALL.
THESE EXERCISES ARE YEARLY.
SOUTH KOREAN COUNTERPARTS
MAKE SURE WE ARE READY TO
GO.
COMMAND AND CONTROL.
THIS IS WHAT WE DO ALL THE
TIME AND WE SHOULDN'T STOP
THEM.
IF THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TO
US STOP THESE EXERCISES AND
THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE
THING THAT WOULD BE
DANGEROUS.
I WOULD NOT ADVISE THAT.
>> Neil: YOU WOULDN'T ADVISE
THAT WE CHANGE NOT STOP THE
EXERCISES BUT EITHER, I
DON'T KNOW, DON'T MAKE THEM
AS DRAMATIC.
>> NO WAY.
STAY THE COURSE NOW.
KEEP UP THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE
CAMPAIGN.
WE HAVE A DIPLOMATIC OPENING
FOR SURE.
BUT, THE VICE SCRIPTS NEED
TO KEEP BEING VERY STRONG
UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE
THEIR BEHAVIOR THAT THEY
WOULD ALLOW A FULL
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
PENINSULA VERIFIABLE.
>> Neil: THE MEETING ON
JUNE 129 CHANGING BEHAVIOR
THEN.
>> SECRETARY POMPEO BEEN
OVER THERE A COUPLE TIMES
NOW AND DOING A LOT OF
GROUND WORK BEHIND THE
SCENES IN ORDER TO PREPARE
FOR THAT MEETING ON
JUNE 12TH.
SO, AGAIN, THIS IS A LONG
TIME BETWEEN NOW AND
JUNE 129.
AND A LOT OF THINGS CAN
HAPPEN DIPLOMATICALLY AND
THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO
MAKE THE DECISION.
WE ALWAYS HAD TO BE READY TO
WALK AWAIT A MINUTE
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID
THAT MANY TIMES.
THIS IS HIS.
>> Neil: AHEAD OF THE
MEETING.
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK THE
CHINESE IS PLAYING ANY ROLE
OR PRESSURE IN NORTH KOREA
THAT KIM JONG UN IS GIVING
THE IMPRESSION WE'RE GIVING
THE STORE AWAY BEFORE EVEN
SITTING DOWN?
>> I THINK HE CERTAINLY
NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO SHOW
STRENGTH IN HIS OWN INTERNAL
POLITICS AND OWN REGIME
DYNAMICS GOING ON.
IT'S HARD TO TELL.
>> Neil: OVERTURES MADE
COULDN'T MAKE THEM IN A
VACUUM.
>> RIGHT.
>> Neil: PERCEPTION BETWEEN
THE POLICE OR THE HOSTAGES.
BETWEEN THE DENUCLEARIZATION
COMMISSION.
>> SHOWING WEAKNESS,
ESSENTIALLY.
AND, AGAIN, THAT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I CAN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING
ABOUT INTERNALLY.
SO, HE IS TRYING TO, I
THINK, SHOW UP TO THE
NEGOTIATIONS POTENTIALLY
WITH GREATER STRENGTH
INSTEAD OF WEAKNESS.
>> Neil: NOTHING HAS BEEN
CANCELLED.
>> I'M STILL HEADING OVER
THERE WE'RE NOT GOING NORTH.
WE'RE GOING.
>> Neil: WORRIED THAT ALL OF
THE SUDDEN THE NORTH DOESN'T
WANT TO MEET WITH.
THEY WOULD YOUR MEETING BE
POINTLESS?
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GET ON
THE GROUND WITH THIS
DELEGATES, TALK TO THE
TROOPS, TALK TO THE EMBASSY,
SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY
HAPPENING REALTIME AND GET A
REAL SENSE FIRSTHAND.
>> Neil: HAVE THEY TALKED TO
YOU, CONGRESSWOMAN TO SAY WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP?
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
BOWER PLANS FOR OUR TRIP BUT
WE'LL SEE WHEN WE GET ON THE
GROUND.
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT, OF COURSE,
HAS BEEN STATE DEPARTMENT
WE'RE STILL GOING.
>> I THINK RIGHT NOW, AGAIN,
THIS IS JUST NEW NECESSARY.
WE NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE DAYS AHEAD.
I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO
CONTINUE TO PLAN TOWARDS
JUNE 12TH.
BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
WILLING TO WALK AWAY.
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.
WE ARE NOT GIVING AWAY THE
FARM.
WE HAVE VERY CLEAR
OBJECTIVES OF MAKING SURE NO
AMERICAN CITY IS GOING TO BE
HELD HOSTAGE BY A NUCLEAR
WEAPON WITH NORTH KOREA.
WE WILL USE ALL ELEMENTS OF
NATIONAL POWER, ECONOMIC,
DIPLOMAT I
DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY IF.
WE WILL SEE WHAT PATH HE
CHOOSES TO TAKE.
>> Neil: A BULLETIN COMING
IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS
LOOKING AT EFFORTS TO
SALVAGE THE IRAN DEAL
FOLLOWING OUR WITHDRAWAL.
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY HAVE
NOT JOINED US.
THAT IS ENGLAND, FRANCE,
GERMANY DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA.
BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO
SALVAGE IT.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT
MEANS.
IT'S A CRAPPY WE HAVE SAID
THAT ALL ALONG.
THEY HAVE HAD 16 MONTHS TO
ADDRESS THESE VERY REAL SUN
SET LAWS THEY HAVE A PATH TO
A BOMB IT DOESN'T ADDRESS
THEIR BALLISTIC MISSILE
DEVELOPMENT AND DOESN'T
ADDRESS ALL THEIR MALIGNED
ACTIVITIES AND STATE SPONSOR
OF TERROR.
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE
CAUSING IRAN WHETHER IT'S IN
YEMEN OR SYRIA OR ATTACKING
ISRAEL, THIS IS ALL BECAUSE
OF INFLUX OF CASH THAT THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ALLOWED
FOR THEM.
THE EUROPEANS HAVE TO DECIDE
WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE
WITH US AND STABILIZATION OR
LOOKING THROUGH GREEN
GLASSES ONLY ABOUT DOING
BUSINESS WITH IRAN.
THEY HAVE SOME TOUGH
