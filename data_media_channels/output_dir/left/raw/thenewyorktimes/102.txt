00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,073
[dramatic music]

2
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:05,070
This is Australia — 
beautiful, majestic,

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,210
with its gorgeous
beaches, lush rain forest,

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,495
stunning deserts,
and snow fields.

5
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:12,560
I know what you’re thinking —

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,780
we’ve got all
those in America.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,810
That’s true.

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,900
But in our ones,
you won’t get shot.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,880
Australia only recently
became a not-getting-shot

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,990
destination.

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,000
For years we had relaxed
gun control and heaps

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,927
of mass shootings.

13
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,760
So it wasn’t really
worth visiting Australia

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,590
because it was pretty
much the same as the U.S.

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,860
But after the ’96
Port Arthur Massacre,

16
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,280
when 35 people died, Australia
saw a tourism opportunity

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,750
in people not dying.

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,370
So they brought in
tighter gun control

19
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,930
and banned
semiautomatic weapons

20
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,240
instead of just thinking
and praying a lot.

21
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,280
Not getting shot really
adds to the magic

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,530
of visiting Australia.

23
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,550
So you can come to places
like this and still be alive.

24
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,580
I’m not getting shot —

25
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,830
not getting shot here.

26
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,770
In America, there’s more
than 300 million guns.

27
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,900
That’s roughly one
for every person.

28
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,500
But here, I’m
not getting shot.

29
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,280
Not a sniper in
sight — no one’s

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,742
shooting at me here,
or here.

31
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,820
Come cuddle this little
fella without the risk

32
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,050
of getting shot.

33
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,730
It’s not just
about the sights.

34
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,620
It’s about the culture.

35
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,570
We’ve got Australian cinema.

36
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,355
What was your favorite part?

37
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:24,313
Definitely not getting shot.

38
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:25,180
[bell chimes]

39
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,320
In your United
States, on average

40
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,880
there’s a mass shooting
nine out of every 10 days.

41
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,870
But here in Australia,
we just go to the beach

42
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,250
without getting shot.

43
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,570
And if you love
Australia, it’s

44
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,910
a great place to
raise your kids, who

45
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,350
can graduate from school
without getting killed.

46
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,250
So come to beautiful
Australia

47
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,110
and don’t get shot.

48
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,025
[gunshot]

49
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:48,525
“Ah!"

50
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,000
You tell them about all the
animals that’ll kill them?

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[Expletive] no.
