President Trump has signed a bipartisan right to try bill into law that will give dying patients the chance to try experimental drugs that haven't been approved by the FDA but fair on the other side of this is it also allows the pharmaceutical industry to make most consumers into guinea pigs that's this is this is the threshold this is what we've always been waiting for in this it is the pharmaceutical industry has gotten more and more powerful this is like the big drop and and what I mean here is in the past we've always we've always joked are really kidded ourselves into believing that the FDA was there to protect us so the FDA I got to tell you you know how many these national pharmaceutical cases I've handled I can't even count them there's been so many projects that I've handled with the pharmaceutical industry every time we've looked at it it has been the FDA doing a dysfunctional job where it comes to looking out for the consumers here it's even worse because right now this law gives a pharmaceutical company a company a chance to bypass the regular experimental process we go right into clinicals where we're actually using human beings as guinea pigs because we're saying we're gonna save your life you know what the the problem is the expansion of that obviously somebody who's dying they have no other chances this is not a bad idea the problem it develops when we when we take the next step what what how did you read this what's your take on it it's interesting because this is one of those things that it looks great on paper because yes if somebody is dying they have no other options and pharmaceutical comes up says hey you want to try this it may work it may not but what do you have to lose basically so yes it seems like that would be a good idea but there is such a slippery slope and this pushes this right up to that very thin line because at the same time it may save their life it may cure whatever is killing them it could also cause ten different other things that will also well it's yeah it's it's it is really nothing less than saying look you don't have any choice so we're gonna use you as a human guinea pig you may only have a year left but if you take this medication you need to know this can happen this can happen in this can happen they don't even know what's gonna happen you understand what I'm saying at this point they're saying that that individual who opts to do this they don't even know what to tell them might happen because they're actually experimenting in real-time with that human being that's what this is about well this is just just allows the drug industry now the other part of it is they get to do they get to do take a look at other uses for the drug right you see what I'm saying they may say we're treating this for can't you're taking this for cancer all of a sudden they they're finding that they can also use the drug for over uses other uses the patient doesn't know that the patient says look I just want to I just want to be cured this is a pretty ugly story well and and when you also think about it too this is a great way for Big Pharma they don't have to spend as much on research and development right they can go out and actually openly actively solicit anyone that is you know suffering from any kind of terminal disease and say hey we've got this hugely experimental lung cancer drug yeah you're gonna die in the next six months anyway so why don't you just take this you might die suffering more yeah you might die because we don't know exactly what will cause your death you might die in oh by the way back in the office back in the headquarters they're saying you know we ran this we ran this experiment because it's human experiment is what it is we ran this experiment on this person and you know what we found we found it did it did something to improve this and then they take that drug and they use it for something totally different you know it's it in if it wasn't a situation where the FDA was already so dysfunctional I wouldn't I don't think my reaction would be quite so bad but I know how this functional they are they're they're basically useless as well then when you think about it to suppose they give a dying patient this medication and it actually does save them what's going to happen now because FDA is dysfunctional they may go ahead and put them on a fast-track approval not require you know as extraneous testing as they may have because hey it worked in the field on a human being but again that can also as we've seen that can be the fluke right know the side effects may be the real thing that happens the curing that one person might be the flu right and so it's a dangerous thing all around but again on paper it looks great it looks like you're giving patients a possibility of living but it's a huge giveaway that they should call this the the human guinea pig law because that's totally what it is the lawsuits against Harvey Weinstein have taken an interesting turn and now they involve RICO claims against the people and the groups and the companies that help cover up abuse for a long long time and if you look at if you look at this lawsuit you know I I'm very familiar with a law firm that brought this this we've worked with them on good many projects over the years they've worked on the same projects that we have this is a serious firm and this is a serious lawsuit they're actually alleging a RICO case they're they're saying that what's happening here is is racketeering and they're tying those elements of racketeering into everything that Walt Disney Company for example II they're saying look you had you knew what was going on you participated that Miramax participated in that you weren't living in a cave you clearly understood what was going on or how about the the board of directors for Weinstein's Board of Directors or how about just the the agents and the people who knew exactly what was happening this is a really smart lawsuit because what it does is it brings in everybody it holds everybody responsible here okay in it and let them sort it out you know let them get in a room and say I and do this let them sort it out and that's the that's the wisdom of this kind of case what do you think well you know it Weinstein to me is almost like a termite you know yes it's very bad very dangerous did some horrible things but you have to take out the whole colony you can't just squish that one termite and think you solved your problem and that is exactly what happened here it's what we saw at USC it's what we saw at Penn State there was cover-up at every level you can't operate and and harass or assault as many women as Weinstein is accused of doing without other people know yeah the Southern Cal cases you know we're we're working on that case and it's the same kind of deal the Southern Cal even took place after there had already been the Cosby case after there had been the Weinstein case after they've been dozens of cases where we saw that the institution itself was was compart of the program they actually helped promote the program Penn State great example I mean you know the this where the institution is involved and so the the Southern Cal case we're going to find the institution was very very involved because they were they were already on notice that there was a problem here and did nothing these folks when you look at when you look at the producers when you look at the agents when you look at this list of people who had every reason to know what Weinstein was doing but they were so terrified that they were going to lose money
