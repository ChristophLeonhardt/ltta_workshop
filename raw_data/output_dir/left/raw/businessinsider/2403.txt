00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
I'm Henry Blodgett back with the daily

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,529
news analysis let's start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple</font>

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,130
absolute blowout earnings last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night</font>

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,710
what's going forward what happens

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,610
actually we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,320
where that came from first you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,000
mac business which is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,770
sleeper business but incredibly

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,109
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple is starting to really</font>

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,119
reinvigorate itself this was by far the

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,310
biggest quarter they've ever had right

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,849
now as we shoot this<font color="#CCCCCC"> video I the iTunes</font>

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,890
Store is actually down or the apple site

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,750
is down<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they are restocking with</font>

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,759
new max this is obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help</font>

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,829
but if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trends in the</font>

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,260
computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry right now Microsoft's</font>

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-year lock on the Windows</font>

19
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,100
operating system and the desktop is

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,989
starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break apart this has really</font>

21
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,059
created an opening for Apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Mac</font>

22
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,530
business and they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> running through it</font>

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,420
quickly they're gaining share incredibly

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,579
rapidly but they still have<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a tiny</font>

25
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,340
slice<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the computer market so if you</font>

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,840
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about where they can go from there</font>

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,960
eight percent or nine percent share to

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">40-50 something like that there's a huge</font>

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,859
runway obviously the iphone business is

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,680
just cranking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have several more</font>

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,770
new carriers coming on new countries in

32
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,150
this quarter they are definitely

33
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,030
becoming the<font color="#E5E5E5"> de facto platform for</font>

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,490
development<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mobile devices so as far</font>

35
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we're concerned the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only route for</font>

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple right now is up we have the</font>

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,670
housing bubble back take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,140
slide show that Joe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wiesenthal put</font>

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,759
together what were the ingredients of

40
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,140
the housing bubble to begin with well

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,670
first the government gave away free

42
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,320
money and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the government</font>

43
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,909
this time as opposed to private mortgage

44
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,280
lenders<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they are subsidizing once</font>

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,110
again one hundred percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prices</font>

46
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">for houses for people who should never</font>

47
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,060
buy houses you have now bidding<font color="#E5E5E5"> wars</font>

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,340
breaking out in Las Vegas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and elsewhere</font>

49
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,409
you have a whole group of investors

50
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,299
panicked that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to miss the</font>

51
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,520
turn and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into late so they are</font>

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,710
shoveling cash at people who buy up

53
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,930
houses at foreclosure so in a lot of

54
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,610
markets we don't have the soaring prices

55
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,159
yet but we've got all the hallmarks of a

56
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,340
frenzy this is would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly unusual</font>

57
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,040
if in fact the bubble ends this way with

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,229
another bubble so we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very skeptical</font>

59
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,520
in fact we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much more likely</font>

60
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,690
that we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into another year of damn</font>

61
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,670
turn here a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these folks who are</font>

62
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,500
jumping in<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are way too early this is</font>

63
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,190
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not usually the way you end the</font>

64
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,660
aftermath of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile like the one we've</font>

65
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,990
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> stoned was the word used to describe</font>

66
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,940
the new york<font color="#E5E5E5"> times newsroom yesterday</font>

67
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,560
when another hundred layoffs were

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,840
announced last time we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font>

69
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,120
layoffs as we recall<font color="#CCCCCC"> the promise was</font>

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
that would be it there was the brief

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,170
salary reduction earlier this year but

72
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,990
now in fact they're more layoffs if we

73
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,360
look forward with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in new york times we</font>

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,650
think certainly if the economy comes

75
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,690
back there will be a cyclical<font color="#E5E5E5"> lift here</font>

76
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,210
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term it's just hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how</font>

77
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,610
this business survives without a radical

78
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,660
restructuring we think that

79
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,700
restructuring ultimately will lead to at

80
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,450
least half of the jobs in the newsroom

81
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,130
ultimately being eliminated so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

82
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's death by a thousand cuts</font>

83
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,310
unfortunately this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second one in</font>

84
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">recent years and we think probably there</font>

85
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,700
will be more to come although it does

86
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,290
seem like management<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being proactive</font>

87
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,150
about it and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting until they have</font>

88
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,550
a gun at their head so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's positive</font>

89
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,950
the good news<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one out of ten</font>

90
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,290
magazines<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually grew their</font>

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 out of the 250 magazines out</font>

year we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a slide show taking a look</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what you'll notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that most</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those magazines are not news magazines</font>

but they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely growing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news the stock market is more</font>

101
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,640
overbought than at any time in history

102

104
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a date in November of 1980 which we</font>

107

is sort of a fuzzy term but anyway mr.

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,030
about inflation what we're seeing is

113
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,070
deflation producer prices this morning

114
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,650
dropped an unexpected amount so yes

115
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,780
there is this possibility in fact

116
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,670
probably likelihood that once the

117
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,650
economy really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does get roaring again</font>

to see them start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put some of these</font>

reserves in play and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could get</font>

rampant inflation but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

go for an awfully long<font color="#E5E5E5"> period in this</font>

126
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
time where you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restock the</font>

economy and you're in a deflationary

environment before you actually become

129
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,670
inflationary so let's hope it doesn't

130

<font color="#CCCCCC">take as long as japan but right now the</font>

problem is deflation virtual good sales

132

supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> double this year so there is</font>

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the economy that's growing</font>

and then lastly<font color="#CCCCCC"> yahoo is very sorry that</font>

135
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,980
it hired lap dancers to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> convince</font>
