00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,039
it's now been two years since i started

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,440
youtube and what I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,189
quickly it's gone looking back I've seen

4
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,930
lots of phases where particular forms of

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,460
progression have happened and how I've

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,070
developed as a person how I've developed

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,650
a creating videos and just how my life

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,960
is developed overwrought when it's been

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,910
incredible now when most people get to

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,530
an anniversary they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,540
highlights but as you probably aware

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,420
I've killed that to death pretty much

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,089
five times<font color="#E5E5E5"> over so I thought I'd do</font>

14
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,620
something else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two per</font>

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,629
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to everyone who is watching</font>

16
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:47,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video now and that question is why</font>

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,809
do you watch my<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos now there are</font>

18
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,579
many elements this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that I do</font>

19
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,559
a wide range of videos or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">serious on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their entertaining and some</font>

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,750
people say to me oh I didn't subscribe

22
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,519
to you for this reason and some people

23
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,190
like the variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when I place</font>

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,539
this question out there if you could

25
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:07,910
just write a paragraph to describe in

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,640
detail why you do watch my videos why do

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,009
you watch me or even do a video response

28
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,200
and I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really interested to hear</font>

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,679
people's use now this can be positive

30
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you enjoy fine if I um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be inspired maybe</font>

31
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,590
it's helped you through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation I've</font>

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,179
had many emails in the past where people

33
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:32,300
have got through problems and it's great

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a medium in which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can</font>

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,080
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the masses but if you could</font>

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,910
post a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know so other</font>

37
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,940
people can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that be great but I</font>

38
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,009
don't want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come across as a way</font>

39
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,130
for me to boost<font color="#E5E5E5"> my ego because if you</font>

40
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,840
want to truly develop as a person it's

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,640
good to tackle the negative effects

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,700
so the other side of it is doing if you

43
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,770
watch my<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos but have had negative</font>

44
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,290
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that occur because of it do some</font>

45
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them make you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel uncomfortable do</font>

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,210
some of them you disagree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with strongly</font>

47
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,450
and so do any of them cause a negative

48
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,369
effect or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> some aspects of my</font>

49
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,619
videos are neutral and it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great to</font>

50
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">see your thoughts and by all means</font>

51
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">discuss it with other people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font>

52
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,980
find that you may make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a friend or two</font>

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,750
of other people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are within this</font>

54
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,400
collection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who watch my videos</font>

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,650
I spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time when I get the</font>

56
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,270
chance to chat with people who are

57

watching my<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos reach the stickam</font>

58
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,709
live chattering through emails and free

59
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,140
comments and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting how a lot</font>

60
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,120
of people chat just me but they don't

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,040
chance the people next to it may place

62
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,920
the comment or a chat in the library so

63
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,870
this may be a chance to get together and

64
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">you may make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some new friends I think</font>
