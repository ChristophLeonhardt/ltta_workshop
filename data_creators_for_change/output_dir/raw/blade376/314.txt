00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,480
hi it's miles blade 376 house again I'm

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,560
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about serious issue today</font>

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,740
actually and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something which I</font>

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really know it's come over the</font>

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,219
past month that's really reflect on it I

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,470
guess I've always had it but it's become

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,119
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious recently and therefore urge</font>

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,130
for I'd bring out and unlike other

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to reflect on the same issue and</font>

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,560
hopefully come to their own conclusions

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,250
and I guess this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something which</font>

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,869
requires a lot of video responses

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,789
because you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing just to</font>

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,470
post comment admit insane but I want

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to post a video look</font>

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,450
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the camera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say this is what I</font>

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,690
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> about myself to this issue so I</font>

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,680
explain first no one's perfect and we

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,850
all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we all have</font>

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:54,329
insecurities and we all have things that

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,059
we don't like about ourselves now i'm

22
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,219
not talking about looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not talking</font>

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,280
about you know particular aspects like I

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way my hair is or my nose</font>

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,170
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller or something like this</font>

26
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,330
I'm talking about character stuff that

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,770
you can't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's who you</font>

28
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,110
are but you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you think you</font>

29
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that they it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to explain it's not it's not saying</font>

31
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,710
you hate yourself but you know you can

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,020
accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,570
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that takes a brave person to do it</font>

34
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">no mind I don't think is that brave</font>

35
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,380
because well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just me some people</font>

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,159
may think it is now since I've been on

37
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,869
doing video vlog in you learn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

38
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,270
about yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you expose yourself</font>

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,159
out there if you're if you're going to

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,380
be a true person<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I'm sorry spills</font>

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,570
more higher on the internet because I've

42
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,340
always done that in person and people

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to get free well people always been</font>

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,579
freaked out and like put back and going

45
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,860
you know white that's a bit weird he's a

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,990
bit form but you know it's who i am and

47
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna change that for anyone but</font>

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,240
looking back<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my videos saying that</font>

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,119
continued to occur was the fact that i

50
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,389
craved to get out there and you know

51
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,420
beyond the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would promote and</font>

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,890
sometimes it be shameless

53
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,770
motion I do what I want and it's always

54
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">good to have a driving force but it's</font>

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,550
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the balance you know if</font>

56
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,500
its sacrifices something else which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,120
like people's respect then it's not

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,410
worth it you got to get a good balance

59
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,540
and that's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and do everyone</font>

60
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,910
has haters and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking actions</font>

61
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,500
which people go you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,180
scum for doing this blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

63
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,340
you know what it makes me laugh because

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,650
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> do they realize that i actually</font>

65
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,470
have already considered that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

66
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,470
on now and I do make mistakes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

67
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,480
know i'm not perfect but do they realize

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,239
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they post comments like that</font>

69
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,340
which are just slagging me off that they

70
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,830
are just completing that late do they

71
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,190
know that it makes me wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> been safe</font>

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,600
behind side screen being able to type

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,190
text comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish I'd show their face</font>

74
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,040
once in a while or maybe when I get to

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> London gathering summary at</font>

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,880
Leicester Square 1 p.m. they may show

77
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,680
their faces but who knows something

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's built upon me is ego and everyone</font>

79
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,930
has an ego whether it's positive or

80
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,930
negative and for me I've always been

81
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,230
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in promotion like I'm doing my</font>

82
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,049
radio show if i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing my videos if i'm</font>

83
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,910
doing projects like my film<font color="#E5E5E5"> scripts if</font>

84
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,380
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing my band I've always promoted</font>

85
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,720
and I've always wanted to do well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,579
it's desirable people want to do well

87
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,700
but I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on videos and I think have I</font>

88
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,829
has it gone to my head some people think

89
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,780
I'm arrogant and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

90
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,880
because I do see how I come across that

91
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,799
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not I'm just open i have</font>

92
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,000
confidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have charisma i'm open base</font>

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,410
it's what I've always<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to be but</font>

94
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact is like I know I'm not arrogant</font>

95
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,570
but I perceive myself as arrogant when I

96
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,130
look back on my videos and I don't

97
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,079
understand their tool and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

98
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,200
to do a perception and I guess the one

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,910
thing I hate about myself which is human

100
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,630
nature is you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a big ego</font>

101
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,320
and I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I really hate it because</font>

102
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,329
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become risk if it keeps</font>

103
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,380
going and you know how do you you know

104
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,750
an ego makes you strive to become more

105
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,899
and therefore your ego will build when I

106
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,030
I've had emails for example from people

107
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,990
saying that

108
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,880
I've had such huge inspiration their

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,610
life you know I've I've been the reason

110
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,080
why they've got married to someone these

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,819
are real example how do I react to that

112
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,220
by appreciate it but to some extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

113
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,710
register that and think right I'm doing

114
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">something good here I need to progress</font>

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,800
with that and therefore make sure more

116
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,020
of these successful occurrences occur

117
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,430
because it's benefiting other people

118
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,530
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to do but therefore</font>

119
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,000
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to acknowledge that would be</font>

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,830
considered arrogant<font color="#CCCCCC"> it boosts my ego</font>

121
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,110
because I'd be feeling good about it and

122
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,430
therefore doing it more and therefore

123
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,870
I'd be doing more of the same thing

124
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,610
which would include probably meet

125
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,720
bringing up the fact that that's

126
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,650
happened it's it's intense but it's

127
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">human nature i guess to a certain degree</font>

128
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,659
and i also get frustrated about human

129
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,610
nature generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could face so many</font>

130
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,650
things out the air you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are human</font>

131
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,849
by get annoyed from it if there's a girl

132
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:22,680
you really love<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can't have her</font>

133
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,210
you feel bitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do there's a girl that</font>

134
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,580
I've been chatting for ages i like so

135
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,320
much and i try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it work out and</font>

136
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,849
she's not interested she wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

137
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:35,130
just friends I physically can't because

138
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,509
I've always wanted to be more than just

139
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,789
a friend and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel better</font>

140
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it now that's bad you know that's</font>

141
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,820
that selfish on my behalf because she

142
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,190
wishes to be friends which is fine but

143
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accept that is</font>

144
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,509
subconscious level but that's the you

145
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,780
know reality of it and I hate that I

146
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,690
hate sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you're willing to put</font>

147
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,830
other people at a risk in order to save

148
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself and when I did a awesome for</font>

149
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,690
big rubber we were asked to extend that

150
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">either side if we were willing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

151
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:12,930
something and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why didn't</font>

152
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they assumed I was lying</font>

153
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,289
which was if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a job and you</font>

154
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,990
did an action which would require you to

155
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,610
be sacked but someone else got the blame

156
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,199
and they would get sex would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

157
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,479
the rap and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would and that may</font>

158
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,880
they don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> me but firstly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

159
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,630
well if I took the blame the the

160
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,789
consequences you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

161
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:37,409
severe as someone who would deny because

162
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:38,280
I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and all</font>

163
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,750
so I couldn't live on my conscience of

164
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,550
you know having someone take the blame

165
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,980
and losing their job and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

166
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,660
I let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> my cup to begin with if I've</font>

167
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,080
messed up I would take it but I know a

168
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,340
lot of people like that in life that

169
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,680
they will go for what benefits them and

170
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,810
I don't know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> act in that way</font>

171
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,470
is desirable but there's so many aspects

172
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,820
human nature I could speak from that in

173
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,610
a time and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what I hate</font>

174
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,980
about myself and this ego thing really

175
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,100
bugs me because I hope when people meet

176
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">me in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> London tomorrow they realize i'm</font>

177
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,530
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> at myself and this isn't the front I</font>

178
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">suppose so on he met me at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> University</font>

179
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,460
she saw my videos before she came here

180
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,250
and she said to me today that and we're

181
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this she thought that I</font>

182
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,570
was a quiet guy in that I use this to

183
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,510
yourself as a vet a way of venting my

184
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,370
emotions out when it's not unlikely some

185
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">real life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you meet me I will chat like</font>

186
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,540
this I don't know so what am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

187
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,460
you I'm asking you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in the camera</font>

188
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,960
and honestly say what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you don't</font>

189
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like and do you think you can do</font>

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,710
anything to build on it for me it's

191
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,690
human nature so it's just a battle of

192
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,330
what a gut feeling feels good and what I

193
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,960
needs to work on his habits I guess but

194
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah this isn't like I've spoken a lot</font>

195
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,500
about me I guess it's a good example but

196
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,390
I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> want everyone to start the</font>

197
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,789
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and say it and speak</font>

198
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:04,860
their mind just really speak your mind

199
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and not worry about what people think</font>

200
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just be true and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

201
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,470
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> back on it and go you know what</font>

202
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,120
I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying good there I've managed</font>

203
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">to open up say what's on my mind and I</font>

204
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,890
can work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out because I've</font>

205
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,020
identified the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore</font>

206
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,479
other people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me identify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

207
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,789
solution I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but even if your</font>

208
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,870
sony doesn't usually respond to me I'm

209
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,890
really asking you to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

210
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,679
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the one video and one idea that</font>

211
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,710
I feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone can benefit from</font>

212
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,669
because I'm definitely benefiting from

213
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,280
it you know we can help each other

214
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,089
progresses individuals so yeah it's

215
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,240
enough from me I'll see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> later people</font>

216
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">take care</font>
