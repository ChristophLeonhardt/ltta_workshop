Jackson got blocked on Twitter by Donna Brazile jr. got blocked by jr. got blocked okay sorry okay did I mention T YT that come /join they become a member you get all of our shows including the postgame alright let's have fun alright we start off with the doozy bad decision by Andrew Cuomo in New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has decided to end an investigation into how the district attorney in New York handled a case of sexual assault that was alleged against Harvey Weinstein now when the whole Harvey Weinstein story broke there was a recording made by an Italian model where it appeared that Harvey Weinstein admitted to sexually assaulting her that evidence was then presented to district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr in New York and he decided not to press any charges or prosecute Harvey I'm sorry Harvey Weinstein yes okay so that became a bit of a scandal and then you look into some of the funding that this district attorney's office had received and they had received $10,000 in donations from the law firm representing Harvey Weinstein yes so at that point Governor Andrew Cuomo comes in and says this is unacceptable we need to launch an investigation into the DA's office to see what the hell is going on we got to figure out what the hell is going on okay he has since reversed that decision so there are layers of politics and corruption in this story so I believe that that Cuomo's decision was political in a couple of different ways but the most important part of this story is the underlying fundamental part is the corruption of our entire system right but the most important political part is what this is going to do to Cuomo because it looks real bad if Cynthia Nixon pressed on this open wound there's some chance that look sometimes one issue was your whole election that people get so mad about this that it could cost them and why did Cuomo do it because it can't help himself so let's give you details and I will explain the different layers okay so just to repeat myself and make sure that we're clear the DA's office Cyrus Vance Jr the District Attorney had received $10,000 in donations from the law firm representing Harvey Weinstein there was never any prosecution okay yeah and to be clear he got it a couple months after he declined to prosecute so I don't know what's worse or better if you get it ahead of time or afterwards and if it includes a wink or a nod so Andrew Cuomo says we need to investigate this and figure out why the DA decided not to prosecute Harvey Weinstein but news developed indicating that no the governor has decided to completely dropped it well suspend this investigation and people were wondering why now David Sirota dug into this story and has a possible reason why and he writes in capital and main com New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has halted an investigation to the handling of the Weinstein case just as Boies law firm gave Cuomo's campaign $25,000 so boys is why sees Laura or was why sees Laura until very recently so he's going around handing out checks to all the people who might prosecute why see what a nice coincidence for Weinstein and it turns out they all decide that they are gonna drop investigations left and right this is the third time we're clarifying Cuomo did not drop an investigation of Weinstein he dropped an investigation of the prosecutor who would not prosecute Weinstein exactly but charges and investigations are being dropped left and right as checks are being dropped left and right so and and to be extra clear the investigations into Harvey Weinstein continue so this is not about Harvey Weinstein anymore this is about investigating the district attorney and the decision that was made to not initially investigate Harvey Weinstein or prosecute him after allegations had come forward Cuomo and March called for the New York Attorney General's Office to investigate the handling of the case which revolved around accusations that Weinstein groped an Italian model so at the time Cuomo said quote it is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases unless of course I get $25,000 in my reelection campaign then all of a sudden the public's trust isn't as important I added that last part obviously all right let me go to gravity five here because this is in a lot of ways the most important part of the story because it gives you the overall picture in all boys and his law firm have given Cuomo's gubernatorial campaigns more than two hundred and forty five thousand dollars since 2009 so let me give you Cuomo's excuse and then I'll break down what I think actually happened Cuomo says I don't know it's since they're prosecuting now I didn't want to investigate the the prosecutor because the defense attorney could use some of the evidence we uncovered maybe to help Weinstein I need to say hey you know what maybe that's a legitimate point as to why they might want to suspend the investigation but you knew that before so why now decide to drop the investigation of the prosecutor okay so let's now rewind and tell you what I think are the real motivations here so Cyrus Vance does not prosecute he gets a $10,000 check against Weinstein yeah and and until it blows up really so yes he's embarrassed because he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar and then decides to prosecute otherwise his career is ruined okay cuz why seize such an obvious monster and now everyone knows it before Cyrus Vance knew it because he had all the evidence he just chose not to pursue it so look at what's wrong with the system we allow campaign contributions to prosecutors yeah she I wonder if that's a system that's gonna lead to corruption of course the rich will give money to prosecutors not to get prosecuted something let's just acknowledge how insane that is acknowledged yeah wolf dash pack.com if you're not fighting to get money out of politics well with these oligarchs gonna rule us I mean this it's this system is defined by corruption it's you don't want to talk about rigged it's rigged on behalf of the rich by definition okay of course you shouldn't be allowed to give money to a prosecutor that's insanity even if it's for his campaign so now go to Cuomo Cuomo decides that he's gonna investigate Cyrus Vance Jr it's not because poor moe is so deeply ethical and he was moved by the the fact that Vance wouldn't prosecute no they're their politicians in the same state in the same party so hey this is a good way to dig my opponent and make sure he doesn't get up okay if you're not aware of New York politics history a ton there's no reason you should be let me just fill you in real quick Cuomo had started another investigation earlier on an unrelated topic and when the investigation about ethics turned to him and it turned out he had done some seriously unethical things he immediately ended the investigation said oh we're done here wait but they didn't give a report and they were investigating you it's a trump-like move he's like no we're done with that and now we're going crazy over Trump as we should considering firing Muller in essence Cuomo fired his own mother okay and so now he's like oh look at the I have found ethical problems I will now investigate this other guy who might one day be a challenger to me okay now boys comes in and goes hey remember all that money I gave you what do you think I gave it four and plus have another $25,000 check for you okay so the governor can decide whether they're gonna do investigations of the prosecutors the district attorney they and it's so many other monumentally important decisions and we allow people to bribe them what boys can say in boys look he's a lawyer he represents his clients I get it I get it and he's a progressive and he's a good guy and maybe he likes Cuomo maybe he gave it because he just loves Cuomo I don't care what I care about is a system that says here's quarter of a million dollars and then maybe you do what I tell you to do maybe you don't well golly gee I guess we'll never know so okay so the vast majority of that money was previously given to cuomo by the law firm where boys is a partner right the additional $25,000 was the new money that was given to cuomo after he had launched this investigation against the prosecutors so then he ends up suspending this investigation and so yes look we can't definitively say that that $25,000 was the factor that led to his decision right I speculate that it was I have reason to believe that it was and if it's proven that that was the reason why he did it this could cost him his political career right I mean if Cynthia Nixon plays this the way that we hope she plays it right think about it he launched this investigation gets 20 fights all it took $25,000 to investigate prosecutors to end the investigation of prosecutors like that's all it took $25,000 is not a lot of money yeah no no politicians can be bought pretty cheap it's actually a great great investment so why is this in capital in Maine David sir doing a fantastic job why is it a headline in New York Times he's the New York governor don't you think it's a little bit relevant well because the mainstream media is actually 100% used to corruption and they've viewed to be standard course like well of course I mean you could of course you give quarter of a million dollars to Cuomo he does exactly what you tell them to but that's a coincidence guys that's a coincidence so now look the 245 makes a difference even before you get to the 25 because there's a history of corruption here we give you money you do what we tell you now they had this comical statement that they put out a spokesperson for the law firm said neither mr. Boies nor anyone from his firm ever discussed Harvey Weinstein or mr. Vance with mr. Cuomo or anyone from his office at any time of course you think boys who's one of the best lawyers in the country is gonna be enough of a schmuck to say now remember Andrew this is $25,000 check to buy you make sure you drop the investigation you think Cuomo doesn't know he's ycs lawyer okay so I again whether you think this particular check is connected to this particular decision is not nearly as important as how deeply deeply corrupt the system is where you can just buy politicians by prosecutors and then we have no idea why you did it and why he took the actions that he did do you guys trust a Cuomo did it for purely ethical real ideological principle reasons well how could you possibly trust that even if quote was a great guy how could you trust that he got brought because he gets systematically bribed by the way yes like all other politicians do but the New York Times and everyone else is like oh well that's yeah well hey another coincidence okay no big deal let's just move on here but look I agree with Ana people are sick of it absolutely sick of it and why scene is a poster child for the rich and the powerful getting away with things that they shouldn't have no business getting away with into you know you you wouldn't get anywhere near getting away with and nor should you but he might you and you know it and he had and he did for all those years now new york times before also covered for Weinstein when they mainly sold ads and that's how they got their revenue and wise these companies were huge advertisers of the New York Times now they mainly work on a subscription model all of a sudden they run the YC story now but Cuomo look there is a little bit of truth to what the right-wing says about the media it's not that they're liberal it's not anywhere close to that right but do they know the Democratic politicians and give them more of a break it's that not progressives but establishment Democrats a little bit yeah because if Trump had done this they'd be all over them Cuomo does it just keeps on taking bribe after bribe after bribed I grant you it's legal but it's brazen in Cuomo's case he'll take money from the real estate industry and then turn around and you giant tax breaks for the real estate industry in New York oh I am helping to stimulate the economy I've seen this game before it's happening in LA as well yeah and I see what the Republicans I see it with Democrats the only people who can't apparently are the rest of the media who have been trained to accept corruption as a status quo and not to challenge it so not only do I challenge Cuomo on this but I challenge the New York Times this is you missed Alexandra Castillo Cortez and now you're sitting on your hands as you have a deeply corrupt governor what are you doing I thought you were the great mighty New York Times you might want to get to it yeah all right moving on to other news White House Counsel Don began will no longer be the White House Counsel he will be out of the White House in the fall apparently Magan learned about this through Twitter when Trump announced it he said through his tweet that the White House Counsel dawn began will be leaving his position in the fall shortly after the confirmation hopefully of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court I have worked with Don for a very long time or for a long time and truly appreciate his service so it was a nice complimentary you know reaction or response to McGann but Trump has had some issues with McGann as of late remember there was a huge story involving Don Magan testifying or cooperating with robert muller the special counselor counsel in the russia investigation there was also a little bit of conflict with trump on the issue of whether or not to pardon Paul Manafort and they have been butting heads so it appears that Trump made this decision and who knows who he plans on replacing Don began with no but here's the fun part of the story McGann apparently found out through Twitter yeah I said that yeah and so he's like oh you jus were you gonna tell me that we had not coordinated at all on when I was gonna leave and how we were gonna announce it come on McGann you're surprised you know what a clown he is you know what a buffoon he is and then McGann we found out a couple of weeks ago in the New York Times had talked to the prosecutor special counsel as Anna told you and and Trump apparently didn't know so at the time Trump plated Fez agrees a quote from him I allowed White House Council down began and all other requested members of the White House staff to fully cooperate with the special counsel okay all right great you allowed him to cooperate so everything's hunky-dory right and then why did you turn around a couple of weeks later really again is sleeping okay he we had a good relationship but he's gone okay I guess like what what what happened so so we had covered that story in detail when it originally broke but just to remind you all of what happened Trump had his own personal lawyers at the White House and they were the ones who were encouraging Magan to cooperate with Muller and it was because these attorneys who are no longer working with Trump genuinely believed that Trump was innocent that hadn't done anything with Russia and so they're urging Magan to cooperate Magan and truck don't trust each other at this point so Magan was under the assumption that Trump was trying to screw him over and and put him in a position where he would take the fall for this whole Russia investigation so it begins like okay fine I'm gonna cooperate and I'm gonna cooperate fully so he spoke to Muller for 30 hours but here's the thing Trump and his attorneys are so incompetent that none of them asked for a briefing on what was discussed they had no idea how long he had spoken to Muller it was a complete and utter disaster and my favorite part of that story was many months later after he testified and he talked and McGann talked about what trumpet with Comey how he has sessions to you know stop being the Attorney General or was looking to find out how he can get sessions to stop being attorney Jo because he had recuse himself and would not protect Donald Trump from investigation and by the way we found that also that McGann threatened to resign at one point when Trump wanted a fire Muller so all that was what he testified to and then McGann sat around waiting waiting waiting for the rest of Trump strategy and he's like wait why is he throwing me under the bus I thought he was gonna do that and that's why he allowed me to testify and then realized oh he has no strategy and so the New York Times wrote that he began and his own personal lawyer it dawned on them later that the Trump had no plan and that he actually was not being adversarial to me McGann just didn't know what he was doing he had already given that evidence the Muller which is a great break for us and what did I tell you he's gonna get caught rumpus because he's deeply stupid and he couldn't manage his way out of a paper bag including in this case so and here's my third favorite part of this story and a White House insider that often deals with the in fact he's a former White House official he's anonymous at talking to the hill said the White House counsel's office that's baganz office is an island of competence and professionalism in an otherwise chaotic and amateurish West way that sounds about right and and he said of course that day it'll be a tremendous loss if you have to wonder if this well-oiled machine well-oiled machine please starts to sputter a bit after he leaves okay there's no well-oiled machine so you can tell the guy actually is a very much a Republican yeah and supportive but he's like yeah it's mainly because I'm against competence otherwise is chaotic and amateurs Magana has actually done a lot for Trump he helped Trump confirm 60 federal judges 60 and what does he get in return well you weren't super loyal to Donald Trump personally and you didn't cover up his crimes so one day you wake up and there's a tweet saying oh you're leaving when you didn't even know you were leaving I think it's a good thing from again oh yeah yeah I know if I'm again I'm thinking oh thanks God I thought it'd never come that's like the tweet from heaven all right let's take a break when we come back we're gonna give you some updates on foreign policy stories we're gonna talk to you about what's going on in Puerto Rico lots of news you don't want to miss it come right back we hope you're

right great great point Pete McEnroe says I wonder if that's Patrick I think that Michael shores friends with Patrick McEnroe so there's like a 7% chance that that's actually him anyway the only non corrupt thing about Andrew Cuomo is that Chris chrome was not allowed to cover him I got and I'm part of the reason I read that he says the other night and one of the shows I made the mistake of saying Andrew Cuomo when I meant Chris Cuomo Cuomo were Chris Cuomo was the one that again was saying about a progressive well but in fact I'm sorry that was last night Andrew Gilliam he said yeah he's for Medicare for all but how is he gonna pay for that Chris Cuomo I kind of like the guy but he says that every time crazy all right and my favorite dan dan goes rights in looks like corruption is still the status quo mo come on that's really good alright we got to go what's next all right several months ago Donald Trump met with kim jeong-hoon in a summit meeting in order to discuss deep nuclearized in north korea and possibly bettering relations between the united states and and north korea but it turns out that several months later after Trump had agreed to stop doing joint military exercises with South Korea because he can consider them provocative he has decided to continue doing those joint military exercises because North Korea hasn't actually denuclearized North Korea hasn't actually done anything which is what we predicted would happen and so as a result defense secretary Jim mattis during a press conference address this and essentially said yeah that suspension lifted take a look as you know we took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit we have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises we will work very closely as I said with the Secretary of State and what he needs done we will certainly do to reinforce his effort but at this time there is no discussion about further suspensions so I want to also correct myself because I made one small error in the intro to the story so North Korea did send back some remains of American soldiers that they had essentially kept so that's one thing that they did but they're still moving forward with their nuclear weapons development there is documentation proving that and so it was clear to me because Trump had a bargaining chip and that bargaining chip included the joint military exercises but all it took was one meeting where an individual's had complimentary things to trump and he's immediately regurgitating North Korean propaganda talking points and one of those talking points was that these joint military exercises were provocative so Jake before you jump in I just want to refresh everyone's memory about the propaganda tour that Trump went on immediately after meeting with kim jeong-hoon suggested and i want to do is we're gonna stop the war games flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place and then go back to Guam we are gonna get out of the the war games that cost so much money so under the circumstances is that we're negotiating a very comprehensive complete deal I think it's inappropriate to be having wargames and I'm doing something that I've wanted to do from the beginning we stop playing those war games that cost us a fortune war games are very expensive we pay for a big majority of them we fly in bombers from Guam I know a lot about airplanes it's very expensive because I think number one is very provocative and I want to do it and I think they're very happy about it because it is so provocative and I think it's very provocative it's a very provocative situation you know I wanted to stop the war games I thought they were very provocative but I also think they're very expensive it really is something that I think they very much appreciated and I think it's very provocative especially George since we're getting along oops so they then followed up and asked Jim mattis well president Trump said over and over again that the war games were very provocative and you're now doing that again so are you trying to provoke North Korea that's an excellent question because now normally no we're just doing military exercises like we've always done but the president said it was provocative so are you trying to provoke them then man has had the kind of backpedal and say well I mean we're not turning them back on they've never been turned off we're going to see how the negotiations go and then we'll calculate the future how we go forward in the future how we go forward yeah he can't answer it because the the president's an idiot and so you know what cute I don't blame mattis what's he supposed to do and the Trump put him in an untenable situation so now let's have fun in the middle of those clips you saw now I know a lot about planes they're expensive first of all who says I know a lot about planes okay I'm moving on and then follows it with they're expensive as if no one knows that no one knows no but you know why I said it cuz remember he had Trump planes and as usual went bankrupt he's like I know casinos they're very expensive I know steaks they're very expensive because you bankrupted every company you ever had that's why you think they are expensive you're more so speaking of how stupid he is I don't know if you guys have heard me say that before so here are the things that he's said about North Korea other than the videos that we just showed you there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea who makes a statement like that when they hadn't done one single thing to denuclearize they had all they had done was compliment your stupid stupid childish ass so they went and they're like no mr. president you're a very important person he's like good there are no more nuclear weapons in North but there is at least I'm trying to make them and they didn't Dino guards at all he also said it will be total denuclearization which is already starting to take place what not remotely true it was not starting to take place and of course there's not total denuclearization and they said well these negotiations what was the result correct answer is hey it was a good beginning you should talk to your enemies and that's how you get the peace in which case we'd be like hey Trump nice work good start ok we told we said that before he went right so we're on the record instead he comes on goes tremendous success so ok but like you can say hey it's a good beginning but if you say it's a tremendous success and they don't have nukes anymore then they have you they have no incentive to actually denuclearize because you're already in a little world that they did they can they can just keep going and then you look like an idiot yeah I mean look he bungled it in so many different ways and that's what we were talking about on the show at the time of this summit and people got on us a lot of progressives got on us because they're like oh you want war you don't want peace this is a good thing no but this is a political issue a foreign policy issue that's not black and white it is complicated and yes it's a good thing to sit down with your enemies and have a conversation a negotiation about how to move forward in order to accomplish a peaceful agreement Trump is incapable of that so when that summit took place yeah we criticized him because he was like oh here's my bargaining chip I give you I give you bargaining chip no but you know you hold on to the bargaining chip and make sure that you have verification you have a time you have some indication some proof that they're actually going to denuclearize and then you talk about what you're gonna give them in return including suspending the so-called war games by the way I don't really care about whether or not we do war games but if it's a bargaining chip then yes let's use that to our advantage he didn't do that he gave everything way immediately and North Korea did nothing they continue developing nuclear weapons I'll end on three goofy points okay okay number one I would love to play poker with Donald Trump oh my god mr. Trump your hair is so nice it's going nice and orange fine I have a jack ten unsuited this is super random are you ready for Trump in a second I love the names of these exercises the one that's gonna happen but these are ones they're like mediocre it could be better the one that's about to happen because it's back on its fall eagle anything with a bird sounds good oh yeah I don't even know what fall is and it doesn't sound great fo al okay but it's got eagle in it good enough okay you could be like mighty dove and I'm like yeah let's do this Yello let's go yeah the one that was canceled earlier although now mattis is having to say well nothing was canceled but it was it's back on even though it never went off Noah's castle was Ulchi freedom Guardian I don't know what og is at maybe it's a Korean word I don't know but it doesn't matter yeah you could take that out okay we don't speak Korean okay I know they do any freedom guardians of the galaxy maybe slightly goofy yesterday in the postgame after our gigantic long coverage of the elections Jon and I discussed what a Blue Falcon is now Blue Falcon sounds pretty cool but it's not in the postgame but it's not it turns out it's it's military slang for something that is very wrong okay if you want to find out what that is hey you can just google it in five seconds or you could become a Young Turks member and get that fun post game from yesterday t y-t-dot-com /join alright and and then what was the last thing I was gonna tell you guys that was about goofy Donald Trump oh yes and then the last thing is look should you talk to your enemies just to double down on an I was saying of course we've been through down times now the question is what do you get right so should you talk to Iran Dick Cheney said no Arad was ready to cooperate with us back right after the 9/11 attacks because they also hate al Qaeda and and then later actually after we invaded Iraq in a surprising move this is a rare moment where the New York a sort of movement had a chance at working Iran did get a little spooked and was like okay maybe we talked to you about you know some of the things you want and Dick Cheney's like we don't talk to evil so dumb okay on the other hand so Obama goes talk to Iran they get a good deal we actually do deep nuclear eyes Iran they just had energy programs they didn't have weapons programs but great fantastic let's you know take away any potential for nuclear arms now if Trump had gotten Iran we would have said good I'm glad he's going to Iran but what if he came out of the negotiations said it's a tremendous success we gave them San Antonio but still it's wonderful you'd like I wanted you to talk to them I didn't want you to give up a US city if the situation with North Korea wasn't enough evidence to prove that Trump is a horrible negotiator just consider when he was really genuinely thinking about doing for Vladimir Putin after the Helsinki summit remember Putin wanted to do the shakedown of US officials and Trump was like no no sounds like a good deal what what so if you think the Trump is not corrupt then you've got to think he's the worst negotiator ever because Putin's like hey why don't you hand over your former US ambassador for me to interrogate and a couple other people you might never see them again but in return I will let you talk to to our agents our spies who of course will give you nothing in return right and I will help you with your investigation of me oh come on any rational person with just like an IQ of 49 or higher would go wait you're gonna help my investigation of you and the way that you're gonna do that is I'm gonna give you all the documents in that investigation of you you'd laugh at the guy out of the room troubles like that is a very good deal I'm very interested in that deal Iran will just have to be like hey Donald you want a ham sandwich okay I mean we're muzzles were against him but I'll give you a ham sandwich but throw in Seattle to SoCo deal deal I go oh you guys you'll never believe this a good ahem sandwich I did I gave up Senate in San Antonio seat all right let me sign the paperwork before you make me that sandwich though Oh turns out I didn't get it okay but but still still I'm thinking about getting a Nobel Peace Prize Oh disaster how's that coming one all right let's move from one Trump failure to the next hurricane Maria we have new we have a new death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria the official death toll was 64 and that was the previous official death toll everyone knew that that was not accurate and luckily there has now been an investigation into the number of people who have died and the number is actually closer to 3,000 so officials said the 2975 people died in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria last September the revised death toll as I had mentioned is nearly 50 times the previous estimate of 64 so the numbers are different because a number of different things the initial number of 64 only counted the people who had died during the hurricane because of the storm so if the building that they were in collapsed or if they were hit by debris and died as a result of that but a number of people died thousands of people died after that because of all of the issues that they had to deal with in their infrastructure the lack of electricity the spread of diseases those counted or this new number counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor health care and a lack of electricity and water repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis now they are asking the US government Congress specifically for additional funding 139 billion dollars in recovery funds with the GOP in charge I question whether or not that's even possible but that is what they're asking for and I think you know as a u.s. territory puerto rico needs more help they certainly did not get the same amount of help that texas and florida did after they were hit with hurricanes in the same time period but yeah this is insane we have video shrimp patting himself on the back because he thought that his response to hurricane maria was excellent hold on yeah let me you just a little bit of context before we go to trump so this is now the second deadliest storm in in US history at least over a century now it's a little apples and oranges because the deadliest storm was in Galveston Texas in the year 1900 and at least 8,000 people died in that case within hours they obviously didn't have great warning systems at the time the storm hits out of nowhere kills all those people now the number is probably way higher because just like in this case I'm sure a lot of people died afterwards through in the devastation but in recent storms they count the devastation as part of the death toll but that's actually in a sense more tragic because a storm hits out of nowhere and a tree falls on you and you die these it's hard to prevent that the early warning system etc and in a good way to evacuate people is super important so you can prevent a lot of that but it but it's harder but in terms of making sure that electricity don't he doesn't get cut off so that a patient in the hospital doesn't die that is really preventable but we chose not to prevent exactly and and that makes this death toll even more tragic right and look this hurricane hit in September of last year mind you at this time the Trump administration was really pushing for those tax cuts for the wealthy and when it came to the response efforts or the relief efforts in Puerto Rico Trump kept saying over and over that it was expensive that this was really hurting the u.s. budget where's I'm not a u.s. territory if you're really concerned about the u.s. budget if you're worried about not having enough revenue or enough you know money in the federal government to help Americans well then maybe don't cut taxes anyway I want to go to this video because again Trump really congratulated himself because he thought that his response to Hurricane Maria was excellent Mick Mulvaney is here right there and Mick is a judge of a thing called budget and I know you appreciate our support because our country has really gone all out to help and no no dangerous it's expensive I hate to tell you Porto Rico but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that's fine we've saved a lot of lives you can be very proud of all of your people all of our people working together 16 versus literally thousands of people you can be very proud everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what's taking place in Puerto Rico if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overpowering so after every trunk video you have to unpack exceed packs so much stupid into such a short period of time so let's break down all the horrible things that he said first of all just comically in the beginning there's Mick Mulvaney in charge of a thing called the budget okay all right we're moving on no he didn't save the budget he said in charge of of budget like it wasn't it in charge of a thing called budget called budget yeah okay well what is that what's what language is that okay all right but much worse you should be really proud only 16 died and Hurricane Katrina a real catastrophe killed more it's not a game it's not ratings for a reality show and now I guess what they're supposed to be not proud because it turns out less people died in Hurricane Katrina than died in this storm right person who should not be proud is you because instead of going to help those people and if you had helped them at that point when you were at that press conference thousands of people might not have died because of the consequence of that storm instead you were saying as you saw in that clip well you know you guys are really hurting our budget who's you guys they're part of the United States of America and look at his frame of thinking right Houston and Florida should be helped but Puerto Rico you're hurting our budget so I want to elaborate a little more on on you know the Hurricane Katrina versus Hurricane Maria rhetoric that you heard there so he said Hurricane Katrina was a disaster hundreds upon hundreds died actually more than hundreds died okay it was about half of the number of people who died in Hurricane Maria but it was in the thousands so it's over a thousand about 1,500 yeah no it's 1830 oh wow close to 2,000 people but the point that I'm bringing up is that was a horrible horrible moment for the Bush administration it put a huge stain on the Bush administration and it will never be forgotten and it was one of those horrible moments in American history where Kanye West came forward and said George Bush doesn't care about black people right that was a famous line that Kanye West had made now more people have died in hurricane Maria's aftermath but just this is a side note Kanye West loved Donald Trump no problem there but Trump's sitting there talking about how he's better like he's more successful his response was better no it was it was actually worse more people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria vs. Hurricane Katrina and you're right it's not a competition but he's the one who's decided to make it a competition when in reality his efforts should be focused on helping people again American citizens who desperately need your help yeah so in terms of the the comparing the two presidents right so Bush was really late in responding seemed like he didn't care he had the famous picture of him just looking at the city but from above and not being on the ground etc and that was really terrible but we had no idea what was in store for us which was stormed Trump and and even like Bush it used to say I got my budget man and we thought that was just the dumbest thing ever to call your budget director now you know it always gets force it's like the Republican presidents are photocopies of each other it just keeps degrading over time yeah so now Trump goes in and goes Mulvaney in charge of a thing called budget right and now Maria worse than Katrina Trump more indifferent and he goes throws paper towels at people and then comes back and says they were beautiful soft towels he said that like what why are you what they were normal people tells you what's wrong with you so as always with these guys when you think he can't get worse it does yeah I want to end with a quick video of the mayor of San Juan now as you know she has been very vocal a vocal opponent of Trump but I do want you to hear what she had to say after the numbers were updated and it was revealed that nearly 3,000 Puerto Ricans died in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina so let's skip ahead to video 5 the Trump administration killed the Puerto Rican would neglect the Trump administration letters to believe that they were helping when they weren't really up to par a shame on President Trump shame on President turned for not even once not even yesterday just saying look I grieve with the people of Puerto Rico shame on him first of all he doesn't even take a time of the day to say look I'm sorry that you people are grieving I'm sorry that your people died and secondly what is there to be proud of 2975 dead is that what he's proud of is he proud of that maybe this is over now and he thinks it's gonna go away it's not going to go away we're gonna remember this forever this will be a stain in his presidency for as long as he lives because rather than coming here to support us he came here to throw paper towels at us and if you don't really that's a great line in its own fortunately true if you don't remember that famous video let's go to video four and remind you of what he did he and you could tell him that flipping attitude yet in the press conference he carried that over he's supposed to be helping the victims maybe some of their family members died they're all devastated they've lost everything they came for just to get paper towels that's how desperate a situation they're in and here's how Trump handled it he likes any ability to empathize with people yep and and that's a defining trait of sociopaths no empathy at all okay it's quick break now when we come back we have not yet gotten to the two best stories but they are coming up as so one is immediate nuclear racism from the Republican in the Florida governor's race against Andrew Gilliam the progressive champion that won last night and boy I've got a lot of to say about that and then Donald Trump we told you yesterday about his meeting with evangelical leaders he actually said worse yeah worse I mean it's a murderers row of horrific things to say talked about the violence we talked about that yesterday a little bit on that in the in the show but there are three devolve encoder that I don't want you to miss it and in the last one actually for the first time convinced me no he might actually I've always thought he was painfully dumb but his mind might actually be deteriorating worse than we realized because I want you to listen to it and see if you could decipher what in the world he means it's a it's a little frightening actually so and of course a lot of you get the whole show some of you watch and listen in different places and you don't get all of it it's a two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern on T y-t-dot-com slash live and if you want to get the whole show anytime you want become a member and join us at TYT com
