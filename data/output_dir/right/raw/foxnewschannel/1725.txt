â™ª

2
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:07,880
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,615
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

4
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:10,916
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS DO?

5
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,718
WE HAVE A SENSE FROM KIM

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:14,420
JONG UN THAT AT LEAST HIS

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,754
UPCOMING CHAT WITH SOUTH

8
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:16,755
KOREAN COUNTERPART IS ALL

9
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:17,490
FOR THE TIME BEING.

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,858
IS IT ONLY FOR THE TIME

11
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:19,158
BEING?

12
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:21,660
IF THAT'S OFF BIG MEETING

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,595
BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND THE

14
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:23,195
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:24,363

SINGAPORE LESS THAN A MONTH

FROM NOW?

18
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:27,333
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

19
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,834
SAY, MAYBE SHOULD NOT SAY

20
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,936
FROM THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE

21
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:32,738
DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF THAT'S

22
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:33,539
KARL ROVE.

23
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,707
CARL, THIS SORT OF CAME OUT

24
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:35,875
OF NOWHERE.

25
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,243
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING

26
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:39,211
MAYBE IT'S JUST THE COLD

27
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,312
FEET NORTH KOREAN, YOU KNOW,

28
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:41,647
COUNTER TO ALL OF WHAT HAS

29
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,015
BEEN GOING ON.

30
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,484
OR THAT SOMETHING MORE

31
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:46,452
INVOLVED COULD BE AFOOT

32
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:46,752
HERE.

33
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:48,787
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:51,857
>> I WOULD IGNORE IT KIM

35
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:54,693
JONG UN IS PROBABLY PROBING,

36
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:57,162
SEEING IF HE CAN GET A

37
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:57,530
RESPONSE.

38
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,398
CAN HE BY RATTLING HIS CAGE

39
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:00,232
CAUSE THE UNITED STATES AND

40
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:04,602
SOUTH KOREA TO FORESWEAR

41
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:05,738
THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM,

42
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:07,339
MILITARY EXERCISES?

43
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:08,641
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATIONS

44
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:09,775
WOULD BE SMART TO JUST

45
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:12,378
IGNORE IT AND PLOW ON.

46
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:14,113
LET THE ONUS BE ON HIM.

47
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:16,582
HE KNEW THESE EXERCISES WERE

48
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:16,916
COMING.

49
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:17,850
THEY EARLIER SAID THEY

50
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,318
DIDN'T OBJECT TO THEM IN

51
00:01:19,318 --> 00:01:21,453
THEIR CURRENT FORM.

52
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:22,688
AND HE IS ACTING OUT TO SEE

53
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,990
IF CAN HE GET A RESPONSE.

54
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,692
DON'T GIVE HIM ONE.

55
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:27,426
>> Neil: I'M TOLD HE WAS

56
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:28,894
GIVEN A HEADS UP.

57
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:30,029
I DON'T KNOW HOW TRUE THAT

58
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:30,296
IS.

59
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:31,697
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

60
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:36,068
I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS AN

61
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,536
ACTIVE IMPULSIVENESS HERE

62
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,437
THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

63
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:40,339
DEEMED SIMILARLY IMPULSIVE.

64
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:41,774
WORKED TO ADVANTAGE GETTING

65
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,309
THESE TALKS WHERE THEY ARE.

66
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:44,209
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER ALL

67
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,911
OF A SUDDEN MAY BE FEELING A

68
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:46,645
LITTLE OVERWHELMED HERE.

69
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:48,781
AND THE PRESSURE ON THE

70
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:50,349
WORLD STAGE AT THIS BIG POW

71
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,450
ABOUT NOW SINGAPORE.

72
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,685
LOOKS LIKE IS HE GIVING AWAY

73
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:56,455
MUCH OF THE STORE AHEAD OF

74
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,523
EITHER OF THEM SITTING DOWN.

75
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:59,992
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

76
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,961
>> LET'S NOT UNDER ESTIMATE

77
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,195
THIS IS A SMART ACTOR.

78
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:08,467
REMEMBER, HE TAKES POWER A

79
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:11,503
MONTH BEFORE 27TH BIRTHDAY

80
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:12,805
CONSOLIDATED POWER AND BEEN

81
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:13,839
MADE -- MADE THE SUPREME

82
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:14,473
LEADER IN DECEMBER.

83
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:16,442
HE BECOMES THE FIRST

84
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:17,643
SECRETARY OF THE WORKERS

85
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:18,911
PARTY IN APRIL.

86
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:20,245
HE HAS CONSOLIDATED POWER.

87
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:21,080
IS HE RUTHLESS.

88
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,247
HE HAS KILLED HIS

89
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:22,681
HALF-BROTHER.

90
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,882
HE HAS KILLED HIS UNCLE.

91
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,784
HE HAS KILLED HIS UNCLE'S

92
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:26,118
FAMILY.

93
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:27,720
HE HAS KILLED ASSOCIATES OF

94
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,988
HIS UNCLE ALL OF WHOM HE

95
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:30,089
THOUGHT WERE THREATS TO HIM.

96
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:32,424
THIS IS A METHODICAL

97
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:32,992
DELIBERATE.

98
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:34,293
RUTHLESS DICTATOR.

99
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:35,961
SMART GUY, TUTORED BY HIS

100
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:37,062
FATHER AND GRANDFATHERED.

101
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:46,772
HE HAS THEIR HABITS.

102
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,975
SAID GET RID OF BROKEN

103
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:50,309
PROMISE.

104
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:51,644
LAST TIME THEY LITERALLY

105
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:53,445
SAID WE'LL GIVE UP OUR

106
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,613
PROGRAM AND A MATTER OF DAYS

107
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:56,849
LATER LAUNCHED AN

108
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:57,483
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC

109
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,117
MISSILE THEREBY VIOLATING

110
00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:59,251
THE PLEDGE THAT THEY HAD

111
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,786
JUST GIVEN.

112
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:02,721
SO, LET'S -- HE HAS AGREED

113
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:04,523
TO SHOW UP ON THE 129 OF

114
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:05,658
JUNE IN SINGAPORE.

115
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:06,925
HE IS ONLY GOING TO SHOW UP

116
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,361
BECAUSE HE IS UNDER A

117
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,530
TERRIFIC SET OF SANCTIONS

118
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,398
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

119
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:14,066
PUT IN PLACE THAT BUILD ON

120
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,567
THE SANCTIONS PUT IN PLACE

121
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,636
BY THREE PREVIOUS

122
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:18,037
PRESIDENTS.

123
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:18,704
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GOTTEN

124
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:20,205
TO THE POINT BECAUSE OF HIS

125
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,240
PREDECESSORS THAT HE CAN

126
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,775
SANCTION THE PEOPLE WHO WANT

127
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:23,976
TO DO BUSINESS WHO WANT TO

128
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:25,044
DO BUSINESS WITH THE PEOPLE

129
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:26,779
WHO DO BUSINESS WITH NORTH

130
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:27,079
KOREA.

131
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,813
IT'S THAT TOUGH.

132
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,581
AND SO I JUST PLOW AHEAD.

133
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:31,216
AND MAKE THE ONUS BE ON HIM

134
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,251
IF HE DECIDES HE IS NOT

135
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:34,353
GOING TO SHOW UP.

136
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:35,888
>> Neil: REAL QUICKLY WE ARE

137
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,089
LEARNING, KARL, SWITCHING TO

138
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,290
IRAN THE EUROPEANS ARE GOING

139
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,325
TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO

140
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:41,126
RESCUE, COBBLE TOGETHER,

141
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,227
SAVE THE DEAL, WHATEVER YOU

142
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,395
WANT TO TALK WITH OR WITHOUT

143
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:43,996
THE UNITED STATES.

144
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:44,797
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

145
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,366
>> WELL, SECRETARY POMPEO

146
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:49,201
HAS INDICATED AN OPENNESS TO

147
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,836
CONTINUING TO TALK TO THE

148
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:51,203
EUROPEANS.

149
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:52,371
FRANKLY, I THINK, AGAIN, IT

150
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,238
WOULD BE SMART FOR THE

151
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,306
ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW THAT

152
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:55,240
TO GO FORWARD.

153
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,275
BECAUSE, LOOK, IF WE ARE

154
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,377
GOING TO PUT IN PLACE TOUGH

155
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:00,412
SANCTIONS ON THE IRANIANS IN

156
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:00,813
90 DAYS.

157
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,448
WE WOULD RATHER HAVE THE

158
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:03,115
EUROPEANS WITH US THAN

159
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:03,716
AGAINST US.

160
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:05,784
SO IF THE HAS SAID, I THINK

161
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:06,685
THEY NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR

162
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,922
TO THE EUROPEANS, WE WANT

163
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:10,989
ANY TIME INSPECTIONS.

164
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,691
WE WANT AN END TO THESE

165
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:13,792
PROGRAMS NOT A PAUSE IN

166
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:14,326
THESE PROGRAMS.

167
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:15,861
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE CAPS.

168
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,196
WE WANT TO HAVE PROHIBITION.

169
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,363
AND IF THE EUROPEANS CAN

170
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:19,464
PRESSURE THE IRANIANS SO

171
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:20,632
MUCH THE BETTER FOR US AND

172
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,534
FOR THEM.

173
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,103
>> Neil: YOU KNOW, KARL, YOU

174
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:24,837
ARE SO GOOD.

175
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:26,038
ALL OF THIS IS BREAKING NEWS

176
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:26,772
STUFF THOUGHT WOULD BOUNCE

177
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:27,706
IT OFF OF YOU.

178
00:04:27,706 --> 00:00:00,000
SEE HOW GOOD THIS GUY IS YOU
