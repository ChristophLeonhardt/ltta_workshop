police officials in Las Vegas have released body cam footage of the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas just this past weekend now we're gonna show you some of that footage and it is graphic it is difficult to not only watch but also listen to however it gives you a sense of what police had to go through it gives you a sense of the confusion and you know just the fact that so many people put their lives on the line to help save some of these victims so with that said again graphic warning let's take a look that's so terrifying uh when the video not this video but when videos from victims had been released on social media a lot of people were speculating that he had a automatic weapon an automatic weapon it sounded like an automatic weapon but we now know that he had a semi-automatic weapon and used a device known as a bump stock to essentially turn it into an automatic weapon police have now confirmed that twelve of the weapons that they found in his room were fitted with a bump stock so he had several weapons that had this capability also just to give you some more information through this investigation so far they have not found a motive and it's driving everyone including the investigator investigators crazy now sheriff Lombardo held a press conference yesterday and addressed a number of questions that the press and the public have so I want to show you some of those answers let's take a look at video to first understand later comments the way that you have no idea well I think any person put in her situation would probably answer the same way but like I said we're not privy to investigative leads that were obtained today mr. rouse could probably give you some better clarification to that I haven't been briefed by the FBI on that interview you pezzo get what was the other question sir still trying to figure out whether he had accomplices right yeah we're obviously going through that just troublesome that this individual was able to move this amount of gear into a hotel room unassisted it's troublesome for the amount of stuff he had at both residents unassisted so there's people that know this individual there's people that could help us understand this individual because you know I interesting up I read a periodical today earlier today and it was from an FBI profiler that didn't understand this individual usually there's a cocktail sign associated with these types of actions you know reclusive a plethora things associated with this mindset and we have not found that yet so real quick in the beginning of a statement he addressed a question that the reporter asked him about Mary Lou Dan Lee's statement and Mary Lou Dan Lee was the girlfriend of the shooter she flew back from the Philippines to cooperate with FBI officials and in her statement she said the following graphic 8 it never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone he never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen and so sheriff Lombardo in that press conference said yeah that's the type of answer that I would expect of anyone in this situation but in what way do you expect that do you expect that in that I am protecting my loved one or am I do you expect that in because I don't expect that yeah unless it's I'm protecting my loved one look I think I think sheriff Lombardo is put in a incredibly difficult situation and it's hard to answer these questions without ever speculating and and implying anything that seems speculative that seemed a little speculative though because the way that I read it was that he was implying that you know if she's if she was in any way knowledgeable about what he was gonna do then she's not gonna just tell the FBI like yeah I knew about it but I don't know that's my read of the things are so little for us to actually grab on to and that's what they're getting at that's very disconcerting disorienting it makes you feel great it makes me feel nuts when I think about it and the person I know who was out there that's the one thing that she gret she was at the concert it's the one thing they said yesterday on the show that she's grappling what she's like I mean just the trauma of the experience isn't what's gnawing at her as much as why did he do this and then but then you hear stuff like that and you hear this give interviews in Australia she had she was never like you know tipped off to anything strange about to happen but he said I got you a ticket to the Philippines that's real cheap real cheap so you should go also I'm gonna wire you a hundred thousand dollars that's the opposite of you know someone looking for something really cheap yeah you're right there were also reports confirmed by police that he had purchased 33 weapons in one day and the Las Vegas Journal review reported that he had been prescribed anti-anxiety medication I am gonna be honest with you I haven't seen that reported by any other source as of yet it might be confirmed by other sources as well there have also been reports that he was gambling for eight hours straight prior to the shooting these are all things that you know could play a role in trying to piece together a motive but to be clear there is no you know confirmed motive as of yet and that is driving a lot of people crazy because again he had no criminal record he there's nothing from his past nothing about his displays in public that would you know tip anyone off to this also people are concerned about the fact that he has had a history of booking hotels like at music festivals with a clear view of the content the concert goers the festival goers that happened in August for Lollapalooza and also Patek had reserved a room via Airbnb at the Ogden luxury apartment complex which overlooked the site of the Life is Beautiful festival an event over the previous weekend that featured acts such as gorillas and Lord and when you look at the timeline of his girlfriend being out of town the The Life is Beautiful festival came within the window of her being away so he sent her out at least they have her being in Tokyo going to the Philippines on the fifteenth of September so that falls within the window of him making sure she's there so that he could sensibly take out and you know do this Lombardo also disclosed the fact that they found materials to to make explosives in his car they discovered several containers of explosives and sixteen hundred rounds of additional ammunition in his car I believe ammonium nitrate was one of the materials that they found in his vehicle I want to also talk a little bit about the fact that some evidence in the room made it appear that he didn't intend to kill himself it appeared that he actually intended to escape and that is based on what Lombardo said during the press conference let's go to video three and hear from him I can't tell you so he wouldn't elaborate on that and you know that's understandable considering they're still investigating this yeah it's a it's such a strange feeling until we have some sense of surety and for the person I talked to you that was there she doesn't believe it's ever going to come she's at a point where she doesn't think there will ever be any closure she was shimming she's at the point where on the ground she and others thought that there were multiple shooters like these are people with multiple tours in F you know in in military service saying I just don't believe it's one person so it's right now it is all of that swirling that comes down to people just all we want is an answer yeah that's all we're looking for it is really terrifying that there's the life is beautiful festival that he booked tickets at it's it's interesting to see I read a report that the Austin City Limits told people if you are nervous about your security know that we have the best security that we can you know put into effect but also if you want your money back just that's fine just let us know and they're refunding tickets if people feel uneasy about it they don't want that to be what Happel go and not not to be able to enjoy themselves for obvious reasons yeah I mean yeah I think it's great that they're doing that because I would feel uneasy but at the same time do you let someone like this crazy person change your way of life I mean I again I feel I don't want to go to music festivals right now and also here's another thing that I'm concerned about by talking about this and you have to talk about it as part of the media because the public deserves to know the information this is the largest mass shooting in modern history but at the same time does this give other deranged individuals any ideas I don't know and it's it's a hard it's hard to strike the appropriate balance as a member of the media yeah and you do need to talk about it not just as a member of the media but as a person yeah otherwise you're just gonna bottle it up it's it's nuts like at my house we'll just be in silence playing candy crush for a while and then just kind of sit up and have a new thought and be like what about this what about that you know and it's it's it's really traumatizing the question is will it change my way of life there are changes I think we need to make in the country as a result of this and I mean there has been promising talk in the news about about that actually potentially happening help us build independent media together TYT Network comm
