Peter Fonda's revolting Baron Trump rape threat has a CBC connection and you won't hear about this anywhere in the mainstream media I'm sure by now you've seen the Peter Fonda meltdown about little bear and Trump on Twitter Fonda tweeted that we should rip bear and Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if his mother will stand up against the giant a-hole she is married to so of course Donald Trump jr. had a terrific response sticking up for his 11 year old half-brother he tweeted to Fonda that you're clearly a sick individual and everyone is an Internet badass but rather than attack an eleven-year-old like a bully and coward why don't you pick on someone a bit bigger let me know terrific response to remind everyone that barring Trump is just an 11 year old child and he shouldn't be sucked in to any adult political BS that should have ended right there because yeah it is gross to offer to have an 11 year old child raped even in the Gomorrah of the entertainment industry this should have been too much a bridge too far for anyone to want to jump in on Fonda side but it wasn't I learned that no matter how gross the entertainment industry is there is always some loser who will come along and take it up one more notch somebody named Pat diso replied to Donald Trump jr. saying don't worry we're coming for Chloe too Chloe is Donald Trump juniors three-year-old daughter and this is very clearly either an offer to commit a pedophilic crime against little Chloe firsthand or to take her and stuff her in a cage with pedophiles she's three years old she's a baby what kind of psychopath says these kinds of things well a CBC one apparently here's where it gets interesting who exactly is Patrick dis oh well if you've gone to his LinkedIn page before it got deleted like independent journalist Mike Serna bitch did you find out that diso is from Montreal and he's a comedy writer who won the Canadian Comedy Award for television in best writing in a TV series are special I dug up his IMDB page and it says that he's written five episodes of something called chop chop ninja I don't know what that isn't probably too old or just too interesting for that show he's also worked on 21 episodes of the terribly unfunny Canadian comedy news show the Beaverton likewise another 21 episodes of the life sucking time burglar state broadcaster production this hour has 22 minutes yeah he's a CBC employee you paid this guy this Oh was also worked on the 2015 MuchMusic Video Awards and even adjust for laughs production so I guess when you're sitting at home watching all these shows and you think to yourself these jokes are just so bad and so unfunny and so left-wing they must be written by a crazy person well this is why I was going to go and watch some of the shows that he had written just to see how truly unfunny they really are but I don't hate myself and I have a lot better things to do with my time so after Internet outrage an angry mob of Twitter conservatives and deleting his LinkedIn account to so came back on Twitter to apologize this is his apology I sincerely apologize to Donald Trump jr. and his family for the reckless tweet that I posted earlier today my careless words were mine alone and do not reflect the values or beliefs of any individual or organizations associated with me okay let's just stop right here because this sounds like a big fat sorry that's prompted by a phone call from the CBC or another production that this guy's worked with it feels like a company is forcing him to distance his opinions from them not all that sincere more like professional preservation but let's go on he says overwhelmed by recent events at the u.s. border I let my emotions get the best of me and made a failed totally inappropriate attempt at humor I was wrong and I am truly sorry okay fine normally an apology is good enough for me I don't really need a pound of flesh from people when they say stupid stuff on the internet lord knows I have a lot of us have but let me go back in time just a few days before the rape threat to little Chloe and show you why this apology now is a complete and total insincere pile of garbage and - so is taking all of us for a bunch of idiots let me show you a stack of tweets sent by - so just a few days ago and he doesn't want anybody to see these tweets because he has now deleted his Twitter account in its entirety so on June 14th he sent this tweet to President Donald Trump happy birthday real Donald Trump I hope you die in your sleep tonight but like super painfully and overwhelmed by remorse smiley face then on June 16th he tweeted this about a trump advisor I really need Stephen Miller to die I don't care how I just need him dead we all do then on June 16th the so also tweeted this without hyperbole this is indistinguishable from the Nazis impeachment isn't enough anymore the entire Trump administration should be executed for crimes against humanity do you still believe dis O's apology that this was just a one-time failed joke I mean he's a comedy writer for the CBC so there is no such thing as a one-time failed joke they're probably all failed jokes to some extent when the only buyers for your wit are from the state but that aside in the span of one and a half to two days he wished a Trump advisor dead president Donald Trump dead and then called for the execution of the entire Trump administration and added the assurance that he was serious without her hyperbole at all that he wasn't exaggerating this was his legitimate expression of his wishes and that was all before the raids threat to little Chloe let me just preface my next opinion by saying that I actually don't think this dassault guy is right in the head I really don't I'm not a doctor but I mean how could he be well he obsessed with harming the Trump family he might need a visit from a doctor and then I don't know the secret service so I have a level of compassion for this fellow that he would never have for conservatives like me because it appears he may have some sort of emotional troubles he's not really handling his role in the resistance all that well remember like three weeks ago when Roseanne Barr was a star at the top of her career and then she made a stupid tweet that was arguably racist about a black woman and former Obama senior adviser named Valerie Jarrett Rosen said that if the Muslim Brotherhood and the Planet of the Apes had a baby it would be Valerie Jarrett Roseanne lost her top-rated show in a matter of hours after she apologized for what she explained was an ambien induced bad joke look I'm not defending what Roseanne said I can't defend her tweet but Roseanne didn't offer to have a child raped nor did she express a desire to see several people murdered for purely political reasons here's the thing I don't make the rules about what constitutes outrage and what constitutes compassion when you say stupid things on the Internet the left has made the rules and according to their new rules of war and engagement this guy needs to be Roseanne barred right into oblivion and denounced by everybody that he has ever come in contact with in a professional manner and judging by the leftist timeline this should have probably happened already probably sometime last night the turnaround time here is supposed to be just a matter of a few hours from stupid comment to complete and utter professional ruin for the rest of your life Roseanne lost her show for far less than what DISA has said that's because Roseanne's crime really wasn't racism it was Trump support and how do we know her crime was really Trump support and not just a bad sort of racist joke well because Peter Fonda's new movie is still being released and - so we'll work again writing jokes that nobody laughs at for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read I've taken aim at another CBC employee I've got a brand new book out called the case against David Suzuki and an authorized biography you can download your copy for free at Suzuki book comm but if you want to help me keep my book at the top of the Amazon charts so that everybody knows my book exists you can download it on Amazon for just two dollars and fifty seven cents my book is called the case against David Suzuki and unauthorized biography
