former senator and former governor of Indiana Evan Bayh currently the co-chair of the organization No Labels my friend Brendon Greeley editor of the economic newsletter all we know so far and CNBC contributors this morning Dan Nathan principal of risk reversal and Ron and Sanne dan I go to you first what do you make of this so you know the good cop bad cop thing the problem is there's a lot more bad cops out there right now telling this narrative and that's really to me I think the problem is I think there's very little debate that we need to be tougher with China about trade I think it's the process right now and so when you think about what's going on just in the last couple of weeks with the narrative around this negotiation is that they've sending guys out like Pete Navarro to kind of that with the talking points and the market doesn't like it the market does not like all of this back and forth between the tamp down sort of thing and listen when you think about Larry Kudlow going in there now to be that kind of good cop well that's what Gary Cohen was also meant to do and Gary comes gone now because the president didn't listen to so so when I think about Pete Navarro you know he's kind of like the economics as like Scott Pruett is too science for all intents and purposes you know and so I think they just have a real problem on the messaging front here and they're sending their worst people out there to tell a story the markets doomed outlet if we wanted to get tough on China wouldn't the answer stay in TPP work with a number of other countries to put pressure on China because China deserves that pressure I think this is my problem with the good-cop bad-cop metaphor which is that the bad cop story keeps changing right we had this investigation on whether state support for steel and overcapacity in China was a security risk for the US right and then we shifted to a different investigation on whether they were doing state support for other enterprises right so we're saying different things about China there is a story to be told about Chinese theft of intellectual property there is a story to be told about about Chinese overcapacity and steel right but what we need to be doing is working with all of the other countries that trade with China to figure out how we together work on this the one thing that I will give Peter Navarro credit for I and Donald Trump also is that you know I do wish that anyone else we're conducting this negotiation on our behalf but I wish that any other politician before Donald Trump had made this as much of a priority it is now too late to fix some things that we should been thinking about in 2010 2005 excellent point senator in an op-ed you think that Trump should stay the course and not cower to China's bullying what do you mean that had to do with steel and aluminum Stephanie work that really have been inappropriate trade practices by the Chinese and others for some time but we've now gone way beyond that and what's curious to me is we put ourselves rather than dealing from a position of strength as was said we put ourselves in a position a weakness strategically the way to go about this would have been to enter TPP together our allies our trading partners in Asia to all go to the Chinese and say look you've got to stop this intellectual property theft it's rampant instead we back out of TPP we drive them into the arms of the Chinese and then we pick a fight with the Chinese it really makes no sense the other curious thing is the timing here we may be going into a high-stakes negotiation with the North Koreans over their nuclear program the Chinese hopefully can be instrumental in pressuring the North Koreans to come to the table and to do the right thing and instead we pick a fight with the Chinese so both the timing and the way that this has gone about reflect I think a president who's thinking tactically or living in the moment rather than thinking strategically how best to accomplish our goals in the long run Ron and sana China holds more than a trillion dollars of US debt essentially there our banker don't they have a lot more leverage over us than we realize or maybe the president realizes they do and it is a low probability event that they would dump US Treasuries because it's the economic equivalent of mutually assured destruction however having said that China has come out and said they will fight us to the end on this trade war which they now expect to win all they have to do is stop buying US Treasuries we're borrowing a trillion dollars this year the Fed is not buying Treasuries as it has over the last many years so there are fewer natural buyers for US bonds it's not a question of whether or not the Chinese buy it's at what rate and if those rates go up our debt service goes up if those rates go up housing gets more expensive if those rates go up and the dollar comes down you could have a severe economic dislocation not to mention impact on global economic growth which to date has been strong this is very iris shut the markets move this quickly these are just reps well the president hasn't actually done agree that they're just threats we don't know what they are yeah right from from one day to the next he's coming out and making policy statements the old days minute show me when that guy actually put I understand a bit of clear strategy yes there has been a general frustration with China strategy that is somewhat justified but there hasn't been a clear strategy for the last year and a half on how we're going to go about doing it I agree with Ron I think there's a real problem with Chinese holding of US debt and I'm actually slightly more worried than you are about it which is that when they announced just as a trial balloon China said we're considering stopping buying us listen to me the risk right now is you're saying that these are just threats what is it due to corporate confidence you know we just had this tax bill and we went into 2018 and and by all accounts it looked like the c-suite was pretty bullish right on the global outlook that sort of thing what are we gonna hear when we hear q1 earnings reports over the next few weeks about their their own their own visibility of their businesses one of the cost of inputs are they moving up because people are worried about these sorts of fears so to be and then guys don't forget I mean our GDP is what two thirds consumer spending we've seen some weak retail sales in the last couple months we've seen it at import yeah so it to me this all has the ability to really hurt psychology of the US and there is a real world response a friend of mine from high school who runs an industrial welding company and has very large customers his steel prices his inputs have literally gone up okay 30 yes that exact point President Trump tweeted this morning despite the aluminum tariffs aluminum prices are down four percent people are surprised I'm not lots of money coming into the US coffers and jobs jobs jobs okey doke the price of Midwest premium aluminum has doubled since January in anticipation of tariffs we then saw it's slightly drop in mid-march because of the country exemptions how dangerous is it that the person who's negotiating this has his facts day in and day out wrong and the person I'm talking about mister president is you well obviously it's not an ideal situation when the elders how doesn't have all the facts that may not be interested in getting all the facts that just doesn't have all the facts he's telling the 40-plus million people who follow him things that are wrong there lies well it reminds me of the old Groucho Marx line which is who he gonna believe me or your own eyes leave their own eyes and the point I was going to make stuffy we got an election coming up in November five of the key Senate races which used to be my place of employment are in red state America where President Trump ran very strong big agricultural sector and so if the AG economy soy beans pork producers corn really starts getting hit some of those folks may say you know what maybe we need some checks and balances in Washington maybe we need some restraints on these kind of policies it could have a real effect in some of those key races come November well we're already hearing from it I mean last night Ben Sasse was almost the first one to come out and say hold your horses so we can see cable news commentators say anyone who's against these tariffs doesn't care about America doesn't know what they're talking about I'm pretty sure Ben Sasse Orrin Hatch and last I checked Larry Kudlow do sort of know about this tremendous asses constituents there are different czar already thinking about changing production we've been talking about do markets move on threats or they move on actions markets move on uncertainty area right so we've created this uncertainty if farmers farmers have to figure out how to hedge this right now because that's what you have to do if you need to figure out what to plan for next season but to that exact point you did not see CEOs spend even though they had massive amounts of money on their balance sheet during the Obama administration because they were worried about the regulatory overhang they're now spending because they're saying it's the regulation time it's tax cut time will that change now that they're dealing with a skittish president well I think so I mean listen you know just the jobs report today kind of highlights the fact of just how tenuous the situation is when you think about exporters right to China if that all of a sudden they're gonna have less demand for their products then they're not going to be hiring and I think it's really important make those capital investment or maybe yes and you know I don't know if you guys listen to the New York Times The Daily yesterday they interviewed a farmer who voted for did a Donald Trump in Illinois and he's really worried you know how much what percent of his crop of soybeans and corn goes to China he said between 70 and 90 percent as a massive issue here so like that constituency is already starting to think twice about the worst case scenario of their vote from 2016 when people watch President Trump lead a roundtable on tax reform and he starts with this that's not entertainment concerning for people apology that points to the larger problem that I would even go so far to mildly disagree with with a good senator that this is not even tactical this is not thought out in any way shape or form we have a dispute settlement mechanism within the World Trade Organization that should be addressed first we have a variety of means to engage the Chinese even if it's not to the president's liking to go about a process that ultimately could lead to us imposing tariffs but in a rational way hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on
