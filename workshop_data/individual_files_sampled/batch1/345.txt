burning the Israeli flag Palestinians protests again along the Gaza Israel border hundreds have been shot more than 30 kills by Israeli soldiers but the protesters say they'll continue until May 15th the 70th anniversary of Israel's creation what can they achieve this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm fully battable for a third consecutive Friday thousands of Palestinians have been protesting at the Gaza Israel border demanding they be allowed back to the lands they were forced from the so called great march of return has entered its third weekend it will continue until May 15th the day Palestinians call the Nakba or catastrophe when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced in the conflicts that culminated in the creation of Israel in 1948 Friday's protest was labeled the lifting of the flag of Palestine and the burning of the flag of Israel in five different locations Israeli flags were burnt down in Palestinian Flags who were hoisted in their places and at a protest camp near the border a large Israeli flag was faced on the ground for demonstrators to walk on more than 30 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces since the protests began on March 30th these are the Palestinian health ministry figures the deaths include three children and one journalist more than 3,000 people wounded 1,200 of them shot with live ammunition while 300 were hurt by rubber-coated steel bullets now despite the violence Palestinians say they will not give up their protests Harry Fawcett has more from the Gaza Israel border the numbers of casualties have been very high over the last couple of weeks hundreds of people have been shot and injured more than 30 killed we've been speaking to some of the young men and boys who are preparing to approach the fence again in the face of those risks some of them saying that it's their right to do so that it is their land we even spoke to one young man who has who had massive injuries in one leg from the protests which came after The Donald Trump's declaration on recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he is back here he says that he has nothing else to do that he wants to come here and show that people here in Gaza like everywhere around the world want to live in a decent way and not in this constant state of conflict and essentially imprisonment in Gaza under the Israeli blockade and what is only a limited lifting of the southern border with Egypt so that situation here the Israelis have also released a statement saying that they are trying to counteract what they say Hamas instigated violent confrontations bent on trying to sabotage the what they call the security fence and they say wouldn't your country do the same Israel's foreign ministry tweeted early on Friday about the protest saying Hamas is preparing to initiate another violent confrontation today on the Israel Gaza fence Israel will continue to defend its borders and its citizens your country would do the same well let's bring in our guests for today's inside story in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank is Mustafa Barghouti he's the secretary-general of the Palestinian national initiative and a former Palestinian information minister in Jerusalem Mitchell Barak political commentator and former adviser to the former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon and here in Doha with me beverly milton edwards a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and author of the book the palestinian-israeli conflict a people's war thank you all for being on inside story I appreciate your time today if I can start with you Mustafa Barghouti in Ramallah as we head towards May the 15th what is it that Palestinians are trying to achieve with these demonstrations what is the endgame it's a simple message we the people who have been under Israeli military occupation for 51 years we the Palestinians who have been displaced from our homeland since 70 years are demanding our rights and are demanding to be free from occupation and from the apartheid system and we are reaffirming the right of the return for the Palestinian refugees which was affirmed by UN resolutions and by international law but also it is a way that Palestinians are also expressing their rejection of the administration of the administration of President Trump decision about moving their embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Jerusalem as a capital of Israel do you feel that anything has been achieved at all in these past I think three things have been achieved very clearly first of all this is a reflection of an amazing Palestinian unity regardless of the internal political division about the form of struggle we should use which is peaceful nonviolent resistance we've been calling for that for 16 years I'm so proud and so happy that all the factions without without exception are now committed to nonviolent peaceful resistance as the best form of struggle for Palestinians that's one second it's bringing back the attention to the Palestinian issue which was marginalized and ignored for a very long time but third it is exposing Israel as a country that claims to be democratic but it is using lethal weapons using lethal hive high-velocity bullets against peaceful demonstrators so far 1,400 Palestinian non-violent demonstrators protesters were shocked by Israeli army not only in Gaza by the way also in the West Bank today they shot several people in Ramallah as well as it has exposed the fact that Israel is violating international law and I think anybody who read the most recent articles in Washington Post and New York Times realizes that now Israel is exposed and it is not a democratic country and it's not a country that respects human rights ok let's hear from Mitchell Barak in Jerusalem I saw you Mitchell shaking your head there while Mustafa Barghouti was speaking these demonstrations some would say have been an effective strategy from the Palestinians to show Israel's heavy-handed response in dealing with protesters how does Israel justify a shooting these unarmed protesters these women and children who were protesting near the border fence mm-hmm yeah why don't you just bring the whole school load of bus children to the border and behind them you know hide some Hamas terrorists because Hamas is actually organizing these and you know then ask why doesn't Israel let just let them cut the fence and cross the border and there are people you know who are preparing weapons meaning I don't know the New York Times mr. Berger but I just read the New York Times article and it said that yes that most of the demonstrators were peaceful and next to the peaceful demonstrators are the women and children there were people you know preparing gasoline bombs you know I call these the Guns and Roses demonstration most of the people are coming with roses but a lot of them are coming with guns and weapons and they've said they want to cut the fence they want to come into Israel and they have an appetite for destruction and that's a real problem so if you want to talk about this promotion if nobody comes moral force you're talking about a you know a barbed wire you're talking about a barbed wire fence and smart fences which is not made for a rush of thousands of poor people who do it it's not a concrete when in the Israeli army and the Israeli political leadership and I didn't interrupt you mr. Barr guchi I didn't interrupt you when the Israeli army and the political leadership from the defense minister to the Communist day peaceful demonstrations fine but if the terrorists are going to be involved and terrorists are gonna come and try and rush the border and try and rush the border and cross the border of a sovereign nation they will be met with li lethal force it's not as if Israel is firing indiscriminately on 30,000 demonstrators let's allow Mustafa Barghouti to respond before I bring in Beverly Milton Edwards here in Doha Mustafa Barghouti Israeli officials as Mitchell Baraka said they have accused Hamas of being behind these protests saying that the movement is deliberately exposing women and children to danger by telling them to go near this border friends it says the protests are basically a new tactic by Hamas to conduct so-called terror operations against Israel what is your response to this is Hamas behind this protest movement know all the Palestinian groups are participating in these demonstrations not Hamas only everybody second they are all peaceful nobody carried a single guy raised these terrorists and unimportance those those people shut up shut up and let me finish Gaza in the buffer and mr. Vargo dua you interrupted me you interrupt finish please Mitchell Barak and let's try to be civil here in our conversation the most important yeah the most important thing that happened is that the people who were shot the 1,400 people who were shot with live ammunitions were shot inside Gaza because Israel is imposing what they call a buffer zone which the width of which is no less than 800 meters inside Gaza and anybody who enters there they shot they shoot him these people most of them were not shot at the borders they were should shot inside Gaza and by the way today in Ramallah we had a peaceful demonstration and we were shot at and a foreign journalist was hit in the head by an Israeli sniper we we were also shot at in Ramallah he wants to say now that Hamas is moving us this is incorrect the reality is it is unacceptable for any country for any army in the world to shoot civilian demonstrators with live ammunition and that's exactly what Israel is doing and that's Israel exactly what the Israeli army leaders have admitted they said in their statement we knew every shot we knew who was shot we knew where every bullet landed that means they are admitting that they have committed war crimes okay Mitchell Barr I'll let you respond but let me just bring in Beverly Milton Edwards to the conversation first I would allow you to respond to what Mustafa Barghouti has said in just a moment but I want to hear from Beverly on what's been happening in the this region in the Gaza Israel border these past three weeks the protests are now entering their third week Mustafa Barghouti says something positive has come out of this because it has shown that Palestinian people are stepping up and as expose Israel he says what do you think these protests have shown has anything positive come out of it for the Palestinians well I think that as both our commentators have have have pointed out really rather expressively what what this is all showing is the depth of emiti between Palestinians and Israelis and that really the dead end of peace politics seeing this you know evidentially through these protests protests which are about one of the major issues for conflict resolution between Israel and the Palestinians a peace process that would if it was resolved deliver security to both sides to Israel and to the palace to the Palestinians so the positive is as mr. Ferber Guti pointed out is that the issue of the conditions of Palestinians particularly in Gaza and the plight of Palestinians in Gaza has really been brought to the forefront of of the international audience so to speak and Israel itself has made a point over the last few months of pointing out how significantly bad the conditions in Gaza have become humanitarian organizations have been reporting that the situation is becoming unsustainable the IMF the World Bank have noted that the places on that Gaza is on the brink of collapse 90 percent of the water is undrinkable 60 percent of the youth are unemployed which is one of the highest rates of unemployment in the region three maximum of four to six hours of electricity a day and in fact the Gaza power plants shut down yesterday so I mean this highlights that whether that's a positive it's it's a positive of negatives but I think as the same more significantly and as both our commentators are really you know symbolizing here is is that what we're in dead-end politics right and as we heard from from both our commentators there Beverly the Palestinians say these protests are nonviolent civilian-led Israel says Hamas is behind all this I'm curious to know who's winning the public opinion battle right now if you will it's been what three weeks now who among in the international community who is attracting the most sympathy right now well I think there are wins for both sides and we have to be realistic about that so I mean Israel has deployed its media effort I mean we can see that through and the role in their role that there's playing in the international press through social media if you look at the IDF spokesman or if you look at the coordinator for gazar Affairs and you can see that there's a very fulsome response in terms of trying to maintain support and and and win over win over new supporters and if you look at commentary on Twitter you'll see that there are an awful lot of people behind Israel and most importantly of course for the Israeli government is is that that Israelis themselves are behind their own government and what their own government is doing on that border with with Gaza right for Palestinians yes what we have seen is evidence of a cumulative effect and that there are protests marches being organized for example in Europe in the UK and also in Washington and again that there's social media activism that links this issue this issue of the plight of Gazans of refugee herds to wider debates in particular amongst youth activists as well let me bring in Mitchell Barak in Jerusalem once again Mitchell we've seen in this past week Israeli authorities target Hamas operatives allege Hamas operatives I should say in their positions in Gaza are these Israeli attacks meant to attract and draw Hamas further into confrontation so that perhaps Israel can deal decisively with these protests and can justify its excessive use of force against these protesters again I you know we debate first of all I think that professor Milton Edwards spoke very eloquently and correctly and many of the things she said and one thing that I would like to highlight is for Israelis we've not only been saying for months we've been saying for years just like we've been complaining for years about the civilian slaughter in Syria what Israelis don't want a humanitarian crisis Israelis don't want to deny people freedoms Israelis don't like when children are starving and when there's no electricity so don't want that why they've located the Gaza Strip well it's it's it's it's very simple it's a sick it's a security issue for the most part meaning remember let's go back 12 years Israel there were Israeli settlements in Gaza Israeli prime minister and I worked in the Prime Minister's Office for Ariel Sharon when he declared it I said is Israel's gonna leave Gaza and it almost tore this country apart because there are a lot of people that didn't want to do that because we don't need to be there now in the 12 years that the Hamas or the Palestinian leadership has been in charge of Gaza what have we seen there we've seen more hunger more destruction the blockades are related to the tunnels meaning it's nice to let concrete go in and building materials but if buildings are not getting built and tunnels are getting built to launch terror attacks against Israel that's a problem but there are thousands and thousands and thousands of tons of supplies coming in every month so it's not an issue so yes there are certain things that are blockaded but but they're also smuggling tunnels and tunnels where terrorists eventually you're not denying that you know Israelis it's only a security issue it's a security issue oh oh for sure of course there's suffering it's terrible okay it's it's a terrible situation and and I believe that the Palestinian people let me just say this I believe the Palestinian people who are living in Gaza they deserve better and a lot of those people coming to the protests are coming out of frustration and they deserve a better leadership than the terrorist organization that has they have elected who thinks that getting what they want is burning an Israeli flag and continuing call for the entire destruction of the State of Israel you know when when most of our goudi started his comments and said what he did chief he sounded very logical and pledged well said here's our claims against Israel okay so you don't need to burn tires to do that which is a horrible you know situation of people getting smoke inhalation you don't need to charge the border you don't need to throw Molotov cocktails over the border you don't have the right then you don't have to call for the destruction okay the State of Israel and the annihilation of every last Jew major why would you have the table in the end of the day that's how it's gonna work and okay miss Mustafa Barghouti yours well not enough well first of all of course the Israelis like to keep claiming that they are victims in this conflict but let's look at the facts during the last three weeks not a single Israeli was injured 31 Palestinians were killed by Israeli snipers including a journalists including including people who were providing first what wasn't that journalist a member of the 1080 journalist apart can you can you not interrupt me can you shut up a second I did not interrupt you don't interrupt me is practicing yeah but please don't let him interrupt me please I respected him I did he shouldn't he should respect me I don't interrupt Ezreal is practicing okay Israel is practicing state terrorism because it is bombarding Palestinians it is occupying Palestinians you cannot equate between Palestinians and Israelis this is unacceptable because one side is occupying the other one side is oppressing the other the Israeli side is practicing a system of apartheid against Palestinians I have met so many foreign ministers and so many journalists from in the world and they have always been telling us why don't you use the Martin Luther King strategy why don't you March and thousands demanding your rights that's exactly what we are doing why is he upset because we convinced Hamas not to use military weapons and except and Hamas accepted to use our method of nonviolent resistance he's angry because it is exposing Israel which is by the way the never left Gaza Israel is still occupying Gaza I'll tell you why because Israel is imposing a buffer zone inside Gaza 24 percent of Gaza is prohibited for Gosselin's who are two million people living in 140 square miles Israel is booting Gaza under siege that's why people in Gaza don't have electricity that's why people in Gaza don't have clean water that's why people in Gaza cannot have work and are unemployed Israel is having a siege on Gaza for 12 years Israelis shooting fishermen who are trying to fish in the sea if they go beyond six miles into the sea okay what kind of withdrawal is that it is not all Israeli still occupying Gaza and still operates in Gaza in the West again we were shot today in Ramallah yes nothing Gaza by the Israeli army I just want to pick up a point about the Palestinian journalist who was killed last week by these railey security forces during the demonstrations Mitchell Barak you said he was shot because Israel believes he's an a mass operative but this is a journey who had been vetted by the US State Department who had been given a grant by the United States and who was wearing a pressed a vest with the words press written on it how do they justify killing him I don't know you'll have to ask the Israeli Ministry of Defense that came out with his Hamas membership card okay they released a statement the city's a member of Hamas so you know I I understand you know the frustration but to say there are no casualties on the Israeli side of course not because you have thousands of people or within a group of tens of thousands of people trying to rush a secured sovereign border of a country what do you think is gonna happen you think our side is gonna take losses of course not because we're sitting by and that side is rushing the fence okay and when you do that and when you try and cut the fence and when you try and and and really border and is really we should do harm it is really I made this point before let's try and move the discussion a bit forward and I want to bring back Beverly into the conversation Beverly what do you see that Israel fears the most today is it these unarmed Palestinian protesters is that the Palestinian factions Hamas what is it that Israel is so scared of Israel which has one of the most sophisticated armies in the world I think that Israel is concerned at the moment with both its southern border which is where these protests from Gaza are arising from and the momentum is only going to build and the Israeli defense and intelligence establishment will be well aware of this and planning for that for their responses but Israel also is concerned with what's happening on its northern border and particularly with Syria and and and what the Western retaliation may be and the ways in which that might cause a domino effect on and draw Israel Israel in I think that actually within the defense and intelligence establishment there's there's little fear and the reason why I suggest this is that and within the defense and intelligence establishment there's everybody knows the rules of the game for example Hamas by and large has respected the sea fire that was achieved in the wake of the 2014 war and if anything Hamas has acted as a bulwark against wider security concerns for the Gaza border with Egypt and the Sinai which also matters to Israel particularly in terms of preventing a proliferation of groups like Isis or al-qaeda so I think the fear is expressed by political leaders in Israel and understandably so because it plays on wider memories of the effects of the conflict front from Gaza several years ago just briefly yes the protests are expected to continue until May the 15th just a few days before that I think two days before that the American Embassy is supposed to be opening in Jerusalem how much of an explosive situation could we be looking at in the weeks ahead look I think we we all need to understand that this will be a touchstone issue we're talking about generation Hope hopelessness here we're talking about a generation of young Palestinians who formed the majority of the population in the West Bank and Gaza in East Jerusalem who have known nothing other than the conflict with that with their neighbor not only that but we see from leaders elsewhere in the region for example king abdullah ii of jordan has time and time again emphasized with with the americans that this is such a wrong move this sends out the wrong signals in terms of what should have been a stated to aim to create peace in the Middle East thank you so much Beverly we'll leave it with that unfortunately we've run out of time thank you for a very interesting discussion a heated one I must say and I'm sure we'll be talking about this issue again in the coming weeks here on al-jazeera Thank You Mustafa Barghouti Mitchell Barak and Beverly Milton Edwards and thank you as well for watching you can always watch this program again by visiting our
