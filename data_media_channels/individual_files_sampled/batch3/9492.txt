SPEAKER PAUL RYAN WHO IS RETIRING AT THE END TO HAVE GETTING DEATH THREATS AND SHUTDOWN OF SOCIAL MEDIA ALL FOR SERVING ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS OVER THE WEEKEND, WHY CAN'T WE BE CIVIL TO LEADERS ANYMORE, JOINING TO DEBATE IS REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS CHRIS AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS ROCHELLE RICHIE, THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. GUYS, HERE WE ARE HAVING THE CONVERSATION AGAIN, CHRIS, DO YOU SEE END IN SIGHT? I HAVE NO IDEA, I MEAN, WE HAVE COME TO THE POINT THROWING A WOMAN OUT OF A RESTAURANT GOING TO EAT POLITICALLY WHO THE GUEST IS GOING TO BE AND NOW SORT OF BACKTRACK AND DEAL WITH THEIR BUSINESS, DOESN'T SEEM LIKE FREE SPEECH TO ME, SEEMS LIKE IT'S RIDICULOUS AND MEAN MESSAGE TO BE SENDING? TOWARDS LEADERS HAVE BECOME NEW NORMAL THEN WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE COMMANDER IN TWEET, DONALD TRUMP, I MEAN JUST LAST WEEK HE INSULTED JEFF SESSIONS SAYING THAT HE WAS SCARCE STIFF AND MISSING IN ACTION. JILLIAN: THAT'S NOT CONFRONTING SOMEONE IN A RESTAURANT AND MAKING PEOPLE WELL, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FROM WHAT HAPPENED SESSIONS. JILLIAN: ON SOCIAL MEDIA. YES, ON SOCIAL MEDIA, SHE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING DEATH THREATS FOR IT, WHAT I'M SAYING THIS HAS BECOME THE NEW NORMAL, DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS ATTACKED JEFF SESSIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA N MARCH HE CALLED HIM DISGRACEFUL AND CALLED JUSTICE JILLIAN: CHRIS, DON'T YOU SEE HURTING DEMOCRATS AT SOME POINT? I AGREE IT'S PETTY, ERIC HOLDER PRIORITY DURING TENURE SERVING PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS TO FOCUS ON LEGAL RIGHTS FOR TERRORISTS TRYING TO SECURE THEM, LOOK AT RAHM EMMANUEL WHO SUPPRESSED THE KILLING OF BLACK TEEN SO HE COULD BE ELECTED. BERNIE SANDERS WANTS TO GET FREE HEALTH CARE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS, THROW WOMEN OUT OF A RESTAURANT, ROCHELLE YOU HAVE TO HELP OUT YOUR PARTY, WHO CARES ABOUT TWEETS, YOU KNOW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO INSULT PEOPLE, HE'S INSULTED FBI, MEMBERS OF THE FBI JUST THIS WEEK CALLING THEM CLOWNS AND LOSERS AND BROUGHT UP ACTUALLY PAYING OFF HIS INFIDELITIES. JILLIAN: ROCHELLE, SMS SOMETHING THAT HAS THIS IS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S INSANE. SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN RECENT MONTHS. WHY ARE YOU SEPARATING FAMILIES? JILLIAN: WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE THIS IS AFFECTING EVERYDAY BUSINESS OWNERS. I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE RESTAURANTS WHERE SOME OF THE THINGS ARE HAPPENING, LIKE F PEOPLE ARE AFRAID WHEN THEY SEE STUFF LIKE THIS HAPPENING, ROCHELLE? IT'S UNFORTUNATE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT REMINDS ME WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING IN CIVIL RIGHTS ERA WHERE AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE BEING HARASSED DURING SIT-INS, I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE HARASSED WHILE EATING DINNER, AGAIN, FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IT WAS A PHOTO, BUT I THINK THE FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP HAS A GREAT CAMPAIGN, THE BE BEST CAMPAIGN AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL APPLY TO DAILY LIVES AND WE SHOULD START WITH HER HUSBAND. JILLIAN: CHRIS, FINAL WORD. I AGREE WITH ROCHELLE ON THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S SAFETY, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE DISCOURSE THAT WE DO, BUT THE PRESIDENT IS A TOUGH AND SORT OF GAMES WHERE HE IS PUT ON ECONOMY SUP AND OTHER THINGS ARE DISCOURSE THING.
