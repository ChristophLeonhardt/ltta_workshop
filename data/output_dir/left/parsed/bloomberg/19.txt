The design of the modern tennis racket goes
back to England in 1874
and a man named Major Walter Clopton Wingfield.
Wingfield patented the rules for a game known
as lawn tennis,
standardising elements like balls, nets and rackets.
For the next century rackets would be made
of wood and remain similar in shape to Wingfield's
original design.
But in 1961 French tennis legend Rene Lacoste
unveiled a radical invention.
"The Crocodile" - as he was nicknamed - had
made a prototype using metal.
Just a few years later Wilson released the
T-2000, the first stainless steel racket whose
futuristic design caught the eye of players
like Billie Jean King and Jimmy Connors.
Its small head and open throat reduced air
resistance and helped Connors win the US Open
5 times.
The 1970s ushered in an era of aluminium which
was lighter and easier to mould than steel.
This was followed by fashionable oversized
racquets that had a larger sweet spot and
gave players more power.
Eventually the quest for lightness and durability
led to graphite rackets as well as other materials
like kevlar and graphene.
Today Wilson and French brand Babolat dominate
both the men’s and women’s game with the
two brands winning 71% of professional tournaments
in 2017.
Precise and powerful this is the design that’s
helped to create legends with every stroke.
