1
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,098
ARE MEASURES THE DEMOCRATS WILL

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:05,099
POST.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,768
>> LOTS CHANGING EVEN AT THIS

4
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:08,102
MOMENT.

5
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,970
JOINING ME NOW, ONE OF THE POT

6
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,074
DOWN LIKE A CONGRESSMAN WHO JUST

7
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:16,877
MET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

8
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:17,645
MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR

9
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:17,945
TIME.

10
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:19,713
WE KNOW YOU JUST SPENT A FEW

11
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:20,514
MOMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT.

12
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:23,584
WHAT WAS HE THINKING STAYING IN

13
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:24,118
THAT MEETING?

14
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:26,320
WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT?

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,689
>> HE'S VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND

16
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:29,690
OPTIMISTIC.

17
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,993
HE EXPRESSED IN HIS WORDS, I AM

18
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,328
1000% BEHIND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

19
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:35,896
TO PASS IN THE HOUSE.

20
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,698
THERE WILL BE TWO BILLS GOING TO

21
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:40,301
THE FLOOR ON THURSDAY.

22
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,435
THE McCALL GOODLATTE BILL, THE

23
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:44,772
ORIGINAL VERSION AND THEN THE

24
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:45,439
MODIFIED VERSION.

25
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,374
BOTH ARE VERY SIMILAR IN TERMS

26
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:49,009
OF THE FOUR PILLARS, BORDER

27
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,511
SECURITY THAT THE PRESIDENT

28
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:53,113
WANTS AND BOTH PROVIDE FOR A

29
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:54,114
DACA FIX.

30
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:55,516
ON THIS ISSUE OF FAMILY

31
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:57,117
SEPARATION, IT ALSO ADDRESSES

32
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,319
THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IT WILL

33
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,486
DETAIN THE FAMILY AS A UNIT

34
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:02,957
RATHER THAN SEPARATE THEM OUT.

35
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:04,325
>> Sandra: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

36
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,525
FIND OUT IT ISN'T A FAMILY

37
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,861
MEMBER OR A PARENT THAT'S

38
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,562
TRAVELING OVER THE BORDER WITH

39
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:11,298
THAT CHILD?

40
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,033
>> THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM,

41
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:14,668
WE'VE NEGLECTED THE BORDER IN

42
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:17,104
THIS CRISIS.

43
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,806
IN 2014 WE HAD 20 MILLION OF

44
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:20,507
THESE CHILDREN CROSSING AND IT

45
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:22,710
ENTICED THEM TO COME OVER.

46
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,111
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF FRAUDULENT

47
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:24,511
PARENTS.

48
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,246
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN THEIR

49
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:28,782
PARENTS SAYING THEY ARE THE

50
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:29,116
PARENTS.

51
00:01:29,116 --> 00:01:30,484
UNDER THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY,

52
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:31,652
THE PARENTS ARE NOW BEING

53
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:32,786
PROSECUTED BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO

54
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:35,689
SEE THE FAMILY STAY TOGETHER AND

55
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,891
NOT SEPARATED.

56
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:38,659
BUT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY

57
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,027
FROM MY POSITION AS THE CHAIRMAN

58
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:41,695
OF HOMELAND SECURITY IS TO HAVE

59
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:42,930
A BORDER SECURITY BILL PASSED

60
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,131
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE PAST

61
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:48,302
THE SECURE FENCE ACT IN 2006.

62
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:51,705
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

63
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:53,707
IT ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES

64
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:54,375
IMMIGRATION TO A MERIT-BASED

65
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,111
SYSTEM RATHER THAN A RANDOM

66
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,112
LOTTERY SYSTEM OR CHAIN

67
00:01:58,112 --> 00:01:58,512
MIGRATION.

68
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:01,982
>> Sandra: HOW WOULD SUCCESS

69
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:08,689
BE MEASURED ULTIMATELY, IT BEING

70
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:11,191
PASSED ON THE PRESIDENT SIGNS

71
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:11,892
IT.

72
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:13,494
AND I THINK METRICS ARE

73
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:14,595
IMPORTANT IN OPERATION CONTROL

74
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:15,496
OF THE BORDER.

75
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,164
YOU CAN'T QUANTIFY THAT IN TERMS

76
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:20,300
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ILLEGALLY

77
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,135
ENTERING THE COUNTRY.

78
00:02:21,135 --> 00:02:23,871
THE FACT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

79
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,072
THESE LEGAL LOOPHOLES, AND IN

80
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:26,140
THE BEGINNING WHEN TRUMP THE

81
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,509
RHETORIC ABOUT THE WALL AND

82
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,511
SUCH, THE NUMBERS WENT WAY DOWN.

83
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:32,513
THE PROBLEM IS WE KNOW THAT WAS

84
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:33,280
RHETORIC AND CONGRESS HAS TO

85
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,582
CHANGE THE LAWS IN THE LEGAL

86
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:37,885
LOOPHOLES, OTHERWISE IF THEY

87
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:39,119
COME, THEY CAN STAY.

88
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,221
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT THE

89
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:41,922
SMUGGLERS AND TRAFFICKERS ARE

90
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:45,125
SELLING TO THESE VICTIMS AT THE

91
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,894
PRICE OF $6,000 PER PERSON

92
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:48,295
BRINGING THEM INTO THE COUNTRY.

93
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:50,364
WE WILL NEVER STOP THIS PROBLEM

94
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:54,635
UNTIL WE DRY UP THE DETERRENT

95
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:55,703
ISSUE AND THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES

96
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:57,304
THAT EXISTED.

97
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:58,338
>> Sandra: MR. CHAIRMAN, I

98
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,106
DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT

99
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:06,280
EMOTIONS ARE HIGH THIS WEEK.

100
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,682
AND, WHEN YOU LOOK ON AT THAT

101
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:12,086
AND YOU SEE THE DISGUST FROM THE

102
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:17,891
AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND WHAT IS

103
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,093
BEING LEFT OUT OF THIS

104
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,095
CONVERSATION BASED ON WHAT YOU

105
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:22,629
SEE EVERY DAY?

106
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:24,832
>> I'VE BEEN DOWN TO THE

107
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:28,302
DETENTION CENTERS, AND IT IS ON

108
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:34,174
A HUMAN LEVEL, IT IS A VERY

109
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:34,541
DIFFICULT.

110
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:38,479
BUT AGAIN, IT WILL CONTINUE TO

111
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,882
KEEP GOING ON AND ON UNTIL WE

112
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:42,983
FIX OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

113
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:45,319
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO

114
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,088
ON THURSDAY, IN ADDITION TO

115
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:48,489
FIXING DACA.

116
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,091
I HOPE THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO

117
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:52,226
WORK WITH US TO FIX THE

118
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:56,730
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES ISSUE.

119
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,700
>> DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD

120
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,067
PREFER TO?

121
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:05,339
>> I THINK SO.

122
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:10,544
WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY THAT

123
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:11,245
IS HISTORIC TO FIX BOTH THE

124
00:04:11,245 --> 00:00:00,000
SECURITY ISSUE AND OF THE DACA
