and that news came on top of this bombshell report in The Wall Street Wall Street Journal this afternoon that a man named Alan Wizzle Berg has been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York the federal grand jury that is considering the criminal investigation into the president's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen now the Michael Cohen case big picture it's still basically one big open question in terms of what kind of legal trouble might lie ahead for the President himself if his longtime attorney Michael Cohen who apparently taped his conversations with President Trump among other things whether he's ultimately criminally charged by federal prosecutors in New York we still don't know if that's going to be an issue for the President himself we still don't know how that is all going to play out everybody's watching that of course very closely but with this guy if Alan weiselberger has been subpoenaed if this report in The Wall Street Journal this afternoon is Right that honestly has way bigger implications than just the case against Michael Cohen Alan Wisel Berg is not a household name but he is in the Trump household he's in his 70s he has worked for the Trump family his entire adult life he started off working for the president's father I believe in the 1970s he has been at the Trump Organization apparently since its inception he's known to be not only a very trusted very senior figure in the Trump Organization he's also been directly involved in a number of financial dealings related to the president and his business that have since come under legal scrutiny for example mr. Wisel Berg is said to have been personally involved in the payments to women who alleged that they had affairs with President Trump according to The Wall Street Journal Allen weiselberger was also close enough to the president and his family that he was the one who handled their household expenditures personal expenditures and purchases for mr. Trump and his family including mr. Trump's dealings with various banks mr. Wisel Berg is the treasurer of the Donald J Trump Foundation which of course has just come under very aggressive legal scrutiny in New York State Allen weiselberger is such an important and senior figure in the president's business empire that when the president announced that he was handing off day-to-day control of his business now that he's president the common shorthand we use for that transaction is to say the president handed over control of his business to his two sons Don jr. and Eric but actually the group he handed over control of his business to is his two sons Don jr. and Eric but also Alan Wisel Berg Alan Weissenberg is the linchpin of all Trump financial matters not incidentally mr. Russell Berg is also reported to have been personally responsible for preparing Donald Trump's tax returns for years oh if he has now been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York that is potentially a very big deal we know that the president has been particularly sensitive even particularly emotional around investigators and even the press pushing too hard when it comes to his personal finances and the finances around his business Alan weiselberger has been subpoenaed before a federal grand jury in New York that is the kind of thing that is likely to push the president's buttons hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
