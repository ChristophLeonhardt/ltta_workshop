and Germany's seen a huge increase interrelated court cases so much so in fact that the Federal prosecutor's office is hiring an additional two thousand judges just to deal with the increase is the mr. elated cases in particular have increased fivefold since last year with the last two months witnessing an especially large surge accounting for one in every three cases this year without joined live by dr. Reiner Roth first your political analyst and consultant thanks for joining us sir good to have you on the program today now a Germany as we said earlier it's seen a major spike interrelated court cases do you think the numbers likely to grow even more well the increase has been so sharp that we have to expect that it will not stop at this level and an increase by fivefold rate is really alarming it's an alarming development and it shows that German authorities have not only been prepared to protect the borders against immigrants of which they're natural they're the the political and ideological nature was not known it is also not possible really to handle all the terrorist related cases that have sprung up so sharply now in 2017 we understand because of this increase the prosecutor's office is actually sending some of those terror lighted cases to regional courts do you think this situation could risk perhaps overwhelming those regional judges I mean they're not used to handling these kinds of cases there's not enough judges at a high federal level here I mean is the system actually coping do you think well the regional courts are not prepared for such cases and therefore it is not a real satisfying solution it can only help to stretch the time a little bit to find and also train more churches for such specific cases bus but as we have said before it has to be expected that more cases will come up also in the future and it is also known to German authorities that the increase of numbers of Salafi extremists for example was it was 10% last year alone or the ending year alone and so we have to expect that also in the future the radicalization tendencies that we see in Sunni Islam here in Germany will keep and it's interesting to note that it's mainly Sunni extremism that is concerned here in these cases it's not shiite extremism so we see that it's just those groups that german government and also the nato allies have been collaborating with to spike the war against assad in syria so this seems to hit back now also on germany this is coming on the back of new talks isn't it between these social democrats and the the christian democrats i mean do you think this issue will be on the table terrorism was an issue in the the election is this something that will be discussed do you think well as citizens definitely will expect this but it seems that the negotiations for the new coalition take much too long the citizens are already wondering when we will have a new government if there will be new elections so Germany seems to be a little bit paralyzed on several levels and specifically in this issue of Islamic extremism and the related cases in court all right dr. Reiner Roth first Jew political analyst and consultant banks for your take on that situation here today Oh naughty
