Tucker: YOU HAVE WAITED ALL WEEK. TIME FOR FINAL EXAM, WHERE THE BEST INFORMED PEOPLE IN THE NEWS BUSINESS SIT ACROSS FROM ONE ANOTHER AT A SET TO DETERMINE WHO IS THE BEST INFORMED PERSON IN THE NEWS BUSINESS. THIS WEEK'S CONTESTANTS, KRISTIN FISHER AND THE HOST OF SPECIAL REPORT, BRET BAIER. NOW, YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER MISS AN EPISODE, YOU KNOW THE RULES. FOR VIEWERS JUST TUNING IN I'LL REPEAT THEM. BUZZERS, I ASK THE QUESTION, THE FIRST ONE TO BUZZ IN GETS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. MUST WAIT UNTIL I FINISH ASKING THE QUESTION TO ANSWER IT. CAN YOU ANSWER ONCE I ACKNOWLEDGE YOU BY SAYING YOUR NAME. EACH CORRECT ANSWER WORTH ONE POINT, EVERY INCORRECT DETRACTS A POINT, BEST OF FIVE WINS. MAKES SENSE. WE'RE READY. Tucker: GOOD LUCK. THE ART WORLD WAS STUNNED THIS WEEK WHEN A PAINTING BY THE GRAFFITI ARTIST WAS SOLD AT AUCTION. SOMETHING ODD HAPPENED, ONCE THE GAVEL CAME DOWN, WHAT WAS IT. Tucker: BRET BAIER. NO ONE BID. Tucker: NO ONE BID. DID NO ONE BID ON THE FAMOUS GRAFFITI ARTIST BANKSY? TO THE TAPE. THIS WORK OF ART IS BEING SHREDDED, THEY SAY IT ADDS ABOUT 50% TO THE VALUE. THAT IS QUITE A BRILLIANT THING. Tucker: THAT IS A PRANK. BUT ALL RIGHT. QUESTION TWO. THAT SAYS SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT BOTH OF YOU, YOU AREN'T WATCHING ART AUCTIONS DURING THE DAY. YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. IN IS A MULTIPLE CHOICE WE. SINGER TAYLOR SWIFT HAS BECOME POLITICAL AS YOU KNOW, URGING HER FANS TO VOTE AGAINST TENNESSEE REPUBLICAN MARCIA BLACKBURN NEXT MONTH. THE PRESIDENT RESPONDED BY SAYING OF SWIFT, ONE OF THREE THINGS. WAS IT, A, TAYLOR SWIFT IS OVERRATED. B, I LIKE HER MUSIC LESS NOW. OR, C, LOCK HER UP. B. HE LIKES HER 25% LESS. Tucker: I THOUGHT IT WAS LOCK HER UP. TO THE TAPE. MARCIA BLACKBURN IS DOING A GOOD JOB IN TENNESSEE, I'M SURE TAYLOR SWIFT HAS NOTHING OR DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER. AND LET'S SAY THAT I LIKE TAYLOR'S MUSIC ABOUT 25% LESS NOW. Tucker: ALL RIGHT. GOOD EFFORT. WATCHING ALL OF THIS TAPE FINALLY SUNK IN. Tucker: ROUGHLY 25% LESS. QUESTION THREE, ALSO TAKEN FROM THE WORLD OF POP CULTURE, KANYE WEST UNDER FIRE TODAY, FOR SHOWING ALL OF AMERICA HIS EYE PHONE'S PASS CODE ON LIVE TELEVISION. HE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, KANYE TOOK OUT HIS PHONE AND HIT THE SAME NUMBER 6 TIMES TO UNLOCK IT. WHAT VERY UNSECURE NUMBER WAS IT? BRET BAIER. ZERO. NO, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ZEROS, I THINK IT US 000000. Tucker: ALL ZEROS. YES. Tucker: WAS IT ALL ZEROS? WHAT WE WANT TO START WITH, IS, I BROUGHT WOW. NOT EXACTLY SECURE. Tucker: THE JUDGES SAY THAT'S ENOUGH ZEROS. WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE COMEBACK STORY OF THE WEEK. 1 TO ZERO. YOU ARE BACK TO STASIS. GOOD EGG. Tucker: WHICH FORMER AMERICAN PRESIDENT WILL COME TO LIFE IN THE FORM OF A 3-D HOLOGRAM IN WASHINGTON? KRISTIN. REAGAN. Tucker: REAGAN? RAY BEGAN. Tucker: A HOLOGRAM AT HIS LIBRARY. EVERY FOUR YEARS ALMOST EVERY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL INVOKES THE SPIRIT OF PRESIDENT REAGAN. NOW AT HIS LIBRARY, THAT SPIRIT HAS BECOME A VIRTUAL REALITY. THREE HOLOGRAMS OF PRESIDENT REAGAN WILL MAKE THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE. I'M NOT SURE THIS CONNECTED. YOU SHOULD HAVE HOLOGRAMS IN HERE. TAKE MORE TIME OFF. Tucker: LET'S GET THAT IN OUR CONTRACT. HAVE A FRIDAY OFF. Tucker: FINAL QUESTION, THIS ONE ALSO MULTIPLE CHOICE, FRONTIER AIRLINES, KICKED OFF AN ORLANDO WOMAN FROM ONE OF ITS FLIGHTS AFTER SHE BOARDED THE MANE WITH A PROHIBITED ANIMAL. THIS MULTIPLE CHOICE. WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL WAS IT? WAS IT, A, A PYTHON NO, NO, NO! TEN YARDS AND THE BALL. Tucker: KRISTIN LOSES A POINT, IT GOES TO BRETT. COULD I GET THE RIGHT ANSWER. Tucker: YOU COULD TIE IT UP THEN WE NEED A TIEBREAKER. ARE YOU HORRIBLY UNFAIR. Tucker: THOSE ARE THE RULES, LIKE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION, YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT. BRETT, DID SHE REFUSE TO FLY WITHOUT, A, A PYTHON, B, A SQUIRREL, OR, C, A RACCOON? A SQUIRREL. Tucker: WAS IT A SQUIRREL? A WOMAN WAS KICKED OFF A FLIGHT AFTER BRINGING AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SQUIRREL ON TO THE PLANE. FRONTIER AIRLINES ONLY ALLOWS DOGS OR CATS. THIS IS UNUSUAL. EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SQUIRREL. Tucker: I SEE IT WAS MULTIPLE CHOICE. I KNOW, I KNOW. I GOT EXCITED. Tucker: WE HAVE TO GO TO THE TIEBREAKER. WE HAVE THE SAME TIEBREAKING QUESTION, OKAY? IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW BEFORE, YOU KNOW IT. I DON'T. Tucker: YES YOU DO. HERE'S THE TIEBREAKER. WHAT IS THE CAPITAL OF BURKINA FAOSSO? THIS IS YET? Tucker: HAS ANYBODY GOTTEN IT? Tucker: NO. I DON'T KNOW. Tucker: IT IS WAGADUDU. I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT. Tucker: IN THIS RARE INSTANCE, NEVER BEFORE SEEN WAIT, WE HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. WHAT IS THE CAPITAL OF MADAGASAR? MADAGASAR, THE CAPITAL. Tucker: YES. CAN YOU GOOGLE THAT? I HAVE TWO THOUGHTS. Tucker: OUR JUDGES ARE SAYING NO REASONABLY INFORMED PERSON SHOULD HAVE TO KNOW EITHER ONE OF THOSE ANSWERS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE SHOW WE HAVE A SPLIT DECISION, WE HAVE AN ACTUAL TIE, IN WHICH BOTH OF YOU GET A MEDAL, BOTH OF YOU CLAIM THE VICTORY, BOTH OF YOU GO HOME PROUD. THIS IS QUITE THE MY LENNIAL. Tucker: WE ONLY HAVE ONE MUG, BUT THIS REQUIRES AT SOME POINT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS YOU HAVE
