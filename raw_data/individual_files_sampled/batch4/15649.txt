Canada now has Calais tani extremists setting our House of Commons agenda but this time it is thanks to our weak-kneed official opposition and not our dim-witted prime minister the Conservative Party of Canada almost almost did something right and then they snatch two feet away from the jaws of victory the way they always seem to do let me explain this time Justin Trudeau as you know has caused an international diplomatic crisis with India because he invited a convicted terrorist named Jaspal Atwal to dinner with him in India and then Trudeau tried to blame the Indian government for the invite who then had to make a statement calling Trudeau what amounts to a bald-faced liar it is a real mess at wall despite being convicted of attempted murder of an Indian minister who was in Canada for a wedding has long and deep ties to the Liberal Party Atwal is a Sikh separatist and a proponent of creating a Sikh country in the Punjab just carving up India he's part of the kalos tiny extremist movement that's a movement that has used terrorism like the Air India bombing that killed 280 canadians and political assassinations like the murder of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her to seek bodyguards and the murder that Atwal himself nearly committed on Canadian soil anyway so wisely for once the Conservatives were trying to do something to set themselves apart from the soft on terror liberals and to show the world that we stand with the world's largest democracy our friends in India conservatives were as early as last night going to bring forward a motion in the House of Commons that called upon the house to a value the contributions of Canadian Sikhs and Canadians of Indian origin in our national life that be condemns in the strongest terms all forms of terrorism including callous townie extremism and the glorification of any individuals who have committed acts of violence to advance the cause of an independent callous Teti state in India and C stand with a united India so pretty straightforward motion if you're against a motion that denounces terrorism you might be a crazy person the motion immediately separates seek Canadians from terrorists including Calais Danny extremists but incredibly that motion condemning Calais Tandy terrorism has now been replaced with a motion on Canada summer jobs the new motion renounces the Liberals attestation of progressive values that denied pro-life organizations access to summer jobs funding this is the text of the new motion it reads that in the opinion of the house organizations that engage in non-political non activist work such as feeding the homeless helping refugees and giving kids an opportunity to go to camp should be able to access Canada summer jobs funding regardless of their private convictions and regardless of whether or not they choose to sign the application attestation you know what that's a great motion don't get me wrong I like it I support it but the only reason it is on the agenda is because the Conservative Party of Canada caved to overnight pressure from activists in the Sikh Canadian community and I know I know that's exactly what's happening because my favorite intrepid journalist Candice Malcolm published an email she received from a Sikh activist that called on the Sikh community to put intense pressure on the conservatives here's the text of her email it reads tomorrow the Conservative Party of Canada is planning to use its precious time in the House of Commons to force a debate on the condemning of callous Tanny terrorism and they put cows any terrorism in scare quotes as though it's not a thing but 280 dead Canadians were unavailable for comment let's go on instead of using House of Commons time for saying things that will actually help people's lives they're targeting the Sikh community and targeting us as extremists okay we also know that's not true because the first line of the motion distinguishes between Sikhs and Indians and callused any extremists I guess these folks are just counting on nobody doing their own due diligence and actually reading what the motion says let's continue there is no reason for starting this debate but the effect will be clear Canadians are starting to see us as terrorists when we are not this will damage us in the public eye and hurt our community especially our youth okay you know what the reason for starting this debate is because there was a real-life calles Danny terrorists with the Prime Minister and that's you know sort of a big deal in fact I think it's a big enough deal that the Sikh community in Canada should be calling the Prime Minister out on this anyway the email continues everyone please leave voicemails at the offices of the Conservative leader Andrew Shearer and Aaron O'Toole who is bringing this motion forward please communicate to them that if the Conservatives carry through and bring this motion forward then we will not welcome them in our gurdwaras and we will absolutely not support them in the future please communicate that we are deeply hurt by this please leave voicemails for both O'Toole and Shearer the numbers are below well it seems like callous Danny extremists have a lot of political pull here in Canada and that's because they absolutely do they got this motion condemning terrorism yanked right off the agenda let me say that again this was a motion condemning terrorism Conservative Party leader Andrew Shearer is doing exactly what Trudeau is doing he's courting extremists for votes and he's insulting normal conservatives along the way does Andrew Shearer really think that we can't tell the difference between our Sikh Canadian friends and neighbors and these radical Sikh extremists the way the email writer says we can't that's like expecting us to confuse some random québécois dude and the terrorists of the FLQ Canadians are so much smarter than this the Conservatives have just abandoned their own Laurel high ground and now they can't really be critical of Trudeau for his international diplomatic disaster of a trip to India I mean I guess they can still be critical of his clothing choices and constant obnoxious dancing but can the official conservatives really be critical of Trudeau for having a convicted would-be assassin of an Indian Minister over for dinner in India frankly at this point I'm not entirely convinced that Andrew Shia wouldn't have invited at wal himself if he was pressured by the right political extremist groups here in Canada I mean look how quickly Shearer folded I am a highly critical of the Liberals when they abandon our allies and our traditionally morally guided Canadian foreign policy I torched the Liberals when they refused to continue the fight against Isis i torched the Liberals when they didn't have the guts to stand up for an undivided Jerusalem with our friends the Americans and if I want to be a principled person unlike the people making the decisions in the upper echelon of the Conservative Party of Canada right now then I am to have to hold the Conservatives to account for this failure to do what is so obviously right what do you stand for conservatives do you stand for political expediency or do you stand up for what's right do you stand against terrorism do you stand with our allies look I like Andrew share I want him to do well Canadians need him to do well he must be the strong principled adult foil to the SJW adolescent flake we have in the Prime Minister's office right now sadly it took three months of extreme pressure from grassroots conservatives to get the Conservative Party of Canada just to say that they will recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel and that one should have been a complete and total no-brainer but at least now we know that pressure on the Conservatives causes them to buckle so let's do what the extremists have done let's take a page from their book let's apply pressure to this wound conservatives call your MPs email Andrew Shearer email conservative House Leader Candice Bergen email deputy conservative House Leader Chris war kanten and to share this video we know Shane works tell these conservatives to do what is right by our political ally and our enormous trade partner India if we cannot stand by the world's largest democracy in their fight against extremism we will fall for anything for the rabble media I'm Sheila Gunn read well the mainstream media is busy dragging the Conservative Party left it is our job to make sure that they stay right and we can only do that with your help and your support if you liked this video share it and click the link below to become a rebel subscriber today you
