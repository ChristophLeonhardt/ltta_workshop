you know when I think back on the most exciting moments of the Democratic National Convention I generally find I regained consciousness about two hours later standing by the side of the freeway in my underwear holding a sign that reads will mow lawns if you'll just please kill me but perhaps the most inspiring moment of the convention was when Hillary Clinton said this she just looked so talking at me with that creepy smile of hers that I found it really uplifting to see how her simple faith in science gave her so much joy and then of course there was the way all the Democrats started clapping for science as if they were trying to bring science back to life the way they did with Tinker Bell during the Democrat class trip to see Peter Pan so I said to myself Clem it's time you stopped clinging to your Bible and your gun and started believing in some of this here's science stuff yourself and I got insulted because I'd called myself Clem and that's not my name so I took out my gun and shot myself luckily the Bible was in my pocket and stopped the bullet but how is a simple knuckle-dragging conservative like me supposed to understand anything is sophisticated and Democrat like is science well I got down to work and here's what I learned Democrats believe in evolution that means that over thousands and thousands of years Nature has shaped human beings for reproduction making women beautiful and nurturing so that they can attract powerful successful men who will impregnate them and protect them while the women take care of their young and these gender roles are completely constructed by an oppressive society and can be thrown off like an old coat to make life more fair Democrats believe that the earth is at the mercy of natural forces that brought it from a hot molten state to a cooler solid one then through ice ages in which glaciers formed and then melted to create many of our Great Lakes and then new ice ages came and ended and today if the temperature drops half a degree in 50 years it's a sign that driving your car is causing the apocalypse and the government has to take over the oil industry Democrats believe in building brilliant new machines that can look right inside a woman's body and see a tiny baby forming in the womb with completely shaped fingers and toes and a beating heart and a brain images that must never be shown on television so you won't feel bad when you rip the baby to pieces because you really wanted a Sagittarius and you're doing June so after I learned about all these things I said to myself Homer I may just be a dumb Republican but I'm not so dumb that I'm going to believe in anything as a rational as Democrat science no matter how much it makes Hillary Clinton smile that creepy smile then I said to myself stop calling me Homer that's not my name trigger warning I'm Andrew Clayton and this is the Andrew Klay booster I'm gonna get home tonight my wife is living with the woman 40 years and he still doesn't understand what I'm saying and neither do i but that's like it's it's mailbag day whoo-hoo we can't yeah we can't really do whoohoo cuz Lindsey's not here but we have whoohoo in our hearts because we're going to be answering all your questions that's later in the show so if you're watching live on Facebook you only get 15 minutes then you got to come to the Daily wire hear the rest and then you must subscribe pry your greedy fingers off your lousy egg box and pay a bucks a month to subscribe then you can not only watch the show but be part of the mailbag and ask your questions and have all your problems solved also this is the day that I x like to just plug my upcoming book my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew who comes to faith in Christ you can pre-order it on Amazon and you'll get it probably probably sometime this month it's due out in September but it'll probably be available toward the end of August get it you will like it I promise all right we are going to wrap up this discussion of Donald Trump and the great Wrath of Khan controversy and what's been going on because you know the media has just drummed this into the ground because they smell blood they think they've got him this time and maybe they do maybe this is the time when finally even his supporters just have had enough he's insulted a gold star you know he's insulted gold star parents and he doesn't can't restrain himself and what what's wrong with him but I hate to point this out but it is kind of detracting from the fact that we're not talking about any of the issues that these people are supposed to run upon you know what is Hillary Clinton going to be what's she gonna do what's Trump gonna do if they get elected president and what would it's all about this kind of flashpoints that the media love and of course they're only flashpoints if Trump does them and not of Hillary Clinton yes our own the Daily wires Robert Cray chick had a piece up on the site it's still up there about the questions that they asked Hillary Clinton when she appeared at a campaign event in Ashland Ohio and the press surrounded her this is a presidential candidate who has not given a press conference since Jesus was here I think was the last joking press conference with Pontius Pilate is the last time this woman gave her press conference they surround her and these are the questions the tough questions they ask one do you think Donald Trump crossed the line in his comments but epic on family that's a tough why she was reeling from that one how about two what do you think it says about Donald Trump's character three do you believe the election when we look back on it do you believe what happened with mr. Khan is potentially a turning point where they were really getting down to it you know hard to know how she handled these things have you reached out to Captain Khan's mother have you reached out to mrs. Khan these are five the totality of what you said why do you think Republicans are continuing to stand by Donald Trump and six do you worry that Americans are becoming desensitized to this kind of nasty you know I mean I would it would really serve them right if people elected Donald Trump just to push him in their face and I would almost do it just just to see them like you know cringe as they do it because they're so unfair they're so one-sided anyway this is a victory of course for Hillary because if she can make the election about what a psycho Donald Trump is and he is a psycho then she wins if she makes the election about what if the election becomes about Obama's record her record her lying her dishonesty her corruption then who knows who knows which way it goes so but the really interesting thing was Obama smelling blood you know because these guys now have got it they're on it he made one of his rare political mistakes yesterday and the thing about Obama you know it's not that Obama is a political genius it's just not to make mistakes when the Prescott core essentially lives in your lower intestine you know what it was Scott Ellie's head is so far up Barack Obama's backside that he can actually see out of his mouth it's hard not it's hard to make mistakes yeah how do you make mistakes when the press is covering up for you essentially but yesterday I felt he made a mistake he was at a presser with the prime minister of Singapore and the reporter asks him throws him one of these easy questions do you think Donald Trump is unfit to be President and remember this is a president he's not running for office again he's not part of this election total classless reply from Obama but that's not why it was a mistake let's listen first to Obama what Obama said about this I think the Republican nominee is unfit that's a service president I said so last week and he keeps on proving it the notion that he would attack a gold star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country the fact that he doesn't appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe in the Middle East in Asia means that he's woefully unprepared to do this job now this is very uncommon for a president who is not running for re-election to attack to really mix it up in politics I mean it's one thing for him to say I support our candidate and all this stuff but to really go after this guy like this so Obama really smells like he really thinks he's got this guy you know and it's like he's really going after me and he goes after the party as well play the second guy this is not just my opinion I think what's been interesting is the repeated denunciations of his statements by leading Republicans including the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader and prominent Republicans like John McCain and the question I think that they have to ask themselves is if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable why are you still endorsing him what does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer see now just to remind you this is the president who personally he personally did this used the Internal Revenue Service in a scandal that would be far worse than Richard Nixon if anybody covered it you know you should read the intimidation game by Kintz trestle on the Wall Street Journal she out she lays it out how Obama and Lois Lerner and the IRS and the Justice Department you politicized our core you know log our core law enforcement agency and our core tax collection agency which is obviously the most powerful agency in the country to intimidate the tea party and shut up silence the Democrats to silence them and he did it he did it knowingly and then he lied about it and he said there was not a smidgen of corruption and everybody gave him a pass on that he they're still doing it they're still doing it right now those Tea Party guys who didn't get tax exemption so they could participate in elections they still haven't received it it's still going on and it's absolutely an absolute silence totally not coming so this guy says to me you know yeah I've silenced you I've stepped on your throat I've used the Justice Department and the IRS to silence you now let me tell you what you should do to be a moral person you know what's the response to that I can't say it because this is a you know a family show I can't say what the more the only response to that is but it's quick its brief and you know I think everybody and and these and this is also as a party by the way where john mccain and paul ryan they've said that you know Trump said the wrong thing it's a party where there are principal people trying to find their way with this wild man as their candidate whereas the Democrats there's no division there there's nobody who's not who saying yeah I don't think Hillary Clinton should lie all the time I don't think she should you know sell our resources to Russia I don't think she should sell the government to government services for cash maybe she shouldn't do that there's no Democrat saying that there's nobody saying it's all about Trump and he's got a big mouth and all this stuff the reason this is a mistake though it's not just a mistake for that it's the reason it's a mistake is because it draws the attention back to Obama and he's a failure everything he's done has failed and you know he only he's only walking on water because the press is be stung his snake bit by the color of the skin a he's a first black president so he's got to be a genius he's got to be the savior and of course they agree with his basic socialism and his basic socialistic policies so they're protecting him but this gives Trump a chance to actually do what Trump should be doing is to respond he was on the O'Reilly show and this is his response I think he's the worst president maybe in the history of our country I think he's been a disaster he's been weak he's been ineffective you look at this so-called recovery it's setting record lows it's I guess not since 1949 has there been anything like it you look at home ownership look at what happened as an example he talks about Ukraine I believe I know far more about foreign policy that he knows look at Ukraine he talks about Ukraine well you know how tough he is right how tough he is with Russia in the meantime they took over Crimea and I understood that in most papers covered what I said accurately some didn't because the press is so dishonest but Crimea I mean the Russians took it over under Obama's a very powerful leadership and you know he talks about me with Russia wouldn't it be a wonderful thing frankly if we actually got along with Russia and worked out some kind of a deal where we go in and knock the hell out of Isis along with NATO and along with countries that are in the area would that be wonderful as opposed to fighting but Crimea was taken over and and you know this better than anybody because you were covering it a couple of years ago it was taken over during Obama's regime big tough president this is the kind of thing that Obama never ears and he needs to you know he issued trump issued a statement that was great here's what it said Obama Clinton have single-handedly destabilized the Middle East handed Iraq Libya and Syria to Isis and allowed our personnel to be slaughtered at Benghazi then they put a ran on the path to nuclear weapons then they allow dozens of veterans to die awaiting for medical care that never came Hillary Clinton put the whole country at risk with her illegal email server deleted evidence of her crime and lied repeatedly about her conduct which endangered us all they released criminal aliens into our country who killed one innocent American after another and have repeatedly admitted migrants later implicated in terrorism they have produced the worst recovery since the Great Depression they have shipped millions of our best jobs overseas to appease their global special interests they have betrayed our security and our workers and Hillary Clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office that's all true that's what is he talking about confort you know what else he was talking about yesterday he told The Wall Street Journal reporter he's not going to endorse Paul Ryan and John McCain because John McCain and Paul Ryan have criticized him so he used poverty through Paul Ryan's words back at him you know I'm not quite there yet whatever Ryan said he said impactful this is what he does he had this any Republican probably had this if he would say what he just said in that statement Obama made the mistake of allowing him to do that but of course Trump has no capability to stick to the program and do what he has to do I have to say goodbye to Facebook come on over to the Daily wire and hear the mailbag well I feel like I should charge over a hill or something like that so Trump you know so Trump can't do what he has to do because he's a psycho however part one of the things that was on the news did crack me up and I will tell you why and it will ease us into this in the next conversation we're gonna have his Trump had this thing with the baby I'm sure most of you have heard this word then baby crying during his speech so just play play the way first he says it's okay and then not so much the biggest in the world a Chinese bank don't worry about that baby I love babies though I love I hear that baby crying I like I like it what a baby what a beautiful baby don't worry don't want the moms running around like don't worry about it you know it's young and beautiful and healthy and that's what we want okay but but look look we have the piggy bank they have ripped us to shreds ripped us absolutely to shreds actually I was only kidding you can get the baby out of here that's all right don't worry I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking that's okay people don't understand now what gets me about this though that of course was widely reported yet for a report from stepping on a baby you know it's like Shapiro tweeted out like you know in the old days I want to take that baby out on a stretcher but here's the tweet that I loved here was my favorite tweet of yesterday all right they attack Donald Trump they say add babies to the list of people Donald Trump would kick out of his campaign rallies who do you think sent out that tweet Planned Parenthood so help me you don't just kill them like that baby I want to talk about because this election is over no matter which disaster we're facing we still have this culture this insane left-wing culture that thinks it really does think it's worse to tell a mom to take a crying baby out of a speech which by the way I have some sympathy for and who wants to hear a baby crying during a speech he thinks that's worse than killing the baby as long as it's giving you freedom you know there was another thing that I've been wanting and wanting to get to all week this coalition of black lives matter organizations put out their demands there's six demands there it's let me read you just a few of them we demand an end to the war against black people since this country's inception there have been named and unnamed Wars on our communities we demand an end to the criminalization incarceration and killing of our people an immediate end to the criminalization and dehumanization of black youth across all areas of society including but not limited to our nation's justice and education system social service agencies and media and pop culture so no more crewmen no more arresting these black criminals because they're black so they don't get you know that's gonna be great for those neighborhoods that you know the majority people in those neighborhoods are law-abiding people trying to get by and they're they're the victims you know the they're the victims of the criminals doesn't matter we demand reparations for past and continuing harms people who have never you know they've never been discriminated against by the government which was the problem it wasn't the problem that individuals discriminate against everybody but the problem was that got that government was actually discriminating against black people these people never have experienced that they want to be paid back for history they wanted us to make history right that's not the way it works if that could be done I would do it but it's not gonna work you know this is the thing our culture is so polluted with this stuff and it's not gonna come back together it's we who are going to have to do it individually and we should be fighting so much more locally for for power for our representatives for our senators and all this stuff because whatever happens at the presidential level at this point it's going to be bad news you know so this is the culture we're gonna be fighting and that's why I talk so much about the culture all right let's do the mailbag let's get to the mail we're gonna start with Mathias Mathias who says I'm just looking at madness here I just you sending me questions I'll know if there's like you stupid I'll know it's y'all recognizing you all right your show is awesome and I can't wait to read your new book I appreciate it I have been seen a lot of these sappy unity posts on social media lately the kind that call for us to come together and such and I can't help thinking what a crock the people calling for unity are usually the first to throw the ism accusation so I'm curious to hear if you think we are too divided to come together again or is this still hope unity is a crock there is no question about it this is a democracy we disagree that's the way it works you disagree you fight you compromise you get places I do think we have this incredible deadlock that has come from the poisonous relationship of our media to our politics I mean I think that that's what's causing it some of this is on the right to by the way I think the there is extremism it's easy to sit behind a keyboard easy to sit behind a microphone and tell people that every single principle has to be a hundred percent pure and anybody who compromises on anything is a traitor it's so easy to do that we do that on the right on the left they never have to make an argument because nobody criticizes them they are so right they're likely like you know surrounded didn't cotton candy you know there the media tells them they're fine that Hollywood tells them they're fine and when somebody disagrees with them they start screaming like a stuck pig because they think they've been offended you know oh you offended me by saying I was wrong you know that's the way democracy works healthy argument vigorous argument a little bit of name-calling every democracy has some name-calling you know all this stuff that would be a healthy thing it's not the unity we're looking for and it's not civility we're looking for it either by the way because civility may that rush limbaugh should shut up civility never means that barack obama shouldn't call us terrorists as he did you know that's not we don't that's not so uncivil it's only uncivil when the right does it so civilities is ridiculous unity is ridiculous but compromise and process are part of the system and that's the kind of thing that we get away from when you have a media that is totally one-sided and a reactive right-wing media because we have reacted to the left they've driven us insane as we see you from the fact that we've not that's her presidential candidate all right from george you mentioned a few months ago that you were working with an artist on a graphic novel is that still happening if so can you reveal any information and do you have any new novels in the pipeline i yes it's still happening the graphic novel is coming out I'm not sure win you know I actually have to ask them that it's called the Jenny and the darkness and it's about a fearless female prosecutor and a hitman who has a conversion experience and basically really he's the guy who knows where all the bodies are buried because he buried them and now suddenly he's on the run because he doesn't want to do it anymore and he he and this woman team up so it's called Jenny in the darkness and I'll let you know when I know more about it to have any new novels in the pipeline no I don't really for the first time I took some time off from writing novels I have just this now really last week started to prepare a new novel so hopefully I'll have it done sometime next year and then it'll come out all right from Frank given your interest in philosophy and art have you encountered the works of Francis Schaeffer and if so what are your views on his work I would also like to thank you for your work as a black conservative there are really no media outlets that are tolerable for me I don't blame you the Liberals are using my people as their political slaves and they love it and a general majority of the conservative media does not seem to have interest in the black conservative American and due to most blacks being default Democrats your podcast this is my safe space but all jokes aside you were doing a great job brother thank you Frank I really appreciate hearing that that's a good thing to hear francis schaeffer I read his book two years ago the God who was there and I'm being just bluntly honest when I tell you I can remember that much about it I think his argument was I remember kind of enjoying it but I don't it didn't make a big impression on me but I remember his argument he does have an argument about the fact that reality remains the same whether you believe in God or not as I recall which is one of the things I love to talk about the fact that reality this is the thing I think Christians get wrong reality as we know it doesn't change simply because you have faith it's still the same there's an old story about two men in a jungle and they stumble on a well-kept garden and one of them says obviously somebody tended this garden and the other one says no it's just an accident and the point is the garden is there for both of them the jungle is there for both of them it's all a question of interpretation and which one makes more sense as for the issue of black conservatism it is a real problem it so you know obviously there's no problem on the left because they're in the catbird seat they've got like 90 percent of the black vote they don't do anything for black people they you know every every city where black people are suffering most is a depth not just a Democrat run City it hasn't seen a Republican in 50 years Detroit Chicago all these cities where black people die where black people suffer where black people are stuck in poverty they're all won by Democrats and in fact there is a movement of blacks to Republican cities where there are jobs you know although all the middle-class blacks of left San Francisco for instance and you're absolutely right conservatives have not got the guts to walk into these neighborhoods to walk into black you know churches to walk into black organizations and tell the truth not you know Oh black lives matter have a point but police lives matters do black lives matter have no point they're wrong their statistics are wrong their point of view is wrong everything they say is untrue who is gonna have the courage to bail that cat to walk in and do these things the minute they do they will start to slowly slowly garner some of the black vote back and then they'll be hope you know then they'll be hope because once the Democrats lose this solid block they will be destroyed unless they open the gates of the country let all the Mexicans in and they'll only have them for a generation because okay catch on - all right yeah I'll do one more I'll do one more except I lost it there it is from Kimmy it would be great if you could put the things I like in the description so your fans can read watch experience your recommendations love your work Lindsay is working on this unbeknownst to me she wrote me a note saying she is actually putting together a catalogue of stuff I like which is great because I'm always afraid of repeating it you know cuz I forget myself I didn't keep this there's only so much stuff I like after all so that is on the way alright we're gonna move on we'll come back to the mailbag next week so peel off your 8 bucks and start talking and start sending us questions stuff I like we've been talking about the culture and the way in which sometimes good art sells bad stuff and how to interpret it and how to deal with it because you know if you're constantly condemning art for too much sex too much violence you make yourself irrelevant you know you say like oh I only want to watch the things I enjoy fine I get that but art and the culture have a huge effect I mean this is the famous Andrew Breitbart line that politics is downstream from culture by the time people are voting the election is already decided because you know we were talking before about you know Oh Donald Trump said something nasty about a baby it says Planned Parenthood who kills like a billion babies every 20 minutes you know that's the culture that is the culture black people's you know you see them on TV with his self-righteousness you know you've got to stop arresting black people so more of us can be killed because we need more dead but you know it's like insane and in that and the fact is they have all the means of producing culture and we have got to take it back and you can't just take it back by cranking all the time you have to start making stuff you have to start making good stuff and you have to start going to the good stuff that gets made and that good stuff is not PG g-rated stuff that tells you everything is fine if you believe in Jesus because that's not true everything is not fine even if you believe in Jesus I'm sorry but that's not the way life works so it's a good thing to talk about how culture gets made and why it is some of this stuff that looks like it sells something bad might actually be selling something beautiful and good so today we were talking about tough guy stuff yesterday and I want to talk about a film called body body heat is 1981 Lawrence Kasdan who went on to make what's the film about the the Generation Big Chill I think so Lawrence Kasdan directed and wrote it William Hurt stars as a lawyer and Kathleen Turner is this rich wife and they have an affair and it leads of course to all kinds of mayhem and it's based on let's take a look at William Hurt picking up Kathleen Turner and body you stand there with me if you want but you'll have to agree not to talk about the heat I'm a married woman meaning what meaning I'm not looking for company you should have said I believe that's my business what how happy I am and how I use it you're not too smart I am I like that in a man what else you like lazy ugly horny I got a home you know it looks lazy tell me does chat like this work with most women some if they haven't been around much I wondered thought maybe I was out of touch my mother find new words rankings I told you I've got a husband I'll buy him one too he's out of town my favorite kind will drink to him well he comes up on weekends all the time it's it's good stuff good dialogue very sexy a lot of big sex scenes that made a big splash in 1981 when it came out it's from a strain we were talking about the the invention of the tough guy tough guy American fiction which was like jazz one of the great American art forms and how it was an attempt to form to deal with the fact that the social structure of the West had collapsed during World War one that that World War one had basically put the West in disrepute and so you had Dashiell Hammett trying to create an existential detective who did the right things for existential reasons you had Raymond Chandler trying to recreate the chivalrous detective who did the right thing because he held the ideal of chivalry inside him but the third strain of this was James M Cain who basically was a neo 'lest he basically said people have the hots for each other then they kill each other then they become afraid of each other and the fear turns love to hate that was a great line when one drop of fear turns love to hate and i-i've before in stuff I like had talked about one of the great American novels by James M Cain which is The Postman Always Rings Twice gotta read it it's just a terrific novel takes about 20 minutes to read body heat is simply really a remake almost of that it's just a redoing of it it's in that genre of The Postman Always Rings Twice the movies not bad either the original movie not the Jack Nicholson one the old one with Garfield in it it was a description of a world in which all the standards had collapsed and there was nothing left but desire and greed nothing left but desire and greed and it was essentially telling you that this was all there is now because Christ is gone the West is gone the standards are gone there is nothing left but desire and greed and it was a beautiful description in a way the and yes is it titillating you bet it is is it exciting yes the murder scene in The Postman Always Rings Twice is one of the hottest scenes ever written it is one of it is a scene that when I was a little kid I think I started out I went through puberty simply by reading that scene I think I started reading before I was in puberty when I finished reading that scene I had so you gone through puberty just for messing it's a spectacular spectacular thing because sex becomes again a metaphor for passion a metaphor for love sometimes you know Alfred Hitchcock said you should never show there are two things you should never show in a movie if you'd never show people praying and you should never show them having sex and the reason is when you show those things they become empty because they're completely internal experiences the experience of sex is not you know an external experience I mean I always used to tell this this story an absolutely true story when I lived in New York I lived on a narrow street I could see through the window across the street and this young couple moved in and started having sex in front of the open window across the street it was like riveting I mean first of all they were absolutely gorgeous and I would sit there and I said to my wife look what these people are doing it's obscene in my way should we do one of those things oh yeah because when it matters it means something it's the inner life that matters not the outer life and that's the problem with the movies that's why a culture that is based on visual art becomes stupid we're a culture that's based on writing becomes wise that's that really is the difference between England and us or a visual culture and a culture becomes stupid because the metaphors become reality we start to believe that sex is the important thing not the internal experience and that's one of the the lies of the movies and the only way to the only way to counteract that is to criticize it to speak about it not to attack it not to say take that sexy now but to simply explain it but it's a metaphor it's something they're telling you something it's what the movie is about not what you're seeing necessarily directly on screen all right we'll talk more about this oh I have some good news about the Clavin this weekend coming up to remind me I will tell you tomorrow I will tell you tomorrow be here this I'm Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show be here and you'll hear the good news
