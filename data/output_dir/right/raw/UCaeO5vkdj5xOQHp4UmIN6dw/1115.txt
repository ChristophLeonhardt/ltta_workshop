2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,580
and on a game show<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in the old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I heard this I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a kid they said</font>

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,639
it was a Polish guy because Polish

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,929
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were supposed to be stupid and</font>

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">nowadays they would probably say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,230
blonde<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't want to be prejudiced</font>

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,460
at all so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say it's a blonde</font>

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Polish guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a stun guy on his</font>

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,650
game show and he just can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get anything</font>

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and he doesn't get to know any of</font>

12
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the answers to anything and the emcee</font>

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,340
begins to feel sorry for him<font color="#CCCCCC"> and decides</font>

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,859
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna ask him the simplest question</font>

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he can come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with and the emcee</font>

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,520

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he says the dumb guy what is the</font>

22
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,760
