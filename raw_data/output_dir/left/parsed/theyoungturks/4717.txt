A RADIO
TALKSHOW HOST IN PENNSYLVANIA
HAS APPARENTLY JUST RECENTLY
QUIT HIS JOB AFTER BEING TOLD BY
MANAGEMENT HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO
CRITICIZE DONALD TRUMP.
HE PUT
OUT 
THIS STATEMENT.
LET'S BRING
UP THE EMAIL THAT TRIGGERED
THIS.
>> LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN.
I
WORKED IN RADIO A LITTLE BIT, IN
FACT WE ARE 
BACK ON SIRIUS
DOING RADIO NOW.
>>ARE
WE ALLOWED TO CRITICIZE TRUMP?
>>I'M PRETTY SURE WE ARE.
WE CAN
CRITICIZE ANYONE WE LIKE.
IT 
WAS
REALLY HARD TO GET ON STATIONS.
WE DO HAVE AN HONEST PROGRAM
DIRECTOR IN MINNESOTA WHO SAID
ALMOST EVERY STATION BACK THEN
WAS CONSERVATIVE TALK.
IF I PUT
YOU ON, THE REST OF THE AUDIENCE
WILL BE UPSET BECAUSE ALL THE
OTHER SHOWS ARE CONSERVATIVE.
AND I SAID SO ARE THERE ANY
PROGRESSIVE CHANNELS IN
MINNESOTA?
HE SAID I DON'T THINK
THERE ARE MANY PROGRESSIVE
CHANNELS PERIOD.
AT THE TIME
THERE WASN'T. IF YOU ARE AT
WTPA AND YOU ARE ON THE LEFT AND
HONEST, YOU WILL BE OUT OF LUCK
AND OUT OF A JOB.
IN LA IF YOU
ARE NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO THE
PRESIDENT YOU WILL BE SHUNNED.
AND THERE THEY ARE LIKE OH MY
GOD HOW DARE YOU CRITICIZE
DONALD TRUMP.
WHAT?
>>IN THE BATHROOM WE HAVE A
CLASSICAL MUSIC STATION ON, THEY
CALL TRUMP AN A-HOLE.
I'M
KIDDING.
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS
IT IS POSSIBLE THIS PERSON WAS
THE REASON FOR THAT LETTER.
BUT
IT COULD POTENTIALLY GO EVEN
HIGHER THAN THAT.
IT 
SOUNDS RIDICULOUS SO WE HAD
TO GO AND FIND THAT SONG AND
WE WILL PLAY A LITTLE BIT FOR
YOU RIGHT NOW.
>> I'M VOTING FOR DONALD FOR
PRESIDENT.
I'M VOTING FOR DONALD
FOR PRESIDENT, HE'LL MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
>> YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING ABOUT
PENNSYLVANIA?
IN BETWEEN PHILLY
AND PITTSBURGH THERE IS ALABAMA.
>>NOTHING AGAINST ALABAMA.
SO
YEAH, A GUY WHO LOVES DONALD
TRUMP SO MUCH HE IS WILLING TO
WRITE AND THEN RECORD, AND THEN
RELEASE WHAT YOU JUST LISTEN TO
単 THAT IS A ZEALOT AND IT'S
POSSIBLE HE IS PUTTING A LOT OF
PRESSURE ON THE MANAGER OF
THIS NETWORK.
>> AGAIN TO BE FAIR TO THE
RIGHT, IT'S NOT LIKE IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN ON THE LEFT.
WHEN I WAS
IN MSNBC THEY WERE NOT HAPPY
WHEN I WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO THE
PRESIDENT BACK WHEN WE HAD A
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.
ONE
INSTANCE WAS WHEN OBAMA GAVE A
SPEECH ABOUT THE EGYPTIAN
REVOLUTION, RIGHT AFTERWARDS I
SAID I WILL KEEP IT REAL AND I
SAID HE WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES.
AND I GOT A STERN TALKING TO BUY
A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE COMPANY
ABOUT HOW THAT WAS DISRESPECTFUL
TO THE PRESIDENT.
BECAUSE THEY
SAID YOU SAID IT RIGHT AFTER HIS
SPEECH.
I SAID WOULD IT BE MORE
RESPECTFUL IF I SAID IT A WEEK
LATER?
THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY
ONES GUILTY OF IT, BUT IN THIS
CASE IT IS A CONSERVATIVE 単 THE
KIND OF PARTLY MISS UNDERSTAND
THE POINT OF THE FIRST
AMENDMENT.
BUT IT IS HIS STATION
AND HE GETS TO DO WHAT HE WANTS
WITH IT.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IF
YOU ARE IN THAT NECK OF 
THE
WOODS, I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE.
>> THIS MADE ME REMEMBER 単 I
REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT A
CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST TO SAID
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE AUDIENCE
WANTS 100% LOYALTY TO DONALD
TRUMP.
IT LED TO HIM STOPPING
THE SHOW.
IT WAS EITHER RADIO OR
ONLINE.
THE AMOUNT OF
INTOLERANCE 単 WE LIKE TO IMAGINE
THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE
OPEN-MINDED.
EVERYONE SAYS THEY
ARE CRITICAL THINKERS AND THEY
LIKE THE REVIEWS BEING
CHALLENGED.
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
WANT TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT THEY
BELIEVE WITHOUT STRAYING AN INCH
FROM THAT.
AND IT CAN AFFECT YOU.
>> WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKE
CRITICAL THINKERS WHO CHALLENGE
OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS THEY MEAN
YOUR IDEAS NOT MY IDEAS.
