1
04:26:19,929 --> 04:26:20,597
KEY SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIES 

2
04:26:20,597 --> 04:26:21,197
ARE UNDECIDED IN REPUBLICANS 

3
04:26:21,197 --> 04:26:21,831
LOSE MORE THAN ONE GOP VOTE, 

4
04:26:21,831 --> 04:26:22,498
THEY WILL NEED HELP FROM THE 

5
04:26:22,498 --> 04:26:22,799
DEMOCRATS. 

6
04:26:22,799 --> 04:26:23,399
KERRY SEVERINO IS THE CHIEF 

7
04:26:23,399 --> 04:26:24,067
COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR AT 

8
04:26:24,067 --> 04:26:24,634
THE CONSERVATIVE JUDICIAL 

9
04:26:24,634 --> 04:26:25,268
CRISIS NETWORK WHICH HAS BEEN 

10
04:26:25,268 --> 04:26:25,835
INSTRUMENTAL IN SUPPORTING 

11
04:26:25,835 --> 04:26:26,336
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 

12
04:26:26,336 --> 04:26:26,869
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 

13
04:26:26,869 --> 04:26:27,537
WALK US THROUGH WHAT WILL BE 

14
04:26:27,537 --> 04:26:27,971
TAKING PLACE NEXT. 

15
04:26:27,971 --> 04:26:28,605
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE VOTE. 

16
04:26:28,605 --> 04:26:29,305
>> THERE WILL BE A VOTE IN THE 

17
04:26:29,305 --> 04:26:29,906
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THESE 

18
04:26:29,906 --> 04:26:30,540
NOMINATIONS WILL MOVE TO THE 

19
04:26:30,540 --> 04:26:31,174
FLOOR AND THEY WILL HAVE THE 

20
04:26:31,174 --> 04:26:31,741
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF THE 

21
04:26:31,741 --> 04:26:32,408
SENATE TO VOTE UP OR DOWN ON 

22
04:26:32,408 --> 04:26:32,809
HIS CONFIRMATION. 

23
04:26:32,809 --> 04:26:33,476
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE SENATORS 

24
04:26:33,476 --> 04:26:34,043
WERE CONCERNED WE HAD THE 

25
04:26:34,043 --> 04:26:34,711
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM BOTH 

26
04:26:34,711 --> 04:26:35,345
DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

27
04:26:35,345 --> 04:26:36,045
SO THAT'S WHY THE HEARINGS WERE 

28
04:26:36,045 --> 04:26:36,746
SO IMPORTANT AND THEY WILL LOOK 

29
04:26:36,746 --> 04:26:37,013
AT THAT. 

30
04:26:37,013 --> 04:26:37,480
WE STILL DON'T HAVE 

31
04:26:37,480 --> 04:26:37,847
CORROBORATION. 

32
04:26:37,847 --> 04:26:38,348
SHE DID DELIVER A VERY 

33
04:26:38,348 --> 04:26:38,915
PASSIONATE AND COMPELLING 

34
04:26:38,915 --> 04:26:39,449
TESTIMONY BUT SODA JUDGE 

35
04:26:39,449 --> 04:26:39,749
KAVANAUGH. 

36
04:26:39,749 --> 04:26:40,216
WE STILL DON'T HAVE 

37
04:26:40,216 --> 04:26:40,783
CORROBORATION OR EVIDENCE 

38
04:26:40,783 --> 04:26:41,417
SUPPORTING HER ALLEGATIONS AND 

39
04:26:41,417 --> 04:26:41,951
WHILE A LOT OF STUFF WAS 

40
04:26:41,951 --> 04:26:42,552
UNCOVERED ABOUT SOME OF THE 

41
04:26:42,552 --> 04:26:43,219
DEMOCRAT WORK TO UNDERMINE THE 

42
04:26:43,219 --> 04:26:43,720
INVESTIGATION PROCESS. 

43
04:26:43,720 --> 04:26:44,354
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL OF 

44
04:26:44,354 --> 04:26:44,988
THESE SENATORS WILL HAVE ON 

45
04:26:44,988 --> 04:26:45,188
MIND. 

46
04:26:45,188 --> 04:26:45,922
>>> PRETTY MUCH NO MATTER WHERE 

47
04:26:45,922 --> 04:26:46,522
YOU LAND IN TERMS OF JUDGE 

48
04:26:46,522 --> 04:26:47,123
KAVANAUGH AND WHETHER HE IS 

49
04:26:47,123 --> 04:26:47,757
WORTHY TO BE ON THE SUPREME 

50
04:26:47,757 --> 04:26:48,358
COURT, I THINK EVERYONE CAN 

51
04:26:48,358 --> 04:26:48,958
AGREE THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN 

52
04:26:48,958 --> 04:26:49,225
GRUELING. 

53
04:26:49,225 --> 04:26:49,759
YESTERDAY WAS EMOTIONALLY 

54
04:26:49,759 --> 04:26:50,059
EXHAUSTING. 

55
04:26:50,059 --> 04:26:50,526
JUST TO WATCH IT WAS 

56
04:26:50,526 --> 04:26:51,027
EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTING. 

57
04:26:51,027 --> 04:26:51,694
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS 

58
04:26:51,694 --> 04:26:52,295
LIKE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

59
04:26:52,295 --> 04:26:52,562
DR. FORD. 

60
04:26:52,562 --> 04:26:53,229
WE ARE HEARING THE AMERICAN BAR 

61
04:26:53,229 --> 04:26:53,763
ASSOCIATION HAS ASKED THE 

62
04:26:53,763 --> 04:26:54,364
SENATE TO WAIT UNTIL AN FBI 

63
04:26:54,364 --> 04:26:54,897
BACKGROUND CHECK CAN BE 

64
04:26:54,897 --> 04:26:55,431
PERFORMED BEFORE VOTING. 

65
04:26:55,431 --> 04:26:56,032
>> THE FBI HAS SAID THEY'VE 

66
04:26:56,032 --> 04:26:56,666
DONE THE BACKGROUND CHECK AND 

67
04:26:56,666 --> 04:26:57,333
THEY ADDED THIS INFORMATION TO 

68
04:26:57,333 --> 04:26:57,500
IT. 

69
04:26:57,500 --> 04:26:58,101
WHAT WE SAW IS UNFORTUNATELY 

70
04:26:58,101 --> 04:26:58,768
THE SENATE DEMOCRATS, WHO WERE 

71
04:26:58,768 --> 04:26:59,469
THE ONLY ONES IN POSSESSION OF 

72
04:26:59,469 --> 04:27:00,103
THESE ALLEGATIONS AT THE TIME 

73
04:27:00,103 --> 04:27:00,803
AND THAT WOULD'VE BEEN THE MOST 

74
04:27:00,803 --> 04:27:01,270
APPROPRIATE ROUTE OF 

75
04:27:01,270 --> 04:27:01,804
INVESTIGATION, THEY DID 

76
04:27:01,804 --> 04:27:02,071
NOTHING. 

77
04:27:02,071 --> 04:27:02,772
IT'S STARK CONTRAST TO WHAT THE 

78
04:27:02,772 --> 04:27:03,373
SENATOR DID DURING THE ANITA 

79
04:27:03,373 --> 04:27:03,840
HILL INVESTIGATIONS. 

80
04:27:03,840 --> 04:27:04,540
THEY HELD ON TO THIS AND DIDN'T 

81
04:27:04,540 --> 04:27:05,108
TURN IT OVER TO THE FBI. 

82
04:27:05,108 --> 04:27:05,708
WE ARE AT A POINT ONCE THE 

83
04:27:05,708 --> 04:27:06,309
INVESTIGATION -- CLAIMS ARE 

84
04:27:06,309 --> 04:27:06,909
BLOWN UP IN THE MEDIA, IT 

85
04:27:06,909 --> 04:27:07,577
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO BACK 

86
04:27:07,577 --> 04:27:08,111
AND TRY TO SEPARATE THE 

87
04:27:08,111 --> 04:27:08,678
WITNESSES INDIVIDUALLY AND 

88
04:27:08,678 --> 04:27:09,312
INTERVIEW THEM OR SOMETHING. 

89
04:27:09,312 --> 04:27:09,946
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

90
04:27:09,946 --> 04:27:10,613
TAKES OVER AND THERE'S THE SAME 

91
04:27:10,613 --> 04:27:11,180
PENALTIES FOR LYING TO THE 

92
04:27:11,180 --> 04:27:11,814
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT THERE 

93
04:27:11,814 --> 04:27:12,448
IS THE FBI AND IS COVERED BY 

94
04:27:12,448 --> 04:27:12,882
THE SAME STATUTE. 

95
04:27:12,882 --> 04:27:13,483
THEY HAVE BEEN FOR TWO WEEKS 

96
04:27:13,483 --> 04:27:14,083
PERFORMING AN INVESTIGATION. 

97
04:27:14,083 --> 04:27:14,617
THEY HAVE TAKEN TESTIMONY 

98
04:27:14,617 --> 04:27:15,118
EFFECTIVELY UNDER OATH. 

99
04:27:15,118 --> 04:27:15,818
IS UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY FROM 

100
04:27:15,818 --> 04:27:16,352
EVERYONE WHO WAS NAMED. 

101
04:27:16,352 --> 04:27:16,953
ALL OF THE LATER ALLEGATIONS 

102
04:27:16,953 --> 04:27:17,487
THAT THEY REACHED OUT. 

103
04:27:17,487 --> 04:27:18,054
SOME OF THEM HAVE HAD NO 

104
04:27:18,054 --> 04:27:18,655
RESPONSE AS THEY REACHED OUT 

105
04:27:18,655 --> 04:27:19,288
EIGHT TIMES BUT THEY CONTINUE 

106
04:27:19,288 --> 04:27:19,656
TO REACH OUT. 

107
04:27:19,656 --> 04:27:20,256
FORTUNATELY SENATE DEMOCRATS 

108
04:27:20,256 --> 04:27:20,890
ARE REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE. 

109
04:27:20,890 --> 04:27:21,457
THAT'S A SHAME BECAUSE IT 

110
04:27:21,457 --> 04:27:22,125
SHOULD BE A BIPARTISAN EFFORT. 

111
04:27:22,125 --> 04:27:22,825
THEY HAVE BEEN MORE BUSY ASKING 

112
04:27:22,825 --> 04:27:23,459
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION THAN 

113
04:27:23,459 --> 04:27:23,893
ACTUALLY DOING THE 

114
04:27:23,893 --> 04:27:24,560
INVESTIGATION WE HAVE IN FRONT 

115
04:27:24,560 --> 04:27:24,894
OF US FOR THE 

116
04:27:24,894 --> 04:27:25,328
>> YOU ARE RIGHT. 

117
04:27:25,328 --> 04:27:25,995
IT'S THE SENATE DEMOCRATS THAT 

118
04:27:25,995 --> 04:27:26,496
KEEP ASKING FOR AN FBI 

119
04:27:26,496 --> 04:27:26,863
INVESTIGATION. 

120
04:27:26,863 --> 04:27:27,463
THEY OBVIOUSLY THINK AN FBI 

121
04:27:27,463 --> 04:27:28,064
INVESTIGATION WOULD BE MORE 

122
04:27:28,064 --> 04:27:28,698
VALUABLE THAN THE SENATE IS 

123
04:27:28,698 --> 04:27:29,265
ABLE TO DO OR WHAT THE 

124
04:27:29,265 --> 04:27:29,832
COMMITTEE IS ABLE TO DO. 

125
04:27:29,832 --> 04:27:30,433
WHY IS IT THAT REPUBLICANS 

126
04:27:30,433 --> 04:27:31,100
AREN'T AS INTERESTED IN AN FBI 

127
04:27:31,100 --> 04:27:31,734
INVESTIGATION AT THE DEMOCRATS 

128
04:27:31,734 --> 04:27:31,934
ARE? 

129
04:27:31,934 --> 04:27:32,535
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE 

130
04:27:32,535 --> 04:27:33,169
LOOKING FOR ONE MORE THING TO 

131
04:27:33,169 --> 04:27:33,503
DELAY THINGS. 

132
04:27:33,503 --> 04:27:34,170
SENATOR BIDEN IS GOING BACK TO 

133
04:27:34,170 --> 04:27:34,704
THE ANITA HILL HEARINGS. 

134
04:27:34,704 --> 04:27:35,238
THE FBI DOESN'T COME TO 

135
04:27:35,238 --> 04:27:35,571
CONCLUSIONS. 

136
04:27:35,571 --> 04:27:36,272
ALL THEY DO IS TAKE TESTIMOY. 

137
04:27:36,272 --> 04:27:36,839
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS 

138
04:27:36,839 --> 04:27:37,473
DOING THAT AND IT'S THE SAME 

139
04:27:37,473 --> 04:27:38,141
THING THAT HAPPENED AFTER ANITA 

140
04:27:38,141 --> 04:27:38,641
HILL'S APPLICATIONS -- 

141
04:27:38,641 --> 04:27:39,275
ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE PUBLIC. 

142
04:27:39,275 --> 04:27:39,942
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE 

143
04:27:39,942 --> 04:27:40,610
THE FBI DO IT WHEN YOU ALREADY 

144
04:27:40,610 --> 04:27:41,277
HAVE THE REAL DECISION-MAKERS 

145
04:27:41,277 --> 04:27:41,778
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 

146
04:27:41,778 --> 04:27:42,412
THAT'S THE SENATORS AND THEY 

147
04:27:42,412 --> 04:27:43,012
HAVE TO BE THE ONES MOVING 

148
04:27:43,012 --> 04:27:43,680
FORWARD TAKING THAT TESTIMONY. 

149
04:27:43,680 --> 04:27:44,247
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN 

150
04:27:44,247 --> 04:27:44,914
INVESTIGATION, PLEASE TAKE PART 

151
04:27:44,914 --> 04:27:45,548
IN THE ONE ACTUALLY HAPPENING 

152
04:27:45,548 --> 04:27:45,948
BEFORE YOUR EYES. 

153
04:27:45,948 --> 04:27:46,582
>> CERTAINLY SOME REPUBLICANS 

154
04:27:46,582 --> 04:27:47,250
EXPRESS WHAT YOU ARE EXPRESSING 

155
04:27:47,250 --> 04:27:47,784
INCLUDING SENATOR LINDSEY 

156
04:27:47,784 --> 04:27:48,418
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA AS A 

157
04:27:48,418 --> 04:27:49,018
DIRECTLY ADDRESS HIS FELLOW 

158
04:27:49,018 --> 04:27:49,285
SENATORS. 

159
04:27:49,285 --> 04:27:49,786
HE WAS VERY EMOTIONAL. 

160
04:27:49,786 --> 04:27:50,486
>> TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, 

161
04:27:50,486 --> 04:27:51,020
IF YOU VOTE NO, YOU'RE 

162
04:27:51,020 --> 04:27:51,521
LEGITIMIZING THE MOST 

163
04:27:51,521 --> 04:27:52,221
DESPICABLE THING I HAVE SEEN IN 

164
04:27:52,221 --> 04:27:52,689
MY TIME IN POLITICS. 

165
04:27:52,689 --> 04:27:53,356
>> AT THIS POINT, AND YOU KNOW 

166
04:27:53,356 --> 04:27:53,990
THERE WERE IF YOU REPUBLICANS 

167
04:27:53,990 --> 04:27:54,524
THAT WERE IN QUESTION.  

168
04:27:54,524 --> 04:27:55,091
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE WAS ONE 

169
04:27:55,091 --> 04:27:55,658
GOING INTO THIS HEARING. 

170
04:27:55,658 --> 04:27:56,125
ARE THERE ANY SENATE 

171
04:27:56,125 --> 04:27:56,759
REPUBLICANS WHO COULD JEOPARDIZE

172
04:27:56,759 --> 04:27:57,360
BRETT KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION? 

173
04:27:57,360 --> 04:27:57,960
>> I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL 

174
04:27:57,960 --> 04:27:58,528
UNDECIDED BUT THERE'S ALSO 

175
04:27:58,528 --> 04:27:59,062
SEVERAL SENATE DEMOCRATS 

176
04:27:59,062 --> 04:27:59,696
UNDECIDED AND YOU HAVE SENATOR 

177
04:27:59,696 --> 04:28:00,329
MANSION, HIGH CAMP, DONNELLY 

178
04:28:00,329 --> 04:28:00,930
WHO HAVE NOT MADE UP THEIR 

179
04:28:00,930 --> 04:28:01,497
MINDS AND IT'S A KEY VOTE. 

180
04:28:01,497 --> 04:28:02,131
IN WEST VIRGINIA, WITH SENATOR 

181
04:28:02,131 --> 04:28:02,765
TED MANSION THEY THINK JUDGE 

182
04:28:02,765 --> 04:28:03,399
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE CONFIRMED 

183
04:28:03,399 --> 04:28:04,067
AND THAT WAS EVEN BEFORE THESE 

184
04:28:04,067 --> 04:28:04,701
HEARINGS WHICH MIGHT PUSH IT 

185
04:28:04,701 --> 04:28:05,268
FATHER AMONG INDEPENDENTS. 

186
04:28:05,268 --> 04:28:05,568
THAT'S 26%. 

187
04:28:05,568 --> 04:28:06,169
IN NORTH DAKOTA, WITH HEIDI 

188
04:28:06,169 --> 04:28:06,836
HEITKAMP, THAT'S A WIDER MARGIN 

189
04:28:06,836 --> 04:28:07,503
WITH 25% OF ALL VOTERS AND 30% 

190
04:28:07,503 --> 04:28:07,837
INDEPENDENCE. 

191
04:28:07,837 --> 04:28:08,471
I THINK A LOT OF THOSE SENATE 

192
04:28:08,471 --> 04:28:09,172
DEMOCRATS WILL BE THINKING HARD.

193
04:28:09,172 --> 04:28:09,706
IF I VOTE AGAINST JUDGE 

194
04:28:09,706 --> 04:28:10,373
KAVANAUGH, IS THIS JUST LOOKING 

195
04:28:10,373 --> 04:28:10,940
LIKE A VOTE FOR A VICIOUS 

196
04:28:10,940 --> 04:28:11,607
CAMPAIGN ORCHESTRATED BY SOME 

197
04:28:11,607 --> 04:28:12,208
OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS TO 

198
04:28:12,208 --> 04:28:12,675
TAINT THE NOMINATION? 

199
04:28:12,675 --> 04:28:13,309
THAT WILL BE A HARD VOTE FOR 

200
04:28:13,309 --> 04:28:14,010
THEM TO WANT TO TAKE IF THEY 

201
04:28:14,010 --> 04:28:14,644
ARE VOTING AGAINST SOMEONE WHO 

202
04:28:14,644 --> 04:28:15,344
BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS JUST ONE OF 

203
04:28:15,344 --> 04:28:15,945
THE MOST QUALIFIED NOMINEES 

204
04:28:15,945 --> 04:28:16,479
EVER FOR THIS POSITION. 

205
04:28:16,479 --> 04:28:17,080
>> IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A 

206
04:28:17,080 --> 04:28:17,346
ROUGH GO. 

207
04:28:17,346 --> 04:28:17,947
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS HAS 

208
04:28:17,947 --> 04:28:18,614
BEEN UGLY, HURTFUL, AND I THINK 

209
04:28:18,614 --> 04:28:19,282
MANY PEOPLE WATCHING PROBABLY 

210
04:28:19,282 --> 04:28:19,949
FELT SYMPATHY FOR BOTH OF THOSE 

211
04:28:19,949 --> 04:28:20,550
PEOPLE TESTIFYING YESTERDAY. 

212
04:28:20,550 --> 04:28:21,150
I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU THINK 

213
04:28:21,150 --> 04:28:21,851
THE IMPACT OF THIS BE -- MAYBE 

214
04:28:21,851 --> 04:28:22,385
MOVING FORWARD IF BRETT 

215
04:28:22,385 --> 04:28:22,919
KAVANAUGH IS CONFIRMED. 

216
04:28:22,919 --> 04:28:23,653
WILL THERE ALWAYS BE SORT OF AN 

217
04:28:23,653 --> 04:28:24,120
ASTERISK BY HIS NAME? 

218
04:28:24,120 --> 04:28:24,787
WILL YOU ALWAYS ASSOCIATE THIS 

219
04:28:24,787 --> 04:28:25,455
WITH THE PROCESS AND IMPACT THE 

220
04:28:25,455 --> 04:28:26,089
WAY WE FEEL ABOUT THE SUPREME 

221
04:28:26,089 --> 04:28:26,322
COURT? 

222
04:28:26,322 --> 04:28:26,989
>> SEEMS TO BE THE GOAL BUT I 

223
04:28:26,989 --> 04:28:27,623
DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE THE 

224
04:28:27,623 --> 04:28:27,990
RESULT FOR THE 

225
04:28:27,990 --> 04:28:28,591
>> WHEN YOU SAID THEIR GOAL 

226
04:28:28,591 --> 04:28:28,958
WHAT YOU MEAN? 

227
04:28:28,958 --> 04:28:29,625
>> I GUESS I MEAN THE DEMOCRATS 

228
04:28:29,625 --> 04:28:29,926
PATH GOAL. 

229
04:28:29,926 --> 04:28:30,526
THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO -- 

230
04:28:30,526 --> 04:28:31,094
DELEGITIMIZE HIS POSITION. 

231
04:28:31,094 --> 04:28:31,761
I WORK FOR JUSTICE THOMAS WHO I 

232
04:28:31,761 --> 04:28:32,328
THINK IS ONE OF THE GREAT 

233
04:28:32,328 --> 04:28:32,929
THINKERS IN THE COURT PEOPLE 

234
04:28:32,929 --> 04:28:33,496
TRY TO DO THAT TO HIM. 

235
04:28:33,496 --> 04:28:34,163
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES KNOW 

236
04:28:34,163 --> 04:28:34,797
BRETT KAVANAUGH VERY WELL AND 

237
04:28:34,797 --> 04:28:35,331
THEY HAVE FOUND HIM VERY 

238
04:28:35,331 --> 04:28:35,665
INFLUENTIAL. 

239
04:28:35,665 --> 04:28:36,165
THEY HAVE INDICATED HIS 

240
04:28:36,165 --> 04:28:36,799
OPINIONS 14 TIMES IN THEIR 

241
04:28:36,799 --> 04:28:37,100
REASONING. 

242
04:28:37,100 --> 04:28:37,734
HE'S A SOMEONE WHO COMMANDS A 

243
04:28:37,734 --> 04:28:38,367
LOT OF RESPECT AND THEY WILL 

244
04:28:38,367 --> 04:28:39,001
HAVE A LOT OF MUTUAL RESPECT 

245
04:28:39,001 --> 04:28:39,602
FOR EACH OTHER EVEN ACROSS 

246
04:28:39,602 --> 04:28:40,169
THE'S IDEOLOGICAL DIVIDES. 

247
04:28:40,169 --> 04:28:40,737
I THINK IT SAYS MORE OF A 

248
04:28:40,737 --> 04:28:41,270
PROBLEM WITH OUR SENATE 

249
04:28:41,270 --> 04:28:41,871
JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION PROCESS 

250
04:28:41,871 --> 04:28:42,505
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. 

251
04:28:42,505 --> 04:28:43,039
THAT'S THE REAL IMPACT. 

252
04:28:43,039 --> 04:28:43,673
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

253
04:28:43,673 --> 04:28:44,307
IS ENGAGED EVEN BEFORE THIS. 

254
04:28:44,307 --> 04:28:44,974
IT WAS ALREADY A CIRCUS THE WAY 

255
04:28:44,974 --> 04:28:45,508
THEY WERE TREATING THIS 

256
04:28:45,508 --> 04:28:46,142
NOMINATION BUT AT THE END OF 

257
04:28:46,142 --> 04:28:46,576
THE DAY ON I THINK 

258
04:28:46,576 --> 04:28:47,210
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS ARE 

259
04:28:47,210 --> 04:28:47,777
GOING TO HAVE A LONG-TERM 

260
04:28:47,777 --> 04:28:48,311
IMPACT ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

261
04:28:48,311 --> 04:28:48,845
OUTSIDE OF THE PARTISAN 

262
04:28:48,845 --> 04:28:49,145
COMMUNITY. 

263
04:28:49,145 --> 04:28:49,812
>>> IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, THE 

264
04:28:49,812 --> 04:28:50,480
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL 

265
04:28:50,480 --> 04:28:50,980
HOLD A VOTE ON BRETT 

266
04:28:50,980 --> 04:28:51,981
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION TO THE ú 

267
04:28:51,981 --> 04:28:52,648
ED O'KEEFE IS ON CAPITOL HILL 

268
04:28:52,648 --> 04:28:53,249
FOLLOWING THOSE DEVELOPMENTS. 

269
04:28:53,249 --> 04:28:53,850
GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT THE 

270
04:28:53,850 --> 04:28:54,450
FEELING IS LIKE ON CAPITOL 

271
04:28:54,450 --> 04:28:54,650
HILL. 

272
04:28:54,650 --> 04:28:55,284
>> Reporter: IT'S NAILBITING 

273
04:28:55,284 --> 04:28:55,985
TIME BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 

274
04:28:55,985 --> 04:28:56,652
WILL TRANSPIRE IN THE JUDICIARY 

275
04:28:56,652 --> 04:28:56,953
COMMITTEE. 

276
04:28:56,953 --> 04:28:57,453
WE THINK THAT ALL 11 

277
04:28:57,453 --> 04:28:58,020
REPUBLICANS WILL VOTE FOR 

278
04:28:58,020 --> 04:28:58,621
KAVANAUGH BUT AT LEAST ONE, 

279
04:28:58,621 --> 04:28:59,255
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA HAS NOT 

280
04:28:59,255 --> 04:28:59,856
SAID WHAT HE PLANS TO DO. 

281
04:28:59,856 --> 04:29:00,523
ANY SECOND THAT COULD BE SOME 

282
04:29:00,523 --> 04:29:01,190
TWEET OR ANNOUNCEMENT FROM HIS 

283
04:29:01,190 --> 04:29:01,724
OFFICE OF HIS INTENTIONS. 

284
04:29:01,724 --> 04:29:02,391
OTHERWISE WE WILL WAIT AND IF 

285
04:29:02,391 --> 04:29:03,059
AND -- IN SUSPENSE. WE EXPECT 

286
04:29:03,059 --> 04:29:03,626
THAT WILL BEGIN WITH SOME 

287
04:29:03,626 --> 04:29:04,227
SQUABBLING BETWEEN THE SIDES 

288
04:29:04,227 --> 04:29:04,894
AND IF YOU WERE STATEMENTS FOR 

289
04:29:04,894 --> 04:29:05,461
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES. 

290
04:29:05,461 --> 04:29:06,028
AT SOME POINT, CHAIRMAN 

291
04:29:06,028 --> 04:29:06,662
GRASSLEY WILL CALL OUT A VOTE. 

292
04:29:06,662 --> 04:29:07,363
EVEN IF HE IS REFERRED OUT OF 

293
04:29:07,363 --> 04:29:07,864
THE COMMITTEE WITHOUT A 

294
04:29:07,864 --> 04:29:08,397
POSITIVE VOTE, REPORTED 

295
04:29:08,397 --> 04:29:09,065
UNFAVORABLY, AS THEY SAY IN THE 

296
04:29:09,065 --> 04:29:09,665
SENATE, MAJORITY LEADER MITCH 

297
04:29:09,665 --> 04:29:10,366
McCONNELL SAYS HE'S BRINGING IT 

298
04:29:10,366 --> 04:29:11,067
TO THE FULL SENATE AND A SERIES 

299
04:29:11,067 --> 04:29:11,667
OF PROCEDURAL MOVES THAT ARE 

300
04:29:11,667 --> 04:29:12,268
LIKELY TO START ON SATURDAY 

301
04:29:12,268 --> 04:29:12,869
MORNING AND WOULD LEAD TO A 

302
04:29:12,869 --> 04:29:13,302
VOTE ON TUESDAY. 

303
04:29:13,302 --> 04:29:13,970
AGAIN, IN ADDITION TO FLAKE WE 

304
04:29:13,970 --> 04:29:14,637
ARE WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT SUSAN 

305
04:29:14,637 --> 04:29:15,204
COLLINS OF MAINE AND LISA 

306
04:29:15,204 --> 04:29:15,905
MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND WE WILL 

307
04:29:15,905 --> 04:29:16,539
SEE IF ANY DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY 

308
04:29:16,539 --> 04:29:17,140
SIGN UP FOR THIS, AS WELL. 

309
04:29:17,140 --> 04:29:17,640
>> ANYBODY WHO WATCHED 

310
04:29:17,640 --> 04:29:18,274
YESTERDAY'S TESTIMONY PROBABLY 

311
04:29:18,274 --> 04:29:18,808
WALKED AWAY EMOTIONALLY 

312
04:29:18,808 --> 04:29:19,108
EXHAUSTED. 

313
04:29:19,108 --> 04:29:19,742
IT'S BEEN A REALLY EXHAUSTIVE 

314
04:29:19,742 --> 04:29:20,009
PROCESS. 

315
04:29:20,009 --> 04:29:20,543
I WONDER IF ANY OF THE 

316
04:29:20,543 --> 04:29:21,177
LAWMAKERS YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO 

317
04:29:21,177 --> 04:29:21,811
HAVE DISCUSSED HOW THEY FEEL 

318
04:29:21,811 --> 04:29:22,445
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE 

319
04:29:22,445 --> 04:29:23,079
NOMINATION PROCESS AND HOW IT 

320
04:29:23,079 --> 04:29:23,713
LOOKS AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 

321
04:29:23,713 --> 04:29:24,013
WATCHES ON. 

322
04:29:24,013 --> 04:29:24,680
>> I RAN INTO COREY BOOKER OF 

323
04:29:24,680 --> 04:29:25,248
NEW JERSEY LAST NIGHT AFTER 

324
04:29:25,248 --> 04:29:25,915
THIS HAD ENDED AND I SAID, WHAT 

325
04:29:25,915 --> 04:29:26,415
DID YOU MAKE OF THIS? 

326
04:29:26,415 --> 04:29:27,016
IS THIS A MOMENT THAT WILL 

327
04:29:27,016 --> 04:29:27,650
STAND OUT IN YOUR MEMORY IN 

328
04:29:27,650 --> 04:29:27,950
PERPETUITY? 

329
04:29:27,950 --> 04:29:28,584
HE SAID THERE WASN'T ANYTHING 

330
04:29:28,584 --> 04:29:29,051
TERRIBLY MEMORABLE. 

331
04:29:29,051 --> 04:29:29,719
HE SAID, I KNOW TALKING TO MY 

332
04:29:29,719 --> 04:29:30,319
COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES AND 

333
04:29:30,319 --> 04:29:31,020
THAT THIS WAS SORT OF SICK AND 

334
04:29:31,020 --> 04:29:31,554
SAD AND I THINK THAT THE 

335
04:29:31,554 --> 04:29:32,188
GENERAL PERCEPTION THAT A LOT 

336
04:29:32,188 --> 04:29:32,822
OF PEOPLE HAD APPEAR YESTERDAY 

337
04:29:32,822 --> 04:29:33,389
AND AFTER AND DURING EIGHT 

338
04:29:33,389 --> 04:29:34,023
HOURS AND 45 MINUTES OF THAT. 

339
04:29:34,023 --> 04:29:34,724
THIS IS JUST NOT A GOOD MOMENT 

340
04:29:34,724 --> 04:29:35,291
FOR THE SENATE, NOT A GOOD 

341
04:29:35,291 --> 04:29:35,958
MOMENT FOR CONGRESS, NOT A GOOD 

342
04:29:35,958 --> 04:29:36,592
MOMENT FOR THE COUNTRY AT ALL 

343
04:29:36,592 --> 04:29:37,026
BECAUSE YOU HAD THE 

344
04:29:37,026 --> 04:29:37,560
INTERSECTION OF PARTISAN 

345
04:29:37,560 --> 04:29:38,194
POLITICS, THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, 

346
04:29:38,194 --> 04:29:38,861
THE CLASSIC UNIVERSAL, HE SAID, 

347
04:29:38,861 --> 04:29:39,128
SHE SAID. 

348
04:29:39,128 --> 04:29:39,729
JUST GENERAL NASTINESS THAT 

349
04:29:39,729 --> 04:29:40,363
PERVADES WASHINGTON THESE DAYS. 

350
04:29:40,363 --> 04:29:40,696
>> SO TRUE. 

351
04:29:40,696 --> 04:29:40,997
THANK YOU. 

352
04:29:40,997 --> 04:29:41,631
>>> WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY FROM 

353
04:29:41,631 --> 04:29:42,098
THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

354
04:29:42,098 --> 04:29:42,698
COMMITTEE'S EXPECTED VOTES. 

355
04:29:42,698 --> 04:29:43,366
THE REPUBLICANS HOLD A ONE SEAT 

356
04:29:43,366 --> 04:29:44,000
ADVANTAGE ON THE COMMITTEE AND 

357
04:29:44,000 --> 04:29:44,667
THAT WAS SENT KAVANAUGH TO THE 

358
04:29:44,667 --> 04:29:45,234
FULL SENATE AFTER THAT FOR 

359
04:29:45,234 --> 04:29:45,802
VOTING ALONG PARTY LINES. 

360
04:29:45,802 --> 04:29:46,435
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER 

361
04:29:46,435 --> 04:29:47,069
TESTIFIED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE 

362
04:29:47,069 --> 04:29:47,370
YESTERDAY. 

363
04:29:47,370 --> 04:29:47,904
LAWMAKERS ARE GATHERING 

364
04:29:47,904 --> 04:29:48,538
CHITCHATTING AHEAD OF THE VOTE 

365
04:29:48,538 --> 04:29:49,205
TODAY AND AS YOU HEARD FROM ED 

366
04:29:49,205 --> 04:29:49,806
O'KEEFE AND NANCY CORDES, THE 

367
04:29:49,806 --> 04:29:50,473
EXPECTATION IS BEFORE THEY VOTE 

368
04:29:50,473 --> 04:29:51,107
THEY WILL HAVE A LOT TO SAY. 

369
04:29:51,107 --> 04:29:51,774
IF YESTERDAY WAS ANY INDICATION 

370
04:29:51,774 --> 04:29:52,408
OF WHAT WE WILL SEE TODAY, 

371
04:29:52,408 --> 04:29:53,075
PERHAPS THEY ARE EXHAUSTED, WE 

372
04:29:53,075 --> 04:29:53,743
WILL PROBABLY HEAR SOME SIMILAR 

373
04:29:53,743 --> 04:29:54,310
REQUESTS FROM THE DEMOCRATS 

374
04:29:54,310 --> 04:29:54,911
ABOUT AN FBI INVESTIGATION, 

375
04:29:54,911 --> 04:29:55,378
FARM THE REPUBLICANS 

376
04:29:55,378 --> 04:29:55,845
COMPLAINING ABOUT AN 

377
04:29:55,845 --> 04:29:56,412
INTENTIONAL DELAY OF THIS 

378
04:29:56,412 --> 04:29:56,946
NOMINEE MOVING FORWARD. 

379
04:29:56,946 --> 04:29:57,647
>>> WE ARE JOINED BY REPUBLICAN 

380
04:29:57,647 --> 04:29:58,247
STRATEGIST LESLIE SANCHEZ AND 

381
04:29:58,247 --> 04:29:58,815
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST JOEL 

382
04:29:58,815 --> 04:29:59,048
PAYNE. 

383
04:29:59,048 --> 04:29:59,615
I'M EMOTIONALLY SPENT AND I 

384
04:29:59,615 --> 04:30:00,183
DIDN'T TESTIFY YESTERDAY. 

385
04:30:00,183 --> 04:30:00,850
>> I THINK THAT'S THE SENTIMENT 

386
04:30:00,850 --> 04:30:01,184
OF SO MANY. 

387
04:30:01,184 --> 04:30:01,751
THE THING ABOUT DR. FORD'S 

388
04:30:01,751 --> 04:30:02,318
TESTIMONY IS IT UNEARTHED 

389
04:30:02,318 --> 04:30:02,819
CONFLICTING, EMOTIONAL 

390
04:30:02,819 --> 04:30:03,452
REACTIONS FROM WOMEN OF MANY 

391
04:30:03,452 --> 04:30:03,786
GENERATIONS. 

392
04:30:03,786 --> 04:30:04,420
THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS 

393
04:30:04,420 --> 04:30:05,087
ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT, WHAT WAS 

394
04:30:05,087 --> 04:30:05,688
ACCEPTED AND EVERYBODY KNOWS 

395
04:30:05,688 --> 04:30:06,222
THAT FRATERNITY TYPE OF 

396
04:30:06,222 --> 04:30:06,489
CULTURE. 

397
04:30:06,489 --> 04:30:07,190
IT HARKENS BACK TO WHETHER IT'S 

398
04:30:07,190 --> 04:30:07,824
A FAIR CONNECTION OR NOT AND 

399
04:30:07,824 --> 04:30:08,391
BECAUSE OF THAT, IT HAS A 

400
04:30:08,391 --> 04:30:08,991
LINGERING EFFECT AND IT'S A 

401
04:30:08,991 --> 04:30:09,659
FREQUENCY THAT I THINK A LOT OF 

402
04:30:09,659 --> 04:30:10,259
WOMEN IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND. 

403
04:30:10,259 --> 04:30:10,793
FOR THAT REASON, IF FOR 

404
04:30:10,793 --> 04:30:11,394
KAVANAUGH MOVES FORWARD THERE 

405
04:30:11,394 --> 04:30:12,028
WILL ALWAYS BE THIS SUSPICION 

406
04:30:12,028 --> 04:30:12,595
AND HIS HYPERPARTISANSHIP. 

407
04:30:12,595 --> 04:30:13,262
WE KNOW REPUBLICANS ARE MOVING 

408
04:30:13,262 --> 04:30:13,863
THIS THROUGH POLITICALLY TO 

409
04:30:13,863 --> 04:30:14,564
SAVE THEMSELVES IN THE MIDTERMS 

410
04:30:14,564 --> 04:30:15,131
BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED TO 

411
04:30:15,131 --> 04:30:15,731
HAVING THESE ON THE SUPREME 

412
04:30:15,731 --> 04:30:16,332
COURT BUT AT WHAT EXPENSE? 

413
04:30:16,332 --> 04:30:16,999
THAT WILL BE MY CAUTION TO THE 

414
04:30:16,999 --> 04:30:17,633
REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE THIS 

415
04:30:17,633 --> 04:30:18,067
WILL NOT GO AWAY. 

416
04:30:18,067 --> 04:30:18,768
IS THIS REALLY THE BEST WE CAN 

417
04:30:18,768 --> 04:30:18,935
DO? 

418
04:30:18,935 --> 04:30:19,602
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. 

419
04:30:19,602 --> 04:30:20,236
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 

420
04:30:20,236 --> 04:30:20,870
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AS I 

421
04:30:20,870 --> 04:30:21,537
SAW THE RHETORIC HEATING UP AND 

422
04:30:21,537 --> 04:30:22,205
PEOPLE BECOMING MORE PASSIONATE 

423
04:30:22,205 --> 04:30:22,805
AND UNDERSTANDING THIS WAS A 

424
04:30:22,805 --> 04:30:23,339
CAMPAIGN PROMISE AND THE 

425
04:30:23,339 --> 04:30:24,006
PRESIDENT REALLY WANTED TO BE 

426
04:30:24,006 --> 04:30:24,574
ABLE TO DELIVER ON THIS 

427
04:30:24,574 --> 04:30:24,841
PROMISE. 

428
04:30:24,841 --> 04:30:25,441
WILL THEY WIN THE BATTLE AND 

429
04:30:25,441 --> 04:30:26,008
THAT THEY GOT KAVANAUGH? 

430
04:30:26,008 --> 04:30:26,676
BUT LOSE THE WAR BECAUSE PEOPLE 

431
04:30:26,676 --> 04:30:27,210
ARE FIRED UP ABOUT THIS. 

432
04:30:27,210 --> 04:30:27,910
JOAL, WHAT YOUR TAKE ON HOW THE 

433
04:30:27,910 --> 04:30:28,511
DEMOCRATS HANDLED THEMSELVES? 

434
04:30:28,511 --> 04:30:29,045
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS 

435
04:30:29,045 --> 04:30:29,712
ACQUITTED THEMSELVES RELATIVELY 

436
04:30:29,712 --> 04:30:29,912
WELL. 

437
04:30:29,912 --> 04:30:30,546
THIS WAS NOT SET UP TO MAKE 

438
04:30:30,546 --> 04:30:31,180
ANYBODY REALLY LOOKED GREAT. 

439
04:30:31,180 --> 04:30:31,814
THIS WAS NOT SET UP OBVIOUSLY 

440
04:30:31,814 --> 04:30:32,415
-- I THINK THE ONE THING WE 

441
04:30:32,415 --> 04:30:33,082
ACCOMPLISHED YESTERDAY IS THAT 

442
04:30:33,082 --> 04:30:33,716
THE SENATE FIGURED OUT HOW TO 

443
04:30:33,716 --> 04:30:34,417
NOT REDO ANITA HILL FROM 25, 30 

444
04:30:34,417 --> 04:30:34,717
YEARS AGO. 

445
04:30:34,717 --> 04:30:35,351
I THINK EVERYBODY WENT OUT-OF-

446
04:30:35,351 --> 04:30:36,052
THE-WAY TO NOT HAVE A REPLAY OF 

447
04:30:36,052 --> 04:30:36,752
THAT AND WE WILL TREAT DR. FORD 

448
04:30:36,752 --> 04:30:37,119
WITH RESPECT.  

449
04:30:37,119 --> 04:30:37,787
WE ARE GOING TO TREAT HER WITH 

450
04:30:37,787 --> 04:30:38,387
A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CARE AND 

451
04:30:38,387 --> 04:30:38,654
CONCERN. 

452
04:30:38,654 --> 04:30:39,355
I WILL SAY THAT IT DOES APPEAR 

453
04:30:39,355 --> 04:30:40,022
THAT EVERYBODY WENT OUT-OF-THE-

454
04:30:40,022 --> 04:30:40,656
WAY IN THAT HEARING ROOM AND 

455
04:30:40,656 --> 04:30:41,257
EVEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN HIS 

456
04:30:41,257 --> 04:30:41,557
TESTIMONY. 

457
04:30:41,557 --> 04:30:42,191
HE DID NOT REALLY GO OUT -- 

458
04:30:42,191 --> 04:30:42,792
WHILE HE DENIED HE WAS THE 

459
04:30:42,792 --> 04:30:43,359
PERSON THAT SHE WAS TALKING 

460
04:30:43,359 --> 04:30:43,893
ABOUT, HE DID NOT CAST 

461
04:30:43,893 --> 04:30:44,460
ASPERSIONS ON WHAT SHE WAS 

462
04:30:44,460 --> 04:30:45,061
SAYING ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE. 

463
04:30:45,061 --> 04:30:45,728
I DO THINK THAT THE SIGNIFICANT 

464
04:30:45,728 --> 04:30:46,295
AND IT'S TELLING ABOUT THE 

465
04:30:46,295 --> 04:30:46,929
MOMENT WE ARE IN, LESLIE, THAT 

466
04:30:46,929 --> 04:30:47,563
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IN 

467
04:30:47,563 --> 04:30:48,197
2018 IS AN OKAY THING TO DO. 

468
04:30:48,197 --> 04:30:48,865
PEOPLE ARE NOT OKAY WITH THAT. 

469
04:30:48,865 --> 04:30:49,532
>> I FEEL LIKE I HEARD ECHOES 

470
04:30:49,532 --> 04:30:49,799
OF THAT. 

471
04:30:49,799 --> 04:30:50,333
WE DID NOT SEE ANY OTHER 

472
04:30:50,333 --> 04:30:50,967
TESTIMONY FROM ANYBODY ELSE. 

473
04:30:50,967 --> 04:30:51,634
I AM PICKING OUT SOME PHRASES. 

474
04:30:51,634 --> 04:30:52,268
JUDGE KAVANAUGH CALLED THIS A 

475
04:30:52,268 --> 04:30:52,802
CALCULATED, ORCHESTRATED, 

476
04:30:52,802 --> 04:30:53,436
POLITICAL HIT AND I THOUGHT OF 

477
04:30:53,436 --> 04:30:53,903
HIGH TECH LYNCHING. 

478
04:30:53,903 --> 04:30:54,637
THEY BOTH CALLED IT A CIRCUS IN 

479
04:30:54,637 --> 04:30:55,171
THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS. 

480
04:30:55,171 --> 04:30:55,771
JUSTICE THOMAS AND KAVANAUGH 

481
04:30:55,771 --> 04:30:56,339
CALLED IT A CIRCUS AND A 

482
04:30:56,339 --> 04:30:56,606
DISGRACE. 

483
04:30:56,606 --> 04:30:57,240
I DID HEAR LITTLE ECHOES AND 

484
04:30:57,240 --> 04:30:57,707
MAYBE THAT'S JUST A 

485
04:30:57,707 --> 04:30:58,040
COINCIDENCE. 

486
04:30:58,040 --> 04:30:58,674
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT 

487
04:30:58,674 --> 04:30:59,308
THE FACT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

488
04:30:59,308 --> 04:30:59,942
-- I THINK LESLIE'S PROBABLY 

489
04:30:59,942 --> 04:31:00,643
RIGHT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN 

490
04:31:00,643 --> 04:31:01,344
NOT THAT HE WILL BE CONFIRMED. 

491
04:31:01,344 --> 04:31:01,978
THE JOB OF THESE FOLKS IS TO 

492
04:31:01,978 --> 04:31:02,612
GET IT RIGHT AND KNOW HOW TO 

493
04:31:02,612 --> 04:31:03,279
COUNT TO PICK A MITCH McCONNELL 

494
04:31:03,279 --> 04:31:03,746
KNOWS HOW TO COUNT. 

495
04:31:03,746 --> 04:31:04,380
IT HAS JUST COME OUT IN THE 

496
04:31:04,380 --> 04:31:04,981
LAST FEW MINUTES JEFF FLAKE 

497
04:31:04,981 --> 04:31:05,414
WILL BE A YES VOTE. 

498
04:31:05,414 --> 04:31:06,048
THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE AND HE 

499
04:31:06,048 --> 04:31:06,649
WOULDN'T HAVE PUT THAT UP 

500
04:31:06,649 --> 04:31:07,316
UNLESS HE KNEW THAT JEFF FLAKE 

501
04:31:07,316 --> 04:31:07,717
WOULD BE A YES. 

502
04:31:07,717 --> 04:31:08,317
JUST THE IDEA THAT SENATE 

503
04:31:08,317 --> 04:31:08,918
REPUBLICANS FELT COMFORTABLE 

504
04:31:08,918 --> 04:31:09,585
ENOUGH TO DO THAT, I THINK IT 

505
04:31:09,585 --> 04:31:10,253
TELLS ABOUT HOW THEY FELT ABOUT 

506
04:31:10,253 --> 04:31:10,753
THE HEARING YESTERDAY. 

507
04:31:10,753 --> 04:31:11,454
THEY PASS THE LITMUS TEST TO AT 

508
04:31:11,454 --> 04:31:12,088
LEAST GET BRETT KAVANAUGH OVER 

509
04:31:12,088 --> 04:31:12,655
THE HUMP BUT I DON'T THINK 

510
04:31:12,655 --> 04:31:13,289
BRETT KAVANAUGH PASSED TO THE 

511
04:31:13,289 --> 04:31:13,723
SUPREME COURT TEST. 

512
04:31:13,723 --> 04:31:14,357
WHILE HE MAY HAVE PASSED THE 

513
04:31:14,357 --> 04:31:14,924
BELIEVABILITY THRESHOLD AND 

514
04:31:14,924 --> 04:31:15,524
DEFEND HIMSELF AND MAY HAVE 

515
04:31:15,524 --> 04:31:16,192
MADE THE AUDIENCE IN THE WHITE 

516
04:31:16,192 --> 04:31:16,859
HOUSE HAPPY, I DON'T BELIEVE HE 

517
04:31:16,859 --> 04:31:17,493
COMPORTED HIMSELF AS A SUPREME 

518
04:31:17,493 --> 04:31:18,060
COURT JUSTICE BECAUSE AS A 

519
04:31:18,060 --> 04:31:18,728
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, YOU HAVE 

520
04:31:18,728 --> 04:31:19,128
TO BE IMPARTIAL. 

521
04:31:19,128 --> 04:31:19,829
<u>OU HAVE TO HAVE </u>

522
04:31:19,829 --> 04:31:20,396
I DIDN'T MAKE A DECISION. 

523
04:31:20,396 --> 04:31:20,997
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CLINTON 

524
04:31:20,997 --> 04:31:21,664
MONEY, THE CLINTON LEFTISTS AND 

525
04:31:21,664 --> 04:31:22,365
THAT IS NOT REALLY CONDUCT OF A 

526
04:31:22,365 --> 04:31:22,865
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 

527
04:31:22,865 --> 04:31:23,332
>> HE IS UNBIASED. 

528
04:31:23,332 --> 04:31:24,000
HE HAS WRITTEN 300 OPINIONS AND 

529
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:24,567
THERE'S A LONG RECORD BUT 

530
04:31:24,567 --> 04:31:25,902
THERE'S ALMOST 2 SIDES TO BRETT 

531
04:31:25,902 --> 04:31:26,535
HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF. 

532
04:31:26,535 --> 04:31:27,103
THERE'S THIS ONE, YOUNG, 

533
04:31:27,103 --> 04:31:27,737
EXUBERANT, DRINKING -- HE WAS 

534
04:31:27,737 --> 04:31:28,170
MAD AND EMOTIONAL. 

535
04:31:28,170 --> 04:31:28,738
HIS TEMPERAMENT I DO FEEL 

536
04:31:28,738 --> 04:31:29,405
DISQUALIFIED HIM BECAUSE OF THE 

537
04:31:29,405 --> 04:31:29,805
WAY HE BEHAVED. 

538
04:31:29,805 --> 04:31:30,439
IF THAT WAS A WOMAN, SHE WOULD 

539
04:31:30,439 --> 04:31:30,706
BE GONE. 

540
04:31:30,706 --> 04:31:31,440
THIS DOUBLE STANDARD -- WE HAVE 

541
04:31:31,440 --> 04:31:32,108
TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND LAY THAT 

542
04:31:32,108 --> 04:31:32,808
OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE EXPECT 

543
04:31:32,808 --> 04:31:33,442
OUR SUPREME COURT TO LOOK OUT 

544
04:31:33,442 --> 04:31:33,709
-- LIKE. 

545
04:31:33,709 --> 04:31:34,410
DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THIS KIND 

546
04:31:34,410 --> 04:31:34,677
OF THING? 

547
04:31:34,677 --> 04:31:35,344
IF WE SLOWED IT DOWN A BEETS, 

548
04:31:35,344 --> 04:31:35,878
AND MIGHT HAVE A NATURAL 

549
04:31:35,878 --> 04:31:36,545
CONCLUSION AND NOW I SOUND LIKE 

550
04:31:36,545 --> 04:31:37,113
THESE CONSERVATIVES GETTING 

551
04:31:37,113 --> 04:31:37,313
MAD. 

552
04:31:37,313 --> 04:31:37,947
WE WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. 

553
04:31:37,947 --> 04:31:38,547
>> LET'S LISTEN AND BECAUSE 

554
04:31:38,547 --> 04:31:39,148
LAWMAKERS ARE TALKING NOW.>> 

555
04:31:39,148 --> 04:31:39,815
IT'S A SHAME. I THINK SHE MADE 

556
04:31:39,815 --> 04:31:40,216
A GOOD WITNESS. 

557
04:31:40,216 --> 04:31:40,816
I LIKED HER AND THERE COMES A 

558
04:31:40,816 --> 04:31:41,517
TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S 

559
04:31:41,517 --> 04:31:42,151
RIGHT AND MAKE A GREAT JUDGE. 

560
04:31:42,151 --> 04:31:42,752
>> TO YOU STILL BELIEVE THE 

561
04:31:42,752 --> 04:31:43,252
ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 

562
04:31:43,252 --> 04:31:43,586
INVESTIGATED? 

563
04:31:43,586 --> 04:31:44,153
>> I THINK SHE'S MISTAKEN. 

564
04:31:44,153 --> 04:31:44,787
WITH ALL THAT I KNOW, I THINK 

565
04:31:44,787 --> 04:31:45,454
SHE'S MISTAKEN AND I DO BELIEVE 

566
04:31:45,454 --> 04:31:45,755
KAVANAUGH. 

567
04:31:45,755 --> 04:31:46,389
HE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER AND A 

568
04:31:46,389 --> 04:31:46,789
VERY FINE MAN. 

569
04:31:46,789 --> 04:31:47,390
I THINK SHE'S A FINE WOMAN, 

570
04:31:47,390 --> 04:31:48,057
TOO, SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS 

571
04:31:48,057 --> 04:31:48,357
DIFFICULT. 

572
04:31:48,357 --> 04:31:48,958
>> APPRECIATE IT, EVERYBODY. 

573
04:31:48,958 --> 04:31:49,258
THANK YOU. 

574
04:31:49,258 --> 04:31:49,926
>>> WE WOULD JUST HEARING FROM 

575
04:31:49,926 --> 04:31:50,526
ORRIN HACH AND HE EXPRESSED 

576
04:31:50,526 --> 04:31:51,193
SOMETHING WE HAVE HEARD FROM A 

577
04:31:51,193 --> 04:31:51,794
LOT OF OTHER REPUBLICANS AND 

578
04:31:51,794 --> 04:31:52,395
HOW THEY RECONCILE THESE TWO 

579
04:31:52,395 --> 04:31:52,995
COMPLETELY OPPOSING STORIES. 

580
04:31:52,995 --> 04:31:53,596
JUDGE KAVANAUGH STUCK TO HIS 

581
04:31:53,596 --> 04:31:54,230
STORY THAT HE WAS NEVER AT AN 

582
04:31:54,230 --> 04:31:54,630
EVENT LIKE THAT. 

583
04:31:54,630 --> 04:31:55,131
HE DOESN'T KNOW HER. 

584
04:31:55,131 --> 04:31:55,831
NOT EVEN THAT THEY WERE CASUAL 

585
04:31:55,831 --> 04:31:56,499
FRIENDS AT ALL AND SHE SAYS SHE 

586
04:31:56,499 --> 04:31:57,133
WAS 100% SURE HE WAS THE ONE 

587
04:31:57,133 --> 04:31:57,600
THAT ASSAULTED HER. 

588
04:31:57,600 --> 04:31:58,267
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL FLY 

589
04:31:58,267 --> 04:31:58,834
AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THE 

590
04:31:58,834 --> 04:31:59,368
MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND THE 

591
04:31:59,368 --> 04:31:59,936
PUBLIC WILL EMBRACE THAT? 

592
04:31:59,936 --> 04:32:00,603
>> FROM THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE 

593
04:32:00,603 --> 04:32:01,237
AND THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS THEY 

594
04:32:01,237 --> 04:32:01,804
WILL BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT 

595
04:32:01,804 --> 04:32:02,104
DELIVERED. 

596
04:32:02,104 --> 04:32:02,638
>> HOLD THAT THOUGHT. 

597
04:32:02,638 --> 04:32:03,306
>> IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WE 

598
04:32:03,306 --> 04:32:03,973
ARE NOT PREPARED TO DEAL WITH 

599
04:32:03,973 --> 04:32:04,507
OR SUPPORT WOMEN WHO ARE 

600
04:32:04,507 --> 04:32:05,074
SURVIVORS OF THIS KIND OF 

601
04:32:05,074 --> 04:32:05,708
HORRIFIC ACT IN A VERY GOOD 

602
04:32:05,708 --> 04:32:05,908
WAY. 

603
04:32:05,908 --> 04:32:06,575
WHAT IS THE MOST TELLING OF ALL 

604
04:32:06,575 --> 04:32:07,243
IS THAT THEY WILL NOT GO FOR A 

605
04:32:07,243 --> 04:32:07,810
INVESTIGATION BY A NEUTRAL 

606
04:32:07,810 --> 04:32:08,377
ENTITY WHICH IS THE FBI. 

607
04:32:08,377 --> 04:32:08,911
THEY WILL NOT GO THERE. 

608
04:32:08,911 --> 04:32:09,445
THAT IS VERY TELLING. 

609
04:32:09,445 --> 04:32:10,012
FRANKLY, IF THE REPUBLICANS 

610
04:32:10,012 --> 04:32:10,613
THINK THAT COMMITTEE PEOPLE 

611
04:32:10,613 --> 04:32:11,180
DOING THE INVESTIGATION IS 

612
04:32:11,180 --> 04:32:11,881
EQUIVALENT TO THE FBI, GIVE ME 

613
04:32:11,881 --> 04:32:12,481
A BREAK.>> IF DEMOCRATS TAKE 

614
04:32:12,481 --> 04:32:13,115
BACK THE SENATE WOULD YOU BE 

615
04:32:13,115 --> 04:32:13,716
SUPPORTIVE OF LOOKING INTO 

616
04:32:13,716 --> 04:32:14,283
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH ONCE 

617
04:32:14,283 --> 04:32:14,517
AGAIN? 

618
04:32:14,517 --> 04:32:15,151
>> WE ARE NOT THERE YET AND I 

619
04:32:15,151 --> 04:32:15,818
AM TOTALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT WE 

620
04:32:15,818 --> 04:32:16,152
NEED TO DO. 

621
04:32:16,152 --> 04:32:16,752
GOING FORWARD EVEN IF JUDGE 

622
04:32:16,752 --> 04:32:17,353
KAVANAUGH IS CONFIRMED UNDER 

623
04:32:17,353 --> 04:32:17,987
THIS KIND OF A HUGE CLOUD IS 

624
04:32:17,987 --> 04:32:18,621
BAD ENOUGH THAT WE SENT ONE 

625
04:32:18,621 --> 04:32:19,188
PERSON TO THE SUPREME COURT 

626
04:32:19,188 --> 04:32:19,822
WITH THIS KIND OF CLOUD WE 

627
04:32:19,822 --> 04:32:20,423
SHOULD NOT BE SENDING BOTH. 

628
04:32:20,423 --> 04:32:21,023
AS I HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR 

629
04:32:21,023 --> 04:32:21,724
MONTHS AND ALERTING EVERYONE TO 

630
04:32:21,724 --> 04:32:22,391
THE COURT PACKING THAT IS GOING 

631
04:32:22,391 --> 04:32:23,059
ON WITH THE JUDGES WHO WERE SO 

632
04:32:23,059 --> 04:32:23,592
IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN AND 

633
04:32:23,592 --> 04:32:24,293
OUTCOME DRIVEN THAT THAT IS NOT 

634
04:32:24,293 --> 04:32:24,860
GOOD FOR THE COURT, WHICH 

635
04:32:24,860 --> 04:32:25,494
SHOULD BE PEOPLE WITH -- I 

636
04:32:25,494 --> 04:32:26,162
DON'T MIND IF THE CONSERVATIVE 

637
04:32:26,162 --> 04:32:26,796
AS LONG AS I CAN BE ASSURED 

638
04:32:26,796 --> 04:32:27,363
THAT THEY CAN BE FAIR AND 

639
04:32:27,363 --> 04:32:27,663
IMPARTIAL. 

640
04:32:27,663 --> 04:32:28,297
AND TOO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE 

641
04:32:28,297 --> 04:32:28,864
WHO ARE REALLY FEDERALIST 

642
04:32:28,864 --> 04:32:29,532
SOCIETY AND HERITAGE FOUNDATION 

643
04:32:29,532 --> 04:32:30,199
ANOINTED PEOPLE HAVE AN OUTCOME 

644
04:32:30,199 --> 04:32:30,866
DRIVEN AGENDA AND THAT IS NOT 

645
04:32:30,866 --> 04:32:31,467
WHERE WE SHOULD BE FOR THE 

646
04:32:31,467 --> 04:32:32,001
>> I'M NOT RESIGNED TO 

647
04:32:32,001 --> 04:32:32,268
ANYTHING. 

648
04:32:32,268 --> 04:32:32,902
I WILL JUST KEEP ON GOING. 

649
04:32:32,902 --> 04:32:33,602
THERE'S OTHERS I WILL HOPE WILL 

650
04:32:33,602 --> 04:32:34,236
SEARCH THEIR SOULS AND DO THE 

651
04:32:34,236 --> 04:32:34,870
RIGHT THING FOR THE COURT, THE 

652
04:32:34,870 --> 04:32:35,504
COUNTRY, AND ALL THE WOMEN AND 

653
04:32:35,504 --> 04:32:36,072
SURVIVORS IN THIS COUNTRY. 

654
04:32:36,072 --> 04:32:36,772
>> AS PROMISED, AS SOON AS THE 

655
04:32:36,772 --> 04:32:37,473
VOTE STARTED, WE WOULD TAKE YOU 

656
04:32:37,473 --> 04:32:38,140
THERE ALIVE SO I WILL HAVE YOU 

657
04:32:38,140 --> 04:32:38,374
LISTEN. 

658
04:32:38,374 --> 04:32:39,008
>>> WE WERE HAVING A LOT OF 

659
04:32:39,008 --> 04:32:39,675
EMOTIONS FROM -- CAN WE HAVE 

660
04:32:39,675 --> 04:32:40,109
QUIET FROM THE AUDIENCE.

661
04:32:40,443 --> 04:32:41,043
IS THERE SOMEBODY THAT CAN 

662
04:32:41,043 --> 04:32:41,711
SIGNAL TO ME THAT THE CHAIRS 

663
04:32:41,711 --> 04:32:42,411
ARE FILLED AND THAT WE CAN HAVE 

664
04:32:42,411 --> 04:32:42,912
SOME PEACE AND QUIET? 

665
04:32:42,912 --> 04:32:43,479
I'D LIKE TO START OUT TODAY 

666
04:32:43,479 --> 04:32:44,146
WHERE WE LEFT OFF ON SEPTEMBER 

667
04:32:44,146 --> 04:32:44,313
13. 

668
04:32:44,313 --> 04:32:44,981
ALTHOUGH THIS IS A NEW MEETING, 

669
04:32:44,981 --> 04:32:45,648
BUT I WAS ANTICIPATING A LOT OF 

670
04:32:45,648 --> 04:32:46,315
EMOTIONS FROM THE MINORITY AND 

671
04:32:46,315 --> 04:32:47,016
WE DID HAVE SOME EMOTIONS FROM 

672
04:32:47,016 --> 04:32:47,550
THE MINORITY BUT IF YOU 

673
04:32:47,550 --> 04:32:48,184
REMEMBER, I SAID I WILL GIVE 

674
04:32:48,184 --> 04:32:48,851
THE MINORITY A CHANCE TO MAKE 

675
04:32:48,851 --> 04:32:49,452
THEIR MOTIONS AND THAT I WAS 

676
04:32:49,452 --> 04:32:50,152
GOING TO MAKE A MOTION THAT WE 

677
04:32:50,152 --> 04:32:50,786
HAVE A TIME CERTAIN TO VOTE. 

678
04:32:50,786 --> 04:32:51,520
I WANT TO MAKE THAT MOTION TIME 

679
04:32:51,520 --> 04:32:52,188
CERTAIN TO VOTE BUT IF THERE'S 

680
04:32:52,188 --> 04:32:52,788
A MOTION FROM A MINORITY, I 

681
04:32:52,788 --> 04:32:53,389
WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT MOTION 

682
04:32:53,389 --> 04:32:54,056
FIRST.>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD 

683
04:32:54,056 --> 04:32:54,623

SUBPOENA MARK JUDGES A WITNESS 

685

BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE. 

686
04:32:55,758 --> 04:32:56,492
>> LET ME -- HOLD ON A MINUTE. 

687
04:32:56,492 --> 04:32:57,093
COULD YOU MAKE YOUR REMARKS 

688
04:32:57,093 --> 04:32:57,760
SHORT, PLEASE AND SPEAK NOW AND 

689
04:32:57,760 --> 04:32:58,094
WE WILL VOTE. 

690
04:32:58,094 --> 04:32:58,728
>> WE HEARD YESTERDAY FROM AN

04:32:58,728 --> 04:32:59,295
EXTRAORDINARILY COURAGEOUS, 

692
04:32:59,295 --> 04:32:59,929
STRONG, SURVIVOR DR. CHRISTINE 

693
04:32:59,929 --> 04:33:00,262
BLASEY FORD. 

694
04:33:00,262 --> 04:33:00,930
EVERY ONE OF US, I THINK, WERE 

695
04:33:00,930 --> 04:33:01,430
RIVETED AND POWERFULLY 

696
04:33:01,430 --> 04:33:01,964
IMPRESSED BY HER TRUTH. 

697
04:33:01,964 --> 04:33:02,631
WE HEARD HER PROVIDE DETAILS IN 

698
04:33:02,631 --> 04:33:03,165
THAT STORY THAT CAN BE 

699
04:33:03,165 --> 04:33:03,766
CORROBORATED AND OTHER FACTS 

700
04:33:03,766 --> 04:33:04,300
THAT CAN BE UNCOVERED. 

701
04:33:04,300 --> 04:33:04,967
IF WE HEAR FROM OTHER WITNESSES 

702
04:33:04,967 --> 04:33:05,568
WHO HAVE VERY RELEVANT AND 

703
04:33:05,568 --> 04:33:06,202
IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT 

704
04:33:06,202 --> 04:33:06,868
HAPPENED TO HER ON THAT EVENING 

705
04:33:06,868 --> 04:33:07,236
IN THAT ROOM. 

706
04:33:07,236 --> 04:33:07,869
THE THIRD PERSON ALLEGEDLY IN 

707
04:33:07,869 --> 04:33:08,437
THE ROOM WAS MARK JUDGE. 

708
04:33:08,437 --> 04:33:09,071
EVIDENTIALLY HE HAS NEVER BEEN 

709
04:33:09,071 --> 04:33:09,605
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI. 

710
04:33:09,605 --> 04:33:10,272
HE IS NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY 

711
04:33:10,272 --> 04:33:10,905
ANY MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE. 

712
04:33:10,905 --> 04:33:11,439
HE HAS NEVER SUBMITTED A 

713
04:33:11,439 --> 04:33:12,074
DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE 

714
04:33:12,074 --> 04:33:12,675
KNOWS, AND, SO, I MOVE, MR. 

715
04:33:12,675 --> 04:33:13,275
CHAIRMAN, THAT WE HAVE HIM 

716
04:33:13,275 --> 04:33:13,843
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AS A 

717
04:33:13,843 --> 04:33:14,110
WITNESS. 

718
04:33:14,110 --> 04:33:14,776
HE COULD BE INTERVIEWED BEFORE 

719
04:33:14,776 --> 04:33:15,378
HAND ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. 

720
04:33:15,378 --> 04:33:15,911
I RECOGNIZE THAT HE HAS 

721
04:33:15,911 --> 04:33:16,511
SUBMITTED A CURRENT CURSORY, 

722
04:33:16,511 --> 04:33:17,179
CONCLUSORY SIX SENTENCE LETTER, 

723
04:33:17,179 --> 04:33:17,880
NOT EVEN SIGNED BY HIM BUT FROM 

724
04:33:17,880 --> 04:33:18,514
HIS ATTORNEY AND I BELIEVE WE 

725
04:33:18,514 --> 04:33:19,080
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO 

726
04:33:19,080 --> 04:33:19,715
SUBPOENA, AT THE VERY LEAST, 

727
04:33:19,715 --> 04:33:20,383
MARK JUDGE, BEFORE WE MOVED TO

04:33:20,383 --> 04:33:20,582
VOTE. 

729
04:33:20,582 --> 04:33:21,250
IT IS OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY 

730
04:33:21,250 --> 04:33:21,850
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO 

731
04:33:21,850 --> 04:33:22,485

ANXIETY.

AS A RESULT, I AVOID PUBLIC

YESTERDAY WE HEARD TESTIMONY 

852
04:34:29,185 --> 04:34:29,851
FROM DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 

853
04:34:29,851 --> 04:34:30,453
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH REGARDING 

854
04:34:30,453 --> 04:34:31,119
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS THAT 

855
04:34:31,119 --> 04:34:31,821
DATE BACK TO WHEN THE TWO WERE 

856
04:34:31,821 --> 04:34:32,187
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

857
04:34:32,187 --> 04:34:32,822
IT WAS DIFFICULT AND EMOTIONAL 

858
04:34:32,822 --> 04:34:33,255
FOR BOTH OF THEM. 

859
04:34:33,255 --> 04:34:33,856
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 

860
04:34:33,856 --> 04:34:34,490
THREE WITNESSES DR. FORD NAMED 

861
04:34:34,490 --> 04:34:35,091
DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE 

862
04:34:35,091 --> 04:34:35,558
EVENT SHE DESCRIBED. 

863
04:34:35,558 --> 04:34:36,125
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FORCEFULLY 

864
04:34:36,125 --> 04:34:36,659
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS. 

865
04:34:36,659 --> 04:34:37,193
THE ALLEGED BEHAVIOR IS 

866
04:34:37,193 --> 04:34:37,827
INCONSISTENT WITH EVERYTHING 

867
04:34:37,827 --> 04:34:38,360
ELSE WE KNOW ABOUT HIM. 

868
04:34:38,360 --> 04:34:38,993
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING 

869
04:34:38,993 --> 04:34:39,662
WOMEN HE KNEW IN HIGH SCHOOL 

870
04:34:39,662 --> 04:34:40,261
ATTESTED TO HIS CHARACTER AND 

871
04:34:40,261 --> 04:34:40,930
FUNDAMENTAL DECENCY AS A PERSON 

872
04:34:40,930 --> 04:34:41,563
BOTH IN HIGH SCHOOL AND NOW. 

873
04:34:41,563 --> 04:34:42,231
HE IS WIDELY REGARDED AS AN 

874
04:34:42,231 --> 04:34:42,797
EXCELLENT HUSBAND, FATHER, 

875
04:34:42,797 --> 04:34:43,466
FRIEND, COACH, PROFESSOR, JUDGE 

876
04:34:43,466 --> 04:34:44,099
AND IS AN EXEMPLARY RECORD OF 

877
04:34:44,099 --> 04:34:44,667
BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF 

878
04:34:44,667 --> 04:34:45,234
WOMEN'S ADVANCEMENT IN THE 

879
04:34:45,234 --> 04:34:45,633
LEGAL PROFESSION. 

880
04:34:45,633 --> 04:34:46,235
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH SIX FBI 

881
04:34:46,235 --> 04:34:46,702
FULL-TIME BACKGROUND 

882
04:34:46,702 --> 04:34:47,402
INVESTIGATIONS AND NO ISSUES OF 

883
04:34:47,402 --> 04:34:47,902
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WERE 

884
04:34:47,902 --> 04:34:48,204
UNCOVERED. 

885
04:34:48,204 --> 04:34:48,838
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF 

886
04:34:48,838 --> 04:34:49,472
FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS THAT 

887
04:34:49,472 --> 04:34:50,139
THE ACCUSER HAVE THE BURDEN OF 

888
04:34:50,139 --> 04:34:50,606
PROVING ALLEGATIONS. 

889
04:34:50,606 --> 04:34:51,172
IT'S TRUE YESTERDAY -- 

890
04:34:51,172 --> 04:34:51,774
YESTERDAY'S HEARING WAS NOT A 

891
04:34:51,774 --> 04:34:52,374
TRIAL BUT TRIALS HAVE RULES 

892
04:34:52,374 --> 04:34:53,042
BASED ON COMMONSENSE NOTIONS OF 

893
04:34:53,042 --> 04:34:53,609
FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS. 

894
04:34:53,609 --> 04:34:54,143
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. 

895
04:34:54,143 --> 04:34:54,776
A PERSON HAD ALLEGATIONS MADE 

896
04:34:54,776 --> 04:34:55,444
AGAINST HIM IN A PUBLIC WAY AND 

897
04:34:55,444 --> 04:34:56,078
HIS REPUTATION AND LIVELIHOOD 

898
04:34:56,078 --> 04:34:56,445
WERE AT STAKE. 

899
04:34:56,445 --> 04:34:57,045
IT WAS ONLY FAIR THAT HIS 

900
04:34:57,045 --> 04:34:57,613
ACCUSER HAD THE BURDEN OF 

901
04:34:57,613 --> 04:34:57,847
PROOF.  

902
04:34:57,847 --> 04:34:58,447
IN MY OPINION, THIS WASN'T 

903
04:34:58,447 --> 04:34:58,681
MEANT. 

904
04:34:58,681 --> 04:34:59,115
YOU FOLKS THAT ARE 

905
04:34:59,115 --> 04:34:59,782
PHOTOGRAPHERS KNOW THAT YOU ARE 

906
04:34:59,782 --> 04:35:00,249
SUPPOSED TO SIT DOWN. 

907
04:35:00,249 --> 04:35:00,883
MAYBE YOU JUST WANT TO LEAVE 

908
04:35:00,883 --> 04:35:01,583
THE ROOM IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT 

909
04:35:01,583 --> 04:35:01,984
THE RULES ARE.  

910
04:35:01,984 --> 04:35:02,651
I DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY CREDIBLE 

911
04:35:02,651 --> 04:35:03,285
AND BELIEVE SHE IS SINCERE IN 

912
04:35:03,285 --> 04:35:03,953
HER VERSION OF THE FACTS BUT HE 

913
04:35:03,953 --> 04:35:04,553
ALSO FOUND JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

914
04:35:04,553 --> 04:35:05,221
TESTIMONY CREDIBLE AND SINCERE, 

915
04:35:05,221 --> 04:35:05,754
ULTIMATELY THE EXISTING 

916
04:35:05,754 --> 04:35:06,255
EVIDENCE INCLUDING THE 

917
04:35:06,255 --> 04:35:06,822
STATEMENT OF THREE ALLEGED 

918
04:35:06,822 --> 04:35:07,490
EYEWITNESSES NAMED BY DR. FORD 

919
04:35:07,490 --> 04:35:08,124
REFUTES DR. FORD'S VERSION OF 

920
04:35:08,124 --> 04:35:08,424
THE FACTS. 

921
04:35:08,424 --> 04:35:09,091
THERE IS SIMPLY NO REASON TO 

922
04:35:09,091 --> 04:35:09,758
DENY JUDGE KAVANAUGH A SEAT ON 

923
04:35:09,758 --> 04:35:10,392
THE SUPREME COURT ON THE BASIS 

924
04:35:10,392 --> 04:35:10,992
OF EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO US. 

925
04:35:10,992 --> 04:35:11,594
I REOPEN THE HEARING AT THE 

926
04:35:11,594 --> 04:35:12,194
ASSISTANCE OF DR. FORD AND 

927
04:35:12,194 --> 04:35:12,595
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

928
04:35:12,595 --> 04:35:13,229
DR. FORD WANTED TO BE HEARD, 

929
04:35:13,229 --> 04:35:13,729
AND WE GAVE HER THAT 

930
04:35:13,729 --> 04:35:14,062
OPPORTUNITY. 

931
04:35:14,062 --> 04:35:14,697
NOT ONE QUESTION TO DR. FORD 

932
04:35:14,697 --> 04:35:15,330
WAS DISRESPECTFUL IN ANY WAY. 

933
04:35:15,330 --> 04:35:15,965
SHE WAS TREATED WITH COURTESY 

934
04:35:15,965 --> 04:35:16,598
AND DIGNITY AS I PROMISED HER 

935
04:35:16,598 --> 04:35:17,233
BUT THE QUESTIONS MY DEMOCRAT 

936
04:35:17,233 --> 04:35:17,733
COLLEAGUES ASKED JUDGE 

937
04:35:17,733 --> 04:35:18,333
KAVANAUGH WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY 

938
04:35:18,333 --> 04:35:18,867
AND UNIVERSALLY HOSTILE. 

939
04:35:18,867 --> 04:35:19,502
MY COLLEAGUES FIRST CLAIMED THE 

940
04:35:19,502 --> 04:35:20,135
SENATE DOESN'T CONFIRM SUPREME 

941
04:35:20,135 --> 04:35:20,703
COURT NOMINEES IN MIDTERM 

942
04:35:20,703 --> 04:35:21,003
ELECTIONS. 

943
04:35:21,003 --> 04:35:21,604
THE WASHINGTON POST/CHECKER 

944
04:35:21,604 --> 04:35:22,037
SAID THAT'S FALSE. 

945
04:35:22,037 --> 04:35:22,471
INDEED JUSTICE -- 

946
04:35:22,471 --> 04:35:23,105
>> CAN WE HAVE QUIET, PLEASE. 

947
04:35:23,105 --> 04:35:23,739
I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME QUIET 

948
04:35:23,739 --> 04:35:24,306
FROM OTHER PEOPLE ON THE 

949
04:35:24,306 --> 04:35:24,874
COMMITTEE WHEN THEY SPEAK. 

950
04:35:24,874 --> 04:35:25,508
>> INDEED JUSTICE CATERER AND 

951
04:35:25,508 --> 04:35:26,108
BRYAN WERE CONFIRMED AND THE 

952
04:35:26,108 --> 04:35:26,775
ATTEMPT WAS TO ARGUE WE NEEDED 

953
04:35:26,775 --> 04:35:27,242
TO REQUEST ALL JUDGE 

954
04:35:27,242 --> 04:35:27,843
KAVANAUGH'S EXECUTIVE BRANCH 

955
04:35:27,843 --> 04:35:28,110
RECORDS. 

956
04:35:28,110 --> 04:35:28,811
THEY COMPLETELY IGNORE THE FACT 

957
04:35:28,811 --> 04:35:29,478
THAT WE DID NOT REQUEST ALL OF 

958
04:35:29,478 --> 04:35:30,011
JUSTICE KAGAN'S EXECUTIVE 

959
04:35:30,011 --> 04:35:30,379
BRANCH RECORDS. 

960
04:35:30,379 --> 04:35:31,012
HER MOST RECENT AND RELEVANT 

961
04:35:31,012 --> 04:35:31,647
EXECUTIVE BRANCH RECORDS FROM 

962
04:35:31,647 --> 04:35:32,280
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL'S OFFICE 

963
04:35:32,280 --> 04:35:32,748
WERE NOT REQUESTED. 

964
04:35:32,748 --> 04:35:33,348
EVEN DESPITE THE FACT THAT 

965
04:35:33,348 --> 04:35:33,949
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS SPENT THE 

966
04:35:33,949 --> 04:35:34,550
LAST 12 YEARS ON THE SECOND 

967
04:35:34,550 --> 04:35:35,151
MOST -- EVEN THOUGH JUDGE 

968
04:35:35,151 --> 04:35:35,818
KAVANAUGH HAS SPENT THE LAST 12 

969
04:35:35,818 --> 04:35:36,384
YEARS ON THE SECOND MOST 

970
04:35:36,384 --> 04:35:37,019
POWERFUL COURT IN THE COUNTRY 

971
04:35:37,019 --> 04:35:37,553
ISSUING 307 OPINIONS AND 

972
04:35:37,553 --> 04:35:38,220
JOINING HUNDREDS OF OTHERS, WE 

973
04:35:38,220 --> 04:35:38,854
RECEIVED OVER 480,000 PAGES OF 

974
04:35:38,854 --> 04:35:39,321
DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE 

975
04:35:39,321 --> 04:35:39,855
KAVANAUGH'S TIME ON THE 

976
04:35:39,855 --> 04:35:40,256
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 

977
04:35:40,256 --> 04:35:40,856
THIS WAS MORE PAGES OF SUCH 

978
04:35:40,856 --> 04:35:41,456
DOCUMENT THAN THE LAST FIVE 

979
04:35:41,456 --> 04:35:41,956
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES 

980
04:35:41,956 --> 04:35:42,223
COMBINED. 

981
04:35:42,223 --> 04:35:42,825
IN SHORT, IT WAS THE MOST 

982
04:35:42,825 --> 04:35:43,359
THOROUGH AND TRANSPARENT 

983
04:35:43,359 --> 04:35:43,859
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 

984
04:35:43,859 --> 04:35:44,560
I'M GOING TO PUT THE REST OF MY 

985
04:35:44,560 --> 04:35:45,226
STATEMENT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE 

986
04:35:45,226 --> 04:35:45,861
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 

987
04:35:45,861 --> 04:35:46,494
IRRITATED RIGHT NOW AND I WILL 

988
04:35:46,494 --> 04:35:46,996
LET THEM EXPRESS THAT 

989
04:35:46,996 --> 04:35:47,295
IRRITATION. 

990
04:35:47,295 --> 04:35:47,897
WE WILL GO BY SENIORITY. 

991
04:35:47,897 --> 04:35:48,530
SENATOR FEINSTEIN. I WILL PUT 

992
04:35:48,530 --> 04:35:49,198
THE REST OF MY STATEMENT IN THE 

993
04:35:49,198 --> 04:35:49,431
RECORD. 

994
04:35:49,431 --> 04:35:50,098
>> I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT 

995
04:35:50,098 --> 04:35:50,733
WE ARE HERE TODAY VOTING ON 

996
04:35:50,733 --> 04:35:51,133
THIS NOMINATION. 

997
04:35:51,133 --> 04:35:51,700
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE 

998
04:35:51,700 --> 04:35:52,234
TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD 

999
04:35:52,234 --> 04:35:52,535
YESTERDAY. 

1000
04:35:52,535 --> 04:35:53,202
MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SPENT 

1001
04:35:53,202 --> 04:35:53,769
THEIR TIME AT THE HEARING 

1002
04:35:53,769 --> 04:35:54,402
FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON POLICY 

1003
04:35:54,402 --> 04:35:55,037
AND PARTISANSHIP AND PROCESS. 

1004
04:35:55,037 --> 04:35:55,704
THE MAJORITY ARGUED THE SEXUAL 

1005
04:35:55,704 --> 04:35:56,305
ASSAULT DR. FORD EXPERIENCED 

1006
04:35:56,305 --> 04:35:56,839
WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A 

1007
04:35:56,839 --> 04:35:57,506
DEMOCRATIC SMEAR CAMPAIGN AND I 

1008
04:35:57,506 --> 04:35:58,107
AM ALLEGEDLY ORCHESTRATING. 

1009
04:35:58,107 --> 04:35:58,774
MY STAFF AND I WERE ACCUSED OF 

1010
04:35:58,774 --> 04:35:59,408
LEAKING DR. FORD LETTER, WHICH 

1011
04:35:59,408 --> 04:35:59,741
WE DID NOT. 

1012
04:35:59,741 --> 04:36:00,342
WE WERE ACCUSED OF LEAKING 

1013
04:36:00,342 --> 04:36:00,975
DEBORAH RAMIREZ'S LETTER WHICH 

1014
04:36:00,975 --> 04:36:01,310
WE DID NOT. 

1015
04:36:01,310 --> 04:36:02,010
WE WERE SAID TO HAVE REFUSED TO 

1016
04:36:02,010 --> 04:36:02,611
PARTICIPATE IN THE PARTISAN, 

1017
04:36:02,611 --> 04:36:03,112
QUOTE, INVESTIGATION. 

1018
04:36:03,112 --> 04:36:03,746
YET IT IS THE REPUBLICANS WHO 

1019
04:36:03,746 --> 04:36:04,446
HAVE REFUSED TO TALK TO DEBBIE 

1020
04:36:04,446 --> 04:36:05,014
RAMIREZ OR JULIE SWETNICK. 

1021
04:36:05,014 --> 04:36:05,580
REPUBLICANS ALSO FAILED TO 

1022
04:36:05,580 --> 04:36:06,148
MENTION DEMOCRATS WERE NOT 

1023
04:36:06,148 --> 04:36:06,814
NOTIFIED AND HAD NO IDEA THAT 

1024
04:36:06,814 --> 04:36:07,315
CHAIRMAN STEPH HAD THE 

1025
04:36:07,315 --> 04:36:07,983
COMMUNICATING WITH MARK JUDGE 

1026
04:36:07,983 --> 04:36:08,583
PATRICK SMITH LEAVING KAISER 

1027
04:36:08,583 --> 04:36:09,185
AND APPARENTLY AT LEAST TWO 

1028
04:36:09,185 --> 04:36:09,818
OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT 

1029
04:36:09,818 --> 04:36:10,151
BEEN NAMED. 

1030
04:36:10,151 --> 04:36:10,786
THEY LEARNED ABOUT THIS WHEN 

1031
04:36:10,786 --> 04:36:11,353
VARIOUS LETTERS OR EMAILS 

1032
04:36:11,353 --> 04:36:11,987
APPEARED AND IN ONE CASE, WE 

1033
04:36:11,987 --> 04:36:12,588
LEARNED ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN 

1034
04:36:12,588 --> 04:36:13,222
STAFF OUTREACH AT 10 PM THE 

1035
04:36:13,222 --> 04:36:13,789
NIGHT BEFORE THE HEARING. 

1036
04:36:13,789 --> 04:36:14,422
IRONICALLY, MY COLLEAGUES ON 

1037
04:36:14,422 --> 04:36:15,090
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HAD 

1038
04:36:15,090 --> 04:36:15,723
GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY THIS 

1039
04:36:15,723 --> 04:36:16,292
WHOLE SITUATION WAS NOTHING 

1040
04:36:16,292 --> 04:36:16,926
MORE THAN A NEFARIOUS ATTEMPT 

1041
04:36:16,926 --> 04:36:17,426
AT POLITICAL THEATER. 

1042
04:36:17,426 --> 04:36:18,093
I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID THAT. 

1043
04:36:18,093 --> 04:36:18,760
THE SENATE IS A POLITICAL BODY. 

1044
04:36:18,760 --> 04:36:19,328
I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE JUDGE 

1045
04:36:19,328 --> 04:36:19,962
KAVANAUGH TAKE THE SAME TONE 

1046
04:36:19,962 --> 04:36:20,295
AND STRATEGY. 

1047
04:36:20,295 --> 04:36:20,930
CANDIDLY, IN THE 25 YEARS ON 

1048
04:36:20,930 --> 04:36:21,529
THIS COMMITTEE, I HAVE NEVER 

1049
04:36:21,529 --> 04:36:22,198
SEEN A NOMINEE FOR ANY POSITION 

1050
04:36:22,198 --> 04:36:22,698
BEHAVE IN THAT MANNER. 

1051
04:36:22,698 --> 04:36:23,331
JUDGE KAVANAUGH USED AS MUCH 

1052
04:36:23,331 --> 04:36:23,899
POLITICAL RHETORIC AS MY 

1053
04:36:23,899 --> 04:36:24,500
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AND HE 

1054
04:36:24,500 --> 04:36:24,934
WENT ON THE ATTACK. 

1055
04:36:24,934 --> 04:36:25,501
HE YELLED THE DEMOCRATS FOR 

1056
04:36:25,501 --> 04:36:26,168
HAVING THE TEMERITY TO EXPRESS 

1057
04:36:26,168 --> 04:36:26,835
OUR FRUSTRATION, FOR NOT HAVING 

1058
04:36:26,835 --> 04:36:27,402
ACCESS TO OVER 90% OF HIS 

1059
04:36:27,402 --> 04:36:27,635
RECORD. 

1060
04:36:27,635 --> 04:36:28,304
AND SAID THAT SOME DEMOCRATIC 

1061
04:36:28,304 --> 04:36:28,871
MEMBERS WERE, QUOTE, A■ND 

1062
04:36:28,871 --> 04:36:29,338
EMBARRASSMENT -- AN 

1063
04:36:29,338 --> 04:36:29,938
EMBARRASSMENT AND REFUSED -- 

1064
04:36:29,938 --> 04:36:30,573
ACCUSED DEMOCRATS OF LYING IN 

1065
04:36:30,573 --> 04:36:30,773
WAIT. 

1066
04:36:30,773 --> 04:36:31,473
>>> WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE 

1067
04:36:31,473 --> 04:36:32,107
JUDICIAL NOMINATION PROCESS AND 

1068
04:36:32,107 --> 04:36:32,775
EVERY CUSTOM THE SENATE EMBRACE 

1069
04:36:32,775 --> 04:36:33,342
BEFORE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 

1070
04:36:33,342 --> 04:36:33,876
PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED. 

1071
04:36:33,876 --> 04:36:34,577
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL EVER BE 

1072
04:36:34,577 --> 04:36:34,843
REVIVED. 

1073
04:36:34,843 --> 04:36:35,444
SOMEBODY TOOK MRS. FORD'S 

1074
04:36:35,444 --> 04:36:36,145
ANONYMOUS LETTER AND LEAD IT TO 

1075
04:36:36,145 --> 04:36:36,712
THE PRESS NOT GIVING A DAM 

1076
04:36:36,712 --> 04:36:37,379
ABOUT HER TO SLOW THE PURPOSE, 

1077
04:36:37,379 --> 04:36:37,947
DELAY THE VOTE, TRYING TO 

1078
04:36:37,947 --> 04:36:38,514
DESTROY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

1079
04:36:38,514 --> 04:36:39,148
COMPLETELY INDIFFERENT TO THE 

1080
04:36:39,148 --> 04:36:39,715
EFFECT IT HAD ON DR. FORD. 

1081
04:36:39,715 --> 04:36:40,348
WHAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS 

1082
04:36:40,348 --> 04:36:40,749
DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 

1083
04:36:40,749 --> 04:36:41,283
I LIKE DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 

1084
04:36:41,283 --> 04:36:41,883
I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WOULD DO 

1085
04:36:41,883 --> 04:36:42,418
THIS BUT SOMEBODY DID. 

1086
04:36:42,418 --> 04:36:43,117
AND THE THREE GROUPS TO LOOK AT 

1087
04:36:43,117 --> 04:36:43,786
OUR HER STAFF, THE LAWYERS, AND 

1088
04:36:43,786 --> 04:36:44,286
THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM 

1089
04:36:44,286 --> 04:36:44,587
CALIFORNIA. 

1090
04:36:44,587 --> 04:36:45,221
THE DETAILS THAT WERE LEAKED 

1091
04:36:45,221 --> 04:36:45,887
OUT DID NOT COME FROM A FRIEND. 

1092
04:36:45,887 --> 04:36:46,322
THIS WAS PLANNED. 

1093
04:36:46,322 --> 04:36:47,022
THE FOURTH LETTER -- BEFORE THE 

1094
04:36:47,022 --> 04:36:47,323
ACCUSATION. 

1095
04:36:47,323 --> 04:36:47,922
IS ANYBODY HERE FROM NBC? 

1096
04:36:47,922 --> 04:36:48,290
ARE YOU READY? 

1097
04:36:48,290 --> 04:36:48,857
CORY GARDNER RECEIVED AN 

1098
04:36:48,857 --> 04:36:49,425
ANONYMOUS LETTER WITH NO 

1099
04:36:49,425 --> 04:36:50,092
POSTMARK AND HE BROUGHT IT TO 

1100
04:36:50,092 --> 04:36:50,758
THE COMMITTEE SEVERAL DAYS AGO. 

1101
04:36:50,758 --> 04:36:51,393
ABOUT AN ALLEGED INCIDENT IN 

1102
04:36:51,393 --> 04:36:52,026
1998 IN A RESTAURANT WITH NO 

1103
04:36:52,026 --> 04:36:52,661
DETAILS OF WHO IT WAS AND NO 

1104
04:36:52,661 --> 04:36:53,329
POSTMARK BUT HE FELT LIKE HE 

1105
04:36:53,329 --> 04:36:53,829
SHOULD TURN IT OVER.  

1106
04:36:53,829 --> 04:36:54,463
ALL I CAN SAY IS AN ANONYMOUS 

1107
04:36:54,463 --> 04:36:55,164
LETTER -- IF THAT CAN MAKE NEWS 

1108
04:36:55,164 --> 04:36:55,764
AND AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF A 

1109
04:36:55,764 --> 04:36:56,398
COMMITTEE, WHERE REALLY GOING 

1110
04:36:56,398 --> 04:36:56,932
TO DESTROY THE PROCESS. 

1111
04:36:56,932 --> 04:36:57,533
WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT NBC IS 

1112
04:36:57,533 --> 04:36:58,200
THAT YOU RAN WITH IT AND WHAT 

1113
04:36:58,200 --> 04:36:58,901
BOTHERS ME MORE IS SOMEBODY ON 

1114
04:36:58,901 --> 04:36:59,535
THEIR SIDE GAVE IT TO YOU. 

1115
04:36:59,535 --> 04:37:00,202
YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT 

1116
04:37:00,202 --> 04:37:00,803
WITH A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. 

1117
04:37:00,803 --> 04:37:01,402
TO MY FRIENDS AT NBC, DON'T 

1118
04:37:01,402 --> 04:37:02,071
WRITE OFF CONSERVATIVE CONCERNS 

1119
04:37:02,071 --> 04:37:02,605
ABOUT NBC TO ROGER ELSE. 

1120
04:37:02,605 --> 04:37:03,305
YOU NEED TO THINK LONG AND HARD 

1121
04:37:03,305 --> 04:37:03,905
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID ABOUT THE 

1122
04:37:03,905 --> 04:37:04,205
INVITATION. 

1123
04:37:04,205 --> 04:37:04,840
THE CUSTOMS OF THE COMMITTEE, 

1124
04:37:04,840 --> 04:37:05,473
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY BENT OVER 

1125
04:37:05,473 --> 04:37:06,141
BACKWARD TO MAKE SURE DR. FORD 

1126
04:37:06,141 --> 04:37:06,809
COULD BE HEARD AT ANY TIME AND 

1127
04:37:06,809 --> 04:37:07,475
LOCATION OF HER CHOOSING AND I 

1128
04:37:07,475 --> 04:37:08,110
WAS STUNNED TO HEAR FROM DR. 

1129
04:37:08,110 --> 04:37:08,743
FORD THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT 

1130
04:37:08,743 --> 04:37:09,411
WAS AVAILABLE TO HER TO TESTIFY 

1131
04:37:09,411 --> 04:37:09,912
IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE 

1132
04:37:09,912 --> 04:37:10,446
CONDITIONS THAT SHE WOULD 

1133
04:37:10,446 --> 04:37:10,713
REQUEST. 

1134
04:37:10,713 --> 04:37:11,280
I FIND THAT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 

1135
04:37:11,413 --> 04:37:11,847
>> WHY IT ACCEPTED?

1136
04:37:11,847 --> 04:37:12,414
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE

1137
04:37:12,414 --> 04:37:13,047
DEBACLE WE WITNESSED YESTERDAY,

1138
04:37:13,047 --> 04:37:13,682
AND SEEMED SEEMED SO TO MY GOOD

1139
04:37:13,682 --> 04:37:13,916
FRIEND,

1140
04:37:13,916 --> 04:37:14,550
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE

1141
04:37:14,550 --> 04:37:15,116
ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THIS

1142
04:37:15,116 --> 04:37:15,383
COMMITTEE.

1143
04:37:15,383 --> 04:37:16,051
I DON'T TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT

1144
04:37:16,051 --> 04:37:16,518
AN FBI INVESTIGATION.

1145
04:37:16,518 --> 04:37:17,186
IF YOU REALLY WONDERED WHAT THE

1146
04:37:17,186 --> 04:37:17,786
FBI COULD OR SHOULD DO, YOU

1147
04:37:17,786 --> 04:37:18,419
WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD IN A

1148
04:37:18,419 --> 04:37:18,754
TIMELY MANNER.

1149
04:37:18,754 --> 04:37:19,455
THE FBI IS NOT GOING TO TELL US

1150
04:37:19,455 --> 04:37:20,089
ANY MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW.

1151
04:37:20,089 --> 04:37:20,723
AS TO THE ACCUSATIONS, I WENT

1152
04:37:20,723 --> 04:37:21,390
THROUGH ALL FIVE AND I WOULD SAY

1153
04:37:21,390 --> 04:37:21,590
THIS.

1154
04:37:21,590 --> 04:37:22,124
THERE ARE NO STATUTE OF

1155
04:37:22,124 --> 04:37:22,758
LIMITATIONS IN MARYLAND, SO IF

1156
04:37:22,758 --> 04:37:23,392
SOMEBODY WANTED TO GO THROUGH

1157
04:37:23,392 --> 04:37:24,059
THIS CASE, IF YOU COULD FIND OUT

1158
04:37:24,059 --> 04:37:24,693
WHAT TOWN IT HAPPENED AND WHEN

1159
04:37:24,693 --> 04:37:25,327
IT HAPPENED, AND YOU CAN MAKE A

1160
04:37:25,327 --> 04:37:25,828
COMPLAINT AGAINST JUDGE

1161
04:37:25,828 --> 04:37:26,494
KAVANAUGH AND IF THAT COMPLAINT

1162
04:37:26,494 --> 04:37:27,096
IS TAKEN TO A COURT AND HE'S

1163
04:37:27,096 --> 04:37:27,730
CONVICTED, I WILL BE THE FIRST

1164
04:37:27,730 --> 04:37:28,364
ONE TO SAY WE NEED TO LOOK AT

1165
04:37:28,364 --> 04:37:28,998
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I WILL BE IN

1166
04:37:28,998 --> 04:37:29,265
THE NBA.

1167
04:37:29,265 --> 04:37:29,898
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN

1168
04:37:29,898 --> 04:37:30,565
THE LOW -- LOWEST POINT OF THE

1169
04:37:30,565 --> 04:37:31,233
COMMITTEES SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE

1170
04:37:31,233 --> 04:37:31,967
AND IT'S JUST RANK WITH POLITICS

1171
04:37:31,967 --> 04:37:32,634
AND NOBODY REALLY CARE BODY DR.

1172
04:37:32,634 --> 04:37:33,235
FORD AND NOBODY REALLY CARED

1173
04:37:33,235 --> 04:37:33,868
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, AND WHEN

1174
04:37:33,868 --> 04:37:34,570
I HEAR MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES

1175
04:37:34,570 --> 04:37:35,237
OENLY SAY IF WE CAN DELAY THIS

1176
04:37:35,237 --> 04:37:35,903
PAST THE MID-TERMS, WE TAKE BACK

1177
04:37:35,903 --> 04:37:36,538
THE SENATE AND KEEP THIS SEAT

1178
04:37:36,538 --> 04:37:36,805
UNFILLED.

1179
04:37:36,805 --> 04:37:37,139
DISGUSTING.

1180
04:37:37,205 --> 04:37:37,905
>> SO WE JUST HEARD FROM LINDSEY

1181
04:37:37,905 --> 04:37:38,540
GRAHAM OUTSIDE OF THE CHAMBERS

1182
04:37:38,540 --> 04:37:38,741
THERE.

1183
04:37:38,741 --> 04:37:39,375
REITERATING SOMETHING HE SAID

1184
04:37:39,375 --> 04:37:39,974
VERY PASSIONENTLY DURING THE

1185
04:37:39,974 --> 04:37:40,442
HEARING YESTERDAY --

1186
04:37:40,442 --> 04:37:41,043
PASSIONATELY SINCE YESTERDAY,

1187
04:37:41,043 --> 04:37:41,677
BLAMING FOR POLITICIZING THIS

1188
04:37:41,677 --> 04:37:42,277
PROCESS, WONDERING WHO LEAKED

1189
04:37:42,277 --> 04:37:42,978
SOME OF THE LETTER THAT DR. FORD

1190
04:37:42,978 --> 04:37:43,646
WROTE ABOUT THIS ACCUSATION --

1191
04:37:43,646 --> 04:37:44,213
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT MORE

1192
04:37:44,213 --> 04:37:44,613
SENATORS TALKING.

1193
04:37:44,613 --> 04:37:45,247
WE'RE GOING TO DIP BACK IN.

1194
04:37:45,313 --> 04:37:45,848
>> THIS HAS GOT TO STOP.

1195
04:37:45,848 --> 04:37:46,515
I'M NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN

1196
04:37:46,515 --> 04:37:46,982
THIS CHARADE ANYMORE.

1197
04:37:46,982 --> 04:37:47,616
ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES TALKED

1198
04:37:47,616 --> 04:37:48,116
ABOUT THIS IS A SHAM.

1199
04:37:48,116 --> 04:37:48,784
THIS IS A SHAM WHAT'S GOING ON.

1200
04:37:48,784 --> 04:37:49,418
DEMOCRATS ARE NOT BEING HEARD.

1201
04:37:49,418 --> 04:37:50,019
THEY'RE PUSHING THROUGH THIS

1202
04:37:50,019 --> 04:37:50,552
PROCESS AND FRANKLY, THE

1203
04:37:50,552 --> 04:37:51,186
STATEMENTS YESTERDAY WERE ABOUT

1204
04:37:51,186 --> 04:37:51,787
BULLYING FELLOW SENATORS AND

1205
04:37:51,787 --> 04:37:51,987
ABOUT

1206
04:37:51,987 --> 04:37:52,221
BULLIES.

1207
04:37:52,221 --> 04:37:52,920
ALL WE HAVE ASKED FOR, IS THERE

1208
04:37:52,920 --> 04:37:53,455
BE AN FBI INVESTIGATION.

1209
04:37:53,455 --> 04:37:54,123
DR. FORD CAME IN AND SHE POURED

1210
04:37:54,123 --> 04:37:54,490
OUT HER HEART.

1211
04:37:54,490 --> 04:37:55,124
SHE COOPERATED WITH THE PROCESS

1212
04:37:55,124 --> 04:37:55,791
AND GAVE THE PROCESS DIGNITY AND

1213
04:37:55,791 --> 04:37:56,025
RESPECT.

1214
04:37:56,025 --> 04:37:56,692
THE LEAST WE COULD DO IS GIVE

1215
04:37:56,692 --> 04:37:57,326
HER THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT OF

1216
04:37:57,326 --> 04:37:57,860
HAVING A PROCESS THAT HAS

1217
04:37:57,860 --> 04:37:58,160
CREDIBILITY.

1218
04:37:58,160 --> 04:37:58,726
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING

1219
04:37:58,726 --> 04:37:59,361
SOMEBODY ON THE UNITED STATES

1220
04:37:59,361 --> 04:37:59,962
SUPREME COURT FOR A LIFETIME.

1221
04:37:59,962 --> 04:38:00,562
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR DEMOCRACY

1222
04:38:00,562 --> 04:38:01,096
AND THE INTEGRITY OF OUR

1223
04:38:01,096 --> 04:38:01,597
DEMOCRACY, YOU WLD THINK

1224
04:38:01,597 --> 04:38:02,197
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES

1225
04:38:02,197 --> 04:38:02,830
SENATE WOULD SAY WAIT A MINUTE,

1226
04:38:02,830 --> 04:38:03,499
THERE IS ENOUGH TO PUSH PAUSE,

1227
04:38:03,499 --> 04:38:04,098
LET'S REFLECT ON WHAT WE'RE

1228
04:38:04,098 --> 04:38:04,433
ABOUT TO DO.

1229
04:38:04,433 --> 04:38:05,034
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ABOUT

1230
04:38:05,034 --> 04:38:05,734
THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE IN TERMS

1231
04:38:05,734 --> 04:38:06,435
OF A SYSTEM THAT IS ABOUT TO BE

1232
04:38:06,435 --> 04:38:07,036
AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT

1233
04:38:07,036 --> 04:38:07,303
JUSTICE.

1234
04:38:07,368 --> 04:38:07,869
>> I'M HERE TO JOIN MY

1235
04:38:07,869 --> 04:38:08,504
COLLEAGUES IN OBJECTING TO THE

1236
04:38:08,504 --> 04:38:09,071
SHAM PROCESS THAT IS GOING

1237
04:38:09,071 --> 04:38:09,772
FORWARD RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NEXT TO

1238
04:38:09,772 --> 04:38:10,405
US IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

1239
04:38:10,405 --> 04:38:11,040
THIS ADDS TO THE SEQUENCE OF

1240
04:38:11,040 --> 04:38:11,706
SHAM PROCESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN.

1241
04:38:11,706 --> 04:38:12,374
I THINK IT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN

1242
04:38:12,374 --> 04:38:12,940
THE HISTORY OF BACKGROUND

1243
04:38:12,940 --> 04:38:13,474
INVESTIGATIONS FOR NEW AND

1244
04:38:13,474 --> 04:38:14,076
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS TO COME

1245
04:38:14,076 --> 04:38:14,643
FORWARD AND THE BACKGROUND

1246
04:38:14,643 --> 04:38:15,276
INVESTIGATION NOT BE REOPENED.

1247
04:38:15,276 --> 04:38:15,911
ALL THREE CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS

1248
04:38:15,911 --> 04:38:16,578
HAVE RECEIVED 0 INVESTIGATION BY

1249
04:38:16,578 --> 04:38:16,845
THE FBI.

1250
04:38:16,845 --> 04:38:17,278
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

1251
04:38:17,278 --> 04:38:17,946
THE PARTISAN SHIP THAT WAS ON

1252
04:38:17,946 --> 04:38:18,580
DISPLAY IN YESTERDAY'S HEARING

1253
04:38:18,580 --> 04:38:18,947
WAS NOT RIGHT.

1254
04:38:18,947 --> 04:38:19,481
IT WAS NOT RIGHT FROM MY

1255
04:38:19,481 --> 04:38:19,782
COLLEAGUES.

1256
04:38:19,782 --> 04:38:20,382
IT WAS PARTICULARLY NOT RIGHT

1257
04:38:20,382 --> 04:38:20,783
FROM THE NOMINEE.

1258
04:38:20,783 --> 04:38:21,483
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A DISPLAY

1259
04:38:21,483 --> 04:38:21,950
OF VENGEFUL, PARTISAN,

1260
04:38:21,950 --> 04:38:22,583
CONSPIRACY THEORY BEHAVIOR AND

1261
04:38:22,583 --> 04:38:23,285
NOW WE HAVE THIS SHAM PROCESS IN

1262
04:38:23,285 --> 04:38:23,919
THE COMMITTEE WHICH RAISES THE

1263
04:38:23,919 --> 04:38:24,253
QUESTION WHY?

1264
04:38:24,253 --> 04:38:24,953
WHY ARE THEY SO DESPERATE TO GET

1265
04:38:24,953 --> 04:38:25,587
THIS PERSON THE COURT WITHOUT A

1266
04:38:25,587 --> 04:38:26,055
PROPER INVESTIGATION.

1267
04:38:26,055 --> 04:38:26,322
THANKS.

1268
04:38:26,387 --> 04:38:26,989
>> WHAT WE'RE WATCHING IS A

1269
04:38:26,989 --> 04:38:27,256
BETRAYAL.

1270
04:38:27,256 --> 04:38:27,823
IT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A

1271
04:38:27,823 --> 04:38:28,456
BETRAYAL OF THE UNITED STATES

1272
04:38:28,456 --> 04:38:29,058
SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO

1273
04:38:29,058 --> 04:38:29,491
ADVISE AND CONSENT.

1274
04:38:29,491 --> 04:38:30,224
THAT DUTY CAN BE DONE ONLY IF WE

1275
04:38:30,224 --> 04:38:30,893
UNCOVER ALL OF THE FACTS, GOOD

1276
04:38:30,893 --> 04:38:31,427
OR BAD, ABOUT A NOMINEE.

1277
04:38:31,427 --> 04:38:32,061
THERE HAS BEEN NO ADEQUATE FBI

1278
04:38:32,061 --> 04:38:32,728
INVESTIGATION, THERE HAS BEEN NO

1279
04:38:32,728 --> 04:38:33,261
SUFFICIENT FACT FINDING.

1280
04:38:33,261 --> 04:38:33,929
THERE HAS BEEN BARELY A PROCESS

1281
04:38:33,929 --> 04:38:34,529
OF CONSIDERING THE PEOPLE WHO

1282
04:38:34,529 --> 04:38:34,997
OUGHT TO BE HEARD.

1283
04:38:34,997 --> 04:38:35,664
YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM A POWER

1284
04:38:35,664 --> 04:38:36,297
FULLY CREDIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT

1285
04:38:36,297 --> 04:38:36,564
SURVIVOR.

1286
04:38:36,564 --> 04:38:37,232
THIS PROCESS BE TRAYS ALL OF THE

1287
04:38:37,232 --> 04:38:37,832
HOLLOW, HYPOCRITICAL RESPECT

1288
04:38:37,832 --> 04:38:38,467
THAT OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES

1289
04:38:38,467 --> 04:38:39,100
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE

1290
04:38:39,100 --> 04:38:39,268
HER.

1291
04:38:39,268 --> 04:38:39,935
RAMMING THROUGH THIS NOMINATION

1292
04:38:39,935 --> 04:38:40,635
WITHOUT HEARING FROM MARK JUDGE,

1293
04:38:40,635 --> 04:38:41,270
AND OTHER RELEVANT WITNESSES,

1294
04:38:41,270 --> 04:38:41,937
AND WITHOUT ANY INVESTIGATION IS

1295
04:38:41,937 --> 04:38:42,538
A BETRAYAL OF OUR PROMISE TO

1296
04:38:42,538 --> 04:38:43,105
THOSE SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS

1297
04:38:43,105 --> 04:38:43,639
THAT THEY WOULD BE HEARD

1298
04:38:43,639 --> 04:38:44,273
RESPECTIVELY, AND THIS PROCESS

1299
04:38:44,273 --> 04:38:44,672
IS BEING WATCHED.

1300
04:38:44,672 --> 04:38:45,341
ALL OF AMERICA IS WATCHING THE

1301
04:38:45,341 --> 04:38:45,973
UNITED STATES SENATE TODAY AND

1302
04:38:45,973 --> 04:38:46,474
THEY SHOULD BE DEEPLY

1303
04:38:46,474 --> 04:38:47,042
DISAPPOINTED, EMBARRASSED,

1304
04:38:47,042 --> 04:38:47,609
ASHAMED OF SUPPOSEDLY THE

1305
04:38:47,609 --> 04:38:48,242
WORLD'S GREATEST DELIBERATIVE

1306
04:38:48,242 --> 04:38:48,811
BODY SINKING TO A LOW THAT

1307
04:38:48,811 --> 04:38:49,478
DENIES SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVEYORS,

1308
04:38:49,478 --> 04:38:49,978
THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD.

1309
04:38:49,978 --> 04:38:50,612
THERE ARE TWO THAT SHOULD BE

1310
04:38:50,612 --> 04:38:51,080
CALLED AS WITNESSES.

1311
04:38:51,080 --> 04:38:51,714
THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES LIKE

1312
04:38:51,714 --> 04:38:52,414
MARK JUDGE WHO NEED TO BE CALLED

1313
04:38:52,414 --> 04:38:53,015
ABOUT THIS NOMINEE, AND THERE

1314
04:38:53,015 --> 04:38:53,482
NEEDS TO BE AN FBI

1315
04:38:53,482 --> 04:38:53,815
INVESTIGATION.

1316
04:38:53,815 --> 04:38:54,450
TRAINING PROFESSIONALS, NOT THE

1317
04:38:54,450 --> 04:38:54,950
STAFF OF THE JUDICIARY

1318
04:38:54,950 --> 04:38:55,217
COMMITTEE.

1319
04:38:55,217 --> 04:38:55,818
TRAINED PROFESSIONALS, NOT --

1320
04:38:55,818 --> 04:38:56,485
>> WE'RE TRYING TO COVER ALL THE

1321
04:38:56,485 --> 04:38:56,785
ACTION HERE.

1322
04:38:56,785 --> 04:38:57,453
THERE IS STUFF HAPPENING IN THE

1323
04:38:57,453 --> 04:38:58,087
CHAMBER, IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM

1324
04:38:58,087 --> 04:38:58,721
AND OUTSIDE THIS THE HALLWAY.

1325
04:38:58,721 --> 04:38:59,355
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO DRASTIC

1326
04:38:59,355 --> 04:39:00,022
SENATORS WHO HAVE WALKED OUT OF

1327
04:39:00,022 --> 04:39:00,655
THE COMMITTEE ROOM EXPLAINING

1328
04:39:00,655 --> 04:39:01,290
WHY THEY'VE LEFT AND NOW WE'RE

1329
04:39:01,290 --> 04:39:01,790
GOING TO HEAD BACK IN.

1330
04:39:01,790 --> 04:39:02,458
SENATOR GRASSLEY IS TALKING.

1331
04:39:02,524 --> 04:39:03,025
>> UNLIKE HER DEMOCRAT

1332
04:39:03,025 --> 04:39:03,692
COLLEAGUES, THEY DEDUCTED THEIR

1333
04:39:03,692 --> 04:39:04,258
OWN PRIVATE INVESTIGATION,

1334
04:39:04,258 --> 04:39:04,793
RATHER THAN THE CHAIRMAN.

1335
04:39:04,793 --> 04:39:05,294
I FIRST LEARNED OF HER

1336
04:39:05,294 --> 04:39:05,928
ALLEGATIONS WHEN THEY BECAME

1337
04:39:05,928 --> 04:39:06,462
PUBLISHED "THE NEW YORKER"

1338
04:39:06,462 --> 04:39:07,129
PUBLISHED LATE IN THE EVENING,

1339
04:39:07,129 --> 04:39:07,696
SUNDAY 23rd, AND CONTACT THE

1340
04:39:07,696 --> 04:39:08,296
COUNSEL, ASKING WHEN SHE WAS

1341
04:39:08,296 --> 04:39:08,964
AVAILABLE FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH

1342
04:39:08,964 --> 04:39:09,498
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS.

1343
04:39:09,498 --> 04:39:10,098
THE NEXT AFTERNOON WISH HER

1344
04:39:10,098 --> 04:39:10,699
COUNCIL RESPONDED MS. RAMIREZ

1345
04:39:10,699 --> 04:39:11,300
QUOTE HAS ACCURATELY RELAYED

1346
04:39:11,300 --> 04:39:11,866
WHAT SHE RECALLS TO THE NEW

1347
04:39:11,866 --> 04:39:12,301
YORKER, END QUOTE.

1348
04:39:12,301 --> 04:39:12,867
HE COUNSEL ADDED, QUOTE SHE

1349
04:39:12,867 --> 04:39:13,368
WOULD BE WELCOMED AN

1350
04:39:13,368 --> 04:39:14,002
INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI INTO

1351
04:39:14,002 --> 04:39:14,570
THIS INVESTIGATION AND WOULD

1352
04:39:14,570 --> 04:39:15,037
COOPERATE WITH SUCH.

1353
04:39:15,037 --> 04:39:15,636
ON APPROPRIATE TERMS SHE WOULD

1354
04:39:15,636 --> 04:39:16,305
ALSO AGREE TO BE INTERVIEWED IN

1355
04:39:16,305 --> 04:39:16,739
PERSON, END QUOTE.

1356
04:39:16,739 --> 04:39:17,373
OVER THE 24th AND THE 25th, OF

1357
04:39:17,373 --> 04:39:18,040
THIS MONTH, MY STAFF REPEATEDLY

1358
04:39:18,040 --> 04:39:18,640
ASKED MS. RAMIREZ COUNSEL TWO

1359
04:39:18,640 --> 04:39:19,274
QUESTIONS BEFORE SETTING UP A

1360
04:39:19,274 --> 04:39:19,908
CALL TO DISCUSS HER ALLEGATIONS

1361
04:39:19,908 --> 04:39:20,475
SO THAT SUCH A CALL COULD

1362
04:39:20,475 --> 04:39:21,043
ACTUALLY BE MEANINGFUL AND

1363
04:39:21,043 --> 04:39:21,276
USEFUL.

1364
04:39:21,276 --> 04:39:21,910
NUMBER ONE WHETHER SHE HAD QUOTE

1365
04:39:21,910 --> 04:39:22,510
ANY OTHER EVIDENCE INCLUDING

1366
04:39:22,510 --> 04:39:23,145
OTHER STATEMENTS IN ADDITION TO

1367
04:39:23,145 --> 04:39:23,812
THOSE THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE

1368
04:39:23,812 --> 04:39:24,512
NEW YORKER ARTICLE END OF QUOTE,

1369
04:39:24,512 --> 04:39:25,114
AND TWO WHETHER SHE WAS QUOTE

1370
04:39:25,114 --> 04:39:25,748
WILLING TO PROVIDE HER EVIDENCE

1371
04:39:25,748 --> 04:39:26,314
INCLUDING HER TESTIMONY TO

1372
04:39:26,314 --> 04:39:26,982
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS, END OF

1373
04:39:26,982 --> 04:39:27,182
QUOTE.

1374
04:39:27,182 --> 04:39:27,815
MY STAFF REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR

1375
04:39:27,815 --> 04:39:28,450
THAT IT WELCOMED QUOTE RECEIPT

1376
04:39:28,450 --> 04:39:29,117
OF MS. RAMIREZ'S IN THE FORM OF

1377
04:39:29,117 --> 04:39:29,718
LETTER OR CHAIRMAN OR RANKING

1378
04:39:29,718 --> 04:39:30,351
MEMBER A LETTER FROM OR E-MAIL

1379
04:39:30,351 --> 04:39:31,019
FROM COUNSEL TO THE CHAIRMAN OR

04:39:31,019 --> 04:39:31,720
RANKING MEMBER OR A STATEMENT TO

1381
04:39:31,720 --> 04:39:32,254
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS.

1382
04:39:32,254 --> 04:39:32,855
MS. RAMIREZ COUNSEL HAS STILL

1383
04:39:32,855 --> 04:39:33,455
NOT PROVIDED ANY EVIDENCE TO

1384
04:39:33,455 --> 04:39:33,856
COMMITTEE STAFF.

1385
04:39:33,856 --> 04:39:34,556
IF EVIDENCE EMERGED WE OF COURSE

1386
04:39:34,556 --> 04:39:35,189
WOULD PROCEED AS APPROPRIATE.

1387
04:39:35,189 --> 04:39:35,824
MY STAFF ALSO ACTED SWIFTLY TO

1388
04:39:35,824 --> 04:39:36,491
SET UP AN INTERVIEW WITH JUDGE

1389
04:39:36,491 --> 04:39:36,758
KAVANAUGH.

1390
04:39:36,758 --> 04:39:37,326
HE UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED MS.

1391
04:39:37,326 --> 04:39:37,826
RAMIREZ'S ALLEGATIONS.

1392
04:39:37,826 --> 04:39:38,527
I REGRET MY DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES

1393
04:39:38,527 --> 04:39:39,194
AGAINST FAILED TO TIMELY BRING

1394
04:39:39,194 --> 04:39:39,862
THIS RELEVANT INFORMATION TO HIS

1395
04:39:39,862 --> 04:39:40,162
ATTENTION.

1396
04:39:40,229 --> 04:39:40,562
>> ALL RIGHT.

1397
04:39:40,562 --> 04:39:41,130
BACK OUT INTO THE HALLWAY,

1398
04:39:41,130 --> 04:39:41,730
LISTENING TO THE DEMOCRATIC

1399
04:39:41,730 --> 04:39:42,398
SENATORS OUTSIDE TALKING, HERE'S

1400
04:39:42,398 --> 04:39:42,731
MS. HARRIS.

1401
04:39:42,798 --> 04:39:43,365
>> THEY'VE BEEN PUSHING AND

1402
04:39:43,365 --> 04:39:43,899
RAMMING THIS THING THROUGH

1403
04:39:43,899 --> 04:39:44,533
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE OUR AS

1404
04:39:44,533 --> 04:39:45,100
OPPOSED TO POT SBEG ITY THE

1405
04:39:45,100 --> 04:39:45,367
INTEGRITY.

1406
04:39:45,367 --> 04:39:45,768
HAVE TRANSPARENCY.

1407
04:39:45,768 --> 04:39:46,435
THIS IS A FAILURE OF THIS BODY

1408
04:39:46,435 --> 04:39:47,102
TO DO WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS SAID

1409
04:39:47,102 --> 04:39:47,669
IT'S ABOUT, WHICH IS ABOUT

1410
04:39:47,669 --> 04:39:48,036
DELIBERATIVE.

1411
04:39:48,103 --> 04:39:48,704
>> HOW MUCH COORDINATION AND

1412
04:39:48,704 --> 04:39:49,371
DISCUSSION YOU-ALL DO IN ADVANCE

1413
04:39:49,371 --> 04:39:49,972
OF YESTERDAY'S HEARING AND WHY

1414
04:39:49,972 --> 04:39:50,606
WAS THERE SO MUCH FOCUS ON THE

1415
04:39:50,606 --> 04:39:51,240
FBI INVESTIGATION RATHER THAN

1416
04:39:51,240 --> 04:39:51,840
THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS PAST?

1417
04:39:51,907 --> 04:39:52,441
>> YOU DON'T THINK AN FBI

1418
04:39:52,441 --> 04:39:53,142
INVESTIGATION IS AT THE CORE OF

1419
04:39:53,142 --> 04:39:53,475
ALL OF THIS?

1420
04:39:53,475 --> 04:39:54,176
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN SAYING IF NOT

1421
04:39:54,176 --> 04:39:54,376
THIS?

1422
04:39:54,376 --> 04:39:54,977
WE DO NOT COORDINATE WALKING

1423
04:39:54,977 --> 04:39:55,144
OUT.

1424
04:39:55,144 --> 04:39:55,811
WE FEEL THIS IN HERE, OKAY, AND

1425
04:39:55,811 --> 04:39:56,412
THAT'S WHY ALL THE PEOPLE ARE

1426
04:39:56,412 --> 04:39:56,979
GOING TO SAY QUESTIONING.

1427
04:39:57,045 --> 04:39:57,646
>> THE LINE OF QUESTIONING AT

1428
04:39:57,646 --> 04:39:58,213
YESTERDAY'S HEARING DID YOU

1429
04:39:58,213 --> 04:39:58,847
DISCUSS THE QUESTIONS YOU WOULD

1430
04:39:58,847 --> 04:39:59,348
ASK JUDGE KAVANAUGH?

1431
04:39:59,415 --> 04:40:00,015
>> WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?

1432
04:40:00,082 --> 04:40:00,749
>> WE'VE BEEN CALLING FOR AN FBI

1433
04:40:00,749 --> 04:40:01,417
INVESTIGATION FOR THE FIRST TIME

1434
04:40:01,417 --> 04:40:02,017
WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS LETTER

1435
04:40:02,017 --> 04:40:02,484
FROM DR. BLASEY FORD.

1436
04:40:02,484 --> 04:40:03,018
WE HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR

1437
04:40:03,018 --> 04:40:03,519
HEARINGS AND ADDITIONAL

1438
04:40:03,519 --> 04:40:04,019
WITNESSES FROM DAY ONE.

1439
04:40:04,019 --> 04:40:04,653
THERE IS NOTHING NOVEL AND THERE

1440
04:40:04,653 --> 04:40:05,320
IS NO NEED TO COORDINATE BECAUSE

1441
04:40:05,320 --> 04:40:05,988
THIS POINT IS ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS

1442
04:40:05,988 --> 04:40:06,655
TO EVERY AND IT'S OBVIOUS TO THE

1443
04:40:06,655 --> 04:40:07,322
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE SENATE

1444
04:40:07,322 --> 04:40:07,823
IS RAMMING THROUGH THIS

1445
04:40:07,823 --> 04:40:08,390
NOMINATION, EXAMINING JUDGE

1446
04:40:08,390 --> 04:40:08,991
KAVANAUGH THROUGH THE PROCESS

1447
04:40:08,991 --> 04:40:09,625
WITHOUT KNOWING THE FACTS, BUT

1448
04:40:09,625 --> 04:40:10,292
EVENTUALLY, FACTS WILL COME OUT

1449
04:40:10,292 --> 04:40:10,926
AND THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL

1450
04:40:10,926 --> 04:40:11,493
INVESTIGATIONS AND THE TRUTH

1451
04:40:11,493 --> 04:40:11,794
WILL OUT.

1452
04:40:11,860 --> 04:40:12,561
>> AND YOU HAVE TO BE CLEAR ALSO

1453
04:40:12,561 --> 04:40:13,162
THE SMOKE SCREENS THAT WE'RE

1454
04:40:13,162 --> 04:40:13,395
SEEING.

1455
04:40:13,395 --> 04:40:13,996
SO THEY PUT A PROSECUTOR IN,

1456
04:40:13,996 --> 04:40:14,196
RIGHT?

1457
04:40:14,196 --> 04:40:14,830
THIS -- THE PERSON IN FROM THE

1458
04:40:14,830 --> 04:40:15,497
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN MARICOPA

1459
04:40:15,497 --> 04:40:16,131
COUNTY TO GIVE THE SUGGESTION

1460
04:40:16,131 --> 04:40:16,698
THIS WAS A HEARING THAT WAS

1461
04:40:16,698 --> 04:40:17,366
ABOUT GETTING INTO EVIDENCE AND

1462
04:40:17,366 --> 04:40:17,566
FACTS.

1463
04:40:17,566 --> 04:40:18,200
WELL, SHE SAID HERSELF AND HER

1464
04:40:18,200 --> 04:40:18,834
PROTOCOL SAYS, IT'S VERY CLEAR

1465
04:40:18,834 --> 04:40:19,468
YOU DON'T DO THIS WITHOUT AN

1466
04:40:19,468 --> 04:40:19,802
INVESTIGATION.

1467
04:40:19,802 --> 04:40:20,469
THE FBI IS AN AGENCY OF SWORN,

1468
04:40:20,469 --> 04:40:20,969
TRAINED LAW ENFORCEMENT

1469
04:40:20,969 --> 04:40:21,236
OFFICERS.

1470
04:40:21,236 --> 04:40:21,904
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO AN

1471
04:40:21,904 --> 04:40:22,571
INVESTIGATION, SO UNDERSTAND THE

1472
04:40:22,571 --> 04:40:23,205
MISLEADING SUGGESTION YESTERDAY

1473
04:40:23,205 --> 04:40:23,672
THAT THIS HEARING WAS

1474
04:40:23,672 --> 04:40:23,972
SUFFICIENT.

1475
04:40:23,972 --> 04:40:24,640
IF THIS HEARING WERE SUFFICIENT,

1476
04:40:24,640 --> 04:40:25,240
WE WOULD NOT AS A MATTER OF

1477
04:40:25,240 --> 04:40:25,774
COURSE HAVE THE FBI DO A

1478
04:40:25,774 --> 04:40:26,375
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION EVERY

1479
04:40:26,375 --> 04:40:27,042
TIME WE HAVE A NOMINEE TO THAT

1480
04:40:27,042 --> 04:40:27,709
COURT BUT THEY WANTED TO CUT OFF

1481
04:40:27,709 --> 04:40:28,377
THAT PROCESS AND YOU HAVE TO ASK

1482
04:40:28,377 --> 04:40:28,544
WHY.

1483
04:40:28,544 --> 04:40:29,044
YOU HAVE TO ASK THAT.

1484
04:40:29,111 --> 04:40:29,778
>> YOU SAY THEY HAVE THE POWER.

1485
04:40:29,778 --> 04:40:30,446
PERHAPS WHAT CAN YOU DO NOW?

1486
04:40:30,512 --> 04:40:31,180
>> WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.

1487
04:40:31,246 --> 04:40:31,914
>> WE'RE GOING TO USE EVERY TOOL

1488
04:40:31,914 --> 04:40:32,214
AVAILABLE.

1489
04:40:32,281 --> 04:40:32,614
>> ALL RIGHT.

1490
04:40:32,614 --> 04:40:33,148
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON.

1491
04:40:33,148 --> 04:40:33,749
YOU CAN SEE THE SPLIT SCREEN

1492
04:40:33,749 --> 04:40:33,949
THERE.

1493
04:40:33,949 --> 04:40:34,550
ONE SHOWS INSIDE THE COMMITTEE

1494
04:40:34,550 --> 04:40:35,050
ROOM FOCUSED ON SENATOR

1495
04:40:35,050 --> 04:40:35,317
GRASSLEY.

1496
04:40:35,317 --> 04:40:35,918
OUTSIDE, YOU HAVE A GROUP OF

1497
04:40:35,918 --> 04:40:36,518
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO HAVE

1498
04:40:36,518 --> 04:40:36,785
GATHERED.

1499
04:40:36,785 --> 04:40:37,286
THEY WALKED OUT OF THE

1500
04:40:37,286 --> 04:40:37,920
PROCEEDINGS AND EXPLAINING WHY

1501
04:40:37,920 --> 04:40:38,454
THEY CHOSE TO WALK OUT.

1502
04:40:38,454 --> 04:40:39,188
I WANT TO BRING IN ED O'KEEFE SO

1503
04:40:39,188 --> 04:40:39,755
YOU CAN HELP US SORT OF

1504
04:40:39,755 --> 04:40:40,322
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.

1505
04:40:40,322 --> 04:40:41,023
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WAITING FOR

1506
04:40:41,023 --> 04:40:41,657
A VOTE BUT THERE WAS A MOTION

1507
04:40:41,657 --> 04:40:42,257
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, A MOTION

1508
04:40:42,257 --> 04:40:42,858
FROM SENATOR BLUMENTHAL ABOUT

1509
04:40:42,858 --> 04:40:43,559
SUBPOENAING MARK JUDGE, AND THEN

1510
04:40:43,559 --> 04:40:44,126
AFTER THAT, IT SEEMED LIKE

1511
04:40:44,126 --> 04:40:44,726
THINGS SORT OF WENT OFF THE

1512
04:40:44,726 --> 04:40:44,927
RAILS.

1513
04:40:44,927 --> 04:40:45,561
JUST EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENED SO

1514
04:40:45,561 --> 04:40:46,028
FAR THIS MORNING.

1515
04:40:46,094 --> 04:40:46,762
>> RIGHT, SO WE CONVENED AT 9:30

1516
04:40:46,762 --> 04:40:47,429
AND WE WERE EXPECTING THEM TO

1517
04:40:47,429 --> 04:40:48,096
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF VOTING FOR

1518
04:40:48,096 --> 04:40:48,464
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

1519
04:40:48,464 --> 04:40:49,064
WHAT CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY SAID

1520
04:40:49,064 --> 04:40:49,731
WE'RE VOTING AT 1:30 ON BRETT

1521
04:40:49,731 --> 04:40:49,998
KAVANAUGH.

1522
04:40:49,998 --> 04:40:50,699
IF WE WANT TO SPEND THE NEXT FEW

1523
04:40:50,699 --> 04:40:51,300
HOURS YELLING AND SCREAMING,

1524
04:40:51,300 --> 04:40:51,500
FINE.

1525
04:40:51,500 --> 04:40:52,167
IF WE WANT TO FILE MOTIONS TO

1526
04:40:52,167 --> 04:40:52,801
DELAY THIS EVEN LONGER, OKAY,

1527
04:40:52,801 --> 04:40:53,435
BUT WE'RE HOLDING AN INTERVIEW

1528
04:40:53,435 --> 04:40:53,902
WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH.

1529
04:40:53,902 --> 04:40:54,570
WHAT YOU SAW WAS FOUR DEMOCRATIC

1530
04:40:54,570 --> 04:40:55,237
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE

1531
04:40:55,237 --> 04:40:55,938
GOING TO VOTE NO AND WALK OUT.

1532
04:40:55,938 --> 04:40:56,538
WHEN I ASKED THEM WILL YOUR

1533
04:40:56,538 --> 04:40:57,072
CHAIR BE EMPTY AT 1:30.

1534
04:40:57,072 --> 04:40:57,706
THEY ADMITTED THEY DON'T KNOW.

1535
04:40:57,706 --> 04:40:58,340
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING

1536
04:40:58,340 --> 04:40:58,740
IS MAKING NOISE.

1537
04:40:58,740 --> 04:40:59,308
AT THIS POINT, PROCEDURAL,

1538
04:40:59,308 --> 04:40:59,975
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL DEMOCRATS

1539
04:40:59,975 --> 04:41:00,642
CAN DO IS REPUBLICANS PLAN TO

1540
04:41:00,642 --> 04:41:01,009
HOLD THIS VOTE.

1541
04:41:01,009 --> 04:41:01,677
THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING

1542
04:41:01,677 --> 04:41:02,144
WITH THIS NOMINATION.

1543
04:41:02,144 --> 04:41:02,778
DEMOCRATS, LIBERALS, CRITICS OF

1544
04:41:02,778 --> 04:41:03,412
THE PRESIDENT, CONCERNED ABOUT

1545
04:41:03,412 --> 04:41:04,112
IT, TRYING TO DO WHATEVER THEY

1546
04:41:04,112 --> 04:41:04,847
CAN DO STOP IT AND IT HAS CREDIT

1547
04:41:04,847 --> 04:41:05,481
SEND OWED SINCE THE ALLEGATIONS

1548
04:41:05,481 --> 04:41:05,914
OF BRETT KAVANAUGH.

1549
04:41:05,914 --> 04:41:06,615
ALL OF THESE DEMOCRATS CAN DO IS

1550
04:41:06,615 --> 04:41:07,282
GO TO THE MICROPHONES, ENCOURAGE

1551
04:41:07,282 --> 04:41:07,916
PEOPLE TO CALL AND DELAY THINGS.

1552
04:41:07,916 --> 04:41:08,550
AND REALLY THERE ARE PROTESTERS

1553
04:41:08,550 --> 04:41:09,117
IN THE BUILDING BEHIND US.

1554
04:41:09,117 --> 04:41:09,785
THE POLICE ARE KEEPING US BACK,

1555
04:41:09,785 --> 04:41:10,319
BUT THEY'VE BEEN BLOWING

1556
04:41:10,319 --> 04:41:10,986
WHISTLES AND SAYING THINGS LIKE,

1557
04:41:10,986 --> 04:41:11,653
NOVEMBER IS COMING, NOVEMBER IS

1558
04:41:11,653 --> 04:41:12,187
COMING, WHICH IS TO SAY

1559
04:41:12,187 --> 04:41:12,855
ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND

1560
04:41:12,855 --> 04:41:13,489
PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THIS, AND

1561
04:41:13,489 --> 04:41:14,122
WE'LL SEE NOW THROUGOUT THE DAY

1562
04:41:14,122 --> 04:41:14,756
HOW THAT TRANZ PYRES TRAN PYRES

1563
04:41:14,756 --> 04:41:14,990
AND IF

1564
04:41:14,990 --> 04:41:15,591
ANYTHING -- TRANSPIRES AND IF

1565
04:41:15,591 --> 04:41:15,924
ANYTHING DOES.

1566
04:41:15,924 --> 04:41:16,558
AT THIS POINT WE BELIEVE ONLY

1567
04:41:16,558 --> 04:41:17,226
TWO REPUBLICANS WHO HAVEN'T SAID

1568
04:41:17,226 --> 04:41:17,693
WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO.

1569
04:41:17,693 --> 04:41:18,393
BEYOND THEM YOU HAVE TO KEEP AN

1570
04:41:18,393 --> 04:41:18,927
EYE ON JOE MANSION, JOE

1571
04:41:18,927 --> 04:41:19,528
DONNELLEY, AND HEIDI HEITKAMP.

1572
04:41:19,528 --> 04:41:20,128
HOW DOES THIS WORK FROM A

1573
04:41:20,128 --> 04:41:20,629
POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE?

1574
04:41:20,629 --> 04:41:21,196
HOW THIS NOMINATION BECOMES

1575
04:41:21,196 --> 04:41:21,864
FINAL, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO REALLY

1576
04:41:21,864 --> 04:41:22,498
IS KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE FIVE

1577
04:41:22,498 --> 04:41:22,731
PEOPLE.

1578
04:41:22,731 --> 04:41:23,265
THE REST IS JUST NOISE.

1579
04:41:23,265 --> 04:41:23,832
>> YOU DIDN'T MENTION JEFF

1580
04:41:23,832 --> 04:41:24,032
BLAKE.

1581
04:41:24,032 --> 04:41:24,700
IS HE NO LONGER IN CONTENTION?

1582
04:41:24,766 --> 04:41:25,400
>> HE SAID EARLIER ANNE-MARIE,

1583
04:41:25,400 --> 04:41:26,034
BEFORE THE HEARING BEGAN HE'S A

1584
04:41:26,034 --> 04:41:26,301
YES VOTE.

1585
04:41:26,301 --> 04:41:26,902
HE LAST NIGHT WAS PART OF A

1586
04:41:26,902 --> 04:41:27,436
MEETING WITH COLLINS AND

1587
04:41:27,436 --> 04:41:28,103
MURKOWSKI, HE MADE CLEAR HE WAS

1588
04:41:28,103 --> 04:41:28,737
WITHHOLDING JUDGMENT UNTIL THE

1589
04:41:28,737 --> 04:41:29,304
HEARING WAS OVER AND THIS

1590
04:41:29,304 --> 04:41:29,972
MORNING SAID HE WILL VOTE YES.

1591
04:41:29,972 --> 04:41:30,639
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WITH

1592
04:41:30,639 --> 04:41:31,240
JEFF FLAKE BECAUSE PEOPLE GET

1593
04:41:31,240 --> 04:41:31,773
THIS CONFUSED SOMETIMES.

1594
04:41:31,773 --> 04:41:32,341
HE'S ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S

1595
04:41:32,341 --> 04:41:33,008
BIGGEST CRITICS SO MUCH SO HE

1596
04:41:33,008 --> 04:41:33,509
WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT.

1597
04:41:33,509 --> 04:41:34,142
HE'S NOT GETTING CHRISTMAS CARDS

1598
04:41:34,142 --> 04:41:34,743
FROM THE TRUMP FAMILY ANYMORE

1599
04:41:34,743 --> 04:41:35,377
BUT WHEN YOU ASK HIM IS THERE

1600
04:41:35,377 --> 04:41:35,978
ANYTHING PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES

1601
04:41:35,978 --> 04:41:36,345
THAT HE LIKES?

1602
04:41:36,345 --> 04:41:36,979
HE SAID I LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO

1603
04:41:36,979 --> 04:41:37,646
ARE NOMINEES ON SUPREME COURTS.

1604
04:41:37,646 --> 04:41:38,247
THEY ARE EXACTLY LOOT MEN AND

1605
04:41:38,247 --> 04:41:38,914
WOMEN I WANT TO SEE SERVING ON

1606
04:41:38,914 --> 04:41:39,481
DISTRICT COURTS AND APPEALS

1607
04:41:39,481 --> 04:41:39,715
COURTS.

1608
04:41:39,715 --> 04:41:40,282
LAST YEAR HE WAS OVER THE

1609
04:41:40,282 --> 04:41:40,949
NOMINEE MOON ABOUT NOMINEE NEIL

1610
04:41:40,949 --> 04:41:41,583
GORSUCH AND WAS CONCERNED WHEN

1611
04:41:41,583 --> 04:41:42,184
THESE ALLEGATIONS HAD TO BE

1612
04:41:42,184 --> 04:41:42,818
HANDLED ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION

1613
04:41:42,818 --> 04:41:43,418
OF THE SENATE AND THE WAY IT

1614
04:41:43,418 --> 04:41:43,785
HANDLES THINGS.

1615
04:41:43,785 --> 04:41:44,253
IN HIS VIEW, IT HAS.

1616
04:41:44,253 --> 04:41:44,953
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND HE'S

1617
04:41:44,953 --> 04:41:45,621
NOT POSSIBLY RULED OUT FOR 2020

1618
04:41:45,621 --> 04:41:45,954
AS PRESIDENT.

1619
04:41:45,954 --> 04:41:46,622
IF YOU VOTE AGAINST A GUY WHO IS

1620
04:41:46,622 --> 04:41:47,189
BY ALL MEASURES A JUDICIAL

1621
04:41:47,189 --> 04:41:47,823
CONSERVATIVE, WHO WANT TO BE

1622
04:41:47,823 --> 04:41:48,490
SEEN ON THE COURT SEPARATE FROM

1623
04:41:48,490 --> 04:41:49,124
HIS ALLEGED BEHAVIOR, THEN WHY

1624
04:41:49,124 --> 04:41:49,758
WOULDN'T YOU VOTE FOR SOMEBODY

1625
04:41:49,758 --> 04:41:50,325
LIKE THIS IF YOU'RE STILL

1626
04:41:50,325 --> 04:41:50,926
THINKING ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL

1627
04:41:50,926 --> 04:41:51,193
FUTURE.

1628
04:41:51,260 --> 04:41:51,927
>>IT WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT

1629
04:41:51,927 --> 04:41:52,160
OF TAPE.

1630
04:41:52,160 --> 04:41:52,828
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PROFIT ORS

1631
04:41:52,828 --> 04:41:53,395
DOWN THE HALL AND ABOUT THE

1632
04:41:53,395 --> 04:41:54,062
MESSAGE -- PROTESTORS DOWN THE

1633
04:41:54,062 --> 04:41:54,596
HALL BUILT MESSAGE THEY'RE

1634
04:41:54,596 --> 04:41:55,230
TRYING SEND AND WHO KNOWS WHAT

1635
04:41:55,230 --> 04:41:55,797
FLAKE'S FUTURE PLANS ARE.

1636
04:41:55,797 --> 04:41:56,298
HE WAS ACCOSTED EARLIER.

1637
04:41:56,298 --> 04:41:56,899
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT.

1638
04:41:56,965 --> 04:41:57,666
>> I WANT THE STORY OF MY SEXUAL

1639
04:41:57,666 --> 04:41:57,900
ASSAULT.

1640
04:41:57,900 --> 04:41:58,500
I TOLD THEM I RECOGNIZE SHE'S

1641
04:41:58,500 --> 04:41:58,934
TELLING THE TRUTH.

1642
04:41:58,934 --> 04:41:59,568
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING

1643
04:41:59,568 --> 04:42:00,202
SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY VIOLATED A

1644
04:42:00,202 --> 04:42:00,802
WOMAN TO SIT IN THE SUPREME

1645
04:42:00,802 --> 04:42:01,003
COURT.

1646
04:42:01,003 --> 04:42:01,403
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

1647
04:42:01,403 --> 04:42:02,004
YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR

1648
04:42:02,004 --> 04:42:02,237
FAMILY.

1649
04:42:02,237 --> 04:42:02,638
THINK ABOUT THEM.

1650
04:42:02,638 --> 04:42:03,105
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN.

1651
04:42:03,105 --> 04:42:03,739
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT FOR THE

1652
04:42:03,739 --> 04:42:04,439
NEXT 50 YEARS, THEY WILL HAVE TO

1653
04:42:04,439 --> 04:42:05,007
HAVE SOMEONE IN THE SUPREME

1654
04:42:05,007 --> 04:42:05,641
COURT WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF

1655
04:42:05,641 --> 04:42:06,141
VIOLATING A YOUNG GIRL.

1656
04:42:06,141 --> 04:42:06,675
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR?

1657
04:42:06,742 --> 04:42:07,376
>> I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND

1658
04:42:07,376 --> 04:42:07,809
NOBODY BELIEVES ME.

1659
04:42:07,809 --> 04:42:08,510
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE AND YOU'RE

1660
04:42:08,510 --> 04:42:09,111
TELLING ALL WOMEN THEY DON'T

1661
04:42:09,111 --> 04:42:09,778
MATTER, THEY SHOULD JUST STAY

1662
04:42:09,778 --> 04:42:10,412
QUIET BECAUSE IF THEY TELL YOU

1663
04:42:10,412 --> 04:42:11,013
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM, YOU'RE

1664
04:42:11,013 --> 04:42:11,513
GOING TO IGNORE THEM.

1665
04:42:11,513 --> 04:42:12,180
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND

1666
04:42:12,180 --> 04:42:12,814
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ALL

1667
04:42:12,814 --> 04:42:13,448
WOMEN IN AMERICA, THAT THEY

1668
04:42:13,448 --> 04:42:13,782
DON'T MATTER.

1669
04:42:13,782 --> 04:42:14,416
YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP IT TO

1670
04:42:14,416 --> 04:42:15,083
THEMSELVES BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE

1671
04:42:15,083 --> 04:42:15,684
TOLD THE TRUTH, YOU'RE JUST

1672
04:42:15,684 --> 04:42:16,351
GOING TO HELP THAT MAN TO POWER

1673
04:42:16,351 --> 04:42:16,618
ANY WAY.

1674
04:42:16,618 --> 04:42:17,252
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ALL

1675
04:42:17,252 --> 04:42:17,553
THE WOMEN.

1676
04:42:17,553 --> 04:42:18,186
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME

1677
04:42:18,186 --> 04:42:18,487
RIGHT NOW.

1678
04:42:18,487 --> 04:42:19,121
LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO

1679
04:42:19,121 --> 04:42:19,288
YOU.

1680
04:42:19,288 --> 04:42:19,888
YOU'RE TELLING ME MY ASSAULT

1681
04:42:19,888 --> 04:42:20,255

1682
04:42:20,255 --> 04:42:20,822
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DOESN'T

1683
04:42:20,822 --> 04:42:21,056
MATTER.

1684
04:42:21,056 --> 04:42:21,657
AND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LET

1685
04:42:21,657 --> 04:42:22,324
PEOPLE WHO DO THESE THINGS INTO

1686
04:42:22,324 --> 04:42:22,524
POWER.

1687
04:42:22,524 --> 04:42:23,125
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME

1688
04:42:23,125 --> 04:42:23,625
WHEN YOU VOTE FOR HIM.

1689
04:42:23,625 --> 04:42:24,192
DON'T LOOK AWAY FROM ME.

1690
04:42:24,192 --> 04:42:24,826
LOOK AT ME AND TELL ME THAT

1691
04:42:24,826 --> 04:42:25,527
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO ME, THAT

1692
04:42:25,527 --> 04:42:26,194
YOU'LL LET PEOPLE LIKE THAT COME

1693
04:42:26,194 --> 04:42:26,862
INTO A HIGHEST COURT OF THE LAND

1694
04:42:26,862 --> 04:42:27,563
AND TELL EVERYONE WHAT THEY CAN

1695
04:42:27,563 --> 04:42:27,996
DO TO THEIR BODIES.

1696
04:42:27,996 --> 04:42:28,664
DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER, SENATOR?

1697
04:42:28,730 --> 04:42:29,364
>> DO YOU THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH

1698
04:42:29,364 --> 04:42:29,831
IS TELLING THE TRUTH?

1699
04:42:29,831 --> 04:42:30,499
DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S ABLE TO

1700
04:42:30,499 --> 04:42:31,166
FEEL THE PAIN OF HIS COUNTRY AND

1701
04:42:31,166 --> 04:42:31,433
REPAIR IT?

1702
04:42:31,433 --> 04:42:32,134
THAT IS THE WORK OF JUSTICE, THE

1703
04:42:32,134 --> 04:42:32,768
WAY THAT JUSTICE WORKS IS YOU

1704
04:42:32,768 --> 04:42:33,302
RECOGNIZE HURT, YOU TAKE

1705
04:42:33,302 --> 04:42:33,936
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT, AND THEN

1706
04:42:33,936 --> 04:42:34,469
YOU BEGIN TO REPAIR IT.

1707
04:42:34,469 --> 04:42:35,103
YOU'RE ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO IS

1708
04:42:35,103 --> 04:42:35,804
UNWILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

1709
04:42:35,804 --> 04:42:36,471
FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS AND HARM HE

1710
04:42:36,471 --> 04:42:37,105
DOES TO ONE WOMAN -- ACTUALLY

1711
04:42:37,105 --> 04:42:37,739
THREE WOMEN AND END REPAIR IT.

1712
04:42:37,739 --> 04:42:38,407
YOU ARE ALLOWING SOMEONE WHO IS

1713
04:42:38,407 --> 04:42:39,107
UNWILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

1714
04:42:39,107 --> 04:42:39,741
FOR HIS ACTIONS TO SIT IN THE

1715
04:42:39,741 --> 04:42:40,375
HIGHER COURT OF THE COUNTRY AND

04:42:40,375 --> 04:42:41,043

1717
04:42:41,043 --> 04:42:41,743
HARM THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS

1718
04:42:41,743 --> 04:42:42,244
COUNTRY TO MANY PEOPLE.

1719
04:42:42,244 --> 04:42:42,578
NO THANK YOU.

1720
04:42:42,578 --> 04:42:43,011
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1721
04:42:43,011 --> 04:42:43,545
DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER?

1722
04:42:43,612 --> 04:42:44,246
>> QUESTIONS FOR THE SENATOR?

1723
04:42:44,313 --> 04:42:44,913
>> I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

1724
04:42:44,913 --> 04:42:45,347
DON'T TALK TO ME.

I'M STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF

1727
04:42:46,214 --> 04:42:46,381
YOU.

1728
04:42:46,381 --> 04:42:46,982
DO YOU THINK HE'S TELLING THE

1729
04:42:46,982 --> 04:42:47,182
TRUTH?

1730
04:42:47,182 --> 04:42:47,816
DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S TELLING

1731
04:42:47,816 --> 04:42:48,417
THE TRUTH TO THE COUNTRY?

1732
04:42:48,483 --> 04:42:49,184
>> SO MANY WOMEN ARE POWERLESS.

1733
04:42:49,251 --> 04:42:49,985
>> I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU.

1734
04:42:50,052 --> 04:42:50,619
>> CAN YOU NOT GIVE HIM AN

1735
04:42:50,619 --> 04:42:51,019
ANSWER, SENATOR?

1736
04:42:51,019 --> 04:42:51,553
YOU JUST RELEASED A PRESS

1737
04:42:51,553 --> 04:42:51,820
STATEMENT.

1738
04:42:51,820 --> 04:42:52,454
YOU DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO

1739
04:42:52,454 --> 04:42:52,921
GIVE THEM AN ANSWER?

1740
04:42:52,921 --> 04:42:53,522
THANK YOU IS NOT AN ANSWER,

1741
04:42:53,522 --> 04:42:53,789
SENATOR.

1742

04:42:55,958 --> 04:42:56,558
>> YOU CAN BE A HERO TODAY.

>> YOU COULD BE A HERO AND VOTE

1749
04:42:57,726 --> 04:42:57,893
NO.

1750

WHY NOT WAIT?

1751
04:42:58,226 --> 04:42:58,560
WHY NOT WAIT?

1752
04:42:58,560 --> 04:42:59,027
WHY NOT WAIT FOR THE

1753
04:42:59,027 --> 04:42:59,361
INVESTIGATION?

1754
04:42:59,361 --> 04:42:59,728
THERE'S NO ARM.

1755
04:42:59,728 --> 04:43:00,329
>> HOW YOU CAN BE SPEECHLESS?

1756
04:43:00,329 --> 04:43:00,996
WE DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

1757
04:43:00,996 --> 04:43:01,263

04:43:01,263 --> 04:43:01,797
DO YOU STAND WITH WOMEN?

1759
04:43:01,797 --> 04:43:02,397
DO YOU STAND WITH THIS NATION

SENATOR DO YOU CARE TO RESPOND

>> I NEED TO GO TO THE HEARING.

1766
04:43:06,068 --> 04:43:06,568
I ISSUED A STATEMENT.

04:43:07,202 --> 04:43:07,803
YOU CAN'T GIVE AN ANSWER?

04:43:08,470 --> 04:43:08,737
QUESTIONS.

1771
04:43:08,737 --> 04:43:09,338
DO THESE WOMEN NOT DESERVE AN

04:43:09,338 --> 04:43:09,605
ANSWER?

1773
04:43:09,671 --> 04:43:10,339

STANDING BY, THAT WAS SENATOR

1780
04:43:13,542 --> 04:43:14,176
JEFF FLAKE BEING CONFRONTED BY

1781
04:43:14,176 --> 04:43:14,776
SOME PROTESTORS AND YOU KNOW

1782
04:43:14,776 --> 04:43:15,444
WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS WHEN WE

1783
04:43:15,444 --> 04:43:15,944
FIRST HEART ABOUT BRETT

1784
04:43:15,944 --> 04:43:16,578
KAVANAUGH, THE CONCERN FOR SOME

1785
04:43:16,578 --> 04:43:17,145
PEOPLE WAS IDEALOGICAL, HIS

1786
04:43:17,145 --> 04:43:17,879
POINT OF VIEW ON ROE V. WADE AND

1787
04:43:17,879 --> 04:43:18,547
SUCH THINGS IN RELATIONS TO THE

1788
04:43:18,547 --> 04:43:19,214
ISSUES THAT AFFECT WOMEN AND NOW

1789
04:43:19,214 --> 04:43:19,881
IT'S BECOME VERY PERSONAL, THOSE

1790
04:43:19,881 --> 04:43:20,482
WOMEN WERE TELLING JEFF FLAKE

1791
04:43:20,482 --> 04:43:21,116
THEY WERE ALSO VICTIMS, THAT

1792
04:43:21,116 --> 04:43:21,750
THEY FELT THAT BY SUPPORTING

1793
04:43:21,750 --> 04:43:22,384
BRETT KAVANAUGH THEY WERE --

1794
04:43:22,384 --> 04:43:23,085
THAT HE WAS DISPLAYING A LACK OF

1795
04:43:23,085 --> 04:43:23,585
COMPASSION, A LACK OF

1796
04:43:23,585 --> 04:43:24,252
UNDERSTANDING FOR VICTIMS ACROSS

1797
04:43:24,252 --> 04:43:24,753
THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING

1798
04:43:24,753 --> 04:43:25,053
THEMSELVES.

1799
04:43:25,053 --> 04:43:25,621
SENATOR FLAKE REALLY FOUND

1800
04:43:25,621 --> 04:43:26,188
HIMSELF IN A POSITION WHERE

1801
04:43:26,188 --> 04:43:26,788
THERE WAS NO RIGHT OR WRONG

1802
04:43:26,788 --> 04:43:27,022
ANSWER.

1803
04:43:27,022 --> 04:43:27,623
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY TO

1804
04:43:27,623 --> 04:43:27,990
THESE LADIES.

1805
04:43:28,056 --> 04:43:28,624
>> AND THIS KIND OF DIRECT

1806
04:43:28,624 --> 04:43:29,291
CONFRONTATION IS RARE, BUT THERE

1807
04:43:29,291 --> 04:43:29,958
WAS A SIMILAR EXCHANGE YESTERDAY

1808
04:43:29,958 --> 04:43:30,559
BETWEEN LINDSEY GRAHAM AND A

1809
04:43:30,559 --> 04:43:31,226
WOMAN WHO TOLD THEM SHE HAD BEEN

04:43:31,226 --> 04:43:31,760
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND HE

1811
04:43:31,760 --> 04:43:32,394
BASICALLY TOLD HER IN RESPONSE,

1812
04:43:32,394 --> 04:43:33,061
YOU SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO THE

1813
04:43:33,061 --> 04:43:33,462
POLICE ABOUT THAT.

1814
04:43:33,462 --> 04:43:34,162
BASICALLY SAYING THERE IS REALLY

1815
04:43:34,162 --> 04:43:34,730
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

1816
04:43:34,730 --> 04:43:35,297
THIS PLACE IS TEAMING WITH

1817
04:43:35,297 --> 04:43:35,731
PROTESTORS AND COPS.

1818
04:43:35,731 --> 04:43:36,431
YESTERDAY WE WERE TOLD AT LEAST

OFFICER IS ON DUTY TODAY.

1822
04:43:38,066 --> 04:43:38,667
SOME OF THEM WORKING 16-HOUR

1823
04:43:38,667 --> 04:43:39,301
DAYS TO MAKE SURE THIS PLACE

1824
04:43:39,301 --> 04:43:39,868
REMAINS SOMEWHAT CALM AND

1825
04:43:39,868 --> 04:43:40,102
ORDERLY.

1826
04:43:40,102 --> 04:43:40,702
THEY KEEP DEPLOYING OUT OF A

1827
04:43:40,702 --> 04:43:41,370
BACK ROAD HERE JUST TO THE SIDE

1828
04:43:41,370 --> 04:43:42,004
OF THE HEARING ROOM AND THEY'VE

1829
04:43:42,004 --> 04:43:42,671
BEEN BLOCKING OFF THE ABILITY OF

1830
04:43:42,671 --> 04:43:43,338
PROTESTORS TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR

1831
04:43:43,338 --> 04:43:43,905
THIS HEARING ROOM, CHECKING

1832
04:43:43,905 --> 04:43:44,573
I.D.s AS YOU ROUND EVERY CORNER.

1833
04:43:44,573 --> 04:43:45,173
THAT'S A RARE SIGHT HERE BUT

1834
04:43:45,173 --> 04:43:45,841
SPEAKS TO THE STAKES AND WHAT'S

1835
04:43:45,841 --> 04:43:46,108
GOING ON.

1836
04:43:46,108 --> 04:43:46,575
IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN

1837
04:43:46,575 --> 04:43:47,209
APPOINTMENT, YOU CAN STILL COME

1838
04:43:47,209 --> 04:43:47,376
IN.

1839
04:43:47,376 --> 04:43:48,076
EVERYONE RESPECTS IT AS LONG AS

1840
04:43:48,076 --> 04:43:48,443
YOU'RE ORDERLY.

1841
04:43:48,443 --> 04:43:49,077
THIS KIND OF CON41TATION, RARE

1842
04:43:49,077 --> 04:43:49,711
BUT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE REAL

1843
04:43:49,711 --> 04:43:50,345
PASSION AND CONCERN THAT A LOT

1844
04:43:50,345 --> 04:43:50,912
OF PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT WHAT'S

1845
04:43:50,912 --> 04:43:51,213
GOING ON.

1846
04:43:51,279 --> 04:43:51,880
>> HOW DIFFICULT IS THIS FOR

1847
04:43:51,880 --> 04:43:52,447
THESE -- THESE OLDER MALE

1848
04:43:52,447 --> 04:43:52,714
LAWMAKERS?

1849
04:43:52,714 --> 04:43:53,348
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE

1850
04:43:53,348 --> 04:43:53,982
COMMITTEE HEARING THEY BROUGHT

1851
04:43:53,982 --> 04:43:54,549
IN A FEMALE PROSECUTOR TO

1852
04:43:54,549 --> 04:43:55,150
QUESTION THE VICTIM, DR. FORD,

1853
04:43:55,150 --> 04:43:55,817
BUT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD, AS

1854
04:43:55,817 --> 04:43:56,418
I'M WATCHING SENATOR FLAKE'S

1855
04:43:56,418 --> 04:43:57,052
FACE AND THEY'RE DEMANDING SOME

1856
04:43:57,052 --> 04:43:57,719
SORT OF RESPONSE FROM HIM AS TO

1857
04:43:57,719 --> 04:43:58,353
WHETHER OR NOT HE KNOWS JUDGE

1858
04:43:58,353 --> 04:43:58,987
KAVANAUGH AND HE SAID HE DID

1859
04:43:58,987 --> 04:43:59,621
BELIEVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IT'S

1860
04:43:59,621 --> 04:44:00,288
JUST VERY EASY I WOULD THINK FOR

1861
04:44:00,288 --> 04:44:00,922
SOME OF THESE SENATORS TO SAY

1862
04:44:00,922 --> 04:44:01,590
THE WRONG THING WHEN THEY TALK

1863
04:44:01,590 --> 04:44:02,224
ABOUT HOW THEY WERE PERSONALLY

1864
04:44:02,224 --> 04:44:02,891
VIOLATED IT'S GOT TO BE A TIGHT

1865
04:44:02,891 --> 04:44:03,358
ROPE WALK FOR THEM.

1866
04:44:03,425 --> 04:44:03,992
>> IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING

1867
04:44:03,992 --> 04:44:04,593
THEY'RE NOT USED TO AND THE

1868
04:44:04,593 --> 04:44:05,260
REASON WHY THEY BROUGHT IN THAT

1869
04:44:05,260 --> 04:44:05,927
PROSECUTOR FROM MARICOPA COUNTY,

1870
04:44:05,927 --> 04:44:06,528
ARIZONA WHO QUIZZED DR. FORD

1871
04:44:06,528 --> 04:44:06,962
DURING THE HEARING.

1872
04:44:06,962 --> 04:44:07,596
THERE WAS GRAVE CONCERN A PANEL

1873
04:44:07,596 --> 04:44:08,230
OF ALL WHITE OLDER MEN TRYING TO

1874
04:44:08,230 --> 04:44:08,864
ASK THIS WOMAN QUESTIONS WOULD

1875
04:44:08,864 --> 04:44:09,564
BE SEEN IN THIS ERA AS SOMETHING

1876
04:44:09,564 --> 04:44:10,232
JUST TOTALLY OUT OF THE NORM AND

1877
04:44:10,232 --> 04:44:10,866
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE REALLY

1878
04:44:10,866 --> 04:44:11,266
POLITICALLY RISKY.

1879
04:44:11,266 --> 04:44:11,867
THEY TOOK IT, THEMSELVES TO

1880
04:44:11,867 --> 04:44:12,467
QUESTION JUDGE KAVANAUGH, OR

1881
04:44:12,467 --> 04:44:12,968
SPEAK TO HIS CHARACTER.

1882
04:44:12,968 --> 04:44:13,635
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT A LOT OF THESE

1883
04:44:13,635 --> 04:44:14,169
PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY

1884
04:44:14,169 --> 04:44:14,836
CONFRONTED ON A REGULAR BAY SUS.

1885
04:44:14,836 --> 04:44:15,504
NOT ONLY ARE THEY OLDER MEN BUT

1886
04:44:15,504 --> 04:44:16,171
CAN COME IN STATES THAT SUPPORT

1887
04:44:16,171 --> 04:44:16,805
THE PRESIDENT, THAT ARE MORE

1888
04:44:16,805 --> 04:44:17,439
CONSERVE TIFF WHERE VOTERS ARE

1889
04:44:17,439 --> 04:44:17,939
PROBABLY FAVORING JUDGE

1890
04:44:17,939 --> 04:44:18,573
KAVANAUGH OVER THE ALTERNATIVE

1891
04:44:18,573 --> 04:44:19,241
AND CORRECT TO SEE PEOPLE LIKE

1892
04:44:19,241 --> 04:44:19,775
HIM WHEN 2 TO HIS RULE IT

1893
04:44:19,775 --> 04:44:20,075
BECOMES IN

1894
04:44:20,075 --> 04:44:20,676
CONNECTION WITH HIS IDEOLOGY,

1895
04:44:20,676 --> 04:44:21,309
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER ONES IN

1896
04:44:21,309 --> 04:44:21,943
PLACES LIKE ARIZONA, TEXAS FOR

1897
04:44:21,943 --> 04:44:22,511
TED CRUZ, IS FACING A BIG

1898
04:44:22,511 --> 04:44:23,011
RE-ELECTION THIS YEAR.

1899
04:44:23,011 --> 04:44:23,612
YESTERDAY BROKE ALL SORTS OF

1900
04:44:23,612 --> 04:44:23,812
NORMS.

1901
04:44:23,812 --> 04:44:24,379
THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF

1902
04:44:24,379 --> 04:44:24,646
DEQUORUM.

1903
04:44:24,646 --> 04:44:25,180
I DO WONDER BECAUSE WE'VE

1904
04:44:25,180 --> 04:44:25,781
STARTED TO SEE A LOT MORE OF

1905
04:44:25,781 --> 04:44:26,248
THIS, WHETHER DIRECT

1906
04:44:26,248 --> 04:44:26,882
CONFRONTATION, EITHER HERE OR

1907
04:44:26,882 --> 04:44:27,516
WHEN THEY'RE OUT FOR DINNER, ON

1908
04:44:27,516 --> 04:44:28,150
THE AIRPLANE HOME, WHETHER THAT

1909
04:44:28,150 --> 04:44:28,750
WILL BE THE NORM AND WHETHER

1910
04:44:28,750 --> 04:44:29,217
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

1911
04:44:29,217 --> 04:44:29,851
WE'VE SEEN THE THREATS AGAINST

1912
04:44:29,851 --> 04:44:30,452
LAW MAKERS SPIKE TO RECORD

1913
04:44:30,452 --> 04:44:31,053
LEVELS ESPECIALLY REPUBLICANS

1914
04:44:31,053 --> 04:44:31,620
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN POWER.

1915
04:44:31,620 --> 04:44:32,187
IT'S SOMETHING THAT ARE NOT

1916
04:44:32,187 --> 04:44:32,721
ACCUSTOMED TO AND FRANKLY

1917
04:44:32,721 --> 04:44:33,422
THEY'RE CONCERNED AND AFRAID OF.

1918
04:44:33,488 --> 04:44:34,156
>> IT'S DEFINITELY UNDER -- ONE

1919
04:44:34,156 --> 04:44:34,756
CAN UNDERSTAND I'M THINKING

1920
04:44:34,756 --> 04:44:35,357
ABOUT ORIN HATCH BEING ASKED

1921
04:44:35,357 --> 04:44:35,991
WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT DR. FORD

1922
04:44:35,991 --> 04:44:36,625
WAS SHE WAS ATTRACTED AND NICE

1923
04:44:36,625 --> 04:44:37,292
AND UNDERSTOOD AS AN ATTRACTIVE

1924
04:44:37,292 --> 04:44:37,993
WITNESS BUT IT WAS JUST SORT OF

1925
04:44:37,993 --> 04:44:38,593
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF, YOU KNOW,

1926
04:44:38,593 --> 04:44:39,227
HERE'S A GUY THAT MAY NOT QUITE

1927
04:44:39,227 --> 04:44:39,895
SORT OF GET IT, WHAT'S HAPPENING

1928
04:44:39,895 --> 04:44:40,095
HERE.

1929
04:44:40,095 --> 04:44:40,662
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

1930
04:44:40,662 --> 04:44:41,329
COMMITTEE ROOM BUT I WANT TO ASK

1931
04:44:41,329 --> 04:44:41,897
YOU ONE MORE QUESTION, IF

1932
04:44:41,897 --> 04:44:42,597
DEMOCRATS DO NOT RETURN AT 1:30,

1933
04:44:42,597 --> 04:44:43,131
DOES THE VOTE GO AHEAD?

1934
04:44:43,131 --> 04:44:43,832
DOES IT MATTER HOW MANY SENATORS

1935
04:44:43,832 --> 04:44:44,166
ARE THERE?

1936
04:44:44,232 --> 04:44:44,900
>> YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE QUORUM,

1937
04:44:44,900 --> 04:44:45,600
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

1938
04:44:45,600 --> 04:44:46,268
AT LEAST ONE OR TWO DEMOCRATS IN

1939
04:44:46,268 --> 04:44:46,935
THE ROOM AND YOU PROBABLY WILL,

1940
04:44:46,935 --> 04:44:47,602
AND IN THEY DO AND WE ALREADY

1941
04:44:47,602 --> 04:44:48,303
SENSE AND KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE

1942
04:44:48,303 --> 04:44:48,970
A PARTY LINE VOTE, IT'S GOING TO

1943
04:44:48,970 --> 04:44:49,471
BE 11 YESES AND HOWEVER

1944
04:44:49,471 --> 04:44:49,938
DEMOCRATS SHOWED UP.

1945
04:44:49,938 --> 04:44:50,572
I THINK IF THEY'RE NOT THERE,

1946
04:44:50,572 --> 04:44:51,206
THEY'RE RECORDED AS NOT PRESENT

1947
04:44:51,206 --> 04:44:51,807
UNLESS THEY SENT A PROXY VOTE

1948
04:44:51,807 --> 04:44:52,507
AND I DON'T KNOW IN THE CASE OF

1949
04:44:52,507 --> 04:44:53,141
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THEY

1950
04:44:53,141 --> 04:44:53,475
CAN DO THAT.

1951
04:44:53,475 --> 04:44:54,109
YOU'RE TESTING MY KNOWLEDGE OF

1952
04:44:54,109 --> 04:44:54,676
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RULES.

1953
04:44:54,676 --> 04:44:55,343
I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D HAVE TO GET

1954
04:44:55,343 --> 04:44:55,610
INTO IT.

1955
04:44:55,677 --> 04:44:56,044
>> I'M SORRY.

1956
04:44:56,111 --> 04:44:56,845
>> SUCH AS THE TIMES WE LIVE IN.

1957
04:44:56,912 --> 04:44:57,512
>> I'M SORRY EVERY QUESTION I

1958
04:44:57,512 --> 04:44:58,180
USUALLY COME AT YOU, YOU COME

1959
04:44:58,180 --> 04:44:58,747
BACK WITH A GREAT ANSWER.

1960
04:44:58,814 --> 04:44:59,414
>> WE HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE

1961
04:44:59,414 --> 04:44:59,648
BARREL.

1962
04:44:59,648 --> 04:45:00,282
ED O'KEEFE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1963
04:45:00,282 --> 04:45:00,916
>>> WE'RE GOING TO HEAD BACK

1964
04:45:00,916 --> 04:45:01,516
INTO THE COMMITTEE ROOM NOW.

1965
04:45:01,516 --> 04:45:02,117
SENATOR LEHI IS TALKING.

1966
04:45:02,184 --> 04:45:02,818
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S DEFIANT AND

1967
04:45:02,818 --> 04:45:03,452
EVASIVENESS, VEHEMENT ATTACKS IN

1968
04:45:03,452 --> 04:45:04,152
THEHE FACE OF POWERFUL AND WILL

1969
04:45:04,152 --> 04:45:04,653
INCRIMINATING TESTIMONY

1970
04:45:04,653 --> 04:45:05,253
SURPASSING THAT OF CLARENCE

1971
04:45:05,253 --> 04:45:05,721
THOMAS AND ANITA HILL.

1972
04:45:05,721 --> 04:45:06,354
HE TRIED TO PORTRAY DR. FORD'S

1973
04:45:06,354 --> 04:45:06,888
ALLEGATION AS PART OF A

1974
04:45:06,888 --> 04:45:07,456
CALCULATION K ISOLATED AND

1975
04:45:07,456 --> 04:45:08,090
ORCHESTRATED -- CALCULATED AND

1976
04:45:08,090 --> 04:45:08,490
ORCHESTRATED HIT.

1977
04:45:08,490 --> 04:45:09,124
PEOPLE TRY TO BLAME THE VICTIM,

1978
04:45:09,124 --> 04:45:09,725
NOT TO OWN UP TO THEIR OWN

1979
04:45:09,725 --> 04:45:09,925
DEEDS.

1980
04:45:09,925 --> 04:45:10,459
HE ANGLY ASSERTED BAYLESS

1981
04:45:10,459 --> 04:45:11,059
POLITICAL TIRADES AND WAS ALL

1982
04:45:11,059 --> 04:45:11,727
TOO EAGER TO PROMOTE THE TALKING

1983
04:45:11,727 --> 04:45:12,294
POINT SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS

1984
04:45:12,294 --> 04:45:12,861
LYING IN WAIT WITH THIS

1985
04:45:12,861 --> 04:45:13,395
ALLEGATION AND CLAIMED THE

1986
04:45:13,395 --> 04:45:13,995
ALLEGATIONS WERE DRIVEN BY

1987
04:45:13,995 --> 04:45:14,563
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE

1988
04:45:14,563 --> 04:45:14,830
CLINTONS.

1989
04:45:14,830 --> 04:45:15,530
IT'S HARD TO MAKE THIS STUFF UP.

1990
04:45:15,530 --> 04:45:16,164
THAT AMOUNTS TO CONSPIRTORYIAL

1991
04:45:16,164 --> 04:45:16,398
MADNESS.

1992
04:45:16,398 --> 04:45:17,065
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH VOLATILITY,

1993
04:45:17,065 --> 04:45:17,632
PARTISAN SHIP AND LACK OF

1994
04:45:17,632 --> 04:45:18,233
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT FROM ANY

1995
04:45:18,233 --> 04:45:18,800
NOMINEE, ANY COURT, IN ANY

1996
04:45:18,800 --> 04:45:19,167
ADMINISTRATION.

1997
04:45:19,167 --> 04:45:19,768
THERE IS NO SECRET THAT I'M

1998
04:45:19,768 --> 04:45:20,368
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT JUSTICE

1999
04:45:20,368 --> 04:45:20,969
KAVANAUGH WOULD MEAN FOR THE

2000
04:45:20,969 --> 04:45:21,636
WRITINGS OF WOMEN, FOR WORKERS,

2001
04:45:21,636 --> 04:45:22,304
FOR UNCHECKED PRESIDENTIAL POWER

2002
04:45:22,304 --> 04:45:22,871
AND OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES.

2003
04:45:22,871 --> 04:45:23,472
I ALSO BELIEVE HE'S UNFIT TO

2004
04:45:23,472 --> 04:45:24,106
SERVE ON OUR NATION'S HIGHEST

2005
04:45:24,106 --> 04:45:24,773
COURT BECAUSE OF HIS HISTORY OF

2006
04:45:24,773 --> 04:45:25,340
MISLEADING THE SENATE WHILE

2007
04:45:25,340 --> 04:45:25,640
UNDER OATH.

2008
04:45:25,640 --> 04:45:26,341
BUT AS SERIOUS AS THESE CONCERNS

2009
04:45:26,341 --> 04:45:26,875
ARE, THIS IS DIFFERENT.

2010
04:45:26,875 --> 04:45:27,542
VOTING TO ADVANCE AND ULTIMATELY

2011
04:45:27,542 --> 04:45:28,143
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHILE

2012
04:45:28,143 --> 04:45:28,777
HE'S UNDER THIS DARK CLOUD OF

2013
04:45:28,777 --> 04:45:29,411
SUSPICION, WILL FOREVER CHANGE

2014
04:45:29,411 --> 04:45:29,978
THIS SENATE AND OUR NATION'S

2015
04:45:29,978 --> 04:45:30,312
HIGHEST COURT.

2016
04:45:30,312 --> 04:45:30,912
HE POLITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT

2017
04:45:30,912 --> 04:45:31,580
WHICH SHOULD BE ABOVE POLITICS

2018
04:45:31,580 --> 04:45:32,147
AND FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL

2019
04:45:32,147 --> 04:45:32,748
VIOLENCE STRUGGLING TO COME

2020
04:45:32,748 --> 04:45:33,415
FORWARD, THE CONSEQUENCES MAY BE

2021
04:45:33,415 --> 04:45:33,715
EVEN WORSE.

2022
04:45:33,715 --> 04:45:34,349
EVERY ONE OF US WHO HAS BEEN A

2023
04:45:34,349 --> 04:45:34,983
PROSECUTOR HAS SEEN HOW HARD IT

2024
04:45:34,983 --> 04:45:35,650
IS SOMETIMES FOR VICTIMS TO COME

2025
04:45:35,650 --> 04:45:36,284
FORWARD AND ARE WE SENDING THE

2026
04:45:36,284 --> 04:45:36,885
SIGNAL THAT YOU STAY THERE,

2027
04:45:36,885 --> 04:45:37,285
DON'T COME FORTH?

2028
04:45:37,285 --> 04:45:37,886
YOU KNOW HOW THIS COMMITTEE

2029
04:45:37,886 --> 04:45:38,553
HANDLE THIS IS NOMINATION WILL

2030
04:45:38,553 --> 04:45:39,254
BE VIEWED AS A REFLECTION OF OUR

2031
04:45:39,254 --> 04:45:39,821
SERIOUSLY OUR SOCIETY VIEWS

2032
04:45:39,821 --> 04:45:40,388
CREDIBLE CLAIMS OF SEXUAL

2033
04:45:40,388 --> 04:45:40,689
MISCONDUCT.

2034
04:45:40,689 --> 04:45:41,356
DURING DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY, THE

2035
04:45:41,356 --> 04:45:41,990
NATIONAL SEXUAL HOTLINE SAW AN

2036
04:45:41,990 --> 04:45:42,657
UNPRECEDENTED 147% INCREASE IN

2037
04:45:42,657 --> 04:45:42,858
CALLS.

2038
04:45:42,858 --> 04:45:43,458
WHEN SURVIVORS SEE US TAKING

2039
04:45:43,458 --> 04:45:43,992
SEXUAL ASSAULT SERIOUSLY,

2040
04:45:43,992 --> 04:45:44,559
THEY'RE EMPOWERED TO COME

2041
04:45:44,559 --> 04:45:44,793
FORWARD.

2042
04:45:44,793 --> 04:45:45,360
IF THEY SEE US CAL USUALLY

2043
04:45:45,360 --> 04:45:46,027
SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG I FEEL

2044
04:45:46,027 --> 04:45:46,561
THEY'LL HAVE DISASTERS,

2045
04:45:46,561 --> 04:45:46,895
CONSEQUENCES.

2046
04:45:46,895 --> 04:45:47,496
IF VICTIMS THINK THEY'LL NEVER

2047
04:45:47,496 --> 04:45:48,163
BE BELIEVED OR NOT MATTER EVEN

2048
04:45:48,163 --> 04:45:48,797
IF THEY ARE BELIEVED, THEN WHY

2049
04:45:48,797 --> 04:45:49,264
COME FORWARD AT ALL.

2050
04:45:49,264 --> 04:45:49,965
DR. FORD DESERVES TO BE HEARD.

2051
04:45:49,965 --> 04:45:50,632
AND THAT MUST MEAN MORE THAN

2052
04:45:50,632 --> 04:45:51,099
JUST CHECKING A BOX.

2053
04:45:51,099 --> 04:45:51,767
REMEMBER, DR. FORD DID NOT SPEND

2054
04:45:51,767 --> 04:45:52,400
HER ENTIRE LIFE PREPARING FOR

2055
04:45:52,400 --> 04:45:52,701
THIS MOMENT.

2056
04:45:52,701 --> 04:45:53,368
SHE IS NOT BACKED BY THE MOST

2057
04:45:53,368 --> 04:45:53,902
POWERFUL OFFICIALS IN OUR

2058
04:45:53,902 --> 04:45:54,336
NATION'S GOVERNMENT.

2059
04:45:54,336 --> 04:45:54,870
SHE DID NOT COME WITH A

2060
04:45:54,870 --> 04:45:55,470
POLITICAL AGENDA AND DID NOT

2061
04:45:55,470 --> 04:45:56,138
TESTIFY WITH A JOB PROMOTION ON

2062
04:45:56,138 --> 04:45:56,404
THE LINE.

2063
04:45:56,404 --> 04:45:57,038
SHE DID NOT EVADE OUR QUESTIONS

2064
04:45:57,038 --> 04:45:57,606
AND SHE DID NOT DEMEAN OUR

2065
04:45:57,606 --> 04:45:58,306
MOTIVES OF EITHER REPUBLICANS OR

2066
04:45:58,306 --> 04:45:58,573
DEMOCRATS.

2067
04:45:58,573 --> 04:45:59,274
SHE INSTEAD PLAINLY, WITH GRACE,

2068
04:45:59,274 --> 04:45:59,875
AND AT TIMES E EMOTIONALLY,

2069
04:45:59,875 --> 04:46:00,475
RECOUNTED THE DRAMA THAT SHE

2070
04:46:00,475 --> 04:46:01,076
EXPERIENCED AS A 15-YEAR-OLD

2071
04:46:01,076 --> 04:46:01,276
GIRL.

2072
04:46:01,276 --> 04:46:01,943
TRAUMA HAS BEEN HAUNTING HER FOR

2073
04:46:01,943 --> 04:46:02,410
THE 36 YEARS SINCE.

2074
04:46:02,410 --> 04:46:02,944
SHE HAD NOTHING TO GAIN,

2075
04:46:02,944 --> 04:46:03,578
EVERYTHING TO LOSE, BY COMING

2076
04:46:03,578 --> 04:46:03,812
FORWARD.

2077
04:46:03,812 --> 04:46:04,479
I LISTEN CLOSELY TO BOTH HER AND

2078
04:46:04,479 --> 04:46:05,080
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND I BELIEVE

2079
04:46:05,080 --> 04:46:05,714
HER AS I BELIEVED ANITA HILL.

2080
04:46:05,714 --> 04:46:06,314
I'LL BE VOTING NO ON JUDGE

2081
04:46:06,314 --> 04:46:06,815
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION.

2082
04:46:06,815 --> 04:46:07,516
HE DOES NOT HAVE THE VERACITY OR

2083
04:46:07,516 --> 04:46:08,183
TEMPERAMENT TO THE HIGHER COURT

2084
04:46:08,183 --> 04:46:08,517
IN OUR NATION.

2085
04:46:08,517 --> 04:46:09,184
AND NO SUCH NOMINEE SHOULD BE

2086
04:46:09,184 --> 04:46:09,851
CONFIRMED IN THE FACE OF SUCH

2087
04:46:09,851 --> 04:46:10,318
SERIOUS, CREDIBLE, AND

2088
04:46:10,318 --> 04:46:10,919
UNRESOLVED -- AND UNRESOLVED

2089
04:46:10,919 --> 04:46:11,586
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

2090
04:46:11,653 --> 04:46:12,087
>> SENATOR GRAHAM.

2091
04:46:12,154 --> 04:46:12,487
>> THANK YOU.

2092
04:46:12,487 --> 04:46:13,155
I KNOW I'M A SINGLE WHITE MALE

2093
04:46:13,155 --> 04:46:13,822
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AND I'M TOLD

2094
04:46:13,822 --> 04:46:14,523
I SHOULD SHUT UP BUT I WILL NOT

2095
04:46:14,523 --> 04:46:15,190
SHUT UP IF THAT'S OKAY, BECAUSE

2096
04:46:15,190 --> 04:46:15,724
I GOT HERE THE SAME WAY

2097
04:46:15,724 --> 04:46:16,191
EVERYBODY ELSE DID.

2098
04:46:16,191 --> 04:46:16,825
THE PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA

2099
04:46:16,825 --> 04:46:17,459
VOTED FOR ME AND SENATOR SCOTT

2100
04:46:17,459 --> 04:46:18,059
TO BE THEIR VOICE OF MEN AND

2101
04:46:18,059 --> 04:46:18,760
WOMEN AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE

2102
04:46:18,760 --> 04:46:19,394
THEIR VOICE TODAY AND MAYBE NOT

2103
04:46:19,394 --> 04:46:19,995
JUST FOR SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT A

2104
04:46:19,995 --> 04:46:20,662
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS

2105
04:46:20,662 --> 04:46:20,996
GOING ON HERE.

2106
04:46:20,996 --> 04:46:21,630
JOE BIDEN, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE

2107
04:46:21,630 --> 04:46:22,164
SAYING THIS ON OUR SIDE,

2108
04:46:22,164 --> 04:46:22,731
LISTENED TO JOE, BUT JOE WAS

2109
04:46:22,731 --> 04:46:23,064
RIGHT A LOT.

2110
04:46:23,064 --> 04:46:23,732
JOE BIDEN IS A UNIQUE GUY, IF

2111
04:46:23,732 --> 04:46:24,366
YOU HAD ONE LAST CONVERSATION

2112
04:46:24,366 --> 04:46:25,000
BEFORE YOU DIE, YOU'D WANT TO

2113
04:46:25,000 --> 04:46:25,433
HAVE IT WITH JOE.

2114
04:46:25,433 --> 04:46:26,067
YOU'D BE AROUND FOR A WHILE.

2115
04:46:26,067 --> 04:46:26,501
HE'S A DECENT GUY.

2116
04:46:26,501 --> 04:46:27,035
IF HE RUNS FOR PRESIDENT,

2117
04:46:27,035 --> 04:46:27,402
BE HART TO BEAT.

2118
04:46:27,402 --> 04:46:27,969
HE CAME TO SENATOR THURMAN'S

2119
04:46:27,969 --> 04:46:28,203
FUNERAL.

2120
04:46:28,203 --> 04:46:28,904
HE SAID I JUST LIKE THE OLD GUY.

2121
04:46:28,904 --> 04:46:29,504
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM AND I

2122
04:46:29,504 --> 04:46:30,172
DIDN'T LIKE SOME OF THE THINGS

2123
04:46:30,172 --> 04:46:30,806
HE DID IN HIS LIFE, BUT WHEN I

2124
04:46:30,806 --> 04:46:31,439
WAS DOWN AND OUT HE WAS THERE

2125
04:46:31,439 --> 04:46:31,673
FOR ME.

2126
04:46:31,673 --> 04:46:32,274
AND TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

2127
04:46:32,274 --> 04:46:32,908
OTHER SIDE, THIS WILL END AND

2128
04:46:32,908 --> 04:46:33,508
WE'LL SEE WHAT WE DO NEXT.

2129
04:46:33,508 --> 04:46:34,176
I HOPE WE CAN MUSTER THE ABILITY

2130
04:46:34,176 --> 04:46:34,743
TO COME FORWARD, BUT FROM

2131
04:46:34,743 --> 04:46:35,410
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WHERE WE FIND

2132
04:46:35,410 --> 04:46:36,044
OURSELVES AND HOW WE GOT HERE.

2133
04:46:36,044 --> 04:46:36,611
I WROTE A BOOK AND I THINK

2134
04:46:36,611 --> 04:46:37,279
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL IS THE ONLY

2135
04:46:37,279 --> 04:46:37,746
PERSON THAT READ IT.

2136
04:46:37,746 --> 04:46:38,346
IT WAS ONLINE AND I GOT 1% SO

2137
04:46:38,346 --> 04:46:38,880
I'VE HAD MY TIME TO BE

2138
04:46:38,880 --> 04:46:39,147
PRESIDENT.

2139
04:46:39,147 --> 04:46:39,581
DIDN'T GO VERY FAR

2140
04:46:39,581 --> 04:46:39,881
AND I LOST.

2141
04:46:39,881 --> 04:46:40,515
I DIDN'T THINK TRUMP WOULD WIN.

2142
04:46:40,515 --> 04:46:41,116
I RAN OUT OF ORANGETIVES TO

2143
04:46:41,116 --> 04:46:41,783
DESCRIBE ABOUT HOW I FELT -- OUT

2144
04:46:41,783 --> 04:46:42,384
OF ADJECTIVES AND ABOUT HOW I

2145
04:46:42,384 --> 04:46:42,884
FELT ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN.

2146
04:46:42,884 --> 04:46:43,451
HE WON AND I LOST AND HE'S

2147
04:46:43,451 --> 04:46:44,119
PRESIDENT AND I'LL TRY TO HELP

2148
04:46:44,119 --> 04:46:44,786
HIM WHERE I CAN AND SAY NO WHEN

2149
04:46:44,786 --> 04:46:45,420
HI MUST AND THE ELECTION'S --

2150
04:46:45,420 --> 04:46:46,021
SAY NO WHEN I MUST AND THE

2151
04:46:46,021 --> 04:46:46,521
ELECTION'S OVER FOR ME.

2152
04:46:46,521 --> 04:46:47,189
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL HIM YOU HAD

2153
04:46:47,189 --> 04:46:47,889
A CHOICE TO MAKE FOR THE SUPREME

2154
04:46:47,889 --> 04:46:48,423
COURT VACANCY OF JUSTICE

2155
04:46:48,423 --> 04:46:48,657
KENNEDY.

2156
04:46:48,657 --> 04:46:49,324
I THINK DID YOU A GOOD JOB, MR.

2157
04:46:49,324 --> 04:46:49,591
PRESIDENT.

2158
04:46:49,591 --> 04:46:50,158
FOR SOMEBODY WHO SUPPOSEDLY

2159
04:46:50,158 --> 04:46:50,692
CRAZY AND THERE IS CHAOS

2160
04:46:50,692 --> 04:46:51,326
EVERYWHERE, HE DID A GOOD JOB

2161
04:46:51,326 --> 04:46:51,526
HERE.

2162
04:46:51,526 --> 04:46:52,093
NOW WHY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

2163
04:46:52,093 --> 04:46:52,727
GORSUCH AND KENNEDY -- GORSUCH

2164
04:46:52,727 --> 04:46:53,094
AND KAVANAUGH?

2165
04:46:53,094 --> 04:46:53,562
IT'S THE KENNEDY SEEP.

2166
04:46:53,562 --> 04:46:54,229
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT YOU'RE NOT

2167
04:46:54,229 --> 04:46:54,729
PAYING MUCH ATTENTION.

2168
04:46:54,729 --> 04:46:55,363
GORSUCH IS AN EVEN SWAP FOR J

2169
04:46:55,363 --> 04:46:55,597
ANTONIN

2170
04:46:55,597 --> 04:46:56,264
SCALIA, BUT THIS IS THE GUY IN

2171
04:46:56,264 --> 04:46:56,965
THE MIDDLE THAT RISKS, KAVANAUGH

2172
04:46:56,965 --> 04:46:57,566
CLERKED FOR JUSTICE KENNEDY.

2173
04:46:57,566 --> 04:46:58,166
WOULD YOU HAVE PICKED HIM?

2174
04:46:58,166 --> 04:46:58,800
NO, BUT YOU LOST THE ELECTION.

2175
04:46:58,800 --> 04:46:59,501
AND THAT DOES HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

2176
04:46:59,501 --> 04:47:00,068
WHEN I SAID IT, ABOUT OBAMA

2177
04:47:00,068 --> 04:47:00,502
WINNING, I MEANT IT.

2178
04:47:00,502 --> 04:47:01,136
MERRICK GARLAND, ANTONIN SCALIA

2179
04:47:01,136 --> 04:47:01,770
DIES IN THE ELECTION YEAR, THE

2180
04:47:01,770 --> 04:47:02,337
LAST YEAR OF THE TERM OF

04:47:02,337 --> 04:47:02,971
PRESIDENT OBAMA, THE PRIMARIES

2182
04:47:02,971 --> 04:47:03,438
ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY.

2183
04:47:03,438 --> 04:47:04,039
NOT IN 100 YEARS HAS ANYBODY

2184
04:47:04,039 --> 04:47:04,639
BEEN NOMINATED UNDERSTAND THAT

2185
04:47:04,639 --> 04:47:05,273
CIRCUMSTANCE SO I DON'T THINK I

2186
04:47:05,273 --> 04:47:05,907
DID ANYTHING UNFAIR TO GARLAND.

2187
04:47:05,907 --> 04:47:06,575
AS TO SOTOMAYOR, I WAS TOLD THEY

2188
04:47:06,575 --> 04:47:07,209
HATE GUNS AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP

2189
04:47:07,209 --> 04:47:07,642
THEM OFF THE COURT.

2190
04:47:07,642 --> 04:47:08,276
THEY HATE GUNS, ON, AND ON, AND

2191
04:47:08,276 --> 04:47:08,443
ON.

2192
04:47:08,443 --> 04:47:09,144
I TRIED TO GO BACK TO WHAT THIS

2193
04:47:09,144 --> 04:47:09,644
COMMITTEE USED TO DO.

2194
04:47:09,644 --> 04:47:10,312
THURMAN VOTED BECAUSE HE DIDN'T

2195
04:47:10,312 --> 04:47:10,946
AGREE WITH THEIR PHILOSOPHY, I

2196
04:47:10,946 --> 04:47:11,613
THINK HE SAW IN HER A QUALIFIED

2197
04:47:11,613 --> 04:47:12,247
PERSON AND HOT I GUESS VOTED FOR

2198
04:47:12,247 --> 04:47:12,480
SCALIA.

2199
04:47:12,480 --> 04:47:12,881
THE SAME IS TRUE.

2200
04:47:12,881 --> 04:47:13,248
96 AND 97 VOTES.

2201
04:47:13,248 --> 04:47:13,615
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

2202
04:47:13,615 --> 04:47:14,216
MOST OF THE NOMINEES IN THE

2203
04:47:14,216 --> 04:47:14,749
SUPREME COURT NEVER HAD A

2204
04:47:14,749 --> 04:47:14,983
HEARING.

2205
04:47:14,983 --> 04:47:15,550
IT WAS ALWAYS JUST ASSUMED

2206
04:47:15,550 --> 04:47:16,151
THEY'RE QUALIFIED AND ARE NOT

2207
04:47:16,151 --> 04:47:16,718
HACKS, THEY'RE GOING TO GO

2208
04:47:16,718 --> 04:47:16,952
FORWARD.

2209
04:47:16,952 --> 04:47:17,385
ELECTIONS DO MATTER.

2210
04:47:17,385 --> 04:47:17,953
WHEN IT COMES TO PRESIDENT

2211
04:47:17,953 --> 04:47:18,520
TRUMP, ELECTIONS DO MATTER.

2212
04:47:18,520 --> 04:47:19,154
NOW, ABOUT THE LAW, AND TO MY

2213
04:47:19,154 --> 04:47:19,654
FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN

2214
04:47:19,654 --> 04:47:19,955
PROSECUTORS.

2215
04:47:19,955 --> 04:47:20,555
I'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR, I'VE

2216
04:47:20,555 --> 04:47:21,223
BEEN A DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND I'VE

2217
04:47:21,223 --> 04:47:21,556
BEEN A JUDGE.

2218
04:47:21,556 --> 04:47:22,090
EVERY WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN

2219
04:47:22,090 --> 04:47:22,724
VICTIMIZED NEEDS TO BE HEARD,

2220
04:47:22,724 --> 04:47:23,358
COUNT ME IN A THOUSAND TIMES

2221
04:47:23,358 --> 04:47:23,558
OVER.

2222
04:47:23,558 --> 04:47:24,192
COUNT ME IN FOR THE PROPOSITION

2223
04:47:24,192 --> 04:47:24,759
OF EVERY ONE WOMAN WHO COMES

2224
04:47:24,759 --> 04:47:25,427
FORWARD, ONLY GOD KNOWS HOW MANY

2225
04:47:25,427 --> 04:47:26,094
WOMEN AND CHILDREN GO TO THEIR

2226
04:47:26,094 --> 04:47:26,595
GRAVE WITH THE ABUSE.

2227
04:47:26,595 --> 04:47:27,195
IF YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT, YOU

2228
04:47:27,195 --> 04:47:27,796
JUST DON'T KNOW THIS AREA OF

2229
04:47:27,796 --> 04:47:28,430
LIFE, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE

2230
04:47:28,430 --> 04:47:29,030
HEARD IN THE UNITED STATES.

2231
04:47:29,030 --> 04:47:29,631
I HAD A YOUNG MAN ACCUSED OF

2232
04:47:29,631 --> 04:47:30,298
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN I WAS IN THE

2233
04:47:30,298 --> 04:47:30,966
AIR FORCE AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

2234
04:47:30,966 --> 04:47:31,633
THE CASE EVENTUALLY FELL APART

2235
04:47:31,633 --> 04:47:32,300
AND HE ALMOST KILLED HIMSELF.

2236
04:47:32,300 --> 04:47:32,968
I HAD WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN GANG

2237
04:47:32,968 --> 04:47:33,668
RAPED AND DIDN'T WANT TO TESTIFY

2238
04:47:33,668 --> 04:47:34,236
BUT THEY DID, ALONG WITH

2239
04:47:34,236 --> 04:47:34,903
COUNSELORS, I SAT WITH THEM ALL

2240
04:47:34,903 --> 04:47:35,103
NIGHT.

2241
04:47:35,103 --> 04:47:35,403
TOUGH STUFF.

2242
04:47:35,403 --> 04:47:35,670
EMOTIONAL.

2243
04:47:35,670 --> 04:47:36,204
WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED?

2244
04:47:36,204 --> 04:47:36,872
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS LEGAL STUFF

2245
04:47:36,872 --> 04:47:37,272
MOST OF MY LIFE.

2246
04:47:37,272 --> 04:47:37,772
I'VE NEVER HEARD A MORE

2247
04:47:37,772 --> 04:47:38,340
COMPELLING DEFENSE OF ONE'S

2248
04:47:38,340 --> 04:47:38,940
HONOR AND SBEGITY THAN I DID

2249
04:47:38,940 --> 04:47:39,407
FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH.

2250
04:47:39,407 --> 04:47:39,941
HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE,

2251
04:47:39,941 --> 04:47:40,609
EVERYBODY IN THE EYE AND HE WAS

2252
04:47:40,609 --> 04:47:41,309
MAD AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAD.

2253
04:47:41,309 --> 04:47:41,943
HE COULD TELL YOU WHERE HE WAS

2254
04:47:41,943 --> 04:47:42,577
AT AND WHAT HE WAS DOING HIGH

2255
04:47:42,577 --> 04:47:43,245
SCHOOL IN A WAY THAT JUST BLEW

2256
04:47:43,245 --> 04:47:43,478
ME AWAY.

2257
04:47:43,478 --> 04:47:44,112
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND WOMEN, IF

2258
04:47:44,112 --> 04:47:44,746
YOU'RE A GANG RAPIST IN HIGH

2259
04:47:44,746 --> 04:47:45,347
SCHOOL, YOU DON'T LET IT GO.

2260
04:47:45,347 --> 04:47:45,947
EVERYONE WOMAN WHO KNOWS BRETT

2261
04:47:45,947 --> 04:47:46,548
KAVANAUGH HAS COME FORWARD TO

2262
04:47:46,548 --> 04:47:47,249
SAY HE'S NOT THAT KIND OF GUY.

2263
04:47:47,249 --> 04:47:47,849
HE'S BEEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL

2264
04:47:47,849 --> 04:47:48,416
OFFER IS HAVE YOU, SIX FBI

2265
04:47:48,416 --> 04:47:49,084
INVESTIGATIONS AND WE MISSED THE

2266
04:47:49,084 --> 04:47:49,718
SOPHOMORE JUNIOR GANG RAPIST.

2267
04:47:49,718 --> 04:47:50,151
WE DIDN'T MISS IT.

2268
04:47:50,151 --> 04:47:50,685
IT'S A BUNCH OF GARBAGE.

2269
04:47:50,685 --> 04:47:51,353
WE'RE IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE AND

2270
04:47:51,353 --> 04:47:51,920
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY, MS.

2271
04:47:51,920 --> 04:47:52,520
FORD, ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT MS.

2272
04:47:52,520 --> 04:47:53,188
FORD, I FEEL SORRY FOR HER AND I

2273
04:47:53,188 --> 04:47:53,855
DO BELIEVE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO

2274
04:47:53,855 --> 04:47:54,456
HER AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN AND

2275
04:47:54,456 --> 04:47:55,056
WHERE, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT

2276
04:47:55,056 --> 04:47:55,657
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH AND AS A

2277
04:47:55,657 --> 04:47:56,324
PROSECUTOR, YOU COULDN'T GET OUT

2278
04:47:56,324 --> 04:47:56,958
OF THE BATTER'S BOX BECAUSE IN

2279
04:47:56,958 --> 04:47:57,592
AMERICA, BEFORE YOU CAN ACCUSE

2280
04:47:57,592 --> 04:47:58,260
SOMEBODY OF A CRIME YOU HAVE TO

2281
04:47:58,260 --> 04:47:58,927
TELL THEM WHEN IT HAPPENED AND

2282
04:47:58,927 --> 04:47:59,561
WHERE IT HAPPENED AND YOU HAVE

2283
04:47:59,561 --> 04:48:00,161
TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE

2284
04:48:00,161 --> 04:48:00,629
DOUBT IT DID HAPPEN.

2285
04:48:00,629 --> 04:48:01,329
THE REASON THIS CASE WILL NEVER

2286
04:48:01,329 --> 04:48:01,897
BE BROUGHT IN MARYLAND OR

2287
04:48:01,897 --> 04:48:02,497
ANYWHERE ELSE, YOU JUST CAN'T

2288
04:48:02,497 --> 04:48:02,797
GET THERE.

2289
04:48:02,797 --> 04:48:03,431
IF YOU WANTED TO GET A WARRANT,

2290
04:48:03,431 --> 04:48:03,999
WHICH IS A PROXIMATE CAUSE

2291
04:48:03,999 --> 04:48:04,633
STANDARD TO SEARCH OR ARREST

2292
04:48:04,633 --> 04:48:05,200
SOMEONE -- PROBABLY CAUSE,

2293
04:48:05,200 --> 04:48:05,867
YOU -- PROBALBLE CAUSE WHERE AND

2294
04:48:05,867 --> 04:48:06,268
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

2295
04:48:06,268 --> 04:48:06,935
AT THIS TIME BURDEN ON YOU TO

2296
04:48:06,935 --> 04:48:07,569
PROVE YOU WERE NOT AT A PARTY

2297
04:48:07,569 --> 04:48:08,203
35 YEARS AGO AND WON'T TELL YOU

2298
04:48:08,203 --> 04:48:08,737
WHERE OR WHEN IT WAS?

2299
04:48:08,737 --> 04:48:09,337
SO ALL THE I CAN SAY IS UNDER

2300
04:48:09,337 --> 04:48:09,938
ANY REASONABLE STANDARD, ANY

2301
04:48:09,938 --> 04:48:10,639
CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THIS

2302
04:48:10,639 --> 04:48:11,139
WOULD NOT GO FORWARD.

2303
04:48:11,139 --> 04:48:11,840
THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE ALLEGATIONS

2304
04:48:11,840 --> 04:48:12,040
HERE.

2305
04:48:12,040 --> 04:48:12,707
THE FIFTH ALLEGATION WAS BROUGHT

2306
04:48:12,707 --> 04:48:13,375
TO ME BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE WHO

2307
04:48:13,375 --> 04:48:14,042
DID ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING.

2308
04:48:14,042 --> 04:48:14,676
SOMEBODY CONTACTED HIM IN RHODE

2309
04:48:14,676 --> 04:48:15,343
ISLAND AND SAID, A FRIEND OF HIS

2310
04:48:15,343 --> 04:48:16,011
WAS ON A BOAT WITH MARK JUDGE

2311
04:48:16,011 --> 04:48:16,645
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH AND TREATED

2312
04:48:16,645 --> 04:48:17,012
HER BAT BODILY.

2313
04:48:17,012 --> 04:48:17,712
HE WENT DOWN AND BEAT HIM UP AND

2314
04:48:17,712 --> 04:48:18,246
SHE WON'T COME FORWARD.

2315
04:48:18,246 --> 04:48:18,980
I SAID I'LL MAKE SURE, I'LL JOIN

2316
04:48:18,980 --> 04:48:19,614
WITH YOU, LET THE FBI LOOK AT

2317
04:48:19,614 --> 04:48:20,248
IT, AND TURNED OUT NOT TO BE

2318
04:48:20,248 --> 04:48:20,448
TRUE.

2319
04:48:20,448 --> 04:48:21,049
THE FOURTH ALLEGATION WAS AN

2320
04:48:21,049 --> 04:48:21,683
ANONYMOUS ALLEGATION, ALERT ARE

2321
04:48:21,683 --> 04:48:22,384
WITHOUT A DATE OR RETURN ADDRESS

2322
04:48:22,384 --> 04:48:23,051
SENT TO CORY GARDNER JUST A FEW

2323
04:48:23,051 --> 04:48:23,718
DAYS AGO AND HE TURNED IT OVER

2324
04:48:23,718 --> 04:48:24,319
TO THE COMMITTEE AND SOMEBODY

2325
04:48:24,319 --> 04:48:24,953
LEAK TODAY TO NBC NEWS AND IT

2326
04:48:24,953 --> 04:48:25,654
MADE IT ON THE -- LEAKED IT ON

2327
04:48:25,654 --> 04:48:26,288
THE NEWS AND MADE IT ON THE

2328
04:48:26,288 --> 04:48:26,888
NEWS, THE FOURTH ALLEGATION.

2329
04:48:26,888 --> 04:48:27,389
THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME.

2330
04:48:27,389 --> 04:48:28,023
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

2331
04:48:28,023 --> 04:48:28,690
OVER THERE BUT THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

2332
04:48:28,690 --> 04:48:29,291
IT WAS SOMEBODY OVER THERE.

2333
04:48:29,291 --> 04:48:29,991
NOW ABOUT MS. FORD I FEEL REALLY

2334
04:48:29,991 --> 04:48:30,558
BAD SHE WANTED TO REMAIN

2335
04:48:30,558 --> 04:48:31,092
ANONYMOUS AND COULD NOT.

2336
04:48:31,092 --> 04:48:31,793
THE ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE IS

2337
04:48:31,793 --> 04:48:32,394
DIANNE FEINSTEIN WOULD NOT DO

2338
04:48:32,394 --> 04:48:32,928
THIS AND DID NOT DO THIS.

2339
04:48:32,928 --> 04:48:33,595
I KNOW FOR SURE SOMEBODY DID.

2340
04:48:33,595 --> 04:48:34,262
IT WASN'T SHATTER FROM A FRIEND.

2341
04:48:34,262 --> 04:48:34,863
THREE GROUPS HAD THIS LETTER

2342
04:48:34,863 --> 04:48:35,397
THAT WAS REQUESTED TO BE

2343
04:48:35,397 --> 04:48:35,664
ANONYMOUS.

2344
04:48:35,664 --> 04:48:36,298
DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND HER STAFF,

2345
04:48:36,298 --> 04:48:36,798

CALIFORNIA AND HER STAFF, AND

2347
04:48:37,399 --> 04:48:37,732
THE LAWYERS.

2348
04:48:37,732 --> 04:48:38,400
SOMEBODY BETRAYED HER TRUST, AND

2349
04:48:38,400 --> 04:48:39,034
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY YOU

2350
04:48:39,034 --> 04:48:39,534
SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING.

2351
04:48:39,534 --> 04:48:40,235
TO DELAY THIS HEARING, TO SET IN

2352
04:48:40,235 --> 04:48:40,869

04:48:41,937 --> 04:48:42,537
THAT I KNOW BEYOND ANY, ANY

2356
04:48:42,537 --> 04:48:42,737
DOUBT.

2357
04:48:42,737 --> 04:48:43,204
WHAT ELSE DO I KNOW?

2358
04:48:43,204 --> 04:48:43,905

DIDN'T KNOW YOU WOULD BE WILLING

2361
04:48:45,140 --> 04:48:45,473
TO COME TO ME.

2362
04:48:45,473 --> 04:48:46,107
THE E-MAIL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN

2363
04:48:46,107 --> 04:48:46,741
THIS COMMITTEE AND HER LAWYERS,

2364
04:48:46,741 --> 04:48:47,375
MY STAFF WOULD STILL WELCOME THE

2365
04:48:47,375 --> 04:48:48,009

COME TO US OR WE TO YOU AND I'M

2369
04:48:49,678 --> 04:48:50,378
WILLING TO HAVE MY STAFF TRAVEL

2370
04:48:50,378 --> 04:48:50,979
TO DR. FORD IN CALIFORNIA OR

2371
04:48:50,979 --> 04:48:51,579
ANYWHERE ELSE TO OBTAIN HER

2372
04:48:51,579 --> 04:48:52,113
TESTIMONY SEPTEMBER 19th.

2373
04:48:52,113 --> 04:48:52,781
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T FIT IN THE

2374
04:48:52,781 --> 04:48:52,981
PLAN.

2375
04:48:52,981 --> 04:48:53,615
IT WOULDN'T BE PUBLIC, AND IT

2376
04:48:53,615 --> 04:48:54,282
WOULD GET OVER WITH SOONER THAN

2377
04:48:54,282 --> 04:48:54,616
PEOPLE WANTED.

2378
04:48:54,616 --> 04:48:55,283
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE BUT

2379
04:48:55,283 --> 04:48:55,984
I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT DR. FORD

2380
04:48:55,984 --> 04:48:56,518
DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS

2381
04:48:56,518 --> 04:48:56,818
INVITATION.

2382
04:48:56,818 --> 04:48:57,485
AND I'VE BEEN A LAWYER MOST OF

2383
04:48:57,485 --> 04:48:58,153
MY ADULT LIFE AND SOMEBODY NEEDS

2384
04:48:58,153 --> 04:48:58,720
TO ASK THE QUESTION, TO HER

2385
04:48:58,720 --> 04:48:59,354
LAWYERS, HOW COULD SHE NOT KNOW

2386
04:48:59,354 --> 04:48:59,654
ABOUT THIS.

2387
04:48:59,654 --> 04:49:00,322
ARE YOU BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND

2388
04:49:00,322 --> 04:49:00,989
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A VERY

2389
04:49:00,989 --> 04:49:01,690
LONG TIME IN THIS CASE, IT'S NOT

2390
04:49:01,690 --> 04:49:02,257
THAT HARD TO FIGURE OUT.

2391
04:49:02,257 --> 04:49:02,924
SO IF THIS IS THE NEW STANDARD,

2392
04:49:02,924 --> 04:49:03,625
THE ACCUSATION PROVES ITSELF TO

2393
04:49:03,625 --> 04:49:04,326
THOSE WHO WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS,

2394
04:49:04,326 --> 04:49:05,060
YOU HATE WOMEN, GOT HELP US ALL.

2395
04:49:05,060 --> 04:49:05,627
IF THE NEW STANDARD FOR THE

2396
04:49:05,627 --> 04:49:06,194
COMMITTEE, IS THERE IS NO

2397
04:49:06,194 --> 04:49:06,828
PRESUMPTION OF ANYTHING, THAT

2398
04:49:06,828 --> 04:49:07,495
YOU HAVE TO PROVE WHY SOMEBODY

2399
04:49:07,495 --> 04:49:08,163
<u>OULD ACCUSE YOU, NOI</u>

2400
04:49:08,163 --> 04:49:08,797
DIDN'T DO IT AND HERE'S WHY I

2401
04:49:08,797 --> 04:49:09,431
DIDN'T DO IT BUT YOU HAVE TO

2402
04:49:09,431 --> 04:49:09,998
PROVE THE MOTIVES OF YOUR

2403
04:49:09,998 --> 04:49:10,231
ACCUSER.

2404
04:49:10,231 --> 04:49:10,632
GOD HELP US ALL.

2405
04:49:10,632 --> 04:49:11,232
THE MICHAEL AVENATTI MOMENT,

2406
04:49:11,232 --> 04:49:11,933
TELLS YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

2407
04:49:11,933 --> 04:49:12,567
IF WE KEEP THIS FORCE GOING.

2408
04:49:12,567 --> 04:49:13,134
PLENTY OF TIME, PLENTY OF

2409
04:49:13,134 --> 04:49:13,735
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET TO THE

2410
04:49:13,735 --> 04:49:13,935
TRUTH.

2411
04:49:13,935 --> 04:49:14,536
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE

2412
04:49:14,536 --> 04:49:14,736
TRUTH.

2413
04:49:14,736 --> 04:49:15,337
THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT DELAY AND

2414
04:49:15,337 --> 04:49:15,937
DESTRUCTION, AND IF WE REWARD

2415
04:49:15,937 --> 04:49:16,571
THIS, IT IS THE END OF GOOD

2416
04:49:16,571 --> 04:49:17,238
PEOPLE WANTING TO BE JUDGES, IT

2417
04:49:17,238 --> 04:49:17,772
IS THE END OF WANTING ANY

2418
04:49:17,772 --> 04:49:18,406
CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW.

2419
04:49:18,406 --> 04:49:19,040
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS

2420
04:49:19,040 --> 04:49:19,641
THAT WILL TEAR THIS COUNTRY

2421
04:49:19,641 --> 04:49:19,841
APART.

2422
04:49:19,841 --> 04:49:20,542
AND IF I AM CHAIRMAN, NEXT YEAR,

2423
04:49:20,542 --> 04:49:21,142
IF WE KEEP THE MAJORITY AND

2424
04:49:21,142 --> 04:49:21,810
SENATOR GRASSLEY MOVES OVER, AND

2425
04:49:21,810 --> 04:49:22,410
I HOPE HE DOESN'T BECAUSE I

2426
04:49:22,410 --> 04:49:23,044
THINK HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB.

2427
04:49:23,044 --> 04:49:23,645
I'M GOING TO REMEMBER THIS.

2428
04:49:23,645 --> 04:49:24,212
THERE IS THE PROCESS BEFORE

2429
04:49:24,212 --> 04:49:24,846
KAVANAUGH AND THE PROCESS AFTER

2430
04:49:24,846 --> 04:49:25,113
KAVANAUGH.

2431
04:49:25,113 --> 04:49:25,780
IF YOU WANT TO VET THE NOMINEE,

2432
04:49:25,780 --> 04:49:26,047
YOU CAN.

2433
04:49:26,047 --> 04:49:26,715
IF YOU WANT TO DELAY THINGS FOR

2434
04:49:26,715 --> 04:49:27,415
THE NEXT ELECTION, YOU WILL NOT.

2435
04:49:27,415 --> 04:49:28,049
IF YOU TRY TO DESTROY SOMEBODY

2436
04:49:28,049 --> 04:49:28,717
YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH IT.

2437
04:49:28,717 --> 04:49:29,117
JEFF IS LEAVING.

2438
04:49:29,117 --> 04:49:29,684
HE HAS WRESTLED WITH THIS.

2439
04:49:29,684 --> 04:49:30,218
HE'S TRYING TO BE FAIR.

2440
04:49:30,218 --> 04:49:30,852
I CANNOT TELL YOU, JEFF, WHAT

2441
04:49:30,852 --> 04:49:31,353
HAPPENED 35 YEARS AGO.

2442
04:49:31,353 --> 04:49:31,920
I CAN TELL YOU THIS, THAT

2443
04:49:31,920 --> 04:49:32,554
THROUGH ANY LEGAL SYSTEM, THIS

2444
04:49:32,554 --> 04:49:33,188
THING WOULD NOT GET OUT OF THE

2445
04:49:33,188 --> 04:49:33,855
BATTER'S BOX AND THAT EVERYTHING

2446
04:49:33,855 --> 04:49:34,456
I KNOW ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH

2447
04:49:34,456 --> 04:49:35,156
SCREAMS THAT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN.

2448
04:49:35,156 --> 04:49:35,824
AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS SO

2449
04:49:35,824 --> 04:49:36,458
TO MY GOOD FRIEND, FRIENDS ON

2450
04:49:36,458 --> 04:49:36,958
THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE

2451
04:49:36,958 --> 04:49:37,525
STRUGGLING, I THINK AN FBI

2452
04:49:37,525 --> 04:49:38,159
INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO DO

2453
04:49:38,159 --> 04:49:38,393
NOTHING.

2454
04:49:38,393 --> 04:49:39,094
IT'S NOT GOING TO TELL KNEW MORE

2455
04:49:39,094 --> 04:49:39,527
THAN WE KNOW NOW.

2456
04:49:39,527 --> 04:49:40,128
IT'S GOING TO JUST KEEP IT

2457
04:49:40,128 --> 04:49:40,695
GOING, AND GOING, AND GOING

2458
04:49:40,695 --> 04:49:41,363
UNTIL HE BREAKS UNTIL THE NEXT

2459
04:49:41,363 --> 04:49:41,796
FIVE COME FORWARD.

2460
04:49:41,796 --> 04:49:42,330
I'M GOING TO VOTE YES.

2461
04:49:42,330 --> 04:49:42,931
AND I'M GOING TO TELL HIS TWO

2462
04:49:42,931 --> 04:49:43,631
DAUGHTERS THAT I'M PROUD OF YOUR

2463
04:49:43,631 --> 04:49:44,966
DAD AND I REALLY, REALLY BELIEVO

2464
04:49:44,966 --> 04:49:45,600
TELL DR. FORD I'M SORRY YOU HAD

2465
04:49:45,600 --> 04:49:46,167
TO GO THROUGH THIS, TOO.

2466
04:49:46,234 --> 04:49:46,634
>> SENATOR DURBIN.

2467
04:49:46,634 --> 04:49:47,202
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

2468
04:49:47,202 --> 04:49:47,836
THURSDAY WAS A HISTORIC DAY IN

2469
04:49:47,836 --> 04:49:48,536
THE SENATE COMMIT WE MORE THAN

2470
04:49:48,536 --> 04:49:49,237
ITS FAIR SHARE OF HISTORY AND IN

2471
04:49:49,237 --> 04:49:49,804
OUR DELIBERATIONS OVER THE

2472
04:49:49,804 --> 04:49:50,472
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH WE

2473
04:49:50,472 --> 04:49:51,172
HAVE CONFRONTED SOME OF THE MOST

2474
04:49:51,172 --> 04:49:51,773
SERIOUS CHARGES EVER LEVELED

2475
04:49:51,773 --> 04:49:52,207
AGAINST A NOMINEE.

2476
04:49:52,207 --> 04:49:52,841
THOSE CHARGES WERE MADE AT A

2477
04:49:52,841 --> 04:49:53,475
MOMENT IN THE NATION'S HISTORY

2478
04:49:53,475 --> 04:49:54,075
WHEN WE WERE LIVING THROUGH

2479
04:49:54,075 --> 04:49:54,509
CULTURAL REVOLUTION.

2480
04:49:54,509 --> 04:49:55,143
WOMEN IN AMERICA ARE NOT ONLY

2481
04:49:55,143 --> 04:49:55,744
EMERGING INTO MORE AND MORE

2482
04:49:55,744 --> 04:49:56,344
POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY,

2483
04:49:56,344 --> 04:49:56,978
THEY ARE NOW AIRING GRIEVANCES

2484
04:49:56,978 --> 04:49:57,645
OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ABUSE

2485
04:49:57,645 --> 04:49:58,213
AT EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY,

2486
04:49:58,213 --> 04:49:58,847
CAUGHT IN THE VORTEX OF THIS

2487
04:49:58,847 --> 04:49:59,481
CULTURAL SHIFT, THERE IS NOT A

2488
04:49:59,481 --> 04:50:00,081
PERSON IN THIS ROOM WHO CAN

2489
04:50:00,081 --> 04:50:00,749
TRULY MEASURE THE TRAJECTORY OR

2490
04:50:00,749 --> 04:50:01,282
ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS

2491
04:50:01,282 --> 04:50:01,649
HISTORIC CHANGE.

2492
04:50:01,649 --> 04:50:02,317
AMERICA IS MARCHING FORWARD IN

2493
04:50:02,317 --> 04:50:02,984
THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE FOR WOMEN

2494
04:50:02,984 --> 04:50:03,385
IN THIS COUNTRY.

2495
04:50:03,385 --> 04:50:03,952
SADLY, MANY ON THE SENATE

2496
04:50:03,952 --> 04:50:04,552
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ARE STILL

2497
04:50:04,552 --> 04:50:05,186
MIRED IN THE DEAD SPACE IT WAS

2498
04:50:05,186 --> 04:50:05,854
27 YEARS AGO DURING THE CLARENCE

2499
04:50:05,854 --> 04:50:06,221
THOMAS HEARING.

2500
04:50:06,221 --> 04:50:06,888
YESTERDAY IN THIS ROOM, AMERICA

2501
04:50:06,888 --> 04:50:07,555
SAW THIS INFLAMMATORY ISSUE IN

2502
04:50:07,555 --> 04:50:08,089
REAL TIME IN REAL LIFE.

2503
04:50:08,089 --> 04:50:08,723
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS

2504
04:50:08,723 --> 04:50:09,290
CREDIBLE, COOPERATIVE, AND

2505
04:50:09,290 --> 04:50:09,557
RESOLUTE.

2506
04:50:09,557 --> 04:50:10,191
WHEN I ASKED HER DIRECTLY UNDER

2507
04:50:10,191 --> 04:50:10,725
OATH, THE DEGREE OF THE

2508
04:50:10,725 --> 04:50:11,359
CERTAINTY THAT SHE HAD SHE WAS

2509
04:50:11,359 --> 04:50:11,993
ASSAULTED BY BRETT KAVANAUGH,

2510
04:50:11,993 --> 04:50:12,627
SHE RESPONDED "100%", WHEN THE

2511
04:50:12,627 --> 04:50:13,228
PROSECUTOR ON THE REPUBLICAN

2512
04:50:13,228 --> 04:50:13,828
SIDE TRY TO WAVE A POLITICAL

2513
04:50:13,828 --> 04:50:14,496
CONSPIRACY, OR MAKE HER A TOOL

2514
04:50:14,496 --> 04:50:15,030
OVER LIARS, IT FELL FLAT.

2515
04:50:15,030 --> 04:50:15,663
THIS WOMAN WHO IDENTIFIED BRETT

2516
04:50:15,663 --> 04:50:16,297
KAVANAUGH AS HER ASSAILANT TO

2517
04:50:16,297 --> 04:50:16,898
HER HUSBAND AND THERAPIST SIX

2518
04:50:16,898 --> 04:50:17,499
YEARS AGO BELIEVED SHE HAD A

2519
04:50:17,499 --> 04:50:18,133
RESPONSIBILITY AS A CITIZEN --

2520
04:50:18,133 --> 04:50:18,800
AS A CITIZEN TO COME FORWARD AND

2521
04:50:18,800 --> 04:50:19,167
TELL HER STORY.

2522
04:50:19,167 --> 04:50:19,768
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE WORDS SHE

2523
04:50:19,768 --> 04:50:20,402
USED DURING THE COURSE OF HER

2524
04:50:20,402 --> 04:50:21,036
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY, THE WORD

2525
04:50:21,036 --> 04:50:21,736
SHE USED MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WAS

2526
04:50:21,736 --> 04:50:22,003
"HELPFUL."

2527
04:50:22,003 --> 04:50:22,704
SHE WANTED TO BE HELPFUL TO THIS

2528
04:50:22,704 --> 04:50:22,837
IN

2529
04:50:22,837 --> 04:50:23,171
COMMITTEE AND.

2530
04:50:23,171 --> 04:50:23,538
I BELIEVE HER.

2531
04:50:23,538 --> 04:50:24,172
SHE WAS AFRAID FOR HER FAMILY

2532
04:50:24,172 --> 04:50:24,839
AND CONFIDED IN HER COLLEAGUE,

2533
04:50:24,839 --> 04:50:25,507
DIANNE FEINSTEIN, WITH THE CLEAR

2534
04:50:25,507 --> 04:50:26,141
UNDERSTANDING I DID KNOW WOULD

2535
04:50:26,141 --> 04:50:26,808
PROTECT HER IDENTITY AND I HAVE

2536
04:50:26,808 --> 04:50:27,409
NO DOUBT THAT DIANE ACCEPTED

2537
04:50:27,409 --> 04:50:28,076
THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND KEPT HER

2538
04:50:28,076 --> 04:50:28,276
WORD.

2539
04:50:28,276 --> 04:50:28,910
YESTERDAY TWO MEMBERS OF THIS

2540
04:50:28,910 --> 04:50:29,544
COMMIT LEVELED PERSONAL ATTACKS

2541
04:50:29,544 --> 04:50:30,145
AT SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND SAID

2542
04:50:30,145 --> 04:50:30,745
SHE CONCEALED HER LETTER FOR

2543
04:50:30,745 --> 04:50:31,413
PARTISAN REASONS AND ONE WENT SO

2544
04:50:31,413 --> 04:50:31,980
FAR TO SAY SHE LEAKED THE

2545
04:50:31,980 --> 04:50:32,614
CONTENTS OF THAT LETTER OR HER

2546
04:50:32,614 --> 04:50:33,081
STAFF TO THE PRESS.

2547
04:50:33,081 --> 04:50:33,715
PERHAPS IN THIS TRUMPIAN ERA,

2548
04:50:33,715 --> 04:50:34,249
THOSE SOUTH CAROLINAS OF

2549
04:50:34,249 --> 04:50:34,816
BASELESS CHARGES ARE TO BE

2550
04:50:34,816 --> 04:50:35,450
EXACTED BUT IF WE DESCEND TO

2551
04:50:35,450 --> 04:50:35,950
THIS LEVEL OF POLITICAL

2552
04:50:35,950 --> 04:50:36,618
DISCOURSE WE HAVE FORSAKEN THE

2553
04:50:36,618 --> 04:50:37,218
TRADITIONS OF SENATE AND THE

2554
04:50:37,218 --> 04:50:37,852
COMEDY, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO

2555
04:50:37,852 --> 04:50:38,453
OUR PUBLIC SERVICE AND FOR THE

2556
04:50:38,453 --> 04:50:39,087
RECORD, THIS BASELESS CLAIM WAS

2557
04:50:39,087 --> 04:50:39,654
REFUTED IMMEDIATELY BY THE

2558
04:50:39,654 --> 04:50:40,255
INTERSEPT, WHICH WAS FIRST TO

2559
04:50:40,255 --> 04:50:41,222
PUBLISH THE STORY ABOUT DR.úFOR.

2560
04:50:41,222 --> 04:50:41,890
THEIR REPORTER SAID LAST NIGHT

2561
04:50:41,890 --> 04:50:42,524
AND I QUOTE, FEINSTEIN'S STAFF

2562
04:50:42,524 --> 04:50:43,191
DID NOT LEAK THE LETTER TO THE

2563
04:50:43,191 --> 04:50:43,458
INTERSEPT.

2564
04:50:43,458 --> 04:50:44,059
YESTERDAY, DR. FORD MADE THE

2565
04:50:44,059 --> 04:50:44,692
PENALTY DECISION TO TELL HER

2566
04:50:44,692 --> 04:50:45,060
STORY PUBLICLY.

2567
04:50:45,060 --> 04:50:45,693
SHE CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

2568
04:50:45,693 --> 04:50:46,294
UNDERNEATH AND VOLUNTEERED TO

2569
04:50:46,294 --> 04:50:46,761
ANSWER EVERY QUESTION.

2570
04:50:46,761 --> 04:50:47,429
NONE OF THE REPUBLICANS ON THIS

2571
04:50:47,429 --> 04:50:47,996
COMMITTEE WERE WILLING TO

2572
04:50:47,996 --> 04:50:48,630
QUESTION OR CONFRONT HER, NOT

2573
04:50:48,630 --> 04:50:48,797
ONE.

2574
04:50:48,797 --> 04:50:49,297
THEY SAT SILENT AS THEIR

2575
04:50:49,297 --> 04:50:49,964
PROSECUTOR MS. MITCHELL TRIED TO

2576
04:50:49,964 --> 04:50:50,265
DO THE WORK.

2577
04:50:50,265 --> 04:50:50,899
IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY, LAST

2578
04:50:50,899 --> 04:50:51,566
NIGHT ON A TV SHOW ONE SENATOR

2579
04:50:51,566 --> 04:50:52,200
SAID AND I QUOTE, MS. FORD HAS

2580
04:50:52,200 --> 04:50:52,834
GOT A PROBLEM, AND DESTROYING

2581
04:50:52,834 --> 04:50:53,501
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S LIFE WON'T FIX

2582
04:50:53,501 --> 04:50:53,835
HER PROBLEM.

2583
04:50:53,835 --> 04:50:54,436
HOW COULD YOU LISTEN TO HER

2584
04:50:54,436 --> 04:50:55,070
HONEST AND DIRECT TEST TIMONY.

2585
04:50:55,070 --> 04:50:55,703
LOOKING AT HIS FRIENDS TO GAYER

2586
04:50:55,703 --> 04:50:56,337
AND SUPPORT HIM, ONE COULD NOT

2587
04:50:56,337 --> 04:50:56,971
HELP BUT FEEL AS OUR COLLEAGUE

2588
04:50:56,971 --> 04:50:57,472
SENATE THE SENATOR FLAKE

2589
04:50:57,472 --> 04:50:58,073
REMINDED US IS THIS IS DEEPLY

2590
04:50:58,073 --> 04:50:58,706
PERSONAL AND THERE IS MANNER TO

2591
04:50:58,706 --> 04:50:59,374
RECONCILE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

2592
04:50:59,374 --> 04:50:59,607
LEDGER.

2593
04:50:59,607 --> 04:51:00,241
I CAN FEEL THE INTENSITY OVER

2594
04:51:00,241 --> 04:51:00,909
WHAT HE'S EXPERIENCED DURING THE

2595
04:51:00,909 --> 04:51:01,509
LAST FEW WEEKS BUT I COULD NOT

2596
04:51:01,509 --> 04:51:02,110
UNDERSTAND HOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH

2597
04:51:02,110 --> 04:51:02,777
COULD SAY THAT HE QUOTE NO NO

2598
04:51:02,777 --> 04:51:03,411
ILL WILL TOWARDS DR. FORD AND

2599
04:51:03,411 --> 04:51:04,045
CALLED HER CHARGES A CALCULATED,

2600
04:51:04,045 --> 04:51:04,612
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT,

2601
04:51:04,612 --> 04:51:05,246
CITING APPARENT PENT UP ANGER

2602
04:51:05,246 --> 04:51:05,847

QUOTE REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE

2604
04:51:06,481 --> 04:51:06,748
CLINTONS.

2605
04:51:06,748 --> 04:51:07,315
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE

2606
04:51:07,315 --> 04:51:07,582
CLINTONS.

2607
04:51:07,582 --> 04:51:08,249
THIS LOCK HER UP GRACE NOTE IN

2608
04:51:08,249 --> 04:51:08,850
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S REMARKS MAY

2609
04:51:08,850 --> 04:51:09,551
HAVE RAISED A CHEER IT UP MOMENT

2610
04:51:09,551 --> 04:51:09,984
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

2611
04:51:09,984 --> 04:51:10,685
THE EXCHANGE I HAD WAS AN HONEST

2612
04:51:10,685 --> 04:51:11,286
EFFORT TO LOOSE THE GOURDIAN

2613
04:51:11,286 --> 04:51:11,920
KNOT THIS COMMITTEE FACES WHEN

2614
04:51:11,920 --> 04:51:12,487
TWO SWORN WITNESSES ARE IN

2615
04:51:12,487 --> 04:51:12,754
CONDITION.

2616
04:51:12,754 --> 04:51:13,455
WHAT I ASKED FOR, WHAT MANY HAVE

2617
04:51:13,455 --> 04:51:13,988
ASKED FOR, IS OBVIOUS.

2618
04:51:13,988 --> 04:51:14,689
TURN OVER THE FAX THE WE KNOW TO

2619
04:51:14,689 --> 04:51:15,190
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF

2620
04:51:15,190 --> 04:51:15,523
INVESTIGATION.

2621
04:51:15,523 --> 04:51:16,124
LET THEM CONNECT THE DOTS, LET

2622
04:51:16,124 --> 04:51:16,791
THEM COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION,

2623
04:51:16,791 --> 04:51:17,392
THEN LET US MEET AND EVALUATE

2624
04:51:17,392 --> 04:51:17,759
THEIR FINDINGS.

2625
04:51:17,759 --> 04:51:18,326
DO YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY?

2626
04:51:18,326 --> 04:51:18,827
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE

2627
04:51:18,827 --> 04:51:19,427
REPUBLICANS MADE A POINT OF

2628
04:51:19,427 --> 04:51:19,961
QUOTING THE AMERICAN BAR

2629
04:51:19,961 --> 04:51:20,261
ASSOCIATION?

2630
04:51:20,261 --> 04:51:20,829
MR. CHAIRMAN, I WOULD LIKE

2631
04:51:20,829 --> 04:51:21,429
PERMISSION TO ENTER INTO THE

2632
04:51:21,429 --> 04:51:22,030
RECORD A LETTER FROM SENT TO

2633
04:51:22,030 --> 04:51:22,597
THIS COMMITTEE ON SEPTEMBER

27th, 2018 BY THE AMERICAN BAR

2635
04:51:23,231 --> 04:51:23,565
ASSOCIATION.

2636
04:51:23,631 --> 04:51:24,232
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION, LET ME

2637
04:51:24,232 --> 04:51:24,499
READ IT.

2638
04:51:24,566 --> 04:51:25,166
>> AS APPROPRIATE, THE FULL

2639
04:51:25,166 --> 04:51:25,633
SENATE WILL CONDUCT A

2640
04:51:25,633 --> 04:51:26,201
CONFIRMATION VOTE ON JUDGE

2641
04:51:26,201 --> 04:51:26,801
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION ONLY

2642
04:51:26,801 --> 04:51:27,435
AFTER AN APPROPRIATE BACKGROUND

2643
04:51:27,435 --> 04:51:28,136
CHECK IN THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY

2644
04:51:28,136 --> 04:51:28,770
PROFESSOR FORD AND OTHERS IS

2645
04:51:28,770 --> 04:51:29,437
COMPLETED BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU

2646
04:51:29,437 --> 04:51:29,804
OF INVESTGATION.

2647
04:51:29,804 --> 04:51:30,472
WE MAKE THIS REQUEST BECAUSE OF

2648
04:51:30,472 --> 04:51:31,106
THE ABA'S RESPECT FOR THE RULE

2649
04:51:31,106 --> 04:51:31,673
OF LAW AND DUE PROCESS UNDER

2650
04:51:31,673 --> 04:51:31,840
LAW.

2651
04:51:31,840 --> 04:51:32,407
THE BASIC PRINCIPALS THAT

2652
04:51:32,407 --> 04:51:32,907
UNDERSCORE THE SENATE'S

2653
04:51:32,907 --> 04:51:33,541
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY AND CONSENT

2654
04:51:33,541 --> 04:51:34,075
ON FEDERAL JOOULD IGDSIAL

2655
04:51:34,075 --> 04:51:34,509
JUDICIAL NOMINATION

2656
04:51:34,509 --> 04:51:35,176
REQUIRE NOTHING BUT THE FACTS BY

2657
04:51:35,176 --> 04:51:35,443
THE FBI.

2658
04:51:35,443 --> 04:51:36,111
AS WITH ALL OTHERS, IT'S SIMPLY

2659
04:51:36,111 --> 04:51:36,811
TOO IMPORTANT TO RUSH TO A VOTE.

2660
04:51:36,811 --> 04:51:37,378
DECIDING TO PROCEED WITHOUT

2661
04:51:37,378 --> 04:51:37,846
CONDUCTING ADDITIONAL

2662
04:51:37,846 --> 04:51:38,446
INVESTIGATION WOULD NOT ONLY

2663
04:51:38,446 --> 04:51:39,013
HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON THE

2664
04:51:39,013 --> 04:51:39,681
SENATE'S REPUTATION, BUT IT WILL

2665
04:51:39,681 --> 04:51:40,348
ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE GREAT

2666
04:51:40,348 --> 04:51:41,015
TRUST NECESSARY FOR THE AMERICAN

2667
04:51:41,015 --> 04:51:41,649
PEOPLE TO HAVE IN THE SUPREME

2668
04:51:41,649 --> 04:51:41,850
COURT.

2669
04:51:41,850 --> 04:51:42,517
IT MUST REMAIN AN CONSTITUTION

2670
04:51:42,517 --> 04:51:43,184
THAT'LL RELIABLY FOLLOW THE LAW

2671
04:51:43,184 --> 04:51:43,585
AND NOT POLITICS.

2672
04:51:43,585 --> 04:51:44,252
RESPECTFULLY, THE SENATE SHOULD

2673
04:51:44,252 --> 04:51:44,886
RECOGNIZE THAT A THUGT ROW FBI

2674
04:51:44,886 --> 04:51:45,520
INVESTIGATION WILL DEMONSTRATE

2675
04:51:45,520 --> 04:51:46,121
ITS COMMITMENT TO A SUPREME

2676
04:51:46,121 --> 04:51:46,754
COURT THAT IS ABOVE REPROACH.

2677
04:51:46,754 --> 04:51:47,455
THAT LETTER WAS SIGNED BY ROBERT

2678
04:51:47,455 --> 04:51:47,989
CARLSON, PRESIDENT OF THE

2679
04:51:47,989 --> 04:51:48,523
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.

2680
04:51:48,523 --> 04:51:49,190
ALL OF THE QUOTES YES ABOUT THE

2681
04:51:49,190 --> 04:51:49,858
ABA'S FINDING ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH

2682
04:51:49,858 --> 04:51:50,492
ARE A DISTANT SECOND TO WHAT

2683
04:51:50,492 --> 04:51:51,192
WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE SAME ORG

2684
04:51:51,192 --> 04:51:51,860
ZAGDS TO DO AND IT IS NOT AN

2685
04:51:51,860 --> 04:51:52,327
UNREASONABLE REQUEST.

2686
04:51:52,327 --> 04:51:52,894
WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH?

2687
04:51:52,894 --> 04:51:53,528
TWO SWORN WITNESSES IN DIRECT

2688
04:51:53,528 --> 04:51:54,162
CONTRADICTION, BUT THERE IS ONE

2689
04:51:54,162 --> 04:51:54,429
CONTDIGDS.

2690
04:51:54,429 --> 04:51:55,063
ONE OF THESE SWORN WITNESSES HAS

2691
04:51:55,063 --> 04:51:55,730
STEPPED FORWARD AND SAID I WOULD

2692
04:51:55,730 --> 04:51:56,397
SUBMIT MY TEST SKBRN I MONY AND

2693
04:51:56,397 --> 04:51:57,065

INVESTIGATION, UNDERSTANDING

2695
04:51:57,632 --> 04:51:58,266
ANYONE WHO DIES TO THE FEDERAL

2696
04:51:58,266 --> 04:51:58,900
BUREAU IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL

2697
04:51:58,900 --> 04:51:59,200
PROSECUTION.

2698
04:51:59,200 --> 04:51:59,834
THE OTHER WITNESS EVADED THAT

2699
04:51:59,834 --> 04:52:00,502
QUESTION OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

2700
04:52:00,502 --> 04:52:01,102
OH, I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO THE

2701
04:52:01,102 --> 04:52:01,636
COMMITTEE, IT'S UP TO THE

DECISION.

2705
04:52:03,271 --> 04:52:03,872
JUDGE KAVANAUGH KNOWS BETTER.

2706
04:52:03,872 --> 04:52:04,439
HE KNOWS IF HE HAD TURNED

2707
04:52:04,439 --> 04:52:05,039
YESTERDAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE

2708
04:52:05,039 --> 04:52:05,673
COUNSEL AND SAID SUSPEND THIS

2709
04:52:05,673 --> 04:52:06,174

04:52:06,174 --> 04:52:06,841
INVESTIGATION TO CLEAR MY NAME,

04:52:06,841 --> 04:52:07,375
MY REPRESENTATION AND MY

NOMINATION TO THIS COURT IT WAS

2713
04:52:08,042 --> 04:52:08,676
THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE

2714
04:52:08,676 --> 04:52:09,377
THOSE SCALES HAVE BEEN TIPPED IN

2715
04:52:09,377 --> 04:52:09,978
FAVOR OF THE ONE SWORN WITNESS

2716
04:52:09,978 --> 04:52:10,678
WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE HER CASE

2717
04:52:10,678 --> 04:52:11,279
BEFORE THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF

2718
04:52:11,279 --> 04:52:11,946
INVESTIGATION, I'LL BE VOTING NO

2719
04:52:11,946 --> 04:52:12,514

04:52:12,514 --> 04:52:13,214
KAVANAUGH TO THE SUPREME COURT.

2721
04:52:13,281 --> 04:52:13,882
>> BEFORE I CALL ON SENATOR

04:52:13,882 --> 04:52:14,482
CORNYN, SINCE THE ABA LETTER

04:52:14,482 --> 04:52:15,116
CAME UP, I HAVE THIS COMMENT,

2724
04:52:15,116 --> 04:52:15,783
THAT PRESIDENT OF THE ABA CALLED

2725
04:52:15,783 --> 04:52:16,451
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION AS YOU

2726
04:52:16,451 --> 04:52:17,152
JUST HEARD AND TO DO IT BEFORE A

2728
04:52:17,352 --> 04:52:17,886
I'VE EXPLAINED MANY TIMES

2729
04:52:17,886 --> 04:52:18,553
ANOTHER FBI INVESTIGATION IS NOT

2730
04:52:18,553 --> 04:52:18,820
NECESSARY.

2731
04:52:18,820 --> 04:52:19,320
THE ABA IS AN OUTSIDE

2732
04:52:19,320 --> 04:52:19,988
ORGANIZATION LIKE ANY OTHER THAT

2733
04:52:19,988 --> 04:52:20,622
CAN SEND US LETTERS AND SHARE

2734
04:52:20,622 --> 04:52:21,189
THEIR ADVICE, BUT WE'RE NOT

2735
04:52:21,189 --> 04:52:21,823
GOING TO LET THEM DICTATE OUR

2736
04:52:21,823 --> 04:52:22,290
COMMITTEE'S BUSINESS.

2737
04:52:22,290 --> 04:52:22,924
ALSO, THIS LETTER IS FROM THE

2738
04:52:22,924 --> 04:52:23,424
PRESIDENT OF THE ABA.

2739
04:52:23,424 --> 04:52:24,025
ONE SIDE, HE DOESN'T REPRESENT

2740
04:52:24,025 --> 04:52:24,626
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

2741
04:52:24,626 --> 04:52:25,260
LAWYERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

2742
04:52:25,260 --> 04:52:25,894
IT ISN'T AT ALL CLEAR THAT ABA

2743
04:52:25,894 --> 04:52:26,561
PRESIDENT HAS AUTHORITY TO SPEAK

2744
04:52:26,561 --> 04:52:27,195
FOR THE ORGANIZATION ON THIS

2745
04:52:27,195 --> 04:52:27,428
MATTER.

2746
04:52:27,428 --> 04:52:27,996
THIS LETTER DOESN'T SAY HE

2747
04:52:27,996 --> 04:52:28,663
CONFERRED WITH ANYONE ELSE OR

2748
04:52:28,663 --> 04:52:29,197
CONVENED THE QUALITICASION

2749
04:52:29,197 --> 04:52:29,864
COMMITTEE BY CONFERENCE CALL OR

2750
04:52:29,864 --> 04:52:30,498
OTHERWISE, DOESN'T REITERATE THE

2751
04:52:30,498 --> 04:52:31,132
FACT JUDGE KAVANAUGH RECEIVED A

2752
04:52:31,132 --> 04:52:31,766
VERY WELL QUALIFIED RATING FROM

2753
04:52:31,766 --> 04:52:32,400
THE ABA STANDING COMMITTEE ON

2754
04:52:32,400 --> 04:52:33,034
THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, AND THE

2755
04:52:33,034 --> 04:52:33,668
STANDING COMMITTEE DID NOT JOIN

2756
04:52:33,668 --> 04:52:33,968
THIS LETTER.

2757
04:52:33,968 --> 04:52:34,369
SENATOR CORNYN.

2758
04:52:34,435 --> 04:52:35,003
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

2759
04:52:35,003 --> 04:52:35,670
I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT I BELIEVE

2760
04:52:35,670 --> 04:52:36,304
THAT IN CONSIDERING DR. FORD'S

2761
04:52:36,304 --> 04:52:36,938
TESTIMONY WE SHOULD TREAT HER

2762
04:52:36,938 --> 04:52:37,572
THE SAME WAY I WOULD WANT MY

2763
04:52:37,572 --> 04:52:38,306
WIFE, MY DAUGHTERS, OR MY MOTHER

2764
04:52:38,306 --> 04:52:38,973
TREATED IF THEY WERE IN SIMILAR

2765
04:52:38,973 --> 04:52:39,307
CIRCUMSTANCES.

2766
04:52:39,307 --> 04:52:40,008
CONVERSELY, I WANT TO MAKE SURE

2767
04:52:40,008 --> 04:52:40,575
WE TREAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH THE

2768
04:52:40,575 --> 04:52:41,142
SAME WAY WE WOULD TREAT MY

2769
04:52:41,142 --> 04:52:41,809
FATHER, MY BROTHER, OR A SON.

2770
04:52:41,809 --> 04:52:42,377
WE OWE THAT TO BOTH JUDGE

2771
04:52:42,377 --> 04:52:42,944
KAVANAUGH AND TO DR. FORD.

2772
04:52:42,944 --> 04:52:43,611
IT IS SIMPLY FALSE TO SAY THAT

2773
04:52:43,611 --> 04:52:44,179
SOMEHOW WE HAVE IN DRAWING

2774
04:52:44,179 --> 04:52:44,879
ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS

2775
04:52:44,879 --> 04:52:45,580
HAS BEEN AN ORCHESTRATED EFFORT

2776
04:52:45,580 --> 04:52:46,147
TO DELAY THE VOTE ON THIS

2777
04:52:46,147 --> 04:52:46,848
NOMINATION, THAT WE HAVE SOMEHOW

2778
04:52:46,848 --> 04:52:47,482
BEEN DISRESPECTFUL OF DR. FORD.

2779
04:52:47,482 --> 04:52:48,049
I'M PROUD OF THE WAY THIS

2780
04:52:48,049 --> 04:52:48,616
COMMITTEE TREATED DR. FORD

2781
04:52:48,616 --> 04:52:48,883
YESTERDAY.

2782
04:52:48,883 --> 04:52:49,517
I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE,

2783
04:52:49,517 --> 04:52:50,118
DIGNIFIED, AND APPARENTLY OUR

2784
04:52:50,118 --> 04:52:50,685
FRIENDS ACROSS THE AISLE ARE

2785
04:52:50,685 --> 04:52:51,319
SOMEHOW UPSET WE GOT A TRAINED

2786
04:52:51,319 --> 04:52:51,953
LAWYER WHO HANDLES CLAIMS LIKE

2787
04:52:51,953 --> 04:52:52,654
THIS ON A DAILY BASIS, TO HANDLE

2788
04:52:52,654 --> 04:52:53,321
IT IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY TO ELICIT

2789
04:52:53,321 --> 04:52:53,922
FACTS AND INFORMATION FROM DR.

2790
04:52:53,922 --> 04:52:54,155
FORD.

2791
04:52:54,589 --> 04:52:55,323
>> IT IS SIMPLY TRYING TO TAKE 

2792
04:52:55,323 --> 04:52:55,790
OUR I OFF THE BALL. 

2793
04:52:55,790 --> 04:52:56,357
IT HAS BEEN A QUICKWITTED 

2794
04:52:56,357 --> 04:52:56,925
EFFORT TO MANIPULATE THIS 

2795
04:52:56,925 --> 04:52:57,659
PROCESS IN A WAY THAT IS UNFAIR 

2796
04:52:57,659 --> 04:52:58,259
TO DR. FORD  AND TO JUDGE 

2797
04:52:58,259 --> 04:52:58,593
KAVANAUGH.  

2798
04:52:58,593 --> 04:52:59,093
AND THAT IS SHAMEFUL. 

2799
04:52:59,093 --> 04:52:59,727
I SAID YESTERDAY I THINK THIS 

2800
04:52:59,727 --> 04:53:00,395
IS ONE OF THE DARKEST DAYS FOR 

2801
04:53:00,395 --> 04:53:01,062
THE UNITED STATE S SENATE SINCE 

2802
04:53:01,062 --> 04:53:01,696
THE McCARTHY HEARINGS IN THE 

2803
04:53:01,696 --> 04:53:01,896
50s. 

2804
04:53:01,896 --> 04:53:02,564
YOU MAY RECALL THE COMMENTS OF 

2805
04:53:02,564 --> 04:53:03,198
ONE OF THE LAWYERS WHO SAID, I 

2806
04:53:03,198 --> 04:53:03,865
NEVER REALLY GAUGED YOUR CRUELTY

2807
04:53:03,865 --> 04:53:04,532
OR RECKLESSNESS BEFORE TODAY. 

2808
04:53:04,532 --> 04:53:05,233
AND ASKED, DO YOU HAVE NO SENSE 

2809
04:53:05,233 --> 04:53:05,567
OF DECENCY? 

2810
04:53:05,567 --> 04:53:06,201
I THINK THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN 

2811
04:53:06,201 --> 04:53:06,868
CRUEL AND RECKLESS AND INDECENT 

2812
04:53:06,868 --> 04:53:07,502
FOR BOTH DR. FORD  AND JUDGE 

2813
04:53:07,502 --> 04:53:08,236
KAVANAUGH . AND IT DID NOT HAVE 

2814
04:53:08,236 --> 04:53:08,670
TO BE THAT WAY. 

2815
04:53:08,670 --> 04:53:09,337
WHEN WE LEARNED YESTERDAY FROM 

2816
04:53:09,337 --> 04:53:09,904
DR. FORD  THAT SHE DID NOT 

2817
04:53:09,904 --> 04:53:10,538
AUTHORIZE THE RELEASE OF THE 

2818
04:53:10,538 --> 04:53:11,239
LETTER OF JULY 30 THAT SHE SENT 

2819
04:53:11,239 --> 04:53:11,873
TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN, SHE DID 

2820
04:53:11,873 --> 04:53:12,473
NOT AUTHORIZE IT, SHE DID NOT 

2821
04:53:12,473 --> 04:53:13,074
WANT IT LEAKED, BUT IT WAS 

2822
04:53:13,074 --> 04:53:13,308
LEAKED. 

2823
04:53:13,308 --> 04:53:13,942
AND SHE SAID THE ONLY PEOPLE 

2824
04:53:13,942 --> 04:53:14,576
THAT HAD POSSESSION OF WITH 

2825
04:53:14,576 --> 04:53:15,043
WERE HER LA, SENATOR 

2826
04:53:15,043 --> 04:53:15,743
FEINSTEIN, AND REPRESENTATIVE --

2827
04:53:15,743 --> 04:53:16,377
THE LETTER HAD TO COME FROM 

2828
04:53:16,377 --> 04:53:17,011
SUMMER WHEN SHE TESTIFIED SHE 

2829
04:53:17,011 --> 04:53:17,612
WAS NOT INFORMED OF GERMAN 

2830
04:53:17,612 --> 04:53:18,313
GRASSLEY'S -- GERMAN GRASSLEY'S 

2831
04:53:18,313 --> 04:53:18,880
INTERVIEW WITH BIPARTISAN 

2832
04:53:18,880 --> 04:53:19,547
PARTICIPATION ABOUT HER CLAIMS, 

2833
04:53:19,547 --> 04:53:20,148
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T -- IT 

2834
04:53:20,148 --> 04:53:20,748
WASN'T CLEAR THAT OFFER HAD 

2835
04:53:20,748 --> 04:53:21,149
EVER BEEN MADE. 

2836
04:53:21,149 --> 04:53:21,849
SO ONE THE LETTER WAS LEAKED BY 

2837
04:53:21,849 --> 04:53:22,483
SOMEBODY, WHEN THE OFFER TO 

2838
04:53:22,483 --> 04:53:23,184
INTERVIW HER BEFORE A PANEL OF 

2839
04:53:23,184 --> 04:53:23,818
INVESTIGATORS AT A PLACE AND 

2840
04:53:23,818 --> 04:53:24,419
TIME OF HER CHOOSING, OUT OF 

2841
04:53:24,419 --> 04:53:25,086
THE PUBLIC EYE, -- WHEN THAT 

2842
04:53:25,086 --> 04:53:25,720
WAS NOT COMMUNICATED, IT SURE 

2843
04:53:25,720 --> 04:53:26,387
LOOKS TO ME TO THE DESIRE TO 

2844
04:53:26,387 --> 04:53:27,021
HAVE WHAT WE HAD YESTERDAY. 

2845
04:53:27,021 --> 04:53:27,689
AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT HAS 

2846
04:53:27,689 --> 04:53:28,389
ONLY BEEN DESCRIBED AS A CIRCUS 

2847
04:53:28,389 --> 04:53:28,723
ATMOSPHERE. 

2848
04:53:28,723 --> 04:53:29,390
CRUEL, RECKLESS, NO SENSE OF 

2849
04:53:29,390 --> 04:53:30,058
DECENCY. I WOULD POINT TO THE 

2850
04:53:30,058 --> 04:53:30,758
FACT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  SAID 

2851
04:53:30,758 --> 04:53:31,459
AS LONG AS THIS NOMINATION HAS 

2852
04:53:31,459 --> 04:53:32,126
BEEN PENDING, YOU HAVE SEEN IT 

2853
04:53:32,126 --> 04:53:32,727
TREND TOWARDS MORE AND MORE 

2854
04:53:32,727 --> 04:53:33,394
SCURRILOUS, SALACIOUS, AND ON 

2855
04:53:33,394 --> 04:53:33,995
COOPERATED ALLEGATIONS BEING 

2856
04:53:33,995 --> 04:53:34,429
MADE AGAINST HIM. 

2857
04:53:34,429 --> 04:53:35,063
ALL OF WHICH THE CHAIRMAN AND 

2858
04:53:35,063 --> 04:53:35,663
THE COMMITTEE, PROFESSIONAL 

2859
04:53:35,663 --> 04:53:36,197
STAFF HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 

2860
04:53:36,197 --> 04:53:36,898
INVESTIGATE. WE HEARD FROM DR. 

2861
04:53:36,898 --> 04:53:37,599
FORD . WE ALSO SAW A CLAIM BY A 

2862
04:53:37,599 --> 04:53:38,199
MISS RAMIREZ THAT WAS ON 

2863
04:53:38,199 --> 04:53:38,833
COOPERATED BY THE DOZENS OF 

2864
04:53:38,833 --> 04:53:39,534
WITNESSES THAT ALLEGEDLY EXISTED

2865
04:53:39,534 --> 04:53:40,201
. THE NEW YORK TIMES COULD NOT 

2866
04:53:40,201 --> 04:53:40,535
CONFIRM THAT. 

2867
04:53:40,535 --> 04:53:41,069
NOBODY WOULD CONFIRM HER 

2868
04:53:41,069 --> 04:53:41,736
ALLEGATION. AND THEN YESTERDAY 

2869
04:53:41,736 --> 04:53:42,403
THE RANKING MEMBER QUOTED FROM 

2870
04:53:42,403 --> 04:53:42,904
SOME OF THE CLAIMS. 

2871
04:53:42,904 --> 04:53:43,538
REPRESENTATIVE -- REPRESENTED 

2872
04:53:43,538 --> 04:53:44,172
BY MICHAEL AVENATTI, AND I WAS 

2873
04:53:44,172 --> 04:53:44,906
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF 

2874
04:53:44,906 --> 04:53:45,540
THE ALLEGATIONS MADE IN THE 

2875
04:53:45,540 --> 04:53:46,107
STATEMENT THAT WE GOT ON 

2876
04:53:46,107 --> 04:53:46,808
SEPTEMBER 25 2018, ACCUSED MARK 

2877
04:53:46,808 --> 04:53:47,442
JUDGE AND BRENT KAVANAUGH TO 

2878
04:53:47,442 --> 04:53:48,142
GANG RAPE  HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS AT 

2879
04:53:48,142 --> 04:53:48,810
A TIME WHEN SHE WAS IN COLLEGE 

2880
04:53:48,810 --> 04:53:49,410
AND SAYS SHE WENT BACK TO 

2881
04:53:49,410 --> 04:53:50,111
PARTIES IN HIGH SCHOOL NOT ON 

2882
04:53:50,111 --> 04:53:50,645
ONE OCCASION, NOT AN TWO 

2883
04:53:50,645 --> 04:53:51,346
OCCASIONS. SHE WENT TO 10 SUCH 

2884
04:53:51,346 --> 04:53:51,913
PARTIES I AM SHOCKED THAT 

2885
04:53:51,913 --> 04:53:52,547
COLLEAGUES WOULD EMBRACE THIS 

2886
04:53:52,547 --> 04:53:53,081
KIND OF ON COOPERATED, 

2887
04:53:53,081 --> 04:53:53,748
OUTRAGEOUS, SALACIOUS ALLEGATION

2888
04:53:53,748 --> 04:53:54,349
CONSIDERING THE FACTS AND THE 

2889
04:53:54,349 --> 04:53:54,983
TIMING AND THE REPRESENTATION 

2890
04:53:54,983 --> 04:53:55,583
BY STORMY DANIELS'S LAWYER. 

2891
04:53:55,583 --> 04:53:56,251
HE'S OBVIOUSLY EAGER FOR MORE 

2892
04:53:56,251 --> 04:53:56,918
PUBLIC ATTENTION AND NOTORIETY. 

2893
04:53:56,918 --> 04:53:57,552
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT IN THE 

2894
04:53:57,552 --> 04:53:58,186
QUOTE FROM THE RANKING MEMBER 

2895
04:53:58,186 --> 04:53:58,853
YESTERDAY WHEN SHE QUOTED FROM 

2896
04:53:58,853 --> 04:53:59,554
SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY 

2897
04:53:59,554 --> 04:53:59,921
MS. SWETNICK.  

2898
04:53:59,921 --> 04:54:00,555
OUR FRIEND SAID THE INTEGRITY 

2899
04:54:00,555 --> 04:54:01,189
OF THE SENATE IS ON TRIAL. 

2900
04:54:01,189 --> 04:54:01,623
I AGREE WITH THAT. 

2901
04:54:01,623 --> 04:54:02,223
AND WE ARE FAILING BADLY. 

2902
04:54:02,223 --> 04:54:02,890
CRUELTY, RECKLESSNESS, INDECENCY

2903
04:54:02,890 --> 04:54:03,591
TOWARDS THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD BE 

2904
04:54:03,591 --> 04:54:04,192
TREATING WITH RESPECT AND 

2905
04:54:04,192 --> 04:54:04,859
DIGNITY. THAT EXTENDS TO MARK 

2906
04:54:04,859 --> 04:54:05,560
JUDGE. ISN'T IT OBVIOUS WHAT IS 

2907
04:54:05,560 --> 04:54:06,261
HAPPENING HERE WITH MARK JUDGE? 

2908
04:54:06,261 --> 04:54:06,861
HE SAYS -- HAS SUBMITTED A 

2909
04:54:06,861 --> 04:54:07,428
STATEMENT UNDER ENTITY OF 

2910
04:54:07,428 --> 04:54:08,029
PENALTIES SAYING THAT BRENT 

2911
04:54:08,029 --> 04:54:08,696
KAVANAUGH AND I WERE FRIENDS IN 

2912
04:54:08,696 --> 04:54:09,297
HIGH SCHOOL BUT WE NEVER -- 

2913
04:54:09,297 --> 04:54:09,897
HAVE NOT SPOKEN IN YEARS. 

2914
04:54:09,897 --> 04:54:10,565
I DO NOT RECALL THE EVENTS. HE 

2915
04:54:10,565 --> 04:54:11,099
SUBMITTED THAT STATEMENT 

2916
04:54:11,099 --> 04:54:11,399
YESTERDAY. 

2917
04:54:11,399 --> 04:54:12,033
SHE SAID I NEVER SAW BRETT ACT 

2918
04:54:12,033 --> 04:54:12,667
IN THE MATTER THAT DR. FORD 

2919
04:54:12,667 --> 04:54:12,967
DESCRIBES. 

2920
04:54:12,967 --> 04:54:13,534
I AM SUBMITTING THIS UNDER 

2921
04:54:13,534 --> 04:54:14,002
PENALTY OF PENALTY. 

2922
04:54:14,002 --> 04:54:14,702
HE SAYS HE HAS NOTHING MORE TO 

2923
04:54:14,702 --> 04:54:14,936
OFFER. 

2924
04:54:14,936 --> 04:54:15,603
HE SUBMITTED THE STATEMENT UNDER

2925
04:54:15,603 --> 04:54:16,037
PENALTY OF FELONY. 

2926
04:54:16,037 --> 04:54:16,671
HERE IS THE OTHER PART -- HE 

2927
04:54:16,671 --> 04:54:17,305
ADMITS TO BEING A RECOVERING 

2928
04:54:17,305 --> 04:54:17,605
ALCOHOLIC. 

2929
04:54:17,605 --> 04:54:18,239
AS WELL AS A CANCER SURVIVOR. 

2930
04:54:18,239 --> 04:54:18,806
HE SAID HE STRUGGLES WITH 

2931
04:54:18,806 --> 04:54:19,507
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SO MUCH 

2932
04:54:19,507 --> 04:54:20,208
THAT HE AVOIDS PUBLIC SPEAKING 

2933
04:54:20,208 --> 04:54:20,908
OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE 

2934
04:54:20,908 --> 04:54:21,542
BELIEVE THE APPROPRIATE COURSE 

2935
04:54:21,542 --> 04:54:22,243
OF CONDUCT IS TO DRAG MR. JUDGE 

2936
04:54:22,243 --> 04:54:22,910
INTO THIS CIRCUS LIKE ATMOSPHERE

2937
04:54:22,910 --> 04:54:23,578
AND TO SUBJECT HIS BATTLE WITH 

2938
04:54:23,578 --> 04:54:24,178
ALCOHOLISM AND ADDICTION TO 

2939
04:54:24,178 --> 04:54:24,746
PUBLIC INVESTIGATION AND 

2940
04:54:24,746 --> 04:54:25,313
SCRUTINY AND CRITICAL -- 

2941
04:54:25,313 --> 04:54:25,613
RIDICULE. 

2942
04:54:25,613 --> 04:54:26,014
THAT IS CRUEL. 

2943
04:54:26,014 --> 04:54:26,614
THAT IS RECKLESS. THAT IS 

2944
04:54:26,614 --> 04:54:26,914
INDECENT. 

2945
04:54:26,914 --> 04:54:27,582
SO MR. CHAIRMAN, IN CONCLUSION, 

2946
04:54:27,582 --> 04:54:28,216
I BELIEVE THIS IS A QUICKWITTED 

2947
04:54:28,216 --> 04:54:28,750
EFFORT TO DELAY THE VOTE. 

2948
04:54:28,750 --> 04:54:29,417
I THINK THE EVIDENCE ALL POINTS 

2949
04:54:29,417 --> 04:54:29,684
TO THAT. 

2950
04:54:29,684 --> 04:54:30,318
AND THE LONGER WE GO WITHOUT 

2951
04:54:30,318 --> 04:54:31,019
VOTING, IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT 

2952
04:54:31,019 --> 04:54:31,653
PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL AVENATTI 

2953
04:54:31,653 --> 04:54:32,186
AND OTHERS EAGER TO GET 

2954
04:54:32,186 --> 04:54:32,854
ATTENTION AND WILLING TO HELD 

2955
04:54:32,854 --> 04:54:33,488
THE MOST SALACIOUS ALLEGATIONS 

2956
04:54:33,488 --> 04:54:34,122
AGAINST THIS NOMINEE THAT WAY 

2957
04:54:34,122 --> 04:54:34,756
-- WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE THE 

2958
04:54:34,756 --> 04:54:34,989
SAME. 

2959
04:54:34,989 --> 04:54:35,690
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ABOUT 150 

2960
04:54:35,690 --> 04:54:36,324
NOMINATIONS ARE PENDING ON THE 

2961
04:54:36,324 --> 04:54:36,724
SENATE CALENDAR. 

2962
04:54:36,724 --> 04:54:37,425
IF THERE IS BEEN ONE THING THAT 

2963
04:54:37,425 --> 04:54:38,059
HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF OUR 

2964
04:54:38,059 --> 04:54:38,660
COLLEAGUES CONDUCT CROSS THE 

2965
04:54:38,660 --> 04:54:39,294
AISLE DURING THE TIME OF THE 

2966
04:54:39,294 --> 04:54:39,894
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TO 

2967
04:54:39,894 --> 04:54:40,561
OBSTRUCT, DELAY, AND DENY THIS 

2968
04:54:40,561 --> 04:54:41,229
ADMINISTRATION THE BENEFIT OF 

2969
04:54:41,229 --> 04:54:41,863
THE NOMINEES WHICH THEY HAVE 

2970
04:54:41,863 --> 04:54:42,530
SENT TO THE SENATE FOR ADVICE 

2971
04:54:42,530 --> 04:54:42,864
AND CONSENT. 

2972
04:54:42,864 --> 04:54:43,531
THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY JUDGES 

2973
04:54:43,531 --> 04:54:44,165
BUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE FEDERAL 

2974
04:54:44,165 --> 04:54:44,499
GOVERNMENT. 

2975
04:54:44,499 --> 04:54:45,099
150 NOMINATIONS BENNETT -- 

2976
04:54:45,099 --> 04:54:45,767
PENDING ON THE CALENDAR BECAUSE 

2977
04:54:45,767 --> 04:54:46,401
THEY WANT TO OBSTRUCT, DELAY, 

2978
04:54:46,401 --> 04:54:47,035
AND DELIGHT THE ADMINISTRATION 

2979
04:54:47,035 --> 04:54:47,702
THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE THEY 

2980
04:54:47,702 --> 04:54:48,336
HAVE CHOSEN TO HELP GOVERN. 

2981
04:54:48,336 --> 04:54:48,970
SO IT STRIKES ME AS ENTIRELY 

2982
04:54:48,970 --> 04:54:49,637
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE 

2983
04:54:49,637 --> 04:54:50,204
SEEN ON THIS NOMINATION. 

2984
04:54:50,204 --> 04:54:50,838
AND I THINK IT IS DISGRACEFUL 

2985
04:54:50,838 --> 04:54:51,506
AS SENATOR HATCH SAID YESTERDAY

2986
04:54:51,506 --> 04:54:52,140
,  I THINK THE WAY DR. FORD  

2987
04:54:52,140 --> 04:54:52,807
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH  HAVE BEEN 

2988
04:54:52,807 --> 04:54:53,508
TREATED IS A SCANDAL AND IT IS 

2989
04:54:53,508 --> 04:54:54,142
CRUEL, RECKLESS, AND INDECENT. 

2990
04:54:54,142 --> 04:54:54,475
>> SENATOR. 

2991
04:54:54,475 --> 04:54:55,009
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 

2992
04:54:55,009 --> 04:54:55,677
I WILL BE FAIRLY BRIEF BECAUSE 

2993
04:54:55,677 --> 04:54:56,277
I ANNOUNCE -- ANNOUNCED BY 

2994
04:54:56,277 --> 04:54:56,844
ATTENTION TO VOTE AGAINST 

2995
04:54:56,844 --> 04:54:57,312
KAVANAUGH ALREADY.  

2996
04:54:57,312 --> 04:54:57,845
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS AN 

2997
04:54:57,845 --> 04:54:58,446
UNPLEASANT RECORD BOTH OF 

2998
04:54:58,446 --> 04:54:59,113
ASSOCIATIONS WITH AND RULINGS 

2999
04:54:59,113 --> 04:54:59,814
FOR A POWERFUL ARRAY OF ACTIVIST

3000
04:54:59,814 --> 04:55:00,448
REPUBLICAN SPECIAL INTERESTS. 

3001
04:55:00,448 --> 04:55:01,149
TO WHOM HE GIVES IN 90% WIN RATE

3002
04:55:01,149 --> 04:55:01,783
-- THE SUPREME COURT HAS AN 

3003
04:55:01,783 --> 04:55:02,450
EQUALLY UNPLEASANT RECORD I'VE 

3004
04:55:02,450 --> 04:55:03,117
5 TO 4 RULINGS FOR THE SAME BIG 

3005
04:55:03,117 --> 04:55:03,418
INTERESTS. 

3006
04:55:03,418 --> 04:55:04,052
NOT THREE OR FOUR TIMES, NOT 

3007
04:55:04,052 --> 04:55:04,686
EVEN ONE OR TWO DOZEN TIMES, 

3008
04:55:04,686 --> 04:55:05,353
BUT UNDER CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS,

3009
04:55:05,353 --> 04:55:05,653
70 TIMES. 

3010
04:55:05,653 --> 04:55:06,354
ALL 5 TO 4 PARTISAN DECISIONS. 

3011
04:55:06,354 --> 04:55:06,921
THE COURT IS FLYING ALL THE 

3012
04:55:06,921 --> 04:55:07,555
WARNING FLAGS OF A CAPTURED 

3013
04:55:07,555 --> 04:55:08,156
AGENCY, DANCING TO SPECIAL 

3014
04:55:08,156 --> 04:55:08,690
INTEREST TUNES, AND RAM 

3015
04:55:08,690 --> 04:55:09,390
PAINTINGS -- RAMPAGING THROUGH 

3016
04:55:09,390 --> 04:55:10,024
PRESIDENT AND PRINCIPAL TO GET 

3017
04:55:10,024 --> 04:55:10,258
THERE. 

3018
04:55:10,258 --> 04:55:10,925
THIS WILL BE A DISASTER FOR THE 

3019
04:55:10,925 --> 04:55:11,559
COURT AND I BELIEVE KAVANAUGH 

3020
04:55:11,559 --> 04:55:12,093
WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THAT 

3021
04:55:12,093 --> 04:55:12,393
DISASTER.  

3022
04:55:12,393 --> 04:55:13,027
HIS PARTNER SAID -- PARTISAN 

3023
04:55:13,027 --> 04:55:13,661
SCREED YESTERDAY WAS TELLING. 

3024
04:55:13,661 --> 04:55:14,262
AS TO YESTERDAY, LET ME BE 

3025
04:55:14,262 --> 04:55:14,862
FRANK, I BELIEVE DR. FORD.  

3026
04:55:14,862 --> 04:55:15,263
I MAY BE WRONG. 

3027
04:55:15,263 --> 04:55:15,730
BUT I BELIEVED HER. 

3028
04:55:15,730 --> 04:55:16,431
AND I BELIEVE KAVANAUGH  DODGE 

3029
04:55:16,431 --> 04:55:17,065
-- DODGED, RANTED AND RAVED, 

3030
04:55:17,065 --> 04:55:17,665
FILIBUSTERED, AND PREVARICATE 

3031
04:55:17,665 --> 04:55:17,865
IT. 

3032
04:55:17,865 --> 04:55:18,499
I DID NOT FIND HIM CREDITABLE. 

3033
04:55:18,499 --> 04:55:19,133
I DON'T BELIEVE HIS FLATULENCE, 

3034
04:55:19,133 --> 04:55:19,701
I DON'T BELIEVE A DOUBLE 

3035
04:55:19,701 --> 04:55:20,335
TRIANGLE IS A DRINKING CAME, 

3036
04:55:20,335 --> 04:55:20,902
AND I DON'T BELIEVE CALLING 

3037
04:55:20,902 --> 04:55:21,569
YOURSELF A GIRLS ALUMNI US IS 

3038
04:55:21,569 --> 04:55:22,003
BEING HER FRIEND. 

3039
04:55:22,003 --> 04:55:22,637
AND I THINK DRINKING UNTIL YOU 

3040
04:55:22,637 --> 04:55:23,404
RALPH OR FALL OUT OF THE BUS OR 

3041
04:55:23,404 --> 04:55:24,105
DON'T REMEMBER THE GAME OR NEED 

3042
04:55:24,105 --> 04:55:24,772
TO PIECE TOGETHER YOUR MEMORY 

3043
04:55:24,772 --> 04:55:25,506
THE NEXT DAY IS MORE CONSISTENT 

3044
04:55:25,506 --> 04:55:26,140
WITH DR. FORD 'S AND OTHERS 

3045
04:55:26,140 --> 04:55:26,674
TESTIMONY THAN HIS OWN. 

3046
04:55:26,674 --> 04:55:27,308
IF DR. FORD'S  TESTIMONY IS 

3047
04:55:27,308 --> 04:55:28,009
TRUE, I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE 

3048
04:55:28,009 --> 04:55:28,676
KAVANAUGH  HAS NO BUSINESS ON 

3049
04:55:28,676 --> 04:55:29,277
THE COURT. AND I FOR ONE, 

3050
04:55:29,277 --> 04:55:29,644
BELIEVED HER. 

3051
04:55:29,644 --> 04:55:30,378
BUT SET ASIDE MY OWN BELIEF, AS 

3052
04:55:30,378 --> 04:55:31,045
A PROSECUTOR I AM HORRIFIED AT 

3053
04:55:31,045 --> 04:55:31,679
WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE. 

3054
04:55:31,679 --> 04:55:32,347
TERMINATING THE FBI BACKGROUND 

3055
04:55:32,347 --> 04:55:33,014
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THESE NEW 

3056
04:55:33,014 --> 04:55:33,648
ALLEGATIONS WERE EVEN CONSIDERED

3057
04:55:33,648 --> 04:55:34,349
, DOING PARTISAN INTERVIEWS BY 

3058
04:55:34,349 --> 04:55:34,982
PARTISAN STAFFERS TO CLEARLY 

3059
04:55:34,982 --> 04:55:35,650
DETERMINE TO -- DECLARATIVELY 

3060
04:55:35,650 --> 04:55:36,351
DETERMINED TO FORCE IT THROUGH. 

3061
04:55:36,351 --> 04:55:37,018
LETTING THE ALLEGED ACCOMPLISH 

3062
04:55:37,018 --> 04:55:37,685
IN THE ASSAULT, THE GUY IN THE 

3063
04:55:37,685 --> 04:55:38,353
ROOM WITH HIM WHEN IT HAPPENED 

3064
04:55:38,353 --> 04:55:39,053
GET AWAY WITH A LAWYER'S LETTER 

3065
04:55:39,053 --> 04:55:39,654
AND NO TESTIMONY, NO CROSS-

3066
04:55:39,654 --> 04:55:40,321
EXAMINATION, THE LAWYERS WILL 

3067
04:55:40,321 --> 04:55:40,955
KNOW THE REVERENCE WITH WHICH 

3068
04:55:40,955 --> 04:55:41,522
WIGMORE IS CITED AS LEGAL 

3069
04:55:41,522 --> 04:55:42,190
AUTHORITY IN DECISIONS ACROSS 

3070
04:55:42,190 --> 04:55:42,790
THE COUNTRY AND FOR DECADES. 

3071
04:55:42,790 --> 04:55:43,491
BEYOND ANY DOUBT, HE WROTE, THE 

3072
04:55:43,491 --> 04:55:44,092
GREATEST LEGAL ENGINE EVER 

3073
04:55:44,092 --> 04:55:44,726
INVENTED FOR THE DISCOVERY OF 

3074
04:55:44,726 --> 04:55:45,360
TRUTH IS CROSS-EXAMINATION. 

3075
04:55:45,360 --> 04:55:46,060
MARK JUDGE IS IN HIDING INSTEAD 

3076
04:55:46,060 --> 04:55:46,594
OF UNDER EXAMINATION. 

3077
04:55:46,594 --> 04:55:47,295
THAT HAS BEEN DISABLED IN THIS 

3078
04:55:47,295 --> 04:55:47,562
MATTER. 

3079
04:55:47,562 --> 04:55:48,262
LET ME HAVE ONE EXAMPLE OF WHERE

3080
04:55:48,262 --> 04:55:48,963
INVESTIGATION MIGHT HELP. HERE 

3081
04:55:48,963 --> 04:55:49,564
IS KAVANAUGH 'S CALENDAR. 

3082
04:55:49,564 --> 04:55:50,231
DR. FORD SAID THAT  KAVANAUGH  

3083
04:55:50,231 --> 04:55:50,898
AND JUDGE AND PJ AND AT LEAST 

3084
04:55:50,898 --> 04:55:51,499
ONE OTHER BOY WERE ALL AT A 

3085
04:55:51,499 --> 04:55:52,200
HOUSE. WELL, WE KNOW KAVANAUGH 

3086
04:55:52,200 --> 04:55:52,533
WAS THERE.  

3087
04:55:52,533 --> 04:55:52,967
IT IS A SCHEDULE. 

3088
04:55:52,967 --> 04:55:53,634
AND HERE IS JUDGE AND HERE IS 

3089
04:55:53,634 --> 04:55:53,801
PJ. 

3090
04:55:53,801 --> 04:55:54,435
HERE ARE ALL THOSE THREE NA 

3091
04:55:54,435 --> 04:55:55,036
BOYS AND OTHERS AT A HOUSE 

3092
04:55:55,036 --> 04:55:55,703
TOGETHER, JUST AS SHE SAID. 

3093
04:55:55,703 --> 04:55:56,304
SHE SAID KAVANAUGH AND JUDGE 

3094
04:55:56,304 --> 04:55:56,971
WERE DRUNK  AND THAT SHE HAD A 

3095
04:55:56,971 --> 04:55:57,205
BEER. 

3096
04:55:57,205 --> 04:55:57,805
BREWSKIS, BEER, THEY WERE 

3097
04:55:57,805 --> 04:55:58,106
DRINKING. 

3098
04:55:58,106 --> 04:55:58,539
JUST AS SHE SAID. 

3099
04:55:58,539 --> 04:55:59,173
KNOW I WILL CONCEDE THAT THE 

3100
04:55:59,173 --> 04:55:59,841
TWO GIRLS ARE NOT MENTIONED BUT 

3101
04:55:59,841 --> 04:56:00,508
SPOT ME THIS, IF YOU HAD JUST 

3102
04:56:00,508 --> 04:56:01,142
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ONE OF THE 

3103
04:56:01,142 --> 04:56:01,743
TWO GIRLS, WOULD YOU ADD THE 

3104
04:56:01,743 --> 04:56:02,410
GIRL'S NAME TO YOUR CALENDAR? 

3105
04:56:02,410 --> 04:56:02,744
I DOUBT IT. 

3106
04:56:02,744 --> 04:56:03,244
THIS MAY BE POWERFUL 

3107
04:56:03,244 --> 04:56:03,878
COOPERATING EVIDENCE THAT THE 

3108
04:56:03,878 --> 04:56:04,479
ASSAULT HAPPENED, THAT IT 

3109
04:56:04,479 --> 04:56:05,146
HAPPENED THAT DAY, AND THAT IT 

3110
04:56:05,146 --> 04:56:05,713
HAPPENED IN THAT PLACE. 

3111
04:56:05,713 --> 04:56:06,381
BUT WITH NO FBI INVESTIGATION, 

3112
04:56:06,381 --> 04:56:06,748
WE CAN'T TELL. 

3113
04:56:06,748 --> 04:56:07,382
THAT'S HOW YOU GET OUT OF THE 

3114
04:56:07,382 --> 04:56:07,749
BATTER'S BOX. 

3115
04:56:07,749 --> 04:56:08,149
YOU INVESTIGATE. 

3116
04:56:08,149 --> 04:56:08,783
IT IS THE LEAST THING A SEXUAL 

3117
04:56:08,783 --> 04:56:09,450
ASSAULT VICTIM IS ENTITLED TO 

3118
04:56:09,450 --> 04:56:09,984
WHEN SHE COMES FORWARD. 

3119
04:56:09,984 --> 04:56:10,651
THE FBI COULD INTERVIEW ALL THE 

3120
04:56:10,651 --> 04:56:11,319
ATTENDEES, NOT JUST TO OBTAIN 

3121
04:56:11,319 --> 04:56:11,986
SIMPLE DENIALS BUT TO CROSSCHECK

3122
04:56:11,986 --> 04:56:12,620
AND SEE IF THE STORIES ADD UP. 

3123
04:56:12,620 --> 04:56:13,254
THE FBI COULD SEE IF THE HOUSE 

3124
04:56:13,254 --> 04:56:13,788
MATCHES THE LOCALITY AND 

3125
04:56:13,788 --> 04:56:14,522
DESCRIPTION DR. FORD  GAVE. THE 

3126
04:56:14,522 --> 04:56:15,123
FBI COULD INQUIRE AFTER AND 

3127
04:56:15,123 --> 04:56:15,757
PURSUE OTHER COOPERATING OR 

3128
04:56:15,757 --> 04:56:16,391
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. IT IS 

3129
04:56:16,391 --> 04:56:16,758
WHAT THEY DO. 

3130
04:56:16,758 --> 04:56:17,458
ANYBODY WHO HAS DONE ANY SERIOUS

3131
04:56:17,458 --> 04:56:18,159
INVESTIGATION KNOWS, YOU DON'T 

3132
04:56:18,159 --> 04:56:18,693
STOP JUST WITH WITNESS 

3133
04:56:18,693 --> 04:56:19,394
STATEMENTS OF INTERESTED PARTIES

3134
04:56:19,394 --> 04:56:20,061
. YOU RUNDOWN COOPERATING AND 

3135
04:56:20,061 --> 04:56:20,695
IMPEACHING -- COOPERATING AND 

3136
04:56:20,695 --> 04:56:21,195
IMPEACHING EVIDENCE. 

3137
04:56:21,195 --> 04:56:21,829
YOU ASK AND GO BACK AGAIN. YOU 

3138
04:56:21,829 --> 04:56:22,430
DO THE BASIC BLOCKING AND 

3139
04:56:22,430 --> 04:56:22,797
INVESTIGATION. 

3140
04:56:22,797 --> 04:56:23,331
PARTISAN INTERVIEWS BY 

3141
04:56:23,331 --> 04:56:23,998
POLITICAL STAFF PRE-DETERMINED 

3142
04:56:23,998 --> 04:56:24,632
TO CLEAR THE NAM -- NOMINEE 

3143
04:56:24,632 --> 04:56:25,299
JUST AREN'T THE SAME AS REAL 

3144
04:56:25,299 --> 04:56:25,833
INVESTIGATORS DOING REAL 

3145
04:56:25,833 --> 04:56:26,534
INVESTIGATION AND COOPERATION. 

3146
04:56:26,534 --> 04:56:27,135
I DON'T THINK THIS IS EVER 

3147
04:56:27,135 --> 04:56:27,769
HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY 

3148
04:56:27,769 --> 04:56:28,403
OF BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. 

3149
04:56:28,403 --> 04:56:29,036
CLOSING OUT THE INVESTIGATION 

3150
04:56:29,036 --> 04:56:29,637
WITHOUT INVESTIGATING THOSE 

3151
04:56:29,637 --> 04:56:30,271
CRITICAL -- CREDIBLE -- THEY 

3152
04:56:30,271 --> 04:56:30,938
WERE CREDIBLE ENOUGH TO GET HER 

3153
04:56:30,938 --> 04:56:31,572
BEFORE THE SENATE AND YET SHE 

3154
04:56:31,572 --> 04:56:32,173
WAS NOT GIVEN THE MOST ASIC, 

3155
04:56:32,173 --> 04:56:32,840
DECENT -- BASIC, DECENT THINK 

3156
04:56:32,840 --> 04:56:33,474
THAT A WITNESS COULD BE GIVEN 

3157
04:56:33,474 --> 04:56:34,041
AFTER THEY COME FORWARD. 

3158
04:56:34,041 --> 04:56:34,509
SINCERE OR THOROUGH 

3159
04:56:34,509 --> 04:56:34,876
INVESTIGATION. 

3160
04:56:34,876 --> 04:56:35,443
CLOSING OUT THE BACKGROUND 

3161
04:56:35,443 --> 04:56:35,943
INVESTIGATION WITHOUT 

3162
04:56:35,943 --> 04:56:36,544
INVESTIGATING NEW, CREDIBLE 

3163
04:56:36,544 --> 04:56:37,178
ALLEGATIONS, NOT ANY OF THREE 

3164
04:56:37,178 --> 04:56:37,745
ALLEGATIONS ALL FROM WOMEN 

3165
04:56:37,745 --> 04:56:38,379
DEMONSTRABLY IN KAVANAUGH 'S 

3166
04:56:38,379 --> 04:56:38,746
SOCIAL CIRCLE. 

3167
04:56:38,746 --> 04:56:39,447
LOOK AT THIS RIDICULOUS LETTER 

3168
04:56:39,447 --> 04:56:40,114
FROM THE OTHER ALLEGED SALIENT 

3169
04:56:40,114 --> 04:56:40,715
-- ASSAILANT IN THE ROOM. 

3170
04:56:40,715 --> 04:56:41,349
IT IS EQUALLY RIDICULOUS IS 

3171
04:56:41,349 --> 04:56:42,016
YESTERDAY'S FIG LEAF, I GUESS 

3172
04:56:42,016 --> 04:56:42,450
YOU WOULD CALL IT. 

3173
04:56:42,450 --> 04:56:43,117
THE SAME STATEMENT IS REPEATED 

3174
04:56:43,117 --> 04:56:43,718
WITH HIS SIGNATURE ON IT. 

3175
04:56:43,718 --> 04:56:44,385
AND ASK YOURSELF, DO YOU THINK 

3176
04:56:44,385 --> 04:56:45,019
INVESTIGATOR KAVANAUGH  WOULD 

3177
04:56:45,019 --> 04:56:45,686
HAVE TOLERATED LETTERS LIKE THIS

3178
04:56:45,686 --> 04:56:46,320
FROM THE THIRD PERSON IN THE 

3179
04:56:46,320 --> 04:56:46,954
ROOM HAD THERE BEEN ONE WITH 

3180
04:56:46,954 --> 04:56:47,655
MR. CLINTON AND MONICA LEWINSKY?

3181
04:56:47,655 --> 04:56:48,256
NEVER IN 1 MILLION YEARS. 

3182
04:56:48,256 --> 04:56:48,890
AND YET THIS IS WHAT WE ARE 

3183
04:56:48,890 --> 04:56:49,524
SUPPOSED TO SATISFY OURSELVES 

3184
04:56:49,524 --> 04:56:50,024
WITH IN THIS MATTER. 

3185
04:56:50,024 --> 04:56:50,691
IT IS PREPOSTEROUS TO ANYONE 

3186
04:56:50,691 --> 04:56:51,259
WHO HAS EVER DONE SERIOUS 

3187
04:56:51,259 --> 04:56:51,626
INVESTIGATION. 

3188
04:56:51,626 --> 04:56:52,293
YET THIS IS WHAT WE ARE LEFT 

3189
04:56:52,293 --> 04:56:52,493
WITH. 

3190
04:56:52,493 --> 04:56:53,094
WE HAVE DONE A BUNCH OF AN 

3191
04:56:53,094 --> 04:56:53,461
INVESTIGATION. 

3192
04:56:53,461 --> 04:56:54,162
OVERTIME, I EXPECT THE FACTS TO 

3193
04:56:54,162 --> 04:56:54,462
COME OUT. 

3194
04:56:54,462 --> 04:56:55,129
THEY HAVE A WAY OF DOING THAT. 

3195
04:56:55,129 --> 04:56:55,830
COVERUPS NEVER LAST. THE SAND IS

3196
04:56:55,830 --> 04:56:56,431
RUNNING THROUGH KAVANAUGH 'S 

3197
04:56:56,431 --> 04:56:56,731
HOURGLASS. 

3198
04:56:56,731 --> 04:56:57,398
I PLEDGE WHATEVER I CAN DO TO 

3199
04:56:57,398 --> 04:56:58,132
MAKE SURE THAT THE TRUTH OF HIS 

3200
04:56:58,132 --> 04:56:58,633
CONDUCT IS ULTIMATELY 

3201
04:56:58,633 --> 04:56:58,966
DETERMINED. 

3202
04:56:58,966 --> 04:56:59,634
SETTING ASIDE THIS, WE GO BACK 

3203
04:56:59,634 --> 04:57:00,234
TO A SUPREME COURT FAR TOO 

3204
04:57:00,234 --> 04:57:00,902
OFTEN DANCING TO THE TUNE OF A 

3205
04:57:00,902 --> 04:57:01,502
HANDFUL OF BIG REPUBLICAN 

3206
04:57:01,502 --> 04:57:01,936
SPECIAL INTERESTS. 

3207
04:57:01,936 --> 04:57:02,570
FUNDING THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 

3208
04:57:02,570 --> 04:57:03,237
THAT IS NOW SELECTING SUPREME 

3209
04:57:03,237 --> 04:57:03,905
COURT NOMINEES, BIG REPUBLICANS 

3210
04:57:03,905 --> 04:57:04,572
USING THE UNLIMITED DARK MONEY 

3211
04:57:04,572 --> 04:57:05,206
POWER THE SUPREME COURT GAVE 

3212
04:57:05,206 --> 04:57:05,873
THEM TO MOUNT TV AD CAMPAIGNS 

3213
04:57:05,873 --> 04:57:06,541
FOR SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. BIG 

3214
04:57:06,541 --> 04:57:07,141
REPUBLICAN SPECIAL INTEREST 

3215
04:57:07,141 --> 04:57:07,809
FUNDING FREQUENT FLYER -- SO-

3216
04:57:07,809 --> 04:57:08,443
CALLED FRIENDS OF THE COURT, 

3217
04:57:08,443 --> 04:57:09,043
OFFERING CONSTANT INSTRUCTION 

3218
04:57:09,043 --> 04:57:09,710
AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE FIVE 

3219
04:57:09,710 --> 04:57:10,378
REPUBLICANS ON THE SUPREME COURT

3220
04:57:10,378 --> 04:57:11,012
AND BIG REPUBLICAN SPECIAL

04:57:11,679 --> 04:57:12,413
OF THOSE 70 FIVE MAC TO 4 -- 5 

3223
04:57:12,413 --> 04:57:12,814
TO 4 VICTORIES. 

3224
04:57:12,814 --> 04:57:13,448
PEOPLE ARE CATCHING ON. THE 

3225
04:57:13,448 --> 04:57:14,081
RECORD OF THIS IS UNDENIABLE. 

3226
04:57:14,081 --> 04:57:14,749
AND AS I SAID, IT WILL BE A 

3227
04:57:14,749 --> 04:57:15,283
DISASTER FOR THE COURT. 

3228
04:57:15,283 --> 04:57:15,716
YOU HAVE MY TIME. 

3229
04:57:15,716 --> 04:57:16,317
>> I THINK I SHOULD TRY TO 

3230
04:57:16,317 --> 04:57:16,984
CLARIFY ABOUT THE CALENDAR THAT 

3231
04:57:16,984 --> 04:57:17,652
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE PUT UP THERE.

3232
04:57:17,652 --> 04:57:18,319
THE ENTRY HAS SIX BOYS LISTED 

3233
04:57:18,319 --> 04:57:19,086
FOR JULY 1, 1982. IT SAYS GO TO 

3234
04:57:19,086 --> 04:57:19,787
TIMMY'S HOUSE WITH JUDGE, TOM, 

3235
04:57:19,787 --> 04:57:20,488
BJ, BRADY AND -- DR. FORD SAID 

3236
04:57:20,488 --> 04:57:21,189
THERE WERE  FORM -- FOUR BOYS 

3237
04:57:21,189 --> 04:57:21,422
THERE. 

3238
04:57:21,422 --> 04:57:22,023
THAT IS A WRONG GATHERING. 

3239
04:57:22,023 --> 04:57:22,623
TWO ALLEGATIONS MADE BY MY 

3240
04:57:22,623 --> 04:57:23,291
COLLEAGUE ARE INCORRECT. FIRST, 

3241
04:57:23,291 --> 04:57:23,858
I NEVER TERMINATED AN FBI 

3242
04:57:23,858 --> 04:57:24,225
INVESTIGATION. 

3243
04:57:24,225 --> 04:57:24,892
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO 

3244
04:57:24,892 --> 04:57:25,393
OPEN OR CLOSE AN FBI 

3245
04:57:25,393 --> 04:57:25,760
INVESTIGATION. 

3246
04:57:25,760 --> 04:57:26,394
THE FBI CONSIDERS THIS MATTER 

3247
04:57:26,394 --> 04:57:26,661
CLOSED. 

3248
04:57:26,661 --> 04:57:27,295
IF MY COLLEAGUES WERE WORRIED 

3249
04:57:27,295 --> 04:57:27,962
ABOUT THE PARTISANSHIP OF THE 

3250
04:57:27,962 --> 04:57:28,563
INVESTIGATION THE DEMOCRATS 

3251
04:57:28,563 --> 04:57:29,230
COULD HAVE JOINED US AT EVERY 

3252
04:57:29,230 --> 04:57:29,664
STEP OF THE WAY. 

3253
04:57:29,664 --> 04:57:30,231
HOWEVER, WE ALL KNOW THEY 

3254
04:57:30,231 --> 04:57:30,798
DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE. 

3255
04:57:30,798 --> 04:57:31,365
SECONDLY, WE DID RECEIVE A 

3256
04:57:31,365 --> 04:57:31,999
LETTER SIGNED BY MARK JUDGE 

3257
04:57:31,999 --> 04:57:32,533
HIMSELF UNDER PENALTY OF 

3258
04:57:32,533 --> 04:57:32,800
PENALTY. 

3259
04:57:32,800 --> 04:57:33,401
I READ IT PREVIOUSLY THIS 

3260
04:57:33,401 --> 04:57:33,668
MORNING. 

3261
04:57:33,668 --> 04:57:34,035
SENATOR LEAHY. 

3262
04:57:34,035 --> 04:57:34,669
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

3263
04:57:34,669 --> 04:57:35,303
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK 

3264
04:57:35,303 --> 04:57:35,870
ABOUT THE NEED FOR AN FBI 

3265
04:57:35,870 --> 04:57:36,237
INVESTIGATION. 

3266
04:57:36,237 --> 04:57:36,904
THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO WISH 

3267
04:57:36,904 --> 04:57:37,572
THAT IS WHERE THIS WOULD HAVE 

3268
04:57:37,572 --> 04:57:38,306
BEGUN AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEGUN. 

3269
04:57:38,306 --> 04:57:38,906
AS IT COULD HAVE BEGUN HAD 

3270
04:57:38,906 --> 04:57:39,574
THESE LETTERS BEEN HANDED OVER 

3271
04:57:39,574 --> 04:57:40,174
TO THE FBI WITH THE REQUEST 

3272
04:57:40,174 --> 04:57:40,908
THAT THEY BE INVESTIGATED AT AN 

3273
04:57:40,908 --> 04:57:41,242
EARLIER TIME. 

3274
04:57:41,242 --> 04:57:41,943
AS EARLY AS LATE JULY OR EARLY 

3275
04:57:41,943 --> 04:57:42,610
AUGUST -- AND LET'S TALK ABOUT 

3276
04:57:42,610 --> 04:57:43,244
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD 

3277
04:57:43,244 --> 04:57:43,611
THAT OCCURRED. 

3278
04:57:43,611 --> 04:57:44,212
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO DR. 

3279
04:57:44,212 --> 04:57:44,812
FORD  AND INTERVIEWED HER. 

3280
04:57:44,812 --> 04:57:45,313
A WOULD HAVE PREPARED. 

3281
04:57:45,313 --> 04:57:45,980
REPORT -- PREPARED A REPORT. 

3282
04:57:45,980 --> 04:57:46,647
THAT WOULD HAVE REFLECTED MORE 

3283
04:57:46,647 --> 04:57:47,315
OR LESS WHAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY.

3284
04:57:47,315 --> 04:57:47,882
PROBABLY A MORE DISTILLED 

3285
04:57:47,882 --> 04:57:48,549
VERSION OF THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT 

3286
04:57:48,549 --> 04:57:49,050
WE SAW IN HER WRITTEN 

3287
04:57:49,050 --> 04:57:49,717
STATEMENTS BEFORE SHE APPEARED 

3288
04:57:49,717 --> 04:57:50,218
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 

3289
04:57:50,218 --> 04:57:50,852
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO JUDGE 

3290
04:57:50,852 --> 04:57:51,486
KAVANAUGH .  THEY WOULD HAVE 

3291
04:57:51,486 --> 04:57:52,119
INTERVIEWED JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

3292
04:57:52,119 --> 04:57:52,787
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD HAVE TOLD 

3293
04:57:52,787 --> 04:57:53,354
US  THEN AS HE TOLD US 

3294
04:57:53,354 --> 04:57:53,988
YESTERDAY THAT NO SUCH EVENT 

3295
04:57:53,988 --> 04:57:54,589
EVER OCCURRED. HE NEVER DID 

3296
04:57:54,589 --> 04:57:55,289
THIS TO ANY WOMAN, NOT IN HIGH 

3297
04:57:55,289 --> 04:57:55,923
SCHOOL, NOT IN COLLEGE, NOT 

3298
04:57:55,923 --> 04:57:56,390
BEFORE, NOT AFTER. 

3299
04:57:56,390 --> 04:57:57,024
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE 

3300
04:57:57,024 --> 04:57:57,658
OTHER ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES TO 

3301
04:57:57,658 --> 04:57:58,259
THIS EVENT INCLUDING MARK 

3302
04:57:58,259 --> 04:57:58,826
JUDGE, PATRICK SMITH, AND 

3303
04:57:58,826 --> 04:57:59,193
LELAND KAISER. 

3304
04:57:59,193 --> 04:57:59,694
THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN 

3305
04:57:59,694 --> 04:58:00,328
STATEMENTS FROM EACH OF THEM 

3306
04:58:00,328 --> 04:58:00,995
AND THOSE STATEMENTS WOULD HAVE 

3307
04:58:00,995 --> 04:58:01,629
INDICATED AS THEY HAVE EACH 

3308
04:58:01,629 --> 04:58:02,296
INDICATED IN WRITTEN STATEMENTS 

3309
04:58:02,296 --> 04:58:02,964
SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT 

3310
04:58:02,964 --> 04:58:03,664
THEY RECALL NO SUCH EVENT EVER 

3311
04:58:03,664 --> 04:58:04,298
OCCURRING. AND SO, WE HAVE 

3312
04:58:04,298 --> 04:58:04,632
INVESTIGATED. 

3313
04:58:04,632 --> 04:58:05,333
I TOO WISH IT HAD BEEN INVESTED 

3314
04:58:05,333 --> 04:58:05,666
BY THE FBI. 

3315
04:58:05,666 --> 04:58:06,367
AND HAD IT BEEN INVESTIGATED AS 

3316
04:58:06,367 --> 04:58:06,934
IT COULD'VE BEEN, AS IT 

3317
04:58:06,934 --> 04:58:07,535
SHOULD'VE BEEN, AS IT WOULD 

3318
04:58:07,535 --> 04:58:08,135
HAVE BEEN WHEN THESE LETTERS 

3319
04:58:08,135 --> 04:58:08,803
WERE RECEIVED, THIS COULD HAVE 

3320
04:58:08,803 --> 04:58:09,470
BEEN HANDLED IN A MORE DIGNIFIED

3321
04:58:09,470 --> 04:58:09,737
MANNER. 

3322
04:58:09,737 --> 04:58:10,271
IN A MANNER MUCH MORE 

3323
04:58:10,271 --> 04:58:10,972
RESPECTFUL TO DR. FORD AND  TO 

3324
04:58:10,972 --> 04:58:11,506
JUDGE KAVANAUGH  AND THE 

3325
04:58:11,506 --> 04:58:12,073
FAMILIES AND THE PROCESS. 

3326
04:58:12,073 --> 04:58:12,707
SOME HAVE MENTIONED TODAY THAT 

3327
04:58:12,707 --> 04:58:13,341
THERE WAS SOME EMOTION IN THE 

3328
04:58:13,341 --> 04:58:13,741
ROOM YESTERDAY. 

3329
04:58:13,741 --> 04:58:14,041
CERTAINLY. 

3330
04:58:14,041 --> 04:58:14,475
THESE ARE EMOTIONAL 

3331
04:58:14,475 --> 04:58:14,842
CIRCUMSTANCES. 

3332
04:58:14,842 --> 04:58:15,510
MY HEART GOES OUT TO DR. FORD 

3333
04:58:15,510 --> 04:58:16,077
AND HER FAMILY AND  JUDGE 

3334
04:58:16,077 --> 04:58:16,644
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY.  

3335
04:58:16,644 --> 04:58:17,278
THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN THROUGH A 

3336
04:58:17,278 --> 04:58:17,478
LOT. 

3337
04:58:17,478 --> 04:58:18,079
I DON'T BLAME EITHER ONE OF 

3338
04:58:18,079 --> 04:58:18,679
THEM FOR DEMONSTRATING SOME 

3339
04:58:18,679 --> 04:58:19,247
EMOTION. NOT FOR A MOMENT 

3340
04:58:19,247 --> 04:58:19,881
HURRICANE IN THE CASE OF DR. 

3341
04:58:19,881 --> 04:58:20,481
FORD,  CLEARLY SHE HAS BEEN 

3342
04:58:20,481 --> 04:58:21,048
THROUGH SOMETHING AWFUL. 

3343
04:58:21,048 --> 04:58:21,749
IN THE CASE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

3344
04:58:21,749 --> 04:58:22,383
HE HAS SEEN  IN ADDITION TO 

3345
04:58:22,383 --> 04:58:23,017
THIS ALLEGATION, DRAGGING HIS 

3346
04:58:23,017 --> 04:58:23,718
NAME INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD, HE 

3347
04:58:23,718 --> 04:58:24,285
HAS SEEN HIS NAME DRAGGED 

3348
04:58:24,285 --> 04:58:24,886
THROUGH THE MUD ON A LOT OF 

3349
04:58:24,886 --> 04:58:25,453
OTHER THINGS INCLUDING AN 

3350
04:58:25,453 --> 04:58:26,153
ALLEGATION THAT HE WAS INVOLVED 

3351
04:58:26,153 --> 04:58:26,654
IN AND RUNNING A DRUG 

3352
04:58:26,654 --> 04:58:27,355
DISTRIBUTION AND GANG RAPE RING.

3353
04:58:27,355 --> 04:58:28,022
ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION IF YOU

3354
04:58:28,022 --> 04:58:28,723
OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE WAS ALLEGED 

3355
04:58:28,723 --> 04:58:29,290
TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN 

3356
04:58:29,290 --> 04:58:29,891
RUNNING SOMETHING LIKE THAT, 

3357
04:58:29,891 --> 04:58:30,491
MIGHT NOT YOU FEEL A LITTLE 

3358
04:58:30,491 --> 04:58:30,925
EMOTIONAL AS WELL? 

3359
04:58:30,925 --> 04:58:31,626
MIGHT NOT THAT SPILL INTO YOUR 

3360
04:58:31,626 --> 04:58:32,293
TESTIMONY IF YOU ARE CALLED IN 

3361
04:58:32,293 --> 04:58:32,860
FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE? 

3362
04:58:32,860 --> 04:58:33,561
LOOK, WE HAVE A JOB TO DO HERE 

3363
04:58:33,561 --> 04:58:33,794
TODAY. 

3364
04:58:33,794 --> 04:58:34,428
OUR JOB YESTERDAY WAS TO HEAR 

3365
04:58:34,428 --> 04:58:35,162
FROM DR. FORD  AND TO HEAR FROM 

3366
04:58:35,162 --> 04:58:35,563
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

3367
04:58:35,563 --> 04:58:36,030
WE HAVE DONE THAT. 

3368
04:58:36,030 --> 04:58:36,564
OUR JOB NOW IS TO VOTE. 

3369
04:58:36,564 --> 04:58:37,231
TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. 

3370
04:58:37,231 --> 04:58:37,698
THANK, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

3371
04:58:37,698 --> 04:58:38,299
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

3372
04:58:38,299 --> 04:58:38,900
I SAID THE FIRST DAY OF THE 

3373
04:58:38,900 --> 04:58:39,500
FIRST HEARING REGARDING JUDGE 

3374
04:58:39,500 --> 04:58:40,134
KAVANAUGH  THAT THIS IS NOT 

3375
04:58:40,134 --> 04:58:40,768
NORMAL. IT MIGHT LOOK NORMAL. 

3376
04:58:40,768 --> 04:58:41,269
WE HAVE THE NOMINEE. 

3377
04:58:41,269 --> 04:58:41,969
WE HAVE THE FAMILY BEHIND THEM. 

3378
04:58:41,969 --> 04:58:42,503
YOU HAVE THE CAMERAS ON. 

3379
04:58:42,503 --> 04:58:42,904
IT WASN'T NORMAL. 

3380
04:58:42,904 --> 04:58:43,571
IT WASN'T NORMAL BECAUSE THIS 

3381
04:58:43,571 --> 04:58:44,171
NOMINEE WAS HANDPICKED BY A 

3382
04:58:44,171 --> 04:58:44,839
PRESENT WHO IN THE LAST WEEK 

3383
04:58:44,839 --> 04:58:45,439
HAS GONE AFTER HIS ATTORNEY 

3384
04:58:45,439 --> 04:58:46,140
GENERAL, THREATENED TO FIRE THE 

3385
04:58:46,140 --> 04:58:46,807
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WAS 

3386
04:58:46,807 --> 04:58:47,241
OVERSEEING A MAJOR 

3387
04:58:47,241 --> 04:58:47,842
INVESTIGATION, AND NATIONAL 

3388
04:58:47,842 --> 04:58:48,342
SECURITY INVESTIGATION, 

3389
04:58:48,342 --> 04:58:49,010
HANDPICKED BY A PRESIDENT WHO 

3390
04:58:49,010 --> 04:58:49,677
IS UNDERMINING LAW ENFORCEMENT, 

3391
04:58:49,677 --> 04:58:50,344
CONSTANTLY UNDERMINING THE FBI, 

3392
04:58:50,344 --> 04:58:50,878
AND YET, THIS PRESIDENT 

3393
04:58:50,878 --> 04:58:51,512
SELECTED A NOMINEE WHO HAS THE 

3394
04:58:51,512 --> 04:58:52,179
MOST EXPENSIVE YOU OF EXECUTIVE 

3395
04:58:52,179 --> 04:58:52,747
POWER THAT WE HAVE SEEN. 

3396
04:58:52,747 --> 04:58:53,347
A PRESIDENT -- A VIEW OF 

3397
04:58:53,347 --> 04:58:53,981
EXECUTIVE POWER ACCORDING TO 

3398
04:58:53,981 --> 04:58:54,682
HIS WRITINGS SAY IN AN OPINION 

3399
04:58:54,682 --> 04:58:55,316
THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE 

3400
04:58:55,316 --> 04:58:55,816
ABLE TO DECLARE LAWS 

3401
04:58:55,816 --> 04:58:56,417
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN HIS OWN 

3402
04:58:56,417 --> 04:58:57,084
VIEWS IN LEGAL WRITINGS THAT A 

3403
04:58:57,084 --> 04:58:57,785
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE 

3404
04:58:57,785 --> 04:58:58,452
IMMUNE FROM INVESTIGATION WHILE 

3405
04:58:58,452 --> 04:58:58,886
SITTING IN OFFICE. 

3406
04:58:58,886 --> 04:58:59,487
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A SPECIAL 

3407
04:58:59,487 --> 04:58:59,887
COUNSEL STATUTE. 

3408
04:58:59,887 --> 04:59:00,421
THAT'S WHERE WE START. 

3409
04:59:00,421 --> 04:59:01,155
THAT'S THE CORE HERE AS WE LOOK 

3410
04:59:01,155 --> 04:59:01,789
AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES 

3411
04:59:01,789 --> 04:59:02,223
THAT WE ARE FACING. 

3412
04:59:02,223 --> 04:59:02,857
THE SECOND REASON THIS ISN'T 

3413
04:59:02,857 --> 04:59:03,558
NORMAL IS THAT WE DID NOT GET 

3414
04:59:03,558 --> 04:59:04,191
THE INFORMATION WE NEEDED TO 

3415
04:59:04,191 --> 04:59:04,625
MAKE A DECISION. 

3416
04:59:04,625 --> 04:59:05,192
I COME FROM A STATE THAT 

3417
04:59:05,192 --> 04:59:05,660
BELIEVES IN PROCESS. 

3418
04:59:05,660 --> 04:59:06,327
IN MY OLD JOB, I HEADED UP THE 

3419
04:59:06,327 --> 04:59:06,894
HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY'S 

3420
04:59:06,894 --> 04:59:07,161
OFFICE. 

3421
04:59:07,161 --> 04:59:07,762
WE HANDLED 12,000 JUVENILE 

3422
04:59:07,762 --> 04:59:08,296
CASES EVERY SINGLE YEAR. 

3423
04:59:08,296 --> 04:59:08,930
SO I SAW CASES JUST LIKE THE 

3424
04:59:08,930 --> 04:59:09,564
ONE WE HEARD ABOUT YESTERDAY. 

3425
04:59:09,564 --> 04:59:10,264
BUT I WOULD ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE 

3426
04:59:10,264 --> 04:59:10,965
IF WE HAD TO LET A CASE GO, IF 

3427
04:59:10,965 --> 04:59:11,599
WE HAD TO MAKE A DEAL THAT 

3428
04:59:11,599 --> 04:59:12,199
PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE, OUR ROLE 

3429
04:59:12,199 --> 04:59:12,900
WAS TO BE MINISTERS OF JUSTICE. 

3430
04:59:12,900 --> 04:59:13,534
IT WAS TO CONVICT THE GUILTY 

3431
04:59:13,534 --> 04:59:14,201
BUT ALSO PROTECTING THE INNOCENT

3432
04:59:14,201 --> 04:59:14,802
. I DON'T THINK WE PROTECTED 

3433
04:59:14,802 --> 04:59:15,336
THE INNOCENT VERY WELL 

3434
04:59:15,336 --> 04:59:15,636
YESTERDAY. 

3435
04:59:15,636 --> 04:59:16,203
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK 

3436
04:59:16,203 --> 04:59:16,737
THAT WE ARE DOING TODAY. 

3437
04:59:16,737 --> 04:59:17,405
THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEST BEATING

3438
04:59:17,405 --> 04:59:18,072
THAT WENT ON YESTERDAY ON THE 

3439
04:59:18,072 --> 04:59:18,406
OTHER SIDE. 

3440
04:59:18,406 --> 04:59:19,073
AND IT WAS PRETTY EFFECTIVE, I 

3441
04:59:19,073 --> 04:59:19,674
GUESS, IF THE GOAL WAS TO 

3442
04:59:19,674 --> 04:59:20,308
DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

3443
04:59:20,308 --> 04:59:20,975
FROM WHAT THEY HAD HEARD IN THE 

3444
04:59:20,975 --> 04:59:21,676
MORNING, TO DISTRACT AND DEFLECT

3445
04:59:21,676 --> 04:59:22,243
FROM THE MOVING, POWERFUL, 

3446
04:59:22,243 --> 04:59:22,710
TESTIMONY WE HEARD. 

3447
04:59:22,710 --> 04:59:23,311
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT 

3448
04:59:23,311 --> 04:59:23,978
RESPECTING DR. FORD  WHEN WE 

3449
04:59:23,978 --> 04:59:24,612
ARE NOT GIVING HER THE RESPECT 

3450
04:59:24,612 --> 04:59:25,279
OF HAVING AN INVESTIGATION OF 

3451
04:59:25,279 --> 04:59:25,947
THE CASE THAT SHE MADE TO US 

3452
04:59:25,947 --> 04:59:26,614
YESTERDAY. IT WAS A WHILE AGO 

3453
04:59:26,614 --> 04:59:27,048
THAT THIS HAPPEN. 

3454
04:59:27,048 --> 04:59:27,615
THERE ARE OTHER CLAIMS OUT 

3455
04:59:27,615 --> 04:59:27,982
THERE AS WELL. 

3456
04:59:27,982 --> 04:59:28,649
BUT IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE 

3457
04:59:28,649 --> 04:59:29,150
AS SENATOR WHITEHOUSE 

3458
04:59:29,150 --> 04:59:29,784
ARTICULATED, IF YOU DON'T GO 

3459
04:59:29,784 --> 04:59:30,484
BACK AND LOOK AT THINGS AND YOU 

3460
04:59:30,484 --> 04:59:31,052
DON'T LOOK AT COOPERATING 

3461
04:59:31,052 --> 04:59:31,686
EVIDENCE -- COOPERATING -- 

3462
04:59:31,686 --> 04:59:32,286
CORROBORATING  EVIDENCE, YOU 

3463
04:59:32,286 --> 04:59:32,954
WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 

3464
04:59:32,954 --> 04:59:33,654
THERE IS A FINITE PERIOD FOR AN 

3465
04:59:33,654 --> 04:59:34,155
F PI INVESTIGATION. 

3466
04:59:34,155 --> 04:59:34,655
-- FBI INVESTIGATION. 

3467
04:59:34,655 --> 04:59:34,956
GEORGE H.W. 

3468
04:59:34,956 --> 04:59:35,623
BUSH ORDERED THAT IN THE ANITA 

3469
04:59:35,623 --> 04:59:35,923
HILL CASE. 

3470
04:59:35,923 --> 04:59:36,290
THAT HAPPENED. 

3471
04:59:36,290 --> 04:59:36,657
IT'S HAPPENED. 

3472
04:59:36,657 --> 04:59:37,258
THAT IS NOT EVEN HAPPENING 

3473
04:59:37,258 --> 04:59:37,458
HERE. 

3474
04:59:37,458 --> 04:59:38,159
WE ARE NOT GIVING DR. FORD  THE 

3475
04:59:38,159 --> 04:59:38,659
RESPECT OF HAVING THAT 

3476
04:59:38,659 --> 04:59:39,026
INVESTIGATION. 

3477
04:59:39,026 --> 04:59:39,393
THAT IS WRONG. 

3478
04:59:39,393 --> 04:59:40,061
THAT IS NOT BEING MINISTERS OF 

3479
04:59:40,061 --> 04:59:40,328
JUSTICE. 

3480
04:59:40,328 --> 04:59:40,895
THIS WAS A WOMAN WITH NO 

3481
04:59:40,895 --> 04:59:41,529
POLITICAL BACKGROUND WHO MADE 

3482
04:59:41,529 --> 04:59:42,163
AN ATTEMPT TO CALL THE FRONT 

3483
04:59:42,163 --> 04:59:42,797
OFFICE OF HURT CONGRESSWOMAN. 

3484
04:59:42,797 --> 04:59:43,264
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID. 

3485
04:59:43,264 --> 04:59:43,931
SHE DID THIS BEFORE THE NOMINEE 

3486
04:59:43,931 --> 04:59:44,565
WAS EVEN SELECTED. SHE DID IT 

3487
04:59:44,565 --> 04:59:45,166
WHEN THE NOMINEE WAS ON THE 

3488
04:59:45,166 --> 04:59:45,466
SHORTLIST. 

3489
04:59:45,466 --> 04:59:45,900
SHE WAS CONCERNED. 

3490
04:59:45,900 --> 04:59:46,300
THAT SO SHE DID. 

3491
04:59:46,300 --> 04:59:47,001
DON'T ARGUE THAT SHE IS PART OF 

3492
04:59:47,001 --> 04:59:47,668
SOME MASSIVE POLITICAL STRATEGY.

3493
04:59:47,668 --> 04:59:48,135
THOSE ARE THE FACTS. 

3494
04:59:48,135 --> 04:59:48,669
AND YES, IT IS MESSY. 

3495
04:59:48,669 --> 04:59:49,337
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS MESSY. 

3496
04:59:49,337 --> 04:59:49,971
THINGS COME IN AT THE LAST 

3497
04:59:49,971 --> 04:59:50,237
MINUTE. 

3498
04:59:50,237 --> 04:59:50,771
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. 

3499
04:59:50,771 --> 04:59:51,339
IT HAPPENS BEFORE TRIAL. 

3500
04:59:51,339 --> 04:59:52,006
IT HAPPENS BEFORE THE HEARING. 

3501
04:59:52,006 --> 04:59:52,707
THE QUESTION IS NOT IF IT IS 

3502
04:59:52,707 --> 04:59:53,307
MESSY, SENATOR FLAKE HIMSELF 

3503
04:59:53,307 --> 04:59:53,975
SAID YESTERDAY, THIS IS NOT A 

3504
04:59:53,975 --> 04:59:54,342
GOOD PROCESS. 

3505
04:59:54,342 --> 04:59:54,875
BUT IT IS ALL WE'VE GOT. 

3506
04:59:54,875 --> 04:59:55,576
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DO YOU DO 

3507
04:59:55,576 --> 04:59:55,977
WHEN IT HAPPENS? 

3508
04:59:55,977 --> 04:59:56,644
WHEN YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF 

3509
04:59:56,644 --> 04:59:57,278
POWER, WHAT YOU DO WHEN IT 

3510
04:59:57,278 --> 04:59:57,545
HAPPENS? 

3511
04:59:57,545 --> 04:59:58,212
YOU MAY NOT LIKE HOW THIS CAME 

3512
04:59:58,212 --> 04:59:58,746
IN AT THE LAST MINUTE. 

3513
04:59:58,746 --> 04:59:59,347
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOWN 

3514
04:59:59,347 --> 04:59:59,847
ABOUT IT EARLIER TOO. 

3515
04:59:59,847 --> 05:00:00,214
BUT I DID NOT. 

3516
05:00:00,214 --> 05:00:00,915
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO 

3517
05:00:00,915 --> 05:00:01,349
WHEN IT HAPPENS? 

3518
05:00:01,349 --> 05:00:02,016
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS, YOU DON'T 

3519
05:00:02,016 --> 05:00:02,617
JUST PUT IT UNDER THE RUG. 

3520
05:00:02,617 --> 05:00:03,351
FOR SO MANY YEARS, THIS IS WHAT 

3521
05:00:03,351 --> 05:00:04,018
HAPPENED TO CLAIMS LIKE THIS. 

3522
05:00:04,018 --> 05:00:04,685
THEY WERE JUST SWEPT UNDER THE 

3523
05:00:04,685 --> 05:00:04,885
RUG. 

3524
05:00:04,885 --> 05:00:05,586
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOUSE, NO 

3525
05:00:05,586 --> 05:00:06,220
MATTER HOW BAD IT WAS DIDN'T 

3526
05:00:06,220 --> 05:00:06,821
BELONG IN THE COURTHOUSE. 

3527
05:00:06,821 --> 05:00:07,455
AND THAT HURT WOMEN AND THAT 

3528
05:00:07,455 --> 05:00:08,089
HER CHILDREN FOR A LONG, LONG 

3529
05:00:08,089 --> 05:00:08,322
TIME. 

3530
05:00:08,322 --> 05:00:08,990
BUT THE TIMES ARE CHANGING NOW. 

3531
05:00:08,990 --> 05:00:09,590
WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO MADE A 

3532
05:00:09,590 --> 05:00:09,991
CREDIBLE CLAIM. 

3533
05:00:09,991 --> 05:00:10,625
THE CHAIRMAN EVEN THANKED HER 

3534
05:00:10,625 --> 05:00:11,025
FOR HER BRAVERY. 

3535
05:00:11,025 --> 05:00:11,659
WHERE IS THE BRAVERY IN THIS 

3536
05:00:11,659 --> 05:00:11,892
ROOM? 

3537
05:00:11,892 --> 05:00:12,593
THIS RUSH, WHEN WE COULD HAVE A 

3538
05:00:12,593 --> 05:00:13,160
FINITE PERIOD OF TIME TO 

3539
05:00:13,160 --> 05:00:13,794
INTERVIEW A FINITE PERIOD OF 

3540
05:00:13,794 --> 05:00:14,428
WITNESSES. SOMEONE SHE ALLEGES 

3541
05:00:14,428 --> 05:00:15,096
WAS IN THE VERY ROOM WHERE IT 

3542
05:00:15,096 --> 05:00:15,363
HAPPENED. 

3543
05:00:15,363 --> 05:00:15,930
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO CROSS-

3544
05:00:15,930 --> 05:00:16,564
EXAMINE THEN -- THEM OR ASK 

3545
05:00:16,564 --> 05:00:16,864
QUESTIONS. 

3546
05:00:16,864 --> 05:00:17,531
WE DON'T GET TO SAY YOU WILL GET

3547
05:00:17,531 --> 05:00:18,232
IN CRITICAL -- CRIMINAL TROUBLE 

3548
05:00:18,232 --> 05:00:18,799
IF YOU DON'T ANSWER THESE 

3549
05:00:18,799 --> 05:00:19,266
QUESTIONS CORRECTLY. 

3550
05:00:19,266 --> 05:00:19,867
THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING. 

3551
05:00:19,867 --> 05:00:20,468
WE HAVE A POLYGRAPH EXPERT. 

3552
05:00:20,468 --> 05:00:21,135
YESTERDAY, I PUT THAT EXAM ON 

3553
05:00:21,135 --> 05:00:21,469
THE RECORD. 

3554
05:00:21,469 --> 05:00:22,036
PEOPLE WERE BRISTLING OVER 

3555
05:00:22,036 --> 05:00:22,269
THERE. 

3556
05:00:22,269 --> 05:00:22,903
WE WENT TO SEE THE CHARTS. 

3557
05:00:22,903 --> 05:00:23,537
WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE THE 

3558
05:00:23,537 --> 05:00:24,171
EXPERT TESTIFY AND EXPLAIN HOW 

3559
05:00:24,171 --> 05:00:24,605
THIS WAS VERIFIED. 

3560
05:00:24,605 --> 05:00:25,206
AND YES, AS JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

3561
05:00:25,206 --> 05:00:25,906
POINTED OUT  THIS IS NOT A TEST 

3562
05:00:25,906 --> 05:00:26,540
THAT IS ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. 

3563
05:00:26,540 --> 05:00:26,841
GUESS WHAT? 

3564
05:00:26,841 --> 05:00:27,475
WE USE IT FOR JOB INTERVIEWS, 

3565
05:00:27,475 --> 05:00:28,109
THE FBI, THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT

3566
05:00:28,109 --> 05:00:28,676
, THE CIA, AND THE NOMINEE 

3567
05:00:28,676 --> 05:00:29,343
HIMSELF HAS EVEN SAID THAT THIS 

3568
05:00:29,343 --> 05:00:29,910
IS USEFUL TO USE FOR THOSE 

3569
05:00:29,910 --> 05:00:30,544
PURPOSES IN A CASE THAT HE 

3570
05:00:30,544 --> 05:00:30,945
DECIDED IN 2016. 

3571
05:00:30,945 --> 05:00:31,612
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF WITNESSES 

3572
05:00:31,612 --> 05:00:32,279
WE COULD HEAR FROM IF WE HAD 

3573
05:00:32,279 --> 05:00:32,947
THE OPPORTUNITY, MAYBE ONE WEEK 

3574
05:00:32,947 --> 05:00:33,247
TO DO IT. 

3575
05:00:33,247 --> 05:00:33,814
I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. 

3576
05:00:33,814 --> 05:00:34,448
IF WE WANT TO SHOW DR. FORD 

3577
05:00:34,448 --> 05:00:34,982
RESPECT, WE GAVE HER THE 

3578
05:00:34,982 --> 05:00:35,583
RSPECT OF HAVING HER CASE 

3579
05:00:35,583 --> 05:00:36,250
HEARD  AND THE EVIDENCE LOOKED 

3580
05:00:36,250 --> 05:00:36,417
AT. 

3581
05:00:36,417 --> 05:00:37,084
I LOOK AT IT AS WHAT ARE YOU 

3582
05:00:37,084 --> 05:00:37,318
HIDING? 

3583
05:00:37,318 --> 05:00:37,785
WHAT WOULD IT HURT? 

3584
05:00:37,785 --> 05:00:38,486
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH  IS SO SURE 

3585
05:00:38,486 --> 05:00:39,186
THAT HE HAS THIS CORROBORATING  

3586
05:00:39,186 --> 05:00:39,854
EVIDENCE AND WHAT THESE THINGS 

3587
05:00:39,854 --> 05:00:40,554
MEAN, WHAT IS HE AFRAID OF IF 

3588
05:00:40,554 --> 05:00:41,222
WE JUST SPEND ONE WEEK LOOKING 

3589
05:00:41,222 --> 05:00:41,656
AT THE EVIDENCE? 

3590
05:00:41,656 --> 05:00:42,289
WHAT I HAVE HEARD TODAY JUST 

3591
05:00:42,289 --> 05:00:42,923
ADDS TO THIS. WHEN I HEARD THE 

3592
05:00:42,923 --> 05:00:43,491
SANCTIMONIOUS TALK ABOUT 

3593
05:00:43,491 --> 05:00:44,125
SOMETIME -- SOME KIND OF A 

3594
05:00:44,125 --> 05:00:44,792
POLITICAL STRATEGY, I WILL GIVE 

3595
05:00:44,792 --> 05:00:45,459
YOU EXHIBIT A. YOU TALK ABOUT A 

3596
05:00:45,459 --> 05:00:46,093
NOMINEE GETTING OFF THE FLOOR 

3597
05:00:46,093 --> 05:00:46,761
WHEN ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS 

3598
05:00:46,761 --> 05:00:47,428
ONE WEEK FOR AN INVESTIGATION. 

3599
05:00:47,428 --> 05:00:48,095
AND YOU KEPT GARLAND AWAY FROM 

3600
05:00:48,095 --> 05:00:48,729
THIS COMMITTEE FOR 10 MONTHS. 

3601
05:00:48,729 --> 05:00:49,397
THAT'S NOT EVEN A COMPARISON. 

3602
05:00:49,397 --> 05:00:50,064
THAT WAS A STRATEGY YESTERDAY. 

3603
05:00:50,064 --> 05:00:50,564
BOY, IT WAS A STRATEGY. 

3604
05:00:50,564 --> 05:00:51,165
I HOPE THAT SOME OF THE 

3605
05:00:51,165 --> 05:00:51,699
SENATORS WERE NOT MADE A 

3606
05:00:51,699 --> 05:00:52,299
DECISION, CORE NOT ON THIS 

3607
05:00:52,299 --> 05:00:52,867
COMMITTEE, A LOOK AT THE 

3608
05:00:52,867 --> 05:00:53,467
EVIDENCE AND LOOK AT WHAT 

3609
05:00:53,467 --> 05:00:54,068
HAPPENED AND SEE IT FOR THE 

3610
05:00:54,068 --> 05:00:54,602
STRATEGY THAT IT WAS. 

3611
05:00:54,602 --> 05:00:55,202
I ASKED DR. FORD  YESTERDAY 

3612
05:00:55,202 --> 05:00:55,836
ABOUT WHAT SHE REMEMBERS FROM 

3613
05:00:55,836 --> 05:00:56,470
THAT NIGHT, AND I ALSO ASKED 

3614
05:00:56,470 --> 05:00:57,104
HER WHAT SHE COULDN'T FORGET. 

3615
05:00:57,104 --> 05:00:57,705
AND HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID, THE 

3616
05:00:57,705 --> 05:00:58,372
STAIRWELL, THE LIVING ROOM, THE 

3617
05:00:58,372 --> 05:00:59,006
BEDROOM, THE BED ON THE RIGHT 

3618
05:00:59,006 --> 05:00:59,640
SIDE OF THE ROOM, THE BATHROOM 

3619
05:00:59,640 --> 05:01:00,174
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY, THE 

3620
05:01:00,174 --> 05:01:00,808
LAUGHTER, THEY ARE GLORIOUS 

3621
05:01:00,808 --> 05:01:01,475
LAUGHTER, THE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS 

3622
05:01:01,475 --> 05:01:02,176
TO ESCAPE IN THE FINAL ABILITY 

3623
05:01:02,176 --> 05:01:02,476
TO DO SO. 

3624
05:01:02,476 --> 05:01:03,144
WE HEARD HER TALK ABOUT HOW SHE 

3625
05:01:03,144 --> 05:01:03,811
HAD A CIVIC DUTY TO BRING THIS 

3626
05:01:03,811 --> 05:01:04,011
UP. 

3627
05:01:04,011 --> 05:01:04,612
WE HEARD HER TESTIFY HOW SHE 

3628
05:01:04,612 --> 05:01:05,279
BROUGHT THIS UP 6 YEARS BEFORE 

3629
05:01:05,279 --> 05:01:05,880
TO A COUNSELOR ABOUT HOW HER 

3630
05:01:05,880 --> 05:01:06,414
HUSBAND RECALLS USING THE 

3631
05:01:06,414 --> 05:01:06,781
JUDGE'S NAME. 

3632
05:01:06,781 --> 05:01:07,415
IN THE RULES OF EVIDENCE IT 

3633
05:01:07,415 --> 05:01:08,082
SAYS THAT STATEMENTS MADE TO A 

3634
05:01:08,082 --> 05:01:08,683
PROFESSIONAL ARE CONSIDERED 

3635
05:01:08,683 --> 05:01:08,983
CREDIBLE. 

3636
05:01:08,983 --> 05:01:09,617
YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE'S GOALS. 

3637
05:01:09,617 --> 05:01:10,284
WHAT WOULD BE THEIR REASONS TO 

3638
05:01:10,284 --> 05:01:10,518
LIKE? 

3639
05:01:10,518 --> 05:01:11,152
I LOOK AT A JUDGE WHO HAS A 

3640
05:01:11,152 --> 05:01:11,819
CAREER MAKING MOMENT TO GET ON 

3641
05:01:11,819 --> 05:01:12,486
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

3642
05:01:12,486 --> 05:01:13,187
. AND NOBODY IS ENTITLED TO BE 

3643
05:01:13,187 --> 05:01:13,821
ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 

3644
05:01:13,821 --> 05:01:14,055
COURT. 

3645
05:01:14,055 --> 05:01:14,689
AND THEN YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO 

3646
05:01:14,689 --> 05:01:15,389
CAME FORWARD, SENT A LETTER AND 

3647
05:01:15,389 --> 05:01:16,057
TRIED TO DO WHAT SHE COULD DO 

3648
05:01:16,057 --> 05:01:16,724
KEEP HER NAME OUT OF THE NEWS 

3649
05:01:16,724 --> 05:01:17,358
AND FINALLY WHEN THE REPORTERS 

3650
05:01:17,358 --> 05:01:17,992
SHOWED UP, SHE CAME FORWARD. 

3651
05:01:17,992 --> 05:01:18,659
I JUST SEE THESE AS DIFFERENT. 

3652
05:01:18,659 --> 05:01:19,260
THE FACT THAT SHE MENTIONED 

3653
05:01:19,260 --> 05:01:19,927
THIS YEARS BEFORE MEANS A LOT. 

3654
05:01:19,927 --> 05:01:20,561
BUT YOU COULD HAVE DOUBTERS. 

3655
05:01:20,561 --> 05:01:20,995
I UNDERSTAND THAT. 

3656
05:01:20,995 --> 05:01:21,595
BUT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE AN 

3657
05:01:21,595 --> 05:01:22,196
INVESTIGATION ARE THINGS IN 

3658
05:01:22,196 --> 05:01:22,863
WRITING TO LOOK AT THE FACTS, 

3659
05:01:22,863 --> 05:01:23,197
WHERE ARE WE? 

3660
05:01:23,197 --> 05:01:23,898
I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE. 

3661
05:01:23,898 --> 05:01:24,432
I HAVE BEEN BRIEFED ON 

3662
05:01:24,432 --> 05:01:24,865
BACKGROUND CHECKS. 

3663
05:01:24,865 --> 05:01:25,466
A NUMBER OF TIMES, NOMINEES 

3664
05:01:25,466 --> 05:01:26,133
WOULD DROP BECAUSE OF WHAT IS 

3665
05:01:26,133 --> 05:01:26,734
IN THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS. 

3666
05:01:26,734 --> 05:01:27,401
THE PRESS NEVER KNOWS IT BUT IT 

3667
05:01:27,401 --> 05:01:28,035
HAPPENS. OR SOMETIMES WE ARE 

3668
05:01:28,035 --> 05:01:28,703
PRESENTED WITH INFORMATION THAT 

3669
05:01:28,703 --> 05:01:29,103
IS NOT PUBLIC. 

3670
05:01:29,103 --> 05:01:29,804
DOES THIS AMOUNT TO SOMETHING? 

3671
05:01:29,804 --> 05:01:30,471
DOES LOOK -- LOOKING AT THIS 

3672
05:01:30,471 --> 05:01:31,005
WEBSITE AMOUNT TO THIS? 

3673
05:01:31,005 --> 05:01:31,572
THESE ARE THINGS WE HAVE 

3674
05:01:31,572 --> 05:01:32,039
ACTUALLY CONSIDERED. 

3675
05:01:32,039 --> 05:01:32,673
THAT'S THE KIND OF AFFIRMATION 

3676
05:01:32,673 --> 05:01:33,307
WE GET FROM THOSE BACKGROUND 

3677
05:01:33,307 --> 05:01:33,541
CHECKS. 

3678
05:01:33,541 --> 05:01:34,208
I THINK IT IS A GOOD THING. NOT 

3679
05:01:34,208 --> 05:01:34,842
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE DRAGGED 

3680
05:01:34,842 --> 05:01:35,242
THROUGH THE MUD. 

3681
05:01:35,242 --> 05:01:35,810
LATE MAY WE HAVE ORDER? 

3682
05:01:35,810 --> 05:01:35,976
-- 

3683
05:01:35,976 --> 05:01:36,510
>> MAY WE HAVE ORDER? 

3684
05:01:36,510 --> 05:01:37,211
>> I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN AN 

3685
05:01:37,211 --> 05:01:37,645
EVIDENCE FREEZONE. 

3686
05:01:37,645 --> 05:01:38,245
WE NEED THIS INFORMATION. 

3687
05:01:38,245 --> 05:01:38,879
I WOULD SUBMIT TO MY FRIENDS 

3688
05:01:38,879 --> 05:01:39,580
ACROSS THE AISLE, THIS IS NOT A 

3689
05:01:39,580 --> 05:01:40,047
HE SAID, SHE SAID. 

3690
05:01:40,047 --> 05:01:40,681
THIS IS A HE SAID, THEY SAID. 

3691
05:01:40,681 --> 05:01:41,348
THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO 

3692
05:01:41,348 --> 05:01:41,949
OPEN TALKING ABOUT THE FACT 

3693
05:01:41,949 --> 05:01:42,616
INCLUDING A NOMINEE'S ROOMMATE 

3694
05:01:42,616 --> 05:01:43,284
THAT HE IS BELLIGERENT WHEN HE 

3695
05:01:43,284 --> 05:01:43,617
GETS DRUNK. 

3696
05:01:43,617 --> 05:01:44,318
YES, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. 

3697
05:01:44,318 --> 05:01:44,885
MAYBE HE DOESN'T DO THAT 

3698
05:01:44,885 --> 05:01:45,152
ANYMORE. 

3699
05:01:45,152 --> 05:01:45,820
I KNOW PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL 

3700
05:01:45,820 --> 05:01:46,454
DRINK A LOT AND IN COLLEGE BUT 

3701
05:01:46,454 --> 05:01:47,121
WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THIS, TO TRY 

3702
05:01:47,121 --> 05:01:47,822
TO GET TO THE FACTS, I'M NOT AN 

3703
05:01:47,822 --> 05:01:48,456
FBI AGENT BUT I WAS TRYING TO 

3704
05:01:48,456 --> 05:01:49,123
FIGURE OUT MAYBE HE HAS PARTIAL 

3705
05:01:49,123 --> 05:01:49,824
MEMORY LOSS WHEN HE GETS THAT 

3706
05:01:49,824 --> 05:01:50,491
DRUNK OR MAYBE HE BLACKS OUT. 

3707
05:01:50,491 --> 05:01:50,825
I DON'T KNOW. 

3708
05:01:50,825 --> 05:01:51,392
I WAS TRYING TO GET THAT. 

3709
05:01:51,392 --> 05:01:51,792
WHAT DID I GET? 

3710
05:01:51,792 --> 05:01:52,359
A QUESTION IF I BLACKOUT. 

3711
05:01:52,359 --> 05:01:52,927
DID HE APOLOGIZE? HE DID. 

3712
05:01:52,927 --> 05:01:53,427
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. 

3713
05:01:53,427 --> 05:01:54,061
BUT THE POINT IS, IF WE COULD 

3714
05:01:54,061 --> 05:01:54,729
HAVE THE FBI LIKE WE DO WITH 

3715
05:01:54,729 --> 05:01:55,229
ALL BACKGROUND CHECKS 

3716
05:01:55,229 --> 05:01:55,896
INTERVIEWED THESE WITNESSES, WE 

3717
05:01:55,896 --> 05:01:56,597
COULD GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE 

3718
05:01:56,597 --> 05:01:56,797
FAX. 

3719
05:01:56,797 --> 05:01:57,398
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAID ON FOX 

3720
05:01:57,398 --> 05:01:58,032
NEWS AND YESTERDAY  THAT HE 

3721
05:01:58,032 --> 05:01:58,532
WANTS A FAIR PROCESS. 

3722
05:01:58,532 --> 05:01:59,200
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID HE WANTS. 

3723
05:01:59,200 --> 05:01:59,834
AND WHEN I ASKED THE JUDGE WHY 

3724
05:01:59,834 --> 05:02:00,501
HE WOULDN'T AS THE PRESIDENT TO 

3725
05:02:00,501 --> 05:02:01,068
HAVE THE FBI REOPENED THE 

3726
05:02:01,068 --> 05:02:01,669
INVESTIGATION YESTERDAY, HE 

3727
05:02:01,669 --> 05:02:02,236
DIDN'T MAKE THAT REQUEST. 

3728
05:02:02,236 --> 05:02:02,870
HE DIDN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT 

3729
05:02:02,870 --> 05:02:03,170
QUESTION. 

3730
05:02:03,170 --> 05:02:03,838
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE IN 

3731
05:02:03,838 --> 05:02:04,405
AMERICA RIGHT NOW THAT CAN 

3732
05:02:04,405 --> 05:02:05,005
REOPEN THAT INVESTIGATION. 

3733
05:02:05,005 --> 05:02:05,673
THE ONE SITTING ACROSS THE ROOM 

3734
05:02:05,673 --> 05:02:06,307
BECAUSE YES, SENATOR GRASSLEY 

3735
05:02:06,307 --> 05:02:06,974
COULD HAVE HELD OFF THIS VOTE 

3736
05:02:06,974 --> 05:02:07,408
UNTIL WE HAD THAT 

3737
05:02:07,408 --> 05:02:07,775
INVESTIGATION. 

3738
05:02:07,775 --> 05:02:08,342
JUDGE KAVANAUGH COULD HAVE 

3739
05:02:08,342 --> 05:02:08,976
EASILY SAID FOR THIS TO MOVE 

3740
05:02:08,976 --> 05:02:09,643
FORWARD,  I WANT TO AT LEAST 

3741
05:02:09,643 --> 05:02:10,344
CLEAR MY NAME BUT MOSTLY I WANT 

3742
05:02:10,344 --> 05:02:11,011
TO HAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW

3743
05:02:11,011 --> 05:02:11,712
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS TRUE OR 

3744
05:02:11,712 --> 05:02:11,912
NOT. 

3745
05:02:11,912 --> 05:02:12,446
HE COULD'VE DONE THAT. 

3746
05:02:12,446 --> 05:02:12,947
WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT? 

3747
05:02:12,947 --> 05:02:13,647
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT 

3748
05:02:13,647 --> 05:02:14,148
THEY WILL FIND OUT. 

3749
05:02:14,148 --> 05:02:14,749
YESTERDAY THE AMERICAN BAR 

3750
05:02:14,749 --> 05:02:15,416
ASSOCIATION AND SENATOR DURBIN 

3751
05:02:15,416 --> 05:02:15,983
HAS JUST NOTED AND SENT A 

3752
05:02:15,983 --> 05:02:16,617
LETTER URGING THE COMMITTEE NOT 

3753
05:02:16,617 --> 05:02:17,284
TO VOTE ON THE NOMINATION AND 

3754
05:02:17,284 --> 05:02:17,852
TELL THE FBI HAS CONDUCTED 

3755
05:02:17,852 --> 05:02:18,385
APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-UP. 

3756
05:02:18,385 --> 05:02:19,086
IT MADE THAT REQUEST BECAUSE OF 

3757
05:02:19,086 --> 05:02:19,754
ITS QUOTE, RESPECT FOR THE RULE 

3758
05:02:19,754 --> 05:02:20,421
OF LAW AND DUE PROCESS UNDER LAW

3759
05:02:20,421 --> 05:02:21,055
. I'M JUST WAITING UNTIL THE 

3760
05:02:21,055 --> 05:02:21,655
STAFF IS DONE TALKING OVER 

3761
05:02:21,655 --> 05:02:21,889
THERE. 

3762
05:02:21,889 --> 05:02:22,356
>> I APOLOGIZED -- 

3763
05:02:22,356 --> 05:02:23,023
>> IT MADE THE REQUEST BECAUSE 

3764
05:02:23,023 --> 05:02:23,691
OF ITS RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF 

3765
05:02:23,691 --> 05:02:24,291
LAW AND DUE PROCESS UNDER THE 

3766
05:02:24,291 --> 05:02:24,492
LAW. 

3767
05:02:24,492 --> 05:02:25,025
I CHOSE TO GET ON THIS 

3768
05:02:25,025 --> 05:02:25,326
COMMITTEE. 

3769
05:02:25,326 --> 05:02:25,993
I DIDN'T GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY. 

3770
05:02:25,993 --> 05:02:26,594
I HAD DONE THIS WORK FOR 8 

3771
05:02:26,594 --> 05:02:27,194
YEARS BEFORE I GOT ON HERE. 

3772
05:02:27,194 --> 05:02:27,828
I GOT ON HERE 2 YEARS AFTER I 

3773
05:02:27,828 --> 05:02:28,262
GOT TO THE SENATE. 

3774
05:02:28,262 --> 05:02:28,929
I DECIDED I WANTED TO CONTINUE 

3775
05:02:28,929 --> 05:02:29,263
THAT WORK. 

3776
05:02:29,263 --> 05:02:29,864
TO UPHOLD THE RESPECT FOR THE 

3777
05:02:29,864 --> 05:02:30,431
RULE OF LAW AND DUE PROCESS 

3778
05:02:30,431 --> 05:02:30,798
UNDER THE LAW. 

3779
05:02:30,798 --> 05:02:31,365
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAW 

3780
05:02:31,365 --> 05:02:31,665
YESTERDAY. 

3781
05:02:31,665 --> 05:02:32,233
SO IF THIS COMMITTEE ISN'T 

3782
05:02:32,233 --> 05:02:32,933
GOING TO RESPECT THE LAW AND IF 

3783
05:02:32,933 --> 05:02:33,601
WE GO TO THE FLOOR AND THE SAME 

3784
05:02:33,601 --> 05:02:34,201
THING HAPPENS AGAIN, I WOULD 

3785
05:02:34,201 --> 05:02:34,869
REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE 

3786
05:02:34,869 --> 05:02:35,503
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT SAY WE 

3787
05:02:35,503 --> 05:02:35,936
THE RULING PARTY. 

3788
05:02:35,936 --> 05:02:36,537
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS WE THE 

3789
05:02:36,537 --> 05:02:37,171
PEOPLE. AND IF THE PEOPLE OF 

3790
05:02:37,171 --> 05:02:37,805
THIS COUNTRY WANT TO HAVE A 

3791
05:02:37,805 --> 05:02:38,339
CHECK AND BALANCE IN THE 

3792
05:02:38,339 --> 05:02:38,906
SUPREME COURT, A CHECK AND 

3793
05:02:38,906 --> 05:02:39,573
BALANCE ON THIS ADMINISTRATION, 

3794
05:02:39,573 --> 05:02:40,241
IF THEY WANT A FAIR PROCESS, 

3795
05:02:40,241 --> 05:02:40,941
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT TO 

3796
05:02:40,941 --> 05:02:41,308
PITCH IN HERE. 

3797
05:02:41,308 --> 05:02:42,009
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT TO 

3798
05:02:42,009 --> 05:02:42,343
HAVE A SAY. 

3799
05:02:42,343 --> 05:02:43,010
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THE WAY THIS 

3800
05:02:43,010 --> 05:02:43,611
PROCESS IS RUN, WE ARE NOT 

3801
05:02:43,611 --> 05:02:44,211
RUNNING LIKE WE THE PEOPLE. 

3802
05:02:44,211 --> 05:02:44,845
IT IS BEING RUN LIKE WE THE 

3803
05:02:44,845 --> 05:02:45,212
RULING PARTY. 

3804
05:02:45,212 --> 05:02:45,513
I VOTE NO. 

3805
05:02:45,513 --> 05:02:45,846
>> SENATOR. 

3806
05:02:45,846 --> 05:02:46,514
>> WE HEAR ABOUT FAIR AND OPEN 

3807
05:02:46,514 --> 05:02:47,114
AND THOROUGH AND EVERYTHING 

3808
05:02:47,114 --> 05:02:47,748
THAT I JUST HEARD, WE HEARD 

3809
05:02:47,748 --> 05:02:48,282
INFERENCE OF A POLITICAL 

3810
05:02:48,282 --> 05:02:48,883
STRATEGY ON THE SIDE OF THE 

3811
05:02:48,883 --> 05:02:49,450
AISLE NOT TO BE FAIR AND 

3812
05:02:49,450 --> 05:02:50,151
THOROUGH. I HAVE SEARED IN THE 

3813
05:02:50,151 --> 05:02:50,851
BACK OF MY MIND SOMETHING THAT 

3814
05:02:50,851 --> 05:02:51,552
WAS SAID SOON AFTER JULY 9, THAT

3815
05:02:51,552 --> 05:02:52,219
THE SENATOR SAID THAT TELLS ME 

3816
05:02:52,219 --> 05:02:52,887
ABOUT A POLITICAL STRATEGY THAT 

3817
05:02:52,887 --> 05:02:53,554
IS CARRIED ON HERE, THE WAY IT 

3818
05:02:53,554 --> 05:02:54,121
HAS TO DELAY AND DELAY AND 

3819
05:02:54,121 --> 05:02:54,789
DELAY AND DELAY BECAUSE HE SAID 

3820
05:02:54,789 --> 05:02:55,322
I'M GOING TO FIGHT JUDGE 

3821
05:02:55,322 --> 05:02:55,956
KAVANAUGH 'S NOMINATION WITH 

3822
05:02:55,956 --> 05:02:56,423
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. 

3823
05:02:56,423 --> 05:02:57,124
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT HAS HAPPENED 

3824
05:02:57,124 --> 05:02:57,658
OVER THE LAST 90 DAYS. 

3825
05:02:57,658 --> 05:02:57,925
SENATOR. 

3826
05:02:57,925 --> 05:02:58,559
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

3827
05:02:58,559 --> 05:02:59,260
WE ARE LIVING IN A DIVIDED TIME.

3828
05:02:59,260 --> 05:02:59,894
THIS COUNTRY IS DIVIDED RIGHT 

3829
05:02:59,894 --> 05:03:00,294
DOWN THE MIDDLE. 

3830
05:03:00,294 --> 05:03:00,995
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF 

3831
05:03:00,995 --> 05:03:01,662
ANGER, THERE IS RANGE -- RAGE, 

3832
05:03:01,662 --> 05:03:02,263
HATRED. WE SEE DEMONSTRATORS 

3833
05:03:02,263 --> 05:03:02,963
SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER. THEY 

3834
05:03:02,963 --> 05:03:03,597
REFLECT THAT RAGE, THE ANGER. 

3835
05:03:03,597 --> 05:03:04,231
I KNOW THERE ARE GREAT NUMBER 

3836
05:03:04,231 --> 05:03:04,899
OF AMERICANS WHO WISH WE COULD 

3837
05:03:04,899 --> 05:03:05,566
AND BELIEVE WE CAN GET BACK TO 

3838
05:03:05,566 --> 05:03:06,200
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE TREAT 

3839
05:03:06,200 --> 05:03:06,801
EACH OTHER WITH CIVILITY AND 

3840
05:03:06,801 --> 05:03:07,334
DECENCY, IT BACK TO AN 

3841
05:03:07,334 --> 05:03:07,868
ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE HAVE 

3842
05:03:07,868 --> 05:03:08,536
POLICY DISAGREEMENTS, WE AGREE 

3843
05:03:08,536 --> 05:03:09,203
ON THE RIGHT LEGISLATION AND WE 

3844
05:03:09,203 --> 05:03:09,804
EVEN HAVE VIGOROUS DEBATES 

3845
05:03:09,804 --> 05:03:10,471
ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT POLICY IS. 

3846
05:03:10,471 --> 05:03:11,138
BUT WE DO SO IN A CONTEXT THAT 

3847
05:03:11,138 --> 05:03:11,605
RESPECTS EACH OTHER. 

3848
05:03:11,605 --> 05:03:12,139
THAT DOESN'T DEMEAN THE 

3849
05:03:12,139 --> 05:03:12,673
HUMANITY OF EACH OTHER. 

3850
05:03:12,673 --> 05:03:13,207
THAT DOESN'T ATTACK THE 

3851
05:03:13,207 --> 05:03:13,808
CHARACTER AND DRAG PEOPLE 

3852
05:03:13,808 --> 05:03:14,475
THROUGH THE MUD. THE POLITICS 

3853
05:03:14,475 --> 05:03:15,176
OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION THAT WE 

3854
05:03:15,176 --> 05:03:15,843
HAVE SEEN ON DISPLAY IN RECENT 

3855
05:03:15,843 --> 05:03:16,544
DAYS IS WASHINGTON, D.C. AT ITS 

3856
05:03:16,544 --> 05:03:16,911
VERY UGLIEST. 

3857
05:03:16,911 --> 05:03:17,578
AND ALL OF US SHOULD REMEMBER 

3858
05:03:17,578 --> 05:03:18,245
THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REAL 

3859
05:03:18,245 --> 05:03:18,679
HUMAN BEINGS HERE. 

3860
05:03:18,679 --> 05:03:19,213
THESE AREN'T PONDS IN A 

3861
05:03:19,213 --> 05:03:19,547
CHESSBOARD. 

3862
05:03:19,547 --> 05:03:20,114
-- PAWNS ON A  CHESSBOARD. 

3863
05:03:20,114 --> 05:03:20,781
DR. FORD HAS BEEN THROUGH   I 

3864
05:03:20,781 --> 05:03:21,382
HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS BEEN 

3865
05:03:21,382 --> 05:03:22,016
PAINFUL FOR HER AND HER FAMILY. 

3866
05:03:22,016 --> 05:03:22,616
THE TESTIMONY THAT SHE GAVE 

3867
05:03:22,616 --> 05:03:23,117
YESTERDAY WAS POWERFUL. 

3868
05:03:23,117 --> 05:03:23,784
IT WAS REALLY HEART WRENCHING, 

3869
05:03:23,784 --> 05:03:24,418
IT WAS CLEAR SHE WAS HURTING. 

3870
05:03:24,418 --> 05:03:25,052
HAVING HER NAME MADE PUBLIC 

3871
05:03:25,052 --> 05:03:25,686
AGAINST HER WISHES AND DRAGGED 

3872
05:03:25,686 --> 05:03:26,320
THROUGH THE MUD WAS A HURTFUL 

3873
05:03:26,320 --> 05:03:26,654
THING TO DO. 

3874
05:03:26,654 --> 05:03:27,288
IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO. 

3875
05:03:27,288 --> 05:03:27,888
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH , HE TOO 

3876
05:03:27,888 --> 05:03:28,489
HAS BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH THE 

3877
05:03:28,489 --> 05:03:29,156
MUD FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN A 

3878
05:03:29,156 --> 05:03:29,723
WAY THAT HAS NO PRECEDENT 

3879
05:03:29,723 --> 05:03:30,257
HURRICANE -- PRECEDENT. 

3880
05:03:30,257 --> 05:03:30,958
IT IS ALMOST TRIBAL LYSED -- 

3881
05:03:30,958 --> 05:03:31,292
TRIBALIZED. 

3882
05:03:31,292 --> 05:03:31,926
EVERYTHING WE SEE THROUGH THE 

3883
05:03:31,926 --> 05:03:32,393
LENS OF THE JERSEY. 

3884
05:03:32,393 --> 05:03:33,027
IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF 

3885
05:03:33,027 --> 05:03:33,694
ACROSS THE COUNTRY A SIGNIFICANT

3886
05:03:33,694 --> 05:03:34,328
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ON THE 

3887
05:03:34,328 --> 05:03:34,962
DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE AISLE 

3888
05:03:34,962 --> 05:03:35,563
SIDE YESTERDAY WAS TESTIMONY 

3889
05:03:35,563 --> 05:03:36,197
AND CONCLUDED -- YESTERDAY'S 

3890
05:03:36,197 --> 05:03:36,897
TESTIMONY AND CONCLUDED HE MUST 

3891
05:03:36,897 --> 05:03:37,198
BE GUILTY. 

3892
05:03:37,198 --> 05:03:37,865
ANYONE SURPRISE ME IF THOSE ON 

3893
05:03:37,865 --> 05:03:38,499
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE CONCLUDED 

3894
05:03:38,499 --> 05:03:38,999
HE MUST BE INNOCENT. 

3895
05:03:38,999 --> 05:03:39,700
ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT 

3896
05:03:39,700 --> 05:03:40,301
-- JUDGE KAVANAUGH  TALKED 

3897
05:03:40,301 --> 05:03:40,901
ABOUT HOW THE SMEARS AND THE 

3898
05:03:40,901 --> 05:03:41,502
MANY THAT HAVE BEEN LEVELED 

3899
05:03:41,502 --> 05:03:42,102
AGAINST HIM IN THE LAST TWO 

3900
05:03:42,102 --> 05:03:42,670
WEEKS AS HE PUT IT, HAVE 

3901
05:03:42,670 --> 05:03:43,170
DESTROYED HIS FAMILY. 

3902
05:03:43,170 --> 05:03:43,804
TO SOME THAT MAY SOUND LIKE 

3903
05:03:43,804 --> 05:03:44,104
HYPERBOLE. 

3904
05:03:44,104 --> 05:03:44,572
I DON'T THINK IT IS. 

3905
05:03:44,572 --> 05:03:45,239
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS  TWO YOUNG 

3906
05:03:45,239 --> 05:03:45,539
DAUGHTERS. 

3907
05:03:45,539 --> 05:03:46,173
A 10-YEAR-OLD AND A 13-YEAR-OLD.

3908
05:03:46,173 --> 05:03:46,807
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES, 

3909
05:03:46,807 --> 05:03:47,508
THEIR DAUGHTERS OR GO TO SCHOOL 

3910
05:03:47,508 --> 05:03:48,175
AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE, MANY 

3911
05:03:48,175 --> 05:03:48,809
OF WHOM ARE CONVINCED THEIR 

3912
05:03:48,809 --> 05:03:49,243
FATHER IS A RAPIST. 

3913
05:03:49,243 --> 05:03:49,844
I WANT YOU TO THINK OF THE 

3914
05:03:49,844 --> 05:03:50,511
EFFECT THAT HAS WHEN THOSE ARE 

3915
05:03:50,511 --> 05:03:50,911
THE ALLEGATIONS. 

3916
05:03:50,911 --> 05:03:51,445
THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS. 

3917
05:03:51,445 --> 05:03:52,046
NOT I THINK YOU ARE WRONG ON 

3918
05:03:52,046 --> 05:03:52,513
HOW YOU INTERPRET THE 

3919
05:03:52,513 --> 05:03:53,147
CONSTITUTION -- AND LET'S BE 

3920
05:03:53,147 --> 05:03:53,814
CLEAR, HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF 

3921
05:03:53,814 --> 05:03:54,248
AMONG OTHER THINGS 

3922
05:03:54,248 --> 05:03:54,849
PARTICIPATING IN REPEATEDLY 

3923
05:03:54,849 --> 05:03:55,516
DRUGGING AND GANG RAPING WOMEN 

3924
05:03:55,516 --> 05:03:56,183
TO TAKE SOME OF THE LUDICROUS 

3925
05:03:56,183 --> 05:03:56,784
CLAIMS THAT OF BEEN ERRED. 

3926
05:03:56,784 --> 05:03:57,451
THESE LITTLE GIRLS ARE GOING TO 

3927
05:03:57,451 --> 05:03:58,052
HAVE CLASSMATES REPEAT THOSE 

3928
05:03:58,052 --> 05:03:58,452
CHARGES TO THEM. 

3929
05:03:58,452 --> 05:03:59,053
SOME OF THE MOST POIGNANT 

3930
05:03:59,053 --> 05:03:59,687
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY WAS WHEN 

3931
05:03:59,687 --> 05:04:00,321
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DESCRIBED  HOW 

3932
05:04:00,321 --> 05:04:00,955
HE HAS TAUGHT LAW FOR OVER A 

3933
05:04:00,955 --> 05:04:01,655
DECADE AND HE SAID HE MAY NEVER 

3934
05:04:01,655 --> 05:04:02,189
GET TO TEACH LAW AGAIN. 

3935
05:04:02,189 --> 05:04:02,823
AND THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. 

3936
05:04:02,823 --> 05:04:03,490
THAT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE EVEN 

3937
05:04:03,490 --> 05:04:04,024
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH  IS 

3938
05:04:04,024 --> 05:04:04,692
CONFIRMED AS A SITTING JUSTICE. 

3939
05:04:04,692 --> 05:04:05,326
I'M A GRADUATE OF THE HARVARD 

3940
05:04:05,326 --> 05:04:05,593
SCHOOL. 

3941
05:04:05,593 --> 05:04:06,260
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THOSE ON 

3942
05:04:06,260 --> 05:04:06,861
THE LEFT WOULD SAY WE DON'T 

3943
05:04:06,861 --> 05:04:07,494
WANT SOMEONE WE BELIEVE IS A 

3944
05:04:07,494 --> 05:04:08,128
RAPIST EVER TEACHING AGAIN. 

3945
05:04:08,128 --> 05:04:08,762
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH 

3946
05:04:08,762 --> 05:04:09,330
HE IS LOVED -- HAS LOVED 

3947
05:04:09,330 --> 05:04:09,930
COACHING GIRLS BASKETBALL. 

3948
05:04:09,930 --> 05:04:10,598
HE MENTIONED HE MAY NEVER COACH 

3949
05:04:10,598 --> 05:04:10,831
AGAIN. 

3950
05:04:10,831 --> 05:04:11,465
THAT'S A VERY REAL POSSIBLE 

3951
05:04:11,465 --> 05:04:12,132
CONSEQUENCE OF THE MUDSLINGING 

3952
05:04:12,132 --> 05:04:12,766
AND IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR OF 

3953
05:04:12,766 --> 05:04:13,234
THE LAST TWO WEEKS. 

3954
05:04:13,234 --> 05:04:13,934
IT MAY WELL BE IN THIS DIVIDED 

3955
05:04:13,934 --> 05:04:14,602
WORLD THAT THE PARENTS OF THE 

3956
05:04:14,602 --> 05:04:15,236
OTHER GIRLS SAY WE DON'T WANT 

3957
05:04:15,236 --> 05:04:15,769
HIM AS A COACH ANYMORE. 

3958
05:04:15,769 --> 05:04:16,437
WORLDS AND -- WORDS AND ACTIONS 

3959
05:04:16,437 --> 05:04:16,871
HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 

3960
05:04:16,871 --> 05:04:17,504
THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS A 

3961
05:04:17,504 --> 05:04:17,872
PARTISAN TIME. 

3962
05:04:17,872 --> 05:04:18,505
I HAVE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN 

3963
05:04:18,505 --> 05:04:18,772
PEOPLE. 

3964
05:04:18,772 --> 05:04:19,473
I HAVE FAITH IN THE PEOPLE THAT 

3965
05:04:19,473 --> 05:04:20,074
WE WANT TO BE FAIR-MINDED. 

3966
05:04:20,074 --> 05:04:20,808
WE WANT TO ASSESS WHAT HAPPENS. 

3967
05:04:20,808 --> 05:04:21,442
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT ONCE 

3968
05:04:21,442 --> 05:04:22,076
THESE BECAME PUBLIC THAT DR. 

3969
05:04:22,076 --> 05:04:22,776
FORD WAS GIVEN A FULL  AND FAIR 

3970
05:04:22,776 --> 05:04:23,444
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HER STORY. 

3971
05:04:23,444 --> 05:04:24,111
I URGED MY COLLEAGUES THAT WAS 

3972
05:04:24,111 --> 05:04:24,812
THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO GIVE 

3973
05:04:24,812 --> 05:04:25,446
HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY 

3974
05:04:25,446 --> 05:04:25,746
IN PUBLIC. 

3975
05:04:25,746 --> 05:04:26,413
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT SHE BE 

3976
05:04:26,413 --> 05:04:27,047
GIVEN A FAIR AND RESPECTFUL 

3977
05:04:27,047 --> 05:04:27,381
ENVIRONMENT. 

3978
05:04:27,381 --> 05:04:28,015
THAT SHE NOT BE DEMEANED OR 

3979
05:04:28,015 --> 05:04:28,282
ATTACKED. 

3980
05:04:28,282 --> 05:04:28,949
AND SHE WAS NOT HURRICANE THAT 

3981
05:04:28,949 --> 05:04:29,516
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 

3982
05:04:29,516 --> 05:04:30,150
THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS TO 

3983
05:04:30,150 --> 05:04:30,784
GIVE HER A PUBLIC FORUM AND A 

3984
05:04:30,784 --> 05:04:31,418
FULL PUBLIC FORUM TO TELL HER 

3985
05:04:31,418 --> 05:04:31,652
STORY. 

3986
05:04:31,652 --> 05:04:32,186
BUT THE RIGHT THING ALSO 

3987
05:04:32,186 --> 05:04:32,720
REQUIRES -- AND WE SAW 

3988
05:04:32,720 --> 05:04:33,320
YESTERDAY, JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

3989
05:04:33,320 --> 05:04:33,821
GIVEN A FULL AND FAIR 

3990
05:04:33,821 --> 05:04:34,521
OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND HIMSELF. 

3991
05:04:34,521 --> 05:04:35,122
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WATCHED 

3992
05:04:35,122 --> 05:04:35,723
THAT TESTIMONY. AND YOU COME 

3993
05:04:35,723 --> 05:04:36,257
AWAY WITH A NUMBER OF 

3994
05:04:36,257 --> 05:04:36,590
CONCLUSIONS. 

3995
05:04:36,590 --> 05:04:37,291
IT IS CLEAR THE TESTIMONY IS IN 

3996
05:04:37,291 --> 05:04:37,691
DIRECT CONFLICT. 

3997
05:04:37,691 --> 05:04:38,225
WHAT THEY SAID IS CORRECT 

3998
05:04:38,225 --> 05:04:38,626
>> CONFLICTING. 

3999
05:04:38,626 --> 05:04:39,293
JUDGE KAVANAUGH  CATEGORICALLY 

4000
05:04:39,293 --> 05:04:39,827
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS. 

4001
05:04:39,827 --> 05:04:40,427
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO YOU 

4002
05:04:40,427 --> 05:04:40,995
RESOLVE THAT DISCREPANCY? 

4003
05:04:40,995 --> 05:04:41,528
HOW DOES THE COMMITTEE? 

4004
05:04:41,528 --> 05:04:41,962
HOW DOES A SENATE? 

4005
05:04:41,962 --> 05:04:42,563
HOW DID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

4006
05:04:42,563 --> 05:04:43,230
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO 

4007
05:04:43,230 --> 05:04:43,898
TESTIFIED TO THINGS THAT ARE 

4008
05:04:43,898 --> 05:04:44,598
OPPOSED? THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO 

4009
05:04:44,598 --> 05:04:45,199
DO IT  AND THIS IS HOW A 

4010
05:04:45,199 --> 05:04:45,866
COURT OF LAW OPERATES AND MOST 

4011
05:04:45,866 --> 05:04:46,533
REASONABLE OPERATE, YOU LOOK TO 

4012
05:04:46,533 --> 05:04:47,268
WATERS -- WHAT DOES THE REST OF 

4013
05:04:47,268 --> 05:04:47,835
THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATE? 

4014
05:04:47,835 --> 05:04:48,402
WHAT DOES IT DEMONSTRATE? 

4015
05:04:48,402 --> 05:04:49,136
DR. FORD  NAMED THREE WITNESSES.

4016
05:04:49,136 --> 05:04:49,770
SHE SAYS THEY WERE THERE AND 

4017
05:04:49,770 --> 05:04:50,404
COULD CORROBARATE  THE STORY. 

4018
05:04:50,404 --> 05:04:51,105
NONE OF THE THREE SENATOR LEAHY 

4019
05:04:51,105 --> 05:04:51,438
THE STORY.  

4020
05:04:51,438 --> 05:04:52,006
ALL THREE OF THE WITNESSES 

4021
05:04:52,006 --> 05:04:52,640
EXPLICITLY REFUTED HER STORY. 

4022
05:04:52,640 --> 05:04:53,274
AND THEY DID SO UNDER PENALTY 

4023
05:04:53,274 --> 05:04:53,941
OF PERJURY. THEY DIDN'T DO SO 

4024
05:04:53,941 --> 05:04:54,208
LIGHTLY. 

4025
05:04:54,208 --> 05:04:54,742
THEY DIDN'T JUST SAY IT. 

4026
05:04:54,742 --> 05:04:55,409
THEY DID IT IN A CONTEXT UNDER 

4027
05:04:55,409 --> 05:04:56,110
THE CODE THEY CAN FACE UP TO 5 

4028
05:04:56,110 --> 05:04:56,810
YEARS IN PRISON IF THEY LIE TO 

4029
05:04:56,810 --> 05:04:57,177
THE COMMITTEE. 

4030
05:04:57,177 --> 05:04:57,811
SO EVERY SINGLE FACT WITNESS 

4031
05:04:57,811 --> 05:04:58,379
THAT DR. FORD  NAMED HAS 

4032
05:04:58,379 --> 05:04:58,946
DISPUTED HER ALLEGATIONS. 

4033
05:04:58,946 --> 05:04:59,513
NOW, ONE OF THOSE PERFECT 

4034
05:04:59,513 --> 05:05:00,047
WITNESSES WAS MR. JUDGE. 

4035
05:05:00,047 --> 05:05:00,547
WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 

4036
05:05:00,547 --> 05:05:01,148
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MR. JUDGE. 

4037
05:05:01,148 --> 05:05:01,815
A LOT OF THE COLLEAGUES SAYING 

4038
05:05:01,815 --> 05:05:02,449
WHY DIDN'T WE HEAR TESTIMONY 

4039
05:05:02,449 --> 05:05:02,850
FROM MR. JUDGE? 

4040
05:05:02,850 --> 05:05:03,517
WELL, MR. JUDGE REFUSED TO TALK 

4041
05:05:03,517 --> 05:05:03,951
TO THE COMMITTEE. 

4042
05:05:03,951 --> 05:05:04,551
HE SUBMITTED A STATEMENT, A 

4043
05:05:04,551 --> 05:05:05,119
STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF 

4044
05:05:05,119 --> 05:05:05,686
PERJURY, UNDER PENALTY OF 

4045
05:05:05,686 --> 05:05:06,387
FENNEL THE -- FELONY, BUT IT IS 

4046
05:05:06,387 --> 05:05:07,021
NOT COMPETENT TO UNDERSTAND 

4047
05:05:07,021 --> 05:05:07,221
WHY. 

4048
05:05:07,221 --> 05:05:07,821
PUBLIC RECORD INDICATES MR. 

4049
05:05:07,821 --> 05:05:08,455
JUDGE HAS HAD A TROUBLED LIFE. 

4050
05:05:08,455 --> 05:05:09,089
HE HAS BATTLED WITH ADDICTION 

4051
05:05:09,089 --> 05:05:09,590
FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE. 

4052
05:05:09,590 --> 05:05:10,257
WE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT HE HAS 

4053
05:05:10,257 --> 05:05:10,658
BEEN NEAR BATH. 

4054
05:05:10,658 --> 05:05:11,258
-- DEATH. HE IS A CANCER 

4055
05:05:11,258 --> 05:05:11,558
SURVIVOR. 

4056
05:05:11,558 --> 05:05:12,159
HE HAS ALSO BEEN DIRECTLY 

4057
05:05:12,159 --> 05:05:12,860
ACCUSED OF MULTIPLE FELONIES. 

4058
05:05:12,860 --> 05:05:13,560
SO WHEN INVESTIGATORS ASKED TO 

4059
05:05:13,560 --> 05:05:14,161
INTERVIEW HIM, HE SAID NO. 

4060
05:05:14,161 --> 05:05:14,828
THAT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE ANYBODY.

4061
05:05:14,828 --> 05:05:15,496
WE HAD A VOTE EARLIER TODAY ON 

4062
05:05:15,496 --> 05:05:15,896
SUBPOENAING HIM. 

4063
05:05:15,896 --> 05:05:16,563
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED WHAT WOULD 

4064
05:05:16,563 --> 05:05:17,197
HAPPEN IF YOU WERE SUBPOENAED. 

4065
05:05:17,197 --> 05:05:17,731
IF HE CAME BEFORE THIS 

4066
05:05:17,731 --> 05:05:18,365
COMMITTEE, ANY DEFENSE LAWYER 

4067
05:05:18,365 --> 05:05:18,966
WOULD TELL MR. JUDGE NOT TO 

4068
05:05:18,966 --> 05:05:19,233
TESTIFY. 

4069
05:05:19,233 --> 05:05:19,767
I UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY 

4070
05:05:19,767 --> 05:05:20,401
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS WOULD VERY 

4071
05:05:20,401 --> 05:05:21,035
MUCH LIKE TO SEE A MAN WHO 

4072
05:05:21,035 --> 05:05:21,669
STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION MOST 

4073
05:05:21,669 --> 05:05:22,369
OF HIS LIFE SITTING BEFORE THIS 

4074
05:05:22,369 --> 05:05:22,937
COMMITTEE AND PLEADING THE 

4075
05:05:22,937 --> 05:05:23,170
FIFTH. 

4076
05:05:23,170 --> 05:05:23,671
THAT WOULD MAKE GREAT 

4077
05:05:23,671 --> 05:05:23,971
THEATRICS. 

4078
05:05:23,971 --> 05:05:24,638
THAT WOULD MAKE GREAT POLITICAL 

4079
05:05:24,638 --> 05:05:24,939
THEATRICS. 

4080
05:05:24,939 --> 05:05:25,572
IT WOULDN'T HELP ONE IOTA IN 

4081
05:05:25,572 --> 05:05:26,140
THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH. 

4082
05:05:26,140 --> 05:05:26,707
BUT IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT 

4083
05:05:26,707 --> 05:05:27,041
PUBLIC SHOW. 

4084
05:05:27,041 --> 05:05:27,641
AND I WILL SAY OF THE THREE 

4085
05:05:27,641 --> 05:05:28,242
FACT WITNESSES, THE ONE WHO I 

4086
05:05:28,242 --> 05:05:28,842
THINK IS MOST REVEALING IS 

4087
05:05:28,842 --> 05:05:29,476
LEGAL IN KAISER. -- LELAND 

4088
05:05:29,476 --> 05:05:29,743
KAISER. 

4089
05:05:29,743 --> 05:05:30,377
MS. KAISER HAD EVERY INCENTIVE 

4090
05:05:30,377 --> 05:05:30,878
TO BACK UP HER STORY. 

4091
05:05:30,878 --> 05:05:31,445
INSTEAD, MS. KAISER UNDER 

4092
05:05:31,445 --> 05:05:32,079
PENALTY OF PERJURY SAYS SHE 

4093
05:05:32,079 --> 05:05:32,713
DOESN'T KNOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

4094
05:05:32,713 --> 05:05:33,380
AND SHE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF 

4095
05:05:33,380 --> 05:05:34,048
ANY PARTY LIKE THE ONE DR. FORD 

4096
05:05:34,048 --> 05:05:34,748
DESCRIBES.  DR. FORD TESTIFIED  

4097
05:05:34,748 --> 05:05:35,349
THAT MS. KAISER TEXTED HER 

4098
05:05:35,349 --> 05:05:36,016
AFTER SUBMITTING THAT STATEMENT 

4099
05:05:36,016 --> 05:05:36,684
TO SAY SHE WAS SORRY, SORRY FOR 

4100
05:05:36,684 --> 05:05:37,251
NOT BACKING UP HER STORY. 

4101
05:05:37,251 --> 05:05:37,751
I THINK THAT INDICATES 

4102
05:05:37,751 --> 05:05:38,419
POWERFULLY THAT HER INCENTIVES 

4103
05:05:38,419 --> 05:05:39,119
IF AT ALL POSSIBLE WORK TO BACK 

4104
05:05:39,119 --> 05:05:39,820
UP THE STORY AND YET SHE DIDN'T 

4105
05:05:39,820 --> 05:05:40,220
FEEL SHE COULD. 

4106
05:05:40,220 --> 05:05:40,821
SHE HAD NO MOTIVE TO LIE. 

4107
05:05:40,821 --> 05:05:41,455
EVERY INCENTIVE TO AGREE WITH 

4108
05:05:41,455 --> 05:05:42,122
DR. FORD'S  STORY AND YET SHE 

4109
05:05:42,122 --> 05:05:42,523
DID NOT DO SO. 

4110
05:05:42,523 --> 05:05:43,123
SO ALL THREE FACT WITNESSES 

4111
05:05:43,123 --> 05:05:43,757
HAVE EXPLICITLY DISPUTED THE 

4112
05:05:43,757 --> 05:05:44,091
ALLEGATIONS. 

4113
05:05:44,091 --> 05:05:44,792
WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE? 

4114
05:05:44,792 --> 05:05:45,392
WE HAVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  

4115
05:05:45,392 --> 05:05:45,693
CALENDARS. 

4116
05:05:45,693 --> 05:05:46,393
I HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN THEY WERE 

4117
05:05:46,393 --> 05:05:46,961
FIRST RELEASED THERE WERE 

4118
05:05:46,961 --> 05:05:47,394
STORIES ABOUT THEM. 

4119
05:05:47,394 --> 05:05:48,062
I DIDN'T FIND THAT PERSUASIVE 

4120
05:05:48,062 --> 05:05:48,329
EVIDENCE. 

4121
05:05:48,329 --> 05:05:48,963
UNTIL JUDGE KAVANAUGH  WALKED 

4122
05:05:48,963 --> 05:05:49,663
THROUGH DAY BY DAY EACH OF THE 

4123
05:05:49,663 --> 05:05:50,297
POSSIBLE DAYS WHEN THIS WAS 

4124
05:05:50,297 --> 05:05:50,898
ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENE AND 

4125
05:05:50,898 --> 05:05:51,498
WALKED THROUGH THE SPECIFIC 

4126
05:05:51,498 --> 05:05:52,199
CONFLICT HOW HE WAS OUT OF TOWN 

4127
05:05:52,199 --> 05:05:52,700
FOR MANY OF THE DAYS. 

4128
05:05:52,700 --> 05:05:53,334
HAD CONFLICTS FOR MANY OF THE 

4129
05:05:53,334 --> 05:05:53,534
DAYS. 

4130
05:05:53,534 --> 05:05:54,134
THE NOTIONS THAT THEY WERE 

4131
05:05:54,134 --> 05:05:54,835
ALMOST LIKE DIARIES IS KIND OF 

4132
05:05:54,835 --> 05:05:55,035
ODD. 

4133
05:05:55,035 --> 05:05:55,602
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING MANY 

4134
05:05:55,602 --> 05:05:56,236
PEOPLE DO BUT IT IS SOMETHING 

4135
05:05:56,236 --> 05:05:56,837
HE AND HIS FATHER BOTH DO. 

4136
05:05:56,837 --> 05:05:57,471
THAT EVIDENCE THAT HE KEPT IN 

4137
05:05:57,471 --> 05:05:58,172
1982 -- THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE 

4138
05:05:58,172 --> 05:05:58,806
WOULD BE POWERFUL IN COURT. 

4139
05:05:58,806 --> 05:05:59,440
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ASCERTAIN 

4140
05:05:59,440 --> 05:06:00,074
TWO CONFLICTING WITNESSES, YOU 

4141
05:06:00,074 --> 05:06:00,607
LOOK FOR CONTEMPORANEOUS 

4142
05:06:00,607 --> 05:06:01,275
EVIDENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. 

4143
05:06:01,275 --> 05:06:01,875
AND FINALLY, WE KNOW JUDGE 

4144
05:06:01,875 --> 05:06:02,543
KAVANAUGH'S  IMPECCABLE RECORD 

4145
05:06:02,543 --> 05:06:03,177
OF DECADES OF PUBLIC SERVICE. 

4146
05:06:03,177 --> 05:06:03,644
HE IS 53 YEARS OLD. 

4147
05:06:03,644 --> 05:06:04,244
AND PRIOR TO TWO WEEKS AGO, 

4148
05:06:04,244 --> 05:06:04,912
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ALLEGATIONS 

4149
05:06:04,912 --> 05:06:05,479
WHATSOEVER OF THIS KIND. 

4150
05:06:05,479 --> 05:06:06,046
SIX FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS, 

4151
05:06:06,046 --> 05:06:06,680
NOBODY RAISED ANY CLAIM LIKE 

4152
05:06:06,680 --> 05:06:06,880
THIS. 

4153
05:06:06,880 --> 05:06:07,548
NOW ALL OF US KNOW FROM HUMAN 

4154
05:06:07,548 --> 05:06:08,248
EXPERIENCE THAT IF SOMEONE IS A 

4155
05:06:08,248 --> 05:06:08,916
SEXUAL PREDATOR, IF SOMEONE IS 

4156
05:06:08,916 --> 05:06:09,483
COMMITTING THESE KINDS OF 

4157
05:06:09,483 --> 05:06:10,150
ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLEGED, 

4158
05:06:10,150 --> 05:06:10,851
THAT IT IS VERY RARE THAT THEY 

4159
05:06:10,851 --> 05:06:11,385
ARE A ONE TIME OFFENDER. 

4160
05:06:11,385 --> 05:06:12,086
IF SOMEONE IS CARRYING OUT THIS 

4161
05:06:12,086 --> 05:06:12,753
KIND OF CONDUCT, THEY TYPICALLY 

4162
05:06:12,753 --> 05:06:13,454
HAVE A PATTERN OF DOING SO OVER 

4163
05:06:13,454 --> 05:06:14,021
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 

4164
05:06:14,021 --> 05:06:14,655
WE HAVE SEEN POWERFUL MEN IN 

4165
05:06:14,655 --> 05:06:15,255
POLITICS AND HOLLYWOOD WHOSE 

4166
05:06:15,255 --> 05:06:15,956
CAREERS HAVE BEEN RIGHTLY ENDED 

4167
05:06:15,956 --> 05:06:16,623
BUT FOR A PATTERN OF HARASSMENT 

4168
05:06:16,623 --> 05:06:17,157
AND ABUSE THAT TYPICALLY 

4169
05:06:17,157 --> 05:06:17,558
EXTENDS DECADES. 

4170
05:06:17,558 --> 05:06:18,225
WHEN SOMEONE BEHAVES LIKE THIS, 

4171
05:06:18,225 --> 05:06:18,892
THEY BEHAVE LIKE THIS OVER AND 

4172
05:06:18,892 --> 05:06:19,226
OVER AGAIN. 

4173
05:06:19,226 --> 05:06:19,927
THERE IS NO CREDIBLE INDICATION 

4174
05:06:19,927 --> 05:06:20,494
THAT THAT HAS OCCURRED. 

4175
05:06:20,494 --> 05:06:21,195
INDEED, IT IS STRIKING THAT IN 

4176
05:06:21,195 --> 05:06:21,895
HIS 12 YEARS AS A FEDERAL JUDGE 

4177
05:06:21,895 --> 05:06:22,596
MAJORITY OF HIS LAW CLERKS HAVE 

4178
05:06:22,596 --> 05:06:22,930
BEEN WOMEN. 

4179
05:06:22,930 --> 05:06:23,564
THAT IS EXCEPTIONALLY UNUSUAL. 

4180
05:06:23,564 --> 05:06:24,131
I DO NOT KNOW OF ANOTHER 

4181
05:06:24,131 --> 05:06:24,732
FEDERAL APPELLATE JUDGE FOR 

4182
05:06:24,732 --> 05:06:25,265
WHOM THAT IS THE CASE. 

4183
05:06:25,265 --> 05:06:25,899
I CAN TELL YOU HIS LAW CLERKS 

4184
05:06:25,899 --> 05:06:26,233
REVERE HIM. 

4185
05:06:26,233 --> 05:06:26,800
THEY HOLD HIM IN THE VERY 

4186
05:06:26,800 --> 05:06:27,267
HIGHEST OF RESPECT. 

4187
05:06:27,267 --> 05:06:27,968
HIS REPUTATION IN THIS TOWN IS 

4188
05:06:27,968 --> 05:06:28,469
OF BEING A BOY SCOUT. 

4189
05:06:28,469 --> 05:06:29,069
IT IS OF BEING A BORING BOY 

4190
05:06:29,069 --> 05:06:29,670
SCOUT. THAT HAS BEEN HIS 

4191
05:06:29,670 --> 05:06:30,237
REPUTATION FOR LONG TIME. 

4192
05:06:30,237 --> 05:06:30,938
NOW, SOME MIGHT SAY, THERE HAVE 

4193
05:06:30,938 --> 05:06:31,572
BEEN THESE OTHER SENSATIONAL 

4194
05:06:31,572 --> 05:06:31,905
ALLEGATIONS. 

4195
05:06:31,905 --> 05:06:32,573
WE HAVE SEEN OTHERS THAT HAVE 

4196
05:06:32,573 --> 05:06:33,140
POPPED UP AFTER THIS ONE. 

4197
05:06:33,140 --> 05:06:33,707
I THOUGHT IT WAS STRIKING 

4198
05:06:33,707 --> 05:06:34,308
YESTERDAY THAT NOT A SINGLE 

4199
05:06:34,308 --> 05:06:34,975
DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CHOSE TO ASK 

4200
05:06:34,975 --> 05:06:35,476
ABOUT ANY OF THE OTHER 

4201
05:06:35,476 --> 05:06:35,809
ALLEGATIONS. 

4202
05:06:35,809 --> 05:06:36,377
I THINK THAT INDICATES HOW 

4203
05:06:36,377 --> 05:06:37,011
LITTLE CREDIBILITY THERE IS 

4204
05:06:37,011 --> 05:06:37,578
BEHIND THOSE ALLEGATIONS. 

4205
05:06:37,578 --> 05:06:38,145
THE ONE THAT IS THE MOST 

4206
05:06:38,145 --> 05:06:38,779
SENSATIONAL BY THE CLIENT OF 

4207
05:06:38,779 --> 05:06:39,279
MICHAEL AVENATTI MAKES 

4208
05:06:39,279 --> 05:06:39,847
EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS WHICH 

4209
05:06:39,847 --> 05:06:40,481
APPARENTLY THE COLLEAGUES ARE 

4210
05:06:40,481 --> 05:06:41,081
EMBARRASSED TO SAY PUBLICLY 

4211
05:06:41,081 --> 05:06:41,715
BECAUSE THEY DEMONSTRATE THIS 

4212
05:06:41,715 --> 05:06:42,216
IS A PARTISAN CIRCUS. 

4213
05:06:42,216 --> 05:06:42,783
IT IS NOT ABOUT SUBSTANCE. 

4214
05:06:42,783 --> 05:06:43,283
THIS IS ABOUT SMEARS. 

4215
05:06:43,283 --> 05:06:43,951
>> COULD I ASKED THE SENATOR TO 

4216
05:06:43,951 --> 05:06:44,251
SUM IT UP? 

4217
05:06:44,251 --> 05:06:44,952
THE REASON I HAVE DONE THAT IS 

4218
05:06:44,952 --> 05:06:45,586
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE 

4219
05:06:45,586 --> 05:06:46,220
EVERYBODY A CHANCE TO SPEAK. 

4220
05:06:46,220 --> 05:06:46,920
>> THIS COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN DR. 

4221
05:06:46,920 --> 05:06:47,521
FORD AND  JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

4222
05:06:47,521 --> 05:06:48,155
AFFAIR OPPORTUNITY TO LAY OUT 

4223
05:06:48,155 --> 05:06:48,489
THEIR VIEWS. 

4224
05:06:48,489 --> 05:06:49,123
AND I WILL SAY, UNFORTUNATELY, 

4225
05:06:49,123 --> 05:06:49,757
THE CONDUCT OF THE DEMOCRATIC 

4226
05:06:49,757 --> 05:06:50,391
COLLEAGUES, IT HAS BEEN CLEAR 

4227
05:06:50,391 --> 05:06:51,025
THAT THIS HAS ALL BEEN ABOUT 

4228
05:06:51,025 --> 05:06:51,625
POLITICS AND DELAYING THIS 

4229
05:06:51,625 --> 05:06:52,226
CONFIRMATION UNTIL AFTER THE 

4230
05:06:52,226 --> 05:06:52,860
ELECTION, HOPING THEY WIN THE 

4231
05:06:52,860 --> 05:06:53,560
SENATE IN THE ELECTION AND THEN 

4232
05:06:53,560 --> 05:06:54,194
KEEPING THE SEAT VACANT UNTIL 

4233
05:06:54,194 --> 05:06:54,428
2021. 

4234
05:06:54,428 --> 05:06:55,095
EVERY DEMOCRATIC MEMBER BEFORE 

4235
05:06:55,095 --> 05:06:55,763
THE CONFIRMATION HEARING STARTED

4236
05:06:55,763 --> 05:06:56,296
SAID THEY OPPOSED JUDGE 

4237
05:06:56,296 --> 05:06:56,897
KAVANAUGH  BEFORE A SINGLE 

4238
05:06:56,897 --> 05:06:57,264
THING STARTED. 

4239
05:06:57,264 --> 05:06:57,798
AND NOT ONLY THAT, THIS 

4240
05:06:57,798 --> 05:06:58,465
ALLEGATION -- THEY HAD IT IN 

4241
05:06:58,465 --> 05:06:58,899
WRITING ON JULY 30. 

4242
05:06:58,899 --> 05:06:59,533
IF THAT HAD BEEN REPORTED TO 

4243
05:06:59,533 --> 05:07:00,034
THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. 

4244
05:07:00,034 --> 05:07:00,501
WE HAVE A PROCESS TO 

4245
05:07:00,501 --> 05:07:00,968
INVESTIGATE THAT IS 

4246
05:07:00,968 --> 05:07:01,301
CONFIDENTIAL.

4247
05:07:01,301 --> 05:07:01,969
>> THAT'S THE WAY THIS PROCESS 

4248
05:07:01,969 --> 05:07:02,536
SHOULD'VE WORKED AND THAT 

4249
05:07:02,536 --> 05:07:03,137
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY FROM DR. 

4250
05:07:03,137 --> 05:07:03,804
FORD  IS THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO 

4251
05:07:03,804 --> 05:07:04,471
HAD COPIES OF THE LETTER WERE 

4252
05:07:04,471 --> 05:07:04,972
HERSELF, THE LAWYERS, 

4253
05:07:04,972 --> 05:07:05,606
REPRESENTATIVE ESHOO , AND THE 

4254
05:07:05,606 --> 05:07:06,006
RANKING MEMBER. 

4255
05:07:06,006 --> 05:07:06,573
NEITHER SHE NOR HER LAWYERS 

4256
05:07:06,573 --> 05:07:07,107
HANDED THE LETTER OVER. 

4257
05:07:07,107 --> 05:07:07,775
THAT LEADS THE ONLY CONCLUSION 

4258
05:07:07,775 --> 05:07:08,442
POSSIBLE IS IT WAS THE -- LEAKED

4259
05:07:08,442 --> 05:07:09,143
TO THE MEMBER S OF CONGRESS OR 

4260
05:07:09,143 --> 05:07:09,810
TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO THEY GAVE 

4261
05:07:09,810 --> 05:07:09,977
IT. 

4262
05:07:09,977 --> 05:07:10,677
IF THERE ARE ONLY FOUR PEOPLE IN

4263
05:07:10,677 --> 05:07:11,311
TWO DID NOT GIVE IT THAN THE 

4264
05:07:11,311 --> 05:07:11,979
OTHER TWO ARE THE ONLY POSSIBLE 

4265
05:07:11,979 --> 05:07:12,246
SOURCES. 

4266
05:07:12,246 --> 05:07:12,746
AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY 

4267
05:07:12,746 --> 05:07:13,313
DEMONSTRATES A CYNICISM, A 

4268
05:07:13,313 --> 05:07:13,981
WILLINGNESS TO SMEAR DR. FORD  

4269
05:07:13,981 --> 05:07:14,615
IF IT HELPS POLITICALLY DELAY 

4270
05:07:14,615 --> 05:07:15,015
THIS NOMINATION. 

4271
05:07:15,015 --> 05:07:15,682
I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION 

4272
05:07:15,682 --> 05:07:16,283
TO BE FAIR, IMPARTIAL, TO 

4273
05:07:16,283 --> 05:07:16,784
LISTEN TO THE EVIDENCE. 

4274
05:07:16,784 --> 05:07:17,418
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 

4275
05:07:17,418 --> 05:07:18,052
AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THIS 

4276
05:07:18,052 --> 05:07:18,419
COMMITTEE DOES. 

4277
05:07:18,419 --> 05:07:19,053
THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THE FULL 

4278
05:07:19,053 --> 05:07:19,386
SENATE DOES. 

4279
05:07:19,386 --> 05:07:19,720
>> SENATOR. 

4280
05:07:19,720 --> 05:07:20,354
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

4281
05:07:20,354 --> 05:07:20,988
YESTERDAY WAS AN IMPORTANT AND 

4282
05:07:20,988 --> 05:07:21,355
DIFFICULT DAY. 

4283
05:07:21,355 --> 05:07:21,688
A LONG DAY. 

4284
05:07:21,688 --> 05:07:22,222
FOR DR. FORD,  FOR JUDGE 

4285
05:07:22,222 --> 05:07:22,790
KAVANAUGH, FOR THE SENATE 

4286
05:07:22,790 --> 05:07:23,390
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, FOR THE 

4287
05:07:23,390 --> 05:07:23,624
NATION. 

4288
05:07:23,624 --> 05:07:24,258
AND I WILL SAY  BRIEFLY THAT 

4289
05:07:24,258 --> 05:07:24,792
BEFORE YESTERDAY BEGAN I 

4290
05:07:24,792 --> 05:07:25,025
PRAYED. 

4291
05:07:25,025 --> 05:07:25,659
I PRAYED FOR DR. FORD AND HER 

4292
05:07:25,659 --> 05:07:25,893
FAMILY. 

4293
05:07:25,893 --> 05:07:26,527
I PRAYED FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

4294
05:07:26,527 --> 05:07:27,194
I PRAYED FOR THE CHAIRMAN  AND 

4295
05:07:27,194 --> 05:07:27,561
RANKING MEMBER. 

4296
05:07:27,561 --> 05:07:28,162
I PRAYED FOR THE PRESIDENT. 

4297
05:07:28,162 --> 05:07:28,729
I PRAYED FOR ALL WHO WOULD 

4298
05:07:28,729 --> 05:07:29,363
WATCH YESTERDAY WHO ARE VICTIMS 

4299
05:07:29,363 --> 05:07:29,997
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I PRAYED 

4300
05:07:29,997 --> 05:07:30,497
FOR ALL WHO WOULD WATCH 

4301
05:07:30,497 --> 05:07:31,198
YESTERDAY UNCERTAIN IF WE COULD 

4302
05:07:31,198 --> 05:07:31,865
CONDUCT OURSELVES RESPECTFULLY. 

4303
05:07:31,865 --> 05:07:32,533
AND I MUST SAY AFTER EVERYTHING 

4304
05:07:32,533 --> 05:07:33,200
I HAVE HEARD, I'M STRUCK THAT 

4305
05:07:33,200 --> 05:07:33,867
IN THE TWITTER FIELD POLITICS 

4306
05:07:33,867 --> 05:07:34,435
OF OUR DAY, WE MUST ASK 

4307
05:07:34,435 --> 05:07:34,968
OURSELVES WHAT ABOUT OUR 

4308
05:07:34,968 --> 05:07:35,235
CONDUCT? 

4309
05:07:35,235 --> 05:07:35,903
WHAT ABOUT THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE 

4310
05:07:35,903 --> 05:07:36,503
ANYONE TO COME FORWARD WITH 

4311
05:07:36,503 --> 05:07:37,171
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 

4312
05:07:37,171 --> 05:07:37,838
ASSAULT, TO SEEK A NOMINATION 

4313
05:07:37,838 --> 05:07:38,405
TO FEDERAL COURT OR OTHER 

4314
05:07:38,405 --> 05:07:39,106
POSITION OF -- POSITION OF TRUST

4315
05:07:39,106 --> 05:07:39,573
, OR TO SERVE HERE? 

4316
05:07:39,573 --> 05:07:40,174
I WILL PRAY FOR OUR NATION 

4317
05:07:40,174 --> 05:07:40,441
TONIGHT. 

4318
05:07:40,441 --> 05:07:41,075
THE BURDEN ON THIS COMMITTEE 

4319
05:07:41,075 --> 05:07:41,675
WAS TO ADDRESS, INVESTIGATE, 

4320
05:07:41,675 --> 05:07:42,342
AND RESOLVE REASONABLE DOUBTS 

4321
05:07:42,342 --> 05:07:42,910
AS TO CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS 

4322
05:07:42,910 --> 05:07:43,577
AGAINST THE NOMINEE BEFORE THEM.

4323
05:07:43,577 --> 05:07:44,211
BY THAT TEST, THIS COMMITTEE 

4324
05:07:44,211 --> 05:07:44,545
HAS FAILED. 

4325
05:07:44,545 --> 05:07:45,179
I KNOW WE HAVE HEARD STRONG 

4326
05:07:45,179 --> 05:07:45,846
WORDS ABOUT MANY COLLEAGUES. 

4327
05:07:45,846 --> 05:07:46,413
AND MY PREDECESSOR, LONG 

4328
05:07:46,413 --> 05:07:47,047
SERVING SENATOR JOE BIDEN HAS 

4329
05:07:47,047 --> 05:07:47,648
BEEN COURTED BY MANY AND I 

4330
05:07:47,648 --> 05:07:48,282
WOULD SAY MISQUOTED AT TIMES. 

4331
05:07:48,282 --> 05:07:48,916
I WANT TO SHARE ONE QUOTE HE 

4332
05:07:48,916 --> 05:07:49,249
SAID TO ME. 

4333
05:07:49,249 --> 05:07:49,850
IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO 

4334
05:07:49,850 --> 05:07:50,451
QUESTION ANOTHER SENATOR'S 

4335
05:07:50,451 --> 05:07:50,751
POLICIES. 

4336
05:07:50,751 --> 05:07:51,385
IT IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE TO 

4337
05:07:51,385 --> 05:07:51,985
QUESTION PRIORITIES BUT IS 

4338
05:07:51,985 --> 05:07:52,619
NEVER APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION 

4339
05:07:52,619 --> 05:07:52,886
MOTIVES. 

4340
05:07:52,886 --> 05:07:53,554
AND THERE HAS BEEN FAR TOO MUCH 

4341
05:07:53,554 --> 05:07:54,188
OF THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED IN 

4342
05:07:54,188 --> 05:07:54,555
THIS PROCESS. 

4343
05:07:54,555 --> 05:07:55,189
IN A WAY THAT, FRANKLY, WILL 

4344
05:07:55,189 --> 05:07:55,789
MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO 

4345
05:07:55,789 --> 05:07:56,423
TAKE OFF OUR PARTISAN JERSEYS 

4346
05:07:56,423 --> 05:07:57,057
AND GET BACK TO THE IMPORTANT 

4347
05:07:57,057 --> 05:07:57,691
WORK OF FINDING SOLUTIONS TO 

4348
05:07:57,691 --> 05:07:58,358
THE REAL CHALLENGES FACING THIS 

4349
05:07:58,358 --> 05:07:58,625
COUNTRY. 

4350
05:07:58,625 --> 05:07:59,293
WHAT I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR 

4351
05:07:59,293 --> 05:07:59,893
IN THIS PROCESS IS THE FAX. 

4352
05:07:59,893 --> 05:08:00,194
-- FACTS. 

4353
05:08:00,194 --> 05:08:00,861
MANY OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONED THE 

4354
05:08:00,861 --> 05:08:01,128
TIMING. 

4355
05:08:01,128 --> 05:08:01,795
I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THESE 

4356
05:08:01,795 --> 05:08:02,396
POINTS AND WANT TO EXPLAIN 

4357
05:08:02,396 --> 05:08:02,729
BRIEFLY WHY. 

4358
05:08:02,729 --> 05:08:03,397
THE FIRST TIME I LEARNED OF THE 

4359
05:08:03,397 --> 05:08:03,897
ALLEGATIONS THAT JUDGE 

4360
05:08:03,897 --> 05:08:04,531
KAVANAUGH  SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 

4361
05:08:04,531 --> 05:08:05,065
HER WAS ON SEPTEMBER 12. 

4362
05:08:05,065 --> 05:08:05,599
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN 

4363
05:08:05,599 --> 05:08:06,233
DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO 

4364
05:08:06,233 --> 05:08:06,900
MYSELF AND OTHER DEMOCRATS ONLY 

4365
05:08:06,900 --> 05:08:07,534
AFTER REPORTERS HAD LEARNED OF 

4366
05:08:07,534 --> 05:08:08,235
THE LETTER DR. FORD PROVIDED.  

4367
05:08:08,235 --> 05:08:08,802
I REGRET THAT THIS LEAK. 

4368
05:08:08,802 --> 05:08:09,436
THE DECISION IF SHE CAME FOR 

4369
05:08:09,436 --> 05:08:10,104
SHOULD'VE BEEN DR. FORD 'S AND 

4370
05:08:10,104 --> 05:08:10,571
DR. FORD 'S ALONE. 

4371
05:08:10,571 --> 05:08:11,171
I CANNOT RULE OUT THAT THE 

4372
05:08:11,171 --> 05:08:11,839
PERSON WHO LEAKED THIS HAD AN 

4373
05:08:11,839 --> 05:08:12,473
AGENDA BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT 

4374
05:08:12,473 --> 05:08:13,073
RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN DID 

4375
05:08:13,073 --> 05:08:13,774
NOT DISCLOSE THAT PRIOR TO THAT 

4376
05:08:13,774 --> 05:08:14,441
DATE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIRS 

4377
05:08:14,441 --> 05:08:14,741
TO SHARE. 

4378
05:08:14,741 --> 05:08:15,409
I THINK IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT 

4379
05:08:15,409 --> 05:08:15,909
LONG SERVING HONORABLE 

4380
05:08:15,909 --> 05:08:16,443
COLLEAGUES OF HERS HAVE 

4381
05:08:16,443 --> 05:08:16,977
QUESTIONED HER MOTIVES. 

4382
05:08:16,977 --> 05:08:17,611
I KNOW SINCE THE DAY THAT MY 

4383
05:08:17,611 --> 05:08:18,212
COLLEAGUES AND I LEARNED OF 

4384
05:08:18,212 --> 05:08:18,846
THESE ALLEGATIONS WE'VE HAD ONE 

4385
05:08:18,846 --> 05:08:19,513
CONSISTENT REQUEST TO ALLOW THE 

4386
05:08:19,513 --> 05:08:20,147
FBI TO INVESTIGATE THEM IN A 

4387
05:08:20,147 --> 05:08:20,714
NONPARTISAN, PROFESSIONAL, 

4388
05:08:20,714 --> 05:08:21,381
EVENHANDED MANNER AND DELIVERED 

4389
05:08:21,381 --> 05:08:21,982
THEIR FINDINGS SO WE COULD 

4390
05:08:21,982 --> 05:08:22,416
REACH A CONCLUSION. 

4391
05:08:22,416 --> 05:08:23,016
THAT SAME NIGHT SHE SENT A 

4392
05:08:23,016 --> 05:08:23,617
LETTER REQUESTING SUCH AN 

4393
05:08:23,617 --> 05:08:23,984
INVESTIGATION. 

4394
05:08:23,984 --> 05:08:24,618
ASSESSED -- TO SUGGEST THAT 

4395
05:08:24,618 --> 05:08:25,185
LETTERS ARE AN ADEQUATE 

4396
05:08:25,185 --> 05:08:25,853
SUBSTITUTE FOR EFFECT GATHERING 

4397
05:08:25,853 --> 05:08:26,453
PROCESS THAT WE MIGHT THEN 

4398
05:08:26,453 --> 05:08:27,054
CONSIDER IS NOT CREDIBLE AND 

4399
05:08:27,054 --> 05:08:27,621
REFLECTS SADLY, A WILLFUL 

4400
05:08:27,621 --> 05:08:28,288
BLINDNESS TO THE INSTITUTION. 

4401
05:08:28,288 --> 05:08:28,889
TO MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE 

4402
05:08:28,889 --> 05:08:29,356
AISLE, YOU KNOW ME. 

4403
05:08:29,356 --> 05:08:30,023
YOU KNOW I TRY TO BE FAIR TO 

4404
05:08:30,023 --> 05:08:30,290
NOMINEES. 

4405
05:08:30,290 --> 05:08:30,924
I RESPECT THIS PROCESS AND THE 

4406
05:08:30,924 --> 05:08:31,525
MIDI OF THOSE WITH WHOM I 

4407
05:08:31,525 --> 05:08:32,126
PASSIONATELY DISAGREE. IF I 

4408
05:08:32,126 --> 05:08:32,693
WERE CONVINCED THIS WERE 

4409
05:08:32,693 --> 05:08:33,327
NOTHING MORE THAN A PARTISAN 

4410
05:08:33,327 --> 05:08:34,027
HIT JOB DESIGNED TO TAKE DOWN A 

4411
05:08:34,027 --> 05:08:34,661
GUNMAN AND HOLD THE POSITION 

4412
05:08:34,661 --> 05:08:35,262
VACANT, I WOULD NOT STAND FOR 

4413
05:08:35,262 --> 05:08:35,462
IT. 

4414
05:08:35,462 --> 05:08:36,029
AN INVESTIGATION WOULD BE 

4415
05:08:36,029 --> 05:08:36,630
HELPFUL BECAUSE DR. FORD 'S 

4416
05:08:36,630 --> 05:08:37,364
RECOLLECTION OF HER ASSAULT WAS 

4417
05:08:37,364 --> 05:08:37,865
SEARING BUT INCOMPLETE. 

4418
05:08:37,865 --> 05:08:38,532
DR. FORD  TESTIFIED CREDIBLY 

4419
05:08:38,532 --> 05:08:39,133
ABOUT THESE PAINFUL MEMORIES 

4420
05:08:39,133 --> 05:08:39,666
SHE'S CARRIED WITH HER. 

4421
05:08:39,666 --> 05:08:40,300
THE FEELING OF A HAND CLASPED 

4422
05:08:40,300 --> 05:08:40,901
OVER HER MOUTH AND NOT BEING 

4423
05:08:40,901 --> 05:08:41,301
ABLE TO BREATHE. 

4424
05:08:41,301 --> 05:08:41,969
THE SOUND OF LAUGHTER WHILE SHE 

4425
05:08:41,969 --> 05:08:42,703
WAS PINNED ON A BED. THE WEIGHT 

4426
05:08:42,703 --> 05:08:43,403
OF A BODY ON TOP OF HER AND OF 

4427
05:08:43,403 --> 05:08:44,037
FEELING OF RELIEF FLEEING THE 

4428
05:08:44,037 --> 05:08:44,271
HOUSE. 

4429
05:08:44,271 --> 05:08:44,872
SHE TESTIFIED WITH CERTAINTY 

4430
05:08:44,872 --> 05:08:45,506
THAT THE PERSON WHO ASSAULTED 

4431
05:08:45,506 --> 05:08:46,140
HER WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO SHE 

4432
05:08:46,140 --> 05:08:46,640
KNEW THROUGH MULTIPLE  

4433
05:08:46,640 --> 05:08:47,141
ACQUAINTANCES AND HAD 

4434
05:08:47,141 --> 05:08:47,741
SOCIALIZED WITH HIM MULTIPLE 

4435
05:08:47,741 --> 05:08:48,041
OCCASIONS. 

4436
05:08:48,041 --> 05:08:48,642
BUT IT IS TRUE AS WIDELY 

4437
05:08:48,642 --> 05:08:49,276
REPEATED THAT DR. FORD CANNOT 

4438
05:08:49,276 --> 05:08:49,977
PINPOINT  THE DATE OR THE TIME 

4439
05:08:49,977 --> 05:08:50,544
OF THE ASSAULT, THE EXACT 

4440
05:08:50,544 --> 05:08:51,178
LOCATION, AND THAT SHE DID NOT 

4441
05:08:51,178 --> 05:08:51,845
TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THAT ASSAULT 

4442
05:08:51,845 --> 05:08:52,179
AT THAT TIME. 

4443
05:08:52,179 --> 05:08:52,846
THERE IS NOT AN EYEWITNESS WHO 

4444
05:08:52,846 --> 05:08:53,447
IS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THE 

4445
05:08:53,447 --> 05:08:53,847
DETAILS OF THIS. 

4446
05:08:53,847 --> 05:08:54,448
ALL OF WHICH IS TYPICAL OF 

4447
05:08:54,448 --> 05:08:55,048
SEXUAL ASSAULT. MANY EXPERTS 

4448
05:08:55,048 --> 05:08:55,716
HAVE SAID HOW COMMON IT IS FOR 

4449
05:08:55,716 --> 05:08:56,316
SURVIVORS TO REMEMBER SOME 

4450
05:08:56,316 --> 05:08:56,884
FACTS WITH CLARITY AND NOT 

4451
05:08:56,884 --> 05:08:57,117
OTHERS. 

4452
05:08:57,117 --> 05:08:57,784
IT HAS TO DO A SURVIVAL MODE 

4453
05:08:57,784 --> 05:08:58,285
THAT TURNS ON WHEN WE 

4454
05:08:58,285 --> 05:08:58,719
EXPERIENCE TRAUMA. 

4455
05:08:58,719 --> 05:08:59,319
THE VAST MAJORITY OF VICTIMS 

4456
05:08:59,319 --> 05:09:00,020
DELAY DISCLOSING WHAT HAPPENED 

4457
05:09:00,020 --> 05:09:00,687
OR NEVER DISCLOSE IT AT ALL. 

4458
05:09:00,687 --> 05:09:01,388
ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING THINGS 

4459
05:09:01,388 --> 05:09:02,022
ABOUT THIS HEARING FOR ME HAS 

4460
05:09:02,022 --> 05:09:02,623
BEEN THE SO FAR FIVE, FIVE 

4461
05:09:02,623 --> 05:09:03,257
PERSONAL FRIENDS, ACQUAINTANCES

4462
05:09:03,257 --> 05:09:03,891
, PEOPLE I'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS 

4463
05:09:03,891 --> 05:09:04,591
OR DECADES WHO HAVE CONVEYED TO 

4464
05:09:04,591 --> 05:09:05,259
ME THEIR EXPERIENCES OF SEXUAL 

4465
05:09:05,259 --> 05:09:05,859
ASSAULT ON THIS PHONE WHILE 

4466
05:09:05,859 --> 05:09:06,460
THIS TESTIMONY WAS GOING ON. 

4467
05:09:06,460 --> 05:09:07,127
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS AN 

4468
05:09:07,127 --> 05:09:07,794
OCEAN OF PAIN IN THIS NATION 

4469
05:09:07,794 --> 05:09:08,362
NOT FULLY HEARD, NOT FULLY 

4470
05:09:08,362 --> 05:09:08,962
ADDRESSED, NOT APPROPRIATELY 

4471
05:09:08,962 --> 05:09:09,229
RESOLVED. 

4472
05:09:09,229 --> 05:09:09,863
AND I FOR ONE WILL NOT -- THE 

4473
05:09:09,863 --> 05:09:10,497
REFRAIN SAID BY TOO MANY IN 

4474
05:09:10,497 --> 05:09:11,131
RESPONSE TO THESE ALLEGATIONS BY

4475
05:09:11,131 --> 05:09:11,798
DR. FORD THAT IT HAPPENED TOO 

4476
05:09:11,798 --> 05:09:12,466
LONG AGO THAT  BOYS WILL BE 

4477
05:09:12,466 --> 05:09:12,666
BOYS. 

4478
05:09:12,666 --> 05:09:13,300
WE MUST DO BETTER THAN THAT. 

4479
05:09:13,300 --> 05:09:13,967
WE MUST SET A BETTER STANDARD 

4480
05:09:13,967 --> 05:09:14,568
FOR OUR OWN FAMILIES AND OUR 

4481
05:09:14,568 --> 05:09:14,801
FUTURE. 

4482
05:09:14,801 --> 05:09:15,402
I WORRY SINCERELY ABOUT THE 

4483
05:09:15,402 --> 05:09:15,969
MESSAGE WE ARE SENDING TO 

4484
05:09:15,969 --> 05:09:16,603
ASSAULT SURVIVORS IF WE PLOW 

4485
05:09:16,603 --> 05:09:17,171
AHEAD WITH THIS NOMINATION 

4486
05:09:17,171 --> 05:09:17,838
DESPITE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE 

4487
05:09:17,838 --> 05:09:18,172
ALLEGATIONS. 

4488
05:09:18,172 --> 05:09:18,772
AND I HAVE CONVEYED TO MY 

4489
05:09:18,772 --> 05:09:19,373
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES THAT 

4490
05:09:19,373 --> 05:09:20,040
I'VE WISHED WE WOULD TAKE A ONE-

4491
05:09:20,040 --> 05:09:20,374
WEEK BREAK. 

4492
05:09:20,374 --> 05:09:20,774
ONE WEEK ONLY. 

4493
05:09:20,774 --> 05:09:21,441
NOT TO SPELL THIS OUT PAST THE 

4494
05:09:21,441 --> 05:09:22,075
ELECTION, NOT TO PURSUE SOME 

4495
05:09:22,075 --> 05:09:22,743
PART A SINGLE, BUT TO ALLOW AN 

4496
05:09:22,743 --> 05:09:23,443
INTERVIEW WITH EVERYONE WHO MAY 

4497
05:09:23,443 --> 05:09:24,011
HAVE RELEVANT INFORMATION. 

4498
05:09:24,011 --> 05:09:24,678
STARTING, YES, WITH MARK JUDGE 

4499
05:09:24,678 --> 05:09:25,245
WHO OBVIOUSLY WILL NOT BE 

4500
05:09:25,245 --> 05:09:25,979
SUBPOENAED TO APPEAR BEFORE US. 

4501
05:09:25,979 --> 05:09:26,647
I WILL REMIND YOU BRIEFLY THAT 

4502
05:09:26,647 --> 05:09:27,314
MANY OF THOSE WHO CAME FORWARD 

4503
05:09:27,314 --> 05:09:27,915
TO SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

4504
05:09:27,915 --> 05:09:28,582
INCLUDING MY OWN PROFESSOR FROM 

4505
05:09:28,582 --> 05:09:29,116
YALE LAW SCHOOL AND AN 

4506
05:09:29,116 --> 05:09:29,816
ORGANIZATION I'VE LONG LONG TO 

4507
05:09:29,816 --> 05:09:30,517
HAVE SPOKEN UP TO ALSO REQUEST 

4508
05:09:30,517 --> 05:09:31,118
A THOROUGH AND PROFESSIONAL 

4509
05:09:31,118 --> 05:09:31,685
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. 

4510
05:09:31,685 --> 05:09:32,319
I THINK TO ASK FOR A WEEK IS 

4511
05:09:32,319 --> 05:09:32,886
NOT TO ASK FOR TOO MUCH. 

4512
05:09:32,886 --> 05:09:33,554
WHEN ANITA HILL CAME FORWARD, 

4513
05:09:33,554 --> 05:09:34,188
THE WHITE HOUSE COOPERATED AND 

4514
05:09:34,188 --> 05:09:34,855
IN FOUR DAYS, IN FOUR DAYS A 

4515
05:09:34,855 --> 05:09:35,489
HEARING WAS PUT TOGETHER WITH 

4516
05:09:35,489 --> 05:09:35,856
22 WITNESSES. 

4517
05:09:35,856 --> 05:09:36,523
I THINK THAT IS WHAT DR. FORD 

4518
05:09:36,523 --> 05:09:36,823
DESERVES.  

4519
05:09:36,823 --> 05:09:37,424
I THINK THAT IS WHAT HER 

4520
05:09:37,424 --> 05:09:37,858
BRAVERY DESERVES. 

4521
05:09:37,858 --> 05:09:38,559
I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE NATION 

4522
05:09:38,559 --> 05:09:38,825
DESERVES. 

4523
05:09:38,825 --> 05:09:39,459
I WOULD NOT GO THROUGH A LONG 

4524
05:09:39,459 --> 05:09:40,127
POINT BY POINT -- OF WHAT WE 

4525
05:09:40,127 --> 05:09:40,727
HAVE JUST HEARD BUT LET ME 

4526
05:09:40,727 --> 05:09:41,361
SIMPLY SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT 

4527
05:09:41,361 --> 05:09:41,895
DR. FORD'S  TESTIMONY. 

4528
05:09:41,895 --> 05:09:42,596
SHE HAD THE PAIN OF THIS ATTACK 

4529
05:09:42,596 --> 05:09:42,930
FOR TOO LONG. 

4530
05:09:42,930 --> 05:09:43,530
HER MEMORIES DO NOT SAVORS 

4531
05:09:43,530 --> 05:09:43,730
LOAN. 

4532
05:09:43,730 --> 05:09:44,431
DR. FORD  TOLD HER HUSBAND IN 

4533
05:09:44,431 --> 05:09:44,631
2002. 

4534
05:09:44,631 --> 05:09:45,332
SHE TOLD THERAPISTS IN 2012 AND 

4535
05:09:45,332 --> 05:09:45,532
2013. 

4536
05:09:45,532 --> 05:09:46,133
SHE TOLD FRIENDS IN SEVERAL 

4537
05:09:46,133 --> 05:09:46,366
YEARS. 

4538
05:09:46,366 --> 05:09:46,934
AND HAS SUBMITTED TESTIMONY 

4539
05:09:46,934 --> 05:09:47,534
ABOUT ALL OF THAT TO THIS 

4540
05:09:47,534 --> 05:09:47,834
COMMITTEE. 

4541
05:09:47,834 --> 05:09:48,535
DR. FORD  WHEN SHE CAME FORWARD 

4542
05:09:48,535 --> 05:09:49,136
<u>ESTERDAY, HAD N </u>

4543
05:09:49,136 --> 05:09:49,570
AND A LOT TO LOSE. 

4544
05:09:49,570 --> 05:09:50,170
SHE CAME FORWARD TO TESTIFY 

4545
05:09:50,170 --> 05:09:50,704
ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE OF 

4546
05:09:50,704 --> 05:09:50,971
ASSAULT. 

4547
05:09:50,971 --> 05:09:51,572
I'M GOING TO USE HER WORDS. 

4548
05:09:51,572 --> 05:09:52,172
SHE SAID I'M HERE TODAY NOT 

4549
05:09:52,172 --> 05:09:52,739
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE, I'M 

4550
05:09:52,739 --> 05:09:53,040
TERRIFIED. 

4551
05:09:53,040 --> 05:09:53,674
I'M HERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT 

4552
05:09:53,674 --> 05:09:54,308
IS MY CIVIC DUTY TO TELL YOU 

4553
05:09:54,308 --> 05:09:55,008
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHILE BRETT 

4554
05:09:55,008 --> 05:09:55,676
KAVANAUGH  AND I WERE IN HIGH 

4555
05:09:55,676 --> 05:09:55,909
SCHOOL. 

4556
05:09:55,909 --> 05:09:56,243
CIVIC DUTY. 

4557
05:09:56,243 --> 05:09:56,843
THE CIVIC DUTY TO TELL THE 

4558
05:09:56,843 --> 05:09:57,077
TRUTH. 

4559
05:09:57,077 --> 05:09:57,711
DR. FORD CAME FORWARD TO VOICE 

4560
05:09:57,711 --> 05:09:58,378
CONCERNS ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  

4561
05:09:58,378 --> 05:09:58,912
BEFORE HE WAS NOMINATED. 

4562
05:09:58,912 --> 05:09:59,413
SHE REACHED OUT TO HER 

4563
05:09:59,413 --> 05:10:00,047
CONGRESSWOMAN ANONYMOUSLY AND 

4564
05:10:00,047 --> 05:10:00,747
TO THE WASHINGTON POST AS WELL 

4565
05:10:00,747 --> 05:10:01,315
WHEN HIS NAME WAS ON THE 

4566
05:10:01,315 --> 05:10:01,615
SHORTLIST. 

4567
05:10:01,615 --> 05:10:02,282
SHE WAS NOT LYING IN WAIT FOR A 

4568
05:10:02,282 --> 05:10:02,950
TIME TO MAKE A BIG REVEAL TO 

4569
05:10:02,950 --> 05:10:03,350
SINK A NOMINEE. 

4570
05:10:03,350 --> 05:10:04,017
SHE WANTED THIS INFORMATION TO 

4571
05:10:04,017 --> 05:10:04,551
GET TO PRESIDENT -- THE 

4572
05:10:04,551 --> 05:10:05,185
PRESIDENT BEFORE HE MADE HIS 

4573
05:10:05,185 --> 05:10:05,485
SELECTION. 

4574
05:10:05,485 --> 05:10:06,119
JUDGE KAVANAUGH  UNEQUIVOCALLY 

4575
05:10:06,119 --> 05:10:06,787
DENIED THAT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 

4576
05:10:06,787 --> 05:10:07,154
HIM YESTERDAY. 

4577
05:10:07,154 --> 05:10:07,654
BUT SOMETHING HE SAID 

4578
05:10:07,654 --> 05:10:08,255
REPEATEDLY WAS NOT ACCURATE. 

4579
05:10:08,255 --> 05:10:08,789
OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE 

4580
05:10:08,789 --> 05:10:09,389
TESTIFIED AND WE JUST HEARD 

4581
05:10:09,389 --> 05:10:10,090
REPEATED TODAY THAT DR. FORD'S  

4582
05:10:10,090 --> 05:10:10,691
ACCOUNT WAS REFUTED BY THREE 

4583
05:10:10,691 --> 05:10:11,024
INDIVIDUALS. 

4584
05:10:11,024 --> 05:10:11,525
THAT'S NOT THE CASE. 

4585
05:10:11,525 --> 05:10:12,159
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH KNOWS IT.  

4586
05:10:12,159 --> 05:10:12,826
NOT RECALL IT IS NOT THE SAME 

4587
05:10:12,826 --> 05:10:13,160
AS REFUTING. 

4588
05:10:13,160 --> 05:10:13,827
THEIR STATEMENTS SAY THEY DON'T 

4589
05:10:13,827 --> 05:10:14,428
REMEMBER THE GATHERING. OF 

4590
05:10:14,428 --> 05:10:15,028
COURSE, NONE OF THESE THREE 

4591
05:10:15,028 --> 05:10:15,696
PEOPLE WERE SALTED THAT NIGHT. 

4592
05:10:15,696 --> 05:10:16,330
FOR TWO OF THEM IT WOULD'VE 

4593
05:10:16,330 --> 05:10:16,930
BEEN AN UNREMARKABLE EVENING. 

4594
05:10:16,930 --> 05:10:17,531
JUST ANOTHER CASUAL SUMMER. 

4595
05:10:17,531 --> 05:10:18,165
LELAND KAISER SAID THAT SHE 

4596
05:10:18,165 --> 05:10:18,832
BELIEVES DR. FORD'S  ACCOUNT. 

4597
05:10:18,832 --> 05:10:19,533
THAT'S A FACT THAT HASN'T BEEN 

4598
05:10:19,533 --> 05:10:19,866
ACKNOWLEDGED. 

4599
05:10:19,866 --> 05:10:20,601
IN MY FIELD -- VIEW, -- IT IS A 

4600
05:10:20,601 --> 05:10:21,301
FAILURE IN THE EFFORT TO GET TO 

4601
05:10:21,301 --> 05:10:21,602
THE TRUTH. 

4602
05:10:21,602 --> 05:10:22,169
WE ALSO HAVE TO FACE THE 

4603
05:10:22,169 --> 05:10:22,803
REALITY, THERE ARE ADDITIONAL 

4604
05:10:22,803 --> 05:10:23,437
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS BROUGHT IN 

4605
05:10:23,437 --> 05:10:23,971
BY MS. RAMIREZ AND MISS 

4606
05:10:23,971 --> 05:10:24,638
SWETNICK WHO OF BOTH  ASPIRIN 

4607
05:10:24,638 --> 05:10:25,105
FBI INVESTIGATION. 

4608
05:10:25,105 --> 05:10:25,672
THEIR CLAIMS HAVE VARYING 

4609
05:10:25,672 --> 05:10:26,306
CREDIBILITY BUT DESERVE TO BE 

4610
05:10:26,306 --> 05:10:26,540
HEARD. 

4611
05:10:26,540 --> 05:10:27,140
I WISH JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD 

4612
05:10:27,140 --> 05:10:27,808
HAVE SUPPORTED A SHORT  PAUSE 

4613
05:10:27,808 --> 05:10:28,408
FOR AN INVESTIGATION FOR THE 

4614
05:10:28,408 --> 05:10:29,009
BENEFIT OF CLEARING HIS OWN 

4615
05:10:29,009 --> 05:10:29,209
NAME. 

4616
05:10:29,209 --> 05:10:29,876
WHAT I WILL SAY AS I CONCLUDE 

4617
05:10:29,876 --> 05:10:30,410
-- BUT I WILL SAY AS I 

4618
05:10:30,410 --> 05:10:31,044
CONCLUDE, THERE IS SUCH THING 

4619
05:10:31,044 --> 05:10:31,745
-- SUCH -- SOMETHING GREATER AT 

4620
05:10:31,745 --> 05:10:31,979
STAKE. 

4621
05:10:31,979 --> 05:10:32,512
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT HIS 

4622
05:10:32,512 --> 05:10:32,846
CREDIBILITY. 

4623
05:10:32,846 --> 05:10:33,347
IT'S ABOUT THE COURT'S 

4624
05:10:33,347 --> 05:10:33,680
LEGITIMACY. 

4625
05:10:33,680 --> 05:10:34,381
WE ARE LEFT WITH THE REALITY IF 

4626
05:10:34,381 --> 05:10:34,982
HIS NOMINATION GOES FORWARD 

4627
05:10:34,982 --> 05:10:35,582
THIS MORNING, AFTER TESTIMONY 

4628
05:10:35,582 --> 05:10:36,183
FULL OF RAGE AND VITRIOL BUT 

4629
05:10:36,183 --> 05:10:36,717
WITHOUT A BRIEF PAUSE FOR 

4630
05:10:36,717 --> 05:10:37,384
NONPARTISAN INVESTIGATIONS, HIS 

4631
05:10:37,384 --> 05:10:38,018
SERVICE MAY HAVE AN ASTERIX. 

4632
05:10:38,018 --> 05:10:38,585
THEY WILL HAVE REASON TO 

4633
05:10:38,585 --> 05:10:39,186
QUESTION THE FAIRNESS OF THE 

4634
05:10:39,186 --> 05:10:39,519
INSTITUTION. 

4635
05:10:39,519 --> 05:10:40,187
THAT IS TOO GREAT A COST TO 

4636
05:10:40,187 --> 05:10:40,854
IMPOSE IN EXCHANGE FOR ANY ONE 

4637
05:10:40,854 --> 05:10:41,054
MAN. 

4638
05:10:41,054 --> 05:10:41,788
IT IS MY HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES

4639
05:10:41,788 --> 05:10:42,322
, THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET 

4640
05:10:42,322 --> 05:10:42,856
DECIDED OR DECLARED THEIR 

4641
05:10:42,856 --> 05:10:43,523
DECISION WILL STILL JOIN IN A 

4642
05:10:43,523 --> 05:10:44,191
REQUEST TO ALLOW THE FBI TO DO 

4643
05:10:44,191 --> 05:10:44,791
IT'S IMPORTANT WORK AND FOR 

4644
05:10:44,791 --> 05:10:45,459
THIS COMMITTEE TO ALLOW ITSELF 

4645
05:10:45,459 --> 05:10:46,126
THE TIME TO GET TO THE BOTTOM 

4646
05:10:46,126 --> 05:10:46,760
OF THE REMAINING ALLEGATIONS. 

4647
05:10:46,760 --> 05:10:47,427
EVEN THE VOTE, I KNOW THAT IS 

4648
05:10:47,427 --> 05:10:47,828
HIGHLY UNLIKELY. 

4649
05:10:47,828 --> 05:10:48,495
-- GIVEN THE VOTE, I KNOW THAT 

4650
05:10:48,495 --> 05:10:48,996
IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. 

4651
05:10:48,996 --> 05:10:49,663
THOSE HEARINGS BEGAN WITHOUT A 

4652
05:10:49,663 --> 05:10:50,397
DECLARED POSITION BY MANY OF MY 

4653
05:10:50,397 --> 05:10:50,964
COLLEAGUES ON THIS SIDE. 

4654
05:10:50,964 --> 05:10:51,431
FOR ME, IT WAS JUDGE 

4655
05:10:51,431 --> 05:10:52,065
KAVANAUGH'S  EXTREME VIEWS ON 

4656
05:10:52,065 --> 05:10:52,633
PRESIDENTIAL POWER THAT I 

4657
05:10:52,633 --> 05:10:53,300
ENGAGE WITH HIM VIGOROUSLY ON 

4658
05:10:53,300 --> 05:10:53,900
AND THAT I BELIEVE I ENGAGE 

4659
05:10:53,900 --> 05:10:54,568
WITH HIM RESPECTFULLY ON THAT 

4660
05:10:54,568 --> 05:10:55,168
DETERMINED MY VOTE ON HIM. 

4661
05:10:55,168 --> 05:10:55,769
BUT FOR US TO PROCEED TODAY 

4662
05:10:55,769 --> 05:10:56,403
WITHOUT GIVING THE THOUGHTFUL, 

4663
05:10:56,403 --> 05:10:56,903
SERIOUS, AND THOROUGH 

4664
05:10:56,903 --> 05:10:57,471
INVESTIGATION IS FOR THIS 

4665
05:10:57,471 --> 05:10:58,171
COMMITTEE TO FAIL TO DO ITS JOB.

4666
05:10:58,171 --> 05:10:58,872
I PRAY THAT AFTER TODAY WE MAY 

4667
05:10:58,872 --> 05:10:59,573
YET FIND A WAY TO WORK TOGETHER 

4668
05:10:59,573 --> 05:11:00,140
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY, THE 

4669
05:11:00,140 --> 05:11:00,807
COUNTRY, THE WORLD DESERVES NO 

4670
05:11:00,807 --> 05:11:01,008
LESS. 

4671
05:11:01,008 --> 05:11:01,308
THANK YOU. 

4672
05:11:01,308 --> 05:11:01,842
>> I'M GOING TO ASK MY 

4673
05:11:01,842 --> 05:11:02,476
COLLEAGUES ON THE SIDE OF THE 

4674
05:11:02,476 --> 05:11:03,110
AISLE IF -- AND I'M NOT GOING 

4675
05:11:03,110 --> 05:11:03,810
TO ASK THE DEMOCRATS TO DO THIS 

4676
05:11:03,810 --> 05:11:04,511
BUT COULD WE KIND OF -- I HAVE 

4677
05:11:04,511 --> 05:11:05,178
ONLY INTERRUPTED SENATOR CRUISE.

4678
05:11:05,178 --> 05:11:05,846
CAN WE MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE 

4679
05:11:05,846 --> 05:11:06,446
REMARKS A LITTLE SHORT SO 

4680
05:11:06,446 --> 05:11:06,913
EVERYBODY CAN SPEAK? 

4681
05:11:06,913 --> 05:11:07,314
SENATOR KENNEDY. 

4682
05:11:07,314 --> 05:11:07,547
OKAY. 

4683
05:11:07,547 --> 05:11:07,981
I GUESS I'M WRONG. 

4684
05:11:07,981 --> 05:11:08,248
SENATOR. 

4685
05:11:08,248 --> 05:11:08,849
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

4686
05:11:08,849 --> 05:11:09,249
I WILL DO THAT. 

4687
05:11:09,249 --> 05:11:09,916
I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND FIRST 

4688
05:11:09,916 --> 05:11:10,550
TO A NUMBER OF THE COMMENTS 

4689
05:11:10,550 --> 05:11:11,184
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE 

4690
05:11:11,184 --> 05:11:11,718
FBI INVESTIGATION AND THE 

4691
05:11:11,718 --> 05:11:12,386
DYNAMIC OF WHAT THIS COMMITTEE 

4692
05:11:12,386 --> 05:11:12,653
HAS DONE. 

4693
05:11:12,653 --> 05:11:13,287
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THIS 

4694
05:11:13,287 --> 05:11:13,820
COMMITTEE HAS CHANGED ITS 

4695
05:11:13,820 --> 05:11:14,121
PROCEDURE. 

4696
05:11:14,121 --> 05:11:14,788
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS 

4697
05:11:14,788 --> 05:11:15,489
CONDUCTED THIS BUSINESS IN THIS 

4698
05:11:15,489 --> 05:11:15,689
WAY. 

4699
05:11:15,689 --> 05:11:16,323
AGAIN, AS I SAID YESTERDAY, I 

4700
05:11:16,323 --> 05:11:16,857
THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE 

4701
05:11:16,857 --> 05:11:17,391
CLARIFIED AND CORRECTED. 

4702
05:11:17,391 --> 05:11:18,091
THE FACT IS THAT WHEN THE FBI 

4703
05:11:18,091 --> 05:11:18,558
DOES ITS BACKGROUND 

4704
05:11:18,558 --> 05:11:19,259
INVESTIGATION, IT DOES JUST THAT

4705
05:11:19,259 --> 05:11:19,893
. A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. 

4706
05:11:19,893 --> 05:11:20,527
TALKS TO PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE 

4707
05:11:20,527 --> 05:11:21,161
INFORMATION ABOUT THE NOMINEE. 

4708
05:11:21,161 --> 05:11:21,828
IT TAKES A STATEMENT FROM THEM. 

4709
05:11:21,828 --> 05:11:22,362
AND THEN IT DELIVERS ITS 

4710
05:11:22,362 --> 05:11:22,896
PACKAGE OF INVESTIGATIVE 

4711
05:11:22,896 --> 05:11:23,530
INFORMATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

4712
05:11:23,530 --> 05:11:24,131
WHICH PASSES IT ON TO THE 

4713
05:11:24,131 --> 05:11:24,431
COMMITTEE. 

4714
05:11:24,431 --> 05:11:25,132
THAT'S THE REPORT THIS COMMITTEE

4715
05:11:25,132 --> 05:11:25,666
RECEIVES FROM THE FBI. 

4716
05:11:25,666 --> 05:11:26,366
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT PRESIDENT 

4717
05:11:26,366 --> 05:11:26,867
BUSH REOPENED THE FBI 

4718
05:11:26,867 --> 05:11:27,467
INVESTIGATION WHEN THE ANITA 

4719
05:11:27,467 --> 05:11:28,035
HILL AFFIRMATION CAME OUT. 

4720
05:11:28,035 --> 05:11:28,702
MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- AND IF 

4721
05:11:28,702 --> 05:11:29,403
I'M WRONG, PLEASE CORRECT ME BUT

4722
05:11:29,403 --> 05:11:29,970
WHEN YOU AS THE CHAIRMAN 

4723
05:11:29,970 --> 05:11:30,537
FINALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE 

4724
05:11:30,537 --> 05:11:31,171
INFORMATION, THAT INFORMATION 

4725
05:11:31,171 --> 05:11:31,705
ALSO WENT TO THE FBI. 

4726
05:11:31,705 --> 05:11:32,272
PERHAPS IT WAS THE RANKING 

4727
05:11:32,272 --> 05:11:32,973
MEMBER THAT GAVE THE LETTER TO 

4728
05:11:32,973 --> 05:11:33,240
THE FBI. 

4729
05:11:33,240 --> 05:11:33,807
BUT THE FBI WAS GIVEN THE 

4730
05:11:33,807 --> 05:11:34,141
INFORMATION. 

4731
05:11:34,141 --> 05:11:34,541
IS THAT CORRECT? 

4732
05:11:34,541 --> 05:11:35,008
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 

4733
05:11:35,008 --> 05:11:35,676
AND HE SAID TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

4734
05:11:35,676 --> 05:11:36,343
IN THE USUAL WAY THEY DO, THEY 

4735
05:11:36,343 --> 05:11:36,810
CONSIDER IT CLOSED. 

4736
05:11:36,810 --> 05:11:37,444
>> SO FIRST OF ALL, THE FULL 

4737
05:11:37,444 --> 05:11:38,111
LETTER UNREACTED WAS GIVEN TO 

4738
05:11:38,111 --> 05:11:38,779
THE FBI -- REDACTED WAS GIVEN 

4739
05:11:38,779 --> 05:11:39,112
TO THE FBI. 

4740
05:11:39,112 --> 05:11:39,746
THEY DID EXACTLY WHAT USUALLY 

4741
05:11:39,746 --> 05:11:39,946
DOES. 

4742
05:11:39,946 --> 05:11:40,580
THAT IS TO REOPEN IT, IF YOU 

4743
05:11:40,580 --> 05:11:41,248
WILL, EVALUATE THE LETTER, AND 

4744
05:11:41,248 --> 05:11:41,815
I UNDERSTAND THE FBI THEN 

4745
05:11:41,815 --> 05:11:42,316
CLOSED IT AND SENT THE 

4746
05:11:42,316 --> 05:11:42,949
INFORMATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE 

4747
05:11:42,949 --> 05:11:43,583
AS THEY DID WITH THE PREVIOUS 

4748
05:11:43,583 --> 05:11:44,251
REPORT BEFORE THIS ALLEGATION 

4749
05:11:44,251 --> 05:11:44,518
CAME UP. 

4750
05:11:44,518 --> 05:11:44,951
IS THAT CORRECT? 

4751
05:11:44,951 --> 05:11:45,619
>> THE ONLY THING I CAN VERIFY 

4752
05:11:45,619 --> 05:11:46,320
IS THAT THE FBI DID WHAT THEY 

4753
05:11:46,320 --> 05:11:46,953
WOULD USUALLY DO AND THEY -- 

4754
05:11:46,953 --> 05:11:47,654
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS. 

4755
05:11:47,654 --> 05:11:48,288
AND THEY PROBABLY WOULD KEEP 

4756
05:11:48,288 --> 05:11:48,889
THEIR OWN INTERNAL STUFF TO 

4757
05:11:48,889 --> 05:11:49,222
THEMSELVES. 

4758
05:11:49,222 --> 05:11:49,890
THEY SENT A COVER LETTER TO THE 

4759
05:11:49,890 --> 05:11:50,490
WHITE HOUSE SAYING THE ISSUE 

4760
05:11:50,490 --> 05:11:50,791
WAS CLOSE. 

4761
05:11:50,791 --> 05:11:51,458
>> SO THE FBI DID LOOK AT THIS. 

4762
05:11:51,458 --> 05:11:52,125
THEY DID WHATEVER IT DOES IN 

4763
05:11:52,125 --> 05:11:52,759
BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND THEN 

4764
05:11:52,759 --> 05:11:53,393
THEY RESENT AN UPDATED AMOUNT 

4765
05:11:53,393 --> 05:11:53,994
OF INFORMATION TO THE WHITE 

4766
05:11:53,994 --> 05:11:54,661
HOUSE WHICH THEY THEN FORWARDED 

4767
05:11:54,661 --> 05:11:54,895
TO US. 

4768
05:11:54,895 --> 05:11:55,562
AND THEN THE PROCESS WHICH HAS 

4769
05:11:55,562 --> 05:11:56,229
BEEN TRADITIONALLY FOLLOWED WAS 

4770
05:11:56,229 --> 05:11:56,630
FOLLOWED AGAIN. 

4771
05:11:56,630 --> 05:11:57,264
AND I BELIEVE THAT IMMEDIATELY 

4772
05:11:57,264 --> 05:11:57,864
THE CHAIRMAN OPENED UP AN 

4773
05:11:57,864 --> 05:11:58,532
INVESTIGATION BY THIS COMMITTEE.

4774
05:11:58,532 --> 05:11:59,232
THAT ALSO IS CUSTOMARY PRACTICE.

4775
05:11:59,232 --> 05:11:59,866
AND AS HAS BEEN STATED BUT I 

4776
05:11:59,866 --> 05:12:00,400
WILL RESTATE AGAIN, OUR 

4777
05:12:00,400 --> 05:12:00,934
COMMITTEE STAFF WHICH IS 

4778
05:12:00,934 --> 05:12:01,568
EXTENSIVE AND WELL TRAIN HAS 

4779
05:12:01,568 --> 05:12:02,202
LEGAL AUTHORITIES -- TRAINED 

4780
05:12:02,202 --> 05:12:02,836
HAS LEGAL AUTHORITIES SIMILAR TO

4781
05:12:02,836 --> 05:12:03,303
FBI INVESTIGATORS. 

4782
05:12:03,303 --> 05:12:03,937
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERVIEWED 

4783
05:12:03,937 --> 05:12:04,604
AND THOSE WHO ARE REACHED OUT 

4784
05:12:04,604 --> 05:12:05,238
TO BY THE COMMITTEE ARE UNDER 

4785
05:12:05,238 --> 05:12:05,906
PENALTY OF A FELONY THAT COULD 

4786
05:12:05,906 --> 05:12:06,573
RESULT IN 5 YEARS IN PRISON IF 

4787
05:12:06,573 --> 05:12:07,274
THEY DON'T RESPOND HONESTLY AND 

4788
05:12:07,274 --> 05:12:07,908
CORRECTLY TO THE QUESTIONS. 

4789
05:12:07,908 --> 05:12:08,575
EVERY ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT 

4790
05:12:08,575 --> 05:12:09,242
WAS IDENTIFIED HAS BEEN REACHED 

4791
05:12:09,242 --> 05:12:09,476
OUT TO. 

4792
05:12:09,476 --> 05:12:10,110
NOW, SOME COMMENTS HAVE BEEN 

4793
05:12:10,110 --> 05:12:10,711
THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY SUBMIT 

4794
05:12:10,711 --> 05:12:11,378
THEMSELVES TO A DEPOSITION OR 

4795
05:12:11,378 --> 05:12:12,079
TO SOME KIND OF A COURT PROCESS 

4796
05:12:12,079 --> 05:12:12,612
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 

4797
05:12:12,612 --> 05:12:13,180
AS WE ARE AWARE OF, THE 

4798
05:12:13,180 --> 05:12:13,880
ALTERNATIVE IS TO TRY TO GET A 

4799
05:12:13,880 --> 05:12:14,381
STATEMENT FROM THEM. 

4800
05:12:14,381 --> 05:12:15,048
AND IN THIS CASE, UNDER PENALTY 

4801
05:12:15,048 --> 05:12:15,749
OF FELONY WERE FROM ALL OF THE 

4802
05:12:15,749 --> 05:12:16,049
WITNESSES. 

4803
05:12:16,049 --> 05:12:16,717
I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE 

4804
05:12:16,717 --> 05:12:17,351
WAS SOME PROCESS THAT WAS NOT 

4805
05:12:17,351 --> 05:12:18,051
FAIR. THE ARGUMENT THAT IT WAS 

4806
05:12:18,051 --> 05:12:18,618
NOT THE SAME THAT IT IS 

4807
05:12:18,618 --> 05:12:19,252
FOLLOWED IN THE PAST IS ALSO 

4808
05:12:19,252 --> 05:12:19,553
INACCURATE. 

4809
05:12:19,553 --> 05:12:20,120
THAT'S ALSO VERY CRITICAL. 

4810
05:12:20,120 --> 05:12:20,754
TO TURN TO THE ISSUE AT HAND, 

4811
05:12:20,754 --> 05:12:21,388
WE RECEIVED HOURS AND HOURS OF 

4812
05:12:21,388 --> 05:12:22,055
TESTIMONY FROM TWO WITNESSES. 

4813
05:12:22,055 --> 05:12:22,723
AND BOTH OF THEM, FRANKLY MADE 

4814
05:12:22,723 --> 05:12:23,090
STRONG CASES. 

4815
05:12:23,090 --> 05:12:23,757
THIS COMMITTEE IS UNDER THE NEED

4816
05:12:23,757 --> 05:12:24,424
TO EVALUATE THE TESTIMONY THAT 

4817
05:12:24,424 --> 05:12:24,725
WAS GIVEN. 

4818
05:12:24,725 --> 05:12:25,425
AND DETERMINE HOW IT WILL -- IN 

4819
05:12:25,425 --> 05:12:26,026
THAT CONTEXT, I CAME AWAY 

4820
05:12:26,026 --> 05:12:26,593
BELIEVING THERE HAD BEEN A 

4821
05:12:26,593 --> 05:12:27,260
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN DR. FORD'S  

4822
05:12:27,260 --> 05:12:27,461
PAST. 

4823
05:12:27,461 --> 05:12:28,095
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR WHEN, 

4824
05:12:28,095 --> 05:12:28,729
WHERE, AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES. 

4825
05:12:28,729 --> 05:12:29,429
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

4826
05:12:29,429 --> 05:12:30,063
THAT SHE TRUTHFULLY TESTIFIED 

4827
05:12:30,063 --> 05:12:30,664
THAT SHE HAD HAD A SEXUAL 

4828
05:12:30,664 --> 05:12:30,931
ASSAULT. 

4829
05:12:30,931 --> 05:12:31,631
I HAVE TO SAY, I ALSO LISTENED 

4830
05:12:31,631 --> 05:12:32,265
FAIRLY -- VERY CAREFULLY TO 

4831
05:12:32,265 --> 05:12:32,799
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS HE  

4832
05:12:32,799 --> 05:12:33,100
TESTIFIED. 

4833
05:12:33,100 --> 05:12:33,734
AND I FELT THAT THE TESTIMONY 

4834
05:12:33,734 --> 05:12:34,301
HE GAVE WAS ALSO HONEST. 

4835
05:12:34,301 --> 05:12:34,968
HE GAVE VERY STRONG TESTIMONY 

4836
05:12:34,968 --> 05:12:35,469
THAT HE WAS NOT THERE. 

4837
05:12:35,469 --> 05:12:36,136
AND SO, THIS COMMITTEE HAS TO 

4838
05:12:36,136 --> 05:12:36,837
FACE THE DIFFICULT TASK OF WHAT 

4839
05:12:36,837 --> 05:12:37,437
BURDEN OF PROOF APPLIES AND 

4840
05:12:37,437 --> 05:12:38,105
WHAT STANDARD DOESN'T APPLY IN 

4841
05:12:38,105 --> 05:12:38,672
EXERCISING THE ADVICE AND 

4842
05:12:38,672 --> 05:12:39,272
CONSENT THAT IT GIVES, AND 

4843
05:12:39,272 --> 05:12:39,940
THAT'S IT DIFFICULT THINK THAT 

4844
05:12:39,940 --> 05:12:40,540
EACH ONE OF US INDIVIDUALLY 

4845
05:12:40,540 --> 05:12:41,174
NEEDS TO FACE AND DEAL WITH. 

4846
05:12:41,174 --> 05:12:41,808
AS I HAVE SAID, I DON'T FEEL 

4847
05:12:41,808 --> 05:12:42,442
THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT 

4848
05:12:42,442 --> 05:12:43,043
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS THERE NOT 

4849
05:12:43,043 --> 05:12:43,710
NIGHT . I BELIEVE HIS TESTIMONY.

4850
05:12:43,710 --> 05:12:44,344
I BELIEVE DR. FORD'S  TESTIMONY 

4851
05:12:44,344 --> 05:12:44,945
ABOUT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND 

4852
05:12:44,945 --> 05:12:45,579
BECAUSE OF THAT, I WILL VOTE 

4853
05:12:45,579 --> 05:12:46,246
YES TODAY TO MOVE THE NOMINATION

4854
05:12:46,246 --> 05:12:46,646
FORWARD TO THE FLOOR. 

4855
05:12:46,947 --> 05:12:47,614
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS HAS BEEN 

4856
05:12:47,614 --> 05:12:48,048
MY FIRST PROCESS. 

4857
05:12:48,048 --> 05:12:48,749
MY FIRST TIME THROUGH A SUPREME 

4858
05:12:48,749 --> 05:12:49,316
COURT NOMINATION PROCESS. 

4859
05:12:49,316 --> 05:12:49,950
I FOUGHT FOR YEARS TO BE ON 

4860
05:12:49,950 --> 05:12:50,350
THIS COMMITTEE. 

4861
05:12:50,350 --> 05:12:51,051
IT'S THE ONE I WANTED TO BE ON 

4862
05:12:51,051 --> 05:12:51,718
AS SOON AS I GOT TO THE SENATE 

4863
05:12:51,718 --> 05:12:51,985
IN 2013. 

4864
05:12:51,985 --> 05:12:52,652
I MADE YOU AWARE OF THAT, SIR. 

4865
05:12:52,652 --> 05:12:53,253
IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE 

4866
05:12:53,253 --> 05:12:53,920
EXPERIENCE, A LIFETIME DREAM TO 

4867
05:12:53,920 --> 05:12:54,588
BE A PART OF THIS COMMITTEE. 

4868
05:12:54,588 --> 05:12:55,255
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU.

4869
05:12:55,255 --> 05:12:55,789
SOME PEOPLE HAVE EVEN 

4870
05:12:55,789 --> 05:12:56,456
CRITICIZED ME FOR THE AFFECTION 

4871
05:12:56,456 --> 05:12:57,157
WITH WHICH I HAVE FOR YOU, SIR. 

4872
05:12:57,157 --> 05:12:57,724
YOU HAVE BEEN A PARTNER. 

4873
05:12:57,724 --> 05:12:58,258
THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE 

4874
05:12:58,258 --> 05:12:58,892
SENIOR MEMBERS, YOU ALL -- 

4875
05:12:58,892 --> 05:12:59,559
SENATOR HATCH, SENATOR GRASSLEY,

4876
05:12:59,559 --> 05:13:00,060
SENATOR LEAHY, SENATOR 

4877
05:13:00,060 --> 05:13:00,727
FEINSTEIN, YOU WILL HAVE BEEN 

4878
05:13:00,727 --> 05:13:01,261
ANCHORS IN THIS ENTIRE 

4879
05:13:01,261 --> 05:13:01,962
INSTITUTION TO A TIME WHERE THE 

4880
05:13:01,962 --> 05:13:02,629
COMEDY WAS DEEPER AND GREATER 

4881
05:13:02,629 --> 05:13:03,330
AND HAVE RESISTED IN MANY WAYS 

4882
05:13:03,330 --> 05:13:03,930
THAT I FIND ADMIRABLE. THE 

4883
05:13:03,930 --> 05:13:04,598
DRIFT TOWARDS TRIBALISM WITHIN 

4884
05:13:04,598 --> 05:13:05,198
THIS INSTITUTION. WHEN A 

4885
05:13:05,198 --> 05:13:05,866
VACANCY HAPPENED, I WAS ONE OF 

4886
05:13:05,866 --> 05:13:06,500
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO NOT 

4887
05:13:06,500 --> 05:13:07,134
WAIT LONG BEFORE I NOTICED MY 

4888
05:13:07,134 --> 05:13:07,701
INTENTIONS TO VOTE AGAINST 

4889
05:13:07,701 --> 05:13:08,135
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

4890
05:13:08,135 --> 05:13:08,702
AND, SIR, I DID IT FOR 

4891
05:13:08,702 --> 05:13:09,236
SINCERELY HELD BELIEFS. 

4892
05:13:09,236 --> 05:13:09,870
I DID IT BECAUSE I FELT THIS 

4893
05:13:09,870 --> 05:13:10,537
WAS A PERSON THAT HAD MADE IT 

4894
05:13:10,537 --> 05:13:11,171
CLEAR AND THAT ENTIRE LIST 

4895
05:13:11,171 --> 05:13:11,838
PREPARED, THAT THIS WAS A GUY 

4896
05:13:11,838 --> 05:13:12,472
THAT SPOKE DIRECTLY TOWARDS A 

4897
05:13:12,472 --> 05:13:13,073
VIEW OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER, 

4898
05:13:13,073 --> 05:13:13,607
RESIDENTIAL IMMUNITIES. 

4899
05:13:13,607 --> 05:13:14,307
IN THIS PEERLESS TIME WHERE THE 

4900
05:13:14,307 --> 05:13:14,975
PRESIDENT IS THE SUBJECT OF A 

4901
05:13:14,975 --> 05:13:15,642
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, HE WAS 

4902
05:13:15,642 --> 05:13:16,309
GOING TO PROTECT THAT PRESIDENT 

4903
05:13:16,309 --> 05:13:16,743
AND SAID AS MUCH. 

4904
05:13:16,743 --> 05:13:17,344
MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESIDENT 

4905
05:13:17,344 --> 05:13:17,811
WAS ABOVE THE LAW AND 

4906
05:13:17,811 --> 05:13:18,178
ACCOUNTABILITY. 

4907
05:13:18,178 --> 05:13:18,845
AND, SIR, I HAVE LEARNED A LOT. 

4908
05:13:18,845 --> 05:13:19,546
I'M ONE OF THE GUYS ON THE SIDE 

4909
05:13:19,546 --> 05:13:20,080
OF THE AISLE, WHEN MY 

4910
05:13:20,080 --> 05:13:20,680
COLLEAGUES SPEAK, I LISTEN. 

4911
05:13:20,680 --> 05:13:21,348
I TRIED TO GIVE THEM MY FULL 

4912
05:13:21,348 --> 05:13:21,648
ATTENTION. 

4913
05:13:21,648 --> 05:13:22,315
AND I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE, BUT 

4914
05:13:22,315 --> 05:13:22,916
I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM MY 

4915
05:13:22,916 --> 05:13:23,550
COLLEAGUES. AND MY FRIENDSHIPS 

4916
05:13:23,550 --> 05:13:24,251
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, 

4917
05:13:24,251 --> 05:13:24,918
MY SINCERE FRIENDSHIPS -- THERE 

4918
05:13:24,918 --> 05:13:25,585
IS BEEN TIMES I'VE TEXTED BACK 

4919
05:13:25,585 --> 05:13:26,219
AND FORTH WITH PEOPLE ON THE 

4920
05:13:26,219 --> 05:13:26,787
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. 

4921
05:13:26,787 --> 05:13:27,154
I RESPECT THEM. 

4922
05:13:27,154 --> 05:13:27,821
AND I HAVE FOUGHT HARD DURING 

4923
05:13:27,821 --> 05:13:28,155
THIS PROCESS. 

4924
05:13:28,155 --> 05:13:28,789
I HAVE GIVEN IT EVERYTHING I 

4925
05:13:28,789 --> 05:13:28,989
GOT. 

4926
05:13:28,989 --> 05:13:29,656
I HAVE LEARNED THAT GOING BACK 

4927
05:13:29,656 --> 05:13:30,257
TO BEING A FOOTBALL PLAYER. 

4928
05:13:30,257 --> 05:13:30,891
BETWEEN THE WHISTLES YOU FIGHT 

4929
05:13:30,891 --> 05:13:31,591
AS HARD AS YOU CAN FOR WHAT YOU 

4930
05:13:31,591 --> 05:13:31,858
BELIEVE. 

4931
05:13:31,858 --> 05:13:32,459
IF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT 

4932
05:13:32,459 --> 05:13:32,893
PARTISANSHIP, FIND. 

4933
05:13:32,893 --> 05:13:33,160
-- FINE. 

4934
05:13:33,160 --> 05:13:33,794
I HAVE BEEN EXUBERANT IN MY 

4935
05:13:33,794 --> 05:13:34,060
BELIEFS. 

4936
05:13:34,060 --> 05:13:34,594
AND I HAVE LEARNED A LOT 

4937
05:13:34,594 --> 05:13:35,095
THROUGH THIS PROCESS. 

4938
05:13:35,095 --> 05:13:35,762
SOME OF MY COMMENTS HAVE BEEN 

4939
05:13:35,762 --> 05:13:36,430
REFERENCED NUMEROUS TIMES AND I 

4940
05:13:36,430 --> 05:13:37,097
KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN AS 

4941
05:13:37,097 --> 05:13:37,764
PER SIZED AND ALLOWED COMMENTS 

4942
05:13:37,764 --> 05:13:38,298
TO BE MISCHARACTERIZED. 

4943
05:13:38,298 --> 05:13:38,965
AND I DON'T BLAME THOSE PEOPLE. 

4944
05:13:38,965 --> 05:13:39,633
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND HAVE 

4945
05:13:39,633 --> 05:13:40,267
LEARNED TO BE MORE PRECISE. 

4946
05:13:40,267 --> 05:13:40,901
I TALKED TO THESE ISSUES AND 

4947
05:13:40,901 --> 05:13:41,501
VALUES AS MUCH AS I CAN. 

4948
05:13:41,501 --> 05:13:42,135
I TRAVEL AROUND THIS COUNTRY 

4949
05:13:42,135 --> 05:13:42,803
CALLING FOR RESPECT, DIGNITY OF 

4950
05:13:42,803 --> 05:13:43,437
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND 

4951
05:13:43,437 --> 05:13:44,137
RECOGNIZING AS MUCH AS I CAN -- 

4952
05:13:44,137 --> 05:13:44,471
AND I SAY IT. 

4953
05:13:44,471 --> 05:13:45,105
YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY 

4954
05:13:45,105 --> 05:13:45,806
UNLESS YOU LOVE ALL YOUR COUNTRY

4955
05:13:45,806 --> 05:13:46,173
MEN AND WOMEN. 

4956
05:13:46,173 --> 05:13:46,840
THE GOODNESS AND THE DECENCY OF 

4957
05:13:46,840 --> 05:13:47,441
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IS 

4958
05:13:47,441 --> 05:13:48,141
SELF-EVIDENT. WE DEMONIZE EACH 

4959
05:13:48,141 --> 05:13:48,875
OTHER IN WAYS THAT I WILL BE IN 

4960
05:13:48,875 --> 05:13:49,543
CONTINUE TO BE TRYING TO GET 

4961
05:13:49,543 --> 05:13:50,110
THE DIALOGUE TO RISE TO 

4962
05:13:50,110 --> 05:13:50,744
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, TO BE A 

4963
05:13:50,744 --> 05:13:51,445
COUNTRY THAT SEES WE NEED EACH 

4964
05:13:51,445 --> 05:13:51,678
OTHER. 

4965
05:13:51,678 --> 05:13:52,279
THERE IS NO DEMOCRATIC OR 

4966
05:13:52,279 --> 05:13:52,679
REPUBLICAN WAY. 

4967
05:13:52,679 --> 05:13:53,380
THERE IS ONLY AN AMERICAN WAY. 

4968
05:13:53,380 --> 05:13:54,080
SIR, YOU KNOW, -- AND I'VE SAID 

4969
05:13:54,080 --> 05:13:54,681
THIS TO YOU PERSONALLY AND 

4970
05:13:54,681 --> 05:13:55,315
PUBLICLY, IN THE HARDNES IN 

4971
05:13:55,315 --> 05:13:55,882
WHICH I FIGHT, I MADE NO 

4972
05:13:55,882 --> 05:13:56,283
PERSONAL INSULT. 

4973
05:13:56,283 --> 05:13:56,883
THE CHARGES CAME UP AND I SAY 

4974
05:13:56,883 --> 05:13:57,517
SINCERELY THAT I THINK THE WAY 

4975
05:13:57,517 --> 05:13:58,084
THIS PROCESS WAS RUN WAS A 

4976
05:13:58,084 --> 05:13:58,285
SHAM. 

4977
05:13:58,285 --> 05:13:58,819
I USED THAT WORD, SIR. 

4978
05:13:58,819 --> 05:13:59,419
AND IT WAS BECAUSE WE WERE 

4979
05:13:59,419 --> 05:13:59,986
EVALUATING SOMEONE FOR THE 

4980
05:13:59,986 --> 05:14:00,654
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND WITH 

4981
05:14:00,654 --> 05:14:01,221
SUCH A SMALL PART OF HIS 

4982
05:14:01,221 --> 05:14:01,655
RELEVANT PRODUCT. 

4983
05:14:01,655 --> 05:14:02,355
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO MUCH OF 

4984
05:14:02,355 --> 05:14:02,989
HIS WRITING -- APPROXIMATELY 

4985
05:14:02,989 --> 05:14:03,657
90% WAS NOT BEING SEEN BY THIS 

4986
05:14:03,657 --> 05:14:04,324
COMMITTEE AND CONTROLLED BY A 

4987
05:14:04,324 --> 05:14:04,925
PROCESS THAT WAS SO BROKEN. 

4988
05:14:04,925 --> 05:14:05,559
AND THEN, SIR, I VIOLATED THE 

4989
05:14:05,559 --> 05:14:06,193
RULES THAT YOU PUT FORWARD IN 

4990
05:14:06,193 --> 05:14:06,593
THIS COMMITTEE. 

4991
05:14:06,593 --> 05:14:07,160
WILLFULLY AND KNOWINGLY AND 

4992
05:14:07,160 --> 05:14:07,794
ACCEPTING THE CONSEQUENCES OF 

4993
05:14:07,794 --> 05:14:07,994
THAT. 

4994
05:14:07,994 --> 05:14:08,528
AND I DID SO BECAUSE THE 

4995
05:14:08,528 --> 05:14:09,062
DOCUMENTS THAT WERE BEING 

4996
05:14:09,062 --> 05:14:09,629
WITHHELD FROM THE PUBLIC, I 

4997
05:14:09,629 --> 05:14:10,297
FELT THEY HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW. 

4998
05:14:10,297 --> 05:14:10,831
THEY WEREN'T CLASSIFIED. 

4999
05:14:10,831 --> 05:14:11,398
WERE NO NATIONAL SECURITY 

5000
05:14:11,398 --> 05:14:11,631
ISSUES. 

5001
05:14:11,631 --> 05:14:12,232
WE DISAGREED ON THAT, SIR. 

5002
05:14:12,232 --> 05:14:12,833
I LOCKED HORNS WITH PEOPLE 

5003
05:14:12,833 --> 05:14:13,533
ACROSS THE AISLE AND EVEN AFTER 

5004
05:14:13,533 --> 05:14:14,134
ALL THAT, I WAS GRATEFUL FOR 

5005
05:14:14,134 --> 05:14:14,434
THE COMEDY. 

5006
05:14:14,434 --> 05:14:15,101
THE GENTLEMAN SAID I WAS TAUGHT 

5007
05:14:15,101 --> 05:14:15,702
TO HATE THE SIN BUT LOVE THE 

5008
05:14:15,702 --> 05:14:15,969
SINNER. 

5009
05:14:15,969 --> 05:14:16,603
I REALLY LOVE BEING ON THIS 

5010
05:14:16,603 --> 05:14:16,903
COMMITTEE. 

5011
05:14:16,903 --> 05:14:17,204
I LOVE IT. 

5012
05:14:17,204 --> 05:14:17,804
FROM LIVING IN NEWARK, NEW 

5013
05:14:17,804 --> 05:14:18,505
JERSEY, THIS IS WHERE WANTED TO 

5014
05:14:18,505 --> 05:14:18,772
BE, SIR. 

5015
05:14:18,772 --> 05:14:19,439
I WANTED TO BE ON A COMMITTEE 

5016
05:14:19,439 --> 05:14:20,040
THAT DEALT WITH ISSUES OF 

5017
05:14:20,040 --> 05:14:20,674
JUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE 

5018
05:14:20,674 --> 05:14:21,274
WHEN WE SWEAR AN OATH TO 

5019
05:14:21,274 --> 05:14:21,908
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, I 

5020
05:14:21,908 --> 05:14:22,542
DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET AS 

5021
05:14:22,542 --> 05:14:22,843
A COUNTRY. 

5022
05:14:22,843 --> 05:14:23,510
AND I HAVE TO SAY NOW, AS I'M 

5023
05:14:23,510 --> 05:14:24,110
SITTING HERE THAT I DEEPLY 

5024
05:14:24,110 --> 05:14:24,778
RESENT THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW 

5025
05:14:24,778 --> 05:14:25,412
WHEN DR. FORD CAME FORWARD  

5026
05:14:25,412 --> 05:14:25,879
THAT THIS DEALT WITH 

5027
05:14:25,879 --> 05:14:26,546
PARTISANSHIP. THIS HAS SHIFTED 

5028
05:14:26,546 --> 05:14:27,180
THE DEBATE IN THIS COMMITTEE 

5029
05:14:27,180 --> 05:14:27,814
AND IN THIS COUNTRY FROM RAW 

5030
05:14:27,814 --> 05:14:28,448
PARTISANSHIP TO SOMETHING MUCH 

5031
05:14:28,448 --> 05:14:28,715
DEEPER. 

5032
05:14:28,715 --> 05:14:29,316
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR THE 

5033
05:14:29,316 --> 05:14:29,916
RANKING MEMBER. AND I WAS IN 

5034
05:14:29,916 --> 05:14:30,517
THE ROOM WHEN WE DISCUSSED, 

5035
05:14:30,517 --> 05:14:31,117
LITERALLY, HOURS AFTER I WAS 

5036
05:14:31,117 --> 05:14:31,685
MADE AWARE OF THE LETTER 

5037
05:14:31,685 --> 05:14:32,219
EXISTING ABOUT WHAT HER 

5038
05:14:32,219 --> 05:14:32,652
MOTIVATIONS WERE. 

5039
05:14:32,652 --> 05:14:33,320
FORGIVE ME FOR SPEAKING OUT OF 

5040
05:14:33,320 --> 05:14:33,887
TURN IF THE RANKING MEMBER 

5041
05:14:33,887 --> 05:14:34,521
BELIEVES I AM, BUT HER ENTIRE 

5042
05:14:34,521 --> 05:14:35,155
SENSE OF DECENCY AND HONOR HAD 

5043
05:14:35,155 --> 05:14:35,789
NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS. 

5044
05:14:35,789 --> 05:14:36,389
POLITICS WAS NOT MENTIONED. 

5045
05:14:36,389 --> 05:14:36,990
HER ENTIRE CONCERN WAS ABOUT 

5046
05:14:36,990 --> 05:14:37,591
THE DIGNITY AND HUMIDITY AND 

5047
05:14:37,591 --> 05:14:38,158
THE RESPECT FOR DR. FORD.  

5048
05:14:38,158 --> 05:14:38,758
THE CONVERSATION WE HAD WAS 

5049
05:14:38,758 --> 05:14:39,392
ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE 

5050
05:14:39,392 --> 05:14:40,026
THE INFORMATION THAT WAS JUST 

5051
05:14:40,026 --> 05:14:40,594
PRESENTED TO ALL OF US. 

5052
05:14:40,594 --> 05:14:41,228
I HAVE NOW BEEN IN NUMEROUS 

5053
05:14:41,228 --> 05:14:41,895
MEETINGS WERE POLITICS HAS NOT 

5054
05:14:41,895 --> 05:14:42,262
BEEN DISCUSSED. 

5055
05:14:42,262 --> 05:14:42,929
-- WHERE POLITICS HAS NOT BEEN 

5056
05:14:42,929 --> 05:14:43,230
DISCUSSED. 

5057
05:14:43,230 --> 05:14:43,864
THERE BEEN SOME OF THE MOST 

5058
05:14:43,864 --> 05:14:44,564
ELOQUENT SPEAKING S OF -- I'VE 

5059
05:14:44,564 --> 05:14:45,198
HEARD COLLEAGUES READ LETTERS 

5060
05:14:45,198 --> 05:14:45,799
THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY 

5061
05:14:45,799 --> 05:14:46,366
AMERICANS WHO ARE CONCERNED 

5062
05:14:46,366 --> 05:14:46,800
ABOUT THIS ISSUE. 

5063
05:14:46,800 --> 05:14:47,434
THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT 

5064
05:14:47,434 --> 05:14:47,834
FOR THE COUNTRY. 

5065
05:14:47,834 --> 05:14:48,468
BACK IN THE EARLY 1990S, I WAS 

5066
05:14:48,468 --> 05:14:49,135
A STUDENT DURING THE ANITA HILL 

5067
05:14:49,135 --> 05:14:49,736
CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS. 

5068
05:14:49,736 --> 05:14:50,337
AND I THINK THERE PEOPLE ON 

5069
05:14:50,337 --> 05:14:50,971
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THAT 

5070
05:14:50,971 --> 05:14:51,538
AGREED THAT WAS DEALT WITH 

5071
05:14:51,538 --> 05:14:51,805
WRONGLY. 

5072
05:14:51,805 --> 05:14:52,472
THE PROX US -- PROCESS DID NOT 

5073
05:14:52,472 --> 05:14:53,106
MERIT THE DIGNITY AND DECENCY 

5074
05:14:53,106 --> 05:14:53,773
OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED ARE OF 

5075
05:14:53,773 --> 05:14:54,441
THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 

5076
05:14:54,441 --> 05:14:55,075
YET, THAT INVOLVED MULTIPLE 

5077
05:14:55,075 --> 05:14:55,375
HEARINGS. 

5078
05:14:55,375 --> 05:14:55,876
THAT INVOLVED MULTIPLE 

5079
05:14:55,876 --> 05:14:56,176
WITNESSES. 

5080
05:14:56,176 --> 05:14:56,676
THAT INVOLVED AN FBI 

5081
05:14:56,676 --> 05:14:57,043
INVESTIGATION. 

5082
05:14:57,043 --> 05:14:57,711
AND YET WE STILL CRITICIZE THAT 

5083
05:14:57,711 --> 05:14:57,978
PROCESS. 

5084
05:14:57,978 --> 05:14:58,612
NOW WE ARE HERE TODAY AND WE 

5085
05:14:58,612 --> 05:14:59,246
HAVE FALLEN EVEN FAR SHORT OF 

5086
05:14:59,246 --> 05:14:59,779
WHAT I BELIEVED WAS AN 

5087
05:14:59,779 --> 05:15:00,213
INADEQUATE PROCESS. 

5088
05:15:00,213 --> 05:15:00,747
SIR, THIS IS NOT ABOUT 

5089
05:15:00,747 --> 05:15:01,114
PARTISANSHIP. 

5090
05:15:01,114 --> 05:15:01,748
AND A LOT OF FOLKS ARE TRYING 

5091
05:15:01,748 --> 05:15:02,415
TO MAKE THIS ABOUT THE -- IF 

5092
05:15:02,415 --> 05:15:03,116
SHE WAS FLYING TO CALIFORNIA OR 

5093
05:15:03,116 --> 05:15:03,316
NOT. 

5094
05:15:03,316 --> 05:15:04,017
IF THE LETTER WAS AUTHORIZED TO 

5095
05:15:04,017 --> 05:15:04,518
BE RELEASED OR NOT. 

5096
05:15:04,518 --> 05:15:05,185
IF THE PROCESS SERVED HER NOT. 

5097
05:15:05,185 --> 05:15:05,886
THAT SEEMS TO BE STRIPPING AWAY 

5098
05:15:05,886 --> 05:15:06,520
THE HEROISM OF DR. FORD  TO 

5099
05:15:06,520 --> 05:15:07,120
COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE 

5100
05:15:07,120 --> 05:15:07,587
WILLINGLY EVEN UNDER 

5101
05:15:07,587 --> 05:15:08,188
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE SAID 

5102
05:15:08,188 --> 05:15:08,822
HERSELF WERE NOT HER WISHES. 

5103
05:15:08,822 --> 05:15:09,289
SHE ASKED FOR AN FBI 

5104
05:15:09,289 --> 05:15:09,656
INVESTIGATION. 

5105
05:15:09,656 --> 05:15:10,257
SHE HAS FOR MORE WITNESSES. 

5106
05:15:10,257 --> 05:15:10,924
SHE WASN'T GIVEN THAT SHE STILL 

5107
05:15:10,924 --> 05:15:11,458
CAME HER SET BEFORE THE 

5108
05:15:11,458 --> 05:15:11,758
COMMITTEE. 

5109
05:15:11,758 --> 05:15:12,359
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY, SIR? 

5110
05:15:12,359 --> 05:15:12,893
WHEN SOMEONE WHO HAS THE 

5111
05:15:12,893 --> 05:15:13,560
COURAGE TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE 

5112
05:15:13,560 --> 05:15:14,160
MOST POWERFUL BODIES IN THE 

5113
05:15:14,160 --> 05:15:14,728
LAND, WHAT DID SHE SAY? 

5114
05:15:14,728 --> 05:15:15,362
SHE SHARED A RAW AND VISCERAL 

5115
05:15:15,362 --> 05:15:16,029
INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY WITH THIS 

5116
05:15:16,029 --> 05:15:16,663
COMMITTEE AND THE WORLD AND SHE 

5117
05:15:16,663 --> 05:15:17,030
WAS BELIEVABLE. 

5118
05:15:17,030 --> 05:15:17,397
I BELIEVE HER. 

5119
05:15:17,397 --> 05:15:18,031
SHE TOLD US OF HER INDELIBLE 

5120
05:15:18,031 --> 05:15:18,698
MEMORY, USING WORDS LIKE SEARED 

5121
05:15:18,698 --> 05:15:19,099
INTO HER MEMORY. 

5122
05:15:19,099 --> 05:15:19,799
SPEAKING TO BRAIN CHEMISTRY -- 

5123
05:15:19,799 --> 05:15:20,333
SHE SPOKE OF UPROARIOUS 

5124
05:15:20,333 --> 05:15:20,967
LAUGHTER  OF BRETT KAVANAUGH 

5125
05:15:20,967 --> 05:15:21,635
AND  MARK JUDGE. BEING PINNED 

5126
05:15:21,635 --> 05:15:22,335
TO A BED, BEING -- HANDOVER THE 

5127
05:15:22,335 --> 05:15:22,903
MOST, FEARING FOR HER LIFE. 

5128
05:15:22,903 --> 05:15:23,470
SHE WAS TERRIFIED OF BEING 

5129
05:15:23,470 --> 05:15:24,104
RAPED OR ACCIDENTALLY KILLED. 

5130
05:15:24,104 --> 05:15:24,738
WHEN ASKED BY THIS COMMITTEE 

5131
05:15:24,738 --> 05:15:25,372
WHAT LEVEL OF CERTAINTY, THIS 

5132
05:15:25,372 --> 05:15:25,772
WAS I DON'T KNOW. 

5133
05:15:25,772 --> 05:15:26,206
I'M NOT 100% SURE. 

5134
05:15:26,206 --> 05:15:26,773
SHE SAID I AM 100 PERCENT 

5135
05:15:26,773 --> 05:15:27,474
CERTAIN -- 100% CERTAIN IT WAS 

5136
05:15:27,474 --> 05:15:27,908
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  

5137
05:15:27,908 --> 05:15:28,575
IT WAS SEARED INTO HER MEMORY. 

5138
05:15:28,575 --> 05:15:28,942
SHE KNOWS 100%. 

5139
05:15:28,942 --> 05:15:29,543
THAT'S CREDIBLE BECAUSE SHE 

5140
05:15:29,543 --> 05:15:29,843
KNEW HIM. 

5141
05:15:29,843 --> 05:15:30,443
SHE HAD INTERACTED WITH HIM 

5142
05:15:30,443 --> 05:15:30,710
SOCIALLY. 

5143
05:15:30,710 --> 05:15:31,244
BEFORE HE ATTACKED HER. 

5144
05:15:31,244 --> 05:15:31,845
SHE DIDN'T NEED TO PICK A 

5145
05:15:31,845 --> 05:15:32,245
MODIFIED LINEUP. 

5146
05:15:32,245 --> 05:15:32,779
-- HIM OUT OF A LINEUP. 

5147
05:15:32,779 --> 05:15:33,146
SHE KNEW HIM. 

5148
05:15:33,146 --> 05:15:33,780
THIS IS NOT STAND ON ITS OWN. 

5149
05:15:33,780 --> 05:15:34,447
IT IS BOLSTERED BY SIGNIFICANT 

5150
05:15:34,447 --> 05:15:34,781
CORROBARATE.  

5151
05:15:34,781 --> 05:15:35,515
IN 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 SHE 

5152
05:15:35,515 --> 05:15:35,849
SPOKE OF IT. 

5153
05:15:35,849 --> 05:15:36,516
SHE TOLD TO FIVE PEOPLE LONG 

5154
05:15:36,516 --> 05:15:37,117
BEFORE JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS  

5155
05:15:37,117 --> 05:15:37,817
NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT. 

5156
05:15:37,817 --> 05:15:38,485
SHE TOLD MULTIPLE PEOPLE THAT 

5157
05:15:38,485 --> 05:15:39,119
SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 

5158
05:15:39,119 --> 05:15:39,486
AS A TEENAGER. 

5159
05:15:39,486 --> 05:15:40,153
SHE IDENTIFIED HIM SPECIFICALLY 

5160
05:15:40,153 --> 05:15:40,687
NAME IN SOME INSTANCES. 

5161
05:15:40,687 --> 05:15:41,288
IN OTHERS SHE DESCRIBED HER 

5162
05:15:41,288 --> 05:15:41,888
ATTACKER AS A FEDERAL JUDGE. 

5163
05:15:41,888 --> 05:15:42,522
EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE 

5164
05:15:42,522 --> 05:15:43,156
PROVIDED THIS COMMITTEE WITH 

5165
05:15:43,156 --> 05:15:43,657
THEIR SWORN STATEMENTS 

5166
05:15:43,657 --> 05:15:44,224
ATTESTING TO THESE FACTS. 

5167
05:15:44,224 --> 05:15:44,791
WE COULD'VE CALLED THOSE 

5168
05:15:44,791 --> 05:15:45,392
INDIVIDUALS TO TESTIFY THAT 

5169
05:15:45,392 --> 05:15:46,092
THIS WAS NOT WHAT I HAVE HEARD. 

5170
05:15:46,092 --> 05:15:46,660
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE 

5171
05:15:46,660 --> 05:15:47,861
CLINTONS AND ALL THE OTHER úALL 

5172
05:15:47,861 --> 05:15:48,495
IN THE EARLY YEARS HAD TALKED 

5173
05:15:48,495 --> 05:15:48,995
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH  

5174
05:15:48,995 --> 05:15:49,396
ASSAULTING HER. 

5175
05:15:49,396 --> 05:15:49,996
IT'S NOT A POLITICAL ATTACK. 

5176
05:15:49,996 --> 05:15:50,597
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH HER 

5177
05:15:50,597 --> 05:15:51,164
STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN 

5178
05:15:51,164 --> 05:15:51,898
CORROBARATE  D AND DR. FORD'S  

5179
05:15:51,898 --> 05:15:52,566
ATTACK IS ALSO COOPERATED WITH 

5180
05:15:52,566 --> 05:15:52,999
INDEPENDENT FACTS. 

5181
05:15:52,999 --> 05:15:53,667
THEY WERE FRIENDS OF KAVANAUGH  

5182
05:15:53,667 --> 05:15:54,401
AND PRESENT IS CORROBARATE  T --

5183
05:15:54,401 --> 05:15:54,734
CORROBRATED. 

5184
05:15:54,734 --> 05:15:55,335
DR. FORD  TESTIFIED SHORTLY 

5185
05:15:55,335 --> 05:15:55,969
AFTER THE ASSAULT, AROUND SIX 

5186
05:15:55,969 --> 05:15:56,603
TO EIGHT WEEKS LATER SHE RAN 

5187
05:15:56,603 --> 05:15:57,203
INTO MARK JUDGE AT A LOCAL 

5188
05:15:57,203 --> 05:15:57,571
GROCERY STORE. 

5189
05:15:57,571 --> 05:15:58,271
AND HE SEEMED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE

5190
05:15:58,271 --> 05:15:58,605
TO SEE HER. 

5191
05:15:58,605 --> 05:15:59,172
IN HIS BOOK, MARK JUDGE 

5192
05:15:59,172 --> 05:15:59,806
DESCRIBED WORKING AT A LOCAL 

5193
05:15:59,806 --> 05:16:00,473
GROCERY STORE IN THE SUMMER OF 

5194
05:16:00,473 --> 05:16:00,707
1982. 

5195
05:16:00,707 --> 05:16:01,274
IT IS ALL CONSISTENT. THE 

5196
05:16:01,274 --> 05:16:01,975
CIRCUMSTANCES ALSO SUPPORT HER. 

5197
05:16:01,975 --> 05:16:02,576
FIRST SHE MADE CONTACT WITH 

5198
05:16:02,576 --> 05:16:03,243
ELECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES BEFORE 

5199
05:16:03,243 --> 05:16:03,777
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS EVEN 

5200
05:16:03,777 --> 05:16:04,110
NOMINATED.  

5201
05:16:04,110 --> 05:16:04,744
THIS ISN'T SOME POLITICAL HIT 

5202
05:16:04,744 --> 05:16:05,312
JOB. BEFORE HE WAS EVEN 

5203
05:16:05,312 --> 05:16:05,912
NOMINATED, SHE CAME FORWARD 

5204
05:16:05,912 --> 05:16:06,413
WITH THIS TESTIMONY. 

5205
05:16:06,413 --> 05:16:07,047
THE SECOND SHE SUBMITTED TO A 

5206
05:16:07,047 --> 05:16:07,647
LENGTHY, EMOTIONAL POLYGRAPH 

5207
05:16:07,647 --> 05:16:08,315
RECORD -- WE DIDN'T CALL FOR 

5208
05:16:08,315 --> 05:16:09,015
THE TESTER TO SIT BEFORE US SO 

5209
05:16:09,015 --> 05:16:09,549
WE COULD QUESTION HIM. 

5210
05:16:09,549 --> 05:16:10,183
THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT SHE 

5211
05:16:10,183 --> 05:16:10,817
WAS TRUTHFUL. AND IT IS NOW 

5212
05:16:10,817 --> 05:16:11,284
PART OF THE RECORD. 

5213
05:16:11,284 --> 05:16:11,885
NUMBER THREE, SHE REPORTEDLY 

5214
05:16:11,885 --> 05:16:12,485
CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION 

5215
05:16:12,485 --> 05:16:12,886
INTO THE CLAIMS. 

5216
05:16:12,886 --> 05:16:13,520
FULLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT 

5217
05:16:13,520 --> 05:16:14,154
COULD SUBJECT HER TO CRIMINAL 

5218
05:16:14,154 --> 05:16:14,454
PENALTIES. 

5219
05:16:14,454 --> 05:16:15,155
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHEN 

5220
05:16:15,155 --> 05:16:15,822
YOU GET A CALL FROM A COMMITTEE 

5221
05:16:15,822 --> 05:16:16,389
STAFFER OR PARTISAN STAFFER 

5222
05:16:16,389 --> 05:16:17,057
VERSUS WHEN YOU GET A CALL FROM 

5223
05:16:17,057 --> 05:16:17,324
THE FBI. 

5224
05:16:17,324 --> 05:16:17,958
LYING TO THEM IS A FELONY. 

5225
05:16:17,958 --> 05:16:18,625
THAT IS A POWERFUL DIFFERENCE 

5226
05:16:18,625 --> 05:16:19,059
BETWEEN A COMMITTEE 

5227
05:16:19,059 --> 05:16:19,726
INVESTIGATION AND AN FBI AGENT 

5228
05:16:19,726 --> 05:16:20,327
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE, CHASING 

5229
05:16:20,327 --> 05:16:20,894
AFTER FACTS, PULLING ON THE 

5230
05:16:20,894 --> 05:16:21,528
LOOSE THREADS THAT HAVE BEEN 

5231
05:16:21,528 --> 05:16:22,162
EVIDENT IN JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  

5232
05:16:22,162 --> 05:16:22,395
RECORD. 

5233
05:16:22,395 --> 05:16:22,929
FOURTH, SHE CAME FORWARD 

5234
05:16:22,929 --> 05:16:23,563
PUBLICLY DESPITE KNOWING SHE 

5235
05:16:23,563 --> 05:16:24,130
WOULD FACE HARSH PUBLIC 

5236
05:16:24,130 --> 05:16:24,764
SCRUTINY, THREATS, RELENTLESS 

5237
05:16:24,764 --> 05:16:25,265
INVASIONS OF PRIVACY. 

5238
05:16:25,265 --> 05:16:25,832
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE 

5239
05:16:25,832 --> 05:16:26,466
EFFECT ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHICH 

5240
05:16:26,466 --> 05:16:27,133
IS REAL  AND NOT EXAGGERATED. 

5241
05:16:27,133 --> 05:16:27,801
BUT THE EFFECT ON HER AS WELL, 

5242
05:16:27,801 --> 05:16:28,468
AND WHAT SHE HAD TO SUBMIT TO 

5243
05:16:28,468 --> 05:16:29,069
BY COMING FORWARD AND MAKING 

5244
05:16:29,069 --> 05:16:29,669
THAT COURAGEOUS TESTIMONY. 

5245
05:16:29,669 --> 05:16:30,337
NOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  TESTIMONY

5246
05:16:30,337 --> 05:16:31,037
STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO DR. 

5247
05:16:31,037 --> 05:16:31,471
FORD'S TESTIMONY. 

5248
05:16:31,471 --> 05:16:32,005
FIRST JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS 

5249
05:16:32,005 --> 05:16:32,639
EVERYTHING TO LOSE  SHOULD 

5250
05:16:32,639 --> 05:16:33,306
THESE BE FULLY INVESTIGATED AND 

5251
05:16:33,306 --> 05:16:33,640
PROVEN TRUE. 

5252
05:16:33,640 --> 05:16:34,107
EVERYTHING TO LOSE. 

5253
05:16:34,107 --> 05:16:34,741
THAT'S WHY HE DOESN'T WANT A 

5254
05:16:34,741 --> 05:16:35,175
FULL INVESTIGATION. 

5255
05:16:35,175 --> 05:16:35,842
SECONDLY, HE HAS GIVEN NUMEROUS 

5256
05:16:35,842 --> 05:16:36,443
OPPORTUNITIES TIME AND TIME 

5257
05:16:36,443 --> 05:16:36,977
AGAIN TO CALL FOR AN FBI 

5258
05:16:36,977 --> 05:16:37,644
INVESTIGATION, AND IN BENEFIT --

5259
05:16:37,644 --> 05:16:38,244
AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION 

5260
05:16:38,244 --> 05:16:38,878
BUT HE IS REFUSED TO DO SO. 

5261
05:16:38,878 --> 05:16:39,546
IF I WAS IN THE BALANCE AND BE 

5262
05:16:39,546 --> 05:16:40,180
ACCUSED OF THINGS THAT WERE 

5263
05:16:40,180 --> 05:16:40,780
ALLIES, I WOULD BE DEMANDING 

5264
05:16:40,780 --> 05:16:41,381
EVERY BIT OF INVESTIGATION 

5265
05:16:41,381 --> 05:16:41,648
POSSIBLE. 

5266
05:16:41,648 --> 05:16:42,082
NOT JUST THE FBI. 

5267
05:16:42,082 --> 05:16:42,582
I WOULD BE CALLING FOR 

5268
05:16:42,582 --> 05:16:43,149
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS. 

5269
05:16:43,149 --> 05:16:43,750
I WOULD BE CALLING ON EVERY 

5270
05:16:43,750 --> 05:16:44,084
LOOSE THREAD. 

5271
05:16:44,084 --> 05:16:44,484
BUT HE HAS NOT. 

5272
05:16:44,484 --> 05:16:45,185
HE HAS REFUSED TO CALL FOR THIS 

5273
05:16:45,185 --> 05:16:45,685
COMMITTEE TO HEAR LIVE 

5274
05:16:45,685 --> 05:16:46,319
TESTIMONY FROM WITNESSES THAT 

5275
05:16:46,319 --> 05:16:47,020
COULD CORROBARATE  HIS STORY OR 

5276
05:16:47,020 --> 05:16:47,354
DR. FORD'S.  

5277
05:16:47,354 --> 05:16:47,988
THIRD, HIS TESTIMONY REGARDING 

5278
05:16:47,988 --> 05:16:48,622
HIS DRINKING HABITS HAVE BEEN 

5279
05:16:48,622 --> 05:16:49,322
CONTRADICTED BY SO MANY PEOPLE. 

5280
05:16:49,322 --> 05:16:49,990
HIS STATEMENTS HAVE PROVEN TO BE

5281
05:16:49,990 --> 05:16:50,290
NOT TRUE. 

5282
05:16:50,290 --> 05:16:50,991
HIS ROOMMATE HAS SAID THAT HE 

5283
05:16:50,991 --> 05:16:51,558
WAS FREQUENTLY INCOHERENTLY 

5284
05:16:51,558 --> 05:16:52,158
DRUNK AND THAT HE BECAME 

5285
05:16:52,158 --> 05:16:52,759
AGGRESSIVE AND BELLIGERENT. 

5286
05:16:52,759 --> 05:16:53,393
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT 

5287
05:16:53,393 --> 05:16:53,727
SAID THAT'S. 

5288
05:16:53,727 --> 05:16:54,361
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  FRIEND TO 

5289
05:16:54,361 --> 05:16:54,995
WHOM HE REFERRED TO NUMEROUS 

5290
05:16:54,995 --> 05:16:55,629
TIMES SAID IS NOT CREDIBLE FOR 

5291
05:16:55,629 --> 05:16:56,296
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO SAY THAT HE 

5292
05:16:56,296 --> 05:16:56,963
HAS NO MEMORY  LAPSES IN THE 

5293
05:16:56,963 --> 05:16:57,664
NIGHTS THAT HE DRINK TO EXCESS. 

5294
05:16:57,664 --> 05:16:58,298
AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS, MR. 

5295
05:16:58,298 --> 05:16:58,965
CHAIRMAN, LYNN BROOKS WHO SAID 

5296
05:16:58,965 --> 05:16:59,532
SHE DID NOT WANT TO COME 

5297
05:16:59,532 --> 05:17:00,166
FORWARD, ANOTHER FRIEND FROM 

5298
05:17:00,166 --> 05:17:00,834
YALE, SHE IS A REPUBLICAN, MR. 

5299
05:17:00,834 --> 05:17:01,468
CHAIRMAN. SHE DID NOT WANT TO 

5300
05:17:01,468 --> 05:17:02,068
COME FORWARD BUT LAST NIGHT 

5301
05:17:02,068 --> 05:17:02,569
AFTER LISTENING TO HIS 

5302
05:17:02,569 --> 05:17:03,236
TESTIMONY, WAS SO OFFENDED BY 

5303
05:17:03,236 --> 05:17:03,937
HIS LIES THAT THIS IS WHAT HIS 

5304
05:17:03,937 --> 05:17:04,571
FRIEND FROM YALE, A REGISTERED 

5305
05:17:04,571 --> 05:17:05,205
REPUBLICAN SAID, THERE IS NO 

5306
05:17:05,205 --> 05:17:05,905
DOUBT IN MY MIND WHILE AT YALE 

5307
05:17:05,905 --> 05:17:06,573
HE WAS A BIG PARTY OR. HE OFTEN 

5308
05:17:06,573 --> 05:17:06,973
DRINK TO EXCESS. 

5309
05:17:06,973 --> 05:17:07,674
AND THERE HAD TO BE A NUMBER OF 

5310
05:17:07,674 --> 05:17:08,308
NIGHTS HE DOES NOT REMEMBER. 

5311
05:17:08,308 --> 05:17:08,975
IN FACT, I WAS WITNESSED TO THE 

5312
05:17:08,975 --> 05:17:09,609
NIGHT HE GOT TAPPED INTO HIS 

5313
05:17:09,609 --> 05:17:10,210
FRATERNITY AND WAS STUMBLING 

5314
05:17:10,210 --> 05:17:10,877
DRUNK AND HE WAS IN A RIDICULOUS

5315
05:17:10,877 --> 05:17:11,544
-- SAYING REALLY DUMB THINGS. 

5316
05:17:11,544 --> 05:17:12,145
I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE THAT 

5317
05:17:12,145 --> 05:17:12,712
THERE IS NO WAY THAT HE 

5318
05:17:12,712 --> 05:17:13,213
REMEMBERS THAT NIGHT. 

5319
05:17:13,213 --> 05:17:13,880
THIS IS A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN 

5320
05:17:13,880 --> 05:17:14,447
WHO DID NOT WANT TO COME 

5321
05:17:14,447 --> 05:17:14,714
FORWARD. 

5322
05:17:14,714 --> 05:17:15,382
THERE WERE MULTIPLE EMAILS AND 

5323
05:17:15,382 --> 05:17:15,949
TEXT CIRCLING AMONGST HER 

5324
05:17:15,949 --> 05:17:16,583
CLASSMATES ABOUT HOW KAVANAUGH 

5325
05:17:16,583 --> 05:17:17,250
WAS QUOTE  LYING TO THE SENATE 

5326
05:17:17,250 --> 05:17:17,851
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  IN HIS 

5327
05:17:17,851 --> 05:17:18,151
TESTIMONY. 

5328
05:17:18,151 --> 05:17:18,785
THAT'S FROM A REPUBLICAN WHO 

5329
05:17:18,785 --> 05:17:19,419
DID NOT WANT TO COME FORWARD 

5330
05:17:19,419 --> 05:17:20,053
UNTIL SHE WITNESSED THOSE LIES. 

5331
05:17:20,053 --> 05:17:20,620
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S  

5332
05:17:20,620 --> 05:17:21,221
TESTIMONY OSTOMATE -- ALSO 

5333
05:17:21,221 --> 05:17:21,821
MISCHARACTERIZED WHAT THREE 

5334
05:17:21,821 --> 05:17:22,355
OTHER PEOPLE INDICATED. 

5335
05:17:22,355 --> 05:17:22,989
HE TOLD US AS HIS EXONERATING 

5336
05:17:22,989 --> 05:17:23,690
EVIDENCE -- HE KEPT MENTIONING 

5337
05:17:23,690 --> 05:17:24,024
THREE NAMES. 

5338
05:17:24,024 --> 05:17:24,658
HE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT FOUR 

5339
05:17:24,658 --> 05:17:25,358
PEOPLE WHO KNEW DR. FORD  WHO 

5340
05:17:25,358 --> 05:17:26,026
DR. FORD SAID WAS PRESENT  AT 

5341
05:17:26,026 --> 05:17:26,660
THE GATHERING SAID IT DIDN'T 

5342
05:17:26,660 --> 05:17:26,926
HAPPEN. 

5343
05:17:26,926 --> 05:17:27,460
THAT'S PATENTLY UNTRUE. 

5344
05:17:27,460 --> 05:17:28,061
MARK JUDGE SAID I HAVE NO 

5345
05:17:28,061 --> 05:17:28,728
MEMORY OF THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT.

5346
05:17:28,728 --> 05:17:29,295
PJ SMITH SAID HE HAS NO 

5347
05:17:29,295 --> 05:17:29,963
KNOWLEDGE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS. 

5348
05:17:29,963 --> 05:17:30,664
THAT IS NOT, IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 

5349
05:17:30,664 --> 05:17:31,297
LELAND KAISER HAS SAID THROUGH 

5350
05:17:31,297 --> 05:17:31,831
HER ATTORNEY SHE HAS NO 

5351
05:17:31,831 --> 05:17:32,432
RECOLLECTION OF BEING AT A 

5352
05:17:32,432 --> 05:17:32,966
PARTY OR GATHERING WHEN 

5353
05:17:32,966 --> 05:17:33,600
KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT . THAT 

5354
05:17:33,600 --> 05:17:34,200
WAS NOT, IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 

5355
05:17:34,200 --> 05:17:34,901
IN FACT, LELAND KAISER HAS SAID 

5356
05:17:34,901 --> 05:17:35,435
SHE BELIEVES DR. FORD.  

5357
05:17:35,435 --> 05:17:36,102
THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS DENIED 

5358
05:17:36,102 --> 05:17:36,770
THIS IS TAKEN PLACE WHO SAYS IT 

5359
05:17:36,770 --> 05:17:37,303
DID NOT HAPPEN IS JUDGE 

5360
05:17:37,303 --> 05:17:37,604
KAVANAUGH.  

5361
05:17:37,604 --> 05:17:38,238
AND SO NOW THIS IS THE REAL 

5362
05:17:38,238 --> 05:17:38,605
POINT, SERVE. 

5363
05:17:38,605 --> 05:17:38,972
>> CAN YOU -- 

5364
05:17:38,972 --> 05:17:39,572
>> I WOULD LIKE TO FINISH, 

5365
05:17:39,572 --> 05:17:39,806
SERVE. 

5366
05:17:39,806 --> 05:17:40,073
-- SIR. 

5367
05:17:40,073 --> 05:17:40,674
>> YOU'VE GONE 70 MINUTES. 

5368
05:17:40,674 --> 05:17:41,307
I HAVE THREE OTHER PEOPLE WHO 

5369
05:17:41,307 --> 05:17:41,775
WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. 

5370
05:17:41,775 --> 05:17:42,409
>> I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE. 

5371
05:17:42,409 --> 05:17:43,009
ARE YOU WILLING TO LET THREE 

5372
05:17:43,009 --> 05:17:43,443
OTHER PEOPLE SPEAK? 

5373
05:17:43,443 --> 05:17:44,177
>> I WANT TO FINISH MY COMMENTS.

5374
05:17:44,177 --> 05:17:44,744
YOU CAN LET WHOEVER SPEAK, 

5375
05:17:44,744 --> 05:17:44,978
SPEAK. 

5376
05:17:44,978 --> 05:17:45,412
>> GO AHEAD, SIR. 

5377
05:17:45,412 --> 05:17:45,945
>> HE CAN TAKE MY TIME. 

5378
05:17:45,945 --> 05:17:46,579
>> THIS NATION IS WATCHING. 

5379
05:17:46,579 --> 05:17:47,247
WHICH IS SAW ONE REPUBLICAN SO 

5380
05:17:47,247 --> 05:17:47,814
OFFENDED BECAUSE SHE KNOWS 

5381
05:17:47,814 --> 05:17:48,114
KAVANAUGH.  

5382
05:17:48,114 --> 05:17:48,715
THIS IS AMERICANS WATCHING 

5383
05:17:48,715 --> 05:17:49,416
RIGHT NOW TO SEE WHAT THIS BODY 

5384
05:17:49,416 --> 05:17:49,683
WILL DO. 

5385
05:17:49,683 --> 05:17:50,316
THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS OR 

5386
05:17:50,316 --> 05:17:50,650
PARTISANSHIP. 

5387
05:17:50,650 --> 05:17:51,284
I WILL FOREVER REMEMBER WHAT 

5388
05:17:51,284 --> 05:17:51,918
DR. FORD SAID WHEN SHE CAME 

5389
05:17:51,918 --> 05:17:52,218
BEFORE US. 

5390
05:17:52,218 --> 05:17:52,852
SHE WAS PERFORMING FOR CIVIC  

5391
05:17:52,852 --> 05:17:53,053
DUTY. 

5392
05:17:53,053 --> 05:17:53,720
SHE WASN'T TRYING TO DESTROY A 

5393
05:17:53,720 --> 05:17:53,920
MAN. 

5394
05:17:53,920 --> 05:17:54,487
SHE WAS A COURAGEOUS WOMAN 

5395
05:17:54,487 --> 05:17:55,088
TELLING HER TRUTH OF SEXUAL 

5396
05:17:55,088 --> 05:17:55,722
ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 

5397
05:17:55,722 --> 05:17:56,389
THIS IS WHAT WAS DONE TO ME, 

5398
05:17:56,389 --> 05:17:56,690
SHE SAYS. 

5399
05:17:56,690 --> 05:17:57,390
MANY COLLEAGUES SAID THEY FOUND 

5400
05:17:57,390 --> 05:17:57,824
DR. FORD CREDIBLE. 

5401
05:17:57,824 --> 05:17:58,491
BUT TO CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

5402
05:17:58,491 --> 05:17:59,092
YOU WOULD SAY THAT YOU DON'T 

5403
05:17:59,092 --> 05:17:59,726
BELIEVE HER ,  DR. FORD , BUT 

5404
05:17:59,726 --> 05:18:00,360
THAT YOU ARE SO CERTAIN THIS 

5405
05:18:00,360 --> 05:18:00,927
DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT YOU ARE 

5406
05:18:00,927 --> 05:18:01,528
WILLING TO FORCE A VOTE NOW 

5407
05:18:01,528 --> 05:18:01,961
WITHOUT ANY FURTHER 

5408
05:18:01,961 --> 05:18:02,328
INVESTIGATION. 

5409
05:18:02,328 --> 05:18:02,962
AT BEST, THIS MEANS YOU THINK 

5410
05:18:02,962 --> 05:18:03,563
SHE WAS CONFUSED AND DOESN'T 

5411
05:18:03,563 --> 05:18:04,164
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. 

5412
05:18:04,164 --> 05:18:04,831
EVEN THOUGH YESTERDAY SHE TOLD 

5413
05:18:04,831 --> 05:18:05,331
US SHE REMEMBERS BRETT 

5414
05:18:05,331 --> 05:18:05,965
KAVANAUGH  COVERING HER MOUTH 

5415
05:18:05,965 --> 05:18:06,499
SEARED INTO HER MEMORY, 

5416
05:18:06,499 --> 05:18:07,167
EXPRESSING FEAR THAT HE MIGHT 

5417
05:18:07,167 --> 05:18:07,701
ACCIDENTALLY KILL HER. 

5418
05:18:07,701 --> 05:18:08,368
SHE TOLD US DETAILS FROM 2012, 

5419
05:18:08,368 --> 05:18:08,902
2013, 2016, AND 2017. 

5420
05:18:08,902 --> 05:18:09,536
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE IN THE 

5421
05:18:09,536 --> 05:18:10,103
UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW. 

5422
05:18:10,103 --> 05:18:10,737
THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT. 

5423
05:18:10,737 --> 05:18:11,204
IT IS A MORAL MOMENT. 

5424
05:18:11,204 --> 05:18:11,838
WE DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE THIS 

5425
05:18:11,838 --> 05:18:12,172
VOTE TODAY. 

5426
05:18:12,172 --> 05:18:12,706
WE CAN CORRECT FROM THE 

5427
05:18:12,706 --> 05:18:13,373
MISTAKES OF THE PAST IN THIS 

5428
05:18:13,373 --> 05:18:13,640
NATION. 

5429
05:18:13,640 --> 05:18:14,274
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, 

5430
05:18:14,274 --> 05:18:14,874
MEN AND WOMEN, SURVIVORS OF 

5431
05:18:14,874 --> 05:18:15,542
SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO ARE WATCHING 

5432
05:18:15,542 --> 05:18:16,209
THIS BODY OF POWERFUL PEOPLE 

5433
05:18:16,209 --> 05:18:16,710
AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 

5434
05:18:16,710 --> 05:18:17,277
THIS TOXIC CULTURE, THIS 

5435
05:18:17,277 --> 05:18:17,877
PERNICIOUS PATRIARCHY HAS TO 

5436
05:18:17,877 --> 05:18:18,111
STOP. 

5437
05:18:18,111 --> 05:18:18,745
IT IS REAL IN THIS COUNTRY. 

5438
05:18:18,745 --> 05:18:19,245
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. 

5439
05:18:19,245 --> 05:18:19,913
THERE WATCHING THIS BODY RIGHT 

5440
05:18:19,913 --> 05:18:20,113
NOW. 

5441
05:18:20,113 --> 05:18:20,780
CHILDREN ABUSED, WATCHING WHAT 

5442
05:18:20,780 --> 05:18:21,414
PEOPLE SWEEP IT ASIDE, DENY, 

5443
05:18:21,414 --> 05:18:21,681
ATTACK. 

5444
05:18:21,681 --> 05:18:22,382
PEOPLE IN CORPORATIONS OR NEWS 

5445
05:18:22,382 --> 05:18:23,016
MEDIA OUTLETS WHO ARE ABUSED 

5446
05:18:23,016 --> 05:18:23,650
AND HARASSED FOR YEARS AND 

5447
05:18:23,650 --> 05:18:24,250
THEIR TESTIMONY, THEIR TRUTH 

5448
05:18:24,250 --> 05:18:24,851
WAS SWEPT ASIDE, BELITTLED. 

5449
05:18:24,851 --> 05:18:25,318
THEY WERE VILIFIED. 

5450
05:18:25,318 --> 05:18:25,819
THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY 

5451
05:18:25,819 --> 05:18:26,186
INVESTIGATORS. 

5452
05:18:26,186 --> 05:18:26,853
MILLIONS ARE WATCHING THIS BODY 

5453
05:18:26,853 --> 05:18:27,220
AND HOW WE ACT. 

5454
05:18:27,220 --> 05:18:27,887
WILL WE BRUSH ASIDE A CREDIBLE 

5455
05:18:27,887 --> 05:18:28,488
WITNESS TESTIMONY? WILL WE 

5456
05:18:28,488 --> 05:18:29,122
BELITTLE AND ATTACK CREDIBLE 

5457
05:18:29,122 --> 05:18:29,422
TESTIMONY? 

5458
05:18:29,422 --> 05:18:29,923
WILL WE IGNORE CREDIBLE 

5459
05:18:29,923 --> 05:18:30,223
TESTIMONY? 

5460
05:18:30,223 --> 05:18:30,623
WILL WE LISTEN? 

5461
05:18:30,623 --> 05:18:31,024
WILL WE BELIEVE? 

5462
05:18:31,024 --> 05:18:31,725
IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW, 

5463
05:18:31,725 --> 05:18:32,358
THERE ARE DARK CORNERS OF THE 

5464
05:18:32,358 --> 05:18:32,625
CULTURE. 

5465
05:18:32,625 --> 05:18:33,293
THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL 

5466
05:18:33,293 --> 05:18:33,927
REPORTS ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE 

5467
05:18:33,927 --> 05:18:34,527
AMERICAN WOMEN, ONE OUT OF 

5468
05:18:34,527 --> 05:18:35,161
THREE, WILL EXPERIENCE SOME 

5469
05:18:35,161 --> 05:18:35,729
FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. 

5470
05:18:35,729 --> 05:18:36,429
ONE OUT OF SIX MEN. 60% OF THEM 

5471
05:18:36,429 --> 05:18:36,796
GO UNREPORTED. 

5472
05:18:36,796 --> 05:18:37,397
AND THERE ARE THOSE RIGHT NOW 

5473
05:18:37,397 --> 05:18:38,098
WATCHING THIS GROUP OF POWERFUL 

5474
05:18:38,098 --> 05:18:38,798
PEOPLE. HOW WILL WE DEAL WITH A 

5475
05:18:38,798 --> 05:18:39,199
PRIVILEGED MAN? 

5476
05:18:39,199 --> 05:18:39,866
A SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT IS 

5477
05:18:39,866 --> 05:18:40,400
NOT AN ENTITLEMENT. JUST 

5478
05:18:40,400 --> 05:18:41,034
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE CAPTAIN OF 

5479
05:18:41,034 --> 05:18:41,701
YOUR BEST BALL TEAM, THIS IS NOT

5480
05:18:41,701 --> 05:18:42,102
AN ENTITLEMENT. 

5481
05:18:42,102 --> 05:18:42,736
MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS IS NOT A 

5482
05:18:42,736 --> 05:18:43,103
COURT OF LAW. 

5483
05:18:43,103 --> 05:18:43,803
WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT THIS MAN 

5484
05:18:43,803 --> 05:18:44,437
IS GUILTY OF WHAT YOU SAID. 

5485
05:18:44,437 --> 05:18:45,071
THE QUESTION IS, DO WE KNOW 

5486
05:18:45,071 --> 05:18:45,638
ENOUGH NOW TO DELAY THIS? 

5487
05:18:45,638 --> 05:18:46,239
OR WE GOING TO RUSH TO PUT 

5488
05:18:46,239 --> 05:18:46,840
SOMEONE ON THE SUPREME COURT 

5489
05:18:46,840 --> 05:18:47,440
WITH THIS CLOUD HANGING OVER 

5490
05:18:47,440 --> 05:18:47,640
THEM? 

5491
05:18:47,640 --> 05:18:48,274
I CANNOT STOMACH THAT WE ARE 

5492
05:18:48,274 --> 05:18:48,975
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD, THAT WE 

5493
05:18:48,975 --> 05:18:49,542
ARE GOING TO SAY TO WOMEN 

5494
05:18:49,542 --> 05:18:50,210
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND TO MEN 

5495
05:18:50,210 --> 05:18:50,710
ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- 

5496
05:18:50,710 --> 05:18:51,344
>> I THINK THAT QUESTION YOU 

5497
05:18:51,344 --> 05:18:52,011
JUST ASKED IS A GOOD PLACE TO 

5498
05:18:52,011 --> 05:18:52,212
STOP. 

5499
05:18:52,212 --> 05:18:52,812
>> I WILL STOP WITH THIS. 

5500
05:18:52,812 --> 05:18:53,346
I WILL STOP WITH THIS. 

5501
05:18:53,346 --> 05:18:54,013
WITH RESPECT FOR THIS COMMITTEE 

5502
05:18:54,013 --> 05:18:54,647
AND RESPECT FOR YOU, I CANNOT 

5503
05:18:54,647 --> 05:18:55,315
SIT HERE, I CANNOT PARTICIPATE 

5504
05:18:55,315 --> 05:18:56,015
IN WHAT IS GOING TO BE A DARK 

5505
05:18:56,015 --> 05:18:56,683
MOMENT AGAIN, THE SAME WAY WE 

5506
05:18:56,683 --> 05:18:57,350
LOOK AT THE ANITA HILL TRIALS. 

5507
05:18:57,350 --> 05:18:57,884
I CANNOT PARTICIPATE. I 

5508
05:18:57,884 --> 05:18:58,585
CONCLUDE MY REMARKS, WE SHOULD 

5509
05:18:58,585 --> 05:18:59,185
NOT BRUSH ASIDE HER COMMENTS. 

5510
05:18:59,185 --> 05:18:59,786
WE SHOULD NOT BELITTLE HER 

5511
05:18:59,786 --> 05:19:00,086
TESTIMONY. 

5512
05:19:00,086 --> 05:19:00,754
WHICH LISTEN TO HER. WE SHOULD 

5513
05:19:00,754 --> 05:19:01,187
LISTEN TO WOMEN. 

5514
05:19:01,187 --> 05:19:01,654
WE SHOULD THOROUGHLY 

5515
05:19:01,654 --> 05:19:02,322
INVESTIGATE THIS BEFORE MOVING 

5516
05:19:02,322 --> 05:19:02,989
FORWARD. TO DO ANY OTHER THING 

5517
05:19:02,989 --> 05:19:03,656
IS TO DISS MINUTES -- DIMINISH 

5518
05:19:03,656 --> 05:19:04,224
THE TRUTH. AND TO AGAIN, 

5519
05:19:04,224 --> 05:19:04,858
RELEGATE OURSELVES TO WHAT I 

5520
05:19:04,858 --> 05:19:05,558
BELIEVE IS A DARK, DARK ELEMENT 

5521
05:19:05,558 --> 05:19:05,892
OF SOCIETY. 

5522
05:19:05,892 --> 05:19:06,459
WITH THAT, I WILL LEAVE. 

5523
05:19:06,459 --> 05:19:06,926
>> SENATOR KENNEDY. 

5524
05:19:06,926 --> 05:19:07,560
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5525
05:19:07,560 --> 05:19:08,194
IN MY JUDGMENT, THERE WERE NO 

5526
05:19:08,194 --> 05:19:08,895
WINNERS IN THIS ROOM YESTERDAY. 

5527
05:19:08,895 --> 05:19:09,095
NONE. 

5528
05:19:09,095 --> 05:19:09,796
ALL I SAW WERE TWO PEOPLE -- TWO

5529
05:19:09,796 --> 05:19:10,296
HUMAN BEINGS IN PAIN. 

5530
05:19:10,296 --> 05:19:10,864
ALL OF US IN MY OPINION, 

5531
05:19:10,864 --> 05:19:11,531
INCLUDING DR. FORD AND  JUDGE 

5532
05:19:11,531 --> 05:19:12,132
KAVANAUGH  HAVE A BLINKERED 

5533
05:19:12,132 --> 05:19:12,832
PERSPECTIVE. WHATEVER HAPPENED, 

5534
05:19:12,832 --> 05:19:13,366
HAPPENED 40 YEARS AGO. 

5535
05:19:13,366 --> 05:19:13,967
AND THAT IS JUST A FACT. 

5536
05:19:13,967 --> 05:19:14,634
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO 

5537
05:19:14,634 --> 05:19:14,934
DR. FORD.  

5538
05:19:14,934 --> 05:19:15,602
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL EVER 

5539
05:19:15,602 --> 05:19:16,269
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO DR. FORD. 

5540
05:19:16,269 --> 05:19:16,903
I DO BELIEVE  THAT SOMETHING 

5541
05:19:16,903 --> 05:19:17,537
VERY, VERY, VERY BAD HAPPENED 

5542
05:19:17,537 --> 05:19:17,871
TO DR. FORD. 

5543
05:19:17,871 --> 05:19:18,371
AND I'M VERY SORRY.  

5544
05:19:18,371 --> 05:19:19,105
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT JUDGE 

5545
05:19:19,105 --> 05:19:19,773
BRETT KAVANAUGH  WAS INVOLVED. 

5546
05:19:19,773 --> 05:19:20,406
AND THAT'S WHY I WILL SUPPORT 

5547
05:19:20,406 --> 05:19:20,807
HIS NOMINATION. 

5548
05:19:20,807 --> 05:19:21,441
LET ME TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

5549
05:19:21,441 --> 05:19:22,075
I'M A LITTLE MORE CERTAIN OF, 

5550
05:19:22,075 --> 05:19:22,642
AND I WILL BE BRIEF, MR. 

5551
05:19:22,642 --> 05:19:22,909
CHAIRMAN. 

5552
05:19:22,909 --> 05:19:23,543
THIS HAS BEEN, AS SOMEONE PUT 

5553
05:19:23,543 --> 05:19:24,210
IT IN AN ARTICLE THIS MORNING, 

5554
05:19:24,210 --> 05:19:24,711
A GROTESQUE CARNIVAL. 

5555
05:19:24,711 --> 05:19:25,445
IN MY OPINION, THIS HAS BEEN AN 

5556
05:19:25,445 --> 05:19:26,012
INTERGALACTIC FREAK SHOW. 

5557
05:19:26,012 --> 05:19:26,579
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, 

5558
05:19:26,579 --> 05:19:27,213
CONGRESS HAS HIT ROCK BOTTOM 

5559
05:19:27,213 --> 05:19:27,881
AND STARTED TO DIG. AND ALL OF 

5560
05:19:27,881 --> 05:19:28,548
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED, 

5561
05:19:28,548 --> 05:19:29,149
EVERY BIT OF IT. THE OTHER 

5562
05:19:29,149 --> 05:19:29,816
THING I AM CERTAIN OF IS THAT 

5563
05:19:29,816 --> 05:19:30,450
THESE GAMES, THIS CHARACTER 

5564
05:19:30,450 --> 05:19:31,117
ASSASSINATION HAS DAMAGED DR. 

5565
05:19:31,117 --> 05:19:31,785
FORD  AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH  AND 

5566
05:19:31,785 --> 05:19:32,385
THEIR FAMILIES IRREPARABLY. 

5567
05:19:32,385 --> 05:19:33,086
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. 

5568
05:19:33,086 --> 05:19:33,720
NOW, SENATOR FEINSTEIN TALKED 

5569
05:19:33,720 --> 05:19:34,354
ABOUT THIS EARLIER AND SHE IS 

5570
05:19:34,354 --> 05:19:34,587
RIGHT. 

5571
05:19:34,587 --> 05:19:35,221
HOW WE TREAT WOMEN IN AMERICA 

5572
05:19:35,221 --> 05:19:35,555
DOES MATTER. 

5573
05:19:35,555 --> 05:19:36,189
THIS IS NO COUNTRY FOR CREEPY 

5574
05:19:36,189 --> 05:19:36,890
OLD MEN. YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED 

5575
05:19:36,890 --> 05:19:37,590
MEN, -- BUT THIS IS NO COUNTRY 

5576
05:19:37,590 --> 05:19:38,258
AT ALL IN MY OPINION, NOT THE 

5577
05:19:38,258 --> 05:19:38,958
KIND OF COUNTRY I WANT TO LIVE 

5578
05:19:38,958 --> 05:19:39,626
IN WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. BOTH 

5579
05:19:39,626 --> 05:19:40,260
THE ACCUSER AND THE ACCUSED IS 

5580
05:19:40,260 --> 05:19:40,827
ENTITLED TO RESPECT, AND 

5581
05:19:40,827 --> 05:19:41,394
FAIRNESS, AND YES, TO DUE 

5582
05:19:41,394 --> 05:19:41,661
PROCESS. 

5583
05:19:41,661 --> 05:19:42,295
TO THE PERSON WHO LEAKED DR. 

5584
05:19:42,295 --> 05:19:42,962
FORD'S  LETTER, TO THE PERSON 

5585
05:19:42,962 --> 05:19:43,496
WHO BREACHED DR. FORD'S  

5586
05:19:43,496 --> 05:19:44,130
ANONYMITY, AND TO THE PERSON 

5587
05:19:44,130 --> 05:19:44,764
WHO DID NOT TELL HER SHE COULD 

5588
05:19:44,764 --> 05:19:45,465
HAVE AVOIDED THIS BY TESTIFYING 

5589
05:19:45,465 --> 05:19:46,065
PRIVATELY IN HER HOME IN 

5590
05:19:46,065 --> 05:19:46,733
CALIFORNIA, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE

5591
05:19:46,733 --> 05:19:47,433
. YOU SHOULD BOW YOUR HEAD IN 

5592
05:19:47,433 --> 05:19:48,034
SHAME IN MY OPINION AND YOU 

5593
05:19:48,034 --> 05:19:48,735
SHOULD HANG -- HIDE YOUR HEAD 

5594
05:19:48,735 --> 05:19:49,369

AND YOU ALSO OUGHT TO READ 

5597
05:19:50,603 --> 05:19:50,904
SOMETHING. 

5598
05:19:50,904 --> 05:19:51,571
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE IN 

5599
05:19:51,571 --> 05:19:52,272
GOD OR IF YOU READ THE BIBLE BUT

5600
05:19:52,272 --> 05:19:53,006
THERE IS WISDOM IN A PASSAGE IF 

5601
05:19:53,006 --> 05:19:53,640
YOU READ THE BIBLE OR BELIEVE 

5602
05:19:53,640 --> 05:19:54,040
IN GOD OR NOT. 

5603
05:19:54,040 --> 05:19:54,641
AND I WOULD REFERRED YOU TO 

5604
05:19:54,641 --> 05:19:55,341
MATTHEW 16. WHAT IS A PERSON 

5605
05:19:55,341 --> 05:19:56,042
PROFITED? FOR WHAT IS A PERSON 

5606
05:19:56,042 --> 05:19:56,743
PROFITED IF HE GAINS THE ENTIRE 

5607
05:19:56,743 --> 05:19:57,410
WORLD AND HE LOSES HIS SOUL? 

5608
05:19:57,410 --> 05:19:57,911
THANK, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5609
05:19:57,911 --> 05:19:58,578
>> THESE TOTALLY -- THE GAVEL. 

5610
05:19:58,578 --> 05:19:58,978
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5611
05:19:58,978 --> 05:19:59,546
>> YOU YIELDED YOUR TIME. 

5612
05:19:59,546 --> 05:20:00,280
>> I YIELDED PART OF MY TIME TO 

5613
05:20:00,280 --> 05:20:00,647
SENATOR BOOKER. 

5614
05:20:00,647 --> 05:20:01,047
TO HAVE ANY LEFT? 

5615
05:20:01,047 --> 05:20:01,514
>> YOU MAY PROCEED. 

5616
05:20:01,514 --> 05:20:02,248
>> I WILL YIELD MY TIME TO HIM, 

5617
05:20:02,248 --> 05:20:02,615
MR. CHAIRMAN. 

5618
05:20:02,615 --> 05:20:03,116
>> I APPRECIATE THAT 

5619
05:20:03,116 --> 05:20:03,817
GRACIOUSNESS AND I HOPE IT IS A 

5620
05:20:03,817 --> 05:20:04,384
SIGN THAT WE WILL REBUILD 

5621
05:20:04,384 --> 05:20:04,818
ACROSS THE AISLE. 

5622
05:20:04,818 --> 05:20:05,451
YESTERDAY, THERE WERE WORDS 

5623
05:20:05,451 --> 05:20:06,152
SPOKEN AND WE KNOW IN FAMILIES 

5624
05:20:06,152 --> 05:20:06,820
THAT WORDS ARE SPOKEN IN ANGER 

5625
05:20:06,820 --> 05:20:07,554
AND SOMETIMES IN THE MOMENT THAT

5626
05:20:07,554 --> 05:20:08,087
WE LATER WALKED BACK. 

5627
05:20:08,087 --> 05:20:08,688
THOSE WORDS YESTERDAY FROM 

5628
05:20:08,688 --> 05:20:09,289
MEMBERS ACROSS THE AISLE TO 

5629
05:20:09,289 --> 05:20:09,956
DECIDE -- TO THIS SIDE WERE 

5630
05:20:09,956 --> 05:20:10,323
EXTRAORDINARY. 

5631
05:20:10,323 --> 05:20:10,990
I KNOW THEY WOULD SAY SOME OF 

5632
05:20:10,990 --> 05:20:11,691
OUR WORDS TO THEM MAY BE ON THE 

5633
05:20:11,691 --> 05:20:12,025
SAME LEVEL. 

5634
05:20:12,025 --> 05:20:12,659
BUT WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER, 

5635
05:20:12,659 --> 05:20:13,293
TRAVELED TOGETHER, WE HAVE A 

5636
05:20:13,293 --> 05:20:13,927
RESPONSIBILITY TOGETHER TO DO 

5637
05:20:13,927 --> 05:20:14,527
THE BUSINESS OF THE UNITED 

5638
05:20:14,527 --> 05:20:14,894
STATES SENATE. 

5639
05:20:14,894 --> 05:20:15,528
MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU MAY NOT AGREE 

5640
05:20:15,528 --> 05:20:16,196
WITH ME BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF 

5641
05:20:16,196 --> 05:20:16,830
WORKING TOGETHER, A DELAY WOULD 

5642
05:20:16,830 --> 05:20:17,230
BE APPROPRIATE. 

5643
05:20:17,230 --> 05:20:17,931
I'M HERE TO MAKE A LAST APPEAL 

5644
05:20:17,931 --> 05:20:18,531
THAT WE AVOID THE RUSH TO 

5645
05:20:18,531 --> 05:20:19,232
JUDGMENT WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR 

5646
05:20:19,232 --> 05:20:19,833
YOUR POSITION. THE SESSION 

5647
05:20:19,833 --> 05:20:20,533
YESTERDAY WAS A JOB INTERVIEW 

5648
05:20:20,533 --> 05:20:21,201
AND IT IS A JOB INTERVIEW FOR A 

5649
05:20:21,201 --> 05:20:21,801
POSITION UNLIKE ANY OTHER. 

5650
05:20:21,801 --> 05:20:22,435
I HAVE TREMENDOUS REVERENCE FOR 

5651
05:20:22,435 --> 05:20:22,902
THE SUPREME COURT. 

5652
05:20:22,902 --> 05:20:23,603
I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER 

5653
05:20:23,603 --> 05:20:24,337
IN THE COURTS AND MY BELIEVE IS 

5654
05:20:24,337 --> 05:20:24,971
THAT THIS DECISION ON HOW TO 

5655
05:20:24,971 --> 05:20:25,638
VOTE -- AND I WILL VOTE NO, IS 

5656
05:20:25,638 --> 05:20:26,339
AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT I WILL 

5657
05:20:26,339 --> 05:20:26,906
MAKE AS A UNITED STATES 

5658
05:20:26,906 --> 05:20:27,173
SENATOR. 

5659
05:20:27,173 --> 05:20:27,807
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 

5660
05:20:27,807 --> 05:20:28,474
DESERVES NOT JUST A GOOD NOMINEE

5661
05:20:28,474 --> 05:20:29,175
BUT THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB.

5662
05:20:29,175 --> 05:20:29,909
AND THE PERSON THAT WE SAW COME 

5663
05:20:29,909 --> 05:20:30,543
BEFORE US YESTERDAY WAS FILLED 

5664
05:20:30,543 --> 05:20:31,211
WITH SUCH RANCOR AND -- SUCH 

5665
05:20:31,211 --> 05:20:31,845
ANGER, THAT I CANNOT ACCEPT 

5666
05:20:31,845 --> 05:20:32,478
THAT HE WOULD BE AN IMPARTIAL 

5667
05:20:32,478 --> 05:20:33,112
AND OBJECTIVE JUSTICE ON THE 

5668
05:20:33,112 --> 05:20:33,746
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 

5669
05:20:33,746 --> 05:20:34,347
TO DESCRIBE MEMBERS OF THIS 

5670
05:20:34,347 --> 05:20:34,914
COMMITTEE AS A LEFT-WING 

5671
05:20:34,914 --> 05:20:35,548
CONSPIRACY TO THREATEN UNITED 

5672
05:20:35,548 --> 05:20:36,115
STATES SENATORS, I SIMPLY 

5673
05:20:36,115 --> 05:20:36,482
CANNOT ACCEPT. 

5674
05:20:36,482 --> 05:20:37,150
WE ARE INTERVIEWING -- OR WE 

5675
05:20:37,150 --> 05:20:37,684
WERE INTERVIEWING JUDGE 

5676
05:20:37,684 --> 05:20:38,351
KAVANAUGH FOR  A POSITION THAT 

5677
05:20:38,351 --> 05:20:38,985
IS A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO 

5678
05:20:38,985 --> 05:20:39,619
THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 

5679
05:20:39,619 --> 05:20:40,253
HE CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT 

5680
05:20:40,253 --> 05:20:40,720
THROUGH IMPEACHMENT. 

5681
05:20:40,720 --> 05:20:41,287
AND HE WILL BE THERE FOR 

5682
05:20:41,287 --> 05:20:41,688
DECADES TO COME. 

5683
05:20:41,688 --> 05:20:42,222
I MADE NO SECRET OF MY 

5684
05:20:42,222 --> 05:20:42,856
OPPOSITION TO HIM BASED ON HIS 

5685
05:20:42,856 --> 05:20:43,523
OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM VIEWS AND 

5686
05:20:43,523 --> 05:20:44,123
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, HE IS 

5687
05:20:44,123 --> 05:20:44,824
APPARENT GOAL TO CHIP AWAY, IF 

5688
05:20:44,824 --> 05:20:45,491
NOT OVERTURN ROE V WADE AND THE 

5689
05:20:45,491 --> 05:20:46,159
GUARANTEES THAT ALLOW WOMEN TO 

5690
05:20:46,159 --> 05:20:46,860
DECIDE WHEN AND IF THEY BECOME 

5691
05:20:46,860 --> 05:20:47,527
PREGNANT AND HAVE CHILDREN, THE 

5692
05:20:47,527 --> 05:20:48,061
DECISION BY MILLIONS OF 

5693
05:20:48,061 --> 05:20:48,728
AMERICANS TO MARRY THE PERSON 

5694
05:20:48,728 --> 05:20:49,362
THEY LOVE, WORKERS RIGHTS, THE 

5695
05:20:49,362 --> 05:20:49,996
POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH I 

5696
05:20:49,996 --> 05:20:50,663
THINK WOULD BECOME AN IMPERIAL 

5697
05:20:50,663 --> 05:20:51,264
PRESIDENCY IF HE BECOMES A 

5698
05:20:51,264 --> 05:20:51,898
JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT. 

5699
05:20:51,898 --> 05:20:52,498
BUT YESTERDAY, MY OPPOSITION 

5700
05:20:52,498 --> 05:20:52,999
SOLIDIFIED BECAUSE OF 

5701
05:20:52,999 --> 05:20:53,700
TEMPERAMENT AND FITNESS WHICH I 

5702
05:20:53,700 --> 05:20:54,133
BELIEVE HE LACKS. 

5703
05:20:54,133 --> 05:20:54,834
BY VIRTUE OF THE SCREED THAT HE 

5704
05:20:54,834 --> 05:20:55,535
SAT HERE AND GAVE US HIS VIEWS 

5705
05:20:55,535 --> 05:20:56,169
STILL ARE DISQUALIFYING FOR ME 

5706
05:20:56,169 --> 05:20:56,803
BUT HIS CHARACTER AND FITNESS 

5707
05:20:56,803 --> 05:20:57,871
OUGHT TO BE A REASON FOR úEVERY 

5708
05:20:57,871 --> 05:20:58,538
WE SAW EYEWITNESS YESTERDAY OF 

5709
05:20:58,538 --> 05:20:59,205
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CHARACTER 

5710
05:20:59,205 --> 05:20:59,606
AND TEMPERAMENT. 

5711
05:20:59,606 --> 05:21:00,240
A WOMAN WHO TOLD US HER STORY 

5712
05:21:00,240 --> 05:21:00,940
IN STEADY, EVEN, HELPFUL TERMS. 

5713
05:21:00,940 --> 05:21:01,608
A STORY THAT WAS DEEPLY PAINFUL 

5714
05:21:01,608 --> 05:21:02,208
FOR HER. AND SHE HAS ENDURED 

5715
05:21:02,208 --> 05:21:02,909
THREATS AND PUBLIC ASSASSINATION

5716
05:21:02,909 --> 05:21:03,476
, CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, 

5717
05:21:03,476 --> 05:21:04,077
PUBLIC SHAMING THAT NO ONE 

5718
05:21:04,077 --> 05:21:04,577
SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER. 

5719
05:21:04,577 --> 05:21:05,211
MY HEART GOES OUT TO HER AS 

5720
05:21:05,211 --> 05:21:05,879
WELL AS TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  

5721
05:21:05,879 --> 05:21:06,346
FAMILIES -- FAMILY. 

5722
05:21:06,346 --> 05:21:07,013
THESE COMMENTS HAVE NO THREAT IN

5723
05:21:07,013 --> 05:21:07,714
-- NO PLACE IN PUBLIC COURT -- 

5724
05:21:07,714 --> 05:21:07,981
DISCORD. 

5725
05:21:07,981 --> 05:21:08,681
SHE HAS EVERY REASON TO REMAIN 

5726
05:21:08,681 --> 05:21:09,249
SILENT AND NO INCENTIVE 

5727
05:21:09,249 --> 05:21:09,849
PERSONALLY TO COME FORWARD 

5728
05:21:09,849 --> 05:21:10,516
EXCEPT TO DO A PUBLIC SERVICE 

5729
05:21:10,516 --> 05:21:11,184
FOR THE NASCENT DESIGNATION AS 

5730
05:21:11,184 --> 05:21:11,484
SHE STATED. 

5731
05:21:11,484 --> 05:21:11,985
HER STORY WAS POWERFUL, 

5732
05:21:11,985 --> 05:21:12,452
COMPELLING, PERSONAL. 

5733
05:21:12,452 --> 05:21:12,819
I BELIEVE HER. 

5734
05:21:12,819 --> 05:21:13,486
I HAVE TO DISBELIEVE AN ANGRY 

5735
05:21:13,486 --> 05:21:14,087
AND DEFIANT MEN WHOSE STORY 

5736
05:21:14,087 --> 05:21:14,721
SIMPLY DOES NOT HOLD UP. HE 

5737
05:21:14,721 --> 05:21:15,355
CLAIMED THAT THE FBI ALREADY 

5738
05:21:15,355 --> 05:21:15,989
INVESTIGATED HIM BECAUSE THEY 

5739
05:21:15,989 --> 05:21:16,556
DID A BACKGROUND CHECK SIX 

5740
05:21:16,556 --> 05:21:16,789
TIMES. 

5741
05:21:16,789 --> 05:21:17,423
THE FBI NEVER INVESTIGATED DR. 

5742
05:21:17,423 --> 05:21:17,957
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S  

5743
05:21:17,957 --> 05:21:18,291
ALLEGATIONS. 

5744
05:21:18,291 --> 05:21:18,892
IT NEVER INVESTIGATED JULIE 

5745
05:21:18,892 --> 05:21:19,425
SWETNICK'S  ALLEGATIONS. 

5746
05:21:19,425 --> 05:21:20,126
THOSE ARE GAPS IN THE WORK THAT 

5747
05:21:20,126 --> 05:21:20,560
REMAIN TO BE DONE. 

5748
05:21:20,560 --> 05:21:21,127
IN FACT, THE ABA ISSUED A 

5749
05:21:21,127 --> 05:21:21,728
STATEMENT SUPPORTING AN FBI 

5750
05:21:21,728 --> 05:21:22,262
INVESTIGATION INTO JUDGE 

5751
05:21:22,262 --> 05:21:22,829
KAVANAUGH  ACCORDING TO A 

5752
05:21:22,829 --> 05:21:23,129
COLLEAGUE. 

5753
05:21:23,129 --> 05:21:23,830
THE RATING IS THE GOLD STANDARD.

5754
05:21:23,830 --> 05:21:24,497
THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS MAY 

5755
05:21:24,497 --> 05:21:25,131
BE CONSCIENTIOUS AND DEDICATED 

5756
05:21:25,131 --> 05:21:25,665
BUT THEY ARE SIMPLY NO 

5757
05:21:25,665 --> 05:21:26,232
SUBSTITUTE FOR THE TRAINED 

5758
05:21:26,232 --> 05:21:26,733
PROFESSIONALS WITH THE 

5759
05:21:26,733 --> 05:21:27,400
EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE OF FBI 

5760
05:21:27,400 --> 05:21:28,101
AGENTS.KAVANAUGH REFUSED TO MAK 

5761
05:21:28,101 --> 05:21:28,468
THAT REQUEST. 

5762
05:21:28,468 --> 05:21:29,002
DR. BLASEY FORD DID SO. 

5763
05:21:29,002 --> 05:21:29,636
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE 

5764
05:21:29,636 --> 05:21:30,103
HIDING, WHAT IS THE 

5765
05:21:30,103 --> 05:21:30,737
ADMINISTRATION CONCEALING, WHY 

5766
05:21:30,737 --> 05:21:31,337
HAVE WE NOT RECEIVED THOSE 

5767
05:21:31,337 --> 05:21:31,971
MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS 

5768
05:21:31,971 --> 05:21:32,405
THAT REMAIN HIDDEN? 

5769
05:21:32,405 --> 05:21:32,972
WHY HAS JUDGE KAVANAUGH NOT 

5770
05:21:32,972 --> 05:21:33,406
TAKEN A POLYGRAPH? 

5771
05:21:33,406 --> 05:21:34,040
HE SAYS THEY'RE NOT RELIABLE. 

5772
05:21:34,040 --> 05:21:34,707
AND THAT THE POLYGRAPH DR. FORD 

5773
05:21:34,707 --> 05:21:35,241
SUBJECTED HERSELF TO WAS 

5774
05:21:35,241 --> 05:21:35,575
MEANINGLESS. 

5775
05:21:35,575 --> 05:21:35,942
SHE PASSED IT. 

5776
05:21:35,942 --> 05:21:36,643
AS A JUDGE ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT, 

5777
05:21:36,643 --> 05:21:37,310
JUDGE KAVANAUGH RULED THAT THEY 

5778
05:21:37,310 --> 05:21:37,844
ARE IN FACT MEANINGFUL. 

5779
05:21:37,844 --> 05:21:38,311
HE WROTE, QUOTE, LAW 

5780
05:21:38,311 --> 05:21:38,845
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USE 

5781
05:21:38,845 --> 05:21:39,379
POLYGRAPHS TO TEST THE 

5782
05:21:39,379 --> 05:21:39,979
CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES AND 

5783
05:21:39,979 --> 05:21:40,613
CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS, REFUSING 

5784
05:21:40,613 --> 05:21:41,147
TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH JUDGE 

5785
05:21:41,147 --> 05:21:41,814
KAVANAUGH HAS FAILED THAT TEST. 

5786
05:21:41,814 --> 05:21:42,415
JUDGE KAVANAUGH CLAIMED THAT 

5787
05:21:42,415 --> 05:21:43,082
ALL FOUR WITNESSES, DR. BLASEY 

5788
05:21:43,082 --> 05:21:43,650

5789
05:21:43,650 --> 05:21:44,317
PRESENT AT THE PARTY HAVE SAID 

5790
05:21:44,317 --> 05:21:45,018
THAT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT, QUOTE, 

5791
05:21:45,018 --> 05:21:45,385
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 

5792
05:21:45,385 --> 05:21:46,019
ONLY ONE PERSON HAS SAID THE 

5793
05:21:46,019 --> 05:21:46,653
SEXUAL ASSAULT DIDN'T HAPPEN, 

5794
05:21:46,653 --> 05:21:47,053
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

5795
05:21:47,053 --> 05:21:47,754
DR. BLASEY FORD IDENTIFIED SAID 

5796
05:21:47,754 --> 05:21:48,321
THEY DO NOT REMEMBER THE 

5797
05:21:48,321 --> 05:21:48,588
INCIDENT. 

5798
05:21:48,588 --> 05:21:49,155
THAT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. 

5799
05:21:49,155 --> 05:21:49,789
DO NOT RECALL IS A DIFFERENT 

5800
05:21:49,789 --> 05:21:50,356
STATEMENT THAN IT DIDN'T 

5801
05:21:50,356 --> 05:21:50,590
HAPPEN. 

5802
05:21:50,590 --> 05:21:51,157
AND THE OTHER WOMAN DOCTOR 

5803
05:21:51,157 --> 05:21:51,824
BLASEY FORD NAMED WHO WAS THERE 

5804
05:21:51,824 --> 05:21:52,492
HAS SINCE PUBLICLY STATED THAT 

5805
05:21:52,492 --> 05:21:53,159
SHE BELIEVES DR. BLASEY FORD'S 

5806
05:21:53,159 --> 05:21:53,426
ACCOUNT. 

5807
05:21:53,426 --> 05:21:54,060
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TRIED TO GIVE 

5808
05:21:54,060 --> 05:21:54,694
HIMSELF AN ALIBI, MAKING IT 

5809
05:21:54,694 --> 05:21:55,361
SOUND LIKE HE DIDN'T DRINK ON 

5810
05:21:55,361 --> 05:21:55,662
WEEKNIGHTS. 

5811
05:21:55,662 --> 05:21:56,296
HIS OWN HIGH SCHOOL CALENDAR 

5812
05:21:56,296 --> 05:21:56,963
WHICH HE PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE 

5813
05:21:56,963 --> 05:21:57,563
AS EVIDENCE CONTRADICTS THAT 

5814
05:21:57,563 --> 05:21:57,864
STATEMENT. 

5815
05:21:57,864 --> 05:21:58,431
DURING THE HEARING AND AN 

5816
05:21:58,431 --> 05:21:58,998

SENATOR BOOKER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

5818
05:21:59,632 --> 05:22:00,199
ADMITTED THAT ONE OF THE 

5819
05:22:00,199 --> 05:22:00,867
ENTRIES ON HIS CALENDAR FROM A 

5820
05:22:00,867 --> 05:22:01,567
THURSDAY SIGNIFIED THAT HE WENT 

5821
05:22:01,567 --> 05:22:02,235
TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE TO DRINK. 

5822
05:22:02,235 --> 05:22:02,869
HE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT HE 

5823
05:22:02,869 --> 05:22:03,569
NEVER IN HIS LIFE DRANK SO MUCH 

5824
05:22:03,569 --> 05:22:04,137
THAT HE COULDN'T REMEMBER. 

5825
05:22:04,137 --> 05:22:04,671
NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO SPENT 

5826
05:22:04,671 --> 05:22:05,271
CONSIDERABLE TIME WITH HIM 

5827
05:22:05,271 --> 05:22:05,872
DURING THE HEARING IN HIGH 

5828
05:22:05,872 --> 05:22:06,539
SCHOOL, DURING HIS HIGH SCHOOL, 

5829
05:22:06,539 --> 05:22:07,140
COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL YEARS 

5830
05:22:07,140 --> 05:22:07,774
CONFIRMED THAT HE FREQUENTLY 

5831
05:22:07,774 --> 05:22:08,408
DRANK TO EXCESS AND SOMETIMES 

5832
05:22:08,408 --> 05:22:08,875
BECAME BELLIGERENT. 

5833
05:22:08,875 --> 05:22:09,409
FINALLY, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

5834
05:22:09,409 --> 05:22:10,009
CLAIMED THAT HE HAS ALWAYS 

5835
05:22:10,009 --> 05:22:10,643
TREATED WOMEN WITH DIGNITY AND 

5836
05:22:10,643 --> 05:22:11,277
RESPECT, HIS WORDS, YET HE AND 

5837
05:22:11,277 --> 05:22:11,911
HIS HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS NAMED 

5838
05:22:11,911 --> 05:22:12,578
ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS RONATTA 

5839
05:22:12,578 --> 05:22:13,246
DAUPHIN IN THEIR YEARBOOK PAGE 

5840
05:22:13,246 --> 05:22:13,913
SAYING THEY WERE HER ALUM NEWS, 

5841
05:22:13,913 --> 05:22:14,480
REDUCING HER TO A SEXUAL 

5842
05:22:14,480 --> 05:22:14,747
CONQUEST. 

5843
05:22:14,747 --> 05:22:15,381
THAT IS NO WAY TO TREAT WOMEN 

5844
05:22:15,381 --> 05:22:15,949
WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. 

5845
05:22:15,949 --> 05:22:16,582
IN FACT, SHE ATTESTED TO THE 

5846
05:22:16,582 --> 05:22:17,216
PAIN THAT IT HAS CAUSED HER. 

5847
05:22:17,216 --> 05:22:17,884
HE WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT 

5848
05:22:17,884 --> 05:22:18,518
THESE BRAVE COURAGEOUS SEXUAL 

5849
05:22:18,518 --> 05:22:19,118
ASSAULT SURVIVORS HAVE COME 

5850
05:22:19,118 --> 05:22:19,819
FORWARD AS PART OF A VAST RIGHT 

5851
05:22:19,819 --> 05:22:20,219
WING CONSPIRACY. 

5852
05:22:20,219 --> 05:22:20,853
HOW INSULTING TO THEM TO SAY 

5853
05:22:20,853 --> 05:22:21,487
THAT THEY ARE PAWNS OR PUPPETS 

5854
05:22:21,487 --> 05:22:22,021
OF US OR ANYONE ELSE. 

5855
05:22:22,021 --> 05:22:22,555
IN FACT, THEY ARE BRAVE 

5856
05:22:22,555 --> 05:22:23,156
COURAGEOUS INDEPENDENT WOMEN 

5857
05:22:23,156 --> 05:22:23,723
WHO HAVE STEPPED FORWARD. 

5858
05:22:23,723 --> 05:22:24,424
SO I WANT TO SAY IN CONCLUSION 

5859
05:22:24,424 --> 05:22:25,091
TO THE MEN OF AMERICA, FOR YOU 

5860
05:22:25,091 --> 05:22:25,792
I HOPE THIS WILL BE A TEACHING 

5861
05:22:25,792 --> 05:22:26,359
MOMENT NOT TOO DENTIGRATE 

5862
05:22:26,359 --> 05:22:27,026
ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN A SURVIVOR 

5863
05:22:27,026 --> 05:22:27,694
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT TO LIFT 

5864
05:22:27,694 --> 05:22:27,961
THEM UP. 

5865
05:22:27,961 --> 05:22:28,661
I WANT TO ENTER INTO THE RECORD 

5866
05:22:28,661 --> 05:22:29,262

5867
05:22:29,262 --> 05:22:29,829

5886
05:22:38,938 --> 05:22:39,539
SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS 

5887
05:22:39,539 --> 05:22:40,106
SOMEONE WHO STEPPED FORWARD 

5888
05:22:40,106 --> 05:22:40,773
TRULY TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER.

ACTUAL FINAL CONFIRMATION VOTE 

5954
05:23:17,744 --> 05:23:18,244
WOULD OCCUR ON TUESDAY. 

5955
05:23:18,244 --> 05:23:18,911
A FEW THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND. 

5956
05:23:18,911 --> 05:23:19,612
IF FOR SOME REASON HERE IN THE 

5957
05:23:19,612 --> 05:23:20,246
NEXT FEW MINUTES IT ENDS UP 

5958
05:23:20,246 --> 05:23:20,880
BEING THAT A MINORITY OF THE 

5959
05:23:20,880 --> 05:23:21,447
COMMITTEE MEMBERS VOTE FOR 

5960
05:23:21,447 --> 05:23:21,981
KAVANAUGH INSTEAD OF THE 

5961
05:23:21,981 --> 05:23:22,515
MAJORITY, IT STILL GETS 

5962
05:23:22,515 --> 05:23:23,116
REFERRED TO THE FULL SENATE, 

5963
05:23:23,116 --> 05:23:23,683
AND IT'S UP TO THE SENATE 

5964
05:23:23,683 --> 05:23:24,350
LEADER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT 

5965
05:23:24,350 --> 05:23:24,984
TO HOLD THAT VOTE AND STILL 

5966
05:23:24,984 --> 05:23:25,518
CONSIDER THE NOMINATION. 

5967
05:23:25,518 --> 05:23:26,119
IT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST. 

5968
05:23:26,119 --> 05:23:26,753
IT'LL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, AND 

5969
05:23:26,753 --> 05:23:27,387
MITCH McCONNELL HAS SAID THAT 

5970
05:23:27,387 --> 05:23:28,054
WIN OR LOSE IN THE COMMITTEE, 

5971
05:23:28,054 --> 05:23:28,755
HE'S BRINGING THE NOMINATION TO 

5972
05:23:28,755 --> 05:23:29,288
THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. 

5973
05:23:29,288 --> 05:23:29,856
WE'RE STILL AT THIS POINT 

5974
05:23:29,856 --> 05:23:30,556
WAITING ON THE FATE OF ABOUT WE 

5975
05:23:30,556 --> 05:23:31,257
THINK ONLY FOUR SENATORS ACROSS 

5976
05:23:31,257 --> 05:23:31,724
THE 100-MEMBER BODY. 

5977
05:23:31,724 --> 05:23:32,325
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE, THE 

5978
05:23:32,325 --> 05:23:32,925

HEIDI HEITKAMP DEMOCRAT OF

NORTH DAKOTA. 

5983
05:23:34,994 --> 05:23:35,628
AT THIS POINT THEY'RE REALLY 

5984
05:23:35,628 --> 05:23:36,295
THE ONLY FOUR WHO HAVEN'T SAID 

5985
05:23:36,295 --> 05:23:36,796
WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO. 

5986
05:23:36,796 --> 05:23:37,397
WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE STILL 

5987
05:23:37,397 --> 05:23:37,964
MULLING THAT DECISION AND 

5988
05:23:37,964 --> 05:23:38,564
BASICALLY THEY'VE GOTTA SHOW 

5989
05:23:38,564 --> 05:23:39,232
THEIR CARDS BY SATURDAY MORNING 

5990
05:23:39,232 --> 05:23:39,899
WHEN THAT FIRST PROCEDURAL VOTE 

5991
05:23:39,899 --> 05:23:40,166
HAPPENS. 

5992
05:23:40,166 --> 05:23:40,666
AND AT THAT POINT IT 

5993
05:23:40,666 --> 05:23:41,334
ESSENTIALLY GIVE US A SENSE OF 

5994
05:23:41,334 --> 05:23:41,901
HOW THE VOTE WOULD GO ON 

5995
05:23:41,901 --> 05:23:42,535
TUESDAY AND WE START TO LOSE 

5996
05:23:42,535 --> 05:23:43,102
SOME OF THE DRAMA AND THE 

5997
05:23:43,102 --> 05:23:43,703
UNCERTAINTY AROUND ALL THIS. 

5998
05:23:43,703 --> 05:23:44,337
SO IT'S THE NEXT FEW MINUTES 

5999
05:23:44,337 --> 05:23:45,038
HERE WHERE WE NOW ANTICIPATE IT 

6000
05:23:45,038 --> 05:23:45,705
WILL BE AN 11-10 VOTE WHERE -- 

6001
05:23:45,705 --> 05:23:46,272
AND THAT ESSENTIALLY THEN 

6002
05:23:46,272 --> 05:23:46,906
BEGINS THE FORMAL PROCESS OF 

6003
05:23:46,906 --> 05:23:47,573
TAKING IT TO THE FULL SENATE. 

6004
05:23:47,573 --> 05:23:48,141
>> AND, ED, I HEARD SENATOR 

6005
05:23:48,141 --> 05:23:48,841
McCONNELL SAY THAT EVEN IF THEY 

6006
05:23:48,841 --> 05:23:49,375
DON'T VOTE THIS OUT OF 

6007
05:23:49,375 --> 05:23:50,009
COMMITTEE IN JUDICIARY, HE'S 

6008
05:23:50,009 --> 05:23:50,610
STILL GOING TO TAKE IT UP IN 

6009
05:23:50,610 --> 05:23:51,310
THE SENATE, IS THAT -- IS WHAT 

6010
05:23:51,310 --> 05:23:51,911
I'M HEARING ACCURATE, AND CAN 

6011
05:23:51,911 --> 05:23:52,245
HE DO THAT? 

6012
05:23:52,245 --> 05:23:52,678
>>REPORTER:  YES. 

6013
05:23:52,678 --> 05:23:52,879
YES. 

6014
05:23:52,879 --> 05:23:53,479
AS SENATE LEADER HE HAS THE 

6015
05:23:53,479 --> 05:23:53,946
ABILITY TO DO THAT. 

6016
05:23:53,946 --> 05:23:54,614
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO OVERRIDE 

6017
05:23:54,614 --> 05:23:55,248
COMMITTEES AND BRING ANYTHING 

6018
05:23:55,248 --> 05:23:55,782
HE WANTS TO THE FLOOR. 

6019
05:23:55,782 --> 05:23:56,382
THAT'S THE AWESOME OF POWER 

6020
05:23:56,382 --> 05:23:57,050
THAT WHOEVER IS SENATE LEADER 

6021
05:23:57,050 --> 05:23:57,250
HAS. 

6022
05:23:57,250 --> 05:23:57,917
IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS 

6023
05:23:57,917 --> 05:23:58,584
OF THE SENATE IN RECENT YEARS 

6024
05:23:58,584 --> 05:23:59,252
UNDER DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN 

6025
05:23:59,252 --> 05:23:59,852
CONTROL THAT THE LEADERS CAN 

6026
05:23:59,852 --> 05:24:00,553
BASICALLY DO WHATEVER THEY WANT 

6027
05:24:00,553 --> 05:24:01,220
AND BYPASS THE COMMITTEES WHICH 

6028
05:24:01,220 --> 05:24:01,854
TRADITIONALLY HAVE HELD MUCH 

6029
05:24:01,854 --> 05:24:02,422
MORE POWER IN ULTIMATELY 

6030
05:24:02,422 --> 05:24:03,056
DECIDING WHAT GETS DECIDED BY 

6031
05:24:03,056 --> 05:24:03,456
THE FULL SENATE. 

6032
05:24:03,456 --> 05:24:04,090
>> YOU'RE SO RIGHT, ED, ABOUT 

6033
05:24:04,090 --> 05:24:04,490
THESE PROCEDURES. 

6034
05:24:04,490 --> 05:24:05,091
IT GIVES US A WINDOW INTO 

6035
05:24:05,091 --> 05:24:05,658
EXACTLY HOW CONGRESS RUNS. 

6036
05:24:05,658 --> 05:24:06,292
WE SEE HERE SUSAN COLLINS AND 

6037
05:24:06,292 --> 05:24:06,859
SENATOR MURKOWSKI, EXACTLY 

6038
05:24:06,859 --> 05:24:07,427
WAITING TO SEE WHAT THESE 

6039
05:24:07,427 --> 05:24:08,027
POTENTIAL SWING VOTERS, WHERE 

6040
05:24:08,027 --> 05:24:08,428
THEY MIGHT TURN. 

6041
05:24:08,428 --> 05:24:08,995
ED, I WANT TO THANK YOU.

05:24:08,995 --> 05:24:09,529

>>>  I WANT TO BRING IN NOW CBS

05:24:11,297 --> 05:24:11,798
NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 

6047
05:24:11,798 --> 05:24:12,398
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG. 

6048
05:24:12,398 --> 05:24:13,032
WEIJIA, WHAT'S BEEN ABOUT THE 

6049
05:24:13,032 --> 05:24:13,666
IMPENDING VOTE ON KAVANAUGH? 

6050
05:24:13,666 --> 05:24:14,333
>>REPORTER:  WE DID HEAR FROM 

6051
05:24:14,333 --> 05:24:15,001
THE OFFICIAL SPOKESPERSON FROM 

6052
05:24:15,001 --> 05:24:15,601
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO HAS BEEN 

6053
05:24:15,601 --> 05:24:16,235
TALKING TO REPORTERS FROM THE 

6054
05:24:16,235 --> 05:24:16,803
VERY BEGINNING ABOUT THIS 

6055
05:24:16,803 --> 05:24:17,437
CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND THAT 

6056
05:24:17,437 --> 05:24:17,804
IS RAJ  SHAH. 

6057
05:24:17,804 --> 05:24:18,404
HE SPOKE THIS MORNING RIGHT 

6058
05:24:18,404 --> 05:24:19,038
HERE ON THE NORTH LAWN OF THE 

6059
05:24:19,038 --> 05:24:19,372
WHITE HOUSE. 

6060
05:24:19,372 --> 05:24:19,906
AND HE SAID HE'S VERY 

6061
05:24:19,906 --> 05:24:20,206
CONFIDENT. 

6062
05:24:20,206 --> 05:24:20,740
HE HASN'T BEEN GIVEN ANY 

6063
05:24:20,740 --> 05:24:21,240
ASSURANCES FROM ALL THE 

6064
05:24:21,240 --> 05:24:21,908
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE A VOTE IN 

6065
05:24:21,908 --> 05:24:22,508
THIS, BUT HE BELIEVES THAT 

6066
05:24:22,508 --> 05:24:23,109
ULTIMATELY KAVANAUGH WILL BE 

6067
05:24:23,109 --> 05:24:23,409
CONFIRMED. 

6068
05:24:23,409 --> 05:24:24,010
SO THE MOOD HERE IS VERY 

6069
05:24:24,010 --> 05:24:24,243
UPBEAT. 

6070
05:24:24,243 --> 05:24:24,744
OFFICIALS I THINK WERE 

6071
05:24:24,744 --> 05:24:25,411
BREATHING A COLLECTIVE SIGH OF 

6072
05:24:25,411 --> 05:24:26,112
RELIEF AFTER THEY WERE ABLE TO 

6073
05:24:26,112 --> 05:24:26,679
HEAR KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY 

6074
05:24:26,679 --> 05:24:27,246
BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE POINT 

6075
05:24:27,246 --> 05:24:27,914
THAT I THINK THEY WERE SHAKEN 

6076
05:24:27,914 --> 05:24:28,514
AFTER JUST HEARING FROM DR. 

6077
05:24:28,514 --> 05:24:28,714
FORD. 

6078
05:24:28,714 --> 05:24:29,315
OFFICIALS SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, 

6079
05:24:29,315 --> 05:24:29,982
STAFFERS WERE WORRIED, FRANKLY, 

6080
05:24:29,982 --> 05:24:30,616
BECAUSE HER TESTIMONY WAS ALSO 

6081
05:24:30,616 --> 05:24:31,284
SO POWERFUL AND COMPELLING AND 

6082
05:24:31,284 --> 05:24:31,884
THEY WERE NOT SURE WHAT THEY 

6083
05:24:31,884 --> 05:24:32,518
WOULD GET FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

6084
05:24:32,518 --> 05:24:33,152
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME WE SAW 

6085
05:24:33,152 --> 05:24:33,719
HIM ANSWERING QUESTIONS WAS 

6086
05:24:33,719 --> 05:24:34,420
DURING A NEWS INTERVIEW, AND IT 

6087
05:24:34,420 --> 05:24:35,088
WAS A VERY DIFFERENT KAVANAUGH. 

6088
05:24:35,088 --> 05:24:35,755
HE WAS SUBDUED, HE WAS ALMOST 

6089
05:24:35,755 --> 05:24:36,322
ROBOTIC, AND HE RECEIVED 

6090
05:24:36,322 --> 05:24:36,923
CRITICISM FROM THAT OFFICIALS 

6091
05:24:36,923 --> 05:24:37,457
SAY FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 

6092
05:24:37,457 --> 05:24:38,157
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT 

6093
05:24:38,157 --> 05:24:38,624
THE PRESIDENT VALUES 

6094
05:24:38,624 --> 05:24:39,225
PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN 

6095
05:24:39,225 --> 05:24:39,859
CAMERAS ARE ROLLING AND I THINK 

6096
05:24:39,859 --> 05:24:40,526
THAT HE BELIEVES THAT KAVANAUGH 

6097
05:24:40,526 --> 05:24:41,127
IN THAT INTERVIEW COULD HAVE 

6098
05:24:41,127 --> 05:24:41,761
DONE BETTER AND HE CERTAINLY 

6099
05:24:41,761 --> 05:24:42,395
DELIVERED YESTERDAY BEFORE THE 

6100
05:24:42,395 --> 05:24:42,995
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

6101
05:24:42,995 --> 05:24:43,496
SO I THINK THERE'S AN 

6102
05:24:43,496 --> 05:24:44,097
OVERWHELMING SENSE OF RELIEF 

6103
05:24:44,097 --> 05:24:44,797
AND OPTIMISM HERE AS THEY WAIT 

6104
05:24:44,797 --> 05:24:45,331
FOR THESE VOTES TO COME 

6105
05:24:45,331 --> 05:24:45,598
THROUGH. 

6106
05:24:45,598 --> 05:24:45,965
>> ALL RIGHT.

6108
05:24:46,299 --> 05:24:46,966

05:24:58,644 --> 05:24:59,178
KAVANAUGH I THINK REALLY 

6131
05:24:59,178 --> 05:24:59,812
CHANGED THE GAME IN TERMS OF 

6132
05:24:59,812 --> 05:25:00,480
OUR EXPECT ALLEGATIONS FOR THIS 

6133
05:25:00,480 --> 05:25:01,047
[ NO AUDIO  ] REALLY NOT 

6134
05:25:01,047 --> 05:25:01,747
EXPLAINING WHERE HE WAS ON THIS 

6135
05:25:01,747 --> 05:25:01,948
VOTE. 

6136
05:25:01,948 --> 05:25:02,548
YESTERDAY PUTTING, YOU KNOW, 

6137
05:25:02,548 --> 05:25:03,116
SAYING, YOU KNOW, KIND OF 

6138
05:25:03,116 --> 05:25:03,749
LAMENTING THE WHOLE PROCESS AND 

6139
05:25:03,749 --> 05:25:04,383
ALSO RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT, 

6140
05:25:04,383 --> 05:25:05,017
YOU KNOW, BELIEVABILITY AND WHO 

6141
05:25:05,017 --> 05:25:05,585
COMES -- WHO TO BELIEVE. 

6142
05:25:05,585 --> 05:25:06,285
HE WASN'T QUITE SURE HE HAD THE 

6143
05:25:06,285 --> 05:25:06,552
ANSWERS. 

6144
05:25:06,552 --> 05:25:07,253
MORNING HE KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGED 

6145
05:25:07,253 --> 05:25:07,453
THAT. 

6146
05:25:07,453 --> 05:25:08,121
SO SAYING THAT THERE'S AS MUCH 

6147
05:25:08,121 --> 05:25:08,688
DOUBT AS CERTAINTY AS IT 

6148
05:25:08,688 --> 05:25:09,188
PERTAINS TO KAVANAUGH. 

6149
05:25:09,188 --> 05:25:09,789
SO IN FACT IF THE COMMITTEE 

6150
05:25:09,789 --> 05:25:10,456
DOES VOTE AS WE'RE EXPECTING AT 

6151
05:25:10,456 --> 05:25:11,124
2:00 TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH, THAT 

6152
05:25:11,124 --> 05:25:11,724
CERTAINLY GIVES HIM MOMENTUM, 

6153
05:25:11,724 --> 05:25:12,291
AND REPUBLICANS ARE ALREADY 

6154
05:25:12,291 --> 05:25:12,792
FEELING MOMENTUM AFTER 

6155
05:25:12,792 --> 05:25:13,092
YESTERDAY. 

6156
05:25:13,092 --> 05:25:13,659
THE KEY IS THE TIMING AND 

6157
05:25:13,659 --> 05:25:14,293
GETTING THIS DONE QUICKLY SO 

6158
05:25:14,293 --> 05:25:14,961
THAT THERE ISN'T ROOM FOR MORE 

6159
05:25:14,961 --> 05:25:15,661
POLLING, MORE REACTION FROM THE 

6160
05:25:15,661 --> 05:25:15,895
PUBLIC. 

6161
05:25:15,895 --> 05:25:16,496
THERE ARE THINGS THAT COULD 

6162
05:25:16,496 --> 05:25:16,896
INFLUENCE VOTES. 

6163
05:25:16,896 --> 05:25:17,497
>> NIALL, CAITLIN WAS TALKING 

6164
05:25:17,497 --> 05:25:18,131
ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN MOMENTUM, 

6165
05:25:18,131 --> 05:25:18,798
BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO 

6166
05:25:18,798 --> 05:25:19,432
CREATE THEIR OWN MOMENTUM LED 

6167
05:25:19,432 --> 05:25:19,866
BY KAMALA HARRIS. 

6168
05:25:19,866 --> 05:25:20,500
DO WE KNOW THOSE MODERATE RED 

6169
05:25:20,500 --> 05:25:21,134
STATE DEMOCRAT, DO WE KNOW HOW 

6170
05:25:21,134 --> 05:25:21,767
THEY'RE VOTING AT THIS POINT? 

6171
05:25:21,767 --> 05:25:22,468
>> WE DO IN A COUPLE OF CASES. 

6172
05:25:22,468 --> 05:25:23,169
AND THIS ACTUALLY BUILDS ON THE 

6173
05:25:23,169 --> 05:25:23,803
POINT THAT CAITLIN WAS MAKING 

6174
05:25:23,803 --> 05:25:24,337
ABOUT REPUBLICANS ON THE 

6175
05:25:24,337 --> 05:25:24,971
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE'RE SEEING 

6176
05:25:24,971 --> 05:25:25,571
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN 

6177
05:25:25,571 --> 05:25:26,172
EXPECTED TO BUCK THE PARTY 

6178
05:25:26,172 --> 05:25:26,606
LINE, NOT DOING SO. 

6179
05:25:26,606 --> 05:25:27,140
JOE DONNELLY IN INDIANA 

6180
05:25:27,140 --> 05:25:27,807
PARTICULARLY IS A PRIME EXAMPLE 

6181
05:25:27,807 --> 05:25:28,074
OF THAT. 

6182
05:25:28,074 --> 05:25:28,674
HE'S GOING TO VOTE AGAINST 

6183
05:25:28,674 --> 05:25:28,975
KAVANAUGH. 

6184
05:25:28,975 --> 05:25:29,475
I WAS SPEAKING WITH A 

6185
05:25:29,475 --> 05:25:30,076
REPUBLICAN SOURCE LAST NIGHT 

6186
05:25:30,076 --> 05:25:30,576
HOFF HAVING HEARD JUDGE 

6187
05:25:30,576 --> 05:25:31,210
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY BELIEVED 

6188
05:25:31,210 --> 05:25:31,844
A COUPLE OF RED STATE DEMOCRATS 

6189
05:25:31,844 --> 05:25:32,411
COULD BE FLIPPED ONTO THE 

6190
05:25:32,411 --> 05:25:32,812
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 

6191
05:25:32,812 --> 05:25:33,346
THAT SOURCE WAS CLEARLY 

6192
05:25:33,346 --> 05:25:34,013
IMPLYING THAT DONNELLY COULD BE 

6193
05:25:34,013 --> 05:25:34,347
ONE OF THEM. 

6194
05:25:34,347 --> 05:25:34,847
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE. 

6195
05:25:34,847 --> 05:25:35,448
SO I THINK THAT SHOWS THAT 

6196
05:25:35,448 --> 05:25:36,115
WE'RE REALLY GOING BACK TO MORE 

6197
05:25:36,115 --> 05:25:36,749
PREDICTABLE LINES FOR THE MOST 

6198
05:25:36,749 --> 05:25:37,383
PART, EVEN THOUGH WE DO HAVE 

6199
05:25:37,383 --> 05:25:38,050
THE FOUR SENATORS, TWO ON EACH 

6200
05:25:38,050 --> 05:25:38,651
SIDE WHO ED MENTIONED, AND 

6201
05:25:38,651 --> 05:25:39,285
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ATTENTION 

6202
05:25:39,285 --> 05:25:39,986
IS GOING TO GO WHEN IT COMES TO 

6203
05:25:39,986 --> 05:25:40,453
A FULL SENATE VOTE. 

6204
05:25:40,453 --> 05:25:41,120
>> LESLIE, WHAT DO REPUBLICANS 

6205
05:25:41,120 --> 05:25:41,787
HAVE TO GAIN AT THIS POINT BY 

6206
05:25:41,787 --> 05:25:42,355
GETTING THIS THROUGH RIGHT 

6207
05:25:42,355 --> 05:25:42,555
AWAY? 

6208
05:25:42,555 --> 05:25:42,822
>> SURE. 

6209
05:25:42,822 --> 05:25:43,356
IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT 

6210
05:25:43,356 --> 05:25:43,890
CAMPAIGN PROMISE FOR THE 

6211
05:25:43,890 --> 05:25:44,524
PRESIDENT, AND YOU HAVE MANY 

6212
05:25:44,524 --> 05:25:45,124
FOLKS ESPECIALLY IN THE RED 

6213
05:25:45,124 --> 05:25:45,791
STATES WHO FEEL THAT THIS IS 

6214
05:25:45,791 --> 05:25:46,425
REALLY THE NOMINEE, THE RIGHT 

6215
05:25:46,425 --> 05:25:47,059
NOMINEE FOR THE SUPREME COURT, 

6216
05:25:47,059 --> 05:25:47,760
AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT ELSE IS 

6217
05:25:47,760 --> 05:25:48,394
SAID, LIKE SHE SAID, HE SAID, 

6218
05:25:48,394 --> 05:25:49,028
THAT THEY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT 

6219
05:25:49,028 --> 05:25:49,529
HE'S THE RIGHT CHOICE. 

6220
05:25:49,529 --> 05:25:50,196
AND THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS THAT 

6221
05:25:50,196 --> 05:25:50,696
HAVE THIS CONFLICT OF 

6222
05:25:50,696 --> 05:25:51,297
CONSCIENCES, YOU KNOW, THAT 

6223
05:25:51,297 --> 05:25:51,964
THEY DO FEEL THAT DR. FORD WAS 

6224
05:25:51,964 --> 05:25:52,598
VERY SYMPATHIZING CANDIDATE, 

6225
05:25:52,598 --> 05:25:53,232
VERY TRUTHFUL, AND THAT THERE 

6226
05:25:53,232 --> 05:25:53,900
IS SOMETHING THERE, BUT THEY'RE 

6227
05:25:53,900 --> 05:25:54,500
NOT WILLING TO GIVE A LOT OF 

6228
05:25:54,500 --> 05:25:55,134
DAYLIGHT BECAUSE THEY REALIZE 

6229
05:25:55,134 --> 05:25:55,768
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THIS DONE, 

6230
05:25:55,768 --> 05:25:56,335
THERE'S MOMENTUM BEHIND THE 

6231
05:25:56,335 --> 05:25:57,003
CANDIDATE AND THEY REALLY HAVE 

6232
05:25:57,003 --> 05:25:57,470
TO PUSH IT THROUGH. 

6233
05:25:57,470 --> 05:25:58,104
I JUST WONDER THE CONSEQUENCE 

6234
05:25:58,104 --> 05:25:58,538
AFTER THE MIDTERMS. 

6235
05:25:58,538 --> 05:25:59,005
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 

6236
05:25:59,005 --> 05:25:59,705
IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR 

6237
05:25:59,705 --> 05:26:00,206
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT? 

6238
05:26:00,206 --> 05:26:00,873
>> PARTICULARLY I THINK WOMEN. 

6239
05:26:00,873 --> 05:26:01,507
THERE'S NOT AN EASY SOLUTION. 

6240
05:26:01,507 --> 05:26:02,108
THERE'S A LOT OF LAYERS TO 

6241
05:26:02,108 --> 05:26:02,308
THIS. 

6242
05:26:02,308 --> 05:26:02,842
WHILE I SEE A LOT OF MY 

6243
05:26:02,842 --> 05:26:03,442
COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY IN RED 

6244
05:26:03,442 --> 05:26:03,976
STATES, THEY FEEL THAT 

6245
05:26:03,976 --> 05:26:04,577
SOMETHING DID HAPPEN TO DR. 

6246
05:26:04,577 --> 05:26:05,077
FORD BUT IT'S MISTAKEN 

6247
05:26:05,077 --> 05:26:05,344
IDENTITY. 

6248
05:26:05,344 --> 05:26:06,012
I THINK IT'S JUST THIS WAY OF 

6249
05:26:06,012 --> 05:26:06,646
RECONCILING A VERY DIFFICULT, 

6250
05:26:06,646 --> 05:26:07,246
TRAUMATIC SITUATION IN A WAY 

6251
05:26:07,246 --> 05:26:07,880
THAT'S DIGESTIBLE, BUT I DON'T 

6252
05:26:07,880 --> 05:26:08,347
THINK IT'S THAT EASY. 

6253
05:26:08,347 --> 05:26:08,981
AND DOI THINK THE CONVERSATION 

6254
05:26:08,981 --> 05:26:09,649
IS GOING -- AND I DO THINK THE 

6255
05:26:09,649 --> 05:26:10,183
CONVERSATION IS GOING TO 

6256
05:26:10,183 --> 05:26:10,816
CONTINUE, THE LEGITIMACY OF A 

6257
05:26:10,816 --> 05:26:11,384
PARTISAN NOOM KNEE, THAT'S 

6258
05:26:11,384 --> 05:26:11,984
GOING TO CONTINUE AS WELL. 

6259
05:26:11,984 --> 05:26:12,585
>> I THINK CAITLIN WHO SAID 

6260
05:26:12,585 --> 05:26:13,186
THIS WAS A CAMPAIGN PROMISE 

6261
05:26:13,186 --> 05:26:13,819
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE ABOUT 

6262
05:26:13,819 --> 05:26:14,253
THE SUPREME COURT. 

6263
05:26:14,253 --> 05:26:14,887
HE'S TRYING TO FULFILL THESE 

6264
05:26:14,887 --> 05:26:15,154
PROMISES. 

6265
05:26:15,154 --> 05:26:15,721
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS -- 

6266
05:26:15,721 --> 05:26:16,355
WHETHER KAVANAUGH GETS THROUGH 

6267
05:26:16,355 --> 05:26:16,956
OR NOT, HOW IS IT GOING TO 

6268
05:26:16,956 --> 05:26:17,290
AFFECT 2020? 

6269
05:26:17,290 --> 05:26:17,957
>> WELL, THIS IS INTERESTING. 

6270
05:26:17,957 --> 05:26:18,558
SO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE 

6271
05:26:18,558 --> 05:26:19,125
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS ON THE 

6272
05:26:19,125 --> 05:26:19,492
PANEL, RIGHT? 

6273
05:26:19,492 --> 05:26:20,159
THINK ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS, CORY 

6274
05:26:20,159 --> 05:26:20,726
BOOKER, SOME OF THE MORE 

6275
05:26:20,726 --> 05:26:21,127
OUTSPOKEN FOLKS. 

6276
05:26:21,127 --> 05:26:21,761
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WALKED OUT 

6277
05:26:21,761 --> 05:26:22,395
EARLIER, LOOK AT THE ONES WHO 

6278
05:26:22,395 --> 05:26:22,929
ARE STAYED, THEY ARE THE 

6279
05:26:22,929 --> 05:26:23,529
INSTITUTIONALISTS, THE DICK 

6280
05:26:23,529 --> 05:26:24,130
DURBINS, THE PAT LEAHYS, THE 

6281
05:26:24,130 --> 05:26:24,730
DIANNE FEINSTEINS, THOSE WHO 

6282
05:26:24,730 --> 05:26:25,398
REALLY DON'T HAVE A FUTURE IN 

6283
05:26:25,398 --> 05:26:25,865
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

6284
05:26:25,865 --> 05:26:26,499
THOSE WHO DO, DICK BLUMENTHAL, 

6285
05:26:26,499 --> 05:26:27,099
MAZIE HIRONO, BOOKER, HARRIS, 

6286
05:26:27,099 --> 05:26:27,733
THEY NEEDED TO SHOW THE BASE 

6287
05:26:27,733 --> 05:26:28,401
THAT THEY HAD SPINE, AND THAT 

6288
05:26:28,401 --> 05:26:29,068
REALLY IS KIND OF THE WORD OF 

6289
05:26:29,068 --> 05:26:29,735
THE DAY FOR ME FOR DEMOCRATS IS 

6290
05:26:29,735 --> 05:26:29,969
SPINE. 

6291
05:26:29,969 --> 05:26:30,603
DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH STEEL IN 

6292
05:26:30,603 --> 05:26:31,170
THEIR SPINE TO SHOW THAT 

6293
05:26:31,170 --> 05:26:31,704
THEY'RE GOING TO RESIST, 

6294
05:26:31,704 --> 05:26:32,405
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO 

6295
05:26:32,405 --> 05:26:32,972
SAY I DISAGREE WITH THIS 

6296
05:26:32,972 --> 05:26:33,606
NOMINATION, I'M AGAINST IT, YOU 

6297
05:26:33,606 --> 05:26:34,207
HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE 

6298
05:26:34,207 --> 05:26:34,840
ACTIVELY GOING TO RESIST THIS 

6299
05:26:34,840 --> 05:26:35,141
PRESIDENT. 

6300
05:26:35,141 --> 05:26:35,675
THAT'S WHAT THE BASE IS 

6301
05:26:35,675 --> 05:26:35,975
EXPECTING. 

6302
05:26:35,975 --> 05:26:36,642
>> YOU KNOW, NIALL, ONE THING I 

6303
05:26:36,642 --> 05:26:37,243
KEEP HEARING OVER AND OVER 

6304
05:26:37,243 --> 05:26:37,843
AGAIN FROM REPUBLICANS, AND 

6305
05:26:37,843 --> 05:26:38,477
PARTICULARLY FEMALE REPUBLICANS 

6306
05:26:38,477 --> 05:26:39,045
I'VE SPOKEN TO, THEY COULD 

6307
05:26:39,045 --> 05:26:39,712
BRING THIS UP WAY EARLIER, WHY 

6308
05:26:39,712 --> 05:26:40,279
DID THEY PULL THESE DIRTY 

6309
05:26:40,279 --> 05:26:40,880
POLITICAL TRICKS AND TRY TO 

6310
05:26:40,880 --> 05:26:41,480
BRING THIS UP AT THE LAST 

6311
05:26:41,480 --> 05:26:42,014
MINUTE ON THE 11th HOUR? 

6312
05:26:42,014 --> 05:26:42,615
>> THAT IS DEFINITELY AN 

6313
05:26:42,615 --> 05:26:43,249
ARGUMENT WE'RE HEARING ON THE 

6314
05:26:43,249 --> 05:26:43,749
REPUBLICAN SIDE A LOT. 

6315
05:26:43,749 --> 05:26:44,350
I THINK IT'S CLEARLY IN THE 

6316
05:26:44,350 --> 05:26:45,017
REPUBLICAN INTEREST TO SUGGEST 

6317
05:26:45,017 --> 05:26:45,651
THAT THIS IS ALL POLITICAL -- 

6318
05:26:45,651 --> 05:26:46,319
THE MORE POLITICIZED IT IS, THE 

6319
05:26:46,319 --> 05:26:46,819
BETTER IT IS FOR BRETT 

6320
05:26:46,819 --> 05:26:47,320
KAVANAUGH'S CHANCES OF 

6321
05:26:47,320 --> 05:26:47,653
CONFIRMATION. 

6322
05:26:47,653 --> 05:26:48,354
BUT JUST TO PICK UP ON LESLIE'S 

6323
05:26:48,354 --> 05:26:48,988
POINT, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 

6324
05:26:48,988 --> 05:26:49,522
WE'RE ALL IN THE INSTANT 

6325
05:26:49,522 --> 05:26:50,022
REACTION BUSINESS, BUT 

6326
05:26:50,022 --> 05:26:50,623
YESTERDAY'S TESTIMONY WAS SO 

6327
05:26:50,623 --> 05:26:51,190
POWERFUL THAT I THINK WE'RE 

6328
05:26:51,190 --> 05:26:51,857
ONLY REALLY BEGINNING TO WORK 

6329
05:26:51,857 --> 05:26:52,458
THROUGH THE RAMIFICATIONS OF 

6330
05:26:52,458 --> 05:26:53,025
THAT WHICH COULD BE SEEN 

6331
05:26:53,025 --> 05:26:53,659
CERTAINLY IN THE MIDTERMS BUT 

6332
05:26:53,659 --> 05:26:54,060
ALSO BEYOND THAT. 

6333
05:26:54,060 --> 05:26:54,727
IF REPUBLICANS ARE PERCEIVED TO 

6334
05:26:54,727 --> 05:26:55,361
BE DISMISSIVE OF A WOMAN WHO 

6335
05:26:55,361 --> 05:26:55,995
DID BRING FORTH VERY CREDIBLE 

6336
05:26:55,995 --> 05:26:56,329
ALLEGATIONS. 

6337
05:26:56,329 --> 05:26:57,029
>> YOU COULD ALMOST POINT TO -- 

6338
05:26:57,029 --> 05:26:57,663
SO 2016 WAS A TURNING POINT FOR 

6339
05:26:57,663 --> 05:26:58,331
A LOT OF WOMEN TO SAY, OH, WE 

6340
05:26:58,331 --> 05:26:58,998
WANT TO GET INVOLVED, WE DON'T 

6341
05:26:58,998 --> 05:26:59,699
LIKE THIS, KIND OF THE COARSING 

6342
05:26:59,699 --> 05:27:00,366
OF THE CULTURE AND A LOT OF THE 

6343
05:27:00,366 --> 05:27:00,900
SEXISM THEY FELT, SEXIST 

6344
05:27:00,900 --> 05:27:01,167
COMMENTS. 

6345
05:27:01,167 --> 05:27:01,734
MORE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN THAN 

6346
05:27:01,734 --> 05:27:02,368
REPUBLICAN, BUT MORE WOMEN ARE 

6347
05:27:02,368 --> 05:27:02,768
RUNNING IN 2018. 

6348
05:27:02,768 --> 05:27:03,436
THERE IS A DIRECT CAUSE EFFECT 

6349
05:27:03,436 --> 05:27:03,803
THAT YOU SEE. 

6350
05:27:03,803 --> 05:27:04,437
AND I THINK WITH YOUNGER WOMEN 

6351
05:27:04,437 --> 05:27:05,104
OR MILLENNIAL WOMEN, WOMEN THAT 

6352
05:27:05,104 --> 05:27:05,738
ARE GETTING ENGAGED, IT'S NOT 

6353
05:27:05,738 --> 05:27:06,239
AN EASY CHOICE ANYMORE. 

6354
05:27:06,239 --> 05:27:06,906
IT'S REALLY -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S 

6355
05:27:06,906 --> 05:27:07,540
WHY SENATOR FLAKE AND SOME OF 

6356
05:27:07,540 --> 05:27:08,207
THESE OTHERS ARE HAVING SUCH A 

6357
05:27:08,207 --> 05:27:08,874
DIFFICULT TIME NOW IN THIS NEW 

6358
05:27:08,874 --> 05:27:09,542
POPULIST REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT 

6359
05:27:09,542 --> 05:27:10,276
IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT IS REALLY 

6360
05:27:10,276 --> 05:27:10,776
THE RIGHT THING TO DO? 

6361
05:27:10,776 --> 05:27:11,344
AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY 

6362
05:27:11,344 --> 05:27:12,011
WOMEN THAT FEEL THEY WANT TO 

6363
05:27:12,011 --> 05:27:12,612
KNOW MORE AND RUSHING THIS 

6364
05:27:12,612 --> 05:27:13,145
THROUGH WHICH IS A SLEUD 

6365
05:27:13,145 --> 05:27:13,779
POLITICAL MOVE IS -- SHREWD 

6366
05:27:13,779 --> 05:27:14,347
POLITICAL MOVE, IT'S ADVAN 

6367
05:27:14,347 --> 05:27:14,880
TEENAGOUS TO THE PARTY. 

6368
05:27:14,880 --> 05:27:15,548
BUT WHERE DO WE GO AFTER THAT? 

6369
05:27:15,548 --> 05:27:15,915
>> IT'S FUNNY. 

6370
05:27:15,915 --> 05:27:16,582
WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS PICKED 

6371
05:27:16,582 --> 05:27:17,216
INSTEAD OF AMY CONEY BARRETT, 

6372
05:27:17,216 --> 05:27:17,850
EVERYBODY SAID, OH, I THINK THE 

6373
05:27:17,850 --> 05:27:18,484
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO STAY OUT 

6374
05:27:18,484 --> 05:27:18,918
OF A CULTURE WAR. 

6375
05:27:18,918 --> 05:27:19,518
IF YOU PICK CONEY BARRETT, 

6376
05:27:19,518 --> 05:27:20,219
THAT'S A CULTURAL WAR THAT HE'S 

6377
05:27:20,219 --> 05:27:20,820
DOING TO RIAL UP HIS BASE. 

6378
05:27:20,820 --> 05:27:21,487
THIS HAS TURNED INTO A CULTURE 

6379
05:27:21,487 --> 05:27:21,687
WAR. 

6380
05:27:21,687 --> 05:27:22,288
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS 

6381
05:27:22,288 --> 05:27:22,555
EARLIER. 

6382
05:27:22,555 --> 05:27:23,189
THINK ABOUT THE INSIDE TALK OF 

6383
05:27:23,189 --> 05:27:23,923
WHAT IT'S LIKE AT SOME OF THESE 

6384
05:27:23,923 --> 05:27:24,590
PREP SCHOOLS, THESE CLUBBY TYPE 

6385
05:27:24,590 --> 05:27:25,224
OF ENVIRONMENTS AND THINGS OF 

6386
05:27:25,224 --> 05:27:25,825
THAT NATURE AND LOOK AT THE 

6387
05:27:25,825 --> 05:27:26,459
REACTION OF FOLKS LIKE LINDSAY 

6388
05:27:26,459 --> 05:27:26,826
GRAHAM, RIGHT? 

6389
05:27:26,826 --> 05:27:27,493
IT FEELS VERY EXCLUSIVE AND IT 

6390
05:27:27,493 --> 05:27:28,127
DOESN'T FEEL VERY INCLUSIVE. 

6391
05:27:28,127 --> 05:27:28,794
THIS IS NOT A FACE TO AMERICA 

6392
05:27:28,794 --> 05:27:29,428
THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S A LOT 

6393
05:27:29,428 --> 05:27:29,795
OF INCLUSIVITY. 

6394
05:27:29,795 --> 05:27:30,496
IT FEELS LIKE, AGAIN, THIS IS A 

6395
05:27:30,496 --> 05:27:31,163
CULTURE WAR LIKE WHOSE SIDE ARE 

6396
05:27:31,163 --> 05:27:31,397
YOU ON. 

6397
05:27:31,397 --> 05:27:32,131
IT FEELS LIKE THIS CAME UP HERE 

6398
05:27:32,131 --> 05:27:32,465
UNEXPECTEDLY. 

6399
05:27:32,465 --> 05:27:33,099
>> THAT WAS CERTAINLY A MOMENT, 

6400
05:27:33,099 --> 05:27:33,599
ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN. 

6401
05:27:33,599 --> 05:27:34,267
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT OVER 

6402
05:27:34,267 --> 05:27:34,667
AND OVER AGAIN. 

6403
05:27:34,667 --> 05:27:35,167
CAITLIN, AT THIS POINT 

6404
05:27:35,167 --> 05:27:35,735
DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED MANY 

6405
05:27:35,735 --> 05:27:35,968
THINGS. 

6406
05:27:35,968 --> 05:27:36,569
THEY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS, 

6407
05:27:36,569 --> 05:27:37,169
THEY DON'T HAVE THE VOTING 

6408
05:27:37,169 --> 05:27:37,803
POWER, IS THERE ANYTHING THEY 

6409
05:27:37,803 --> 05:27:38,471
CAN DO AT THIS POINT TO KEEP 

6410
05:27:38,471 --> 05:27:39,005
KAVANAUGH OFF THE COURT? 

6411
05:27:39,005 --> 05:27:39,572
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW THEY'RE 

6412
05:27:39,572 --> 05:27:40,206
TRYING TO APPLY PLEASURE NOT 

6413
05:27:40,206 --> 05:27:40,840
ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN CAUCUS 

6414
05:27:40,840 --> 05:27:41,507
TOGETHER, BUT TO APPLY PRESSURE 

6415
05:27:41,507 --> 05:27:42,174
ON LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND 

6416
05:27:42,174 --> 05:27:42,708
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE. 

6417
05:27:42,708 --> 05:27:43,342
WE'VE SEEN THAT OVER THE PAST 

6418
05:27:43,342 --> 05:27:44,043
COUPLE OF WEEKS IN TERMS OF THE 

6419
05:27:44,043 --> 05:27:44,477
ADVERTISING DOLLARS 

6420
05:27:44,477 --> 05:27:45,111
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT THOSE 

6421
05:27:45,111 --> 05:27:45,444
TWO SENATORS. 

6422
05:27:45,444 --> 05:27:46,112
SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO 

6423
05:27:46,112 --> 05:27:46,712
CREATE MOMENTUM TO PUT THE 

6424
05:27:46,712 --> 05:27:47,380
PLEASURE ON THOSE TWO SENATORS 

6425
05:27:47,380 --> 05:27:48,014
WHO HAVE BEEN SWING VOTES IN 

6426
05:27:48,014 --> 05:27:48,614
SOME CASES, HEALTHCARE WAS A 

6427
05:27:48,614 --> 05:27:49,115
GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT. 

6428
05:27:49,115 --> 05:27:49,715
THAT'S WHAT THEY COULD DO. 

6429
05:27:49,715 --> 05:27:50,283
IF IN FACT MURKOWSKI AND 

6430
05:27:50,283 --> 05:27:50,850
COLLINS AND THE REPUBLICAN 

6431
05:27:50,850 --> 05:27:51,484
CONFERENCE STAY TOGETHER AND 

6432
05:27:51,484 --> 05:27:52,151
PERHAPS PULL OFF SOMEONE LIKE A 

6433
05:27:52,151 --> 05:27:52,785
JOE MANCHIN WHO IS RUNNING FOR 

6434
05:27:52,785 --> 05:27:53,452
RE-ELECTION IN A STATE THAT THE 

6435
05:27:53,452 --> 05:27:54,053
PRESIDENT IS OVERWHELMINGLY 

6436
05:27:54,053 --> 05:27:54,687
POPULAR, THAT COULD INCENTIVIZE 

6437
05:27:54,687 --> 05:27:55,354
DEMOCRATS TO REALLY REV IT UP 

6438
05:27:55,354 --> 05:27:56,055
IN NOVEMBER AND SAY -- START TO 

6439
05:27:56,055 --> 05:27:56,656
KIND OF USE THE SUPREME COURT 

6440
05:27:56,656 --> 05:27:57,323
AND JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS AS AN 

6441
05:27:57,323 --> 05:27:57,923
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE THE WAY 

6442
05:27:57,923 --> 05:27:58,591
THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE FOR 

6443
05:27:58,591 --> 05:27:59,158
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. 

6444
05:27:59,158 --> 05:27:59,792
>> AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE 

6445
05:27:59,792 --> 05:28:00,426
WHO ARE NOT LEAVING IT UP TO 

6446
05:28:00,426 --> 05:28:01,027
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR THE 

6447
05:28:01,027 --> 05:28:01,460
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

6448
05:28:01,460 --> 05:28:02,061
TODAY WE ACTUALLY SAW SOME 

6449
05:28:02,061 --> 05:28:02,628
PROTESTERS IN AN ELEVATOR 

6450
05:28:02,628 --> 05:28:03,262
CONFRONTING SENATOR JEFF FLAKE 

6451
05:28:03,262 --> 05:28:03,863
AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HE WOULD 

6452
05:28:03,863 --> 05:28:04,163
VOTE YES. 

6453
05:28:04,163 --> 05:28:04,697
>> I TOLD IT BECAUSE I 

6454
05:28:04,697 --> 05:28:05,298
RECOGNIZED DR. FORD'S STORY 

6455
05:28:05,298 --> 05:28:05,931
THAT SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH. 

6456
05:28:05,931 --> 05:28:06,599
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING 

6457
05:28:06,599 --> 05:28:07,233
SOMEONE [ INAUDIBLE  ] TO SIT 

6458
05:28:07,233 --> 05:28:07,733
IN THE SUPREME COURT. 

6459
05:28:07,733 --> 05:28:08,167
THIS IS HORRIBLE. 

6460
05:28:08,167 --> 05:28:08,768
YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR 

6461
05:28:08,768 --> 05:28:09,001
FAMILY. 

6462
05:28:09,001 --> 05:28:09,402
THINK ABOUT THEM. 

6463
05:28:09,402 --> 05:28:09,869
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN. 

6464
05:28:09,869 --> 05:28:10,469
[ [ INDISCERNABLE ] WHAT ARE 

6465
05:28:10,469 --> 05:28:10,870
YOU DOING, SIR? 

6466
05:28:10,870 --> 05:28:11,504
>> I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE AND 

6467
05:28:11,504 --> 05:28:12,138
YOU'RE TELLING ALL WOMEN THAT 

6468
05:28:12,138 --> 05:28:12,772
THEY DON'T MATTER, THAT THEY 

6469
05:28:12,772 --> 05:28:13,406
SHOULD JUST STAY QUIET BECAUSE 

6470
05:28:13,406 --> 05:28:14,073
IF THEY TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED 

6471
05:28:14,073 --> 05:28:14,774
TO THEM, YOU'RE GOING TO IGNORE 

6472
05:28:14,774 --> 05:28:14,974
THEM. 

6473
05:28:14,974 --> 05:28:15,608
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME 

6474
05:28:15,608 --> 05:28:16,275
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING 

6475
05:28:16,275 --> 05:28:16,776
ALL WOMEN IN AMERICA. 

6476
05:28:16,776 --> 05:28:17,443
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING 

6477
05:28:17,443 --> 05:28:17,943
ALL WOMEN IN AMERICA. 

6478
05:28:17,943 --> 05:28:18,611
NEW ZEALAND IALL, AT THIS POINT 

6479
05:28:18,611 --> 05:28:19,312
DO -- NIALL, AT THIS POINT DO 

6480
05:28:19,312 --> 05:28:20,012
WE KNOW WHAT PLAYED INTO JEFF 

6481
05:28:20,012 --> 05:28:20,646
FLAKE ANNOUNCING HE'S GOING TO 

6482
05:28:20,646 --> 05:28:20,913
VOTE YES? 

6483
05:28:20,913 --> 05:28:21,547
>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN LOOK 

6484
05:28:21,547 --> 05:28:21,981
INSIDE OF HIS HEAD. 

6485
05:28:21,981 --> 05:28:22,581
I THINK JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN 

6486
05:28:22,581 --> 05:28:23,215
SOMEONE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN 

6487
05:28:23,215 --> 05:28:23,849
VERBALLY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT 

6488
05:28:23,849 --> 05:28:24,483
TRUMP, BUT THOSE ON THE LEFT 

6489
05:28:24,483 --> 05:28:25,117
SAID HE HAS NOT QUITE WALKED 

6490
05:28:25,117 --> 05:28:25,751
THE WALK THE WAY HE'S TALKED 

6491
05:28:25,751 --> 05:28:26,018
THE TALK. 

6492
05:28:26,018 --> 05:28:26,652
AND OBVIOUSLY THAT FOOTAGE YOU 

6493
05:28:26,652 --> 05:28:27,253
SHOWED WAS VERY EMOTIONALLY 

6494
05:28:27,253 --> 05:28:27,520
POWERFUL. 

6495
05:28:27,520 --> 05:28:28,187
WHERE JEFF FLAKE IS CONTESTING 

6496
05:28:28,187 --> 05:28:28,821
RE-ELECTION AGAIN, THAT COULD 

6497
05:28:28,821 --> 05:28:29,488
BE PROBLEMATIC, BUT HE'S NOT. 

6498
05:28:29,488 --> 05:28:30,122
I THINK THE FACT HE'S LEAVING 

6499
05:28:30,122 --> 05:28:30,756
THE SENATE MAKES IT A LITTLE 

6500
05:28:30,756 --> 05:28:31,390
BIT MORE SURPRISING TO SOME 

6501
05:28:31,390 --> 05:28:32,024
PEOPLE THAT HE HAS CHOSEN TO 

6502
05:28:32,024 --> 05:28:32,525
VOTE THE WAY HE HAS. 

6503
05:28:32,525 --> 05:28:33,059
HE HAS NOTHING TO LOSE 

6504
05:28:33,059 --> 05:28:33,559
ESSENTIALLY POLITICALLY 

6505
05:28:33,559 --> 05:28:33,826
SPEAKING. 

6506
05:28:33,826 --> 05:28:34,493
>> LESLIE, WALK US THROUGH THE 

6507
05:28:34,493 --> 05:28:35,061
POLITICS IN THE REPUBLICAN 

6508
05:28:35,061 --> 05:28:35,728
PARTY AT THIS POINT WHETHER YOU 

6509
05:28:35,728 --> 05:28:36,362
VOTE YES OR WHETHER YOU VOTE 

6510
05:28:36,362 --> 05:28:36,529
NO. 

6511
05:28:36,529 --> 05:28:37,196
>> WHEN YOU VOTE YES -- THE ONE 

6512
05:28:37,196 --> 05:28:37,830
THING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, AND 

6513
05:28:37,830 --> 05:28:38,431
I TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, 

6514
05:28:38,431 --> 05:28:39,098
THERE USED TO BE KIND OF THIS 

6515
05:28:39,098 --> 05:28:39,699
WHISPER ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, 

6516
05:28:39,699 --> 05:28:40,266
AND HE'S TALKED ABOUT IT 

6517
05:28:40,266 --> 05:28:40,866
BEFORE, THE REPUBLICANS THAT 

6518
05:28:40,866 --> 05:28:41,467
ARE THE SWAMP IN WASHINGTON 

6519
05:28:41,467 --> 05:28:42,168
THAT ARE AGAINST HIM, BUT AS HE 

6520
05:28:42,168 --> 05:28:42,702
CONTINUES TO WIN, GAINS 

6521
05:28:42,702 --> 05:28:43,402
MOMENTUM AND HE IN THE MIDTERMS 

6522
05:28:43,402 --> 05:28:44,036
WHERE YOU EXPECT A LARGE LOSS 

6523
05:28:44,036 --> 05:28:44,537
TRADITIONAL FIRST-TERM 

6524
05:28:44,537 --> 05:28:45,204
PRESIDENT, IT MAY ONLY BE FIVE 

6525
05:28:45,204 --> 05:28:45,905
OR SIX WHEN IT ALL SHAKES OUT. 

6526
05:28:45,905 --> 05:28:46,505
THE PRESIDENT HAS MANAGED TO 

6527
05:28:46,505 --> 05:28:47,173
HOLD THE LINE, SO THAT WHISPER 

6528
05:28:47,173 --> 05:28:47,773
-- THAT ROAR, EXCUSE ME, THE 

6529
05:28:47,773 --> 05:28:48,407
ROAR AGAINST THE PRESIDENT HAS 

6530
05:28:48,407 --> 05:28:48,908
NOW BECOME A WHISPER. 

6531
05:28:48,908 --> 05:28:49,442
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS THE 

6532
05:28:49,442 --> 05:28:50,042
MOMENTUM, THEY REALIZE THAT 

6533
05:28:50,042 --> 05:28:50,743
THIS IS ABOUT VOTES AND KIND OF 

6534
05:28:50,743 --> 05:28:51,277
THEIR OWN POLITICAL SKIN. 

6535
05:28:51,277 --> 05:28:51,911
THAT'S THE CALCULATION THAT'S 

6536
05:28:51,911 --> 05:28:52,278
HAPPENING HERE. 

6537
05:28:52,278 --> 05:28:52,878
BUT, AGAIN, WHAT WE'VE BEEN 

6538
05:28:52,878 --> 05:28:53,546
TALKING ABOUT IS THIS IS MORE 

6539
05:28:53,546 --> 05:28:53,979
NUANCED THAN THAT. 

6540
05:28:53,979 --> 05:28:54,580
WHAT ARE WE SEEING AS THE 

6541
05:28:54,580 --> 05:28:55,214
REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHAT DO WE 

6542
05:28:55,214 --> 05:28:55,881
FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IN AT ANY 

6543
05:28:55,881 --> 05:28:56,082
COST? 

6544
05:28:56,082 --> 05:28:56,716
AND I THINK THE IRONY HERE, AS 

6545
05:28:56,716 --> 05:28:57,350
YOU SEE ALL THIS EMOTION, AND 

6546
05:28:57,350 --> 05:28:57,917
THEY'RE SAYING IF -- THE 

6547
05:28:57,917 --> 05:28:58,551
EMOTION AROUND THESE WOMEN WHO 

6548
05:28:58,551 --> 05:28:59,051
ARE TALKING ABOUT THESE 

6549
05:28:59,051 --> 05:28:59,552
CHARGES, BUT IT'S THE 

6550
05:28:59,552 --> 05:29:00,152
REPUBLICAN MEN RIGHT NOW WHO 

6551
05:29:00,152 --> 05:29:00,786
HAVE SO MUCH EMOTION, NOT ONLY 

6552
05:29:00,786 --> 05:29:01,387
WITH KAVANAUGH, BUT LINDSAY 

6553
05:29:01,387 --> 05:29:01,954
GRAHAM AND SOME OF THESE 

6554
05:29:01,954 --> 05:29:02,188
OTHERS. 

6555
05:29:02,188 --> 05:29:02,855
SO I THINK WE'RE JUST LOST IN 

6556
05:29:02,855 --> 05:29:03,556
TERMS OF WHERE THIS IS GOING TO 

6557
05:29:03,556 --> 05:29:04,156
BE, WIN AT ALL COST, BUT THE 

6558
05:29:04,156 --> 05:29:04,690
FUTURE RAMIFICATIONS ARE 

6559
05:29:04,690 --> 05:29:04,957
UNKNOWN. 

6560
05:29:04,957 --> 05:29:05,591
>>I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU -- 

6561
05:29:05,591 --> 05:29:06,258
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF 

6562
05:29:06,258 --> 05:29:06,892
IMPASSIONED ARGUMENTS ON BOTH 

6563
05:29:06,892 --> 05:29:07,126
SIDES. 

6564
05:29:07,126 --> 05:29:07,760
SENATOR DIANE DIANNE FEINSTEIN 

6565
05:29:07,760 --> 05:29:08,427
HAD THIS TO SAY ACTUALLY ABOUT 

6566
05:29:08,427 --> 05:29:08,994
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S BEHAVIOR 

6567
05:29:08,994 --> 05:29:09,628
DURING THE HEARING YESTERDAY. 

6568
05:29:09,628 --> 05:29:10,196
>> THIS WAS NOT SOMEONE WHO 

6569
05:29:10,196 --> 05:29:10,696
REFLECTED AN IMPARTIAL 

6570
05:29:10,696 --> 05:29:11,364
TEMPERAMENT OR THE FAIRNESS AND 

6571
05:29:11,364 --> 05:29:12,031
EVENHANDEDNESS ONE WOULD SEE IN 

6572
05:29:12,031 --> 05:29:12,298
A JUDGE. 

6573
05:29:12,298 --> 05:29:12,832
THIS WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS 

6574
05:29:12,832 --> 05:29:13,432
AGGRESSIVE AND BELLIGERENT. 

6575
05:29:13,432 --> 05:29:14,066
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE WHO 

6576
05:29:14,066 --> 05:29:14,700
WANTS TO BE ELEVATED TO THE 

6577
05:29:14,700 --> 05:29:15,301
HIGHEST COURT IN OUR COUNTRY 

6578
05:29:15,301 --> 05:29:15,801
BEHAVE IN THAT MANNER. 

6579
05:29:15,801 --> 05:29:16,435
>> SENATOR KLOBUCHAR ACTUALLY 

6580
05:29:16,435 --> 05:29:17,136
TOLD "CBS THIS MORNING" THAT IF 

6581
05:29:17,136 --> 05:29:17,770
SHE HAD ACTED THE WAY KAVANAUGH 

6582
05:29:17,770 --> 05:29:18,437
DID IN THE COURTROOM, SHE WOULD 

6583
05:29:18,437 --> 05:29:19,071
HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT AT THIS 

6584
05:29:19,071 --> 05:29:19,305
POINT. 

6585
05:29:19,305 --> 05:29:20,005
JOEL, IS THIS JUST A DEMOCRATIC 

6586
05:29:20,005 --> 05:29:20,439
TALKING POINT ABOUT 

6587
05:29:20,439 --> 05:29:20,773
TEMPERAMENT? 

6588
05:29:20,773 --> 05:29:21,006
>> NO. 

6589
05:29:21,006 --> 05:29:21,574
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS 

6590
05:29:21,574 --> 05:29:22,108
YESTERDAY, I THINK THAT 

6591
05:29:22,108 --> 05:29:22,675
KAVANAUGH MAY HAVE WON THE 

6592
05:29:22,675 --> 05:29:23,342
BATTLE FOR SAVING HIS SKIN FOR 

6593
05:29:23,342 --> 05:29:23,876
THE DAY IN TERMS OF THE 

6594
05:29:23,876 --> 05:29:24,243
BELIEVABILITY. 

6595
05:29:24,243 --> 05:29:24,877
BUT I THINK HE LOST THE WAR. 

6596
05:29:24,877 --> 05:29:25,544
I DON'T THINK HE SHOWED HIMSELF 

6597
05:29:25,544 --> 05:29:26,245
TO HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE A 

6598
05:29:26,245 --> 05:29:26,746
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 

6599
05:29:26,746 --> 05:29:27,313
AGAIN, I BROUGHT THIS UP. 

6600
05:29:27,313 --> 05:29:27,847
IF YOU'RE A GROUP THAT'S 

6601
05:29:27,847 --> 05:29:28,481
PROGRESSIVE OR THAT'S, QUOTE, 

6602
05:29:28,481 --> 05:29:29,148
LEFT WING AND YOU'RE COMING FOR 

6603
05:29:29,148 --> 05:29:29,815
THE COURT, IF YOU'RE A PLANNED 

6604
05:29:29,815 --> 05:29:30,449
PARENTHOOD, IF YOU'RE SOMEONE 

6605
05:29:30,449 --> 05:29:31,117
WHO OBVIOUSLY FALLS ON THE LEFT 

6606
05:29:31,117 --> 05:29:31,784
SIDE, I MEAN, THIS IS AN IDEA 

6607
05:29:31,784 --> 05:29:32,418
LOG, A SERIOUS IDEALOGUE, NOT 

6608
05:29:32,418 --> 05:29:33,052
JUST IN THE ABSTRACT, THIS IS 

6609
05:29:33,052 --> 05:29:33,652
SOMEBODY WHO IS A POLITICAL 

6610
05:29:33,652 --> 05:29:34,253
OPERATIVE FOR THE REPUBLICAN 

6611
05:29:34,253 --> 05:29:34,920
PARTY WHO'S NOW GOING TO BE ON 

6612
05:29:34,920 --> 05:29:35,488
THE SUPREME COURT IT SEEMS 

6613
05:29:35,488 --> 05:29:35,688
LIKE. 

6614
05:29:35,688 --> 05:29:36,288
SO I THINK THAT'S GOTTA BE 

6615
05:29:36,288 --> 05:29:36,689
REALLY TROUBLING. 

6616
05:29:36,689 --> 05:29:37,256
ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO 

6617
05:29:37,256 --> 05:29:37,857
MENTION HERE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE 

6618
05:29:37,857 --> 05:29:38,524
THINKING ABOUT WHO'S VOTING AND 

6619
05:29:38,524 --> 05:29:39,158
HOW PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT 

6620
05:29:39,158 --> 05:29:39,392
VOTING. 

6621
05:29:39,392 --> 05:29:39,992
IF YOU'RE JOE MANCHIN, OKAY, 

6622
05:29:39,992 --> 05:29:40,659
JUST READING THE TEA LEAVES, IT 

6623
05:29:40,659 --> 05:29:41,293
ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR 

6624
05:29:41,293 --> 05:29:41,961
YOU IF YOU WERE GOING TO BE A 

6625
05:29:41,961 --> 05:29:42,661
NO VOTE ON KAVANAUGH TO DO IT A 

6626
05:29:42,661 --> 05:29:43,362
LITTLE BIT EARLIER, KIND OF DO 

6627
05:29:43,362 --> 05:29:44,029
WHAT JOE DONNELLY DID A LITTLE 

6628
05:29:44,029 --> 05:29:44,663
BIT EARLIER TODAY, NOT BE THE 

6629
05:29:44,663 --> 05:29:45,030
LAST ONE OUT. 

6630
05:29:45,030 --> 05:29:45,731
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE GAME OF 

6631
05:29:45,731 --> 05:29:46,365
HOT POTATO, WHO'S LEFT HOLDING 

6632
05:29:46,365 --> 05:29:46,832
THE BAG AT THE END. 

6633
05:29:46,832 --> 05:29:47,400
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT. 

6634
05:29:47,400 --> 05:29:48,000
SO THAT TELLS ME A LITTLE 

6635
05:29:48,000 --> 05:29:48,567
SOMETHING ABOUT MAYBE WHAT 

6636
05:29:48,567 --> 05:29:49,168
MANCHIN IS THINKING WITH NO 

6637
05:29:49,168 --> 05:29:49,769
INFORMATION TO WORK OFF OF. 

6638
05:29:49,769 --> 05:29:50,436
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE, YOU 

6639
05:29:50,436 --> 05:29:51,036
KNOW, BOXED IN AS THE LAST 

6640
05:29:51,036 --> 05:29:51,704
PERSON, THE PERSON WHO'S REALLY 

6641
05:29:51,704 --> 05:29:52,271
IN THE TARGET ZONE, YOU'D 

6642
05:29:52,271 --> 05:29:52,938
PROBABLY WANT TO ANNOUNCE YOUR 

6643
05:29:52,938 --> 05:29:53,539
DECISION A LITTLE EARLIER. 

6644
05:29:53,539 --> 05:29:54,106
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME 

6645
05:29:54,106 --> 05:29:54,774
INSIGHT INTO WHAT JOE MAN DLIP 

6646
05:29:54,774 --> 05:29:55,408
CHIN MIGHT BE THINK -- MANCHIN 

6647
05:29:55,408 --> 05:29:55,841
MIGHT BE THINKING. 

6648
05:29:55,841 --> 05:29:56,442
>> I KNOW SOME OF THIS IS 

6649
05:29:56,442 --> 05:29:57,109
SUSPENSE AND THEE AT RICKS AND 

6650
05:29:57,109 --> 05:29:57,777
DRAMA AND COO BOOKIE BOOKIE KA 

6651
05:29:57,777 --> 05:29:58,177
BOOKIE THEATER. 

6652
05:29:58,177 --> 05:29:58,778
DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE 

6653
05:29:58,778 --> 05:29:59,078
RIGHT NOW? 

6654
05:29:59,078 --> 05:29:59,712
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS ON 

6655
05:29:59,712 --> 05:30:00,379
THE PART OF MAPCHIN AND COLLINS 

6656
05:30:00,379 --> 05:30:01,046
AND MUR -- MANCHIN, COLLINS AND 

6657
05:30:01,046 --> 05:30:01,347
MURKOWSKI. 

6658
05:30:01,347 --> 05:30:01,914
WE'RE HEARING REPORTS THAT 

6659
05:30:01,914 --> 05:30:02,448
COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI ARE 

6660
05:30:02,448 --> 05:30:03,015
DISCUSSING MOVING TOGETHER 

6661
05:30:03,015 --> 05:30:03,616
PERHAPS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. 

6662
05:30:03,616 --> 05:30:04,283
THAT WILL BE FASCINATING IF IT 

6663
05:30:04,283 --> 05:30:04,950
HAPPENS YES IT IS -- YOU WOULD 

6664
05:30:04,950 --> 05:30:05,618
THINK IT WOULD BE CLEAR ENOUGH 

6665
05:30:05,618 --> 05:30:06,185
BY NOW, BUT I THINK THERE'S 

6666
05:30:06,185 --> 05:30:06,786
GENUINE SUSPENSE AND GENUINE 

6667
05:30:06,786 --> 05:30:07,353
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THIS VOTE 

6668
05:30:07,353 --> 05:30:07,586
STILL. 

6669
05:30:07,586 --> 05:30:08,254
>> I WANT TO CHING IN -- CHECK 

6670
05:30:08,254 --> 05:30:08,821
IN WITH ANGELICA ALVAREZ. 

6671
05:30:08,821 --> 05:30:09,388
WHAT'S THE LATEST THERE? 

6672
05:30:09,388 --> 05:30:09,889
>>REPORTER:  HI, YES. 

6673
05:30:09,889 --> 05:30:10,589
WE ARE WAITING ON THAT VOTE, IT 

6674
05:30:10,589 --> 05:30:11,190
SHOULD BE COMING AT 1:30. 

6675
05:30:11,190 --> 05:30:11,757
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'VE BEEN 

6676
05:30:11,757 --> 05:30:12,291
HEARING FROM THE SENATE 

6677
05:30:12,291 --> 05:30:12,925
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND HEARING 

6678
05:30:12,925 --> 05:30:13,526
FROM BOTH SIDES, A LOT OF 

6679
05:30:13,526 --> 05:30:14,126
PASSION ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH 

6680
05:30:14,126 --> 05:30:15,294
SIDES OF THE AISLE, REPUBLICANS 

6681
05:30:15,294 --> 05:30:15,428
 

6682
05:30:15,428 --> 05:30:16,028
WE HEARD YESTERDAY, SIMPLY 

6683
05:30:16,028 --> 05:30:16,529
ANGRY ABOUT THE PROCESS 

6684
05:30:16,529 --> 05:30:16,962
ACCORDING TO THEM. 

6685
05:30:16,962 --> 05:30:17,630
IN THEIR OPINION THEY FEEL THE 

6686
05:30:17,630 --> 05:30:18,130
DEMOCRATS HAVE REALLY 

6687
05:30:18,130 --> 05:30:18,764
MISTREATED JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

6688
05:30:18,764 --> 05:30:19,131
EVEN DR. FORD. 

6689
05:30:19,131 --> 05:30:19,765
WE'RE ALSO HEARING ANGER FROM 

6690
05:30:19,765 --> 05:30:20,232
THE DEMOCRATS' SIDE. 

6691
05:30:20,232 --> 05:30:20,900
THEY ARE UPSET THAT THEY HAVE 

6692
05:30:20,900 --> 05:30:21,600
NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE F.B.I. 

6693
05:30:21,600 --> 05:30:22,201
INVESTIGATION, THEY'VE ASKED 

6694
05:30:22,201 --> 05:30:22,902
FOR IT REPEATEDLY AND THEY HAVE 

6695
05:30:22,902 --> 05:30:23,569
ALSO SAID THAT THEY HAVE NOT 

6696
05:30:23,569 --> 05:30:24,203
BEEN ABLE TO SWAY REPUBLICANS 

6697
05:30:24,203 --> 05:30:24,637
TO DELAY THE VOTE. 

6698
05:30:24,637 --> 05:30:25,171
>> ALL RIGHT, ANGELICA. 

6699
05:30:25,171 --> 05:30:25,805
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 

6700
05:30:25,805 --> 05:30:25,971
US. 

6701
05:30:25,971 --> 05:30:26,672
I WANT TO TURN BACK NOW TO OUR 

6702
05:30:26,672 --> 05:30:26,906
PANEL. 

6703
05:30:26,906 --> 05:30:27,573
LESLIE, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 

6704
05:30:27,573 --> 05:30:28,207
THIS, I THINK THERE WAS A COOK 

6705
05:30:28,207 --> 05:30:28,741
REPORT LAST WEEK, THERE'S 

6706
05:30:28,741 --> 05:30:29,341
CONCERN THAT PARTICULARLY THE 

6707
05:30:29,341 --> 05:30:29,975
HISPANIC VOTING BLOCK MIGHT NOT 

6708
05:30:29,975 --> 05:30:30,643
COME OUT TO VOTE IN MIDTERMS 

6709
05:30:30,643 --> 05:30:31,210
WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I WAS 

6710
05:30:31,210 --> 05:30:31,510
SURPRISED. 

6711
05:30:31,510 --> 05:30:32,178
IF THERE'S ONE SECTOR OF THIS 

6712
05:30:32,178 --> 05:30:32,845
COUNTRY THAT HAS A LOT TO LOSE, 

6713
05:30:32,845 --> 05:30:33,446
IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE THIS 

6714
05:30:33,446 --> 05:30:33,679
GROUP. 

6715
05:30:33,679 --> 05:30:34,346
SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

6716
05:30:34,346 --> 05:30:35,014
THE HISPANIC VOTERS AND WHO DO 

6717
05:30:35,014 --> 05:30:35,614
YOU THINK IN PARTICULAR IF 

6718
05:30:35,614 --> 05:30:36,315
KAVANAUGH DOES MAKE IT ONTO THE 

6719
05:30:36,315 --> 05:30:36,982
COURT, WHO DOES THIS MOBILIZE 

6720
05:30:36,982 --> 05:30:37,183
MORE? 

6721
05:30:37,183 --> 05:30:37,783
>> THE INTERESTING PART, WE 

6722
05:30:37,783 --> 05:30:38,417
HAVE WANTED FOR GENERATIONS FOR 

6723
05:30:38,417 --> 05:30:39,051
LATINOS OR ANY MINORITY GROUP 

6724
05:30:39,051 --> 05:30:39,652
TO REALLY BE GALVANIZED AND 

6725
05:30:39,652 --> 05:30:40,319
VOTE TO THEIR NUMBERS, TO THEIR 

6726
05:30:40,319 --> 05:30:40,886
POLITICAL POWER, BUT THEY 

6727
05:30:40,886 --> 05:30:41,120
DON'T. 

6728
05:30:41,120 --> 05:30:41,754
BUT THE ISSUE WITH LATINOS IS 

6729
05:30:41,754 --> 05:30:42,421
THEY TEND TO TURN OUT MORE IN 

6730
05:30:42,421 --> 05:30:42,955
NATIONAL ELECTIONS THAN 

6731
05:30:42,955 --> 05:30:43,589
MIDTERMS BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFY 

6732
05:30:43,589 --> 05:30:44,223
WITH THE PERSON WHO'S AT THE 

6733
05:30:44,223 --> 05:30:44,790
TOP OF THE TICKET, NOT THE 

6734
05:30:44,790 --> 05:30:45,024
PARTY. 

6735
05:30:45,024 --> 05:30:45,658
WE DID A LOTZ OF POLLING FOR 

6736
05:30:45,658 --> 05:30:46,292
YEARS AND IF YOU SAY YOU KNOW 

6737
05:30:46,292 --> 05:30:46,492
WHAT? 

6738
05:30:46,492 --> 05:30:47,126
YOU KNOW, JUST THE REFERENCES, 

6739
05:30:47,126 --> 05:30:47,726
THE ELEPHANT AND THE DONKEY, 

6740
05:30:47,726 --> 05:30:48,394
WHICH IS WHICH, YOU HAVE A LOT 

6741
05:30:48,394 --> 05:30:49,061
OF NEW VOTERS WHO DON'T NASAILY 

6742
05:30:49,061 --> 05:30:49,261
KNOW. 

6743
05:30:49,261 --> 05:30:49,862
SO THE STEREOTYPES THAT THE 

6744
05:30:49,862 --> 05:30:50,529
PARTIES FALL INTO, IT'S NOT AN 

6745
05:30:50,529 --> 05:30:51,163
EASY LINE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 

6746
05:30:51,163 --> 05:30:51,797
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR NEWER 

6747
05:30:51,797 --> 05:30:52,298
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. 

6748
05:30:52,298 --> 05:30:52,898
BUT ON THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE 

6749
05:30:52,898 --> 05:30:53,532
TALKING ABOUT, WHETHER IT IS 

6750
05:30:53,532 --> 05:30:54,166
THE RAIDS, WHETHER IT IS THE 

6751
05:30:54,166 --> 05:30:54,800
DREAMERS, WHETHER IT'S BUILDING 

6752
05:30:54,800 --> 05:30:55,401
THE WALL, THERE'S CERTAINLY A 

6753
05:30:55,401 --> 05:30:55,868
LOT OF CONVERSATION. 

6754
05:30:55,868 --> 05:30:56,502
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS 

6755
05:30:56,502 --> 05:30:57,069
YOU HAVE MORE CANDIDATES 

6756
05:30:57,069 --> 05:30:57,336
RUNNING. 

6757
05:30:57,336 --> 05:30:57,937
THE POLITICAL POWER, WHETHER 

6758
05:30:57,937 --> 05:30:58,537
IT'S GENDER OR ETHNIC IT'S 

6759
05:30:58,537 --> 05:30:59,171
ACTUALLY WHEN PEOPLE RUN AND 

6760
05:30:59,171 --> 05:30:59,839
GAL SLP VANNIZE, NOT WHEN THEY 

6761
05:30:59,839 --> 05:31:00,473
VOTE BECAUSE THEY DON'T TURN 

6762
05:31:00,473 --> 05:31:01,140
OUT, BUT WHEN THEY DECIDE TO 

6763
05:31:01,140 --> 05:31:01,774
THROW THEIR HAND IN THE RING 

6764
05:31:01,774 --> 05:31:02,408
AND RUN AND RAISE MONEY AROUND 

6765
05:31:02,408 --> 05:31:03,075
THAT, THAT'S WHEN THAT STARTS 

6766
05:31:03,075 --> 05:31:03,642
TO BECOME SO INTERESTING. 

6767
05:31:03,642 --> 05:31:04,343
>> CAITLIN, THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN 

6768
05:31:04,343 --> 05:31:05,010
A CONCERN THAT DEMOCRATS AREN'T 

6769
05:31:05,010 --> 05:31:05,611
ABLE TO GET THE VOTE OUT, 

6770
05:31:05,611 --> 05:31:06,245
ESPECIALLY MIDTERMS, IT'S ALL 

6771
05:31:06,245 --> 05:31:06,612
ABOUT TURNOUT. 

6772
05:31:06,612 --> 05:31:07,213
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE 

6773
05:31:07,213 --> 05:31:07,880
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHAT ARE THEY 

6774
05:31:07,880 --> 05:31:08,547
MOST CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW? 

6775
05:31:08,547 --> 05:31:09,181
>> WELL, CERTAINLY THE PRIMARY 

6776
05:31:09,181 --> 05:31:09,748
SHOWED AN INTENSE LEVEL OF 

6777
05:31:09,748 --> 05:31:10,349
ENTHUSIASM AMONG DEMOCRATIC 

6778
05:31:10,349 --> 05:31:11,016
VOTERS WHICH IS REMARKABLE FOR 

6779
05:31:11,016 --> 05:31:11,584
A PRIMARY AND ALSO MIDTERM 

6780
05:31:11,584 --> 05:31:12,251
ELECTIONS, BECAUSE AS WE KNOW 

6781
05:31:12,251 --> 05:31:12,952
REPUBLICANS TEND TO TURN OUT IN 

6782
05:31:12,952 --> 05:31:13,552
HIGHER NUMBERS THAN DEMOCRATS 

6783
05:31:13,552 --> 05:31:14,220
JUST IN TERMS OF THEIR VOTING 

6784
05:31:14,220 --> 05:31:14,920
BASE MORE OLDER VOTERS TEND TO 

6785
05:31:14,920 --> 05:31:15,521
BE MORE RELIABLE IN TURNING 

6786
05:31:15,521 --> 05:31:15,721
OUT. 

6787
05:31:15,721 --> 05:31:16,322
THE BIG QUESTION I HAVE IS 

6788
05:31:16,322 --> 05:31:16,956
THERE A CEILING FOR DEMOCRATIC 

6789
05:31:16,956 --> 05:31:17,590
ENTHUSISM, IN OTHER WORDS, CAN 

6790
05:31:17,590 --> 05:31:18,157
THEY BE MORE MOBILIZED AND 

6791
05:31:18,157 --> 05:31:18,757
ENERGIZED THAN THEY ALREADY 

6792
05:31:18,757 --> 05:31:18,958
ARE. 

6793
05:31:18,958 --> 05:31:19,592
AND SOME DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS 

6794
05:31:19,592 --> 05:31:20,159
SAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT 

6795
05:31:20,159 --> 05:31:20,826
COULD START TO BECOME SOMETHING 

6796
05:31:20,826 --> 05:31:21,427
THAT REALLY MOTIVATES PEOPLE, 

6797
05:31:21,427 --> 05:31:21,961
KIND OF CRYSTALLIZES THE 

6798
05:31:21,961 --> 05:31:22,561
IMPORTANCE OF SHOWING UP TO 

6799
05:31:22,561 --> 05:31:22,761
VOTE. 

6800
05:31:22,761 --> 05:31:23,429
SO NOT ONLY EXPRESSING ENERGY 

6801
05:31:23,429 --> 05:31:23,996
AND ENTHUSIASM AND SAYING 

6802
05:31:23,996 --> 05:31:24,563
YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE, BUT 

6803
05:31:24,563 --> 05:31:25,197
ACTUALLY TURNING OUT TO VOTE. 

6804
05:31:25,197 --> 05:31:25,764
THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF 

6805
05:31:25,764 --> 05:31:26,198
COMPLACENCY, RIGHT? 

6806
05:31:26,198 --> 05:31:26,765
WE SAW THAT A LITTLE BIT 

6807
05:31:26,765 --> 05:31:27,266
LEADING INTO 2016 WHERE 

6808
05:31:27,266 --> 05:31:27,900
DEMOCRATS WERE LOOKING AT THE 

6809
05:31:27,900 --> 05:31:28,467
NATIONAL POLLS AND SEEING 

6810
05:31:28,467 --> 05:31:29,101
CLINTON AHEAD AND THERE WASN'T 

6811
05:31:29,101 --> 05:31:29,768
THE TURNOUT THAT SHE NEEDED TO 

6812
05:31:29,768 --> 05:31:30,169
WIN THE ELECTION. 

6813
05:31:30,169 --> 05:31:30,769
THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT 

6814
05:31:30,769 --> 05:31:31,437
DEMOCRATS WON'T TURN OUT AT THE 

6815
05:31:31,437 --> 05:31:32,071
LEVEL THAT THEY'RE EXPRESSING 

6816
05:31:32,071 --> 05:31:32,271
NOW. 

6817
05:31:32,271 --> 05:31:32,905
SO IT'S TRYING TO KEEP YOUR 

6818
05:31:32,905 --> 05:31:33,572
BASE REVVED UP BUT ALSO TO GET 

6819
05:31:33,572 --> 05:31:34,173
THEM OUT TO ACTUALLY VOTE. 

6820
05:31:34,173 --> 05:31:34,874
OF COURSE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 

6821
05:31:34,874 --> 05:31:35,508
CORE CONSTITUENCIES THAT WE'RE 

6822
05:31:35,508 --> 05:31:36,008
LOOKING AT AND WOMEN, 

6823
05:31:36,008 --> 05:31:36,575
PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE 

6824
05:31:36,575 --> 05:31:37,142
SUBURBS, IN THESE DISTRICTS 

6825
05:31:37,142 --> 05:31:37,776
THAT COULD DECIDE CONTROL OF 

6826
05:31:37,776 --> 05:31:38,477
CONGRESS HOW THEY WILL REACT TO 

6827
05:31:38,477 --> 05:31:39,111
KAVANAUGH, WHETHER THEY REACT 

6828
05:31:39,111 --> 05:31:39,778
TO IT INDIVIDUALLY OR TAKE IT 

6829
05:31:39,778 --> 05:31:40,446
IN THE AGGREGATE, I THINK THERE 

6830
05:31:40,446 --> 05:31:41,080
ARE STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 

6831
05:31:41,080 --> 05:31:41,747
AND WOMEN AS WE KNOW ARE NOT A 

6832
05:31:41,747 --> 05:31:42,414
MONOLITHIC GROUP, SO YOU'VE HAD 

6833
05:31:42,414 --> 05:31:43,082
SOME -- TRUMP LIKES TO SAY HE 

6834
05:31:43,082 --> 05:31:43,682
WON WOMEN VOTERS, THAT'S NOT 

6835
05:31:43,682 --> 05:31:44,350
TRUE, BUT HE WON A MAJORITY OF 

6836
05:31:44,350 --> 05:31:44,950
WHITE WOMEN VOTERS, SO THEY 

6837
05:31:44,950 --> 05:31:45,484
MIGHT REACT TO KAVANAUGH 

6838
05:31:45,484 --> 05:31:45,818
DIFFERENTLY. 

6839
05:31:45,818 --> 05:31:46,452
THEN YOU HAVE WOMEN LIVING IN 

6840
05:31:46,452 --> 05:31:47,052
OTHER AREAS OR -- IT JUST 

6841
05:31:47,052 --> 05:31:47,686
REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW THEY'RE 

6842
05:31:47,686 --> 05:31:48,320
KIND OF DIGESTING AND ABSORBING 

6843
05:31:48,320 --> 05:31:48,988
THIS WHICH, AGAIN, SPEAKS TO 

6844
05:31:48,988 --> 05:31:49,588
THE TIMELINE WHY REPUBLICANS 

6845
05:31:49,588 --> 05:31:50,189
WANT TO GET THIS OUT NOW. 

6846
05:31:50,189 --> 05:31:50,856
>> SPEAKING OF TIMELINE, I WANT 

6847
05:31:50,856 --> 05:31:51,423
TO REMIND EVERYONE YOU'RE 

6848
05:31:51,423 --> 05:31:52,024
WATCHING RIGHT HERE SENATE 

6849
05:31:52,024 --> 05:31:52,658
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ANY MOMENT 

6850
05:31:52,658 --> 05:31:53,325
NOW WE ARE THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

6851
05:31:53,325 --> 05:31:53,959
COMMITTEE TO VOTE TO VOTE ON 

6852
05:31:53,959 --> 05:31:54,527
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 

6853
05:31:54,527 --> 05:31:54,827
KAVANAUGH. 

6854
05:31:54,827 --> 05:31:55,494
IT'S A VOTE TO GET IT TO THE 

6855
05:31:55,494 --> 05:31:56,095
VOTE TO GET IT TO THE VOTE. 

6856
05:31:56,095 --> 05:31:56,695
DID I GET THAT RIGHT, GUYS? 

6857
05:31:56,695 --> 05:31:57,363
>> YOU MISSED ONE VOTE MAYBE. 

6858
05:31:57,363 --> 05:31:57,863
>> I MISSED ONE VOTE. 

6859
05:31:57,863 --> 05:31:58,531
SO THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE THIS 

6860
05:31:58,531 --> 05:31:59,131
OUT OF COMMITTEE, AND THEN 

6861
05:31:59,131 --> 05:31:59,665
TOMORROW WE ARE EXPECTING 

6862
05:31:59,665 --> 05:32:00,366
POTENTIALLY THIS WILL GO TO THE 

6863
05:32:00,366 --> 05:32:00,599
SENATE. 

6864
05:32:00,599 --> 05:32:01,233
A LOT CAN HAPPEN AS WE HAVE 

6865
05:32:01,233 --> 05:32:01,867
DISCOVERED IN JUST ONE DAY. 

6866
05:32:01,867 --> 05:32:02,501
WE ARE EXPECTING 1:30, THOUGH, 

6867
05:32:02,501 --> 05:32:03,068
THIS IS WHEN THE VOTE IS 

6868
05:32:03,068 --> 05:32:03,602
EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE. 

6869
05:32:03,602 --> 05:32:04,336
WE DO KNOW -- NIALL, I WANT TO 

6870
05:32:04,336 --> 05:32:04,904
GO BACK TO YOU ABOUT THIS, 

6871
05:32:04,904 --> 05:32:05,538
THOSE FOUR DEMOCRATS WHO CHOSE 

6872
05:32:05,538 --> 05:32:06,005
TODAY TO WALK OUT. 

6873
05:32:06,005 --> 05:32:06,605
TAKE US BACK AND SORT OF 

6874
05:32:06,605 --> 05:32:07,239
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED TODAY. 

6875
05:32:07,239 --> 05:32:07,740
>> SO ESSENTIALLY CHUCK 

6876
05:32:07,740 --> 05:32:08,274
GRASSLEY THE REPUBLICAN 

6877
05:32:08,274 --> 05:32:08,774
CHAIRMAN WAS READING A 

6878
05:32:08,774 --> 05:32:09,308
STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF 

6879
05:32:09,308 --> 05:32:09,909
KAVANAUGH, AND AT THAT POINT 

6880
05:32:09,909 --> 05:32:10,576
FOUR DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WALKED 

6881
05:32:10,576 --> 05:32:10,776
OUT. 

6882
05:32:10,776 --> 05:32:11,410
THE MOST PROMINENT AMONG THEM 

6883
05:32:11,410 --> 05:32:12,044
IS SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS OF 

6884
05:32:12,044 --> 05:32:12,344
CALIFORNIA. 

6885
05:32:12,344 --> 05:32:12,912
SHE'S ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS 

6886
05:32:12,912 --> 05:32:13,546
MOST' PERSUASIVE QUESTIONERS I 

6887
05:32:13,546 --> 05:32:14,146
THINK IN THAT -- DEMOCRATS' 

6888
05:32:14,146 --> 05:32:14,647
MOST PERSUASIVE I THINK 

6889
05:32:14,647 --> 05:32:15,281
QUESTIONERS BUT A MORE CERTAIN 

6890
05:32:15,281 --> 05:32:15,714
CANDIDATE IN 2020. 

6891
05:32:15,714 --> 05:32:16,382
SO I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO 

6892
05:32:16,382 --> 05:32:16,949
THE KIND OF JOCKEYING FOR 

6893
05:32:16,949 --> 05:32:17,616
POSITION THAT JOEL WAS TALKING 

6894
05:32:17,616 --> 05:32:17,850
ABOUT. 

6895
05:32:17,850 --> 05:32:18,484
IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR 

6896
05:32:18,484 --> 05:32:19,018
OR ANY DEMOCRAT WHO HAS 

6897
05:32:19,018 --> 05:32:19,652
THOUGHTS OF RUNNING IN 2020, 

6898
05:32:19,652 --> 05:32:20,319
YOU CAN'T REALLY GET TOO FAR TO 

6899
05:32:20,319 --> 05:32:20,586
THE LEFT. 

6900
05:32:20,586 --> 05:32:21,220
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GET TOO 

6901
05:32:21,220 --> 05:32:21,854
ADAMANT IN YOUR OPPOSITION TO 

6902
05:32:21,854 --> 05:32:22,555
THIS GUY, SO IT WAS INTERESTING 

6903
05:32:22,555 --> 05:32:23,222
TO ME THAT HARRIS WAS LEADING 

6904
05:32:23,222 --> 05:32:23,856
THAT GROUP, WAS TAKING TO THE 

6905
05:32:23,856 --> 05:32:24,557
LEAD IN TALKING TO REPORTERS AT 

6906
05:32:24,557 --> 05:32:25,224
AN IMPROMPTU  NEWS CONFERENCE 

6907
05:32:25,224 --> 05:32:25,758
AFTERWARD, REALLY PUTTING 

6908
05:32:25,758 --> 05:32:26,292
HERSELF IN THE VAN GARD 

6909
05:32:26,292 --> 05:32:26,559
POSITION. 

6910
05:32:26,559 --> 05:32:27,226
>> WE ARE WATCHING THE SENATORS 

6911
05:32:27,226 --> 05:32:27,760
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

6912
05:32:27,760 --> 05:32:28,327
COMMITTEE, LINDSAY GRAHAM, 

6913
05:32:28,327 --> 05:32:28,794
ORRIN HATCH AS WELL. 

6914
05:32:28,794 --> 05:32:29,361
I BELIEVE I JUST SAW CHUCK 

6915
05:32:29,361 --> 05:32:29,995
GRASSLEY TAKING HIS SEAT ALONG 

6916
05:32:29,995 --> 05:32:30,496
WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 

6917
05:32:30,496 --> 05:32:31,163
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WHISPERING 

6918
05:32:31,163 --> 05:32:31,597
AND HOVERING OVER. 

6919
05:32:31,597 --> 05:32:31,997
CURIOUS TO KNOW. 

6920
05:32:31,997 --> 05:32:32,565
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE 

6921
05:32:32,565 --> 05:32:32,865
WHISPERING. 

6922
05:32:32,865 --> 05:32:33,465
LINDSAY GRAHAM IS CERTAINLY 

6923
05:32:33,465 --> 05:32:34,099
BEING PRAISED AMONG REPUBLICAN 

6924
05:32:34,099 --> 05:32:34,633
CIRCLES FOR STANDING UP. 

6925
05:32:34,633 --> 05:32:35,334
A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT JUDGE 

6926
05:32:35,334 --> 05:32:35,935
KAVANAUGH WAS WRONGLY ACCUSED 

6927
05:32:35,935 --> 05:32:36,635
AND HE IS VERY MUCH RIDING THE 

6928
05:32:36,635 --> 05:32:37,202
COURSE BECAUSE THIS IS SO 

6929
05:32:37,202 --> 05:32:37,870
POLITICIZED, AND IT'S PART OF 

6930
05:32:37,870 --> 05:32:38,504
THESE DEMOCRAT SHANNON BEGANS 

6931
05:32:38,504 --> 05:32:39,138
AND A SMEAR CAMPAIGN WHICH IS 

6932
05:32:39,138 --> 05:32:39,805
ALL TALKING POINTS OF THE TRUMP 

6933
05:32:39,805 --> 05:32:40,172
ADMINISTRATION. 

6934
05:32:40,172 --> 05:32:40,773
BUT THE CAUTION I WOULD GIVE, 

6935
05:32:40,773 --> 05:32:41,440
AGAIN, SAYING THERE'S TWO SIDES 

6936
05:32:41,440 --> 05:32:42,074
TO THIS IS LOOK AT THE OTHER 

6937
05:32:42,074 --> 05:32:42,675
OUTSIDE INSTITUTIONS, WHETHER 

6938
05:32:42,675 --> 05:32:43,342
IT BE HARVARD UNIVERSITY, YALE, 

6939
05:32:43,342 --> 05:32:43,976
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, 

6940
05:32:43,976 --> 05:32:44,643
THEY'RE SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD 

6941
05:32:44,643 --> 05:32:45,110
TAKE A SECOND HERE. 

6942
05:32:45,110 --> 05:32:45,744
AND THE REASON I SAY WE POINT 

6943
05:32:45,744 --> 05:32:46,378
TO THAT, REPUBLICANS COULD SAY 

6944
05:32:46,378 --> 05:32:47,046
IT'S THE IVORY TOWER, IT'S THE 

6945
05:32:47,046 --> 05:32:47,613
ELITE INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE 

6946
05:32:47,613 --> 05:32:48,247
REALLY BEING CRITICAL OF JUDGE 

6947
05:32:48,247 --> 05:32:48,847
KAVANAUGH, BUT I THINK IT'S 

6948
05:32:48,847 --> 05:32:49,248
ABOUT THE MONEY. 

6949
05:32:49,248 --> 05:32:49,848
IT'S ABOUT THE TRUSTEES, THE 

6950
05:32:49,848 --> 05:32:50,516
DONORS, THE PEOPLE THAT ATTEND 

6951
05:32:50,516 --> 05:32:51,083
THESE UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE 

6952
05:32:51,083 --> 05:32:51,750
SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE, THERE IS 

6953
05:32:51,750 --> 05:32:52,418
SOMETHING HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE 

6954
05:32:52,418 --> 05:32:53,052
EVALUATED, WE HAD NEED -- WE 

6955
05:32:53,052 --> 05:32:53,719
NEED TO TAKE A SECOND MORE, AND 

6956
05:32:53,719 --> 05:32:54,219
BECAUSE SUCH POWERFUL 

6957
05:32:54,219 --> 05:32:54,853
INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING THAT I 

6958
05:32:54,853 --> 05:32:55,487
THINK IT WILL HAVE A RIPPLE 

6959
05:32:55,487 --> 05:32:56,121
EFFECT, NOT NECESSARILY DENYING 

6960
05:32:56,121 --> 05:32:56,722
THE CONFIRMATION TO SUPREME 

6961
05:32:56,722 --> 05:32:57,389
COURT, BUT WILL HAVE A RIPPLE 

6962
05:32:57,389 --> 05:32:58,090
EFFECT IN HOW WE LOOK AT THIS 

6963
05:32:58,090 --> 05:32:58,791
PROCESS, WHETHER WE ARE SEEN AS 

6964
05:32:58,791 --> 05:32:59,358
AN EGREGIOUS EFFORT TO HAVE 

6965
05:32:59,358 --> 05:32:59,992
THIS CLOUD OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 

6966
05:32:59,992 --> 05:33:00,526
POTENTIALLY OUT THERE AND 

6967
05:33:00,526 --> 05:33:01,126
REALLY WHAT THE STANDARD IS 

6968
05:33:01,126 --> 05:33:01,727
GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE. 

6969
05:33:01,727 --> 05:33:02,394
WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GO BACK 

6970
05:33:02,394 --> 05:33:02,995
TO WHERE WE ARE BEFORE THE 

6971
05:33:02,995 --> 05:33:03,429
KAVANAUGH HEARING. 

6972
05:33:03,429 --> 05:33:04,129
>> THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT 

6973
05:33:04,129 --> 05:33:04,763
WE HAVEN'T UNPACKED MUCH, BUT 

6974
05:33:04,763 --> 05:33:05,364
IT IS JUST A VERY SERIOUS 

6975
05:33:05,364 --> 05:33:05,931
SITUATION WITH THE SUPREME 

6976
05:33:05,931 --> 05:33:06,498
COURT WHETHER YOU LOOK AT 

6977
05:33:06,498 --> 05:33:07,166
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO GET THROUGH 

6978
05:33:07,166 --> 05:33:07,833
MERRICK GARLAND, YOU LOOK RIGHT 

6979
05:33:07,833 --> 05:33:08,434
NOW WITH KAVANAUGH, HAS THE 

6980
05:33:08,434 --> 05:33:09,068
LITMUS TEST OF HOW YOU PROCEED 

6981
05:33:09,068 --> 05:33:09,702
FORWARD IN GETTING SOMEONE ON 

6982
05:33:09,702 --> 05:33:10,369
THE SUPREME COURT, IS IT JUST 

6983
05:33:10,369 --> 05:33:10,970
PARTISAN AND THAT'S IT AND 

6984
05:33:10,970 --> 05:33:11,503
WE'VE JUST ACCEPTED IT? 

6985
05:33:11,503 --> 05:33:12,171
>> SO I ACTUALLY THINK -- YOU 

6986
05:33:12,171 --> 05:33:12,805
KNOW, WE WERE TALKING EARLIER 

6987
05:33:12,805 --> 05:33:13,305
ABOUT THE COURT AS AN 

6988
05:33:13,305 --> 05:33:13,839
ORGANIZING ISSUE FOR THE 

6989
05:33:13,839 --> 05:33:14,406
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. 

6990
05:33:14,406 --> 05:33:15,007
HISTORICALLY DEMOCRATS REALLY 

6991
05:33:15,007 --> 05:33:15,641
HAVE NOT ORGANIZED AROUND THE 

6992
05:33:15,641 --> 05:33:16,175
COURT, REPUBLICANS HAVE. 

6993
05:33:16,175 --> 05:33:16,742
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT'S WHY 

6994
05:33:16,742 --> 05:33:17,343
THEY'VE PACKED THE COURT SO 

6995
05:33:17,343 --> 05:33:17,943
SUCCESSFULLY IN THE LAST, YOU 

6996
05:33:17,943 --> 05:33:18,577
KNOW, TWO DECADES, EVEN AT THE 

6997
05:33:18,577 --> 05:33:18,911
LOWER LEVELS. 

6998
05:33:18,911 --> 05:33:19,578
BUT NOW THIS IS EMERGING AS A 

6999
05:33:19,578 --> 05:33:20,179
LEADING ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS, 

7000
05:33:20,179 --> 05:33:20,879
AND THIS IS THE ULTIMATE LITMUS 

7001
05:33:20,879 --> 05:33:21,213
TEST, RIGHT? 

7002
05:33:21,213 --> 05:33:21,847
BECAUSE THIS IS THE CLEAREST 

7003
05:33:21,847 --> 05:33:22,448
EXAMPLE OF YOU SHOWING YOUR 

7004
05:33:22,448 --> 05:33:23,048
PUSHBACK TO DONALD TRUMP IS 

7005
05:33:23,048 --> 05:33:23,549
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN 

7006
05:33:23,549 --> 05:33:24,183
EFFECTIVELY ARTICULATE A CASE 

7007
05:33:24,183 --> 05:33:24,783
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH AND, 

7008
05:33:24,783 --> 05:33:25,417
AGAIN, IT'S A 20/20 TEST THAT 

7009
05:33:25,417 --> 05:33:26,085
IS VERY, VERY SERIOUS, AND, BY 

7010
05:33:26,085 --> 05:33:26,719
THE WAY, IT'S NOT JUST THESE 

7011
05:33:26,719 --> 05:33:27,252
FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE. 

7012
05:33:27,252 --> 05:33:27,886
IT'S GOVERNORS, IT'S GOING TO 

7013
05:33:27,886 --> 05:33:28,554
BE HOUSE CANDIDATES, IT'S GOING 

7014
05:33:28,554 --> 05:33:29,254
TO BE PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN 

7015
05:33:29,254 --> 05:33:29,888
PARTY WHO ARE RUNNING AGAINST. 

7016
05:33:29,888 --> 05:33:30,589
THIS IS SETTING UP TO BE A REAL 

7017
05:33:30,589 --> 05:33:31,156
ORGANIZING ISSUE FOR BOTH 

7018
05:33:31,156 --> 05:33:31,390
SIDES. 

7019
05:33:31,390 --> 05:33:32,057
>> AND BECAUSE IT IS A LASTING 

7020
05:33:32,057 --> 05:33:32,725
LEGACY OF THE PRESIDENT, UNLIKE 

7021
05:33:32,725 --> 05:33:33,392
A POLICY OR A LAW THAT CAN BE 

7022
05:33:33,392 --> 05:33:33,926
UNRAVELED OR REPEALED AS 

7023
05:33:33,926 --> 05:33:34,593
DIFFICULT AS THAT HAS PROVEN TO 

7024
05:33:34,593 --> 05:33:35,227
BE, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO 

7025
05:33:35,227 --> 05:33:35,828
IMPEACH OR RESCIND A SUPREME 

7026
05:33:35,828 --> 05:33:36,428
COURT JUSTICE, THAT'S VERY 

7027
05:33:36,428 --> 05:33:36,829
DIFFICULT TO DO. 

7028
05:33:36,829 --> 05:33:37,363
THIS IS A GENERATIONAL 

7029
05:33:37,363 --> 05:33:37,896
APPOINTMENT WHICH IS WHY 

7030
05:33:37,896 --> 05:33:38,464
ESPECIALLY FOR THIS SEAT 

7031
05:33:38,464 --> 05:33:39,064
BECAUSE IT WILL CHANGE THE 

7032
05:33:39,064 --> 05:33:39,665
MAKEUP OF THE COURT FROM A 

7033
05:33:39,665 --> 05:33:40,332
CONSERVATIVE STANDPOINT, THAT'S 

7034
05:33:40,332 --> 05:33:41,033
WHY THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL FOR 

7035
05:33:41,033 --> 05:33:41,667
PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S 

7036
05:33:41,667 --> 05:33:42,334
SUCH AN ENERGY AND, YOU KNOW, 

7037
05:33:42,334 --> 05:33:42,868
ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS. 

7038
05:33:42,868 --> 05:33:43,569
>> WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE, WE HAVE 

7039
05:33:43,569 --> 05:33:44,269
A REPORTING THAT GEORGE W. BUSH 

7040
05:33:44,269 --> 05:33:44,870
HAVE CALLED CERTAIN SENATORS 

7041
05:33:44,870 --> 05:33:45,537
THAT ARE ON THE FENCE SAYING I 

7042
05:33:45,537 --> 05:33:46,171
KNOW THAT KAVANAUGH WORKED VERY 

7043
05:33:46,171 --> 05:33:46,805
CLOSELY WITH BUSH, YOU SHOULD 

7044
05:33:46,805 --> 05:33:47,373
VOTE, THIS IS IMPORTANT. 

7045
05:33:47,373 --> 05:33:48,007
>> AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE WAY 

7046
05:33:48,007 --> 05:33:48,574
IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT 

7047
05:33:48,574 --> 05:33:49,208
FIGHT HAS GALVANIZED EVERYONE 

7048
05:33:49,208 --> 05:33:49,875
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HAS 

7049
05:33:49,875 --> 05:33:50,509
BEEN KIND OF THE GLUE THAT 

7050
05:33:50,509 --> 05:33:51,010
KEEPS IT ALL TOGETHER. 

7051
05:33:51,010 --> 05:33:51,644
REMEMBER THERE WERE A LOT OF 

7052
05:33:51,644 --> 05:33:52,277
CONSERVATIVES WHO WERE OPPOSED 

7053
05:33:52,277 --> 05:33:52,911
TO DONALD TRUMP FOR A VARIETY 

7054
05:33:52,911 --> 05:33:53,412
OF DIFFERENT REASONS. 

7055
05:33:53,412 --> 05:33:54,079
>> THE BUSH FAMILY AMONG THEM. 

7056
05:33:54,079 --> 05:33:54,747
>> THE BUSH FAMILY AMONG THEM, 

7057
05:33:54,747 --> 05:33:54,947
YES. 

7058
05:33:54,947 --> 05:33:55,581
AND THE COURT WAS THE ONE ISSUE 

7059
05:33:55,581 --> 05:33:56,181
THAT THEY KIND OF COALESCED 

7060
05:33:56,181 --> 05:33:56,782
AROUND AND EVANGELICALS AS 

7061
05:33:56,782 --> 05:33:56,982
WELL. 

7062
05:33:56,982 --> 05:33:57,516
THIS HAS BEEN A DRIVING 

7063
05:33:57,516 --> 05:33:58,183
PRINCIPLE FOR THEM, AND SO THIS 

7064
05:33:58,183 --> 05:33:58,817
IS WHAT IS KEEPS THE PARTY -- 

7065
05:33:58,817 --> 05:33:59,385
KEEPING THE PARTY TOGETHER. 

7066
05:33:59,385 --> 05:33:59,952
>> NIALL, WE KNOW SENATOR 

7067
05:33:59,952 --> 05:34:00,552
MURKOWSKI, SENATOR COLLINS, 

7068
05:34:00,552 --> 05:34:01,253
WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY, DO 

7069
05:34:01,253 --> 05:34:01,820
WE KNOW, DO THEY HAVE A 

7070
05:34:01,820 --> 05:34:02,421
RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 

7071
05:34:02,421 --> 05:34:02,655
TRUMP? 

7072
05:34:02,655 --> 05:34:03,288
>> DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE 

7073
05:34:03,288 --> 05:34:03,622
RELATIONSHIP. 

7074
05:34:03,622 --> 05:34:04,156
TES PRETTY TENSE THERE. 

7075
05:34:04,156 --> 05:34:04,757
-- IT'S PRETTY TENSE THERE. 

7076
05:34:04,757 --> 05:34:05,357
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TRIED TO 

7077
05:34:05,357 --> 05:34:05,958
KEEP THEM ON BOARD TO SOME 

7078
05:34:05,958 --> 05:34:06,558
EXTENT, HE CERTAINLY HAS NOT 

7079
05:34:06,558 --> 05:34:07,292
BEEN CRITICAL OF THEM AS HE DID 

7080
05:34:07,292 --> 05:34:07,860
THE BUSH FAMILY FOR THAT 

7081
05:34:07,860 --> 05:34:08,093
MATTER. 

7082
05:34:08,093 --> 05:34:08,727
BUT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE IN THE 

7083
05:34:08,727 --> 05:34:09,395
SENATE, THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO 

7084
05:34:09,395 --> 05:34:10,029
MAKE THESE DECISIONS TO SOME 

7085
05:34:10,029 --> 05:34:10,696
EXTENT ON THEIR OWN INTERESTS, 

7086
05:34:10,696 --> 05:34:11,330
AND SOMEONE LIKE SUSAN COLLINS 

7087
05:34:11,330 --> 05:34:11,897
WHO HAS CREATED A NICHE FOR 

7088
05:34:11,897 --> 05:34:12,498
HERSELF POLITICALLY AS THAT 

7089
05:34:12,498 --> 05:34:13,165
MODERATE, AS THAT PERSON WHO IS 

7090
05:34:13,165 --> 05:34:13,832
WILLING TO BUCK THE PARTY LINE, 

7091
05:34:13,832 --> 05:34:14,466
I'M NOT SURE HOW SHE IS GOING 

7092
05:34:14,466 --> 05:34:15,134
TO BE TO TIE HERSELF COMPLETELY 

7093
05:34:15,134 --> 05:34:15,567
TO DONALD TRUMP. 

7094
05:34:15,567 --> 05:34:16,235
A LITTLE BIT OF DISTANCE THERE 

7095
05:34:16,235 --> 05:34:16,935
IS PROBABLY BENEFICIAL FOR HER, 

7096
05:34:16,935 --> 05:34:17,469
AND JUST ONE OTHER POINT 

7097
05:34:17,469 --> 05:34:18,103
QUICKLY, REENA, THIS ALL THAT 

7098
05:34:18,103 --> 05:34:18,771
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO ME GETS 

7099
05:34:18,771 --> 05:34:19,471
TO THE FACT THAT THE COUNTRY IS 

7100
05:34:19,471 --> 05:34:20,172
SO POLARIZED AT THE MOMENT THAT 

7101
05:34:20,172 --> 05:34:20,839
THE SUPREME COURT HAD BEEN SORT 

7102
05:34:20,839 --> 05:34:21,507
OF THE LAST OF THE BASTION OF 

7103
05:34:21,507 --> 05:34:22,074
THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE CAN 

7104
05:34:22,074 --> 05:34:22,741
TRANSCEND PARTISAN LINES IF YOU 

7105
05:34:22,741 --> 05:34:23,409
WERE NOMINATED BY A DEMOCRATIC 

7106
05:34:23,409 --> 05:34:23,976
PRESIDENT OR A REPUBLICAN 

7107
05:34:23,976 --> 05:34:24,677
PRESIDENT, THAT DIDN'T MARK THE 

7108
05:34:24,677 --> 05:34:25,277
REST OF YOUR TENURE ON THE 

7109
05:34:25,277 --> 05:34:25,644
SUPREME COURT. 

7110
05:34:25,644 --> 05:34:26,311
NOW I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO 

7111
05:34:26,311 --> 05:34:26,912
A POINT WHERE BOTH POLITICAL 

7112
05:34:26,912 --> 05:34:27,479
PARTIES SIMPLY SEE SUPREME 

7113
05:34:27,479 --> 05:34:28,080
COURT SEATS AS PART OF THE 

7114
05:34:28,080 --> 05:34:28,681
SPOILS OF THE ELECTION WINS. 

7115
05:34:28,681 --> 05:34:29,348
THAT'S A BIT OF A SHAME, BUT I 

7116
05:34:29,348 --> 05:34:29,848
THINK IT'S INEVITABLE. 

7117
05:34:29,848 --> 05:34:30,282
>> I'M SO SORRY. 

7118
05:34:30,282 --> 05:34:30,983
BUT ON HIS POINT, SO THE VENEER 

7119
05:34:30,983 --> 05:34:31,483
IS OFF ON KAVANAUGH. 

7120
05:34:31,483 --> 05:34:32,151
IT USED TO BE THIS IDEA, YES, 

7121
05:34:32,151 --> 05:34:32,818
HE'S A CONSERVATIVE JURIST, BUT 

7122
05:34:32,818 --> 05:34:33,385
HE WOULD BE IMPARTIAL AND 

7123
05:34:33,385 --> 05:34:33,652
UNBIASED. 

7124
05:34:33,652 --> 05:34:34,219
IT WAS A POLITICAL SPEECH 

7125
05:34:34,219 --> 05:34:34,753
TESTIMONY THAT HE GAVE 

7126
05:34:34,753 --> 05:34:35,287
YESTERDAY WHICH FOR EVEN 

7127
05:34:35,287 --> 05:34:35,821
CONSERVATIVES, ECONOMIC 

7128
05:34:35,821 --> 05:34:36,455
CONSERVATIVES WERE, LIKE, WOW, 

7129
05:34:36,455 --> 05:34:37,156
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE 

7130
05:34:37,156 --> 05:34:37,723
COME FROM A JUDGE, AND WE 

7131
05:34:37,723 --> 05:34:38,290
REALIZE HE'S DEFENDING HIS 

7132
05:34:38,290 --> 05:34:38,891
INTEGRITY, HE IS THE ACCUSED 

7133
05:34:38,891 --> 05:34:39,491
VERSUS BEING THE JUDGE, BUT 

7134
05:34:39,491 --> 05:34:40,092
THERE WAS A LINE HE CROSSED 

7135
05:34:40,092 --> 05:34:40,793
THAT WAS SO PARTISAN IT MADE A 

7136
05:34:40,793 --> 05:34:41,293
LOT OF PEOPLE PAUSE. 

7137
05:34:41,293 --> 05:34:41,894
AND TO CAITLIN'S POINT ABOUT 

7138
05:34:41,894 --> 05:34:42,494
THE EVANGELICALS, THE REASON 

7139
05:34:42,494 --> 05:34:42,995
THE GLUE WAS THERE WAS 

7140
05:34:42,995 --> 05:34:43,629
PROTECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS, 

7141
05:34:43,629 --> 05:34:44,229
DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD 

7142
05:34:44,229 --> 05:34:44,763
WHICH THE PRESIDENT GAVE. 

7143
05:34:44,763 --> 05:34:45,431
THEY'RE WILLING TO BE BLIND FOR 

7144
05:34:45,431 --> 05:34:46,065
EVERYTHING ELSE TO HAVE THOSE 

7145
05:34:46,065 --> 05:34:46,665
PROTECTIONS YOU HAVE SOLELY 

7146
05:34:46,665 --> 05:34:47,232
THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT. 

7147
05:34:47,232 --> 05:34:47,866
SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO -- 

7148
05:34:47,866 --> 05:34:48,534
>> I KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE A 

7149
05:34:48,534 --> 05:34:49,234
POINT, BUT I JUST WANT TO TAKE 

7150
05:34:49,234 --> 05:34:49,902
YOU LIVE HERE FOR ONE SECOND TO 

7151
05:34:49,902 --> 05:34:50,436
GIVE YOU AN IMAGE HERE. 

7152
05:34:50,436 --> 05:34:51,036
THIS IS THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

7153
05:34:51,036 --> 05:34:51,336
COMMITTEE. 

7154
05:34:51,336 --> 05:34:52,004
IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY, LOOK 

7155
05:34:52,004 --> 05:34:52,404
AT THOSE CHAIRS. 

7156
05:34:52,404 --> 05:34:53,072
A LOT OF SENATORS NOT IN THOSE 

7157
05:34:53,072 --> 05:34:53,305
CHAIRS. 

7158
05:34:53,305 --> 05:34:53,939
WE'RE HEARING FROM ED O'KEEFE 

7159
05:34:53,939 --> 05:34:54,540
ALL DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF THE 

7160
05:34:54,540 --> 05:34:55,207
HEARING ROOM AND A GOOD PORTION 

7161
05:34:55,207 --> 05:34:55,874
OF THE DEMOCRATIC STAFF, THOSE 

7162
05:34:55,874 --> 05:34:56,508
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO USUALLY SIT 

7163
05:34:56,508 --> 05:34:57,176
BEHIND THE SENATORS, THEY JUST 

7164
05:34:57,176 --> 05:34:57,710
EXITED THE HEARING ROOM. 

7165
05:34:57,710 --> 05:34:58,177
IT'S NOW 1:38 P.M. 

7166
05:34:58,177 --> 05:34:58,844
EASTERN, EIGHT MINUTES AGO THEY 

7167
05:34:58,844 --> 05:34:59,445
WERE SUPPOSED TO HOLD THIS 

7168
05:34:59,445 --> 05:34:59,645
VOTE. 

7169
05:34:59,645 --> 05:35:00,245
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE 

7170
05:35:00,245 --> 05:35:00,913
DEMOCRATS TO SHOW UP AND AS OUR 

7171
05:35:00,913 --> 05:35:01,580
ED O'KEEFE IS REPORTING, THEY 

7172
05:35:01,580 --> 05:35:02,214
DID NOT SHOW UP, AND THEIR OWN 

7173
05:35:02,214 --> 05:35:02,781
STAFFERS, THEIR DEMOCRATIC 

7174
05:35:02,781 --> 05:35:03,415
STAFFERS HAVE ACTUALLY EXITED 

7175
05:35:03,415 --> 05:35:03,682
THE ROOM. 

7176
05:35:03,682 --> 05:35:04,216
JOEL, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE? 

7177
05:35:04,216 --> 05:35:04,917
>> SO I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT 

7178
05:35:04,917 --> 05:35:05,350
MATH FOR A SECOND. 

7179
05:35:05,350 --> 05:35:05,718
>> MATZ, OKAY. 

7180
05:35:05,718 --> 05:35:06,318
>> NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITE 

7181
05:35:06,318 --> 05:35:06,552
TOPICS. 

7182
05:35:06,552 --> 05:35:07,119
LOOK, YOU DON'T GET TO BE 

7183
05:35:07,119 --> 05:35:07,753
MAJORITY LEADER UNLESS YOU CAN 

7184
05:35:07,753 --> 05:35:08,087
COUNT VOTES. 

7185
05:35:08,087 --> 05:35:08,554
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. 

7186
05:35:08,554 --> 05:35:09,121
SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS, 

7187
05:35:09,121 --> 05:35:09,321
OKAY? 

7188
05:35:09,321 --> 05:35:09,655
51-49, OKAY. 

7189
05:35:09,655 --> 05:35:10,289
SO REPUBLICANS CAN ESSENTIALLY 

7190
05:35:10,289 --> 05:35:10,889
AFFORD TO LOSE TWO IF THEY 

7191
05:35:10,889 --> 05:35:11,557
REPLACE THEM WITH ONE DEMOCRAT 

7192
05:35:11,557 --> 05:35:12,224
OR THEY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ONE 

7193
05:35:12,224 --> 05:35:12,725
AND THEN PENCE IS THE 

7194
05:35:12,725 --> 05:35:13,025
TIEBREAKER. 

7195
05:35:13,025 --> 05:35:13,659
SO YOU COULD POTENTIALLY SEE A 

7196
05:35:13,659 --> 05:35:14,293
SCENARIO HERE WHERE REPUBLICANS 

7197
05:35:14,293 --> 05:35:14,893
LOSE A MURKOWSKI, OKAY, BUT 

7198
05:35:14,893 --> 05:35:15,527
THEY REPLACE A MURKOWSKI WITH 

7199
05:35:15,527 --> 05:35:16,195
LIKE A MANCHIN OR A HEITKAMP, I 

7200
05:35:16,195 --> 05:35:16,862
THINK THAT'S FASCINATING, AND I 

7201
05:35:16,862 --> 05:35:17,563
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY 

7202
05:35:17,563 --> 05:35:18,130
INTERESTING DYNAMICS FOR A 

7203
05:35:18,130 --> 05:35:18,630
DEMOCRAT LIKE THAT WHO 

7204
05:35:18,630 --> 05:35:19,264
ESSENTIALLY GIVES DONALD TRUMP 

7205
05:35:19,264 --> 05:35:19,898
HIS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHEN 

7206
05:35:19,898 --> 05:35:20,499
HE COULDN'T EVEN KEEP HIS 

7207
05:35:20,499 --> 05:35:20,999
ENTIRE PARTY IN LINE. 

7208
05:35:20,999 --> 05:35:21,533
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY 

7209
05:35:21,533 --> 05:35:22,134
FASCINATING PHENOMENON THAT 

7210
05:35:22,134 --> 05:35:22,768
COULD EMERGE THIS AFTERNOON. 

7211
05:35:22,768 --> 05:35:23,302
AND WHILE JOE MANCHIN IS 

7212
05:35:23,302 --> 05:35:23,869
PROBABLY BULLET-PROOF IN A 

7213
05:35:23,869 --> 05:35:24,403
PLACE LIKE WEST VIRGINIA 

7214
05:35:24,403 --> 05:35:25,070
BECAUSE NO ONE IS GOING TO RUN 

7215
05:35:25,070 --> 05:35:25,738
TO THE LEFT OF HIM THERE, OR 

7216
05:35:25,738 --> 05:35:26,305
HIDIEST HEITKAMP IN NORTH 

7217
05:35:26,305 --> 05:35:26,905
DAKOTA, THE RAGE -- OR HEIDI 

7218
05:35:26,905 --> 05:35:27,539
HEITKAMP IN NORTH DAKOTA, THE 

7219
05:35:27,539 --> 05:35:28,173
RAGE, THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF 

7220
05:35:28,173 --> 05:35:28,774
THE PARTY, IF THAT WERE TO 

7221
05:35:28,774 --> 05:35:29,441
HAPPEN I THINK WOULD BE REALLY 

7222
05:35:29,441 --> 05:35:29,975
FASCINATING TO WATCH AND 

7223
05:35:29,975 --> 05:35:30,242
OBSERVE. 

7224
05:35:30,242 --> 05:35:30,843
>> DOES ANYBODY KNOW IF THE 

7225
05:35:30,843 --> 05:35:31,543
DEMOCRATS DON'T SHOW UP AT THIS 

7226
05:35:31,543 --> 05:35:32,177
POINT, DO THEY STILL HOLD THE 

7227
05:35:32,177 --> 05:35:32,377
VOTE? 

7228
05:35:32,377 --> 05:35:32,978
>> I BELIEVE THAT THEY DO. 

7229
05:35:32,978 --> 05:35:33,612
VIEWERS CAN THEN CALL IN AND 

7230
05:35:33,612 --> 05:35:34,146
COMPLAIN HOW WRONG I AM. 

7231
05:35:34,146 --> 05:35:34,780
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S CONSIDERED 

7232
05:35:34,780 --> 05:35:35,481
AN ABSENTIAN IF THEY DON'T SHOW 

7233
05:35:35,481 --> 05:35:35,647
UP. 

7234
05:35:35,647 --> 05:35:36,181
THIS IMAGE THAT IS BEING 

7235
05:35:36,181 --> 05:35:36,782
BROADCAST INTERNATIONALLY AT 

7236
05:35:36,782 --> 05:35:37,449
THIS POINT STREAMING LIVE THAT 

7237
05:35:37,449 --> 05:35:38,083
DEMOCRATS CHOSE NOT TO ATTEND 

7238
05:35:38,083 --> 05:35:38,350
AT 1:30. 

7239
05:35:38,350 --> 05:35:38,951
WE KNOW -- JOEL, YOU WERE 

7240
05:35:38,951 --> 05:35:39,618
TALKING TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE 

7241
05:35:39,618 --> 05:35:39,818
MATH. 

7242
05:35:39,818 --> 05:35:40,519
WE KNOW AT THIS POINT THAT THE 

7243
05:35:40,519 --> 05:35:41,086
REPUBLICANS, THEY HAVE THE 

7244
05:35:41,086 --> 05:35:41,687
MAJORITY, WE DON'T KNOW, DO 

7245
05:35:41,687 --> 05:35:42,187
THEY HAVE THE VOTES? 

7246
05:35:42,187 --> 05:35:42,755
WE'RE STILL WAITING TO SEE 

7247
05:35:42,755 --> 05:35:43,422
EXACTLY HOW FOLKS ARE VOTING ON 

7248
05:35:43,422 --> 05:35:44,056
KAVANAUGH, BUT WHAT MORE CAN 

7249
05:35:44,056 --> 05:35:44,723
THE DEMOCRATS REALLY DO AT THIS 

7250
05:35:44,723 --> 05:35:44,957
POINT? 

7251
05:35:44,957 --> 05:35:45,557
>> WELL, I THINK THIS IMAGE 

7252
05:35:45,557 --> 05:35:46,058
SPEAKS TO IT, RIGHT? 

7253
05:35:46,058 --> 05:35:46,692
THEY DON'T HAVE THE VOTES TO 

7254
05:35:46,692 --> 05:35:47,326
OVERTAKE THE MAJORITY IN THE 

7255
05:35:47,326 --> 05:35:47,960
SENATE, BUT THEY CAN DO A LOT 

7256
05:35:47,960 --> 05:35:48,594
TO CREATE VISUALS, TO CREATE 

7257
05:35:48,594 --> 05:35:49,228
SOME MOMENTUM TO CREATE EVEN 

7258
05:35:49,228 --> 05:35:49,895
MORE ENERGY TO APPLY EVEN MORE 

7259
05:35:49,895 --> 05:35:50,496
PRESSURE HAVING THIS IMAGE, 

7260
05:35:50,496 --> 05:35:51,130
REFUSING TO BE PART OF THIS, 

7261
05:35:51,130 --> 05:35:51,797
DELAYING THE VOTE AS MUCH AS 

7262
05:35:51,797 --> 05:35:52,464
THEY CAN TO ALLOW FOR, AGAIN, 

7263
05:35:52,464 --> 05:35:53,165
THE PUBLIC TO KEEP REACTING TO 

7264
05:35:53,165 --> 05:35:53,599
THIS IN REAL TIME. 

7265
05:35:53,599 --> 05:35:54,233
I THINK THESE ARE THE KINDS OF 

7266
05:35:54,233 --> 05:35:54,867
MANEUVERS THAT THEY CAN DO TO 

7267
05:35:54,867 --> 05:35:55,434
DO THIS AND REPUBLICANS ARE 

7268
05:35:55,434 --> 05:35:56,034
GOING TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS 

7269
05:35:56,034 --> 05:35:56,568
POLITICAL ON THEIR PART. 

7270
05:35:56,568 --> 05:35:57,269
>> JUST BRIEFLY, THOSE PICTURES 

7271
05:35:57,269 --> 05:35:57,903
THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT JUST 

7272
05:35:57,903 --> 05:35:58,570
NOW, I MEAN, THOSE ARE GOING TO 

7273
05:35:58,570 --> 05:35:59,071
BE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF 

7274
05:35:59,071 --> 05:35:59,371
NEWSPAPERS. 

7275
05:35:59,371 --> 05:36:00,005
THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE ALL 

7276
05:36:00,005 --> 05:36:00,639
THROUGH PEOPLE'S SOCIAL MEDIA 

7277
05:36:00,639 --> 05:36:01,306
FEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE LAST -- 

7278
05:36:01,306 --> 05:36:01,974
OR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, GETTING 

7279
05:36:01,974 --> 05:36:02,574
TO THE POINT THAT WE WERE 

7280
05:36:02,574 --> 05:36:03,142
TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE 

7281
05:36:03,142 --> 05:36:03,742
DEGREE TO WHICH THIS HOUSE 

7282
05:36:03,742 --> 05:36:04,376
BECOMES SO POLARIZED, THE MAN 

7283
05:36:04,376 --> 05:36:05,010
MAY BE CONFIRMED TOTHE SUPREME 

7284
05:36:05,010 --> 05:36:05,644
COURT AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE 

7285
05:36:05,644 --> 05:36:06,311
THAT IMAGE AROUND HIM FROM THE 

7286
05:36:06,311 --> 05:36:06,545
OUTSET. 

7287
05:36:06,545 --> 05:36:07,179
>> TALK ABOUT PICTURES, THOUGH, 

7288
05:36:07,179 --> 05:36:07,746
AND I TALKED ABOUT OPTICS 

7289
05:36:07,746 --> 05:36:08,147
YESTERDAY, OKAY? 

7290
05:36:08,147 --> 05:36:08,847
THERE WERE SOME OPTICS THAT WE 

7291
05:36:08,847 --> 05:36:09,181
DIDN'T TALK. 

7292
05:36:09,181 --> 05:36:09,782
THERE'S AN IMAGE OF LINDSAY 

7293
05:36:09,782 --> 05:36:10,315
GRAHAM AND/ORIN HATCH AND 

7294
05:36:10,315 --> 05:36:10,883
OTHERS LAUGHING DURING THE 

7295
05:36:10,883 --> 05:36:11,450
MIDDLE OF THE PROCEEDINGS 

7296
05:36:11,450 --> 05:36:12,084
YESTERDAY WHICH WERE KIND OF 

7297
05:36:12,084 --> 05:36:12,651
CAUGHT FIRE, PARTICULARLY 

7298
05:36:12,651 --> 05:36:13,318
AROUND PROGRESSIVE TWITTER AS I 

7299
05:36:13,318 --> 05:36:13,719
LIKE TO CALL IT. 

7300
05:36:13,719 --> 05:36:14,353
THERE'S THESE IMAGES OF BRETT 

7301
05:36:14,353 --> 05:36:15,020
KAVANAUGH WHILE HE IS DEFENDING 

7302
05:36:15,020 --> 05:36:15,687
HIMSELF VERY ANG RILE DEFENDING 

7303
05:36:15,687 --> 05:36:16,288
HIMSELF, SOME VERY POWERFUL 

7304
05:36:16,288 --> 05:36:16,522
SHOTS. 

7305
05:36:16,522 --> 05:36:17,122
I THINK THIS IS ALSO ABOUT 

7306
05:36:17,122 --> 05:36:17,689
OPTICS A LOT OF THIS, THE 

7307
05:36:17,689 --> 05:36:18,357
OPTICS THAT YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING 

7308
05:36:18,357 --> 05:36:18,991
HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM, BUT 

7309
05:36:18,991 --> 05:36:19,658
ALSO ALL THOSE, YOU KNOW, WHITE 

7310
05:36:19,658 --> 05:36:20,259
MEN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 

7311
05:36:20,259 --> 05:36:20,826
WHO OPTED TO GIVE RACHEL 

7312
05:36:20,826 --> 05:36:21,460
MITCHELL THE GAVEL ESSENTIALLY 

7313
05:36:21,460 --> 05:36:22,027
YESTERDAY TO LEAD ON THEIR 

7314
05:36:22,027 --> 05:36:22,227
SIDE. 

7315
05:36:22,227 --> 05:36:22,828
THERE ARE SO MANY IMAGE, HOW 

7316
05:36:22,828 --> 05:36:23,462
ARE AMERICANS GOING TO PROCESS 

7317
05:36:23,462 --> 05:36:24,096
THIS, HOW ARE VOTERS GOING TO 

7318
05:36:24,096 --> 05:36:24,730
PROCESS THIS WHEN THEY GO TO 

7319
05:36:24,730 --> 05:36:25,264
THE POLLS IN TWO MONTH? 

7320
05:36:25,264 --> 05:36:25,864
>> AND TAKE THE GAVEL BACK. 

7321
05:36:25,864 --> 05:36:26,532
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS IMAGE. 

7322
05:36:26,532 --> 05:36:27,166
THIS WAS THE IMAGE -- I DON'T 

7323
05:36:27,166 --> 05:36:27,833
KNOW HOW CLOSE I CAN GET, THIS 

7324
05:36:27,833 --> 05:36:28,433
IS THE IMAGE IN "NEW YORK 

7325
05:36:28,433 --> 05:36:28,767
TIMES" TODAY. 

7326
05:36:28,767 --> 05:36:29,401
I'M CURIOUS WHAT THE HEADLINE 

7327
05:36:29,401 --> 05:36:30,035
FOR TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPER WILL 

7328
05:36:30,035 --> 05:36:30,669
BE NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO 

7329
05:36:30,669 --> 05:36:31,336
HAVE THIS VOTE AND AS WE KNOW 

7330
05:36:31,336 --> 05:36:31,937
SENATOR McCONNELL HAS WEIGHED 

7331
05:36:31,937 --> 05:36:32,604
IN SAYING IT'S STILL GOING TO 

7332
05:36:32,604 --> 05:36:33,138
GO TO THE SENATE FLOOR. 

7333
05:36:33,138 --> 05:36:33,438
>> WELL -- 

7334
05:36:33,438 --> 05:36:34,139
>> THIS IS AGAIN -- YOU WIN THE 

7335
05:36:34,139 --> 05:36:34,773
BATTLE, MAYBE PERHAPS LOSE THE 

7336
05:36:34,773 --> 05:36:34,973
WAR. 

7337
05:36:34,973 --> 05:36:35,574
THE BATTLE IS THEY MUST GET 

7338
05:36:35,574 --> 05:36:36,241
THIS CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT 

7339
05:36:36,241 --> 05:36:36,675
JUSTICE CONFIRMED. 

7340
05:36:36,675 --> 05:36:37,309
THAT'S THE GOAL LYING BEFORE 

7341
05:36:37,309 --> 05:36:37,776
THE MIDTERM ELECTION. 

7342
05:36:37,776 --> 05:36:38,477
AND EVERYTHING ELSE PEOPLE HAVE 

7343
05:36:38,477 --> 05:36:39,077
RATIONALIZED IT'S A CASE OF 

7344
05:36:39,077 --> 05:36:39,645
MISTAKEN IDENTITY AND HE'S 

7345
05:36:39,645 --> 05:36:40,245
STILL A VERY STRONG JURIST. 

7346
05:36:40,245 --> 05:36:40,846
>> I JUST WANT TO WEIGH IN 

7347
05:36:40,846 --> 05:36:41,046
HERE. 

7348
05:36:41,046 --> 05:36:41,713
WE'RE GETTING SOME REPORTING, I 

7349
05:36:41,713 --> 05:36:42,381
BELIEVE THIS IS FROM OUR NANCY 

7350
05:36:42,381 --> 05:36:43,048
CORDES WHO'S SAYING THAT FLAKE 

7351
05:36:43,048 --> 05:36:43,582
HAS NOT APPEARED IN THIS 

7352
05:36:43,582 --> 05:36:44,149
HEARING ROOM, IS ONE OF THE 

7353
05:36:44,149 --> 05:36:44,783
PEOPLE MISSING, AS YOU CAN SEE 

7354
05:36:44,783 --> 05:36:45,384
WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND HERE. 

7355
05:36:45,384 --> 05:36:46,084
GRAHAM IS NOW GOING BACK TO AN 

7356
05:36:46,084 --> 05:36:46,451
ADJACENT ROOM. 

7357
05:36:46,451 --> 05:36:47,019
THE ONLY SENATORS THAT ARE 

7358
05:36:47,019 --> 05:36:47,686
CURRENTLY IN THIS HEARING ROOM, 

7359
05:36:47,686 --> 05:36:48,353
AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, I 

7360
05:36:48,353 --> 05:36:48,921
CAN'T SEE FULLY HERE, I SEE 

7361
05:36:48,921 --> 05:36:49,588
IT'S KENNEDY, HATCH, GRASSLEY, 

7362
05:36:49,588 --> 05:36:50,189
GRAHAM IS ACTUALLY IN THAT 

7363
05:36:50,189 --> 05:36:50,756
ROOM, SO KENNEDY, HATCH, 

7364
05:36:50,756 --> 05:36:51,390
GRASSLEY AND GRAHAM THE ONLY 

7365
05:36:51,390 --> 05:36:51,990
ONES IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW. 

7366
05:36:51,990 --> 05:36:52,658
>> IT'S SO STRANGE AND PEOPLE 

7367
05:36:52,658 --> 05:36:53,292
KEEP SAYING, OH, THIS STUFF, 

7368
05:36:53,292 --> 05:36:53,892
THE DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING FOR 

7369
05:36:53,892 --> 05:36:54,193
THIS F.B.I. 

7370
05:36:54,193 --> 05:36:54,793
INQUIRY AND THE WHOLE PROCESS 

7371
05:36:54,793 --> 05:36:55,460
HAS BEEN POLITICIZED, SO THERE 

7372
05:36:55,460 --> 05:36:56,094
IS TRUTH TO THAT THAT THEY 

7373
05:36:56,094 --> 05:36:56,728
SHOULD HAVE NEVER REVEALED THE 

7374
05:36:56,728 --> 05:36:57,296
IDENTITY OF DR. FORD, SHE 

7375
05:36:57,296 --> 05:36:57,663
DESERVED THAT. 

7376
05:36:57,663 --> 05:36:58,263
BUT NOW THAT IT'S IN THIS 

7377
05:36:58,263 --> 05:36:58,864
HEIGHTENED ENVIRONMENT, THERE 

7378
05:36:58,864 --> 05:36:59,464
ARE STILL QUESTIONS REMAINING 

7379
05:36:59,464 --> 05:37:00,098
ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, PRICE. 

7380
05:37:00,098 --> 05:37:00,532
D THIS IS NOT -- 

7381
05:37:00,532 --> 05:37:01,166
>> WHAT WOULD THAT PRICE BE, 

7382
05:37:01,166 --> 05:37:01,533
THOUGH, LESLIE? 

7383
05:37:01,533 --> 05:37:02,267
>> THIS IS NOT -- REENA, I WISH 

7384
05:37:02,267 --> 05:37:02,801
I COULD SAY ONE FOR ONE. 

7385
05:37:02,801 --> 05:37:03,402
THIS IS GOING TO PERCOLATE. 

7386
05:37:03,402 --> 05:37:04,002
THIS IS GOING TO BE TALKED 

7387
05:37:04,002 --> 05:37:04,703
ABOUT IN THE BEAUTY PARLORS, ON 

7388
05:37:04,703 --> 05:37:05,337
THE GOLF RANGE, AT THE ELITE 

7389
05:37:05,337 --> 05:37:05,971
BOARDING SCHOOLS, IN THE IVORY 

7390
05:37:05,971 --> 05:37:06,605
TOWER AND EVERYBODY IS GETTING 

7391
05:37:06,605 --> 05:37:06,905
A CAR WASH. 

7392
05:37:06,905 --> 05:37:07,439
THE INTERESTING PART, YOU 

7393
05:37:07,439 --> 05:37:08,040
TALKED ABOUT IT, PEOPLE ARE 

7394
05:37:08,040 --> 05:37:08,707
SAYING I SAW THIS, BUT I DIDN'T 

7395
05:37:08,707 --> 05:37:09,341
HEAR IT, MAYBE PERHAPS WE WERE 

7396
05:37:09,341 --> 05:37:09,908
GOING THROUGH AN AIRPORT, 

7397
05:37:09,908 --> 05:37:10,409
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY 

7398
05:37:10,409 --> 05:37:10,976
LISTENING, BUT REASONABLE 

7399
05:37:10,976 --> 05:37:11,643
PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHAT IS THE 

7400
05:37:11,643 --> 05:37:11,844
RUSH? 

7401
05:37:11,844 --> 05:37:12,544
CAN WE FINALLY JUST REALLY KNOW 

7402
05:37:12,544 --> 05:37:13,111
THE TRUTH HERE ABOUT WHAT 

7403
05:37:13,111 --> 05:37:13,378
HAPPENED? 

7404
05:37:13,378 --> 05:37:14,012
AND THAT'S THE REASON PEOPLE 

7405
05:37:14,012 --> 05:37:14,613
WHO ARE NOT POLITICAL, THAT 

7406
05:37:14,613 --> 05:37:15,314
THEY FEEL THAT A LITTLE BIT OF 

7407
05:37:15,314 --> 05:37:15,948
TIME WOULD GIVE IT A NATURAL 

7408
05:37:15,948 --> 05:37:16,582
INCLUSION, MORE PEOPLE WOULD 

7409
05:37:16,582 --> 05:37:17,216
COME OUT, HE'D BE CLEARED BY 

7410
05:37:17,216 --> 05:37:17,516
THE F.B.I. 

7411
05:37:17,516 --> 05:37:18,150
IF THAT WERE THE CASE, I FEEL 

7412
05:37:18,150 --> 05:37:18,717
THERE WOULD BE A LOT MORE 

7413
05:37:18,717 --> 05:37:19,284
COMFORT LEVEL AMONG WOMEN. 

7414
05:37:19,284 --> 05:37:19,918
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A LUXURY 

7415
05:37:19,918 --> 05:37:20,552
THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE RIGHT 

7416
05:37:20,552 --> 05:37:20,752
NOW. 

7417
05:37:20,752 --> 05:37:21,220
>> REALLY QUICKLY. 

7418
05:37:21,220 --> 05:37:21,887
I WAS GOING TO SAY, LESLIE, YOU 

7419
05:37:21,887 --> 05:37:22,387
BROUGHT UP EARLIER IS 

7420
05:37:22,387 --> 05:37:23,088
ESSENTIALLY THEY HAVE NO CHOICE 

7421
05:37:23,088 --> 05:37:23,689
IN WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. 

7422
05:37:23,689 --> 05:37:24,022
IS IT REALLY? 

7423
05:37:24,022 --> 05:37:24,590
I WOULD ARGUE IF YOU'RE A 

7424
05:37:24,590 --> 05:37:25,224
REPUBLICAN, THE BEST SCENARIO 

7425
05:37:25,224 --> 05:37:25,891
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH IS CONVINCE, 

7426
05:37:25,891 --> 05:37:26,525
HE WITHDRAWS, YOU PUT ANOTHER 

7427
05:37:26,525 --> 05:37:27,125
CONSERVATIVE WHO'S JUST AS 

7428
05:37:27,125 --> 05:37:27,793
STRONG AND YOU USE IT TO WHIP 

7429
05:37:27,793 --> 05:37:28,427
UP YOUR BASE THIS NOVEMBER. 

7430
05:37:28,427 --> 05:37:29,061
INSTEAD YOU HAVE AN OPPOSITE 

7431
05:37:29,061 --> 05:37:29,661
SITUATION WHERE NOW WOMEN AND 

7432
05:37:29,661 --> 05:37:30,195
DEMOCRATS ARE EVEN MORE 

7433
05:37:30,195 --> 05:37:30,495
GALVANIZED. 

7434
05:37:30,495 --> 05:37:31,096
>> I WANT TO INTERRUPT ONE 

7435
05:37:31,096 --> 05:37:31,330
SECOND. 

7436
05:37:31,330 --> 05:37:31,997
WE SEE FLAKE, FEINSTEIN, SOME 

7437
05:37:31,997 --> 05:37:32,664
OF THE DEMOCRATS EMERGING THERE 

7438
05:37:32,664 --> 05:37:33,332
AND GRASSLEY HAS ALSO ENTERED. 

7439
05:37:33,332 --> 05:37:33,966
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE 

7440
05:37:33,966 --> 05:37:34,466
DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN. 

7441
05:37:34,466 --> 05:37:35,167
WE ARE -- OUR CAPITOL HILL TEAM 

7442
05:37:35,167 --> 05:37:35,801
IS ON THE GROUND THERE, ALSO 

7443
05:37:35,801 --> 05:37:36,435
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY 

7444
05:37:36,435 --> 05:37:36,802
WHAT WENT ON. 

7445
05:37:36,802 --> 05:37:37,236
BEN SASSE AS WELL. 

7446
05:37:37,236 --> 05:37:37,803
WE JUST SAW FLAKE ENTER AND 

7447
05:37:37,803 --> 05:37:38,337
EXIT A SHORT TIME AGO. 

7448
05:37:38,337 --> 05:37:38,971
LET ME ASK YOU GUYS, LET'S SAY 

7449
05:37:38,971 --> 05:37:39,605
FLAKE CHANGES HIS MIND, BECAUSE 

7450
05:37:39,605 --> 05:37:40,639
THESE AREN'T COMMITTED VOTES úY 

7451
05:37:40,639 --> 05:37:41,273
>> WELL, ESSENTIALLY IT MEANS 

7452
05:37:41,273 --> 05:37:41,907
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD NOT 

7453
05:37:41,907 --> 05:37:42,441
HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE 

7454
05:37:42,441 --> 05:37:43,008
COMMITTEE UNLESS SOMETHING 

7455
05:37:43,008 --> 05:37:43,609
TOTALLY UNEXPECTED HAPPENS. 

7456
05:37:43,609 --> 05:37:44,243
THAT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS 

7457
05:37:44,243 --> 05:37:44,776
BLACK MARK AGAINST HIM. 

7458
05:37:44,776 --> 05:37:45,410
AND, REMEMBER, WE ALL TRY TO 

7459
05:37:45,410 --> 05:37:45,944
MAKE PRIXES ACCORDING TO 

7460
05:37:45,944 --> 05:37:46,478
PROCEDURE -- PREDICTIONS 

7461
05:37:46,478 --> 05:37:47,079
ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE, BUT 

7462
05:37:47,079 --> 05:37:47,679
UNEXPECTED THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 

7463
05:37:47,679 --> 05:37:48,280
THE FAMOUS VOTE WHERE JOHN 

7464
05:37:48,280 --> 05:37:48,947
MCCAIN VOTED AGAINST THE REPEAL 

7465
05:37:48,947 --> 05:37:49,648
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, HE 

7466
05:37:49,648 --> 05:37:50,215
HAD ACTUALLY VOTED ON THE 

7467
05:37:50,215 --> 05:37:50,883
REPUBLICAN SIDE BEFORE THAT ON 

7468
05:37:50,883 --> 05:37:51,516
A PROCEDURAL MATTER AND THEN 

7469
05:37:51,516 --> 05:37:51,917
CHANGED HIS MIND. 

7470
05:37:51,917 --> 05:37:52,584
AND JUST TO GET BACK TO YOUR 

7471
05:37:52,584 --> 05:37:53,151
POINT THAT LESLIE RAISED. 

7472
05:37:53,151 --> 05:37:53,852
THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE KIND 

7473
05:37:53,852 --> 05:37:54,486
OF ISSUE THAT TRANSCENDS THE 

7474
05:37:54,486 --> 05:37:55,153
POLITICAL BUBBLE OR BURSTS OUT 

7475
05:37:55,153 --> 05:37:55,721
OF THE POLITICAL BUBBLE, I 

7476
05:37:55,721 --> 05:37:56,355
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, 

7477
05:37:56,355 --> 05:37:56,989
THAT CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S 

7478
05:37:56,989 --> 05:37:57,589
TESTIMONY HAD SUCH VISCERAL 

7479
05:37:57,589 --> 05:37:57,990
FORCE YESTERDAY. 

7480
05:37:57,990 --> 05:37:58,624
A FEMALE FRIEND OF MINE FROM 

7481
05:37:58,624 --> 05:37:59,258
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC 

7482
05:37:59,258 --> 05:37:59,825
WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, THAT 

7483
05:37:59,825 --> 05:38:00,259
COULD HAVE BEEN ME. 

7484
05:38:00,259 --> 05:38:00,893
SHE WAS WATCHING IT THINKING 

7485
05:38:00,893 --> 05:38:01,460
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME. 

7486
05:38:01,460 --> 05:38:02,160
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF VISCERAL 

7487
05:38:02,160 --> 05:38:02,794
ISSUE THAT POLITICS TYPICALLY 

7488
05:38:02,794 --> 05:38:03,428
THROWS UP, AND I THINK THAT'S 

7489
05:38:03,428 --> 05:38:03,996
WHERE ITS POWER RESIDES AND 

7490
05:38:03,996 --> 05:38:04,529
THAT'S WHY IT IS STILL 

7491
05:38:04,529 --> 05:38:05,130
PECKLATING, WHY PEOPLE HAVE 

7492
05:38:05,130 --> 05:38:05,697
STILL -- PERCOLATING, WHY 

7493
05:38:05,697 --> 05:38:06,198
PEOPLE STILL HAVE NOT 

7494
05:38:06,198 --> 05:38:06,732
THOROUGHLY COME TO THEIR 

7495
05:38:06,732 --> 05:38:07,299
CONCLUDE OF WHAT IT MEANS. 

7496
05:38:07,299 --> 05:38:07,966
>> WE ARE JUST LEARNING -- WE 

7497
05:38:07,966 --> 05:38:08,634
SAW SENATOR FLAKE EXIT THE ROOM 

7498
05:38:08,634 --> 05:38:09,134
WITH DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 

7499
05:38:09,134 --> 05:38:09,768
THEY ARE NOW IN AN ADJACENT 

7500
05:38:09,768 --> 05:38:10,302
BACK ROOM DISCUSSING AND 

7501
05:38:10,302 --> 05:38:10,869
TALKING AT THIS POIMENT. 

7502
05:38:10,869 --> 05:38:11,536
WE KNOW THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

7503
05:38:11,536 --> 05:38:12,204
VOTE AS WE WERE EXPECTING 20 

7504
05:38:12,204 --> 05:38:12,838
MINUTES AGO, REALLY, IT'S NOW 

7505
05:38:12,838 --> 05:38:13,505
DELAYED, A SENATOR IN THE ROOM 

7506
05:38:13,505 --> 05:38:14,172
CONFIRMS THAT VIA TEXT MESSAGE 

7507
05:38:14,172 --> 05:38:14,706
THAT SOMETHING IS AFOOT 

7508
05:38:14,706 --> 05:38:15,374
INVOLVING SENATOR JEFF FLAKE OF 

7509
05:38:15,374 --> 05:38:15,641
ARIZONA. 

7510
05:38:15,641 --> 05:38:16,174
WHAT IS IT, HOW LONG THE 

7511
05:38:16,174 --> 05:38:16,742
PROCEEDING WILL BE DELAYED 

7512
05:38:16,742 --> 05:38:17,442
WHRKS WILL THIS VOTE HAPPEN -- 

7513
05:38:17,442 --> 05:38:18,110
WHEN WILL THIS VOTE HAPPEN, IT 

7514
05:38:18,110 --> 05:38:18,744
IS STILL UNCLEAR, IT'S STILL 

7515
05:38:18,744 --> 05:38:18,977
FLUID. 

7516
05:38:18,977 --> 05:38:19,645
THIS NOTE FROM ED O'KEEFE SAYS 

7517
05:38:19,645 --> 05:38:20,345
THE WORD OF THE DAY HERE FLUID. 

7518
05:38:20,345 --> 05:38:20,846
AND THERE'S ALSO A TOP 

7519
05:38:20,846 --> 05:38:21,346
DEMOCRATIC AIDE SAYING 

7520
05:38:21,346 --> 05:38:21,980
REGARDING FLAKE IT LOOKS LIKE 

7521
05:38:21,980 --> 05:38:22,381
HE IS WAVERING. 

7522
05:38:22,381 --> 05:38:23,015
I ASKED IF HE'S WAVERING ON 

7523
05:38:23,015 --> 05:38:23,649
KAVANAUGH OR WAVERING ON JUST 

7524
05:38:23,649 --> 05:38:24,249
HOLDING THE VOTE WITHOUT AN 

7525
05:38:24,249 --> 05:38:24,616
INVESTIGATION. 

7526
05:38:24,616 --> 05:38:25,017
HE DIDN'T KNOW. 

7527
05:38:25,017 --> 05:38:25,617
AND THIS IS A QUOTE, CAN'T 

7528
05:38:25,617 --> 05:38:26,251
TELL, I WASN'T IN THERE FROM 

7529
05:38:26,251 --> 05:38:26,551
THE START. 

7530
05:38:26,551 --> 05:38:27,219
SO EVEN FOLKS WHO ARE AIDES AND 

7531
05:38:27,219 --> 05:38:27,786
PART OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE 

7532
05:38:27,786 --> 05:38:28,387
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S 

7533
05:38:28,387 --> 05:38:28,654
GOING ON. 

7534
05:38:28,654 --> 05:38:29,254
>> REENA, I'LL SAY REALLY 

7535
05:38:29,254 --> 05:38:29,821
QUICKLY, THIS IS A REALLY 

7536
05:38:29,821 --> 05:38:30,455
FASCINATING THING BECAUSE SINCE 

7537
05:38:30,455 --> 05:38:31,156
PEOPLE BELIEVE IF YOU JUST GAVE 

7538
05:38:31,156 --> 05:38:31,757
IT A MINUTE, TO INVESTIGATE 

7539
05:38:31,757 --> 05:38:32,424
MORE, FIND OUT MORE, JUST CLEAR 

7540
05:38:32,424 --> 05:38:33,125
THE AIR SOME THAT IT WOULD COME 

7541
05:38:33,125 --> 05:38:33,759
TO ITS OWN NATURAL CONCLUSION. 

7542
05:38:33,759 --> 05:38:34,393
THAT'S A TERM WE HEARD THIS 

7543
05:38:34,393 --> 05:38:34,660
MORNING. 

7544
05:38:34,660 --> 05:38:35,294
WE HEARD ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON 

7545
05:38:35,294 --> 05:38:35,928
WHO SAID HIS WIFE CALLED HIM 

7546
05:38:35,928 --> 05:38:36,528
AFTER WATCHING THIS TESTIMONY 

7547
05:38:36,528 --> 05:38:37,195
AND SAID CAN YOU TAKE SOME TIME 

7548
05:38:37,195 --> 05:38:37,863
NOW BECAUSE I NEED TO SPEAK TO 

7549
05:38:37,863 --> 05:38:38,463
YOU ABOUT THIS, AND SHE JUST 

7550
05:38:38,463 --> 05:38:39,164
REALLY HAD TO PROCESS THIS WITH 

7551
05:38:39,164 --> 05:38:39,698
HER HUSBAND BECAUSE THIS 

7552
05:38:39,698 --> 05:38:40,332
BROUGHT UP A LOT OF EMOTION. 

7553
05:38:40,332 --> 05:38:40,966
AND THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT 

7554
05:38:40,966 --> 05:38:41,633
IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR FAMILY 

7555
05:38:41,633 --> 05:38:42,200
AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THE 

7556
05:38:42,200 --> 05:38:42,701
PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW. 

7557
05:38:42,701 --> 05:38:43,368
SO THIS IS GENERATING -- WHICH 

7558
05:38:43,368 --> 05:38:43,902
IS WHAT I'M SAYING -- 

7559
05:38:43,902 --> 05:38:44,503
CONVERSATIONS IN WAYS THAT 

7560
05:38:44,503 --> 05:38:45,070
PEOPLE JUST CANNOT FULLY 

7561
05:38:45,070 --> 05:38:45,570
PROCESS IN 24 HOURS. 

7562
05:38:45,570 --> 05:38:46,038
THEY NEED A SECOND. 

7563
05:38:46,038 --> 05:38:46,672
AND TO RUSH THIS, THAT'S MY 

7564
05:38:46,672 --> 05:38:47,272
CHALLENGE TO REPUBLICANS, IF 

7565
05:38:47,272 --> 05:38:47,973
HE'S A GOOD ENOUGH NOMINEE, HE 

7566
05:38:47,973 --> 05:38:48,407
CAN STAND THE TIME. 

7567
05:38:48,407 --> 05:38:49,074
BUT THEY FEEL WHICH IS FAIR, A 

7568
05:38:49,074 --> 05:38:49,441
WAVE IS COMING. 

7569
05:38:49,441 --> 05:38:50,108
>> LESLIE, HOLD ON ONE SECOND. 

7570
05:38:50,108 --> 05:38:50,709
SENATOR GRASSLEY HAS GAVELED 

7571
05:38:50,709 --> 05:38:50,876
IN. 

7572
05:38:50,876 --> 05:38:51,543
>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ACTION 

7573
05:38:51,543 --> 05:38:52,210
OVER THE MOTION THAT'S BEFORE 

7574
05:38:52,210 --> 05:38:52,377
US. 

7575
05:38:52,377 --> 05:38:53,111
WE GOTTA MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE 

7576
05:38:53,111 --> 05:38:53,378
HAVE A QUORUM. 

7577
05:38:53,779 --> 05:38:54,346
>> AS A POINT OF PERSONAL 

7578
05:38:54,346 --> 05:38:55,047
PRIVILEGE, I'M GOING TO CALL ON 

7579
05:38:55,047 --> 05:38:55,580
SENATOR FLAKE TO SPEAK. 

7580
05:38:55,580 --> 05:38:56,181
NORMALLY WE WOULD START THE 

7581
05:38:56,181 --> 05:38:56,848
VOTE RIGHT NOW, BUT AS A POINT 

7582
05:38:56,848 --> 05:38:57,482
OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE, I WOULD 

7583
05:38:57,482 --> 05:38:58,016
CALL ON SENATOR FLAKE. 

7584
05:38:58,016 --> 05:38:58,383
>> THANK YOU. 

7585
05:38:58,383 --> 05:38:59,017
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A 

7586
05:38:59,017 --> 05:38:59,685
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER 

7587
05:38:59,685 --> 05:38:59,885
SIDE. 

7588
05:38:59,885 --> 05:39:00,419
WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS 

7589
05:39:00,419 --> 05:39:01,086
ONGOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD 

7590
05:39:01,086 --> 05:39:01,787
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE 

7591
05:39:01,787 --> 05:39:02,421
DILIGENCE HERE, AND I THINK IT 

7592
05:39:02,421 --> 05:39:03,055
WOULD BE PROPER TO DELAY THE 

7593
05:39:03,055 --> 05:39:03,689
FLOOR VOTE FOR UP TO BUT NOT 

7594
05:39:03,689 --> 05:39:04,389
MORE THAN ONE WEEK IN ORDER TO 

7595
05:39:04,389 --> 05:39:04,756
LET THE F.B.I. 

7596
05:39:04,756 --> 05:39:05,390
TO DO AN INVESTIGATION LIMITED 

7597
05:39:05,390 --> 05:39:05,924
IN TIME AND SCOPE TO THE 

7598
05:39:05,924 --> 05:39:06,525
CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE 

7599
05:39:06,525 --> 05:39:07,159
THERE AND LIMIT IN TIME TO NO 

7600
05:39:07,159 --> 05:39:07,592
MORE THAN ONE WEEK. 

7601
05:39:07,592 --> 05:39:08,260
AND I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE 

7602
05:39:08,260 --> 05:39:08,860
BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT 

7603
05:39:08,860 --> 05:39:09,227
UNDERSTANDING. 

7604
05:39:09,227 --> 05:39:09,895
AND I'VE SPOKEN TO A FEW OTHER 

7605
05:39:09,895 --> 05:39:10,562
MEMBERS WHO -- ON MY SIDE OF 

7606
05:39:10,562 --> 05:39:11,229
THE AISLE WHO MAY BE SUPPORTIVE 

7607
05:39:11,229 --> 05:39:11,496
AS WELL. 

7608
05:39:11,496 --> 05:39:12,030
BUT THAT'S MY POSITION. 

7609
05:39:12,030 --> 05:39:12,664
I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO DO 

7610
05:39:12,664 --> 05:39:13,365
WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT 

7611
05:39:13,365 --> 05:39:13,999
WE DO ALL DUE DILIGENCE WITH A 

7612
05:39:13,999 --> 05:39:14,566
NOMINATION THIS IMPORTANT. 

7613
05:39:14,566 --> 05:39:15,200
AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS 

7614
05:39:15,200 --> 05:39:15,801
COMMITTEE HAS ACTED PROPERLY 

7615
05:39:15,801 --> 05:39:16,468
AND THE CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER 

7616
05:39:16,468 --> 05:39:17,135
BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS 

7617
05:39:17,135 --> 05:39:17,736
FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND TO 

7618
05:39:17,736 --> 05:39:18,303
DELAY THIS VOTE IN THIS 

7619
05:39:18,303 --> 05:39:18,937
COMMITTEE FOR A WEEK SO THAT 

7620
05:39:18,937 --> 05:39:19,571
JUDGE -- OR THAT MS. FORD, DR. 

7621
05:39:19,571 --> 05:39:20,205
FORD COULD BE HEARD, AND SHE 

7622
05:39:20,205 --> 05:39:20,572
WAS YESTERDAY. 

7623
05:39:20,572 --> 05:39:21,139
SO THAT'S -- WITH THAT 

7624
05:39:21,139 --> 05:39:21,740
AGREEMENT, I WILL VOTE TO 

7625
05:39:21,740 --> 05:39:22,407
ADVANCE THE BILL TO THE FLOOR. 

7626
05:39:22,407 --> 05:39:22,774
>> CALL ROLL. 

7627
05:39:22,774 --> 05:39:23,442
>> WAIT JUST ONE SECOND, COULD 

7628
05:39:23,442 --> 05:39:23,809
DIANNE SPEAK? 

7629
05:39:23,809 --> 05:39:24,409
>> WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON? 

7630
05:39:24,409 --> 05:39:25,077
>> WE ARE VOTING ON THE MOTION 

7631
05:39:25,077 --> 05:39:25,744
TO REPORT THE NOMINATION TO THE 

7632
05:39:25,744 --> 05:39:25,978

7633
05:39:25,978 --> 05:39:26,345
CALL THE ROLL.

7636
05:39:27,446 --> 05:39:28,046
OF WHAT MR. CHAIRMAN LET THE 

7637
05:39:28,046 --> 05:39:28,480
SENATOR EXPLAIN IT. 

7638
05:39:28,480 --> 05:39:29,147
>> MY UNDERSTANDING, AND IF THE 

7639
05:39:29,147 --> 05:39:29,815
DEMOCRATS COULD SPEAK TO IT, IF 

7640
05:39:29,815 --> 05:39:30,515
CHRIS OR YOU AS WE TALKED ABOUT 

7641
05:39:30,515 --> 05:39:31,149
BEFORE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WOULD 

7642
05:39:31,149 --> 05:39:31,783
ACCEPT AND ENDORSE A ONE-WEEK 

7643
05:39:31,783 --> 05:39:32,017
F.B.I. 

7644
05:39:32,017 --> 05:39:32,651
INVESTIGATION LIMITED IN TIME 

7645
05:39:32,651 --> 05:39:32,951
AND SCOPE. 

7646
05:39:32,951 --> 05:39:33,452
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 

7647
05:39:33,452 --> 05:39:34,086
>> SINCE YOU'RE THE DECIDING 

7648
05:39:34,086 --> 05:39:34,753
VOTE HERE, WE'LL VOTE AND THEN 

7649

DISCUSSION WE'LL GO DO THAT 

7651
05:39:35,921 --> 05:39:36,288
AFTER THE VOTE. 

7652
05:39:36,288 --> 05:39:36,655

THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE 

7692
05:39:51,303 --> 05:39:51,803
TIME TODAY TO HAVE A 

7693
05:39:51,803 --> 05:39:52,137
CONVERSATION. 

7694
05:39:52,137 --> 05:39:52,838
A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE 

7695
05:39:52,838 --> 05:39:53,472
ASKED FOR A ONE-WEEK DELAY IN 

7696
05:39:53,472 --> 05:39:54,106
ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN 

7697
05:39:54,106 --> 05:39:54,339
F.B.I. 

7698
05:39:54,339 --> 05:39:54,806
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT 

7699
05:39:54,806 --> 05:39:55,340
ALLEGATIONS ARE CURRENTLY 

7700
05:39:55,340 --> 05:39:55,841
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. 

7701
05:39:55,841 --> 05:39:56,475
I RESPECT SENATOR FLAKE'S VIEW 

7702
05:39:56,475 --> 05:39:57,142
THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WAS BEST 

7703
05:39:57,142 --> 05:39:57,776
TO RESPECT YOUR HAVING GIVEN 

7704
05:39:57,776 --> 05:39:58,410
DR. FORD THE TIME TO BE HEARD 

7705
05:39:58,410 --> 05:39:58,944
YESTERDAY AND ADVANCE THE 

7706
05:39:58,944 --> 05:39:59,611
NOMINEE TO THE FLOOR, BUT IT IS 

7707
05:39:59,611 --> 05:40:00,245
MY HOPE THAT WE COULD WORK 

7708
05:40:00,245 --> 05:40:00,912
TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS 

7709
05:40:00,912 --> 05:40:01,580
TO DILIGENTLY PURSUE AN F.B.I. 

7710
05:40:01,580 --> 05:40:02,214
INVESTIGATION WITHIN THE NEXT 

7711
05:40:02,214 --> 05:40:02,814
WEEK, NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF 

7712
05:40:02,814 --> 05:40:03,448
DELAY, BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF 

7713
05:40:03,448 --> 05:40:04,049
INVESTIGATING FURTHER EITHER 

7714
05:40:04,049 --> 05:40:04,750
ALLEGATIONS MADE BY DR. FORD OR 

7715
05:40:04,750 --> 05:40:05,317
OTHERS WITH A GOAL TOWARDS 

7716
05:40:05,317 --> 05:40:05,884
DEMONSTRATING A BIPARTISAN 

7717
05:40:05,884 --> 05:40:06,451
COMMITMENT TO DILIGENTLY 

7718
05:40:06,451 --> 05:40:06,885
INVESTIGATING THESE 

7719
05:40:06,885 --> 05:40:07,219
ALLEGATIONS. 

7720
05:40:07,219 --> 05:40:07,753
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7721
05:40:07,753 --> 05:40:08,320

7724
05:40:09,187 --> 05:40:09,788
I WOULD SUPPORT THAT MOTION. 

7725
05:40:09,788 --> 05:40:10,322
I THINK WE DO NEED THIS 

7726
05:40:10,322 --> 05:40:10,689
INVESTIGATION. 

7727
05:40:10,689 --> 05:40:11,390
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I SORT OF 

7728
05:40:11,390 --> 05:40:11,957
MISUNDERSTOOD SENATOR FLAKE 

7729
05:40:11,957 --> 05:40:12,457
WHAT YOU WERE DOING. 

7730
05:40:12,457 --> 05:40:13,058
I THOUGHT IT INCLUDED A ONE-

7731
05:40:13,058 --> 05:40:13,525
WEEK INVESTIGATION. 

7732
05:40:13,525 --> 05:40:14,192
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE 

7733
05:40:14,192 --> 05:40:14,860
MOTION FOR THAT INVESTIGATION. 

7734
05:40:14,860 --> 05:40:15,827
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7735
05:40:15,827 --> 05:40:16,094
SENATOR. TAKE TURNS HERE. -

7736
05:40:16,094 --> 05:40:16,762
>> I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE, BUT 

7737
05:40:16,762 --> 05:40:17,396
WE'RE NOT THE MAJORITY LEADER. 

7738
05:40:17,396 --> 05:40:17,996
SENATOR FLAKE HAS MADE CLEAR 

7739
05:40:17,996 --> 05:40:18,663
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO BE 

7740
05:40:18,663 --> 05:40:19,297
COMFORTABLE ON A FINAL PASSAGE 

7741
05:40:19,297 --> 05:40:19,498
VOTE. 

7742
05:40:19,498 --> 05:40:20,165
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE 

7743
05:40:20,165 --> 05:40:20,432
SAY HERE. 

7744
05:40:20,432 --> 05:40:21,033
THIS WILL BE UP TO SENATOR 

7745
05:40:21,033 --> 05:40:21,666
SCHUMER AND SENATOR McCONNELL. 

7746
05:40:21,666 --> 05:40:22,401
>> IT IS COMPLETELY UP TO THEM. 

7747
05:40:22,401 --> 05:40:22,667
>> YEAH. 

7748
05:40:22,667 --> 05:40:23,301
AND I THINK HE'S MADE HIMSELF 

7749
05:40:23,301 --> 05:40:23,668
VERY CLEAR -- 

7750
05:40:23,668 --> 05:40:23,969
>> SENATOR. 

7751
05:40:23,969 --> 05:40:24,269
LET'S MOVE. 

7752
05:40:24,269 --> 05:40:24,636
SENATOR LEAHY. 

7753
05:40:24,636 --> 05:40:25,003
SENATOR LEAHY. 

7754
05:40:25,003 --> 05:40:25,637
>> WELL, CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO 

7755
05:40:25,637 --> 05:40:26,204
MAKE SURE BECAUSE THIS IS 

7756
05:40:26,204 --> 05:40:26,705
SOMEWHAT UNPRECEDENTED. 

7757
05:40:26,705 --> 05:40:27,305
I DO AGREE WITH THE SENATOR 

7758
05:40:27,305 --> 05:40:27,939
FROM ARIZONA THAT WE SHOULD 

7759
05:40:27,939 --> 05:40:28,340
HAVE THIS FURTHER 

7760
05:40:28,340 --> 05:40:28,707
INVESTIGATION. 

7761
05:40:28,707 --> 05:40:29,341
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT 

7762
05:40:29,341 --> 05:40:30,008
DURING THE WEEK THAT THAT IS 

7763
05:40:30,008 --> 05:40:30,675
TAKING PLACE, THERE WILL BE NO 

7764
05:40:30,675 --> 05:40:31,243
ACTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE 

7765
05:40:31,243 --> 05:40:31,843
UNITED STATES SENATE ON THIS 

7766
05:40:31,843 --> 05:40:32,444
NOMINATION, IS THAT CORRECT? 

7767
05:40:32,444 --> 05:40:33,078
>> THAT CANNOT -- I CANNOT SAY 

7768
05:40:33,078 --> 05:40:33,311
THAT -- 

7769
05:40:33,311 --> 05:40:33,945
>> LET ME SAY AGAIN, I'M NOT 

7770
05:40:33,945 --> 05:40:34,546
MAKING -- I CAN'T MAKE THAT 

7771
05:40:34,546 --> 05:40:35,180
COMMITMENT FOR THE LEADERSHIP. 

7772
05:40:35,180 --> 05:40:35,847
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WOULD BE 

7773
05:40:35,847 --> 05:40:36,481
ONLY COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD 

7774
05:40:36,481 --> 05:40:37,149
ON THE FLOOR -- I'LL MOVE IT 

7775
05:40:37,149 --> 05:40:37,783
OUT OF COMMITTEE, BUT I WILL 

7776
05:40:37,783 --> 05:40:38,417
ONLY BE COMFORTABLE MOVING ON 

7777
05:40:38,417 --> 05:40:38,984
THE FLOOR UNTIL THE F.B.I. 

7778
05:40:38,984 --> 05:40:39,584
HAS DONE MORE INVESTIGATION 

7779
05:40:39,584 --> 05:40:40,085
THAN THEY HAVE ALREADY. 

7780
05:40:40,085 --> 05:40:40,719
IT MAY NOT TAKE THEM A WEEK. 

7781
05:40:40,719 --> 05:40:41,420
I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE 

7782
05:40:41,420 --> 05:40:41,953
WITNESSES MAY NOT WANT TO 

7783
05:40:41,953 --> 05:40:42,621
DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER, BUT I 

7784
05:40:42,621 --> 05:40:43,121
THINK WE OWE THEM DUE 

7785
05:40:43,121 --> 05:40:43,422
DILIGENCE. 

7786
05:40:43,422 --> 05:40:43,822
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7787
05:40:43,822 --> 05:40:44,222
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7788
05:40:44,222 --> 05:40:44,656
>> JUST A MINUTE. 

7789
05:40:44,656 --> 05:40:45,257
ALL I HAVE SAID TO SENATOR 

7790
05:40:45,257 --> 05:40:45,924
FLAKE IS THAT I WOULD ADVOCATE 

7791
05:40:45,924 --> 05:40:46,591
FOR THE POSITION HE TOOK, BUT I 

7792
05:40:46,591 --> 05:40:47,025
DON'T CONTROL THAT. 

7793
05:40:47,025 --> 05:40:47,292
SENATOR. 

7794
05:40:47,292 --> 05:40:47,692
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7795
05:40:47,692 --> 05:40:47,926
>> YES. 

7796
05:40:47,926 --> 05:40:48,360
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR. 

7797
05:40:48,360 --> 05:40:48,927
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE 

7798
05:40:48,927 --> 05:40:49,594
OTHER SENATORS AS WELL WHO MAY 

7799
05:40:49,594 --> 05:40:50,128
BE INTERESTED IN THIS 

7800
05:40:50,128 --> 05:40:50,762
NEGOTIATION ON THE REPUBLICAN 

7801
05:40:50,762 --> 05:40:51,396
SIDE AND THERE'S NOT REALLY A 

7802
05:40:51,396 --> 05:40:51,830
SET AGREEMENT HERE. 

7803
05:40:51,830 --> 05:40:52,497
ALL OF US HAD ALREADY SAID WE 

7804
05:40:52,497 --> 05:40:52,898
WERE VOTING NO. 

7805
05:40:52,898 --> 05:40:53,465
IT IS SIMPLY SENATOR FLAKE 

7806
05:40:53,465 --> 05:40:54,132
WORKING WITH ALL OF US TO SAY 

7807
05:40:54,132 --> 05:40:54,800
FOR THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND 

7808
05:40:54,800 --> 05:40:55,400
THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE 

7809
05:40:55,400 --> 05:40:56,101
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE 

7810
05:40:56,101 --> 05:40:56,668
THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP ON. 

7811
05:40:56,668 --> 05:40:57,269
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS 

7812
05:40:57,269 --> 05:40:57,803
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT. 

7813
05:40:57,803 --> 05:40:58,503
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. 

7814
05:40:58,503 --> 05:40:59,204
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT -- AND, BY 

7815
05:40:59,204 --> 05:40:59,805
THE WAY, IF SENATOR McCONNELL 

7816
05:40:59,805 --> 05:41:00,505
WANTS TO GO FORWARD IN LIGHT OF 

7817
05:41:00,505 --> 05:41:01,173
THAT AND WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL 

7818
05:41:01,173 --> 05:41:01,807
SENATORS THAT HAVEN'T SAID HOW 

7819
05:41:01,807 --> 05:41:02,507
THEY'RE VOTING ON THIS NOMINEE, 

7820
05:41:02,507 --> 05:41:03,175
I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS VERY 

7821
05:41:03,175 --> 05:41:03,809
IMPORTANT WHAT JUST HAPPENED 

7822
05:41:03,809 --> 05:41:04,109
RIGHT NOW. 

7823
05:41:04,109 --> 05:41:04,810
SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN 

7824
05:41:04,810 --> 05:41:05,110
AGREEMENT. 

7825
05:41:05,110 --> 05:41:05,610
IT IS ONE SENATOR WHO'S 

7826
05:41:05,610 --> 05:41:05,944
STANDING UP. 

7827
05:41:05,944 --> 05:41:06,378
>> SENATOR CORNYN. 

7828
05:41:06,378 --> 05:41:07,079
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I JUST WANT TO 

7829
05:41:07,079 --> 05:41:07,679
EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO 

7830
05:41:07,679 --> 05:41:08,346
SENATOR FLAKE FOR ALLOWING THIS 

7831
05:41:08,346 --> 05:41:08,880
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. 

7832
05:41:08,880 --> 05:41:09,481
THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCE OF 

7833
05:41:09,481 --> 05:41:10,115
OPINION AMONG US AS TO WHAT 

7834
05:41:10,115 --> 05:41:10,549
EXACTLY THE F.B.I. 

7835
05:41:10,549 --> 05:41:11,183
INVESTIGATION WOULD CONSIST OF. 

7836
05:41:11,183 --> 05:41:11,817
SOME OF US THINK IT HAS BEEN 

7837
05:41:11,817 --> 05:41:12,451
CONCLUDED AND SUPPLEMENTED BY 

7838
05:41:12,451 --> 05:41:13,118
THIS COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION, 

7839
05:41:13,118 --> 05:41:13,685
OTHERS DISAGREE WITH THAT. 

7840
05:41:13,685 --> 05:41:14,352
BUT I RESPECT THE FACT THAT NOT 

7841
05:41:14,352 --> 05:41:15,020
ONLY SENATOR FLAKE ADVOCATED TO 

7842
05:41:15,020 --> 05:41:15,620
GIVE DR. FORD A CHANCE TO 

7843
05:41:15,620 --> 05:41:16,154
APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE 

7844
05:41:16,154 --> 05:41:16,755
COMMITTEE WHICH WAS THE RIGHT 

7845
05:41:16,755 --> 05:41:17,456
THING TO DO, BUT ALSO THAT HE'S 

7846
05:41:17,456 --> 05:41:18,090
ALLOWED THIS PROCESS TO MOVE 

7847
05:41:18,090 --> 05:41:18,657
FORWARD SUBJECT TO FURTHER 

7848
05:41:18,657 --> 05:41:19,257
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT ABOUT 

7849
05:41:19,257 --> 05:41:19,658
WHAT THE F.B.I. 

7850
05:41:19,658 --> 05:41:20,358
MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COME 

7851
05:41:20,358 --> 05:41:20,926
UP WITH, BUT CERTAINLY HE 

7852
05:41:20,926 --> 05:41:21,593
REMAINS WITH HIS RIGHT TO CAST 

7853
05:41:21,593 --> 05:41:22,094
HIS VOTE AND MAINTAIN 

7854
05:41:22,094 --> 05:41:22,761
SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE THAT WAY. 

7855
05:41:22,761 --> 05:41:23,361
BUT I APPRECIATE HIS SUPPORT 

7856
05:41:23,361 --> 05:41:24,029
FOR A FULL AND FAIR HEARING FOR 

7857
05:41:24,029 --> 05:41:24,696
DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS 

7858
05:41:24,696 --> 05:41:25,263
WELL AS HIS WILLINGNESS TO 

7859
05:41:25,263 --> 05:41:25,831
ALLOW THIS TO GO FORWARD 

7860
05:41:25,831 --> 05:41:26,364
SUBJECT TO HIS REQUEST. 

7861
05:41:26,364 --> 05:41:26,765
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7862
05:41:26,765 --> 05:41:27,165
>> MR. CHAIRMAN. 

7863
05:41:27,165 --> 05:41:27,833
>> I THINK I OUGHT TO CALL ON 

7864
05:41:27,833 --> 05:41:28,266
SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 

7865
05:41:28,266 --> 05:41:28,900
>> IF I THROUGH THE CHAIR COULD 

7866
05:41:28,900 --> 05:41:29,468
ASK A QUESTION OF SENATOR 

7867
05:41:29,468 --> 05:41:30,068
FLAKE, DOES YOUR AMENDMENT 

7868
05:41:30,068 --> 05:41:30,569
INCLUDE CONTINUING THE 

7869
05:41:30,569 --> 05:41:31,136
INVESTIGATION DURING THIS 

7870
05:41:31,136 --> 05:41:31,536
PERIOD OF TIME? 

7871
05:41:31,536 --> 05:41:32,204
>> IF I CAN RESPOND, THERE IS 

7872
05:41:32,204 --> 05:41:32,571
NO AMENDMENT. 

7873
05:41:32,571 --> 05:41:33,071
I'M SIMPLY STATING THE 

7874
05:41:33,071 --> 05:41:33,705
DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD BETWEEN 

7875
05:41:33,705 --> 05:41:34,406
US ALL IS THAT I WOULD HOPE AND 

7876
05:41:34,406 --> 05:41:35,040
I THINK WE HAD SOME AGREEMENT 

7877
05:41:35,040 --> 05:41:35,640
BEFORE THAT THE DEMOCRATS WHO 

7878
05:41:35,640 --> 05:41:36,274
HAVE BEEN I THINK JUSTIFIABLY 

7879
05:41:36,274 --> 05:41:36,842
UNCOMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD 

7880
05:41:36,842 --> 05:41:37,542
COULD PUBLICLY IN AN EFFORT TO 

7881
05:41:37,542 --> 05:41:38,210
BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER SAY 

7882
05:41:38,210 --> 05:41:38,877
THAT WE WOULD FEEL BETTER -- 

7883
05:41:38,877 --> 05:41:39,478
I'M NOT EXPECTING AND TO VOTE 

7884
05:41:39,478 --> 05:41:40,145
YES, BUT NOT TO COMPLAIN THAT 

7885
05:41:40,145 --> 05:41:40,412
AN F.B.I. 

7886
05:41:40,412 --> 05:41:41,046
INVESTIGATION HAS NOT OCCURRED, 

7887
05:41:41,046 --> 05:41:41,746
AND THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO 

7888
05:41:41,746 --> 05:41:41,913
DO. 

7889
05:41:41,913 --> 05:41:42,547
THIS COUNTRY IS BEING RIPPED 

7890
05:41:42,547 --> 05:41:43,148
APART HERE, AND WE'VE GOT TO 

7891
05:41:43,148 --> 05:41:43,715
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO DUE 

7892
05:41:43,715 --> 05:41:44,015
DILIGENCE. 

7893
05:41:44,015 --> 05:41:44,683
I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE 

7894
05:41:44,683 --> 05:41:45,383
A GOOD JOB, BUT I DO THINK THAT 

7895
05:41:45,383 --> 05:41:46,017
WE CAN HAVE A SHORT PAUSE AND 

7896
05:41:46,017 --> 05:41:46,585
MAKE SURE THAT THE F.B.I. 

7897
05:41:46,585 --> 05:41:46,985
CAN INVESTIGATE. 

7898
05:41:46,985 --> 05:41:47,652
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME 

7899
05:41:47,652 --> 05:41:48,286
OF US WOULD HAVE TO AND I'M 

7900
05:41:48,286 --> 05:41:48,887
PREPARED TO DO IT, MAKE A 

7901
05:41:48,887 --> 05:41:49,521
REQUEST TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO 

7902
05:41:49,521 --> 05:41:49,888
ASK THE F.B.I. 

7903
05:41:49,888 --> 05:41:50,455
TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION. 

7904
05:41:50,455 --> 05:41:51,089
IT WOULD BE SHORT AND LIMITED 

7905
05:41:51,089 --> 05:41:51,623
IN SCOPE TO THE CURRENT 

7906
05:41:51,623 --> 05:41:52,190
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 

7907
05:41:52,190 --> 05:41:52,290
MADE. 

7908
05:41:52,491 --> 05:41:53,091
>> BECAUSE THERE'S A TWO-HOUR 

7909
05:41:53,091 --> 05:41:53,592
RULING WE'RE ADJOURNED.

7910
05:41:53,592 --> 05:41:53,625
>>

7911
05:41:53,758 --> 05:41:54,426
TWO HOUR RULE, WE ARE ADJOURNED.

7914
05:41:55,360 --> 05:41:55,961
ON CAPITOL HILL THE SENATE 

7915
05:41:55,961 --> 05:41:56,561
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS VOTED

FOR A VOTE EARLY NEXT WEEK. 

7919
05:41:58,396 --> 05:41:59,097
THAT WAS AN 11-10 VOTE BUT AS 

7920
05:41:59,097 --> 05:41:59,731
PART OF THE PROCESS, SENATOR 

7921
05:41:59,731 --> 05:42:00,432
JEFF FLAKE OF ARIZONA SAID THAT 

7922
05:42:00,432 --> 05:42:01,032

KAVANAUGH BEING CONFIRMED NEXT 

7926
05:42:03,034 --> 05:42:03,702
WEEK ON THE FULL FLOOR UNLESS

05:42:04,369 --> 05:42:04,936
UP TO ONE WEEK INTO THE 

7929
05:42:04,936 --> 05:42:05,604
ALLEGATIONS OF CHRISTINE BLASEY 

7930
05:42:05,604 --> 05:42:06,271
FORD A LOT TOOK PLACE RIGHT NOW 

7931
05:42:06,271 --> 05:42:06,938
AS THESE NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE 

7932
05:42:06,938 --> 05:42:07,672
AND IT O'KEEFE IS STANDING BY.  

7933
05:42:07,672 --> 05:42:08,273
>> Reporter:  THIS IS AN 

7934
05:42:08,273 --> 05:42:08,807
INCREDIBLE DEVELOPMENT. 

7935
05:42:08,807 --> 05:42:09,441
IT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SENATE 

7936
05:42:09,441 --> 05:42:09,875
IS DESIGNED FOR. 

7937
05:42:09,875 --> 05:42:10,475
ESSENTIALLY THE LEVERAGE AND 

7938
05:42:10,475 --> 05:42:11,076
ALL OF THE ATTENTION SHIFTS 

7939
05:42:11,076 --> 05:42:11,743
FROM THE COMMITTEE ROOM TO THE 

7940
05:42:11,743 --> 05:42:12,377
FULL SENATE, WHERE IT IS AN 

7941
05:42:12,377 --> 05:42:13,011
ISSUE FOR ALL 100 SENATORS AND 

7942
05:42:13,011 --> 05:42:13,545
NOT JUST THE 21 ON THE 

7943
05:42:13,545 --> 05:42:13,845
COMMITTEE. 

7944
05:42:13,845 --> 05:42:14,479
WHAT JEFF FLAKE DID THERE IS 

7945
05:42:14,479 --> 05:42:15,147
SAY, I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR 

7946
05:42:15,147 --> 05:42:15,747
THE MOTIONS TO PROCEED TO A 

7947
05:42:15,747 --> 05:42:16,381
FULL DEBATE ON THE SENATE ON 

7948
05:42:16,381 --> 05:42:17,048
THIS NOMINATION UNLESS AND UNTIL

7949
05:42:17,048 --> 05:42:17,582
THERE IS A WEEKLONG FBI 

7950
05:42:17,582 --> 05:42:18,250
INVESTIGATION, AND HE DID THAT, 

7951
05:42:18,250 --> 05:42:18,917
MOST LIKELY KNOWING THAT HE IS 

7952
05:42:18,917 --> 05:42:19,551
NOT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN THAT 

7953
05:42:19,551 --> 05:42:19,951
FEELS THAT WAY. 

7954
05:42:19,951 --> 05:42:20,619
REMEMBER THAT AT THIS HOUR, WE 

7955
05:42:20,619 --> 05:42:21,286
ARE WAITING TO SEE YOUR -- TO 

7956
05:42:21,286 --> 05:42:21,887
HEAR WHAT SUSAN COLLINS OF 

7957
05:42:21,887 --> 05:42:22,487
MAINE AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF 

7958
05:42:22,487 --> 05:42:23,054
ALASKA WOULD DO IN THIS 

7959
05:42:23,054 --> 05:42:23,355
SITUATION. 

7960
05:42:23,355 --> 05:42:23,989
WE KNOW THAT HE HAS CONSULTED 

7961
05:42:23,989 --> 05:42:24,656
WITH THEM ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT 

7962
05:42:24,656 --> 05:42:25,157
VOTE FOR WE HAVE 51 

7963
05:42:25,157 --> 05:42:25,790
REPUBLICANS, 49 MEMBERS OF THE 

7964
05:42:25,790 --> 05:42:26,224
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. 

7965
05:42:26,224 --> 05:42:26,858
IF MORE THAN ONE VOTES NO ON 

7966
05:42:26,858 --> 05:42:27,459
ANY VOTE ON THE FLOOR OF THE 

7967
05:42:27,459 --> 05:42:28,193
SENATE RIGHT NOW, IT IS DEAD IN 

7968
05:42:28,193 --> 05:42:28,493
THE WATER. 

7969
05:42:28,493 --> 05:42:29,127
SO JEFF FLAKE IS SAYING, I AND 

7970
05:42:29,127 --> 05:42:29,761
PRESUMABLY A HANDFUL OF OTHER 

7971
05:42:29,761 --> 05:42:30,362
REPUBLICANS DO NOT WANT TO 

7972
05:42:30,362 --> 05:42:30,962
PROCEED ULESS WE KNOW THAT 

7973
05:42:30,962 --> 05:42:31,563
THERE IS SOME KIND OF FBI 

7974
05:42:31,563 --> 05:42:32,063
INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY. 

7975
05:42:32,063 --> 05:42:32,764
>> RIGHT NOW, THE UP IN THE AIR 

7976
05:42:32,764 --> 05:42:33,398
VOTES -- CORRECT ME IF I AM 

7977
05:42:33,398 --> 05:42:33,632
WRONG. 

7978
05:42:33,632 --> 05:42:34,299
JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN COLLINS, LISA 

7979
05:42:34,299 --> 05:42:34,933
MURKOWSKI, AND THE DEMOCRATS 

7980
05:42:34,933 --> 05:42:35,500
JOE MANSION AND ALSO HEIDI 

7981
05:42:35,500 --> 05:42:35,767
HEITKAMP. 

7982
05:42:35,767 --> 05:42:36,168
IS THAT CORRECT? 

7983
05:42:36,168 --> 05:42:36,701
>> Reporter: CORRECT.  

7984
05:42:36,701 --> 05:42:37,302
IT HAS GONE BACK TO FIVE. 

7985
05:42:37,302 --> 05:42:37,936
THOSE FIVE HAVE NOT PUBLICLY 

7986
05:42:37,936 --> 05:42:38,570
ANNOUNCED WHAT THEY WOULD DO 

7987
05:42:38,570 --> 05:42:39,204
BEYOND THAT JEFF FLAKE AND WE 

7988
05:42:39,204 --> 05:42:39,871
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN 

7989
05:42:39,871 --> 05:42:40,205
CONSULTATION. 

7990
05:42:40,205 --> 05:42:40,805
SUSAN COLLINS REMAINS IN THE 

7991
05:42:40,805 --> 05:42:41,473
CAPITAL, IN HER PRIVATE OFFICE, 

7992
05:42:41,473 --> 05:42:42,140
CONSULTING WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH 

7993
05:42:42,140 --> 05:42:42,407
PARTIES. 

7994
05:42:42,407 --> 05:42:43,041
JOE MANSION IS BACK IN WEST 

7995
05:42:43,041 --> 05:42:43,675
VIRGINIA TODAY, CAMPAIGNING, 

7996
05:42:43,675 --> 05:42:44,342
BUT HE HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH 

7997
05:42:44,342 --> 05:42:45,677
HIS COLLEAGUES AND WHAT WE WILL 

7998
05:42:45,677 --> 05:42:46,344
THAT, YES, THERE IS A CONSENSUS 

7999
05:42:46,344 --> 05:42:46,978
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME 

8000
05:42:46,978 --> 05:42:47,512
KIND OF FBI INVESTIGATION 

8001
05:42:47,512 --> 05:42:48,146
BEFORE THERE IS A FINAL VOTE. 

8002
05:42:48,146 --> 05:42:48,713
REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE 

8003
05:42:48,713 --> 05:42:49,080
STICKING POINT. 

8004
05:42:49,080 --> 05:42:49,748
IT IS THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HAS 

8005
05:42:49,748 --> 05:42:50,215
TO REQUEST THE FBI 

8006
05:42:50,215 --> 05:42:50,815
INVESTIGATION SO THIS GETS 

8007
05:42:50,815 --> 05:42:51,449
THROWN TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE 

8008
05:42:51,449 --> 05:42:52,017
THE PRESIDENT WILL DECIDE. 

8009
05:42:52,017 --> 05:42:52,584
DO WE HAVE SOME KIND OF 

8010
05:42:52,584 --> 05:42:53,251
INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO SAVE 

8011
05:42:53,251 --> 05:42:53,652
THE NOMINATION? 

8012
05:42:53,652 --> 05:42:54,186
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

8013
05:42:54,186 --> 05:42:54,786
NANCY COURTESANS AND CAPITOL 

8014
05:42:54,786 --> 05:42:55,387

THERE IS NANCY.

AND WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT? 

8022
05:42:59,357 --> 05:42:59,991
>> Reporter:  THIS SHOWS HOW 

8023
05:42:59,991 --> 05:43:00,659
MUCH POWER ONE SENATOR HAS WHEN 

8024
05:43:00,659 --> 05:43:01,259
THE SENATE IS DIVIDED 51-49. 

8025
05:43:01,259 --> 05:43:01,927
REPUBLICANS CAN ONLY AFFORD TO 

8026
05:43:01,927 --> 05:43:02,561
LOSE ONE SENATOR AND SO JEFF 

8027
05:43:02,561 --> 05:43:03,195
FLAKE KNOWS THAT HE HAS GOT A 

8028
05:43:03,195 --> 05:43:03,595
LOT OF LEVERAGE. 

8029
05:43:03,595 --> 05:43:04,196
ALL EYES ARE ON THE SENATE 

8030
05:43:04,196 --> 05:43:04,696
MAJORITY LEADER, MITCH 

8031
05:43:04,696 --> 05:43:04,996
McCONNELL. 

8032
05:43:04,996 --> 05:43:05,697
WILL HE AGREE TO HOLD THAT VOTE 

8033
05:43:05,697 --> 05:43:06,164
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK? 

8034
05:43:06,164 --> 05:43:06,831
WILL THE WHITE HOUSE AGREED TO 

8035
05:43:06,831 --> 05:43:07,432
ENABLE THE FBI TO DO THIS 

8036
05:43:07,432 --> 05:43:07,799
INVESTIGATION? 

8037
05:43:07,799 --> 05:43:08,433
JEFF FLAKE HAS BEEN AGONIZING 

8038
05:43:08,433 --> 05:43:09,100
OVER THIS FOR THE PAST DAY AND 

8039
05:43:09,100 --> 05:43:09,768
HE WAS IN THE HEARING, WALKED

OUT SAYING THAT HE HAD A LOT OF 

8041
05:43:10,468 --> 05:43:10,702
DOUBTS. 

8042
05:43:10,702 --> 05:43:11,369
>> NANCY CORTEZ, THANK YOU VERY 

8043
05:43:11,369 --> 05:43:11,870

THE DRAMATIC REVERSAL BY JEFF 

8064
05:43:23,882 --> 05:43:24,316
FLAKE OF ARIZONA. 

8065
05:43:24,316 --> 05:43:24,983
THIS MORNING HE SAID THAT HE 

8066
05:43:24,983 --> 05:43:25,517
WOULD VOTE YES ON BRETT 

8067
05:43:25,517 --> 05:43:26,117
KAVANAUGH AND MOMENTS AGO HE 

8068
05:43:26,117 --> 05:43:26,751

ONE OF THE BIG FOCUSES THAT IT 

8075
05:43:30,255 --> 05:43:30,922
O'KEEFE WAS MENTIONING IS THAT 

8076
05:43:30,922 --> 05:43:31,556
THE WHITE HOUSE NEEDS TO CALL 

8077
05:43:31,556 --> 05:43:32,057
FOR THE INVESTIGATION. 

8078
05:43:32,057 --> 05:43:32,591
YOU DID SOME REPORTING. 

8079
05:43:32,591 --> 05:43:33,225
>>> REMEMBER THAT LAST WEEK 

8080
05:43:33,225 --> 05:43:33,858
WHEN CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S

05:43:38,363 --> 05:43:39,030
IF HE IS JOINED BY ONE OR TWO 

8091
05:43:39,030 --> 05:43:39,598
OTHER REPUBLICANS IN THAT 

8092
05:43:39,598 --> 05:43:40,198
REQUEST, THEN THEY WOULD NOT 

8093
05:43:40,198 --> 05:43:40,765
HAVE THE VOTES UNLESS THE 

8094
05:43:40,765 --> 05:43:41,266
INVESTIGATION OCCURRED. 

8095
05:43:41,266 --> 05:43:41,600
I DON'T NOW. 

8096
05:43:41,600 --> 05:43:42,234
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK THEM. 

8097
05:43:42,234 --> 05:43:42,934
IT IS ONE WEEK IS WHAT SENATOR 

8098
05:43:42,934 --> 05:43:43,568
JEFF FLAKE WAS INTERESTED IN 

8099
05:43:43,568 --> 05:43:44,169
AND YOU CAN DO A LOT IF YOU 

8100
05:43:44,169 --> 05:43:44,803
HAVE THE WHOLE FBI LOOKING AT 

8101
05:43:44,803 --> 05:43:45,270
THINGS IN ONE WEEK. 

8102
05:43:45,270 --> 05:43:45,904
>> DID SENATOR FLAKE BRING THE 

8103
05:43:45,904 --> 05:43:46,404
IDEA TO THE DEMOCRATS? 

8104
05:43:46,404 --> 05:43:47,072
>> YOU SHOULD TALK TO SENATOR 

8105
05:43:47,072 --> 05:43:47,706
FLAKE ABOUT THAT BUT YOU HAVE 

8106
05:43:47,706 --> 05:43:48,373
SEEN HIM TO BE INDEPENDENT IN 

8107
05:43:48,373 --> 05:43:49,040
TERMS OF THE DECISIONS HE MAKES 

8108
05:43:49,040 --> 05:43:49,708
AND WHAT HE SAYS AND HE FELT 

8109
05:43:49,708 --> 05:43:50,342
THAT HE HAD A VERY IMPORTANT 

8110
05:43:50,342 --> 05:43:51,042
ROLE TO PLAY AS A MEMBER OF THE 

8111
05:43:51,042 --> 05:43:51,343
COMMITTEE. 

8112
05:43:51,343 --> 05:43:51,643
THANK YOU. 

8113
05:43:51,643 --> 05:43:52,277
>> Reporter: IS HE STILL IN 

8114
05:43:52,277 --> 05:43:52,510
THERE? 

8115
05:43:52,510 --> 05:43:53,144
NO I BELIEVE HE IS STILL IN 

8116
05:43:53,144 --> 05:43:53,745
THERE A NUMBER OF US  HAD 

8117
05:43:53,745 --> 05:43:54,179
SUGGESTED THE WEEK. 

8118
05:43:54,179 --> 05:43:54,779
I SUGGESTED IT TODAY DID WE 

8119
05:43:54,779 --> 05:43:55,413
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS IS 

8120
05:43:55,413 --> 05:43:55,947
GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY? 

8121
05:43:55,947 --> 05:43:56,114
NO. 

8122
05:43:56,114 --> 05:43:56,781
WE ARE IN A BETTER PLACE THAN 

8123
05:43:56,781 --> 05:43:57,482
WE WERE AT 8 AM THIS MORNING. 

8124
05:43:57,482 --> 05:43:58,149
>>> WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THIS 

8125
05:43:58,149 --> 05:43:58,416
SWITCHED? 

8126
05:43:58,416 --> 05:43:59,017
BUT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD 

8127
05:43:59,017 --> 05:43:59,351
TALK TO HIM. 

8128
05:43:59,351 --> 05:44:00,051
>> THAT WAS AMY KLOBUCHAR WAVY 

8129
05:44:00,051 --> 05:44:00,552
JUDGMENT WEIGHING IN. 

8130
05:44:00,552 --> 05:44:01,152
WE ARE EXPECTING -- LET'S 

8131
05:44:01,152 --> 05:44:01,553
LISTEN TO THIS. 

8132
05:44:01,553 --> 05:44:02,087
THIS IS LINDSEY GRAHAM. 

8133
05:44:02,087 --> 05:44:02,754
>> I HOPE SOME DEMOCRATS WILL 

8134
05:44:02,754 --> 05:44:03,421
SAY, IF WE DO WHAT JEFF FLAKE 

8135
05:44:03,421 --> 05:44:03,955
SAID, THAT WOULD END THE 

8136
05:44:03,955 --> 05:44:04,589
PROCESS DISPUTE, AT LEAST A FEW 

8137
05:44:04,589 --> 05:44:05,323
OF THEM I DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO 

8138
05:44:05,323 --> 05:44:05,924
VOTE FOR THE GUY BUT IF WE 

8139
05:44:05,924 --> 05:44:06,591
ASKED THE FBI TO LOOK AT WHAT 

8140
05:44:06,591 --> 05:44:07,225
IS IN FRONT OF US, NO LONGER 

8141
05:44:07,225 --> 05:44:07,859
THAN A WEEK, THEN THEY WOULD 

8142
05:44:07,859 --> 05:44:08,460
SAY THAT WOULD BE A BETTER 

8143
05:44:08,460 --> 05:44:08,727
PROCESS. 

8144
05:44:08,727 --> 05:44:09,427
THAT WOULD BE PROGRESS AND JEFF 

8145
05:44:09,427 --> 05:44:10,061
FLAKE IS TRYING HIS BEST TO 

8146
05:44:10,061 --> 05:44:10,729
BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND 

8147
05:44:10,729 --> 05:44:11,429
VOTE THE BEST WAY HE KNOWS HOW. 

8148
05:44:11,429 --> 05:44:12,097
I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT IS THE 

8149
05:44:12,097 --> 05:44:12,764
AGREEMENT THAT I WILL GET BACK 

8150
05:44:12,764 --> 05:44:13,031
WITH YOU. 

8151
05:44:13,031 --> 05:44:13,365
I DON'T KNOW. 

8152
05:44:13,365 --> 05:44:14,032
I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM NOW. 

8153
05:44:14,032 --> 05:44:14,733
>> Reporter: IS IT A GOOD IDEA 

8154
05:44:14,733 --> 05:44:15,066
FIANNA DOES? 

8155
05:44:15,066 --> 05:44:15,734
>> THE LAST TIME I LOOKED, YOU 

8156
05:44:15,734 --> 05:44:16,134
NEED 50 VOTES . 

8157
05:44:16,134 --> 05:44:16,568
>>> [ LAUGHTER ] 

8158
05:44:16,568 --> 05:44:17,235
>> ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT RIGHT 

8159
05:44:17,235 --> 05:44:17,902
NOW, WHAT JEFF FLAKE IS SAYING 

8160
05:44:17,902 --> 05:44:18,336
MAKES SENSE TO ME. 

8161
05:44:18,336 --> 05:44:18,970
I AM NOT SPEAKING FOR MITCH. 

8162
05:44:18,970 --> 05:44:19,604
I'M GOING TO TALK WITH JEFF 

8163
05:44:19,604 --> 05:44:20,205
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO EXPLAIN 

8164
05:44:20,205 --> 05:44:20,805
THIS TO DONALD TRUMP I GUESS 

8165
05:44:20,805 --> 05:44:21,306
THAT WILL BE MY JOB. 

8166
05:44:21,306 --> 05:44:21,940
>> Reporter: ARE YOU GOING TO 

8167
05:44:21,940 --> 05:44:22,340
BACK THIS MOVE? 

8168
05:44:22,340 --> 05:44:22,907
>> IF I AM NOTHING, I AM 

8169
05:44:22,907 --> 05:44:23,208
PRACTICAL. 

8170
05:44:23,208 --> 05:44:23,441
OKAY?  

8171
05:44:23,441 --> 05:44:23,942
>> Reporter: THIS IS 

8172
05:44:23,942 --> 05:44:24,276
ASTOUNDING.  

8173
05:44:24,276 --> 05:44:24,843
>> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM 

8174
05:44:24,843 --> 05:44:25,377
WEIGHING IN, A SLIGHTLY 

8175
05:44:25,377 --> 05:44:26,044
LIGHTHEARTED MOMENT, AND SAYING 

8176
05:44:26,044 --> 05:44:26,578
THAT IF ANYTHING I AM A 

8177
05:44:26,578 --> 05:44:26,845
REALIST. 

8178
05:44:26,845 --> 05:44:27,512
THE PRESIDENT HAS CHIMED IN AND 

8179
05:44:27,512 --> 05:44:28,146
WE ARE EXPECTING THAT VIDEO. 

8180
05:44:28,146 --> 05:44:28,780
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT HE 

8181
05:44:28,780 --> 05:44:29,347
THOUGHT, QUOTE, HE HAS NOT 

8182
05:44:29,347 --> 05:44:30,015
THOUGHT AND I'M QUOTING, EVEN A 

8183
05:44:30,015 --> 05:44:30,615
LITTLE BIT ABOUT A POSSIBLE 

8184
05:44:30,615 --> 05:44:31,082
REPLACEMENT FOR BRETT 

8185
05:44:31,082 --> 05:44:31,583
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 

8186
05:44:31,583 --> 05:44:32,183
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FBI 

8187
05:44:32,183 --> 05:44:32,550
INVESTIGATION. 

8188
05:44:32,550 --> 05:44:33,151
YOU NEED THE WHITE HOUSE TO 

8189
05:44:33,151 --> 05:44:33,852
WEIGH IN AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE 

8190
05:44:33,852 --> 05:44:34,352
HEARD LINDSEY GRAHAM, A 

8191
05:44:34,352 --> 05:44:35,020
DIFFERENT TONE FROM YESTERDAY. 

8192
05:44:35,020 --> 05:44:35,620
>> REPULICANS ARE SIGNALING, 

8193
05:44:35,620 --> 05:44:36,254
FINE, WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT 

8194
05:44:36,254 --> 05:44:36,855
TAKES TO GET THE NOMINATION 

8195
05:44:36,855 --> 05:44:37,122
THROUGH. 

8196
05:44:37,122 --> 05:44:38,323
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DURING úT 

8197
05:44:38,323 --> 05:44:38,923
JEFF FLAKE MUST HAVE SOME 

8198
05:44:38,923 --> 05:44:39,591
CONSENSUS FROM AMY MURKOWSKI -- 

8199
05:44:39,591 --> 05:44:40,225
FROM JOE MANSION, THAT THEY 

8200
05:44:40,225 --> 05:44:40,892
WILL NOT HAVE THE VOTES UNLESS 

8201
05:44:40,892 --> 05:44:41,559
THE INVESTIGATION GOES FORWARD. 

8202
05:44:41,559 --> 05:44:42,193
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO AUTHORIZE 

8203
05:44:42,193 --> 05:44:42,794
THE FBI INVESTIGATION AND THE 

8204
05:44:42,794 --> 05:44:43,395
ARGUMENT FROM REPUBLICANS HAS 

8205
05:44:43,395 --> 05:44:43,928
BEEN THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

8206
05:44:43,928 --> 05:44:44,362
UNDERWENT A SIX FBI 

8207
05:44:44,362 --> 05:44:45,030
INVESTIGATIONS AND NOTHING CAME 

8208
05:44:45,030 --> 05:44:45,597
UP, THAT THEY PUT THE NEW 

8209
05:44:45,597 --> 05:44:46,264
ALLEGATION FROM FORD INTO HIS 

8210
05:44:46,264 --> 05:44:46,931
FILE AND SEND IT BACK TO THE 

8211
05:44:46,931 --> 05:44:47,532
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE THERE WAS 

8212
05:44:47,532 --> 05:44:48,199
NO EVIDENCE OF A FEDERAL CRIME, 

8213
05:44:48,199 --> 05:44:48,867
THAT IT WAS NOT THE FBI'S ROLE. 

8214
05:44:48,867 --> 05:44:49,434
THERE IS THE CONCERN THAT 

8215
05:44:49,434 --> 05:44:50,068
DEMOCRATS -- SPLIT I APOLOGIZE 

8216
05:44:50,068 --> 05:44:50,402
TO INTERRUPT. 

8217
05:44:50,402 --> 05:44:51,069
WE WANT TO LISTEN TO LINDSEY 

8218
05:44:51,069 --> 05:44:51,303
GRAHAM. 

8219
05:44:51,303 --> 05:44:51,870
>> SOME OF THE GAMES BEING 

8220
05:44:51,870 --> 05:44:52,103
PLAYED. 

8221
05:44:52,103 --> 05:44:52,804
HE BELIEVES THAT IF THE FBI HAD 

8222
05:44:52,804 --> 05:44:53,471
A FEW MORE DAYS, SOME DEMOCRATS 

8223
05:44:53,471 --> 05:44:54,039
HAVE TOLD HIM THAT WOULD 

8224
05:44:54,039 --> 05:44:54,673
ALLEVIATE THE PROCESS CONCERNS, 

8225
05:44:54,673 --> 05:44:55,340
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT GOING 

8226
05:44:55,340 --> 05:44:55,740
TO VOTE FOR HIM. 

8227
05:44:55,740 --> 05:44:56,441
I THINK THAT WHAT HE IS TRYING 

8228
05:44:56,441 --> 05:44:57,142
TO DO IS END THIS THE BEST THAT 

8229
05:44:57,142 --> 05:44:57,842
HE POSSIBLY CAN, TO ACCOMMODATE 

8230
05:44:57,842 --> 05:44:58,510
SOME PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE 

8231
05:44:58,510 --> 05:44:59,077
AND TO BRING THE COMMITTEE 

8232
05:44:59,077 --> 05:44:59,544
TOGETHER IF POSSIBLE. 

8233
05:44:59,544 --> 05:45:00,078
SO THIS IS DEMOCRACY. 

8234
05:45:00,078 --> 05:45:00,612
AM I MAD AT JEFF PLAY? 

8235
05:45:00,612 --> 05:45:01,212
AM I IN A DIFFERENT PLACE? 

8236
05:45:01,212 --> 05:45:01,413
YES. 

8237
05:45:01,413 --> 05:45:02,013
TURN WHAT IF THE FBI IS NOT 

8238
05:45:02,013 --> 05:45:02,681
DONE WITH THE BACKGROUND CHECK? 

8239
05:45:02,681 --> 05:45:03,381
>> I THINK THAT WHAT JEFF FLAKE 

8240
05:45:03,381 --> 05:45:03,982
IS A, 130 CAN HAVE THE FBI, 

8241
05:45:03,982 --> 05:45:04,582
CIA, AND FOREIGN LEGION AND 

8242
05:45:04,582 --> 05:45:05,283
THEY WILL NOT TELL YOU ANYTHING 

8243
05:45:05,283 --> 05:45:05,817
MORE THAN YOU KNOW NOW. 

8244
05:45:05,817 --> 05:45:06,518
THAT IS MY VIEW BUT WE WILL SEE 

8245
05:45:06,518 --> 05:45:06,885
WHAT HAPPENS. 

8246
05:45:06,885 --> 05:45:07,552
HE SAID THAT A WEEK IS ENOUGH 

8247
05:45:07,552 --> 05:45:08,053
FOR HIM OR MAYBE LESS. 

8248
05:45:08,053 --> 05:45:08,753
WE ARE NOT PLAYING THIS GAME OF 

8249
05:45:08,753 --> 05:45:09,421
OPENING THIS UP AND IT GOES ON 

8250
05:45:09,421 --> 05:45:09,688
FOREVER. 

8251
05:45:09,688 --> 05:45:10,355
WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT I WOULD 

8252
05:45:10,355 --> 05:45:11,056
FEEL BETTER IF THEY HAD A WEEK 

8253
05:45:11,056 --> 05:45:11,756
TO LOOK AT WHAT IS IN FRONT OF 

8254
05:45:11,756 --> 05:45:12,090
US, NO MORE. 

8255
05:45:12,090 --> 05:45:12,757
SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID, OKAY 

8256
05:45:12,757 --> 05:45:13,058
WITH THAT. 

8257
05:45:13,058 --> 05:45:13,658
I WOULD LIKE THEM TO COME 

8258
05:45:13,658 --> 05:45:13,925
FORWARD. 

8259
05:45:13,925 --> 05:45:14,526
I'M GOING TO TALK TO MITCH 

8260
05:45:14,526 --> 05:45:15,026
McCONNELL AND JEFF AND 

8261
05:45:15,026 --> 05:45:15,627
EVENTUALLY ENGAGE WITH THE 

8262
05:45:15,627 --> 05:45:15,960
WHITE HOUSE. 

8263
05:45:15,960 --> 05:45:16,628
AGAIN, I DO NOT THINK THAT WE 

8264
05:45:16,628 --> 05:45:16,928
NEED THIS. 

8265
05:45:16,928 --> 05:45:17,629
I AM LONG SINCE READY TO VOTE I 

8266
05:45:17,629 --> 05:45:18,296
THINK HE HAS BEEN VERY POORLY 

8267
05:45:18,296 --> 05:45:18,930
TREATED, JUDGE KAVANAUGH., DO 

8268
05:45:18,930 --> 05:45:19,631
YOU THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO 

8269
05:45:19,631 --> 05:45:20,131
SAVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

8270
05:45:20,131 --> 05:45:20,432
NOMINATION? 

8271
05:45:20,432 --> 05:45:20,865
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. 

8272
05:45:20,865 --> 05:45:21,499
I THINK THAT JEFF FLAKE FEELS 

8273
05:45:21,499 --> 05:45:22,133
GOOD ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

8274
05:45:22,133 --> 05:45:22,834
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 

8275
05:45:22,834 --> 05:45:23,535
PROCESS IS FAIR BUT YOU NEED TO 

8276
05:45:23,535 --> 05:45:24,135
ASK YOU BUT I'VE NEVER FELT 

8277
05:45:24,135 --> 05:45:24,769
BETTER ABOUT HIM BEING ON THE 

8278
05:45:24,769 --> 05:45:25,370
BENCH THAN I DO RIGHT NOW. 

8279
05:45:25,370 --> 05:45:25,737
>> ALL RIGHT. 

8280
05:45:25,737 --> 05:45:26,371
WE HAVE SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, A 

8281
05:45:26,371 --> 05:45:26,938
DEMOCRAT FROM CONNECTICUT. 

8282
05:45:26,938 --> 05:45:27,639
>> LET'S BE REAL AND PENETRATING

8283
05:45:27,639 --> 05:45:28,340
SO THAT THE TRUTH AND FACTS AND 

8284
05:45:28,340 --> 05:45:28,940
EVIDENCE ARE ALL UNCOVERED. 

8285
05:45:28,940 --> 05:45:29,574
THIS FBI INVESTIGATION CANNOT 

8286
05:45:29,574 --> 05:45:30,141
BE A SHOW OR A CHARADE. 

8287
05:45:30,141 --> 05:45:30,842
IT MUST BE REAL AND IT MUST GO 

8288
05:45:30,842 --> 05:45:31,509
TO THE WITNESSES WHO ARE LIKELY 

8289
05:45:31,509 --> 05:45:32,177
TO PRODUCE FACTS AND EVIDENCE. 

8290
05:45:32,177 --> 05:45:32,744
>> Reporter: IS IT YOUR 

8291
05:45:32,744 --> 05:45:33,378
UNDERSTANDING THAT JEFF FLAKE 

8292
05:45:33,378 --> 05:45:33,978
HAD THE ASSURANCES OF OTHER 

8293
05:45:33,978 --> 05:45:34,579
SENATORS IN THE PARTY BEFORE 

8294
05:45:34,579 --> 05:45:35,113
YOU MADE THIS DECISION? 

8295
05:45:35,113 --> 05:45:35,747
>> SENATOR FLAKE TALKED TO A 

8296
05:45:35,747 --> 05:45:36,381
NUMBER OF SENATORS IN HIS OWN 

8297
05:45:36,381 --> 05:45:37,082
PARTY AS WELL AS  ON OUR SIDE, 

8298
05:45:37,082 --> 05:45:37,716
AND I APPRECIATE THAT HE WAS 

8299
05:45:37,716 --> 05:45:38,249
SEEKING COMMON GROUND. 

8300
05:45:38,249 --> 05:45:38,883
>> Reporter: WHAT CAN HE AND 

8301
05:45:38,883 --> 05:45:39,551
HIS COLLEAGUE TO IF LEADERSHIP 

8302
05:45:39,551 --> 05:45:40,185
DECIDES TO GO AHEAD WITH THE 

8303
05:45:40,185 --> 05:45:40,518
VOTE ANYWAY? 

8304
05:45:40,518 --> 05:45:41,086
>> OBVIOUSLY, SENATOR FLAKE 

8305
05:45:41,086 --> 05:45:41,586
COULD VOTE AGAINST THE 

8306
05:45:41,586 --> 05:45:41,920
NOMINATION.  

8307
05:45:41,920 --> 05:45:42,554
>> Reporter:  DID HE SAY HE 

8308
05:45:42,554 --> 05:45:42,921
WOULD DO THAT? 

8309
05:45:42,921 --> 05:45:43,154
>> NO. 

8310
05:45:43,154 --> 05:45:43,855
HE HAS NOT INDICATED TO ME WHAT 

8311
05:45:43,855 --> 05:45:44,489
HE WOULD DO BUT THE INCENTIVE 

8312
05:45:44,489 --> 05:45:45,090
FOR THE LEADERSHIP FOLLOWING 

8313
05:45:45,090 --> 05:45:45,757
HIS WISHES AS TO THE DELAY AS 

8314
05:45:45,757 --> 05:45:46,191
THEY NEED HIS VOTE. 

8315
05:45:46,191 --> 05:45:46,791
ALONG WITH ALL OF THE OTHER 

8316
05:45:46,791 --> 05:45:47,325
MEMBERS OF THE MAJORITY. 

8317
05:45:47,325 --> 05:45:47,625
THANK YOU. 

8318
05:45:47,625 --> 05:45:48,193
>> Reporter: WHO INITIATED 

8319
05:45:48,193 --> 05:45:48,760
THESE CONVERSATIONS TODAY? 

8320
05:45:48,760 --> 05:45:49,427
WAS IT HIM OR ANOTHER DEMOCRAT? 

8321
05:45:49,427 --> 05:45:49,961
>> I CANNOT COMMENT.  

8322
05:45:49,961 --> 05:45:50,495
>> WE JUST HEARD SENATOR 

8323
05:45:50,495 --> 05:45:50,895
BLUMENTHAL THERE. 

8324
05:45:50,895 --> 05:45:51,529
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS 

8325
05:45:51,529 --> 05:45:52,063
TOSSED BY A CAPITOL HILL 

8326
05:45:52,063 --> 05:45:52,697
REPORTER WAS, DO YOU KNOW IF 

8327
05:45:52,697 --> 05:45:53,298
SENATOR FLAKE HAD SPOKEN TO 

8328
05:45:53,298 --> 05:45:53,865
OTHER REPUBLICAN SENATORS, 

8329
05:45:53,865 --> 05:45:54,232
WHICH IS KEY? 

8330
05:45:54,232 --> 05:45:54,766
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW 

8331
05:45:54,766 --> 05:45:55,400
POWERFUL SENATOR McCONNELL IS 

8332
05:45:55,400 --> 05:45:56,034
BEEN HAVING JEFF FLAKE WITH 

8333
05:45:56,034 --> 05:45:56,601
OTHER REPUBLICANS TAG TEAMING 

8334
05:45:56,601 --> 05:45:56,835
ú 

8335
05:45:56,835 --> 05:45:57,469
>>> THAT IS RIGHT REPUBLICANS 

8336
05:45:57,469 --> 05:45:58,069
COULD LOSE A VOTE AND MIKE 

8337
05:45:58,069 --> 05:45:58,703
PENCE COULD BE THE TIEBREAKER 

8338
05:45:58,703 --> 05:45:59,337
BUT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT 

8339
05:45:59,337 --> 05:45:59,971
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY WITH 

8340
05:45:59,971 --> 05:46:00,538
JEFF FLAKE MEETING WITH A 

8341
05:46:00,538 --> 05:46:01,206
COUPLE OF SENATORS THAT WERE 

8342
05:46:01,206 --> 05:46:01,873
KIND OF ON THE FENCE, IT SEEMS 

8343
05:46:01,873 --> 05:46:02,507
TO US THAT, FOR WHAT WE ARE 

8344
05:46:02,507 --> 05:46:03,141
SEEING, THAT JEFF FLAKE DOES 

8345
05:46:03,141 --> 05:46:03,875
HAVE SOME SICK -- SOME CONSENSUS

8346
05:46:03,875 --> 05:46:04,476
AND OTHERWISE THERE WOULD NOT 

8347
05:46:04,476 --> 05:46:04,976
BE INCENTIVE FOR MITCH 

8348
05:46:04,976 --> 05:46:05,643
McCONNELL TO NOT BRING THIS TO 

8349
05:46:05,643 --> 05:46:05,944
THE FLOOR. 

8350
05:46:05,944 --> 05:46:06,544
>>> WE ARE HEARING FROM THE 

8351
05:46:06,544 --> 05:46:07,212
PRESIDENT AND HE CHIMED IN ON 

8352
05:46:07,212 --> 05:46:07,612
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

8353
05:46:07,612 --> 05:46:08,146
IN MY UNDERSTANDING, NOT 

8354
05:46:08,146 --> 05:46:08,780
CONFIRMED FULLY, BUT THIS IS 

8355
05:46:08,780 --> 05:46:09,447
BEFORE THE JEFF FLAKE SITUATION 

8356
05:46:09,447 --> 05:46:10,115
UNFOLDED HE SAID THAT HE IS 

8357
05:46:10,115 --> 05:46:10,615
DEFERRING TO THE GOP'S 

8358
05:46:10,615 --> 05:46:10,882
SENATORS. 

8359
05:46:10,882 --> 05:46:11,483
HE SPOKE FONDLY ABOUT FORD 

8360
05:46:11,483 --> 05:46:12,083
TESTIMONY AND WHATEVER THEY 

8361
05:46:12,083 --> 05:46:12,684
THINK IS NECESSARY, WITHOUT A 

8362
05:46:12,684 --> 05:46:13,351
DELIBERATE INTERESTING THAT HE 

8363
05:46:13,351 --> 05:46:13,852
SAID WITHOUT A DELAY. 

8364
05:46:13,852 --> 05:46:14,519
>> ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND 

8365
05:46:14,519 --> 05:46:15,153
ABOUT AN FBI INVESTIGATION IS 

8366
05:46:15,153 --> 05:46:15,787
THAT IT WOULD NOT TAKE THAT 

8367
05:46:15,787 --> 05:46:15,987
LONG. 

8368
05:46:15,987 --> 05:46:16,588
>> HERE IS THE PRESIDENT. 

8369
05:46:16,588 --> 05:46:16,955
LET'S LISTEN. 

8370
05:46:16,955 --> 05:46:17,622
>> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT, ANY 

8371
05:46:17,622 --> 05:46:18,256
COMMENT ON THE REQUEST FOR THE 

8372
05:46:18,256 --> 05:46:18,923
DELAY FROM SENATOR FLAKE, A ONE 

8373
05:46:18,923 --> 05:46:19,457
WEEK DELAY FOR THE FBI? 

8374
05:46:19,457 --> 05:46:20,058
I'M GOING TO LET THE SENATE 

8375
05:46:20,058 --> 05:46:20,392
HANDLE THAT. 

8376
05:46:20,392 --> 05:46:21,025
THEY WILL MAKE THEIR DECISIONS 

8377
05:46:21,025 --> 05:46:21,526
AND DO A GOOD JOB.  

8378
05:46:21,526 --> 05:46:21,960
VERY PROFESSIONAL. 

8379
05:46:21,960 --> 05:46:22,627
I AM JUST HEARING A LITTLE BIT 

8380
05:46:22,627 --> 05:46:23,261
ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN 

8381
05:46:23,261 --> 05:46:23,895
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF CHILLY 

8382
05:46:23,895 --> 05:46:24,429
AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

8383
05:46:24,429 --> 05:46:24,896
IMPORTANT SUBJECTS.  

8384
05:46:24,896 --> 05:46:25,597
I AM SURE THAT IT WILL ALL BE 

8385
05:46:25,597 --> 05:46:25,897
VERY GOOD. 

8386
05:46:25,897 --> 05:46:26,531
I GUESS THE BOAT WAS POSITIVE 

8387
05:46:26,531 --> 05:46:27,198
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A DELAY. 

8388
05:46:27,198 --> 05:46:27,866
I WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT IT AS 

8389
05:46:27,866 --> 05:46:28,266
THE DAY GOES ON. 

8390
05:46:28,266 --> 05:46:28,900
I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT BECAUSE 

8391
05:46:28,900 --> 05:46:29,300
WE WERE TOGETHER. 

8392
05:46:29,300 --> 05:46:29,968
>> Reporter: WHAT DID YOU THINK 

8393
05:46:29,968 --> 05:46:30,468
ABOUT  THE DOCTOR FOR 

8394
05:46:30,468 --> 05:46:30,769
TESTIMONY? 

8395
05:46:30,769 --> 05:46:31,436
>> I THOUGHT THAT HER TESTIMONY 

8396
05:46:31,436 --> 05:46:32,036
WAS VERY COMPELLING AND SHE 

8397
05:46:32,036 --> 05:46:32,737
LOOKS LIKE A VERY FINE WOMAN TO 

8398
05:46:32,737 --> 05:46:32,904
ME. 

8399
05:46:32,904 --> 05:46:33,371
A VERY FINE WOMAN. 

8400
05:46:33,371 --> 05:46:33,905
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT 

8401
05:46:33,905 --> 05:46:34,572
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, LIKEWISE,

8402
05:46:34,572 --> 05:46:35,173
WAS REALLY SOMETHING THAT I 

8403
05:46:35,173 --> 05:46:35,673
HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. 

8404
05:46:35,673 --> 05:46:36,141
IT WAS INCREDIBLE. 

8405
05:46:36,141 --> 05:46:36,775
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT, I 

8406
05:46:36,775 --> 05:46:37,409
THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

8407
05:46:37,409 --> 05:46:37,675
COUNTRY. 

8408
05:46:37,675 --> 05:46:38,276
BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY 

8409
05:46:38,276 --> 05:46:38,710
CREDIBLE WITNESS. 

8410
05:46:38,710 --> 05:46:39,310
SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY 

8411
05:46:39,310 --> 05:46:40,011
RESPECTS, AND I THINK THAT -- I 

8412
05:46:40,011 --> 05:46:40,745
DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO 

8413
05:46:40,745 --> 05:46:41,413
CONTINUE ONWARD OR WE ARE GOING 

8414
05:46:41,413 --> 05:46:42,113
TO GET A VOTE OF BUT, AGAIN, I 

8415
05:46:42,113 --> 05:46:42,380
AM HERE. 

8416
05:46:42,380 --> 05:46:42,947
I'M NOT OUT THERE WATCHING 

8417
05:46:42,947 --> 05:46:43,415
BECAUSE I CANNOT BE. 

8418
05:46:43,415 --> 05:46:44,082
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT, ALTHOUGH 

8419
05:46:44,082 --> 05:46:44,649
IT MAY BE BE WILL WATCH 

8420
05:46:44,649 --> 05:46:44,916
TOGETHER. 

8421
05:46:44,916 --> 05:46:45,116
OKAY? 

8422
05:46:45,116 --> 05:46:45,750
WE WILL WATCH TOGETHER I THINK 

8423
05:46:45,750 --> 05:46:46,451
THAT IT WILL WORK OUT VERY WELL 

8424
05:46:46,451 --> 05:46:46,851
FOR THE COUNTRY. 

8425
05:46:46,851 --> 05:46:47,552
I JUST WANTED TO WORK OUT WELL 

8426
05:46:47,552 --> 05:46:47,952
FOR THE COUNTRY. 

8427
05:46:47,952 --> 05:46:48,586
IF THAT HAPPENS, I AM HAPPY. 

8428
05:46:48,586 --> 05:46:49,220
>> Reporter: HAVE YOU THOUGHT 

8429
05:46:49,220 --> 05:46:49,821
ABOUT A REPLACEMENT FOR JUDGE 

8430
05:46:49,821 --> 05:46:50,121
KAVANAUGH? 

8431
05:46:50,121 --> 05:46:50,755
>> NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.  

8432
05:46:50,755 --> 05:46:51,222
I HAVE NO MESSAGE. 

8433
05:46:51,222 --> 05:46:51,956
IT HAS TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS 

8434
05:46:51,956 --> 05:46:52,190
RIGHT. 

8435
05:46:52,190 --> 05:46:52,857
THERE IS NO MESSAGE WHATSOEVER. 

8436
05:46:52,857 --> 05:46:53,558
THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY THINK 

8437
05:46:53,558 --> 05:46:53,858
IS RIGHT. 

8438
05:46:53,858 --> 05:46:54,559
THEY HAVE TO -- I AM SURE THAT 

8439
05:46:54,559 --> 05:46:55,093
IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 

8440
05:46:55,093 --> 05:46:55,794
I'M GOING TO RELY ON ALL OF THE 

8441
05:46:55,794 --> 05:46:56,327
PEOPLE, INCLUDING SENATOR 

8442
05:46:56,327 --> 05:46:56,961
GRASSLEY, WHO IS DOING A VERY 

8443
05:46:56,961 --> 05:46:57,228
GOOD JOB. 

8444
05:46:57,228 --> 05:46:57,896
THAT WOULD BE A DECISION THAT 

8445
05:46:57,896 --> 05:46:58,530
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE AND I 

8446
05:46:58,530 --> 05:46:59,164
SUSPECT THEY WILL BE MAKING 

8447
05:46:59,164 --> 05:46:59,864
SOME DECISIONS SOON, WEATHER TO 

8448
05:46:59,864 --> 05:47:00,598
TAKE A BOAT OR DO WHATEVER THEY 

8449
05:47:00,598 --> 05:47:00,899
WANT TO DO. 

8450
05:47:00,899 --> 05:47:01,533
I WILL BE TOTALLY RELIANT ON 

8451
05:47:01,533 --> 05:47:02,167
WHAT SENATOR GRASSLEY AND THE 

8452
05:47:02,167 --> 05:47:02,667
GROUP DECIDES TO DO.  

8453
05:47:02,667 --> 05:47:03,201
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT 

8454
05:47:03,201 --> 05:47:03,501
VENEZUELA. 

8455
05:47:03,501 --> 05:47:04,135
I WAS WAITING FOR THE QUESTION. 

8456
05:47:04,135 --> 05:47:04,869
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING VENEZUELA 

8457
05:47:04,869 --> 05:47:05,470
A MAGNET MANY OTHER THINGS. 

8458
05:47:05,470 --> 05:47:06,070
A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS 

8459
05:47:06,070 --> 05:47:06,738
GOING ON IN THAT PART OF THE 

8460
05:47:06,738 --> 05:47:06,971
WORLD. 

8461
05:47:06,971 --> 05:47:07,539
CHILE IS REALLY SOMETHING 

8462
05:47:07,539 --> 05:47:08,173
SPECIAL IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT 

8463
05:47:08,173 --> 05:47:08,807
THEY HAVE DONE, HOW FAR THEY 

8464
05:47:08,807 --> 05:47:09,107
HAVE COME. 

8465
05:47:09,107 --> 05:47:09,707
YOU LOOK AT HOW WELL RUN THE 

8466
05:47:09,707 --> 05:47:10,008
COUNTRY IS. 

8467
05:47:10,008 --> 05:47:10,642
I JUST WANT TO SAY IT IS AN 

8468
05:47:10,642 --> 05:47:11,176
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. 

8469
05:47:11,176 --> 05:47:11,543
A GREAT HONOR. 

8470
05:47:11,543 --> 05:47:11,843
THANK YOU. 

8471
05:47:11,843 --> 05:47:12,510
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 

8472
05:47:12,510 --> 05:47:13,011
WHATEVER THEY THINK IS 

8473
05:47:13,011 --> 05:47:13,611
NECESSARY IS OKAY WITH ME. 

8474
05:47:13,611 --> 05:47:14,312
>> IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT -- 

8475
05:47:14,312 --> 05:47:14,913
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS MADE 

8476
05:47:14,913 --> 05:47:15,580
AWARE OF THE DECISION BY JEFF 

8477
05:47:15,580 --> 05:47:16,214
FLAKE AND IN THIS PRESS AVAIL 

8478
05:47:16,214 --> 05:47:16,815
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS 

8479
05:47:16,815 --> 05:47:17,415
AWARE THAT SENATOR FLAKE HAS 

8480
05:47:17,415 --> 05:47:18,049
REVERSED HIS VOTE AND PENDING 

8481
05:47:18,049 --> 05:47:18,550
AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

8482
05:47:18,550 --> 05:47:19,217
WHEN ASKED WHAT MESSAGE HE HAS 

8483
05:47:19,217 --> 05:47:19,751
FOR SENATOR MURKOWSKI AND 

8484
05:47:19,751 --> 05:47:20,452
SENATOR COLLINS, HE SAID I HAVE 

8485
05:47:20,452 --> 05:47:21,152
NO MESSAGE BUT THEY HAVE TO DO 

8486
05:47:21,152 --> 05:47:21,519
WHAT IS RIGHT. 

8487
05:47:21,519 --> 05:47:21,986
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 

8488
05:47:21,986 --> 05:47:22,554
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG 

8489
05:47:22,554 --> 05:47:23,021
JOINS US RIGHT NOW. 

8490
05:47:23,021 --> 05:47:23,588
I AM JUST CURIOUS WHAT A 

8491
05:47:23,588 --> 05:47:24,255
MORNING IT HAS BEEN FOR YOU AND 

8492
05:47:24,255 --> 05:47:24,856
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING? 

8493
05:47:24,856 --> 05:47:25,490
IS THE MESSAGE FROM THE WHITE 

8494
05:47:25,490 --> 05:47:26,124
HOUSE PRESS OFFICE VARIED OR 

8495
05:47:26,124 --> 05:47:26,524
BEEN CONSISTENT? 

8496
05:47:26,524 --> 05:47:27,225
>> Reporter: IT IS IMPORTANT TO 

8497
05:47:27,225 --> 05:47:27,892
POINT OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE 

8498
05:47:27,892 --> 05:47:28,526
PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS 

8499
05:47:28,526 --> 05:47:29,060
AWARE OF SOME SORT OF 

8500
05:47:29,060 --> 05:47:29,727
DEVELOPMENT  THAT INVOLVE JEFF 

8501
05:47:29,727 --> 05:47:30,361
FLAKE, I REALLY DO NOT THINK 

8502
05:47:30,361 --> 05:47:30,995
THAT HE KNOWS YET EXACTLY WHAT 

8503
05:47:30,995 --> 05:47:31,629
THAT MEANS AND HOW THIS COULD 

8504
05:47:31,629 --> 05:47:32,330
PLAY OUT AND A DECISION THAT HE 

8505
05:47:32,330 --> 05:47:32,964
HAS TO MAKE IN THE UPCOMING 

8506
05:47:32,964 --> 05:47:33,164
DAYS. 

8507
05:47:33,164 --> 05:47:33,832
HE CONTINUED TO DEFER TO GOP'S 

8508
05:47:33,832 --> 05:47:34,532
SENATORS, SAYING THAT HE TRUSTS 

8509
05:47:34,532 --> 05:47:34,732
THEM. 

8510
05:47:34,732 --> 05:47:35,366
HE THINKS THAT THEY ARE GOING 

8511
05:47:35,366 --> 05:47:35,900
TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 

8512
05:47:35,900 --> 05:47:36,601
THE FACT IS THAT HE IS THE ONE 

8513
05:47:36,601 --> 05:47:37,168
THAT WILL HAVE TO DECIDE 

8514
05:47:37,168 --> 05:47:37,702
WHETHER TO ORDER THIS  

8515
05:47:37,702 --> 05:47:38,336
INVESTIGATION FROM THE FBI SO 

8516
05:47:38,336 --> 05:47:38,970
EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SAYS 

8517
05:47:38,970 --> 05:47:39,604
THAT HE WILL RELY ON SENATOR 

8518
05:47:39,604 --> 05:47:40,238
GRASSLEY AND MITCH McCONNELL, 

8519
05:47:40,238 --> 05:47:40,872
THAT IS A CONVERSATION THAT 

8520
05:47:40,872 --> 05:47:41,539
THEY WILL ALL, I EXPECT, HAVE 

8521
05:47:41,539 --> 05:47:42,173
VERY SOON AND THEY WILL BE 

8522
05:47:42,173 --> 05:47:42,807
COMING TO HIM TO SAY PRESIDENT 

8523
05:47:42,807 --> 05:47:43,441
TRUMP, LISTEN, I DO NOT THINK 

8524
05:47:43,441 --> 05:47:44,075
THAT WE HAVE THE VOTES ON THE 

8525
05:47:44,075 --> 05:47:44,742
FULL SENATE FLOOR NOW THAT JEFF 

8526
05:47:44,742 --> 05:47:45,210
FLAKE HAS COME OUT. 

8527
05:47:45,210 --> 05:47:45,877
I IMAGINE THAT SENATORS COLLINS 

8528
05:47:45,877 --> 05:47:46,544
AND MURKOWSKI ARE ALSO WITH HIM 

8529
05:47:46,544 --> 05:47:47,111
AND TO DEMAND THAT THIS 

8530
05:47:47,111 --> 05:47:47,779
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THEY MOVE 

8531
05:47:47,779 --> 05:47:48,346
FORWARD WITH A FULL VOTE. 

8532
05:47:48,346 --> 05:47:48,980
EVEN THOUGH, YOU ARE RIGHT AND 

8533
05:47:48,980 --> 05:47:49,614
THAT HE HAD KNOWLEDGED THAT 

8534
05:47:49,614 --> 05:47:50,248
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND IT 

8535
05:47:50,248 --> 05:47:50,915
MADE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE, I'M 

8536
05:47:50,915 --> 05:47:51,616
NOT QUITE SURE THAT HE HAS BEEN 

8537
05:47:51,616 --> 05:47:52,250
BRIEFED ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAS 

8538
05:47:52,250 --> 05:47:52,917
TRANSPIRED AND THAT JEFF FLAKE 

8539
05:47:52,917 --> 05:47:53,585
AND OTHERS COULD BE CALLING FOR 

8540
05:47:53,585 --> 05:47:54,052
THIS INVESTIGATION. 

8541
05:47:54,052 --> 05:47:54,752
IT IS HIS DECISION, EVEN THOUGH 

8542
05:47:54,752 --> 05:47:55,420
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT IT IS 

8543
05:47:55,420 --> 05:47:55,887
UP TO THE SENATORS. 

8544
05:47:55,887 --> 05:47:56,588
HE IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO 

8545
05:47:56,588 --> 05:47:57,288
HAVE TO CALL FOR THE BACKGROUND 

8546
05:47:57,288 --> 05:47:57,655
INVESTIGATION. 

8547
05:47:57,655 --> 05:47:58,289
BEFORE THIS DEVELOPMENT, THE 

8548
05:47:58,289 --> 05:47:58,857
WHITE HOUSE WAS CERTAINLY A 

8549
05:47:58,857 --> 05:47:59,257
VERY OPTIMISTIC. 

8550
05:47:59,257 --> 05:47:59,824
THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEY 

8551
05:47:59,824 --> 05:48:00,492
THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO 

8552
05:48:00,492 --> 05:48:01,125
MAKE IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE. 

8553
05:48:01,125 --> 05:48:01,659
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT 

8554
05:48:01,659 --> 05:48:02,227
ULTIMATELY BRETT KAVANAUGH 

8555
05:48:02,227 --> 05:48:02,827
WOULD BE CONFIRMED BUT THIS 

8556
05:48:02,827 --> 05:48:03,461
DOES CHANGE THE GAME A LITTLE 

8557
05:48:03,461 --> 05:48:04,028
BIT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT 

8558
05:48:04,028 --> 05:48:04,696
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR 

8559
05:48:04,696 --> 05:48:04,996
ALL ALONG. 

8560
05:48:04,996 --> 05:48:05,663
THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE 

8561
05:48:05,663 --> 05:48:06,364
FACTS  AS ALL THE SENATORS MADE 

8562
05:48:06,364 --> 05:48:06,998
THE FINAL VOTE ON THE SENATE 

8563
05:48:06,998 --> 05:48:07,599
FLOOR ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT 

8564
05:48:07,599 --> 05:48:07,866
NOMINEE. 

8565
05:48:07,866 --> 05:48:08,500
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL TRANSPIRE 

8566
05:48:08,500 --> 05:48:09,100
FROM THE FBI INVESTIGATION? 

8567
05:48:09,100 --> 05:48:09,634
IF THERE WILL BE ONE. 

8568
05:48:09,634 --> 05:48:10,301
BUT I IMAGINE IF IT IS MADE 

8569
05:48:10,301 --> 05:48:10,902
CLEAR BY JEFF FLAKE AND OTHER 

8570
05:48:10,902 --> 05:48:11,569
REPUBLICANS THAT THEY WILL NOT 

8571
05:48:11,569 --> 05:48:12,036
VOTE YES WITHOUT AN 

8572
05:48:12,036 --> 05:48:12,637
INVESTIGATION, THE PRESIDENT 

8573
05:48:12,637 --> 05:48:13,304
DOES NOT HAVE MUCH CHOICE BUT 

8574
05:48:13,304 --> 05:48:13,872
TO ORDER ONE, I THINK.  

8575
05:48:13,872 --> 05:48:14,472
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE WHITE 

8576
05:48:14,472 --> 05:48:15,139
HOUSE IS SAYING, NOTHING YET SO 

8577
05:48:15,139 --> 05:48:15,607
FAR ABOUT THIS CIVIC 

8578
05:48:15,607 --> 05:48:15,940
DEVELOPMENT. 

8579
05:48:15,940 --> 05:48:16,508
BEFORE THIS, THE MOOD WAS 

8580
05:48:16,508 --> 05:48:17,108
CERTAINLY UPBEAT ABOUT THAT 

8581
05:48:17,108 --> 05:48:17,742
1:30 PM VOTE AND I IMAGINE, 

8582
05:48:17,742 --> 05:48:18,376
ONCE SOMEBODY EXPLAINS TO THE 

8583
05:48:18,376 --> 05:48:19,043
PRESIDENT THE SITUATION, WE CAN 

8584
05:48:19,043 --> 05:48:19,777
EXPECT MORE FROM HIM AND AS WE 

8585
05:48:19,777 --> 05:48:20,345
HEAR FROM SENATOR LINDSEY 

8586
05:48:20,345 --> 05:48:20,945
GRAHAM, HE APPARENTLY THINKS 

8587
05:48:20,945 --> 05:48:21,579
THAT HE IS THE ONE TO DO A. 

8588
05:48:21,579 --> 05:48:22,213
>> WEED THAT BUT THAT WAS A 

8589
05:48:22,213 --> 05:48:22,847
FUNNY MOMENT AND A GOOD POINT 

8590
05:48:22,847 --> 05:48:23,481
OF DISTINCTION THAT YOU MADE 

8591
05:48:23,481 --> 05:48:24,148
THAT THE PRESIDENT MIGHT NOT BE 

8592
05:48:24,148 --> 05:48:24,782
FULLY BRIEFED ON THIS SO WE 

8593
05:48:24,782 --> 05:48:25,483
SHOULD GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF 

8594
05:48:25,483 --> 05:48:26,117
ROOM TO SEE IF HE TIMES IN 

8595
05:48:26,117 --> 05:48:26,351
LATER. 

8596
05:48:26,351 --> 05:48:26,784
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

8597
05:48:26,784 --> 05:48:27,452
I WANT TO TURN TO IT O'KEEFE, 

8598
05:48:27,452 --> 05:48:28,019
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ON 

8599
05:48:28,019 --> 05:48:28,386
CAPITOL HILL.  

8600
05:48:28,386 --> 05:48:28,887
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? 

8601
05:48:28,887 --> 05:48:29,621
>> Reporter:  AT THIS POINT, AS 

8602
05:48:29,621 --> 05:48:30,321
WEIJIA JIANG JUST SAID, THIS IS 

8603
05:48:30,321 --> 05:48:30,822
IN THE HANDS OF MITCH 

8604
05:48:30,822 --> 05:48:31,122
McCONNELL. 

8605
05:48:31,122 --> 05:48:31,823
IT HAS LEFT THE COMMITTEE ROOM. 

8606
05:48:31,823 --> 05:48:32,490
IT IS THE FULL SENATE'S PROBLEM 

8607
05:48:32,490 --> 05:48:33,024
SO IT HAS BECOME MITCH 

8608
05:48:33,024 --> 05:48:33,625
McCONNELL'S JOB, NUMBER ONE 

8609
05:48:33,625 --> 05:48:34,325
NOW, TO SAVE THIS NOMINATION AS 

8610
05:48:34,325 --> 05:48:34,959
HAS BEEN HIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGE 

8611
05:48:34,959 --> 05:48:35,627
AND HIS VOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP 

8612
05:48:35,627 --> 05:48:36,327
BUT LAST WE CHECKED, AGAIN, IT 

8613
05:48:36,327 --> 05:48:36,995
IS THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HAS TO 

8614
05:48:36,995 --> 05:48:37,629
REQUEST AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

8615
05:48:37,629 --> 05:48:38,296
WHAT MITCH McCONNELL HAS TO DO 

8616
05:48:38,296 --> 05:48:38,930
IS CHECK AND SAY WHO IS WITH 

8617
05:48:38,930 --> 05:48:39,230
JEFF FLAKE? 

8618
05:48:39,230 --> 05:48:39,898
HOW MANY REPUBLICANS AGREE THAT 

8619
05:48:39,898 --> 05:48:40,331
WE SHOULD WAIT? 

8620
05:48:40,331 --> 05:48:41,032
IF MORE THAN ONE OR MORE, SUSAN 

8621
05:48:41,032 --> 05:48:41,566
COLLINS, LISA MURKOWSKI, 

8622
05:48:41,566 --> 05:48:42,267
SOMEBODY ELSE SAYING THAT I AM 

8623
05:48:42,267 --> 05:48:42,901
WITH HIM, THEN MATHEMATICALLY 

8624
05:48:42,901 --> 05:48:43,568
HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO WAIT 

8625
05:48:43,568 --> 05:48:44,202
UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION HAPPENS 

8626
05:48:44,202 --> 05:48:44,869
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE NO 

8627
05:48:44,869 --> 05:48:45,537
REASON TO VOTE YES, MEANING ANY 

8628
05:48:45,537 --> 05:48:46,170
ATTEMPT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 

8629
05:48:46,170 --> 05:48:46,771
THE NOMINATION IN THE FULL 

8630
05:48:46,771 --> 05:48:47,138
SENATE STYLES. 

8631
05:48:47,138 --> 05:48:47,772
THAT IS THE CONVERSATION THAT 

8632
05:48:47,772 --> 05:48:48,439
AS LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID EARLIER 

8633
05:48:48,439 --> 05:48:49,073
HAS TO HAPPEN WITH THE WHITE 

8634
05:48:49,073 --> 05:48:49,307
HOUSE. 

8635
05:48:49,307 --> 05:48:49,941
I HAVE TO SAY THE REALITY IS 

8636
05:48:49,941 --> 05:48:50,608
THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MATH 

8637
05:48:50,608 --> 05:48:51,109
UNLESS YOU LET THE FBI 

8638
05:48:51,109 --> 05:48:51,576
INVESTIGATION HAPPEN. 

8639
05:48:51,576 --> 05:48:52,243
HOW MANY DAYS IT LASTS, WHAT 

8640
05:48:52,243 --> 05:48:52,911
EXACTLY LOOKS INTO COME TO GET 

8641
05:48:52,911 --> 05:48:53,545
SUBPOENAED, ALL OF THAT IS A 

8642
05:48:53,545 --> 05:48:54,245
DETAIL THAT WE DO NOT HAVE AND 

8643
05:48:54,245 --> 05:48:54,979
WE DO NOT KNOW AND WE WILL HAVE 

8644
05:48:54,979 --> 05:48:55,380
TO WAIT AND SEE. 

8645
05:48:55,380 --> 05:48:56,014
AS YOU MENTIONED, WE DO NOT 

8646
05:48:56,014 --> 05:48:56,681
KNOW BUT THERE IS ALSO A THIRD 

8647
05:48:56,681 --> 05:48:57,248
ACCUSER, MICHAEL AVENATTI, 

8648
05:48:57,248 --> 05:48:57,916
REPRESENTING THE THIRD ACCUSER. 

8649
05:48:57,916 --> 05:48:58,483
IS THERE ANY APPETITE ON 

8650
05:48:58,483 --> 05:48:59,150
CAPITOL HILL TO TAKE THAT ON? 

8651
05:48:59,150 --> 05:48:59,751
DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS YOUR 

8652
05:48:59,751 --> 05:49:00,385
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WOULD 

8653
05:49:00,385 --> 05:49:00,919
JUST FOCUS ON DR. FORD? 

8654
05:49:00,919 --> 05:49:01,619
WE DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO 

8655
05:49:01,619 --> 05:49:01,920
UNDERSTAND. 

8656
05:49:01,920 --> 05:49:02,587
IT ONLY HAPPENED THE ONLY THING 

8657
05:49:02,587 --> 05:49:03,154
THAT WILL MATTER IS THE 

8658
05:49:03,154 --> 05:49:03,821
APPETITE AMONG REPUBLICANS. IF 

8659
05:49:03,821 --> 05:49:04,522
MORE THAN ONE REPUBLICAN AGREES 

8660
05:49:04,522 --> 05:49:05,156
WITH THE DEMOCRATS THAT THERE 

8661
05:49:05,156 --> 05:49:05,823
SHOULD BE SOMETHING, IT WILL 

8662
05:49:05,823 --> 05:49:06,424
HAPPEN UNDER THIS SCENARIO 

8663
05:49:06,424 --> 05:49:07,058
BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE 

8664
05:49:07,058 --> 05:49:07,258
MATH. 

8665
05:49:07,258 --> 05:49:07,892
AGAIN, YOU HAVE GOT TO START 

8666
05:49:07,892 --> 05:49:08,493
WITH WHAT DOES SUSAN COLLINS 

8667
05:49:08,493 --> 05:49:08,826
WANT TO DO? 

8668
05:49:08,826 --> 05:49:09,460
WHAT DOES LISA MURKOWSKI WANT 

8669
05:49:09,460 --> 05:49:09,694
TO DO? 

8670
05:49:09,694 --> 05:49:10,295
DO THEY AGREE WITH THE JEFF 

8671
05:49:10,295 --> 05:49:10,895
FLAKE AND THE DEMOCRATS THAT 

8672
05:49:10,895 --> 05:49:11,462
THERE SHOULD BE A DELAY? 

8673
05:49:11,462 --> 05:49:12,130
IF THEY SIGNAL AT THIS POINT 

8674
05:49:12,130 --> 05:49:12,697
SOME TIME THIS AFTERNOON 

8675
05:49:12,697 --> 05:49:13,331
TOMORROW THAT THEY AGREE, AND 

8676
05:49:13,331 --> 05:49:13,932
INSTALLS, THEY HAVE TO GET 

8677
05:49:13,932 --> 05:49:14,198
INVOLVED. 

8678
05:49:14,198 --> 05:49:14,799
THERE ARE DEMOCRATS THAT SAY 

8679
05:49:14,799 --> 05:49:15,433
THAT ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE 

8680
05:49:15,433 --> 05:49:15,767
INVESTIGATED. 

8681
05:49:15,767 --> 05:49:16,467
THE FBI SHOULD TAKE EVERYTHING 

8682
05:49:16,467 --> 05:49:16,935
AND FIGURE IT OUT. 

8683
05:49:16,935 --> 05:49:17,569
THAT WOULD LEAD TO SOMETHING 

8684
05:49:17,569 --> 05:49:18,202
THAT LASTS SEVERAL WEEKS WHICH 

8685
05:49:18,202 --> 05:49:18,836
WOULD CERTAINLY BE OKAY WITH 

8686
05:49:18,836 --> 05:49:19,203
MOST DEMOCRATS. 

8687
05:49:19,203 --> 05:49:19,804
IT IS NOT PROBABLY WHAT IS 

8688
05:49:19,804 --> 05:49:20,238
GOING TO HAPPEN. 

8689
05:49:20,238 --> 05:49:20,905
THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE 

8690
05:49:20,905 --> 05:49:21,573
DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE REST 

8691
05:49:21,573 --> 05:49:22,206
OF THE DAY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT 

8692
05:49:22,206 --> 05:49:22,840
TRANSPIRES, AND WE WILL WAIT 

8693
05:49:22,840 --> 05:49:23,508
AND SEE IF WE HEAR BY THE END 

8694
05:49:23,508 --> 05:49:24,175
OF THE DAY, THAT THE PRESIDENT 

8695
05:49:24,175 --> 05:49:24,876
TELLS CHRIS WRAY THAT THEY HAVE 

8696
05:49:24,876 --> 05:49:25,310
TO LOOK INTO THIS. 

8697
05:49:25,310 --> 05:49:25,877
>> DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF 

8698
05:49:25,877 --> 05:49:26,477
EXACTLY WHO SENATOR FLAKE HAS 

8699
05:49:26,477 --> 05:49:27,045
BEEN SPEAKING TO ON THE 

8700
05:49:27,045 --> 05:49:27,445
REPUBLICAN SIDE? 

8701
05:49:27,445 --> 05:49:28,046
YOU MIGHT BE BEHIND HIM AND 

8702
05:49:28,046 --> 05:49:28,479
SUPPORTING THE FBI 

8703
05:49:28,479 --> 05:49:28,846
INVESTIGATION? 

8704
05:49:28,846 --> 05:49:29,447
>> Reporter:  WHETHER THEY 

8705
05:49:29,447 --> 05:49:30,048
SUPPORT THE FBI INVESTIGATION 

8706
05:49:30,048 --> 05:49:30,682
IS STILL UNCLEAR BUT WE KNOW 

8707
05:49:30,682 --> 05:49:31,316
THAT LAST NIGHT  CONSULTATIONS 

8708
05:49:31,316 --> 05:49:31,950
BEGAN WITH LISA MURKOWSKI OF 

8709
05:49:31,950 --> 05:49:32,584
ALASKA, SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE 

8710
05:49:32,584 --> 05:49:33,117
AND JOE MANSION OF WEST 

8711
05:49:33,117 --> 05:49:33,685
VIRGINIA THAT IS THE ONE 

8712
05:49:33,685 --> 05:49:34,319
DEMOCRAT MUST HAVE EXPECTED 

8713
05:49:34,319 --> 05:49:34,953
WOULD ULTIMATELY SUPPORT BRETT 

8714
05:49:34,953 --> 05:49:35,587
KAVANAUGH, GIVEN THE POLITICS 

8715
05:49:35,587 --> 05:49:36,254
OF HIS STATE AND THE FACT THAT 

8716
05:49:36,254 --> 05:49:36,888
HE IS UP FOR REELECTION THIS 

8717
05:49:36,888 --> 05:49:37,088
YEAR. 

8718
05:49:37,088 --> 05:49:37,755
THE PRESIDENT WON THERE BY MORE 

8719
05:49:37,755 --> 05:49:38,389
THAN 40 POINTS AND FACE A LOT 

8720
05:49:38,389 --> 05:49:39,057
OF PRESSURE TO VOTE YES BUT HAS 

8721
05:49:39,057 --> 05:49:39,624
NOT NECESSARILY TELEGRAPHED 

8722
05:49:39,624 --> 05:49:40,325
THAT HE IS GOING TO DO THAT HE 

8723
05:49:40,325 --> 05:49:40,959
HAS BEEN TALKING TO THOSE TWO 

8724
05:49:40,959 --> 05:49:41,593
REPUBLICANS AND CONVERSATIONS. 

8725
05:49:41,593 --> 05:49:42,226
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 

8726
05:49:42,226 --> 05:49:42,794
WERE MADE AWARE OF THIS. 

8727
05:49:42,794 --> 05:49:43,461
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS STARTED, 

8728
05:49:43,461 --> 05:49:44,128
SPARKED BY SOME COMMENTS THAT 

8729
05:49:44,128 --> 05:49:44,762
WERE MADE DURING THE COMMITTEE 

8730
05:49:44,762 --> 05:49:45,330
PROCEEDINGS BY CHRIS OF 

8731
05:49:45,330 --> 05:49:45,830
DELAWARE, A DEMOCRAT. 

8732
05:49:45,830 --> 05:49:46,431
HE AND JEFF FLAKE ARE GOOD 

8733
05:49:46,431 --> 05:49:46,931
FRIENDS, ON THE FOREIGN 

8734
05:49:46,931 --> 05:49:47,599
RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND THEY DO 

8735
05:49:47,599 --> 05:49:48,232
A LOT OF OVERSEAS TRAVEL AND 

8736
05:49:48,232 --> 05:49:48,866
THERE AROUND THE SAME AGE AND 

8737
05:49:48,866 --> 05:49:49,500
HAVE WORKED TO TRY TO BRIDGE 

8738
05:49:49,500 --> 05:49:50,068
THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE TWO 

8739
05:49:50,068 --> 05:49:50,335
PARTIES. 

8740
05:49:50,335 --> 05:49:50,935
HE SPOKE OF THE COMMITTEE. 

8741
05:49:50,935 --> 05:49:51,336
>> I APOLOGIZE. 

8742
05:49:51,336 --> 05:49:51,936
I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU. 

8743
05:49:51,936 --> 05:49:52,503
WE HAVE GOT HIM AND WE ARE 

8744
05:49:52,503 --> 05:49:53,037
GOING TO TAKE CHRIS OF 

8745
05:49:53,037 --> 05:49:53,304
DELAWARE. 

8746
05:49:53,304 --> 05:49:53,905
THEY SIMPLY PRESENT EVIDENCE. 

8747
05:49:53,905 --> 05:49:54,572
I THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER 

8748
05:49:54,572 --> 05:49:55,173
OF SENATORS THAT AFTER DR. 

8749
05:49:55,173 --> 05:49:55,807
FORD'S TESTIMONY BELIEVE THAT 

8750
05:49:55,807 --> 05:49:56,441
THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE 

8751
05:49:56,441 --> 05:49:57,075
THAT HAD NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY 

8752
05:49:57,075 --> 05:49:57,775
EXAMINED AND IT SHOULD BE DONE 

8753
05:49:57,775 --> 05:49:58,476
BUT WE AS SENATORS REACHED THE 

8754
05:49:58,476 --> 05:49:59,043
ULTIMATE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT 

8755
05:49:59,043 --> 05:49:59,644
VOTING FOR OR AGAINST JUDGE 

8756
05:49:59,644 --> 05:50:00,211
KAVANAUGH BUT I THINK THAT 

8757
05:50:00,211 --> 05:50:00,845
THERE WAS ENOUGH DOUBT RAISED 

8758
05:50:00,845 --> 05:50:01,379
YESTERDAY BY DR. FORD'S 

8759
05:50:01,379 --> 05:50:01,980
TESTIMONY THAT A NUMBER OF 

8760
05:50:01,980 --> 05:50:02,580
SENATORS FELT THAT A FURTHER 

8761
05:50:02,580 --> 05:50:03,181
INVESTIGATION WAS JUSTIFIED. 

8762
05:50:03,181 --> 05:50:03,815
>> DID SENATOR FLAKE A MENTION 

8763
05:50:03,815 --> 05:50:04,449
THE PROTESTERS THIS MORNING? 

8764
05:50:04,449 --> 05:50:05,083
DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE 

8765
05:50:05,083 --> 05:50:05,450
STATE OF MIND? 

8766
05:50:05,450 --> 05:50:06,050
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 

8767
05:50:06,050 --> 05:50:06,651
TALK TO SENATOR FLAKE BUT LET 

8768
05:50:06,651 --> 05:50:07,285
ME SIMPLY SAY THIS BUT SENATOR 

8769
05:50:07,285 --> 05:50:07,719
FLAKE IS A GENUINE 

8770
05:50:07,719 --> 05:50:08,052
CONSERVATIVE. 

8771
05:50:08,052 --> 05:50:08,720
HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THE 

8772
05:50:08,720 --> 05:50:09,354
CONSCIENCE OF A CONSERVATIVE. 

8773
05:50:09,354 --> 05:50:09,887
WE DO NOT SHARE A LOT OF 

8774
05:50:09,887 --> 05:50:10,521
POLITICAL VIEWS BUT WE SHARE A 

8775
05:50:10,521 --> 05:50:11,189
DEEP CONCERN -- SORRY. SENATOR 

8776
05:50:11,189 --> 05:50:11,723
FLAKE AND I SHARE A DEEP 

8777
05:50:11,723 --> 05:50:12,390
CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH OF THIS 

8778
05:50:12,390 --> 05:50:13,024
INSTITUTION AND WHAT IT MEANS 

8779
05:50:13,024 --> 05:50:13,691
TO THE REST OF THIS WORLD AND 

8780
05:50:13,691 --> 05:50:14,392
IN THE COUNTRY IF WE ARE UNABLE 

8781
05:50:14,392 --> 05:50:14,859
TO CONDUCT OURSELVES 

8782
05:50:14,859 --> 05:50:15,526
RESPECTFULLY AND IN A WAY THAT 

8783
05:50:15,526 --> 05:50:15,960
HEARS EACH OTHER. 

8784
05:50:15,960 --> 05:50:16,427
IN THE BACK HALLWAY 

8785
05:50:16,427 --> 05:50:17,061
CONVERSATION, A NUMBER OF OUR 

8786
05:50:17,061 --> 05:50:17,729
COLLEAGUES ALSO HAD VERY SHARP 

8787
05:50:17,729 --> 05:50:18,363
CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER 

8788
05:50:18,363 --> 05:50:19,030
ABOUT SOME OF THE PARTISANSHIP 

8789
05:50:19,030 --> 05:50:19,697
AND SOME OF THE POSTURING, AND 

8790
05:50:19,697 --> 05:50:20,264
I FRANKLY THINK THAT WHAT 

8791
05:50:20,264 --> 05:50:20,932
SENATOR FLAKE IS TRYING TO DO 

8792
05:50:20,932 --> 05:50:21,432
IS BOTH ACHIEVE A BRIEF 

8793
05:50:21,432 --> 05:50:22,000
CREDIBLE INVESTIGATION OF 

8794
05:50:22,000 --> 05:50:22,700
ALLEGATIONS IN FRONT OF US AND 

8795
05:50:22,700 --> 05:50:23,368
SERVE AS A ROLE MODEL, AS HE 

8796
05:50:23,368 --> 05:50:24,002
HAS FOR ME TODAY, OF SOMEONE 

8797
05:50:24,002 --> 05:50:24,702
WHO IS REAL JUDGMENT WILLING TO 

8798
05:50:24,702 --> 05:50:25,370
TAKE A REAL POLITICAL RISK AND 

8799
05:50:25,370 --> 05:50:25,970
UPSET MANY IN HIS PARTY BY 

8800
05:50:25,970 --> 05:50:26,638
ASKING FOR A BREAK SO THAT THE 

8801
05:50:26,638 --> 05:50:27,271
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HEAR THAT 

8802
05:50:27,271 --> 05:50:28,006
WE ARE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON 

8803
05:50:28,006 --> 05:50:28,606
SOME THINGS AND THAT EVEN 

8804
05:50:28,606 --> 05:50:29,140
THOUGH HE AND I ARE FROM 

8805
05:50:29,140 --> 05:50:29,641
DIFFERENT PARTIES WITH 

8806
05:50:29,641 --> 05:50:30,274
DIFFERENT VALUES AND DIFFERENT 

8807
05:50:30,274 --> 05:50:30,875
BACKGROUNDS, WE RESPECT EACH 

8808
05:50:30,875 --> 05:50:31,542
OTHER AND WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. 

8809
05:50:31,542 --> 05:50:32,243
I HAVE TRAVELED TO COUNTRIES IN 

8810
05:50:32,243 --> 05:50:32,910
OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD WITH 

8811
05:50:32,910 --> 05:50:33,511
SENATOR FLAKE AND I KNOW HOW 

8812
05:50:33,511 --> 05:50:34,145
PASSIONATELY HE FEELS THAT OUR 

8813
05:50:34,145 --> 05:50:34,812
DIVISION RIGHT NOW TEACHES THE 

8814
05:50:34,812 --> 05:50:35,446
WRONG THING TO THE WORLD ABOUT 

8815
05:50:35,446 --> 05:50:36,080
OUR DEMOCRACY AND SUGGEST THAT 

8816
05:50:36,080 --> 05:50:36,781
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESPECT EACH 

8817
05:50:36,781 --> 05:50:37,448
OTHER OR WORK TOGETHER BUT IF 

8818
05:50:37,448 --> 05:50:38,116
YOU LOOK AT HIS VOTING RECORD 

8819
05:50:38,116 --> 05:50:38,783
IN THE LAST CONGRESS AND MINE, 

8820
05:50:38,783 --> 05:50:39,484
THEY ARE ALMOST AS FAR APART AS 

8821
05:50:39,484 --> 05:50:40,084
THEY CAN BE, YET WE RESPECT 

8822
05:50:40,084 --> 05:50:40,618
EACH OTHER AND CAN WORK 

8823
05:50:40,618 --> 05:50:41,319
TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT IS AN 

8824
05:50:41,319 --> 05:50:41,719
IMPORTANT LESSON. 

8825
05:50:41,719 --> 05:50:42,353
>> WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF THE 

8826
05:50:42,353 --> 05:50:42,954
IMPACT ON THE INSTITUTION AND 

8827
05:50:42,954 --> 05:50:43,621
COUNTRY WOULD BE IF HE DID NOT 

8828
05:50:43,621 --> 05:50:43,955
SUPPORT THIS? 

8829
05:50:43,955 --> 05:50:44,522
>> EXACTLY MY CONCERN AS 

8830
05:50:44,522 --> 05:50:45,189
EXPRESSED IN MY SPEECH TO THE 

8831
05:50:45,189 --> 05:50:45,657
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

8832
05:50:45,657 --> 05:50:46,324
MY CONCERN WAS THAT BY BOWLING 

8833
05:50:46,324 --> 05:50:46,958
THROUGH THE NOMINATION WITHOUT 

8834
05:50:46,958 --> 05:50:47,558
ANY INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD 

8835
05:50:47,558 --> 05:50:48,159
SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL ABOUT 

8836
05:50:48,159 --> 05:50:48,526
PARTISANSHIP. 

8837
05:50:48,526 --> 05:50:49,060
HE WAS IN THE CHAMBER. 

8838
05:50:49,060 --> 05:50:49,727
TRAUMA CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE 

8839
05:50:49,727 --> 05:50:50,094
CONVERSATIONS? 

8840
05:50:50,094 --> 05:50:50,762
YOU SAID THAT THERE WERE SHARP 

8841
05:50:50,762 --> 05:50:51,329
CONVERSATIONS IN THE BACK. 

8842
05:50:51,329 --> 05:50:51,896
>> ANYONE THAT WATCHED THE 

8843
05:50:51,896 --> 05:50:52,430
JUDICIARY HEARING PROCESS 

8844
05:50:52,430 --> 05:50:52,997
YESTERDAY OR THE SPEECHES 

8845
05:50:52,997 --> 05:50:53,631
BEFORE TODAY KNOWS THAT THERE 

8846
05:50:53,631 --> 05:50:54,265
ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 

8847
05:50:54,265 --> 05:50:54,932
WHO ARE ACCUSING EACH OTHER OF 

8848
05:50:54,932 --> 05:50:55,400
ALL SORTS OF THINGS. 

8849
05:50:55,400 --> 05:50:55,967
MY ONE COMMENT WAS SENATOR 

8850
05:50:55,967 --> 05:50:56,634
BIDEN WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR AND 

8851
05:50:56,634 --> 05:50:57,201
SAID TO ME, YOU CAN ALWAYS 

8852
05:50:57,201 --> 05:50:57,802
QUESTION ANOTHER COLLEAGUE 

8853
05:50:57,802 --> 05:50:58,469
PRIORITIES AND YOU CAN QUESTION 

8854
05:50:58,469 --> 05:50:59,103
THEIR POLICIES BUT YOU SHOULD 

8855
05:50:59,103 --> 05:50:59,704
NOT QUESTION THEIR CHARACTER 

8856
05:50:59,704 --> 05:51:00,038
AND MOTIVES. 

8857
05:51:00,038 --> 05:51:00,605
THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH OF 

8858
05:51:00,605 --> 05:51:01,105
QUESTIOING EACH OTHER'S 

8859
05:51:01,105 --> 05:51:01,673
CHARACTERS AND MOTIVES AND 

8860
05:51:01,673 --> 05:51:02,273
THEIR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW 

8861
05:51:02,273 --> 05:51:02,907
WE ALL NEEDED TO LIGHTEN THE 

8862
05:51:02,907 --> 05:51:03,508
EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE GOING 

8863
05:51:03,508 --> 05:51:04,108
AFTER EACH OTHER PERSONALLY. 

8864
05:51:04,108 --> 05:51:04,575
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

8865
05:51:04,575 --> 05:51:05,143
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 

8866
05:51:05,143 --> 05:51:05,810
SPANK SENATOR CHRIS WEIGHING IN 

8867
05:51:05,810 --> 05:51:06,411
AND I WANT TO BRING IN IT 

8868
05:51:06,411 --> 05:51:06,678
O'KEEFE. 

8869
05:51:06,678 --> 05:51:07,278
YOU COULD NOT HAVE PUT THAT 

8870
05:51:07,278 --> 05:51:07,679
SOUND ANY BETTER. 

8871
05:51:07,679 --> 05:51:08,246
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 

8872
05:51:08,246 --> 05:51:08,913
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JEFF 

8873
05:51:08,913 --> 05:51:09,514
FLAKE AND CHRIS AND I DO NOT 

8874
05:51:09,514 --> 05:51:10,214
KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE AND HEAR IT 

8875
05:51:10,214 --> 05:51:10,848
BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE WAS 

8876
05:51:10,848 --> 05:51:11,182
TEARING UP.  

8877
05:51:11,182 --> 05:51:11,449
>> YEAH. 

8878
05:51:11,449 --> 05:51:12,150
AS IF ON CUE, HE SHOWED UP AND 

8879
05:51:12,150 --> 05:51:12,784
WAS QUITE HELPFUL AND COLORING 

8880
05:51:12,784 --> 05:51:13,217
OUR UNDERSTANDING. 

8881
05:51:13,217 --> 05:51:13,651
HERE HE IS AGAIN. 

8882
05:51:13,651 --> 05:51:14,318
THIS IS FOR THE -- ALL RIGHT. 

8883
05:51:14,318 --> 05:51:14,952
>> SENATOR FLAKE AND I RESPECT 

8884
05:51:14,952 --> 05:51:15,253
EACH OTHER. 

8885
05:51:15,253 --> 05:51:15,820
WE HAVE TRAVELED THE WORLD 

8886
05:51:15,820 --> 05:51:16,354
TOGETHER AND LEGISLATED 

8887
05:51:16,354 --> 05:51:16,988
TOGETHER AND WE ARE CONCERNED 

8888
05:51:16,988 --> 05:51:17,689
THAT WHAT WE SAW IN YESTERDAY'S 

8889
05:51:17,689 --> 05:51:18,289
CONFIRMATION HEARING AND IN 

8890
05:51:18,289 --> 05:51:18,823
TODAY'S SPEECHES AND THE 

8891
05:51:18,823 --> 05:51:19,357
COMMITTEE IS TEARING THE 

8892
05:51:19,357 --> 05:51:19,957
COUNTRY APART HE FELT VERY 

8893
05:51:19,957 --> 05:51:20,658
STRONGLY THAT HE WANTED TO SEND 

8894
05:51:20,658 --> 05:51:21,359
A SIGNAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

8895
05:51:21,359 --> 05:51:21,959
THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. 

8896
05:51:21,959 --> 05:51:22,660
WE CAN BREAK ON THE FINAL VOTE 

8897
05:51:22,660 --> 05:51:23,294
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO ASK THE 

8898
05:51:23,294 --> 05:51:23,861
FBI FOR A BRIEF FOCUSED IN 

8899
05:51:23,861 --> 05:51:24,462
SCOPE AND TIME INVESTIGATION 

8900
05:51:24,462 --> 05:51:25,129
AND I SAID I WOULD COME FORWARD 

8901
05:51:25,129 --> 05:51:25,763
AND SAY THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT 

8902
05:51:25,763 --> 05:51:26,364
AND SIGNIFICANT THING FOR HIM 

8903
05:51:26,364 --> 05:51:26,597
TO DO. 

8904
05:51:26,597 --> 05:51:27,165
I BELIEVE THAT HE HAS THE 

8905
05:51:27,165 --> 05:51:27,799
SUPPORT OF SEVERAL COLLEAGUES 

8906
05:51:27,799 --> 05:51:28,399
I HOLDING UP THE FINAL VOTE 

8907
05:51:28,399 --> 05:51:28,866
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. 

8908
05:51:28,866 --> 05:51:29,534
I'M HOPEFUL THAT HE WILL HOLD 

8909
05:51:29,534 --> 05:51:30,101
FIRM UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. 

8910
05:51:30,101 --> 05:51:30,802
I AM GOING TO INSIST THAT THIS 

8911
05:51:30,802 --> 05:51:31,469
BE VIEWED AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 

8912
05:51:31,469 --> 05:51:32,136
US TO WORK TOGETHER ACROSS THE 

8913
05:51:32,136 --> 05:51:32,370
AISLE. 

8914
05:51:32,370 --> 05:51:33,071
>> DID HE TELL YOU THAT HE HAS 

8915
05:51:33,071 --> 05:51:33,671
THE SUPPORT OF THE SENATORS 

8916
05:51:33,671 --> 05:51:34,272
COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI TO GET 

8917
05:51:34,272 --> 05:51:34,605
THE LEVERAGE? 

8918
05:51:34,605 --> 05:51:35,273
MAY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK HIM 

8919
05:51:35,273 --> 05:51:35,907
THAT BUT I KNOW THAT I HAVE 

8920
05:51:35,907 --> 05:51:36,541
ACTIVELY BEEN IN CONVERSATION 

8921
05:51:36,541 --> 05:51:37,208
WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES, DEMOCRAT 

8922
05:51:37,208 --> 05:51:37,875
AND REPUBLICAN, ABOUT THIS IDEA 

8923
05:51:37,875 --> 05:51:38,443
OF A ONE-WEEK PAUSE FOR A 

8924
05:51:38,443 --> 05:51:38,910
LIMITED IN SCOPE FBI 

8925
05:51:38,910 --> 05:51:39,544
INVESTIGATION AND I THINK THAT 

8926
05:51:39,544 --> 05:51:40,111
IS AN ADMIRABLE THING FOR A 

8927
05:51:40,111 --> 05:51:40,778
NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES TO BE 

8928
05:51:40,778 --> 05:51:41,145
ALSO ADVOCATED. 

8929
05:51:41,145 --> 05:51:41,779
>> Reporter: ANY CHANCE THAT 

8930
05:51:41,779 --> 05:51:42,346
YOU COULD VOTE YES  AFTER 

8931
05:51:42,346 --> 05:51:42,580
THIS.? 

8932
05:51:42,580 --> 05:51:43,214
WHAT I AM TENDING TO DO AND 

8933
05:51:43,214 --> 05:51:43,715
WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS 

8934
05:51:43,715 --> 05:51:44,348
CELEBRATING AND RECOGNIZING THE 

8935
05:51:44,348 --> 05:51:44,916
FACT THAT SENATOR FLAKE IS 

8936
05:51:44,916 --> 05:51:45,516
HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN FOR 

8937
05:51:45,516 --> 05:51:46,117
FURTHER INVESTIGATION IN THE 

8938
05:51:46,117 --> 05:51:46,818
INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

8939
05:51:46,818 --> 05:51:47,485
SEEING THAT THE JUDGE CAME -- 

8940
05:51:47,485 --> 05:51:48,052
DR. FORD CAME FORWARD WITH 

8941
05:51:48,052 --> 05:51:48,619
ALLEGATIONS AND THAT JUDGE 

8942
05:51:48,619 --> 05:51:49,220
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY ARE 

8943
05:51:49,220 --> 05:51:49,854
TORMENTED BY THE MORE EXTREME 

8944
05:51:49,854 --> 05:51:50,488
ALLEGATIONS MADE AND THAT IN 

8945
05:51:50,488 --> 05:51:50,955
BOTH CASES A FURTHER 

8946
05:51:50,955 --> 05:51:51,556
INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED. 

8947
05:51:51,556 --> 05:51:52,090
>> WE HAVE GOT TO GO. 

8948
05:51:52,090 --> 05:51:52,724
>> IN ESSENCE, THEY HAVE A 

8949
05:51:52,724 --> 05:51:53,157
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP. 

8950
05:51:53,157 --> 05:51:53,791
THERE WAS SOME REAL STRAIGHT 

8951
05:51:53,791 --> 05:51:54,425
TALK AMONGST EACH OTHER TODAY 

8952
05:51:54,425 --> 05:51:55,026
ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL DAMAGE 

8953
05:51:55,026 --> 05:51:55,660
YESTERDAY COULD CAUSE TO THE 

8954
05:51:55,660 --> 05:51:56,294
INSTITUTION OF THE SENATE AND 

8955
05:51:56,294 --> 05:51:56,828
TO THE COUNTRY OVERALL. 

8956
05:51:56,828 --> 05:51:57,428
IT IS A HIGH WIRE ACT FOR 

8957
05:51:57,428 --> 05:51:57,995
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY'RE 

8958
05:51:57,995 --> 05:51:58,663
PUTTING A LOT OF FAITH IN JEFF 

8959
05:51:58,663 --> 05:51:59,263
FLAKE AND A SMALL HANDFUL OF 

8960
05:51:59,263 --> 05:51:59,864
REPUBLICANS TO GET THAT ONE 

8961
05:51:59,864 --> 05:52:00,565
WEEK, UP TO ONE WEEK EXTENSION, 

8962
05:52:00,565 --> 05:52:01,099
AND PROCEED WITH A VOTE. 

8963
05:52:01,099 --> 05:52:01,733
DO COOLER HEADS PREVAIL AFTER 

8964
05:52:01,733 --> 05:52:01,933
THAT? 

8965
05:52:01,933 --> 05:52:02,633
DOES THE SENATE ULTIMATELY TAKE 

8966
05:52:02,633 --> 05:52:03,267
THE TEACUP AND COOL IT OFF A 

8967
05:52:03,267 --> 05:52:03,568
LITTLE BIT? 

8968
05:52:03,568 --> 05:52:03,901
WE WILL SEE. 

8969
05:52:03,901 --> 05:52:04,435
CERTAINLY AN INTERESTING 

8970
05:52:04,435 --> 05:52:05,103
DEVELOPMENT AND DRIVEN BY GUYS 

8971
05:52:05,103 --> 05:52:05,770
LIKE CHRIS AND JEFF FLAKE THAT 

8972
05:52:05,770 --> 05:52:06,370
HAVE SPENT YEARS TRYING TO 

8973
05:52:06,370 --> 05:52:07,004
BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO 

8974
05:52:07,004 --> 05:52:07,271
PARTIES. 

8975
05:52:07,271 --> 05:52:07,839
>> JUST REALLY QUICKLY TO 

8976
05:52:07,839 --> 05:52:08,506
RECAP, DO WE -- IS THE NEXT 

8977
05:52:08,506 --> 05:52:09,173
THING THAT WE ARE WAITING ON TO 

8978
05:52:09,173 --> 05:52:09,741
HEAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? 

8979
05:52:09,741 --> 05:52:10,408
IS THE -- IT IS IN THE WHITE 

8980
05:52:10,408 --> 05:52:11,075
HOUSE COURT TO DETERMINE IF THE 

8981
05:52:11,075 --> 05:52:11,642
FBI INVESTIGATION HAPPENS? 

8982
05:52:11,642 --> 05:52:12,276
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THIS 

8983
05:52:12,276 --> 05:52:12,577
AFTERNOON? 

8984
05:52:12,577 --> 05:52:13,244
>> Reporter: WE ARE WAITING FOR 

8985
05:52:13,244 --> 05:52:13,811
A SIGNAL FROM A  LEADER 

8986
05:52:13,811 --> 05:52:14,479
McCONNELL THAT HE IS ON BOARD 

8987
05:52:14,479 --> 05:52:15,146
WITH HIS AND HE UNDERSTANDS IT 

8988
05:52:15,146 --> 05:52:15,646
IS SOMETHING THAT HIS 

8989
05:52:15,646 --> 05:52:16,280
COLLEAGUES WANT AND THEN THEY 

8990
05:52:16,280 --> 05:52:16,948
WILL HAVE TO TALK TO THE WHITE 

8991
05:52:16,948 --> 05:52:17,548
HOUSE ABOUT POSSIBLY GETTING 

8992
05:52:17,548 --> 05:52:17,849
THIS DONE. 

8993
05:52:17,849 --> 05:52:18,216
WE WILL SEE. 

8994
05:52:18,216 --> 05:52:18,883
WE SHOULD EXPECTED TO BE FLUID 

8995
05:52:18,883 --> 05:52:19,383
ALL AFTERNOON LONG BUT 

8996
05:52:19,383 --> 05:52:19,984
DEFINITELY START WITH MITCH 

8997
05:52:19,984 --> 05:52:20,618
McCONNELL AND GO TO THE WHITE 

8998
05:52:20,618 --> 05:52:20,852
HOUSE. 

8999
05:52:20,852 --> 05:52:21,519
AT SOME POINT LATER TODAY, WE 

9000
05:52:21,519 --> 05:52:22,086
WILL GET A BETTER SIGNAL. 

9001
05:52:22,086 --> 05:52:22,487
>> IT O'KEEFE. 

9002
05:52:22,487 --> 05:52:23,054
>>> I WAS JUST CHECKING.  

9003
05:52:23,054 --> 05:52:23,755
DEVELOPMENTS ARE SO FLUTED THAT 

9004
05:52:23,755 --> 05:52:24,422
THEY COULD BE ARRIVING IN THE 

9005
05:52:24,422 --> 05:52:24,655
INBOX. 

9006
05:52:24,655 --> 05:52:25,189
SO FAR THEY HAVE NOT. 

9007
05:52:25,189 --> 05:52:25,890
>> WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE 

9008
05:52:25,890 --> 05:52:26,457
CHECKING AND GRATEFUL FOR 

9009
05:52:26,457 --> 05:52:27,091
STREAMING BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE 

9010
05:52:27,091 --> 05:52:27,525
US WHEREVER YOU GO. 

9011
05:52:27,525 --> 05:52:28,192
IT O'KEEFE, WE WILL CHECK BACK 

9012
05:52:28,192 --> 05:52:28,926
WITH YOU . I WANT TO CHECK WITH 

9013
05:52:28,926 --> 05:52:29,227
THE PANEL. 

9014
05:52:29,227 --> 05:52:29,827
THE CBSN POLITICAL REPORTER, 

9015
05:52:29,827 --> 05:52:30,428
AND A COLUMNIST FOR THE HILL, 

9016
05:52:30,428 --> 05:52:30,962
LESLIE SANCHEZ, CBS NEWS 

9017
05:52:30,962 --> 05:52:31,529
CONTRIBUTOR AND REPUBLICAN 

9018
05:52:31,529 --> 05:52:32,063
STRATEGIST, A DEMOCRATIC 

9019
05:52:32,063 --> 05:52:32,396
STRATEGIST. 

9020
05:52:32,396 --> 05:52:32,964
YOU HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED 

9021
05:52:32,964 --> 05:52:33,331
MULTIPLE TIMES. 

9022
05:52:33,331 --> 05:52:33,898
WE HAVE GONE FROM THE FBI 

9023
05:52:33,898 --> 05:52:34,565
INVESTIGATION BUT I WANT TO GET 

9024
05:52:34,565 --> 05:52:34,966
YOUR THOUGHTS.  

9025
05:52:34,966 --> 05:52:35,600
>> Reporter:  THEY LAID OUT 

9026
05:52:35,600 --> 05:52:36,267
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET AN 

9027
05:52:36,267 --> 05:52:36,701
FBI INVESTIGATION. 

9028
05:52:36,701 --> 05:52:37,368
IT IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO 

9029
05:52:37,368 --> 05:52:38,035
NOTE THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATION 

9030
05:52:38,035 --> 05:52:38,569
WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE 

9031
05:52:38,569 --> 05:52:38,870
CONCLUSIVE. 

9032
05:52:38,870 --> 05:52:39,570
SO FAR AS THE DECISION, IT WILL 

9033
05:52:39,570 --> 05:52:40,271
STILL BE UP TO THESE LAWMAKERS. 

9034
05:52:40,271 --> 05:52:40,938
THE FBI WILL COMPLETE IT UNDER 

9035
05:52:40,938 --> 05:52:41,472
THE PROSPECT THAT MITCH 

9036
05:52:41,472 --> 05:52:42,106
McCONNELL SIGNS OFF AND DONALD 

9037
05:52:42,106 --> 05:52:42,673
TRUMP SIGNS OFF AND THE FBI 

9038
05:52:42,673 --> 05:52:43,341
TALKS TOO MANY OF THOSE MEMBERS 

9039
05:52:43,341 --> 05:52:44,008
THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS OR 

9040
05:52:44,008 --> 05:52:44,709
ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED, TALK TO 

9041
05:52:44,709 --> 05:52:45,276
THEM, DOES THE BACKGROUND 

9042
05:52:45,276 --> 05:52:45,943
CHECK, WHICH ACTUALLY COULD BE 

9043
05:52:45,943 --> 05:52:46,611
COMPLETED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. 

9044
05:52:46,611 --> 05:52:47,145
WITH ANITA HILL, IT WAS 

9045
05:52:47,145 --> 05:52:47,812
COMPLETED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS 

9046
05:52:47,812 --> 05:52:48,379
AND SANCTIONED BY PRESIDENT 

9047
05:52:48,379 --> 05:52:48,813
úBU 

9048
05:52:48,813 --> 05:52:49,413
AGAIN, IT WILL PROVIDE SOME 

9049
05:52:49,413 --> 05:52:50,114
INFORMATION AND PRESENT IT BACK 

9050
05:52:50,114 --> 05:52:50,715
TO THE WHITE HOUSE INTO THE 

9051
05:52:50,715 --> 05:52:50,948
SENATE. 

9052
05:52:50,948 --> 05:52:51,582
AGAIN, THE FBI CANNOT DECIDE 

9053
05:52:51,582 --> 05:52:52,216
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, BUT THEY 

9054
05:52:52,216 --> 05:52:52,817
CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION 

9055
05:52:52,817 --> 05:52:53,484
AND AS LESLIE WAS TALKING ABOUT 

9056
05:52:53,484 --> 05:52:54,051
EARLIER, FROM A POLITICAL 

9057
05:52:54,051 --> 05:52:54,719
STANDPOINT, THIS SEEMS TO MAKE 

9058
05:52:54,719 --> 05:52:55,353
A LOT OF SENSE FOR REPUBLICANS 

9059
05:52:55,353 --> 05:52:55,920
ABOUT WANTING THIS -- NOT 

9060
05:52:55,920 --> 05:52:56,587
WANTING THIS TO HOVER OVER THE 

9061
05:52:56,587 --> 05:52:56,854
NOMINEE. 

9062
05:52:56,854 --> 05:52:57,488
BACK JUST TO RECAP, THE DRAMA 

9063
05:52:57,488 --> 05:52:58,189
STARTED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, 

9064
05:52:58,189 --> 05:52:58,790
1:30 PM EASTERN, EXPECTING A 

9065
05:52:58,790 --> 05:52:59,390
VOTE IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

9066
05:52:59,390 --> 05:52:59,690
COMMITTEE. 

9067
05:52:59,690 --> 05:53:00,291
IT WAS DELAYED AND DEMOCRATS 

9068
05:53:00,291 --> 05:53:00,892
DID NOT SHOW UP AND SENATOR 

9069
05:53:00,892 --> 05:53:01,559
JEFF FLAKE LATER ANNOUNCES THAT 

9070
05:53:01,559 --> 05:53:02,126
HE IS HOLDING HIS YES VOTE. 

9071
05:53:02,126 --> 05:53:02,693
HE ANNOUNCED EARLY IN THE 

9072
05:53:02,693 --> 05:53:03,294
MORNING THAT THERE WAS A YES 

9073
05:53:03,294 --> 05:53:03,995
VOTE AND HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE 

9074
05:53:03,995 --> 05:53:04,595
A LIMITED IN SCOPE ONE-WEEK 

9075
05:53:04,595 --> 05:53:05,196
SENATE AND FBI INVESTIGATION 

9076
05:53:05,196 --> 05:53:05,730
INTO THESE ALLEGATIONS. 

9077
05:53:05,730 --> 05:53:06,330
WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT 

9078
05:53:06,330 --> 05:53:06,964
THAT WOULD MEAN AND DOES HE 

9079
05:53:06,964 --> 05:53:07,398
HAVE THE SUPPORT? 

9080
05:53:07,398 --> 05:53:08,032
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHETHER 

9081
05:53:08,032 --> 05:53:08,733
OR NOT -- HOW DO YOU THINK THAT 

9082
05:53:08,733 --> 05:53:09,333
MITCH McCONNELL IS GOING TO 

9083
05:53:09,333 --> 05:53:09,634
RESPOND?  

9084
05:53:09,634 --> 05:53:10,301
MIKE WELL, HE THOUGHT THAT THE 

9085
05:53:10,301 --> 05:53:10,735
SENATE WAS BORING. 

9086
05:53:10,735 --> 05:53:10,968
RIGHT? 

9087
05:53:10,968 --> 05:53:11,636
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY TURN OF 

9088
05:53:11,636 --> 05:53:12,203
EVENTS TO HAVE JEFF FLAKE 

9089
05:53:12,203 --> 05:53:12,904
SWITCH HIS VOTE OR POSITION IN 

9090
05:53:12,904 --> 05:53:13,504
THIS MATTER AFTER EVERYBODY 

9091
05:53:13,504 --> 05:53:14,172
THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ESSENTIALLY 

9092
05:53:14,172 --> 05:53:14,806
BOWED TO PARTY LOYALTY EARLIER 

9093
05:53:14,806 --> 05:53:15,173
ON IN THE DAY. 

9094
05:53:15,173 --> 05:53:15,706
MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN 

9095
05:53:15,706 --> 05:53:16,307
VIGOROUS IN SUGGESTING THAT 

9096
05:53:16,307 --> 05:53:16,908
JUDGE KAVANAUGH NEEDS TO BE 

9097
05:53:16,908 --> 05:53:17,575
CONFIRMED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. 

9098
05:53:17,575 --> 05:53:18,109
BUT DOES THIS MAKE IT 

9099
05:53:18,109 --> 05:53:18,776
POLITICALLY UNTENABLE TO DO SO 

9100
05:53:18,776 --> 05:53:19,377
WITHOUT THE ONE WEEK DELAY? 

9101
05:53:19,377 --> 05:53:19,777
I THINK IT DOES. 

9102
05:53:19,777 --> 05:53:20,411
JEFF FLAKE APPEARS TO SUGGEST 

9103
05:53:20,411 --> 05:53:21,045
THAT HE WILL NOT VOTE UNLESS 

9104
05:53:21,045 --> 05:53:21,479
THE DELAY HAPPENS. 

9105
05:53:21,479 --> 05:53:22,146
IF JEFF FLAKE DOES NOT GO TO 

9106
05:53:22,146 --> 05:53:22,747
CONFIRM, I DO NOT SEE WHY 

9107
05:53:22,747 --> 05:53:23,347
COLLINS OR MAKOWSKI WOULD. 

9108
05:53:23,347 --> 05:53:23,981
CEMENT WE HEARD SENATOR LINDSEY 

9109
05:53:23,981 --> 05:53:24,482
GRAHAM SOFTEN HIS TONE. 

9110
05:53:24,482 --> 05:53:25,149
IT WAS DIFFERENT 24 HOURS AGO. 

9111
05:53:25,149 --> 05:53:25,783
SPENT EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT 

9112
05:53:25,783 --> 05:53:26,317
TRUMP MAY NOT HAVE FULLY 

9113
05:53:26,317 --> 05:53:26,984
GRASPED WHAT IS GOING ON, THAT 

9114
05:53:26,984 --> 05:53:27,685
WAS A MUCH MORE MUTED TONE THAT 

9115
05:53:27,685 --> 05:53:28,352
WE HAVE HEARD FROM HIM OVER THE 

9116
05:53:28,352 --> 05:53:28,853
PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. 

9117
05:53:28,853 --> 05:53:29,453
IT IS CLEARLY A VERY FEBRILE 

9118
05:53:29,453 --> 05:53:29,754
ATMOSPHERE. 

9119
05:53:29,754 --> 05:53:30,154
ONE FINAL POINT. 

9120
05:53:30,154 --> 05:53:30,788
IT IS NOT JUST THE FACT THAT 

9121
05:53:30,788 --> 05:53:31,422
THERE IS THE ALLEGATIONS FROM 

9122
05:53:31,422 --> 05:53:32,123
DR. FOR THAT MADE THEM WANT TO 

9123
05:53:32,123 --> 05:53:32,824
GET IT OVER AND DONE WITH THAT 

9124
05:53:32,824 --> 05:53:33,457
BUT THE FEAR THAT THE LONGER 

9125
05:53:33,457 --> 05:53:34,091
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH HANGS OUT 

9126
05:53:34,091 --> 05:53:34,659
THERE THE MORE ALLEGATIONS 

9127
05:53:34,659 --> 05:53:35,126
COULD COME FORWARD. 

9128
05:53:35,126 --> 05:53:35,726
THE MORE THAT THE OTHER TWO 

9129
05:53:35,726 --> 05:53:36,394
WOMEN THAT HAVE MADE SEPARATE 

9130
05:53:36,394 --> 05:53:37,028
ALLEGATIONS COULD DEMAND THEIR 

9131
05:53:37,028 --> 05:53:37,728
MOMENT IN FRONT OF SOME FORM OF 

9132
05:53:37,728 --> 05:53:38,029
TESTIMONY. 

9133
05:53:38,029 --> 05:53:38,663
SO ALL OF THE PROBLEMS JUST 

9134
05:53:38,663 --> 05:53:38,930
MULTIPLY. 

9135
05:53:38,930 --> 05:53:39,530
MITCH McCONNELL CERTAINLY HAS 

9136
05:53:39,530 --> 05:53:40,064
GOT A HEADACHE AT BEST. 

9137
05:53:40,064 --> 05:53:40,598
>> I AM LOOKING AT THE 

9138
05:53:40,598 --> 05:53:40,865
CALENDAR. 

9139
05:53:40,865 --> 05:53:41,365
WE HAVE GOT A MONTH. 

9140
05:53:41,365 --> 05:53:41,866
WE HAVE GOT A MONTH. 

9141
05:53:41,866 --> 05:53:42,533
THE SUPREME COURT IS SEATED ON 

9142
05:53:42,533 --> 05:53:42,767
MONDAY. 

9143
05:53:42,767 --> 05:53:43,367
IT IS THE LAST FRIDAY IN 

9144
05:53:43,367 --> 05:53:43,668
SEPTEMBER. 

9145
05:53:43,668 --> 05:53:44,235
WE HAVE GOT FOUR WEEKS. 

9146
05:53:44,235 --> 05:53:44,869
THERE IS NO PLAN B THAT THE 

9147
05:53:44,869 --> 05:53:45,570
WHITE HOUSE HAS SAID IF HE DOES 

9148
05:53:45,570 --> 05:53:45,970
NOT GO THROUGH. 

9149
05:53:45,970 --> 05:53:46,637
>> Reporter: LET'S UNPACK A BIT 

9150
05:53:46,637 --> 05:53:47,305
OF THIS BUT IT WAS NOT EVEN THE 

9151
05:53:47,305 --> 05:53:47,972
CHANGE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF 

9152
05:53:47,972 --> 05:53:48,639
LINDSEY GRAHAM BUT IN THE LAST 

9153
05:53:48,639 --> 05:53:48,940
FEW HOURS. 

9154
05:53:48,940 --> 05:53:49,607
WE STARTED THIS MORNING AND IT 

9155
05:53:49,607 --> 05:53:50,274
WAS MUCH MORE HOSTILE, KIND OF 

9156
05:53:50,274 --> 05:53:50,842
BRISTLING AT THE IDEA OF 

9157
05:53:50,842 --> 05:53:51,509
SLOWING THE MOMENTUM AND WE ARE 

9158
05:53:51,509 --> 05:53:52,176
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD 100 MILES 

9159
05:53:52,176 --> 05:53:52,844
PER HOUR TO HAVE THIS VOTE.  

9160
05:53:52,844 --> 05:53:53,544
REGARDLESS OF WHO IS WITH US OR 

9161
05:53:53,544 --> 05:53:53,744
NOT. 

9162
05:53:53,744 --> 05:53:54,412
DR. FORD WAS GIVEN TO HER DUE, 

9163
05:53:54,412 --> 05:53:55,079
CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY AND 

9164
05:53:55,079 --> 05:53:55,746
LET'S GO AHEAD AND PROCEED WITH 

9165
05:53:55,746 --> 05:53:56,414
IT IT WAS -- IT IS THE FEMALE 

9166
05:53:56,414 --> 05:53:57,048
CENTERS THAT SAID, WHAT WOULD 

9167
05:53:57,048 --> 05:53:57,715
AN FBI INVESTIGATION INTO THIS 

9168
05:53:57,715 --> 05:53:58,349
ISSUE -- IT WOULD CERTAINLY 

9169
05:53:58,349 --> 05:53:58,883
ILLUMINATE AND IT WOULD 

9170
05:53:58,883 --> 05:53:59,550
CERTAINLY HELP AND THEN COLLINS 

9171
05:53:59,550 --> 05:54:00,218
-- THERE IS SOME REPORTING, I 

9172
05:54:00,218 --> 05:54:00,852
DO NOT KNOW HOW TO, SAY THAT 

9173
05:54:00,852 --> 05:54:01,452
THEY WERE A BIT CONCERNED AT 

9174
05:54:01,452 --> 05:54:02,086
THE TONE AND TEMPERAMENT THAT 

9175
05:54:02,086 --> 05:54:02,587
THE JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAD 

9176
05:54:02,587 --> 05:54:03,187
YESTERDAY DEFENDING HIMSELF. 

9177
05:54:03,187 --> 05:54:03,821
THERE IS THE IDEA THAT THERE 

9178
05:54:03,821 --> 05:54:04,388
ARE TWO SIDES OF IT BRETT 

9179
05:54:04,388 --> 05:54:05,022
KAVANAUGH WHEN HE DRINKS AND 

9180
05:54:05,022 --> 05:54:05,456
WHEN HE DOES NOT. 

9181
05:54:05,456 --> 05:54:06,123
THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES CAUSING

9182
05:54:06,123 --> 05:54:06,791
PAUSE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE 

9183
05:54:06,791 --> 05:54:07,425
SAYING THAT TONE, THAT SIGNAL 

9184
05:54:07,425 --> 05:54:08,125
THAT IT IS SENDING THAT IT IS 

9185
05:54:08,125 --> 05:54:08,492
SERIOUS ENOUGH. 

9186
05:54:08,492 --> 05:54:09,126
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE WAY THAT 

9187
05:54:09,126 --> 05:54:09,794
HE WOULD VOTE ON AN ISSUE BUT 

9188
05:54:09,794 --> 05:54:10,461
THIS IS PERSONAL CHARACTER AND 

9189
05:54:10,461 --> 05:54:11,062
TEMPERAMENT AND JUST TAKING 

9190
05:54:11,062 --> 05:54:11,762
ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT 

9191
05:54:11,762 --> 05:54:12,263
THIS IS REALLY BEEN A 

9192
05:54:12,263 --> 05:54:12,830
THOROUGHLY DOING THEIR DUE 

9193
05:54:12,830 --> 05:54:13,497
DILIGENCE WILL GIVE COMFORT TO 

9194
05:54:13,497 --> 05:54:14,165
A LOT OF EVEN REPUBLICANS LIKE 

9195
05:54:14,165 --> 05:54:14,832
MYSELF WHO ARE REALLY CONCERNED 

9196
05:54:14,832 --> 05:54:15,132
ABOUT THAT. 

9197
05:54:15,132 --> 05:54:15,733
>> WE ARE GETTING INFORMATION 

9198
05:54:15,733 --> 05:54:16,367
ABOUT SENATOR MURKOWSKI AND HE 

9199
05:54:16,367 --> 05:54:17,068
IS SAYING THEY -- SHE SAYS THAT 

9200
05:54:17,068 --> 05:54:17,735
SHE SUPPORTS SAYING  THEY -- 

9201
05:54:17,735 --> 05:54:18,169
DELAYING THAT VOTE. 

9202
05:54:18,169 --> 05:54:18,836
DO WE KNOW IF SHE IS IN FAVOR 

9203
05:54:18,836 --> 05:54:19,403
OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION? 

9204
05:54:19,403 --> 05:54:20,037
WE DO NOT KNOW IF SHE IS IN 

9205
05:54:20,037 --> 05:54:20,705
FAVOR OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 

9206
05:54:20,705 --> 05:54:21,372
WE ARE HEARING THAT SHE IS IN 

9207
05:54:21,372 --> 05:54:22,006
FAVOR OF DELAYING THE VOTE. 

9208
05:54:22,006 --> 05:54:22,473
I WANT TO ASK YOU. 

9209
05:54:22,473 --> 05:54:23,140
LESLIE WAS TALKING ABOUT TOWN. 

9210
05:54:23,140 --> 05:54:23,841
THE PHRASE THAT I HAVE FROM THE 

9211
05:54:23,841 --> 05:54:24,475
PRESIDENT IS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT 

9212
05:54:24,475 --> 05:54:25,142
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS, WHAT IS 

9213
05:54:25,142 --> 05:54:25,610
THE MESSAGE YOU HAVE? 

9214
05:54:25,610 --> 05:54:26,310
I HAVE NO MESSAGE THEY HAVE TO 

9215
05:54:26,310 --> 05:54:27,044
DO WHAT IS RIGHT THAT STRUCK ME 

9216
05:54:27,044 --> 05:54:27,578
AS SUCH A DIFFERENT TONE? 

9217
05:54:27,578 --> 05:54:28,246
MAKE IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY 

9218
05:54:28,246 --> 05:54:28,846
HAS BEEN IN HIS EAR A LITTLE 

9219
05:54:28,846 --> 05:54:29,447
BIT AND TELLING HIM THAT THE 

9220
05:54:29,447 --> 05:54:30,081
BEST THING RIGHT NOW IS NOT A 

9221
05:54:30,081 --> 05:54:30,748
DONALD TRUMP TWEETING STORM OR 

9222
05:54:30,748 --> 05:54:31,382
INTENSE PRESSURE BUT THESE ARE 

9223
05:54:31,382 --> 05:54:31,949
VERY -- WE SAW HOW QUICKLY 

9224
05:54:31,949 --> 05:54:32,583
WITHIN 30 MINUTES THIS CHANGED 

9225
05:54:32,583 --> 05:54:33,217
INSIDE THE COMMITTEE ROOM FOR 

9226
05:54:33,217 --> 05:54:33,784
THESE ARE VERY, VERY TENSE 

9227
05:54:33,784 --> 05:54:34,051
MOMENTS. 

9228
05:54:34,051 --> 05:54:34,619
THEY ARE VERY HIGH-STAKES 

9229
05:54:34,619 --> 05:54:35,019
THINGS GOING ON. 

9230
05:54:35,019 --> 05:54:35,653
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE VERY 

9231
05:54:35,653 --> 05:54:36,287
CAREFUL WITH HIS RHETORIC AND 

9232
05:54:36,287 --> 05:54:36,654
WITH HIS TONE. 

9233
05:54:36,654 --> 05:54:37,355
A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WANT 

9234
05:54:37,355 --> 05:54:37,722
TO POINT OUT. 

9235
05:54:37,722 --> 05:54:37,922
TIME. 

9236
05:54:37,922 --> 05:54:38,589
YOU BROUGHT UP TIME EARLIER BUT 

9237
05:54:38,589 --> 05:54:39,156
TIME IS NOT THE FRIEND OF 

9238
05:54:39,156 --> 05:54:39,824
SENATE REPUBLICANS THAT BELIEVE 

9239
05:54:39,824 --> 05:54:40,491
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE 

9240
05:54:40,491 --> 05:54:40,992
ON THE SUPREME COURT. 

9241
05:54:40,992 --> 05:54:41,626
I BROUGHT THIS UP YESTERDAY. 

9242
05:54:41,626 --> 05:54:42,260
I WAS IN THE SENATE WHEN WE 

9243
05:54:42,260 --> 05:54:42,827
WENT THROUGH THIS WITH A 

9244
05:54:42,827 --> 05:54:43,427
DIFFERENT ISSUE, HEALTHCARE, 

9245
05:54:43,427 --> 05:54:44,128
AND 20 -- AND WHAT WE FOUND IS 

9246
05:54:44,128 --> 05:54:44,695
THAT MORE TIME DID NOT DO 

9247
05:54:44,695 --> 05:54:45,329
ANYTHING TO HELP US PASS THE 

9248
05:54:45,329 --> 05:54:45,997
BILL THAT WE WANT TO DO PASS. 

9249
05:54:45,997 --> 05:54:46,697
IT WATERED IT DOWN AND IT ENDED 

9250
05:54:46,697 --> 05:54:47,365
UP HURTING US IN THE FOLLOWING 

9251
05:54:47,365 --> 05:54:47,798
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

9252
05:54:47,798 --> 05:54:48,466
IF YOU REMEMBER, THIS WAS SCOTT 

9253
05:54:48,466 --> 05:54:49,066
BROWN REPLACING TED KENNEDY. 

9254
05:54:49,066 --> 05:54:49,600
THAT WAS A BAD CYCLE FOR 

9255
05:54:49,600 --> 05:54:49,901
DEMOCRATS. 

9256
05:54:49,901 --> 05:54:50,501
IN PART, PART OF WHY THAT 

9257
05:54:50,501 --> 05:54:51,068
HAPPENED IS BECAUSE TIME 

9258
05:54:51,068 --> 05:54:51,702
DRAGGED OUT AND THERE WAS MORE 

9259
05:54:51,702 --> 05:54:52,270
BAD STUFF ABOUT THE BILL. 

9260
05:54:52,270 --> 05:54:52,970
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE NACVE TO 

9261
05:54:52,970 --> 05:54:53,671
THINK THAT ONLY GOOD THINGS ARE 

9262
05:54:53,671 --> 05:54:54,305
GOING TO COME OUT ABOUT BRETT 

9263
05:54:54,305 --> 05:54:54,972
KAVANAUGH IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 

9264
05:54:54,972 --> 05:54:55,673
JUST IN THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN 

9265
05:54:55,673 --> 05:54:56,274
HERE, ANOTHER BIG STORY THAT 

9266
05:54:56,274 --> 05:54:56,874
CAME OUT, TALKING ABOUT WHAT 

9267
05:54:56,874 --> 05:54:57,508
SENATE REPUBLICAN STAFFERS DUE 

9268
05:54:57,508 --> 05:54:58,175
TO POTENTIALLY GUM UP THE WORKS 

9269
05:54:58,175 --> 05:54:58,843
IN TERMS OF MORE ACCUSERS OR 

9270
05:54:58,843 --> 05:54:59,377
MORE CONCERNS ABOUT BRETT 

9271
05:54:59,377 --> 05:54:59,877
KAVANAUGH BEING HEARD. 

9272
05:54:59,877 --> 05:55:00,478
TIME IS NOT THE FRIEND OF 

9273
05:55:00,478 --> 05:55:01,112
REPUBLICANS AND THE LAST THING 

9274
05:55:01,112 --> 05:55:01,712
THAT I WILL SAY IS GANGS. 

9275
05:55:01,712 --> 05:55:02,079
GANG OF FOUR. 

9276
05:55:02,079 --> 05:55:02,713
IT IS NOT JUST JEFF FLAKE. 

9277
05:55:02,713 --> 05:55:03,314
JEFF FLAKE HAS THE POLITICAL 

9278
05:55:03,314 --> 05:55:03,948
CAPITAL --  HE IS THE ONLY 

9279
05:55:03,948 --> 05:55:04,582
PERSON UP THERE BUT IT IS NOT 

9280
05:55:04,582 --> 05:55:05,216
COINCIDENTAL THAT JEFF FLAKE 

9281
05:55:05,216 --> 05:55:05,883
DOES NOT HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION 

9282
05:55:05,883 --> 05:55:06,584
TO GO BACK ON THE BALLOT BOX. 

9283
05:55:06,584 --> 05:55:07,118
THESE OTHER SENATORS ARE 

9284
05:55:07,118 --> 05:55:07,785
DEPENDING ON HIM TO GIVE THEM 

9285
05:55:07,785 --> 05:55:08,486
THE COVER, THE AIR COVER, TO BE 

9286
05:55:08,486 --> 05:55:09,120
ABLE TO HAVE THIS POSITION. 

9287
05:55:09,120 --> 05:55:09,754
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO 

9288
05:55:09,754 --> 05:55:10,087
NOTE AS WELL. 

9289
05:55:10,087 --> 05:55:10,554
>> THAT IS WHERE THE 

9290
05:55:10,554 --> 05:55:11,222
RELATIONSHIPS MATTER A TIDE IN 

9291
05:55:11,222 --> 05:55:11,522
THE SENATE. 

9292
05:55:11,522 --> 05:55:12,123
JEFF FLAKE DOES NOT HAVE A 

9293
05:55:12,123 --> 05:55:12,790
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT 

9294
05:55:12,790 --> 05:55:13,057
AT ALL. 

9295
05:55:13,057 --> 05:55:13,658
YOU CAN SAY IT IS NEGATIVE. 

9296
05:55:13,658 --> 05:55:14,258
IN FACT, HE HAS BEEN A TOP 

9297
05:55:14,258 --> 05:55:14,859
CRITIC OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH 

9298
05:55:14,859 --> 05:55:15,493
IS WHY IT WAS SO REMARKABLE 

9299
05:55:15,493 --> 05:55:16,160
THIS MORNING WHEN HE CAME OUT 

9300
05:55:16,160 --> 05:55:16,827
WITH THAT NO VOTE AND REMEMBER 

9301
05:55:16,827 --> 05:55:17,495
THE VIDEO THAT WAS PLAYING OF 

9302
05:55:17,495 --> 05:55:18,129
THE PROTESTER CORNERING HIM IN 

9303
05:55:18,129 --> 05:55:18,462
THE ELEVATOR. 

9304
05:55:18,462 --> 05:55:19,096
YOU COULD SENSING HER VOICE AND 

9305
05:55:19,096 --> 05:55:19,764
WHAT SHE WAS SAYING TO HIM HOW 

9306
05:55:19,764 --> 05:55:20,298
EMOTIONAL THIS IS EVER 

9307
05:55:20,298 --> 05:55:20,932
QUESTIONS TO HIM ARE QUESTIONS 

9308
05:55:20,932 --> 05:55:21,565
THAT A LOT OF WOMEN IN THIS 

9309
05:55:21,565 --> 05:55:22,199
COUNTRY HAVE BEEN PUTTING TO 

9310
05:55:22,199 --> 05:55:22,667
LAWMAKERS ELSEWHERE. 

9311
05:55:22,667 --> 05:55:23,367
CLEARLY THAT MOMENT RAISED SOME 

9312
05:55:23,367 --> 05:55:23,668
QUESTIONS. 

9313
05:55:23,668 --> 05:55:24,235
POLITICALLY SPEAKING, THE 

9314
05:55:24,235 --> 05:55:24,835
QUESTION THAT I HAD YESTERDAY 

9315
05:55:24,835 --> 05:55:25,436
WAS WHY BRETT KAVANAUGH WOULD 

9316
05:55:25,436 --> 05:55:26,003
NOT JUST AGREE TO AN FBI 

9317
05:55:26,003 --> 05:55:26,370
INVESTIGATION. 

9318
05:55:26,370 --> 05:55:26,938
REPUBLICANS ESPECIALLY A 

9319
05:55:26,938 --> 05:55:27,605
REPUBLICAN LIKE JEFF FLAKE, FOR 

9320
05:55:27,605 --> 05:55:28,272
WHOM THE SUPREME COURT IS A KEY 

9321
05:55:28,272 --> 05:55:28,839
ISSUE -- I MEAN, HE IS A 

9322
05:55:28,839 --> 05:55:29,507
TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE AS FAR 

9323
05:55:29,507 --> 05:55:30,174
AS THE COURTS ARE CONCERNED IN 

9324
05:55:30,174 --> 05:55:30,608
SOME OTHER ISSUES. 

9325
05:55:30,608 --> 05:55:31,075
WHY NOT HAVE THE FBI 

9326
05:55:31,075 --> 05:55:31,709
INVESTIGATION TO ALLEVIATE ANY 

9327
05:55:31,709 --> 05:55:32,376
QUESTIONS THAT THE PUBLIC MIGHT 

9328
05:55:32,376 --> 05:55:32,576
HAVE? 

9329
05:55:32,576 --> 05:55:33,210
EVEN IF THEY ARE INCONCLUSIVE? 

9330
05:55:33,210 --> 05:55:33,844
AT LEAST SAYING THAT WE DID 

9331
05:55:33,844 --> 05:55:34,545
EVERYTHING WE DID WE COULD TO 

9332
05:55:34,545 --> 05:55:35,146
TRY TO INVESTIGATE THIS AND 

9333
05:55:35,146 --> 05:55:35,746
THIS IS THE INFORMATION WE 

9334
05:55:35,746 --> 05:55:35,947
HAVE. 

9335
05:55:35,947 --> 05:55:36,480
WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. 

9336
05:55:36,480 --> 05:55:37,114
POLITICALLY SPEAKING, IT SEEMS 

9337
05:55:37,114 --> 05:55:37,615
TO BE AN ADVANTAGE FOR 

9338
05:55:37,615 --> 05:55:38,282
REPUBLICANS IF THEY ARE TO GO 

9339
05:55:38,282 --> 05:55:38,716
AHEAD AND DO THIS. 

9340
05:55:38,716 --> 05:55:39,383
>> WE WERE TALKING A LITTLE BIT 

9341
05:55:39,383 --> 05:55:40,017
ABOUT LEVERAGE AND PRESSURE. 

9342
05:55:40,017 --> 05:55:40,618
I WOULD LOVE TO ASK SENATOR 

9343
05:55:40,618 --> 05:55:41,218
FLAKE TODAY EXACTLY HOW MUCH 

9344
05:55:41,218 --> 05:55:41,919
THE PROTESTERS IN THAT ELEVATOR 

9345
05:55:41,919 --> 05:55:42,586
MAY HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I WANT 

9346
05:55:42,586 --> 05:55:43,220
TO PLAY YOU THE VIDEO THAT OUR 

9347
05:55:43,220 --> 05:55:43,854
PRODUCER ON CAPITOL HILL GOT. 

9348
05:55:43,854 --> 05:55:44,555
EXPECT I -- I TOLD THE STORY OF 

9349
05:55:44,555 --> 05:55:45,022
MY SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

9350
05:55:45,022 --> 05:55:45,456
TELLING THE TRUTH. 

9351
05:55:45,456 --> 05:55:46,123
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING 

9352
05:55:46,123 --> 05:55:46,691
SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY 

9353
05:55:46,691 --> 05:55:47,358
VIOLATED A WOMAN TO SIT IN THE 

9354
05:55:47,358 --> 05:55:47,725
SUPREME COURT. 

9355
05:55:47,725 --> 05:55:48,225
THIS IS NOT TOLERABLE. 

9356
05:55:48,225 --> 05:55:48,859
YOU HAVE CHILDREN. THINK ABOUT 

9357
05:55:48,859 --> 05:55:49,060
THEM. 

9358
05:55:49,060 --> 05:55:49,527
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN. 

9359
05:55:49,527 --> 05:55:50,161
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT FOR THE 

9360
05:55:50,161 --> 05:55:50,861
NEXT 50 YEARS, THEY WILL HAVE 

9361
05:55:50,861 --> 05:55:51,462
SOMEBODY IN THE SUPREME COURT 

9362
05:55:51,462 --> 05:55:52,029
THAT HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF 

9363
05:55:52,029 --> 05:55:52,596
VIOLATING THAT YOUNG GIRL. 

9364
05:55:52,596 --> 05:55:53,164
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR? 

9365
05:55:53,164 --> 05:55:53,664
>> NOBODY BELIEVED ME. 

9366
05:55:53,664 --> 05:55:54,298
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE AND YOU 

9367
05:55:54,298 --> 05:55:54,966
ARE TELLING ALL WOMEN THAT THEY 

9368
05:55:54,966 --> 05:55:55,299
DON'T MATTER. 

9369
05:55:55,299 --> 05:55:55,900
THAT THEY SHOULD STAY QUIET 

9370
05:55:55,900 --> 05:55:56,567
BECAUSE IF THEY TELL YOU WHAT 

9371
05:55:56,567 --> 05:55:57,234
HAPPENED TO THEM, YOU ARE GOING 

9372
05:55:57,234 --> 05:55:57,601
TO IGNORE THEM. 

9373
05:55:57,601 --> 05:55:58,302
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND 

9374
05:55:58,302 --> 05:55:58,903
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE TELLING 

9375
05:55:58,903 --> 05:55:59,403
ALL WOMEN IN AMERICA. 

9376
05:55:59,403 --> 05:56:00,037
>> HE STOOD THERE IN SILENCE 

9377
05:56:00,037 --> 05:56:00,671
LISTENING AND THEN HE MADE A 

9378
05:56:00,671 --> 05:56:01,105
DRAMATIC REVERSAL. 

9379
05:56:01,105 --> 05:56:01,672
>> Reporter: I HAVE BEEN 

9380
05:56:01,672 --> 05:56:02,340
SPEAKING  WITH MEMBERS ON THE 

9381
05:56:02,340 --> 05:56:02,840
OTHER SIDE AND WE HAD 

9382
05:56:02,840 --> 05:56:03,441
CONVERSATIONS GOING ON WITH 

9383
05:56:03,441 --> 05:56:04,141
REGARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE 

9384
05:56:04,141 --> 05:56:04,575
DO DUE DILIGENCE. 

9385
05:56:04,575 --> 05:56:05,242
I THINK IT WOULD BE PROPER TO 

9386
05:56:05,242 --> 05:56:05,876
DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE IN ORDER 

9387
05:56:05,876 --> 05:56:06,544
TO LET THE FBI CONTINUE TO DO 

9388
05:56:06,544 --> 05:56:07,144
AN INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN 

9389
05:56:07,144 --> 05:56:07,778
TIME AND SCOPE TO THE CURRENT 

9390
05:56:07,778 --> 05:56:08,412
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THE AND 

9391
05:56:08,412 --> 05:56:09,080
LIMIT IT IN TIME TO NO MORE 

9392
05:56:09,080 --> 05:56:09,447
THAN ONE WEEK. 

9393
05:56:09,447 --> 05:56:10,047
I WOULD VOTE TO ADVANCE THE 

9394
05:56:10,047 --> 05:56:10,681
BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT 

9395
05:56:10,681 --> 05:56:11,048
UNDERSTANDING. 

9396
05:56:11,048 --> 05:56:11,682
I HAVE SPOKEN TO A FEW OTHER 

9397
05:56:11,682 --> 05:56:12,416
MEMBERS ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE 

9398
05:56:12,416 --> 05:56:13,084
THAT MAY BE SUPPORTIVE AS WELL. 

9399
05:56:13,084 --> 05:56:13,551
THAT IS MY POSITION. 

9400
05:56:13,551 --> 05:56:14,185
I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO DO 

9401
05:56:14,185 --> 05:56:14,852
WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT 

9402
05:56:14,852 --> 05:56:15,519
WE DO ALL DUE DILIGENCE WITH A 

9403
05:56:15,519 --> 05:56:16,153
NOMINATION THIS IMPORTANT AND I 

9404
05:56:16,153 --> 05:56:16,821
WANT TO SAY THAT THIS COMMITTEE 

9405
05:56:16,821 --> 05:56:17,388
HAS ACTED PROPERLY AND THE 

9406
05:56:17,388 --> 05:56:17,922
CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER 

9407
05:56:17,922 --> 05:56:18,589
BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS 

9408
05:56:18,589 --> 05:56:19,223
FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND TO DELAY

9409
05:56:19,223 --> 05:56:19,924
THIS VOTE IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR 

9410
05:56:19,924 --> 05:56:20,591
A WEEK SO THAT DR. FORD COULD 

9411
05:56:20,591 --> 05:56:21,258
BE HEARD AND SHE WAS YESTERDAY. 

9412
05:56:21,258 --> 05:56:21,993
SO THAT -- WITH THAT AGREEMENT, 

9413
05:56:21,993 --> 05:56:22,660
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL 

9414
05:56:22,660 --> 05:56:23,027
TO THE FLOOR. 

9415
05:56:23,027 --> 05:56:23,728
>> WE ARE LEARNING THAT SENATOR 

9416
05:56:23,728 --> 05:56:24,328
MURKOWSKI, LISA MURKOWSKI IS, 

9417
05:56:24,328 --> 05:56:24,996
IN FACT, BEHIND SENATOR FLAKE, 

9418
05:56:24,996 --> 05:56:25,663
SAYING THAT SHE DOES SUPPORT A 

9419
05:56:25,663 --> 05:56:26,364
DELAY BUT WE DO NOT KNOW IF SHE 

9420
05:56:26,364 --> 05:56:27,031
SUPPORTS AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

9421
05:56:27,031 --> 05:56:27,565
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 

9422
05:56:27,565 --> 05:56:28,099
OPTICS AND THE POLITICS. 

9423
05:56:28,099 --> 05:56:28,666
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? 

9424
05:56:28,666 --> 05:56:29,333
>> WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS 

9425
05:56:29,333 --> 05:56:29,867
THE SCIENCE FROM SENATOR 

9426
05:56:29,867 --> 05:56:30,501
COLLINS, THE THIRD REPUBLICAN 

9427
05:56:30,501 --> 05:56:30,835
THAT IS HERE. 

9428
05:56:30,835 --> 05:56:31,435
I THINK THAT REALLY, THE KEY 

9429
05:56:31,435 --> 05:56:31,969
THING IS, ARE REPUBLICANS 

9430
05:56:31,969 --> 05:56:32,603
INCLUDING MR. McCONNELL GOING TO

9431
05:56:32,603 --> 05:56:33,170
ACCEDE TO THIS DEMAND? 

9432
05:56:33,170 --> 05:56:33,804
I DO NOT SEE HOW THEY CANNOT. 

9433
05:56:33,804 --> 05:56:34,472
THIS INVESTIGATION HAS TO TAKE 

9434
05:56:34,472 --> 05:56:34,872
PLACE FOR A WEEK. 

9435
05:56:34,872 --> 05:56:35,473
IT IS JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY 

9436
05:56:35,473 --> 05:56:36,140
ROLLER COASTER THAT WE ARE ON 

9437
05:56:36,140 --> 05:56:36,741
WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO 

9438
05:56:36,741 --> 05:56:37,141
PREDICT ANYTHING. 

9439
05:56:37,141 --> 05:56:37,775
ROUGHLY 24 HOURS AGO AFTER DR. 

9440
05:56:37,775 --> 05:56:38,409
FORD FINISHED TESTIFYING I WAS 

9441
05:56:38,409 --> 05:56:39,010
SPEAKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE 

9442
05:56:39,010 --> 05:56:39,610
DONALD TRUMP LOYALISTS THAT 

9443
05:56:39,610 --> 05:56:40,177
WERE CONCERNED WITH BRETT 

9444
05:56:40,177 --> 05:56:40,611
KAVANAUGH'S FATE. 

9445
05:56:40,611 --> 05:56:41,212
SIX HOURS LATER, FOUR HOURS 

9446
05:56:41,212 --> 05:56:41,846
LATER THEY WERE BULLISH ABOUT 

9447
05:56:41,846 --> 05:56:42,380
IT AFTER HE TESTIFIED. 

9448
05:56:42,380 --> 05:56:43,047
TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE JEFF FLAKE 

9449
05:56:43,047 --> 05:56:43,681
WAS FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH AND NOW 

9450
05:56:43,681 --> 05:56:44,315
HE IS PULLING BACK FROM THAT. 

9451
05:56:44,315 --> 05:56:45,016
HOW MANY TWISTS ARE WE GOING TO 

9452
05:56:45,016 --> 05:56:45,449
HAPPEN THIS TALE? 

9453
05:56:45,449 --> 05:56:45,983
>> NO MATTER WHAT, WILL 

9454
05:56:45,983 --> 05:56:46,584
REPUBLICANS ULTIMATELY WIN? 

9455
05:56:46,584 --> 05:56:47,218
IF A BRETT KAVANAUGH MAKES IT 

9456
05:56:47,218 --> 05:56:47,885
TO THE COURT, THEY WIN AND IF 

9457
05:56:47,885 --> 05:56:48,486
HE DOES NOT, DOES IT THEN 

9458
05:56:48,486 --> 05:56:49,153
MOBILIZE THEIR BASE TO GET OUT 

9459
05:56:49,153 --> 05:56:49,487
IN NOVEMBER? 

9460
05:56:49,487 --> 05:56:49,754
>> I DO. 

9461
05:56:49,754 --> 05:56:50,254
I THINK THAT IT DOES 

9462
05:56:50,254 --> 05:56:50,554
ABSOLUTELY. 

9463
05:56:50,554 --> 05:56:51,122
I THINK THAT THERE ARE BIG 

9464
05:56:51,122 --> 05:56:51,422
POSITIVES. 

9465
05:56:51,422 --> 05:56:52,123
I AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT TIME 

9466
05:56:52,123 --> 05:56:52,723
KILLS DEALS AND IT WORKS AND 

9467
05:56:52,723 --> 05:56:53,357
THIS IS THAT WE, TOO BUT WHAT 

9468
05:56:53,357 --> 05:56:54,058
WOMEN NEED IS TO FEEL HURT BUT 

9469
05:56:54,058 --> 05:56:54,392
WE KNOW THIS. 

9470
05:56:54,392 --> 05:56:55,026
SENSITIVITY TRAINING, EVERYONE, 

9471
05:56:55,026 --> 05:56:55,526
IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW. 

9472
05:56:55,526 --> 05:56:56,260
THEY NEED TO FEEL HURT BUT MORE 

9473
05:56:56,260 --> 05:56:56,894
IMPORTANTLY THEY LIKE TO DO 

9474
05:56:56,894 --> 05:56:57,395
THEIR OWN THING -- DUE 

9475
05:56:57,395 --> 05:56:58,062
DILIGENCE AND THEY LIKE A THIRD 

9476
05:56:58,062 --> 05:56:58,696
PARTY SOURCE WHEN YOU TALK TO 

9477
05:56:58,696 --> 05:56:59,230
VOTERS AND TEMPERAMENT. 

9478
05:56:59,230 --> 05:56:59,997
THEY WANT TO KNOW IS THAT -- IT 

9479
05:56:59,997 --> 05:57:00,598
IS OUTSIDE OF THE POLITICAL 

9480
05:57:00,598 --> 05:57:00,865
PROCESS. 

9481
05:57:00,865 --> 05:57:01,332
THE FBI IS THE KEY. 

9482
05:57:01,332 --> 05:57:01,899
THEY ARE GOING TO PRESENT 

9483
05:57:01,899 --> 05:57:02,500
EVIDENCE BUT LET'S SAY THAT 

9484
05:57:02,500 --> 05:57:03,100
THEY COME FORWARD AND SAY WE 

9485
05:57:03,100 --> 05:57:03,667
HAVE READ IT AND SEEN IT 

9486
05:57:03,667 --> 05:57:04,168
PRIVATELY AND WE HAVE 

9487
05:57:04,168 --> 05:57:04,668
CONFIDENCE THAT HE IS 

9488
05:57:04,668 --> 05:57:04,969
QUALIFIED. 

9489
05:57:04,969 --> 05:57:05,603
THERE WILL BE A BIG SIGH OF 

9490
05:57:05,603 --> 05:57:06,303
RELIEF AND PEOPLE SAY, OKAY, WE 

9491
05:57:06,303 --> 05:57:06,771
TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT. 

9492
05:57:06,771 --> 05:57:07,304
YOU LOOK AT INDEPENDENT 

9493
05:57:07,304 --> 05:57:07,972
RESEARCH AND HUMAN FARMER WITH 

9494
05:57:07,972 --> 05:57:08,372
THE CONFIRMATION. 

9495
05:57:08,372 --> 05:57:09,006
THERE WILL BE A MUCH BETTER 

9496
05:57:09,006 --> 05:57:09,673
SUPPORT LAID OUT FOR THE JUDGE. 

9497
05:57:09,673 --> 05:57:10,174
IF YOU ROLLTHAT BACK, 

9498
05:57:10,174 --> 05:57:10,841
CONVERSELY, IF THEY SEE THIS 

9499
05:57:10,841 --> 05:57:11,509
INFORMATION AND PULL AWAY, THAT 

9500
05:57:11,509 --> 05:57:12,143
THEY WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 

9501
05:57:12,143 --> 05:57:12,510
THAT AS WELL. 

9502
05:57:12,510 --> 05:57:13,110
>> I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE A 

9503
05:57:13,110 --> 05:57:13,344
POINT. 

9504
05:57:13,344 --> 05:57:13,878
AS LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID, 

9505
05:57:13,878 --> 05:57:14,478
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO EXPLAIN 

9506
05:57:14,478 --> 05:57:15,046
THIS TO DONALD TRUMP WHEN 

9507
05:57:15,046 --> 05:57:15,713
SOMEBODY EXPLAINS IT TO DONALD 

9508
05:57:15,713 --> 05:57:16,347
TRUMP AND SAYS THAT THE FBI, 

9509
05:57:16,347 --> 05:57:16,947
THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN 

9510
05:57:16,947 --> 05:57:17,548
BEATING UP ON FOR THE LAST 

9511
05:57:17,548 --> 05:57:18,215
THREE YEARS, SO WE ARE GOING TO 

9512
05:57:18,215 --> 05:57:18,883
ENTRUST THEM WITH THE FATE OF 

9513
05:57:18,883 --> 05:57:19,483
YOUR SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 

9514
05:57:19,483 --> 05:57:20,051
HOW IS THAT GOING TO PLAY? 

9515
05:57:20,051 --> 05:57:20,718
THIS PRESIDENT HAS TREATED THE 

9516
05:57:20,718 --> 05:57:21,385
FBI AS THE HOBBY HORSE TO BEAT 

9517
05:57:21,385 --> 05:57:21,986
ON FOR THE LAST TWO, THREE 

9518
05:57:21,986 --> 05:57:22,553
YEARS, TAKING ANY OUNCE OF 

9519
05:57:22,553 --> 05:57:23,220
CREDIBILITY THAT HE COULD TAKE 

9520
05:57:23,220 --> 05:57:23,888
OUT OF THEM WITH EVERY PASSING 

9521
05:57:23,888 --> 05:57:24,088
DAY. 

9522
05:57:24,088 --> 05:57:24,555
ISN'T IT REMARKABLE? 

9523
05:57:24,555 --> 05:57:25,056
ISN'T IT INTERESTING? 

9524
05:57:25,056 --> 05:57:25,689
NOW THE FBI COULD HOLD THE KEY 

9525
05:57:25,689 --> 05:57:26,123
TO HIS NOMINATION. 

9526
05:57:26,123 --> 05:57:26,757
I THINK THAT IS FASCINATING. 

9527
05:57:26,757 --> 05:57:27,458
I WONDER AGAIN, WHEN AS LINDSEY 

9528
05:57:27,458 --> 05:57:28,125
GRAHAM SAID, SOMEBODY EXPLAINS 

9529
05:57:28,125 --> 05:57:28,826
THIS TO DONALD TRUMP, HOW HE IS 

9530
05:57:28,826 --> 05:57:29,527
GOING TO REACT TO THAT REALITY. 

9531
05:57:29,527 --> 05:57:30,227
I SUSPECT WE WILL READ ABOUT IT 

9532
05:57:30,227 --> 05:57:30,561
ON TWITTER. 

9533
05:57:30,561 --> 05:57:31,028
I WANT TO ASK YOU. 

9534
05:57:31,028 --> 05:57:31,562
AS YOU LOOK FORWARD AND 

9535
05:57:31,562 --> 05:57:32,163
OBVIOUSLY MIDTERMS IS WHAT 

9536
05:57:32,163 --> 05:57:32,797
MAKES THIS LARGER MAGNITUDE. 

9537
05:57:32,797 --> 05:57:33,431
WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR DEMOCRATS 

9538
05:57:33,431 --> 05:57:33,998
AND REPUBLICANS ULTIMATELY? 

9539
05:57:33,998 --> 05:57:34,665
>> FOR REPUBLICANS, THE SUPREME 

9540
05:57:34,665 --> 05:57:35,299
COURT NOMINEE WAS SUPPOSED TO 

9541
05:57:35,299 --> 05:57:35,966
BE A KEY SELLING POINT TO THEIR 

9542
05:57:35,966 --> 05:57:36,500
VOTERS, TO REMIND THEM, 

9543
05:57:36,500 --> 05:57:37,001
ESPECIALLY THOSE SOFT 

9544
05:57:37,001 --> 05:57:37,468
REPUBLICAN VOTERS OR 

9545
05:57:37,468 --> 05:57:38,102
INDEPENDENTLY MINDED REPUBLICANS

9546
05:57:38,102 --> 05:57:38,803
WHO TEND TO VOTE REPUBLICAN AND 

9547
05:57:38,803 --> 05:57:39,437
ESPECIALLY WOMEN THAT MAY BE 

9548
05:57:39,437 --> 05:57:40,004
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE 

9549
05:57:40,004 --> 05:57:40,571
SAYING, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE 

9550
05:57:40,571 --> 05:57:41,272
EVERYTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS 

9551
05:57:41,272 --> 05:57:41,939
DOING AND HIS RHETORIC AND WHAT 

9552
05:57:41,939 --> 05:57:42,440
HE IS TALKING ABOUT BUT 

9553
05:57:42,440 --> 05:57:43,074
REMEMBER WHY YOU SUPPORTED HIM 

9554
05:57:43,074 --> 05:57:43,541
IN THE FIRST PLACE? 

9555
05:57:43,541 --> 05:57:44,175
REMEMBER WHAT WE WANTED TO 

9556
05:57:44,175 --> 05:57:44,742
ACCOMPLISH AS REPUBLICANS 

9557
05:57:44,742 --> 05:57:45,209
TOGETHER THE AGENDA? 

9558
05:57:45,209 --> 05:57:45,843
THE SUPREME COURT WAS SUPPOSED 

9559
05:57:45,843 --> 05:57:46,544
TO BE THAT AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY 

9560
05:57:46,544 --> 05:57:47,211
A KEY LEGISLATIVE -- SORRY -- A 

9561
05:57:47,211 --> 05:57:47,812
KEY LEGACY FOR THE PRESIDENT 

9562
05:57:47,812 --> 05:57:48,412
BECAUSE THIS IS A LIFETIME 

9563
05:57:48,412 --> 05:57:48,746
APPOINTMENT. 

9564
05:57:48,746 --> 05:57:49,413
THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR 

9565
05:57:49,413 --> 05:57:50,014
REPUBLICANS AND IT IS CLEAR 

9566
05:57:50,014 --> 05:57:50,748
THAT THEY WILL DO WHAT IT TAKES 

9567
05:57:50,748 --> 05:57:51,248
TO GET THAT THROUGH. 

9568
05:57:51,248 --> 05:57:51,882
FOR DEMOCRATS, WE KNOW THAT 

9569
05:57:51,882 --> 05:57:52,483
THEY'RE HIGHLY ENERGIZED AND 

9570
05:57:52,483 --> 05:57:53,184
MOBILIZED, READY TO COME OUT IN 

9571
05:57:53,184 --> 05:57:53,517
THE ELECTION. 

9572
05:57:53,517 --> 05:57:54,218
WE HAVE SEEN THAT BACKED UP BY 

9573
05:57:54,218 --> 05:57:54,785
THE PRIMARIES AND REPORTED 

9574
05:57:54,785 --> 05:57:55,319
NUMBERS OF THE TURNOUT. 

9575
05:57:55,319 --> 05:57:55,986
THE QUESTION IS, THAT THE -- 

9576
05:57:55,986 --> 05:57:56,620
DOES THE SUPREME COURT BECOME 

9577
05:57:56,620 --> 05:57:57,221
AN ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE FOR 

9578
05:57:57,221 --> 05:57:57,855
DEMOCRATS THE WAY IT HAS BEEN 

9579
05:57:57,855 --> 05:57:58,255
FOR REPUBLICANS? 

9580
05:57:58,255 --> 05:57:58,823
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 

9581
05:57:58,823 --> 05:57:59,423
ALSO WHAT IS REALLY TELLING 

9582
05:57:59,423 --> 05:58:00,091
ABOUT THE REASON THAT DEMOCRATS 

9583
05:58:00,091 --> 05:58:00,724
WANTED AN FBI INVESTIGATION IN 

9584
05:58:00,724 --> 05:58:01,392
THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE THEY 

9585
05:58:01,392 --> 05:58:02,093
KNOW THAT PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN 

9586
05:58:02,093 --> 05:58:02,793
CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IS AT A VERY 

9587
05:58:02,793 --> 05:58:03,094
LOW LEVEL. 

9588
05:58:03,094 --> 05:58:03,761
WE HAVE SEEN COMMITTEES THAT 

9589
05:58:03,761 --> 05:58:04,361
WERE TRADITIONALLY KNOWN FOR 

9590
05:58:04,361 --> 05:58:04,829
THEIR BIPARTISANSHIP. 

9591
05:58:04,829 --> 05:58:05,329
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE 

9592
05:58:05,329 --> 05:58:05,996
COMMITTEE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND NOW 

9593
05:58:05,996 --> 05:58:06,630
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THE 

9594
05:58:06,630 --> 05:58:06,864
SENATE. 

9595
05:58:06,864 --> 05:58:07,465
EVEN THOUGH DIANNE FEINSTEIN 

9596
05:58:07,465 --> 05:58:08,132
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY HAVE A GOOD 

9597
05:58:08,132 --> 05:58:08,766
RELATIONSHIP, THERE IS NOT THE 

9598
05:58:08,766 --> 05:58:09,366
LEVEL OF COMPETENCE IN THE 

9599
05:58:09,366 --> 05:58:10,034
PUBLIC THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE 

9600
05:58:10,034 --> 05:58:10,468
CONGRESS HANDLE IT. 

9601
05:58:10,468 --> 05:58:11,001
THE FBI INVESTIGATION IS 

9602
05:58:11,001 --> 05:58:11,602
SUPPOSED TO BE SEEN AS AN 

9603
05:58:11,602 --> 05:58:12,203
INDEPENDENT ARBITER TO MAKE 

9604
05:58:12,203 --> 05:58:12,803
PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE 

9605
05:58:12,803 --> 05:58:13,504
WITH GOING FORWARD, EVEN THOUGH 

9606
05:58:13,504 --> 05:58:14,138
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY 

9607
05:58:14,138 --> 05:58:14,772
TRADITIONALLY GET INVOLVED IN. 

9608
05:58:14,772 --> 05:58:15,372
>> TALKING WITH DEMOCRATS AND 

9609
05:58:15,372 --> 05:58:15,973
THINKING ABOUT THE RED STATE 

9610
05:58:15,973 --> 05:58:16,640
DEMOCRATS, WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

9611
05:58:16,640 --> 05:58:17,308
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO CHIME IN? 

9612
05:58:17,308 --> 05:58:17,942
>> RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE EVERY 

9613
05:58:17,942 --> 05:58:18,476
COVER TO CONTINUE THEIR 

9614
05:58:18,476 --> 05:58:19,110
OPPOSITION TO BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

9615
05:58:19,110 --> 05:58:19,777
THE PRESSURE FOR THEM WAS ONLY 

9616
05:58:19,777 --> 05:58:20,344
REALLY GOING TO BUILD IF 

9617
05:58:20,344 --> 05:58:21,011
REPUBLICANS WERE MONOLITHIC IN 

9618
05:58:21,011 --> 05:58:21,645
SUPPORTING BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 

9619
05:58:21,645 --> 05:58:22,346
WE ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS ALL 

9620
05:58:22,346 --> 05:58:22,746
A POLITICAL PLOY. 

9621
05:58:22,746 --> 05:58:23,347
THERE IS NO REAL INCENTIVE 

9622
05:58:23,347 --> 05:58:23,948
RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE RED STATE 

9623
05:58:23,948 --> 05:58:24,515
DEMOCRATS TO BACK A BRETT 

9624
05:58:24,515 --> 05:58:25,149
KAVANAUGH BUT TO PICK UP ON 

9625
05:58:25,149 --> 05:58:25,716
CAITLIN'S POINT AND LESLIE 

9626
05:58:25,716 --> 05:58:26,217
MENTIONED IT AS WELL. 

9627
05:58:26,217 --> 05:58:26,884
SUBURBAN WOMEN, WOMEN NOT AVID 

9628
05:58:26,884 --> 05:58:27,518
SUPPORTERS OF ONE PARTY OR THE 

9629
05:58:27,518 --> 05:58:28,152
OTHER ARE GOING TO BE CRUCIAL 

9630
05:58:28,152 --> 05:58:28,719
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

9631
05:58:28,719 --> 05:58:29,320
OVERALL BACK IN 2016 DONALD 

9632
05:58:29,320 --> 05:58:29,954
TRUMP LOST WOMEN OVERALL BUT I 

9633
05:58:29,954 --> 05:58:30,588
THINK THAT HE KEPT CLINTON'S 

9634
05:58:30,588 --> 05:58:31,021
MARGIN TO 7 POINTS. 

9635
05:58:31,021 --> 05:58:31,655
THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT POLL 

9636
05:58:31,655 --> 05:58:32,289
SHOWING REPUBLICANS LOSING THE 

9637
05:58:32,289 --> 05:58:32,923
FEMALE VOTE BY 15, 20 POINTS 

9638
05:58:32,923 --> 05:58:33,591
AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE EVENTS 

9639
05:58:33,591 --> 05:58:34,125
OF THE PAST 48 HOURS. 

9640
05:58:34,125 --> 05:58:34,792
IF THAT GAP IS PROVEN BIGGER, 

9641
05:58:34,792 --> 05:58:35,259
THAT IS POTENTIALLY 

9642
05:58:35,259 --> 05:58:35,926
CATASTROPHIC FOR THE REPUBLICAN 

9643
05:58:35,926 --> 05:58:36,160
PARTY. 

9644
05:58:36,160 --> 05:58:36,827
>> AS YOU ARE BREAKING DOWN HOW 

9645
05:58:36,827 --> 05:58:37,495
REPUBLICAN WOMEN ARE LOOKING AT 

9646
05:58:37,495 --> 05:58:38,062
THIS, THEY WERE A CRUCIAL 

9647
05:58:38,062 --> 05:58:38,729
VOTING BLOCK FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

9648
05:58:38,729 --> 05:58:39,330
. WHITE REPUBLICAN WOMEN IN 

9649
05:58:39,330 --> 05:58:40,030
PARTICULAR BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT 

9650
05:58:40,030 --> 05:58:40,664
THE SECTOR, HAVE YOU DONE ANY 

9651
05:58:40,664 --> 05:58:40,931
POLLING? 

9652
05:58:40,931 --> 05:58:41,565
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY POLLING ON 

9653
05:58:41,565 --> 05:58:42,199
HOW THEIR THOUGHTS WERE GOING 

9654
05:58:42,199 --> 05:58:42,500
INTO THIS? 

9655
05:58:42,500 --> 05:58:43,134
>> YOU HAD A MORNING POLITICAL 

9656
05:58:43,134 --> 05:58:43,801
POLL THAT SAID THAT REPUBLICAN 

9657
05:58:43,801 --> 05:58:44,468
WOMEN WERE DROPPING SUPPORT FOR 

9658
05:58:44,468 --> 05:58:45,102
BRETT KAVANAUGH BY 11 POINTS 

9659
05:58:45,102 --> 05:58:45,736
AND THAT IS BEFORE YOU HEARD 

9660
05:58:45,736 --> 05:58:46,337
THE TESTIMONY AND IF YOU GOT 

9661
05:58:46,337 --> 05:58:47,004
THEM BETWEEN THE TESTIMONES IT 

9662
05:58:47,004 --> 05:58:47,605
WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT 

9663
05:58:47,605 --> 05:58:47,972
STORY OVERALL. 

9664
05:58:47,972 --> 05:58:48,606
THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT DR. 

9665
05:58:48,606 --> 05:58:49,240
FORD -- IT WAS SO PASSIONATE 

9666
05:58:49,240 --> 05:58:49,874
AND SO COMPELLING THAT PEOPLE 

9667
05:58:49,874 --> 05:58:50,474
REALLY BELIEVE HER AND 100% 

9668
05:58:50,474 --> 05:58:51,075
IDENTITY OF IDENTIFYING THE 

9669
05:58:51,075 --> 05:58:51,542
ASSAULTER BEING BRETT 

9670
05:58:51,542 --> 05:58:51,842
KAVANAUGH. 

9671
05:58:51,842 --> 05:58:52,276
THAT IS A PROBLEM. 

9672
05:58:52,276 --> 05:58:52,843
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH NOT TO 

9673
05:58:52,843 --> 05:58:53,477
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE, AND I DO 

9674
05:58:53,477 --> 05:58:54,145
NOT WANT TO DO THE FBI THING, 

9675
05:58:54,145 --> 05:58:54,745
MARK JUDGE IS A RECOVERING 

9676
05:58:54,745 --> 05:58:55,346
ADDICT AND WE CANNOT REALLY 

9677
05:58:55,346 --> 05:58:55,946
RELY ON HIS JUDGMENT ANYWAY. 

9678
05:58:55,946 --> 05:58:56,647
THAT IS ALMOST WHAT THEY WERE 

9679
05:58:56,647 --> 05:58:57,314
TRYING TO DO IS MINIMIZE THAT 

9680
05:58:57,314 --> 05:58:57,815
PERSON AS A WITNESS. 

9681
05:58:57,815 --> 05:58:58,482
IT JUST SEEMED ODD AND THEN HIS 

9682
05:58:58,482 --> 05:58:58,816
TEMPERAMENT. 

9683
05:58:58,816 --> 05:58:59,483
SO IT LEFT A LOT OF UNANSWERED 

9684
05:58:59,483 --> 05:59:00,151
QUESTIONS THAT REPUBLICANS NEED 

9685
05:59:00,151 --> 05:59:00,885
TO ADDRESS IF THEY WANT TO KEEP 

9686
05:59:00,885 --> 05:59:01,285
THE REPUBLICANS. 

9687
05:59:01,285 --> 05:59:01,886
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RED 

9688
05:59:01,886 --> 05:59:02,319
STATE DEMOCRATS. 

9689
05:59:02,319 --> 05:59:02,887
JOE MANSION SAYS THAT HE 

9690
05:59:02,887 --> 05:59:03,554
SUPPORTS JEFF FLAKE'S CALL FOR 

9691
05:59:03,554 --> 05:59:04,054
AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 

9692
05:59:04,054 --> 05:59:04,655
SPIRIT I THINK THAT WE ARE 

9693
05:59:04,655 --> 05:59:05,322
HEARING THE GANG OF FOUR COME 

9694
05:59:05,322 --> 05:59:05,890
OUT AND REVEAL THEMSELVES. 

9695
05:59:05,890 --> 05:59:06,557
WE HAD JEFF FLAKE AND MURKOWSKI 

9696
05:59:06,557 --> 05:59:07,224
AND NOW WE HAVE GOT MANSION AND 

9697
05:59:07,224 --> 05:59:07,892
THE WATCH WILL BE ON FOR HEIDI 

9698
05:59:07,892 --> 05:59:08,559
HEITKAMP OR FOR SUSAN COLLINS. 

9699
05:59:08,559 --> 05:59:09,160
THAT MAKES SENSE AND I TAKE 

9700
05:59:09,160 --> 05:59:09,760
YOUR POINT EARLIER ABOUT RED 

9701
05:59:09,760 --> 05:59:10,161
STATE DEMOCRATS. 

9702
05:59:10,161 --> 05:59:10,761
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THEY 

9703
05:59:10,761 --> 05:59:11,395
STILL FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE. 

9704
05:59:11,395 --> 05:59:12,096
PRETTY GOOD CONTACTS WITH SOME 

9705
05:59:12,096 --> 05:59:12,696
REALLY HIGH-PROFILE RED STATE 

9706
05:59:12,696 --> 05:59:13,297
DEMOCRATS AND THEY HONEST-TO-

9707
05:59:13,297 --> 05:59:13,931
GOODNESS DO NOT FEEL LIKE ANY 

9708
05:59:13,931 --> 05:59:14,565
OF THIS HAS TAKEN THEM OFF THE 

9709
05:59:14,565 --> 05:59:14,832
GRIDDLE. 

9710
05:59:14,832 --> 05:59:15,466
THEY THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 

9711
05:59:15,466 --> 05:59:16,167
IS STILL WILDLY POPULAR IN SOME 

9712
05:59:16,167 --> 05:59:16,800
OF THEIR STATES, PLACES LIKE 

9713
05:59:16,800 --> 05:59:17,401
NORTH DAKOTA, WEST VIRGINIA, 

9714
05:59:17,401 --> 05:59:18,035
MONTANA, EVEN THOUGH WE HEARD 

9715
05:59:18,035 --> 05:59:18,636
TESTER COME OUT AGAINST BRETT 

9716
05:59:18,636 --> 05:59:19,303
KAVANAUGH BUT WE KNOW THAT THE 

9717
05:59:19,303 --> 05:59:19,937
PRESIDENT IS POPULAR THERE AND 

9718
05:59:19,937 --> 05:59:20,638
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS NOT 

9719
05:59:20,638 --> 05:59:21,305
ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT IT IS 

9720
05:59:21,305 --> 05:59:21,772
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. 

9721
05:59:21,772 --> 05:59:22,473
THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 

9722
05:59:22,473 --> 05:59:23,073
COUNTRY DO NOT SEE THIS AS 

9723
05:59:23,073 --> 05:59:23,741
BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT THEY SEE IT 

9724
05:59:23,741 --> 05:59:24,308
AS DONALD TRUMP IF I KNOW 

9725
05:59:24,308 --> 05:59:24,975
ANYTHING ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, 

9726
05:59:24,975 --> 05:59:25,643
I BET THAT NONE OF THE PEOPLE 

9727
05:59:25,643 --> 05:59:26,210
IN WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH 

9728
05:59:26,210 --> 05:59:26,844
DAKOTA, NO OFFENSE, PROBABLY 

9729
05:59:26,844 --> 05:59:27,444
COULD NOT CITE CASELAW FROM 

9730
05:59:27,444 --> 05:59:28,112
BRETT KAVANAUGH OR ANY PARTS OF 

9731
05:59:28,112 --> 05:59:28,779
HIS RESUME BUT THEY KNOW THAT 

9732
05:59:28,779 --> 05:59:29,446
HE IS DONALD TRUMP'S CHOICE AND 

9733
05:59:29,446 --> 05:59:30,047
THAT IS JOE MANSION OR HEIDI 

9734
05:59:30,047 --> 05:59:30,714
HEITKAMP OR JOE DONNELLY GOES 

9735
05:59:30,714 --> 05:59:31,348
AGAINST THEM, THAT MEANS THAT 

9736
05:59:31,348 --> 05:59:31,916
THEY ARE GOING AGAINST THE 

9737
05:59:31,916 --> 05:59:32,216
PRESIDENT. 

9738
05:59:32,216 --> 05:59:32,850
I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE 

9739
05:59:32,850 --> 05:59:33,450
HOW THE RIVALS ARE GOING TO 

9740
05:59:33,450 --> 05:59:33,651
PLAY. 

9741
05:59:33,651 --> 05:59:34,285
WE SAW MIKE BRAUN IN INDIANA 

9742
05:59:34,285 --> 05:59:34,952
COMING OUT STRONGLY TO TRY TO 

9743
05:59:34,952 --> 05:59:35,586
BRACKET JOE DONNELLY ON THAT 

9744
05:59:35,586 --> 05:59:35,819
ISSUE. 

9745
05:59:35,819 --> 05:59:36,487
I IMAGINE WE WILL SEE THE SAME 

9746
05:59:36,487 --> 05:59:37,121
THING EVEN THOUGH MANSION HAS 

9747
05:59:37,121 --> 05:59:37,488
NOT COMMITTED. 

9748
05:59:37,488 --> 05:59:38,088
I DO NOT KNOW IF THE PRESS 

9749
05:59:38,088 --> 05:59:38,756
RELEASE WILL GO OUT AFTER JEFF 

9750
05:59:38,756 --> 05:59:39,123
FLAKE DID THIS. 

9751
05:59:39,123 --> 05:59:39,790
>> ONE SECOND THAT WE HAVE A 

9752
05:59:39,790 --> 05:59:40,424
PRESS RELEASE FROM JOE MANSION 

9753
05:59:40,424 --> 05:59:41,091
AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS BUT 

9754
05:59:41,091 --> 05:59:41,659
FOLLOWING THE STATEMENT OF 

9755
05:59:41,659 --> 05:59:42,293
SENATOR FLAKE, CALLING FOR THE 

9756
05:59:42,293 --> 05:59:42,960
ONE WEEK FBI INVESTIGATION, I'M 

9757
05:59:42,960 --> 05:59:43,627
CODY, I APPLAUD THE DECISION TO 

9758
05:59:43,627 --> 05:59:44,295
RISE ABOVE THE PARTISAN CIRCUS 

9759
05:59:44,295 --> 05:59:44,962
ON DISPLAY DURING THIS ENTIRE 

9760
05:59:44,962 --> 05:59:45,229
PROCESS. 

9761
05:59:45,229 --> 05:59:45,930
IT TOOK COURAGE TO TAKE A STAND 

9762
05:59:45,930 --> 05:59:46,530
AND CALL FOR A ONE WEEK FBI 

9763
05:59:46,530 --> 05:59:47,097
DESICCATION TO GET TO THE 

9764
05:59:47,097 --> 05:59:47,631
BOTTOM OF THE ALLEGATIONS 

9765
05:59:47,631 --> 05:59:48,165
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

9766
05:59:48,165 --> 05:59:48,832
THIS HAS BEEN A PARTISAN AND A 

9767
05:59:48,832 --> 05:59:49,233
DIVISIVE PROCESS. 

9768
05:59:49,233 --> 05:59:49,900
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

9769
05:59:49,900 --> 05:59:50,501
PULLED APART BY THIS ENTIRE 

9770
05:59:50,501 --> 05:59:51,168
SPECTACLE AND WE NEED TO TAKE 

9771
05:59:51,168 --> 05:59:51,769
TIME TO ADDRESS THESE CLAIMS 

9772
05:59:51,769 --> 05:59:52,336
INDEPENDENTLY SO THAT OUR 

9773
05:59:52,336 --> 05:59:53,003
COUNTRY CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 

9774
05:59:53,003 --> 05:59:53,704
THE OUTCOME OF THIS VOTE BUT IT 

9775
05:59:53,704 --> 05:59:54,371
IS WHAT IS RIGHT AND FAIR FOR 

9776
05:59:54,371 --> 05:59:54,972
DR. FORD, JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

9777
05:59:54,972 --> 05:59:55,439
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

9778
05:59:55,439 --> 05:59:55,873
ANYBODY SURPRISED? 

9779
05:59:55,873 --> 05:59:56,106
>> NO. 

9780
05:59:56,106 --> 05:59:56,807
IN TERMS OF JUST GOING BACK TO 

9781
05:59:56,807 --> 05:59:57,408
THE BARE POLITICS OF THIS, 

9782
05:59:57,408 --> 05:59:58,042
ASSUMING THAT NOTHING COMES OUT 

9783
05:59:58,042 --> 05:59:58,742
OF THIS INVESTIGATION, IT DOES 

9784
05:59:58,742 --> 05:59:59,376
GIVE THOSE RED STATE DEMOCRATS 

9785
05:59:59,376 --> 06:00:00,044
SOME COVER TO SAY, LOOK, I DID 

9786
06:00:00,044 --> 06:00:00,578
SUPPORT LOOKING AT THIS 

9787
06:00:00,578 --> 06:00:00,844
FURTHER. 

9788
06:00:00,844 --> 06:00:01,512
I DID NOT COME OUT RIGHT AWAY I 

9789
06:00:01,512 --> 06:00:01,845
SUPPORT HIM. 

9790
06:00:01,845 --> 06:00:02,479
I DID NOT COME OUT RIGHT AWAY 

9791
06:00:02,479 --> 06:00:02,846
AND DENY HIM. 

9792
06:00:02,846 --> 06:00:03,514
I AM DOING MY DUE DILIGENCE AS 

9793
06:00:03,514 --> 06:00:04,148
A MEMBER OF THE SENATE WERE 

9794
06:00:04,148 --> 06:00:04,848
ADVISE AND CONSENT IS OR TO THE 

9795
06:00:04,848 --> 06:00:05,416
DUTY OF THE UPPER CHAMBER. 

9796
06:00:05,416 --> 06:00:06,016
I THINK THIS WORKS WELL FOR 

9797
06:00:06,016 --> 06:00:06,417
THEM RIGHT NOW. 

9798
06:00:06,417 --> 06:00:07,017
AGAIN, BARRING NOTHING COMES 

9799
06:00:07,017 --> 06:00:07,685
UP, IF SOMETHING DOES COME UP, 

9800
06:00:07,685 --> 06:00:08,385
THEY ARE ABLE TO SAY, THE FBI, 

9801
06:00:08,385 --> 06:00:08,986
INDEPENDENT BODY, FOUND THIS 

9802
06:00:08,986 --> 06:00:09,320
INFORMATION. 

9803
06:00:09,320 --> 06:00:10,020
SELECT JUST TO JUMP IN QUICKLY, 

9804
06:00:10,020 --> 06:00:10,554
I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL 

9805
06:00:10,554 --> 06:00:11,155
DISCUSSING THIS ON THE BASIS 

9806
06:00:11,155 --> 06:00:11,822
THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATION THAT 

9807
06:00:11,822 --> 06:00:12,423
I UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE NOT 

9808
06:00:12,423 --> 06:00:12,756
DOING THAT. 

9809
06:00:12,756 --> 06:00:13,257
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DENIES 

9810
06:00:13,257 --> 06:00:13,557
WRONGDOING. 

9811
06:00:13,557 --> 06:00:14,191
WHAT IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE? 

9812
06:00:14,191 --> 06:00:14,892
WHAT IF THEY DO IN FACT CUT -- 

9813
06:00:14,892 --> 06:00:15,392
UNCOVER SOME DAMAGING 

9814
06:00:15,392 --> 06:00:15,726
INFORMATION? 

9815
06:00:15,726 --> 06:00:16,393
WHAT IF MORE ALLEGATIONS COME 

9816
06:00:16,393 --> 06:00:16,961
FORWARD THAT ARE SEEN AS 

9817
06:00:16,961 --> 06:00:17,595
CREDIBLE AND NOT JUST SOME 

9818
06:00:17,595 --> 06:00:18,195
PARTS EMPLOYEE OR SOMETHING 

9819
06:00:18,195 --> 06:00:18,629
FROM THE FRINGES? 

9820
06:00:18,629 --> 06:00:19,296
THEN YOU ARE IN A VERY SERIOUS 

9821
06:00:19,296 --> 06:00:19,964
SITUATION DOES THAT BLOWBACK ON 

9822
06:00:19,964 --> 06:00:20,631
THOSE REPUBLICAN SENATORS THAT 

9823
06:00:20,631 --> 06:00:21,265
IT'S RADICALLY WANTED TO GO 

9824
06:00:21,265 --> 06:00:21,732
AHEAD WITH THE BRETT 

9825
06:00:21,732 --> 06:00:22,233
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION? 

9826
06:00:22,233 --> 06:00:22,933
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO 

9827
06:00:22,933 --> 06:00:23,601
DEFY THESE CALLS TO HOLD BACK? 

9828
06:00:23,601 --> 06:00:24,201
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

9829
06:00:24,201 --> 06:00:24,802
THAT WE WILL NOT KNOW THE 

9830
06:00:24,802 --> 06:00:25,469
ANSWER TO FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT 

9831
06:00:25,469 --> 06:00:25,703
LEAST. 

9832
06:00:25,703 --> 06:00:26,303
>>> THE INTERESTING PART IS 

9833
06:00:26,303 --> 06:00:26,971
THAT MANY REPUBLICANS FEEL THAT 

9834
06:00:26,971 --> 06:00:27,538
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS FALSELY 

9835
06:00:27,538 --> 06:00:28,205
ACCUSED AND THEY POINT TO THAT 

9836
06:00:28,205 --> 06:00:28,906
HE WAS A CIRCUS LEADER OF SOME 

9837
06:00:28,906 --> 06:00:29,540
GANG RAPE KIND OF POSSE AND 

9838
06:00:29,540 --> 06:00:30,207
THAT RIDICULOUS EXTREME, THESE 

9839
06:00:30,207 --> 06:00:30,874
ANONYMOUS LETTERS THAT CAME IN. 

9840
06:00:30,874 --> 06:00:31,475
THEY POINT TO ALL OF THAT. 

9841
06:00:31,475 --> 06:00:32,109
HE IS DEFENDING HIMSELF BECAUSE 

9842
06:00:32,109 --> 06:00:32,776
HE IS ACCUSED OF NOT DOING THIS 

9843
06:00:32,776 --> 06:00:33,444
UNDER THE PRETENSE OF A JUDGE. 

9844
06:00:33,444 --> 06:00:33,644
OKAY. 

9845
06:00:33,644 --> 06:00:34,278
THOSE ARE VERY FAIR ARGUMENTS 

9846
06:00:34,278 --> 06:00:34,812
AND IT IS POLITICIZED. 

9847
06:00:34,812 --> 06:00:35,446
LET'S ASSUME, I SEE A SCENARIO 

9848
06:00:35,446 --> 06:00:35,946
WHERE YOU CAN SEE BRETT 

9849
06:00:35,946 --> 06:00:36,614
KAVANAUGH CONFIRM THAT YOU COME 

9850
06:00:36,614 --> 06:00:37,248
BACK AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT 

9851
06:00:37,248 --> 06:00:37,915
COMES OUT THAT IS ANY DIFFERENT 

9852
06:00:37,915 --> 06:00:38,582
THERE IS A LITTLE OF THE HEAT 

9853
06:00:38,582 --> 06:00:39,250
IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPIRIT AND 

9854
06:00:39,250 --> 06:00:39,950
LOOKED REASONABLE AND THEY CAME 

9855
06:00:39,950 --> 06:00:40,618
TO AGREE THAT HE IS QUALIFIED 

9856
06:00:40,618 --> 06:00:41,285
AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED IN 35 

9857
06:00:41,285 --> 06:00:41,885
YEARS BUT WE CANNOT RESOLVE 

9858
06:00:41,885 --> 06:00:42,119
THAT. 

9859
06:00:42,119 --> 06:00:42,553
THEY MOVE FORWARD. 

9860
06:00:42,553 --> 06:00:43,220
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A GREAT 

9861
06:00:43,220 --> 06:00:43,821
BODY OF LOVE FOR HIM BUT AT 

9862
06:00:43,821 --> 06:00:44,521
LEAST IT IS A SENSIBLE SOLUTION 

9863
06:00:44,521 --> 06:00:45,122
I THINK THAT IS WHAT WOMEN 

9864
06:00:45,122 --> 06:00:45,723
PARTICULARLY SWEET WOMEN ARE 

9865
06:00:45,723 --> 06:00:46,056
LOOKING FOR. 

9866
06:00:46,056 --> 06:00:46,657
SWING VOTERS, REPUBLICAN OR 

9867
06:00:46,657 --> 06:00:46,857
MAN. 

9868
06:00:46,857 --> 06:00:47,291
MALE OR FEMALE. 

9869
06:00:47,291 --> 06:00:47,891
I THINK THAT THESE FOLKS ARE 

9870
06:00:47,891 --> 06:00:48,492
LOOKING FOR A REASON TO SAY 

9871
06:00:48,492 --> 06:00:48,692
YES. 

9872
06:00:48,692 --> 06:00:49,260
MANSION, JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN 

9873
06:00:49,260 --> 06:00:49,927
COLLINS, MURKOWSKI TO A LESSER 

9874
06:00:49,927 --> 06:00:50,160
EXTENT. 

9875
06:00:50,160 --> 06:00:50,828
THEY WANT A REASON TO SAY YES. 

9876
06:00:50,828 --> 06:00:51,495
THEY ARE WAITING TO LOOK FOR A 

9877
06:00:51,495 --> 06:00:52,096
REASON TO SAY YES AND THEY'RE 

9878
06:00:52,096 --> 06:00:52,730
WAITING TO SEE IF MAYBE WITH 

9879
06:00:52,730 --> 06:00:53,397
TIME AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 

9880
06:00:53,397 --> 06:00:53,964
TIME, MAYBE TIME TAKES THE 

9881
06:00:53,964 --> 06:00:54,298
PRESSURE OFF. 

9882
06:00:54,298 --> 06:00:54,965
WHAT IS INTERESTING IF YOU ARE 

9883
06:00:54,965 --> 06:00:55,599
JOE MANSION I THINK IT IS IN 

9884
06:00:55,599 --> 06:00:56,200
YOUR INTEREST TO GET THIS 

9885
06:00:56,200 --> 06:00:56,867

ABOUT HEALTHCARE AND HOW MUCH 

9888
06:00:58,102 --> 06:00:58,702
THE REPUBLICANS SCREWED OVER 

9889
06:00:58,702 --> 06:00:59,370
YOUR ESTATE WITH HEALTHCARE AND 

9890
06:00:59,370 --> 06:01:00,004

THAT, THAT WORK IN YOUR FAVOR 

9892
06:01:00,671 --> 06:01:01,071
FROM THE POLLS. 

9893
06:01:01,071 --> 06:01:01,739
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I DO 

9894
06:01:01,739 --> 06:01:02,406
NOT THINK JOE MANSION WANTED TO 

9895
06:01:02,406 --> 06:01:02,873
HANG OUT ANY LONGER. 

9896
06:01:02,873 --> 06:01:03,507
>> WE HAVE GOT TO HIT A BREAK 

9897
06:01:03,507 --> 06:01:04,041
AND CAFFEINATED BEVERAGE. 

9898
06:01:04,041 --> 06:01:04,708
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE 

9899
06:01:04,708 --> 06:01:05,109
BREAK RIGHT NOW. 

9900
06:01:05,109 --> 06:01:05,743
WE HAVE GOT ERROR CONTINUING 

9901
06:01:05,743 --> 06:01:06,010
COVERAGE. 

9902
06:01:06,010 --> 06:01:06,610
AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN THE 

9903
06:01:06,610 --> 06:01:06,944
U.S. SENATE. 

9904
06:01:06,944 --> 06:01:07,511
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE. 

9905
06:01:07,511 --> 06:01:07,911
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 

9906
06:01:08,846 --> 06:01:09,246
>>> HI, EVERYONE. 

9907
06:01:09,246 --> 06:01:09,680
I AM REENA NINAN. 

9908
06:01:09,680 --> 06:01:10,281
A DRAMATIC AFTERNOON PLAYING 

9909
06:01:10,281 --> 06:01:10,848
OUT ON CAPITOL HILL AS A 

9910
06:01:10,848 --> 06:01:11,482
REPUBLICAN SENATOR CALLS FOR A 

9911
06:01:11,482 --> 06:01:12,116
DELAY IN THE CONFIRMATION OF 

9912
06:01:12,116 --> 06:01:12,683
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 

9913
06:01:12,683 --> 06:01:12,983
KAVANAUGH. 

9914
06:01:12,983 --> 06:01:13,651
JEFF FLAKE HAD A MAJOR REVERSAL.

9915
06:01:13,651 --> 06:01:14,285
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 

9916
06:01:14,285 --> 06:01:14,918
WAS PREPARING TO VOTE AND HE 

9917
06:01:14,918 --> 06:01:15,552
SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO 

9918
06:01:15,552 --> 06:01:16,220
VOTE IN COMMITTEE BUT HE WANTED 

9919
06:01:16,220 --> 06:01:16,887
A WEEKLONG DELAY FOR THE FBI TO 

9920
06:01:16,887 --> 06:01:17,554
LOOK INTO ALLGATIONS OF SEXUAL 

9921
06:01:17,554 --> 06:01:18,188
ASSAULT AGAINST THE SUPREME OR 

9922
06:01:18,188 --> 06:01:18,822
NOMINEE BEFORE A FULL SENATE 

9923
06:01:18,822 --> 06:01:19,056
VOTE. 

9924
06:01:19,056 --> 06:01:19,757
>> I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A 

9925
06:01:19,757 --> 06:01:20,424
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER 

9926
06:01:20,424 --> 06:01:20,624
SIDE. 

9927
06:01:20,624 --> 06:01:21,225
WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ON 

9928
06:01:21,225 --> 06:01:21,859
GOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD 

9929
06:01:21,859 --> 06:01:22,526
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE 

9930
06:01:22,526 --> 06:01:23,160
DILIGENCE HERE, AND I THINK IT 

9931
06:01:23,160 --> 06:01:23,794
WOULD BE PROPER TO DELAY THE 

9932
06:01:23,794 --> 06:01:24,428
FLOOR VOTE FOR UP TO BUT NOT 

9933
06:01:24,428 --> 06:01:25,095
MORE THAN ONE WEEK IN ORDER TO 

9934
06:01:25,095 --> 06:01:25,796
LET THE FBI CONTINUE -- TO DO AN

9935
06:01:25,796 --> 06:01:26,463
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN TIME 

9936
06:01:26,463 --> 06:01:27,031
AND SCOPE, TO THE CURRENT 

9937
06:01:27,031 --> 06:01:27,631
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THERE. 

9938
06:01:27,631 --> 06:01:28,265
>> THIS COMES AFTER A DAY OF 

9939
06:01:28,265 --> 06:01:28,766
EMOTIONAL, HIGH-STAKES 

9940
06:01:28,766 --> 06:01:29,300
TESTIMONY BY BOTH BRETT 

9941
06:01:29,300 --> 06:01:29,933
KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER, DR. 

9942
06:01:29,933 --> 06:01:30,567
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD ON THE 

9943
06:01:30,567 --> 06:01:31,268
HELP IT FORD SAYS SHE IS 100% 

9944
06:01:31,268 --> 06:01:31,902
CERTAIN IT IS KAVANAUGH THAT 

9945
06:01:31,902 --> 06:01:32,603
TRY TO RAPE HER WHILE THEY WERE 

9946
06:01:32,603 --> 06:01:33,003
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

9947
06:01:33,003 --> 06:01:33,570
BRETT KAVANAUGH DENIES THE 

9948
06:01:33,570 --> 06:01:33,904
ALLEGATIONS. 

9949
06:01:33,904 --> 06:01:34,538
PRIOR TO THE DELAY,  IT WAS 

9950
06:01:34,538 --> 06:01:35,172
UNCLEAR IF REPUBLICANS HAD THE 

9951
06:01:35,172 --> 06:01:35,673
VOTES TO CONFIRM BRETT 

9952
06:01:35,673 --> 06:01:35,973
KAVANAUGH.  

9953
06:01:35,973 --> 06:01:36,607
LISA MURKOWSKI SAYS SHE BACKS 

9954
06:01:36,607 --> 06:01:37,241
JEFF FLAKE'S CALL FOR A DELAY 

9955
06:01:37,241 --> 06:01:37,908
AND JOE MANSION, DECIDE, BACKS 

9956
06:01:37,908 --> 06:01:38,342
THE IDEA AS WELL. 

9957
06:01:38,342 --> 06:01:38,942
THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR THE 

9958
06:01:38,942 --> 06:01:39,310
SENATE TO VOTE. 

9959
06:01:39,310 --> 06:01:39,843
IN THE WAKE OF TODAY'S 

9960
06:01:39,843 --> 06:01:40,477
DEVELOPERS, HE SAID HE JUST 

9961
06:01:40,477 --> 06:01:41,145
WANTS THINGS TO WORK OUT WELL 

9962
06:01:41,145 --> 06:01:41,545
FOR THE COUNTRY. 

9963
06:01:41,545 --> 06:01:42,179
HE ALSO HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT 

9964
06:01:42,179 --> 06:01:42,713
YESTERDAY'S GUT WRENCHING 

9965
06:01:42,713 --> 06:01:43,013
TESTIMONY. 

9966
06:01:43,013 --> 06:01:43,647
>> I FEEL LIKE HER TESTIMONY 

9967
06:01:43,647 --> 06:01:44,248
WAS VERY COMPELLING AND SHE 

9968
06:01:44,248 --> 06:01:44,948
LOOKS LIKE A VERY FINE WOMAN TO 

9969
06:01:44,948 --> 06:01:45,115
ME. 

9970
06:01:45,115 --> 06:01:45,582
A VERY FINE WOMAN. 

9971
06:01:45,582 --> 06:01:46,150
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT 

9972
06:01:46,150 --> 06:01:46,650
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, 

9973
06:01:46,650 --> 06:01:47,318
LIKEWISE, WAS REALLY SOMETHING 

9974
06:01:47,318 --> 06:01:47,951
THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. 

9975
06:01:47,951 --> 06:01:48,385
IT WAS INCREDIBLE. 

9976
06:01:48,385 --> 06:01:49,053
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT, I 

9977
06:01:49,053 --> 06:01:49,687
THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 

9978
06:01:49,687 --> 06:01:49,953
COUNTRY. 

9979
06:01:49,953 --> 06:01:50,554
BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY 

9980
06:01:50,554 --> 06:01:50,988
CREDIBLE WITNESS. 

9981
06:01:50,988 --> 06:01:51,588
SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY 

9982
06:01:51,588 --> 06:01:52,256
RESPECTS, AND I THINK THAT -- I 

9983
06:01:52,256 --> 06:01:52,956
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO 

9984
06:01:52,956 --> 06:01:53,624
CONTINUE ONWARD OR IF WE ARE 

9985
06:01:53,624 --> 06:01:54,124
GOING TO GET A VOTE. 

9986
06:01:54,124 --> 06:01:54,625

SENATORS ARE SUPPORTED  -- 

9991
06:01:56,894 --> 06:01:57,461
SUPPORTIVE OF THE DELAY. 

9992

9993
06:01:58,095 --> 06:01:58,662

THAT HE IS ON BOARD WITH JEFF

FORWARD UNTIL THE FBI GETS THE 

10007
06:02:06,570 --> 06:02:06,770
BALL. 

10008
06:02:06,770 --> 06:02:07,438
THERE IS A GROUP OF REPUBLICAN

MANSION IS FACING PRESSURE TO

06:02:22,820 --> 06:02:23,354

NIALL STANEK, LESLIE SANCHEZ 

10063
06:02:38,235 --> 06:02:38,869
AND JOEL AS WELL, JILL PENA. 

10064
06:02:38,869 --> 06:02:39,403
LET ME START WITH YOU. 

10065
06:02:39,403 --> 06:02:40,104
WE WERE TALKING LAST NIGHT. WE 

10066
06:02:40,104 --> 06:02:40,771
WERE ALL DISCUSSING ABOUT 2020. 

10067
06:02:40,771 --> 06:02:41,472
I KNOW THAT THIS IS -- I WANT 

10068
06:02:41,472 --> 06:02:42,005
TO TAKE A BIG STEP BACK. 

10069
06:02:42,005 --> 06:02:42,606
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT 2020. 

10070
06:02:42,606 --> 06:02:43,273
THERE WERE A LOT OF MOMENTS IN 

10071
06:02:43,273 --> 06:02:43,841
THE TESTIMONY YESTERDAY OF 

10072
06:02:43,841 --> 06:02:44,475
POTENTIAL FOLKS, PRODUCING THE 

10073
06:02:44,475 --> 06:02:45,142
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT MIGHT BE 

10074
06:02:45,142 --> 06:02:45,409
RUNNING. 

10075
06:02:45,409 --> 06:02:45,776
>> THERE WERE. 

10076
06:02:45,776 --> 06:02:46,443
BROOKER, CAMILLA HARRIS, INSIDE 

10077
06:02:46,443 --> 06:02:47,077
THE COMMITTEE BUT WE HAVE NOT 

10078
06:02:47,077 --> 06:02:47,611
EVEN -- LET'S THINK ABOUT 

10079
06:02:47,611 --> 06:02:48,178
ELIZABETH WARREN AND ABOUT 

10080
06:02:48,178 --> 06:02:48,812
BERNIE SANDERS, JOE BIDEN WHO, 

10081
06:02:48,812 --> 06:02:49,313
BY THE WAY, CAME UP 

10082
06:02:49,313 --> 06:02:49,913
TANGENTIALLY A COUPLE TIMES 

10083
06:02:49,913 --> 06:02:50,547
TODAY, NOT JUST FOR HIS ROLE 

10084
06:02:50,547 --> 06:02:51,181
BACK WITH ANITA HILL, 25 YEARS 

10085
06:02:51,181 --> 06:02:51,715
AGO, BUT ALSO FOR SOME 

10086
06:02:51,715 --> 06:02:52,349
PRESIDENT THAT HE ESTABLISHED 

10087
06:02:52,349 --> 06:02:52,783
ON THE COMMITTEE. 

10088
06:02:52,783 --> 06:02:53,117
IT IS HERE. 

10089
06:02:53,117 --> 06:02:53,717
BOTH WITH THE INDIVIDUALS BUT 

10090
06:02:53,717 --> 06:02:54,351
ALSO WITH THE FRAMING OF THE 

10091
06:02:54,351 --> 06:02:54,585
ISSUES. 

10092
06:02:54,585 --> 06:02:54,818
RIGHT? 

10093
06:02:54,818 --> 06:02:55,552
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT GENERALLY AN 

10094
06:02:55,552 --> 06:02:56,220
ORGANIZING ISSUE THAT DEMOCRATS 

10095
06:02:56,220 --> 06:02:56,420
USE. 

10096
06:02:56,420 --> 06:02:57,087
DEMOCRATS DO NOT GENERALLY VOTE 

10097
06:02:57,087 --> 06:02:57,588
ON THE SUPREME COURT. 

10098
06:02:57,588 --> 06:02:58,255
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT 

10099
06:02:58,255 --> 06:02:58,922
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

10100
06:02:58,922 --> 06:02:59,590
BUILD A GIGANTIC LEAD, NOT JUST 

10101
06:02:59,590 --> 06:03:00,257
WITH THE SUPREME COURT BUT WITH 

10102
06:03:00,257 --> 06:03:00,724
A LOWER COURTS, ETC. 

10103
06:03:00,724 --> 06:03:01,091
THAT CHANGES. 

10104
06:03:01,091 --> 06:03:01,692
DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO TREAT 

10105
06:03:01,692 --> 06:03:02,326
THIS AS AN ORGANIZING ISSUE. 

10106
06:03:02,326 --> 06:03:02,760
I AM SURE OF IT. 

10107
06:03:02,760 --> 06:03:03,327
NOT JUST BECAUSE IT IS A 

10108
06:03:03,327 --> 06:03:03,994
DEMOCRATIC ISSUE BUT BECAUSEIT 

10109
06:03:03,994 --> 06:03:04,661
IS A WOMAN'S ISSUE AND THE FACT 

10110
06:03:04,661 --> 06:03:05,329
THAT WOMEN ARE AT THE FOREFRONT.

10111
06:03:05,329 --> 06:03:05,996
RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN RUNNING 

10112
06:03:05,996 --> 06:03:06,597
FOR SENATE, HOUSE, GOVERNORS 

10113
06:03:06,597 --> 06:03:07,097
RACES, ALL LEVELS OF 

10114
06:03:07,097 --> 06:03:07,398
GOVERNMENT. 

10115
06:03:07,398 --> 06:03:08,065
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER IN TERMS 

10116
06:03:08,065 --> 06:03:08,332
OF 2020. 

10117
06:03:08,332 --> 06:03:08,966
I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS IS 

10118
06:03:08,966 --> 06:03:09,666
GOING TO BE A BACK BURNER ISSUE 

10119
06:03:09,666 --> 06:03:10,033
FOR DEMOCRATS. 

10120
06:03:10,033 --> 06:03:10,734
>> WE HAVE SEEN TO YOUR POINT 

10121
06:03:10,734 --> 06:03:11,301
ABOUT WOMEN AND BEING AN 

10122
06:03:11,301 --> 06:03:11,969
OUTSIZED CONSTITUENCY AND CORE 

10123
06:03:11,969 --> 06:03:12,536
CONSTITUENCY FOR EVERYBODY 

10124
06:03:12,536 --> 06:03:13,170
RUNNING IN 2015 INCLUDING THE 

10125
06:03:13,170 --> 06:03:13,737
CANDIDATES THEMSELVES AT A 

10126
06:03:13,737 --> 06:03:14,371
RECORD PACE IN TERMS OF WOMEN 

10127
06:03:14,371 --> 06:03:14,671
CANDIDATES. 

10128
06:03:14,671 --> 06:03:15,339
YOU HAVE SEEN FROM REPUBLICANS 

10129
06:03:15,339 --> 06:03:16,006
AND THE PRESIDENT, STARTING TO 

10130
06:03:16,006 --> 06:03:16,673
REALIZE THAT THIS IS A REALLY 

10131
06:03:16,673 --> 06:03:17,307
POTENTIALLY BIG ISSUE IN TERMS 

10132
06:03:17,307 --> 06:03:17,941
OF WOMEN AND THE SENSITIVITIES 

10133
06:03:17,941 --> 06:03:18,275
AROUND THAT. 

10134
06:03:18,275 --> 06:03:18,842
LISTENIG TO THE PRESIDENTS 

10135
06:03:18,842 --> 06:03:19,443
STATEMENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

10136
06:03:19,443 --> 06:03:20,110
TODAY, I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY 

10137
06:03:20,110 --> 06:03:20,744
REMARKABLE, CALLING CHRISTINE 

10138
06:03:20,744 --> 06:03:21,412
FORD'S TESTIMONY COMPELLING AND 

10139
06:03:21,412 --> 06:03:21,979
CALLING HER A FINE WOMAN. 

10140
06:03:21,979 --> 06:03:22,513
ESSENTIALLY GIVING HER A 

10141
06:03:22,513 --> 06:03:23,080
CREDENCE WHICH WAS REALLY 

10142
06:03:23,080 --> 06:03:23,414
INTERESTING. 

10143
06:03:23,414 --> 06:03:24,014
THE REPUBLIAN SENATORS KNOW 

10144
06:03:24,014 --> 06:03:24,648
THAT THE OPTICS OF YESTERDAY 

10145
06:03:24,648 --> 06:03:25,349
WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN WORSE HAD 

10146
06:03:25,349 --> 06:03:26,016
THEY BEEN THE ONES QUESTIONING 

10147
06:03:26,016 --> 06:03:26,216
FORD. 

10148
06:03:26,216 --> 06:03:26,884
CERTAINLY THAT IS PLAYING INTO 

10149
06:03:26,884 --> 06:03:27,217
ALL OF THIS. 

10150
06:03:27,217 --> 06:03:27,818
>> THERE IS ALSO THIS ONE 

10151
06:03:27,818 --> 06:03:28,485
MOMENT WHEN YOU SEE HER, RACHEL 

10152
06:03:28,485 --> 06:03:29,019
MITCHELL, QUESTIONING AND 

10153
06:03:29,019 --> 06:03:29,620
SILENT REPUBLICAN SAID -- 

10154
06:03:29,620 --> 06:03:30,254
SENATORS AND SOMEBODY TWEETED 

10155
06:03:30,254 --> 06:03:30,854
OUT, I BELIEVE IT WAS MOM'S 

10156
06:03:30,854 --> 06:03:31,488
DEMAND JUSTICE, TWEETING OUT, 

10157
06:03:31,488 --> 06:03:32,156
WHY NOT VOTE MORE WOMEN AND IF 

10158
06:03:32,156 --> 06:03:32,756
IT TAKES A WOMAN TO DO THE 

10159
06:03:32,756 --> 06:03:33,090
QUESTIONING? 

10160
06:03:33,090 --> 06:03:33,524
I AGREE COMPLETELY. 

10161
06:03:33,524 --> 06:03:34,224
LET'S  THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 

10162
06:03:34,224 --> 06:03:34,892
HAS GONE TO THIS IS A CONCEPT 

10163
06:03:34,892 --> 06:03:35,392
TO THE ONE HOUR PRESS 

10164
06:03:35,392 --> 06:03:36,093
CONFERENCE WHERE HE SAID I HAVE 

10165
06:03:36,093 --> 06:03:36,693
BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED AND THE 

10166
06:03:36,693 --> 06:03:37,394
TWO DOZEN WOMEN ALL OF THEM AND 

10167
06:03:37,394 --> 06:03:38,028
CORRECTED RECEPTION AND SO HE 

10168
06:03:38,028 --> 06:03:38,662
WAS LOOKING AT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

10169
06:03:38,662 --> 06:03:39,296
THROUGH THAT CAMERA LENS AND 

10170
06:03:39,296 --> 06:03:39,930
THEN VERY QUICK TO DEFEND HIM 

10171
06:03:39,930 --> 06:03:40,564
AT ALL COST AND MANY OF THE 

10172
06:03:40,564 --> 06:03:41,198
REPUBLICAN STUDY LINE, LINDSEY 

10173
06:03:41,198 --> 06:03:41,799
GRAHAM LEADING THAT MARCH. 

10174
06:03:41,799 --> 06:03:42,466
WE HEARD HER AND WE HEARD HIM. 

10175
06:03:42,466 --> 06:03:42,866
WE BELIEVE HER. 

10176
06:03:42,866 --> 06:03:43,267
WE BELIEVE HIM. 

10177
06:03:43,267 --> 06:03:43,867
CONFUSED OR FALSE IDENTITY, 

10178
06:03:43,867 --> 06:03:44,568
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IS THE 

10179
06:03:44,568 --> 06:03:45,169
WAY THAT THEY RECONCILE IT. 

10180
06:03:45,169 --> 06:03:45,836
LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD 

10181
06:03:45,836 --> 06:03:46,470
BUT I THINK THAT IS WHERE THE 

10182
06:03:46,470 --> 06:03:47,137
CRY AND THE HEAT WAS GETTING SO 

10183
06:03:47,137 --> 06:03:47,404
INTENSE. 

10184
06:03:47,404 --> 06:03:47,971
REALLY CALM HER VOICES, A 

10185
06:03:47,971 --> 06:03:48,572
POLITICAL WIN AT WHAT COST? 

10186
06:03:48,572 --> 06:03:49,139
WE BELIEVE THAT REPUBLICANS 

10187
06:03:49,139 --> 06:03:49,706
SHOULD HAVE THE SEED AND 

10188
06:03:49,706 --> 06:03:50,307
REPUBLICANS DESERVE THE SEAT 

10189
06:03:50,307 --> 06:03:50,908
BECAUSE OF THE WIN IN 2016. 

10190
06:03:50,908 --> 06:03:51,475
IS HE THE BEST CANDIDATE? 

10191
06:03:51,475 --> 06:03:51,942
I THINK HE COULD BE. 

10192
06:03:51,942 --> 06:03:52,576
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A REASON 

10193
06:03:52,576 --> 06:03:53,243
TO VOTE YES, THE SENATORS ARE, 

10194
06:03:53,243 --> 06:03:53,911
AND GIVING IT THIS PAUSE COULD 

10195
06:03:53,911 --> 06:03:54,278
GIVE THEM THAT. 

10196
06:03:54,278 --> 06:03:54,945
>>> WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE 

10197
06:03:54,945 --> 06:03:55,612
ELEVATION, BRINKSMANSHIP IN THE 

10198
06:03:55,612 --> 06:03:56,013
BATTLE IN COURT. 

10199
06:03:56,013 --> 06:03:56,613
YOU HAVE GOT TO THINK ABOUT 

10200
06:03:56,613 --> 06:03:57,181
THIS, NOT JUST ABOUT BRETT 

10201
06:03:57,181 --> 06:03:57,481
KAVANAUGH. 

10202
06:03:57,481 --> 06:03:58,115
THIS IS ABOUT MERRICK GARLAND. 

10203
06:03:58,115 --> 06:03:58,782
IT IS ABOUT HARRY REID, NUCLEAR 

10204
06:03:58,782 --> 06:03:59,483
OPTION ON THE COURT A COUPLE OF 

10205
06:03:59,483 --> 06:04:00,083
YEARS AGO, AND IT IS ABOUT 

10206
06:04:00,083 --> 06:04:00,317
BOARD. 

10207
06:04:00,317 --> 06:04:00,517
OKAY? 

10208
06:04:00,517 --> 06:04:01,185
THIS IS A BATTLE FOR THE COURT 

10209
06:04:01,185 --> 06:04:01,785
THAT HAS BEEN ELEVATING FOR 

10210
06:04:01,785 --> 06:04:02,453
PROBABLY THE PAST 20+ YEARS AND 

10211
06:04:02,453 --> 06:04:03,120
REALLY IT IS REACHING CRESCENDO 

10212
06:04:03,120 --> 06:04:03,353
POINT. 

10213
06:04:03,353 --> 06:04:03,987
I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS 

10214
06:04:03,987 --> 06:04:04,688
ANY SIGNS THAT THIS IS GOING TO 

10215
06:04:04,688 --> 06:04:04,922
BACK OFF. 

10216
06:04:04,922 --> 06:04:05,522
úI AM INTERESTED IN Y 

10217
06:04:05,522 --> 06:04:06,223
REPORTING IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT 

10218
06:04:06,223 --> 06:04:06,523
WOULD SAY. 

10219
06:04:06,523 --> 06:04:07,124
I DO NOT GET THE SENSE THAT 

10220
06:04:07,124 --> 06:04:07,791
THIS IS -- ANYBODY'S GOING TO 

10221
06:04:07,791 --> 06:04:08,425
COME IN AND BE LIKE, YOU KNOW 

10222
06:04:08,425 --> 06:04:08,659
WHAT? 

10223
06:04:08,659 --> 06:04:09,359
LET'S JUST LOOK PAST ALL OF THE 

10224
06:04:09,359 --> 06:04:09,927
ORIGINAL SINS OF THE PAST. 

10225
06:04:09,927 --> 06:04:10,294
LET'S LOOK FAR. 

10226
06:04:10,294 --> 06:04:10,894
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT NOBODY IS 

10227
06:04:10,894 --> 06:04:11,595
GOING TO UNILATERALLY DISARM OR 

10228
06:04:11,595 --> 06:04:12,095
VOLUNTEER TO DO THAT. 

10229
06:04:12,095 --> 06:04:12,796
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE 

10230
06:04:12,796 --> 06:04:13,330
THIS OUT OF THE SENATE. 

10231
06:04:13,330 --> 06:04:13,897
TAKE IT OUT OF THE SUPREME 

10232
06:04:13,897 --> 06:04:14,498
COURT NOMINATION IN AND OF 

10233
06:04:14,498 --> 06:04:14,731
ITSELF. 

10234
06:04:14,731 --> 06:04:15,332
THIS HAS BECOME A CULTURAL 

10235
06:04:15,332 --> 06:04:15,933
RECKONING IN THIS COUNTRY. 

10236
06:04:15,933 --> 06:04:16,567
YOU MENTIONED YESTERDAY DURING 

10237
06:04:16,567 --> 06:04:17,167
THE LIVE COVERAGE THAT THE 

10238
06:04:17,167 --> 06:04:17,835
WORLD IS KIND OF WATCHING ALL 

10239
06:04:17,835 --> 06:04:18,368
OF THIS BECAUSE THIS IS 

10240
06:04:18,368 --> 06:04:19,002
SPEAKING TO SO MANY DIFFERENT 

10241
06:04:19,002 --> 06:04:19,636
ISSUES OF IDENTITY, OF WOMEN, 

10242
06:04:19,636 --> 06:04:20,304
OF ISSUES THAT OUR COUNTRY IS 

10243
06:04:20,304 --> 06:04:20,871
FACING ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. 

10244
06:04:20,871 --> 06:04:21,505
SO THIS HAS TAKEN A SIGNIFICANCE

10245
06:04:21,505 --> 06:04:22,206
AND IT HAS BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO 

10246
06:04:22,206 --> 06:04:22,806
PEOPLE BEYOND JUST THE NEXT 

10247
06:04:22,806 --> 06:04:23,240
SUPREME COURT PICK? 

10248
06:04:23,240 --> 06:04:23,874
RICK WE TALK ABOUT WOMEN AND 

10249
06:04:23,874 --> 06:04:24,475
WHAT A KEY ISSUE AND MOMENT 

10250
06:04:24,475 --> 06:04:24,741
THIS WAS. 

10251
06:04:24,741 --> 06:04:25,442
WE ALSO LOOK BACK AT ANITA HILL 

10252
06:04:25,442 --> 06:04:25,843
IN THE 26 YEARS. 

10253
06:04:25,843 --> 06:04:26,443
I HAD RITA BRAVER ON, SUNNY 

10254
06:04:26,443 --> 06:04:26,977
MORNING, CORRESPOND TO, A 

10255
06:04:26,977 --> 06:04:27,611
CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT FOR 

10256
06:04:27,611 --> 06:04:28,111
CBS NEWS AT THE TIME. 

10257
06:04:28,111 --> 06:04:28,712
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW SHE 

10258
06:04:28,712 --> 06:04:29,313
ACTUALLY FEELS IN THOSE 26 

10259
06:04:29,313 --> 06:04:29,947
YEARS WHAT LITTLE HAS CHANGED 

10260
06:04:29,947 --> 06:04:30,614
WHEN IT COMES TO PROGRESS FOR 

10261
06:04:30,614 --> 06:04:31,181
WOMEN AND SEXUAL ASSAULT 

10262
06:04:31,181 --> 06:04:31,815
>> IT WAS CLEAR YESTERDAY THAT 

10263
06:04:31,815 --> 06:04:32,382
THE COMMITTEE, THAT SAME 

10264
06:04:32,382 --> 06:04:33,050
COMMITTEE, HAD STILL NOT REALLY 

10265
06:04:33,050 --> 06:04:33,717
FIGURED OUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS. 

10266
06:04:33,717 --> 06:04:34,151
IT WAS REMARKABLE. 

10267
06:04:34,151 --> 06:04:34,852
ORRIN HATCH, RETIRING THIS SOON 

10268
06:04:34,852 --> 06:04:35,486
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY WERE THERE 

10269
06:04:35,486 --> 06:04:35,819
IN THAT ROOM. 

10270
06:04:35,819 --> 06:04:36,453
THERE ARE STILL NO REPUBLICAN 

10271
06:04:36,453 --> 06:04:37,120
WOMEN ON THAT SENATE JUDICIARY 

10272
06:04:37,120 --> 06:04:37,421
COMMITTEE. 

10273
06:04:37,421 --> 06:04:38,021
THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF 

10274
06:04:38,021 --> 06:04:38,655
THEM STILL IN CONGRESS RIGHT 

10275
06:04:38,655 --> 06:04:38,856
NOW. 

10276
06:04:38,856 --> 06:04:39,490
SO IT IS REMARKABLE. WE TALK 

10277
06:04:39,490 --> 06:04:40,057
ABOUT HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED 

10278
06:04:40,057 --> 06:04:40,757
SINCE THEN AND WE ALSO NEED TO 

10279
06:04:40,757 --> 06:04:41,291
ALK ABOUT HOW LITTLE HA 

10280
06:04:41,291 --> 06:04:41,892
CHANGED AND HOW MUCH REMAINS 

10281
06:04:41,892 --> 06:04:42,159
THE SAME. 

10282
06:04:42,159 --> 06:04:42,759
>> I WANT TO PLAY -- I'M 

10283
06:04:42,759 --> 06:04:43,393
CURIOUS IF SENATOR FLAKE WOULD 

10284
06:04:43,393 --> 06:04:43,994
SAY THAT THIS WAS A PIVOTAL 

10285
06:04:43,994 --> 06:04:44,628
MOMENT THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED 

10286
06:04:44,628 --> 06:04:45,295
HIS DECISION ON HOW HE VOTES. 

10287
06:04:45,295 --> 06:04:45,896
HE WAS CONFRONTED BY SOME 

10288
06:04:45,896 --> 06:04:46,630
PROTESTERS IN AN ELEVATOR AS HE 

10289
06:04:46,630 --> 06:04:46,964
WAS EXITING. 

10290
06:04:46,964 --> 06:04:47,564
>> I TOLD THE STORY OF MY 

10291
06:04:47,564 --> 06:04:48,232
SEXUAL ASSAULT I TOLD THEM -- 

10292
06:04:48,232 --> 06:04:48,665
TELLING THE TRUTH. 

10293
06:04:48,665 --> 06:04:49,333
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ALLOWING 

10294
06:04:49,333 --> 06:04:50,033
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY VIOLATED A 

10295
06:04:50,033 --> 06:04:50,634
WOMAN TO SIT IN THE SUPREME 

10296
06:04:50,634 --> 06:04:50,868
COURT. 

10297
06:04:50,868 --> 06:04:51,401
THIS IS NOT TOLERABLE. 

10298
06:04:51,401 --> 06:04:52,002
YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN YOUR 

10299
06:04:52,002 --> 06:04:52,236
FAMILY. 

10300
06:04:52,236 --> 06:04:52,636
THINK ABOUT THEM. 

10301
06:04:52,636 --> 06:04:53,103
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN. 

10302
06:04:53,103 --> 06:04:53,737
I CANNOT IMAGINE FOR THE NEXT 

10303
06:04:53,737 --> 06:04:54,471
50 YEARS THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE 

10304
06:04:54,471 --> 06:04:55,072
SOMEONE IN THE SUPREME COURT 

10305
06:04:55,072 --> 06:04:55,639
THAT HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF 

10306
06:04:55,639 --> 06:04:56,139
VIOLATING A YOUNG GIRL. 

10307
06:04:56,139 --> 06:04:56,707
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SIR? 

10308
06:04:56,707 --> 06:04:57,241
>> NOBODY BELIEVES ME. 

10309
06:04:57,241 --> 06:04:57,875
I DID NOT TELL ANYONE AND YOU 

10310
06:04:57,875 --> 06:04:58,509
ARE TELLING ALL WOMEN THAT IF 

10311
06:04:58,509 --> 06:04:59,209
YOU TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENS, YOU 

10312
06:04:59,209 --> 06:04:59,776
ARE GOING TO IGNORE THEM. 

10313
06:04:59,776 --> 06:05:00,444
THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ALL 

10314
06:05:00,444 --> 06:05:00,878
WOMEN IN AMERICA. 

10315
06:05:00,878 --> 06:05:01,578
>> I WANT TO TURN TO JOE PAIN. 

10316
06:05:01,578 --> 06:05:02,246
YOU SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME 

10317
06:05:02,246 --> 06:05:02,646
ON CAPITOL HILL. 

10318
06:05:02,646 --> 06:05:03,213
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW 

10319
06:05:03,213 --> 06:05:03,814
OPTICS MATTER PICKETS I WAS 

10320
06:05:03,814 --> 06:05:04,481
SENATOR FLAKE, WHAT DO YOU DO? 

10321
06:05:04,481 --> 06:05:05,082
>> HE HANDLED THAT THE BEST 

10322
06:05:05,082 --> 06:05:05,449
THAT HE COULD. 

10323
06:05:05,449 --> 06:05:06,116
WE HAD CHATTER THAT MAYBE STAFF 

10324
06:05:06,116 --> 06:05:06,717
COULD HAVE HELPED HIM OUT. 

10325
06:05:06,717 --> 06:05:07,384
CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THAT WAS, 

10326
06:05:07,384 --> 06:05:08,018
IN THE MEMBERS ONLY AREA AND 

10327
06:05:08,018 --> 06:05:08,485
CLEARLY IT WAS NOT. 

10328
06:05:08,485 --> 06:05:09,119
I THINK THAT IF CITIZENS ARE 

10329
06:05:09,119 --> 06:05:09,820
WATCHING WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT AN 

10330
06:05:09,820 --> 06:05:10,487
HOUR OR TWO HOURS LATER, THAT 

10331
06:05:10,487 --> 06:05:10,754
MATTERS. 

10332
06:05:10,754 --> 06:05:11,455
THAT TYPE OF ADVOCACY MATTERS. 

10333
06:05:11,455 --> 06:05:12,055
YOU CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THE 

10334
06:05:12,055 --> 06:05:12,756
IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF US AT SOME 

10335
06:05:12,756 --> 06:05:13,423
POINT IN OUR CAREER SPENT TIME 

10336
06:05:13,423 --> 06:05:13,957
IN CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE. 

10337
06:05:13,957 --> 06:05:14,625
YOU GET THE LETTERS AND EMAILS. 

10338
06:05:14,625 --> 06:05:15,192
SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK IT 

10339
06:05:15,192 --> 06:05:15,559
DOESN'T MATTER. 

10340
06:05:15,559 --> 06:05:16,159
PEOPLE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION. 

10341
06:05:16,159 --> 06:05:16,760
IF YOU GET 10,000 LETTERS, 

10342
06:05:16,760 --> 06:05:17,394
10,000 EMAILS IN A DAY OR 70 

10343
06:05:17,394 --> 06:05:18,061
CONFRONTS YOU IN A HALLWAY THAT 

10344
06:05:18,061 --> 06:05:18,762
PASSIONATELY OR SOMEBODY SHARES 

10345
06:05:18,762 --> 06:05:19,429
A MESSAGE THAT SINCE HOME WITH 

10346
06:05:19,429 --> 06:05:19,897
YOU, THAT MATTERS. 

10347
06:05:19,897 --> 06:05:20,464
THAT SITS WITH YOU IN A 

10348
06:05:20,464 --> 06:05:21,098
COMMITTEE HEARING AND WHEN YOU 

10349
06:05:21,098 --> 06:05:21,665
ARE VOTING ON THE FLOOR. 

10350
06:05:21,665 --> 06:05:22,332
I THINK THAT CITIZEN ACTION AND 

10351
06:05:22,332 --> 06:05:22,966
PROGRESS RIGHT THERE THAT WE 

10352
06:05:22,966 --> 06:05:23,333
CANNOT IGNORE. 

10353
06:05:23,333 --> 06:05:23,967
>> THE UNDERCURRENT THERE AND 

10354
06:05:23,967 --> 06:05:24,668
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT IS THIS 

10355
06:05:24,668 --> 06:05:25,235
AWAKENING ON THE ISSUE OF 

10356
06:05:25,235 --> 06:05:25,903
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE NERVE IT 

10357
06:05:25,903 --> 06:05:26,403
HITS IN THE TONE AND 

10358
06:05:26,403 --> 06:05:26,937
CONVERSATION AND HITTING 

10359
06:05:26,937 --> 06:05:27,504
FREQUENCY WITH WOMEN -- 

10360
06:05:27,504 --> 06:05:28,171
>> IF IT IS AN AWAKENING, SO 

10361
06:05:28,171 --> 06:05:28,872
MANY WOMEN HAVE ASKED ME, IF HE 

10362
06:05:28,872 --> 06:05:29,506
MAKES IT ONTO THE COURT, WHAT 

10363
06:05:29,506 --> 06:05:30,107
DOES IT SAY TO US THAT YOU 

10364
06:05:30,107 --> 06:05:30,641
STILL DO NOT BELIEVE IS? 

10365
06:05:30,641 --> 06:05:31,208
THERE IS NO SOLID PROOF. 

10366
06:05:31,208 --> 06:05:31,775
THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE. 

10367
06:05:31,775 --> 06:05:32,442
WE DO NOT HAVE SOLID PROOF OVER 

10368
06:05:32,442 --> 06:05:33,043
WHOSE TESTIMONY TO BELIEVE. 

10369
06:05:33,043 --> 06:05:33,410
>> THANK YOU. 

10370
06:05:33,410 --> 06:05:33,877
THAT IS THE PUSHBACK. 

10371
06:05:33,877 --> 06:05:34,611
WE SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMING THAT 

10372
06:05:34,611 --> 06:05:35,212
HE IS GUILTY OF A LOT OF 

10373
06:05:35,212 --> 06:05:35,879
REPUBLICAN WOMEN ARE LIKE, WAIT 

10374
06:05:35,879 --> 06:05:36,480
A MINUTE, THERE ARE TWO SIDES 

10375
06:05:36,480 --> 06:05:37,147
AND HE DESERVES A FAIR HEARING 

10376
06:05:37,147 --> 06:05:37,814
BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT IT WAS 

10377
06:05:37,814 --> 06:05:38,215
NECESSARILY FAIR. 

10378
06:05:38,215 --> 06:05:38,849
I THINK THEY WERE BOTH VERY 

10379
06:05:38,849 --> 06:05:39,149
COMPELLING. 

10380
06:05:39,149 --> 06:05:39,616
THAT IS THE QUESTION. 

10381
06:05:39,616 --> 06:05:40,350
IT IS NOT LINING UP IN TERMS OF 

10382
06:05:40,350 --> 06:05:41,018
HOW PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO IT. 

10383
06:05:41,018 --> 06:05:41,552
SOME PEOPLE ARE HAVING A 

10384
06:05:41,552 --> 06:05:42,219
VISCERAL REACTION BECAUSE THEY 

10385
06:05:42,219 --> 06:05:42,786
HAVE EXPERIENCED SOMETHING 

10386
06:05:42,786 --> 06:05:43,487
THEMSELVES AND IT'S PERSONAL TO 

10387
06:05:43,487 --> 06:05:43,720
THEM. 

10388
06:05:43,720 --> 06:05:44,388
IT SPEAKS TO THAT FREQUENCY DR. 

10389
06:05:44,388 --> 06:05:44,988
FORD IS TALKING TO BUT OTHER 

10390
06:05:44,988 --> 06:05:45,622
WOMEN MAY SAY, BOYS WILL BE 

10391
06:05:45,622 --> 06:05:46,290
BOYS OR MEN AND THEY DISMISS IT 

10392
06:05:46,290 --> 06:05:46,857
AND THIS IS NOT HAVE THAT 

10393
06:05:46,857 --> 06:05:47,124
SEVERITY. 

10394
06:05:47,124 --> 06:05:47,791
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE 

10395
06:05:47,791 --> 06:05:48,025
TRUTH. 

10396
06:05:48,025 --> 06:05:48,692
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND 

10397
06:05:48,692 --> 06:05:49,326
LEADERS HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE 

10398
06:05:49,326 --> 06:05:50,027
MOMENT OF INTENSITY TO MAKE THE 

10399
06:05:50,027 --> 06:05:50,394
RIGHT DECISION. 

10400
06:05:50,394 --> 06:05:51,028
THAT IS WHY RUSHING THIS IS A 

10401
06:05:51,028 --> 06:05:51,562
DETRIMENTAL THING FOR THE 

10402
06:05:51,562 --> 06:05:52,195
REPUBLICAN PARTY TO PUSH IT 

10403
06:05:52,195 --> 06:05:52,462
THROUGH. 

10404
06:05:52,462 --> 06:05:53,030
IT WILL SHOW THAT POINT. 

10405
06:05:53,030 --> 06:05:53,463
WE DID NOT LISTEN. 

10406
06:05:53,463 --> 06:05:53,864
WE DID NOT CARE. 

10407
06:05:53,864 --> 06:05:54,231
SHE IS WRONG. 

10408
06:05:54,231 --> 06:05:54,698
SHE IS MISINFORMED. 

10409
06:05:54,698 --> 06:05:55,332
THAT IS COUNTING OF ANY WOMAN 

10410
06:05:55,332 --> 06:05:55,966
OR ANY VOTER HAS MAJOR, MAJOR 

10411
06:05:55,966 --> 06:05:56,199
IMPACT. 

10412
06:05:56,199 --> 06:05:56,700
>> I AGREE WITH THAT 

10413
06:05:56,700 --> 06:05:57,000
COMPLETELY. 

10414
06:05:57,000 --> 06:05:57,634
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE 

10415
06:05:57,634 --> 06:05:58,268
GET CAUGHT UP IN STRONGMAN 

10416
06:05:58,268 --> 06:05:58,569
ARGUMENTS. 

10417
06:05:58,569 --> 06:05:59,169
IT SEEMS TO ME TALKING TO 

10418
06:05:59,169 --> 06:05:59,703
FEMALE FRIENDS, GENERALLY 

10419
06:05:59,703 --> 06:06:00,304
SPEAKING, WHAT PEOPLE ARE 

10420
06:06:00,304 --> 06:06:00,938
CALLING FOR HIS ALLEGATIONS TO 

10421
06:06:00,938 --> 06:06:01,572
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY 

10422
06:06:01,572 --> 06:06:01,805
ARISE. 

10423
06:06:01,805 --> 06:06:02,439
IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO GO 

10424
06:06:02,439 --> 06:06:02,973
AHEAD AND CONFIRM SOMEONE 

10425
06:06:02,973 --> 06:06:03,640
WITHOUT EVEN PAUSING FOR A WEEK 

10426
06:06:03,640 --> 06:06:04,308
WHICH IS WHAT SENATOR FLAKE IS 

10427
06:06:04,308 --> 06:06:04,975
CALLING FOR, THAT SEEMS TO BE 

10428
06:06:04,975 --> 06:06:05,676
EMBLEMATIC OF A LACK OF TAKING 

10429
06:06:05,676 --> 06:06:06,243
THE ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. 

10430
06:06:06,243 --> 06:06:06,944
IT IS ONLY A MINORITY OF PEOPLE 

10431
06:06:06,944 --> 06:06:07,578
THAT ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE 

10432
06:06:07,578 --> 06:06:08,245
SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING, IT IS 

10433
06:06:08,245 --> 06:06:08,879
AUTOMATICALLY TRUE, BUT LET'S 

10434
06:06:08,879 --> 06:06:09,479
HAVE A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION 

10435
06:06:09,479 --> 06:06:10,113
INTO IF CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS 

10436
06:06:10,113 --> 06:06:10,380
ARE TRUE. 

10437
06:06:10,380 --> 06:06:11,014
I WANT TO WEIGH IN THAT AMY 

10438
06:06:11,014 --> 06:06:11,548
KLOBUCHAR SPOKE AFTER THE 

10439
06:06:11,548 --> 06:06:12,249
DRAMATIC TURN BY SENATOR FLAKE. 

10440
06:06:12,249 --> 06:06:12,916
>> IT IS SIMPLY DECEMBER FLAKE 

10441
06:06:12,916 --> 06:06:13,584
WORKING WITH ALL OF US TO SAY 

10442
06:06:13,584 --> 06:06:14,251
FOR THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND 

10443
06:06:14,251 --> 06:06:14,851
THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE 

10444
06:06:14,851 --> 06:06:15,552
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE 

10445
06:06:15,552 --> 06:06:16,219
THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP ON, AND I 

10446
06:06:16,219 --> 06:06:16,687
REALLY APPRECIATE HIS 

10447
06:06:16,687 --> 06:06:17,354
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT AND THAT 

10448
06:06:17,354 --> 06:06:17,888
IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. 

10449
06:06:17,888 --> 06:06:18,589
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT -- AND BY 

10450
06:06:18,589 --> 06:06:19,222
THE WAY, IF SENATOR McCONNELL 

10451
06:06:19,222 --> 06:06:19,923
WANTS TO GO FORWARD IN LIGHT OF 

10452
06:06:19,923 --> 06:06:20,591
THAT AND WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL 

10453
06:06:20,591 --> 06:06:21,258
SENATORS THAT HAVE NOT SAID HOW 

10454
06:06:21,258 --> 06:06:21,959
THEY'RE VOTING ON THIS NOMINEE, 

10455
06:06:21,959 --> 06:06:22,626
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT 

10456
06:06:22,626 --> 06:06:23,260
WHAT JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW. 

10457
06:06:23,260 --> 06:06:23,827
CX SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR 

10458
06:06:23,827 --> 06:06:24,394
WEIGHING IN AND THERE WAS A 

10459
06:06:24,394 --> 06:06:25,062
DRAMATIC MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE 

10460
06:06:25,062 --> 06:06:25,562
TALKING ABOUT DRINKING. 

10461
06:06:25,562 --> 06:06:25,829
>> YES. 

10462
06:06:25,829 --> 06:06:26,530
AND AMY KLOBUCHAR, THE WOMAN -- 

10463
06:06:26,530 --> 06:06:27,197
SENATOR WAS THAT HER FATHER WAS 

10464
06:06:27,197 --> 06:06:27,864
AN ALCOHOLIC AND SHE WAS ASKING 

10465
06:06:27,864 --> 06:06:28,532
HIM ABOUT DRINKING ANY TURN THE 

10466
06:06:28,532 --> 06:06:29,166
TABLE BACK AT HER AND SAID I 

10467
06:06:29,166 --> 06:06:29,466
DON'T KNOW. 

10468
06:06:29,466 --> 06:06:30,133
HAVE YOU EVER HAD TOO MUCH TO 

10469
06:06:30,133 --> 06:06:30,367
DRINK? 

10470
06:06:30,367 --> 06:06:30,968
HAVE YOU EVER BLACKED OUT? 

10471
06:06:30,968 --> 06:06:31,602
IT WAS COMPLETELY INSENSITIVE 

10472
06:06:31,602 --> 06:06:32,302
AND WHAT WAS REMARKABLE IS THAT 

10473
06:06:32,302 --> 06:06:32,903
WE NOTICE THE WOMAN BEHIND 

10474
06:06:32,903 --> 06:06:33,537
BRETT, KIND OF SLIPPED HIM A 

10475
06:06:33,537 --> 06:06:34,171
PAPER AND THEN THEY TOOK A 

10476
06:06:34,171 --> 06:06:34,871
BREAK AND THEN HE CAME BACK AND 

10477
06:06:34,871 --> 06:06:35,539
HE ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED TO HER 

10478
06:06:35,539 --> 06:06:36,239
BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT, AS 

10479
06:06:36,239 --> 06:06:36,840
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SENATE 

10480
06:06:36,840 --> 06:06:37,374
RELATIONSHIPS AND HOW THE 

10481
06:06:37,374 --> 06:06:37,975
SENATE AS OF YESTERDAY JUST 

10482
06:06:37,975 --> 06:06:38,675
SEEMED TO STOOP TO A LEVEL THAT 

10483
06:06:38,675 --> 06:06:39,242
EVERYBODY WAS UNCOMFORTABLE 

10484
06:06:39,242 --> 06:06:39,943
WITH AT THE TIME AFTER WATCHING 

10485
06:06:39,943 --> 06:06:40,577
THAT HEARING. TODAY I THINK IT 

10486
06:06:40,577 --> 06:06:41,144
SHOWS THAT SOME OF THESE 

10487
06:06:41,144 --> 06:06:41,812
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SENATE DO 

10488
06:06:41,812 --> 06:06:42,045
MATTER. 

10489
06:06:42,045 --> 06:06:42,746
AND ALSO JEFF FLAKE, THE REASON 

10490
06:06:42,746 --> 06:06:43,413
THAT WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON FLAKE 

10491
06:06:43,413 --> 06:06:44,081
IS TALKING ABOUT FLAKE IS THAT 

10492
06:06:44,081 --> 06:06:44,448
HE IS RETIRING. 

10493
06:06:44,448 --> 06:06:45,048
HE IS A TOP CRITIC OF THE 

10494
06:06:45,048 --> 06:06:45,716
PRESIDENT AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT 

10495
06:06:45,716 --> 06:06:46,350
HE HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT OF A 

10496
06:06:46,350 --> 06:06:46,883
PARIAH IN HIS OWN PARTY. 

10497
06:06:46,883 --> 06:06:47,484
HE WAS NOT GOING TO RUN FOR 

10498
06:06:47,484 --> 06:06:48,151
REELECTION BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR 

10499
06:06:48,151 --> 06:06:48,719
THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO 

10500
06:06:48,719 --> 06:06:49,386
SURVIVE A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN 

10501
06:06:49,386 --> 06:06:50,020
HIS OWN STATE SO HE IS FULLY 

10502
06:06:50,020 --> 06:06:50,687
AWARE OF THE POLITICS HERE AND 

10503
06:06:50,687 --> 06:06:51,388
HE HAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

10504
06:06:51,388 --> 06:06:51,688
PRESIDENT. 

10505
06:06:51,688 --> 06:06:52,389
INSTEAD, IT IS A COMBATIVE ONE. 

10506
06:06:52,389 --> 06:06:53,023
YOU HEARD CHRIS TALK ABOUT HIS 

10507
06:06:53,023 --> 06:06:53,690
RELATIONSHIP WITH JEFF FLAKE. 

10508
06:06:53,690 --> 06:06:54,324
HE IS VERY WELL-LIKED AMONG 

10509
06:06:54,324 --> 06:06:54,992
REPUBLICANS EVEN THOUGH HE IS A 

10510
06:06:54,992 --> 06:06:55,692
DEMOCRAT SO WE ARE STARTING TO 

10511
06:06:55,692 --> 06:06:56,360
SEE THE COMMITTEE TRYING TO GET 

10512
06:06:56,360 --> 06:06:56,960
TO SOME KIND OF SOLUTION. 

10513
06:06:56,960 --> 06:06:57,628
WE WILL SEE HOW LONG THAT LASTS 

10514
06:06:57,628 --> 06:06:58,295
BUT CERTAINLY A DIFFERENCE FROM 

10515
06:06:58,295 --> 06:06:58,962
YESTERDAY AS FAR AS RIGHT NOW AT

10516
06:06:58,962 --> 06:06:59,630
>> TWO OTHER THINGS JUMP OUT. 

10517
06:06:59,630 --> 06:07:00,364
IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT JEFF LIKE 

10518
06:07:00,364 --> 06:07:01,031
AND NOT THINK ABOUT JOHN McCAIN 

10519
06:07:01,031 --> 06:07:01,698
AND CARING THAT LEGACY AND I 

10520
06:07:01,698 --> 06:07:02,332
WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS 

10521
06:07:02,332 --> 06:07:03,000
WITH HIM AS HE WAS REACHING FOR 

10522
06:07:03,000 --> 06:07:03,734
THAT MOMENT AND REALLY STANDING 

10523
06:07:03,734 --> 06:07:04,234
FOR THE INSTITUTION AND 

10524
06:07:04,234 --> 06:07:04,868
STANDING FOR INDEPENDENCE IN 

10525
06:07:04,868 --> 06:07:05,535
TERMS OF DECIDING THINGS LIKE 

10526
06:07:05,535 --> 06:07:06,169
JUDICIAL NOMINEES AND THINGS 

10527
06:07:06,169 --> 06:07:06,470
LIKE THAT. 

10528
06:07:06,470 --> 06:07:07,104
WE KNOW THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO 

10529
06:07:07,104 --> 06:07:07,838
JOHN McCAIN SO I HAVE TO WONDER 

10530
06:07:07,838 --> 06:07:08,505
HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS IN JEFF 

10531
06:07:08,505 --> 06:07:08,839
FLAKE'S MINE. 

10532
06:07:08,839 --> 06:07:09,206
ANOTHER THING. 

10533
06:07:09,206 --> 06:07:09,873
I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE GANG OF 

10534
06:07:09,873 --> 06:07:10,474
FOUR THAT WE FEEL LIKE HAS 

10535
06:07:10,474 --> 06:07:10,741
EMERGED. 

10536
06:07:10,741 --> 06:07:11,341
I COME FROM A TIME IN THE 

10537
06:07:11,341 --> 06:07:11,975
SENATE WHEN THAT USED TO BE 

10538
06:07:11,975 --> 06:07:12,643
VERY COMMON TO HAVE A GANG OF 

10539
06:07:12,643 --> 06:07:13,143
EIGHT, A GANG OF 13. 

10540
06:07:13,143 --> 06:07:13,710
WHEN I STARTED WORKING THE 

10541
06:07:13,710 --> 06:07:14,344
SENATE IN 2005, IT WAS COMMON 

10542
06:07:14,344 --> 06:07:15,045
TO HAVE THESE BIPARTISAN GROUPS 

10543
06:07:15,045 --> 06:07:15,679
GET TOGETHER TO INFLUENCE AND 

10544
06:07:15,679 --> 06:07:16,079
SWAY LEGISLATION. 

10545
06:07:16,079 --> 06:07:16,713
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A 

10546
06:07:16,713 --> 06:07:17,047
BYGONE TIME. 

10547
06:07:17,047 --> 06:07:17,714
BUT ABSOLUTELY IT FEELS ALMOST 

10548
06:07:17,714 --> 06:07:18,382
LIKE THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK A 

10549
06:07:18,382 --> 06:07:18,682
LITTLE BIT. 

10550
06:07:18,682 --> 06:07:19,349
PEOPLE TRYING TO RECAPTURE SOME 

10551
06:07:19,349 --> 06:07:19,983
OF THAT MOMENT FROM THE PAST. 

10552
06:07:19,983 --> 06:07:20,517
>> I AM ALSO CURIOUS. 

10553
06:07:20,517 --> 06:07:21,184
WE KNOW MARK JUDGE WROTE A BOOK 

10554
06:07:21,184 --> 06:07:21,785
AND A CLOSE FRIEND TO JUDGE 

10555
06:07:21,785 --> 06:07:22,252
KAVANAUGH IF THE FBI 

10556
06:07:22,252 --> 06:07:22,819
INVESTIGATION GOES FORWARD 

10557
06:07:22,819 --> 06:07:23,487
WHICH WE ARE NOT CLEAR IF IT 

10558
06:07:23,487 --> 06:07:24,087
WILL OR NOT IF IT HAS THE 

10559
06:07:24,087 --> 06:07:24,354
SUPPORT. 

10560
06:07:24,354 --> 06:07:24,988
IF HE WILL APPEAR AND ANSWER 

10561
06:07:24,988 --> 06:07:25,656
QUESTIONS AND WHAT THE SCOPE OF 

10562
06:07:25,656 --> 06:07:26,023
THIS MIGHT BE. 

10563
06:07:26,023 --> 06:07:26,356
>> GO AHEAD. 

10564
06:07:26,356 --> 06:07:26,990
>> IF HE WOULD ANSWER THEM 

10565
06:07:26,990 --> 06:07:27,658
UNDER OATH OR UNDER PENALTY OF 

10566
06:07:27,658 --> 06:07:28,158
PERJURY SOMETHING THAT 

10567
06:07:28,158 --> 06:07:29,092
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN HAMMERING ú 

10568
06:07:29,092 --> 06:07:29,693
IT IS SOMETHING THAT JUDGE 

10569
06:07:29,693 --> 06:07:30,293
KAVANAUGH WAS VERY RESISTANT 

10570
06:07:30,293 --> 06:07:30,460
TO. 

10571
06:07:30,460 --> 06:07:31,028
I THOUGHT SOMEWHAT EVASIVE 

10572
06:07:31,028 --> 06:07:31,628
ABOUT DURING THE TESTIMONY. 

10573
06:07:31,628 --> 06:07:32,262
THIS IS THE WHOLE DANGER THAT 

10574
06:07:32,262 --> 06:07:32,896
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. 

10575
06:07:32,896 --> 06:07:33,563
TIME IS NOT A FRIEND TO BRETT 

10576
06:07:33,563 --> 06:07:34,164
KAVANAUGH IN THIS RESPECT. 

10577
06:07:34,164 --> 06:07:34,865
THE LONGER THAT THIS PROCESS IS 

10578
06:07:34,865 --> 06:07:35,399
ELONGATED, THEN THE MORE 

10579
06:07:35,399 --> 06:07:35,932
OPPORTUNITY THERE IS FOR 

10580
06:07:35,932 --> 06:07:36,600
NEGATIVE INFORMATION FOR HIM TO 

10581
06:07:36,600 --> 06:07:37,300
EMERGE FROM ACCUSERS TO PERHAPS 

10582
06:07:37,300 --> 06:07:37,634
COME FORWARD. 

10583
06:07:37,634 --> 06:07:38,135
I DO NOT SEE HOW BRETT 

10584
06:07:38,135 --> 06:07:38,769
KAVANAUGH GAINS FROM THIS DELAY 

10585
06:07:38,769 --> 06:07:39,336
UNLESS IT ENDS UP WITH A 

10586
06:07:39,336 --> 06:07:39,903
COMPLETELY CLEAN BILL OF 

10587
06:07:39,903 --> 06:07:40,137
HEALTH. 

10588
06:07:40,137 --> 06:07:40,804
BACK WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE 

10589
06:07:40,804 --> 06:07:41,371
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU. 

10590
06:07:41,371 --> 06:07:41,838
HAS BEEN A MARATHON. 

10591
06:07:41,838 --> 06:07:42,272
GRATEFUL TO YOU. 

10592
06:07:42,272 --> 06:07:42,906
SO GRATEFUL YOU GUYS WILL BE 

10593
06:07:42,906 --> 06:07:43,240
HERE WITH US. 

10594
06:07:43,240 --> 06:07:43,874
AS I MENTIONED, THE PRESIDENT 

10595
06:07:43,874 --> 06:07:44,441
SAID THAT HE DID FIND DR. 

10596
06:07:44,441 --> 06:07:45,075
FORDE'S TESTIMONY CREDIBLE, BUT 

10597
06:07:45,075 --> 06:07:45,709
HE ALSO SAID THAT HE HAS NOT 

10598
06:07:45,709 --> 06:07:46,343
CONSIDER REPLACING HIS SUPREME 

10599
06:07:46,343 --> 06:07:46,710
COURT NOMINEE. 

10600
06:07:46,710 --> 06:07:47,344
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE, IT 

10601
06:07:47,344 --> 06:07:47,978
WAS UNCLEAR HOW MUCH HE KNEW 

10602
06:07:47,978 --> 06:07:48,578
ABOUT THE SUPPORT FOR SENATOR 

10603
06:07:48,578 --> 06:07:49,012
FLAKE'S POSITION. 

10604
06:07:49,012 --> 06:07:49,479
CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 

10605
06:07:49,479 --> 06:07:50,047
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG 

10606
06:07:50,047 --> 06:07:50,514
JOINS US RIGHT NOW. 

10607
06:07:50,514 --> 06:07:51,181
I AM CURIOUS WHAT A MORNING IT 

10608
06:07:51,181 --> 06:07:51,848
HAS BEEN FOR YOU AND WHAT HAVE 

10609
06:07:51,848 --> 06:07:52,215
YOU BEEN HERE? 

10610
06:07:52,215 --> 06:07:52,716
HAS THE MESSAGE BURIED 

10611
06:07:52,716 --> 06:07:53,350
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING OR HAS 

10612
06:07:53,350 --> 06:07:53,984
IT BEEN CONSISTENT?, AND IT'S 

10613
06:07:53,984 --> 06:07:54,584
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT 

10614
06:07:54,584 --> 06:07:55,152
EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT 

10615
06:07:55,152 --> 06:07:55,752
ACKNOWLEDGED HE WAS AWARE OF 

10616
06:07:55,752 --> 06:07:56,420
SOME SORT OF DEVELOPMENT THAT 

10617
06:07:56,420 --> 06:07:57,054
INVOLVED JEFF FLAKE, I REALLY 

10618
06:07:57,054 --> 06:07:57,754
DO NOT THINK THAT HE KNOWS YET 

10619
06:07:57,754 --> 06:07:58,422
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW 

10620
06:07:58,422 --> 06:07:59,022
THIS COULD PLAY OUT AND THE 

10621
06:07:59,022 --> 06:07:59,756
DECISION THAT HE HAS TO MAKE IN 

10622
06:07:59,756 --> 06:08:00,190
THE UPCOMING DAYS. 

10623
06:08:00,190 --> 06:08:00,924
HE CONTINUED TO DEFER TO G.O.P. 

10624
06:08:00,924 --> 06:08:01,625
SENATORS, SAYING THAT HE TRUSTS 

10625
06:08:01,625 --> 06:08:02,259
THEM PICKING THINGS THEY ARE 

10626
06:08:02,259 --> 06:08:02,859
GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 

10627
06:08:02,859 --> 06:08:03,560
TH FACT IS THAT HE IS THE ONE 

10628
06:08:03,560 --> 06:08:04,261
WHO WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER 

10629
06:08:04,261 --> 06:08:04,961
TO ORDER THIS INVESTIGATION  SO 

10630
06:08:04,961 --> 06:08:05,629
EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SAYS 

10631
06:08:05,629 --> 06:08:06,296
THAT HE WILL RELY ON SENATOR 

10632
06:08:06,296 --> 06:08:06,930
GRASSLEY AND MITCH McCONNELL, 

10633
06:08:06,930 --> 06:08:07,564
THAT IS A CONVERSATION THAT 

10634
06:08:07,564 --> 06:08:08,198
THEY WILL ALL, I EXPECT, HAVE 

10635
06:08:08,198 --> 06:08:08,832
VERY SOON AND THEY WILL BE 

10636
06:08:08,832 --> 06:08:09,533
COMING TO HIM TO SAY, PRESIDENT 

10637
06:08:09,533 --> 06:08:10,167
TRUMP, LISTEN, I DO NOT THINK 

10638
06:08:10,167 --> 06:08:10,834
THAT WE HAVE THE VOTES ON THE 

10639
06:08:10,834 --> 06:08:11,501
FULL SENATE FLOOR NOW THAT JEFF 

10640
06:08:11,501 --> 06:08:12,035
FLAKE HAS COME OUT AND I 

10641
06:08:12,035 --> 06:08:12,636
IMAGINE THAT SENATOR COLLINS 

10642
06:08:12,636 --> 06:08:13,270
AND SENATOR McCLOSKEY ARE WITH 

10643
06:08:13,270 --> 06:08:13,737
HIM TO DEMAND THIS 

10644
06:08:13,737 --> 06:08:14,404
INVESTIGATION BEFORE THEY MOVE 

10645
06:08:14,404 --> 06:08:15,005
FORWARD WITH THE FULL VOTE. 

10646
06:08:15,005 --> 06:08:15,605
EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE RIGHT IN 

10647
06:08:15,605 --> 06:08:16,173
THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 

10648
06:08:16,173 --> 06:08:16,840
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND THAT 

10649
06:08:16,840 --> 06:08:17,507
IT MADE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE, I 

10650
06:08:17,507 --> 06:08:18,175
AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT HE HAS 

10651
06:08:18,175 --> 06:08:18,842
BEEN BRIEFED ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT 

10652
06:08:18,842 --> 06:08:19,476
HAS TRANSPIRED AND THAT JEFF 

10653
06:08:19,476 --> 06:08:20,043
FLAKE AND OTHERS COULD BE 

10654
06:08:20,043 --> 06:08:20,711
CALLING FOR THIS INVESTIGATION. 

10655
06:08:20,711 --> 06:08:21,411
IT IS HIS DECISION, EVEN THOUGH 

10656
06:08:21,411 --> 06:08:22,079
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT IT IS 

10657
06:08:22,079 --> 06:08:22,546
UP TO THE SENATORS. 

10658
06:08:22,546 --> 06:08:23,246
HE IS THE ONE THAT IS GOING TO 

10659
06:08:23,246 --> 06:08:23,747
HAVE TO CALL FOR THAT 

10660
06:08:23,747 --> 06:08:24,314
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. 

10661
06:08:24,314 --> 06:08:24,848
BEFORE THIS DEVELOPMENT, 

10662
06:08:24,848 --> 06:08:25,415
THOUGH, THE WHITE HOUSE WAS 

10663
06:08:25,415 --> 06:08:26,049
CERTAINLY VERY OPTIMISTIC AND 

10664
06:08:26,049 --> 06:08:26,750
THROUGHOUT THE DAY THEY THOUGHT 

10665
06:08:26,750 --> 06:08:27,451
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO MAKE IT 

10666
06:08:27,451 --> 06:08:27,884
OUT OF COMMITTEE. 

10667
06:08:27,884 --> 06:08:28,418
THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT 

10668
06:08:28,418 --> 06:08:28,985
ULTIMATELY BRETT KAVANAUGH 

10669
06:08:28,985 --> 06:08:29,586
WOULD BE CONFIRMED BUT THIS 

10670
06:08:29,586 --> 06:08:30,220
CHANGES THE GAME A LITTLE BIT 

10671
06:08:30,220 --> 06:08:30,854
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRATS 

10672
06:08:30,854 --> 06:08:31,555
HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR ALL ALONG. 

10673
06:08:31,555 --> 06:08:32,222
THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE 

10674
06:08:32,222 --> 06:08:32,823
FACTS AS ALL OF THE SENATOR 

10675
06:08:32,823 --> 06:08:33,423
MADE THE FINAL VOTE ON THE 

10676
06:08:33,423 --> 06:08:34,057
SENATE FLOOR ABOUT THE SUPREME 

10677
06:08:34,057 --> 06:08:34,424
COURT NOMINEE. 

10678
06:08:34,424 --> 06:08:35,058
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL TRANSPIRE 

10679
06:08:35,058 --> 06:08:35,726
FROM THE FBI INVESTIGATION IF 

10680
06:08:35,726 --> 06:08:36,193
THERE WILL BE ONE. 

10681
06:08:36,193 --> 06:08:36,893
I IMAGINE THAT IF IT IS MADE 

10682
06:08:36,893 --> 06:08:37,527
CLEAR BY JEFF FLAKE AND OTHER 

10683
06:08:37,527 --> 06:08:38,195
REPUBLICANS, THAT THEY WILL NOT 

10684
06:08:38,195 --> 06:08:38,662
VOTE YES WITHOUT AN 

10685
06:08:38,662 --> 06:08:39,296
INVESTIGATION BUT THE PRESIDENT 

10686
06:08:39,296 --> 06:08:39,963
DOES NOT HAVE MUCH CHOICE BUT 

10687
06:08:39,963 --> 06:08:40,497
TO ORDER ONE, I THINK. 

10688
06:08:40,497 --> 06:08:41,064
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE WHITE 

10689
06:08:41,064 --> 06:08:41,698
HOUSE IS SICK, NOTHING SO FAR 

10690
06:08:41,698 --> 06:08:42,365
ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT 

10691
06:08:42,365 --> 06:08:42,999
BUT BEFORE THIS, THE MOOD WAS 

10692
06:08:42,999 --> 06:08:43,233
UPBEAT. 

10693
06:08:43,233 --> 06:08:43,800
ABOUT THAT 1:30 PM VOTE. 

10694
06:08:43,800 --> 06:08:44,434
I IMAGINE THAT ONCE SOMEBODY 

10695
06:08:44,434 --> 06:08:45,068
EXPLAINS TO THE PRESIDENT THE 

10696
06:08:45,068 --> 06:08:45,702
SITUATION, WE CAN EXPECT MORE 

10697
06:08:45,702 --> 06:08:46,369
FROM HIM AND AS WE HEAR FROM 

10698
06:08:46,369 --> 06:08:46,937
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, HE 

10699
06:08:46,937 --> 06:08:47,571
APPARENTLY THINKS THAT HE IS 

10700
06:08:47,571 --> 06:08:48,004
THE ONE TO DO IT. 

10701
06:08:48,004 --> 06:08:48,638
>> THAT WAS A FUNNY MOMENT AND 

10702
06:08:48,638 --> 06:08:49,172
IT WAS A GOOD POINT OF 

10703
06:08:49,172 --> 06:08:49,806
DISTINCTION THAT YOU MAY THAT 

10704
06:08:49,806 --> 06:08:50,373
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT NOT BE 

10705
06:08:50,373 --> 06:08:51,007
FULLY BRIEFED ON THIS SO WE 

10706
06:08:51,007 --> 06:08:51,708
SHOULD GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF 

10707
06:08:51,708 --> 06:08:52,442
ROOM AS TO SEE IF HE WEIGHS IN 

10708
06:08:52,442 --> 06:08:52,743
THAT LATER. 

10709
06:08:52,743 --> 06:08:53,243
I WANT TO THANK YOU. 

10710
06:08:53,243 --> 06:08:53,777
SPAMMING AFTER A BREAK, 

10711
06:08:53,777 --> 06:08:54,411
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JOE MANSION

10712
06:08:54,411 --> 06:08:55,078
IS ONE OF THE SWING VOTES THAT 

10713
06:08:55,078 --> 06:08:55,746
COULD DECIDE IF BRETT KAVANAUGH 

10714
06:08:55,746 --> 06:08:56,379
GETS ON THE SUPREME COURT AND 

10715
06:08:56,379 --> 06:08:57,013
ALSO FACING A TOUGH REELECTION 

10716
06:08:57,013 --> 06:08:57,547
PLATE IN WEST VIRGINIA. 

10717
06:08:57,547 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
