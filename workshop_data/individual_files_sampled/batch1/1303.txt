Special Counsel Robert Muller wants to talk to the president as part of his negotiation he allegedly provided some of the questions to Donald Trump's lawyers that he wants to ask now leaked to the New York Times it asks what the president knew about his campaign team's communications with Russians why he fired FBI director James Comey and what he knew about hacked Democratic emails but it also points to a new area of investigation it asks quote what knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign including by Paul Manafort to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign the key word there outreach as in did the campaign actively ask for Russia's assistance another question raises new questions it asks after the resignations what efforts were made to reach out to mr. Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon basically when former national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned did you offer him a pardon to stay quiet potentially that could be a crime of obstructing justice Flynn lied to the FBI about communications he had with Russia pled guilty and is cooperating with the investigation Trump took to Twitter to defend himself writing it would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened witch-hunt but that's not how this actually works if investigators are looking into a crime and someone tries to interfere with that investigation that in and of itself is a crime and a potentially impeachable offense regardless of what they find in the original investigation he also went on Twitter to complain and say in part that it was disgraceful that the questions were leaked to the media no questions on collusion he wrote a couple of problems with that the New York Times says the leak came from Trump's side and asked for no collusion most of the questions are actually about collusion we've already seen plenty of evidence of collusion this is not the first piece but obviously if mr. Manafort was in fact talking to the Russians about the campaign that would put it at the very top of the Trump campaign and that would be very close to mr. Trump himself this is a high-stakes question for the president talked to Muller and lie that's a crime or sit down it refused to answer questions that could have serious political repercussions but either way the clock is ticking they'll soon have to decide what to do patty Colleen al Jazeera Washington
