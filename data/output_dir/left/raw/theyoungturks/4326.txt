1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:05,870
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,690
DOWN GOES THE MOOCH.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,690
ALL RIGHT.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,749
AS USUAL, IN THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WE

5
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:18,680
DIDN'T GET HIM, THEY GOT
THEMSELVES.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,590
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A FIRING SQUAD
THIS CIRCULAR BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,970
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE -
ACTUALLY, IF YOU WENT ON

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,910
VACATION FOR JUST LIKE FOUR DAYS
YOU ARE GOING TO COME BACK

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,280
TO, WHAT IN THE WORLD JUST
HAPPENED?

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,200
EVERY SINGLE DAY, DAMAGE REPORT.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,280
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT
BEEN KEEPING TRACK, LET ME GET

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,720
YOU UP-TO-DATE REAL QUICK.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,149
10 DAYS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP

14
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,989
BRINGS IN ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI,
AN OLD FRIEND WHO BY

15
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,330
THE WAY, DID NOT SUPPORT HIM
EARLIER IN THE PRIMARIES, INTO

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,970
THE WHITE HOUSE AS THE WHITE
HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,590
SEAN SPICER IS VERY MAD ABOUT
THAT.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,590
HE QUITS AS PRESS

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,590
SECRETARY.

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,540
HE WAS ACTUALLY ALSO
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR SO

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,720
THAT IS TWO COMMUNICATIONS
DIRECTOR DOWN.

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,920
SCARAMUCCI AND REINCE PRIEBUS,
THE CHIEF OF STAFF, IS

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,790
CALLED A PARANOIAC
AND EVERY CURSE WORD IN A

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:25,630
INTERVIEW WITH RYAN LIZZA, HE
CHARGES REINCE PRIEBUS WITH

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,880
COCK BLOCKING HIM AND HE SAYS,
HE THREATENS TO FIRE EVERYONE IN

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,909
THE COMMUNICATIONS TEAM AND
THE FIRST REPORTS ARE THAT

27
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,520
TRUMP LOVES IT BECAUSE
SCARAMUCCI IS BEING TOUGH AND

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,340
LO AND BEHOLD, BOOM.

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,350
APPARENTLY, IT IS TRUE
BECAUSE REINCE PRIEBUS IS FIRED,

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,150
AND ITíS SCARAMUCCI.

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,000
AND THEN
THEY BRING IN A NEW CHIEF

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,210
OF STAFF, JOHN KELLY.

33
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,000
HE WAS THE
HEAD OF HOMELAND SECURITY,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,130
FORMER GENERAL, THEY BRING HIM
IN AND HE IS GOING TO

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,220
BRING LAW AND ORDER FOR THEM.

36
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,870
SCARAMUCCI IS STILL THERE.

37
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,690
UNTIL TODAY, NOW HE IS OUT.

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,170
THIS IS WRESTLING.

39
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,818
THEYíRE ON THE SAME SIDE

40
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:12,340
THROWING EACH OTHER OUT
OF THE RING.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,340
IT IS

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,310
UNBELIEVABLE, UNPRECEDENTED.

43
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,110
JUST THE DAY BEFORE.

44
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,020
SCARAMUCCI SENT OUT THIS TWEET:
HAD A GREAT CALL WITH GOP

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,020
CHAIRWOMAN.

46
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,620
GOP DOING FANTASTIC WORK TO
SUPPORT POTUS.

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,930
LOOKING FORWARD TO BUILDING
AN EVEN STRONGER RELATIONSHIP.

48
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,860
WRONG, YOU HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP.

49
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,580
YOUíRE FIRED.

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,180
WE'LL GET TO THE COMICAL
EXCUSES IN A MOMENT.

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,180
THIS

52
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,760
MORNING, TRUMP TWEETED, HIGHEST
STOCK MARKET EVER.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,520
I KNOW, HE BUILT IT OVERNIGHT.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,800
IT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PREVIOUS

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,459
EIGHT YEARS LEADING UP TO IT.

56
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,970
BEST ECONOMIC NUMBERS IN YEARS,

57
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,260
UNEMPLOYMENT WITHIN 17 YEARS,
WHICH IS RAISING.

58
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,260
WHATEVER.

59
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,420
SUPREME COURT, NO
WHITE HOUSE CHAOS AND THEN THIS

60
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,420
AFTERNOON, WHITE HOUSE CHAOS.

61
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,940
SCARAMUCCI FELT IT

62
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,720
WAS BEST TO GIVE CHIEF OF STAFF
JOHN KELLY A CLEAN SLATE AND THE

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,879
ABILITY TO BUILD HIS OWN TEAM.

64
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,879
WE WISH HIM ALL THE BEST.

65
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,879
NONE OF THAT IS TRUE.

66
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,879
THE GUY SOLD HIS

67
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,879
HEDGE FUND.

68
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:48,459
HE SOLD HIS OWN
COMPANY.

69
00:03:48,459 --> 00:04:03,171
THEN HE WENT ON SAY, I
DIDN'T REALLY WANT IT.

70
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:14,650
ALL 
THE

71
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:26,629
INTENSITY 

72
00:04:26,629 --> 00:05:06,330
AND I WAS
TELLING YOU 

73
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:33,379
DONALD TRUMP 

74
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:39,820
IS THE BEST.

75
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,649
AS SOME POINT THIS IS GOING TO
COME BACK TO BITE DONALD TRUMP.

76
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,719
WHEN YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
LOYALTY TO ANYONE

77
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:49,719
EVER.

78
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,040
HE IS DOING IT TO JEFF SESSIONS
AS WE SPEAK AND THAT IS HIS

79
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

80
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,569
BY THE WAY,
SCARAMUCCI SAID HE IS GOING

81
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:56,610
TO FIRE EVERYBODY.

82
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,210
SO I'M GOING
TO DO IT.

83
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,210
YOU ARE GOING

84
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,129
TO STOP LEAKING OR YOU ARE GOING
TO BE FIRED.

85
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,129
TURNED OUT

86
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,999
TO BE THE OTHER WAY ACTUALLY.

87
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,839
AND THEY ARE STILL LEAKING.

88
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,599
BY THE WAY, TRUMP, IF YOU SAID
YOU GOT THIS NEW ENFORCER

89
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,819
AND YOU ARE GOING TO STOP THE
LEAKS, BUT YOU FIRE HIM,

90
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,620
THAT ENCOURAGES EVERYONE ELSE.

91
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,310
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MESS.

92
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,259
THIS IS THE ENTIRETY OF THE
STORY, TRUMP RAN HIS

93
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,319
WHOLE CAMPAIGN ON, OUR COUNTRY IS
A MESS.

94
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,469
WEíRE NOT WINNING ANYMORE.

95
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:28,279
MY GOD, IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A
MESS BEFORE, WAIT UNTIL YOU

96
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,399
GET A HOLD OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.

97
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,349
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN INCOMPETENCE
LIKE THIS AND YOU

98
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,929
WONDER WHY HE WENT BANKRUPT SIX
TIMES.

99
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:36,949
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

100
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:38,909
KNOW HOW TO MANAGE ANYTHING.

101
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,289
HIS DADDY LEFT HIM $200 MILLION,

102
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:45,389
AND THAT IS WHY WE HAD TO
BORROW MONEY FROM THE RUSSIANS.

103
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,800
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE
ANYTHING.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
HE COULDN'T MANAGE

105
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,430
HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG.

106
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,430
FROM TIME MAGAZINE.

107
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,430
AN INSTANT

108
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,400
TELEVISION CELEBRITY, SCARAMUCCIíS
OBSEQUIOUS DISPLAYS OF

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,270
LOYALTY PLEASED THE PRESIDENT,
BUT HIS ASTONISHING RISE ALSO

110
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,210
THREATENED TO OVERSHADOW THE
PRESIDENT.

111
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,210
WHAT A

112
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,660
PATHETIC HUMAN BEING DONALD
TRUMP IS.

113
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,599
HE IS LIKE, YOU DID A GOOD JOB
THERE KISSING UP TO ME, BUT

114
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,319
NOW YOU ARE BECOMING A LITTLE
BIT OF A CELEBRITY ESPECIALLY IN

115
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,449
INTERVIEW BECAUSE OF THE
CURSING BUT NOW EVERYONE IS

116
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,669
PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU AND NOT ME.

117
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,740
THINK ABOUT HOW FRAGILE YOUR EGO
HAS TO BE.

118
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,759
SOMEBODY IN MY TEAM IS DOING
WELL.

119
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,179
IF YOU THOUGHT SCARAMUCCI WAS
DOING WELL YOU HAVE ANOTHER

120
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,580
PROBLEM TOO, BUT APPARENTLY
TRUMP AGREED.

121
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
HE THOUGHT

122
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,389
HE WILL BE TOUGH,
THEN IS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE,

123
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,330
SOMEBODY PAID ATTENTION TO HIM
FOR A SECOND LONGER THAN ME.

124
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,330
HE HAS TO GO.

125
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,069
YOU HAVE TO BE
THE MOST INSECURE MAN IN

126
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,069
AMERICA.

127
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,809
BUT I'M NOT POSITIVE
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.

128
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:52,080
YESTERDAY JOHN KELLY, THE NEW
GUY AND I THINK OF COURSE THE

129
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,839
MAINSTREAM MEDIA LOVES HIM.

130
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,110
WE GO TO CNN.

131
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,960
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL SAID
SCARAMUCCI WAS REMOVED

132
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,860
FROM HIS NEW ROLE AS THE
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR

133
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,050
BECAUSE HE DID NOT THINK HE WAS
DISCIPLINED AND HAD BURNED

134
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,699
HIS CREDIBILITY.

135
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,119
TO BE FAIR, THAT IS TRUE ENOUGH.

136
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,180
JOHN KELLY IS QUITE RIGHT

137
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,339
ABOUT THAT.

138
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,259
AND FINALLY,
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID

139
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:40,389
GENERAL KELLY HAS 

140
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:47,139
A FULL
AUTHEORITY.

141
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:51,560
SCARAMUCCI DIDN'T BEND A KNEE,
BUT HE IS GONE.

142
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,589
THEY CLAIM THAT JARED KUSHNER,
IVANKA TRUMP, AND STEVE BANNON

143
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,970
ARE NOW ALL REPORTING TO THE
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF

144
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,519
WHICH IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO
BE.

145
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,959
LET'S SEE HOW THAT TURNS OUT.

146
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,889
ALL THEM ARE SAYING JOHN KELLY,
A MAN OF DISCIPLINE.

147
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:08,889
WE LOVE

148
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,040
GENERALS.

149
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,490
GOOD LUCK TRYING TO GET STEVE
BANNON UNDER CONTROL.

150
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,570
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, FIRE
THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER?

151
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,490
THIS WAS NEVER GOING TO END
BECAUSE AS SCARAMUCCI APTLY

152
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,120
PUT IT WHEN HE WAS REFERRING TO
REINCE PRIEBUS, THIS FISH

153
00:09:23,120 --> 00:00:00,000
ROTS FROM THE HEAD DOWN.
