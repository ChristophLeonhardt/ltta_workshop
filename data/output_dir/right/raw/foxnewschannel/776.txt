THE CAMPAIGN TO LEGALIZE

6
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:17,647
MARIJUANA CONTINUES TO GAIN

7
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:19,382
MOMENTUM NOT JUST THIS COUNTRY

8
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:20,616
BUT AROUND THE WORLD.

9
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:21,917
CANADA JUST LEGALIZED IT.

10
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:24,120
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNALED HIS

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,988
WILLINGNESS TO END THE FEDERAL

12
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:27,156
BAN ON MARIJUANA.

13
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:28,457
MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT IS

14
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:29,025
GREAT.

15
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:32,094
FORMER CONGRESSMAN PATRICK

16
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:33,696
KENNEDY FEELS UNEASY ABOUT IT.

17
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:35,297
HE WROTE A PIECE IN THE "WALL

00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:36,532
STREET JOURNAL" WARNING

19
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:37,566
LEGALIZING MARIJUANA COULD BE

20
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:38,901
BAD FOR KIDS AND HE WOULD SET

21
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:39,902
BACK THE CAUSE OF SOCIAL

22
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:40,269

00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:45,107
WE SPOKE TO HIM EARLIER ABOUT

24
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:45,541

ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE, ONE OF

28
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:50,713
THE ONLY DEMOCRATS TO SAY

29
00:00:50,713 --> 00:00:52,548
ANYTHING LIKE THIS OUT LOUD.

30
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:54,083
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR

31
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,184
REASONING IS.

32
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:56,218
>> WE HAVE BEEN WITH THE

33
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:57,319
EXPERIENCE OF THE CURRENT

34
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,921
OPIOID CRISIS AND EVERYBODY IS

35
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:04,727
POINTING BACK TO WHERE THEY

36
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:07,296
MARKETED THE ADDICTIVE

37
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:07,730
OXYCONTIN.

38
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,031
WHAT WAS ENDING UP HAPPENING

39
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:11,100
IS PUBLIC HEALTH GOT PUT TO

40
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,373
THE SIDELINES WHILEM PROFITS

41
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:21,944
FOR PURDUE PHARMA RULED THE

42
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:24,747
PUBLIC HEALTH.

43
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:28,451
WE GO BACK A GENERATION TO THE

44
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,151
TOBACCO INDUSTRY SETTLEMENT

45
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:30,686
AND HOW WE HAD TO LEARN FOR A

46
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:31,887
LONG TIME TO THE FACT THAT

47
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:34,857
THERE WAS AN APICKTIVE

48
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,759
SUBSTANCE -- ADDICTIVE

49
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,928
SUBSTANCE IN NICOTINE

50
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:39,895
MARKETING THE COMMERCIAL

51
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:41,464
MARKETING OF THE CIGARETTES.

52
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:43,299
SO WITH ALL OF THAT KNOWLEDGE

53
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,434
WHY WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE

54
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:49,238
IS A NEW COMMERCIAL PUSH, TO

55
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:52,041
PUSH A PRODUCT OUT CALLED

56
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,210
MARIJUANA THERE THERE WOULDN'T

57
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,347
BE A DELETERIOUS IMPACT ON THE

58
00:01:58,347 --> 00:01:58,948
PUBLIC HEALTH?

59
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:00,716
ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT

60
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:01,951
LEGALIZATION MEANS

61
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:02,451
COMMERCIALIZATION.

62
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:03,385
WHICH REALLY MEANS --

63
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:04,687
>> Tucker: WAIT A SECOND.

64
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:06,088
WAIT A SECOND, CONGRESSMAN.

65
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:08,289
WE KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE

66
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,458
MARIJUANA COMPANIES ARE COOL,

67
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,059
PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE.

68
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,427
THEY ARE NOT IN THIS FOR THE

69
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:11,761
MONEY.

70
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,395
THEY ARE IN IT BECAUSE THEY

71
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,231
WANT TO MAKE THE WORLD A

72
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:16,031
BETTER PLACE.

73
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:17,399
WHY DON'T YOU TRUST THEM?

74
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,801
>> WELL, THAT IS THE THING WE

75
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:21,570
HAVE TO ASK OF OURSELVES.

76
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,405
ARE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

77
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:27,610
NOW GOING INTO INVESTING INTO

78
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,644
CANNABIS AND IN THE MANY

79
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:31,113
PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING

80
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:32,548
PRODUCED?

81
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:38,654
I MIGHT ADD ELIXIRS THE

82
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:40,222
PHANTOM GRAPE AID AND ORANGE

83
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:41,657
AID THAT WE GREW UP WITH

84
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:42,925
INFUSED WITH THE MARIJUANA

85
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,293
INFUSED T.H.C.

86
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,895
BEYOND JUST THE BROWNIES, THE

87
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,263
MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS NOW

88
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:48,397
INFUSING GUMMY BEARS.

89
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:51,834
THEY ARE INFUSING THINGS LIKE

90
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:52,201
POT-TARTS.

91
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,003
OTHER FOOD EDIBLES IS WHAT

92
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:54,670
THEY ARE KNOWN.

93
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,840
IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS A

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,243
REALLY SLICK, VERY SMART

95
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:03,045
MARKETING EFFORT IF YOU HAVE

96
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:05,114
MONEY ON THE LINE BEHIND THE

97
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:05,648
MARIJUANA INDUSTRY.

98
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,316
YOU ARE STANDING TO GAIN A LOT

99
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:09,785
OF MONEY IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

100
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:11,287
AND YET, WHO IS GOING TO BE

101
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:14,089
THE BIGGEST ONE TO PAY FOR ALL

102
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:14,456
OF THIS?

103
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,858
IT WILL BE THE PUBLIC HEALTH

104
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,193
THAT PAYS THE COST OF THIS.

105
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:18,427
IT WILL BE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

106
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:21,096
ARE GOING TO THINK THAT THIS

107
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,332
IS AN EASY ALTERNATIVE FOR ME

108
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:26,435
TO DEAL WITH MY STRESS AND

109
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:27,670
ANXIETY BECAUSE NOW I HAVE ALL

110
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,470
THE CHOICES.

111
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,806
I CAN DRINK IT, I CAN SMOKE

112
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:31,874
IT, I CAN EAT IT.

113
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:34,643
WHATEVER WILL HELP ME PEOPLE

114
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:35,778
LESS ANXIOUS.

115
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:38,280
AND FRANKLY, TUCKER, AMIDST

116
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,481
THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE

117
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:40,983
ADDICTION CRISIS IT'S SHOCKING

118
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:42,651
WE ARE NOT ASKING A MORE

119
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:44,086
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, WHAT ARE

120
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:46,488
WE DOING TO HELP OUR YOUNG

121
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:47,756
PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR STRESS,

122
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:51,160
COPE WITH THEIR PROBLEMS,

123
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,561
NAVIGATE THEIR ANXIETYS?

124
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:53,462
>> Tucker: THAT IS RIGHT.

125
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:54,230
>> THAT SHOULD BE THE

126
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,164
CHALLENGE ON THE COUNTRY RIGHT

127
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:55,731
NOW.

128
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:57,233
YET, I THINK WE ARE SELLING

129
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,068
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DOWN THE

130
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,769
RIVER BY ALLOWING A NEW

131
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:01,804
PREDATORY BUSINESS THAT FEEDS

132
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:04,006
OFF OF ADDICTION, THAT MAKES

133
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,542
MONEY OFF OF GETTING PEOPLE

134
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:06,876
HOOKED.

135
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,344
I THINK IT'S BAD FOR THE

136
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:10,346
PUBLIC HEALTH OF THIS COUNTRY.

137
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,280
>> I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.

138
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,882
BY THE WAY, I SHOULD NOTE FOR

139
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,550
THE VIEWERS WHO DON'T KNOW YOU

140
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,451
PERSONALLY OVERCAME ADDICTION

141
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,019
TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL WITHOUT

142
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,988
THE USE OF MORE DRUGS AND

143
00:04:19,988 --> 00:00:00,000
ALCOHOL AND YOU ARE A BETTER
