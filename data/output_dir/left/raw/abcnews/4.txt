1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,839
>> WE'VE COVERED A GREAT DEAL OF

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,106
TERRITORY.

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,708
I JUST LEFT, AS YOU KNOW, PRIME 

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,443
MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN, WE'RE 

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:15,715
STARTING TRADE TALKS WITH JAPAN.

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,183
THEY WERE NOT WILLING FOR YEARS 

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,585
TO TALK TRADE AND NOW THEY'RE 

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,620
WILLING TO TALK TRADE AND I'M 

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,988
SURE WE'LL MAKE A VERY GOOD 

10
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:22,188
DEAL.

11
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,357
JUST CONCLUDED, AS YOU KNOW, TWO

12
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,125
DAYS AGO, SIGNED A DEAL WITH 

13
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,327
SOUTH KOREA, TRADE DEAL, 

14
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:29,229
TREMENDOUS DEAL WITH SOUTH 

15
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:29,462
KOREA.

16
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,365
MEANS A LOT OF BUSINESS FOR OUR 

17
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:32,598
FARMERS.

18
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:34,234
WE'RE OPENING UP FOR FARMERS.

19
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,802
WE'RE OPENING UP FOR A LOT OF 

20
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,636
DIFFERENT GROUPS.

21
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,404
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL 

22
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:40,606
MUCH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER

23
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:42,075
OF AUTOMOBILES THAT WE WERE 

24
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,676
ALLOWED UNDER A DEAL THAT WAS 

25
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:44,677
TOTALLY DEFECTIVE THAT WAS THERE

26
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,246
BEFORE.

27
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,580
AND SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH 

28
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:47,881
THAT.

29
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,483
THAT DEAL IS ACTUALLY CONCLUDED.

30
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,185
WE'RE VERY WELL ALONG THE WAY 

31
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,286
WITH MEXICO, THE RELATIONSHIP IS

32
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,255
VERY GOOD AND WITH CANADA, WE'LL

33
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,723
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

34
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,558
THEY CHARGE US 300% TARIFFS ON 

35
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:01,828
DAIRY PRODUCTS, WE CAN'T HAVE 

36
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,028
THAT.

37
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:02,929
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

38
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,830
WITH CHINA, AS YOU KNOW, WE PUT 

39
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,066
OUT AN ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY, THEY 

40
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,068
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME LOSE AN 

41
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:09,769
ELECTION BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER 

42
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,472
BEEN CHALLENGED LIKE THIS, BUT I

43
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,407
WANT TO OPEN UP CHINA TO OUR 

44
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,275
FARMERS AND TO OUR 

45
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,444
INDUSTRIALISTS AND OUR COMPANIES

46
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:19,646
AND CHINA IS NOT OPEN, BUT WE'RE

47
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,749
OPEN TO THEM.

48
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,353
THEY CHARGE US 25%, 35%, 55% FOR

49
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,421
THINGS AND WE CHARGE THEM 

50
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,689
NOTHING IN TERMS OF COMING INTO 

51
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,457
THE COUNTRY.

52
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:33,626
CARS, THEY'RE 25% AND WE'RE AT 

53
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,895
2% AND 2.5% AND DON'T EVEN 

54
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,363
COLLECT IT, BUT WE COLLECT IT 

55
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:37,529
NOW.

56
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:42,335
SO, WE'RE DOING VERY WELL IN OUR

57
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,971
SITUATION WITH CHINA, ON TRADE.

58
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,406
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

59
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:50,843
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA, 

60
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:51,176
PRESIDENT XI.

61
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:54,180
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE A TWO-WAY 

62
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,413
STREET.

63
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,549
FOR 25 YEARS OR LONGER, IT WAS 

64
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:56,715
NOT.

65
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,451
AND TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF 

66
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,020
DOLLARS WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE 

67
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,922
UNITED STATES FOR THE BENEFIT OF

68
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:03,122
CHINA.

69
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,792
WE JUST CAN'T HAVE THAT.

70
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,292
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FAIR.

71
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,196
SO, WE'RE AT $250 BILLION NOW AT

72
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,400
25% INTEREST AND A LOT OF MONEY 

73
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,735
IS COME SPOOGING INTO OUR COFFE.

74
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,172
AND IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT 

75
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:23,376
ON OUR COMPANY, WHICH I SAID IT 

76
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:23,643
WOULDN'T.

77
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,845
IN FACT, STEEL IS LIKE THE 

78
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:26,378
HOTTEST INDUSTRY THERE IS.

79
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,313
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED 

80
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,616
WITH STEEL, WE'RE CHARGING A 25%

81
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,883
TARIFF FOR THE DUMPERS.

82
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,652
THEY DUMP MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF 

83
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,320
STEEL, THEY WANT TO PUT THE 

84
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,659
STEEL COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS.

85
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,293
THEY'LL COME IN AND CHARGE FIVE 

86
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,327
TIMES MORE THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT

87
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:41,594
POSSIBLE.

88
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,329
WE NEED STEEL AND WE NEED 

89
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,263
ALUMINUM AND THOSE INDUSTRIES 

90
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:45,932
ARE DOING WELL, BUT STEEL IS 

91
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,332
INCREDIBLE.

92
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,167
U.S. STEEL IS OPENING UP A 

93
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,170
MINIMUM OF EIGHT PLANTS.

94
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,506
NEWCORE IS OPENING UP PLANTS, 

95
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,742
THESE ARE BIG PLANTS.

96
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,111
$750 MILLION, $1 BILLION PLANTS,

97
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,112
IN SOME CASES.

98
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,079
SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE 

99
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,080
STEEL INDUSTRY IS VERY EXCITING 

100
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,914
TO ME.

101
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,983
IT'S BEING REBUILT OVERNIGHT.

102
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,818
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MINERS AND 

103
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,956
COAL, IF YOU LOOK AT ENERGY, 

104
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,490
LNG, JAPAN JUST GAVE US SOME 

105
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,758
NUMBERS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE.

106
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,694
THEY'RE DOUBLING THE AMOUNT THAT

107
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,361
THEY'RE GOING TO BE BUYING FOR 

108
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,864
JAPAN.

109
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,766
THEY'RE TAKING THE LNG AND 

110
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,201
THEY'RE DOUBLING IT UP.

111
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,802
I SAID, YOU HAVE TO DO ME A 

112
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,938
FAVOR, WE DON'T WANT THESE BIG 

113
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:26,205
DEFICITS.

114
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,674
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUY 

115
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,474
MORE.

116
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,809
THEY'RE BUYING MASSIVE AMOUNTS 

117
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:30,810
OF EQUIPMENT AND MILITARY 

118
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,880
EQUIPMENT AND OTHER COUNTRIES 

119
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,048
ARE DOING THE SAME THING.

120
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,985
BECAUSE WE HAVE TRADE IMBALANCES

121
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:39,452
WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY.

122
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,052
IT'S A RARE EXCEPTION THAT WE 

123
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:40,553
DON'T.

124
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:46,326
SO, WE ARE DOING GREAT AS A 

125
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:46,559
COUNTRY.

126
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,793
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY JUST RAISED 

127
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,262
INTEREST RATES A LITTLE BIT.

128
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,229
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT, 

129
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,664
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE 

130
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,198
A QUESTION.

131
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,399
I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

132
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,302
I'D RATHER PAY DOWN DEBT OR DO 

133
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:01,174
OTHER THINGS, CREATE MORE  JOBS 

134
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,075
SO, I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT 

135
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,510
THAT THEY SEEM TO LIKE RAISING 

136
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,578
INTEREST RATES.

137
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,813
WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS WITH THE 

138
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:08,013
MONEY.

139
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:11,384
AND -- BUT THEY RAISED THEM, AND

140
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,451
THEY'RE RAISING THEM BECAUSE 

141
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,053
WE'RE DOING SO WELL.

142
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:14,720
WE'RE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN I 

143
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,024
HAD PROJECTED IN TERMS OF WHEN I

144
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,225
WAS CAMPAIGNING, I SAID WE WERE 

145
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,526
GOING TO DO THIS AND WE'RE DOING

146
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,796
MUCH BETTER THAN -- THAN ANYBODY

147
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,998
EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

148
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,099
AND I WILL SAY, IF OTHERS GOT

149
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,969
IN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST THE 

150
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,970
OPPOSITE, BECAUSE THEY WERE 

151
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,171
GOING TO PUT RESTRICTIONS ON, 

152
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,573
THEY WERE GOING TO PUT 

153
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,640
REGULATIONS ON, THEY WERE GOING 

154
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,409
TO CHOKE THE ECONOMY AS IT WAS 

155
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,309
ALREADY CHOKING, BUT IT WOULD 

156
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,377
HAVE BEEN WORSE AND THEY WERE 

157
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:39,812
GOING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, 

158
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,047
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO NOW,

159
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,648
IF THEY EVER GOT CONTROL.

160
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,883
WHICH I DON'T THINK THEY'LL HAVE

161
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,818
CONTROL FOR A LONG TIME.

162
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,119
SO, WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE'LL 

163
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,791
TAKE SOME QUESTIONS AND, YES, 

164
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,893
PLEASE, JOHN, GO AHEAD.

165
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:54,894
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

166
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,228
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY

167
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,230
MUCH.

168
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,898
OF COURSE, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING 

169
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,133
FORWARD TO TOMORROW IS THE 

170
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,168
HEARINGS WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

171
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,636
BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

172
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,704
>> YES, YES.

173
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,672
>> IN 1991, WHEN JOE BIDEN 

174
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,642
PASSED A LAW INTO THE BUSH 41 

175
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,843
WHITE HOUSE, THE ALLEGATIONS 

176
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,012
THAT AKNEE THAT HILL RAISED 

177
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,047
AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS, THE 

178
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,082
BUSH WHITE HOUSE ASKED THE FBI 

179
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,984
TO LOOK INTO IT AS PART OF JUDGE

180
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,218
THOMAS' BACKGROUND 

181
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:19,551
INVESTIGATION.

182
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:20,553
NOT A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, 

183
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,088
BUT THE BACKGROUND 

184
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:22,488
INVESTIGATION.

185
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,990
WHEN THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE 

186
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,391
RAISED, WHY DIDN'T THIS WHITE 

187
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,660
HOUSE DO THE SAME THING, AND 

188
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,228
WITH ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT

189
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,130
ARE COMING OUT NOW ABOUT JUDGE 

190
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,499
KAVANAUGH, WAS THERE AN 

191
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,968
OPPORTUNITY MISSED HERE TO HAVE 

192
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,070
INVESTIGATIORS LOOK INTO THIS AD

193
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,572
GET SOME SORT OF CLARITY ONE WAY

194
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,239
OR THE OTHER?

195
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,740
>> WELL, THE FBI TOLD US, 

196
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,610
THEY'VE INVESTIGATED JUDGE 

197
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,512
KAVANAUGH SIX TIMES, FIVE TIMES,

198
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,880
MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS.

199
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,949
THEY KNOW HIM VERY WELL.

200
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,018
BUT HERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO 

201
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,120
INVESTIGATE, FROM AT LEAST ONE 

202
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,288
STANDPOINT, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE

203
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,990
LOCATION, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE 

204
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,624
TIME, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE YEAR.

205
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,224
THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

206
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,027
AND IT'S LIKE, WHERE DO YOU GO?

207
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,462
ALSO, IT'S NOT FOR THE FBI, IF 

208
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,031
YOU LOOK AT WHAT JOE BIDEN SAID,

209
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,767
HE SAID THEY DON'T DO THIS, AND 

210
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,001
HE SAID IT VERY CLEARLY, SO -- I

211
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,639
THINK WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT

212
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,773
ALL, IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE 

213
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,677
ANY OF THE DEMOCRATS' MINDS.

214
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,679
THEY'RE OBSTRUCTIONISTS.

215
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,180
THEY'RE ACTUALLY CON ARTISTS, 

216
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,982
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW QUALITY 

217
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,416
THIS MAN IS, AND THEY'VE 

218
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,651
DESTROYED A MAN'S REPUTATION AND

219
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,986
THEY WANT TO DESTROY IT EVEN 

220
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,353
MORE.

221
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,687
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 

222
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,889
SEE THAT IN THE MIDTERMS.

223
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,557
WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THIS 

224
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,691
FAMILY, WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO 

225
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,926
THESE CHILDREN, THESE BEAUTIFUL 

226
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,061
CHILDREN OF HIS AND WHAT THEY'VE

227
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,730
DONE TO HIS WIFE, AND THEY KNOW 

228
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,033
IT'S A BIG, FAT CON JOB.

229
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:41,968
AND THEY GO INTO A ROOM AND I 

230
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,671
GUARANTEE YOU THEY LAUGH LIKE 

231
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,307
HELL AS WHAT THEY PULLED OFF ON 

232
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,777
YOU AND ON THE PUBLIC.

233
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:52,244
THEY LAUGH LIKE HELL.

234
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,045
SO, IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF

235
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,180
THE FBI CAME BACK WITH THE 

236
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,049
CLEANEST SCORE AND YOU 

237
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,150
UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL, JOHN.

238
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,951
IF THEY WOULD HAVE COME BACK 

239
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:03,756
WITH THE MOST PERFECT, WE FOUND 

240
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,158
EVERYTHING AND HE'S PERFECTLY 

241
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,426
INNOCENT OF EVERYTHING, IT 

242
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,327
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

243
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,795
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN ONE 

244
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:09,995
VOTE.

245
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,164
NOW, WE WILL GET VOTES FROM THE 

246
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,165
DEMOCRATS IF WE WIN.

247
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,468
YOU'LL HAVE THREE, FOUR OR FIVE 

248
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,472
DEMOCRATS GIVING US VOTES, 

249
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,573
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN STATES THAT I

250
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,174
WON BY 30 AND 40 POINTS AND 

251
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,076
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE US VOTES.

252
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,745
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, YOU 

253
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,747
PROBABLY WON'T GET ANY, JOHN.

254
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,080
YES, GO AHEAD.

255
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,749
PLEASE.

256
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,450
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THERE ARE NOW 

257
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,686
THREE WOMEN ACCUSING JUDGE 

258
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,254
KAVANAUGH OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

259
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,723
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ALL THREE OF

260
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,325
THOSE WOMEN ARE LIARS?

261
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,093
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE 

262
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,194
SAID TOMORROW THAT COULD CAUSE 

263
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:43,696
YOU TO WITHDRAW THE NOMINATION?

264
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,630
ANYTHING AT ALL -- 

265
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,432
>> I WON'T GET INTO THAT GAME.

266
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,833
I ONLY TELL YOU THIS.

267
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,400
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST 

268
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,738
QUALITY PEOPLE THAT I'VE EVER 

269
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,272
MET.

270
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,575
AND EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS HIM 

271
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,008
SAYS THE SAME THING.

272
00:07:56,008 --> 00:08:00,312
AND THESE ARE ALL FALSE, TO ME, 

273
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:03,583
THESE ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS IN 

274
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,117
CERTAIN CASES AND CERTAIN CASES,

275
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,753
EVEN THE MEDIA AGREES WITH THAT.

276
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,023
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT WHAT THEY'VE

277
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,927
DONE TO THIS MAN IS INCREDIBLE.

278
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,695
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY INTERESTING,

279
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:19,599
I PICK A LOT OF JUDGES, I HAVE 

280
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,700
145 JUDGES I WILL BE PICKING BY 

281
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,268
THE END OF A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD

282
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,338
OF TIME, BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA

283
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,605
WASN'T BIG ON PICKING JUDGES.

284
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,207
WHEN INGOT THERE, I SAID, WHO IS

285
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,309
THIS POSSIBLE?

286
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,748
I HAVE 145, INCLUDING COURT OF 

287
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:36,115
APPEALS JUDGES.

288
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,416
AND THEY JUST DIDN'T DO IT, YOU 

289
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,183
KNOW WHY?

290
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:41,253
THEY GOT TIRED, THEY GOT 

291
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:41,553
COMPLACENT.

292
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,020
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

293
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,457
I HAVE 145 JUDGES.

294
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,092
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A FEDERAL 

295
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:46,425
JUDGE.

296
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,694
NOT JUST A SUPREME COURT JUDGE, 

297
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,062
I'M TALKING ABOUT COURT OF 

298
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:50,629
APPEALS, I'M TALKING ABOUT 

299
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,465
DISTRICT COURT.

300
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,598
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO 

301
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:55,134
WANT TO SO MUCH, I'LL BE CALLING

302
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,202
PEOPLE AND WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE 

303
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,638
CALLING PEOPLE THAT DO THIS AND 

304
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:00,272
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SCARED, 

305
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:03,342
BECAUSE WE COULD SAY IT ABOUT 

306
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,878
YOU, 35 YEARS AGO, YOU MET -- 

307
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,080
AND YOU MIGHT KNOW -- YOU MIGHT 

308
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,781
NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

309
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,682
WHAT IS GOING ON?

310
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,519
WHY DID THEY WAIT SO LONG?

311
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,788
WHY DID SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAIT 

312
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,289
UNTIL THE HEARINGS WERE OVER AND

313
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:18,524
MAKE THIS CASE?

314
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,759
WHY DIDN'T SHE BRING IT RIGHT AT

315
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,261
THE BEGINNING, WHEN YOU ASKED 

316
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,430
ABOUT, AS AN EXAMPLE, THE FBI, 

317
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,264
WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING THIS RIGHT

318
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,332
AT THE BEGINNING?

319
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,767
DURING THE HEARING?

320
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,634
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ALL THE TIME 

321
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,770
IN THE WORLD FOR THE FBI, IT 

322
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,504
WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

323
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,372
NOW, THE FBI, AS YOU KNOW, DID 

324
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,341
INVESTIGATE THIS TIME, AS THEY 

325
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,109
HAVE FIVE OR SIX OTHER TIMES, 

326
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,745
AND THEY DID A VERY THOROUGH 

327
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,548
INVESTIGATION, BUT THIS IS A BIG

328
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:42,781
CON JOB.

329
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,750
AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN THE 

330
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,986
ROOM WITH THE DEMOCRATS, CLOSE 

331
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,890
THE DOOR, YOU GUYS ARE ALL AWAY 

332
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,759
OUTSIDE WAITING AND SCHUMER AND 

333
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,028
HIS BUDDIES ARE ALL IN THERE 

334
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,264
LAUGHING, HOW WE FOOLED YOU ALL.

335
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,899
LET'S JUST STOP THEM, A BIG, FAT

336
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,099
CON.

337
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,769
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IF I CAN 

338
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,203
FOLLOW UP.

339
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,270
IF YOU HAVE DAUGHTERS.

340
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,972
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY A VICTIM 

341
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:07,840
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD NOT 

342
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,908
REPORT IT AT THE TIME?

343
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:09,875
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND -- 

344
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,945
>> BY THE WAY, I ONLY SAY THIS.

345
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,348
36 YEARS, NO CHARGE, NO 

346
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:17,016
NOTHING -- 

347
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,718
>> BUT THAT HAPPENS OFTEN.

348
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,918
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 

349
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:20,553
MAKE A DECISION.

350
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,855
36 YEARS, THERE'S NO CHARGE.

351
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,990
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE HEARINGS 

352
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,760
ARE OVER AND THE RUMORS START 

353
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,396
COMING OUT AND THEN YOU HAVE 

354
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,365
THIS OTHER CON ARTIST, AVENATTI,

355
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,334
COME OUT WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY 

356
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:35,534
TODAY.

357
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,169
ONLY I SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK

358
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,737
AT THE FACTS, THE SENATORS ARE 

359
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,405
VERY CAPABLE PEOPLE, THEY'RE 

360
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,041
VERY GOOD PEOPLE, I KNOW MANY OF

361
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,675
THEM, THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE.

362
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,211
THESE ARE VERY TALENTED, VERY 

363
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,312
GOOD PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE GOING 

364
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:47,813
TO VOTE.

365
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,014
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BELIEVE

366
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:50,349
WHAT THEY BELIEVE.

367
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,952
I CAN -- WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S 

368
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,487
HAPPENED TO THE REPUTATION OF A 

369
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:59,692
GREAT GENTLEMAN, A GREAT 

370
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,927
INTELLECT, A BRILLIANT MAN, 

371
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,262
SOMEBODY WHO HAS A CHANCE TO BE 

372
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,065
ONE OF OUR GREAT SUPREME COURT 

373
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,399
JUSTICES IN HISTORY INTELLECT 

374
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,937
CHULLY, I THINK IT'S A CHANGE.

375
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,640
YES, PLEASE.

376
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,542
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY AT 

377
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,142
THE SPEECH, AT THE U.N., YOU 

378
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:20,813
SPOKE ABOUT HOW VENEZUELA'S 

379
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,482
PROBLEM WAS BECAUSE OF CUBA AND 

380
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,984
THE CASTROS, HOW THEY WENT IN 

381
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,819
THERE AND THEY BROUGHT SOCIALISM

382
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,488
AND COMMUNISM TO VENEZUELA AND 

383
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,590
NOW TO NICARAGUA, AS WELL.

384
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,925
MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU GOING TO 

385
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,894
BE MORE PROACTIVE NOW AGAINST 

386
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,394
CUBA, AS WELL?

387
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,729
>> I'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE 

388
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,429
AGAINST CUBA.

389
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,765
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

390
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,233
CUBA.

391
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,368
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA 

392
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,535
GAVE THEM A PASS, AND I DIDN'T 

393
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:44,503
LIKE IT.

394
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,971
NEITHER DO CUBAN PEOPLE, BASED 

395
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,773
IN MIAMI AND BASED IN OUR 

396
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,641
COUNTRY THAT CAME FROM CUBA AND 

397
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:50,910
SUFFERED IN CUBA.

398
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,945
I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE DID.

399
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,314
I'VE ENDED MUCH OF IT, MOST OF 

400
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:55,480
IT.

401
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,550
I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

402
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,418
CUBA AND I CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE 

403
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,787
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN VENEZUELA.

404
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:02,288
YES, PLEASE.

405
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:02,988
GO AHEAD.

406
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,423
>> MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TO FINISH

407
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,791
REALLY FAST, YOU SAID ALSO THAT 

408
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,594
YOU HAD A CALL TO ACTION TO ASK 

409
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,662
THE LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD TO 

410
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,496
ALSO END SOCIALISM.

411
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:12,998
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 

412
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:13,331
RECOGNIZED -- 

413
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:14,900
>> WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT 

414
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,235
SOCIALISM HAS BEEN WORKING 

415
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,504
REALLY WELL AROUND THE WORLD.

416
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,806
YOU CAN LOOK AT VENEZUELA, YOUR 

417
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,374
NUMBER ONE, I GUESS THE ONE 

418
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,676
THAT'S MOST OBVIOUS, BUT YOU 

419
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,411
TAKE A LOOK AROUND THE WORLD, 

420
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,780
SOCIALISM IS NOT EXACTLY RIDING 

421
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:27,980
HIGH.

422
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,381
PLEASE.

423
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:34,220
GO AHEAD.

424
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,920
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

425
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,692
IF YOU DON'T MIND, AFTER I'M 

426
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,360
FINISHED, IF ONE OF OUR FEMALE 

427
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,060
COLLEAGUES COULD GO AFTER ME, 

428
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,562
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

429
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,663
MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TO FOLLOW UP

430
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,498
ON THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST -- 

431
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:49,034
>> WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?

432
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:49,267
EXPLAIN?

433
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:49,768
WHAT IS -- 

434
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,969
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF 

435
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,504
A FEMALE REPORTER -- 

436
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,539
>> WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

437
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,342
>> IT WOULD BE GREAT IF A FEMALE

438
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,110
REPORTER WOULD ASK YOU A 

439
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,844
QUESTION ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

440
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,079
>> I WOULDN'T MIND IT AT ALL.

441
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,913
>> LET ME -- 

442
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,980
>> WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE 

443
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,247
TO ME.

444
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,015
GO AHEAD.

445
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,517
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON JON 

446
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,620
AND JOHN'S QUESTION, WHY IS IT, 

447
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,987
MR. PRESIDENT, THAT YOU ALWAYS 

448
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:11,790
SEEM TO SIDE WITH THE ACCUSED 

449
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,058
AND NOT THE ACCUSER?

450
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,460
YOU HAVE THREE WOMEN HERE WHO 

451
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,495
ARE ALL MAKING ALLEGATIONS, WHO 

452
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,030
ARE ALL ASKING THAT THEIR 

453
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,165
STORIES BE HEARD, AND, YOU KNOW,

454
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,433
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE OF ROY 

455
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,502
MOORE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE 

456
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,971
OF ONE OF YOUR STAFFERS, YOU 

457
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,773
SEEM TO, TIME AND AGAIN, SIDE 

458
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,741
WITH THE ACCUSED AND NOT THE 

459
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:30,008
ACCUSER.

460
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,277
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MANY 

461
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,580
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU'VE HAD MADE

462
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,514
AGAINST YOU OVER THE YEARS IN. 

463
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,850
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WASN'T 

464
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,284
HAPPY WITH ROY MOORE, LET'S GET 

465
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,153
THAT STRAIGHT, BUT ROY MOORE WAS

466
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:41,920
A -- 

467
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,756
>> YOU STOOD BY HIM.

468
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,124
>> A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, AND I

469
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,625
WOULD HAVE RATHER HAD A 

470
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,859
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WIN.

471
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,195
I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH LUTHER 

472
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:51,764
STRANGE, WHO WAS A TERRIFIC MAN 

473
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,133
FROM ALABAMA, BUT LUTHER STRANGE

474
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,101
HAD A LOT OF THINGS GOING 

475
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,136
AGAINST HIM.

476
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,438
AS FAR AS WOMEN, WHETHER IT'S A 

477
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,507
MAN OR A WOMAN, THESE ARE, YOU 

478
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,942
KNOW, IT CAN HAPPEN THE OTHER 

479
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,775
WAY, ALLEGATIONS CAN GO THE 

480
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,743
OTHER WAY, ALSO.

481
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,278
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

482
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,114
AND WHETHER IT WAS A MAN OR A 

483
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,150
WOMAN, 30 YEARS AGO, 36 YEARS 

484
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,784
AGO, IN FACT, THEY DON'T EVEN 

485
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:17,256
KNOW HOW MANY YEARS AGO BECAUSE 

486
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,390
NOBODY NO

487
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:18,924
KNOWS WHAT THE TIME IS.

488
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,359
AND I COULD PICK AS AN EXAMPLE, 

489
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,660
HOPEFULLY I WON'T HAVE TO DO IT 

490
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,828
AS A REPLACEMENT, BECAUSE 

491
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,962
HOPEFULLY THIS IS GOING TO GO 

492
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,197
VERY WELL ON THURSDAY, IT'S 

493
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,297
GOING TO GO VERY WELL ON MONDAY 

494
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:28,067
OR SATURDAY OR SUNDAY OR 

495
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,936
WHENEVER THEY VOTE, BUT I COULD 

496
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:35,073
PICK A WOMAN AND SHE COULD HAVE 

497
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:36,775
CHARGES MADE FROM MANY YEARS AGO

498
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:36,975
ALSO.

499
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,143
>> BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, 

500
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:38,577
SIR -- 

501
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,511
>> I WOULD LOOK AT THE 

502
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,512
CHARACTER -- WHAT I HAVE TO 

503
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,080
DO -- 

504
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,317
>> YOU'VE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT 

505
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:45,850
THESE ACCUSERS. 

506
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,553
>>> DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE 

507
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,023
RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD.

508
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,192
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE 

509
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:53,826
TO SPEAK -- EXCUSE ME.

510
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,828
THEY HAVE A MAJOR CHANCE TO 

511
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,562
SPEAK.

512
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,896
AND IT WILL BE TOMORROW, I 

513
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,032
ASSUME.

514
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,267
WE'VE DELAYED THIS, MEANING THE 

515
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,570
REPUBLICAN SENATORS, NOT ME, THE

516
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,171
REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE DELAYED

517
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,675
THIS FOR WEEKS NOW.

518
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,777
THEY'RE GIVING THE WOMEN A MAJOR

519
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,779
CHANCE TO SPEAK.

520
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,247
NOW IT'S POSSIBLE I'LL HEAR THAT

521
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,649
AND I'LL SAY, HEY, I'M CHANGING 

522
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:18,117
MY MIND.

523
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,818
THAT IS POSSIBLE.

524
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,620
WE WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO

525
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,888
SPEAK.

526
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,056
>> ALL THREE SHOULD HAVE THE 

527
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:24,289
CHANCE?

528
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,458
>> WELL, WHOEVER IS GIVEN A 

529
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,125
CHANCE, WE'VE DELAYED IT A LONG 

530
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,094
TIME.

531
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,162
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG 

532
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,298
SHOT AT MAKING THEIR CASE, AND, 

533
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,667
YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN BE 

534
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,035
PERSUADED, ALSO, OKAY?

535
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:39,772
YES, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

536
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,139
GO AHEAD.

537
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,307
I'D LIKE TO GO -- YES, GO AHEAD,

538
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:43,809
PLEASE.

539
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,910
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

540
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,712
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO

541
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,280
FOLLOW UP ON SOME ANSWERS THAT I

542
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,648
DIDN'T HEAR IF YOU, IF YOU WOULD

543
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,283
ALLOW ME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

544
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,718
FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU THINK THESE

545
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:57,756
WOMEN, ALL THREE OF THEM, ARE 

546
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:57,956
LIARS?

547
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,725
Y YES OR NO?

548
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,492
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU.

549
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,127
I JUST HEARD ABOUT ONE A LITTLE 

550
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,394
WHILE AGO.

551
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,362
I CAN TELL YOU HER LAWYER IS A 

552
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:06,031
LOW LIFE, OKAY?

553
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,232
SO, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER OR 

554
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,634
NOT THEY'RE LIARS UNTIL I HEAR 

555
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:08,834
THEM.

556
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:09,434
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED 

557
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:11,170
TODAY, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN VERY 

558
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,571
BUSY WITH JAPAN, WITH SOUTH 

559
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,907
KOREA WITH CHINA AND ABOUT SEVEN

560
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,508
OTHER COUNTRIES, AND I CHAIRED 

561
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,709
THE SECURITY COUNCIL.

562
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,879
SO, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TODAY'S 

563
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,980
PERSON THAT CAME FORWARD.

564
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,483
I DO KNOW ABOUT THE LAWYER AND 

565
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,852
YOU DON'T GET MUCH WORSE, BAD 

566
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:27,986
REPUTATION, TO TAKE A LOOK AT 

567
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,855
HIS PAST, SO, AS FAR AS THE 

568
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,723
OTHER WOMEN ARE CONCERNED, I'M 

569
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:32,257
GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS 

570
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,392
TOMORROW.

571
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,461
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING, YOU 

572
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:35,994
KNOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

573
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,932
I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT'S SAID.

574
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,967
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL BE 

575
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:42,301
CONVINCING.

576
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:46,371
NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING 

577
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,040
SAID, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS 

578
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,308
BEEN, FOR MANY YEARS, ONE OF THE

579
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,009
MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE IN 

580
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,309
WASHINGTON.

581
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,245
HE'S BEEN ON, I GUESS YOU'D CALL

582
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,615
IT THE SECOND-HIGHEST COURT.

583
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,217
AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO 

584
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,052
KNOWS HIM, A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW 

585
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:01,854
HIM WELL.

586
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,755
AND THOSE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE 

587
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:04,423
WHAT'S GOING ON.

588
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,491
I CAN ALWAYS BE CONVINCED.

589
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:07,593
I HAVE TO HEAR IT.

590
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,827
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE 

591
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,497
SAYING IS, THERE IS A SITUATION,

592
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,732
THERE IS A SCENARIO UNDERWHICH 

593
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,700
YOU WOULD WITHDRAW THE 

594
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,000
NOMINATION.

595
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,933
IS THAT CORRECT?

596
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,368
>> IF I THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY OF

597
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,271
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YEAH, SURE.

598
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,172
>> YOU WILL WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW 

599
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:20,973
TO MAKE YOUR MIND?

600
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,973
>> I WANT TO WATCH.

601
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,175
I HOPE I CAN WATCH.

602
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,944
I'M MEETING WITH LOOT T OF 

603
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:26,845
COUNTRIES TOMORROW.

604
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,280
BUT I WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH.

605
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,683
AND I'LL RELY ON SOME VERY FAIR 

606
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,753
AND TALENTED REPUBLICAN SENATORS

607
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,457
WHO -- LOOK, IF WE BROUGHT 

608
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,358
GEORGE WASHINGTON HERE AND WE 

609
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,326
SAID, WE HAVE GEORGE WASHINGTON,

610
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,093
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD VOTE AGAINST

611
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,563
HIM, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND.

612
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,464
AND HE MAY HAVE HAD A BAD PAST, 

613
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:47,565
WHO KNOWS, YOU KNOW.

614
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:51,769
HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME, I THINK, 

615
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,106
ACCUSATIONS MADE.

616
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,240
DIDN'T HE HAVE A COUPLE OF 

617
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,141
THINGS IN HIS PAST?

618
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,242
GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD BE VOTED

619
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,211
AGAINST 100% BY SCHUMER AND THE 

620
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,712
CON ARTISTS.

621
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:01,914
100%, 100%.

622
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,947
SO, IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER 

623
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,650
FROM THEIR STANDPOINT.

624
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,984
THAT'S WHY WHEN JOHN ASKED ABOUT

625
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,920
THE FBI, IF THE FBI DID THE MOST

626
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,321
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IN THE 

627
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,522
HISTORY OF THE FBI AND THEY 

628
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,025
FOUND HIM TO BE 100% PERFECT, HE

629
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,427
WOULD LOSE EVERY SINGLE VOTE.

630
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,695
NOW, IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN 

631
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,562
TOMORROW, I THINK YOU'RE GOING 

632
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:19,665
TO GET SOME VOTES.

633
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,600
FROM THE DEMOCRATS, YOU KNOW 

634
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,766
WHY?

635
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,769
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHY.

636
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,469
IT'S POLITICS.

637
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,738
OKAY, LET'S GO.

638
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,405
ONE MORE QUESTION.

639
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:28,941
I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT THREE 

640
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,409
QUESTIONS, IT'S NOT FAIR TO 

641
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:30,976
EVERYONE ELSE.

642
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,543
SHOULD I LET HER ASK ANOTHER 

643
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:32,878
QUESTION?

644
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,979
GO AHEAD.

645
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,280
>> TO FOLLOW UP ON A QUESTION 

646
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,015
THAT A COLLEAGUE ASKED, AS WELL,

647
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,217
ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT 

648
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,251
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO PEOPLE 

649
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,654
LIKE ROY MOORE, TO ROGER AILES, 

650
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,989
TO BRETT KAVANAUGH, THEY'RE ALL 

651
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:44,756
MEN.

652
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,457
WHY IS THAT -- 

653
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,759
>> IT'S NOT A BENEFIT OF THE 

654
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,126
DOUBT.

655
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,963
I'VE KNOWN THEM -- I'VE KNOWN 

656
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,097
THEM FOR A LONG TIME.

657
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,232
AND A -- A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE.

658
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:54,599
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

659
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,302
AND SOME I'VE BEEN DISPOINTED 

660
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,037
WITH, I HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED 

661
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,741
WITH SOME,OTHERS, YOU KNOW, 

662
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,642
THERE ARE CHARGES THAT ARE 

663
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,243
PRETTY WEAK.

664
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,310
I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG 

665
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,511
TIME.

666
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,412
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING 

667
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:07,779
WRONG.

668
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,114
I NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING 

669
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:09,314
WRONG.

670
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,182
AND THERE ARE SOME THAT 

671
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:10,849
PROBABLY, I CAN TELL YOU, THERE 

672
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:15,420
ARE SOME THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING

673
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,121
FOR A LONG TIME AND IN A COUPLE 

674
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,823
OF CASES THEY WEREN'T 

675
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,024
REPUBLICANS, IN A LOT OF CASES, 

676
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,592
THEY WERE NOT, THEY WERE EXACTLY

677
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,926
THE OPPOSITE, BUT I'VE BEEN 

678
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:23,762
WATCHING THEM FOR A LONG TIME, 

679
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,130
AND I KNEW FOR A LONG TIME THESE

680
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,165
WERE NOT GOOD PEOPLE, AND THEY 

681
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,335
WERER IN BROUGHT UP.

682
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:30,535
OKAY.

683
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:33,939
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD.

684
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,074
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BY THE WAY.

685
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,111
THANK YOU.

686
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:39,678
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

687
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,980
WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS FIRST 

688
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,081
SURFACED, YOU INITIALLY SAID HOW

689
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,517
IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR DR. FORD TO

690
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,485
TESTIFY AND THAT YOU WANTED TO 

691
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:47,919
HEAR FROM HER.

692
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,087
>> I DO.

693
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,422
I WISH IT COULD HAVE GONE 

694
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:50,655
QUICKER.

695
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,091
>> WELL, YOU ALSO SAID THAT IF 

696
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,060
WHAT SHE SAID WERE AS BAD AS SHE

697
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,629
CLAIMS, SURELY HER OR HER 

698
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,031
PARENTS WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT.

699
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,032
AND JUST TODAY YOU SAID YOU -- 

700
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,968
>> WELL, THERE IS THE TRUTH.

701
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,069
THERE IS THE CHANCE THAT HER 

702
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,470
PARENTS COULD HAVE REPORTED IT 

703
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,071
26 YEARS AGO.

704
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,205
>> SO MY QUESTION IS -- 

705
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,440
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO 

706
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,475
REPORT IT, BECAUSE IN SOME 

707
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,777
INSTANCES, PEOPLE KEEP IT QUIET,

708
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,645
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION FOR 

709
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,312
A WOMAN, THERE'S NO QUESTION 

710
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,315
ABOUT IT.

711
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,682
AND IN SOME CASES, THEY DO 

712
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:18,884
REPORT IT.

713
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,751
FRANKLY, HAD THEIR REPORTED IT, 

714
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,821
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY 

715
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,755
AMAZING, WOULDN'T IT?

716
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,290
BUT I GUESS THEY DIDN'T, AND 

717
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,058
THAT'S OKAY.

718
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,925
I'M NOT SAYING THEY HAD TO 

719
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,592
REPORT IT.

720
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:28,827
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY PERSONAL 

721
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,395
THING, IT'S A VERY BIG PROBLEM.

722
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,297
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

723
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,767
>> DO YOU WANT TO HEAR HER STORY

724
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,502
BECAUSE -- YOU ALREADY MADE UP 

725
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,103
YOUR MIND.

726
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,771
>> THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER 

727
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,174
TIME LAST WEEK.

728
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:42,707
THIS IS THE UNITED STATES 

729
00:20:42,707 --> 00:20:43,108
SENATE.

730
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,244
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT 

731
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,446
POSITION THAT A PRESIDENT CAN 

732
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:50,916
GIVE OUT, I THINK WE CAN SAY, BY

733
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,216
FAR.

734
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,251
I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD IT'S THE 

735
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,152
MOST IMPORTANT DECISION A 

736
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,054
PRESIDENT CAN MAKE.

737
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,589
I DISAGREE WITH THAT.

738
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,691
WAR AND PEACE, I ALWAYS SAY, WAR

739
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,560
AND PEACE, AND AFTER THAT, 

740
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,329
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, RIGHT?

741
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,298
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM 

742
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,466
HER.

743
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,134
WE COULD HAVE HEAR FROM HER LAST

744
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:09,334
WEEK.

745
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,002
WE COULD HAVE HEARD FROM HER FOR

746
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:11,803
A LONG TIME.

747
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,271
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR 

748
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,774
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY, OKAY?

749
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,242
>> LET ME FOLLOW UP ON JIM'S 

750
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:19,378
QUESTION THAT I DON'T THINK WE 

751
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,345
GOT AN ANSWER TO.

752
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,148
>> WHICH ONE, WHICH QUESTION?

753
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:23,348
WHO?

754
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,883
>> HOW HAVE YOUR PERSONAL 

755
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,451
EXPERIENCES BEING ACCUSED -- 

756
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,752
>> I'VE BEEN ACCUSED.

757
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,688
FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

758
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,155
>> RIGHT.

759
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,256
>> I'VE BEEN ACCUSED.

760
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,857
AND I WAS ACCUSED BY, I BELIEVE 

761
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:36,428
IT WAS FOUR WOMEN, YOU CAN CHECK

762
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,762
WITH SEAN HANNITY, YOU CAN CHECK

763
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,331
WITH FOX, BECAUSE THEY COVERED 

764
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,733
IT VERY STRONGLY -- 

765
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,034
>> AND HOW HAVE THOSE -- 

766
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:43,702
>> EXCUSE ME.

767
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,369
I WAS ACCUSED BY FOUR OR FIVE 

768
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:46,638
WOMEN THAT GOT PAID A LOT OF 

769
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,773
MONEY TO MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT 

770
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,774
ME.

771
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,944
WE CAUGHT THEM AND THE 

772
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,779
MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSED TO PUT 

773
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:56,081
IT ON TELEVISION.

774
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,382
THEY REFUSED TO WRITE ABOUT IT.

775
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,384
THERE WERE FOUR WOMEN AND MAYBE 

776
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,420
MORE, I THINK THE NUMBER IS FOUR

777
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,288
OR FIVE, BUT ONE HAD A MORTGAGE 

778
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,224
PAID OFF HER HOUSE, $52,000.

779
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,427
ANOTHER ONE HAD OTHER THINGS 

780
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,461
HAPPEN.

781
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,430
AND THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT, I 

782
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,099
BELIEVE, WAS OFFERED $750,000 TO

783
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,000
SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT ME AND SHE 

784
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,803
IS THE ONE THAT REPORTED IT.

785
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:18,903
THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE.

786
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:20,305
SHE REPORTED IT INSTEAD OF 

787
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,908
TAKING THE MONEY.

788
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,377
SO, I'VE HAD NUMEROUS 

789
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:26,878
ACCUSATIONS ABOUT ME.

790
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,346
>> RIGHT.

791
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,381
>> THEY MADE FALSE STATEMENTS 

792
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,517
ABOUT ME, KNOWING THEY WERE 

793
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:32,951
FALSE.

794
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:33,418
I NEVER MET THEM.

795
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,986
I NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE.

796
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,055
AND WHAT DID THEY DO, WHAT DID 

797
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,723
THEY GO?

798
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:39,624
THEY TOOK MONEY IN ORDER TO SAY 

799
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,558
BAD THINGS.

800
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,260
I'VE HAD STORIES WRITTEN IN "THE

801
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,095
NEW YORK TIMES," FRONT PAGE, 

802
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:47,198
ABOUT FOUR WOMEN, THE WHOLE TOP 

803
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,967
CENTER FRONT PAGE OF "THE NEW 

804
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:49,400
YORK TIMES".

805
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,136
I THINK IT WAS FOUR BIG 

806
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,637
PICTURES, I SAID, WOW, THAT'S A 

807
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,505
BIG THING, WHAT'S THAT?

808
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,608
THESE WERE WOMEN THAT WERE 

809
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,643
QUOTED SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT 

810
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:58,809
ME.

811
00:22:58,809 --> 00:22:59,844
NOT THE WORST THINGS ABOUT ME, 

812
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,013
BUT BAD THINGS.

813
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,216
AND I SAID, GEE, THAT'S TOO BAD.

814
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,183
I KNEW THEM A LONG TIME AGO, 15,

815
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,219
20 YEARS AGO.

816
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:07,919
THAT'S TOO BAD.

817
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,187
I'M SURPRISED AT THAT.

818
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,622
AND THEN I SEE THEM ON 

819
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,889
TELEVISION, NOTHING TO DO WITH 

820
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:15,593
ME, THE NEXT DAY, OR DAY LATER, 

821
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,429
THEY WERE INCENSED, THEY SAID, 

822
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,764
DONALD TRUMP IS A NICE GUY, WE 

823
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:20,632
NEVER SAID THIS.

824
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,768
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" DID FALSE 

825
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:24,269
REPORTING.

826
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,537
THEY'RE FAKE NEWS.

827
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:26,705
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT?

828
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,339
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" WOULD NOT 

829
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:31,142
REPORT THAT THEIR STORY WAS 

830
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:31,743
FAKE.

831
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,944
THESE WOMEN SAID GREAT THINGS, 

832
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,113
NOT ONLY DID THEY NOT SAY THE 

833
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:35,947
BAD STUFF, THEY SAID GREAT 

834
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,817
THINGS ABOUT ME.

835
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,452
FRONT PAGE.

836
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,020
AND THOSE WOMEN, THEY'RE 

837
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,254
INCREDIBLE WOMEN, THEY WENT ON 

838
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,288
TELEVISION AND THEY DIDN'T WANT 

839
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:46,725
TO, AND I DIDN'T ASK THEM, AND 

840
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,493
THEY SAID "THE NEW YORK TIMES" 

841
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,227
MADE IT UP.

842
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:51,897
THEY GAVE FALSE QUOTES.

843
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,832
AND THEY WENT ON A LOT OF SHOWS,

844
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,233
THEY WERE REALLY INCENSED AND 

845
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,302
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

846
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,703
THAT'S WHY -- PEOPLE KNOW THAT A

847
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,171
LOT OF THE NEWS IS FAKE, AND A 

848
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:02,373
LOT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE 

849
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:03,374
ARE FAKE.

850
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,277
BUT 20% OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL, 

851
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:05,477
OKAY?

852
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,979
>> IF I COULD ACTUALLY ASK ME 

853
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:08,947
QUESTION, MR. TRUMP.

854
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,415
YOU DIDN'T LET ME ASK MY 

855
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:10,682
QUESTION.

856
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,783
>> YOU'VE BEEN ASKING A QUESTION

857
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,784
FOR TEN MINUTES.

858
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,451
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

859
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:17,689
>> I'M ASK ING YOU, HOW DID THOE

860
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,790
IMPACT YOUR OPINIONS ON THE 

861
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,190
ALLEGATIONS -- 

862
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,591
>> WELL, IT DOES IMPACT MY 

863
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:21,860
OPINION, BECAUSE I'VE HAD A LOT 

864
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,927
OF FALSE CHARGES MADE AGAINST 

865
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:23,428
ME.

866
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,530
I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON, 

867
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:25,863
UNFORTUNATELY.

868
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:26,531
I'VE BEEN A FAMOUS PERSON FOR A 

869
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,199
LONG TIME.

870
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,567
BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF FALSE 

871
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:30,735
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME.

872
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,237
REALLY FALSE CHARGES.

873
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,204
I KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD 

874
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,640
FALSE CHARGES.

875
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,207
PEOPLE WANT FAME, THEY WANT 

876
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:39,177
MONEY, THEY WANT WHATEVER.

877
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,213
SO, WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT 

878
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:43,248
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY AT 

879
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,816
HOME SITTING AT HOME WATCHING 

880
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,685
TELEVISION WHERE THEY SAY, OH, 

881
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,219
JUDGE KAVANAUGH THIS OR THAT.

882
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,587
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME MANY TIMES.

883
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,523
I'VE HAD MANY FALSE CHARGES.

884
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,424
I HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN 

885
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:55,360
AIRPLANE AND I ATTACKED HER 

886
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,995
WHILE PEOPLE WERE COMING ON THE 

887
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,264
PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER ONE 

888
00:24:59,264 --> 00:24:59,664
BEST SELLER OUT?

889
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,933
IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY STORY.

890
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,768
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM.

891
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,036
SO, WHEN YOU SAY, DOES IT AFFECT

892
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,472
ME IN TERMS OF MY THINKING IN 

893
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,040
RESPECT TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

894
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,643
ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT 

895
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,443
MANY TIMES, AND IF THE NEWS 

896
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:13,077
WOULD HAVE REPORTED THESE FOUR 

897
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:16,348
PEOPLE, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, 

898
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,216
WHEN I HEARD THAT THEY CAUGHT 

899
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,751
THESE FOUR PEOPLE, I SAID, WOW, 

900
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,685
THAT'S A BIG STORY.

901
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,487
AND IT WAS, FOR FOX.

902
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:28,593
OKAY.

903
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,594
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

904
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,029
EARLIER TODAY, AND JUST NOW, YOU

905
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,597
MADE A SIGNIFICANT ALLEGATION 

906
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,298
AGAINST THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.

907
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,633
YOU SUGGESTED THAT THE CHINESE 

908
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:37,535
HAD MEDDLED IN OR ARE 

909
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,436
MEDDLING -- 

910
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,204
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

911
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,338
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

912
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,338
>> WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE OF 

913
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:42,273
THAT, SIR?

914
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:43,742
>> WE HAVE EVIDENCE.

915
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:44,542
WE HAVE EVIDENCE.

916
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,443
IT WILL COME OUT.

917
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,311
I CAN'T TELL YOU NOW, BUT IT 

918
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:49,814
DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE, THAT

919
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,682
I CAN TELL YOU.

920
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,583
THEY'VE ACTUALLY ADMITTED THAT 

921
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,252
THEY'RE GOING AFTER FARMERS.

922
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,587
I THINK MOST OF YOU CAN COVER 

923
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,821
THAT, I LIKE THAT YOU'RE SHAKING

924
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,723
YOUR HEAD, YES, I'M GOING TO ASK

925
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,724
YOU THE NEXT QUESTION BECAUSE OF

926
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,092
THAT, OKAY?

927
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,092
PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE KILLER 

928
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:03,194
OF ALL QUESTIONS.

929
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,362
>> WHY MAKE THE CHARGE NOW IF 

930
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,329
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME FORWARD

931
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:08,133
WITH THE EVIDENCE?

932
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,901
>> CHINA NOW PUT ON $250 BILLION

933
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,270
AND THEY'RE PAYING 25% ON THAT, 

934
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,738
THEY'RE PAYING BILLIONS -- THIS 

935
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,208
HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO CHINA.

936
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,578
AND I LIKE CHINA, AND I LIKE 

937
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,246
PRESIDENT XI A LOT.

938
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,348
I THINK HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

939
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,050
HE MAY NOT BE ANYMORE, BUT I 

940
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,917
THINK HE PROBABLY RESPECTS -- 

941
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,254
FROM WHAT I HEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT

942
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,689
MR. PILLSBURY, THE LEADING 

943
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,091
AUTHORITY ON CHINA, HE WAS ON A 

944
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,325
SHOW, I WON'T MENTION THE NAME 

945
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:36,594
OF THE SHOW, RECENTLY, AND HE 

946
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,663
WAS SAYING THAT CHINA HAS TOTAL 

947
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,865
RESPECT FOR DONALD TRUMP AND FOR

948
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,969
DONALD TRUMP'S VERY, VERY LARGE 

949
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:45,169
BRAIN.

950
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,105
HE SAID DONALD TRUMP -- THEY 

951
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:49,073
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

952
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:49,941
NEVER HAPPENED.

953
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,210
WELL, ONE THING THEY'RE TRYING 

954
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,615
TO DO IS,THEY'RE TRYING TO 

955
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,751
CONVINCE PEOPLE TO GO AGAINST 

956
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,285
DONALD TRUMP.

957
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,586
A NORMAL PERSON WHO HAS NO 

958
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,954
CONCEPT OF WHAT THE HELL HE'S 

959
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,289
DOING WOULD CONTINUE TO LET 

960
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,725
CHINA CONTINUE TO TAKE MONEY OUT

961
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,759
OF OUR COUNTRY.

962
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,495
THEY WERE BUILDING 29 MASSIVE 

963
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,197
BRIDGES, LIKE THE GEORGE 

964
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,030
WASHINGTON BRIDGE, THEY ARE 

965
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,932
BUILDING THINGS THAT WE DON'T 

966
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:15,700
BUILD ANYMORE.

967
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,469
BUT WE'RE STARTING TO BUILD THEM

968
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:17,669
AGAIN.

969
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,471
AND OUR ECONOMY NOW IS HOTTER 

970
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,841
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.

971
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,775
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE 

972
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:24,709
CONFIDENCE LEVELS THIS MORNING 

973
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,010
THAT JUST CAME OUT, FANTASTIC.

974
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,247
AND IN ALL FAIRNESS TO THE FED 

975
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,315
RAISING RATES, THEY'RE RAISING 

976
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:32,650
RATES BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER DONE 

977
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,585
LIKE WE'RE DOING NOW.

978
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,053
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS 

979
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,088
NICE ABOUT THE RATES, THE PEOPLE

980
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,956
THAT WERE HURT THE WORST BY 

981
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:40,725
THESE ZERO INTEREST RATES, YOU 

982
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,060
KNOW, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD 

983
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,762
AN ECONOMY THAT WAS -- IT WAS 

984
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,230
THE WORST COMEBACK SINCE THE 

985
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,232
GREAT DEPRESSION AND YOU'VE ALL 

986
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,168
HEARD THAT, BUT REMEMBER, HE WAS

987
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,402
PLAYING WITH ZERO INTEREST 

988
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:51,669
MONEY.

989
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,239
HE WAS PLAYING WITH FUNNY MONEY.

990
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:54,539
THAT'S EASY.

991
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,240
I'M PLAYING WITH FAIRLY 

992
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,309
EXPENSIVE MONEY.

993
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,410
SO, WHEN HE DOES THAT, THE 

994
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,644
PEOPLE THAT BENEFIT ARE PEOPLE 

995
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:02,514
THAT ACTUALLY, IN THEIR WHOLE 

996
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,550
LIFE, THEY WOULD SAVE 10%, 15%, 

997
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,551
20% OF THEIR SALARY, THOSE 

998
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,652
PEOPLE GOT KILLED, BECAUSE THEY 

999
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,087
PUT THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK, 

1000
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,221
THEY WERE GOING TO LIVE OFF THE 

1001
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:10,989
INTEREST AND THERE WAS NO 

1002
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:11,256
INTEREST.

1003
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,359
NOW THOSE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO

1004
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:14,993
GET INTEREST, AND THOSE ARE THE 

1005
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,196
PEOPLE, FRANKLY, THAT DESERVE 

1006
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,731
TO, YOU KNOW, THEY DID A GREAT 

1007
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:19,897
JOB.

1008
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:21,332
THE PEOPLE THAT DID IT RIGHT, 

1009
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,533
THE PEOPLE THAT DID THE BEST JOB

1010
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,369
GOT HURT THE MOST.

1011
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,138
SO, IN ONE SENSE, I LIKE IT, BUT

1012
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,873
BASICALLY, I'M A LOW INTEREST 

1013
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,440
RATE PERSON.

1014
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,341
YES, MA'AM?

1015
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,811
YES, GO AHEAD.

1016
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,913
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE 

1017
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:35,780
ANOTHER MEETING TOMORROW WITH 

1018
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,881
ROD ROSENSTEIN.

1019
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,148
>> YES. 

1020
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,717
>> ARE YOU PLANNING TO FIRE ROD 

1021
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,017
ROSENSTEIN?

1022
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,386
>> I'M TALKING TO HIM.

1023
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,987
WE'VE HAD A GOOD TALK.

1024
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,089
HE SAID HE NEVER SAID IT.

1025
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:46,324
HE SAID HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IT, 

1026
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,392
HE SAID HE HAS A LOT OF RESPECT 

1027
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:49,160
FOR ME.

1028
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,795
AND HE WAS VERY NICE AND WE'LL 

1029
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:51,763
SEE.

1030
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,999
AND HE'S A MEMBER OF THE TRUMP 

1031
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:55,699
ADMINISTRATION IN THAT SENSE, IN

1032
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,969
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, I WOULD 

1033
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,071
CERTAINLY PREFER NOT DOING THAT.

1034
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,838
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION, THERE 

1035
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,374
WAS NO OBSTRUCTION, UNLESS YOU 

1036
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,342
CALL OBSTRUCTION THE FACT THAT I

1037
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,477
FIGHT BACK, I DO FIGHT BACK, I 

1038
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:07,846
REALLY FIGHT BACK.

1039
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,648
I MEAN, IF YOU CALL THAT 

1040
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,181
OBSTRUCTION, THAT'S FINE.

1041
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:12,884
BUT THERE'S NO OBSTRUCTION, 

1042
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,786
THERE'S NO COLLUSION.

1043
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,853
I'M GOING TO MEET WITH HIM 

1044
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:16,120
TOMORROW.

1045
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,892
I MAY CALL ROD TONIGHT OR 

1046
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,127
TOMORROW AND ASK FOR A LITTLE 

1047
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:24,362
BIT OF A DELAY TO THE MEETING 

1048
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,262
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DO 

1049
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:27,765
ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF

1050
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,366
THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUPREME 

1051
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,668
COURT PICK.

1052
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,769
SO, I DON'T WANT IT COMPETING 

1053
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,071
AND HURTING THE DECISION, ONE 

1054
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,140
WAY OR THE OTHER, DECISION.

1055
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,742
AGAIN, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE 

1056
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,543
HAS TO SAY.

1057
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,577
BUT I DON'T WANT -- SO, I MAY 

1058
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,179
DELAY THAT.

1059
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:41,679
I'M GOING TO SEE.

1060
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,147
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING 

1061
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:44,615
THAT'S GOING TO CONFLICT WITH 

1062
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:44,815
THAT.

1063
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:49,053
BUT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO 

1064
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:49,520
KEEP HIM.

1065
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,556
AND TO LET HIM FINISH UP, YOU 

1066
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,224
KNOW, I CALLED IT A WITCH HUNT.

1067
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,726
AND IT IS A WITCH HUNT.

1068
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,894
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FBI 

1069
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:58,463
STATEMENTS WITH STRZOK AND HIS 

1070
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,398
LOVER, LISA PAGE, IF YOU LOOK AT

1071
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,434
ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON

1072
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,536
IN THE FBI, IF YOU LOOK AT 

1073
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:09,106
McCABE TAKING $700,000 FROM A 

1074
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,743
HILLARY CLINTON PAC, 

1075
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,479
ESSENTIALLY, RUN BY TERRY 

1076
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,147

FRIEND IN THE WORLD, HE GIVES 

1078
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,516
THEM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF 

1079
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,585
DOLLARS AND HE'S IN CHARGE OF 

1080
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,552
HER CAMPAIGN AND HIS WIFE IS 

1081
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,122
GETTING ALL OF THIS MONEY TO 

1082
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,858
RUN, SHE LOST, I MEAN, WHAT'S 

1083
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:28,593
GOING ON?

1084
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,494
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HORRIBLE 

1085
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:33,197
STATEMENTS, LIKE, WAY TO GO, 

1086
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:36,634

1087
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,002
NEWSPAPER, NOW WE'LL GO AND 

1088
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,170
INVESTIGATE THAT GROUP.

1089
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,407
IT'S TERRIBLE.

1090
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,140
WE HAVE CAUGHT PEOPLE DOING 

1091
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,510
THINGS THAT ARE TERRIBLE.

1092
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,213
I WOULD MUCH PREFER KEEPING ROD 

1093
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:50,348
ROSENSTEIN, MUCH PREFER.

1094
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,482
MANY PEOPLE SAY I HAVE THE RIGHT

1095
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,050
TO ABSOLUTELY FIRE HIM, HE SAID 

1096
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,286
HE DID NOT SAY IT, HE SAID HE 

1097
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,421
DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT, AND 

1098
00:30:57,421 --> 00:30:58,656
NOBODY IN THIS ROOM BELIEVES IT,

1099
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,390
BY THE WAY.

1100
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,491
I DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE IN THIS 

1101
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,125
ROOM.

1102
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,227
I WAS WITH MIKE POMPEO BEFORE, 

1103
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:04,729
WE WERE DEALING WITH A VERY HIGH

1104
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,064
LEVEL WITH JAPAN AND I WAS 

1105
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:07,698
SAYING THINGS THAT NOBODY IN THE

1106
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:13,370
ROOM EVEN UNDERSTOOD AND I SAID 

1107
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,507
THEM A LONG TIME AGO AND I WAS 

1108
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:16,874
RIGHT.

1109
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:21,980
HE SAID, THAT'S NOT THE 25th 

1110
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,513
AMENDMENT I'M LOOKING AT.

1111
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,748
>> YOU DON'T THINK ANYONE IN 

1112
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,416
YOUR ADMINISTRATION HAS 

1113
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,452
DISCUSSED USING THE 25th 

1114
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,786
AMENDMENT AGAINST YOU.

1115
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:29,653
>> ENEMIES -- 

1116
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:31,522
>> WITHIN YOUR ADMINISTRATION IN

1117
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,557
YOUR CABINET?

1118
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,925
>> THEY'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.

1119
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,526
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME IN 

1120
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,661
THE ELECTION, THEY KNOW THAT.

1121
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,595
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME.

1122
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,530
THE PEOPLE THAT I'M LOOKING AT 

1123
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,999
ARE TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHTS.

1124
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,735
I DREAM OF RUNNING AGAINST THOSE

1125
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:43,968
PEOPLE.

1126
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:44,835
>> WITHIN YOUR ADMINISTRATION?

1127
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,337
>> THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT ME.

1128
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,405
I'M AGAINST WHAT THEY WANT TO 

1129
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:47,572
DO.

1130
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,676
I'M IN FAVOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT,

1131
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,578
I'M IN FAVOR OF SAFETY AND 

1132
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:55,580
SECURITY AND LOW TAXES, I WANT 

1133
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,782
LOW TAXES.

1134
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,883
I WANT BORDERS.

1135
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,885
WE'RE GETTING ANOTHER 1.6 

1136
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:01,786
BILLION IN BORDERS.

1137
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,654
I WANT BORDERS.

1138
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,222
WE'VE SPENT 3.2 AND WE'RE 

1139
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:09,226
GETTING ANOTHER 1.6 AND THEN 

1140
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:10,661
WE'LL GET THE WHOLE THING AND 

1141
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,229
COMPLETE THE WALL.

1142
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:11,896
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.

1143
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:12,764
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.

1144
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,765
THEY DON'T WANT THE THINGS THAT 

1145
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,298
I HAVE.

1146
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:16,400
NOW, I MUST SAY, I KNOW MANY OF 

1147
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,302
THE DEMOCRATS, THEY'LL SAY 

1148
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:21,039
THINGS AND THEN WINK AT ME.

1149
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,705
AND AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME OLD 

1150
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:23,775
STORY.

1151
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,975
THEY'LL SAY THINGS, THEY DON'T 

1152
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:27,745
MEAN IT.

1153
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,078
IT'S POLITICS.

1154
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:29,280
THE REASON THEY DON'T WANT ME IS

1155
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,782
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO RUN THE 

1156
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,115
SHOW.

1157
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,283
THEY WANT IT.

1158
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:32,950
IT'S POWER, IT'S WHOEVER YOU 

1159
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,317
WANT TO CALL IT.

1160
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:38,122
BUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE HERE IS A 

1161
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,158
DISGRACE, A TOTAL DISGRACE.

1162
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,927
AND WHAT THEY DO -- I KNOW IT'S 

1163
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,195
SORT OF INTERESTING, IN ONE 

1164
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,631
CASE, THEY SAY, HE'S A FASCIST, 

1165
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,732
HE'S TAKING OVER THE GOVERNMENT,

1166
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,233
HE'S THE MOST POWERFUL PRESIDENT

1167
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,735
EVER, HE'S A HORRIBLE HUMAN 

1168
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,603
BEING, HE WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE

1169
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,638
ENTIRE GOVERNMENT AND HE'S GOING

1170
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,573
TO DO IT, WE CAN'T STOP HIM.

1171
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,207
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

1172
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:00,645
THE NEXT WEEK, HE SAID, AH, HE'S

1173
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:00,945
INCOMPETENT.

1174
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,447
IN ONE CASE, I'M TAKING OVER THE

1175
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,416
WORLD AND THE OTHER CASE, HE'S 

1176
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:05,817
INCOMPETENT.

1177
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,684
THEY TRIED THAT FOR A WEEK, THAT

1178
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:06,984
DIDN'T WORK.

1179
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:10,788
LOOK.

1180
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,523
THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE.

1181
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,691
THESE ARE CON ARTISTS.

1182
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,859
AND THE PRESS KNOWS IT, BUT THE 

1183
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:19,063
PRESS DOESN'T WRITE IT.

1184
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:19,497
WOW.

1185
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,731
THAT'S A LOT OF HANDS.

1186
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:23,801
THAT'S A LOT OF -- STEVE, GO 

1187
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:24,001
AHEAD.

1188
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,203
HERE'S A VERY HIGH QUALITY 

1189
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,504
PERSON, THIS MAN, BUT HE'LL 

1190
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,973
PROBABLY HIT ME WITH A BAD ONE.

1191
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,441
GO AHEAD, GIVE IT TO ME.

1192
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,977
>> YOU'RE GETTING LETTERS FROM 

1193
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,846
CHAIRMAN KIM, WHY DO YOU NEED A 

1194
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,980
SECOND SUMMIT WITH THE NORTH 

1195
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,982
KOREAN LEADER SO SOON?

1196
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,650
AND WHAT -- 

1197
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,152
>> BECAUSE EIDEHE'D LIKE IT.

1198
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,488
>> AND WHAT WOULD IT BE FOR?

1199
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,057
>> SO, I'VE RECEIVED TWO LETTERS

1200
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:46,624
FROM CHAIRMAN KIM.

1201
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:47,758
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE LETTERS.

1202
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:51,796
THEY'RE LETTERS THAT ARE 

1203
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,632
MAGNIFICENT IN THE SENSE OF HIS 

1204
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,733
FEELING FOR WANTING TO GET THIS 

1205
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:56,100
DONE.

1206
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,535
I REALLY BELIEVE HE WANTS TO GET

1207
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,202
IT DONE.

1208
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,270
I MAY BE WRONG.

1209
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,473
I HEARD SOMEBODY ON A NERCERTAI 

1210
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,642
NETWORK LAST NIGHT SAY WHY HAS 

1211
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,444
PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVEN SO MUCH TO

1212
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,746
NORTH KOREA, I SAID, WAIT A 

1213
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:08,978
MINUTE.

1214
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:12,014
I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE, PLEASE 

1215
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:13,016
CALL THIS PERSON.

1216
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,518
I GAVE NOTHING, OTHER THAN A 

1217
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:14,685
MET.

1218
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:15,920
WHAT DID I GIVE HIM?

1219
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,889
I DIDN'T DO WHAT OBAMA DID, GIVE

1220
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,623
HIM $1.8 BILLION IN CASH TO GET 

1221
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:21,592
BACK FOUR HOSTAGES.

1222
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,494
I GOT BACK OUR HOSTAGES, I NEVER

1223
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,396
PAID THEM ANYTHING.

1224
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,797
I HAVEN'T PAID THEM 10 CENTS.

1225
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:28,199
BUT HE WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL AND 

1226
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,800
I'D LIKE TO MAUCK A DEAL.

1227
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,536
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY GOOD 

1228
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:31,869
RELATIONSHIP.

1229
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,971
A LOT DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST 

1230
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,005
TIME WE WERE AT THE UNITED 

1231
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:35,239
NATIONS.

1232
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,507
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT ROUGH.

1233
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,676
DON'T FORGET, THAT TIME, THEY 

1234
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,610
SAID, OH, TRUMP IS SAYING THESE 

1235
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,512
HORRIBLE THINGS, HE'S GOING TO 

1236
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:43,514
GET US INTO A WAR.

1237
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,016
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A WAR IF I 

1238
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,518
WASN'T ELECTED, YOU'D BE IN A 

1239
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:47,717
WAR.

1240
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:49,654
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ESSENTIALLY 

1241
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,221
SAID THE SAME THING.

1242
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,056
HE WAS READY TO GO TO WAR.

1243
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,623
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A WAR AND YOU

1244
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:55,359
WOULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS, NOT 

1245
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,561
THOUSANDS, YOU WOULD HAVE LOST 

1246
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,361
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

1247
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,697
SEOUL HAS 30 MILLION PEOPLE 40 

1248
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:03,367
MILES AND 30 MILES FROM THIS 

1249
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:03,834
VERY DANGEROUS BORDER.

1250
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:06,437
IF I WASN'T ELECTED, YOU WOULD 

1251
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:06,804
HAVE HAD A WAR.

1252
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,972
PRESIDENT OBAMA THOUGHT YOU HAD 

1253
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:08,906
TO GO TO WAR.

1254
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:09,773
YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO 

1255
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:12,276
PRESSING THE TRIGGER FOR WAR?

1256
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,477
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

1257
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:14,144
WITH ME, NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT 

1258
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,780
THAT.

1259
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,449
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT.

1260
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:18,882
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 

1261
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,618
RELATIONSHIP.

1262
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,020
HE LIKES ME, I LIKE HIM, WE GET 

1263
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,220
ALONG.

1264
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,321
HE WROTE ME TWO OF THE MOST 

1265
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:27,325
BEAUTIFUL LETTERS.

1266
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,160
WHEN I SHOWED ONE OF THE 

1267
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,762
LETTERS, JUST ONE, TO PRIME 

1268
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,865
MINISTER ABE, HE SAID, THIS IS 

1269
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:36,334
ACTUALLY A GROUNDBREAKING 

1270
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:36,567
LETTER.

1271
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,503
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE -- THIS IS

1272
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:40,871
AN HISTORIC LETTER, AND IT IS.

1273
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,440
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL -- IT'S A 

1274
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,507
BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART.

1275
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:44,775
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE 

1276
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,243
A DEAL.

1277
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,744
WILL WE MAKE A DEAL, STEVE, I 

1278
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,078
DON'T REALLY KNOW, BUT I THINK 

1279
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:49,680
WE'RE GOING TO -- IN THE 

1280
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,015
MEANTIME, AND I'VE SAID IT, I 

1281
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,117
DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU, NO 

1282
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,721
ROCKETS, NO MISSILES, NO NUCLEAR

1283
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:56,921
TESTS.

1284
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,756
YOU KNOW, FOR OVER A YEAR.

1285
00:35:58,756 --> 00:35:59,857
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN.

1286
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,558
BEFORE I GOT HERE, EVERYBODY IN 

1287
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:04,261
THE ROOM THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING 

1288
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,129
TO WAR.

1289
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,664
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED, IT WAS 

1290
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:06,864
FUNNY.

1291
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,666
THEY SAID, HE WAS TERRIBLE, HE 

1292
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:13,270
WAS SO ROUGH WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, 

1293
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,570
KIM JONG-UN.

1294
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,375
HE WAS SO ROUGH, IT'S TERRIBLE.

1295
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:24,649
WELL, I HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH

1296
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:25,650
PRESIDENT PEWUPUTIN.

1297
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,317
AND ON THIS ONE, HE SAID, HE WAS

1298
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,953
TOO SOFT ON PRESIDENT PUTIN.

1299
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,321
WE DISCUSSED EVERYTHING.

1300
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,156
UKRAINE, SYRIA, ISRAEL AND 

1301
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,891
ISRAEL'S PROTECTION, WE HAD A 

1302
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:35,225
GREAT MEETING.

1303
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,961
THEY WANTED ME TO END UP IN A 

1304
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,361
BOXING MATCH.

1305
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,863
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1306
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,664
IF I WAS KILLER TOUGH WITH 

1307
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:42,900
PRESIDENT PUTIN, THEY WOULD HAVE

1308
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,768
SAID, HE WAS TOO TOUGH.

1309
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,436
YOU CAN'T WIN WITH THESE PEOPLE,

1310
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,772
BUT YOU JUST KEEP GOING.

1311
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:51,008
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT 

1312
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,644
SHOULD TAKE NORTH CKOREA TO 

1313
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:53,977
DENUCLEARIZE?

1314
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:55,012
>> STEVE, I DON'T WANT TO GET 

1315
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,181
INTO THE TIME GAME, YOU THOUGH 

1316
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:57,415
WHY?

1317
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,150
I TOLD MIKE POMPEO, I SAID, 

1318
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,718
MIKE, DON'T GET INTO THE TIME 

1319
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:00,918
GAME.

1320
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,821
WE STOPPED THEM, THEY'RE TAKING 

1321
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,790
DOWN PLANTS, THEY'RE TAKING DOWN

1322
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,425
A LOT OF DIFFERENT TESTING 

1323
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,459
AREAS, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE 

1324
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,493
DOWN SOME MORE, YOU'LL BE 

1325
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,694
HEARING ABOUT THAT VERY SOON, I 

1326
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:12,163
DON'T WANT TO GO AHEAD OF 

1327
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:12,797
MYSELF, BUT YOU'LL BE HEARING 

1328
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,565
ABOUT IT SOON.

1329
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,766
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST RIGHT NOW 

1330
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,735
IN TESTING NUCLEAR -- YOU KNOW, 

1331
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,437
WE HAD A CASE JUST ABOUT WHEN I 

1332
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:21,672
WAS COMING INTO OFFICE, YOU'LL 

1333
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,574
REMEMBER IT, WHERE THERE WAS A 

1334
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,110
MASSIVE, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS AN 

1335
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,410
EARTHQUAKE.

1336
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,846
A MOUNTAIN MOVED OVER AN INCH 

1337
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:29,780
AND A HALF.

1338
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,282
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOUNTAINS.

1339
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,217
NORTH KOREA IS VERY MOUNTAINOUS,

1340
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:34,685
BEAUTIFUL LAND.

1341
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,487
THIS MOUNTAIN ACTUALLY SHIFTED.

1342
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,355
IT SHIFTED.

1343
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,722
AND SOMEBODY THOUGHT IT WAS AN 

1344
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:39,990
EARTHQUAKE AND THEY FOUND OUT, 

1345
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,458
NO, THIS WAS NUCLEAR TESTING.

1346
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,493
SHIFTED A MOUNTAIN.

1347
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:47,765
I'M TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS STUFF.

1348
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,098
SERIOUS SIZE.

1349
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,099
WHEN I CAME IN AND CERTAINLY 

1350
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,768
BEFORE I CAME IN, AND EVEN AT 

1351
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,304
THE BEGINNING OF MINE, BECAUSE I

1352
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,506
WAS HAVING RHETORICAL, YOU KNOW,

1353
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,473
CONTESTS EARLY, I GUESS YOU 

1354
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:59,009
COULD CALL IT, WITH CHAIRMAN 

1355
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,644
KIM, WHICH WE BOTH SMILE AT NOW 

1356
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,813
AND WE LAUGH AT, BUT EVERYBODY 

1357
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,781
THOUGHT THAT WAS A HORRIBLE 

1358
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,249
THING.

1359
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:09,954
WE'VE HAD MANY PRESIDENTS, WERE 

1360
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,421
UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING.

1361
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,655
ANYTHING AT ALL WITH NORTH 

1362
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:11,855
KOREA.

1363
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,324
WE NOW HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

1364
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,493
WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

1365
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,462
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL OF THE

1366
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,297
THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING 

1367
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:24,001
ABOUT THE HORROR STORIES, IN MY 

1368
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,903
OPINION, THEY'RE DONE.

1369
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,338
COULD THEY START UP AGAIN, YES.

1370
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,072
I'M A DEAL GUY.

1371
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:28,739
COULD THEY START?

1372
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:29,573
YES.

1373
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,173
COULD BE WE DON'T WORK IT OUT.

1374
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:35,045
I THINK I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

1375
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:36,012
I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE 

1376
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:37,614
BEHIND THE SCENES, WHICH NOBODY 

1377
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:38,782
REALLY KNOWS ABOUT, I DON'T 

1378
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:40,184
BLAME YOU FOR NOT KNOWING ABOUT,

1379
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,618
YOU KNOW, PERSONAL LETTERS, 

1380
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:42,987
PRIVATE LETTERS, BUT SAYING THEY

1381
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,656
WANT TO GET IT DONE.

1382
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,158
WE KNOW MUCH MORE THAN THE MEDIA

1383
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,995
FOR A CHANGE, MUCH MORE, BUT IF 

1384
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,329
YOU SAW WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND 

1385
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,532
THE SCENES, I THINK YOU'D BE 

1386
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,266
VERY IMPRESSED.

1387
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,700
WE WERE A COUNTRY GOING TO WAR.

1388
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,903
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT 

1389
00:38:58,903 --> 00:38:59,970
OBAMA WOULD ADMIT THAT HE SAID 

1390
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,506
IT'S BEEN FAR HIS BIGGEST 

1391
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:02,739
PROBLEM.

1392
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,241
WHEN I SAT WITH HIM PRIOR TO 

1393
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,744
GOING TO OFFICE, GOING INTO 

1394
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,079
OFFICE, HE SAID TO ME THAT'S BY 

1395
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,782
FAR THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, AND HE 

1396
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,517
SAID TO ME THAT HE WAS VERY 

1397
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,456
CLOSE TO GOING INTO WAR.

1398
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,723
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE -- NOT, 

1399
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:21,124
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY, OH, 

1400
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:23,727
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE -- NO, NOT 

1401
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:23,994
THOUSANDS.

1402
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:24,695
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 

1403
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,764
BEEN KILLED, AND THAT COULD HAVE

1404
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,165
LEFT -- YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT TO 

1405
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,233
CHINA, THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A 

1406
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,936
WORLD WAR VERY EASILY.

1407
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,004
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A GREAT 

1408
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:34,271
POSITION.

1409
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,773
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THE TIME 

1410
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,140
GAME.

1411
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,375
I TOLD MIKE POMPEO, DON'T LET 

1412
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:38,842
THEM DO THAT TO YOU.

1413
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:41,111
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING.

1414
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,780
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE GOT 

1415
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,481
BACK, A FEW WEEKS AGO, I THINK 

1416
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:45,949
WE WERE BACK, LIKE, TWO AND A 

1417
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:47,217
HALF MONTHS FROM THE SUMMIT, 

1418
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:49,753
WHICH WAS A GREAT SUCCESS, AND 

1419
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:51,088
PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING, WHAT'S 

1420
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,456
TAKING SO LONG?

1421
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,791
I SAID, OH, I GET IT.

1422
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,059
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE 

1423
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:55,859
MEDIA, I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH 

1424
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,494
THE MEDIA ALL MY LIFE, TOO MUCH,

1425
00:39:57,494 --> 00:39:59,396
TOO MUCH.

1426
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,397
THEY'RE SCREAMING AND I SAW THAT

1427
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:03,567
AND OUR GUYS WERE -- AND NOT 

1428
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,537
MIKE, BUT OUR GUYS WERE BEING, 

1429
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,038
WELL, WE'RE WORKI ING AS FAST -I

1430
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,240
SAID, I GOT ALL THE TIME IN THE 

1431
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,440
WORLD.

1432
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,141
I DON'T HAVE TO RUSH IT.

1433
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:15,212
THERE'S NO, YOU KNOW, CESSATION 

1434
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:15,746
OF SANCTIONS.

1435
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,549
I DIDN'T TAKE ANY SANCTIONS OFF.

1436
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,983
I DID SEE A REPORTER LAST NIGHT,

1437
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:22,253
I GUY A LIKE PERSONALLY A LOT.

1438
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,288
AND HE ASKED A QUESTION TO 

1439
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,722
PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH KOREA, 

1440
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:27,825
HE SAID, WHY DID THE PRESIDENT 

1441
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:28,425
GIVE SO MUCH?

1442
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:29,193
I DIDN'T GIVE ANYTHING.

1443
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,728
I GAVE NOTHING.

1444
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:33,230
WHAT I HAVE I GIVEN?

1445
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,499
OTHER THAN SOME TIME.

1446
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:35,665
YES.

1447
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:37,902
I FLEW TO SINGAPORE, WE HAD A 

1448
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:38,169
MEETING.

1449
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,070
NOW, GIVING WOULD BE IF I TOOK 

1450
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,005
THE SANCTIONS OFF.

1451
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,840
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO -- IF YOU 

1452
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,242
ASK GENERAL MATTIS, FOR A YEAR 

1453
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,111
AND A HALF, I SAID, WHY DON'T WE

1454
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,512
STOP THESE RIDICULOUS, IN MY 

1455
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,681
OPINION, THE MILITARY GAMES, I 

1456
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,783
CALL THEM THE MILITARY GAMES.

1457
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,819
IF I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH THOSE 

1458
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:59,123
GAMES COST, AND FRANKLY, I TOLD 

1459
00:40:59,123 --> 00:40:59,690
SOUTH KOREA, YOU SHOULD BE 

1460
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,257
PAYING FOR THESE GAMES.

1461
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,493
WE PAY FOR THEM.

1462
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,328
THEY SAID, WELL, WE FLY THE 

1463
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,896
PLANES IN FROM A SHORT DISTANCE 

1464
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:06,096
AWAY.

1465
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,365
WHERE IS THAT?

1466
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:08,966
GUAM.

1467
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,899
HOW LONG A TRIP IS THAT?

1468
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,368
SEVEN HOURS.

1469
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,270
WE'RE FLYING MASSIVE BOMBERS.

1470
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,939
I WANTED TO STOP THIS FOR A LONG

1471
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:15,139
TIME.

1472
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,473
I CONSIDER THAT AN ASSET.

1473
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:18,075
BUT WE'RE SAVING, BY THE WAY, 

1474
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,509
JUST FOR THE TAXPAYER, WE'RE 

1475
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:20,243
SAVING A FORTUNE.

1476
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:22,112
AND IF WE NEED THEM, WE CAN 

1477
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,046
START THEM UP IMMEDIATELY.

1478
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,983
IF I THINK WE NEED THEM, I'LL 

1479
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,884
START THEM BEFORE THE GENERALS 

1480
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:27,484
WILL START THEM.

1481
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:28,818
THE FACT IS, THIS REPORTER SAID 

1482
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:31,488
THAT, I SAID WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

1483
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,156
I HAVEN'T GIVEN ANYTHING.

1484
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:35,926
AND WE'RE REALLY ONTO THE CUSP, 

1485
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,261
I THINK WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO

1486
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,428
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE 

1487
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:38,929
VERY IMPORTANT.

1488
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,497
BUT WE'RE NOT PLAYING THE TIME 

1489
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:40,697
GAME.

1490
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,299
IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS, THREE 

1491
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,002
YEARS OR FIVE MONTHS, DOESN'T 

1492
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:45,603
MATTER.

1493
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,104
THERE'S NO NUCLEAR TESTING AND 

1494
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,238
THERE'S NO TESTING OF ROCKETS.

1495
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:51,775
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD.

1496
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:52,042
GO AHEAD.

1497
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:52,275
PLEASE.

1498
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:54,078
THIS IS THE ONE THAT WAS NODDING

1499
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,045
WITH EVERY NICE THING I SAID, 

1500
00:41:55,045 --> 00:42:01,919
SO, WATCH THIS QUESTION.

1501
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:02,620
>> FROM SKY NEWS.

1502
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,154
>> OKAY, GOOD, SKY NEWS.

1503
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,324
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PURCHASE.

1504
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,193
>> NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

1505
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,328
>> I HOPE YOU BENEFITED.

1506
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:15,232
GO AHEAD.

1507
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,967
>> ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED 

1508
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,169
ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT IS BEING 

1509
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,937
SENT TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE 

1510
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:23,473
WATCHING THIS WHEN YOU USE 

1511
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:25,309
LANGUAGE LIKE CON JOB IN 

1512
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,443
RELATION TO ALLEGATIONS OF 

1513
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,010
SEXUAL -- 

1514
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,680
>> I'VE USED MUCH WORSE 

1515
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,547
LANGUAGE.

1516
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:31,582
THAT'S PROBABLY THE NICEST 

1517
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,517
PHRASE I'VE USED.

1518
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,786
CON JOB.

1519
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,322
IT'S A CON JOB BY THE DEMOCRATS.

1520
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,923
THEY KNOW IT.

1521
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:42,125
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT'S

1522
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:42,993
BEING SENT TO WOMEN -- 

1523
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,328
>> THEY DID THE SAME THING WITH 

1524
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,228
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

1525
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,697
THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE 

1526
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,732
THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH 

1527
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:48,965
RUSSIA.

1528
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:50,668
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.

1529
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,769
THINK OF IT.

1530
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,738
I'M IN WISCONSIN, I'M IN 

1531
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,606
MICHIGAN, I SAY, GEE, WE'RE NOT 

1532
00:42:56,606 --> 00:42:58,909
DOING WELL, I WON BOTH THOSE 

1533
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,142
STATES.

1534
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:00,344
WE'RE NOT DOING WELL.

1535
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,213
AH, LET ME CALL THE RUSSIANS TO 

1536
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:03,413
HELP.

1537
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:04,782
DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE 

1538
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:05,082
THAT?

1539
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,616
IT'S A CON JOB.

1540
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:08,985
AND I WATCH THESE GUYS, LITTLE 

1541
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,921
ADAM SCHIFF AND ALL THE GUYS, HE

1542
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,322
TAKES A CALL FROM A RUSSIAN WHO 

1543
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:14,024
TURNED OUT TO BE A FAKER, YOU 

1544
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,026
KNOW, HE WAS A COMEDIAN OR 

1545
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:16,293
SOMETHING.

1546
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,062
THIS IS SO AND SO CALLING.

1547
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,930
WHY IS HE TAKING A CALL FROM A 

1548
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,431
RUSSIAN?

1549
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,431
SENATOR WARNER TOOK A CALL FROM 

1550
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,133
A RUSSIAN.

1551
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,135
HE WAS A COMEDIAN OR SOMETHING.

1552
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,805
BUT HE SAID, WE HAVE PICTURES OF

1553
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,406
PRESIDENT TRUMP -- OH, WHERE CAN

1554
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,941
I GET THEM?

1555
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:31,875
IF WE EVER DID THAT IT WOULD BE 

1556
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,977
LIKE A BIG DEAL.

1557
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:35,079
YEAH, IT'S A CON JOB.

1558
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:36,780
AND IT'S NOT A BAD TERM.

1559
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,215
IT'S NOT A BAD TERM AT ALL.

1560
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,917
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING I CAN 

1561
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,117
SAY.

1562
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,552
I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING

1563
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,787
ABOUT THIS TO ME WITH RESPECT TO

1564
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,124
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BECAUSE IT'S A

1565
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:47,557
HORRIBLE PRECEDENT.

1566
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:49,226
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET OTHER 

1567
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,362
JUDGES AND OTHER SUPREME COURT 

1568
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:52,762
JUDGES, POSSIBLY.

1569
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:55,365
I COULD HAVE A LOT OF SUPREME 

1570
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:59,803
COURT JUDGES, MORE THAN TWO.

1571
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,105
AND WHEN I CALLED UP BRETT 

1572
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,807
KAVANAUGH, SPOKE TO HIM AND HIS 

1573
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,443
FAMILY AND TOLD THEM THAT I 

1574
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,511
CHOSE THEM, THEY WERE SO HAPPY 

1575
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:11,315
AND SO HONORED, IT WAS AS 

1576
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,282
THOUGH, I MEAN, THE BIGGEST 

1577
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,517
THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED, AND 

1578
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,752
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

1579
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:16,787
U.S. SUPREME COURT.

1580
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,888
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION

1581
00:44:18,888 --> 00:44:22,693
WHERE PEOPLE SAY NO THANKS, NO 

1582
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,394
THANKS, YOU KNOW, I -- I SPOKE 

1583
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:27,765
TO SOMEBODY 38 YEARS AGO AND IT 

1584
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,733
MAY NOT BE GOOD.

1585
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,269
WE HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN.

1586
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:32,903
WE WANT THE BEST TALENT IN THE 

1587
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,738
WORLD.

1588
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:35,806
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, THE 

1589
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,975
PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMPLAINED TO 

1590
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:39,809
ME ABOUT IT THE MOST ABOUT 

1591
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:40,944
WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE WOMEN.

1592
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:45,115
WOMEN ARE VERY ANGRY.

1593
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,417
YOU KNOW, I GOT 52% WITH WOMEN, 

1594
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:48,585
EVERYONE SAID THIS COULDN'T 

1595
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,221
HAPPEN, 52%.

1596
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,658
WOMEN ARE SO ANGRY.

1597
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:59,129
AND I FRANKLY THINK THAT -- I 

1598
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,097
THINK THEY LIKE WHAT THE 

1599
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:02,132
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING, BUT I 

1600
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,166
THINK THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO 

1601
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,068
HAVE SEEN IT GO A LOT FASTER.

1602
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:08,772
BUT GIVE THEM THEIR DAY IN 

1603
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,774
COURT, LET SOMEBODY ELSE HAVE A 

1604
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:12,108
DAY IN COURT.

1605
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:13,644
BUT THE ONES THAT I FIND -- I 

1606
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,779
MEAN, I HAVE MEN THAT DON'T LIKE

1607
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,549
IT, BUT I HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE 

1608
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,783
INCENSED AT WHAT'S GOING ON.

1609
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,685
I'VE ALWAYS SAID WOMEN ARE 

1610
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:22,085
SMARTER THAN MEN.

1611
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:23,253
I'VE SAID THAT A LOT.

1612
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:23,787
AND I MEAN IT.

1613
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,890
BUT WOMEN -- WOMEN ARE INCENSED 

1614
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,758
AT WHAT'S GOING ON.

1615
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,227
YES, GO AHEAD.

1616
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,762
GO AHEAD.

1617
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,831
GO AHEAD, IN THE BACK.

1618
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,766
WHO ARE YOU, WHERE ARE YOU 

1619
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,602
FROM -- YEAH, YOU.

1620
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:40,637
GUY LOOKS LIKE HE'S SHOCKED.

1621
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:44,808
THIS IS GOING TO BE NOT GOOD.

1622
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:45,943
GUY LOOKS TOTALLY STUNNED.

1623
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,477
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PICKED BEFORE

1624
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:48,579
FOR A QUESTION?

1625
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,479
>> YES, SIR, BUT NOT FROM THE 

1626
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:51,782
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

1627
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,817
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1628
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:59,723
I WANT TO, SIR, ASK Y-- 

1629
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,759
>> YOU SAID FROM WHERE?

1630
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,728
>> FROM NORTHERN IRAQ, I'M A 

1631
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:04,928
KURD.

1632
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,764
>> GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT PEOPLE.

1633
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,132
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 

1634
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:12,536
>> ARE YOU A KURD?

1635
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:12,969
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 

1636
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:14,204
>> THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE, THEY'RE

1637
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:14,571
GREAT FIGHTERS.

1638
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,639
I LIKE THEM A LOT.

1639
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,239
I LIKE THIS QUESTION.

1640
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,708
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ALWAYS SAY

1641
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,142
YOU SUPPORT YOUR ALLIES.

1642
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:20,110
KURDS RIGHT NOW, AFTER THE 

1643
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,879
DEFEAT OF ISIS, ARE UNDER A LOT 

1644
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:26,483
OF PRESSURE IN SYRIA AND IN IRAQ

1645
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:27,984
BY MANY ADVERSARIES.

1646
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:29,185
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ELEVATE 

1647
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:31,855
THEIR POSITION TO SUPPORT THEM, 

1648
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,156
AFTER THEY HELPED THE UNITED 

1649
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:34,558
STATES TO DEFEAT ISIS?

1650
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,326
>> WELL, WE ARE HELPING THEM A 

1651
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,894
LOT AND WE'VE BEEN VERY FRIENDLY

1652
00:46:37,894 --> 00:46:38,228
WITH THEM.

1653
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,697
AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE FOUGHT 

1654
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,299
SIDE-BY-SIDE AND WE HAVE 

1655
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,566
DEFEATED ISIS, ESSENTIALLY, VERY

1656
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:44,568
SHORT WHILE AGO, IN THE MIDDLE 

1657
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:44,768
EAST.

1658
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,037
AND WE DID IT WITH A LOT OF HELP

1659
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:47,670
FROM THE KURDS.

1660
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,306
AND THEY ARE, THEY'RE GREAT 

1661
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:49,573
FIGHTERS.

1662
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,608
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ARE GREAT 

1663
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,776
FIGHTERS AND SOME PEOPLE AREN'T.

1664
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,144
THE KURDS ARE GREAT FIGHTERS AND

1665
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,779
GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.

1666
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,480
WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT SITUATION 

1667
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,282
EXACTLY RIGHT NOW.

1668
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,549
>> WHAT WILL YOU DO TO SUPPORT 

1669
00:46:59,549 --> 00:46:59,749
THEM?

1670
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:01,150
>> I'M JUST TELLING YOU, WE'RE 

1671
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,919
GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THAT 

1672
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:03,186
SITUATION.

1673
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,654
WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED 

1674
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:05,588
DISCUSSING THAT SITUATION, BUT 

1675
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:07,056
WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT 

1676
00:47:07,056 --> 00:47:08,592
FROM THE KURDS IN DEFEATING 

1677
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:08,792
ISIS.

1678
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:12,129
>> AND ABOUT SYRIA, SIR, IN YOUR

1679
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:12,629
SPEECH -- 

1680
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:16,500
>> AH, YES, GO.

1681
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,068
UH-OH.

1682
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:18,468
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

1683
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,970
>> MR. PRESIDENT, SUSAN LEE FROM

1684
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,671
FOX BUSINESS.

1685
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,773
DID YOU REJECT A ONE-ON-ONE 

1686
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,441
MEETING WITH THE CANADIAN PRIME 

1687
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:24,708
MINISTER?

1688
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,375
>> YEAH, I DID.

1689
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,276
>> WHY?

1690
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,211
>> BECAUSE HIS TARIFFS ARE TOO 

1691
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:29,479
HIGH AND HE DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT

1692
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,781
TO MOVE AND I TOLD HIM FORGET 

1693
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:31,581
ABOUT IT.

1694
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:32,983
AND FRANKLY, WE'RE THINKING 

1695
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,085
ABOUT JUST TAXING CARS COMING IN

1696
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:35,986
FROM CANADA.

1697
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,354
THAT'S THE BIG ONE.

1698
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,256
WE'RE VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE 

1699
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,824
NEGOTIATIONS AND THE NEGOTIATING

1700
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,559
STYLE OF CANADA.

1701
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,127
WE DON'T LIKE THEIR 

1702
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,329
REPRESENTATIVE VERY MUCH.

1703
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,662
THEY'VE TAKEN -- I LOVE CANADA, 

1704
00:47:46,662 --> 00:47:48,798
BY THE WAY, I HAVE EVERYBODY, SO

1705
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:50,801
MANY FRIENDS, BUT THAT HAS 

1706
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,869
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

1707
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,571
I'M RESPPRESENTING THE UNITED 

1708
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,739
STATES.

1709
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,906
MEXICO WAS TOTALLY, I MEAN, THEY

1710
00:47:56,906 --> 00:47:57,541
WERE GREAT.

1711
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,743
BY THE WAY, THE NEW PRESIDENT 

1712
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,044
HAS BEEN GREAT.

1713
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,979
THE DEAL IS DONE.

1714
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,246
NOW IT HAS TO GO THROUGH 

1715
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:04,214
CONGRESS AND A LOT OF THINGS 

1716
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,350
HAVE TO HAPPEN, BUT WE'VE DONE, 

1717
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,784
BOB LIGHTHIZER, WHO IS HERE SOME

1718
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,288
PLACE, WHERE'S BOB?

1719
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:11,922
BOB LIGHTHIZER'S DONE A GREAT 

1720
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,289
JOB OF NEGOTIATING, AS THEY 

1721
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:15,559
HAVE, BUT THE DEAL IS DONE.

1722
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,526
>> MR. PRESIDENT -- 

1723
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,562
>> BUT CANADA HAS TREATED US 

1724
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:20,230
VERY BADLY.

1725
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,331
THEY'VE TREATED OUR FARMERS IN 

1726
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,534
WISCONSIN AND NEW YORK STATE AND

1727
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,737
A LOT OF OTHER STATES VERY 

1728
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,170
BADLY.

1729
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,171
DAIRY PRODUCTS, 300%.

1730
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,540
300%.

1731
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,875
HOW DO YOU SELL A DAIRY PRODUCT 

1732
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,577
AT 300%?

1733
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,278
THE ANSWER IS, YOU DON'T.

1734
00:48:35,278 --> 00:48:37,214
WHAT IT IS IS A BARRIER.

1735
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,348
IT'S BASICALLY, THEY'RE SAYING, 

1736
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,682
WE DON'T HAVE ANY BARRIERS, BY 

1737
00:48:39,682 --> 00:48:41,584
THE WAY, IT'S 300%, YOU DON'T 

1738
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,353
SEND IT IN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T 

1739
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:43,754
COMPETE.

1740
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,422
SO, CANADA HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.

1741
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,357
I MUST BE HONEST, WE'RE NOT 

1742
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,192
GETTING ALONG WITH THEIR 

1743
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:49,492
NEGOTIATORS.

1744
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:50,927
WE THINK THEY HAVE TAKEN 

1745
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,896
ADVANTAGE OF OUR COUNTRY FOR A 

1746
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,231
LONG TIME.

1747
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,799
WE HAD PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T KNOW 

1748
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:56,600
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

1749
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,867
THAT'S WHY WE HAD OVER THE LAST 

1750
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,336
FIVE OR SIX YEARS, IF YOU 

1751
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,271
AVERAGE IT OUT, WE HAD $800 

1752
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,873
BILLION A YEAR IN TRADE LOSSES.

1753
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,007
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1754
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,942
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

1755
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:09,246
>> MR. PRESIDENT, NAFTA, WHAT 

1756
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,981
DOES THAT MEAN FOR NAFTA?

1757
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,916
WILL YOU BE PULLING OUT OF 

1758
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:13,149
NAFTA?

1759
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:14,618
>> I DON'T LIKE NAFTA.

1760
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,585
I NEVER LIKED IT.

1761
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,152
IT'S BEEN VERY BAD FOR THE 

1762
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:17,454
UNITED STATES.

1763
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,756
IT'S BEEN GREAT FOR CANADA, IT'S

1764
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:20,657
BEEN GREAT FOR MEXICO.

1765
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,192
>> WILL YOU PULL OUT -- 

1766
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,428
>> I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE NAME

1767
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,429
NAFTA.

1768
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,064
I REFUSE TO USE IT.

1769
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,498
I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PLANTS 

1770
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,031
AND FACTORIES CLOSE.

1771
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:32,502
I'VE SEEN MILLIONS OF JOBS LOST 

1772
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,770
TO AUTO COMPANIES THAT MOVE.

1773
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,305
MEXICO HAS 25% OF OUR AUTO 

1774
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,140
BUSINESS NOW BECAUSE OF NAFTA.

1775
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,242
UNDER OUR DEAL, NOT GOING TO 

1776
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,710
HAPPEN ANYMORE, HATE TO TELL 

1777
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,345
YOU, IT'S NOT.

1778
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:43,079
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP COMPANIES.

1779
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,147
I TOLD THE MEXICANS, WE HAVE TO 

1780
00:49:45,147 --> 00:49:46,049
KEEP COMPANIES.

1781
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,116
BUT THEY'RE GETTING A LOT ALSO, 

1782
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:48,585
THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF GOOD 

1783
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,487
THINGS.

1784
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,087
MEXICO MADE A VERY GOOD DEAL.

1785
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:52,722
BUT WITH CANADA, IT'S VERY 

1786
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:53,223
TOUGH.

1787
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,324
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS, IF WE MADE 

1788
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,159
A DEAL WITH CANADA, WHICH IS, 

1789
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,560
YOU KNOW, A GOOD CHANCE STILL, 

1790
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,763
BUT I'M NOT MAKING ANYTHING NEAR

1791
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:00,464
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

1792
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,666
>> ARE YOU GOING TO NOTIFY 

1793
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,966
CONGRESS OF PULLING OUT OF 

1794
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:04,234
NAFTA?

1795
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,902
>> WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO CALL 

1796
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,304
IT THE USMC, LIKE, THE UNITED 

1797
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:10,207
STATES MARINE CORPS, WHICH I 

1798
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,474
LOVE, GENERAL KELLY LIKES IT 

1799
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:12,209
EVEN MORE.

1800
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,177
WHERE IS GENERAL KELLY, HE LIKES

1801
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:18,615
THAT, USMC, WHICH WOULD BE U.S.,

1802
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,318
MEXICO, CANADA, BUT IT WILL 

1803
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,320
PROBABLY BE, POSSIBLY BE JUST 

1804
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,154
USM, IT WILL BE UNITED STATES 

1805
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,089
AND MEXICO.

1806
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,023
CANADA WILL COME ALONG.

1807
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,791
IF CANADA DOESN'T MAKE A DEAL 

1808
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,126
WITH US, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 

1809
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:31,027
MUCH BETTER DEAL.

1810
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,162
WE'RE GOING TO TAX THE CARS THAT

1811
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,331
COME IN, WE WILL PUT BILLIONS 

1812
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,600
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR

1813
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,301
TREASURY AND, FRANKLY, WE'LL BE 

1814
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,769
VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE IT'S 

1815
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:41,571
ACTUALLY MORE MONEY THAN YOU CAN

1816
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,672
MAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WITH

1817
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:45,075
MAKING A DEAL.

1818
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,176
GOOD JOB, TOO.

1819
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:46,877
YOU DO A VERY GOOD JOB.

1820
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,579
REALLY.

1821
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,417
YES, PLEASE.

1822
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:55,986
GO AHEAD.

1823
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:59,789
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 

1824
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:00,323
TIME, MR. PRESIDENT.

1825
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,926
TWO QUICKLY QUESTIONS.

1826
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,460
WHAT WILL BE THE USA RELATIONS 

1827
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,395
WITH THE KURDS?

1828
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,063
>> OH, I THOUGHT I JUST ANSWERED

1829
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:07,263
THAT.

1830
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:08,665
>> POST-ISIS.

1831
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,966
>> OKAY, WE'RE TRYING TO GET 

1832
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,001
ALONG VERY WELL.

1833
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,769
WE DO GET ALONG GREAT WITH THE 

1834
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:13,203
KURDS.

1835
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,738
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM A LOT.

1836
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,406
DON'T FORGET, THAT'S THEIR 

1837
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:16,673
TERRITORY.

1838
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,674
I WANT TO HELP THEM.

1839
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,643
GO AHEAD, WHAT'S NEXT.

1840
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:20,176
THEY FOUGHT WITH US.

1841
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:22,479
THEY DIED WITH US.

1842
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,880
WE LOST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 

1843
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,751
KURDS DIED FIGHTING ISIS.

1844
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,585
THEY DIED FOR US AND WITH US AND

1845
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,754
FOR THEMSELVES.

1846
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,591
THEY DIED FOR THEMSELVES.

1847
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,124
BUT THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE.

1848
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:37,127
AND WE HAVE NOT -- WE DON'T 

1849
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:37,394
FORGET.

1850
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,429
I DON'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENS SOME

1851
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,031
DAY LATER, BUT I CAN TELL YOU 

1852
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,599
THAT I DON'T FORGET.

1853
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,099
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.

1854
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,000
OKAY.

1855
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,035
YES, MA'AM, PLEASE.

1856
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,037
>> ABOUT IRAN, MR. PRESIDENT, 

1857
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:50,006
ABOUT IRAN WHAT IS YOUR CLEAR 

1858
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,975
PLAN TO STOP IRANIAN INFLUENCE 

1859
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,811
IN IRAQ, IN SYRIA AND 

1860
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:55,178
ESPECIALLY -- 

1861
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:56,813
>> WELL, I THINK YOU'VE SEEN, I 

1862
00:51:56,813 --> 00:52:00,717
MUST TELL YOU, I DON'T MIND YOUR

1863
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:00,984
QUESTION.

1864
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:01,317
>> THANK YOU.

1865
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:02,018
>> I THINK THERE'S BEEN NO 

1866
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:04,921
GREATER CHANGE, OTHER THAN MAYBE

1867
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:05,956
CHINA, BECAUSE CHINA, 

1868
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,823
UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR MARKETS 

1869
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:11,661
HAVE DROPPED, WOULD YOU SAY, 30%

1870
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,295
IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS, RIGHT?

1871
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,664
I THINK I WATCHED YOU RECENTLY 

1872
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:15,365
WHEN YOU SAID THAT.

1873
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,500
A LOT.

1874
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,536
THERE'S BEEN NO, OTHER THAN 

1875
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,439
MAYBE THAT, BUT EVEN THAT, 

1876
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:24,073
BECAUSE CHINA IS A VERY SPECIAL 

1877
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:26,042
PLACE.

1878
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,777
AND IRAN IS A VERY SPECIAL 

1879
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:28,010
PLACE.

1880
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,680
BUT I THINK THERE'S BEEN NO 

1881
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,249
COUNTRY THAT'S CHANGED SO MUCH 

1882
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,752
AS IRAN.

1883
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:42,125
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE I 

1884
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,427
TOOK OFF THE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 

1885
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,062
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, AS THEY 

1886
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,764
CALLED IT, ONE OF THE DUMBEST 

1887
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,767
DEALS EVER MADE, AS AN EXAMPLE, 

1888
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,135
WHY DIDN'T THEY TAKE CARE OF 

1889
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,836
YEMEN IN THE DEAL, WHY DIDN'T 

1890
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:55,405
THEY TAKE CARE OF SYRIA IN THE 

1891
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:55,605
DEAL?

1892
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,440
YOU KNOW WHAT THE REASON WAS?

1893
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,209
IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED.

1894
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,944
WE'RE GIVING $150 BILLION.

1895
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,114
WE PAID $1.8 BILLION IN CASH, IN

1896
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,316
CASH, THE ROOM WOULD BE FILLED 

1897
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:10,086
UP WITH $100 BUL BILLS.

1898
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,122
WE GAVE $1.8 BILLION IN CASH.

1899
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,823
WHY DIDN'T WE TAKE CARE OF 

1900
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:14,023
YEMEN?

1901
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:15,725
WHY DIDN'T WE TAKE CARE OF SYRIA

1902
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,127
AND OTHER -- AND HE SAID, 

1903
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:20,163
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED.

1904
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,097
WELL, YOU JUST GAVE THEM ALL 

1905
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:21,998
YOUR CARDS.

1906
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,800
YOU GAVE THEM $150 BILLION.

1907
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,703
AND NOW YEMEN IS A MESS, BUT 

1908
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,137
IT'S GETTING BETTER.

1909
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:30,340
AND SYRIA'S A MESS.

1910
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,374
AND I WAS RESPONSIBLE, AND I 

1911
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,743
HOPE IT STAYS THAT WAY, WHEN I 

1912
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,779
PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA A FEW 

1913
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,848
WEEKS AGO ABOUT IDLIB PROVINCE.

1914
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,984
I SAID, DON'T DO IT.

1915
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,118
I'LL TELL YOU, IT HAPPENED WHERE

1916
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:46,356
I WAS AT A MEETING WITH A LOT OF

1917
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,590
SUPPORTERS AND A WOMAN STOOD UP 

1918
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,292
AND SHE SAID, THERE'S A PROVINCE

1919
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,128
IN SYRIA WITH 3 MILLION PEOPLE.

1920
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,529
RIGHT NOW, THE IRANIANS, THE 

1921
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:55,531
RUSSIANS AND THE SYRIANS 

1922
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:57,367
SURROUNDING THEIR PROVINCE, AND 

1923
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,534
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL MY SISTER 

1924
00:53:58,534 --> 00:53:59,702
AND THEY'RE GOING TO KILL 

1925
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:00,336
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN ORDER TO 

1926
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:05,709
GET RID OF 25,000 OR 35,000 

1927
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,310
TERRORISTS OR ENEMIES OF THEIRS,

1928
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,380
BUT I THINK WE CAN CALL THEM 

1929
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:10,680
TERRORISTS.

1930
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,815
AND I SAID, THAT'S NOT GOING TO 

1931
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:12,782
HAPPEN.

1932
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:16,653
I DIDN'T HEAR OF IDLIB PROVINCE.

1933
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:20,723
AND I CAME BACK TO NEW YORK AND 

1934
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:23,093
I PICKED UP THE FAILING "NEW 

1935
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,128
YORK TIMES," I HATE TO ADMIT IT 

1936
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,364
WAS "THE NEW YORK TIMES," BUT IT

1937
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,667
WAS THE FAILING "NEW YORK 

1938
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:30,900
TIMES."

1939
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,270
THERE WAS A STORY, AND THERE WAS

1940
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,372
THE SAME STORY.

1941
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:37,740
WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT WITH 3 

1942
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,775
MILLION PEOPLE?

1943
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,944
AND IT SAID THEY WERE BEING 

1944
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,711
SURROUNDED AND THINK WERE GOING 

1945
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,179
IN STARTING LITERALLY THE NEXT 

1946
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,714
DAY THEY WERE GOING TO DROP 

1947
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:45,848
BOMBS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND 

1948
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:47,650
PERHAPS KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 

1949
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:48,718
IN ORDER TO GET 35,000 

1950
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,220
TERRORISTS.

1951
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,422
AND I PUT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

1952
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,824
AND ELSEWHERE, I GAVE MIKE 

1953
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:58,027
POMPEO, JOHN BOLTON, EVERYBODY 

1954
00:54:58,027 --> 00:54:59,763
THESE ORDERS, DON'T LET IT 

1955
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:00,063
HAPPEN.

1956
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,800
I SAID, DON'T LET IT HAPPEN.

1957
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,669
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE 

1958
00:55:06,669 --> 00:55:08,938
SELECTIVE, THEY CAN'T BE, YOU 

1959
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,506
KNOW, GO IN AND -- THEY'VE GOT 

1960
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:12,308
TO DO WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO 

1961
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,611
WITH TERRORISTS, ASSUME THEY'RE 

1962
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:15,779
TERRORISTS, BUT DON'T KILL 

1963
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,548
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

1964
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:19,215
AND IT STOPPED.

1965
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,383
YOU SAW THAT.

1966
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,016
NOBODY'S GOING TO GIVE ME 

1967
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:22,852
CREDIT, BUT THAT'S OKAY.

1968
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:23,753
THAT'S OKAY.

1969
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,488
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE KNOW.

1970
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,857
I HAVE HAD MORE SYRIANS THANK ME

1971
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,258
FOR THAT -- THIS WAS ABOUT FOUR 

1972
00:55:29,258 --> 00:55:31,327
WEEKS AGO, I PUT THAT OUT.

1973
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,129
I SAID, THEY'RE SURROUNDING A 

1974
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,030
CITY OF 3 MILLION PEOPLE, 

1975
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,765
THEY'RE GOING TO START BOMBING 

1976
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:40,937
THE CITY, DON'T LET IT HAPPEN.

1977
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,172
AND I MEANT IT, TOO, I MEANT IT.

1978
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:45,642
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

1979
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,578
SAVED, AND I GAVE TODAY GREAT 

1980
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:49,645
CREDIT TO IRAN, I DON'T KNOW IF 

1981
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:54,717
YOU HEARD THAT, I GAVE GREAT 

1982
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:57,720
CREDIT TO IRAN, TO RUSSIA AND TO

1983
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,888
SYRIA FOR NOT DOING IT.

1984
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,690
NOW, I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE 

1985
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,626
SURGICAL, MEANING GO IN AND DO, 

1986
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,193
IT'S LENGTHY AND EVERYTHING 

1987
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:04,393
ELSE.

1988
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:08,865
AND THEY POSSIBLY HAVE TO DO IT.

1989
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,933
BUT I THINK MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 

1990
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,167
WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

1991
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:11,801
AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 

1992
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:12,001
SHAME.

1993
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,504
AND HOPEFULLY -- AND I HAVE TO 

1994
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,372
TELL YOU, TURKEY HAS BEEN A BIG 

1995
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:16,873
HELP.

1996
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,941
TURKEY HAS BEEN GREAT.

1997
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,508
TURKEY HAS HELPED US VERY MUCH 

1998
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:23,746
WITH THAT WHOLE SITUATION.

1999
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:25,515
YES, YES.

2000
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:26,583
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

2001
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:27,650
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

2002
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,985
>> TOUCHING BACK ON IRAN, OF 

2003
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,553
COURSE, THIS WEEK, YOU PUT OUT A

2004
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,021
CALL TO ACTION TO OTHER 

2005
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,423
COUNTRIES TO RALLY WITH AMERICA 

2006
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,758
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IRAN.

2007
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:36,492
ROUHANI STILL CALLING FOR THE 

2008
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:38,761
U.S. TO COME BACK INTO THE OLD 

2009
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:38,961
DEAL.

2010
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:40,129
BUT AFTER MEETING WITH WORLD 

2011
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:41,698
LEADERS THIS WEEK, DID YOU MAKE 

2012
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,099
ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS A POTENTIAL

2013
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,033
NEW DEAL?

2014
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,068
>> DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WORLD 

2015
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:47,270
LEADERS THINK ON IRAN.

2016
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,404
IRAN'S GOING TO COME BACK TO ME 

2017
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,774
AND THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A GOOD

2018
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:51,974
DEAL.

2019
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:52,207
I THINK.

2020
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:52,474
MAYBE NOT.

2021
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:54,777
DEALS, YOU NEVER KNOW.

2022
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:56,746
BUT THEY'RE SUFFERING GREATLY.

2023
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,380
THEY'RE HAVING RIOTS IN EVERY 

2024
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,516
CITY.

2025
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,284
FAR GREATER THAN THEY WERE 

2026
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,753
DURING THE GREEN PERIOD WITH 

2027
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,120
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

2028
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,289
FAR GREATER, WHEN PRESIDENT 

2029
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,489
OBAMA STUCK UP FOR GOVERNMENT, 

2030
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:09,459
NOT THE PEOPLE.

2031
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,826
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HAD A 

2032
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:12,228
MUCH DIFFERENT IRAN HAD HE NOT 

2033
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,162
DOPE THAT.

2034
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:14,364
BUT I'M STICKING WITH THE 

2035
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:14,597
PEOPLE.

2036
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,398
I AM WITH THE PEOPLE OF IRAN.

2037
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:18,301
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

2038
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:22,539
THEY HAVE RAMPANT INFLATION.

2039
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,040
THEIR MONEY IS WORTHLESS.

2040
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,974
EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG.

2041
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:25,575
YOU CAN'T BUY BREAD.

2042
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,309
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

2043
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,511
IT'S A DISASTER.

2044
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,612
AT SOME POINT, I THINK THEY'RE 

2045
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,047
GOING TO WANT TO COME BACK AND 

2046
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:31,748
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, HEY, CAN 

2047
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,183
WE DO SOMETHING?

2048
00:57:34,183 --> 00:57:35,451
AND VERY SIMPLE, I JUST DON'T 

2049
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,719
WANT THEM TO HAVE NUCLEAR 

2050
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,887
WEAPONS, THAT'S ALL.

2051
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:38,888
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

2052
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,122
I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 

2053
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:40,756
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

2054
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:42,225
I WANT THEM TO HAVE A GREAT 

2055
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:42,458
ECONOMY.

2056
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,893
I WANT THEM TO SELL SO MUCH OIL 

2057
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,662
SO THAT THE OIL PRICES -- I'M 

2058
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,863
NOT HAPPY WITH OPEC.

2059
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:47,930
I TOLD THEM, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH 

2060
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,933
OPEC.

2061
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,134
WE TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE 

2062
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,669
PEOPLE, WE DEFEND THEM, THEY 

2063
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,669
WOULDN'T THERE FOR TWO WEEKS IF 

2064
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:55,571
IT WASN'T FOR ME AND THE UNITED 

2065
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:57,039
STATES AND OUR MUCH STRONGER 

2066
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:00,009
ARMED FORCES THAN IT WAS, 

2067
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,579
BECAUSE OUR ARMED FORCES WAS 

2068
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,714
DEPLETED, WE HAD OLD EQUIPMENT.

2069
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,051
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY, 

2070
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,852
716 BILLION, WE HAVE THE MOST 

2071
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,421
INCREDIBLE NEW JETS AND 

2072
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:11,721
EVERYTHING.

2073
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:12,155
WE NEED IT.

2074
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,690
NOT THAT I WANT TO SPEND IT, 

2075
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,758
THOUGH IT IS JOBS, IT'S ALL MADE

2076
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,294
IN THE UNITED STATES.

2077
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:19,928
BUT IRAN HAS TO COME BACK AND 

2078
00:58:19,928 --> 00:58:22,799
THEY HAVE TO TALK.

2079
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,001
AND I'M NOT DOING THIS FROM 

2080
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,669
STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS.

2081
00:58:27,669 --> 00:58:28,370
I'M JUST SAYING AT SOME POINT 

2082
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,439
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME 

2083
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:29,639
BACK.

2084
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,140
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON, 

2085
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:31,774
COMPANIES ARE LEAVING LEFT AND 

2086
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:35,345
RIGHT.

2087
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,447
MERCEDES B-BENZ JUST LEFT.

2088
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:38,381
THEY'RE ALL LEAVES.

2089
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,016
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IN IRAN.

2090
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,117
THEY HAVE A CHOICE.

2091
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,585
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH IRAN OR 

2092
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,053
DO THEY WANT TO BE WITH US?

2093
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,689
AND WE PICKED UP $10 TRILLION 

2094
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,025
SINCE MY ELECTION.

2095
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,359
WE WERE BEING CAUGHT BY CHINA, 

2096
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:51,728
NOW IT'S GOING THE OTHER WAY.

2097
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:52,562
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

2098
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:53,829
PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS 

2099
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:54,998
SITUATION WITH CHINA.

2100
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,532
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS BEEN FOR 20 

2101
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:57,667
YEARS, OH, CHINA'S SO GREAT, 

2102
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,136
CHINA'S SO GREAT.

2103
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:01,571
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 

2104
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:01,804
ANYMORE.

2105
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,773
I LOVE CHINA.

2106
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:04,240
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT.

2107
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,241
BUT YOU DON'T HEAR THAT SO MUCH 

2108
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:05,474
ANYMORE.

2109
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:06,909
YOU KNOW WHO IS GREAT NOW?

2110
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:07,677
WE'RE GREAT NOW.

2111
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:08,277
OKAY, HOW ABOUT JUST A COUPLE 

2112
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:11,447
MORE?

2113
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,481
I COULD BE -- I COULD BE DOING 

2114
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,951
THIS ALL DAY LONG.

2115
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,086
I COULD BE DOING THIS ALL DAY 

2116
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:17,286
LONG.

2117
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:19,121
SHOULD WE CONTINUE FOR A LITTLE 

2118
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:20,456
WHILE, IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME?

2119
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,760
COUPLE MORE?

2120
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,527
I DON'T CARE.

2121
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,895
"NEW YORK TIMES."

2122
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,764
COME ON.

2123
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:28,031
STAND UP.

2124
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,565
GO AHEAD.

2125
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:31,367
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT "THE 

2126
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,101
TIMES" IS FAILING.

2127
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,102
YOU ARE FAR FROM FAILING.

2128
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,437
>> YOU WERE POINTING TO ME, SO 

2129
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:35,772
YOU MEANT ME.

2130
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,675
>> "THE TIMES," VERY 

2131
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:39,275
INTERESTING, I THINK THEY'RE 

2132
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:42,679
GOING TO ENDORSE ME.

2133
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,348
I THINK THAT ABC, WELL, FOX, I 

2134
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:47,517
LIKE FOX, I REALLY DO.

2135
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,219
I THINK ABC, CBS, NBC, THE 

2136
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,153
TIMES, THEY'RE ALL GOING TO 

2137
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:52,622
ENDORSE ME, BECAUSE IF THEY 

2138
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:53,589
DON'T, THEY'RE GOING OUT OF 

2139
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,856
BUSINESS.

2140
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:54,590
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T 

2141
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:55,324
HAVE ME?

2142
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:56,859
GO AHEAD WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO 

2143
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:57,025
SAY?

2144
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:58,161
>> I KNOW YOU WERE POINTING TO 

2145
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,130
ME, BUT I POINT FOR PBS NEWS 

2146
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:01,363
OUTLET.

2147
01:00:01,363 --> 01:00:02,131
>> I KNOW THAT.

2148
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,733
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, YESTERDAY,

2149
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,135
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR 

2150
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:06,769
ADMINISTRATION'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS

2151
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,237
AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND A LOT 

2152
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,471
OF THE LEADERS LAUGHED.

2153
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:10,173
WHY DO YOU THINK -- 

2154
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:11,407
>> WELL, THAT'S FAKE NEWS.

2155
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,641
>> WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE 

2156
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:12,841
LIKE?

2157
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,844
>> IT WAS FAKE NEWS AND IT WAS 

2158
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:15,611
COVERED THAT WAY.

2159
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:18,715
SO, I SAID THAT SINCE MY 

2160
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:19,949
ELECTION, OUR ECONOMY HAS BECOME

2161
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,351
THE HOTTEST IN THE WORLD.

2162
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:25,188
TAX REDUCTIONS, REGULATIONS, 

2163
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,190
CONFIDENCE LEVELS ARE THE 

2164
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,691
HIGHEST IN 18 YEARS, REALLY SOON

2165
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,193
TO BE HISTORIC.

2166
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,228
UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE LOWEST IN 

2167
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,696
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, YOU 

2168
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,197
LOOK AT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU 

2169
01:00:35,197 --> 01:00:36,799
LOOK AT ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU 

2170
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,702
LOOK AT WOMEN 65 YEARS.

2171
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:40,936
THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE 

2172
01:00:40,936 --> 01:00:41,804
AMONG THE BEST WE'VE EVER HAD 

2173
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:45,074
EVER.

2174
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:46,609
THE NUMBERS OF NEW COMPANIES 

2175
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,610
POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY, WHICH 

2176
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,980
NOBODY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE.

2177
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,949
AND I SAID THIS AND I WAS IN 

2178
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,385
FRONT OF A LARGE GROUP OF HIGHLY

2179
01:00:56,385 --> 01:00:57,219
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE, MOST OF 

2180
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:59,689
WHOM ARE FROM EITHER OTHER 

2181
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,624
COUNTRIES OR THE UNITED NATIONS,

2182
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,559
PEOPLE THAT AREN'T BIG INTO 

2183
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,962
CLAPPING, APPLAUDING, SMILING.

2184
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:08,698
AND I HEARD A LITTLE RUSTLE, AS 

2185
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:11,667
I SAID, OUR COUNTRY IS NOW 

2186
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:12,267
STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.

2187
01:01:12,267 --> 01:01:12,869
IT'S TRUE.

2188
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:16,305
I HEARD A LITTLE RUSTLE, I SAID,

2189
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,740
IT'S TRUE.

2190
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,674
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WOULD BE 

2191
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,476
THAT KIND -- THEY WEREN'T 

2192
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:21,144
LAUGHING AT ME.

2193
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,245
THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH ME.

2194
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:22,945
WE HAD FUN.

2195
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,181
THAT WAS NOT LAUGHING AT ME.

2196
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,316
SO, THE FAKE NEWS SAID, PEOPLE 

2197
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:30,853
LAUGHED AT PRESIDENT TRUMP.

2198
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,353
THEY DIDN'T LAUGH AT ME.

2199
01:01:31,353 --> 01:01:32,755
PEOPLE HAD A GOOD TIME WITH ME.

2200
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,023
WE WERE DOING IT TOGETHER.

2201
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,326
WE HAD A GOOD TIME.

2202
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:37,893
THEY RESPECT WHAT I'VE DONE.

2203
01:01:37,893 --> 01:01:40,896
THE UNITED STATES IS RESPECTED 

2204
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:41,264
AGAIN.

2205
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,566
UNITED STATES WAS NOT RESPECTED.

2206
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:44,800
EVERYBODY WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE 

2207
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,203
OF US, FROM JOBS AND TAKING OUR 

2208
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,572
COMPANIES AND NOT PAYING THE 

2209
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,040
PRICE, TO SO MANY OTHER THINGS, 

2210
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,974
EVEN MILITARY PROTECTION.

2211
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,210
I TOLD A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES 

2212
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:54,944
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, I SAID, 

2213
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,280
LISTEN.

2214
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,048
YOU'RE A VERY RICH COUNTRY.

2215
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,850
WE PROTECT YOU.

2216
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,753
WITHOUT OUR PROTECTION, YOU 

2217
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:04,921
WOULD HAVE REAL PROBLEMS.

2218
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,055
>> I WANT TO -- 

2219
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,958
>> I SAID, YOU SHOULD REIMBURSE 

2220
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,092
US FOR THIS PROTECTION.

2221
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:11,994
WHY ARE WE PROTECTING YOU?

2222
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,429
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY 

2223
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:13,629
SAID?

2224
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:16,365
AFTER ABOUT TWO MINUTES OF 

2225
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,634
TALKING, THEY AGREED WITH ME.

2226
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:21,037
AND YOU CAN ASK THIS GROUP OF 

2227
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:21,604
VERY TALENTED PEOPLE.

2228
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:22,738
THEY AGREED WITH ME.

2229
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:25,741
BUT THEY SAID, ONE OF THEM SAID,

2230
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:27,409
BUT MR. PRESIDENT, NOBODY EVER 

2231
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:29,779
ASKED US, THEY NEVER ASKED US 

2232
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:30,713
FOR THAT.

2233
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,114
NOBODY'S EVER SAID, YOU SHOULD 

2234
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:32,280
PAY.

2235
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,917
THESE ARE REALLY WEALTHY 

2236
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:35,184
COUNTRIES.

2237
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,320
I MEAN, I'LL BE HONEST, I JUST 

2238
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,188
ASKED JAPAN, I SAID, WE'RE 

2239
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,456
DEFENDING YOU, YOU'RE A VERY 

2240
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,457
WEALTHY COUNTRY.

2241
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:42,892
YOU'RE SENDING US MILLIONS OF 

2242
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,794
CARS, WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS TRADE

2243
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:45,995
DEFICIT WITH YOU.

2244
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,264
AND WE'RE DEFENDING YOU AND 

2245
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,098
WE'RE SUBSIDIZING YOUR MILITARY 

2246
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:52,768
WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

2247
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:53,836
I SAID IT TO SOUTH KOREA.

2248
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:57,073
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS IN SOUTH

2249
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:57,540
KOREA.

2250
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,441
THEY'RE VERY WEALTHY.

2251
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,374
THESE ARE GREAT COUNTRIES.

2252
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:00,843
THESE ARE VERY WEALTHY 

2253
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:01,177
COUNTRIES.

2254
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,012
I SAID, WHY AREN'T YOU 

2255
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,614
REIMBURSING US FOR OUR COSTS?

2256
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,648
AND YOU THOUGH WHAT, THEY LOOK 

2257
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:06,815
AT ME AND THEY CAN'T ANSWER, 

2258
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:08,618
BECAUSE THERE'S NO ANSWER.

2259
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,919
IF THEY'RE A POOR COUNTRY AND 

2260
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,253
THEY NEEDED PROTECTION AND 

2261
01:03:11,253 --> 01:03:13,122
PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DIE, I'M 

2262
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,324
ALL FOR PROTECTING THEM, I DON'T

2263
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:16,125
WANT 10 CENTS.

2264
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,861
BUT WHEN WEALTHY COUNTRIES THAT 

2265
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,996
HAVE MASSIVE TRADE SURPLUSES 

2266
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:23,832
WITH US, MASSIVE, AND THEN ON 

2267
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:25,501
TOP OF THAT, WE'RE PAYING FOR 

2268
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,769
THEIR MILITARY OR WE'RE PAYING 

2269
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,838
FOR A LOT OF THEIR MILITARY, 

2270
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:29,472
THAT DOESN'T WORK.

2271
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,539
HOW ABOUT TWO MORE AND -- 

2272
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:32,275
>> MR. PRESIDENT, REALLY 

2273
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,242
QUICKLY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID

2274
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,778
YOU FEEL A KINSHIP, YOU SAID YOU

2275
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,246
FEEL A KINSHIP WITH BRETT 

2276
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,448
KAVANAUGH AND -- MR. PRESIDENT, 

2277
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:40,249
REALLY QUICKLY, YOU SAID YOU 

2278
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,385
FELT A KINSHIP WITH BRETT 

2279
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:42,885
KAVANAUGH, YOUR FALSE 

2280
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,887
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU FEEL LIKE 

2281
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:45,787
WERE MADE AGAINST YOU MAKE YOU 

2282
01:03:45,787 --> 01:03:47,156
FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO 

2283
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:47,823
BELIEVE THIS WOMEN.

2284
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:48,958
WHAT -- 

2285
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:49,892
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

2286
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:50,927
FAKE NEWS.

2287
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,862
>> PLEASE EXPLAIN THEN WHAT YOU 

2288
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:53,362
WERE TALKING ABOUT.

2289
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,697
>> BY THE WAY, YOU THINK YOU DO 

2290
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:55,498
A VERY GOOD JOB.

2291
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,499
BUT I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

2292
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,766
I DO WATCH YOU AND YOU THINK YOU

2293
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:58,701
DO A VERY GOOD JOB.

2294
01:03:58,701 --> 01:03:59,969
>> COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU 

2295
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:00,436
MEANT?

2296
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:00,870
>> EXACTLY.

2297
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,605
I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING HER.

2298
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:05,574
I DO WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAYS.

2299
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:07,076
AND MAYBE SHE'LL SAY, I COULD BE

2300
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,978
CONVINCED OF ANYTHING.

2301
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:10,846
MAYBE SHE'LL SAY SOMETHING.

2302
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:11,980
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE TO 

2303
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,417
TELL YOU, HE'S ONE OF THE 

2304
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:19,755
HIGHEST QUALITY MAN BEINGS.

2305
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,424
HE'S A TREMENDOUS MAN.

2306
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,825
HE'S A GREAT INTELLECT.

2307
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,360
HE WAS NUMBER ONE AT YALE -- 

2308
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,161
>> SO YOU DON'T FEEL A KINSHIP 

2309
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:26,729
WITH HIM?

2310
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:27,896
>> HE WAS A GREAT STUDENT IN 

2311
01:04:27,896 --> 01:04:28,397
LAW.

2312
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,066
HE WAS, YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD HIS

2313
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,001
NAME, I DIDN'T KNOW HIM, DIDN'T 

2314
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,102
KNOW HIM, UNTIL THIS WHOLE 

2315
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:33,302
THING.

2316
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,170
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

2317
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,737
BUT I HEARD HIS NAME FOR TEN 

2318
01:04:35,737 --> 01:04:36,138
YEARS.

2319
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,773
AND YOU KNOW HOW I HEARD HIS 

2320
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:37,973
NAME?

2321
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:39,775
EVERYBODY WAS SAYING, HE SHOULD 

2322
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:40,509
BE ON THE SUPREME COURT.

2323
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,611
I SAID, WHO IS HE?

2324
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:45,047
HIS NAME IS BRETT KAVANAUGH.

2325
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,715
AND HE SHOULD BE, HE'S THE MOST 

2326
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:49,084
BRILLIANT PERSON, HE'S THE MOST 

2327
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:50,152
BRILLIANT LAWYER -- THEY WERE 

2328
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:53,589
TALKING ABOUT HIM ON THE SUPREME

2329
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:54,857
COURT TEN YEARS AGO.

2330
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,692
WITH ALL OF THAT, I WANT TO HEAR

2331
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:57,526
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAID.

2332
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,861
>> YOU SAID THAT YOU FEEL LIKE 

2333
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,562
THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS FALSE 

2334
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:01,964
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST YOU AND THAT

2335
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:02,264
BECAUSE -- 

2336
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:03,332
>> I'VE HAD MANY FALSE -- 

2337
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,967
>> YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S 

2338
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:05,300
GOING THROUGH.

2339
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,869
>> I'VE HAD MANY FALSE 

2340
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,471
STATEMENTS AGAINST ME AND IF THE

2341
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:09,572
PRESS WOULD HAVE REPORTED, I 

2342
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,706
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY.

2343
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,175
JOHN ROBERTS WOULD TELL YOU, YOU

2344
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:14,443
COVERED THE STORY WHERE THE 

2345
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,712
WOMEN WERE PAID TO SAY BAD 

2346
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:17,913
THINGS ABOUT ME.

2347
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:18,948
SEAN HANNITY COVERED IT.

2348
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,050
I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN -- I SAW 

2349
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,952
THAT ON SEAN HANNITY, I ACTUALLY

2350
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:23,786
CALLED HIM.

2351
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:24,453
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

2352
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,122
I DON'T SPEAK TO HIM VERY MUCH.

2353
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:26,655
BUT I RESPECT HIM.

2354
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:28,090
I CALLED HIM.

2355
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,825
I SAID, THIS IS THE BIGGEST 

2356
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,761
STORY, THIS IS A BIG, BIG STORY.

2357
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,862
HE AGREED WITH ME.

2358
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,697
THE NEXT DAY, I PICKED UP THE 

2359
01:05:35,697 --> 01:05:37,466
PAPERS, THERE WASN'T ONE WORD 

2360
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:37,800
ABOUT IT.

2361
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,269
I WATCHED ABC NEWS, JON, I 

2362
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:44,873
WATCHED NBC, I WATCHED CBS, I 

2363
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,076
DIDN'T WATCH CNN, BUT NEXT TIME 

2364
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:47,409
I WILL.

2365
01:05:47,409 --> 01:05:48,710
>> ARE YOU OKAY WITH -- 

2366
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,779
>> I WATCHED EVERYTHING.

2367
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:51,781
THERE WASN'T ONE STORY OTHER 

2368
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,916
THAN FOX.

2369
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,351
AND IT'S A BIG STORY.

2370
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:56,852
IT'S A SHAME.

2371
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,187
OKAY, THANK YOU.

2372
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:58,554
THANK YOU.

2373
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,322
>> IS IT OKAY IF I GIVE IT TO 

2374
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:02,091
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" MR. 

2375
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:02,358
PRESIDENT?

2376
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,692
>> THAT'S ENOUGH.

2377
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:04,427
GOOD JOB.

2378
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,861
>> MR. PRESIDENT, COULD I ASK A 

2379
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:06,795
QUESTION SINCE I AM FROM "THE 

2380
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:09,298
NEW YORK TIMES" BEFORE THIS 

2381
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:09,732
GENTLEMAN?

2382
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,067
>> SINCE YOU'RE WHERE?

2383
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,334
>> I'M ACTUALLY FROM "THE NEW 

2384
01:06:12,334 --> 01:06:13,836
YORK TIMES."

2385
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,304
SHE IS MY FORMER COLLEAGUE, WE 

2386
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:15,771
MISS HER.

2387
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:16,672
BUT I WAS -- 

2388
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,507
>> I DON'T BLAME YOU.

2389
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,309
I'LL LET YOU DO IT AFTER HE 

2390
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:20,509
DOES.

2391
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:21,043
IS THAT OKAY?

2392
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,479
>> THAT'S PERFECTLY WELL.

2393
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,913
>> IN HONOR OF A PAPER I ONCE 

2394
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:25,113
LOVED.

2395
01:06:25,113 --> 01:06:26,782
THANK YOU.

2396
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:27,282
GO AHEAD.

2397
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:29,918
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I'M WITH TRU 

2398
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:30,453
NEWS.

2399
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:34,957
TODAY, YOU MET WITH BIBI 

2400
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:35,557
NETANYAHU AND YOU BROUGHT UP 

2401
01:06:35,557 --> 01:06:36,525
THAT YOU SUPPORTED A TWO-STATE 

2402
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:38,127
SOLUTION FOR THE 

2403
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:38,727
PALESTINIAN/ISRAELI CRISIS 

2404
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:38,927
THERE.

2405
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:41,630
>> I DO.

2406
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,099
>> CAN YOU GIVE US ANYMORE 

2407
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:43,766
PREVIEW, WHAT THIS GREAT DEAL --

2408
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:44,967
>> I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE A DEAL 

2409
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,471
WITH THE ISRAELIS AND THE 

2410
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:48,804
PALESTINIANS.

2411
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:49,405
MY WHOLE LIFE, I WAS TOLD, 

2412
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,674
THAT'S THE TOUGHEST DEAL.

2413
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,175
I DISAGREE, I THINK HEALTH CARE 

2414
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,543
IS PROBABLY TOUGHER, THAT'S THE 

2415
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:54,743
TRUTH.

2416
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:55,277
BUT IT IS TOUGH.

2417
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,679
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 

2418
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:56,946
THAT, TOO.

2419
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,782
THAT'S GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE 

2420
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:00,116
OF.

2421
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,518
WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF A LOT OF IT.

2422
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:06,055
ALL MY LIFE, I'VE HEARD THE DEAL

2423
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,423
BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS AND THE

2424
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,291
ISRAELIS IS THE TOUGHEST DEAL.

2425
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:09,891
EVERYTHING TOUGH ABOUT THAT.

2426
01:07:09,891 --> 01:07:11,160
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 

2427
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:11,393
DEAL.

2428
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:12,795
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A 

2429
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:12,995
DEAL.

2430
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:16,031
SO, AT ONE OF OUR MANY MEETINGS 

2431
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:18,501
TODAY, I WAS WITH BIBI 

2432
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,736
NETANYAHU, A MAN WHO I HAVE A 

2433
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:23,105
LOT OF RESPECT FOR.

2434
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,040
MAN THAT'S BEEN VERY NICE TO ME,

2435
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,375
HAPPY THAT I DID THE WHOLE THING

2436
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,777
WITH JERUSALEM.

2437
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:30,379
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IN FOUR 

2438
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,947
MONTHS FOR LESS THAN $500,000.

2439
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:34,750
AND THE BUDGET WAS OVER A 

2440
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,484
BILLION DOLLARS, RIGHT?

2441
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:35,885
>> YES.

2442
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,953
>> SO, WE SAVED A BILLION 

2443
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:38,186
DOLLARS.

2444
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:38,821
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

2445
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:39,688
AND IT'S OPEN.

2446
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,858
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

2447
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:43,225
JERUSALEM STONE.

2448
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,093
SOME OF MY FAVORITE STUFF.

2449
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:46,195
I WILL TELL YOU, THE QUESTION, 

2450
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,864
SOMEBODY SAID TODAY, WELL, THIS 

2451
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:49,898
IS FIRST NEWS CONFERENCE IN A 

2452
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,166
LONG TIME, I SAID, WHAT DO YOU 

2453
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:51,634
MEAN?

2454
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:52,501
I DID FIVE TODAY.

2455
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,203
EVERY TIME I SIT, I TAKE A LOT 

2456
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:56,505
OF QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE THAT 

2457
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,672
ARE SCREAMING LIKE MANIACS IN 

2458
01:07:57,672 --> 01:07:59,975
THE BACK OF THE ROOM, MEANING 

2459
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,043
REPORTERS, AND ONE OF THE 

2460
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,378
REPORTERS, I WON'T SAY THAT IT 

2461
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,812
WAS JOHN ROBERTS THAT SAID THAT,

2462
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,948
BUT ONE OF THE -- IT WAS, BUT 

2463
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:06,682
THAT'S OKAY.

2464
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:07,883
DON'T FEEL GUILTY, JOHN.

2465
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:09,017
BUT ONE OF THE REPORTERS THAT 

2466
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:12,821
WAS SCREAMING ASKED ABOUT THE 

2467
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:13,822
ONE STATE/TWO STATE.

2468
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:15,757
AND I SAID, I THINK THE 

2469
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:18,827
TWO-STATE WILL HAPPEN, I THINK 

2470
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:20,496
IT'S IN ONE WAY MORE DIFFICULT, 

2471
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,465
BECAUSE IT'S A REAL ESTATE DEAL,

2472
01:08:23,465 --> 01:08:24,533
BECAUSE YOU NEED MEETS AND 

2473
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,536
BOUNDS AND YOU NEED LOTS OF 

2474
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:27,803
CARVEOUTS.

2475
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,138
IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE TOUGHER 

2476
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:29,470
DEAL.

2477
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,872
BUT ANOTHER WAY IT WORKS BETTER,

2478
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:31,907
BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE 

2479
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:34,410
GOVERNING THEMSELVES AND, SO, 

2480
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,178
THEY ASKED ME ABOUT THAT, I 

2481
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,214
SAID, WELL, I THINK THE 

2482
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:39,214
TWO-STATE WILL HAPPEN, I THINK 

2483
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:39,948
WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN THE 

2484
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:41,649
TWO-STATE ROAD.

2485
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:43,419
AND I'M GLAD I GOT IT OUT.

2486
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,354
AND JARED, WHO IS SO INVOLVED, 

2487
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,023
HE LOVES ISRAEL, HE LOVES 

2488
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:48,256
ISRAEL.

2489
01:08:48,256 --> 01:08:49,791
BUT HE'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY 

2490
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,527
FAIR WITH THE PALESTINIANS.

2491
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:52,661
HE UNDERSTANDS IT TAKES TWO 

2492
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:53,929
PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY.

2493
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:55,698
TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO BE 

2494
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:55,898
HAPPY.

2495
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:56,799
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE HAPPY.

2496
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,233
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO TOUGH, 

2497
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:00,801
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH 

2498
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:03,138
HATRED AND ANGER FOR SO MANY 

2499
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:04,106
YEARS, THAT'S WHAT PROBABLY THE 

2500
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,674
NUMBER ONE INGREDIENT OF 

2501
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,142
TOUGHNESS IS, BUT THEY ASKED ME,

2502
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:08,711
I SAID, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

2503
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:09,545
A TWO-STATE.

2504
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:11,247
AND YOU THOUGH WHAT I DID TODAY?

2505
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,881
BY SAYING THAT, I PUT IT OUT 

2506
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:13,081
THERE.

2507
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:15,082
AND IF YOU ASK MOST OF THE 

2508
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:16,652
PEOPLE IN ISRAEL, THEY AGREE 

2509
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,453
WITH THAT.

2510
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:18,886
BUT NOBODY WANTED TO SAY IT.

2511
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:20,622
IT'S A BIG THING TO PUT IT OUT.

2512
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:22,890
IT'S A VERY BIG THING TO PUT IT 

2513
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:23,459
OUT.

2514
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,560
NOW, BOTTOM LINE, IF THE 

2515
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,497
ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS 

2516
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,165
WANT ONE STATE, THAT'S OKAY WITH

2517
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,767
ME, IF THEY WANT TWO STATES, 

2518
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,502
THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.

2519
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,872
I'M HAPPY IF THEY'RE HAPPY.

2520
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,874
I'M A FACILITATOR, I WANT TO SEE

2521
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:42,278
IF I CAN GET A DEAL DONE SO THAT

2522
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:42,912
PEOPLE DON'T GET KILLED ANYMORE.

2523
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,046
WHEN WE HAD, IN SAUDI ARABIA, WE

2524
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:45,581
HAD ONE OF THE GREAT CONFERENCES

2525
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,783
IN HISTORY, MANY OF YOU WERE 

2526
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:48,417
THERE, PROBABLY ALL OF YOU WERE 

2527
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,654
THERE.

2528
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:52,287
ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TWO 

2529
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:52,488
DAYS.

2530
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:54,290
THAT AND CHINA.

2531
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,824
TWO OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE 

2532
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,260
EVENTS I'VE EVER SEEN, SAW -- 

2533
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,029
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE 

2534
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:00,195
IT.

2535
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:03,766
AND WE HAD, I BELIEVE, 58 MUSLIM

2536
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:09,338
COUNTRIES, THE LEADERS, THE 

2537
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:15,277
KINGS, THE ABSOLUTE LEADERS, 

2538
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:16,612
THERE WAS PHONE IN SECOND PLACE.

2539
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,782
THEY WERE THE LEADERS OF ALL.

2540
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,116
UNBEKNOWNST TO EVERYBODY ELSE, 

2541
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,685
IT WASN'T A SETUP, THEY'D COME 

2542
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,053
UP TO ME AND SAID, SIR, YOU 

2543
01:10:25,053 --> 01:10:28,156
CAN'T HAVE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE 

2544
01:10:28,156 --> 01:10:33,128
EAST WITHOUT PEACE BETWEEN THE 

2545
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,295
ISRAELIS AND THE MRUNPALESTINIA.

2546
01:10:34,295 --> 01:10:35,230
I SAID, WHY DOES THAT MATTER SO 

2547
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:35,497
MUCH?

2548
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:37,666
THEY SAID, IT JUST IS IMPOSSIBLE

2549
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,335
TO MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

2550
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,036
UNLESS YOU HAVE IT BETWEEN THE 

2551
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:41,303
ISRAELIS.

2552
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,871
SO, I HEARD THAT FROM ONE, THE 

2553
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:46,709
KING OF SAUDI ARABIA, WHO IS A 

2554
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,243
GREAT GUY.

2555
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:49,544
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE CAME UP 

2556
01:10:49,544 --> 01:10:51,946
AND HE WASN'T TOLD, OH, GO UP 

2557
01:10:51,946 --> 01:10:53,749
AND SAY IT.

2558
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,316
I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING 

2559
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:54,516
FROM.

2560
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:58,053
AND I MUST HAVE HAD 12 LEADERS 

2561
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,022
SAY IT AND THEY JUST SAID IT.

2562
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,990
AND I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT 

2563
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:05,327
PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE 

2564
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:05,927
PALESTINIANSES FOR THE MIDDLE 

2565
01:11:05,927 --> 01:11:06,895
EAST IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING.

2566
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:07,529
AND WE'RE TRYING VERY HARD TO 

2567
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,164
GET IT.

2568
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,999
I THINK PROBABLY TWO-STATE IS 

2569
01:11:10,999 --> 01:11:12,935
MORE LIKELY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

2570
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,503
IF THEY DO A SINGLE, IF THEY DO 

2571
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,438
A DOUBLE, I'M OKAY WITH IT IF 

2572
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,339
THEY'RE BOTH HAPPY.

2573
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:19,641
IF THEY'RE BOTH HAPPY, I'M OKAY 

2574
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:20,309
WITH EITHER.

2575
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,977
I THINK THE TWO-STATE IS MORE 

2576
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:22,277
LIKELY.

2577
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:24,279
OKAY, HOW ABOUT -- 

2578
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:28,083
>> "NEW YORK TIMES"?

2579
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:28,684
>> AH -- 

2580
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:29,184
>> OKAY.

2581
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,354
>> I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A BAD 

2582
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:38,026
STORY "ININ "THE NEW YORK TIMS".

2583
01:11:38,026 --> 01:11:40,362
>> WE'RE KIND OF THRIVING THESE 

2584
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:40,662
DAYS.

2585
01:11:40,662 --> 01:11:42,564
>> SAY THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP.

2586
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:45,534
>> I THINK I'LL STOP SHORT OF 

2587
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:45,934
THAT.

2588
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,369
>> ALL MY LIFE, I'VE HAD SOME ON

2589
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:49,705
THE FRONT PAGE OF "THE NEW YORK 

2590
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,106
TIMES" AND NOW I THINK I AVERAGE

2591
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,674
THREE, FOUR A DAY, RIGHT?

2592
01:11:52,674 --> 01:11:53,642
AND OF THE THREE OF FOUR, 

2593
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,576
THEY'RE ALL NEGATIVE, NO MATTER 

2594
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,311
WHAT I DO, THEY'RE NEGATIVE.

2595
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:58,847
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S OKAY.

2596
01:11:58,847 --> 01:11:59,581
I STILL LOVE THE PAPER.

2597
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,316
>> I WANTED TO COME BACK TO 

2598
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:02,384
CHINA, BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU 

2599
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:03,618
ANNOUNCED TODAY WAS REALLY 

2600
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:03,918
IMPORTANT.

2601
01:12:03,918 --> 01:12:04,419
>> I AGREE.

2602
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:05,520
>> YOU TALK ABOUT THIS 

2603
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,457
FRIENDSHIP YOU HAVE WITH XI 

2604
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:09,424
JINPING, AND YET, ESSENTIALLY, 

2605
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:11,860
WHAT YOU DID TODAY IS ACCUSED 

2606
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,495
HIS GOVERNMENT OF INTERFERING IN

2607
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,364
OUR INTERNAL AFFAIRS -- 

2608
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:16,432
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

2609
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,299
>> SUBVERTING OUR DEMOCRATIC 

2610
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:18,834
PROCESS AND DOING IT TO HURT 

2611
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,235
YOU, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- 

2612
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,403
>> DOING IT TO HELP THEM.

2613
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:22,971
>> AND YOUR BACKERS.

2614
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:24,039
>> DOING IT TO HELP THEM.

2615
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,141
>> SO, HOW CAN A GUY THAT DOES 

2616
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,109
THAT BE YOUR FRIEND?

2617
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:28,377
>> WELL, I THINK THAT WE ARE 

2618
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,812
ABLE TO -- AND MAYBE HE'S NOT 

2619
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:30,145
ANYMORE.

2620
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:31,713
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THINK

2621
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:33,048
WE HAD A VERY GOOD FRIENDSHIP.

2622
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,184
I THINK WE HAD A VERY GOOD 

2623
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:35,784
RELATIONSHIP.

2624
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:36,317
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

2625
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:38,620
THEY ARE DOING STUDIES ON DONALD

2626
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,589
TRUMP, THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE 

2627
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:43,292
IT ALL OUT, BECAUSE THIS HAS 

2628
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:43,825
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

2629
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:45,627
THINK OF IT.

2630
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,196
YOU'VE COVERED VERY WELL, YOU'VE

2631
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,130
NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN.

2632
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,865
THEY'RE HAVING BIG PROBLEMS.

2633
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,066
I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE 

2634
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,801
PROBLEMS, BUT THEY HAVE TO MAKE 

2635
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:53,335
A FAIR DEAL.

2636
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,869
JUST LIKE CANADA'S GOT TO MAKE A

2637
01:12:54,869 --> 01:12:55,136
FAIR DEAL.

2638
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:59,007
I BELIEVE THAT HE AND I HAVE A 

2639
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,075
VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY TOGETHER.

2640
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:04,412
AND I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THAT 

2641
01:13:04,412 --> 01:13:06,381
WITH LEADERS, AND THERE ARE SOME

2642
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:07,649
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A CHEMISTRY

2643
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,017
WITH THEM, AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE,

2644
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:12,454
I'LL HAVE POMPEO, NIKKI, BOLTON,

2645
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:16,124
JARED, I CAN GO, OUR GENERAL, IF

2646
01:13:16,124 --> 01:13:18,961
THEY CAN'T DO IT, I'LL HAVE 

2647
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,629
SARAH HUCKABEE DO IT, RIGHT?

2648
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,331
FOR THE MOST PART, I'M VERY GOOD

2649
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,299
WITH PRIME MINISTER ABE, VERY 

2650
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:25,501
GOOD WITH PRESIDENT MOON.

2651
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:26,768
BY THE WAY, WHAT PRESIDENT MOON 

2652
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:28,437
SAID LAST NIGHT, I KNOW YOU 

2653
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:31,540
WON'T REPORT IT, BUT HE WAS 

2654
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,975
INTERVIEWED LAST NIGHT AND HE 

2655
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,077
ASKED HIM ABOUT ME.

2656
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,078
I CAN'T SAY BECAUSE YOU WOULD 

2657
01:13:37,078 --> 01:13:39,547
SAY I'M TOO BRAGGADOCIOUS, BUT 

2658
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:40,181
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ME LAST NIGHT

2659
01:13:40,181 --> 01:13:45,921
WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE THING.

2660
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,256
COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT 

2661
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,590
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND IT NEVER 

2662
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,558
WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT PRESIDENT 

2663
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:50,058
TRUMP.

2664
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:50,926
AND NOBODY ELSE COULD DO IT.

2665
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,261
I MEAN, YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK, BUT 

2666
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,364
I WILL TELL YOU, CHINA IS VERY 

2667
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:59,768
SPECIAL.

2668
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:00,101
VERY SPECIAL.

2669
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:01,069
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.

2670
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:02,371
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COUNTRY.

2671
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:03,672
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS 

2672
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,005
UNBELIEVABLE.

2673
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:06,975
AND IT ALL STARTED WITH THE WTO.

2674
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,677
THERE WAS A DEFECTIVE DEAL AND 

2675
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,846
IT ALL STARTED.

2676
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,215
WITHOUT THE WTO, CHINA IS NOT 

2677
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,749
CHINA THE WAY IT IS TODAY, AND 

2678
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:17,085
IT STARTED AS BY OUR PEOPLE THAT

2679
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:17,886
ARE STANDING RIGHT IN THIS 

2680
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,888
POSITION THAT ARE IN THE OVAL 

2681
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:21,123
OFFICE, ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING 

2682
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,858
IT, ALLOWED THEM TO GET AWAY 

2683
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:23,425
WITH MURDER.

2684
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:24,960
ALLOWED A LOT OF COUNTRIES TO 

2685
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,461
GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

2686
01:14:26,461 --> 01:14:28,730
I THINK WE STILL PROBABLY HAVE A

2687
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:29,998
VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP, BUT YOU 

2688
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,467
KNOW WHAT, IN HONOR OF YOU, I 

2689
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:33,735
WILL, TOMORROW, MAKE A CALL TO 

2690
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,271
HIM, SAY, HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

2691
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:36,538
OKAY?

2692
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:39,374
CAN I -- YOU DON'T MIND PAYING 

2693
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,475
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A MONTH.

2694
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:43,512
>> I JUST HAVE TWO SMALL 

2695
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:43,779
FOLLOWUPS.

2696
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:44,846
ONE IS, HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE 

2697
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:45,880
THE LEVEL OF INTERFERENCE YOU 

2698
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,684
SAY TODAY FROM THE CHINESE TO 

2699
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,252
WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID IN 2016.

2700
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:53,288
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S DIFFERENT.

2701
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:55,824
IF YOU LOOK AT "THE DES MOINES 

2702
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,225
REGISTER," THEY HAVE ADS THAT 

2703
01:14:57,225 --> 01:14:59,528
ARE MADE TO LOOK LIKE 

2704
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:00,228
EDITORIALS, SAYING ABOUT, OH, 

2705
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:04,066
YOU HAVE TO STOP TRUMP, YOU HAVE

2706
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,834
TO STOP HIM.

2707
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:06,768
MY FARMERS ARE SOED GOO.

2708
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:07,703
THEY ARE PATRIOTS.

2709
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,672
YOU KNOW, ON A NETWORK THAT 

2710
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:11,306
DOESN'T LIKE ME VERY MUCH, WHICH

2711
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,142
IS MOST OF THEM, BUT A NETWORK 

2712
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,343
THAT DIDN'T -- DOESN'T REALLY 

2713
01:15:15,343 --> 01:15:17,713
TREATMENT ME VERY GOOD, THEY 

2714
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:20,349
INTERVIEWED FARMERS AND THEY GOT

2715
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,950
HURT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, ALL OF A

2716
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,151
SUDDEN CHINA STOPS BY.

2717
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,786
BY THE WAY, THEY'VE STARTED 

2718
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:25,920
BUYING AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF 

2719
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,222
YOU NOTICED.

2720
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:30,292
SOYBEANS ARE GOING UP, THINGS 

2721
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:30,892
ARE GOING UP, WE'VE HAD VERY 

2722
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:34,396
LITTLE HURT FROM WHAT I'VE DONE,

2723
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:35,931
IN FACT, THE MARKETS HAVE GONE 

2724
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:36,565
UP AND THE FARMERS ARE GOING TO 

2725
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:37,232
DO GREAT, BUT ULTIMATELY, BUT 

2726
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:38,567
THEY HAD FARMERS.

2727
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:39,501
AND THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING.

2728
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,069
I LOVE THEM.

2729
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,271
AND THEY VOTED FOR ME AND THEY 

2730
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:43,639
LOVE ME.

2731
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,940
AND THEY SAID, WE DON'T CARE IF 

2732
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,543
WE GET HURT, HE'S DOING THE 

2733
01:15:48,543 --> 01:15:49,211
RIGHT THING.

2734
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,613
AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE, 

2735
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:52,614
IT'S A COMPLEX GAME.

2736
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,182
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 

2737
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,250
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, THEY DON'T 

2738
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,519
KNOW HOW TO DEFINE TARIFF, IT IS

2739
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:58,620
REALLY DIFFERENT THAN A TAX, 

2740
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,555
THOUGH IT'S GETTING CLOSE.

2741
01:16:00,555 --> 01:16:01,255
BUT THEY KNOW THAT FOR THE FIRST

2742
01:16:01,255 --> 01:16:06,761
TIME IN MANY, MANY YEARS, THEY 

2743
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:07,895
HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT'S FIGHTING

2744
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:08,730
FOR THEM.

2745
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,033
THAT'S NOT LETTING THEIR JOBS BE

2746
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,034
TAKEN TO OTHER COUNTRIES.

2747
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:15,771
THAT'S NOT ALLOWING THE KIND OF 

2748
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:19,007
ABUSE THAT -- I MEAN, WHEN YOU 

2749
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,942
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AS AN 

2750
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:22,210
EXAMPLE WITH NAFTA, AND FOR 

2751
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,511
YEARS, BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER 

2752
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:25,146
CHANGED, NAFTA WAS A DEFECTIVE 

2753
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:26,715
DEAL THE DAY IT WAS SIGNED.

2754
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:27,516
YOU KNOW WHY?

2755
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:30,085
BECAUSE THEY HAD A VAT TEXT OF 

2756
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,553
17% AND NOBODY FROM THIS COUNTRY

2757
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:32,721
KNEW THAT, AND BY THE TIME THEY 

2758
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,589
FOUND OUT, WHICH WAS ABOUT A 

2759
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:36,357
WEEK LATER, NOBODY WENT AND 

2760
01:16:36,357 --> 01:16:36,958
CHANGED IT.

2761
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,393
SO, YOU WENT MANY YEARS, AND 

2762
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:39,761
THEY NEVER CHANGED IT.

2763
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,762
THERE WAS A VAT TAX THAT MEXICO 

2764
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,864
GOT.

2765
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:47,769
SO, WE WERE 17 OR 16 POINTS 

2766
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,970
BEHIND BEFORE WE EVEN STARTED.

2767
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,505
NAFTA WAS A HORRIBLE THING.

2768
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,574
SO, THE FARMERS AND, BY THE WAY,

2769
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,576
THE STEELWORKERS, YOU KNOW, I 

2770
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:58,413
STOPPED THE DUMPING, THE DUMPING

2771
01:16:58,413 --> 01:16:58,746
WAS HORRIBLE.

2772
01:16:58,746 --> 01:17:00,048
AND NOW IF THEY WANT TO DUMP, 

2773
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:01,149
THAT'S OKAY, BUT THEY'VE GOT TO 

2774
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,185
PAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

2775
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:03,752
25% ON EVERYTHING THEY DUMP.

2776
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,187
THAT'S OKAY.

2777
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,888
BUT AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE, STEEL 

2778
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,423
IS DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL.

2779
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:11,659
BUT THE FARMERS SAY, THIS MAN'S 

2780
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:13,294
FIGHTING FOR US, NO PRESIDENT 

2781
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:14,763
HAS EVER FOUGHT FOR US BEFORE.

2782
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,231
AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO STUDY 

2783
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:17,766
WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE 15 

2784
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:18,300
YEARS.

2785
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,034
THE FARMERS HAVE BEEN DECIMATED 

2786
01:17:20,034 --> 01:17:23,805
OVER A 15-YEAR PERIOD.

2787
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,640
THEY'VE BEEN DECIMATED.

2788
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,775
FARMERS ARE GOING TO COME OUT 

2789
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:26,975
GREAT.

2790
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,242
THEY'RE GREAT, GREAT PATRIOTS.

2791
01:17:28,242 --> 01:17:29,143
I THINK WE SHOULD FINISH WITH 

2792
01:17:29,143 --> 01:17:30,011
THAT ONE, IS THAT OKAY?

2793
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:33,682
OKAY.

2794
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:34,115
GO AHEAD, LET'S GO.

2795
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:35,751
FAST.

2796
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:36,518
>> SURE.

2797
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,019
>> ALWAYS LIKE TO FINISH WITH A 

2798
01:17:38,019 --> 01:17:39,187
GOOD ONE.

2799
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,655
ELTON JOHN SAID, WHEN YOU HIT 

2800
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:43,058
THAT LAST TUNE AND IT'S GOOD, 

2801
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,926
DON'T GO BACK.

2802
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:45,260
>> WELL -- 

2803
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,362
>> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN, THEY 

2804
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,430
DO -- THEY HIT THE LAST TUNE, 

2805
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,465
EVERYONE GOES CRAZY, THEY GO 

2806
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,000
BACK FOR AN ENCORE, RIGHT?

2807
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,436
AND THEY DON'T HIT IT.

2808
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,638
AND THEY LEAVE, EVERYONE LEAVES,

2809
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,173
THAT WASN'T A VERY GOOD 

2810
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:58,473
CONFERENCE.

2811
01:17:58,473 --> 01:17:59,641
>> WELL, ONE FINAL QUESTION -- 

2812
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:01,076
>> DON'T MAKE ME WRONG.

2813
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,811
>> AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S HEARING, 

2814
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:04,612
BECAUSE YOU WERE ASKED -- 

2815
01:18:04,612 --> 01:18:05,780
>> ABOUT THE HEARING TOMORROW.

2816
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,450
YOU WERE ASKED EARLIER ABOUT THE

2817
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,718
MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE SENDING TO 

2818
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:10,985
THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY.

2819
01:18:10,985 --> 01:18:12,220
WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT YOU 

2820
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,823
MAY BE SENDING TO YOUNG MEN?

2821
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:15,690
YOU'RE A FATHER.

2822
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,058
WHAT DOES THIS MOMENT THAT WE'RE

2823
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:18,693
IN, THE CULTURAL MOMENT -- 

2824
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,962
>> IT'S A VERY BIG CULTURAL 

2825
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:21,296
MOMENT.

2826
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:21,863
>> RIGHT.

2827
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:22,964
WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU SENDING TO 

2828
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:24,232
THE YOUNG MEN OF AMERICA?

2829
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:24,632
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

2830
01:18:24,632 --> 01:18:26,434
I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

2831
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:27,803
THIS IS A VERY BIG MOMENT FOR 

2832
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:31,139
OUR COUNTRY.

2833
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:31,773
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS 

2834
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,708
VERY OUTSTANDING, BUT HE'S GOT 

2835
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,777
VERY STRONG CHARGES AGAINST HIM.

2836
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,580
PROBABLY CHARGES THAT NOBODY'S 

2837
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:43,118
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVE.

2838
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,019
SO, I COULD HAVE YOU CHOSEN FOR 

2839
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:48,056
A POSITION, I COULD HAVE YOU OR 

2840
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,324
YOU, ANYBODY, AND SOMEBODY COULD

2841
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,760
SAY -- AND IT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

2842
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,528
MANY TIMES.

2843
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:56,698
WHERE FALSE STATEMENTS ARE MADE.

2844
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,868
AND HONESTLY, NOBODY KNOWS WHO 

2845
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:00,635
TO BELIEVE.

2846
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:04,506
I COULD PICK ANOTHER SUPREME 

2847
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,074
COURT JUSTICE, I COULD PICK 

2848
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,008
ANOTHER ONE, ANOTHER ONE, 

2849
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:08,076
ANOTHER ONE, THIS COULD GO ON 

2850
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,711
FOREVER.

2851
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:11,479
SOMEBODY COULD COME AND SAY, 30 

2852
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:13,781
YEARS AGO, 25 YEARS AGO, 10 

2853
01:19:13,781 --> 01:19:17,752
YEARS AGO, 5 YEARS AGO, HE DID A

2854
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:18,219
HORRIBLE THING TO ME.

2855
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:19,354
HE DID THIS, HE DID THAT, HE DID

2856
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:21,957
THAT.

2857
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:25,159
AND HONESTLY, IT'S A VERY 

2858
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,161
DANGEROUS PERIOD IN OUR COUNTRY.

2859
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,597
AND IT'S BEING PERPETRATED BY 

2860
01:19:29,597 --> 01:19:32,166
SOME VERY EVIL PEOPLE, SOME OF 

2861
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:35,770
THEM ARE DEMOCRATS, I MUST SAY, 

2862
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:36,771
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM KNOW THAT 

2863
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:37,439
THIS IS JUST A GAME THAT THEY'RE

2864
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,574
PLAYING.

2865
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,142
IT'S A CON GAME, IT'S AT THE 

2866
01:19:41,142 --> 01:19:42,744
HIGHEST LEVEL.

2867
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,146
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED 

2868
01:19:45,146 --> 01:19:46,081
STATES SUPREME COURT.

2869
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,816
THIS CAN GO ON FOREVER.

2870
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,418
I CAN PICK FIVE OTHER PEOPLE AT 

2871
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:51,252
A CERTAIN POINT, PEOPLE ARE 

2872
01:19:51,252 --> 01:19:52,854
GOING TO SAY, NO THANK YOU.

2873
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:57,025
THIS IS THE MOST COVETED JOB, 

2874
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:57,893
PROBABLY IN THE WORLD.

2875
01:19:57,893 --> 01:19:59,527
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WOULD 

2876
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:00,729
HONESTLY SAY, BECAUSE I 

2877
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:01,396
INTERVIEWED GREAT PEOPLE FOR 

2878
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:04,532
THIS JOB, HE'S GREAT, BUT I 

2879
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:05,199
INTERVIEWED OTHER GREAT PEOPLE 

2880
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,268
FOR THIS JOB.

2881
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:09,971
I COULD CONCEIVABLY IMAGINE 

2882
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,474
GOING TO ONE OF THEM AND SAYING,

2883
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,777
IT'S TOO BAD WHAT HAPPENED TO 

2884
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:18,480
THIS WONDERFUL MAN.

2885
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,881
BUT I'M GOING TO CHOOSE YOU 

2886
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:21,182
NUMBER TWO.

2887
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:23,718
I WANT YOU TO GO, AND I COULD 

2888
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:25,453
CONCEIVABLY BE TURNED DOWN BY 

2889
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:28,223
SOMEBODY THAT DESPERATELY WANTED

2890
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,524
THIS JOB TWO MONTHS AGO.

2891
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:30,258
SO, THIS IS -- 

2892
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:31,493
>> WITH RESPECT SIR -- 

2893
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,329
>> THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME COURT.

2894
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,163
THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND SUPREME 

2895
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:35,763
COURT, THIS IS BEYOND SUPREME 

2896
01:20:35,763 --> 01:20:38,433
COURT.

2897
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,268
THIS IS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH 

2898
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,369
OUR COUNTRY.

2899
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:45,473
WHEN YOU ARE GUILTY, UNTIL 

2900
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,108
PROVEN INNOCENT, IT'S JUST NOT 

2901
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:50,078
SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.

2902
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:51,479
ALWAYS I HEARD YOU'RE INNOCENT 

2903
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:52,781
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

2904
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,048
I'VE HEARD THIS FOR SO LONG AND 

2905
01:20:54,048 --> 01:20:56,785
IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PHRASE.

2906
01:20:56,785 --> 01:21:00,722
IN THIS CASE, YOU'RE GUILTY 

2907
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,325
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.

2908
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,492
I THINK THAT IS A VERY, VERY 

2909
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:07,162
DANGEROUS STANDARD FOR OUR 

2910
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:07,395
COUNTRY.

2911
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:08,896
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I LOOK 

2912
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:11,766
FORWARD TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

2913
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:13,768
I ALSO LOOK VERY FORWARD TO WHAT

2914
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,770
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS TO SAY.

2915
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,905
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY,

2916
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:21,776
VERY IMPORTANT DAY IN THE 

2917
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,244
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

2918
01:21:23,244 --> 01:21:24,779
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL.

2919
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:25,613
WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

2920
01:21:25,613 --> 01:21:27,415
>> SIR, THE MESSAGE TO YOUNG 

2921
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:27,581
MEN?

2922
01:21:27,581 --> 01:21:28,583
YOUNG TEENAGER MEN?

2923
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:34,356
NOTHING TO SAY, SIR?

2924
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:34,923
>> WELL, THAT WAS SOMETHING.

2925
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:35,756
ABOUT AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES 

2926
01:21:35,756 --> 01:21:38,093
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, 

2927
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,761
FREE-WHEELING, AT TIMES 

2928
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,262
FACTUALLY CHALLENGED PRESS 

2929
01:21:41,262 --> 01:21:41,562
CONFERENCE.

2930
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:42,831
CRITICIZED THE FEDERAL RESERVE 

2931
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:43,999
FOR RAISING INTEREST RATES.

2932
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,801
CRITICISM FOR CHINA.

2933
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,569
SEEMED TO SAY THERE WAS NOT 

2934
01:21:48,569 --> 01:21:49,971
GOING TO BE A TRADE DEAL WITH 

2935
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,439
CANADA AND CHINA.

2936
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,640
CRITICIZING THEIR INTERFERENCE 

2937
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,541
IN OUR ELECTION.

2938
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,377
AND THE PRESIDENT, THE HEART OF 

2939
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:57,879
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, OF COURSE,

2940
01:21:57,879 --> 01:21:59,247
THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT BRETT 

2941
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,615
KAVANAUGH, THREE WOMEN HAVE NOW 

2942
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,717
COME FORWARD WITH ACCUSATIONS 

2943
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:03,217
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH.

2944
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:05,286
THE PRESIDENT CALLED THEM FALSE 

2945
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:07,155
ACCUSATIONS, CALLED THIS ALL, 

2946
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:09,457
RETURNED TO THIS PHRASE MANY 

2947
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,226
TIMES, A BIG CON JOB RUN BY 

2948
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:11,493
DEMOCRATS.

2949
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:12,894
ALSO QUESTIONED WHY THE WOMEN 

2950
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:13,761
HADN'T COME FORWARD EARLIER, BUT

2951
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:15,563
AT THE SAME TIME, SAYING HE'S 

2952
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:18,400
LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT 

2953
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,734
DR. FORD HAS TO SAY TOMORROW.

2954
01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:22,137
AND THAT HE COULD MAKE UP HIS 

2955
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,204
MIND AFTER HEARING THAT.

2956
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:25,640
I WANT TO BRING IN JON KARL, OUR

2957
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,674
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.

2958
01:22:26,674 --> 01:22:28,209
JON, IT'S HARD TO SUMMARIZE THAT

2959
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:30,211
IN JUST A FEW WORDS.

2960
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,813
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HE HELPED 

2961
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:34,215
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S CASE TODAY.

2962
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:35,617
>> AH, NO, GEORGE.

2963
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,085
FIRST OF ALL, AN EXTRAORDINARY 

2964
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,186
PERFORMANCE BY THE PRESIDENT.

2965
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:40,288
BUT HE WAS ALL OVER THE MAP.

2966
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,023
AT SOME POINTS, CALLING THIS A 

2967
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:43,891
CON JOB, ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS 

2968
01:22:43,891 --> 01:22:44,926
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH.

2969
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:47,095
AT OTHER TIMES, SOUNDING LIKE HE

2970
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,563
MIGHT WELL CUT HIM LOOSE, IF HE 

2971
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:49,998
DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE HEARS AT 

2972
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:50,398
THE HEARING.

2973
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:53,401
HE EVEN SAID, GEORGE, THAT HE 

2974
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,169
MAY CANCEL HIS MUCH-ANTICIPATED 

2975
01:22:55,169 --> 01:22:57,137
MEETING WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

2976
01:22:57,137 --> 01:22:59,374
GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN TOMORROW 

2977
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,741
BECAUSE HE WANTS THE FOCUS, ALL 

2978
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:02,710
THE FOCUS INCLUDING HIS OWN 

2979
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:04,178
FOCUS, TO BE ON THAT HEARING 

2980
01:23:04,178 --> 01:23:07,782
TOMORROW WITH KAVANAUGH AND HIS 

2981
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,217
ACCUSER, CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.

2982
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:10,752
>> AND THE PRESIDENT ADMITTING 

2983
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,153
HIS OWN EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN 

2984
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,888
MAKING ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM 

2985
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,390
FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALSO 

2986
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,126
HAVING A GREAT IMPACT ON HIS -- 

2987
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:20,295
ON HIS VIEWS ON THIS MATTER.

2988
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:21,463
WE'RE GOING TO SIGN OFF RIGHT 

2989
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:22,297
NOW, OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO 

2990
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:23,765
BE COVERING THAT HEARING 

2991
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,066
TOMORROW LIVE STARTING AT 10:00 

2992
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:26,701
