When I’m beginning to dance on the train,
my hands, my palms always sweat.
But it's like, it's an
adrenaline rush.
I just wait for the music to
come on and get in my zone,
and I just block everything out
and just listen for the beat.
And I'm like in my own world,
where it's just like
I'm walking on air and space.
And it’s like no one is there.
But I know that someone
is watching.
I made it my business to know
how to maneuver around people,
what obstacles are there,
so we can look smooth, look clean
and the show is a good show
without corrupting something
and disturbing the peace.
A lot of people get on a train
and get out some anger
and get out a loss.
They come and dance and
let it go, be free.
