00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,585
HUSBAND LAST YEAR HAS HAD A OPEN

LETTER TO HIM AND ASKING HIM TO

20
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:40,256

HAS EXPERIENCED THREATS AT A

24
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:49,565
HORRIFYING LEVEL."

25
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:49,999
WELCOME KELLY.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,667
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

27
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:52,568
>> Shannon: WHAT MADE YOU AT

28
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:55,538
THIS POINT REACH OUT.

29
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:56,539
WE ALWAYS MEMBER YOUR HUSBAND

30
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,741
WAS AT THE SHOOTING LESTER THAT

31
00:00:58,742 --> 00:00:59,842
ALMOST KILLED A CONGRESSMAN.

32
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:03,546
HE WAS PERSONALLY ATTACKED.

33
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:04,347
SERIOUS LUNG DAMAGE.

34
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:05,548
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF

35
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,016
HIS INJURIES AND WHERE WE AT NOW

36
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:10,620
FOR YOU GUYS?

37
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,988
>> I WAS MOTIVATED TO WRITE THE

38
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,525
LETTER JUST FOR ME.

39
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:16,959
INCREDIBLE ACTIVITIES I HAVE

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,995
WATCHED THE LAST WEEK.

41
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,663
SEEING HEIDI AND TED CRUZ FORCED

42
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,397
OUT OF THEIR RESTAURANT IN D.C.

43
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:24,133
LAST WEEK.

44
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,134
PEOPLE IN THEIR FACE.

45
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:26,936
WAVING THEIR MIDDLE FINGER,

46
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:27,503
GETTING IN THEIR FACE.

47
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,273
NOT ALLOWING THEM TO EVEN EAT

48
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:33,643
THEIR MEAL AND THEN WHEN THEIR

49
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:35,478
HOME ADDRESS WAS RELEASED ON THE

50
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,980
INTERNET IN KENTUCKY AND HIS

51
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,382
CELL PHONE NUMBER WAS RELEASED.

52
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:41,484
I FELT INCREDIBLY THREATENED AND

53
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:41,884
FRIGHTENED.

54
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:44,921
I HAD BEEN FRIED WHEN HE LEFT

55
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:46,923
FOR D.C. THAT WEEKEND.

56
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:48,057
THE NEW MESSAGES GET UP IN THEIR

57
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:48,357
FACE.

58
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,960
GET UP IN PEOPLE'S FACE.

59
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:52,128
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE

60
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,931
JUST HOW THREATENING THAT FEELS.

61
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:56,966
HOW VIOLATED YOU FEEL WHEN

62
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:57,934
SOMEBODY INVADES YOUR PERSONAL

63
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:58,468
SPACE LIKE THAT.

64
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,269
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP TO

65
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,905
MOVE THE DISCOURSE ALONG.

66
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:05,308
THE NIGHT I WROTE THAT I WAS

67
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,744
SITTING IN MY HOUSE AND I SAW

68
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,847
THE SHERIFF'S CAR GO BY MY CAR

69
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:11,814
AND I WAS GRATEFUL FOR IT.

70
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:14,250
I WAS GRATEFUL FOR THEIR

71
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,885
SURVEILLANCE OF OUR HOME.

72
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,754
I JUST FELT SO SAD.

73
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:19,655
HOW DO WE GET HERE?

74
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:24,560
I WANT TO READ SOMETHING FROM

75
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,362
BOOKER, HE THINKS THAT CLIP WAS

76
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:32,535
TAKEN OUT OF THE CONTENT.

77
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:33,569
A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION

78
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,770
DEDICATED TO END HOMELESSNESS

79
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,973
AND TELL THEM ABOUT COMMENTS AND

80
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:37,340
SOLUTIONS.

81
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,442
HE SAID I DON'T WANT TO HATE

82
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:41,310
ANYBODY BECAUSE I KNOW THE

83
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:46,549
TRUTH.

84
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,751
WE HAVE SEEN ON THE HILL OVER

85
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,953
THE LAST FEW DAYS DEMOCRATS AND

86
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,221
REPUBLICANS ALIKE, AND ON MANY

87
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:53,723
OF THEM CHOOSING TO WALK WITH

88
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,358
POLICE ESCORTS BECAUSE WE HAVE

89
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,893
SEEN THE HALLWAYS AND THE

90
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:57,226
THREATS.

91
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,095
THIS HAS HAPPENED BOTH TIMES IN

92
00:02:59,096 --> 00:02:59,462
THE AISLE.

93
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,264
HOW DOES IT CHANGE?

94
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,666
>> ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I

95
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,934
ADDRESS MY LETTER TO

96
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:05,668
SENATOR BOOKER'S BECAUSE HE AND

97
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:07,970
RAND HAVE WORKED TOGETHER ON A

98
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:09,772
BIPARTISAN WAY.

99
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,374
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I FEEL REALLY

100
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,542
PASSIONATELY ABOUT.

101
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:14,310
I'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH THE

102
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,379
GROUP CALLED JUSTICE ACTION

103
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,146
NETWORK.

104
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:21,951
WE ARE PUSHING FOR THE FIRST

105
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,954
STEP.

106
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,123
I WAS PREPARING TO COME TO D.C.

107
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,258
FOR A CONFERENCE AT MICROSOFT

108
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:32,528
TOMORROW AND I STARTED THINKING,

109
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,397
THE WORLD IS SO POLARIZED RIGHT

110
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:34,931
NOW APPEAR.

111
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:36,566
I FEAR THAT WE WILL NEVER BE

112
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:37,466
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON ANY OF

113
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,136
THESE ISSUES.

114
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,938
WORDS DO MATTER AND PERHAPS HE

115
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:43,039
DIDN'T MEAN IT AND SUCH AN

116
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,408
AGGRESSIVE WAY BUT WHEN YOU ARE

117
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,543
THE RECIPIENTS OF PEOPLE GETTING

118
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,145
UP IN YOUR FACE, IT DOES FEEL

119
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,715
EXTREMELY PERSONAL.

120
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:53,950
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SINCE HE

121
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,751
HAS BEEN SHOT AT AND PHYSICALLY

122
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:58,754
ATTACKED IN THE LAST YEAR, AND

123
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,723
THEN ON THE HEELS OF OUR

124
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,725
PERSONAL HOME ADDRESS BEING

125
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:03,726
RELEASED, I FELT EXTREMELY

126
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:04,126
VULNERABLE.

127
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:07,330
I FELT EXTREMELY THREATENED.

128
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,533
I HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE BEYOND

129
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:10,833
THIS.

130
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,335
WHATEVER HAPPENS WITH THE

131
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:12,969
CONFIRMATION.

132
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,104
I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE

133
00:04:15,105 --> 00:04:15,938
BEYOND THIS.

134
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,974
TO FIND SOME SOLUTIONS FOR

135
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:18,741
THINGS LIKE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

136
00:04:18,742 --> 00:04:21,277
REFORM IN SPIRIT IN THE PAST IT

137
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:26,349
HAS BROUGHT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

138
00:04:26,350 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES OF THIS
