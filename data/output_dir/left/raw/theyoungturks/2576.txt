1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,979
>>A LAWSUIT AGAINST FLORIDA
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SOUGHT TO

2
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:06,640
OVERTURN AN EFFECTIVE BAN ON
RESTORING THE VOTING RIGHTS

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:15,559
OF FORMER FELONS, AND NOW WE
HAVE A VERDICT ON 

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:16,559
IT --

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,100
>>THEY HAD ALREADY PAID THEIR
DEBT TO SOCIETY AND THEY WANTED

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,650
TO START PARTICIPATING IN
SOCIETY ONCE AGAIN, WHICH IN

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,560
MANY STATES IS SOMETHING YOU CAN
DO, BUT IT'S HARDER IN SOME AND

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,910
DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE AND OTHERS,
LIKE FLORIDA, BUT PERHAPS

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,070
NOT IN THE FUTURE --

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:01:13,780
>>MARK WALKER, IMPRESSIVE
WRITTEN OPINION.

11
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,160
>>THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S
DONE AND FIXED TODAY BUT MARK

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,410
WALKER WILL BE HOLDING HEARINGS
IN FEBRUARY AND THAT IS A

13
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,280
GOOD FIRST STEP.

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,470
>>THAT OUTLINES HOW RIDICULOUS
THE PROCESS IS.

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,760
ESSENTIALLY YOU

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,530
DRAG YOUR CASE BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE AND ULTIMATELY AFTER

17
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,000
YOU'VE MADE YOUR CASE, AND EVEN
THIS COMMITTEE, WHICH IS LIKELY

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,030
STACKED AGAINST YOU, SAYS OKAY,
VOTING RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD GET

19
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,671
THEM BACK, EXCEPT THE GOVERNOR
CAN OVERTURN THAT.

20
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,671
THAT IS

21
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,920
ESSENTIALLY THE WAY IT IS SET UP
IN FLORIDA.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,890
>>AND HOW ARE YOU VOTING, BY THE
WAY?

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,970
>>THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT.

24
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,480
>>ALSO THERE IS A 10,000 PERSON
BACK LOG OF APPLICANTS TO TRY TO

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,600
GET THEIR VOTING RIGHTS
RESTORED.

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
AND FELONIES BY THE

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,260
WAY ARE ALSO NONVIOLENT DRUG
OFFENSES AND ROBBERY.

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,780
SO AGAIN,

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,729
THESE AREN'T RAPISTS AND
MURDERERS IN EVERY CASE.

30
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,878
>>OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WOULD
BE A FELONY.

31
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,940
WHICH JUST COMES TO

32
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,940
MIND.

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,239
>>FOR WHATEVER REASON.

34
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,450
AND THIS
IS ONE OF THE TOPICS, I'VE SEEN

35
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,629
TUCKER CARLSON TALK ABOUT THIS,
THEY WANT FELONS TO VOTE.

36
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:21,629
AND

37
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,090
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT NO MATTER
WHAT THE TOPIC OR THE

38
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,709
INTELLECTUAL MERIT, YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO FEEL WEIRD AND BAD

39
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,489
ABOUT SAYING ANYTHING POSITIVE
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS BROKEN THE

40
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:33,489
LAW.

41
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:34,489
THEY ARE JUST TERRIBLE,
DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY WENT TO

42
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,010
JAIL ALREADY -- BUT
PHILOSOPHICALLY WHY SHOULDN'T

43
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,430
THEY BE ABLE TO VOTE?

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,400
YOU TALKED
ABOUT THE NONVIOLENT CRIMES,

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,890
OKAY, WHAT IF THEY BEAT THE SHIT
OUT OF SOMEONE AND THEY GO TO

46
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,239
JAIL FOR 10 YEARS AND THEY ARE
OUT.

47
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,430
WHY ARE THEY BANNED FROM

48
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,829
PARTICIPATING IN DEMOCRACY?

49
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,859
THAT
SEEMS LIKE THE SORT OF THING

50
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:53,780
THAT WOULD HELP REINTEGRATE
SOMEONE INTO SOCIETY.

51
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,019
YOU ARE

52
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,200
EXPECTED TO AGREE WITH IT BY THE
RIGHT WING THAT FELONS ARE THE

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,779
WORST PEOPLE AND THEY SHOULDN'T
BE ALLOWED TO VOTE, AND

54
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,499
THERE IS NO LOGICAL UNDERPINNING
FOR THAT.

55
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:05,969
>>IT'S ALSO HOW THEY PAINT
IMMIGRANTS, IN THE WORST WAY.

56
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:11,620
BUT IF THE STATE DEEMS YOU
WORTHY OF BEING RELEASED YOU

57
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,230
SHOULD BE WORTHY OF THE VOTE.

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,659
IF
YOU PAID YOUR DEBT TO THE POINT

59
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,999
THAT YOU WERE RELEASED FROM
INCARCERATION YOU SHOULD BE

60
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:21,430
ALLOWED TO VOTE, PARTICULARLY
SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

61
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,739
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT VOTE THAT
ARE INVOLVED IN THE PRISON

62
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,739
SYSTEM.

63
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,889
THE PRIVATIZATION OF
PRISONS, CORRUPTION IN THE

64
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,510
PRISON SYSTEM, THESE ARE THINGS
THAT ARE HANDLED BY VOTING.

65
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,510
HERE

66
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,510
IS SOMEONE WHO JUST CAME OUT OF
THE PRISON SYSTEM, THEY

67
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,980
SHOULD HAVE A WINDOW ON THIS.

68
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,799
>>THIS COULD SET A PRECEDENT FOR
OTHER STATES, I THINK IT'S FOR

69
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,330
THE POSITIVE AND I KNOW THERE
ARE PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS

70
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,689
CAMPAIGN, THAT'S SUPER
IMPORTANT.

71
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,689
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

72
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,859
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM AND

73
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:58,420
CLASSISM IN WAYS THAT -- IT'S
FUNNY, I LIVED IN LATIN AMERICA

74
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,829
FOR A WHILE AND VOTING IS
MANDATORY, YOU HAVE TO VOTE.

75
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:02,829
SO

76
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:03,829
WHAT HAPPENS?

77
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:04,829
YOU BUY OFF THE
POOR PEOPLE.

78
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:05,829
BUT WHEN VOTING

79
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,430
ISN'T MANDATORY YOU JUST TRY TO
TAKE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS AWAY,

80
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,939
PEOPLE WHO ARE MINORITIES OR
OPPRESSED OR WHATEVER.

81
00:04:15,939 --> 00:00:00,000
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE STEP IN
CHANGING THAT.
