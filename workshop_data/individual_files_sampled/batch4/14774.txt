Jason Kenny just overwhelms people at the provincial level with his organizational ability he has a superb organizational team around them they helped run the successful federal Tory campaigns and they they operate at a level that very few people in any party on the provincial level operate and you know I said that to people I know in the in the NDP here a couple of weeks ago when they said what do you think do you think Kenny Kenny's going to win I said I know Ken he's going to win he's just that much better organiser he's a better organiser than any of your people put together this into the NDP and they Blanche that that they said how can you say that we we pride ourselves and I get off the vote and our you know our ability to get them the message out on social media and and you know sort of the old the gumshoe kind of attitude through through the unions and I said no you just don't understand I mean he knows organization that level you have never seen and so I wasn't surprised at all that Kenny won handily yeah I mean Kenny operated at a very senior level federally with Stephen Harper Kenny was really involved in ethnic outreach which many he was running local campaigns all across Canada especially in the big cities Toronto Montreal Vancouver so he's used to operating at a high level and I think it's also the other side Alberta in some ways is a very underdeveloped political organizational culture because for the last 40 years you just put the Tory lon sign up and the Tory wins you don't really have to do a lot of spade work you don't have to fight for every vote Kenny's used to the fight for every vote against the dominant liberals so he so with accommodation he's good and the Alberta political scene is actually fairly complacent I think that's absolutely that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
