1
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:13,651
>> Sandra: THIS IS A FOX NEWS

2
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:14,685
ALERT.

3
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:15,486
MOMENTS AGO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

4
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:16,787
COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED IT WILL

5
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:17,889
SUBPOENA PETER STRZOK.

6
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,690
THAT'S THE FBI AGENT REMOVED

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,093
FROM THE RUSSIAN PROBE AFTER THE

8
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:24,962
DISCOVERY OF THOSE ANTI-TRUMPET

9
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,631
TEXTS THAT HE EXCHANGED WITH FBI

10
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:28,232
LAWYER LISA PAGE WHO WAS ALSO

11
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:31,302
HIS LOVER.

12
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:34,305
IF STRZOK WERE TO TESTIFY,

13
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:35,473
SOMETHING'S ATTORNEY INDICATES

14
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:41,212
HE'S WILLING TO DO, IT COULDN'T

15
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:45,516
IMPACT THAT BY HIS PROBE AND

16
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:46,517
CONGRESSMAN JOINS US NOW.

17
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:47,718
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT.

18
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:50,688
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS NEWS?

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,258
HE'S OFFICIALLY BEEN SUBPOENAED

20
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:54,825
TO TESTIFY.

21
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:57,194
>> I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO APPEAR

22
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:58,696
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

23
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:01,666
WE INVITED HIM TO APPEAR

24
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,467
VOLUNTARILY OR BE SUBPOENAED.

25
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,369
HE ORIGINALLY SAID HE WOULD, AND

26
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,470
NOW HE'S BEEN SUBPOENAED.

27
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,173
HE'S A CENTRAL WITNESS IN VOLTA

28
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:09,907
HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL

29
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:12,510
INVESTIGATION AND OF THE

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,312
TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION CASE THAT

31
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:14,946
BECAME THE SPECIAL COUNSEL

32
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:15,546
MATTER.

33
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:16,881
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE HIM

34
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:20,952
APPEAR AND EXPLAIN THESE TEXT

35
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:21,886
MESSAGES AS WELL AS HIS ACTIONS

36
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:24,889
TAKEN IN BOTH OF THESE MATTERS.

37
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:26,724
SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT

38
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:28,392
THAT HE WILL EVENTUALLY APPEAR

39
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:32,496
AND EITHER ANSWER QUESTIONS, OR

40
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:33,130
ASSERT HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT

41
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,464
RIGHTS.

42
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:35,933
EITHER WAY IT WILL TELL US A LOT

43
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:36,801
ABOUT PETER STRZOK.

44
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:37,535
>> Sandra: OF COURSE WE HAVE

45
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,270
ALL HAD THE CHANCE TO SEE AND

46
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,505
HEAR THIS TEXT MESSAGES BY NOW

47
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:43,841
AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS

48
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:45,142
ANTI-TRUMPET BIAS IN THOSE TEXT

49
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:48,112
MESSAGES, AND A LOT OF IT.

50
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,180
HOWEVER, THE IG REPORT FOUND

51
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,849
THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF

52
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:56,754
THIS

53
00:01:56,754 --> 00:02:01,559
USED IN DECISION-MAKING.

54
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,760
>> I THINK THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

55
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,528
EQUIVOCATED A LITTLE BIT FROM

56
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:07,064
THE WRITTEN WORD.

57
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:11,302
HE CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

58
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:13,037
PETER STRZOK HAD AN ASTONISHING

59
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:18,109
LEVEL OF BIAS.

60
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,244
HE ALSO TODAY INDICATED THAT IN

61
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:23,114
AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE, PETER

62
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:24,682
STRZOK ALLOWED THAT ACTION TO

63
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:25,449
INFLUENCE HIS BIAS AS IT RELATES

64
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:31,689
TO THE RECOVERY OF 100,000

65
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,025
EMAILS ON ANTHONY WEINER'S AND

66
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,693
HUMA ABEDIN'S LAPTOP THAT WERE

67
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:36,560
NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,165
SO I THOUGHT HE OPENED THE DOOR

69
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:42,767
TODAY TO THE IDEA THAT BIAS

70
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,902
REALLY DID IMPACT BOTH OF THESE

71
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,704
VERY IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIONS.

72
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:50,574
SO YOU KNOW, WE ALL WANT THE

73
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:54,678
OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO THE TRUTH.

74
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:55,513
I THINK THAT PETER STRZOK'S

75
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:56,213
CREDIBILITY ULTIMATELY WILL

76
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:58,916
IMPACT NOT JUST THE

77
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,886
HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL MATTER,

78
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:03,120
BUT THE TRUMP/RUSSIA

79
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,121
INVESTIGATION.

80
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:04,989
SANDRA, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

81
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,524
YOU UNDERSTAND IS THAT PETER

82
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:07,291
STRZOK WAS THE PERSON OF THE FBI

83
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:11,362
PUT IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING

84
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:11,796
DONALD TRUMP.

85
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:12,997
THE GUY WHO HATED DONALD TRUMP

86
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,031
IS MUCH AS ANYONE WHO'S HAD NOT

87
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:19,570
A SINGLE AMERICAN SHOULD VOTE

88
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,638
FOR HIM AND TALKED ABOUT GETTING

89
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,907
HIM IMPEACHED ONCE HE BECAME

90
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:26,010
PRESIDENT WAS THE ONE COLLECTING

91
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,511
EVIDENCE AND FORMULATING A PLAN

92
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:29,914
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

93
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:31,682
SO HE NEEDS TO, AND ACCOUNT FOR

94
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:33,317
THE THINGS HE HAS SAID AND THE

95
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:34,485
THINGS HE HAS DONE AND WE ARE

96
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:37,121
GOING TO MAKE HIM DO THAT ONE

97
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:37,888
WAY OR ANOTHER.

98
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:40,124
>> Sandra: DOES AT A AND

99
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:41,025
SURPRISE YOU THAT PETER STRZOK

100
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:44,628
STILL HAS A JOB AT THE FBI?

101
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:49,100
OBVIOUSLY HE'S BEEN PULLED OFF

102
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,207
THE CASE, BUT HE STILL THERE.

103
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,808
>> I THINK WE ARE ALL AT A LOSS

104
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:59,710
AS TO WHY HE IS STILL AT THE

105
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,911
FBI.

106
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,514
THE BEST WAY THAT CHRIS WRAY CAN

107
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:04,281
DEFEND THE 13,000 AGENTS, MANY

108
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,917
OF THEM WERE VERY GOOD AT BRAVE

109
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,219
MEN AND WOMEN THAT GO EVERY DAY

110
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,622
TO KHABAROVSK COUNTRY SAFE, IS

111
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:13,090
TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE TO REALLY

112
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,161
BAD ACTORS, AND AT THIS POINT IN

113
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:22,600
TIME, THERE'S NO QUESTION AND AT

114
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,702
THE ASTONISHING LEVEL OF BIAS

115
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:27,104
AND HATRED CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED

116
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:27,872
AND EXPLAINED.

117
00:04:27,872 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Sandra: THAT WAS NOT JUST
