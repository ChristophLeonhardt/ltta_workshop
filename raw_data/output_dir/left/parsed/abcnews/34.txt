>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
>>> AND GOOD MORNING, FOR THOSE 
OF YOU JUST JOINING US, WE ARE 
LIVE COVERING THE NATIONAL WHACK
WH
WALKOUT.
STUDENTS LEAVING CLASS TO DEMAND
ACTION ON GUN CONTROL.
THAT IS THE SCENE IN WASHINGTON 
D.C., A HUGE CROWD GROWING 
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> IT IS A SIGHT TO SEE ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY.
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS 
MORNING MARKS EXACTLY ONE MONTH 
SINCE THAT MASSACRE AT MARJORY 
STONEMAN DOUGLAS.
THAT SHOOTING HAS SPARKED A 
NATIONWIDE CALL TO ACTION.
MORE THAN 3,000 WALKOUTS ARE 
PLANNED. 
>> TODAY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS 
AND TEACHERS ARE LEAVING THEIR 
CLASSROOMS FOR 17 MINUTES TO 
REMEMBER THE 17 VICTIMS KILLED 
LAST MONTH IN PARKLAND.
ABC'S VICTOR OQUENDO IS THERE 
WITH MORE.
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING, 
MICHAEL.
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE LOOKING LIVE AT
THE FOOTBALL FIELD HERE AT 
MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS IN 
PARKLAND.
YOU CAN SEE THE STUDENTS HAVE 
FILED OUT OF THEIR CLASSROOMS, 
MADE THEIR WAY OUT OF HERE.
THIS IS THE MAIN RALLYING POINT 
FOR THEM TODAY.
THAT'S WHERE THEY'LL BE SPENDING
THE 17 MINUTES, ONE MINUTE FOR 
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE VICTIMS.
AS THEY WALKED OUT THIS MORNING,
THEY CAME OUT TO APPLAUSE.
THE COMMUNITY IS OUT HERE AS 
WELL.
THEY WANTED TO LET THEM KNOW 
THEY WERE SUPPORTING THEM.
YOU HEARD CHEERS, THINGS LIKE 
WE'RE WITH YOU, THINGS LIKE MSD,
MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS.
WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS WHO SAY 
THEY WANTED TO MAKE THEIR WAY 
OFF CAMPUS THINKING THEY WOULD 
GET BETTER EXPOSURE, GET THEIR 
MESSAGE OUT THAT WAY.
THERE IS ANOTHER RALLYING AREA 
AT A PARK NEARBY WHERE THERE 
WILL BE A PRAYER SERVICE AND 
STUDENTS WILL GET THE CHANCE TO 
SPEAK THERE AS WELL.
SUPERINTENDENT ROBERT RUNCIE HAS
TOLD STAFF NOT TO GET IN THE 
WAY, NOT INTERFERE, CALLING THIS
A TEACHABLE MOMENT.
LET'S LOOK AT THE FIELD BEHIND 
ME.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SIGNS AS WELL.
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS OUT HERE, 
17 MINUTES, FOR THOSE VICTIMS.
LET'S BRING IN A PARENT WHO HAS 
A CHILD WHO GOES TO STONEMAN 
DOUGLAS, GLORIA DeJESUS.
WHAT IS YOUR SON'S NAME AND WHAT
GRADE IS HE IN?
>> FRANCISCO DeJESUS AND HE IS A
SENIOR GRADUATING THIS YEAR. 
>> IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT 
MIX RIGHT THERE?
>> YES, HE IS. 
>> WHY DID YOU WANT TO BE OUT 
HERE THIS MORNING?
>> BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A VERY 
EMOTIONAL TIME FOR ALL OF US AND
IT'S PART OF OUR HEALING AND I'M
JUST SO PROUD OF THE STUDENTS 
AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
ACCOMPLISH IN CREATING CHANGE 
FOR GUN LAWS.
>> AND THAT'S THE BIG THING THAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO TODAY.
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN ONE BILL THAT
HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR,
A GUN AND SCHOOL SAFETY BILL, 
BUT NOW THEY'RE LOOKING TO MAKE 
SOME MORE CHANGE.
SPECIFICALLY, WHAT HAVE YOU 
TALKED ABOUT WITH YOUR SON WHEN 
IT COMES TO THE RALLY TODAY?
>> WELL, HONESTLY, WE HAVEN'T 
SPOKEN TOO MUCH ABOUT THE RALLY 
BUT HE IS SUPPORTIVE AND HE DOES
WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON TO 
PROTEST. 
>> SO HE'LL BE AT THAT MARCH 
LATER ON THIS MONTH?
>> YES. 
>> GLORIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH AND
THANKS FOR BEING OUT HERE TODAY.
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, THE 
GOVERNOR DID SIGN ONE BILL, A 
GUN AND SCHOOL SAFETY BILL, BUT 
THE KIDS ARE DEMANDING MORE GUN 
CONTROL.
THEY WANT AN ALL OUT BAN ON 
ASSAULT WEAPONS.
THAT'S MR. MTHEIR MESSAGE.
WE'LL BE OUT HERE ALL MORNING 
LONG AS THIS WALKOUT AND RALLY 
CONTINUES TO GROW.
BACK TO YOU. 
>> WE WANT TO TALK TO ONE OF 
THEIR STUDENTS, COLTON HOB.
WHAT IS THE ATMOSPHERE, WHAT'S 
THE MOOD THIS MORNING, COLTON?
>> I BELIEVE THAT ALMOST EVERY 
SING THE STUDENT THAT ATTENDS MY
SCHOOL IS OUT ON THIS FOOTBALL 
FIELD RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO MAKE OUR 
WAY OUT, THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE.
IT'S AMAZING TO SEE THAT 
EVERYBODY WANTS THE CHANGE AND 
EVERYBODY IS READY TO DO THIS 
AND STAND FOR THIS AND THE 
STRENGTH OF OUR COMMUNITY.
YOU CAN SEE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE FENCE THERE'S JUST A LINE OF
PEOPLE.
>> YEAH, WE CAN SEE THAT.
WE'RE SEEING IT ALL ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
WE'RE SEEING PICTURES COME IN 
FROM ALL ACROSS THE EAST COAST 
RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE ALL SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN 
FLORIDA.
WE'VE ALL SEEN HOW YOU 
GALVANIZED PUBLIC OPINION IN 
YOUR STATE.
DID THAT GO FAR ENOUGH FOR YOU 
AND WHAT'S YOUR HOPE FOR THE 
COUNTRY?
>> I HOPE THAT, UM, WE CAN 
DEFINITELY MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER.
WE CAN DEFINITELY CHANGE SOME OF
THE GUN LAWS AND MAKE THEM A 
LITTLE MORE STRICT.
THAT'S A BIG PUSH THAT WE NEED 
TO PUSH FOR AND WE'RE ACTUALLY 
STARTING TO GET SUCCESSFUL WITH 
IT SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE AND THIS WILL BE 
HOPEFULLY OUR LAST SCHOOL 
SHOOTING. 
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU SEE
THOSE OTHER STUDENTS IN HIGH 
SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, 
DO YOU FEEL THAT STRENGTH IN 
NUMBERS, AND HOW DO YOU HOPE TO 
BUILD CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THESE 
COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN, JUST THE WHOLE STRENGTH 
WITH EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY WANTS 
THIS CHANGE.
EVERYONE WANTS TO BE THERE FOR 
EACH OTHER AND I MEAN, MY 
SCHOOL, WE'VE BEEN GETTING SO 
MUCH MAIL FROM ALL THESE SCHOOLS
AND EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO SEND 
PRAYERS AND HOPES AND WE'RE 
TRYING TO SEND BACK THANK YOUS 
AND WE'RE THERE FOR YOU AS WELL 
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
SO WE'RE DEFINITELY MAKING A 
DIFFERENCE HERE TODAY. 
>> YOU GUYS ARE MAKING A 
DIFFERENCE.
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY OWN KIDS' 
SCHOOLS.
GOOD LUCK FOR THE REST OF THE 
DAY.
GO BACK OUT THERE WITH YOUR 
FELLOW CLASSMATES. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THOSE STUDENTS IN PARKLAND 
TAKING THAT CALL FOR GUN CONTROL
ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON WHERE 
IT APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT ISSUE 
IS STALLED AND ON THE BACK 
BURNER.
LET'S GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE NOW 
WHERE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FROM
SCHOOLS IN THAT AREA ARE 
GATHERING OUTSIDE THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO PROTEST AND THAT'S 
WHERE OUR DAVID KERLEY IS FOR A 
MOMENT OF SILENCE AND THEN, 
DAVID, THEY HEAD TO THE CAPITOL.
>> Reporter: MANY MOMENTS OF 
SILENCE, CECILIA.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SCENE HERE.
I'D SAY AT LEAST 2,000 STUDENTS 
ARE HERE.
MANY OF THEM HAVE SAT DOWN IN 
THEIR SILENCE.
IF YOU LOOK IN THE BACK, YOU CAN
ACTUALLY SEE SOME MOVEMENT.
THESE ARE MORE STUDENTS THAT ARE
ARRIVING HERE.
THEY WERE CHANTING AND TURNED 
AROUND AND SAT DOWN WITH THEIR 
BACKS TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
THERE'S THE WHITE HOUSE TO THIS 
SIDE, AND THESE STUDENTS, 
HONESTLY, ARE NOW SEVEN, EIGHT 
MINUTES INTO THIS 17 MINUTES OF 
SILENCE THAT THEY PLANNED TO 
HAVE HERE.
THEY WERE QUITE BOISTEROUS AND 
LOUD AHEAD OF TIME WITH CHANTS 
THAT THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH, IT'S 
TIME FOR CHANGE AGAINST THE NRA.
I'VE ASKED A COUPLE OF STUDENTS 
HERE IF THEY WOULD MIND FOR OUR 
NATIONAL AUDIENCE, IF THEY WOULD
JUST BREAK THIS MOMENT OF 
SILENCE FOR JUST A SECOND TO 
TALK TO US.
THIS IS ABBY SILVERMAN FROM WALT
WOODMAN HIGH SCHOOL IN BETHESDA,
MARYLAND.
I APPRECIATE YOU BREAKING THIS 
MOMENT OF SILENCE THAT YOUR 
FELLOW STUDENTS ARE TAKING PART 
IN.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO BE HERE?
>> WE NEED TO GET THE VOICE OUT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE AREN'T ABLE
TO VOTE YET AND WE JUST WANT YOU
GUYS TO LISTEN TO US.
WE'RE HERE FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE 
A VOICE AND THIS IS OUR WAY OF 
EXPRESSING IT.
WE JUST WANT TO ASK TO BE HEARD.
>> YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS 
HERE.
HAVE YOU GUYS HAD A STRONG 
FEELING ABOUT GUNS BEFORE?
WAS IT PARKLAND?
TELL ME WHY YOU CAME. 
>> IT REALLY STARTED WITH SANDY 
HOOK.
WE JUST FELT THAT WE DON'T FEEL 
SAFE IN SCHOOL ANYMORE AND THIS 
IS A PROBLEM.
SCHOOL IS A PLACE WHERE WE 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO AND FEEL 
SAFE AND LEARN AND NOT HAVE TO 
FEAR THAT SOMETHING MIGHT 
HAPPEN.
WE SHOULDN'T BE SCARED WHEN 
THERE'S A FIRE DRILL THAT 
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN. 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS NOT HERE IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY.
DO YOU THINK YOUR MESSAGE WILL 
STILL BE HEARD?
>> YEAH, I THINK OUR VOICES WILL
BE HEARD AND THEY NEED TO BE 
HEARD. 
>> WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
>> PATRICIA ROJAS. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
A LOT OF THESE STUDENTS FROM 
MARYLAND AND THE VIRGINIA AREAS 
AS YOU MENTIONED, AND AFTERWARDS
THEY PLAN TO STAY HERE FOR A 
LITTLE BIT.
I HAD ANOTHER STUDENT TO TALK TO
BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO 
AHEAD AND SEND IT -- LET ME GET 
KEVIN BUTLER QUICKLY.
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO COME 
TODAY?
>> TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE 
STRICTER GUN LAWS. 
>> DO YOU THINK YOUR VOICE WILL 
BE HEARD EVEN THOUGH THE 
PRESIDENT ISN'T HERE TODAY. 
>> I'M PRETTY SURE IT WOULD.
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE -- EVEN
IF I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE IT, 
OTHERS WILL. 
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
GUYS, BACK TO YOU.
THIS PROTEST GOING TO 10:17 AND 
THEN WE WILL HEAR THE CHANTS 
AGAIN. 
>> DAVID, THANK YOU.
WE SHOULD NEVER AS A NATION GET 
COMFORTABLE HEARING CHILDREN SAY
THEY DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN SCHOOL.
>> HARD TO BELIEVE.
AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'RE
SEEING THESE PROTESTS, A RIPPLE 
ACROSS THE TIME ZONES BUT SOME 
SCHOOLS ARE TURNING INTO AN ALL 
DAY EVENT.
I WENT TO GO TO STEVE OSUNSAMI 
IN ATLANTA.
AN ENTIRE STUDENT BODY 
PARTICIPATING, RIGHT, STEVE?
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, I 
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR AND 
SEE THEM.
WE'VE GOT OVER 1,000 STUDENTS IN
FRONT OF THE SCHOOL WHO ARE OUT 
HERE DEMONSTRATING.
THEY'RE HAVING ESSENTIALLY A 
PROGRAM THAT'S TAKING PLACE 
TODAY.
JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS ONE OF 
THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS.
SHE IS A SENIOR AT THIS HIGH 
SCHOOL.
HER NAME IS LISA MEDFORD.
SHE'S GOT TO LEAVE US IN A FEW 
SECONDS BECAUSE SHE HAS A FEW 
PEOPLE TO INTRODUCE UP HERE, BUT
SHE'S BEEN ONE OF THE VOICES IN 
THIS TODAY.
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, NOT EVERY 
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE ATLANTA 
AREA IS ALLOWING THIS, RIGHT?
>> NO.
WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE A STAFF AND
ADMINISTRATION WHO IS SUPPORTIVE
IN OUR ACTIONS AS WELL AS THE 
DEKALB SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT 
SUPPORTS THIS STUDENT MOVEMENT 
AND OUR STUDENT VOICE IS BEING 
HEARD IN THIS SITUATION WHERE WE
NEED TO TAKE ACTION AND HAVE HER
VOICES BE HEARD. 
>> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IT 
BEING A STUDENT MOVEMENT AND WE 
WERE TALKING EARLIER, MUCH LIKE 
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE
'60s, YOUNG PEOPLE WERE DRIVING 
THAT BUS.
YOU GUYS ARE DRIVING THIS BUS. 
>> YES. 
>> WAVING OUT THE WINDOW, 
YELLING AT FOLKS. 
>> YES.
WE HAVE BEEN IN A POSITION WHERE
OUR ENTIRE LIVES WE HAVE 
WITNESSED SCHOOL SHOOTING AFTER 
SCHOOL SHOOTING AND WE ARE 
MAKING PARKLAND THAT LAST ONE.
WE ARE STEPPING UP.
WE ARE MAKING OUR VOICES HEARD 
EVEN WHEN THOSE NOT EVEN OLD 
ENOUGH TO VOTE.
WE ARE OUT HERE.
WE ARE TELLING LOCAL AND 
NATIONAL POLITICIANS THAT THIS 
NEEDS TO END.
YOU NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION AND
COMMON SENSE GUN CONTROL THAT 
WILL ENABLE OUR SAFETY TO BE A 
PRIORITY WITHIN THIS NATION. 
>> YOU GUYS ARE REGISTERING 
SENIORS TO VOTE TODAY, TOO?
>> YES.
AFTER THIS EVENT IN OUR LIBRARY 
WE ARE HAVING ALL SERNIORS AND 
THOSE ELIGIBLE TO SIGN UP TO 
VOTE. 
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING US.
WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE 
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON TALKING
TO STUDENTS.
BACK TO YOU. 
>> STEVE, BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU, 
YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME 
DISTRICTS ARE NOT ALLOWING THE 
STUDENTS TO PROTEST BUT STUDENTS
ARE DEFYING THAT AS WELL?
>> Reporter: WE WERE TOLD THAT 
THERE WERE SOME SCHOOLS WHERE 
THE STUDENTS WERE INTENDING TO 
WALK OUT ANYWAY, SO THAT IS 
HAPPENING NOW.
WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF THIS 
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN SCHOOL 
DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T ALLOWING 
STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE, THOSE 
STUDENTS ACTUALLY DO SO ANYWAY. 
>> STEVE OSUNSAMI, THANKS VERY 
MUCH. 
>> THESE STUDENTS ARE SO 
PASSIONATE AND COMMITTED TO 
CHANGE AND THESE WALK-OFFS ARE 
GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE WEST 
COAST LATER I'M SURE BUT THEY'RE
HAPPENING ON THE EAST COAST 
RIGHT NOW.
HERE IN NEW YORK MORE THAN 1500 
STUDENTS ARE WALKING OUT OF JOHN
F. KENNEDY HIGH AND ABC'S 
LINLINZIE
JANIS IS THERE. 
>> Reporter: YOU CAN SEE 
HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS GATHERING 
BEHIND ME.
ONE STUDENT CAME OUT AND STARTED
WITH, IF OUR LEADERS AREN'T 
GOING TO PROTECT US AGAINST 
VIOLENCE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
STAND UP FOR OURSELVES.
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A MOMENT 
OF SILENCE.
THEY'VE ALSO BEEN READING 
THROUGH EACH OF THE NAMES OF THE
17 AND TELLING YOU A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT EACH OF THE VICTIMS.
THEY ALSO READ A POEM FROM ALEX 
S
SHACKTER, ONE OF THE VICTIMS 
FROM STONEMAN DOUGLAS.
IT'S CALLED "LIFE IS LIKE A 
ROLLER COASTER."
HIS WORDS WISE BEYOND HIS YEARS.
THIS IS A MEMORIAL SERVICE.
THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE AGREED 
WITH THEIR SCHOOL BUT WE'RE TOLD
BY A LOT OF THE STUDENTS HERE 
THIS IS ALSO ABOUT PROTEST FOR 
THEM.
MICHAEL.
>> THANK YOU, LINZIE. 
>> LET'S BRING IN MARTHA RADDATZ
IN WASHINGTON AS WELL.
YOU WENT TO PARKLAND RIGHT AFTER
THE SHOOTING, SPENT A LOT OF 
TIME WITH THOSE STUDENTS.
WE COULD HEAR AT THE BEGINNING 
OF THIS BROADCAST WHAT A 
DIFFERENCE THEY HOPED TO MAKE, 
THE KIND OF CONNECTIONS THEY 
HOPED TO FORGE WITH STUDENTS ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
>> Reporter: THEY CERTAINLY DO, 
GEORGE.
WHAT STRUCK ME BEING IN PARKLAND
SO SOON AFTER THE SHOOTING IS 
HOW QUICKLY THESE YOUNG STUDENTS
ORGANIZED, HOW QUICKLY THEY 
LEARNED ABOUT GUN LAWS.
THEY WERE SO ELOQUENT AND SO 
COMPOSED AND MATURE BEYOND THEIR
YEARS.
ONE YOUNG WOMAN, LAUREN HUCK, 14
YEARS OLD, LOST SEVERAL OF HER 
BEST FRIENDS, WAS ABLE TO 
ARTICULATE HER FEELINGS.
TODAY SHE IS TWEETING ABOUT THE 
WALKOUT SAYING, WE ARE WALKING 
OUT FOR THE EMPTY DESKS AND THE 
UNSAID GOOD-BYES.
THIS EPIDEMIC OF SCHOOL 
SHOOTINGS MUST STOP.
THESE ARE THE KIDS WHO WERE 
ORGANIZING ALL THESE PROTESTS 
AND WHO WANT TO COME TO 
WASHINGTON TO MAKE REAL CHANGE. 
>> THAT IS COMING UP ON MARCH 
24th.
WE ARE GOING TO WRAP UP OUR 
SPECIAL REPORT.
IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE THE 
PROTESTS, YOU CAN FOLLOW THEM ON
ABCNEWS.COM.
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN NOW TO 
REGULAR PROGRAMMING.
