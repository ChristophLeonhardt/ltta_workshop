MODERATES ARE ARGUING THAT THESE DREAMERS DESERVE ANSWERS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE NOW. AND MARTHA. Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE NOW WITH MORE, CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN IN ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE DISCHARGE PETITION, JEFF DENHAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE THE 218, IS THAT DONE? WE HAVE UNTIL 9:30 TONIGHT. WE ARE KEEPING THE HOUSE OPEN. WE MAY KEEP IT OPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT BUT ULTIMATELY TONIGHT IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUN IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUN5 IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUNH IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUND IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUNA IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUNL IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUNN IS OUR DEADLINE TO MEET THE JUN. THERE ARE STILL MONDAY'S LEFT WHERE WE COULD BRING THIS UP, BUT OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO EMPOWER THE SPEAKER NOT ONLY WITH THE ROLE THAT I INITIALLY AUTHORED, BUT BY THE DISCHARGE TO GIVE HIM THE LEVERAGE TO ACTUALLY GET WITH THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING FOR. NOT ONLY THE TWO FILLERS WHICH ARE SUPPORT, BORDER SECURITY AND A PERMANENT FIX FOR DREAMERS, BUT A FOUR-COLOR SOLUTION. HE'S GOT TO SELL THAT TO THE REST OF OUR CONFERENCE AND HAVE TO BE WILLING TO PICK UP A BILL AND AS OF NOW WE DON'T HAVE US TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT YET. Martha: I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU GOT A SAY YOU FELT YOU HAD THE 218, THAT THEY WERE GOING TO COME AROUND. ARE THEY BEING PRESSURED BY PAUL RYAN OR KEVIN McCARTHY NOT TO GET ON BOARD WITH YOU? WE HAVE MEMBERS STANDING BY IN THE HOUSE WAITING TO SIGN DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS. ULTIMATELY WITH THE FREEDOM CAUCUS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FOUR PILLARS. Martha: WHO DOES THIS HELP? WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR IT SO HARD? IN TERMS OF THE MIDTERM ELECTION, WHAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT VERSUS WHAT PAUL RYAN IS SAYING IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE PARTY? LO, I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A SOLUTION HERE. NOT ONLY DO WE NEED A CERTAINTY FOR DREAMERS, THE PRESIDENT GAVE US OUR FIRST OFFICIAL DEADLINE ON IMMIGRATION, THAT WAS MARCH 5TH AND WE'VE DONE NOTHING ON THE ISSUE. I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE CERTAINTY FOR DREAMERS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE BORDER SECURITY AS WELL. THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT HIS FOUR PILLARS. OUR CONFERENCE TALKED ABOUT IT. WE HAD A TWO HOUR CONFERENCE LAST WEEK. WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND MEETINGS BUT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS WILLING TO COME TO THE FLOOR. I DON'T THINK THAT REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE AFRAID TO FACE THIS IN THE ELECTION. WE OUGHT TO BE NOT ONLY FIGHTING FOR CERTAINTY FOR DREAMERS BUT WE ARE TO BE CHAMPIONING THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO SECURE OUR BORDERS. Martha: WHAT ABOUT PAUL RYAN AND WHAT ABOUT THE CHARGE THAT THIS IS TO EMBARRASS THEM, TO HUMILIATE HIM AS A LEADER BY GOING AROUND HIS BACK? IT'S NOT GOING AROUND HIS BACK. I TALKED TO THE SPEAKER ALMOST EVERY DAY AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EMPOWER THE SPEAKER TO BRING THIS UP, TO LET HIM KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE SIGNING AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SIGNING EACH DAY, BUT ULTIMATELY THE SPEAKER HAS ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THIS IS OUR DEADLINE, THE SPEAKER IS GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH THE REST OF OUR CONFERENCE TO FIND ENOUGH
