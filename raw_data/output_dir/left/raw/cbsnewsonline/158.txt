1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,268
HE IS TRYING TO GET OTHER 

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,704
PEOPLE TO GO WITH HIS STORY, GO 

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,005
WITH WHAT HE IS SAYING, WHAT HE 

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,406
DID AND WHAT HE DIDN'T DO. 

5
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:09,442
AND SO HE WAS TRYING TO GET 

6
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,543
MESSAGES TO THOSE PEOPLE. 

7
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,045
NOW, IT DOESN'T LIST WHO THOSE 

8
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,646
PEOPLE ARE IN THE DOCUMENTATION 

9
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,315
BUT IT IS BELIEVED TO BE SOME 

10
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,116
OF THE PEOPLE THAT 

11
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,417
INVESTIGATORS ALREADY KNOW 

12
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,219
ABOUT THAT WERE BROUGHT UP 

13
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,286
BEFORE IN THE CHARGES. 

14
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,420
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS -- HAS 

15
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,357
BASICALLY TWO THINGS TO SAY 

16
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:24,657
ABOUT THIS. 

17
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:25,592
ONE, THAT PAUL MANAFORT WAS 

18
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,694
BROUGHT IN AND WAS NOT INVOLVED 

19
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,797
IN THE CAMPAIGN VERY MUCH. 

20
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:32,265
PEOPLE DISPUTE THAT. 

21
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,402
>> WE TAKE YOU NOW TO THE WHITE 

22
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:37,170
HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING. 

23
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,972
THERE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS AT 

24
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,273
THE PODIUM SPEAKING TO 

25
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:40,573
REPORTERS. 

26
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:40,973
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

27
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:43,276
>> BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT'S 

28
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,812
POLICIES OF LOWER TAXES, 

29
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,882
DEREGULATION, AND FAIR AND 

30
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,282
RECIPROCAL TRADE. 

31
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:53,153
AMERICA'S ECONOMIC POTENTIAL 

32
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,054
HAS BEEN UNLEASHED. 

33
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,222
I'VE INVITED KEVIN HASSETT TO 

34
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,091
JOIN US TODAY AND OFFER MORE 

35
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,159
DETAILS ABOUT THE GROWING 

36
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,960
ECONOMY AND TAKE QUESTIONS ON 

37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,294
THIS TOPIC. 

38
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,163
AFTER THAT I WILL COME UP AND 

39
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,831
TAKE QUESTIONS OF THE NEWS OF 

40
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,331
THE DAY. 

41
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,132
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

42
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,600
AND, YOU KNOW, I WATCH THESE 

43
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,401
THINGS A LOT. 

44
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,602
AND I WAS NOTICING THAT NOT 

45
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,771
EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS IN THE BEST 

46
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:11,971
MOOD. 

47
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,907
SO I TOLD SARAH WHAT YOU GUYS 

48
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,774
NEED ARE SOME CHARTS. 

49
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,043
SO WE'VE GOT SOME CHARTS FOR 

50
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,645
YOU TODAY. 

51
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,112
I KNOW. 

52
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,246
I COULD SEE. 

53
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,015
THERE ARE A LOT OF NODDING 

54
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:22,248
PEOPLE. 

55
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,851
SO -- SO I THINK THAT SARAH 

56
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,285
SAID IT BEST. 

57
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,719
THAT WE'RE IN AS THE PRESIDENT 

58
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,188
HAS TWEETED, ONE OF THE BEST 

59
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,889
ECONOMIES I HAVE SEEN IN MY 

60
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:30,122
CAREER. 

61
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:32,492
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTS 

62
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,526
THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE 

63
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,627
LAST FEW MONTHS THAT ARE 

64
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,795
CONFIRMING SOME OF THE STUFF 

65
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,997
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST FALL 

66
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,666
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT, GOSH, IT 

67
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,701
WAS MAYBE NOVEMBER THE TAX 

68
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:42,035
BILL. 

69
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:42,902
AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT 

70
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,538
THE TAX BILL MIGHT HAVE ON THE 

71
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:45,805
ECONOMY. 

72
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,974
IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT HAS 

73
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,042
PURSUED TRADE AGENDA AND 

74
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:49,676
DEREGULATION AND WE'RE SEEING 

75
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:53,780
THE EFFECTS OF ALL OF THIS IN 

76
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,213
THE DATA. 

77
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:55,915
IN THE FIRST SLIDE IF WE CAN 

78
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,284
GET IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE 

79
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,353
WAYS OF SUMMARY OF HOW THE 

80
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,620
ECONOMY IS DOING. 

81
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,424
LOOK AT THE GPD GROWTH OVER THE 

82
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:04,791
PREVIOUS YEAR. 

83
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,858
YOU MAY RECALL WHEN PRESIDENT 

84
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,493
TRUMP RAN FOR OFFICE AND CAME 

85
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:08,928
IN AND WHEN I BEGAN OVER A YEAR 

86
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,731
AGO WE WERE ARE LOOKING AHEAD 

87
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,966
TO 3% GROWTH AND EVERYBODY SAID 

88
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,834
NO WE HAVE A NEW NORMAL, THE 

89
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,037
BLUE LINE THAT'S WE SEE DURING 

90
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,405
THE OBAMA ERA WHERE WE HAVE 

91
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,308
GROWTH IN THE ONES AND TWOS BUT 

92
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,909
WE COULD NEVER GET 3% GROWTH 

93
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:24,143
AGAIN. 

94
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,045
IN THE LATEST DATA THAT WE'VE 

95
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:31,784
GOT, WE HAVE GROWTH YEAR OVER 

96
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,119
YEAR A SMIDGE LESS THAN 3%. 

97
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:37,724
GPD WILL BE HIGH ENOUGH TO MAKE 

98
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,692
THE YEAR OVER YEAR 3.1 TO 3.2. 

99
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,160
THERE HAS BEEN A CLEAR TREND 

100
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,096
BREAK AND WE HAVE GONE FROM A 

101
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,097
NEW NORMAL OF LOW GROWTH TO 

102
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,966
JUST NORMAL, WHICH IS 3% THAT 

103
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:47,767
AMERICANS USE TODAY EXPECT. 

104
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,203
CAN I HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE, 

105
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:50,436
PLEASE. 

106
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,937
IN THIS CHART, I WANT TO SHOW 

107
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,740
SOMETHING THAT WE AGAIN TALKED 

108
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,407
ABOUT IN THE FALL. 

109
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,042
WHICH IS THAT ONE OF THE REAPS 

110
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,011
WHY WE HAD SUCH LOW GROWTH IN 

111
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,679
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IS 

112
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,248
IT WAS SO ANTIBUSINESS AND IT 

113
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,015
WAS BASICALLY DISCOURAGING 

114
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,984
CAPITAL FORMATION IN THE U.S. 

115
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,052
WITH INAPPROPRIATE TAX POLICY 

116
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:06,586
AND HIGH REGULATION. 

117
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,220
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE 

118
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,755
DATA. 

119
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:13,526
IF YOU LOOK AT, FOR EXAMPLE, 

120
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:18,464
THE BLUE DOT FROM Q12014 TO 

121
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,366
Q12015, CAPITAL SPENDING BARELY 

122
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:20,967
INCREASED AT ALL. 

123
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,470
IN PRE-ELECTION 2016 IT STAYED 

124
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,171
AT THE SAME LEVEL. 

125
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:25,904
SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER THE ELECTION 

126
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,740
WE STARTED TO SEE A BIG 

127
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,874
INCREASE IN BUSINESS SENTIMENTS 

128
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,244
AND CAPITAL SPENDING STARTED TO 

129
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,347
GO UP UP NOW THAT WE HAVE 

130
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,082
PASSED THE TAX BILL, SPENDING 

131
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,183
HAS SKY ROCKETED AND THE 

132
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,151
CAPITAL SPENDING IS ONE OF THE 

133
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,787
KEY FACTORS DRIVING GROWTH AT 

134
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,087
THIS TIME. 

135
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,722
I CAN REMEMBER WAY, WAY BACK IN 

136
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,490
THE FALL SAYING THAT IF WE PASS 

137
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,793
THE TAX BILL WE WOULD EXPECT TO 

138
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,628
SEE CAPITAL SPENDING THIS YEAR 

139
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,529
HIGHER BY 10%. 

140
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,331
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST BAR IN 

141
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,802
THE FIRST QUARTER OF GPD, 

142
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,203
CAPITAL SPEND WAS UP. 

143
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:57,670
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. 

144
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,805
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER 

145
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,673
THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. 

146
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,676
AND BELIEVE ME WE COULD GO ALL 

147
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,977
DAY BUT I PROMISED SARAH I 

148
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,211
WOULD STOP AT TEN MINUTES. 

149
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:07,814
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS MOST 

150
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,415
STRIKING BECAUSE IT HAS A BIG 

151
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,185
IMPACT ON THE OUTLOOK FOR SMALL 

152
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:12,852
BUSINESSES. 

153
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,554
RIGHT NOW SMALL BUSINESSES ARE 

154
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,221
AS OPTIMISTIC SINCE WE HAVE 

155
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,857
SEEN SINCE WE BEGAN SURVEYING 

156
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,156
THEM. 

157
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:19,224
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE -- YOU 

158
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,793
CAN SAY WELL SOMETIMES -- THE 

159
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,528
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL SAY 

160
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,963
WE SET THIS ECONOMY UP FOR THE 

161
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,263
PRESIDENT. 

162
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:27,066
YOU CAN SEE A CLEAR BREAK IN 

163
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,735
THE CHART AT THE ELECTION. 

164
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,735
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED 

165
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:32,572
THAT WOE CUT TAXES, THAT HE 

166
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,140
WOULD REDUCE TAX ON SMALL 

167
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,209
BUSINESS AND REDUCE THE HEAVY 

168
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,177
REGULATORY COSTS IMPOSED BY THE 

169
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:38,710
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. 

170
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,714
EVEN BEFORE HE BEGAN TO ACT, 

171
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,851
THE SENTIMENT TURNED AROUND. 

172
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,351
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. 

173
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,786
AND THAT'S HELPED LEAD TO 

174
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,655
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY ONE  

175
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:50,456
THE MORE REMARKABLE LABOR 

176
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,324
MARKETS WE HAVE SEEN. 

177
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,925
THE JOB MARKET IS ABOUT AS 

178
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:53,993
STRONG AS I'VE EVER SEEN. 

179
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,194
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT 

180
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,563
WAYS TO PUT IT INTO 

181
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:57,997
PERSPECTIVE. 

182
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,298
FOR ME THE EASIEST FACT IS IT 

183
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,367
IS ONLY SEVEN TIMES BACK TO 

184
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,902
1907 THAT WE'VE HAD AN 

185
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,903
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BACK TO 4%. 

186
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,205
TWO OF THE MONTHS WERE THE LAST 

187
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,006
TWO MONTHS. 

188
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,275
WE EXPECT THAT WILL CONTINUE. 

189
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,044
AS REMARKABLE AS THAT CHART IS, 

190
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,247
I THINK THE NEXT ONE IS THE ONE 

191
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,082
THAT MOVES ME EVEN MORE. 

192
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,651
THE NEXT CHART SHOWS THE GAP 

193
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,786
BETWEEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 

194
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,320
OF WHITE WORKERS AND BLACK 

195
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,587
WORKERS. 

196
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,989
AND YOU CAN SEE THE GAP IN 

197
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,825
BETWEEN THE EMPLOYMENT RATE FOR 

198
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,226
BLACK WORKERS AND WHITE WORKERS 

199
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,461
HAS GONE TO AN ALL-TIME LOW. 

200
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,062
IT IS ABOUT A THIRD WHAT IT WAS 

201
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,497
ON AVERAGE DURING THE OBAMA 

202
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:31,864
ADMINISTRATION. 

203
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,765
OF COURSE WE WANT THAT GAP TO 

204
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,000
GET ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO. 

205
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,069
WE HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS 

206
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:37,970
AMOUNT OF PROGRESS BECAUSE 

207
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,839
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WORKING TO 

208
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,706
HEAT UP THE ECONOMY. 

209
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,375
THE NEXT CHART FOR A PERSON WHO 

210
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,544
LOVES ECONOMIC DATA IS REALLY 

211
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,980
MY FAVORITE BECAUSE YOU RARELY 

212
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,948
EVER SEE ANYTHING THAT IS THE 

213
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,717
BEST SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR 

214
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:52,251
IN ECONOMIC DATA. 

215
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,687
THIS CHART SHOWS THAT THE 

216
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,755
INITIAL CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT 

217
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,323
INSURANCE WHICH IS THOSE PEOPLE 

218
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,558
THAT HAVE THE REALLY BAD NEWS 

219
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,761
THEY LOST THEIR JOB AND SHOW UP 

220
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,830
AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE TO 

221
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,964
COLLECT THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT 

222
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,099
INSURANCE IS THE LOWEST SINCE 

223
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,902
THE SECOND WORLD WAR. 

224
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:10,970
ONE OF THE MOST DISRUPTIVE 

225
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,972
THICK THAT CAN HAPPEN IS LOSING 

226
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,739
YOUR JOB. 

227
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:17,610
THERE IS NOT A BETTER ECONOMY 

228
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,312
FOR THIS THAN SINCE THE SECOND 

229
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,212
WORLD WAR. 

230
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,113
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT 

231
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:21,313
THIS. 

232
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:24,617
THIS IS JUST A CHART OF WHAT 

233
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,184
HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICANS' 

234
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,786
WEALTH SINCE THE PRESIDENT WAS 

235
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,320
ELECTED. 

236
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,921
THIS IS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE IN 

237
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,823
THEIR CHECKING ACCOUNTS, 

238
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:31,490
SECRETARIES, WHAT THE VALUE OF 

239
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,930
THEIR HOUSE IS AND THE VALUE OF 

240
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,297
EQUITY MARKETS. 

241
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,166
WEALTH HAS INCREASED BY 7 

242
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:40,566
TRILLION DOLLARS. 

243
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,934
I WOULD GUESS WHEN WE SEE THE 

244
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,769
DATA OVER THE NEXT COMING 

245
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,905
QUARTERS WE'RE GOING TO CROSS 

246
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,573
THE 100 TRILLION MARK FOR 

247
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,073
AMERICANS WEALTH. 

248
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:50,309
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE 

249
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,243
PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES 

250
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:51,610
ARE WORKING. 

251
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,380
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS 

252
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,314
THEY'RE WORKING FOR AMERICA'S 

253
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:55,581
WORKERS. 

254
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,483
THEY'RE BEING LAID OFF AT THE 

255
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,385
LOWEST MACE WE HAVE SEEN AND 

256
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,754
WAGE GROWTH IS ALSO TAKING UP 

257
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,054
AS WELL. 

258
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,324
WITH THAT, I WILL OPEN UP FOR A 

259
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:05,758
FEW QUESTIONS. 

260
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,928
I PROMISED SARAH I WOULD KEEP 

261
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,162
IT AT THREE OR FOUR. 

262
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:10,629
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 

263
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:13,398
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 

264
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:13,632
TODAY. 

265
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:17,303
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 3.8% LAST 

266
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:17,770
MONTH. 

267
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,504
BUT THE LABOR PARTICIPATION 

268
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,871
RATE STILL LAGS FOUR POINTS 

269
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:22,141
BELONG WHERE IT WAS THE LAST 

270
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,309
TIME THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WAS DOWN 

271
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,576
BELOW 4%. 

272
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,812
WHAT CAN THIS WHITE HOUSE DO TO 

273
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,848
INCREASE THE LABOR 

274
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,281
PARTICIPATION RATE? 

275
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,048
>> WELL, THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS 

276
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,384
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 

277
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,386
CAMPAIGN WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS 

278
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,820
SPEAKING TO THE FORGOTTEN 

279
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,889
PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO HAD 

280
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,257
EXITED THE LABOR FORCE BECAUSE 

281
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,759
THEY WERE SO DISCOURAGED THAT 

282
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,359
THEY HAD GIVEN UP. 

283
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,428
WE SAID WE DON'T BELIEVE THE 

284
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,063
STORY THAT WAS BEING PUSHED BY 

285
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:44,697
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 

286
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,964
THAT THERE'S NO HOPE FOR YOU. 

287
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,799
WE THINK YOU SHOULD GET BACK TO 

288
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,233
THE LABOR FORCE. 

289
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,670
AS OF -- I DID THIS CALCULATION 

290
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,472
AS OF THE LAST JOBS REPORT. 

291
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:56,609
I HAVEN'T UPDATED IT FOR THIS 

292
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:56,909
JOB REPORT. 

293
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,610
900,000 PEOPLE -- 900,000 

294
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,245
AMERICANS OUT OF THE LABOR 

295
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,415
FORCE HAVE GOTTEN A JOB SINCE 

296
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,148
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. 

297
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:09,755
SO I'LL GO BACK TO YOU, MA'AM. 

298
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,890
>> YES. 

299
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,190
THANK YOU. 

300
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,857
TWO QUESTIONS. 

301
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,859
DOES THIS ADMINISTRATION PUT 

302
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,061
INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE OBAMA 

303
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,963
ADMINISTRATION HAD -- THEY WERE 

304
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,164
DEALING WITH A RECESSION. 

305
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,131
COMING OUT OF A RECESSION. 

306
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,333
DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT 

307
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:25,037
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 

308
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,639
NUMBERS, COMPARING APPLES TO 

309
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:26,906
ORANGES? 

310
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,708
AND THEN GOING INTO BLACK 

311
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,041
UNEMPLOYMENT. 

312
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,810
THE NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN. 

313
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,444
HISTORICALLY THE NUMBERS HAVE 

314
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,446
ALWAYS BEEN ONE AND A HALF TO 

315
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,347
TWO TIMES EVEN GREATER THAN 

316
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,448
THAT OF WHITE AMERICA. 

317
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,650
WILL THIS ADMINISTRATION SINCE 

318
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,552
YOU LOVE TO TOUT THOSE NUMBERS 

319
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,155
EFFECTIVELY TARGET IN TO BRING 

320
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:43,755
THAT GAP TO -- 

321
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,391
>> SO FIRST THE GREAT 

322
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,125
RECESSION, THAT WAS THE 

323
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:46,892
TARGETING POINT OF SOMETHING 

324
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:49,395
THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING 

325
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:49,628
OBJECT. 

326
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:50,329
THE GREAT RECESSION ABSOLUTELY 

327
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,631
SLOWED GROWTH IN THE EARLY 

328
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,798
YEARS OF THE OBAMA 

329
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,165
ADMINISTRATION. 

330
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,467
NORMALLY WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE 

331
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,234
SEEN IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY 

332
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,969
AT THE END OF THE 

333
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:57,703
ADMINISTRATION THAT THE CAPITAL 

334
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,437
SPENDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE 

335
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,806
WOULD BE GETTING BACK TO 

336
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:01,039
NORMAL. 

337
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,774
AND THAT WASN'T HAPPENING. 

338
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,609
THAT WAS CLEARLY IN THE DATA. 

339
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,077
AS FOR THE TARGETING, I THINK 

340
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,679
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE 

341
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,147
SPOKE THEN THIS ROOM ABOUT 

342
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,949
BEFORE THAT THE PRESIDENT TALKS 

343
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,884
A LOT ABOUT IS INCREASING JOBS 

344
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,019
IN GOODS PRODUCING INDUSTRY, 

345
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,687
THAT IS MANUFACTURING AND 

346
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,020
CONSTRUCTION. 

347
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,621
THOSE GOODS PRODUCING 

348
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,489
INDUSTRIES ARE CREATING JOBS 

349
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,425
RIGHT NOW AT A PACE THAT IS A 

350
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,926
LITTLE UNDER 50,000 A MONTH. 

351
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,496
THAT PACES ABOUT DOUBLE WHAT IT 

352
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:23,996
WAS UNDER THE PREVIOUS 

353
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,363
ADMINISTRATION. 

354
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,831
IT IS PRECISELY THE THING THAT 

355
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,832
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

356
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,132
TARGETING. 

357
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:29,334
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RACIAL 

358
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:29,935
DISPARITIES ACROSS DIFFERENT 

359
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:33,706
PROFESSIONS, IT IS THE GOOD 

360
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,407
PRODUCING INDUSTRY THAT'S ARE 

361
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,108
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REDUCTION 

362
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,276
IN THE BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. 

363
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,111
I WILL LET YOU HAVE ONE FOLLOW-

364
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:39,345
UP. 

365
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,213
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT. 

366
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,181
WHEN IT COMES TO CONSTRUCTION, 

367
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,117
IT IS KNOWN MORE SO AS A BOOST 

368
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:45,650
FOR HISPANIC WORKERS. 

369
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,586
WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GOING 

370
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,821
TO DO TO TARGET AFRICAN-

371
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,856
AMERICANS SINCE YOU ARE TALKING 

372
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,825
ABOUT -- YOU GUYS TOUT THESE 

373
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,092
NUMBERS. 

374
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,827
>> THESE POLICIES ARE CLEARLY 

375
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:55,094
WORKING. 

376
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,329
THE GAP IS THE LOWEST IN 

377
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:57,596
HISTORY. 

378
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,097
HE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THAT. 

379
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:00,866
CAN I MOVE BACK HERE? 

380
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,668
YELLOW TIE. 

381
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,502
YES, THANK YOU. 

382
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,372
>> LET'S TURN TO TREND FOR A 

383
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:06,605
SECOND. 

384
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,841
UNITED STATES AS IT STANDS 

385
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,943
RIGHT NOW POSSIBLE TERRORISTS, 

386
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,279
CHINA HAS ITS STANCE ON 

387
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:13,712
POSSIBLE TARIFFS. 

388
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:14,613
HAVE YOU MODELED AT ALL IF 

389
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,281
THERE IS A TRADE WAR BETWEEN 

390
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,484
THE U.S. AND CHINA HOW THAT 

391
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,786
WOULD IMPACT THE U.S. ECONOMY 

392
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,221
AND AS WELL YOU'VE HAD 

393
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,689
REPUBLICANS OVER THE LAST 

394
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,890
COUPLE OF MONTHS WHO HAVE SAID 

395
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,460
THE ONE THING THAT CAN STALL 

396
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,895
TAX REFORM, THE IMPACTS ON THE 

397
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,164
ECONOMY AS THEY SEE IT IS THE 

398
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:32,964
PRESIDENT'S TRADE POLICY. 

399
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:35,333
ARE THEY ON TO SOMETHING THERE. 

400
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,335
>> LOOK THE ECONOMIC REPORT OF 

401
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,270
THE PRESIDENT THAT WE PUT OUT A 

402
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,171
FEW MONTHS AGO DOCUMENTED 

403
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,273
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT 

404
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,241
HAS TALKED ABOUT VERY 

405
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,776
EMOTIONALLY AT TIMES, GOING 

406
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:47,079
BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN THAT. 

407
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,048
OUR TRADE DEALS ARE VERY 

408
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:49,348
SYMMETRIC. 

409
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,750
THAT OUR MARKETS ARE OPEN TO 

410
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,719
IMPORTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES 

411
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,790
BUT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE 

412
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,657
ASYMMETRIC TREATMENT OF US. 

413
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:01,827
THE PRESIDENT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO 

414
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,829
GET FULLY RECIPROCAL TRADE 

415
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,163
DEALS. 

416
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,464
IF YOU MODEL A FUTURE WHERE 

417
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,565
EVERYBODY ELSE REDUCES THEIR 

418
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,300
TRADE BARRIERS TO OURS THAT, IS 

419
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,436
MASSIVELY GOOD FOR THE GLOBAL 

420
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,505
ECONOMY AND MASSIVELY GOOD FOR 

421
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,038
THE U.S. ECONOMY. 

422
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,406
THE PRESIDENT WROTE THE BOOK 

423
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:15,975
THE ART OF THE DEAL. 

424
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,843
WE'RE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS 

425
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:22,214
AND WE'RE HOPEFUL WE REACH THAT 

426
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:22,547
EQUILIBRIUM. 

427
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:23,081
>> THANK YOU, KEVIN. 

428
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,784
I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE 

429
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,152
BENEFITS OF THE TAX CUT 

430
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,087
LEGISLATION THAT THE PRESIDENT 

431
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,055
SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER. 

432
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:32,591
A MORGAN STANLEY SURVEY FOUND 

433
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,860
THAT 43% OF THE TAX CUTS 

434
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,466
SAVINGS ARE GOING TO STOP BUY 

435
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,535
BACKS AND DIVIDENDS. 

436
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:48,274
13% ARE GOING TO EMPLOYEE 

437
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,641
RAISES AND BONUSES, EMPLOYEE 

438
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:49,908
BENEFIT. 

439
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:52,044
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU 

440
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,711
ARE SEEING THAT IMPACT. 

441
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,013
THAT SO MUCH MORE SEEMS TO BE 

442
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,514
GOING TO WALL STREET THAN MAIN 

443
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:55,781
STREET. 

444
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,615
>> NOT AT ALL. 

445
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,450
IF THAT WAGE GROWTH RIGHT NOW 

446
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,254
IS THE HIGHEST -- IF YOU LOOK 

447
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,322
OVER THE LAST QUARTER THE 

448
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,491
EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX IS THE 

449
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,158
HIGHEST BACK TO 2006. 

450
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,393
THAT'S WHEN THEY CHANGED THE 

451
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,660
WAY THEY DO DATA. 

452
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,795
WE HAVE MORE THAN 6 MILLION 

453
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,863
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANNOUNCED A PAY 

454
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,131
RAISE BECAUSE OF THE TAX BILL. 

455
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,767
THE AVERAGE PAY RAISE IS NORTH 

456
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,167
OF $1,200. 

457
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,769
THE PRESIDENT SAID AGAIN AND 

458
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,837
AGAIN AND CEA SAID AGAIN AND 

459
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,705
AGAIN THAT THERE WOULD BE A 

460
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,407
$4,000 INCREASE IN PAY FOR 

461
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,475
PEOPLE IF WE PASS THE TAX BILL. 

462
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,945
AND PEOPLE SAID THAT NUMBER WAS 

463
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,079
COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE. 

464
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,813
LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 

465
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:29,782
WAL-MART HAS INCREASED THE 

466
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,951
MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE LOWEST 

467
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,018
PAID WORKERS AT WAL-MART BY $2 

468
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:33,485
AN HOUR. 

469
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,221
IF YOU RUN THAT FORWARD, THAT 

470
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,456
IS A LITTLE LESS THAN $4,000 A 

471
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:37,656
YEAR. 

472
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,559
SO IF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE AT 

473
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,594
WAL-MART ARE GETTING THE 

474
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,628
$4,000, THE PRESIDENT HAS 

475
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,896
PROMISED THEN WE'RE NOT 

476
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,564
DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAGE DATA. 

477
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,064
QUESTION OVER HERE. 

478
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:48,868
>> IT IS GOING TO WALL STREET 

479
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,735
THAN MAIN STREET. 

480
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,337
>> JUST A FOLLOW-UP ON THE 

481
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,671
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED 

482
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:53,938
EARLIER. 

483
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:54,205
TARIFFS. 

484
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:55,574
DO YOU PREDICT OWEYAND IT WAS 

485
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,209
THE TRADE QUESTION I GUESS THAT 

486
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,011
BLAKE WAS ASKING, FOLLOWING UP 

487
00:12:59,011 --> 00:12:59,411
ON. 

488
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,247
THERE IS A PREDICTION THAT 

489
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,414
INCREASE TARIFFS WILL DEPRESS 

490
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,114
THE ECONOMY. 

491
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,850
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS ENGAGED 

492
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,186
IN, DO YOU FORESEE ANY PROBLEMS 

493
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,019
WITH THE TARIFFS THAT HE HAS 

494
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,220
IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT WOULD BE 

495
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,655
YOUR REACTION TO IT. 

496
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,459
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS 

497
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,793
PUSHING OUR TRADING PARTNERS 

498
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,762
HARD TO MAKE THEIR DEALS FAIR 

499
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,530
FOR AMERICA'S WORKERS AND THAT 

500
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,234
IS HIS OBJECTIVE AND THERE ARE 

501
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:22,868
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW. 

502
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,136
I KNOW A LOT OF OTHER 

503
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:24,436
PRESIDENTS. 

504
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,138
I WAS OVER HERE AS AN OUTSIDER 

505
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,473
COMING TO TALK TO PRESIDENT 

506
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,374
OBAMA'S TEAM ABOUT THIS. 

507
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,875
A LOT OF PRESIDENTS WANTED TO 

508
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,775
MAKE BETTER DEALS AND FAILED. 

509
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,077
THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO 

510
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:32,544
FAIL AT THAT. 

511
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:35,548
HE IS GOING TO MAKE BETTER 

512
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:35,781
DEALS. 

513
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,751
>> WOULD THAT DEPRESS THE 

514
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,318
ECONOMY, HIGHER TARIFFS? 

515
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,520
DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COULD 

516
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,953
HURT THE ECONOMY. 

517
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:45,124
>> WE THINK WE WILL GET FAIR 

518
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:45,457
TRADE DEALS. 

519
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,593
>> JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT A 

520
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:49,094
LITTLE BIT. 

521
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,697
BEFORE YOU SAID -- WHAT THE 

522
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,065
PRESIDENT SAID ALSO IS THAT -- 

523
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,034
TALKING ABOUT TARIFFS WOULD BE 

524
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:59,772
MORE OF A NEGOTIATING TACTIC AS 

525
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,371
MUCH AS ANYTHING. 

526
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:08,280
HOW FAR THOUGH CAN THIS BE A 

527
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,713
NEGOTIATING TACTIC? 

528
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:09,782
OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE A 

529
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,149
TRADE BARRIER. 

530
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,584
>> I REJECT THAT IT IS A 

531
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,186
NEGOTIATING TACTIC PATIO YOU 

532
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:14,419
ARELY. 

533
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:15,154
FOR EXAMPLE, THE STEEL TARIFFS 

534
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,391
WERE PUT IN PLACE AS A NATIONAL 

535
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,125
SECURITY CONCERN. 

536
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,427
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMANDER IN 

537
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,429
CHIEF HE IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE 

538
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,930
JUDGMENTS AT A TIME OF WAR WE 

539
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,131
HAVE TO PRODUCE STEEL. 

540
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,133
THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS GOING 

541
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,203
ON IN THE 301 SPACE TO USE THE 

542
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:31,770
BASEBALL TERM. 

543
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,872
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP CHINA FROM 

544
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:34,606
DEALING OUR INTELLECTUAL 

545
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:35,907
PROPERTY AND OPEN THEIR MARKET 

546
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:36,441
TO OUR PRODUCTS. 

547
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,143
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING 

548
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:38,877
ON RIGHT NOW. 

549
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:42,514
I THINK -- LAST QUESTION, SIR. 

550
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:42,714
OKAY. 

551
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:44,049
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION 

552
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,552
WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE 

553
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,186
NAFTA NEGOTIATIONS? 

554
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,154
THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT THE 

555
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,090
UNITED STATES MIGHT WANT TO 

556
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,391
BREAK UP THE NAFTA 

557
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:52,724
NEGOTIATIONS. 

558
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,359
A DIRECT DEAL WITH MEXICO. 

559
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:55,827
IS THAT THE RIGHT APPROACH? 

560
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:57,596
>> I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT'S 

561
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,431
APPROACH IS TO NEGOTIATE WITH 

562
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,566
MEXICO AND NEGOTIATE WITH 

563
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,866
CANADA AND MAKE BETTER DEALS. 

564
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,769
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU 

565
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:09,141
WILL HAVE TO TALK TO INVESTOR 

566
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,845
LIGHTHEISER ABOUT THE CURRENT 

567
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,178
NEGOTIATIONS. 

568
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,079
>> THANKS, KEVIN. 

569
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,946
LAST ONE ADDITIONAL UPDATE. 

570
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:17,016
THE PRESIDENT AND THE 

571
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,950
ADMINISTRATION APPLAUDS SENATOR 

572
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,185
MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND 

573
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,954
HIS DECISION TO CANCEL THE 

574
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,655
MAJORITY OF THE AUGUST RECESS 

575
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:24,989
AND REMAIN IN SESSION. 

576
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,258
THERE'S BEEN HISTORIC 

577
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,960
OBSTRUCTION BY SENATE DEMOCRATS 

578
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,329
AND THERE'S A LONG TO-DO LIST, 

579
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,430
INCLUDING IMPORTANT NOMINATIONS 

580
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,131
AND APPROPRIATIONS BILL THAT'S 

581
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,233
WE HOPE THEY CAN GET TAKEN CARE 

582
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:34,399
OF. 

583
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,203
WITH THAT, I WILL TAKE YOUR 

584
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:38,570
QUESTIONS. 

585
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:38,837
JONATHAN. 

586
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,939
>> ON THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION 

587
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,142
TO DISINVITE THE EAGLES, HE IS 

588
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,710
SUGGESTING THIS IS ABOUT THE 

589
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,210
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

590
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,812
IS THE PRESIDENT AWARE THAT NOT 

591
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,147
A SINGLE PLAYER ON THE EAGLES 

592
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,849
FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON KNELT FOR 

593
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:51,383
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

594
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,519
>> THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON 

595
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,588
NOT JUST THE ANTHEM BEING CLEAR 

596
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,124
LET'S NOT FORGET THIS ISN'T -- 

597
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,827
THERE WERE 80 MEMBERS OF THE 

598
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,362
EAGLES ORGANIZATION THAT RSVP 

599
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,696
AND COMMIT TODAY ATTEND THIS 

600
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:07,166
EVENT AS RECENTLY AS FRIDAY AS 

601
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,803
WELL AS OVER A THOUSAND FANS OF 

602
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,403
THE EAGLES ORGANIZATION. 

603
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,172
AND THE EAGLES ARE THE ONES 

604
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,807
THAT TRIED TO CHANGE THEIR 

605
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,375
COMMITMENT AT THE 11th HOUR. 

606
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,409
AND THE PRESIDENT FRANKLY 

607
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,411
THINKS THAT THE FANS DESERVE 

608
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:19,878
BETTER THAN THAT. 

609
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,347
AND THEREFORE WE CHANGED THE 

610
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,550
CEREMONY TO BE A FOCUS ON 

611
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,384
CELEBRATING OUR GREAT COUNTRY. 

612
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,021
>> WHY DOES HE THINK THIS IS 

613
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:33,058
ABOUT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM? 

614
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:36,261
WE HEARD FROM STEPH CURRY AND 

615
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,029
LEBRON JAMES THAT WHOEVER WINS 

616
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,931
THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP, THEY'RE 

617
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,531
UNLIKELY TO BE HERE. 

618
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,666
IS THIS ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER 

619
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,633
THAN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

620
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,836
>> IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL 

621
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,736
STUNT BY THE EAGLES FRANCHISE, 

622
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,305
THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PLANNED 

623
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,806
TO ATTEND THE EVENT AND BACKED 

624
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,541
OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE. 

625
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,610
IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT, 

626
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,011
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 

627
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:53,912
RESCHEDULE THE VISIT WHEN THEY 

628
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,848
KNEW THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

629
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,249
GOING TO BE OVERSEAS. 

630
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,484
IF THIS WASN'T A POLITICAL 

631
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,651
STUNT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE 

632
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,853
WAITED UNTIL MONDAY, WELL AFTER 

633
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,354
A THOUSAND OF THEIR FANS HAD 

634
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,490
TRAVELED AND TAKEN TIME OUT OF 

635
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,558
THEIR SCHEDULES TO OFFER ONLY A 

636
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,594
TINY HANDFUL OF REPRESENTATIVES 

637
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,594
TO ATTEND THE EVENT. 

638
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:09,828
PAMELA. 

639
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,063
>> ON THAT POINT, THIS ISN'T 

640
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,366
ABOUT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, IT 

641
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,733
IS ABOUT SO FEW PLAYERS COMING 

642
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:16,268
IN THE END. 

643
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,636
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY 

644
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,472
CLEAR WHAT HIS POSITION IS WITH 

645
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,339
REGARDS TO THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

646
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,974
WE HAVE NEVER WAIVERRED ON 

647
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:23,175
THAT. 

648
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,343
THE PRESIDENT THINKS THAT 

649
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,146
PEOPLE SHOULD STAND FOR THE 

650
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:27,546
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

651
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,515
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO 

652
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:29,782
THE NFL. 

653
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,383
IT IS NOT ABOUT A PARTICULAR 

654
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:31,583
TEAM. 

655
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,752
IT IS ABOUT HAVING PRIDE IN OUR 

656
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,520
COUNTRY AND ABOUT BEING 

657
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,455
RESPECTFUL TO THE MEN AND WOMEN 

658
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,624
WHO HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED TO 

659
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,390
PRESERVE OUR COUNTRY. 

660
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,458
IN TERMS OF THIS, THE EAGLES 

661
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,194
ARE THE ONES THAT CHANGED THEIR 

662
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,528
COMMITMENT AT THE LAST MINUTE. 

663
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,397
THE PRESIDENT FELT IT WAS 

664
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,932
APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE THE EVENT 

665
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,033
TO BE A CEREMONY TO CELEBRATE 

666
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:49,567
OUR COUNTRY. 

667
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,636
>> JUST TO FOLLOW UP, SARAH. 

668
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:52,838
YESTERDAY ON THE STATEMENT THAT 

669
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,774
YOU MADE YOU REFERRED US TO THE 

670
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,776
OUTSIDE COUNSEL ON THE DON 

671
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,378
JUNIOR STATEMENT THAT THE 

672
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,511
PRESIDENT WAS INVOLVED IN. 

673
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,648
THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL WEIGHED IN 

674
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,883
SAYING YES THE PRESIDENT DID 

675
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,817
DICTATE THE STATEMENT. 

676
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,052
GIULIANI WAS ON CNN SAYING IT 

677
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,854
WAS A MISTAKE TO SAY THAT THE 

678
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,554
PRESIDENT DIDN'T DICTATE IT. 

679
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:10,789
DO YOU WANT TO CORRECT THE 

680
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,924
RECORD ON YOUR STATEMENT FROM 

681
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,792
AUGUST WHEN YOU SAID THAT HE 

682
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,359
CERTAINLY DIDN'T DICTATE. 

683
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,795
>> ONCE AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO 

684
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,796
GO INTO DETAIL. 

685
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,164
AND GO INTO A BACK AND FORTH. 

686
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,267
AND I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS WOULD 

687
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,870
LOVE TO ENGAGE ON MATTERS OF 

688
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,838
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE 

689
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:29,007
SPECIAL COUNSEL AND THE OUTSIDE 

690
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,976
COUNSEL BUT WE HAVE PURPOSEDLY 

691
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:31,309
WALLED OFF. 

692
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,945
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON THE 

693
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,378
OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 

694
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,412
>> YOU STILL TALKED ABOUT IT. 

695
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:35,647
WHY CAN'T YOU CORRECT THE 

696
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:35,980
RECORD NOW. 

697
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,281
>> I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER 

698
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,283
QUESTIONS THAT DEAL 

699
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,084
SPECIFICALLY WITH CONVERSATIONS 

700
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,087
BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND 

701
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:42,620
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. 

702
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,555
>> YOU WON'T ANSWER THE 

703
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:43,822
QUESTION. 

704
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,890
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO GET 

705
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,924
INTO A BACK AND FORTH WITH YOU 

706
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,695
ON THAT. 

707
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,529
I REFER TO YOU OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 

708
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,366
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WON 

709
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,400
PENNSYLVANIA BY A NARROW 

710
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,633
MARGIN. 

711
00:18:55,633 --> 00:19:02,241
HE IS LOOKING TO PICK UP A 

712
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:02,807
SENATE SEAT THERE. 

713
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,243
>> CERTAINLY WE WOULD HOPE THAT 

714
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,578
ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF 

715
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,979
PENNSYLVANIA WOULD SHARE THE 

716
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:08,814
PRESIDENT'S COMMITMENT TO THE 

717
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,781
NATIONAL ANTHEM AND THE PRIDE 

718
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,050
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY AND 

719
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,152
CERTAINLY NOT MEANT TO BE A 

720
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,320
SLIGHT TO ANYONE. 

721
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,455
BUT FRANKLY A REAFFIRMATION OF 

722
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,656
WHAT A GREAT COUNTRY THAT WE 

723
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,691
LIVE IN AND TO STAND FOR THE 

724
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,825
NATIONAL ANTHEM IS SOMETHING 

725
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,961
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 

726
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,099
VERY CLEAR ON. 

727
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,100
SARAH. 

728
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,933
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

729
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:32,204
ON THURSDAY, DARRELL STRAWBERRY 

730
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,705
WILL BE HERE. 

731
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,274
WHAT WILL BE IN THE MEETING? 

732
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,174
THE PRESIDENT SAID ANOTHER DAY 

733
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,910
THAT JAPAN, CHINA AND SOUTH 

734
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,978
KOREA CAN PROVIDE ECONOMIC 

735
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:40,678
ASSISTANCE TO NORTH KOREA. 

736
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:43,181
DOES THE PRESIDENT PLAN TO 

737
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,816
RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH THE PRIME 

738
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,083
MINISTER. 

739
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,552
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD 

740
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,421
OF THE MEETING WITH THE PRIME 

741
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,788
MINISTER BUT WE CERTAINLY 

742
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:51,690
ANTICIPATE THE SUMMIT WITH 

743
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,625
NORTH KOREA THAT WILL BE NEXT 

744
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,794
WEEK TO COME UP AS WELL AS

00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,094

WILL SPEAK TO THAT TOMORROW. 

749
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:10,409
JOSH. 

750
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,977
>> SCOTT PRUITT HELPED HIS WIFE 

751
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,044
GET A NFL FRANCHISE. 

752
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,380
DOES THE PRESIDENT THINK THAT 

753
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,014
IS AN ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. 

754
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,382
>> I HAVE NOT SPOKEN WITH THE 

755
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,151
PRESIDENT SINCE THAT REPORT 

756
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,551
CAME OUT. 

757
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,118
>> I'M ASKING ABOUT SPECIAL 

758
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:21,987
COUNSEL, OUTSIDE COUNSEL, DO 

759
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,856
YOU THINK THAT YOUR STATEMENT 

760
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,190
IS AUGUST WAS ACCURATE? 

761
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,025
YOUR STATEMENT NOT HIS 

762
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:28,960
STATEMENT. 

763
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,028
WAS YOUR STATEMENT ACCURATE. 

764
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,730
>> AGAIN I I KNOW YOU WANT TO 

765
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,130
GET INTO A BACK AND FORTH. 

766
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,467
>> NOT A BACK AND FORTH. 

767
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,069
WE WANT TO KNOW IF WAS AFFECT 

768
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,235
AT. 

769
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,705
>> YOU WANT TO ENGAGE ME ABOUT  

770
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:39,972
COUNSEL. 

771
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,139
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT TODAY. 

772
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,874
>> YOU SAID SOMETHING FROM THE 

773
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,241
PODIUM. 

774
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:43,909
WAS IT ACCURATE OR NOT? 

775
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,677
THAT'S ALL WE WANT TO KNOW. 

776
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,312
>> AGAIN, I WORKDAY IN DAY OUT 

777
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,647
AND I BELIEVE FRANKLY WITH THE 

778
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,716
MAJORITY OF YOU HERE IN THE 

779
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,718
ROOM I THINK YOU ALL KNOW I'M 

780
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,252
AN HONEST PERSON THAT WORKS 

781
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:55,520
EXTREMELY HARD TO PROVIDE YOU 

782
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,822
WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION AT 

783
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,155
ALL TIMES. 

784
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,190
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO 

785
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,791
THAT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO 

786
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,561
ENGAGE IN MATTER THAT'S HAVE TO 

787
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,294
DO WITH THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 

788
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,363
>> JUST TO FOLLOW ON THIS 

789
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,298
QUICKLY AND I THINK YOU WERE 

790
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,066
ASKED A QUESTION EARLIER. 

791
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:08,700
THE REASON THAT YOU'RE 

792
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,203
UNWILLING TO ENGAGE ON THIS 

793
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,537
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY OR 

794
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,338
ANTICIPATE YOURSELF HAVING TO 

795
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,272
TALK TO SPECIAL COUNSEL ABOUT 

796
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,373
THIS STATEMENT. 

797
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,408
>> IT IS BECAUSE THE ANNOT ARE 

798
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,642
RAT VENUE FOR THESE QUESTIONS 

799
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:19,244
TO BE ADDRESSED WOULD BE 

800
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:19,977
THROUGH THE OUTSIDE COUNSEL. 

801
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:23,614
THAT'S WHY I WOULD REFER TO YOU 

802
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:25,183
THEM TO ANSWER THEM. 

803
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:30,355
>> THE IS IT TRUE THAT PROPOSED 

804
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,891
CUTS OKAY HURRICANE SANDY FUNDS 

805
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,258
AND FUNDING. 

806
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,627
I WONDER IF WE SHOULD SEE THE 

807
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,631
TREATS AS THE ADMINISTRATION 

808
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,832
INACCURATELY COMPLETING THE 

809
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,900
FIRST, THAT MONEY WAS NO LONGER 

810
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,635
NEEDED AND THAT HAPPENED IN THE 

811
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,502
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. 

812
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,838
WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE TRUE FOR 

813
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,407
OTHER AREAS THAT THE 

814
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,875
ADMINISTRATION HAS TARGETED 

815
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,242
GOING FORWARD. 

816
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,611
>> NOT NECESSARILY BUT I WOULD 

817
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,413
REFER YOU TO OMD TO GET INTO 

818
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,315
THE DETAILS OF THAT AND WE WILL 

819
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:57,949
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

820
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,486
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS ON 

821
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,086
SPECIFICS WITH PRECISION. 

822
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:02,286
JOHN. 

823
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:04,689
>> SARAH, THE PRESIDENT TOOK A 

824
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:07,392
STICK TO HIS FAVORITE PIÑATA, 

825
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,092
JEFF SESSIONS TODAY. 

826
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:11,062
WHAT IS THE -- WHAT IS THE 

827
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:11,730
PRESIDENT'S GOAL HERE? 

828
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,797
IS IT SIMPLY TO REMIND THE 

829
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:19,337
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT HE IS 

830
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:20,805
REALLY POED AT HIM. 

831
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:26,678
IS HE TRYING TO GET HIM TO 

832
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:26,978
QUIT. 

833
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,080
>> WHAT IS HE TRYING TO DO. 

834
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,917
>> HE HAS MADE HIS POSITION 

835
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:32,317
EXTREMELY CLEAR. 

836
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,819
JUST BECAUSE YOU LAUGHED THE 

837
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,054
HARDEST AT JOHN'S JOKE I FEEL 

838
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:36,754
YOU EARNED THE RIGHT. 

839
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:38,056
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED TODAY 

840
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,425
THAT HE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE 

841
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,495
FBI WAS WEAKENING OR SLOW 

842
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,796
WALKING THE D O.J. 

843
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,399
INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLARY 

844
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,366
CLINTON E-MAIL INVESTIGATION 

845
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,268
HANDLED BY FBI DIRECTOR JAMES 

846
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:50,501
COMEY. 

847
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:54,205
WHAT IS HE BASING THAT CONCERN 

848
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:54,372
ON? 

849
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,607
IS IT BASED ON CONVERSATION 

850
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,109
THAT'S HE'S HAD WITH FBI 

851
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:58,876
PERSONNEL CURRENTLY OR SIMPLY 

852
00:22:58,876 --> 00:22:59,978
AN OBSERVATION BASED ON THE PA 

853
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:00,245
OF THE. 

854
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,480
>> LOOK, I THINK THE PRESIDENT 

855
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,082
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROCESS 

856
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:04,415
MOVE FASTER. 

857
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:06,318
THEY HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH A 

858
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,719
NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES IN WHICH 

859
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,187
THEY SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME 

860
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:09,353
ON. 

861
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:12,390
I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 

862
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,825
SOME OF THAT SPREAD OUT. 

863
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:18,630
>> DOES HE THINK IT IS 

864
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,499
APPROPRIATE TO ENCOURAGE THE TO 

865
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,366
RELEASE ON HIS TIME FRAME. 

866
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,102
>> HE WANTS IT TO BE EXPEDITED 

867
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,806
AND COMPLETED QUICKLY ON ALL 

868
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,440
FRONTS. 

869
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,673
ANDREW. 

870
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,374
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

871
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:33,745
I WANT TODAY FOLLOW UP ON 

872
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,679
JOSH'S QUESTION AND SARAH'S 

873
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,481
QUESTION BUT IN A LARGER SENSE. 

874
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,050
THE PRESIDENT, WHETHER IT IS ON 

875
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,486
HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT OR 

876
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,255
OTHERWISE KEEPS SAYING THINGS 

877
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,991
THAT ARE NOT BORNE OUT BY THE 

878
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:46,224
FACTS. 

879
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,127
WHETHER IT IS THE EAGLES THING 

880
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,928
IS ABOUT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OR 

881
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:54,900
WE GOT $6 BILLION FOR OPIOIDS 

882
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:01,306
AND GETTING RID OF THAT TAKING 

883
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,139
OVER OUR COUNTRY. 

884
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:03,808
WE HAVE A THOUSAND IMMIGRATION 

885
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:04,041
JUDGES. 

886
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:04,709
THE PRESIDENT KEEPS SAYING 

887
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,877
THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE. 

888
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,413
AND THIS THING WITH -- WITH 

889
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:08,746
DICTATING -- 

890
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:11,882
>> WHAT IS THE QUESTION? 

891
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:13,151
IF YOU COULD GET THERE. 

892
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,786
>> WHY IF THINGS THAT YOU KEEP 

893
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,154
SAYING FROM THE PODIUM TURN OUT 

894
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,957
TO NOT BE TRUE AND THINGS THAT 

895
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:24,829
THE PRESIDENT KEEPS SAYING TURN 

896
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:26,097
OUT TO NOT BE TRUE, WHY SHOULD 

897
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,866
WE BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT THE 

898
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,101
INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING 

899
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,304
FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION IS 

900
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:32,704
ACCURATE? 

901
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,372
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY 

902
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,740
SHOULD AMERICANS BE ABLE TO 

903
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,809
TRUST THAT WHAT THEY HEAR FROM 

904
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,247
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS ALWAYS THE 

905
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:42,480
TRUTH? 

906
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,148
>> ONCE AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW HOW 

907
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,617
MANY TIMES I HAVE TO ADDRESS 

908
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:45,817
THIS. 

909
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,520
BUT I WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY TO 

910
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,888
GIVE YOU ACCURATE AND UP TO 

911
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:50,321
DATE INFORMATION. 

912
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,958
AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO TO 

913
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:53,191
THAT. 

914
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,358
FRANKLY I THINK MY CREDIBILITY 

915
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,494
IS PROBABLY HIGHER THAN THE 

916
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:56,761
MEDIA'S. 

917
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,630
AND I THINK THAT IN LARGE PART 

918
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,264
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS SPEND 

919
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:02,033
MORE OF YOUR TIME FOCUSED ON 

920
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,335
ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD 

921
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:03,968
OF REPORTING THE NEWS. 

922
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,336
I THINK IF YOU SPENT A LITTLE 

923
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:06,471
MORE TIME REPORTING THE NEWS 

924
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,005
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO TEAR ME 

925
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,274
DOWN, YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY SEE 

926
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,708
THAT WE'RE WORKING HARD TRYING 

927
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,210
TO PROVIDE YOU GOOD INFORMATION 

928
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,478
AND TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT SAME 

929
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,282
GOOD INFORMATION TO THE 

930
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:17,682
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

931
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:17,949
>>> JOHN. 

932
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,249
>> SORRY. 

933
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:18,483
ANDREW. 

934
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,684
I GAVE YOU QUITE A BIT OF TIME. 

935
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,151
JOHN, GO AHEAD. 

936
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,021
>> I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION, 

937
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,456
THE ADMINISTRATION'S REACTION 

938
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,459
TO A STATEMENT PUT OUT BY A 

939
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,327
PLAYER ON THE EAGLES. 

940
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:29,727
MALCOLM JENKINS. 

941
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:32,830
HE IS A SAFETY ON THE EAGLES. 

942
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,397
RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE 

943
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:33,631
LEAGUE. 

944
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:34,699
HE PUT OUT A STATEMENT THAT HE 

945
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,871
SAID THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE 

946
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,374
BY THE PRESIDENT TO CANCEL THE 

947
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:47,746
EVENT PAINTS THE PICTURE THAT 

948
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,681
THESE PLAYERS ARE ANTIAMERICA, 

949
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:50,882
ANTI-FLAG AND ANTI-MILITARY. 

950
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,851
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO WHAT 

951
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,552
MALCOLM JENKINS PUT OUT IN A 

952
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:54,952
STATEMENT TODAY. 

953
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:56,487
>> I ADDRESSED THIS A FEW 

954
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:56,788
TIMES. 

955
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,556
AGAIN, THE EAGLES WERE THE ONES 

956
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,359
THAT COMMITTED TO AN EVENT ON 

957
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:01,592
FRIDAY. 

958
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:05,497
THEY SUBMITTED OVER 80 MEMBERS 

959
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,631
OF THE EAGLES FRANCHISE WITH 

960
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,100
THE EVENT WITH OVER A THOUSAND 

961
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,700
FANS TO PARTICIPATE. 

962
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,935
IT WAS THE EAGLES ORGANIZATION 

963
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,937
THAT TRIED TO CHANGE THEIR 

964
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,339
COMMITMENT AT THE 11th HOUR. 

965
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,909
ONCE AGAIN, IF IT WASN'T A 

966
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,677
POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY, THEY 

967
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,978
WOULDN'T HAVE PLAN TODAY ATTEND 

968
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,312
AND THEN BACKED UP. 

969
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,782
IF IT WASN'T A POLITICAL STUNT, 

970
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,883
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 

971
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,418
RESCHEDULE AN EVENT WHEN THEY 

972
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,352
KNEW THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD 

973
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,886
BE OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 

974
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:29,887
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED 

975
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:31,523
UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE TO 

976
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,091
MAKE THESE CHANGES IF THIS 

977
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,526
WASN'T ABOUT SOME TIME OF 

978
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,894
POLITICAL STATEMENT THAT THEY 

979
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,463
WERE TRYING TO MAKE TOWARDS 

980
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:38,896
THIS PRESIDENT. 

981
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:39,163
CECILIA. 

982
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:40,498
>> ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE -- 

983
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,868
THE PRESIDENT -- ARE YOU SAYING 

984
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,336
THE PRESIDENT BEARS SEE ZERO 

985
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:46,705
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS 

986
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,038
CANCELLATION? 

987
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,707
THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT CALLED 

988
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:50,575
NFL PLAYERS SOBs, WHO IMPLIED 

989
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,876
THAT SOME PLAYERS WHO DON'T 

990
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,011
STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM 

991
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,614
DO NOT BELONG IN THIS COUNTRY. 

992
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,382
DOES HE BEAR ZERO 

993
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,316
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLAYERS LIKE 

994
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,718
THE WARRIORS AND THE CAVS NOT 

995
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,921
WANTING TO COME AND THE EAGLES 

996
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:03,188
BAILING. 

997
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,288
>> THE PRESIDENT HIS POSITION 

998
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,224
HASN'T CHANGED ON THIS 

999
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,091
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. 

1000
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,225
AND THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION 

1001
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:10,729
WAS VERY CLEARLY STATED IN A 

1002
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,363
NUMBER OF FORUMS AND VENUES. 

1003
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:13,264
AND THE EAGLES MADE THE 

1004
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,699
COMMITMENT TO COME AND TO BE 

1005
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,069
PRT OF THAT EVENT WELL AFTER 

1006
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:18,836
THE PRESIDENT HAD ESTABLISHED 

1007
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:22,874
HIS FEELINGS IN REGARDS TO THE 

1008
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:23,307
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

1009
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:24,909
AND ONCE AGAIN THEY MADE THAT 

1010
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,678
CHANGE AT THE LAST MINUTE, NOT 

1011
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,178
THE PRESIDENT. 

1012
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,713
HE IS THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN 

1013
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:32,250
COMPLETELY CONSISTENT IN HIS 

1014
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,385
VIEWPOINT WHEN IT COMES TO 

1015
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:34,919
THIS. 

1016
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,721
>> THE PRESIDENT BROKE WITH 

1017
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,224
RECENT TRADITION AND DID NOT 

1018
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,291
HOST AN IFTAR DINNER. 

1019
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,360
IS HE HOSTED SUCH A DINNER THIS 

1020
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,963
YEAR AND CAN YOU TELL US HOW 

1021
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:46,830
THE INVITEEES WERE SELECTED. 

1022
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:52,270
>> HE IS HOSTING THE DINNER 

1023
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,937
TOMORROW EVENING. 

1024
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:57,308
THERE WILL BE A -- ROUGHLY 30 

1025
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,376
TO 40 DIFFERENT ATTENDEES. 

1026
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,112
I BELIEVE IT TAKES PLACE AROUND 

1027
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:01,980
8:45 TOMORROW EVENING. 

1028
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,213
BLAKE. 

1029
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:02,947
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

1030
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,683
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT TWO 

1031
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:06,417
POSSIBLE TRADE DEALS. 

1032
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,052
ONE INVOLVING THE CHINESE IN 

1033
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:09,554
WHICH IT WOULD BE $70 BILLION 

1034
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,621
OF BUYING AMERICAN PRODUCTS. 

1035
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:12,490
THE UNITED STATES WOULD BACK 

1036
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,024
OFF ITS THREAT OF TARIFFS. 

1037
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:14,592
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT 

1038
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,061
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SUPPORT. 

1039
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:20,031
>> WE'RE IN THE NEGOTIATION 

1040
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,398
PROCESS AND. 

1041
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,566
AS KEVIN SAID AND AS THE 

1042
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,169
PRESIDENT HAS STATED MANY TIMES 

1043
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,137
BEFORE, OUR FOCUS IS ON MAKING 

1044
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,072
SURE THAT WE GET GOOD DEALS. 

1045
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:29,874
HE IS GOING TO PUSH FORWARD TO 

1046
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,311
MAKE SURE THAT HE GETS THE BEST 

1047
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,513
DEAL FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. 

1048
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:36,714
JOHN. 

1049
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,549
>> LARRY SAID TODAY THAT MAYBE 

1050
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,784
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DEAL 

1051
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,686
WITH CANADA SOLELY, WITH MEXICO 

1052
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,223
SOLELY, AND THAT THE IDEA OF 

1053
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,858
NEGOTIATING NAFTA MIGHT BE GONE 

1054
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,358
AT THIS POINT. 

1055
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,994
DID THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING 

1056
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,831
TO A NAFTA DEAL DONE AS THIS 

1057
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,364
ADMINISTRATION SEES IT. 

1058
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,999
>> IT IS NOT DONE BUT AGAIN THE 

1059
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,302
PRESIDENT IS OPEN TO HAVING 

1060
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:57,735
INDIVIDUAL DEALS. 

1061
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,204
BUT HE IS LOOKING AT THE BEST 

1062
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,072
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT HE GETS 

1063
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,407
THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE FOR 

1064
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:07,178
AMERICAN WORKERS AND WHETHER OR 

1065
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:07,778
NOT THAT'S THROUGH NAFTA OR 

1066
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,081
OTHER MEANS, THAT IS ON THE 

1067
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,448
TABLE. 

1068
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:10,715
>>> JOHN. 

1069
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:11,315
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

1070
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:22,794
BACK TO THE ISSUE OF 

1071
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,829
PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS. 

1072
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,868
THERE'S BEEN CONSIDERABLE 

1073
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:35,073
CONSIDERABLE AND ALLIES IN 

1074
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,876
CONGRESS ABOUT HIM EVEN 

1075
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:44,015
SUGGESTING THE SENTENCE OF ROD 

1076
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:44,348
BLAGOJEVICH. 

1077
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:45,116
MANY ARE COMING INCREASINGLY 

1078
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:45,416
OUTSPOKEN. 

1079
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:49,554
IS HE GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH 

1080
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,256
THE COMMUNE OR IS HE BACKING 

1081
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,458
DOWN AND IS HE AWARE OF THE 

1082
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,592
CRITICISM FROM SUPPORTERS OF 

1083
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:54,792
HIS. 

1084
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,461
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT MADE A 

1085
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,996
FINAL DECISION BUT AS YOU KNOW 

1086
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,330
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T BASE HIS 

1087
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,498
DECISIONS OFF OF THE CRITICISM 

1088
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,799
OF OTHERS BUT ON WHAT HE THINKS 

1089
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,534
IS THE RIGHT DECISION TO MAKE. 

1090
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:06,136
THAT'S WHAT HE WILL BASE IT ON. 

1091
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:06,337
DAVE. 

1092
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,006
>> SARAH, THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO 

1093
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,307
MEETING WITH LAWMAKERS HERE 

1094
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,575
THIS AFTERNOON. 

1095
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,208
WHAT IS ON THE AGENDA? 

1096
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:13,578
>> A NUMBER OF ITEMS WILL BE 

1097
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,245
DISCUSSED AT THAT EVENT. 

1098
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,649
AND WE WILL BE SURE TO PROVIDE 

1099
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,449
INFO AFTERWARDS. 

1100
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:18,682
HUNTER. 

1101
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:19,183
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. 

1102
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:20,151
DOES THE PRESIDENT STILL THINK 

1103
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,220
HIS RESPONSE TO THE HURRICANE 

1104
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,621
IN PUERTO RICO DESERVES A TEN 

1105
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,923
OUT OF TEN SCORE NOW THAT 

1106
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:27,625
ESTIMATES SAY THAT ALMOST 5,000 

1107
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,959
PEOPLE DIED THERE? 

1108
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:30,328
>> THE FEDERAL RESPONSE ONCE 

1109
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,063
AGAIN WAS AT A HISTORIC 

1110
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:32,363
PROPORTION. 

1111
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,131
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH 

1112
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,431
THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO AND 

1113
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:37,635
DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN TO 

1114
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,803
PROVIDE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE, 

1115
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,238
PARTICULARLY WORKING WITH THE 

1116
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,105
GOVERNOR THERE IN PUERTO RICO. 

1117
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:44,174
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. 

1118
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:45,443
>> ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE 

1119
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,645
MASSIVE VOLUME OF THE DEATH 

1120
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:47,978
TOLL THERE? 

1121
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:49,814
>> THE ADMINISTRATION CAME OUT 

1122
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,417
IN SUPPORT OF THE BAKERS 

1123
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,586
FREEDOMOF EXPRESSION IN THE 

1124
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:56,387
SUPREME COURT CASE. 

1125
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,389
WHY ARE ATHLETES RIGHTS TO 

1126
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,990
EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 

1127
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,292
>> WITH WHETHER IT COMES TO THE 

1128
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,163
BAKERS WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE 

1129
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:05,430
DECISION. 

1130
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,132
IT PREVENTS THE GOVERNMENT 

1131
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:08,866
DISCRIMINATING ON RELIGIOUS 

1132
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:09,133
BELIEFS. 

1133
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,568
AND THEY FOUND THAT THE 

1134
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,636
COMMISSION FAIL TODAY SHOW 

1135
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,538
TOLERANCE AND RESPECT FOR HIS 

1136
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,172
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. 

1137
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,007
IN THIS CASE AND OTHERS THE 

1138
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,709
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL 

1139
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,378
CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND 

1140
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,212
THE FREE SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS 

1141
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,080
FREEDOM FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. 

1142
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,949
>> I GUESS MY QUESTION IS 

1143
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:25,483
SIMPLE. 

1144
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,218
IF THE WHITE HOUSE SUPPORTS THE 

1145
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,853
BAKER'S RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH, 

1146
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,356
WHY DOESN'T THE WHITE HOUSE 

1147
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,224
SUPPORT THE PLAYERS RIGHT TO 

1148
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:33,691
FLEE SPEECH. 

1149
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,792
>> THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T THINK 

1150
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,662
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF FREE 

1151
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:37,895
SPEECH. 

1152
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:38,796
HE THINKS IT IS ABOUT 

1153
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,332
RESPECTING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF 

1154
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,933
OUR MILITARY. 

1155
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:45,369
IT IS ABOUT RESPECTING OUR 

1156
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:46,938
NATIONAL ANTHEM AND STANDING IN 

1157
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,673
PRIDE FOR THEM. 

1158
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,675
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 

1159
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,076
>> WILL HE -- WILL THE 

1160
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,411
PRESIDENT -- IF IT IS ABOUT 

1161
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,013
FREE SPEECH AND HE SUPPORTS 

1162
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:55,346
THESE IDEAS. 

1163
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,516
WILL HE COMMIT TO A ROUND TABLE 

1164
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,817
WITH AMERICA'S ATHLETES ON 

1165
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,485
TOPICS OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE. 

1166
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:03,454
>> I WOULD CERTAINLY BE HAPPY 

1167
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:03,855
TO ASK HIM. 

1168
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,424
>> HAS HE -- IS IT NOT 

1169
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,259
SOMETHING THAT HAS HAD ANY 

1170
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,761
DISCUSSION TO THIS POINT GIVEN 

1171
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,362
THE DIVISION IN THE COUNTRY 

1172
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:11,895
OVER SOCIAL INJUSTICE. 

1173
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:15,066
>> WE LOOK AT WAYS EVERY SINGLE 

1174
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,467
WAY TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY. 

1175
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,302
THE PRESIDENT HAS WORKED 

1176
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,637
ACTIVELY AND TIRELESSLY TO BE 

1177
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:20,705
THE PRESIDENT OF ALL AMERICANS. 

1178
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,206
I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT 

1179
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,641
REFLECTED IN THE POLICIES THAT 

1180
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,543
HE HAS PUT FORTH. 

1181
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,446
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST 

1182
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,148
THINGS COME OUT OF THIS 

1183
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,383
ADMINISTRATION FRANKLY THAT IS 

1184
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:36,287
FAR AND VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN 

1185
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,288
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS IS 

1186
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,023
PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL 

1187
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:39,323
AMERICANS. 

1188
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:40,591
PROVIDE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 

1189
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,893
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS WORKED 

1190
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,561
INCREASINGLY HARD TO MAKE SURE 

1191
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,294
THAT HAPPENS. 

1192
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:45,429
KEVIN SPOKE ABOUT THAT EARLIER. 

1193
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:48,099
HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO 

1194
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:48,633
THAT. 

1195
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,701
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 

1196
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:51,969
>>> STEVEN. 

1197
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:52,837
>> IS THE PRESIDENT -- 

1198
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:53,137
>> SORRY. 

1199
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:53,737
STEVEN GO AHEAD. 

1200
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,506
>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT 

1201
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,041
DISRESPECTING THE FLAG. 

1202
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:57,741
IS THE PRESIDENT AWARE OF. 

1203
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:59,911
>> I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO TO 

1204
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,014
STEVEN BUT I'M ASKING, THERE IS 

1205
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:03,981
AN UNDERLYING ISSUE AND IT 

1206
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,917
GROWS ABOUT DISRESPECT OF THE 

1207
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:06,450
FLAG AND SOLDIERS. 

1208
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,585
THERE ARE BLACK AND BROWN 

1209
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,519
SOLDIERS THAT FIGHT IN THE 

1210
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,854
MILITARY AS WELL THAT FEEL 

1211
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,889
TAKING THE KNEE, BRINGING THE 

1212
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,157
ATTENTION TO POLICE INVOLVED 

1213
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,058
SHOOTINGS IS SOMETHING THAT THE 

1214
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,160
WHITE HOUSE SHOULD DEAL WITH. 

1215
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,628
IS THE PRESIDENT AWARE THAT 

1216
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,564
TAKING THE KNEE IS ABOUT POLICE 

1217
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,097
INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. 

1218
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:21,732
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 

1219
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,101
POSITION CRYSTAL CLEAR. 

1220
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,336
AND THAT IT IS -- I LET YOU 

1221
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,305
RUDELY INTERRUPT ME AND YOUR 

1222
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:27,605
COLLEAGUE. 

1223
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:27,972
>> I'M SORRY. 

1224
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,974
>> I'M GOING TO ASK THAT YOU 

1225
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,609
ALLOW ME TO FINISH MY ANSWER. 

1226
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,844
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT 

1227
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,078
IF YOU STOP TALKING LONG ENOUGH 

1228
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,479
TO LET ME DO THAT. 

1229
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:37,215
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 

1230
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,784
POSITION CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THIS 

1231
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:40,017
TOPIC. 

1232
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,152
HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT STANDING 

1233
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,920
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS 

1234
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,087
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO. 

1235
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:45,523
SOMETHING THAT MATTERS TO WHAT 

1236
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,758
MAKES OUR COUNTRY SPECIAL AND 

1237
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:49,526
UNIQUE AND WHAT SETS US APART. 

1238
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:51,028
HE'S NOT GOING TO WAIVER ON 

1239
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:51,395
THAT. 

1240
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:53,397
HE IS NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE 

1241
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:53,698
FOR IT. 

1242
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,433
AND FRANKLY MORE THAN 70% OF 

1243
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,868
AMERICANS AGREE WITH HIM ON 

1244
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,235
THAT MATTER. 

1245
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,870
IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT THE 

1246
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,605
ORIGIN TENT WAS, THIS HAS BEEN 

1247
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,772
MADE A POLITICAL ARGUMENT OF 

1248
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:02,540
WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS NOT 

1249
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,008
GOING TO BACK DOWN FROM AND HE 

1250
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,211
HAS BEEN CLEAR ON IT. 

1251
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,312
STEVEN, LAST QUESTION.

FRUIT. 

1272
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:35,406
THE TWO WHO REPRESENT IOWA HAVE 

1273
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,440
HAD IT. 

1274
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,974

EARN SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 

1277
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,612
AS SWAMPY AS YOU CAN GET. 

1278
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:43,848
NEW ELEMENTS OF HOW SWAMPY THAT 

1279
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,014
IS. 

1280
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:46,016
HOW IS IT IN THE FACE OF ALL 

1281
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:48,886
THAT WE HAVE LEARNED, HOW IS 

1282
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:49,887

1361
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,215
BOTH OF THEM ARE BEING HONEST. 

1362
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,850
SARAH SANDERS HAD TO DEFEND 

1363
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,918
HERSELF ON MISLEADING 

1364
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,353

1365
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,287
PRESIDENT'S ROLE ABOUT A 

1366
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,354
MISLEADING STATEMENT ABOUT HIS 

1367
00:37:04,354 --> 00:37:06,223

1368

MEETING AT TRUMP TOWER WITH A 

1369
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:08,592
GROUP OF RUSSIANS. 

1370
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:12,563
NOW, WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE 

1371
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,364
PRESIDENT'S SPECIAL COUNSEL 

1372
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,399
ATTORNEYS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1373
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,701
ACTUALLY DICTATED THAT 

1374
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,001
STATEMENT. 

1375
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,636
SO TODAY SARAH SANDERS FACED A 

1376
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,938
LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY SHE 

1377
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,841
MISLEAD REPORTS AND THE PUBLIC 

1378
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,309
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE. 

1379
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,445
SHE REPEATEDLY DEFLECTED AND 

1380
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:32,083
REFERRED TO OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND 

1381
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,019
ACCUSED REPORTERS OF ENGAGING 

1382
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,353
HER IN A DIALOGUE. 

1383
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:37,655
THERE WERE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 

1384
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,488
HER AND GOING FORWARD. 

1385
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:40,558
>> WE HAVE A LIVE LOOK AT THE 

1386
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,091

1389
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,763
YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IT WAS JOHN 

1390
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,864
ROBERTS FROM FOX NEWS WHO ASKED 

1391
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,566
A QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT 

1392
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,434
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT 

1393
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,838
TOOK A STICK WAS HIS WORDS TO 

1394
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,773
HIS FAVORITE PIÑATA JEFF 

1395
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,040
SESSIONS. 

1396
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,075
WHY DOES THE PRESIDENT KEEP 

1397
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,476
BRINGING HIM UP. 

1398
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,578
>> IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 

1399
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:03,714
PEOPLE THINK THAT HE IS FORCING 

1400
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,015
HIM TO RESIGN BECAUSE LEGALLY 

1401
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:06,550
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T FIRE THE 

1402
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,183
ATTORNEY GENERAL. 

1403
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:08,919
LEGALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE 

1404
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,320
RUSSIA PROBE IS LOOKING INTO 

1405
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,054
POSSIBLE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 

1406
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,990
BY THE PRESIDENT AND PEOPLE IN 

1407
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,125
THE INNER CIRCLE THE OPTICS WON 

1408
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,227
BE GREAT IF HE WAS TO FIRED HIS 

1409
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,796
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HE HAS 

1410
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,797
REPEATEDLY PUBLICLY CRITICIZED 

1411
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,133
FOR RECUSING HIMSELF IN THE 

1412
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:22,500
RUSSIA PROBE. 

1413
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,501
POLITICALLY WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 

1414
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,935

SPECIFICALLY RELATE TODAY 

1418
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:30,874
IMMIGRATION. 

1419
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:32,042
LEGALLY AND POLITICALLY HE 

1420
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,611
CAN'T FIRE HIS ATTORNEY 

1421
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,178
GENERAL. 

1422
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,112
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THESE 

1423
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:35,913
TAUNTS, TWEETS, INSULTS ARE 

1424
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,581
PART OF AN EFFORT TO FORCE HIM 

1425
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:37,948
TO RESIGN. 

1426
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:38,916

HE IS COMFORTABLE IN HIS JOB. 

1430
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,587
HE IS AT THIS POINT NOT REALLY 

1431
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,856
PHASED BY ANY OF THE INSULTS 

1432
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:46,824
AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORKDAY IN

00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,033
HE CAN UNILATERALLY IMPLEMENT 

1438
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:56,766

1439
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:57,968
