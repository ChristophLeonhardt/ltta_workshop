1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,160
- Narrator: More than 1,000 North Koreans

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,490
try to escape the country every year.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,730
They risk being killed,
imprisoned, or trafficked,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,150
as they escape through China, Mongolia,

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,730
and different regions of southeast Asia.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,190
This is Yeon Mi Park.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,900
She escaped North Korea when
she was just 13 years old,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,240
and she described her ordeal to us.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,290
- I think, just life was so
unbearable in North Korea.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,747
I found this note that my
sister left, saying that,

11
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:31,570
"Go find this person, and she
will help you to go to China."

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,710
We got that note, and my mother and I

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,080
found the person, that lady.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,070
And then she told me that
she had a few daughters,

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,590
but she sent them all to China,

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,460
and told me she could
help us to go to China.

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,730
And we did not know that she was a broker,

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,117
or anything, just we thought,

19
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:52,190
"This stranger woman wants to help us,"

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,400
and that's how we just followed her lead

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,280
and we escaped at night,
the very same day.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,550
Initially, I escaped to China,

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,600
and I was being sold and trafficked

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,500
and enslaved for two years there.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,023
- Narrator: Park wasn't alone.

26
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:10,080
Around 70% of North Korean
defectors are women,

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,100
and many of them are targeted to be sold

28
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,810
as brides or trafficked.

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,870
Defectors are considered
illegal migrant workers,

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,510
and are sent back to North Korea

31
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,900
to face punishment if caught.

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,130
- My mother and myself

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,210
We crossed the Gobi Desert to Mongolia.

34
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,900
And, from Mongolia, we
were there a few months,

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,190
and then we flew to South Korea.

36
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,690
I think that when I was
crossing the Gobi Desert,

37
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,690
in minus 40 degrees at night
in 2009, I was 15 by then.

38
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,480
I think wasn't scared of dying

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,627
in that desert, I just thought,

40
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,100
"Even this universe abandoned me."

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,610
Like, I was punished that
I was born in North Korea.

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,930
My crime was as simple as that,

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,100
that I was born on the
wrong side of the river.

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,953
- Narrator: She and her
mother finally arrived 

45
00:01:56,962 --> 00:02:00,520
in South Korea two years later in 2009.

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,840
Once a North Korean defector
makes it to South Korea,

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,220
they're granted citizenship

48
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,990
under the South Korean Nationality Law,

49
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,889
which states that any person
born on the Korean Peninsula

50
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,909
is eligible to be a South
Korean citizen, but first,

51
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,620
they have to go through
a lengthy screening

52
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,130
and reeducation process.

53
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,090
Once cleared, defectors enter

54
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,640
the Settlement Support Center
for North Korean Refugees,

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,560
commonly called Hanawon.

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,332
- They put us into a place
called Hanawon Resettlement.

57
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,040
Every thinks that once you escape,

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,522
once you arrive in the land of freedom,

59
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:40,650
people think that's the end of the story,

60
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,060
everyone is fine and
happy, but that's not it.

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,500
- Narrator: Defectors
spend up to three months

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,100
learning the history of
the Korean Peninsula,

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,510
along with basic life skills

64
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,430
like how to use an ATM,
and shop for groceries.

65
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,930
Many defectors are drastically
behind in education,

66
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,530
as North Korea emphasizes propaganda

67
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,920
over skills like reading and math.

68
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,050
It can be difficult for Hanawon officials

69
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,050
to address the needs of the defectors,

70
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,270
due to the lack of
information about North Korea.

71
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,070
Defectors can be unprepared

72
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,000
for things Hanawon doesn't teach,

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,830
such as understanding South Korea's

74
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,130
ultra-competitive social structure.

75
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,760
- Do you know how South Korean kids

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,730
like working the entire night?

77
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,240
They have these specific tutors,

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,740
all this unbelievable
culture of education,

79
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,210
that they spend all their life
to go to these universities,

80
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,540
and study English or that,

81
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,990
that you can not ever catch up with them.

82
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,810
- Narrator: Additionally, social disparity

83
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,240
and political tensions
can lead to defectors

84
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,810
facing discrimination from South Koreans.

85
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,410
- I'm not welcome.

86
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,180
I am a second-class citizen here.

87
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,600
So, that was really tiring in South Korea,

88
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,687
because people never said
any positive things about me,

89
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:57,400
coming from North Korea
and being a defector,

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,740
because that was a stigma,

91
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,680
that people just are so hard on you,

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,010
even criticize, and traumatize us

93
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,620
for what we've gone through
or where we are from.

94
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,530
That's how hard it was as a defector,

95
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,730
and really, really, sadly,

96
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,790
there has been some people, actually,

97
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,240
who even went back to North
Korea from South Korea.

98
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,407
At some point, it was so
overwhelming that I was thinking,

99
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:27,577
"Just give me enough frozen potatoes"

100
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:29,420
"I'm just gonna go back to North Korea."

101
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,260
- Narrator: Defectors can
face a life of medical issues

102
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,360
caused by malnutrition
earlier in their lives.

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,890
They're also at higher risk

104
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,060
of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.

105
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,510
The suicide rate among North
Korean defectors in South Korea

106
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,500
is three times higher than South Koreans,

107
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,653
and I think South Korea

108
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:52,030
is one of the most
high-suicide-rate countries.

109
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,330
- Narrator: Another challenge?

110
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,600
Understanding freedom
and victory it brings.

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,720
- To me, freedom was wearing jeans,

112
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,323
or watching movies, or
listening to hip-hop songs.

113
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,900
And, that's how simple it was.

114
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,580
Maybe wearing earrings,

115
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,100
because in North Korea we
don't have any freedom.

116
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,830
They tell us what to wear,
what to listen, what to watch.

117
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,700
In South Korea, for
instance, if you go shop,

118
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,140
there are so many tons of kinds of pants.

119
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,490
You gotta choose what you want to wear.

120
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,070
That's very simple, even
that was overwhelming for me.

121
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,680
But, I am very grateful that
I was born in North Korea,

122
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,404
today, because I'm the winner.

123
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:33,060
I survived, I fought for my freedom.

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,010
It was not given to me,
but I fought for it.

125
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,350
So, I want the

126
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,040
North Korean defectors
struggling in South Korea,

127
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,320
that you should be very proud of yourself,

128
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,010
and don't listen to anyone
say that you are not enough,

129
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,810
that you are different,
you are not going to win.

130
00:05:48,810 --> 00:00:00,000
You are the winner already.
