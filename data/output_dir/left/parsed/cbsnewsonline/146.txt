ROSFELD WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED 
WITH CRIMINAL HOPS -- HOMICIDE. 
THE QUESTION AS THERE HAVE BEEN 
PROTESTS HAPPENING THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS SINCE THE 
SHOOTING OCCURRED IS WHAT 
HAPPENED, WHY DID THE OFFICER 
FIRE ON A YOUNG MAN RUNNING 
AWAY? 
>> WE SHOULD REMIND PEOPLE THAT 
PART OF THE REASON WE KNOW HE 
WAS RUNNING AWAY WAS A NEIGHBOR 
VIDEOTAPED IT USING HER PHONE 
OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. 
IN FACT THE POLICE OFFICERS DID 
NOT HAVE CAMERAS ON THEM OR DID 
NOT HAVE THE CAMERAS ON. 
I AM SURE WE WILL GET MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE DA 
KNOWS. 
>> SHE WAS HEARD ON THE VIDEO 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SAYING 
WHY ARE THEY SHOOTING HIM 
BECAUSE HE WAS RUNNING AWAY? 
FOR ANYBODY WHO SAW THE VIDEO 
THEY PROBABLY HAD THE SAME 
QUESTION. 
IT HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF DAYS 
AND HE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. 
YOU COULD HEAR THERE AND DON'T 
KNOW IF THAT WAS THE 
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE MAYOR OR 
THE SPOKESPERSON FOR THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT SAYING BASICALLY 
LAMBASTING THE MEDIA FOR THE 
COVERAGE. BUT THE COVERAGE AND 
THE PROTESTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
HAPPENING THE LAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS IS MOST LIKELY WHAT GOT 
THE ATTENTION OF THE DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY. 
>> WHEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
GETS UP THERE WE WILL HEAD BACK 
LIVE TO GET INFORMATION. 
I'M ANNE-MARIE GREEN. 
>> I AM VLAD DUTHIER. 
WE BEGIN THE HOURS WITH THE 
STUNNING DEFEAT AHEAD OF THIS 
YEAR'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
THIS WOMAN ,  28-YEAR-OLD 
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ  
DEFEATED 10 TERM CONGRESSMAN IN 
NEW YORK AND HER REACTION, 
CHECK IT OUT. 
SHE HAD HER MOUTH COVERED AND 
COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. 
A FORMER BERNIE SANDERS 
ORGANIZER WHO RECENTLY -- IT'S 
A WONDERFUL STORY NO MATTER 
WHERE YOU SIT ON THE POLITICAL 
DIVIDE TO SEE SOMEONE SO YOUNG 
AND INTERESTED IN CIVICS AND 
MAKE IN THIS COUNTRY A BETTER 
PLACE DECIDING TO RUN FOR 
OFFICE AT AGE 28. 
IN NOVEMBER SHE WAS A 
BARTENDER. 
>> SHE DEFEATED THE NUMBER 4 
HOUSE DEMOCRAT WHO IS 
CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL 
SUCCESSOR TO NANCY PELOSI. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ SPOKE ABOUT 
WINNING HER FIRST-EVER RACE FOR 
OFFICE EARLIER ON CBS THIS 
MORNING. 
>> IT WAS SO SHOCKING. 
WE FELT SO GREAT ALL DAY BUT TO 
SEE WHAT THAT FEELING LOOKED 
LIKE IN NUMBERS WAS REALLY 
ASTONISHING. 
>> DID YOU THINK YOU HAD A REAL 
SHOT AT WINNING? 
>> I ALWAYS FELT LIKE WE HAD A 
SHOT AND WE HAD THE POSSIBILITY 
TO WIN, ALWAYS, FROM DAY ONE. 
>> TO HELP BREAK DOWN THE RACE 
WERE JOINED BY NANCY PORTIS ON 
CAPITOL HILL AND POLITICAL 
CONTRIBUTOR MICHAEL GRAHAM WHO 
IS THE EDITOR FOR NH 
JOURNAL.COM AND A BOSTON HERALD 
COMMUNIST -- COLUMNIST. 
>> CROWLEY IS THE FIRST 
CONGRESSIONAL LEADER TO FALL IN 
A PARTY PRIMARY SINCE 
REPUBLICAN HOUSE MAJORITY 
LEADER ERIC CANTOR LOST TO A 
TEA PARTY CHALLENGER IN THE 
2014 MIDTERM ELECTION. 
WHAT WENT WRONG FOR JOE 
CROWLEY? 
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS. 
FIRST OF ALL HE IS SOMEONE WHO 
HAS NOT FACED A PRIMARY 
CHALLENGE SINCE 2004, SO HAD 
PROBABLY GOTTEN A LITTLE OUT OF 
PRACTICE. 
IN A WAY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM 
AS SIMILAR IN WHAT HAPPENED TO 
ERIC CANTOR IS THEY ARE BOTH 
LEADERS IN THE PARTY AND VERY 
FOCUSED ON WHAT IS GOING ON 
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL. 
INTERPARTY POLITICS, IN HIS 
CASE EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE HE 
WAS WORKING TO CEMENT SUPPORT 
FOR A POSSIBLE RUN FOR 
DEMOCRATIC LEADER AT SOME POINT 
IF NANCY PELOSI WERE TO STEP 
AWAY. 
IT MAY BE HE SIMPLY TOOK HIS 
EYE OFF THE BALL IN HIS HOME 
DISTRICT WHICH ENCOMPASSES PART 
OF THE BRONX AND QUEENS. 
IN HIS OPPONENT, YOU HAD A 
YOUNG, FRESH FACE AND SOMEONE 
VERY CHARISMATIC WHO BURST ON 
THE SCENE AND ARGUED SHE BETTER 
REPRESENTED THE POLITICS OF THE 
DISTRICT AND THE MAKEUP OF THE 
DISTRICT. 
IT IS 70% MINORITY IN THE 14th 
DISTRICT AND SHE MADE THE CASE 
THAT HER OPPONENT WHO IS TWICE 
HER AGE AND SPENDS A LOT MORE 
TIME IN WASHINGTON HAD GROWN 
APART FROM THE DISTRICT AND SHE 
BETTER UNDERSTOOD THE PEOPLE 
THAT SHEWAS SEEKING TO 
REPRESENT. 
OBVIOUSLY THAT RESONATED, 
BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT EVEN A 
CLOSE CALL. 
SHE WALKED AWAY WITH THE WIN 
DESPITE BEING OUTSPENT BY 
SOMETHING LIKE 18 TO 1. 
>> YOU MENTIONED HE WAS OUT OF 
PRACTICE IN TERMS OF RUNNING. 
DIDN'T HE SKIP A DEBATE 
ALTOGETHER AND SENT A STAND-IN? 
>> HE SKIPPED A COUPLE OF 
DEBATES AND THAT IS RIGHT. 
HE SENT A SURROGATE TO ONE OF 
THE DEBATES WHICH DID NOT SIT 
WELL AND IN FACT THE NEW YORK 
TIMES WHICH IS THE HOMETOWN 
PAPER OBVIOUSLY IN HIS DISTRICT 
ACTUALLY PRINTED AN EDITORIAL 
AND SAID WHAT ARE WE, CHOPPED 
LIVER? 
YOU BETTER WORRY, CONGRESSMAN 
CROWLEY, YOU ARE SENDING A 
MESSAGE TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN 
NEW YORK YOU DON'T HAVE TIME 
FOR THEM BECAUSE YOU ARE SO 
BUSY WITH POLITICS DOWN IN 
WASHINGTON. 
HE DID EVENTUALLY SHOW UP FOR A 
DEBATE WITH OCASIO-CORTEZ, BUT 
BY THAT POINT IT MAY HAVE BEEN 
TOO LATE. 
THERE WERE SIGNS IN THE LAST 
FEW WEEKS OF THE RACE HE WOKE 
UP TO THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY 
WAS SHE GETTING A LOT OF 
ATTENTION IN THE NATIONAL 
PRESS, BUT SHE WAS MAKING 
INROADS IN THE DISTRICT. BY 
THAT POINT, SHE HAD CLEARLY 
CEMENTED HER SUPPORT AND FELT 
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH THAT SHE 
EVEN WENT TO TEXAS OVER THE 
FINAL WEEKEND OF HER CAMPAIGN 
TO PROTEST OUTSIDE A DETENTION 
FACILITY ABOUT FAMILIES BEING 
SEPARATED. 
SHE WASN'T EVEN IN NEW YORK 
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT. 
SHE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORTERS 
DOING SO THAT SHE WAS DOWN IN 
TEXAS TWEETING FROM THE BORDER. 
>> SUCH A FASCINATING STORY AND 
SURPRISED WHEN SHE LEFT THE 
DISTRICT TO GO TO THE BORDER TO 
PROTEST WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO 
SEPARATED FAMILIES. 
SHE EVEN CALLED I.C.E. 
A FASCIST ORGANIZATION. 
CROWLEY TRIED TO RIDE THE 
COATTAILS. 
>> BACK TO PITTSBURGH WHERE WE 
GET AN UPDATE ON THE CHARGES 
AGAINST THE POLICE OFFICER 
ACCUSED OF SHOOTING AND KILLING 
ANTWON ROSE. 
>>> DO YOU HAVE THE AFFIDAVIT? 
I CAN GO THROUGH THE RECITATION 
OF SOME FACTS IN THE AFFIDAVIT. 
JUNE 19 OF THIS YEAR AT 8:20 7 
P.M.  
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS 
DISPATCHED TO THE CORNER OF 
JONES AND BALDRIDGE STREETS. 
911 INDICATED SHOTS FIRED. 
THE AREA IS A CONCERN TO THE 
POLICE FOR OTHER CRIMES THERE 
INCLUDING MAJOR CRIMES. 
SIX COMMUNITIES THAT SURROUND 
THIS BOROUGH HAVE A MUTUAL AID 
AGREEMENT WHICH MEANS WHEN 
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS IN THAT 
COMMUNITY, THEN THE OTHER SIX 
COMMUNITIES WILL SUPPORT THAT 
POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
AT 8:29 A WITNESS TELLS THE 
POLICE THAT SHOTS ARE FIRED BY 
A PASSENGER IN A CAR. 
THEY WERE FIRED AT PARTICULAR 
PERSONS. 
911 FURTHER DESCRIBES THE 
VEHICLE, THE DESCRIPTION OF THE 
VEHICLE IS WRONG. 
THEY DESCRIBE IT AS A GOLD 
MERCURY. 
THEY ALSO DESCRIBE THE DIRECTION
OF THE VEHICLE LEAVING THE 
AREA. 
AT 8:30, A WHITE MALE VICTIM IS 
IDENTIFIED. 911 INDICATES 
GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE ABDOMEN. 
ULTIMATELY IT IS DETERMINED 
THERE IS A GRAZING WOUND ACROSS 
THE STOMACH. 
THAT MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A 
BULLET OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO A 
FRAGMENT FROM A BUILDING. 
THESE MATTERS OBVIOUSLY, 
EVIDENCE CONTINUES TO BE 
DEVELOPED. 
AS MORE EVIDENCE IS DEVELOPED, 
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE VEHICLE 
BECOMES A LIGHT GOLD CHEVY CRUZ
. THE SCENE IS SECURED BY THE 
ALLEGHENY COUNTY POLICE SHORTLY 
AFTER THE INCIDENT TAKES PLACE. 
THE ALLEGHENY COUNTY POLICE 
HANDLE MAJOR CRIMES OUTSIDE THE 
CITY OF PITTSBURGH ROUTE 
ALLEGHANY COUNTY. 
-- THROUGHOUT ALLEGHENY COUNTY. 
THE VICTIM, THE PERSON WHO WAS 
GRAZED ACROSS THE STOMACH, IS 
TREATED AND RELEASED. THERE IS 
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT THIS 
INTERSECTION. 
THAT VIDEO IS ATTACHED TO AN 
EXHIBIT TO THE AFFIDAVIT OF THE 
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT. 
WHAT IT SHOWS IS THE CHEVY CRUZ 
COMES UP BALDRIDGE, THERE ARE 
THREE OCCUPANTS IN THE CAR, 
DRIVER, FRONT SEAT PASSENGER, 
REAR PASSENGER SIDE. THE REAR 
WINDOW COMES DOWN, A HANDGUN 
COMES OUT THAT WINDOW, AND IT 
OPENS FIRE AND SOMEONE AT THE 
CORNER. 
WE BELIEVE WE KNOW WHO THE 
TARGET IS, BUT THE TARGET IS 
NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE AFFIDAVIT.
THE PERSON WHO IS SHOOTING THE 
WEAPON HAS A DARK-COLORED T-
SHIRT ON. 
THE PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT 
HAS A WHITE T-SHIRT ON. 
THERE IS A MAN IN NORTH 
BRADDOCK ACROSS THE STREET WHO 
IS NOT THE INTENDED VICTIM WHO 
RETURNS FIRE. WHEN THEY PROCESS 
THE SCENE, THERE ARE NINE 
CASINGS THAT GO BACK TO A 40 
MILLIMETER HANDGUN WHICH IS THE 
HANDGUN FROM THE CAR AND FOUR 
CASINGSFROM THE 45. 
FOR THE 45, HE STRIKES THE 
CHEVY CRUZ THREE TIMES. 
ONE GOES IN THE REAR WINDOW. 
ONE GOES INTO THE TRUNK TO THE 
RIGHT OF THE LICENSE PLATE. 
THE THIRD ONE GOES INTO THE 
PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. 
THERE ARE MULTIPLE STRIKES ON A 
WALL WHICH IS 10 TO 15 FEET 
FROM WHERE THE CHEVY CRUZ COMES 
UP BALDRIDGE AND THAT IS WHERE 
THE INTENDED TARGET IS. 
13 MINUTES INTO PROCESSING THIS 
PARTICULAR CRIME THAT OCCURRED 
IN NORTH BRADDOCK, A CALL COMES 
IN SAYING SHOTS ARE FIRED IN 
EAST PITTSBURGH. 
WHEN DETECTIVES ARRIVED, THE 
SCENE IS SECURED. 
THE VICTIM, ANTWON ROSE, HAD 
ALREADY BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE 
HOSPITAL. 
IT TAKES APPROXIMATELY FIVE 
MINUTES TO GET FROM THE SITE IN 
NORTH BRADDOCK TO THE SITE 
WHERE SHOTS ARE FIRED IN EAST 
PITTSBURGH. 
THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE IS IN 
CUSTODY. THE PASSENGER WITH THE 
DARK T-SHIRT IS IN THE -- AND 
SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS ARE LOOKING 
FOR HIM. 
THAT PERSON IS LATER IDENTIFIED 
AS HESTER. HE IS THE SHOOTER IN 
NORTH BRADDOCK. 
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, MR. ROSE NEVER 
DID ANYTHING IN FURTHERANCE OF 
ANY CRIMES IN NORTH BRADDOCK. 
I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME 
SPECULATION IN THE MEDIA. 
YESTERDAY OR POSSIBLY THE DAY 
BEFORE HESTER WAS APPREHENDED BY
THE SHERIFF'S FUGITIVE TEAM AND 
CURRENTLY LODGED AT A CENTER 
AND WILL BE CHARGED TO UNDER 
PENNSYLVANIA LAW AND COME INTO 
THE ADULT SIDE OF THE COURTS. 
AS IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE CAR, 
EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS STRUCK 
THREE TIMES, THERE IS NO BLOOD 
EVIDENCE IN THE CAR. 
ALL THE PASSENGERS WERE STRUCK 
IN NORT BRADDOCK. 
IN EAST PITTSBURGH THERE ARE 
THREE SPENT CASINGS. 
THEY ARE RECOVERED. 
THEY ARE FROM THE 9 MILLIMETER 
WEAPON. 
THAT IS THE WEAPON OF MICHAEL 
ROSFELD. 
THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES THAT 
ARE PROXIMATE TO THE LOCATION 
OF THE SHOOTING. 
THERE IS A VIDEO. FROM TALKING 
TO THE FAMILY THIS MORNING, WE 
WOULD LIKE TO GET THE PHONE AND 
DON'T HAVE THAT NOW BUT HAVE 
THE EUTERPE VERSION OF THE 
VIDEO. 
-- THE EUTERPE -- THE YOUTUBE 
VERSION OF THE VIDEO. 
IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THEY 
WANT TO ENHANCE IT MORE. 
THE DRIVER IS EXTRACTED FROM 
THE VEHICLE. 
HE IS ON THE GROUND. 
AS THE OFFICER BEGINS TO PUT 
HANDCUFFS ON HIM, THE TWO 
PASSENGERS GET OUT OF THE CAR. 
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, ANTWON 
ROSE SHOWS HIS HANDS, TURNS AND 
RUNS. 
HE IS NOT IN POSSESSION OF A 
WEAPON. 
NEITHER IS THE OTHER PASSENGER 
IN THE DARK T-SHIRT. 
THERE IS ANOTHER WITNESS WITH A 
VIDEO USING A CAMERA PHONE. 
THE VIDEO DOESN'T ADD MUCH TO 
THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE. 
THE CAR WAS PROCESSED AND THEY 
FOUND TWO WEAPONS IN THE 
VEHICLE. 
ONE IS A 9 MILLIMETER WEAPON 
THAT WAS STOLEN UNDER THE FRONT 
SEAT TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE 
CAR. 
THE .40-CALIBER WAS ALSO STOLEN 
AND GOES BACK TO THREE OR FOUR 
OTHER CRIMES UNDER THE FRONT 
SEAT TOWARDS THE REAR AND IS 
THE 90 CALIBER WEAPON THAT WAS 
USED IN CONNECTION IN THE 
SHOOTING IN NORTH BRADDOCK. 
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DID THE 
AUTOPSY AND SUBMITTED VARIOUS 
REPORTS. ANTWON ROSE WAS HIT 
THREE TIMES. 
HE WAS HIT IN THE SIDE OF THE 
FACE, IN THE CHEEK, AND THE 
BULLET EXITS THROUGH THE NASAL 
CAVITY. 
HE IS ALSO HIT IN THE RIGHT 
ELBOW FROM THE REAR. THAT IS A 
THROUGH AND THROUGH WOUND. 
HE IS HIT IN THE MID BACK AND 
THAT'S LOVE THAT WAS RECOVERED 
IN HIS CHEST. 
THAT IS THE FATAL SHOT. 
AS I SAID BEFORE, THAT 9 
MILLIMETERS SLUG MATCHES 
OFFICER ROSFELD'S SERVICE 
WEAPON. 
THE AT SCENE FACEBOOK POSTING 
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 
INDEPENDENT WITNESS STATEMENTS. 
AS I SAID BEFORE, THERE IS NO 
WEAPON THAT WOULD CREATE THE 
RISK TO OFFICER ROSFELD. 
BASED ON THAT EVIDENCE, I FIND 
THAT OFFICER ROSFELD'S ACTIONS 
WERE INTENTIONAL. 
THEY CERTAINLY BROUGHT ABOUT 
THE RESULT THAT HE WAS LOOKING 
TO ACCOMPLISH. 
HE WAS NOT ACTING TO PREVENT 
DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. 
IT IS MY POSITION HE IS NOT 
ENTITLED TO A JUSTIFICATION 
CHARGED TO A JURY AS A DEFENSE 
IN AS MUCH AS UNDER 
PENNSYLVANIA LAW IF YOU 
EFFECTUATE AN ARREST YOU HAVE 
TO SHOW THE PERSON BEING 
ARRESTED HAS COMMITTED A 
FORCIBLE FELONY. AS I SAID 
ALREADY ANTWON ROSE DIDN'T DO 
ANYTHING IN NORTH BRADDOCK 
OTHER THAN BE IN THE VEHICLE. 
YOU HAVE TO POSSESS A WEAPON. 
NEITHER OF THOSE YOUNG MEN WERE 
IN POSSESSION OF A WEAPON. 
WE HAVE TO OTHERWISE INDICATE 
THAT SOMEBODY IS IN A POSITION 
TO TAKE HUMAN LIFE AND THAT IS 
NOT THE CASE HERE. 
THESE ARE BASED UPON JURY 
INSTRUCTIONS IN A SUPERIOR 
COURT CASE OUT OF PHILADELPHIA. 
THE APPEAL WAS TAKEN IN 
PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT 
WHICH WAS DENIED. 
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THAT WE 
HAVE HAD THIS FACTUAL SCENARIO 
DURING MY TENURE. THE FIRST TWO 
DATE TO THE BEGINNING OF MY 
TENURE. 
YOU ARE AWARE I DIRECTED ONE 
COUNT OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE BE 
FILED IN THIS CASE AS IT WAS IN 
THE PRIOR TWO GIVEN THE SAME 
SCENARIOS. 
I CREDIT OUR CHIEFS OF POLICE 
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FOR GETTING IT. FOR 
INSTANCE LAST YEAR ALONE WE 
HAVE 1.2 MILLION CALLS TO LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND WE LOOKED INTO 
TWO MATTERS WHICH INVOLVED 
POLICE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. 
THAT IS STILL TWO TOO MANY, BUT 
JUST TO GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS. 
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WILL 
TAKE QUESTIONS. 
>> NO. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 
DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE? 
>> AS BEST WE CAN TELL HE IS 
LIKE AN UBER DRIVER. 
HE IS VERY FORTHCOMING. 
OF COURSE HE IS LOOKING AT 
DRIVING SOMEONE TO THE SCENE OF 
A SHOOTING HAS CRIMINAL 
IMPLICATIONS SO VERY 
FORTHCOMING WITH COUNTY POLICE. 
>> CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT THE 
CHARGES AND POSSIBILITIES? IS 
THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
PURSUED BY AN ATTORNEY AND WHAT 
ARE THE PENALTIES? 
>> THE CHARGES AGAINST THE 
OFFICER? 
ONE COUNT OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE 
AND IT SUPPORTS THIRD-DEGREE 
MURDER IN MY MIND. 
MANSLAUGHTER, INVOLUNTARY 
MANSLAUGHTER. 
WE THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO ARGUE MURDER IN THE 
FIRST-DEGREE. 
FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER? 
THAT IS LIFE. 
THIRD DEGREE IS 20 TO 40. 
MANSLAUGHTER IS 3 1/2 TO 7. 
>> IT IS AN INTENTIONAL ACT 
DONE RECKLESSLY AND THERE IS NO 
JUSTIFICATION FOR IT. 
>> OFFICER ROSFELD SAID HE 
BELIEVED THAT THE VEHICLE [ 
INAUDIBLE ], DO YOU DISPUTE 
THAT? 
>> WE TOOK A STATEMENT FROM 
OFFICER ROSFELD ON AUDIO AND 
VIDEO AND INDICATES THAT NO 
TIME WAS THERE A WEAPON IN 
PLAY. 
>> I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
>> THE OUTREACH OF YOUR FAMILY 
YOU HAD NO PRESSURE IN [ 
INAUDIBLE ]? 
>> I DID NOT. 
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE HAD 
THIS PARTICULAR SCENARIO DURING 
MY TENURE. 
WE CHARGE THE FIRST TWO TIMES 
AND WE CHARGE THIS TIME. 
>> HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THE 
ACTIONS OF OFFICER ROSFELD THAT 
NIGHT? 
>> I THINK I JUST DID. 
>> DID  FIRE A 
GUN? 
>> NO, HE DID NOT. 
>> ARE YOU AWARE OF HISTORY IN 
OFFICER ROSFELD'S PAST THAT YOU 
CAN SHARE THAT IS A DEPARTURE 
FROM ? 
>> THE COUNTY POLICE HAVE ALL 
HIS PERSONNEL FILES AND DON'T 
WANT TO GET INTO THAT TODAY. 
WE ARE AWARE OF HIS BACKGROUND. 
>> THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT 
AGAINST THE OFFICER GIVES 
INITIAL PREFERENCE TO [ 
INAUDIBLE ] AND MAKES A 
DIFFERENT STATEMENT LATER AND 
DESCRIBES THAT INCONSISTENCY. 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN WHAT HE SAID AND [ 
INAUDIBLE ]? 
>> HE SPECIFICALLY SAYS HE DID 
NOT SEE A WEAPON. 
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. 
>> IN THE STATEMENT HE SAYS HE 
BELIEVES  -- 
>> THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH 
WITNESS STATEMENTS AND THE 
YOUTUBE VIDEO. 
>> DOES HE NEED TO SEE A GUN OR 
JUST SOMETHING HE BELIEVES -- 
>> THE JURY INSTRUCTION SAYS 
THERE HAS TO BE A DEADLY 
WEAPON. 
>> DID OFFICER WAFT -- DID 
OFFICER ROSFELD EXPRESS HE WAS 
AFRAID AT THE TIME OF THE 
SHOOTING ? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT. 
I KNOW HE WAS REMORSEFUL. 
>> ONE INVOLVE THE CITY OF 
PITTSBURGH POLICE OFFICER ON 
SECOND AVENUE AND ONE INVOLVED 
A HOUSING AUTHORITY OFFICER IN 
THE ARMSTRONG TUNNELS. 
ALL THREE TIMES SOMEONE WAS 
SHOT IN THE BACK AND NOT A 
THREAT TO THE POLICE OFFICER 
ENGAGED IN WHATEVER ASPECT OF 
THEIR JOB. 
>> WAS OFFICER ROSFELD ARMED 
WITH A TASER? 
>> I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT 
ANTWON ROSE WAS ABOUT 15 YARDS 
BEFORE HE COLLAPSED. 
HE STARTS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE 
OF A RELATIVELY SMALL VEHICLE, 
BUT I DOUBT A TASER COULD HAVE 
BEEN USED. 
>> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
PREVIOUS SHOOTINGS IN NORTH 
BRADDOCK AND IN EAST PITTSBURGH 
 SUSPECTS WAS 
INVOLVED IN THAT SHOOTING, DOES 
HE GO IN WITH APPREHENSION -- 
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO GO IN 
WITH APPREHENSION. 
UNLESS YOU SEE A GENUINE THREAT 
THEN IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO 
TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE. 
>> THAT IS THE REASON -- 
>> PRIMARILY YES. 
>>  -- 
>> THEIR TRAINING SAYS YOU 
DISABLED THE VEHICLE FIRST 
WHICH HE DID. 
TAKE THE DRIVER OUT, KEYS OUT 
AND SHOW ME YOUR HANDS TYPE OF 
THING. 
HE GOT THREE GUYS IN A CAR. 
YOU WAIT FOR BACKUP. 
HE IS TAKING THREE GUYS OUT OF 
THE CAR BEFORE BACKUP GETS 
THERE. 
>>
>> I'M SORRY, I DON'T FOLLOW 
YOU. 
>>
>> ACTUALLY I BELIEVE IT IS 
THREE. 
THE OBJECT, THE LACK OF A GUN, 
AND IT GOES BACK TO AN OBJECT 
IN HIS HAND. 
THAT IS A JURY QUESTION. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO [ 
INAUDIBLE ]? 
>> WE HAD A VERY NICE 
CONVERSATION. 
THEY ARE VERY DECENT PEOPLE. 
OBVIOUSLY VERY DISTRAUGHT ABOUT 
THE LOSS OF THEIR SON WHO BY 
ALL INDICATIONS IS A GOOD KID. 
I WILL KEEP THAT PRIVATE 
BETWEEN US. 
IT WAS A GOOD CONVERSATION. 
>> . 
>> YOU CAN'T TAKE SOMEONE'S 
LIFE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. 
>>
>> YES. 
>> YOU KNOW THE GENESIS OF THE 
ACTOR WHERE THAT CAME FROM? 
>> THE GUN WAS STOLEN. 
THE CLIP IS WHAT THE ORIGINAL 
CLIP WAS FOR THE 9 MILLIMETER. 
THEY CHANGED THAT OUT FOR AN 
EXTENDED CLIP. 
INSTEAD OF NINE SHOTS YOU HAVE 
17. 
>> THEY CHANGED IT OUT TO THE 
OTHER GUN? 
>> NO. 
THERE IS A LONGER CLIP WITH THE 
9 MILLIMETER. 
SO INSTEAD OF NINE SHOTS I 
THINK IT IS 17. 
>> SO YOU ARE INDICATING HESTER 
FIRED THE SHOTS FROM THAT GUN 
AND THEN SWITCH THE CLIP? 
>> THERE ARE TWO GUNS IN THE 
CAR. 
THERE IS A 40 AND A NINE. 
BOTH GUNS ARE STOLEN. 
THE NINE IS UNDER THE FRONT 
SEAT AND NEVER DISCHARGE. 
THE 40 IS DISCHARGED FROM THE 
REAR SEAT. 
YOU GUYS WILL GET THE VIDEO 
FEEDS FROM BOTH NORTH BRADDOCK 
AND YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE 
FEEDS ON YOUTUBE. 
CLEARLY THE PERSON WHOSE ARM IS 
OUT THE WINDOW WITH GUN 
EXTENDED HAS A BLACK T-SHIRT 
ON. 
THOSE OTHER EVIDENCE INDICATE 
HESTER IS THE SHOOTER. 
>>
>> IT WAS IN THE WEAPON. 
YES. 
>> 
>> YOU TAKE THE CLIP OUT 
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY NINE SHOTS. 
YOU TAKE AN EXTENDED CLIP AND 
PUT IT IN AND IT 17. 
>> 
>> THE 9 MILLIMETER WAS NEVER 
DISCHARGED. 
THAT IS CORRECT. 
>>>> I 
DON'T KNOW IF HE SAID THAT IN 
HIS INTERVIEW ARE NOT. 
>>  
>> NORMALLY YOU WAIT FOR 
BACKUP, YES. 
YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PERSONS IN 
THE VIDEO. 
>> DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE TO 
CHARGE WITH  WILL 
THAT ULTIMATELY BE YOUR 
DECISION ? 
>> USUALLY WE CHARGE CRIMINAL 
HOMICIDE, JUST ONE COUNT 
GENERALLY. 
THAT GOES BACK TO WHEN WE HAD A 
CORONER INSTEAD OF A MEDICAL 
EXAMINER. 
WE WERE GETTING PRETTY BAD 
DECISIONS OUT OF THE CORONER'S 
OFFICE. 
>> TO CLARIFY,  
GENERAL CHARGE OF HOMICIDE HAS 
 RANGE OF 
POSSIBILITIES, TO CLARIFY YOUR 
REMARKS EARLIER YOU SAID THERE 
IS EVIDENCE FOR A THIRD, ARE 
YOU SAYING  THE 
EVIDENCE AT A MINIMUM SHOWS 
THAT AND YOU WILL PROSECUTE 
SEEKING FIRST-DEGREE? 
>> WE WOULD ASK A JURY TO 
CONSIDER ALL DEGREES OF 
HOMICIDE. 
>>
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
THAT'S WHY WE DO THAT. 
BECAUSE THE CORONER WAS MAKING 
THE DETERMINATION AND NOT A 
JURY. 
>> 
>> YES, MA'AM. 
>> >> WE 
OBJECTED TO IT, YES. 
YOU HAVE AN OFFICER IN THE 
COUNTY JAIL OTHERWISE. 
I AM NOT SURE SAFETY 
CONSIDERATIONS, SECURITY 
CONSIDERATIONS, THAT TYPE OF 
THING. 
WE OBJECTED AND WE TAKE THE 
MATTER UNDER ADVISEMENT. 
WE MAKE A DECISION. 
>>  DOES HER NEED 
TO BE MORE TRAINING ON WHAT 
NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THE 
OFFICER? 
>> IN ALLEGANY COUNTY WE HAVE 
THE ALLEGANY COUNTY CHIEFS OF 
POLICE ASSOCIATION WHICH IS AN 
AGGRESSIVE GROUP OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS. 
THOSE GUYS COME OUT WITH 
POLICIES AND CAN'T OBLIGATE 
INDIVIDUAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS 
TO FOLLOW THOSE POLICIES. 
IN THIS CASE, I AM CONCERNED OF 
THE LACK OF POLICIES AND 
PROCEDURES IN EAST PITTSBURGH. 
EAST PITTSBURGH IS NOT THE CITY 
OF PITTSBURGH. 
IT'S A SEPARATE MUNICIPALITY 
TOWARDS THE EASTERN PART OF THE 
COUNTY. 
WE HAVE 118 POLICE DEPARTMENT 
SOME OF WHICH ARE RUN VERY WELL 
AND SOME OF WHICH WE HAVE TO 
KEEP AN EYE ON ALL THE TIME. 
THAT IS A CREATURE OF THE 
LEGISLATURE. 
AT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT, WE ARE HERE 
TODAY LET'S TELL THEM TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.[ INAUDIBLE 
QUESTION ]TESTS ARE PENDING. 
AT THIS POINT WE DO NOT KNOW. 
PROBABLY THERE WILL NOT BE 
RESIDUE BECAUSE THE GUN WAS FAR 
ENOUGH OUT OF THE WINDOW THAT 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BLOWN BACK. 
>> ON HESTER? 
>> ON HESTER. 
BUT CLEARLY HESTER IS THE 
SHOOTER PACKED --? 
>> DID YOU TEST ? 
>> YES. 
>>  
>> UNDER THE ARREST AND 
GENERALLY SPEAKING AN OFFICER 
HAS TO BE IN FEAR OF DEATH OR 
SERIOUS BODILY INJURY AND THEN 
HE CAN RETURN THAT THREAT WITH 
APPROPRIATE FORCE. 
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO EFFECTUATE 
AN ARREST, WHAT YOU HAVE TO 
SURE SEVERAL THINGS. 
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THERE WAS A 
FORCIBLE FELONY, SHOOTING AT 
SOMEBODY IN NORTH BRADDOCK COULD
BE CONSIDERED A FORCIBLE FELONY 
BUT COMMITTED BY HESTER AND NOT 
BY ANTWON ROSE. 
YOU ALSO HAVE TO SHOW A WEAPON 
IS INVOLVED OR YOU ARE 
OTHERWISE IN SERIOUS BODILY 
INJURY. 
THOSE ELEMENTS CLEARLY ARE NOT 
THERE. 
>> TALKING ABOUT THE GUN, YOU 
SAID ANTWON ROSE DID NOT FIRE A 
GUN. 
BEING IN THE CAR AT THE DRIVE-
BY SHOOTING, DID THAT MAKE HIM 
A PARTY TO THE CRIME?? 
>> NO. 
>> THE DRIVER COULD BE. 
>> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE? 
>> WE NEED HIM AS A WITNESS. 
>> WHAT LED UP TO HIS DECISION 
TO BE ? 
>> WE HAVE AN IDEA ON MOTIVE 
BUT CAN'T COMMENT ON MOTIVE. 
>> 
>> I WILL TAKE THAT UP WITH THE 
U.S. ATTORNEY. 
>> YOU KNOW FOR A FACT THAT 
ANTWON ROSE ? 
>> YES, THEY KNEW EACH OTHER. 
>> REGARDING THE POLICIES ARE 
YOU SAYING THEY DID NOT HAVE A 
WELL-DEFINED POLICY ABOUT HOW 
TO CONDUCT THAT ? 
>> IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS BY 
THE MAJOR CRIME INVESTIGATORS 
WHEN THEY FIRST CAME ON SCENE 
IN EAST PITTSBURGH THEY SAID 
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE SITUATION 
AND THEY SAID WE DON'T HAVE 
POLICIES. 
THAT'S A DANGEROUS SITUATION. 
>> 
>> FOR ANYTHING. 
AS FAR AS WE KNOW. 
>> THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
PURSUING A CIVIL RIGHTS CASE 
AGAINST OFFICER ROSKAM? 
>> WE DON'T TOUCH WITH THE FBI 
HAS. 
>>
>> PRIMARILY WITH THE 
UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH. 
10 YEARS WITH THOSE GUYS. 
NOT LIKE HIS FIRST STOP. 
>> CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT THE 
DANGER OF NOT HAVING A POLICY 
AND PROCEDURES? 
>> SOMEBODY IS DEAD. 
CAN THERE BE ANY MORE DANGEROUS 
SITUATION? 
>>
>> CRIMINALLY? 
NO. 
CIVILLY? 
THEY GET -- THEY HAVE A LOT OF 
ANSWERING TO DO. 
>>
>> WE OBJECTED TO THE BOND THAT 
WAS ISSUED. 
>> GOING FORWARD ARE YOU LIKELY 
TO IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO TO 
BRING THAT MATTER IN ALLEGANY 
COUNTY JUDGE? 
>> THE WAY THE BOND WORKS IN 
ALLEGANY COUNTY IS INITIALLY 
IT'S A JUDICIAL FUNCTION. 
INITIALLY WHAT YOU DO IS IF YOU 
ARE AT THE COUNTY JAIL, YOU GO 
IN FRONT OF AN RAINING 
MAGISTRATE. 
THE INTAKE PEOPLE ARE THERE AND 
THE BAIL AGENCY IS THERE IN THE 
PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICE. 
WE DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THOSE 
TYPES OF MATTERS. 
BY CONSTITUTION, IF YOU CHARGE 
 
NOT BE ABLE TO BE BAILED. THE 
MAGISTRATE SETS THE BILL AT 
$250,000 UNSECURED. THAT IS A 
MATTER I WILL TALK TO THE JUDGE 
BECAUSE HE HEARS APPEALS FROM 
BOND ISSUES. 
>> WHEN YOU SAY TO CLARIFY YOU 
INTEND TO DO THAT, ARE YOU 
RULING OUT ? 
>> I WILL TALK TO MY TEAM AND 
SEE IF THAT AFFECTS HOW WE WILL 
TRY THE CASE. 
WE WILL MAKE A DECISION. 
>> THE PROCESS TOOK ABOUT AN 
HOUR  OF THE JAIL? 
>> IT'S HANDLED LIKE ANY OTHER 
HOMICIDE. 
>> 
>> WE HAVE AN IDEA BUT IT DEALS 
WITH MOTIVE AND I CANNOT 
COMMENT UNDER THE RULES OF 
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO 
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING [ 
INAUDIBLE ]? 
>> I AM TAKING CARE OF 
BUSINESS. 
>>
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT I REALLY 
DO HAVE AN OPINION. 
THE PEOPLE OWN THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IF THEY HAVE 
ISSUES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO 
EXPRESS THAT. 
>>
>> IT'S NOT A BLANKET RULING. 
AS I SAID BEFORE, THE SUPERIOR 
COURT ADDRESSED THIS IN THE MID-
90s IN TERMS OF THE JURY 
INSTRUCTION. 
THAT WAS APPEALED TO THE 
PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT 
WHICH WAS DENIED. IT WAS HEARD 
ON A COLLATERAL APPEAL IN 
FEDERAL COURT OF PHILADELPHIA 
WHO UPHELD THE SUPERIOR COURT 
DETERMINATION. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT TO BE 
THE STANDARD? 
>> IT IS THE STANDARD. 
>> THE STANDARD OF AN OFFICER 
NOT BEING  FLEEING 
SUSPECT? 
>> I'M NOT SAYING THAT. 
I JUST TOLD YOU THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH IT'S 
APPROPRIATE TO USE DEADLY FORCE 
WHEN EFFECTUATING AN ARREST. 
>> 
>> I REALLY CAN'T SPEAK TO 
THAT. 
HE IS IN THE CAR. 
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING IN 
FURTHERANCE IF YOU WANT TO CALL 
IT A CONSPIRATOR -- CONSPIRACY, 
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR 
FURTHERANCE OF THAT. 
>>>>
YOU COULD INFER THAT, YES. 
THERE IS OTHER EVIDENCE, BUT 
THAT IS REALLY OF NO MOMENT 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A HOMICIDE. 
>> SO IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO THE 
OFFICER'S ACTIONS OR HIS STATUS 
IN THAT INSTANCE? 
>> THE POSSESSION OF AN EMPTY 
CLIP, NO. 
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. 
>> LOVE --[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION 
] 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
PERSONAL ISSUES. 
THAT MAY BE RELEVANT AT TIME OF 
TRIAL. 
I AM TALKING TO YOU GUYS FROM 
THE SUBSTANCE OF AN AFFIDAVIT 
THAT SUPPORTS A CRIMINAL 
COMPLAINT SO LIMITED TO 
DISCUSSING THE ISSUES IN THE 
AFFIDAVIT. 
>> 
>> WE HAVE HIS ENTIRE PERSONNEL 
FILE. 
THE CHIEF WHO FORMERLY WAS THE 
CHIEF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
PITTSBURGH POLICE WAS ALSO 
FORMERLY CHIEF OF MIAMI METRO 
AND KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. 
WE TALKED TO HIM AT LENGTH. 
>> WILL THEY RELEASE THE 
PERSONNEL FILE? 
>> IT'S NOT PART OF THE 
PROSECUTION. 
>> LOW --[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION 
]>> YES. 
>> 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
DETAILS. 
>> YOU TALK ABOUT HIM SHOWING 
HIS HANDS AS HE RAN AWAY -- 
>> THE WITNESS SPECIFICALLY 
SAYS HIS HANDS GO UP AND HE 
TURNS IMMEDIATELY AND RUNS. 
BOTH WITNESSES ARE RIGHT THERE, 
THE CAR IS PARKED IN FRONT OF 
ME AND THE NEXT HOUSE OVER AND 
THE NEXT HOUSE OVER OUR 
WITNESSES. 
>>  
>> YES, EXITS, TURNS, BOTH.
>> THAT IS WHAT THE WITNESSES 
SAY. 
THAT IS WHAT THE VIDEO FROM 
YOUTUBE INDICATES. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO ENHANCE THAT, 
BUT WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT. 
>>  
>> I WANT TO SAY IT WAS THREE 
DAYS AGO. 
>>  
>> COUNTY POLICE. 
PINE HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
IT IS ON AUDIO AND VIDEO. 
>>  
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT. 
I CAN GET THAT FOR YOU. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US AND YOU 
MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED ON THIS BUT 
WHAT DID YOU HAVE  
IN THE INVESTIGATION TO KNOW [ 
INAUDIBLE ] CONSIDER A HUN LIFE 
IMPORTANT THINGS IN THIS 
COMMUNITY. 
DEALING WITH THOSE TYPES OF 
STRATEGIES. 
YOU DO NOT SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE 
BACK IF THEY ARE NOT A THREAT 
TO YOU. 
>> HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE 
THAT DECISION?[ INAUDIBLE 
QUESTION ]
>> I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE 
NUMBER OF SECONDS BUT IT WAS 
VERY QUICKLY. 
>> GOING BACK TO POLICE 
TRAINING,  ONE 
TIME OF YEAR THEY DO [ 
INAUDIBLE ] SHOULD BE INCREASED?
>> MOST OF THE GUYS IN THESE 
SMALL TOWNS TRAIN THEM IN 
STANDARDS CALLED AT 120. 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REFRESHER 
EVERY YEAR AND FIRE A WEAPON. 
OUR COMMUNITY -- ARE YOU FROM 
ALLEGANY COUNTY? 
>> YES. 
>> IN NORTH HILLS YOU FACE A 
DIFFERENT THREAT AND CRIME THAN 
YOU DO IN THE VALLEY OR YOU MAY 
DO IN THE APPROPRIATE CITY OF 
PITTSBURGH. SO THE GUYS WHO 
HANDLE MAJOR CRIMES ON A 
REGULAR BASIS USUALLY USE 
COUNTY POLICE. 
IF YOU GET IN A FIREFIGHT, YOU 
HAVE TO BE TRAINED PROPERLY. 
IT IS A CONSTANT BATTLE, BUT AS 
I SAID BEFORE THE CHIEFS OF 
POLICE IN OUR COUNTY A VERY 
PROGRESSIVE. 
I THINK THEY ARE A GREAT 
AGENCY.
