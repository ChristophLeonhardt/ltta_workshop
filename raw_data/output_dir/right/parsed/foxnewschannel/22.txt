GREATEST STATES.
THANKS.
THANK YOU.
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE FLORIDA
RACE IN JUST A MINUTE, BUT
FIRST, MORE REACTION TO OUR TOP
STORY.
THE BOMB SQUAD RESPONDING TO ONE
OF THE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES SENT
TODAY.
THIS ONE AT THE OFFICE OF
FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ BECAUSE HER
RETURN ADDRESS WAS ON IT.
THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF
FLORIDA HERE TO WEIGH IN ON
THAT, WELCOME.
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING.
IT'S DESPICABLE.
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION ON THINGS BUT THERE
SHOULD BE NO VIOLENCE AND AN
ATTACK LIKE THIS ON ONE PERSON
AND ONE AMERICAN IS AN ATTACK ON
ALL OF US.
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT
AND IT GOT TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.
>> Shannon: I UNDERSTAND THAT
FOR THE MOST PART THE
AUTHORITIES WILL BE TAKING THE
LEAD HERE.
ANYTHING THAT YOU WERE OTHER
LOCAL OR STATE AUTHORITIES CAN
DO TO HELP?
>> I STAYED UP WITH HER THROUGH
THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT
LAW ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT.
WE WILL PROVIDE WHATEVER
RESOURCES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
NEEDS TO DO A REVIEW LIKE THIS.
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT
AND WITH GOT TO HOLD THEM
ACCOUNTABLE AND WITH GOT TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE
DISAGREEMENTS.
BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO -- CAN'T
BE ANY VIOLENCE.
>> Shannon: HOW CAN WE DIAL IT
BACK?
YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TOUGH
CAMPAIGN WHICH WE ARE GOING TO
TALK ABOUT, BUT DO YOU THINK
THERE IS A MESSAGE TO OUR FELLOW
AMERICANS THAT WE CAN ALL
SOMEHOW GET ON THE SAME PAGE AND
GET AWAY FROM THOSE EXTREMES?
>> I THINK WHAT WE GOT TO DO IS
JUST REALIZED THAT WE ALL HAVE
TO HAVE OUR BELIEFS.
IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT I'M GOING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW WITH THIS
HURRICANE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING AS PEOPLE HAVE
COME TOGETHER.
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE STORIES
OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE HELPING EACH
OTHER -- THEY ARE NOT SAYING ARE
YOU REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, THEY
ARE SAYING DO YOU NEED A
GENERATOR, DO YOU NEED FOOD,
WATER, CAN I HELP YOU GET A TARP
ON YOUR ROOF?
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME
UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY JUST TO
FEED OTHER PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE
DOING, WE OUGHT TO BE COMING
TOGETHER.
>> Shannon: IS A PRODUCT OF
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE I KNOW
THOSE FOLKS ARE VERY HARDWORKING
AND RESILIENT AS WELL.
THE LAST CHECK IN WITH THE REAL
CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE HAS YOU
AT 44.7%, SENATOR NELSON AT
48.2%.
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TO GO, HOW
DO YOU HOPE TO CLOSE THE GAP?
>> IT'S A CLEAR CHOICE.
WE ARE GOING TO WIN.
SOMEBODY ASKED ME TODAY, THEY
SAID WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
IN MY CASE I'M A WORKER.
IN SENATOR NELSON'S CASE HE
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.
HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING.
HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR 42 YEARS,
NOTHING ON EDUCATION, NOTHING ON
THE ENVIRONMENT, NOTHING ON
TRANSPORTATION.
HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.
AND HERE'S WHAT HE DID WITH THIS
HURRICANE.
HE DID A FEW PHOTO OPS FOR THREE
OR FOUR DAYS AND HE SAYS I'M
DONE, THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN
DO.
AT THE REALITY IS THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE, THE STATE
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE, LOCAL
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE AND HE
SHOULD BE HELPING.
TOMORROW I WILL BE WITH
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE.
DECIMATED AND THAT'S A FEDERAL
AIR FORCE BASE.
SENATOR NELSON HAS DONE NOTHING
TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO GET
REBUILT BUT I WILL BE THERE WITH
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE TOMORROW
AND TALK TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT
IT.
WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD IT.
>> Shannon: LET ME ASK ABOUT A
COUPLE OF THINGS AND GIVE YOU A
CHANCE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF
YOUR CRITICS IN FLORIDA.
PETE NAISMITH WAS THE DASH
SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, HAS THIS
TO SAY ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF RED
TIDE, THE BLUE-GREEN ALGAE.
HE SAYS HE'S GOT DENIED CLIMATE
SCIENCE AND SLASHED PROTECTIONS
CONCLUDING TO THE CRISIS THAT'S
DEVASTATING FLORIDA BUSINESSES,
KILLING WILDLIFE AND THREATENING
FAMILIES HEALTH.
AND HERE IS A BIT OF AN AD FROM
THE LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION
VOTERS AS WELL.
>> RICK SCOTT TOOK OVER A
MILLION BUCKS FROM CORPORATE
POLLUTERS AND SAVAGED
ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS,
SLASHING 700 MILLION FROM WATER
PROTECTION.
NO WONDER HE DOESN'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.
>> Shannon: HOW DO YOU
RESPOND, GOVERNOR?
>> LIVE IN REALITY.
FIRST OFF, RED TIDE HAS BEEN
AROUND SINCE THE 1840s AND
IT'S NATURALLY OCCURRING.
WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE A WHOLE
BUNCH OF THINGS TO HELP ALL OF
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES.
SENATOR NELSON HAS NEVER DONE
ONE THING.
WE'VE ALSO HAD ISSUE OR WE HAVE
TOO MUCH RAIN BECAUSE
LAKE OKEECHOBEE, FEDERAL
PROJECT, SENATOR NELSON AND
BARACK OBAMA WOULDN'T FIND IT.
WITHOUT ALGAE ISSUES BECAUSE
BILL NELSON DOESN'T DO HIS JOB.
WE HAVE FUNDED A FEDERAL PROJECT
TO STOP IT AND ACTUALLY ONCE
PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT ELECTED NOW
I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CONGRESS, WE
ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT
ISSUE.
BILL NELSON HAS NEVER DONE ONE
THING ON THE ENVIRONMENT OTHER
THAN HE WILL RUN AN AD ABOUT IT
BUT HE WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO QUICKLY
MAKE SURE I ASK YOU THIS.
VERY LIMITED TIME HERE BUT A
CABLE NEWS HOST THIS MORNING
ESSENTIALLY CALLED YOU A LIAR
WHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD
PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING
CONDITIONS AND MAKE SURE THEY
CAN GET SOME FORM OF HEALTH
INSURANCE.
THAT'S THE WORK HE USED, HE SAID
YOU ARE A LIAR.
>> IT'S PERSONAL TO ME.
I GREW UP NOT KNOWING MY DAD.
I HAD A BROTHER WITH A
SIGNIFICANT DISEASE.
MY MOM DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH CARE
OUR HEALTH INSURANCE -- SHE
COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY TO TAKE
CARE OF MY BROTHER.
SHE FINALLY FOUND A CHARITY
HOSPITAL FOUR HOURS AWAY.
SO I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OUGHT
TO HAVE A RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE.
HE SHOULDN'T BE DENIED OR
HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IF YOU
HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.
HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE, SENATOR
SENATOR NELSON WAS A STATEHOUSE
MEMBER, NEVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT
IT.
HE WAS THE STATE INSURANCE
COMMISSIONER, NEVER DID ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.
HE WAS A CONGRESSMAN, DID
NOTHING ABOUT IT.
WHEN THEY VOTED FOR WHAT WE
COULD CALL THE UNAFFORDABLE
HEALTH CARE ACT IT WAS TWO
LITTLE GOOD PIECES IN THE BILL.
YOU SHOULD NOT BE DENIED
HEALTH CARE IF YOU HAVE A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAY ON
YOUR PARENTS PLAN, BUT THE REST
OF THE BILL IS A DISASTER.
BILL NELSON HAS NEVER DONE
ANYTHING TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE
OTHER THAN MAKE THE COST GO UP,
DEDUCTIBLES GO UP, PREMIUMS GO
UP AND COPAYMENTS GO UP.
>> Shannon: WE WISH YOU ALL
