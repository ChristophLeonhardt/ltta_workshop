1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:11,956
>> Laura: COULD THIS BE THE

2
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:12,857
BREAKTHROUGH THAT TRUMP VOTERS

3
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,092
HAVE BEEN WANTING?

4
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:15,193
KEVIN McCARTHY INTRODUCED A

5
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:16,661
BILL EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT

6
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:18,162
WOULD            FUND

7
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:18,997
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WALL ON THE

8
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:20,798
BORDER BUT IT HAS TO MOVE FAST.

9
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:23,735
IF THIS BILL PASSES, IT WOULD

10
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:25,737
HAVE TO GO    GO TO THE SENATE W

11
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:25,770
HAVE TO GO    GO TO THE SENATE T

12
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:25,803
HAVE TO GO    GO TO THE SENATE H

13
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:25,837
HAVE TO GO    GO TO THE SENATE 6

14
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:26,137
HAVE TO GO    GO TO THE SENATE 0

15
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:26,170
HAVE TO GO    GO TO THE SENATE 6

16
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:26,771
HAVE TO GO    GO TO THE SENATE 0

17
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:27,538
VOTES TO AVOID A FILIBUSTER

18
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,542
BEFORE JANUARY.

19
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:32,944
ALL RIGHT CONGRESSMAN

20
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,579
McCARTHY, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

21
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,747
IF THIS WERE TO PASS THE HOUSE,

22
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:38,383
AND THAT'S A BIG "IF," HOW DOES

23
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:39,350
THE SENATE HAVE ANY STOMACH OR

24
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:42,020
THE VOTES FOR THIS?

25
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:45,256
>> I DON'T THINK THE QUESTION IS

26
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:50,028
IF IT WILL PASS THE HOUSE, IT'S

27
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:51,663
BUILD THE WALL AND IT EVEN DOES

28
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:52,797
MORE.

29
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:58,202
CASE LAW WHICH WE PASSED, AND IT

30
00:00:58,203 --> 00:00:58,970
KEEPS CHILDREN SAFE BECAUSE IT

31
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:02,440
REMOVES THE MS-13 GANG MEMBERS.

32
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:05,910
IT DENOUNCES THIS MOVEMENT

33
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:07,045
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ILLEGALS TO

34
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,147
VOTE IN OUR ELECTION.

35
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,381
BUT I SAW WHAT McCONNELL SAID

36
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:12,216
TODAY, HE SAID WE WILL HAVE THE

37
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,785
BIGGEST FIGHT OVER THE WALL IN

38
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:14,318
DECEMBER.

39
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:14,986
WATCHING WHAT THE SENATE WAS

40
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:17,622
ABLE TO DO WITH KAVANAUGH, I

41
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:18,656
BELIEVE THIS GIVES HIM THE

42
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:20,692
OPPORTUNITY AND THE TIME TO GET

43
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:22,160
THIS DONE ONCE AND FOR ALL.

44
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:25,129
>> I KEEP THINKING, GIVEN HOW

45
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,898
GREAT IT WAS TO HAVE THE PARTY

46
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:27,765
UNIFIED FOR THE SUPREME COURT

47
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:30,134
SEAT, IF THE PARTY HAD BEEN

48
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:31,135
UNIFIED, AND THAT FIRST YEAR OF

49
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,737
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OF THE

50
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:34,038
ISSUE, WHICH WAS ONE OF HIS

51
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,507
SEMINAL ISSUES ON THE CAMPAIGN

52
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:45,149
TRAIL.

53
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,818
AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR GETTING TO

54
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,654
THIS NOW BUT, THE STORY TODAY, I

55
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:51,956
THINK I JUST SAW TODAY IN

56
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:52,757
ARIZONA THAT A DETENTION

57
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:53,558
FACILITY THERE WAS SO FULL OF

58
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:57,962
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STEAL

59
00:01:57,963 --> 00:01:59,564
TREATMENT ACROSS THE BORDER,

60
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:00,398
THEY CAN'T SEPARATE FAMILIES.

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,834
IT'S SO FULL, THEY HAD TO DO A

62
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:07,271
MASS RELEASE.

63
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:11,976
HE DOESN'T WANT THE STUFF.

64
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:14,979
>> THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

65
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,614
THAT MAKES AMERICA THE

66
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,216
STRONGEST, IT BREAKS DOWN OUR

67
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:18,583
SOCIETY.

68
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:19,383
OUR COMMUNITIES WILL NOT BE SAFE

69
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:22,820
IF YOU CAN'T SECURE YOUR OWN

70
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:23,154
BORDERS.

71
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:25,189
THINK OF THE AMOUNT OF FENTANYL

72
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,791
OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT COMES

73
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:27,125
ACROSS.

74
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:28,960
>> CONGRESSMAN, THEY DON'T CARE.

75
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:30,695
THEY CARE MORE ABOUT THEIR

76
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:34,699
LIBERAL SOCIAL CONDUCT BEING

77
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,972
FOISTED ON AMERICA.

78
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,373
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE KIDS OR THE

79
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:43,107
RULE OF LAW, THEY DON'T CARE

80
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:45,843
ABOUT THAT.

81
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:52,784
IT'S ABOUT REDEFINING AMERICA,

82
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:53,751
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS

83
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:54,352
ABOUT.

84
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:55,686
THIS IS THE ABILITY TO BUILD THE

85
00:02:55,687 --> 00:03:01,359
WALL AND ENFORCE THE LAW, OR

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,393
HAVE NO BORDER WHATSOEVER.

87
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:02,927
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN

88
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:05,296
SAN FRANCISCO TODAY ALLOWING

89
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,864
ILLEGALS TO VOTE IN OUR

90
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:09,333
ELECTION, POOR, THEY WANT TO

91
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:09,967
ELIMINATE I.C.E.

92
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:12,370
I WISH EVERY AMERICAN WOULD

93
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,070
SPEND ONE DAY WITH THE BORDER

94
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,772
PATROL AGENT.

95
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:15,740
WHEN I WAS IN EL PASO THIS WAS

96
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:18,009
THE FIRST PLACE OF THE BORDER

97
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,577
CONTROL BEGAN.

98
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:26,717
IF THEY SPENT ONE DAY WITH

99
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:27,718
THEM -- >> Laura: THIS IS WHY

100
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:33,024
WE HAVE FOX NEWS, THIS HORRIBLE

101
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,959
EXAMPLE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

102
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,561
CRIME, A WOMAN IN NEW YORK.

103
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:38,162
NO COVERAGE OF THIS FOR THE MOST

104
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:40,464
PART IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA,

105
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:41,165
ZERO.

106
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,500
THEY CARE ABOUT WOMEN BUT WE

107
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,602
HAVE A WOMAN AT THE HANDS OF AN

108
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:47,171
ILLEGAL ALIEN AND IT'S JUST LIKE

109
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:49,407
IT NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.

110
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:51,742
CONGRESSMAN, WE HAVE TO GET YOU

111
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,678
TO REACT TO THIS EVER-INCREASING

112
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:58,249
MOB LIKE ATMOSPHERE AMONG A VERY

113
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,986
STRONG VERY ILLUSTRATED PARTY.

114
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,688
>> THE PEOPLE HERE THAT AND

115
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,756
THINK WHAT YOU ARE CALLING FOR

116
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:09,160
HIS PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION,

117
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,830
THINGS THAT PRAY THE SOCIAL

118
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:13,564
FABRIC.

119
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:15,132
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE.

120
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,367
IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO REDEFINE

121
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:17,602
PROTEST AND CALL IT SOMETHING

122
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:19,837
ELSE, THEY WILL TRY TO DO THAT.

123
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,606
WE ARE SHOUTING OUT, WE HAVE

124
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,207
SCIENCE, WE ARE SAYING WHAT WE

125
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,042
THINK, WE GET TO THE PUBLIC AND

126
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,844
WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT WE ARE

127
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,446
GOING TO KILL ANYBODY OR HIT

128
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:29,180
ANYBODY.

129
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,082
FOR WE ARE GOING TO CAUSE

130
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,084
ANYBODY ANY HARM, THAT'S A LIE

131
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:36,187
IN THE WAY THAT THEY ARE TRYING

132
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,154
TO REDEFINE PROTEST.

133
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:38,055
>> Laura: CONGRESSMAN, WE ARE

134
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,558
OUT OF TIME BUT WHAT DOES THAT

135
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,393
ALL MEAN, GET IN YOUR FACE?

136
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:43,794
>> THAT MEANS IF THEY WERE TO

137
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,162
WIN THE MAJORITY SHE WOULD BE

138
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:46,430
THE CHAIR OF FINANCIAL SERVICES,

139
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:48,766
ONE WHO ASKS PEOPLE TO CAUSE

140
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,569
PROBLEMS TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS.

141
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,970
IT'S WHAT WE EXPECT OF OUR

142
00:04:52,971 --> 00:00:00,000
ELECTED OFFICIALS WHICH IS WHY
