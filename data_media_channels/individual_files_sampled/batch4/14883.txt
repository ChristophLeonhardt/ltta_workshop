in November I actually sent out a letter from axe the carbon tax and take back our PC party to some PC Party supporters I exposed Patrick Browns lies with regards to the carbon tax with regards to how he's playing fast and loose and ignoring the party Constitution on how we select candidates and I told the truth and I informed these members former and current members that they had the power to fix things under the party Constitution Constitution and they just needed to stay in the party and then Patrick Brown lost it he lost his mind he went crazy or something I don't know next thing I know the PC Party executive starts a lawsuit against me it's the first time in Canada that I know of in my research that a political party has sued an individual let alone one of its own party members then they revoke my membership then they barred me from entering their convention in November then they started a whisper campaign attacking my character to some media and the candidates in the caucus luckily on December 22nd on Ontario Court judge thrill at the PC party's lawsuit and he said quote it lacked substantive merit and he said it was a strategic attempt by the PC Party executive to limit my freedom of speech so here I'm running two campaigns the debating political issues and the Ontario piece of Party executive and Patrick Brown collude and resort to heavy-handed tactics to try to shut down this grassroots movement well Ontario conservative grassroots activist Jim Tara Helios is the founder of two conservative organizations acts the tax and take back our PC party and you know folks by all accounts he's a true-blue conservative but alas in the bizarro world of Ontario PC leader Patrick Brown being a true-blue activist makes terra helios persona non grata indeed Jim's being stripped of his PC Party membership and as you saw he's even faced legal action initiated by the party simply because he wants the interior PCs to follow their own constitution and listen to their own grassroots members Wow the nerve of this guy joining me now is the whole of the gun show Sheila Gunn read with more on the latest Fiasco brewing in Ontario PC country Sheila welcome once again to rebel roundup hey David thanks for having me always a pleasure now listen Sheila you're no stranger when it comes to trouble in conservative circles given what's occurred in Alberta over the last several years so given that Kyra Helios seem to be the kind of conservative the PC party would want to have on its side why instead is this guy being shunned by the party establishment well one can only speculate I mean I look at this stuff through in Alberta centric lens we just spent the last two years fighting over who was more conservative on the right side of the spectrum between the remnants of our PC Party and the Wildrose party they've now united into the United conservative party but it looks like in Ontario everybody's fighting over who gets to be more liberal the Liberals or the PCs and Jim is just they're trying to make everybody remember that there's the PCs there's actually two letters there there's the progressives and the Conservatives and he's trying to remind them that you know our leadership have to follow the rules and we have to put some daylight in between ourselves and the Liberals in Ontario and nobody's listening but it's worse than them not just listening they're trying to shut him up they threw him out of the party and filed a lawsuit it is amazing and by the way when we talk about his activism in the axe attacks what he's talking about of course Sheila is the carbon tax and what I find astounding what conservatives find astounding what you know PC party faithful once upon a time find astounding is that one of the very first things Patrick Brown said after being declared leader of the PC party at the AGM meeting was bringing in a carbon tax now Ontario is or maybe was a manufacturing province Sheila why in the world would a future premier want to bring in a carbon tax for a manufacturing province and put it at an economic disadvantage it's politically tone-deaf especially when Ontario's biggest con their biggest competition for manufacturing is right across the border in Detroit and the entire American Rust Belt and we're seeing a renaissance in the Rust Belt because Donald Trump is refusing to bring in a carbon tax and dropping regulations and lowering taxes and Patrick Brown is promising to bring in more it it doesn't make any sense and it doesn't it shows that the conservative movement in Ontario has learned nothing from the two most successful conservative movements on the continent right now and I'm talking about Donald Trump and Jason Kenney here in Alberta they're two different very different style of conservatism one is more ideological and one is more populist but at the same time they've campaign on saying and doing things that are absolutely conservative there's no mistaking them for liberals and Patrick Brown and Kathleen Wynne MA one's wearing a tie you know from the outside looking and that's the only difference for me yeah it's absolutely incredible of course Jim's other big campaign is about listening to the grassroots and Sheila I can tell you because I've seen this firsthand I've last year I went to three nomination meetings I'm telling you it was like witnessing a combination of George Orwell's 1984 Meets The Three Stooges it was every rule in the book was being broken you had the police called in on a couple of occasions because they didn't like the presence of certain people outside the building where the nomination meeting was was taking place and they were not listening to the local nomination committee at all they had their own people they wanted to put in and that was who they were gonna go with what is driving this it seems to me Sheila they are just alienating their base that's what's going to happen here good conservatives are just going to stay home because principle people won't vote for people with no principles and that's what we're seeing here I mean the kind of stuff that Patrick Brown is being accused of doing and like you say you saw evidence of it firsthand in Ontario with these nominations is the kind of thing that sane otherwise normal conservatives would light their hair on fire about if we heard that Justin Trudeau was doing these sorts of things but in Ontario for some reason if conservatives expect Patrick Brown to be better the natural inclination is for people to say well you want Kathleen Wynne to slide into victory one more time if you just want a more principled conservative movement it doesn't make any sense and it is going to lead to the ultimate fracture of your PC Party which is actually something Jim Carrey Helios is trying to prevent no and tell me on that point Sheila I'm just wondering if given how awful this liberal provincial government has been with all the several multibillion-dollar scandals with wins declining popularity I don't know if Sheila can Patrick Brown actually blow this come June he is blowing it he is blowing it how do you not be beating Kathleen Wynne right now yeah we threw out the PCs for far less they were trying to build themselves a penthouse in one of the government buildings and they were using the government men or government airplanes as their private minivans here in Alberta and we threw them out because it was too corrupt but we've seen the PC party in Ontario their polling is just going down and down and down as Kathleen Wynne gets progressively worse and worse I think there is no stomach to support a PC party that is essentially the liberal light you know but here's a thing Sheila if he does go down in flames and I think you're right I think we're wit he should be miles ahead in the polls given the kind of government that he's going up again but here's the big question I think going back to 2007 we had John Tory then we had Tim Hudak then we had Tim Hudak 2.0 then we've got Patrick Brown which seems you know to be an utter disaster at this stage in the game if he goes down in defeat does anything change in the PC Party of Ontario establishment I'm talking about guys like Dykstra the party president Stanley the executive director because if nothing changes there I think we're just going to get more of the same come for years from from from this year yeah I agree with you I think as much as I don't want to see it to successfully retake the conservative movement there will have to be a fracturing of it we saw that with the Reform Party when they fractured away from the federal pcs we saw that here in Alberta with the Wildrose when they left the PCs there has to be some sort of purge by fire so that the PC party ëletís know that the electorate is serious right now we've got those old peace years left over they're just basically insignificant now in the political landscape because the people took back the party and I don't see another way to get rid of win unless something like that happens in Ontario I agree with you Sheila what what a tragedy yet again for the for time running and I know the election is some six months away that's an eternity in politics so much can happen but you know this man's alienated social conservatives he's alienated fiscal conservatives I don't know who's left to come out to the the ballot box Sheila Gunn read once again thank you so much for your insight and spending some time with us on rebel roundup today great thank
