"We don't really believe there
is a functional conservative
party in this country,
and we certainly
don't think the
Republican Party is that."
Steve Bannon, a founding
member of Breitbart News,
a site that he has called a
platform for the alt-right,
has been a lightning rod for
critics of President Trump
since he joined the
campaign in August 2016.
"It's a stunning thing that
a white supremacist, Bannon,
would be a permanent member of
the National Security Council."
During his time in the
Trump administration,
Bannon's status has
ebbed and flowed.
He's been seen as
the president's link
to his populist base.
But Ivanka Trump and Jared
Kushner are critics of him.
Gen. John F. Kelly,
Trump's new chief of staff,
has also reportedly
raised concerns
about working with Bannon.
This past weekend,
Anthony Scaramucci,
the president's communications
director for a fleeting 10
days, called him out on
TV as sympathetic to white
nationalism.
"I've never sat down with
Steve Bannon and said, hey,
are you a white nationalist
or a white supremacist?
But I think the toleration
of it by Steve Bannon
is inexcusable."
And H.R. McMaster, President
Trump's national security
adviser, has deflected
questions about Bannon.
"Can you and Steve Bannon
still work together
in this White House or not?"
"Hey, I get to work
together with a broad range
of talented people."
"You didn't answer.
Can you and Steve Bannon work
in that same White House?"
"I am -- I am ready to work with
anybody who will help advance
the president's agenda."
"Do you believe Steve
Bannon does that?"
"I believe that everyone who
works in the White House, who
has the privilege, the
great privilege every day,
of serving their nation should
be motivated by that goal."
Trump may also be
souring on Bannon.
The president has
been frustrated
with his chief strategist
since a Time magazine cover
story called Bannon the
second-most powerful man
in the world.
"You will not replace us!"
The question now in the wake
of Charlottesville is whether
Bannon, often criticized as
emblematic of the far-right
nationalism that turned
violent in Virginia,
can salvage a role in
the administration --
or if he even wants to.
