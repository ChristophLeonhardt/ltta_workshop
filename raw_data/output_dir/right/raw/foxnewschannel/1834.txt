00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:10,964
LEGALIZING POT.

12
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:15,736
THIS AS A RECENT SURVEY

13
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:17,170
FOUND A NUMBER OF COMPANIES

14
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,004
IN COLORADO TESTING FOR

15
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,272
MARIJUANA IS ON THE DECLINE

16
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:21,942
SO IS THIS A GOOD IDEA?

17
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:24,211
HIRE TO DEBATE FORMER SENIOR

00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:36,723
GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU.

26
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:37,824
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

27
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:40,894
>> GOOD MORNING.

28
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:41,762
ABBY: THIS IS NOT TO DEBATE

29
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:43,296
WHETHER YOU ARE PRO-OR LEGAL

30
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:44,131
RIDING MARIJUANA.

31
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,031
SURVEY SHOWING THAT MORE

32
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,266
COMPANIES ARE JUST OPTING

33
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:46,900
OUT OF TESTING THEIR

34
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,401
EMPLOYERS FOR THE USE OF

35
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:48,769
MARIJUANA.

36
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:49,402
IS THAT SOMETHING PEOPLE

37
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:50,070
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT?

38
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,104
>> WELL, IT IS.

39
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:53,140
FIRST OF ALL, IN COLORADO,

40
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,807
THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS

41
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:55,776
HAS HAD TO HIRE OUT OF STATE

42
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:56,877
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND

43
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,178
PEOPLE TO PASS A DRUG TEST.

44
00:00:58,178 --> 00:00:59,980
WE NEED PEOPLE TO PASS DRUG

45
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,915
TESTS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY IN

46
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:03,116
SAFETY SENSITIVE CONDITIONS.

47
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:04,818
I DON'T WANT MY PILOT AND

48
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:06,086
DOCTOR AND KID'S BUS DRIVER

49
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:08,021
TO BE TESTING POSITIVE FOR

50
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:08,388
MARIJUANA.

51
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:09,589
I THINK THIS IS VERY BAD

52
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:09,890
NEWS.

53
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,558
TODAY'S POT IS SO MUCH MORE

54
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:13,727
HARMFUL THAN IT USED TO BE.

55
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:16,062
THC CONTENT POTENCY IS 10 TO

56
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:17,397
30 TIMES GREATER.

57
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,199
ALL THESE EDIBLES, CANDIES

58
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,467
AND COOKIES AND OILS.

59
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,169
WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER

60
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,170
TOBACCO INDUSTRY.

61
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,372
WE ARE REELING OFF OF BIG

62
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:26,973
PHARMA OPIATE CRISIS BY DO

63
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:28,241
WE WANT BIG MARIJUANA?

64
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,409
IT'S A BAD IDEA AND TERRIBLE

65
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:30,544
FOR AMERICAN JOBS AND FOR

66
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:33,280
THE WORKFORCE.

67
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,047
ABBY: CAROLINE, CRITICS TO

68
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,482
THIS DAY SAY LEGALIZING

69
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:36,683
MARIJUANA CAN ULTIMATELY

70
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:37,851
LEAD TO MORE CRIMES, MAYBE

71
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,486
MORE USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS.

72
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:40,854
I TALK TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT

73
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:41,688
THIS ALL THE TIME.

74
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:42,689
SOMEHOW THAT ANY DIFFERENT

75
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,857
THAN PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO

76
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,192
DRINK ALCOHOL?

77
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,393
, UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF

78
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:46,726
ALCOHOL.

79
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:47,994
YOU COMPARE THE TWO AND

80
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:49,296
WONDERING WHY ONE IS TOTALLY

81
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:51,698
ILLEGAL

82
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:52,132
ISLEGAL

83
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:52,165
IS TGAL

84
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:52,199
IS TOTL

85
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,433
IS TOTALLY LEGAL AND ONE IS

86
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:53,700
NOT.

87
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,734
>> ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

88
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:55,735
TALK ABOUT BIG ALCOHOL.

89
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:56,870
THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR

90
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,138
MISTAKES MADE IN BIG ALCOHOL

91
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:00,006
AND BIG TOBACCO THAT THE CAN

92
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:00,774
BUSINESS INDUSTRY HAS THE

93
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,175
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM.

94
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:03,243
PEOPLE IN THE CAN BUSINESS

95
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:04,444
INDUSTRY ARE READY TO WORK

96
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:06,179
WITH STATE REGULATORS, TO

97
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,548
ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE

98
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:10,417
PUT IN PLACE SO ADULTS CAN

99
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:11,351
CONSUME CAN BUSINESS WHEN

100
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,854
AND WHERE THEY SHOULD.

101
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:14,654
ABBY: LOOK AT RECENT POLLING

102
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:15,956
ON, THIS BECAUSE IT'S

103
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:17,023
CHANGED PRETTY QUICKLY OVER

104
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,258
THE PAST 10 YEARS.

105
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:20,360
RECENT CBS POLL SHOWS 6 IN

106
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,194
10 NOW, MAJORITY OF

107
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:22,262
AMERICANS SUPPORT LEGALIZING

108
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:22,629
MARIJUANA.

109
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,997
YOU LOOK AT THEIR POLL JUST

110
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:24,965
6 OR 7 YEARS AGO.

111
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:25,966
IT WAS THE COMPLETE

112
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:26,333
OPPOSITE.

113
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,133
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING

114
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:28,068
>> ACTUALLY WHEN YOU WORD

115
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,336
THE POLLING DIFFERENTLY YOU

116
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,670
GET A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

117
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,004
ANSWER.

118
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:31,638
WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE

119
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:33,306
CHOICE OF DECRIMINALIZATION

120
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:34,241
WHICH IS ABOUT NOT PUTTING

121
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,508
PEOPLE IN PRISON WHICH I

122
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:37,177
AGREE WITH FOR MARIJUANA

123
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:38,178
VERSUS SELLING IT AND MAKING

124
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:39,880
AN INDUSTRY OUT OF IT.

125
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,081
THE DECRIMINALIZATION PART

126
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,182
IS MORE POPULAR THAN

127
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:42,616
LEGALIZATION.

128
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:43,650
SO, ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU ASK

129
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,417
THE YES, NO.

130
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:45,919
YOU MIGHT GET THAT ANSWER.

131
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,020
REALITY IS ALCOHOL IS IN AND

132
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,656
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM WITHIN 24

133
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:50,457
HOURS.

134
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:53,460
THC IS FAT SOLUBLE,

135
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,261
INTOXICATED OFTEN AFTER YOU

136
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,495
MIGHT FEEL INTOXICATED WHILE

137
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:56,830
IT'S STILL IN YOUR SYSTEM.

138
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,564
AND LET ME TELL YOU

139
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:58,164
SOMETHING, THE MARIJUANA

140
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:59,799
INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE

141
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,167
DOING THIS FOR ONE THING AND

142
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:01,801
ONE THING ONLY.

143
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:02,702
THAT'S TO MAKE MONEY.

144
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:03,503
THIS IS ABOUT MONEY.

145
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:04,471
THIS IS ABOUT MONEY FOR A

146
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:05,672
SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

147
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,140
AND I DON'T THINK IT ENDS

148
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,440
WELL.

149
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,108
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE

150
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:09,809
ARE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON BIG

151
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:10,143
TOBACCO.

152
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:11,278
YOU CAN'T SMOKE ANYWHERE.

153
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,179
WE ARE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON

154
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:14,848
BIG OPIATES AND OPENING THE

155
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:16,016
DOOR TO BIG MARIJUANA.

156
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:17,584
NOT GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY AND

157
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,886
CERTAINLY NOT GOOD FOR OUR

158
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:20,253
KIDS.

159
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:20,921
ABBY: HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND

160
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:21,254
TO THAT.

161
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:22,389
>> I WOULD COUNTER THAT BY

162
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,623
LEGAL RIDING CAN BUSINESS AT

163
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:24,758
THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT WILL

164
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,059
ALLOW PEOPLE TO WORK HAND IN

165
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,560
HAND TOGETHER TONE SURE THAT

166
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,229
DOCTORS, PATIENTS AND

167
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:30,230
EMPLOYERS UNDERSTAND DOSING

168
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,731
AND HAVE A BETTER

169
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:32,866
UNDERSTANDING OF IMPAIRMENT.

170
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:33,833
>> WE HAVE NEVER GOT

171
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,401
CONTINUE RIGHT BEFORE.

172
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:35,902
WE HAD DOCTORS WITH THE

173
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:36,336
OPIATE CRISIS.

174
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,004
WE HAD DOCTORS BEING PAID

175
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,306
FROM BIG TOBACCO.

176
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,473
WE HAD THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY

177
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:40,840
AS WELL.

178
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,809
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO

179
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:43,310
FINALLY REGULATE.

180
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,177
>> WE ALSO HAVE THOSE

181
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,545
LESSONS TO REFLECT ON NOW.

182
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:47,013
>> I WISH YOU WOULD THE

183
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:48,648
PROBLEM IS THE MARIJUANA

184
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,283
INDUSTRY IS NOT INTERESTED

185
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:50,917
IN THE LESSONS.

186
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,353
>> THE CAN BUSINESS

187
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:53,386
>> CHE CAN BUSINESS

188
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:53,420

>> CAN ANY BUSINESS IS

191
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:55,689
INTERESTED IN EQUITY AND

192
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,324
BUILDING A NEW INDUSTRY

193
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,558
THAT'S DIVERSE AND GIVE BACK

194
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,293
