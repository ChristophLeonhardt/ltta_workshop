what do you think a president Trump going after dr. Ford personally like this well you know when you think about it he's going after a 15 year old girl for not coming forward about a really traumatic event in her life and what's so telling about that is you know is a real ignorant of trauma of this kind this is not reported by most women who experienced that I think it's much as 65 percent of women never tell anyone and and you know I've had that really underline this week because just this week I have had a significant number of women everywhere that I go tell me they had similar experiences and many of them said that they've never spoken about it before this week so I think there's a this is really hitting a nerve with a lot of women right now when you heard this story developed when dr. Ford made her claim her allegation that the Cavanagh corralled her into a room jumped on top of a rubbed against her when she started to yell or whatever he covered her mouth with his hand writ rough stuff by anybody stand this is beyond whatever beyond the normal have a couple beers and making it passive somebody this is rough stuff this how did that fit with your memory of parties that you went to back in those days and hold norms in it Georgetown Prep well I mean certainly they get out of hand yeah well you know they typically got out of hand in the same way they probably got out of hand when you were in high school or kids today are in high school so this is admirin by any measure I think that I think that that there is some credence the idea that these all-male schools are a little rougher a little more aggressive and perhaps a little more rowdy as we're calling it but this instance as described by dr. Ford does that step out of the norm you experience this seems criminal right at least people say a misdemeanor at least right you know I'd like to answer that a category as a categorical yes was unusual but as I said mmm there are enough women that I know who experienced this in high school and since that I don't think it was as unusual as we would hope what about when you hear from dr. Ford now what she's going through how she's preparing for what might be might be testimony next week I don't know exactly how she's preparing I've been really communicated as I think her sister-in-law pointed out she's really kept her circle the communications pretty small but I have been communicating with the people who are communicating with her and I think that she's starting to you know this came about her her letting her name out came about pretty quickly so she didn't have time to prepare I think she's had some time now to to take a deep breath and get her head on and I'm hoping that by the time we see her she will be the in full strength how important is it that she speak at testify it's important would you testify I think at this point I would hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
