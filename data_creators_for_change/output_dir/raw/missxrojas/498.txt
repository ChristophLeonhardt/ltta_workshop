as John is coinage is something that I

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,869
feel very strongly about specifically

13
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,140
how us coinage makes no debts I've got

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,689
the liberty of emptying out my hardest

<font color="#E5E5E5">idea what to do with cuz I just don't</font>

17
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,640
understand them so let's start with a

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,700
penny<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which I have many the dime is</font>

19
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,969
smaller than penny but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay 5p</font>

20
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,460
coin in the UK is smaller than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1p</font>

21
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,960
coin there are different<font color="#E5E5E5"> materials</font>

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,100
that's really noticeable it would a

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,360
fuller naturally<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be the</font>

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,789
lowest value silvery coin it's a dime

25
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,649
which apparently means that it's ten

26
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,280
cents now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nickel which is five</font>

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,710
cents the nickel is both thicker and

28
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,140
bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a dime where's the sense in</font>

29
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,780
that the quarter the 25 cents makes

30
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,809
sense big it's noticeable it's shiny

31
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,119
it's generally quite a sensible coin but

32
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,710
