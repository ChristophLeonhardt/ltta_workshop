Hi friends so I'm from Wisconsin where
we put cheese on our heads
cheese on our money cheese on our cheese
I even come from dairy farms on my dad's
side so at this point what runs through
my veins is just liquid gruy√®re
I don't tell you this to like upset
vegans I still love you
vegans I just tell you this because I
didn't realize just how much of an
impact moldy milk has had on my life
so you know when you had to sell
magazines or candy or wrapping paper and
grade schools of fundraiser
well in true wisco fashion my school
sold cheese people went bananas for that
cheese
we sold bricks upon bricks upon bricks
of it
I still have the American Girl doll that
I want as a prize for spelling so much
as proof
so one day when we had a school in
service my dad decided to keep my
brother and I entertain by driving us up
to Belgium Wisconsin to see where they
made the cheese
I was maybe eight years old still in the
stage where I insisted on wearing the
same purple polar fleece every single
day
not yet too cool to enjoy driving over
the rolling hills of Wisconsin with my
dad to learn how cheese was made and
like most small towns in Wisconsin
they're just several independent cheese
shops just dotting the highway and from
the outside Cedar Valley cheese looks
like just any other one of them but as
soon as my dad tipped them off that
we're from that one school that moves
their cheese like professionals they
treated us like we were celebrities
we got to go behind the scenes and cv
big metal box of Milk getting all enzyme
dup and separating into curds and whey
I may have even gotten to sneak a few
fresh squeakers they give us all the
cheese samples that my little stomach
could take and at the end of the tour
I even got a little cow shaped beanie
baby that sat on my shoulder the entire
ride home
it remains one of the best afternoons of
my life and it was only one of the first
times that a cheese related incident
gave me comfort
like when I first considered moving to
Seattle and went out to visit a little
bit rattled in the sea tac airport on
the way home
I spotted a local cheese kiosk with a
sign on the counter that said what our
cheese curds
it was a massive dose of culture shock
to me like what
there are people who don't know there
are people in this world that have not
experienced nature's freshest squeakiest
most perfect form of cheese
I couldn't stop laughing and yet the
thought but there was a place where I
could get fresh cheese curds made it
start to seem like this was a place I
could actually live in a couple of weeks
ago when I was having panic attacks over
cacti
I found an about in franchise of a
Midwestern fast food chain that sells
greasy deep-fried wisconsin cheese curds
they're not like squeaky fresh but for
the next five months bill do you know
it's like a Lorelai Gilmore has that
thing with snow that whenever it shows
up something wonderful happens
that's what it's like for me except
cheese so I want to know in the comments
is there any kind of food that is
somehow inextricably tied to your
identity and if you liked this video you
