15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,149
way be my first plan was to make the

no more dream or eggs and module eggs

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,739
are expensive right now you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">noticed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world economy is</font>

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,120
crashing and while America is recovering

21

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,449

<font color="#CCCCCC">parents probably wouldn't let me and</font>

to enjoy myself right now which I am to

85
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,130
