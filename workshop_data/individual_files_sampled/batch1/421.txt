it sparked protests and social media campaigns the case of a judge accused of sexual misconduct but the US president is standing by his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Donald Trump actually thinks the controversy could be a vote winner so how will it affect the upcoming midterm elections this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Mohammed Jim Jim the Brett Kavanaugh case has divided America Donald Trump's pick for a lifetime job on the top US Court is accused of sexual misconduct there was already a lot at stake Cavanaugh's appointment would likely tip the Supreme Court to the right with huge implications for a whole range of social cultural and political issues but there may be more immediate consequences at next month's midterm elections allegations that the judge sexually assaulted a student while at college have prompted angry protests with claims Cavanaugh's not fit to sit on America's highest court if that translates into votes in the November poll it could swing Congress to the Democrats undercutting Trump's legislative agenda the controversy has prompted one former Supreme Court justice who initially backed Cavanaugh's nomination to change his mind John Paul Stevens now says Kavanagh might not have the right temperament for the job his performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind I think there's as several commentators Larry tribe among them whose account of constitutional law professor at Harvard at Harvard have written written pieces in which they suggest that he has alienated he has demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants here before the court that he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and I think there's merit in that that Krita so and that the senator should really pay attention to it for the good of the court so just how did we get here in July Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace a retiring Supreme Court justice last month accusations against Kavanagh by dr. Christine Blasi Ford surfaced in a Washington Post article she accused him of sexually assaulting her at a college party in the early 1980s both Ford and Kavanagh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee for detailed her claims Kavanagh denied them the White House then gave the FBI one week to investigate the agency's report was sent to the White House and the Senate Republicans are pressing ahead hoping to get Kavanagh installed before next month's midterm elections all right now to our panel of guests in Washington DC jeff Hauser executive director of the revolving door project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research Rina Shah a conservative commentator and Republican strategist and consultant and John neffenger a Democratic strategist and former communications director at the at the Democratic National Committee welcome to you all and thanks for joining us today John let me start with you what does it say about the damage this may have done or may do to the reputation of the Supreme Court that former Justice John Paul Stevens now says judge Kavanagh might not have the right temperament for the job yeah Mohammed the Supreme Court has always been political but it's important for the credibility of the court for the integrity of really our entire system of government that we'd be able to see them as our Supreme Court justices as people who do aspire to look beyond partisan fights and uphold a higher vision of the law what justice Kavanagh did at his hearing last week literally threatening Democratic senators saying what comes around goes around it was unprecedented unbelievable accusing him accusing Democrats of of taking revenge for the Clintons it really does politicize the court in a way that I don't think we've ever seen before now trust in government is a more sacred thing for Democrats in general they are the party that believes the government should be able to get things done whereas Republicans since Ronald Reagan have been dining out on this idea that that government can't get anything done so in a sense there's a larger benefit to the larger Republican project but just in terms of the integrity of our court and the integrity of our government it could do immense damage arena had Republicans or President Trump withdrawn this nomination would this fight from your perspective still be playing out the way that it is it most certainly wouldn't look when justice Gorsuch was going through this very same process Democrats supported him we know three Democrats went through and voted for him and he had no such allegations of sexual misconduct arise I don't think it's too much to ask Republicans in the Senate to put forth and vote for somebody that doesn't have these allegations against him such as judge Cavanaugh look this goes back to a problem here the boys will be boys thing and it's it's something that sort of arisen because of the me2 movement here in the United States this the actions that Judge Cavanaugh is being alleged to have partaken in or from when he was a teen and when he was a collegiate a young college guy at Yale of all places so this is something I I'm really very saddened to see play out this way in 2018 I thought we would believe women and that we would probably put forward someone else Jeff regardless of how this is playing out publicly it privately how concerned our Republican lawmakers about judge Cavanaugh's temperament unfortunately I think the bulk of them may not be that concerned I think that Brett Kavanaugh was chosen by Donald Trump to be a partisan figure the fact that Brett Cavanaugh was partisan was not revealed for the first time last week this is a man who was one of the senior lieutenants to Ken Starr in the 1990s when Bill Clinton the impeachment effort against Bill Clinton was underway he's someone who's involved in the contested presidential election of 2000 as a lawyer he's been involved in partisan fights with Democrats for more than 20 years in Washington DC and president Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh knowing that there are potential constitutional crises coming down the line with the robber molar special prosecution of Trump and his ties to Russia in the 2016 election and various other fights and Trump put up Brett Kavanaugh to be a partisan ally and I think the vast majority of Republican senators were fine with that and his nomination looked like it was gonna pass up and until these allegations arose and of course it's still May alright president Trump clearly doesn't think any of this will hurt his party's chances in November in fact he believes the controversy will actually benefit the Republicans he tweeted the harsh and unfair treatment of judge Brett Kavanaugh is having an incredible upward impact on voters that people get it far better than the politicians most importantly this great life cannot be ruined by mean and despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations Reena let me ask you what do you think when you hear that I mean at the beginning of this saga President Trump seemed to be by his standard somewhat restrained he'd even said that the testimony that was offered by dr. Blasi Ford was credible now you see this onslaught you see this mockery and you see tweets like this what does that say about where this process is well number one nobody should be surprised at the fact that he mocked a woman who's alleging that she was assaulted sexually it's a very very low and despicable moment for the state of public affairs in this country when when we see this happening but when he was a candidate he mocked a disabled reporter so while I'm saddened by it I'm not surprised I I will say this the president when he was a candidate and into the time he took the Oval Office to this day has nearly 20 allegations of sexual misconduct against him clearly he does not respect women American voters who voted for President Trump know this they have no problem with it they don't they have no problem with his misogyny more than anything else and so when he took to the the rally pulpit last week and and mocked her it was a moment where he sort of mobilized his base to say midterm elections matter to us get out and and express how angry you are with how this innocent man has been treated the the phrase that the right is using right now particularly women on the right are saying that Cavanaugh was not given due process what they are forgetting as that Senate judiciary committee hearings are not a court of law and while they say they believe dr. Ford they're not sure that she was they able to corroborate and essentially prove that it was Brett Kavanaugh who assaulted her and that's what President Trump railed against saying that she basically could not be trusted and wasn't credible whereas just a few days prior he had tweeted saying she was credible he's a flip-flopper John there are Democratic lawmakers who have been suggesting that Judge Cavanaugh may have perjured himself not just in this round of testimony but in previous rounds of testimony for the confirmation of other judges yeah if if there is this blue wave in November if Democrats were to retake the house and possibly even the Senate even though there's a much narrower path to that and many are saying it's unlikely sure do you believe that Democratic lawmakers would try to open more investigations into Judge Cavanaugh and possibly even have him impeached yeah absolutely I don't think the likelihood have been being impeached in this climate in the sense sorry impeachment is a is a funny term and what this comes up with a president Trump and now with judge Cavanaugh because the vote to impeach to get the process underway I think very well could happen because I think the Democratic base would demand it of people this is not just a political moment anymore this is a cultural moment we have depending on whose stats you believe something like 40 million American women who've been the victim of sexual violence and so this is personal in a way that that we don't see most political issues playing out so yes I do think he he has given lots of testimony that conflicts with documentary evidence I do think you could see that pursued although because of the tribalism that we see no matter how big this blue wave is mathematically you're you're gonna need Republicans in the Senate to be able to actually remove someone whether it's Cavanaugh or Trump from office and I don't see that necessarily happening very easily although you know with with conclusive proof of of lying maybe maybe you could pry a couple of Republicans off too Jeff let me ask you when it comes to the midterms do you see all this play more favorably to the advantage of the Democrats at this point or the Republicans I think the conventional wisdom is that it's going to be mixed and it sort of depends on the the nature of the race and who are the key voters Republicans have been saying since this began that their base is enthusiastic and that there's gonna be higher turnout I don't think Democrats were expecting to win because Republicans failed to vote I think they were more Democrats were expecting to win because their base which tends to not vote in midterm elections tends to only vote in presidential elections was in fact excited so I think you're gonna see both bases performing well the big question remains how is this going to be seen by those voters who maybe are traditionally Republican but are turned off by Trump and I would think that ultimately speaking those more moderate Republican voters are going to potentially vote Democratic now because Brett Kavanaugh is underscoring the qualms they may have about Donald Trump as a person and because he personifies so many of the same problems with treating women not only respectfully but avoiding physical assault so I think in the end it might help Democrats but Republicans are certainly claiming to the contrary and I don't know that we know one month from now how it will play out Arena last week there was this incredibly dramatic five or six men as a video that captured Senator Jeff Flake being cornered in that elevator by these two women who were sexual assault survivors what I'm curious about is at that point Jeff Flake indicated that he was going to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and then after that he called for this FBI investigation do you believe that it was the fact that that was captured on video that really changed the calculus of where he stood in all of this I do agree with that because when lawmakers see the the real I guess you can say more than anything else the attention that social media tends to give to these important decisions in a way that that there was not before there's some degree of change there and what he did was call for the FBI investigation and said he couldn't really move forward without that happening but look he's a political animal as well he's not running for re-election so in my in my gut I know that Jeff Flake knows that he doesn't he can make these tough choices and he doesn't have anything to lose but this is how our system works so what he did was essentially give himself cover to vote yes to say that there was an investigation and that this investigation brought forth pretty much nothing which is what we're hearing from senator Grassley the head of the committee and so it gives them cover to essentially vote YES on Kavanagh because something was done and that's that's really all that moment did I was hoping for a little bit more but even to get to that point the pressures that come from from having been captured on video I think got to him and and but again in the end made him make a political decision that I don't think moved the needle very much John what about the fact that there have been these really large protests in in Washington DC I mean they were there were these huge protests in the heart Senate building on Thursday where there were hundreds if not thousands of women that were you know confronting senators at men as well do you think that lawmakers in Washington have been completely surprised by the outpouring when it comes to this by the emotion involved by the by the number of protesters that have been confronting them or do you think that they've been expecting this more and more considering how all of this is really dividing along partisan lines well I I hope so because I went down and protested on Monday and got myself arrested doing this too I think there is an unusual moment that's the first time in my life that I've done anything like that and I think that you see more and more people stepping up and saying this is just not OK for various different reasons many of them very personal and I think you saw that come through with the video of the women at the elevators the survivors there and I do think that there is this this human outpouring of emotion and this human to human connection that that is at least letting the Senators know that even if they do go ahead and make their political calculations the same way they would have without it that there's gonna be this is gonna last in the American memory that this is this is going to be a moment that's not just a political moment and the Republican Party right now is that in danger of defining itself as the party of sex criminals for a generation obviously Democrats have not been totally innocent in that area in the past but they're making strides to get rid of that and the Republican Party now as we see with with Donald Trump doubling down on this guy who he himself admitted was very credible is is essentially embracing this very old patriarchal attitude that certainly next generations of voters young voters are not okay with at all Jeff what about what about this FBI investigation I mean were you surprised that at the last minute it was actually called for I was not surprised that it was called for because it always represented a kind of obvious way for the center of this Senate to neither immediately vote no or yes and the US Senate always likes to prefer to postpone decisions and so the FBI decision the FBI investigation was a logical thing for the voters in the center to demand what's been very disappointing is that their demand was far too vague it was an FBI investigation at the direction of President Trump himself as the other guests have pointed out credibly accused of sexual assault and as you might imagine Trump did not tell the FBI to actually talk to the witnesses who could have corroborated Debora Ramirez and dr. Christine Baazi Ford's allegations so there is an absence of top-level corroborating evidence but it's because the FBI was expressly told to not find that evidence so unfortunately the FBI investigation which was a reasonable step turned out to not be a real investigation and as a result it's really just a sham that's a shame and I wish that the people would call for it a week ago had been much more specific when they had made that call Reno what about the what about Republican voters in the United States right now I mean are they split along is it along gender lines right now is it the never Trump pers and and those that are that for Trump I mean where does this put the Republican voter when it comes to the midterms what's been going on when it comes to Brett Cavanaugh's confirmation well many would argue that never Trump has been dead and I've been part of that movement since day one having been called the poster girl for it when I lost my delegate seat for speaking out against the current president however look here's the thing there is a faction of the Republican Party that is given in to everything that the president says they believe that everything he's saying is truth that is the mag of faction and they they will do anything to support him anything he says is is again like I said propped up his truth and so there is another set of us that is concerned about the future of democracy worried about this partisanship that marks this era of politics in Washington and and we just hope that there would be principled leaders who could stand up we had hope we'd find them in Lindsey Graham in Jeff Flake in Susan Collins in Lisa Murkowski but at the end of the day these are political animals who have to run for re-election and people do like their seats I'm a proponent of term limits I I don't know how many Republicans have this very moment support that but what it does indicate to me this current climate is that Republicans who support the president feel that judge Kavanagh is being wronged and they are worried about their sons I've heard as I've talked to many Republican women about them being falsely accused I think it's a bunch of malarkey a drunk that Josh Kavanagh should have been withdrawn and that was where we should have left it it's sorry to have interrupted you I thought you were done there Reena Jon you heard Reena just just mentioned term limits and that actually brings me to my next question because you know there are more and more people in the u.s. that that are expressing an opinion that Supreme Court justices should not be appointed for life and there are lawmakers that have espoused that view as well is there any chance that in the coming few years in the coming few decades from your point of view there could be a movement or there could be lawmakers that could come to some sort of bipartisan consensus that would try to limit the terms for Supreme Court justices bipartisan consensus very elusive these days I think but then again the idea that Donald Trump would be in the White House was inconceivable a couple years ago and I do think that that there's gonna be a very serious conversation now about the makeup of the court because as we talked about before it's not gonna be seen as legitimate the way it is especially with this guy on it if he ends up on it but in general I think both parties are have real difficulty with the confirmation process right now nobody is enjoying what's going on in Washington right now and it clearly doesn't make sense or inspire confidence in our Supreme Court or judiciary in general and so I do think you're gonna see a real conversation what form that takes what proposals come out I think is a little premature to say yet but yeah the the very existence and functioning of the Supreme Court there is now in serious question the way it works Jeff this is playing out 27 years after Anita Hills testimony this is playing out during the me2 era I mean what does it say about the state of play in the United States that this is happening right now I mean that you can look at it you can be optimistic or you can be pessimistic the optimist would point out that most polls show either more people believe dr. bazi for it as I do then judge Kavanagh or it's tied but I think the consensus is most people believe dr. Bazzi for and that was not the case in 1991 at the time the strong majority supported Clarence Thomas and he was ultimately confirmed with the support of the American people if Cavanaugh is to be confirmed in 2018 he's going to be confirmed basically because the Republicans just listen to their base which is a diminishing minority of Americans so it basically says that there's been progress but that progress has certainly has many many more miles to go that we need much more progress we need to believe women and we're not there fully as a society powerful institutions do not believe women but some progress has been made so I would caution against being too pessimistic or too optimistic rina we only have about two minutes left here so please just be mindful of that how much has all this done damage to the credibility of the Supreme Court and how much has all of this done damage to the credibility of the you know I think the trust that younger Americans will have in our institutions is is going to greatly diminish after these midterm elections there's just no refuting that because when we see peaceful protests that has happened many times since President Trump took office and and the games don't seem to be made that really erodes the trust of Millennials like myself where we believe that when you elect somebody to represent you they take all facts into consideration when we look at what seems to be a good old boys club and remains as such in 2018 where we're making great strides in other fields women overwhelmingly are more educated than men in the United States have higher degrees rather and where we've taken a place in the workforce that is so different but we don't see that reflected women are underrepresented in today's US Congress the numbers are so bleak and so I think to both men and women it will make sense that why should we trust these institutions if they don't change for us when we get out and we peacefully protest and we vote so there at some point will be a shake-up all right we have run out of time so thanks to all our guests Jeff Hauser Rena Shaw and John neffenger and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website aljazeera.com and for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me Mohammed Jim Jim and the whole team here bye for now you
