a poignant example the administration of Ariston in the homs province reported that over the course of three months which have elapsed since the liberation of the city around 1500 locals have returned there and in the neighbouring tabbies city the population grew from five thousand to twelve thousand as a returnees kept coming back home now moving on to a different topic which has been discussed everywhere for a week now that is the death of Russian journalists in the Central African Republic we receive a lot of requests and we are analyzing a great number of publications and we will keep you updated as we get any new information we are currently verifying the updates and now we have something to share on the 7th of August employees of the Russian embassy in the Central African Republic met the leaders of the Central African Republic national gendarmerie the local law enforcement told the Russian German Russian diplomats about the new facts established over the course of the investigation and also they have talked to their driver of the journalists who is the surviving witness of the tragedy and according to the driver on the 28th of July the Russian journalist met him in one of the cafes in bangy and offered him to drive them around in his personal car over the course of ten days the next day the journalist made their attempt to infiltrate the Berenger training camp where Russian instructors are training Central African military men however they did not have any permission any journalists credentials and as well as any permission from the Ministry of Defense of the Central African Republic to visit the site so they were turned away by the Central African soldiers guarding the camp on the 30th of July around 11 o'clock the journalists headed to the city of Bunbury situated to the north of the Central African capital in the city of Gemara which is 70 kilometers away from monkey they stopped and over the course of an hour and a half they were shooting some footage and talking to the locals and after that without explaining anything the journalist decided to deviate from their initial itinerary and asked the driver to take them to Dakar once they arrived to Sibiu which is halfway to Dakar that was around 6:30 p.m. their car was stopped by the Central African military patrol which recommended them not to proceed any further and spent the night in Cebu because beyond the city the territory beyond the control the government starts although the journalists insisted to pursue their cause of action and they said that they were in a hurry it has also been established that their desire to proceed with their journey and not to follow the recommendations all these facts were a point of a heated argument but nevertheless they let them go as for the crime itself the driver repeats the version he previously stated that is the attack of armed assailants on the road to decora between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. so this is what's happened in the evening and the law-enforcement bodies of the Central African Republic I can their investigation important clue might be the laptop any data storages as well as the mobile phone of one of the journalists with the Russian and Central African SIM cards currently we are requesting the local mobile operator to provide us with information on calls and messages sent from this phone in response to the request of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation the director of the National gendarmerie of Central African Republic confirmed to have embassy in Bunge that the Central African law-enforcement bodies are open and ready to cooperate with the Russian investigators they are also ready to welcome them in the Central African Republic and create all the necessary condition for their further work including ensuring their safety once they visit the site of the tragedy we see that the Central African authorities are ready to cooperate with Russia in order to determine what happened so we express our satisfaction as to how our current cooperation isn't going with the Central African Republic authorities I would also like to highlight the fact that we previously underscored we keep this situation under our control and we will keep you updated on any new developments in the investigation of course in close cooperation with the Russian law enforcement bodies we are also following situation with Maria Putin who was arrested on the 15th of July and charged with being a foreign agent Russia is undertaking all the possible measures to make mr. Medin Bhutanese stay in prison as convenient as possible because she was faced with blatant discrimination on the part of the American authorities she's openly subjected to psychological pressure searches are carried out regularly in her cell she is not provided with medical aid Maura well various restrictions are being introduced against her while not against other detainees it's evident that this is nothing but an attempt to make Maria Bettina plead guilty it is also evident that all the allegations are Hollow it is also evident that there's a political element to this case they are trying to mace this case on the messages and social media taken out of context in this regard we asked to immediately stop the criminal proceedings against Maria Buettner who is a victim of the interim internal political wars in the United States and to liberate her and we will protect her legitimate interests as she's a Russian Russian citizen we were also concerned about new detentions last week Maxim suberin was detained as well as Nikolay to peek in Alexei Navalny and stanislav the sit ski and they were charged with fraud and money laundering as part of the organized criminal group our Embassy in Washington asked the State Department to clarify the situation by the Consulate General in New York contacted the local office of the FBI and met Maxime suberin who is kept in a Cell right now we are currently trying to determine where other detainees are being held and we are trying to organize a consular meeting with them we are following the situation in that same time we are taking all the possible measures to defend their rights and legitimate interests of our citizens unfortunately once again I have to go back to the introduction of new sanctions against Russia just yesterday the State Department announced a new portion of sanctions and this time the pretext for this is the poisoning of scribbles the leaders of our country are being directly accused of using military nerve agent Novacek against them although and I would like to highlight that Britain has not been able to provide any evidence to support their view that Russia was involved in the events in Salisbury moreover they are refusing to cooperate with Russia in the investigation nevertheless despite the lack of any evidence the American administration using some sort of Union Solidarity pretexts decided to introduce a new package of sanctions the list of sanctions which are to enter into force on the 22nd of August we see a ban to provide any foreign assistance except for humanitarian assistance to sell any kind of military and dual-use goods to refuse to grant loans and other financial aid as a condition to leave the sanctions they are making absolutely unacceptable demands and this is just the first step and they threaten to ramp up the sanction pressure even further so the united states are following the path of deteriorating our bilateral relationships although these relationships are at the lowest point as of now and despite trying to find some ways to better the relationships as was discussed during the recent summit and Helsinki the United States administration is now doing everything in their power in order to complicate the situation even further those who sponsored this new developments in this spin of the screep our case want to try this topic afloat and to further demonize and Mar Russia this is an attempt to present our state as a state which does not comply with its international obligations in this particular case the obligations under the seat you see although everyone is well aware that last year Russia has fully eliminated its stock of chemical weapons in strict compliance with the CWC Convention and unlike the Americans who have not yet completely eliminated their own chemical Arsenal and keep postponing it against this backdrop of this allegations are baseless and cynical Russia has warned multiple times that using force and using ultimatums when talking with us is futile Russia is going to develop a response to this very hostile will step on the part of Washington and once again against this backdrop their assurances coming from the American administration they are ready to keep battering the relationship with Russia seem hypocritic unfortunately their actions justify that they are not ready to do that and we are off the impression that the United States and their allies who are promoting this decision are now adhering to a new behavioral model when they're making all kinds of allegations against Russia which are absolutely baseless and hollow I would also like to say just to tell you a little bit about how those decisions were made in response to the direct question to the representative of the State Department from Russian representatives regarding the investigation in Salisbury no response followed so this whole pyramid of allegations is being constructed without any legal basis and they are talking about international law and and hearing to legal norms etc etc as well as fulfilling your obligations so in response to the direct question where the investigation is going what is the current status there was no response at all they did not find anything to say in response and it is evident that the law-enforcement bodies do not like to comment anything but that's a remarkable case nevertheless it was not the only step undertaken by the American administration recently for example the new economic sanctions against China and the renewal of sanctions against Iran I'm going to mention that in detail very soon it seems that the American establishment is now going rampant we've received a lot of questions regarding the unilateral sanctions against Iran our assessment of that in our possible steps I would like to remind you that the president of the United States signed the order on the 6th of August to reestablished the Iranian sanctions in two stages they were lifted in 2016 due to the signing of the jcpoa and in the process of developing of which united states took an active part and they talked how important at all it was first restrictions entered into force on August the 7th and they concerned financial and banking sector of the Islamic Republic and also Goods and civil aviation the second wave is planned for November the 5th and it should strike the oil and energy sectors of Iran this steps have ex territorial nature and this means that imply that persons and companies of third countries that cooperate with Iran will also fall under this and Washington has it has been underscored that Washington is talking about the Iranian nuclear program and is this renewal of pressure on the Iran is there just octave undertaken this step is against the opinion of the majority of countries and the United States are following their own agenda and their geopolitical interests and not talking and we're not talking about national just national interests we are talking about the interests of a certain group of of certain lobbyists which are conducting this policy at this stage what is more we also see a blatant breach of international law for example the resolution 2231 of the Security Council of the United Nations and nobody in the United States haven't even considered featuring at the time and it's obvious that all of this activity is just a wall of smoke to cover their real political agenda and the ignore interest of other countries including the European allies they're basically just twisting their arms and forcing them to break those mutually beneficial trade and economic cooperation with Iran and I would like to remind you that after this agreement this joint comprehensive plan was concluded a segment of the EU and I'm talking about business and financial operators reoriented towards a beneficial market and this were long-term plans obviously this actions on the American part will have negative consequences for the global non-proliferation regime as well as well give negative or disturb lysing spin to the situation in the Middle East on its part the Russian Federation is still is true to the joint comprehensive plan and will base its actions on the real resolution 2231 of the Security Council of the United Nations and we know that other parties to this plan of the same opinion and we should but that this nuclear do is so poor although it today is present political discussions deal plan of action or agreement is not so used but actually we're talking about an international legal document about the resolution of a Security Council which has completely legitimized this document nevertheless we talk about nuclear deal we should all remember that this nuclear deal is a legacy of the entire international community which has on multiple occasions underscored that it's important to keep it and to implement it on the long term basis in order to strengthen the international and regional peace and security as well as the non-proliferation regime now going back to the topic of Nova choc Salisbury aims three I'd like to say a few words about this topic in British media we see that there is a new spin to this information and propaganda game that has been launched by the official London there are many versus many hypotheses put forward and when official London is claiming that Russia is trying to mix all those versions but yet they are presenting about 20 versions themselves we try to count how many versions have been presented by the British media we're not talking about dozens we're talking about hundreds of versions sub versions hypothesis the situation is completely tangled it's obvious that the journalists stay up on this topic and it's clear why but the most important for us is the official version of the investigation authorities and of course it's made under the political pressure and the aim of it as well instead is to conduct the investigation in accordance with the accusations presented by the political leadership of the country soon after the incident you know it was this Western Dogma that there should be no pressure on investigation there should be no pressure on the law enforcement agencies can you imagine what law enforcement employees feel when they work in the UK tried to investigate this case and as we understand try to get to the bottom of what has happened all of a sudden they see how Washington is adopting a whole package of measures which our embassy has called draconian those measures against Russia and all of this is done because supposedly Russia Russian government or as they say Russia in general as a country is involved in this crime what kind of distance distance between Polish politics and law enforcement agency agencies can we talk about if this most powerful country and which has protective is exerting Protectorate over the UK is making such steps this is direct pressure on the investigation process and moreover it's a kind of psychological pressure on those very people that everyday tried to meticulously recreate the state the events perfectly understand that those police men those investigators researchers representatives of the other law enforcement agencies perfectly understand that without any trace against a whole country there's been a accusation verdict what can possibly happen to those ordinary policemen that might make a decision which would not follow in the mainstream can you imagine what this person feels when they come back home sit in their kitchen after a day of work can you imagine this of course this is a psychological pressure psychological pressure on the person participating in the investigation and the foreign secretary of the UK mr. hunter said that on the streets of the UK there's been a use of chemical weapons and they suppose that has been made by Russian Russians of course this follows in the stream of political and psychological pressure exerted by the politicians that have some power of the law-enforcement agencies recently at London police has published first first in three weeks statement on the incident in Aylesbury which testifies to the ongoing work on determining the affected places and items and that they will be working with the chemical laboratory in Porton Down it's like there's this circle this carousel which British politicians and law enforcement agencies are stuck in and all of this is concerning this mysterious portent on the board tree and there is no way out of this carousel of this circle and since in Salisbury there were Russian citizens affected affected for us it's a matter of principle that the investigation be independent objective and transparent and Russian law enforcement agencies are still ready to provide all necessary assistance in this process we have also noted that recent has been a publication of the work of Porton Down and their financial reports for years 2017-2018 we have already commented on this and now we have even more questions the incidents in Salisbury has been covered very briefly and exclusively in fact if this can be described in facts I guess the backdrop of this information boom in mass media as far as the identification of the substance used in Salisbury and the results of the OPCW analysis there is not a single word in this document and head of the laboratory mr. 1/10 has noted that soles brilliant there was a nice I quote a newer political attack and of quote however he refused to uncover any detail referencing and I quote unfinished investigation and nada quote interests of national security so what can we see while the political forces in Washington and London adopting new measures again and again with a perfect understanding for what's happened they're experts and specialists which are directly involved in the investigation and whose competence it is to determine those issues are talking about an unconverted investigation talking about the secrecy of this whole thing and refused to use any specific formulations regarding this topic the majority of the incidents registered in 2017-2018 are concerned the cases of high potential or real threat to the security of the organization and against the decrease in the indices of the funds of the lab or she might testify to deficiencies in the technical and not just human resources matter and is it a coincident that incidents with scruples and also the british did a british subjects in eastery happened in vicinity of the chemical laboratory important down we think that we need to gain to obtain answers to these questions from the investigation and the activity of the important down the board she should stay in the focus of the investigation and since the bridge site and the fact that bridge side is referencing a sama interest of national security is irrelevant and you have to take responsibility in front of the international community for your actions and you have to give the questions of the international community and those questions have been made a long time ago so we insist that the British authorities uncover the data on the work of the Laporte regarding the synthesis of new of war agents which in the West are now called Nova chalk agents we have also paid close attention to the publication of a British newspaper Daily Telegraph which is making a new attempt to cast shadow of doubt of the post-mortem analysis of the death of a Russian citizen mr. Paresh name the interest to this topic on the part of the British media which competes in proposing different hypotheses is now clear for us to large extent has been provoked by the fact that investigation partially has been conducted yes in behind closed doors and and British authorities once again decided to classify the materials of this case for the reasons of national security of the United Kingdom in other words everything which can be subject to specific questions made by experts is immediately classified because this is a matter of national security of the United Kingdom lack of reasonable transparency in the investigation of this case and information vacuum obviously very quickly full filled by the media you know this is a case of you scratch my back I scratch yours and they try to give clearly anti-russian spin to this case and we think it's unacceptable and we insist on an objective and independent conclusion of this investigation moving on to a different topic a different region sedation with Kiril Wyszynski is still the same of the curstyn court has prolonged his detention to September the 20th although the Russian consulate employees have been refused to meet with a detainee with reference to his Ukrainian citizenship the Embassy of Russia in Ukraine and general consulate in Odessa monitor the situation and provide support to the defense of the detainee and now another topic coming back to the region with which we started we have talked about the plans to organize in Geneva on the 6th the interim any talks which spin around the armed conflict and aimed at strengthening in the mutual understanding mutual trust and undertaking further steps for political settlement in Yemen and we hope that the special envoy of the secretary-general mr Griffiths will make some progress and Moscow is always supporting and will support any undertakings aimed at transfer the situation from a military confrontation to a peaceful resolution and providing help to the Yemeni citizens and talk about the political solution for the country and would like to remind that this consultations will be the first in two years between the Yemeni protagonists we hope that this context will not follow in the footsteps of the previous rounds that took place in Geneva mascot bill el Kuwait and that there would be maximum results specific results and that only a minister they will finally be achieved peace and stability situation around the Gaza once again deteriorated on on the 7th of August two fighters were killed by the tag church and on the 8th and 9th from Gaza to Israeli territory there were 150 missiles and shells launched and as a result two Israelites and a citizen of Thailand suffered and infrastructure or for the Israeli settler settlements next to Gaza were under the strike the mass media inform about the death of three Palestinians which includes a pregnant woman and her 18 month old infant and maaske was concerned with the this ongoing escalation and since May the tensions along the Israel and Gaza border have been on the rise and we see a confrontation around this sector which threatens with new victims among the civil population and dramatic decrease in the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian on cloth we once again call upon Palestinians and Israelites to be moderate and undertake measure to avoid recurrences of violence with unpredictable consequences and we have already mentioned that in order to get out of this vicious circle of military confrontation that should as soon as possible establish a negotiations process regarding the two-state solution based on the existing resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly of the United Nations as well as the Arab Peace Initiative any unilateral solutions which go around the existing international legal base for Middle Eastern settlements will not forward this cause another region on the August 5th around 7:00 p.m. on the Isle of Lombok lesser Sunda Islands took place an earthquake of seven in magnitude and about 130 persons according to preliminary statistics died and about 1,500 people were wounded there was a serious blow to the housing funds as well as the energy and transportation infrastructure partial damage was done to the airports of the islands long back in Bali which led to temporary hold in their work and presently the air communal communication of these airports is conducted as normal and there are no Russian citizens among the deceased in wounded and the Russian embassy in Jakarta sent to this region to the island long book a diplomatic worker and we are monitoring this station in the region our employee is conducting work to determine or work to understand well there's been any Russian citizens among the victims and also provides all the possible assistance on the online sources of our mission abroad we provide contact information now which citizens can use 24/7 there we have contact phone numbers and please use them to contact our citizens in the region to inform our cities of the region moving on to the situation in Venezuela on August 5th in its statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia decisively condemned the recent assassination attempt against the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and we are glad that he was unharmed and the multiple warnings coming from Caracas on the attempt to murder the Venezuelan leader were not baseless but such a sophisticated murder attempt with the use of modern technologies and such a public attempt on his life as well is aimed is clearly aimed at destabilizing the situation in the country there is no doubt about the terrorist texts of this murder attempt it is absolutely absolutely inappropriate to use these methods on the part of the Venezuelan intergovernmental forces because such methods are a threat to the security and stable development of both in Isola and of the whole Latin American community we hope that in instigation would hold all the culprits responsible as well as find the financing channels for this crime and we believe that the relevant international structures who are mandated to counter the financing of terrorist activities are going to pay their utmost attention to this crime according to our embassy in Caracas the situation in the country remains calm and we wish speedy recovery to all those injured in the attack we have mentioned several times that NATO is a useless organization and once again our words were confirmed including the recent incident with the NATO aircraft which patrolled the Baltic region the military activities of NATO close to Russian borders under you advised pretext of protecting themselves against the mythical Russian threat is a cause for concern on the 7th of August the air over Estonia saw the NATO aircraft belonging to Spain which was patrolling the airspace this aircraft fired an air-to-air missile by mistake and this was to be expected because now at the initiative of NATO this previously calm region in military sense is now turning into a zone of intense military and training activities which might lead to dangerous accidents and this is good that this missile did not hit for example a passenger airplane these events once again showed that NATO's activities including in the Baltic create additional security risks but they are not serving to strengthen the security it's evident that we need to take real steps aimed escalating the tensions and reporting any unwanted incidents but not multiplying any baseless allegations against Russia by the way today I was listening to the radio and vesti FM radio I guess that was in bodemer sort of you have an inertia France program that was the morning program around seven o'clock they invited one of the experts on NATO on sanctions and this expert gave a very interesting opinion I will listen to him once again gladly and he mentioned two very interesting points first that undoubtedly all this threat that they talked about in the European Union and we understand that the use backed by NATO all these accusations are Hollow and baseless of course but why are they making them and this is a very interesting view in order to bring together naturally such different countries of the countries of northern southern Eastern Western Europe those are countries which greatly differ in their culture and their dynamics in their way of life and their economic and financial indicators they have different potential and they have different vision of the future for their countries so to create some agenda for them to adhere to to all of them to here to is highly complicated but what can you do about you can bring them together by creating a defense agenda when you come up with a common enemy to fight against and within this paradigm they are quickly brought together they quickly United and this seems natural although there's nothing natural about it and the first point I would like to focus your attention on he was citing the data of public surveys in the EU in the NATO countries and the people were asked why do you think Russia would attack you and nobody could provide any kind of a definite answer some said that they wanted the treasure wanted to gain additional territories but those are probably people who have never seen Russia on a map I believe that this might be the clue as to why are they doing this it's much more complicated to bring someone together and bring them to adhere to a positive agenda you have to do something in order to be creative in order to come up with something but when you have this defense agenda it's very easy to unite people around it to rally them around the flag without actually undertaking any efforts without making any material contributions now moving on to a different topic we've received questions from CNN regarding the situation around the u.s. citizen in Chukotka region we are following this situation with American citizen John Martin he was traveling in his boat along the Yukon River then he went into the open sea and got lost and on the 1st of August he was at the shores of the Chukotka autonomous region he was then taken to the city of an adder over the course of his medical examination in a local hospital and as I've said that we've provided help to the American citizen he was diagnosed with the u RTI as of now his life is not under any threat and his medical condition is stable he keeps receiving the necessary aid and he has no complaints the ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities and the American diplomatic mission now a different topic we've paid attention to the information from Belgium regarding the financial fee that the journalists have to pay to undergo security checks so we are talking about a journalist financial fee they need to pay in order for their credentials to be verified this predictably spurned a wave of criticism on the part of journalists journalists this new regulation entered into force because of the amendments made in February of 2018 to the Belgian law of security from 1998 and those media representatives who hold Belgian citizenship or are constantly working in Belgium now needs to pay a fee of 50 euros to undergo once every six months credentials and security check with the Belgian law enforcement bodies so this is kind of a check that you have to pay for and this would and people would just check whether you are decent a decent journalist or not so why are we worried about that because Russian journalists in Belgium might suffer as a result of this measure and actually they informed us to this new fee and they wanted us to express our opinion we believe that this is discriminatory to do that and this serves to limit the freedom of the media because you are making journalists pay for the opportunity to do their job this is not clear how they are going to implement the law in practice but we would like to underscore that the European Commission condemned this new law and is not going to spread those best practices throughout the EU on the contrary they are going to check what are the local firms to their EU standards but I guess that everyone should know about this especially the journalists so that they would not be accused of any sabotage or of any improper behavior on the 3rd of August and this once again once again is in a kind of an overview of foreign media on the 3rd of August they printed the article of the Press Trust of India entitled Russian are targeting elections in Indian Brazil Oxford expert tells us makers lawmakers why are you laughing at that not making this up the article tells about their recent hearings in the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on foreign States and social media Phillipe Robert Oxford professor which studies Internet Philip Harvard mentioned that after the successful interference into the u.s. elections Russia is going to use Detroit interested technologists to try to influence the results of the upcoming election campaigns in India and Brazil to rig them in Russia's favor I believe those endless Rousseff obeah campaigns of American functionaries are not even worth talking about and that would be just so if we wouldn't be talking about in Indian media why those allegations were made we can understand that that's clear and the purpose of this Senate get-together is also evident and no one even tried to mask it they wanted to drive a wedge between us and our partners including our BRICS partners and I would like to remind you that the recent BRICS summit was a success it was open and very productive and yes the Americans were greatly disappointed with the outcomes of the summit's of the credibility of the g5 and their cooperation on the issues of global agenda and back to the constructive agenda what can you counter it with using smart power soft power nothing they have to stoop down to doing this instead of using their soft power so they are now spreading those fake news again and I would like to draw the attention of the Indian media representatives that those are the very true fake news this is ng BRICS lobbying which is taking place I'm sure that this information would not serve to do anything this just poisons the information media with fake news but the Russian Indian relationships and our cooperation within BRICS would not be affected in any way and last time we had a question regarding the issues when it comes to getting visas by the Russian priests as Sarat agency published this materials we received some lengths in social networks as you're well aware we are always following situations regarding visas provided to our citizens and so we strongly condemn any discrimination on any basis we've seen the materials published by Atari garage and the publication's on social networks we've sent the relevant note to the Greek Embassy in Moscow in order to either confirm or refute these claims and now we are waiting their response we will keep you updated I would like to inform you that as part of the priority project to promote Russian educational system which was adopted by the President on strategic cooperation priority partner projects on the 30th of May the Ministry of Education has launched a database of Russian online programs and courses which were created by professors of famous Russian universities and today on the website and you can find the link in the text version of the briefing anyone can learn more about such scientific topics as economics history information technologies management sociology etc etc and this is distance learning this topics and discourses were prepared by the leading professors of 20 Russian universities and you can also find them in English these materials also contain materials on Russia including and such courses understanding Russia the context of communications between different cultures this is very interesting and we strongly recommend you to visit the site and today on the 9th of August the diplomatic academy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has signed an agreement and we do not often see such agreements being signed the agreement on the cooperation between the diplomatic academy and moats in the Moscow school a 2050 as well as the Council of the veterans the war veterans the Department of Information and publishing as well as the administration of the northern unit of Moscow and together they want to create a Kadett class in Moscow and on the basis of this project this school that I mentioned is going to train the young experts may be future diplomats may be future experts on international relationships they are going to organize any sort of internships to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not only for university students but also for the school children in Moscow this is the kind of a pilot project but taking into account the number of experts working on this project we hope that it will be successful and that's the rector of the diplomatic academy mr. Bhushan have said even if those buboes wendel even though school children would not like to pursue a diplomatic career they would be able to resolve very complex life matters and they would be diplomats in their actual life and maybe resolve some complex issues in other areas now several more announcements during the previous briefing we see the question regarding the Turkish festival in Moscow it's going to take place from 10 to 12 August and across net president Park we welcome this initiative on the part of the Turkish side it's aimed at strengthening the cultural and humanitarian

yes please and good afternoon BBC if question is following Medicare or it's going to measures against the way yeah so thank you William what is good wait I'm sorry this is not going to work like this you're a russian-speaking journalist you know you as such and may I ask the question in English no please ask her to in Russian you speak it perfectly it's your mother tongue please let's not argue and let's keep to the tradition Russian language is in the priority here so I cannot ask the question in English you can ask your question in Russian and I'm I waited with great attention well you know it's like as if we all could not ask her questions in our national language why the Kurdish news cannot ask the question in their national language so let's respect our colleagues fine let's respect our colleagues the question is you have just said that in response to the sanctions proclaimed by the United States the Russian leadership is preparing and going to adopt measures in response so what kind of measures it can be and what happens if the American sanctions concern the flights of err flawed might Russia introduced a ban on the air communication with the United States you know all the measures are being developed developed based on the fact that we are talking about the measures of response it's not just some fantasy we have we don't want to deteriorate the situation in the russian-american relations these are just the retaliation measures so what kind of sanction measures so there will be on the Russian part depends on the American measures they will we will be basing our work on the actions taken by the American side and if we are talking about what this sanctions can be is unprofessional and I think it does not follow the line of our highly professional and dialogue we have here we will be basing our work on what the American lawmakers dream up and what they will come up with if they don't come up with anything we won't do anything if they come up with something we will have to respond if they come up with something extra we will follow the suit you know the rules of the game and in this case they're just as relevant as always and it's not the hundredth time maybe one thousandth time we're talking about this and we've been talking about the destination of this path and even experts have always talked not basing on the pro-russian agenda have been criticizing us since the Soviet era in this case when we talk about nova chalk and the so-called scribble case osprey Amesbury even those experts have four no arguments to justify the american line of action we see that it's a general game and the rows and it has already been distributed between London and Washington and we saw this at the very beginning even just in this case we saw it when Russian diplomats were expelled the main heat was on the Russian diplomats in Washington specifically in Washington and the second demonstration of this is the package of sanctions being developed in Washington we see that different branches of political lobbyists in Washington are working on it and this nova chowk case and this so-called scruple case is being included into this sanction machine so we can talk about this classical conspiration this classical collusion between the US and the UK and everything is happening in within the framework of this coercion this has nothing to do with international law with investigation always what has actually happened there and we actually don't know and if someone does know what happened there please share the information but please make sure it's a trustworthy information not just some propaganda information this is not a matter of Russian agenda to deteriorate the bilateral relations this is the matter of our measures of response in the context of this destructive course which the American side is holding on to and against the backdrop of this game conducted by the Washington and it's hard to hide it anymore they call this solidarity but rather they're just covering each other you know vicious mutual coverage do you have any further questions no thank you next good afternoon Madame Sakura TV Asahi Japanese media please could you comment on this recent process of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia through Japanese Embassy in Russia against the publication of strike Jets su-35s and Japanese authorities have claimed that these actions are against the policy of Japan well Russian actions are in the line of the Russian policy including external policy which is not aggressive which is not aimed at destabilizing relations both bilateral relations with Japan or the region everything that happens on the Russian soil is done in transparent manner and our colleagues are always informed of it we answer the questions and so in this case all explanations have been given at all levels and there is no reason for any further comments what do you think this actions this claims can they influence the negotiations process regarding the coral island do you think this actions this claims how can they influence the negotiations process concerning Creole islands we think that the negotiation process concerning the peace treaty have for some room some broad room for some applied work and this is a negotiations process on the level of vice ministers and corresponding representatives appointed by the parties its economic and humanitarian cooperation in these dimensions numerous dimensions we are working and that's how this work has to be conducted of course parties can express different opinions on different issues but there is a general direction which has been determined by the leadership of our countries and in this context in this line we're following yes please good afternoon within a question of Russia today the former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul has critically criticized the candidacy of Seagal as an envoy on improvement of the russian-american relations and he also claimed that he has no interest on American society so this would be pointless and he also said that this is demeaning to the Russian ambassador in the United States mr. Antonov he also said that in his place he would be integrated by his such trick how can you comment on this I think that this statement by mr. might fall unlike his other statements should be taken very seriously because there is no greater specialist in desperation as mr. mukpo and whatever he said about mr. Seagal has just one question to ask mr. McFaul what about tolerance I don't really understand what what mr. Anton has to do with it mr. McFaul has spent not so much - not enough time in diplomatic realm I don't really understand what mr. Antonio has to do with it why he mentioned our ambassador mr. Antonov is unclear to me we're talking about a social and political position and how he connected these two is not evident to me maybe he can explain it please please turn on the mic if you press the button we will all hear what you say you talk a lot about the need from transparency for example in the screep our investigation would you apply that same principle of transparency here and allow inspectors to inspect the relevant sites inside Russia is stipulated by the new US sanctions legislation and the premiere action with nigari - what are you talking about could you give me an exam please what the u.s. new sanctions legislation says is that they would require UN weapons inspectors to come and inspect sites that may or may not have been used for the preparation of chemical weapons in this country is that something that in the interests of transparency you would allow well what you need to guess and stare into yes it's very interesting how you connect this two aspects are you sure that okay maybe not you personally but I you sure that London will be just inspired by your questions as you are if you are connecting this to topic so strictly I have serious doubts about it that's one thing secondly as far as transparency is concerned sorry do you have any examples that Russia was not transparent when it's fulfilled its obligations on chemical disarmament do you have any data regarding this maybe we have not fulfilled some obligations that we had I have never seen a single report by the OPCW or any other United Nations structure any criticism towards the Russian Federation that's one thing and sports transparency is concerned regarding Salisbury aims grain until yourself interested in what happened there you represent Sky News you represent the British media you have to live in this country you have to live in the United Kingdom and they took that in this country Russian weaponry has been used and here I Russian a subject aren't you interested what actually happened there you do understand it right it's been five months since the incident and still nobody knows what actually happens what is more for four months just like all of us you were told that Salisbury and the entire region is completely secure completely safe all of us were told this and then although the sudden they found some new items related to chemical substances aren't you yourself concerned about it we are concerned about this for a simple reason that in this story first of all the Russian citizen symbol and as a country we obliged we obligated to insist on having access to them to understand what's happening there and moreover we are conducting our own investigation on this topic and we are obligated to insist on interaction with the British law enforcement system in order to establish the connection between these two processes I'm talking about the investigation in Russia and the investigation in the United Kingdom but there's another aspect towards Russia we see a whole range a whole set of political actions which are based on the accusations founded on the incidents in Salisbury Amesbury and we would be very much interested in finding out what actually happened there and that's all if you have any references to some materials that say that Russia has adopted an in transparent approach to chemical disarmament please provide us with them I have never found anything like this they have never been criticism towards Russia in this respect and what is more I think that there should be some kind of sequence we have for criticism towards the UK in terms of that the investigation was completely behind closed doors this is not the story we have made up everything that is concerned connected to classify in this case is taken on by the United Kingdom they officially classified everything which deals with Navi choke portent down sales berry and Amesbury so maybe you should start with transparency and it has been said before by you I'm just wondering given the new legislation given the new sanctions whether you would allow inspectors to sightsee ask I assure us though one was stuck it's the second time I'm asking this question what what sites you're talking what items you're talking about do you have anything specific or are we going to develop on theory just like with the first question for example I don't understand what you're asking what specifically do you need do we have a specific request by the United States or maybe the United Nations we haven't seen one so far what are you talking about are you talking theory hypothesis and so on that's the main issue if you see this new sanctions bill is the an act of collusion between the UK and the US I wondered what exactly you think the role of the UK in these new sanctions is and therefore whether any countermeasures will have repercussions for the UK also if you're talking about collusion collusion in this case right I think I have clearly stated that we see it that there's some double game between the United States in the United Kingdom who are playing this another joke story this political provocation I think it's evident and I have mentioned specific facts to the UK to kaki Mira what measures are you talking about measures taken by Russia we are introducing measures of response towards the country which is introducing sanctions against Russia if the UK introduces sanctions or sanction measures like expelling Russian diplomats or any kinds of measures of unfriendly nature against Russia we always answer will always mirror them if we talk about a different country we unfortunately are forced to respond an adequate mirror symmetrical way yes please good afternoon our vestnik kavkaza how do you evaluate this visit to polar and All American Senator to Russia and say question when concerning sigil Steven Seagal when did you come up with idea to point him how do you evaluate the visit of Paul Randall to Russia I think on the first topic we have already given comments based on the outcomes of his meetings and we hope for further constructive contacts with American sites regarding on different dimensions and their possible and as far as the idea for pointing steven seagal is concerned let me be diplomatic and say that it was implemented very quickly do you have any other issues do you have any other questions as a journalist I would just like to express my opinion the United Kingdom has often the UK has always have often supported the countries which have used weapons against people for example well Iraq used chemical weaponry against Kurds 5000 people died in just mere minutes why did the United Kingdom say nothing and history knows a lot of actions like this on the part of the United Kingdom this is just an opinion it's not a question about Syria situation is rather complicated is actually trying to deal with Syria and so the opinion is that Turkey has to leave Syria otherwise they'll be need to use it the army what is Russia proposing so that this situation between Syrian Turkey would not arrive at the conflict and another question regarding the liberation of the city of idlib but what stage is this operation now what is the status of it as for ad lib I guess you should ask the military experts but I'm going to request information as well but please refer to their Ministry of Defense as for what Russia does in order to stabilize the relationships between Syria and Turkey I would like to remind you that both Turkey and Syria are independent countries they have their own history of relationships and they should build their relationships on a mutually beneficial basis but at the same time while being aware of the difficult political and geopolitical situation in the region Russia is not so much involved in trying to bring together any two particular countries although it's also in their gender but rather trying to resolve the situation their overall situation there are various formats for it Russia can invite the countries to participate directly such as their Astana talks for example or is using a platform to stabilize the situation in Syria for example and this platform also serves to improve their inter state relationships as well I'm talking about for example the Sochi Congress which seeks to establish a dialogue between different ethnic and religious groups we've invited observers and we kept all the parties informed and we used our mediation and capacities in order to express the concerns of some states to other states etcetera etcetera we used to be lateral channels and multilateral channels etc etc cannot go into details of the negotiations and mention what was actually proposed but we are working on that as I've mentioned the ministry in the Minister of Foreign Affairs as regular frolf is going to come to Turkey and this we'll be the focus point of the negotiations moreover this was also the focus of the meeting between the two ministers in Singapore so we are going to make use of all the channels available we are talking about the negotiations between diplomats between the representatives of the military I mean the traditional diplomacy when it comes to negotiations and the operational diplomacy if you will because lots of issues are resolved very rapidly by their representatives in the region via phone calls etc etc for example our ministers talk to each other to resolve their very topical issues and they talk to each other very often so this is what we do and to this is just one aspect of all the work Lord carried out it is even deeper and more multifaceted and in Efrain turkey wanted to change the name of the place and recently they've established their arrogance square in f3 yes please good afternoon International Life magazine on the 5th of August the 8th to the state secretary on Europe and Eurasia West Mitchell called the Sherrod affair of Russia to the embassy and he asked him about the aggressive propaganda of Russia on the social networks how could you comment on that could you give us an example as to how we are trying to spread our propaganda on social media all these criticism that we hear from our American colleagues regarding our interference in the elections our sabotage activities on social media our involvement in the chemical incident in Salisbury we always ask them to provide us with evidence but they do not provide any evidence at all and if previously the Obama administration told us you should follow social networks you should follow all the new posts and you will find your evidence but now they're not even saying that but when this meeting on Norbit choked up place at the State Department regarding the new package of sanctions our representatives wanted them to present facts but no facts were presented zero as for the ongoing investigation they did not answer our questions and as to whether there are any facts already established they told us yes there are facts established but they are all classified so no response was given and speaking of social networks we hear certain agents talking about our interference that we've been trying to dabble with the content with the news at such Rett cetera and in response to our questions just provide us with some evidence and we'll deal with it but they are not providing any evidence so we have not seen any materials that those social networks are naming when they're talking about our interference in our propaganda but it's just not there any questions yes sure second round no problem New York Times I have a question about the military presence of Russia in the Central African Republic in March your colleague mr. Cohen in Hewitt here previous briefing told about 170 civilian instructors currently there could you please specify who they are and how they got there but this is not a question to us but they not the representatives of the Ministry of Defense but they are also not the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and previously in response to this question we said that we are not involved in any private military companies we said that there was no legal basis for the existence of such companies and this is beyond the scope of the ministry but you've received the information from somewhere didn't you yes we received this information because they're physically present in the Central African Republic and we've even talked about the agreements that these agreements were analyzed by the experts of the United Nations regarding the sanction regime currently introduced against the Central African Republic we said that the UN peacekeepers the UN experts are visiting all those training camps all those bases and they see what's going on and they are ok with it so we are not involved in recruiting and sending in selecting those instructors so you asked like who found those instructors and this is not a question you should ask to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yes please trend agency just recently Armenia wanted to have a monitoring mission of the OSCE at the border just like in nagorno-karabakh although nahee chibok is not a part of the conflict area and what is the position of Russia as the co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group is there a need to establish monitoring mission on the border with the - I have not seen any reports so I'm going to specify the information and to get back to you sorry grad TV channel there was this very hyped up story about various internet giants like Apple and Facebook trying to get to Jones who's a journalist very conservative one he is known for his favorable attitude towards Russia and now they're very much criticizing him is this a signal of this American agenda currently being adopted or is this the signal that any opinion to support Russia will be criticized we've been witnessing some inner strife in a political strife in the US under a certain moto and the world has witnessed such in a political strife for many years this was the struggle between various political parties and even this struggle and the fighting and to the disputes inside the parties there were different different allegations being made there were very high profile cases which turned the American political system upside down and now they are trying to use the pretext of Russian aggression at their alleged interference in the election they alleged cyber attacks they alleged use of chemical weapons in the UK the alleged Russia is everything everything that is negative and that is bad this is a certain trend which was set by a political moto if we would use professional PR terminology this moto this slogan because any campaign has a slogan and this is the slogan everything related to Russia everything related to Rousseff obeah is now in high demand because this is nothing new really this was started back in their bomb administration days and this wasn't inherited so to say by the new campaign of the Democratic Party candidate and now considering the impetus and considering the fact that lots of resources were channeled into this topic this remains highly relevant even after their 2016 election so why come up with anything new when you already have this very hyped up anti-russia story you can remember how this was first presented we've talked about this this was around 2012 back then there was nothing on the international agenda no Crimea no Ukraine not even Syria just a part of the Arab Spring issue and back then this story about the anti-russian sentiment started to unfold and the Obama administration supported this and then later it became a part of the Democratic presidential campaign and considering that the Obama administration was fully supporting the Hillary Clinton campaign and Barack Obama was personally lending his support to Hillary Clinton then we might understand where it all came from we remember that the candidate Hillary Clinton was the former state secretary and in the books which were published long before this whole boo-boo a collusion story in this whole antagonistic relationships those books mentioned those topics and those people who read those books those people who follow the situation do not believe there is anything peculiar about this trend anything new about it one more question regarding the foreign and domestic policy just a couple of days ago the President of Russia signed the law on studying native languages and foreign affairs published an article which strongly criticized the signing of this law why do you think that the West treated this purely domestic affair so negatively and can you link it to the fact that in the long term this law would not allow them to separate and thus separate Russia and thus win you know I should really study the law first and then respond to you I'll get back to you on that I need yes spudnick agency I'm sorry I'm in a state of a cultural shock today when you told us about Brussels and that journalists have to pay a fee for their credit that credit ate the accreditation you know I've worked 25 years in the European Union they have not heard anything like that before this is complete nonsense so everything else I talked about today is not shocking to you that's just okay so did I understand you correctly that he you need to pay 50 years to be re accredited to get some document that you are trust who are trust who are trustworthy that you have credentials yes yes that's generally so and does it concern only yes it concerns all the journalists the Western journalists the American journalists etc etc I'm not sure about that maybe the Americans already have their documents when they come to Brussels they like that ex territorial nature of things so maybe they are working in Belgium extraterritorial I don't know but what information we were provided a concerns the documents that the journalists need to receive if they work in Belgium Belgian citizenship or they are foreign journalists working in Belgium well seems seems complicated maybe they don't have any problems for their budgets so why would they do that maybe they have problems with trustworthiness well as you're well aware the NATO HQ is in Brussels maybe that has to do something with it is there anything of the kind in Russia and nobody would like to pay the FSB 50 euro for their credentials to be checked you know you know you don't have to pay to be accredited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs oh I haven't heard anything of the kind me neither thank you we see news I remember who you are Peter as for the Russia's representatives of humanitarian cooperation Steven Seagal the Los Angeles authorities are now carrying out an investigation on sexual assault charges leveled against Steven Seagal has the Ministry know this investigation before he was being appointed what information that the representative of the Russian Federation on humanitarian cooperation mr. Steven Seagal was under investigation for a sexual misdemeanor and Alexei Benedictus the chief editor of the echo of Moscow cited a certain Russian diplomat and said that Steven Seagal when he was appointed received certain security reassurances which come with this position could you comment on that is it true that Steven Seagal has some sort of immunity or something of the kind as for your first question I believe that there is a presumption of innocence and we need to stick to that and with the whole extraterritorial nature of the political situation in the United States I believe that this is the inalienable that we should work from yes for your second question I told you that it is dangerous to read anonymous telegram channels and it's even dangerous to read any sort of telegram channels I'm not sure what the sources and I believe that those were anonymous sources that he cited but this is just not true no diplomatic passport was issued for mr. Segal and whether it can happen yes it can have but an helper can happen if the decision would be made that he should be provided with such a password if it would be beneficial for his work but as of now he is not a holder of any diplomatic passport we've checked that and double check that because they talked about some links from the ministry etc etc but he has no such passport does he have any immunity any sort of diplomatic immunity as for health I hope that he has immunity against diseases but as for diplomatic immunity you should understand the procedure the diplomatic immunity is only provided once a person is being sent abroad and in any country that a diplomat is sent to now it's the case because previously people were mostly working from the Vienna conventions and they understood that a person going abroad has the diplomatic immunity because he just said that he's a diplomat and has a diplomatic passport but now it's not the case for example in the context of the United States States States this was not so the United States not concerned about the color of your passport cover and what's written in it but rather the type of the visa issued for this particular person so you can understand what I'm talking about right so every single time an issue arises regarding the immunity there are countries where people generally understand and generally implement the Vienna Convention provisions but a number of countries have their own views on that and we had precedents before for example when this issue was really topical back in 2005 when we sent several people to the UN with diplomatic passports and they faced some issues and when we had to resolve this issue and then I learned about all these peculiarities in the US towards the diplomatic transports passports passports passports so this situation is very complicated that's why we look at every case separately given the situation and conditions and as far as the United States are concerned it's more a matter of the visa but so will you have a passport issued you said now there is no a picture mr. Sehgal is an American citizen also he has an American passport and this leads to a whole number of conclusions which are just logical it just seems illogical to conduct the whole explanation for you here can you as a Russian citizen ask for a Russian person I'm not a diplomat but he looks like he's and I think I have answered your question and for what all the detail can I give to you maybe you should rephrase your question more specifically as I've said he has he doesn't have a passport the type of visa the issue of immunity is solved individually with every country because every country now has its own understanding of this topic and it means doesn't come immediately but will he be considering the topic of giving him immunity because he is here not in the United States well you know if there will be an issue raised concerning the rationality they need for it then maybe we will be talking about send regime individual way of solving it or automatic Thank You Ossian Kaliningrad
