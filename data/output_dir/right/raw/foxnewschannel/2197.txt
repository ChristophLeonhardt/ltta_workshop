1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:10,950
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,523
GLEN JACOBS, AKA CANE, JUST BODY

3
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,459
SLAMMED A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR

4
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:20,693
MAYOR IN KNOXVILLE.

5
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:23,129
WE CALLED THE DEMOCRATIC

6
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,697
CANDIDATE, LINDA HENNY.

7
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:26,599
HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL THAT WE'LL

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:27,033
GET HER.

9
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:29,469
VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:29,936
>> THANKS.

11
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:31,037
>> Neil: I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT

12
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:33,139
YOU WOULD BE HERE IN THE FLESH.

13
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:35,641
SO I RIPPED UP ALL OF MY TOUGH

14
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,142
QUESTIONS HERE.

15
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:39,879
YOU'RE AN INTIMIDATING GUY.

16
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:41,881
>> I'M TRYING TO PROJECT A

17
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:42,949
SOFTER IMAGE.

18
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:43,783
>> Neil: THAT'S MY STYLE.

19
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:46,119
YOU KNOW, JOINED AT THE HIP.

20
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,286
WHAT MADE YOU DO THIS?

21
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:50,857
>> I JUST WANT TO SEE MY AREA

22
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:52,191
BECOME AN EVEN BETTER PLACE.

23
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:54,894
KNOX COUNTY, TENNESSEE IS A

24
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:55,761
GREAT PLACE TO LIVE.

25
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:58,197
I WANT IT TO BE BETTER.

26
00:00:58,197 --> 00:00:59,799
I THINK THAT -- I CAN HAVE A

27
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,601
SMALL PART IN DOING THAT.

28
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,536
REALLY, IT'S THE MOTTO OF MY

29
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:06,539
CAMPAIGN IS "TOGETHER WE WIN."

30
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,241
I BELIEVE THAT I CAN HOPEFULLY

31
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:10,076
BRING ALL OF US IN OUR

32
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:12,145
COMMUNITY, KNOX COUNTY, TOGETHER

33
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:13,546
TO BUILD AN EVEN BETTER PLACE.

34
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:16,549
>> Neil: YOUR ARMS ARE BIG

35
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:16,883
ENOUGH.

36
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:20,553
YOU'RE FORCEFULLY --

37
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:20,953
>> YEAH.

38
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,488
>> Neil: VERY SUCCESSFUL CAREER.

39
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:23,623
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.

40
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,992
20 PLUS YEAR IN THE WWE.

41
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,026
YOU DON'T NEED THIS.

42
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,494
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS.

43
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:31,130
A LOT OF GRIEF WITH BEING IN

44
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,633
POLITICS, EVEN AT MAYOR LEVEL.

45
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,434
>> IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH.

46
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:37,136
I ACTUALLY HAVE GRANDKIDS.

47
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:38,137
I'M AT THAT AGE.

48
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:39,839
WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT GO ON

49
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,341
IN OUR COUNTRY, I SOMETIMES

50
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:43,042
WONDER WHAT SORT OF WORLD

51
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:44,644
THEY'RE GOING TO INHERIT.

52
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:46,579
AS YOU SAID, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO

53
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,381
DO VERY WELL FOR MYSELF.

54
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,415
YOU'VE DONE WELL.

55
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:51,017
I WONDER IF THEY'RE GOING TO

56
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:51,951
HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES.

57
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:53,686
SO MANY TIMES WE SEE THE THINGS

58
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:56,022
THAT I BELIEVE IN, THE FREE

59
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:57,890
ENTERPRISE SYSTEM.

60
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,960
INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,063
REALLY DEMONIZED.

62
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:08,701
>> Neil: AND YOU SUPPORTED THE

63
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,235
MAYOR IN 2008.

64
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:10,870
>> YES.

65
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,570
>> Neil: WHAT ABOUT TRUMP?

66
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,406
>> I THINK TRUMP HAS DONE A VERY

67
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:16,075
GOOD JOB, ESPECIALLY WITH THE

68
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:16,409
ECONOMY.

69
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,744
HE'S CUT REGULATIONS, THE TAX

70
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:20,613
CUTS HELPED SPUR SOME GROWTH.

71
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,082
I'D LIKE TO SEE SPENDING CUTS,

72
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:23,783
BUT HOPEFULLY --

73
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:25,384
>> Neil: YOU'RE BIG ON LIMITED

74
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:25,785
GOVERNMENT.

75
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:26,552
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT.

76
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:27,720
GOVERNMENT IS OUT OF CONTROL.

77
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,655
GETS OUT OF CONTROL.

78
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:31,057
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE.

79
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:34,360
YOU DO WANT TO IMPROVE THE

80
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,862
INFRASTRUCTURE AS DOESN'T TRUMP.

81
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:38,931
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

82
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:40,499
>> IN OUR CASE, WHAT JUST

83
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:43,002
HAPPENED IN TENNESSEE, THEY

84
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:44,370
THERE'S MORE MONEY COMING IN TO

85
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:44,804
THE STATE.

86
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:46,038
>> Neil: ARE YOU FOR THAT?

87
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:47,339
>> I WAS NOT FOR THAT.

88
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:48,374
BUT IT'S HAPPENED.

89
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:49,942
>> Neil: IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE

90
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:50,709
MORE INFRASTRUCTURE.

91
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,077
>> YES.

92
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:53,612
IN THIS CASE.

93
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:55,281
BUT OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE

94
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,248
GOVERNMENT DOES THINGS LIKE THAT

95
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:58,784
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE APPLIED TO

96
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:01,620
THE PROJECTS THAT THEY SAY IT'S

97
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,322
GOING TO BE APPLIED FOR.

98
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:06,225
IT'S INCUMBENT ON ELECTED

99
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:07,459
OFFICIALS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF

100
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,428
WE'RE GOING TO DEMAND MORE TAX

101
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:11,397
MONEY, WE USE IT IN A PRODUCTIVE

102
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:12,965
MANNER INSTEAD OF SAYING THIS IS

103
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:14,900
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE IT FOR

104
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,636
AND FIND OUT IT WAS USED FOR

105
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:20,906
SOMETHING ELSE AN SOMETIMES

106
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:21,307
FRIVOLOUS.

107
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:24,677
>> YOU WON BY 17 VOTES, THE

108
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,111
REPUBLICAN UNTIL NATION FOR

109
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:26,445
MAYOR.

110
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:28,580
DID THE WRESTLING BACKGROUND --

111
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,482
THE BUZZ IS THAT WE HAD YOU ON.

112
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:32,918
YOU GOT MORE ATTENTION WHEN WE

113
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:34,153
HAD PRESIDENTS.

114
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:35,554
NEVERTHELESS, DID THAT HELP YOU?

115
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,956
>> YES, IN MANY WAYS IT DID.

116
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,659
IT GOT MY FOOT IN THE DOOR AS A

117
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:40,993
NOVELTY.

118
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:42,561
YOU CAN ARGUE, DID IT HURT ME?

119
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,595
I DON'T THINK SO.

120
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,064
I THINK A LOT OF THE FOLKS THAT

121
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:46,699
WOULD JUST JUDGE ME AS A

122
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,400
CHARACTER I PLAY ON TV, THEY'RE

123
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,669
NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME ANYWAY.

124
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,271
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S COOL.

125
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,239
LIKE THE PEOPLE HERE IN THE

126
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:54,573
STUDIO.

127
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:57,009
>> Neil: AND YOU'RE A VERY SMART

128
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,877
GUY, A ENGLISH LITERATURE GUY.

129
00:03:58,877 --> 00:03:59,244
WELL-READ.

130
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:01,013
UP ON THE ISSUES.

131
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,949
>> THAT'S THE POINT.

132
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,784
ESPECIALLY IN A LOCAL ELECTION,

133
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,319
WHAT IS GREAT IS TO GET OUT AND

134
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,086
TALK WITH PEOPLE.

135
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:09,855
WHEN THEY MEET ME, THEY REALIZE,

136
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:12,457
HE'S KANE THE WRESTLER.

137
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:14,092
>> Neil: CAN I GIVE YOU A TIP ON

138
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:14,393
THAT?

139
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:17,696
YOU HAD A HELL OF A HANDSHAKE.

140
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:20,197
HOW MANY HANDS DID YOU BREAK IN

141
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:21,099
YOUR COUNTY --

142
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,036
>> AS I SAID, I'M SOFT IN MY

143
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:24,336
IMAGE.

144
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:25,370
IT WAS ALL GOOD.

145
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,540
>> Neil: I WAS THINKING OF

146
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,574
WRESTLERS.

147
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:32,044
EVERYONE THINKS OF JESSE

148
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:32,377
VENTURA.

149
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:34,312
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SATISFIED

150
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:35,614
JUST BEING MAYOR.

151
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:37,649
>> THAT'S ALL I'M CONCERNED WITH

152
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:38,049
RIGHT NOW.

153
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:39,117
>> Neil: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

154
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:41,886
I DO BELIEVE -- WHAT DID I SAY?

155
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,922
>> YEAH, YOU RIPPED UP YOUR HARD

156
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:44,756
QUESTIONS.

157
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,591
BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT JOB.

158
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,060
REALLY THE MAYOR OF KNOX COUNTY,

159
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,496
HE HAS INFLUENCE ALL THROUGH THE

160
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:54,566
EAST TENNESSEE REGION.

161
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:55,800
>> Neil: IS THAT RIGHT?

162
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,368
>> YES.

163
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:58,403
THE THIRD BIGGEST COUNTY IN THE

164
00:04:58,403 --> 00:04:59,738
STATE OF TENNESSEE AND THE

165
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:00,639
CAPITOL OF EAST TENNESSEE.

166
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,644
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LIVES

167
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,712
OF MILLIONS THAT ARE IMPACTED.

168
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:09,014
>> Neil: IT'S NOT A DONE DEAL.

169
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:11,683
YOU'RE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION

170
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:12,183
IN AUGUST.

171
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:12,817
>> YES, SIR.

172
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,319
>> Neil: OUTSIDE THE BOX

173
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,388
CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN THRIVING.

174
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:20,091
THE PRESIDENT IS AN EXAMPLE OF

175
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:20,825
THAT.

176
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:25,563
AND SO MANY POPULISTS, ARMY

177
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:27,766
VETERANS AND WAR HEROS, ARE

178
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:28,500
FLOODING THE POLITICAL SYSTEM

179
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,900
THIS YEAR.

180
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,935
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON?

181
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:32,704
>> PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF

182
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:33,571
CAREER POLITICIANS.

183
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:35,573
WE'VE SEEN IT AT THE HIGHEST

184
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:35,874
LEVEL.

185
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,143
A LOT OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE

186
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:40,545
POLITICAL REALM BELIEVE THAT

187
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,381
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS AN ANOMALY

188
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:45,316
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE.

189
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:46,685
I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

190
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,353
THROUGH ALL LEVELS OF

191
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:48,753
GOVERNMENT.

192
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:49,854
WHETHER YOU'RE ON THE LEFT OR

193
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:50,822
THE RIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT

194
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:51,756
DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU.

195
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:53,058
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR FOLKS

196
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:54,059
THAT WILL WORK FOR THEM.

197
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:55,226
>> Neil: A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

198
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:57,128
ARE WORRIED ABOUT A BLUE WAVE

199
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,063
THIS YEAR.

200
00:05:58,063 --> 00:05:58,596
ARE YOU?

201
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:01,166
>> I'M NOT, ESPECIALLY IN

202
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:01,533
TENNESSEE.

203
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,301
I THINK AS REPUBLICANS, WE HAVE

204
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:07,372
TO STICK BY WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.

205
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:10,842
THAT IS PHYSICAL CONSERVATISM

206
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:12,110
AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS.

207
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,178
WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN REPUBLICANS

208
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:14,946
GET IN POSITIONS OF POWER, THEY

209
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,180
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

210
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,782
IN MANY CASES THEY BECOME PART

211
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:18,449
OF THE PROBLEM.

212
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,618
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT A BLUE

213
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:21,486
WAVE.

214
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:23,288
I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE TO ACT

215
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:26,391
LIKE REPUBLICANS AND GOVERN LIKE

216
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:27,058
REPUBLICANS.

217
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:28,927
>> Neil: WELL-PUT.

218
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,462
GLENN JACOBS, I WOULDN'T SAY

219
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:33,498
OTHER WAYS, KANE, HE COULD BE

220
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:36,167
THE NEXT MAYOR IN KNOX COUNTY,

221
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:36,768
TENNESSEE.

222
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:37,802
WE'LL WATCH AGAIN.

223
00:06:37,802 --> 00:00:00,000
OUR OVERTURES ARE OUT TO LINDA
