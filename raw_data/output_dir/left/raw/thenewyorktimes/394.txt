00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,240
Double Dutch provides activity for some
children who have nothing else to do.

2
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,040
[It] creates confidence, creates health 
and wellness within them.

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,920
And gives them a place to shelter 
and just be kids again.

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,450
Competitiveness definitely changed the 
style. Before it was just jumping,

5
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,360
now everybody has — they come out with 
their own colors

6
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,410
and their own way of doing things.

7
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,219
I think that diversity will 
bring it back.

8
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,159
Everyone wants to do it, it looks like.

9
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,070
There’s older, younger people, boys, 
girls, everyone …

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:00:00,000
double Dutch is coming back.
