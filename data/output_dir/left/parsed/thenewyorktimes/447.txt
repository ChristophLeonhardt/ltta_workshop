This is my home.
It might be a little small
but I love it.
This is the stuff I put in it.
My memories. 
I've been here all my life and
this is the only town I know.
I love Cairo and I'm not
giving up on Cairo.
But if they just, just tear 
down these buildings
without doing anything
there won't be a Cairo.
They're shellshocked.
It's trauma, it's trauma.
They are experiencing that
stress because their parents
are stressed so they feel that. 
They're uncertain.
They don't know where they're
going to go, they don't know
what they're going to do.
They're looking at possibly
saying goodbye to teachers and
people that they've known their
whole lives not knowing whether
or not they're going to come
back in the fall.
Dear Ben Carson, 
my name is Robert Williams.
I am currently living in the 
housing development.
I've been living there my whole
life.
At times I hate living
in the projects but I'm always
going to love where I came from.
