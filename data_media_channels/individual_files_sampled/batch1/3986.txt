ladies and gentlemen please welcome Mike shields hi everybody they asked me to introduce the marketing pillar so welcome to the marketing pillar this afternoon in marketing industry right now as you know everything is going great and there's nothing to worry about and everything there's no change and we're all good so just enjoy the afternoon but it uh you know there's a you you guys know all this stuff but it's there's there's so much to talk about this it's a time of crazy change and uncertainty in media and really every industry but every every big marketers getting disrupted they don't know how to reach consumers like they used to marketing used to be this side-to-side fluffy discipline seemingly we just make ads and tell everybody about your product and it was easy now marketing executives have to be technology experts they have to talk about things like AI and data science like they're never used to before so we're going to talk about that this afternoon I'm going to talk to the president of Pinterest about visual marketing visual search and what that means for their their businesses we've got Jeff Ramsay talking later about the explosion of video unfortunately Jeff's not a great presenter but we're gonna try and get him up here and it was best we've got a marketing executive for uber again another company with not much going on not much to talk about there and the interest in the news so that'll we'll try and get through that one and just the other I was at an NBC event yesterday I think and the topic him that came up is come up a lot is like do brands even matter anymore which I thought was really uplifting for this industry we're gonna talk to you a company called brand lists that is really trying to like upturn or up it up in the traditional Procter gamble businesses of the world and really really asking that question like do people care about the products do the messages that you guys are putting out there so on that wonderful note I'm sorry we've got a we've got it represent her and I'm your name is I'm totally Kevin Gallagher the research drivers be a bit busy I intelligence or coworker so I should know you that's terrible at it nice to meet you unless let's get into it so I want to start off today by taking a quick poll of the audience who here in the past week has washed its show on cable TV raise your hand okay so more than half maybe not so surprising but it kind of is because well people are watching less TV and we're switching our consumption over to digital and a major driver of that is cord cutting people are seeing less value in pay TV and are starting to stream or video content their digital channels and over-the-top and so what happens when we switch our behaviour well ad dollars are eventually follow so 2017 is a first year that digital ad spends surpass TV ad spend in the US so just to recap people are watching less TV people are cutting the cord and marketers are shifting dollars so it's not really looking good for TV right now right well TV's not dead and why do I say that well because people are still watching a ton of TV on average people are watching three times as much TV as they do digital video and marketers are still spending a ton of money on TV it's a seventy billion dollar industry and even though digital just surpassed TV people are still investing and why is that well because TV ads are still effective they still reach 96 percent of households in the u.s. they're transparent you know where your ads are showing up what shows are showing up on and in that sense it makes it brand safe so you don't have to worry about your ads showing up on some offensive content and these last two buckets transparency and brand safety well they've been some issues in the digital industry for quite some time now you don't really get those issues on TV but TV still has a major problem and that is that ads are imprecise so over two-thirds of marketers agree that targeting is a huge challenge in TV right now and people really want to increased relevancy marketers agree with that so we think about TV there's this old adage where you spray and pray and you hope that you're catching the right audience you cast a wide net and you hope you catch the right people so you think you're buying your audience but really you're buying it too show so let's take a look at spray-and-pray in action so all these household are watching an episode of friends and during the commercial break they all see this ad for baby formula well it turns out the only two the korean households are actually in the market for baby formula the other ones don't need it they don't really care about baby formula they're not gonna need it anytime soon so they get up go to the kitchen get some wine and a snack and come back so that's a problem because not only do marketers not want wasted ad spend but users viewers want more relevant ads we axe our research panel which is the best way to improve commercials on TV and one of the top answers was better relevancy okay so there's room for better relevancy on TV so how do you do that well addressable TV is one way to improve relevancy on TV and basically what you're doing is you're taking behavioral data from digital channels and matching that with set-top box data so in essence you can target different households with different ads but they're still watching the same show so let's go back to the friends example the young couple sees an ad for baby formula but let's say an avid cyclist 'is a ad for a mountain bike that's coming out so that sounds great you're gonna only target the people that you want to target and nobody else but does it work well let's take a look at a case study Toyota went to Direct TV and they said I want to target only people are looking to buy a car in these five markets five states and so through data matching DirecTV was able to identify only those households and only served commercials to those TVs and what Toyota saw was a 19% increase in visits to dealerships okay so worked for Toyota and other people are also seeing value and some of the top reasons are seeing value with addressable campaigns is because they reach your desired target they increase user engagement and they deliver ads to new and hard to reach audiences and all of this is good people are seen success with addressable some brands some advertisers but is it gonna save TV well probably not the fact of the matter is people are still cutting the cord people are still shifting their user behavior to digital channels and addressable isn't going to reverse cord cutting it's not going to change user behavior but it will have a big impact on traditional TV and for three big reasons and the first one is TV is no longer just mass-market so you think of a mass-market product like toilet paper and toothpaste you know everybody uses it hopefully so you can just kind of you know spray and pray and it's okay because it doesn't have to be targeted so with addressable TV you're able to use more precise data based on interest to refine targeting messages and that really opens a door for niche advertisers who maybe didn't have the budget before but they still want to take advantage of the four hours per day that people are spending on TV and second is better analytics so with addressable technology you're using data that can be tied back to digital behavior so this really allows for a better measure of ROI versus linear TV so this leads to better measurement better analytics and ultimately better optimization of your total spend and that's important because addressable is reaching up 50% picture penetration in in 2018 so there's going to be really more opportunities to target more efficiently across more households and then last it'll smooth the transition to digital so what we're seeing right now is linear TV digital OTT they're all converging pay TV providers are still trying to figure out their digital strategies so in the mean time addressable TV really allows marketers to use their TV dollars more efficiently so as we converge our time fragment our time across multiple device is multiple platforms addressable really is AIDS and this convergence so you're bringing linear TV targeting closer to digital targeting and thank you please welcome Tim Kendall with Kristin lemco and Mike shields hello guys thanks for being here I've had this it's it's full beard seasons coming on yeah after Thanksgiving it really hurts to go you've got part of one I put a tie on I you know I always wondered with these conversations whether how much of this should be like what is the state of Pinterest who are you guys so I thought why don't you ask them how many people in the audience use Pinterest raise your hands all right so you this is not like a totally uninformed crowd that's good because it struck me in the last session Ben Larry was talking about how snapchat kind of gets a bum rap because a lot of the people to cover it don't use it and get it because it's really young and I wonder I was gonna ask you if that happens if you guys face that in the but among among ad buyers and and so I have you figured out like how you explain your place in the world where you fit in the meet the marketing media landscape yep since you soon like who are you who did you say you were when you got there how are you trying to explain Pinterest to the world and how is that evolved and wherever you found your Nisha I think we've always said that it's it's a visual discovery service um so we in that vein we want to do for discovery what Google did for search and so people use the service to plan their lives right that and that spans from the what am I gonna cook for dinner tonight what am I gonna wear tomorrow how do I want to style my hair this weekend two more life events like what Oh want my wedding to look like what I want my apartment to look like what kind of home do I want to live in in a year where I want to travel for the holidays so it's it's people use the tool to plan I think where people misunderstand us and this happens on the consumer side it's not just market yeah is they think we are just another social network they think that it's a broadcast medium like Instagram right or Facebook or others and that people are there to broadcast and to learn about what their friends are doing and neither of those rights Jim Jim because it's nap was talking about this earlier that like I think two-thirds of their audience creates like everyday are all the time do most Pinterest users not our most pictures users searchers or creators so they are they are most are creators but not in the way that you think they're creators in that they are creating their own collections yeah things that they want to do right they create I mean people build you know we will have 300 thousand women this month create boards about the baby they just found out they're gonna happen right so that's not something that people do every day but when when you're in that mode you are all about those moments and career curating what you're interested in so in okay so that's that X that helps us define the the rori where you fit in the world in terms of people's consumption habits what have you how long did it take you to figure out where you stand in the marketing you know are you if you're Google you're like you get you get thrown into the search bucket or you are beat you probably got pushed into the social budget by some agencies and marketers what was that process like alright where are you now well I think I think people are still trying to understand sort of precisely where we fit because we are we're about planning but it's early planning so it's it's before I really know what I want before I'm not right about to buy something it's not that I mean I go to Google and I go to Amazon when I'm ready to go what I say spearfishing yeah I know I want 32 inch waist AG CAC pants but what if I want to figure out what a different fashion style is for me what if I want to figure out what I want my apartment to look like that's not a query that makes sense actually in text nor does it really make sense to do on Google or Amazon right but it's a perfect use case for Pinterest because we can help you figure out what your taste is and then help personalize recommendations around that and get you honed in on what exactly do I want my apartment in fact the bedroom in my apartment to look like and we can sort of hone in on new things I would say we hone in on what is Mike planning for well he's planning to redecorate his bedroom in fact he's planning to select a bedside table yes we know that and then we also know your tastes so we know that you like mid-century modern so it's it's really personal and personalized in that sense and it's been the combination of being able to explain to marketers we can give you the mode of planning that the consumers in yeah and we can tell you their taste with precision so you can reach that consumer and incredibly relevant way at a moment when they're in market so that probably means you're getting ad budgets from the the bottom of the funnel type marketer to the top and top and you got something you got to talk to everybody yeah and tell that story and communicate what you're good at when ya that's complicated that takes a while Kristin what are you doing here you're a bank people don't think I think I think it's a new string pairing cuz I think I think people wouldn't extinct you know retail home decor perfect for Pinterest banks what are you guys doing there so I think of it as a search company but a little bit further down the funnel so we're a payments company I think we're one of the biggest payments companies in the world and I think what's interesting to me about Pinterest is when people are on it they have expressed some kind of intent to buy a thing when you're on Google you may be looking to buy a thing but you may just be interested in whatever Wikipedia so that's interesting to us and to big verticals that they're in that work well for our products our home design we sell mortgages and we sell reef and and travel so we've got a couple of travel cards and the insights that you get from Pinterest and the data that you get from Pinterest I mean one of the best campaigns we did was using Pinterest data to inform the creative on where people were traveling to so what does that look like are you you know somebody is thinking about going on a big trip and you just dangling an offer then like a like a very oh I centric Kody are kind of are you doing something very controlled we've done so in sapphire Reserve which is a travel and dining card we've done top of the funnel brand awareness on people who have the card and we want them to continue to use it that's just as important to us as acquisition and in-home lending we use first-party data to target people who'd been to our site who were searching because remember all the terms are unbranded that they're usually searching for in Pinterest they're not looking for chase mortgage home design home decor bathroom decor and we would retarget them with the direct response ad when we saw you know double what we would expect in consideration we saw double what we'd expect in brand awareness and we sell lower CPI interesting it's a little bit of a left turn but how much are you could I think of you as there you were you were famously quoted recently in this New York Times story about how you guys you brand safe to think was blowing up and you you were you guys are reducing the number of sites are running on so I wonder how much of like are you running how much are you out there all of a sudden screaming Pinterest is Brad save we don't have those problems and how much is it is that an appeal for you right now it's an appeal it's a big appeal and I think the platform's have more of a responsibility to give brands better optionality than we have today other than do-it-yourself which is kind of what we've had to do so it's an appeal I don't know that you guys are screaming at your totally brand safe because I don't know that anyone can but it you with less user generated its nature you'd be more safe yeah I mean I have no idea because I'm I just noticed this I'm a research analyst congratulations yeah I'm on the wrong path that's interesting what am i I'm good I think I'm still me I think you're at your yeah okay right yes we I think the brand safety issue has it has been self-evident to marketers that we are brand safe so it hasn't been something we've had to you know shout from the hills about right have you got pretty for anyone who's a user it's pretty obvious there's not a fake pin problem going on now from the Russians like they were through story about that's good so we're we're have you found yourselves in the I I think people want to find the next challenger to the duopoly and I think I think it's often Abbas on maybe it's both I don't I don't know if people are saying that about you guys yet but is that is that a realistic thing that you wanted trying now that you've kind of really feel that for a business and you've gotten traction in this marketplace can you get can you get in that game can you challenge those guys I absolutely I mean I think that you know just putting it sort of down to basics what Google has built and what Facebook has built are basically phenomenal engines for when people already know what they want people might argue that's not true on Facebook but big chunk of their business is retargeting yeah based on what you have already done based on intent you've already declared and so when you think about the domain of marketing where I don't quite know what I want a lot of those dollars are still offline yeah let's go said this that's TV those are TV toxic retrieval dollars and I think that we will have a greater right to those dollars given what we do then the other folks given what they do I mean I've been a big loud mouth that Amazon will absolutely be the third in the Tri Apple II is that even a word yes but Pinterest looks much more to me like Amazon and it does like Facebook and Google if you can get the activation Tim and I've been talking about this for a long time of click to buy when somebody's already in the consideration set to buy as a credit card company that's really interesting how do you make sure that that centric sir this is how we've talked about this but I keep bringing up snap a lot because everyone there they're here today and won't start my them yeah they've gotten hit by Facebook and Instagram specifically going after their functions and copying what they do Amazon its kind of getting into some of the stuff you do Instagram could also how do you make sure that you don't get whacked by one of those guys and have your core functionality co-opted or I mean I've this is a bit of a technology cliche but just got to keep innovating right you just got to keep giving people a great product that is more personalized and helps them discover stuff that they're excited about in love right I mean there's an there's there's sort of two pieces to what we spend our time doing we're building things that help the discovery process so recommendation feed and search and then we're also building to Chris's point a bunch of things that make it easy that once you discover something you love that recipe that hairstyle we want to make it incredibly easy to go do it and so I think that through a focus on both of those I mean we just have to out-innovate on both dimensions speaking of innovation let's talk I don't know if everybody most of the folks here know Pinterest I don't know how many people know what you're doing with lens and the whole yeah me I'm one of the leading journalists and pretending I understand what machine learning really is but how are you I do the same thing how how are you how what are you guys doing there with visual search we have real-world search take us throughout that yeah where you think what you thinking about there and where it's go discovery super visual so we've been invested in sort of the domain of machine learning around visual technology called computer vision for four or five years and that has led to a lot of ways that we do our recommendations today are through computer vision we basically look at pins we look at the visual attributes of pins you like and then make recommendations on that basis we've basically taken that technology and now allow our users to use their camera if they see you know a chair that they love they can lens the chair and then we show them different environments in which that chair might look good we do the same thing for outfits how hard is that because you could you see it's it's very not that searches I think it's pretty car yeah like I mean we we have been working on it for years we've acquired a number of companies who are you know sort of the foremost experts and we still don't always get it yeah I mean you look at what YouTube's going through right now where they can't they they can't necessarily see everything every year they don't know what every video is and I mean that video it's different than images but imagine images are a lot harder than text yeah so we what we've done with that is it's a it's a product on Pinterest that you can use we've also license it to target so it's now in cartwheel or will be in cartwheel as their visual search and then it's embedded in every galaxy si so you go to the native camera app and you can either take a picture or you can lens something you go into their mobile browser you're browsing a website you see an image you want to know more about you long press and it generates a Pinterest visual search that that's that's a pretty new behavior you're asking people to take on right how it's gonna take time yeah I'm like so what have you seen so far how do you get people to start thinking that way well it's a you know you just got a prompt you got a prompt people and you gotta explain the value I mean I tell the team that I don't think Bluetooth has been around for 15 years mm-hmm I think they finally saw Bluetooth with the air pods I think Bluetooth actually now works even though it's been around for 15 years and I think a lot of these visual things they're not gonna take 15 years right but they take the innovation on the technology side and then you know acclimating on the consumer side I think it's gonna be easy people are using the camera already I don't think it's gonna take a long lead time lots of other services that are using yeah chase is using the camera right credit card capture course how much would christen are you guys thinking about like everyone's saying this that we need to figure out what we're doing in AI and machine learning and like how much of that is a big part of what you're advertising businesses well it looks like right now versus a couple years it's a big part of our core business yes on our advertising business I think you know honestly we got to walk first and that I'm much more interested in the interruptive ad is a format being broken like this concept that it's okay to interrupt someone's experience is based on this premise that you're sitting at home watching TV and you're doing something that's passive where you originally had to get up and go across the room to change a channel or find a remote when you're on digital you're by nature not passive and it's a whole lot easier to just swipe out of something so I think like even in the case of YouTube yes they've got to get brand safety right but I think pre-roll is a bigger problem it just pisses people off so I'm worried that's it's actually why Pinterest in other platforms are great that we're fighting the wrong battle on the targeting and this and that when the ad unit itself is fundamentally broken and the consumers already told us they don't want to be interrupted yeah attention the the economics of the ad industry built on interruption and really are media companies based on interruptive advertising are all under stress yeah everyone about it I mean with one exciting interruption Facebook and Google which are great yeah our permission-based ads by Nature right I mean the exception is Google is is paid search yes not that's definitionally and for the most part has is not interruptive it's the exception I think that Pinterest will prove to be the exception as well right I've known the arrow during the time we should probably uh their audience questions I know we're supposed to give some time for audience questions I'm jumping around topic for her to see up here not yet okay I want to ask you first about about what you guys are doing this is told another shifting gears with with programmatic the this seems like it's been a year of reckoning with the ad tech murky ecosystem where are my ads running who's taking money who's taking nips at our that every dollar we spend do you where are you guys netting out now that you've you've kind of taken a hard look at that everywhere all your advertising money's going do you have any regrets like what why was it you know yeah why was i running at so many sites what was it totally like the fact that actually everybody applauded that was kind of weird to me when the real question should have been like what the hell was wrong with you on all of this stuff when we were doing it in-house so you know I think obviously fraud is just never-ending whack-a-mole you know as a credit card company we should be able to figure this out better viewability is a huge problem again the reason people are using interruptive ads is because you can measure it whereas you don't know on some of the other formats and then we've got to continue to call the whitelist and not go on platforms where we think it's brand unsafe but it's never-ending I mean did the industry in general no because it wasn't just you guys get too caught up in the idea that audience-based buying was the end-all be-all and we don't need to really need to think about environments so much anymore that's like a dated thing I think we all drank the drug of user-generated content as being the thing without really thinking through ultimately what those risks were going to be which were all highly predictable if Google has the best algorithms in the world and their filters can't catch all of this we had to have known that there was going to be a problem right Tim another shifting gears what what where how is as your company develops is becomes more habitual for people that use Pinterest for their lives to plan how does voice enter the picture for you is it good or is it good for you guys bad if everyone starts doing this kind of stuff could you see that folks you know the Alexa's and other tools like that in getting and getting in your way helping you totally different thing the behavior we see for the most part in terms of discovering things is that people want to use images as the input yeah not their voice I mean the voice input for what show me a great mid-century modern bedroom that is going to give you a range that spans it's not going to give you any precision whereas if you can pick out a photograph you know there's hundreds of thousands of bits of information in there about the attributes of that image that we can then use as a jumping-off point to give you something very personalized so you know you're not saying you're not you'd that you know by voice is gonna be big just not those use case I think voice has proven that it works pretty well for spearfishing yeah I want a sports score or some other objective information but you know and clearly they'll be able to personalize it to some degree but you know we want to be able to we think that with visual discovery for now there needs to be a visual input and then we'll give you visual results I mean I think there will be some use cases around visual or audio input for show me a great recipe with I don't know chicken there'll be some use cases for that but I think people are gonna side more with what I unless screens become a big part of that in-home experience which may or may not happen a little bit sure but what about the input yeah it's still it's still still it's no the same kind of task behavior that you you're gonna hear you're you're talking about plan we're paying attention to yet I just don't it's not it's not top of mind for us right or Pinterest so anybody sir it's not there's there's basically no UGC on Pinterest users take that content from professionals professional merchants in public but it's not a photograph that they took told the API right yeah we're rarely it's it's you know the vast vast majority is content from merchants retailers bloggers right my point on user-generated with YouTube it's something like four hundred thousand hours of stuff that's almost in part that is getting uploaded every hour or some insane amount it's impossible to really check and on we do programmatic through whitelisting we check as often as we can on our own everything we're on and we do direct to publisher correct unless it's a broad-based media partnership with somebody and you guys have ramped up your programmatic options for buyers right even you know a lot of that I believe is direct but tell me about how that's evolutions looked like well I probably wouldn't use the term programmatic and I wouldn't use it a year ago in the same way I wouldn't use it today define what we do I mean we do have options that allow marketers to take their customer data and target their customers on Pinterest that's the closest thing we do to what is sort of definitionally programmatic so did somebody have to cook but did somebody have talked about like workflow does somebody have to call up so many a Pinterest context no but I just think about they're not omniscient as efficient direct by.ya as the proposed to programmatic which I think implies you know machines and RTB and I don't know where my ads are going right all right Xing lots of different data and hopefully it works you're not like I'm insisting on faxes that's the only way I want to work right right right what about there there was a time I think I'm gonna get back to more audience questions there was a time I think we're again I keep comparing to snap because it sits there on top of mine but they're getting a lot of heat for not going fast enough because they went public like real pretty earlier in their evolution you guys have not but there was a time when you were getting heat from some advertisers like wow I want to I want to go faster there at products or they're not ready to take all my money yet what's going on are you still facing those questions or you passed that that's Kristin but I think we're over are you take more of my money and you say no we're past I'll be embarrassed yeah yeah I mean I think that we now have a parody offering for the things the basic things that all marketers want to do and now we're really in that phase of building differentiated things that leverage the visual discovery technology leverage just the nature of the platform itself as a client I sit on their adviser influence or counsel whatever it is I've actually been impressed at how incredibly disciplined they've been on their product development so I think there's benefit in saying you know these are the four verticals we're gonna get exactly right and we want to own this and then growing instead of kind of not knowing who you are and what you wanted for doing everything that it's real discipline to do that and it's been impressive more audience questions sorry so you're sitting right with my content team actually who can help you I so here's an example of when you do and new media companies are much better at this than some of the traditional media companies to think about advertising and editorial is this church and state concept which for journalism of course it has to be but one partnership we did was with Ozzie where we did a joint branded newsletter around ideas for the JPMorgan Chase brand where the reader understands that we would have a point of view on that content and will accept that our brand is on actually least of media with a media partner we did a partnership with Ben lair and now this money where they we are the co-sponsor of the now this money ad people understand that Chase has a right to be and a piece of content that's about helping make the most of their money so instead of spending a ton of money to sponsor someone's new finance channel where I get to rent their audience the audience understands and actually wants advice from their bank on this type of content that they'd rather have first party content or jointly branded content yes yes it's basically becoming our own media company and sometimes partnering with people to do that and sometimes partnering on a media by instead of renting somebody else's audience and interrupting them when they're trying to do the thing they want to do and with the Internet's democratized content creators right there's four hundred thousand hours of stuff going up on YouTube I have 38 million people on chase com every single day and 28 million people on the app checking your balance every day I can put content on there there's been a ton of talk lately about whether there was this NBC event the other day and they had all the all the big big companies from traditional and digital trying to figure out do we need to have some kind of universal way of measuring digital media and I I came away feeling like that's not gonna happen because every brand cares about something different and every medium is has its own unique attributes how much are you hearing about that talk about whether do we need some kind of either we all agree on what ROI is or what you what viewability is or what our time is the way we buy CRP and it's comparable to television is that like never gonna happen some of you yes we need it I don't know if it'll ever happen why did why do you need it so badly because you need to measure you know you you don't you're comparing apples and oranges on these different platforms and you know it's hard to explain and even the media planners and buyers are trying to keep up so you know you need some measurement integrity across platforms that's governed and measured through things that we can all agree on instead of everybody providing their own numbers whether or not we can break down how that happens I don't know I hope so I think we're I'm optimistic but I think we're headed there I think you know just in the past couple years in viewability and audience verification have become standards right that are that are accepted by us as publishers and and you as a marketer and I think the next step is basically like are the ads effective or not what's the way in which we in a standardized way about you and how do you measure effectiveness because the truth is a pre-roll or a pop I like your numbers are gonna tell you it was effective because people saw it it's not going to measure that people hate you leaving that thing in front of them right so how do you get to sentiment how do you get to actually does it make somebody want to buy your product or hate your guts you know right and that's gonna be different for every brand that's right that's the challenge right it's hard to be a marketer you have to figure out how to be a data scientist and a media planner and a media buyer and a fraud expert and most people didn't come up this way no I wonder if there are more audience questions before we keep going I don't think so I would just add on on this point about negative sentiment and signal you know when I was at Facebook for you know the first five years of the ad product the number one thing that we did that led to the biggest jump in revenue was when we introduced negative signal into the relevancy engine meaning what meaning we are gonna we are gonna rank ads based on what Mike tells us he doesn't like so there was an axe at the bottom of the ad and you would exit and then you tell us why you didn't lie and people responded people responded and when we we put that into the relevancy engine we've got the biggest jump and relevancy what I saw on my five years there so it's a powerful to Christians point I mean if if we could get Standardization of visibility around that we could make all ads way better is their is their equivalent initiative you're doing right now Pinterest that you can factor in what people with it yes we do we collect negative sentiment generally on Pinterest because you're looking for something you like there's something more positive about that platform right right you're fundamentally therefore looking at stuff you're not I don't know what I hate are some Pinterest no it's no it's a positive place right no BOTS that we know about that what am I gonna ask you next I'm just I'm thinking about oh the what are there I know you guys are pushed into video people wonder if that's gonna be the next you know there's there's all this talk about how much video money there is in the advertising market it's video a big use case on Pinterest is that something that you're gonna ramp up more it is we're gonna continue to ramp it we now have autoplay video ads we've had them since the summer and they're there they're doing great and they look good they look good from a user experience standpoint I don't think users find them I interruptive at all in fact they're plays different than pre-roll yeah yeah but is that gonna will that ever become your core out of unit or not errors that always gonna be sort of an add-on for you I would suspect over time yes because I think video is probably going to I don't I can't predict exactly how I think video is gonna become more fundamental to all of these services yeah but and that doesn't always require you to do something super custom you're an abstract right what about I'm thinking it a cask in a few years down the road with machine learning lenses the where the business is going like what are some innovations in average end in visual advertising that we might not expect that are that are there are going to be something to either either you lead or the order or the industry is kind of well we we announced this in the spring which is that we are now and I alluded to it earlier we're now using visual signals so computer vision so when Kristen clicks on something like a close-up right she'll take a pin that she sees of a living room vignette so close-up on it we actually go into that pin with computer vision understand shape style color all those attributes and then use that and go into our ad database and scan that on the basis of those attributes that is so much more powerful than there being a key word living room associated with with Kristen clicking on that close up and that's just going and in querying the database for the search term living room so that's gonna be too broad you know what you thought that was for saying broad and it leads to irrelevant right not very well ranked ads when we have that precision of the visual signal we do so much better from a relevancy and the dream is take a picture of something click and it shows up at your door the next day right and if you yes if you if you can even grain that kind of shopping behavior in your platform you want to you want to become a daily vital source for people and that's again you got a lot of people a lot of other companies trying to do that but that's that's it that's we Ben will often say our CEO will say you know we think the camera is the new keyboard yeah and what Kristen mentioned is like that is the use case and I think that's where we're headed cool anybody else we have one one question and that's it so biggest categories homestyle food apparel travel you know biggest advertisers are retailers consumer packaged goods and financial services I think that you're gonna see more folks in autos we're starting to make real traction with those folks and sort of oddly entertainment all right that is it thank you for assuming Jim that's great for a great discussion you please welcome Jeff Ramsay hey everybody so that's I'm gonna talk about TV today let me ask you a question how many people think TV is falls under the heading of media raise your hand how many think it falls under the heading of marketing okay I guess we're gonna have to move to the other room because that's the media room that was a joke okay I know it we just had lunch but we need to get wrapped up here guys there's more coffee back there what I'm here to talk about is the video tsunami and I'm not even referring to the video revolution that you're all thinking about I'm talking about the tsunami of data I'm about to go through in the next 10 minutes with about 358 slides and you think I'm joking so the agenda today is basically to cover where's the consumer going where are the dollars flowing and what is the future state of TV or video as we think of it today and it really all starts with time reminding myself that I only have ten minutes but no it's about the time that people spend with media in the course of a general day e marketers forecasts forecasters have been busy rique running the numbers we look at about 70 different sources and we look at the different definitions methodologies and biases to try to suss out what exactly is happening with media time spent Mobile is number two after television but the story here as we focus on video is right here which is that television Khmer about 75% linear television I should say commands about 75% of 3/4 of the time that we spend watching video on a given day that leaves only about 25% or as we're calculating it a hour and 17 minutes a day that's outside of linear TV and that's across the board so it's a relatively small amount at this point of the game but if you look at it from another angle there's another source that we looked at looking at how fast streaming is is is moving along you're looking at the primary way in which US TV viewers watch their favorite TV shows and the black is the digital source right and you see from 2014 and went from 31 percent to over half or 52 percent so streaming has just really taken over the world and we're gonna talk more about that later also there was another piece of interesting research we look at every piece of research we can up there this comes from Netflix out of those Americans who are watching video outside of the home 44 percent are watching on a plane that's me I'm always on a plane in fact I never see this on a plane three seats just empty like that that just never happens the next one was kind of interesting 37% watch at work I'm sure bosses are excited to see that their employees are watching Netflix at work and then this one I spared you the photo I'm not quite sure what that was all about watching a public restroom then there's the issue of multitasking and when we think about we're trying to reach or engage with consumers it's really hard to do in the video environment when there's so much other stuff going on emarketer zone forecasters have figured out that 81% of Internet users regularly are watching a second screen connected to the Internet while they're watching television and it gets more interesting after that because well we think as marketers that folks are looking at that screen that's you know six feet away from them what often is happening they're splitting their time back and forth back and forth in nanoseconds and they're spending more and more time with that screen that's only three or four or five six inches away from them that's probably the smartphone or maybe their iPad what's also interesting in our reefs or tahn us time spent with media looking at simultaneous media usage we found that 74% of the time what's happening on the TV has nothing to do with what I'm looking at on my little screen in front that's both a threat and an opportunity so while you think as a marketer that I'm watching the TV program and the associated commercials I'm actually doing something completely different don't ask me to explain that but that's the kind of stuff that happens on snapchat and all those other things right so there's a lot of social media and messaging going on while people are watching TV and that's got TV people pretty concerned now let's look at the ad blocking situation we I think he marketers numbers are that 27 percent of all Internet users in the u.s. are regularly blocking ads it's 41 percent among Millennials but it happens in the living room - we never talk about ad walking in the living room this is my living room oh my gosh that's kind of embarrassing hang on a second I'm gonna channel though does anyone remember I drew of Jeannie don't you wish she could do this it's all cleaned up there we go yes boy you guys her just wake up a little it's okay it's okay to laugh it's there's nothing wrong with it so here's my living room and I'm not showing my living room just you know to show you my living room it's to say that when I walk in and my family is watching television I have no idea where that content is coming from the reason for that is we have all kinds of hardware from a Roku to an Apple TV device we've got an Xbox we've got so many devices that are lost in the cushion I couldn't even tell you and we're subscribing to so many different services like Netflix or Amazon Prime or just recently HBO now so that we're not guess what exposed to commercials in fact I can't remember the last time I saw a commercial unless I was in an agency and they forced me to watch one so the point is that is what is happening across America and we'll look at those figures in fact according to the IAB almost 60% of digital video viewers say they are more likely to stream video to their TV in order to reduce or completely eradicate those damned commercials so you know put that in your pipe and smoke it I love this one - this is according to Nielsen what's the number one thing the digital video of ears do or do when they're presented with a pre-roll ad what's the number one thing they do of course we know the answer is they skip the ad it gets even worse if you look at Millennials according to this source 59% say they watched the YouTube ads up right up into the point that they can skip them who doesn't do that right what are the prevailing concerns among the TV industry's anybody in the TV industry here at that I heard some people I get this is the TV area here so the prevailing concerns and I was just at a conference recently is this is kind of the weather report it's somewhat gloomy although there's some interesting optimists out there I was just at this conference by lizard lizard frere and it was all the media heavyweights where they had Les Moonves and various other folks and they were quietly ignoring some of these statistics like from Nielsen which says that over the past five years TV show ratings have declined by 25% that's just over the last five years and viewing per person has dropped 15 percent and if you look at Millennials and particularly young men those numbers even way worse and if you're trying to reach them but you know there's a little confusion out there at les Moonves says I don't even know who I'm competing with well let me help you out les this is what it looks like just just just to be clear I'm just kind of messing with them a little these are our numbers for connected TV users how many people are connected TV users some of you probably don't even know you're just streaming stuff and you don't know what it is but what we've done is we found out that half the population or 168 million people are connected TV users the 48% of them are smart TV users we've seen that number grow really really dramatically people are buying TVs that are basically built to stream right after that is the connected game console at 37% and then after that it basically becomes a horse race between Roku Google chromecast and Amazon fire TV and as you can see my favorite this is the my favorite little device is way down number 6 that's the Apple TV at 13% just not getting traction quite yet then we have the issue which I think was alluded to before by Kevin which is the pay TV universe is shrinking it is not shrinking as precipitously as TV our serie newspapers and mitten print did which just took a nosedive what we're seeing is basically a pretty steady stream down from 2016 200 million pay TV viewers to 185 million right and then concurrently we of course we have the number of non paid TV viewers which is 49 million in 2016 and we see that growing to 75 million by 2020 these are people who are essentially not subscribing to cable TV they're not paying for cable TV they're not getting that bill every month right what they're doing instead of course their cord cutting or their cord Nevers and this is a huge story about Millennials the next generation just in case you happen to want to reach them so cord Nevers and cord cutters skew very young and here's just I could tell you what dozen different research sources this is just one that shows the dramatic difference this is looking at percent of Internet users who use digital video services or devices and as you can see among my age cohort I'll give my age away age 55 of 64 48 percent due among Millennials it's 75 percent and other research data supports this so we can pretty much believe that it's true and what that means is they watch in many or if any ads now there are a lot of people who are talking about the sky falling I think Kevin was referencing is TV dead it certainly isn't but there is one fact that we do have to think about when we think about the sky falling and it's probably best epitomized by Todd younger from Sanford Bernstein follows this TV market really really closely and he said this really compelling statement we can't conceive of any solution that would rekindle interest of kids in teens to watch linear TV that's a pretty strong statement I mean I think he's emitting one one possible solution but that involves a little bit of magic from my friend Samantha and I don't see that happening anytime soon so that brings us to the final part of this which is now that we see what the consumer trends are what are the marketing trends in terms of or the media trends in terms of marketers spending and so we're going to go quick to the dollars the big picture view is the television is still huge it's 72 billion dollars it's eking out a growth rate of about 0.5% newspapers magazines still sucking wind dropping not precipitously anymore but still dropping digital surpass TV we heard that before but these are the official emarketer numbers 83 billion dollars in 2017 is what we're predicting that is driven heavily heavily heavily by mobile which is 58 billion dollars in fact mobile is now 70% of all digital ad dollars spending 70% and and it's similar in other parts of the world Mobile in turn is driven by social media which is not mutually exclusive with video and rich media combined which together about twenty four billion dollars let's dissect that a little bit if we just look at pure video ads spending in the u.s. digital video ads spending as you can see according to the numbers it's only about fifteen billion dollars right compared to television at 72 billion dollars that's quite a wide difference right but if you add in rich media right then you get to a number that's closer to 30 billion dollars so now we're talking almost half of television spending what I mean by that when I add in rich media's that I'm talking about out stream video ads and in feed video ads which are video ads that are not in a video context so think of streaming or in your news feed with Facebook and you're going through text after text after text and then you see a video that's what we're talking about there that's the third you add in those dollars and you've got thirty billion dollars going through a video in a digital sense if we look at the growth rate for digital video itself 16 percent according to eMarketer but you don't have to believe us we can show you almost a dozen others research sources and they're all showing double-digit growth rate so you can pretty much believe that it's true programmatic everybody's talking about programmatic us some 78% of all display ad dollars digitally are bought programmatically the numbers a little smaller with a video it's at 69% but it's growing at 42% by the way anybody trying to keep up with this and write all this stuff down or take pictures don't even bother I will be very happy to send you this presentation after this is over and I will give you the information to do that later so don't don't don't bother if you look at television it programmatically it's only 1.6 percent so we have a long way to go to get television being bought on a programmatic basis and and it's really confusing and and and so on when you look at connected TVs and so on and so there's a whole bunch of work that needs to be done there but what one of our analysts Lauren Fisher said last year was is that 2017 will prove to be the pivotal year where brands begin to push to make audience-based buying across TV and digital a generally more standardized practice and if deed that is what's happening although it's a little slower than we would like if you look at cross-platform advertising it's coming along but it's going fairly slowly this is looking the share of ad budget spent on cross-platform TV and video buys according to advertising agencies and marketers and this is coming from the IB and as you can see there's a slow movement upward from about 32 percent in 2015 to almost 40 percent in 2017 the problem is there's just a heck of a lot of work that we need to do because it's really the Nirvana we're looking for as we interviewed this guy Greg portal from AT&T he said the cross-platform video advertising is the Holy Grail I love this of surround sound marketing where we can have all these different devices and we can have the same content or related content that is going to be a real opportunity for marketers if they can grab it the only problem is MIT and I'm not talking about the University I'm talking about what is the M stand for you know what forget that it's technology it's it's um it's its its structure its inoperability you know when we think of different operating systems and then you have and you have iOS and and you have Android that's that's hard enough from a programming standpoint but then when you add in Roku devices and chromecast it gets really really complicated so operationally it's really hard to put all of this stuff together so we oh that's it we have a lack of measurement we have a lack of integration and we have a real problem with technology so we have a heck of a lot of work to do in order to sort this out but thankfully we are just in the process of releasing a report about this which you can see in a second it's called the cross-platform buying report what we happen to give it to anybody for free if you simply give me your card or Marisa who's in the audience right here and I think that's my ten minutes to summarize TV and what's happening in the US thank you very much please welcome Kellan smith Kenny with Steve Kovac won't you take the first seat yeah yeah if Dora decides okay so topic is post-crisis marketing and I think we have one of the best people here to talk about that Kelvin's from uber you know just in the last week let's just go over some of the headlines here we had order to halt services in Israel disclosure that last year there were 57 million accounts hacks and then just yesterday and today we have the ongoing trial between uber and wham-o and former employee even testified yesterday saying there is some kind of secret operation to spy on your competitors how are things going this is like Thanksgiving dinner yeah so you know it's interesting because I've I've been reflecting even on the word crisis as we were as we were chatting last week kind of in preparation today and and part of me felt like I don't I don't even know that that's the right word right when I think about crisis I think about death natural disaster I think what uber has faced although it has been epically challenging I think a bit more as a challenge than a crisis because what happens out of challenges you can really do that self-reflection that makes you better when I think about crisis I think about loss that you'll that you'll never recover from and when I think about where uber is and where we're headed well of course there have been a series of incidents that we are not proud of and we have to move on we have to acknowledge them we have to humbly admit that we have made mistakes and we are a hundred percent focused on doing the very best we can for our customers so when do you think this pipeline of the drip drip drip of one negative thing after another is gonna stop I mean again as recently as today right we're still getting some pretty nasty headlines I guess and and interesting news again of course I was under a lot of this was under the previous leadership when do you think this pipeline is gonna get cleared or do you think it would be better for you guys to just lay your cards out in the table and say here's everything we know instead of letting it drip out like that yeah it's it's such it's such a good question it's certainly one that I think about I do not have the crystal balls right now but but I will tell you I am more certain and more confident than ever that if things do drip out they will be things from the past because with daraa our nurse our new CEO with his arrival the tone tenor of the company has radically changed tell me how tell me tell me what he is messaging to you personally and just company-wide has been so you know as a marketing professional and I know I sort of lock arms with my friends in PR and my friends and brand he he was the first one to acknowledge PR marketing brand cannot fix this cannot fix this with better storytelling right he's like we have to change the story and he said that five days into the job and from the whole company he's like we have to radically fundamentally change the way this company operates and he's starting to put that into practice with some very impressive new hires were fortifying the HR team we we've also done I think a tremendous job of like really re-examine the cultural norms of the company need to be so we can be the type of company that our customers are infinitely proud to use and and you can just feel it it's like palpable inside the company there is a level of optimism even in the most recent headlines maybe people are not like oh you know people are like all right we're gonna do the right thing no matter what and so as some of these things like you said continue to trickle out about things that have happened in the past all we can do is control what we do about them today and how we face them going forward and making sure that there are no more unforced errors making sure that we are just deeply focused on what is the best thing for our customer and just showing level of humility right like he's gone out there and said we have made mistakes and that does not accept he went to London during that period so watch a little but let's give one example of that so there was the ban in London from he went out to London basically hat in hand and and how did that work out yeah you know it's it's interesting because the customers response to to his open letter to London was so powerfully positive it was just it felt great being inside the company and seeing look what happens when you are transparent look what happens when you take responsibility that wasn't a move that uber ever would have made pre daraa right just showing the maturity of the company made a real difference in addition to having our customers really respond favorably the City of London responded really favorably and you know we again I think have a bunch of optimism as as he continues to meet with leaders and he continues to spend time with a company about how we're gonna be as we as we look to the future so much of uber now is focused on what we can be for our customers and we're trying to do a lot less looking back so now in your role just this year obviously this year didn't go as you originally planned look at the 2017 what have you had to do to pivot or change your messaging as a marketer at for the consumer side we know what's going on internally now what about externally yeah you are correct when we when we when I think about the plan that we put together at the very end of 2016 in preparation for 2017 it's very different than what it looks like today I mentioned that when you face challenges right there's always an opportunity in there and and I had I had a team meeting where we talking about 2018 planning just on Monday and I had my leads go around and I said tell me what you're thankful for and almost universally people said I am thankful that we have as a company held the mirror up to ourselves and that we have an incredible opportunity to re-examine things that we never would have reexamined before and the first thing that comes to mind for me is how dedicated we are now to our cost I think before it's just this like runaway juggernaut of growth and we were like how do we grow how do we you know how do we get to more markets how do we get to more customers and now what I see people doing it's silly that this wasn't prioritized before but we said how do we give the customers that we have right now a hug how do we make them feel really proud not only to ride and drive on our platform but to invite other people to our platform I genuinely do not believe that would would have happened if we didn't get kind of stopped in our tracks right so it's very humbling so give me an example what you've done in the customer side - or writer side rather right so so one thing that's worth mentioning is when we talk about customers we do have this drivers and the writers yeah yeah and it's it's very difficult to talk to one without talking to the other because in order to have a flawless perfect uber experience we need for that delicate balance of riders and drivers to be at equilibrium if there are too many riders in a market that are that are demanding rides and sort of logging in and requesting then what ends up happening is the wait times are longer the prices go up and right or something like that on the flip side we've got some markets where we have more drivers than we then we have riders and the drivers are very frustrated cuz they're not busy so so everything we do when we when we try to like really listen to our drivers when we try to really listen to our riders it's this delicate balance of making sure that we're serving both sides of the marketplace equally but there was no secret sort of coming out of February that we had a major major reputational issue amongst driver in February why was February so significant I know but tell me so so some of you probably remember that there was this delete uber movement that happened at the tail end of January and that started to just surface a lot of questions around are we treating our drivers the right way and have we demonstrated a true respect and reverence for the people who move our platform and and our our drivers had said to us for four years now hey we want to be tipped we need better support we don't like the way the structure of payment is working for pool and so what we started to do in June was we took all that feedback in and as you guys know even in a fast-moving company like uber to address all of those concerns very very quickly is challenging but we rose to the occasion and starting in June we rolled out this campaign called 180 days of change and the 180 days maybe it was like a little inside baseball for all the you know mathematical nerds in the company I happened to be one of them for like the 180 degree turn but month by month we rolled out a new set of features that were in direct response to what our drivers said they needed to believe in our company again in the first month we rolled out tipping we had resisted tipping for years and why why was that's where was there so much friction there your rivals have been able to do it easily so it's a great question I think I think it was a number of things but so much of what it boiled down to is when we looked at the two-sided marketplace we said riders just love the magic of uber they love the simplicity and the elegance of push a button get a ride and then when your ride is over you just get out of the car there's no kind of fumbling around there's no checking out in the app and I think there was there was a nervousness around what if we introduced a little point of friction for riders how will they respond to that will that sort of drive them into the arms of a competitor and what we saw and and again the beautiful thing about consumer research was that riders said no no I want you to make it easy for me to attend drivers and right now I'm sort of fumbling around in my wallet because I this guy taking me to the airport I want to give him twenty anecdotally I myself have done that give him cash yeah that's right and so so when we decided that we were gonna build tipping in the app we said it has to live up to the magic the seamlessness and the flawlessness a Buber and so we tried to build a really magical tipping experience and and look where we are still not perfect but we're making it better and better and better with every iteration of the app so tipping one thing you're added for drivers what else 24/7 support phone support so they used to be able to get support 24/7 and the the ironic thing was there were always humans on the other end of that support only it was so robotic that people thought it was a bot so we almost had like the cost of humans right but married with like the the soullessness of computer so this support is if they have a billing problem or something like that anything for anything if they've been hit by another vehicle if they hadn't had an issue with one of their riders you know we really tried to roll out policies that were very much in service of of our drivers so that was the second month the third month we addressed pool we had drivers tell us look when I go from point A to point B and I have to make an extra stop to pick up another person along the way that's actually more work for me I want to get paid for that so we introduced this pool fee so that now each time they pick up an incremental rider they get a little something extra they're not just being paid for the route from from point A to point B and so lots of stuff going on the drivers probably more they would want first thing that comes to my mind full-time benefits a 401 K health insurance fowleri rates maybe is that going to happen you know it's interesting we we had a theory that that maybe drivers wanted hourly rates as well and after very intensive research the the drivers have told us they actually don't I bet they want health insurance they actually a lot of them don't so we'll talk about hourly rates for a sec one of the things that our drivers really like because it feels entrepreneurial because they are their own bosses they like knowing I can go out at a time when it's really busy and I can make a lot more or I can go out and sort of work in an hour where it's gonna be or in the center of the city when there's events and I can make a lot more they they worry about the downside of getting locked into this hourly this hourly payment the other thing is our drivers as you probably know they're independent contractors and so we we've also heard from drivers that they like that because there's this feeling of Independence there's this feeling of entrepreneurialism and one of the things that's interesting about our platform on both the driver and the rider side is that people tell us I'm really inspired by what uber enables right by moving humans all throughout cities I feel like I have opportunity and I feel like I own a stake my future that I wouldn't own without ever and so trying to kind of lock them in to a system where they didn't have the freedom to drive with us and and another ride sharing platform or to sort of require certain set hours which which are some of the things that would come if they weren't independent contractors is actually not super attractive to our drivers most of our drivers spend you know less than ten hours on the road they use it as a means to supplement income or they use it as a bridge between some of their full-time jobs so I'm asking one more question and I think we have a floating Mike around if in case there oh we do not have a floating Mike around just kidding there saying no I will just keep going then looks like we have about five more minutes so one thing we talked about this before a couple weeks ago me as a writer if I did a blind test and I took an uber and a lift I probably wouldn't notice much of a difference maybe in some cities I would how do you market to someone like me who has heard all these terrible things about uber they treat their employees their female employees terribly the this.x CEO was a jerk and and so forth how do you convince someone like me to come back to BRR when I can go to something that it's just equally as functional so as you can imagine as we we've been doing the internal soul-searching we have stood up in the past year a series of capabilities inside uber that I find you know incredibly incredibly encouraging and and one of the things that we've done we have folks who come from the political world who are helping us with polling so every single day we have our finger on the pulse of what people think about uber how they feel about uber what concerns they have about uber so we're operating in a world where we have lots and lots of information and we're highly responsive to to what's happening inside the market the most important thing that people tell us about the product is you have fundamentally changed the way I live and move in my city you are reliable you are efficient you are convenient you make me feel like I can move and places that I wouldn't have accessed if I had to do it in my own car if I had to use other forms of transportation and a lift or a get right so we actually do because of the scale and the size because of the scale and size of uber and also the fact that we you know operate in over 60 countries around the world people people are looking at us and they're saying no matter what city I kind of touched down in all around the world uber is there for me we have focus group conversations with customers riders will literally grab us by the collar and say don't screw this up you're too important so they they love the product they love the product and they do tell us that there are reliability differences that there are efficiency differences that there are affordable differences between us and our competitors but they've also said we want you to be a better company we want you to like really commit to your purpose in this world and so I'm very proud of some work that we have going on and it's it's very clear that there are things that we do that resonate deeply with customers the work we're doing with Mothers Against Drunk Driving the work we're doing to stop some of the the trafficking that that a lot of our drivers proactively see and report because we're delivering millions of rides in a week that's really resonating with people and we need to be doing more of that we need to be more supportive of our communities and more supportive of drivers but yeah people do say from a product perspective I experience a difference with the app uber feels a little bit more magical it feels a little bit more sophisticated though range of offerings the fact that you have black car service with professional drivers feels very different to me and there are times where I absolutely want to opt-in to that type of experience but they've said look the bar is rising we all know this the bar is rising for brands you have to rise to the occasion and as I think about some of the work that my team is doing we are getting much more sophisticated and how we get those messages to our customers at the exact right time so I'm gonna take us into overtime real quick I know you wanted to hit this - the technical challenge that you guys have just different local markets and you you're really passionate about this why don't you just talk about about for a little bit sure so one of the things that is that is most exciting as a marketer inside uber and I like to tell everyone I'm the the daughter of a mathematician and the niece of an artist because this explains a little bit about my my brain but we have a very unique challenge I can't think of a company that is more hyperlocal than uber we have to deliver door-to-door service within minutes to hundreds of cities all around the world and what that means is we have to get the exact right number of riders and drivers requesting to be matched with one another in each market and so when I first arrived at uber a year and a half ago we used to do a lot of national work right and it made our numbers look very sexy right we could show that all the efficiencies were working harder particularly because we as as folks inside the tech community in Silicon Valley were very mathematically and scientifically oriented but what we quickly noticed was that while those national metrics those efficiency metrics were looking good we actually could be throwing off the balance in certain cities and that was it was very terrible for our customers and so now what we do is we purchase a vast vast vast majority of our media hyper locally we build out individual cost curbs for hundreds of cities all around the world looking yeah we look at it by Channel and the other thing that we need to do right is we need to bake in what is the lab when you are acquire a new customer on the writer side and what is the lag on the driver side and how does seasonality impact that so there are some markets where it rains more than others that actually deeply impacts what happens with supply and demand same thing with drivers and riders our riders tend to move from sign up to first trip in days sometimes even hours but drivers can take weeks and months there's a really long and fat tail seasonality wise there are times as they're coming out of the summer right where there's less demand because people are on vacation but but drivers may be in between jobs and they're sort of looking for a summer gig so all of that gets baked into our models and in addition to just working on media and performance marketing we also work with our and colleagues on the marketplace team and we have this cross lover optimization where we make sure that we are funding both sides of the marketplace very strategically by market day in and day out so it's very exciting over 40 data scientists just in my organization alone to make sure that we keep our customers really happy and feeling like the experience on uber is flawless that's good all right we're gonna have to end it there at Kellan thank you so much thank you thanks guys please welcome Naveen rajdev with Jessica Smith all righty hello everyone my name is Jessica Smith I'm a senior research analyst with bi intelligence and today you know with Naveen who's CMO of Wipro which is a global transformation consulting and technology services firm that's got 160,000 employees serving clients in 77 countries and a good way to put that in people talk as they're helping companies stay ahead of digital transformation by identifying you know emerging technologies and deploy them at speed so for those of you who took a look at your agenda for today you'll notice that the title of this talk is called tomorrow casting so I want to kick this off by asking Naveen can you explain or define what tomorrow casting is and give us a little bit of a sense of what you mean by that sure so you know initially when this role was offered to me little over two and a half years ago as a CMO my initial reaction was I don't want it and you know coming from running PNL the reason being you know as I saw that or as we see we saw in the marketplace the disruption on technology the social behaviors how our customers how they were buying particularly on the technology how the technology was being part consumed implemented it was rapidly changing so you know just to take the role as a status quo would not have worked out very well at least that's what I believed in so I made sure that I have all the commitment from the organization and as I looked at it the importance of this role was that you know the way things were changing is like who will be buying from us two years from that point or at any point in time and who will be willing to work for us two years from that point and keeping that in mind you know it was all about that you know we need to essentially tomorrow cast the team we need to build the people we need to hire the people you know at a company level the culture we need to build has to focus on what is tomorrow so I'll give you one more data on that you know when you look at you know we all are familiar with Net Promoter scores and Net Promoter scores are very very common every organization does that now we were in top two a box of Net Promoter scores so which means everything is good we are delivering well our customers are happy but one question we asked ourselves that you know will your hungry customers are you hungry customers of today will be hungry it will be your happy customers after day will be hungry customers of tomorrow and that was the crucial point which helped us drive this and the other data points we looked at it is that you know entire marketing teams as it was running around not just ours but you know what I studied in the market they were running more towards loyalty base that you know ok he or she is my customer let's sell them more let's try to do that more and we know that you know loyalty programs hardly work you know and especially in the era where we live with passive loyalty of customers where customers change brands at any point in time they go you know I mean not just in b2b case but even in b2c case customers change their brand rapidly with that we felt that it was a it was a need to tomorrow cast it was need to start looking ahead in time and capture and and drive our entire discussion an entire mindset off not just marketing team but dude of the company to pick up those weaker signals from the market which can become trends tomorrow they are not yet trends and our goal was really are we were not looking at trends which were 10 years out or 5 years out and but we are looking at things which people can really look yeah you know I see some weaker signals this feels like happening you know and this can change the behavior and then asking ourselves a question so what does it mean for us and for our business and for our customers business and that's how we went ahead and implemented so that's tomorrow casting you know making sure you look at those not just happy customers but finding those hungry customers of tomorrow yeah and you you bring up an interesting point there in terms of tomorrow casting for loyalty because Wipro does exist in a pretty competitive space I mean it's little transformation every industry that you can think of is being transformed by some kind of emerging technology and if it's not it's probably falling behind so how are you playing tomorrow passing in terms of loyalty and how's that working out for you Oh in many many ways you know even we when we look at it so one was you know when you when you look at it so I'll tell you the the result of that you know that entire tomorrow casting was building up our digital business which is close to two point two billion dollars and it has been growing at twenty-five percent compounded annual growth rate so that definitely is working out as the traditional revenue when we look at some of the trends in terms of you know how I'll give one very simple trend which we adopted as as as marketers you know which is called print precious two years ago we went ahead and launched a magazine called will now it is targeted only at 2,000 of our top customer base we don't our idea was not to just go ahead and I mean we don't want to be a media company that's not our business that's not we we do but the idea was how do I change the talk in the company how do I make sure our people start to look at those weaker signals and pick up the trend so you know why print precious because we looked at one of the trends people take 3,000 pictures in a model they live Instagram life but they print those two or three pictures which are very precious to them and from that we started that you know what we're gonna print a magazine and oh it will be available only in print but we're gonna pour our heart and soul into it and curating the trend so it was not about just looking at a lot of data which existed for us but but how we looked at it was that you know where is this data leading to you know there was no preconceived question over there that you know this is what we are looking for but we looked at the data and we looked at those signs which kind of justified that oh yeah this could tilt in the future so we pick up we started to pick up trends and you know that magazine was kind of a classic case where I was asked by a lot of our executive team members that you know we are a digital company what's wrong with you why are you printing this and especially guy who comes from running P&L and becomes a CMO everybody questions so I went through it but today it is one of the best things where even our board members call us and say oh you do want to feature so-and-so person in this so that the idea was not to launch the magazine the idea was to change the conversations what we have so that was there was one simple example I will give you in that yeah great and you know in terms of mentioning the fact that you're using data to look at picking up the smaller signals to stay ahead of how your interactive interview tumors and the messaging that you're putting out there you also mentioned that you're pretty experienced driven in this and you actually mentioned on and one of our earlier chats that you have an internal team called mink of six people that really goes out there after those experiences to figure out what's going on on the ground and tries to deploy new technology is that you know the signals that you're picking up from the data might not necessarily indicate can you you know tell us a little bit about how sure finding the experience the data sure that's you know so that's that's that's kind of an interesting if we call it mink it stands for marketing innovation and creativity you know the idea was that I mean of course we have our own AI engine I can skim through any amount of data we want and they give us good trends and all that stuff but we want to do you know the human element of it how do you experience it and how do you how people are experiencing it and what does it mean for our business so we created a team calming they don't have a job description they just go out and meet a lot of people and I'll give you some examples you know they met a chef in in Toronto and Lauren Toyota and I mean she was an MTV VJ turned into a chef and she helped us define our social media path you know approach to the market which has worked out very well that in six months we went from where we were to roughly twelve hundred percent our social mean so other thing is you know a lot of our videos are actually curated by a monk who lives in the New York City and so yeah I mean you know they really go out and look for these newer things which would mean and which would mean something to us but something which is not so obvious for everyone you know we look at it we look at the authenticity in the voice we look I mean you know just from that example they go and challenge you know a lot of technology companies in terms of you know how their technology can be you know integrated into various things from a marketing standpoint so that's that's what it is one of them is right here Chris so you started mink the mink team of just about two years ago and you only became CML 2.5 years ago and this kind of brings me to an interesting concept that you'd brought up of tomorrow casting eight quarters at a time so you know instead of looking at the broad long long arm the long arc of digital disruption kind of looking at a more manageable to your time frame and looking at what that means for a marketer because that makes it much more tangible much more realistic so you started mink right into your tenure and so your we've already come eight quarters and we're about to you know what what what are the next eight quarters look for you and how do you plan to you know apply tomorrow casting in terms of what what's to come next you have any other teams that you're gonna launch any other major strategies that you're gonna roll yeah so you know if I look into eight quarters I mean if I remain the CMO though you know from our company's two perspective on the longest-serving CMO graduation thank you I don't know you know from that because I don't think it's a you know the CMO is the right word but I think we all are customer evangelists that's how I take my role you know into the company coming from businesses so I'll you know if I look at next eight quarters I think looking into the trends where things are going one or two things I would if I you know I let audience judge I think it's not a particular technology which will you know it'll be a combination of technology you know a I and everything you know a are we are you experience all that stuff data analysis but I think it's the human mode into the technology which will get in and that's what we believe in you know if you look at things like betterment you know the app which went down to disrupt the entire what you call the the financial adviser ecosystem you know they have in they have started human mode you know where you can pay extra and talk to a human when you look at I mean there are there are so many you know other things you know there when you when you look at it I mean we hear the talk about açai is going to disrupt by 2020 twenty eighty percent of the jobs will be gone because of it you know everything back office will be gone I'll say you know is this that some companies trying to push their software out there or is this a reality because there are a lot of these weaker signals like betterment which are out there or things like human libraries which we look at it you know where the most precious thing is people want to talk to a human so we we look at those friends and I think eight quarters down the line so our approach to the technologies make it more human make it more invisible use AI to make it more invisible so that you know the touch interface goes away that's how we look at it those are the things which if I were to do eight quarters none I'll make technology more invisible the other thing I I definitely wanted to put it out is real CMOS have not been worried about cybersecurity you know because it is someone some forensic team some CIO some CIS so if I every if I'm a customer evangelist in a company why shouldn't I be worried about my customer experience you know from cyber security standpoint my customers don't touch our you know touch any app or anything you know for I'm not my customer but any ones customer for that matter if we don't start to if marketers don't start to think in that way how to push that out so I think some of those top of my mind you know at this point in time yeah so what what are you paying attention to most if you had to pick between cybersecurity and AI as the thing that you're really gonna is gonna keep you up at night over the next year with which one of those so yeah is a reality let me let me throw one data point you know to the audience and let them judge what do they want to use AI for 95% of the jobs like electricians motor drivers carpenters they are mostly men roughly 93 percent of the jobs which are preschool teachers nurses social workers are held by women you decide where you want to apply and what you can displace with that I think AI we will certainly bet on it but the AI will become more and more it will be driven more towards emotional intelligence I think the combination of human mode and AI will go together you know going forward I would bet on AI but more but I would say it will go together with human mode not with not just alone as yeah so we've got about two to three minutes left and I wanted to open the floor see if there are any questions from the audience based on tomorrow casting and how to apply that as a marketer I think you explained it so yeah I think hahaha everyone has a great concept of tomorrow casting is prepared for the eight quarters ahead great so yeah any any final words for us no that's it thank you thank you for having me I absolutely enjoyed I'll be writing a lot about tomorrow casting because it's it's a it's it's a fundamentally different approach to how you look at marketing we have found it very hard to change the mindset of our teams because it is not just very easy for anyone to you know start looking for the future I mean everybody goes and reads about trends but to really look at those weaker things where they before they become trends is really tricky and we have spent enormous amount of time and energy in doing that it's paying us off for sure so somebody has a question file so I mean some of the examples I gave you know like we pick up like as I talked about earlier you know like print precious you know as we saw book sales on Amazon physical book sales were going up people were printing you know you you see certain pictures and magazines and otherwise and see that you know people are printing pictures but they are like they're printing like which are very precious to them or when you look at you know when you look at the data like this that AI you know what what is wrong all of a sudden with better men that they came out with a human mode that's you pick up few more signals like this and then it makes you feel like okay you know I think this is where the market will start to tilt but at this point in time if I would say it is very early but if you start to pick it up and shift your conversation on that side especially when you are helping customers implement a lot of digital technologies I think that's it has a payoff okay looks like you so much essence thanks for your time Thank You Dean thank you please welcome Tina Sharkey with Mike shields all right good afternoon again Tina so I've known you for a long time I always think of you as a medium marketing person now you're this celebrated entrepreneur I think I think people have probably heard a little bit about brand lists maybe not everybody knows what it is so I'd love to get into just tell us like the what that give us the concepts give us with the business opportunity to see and maybe where this where this idea come from so just for context I thought it was funny to be in a marketing channel as brand las' but to be clear like friendless is unapologetically a brand we're just reimagining what it means to be one so I just want to like quickly set the playing field straight that we're not anti brand we're not generic we're not private label we're not any of those things my co-founder you know Leffler and I and I think I'll let a video tell a little bit of this story but we decided that first of all having been sort of a serial entrepreneur and also in media I for my next thing I really wanted to do something that mattered and had impact and I wanted to do it with people that I really wanted to work with and so in meeting my co-founder I realized our vision because I did a tour of duty after my last media company that I ran which was BabyCenter that I wanted to build something that actually had scale had a massive addressable audience and felt like it could actually be for profit and for purpose and can impact basically everybody every single day so it was like a very small order that I set out for myself in terms of how to think about what what would be interesting to do you just wanted to reach everybody I wanted to reach everybody but I did want to do it for media anymore I wanted to do it through actual things that would change people's lives and I did a tour of duty in venture capital and I still am sort of an active angel and an investor and I was seeing so many like what I would call feature or product ideas but not platform and scale and disruptive like new industry reimagine ation and so rather than just coaching that I felt that with the right co-founder we could actually do it and so the backstory to the video your see he's really about the idea that we came to New York I think probably last February or March and we brief between March and July 11th about sixty journalists under embargo on to what we were doing Wow and so we really impressive to the media that nobody leaked this secret yeah and that everything was going alive on 7-eleven little did I know that that was also Amazon Prime day and free Slurpee day at 7-eleven in case your calendars weren't marked yeah so I thought oh my okay here we go but having done that Ito gave me a call a couple of weeks before the launch and said I can't believe we didn't record all of those meetings because after the third meeting every meeting went the same way we told people what we were doing we felt we were trying to make sense of modern consumption that it was super broken and that we were going to reimagine everything but we're gonna do direct to consumer relationships creating the most extraordinary products starting with the things that people reach for every day but using a filter based on values organics non-gmo kosher at times vegan gluten-free everything being sustainably sourced etc etc and everything that we were doing was gonna start at one price and so we studied the better-for-you market and the entry price for that market was pretty high and very exploitive you want to get organic you want to get stuff that's there's a premium our brands pay for that and there's a conception that that premium is actually you're paying for more and you're getting more but the truth is better doesn't have to cost more and the second truth is that very few people have access to those things but these are not in each ideas these are not coastal ideas these are not things that only people in New York and San Francisco want to use these are things that everybody wants to use every day but either they don't have access to it they can't find it or the price point is unaffordable and you're probably getting this but what do you want the things you're talking about are what they're every day starting with what we call everyday essentials so for those of you know the supermarket category the outside of the store is is the perimeter and that is what's all perishable frozen fresh etc yeah the center of the store is everything that is non perishable so there's roughly in an average supermarket like 20,000 SKUs in a big like a Super Target you'd probably get 50,000 so we're dealing with all of us being frozen in the paradox of choice there's overconsumption there's overproduction and you go to Target there's 50 feet of salad dressing what are you gonna use so we wanted to edit it down we wanted to simplify it for everybody and we wanted to produce just what matters by category and just what matters for feminine-hygiene is not the same adjustment matters for food which is not just what matters for beauty as an example or personal care so we decided to reimagine all of it and produce everything that is non GMO organic vegan gluten-free better for you clean Beauty phalli free sulfate free no animal testing etc and everything that we sell and create is three dollars some are two for three and some are three for three and it's only available at brand luscom I have many questions but you want to jump into the video so we told all these journalists you know and I at that point after the third meeting we realized that we were really disrupting in a way that we hadn't expected the journalists to react to so the meetings went over and over the same way where there was shock and awe when we actually revealed a price so we don't gave me a call a couple of weeks before the launch and said I can't believe we didn't record those meetings I said well you know you really don't record journalists it's kind of the other way around right but I have an idea so we put an ad in Craigslist we asked for actors to come to a stealth San Francisco food startup to do some tastings the only reason we thought actors was we only had two weeks until the launch and we thought they might have better facial expressions because we really had no time and we made this video that's our office they're walking in and order to no idea so what we've got here we've got some drinks we've got coffee and tea Vern Ola we've got candy some quinoa snacks there's so much flavour think non-gmo organic certified Fairtrade no preservatives no artificial colors and artificial flavors I'm gonna need like a bag of those I have one more thing to show you follow me come on in now what if I was to tell you everything made by brainless was just three bucks three bucks what shut away no I have three dollars this whole thing three dollars three bucks that's unbelievable all the good stuff none of the bad stuff so same thing happened it was basically like we told people that we moved the weekend to Wednesday Thursday like it's so crazy that they just couldn't actually believe that we could produce all this because we've been trained to believe that better needs to cost more we've been trained to believe that if you came for more it's better quality and we've been trained to believe that there's a relationship between price and value and that's actually not true so that's interesting because I think a lot of the stories that came out or the where my mind went or when I read about you guys was this you're doing the you're doing the Casper the Warby Parker thing where you're saying you know all that marketing that goes into jiff versus Peter Pan peanut butter that's like a lot of waste of money and people to pay for that and this is really for like you can buy all that stuff for cheap and not have to be from the marketing cost it was less about I want to be I want to do good for the world is that are you gonna be able to is that part of the appeal are you the Procter & Gamble without the marketing platform Campbell doesn't have any direct to consumer relationships right so Procter and Gamble's customer are chained so they're there they're online they're offline their stores their clubs etc but they don't actually work with consumers so yes absolutely the idea is to work directly with consumers and we are a community first and we're a community of people who deserve it better and we eliminated what we call the brand tax so when we say the brand tax what do we actually mean by brand tax we mean that all the inefficiencies from the time that you put organic tomato sauce in a bottle and put that plate on your table at home with pasta with organic pasta that you love and so everything in between from the wholesale to retail when you actually go into the better-for-you market you likely don't sell directly to those stores like Whole Foods and others you likely sell to a distributor and they take their piece then you decide you want to be in a certain shelf and then you pay for that thing and oh by the way there's already somebody on that shelf so can you remove that inventory then you pay for breakage fees and settlement fees and all these things before that sauce ever comes home right that's just a ridiculous it doesn't need to be like that anymore and so reimagining what that means is building an assortment starting with everyday essentials this is my co-founder EDA Leffler we're in the Bradley's lab in our office in San Francisco but was reimagining how people are feeling today so if this is a marketing track it was really starting with the consumer insight who is that new consumer who is that whether they're a millennial because the largest percentage of parents today are Millennials and obviously only growing or whether they're a perennial meaning they have a modern mindset it doesn't matter what their age is they actually want to shop their values and they want to live with a new filter of how they think about it gone are the nights on Sundays where you go with your mom up and down the grocery aisle people are actually shopping at 5 to 10 places a month and they actually care what companies they do business with and they care the companies are socially responsible and they've rejected the brands they grew up with they don't want it to use their parents toothpaste their parents dish soap their parents pasta sauce the things that you know we didn't want to be the ones to tell them that the Jolly Green Giant didn't act pick their beans and that mr. Whipple is an actor and you know all of those things that the madman sort of grew up with soap operas were created by the soap companies that was the vehicle but now the cameras turned back on to consumers and there's a billion individual voices that have their own networks a brand is not what we used to create as marketers a brand is what a friend tells a friend and so if that's the case and you want to be in direct relationship you have to act like one you have to act like somebody I want to be in a relationship with so yes when you check out at brand lists not only are you saving on average 40% off of national brands of similar quality but we are also working with feeding the hungry because not everybody has $3 and so that's not a campaign yesterday was givingtuesday today for us is giving Wednesday tomorrow we'll be giving Thursday when you check out at bran less calm we give a meal if you're a member we give 2 when you join our membership which is not necessary we give 10 when there were fires in Texas we stand up and we help fires in Northern California hurricanes in Texas hurricanes in Florida we just act like you would act if you were a friend and the media responded the media said we were PNG but we're not because we're starting with everyday essentials but it's gonna be so much more than that we're eliminating the brand tags from things that don't need to cost more and on the back of every single product it talks about putting people first and asking people to join our community because it really is a community of that because when brands typically talk about I want to go direct to consumer it's much more about I don't want to get disintermediated if anymore by my wholesaler or the stores I sell to and I want I want people to give me stuff give me data tell me who you are so I can get you more that's that's I'm sure that's part of what your business project objective is but more it's more about getting them in this club and feeling part of a membership and they're doing good yeah I think it's about you know the doing that matters we just heard a talk about AI and the last you know the closing remarks were about putting the human into everything so companies if they want to be in directly relationship with people they need to act like people and they have to you want right and so if we have an opportunity to talk to people we're not gonna make up fake stories in a false narrative we're gonna talk about the doing that matters we're gonna launch field guides to like tangible acts of kindness we're gonna drop PDFs on you know clubs that you can join to go with your friends to a food bank we're gonna talk about you know giving and doing and being engaged in modern society and to the society we believe in we're not gonna wait for the government to fix it we're gonna go outside the system as entrepreneurs and build the kind of society we care about so what do you think what do you the Procter gamble isn't J&J is the world view that were that made their business on telling stories about peanut butter and soap and shampoo that really maybe maybe mattered or maybe really didn't what are they what are they do with this with this new reality you know they need to retool massively you know of the top CP top hundred CPG brands in the US last year ninety were in decline that's 90 percent by my math so that's kind of scary what we're seeing it's just a major turnover of the portfolio so what is the Unilever Xin P&G doing I couldn't tell you what their strategies are but last I checked you know Kellogg's just brought a new bar company and Nestle just bought Blue Bottle coffee and believer and just bought Dollar Shave and seventh-generation like they're turning over their portfolios and they're bringing in new talent and they're reimagining you know their portfolios because the brands that people grow up with are no longer relevant or authentic right they're not trust marks in the way that they once might have been thought of thinking I got to ask you how do you make sure that Amazon doesn't just take you out just do this copy it bury you like they like to do these kind of things what do you you know it's funny but I find that is the greatest compliment and flattery that you know the idea that Jeff Bezos wakes up worrying about me but should that be the case you know I'm a songs extraordinary I'm on Amazon every day and if I know exactly what I want the likelihood is Amazon will likely have it the problem is if I search up shampoo on Amazon I get 20,000 results now that is paralyzing I mean we all understand what the paradox of choices you know that's just too much choice so sorting through all of that what we've done is we've edited it down and so it's just what matters we don't we have one shampoo maybe we'll have two or three but it's clean it's valeted free and sulfate free and not animal tested and it's three bucks and so clean Beauty for three dollars is a different way of thinking about an entire entirely way of stocking your bathroom your personal care etc etc but we're not the only brand tax free company I mean I think that you just talked about Dollar Shave Club when Michael built Dollar Shave Club you know he built a brand tax free company he said you don't need to buy these other blades our blades are awesome and he built two rec relationships with consumers and they staffed up their customer service teams to be social media evangelists so they can be in direct relationship I was chatting with you know you might have seen the chui acquisition by Pet Smart a couple of months ago and I was chatting with one of the finance leaders there if you knew what they spent on flowers you wouldn't believe it now why would a pet dog food company be buying flowers that would never cross the mind of a traditional pet food company but the answer is that if you are a what I'll call like a subscriber to pet food and unfortunately like all events in the cycle of life in your pet passes and you have to cancel that subscription likely they get a phone call well the thing that a friend would do just go on Facebook and see who's whose friend has lost a pet recently and I have an awesome dog Tessa and you know I know that just like everything in life she's not going to live forever but like they act like a human being sure and so it's that kind of retooling that's not a campaign that would be an offensive campaign it's just the way people act if you're actually in relationship with people right and so I think that it's thinking about things in a very different way it's thinking about the conversations that you're having it's thinking about like this entire assortment and it's much much bigger than this this is just an overview of some of the things on Brandes everything here is all the food is non-gmo most of it is organic all the beauty and personal care is clean all of the cleaners and we also have you know multi-surface cleaner toilet bowl cleaner etc those are EPA safer choice certified and everything here is three dollars and many of the things on here are 2 for 3 or 3 for 3 so and we are in direct relationship with the people that we sell our self to plus as you've seen here everything is transparent so we don't waste our time with you know Italian you know illustrations of men and gondolas in Venice going up and down you know the canals to suggest that it's tomato sauce like if it's gluten-free muffin makes we tell you or if it's virgin olive oil or coconut oil it's organic it's you know it tells you everything about it and just what you need to know because the story is yours not ours right and so we don't want to create false narrative we actually want to leave white space we actually trademark the white box so that other people could fill in and not us alright I'm getting to wrap it up signal so I have to say Thank You Tina thanks for taking us through all this this awesome new product and taking attempt to come out here thanks everybody you please welcome Denise Karkos with Shireen Pathak all right I'm trying Pat took him to coax like a better to say media I'm so excited to be joined by Denis Karkos and I wanted to start with a question which is simple question but how many of you and be honest here are kind of confused when I say the word or the term AI none of you are confused Savion all of you should be up here because we're kind of confused this is why we're gonna talk about it today I like the title of the session yeah it's not a four-letter word because they think that I often feel like a lot of people did a big find under place on big data on all their briefs in the last year and just put an AI in there instead but we're gonna spend the next thing 15 20 minutes talking a little bit about actionable real structured ways that you have used AI in marketing and I thought we could start actually with what you what you have done and how you've kind of thought about it sure and then we can go a little bit into why you did it yeah well I I'd say that um so I'm Denise Karkos nice to meet you guys and I'd say I get the privilege of spending a lot of time with other CMOS and learning quite a bit you know to be honest like the good and the bad we've got a contingent of us that embrace the latest trend and that's what we talk about for forever and contingent of us who say that's just a fad and let's think you know maybe what's what's coming next and I kind of feel that way about programmatic and content and the there's all these buzzwords that we all kind of get to a point where we roll our eyes it's not that they're not effective parts of how to be a good marketer they all are we have to really embrace them but I don't think about AI in the same light that it's just a fine and replace you know I I feel like AI is something much bigger it's an effective marketing tactic but it is a way to really pivot on your business and it really helps a more you know of the CML is who want to be contemporary CMOS or driving enterprise growth you cannot ignore AI and actually I was thinking about this as we were kind of waiting in the corner which we should get an award for inhales for minutes and one of the things I was thinking about was I was working at Hill Holiday as an assistant media planner in the mid 90s when you know digital advertising was was born and all my clients were asking me about it and I had two options one was just to hide because I had no idea what they were talking about and the other option was to just embrace it and my tact at the time was that the only people who knew what they were talking about were the sales folks the DoubleClick's the AOL's the Yahoo's and I embraced that whole community and they taught me so much and I kind of feel like it's that era again where you know embracing the IBM's or whomever to really understand AI intrinsically is really I think important for all of us because it is going to have such a such a big impact so I could talk about a couple examples of things were doing would be great right you want to have the video first let me give you a little bit of context and then we'll tee it up just a minute and a half video so we are definitely you know a tech forward company at TD Ameritrade we see ourselves as one of the original fin tech disruptors and you know to be honest you have we maybe lost a little off the fastball as all these robos are coming up and disrupting this space and I believe that's a great competitive threat for us and so we're awakened and we're ready and we believe that AI is one of the components that we really should embrace as a company and I'll talk a little bit more strategically as to the impact I believe we could have in the future but it hasn't shot us away from testing and learning into smaller applications so to the examples that I'm going to highlight in this video one was around our when we launched our own Robo to compete with these upstarts one of the things we wanted to do is really recognize the audience of being younger and maybe not really savvy in finance and how do we really engage that audience in a meaningful way so what we did was we partnered with IBM Watson and we went into people's Facebook feeds and invited them into a conversation and when they engaged with us we were able to talk to them about not finance but about your personality and what your social profile says about you and with their permission we talked about how that is the bridge to an investing style and it's a much more accessible way to have a conversation with a younger generation about finances and probably to be honest any generation it's a pretty inert category and you know you got to do it but you don't really want to learn about it so we launched a program where we would define people's investing styles and we'd actually have a companion avatar that looks like you that you could use as your profile pic so that was one way to really take the bridge from social media using AI to glean as much about the person and talk to them what their investing style and push them over to what product might be best for them the second piece that will be highlighted in here is we have the most free education sexy stuff free education around finance but believe me if you are interested in learning control of your financial future we have just a great repository of information for you but my gosh if you could find it you know it's a challenge because there is so much of it and you know I just heard the previous speaker talking about you going to Amazon you search shampoo you get you know 50,000 results I feel like that's that's not with education so what we've been doing in is taking the AI technology and applying it to curate our educational content with voice and text interaction so when someone comes on and they are actively looking for information to help them place a trade or understand what iron Condor is that they can they can talk to our AI application and again it's more human and that's incredibly important to talk about okay not what's your risk tolerance because then we're just taking the same old stuff and putting it into AI and that's not what this is about this is about AI listening to the tone of your voice your confidence level how quickly can you answer questions and asking questions like when you travel do you have to be a hundred percent buttoned up and prepared your itineraries locked or you can you be more like throwing a backpack and just wing it that's a risk tolerance question but seven a much more human way so that is something that's in beta so we'll show the video and I'll talk about the results of these two things they'll get in the bag um after the video I got the applause um I wanted to talk a little bit about because I think that the idea of AI for a lot of marketers is still placed insert the experimental budget and I don't think that's a bad thing which means things often don't go as planned I wouldn't talk a little bit about sort of how you're seeing AI is the thing you can just test and okay to fail it's been a while and I always like to hear about failure yeah I definitely so when I had a funny interaction I was walking down the hall to my office and past my CEO who had just read a pre mail deck that I had sent to him and in it in fine print was that something that we tested had a 98% suppression over the control so 90% fail rate and she stopped me and said did I read that right did you do something that was 90% underperforming against the control I said yeah yes that's a big failure I said yeah and he said that's awesome so it's admitting that when you try something it doesn't work and learning from it and moving on and hoping not making the same mistake twice but it's great to have a culture from the very top where and that's actually a good conversation to be stopped in the hallway by your CEO and not a bad one and with these two examples I'd say we learned a lot so with the robo-one with the avatar we launched that to both our own clients on facebook as well as prospects and like anything we do we figure you're going to have a higher affinity for your clients and get a more engagement rate with them and in fact it was the opposite prospects reacted from an engagement perspective three times stronger than the client population and the learning there from us was that these are clients they know you're talking to them as a client and you're asking them more information and yet they've invited you into their Facebook feed shouldn't you know all these things what you're asking about me so it was actually off-putting to our clients and it's funny how some of the stuff students intuitive later but it wasn't to us we figured you know traditional marketing markets your clients it's easier it's cheaper and you'll get more engagement opposite was true in this case but we did have you know a good almost 20,000 people go through the profile and engage with the product so it pockets of success but pockets of learning which I always find more interesting with the education that's something where I hold myself accountable for the first mistake because it was one of the first things we were doing with AI and because our CEO was so excited about technology and everything that that brings I you know marched my team into his office proudly showing them off and saying show you know him what we've got and he was all excited about it and it's currently in beta and that conversation was over a year ago so my learning is that these things take time what the reason we launched it slowly was because we're very focused on researching things before we put them out into the wild and we did this and in research we found that 50 percent of the users you interacted with their voice which is important because the creation of the education content is done through you know a fun question answer my vacation example but it's also that as you remember the tone of your voice and your confidence level and the cadence of how you answer questions and that was a really interesting layer to me can you understand investors confidence and then curate content accordingly in am testing 50 percent use the voice in beta less than 20 percent of the people did and if you think about it you know in the wild you're on a subway and are you really going to be talking about finances into your film but in a testing lab I'm sure so we had to slow things down figure out you know other ways to map a social profile into the content feed so we had more texture to the data so again another learning slowed it down we're gonna do it right and we're going to make sure that we can figure out a way to get that voice or other sources so when one thing is also the category you're in is especially interesting for things to do they I because I think that there is a there's another big inclination to try and do things that might be come off as stunty or gimmicky and fine that might be okay for other types of brands in finance you're talking about a subject that's already very personal it's really kind of taboo you know there's a lot of things that you sort of think differently about when it comes to money were there any considerations of using kind of a relatively very new technology and kind of putting it in your category versus if you'd been I don't know selling soap yeah well it's funny we talk about that all the time you know going from campaigns to conversations and and we really need to do that in the financial services category where according to Edelman you know the financial services Trust Barometer we're last you know we're chemicals it's like three ahead of us we've got a long road to climb so you you can't be you know stunty or gimmicky and as we all know regardless your category the consumer is completely in charge and will really make sure that you know that you're not going down the right path so I'm a big believer in trying to tell whether anything to be honest I think we do have a little bit you need in the examples I showed you know it is a little you know stunty campaign ii but we we didn't do it to insult the customers intelligence we did it to learn and to grow from it yeah do you do you think about sort of using AI sort of internally when you've we've talked about this you 10,000 employees and I think a lot of a lot of sort of the more interesting use cases to me of AI have been the non consumer facing what the ones that are actually changing the way companies can operate again especially in your category where robos are coming but the humans are still needed yeah so there's an interesting tension there where it is kind of your dream use case yeah well I think what's what I love about that question I also managed corporate and public affairs so internal associate communications has always been a passion because as a marketer that's the first place you should be showcasing and pre-launching everything that you do because it builds excitement but now I'm machine control of it which is really fun but we are currently merging with Scott rates who are going from a 6,000 associate base to about 10,000 and there's no better impetus for improving our internal communications and dissemination of information especially through a conversion than now and you know I read somewhere that 75% of a company's intellectual capital is locked up in emails and attachments and therefore really not descent into some enable and utilize so that's why everyone's on their phone right now right they're trying to find you know and also this is another stat in there 76% of your time as an associate is spent analyzing or trying to find day so if you just put those facts down it's like you know it's true because you are either looking for something when's the holiday party where is that what should I wear or what how many you know revenue how much revenue did we get last month there's all sorts of questions that you have every single day as someone who's trying to drive business so if I back it up one step I'd say that the mission and the marching orders from my boss to me as chief marketing officer is to we're an enterprise mindset and wear that hat and I take that very seriously so I am now have the ability to try to really drive enterprise growth there are no barriers to my job title which is such a gift but I don't see that it is for me I see that for the 250 people that work for me so I was able for my one-on-one with my boss where we talked about that HBR article that was out the trouble with CMOS which talks about which CMO are you and the smallest sliver is someone who runs a P&L try his enterprise growth and yet that's the pursuit of all of us and that's the expectation of my boss so I was able to talk to my entire department and say this is this is his expectation of me but this is this expectation of us and how can I expect my entire team to operate a level up more strategically looking for pockets of growth when they are working with archaic systems trying to understand when one's payday or you know I don't know what you know how many how many trades to be do yesterday and who has that information can you imagine a world we apply AI internally and at the click of a button or the sound of your voice you can interact with something where you can just ask those questions and not have to have a bunch of analysts pulling reports and all over the company I mean my analysts would love me because they don't today because I have a million questions for them because we're all curious and just to make that such a frictionless process to be able to have things that your fingertips and that's here if you can figure out how to navigate it digitize all that information and then empower the associate then they can be freed up to think to strategically and then they can really drive that's the intelligence part of that artificial what I'm getting the signal to wrap up but I wasn't asked what your sort of absolute dream scenario for implementing AI as a marketer woody yeah well it's interesting I am a big fan of believing in kind of the classic marketing principles and it's so interesting to hear the last speaker because she does not believe in them anymore and and you know she's she's likely correct and I think where I get excited is to think about modern technologies and how that takes classic marketing principles and builds a new norm that none of us know yet so I just really really want AI to free us up I'll end by saying that I had a boss once that it was asking me to deliver something that I just didn't have the time for and I said okay I'll stay all night and I was 23 and I'm stay all night and he just said to me there's never gonna be more hours in the day you just have to work smarter and I kind of believed AI is almost gonna give you more hours in the day so please join us in the Getti lounge for a short break programming will resume shortly in the Columbus room
