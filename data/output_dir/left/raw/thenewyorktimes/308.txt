1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,260
There’s a time and
place for a political debate.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,442
But now is the
time to unite as a country.

3
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:16,400
I don’t want to get into
that debate right now.

4
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,050
There will be an absolute
appropriate time for us

5
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,000
to talk about
policies and politics.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,310
I’m sure that folks will want
to score political points

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,310
off this tragedy.

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,110
But I think we need
to wait.

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,180
Before we begin to advocate for new laws,

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,730
I think it is eminently
fair to say, how are we

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,530
doing enforcing the ones we
currently have.

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,510
Had the Obama administration simply followed
federal law, and enforced the law

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,970
existing gun laws made
it illegal for the Sutherland Springs

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,570
shooter to
buy a gun.

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,170
And all you hear now is let’s have new
laws, new laws, when we don’t

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,100
enforce the laws we have.

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,500
We will lift the victims and their families and the entire community

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,730
in prayer.

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,300
Scripture says ...

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,990
They’re just sick people.

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,400
They are mentally imbalanced.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,300
How do we make sure that
individuals with mental illness

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,890
do not touch a gun.

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,670
Often underneath this is a
diagnosis of mental illness.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,130
We are committed to working
with state and local leaders

26
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,260
to help secure our schools
and tackle the difficult issue

27
00:02:02,260 --> 00:00:00,000
of mental health.
