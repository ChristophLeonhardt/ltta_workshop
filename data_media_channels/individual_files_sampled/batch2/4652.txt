years from here in DC to Tel Aviv to Seoul to London all praising John McCain who is being received his death the news of his death honored from around the world so what's going on at the White House well the Washington Post is you may have seen now reporting that there was a statement not just a tweet that the president wrote but even more reportedly praising the senator calling him a hero but President Trump apparently didn't want to released the White House did lower the flag Saturday after news of the Senators death came out and as you can see though it is back to full staff this morning it was actually shot if you look just behind it you can see the flags over by the Washington Monument there as well let me bring in Hans Nichols who's back with us Hans listen yeah clearly these men had a strained relationship from this jar Donald Trump going after John McCain days after announcing the start of his candidacy I mean this dates back to July of 2015 if not before then right you know there was a lot of talk this morning about what a fighter John McCain was but with President Trump he was remarkably restrained he never really counterpunched he never really hit back that much at President Trump while he was alive in the Senate there were clear policy differences yes their personality differences and we hashed those out this morning but there's so many policy differences in ways that McCain represented the traditional Republican view great skepticism towards Russia which wasn't shared by this president so you know when we get back and forth on the policy I know we talked to mark Salter earlier this morning he's perhaps McCain's closest aide almost like a son to him Salter didn't necessarily want him to turn this into McCain versus Trump but there are personality differences but the policy ones are lasting and the question is what direction is the Republican Party going to go is gonna go with the Romney McCain view on Russia or is it going to embrace the Trump view and I think we have that Salter bite that you referenced ons ready to go mark Salter talking this morning on the Today Show regarding as Hahn said this idea that nobody around John McCain inside his orbit wants to make this into a story about President Trump listen I'm gonna try very hard not to think or talk about Donald Trump for this week and just do what I can to help make sure that John is buried with the honors and decorum he's earned from years of faithful service to his country thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
