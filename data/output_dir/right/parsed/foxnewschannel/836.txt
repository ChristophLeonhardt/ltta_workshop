STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE.
WE ARE HAVING A PARTY HERE.
IMMIGRATION IS ON THE AGENDA
AGAIN.
THEY WILL SEE IF THEY CAN HUSH
OUT THE DEAL.
BIG BUSINESS JUMPED ON DATA
SHOWING THERE ARE MORE JOB
VACANCY THEN PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED.
THERE IS ONE PROBLEM, WE STILL
HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST LABOR
PARTICIPATION IN THE WESTERN
WORLD.
IF WE HAD THE U.K.'S RATE THAT
WOULD MEAN MILLIONS MORE
AMERICANS AT WORK.
INSTEAD OF LAZY IMPORTING
FOREIGN WORKERS WHY NOT TRAIN
AMERICAN WORKERS SO THEY CAN
TAKE THE JOB THE BOOMING ECONOMY
IS CREATING.
ALSO YOUR FAVORITE TOPIC, CAN WE
START WITH THE SADLY PREDICTABLE
RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS.
THAT MEANS WE NEED MORE
IMMIGRATION.
>> IT'S STRANGE, IT'S THE ONE
THING VERY RICH PEOPLE DON'T
BRAG ABOUT.
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE BRAG ABOUT
HOW EXPENSIVE THEIR CARS ARE AND
WINE IS.
THE ONE THING THEY DON'T WANT TO
BRAG ABOUT IS HUMAN LABOR.
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT.
THEY JUST WANT CHEAPER AND
CHEAPER LABOR AND THERE IS NO
BETTER EXAMPLE OF YOUR SWAMP
THEN THE FACT THAT THE SIGNATURE
ISSUE THAT THIS HISTORIC
CANDIDATE RAN ON.
THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE ARE
DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE TRYING
TO PUSH THROUGH AMNESTY.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CALL THIS
AMNESTY.
STEVE: OKAY, LET'S SORT OF GO
OVER THE POLICY THING HERE.
THIS IS THE LAY
THIS IS THE LABOR PARTICIPATION.
WHEN THE ECONOMY GROWS RAPIDLY
THERE IS A CRUNCH AND YOU HEAR
WE CAN'T FIND WORKERS.
THAT'S TRUE.
WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE SITTING
ON THE SIDELINES.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS FALLING
BUT LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE
ISN'T CHANGING.
PEOPLE WHO
RATES UP.
PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT
THEMSELVES AND THEY CONTRIBUTE.
YOU DON'T SPEND AS MUCH ON
WELFARE AND GIVE A HANDOUT ALL
OF THE TIME.
>> IMMIGRATION GOES HAND AND
GLOVE WITH THIS.
YOU HAVE THE SECRETARY OF
HOMELAND SECURITY TODAY SAYING
THEY ARE NOT COMING IN THE PORT
OF ENTRY BUT BETWEEN.
WE ALSO HAD THE DEBATE OF
WHETHER WE SHOULD SPEND 25
BILLION BUILDING A WALL TO HELP
BORDER PATROL.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I REJECT AMNESTY.
I DON'T FEEL THAT'S THE WAY TO
DO IT.
I FEEL A MORAL OBLIGATION.
THAT'S THE PERSON I WANT IN THE
COUNTRY.
AMERICANS ARE TRYING TO GET A
JOB.
>> WE HAVE THESE BILLS GOING ON
IN THE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT'S
WEIGHTING IN.
HE TWEETED ABOUT IT TONIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU SEE THE POTENTIAL
FOR ANYTHING HAPPENING HERE?
>> HE WILL DO A BETTER JOB OF
COMING UP WITH A FRESH IDEA.
THESE PEOPLE HAVE FAILED IN THE
PAST.
THEY HAVE FAILED AGAIN.
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET
ANYBODY TO WORK TOGETHER.
THEY ARE NOT SEVERING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WHY NOT EMPLOY THE PEOPLE HERE
AND MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT
THEMSELVES.
I'M ALL FOR GIVING SOMEONE A
HELPING HAND.
WHY NOT DO SOMETHING TO GET THEM
ENGAGED IN THE WORK FORCE.
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE MORE
JOBS THEN PEOPLE TO FILL THEM.
WE HAVE TO GET THE LAY BAR LABOR
PARTICIPATION UP.
THE ANSWER IS NOT AMNESTY.
WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO
STAY WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW TO
BEGIN WITH.
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE
WALL AND SECURE THE BORDERS AND
EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE THEIR
TURN.
I'M FLUSTERED WITH PEOPLE
BLAMING THE PRESIDENT AND
TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN BEING
SEPARATED.
DON'T BREAK THE LAW AND BLAME US
WHEN YOU HAVE TOTAL DISREGARD
FOR THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS.
WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS.
WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME IN.
FOLLOW THE RULES AND WAIT YOUR
TURN IN LINE.
WE ARE GOING TO EMPLOY THE
PEOPLE ARE HERE LAWFULLY AND THE
CITIZENS THAT SHOULD BE WORKING
AND MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT
THEMSELVES.
>> JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT,
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE
CHILD SEPARATION THING.
THE HUMANE ALTERNATIVE IS BUILD
THE WALL THEN YOU WON'T HAVE ANY
ONE COMING IN.
>> THE MOST QUOTED FEDERAL JUDGE
IN MY BOOK HE'S HARDLY A
CONSERVATIVE.
20 YEARS AGO HE WROTE AN OPINION
THAT INVOLVED ANCHOR BABIES THAT
SAY WE HAVE TO STOP THIS.
IT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE
WALL.
AS LONG AS PEOPLE CAN COME HERE
AND DROP A BABY --
STEVE: THAT'S A TERM A LOT OF
PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.
>> IT'S WHATEVER WAY WE
COMMUNICATE IMMIGRATION.
DON'T LET THEM KNOW ANY FACTS.
THERE IS NOTHING RACIAL OR
SEXUAL.
YOU ANCHOR THE CHILD HERE AND
THEY CAN BRING IN ALL OF THE
RELATIVES.
IT'S A METAPHOR.
THEY ARE UPSET ABOUT IT BECAUSE
IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DISCUSSION
IMMIGRATION.
>> AND CHAIN MIGRATION.
>> BACK THEN POSENER SAID AS
LONG AS YOU INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE
COMING HERE THEY WILL KEEP DYING
AND CROSSING THROUGH THE DESERT
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THE MAGNET
ON.
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT.
I'LL SAY ONE OTHER THING.
THESE CHILD ACTORS WEEPING AND
CRYING ON ALL OF THE OTHER
NETWORKS 24/7.
DON'T FALL FOR IT MR.
PRESIDENT.
I GET NERVOUS WHEN HE GETS NEWS
FROM TV.
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
>> A NEW YORKER IS NOT A
CONSERVATIVE PUBLICATION
STEVE: I TOLD YOU WE WOULDN'T
GET A WORLD IN.
I'M SORRY WE HAVE TO GO.
>> THEY ARE GETTING SCRIPTS TO
