1
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:09,911
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:12,947
A LOT OF LAVA CREATING A NEW

3
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,949
THREAT IN HAWAII AFTER REACHING

4
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,351
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,387
APPARENTLY IT SENDS UP TOXIC

6
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:22,123
FUMES AND GLASS-LIKE PARTICLES

7
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:25,193
IN THE AIR.

8
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:27,161
PHYSICISTS MICHAEL JOINS US.

9
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,464
FOR THOSE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA,

10
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,999
I KNOW OFFICIALLY, YOU KNOW, THE

11
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,668
HAWAIIAN AGENCIES AND THE LIKE

12
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:34,869
SAID THERE'S NO PROBLEM HERE.

13
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,104
YOU CAN FLY HERE.

14
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:38,606
NO CONCERN ABOUT LANDING AT ANY

15
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:41,242
OF THE OTHER ISLANDS, EVEN THE

16
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,076
BIG ISLAND.

17
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:45,112
FOR RESIDENTS IN THE IMMEDIATE

18
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,214
LOCAL, WHAT IS IT LIKE?

19
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,483
>> THE HEADLINE FOR THEM RIGHT

20
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,618
NOW, NEIL, KILAUEA IS A TRIPLE

21
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:50,952
THREAT.

22
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:52,787
2 1/2 WEEKS AGO, IT STARTED

23
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:56,324
OOZING VERY THICK, SLOW-MOVING

24
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,826
LAVA OUT OF CRACKS THAT SURROUND

25
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:02,063
KILAUEA, ESPECIALLY TO THE EAST

26
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:06,501
AND SLIGHTLY NORTH.

27
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:10,505
AFTER THAT IT STARTED SPEWING

28
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,139
SULFUR DIOXIDE, A POISONOUS GAS.

29
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,408
OVER THE WEEKEND, LAVA HAS MOVED

30
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,676
INTO THE OCEAN.

31
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,479
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU HAVE FIRE

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,349
BASICALLY MEETING WATER AND THE

33
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,684
HYDROGEN CHLORIDE IN THE MAGMA

34
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,821
WHEN IT MEETS THE SEA WATER

35
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,589
CREATES HYDROCHLORIC ACID THAT

36
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,024
IS GOING IN THE AREA.

37
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,059
THESE POOR PEOPLE HAVE IT COMING

38
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,327
AT THEM IN THREE DIFFERENT

39
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,597
FRONTS AND THEY HAVE TO BE VERY

40
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,398
CAREFUL.

41
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,202
>> Neil: HOW WIDE IS THE DANGER

42
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:46,607
>> YOU KNOW, THE PLUME OF

43
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,908
HYDROCHLORIC ACID IS MORE THAN A

44
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:48,209
MILE.

45
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,011
FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN COVERING

46
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,747
VOLCANOS, IT'S THE IMMEDIATE

47
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:55,216
SOUTHEAST PART OF HAWAII.

48
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,184
I COVERED ANOTHER ONE IN 1991.

49
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:03,324
THAT WAS A MUCH MORE EXPLOSIVE

50
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:06,060
VOLCANO.

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,430
KILAUEA IS A SHIELDED LAVA THAT

52
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,033
OOZES LAVA.

53
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:13,400
EXPLOSIVE.

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,071
IN 1991, THE STUFF GOT SO HIGH

55
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,807
IN THE AIR GOT IN THE

56
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,575
STRATOSPHERE AND COOLED DOWN THE

57
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:21,876
EARTH.

58
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,978
I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING NOW.

59
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,780
THE EFFECTS OF KILAUEA WILL BE

60
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,517
CONFINED TO THAT REGION OF

61
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:30,851
HAWAII.

62
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,888
SO THOSE PEOPLE THERE IN THE

63
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,423
GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANT, THEY

64
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,260
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND VIGILANT.

65
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,329
THE SCIENTISTS HAVE TOLD PEOPLE

66
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,632
JUST -- YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S

67
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,599
GOING TO GO.

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,369
WE HAVE TO SEE, WE'RE BETTER AT

69
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:52,706
PREDICTING VOLCANOS THAN OTHER

70
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,910
NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE

71
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,310
EARTHQUAKES.

72
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,679
THAT'S A PLUS.

73
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,382
>> Neil: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STATE.

74
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,983
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF VISITORS?

75
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,185
>> I'D STAY AWAY FROM THE

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,187
SOUTHEAST REGION OF HAWAII.

77
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,123
I'VE BEEN ON THE ISLAND MANY

78
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:09,423
TIMES.

79
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,759
YOU CAN FLY IN TO THE OTHER

80
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,059
PARTS.

81
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:14,395
THE OTHER THREE QUADRANTS.

82
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,297
>> Neil: SO THEY'RE NOT

83
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,464
AFFECTED.

84
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,666
>> PERFECTLY SAFE.

85
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,400
NOT REALLY.

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,870
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT STAYING

87
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,606
UNDERSTOOD WIND OF THE

88
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,875
HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND IS SULFUR

89
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,092
DIOXIDE

90
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:28,742
DIOXID

91
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,076
DIOXIDE.

92
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:29,676
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IDEA.

93
00:03:29,676 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Neil: INDEED IT IS.
