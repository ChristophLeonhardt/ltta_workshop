even after a cholera outbreak earlier this year the sewage problem contaminating Vancouver waterways is getting worse seems odd right since the hippy trippy mayor and the NDP government are blocking a pipeline expansion from Alberta that has never leaked into the ocean in the name of the coastlines Vancouver's Falls Creek is a popular recreation spot in fact the City of Vancouver used the area to host the Concorde Pacific Dragon Boat Festival that drew boat teams and visitors from all around the world but during the festival there was one unspoken rule no playful paddle splashing because you know you might get cholera dysentery norovirus or hepatitis A and that's if you're lucky and that's because the water in False Creek is contaminated with raw human sewage and it's been that way for decades the water at Falls Creek is contaminated for a couple of different reasons now according to the city of Vancouver recreational boaters dump their sewage holds into the waters there but there's one much bigger more disgusting reason and that is that the province of Vancouver allows untreated sewage to be pumped directly into the ocean and because Falls Creek is really a dead end the ocean currents can't flush away the thousands of toilets that flush into False Creek every single day right now Falls Creek contains four times the levels of pollution deemed safe for swimming it's an e coli petri dish that often smells like sewage it's no secret it's never being a secret how could it be a secret it literally stinks like an outhouse there some days now the city of Vancouver under the leadership of left-wing environmentalist Mayor Gregor Robertson has been promising and promising for years to clean up Falls Creek and nothing really has been done in fact in data obtained by the Toronto Star in this unusually good article for them despite the mayor of Vancouver being a raging tree-hugging hippie and the NDP government of VC being populated by radical environmentalist wackadoodles the amount of untreated poop soup pouring into BC waterways has reached a five-year high B seesaw a small-scale cholera yes you heard that right cholera outbreak on Vancouver Island earlier this year after people ate herring eggs that had been contaminated with raw sewage from one of those untreated sewage outflows one would think the re-emergence of third-world sanitation related diseases might have prompted some government focus on the issue of sewage flowing into the ocean but alas the issue of BC using the ocean as a septic tank was lost in the shuffle by a government focused on blocking the expansion of a pipeline from Alberta that has never ever leaked into the ocean after 70 years in operation but that's because modern environmentalism isn't really about nature or conservation it's about blocking fossil fuels and the rest is just a competition to out virtue signal everyone else like the most recent war on plastic straws from which to drink your overpriced diabetes inducing coffee concoction in your plastic cup with a plastic lid from a garbage intensive Starbucks and about that Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson he's decided not to run again this year leaving the sewage outflow problem of false creek and other areas for someone else to clean up but that's because keeping mother nature green and clean was never really Gregor Robertson's concern according to analysis and investigation done by Vivian Krauss mayor Robertson took over half a million dollars in support over six years from the foreign-funded environmentalist organization types Canada and others and we know the tides foundation the parent organization of tights Canada has been involved in an elaborate campaign finance and coordinated by the Rockefeller Brothers fund that blocks Canadian energy exports to Asia and it wants to choke off investment in the Alberta oil sands in 2010 mayor Robertson and his chief of staff Mike McGee visited the Rockefeller Brothers offices in New York and met specifically with the Rockefellers coordinator of this oil sands campaign Michael Northrup so yeah while baby whales navigate a stew of human fecal matter from Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson can retire successfully because he did do the job that he was quote-unquote hired by tides Canada to do that trans mountain pipeline isn't going to get built any time soon but neither are the sewage pipelines and that's what happens when you're mayor works for foreign-funded anti Canadian organizations and not the people of Vancouver for the rebel media I'm Shiela gonna read what you just saw there is my daily video that I do here at the rebel but I also do my own weekly full-length show it's aptly called the gun show course let me talk about issues facing Canadian families but to get access to my show and the rest of our incredible premium content you've got to treat yourself to a rebel subscription today
