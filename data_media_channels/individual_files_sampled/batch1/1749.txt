these Muscovites are learning how to be disruptors they volunteered to monitor voting in Russia's presidential election and meetings like this have been happening all over the country they're shown videos of what to look out for this one is from parliamentary elections two years ago and shows what looks like ballot stuffing in southern Russia they want to minimize such fraud being repeated which they hope will keep Sunday's election turnout from being artificially inflated simply community needs everyone understands that this is not an election and there's no point in voting that's why our only game is the turnout because that's the Kremlin's main focus in this election and they fight for high turnout with all their administrative resources the man driving all this is Alexei Navalny Russia's most high-profile opposition politician in December he was barred from the elections for an embezzlement conviction that he's always said was politically motivated choosing the president's choosing the future says the sign and it's an intriguing idea isn't it what if Russians had been able to make that choice between Vladimir Putin and Alexei Navalny well polling over the last year suggests that Vladimir Putin is consistently on 70% whereas no Volney is in low single digits the implication of that is clear but it's telling of the Kremlin's approach to things that they weren't prepared to even take that chance so no Valdis plan B is to delegitimize Vladimir Putin's expected re-election his tactics our polling station monitoring and calling for an election boycott he's sure of the result but he needs people to come to the polling stations otherwise his spectacle the actors the lighting man and the cloakroom attendant are all in place but the theater is empty the audience didn't turn up and that's what scares him for many of Navalny supporters this is a generational struggle when I went to my first rally a year ago my granny called me and said you study in a state-funded University and the state pays for your education why are you going to rally you're being so bad but youngsters in the university especially in Moscow support Navalny because everyone sees where the country is going the Central Election Committee has already attempted to block accreditation for thousands of neva Lee's monitors campaign activists around the country face prosecutions and jail sentences like with all new valnes initiatives this one won't go smoothly Rory challon's al Jazeera Moscow
