00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,691
HE SAID HE WOULD DRAIN THE SWAMP

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,225
IN WASHINGTON DC.

6
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,326
WHEN WE TAKE ON AN INDUSTRY OR

7
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,294

ALL WE DO IT BECAUSE WE REALLY

11
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:43,109
WANT TO SEE THE SYSTEM CHANGE.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,243
WHEN WE DO SEE CHANGE AS A

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,344
RESULT OF OUR CAMPAIGNING WE

14
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,292

00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,241
GOVERNMENT BUT THE AMERICAN

17
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,275
PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT

18
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,344
WHEN BUSINESS LEADERS SERVING

19
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,713
GOVERNMENT REPRESENT THE

20
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:21,347
INTEREST OF ALL AMERICAN

21
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,148

22
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,315
AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE TRUMP

23
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,552

ROSS WHO, IS IT TURNS OUT, IS NO

26
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:32,992
STRANGER TO THE STEEL INDUSTRY.

27
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:33,692
HE'S NEGOTIATING OVER SOUTH

28
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,460
KOREAN STEEL IMPORTS WHILE

29
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,327
MAKING MONEY FROM IMPORTING

30
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,797
SOUTH KOREAN STEEL.

31
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:42,935

00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,514
TERRORISTS ON THE KOREAN STEEL.

35

THEY ALSO ARGUE THE POTENTIAL

36
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,283
SANCTIONS UNDER THIS BLOOD DON'T

37
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,119
AFFECT THE COMPANY THAT SHIPS

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,990
THE STUPID THINGS HAVE GOTTEN

39
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:09,829
WORSE FOR THE SECRETARY BUT IT'S

41
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,264

HE NOW DONE THE RIGHT THING AT

48
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,447

49
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,448
REPORT WE REACH OUT TO SECRETARY

50
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,349
ROSS INVITING HIM TO COME AND

00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:32,985
STATEMENT AFTER THE SHOW AIRED

52
00:02:32,986 --> 00:03:01,380
INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.

53
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,281
RUBBER CLOTH DEFENSE WAS TO

54
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:09,121
CLAIM HE WAS NOT VIOLATING ANY

55
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:09,855
ETHICS PUBLISHED WAS BECAUSE

56
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,589
TRADE NEGOTIATIONS DON'T AFFECT

57
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,357
THE COMPANIES HE PARTIALLY OWNS

58
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,359
BUT HOW COULD NEGOTIATIONS ON

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,993
TERRORISTS FOR SOUTH KOREA

60
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,795
FAILED TO AFFECT THE SHIPPING

61
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,332
COMPANIES THAT STEAL FROM AND

62
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,801
HOW COULD NEGOTIATIONS WITH

63
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,435
TENANT NOT AFFECT ANOTHER

64
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,169
SHIPPING COMPANY THAT CONDUCTED

65
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,706
BUSINESS WITH THE CHINESE STATE

66
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,407
OWNED COMPANY, PETRO CHINA.

67
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,911
WORSE THAN THAT CLAIM IN HIS

68
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,535
ACCORDANCE AGREEMENT SIMPLY WAS

69
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,269
NOT TRUE A FEW WEEKS LATER

70
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,105

CALLED INVESTIGATIVE.

73
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,241
LAST WEEK THE VALUES OF THOSE

74
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,242
ASSETS GROUP EARNING HIS NET

75
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,243
TWO-$62 MILLION BUT THE DAY HE

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,678
PROMISED TO SELL THEM IN THE DAY

77
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,645
HE ACTUALLY SAID THEM SECRETARY

78
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,413
ROSS ADMITTED MISTAKE THE

79
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,647
CLAIMED HE WILL NOT SELL STOCKS

80
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:12,685
TO US HIDING BEHIND THE OFFICE

81
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,452
OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS CAME BACK

82
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,720
TO BITE HIM BECAUSE WHEN THEY

83
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,822

84
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:51,256
IT --

85
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:51,924
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ACTION.

86
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:52,758
YES, THAT WOULD BE US.

87
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,394
IN RESPONSE TO THE ETHICS OF

88
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,110

00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,111

00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:53,118
INCLUDE HIS INTEREST IN NAUTICAL

91
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:53,852
BUILDINGS, SHIPPING AND THE

TRANSPORTATION RECOVERY FUND,

93
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,991
ALL BUT REPORTED AS CONFLICT OF

94
00:05:58,992 --> 00:05:59,792

00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:05,931
INTERESTS.

98
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,598
THAT IS GREAT NEWS.

99
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,833
AS I SAID, WILBUR ROSS HAS DONE

100
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,333
THE RIGHT THING.

101
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:12,204
YOU SHOULD NOW GET CREDIT FOR

102
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:18,710
THAT.

103
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,711
THE STORY WAS NEVER JUST ABOUT

104
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,879
WILBUR ROSS IT WAS ABOUT THIS

105
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,613
THING PRESIDENT TRUMPS DURING

106
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,114
THE SWAMP AGENDA.

107
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:22,848
IT'S THE BIGGEST MOST PROMISES

108
00:06:22,849 --> 00:00:00,000
HE MADE THE 16.
