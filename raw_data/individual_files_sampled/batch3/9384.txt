EIGHT, MAYBE TEN INCHES OF RAIN WHEREVER THE STORM MAKES LANDFALL. JUST TO THE EAST OF THAT IS GOING TO BE THE WORST OF IT. IT IS FLEET WEEK HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AND TODAY WE'RE CELEBRATING WITH THE NAVY, MARINE AND COAST GUARD PULGT THEM TO THE TEST WITH THE BONE FROG CHALLENGE JOINING US NOW, JOSH RICH, RACE DIRECTOR. WE'RE OFTENTIMES HAPPY WHEN YOU GUYS ARE HERE. NOT ALL OF THE TIME. TODAY WE'VE GOT A RAINY DAY. TELL US ABOUT THE EVENT THAT YOU GUYS PUT ON. BONE FROG IS THE ONLY NAVY S.E.A.L. OBSTACLE RACE. NEXT RACE IS IN NEW JERSEY. RACE IS FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE OUT THERE, 3-MILE, 6-MILE AND A 9-MILE RACE AND A KIDS' COURSE. WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES? WE'VE HAD A LOT OF MILITARY ASPECTS. MEMORIAL WALLS AND OBSTACLES THAT HONOR FALLEN COME THAT HONOR FALLEN COMRADES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. ON THE BIGGER COURSES YOU'LL SEE THAT STUFF TIED INTO IT. HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE IF SOMEBODY IS THINKING HEY I WANT TO DO THIS BUT I'M NOT IN THE BEST OF SHAPE AS A NAVY S.E.A.L. IS THIS SOMETHING ANYBODY CAN DO? ABSOLUTELY. THAT HE'S WHY WE HAVE THE DIFFERENT DISTANCES. THE 3-MILE TAKES AN HOUR, 6-MILE IS TWO AND THE 9-MILE IS TWO AND A HALF TO THREE HOURS DEPENDING. IS THIS A TEAM ELEMENT TO THIS OR EVERYBODY ON YOUR OWN. YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY FOR TEAM. MOST PEOPLE THAT RUN THE COURSE RUN AS A GROUP, THEY HELP EACH OTHER THROUGH IT. EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. LAST YEAR WHEN YOU WERE HERE, YOU SAID DON'T WORRY, WE HAVE 70-YEAR-OLDS WHO DO THIS. I TOOK GREAT OFFENSE TO THIS. WHAT'S THE OLDEST PERSON YOU'VE HAD DO THIS RACE? 77. A LADY RAN IT AT 77 YEARS OLD. DID PHENOMENAL. IT'S GETTING OUT THERE, GETTING OVER YOUR OWN HURDLES AND HAVING FUN WITH IT. WE'RE GOING TO GET OVER THE HURDLES IN THE RAIN TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE NEXT EVENT IS JUNE 16th IN
