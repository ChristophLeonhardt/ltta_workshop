Borat strikes again but this guy was not buying it that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel I reported on a story earlier in the week about Sasha Baron Cohen basically mocking people conservatives mainly disabled veterans among them and truthfully I placed all of the blame squarely on the shoulders of Sasha Baron Cohen I called him out for being disgraceful classless and disgusting but to his credit I feel like everyone among their PR team should have someone vetting people maybe you don't necessarily need a specific person dedicated to it but you definitely should have someone on your team capable of identifying whether someone is Borat or not like Sasha Baron Cohen identifier or something Sarah Palin did not have that Dick Cheney did not have that and numerous other pro-gun conservatives did not have that however a gun owner in Riverside California recognized Sacha Baron Cohen right off the bat he didn't even need a PR screener so congrats her so Norris Wyden owns a gun shop called warrior 1 Guns & Ammo love that name SBC Sacha Baron Cohen comes in with his film crew claiming that he's a Hungarian immigrant so Sweden's account of the situation is as follows and if I throw in a bit of twing it's because I'm from Alabama and this guy talks like about 20 of my friends so forgive me he says this he comes in off the bat you can see in the video I'm looking like this guy does not look like a Hungarian immigrant tight-ass leather pants a beard it just didn't fit the moment his words came out of his mouth I was like this guy's full of shit I'm looking at the producer and I'm just like am I being full deep right here and I just kept looking at the guy and I was like you're Borat as soon as I said that his eyes just looked at me and he did a turn right out of the door swear I can hear this entire paragraph in my dad's voice it sounds just like him it also helps that my dad has enough guns that he could outfit a gun store or 20 so yes Borat bolted and fled the scene his obstinate crew stuck around until Sweden said get the eff out you guys are full of shit have a great day get out so moral of the story here stick to your guns folks you know what you believe you know what seems shady if some weird-looking partially racially ambiguous but partially middle-eastern looking wacko steps up to you asking you to endorse fourth grader bolstering weapons in PE don't do it okay okay have a great day everybody thanks for watching I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com
