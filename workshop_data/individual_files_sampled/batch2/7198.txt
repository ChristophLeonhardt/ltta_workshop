we had hurricane Harvey it was devastating over 60 people killed tens of thousands displaced and then the meteorologist told us hurricane Irma had turned into a category five and that Lanning Ocean the largest storm ever recorded an Atlantic Basin and nonetheless after those forecasts rush limbaugh went on air and basically said that it was all hype and that it wasn't real and he said this the reason that I am leery of forecasts this far out folks is because I see how the system works the one thing that's undeniable throughout our culture is that everything has been politicized and in that sense much of our public information system including from the government from the drive-by media has been corrupted so basically telling folks you don't have to worry about the storm it's all politicized ironically as he politicizes it and that it's corrupted information well this is not fake news this is unfortunately deadly real hurricane Irma's death toll already as it rips through the Caribbean is 13 dead its intensity is unreal it's a category 5 hurricane in order to get to a category 5 you have to have 157 miles per hour it is tough has a top wind speed of a hundred and eighty five miles per hour like I said the most severe storm ever seen in the Atlantic and you know during hurricane and Harvey I played clips for you explaining how the warmer temperatures picks up more moisture it creates more severe storms this is not me saying it's not Al Gore saying it's almost every scientists in the world explain exactly how that phenomenon works well before these storms that had happened to Houston and hurricane Harvey and now it is happening to the Caribbean utter destruction in its path hurricane Irma is coming not only that we now have two other storms that I'm going to tell you about as well Katya and Jose have also formed there are a number of storms here let me show you its path here as you see some of the destruction in the Caribbean it doesn't look like a war zone war zones I'm not sure look that bad so it is going to rip through the Korean Caribbean and then go most likely path and of course these storms through diverts from time to time is through Florida and some of the other southern states I'm going to tell you about the reaction there as well but now let me show you the three storms that are coming it's not just our Maremma is the largest but as you look at this satellite image from the CNN Weather Center you've got a gigantic storm in the middle there you've got Katya that is now a hurricane on the Gulf Coast and you've got Jose which is now a hurricane was a trouble this tropical storm but now a hurricane as they get more and more severe following right nervous footsteps this is an unbelievable punch after punch after punch it was Harvey now three more all at the same time CNN explains further Irma is one of the three active hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin the last time this happened was in 2010 the others are Jose in the open Atlantic far to the south east of Irma and Katya on the Gulf of Mexico you know sometimes you'll hear insane right we talking points about how oh no we haven't had a hurricane in 12 years so the climate scientists weren't right no no there's hurricanes all over it's the question is do they hit the United States of America but in their limited limited vision they're so short-sighted so self-centered if it doesn't hit America it doesn't really count and and climate change isn't real does it look fake to you right now yes these are real pictures real videos this is actually what's happening with hurricane Irma it is unreal so it's amazing and and and yes in this case unfortunately looks like it's gonna hit us as well were Toriko they say when a million people might lose their electricity and power and not get it back for a month okay around 2:00 p.m. Eastern Irma was moving west-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 175 miles per hour herma previously it winds over 180 miles per hour keeping those speeds longer than any storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin now we believe that it is going to hit the United States eventually we're not the only ones who believe that it is actually Republican governors and all the governors in the south who believe that Florida is not the only state preparing for possible impact Georgia's governor besides ordering coastal evacuations from Saturday declared a state of emergency for 30 counties North Carolina's governor Roy Cooper the South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster also declared states of emergency Cooper's a Democrat but the rest of them are Republicans so and by the way Rick Scott in in Florida who declared a state of emergency has banned his officials inside the state from using the words climate change whether you ban the words or not it's still a reality so you can't get rid of the concept by just by banning the words and by the way what is that that is the literal definition of political correctness climate change might be scientifically correct but in the state of Florida it is not politically correct so you're not allowed to utter the words if you work for the state but you've got to prepare because whether you say the magic words or not it's coming and they know it that's why they've declared a state of emergency in all those states despite what their right-wing propagandists say now if you think it's bad for us it's much worse for some of the kind of countries in the Caribbean let's go to the Bahamas the Prime Minister of the Bahamas says this is the largest such evacuation in the history of our country some of the islands of the Bahamas aren't more than nine feet above sea level storm surges they're maybe 20 feet you get the idea what's going to happen to those islands that's now a Chad Myers as CNN meteorologists who said that if they're only 9 feet above sea level then the sea surge is 20 feet doesn't take a meteorologist to do that math and this is going to be terrible and Barbuda is already hit and in utter destruction CNN reports the island is quote barely habitable with nearly all its buildings damaged to give you more context about 95 percent of the buildings and Barbuda one of two major islands the nation of Antigua and Barbuda are damaged FRA minister Gaston Brown said 95 percent of the buildings Hermes I passed directly over Barbuda on Wednesday leaving the small islands eighteen hundred residents largely in Kamiya incommunicado for hours because it knocked over the telecommunication system and cell towers now some of the people who told you about climate change which are all scientists told you that some islands might literally be underwater might disappear from the earth so hopefully the people of Barbuda recover but right now their island is absolutely debits devastated almost every building is damaged every citizen affected and for a while there they were cut off from the rest of the world this is what climate change looks like so let me show you the path one more time for the storm here and the reason it gets wider is because the further you go out the the more of a range it has a can go left it can go right so it might hit Miami directly it my graze Miami but hit the southern states harder depending on its path and it has already hit some of those islands and it is affecting Puerto Rico let me show you more pictures so this mother of nature ain't none to mess with if it comes for you there's nothing you could do about it so winds this strong the sea rising up what are you gonna do you're gonna move all the cars you're gonna move all the crates you're gonna move all the boats you're gonna move all the buildings how are you gonna do that you can't so this is what happens and again we're only at the beginning of this storm we're not at the middle of it we're not at the end of it it hasn't even hit the US yet at least the mainland and as you can see complete and utter destruction in some of the places that it has had this is really scary stuff dangerous stuff and guys if you hear any idiot on the right or anywhere or else telling you that it's not real and that you shouldn't move for God's sake don't listen them listen to the authorities listen to the meteorologists and the scientists if they say it's headed in your direction get out save yourself save your family and like I said even the Republican governor of Florida now saying look don't worry about your house we can rebuild your house we can't rebuild your family you got to go so listen to exactly what your local authorities are telling you to do and follow up but I will end on this note one part of the path of the storm goes through here alert we should pull this up now it goes potentially right through Palm Beach where there are two interesting places mar-a-lago and Rush Limbaugh's house so let's see if he's true to his word and doesn't really believe it and stays right there right on the ocean since I am at progressive and actually care about other human beings rush don't be an idiot leave but we'll see if he follows through her a dozen and if he runs in a panic you'll have your answer as to whether he thinks it's fake or not and if you stay so we have a completely different answer science is real it doesn't care about your emotions and it doesn't care about your propaganda whether you're denied or not one day it comes a-knockin and that's today if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network comm sighs join
