them and we are playing the new WWE game
I do this I'd make a video on this like
every single year so um I don't know
what we should do would you play a
one-on-one okay
actually I just thought of something
there is this new character in this game
but first what game Oh should we play
iron man's submission what do any of
these things mean let's do a ladder
match okay so if we go on to downloaded
superstars Arnold Schwarzenegger sit in
the game look the bloody Terminator jaw
is determine HR I'm going to do get to
the choppa okay I'm gonna play as The
Terminator
okay we are going to play at
WrestleMania and we are going to play
through the wall every way championship
okay here we go baby

going to be no job and I mean the World
Heavyweight Champion I am a robot
oh my god the crowd they're gonna crowd
this so excited yeah go terminator I'm a
good look like kids alright so the
premise of a ladder match ladies and
gentlemen is that there is ladders all
around the ring okay and the
championship belt is on the top of the
ring and we need to use the ladder to go
up it and grab the championship belt
okay now I don't know how to play this
game so um I don't even know how to
climb a ladder with the question is
ladies gentlemen what is my opponent
gonna be oh look at these commentators
oh shit who's my Oh Oh what my clothes

that way I recognize that noise hustle
loyalty respect Jesus Christ I can't be

the middle of his entrance so up is the
best this is the best dubby dubby game

dog hello doggy woof woof
this is what I've always wanted
the Terminator what does that was that
impression it's a really bad one okay
for our next game we're gonna do a
triple threat match and I'm thinking we
will do a Hell in a Cell match okay I'm
gonna play as the other Arnold
Schwarzenegger I don't know why there's
two okay but I kind of want to see his
entrance move okay here we go
is this just the other terminators entry
oh shit up there against the rock now
the rock has the best music don't you
think
all right so it's the rock but who is
our opponents no what was that
Oh terminator really what's the winners
is on the boat he's already got one he
wants a bloody another one okay so I
think if entereth move is the same Jesus
Christ can you bloody hurry up okay
Mario he's determined
oh shit if I was the rock right now I
would be shitting it hurry up Arnold
Jesus how long does it take me to get
from that a to be Jesus Christ that
announces alike aren't Lord to saver up
I get my clothes with off oh shit we're
playing against Randy Orton as well okay
I've got time for your shit Randy the
cage has been lowered oh shit look at
this the rock he's like oh I don't give
a shit about this game I've already got
one belt okay so how in a Cell match is
just basically just you get to do
anything but uh steel cage match is a
one where you have to escape so this one
is it's all about like just winning
really okay the plan is to just let
these two just be the shit out of each
other look I don't know they're doing
thing I'm just gonna talk Oh from hell
come on referee look at him he knows
he's gonna get beaten up
get him oh shit
