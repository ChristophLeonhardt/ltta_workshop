8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,890

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,680
hilarious that I thought I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do like</font>

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,469

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,920
still counts and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty proud of</font>

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,590
myself because like with my other

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,780
parallel accomplishment of running my

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,230
race last weekend I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,590
at practicing the art of not quitting

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,480
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving up so this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,030
really fun and a great way to get back

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,920
into making videos and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited and</font>

my stuff we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> all talk about it and it</font>

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,310
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool I think the most</font>

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,930
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I will take from</font>

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,390
this year and carry over when I try this

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,420
again next year is planning ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made</font>

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,280
this list of different topics i could

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,810
use before the month started just in

31
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,080
case I ever ran out of ideas and that

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,900
list was like exhausted by maybe a third

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,329
to half of a month through so next year

34
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,040
I plan even more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might make a</font>

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,140
format for certain days like I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,490
silence sunday maybe I'll

37
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,259
that every time next year if I do this

38
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,530
again I will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot better at</font>

39
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,030
watching and commenting and interacting

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,970
with other people's videos because I

41
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,020
didn't feel like I had time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,909
much this year but it makes the

43
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,890
experience so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much better to have that</font>

44
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,570
connection for people who are in the

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,119
same boat<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also want to know like how</font>

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,560

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,710
don't know i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i learned how to say</font>

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,780
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing bone serious topics</font>

50
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,149
and also how to not take myself so

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,519
seriously overall I think I've grown a

52
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:14,100
lot as a content creator come up with

53
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,600
more ideas I've gained a lot more

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,030
confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also just more technical</font>

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,580
skills and you know creativity is like a

56
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,980
muscle the more you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it the stronger</font>

57
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,100
it gets so what's next<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me i think i</font>

58
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,980
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a breather for a</font>

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,950
week or two and come back maybe around

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,430

67
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,680
