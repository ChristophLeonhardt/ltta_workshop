00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,040
This tractor is spreading corn
and birdseed as part of a

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,850
government-funded program.

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,900
It will feed tens of thousands
of cranes that would otherwise

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,500
destroy nearby crop fields
important for farmers.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,980
The cranes are just a fraction
of the half billion birds that

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,810
stop off here, in the marshes and
swamps of the Hula Valley in Israel.

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,710
Twice a year, they fly thousands of
miles between Europe and Africa,

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,089
along the way threatened by
hunters in the Mediterranean.

9
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:46,009
This nature reserve is their
safe zone to rest and refuel.

10
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,309
And birders from around the world
gather each year to observe them

11
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:00,000
in the park and at festivals.
