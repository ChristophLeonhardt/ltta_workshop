ON HERE?

25
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:47,550
THIS LOOKS LIKE A SHOULDER

26
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,053
BRACE, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

27
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:51,087
>> I JUST HAD A SHOULDER

28
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:52,455
REPLACEMENT TWO WEEKS AGO.

29
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:54,124
GUARANTIED TO GET RID OF MY

30
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:54,891
SLICE.

31
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,259
NEIL: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

32
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,360
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN ANOTHER

33
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,795
FIGHT WITH POLITICIANS.

34
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,531
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT THAT.

35
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,466
>> IT'S THE WEIGHT OF THE

36
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:04,034
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

37
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,135
NEIL: IT'S INTERESTING THAT ALL

38
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:06,803
THE CANDIDATES WHO WERE RUNNING,

39
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:08,939
ALL THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES

40
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,908
SHARED DEAL FOR CUTTING TAXES,

41
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:12,742
SHRINKING GOVERNMENT, DOING

42
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:13,877
SOMETHING ABOUT REFORMING

43
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:16,146
WELFARE, SO THEY WERE ALL

44
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:19,983
CLEARLY PREACHING FROM YOUR

45
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:22,719
CHOIR BOOK, IS THAT A NATIONAL

46
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,354
APPEALING TREND, WHAT WORKS IN

47
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:26,489
MAINE SO FAR, SO FAR NOMINEES

48
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:29,793
IT'S GOING TO WORK NATIONALLY?

49
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:30,694
>> I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE SO.

50
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,028
I THINK THE PEOPLE -- WHAT THE

51
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:34,297
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS

52
00:01:34,297 --> 00:01:36,633
SOMEONE THAT IS NOT A CAREER

53
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,301
POLITICIAN BUT SOMEONE THAT'S

54
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:39,936
GOING TO COME IN AND DO THE JOB

55
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:41,604
AND LEAVE AND LET SOMEBODY ELSE

56
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:42,872
COME IN AND   DO IT.

57
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,175
IN OUR CASE SEAN MOODY IS A

58
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,042
BASEMAN.

59
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:49,612
HE'S A MAINER, SELF-MADE, AND

60
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:51,748
HE'S WELL LIKED AND WELL

61
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:53,416
RESPECTED AND WHAT HE SAYS IS

62
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,951
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO AND THAT'S

63
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:57,854
WHAT CAPTURED THE EYE AND THE

64
00:01:57,854 --> 00:01:59,823
HEARTS TO HAVE MAINORS.

65
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:01,791
NEIL: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

66
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,660
>> I HAVE NO IDEA YET.

67
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,728
STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS.

68
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:06,396
MY WIFE AND I ARE GOING TO TAKE

69
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:08,031
THE WINTER OFF AND THEN WE WILL

70
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,332
DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

71
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:11,735
NEIL: NOW, YOUR CLOSE TO THE

72
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:12,769
PRESIDENT, HE THINKS A GREAT

73
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,972
DEAL OF YOU, HAVE YOU

74
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,140
ENTERTAINED, HAS HE TALKED ABOUT

75
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,341
A ROLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION?

76
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:21,845
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME

77
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:25,515
OPTIONS, HE'S MADE SOME

78
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:28,051
OVERTURES OF THAT I MAY BE ASKED

79
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:29,886
TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND WE ARE

80
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:31,187
LOOKING, BUT NOTHING CONCRETE AT

81
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,088
THIS POINT.

82
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:35,892
NEIL: DO THINGS IN HIS CABINET?

83
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:36,659
>> OH, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE

84
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:37,961
THE CABINET.

85
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:39,129
I JUST REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE

86
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:39,763
IN WASHINGTON.

87
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:40,930
NEIL: I SEE.

88
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,065
>> ALL OF THE TIME.

89
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,034
BUT WE WILL SEE.

90
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:44,401
[LAUGHTER]

91
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,169
NEIL: BACK TO NATIONAL ISSUES

92
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:49,406
HERE, THE PARTY SEEMS TO BE

93
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:50,907
FEELING IT'S GETTING ITS

94
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:52,509
TRACTION BACK AND THAT IT WILL

95
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,577
AVOID A SWEEP IN NOVEMBER OR AT

96
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,312
LEAST SURRENDERING THE HOUSE TO

97
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:56,746
DEMOCRATS.

98
00:02:56,746 --> 00:03:02,385
THEY BASE ON IMPROVING ECONOMY,

99
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,420
MOMENTUM MAYBE POSTNORTH KOREA,

100
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,354
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

101
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:05,655
>> I THINK THE SAME THING.

102
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:07,457
WE ARE FEELING IT IN MAINE AS

103
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,159
YOU SAW IN THE PRIMARIES, WE

104
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,827
DON'T KNOW WHO THE DEMOCRATIC

105
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,529
CANDIDATE WILL BE FOR GOVERNOR

106
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:13,730
BUT REPUBLICAN --

107
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,733
NEIL: THEY HAVE TO HAVE A RUNOFF

108
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,067
NOW?

109
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:17,801
>> THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE --

110
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,870
WHAT WE HAVE IS --

111
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,206
NEIL: THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT.

112
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,208
WHO CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA?

113
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,677
BOTH SIDES WERE CRITICIZING IT.

114
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:30,046
WHO CAME UP WITH THAT?

115
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,748
>> ACTUALLY IT'S A GROUP OUT OF

116
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:32,882
MASSACHUSETTS AND THE MONEY IS

117
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:36,019
ALL OUT OF STATE AND IT'S FUNNY,

118
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,822
BUT MAINE IS CHEAP STATE AND

119
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:42,192
THEY COME TO MAINE.

120
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:43,560
NEIL: WE WILL WATCH THAT ONE

121
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,027
CLOSELY.

122
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,728
THE IDEA IS TO AVOID CONFUSION

123
00:03:45,728 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY SEEM TO ADD TO IT.
