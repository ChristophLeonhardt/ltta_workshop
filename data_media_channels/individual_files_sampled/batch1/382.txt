hello I'm handsome seeker this is counting the cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week wild swings for global stock markets why could be a sign the borrowing costs are going up faster than expected also this week suffragettes 100 years on will look at how women in 2018 are still fighting for equal rights in the workplace plus a surge in US oil production and why that's making life more difficult for OPEC now they've been an eerie sense of calm where the markets had been concerned all of last year but this week everything changed and we saw a brutal sell-off in global stocks which accelerated as the week got underway on Monday and Tuesday stocks fell dramatically around the world erasing all of 2018 s gains in a matter of hours and then they recovered and have been pretty volatile since so what just happened well the prospect of higher interest rates across the globe was the main reason given by analysts for the market rout the world economy is just emerging from a period of record low lending rates and in some cases negative interest rates all designed to kick-start the economy nearly a decade of ultra easy monetary policy has sent asset prices sky-high now that's likely to end things like stocks bonds commodities and currencies are going to have to adjust well joining us now from London is David Madden a market analyst at CMC Markets good to have you with us David so the general consensus this week has been that the stock prices have been high maybe too high for months if not years and that a big drop was seen as somewhat likely if not inevitable is that how you see it that's exactly how I see it for too long investors were sleepwalking into the into the raging bull market that was going on underneath them and investors and traders forgot the financial markets can fall as well as rise and there was so much positive momentum there was so much positive economic indicators and there's so much enthusiasm surrounding global stock markets particularly those in the United States such as the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 investors quite frankly got complacent they ignore the fact that volatility was at look at multi-year lows and they own and they assumed that stock markets we would keep reaching fresh record highs or a lot to your highs here in Europe or in Asia and then we did hit a bit of a speed bump and we saw average earnings in the United States spike last week sending fears we could have four rate rise rises from the Federal Reserve this year that's what prompted this Exodus out of equities I don't think this is I just I just think this is a classic example of the market being over balls over stretched the salic we've seen recently was a lot of frost being taken off the top of the market and why do interest rate rises or in this case concerns over future rate rises why does that automatically mean a drop in in stock prices what what effect does that have the knock-on effect on the economy and on investor worries well the knock-on the local effects are list in the stock market it's fairly straight forward a lot of the money that's in the stock market particularly in recent books has been borrowed money so investors are borrowing basically all-time low rates rock-bottom rates to invest in the stock market which was until recently having a higher yield I looked very recently equity prices were going up also looking at what's going on in the cash market or the government bonds market higher interest rates weren't higher deposit higher yields or cash deposits and also higher yields out government bonds so investors look high highly value stocks I think why will I invest in highly value stocks which are the meat which have a reasonable yield where I can have a similar yield from US government securities or perhaps some cash accounts with quite substantially lower risk so the there's a lot of talk about equity has been overbought in the first place and there is a prospect of higher interest rates all of a sudden traders cash in their stocks and plow the money into government bonds and cash and just finally David are we now entering a new a new era where the era of easy money is pretty much over and the low interest rates that fueled that we're now we're now into a new phase of raising rising rates and an attempt to cool the economy I think we're entering the transition period whereby central bankers in the last number of years had a very aggressive loose monetary policies to kick-start the kickstart economies around the world and rinoa probably in the face where the central bank's are looking to step back and in many cases actually tighten the title monetary policy be it in the form of higher interest rates or a reduction in the stimulus package so it's almost like the economy has gotten off the ground a lot of the economy is going to have to have to survive more on its own momentum rather than the guiding hand of central bank's good to speak with you David Madden in London thank you well for every six marked 100 years since the first women were given the right to vote in the UK activists at the forefront of that campaign were known as suffragettes Barnaby Philips has their story an epic victory celebrated in the Museum of London 100 years since the first British women got the vote all thanks to the suffragettes who took on the establishment and one it wasn't easy they chained themselves to fences outside Parliament many were arrested beaten went on hunger strike one even threw herself at the Kings horse in the famous Derby race she died but the cause did not the suffragettes struggled but they ultimately won but what would they make a British society today 100 years on would they believe that women have achieved true equality it wasn't until 1928 that younger and poorer women were also given the vote and says this very in character actor the suffragettes always hoped to inspire future when we win our fight that's not gonna be the end of all the fights you know we're gonna have to keep fighting I'm sure and I just hope that we can set the precedent for that and look there you know keep fighting just as hard as we're she no doubt would agree Emmeline Pankhurst leader of the suffragettes and great-grandmother of Helen who wonders if the glass is only half-full in every single measure of political equality we still have so far to go in every single Parliament and in particular in the UK we only have 32 percent representation and if you look at all other aspects of democracy so the legal system the the media reporting of Parliament's and of politics we still have a lot to go comedy throws light on women's struggles today British institutions from Parliament to the BBC hit by revelations of gender discrimination it feels like we're just failing over and over but we have to remember the suffragettes failed for over 50 years they only succeeded once and we only need to succeed once they're impossible is our normal life and we are the hopes of the suffragettes our debt to the heroines of the past maligned in their day as misguided radicals we remember them as being on the right side of history well a century later the struggle for equal pay in workplaces across the globe continues in 2018 the World Economic Forum highlighted that women will have to wait 217 years before they earn as much as men and have equal representation in the workplace Oxfam says that the economic model is not working women consistently earn less than men and usually have lower paid and more insecure forms of work the 6.4 percent of the fortune 500 list of the biggest US corporations are run by women the world's two largest economies China and the u.s. consistently ranked poorly on the UN's annual global gender pay gap survey but there has been some progress in January Iceland became the only country in the world to make pay inequality illegal in April all UK companies with more than 250 workers will be required to submit data on pay grades and explain any gender gap well joining us now from Lancaster in England is Sylvia well be a professor of sociology and UNESCO chair in gender research at Lancaster University there thanks very much for being with us so let me ask you first off then why does the gender pay gap exists and and what are the factors that that influenced the pay gap the gender pay gap is a consequence of gender inequalities in employments and also in the wider society some research that I did looking specifically at the components of that disaggregated that gender pay gap into several parts some of it is due to direct discrimination and prejudice against women some of it is due to indirect discrimination when women are treated less well for characteristics which aren't just about being women for example working part time some issues are to do with wider gender issues in society such as issues of the domestic division of labor and whether society looks after children or whether it's only the woman's responsibility and also issues of Education where the women have equal access to education and indeed much broader issues of the extent to which there is gender balance and decision-making and whether women are full participants in the decision-making in a particular society and if women are full participants in that decision-making then you can see the fine tuning of both employment practices and policy practices which would facilitate women's greater engagement and employment and thereby close the gender pay gap in in the UK they're trying a different approach the government is talking about making companies reports their their their pay and and the their by highlighting the disparities between men and women do you do you think that that perhaps might be more effective than equal pay legislation in terms of kind of shining and unforgiving lights are on companies that persist with this gender pay gap the effects of it and Britain recently has been intriguing many people who did not know that they were being paid less than the man sitting next to them have suddenly realized that there is a significant gender pay gap and have added their voices to this issue and we've seen some significant changes in company policies as a consequence so it's been a very interesting development in addition to the other laws but despite all of this these trends and changes it is estimated according to the World Economic Forum the gender pay gap could take up to two hundred years to to close and what do you make of that yes that's very very slow isn't it their estimates I think are based on slow changes in education working through the system and they have a notion of this very long change in the pipeline and eventually is that these gender gaps will close so on the one hand it's optimistic in that they think that this will just happen on the other hand this is a very slow process another big argument that's been made though as well for it for the closing the gender pay gap is that it does have it does actually boost the economy have you have you seen evidence of that indeed this is part of some of the principles behind the United Nations sustainable development goals where goal 5 treats gender equality as a necessary component of sustainable economic growth so there is a wider recognition of these issues in international circles in the OECD and also within the United Nations but not every country in the world is signing up to that there are they it's very uneven you're absolutely right countries differ in the extent to which they adopt these policies there are enormous differences between countries in the extent to which women are included in the decision-making processes and this has significant impact on the development of those policies if you look at the countries with the narrowest gender gaps in decision-making for example the Nordic countries then you see the narrowest gaps in women's participation in in economic development so yes enormous differences in countries around the world and the the differences show in the outcome for both justice and economic growth Silvia Welby thanks for being with us thank you very much indeed now still to come on counting the cost Laos is in debt find out why that's ringing alarm bells and which country is lending it money the first changes to middle-east aviation this week could help bring costs down for passengers on Monday Ryanair said it's launching flights to Jordan for the first time the low-cost Irish airline already flies to Israel and Morocco its first route from a man in Jordan to Paphos in Cyprus will begin in March now billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk made headlines to this week his company SpaceX sent one of his Tesla electric cars into space Rob Reynolds reports with its 27 rocket engines roaring the SpaceX Falcon Heavy soared into the Florida sky it's the most powerful rocket on earth with a thrust equal to 18 747 jumbo jets working simultaneously at full power the successful launch gives a powerful boost to billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's company which wants lucrative contracts with NASA the US military and satellite companies on board the unmanned ship Musk's own cherry red Tesla Roadster from his electric car company with a space-suited dummy in the seat and a stereo playing the late David Bowie's Space Oddity on repeat the Rockets side boosters separated from the main body and flew back to earth touching down in a perfectly choreographed double landing the Boosters will eventually be reused on another mission another booster was designed to land aboard a ship at sea musk says Falcon heavies payload will go into an elliptical orbit of the Sun that extends as far out as the orbit of Mars and will continue circling for hundreds of millions of years some people have criticized the launch as an expensive stunt it came a day before Musk's Tesla electric car and energy storage company reported its biggest ever quarterly loss it lost more than 675 million dollars in the last three months of 2017 the company's been spending heavily as it rolls out the next duration of electric cars and social media platform twitter has reported its first ever quarterly net profit of 91 million dollars it could be a sign that advertisers are beginning to spread their online spending beyond Facebook and Google our production from US oil wells is at all-time highs US energy officials are predicting output will top 11 million barrels per day by the end of the year this could not come at a worse time for OPEC which is trying to cut production in order to wipe out oversupply concerns and support prices surging US oil production could upset the supply and demand equation in the whole global oil market and there are questions - over whether its potential is being overstated well joining us now from New York is Antoine House senior research scholar at the Columbia University Center on global energy policy as well as a founding partner of Kaos a data analytics company for the energy market so good to have you with us so let's start off then with that key question about whether demand will keep up with with this increase in supply to what extent is is this going to upset the whole supply and demand dynamic in the oil markets demand has been extremely robust the more we talk about peak demand and we talk about it a lot the more demand looks to be rising the stronger demand looks to be but probably the strengthened demand in the last few years has been really a response to low prices and you're right there's a concern that if prices go back up we would see some some demand response we tend to underestimate short term demand responses they're not so insignificant it seems and they've also been some significant technical improvements in in the whole shale process and the way they're able to get the the oil out and how quickly they're able to do that has that been a factor in all of this I think there's been lots of improvements I wouldn't say how quickly I think that's the opposite I think we a lot of the improvements the cost efficiency the cost savings have been realized in these four years three years of low prices have come at the expense of the rapid the ability to rapidly before ribs and rapidly bring supply out in fact if you if you look at the trend in the last year remember in 2017 for most of the year growth in shale disappointed was less than people expected and then just recently in September October November each other very very rapidly so is the International Energy Agency right in its in its estimates then are they are they are they over potentially overstating the how how far shale could go there's always a risk in all forecasting of extrapolating from the recent trend from the latest latest numbers so I think the IEA is absolutely right to underscore the significance of the shale revolution have bigger deal Isis this mean easily a game-changer in many ways but I think the latest forecast may be over-optimistic and may be putting too much faith in the in the most recent increases and extrapolating from them I think the the very steep gains we've seen are not something we're gonna see on there on a monthly basis we're gonna see from time to time so what does this potentially mean then for for Saudi Arabia and Russia and this forecast that the US will overtake them in in production what's your take on that yeah the forecast you know it's a it's a good headline that it's gonna overtake the Saudi Arabia and Russia it's only overtaking Saudi Arabia because Saudi Arabia is reining in production deliberately because of the coda that's the ceiling that's currently in place in in OPEC production you know Saudi Arabia could easily push back ahead of US production but I think is it's right do you not have a market it doesn't really matter who is on top buy a few barrels you have a market that's now dominated by three major players Russia San Rabia and the US and what happens with these three dominant players we suddenly have a leading impact on the market and it's all it's all quite a far cry from from what Saudi Arabia had been trying to do in the past which was to increase production in the hopes that that shale duction in the US would be driven out of business by the the lower prices because it wouldn't be economically feasible that strategy clearly hasn't worked has it if that's a strategy I'm not convinced that the strategy it might have been the case you know I think the strategy whatever it would what did whatever it was worked because the market has been rebalancing there's been a you know a very dramatic draw in inventories over the last more than half a year so we are seeing a rebalancing whether it's coming from shale upon from other sources of supply or from the strength of demand perhaps it doesn't matter so much for the Saudis or for anybody else in the market so how big a headache is US shale production for OPEC going forward them well it's something that nobody fully understands because it's a it's a young industry so there's still a learning curve it's still evolving things are moving constantly learning the technology if it evolves the political environment if I was the market environment evolves the castle characters investors are changing we've seen recently some of the private equity that had been making this movement shale production possible move away from shale so there's there's a lot of changes in this industry and I think it's a challenge for everyone to understand what the what the trends are what the what the prospects are what it outlook is and it's not different for the Saudis and 20-30 years but it's not necessarily all bad news or good news all right ant 1/2 could speak with you thank you having me you and finally concerns are growing about how much money the government in Laos is borrowing from China Wayne hey reports from the Lucian capital V NTN the coffee industry and Laos is one of the fastest growing in Asia its output is still small compared with regional leaders like Vietnam and Indonesia but fueled by increasing demand from neighboring China production grew by more than eight percent last year growers say Laos has a real opportunity to take the industry to the next level through improved infrastructure like better processing facilities we must have financing despite it being one of the few lao export products there's no sign the government is willing to help they thing always to develop the country on bigger projects on hydropower on mining big big factory but the small SMEs are not enough supporters indeed the government has big plans to shake off the tag of one of Asia's poorest countries it wants to graduate from the United Nations least developed country status in the next 12 years and it's turned to China to help fund big projects like this economic zone just outside the capital vientiane which is being built in anticipation of the city expanding quickly and a six billion dollar high-speed train line that will run from southern China to vientiane but the amount of money the Lao government is borrowing for the projects is causing concern public debt is estimated at around 68 percent of GDP and almost half of the money is being borrowed from one source China too much reliance on Chinese financial sources certainly would be risky because this country will be exposed to this business cycle of a China credit cycle of China the Lao government says big investment is vital if it's to improve the livelihood of its people one priority is health care which like many aspects of Lao society has fallen into disrepair through poor governance and neglect the main hospital in the capital was built by the French in 1903 and has had few improvements since but as part of the government's health care reforms work will soon begin on a new hospital to be built on the same size built with Chinese money and that is our show for this week get in touch with us by tweeting me at Haslem seeker and do use the hashtag a JCTC when you do or you can drop us an email
