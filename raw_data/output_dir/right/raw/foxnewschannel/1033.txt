ENDORSE THE PRESIDENT IN 2016.

26
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,512
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU GOING INTO

27
00:00:56,512 --> 00:01:00,449

28
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,183

00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:01,884
I'M JUST THRILLED TO HAVE THE

30
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:04,119
PRESIDENT ENDORSED THEM.

31
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:04,986
OF COURSE HE CAME DOWN AND HAD A

32
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:07,990
BIG RALLY AND FUNDRAISER IN A

33
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,459
SOBER AND NOW HE'S TREATED

34
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:10,759
AGAIN.

35
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:11,460
I'VE BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE A

36
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,229
NUMBER OF TIMES.

37
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:14,997
MOST RECENTLY WHEN WE SENT THE

38
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:17,833
TROOPS TO THE MEXICAN BORDER AT

39
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,233
HIS REQUEST.

40
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,536
I THINK HE'S GOING TO END UP

41
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:21,270
BEING ONE OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS

42
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,471
WE'VE EVER HAD.

43
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,372
NO DOUBT HE'S CHANGING THE

44
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:23,672
WORLD.

45
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:27,843
THE COUNTRY IS BOOMING IS SO A

46
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:28,911
SOUTH CAROLINA AND MUCH OF THAT

47
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:33,115
IS BECAUSE OF ONE MAN, DONALD

48
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:33,415
TRUMP.

49
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:34,083
ELIZABETH: WILL BE HONEST,

50
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,852
LOOKING AT STATEWIDE POLLING AND

51
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:37,586

IN HIS OUTSIDER SPEAKING OF THE

53
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,157
CAMPAIGN MESSAGE THAT WORKS, THE

54
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:45,894
OUTSIDER, THE BUSINESSMAN.

55
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:50,532
>> YEAH, IT DOES.

56
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:52,334
I'VE BEEN ELECTED OFFICE FOR

57
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:53,735
ALMOST 12 YEARS NOW.

58
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,772
I'VE SEEN CHANGES IN SOUTH

59
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:57,339
CAROLINA AND I'VE GOT

60
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:58,006
LEGISLATION PASSED TO CHANGE

61
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:02,277
THINGS AND HELP ANYTHING SAFER.

62
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:03,045
I DO NOT CANDIDATE RUNNING ON

63
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,913
EITHER PARTY THAT HAS EXPERIENCE

64
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,515
IN MONTFORT MADE.

65
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:07,249
I WORKED IN EDUCATION AS WELL.

66
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:10,285
THE WAY I SEE IT AS ECONOMIC

67
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,588
GROWTH AND PROSPERITY, ONE FOR

68
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:13,322
ITS BEEN A GOOD EDUCATION ARE

69
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:17,226
THE SAME THINGS THE PRESIDENT IS

70
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:18,694
FOR.

71
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:19,495
WE WANT TO PUT LAW ENFORCEMENT

72
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:22,097
OFFICERS IN EVERY SCHOOL TO KEEP

73
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:22,598
THE SHOOTERS OUT.

74
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:25,100
HE'S IN FAVOR OF THAT.

75
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,635
WE ARE DOING THINGS HERE.

76
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:27,402
I'M DOING THE THINGS HE'S DOING

77
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:31,707
THERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

78
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:32,474
JUST IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN IN

79
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:34,776
OFFICE, I DO NOT EXPLODE IN

80
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:36,945
DOLLARS IN NEW INVESTMENT AND

81
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:39,748
20,000 NEW JOBS.

82
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:40,415
THAT'S THE BEST RECORD WE'VE

83
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:43,318
EVER HAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND A

84
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:44,086
PART OF THAT OF COURSE IS DUE TO

85
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:47,456
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

86
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,624
ELIZABETH: THAT BEING SAID CAN

87
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:50,926
ASSERT THAT ONE OF THE MOST

88
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:51,627
CONSERVATIVE DISTRICTS IN THE

89
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:51,960
NATION.

90
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,297
WHAT IS SEPARATING YOU FROM THE

91
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:55,664
CANDIDATE?

92
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:56,365

REFORM THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE

95
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:01,870
BUILDING BEHIND ME.

96
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,940
HOW ARE YOU SEPARATING YOURSELF?

97
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,843
>> I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

98
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:10,212
LELAND: HOW ARE YOU SEPARATING

99
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:11,013
YOURSELF FROM OTHER CANDIDATES?

100
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:14,683
>> I'M THE ONE THAT HAS THE

101
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:15,484
RECORD.

102
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:16,385
RONALD REAGAN'S FIRST UNITED

104
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,022
ASPECTS IN VOTER FRAUD AND ALSO

105
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:20,756
DRUG SMUGGLERS COME TO SEND TO

106
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:22,858
JAIL AS ATTORNEY GENERAL.

107
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:26,628
ONE AFTER CRIMINAL DOMESTIC

108
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:27,396
VIOLENCE.

109
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,464
JUST IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN

110
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,533
GOVERNOR, AS I'VE SAID, WE'VE

111
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,069
WORKED HARD WITH A NEW KIND OF

112
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:35,837
PROSPERITY JOINING THE

113
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,040
BRAINPOWER OF RESEARCH

114
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,508
UNIVERSITIES OF THEIR GREAT

00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:40,242
TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM WITH

116
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:43,245
THESE FANTASTIC COMPANIES COMING

117
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:44,246
HERE AND WE'VE ANNOUNCED AS THEY

118
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:47,516
SAY THAT 6 BILLION IN INVESTMENT

119
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:48,116
AND 20,000 NEW AND WE'RE

120
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:50,986
SUPERCHARGING THAT RIGHT NOW.

121
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:52,988
>> I WANT OUR VIEWERS TO GET A

122
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,223
TASTE OF THE CAMPAIGN

123
00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:55,157
COMMERCIALS WE SEE DOWN SOUTH

124
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:55,757
AND GET YOUR REACTION.

125
00:03:55,757 --> 00:04:00,796
TAKE A LISTEN, SIR.

126
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:01,463
>> WE ARE UNAFRAID TO TAKE A

127
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:04,466
STAND ON WHAT IS RIGHT.

128
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:09,338
WE LOVE GOD AND WE LOVE YOU.

129
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:10,072
>> SOUTH CAROLINA IS THE MOST

130
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:13,041
CONSERVATIVE STATE IN AMERICA.

131
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,709
BUT OUR CURRENT POLITICIANS

132
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,346
CONSTANTLY INCREASE SPENDING AND

133
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,281
THEN COVER THEIR CORRUPT, YOU

134
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:19,880
KNOW WHY.

135
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,584
>> IT SEEMS AS IF EVERYONE IS

136
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:25,087
STRIVING TO BE MORE

137
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:25,520
CONSERVATIVE.

138
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,188
I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT IT'S

139
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:28,323
GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHEN

140
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:30,726
VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS ON

141
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:32,828
TUESDAY AND COULD THIS GO TO A

142
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:33,729
RUNOFF AS IT OFTEN DOES IN SOUTH

143
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:34,096
CAROLINA?

144
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:37,633
IT SHOULD.

145
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:38,367
WE WILL WIN THE PRIMARY AND IF

146
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:42,137
WE DON'T WIN THAT, WE WILL WIN

147
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:42,838
THE RUNOFF AND THEN WIN THE

148
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:46,241
GENERAL ELECTION.

149
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:46,908
I THINK THE VOTERS IN SOUTH

150
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:48,110
CAROLINA ARE CONSERVATIVE.

151
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,245
I HAVE A CONSERVATIVE RECORD.

152
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:52,481
I'VE DONE THESE THINGS AND ALSO

153
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,149
DONE THE KIND OF THINGS RESIDENT

154
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:56,952
TRUMP IS DOING.

155
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:57,886
HE'S THE REASON THIS COUNTRY IS

156
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,721
FLOURISHING AND WE WANT TO KEEP

157
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,455
THAT GOING AND WHEN YOU WIN LIKE

158
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:03,091
WE WIN HERE WITH 6 BILLION IN

159
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,494
CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND 20,000

160
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:09,031
NEW JOBS IN A RECORD.

161
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:09,698
COMMENT YOU DON'T HIRE THE

162
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,433
EXPERIENCE COACH.

163
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:15,304
YOU GIVE BACK COACH MORE YEARS

164
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,872
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING

165
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:17,539
PEOPLE TO DO.

166
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:18,106
>> A BOOK ON TUESDAY.

167
00:05:18,106 --> 00:00:00,000
KEEP YOU POSTED.
