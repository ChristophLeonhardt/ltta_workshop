1
00:00:02,423 --> 00:00:03,157
WEAPONS OF INTELLIGENCE AGAINST

2
00:00:03,157 --> 00:00:06,527
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, LIKE WE'VE

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:08,563
BEEN EXPOSING ON THIS PROGRAM.

4
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:11,666
JOINING US NOW, NRA TV COUNTRY

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:12,200
PETER DAN BONGINO.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,269
DANIEL HOFFMAN.

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:15,837
DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.

8
00:00:15,837 --> 00:00:20,875
WE WILL START WITH YOU.

9
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,342
DANIEL HOFFMAN.

10
00:00:21,342 --> 00:00:22,944
I INTERVIEWED JOSE RODRIGUEZ, HE

11
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:23,311
WAS THERE.

12
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:29,283
I DON'T LIKE HEARING THE TAPE

13
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:30,885
ANYMORE BECAUSE I AIRED AT THE

14
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,688
LAST TWO NIGHTS MY LOOK

15
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:34,088
SKINNIER.

16
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:35,690
HE WAS THERE, THE INFORMATION

17
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,558
THAT LED TO THE COURIER THAT LED

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:38,526
TO BIN LADEN CAME FROM THAT

19
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:40,895
ENHANCED INTERROGATION.

20
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:42,497
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN

21
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:43,498
BIN LADEN WITHOUT THOSE

22
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,433
TECHNIQUES WHICH WERE MEDICALLY

23
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,635
SUPERVISED AT THE HIGHEST DEGREE

24
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:49,904
OF SAFETY, ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T

25
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:50,505
KNOW IT.

26
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:52,006
>> WRIGHT, SEAN.

27
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:52,707
THERE'S A COUPLE POINTS HERE I

28
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:54,542
WOULD HIGHLIGHT.

29
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,110
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S AN

30
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,078
UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH FOR THOSE

31
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:57,779
WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT THE PROGRAM

32
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,081
AND DON'T TODAY.

33
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,116
THAT YES, IT ACTUALLY DID WORK.

34
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:03,351
YOU CAN DEBATE THE MORALS AND

35
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:05,519
ETHICS OF THE PROGRAM BUT IT DID

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,521
WORK.

37
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:07,288
WE DID OBTAIN SIGNIFICANCE

38
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:09,123
INTELLIGENCE NOT JUST ON FINDING

39
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:10,158
BIN LADEN BUT OTHER AL QAEDA

40
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:12,427
OPERATIVES AS WELL AS WE STOP

41
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:13,094
THREATS AGAINST OUR NATION.

42
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:14,595
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF WE HAD

43
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:16,731
THESE TECHNIQUES AND THEY WERE

44
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:18,166
APPROVED AND WE HAD SOMEONE IN

45
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,701
DETENTION WHO KNEW ABOUT A

46
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:22,970
THREAT AND AN ATTACK TOOK PLACE

47
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,971
ON AFTERWARDS, POSTMORTEM, WE

48
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:25,907
WERE ASKED IF WE DID ALL WE

49
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:27,508
COULD AND USED ALL OF OUR

50
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:29,310
CAPABILITIES AND WE REPLY THAT

51
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:29,710
WE DID NOT.

52
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,312
I THINK THOSE SAME CONGRESSMEN

53
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:33,681
WHO ARE GRILLING GINA HASPEL

54
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,917
WOULD HAVE CONFRONTED US OVER

55
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:36,451
DERELICTION OF DUTY.

56
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:38,319
>> Sean: LET ME GO TO

57
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,287
DR. GORKA.

58
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:40,021
DR. GORKA, THIS IS ONE OF THE

59
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:42,490
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE

60
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,792
COUNTRY AND LOOK, IT WAS THE LOT

61
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,494
THE TIME.

62
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,463
ALSO IT WAS UNDER THE HIGHEST

63
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:51,499
LEVEL OF MEDICAL SUPERVISION.

64
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,701
WE ARE NOT, SOME OF THESE

65
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,902
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS SUGGEST, WE

66
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:56,304
ARE NOT THE ENEMY.

67
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:58,206
NOW, THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN

68
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,774
IT WAS MEDICALLY SUPERVISED, BUT

69
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:03,144
THEY DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT.

70
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:05,713
IN THE AFTERMATH OF 3,000

71
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:07,315
AMERICANS KILLED, WE NEEDED

72
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:08,316
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT ELSE

73
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:10,318
MIGHT BE COMING, WHAT DANGERS

74
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,487
EXIST, AND I THINK SHE AND

75
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:13,154
OTHERS DID AMERICA A GREAT

76
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:15,990
SERVICE HERE.

77
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,428
>> THIS WOMAN IS A PATRIOT AND A

78
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:22,930
30-YEAR PLUS VETERAN OF THE

79
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,531
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

80
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,499
PERSONALLY, AND I'M NOT GOING TO

81
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,801
GO INTO THE DETAILS, I HAVE SOME

82
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:27,435
ISSUES WITH ENHANCED

83
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,302
INTERROGATION BECAUSE OF THE

84
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:31,506
DANGER IT CAN LEAD TO A PEOPLE

85
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:32,306
FABRICATING INFORMATION TO GET

86
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,908
YOU TO STOP DOING WHAT YOU ARE

87
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:34,709
DOING TO THEM.

88
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,443
BUT LOOK AT THE FACTS.

89
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:41,482
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THREE

90
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:41,916
PEOPLE, SEAN.

91
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:42,450
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

92
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,484
INTERROGATIONS THAT LED TO THE

93
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:46,287
SAVING OF LIVES UNDOUBTEDLY.

94
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:47,922
AND THE LAST POINT IS ONE OF

95
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:48,222
HONOR.

96
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:52,426
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WERE FINE

97
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:53,694
WITH THESE TECHNIQUES, AND ALL

98
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,696
OF THESE PEOPLE WERE FINE WITH

99
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,733
THIS WOMAN WHEN SHE WAS ACTING

100
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,401
DIRECTOR I NEVER QUESTIONED HER

101
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,538
INTEGRITY OR HER MORALS.

102
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:04,672
AND THAT IS DESPICABLE THAT

103
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:08,976
THESE COWARDS NOW ARE ATTACKING

104
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,712
HER FOR EXACTLY THE THINGS THEY

105
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:13,114
APPROVED OF AFTER 9/11.

106
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:13,981
>> Sean: WELL SAID.

107
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:15,917
DAN BONGINO, LET ME TURN TO

108
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:16,350
OTHER TOPICS.

109
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,120
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOWED MILITARY

110
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,721
FORCE AFTER MISSILES WERE FIRED

111
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,423
OVER JAPAN AND THREATS TO GUAM

112
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:25,159
AND EVEN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.

113
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,361
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT SANCTIONS ON

114
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:28,062
NORTH KOREA.

115
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:28,696
PRESIDENT TRUMP MOCKED THE

116
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:30,932
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR.

117
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,366
THE MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATS SAID HE

118
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,201
WOULD START A NUCLEAR WAR.

119
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,703
WHAT IF WE HAD SO FAR?

120
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:36,737
WE'VE HAD CONCESSIONS.

121
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:38,706
THREE AMERICANS HOME SAFELY

122
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:39,941
TODAY.

123
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,109
WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD SEE

124
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,110
KIM JONG UN CROSS THE DMZ INTO

125
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,279
THE ARMS OF THE SOUTH KOREAN

126
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,514
PRESIDENT.

127
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,982
WE SEE NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF

128
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:49,684
THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

129
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,152
KOREAN PENINSULA IN TOTAL.

130
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:52,019
WE HAVE SEEN OTHER CONCESSIONS.

131
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,922
THIS IS AN AMAZING TEACHABLE

132
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,290
MOMENT FOR PEACE THROUGH

133
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,325
STRENGTH, IS IT NOT?

134
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:59,760
>> IT IS, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP

135
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,330
WILL GET ZERO CREDIT BECAUSE

136
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,564
THE, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO BE

137
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:04,298
CAREFUL.

138
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,300
I GET REALLY UPSET, SEAN,

139
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,903
BECAUSE THE THINK TANK PEOPLE

140
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:10,171
AND THE SWAMP RATS, THE SLOBS

141
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:12,540
WHO HAVE BEEN IN POWER FOREVER

142
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,808
WHO FOLLOW THE STRUCTURED PATHS

143
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:14,709
OF FORMAL DIPLOMACY.

144
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,510
THEY HAVE HAD THEIR BOW TIES ON.

145
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,712
THEY'VE HAD THEIR COCKTAIL

146
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:18,312
LUNCHES.

147
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:19,647
THEY ARE THE ONES LAUGHING AT

148
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:20,947
TRUMP RIGHT NOW DESPITE THE FACT

149
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:23,184
THAT HE'S GOT RESULTS THAT NONE

150
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:24,352
OF THEM COULD GET.

151
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:26,320
THEY THINK HE'S SOME KIND OF

152
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,221
NEANDERTHAL CREEP.

153
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,322
THEY FOLLOWED ALL THE FORMAL

154
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:30,524
PATHS, PLAYED BY ALL THE RULES.

155
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:31,559
YOU KNOW WHAT PROMPTED?

156
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,560
HE CAME IN THERE.

157
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,128
HE WASN'T USED TO THESE RULES.

158
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:35,229
HE WAS A BUILDER FROM QUEENS AND

159
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:36,163
HE SAID WAIT.

160
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:37,331
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, THERE

161
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,267
ARE STILL NUKES ON THE PENINSULA

162
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:40,034
DESPITE THE SMART PEOPLE TELLING

163
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:42,169
US HOW TO GET RID OF IT.

164
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,137
HE WAS UNPREDICTABLE, AND HE'S

165
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:45,006
THE ONE WHO GOT RESULTS, AND HE

166
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:47,041
WON'T GET AN OUNCE OF CREDIT FOR

167
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:47,775
IT AMONGST THAT CLASS.

168
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,043
>> Sean: AS HE SAID, HE JUST

169
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:50,444
WANTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WHICH

170
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:53,514
BY THE WAY I REMEMBER

171
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:54,315
WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID BLOOD,

172
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:56,284
TOIL, TEARS, SWEAT, VICTORY.

173
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:57,485
THAT'S OUR GOAL.

174
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:58,286
THE PRESIDENT THEY SAID I WANT

175
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:00,755
THE WORLD SAFER.

176
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:02,690
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE ISRAELIS.

177
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,692
DANIEL HOFFMAN, THEY HAD TO

178
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:05,660
STRIKE BACK.

179
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,895
YOU CANNOT ALLOW THE IRANIAN

180
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:09,697
FORCES AND MULLAHS TO FIRE

181
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,332
MISSILES FROM SYRIA BASES INTO

182
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:12,533
ISRAEL AND NOT HAVE A MASSIVE

183
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,535
PRICE TO PAY.

184
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:16,704
>> THE VIEWERS WILL RECALL THAT

185
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:18,339
NO MATTER WHAT THREAT, WHETHER

186
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:20,708
IT'S AN IRAQI NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN

187
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,510
THE 1980s OR A SYRIAN NUCLEAR

188
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,678
PROGRAM WHICH ISRAEL DESTROYED

189
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:26,514
IN 2007, THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE

190
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,316
THE THREATS OFF THE TABLE.

191
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:29,317

00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:32,286
IN THIS CASE THE IRANIANS

194
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:33,054
PRESENTED AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT

195
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,288
TO THEM FROM SYRIA.

196
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:37,124
FRANKLY, SEAN, EXPECT ISRAEL TO

197
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:37,925

198
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:40,328
OPERATIONS TO GET THERE IS A

199
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:40,728

00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:41,729
>> Sean: LET'S SAY A STEP

201
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:42,330
FURTHER.

202
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,732
I THINK THE PRESIDENT, WILL BY

203
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:49,103

AMERICA'S LEADING OF THE WORLD

208
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:55,343
STAGE.

209
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:56,577
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE

210
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:59,146
I THINK TO SEND THE WORLD,

211
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,582
WHETHER OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES LIKE

212
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:03,617
IT OR NOT, I FRANKLY DON'T CARE.

213
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:06,153
>> THEY ARE GOING TO TOW THE

214
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:06,520
LINE.

215
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,155
THEY WILL MOAN AND MOAN BUT THEY

216
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:10,124
WILL FOLLOW OUR LEAD BECAUSE WE

217
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:11,926
ARE THE ONLY LEADERS OUT THERE.

218
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:13,327
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IN THE 20TH

219
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,628
CENTURY AND THAT'S HOW IT'S

220
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:16,197
GOING TO WORK UNDER DONALD TRUMP

221
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,934
IN THE 21ST CENTURY.

222
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:20,534
THAT'S POWER, POLITICS.

223
00:06:20,534 --> 00:00:00,000
THE BOTTOM LINE IS VERY SIMPLE.
