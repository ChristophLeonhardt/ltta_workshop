RECOVERY AND IT'S NOTHING MORE SERIOUS. Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUCH. KRISTIN FISHER OUT THERE IN THE POURING RAIN AT WALTER REED TONIGHT. ALSO BREAKING TONIGHT, A HISTORIC MOMENT, CLASHES WITH SOME DEADLY CHAOS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS THE U.S. OFFICIALLY OPENED THE EMBASSY NOW IN JERUSALEM. WE WELCOME YOU OFFICIALLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO KEEP YOUR PROMISES. WE STAND TOGETHER BECAUSE WE BELIEVE DEMOCRACY IS WORTH DEFENDING. THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS BE A GREAT FRIEND OF ISRAEL AND A PARTNER IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND PEACE. Martha: A LOT OF POSITIVE CELEBRATION ON THAT SIDE. BUT AT LEAST 55 PEOPLE ARE DEAD AT THIS HOUR. IF THE INTERNATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS ALREADY BEING FELT. TURKEY TONIGHT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL PULL THEIR AMBASSADORS OUT OF ISRAEL AND OUT OF THE UNITED STATES IN RESPONSE TO THIS MOVE. THIS IS THE QUESTION, IS AT THE BEGINNING OF A POWER SHIFT IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT COULD LEAD ULTIMATELY TO PEACE, OR DOES IT MARK THE END OF THE PEACE PROCESS IN THE BEGINNING OF MORE VIOLENCE TO COME? JOINING ME NOW, KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT. TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. EARLIER TODAY ROCHE TOP WAS SPEAKING WITH THE PRESS. HE SAID HE BELIEVES IN TERMS OF THIS VIOLENCE THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTS SQUARELY WITH HAMAS. IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE PERSPECTIVE ON THE? WE THINK THESE DEATHS ARE TRAGIC OF COURSE. AND A LOSS OF LIFE IS. AT THE SAME TIME THEY BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR KILLING THESE INDIVIDUALS. THIS PRESIDENT MADE GOOD ON THE PROMISE OF FOUR PRESIDENTS, THE PREVIOUS THREE PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM ALL PROMISED TO DO WITH THIS PRESIDENT DID, WHICH IS TO RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AS ISRAEL IS DUE AND TO MOVE OUR U.S. EMBASSY THERE. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SAID AS SOON AS HE GOT INTO OFFICE HE WOULD DO THAT. IT WAS NOT DONE. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT JERUSALEM, ISRAEL MUST REMAIN UNDIVIDED AND THAT JERUSALEM WILL ALWAYS BE ITS CAPITAL. IN THIS WAY THE PRESIDENT IS ONLY RECOGNIZING REALITY. BUT I THINK IT ALSO, THE VIOLENCE IN THE LOSS OF LIFE, MARTHA, UNDERSCORES THAT THIS IS A VERY FRAUGHT PROCESS AND THAT HAMAS HAS BEEN CAUSING TROUBLE IN GAZA FOR A VERY LONG TIME. Martha: IT RAISES THE OBVIOUS QUESTION, ONCE THAT MOVE HAS BEEN MADE, AND AS YOU SAY IT HAS BEEN PROMISED BY SEVERAL U.S. PRESIDENTS AND NOW CARRY THROUGH BY PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WE KNOW THAT JARED KUSHNER AND OTHERS HAVE WORKED ON THE PEACE PROCESS. WHERE IS THAT PEACE PROCESS NOW? WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE? WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT PEACE PROCESS OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR GREATEST ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE STATE OF ISRAEL. AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY THAT A NUMBER OF ALLIES ARE JOINING WITH THIS PRESIDENT WHEN HE'S TAKING SUCH BOLD ACTIONS AROUND THE GLOBE OTHERWISE. LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH NORTH KOREA. YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS BY A 2-1 MARGIN APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE PRESIDENT WANTING TO SIT DOWN WITH NORTH KOREA AND HAVE THIS SUMMIT. WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE FAVORABLE ON THIS ACTION. Martha: I DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT NORTH KOREA BUT I WANT TO STAY BACK WITH ISRAEL FOR ONE MOMENT BECAUSE FRANCE URGED ISRAEL TO USE RESTRAINT DURING THE COURSE OF THIS PROCESS. WHAT IS THE UNITED STATES' STANCE TOWARDS ISRAEL ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AT THE BORDER? IS THE PRESIDENT ALSO URGING MORE RESTRAINT? BECAUSE TOMORROW THERE COULD BE AN ESCALATION AS THEY REMEMBER AND RECOGNIZE THE DAY THAT ISRAEL BECAME A STATE. WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE TELLING ISRAEL ABOUT THEIR REACTION IN THEIR RESPONSE? THE PRESIDENT AND THE UNITED STATES REMAIN VERY INVOLVED IN THE PEACE PROCESS. SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO HAS IT RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF. THIS PRESIDENT ALSO MADE CLEAR ON DECEMBER 6TH WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD MOVE THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM THAT THE BORDERS ARE LEFT TO THE PEOPLE THERE, THAT THE U.S. IS NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN THAT. BUT WE RECOGNIZE A SOVEREIGN NATION SHOULD HAVE BORDERS AND WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR CAPITAL IS WHERE THEY SAY IT IS. WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THE VIOLENCE AND THE LOSS OF LIFE AS WELL. Martha: I JUST WANT TO PLAY A SOUND BITE FROM JOHN BRENNAN AND THEN FROM MIKE POMPEO, THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE AND GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. KIM JONG UN, WHO I DESPISED BECAUSE OF THE BRUTALITY THAT HE HAS PUT UP ON THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK HE HAS BEEN MASTERFUL IN HOW WE HAS MANIPULATED PERCEPTIONS AND MANIPULATED AND QUITE FRANKLY DUPED MR. TRUMP. I THINK FORMER DIRECTOR BRENNAN'S REMARKS ARE SILLY ON THEIR FACE. WE ARE GOING TO ENTER INTO A SET OF DISCUSSIONS WITH TWO NATIONS DOING THEIR BEST TO ACHIEVE OUTCOMES FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR OBJECTIVES AND GOALS. Martha: JOHN BRENNAN STATEMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DUPED INTO THIS MEETING WITH KIM JONG UN. THAT'S A VERY IRRESPONSIBLE, IT'S NOT A RATIONAL STATEMENT FOR SEVERAL REASONS. YOU SEE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE AISLE AND AS IDRISS REMARKED EARLIER, IN THE POLLS, DEMOCRATS, WOMEN, COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS THAT WE ARE CONTINUALLY TOLD DON'T SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT IS MUCH, THEY VERY MUCH SUPPORT TAKING THIS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA. IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING, PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER, 50 PLUS AT 55 PLUS, THEY CERTAINLY DO BECAUSE THEY LIVED THROUGH DECADES OF WAR. THEY'VE GROWN UP ONLY KNOWING WAR BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA. I WOULD SAY THAT MR. BRENNAN AND OTHERS WHO STARTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE OURS SHOULD REMEMBER THAT OLD SAYING THAT POLITICS STOPS AT THE WATER'S EDGE. THESE ARE DECIDEDLY NONPARTISAN ISSUES LOOKING FOR BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION COULD AT LEAST SEE THE PROSPECTS, THE PROSPECT OF OPENING UP RELATIONS THERE AND DENUCLEARIZING THE KOREAN PENINSULA. NORTH KOREA HAS ALREADY COME AND GET TO THIS PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP, RELEASED THOSE THREE AMERICANS BACK HERE AND EVEN THEN PEOPLE COULDN'T JUST APPLAUD IT AND SAY ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL DAY FOR THOSE THREE MEN TO BE FREE, THEY HAD TO MAKE IT PARTISAN AND POLITICAL AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S POLL NUMBERS ARE IMPROVING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO TIRED OF THE REFLEXIVE INVECTIVE AND THE INABILITY AND THE IRRATIONALITY OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SAY TODAY WAS A GOOD DAY FOR AMERICA. FINALLY ON THE PART OF NORTH KOREA, THIS PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT THINGS ARE LOOKING VERY PROMISING. THE SUMMIT IS SET FOR JUNE 12TH, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THAT THESE CONDITIONS NEED TO BE MET. BUT SO FAR WE LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SUSPENDING THEIR TESTS. THEY ARE RELEASING AMERICANS AND THIS PRESIDENT FEELS THAT WE ARE AT A VERY GOOD PLACE MOVING FORWARD TO JUNE 12TH. Martha: I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHT ON ONE LESS THING AND THIS IS A CORRUPT WEEK FROM TODAY ON LEAKERS. HE SAID THE SO-CALLED LEAKS COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ARE A MASSIVE OVER EXAGGERATION PUT UP A FAKE NEWS MEDIA IN ORDER TO MAKE US LOOK AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. WITH THAT BEING SAID, LEAKERS ARE TRAITORS AND COWARDS AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE. CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS LEAKING FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE DONE? I WON'T TELL YOU THE PROCESS SO MUCH AS TO TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF LEAKS. SOME LEAKS EXIST TO HURT COLLEAGUES, SOME LEAKS EXIST BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE WITH THE POLICIES THAT ARE BEING PUT FORTH, BUT NONE OF THEM ARE HELPFUL AND I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON IN THIS WHITE HOUSE BUT NOT AS BADLY AS IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING, IT'S NOT SO MUCH LEAKING AS USING THE MEDIA TO SHIV EACH OTHER. THAT WAS GOING ON QUITE A BIT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUT IT'S LESS SO NOW. I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS ON SOLID GROUND HERE, THAT IF YOU WORK AT THE PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT LIKE WE ALL DO HERE AND YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE AND THE BLESSING OF COMING EVERY DAY TO WORK IN THIS WHITE HOUSE ON BEHALF OF THE NATION THAT WE ALL LOVE THEN YOU WANT TO BE COMPETENT, YOU WANT TO BE LOYAL AND YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REINFORCE THE AGENDA THAT PREVAILED HERE. I CAN'T GO ON MORE BUT I HAVE SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THIS VERY TOPIC TODAY. Martha: DO YOU EXPECT PERSONNEL CHANGES AS A RESULT?
