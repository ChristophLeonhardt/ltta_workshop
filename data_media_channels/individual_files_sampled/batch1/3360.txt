if you get your medical advice from a Las Vegas magician you are an idiot and you deserve to die that was really really fat I was American they wanted to do a our stomach sleeve on me they wanted to force me medically to not be able to swallow as much I decided to try something even more radical I picked two weeks to eat a mono diet and what I ate during that two weeks didn't matter very much as long as it was just one thing and a whole thing and no spices nothing what I chose was potatoes because it's the funniest and I ate two weeks of potatoes and after that my habits had changed and right now it's been 17 months and I eat no animal products and no refined grains extremely low salt sugar and oil made a lot of salads fruits occasional nuts not to anything get in trouble with they'll give you a lot of calories and one of the things I learned of this diet was you know you can just not eat once in a while and for 17 months I've kept the weight on now the studies will tell you that two years is the magic point so I'm not quite there yet but so far the weights staying off and I feel fantastic
