AS MUCH AS I HATE INTERNET
TROLLS, THEY MADE A MOVE
THIS WEEK THAT IS ACTUALLY
PRETTY FUNNY.
BASICALLY THEY TRICKED
CONSERVATIVES IN HOUSTON INTO
SHOWING UP TO PROTECT THE STATUE
OF THE STATE OF SLAVEOWNING
SAM HOUSTON WHICH THE CITY GOT
THEIR NAME FROM.
THIS WAS FUELED BY A MAY 19
FACEBOOK POST FROM A GROUP
CALLED TEXAS NT FILE WHICH
STANDS FOR ANTIFASCIST AND IS A
FAKE GROUP.
RUMORS SWIRLED THAT THE LEFTIST
GROUPS ONE OF THE SAME
HOUSTON MONUMENT TO THE NEXT
SPARKING AN INTENSIVE DON'T
MESS WITH TEXAS CAMPAIGN.
ON THE ANSI FOR FAKE FACEBOOK
POST THEY SAID WE ARE ABOUT TO
HAVE A HUGE EVENT IN HOUSTON
JUNE 10 WITH THE COMBINED FORCES
OF SEVERAL LARGE GROUPS, PERHAPS
THE BIGGEST EVER TO THE FASCIST
BETTER NOT SHOW UP OR THEY WILL
BE LIMPING HOME BRUISED, BROKEN,
HER AND CRYING WITH THEIR TAILS
TUCKED BETWEEN THEIR LEGS THAT
ANY TIME SOMEONE SAYS THIS
PERSON BETTER NOT SHOW UP,
THAT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR DAD WAS
LIKE YOU BETTER NOT GO TO
BED NOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU BETTER NOT YOUR VEGGIES
BEFORE DESSERT.
THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY ARE
DOING.
LET'S LOOK AT THE FACEBOOK POST
HERE.
THIS IS TEXAS FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS
RESPONDED AND SAID THEIR
GOAL IS TO REMOVE THE SAME
HOUSTON STATUTE.
MANY OF THESE COMMUNIST PUNKS
ARE EMBOLDENED AFTER THEY
LAY CLAIM TO A WIN IN NEW
ORLEANS BY BRINGING DOWN
THE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS.
WE HAD BY ALL THREE PRESENTERS,
KEEPERS, MILITIAS, TEA
PARTIERS, LIBERTY LOVING TEXANS,
LIBERTY LOVING AMERICANS,
"ORGANIZATIONS AND ANYONE WHO
LOVES TEXAS AND WANTS TO
PROTECT OUR SOVEREIGN SOIL AND
HISTORY TO JOIN DEATH.
JOIN ESTIMATED THAT THEY SWARMED
HERMAN PARKER EARLY IN THE
MORNING THAT IN KIMMEL, LEATHER
VEST, INFO WAS JACKETS, AND
TEXAS PRIDE SHIRTS TOTING
AMERICAN TEXAN AND DON'T
TREAD ON ME FLIGHTS, STAND
WITH SAME SIGNS AND SEMI
AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND SNIPERS.
THERE WAS A 40 PERSON DEEP
SECURITY TEAM PATROLLING
THE AREA WHILE THE HYDRATION
TEAM PASSED OUT WATER WAITING
IN THE TEXAS SUMMER HEAT FOR THE
ENEMY LEFTIST GROUPS TO ARRIVE.
BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY NEVER DID
BECAUSE IT WAS COMPLETELY
VACANT THEY WERE TROLLING THEM.
ALSO THEY KIND OF MISS THE POINT
SAYING THAT THEY WERE STANDING
UP FOR THEIR CONFEDERATE
LEADERS BECAUSE SAM HOUSTON WAS
NEVER A CONFEDERATE LEADER DIED
IN FACT, HE SAID HE DIDN'T
WANT TO JOIN THE CONFEDERACY.
KIND OF MISS THE POINT THERE.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT PEOPLE
WHO GO AROUND WEARING INFO
WAS JACKETS DON'T NECESSARILY
KNOW THEIR HISTORY AND ARE
EASILY TAKEN IN BY HOAXES
CLUSTER
I'M SAYING THEY MIGHT NOT
ANOTHER INFO.
THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A WAR
ON INFO.
THAT IS SORT OF EMBARRASSING.
THEY DON'T CARE.
THEY'RE HAPPY DUCK
KNOW, BECAUSE THEY WROTE WE
STILL ACHIEVED OUR GOAL,
OUR GOAL OF BEING TROLLED.
TO WALK AROUND WITH CAMO AND
A GUN A GUEST.
THAT IS THEIR GOAL.
IT'S WHAT HAD DIVISIVE AND
DEFENSIVE THE WRITING THAT SO
QUICKLY THAT THESE COMMUNIST
THINK THEY CAN COME OVER HERE
AFTER THEIR WIN IN NEW ORLEANS
AND IT IS LIKE I DON'T THINK THE
MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS WAS BEING
COMMUNIST WHEN HE MADE THIS VERY
WELL THOUGHT OUT DECLARATION OF
WHY THIS CONFEDERATE MONUMENT
SHOULD BE REMOVED AND THEN WE
GET TO, ALL OF YOU SHOULD COME
STAND UP FOR AMERICA AND OPEN
CARRY AND IT IS JUST LIKE,
SO QUICKLY PARTISAN AND DIVISIVE
AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE
THAT WAY.
THIS IS AN IMAGINARY ENEMY.
NONE OF THIS IS REAL AND IT WAS
SO FAST TO JOIN UP ARMS AND
START A WAR AGAINST SOMETHING
THAT DIDN'T EXIST A
OR AT LEAST WANT TO DUCK
A MAYBE OWN FEARS.
THE BEST PART IS THEY GOT
RILED UP SO QUICKLY BUT
THEN THEY WERE CHANTING ABOUT
LIVE TARTS AND SNOWFLAKES.
WHO IS GETTING RILED UP VERY
QUICKLY HERE.
WHERE THE SNOWFLAKES?
THERE SAYING THESE CROWDS
GATHERED THERE, THE SAYING SOME
OF THE NUMBERS MIGHT BE OVER
EXAGGERATED BECAUSE THERE WAS A
NEARBY ANTI-SHARIA PROTEST
AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF
POTENTIALLY SOME PEOPLE GOT
CONFUSED AND DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO GO SO THEY WENT WITH
THIS CROWD.
EITHER WAY, THEY WERE ON THE
WRONG SIDE.
THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME
OVER LACK AND THE CROWDS OF
THOSE TWO EVENTS AND YES, I DO
BUY THAT THE SOURCE OF GUYS
WHO WHICH OVER THIS EVENT WOULD
SATURATE NUMBERS FROM TIME
TO TIME DIED CHILDREN THE
PRODUCTION MEETING, I GENERALLY
THINK THAT TROLLING IS A
GIGANTIC WASTE OF TIME AND THAT
HUMANITY COULD IT, SO I STOPPED
TRYING TO EMOTIONALLY INSTIGATE
EACH OTHER BUT IF YOU ARE GOING
TO TROLL, THIS IS OKAY.
IT IS FIND THAT SAYING THEY'RE
GOING TO TRY TO THIS
MONUMENT, I GUESS BUT THE THING
IS IT IS SO BELIEVABLE.
YEAH, A LOT OF MONUMENTS HAVE
BEEN TAKEN DOWN SO I GET
WHY YOU WOULD SHOW UP THERE.
THE PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP THERE
DON'T REALLY LOOK THAT
RIDICULOUS.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TROLL
THESE SORTS OF PEOPLE, YOU
MAKE A FAKE STATUE FOR A PERSON
THAT NEVER EXISTED, BUT
THAT SOMEWHERE AND THEN SAY
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT
DOWN AND WATCH THEM TALK TO
DEFENDANT THAT THAT'S A
MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA THAT YOU
MAKE A GOOD POINT, HAVING
THESE PEOPLE SHOW UP AND EXCLAIM
THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH THE START
THEIR LOVE FOR WEBSTER
MCDANIEL.
I THINK SOMETHING ELSE THAT
WAS IMPORTANT I CAME OUT OF
THIS IS THEY SPENT THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS ON SUPPLIES STORE
AND THEMSELVES FOR THIS SO THEY
ARE REMOVING SOME OF THE
FUNDING FOR THESE FASCIST
GROUPS.
I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU, THE
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THEY SPENT
ON THEMSELVES WOULD'VE OTHERWISE
BEEN SPENT ON ARMING THEMSELVES
I THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY DON'T
MIND BY NEXT DRAMA.
BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING
LIKE OH, I AM ANTI-ANTI-FASCIST.
THAT IS SO BIZARRE.
THAT'S AWARE THING TO SAY.
IT IS LIKE SAYING I AM A FASCIST
DIET
BASICALLY.
BUT ALSO ONE OF THE OTHER
COMMENTS ON THIS FACEBOOK
THIS IS TEXAS, THEY CALL
THEMSELVES, I'VE NEVER
HEARD THIS AND MAYBE I AM LIVING
UNDER A ROCK, INSTEAD OF
ALL'S RIGHT THEY CALL THEMSELVES
NIGHTS.
SO IT'S LIKE SAYING, INSTEAD
OF TAKING ON SOME OF THE
NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS WITH ALL'S
RIGHT THERE SAYING WE BELIEVE
ON THESE THINGS BUT WE ARE
NIGHTS, WHERE THE OLD NIGHTS.
I'M A SOCIAL JUSTICE
MAGE, NOT A WORRIER.
WHAT ABOUT THAT, WHEN I HEAR
NIGHTS, IF KIM SAYS NIGHT,
I THINK OF AN OVERNIGHT FROM
WORLD OF WARCRAFT WHICH IS COOL.
WHEN RIGHT-WINGERS USE NIGHTS,
I THINK OF THE KKK AND I
THINK OF ALL OF THOSE OTHER
GROUPS THAT IF YOU'RE
TRYING TO AVOID NEGATIVE
CONNOTATIONS CALLING
YOURSELF A WHITE KNIGHT IS NOT
THE WAY YOU SHOULD DO IT.
BUT MAYBE THEY SEE THAT AS A
POSITIVE.
PROBABLY THEY DO.
THEY ARE LIKE OH, WE CAN
MOVE AWAY FROM THE ALL RIGHT
THING BUT ALSO SUBLIMINAL AND
ONLY ASSOCIATE US WITH THE
KKK ARE TRUE HEROES AT.
I THINK YOU ARE ON TO SOMETHING
THAT EITHER WAY, I THINK WE CAN
ALL ATTEST THAT WE HATE TROLLS
IN GENERAL BUT I DO LIKE THIS
SORT OF SCENARIO AND I LIKE
PUTTING IN THESE OTHER
IDEAS WHERE WE CAN SHOW THESE
PEOPLE'S TRUE COLOR.
DIDN'T EVEN LOOK UP WHO THE
PERSON WAS OR WHY THEY WERE
DEFENDING IT.
THEY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OTHER
CONFEDERATE THINGS.
THERE STANDING UP FOR
SLAVEOWNERS AND PEOPLE WHO
WANT TO CONTINUE SLAVERY.
AT WHAT POINT HISTORY ARE WE
GOING TO BE LIKE, THESE
PEOPLE GOING TO REALIZE THERE ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF A?
HAPPENS IS YOU RATIONALIZE IT
TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS NO
LONGER THE SAME THING SO YOU
WILL SAY IT IS NOT SLAVERY, IT
IS THIS OTHER THING THAT WAS NOT
AS BIG OF AN ISSUE AT THE TIME.
REALISTICALLY, IT HAS BEEN A
COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS.
THIS POINT PROBABLY NOT AT ALL.
THESE THINGS CAN GO AWAY AND
THEN COME BACK.
THE WHOLE CONFEDERATE BIKE
THING, THEY THINK THE
CONFEDERATE FLAG IS ALWAYS
BEEN IMPORTANT TO US BUT IT
WASN'T THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO
THEM DURING AND IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE CONFEDERACY AND THEN
IT WENT AWAY FOR DECADE
AFTER DECADE AND THEN THE CIVIL
RIGHTS MOVEMENT STARTED.
THEY STARTED TO FEEL SOMETHING
WAS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM
THEY LOOK FOR SYMBOLS AND I WAS
ONE OF THE ONES I FOUND THAT IT
WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR SCARED
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT
PROGRESS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
SOMETHING IN THE PAST THEY CAN
LOOK TO AND SAY THAT WAS WHEN
THINGS WERE GOING WELL, THAT IS
WHAT WE NEED TO GET BACK TO TODD
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
IS NEVER.
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET AWAY
FROM HER BASER INSTINCTS.
