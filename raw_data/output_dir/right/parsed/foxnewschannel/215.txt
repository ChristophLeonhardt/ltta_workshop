JESSE: REMEMBER THE HYSTERIA
ABOUT MELANIA TRUMP'S "I REALLY
DON'T CARE" JACKET IN THE
SUMMER?
NOT YOU MYSTERY BEHIND THE
JACKET IS SOLVED.
UNLESS TRUMP REVEALING HER
HIDDEN MESS IMAGINE HER FIRST
EXTENSIVE SIT-DOWN SINCE
BECOMING FIRST LADY.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JACKET.
WHY DID YOU WEAR IT?
>> I WORE THE JACKET TO GO ON
THE PLANE AND OFF THE PLANE, AND
IT WAS FOR THE PEOPLE OF AND FOR
THE LEFT-WING MEDIA WHO ARE
CRITICIZING ME, AND I WANT TO
SHOW THEM, I DON'T CARE.
YOU CAN CRITICIZE WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO SAY.
IT WILL NOT STOP ME TO DO WHAT I
FEEL IS RIGHT.
>> YOU WERE SENDING A MESSAGE
WHAT WITH THE JACKET.
>> IT WAS KINDS AFTER MESSAGE,
YES.
I WOULD PREFER THEY FOCUS ON
WHAT I DO AND MY INITIATIVE THAN
WHAT I WEAR.
JESSE: JOINING ME, DIAMOND AND
SILK.
IRONICALLY WE ARE FOCUSING ON
WHAT SHE IS TBHEARG PLAYING THE
SOUND
THUND
THE D
THE -- THE SOUND BITE.
>> I THINK SHE GAVE A GREAT
EXPLANATION AND SHE DID A
PHENOMENAL JOB IGNORING THE
BIASED INNUENDOS FROM THE
REPORTER.
THEY WERE TRYING TO GO OFF
SALACIOUS GOSSIP TO GET A
REACTION OUT OF HER.
THE LEFT-WING MEDIA TREAT HER
HORRIBLY, WHICH IS SO SAD.
I THINK THEY NEED TO GIVE HER
CREDIT AND START TREATING HER
LIKE OUR FIRST LADY.
WE LOVE HER.
AND THEY NEED TO TREAT HER WITH
THE UTMOST RESPECT.
JESSE: I DON'T WEAR ANYTHING
CONTROVERSIAL SO THEY CAN'T GO
AFTER ME.
SO KANYE WEST GOT POLITICAL AS
WE SAW.
TAYLOR SWIFT GOT PRETTY
POLITICAL ENDORSING A SENATE
CANDIDATE, DEMOCRAT IN
TENNESSEE, AND IT HAPPENED
WITHIN THE SAME WEEK.
BUT KANYE IS SAVAGELY ATTACKED,
AND TAYLOR SWIFT, PEOPLE SAY
THAT'S SO SWEET THAT SHE IS
GETTING INVOLVED IN THE
POLITICAL PROCESS.
SOMEWHAT THEY ARE DOING TO KANYE
IS THE WILLY LYNCH.
TH WE ARE NOT TELLING TO YOU
WALK AWAY.
I AM TELLING YOU TO RUN LIKE
H-E-L-L OFF THE DEMOCRATIC
PLANTATION.
JESSE: THIS HAS ME FIRED UP.
THIS IS JUST ASTOUNDING TO.
"WATTERS' WORLD."
THERE IS A POLL AND IT WAS DONE
BY A GROUPED CALLED I THINK IT
WAS MORE IN COMMON.
THIS IS WAIT SAID.
80% OF AMERICANS THINK POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS IS A PROBLEM THIS
COUNTRY.
BUT WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE
BREAKDOWN.
LOOK AT THE GROUPS WHO THINK
IT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS?
AMERICAN INDIANS ARE FED UP,
HISPANICS, ASIANS,
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
PRETTY MUCH' THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
HATES POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING WITH.
"WATTERS' WORLD."
GOING BACK TO THE STREETS WITH
WHAT I USED TO DO.
THIS MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM
DIFFERENT NOW.
>> LISTEN.
PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS THIS
COUNTRY.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA
AND UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOLS.
IF THEY DON'T STOP POLITICAL
DIRECTNESS, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE
THE SUICIDE OF AMERICA.
WE ARE GOING HAVE TO TELL THE
TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE NAKED
TRUTH WILL SET US ALL FREE.
JESSE: YOUR NEW MOVIE I HEAR IS
COMING OUT MONDAY.
THERE IT IS, DUMMYCRATS.
