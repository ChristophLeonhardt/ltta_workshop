1
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:03,837
THE POSITION THAT SOME SAY BOTH 

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:04,437
SIDES HAVE ALREADY MADE UP 

3
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,338
THEIR MINDS ABOUT. 

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,108
SO, THE PUBLIC MAY NEVER 

5
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,275
ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IS IN THE 

6
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:09,976
REPORT. 

7
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:14,514
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE REPORT 

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,050
WAS CONSTRAINED, THE FBI WAS 

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,818
CONSTRAINED IN WHO THEY COULD 

10
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,954
TALK TO AND HOW LONG THEY HAD 

11
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,455
TO CONDUCT THE INQUIRY. 

12
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,457
IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY AN 

13
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:24,824
INVESTIGATION. 

14
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:25,892
IT IS AN INQUIRY BECAUSE THEY 

15
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,527
HAD NO SUBPOENA POWER AND 

16
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,362
COULDN'T COMPEL ANYBODY TO TALK 

17
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,163
TO THEM. 

18
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,233
ALL THEY COULD DO WAS ASK 

19
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,701
QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE THAT MADE 

20
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,068
THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO THE FBI 

21
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:37,203
AND ASKED THEM QUESTIONS 

22
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,272
RELATED ONLY TO THE 

23
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:39,605
ACCUSATIONS. 

24
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:40,874
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND, IT WAS 

25
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,541
ACCUSATIONS OF DR. FORD AGAINST 

26
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,408
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

27
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,177
>> YOU DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY 

28
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,413
WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE TOLD THEM. 

29
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,947
IT WAS A LIMITATION AND WE KNOW 

30
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:56,756
THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK TO BLASEY 

31
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,391
FORD OR KAVANAUGH BUT THEY DID 

32
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,125
SPEAK TO A SECOND ACCUSER, 

33
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,360
DEBORAH RAMIREZ. 

34
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,863
SHE SAID SHE GAVE THEM A LIST OF

35
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,999
PEOPLE TO CORROBORATE HER 

36
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,401
STORY, WHICH IS THAT AT A PARTY 

37
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,603
AT YALE, BRETT KAVANAUGH EXPOSED

38
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,572
HIMSELF TO HER AND SHE SAID NO 

39
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,041
ONE ON HER LIST WAS CONTACTED 

40
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,842
BY THE FBI. 

41
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,911
LIKE I SAID EARLIER, WE KNOW 

42
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,845
THAT 10 PEOPLE WERE CONTACTED 

43
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,979
BY THE FBI AND THE INTERVIEWED 

44
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,150
NINE OF THEM. THIS WAS SUPPOSED 

45
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,985
TO BE THE WEEK TO DO THE 

46
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,720
INVESTIGATION AND IT HAS BEEN 

47
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,423
LESS THAN A WEEK, REALLY, JUST 

48
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,724
A FEW DAYS. 

49
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,992
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE FBI 

50
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,760
COULD REALLY DIG UP. 

51
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,395
SO, HERE WE ARE. 

52
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,798
THERE IS A BOAT PLANNED FOR 

53
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,200
TOMORROW. 

54
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,736
>> TO REITERATE A FINE POINT, 

55
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,905
WHICH IS THAT THE INVESTIGATION 

56
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,741
AND THE INQUIRY, AS I 

57
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,341
UNDERSTAND, WAS SPECIFICALLY 

58
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,578
AROUND THE ALLEGATIONS OF DR. 

59
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,779
FORD AND DEBORAH RAMIREZ, BUT 

60
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,316
YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME, 

61
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,585
WE HEARD FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

62
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,319
ROOMMATE AT YALE, JAMES ROCHE. 

63
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,588
HE CAME OUT ON RECORD WITH AN 

64
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,056
INTERVIEW WITH CNN AND SAID HE 

65
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,159
HAD KEPT HIS OWN COUNSEL OVER 

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,926
THE COURSE OF THE 

67
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,660
INVESTIGATIONS BUT FINALLY CAME 

68
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,264
FORWARD TO SAY THAT BRETT 

69
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,899
KAVANAUGH LIED UNDER OATH ABOUT 

70
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,234
THE DRINKING AND THE MEANING OF 

71
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,201
THE WORDS IN THE YEARBOOK AND 

72
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,906
THAT WAS NOT OF THE -- THAT WAS 

73
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:20,839
NOT PART OF THE PURVIEW. 

74
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,574
HERE IS SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER 

75
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,575
AND DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 

76
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,209
EXPECT THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER 

77
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,982
WILL MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT AND 

78
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,150
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY 

79
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,584
QUESTIONS. 

80
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,518
>> NOR AM I. 

81
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,586
>> AT 9:00 THIS MORNING, MY 

82
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,854
STAFF AND I REVIEWED THE FBI 

83
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,791
REPORT INTO SEXUAL ASSAULT 

84
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,792
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRETT 

85
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,092
KAVANAUGH. 

86
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:40,926
LET ME BE CLEAR. 

87
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,695
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE DETAIL 

88
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:47,133
BECAUSE THIS REMAINS A 

89
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,434
CONFIDENTIAL PART OF THE 

90
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:48,867
BACKGROUND REPORT. 

91
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:53,973
I HOPE THAT CHANGES ARE MADE 

92
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,308
AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALK 

93
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,743
MORE ABOUT WHAT THE FBI DID, 

94
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,878
LATER. 

95
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,148
WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE MOST 

96
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,217
NOTABLE PART OF THIS REPORT IS 

97
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:05,984
WHAT IS NOT IN IT. 

98
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,253
AS WE NOTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, 

99
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,890
THE FBI DID NOT INTERVIEW BRETT 

100
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,760
KAVANAUGH, NOR DID THE FBI 

101
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,394
INTERVIEW DR. BLASEY FORD. 

102
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:16,329
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS 

103
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,230
PEOPLE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS 

104
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,936
SEEKING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION 

105
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:28,241
TO THE FBI, WE HAVE SEEN EVEN 

106
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,343
MORE PRESS REPORTS OF WITNESSES 

107
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,046
WHO WANTED TO SPEAK WITH THE 

108
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,846
FBI BUT WERE NOT INTERVIEWED. 

109
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:34,480
DEBORAH RAMIREZ'S LAWYER SAID 

110
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,682
HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY 

111
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,919
CORROBORATING WITNESSES WHO 

112
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,319
WERE INTERVIEWED. 

113
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:40,920
CANDIDLY, WHAT WE REVIEWED 

114
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,622
TODAY IN A VERY LIMITED TIME, 

115
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,024
AND I WAS THERE AND HAD TO LEAVE

116
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:53,399
-- THE REPORT IS, IN PART, WITH 

117
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,135
THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ SOME, 

118
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,336
BUT NOT ALL OF IT. 

119
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:58,771
IT LOOKS TO BE A PRODUCT OF AN 

120
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,739
INCOMPLETE INVESTIGATION THAT 

121
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:06,312
WAS LIMITED PERHAPS, BY THE 

122
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,080
WHITE HOUSE. I 

123
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,948
DON'T KNOW. 

124
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,550
BUT, THE WHITE HOUSE CERTAINLY 

125
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,185
BLOCKED ACCESS TO MILLIONS OF 

126
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,287
DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S

127
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:14,921
RECORD. I 

128
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,221
KNOW THAT. 

129
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,356
THEY ENSURED THAT 90% OF HIS 

130
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,289
EMAILS AND MEMOS WEREN'T 

131
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:21,761
AVAILABLE FOR THE SENATE OR THE 

132
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,528
PUBLIC IN THE HEARINGS. 

133
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,830
IT NOW APPEARS THAT THEY ALSO 

134
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:31,170
BLOCKED THE FBI FROM DOING ITS 

135
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,537
JOB. 

136
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,139
DEMOCRATS AGREED THAT THE 

137
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,774
INVESTIGATION'S SCOPE SHOULD BE 

138
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,040
LIMITED. 

139
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,410
WE DID NOT AGREE THAT THE WHITE 

140
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,147
HOUSE SHOULD TIE THE HANDS OF 

141
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:41,414
THE FBI. 

142
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,317
IT'S SIMPLY NOT CREDIBLE TO SAY 

143
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,385
THAT PUBLIC TESTIMONY IN LAST 

144
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,319
WEEK'S HEARING IS A SUBSTITUTE 

145
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,356
FOR INTERVIWS BY FBI AGENTS. 

146
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,691
NOT ONLY DO SENATORS LACK THE 

147
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,625
EXPERTISE OF FBI AGENTS, WE 

148
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:58,865
WERE ONLY GIVEN FIVE MINUTES TO 

149
00:04:58,865 --> 00:04:59,432
QUESTION JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

150
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,266
SO, IN MY VIEW, FROM WHAT I 

151
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,902
SAW, THE INVESTIGATION WAS VERY 

152
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,936
LIMITED AND IT WILL BE 

153
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,473
INTERESTING, AFTER ALL OF THE 

154
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:12,512
MEMBERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, 

155
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,980
THAT AFTER THEY READ THE 

156
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,914
DOCUMENTS, WE WOULD HAVE AN 

157
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:15,548
OPPORTUNITY IN PUBLIC TO 

158
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:20,553
DISCUSS OUR CONCLUSIONS WITH 

159
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:20,886
THE FINDINGS. 

160
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:21,721
>> THANK YOU SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 

161
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,290
I HAVE THREE POINTS TO MAKE. 

162
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,593
ONE, WE HAD MANY FEARS THAT 

163
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,730
THIS WAS A VERY LIMITED PROCESS 

164
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,931
THAT WOULD CONSTRAIN THE FBI 

165
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:41,040
FROM GETTING ALL THE FACTS. 

166
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,741
HAVING RECEIVED A THOROUGH 

167
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,642
úBRI 

168
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,976
THOSE FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED. 

169
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:52,752
SECOND, I DISAGREE. HAVING 

170
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,886
RECEIVED A BRIEFING ON ALL OF 

171
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,121
THE DOCUMENTS, I DISAGREE WITH 

172
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:55,721
SENATOR GRASSLEY'S STATEMENT 

173
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,222
THAT THERE WAS NO HINT OF 

174
00:05:57,222 --> 00:06:00,326
MISCONDUCT. 

175
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,160
THIRD, WE ARE REITERATING OUR 

176
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,834
CALL, GIVEN HOW LIMITED THIS 

177
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,301
SCOPE WAS, THE LIMITED SCOPE OF 

178
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,503
THE INVESTIGATION, WE ARE 

179
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:16,242
REITERATING OUR CALL THAT THE 

180
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:16,975
DOCUMENTS WITH PROPER REDACTION 

181
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:17,576
BE MADE PUBLIC. 

182
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:18,177
WHY SHOULDN'T ALL OF AMERICA 

183
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,881
SEE THE FACTS? 

184
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,115
SECOND, WE ARE REITERATING OUR 

185
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:26,819
CALL TO MAKE THE DIRECTIVE THAT 

186
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,554
THE WHITE HOUSE AND COUNSEL

CONSTRAINED THE INVESTIGATION 

190
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,436
FROM THE GET-GO. 

191
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:45,438
THE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE

00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,205
DOCUMENT AND THEREFORE 100 

193
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:51,210
SENATORS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,445
CONSTRAINING THE ABILITY OF ALL 

195
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,348
SENATORS AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

196
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,382
TO SEE THE WHOLE TRUTH AND 

197
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,216
NOTHING BUT. 

198
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:02,054
THANK YOU. 

199
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,289
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU 

200
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,423
DISAGREED WITH SENATOR GRASSLEY 

201
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:10,963
STATEMENT, SENATOR? 

202
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:17,169
>>> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE 

203
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,204
DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP INCLUDING 

204
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:18,838
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN, THE 

205
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,739
RANKING MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY 

206
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,875
COMMITTEE AND CHUCK SCHUMER, 

207
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,678
THE RANKING MINORITY LEADER AND 

208
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,312
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS HERE AT 

209
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,013
HE TABLE WITH US. 

210
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,182
IT'S WHAT WE EXPECTED, I THINK. 

211
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,016
WE EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD 

212
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:36,322
NOT BE ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW 

213
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,391
THE DOCUMENTS AND THAT IS WHAT 

214
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,693
SENATOR FEINSTEIN SAID AND WHAT 

215
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,928
WE HEARD FROM CHUCK SCHUMER IS 

216
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,595
THAT HE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREES 

217
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,362
WITH THE STATEMENT THAT SENATOR 

218
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:47,633
GRASSLEY PUTOUT THAT SAYS THAT 

219
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,501
-- SORRY, THESE UNCORROBORATED 

220
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:55,308
ACCUSATIONS HAVE BEEN 

221
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,209
UNEQUIVOCALLY AND REPEATEDLY 

222
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,376
REJECTED BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

223
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,211
IT SAYS THAT NEITHER THE 

224
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,245
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOR THE FBI 

225
00:07:59,245 --> 00:07:59,879
COULD LOCATE ANY THIRD PARTIES 

226
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,218
WHO CAN ATTEST TO ANY OF THESE 

227
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:06,551
ALLEGATIONS. 

228
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:07,753
>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT 

229
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,389
NANCY CORDES WAS IN THE ROOM 

230
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,892
AND WE WILL TALK TO HER LATER. 

231
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:13,559
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING, THEY 

232
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,727
CAN'T SHARE THE DETAILS OF THIS 

233
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,461
CONFIDENTIAL INQUIRY BUT THAT 

234
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,565
IS THE ONLY HINT THAT CHUCK 

235
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,666
SCHUMER SAYS -- AT LEAST WHAT 

236
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:26,172
HE IS SAYING TO THE PUBLIC -- 

237
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:26,939
IS THAT WHAT SENATOR GRASSLEY 

238
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,873
SAYS IS PERHAPS NOT EVERYTHING 

239
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,141
THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW. 

240
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:35,280
>> WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND 

241
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,616
CONSIDER HOW REMARKABLE THIS 

242
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:37,783
IS. 

243
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,784
IT'S A SENATE JUDICIARY 

244
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,385
COMMITTEE, A TRADITIONAL 

245
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,087
BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE AND THE 

246
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,421
WAY THEY BEEN OPERATING IN TWO 

247
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,056
LANES IS REMARKABLE GIVEN THE 

248
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,191
SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THEY ARE 

249
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:45,591
DEALING WITH. 

250
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,627
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LIFETIME 

251
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,362
APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT

252
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,430
AND WE WILL SEE THIS ALL DAY 

253
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,798
WITH REPUBLICANS COMING OUT AND 

254
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,433
SAYING ONE THING AND DEMOCRATS 

255
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,367
SAYING ANOTHER. 

256
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,337
RIGHT NOW, WE JUST HEARD THAT 

257
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,339
THE DEMOCRATS ARE VERY 

258
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,240
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCHOOL. 

259
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,907
>> LEADER McCONNELL IS 

260
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:02,174
SPEAKING. 

261
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:02,507
LET'S LISTEN. 

262
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,275
>> WE DEMONSTRATE THE CAPACITY 

263
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:07,279
FOR SOUND JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT. 

264
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,085
THIS IS A NONPARTISAN TEST THAT 

265
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:13,953
MY FRIEND, THE DEMOCRATIC 

266
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:14,553
LEADER, AND OTHERS, USED TO 

267
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,423
CALL THE GOLD STANDARD. JUDGE 

268
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:22,995
KAVANAUGH PAST THAT WITH FLYING 

269
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:23,529
COLORS. 

270
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:29,768
TO BE CLEAR, THIS SEAL OF 

271
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,470
APPROVAL COMES FROM THE ADA 

272
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,204
STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE 

273
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:32,938
FEDERAL JUDICIARY WITH THE 

274
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,140
INDEPENDENT ENTITY WITHIN THE 

275
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,874
ORGANIZATION. 

276
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,945
EVEN AFTER THE PRESIDENT TRIED 

277
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:40,880
TO PLAY POLITICS WITH THE 

278
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,513
NOMINATION LAST WEEK, THE 

279
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:42,415
STANDING COMMITTEE REAFFIRMED 

280
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,416
ITS RATING YET AGAIN. 

281
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,754
UNANIMOUSLY QUALIFIED, JUDGE 

282
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,758
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

283
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,293
HOW DID WE END UP WHERE WE ARE 

284
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:54,526
TODAY? 

285
00:09:54,526 --> 00:10:02,101
HOW DID WE GET HERE? 

286
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,269
WE HAVE A CHORUS OF EXPERT 

287
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,869
PRAISE AND PROFESSIONAL 

288
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,437
RESPECT, HOW DID WE GET TO WILD 

289
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:10,776
TALES OF VIOLENT GANGS, SEXUAL 

290
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,679
ASSAULT. 

291
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,547
BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND HARBORS 

292
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,414
AND THE POSSIBILITY, GET THIS, 

293
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,815
OF AN ARGUMENT IN A COLLEGE 

294
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,751
BAR? 

295
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:26,559
AN ARGUMENT IN A COLLEGE BAR? 

296
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,293
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, A 

297
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,160
CONFIDENTIAL ALLEGATION OF 

298
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,300
MISCONDUCT FROM NEARLY FOUR 

299
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,468
YEARS AGO WAS LEAKED TO THE 

300
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:35,701
PRESS. 

301
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,302
SINCE THEN, OTHER ALLEGATIONS 

302
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,572
HAVE POURED FORTH AND MANY WERE 

303
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,940
JUST PATENTLY RIDICULOUS. 

304
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,710
A FEEDING FRENZY OF RIDICULOUS 

305
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:54,019
ACCUSATIONS. 

306
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:54,987
SOME CHEERED ON THE FEEDING 

307
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,921
FRENZY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSE 

308
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:56,689
LIST -- PURPOSES BUT CHUCK 

309
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,389
GRASSLEY AND HIS STAFF ROLLED 

310
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,690
UP THEIR SLEEVES AND WENT TO 

311
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,293
WORK. 

312
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,397
THEY PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED THE 

313
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:14,340
ALLEGATIONS THAT MATERIALIZED 

314
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,440
AT THE LAST MINUTE. 

315
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,909
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY REOPENED THE 

316
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:17,943
PUBLIC HEARINGS SO DR. FORD AND 

317
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:18,778
JUDGE KAVANAUGH COULD SPEAK 

318
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,879
DIRECTLY TO THOSE CLAIMS UNDER 

319
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,182
OATH OATH. 

320
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,819
THAT WAS AFTER, BY THE WAY, HE 

321
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,654
OFFERED DR. FOR THE OPTION TO 

322
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,989
TELL HER STORY AT ANY PLACE OF 

323
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,223
HER CHOOSING EITHER HERE OR IN 

324
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,491
CALIFORNIA, EITHER IN PUBLIC OR 

325
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:38,097
IN PRIVATE AND EITHER WITH 

326
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,665
STAFF OR WITH MEMBERS AND ALL 

327
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,167
ACCORDING TO DR. FORD'S 

328
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:46,739
TESTIMONY, SEEMINGLY NEVER 

329
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,541
COMMUNICATED TO HER BY HER 

330
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,008
LAWYERS, DESPITE THE 

331
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:55,481
PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENT. 

332
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,081
THE FBI COMPLETED A 

333
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,016
SUPPLEMENTAL BACKGROUND 

334
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,184
INVESTIGATION AND DELIVER THE 

335
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:04,890
RESULTS IN THE SENATE. 

336
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,025
MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS NOW THE 

337
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,560
SEVENTH TIME THE FBI HAS 

338
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,496
THOROUGHLY REVIEWED JUDGE 

339
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,900
KAVANAUGH'S BACKGROUND. 

340
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,001
SEVEN FBI INVESTIGATIONS. 

341
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,573
WHAT DID WE LEARN? 

342
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,109
WHAT DO THE FACTS AND EVIDENCE 

343
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,310
TELL US AFTER SEVEN FBI 

344
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,914
INVESTIGATIONS? 

345
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,882
THE FACT IS THAT THESE 

346
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:30,916
ALLEGATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN 

347
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,619
CORROBORATED. NONE OF THE 

348
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,086
ALLEGATIONS HAD BEEN 

349
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:39,959
CORROBORATED BY THE SEVENTH FBI 

350
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,326
INVESTIGATION. 

351
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,360
NOT IN THE NEW FBI AND NOT 

352
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:53,806
ANYWHERE. 

353
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,473
NONE OF THESE FBI 

354
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,040
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN 

355
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,878
CORROBORATED AS AFFIRMED BY THE 

356
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:03,382
SEVENTH AND LATEST FBI 

357
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:03,749
INVESTIGATION. 

358
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,349
AS CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY STATED 

359
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:04,916
THIS MORNING, NEITHER THE 

360
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,585
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOR THE FBI 

361
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,820
COULD LOCATE ANY THIRD PARTIES 

362
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,391
WHO CAN ATTEST TO ANY OF THESE 

363
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,561
ALLEGATIONS. 

364
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:23,669
NO BACKUP FROM ANY WITNESSES, 

365
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,303
INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFICALLY 

366
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,537
NAMED AS EYE WITNESSES BY THE 

367
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:26,105
PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THE 

368
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,375
ALLEGATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

369
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,208
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. 

370
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,443
NO BACKUP FROM ANY WITNESSES, 

371
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,180
INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFICALLY 

372
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,314
NAMED AS EYE WITNESSES BY THE 

373
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:38,517
PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THESE 

374
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:42,288
ALLEGATIONS. 

375
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,691
IN ADDITION, ONE PERSON HAS 

376
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:50,796
COMPLETELY RECANTED THEIR HOLE 

377
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:56,402
WILD STORY. ANOTHER ACCUSER 

378
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,469
WENT ON TELEVISION AND 

379
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,371
BACKPEDALED FOR MANY OF THE 

380
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,909
RIDICULOUS CHARGES. 

381
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,044
THE FACTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE 

382
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,278
ALLEGATIONS LEVIED AT JUDGE 

383
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,517
KAVANAUGH'S CHARACTER. 

384
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,785
INSTEAD, MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY 

385
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,318
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

386
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:20,592
STRONG, UNEQUIVOCAL DENIAL. 

387
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:21,427
HE REPEATEDLY STATED TO 

388
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,227
INVESTIGATORS, UNDER PENALTY OF 

389
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:26,599
FELONY FOR THIS. 

390
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:32,871
HE FIRMLY RESTATED UNDER OATH 

391
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,205
LAST THURSDAY FOR THE AMERICAN 

392
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:40,112
PEOPLE. 

393
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:40,879
THIS ALIGNS WITH THE TESTIMONY 

394
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,613
OF HUNDREDS, LITERALLY HUNDREDS 

395
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,082
OF CHARACTER WITNESSES WHO'VE 

396
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:51,156
KNOWN HIM OVER THE YEARS. 

397
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,193
FOR GOODNESS SAKE'S, THIS IS 

398
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,059
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

399
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,028
NOBODY IS SUPPOSED TO BE GUILTY 

400
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:56,829
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT IN THIS 

401
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,596
COUNTRY. 

402
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,566
NOBODY IS SUPPOSED TO BE GUILTY 

403
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,902
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT IN THE 

404
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:08,474
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

405
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:13,545
THE SENATE SHOULD NOT SET A 

406
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,479
FUNDAMENTALLY UN-AMERICAN 

407
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:24,690
PRECEDENT HERE. JUDGE 

408
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,257
KAVANAUGH'S RIGHT TO BASIC 

409
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:25,890
FAIRNESS DOES NOT DISAPPEAR 

410
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,593
JUST BECAUSE SOME DISAGREE WITH 

411
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:36,168
THE JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY. 

412
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,405
OUR SOCIETY IS NOT A PLACE 

413
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,272
WHERE UNCORROBORATED 

414
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,341
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT FROM 

415
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,809
NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO, ALLEGATIONS

416
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,144
VIGOROUSLY DISPUTED, CAN 

417
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,111
NULLIFY THE CAREER OR DESTROY 

418
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,511
THEIR REPUTATION. 

419
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,346
IS THAT WHAT THE SENATE WOULD 

420
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,216
BE KNOWN FOR? 

421
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,184
THE NOMINATION COMES HERE AND 

422
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:58,791
WE DESTROY YOUR REPUTATION? 

423
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,726
THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE IS GOING 

424
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:05,531
TO PARTICIPATE IN? 

425
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,732
ABOVE THE PARTISAN NOISE AND 

426
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:11,503
BEYOND THIS SHAMEFUL SPECTACLE, 

427
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,238
WHICH IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE

428
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,707
SENATE, WHAT WILL ENDURE ARE 

429
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:21,080
THE ACTUAL FACTS BEFORE US. 

430
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,952
THE ACTUAL FACTS. UPON 

431
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:27,820
REVIEWING THEM, ONLY ONE 

432
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,354
QUESTION IS LEFT FOR US TO 

433
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:33,158
ANSWER. 

434
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,126
IS JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH 

435
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,094
QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON THE 

436
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,697
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT? 

437
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,832
WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, THERE'S A 

438
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,999
GOOD REASON THE POLITICAL 

439
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:41,934
OPPONENTS WOULDN'T WANT TO 

440
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,870
LITIGATE THAT ISSUE. 

441
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,041
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. 

442
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,376
THERE'S A GOOD REASON WHY THEY 

443
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,142
LET THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL 

444
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:54,947
DESTRUCTION RUN AWAY AHEAD OF 

445
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,681
THE FACTS. 

446
00:16:56,681 --> 00:17:01,220
IN AN EFFORT TO DODGE THAT VERY 

447
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,521
GOOD QUESTION, BECAUSE BRETT 

448
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,621
KAVANAUGH IS STUNNINGLY AND 

449
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:16,034
TOTALLY QUALIFIED FOR THIS JOB. 

450
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:16,835
WE ALREADY KNOW THIS. 

451
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,836
FOR STARTERS, HIS ACADEMIC AND 

452
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,936
LEGAL CREDENTIALS ARE SECOND TO 

453
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:20,239
NONE. 

454
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:27,679
FROM YALE WITH HONORS AND ONTO 

455
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,880
YALE LAW SCHOOL AND THEN CAME 

456
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,182
ú 

457
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,416
CLERKSHIPS IN THE NATION'S 

458
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,552
FEDERAL COURTS, ENDING UP WITH 

459
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:40,893
JUSTICE KENNEDY. HIS CAREER 

460
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,894
CONTINUED WITH WORK IN THE 

461
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,728
OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 

462
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,896
AND THE OFFICE OF WHITE HOUSE 

463
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,799
COUNSEL AND THAT WAS ONLY THE 

464
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,102
BEGINNING. 

465
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,004
FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS, BRETT 

466
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,338
KAVANAUGH HAS SERVED ON WHAT IS 

467
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,173
WIDELY CONSIDERED THE SECOND 

468
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,374
HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND, THE 

469
00:17:55,374 --> 00:18:00,846
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS 

470
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,014
WRITTEN MORE THAN 300 JUDICIAL 

471
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:05,284
OPINIONS, SEVERAL ON THE BASIS 

472
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,885
OF LATER RULINGS BY THE SUPREME 

473
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:07,252
COURT, ITSELF. 

474
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,020
THE LITANY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

475
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,254
IS A FACT, A FACT. 

476
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:16,662
A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD. 

477
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:21,200
ALL THE ACCOUNTS OF JUDGE BRETT 

478
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,100
KAVANAUGH, THE PERSON, THEY 

479
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,202
HAVE BEEN VOLUNTEERED BY THOSE 

480
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,269
WHO HAVE KNOWN HIM EVERY STEP 

481
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,906
OF THE WAY OVER THE YEARS. 

482
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:31,844
WE'VE HEARD FROM LITERALLY 

483
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,544
HUNDREDS OF CHARACTER WITNESSES 

484
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:41,220
WHO HAVE HEAPED PRAISE ON THE 

485
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,388
BRETT KAVANAUGH THEY KNOW, THE 

486
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,557
LOYAL FRIEND AND TEAMMATE, THE 

487
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,392
STANDOUT STUDENT AND THE 

488
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,195
TALENTED HARD-WORKING COLLIE, 

489
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,631

RESPECTD ROLE MODEL AND 

491
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,566
MENTOR, PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN. 

492
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,934
THE DEVOTED HUSBAND, FATHER AND 

493
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,570
COACH. 

494
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,404
THESE LETTERS AND RECORDED 

495
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,606
TESTIMONY WERE OFFERED BY MEN 

496
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,174
AND WOMEN WITH NOTHING TO GAIN 

497
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,875
FOR THEMSELVES. THEY WERE JUST 

498
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,879
GLAD TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT A 

499
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:08,513
NOMINEE THAT THEY KNOW 

500
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:09,013
POSSESSES THE CHARACTER 

501
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:12,550
TEMPERAMENT AND QUALIFICATIONS 

502
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:19,925
FOR THIS IMPORTANT JOB. 

503
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,261
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S PROFESSORS AND

504
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,929
OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM AT YALE 

505
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,063
DESCRIBE A TRUE INTELLECTUAL, A 

506
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:25,897
LEADING THINKER, A WONDERFUL 

507
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:32,838
MENTOR AND LEADER AND ONE WENT 

508
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,640
SO FAR AS TO SAY IT'S HARD TO 

509
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,474
NAME ANYONE WITH JUDICIAL 

510
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,541
CREDENTIALS AS STRONG AS THOSE 

511
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,312
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

512
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:46,117
HIS FORMER LAW CLERKS AND 

513
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,385
úOTHE 

514
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:56,495
HUMILITY. THEY SAY HE GIVES 

515
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,329
UNFLINCHING AND HONEST ADVICE 

516
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,497
AND LISTENS CAREFULLY TO THE 

517
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,464
VIEWS OF HIS COLLEAGUES AND 

518
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,599
CLERKS EVEN WHEN THEY DIFFER 

519
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:15,514
FROM HIS OWN. 

520
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,014
IN WASHINGTON, FOR THE 

521
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:16,581
POLITICAL PERSUASIONS, THEY 

522
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:17,716
HAVEN'T MINCED THEIR WORDS AND 

523
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,120
GAVE HIM UNQUESTIONINGLY 

524
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,854
QUALIFIED BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY 

525
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:28,359
INTELLECT AND TEMPERAMENT AND 

526
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,363
WARNED THE SENATE NOT TO MISS 

527
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,397
THE OPPORTUNITY TO, QUOTE, PUT 

528
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,565
SUCH A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR 

529
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,298
DECENCY AND CIVILITY ON OUR 

530
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:42,641
NATION'S HIGHEST COURT. 

531
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,942
MR. PRESIDENT, LET'S NOT LOSE 

532
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:44,976
SIGHT OF THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE 

533
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:46,778
US. 

534
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,246
THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN RULED BY 

535
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:53,184
FEAR AND ANGER AND UNDERHANDED 

536
00:20:53,184 --> 00:21:00,859
GAMESMANSHIP FOR TOO LONG. 

537
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,794
IT'S TIME TO STAND UP FOR THIS 

538
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,462
KIND OF THING. 

539
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,730
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN 

540
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,533
PEOPLE NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY 

541
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,667
THESE TACTICS. 

542
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,770
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN 

543
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,537
PEOPLE TO UNDERSCORE THAT YOU 

544
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,671
ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN 

545
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:17,008
GUILTY. 

546
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:17,809
IT'S THE SENATE ON TRIAL HERE, 

547
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,243
MR. PRESIDENT. 

548
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,311
WHAT KIND OF IMAGE WILL BE 

549
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,046
CONVEY TO THE PUBLIC? 

550
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:25,751
CAN WE BE SCARED BY ALL THESE 

551
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,851
PEOPLE RAMPAGING THROUGH THE 

552
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,855
HALLS ACCOSTING MEMBERS AT 

553
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:30,922
AIRPORTS AND COMING TO THEIR 

554
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,558
HOMES? 

555
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,396
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THE SENATE 

556
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,331
INTO DEFEATING A GOOD MAN? 

557
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:44,236
WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW THIS TO 

558
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:44,703
HAPPEN. 

559
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:53,111
IN THIS COUNTRY? 

560
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,182
SO, WE WILL NOT PRETEND THAT 

561
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,217
PARTISAN HISTRIONICS WOULD TAKE 

562
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,053
AWAY THE BASIC FAIRNESS THAT 

563
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:03,955
EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES. 

564
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:08,026
WE WILL NOT BE HOODWINKED BY 

565
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,262
THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED HARD TO 

566
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,364
SMEAR THIS GOOD MAN AND DRAG 

567
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:19,504
HIM THROUGH THE MUD. WHEN THAT 

568
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:26,344
DIDN'T WORK, THEY TURNED ON A 

569
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,011
DIME AND STARTED CLAIMING HIS 

570
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,213
REAL SIN WAS THAT HE SPOKE OF 

571
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,949
TOO FORCEFULLY IN DEFENSE OF 

572
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:35,587
HIS GOOD NAME AND HIS FAMILY. 

573
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,255
THEY DECIDED HE DIDN'T HAVE A 

574
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,426
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT BECAUSE HE 

575
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,327
AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDED HIS GOOD 

576
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:42,527
NAME. 

577
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,063
IT WAS AGAINST THIS OUTRAGEOUS 

578
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:49,200
SMEAR CONDUCTED IN CONJUNCTION 

579
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,704
WITH SENATE DEMOCRATS. 

580
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,007
WHO AMONG US WOULD NOT HAVE 

581
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,411
BEEN OUTRAGED BY HAVING A 

582
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,447
LIFETIME RECORD DRUG THROUGH 

583
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:07,685
THE MUD WITH ACCUSATIONS THAT 

584
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:10,755
CANNOT BE PROVEN? 

585
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:13,492
AND A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO DECIDE 

586
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,294
ON THE PART OF SOME DEMOCRATS 

587
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,261
THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF 

588
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:21,967
INNOCENCE NO LONGER APPLIES IN 

589
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:22,334
THIS COUNTRY. 

590
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,902
WHAT KIND OF PERSON COULDN'T 

591
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:32,644
HAVE BEEN UPSET ABOUT THAT? 

592
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,712
THEY CLAIM HE SPOKE TOO 

593
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,779
FORCEFULLY IN DEFENSE OF 

594
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:35,046
HIMSELF? 

595
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:40,285
AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF SUCH 

596
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,419
OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR THAT CANNOT 

597
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:46,658
BE PROVEN? 

598
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,993
I ADMIRE HIM FOR STANDING UP 

599
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,427
FOR HIMSELF AND STANDING UP FOR 

600
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,228
HIS FAMILY. 

601
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,731
I'D BE SHOCKED IF IT WERE NOT 

602
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:57,636
DONE IN AN AGGRESSIVE FASHION. 

603
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,406
FOR GOODNESS SAKE. 

604
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,774
SO, LET'S RECLAIM THIS MOMENT 

605
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,545
FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE, A CHANCE 

606
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:12,183
TO ELEVATE A STUNNINGLY TALENTED

607
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:13,385
AND IMPRESSIVE JURIST IN AN 

608
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,219
IMPORTANT OFFICE FOR WHICH HE 

609
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,588
IS SO WELL-QUALIFIED. 

610
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,822
SO COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY 

611
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:25,297
QUALIFIED. 

612
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,898
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE 

613
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,966
OUR GREAT NATION PRECISELY THE 

614
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,800
KIND OF BRILLIANT, FAIR-MINDED 

615
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,667
AND COLLEGIAL SUPREME COURT 

616
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,802
JUSTICE THAT THE COURT 

617
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,604
DESERVES. 

618
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,507
THIS, MR. PRESIDENT, IS THE GOOD

619
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,607
THAT SENATORS WILL HAVE AN 

620
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:41,179
OPPORTUNITY TO DO. 

621
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,814
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO GOOD 

622
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,485
HERE. 

623
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,419
AND, TO UNDERSCORE THE BASIC 

624
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,154
TENANT OF FAIRNESS IN OUR 

625
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:55,026
COUNTRY. 

626
00:24:55,026 --> 00:25:00,398
SO, YESTERDAY EVENING, I FOUND 

627
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,866
CLOSURE ON THE NOMINATION AND I 

628
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:02,900
WILL BE PROUD TO VOTE TO 

629
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:15,947
ADVANCES NOMINATION TOMORROW. 

630
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:20,051
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

631
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,352
THE MAJORITY LEADER IN THE 

632
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:28,793
SENATE TALKING AND WE'VE HEARD 

633
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,727
PREVIOUSLY FROM CHUCK GRASSLEY 

634
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,496
AND FROM THE DEMOCRATS, THE 

635
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,964
REACTION TO THE FBI EXPANDED 

636
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:33,932
INVESTIGATION AND NANCY CORDES 

637
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,434
WAS IN THE ROOM AT THE TIME. 

638
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,770
NANCY, YOU ARE JOINING US FROM 

639
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,103
CAPITOL HILL. 

640
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,438
WE ARE HEARING ARGUMENTS WE 

641
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,406
EXPECT IT FROM BOTH SIDES OF 

642
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,074
THE AISLE IN REGARDS TO THIS 

643
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:46,745
FBI DOCUMENT AND WHETHER IT 

644
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,445
SHEDS LIGHT OR WHETHER IT 

645
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:47,712
DOESN'T. 

646
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,913
JUST REMIND US WHAT WE HEARD 

647
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:54,185
FROM CHUCK SCHUMER MOMENTS AGO. 

648
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,287
>> Reporter: IT WAS INTERESTING 

649
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,289
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T TAKE ANY 

650
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,091
QUESTIONS FROM US BUT WAS 

651
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:00,959
TANTALIZINGLY SAYING THAT 

652
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,461
WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS, 

653
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,796
DEMOCRATS DON'T AGREE WITH THE 

654
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,197
CONCLUSION BY THE WHITE HOUSE 

655
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,365
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY, THE CHAIR 

656
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,066
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

657
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:11,269
COMMITTEE, THAT THERE IS 

658
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,570
ESSENTIALLY NOTHING TO SEE IN 

659
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,905
THE REPORT AND NOTHING IN THERE 

660
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,240
TO CORROBORATE CHRISTINE BLASEY 

661
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,577
FORD'S CLAIMS. 

662
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,944
LEADER SCHUMER SAID WE DISAGREE 

663
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:20,946
WITH SENATOR GRASSLEY STATEMENT 

664
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,113
THAT THERE IS NO HINT OF 

665
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:27,652
MISCONDUCT IN THIS FBI REPORT. 

666
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,521
NOW, THE CHALLENGE IS THAT 

667
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,788
BECAUSE THE SENATORS ARE 

668
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:31,990
PROHIBITED FROM SPEAKING 

669
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,691
PUBLICLY ABOUT WHAT IS 

670
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,992
CONTAINED IN THE FBI REPORT, WE 

671
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,160
REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS 

672
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,264
REFERRING TO AND IT'S DIFFICULT 

673
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,533
TO JUDGE WHAT HE IS SAYING AND 

674
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,901
WHAT GRASSLEY IS SAYING ABOUT 

675
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,235
THE CONCLUSIONS THAT ONE WOULD 

676
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,136
REACH IF THEY WERE ABLE TO READ 

677
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,771
THIS FBI REPORT. 

678
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:51,309
IT'S SORT OF UNDER LOCK AND KEY 

679
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,644
RIGHT NOW IN A ROOM IN THE 

680
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,378
CAPITAL BASEMENT WHERE SENATORS 

681
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,446
CAN ONLY FILE IN AND GET A 

682
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,716
BRIEFING FROM CERTAIN APPROVED 

683
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:57,983
STAFFERS. 

684
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,284
THEY ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE 

685
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,218
DOCUMENT BUT THEY CAN'T TAKE IT 

686
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:05,123
FROM THE ROOM. 

687
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,592
ALL OF THIS IS BEING DONE TO 

688
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,360
MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE 

689
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,730
ACCESS TO IT AND WE AREN'T ABLE 

690
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,866
TO SEE CERTAIN DETAILS FROM 

691
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,001
THAT REPORT AND NOT OTHERS. 

692
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,203
IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO 

693
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,506
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FBI DID 

694
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,742
FIND IN THOSE 10 OR SO 

695
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,809
INTERVIEWS AGENTS COULD 

696
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,076
CONDUCT. 

697
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,345
>> NANCY, I WILL POINT OUT THAT 

698
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,079
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS WITH US 

699
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,813
AT THE TABLE. 

700
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:33,350
REPORTERS HAVE BEEN STAKING OUT 

701
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,420
SENATORS AND AS ANNE-MARIE 

702
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,755
POINTED OUT, WE HEARD FROM THE 

703
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,689
MAJORITY LEADER AND THE 

704
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,057
MINORITY LEADER BUT WHAT PEOPLE 

705
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:46,865
WANT TO HEAR FROM IS THE THREE 

706
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,032
KEY SENATORS, SUSAN COLLINS, 

707
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:50,335
JEFF FLAKE AND LISA MURKOWSKI 

708
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,803
AND MAYBE FOLKS LIKE JOE 

709
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,070
MANCHIN. 

710
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,371
WHAT HAVE WE HEARD, IF 

711
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,172
ANYTHING, FROM THOSE SENATORS 

712
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,108
AS TO WHAT THEY'VE SEEN AND 

713
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,677
WHAT THEY'VE READ IN THE REPORT 

714
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,910
AND HOW THEY FEEL NOW THAT THE 

715
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,145
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE? 

716
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,147
>> Reporter: WE'VE HEARD 

717
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:02,547
EXACTLY NOTHING. 

718
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,616
WE DID SEE SENATOR COLLINS GO 

719
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:09,920
INTO THE ROOM AND WHERE THE FBI 

720
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,289
REPORT IS BEING HELD. 

721
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,526
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM 

722
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,726
HER OR OTHER SENATORS YOU 

723
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:17,162
MENTIONED SINCE THEN. 

724
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,796
THE REALITY IS THAT EVERY 

725
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:19,798
INTEREST IS GOING TO MAKE IT 

726
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,333
APPEAR THAT THEY ARE MAKING A 

727
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,702
VERY REASONED DECISION BASED ON 

728
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,172
WHAT THEY VIEW IN THE REPORT. 

729
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,473
IT DOESN'T BEHOOVE THEM TO WALK 

730
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,976
RIGHT OUT AND MAKE A STATEMENT 

731
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,478
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ABOUT 

732
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,345
WHETHER THEY THINK THE FBI 

733
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,180
INFORMATION IS COMPELLING OR 

734
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,681
WHETHER THEY ARE MOVED BY IT 

735
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,616
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. 

736
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,119
THEY HAVE BASICALLY HELD OUT 

737
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,821
THIS LONG DESPITE THE REPEATED 

738
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,355
QUESTIONS FOR THEM ABOUT WHERE 

739
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,456
THEY STAND. 

740
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:46,624
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY 

741
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:47,892
PROBABLY WILL HOLD ON AT LEAST 

742
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,561
A DAY LONGER UNTIL THE SENATE 

743
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,164
IS SET TO TAKE THE PROCEDURAL 

744
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,233
VOTE THAT YOU JUST HEARD THE 

745
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,100
REPUBLICAN LEADER, MITCH 

746
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,202
McCONNELL, TALK ABOUT ON THE 

747
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,269
SENATE FLOOR, SETTING UP A 

748
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,303
FINAL CONFIRMATION VOTE ON 

749
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:02,841
SATURDAY. 

750
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,943
>> NANCY, YOU KNOW THE CONGRESS 

751
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,811
BETTER THAN ANYBODY. 

752
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,780
I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE MAKING OF 

753
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,881
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR MITCH 

754
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,181
McCONNELL? 

755
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:10,882
IT'S BEEN FASCINATING TO WATCH 

756
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:11,983
HIM ON THE SENATE FLOOR USING 

757
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,017
SOME PRETTY PASSIONATE 

758
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,521
RHETORIC. 

759
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,091
>> ACTUALLY, THE SHOT YOU SAW, 

760
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,160
IT WENT DOWN FOR A SHOT OF THE 

761
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,560
CAPITOL BUILDING. 

762
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,696
WE JUST LOST HER. 

763
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,264
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

764
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,832
HOW ACTIVE THIS WAS AND HOW 

765
00:29:28,832 --> 00:29:35,306
VERBOSE. 

766
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:39,510
>> MY QUESTION WAS, WHAT DOES 

767
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,647
THIS MEAN FOR HIM AND HOW HE 

768
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,047
CALCULATES THIS? 

769
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,850
>> NANCY IS BACK. 

770
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,717
FINISH YOUR THOUGHT. 

771
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,853
>> I WANTED TO KEEP YOU ON YOUR 

772
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,922
TOES. 

773
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,424
>> MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. 

774
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,660
>> THE WAY MITCH McCONNELL 

775
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,729
THINKS ABOUT THIS, THE SENATE 

776
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,364
MAJORITY LEADER, HE IS PAYING 

777
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,465
SO CLOSELY ATTENTION TO THIS 

778
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,133
FOR THE SENATE RACES. 

779
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,869
HE KNOWS THEM INSIDE AND OUT 

780
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,938
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN TERMS 

781
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,373
OF HIS LEGACY FOR BEING ABLE TO 

782
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,341
GET ANOTHER JUSTICE THROUGH? 

783
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,376
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW HE 

784
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:14,879
FACTORS THIS IN AND WHAT IT 

785
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,147
MEANS FOR HIM? 

786
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,283
>> THERE IS A SENSE ON CAPITOL 

787
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,084
HILL THAT MITCH McCONNELL MAY 

788
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,619
BE ON THE VERGE OF PULLING OFF 

789
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,753
A KIND OF HAT TRICK JIU-JITSU 

790
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:28,326
MOVE WHERE IF HE IS ABLE TO 

791
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,293
KEEP ALL OF HIS REPUBLICAN 

792
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:30,428
CONFERENCE TO GATHER AND 

793
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,329
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE 

794
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,433
WOULD HAVE A MANAGED TO STEER 

795
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,869
THE SENATE THROUGH THIS VERY 

796
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,138
CONTENTIOUS PROCESS, AND KEEP 

797
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,973
HIS PARTY TOGETHER AND GET 

798
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,175
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED AND AT THE 

799
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,743
SAME TIME, ENERGIZE A LOT OF 

800
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,378
REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO WEREN'T 

801
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,713
ALL THAT FIRED UP, ACCORDING TO 

802
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,881
POLLS FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS 

803
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,517
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NOT 

804
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:54,919
MANY LEADERS ON EITHER SIDE 

805
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,021
WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL OFF. 

806
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,356
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL MANAGE 

807
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,158
TO DO IT. 

808
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,459
KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE SAME 

809
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:08,800
MITCH McCONNELL MANAGED TO GET 

810
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,834
A LOT OF SUBURBAN REPUBLICAN 

811
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,902
VOTERS AROUND CITIES LIKE 

812
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,469
PHILADELPHIA INTERESTED IN 

813
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,670
VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP, TWO 

814
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:12,970
YEARS AGO. 

815
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,972
WAS PARTLY BECAUSE HE MADE THE 

816
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:20,711
FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT A 

817
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:21,279
HUGE ISSE FOR VOTERS, 

818
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:21,913
PARTICULARLY CONSERVATIVES WHO 

819
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:22,880
CARED ABOUT THIS WHEN HE 

820
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,449
WITHHELD A SEAT THAT DEMOCRATS 

821
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:31,356
WERE TRYING TO GIVE TO MERRICK 

822
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:31,656
GARLAND. 

823
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,857
THEY BASICALLY KEPT GARLAND 

824
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:33,958
FROM HAVING A HEARING OR VOTE 

825
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:38,196
FOR 10 MONTHS AND THAT 

826
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:38,729
CONVINCED ENOUGH SUBURBAN 

827
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:39,363
REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT THIS 

828
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,831
WOULD BE A KEY ISSUE IN THE 

829
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:44,335
ELECTIONS. 

830
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,569
EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T THAT FOND 

831
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:48,072
OF DONALD TRUMP, SOME OF THEM, 

832
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,541
ENOUGH OF THEM, WENT TO THE 

833
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,876
POLLS TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR 

834
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:52,643
HIM. 

835
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,178
THIS IS SOMEONE ALWAYS PLAYING 

836
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,448
THE LONG GAME AND THE FACT THAT 

837
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,484
HE HAS BEEN SO FORCEFUL ALL 

838
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,086
ALONG HAS BEEN A STRATEGY TO 

839
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,321
KEEP THINGS ON TRACK AND NEVER 

840
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,456
SHOW WEAKNESS AND NEVER SHOW 

841
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,791
THE CONCERN THAT THINGS MIGHT 

842
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,091
FALL APART. 

843
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,559
NO MATTER WHAT DISCUSSIONS YOU 

844
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,430
HAVE, ALWAYS, IN PUBLIC, SHOW 

845
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,799
THAT YOU WILL BRING THIS TO A 

846
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,268
CLOSE AND BE SUCCESSFUL. 

847
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,302
>> NANCY, STANDBY. 

848
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,671
WE WANT TO BRIEFLY PLAY THE 

849
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:21,372
SOUNDBITE FROM REPUBLICAN 

850
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,573
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO SAID 

851
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,575
HE'S READY TO VOTE ON JUDGE 

852
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,109
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION. 

853
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,844
HE MADE THE REMARK ON CAPITOL 

854
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,413
HILL AND LET'S PLAY THAT AND WE 

855
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,380
WILL HAVE A CHAT. 

856
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,782
>> THE FBI HAS INTERVIEWED 10 

857
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:32,850
WITNESSES. 

858
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,721
THEY FOLLOWED LEADS FROM 

859
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,890
INTERVIEWS THAT MADE SENSE TO 

860
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,056
ME. 

861
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:45,329
IT'S A COMPLETE REPORT, A 

862
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:46,364
BACKGROUND CHECK AND I'M 

863
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,632
CONFIDENT THE FBI DID A GOOD 

864
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,699
JOB AND THEY WERE NOT HINDERED 

865
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:49,367
IN ANY WAY. 

866
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,668
THE FOCUS OF THE BACKGROUND 

867
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:57,508
CHECK WAS ON CREDIBLE 

868
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,309
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE THE 

869
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,510
COMMITTEE AND I WAS LOOKING FOR 

870
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,544
CERTAIN THINGS TO BE ANSWERED 

871
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:01,879
BY WITNESSES AND I'M MORE 

872
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:06,317
CONFIDENT THAT WHAT THE 

873
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,919
COMMITTEE FOUND HAS HELD UP, 

874
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,786
AND THEN SOME. 

875
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,621
THE MAIN THING FOR ME IS THAT 

876
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,990
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE FBI AND 

877
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,560
YOU NEED TO ASK THEM IF THEY 

878
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,496
FELT LIKE THEY WERE ABLE TO DO 

879
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,131
THEIR JOB WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. 

880
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,366
I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES. 

881
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,335
THEY INTERVIEWED OVER 150 

882
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,037
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF 

883
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:26,771
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE. 

884
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,408
TO THOSE WHO SUGGEST HE HAD A 

885
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,311
PROBLEM LIKE THIS FROM PRIOR 

886
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,613
INTERVIEWS, NO EVIDENCE OF 

887
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:36,080
THAT. 

888
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,580
IT'S ALL MANUFACTURED. 

889
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,582
THE SENATORS WHO REQUESTED THE 

890
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:38,182
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 

891
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,283
CHECK GOT WHAT THEY REQUESTED 

892
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,520
AND I AND READY TO VOTE. 

893
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,454
>> Reporter: ARE YOU CONFIDENT 

894
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:49,927
THE SENATORS -- >> YOU NEED TO 

895
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,163
TALK TO THEM. 

896
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,431
I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE 

897
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,098
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 

898
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,133
CHECK WAS DONE PROFESSIONALLY 

899
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,000
AND WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND 

900
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,571
INVALIDATED -- IN MY VIEW -- 

901
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,372
WHERE WE ARE. 

902
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,710
YOU NEED TO TALK TO THEM. 

903
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,145
THE IDEA THAT THE FBI WAS 

904
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:07,912
LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE WORK 

905
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:14,452
PRODUCT MADE SOME SENSE. I 

906
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,454
DIDN'T NEED IT, BUT IT'S DONE 

907
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,289
AND PUTS A STAMP ON IT THAT IS 

908
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,489
DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE. 

909
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,958
YOU NEED TO GO TO THESE THREE 

910
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,062
WHO HAVE, IN GOOD FAITH, TRIED 

911
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,362
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE 

912
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:26,763
AND WHAT IS BEST FOR THE 

913
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:31,569
COUNTRY. 

914
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,570
150 PLUS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

915
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,938
INTERVIEWED OVER A 20 SOMETHING 

916
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:34,871
YEAR PERIOD. 

917
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:40,078
NOT A CLOSE FRIEND, BUT 

918
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,645
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP. 

919
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,212
THE BRETT KAVANAUGH I KNEW 

920
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,080
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS THE 

921
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,382
BRETT KAVANAUGH I KNOW NOW AND 

922
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:46,717
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE 

923
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:50,388
EFFORT TO RUIN THIS MAN'S LIFE. 

924
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:55,226
I AM READY TO VOTE. 

925
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,728
>> YOU JUST HEARD FROM SENATOR 

926
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,796
LINDSEY GRAHAM WITH NO 

927
00:34:58,796 --> 00:34:59,830
SURPRISES AT ALL. I 

928
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,766
WILL SAY FOR HIM TO SUGGEST HE 

929
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,867
DIDN'T NEED THE FBI REPORT 

930
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:03,668
COMPLETELY DISCOUNTS THE 

931
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,502
ALLEGATION OF SOMEONE WHO SAID 

932
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:09,707
SHE HAS SURVIVED BUT LET'S LOOK 

933
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,909
AT THE FLOOR WERE SENATOR CHUCK 

934
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,311
SCHUMER IS MAKING SOME 

935
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:13,844
COMMENTS. 

936
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,379
>> AGAIN, ARE YOU ACCUSING DR. 

937
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,447
FORD OF ENGAGING IN THE 

938
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,447
POLITICS OF PERSONAL 

939
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:18,316
DESTRUCTION? 

940
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:22,820
HE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE BEING 

941
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,153
INTIMIDATED. 

942
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,121
AGAIN, MR. LEADER, ARE YOU 

943
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,390
ACCUSING DR. FORD OF 

944
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,695
INTIMIDATING THE SENATE BECAUSE 

945
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:34,899
SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO COME 

946
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:35,967
FORWARD? 

947
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,301
HE TALKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN 

948
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,869
ABOUT THE OUTRAGEOUS SMEAR. MR. 

949
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:41,239
LEADER, IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU 

950
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,876
CAME FORWARD AND CAME CLEAN. 

951
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:48,946
WHEN YOU SAY OUTRAGEOUS SMEAR, 

952
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:55,953
YOU REALLY ARE REFERRING TO 

953
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:56,821
WHAT DR. FORD SAID. 

954
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,822
YOU CAN'T SAY SO BECAUSE 

955
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,923
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT KIND OF 

956
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:03,160
RHETORIC WOULD BE OUTRAGEOUS. 

957
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,328
BUT, IT'S HER TESTIMONY THAT 

958
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:10,234
GOT THIS WHOLE THING GOING. 

959
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,003
HER TESTIMONY WAS REQUIRED BY 

960
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,104
ONE COURAGEOUS REPUBLICAN WHO 

961
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:13,938
SAID HE WOULDN'T RUSH THINGS 

962
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:14,971
THROUGH AS LEADER McCONNELL 

963
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:18,776
ATTEMPTED TO DO. 

964
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,278
THAT IS WHY THERE WAS A 

965
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,012
HEARING. 

966
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,116
IT'S NOT FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT I 

967
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,983
SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE LEADER 

968
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:30,188
IS TELLING ONE OF THE GREATEST 

969
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,889
MYSTERIES I'VE HEARD ON THE 

970
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,991
FLOOR, THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE 

971
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:34,692
DELAYED. 

972
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,127
AGAIN, MR. LEADER, WHAT POWER 

973
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,962
DO WE HAVE TO DELAY. 

974
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,563
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU SET THE 

975
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:41,532
TIME AND PLACE OF HEARINGS OR 

976
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,867
THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS DO AND USE 

977
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,135
AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF WHEN 

978
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:49,940
WE VOTE WITH NO EFFECT FROM THE 

979
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,273
DEMOCRATS? 

980
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:51,776
NO INFLUENCE BY DEMOCRATS? 

981
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,477
IF YOU DELAY, IT'S BECAUSE 

982
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,545
YOU'VE DELAYED AND IF THERE 

983
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,880
HAVE BEEN DELAYS, IT IS BECAUSE 

984
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,450
YOU HAVE DELAYED BUT 

985
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,384
ULTIMATELY, DR. FORD CAME 

986
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,785
FORWARD AND WON AMERICA'S 

987
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:04,188
HEARTS. 

988
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,122
OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WERE 

989
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:05,923
UPSET BECAUSE THAT MIGHT DERAIL 

990
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:10,861
THEIR HEADLONG RUSH TO PUT 

991
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:11,962
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ON THE SUPREME 

992
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,264
COURT. 

993
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:21,105
IT WAS LED BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

994
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,306
AT HIS RETURN TESTIMONY AND BY 

995
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,374
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND BY 

996
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:23,774
LEADER McCONNELL. 

997
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,043
THEY'VE TRIED TO MISDIRECT THE 

998
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:33,184
WHOLE ISSUE AWAY FROM DR. FORD, 

999
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,418
WHO WAS THE CAUSE AND THE 

1000
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,586
REASON WE ARE DEBATING ALL OF 

1001
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:42,993
THIS AND TOWARDS OTHER MEN AND 

1002
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:46,163
WOMEN, MANY THAT ARE DEMOCRATS, 

1003
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:46,864
COINCIDENTLY. 

1004
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:55,039
IT'S WRONG. OUR REPUBLICAN 

1005
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,940
FRIENDS ARE DOING WHAT MY DEAR 

1006
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,007
FRIEND THE LEADER IS DOING, AND 

1007
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,776
IT'S DEMEANING TO DR. FORD. 

1008
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,146
DEMEANING IS THE LAST THING 

1009
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,381
DOCTOR FORD AND OTHERS WHO HAVE 

1010
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,715
GONE THROUGH WHAT SHE HAS GONE 

1011
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:08,152
THROUGH NEED NOW. 

1012
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,389
OR, DESERVES NOW. 

1013
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,656
SO, I WOULD SAY TO THE LEADER, 

1014
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:13,891
IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

1015
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:14,525
PARTISAN HISTRIONICS, IF YOU 

1016
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:23,134
ARE TALKING ABOUT POLITICS OF 

1017
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,101
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION, IF YOU 

1018
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:24,835
ARE TALKING ABOUT BEING 

1019
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:25,603
INTIMIDATED AND TALKING ABOUT 

1020
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,603
OUTRAGEOUS SMEARS, YOU ARE 

1021
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:31,208
REALLY ACCUSING DR. FORD OF ALL 

1022
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,178
THOSE THINGS, NOT ANYONE ELSE. 

1023
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,312
BECAUSE, SHE IS THE REASON WE 

1024
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:36,379
ARE ALL HERE IN THIS TYPE OF 

1025
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:37,081
DISCUSSION. 

1026
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,717
NO DEMOCRAT IMPORTUNED HER TO 

1027
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,452
COME. 

1028
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,055
NO DEMOCRAT. SENATOR FEINSTEIN 

1029
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,189
TRIED TO RESPECT HER WISHES AND 

1030
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:50,027
NOT MAKE IT PUBLIC. 

1031
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,663
THAT WAS NOT A POLITICAL 

1032
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,964
INSTINCT, IT WAS A HUMAN 

1033
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:54,632
INSTINCT. 

1034
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,133
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, SENATOR 

1035
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,368
FEINSTEIN STAFF CALLED EACH WEEK

1036
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,403
AND ASKED IF SHE WANTED TO GO 

1037
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,840
PUBLIC NOW AND DR. FORD SAID NO 

1038
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,707
AND DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND 

1039
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:04,040
RESPECTED IT. 

1040
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,574
BECAUSE SHE DID THAT, THE 

1041
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:07,078
REPUBLICAN FRIENDS ACCUSE HER OF

1042
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:07,411
MANIPULATING. 

1043
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:07,845
MANIPULATING WHAT? 

1044
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,812
DR. FORD'S DESIRE TO KEEP THIS 

1045
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:13,884
PRIVATE? 

1046
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,052
WE HEARD WHAT DR. FORD SAID. 

1047
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:15,686
SHE WRESTLED WITH DECIDING 

1048
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,887
WHETHER TO GO PUBLIC AND KNEW 

1049
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,155
THE DAMAGE IT WOULD CREATE FOR 

1050
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,125
HER FAMILY AND FOR HER LIFE, 

1051
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:28,966
HER VERY LIFE. 

1052
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,101
SHE DECIDED SHE HAD AN 

1053
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:32,837
OBLIGATION TO COME FORWARD. 

1054
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:33,971
SHE DECIDED SHE HAD TOO. 

1055
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,107
I BELIEVE HER. A 

1056
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:36,941
LARGE NUMBER OF AMERICANS 

1057
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:37,274
BELIEVE HER. 

1058
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,275
EVEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE HER, 

1059
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,543
AND YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE JUDGE 

1060
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:44,081
KAVANAUGH, DON'T DEMEAN DR. FORD

1061
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,315
. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE 

1062
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:46,817
DOING. 

1063
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:53,157
IT'S A SHAME, A LOW POINT IN A 

1064
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:57,294
HEADLONG RUSH TO GET SOMEBODY 

1065
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,529
WHO HAS VIEWS OUT OF TOUCH WITH 

1066
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:03,067
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IN ALL 

1067
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,468
LIKELIHOOD, THEY WOULD GREATLY 

1068
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:13,010
LIMIT WOMEN'S HEALTH AND THE 

1069
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,144
RIGHT TO CHOOSE, WHO WOULD 

1070
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:14,744
GREATLY CONSTRAIN HEALTHCARE 

1071
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:20,184
AND WOULD ALLOW THE PRESIDENT 

1072
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,385
THIS OVERREACHING PRECEDENT TO 

1073
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,019
OVERREACH WITH NO CONSTRAINT. 

1074
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,454
DR. FORD SEEMS TO BE A CASUALTY 

1075
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:28,325
ALONG THE WAY. 

1076
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,393
IN TERMS OF THE NAME CALLING, 

1077
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:32,530
THE NASTINESS, AND THE 

1078
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:32,863
VICIOUSNESS. 

1079
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,265
THEY DON'T SAY IT IS DR. FORD. 

1080
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,901
BUT, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. 

1081
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,768
IT IS HER THEY ARE TALKING 

1082
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:39,002
ABOUT. 

1083
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:39,869
<font color="#FF0000"><u>T WAS ONLY SHE WHO BROUGHT </u></font>

1084
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:41,071
THESE THINGS UP, NOT DEMOCRATS. 

1085
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:46,744
DEMOCRATS DIDN'T PUT WORDS IN 

1086
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:47,044
HER MOUTH. 

1087
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:47,844
THESE CAME FROM THE HEART. 

1088
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:55,553
NOW, I MAKE THREE FINAL POINTS 

1089
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,587
ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE 

1090
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,854
RELEASED LATE LAST NIGHT. 

1091
00:40:57,854 --> 00:40:58,989
FIRST, WE DEMOCRATS HAD MANY 

1092
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:06,697
FEARS THAT THIS WOULD BE AN ALL 

1093
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:07,631
TOO LIMITED PROCESS THAT WOULD 

1094
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,999
CONSTRAIN THE FBI FROM GETTING 

1095
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:14,238
THE FACTS. HAVING RECEIVED A 

1096
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,372
THOROUGH BRIEFING A FEW MINUTES 

1097
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,407
AGO, OUR FEARS HAVE BEEN 

1098
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,143
REALIZED. 

1099
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,077
OUR FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED 

1100
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,780
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A THOROUGH 

1101
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,185
INVESTIGATION. 

1102
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,887
ACCORDING TO DR. FORD'S LAWYERS 

1103
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,322
AND THE LAWYERS FOR MS. 

1104
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:31,956
RAMIREZ, THERE WERE MANY 

1105
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,090
WITNESSES THAT WISHED TO BE 

1106
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,790
INTERVIEWED AND THEY SAID THEY 

1107
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:34,791
WERE NOT INTERVIEWED. 

1108
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:35,793
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. 

1109
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,530
WHY NOT? 

1110
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,664
WHAT LIMITS WERE PLACED ON THE 

1111
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:48,105
FBI? 

1112
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,673
IT WAS THAT THEY COULDN'T DO A 

1113
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,073
FULL AND THOROUGH 

1114
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:50,440
INVESTIGATION. 

1115
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,642
THE WORD IS IT WAS THE WHITE 

1116
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:58,382
HOUSE. 

1117
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,349
IT WAS IMPORTUNED BY SOME 

1118
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,950
SENATE STAFFERS HERE. 

1119
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,285
WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TWO 

1120
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,052
CHOICES. 

1121
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:08,626
THEY CAN ADMIT IT OR IF THEY 

1122
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,893
DENY IT, THEY SHOULD, AT THE 

1123
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:10,661
VERY MINIMUM, MAKE THE 

1124
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,162
DIRECTIVE THAT THEY SENT TO THE 

1125
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:18,736
FBI PUBLIC. IF THE WHITE HOUSE 

1126
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,604
DIDN'T LIMIT WHAT THEY FBI 

1127
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,107
NORMALLY DOES WHEN THEY DO ONE 

1128
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,642
OF THESE BACKGROUND CHECKS, IT 

1129
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,510
SURE SEEMS THEY DID, GIVEN THE 

1130
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,645
LIMITED NUMBER OF WITNESSES OR 

1131
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,512
SO MANY WITNESSES THAT WEREN'T 

1132
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,647
CALLED THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. 

1133
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,416
MAKE IT PUBLIC. 

1134
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,953
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE 

1135
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,321
WHETHER IT WAS TRULY LIMITED OR 

1136
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:41,792
NOT. 

1137
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,360
AND WHAT ELSE SHOULD BE MADE 

1138
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,461
PUBLIC ARE THESE DOCUMENTS THAT 

1139
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,628
WE ARE ALLOWED TO LOOK AT. 

1140
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:49,266
FIRST, AGAIN, THE IDEA THAT 

1141
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,066
THIS SHOULD BE FULL AND 

1142
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:55,673
THOROUGH AND OPEN AND AVAILABLE

1143
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,607
, IT'S ONCE AGAIN BELIED BY THE 

1144
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:01,011
PETTINESS OF THE REPUBLICAN SIDE

1145
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,313
AND THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1146
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,548
THERE'S ONLY ONE DOCUMENT FOR 

1147
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,783
100 MEMBERS TO SEE IN THE 

1148
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,117
COURSE OF THE DAY. 

1149
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,119
THAT IS VERY HARD TO DO. 

1150
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,055
THERE'S A LOT OF DOCUMENTS AND 

1151
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,157
ONLY ONE COPY OF THE DOCUMENTS. 

1152
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,292
WHY AREN'T THERE 10 COPIES IN 

1153
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:15,592
THAT ROOM? 

1154
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:16,560
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE? 

1155
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,096
IT'S JUST A PATTERN. 

1156
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,096
A PATTERN OF LIMITING ACCESS TO 

1157
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:22,032
FACTS AND LIMITING ACCESS TO 

1158
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:25,636
TRUTH AND LIMITING ACCESS TO 

1159
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,937
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUGHT 

1160
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:33,210
TO KNOW. 

1161
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,812
SO, I REITERATE MY CALL, 

1162
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,513
PARTICULARLY AFTER RECEIVING THE

1163
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,715
BRIEFING ABOUT WHAT THE 

1164
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:38,182
DOCUMENTS CONTAINED. 

1165
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:38,782
THEY SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC. 

1166
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,983
OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAS TO BE 

1167
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,251
APPROPRIATE REDACTIONS. 

1168
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,185
AND, THERE SHOULD BE TO PROTECT 

1169
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:50,761
THE PRIVACY OF THOSE WHO WERE 

1170
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,094
INTERVIEWED. 

1171
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:52,630
BUT, THERE IS NO REASON ON GODS 

1172
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,497
GREEN GREEN EARTH THAT THOSE 

1173
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,431
DOCUMENTS CAN'T BE MADE PUBLIC. 

1174
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:59,303
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE. 

1175
00:43:59,303 --> 00:43:59,937
LEADER McCONNELL SAID FROM THE 

1176
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,338
BEGINNING TO THE EFFECT HE 

1177
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,073
WOULD RUSH THIS THROUGH, 

1178
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,875
STARTING WITH NOT RELEASING 

1179
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:05,742
DOCUMENTS, FOLLOWED BY 

1180
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:10,380
CONSTRAINTS FROM OUR SENATE 

1181
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,549
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ON WHAT 

1182
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,817
SHOULD BE LIMITATIONS ON THE 

1183
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,620
FBI'S ABILITY TO DO THE NEW 

1184
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,657
BACKGROUND CHECK ALL THE WAY TO 

1185
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,557
THIS MORNING WITH ONE DOCUMENT 

1186
00:44:21,557 --> 00:44:22,493
IN THAT ROOM. 

1187
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:27,164
THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE 

1188
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,532
REPUBLICAN SIDE IN THE SENATE 

1189
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,834
HAS ATTEMPTED TO RUSH THIS 

1190
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:32,669
THROUGH REGARDLESS OF THE 

1191
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:33,771
FACTS. 

1192
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:39,076
IT'S WRONG. THE RELATIONSHIPS 

1193
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:42,579
BETWEEN THIS, WHICH WE ALL WANT 

1194
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,016
TO BE BETTER, IT HURTS WITH THE 

1195
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:46,750
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE 

1196
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,655
REPUTATION OF THE FBI AND ABOVE 

1197
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,689
ALL, IT HURTS THE SUPREME COURT 

1198
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:59,663
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

1199
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,399
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, ONCE 

1200
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:02,866
AGAIN. 

1201
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,534
OF THIS PROCESSHAD BEEN OPEN 

1202
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,403
AND FAIR, THE OUTCOME MAY HAVE 

1203
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,104
BEEN DIFFRENT OR MAYBE IT 

1204
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:07,538
WOULDN'T. 

1205
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:07,905
WHO COULD TELL? 

1206
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:08,972
AT LEAST THERE WOULD BE SOME 

1207
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,174
RESPECT FOR THE PROCESS. 

1208
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,541
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED AND THAT 

1209
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:16,046
IS VERY BAD FOR THIS BODY, FOR 

1210
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:21,351
THE SUPREME COURT AND FOR THESE 

1211
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,385
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

1212
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:27,558
I YIELD TO THE FLOOR. 

1213
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,992
>> THE CLERK WILL CALL THE 

1214
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:33,163
ROLL. 

1215
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,631
>>> WE JUST HEARD FROM CHUCK 

1216
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:35,899
SCHUMER AND IT LOOKS LIKE 

1217
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,134
SENATOR KENNEDY, JOHN KENNEDY, 

1218
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,270
IS MAKING A STATEMENT TO THE 

1219
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:40,671
PRESS. 

1220
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:41,071
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

1221
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:47,778
>> YOU WERE SURPRISED, WHY? 

1222
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,213
I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY 

1223
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:49,880
IS CLEAR. 

1224
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,313
STALL AND RESTALL. 

1225
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:53,417
I SAID THIS THE OTHER DAY. 

1226
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,185
PUT DOWN THE SEARCH OF THE 

1227
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,789
TRUTH, THIS IS SMASHMOUTH RAW 

1228
00:45:58,789 --> 00:45:59,055
POLITICS. 

1229
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:03,227
THAT'S ALL IT IS AND I WISH I 

1230
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:07,698
DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT. 

1231
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,431
I'M NOT SAYING SOME PEOPLE 

1232
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:09,166
AREN'T IN GOOD FAITH. 

1233
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:09,633
THEY ARE, I THINK. 

1234
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:19,209
BUT, THERE ARE MANY -- THE 

1235
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,777
MANTRA AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF 

1236
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:21,945
THIS IS TO WIN, BABY. 

1237
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:22,212
JUST WIN. 

1238
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,447
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO GETS 

1239
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:32,256
HURT. 

1240
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:32,989
DR. FORD, DOESN'T MATTER. 

1241
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,191
RUN RIGHT OVER HER IN BREACH OF 

1242
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:34,925
CONFIDENTIALITY AND RUIN HER 

1243
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:35,959
FAMILY AND RUIN HER REPUTATION. 

1244
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,895
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE'S 

1245
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:38,562
EXPENDABLE, THEY THINK. 

1246
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:38,995
IT DOESN'T MATTER. 

1247
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:39,563
DESTROY HIS REPUTATION AND 

1248
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:45,469
DESTROY HIS FAMILY. 

1249
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,005
WHOEVER GETS IN THE WAY IS RUN 

1250
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:48,805
OVER. 

1251
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,307
THIS ISN'T ABOUT A SEARCH FOR 

1252
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,775
THE TRUTH, IT IS WIN, BABY, WIN 

1253
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:52,876
AT ANY COST AND I'VE BEEN HERE 

1254
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,812
FOR 20 MONTHS, NOW. 

1255
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,380
IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE REALLY 

1256
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,084
SEEN THE DARK SIDE OF THIS 

1257
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,920
PLACE. 

1258
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,189
IT'S NOT PRETTY. 

1259
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:05,489
NOT PRETTY. 

1260
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,556
AMERICA DESERVES BETTER THAN 

1261
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:11,194
THIS. 

1262
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:11,628
ANYTHING ELSE? 

1263
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:15,365
AND LET ME SAY ONE OTHER THING. 

1264
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,867
AFTER THIS IS OVER, ONE WAY OR 

1265
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:20,070
THE OTHER, IT WILL BE PEOPLE 

1266
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,138
SPINNING ABOUT WHO WON AND WHO 

1267
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:21,338
LOST. 

1268
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,272
I ATTENDED EVERY MINUTE OF THE 

1269
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,540
HEARING WITH DR. FORD AND JUDGE 

1270
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,310
KAVANAUGH. 

1271
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,544
THERE WERE NO WINNERS IN THAT 

1272
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,546
ROOM. 

1273
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,949
NON-. ALL I SAW WERE TWO HUMAN 

1274
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:34,818
BEINGS IN PAIN. 

1275
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,020
ESPECIALLY DR. FORD. 

1276
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:43,527
WHOEVER FAILED IN THEIR 

1277
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,194
MISSION, THE RESPONSIBILITY TO 

1278
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,064
TELL DR. FORD THAT SHE HAD THE 

1279
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:52,469
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY PRIVATELY

1280
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,470
, TO THE SENATE INVESTIGATORS 

1281
00:47:53,470 --> 00:48:01,010
AND IN HER HOME, THEY OUGHT TO 

1282
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:04,381
HIDE HIS OR HER HEAD IN A BAG. 

1283
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,148
THAT IS JUST UNCONSCIONABLE. 

1284
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:05,615
WHOEVER BREACHED THE 

1285
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:06,282
CONFIDENTIALITY OF DR. FORD AND 

1286
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:09,653
LEAKED HER CONFIDENTIAL LETTER, 

1287
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:16,326
THEY HAVE NO SOUL. 

1288
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,094
>> OKAY. 

1289
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:27,771
WE APPRECIATE IT. 

1290
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:29,973
>>> SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY OF 

1291
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,408
LOUISIANA IS MAKING SOME 

1292
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,608
COMMENTS TO MEMBERS OF THE 

1293
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:33,377
PRESS. 

1294
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,978
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE ARE 

1295
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,213
HEARING FROM THE REPUBLICANS ON 

1296
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:39,115
MONDAY IS THAT THE FBI REPORT 

1297
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:40,417
REVEALS NOTHING NEW AND THAT 

1298
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,284
MEANS BRETT KAVANAUGH CAN BE 

1299
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:42,853
AND SHOULD BE CONFIRMED 

1300
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:43,887
IMMEDIATELY AND DEMOCRATS SAY 

1301
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,455
THE PROCESS IS RIGGED AND WE 

1302
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,823
DON'T HAVE TIME TO CONDUCT THE 

1303
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:47,591
INVESTIGATION AND THERE WASN'T 

1304
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,025
ENOUGH TIME TO TALK TO OTHER 

1305
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,061
FOLKS. 

1306
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,964
ON THE BUBBLE, WHAT THEY WOULD 

1307
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:58,068
DO IT IS THAT WE WOULD SEE A 

1308
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:08,145
NARRATIVE THIS IS WHAT THEY 

1309
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,247
WOULD ASK FOR, THIS IS WHAT THE 

1310
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:10,947
SENATORS WOULD ASK FOR. 

1311
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:11,982
JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN COLLINS,WE 

1312
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:16,320
GAVE IT TO THEM AND I WAS READY 

1313
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,255
TO DO THIS LAST WEEK AND TWO 

1314
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,923
WEEKS AGO BUT THEY WANTED TO 

1315
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,626
CHECK INTO THIS AND WE LET THEM 

1316
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:22,893
DO THIS. 

1317
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,829
THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SAY 

1318
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,230
-- AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM CHUCK 

1319
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,931
SCHUMER -- THAT THIS IS NOT 

1320
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:29,266
POLITICS. 

1321
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,701
JOHN KENNEDY SAID IT'S NOT 

1322
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:32,069
POLITICS. 

1323
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,704
THIS IS A WOMAN, LIKE MANY 

1324
00:49:34,704 --> 00:49:36,640
WOMEN, WHO CAME FORWARD ABOUT 

1325
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,241
SOMETHING THAT IS HORRIFIC AND 

1326
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,844
HAPPENED TO HER AND HAPPENED TO 

1327
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,779
OTHER WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. 

1328
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:46,650
WHAT YOU ESSENTIALLY ARE DOING 

1329
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,417
IS DISCOUNTING HER ALLEGATION 

1330
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,451
BY SAYING THAT SHE SOMEHOW WAS 

1331
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:50,153
A POLITICAL PAWN. 

1332
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,421
SOMEHOW, SHE IS A DEMOCRATIC 

1333
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,858
OPERATIVE WHO HAD BEEN IN PLACE 

1334
00:49:54,858 --> 00:50:00,731
TO TAKE DOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

1335
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,533
>> THAT IS WHY YOU HEAR 

1336
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,902
REPUBLICANS FOCUSING OVER AND 

1337
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,270
OVER AGAIN ON THE PROCESS AND 

1338
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,805
THAT IS A WAY FOR THEM TO AT 

1339
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,808
LEAST PUBLICLY SAY THAT WE FEEL 

1340
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:14,211
FOR DR. FORD AND WE FEEL FOR 

1341
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,212
KAVANAUGH AND THAT DEMOCRATS 

1342
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,114
DID A DISSERVICE TO BOTH OF 

1343
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,315
THEM, AS YOU HEARD KENNEDY SAY. 

1344
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,249
IT WAS THE WAY THEY WENT ABOUT 

1345
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:24,421
THIS WILL REAP -- WITH 

1346
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,022
REPUBLICANS HAVING ADS IN 

1347
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,824
SENATE RACES FOCUSING ON THE 

1348
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,593
PROCESS AND THEY FEEL THAT IS 

1349
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,427
THE WAY TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE. 

1350
00:50:31,427 --> 00:50:34,030
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS BACK 

1351
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,999
AND FORTH BETWEEN REPUBLICANS 

1352
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,100
AND DEMOCRATS ON THE SAME 

1353
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,401
COMMITTEE WHO HAVE VIEWED THE 

1354
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,169
SAME DOCUMENT, PRESENTING TWO 

1355
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:43,006
DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT 

1356
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,175
HAPPENED AND WHAT SHOULD 

1357
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:45,408
HAPPEN. 

1358
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:47,811
AT THE END OF THE DAY, 

1359
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,012
REPUBLICANS CONTROL ALL OF THE 

1360
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,747
MOVEMENT ON THE FLOOR AND THEY 

1361
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:51,748
CONTROL THE SENATE. 

1362
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,450
YOU SAW MITCH McCONNELL AS VERY 

1363
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,452
EAGER TO VOTE WITH A LOT OF 

1364
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,655
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE EAGER 

1365
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,757
TO VOTE AND GET THIS BEHIND 

1366
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:01,057
THEM. 

1367
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,860
THEY ARE FUELED BY SHOWING THIS 

1368
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,362
ENTHUSIASM AND ITS INCREASED 12 

1369
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,863
POINTS ACCORDING TO THE NPR 

1370
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:07,464
POLL RELEASED. 

1371
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,665
AMONG REPUBLICANS, IT'S REALLY 

1372
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,333
IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH 

1373
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,368
THEY ARE IN POWER, THEY HAVE 

1374
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,903
NOT REALLY FOUND AN ISSUE THAT 

1375
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:17,073
REALLY MOTIVATES THE VOTERS TO 

1376
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,141
TURN OUT AND SAY THANKS. 

1377
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,276
THEY HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING 

1378
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,911
THAT MOTIVATES THEM TO TURN OUT 

1379
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,779
AND BE ANGRY ABOUT THE OTHER 

1380
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,214
SIDE AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO 

1381
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,183
WHEN YOU ARE IN POWER BECAUSE 

1382
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,584
YOU CONTROL EVERYTHING ON THIS 

1383
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,353
ISSUE THEY FOUND IT AND THAT IS 

1384
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,656
WHETHER THEY CAN SUSTAIN THAT, 

1385
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:33,890
MOVING FORWARD. 

1386
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:34,624
THE OTHER THING -- I'M 

1387
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:35,592
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT SUSAN 

1388
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,227
COLLINS THINKS OF THIS REPORT 

1389
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,729
AND WAGER -- AND WHETHER SHE 

1390
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,165
THINKS IT WAS DONE FAIRLY OR IS 

1391
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,568
ACCEPTING OF THE RESULTS. 

1392
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,836
OF COURSE, SHE IS THE MOST 

1393
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,405
IMPORTANT VOICE ON THIS AT THE 

1394
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:48,638
MOMENT. 

1395
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,407
>> ALSO, THINKING ABOUT THE RED 

1396
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,008
STATE DEMOCRATS AND WHETHER OR 

1397
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,277
NOT IT IS SAFE FOR THEM TO VOTE 

1398
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:54,577
RIGHT NOW. 

1399
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:55,077
INDIVIDUALLY, THEY ARE 

1400
00:51:55,077 --> 00:51:58,782
MAINTAINING THEIR SEAT. 

1401
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,185
IF THERE IS OVERWHELMING 

1402
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,520
SUPPORT, THEY DON'T REALLY 

1403
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,521
FACTOR IN HOW THEY VOTE. 

1404
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:05,822
I IMAGINE THAT NO ONE WANTS TO 

1405
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:06,990
BE LIKE THE DECIDING VOTE. 

1406
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:12,562
>> IT FACTORS INTO THEIR 

1407
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:13,496
REELECTIONS, IF YOU ARE JOE 

1408
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:13,763
MANCHIN. 

1409
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,430
>> WE'RE SEEING POLLING WHERE 

1410
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,298
IT SHOWS NORTH DAKOTA THAT 

1411
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,100
SHOWS ALMOST A DOUBLE DIGIT 

1412
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:26,776
LEAD FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. 

1413
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:30,780
REMEMBER, THAT IS WHY WE PAY 

1414
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,148
ATTENTION TO JOE MANCHIN, WHO 

1415
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,116
ALSO VOTED FOR GORSUCH AND 

1416
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,216
COMES FROM A STATE THAT DONALD 

1417
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:37,587
TRUMP ONE OVERWHELMINGLY AND IS 

1418
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:37,854
POPULAR. 

1419
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:38,822
THIS IS A DIFFICULT POSITION 

1420
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:43,159
AND ALSO WHY REPUBLICANS ARE 

1421
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,794
EAGER TO HAVE A VOTE ON THIS 

1422
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:45,996
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN 

1423
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,163
CORNER THESE RED STATE 

1424
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:48,265
DEMOCRATS AND EVEN IF THEY 

1425
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,399
DON'T VOTE WITH THEM, THEY 

1426
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:55,405
ANTICIPATE THAT THEY ARE ABLE 

1427
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:57,573
TO CAPTURE THE VOTE AND RUN ADS 

1428
00:52:57,573 --> 00:52:59,509
IN PLACES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA, 

1429
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,577
INDIANA AND WEST VIRGINIA, YOU 

1430
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,944
NAME IT AND SAY THIS PERSON WAS 

1431
00:53:01,944 --> 00:53:07,450
AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA. 

1432
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,153
>> WE HAVE A STATEMENT FROM 

1433
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,554
SUSAN COLLINS. 

1434
00:53:11,554 --> 00:53:13,290
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET HER ON 

1435
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,458
CAMERA BUT SHE SAID, THEIR 

1436
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,526
APPEARS TO BE A THOROUGH 

1437
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,427
INVESTIGATION BUT I'M GOING 

1438
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:18,795
BACK LATER TODAY TO PERSONALLY 

1439
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,029
READ THE INTERVIEWS. 

1440
00:53:20,029 --> 00:53:21,497
THAT IS REALLY ALL I HAVE TO 

1441
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:22,365
SAY RIGHT NOW. 

1442
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,567
>> IT SEEMS LIKE SHE IS TRYING 

1443
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:25,168
TO GET TO A YES. 

1444
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,302
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO 

1445
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:31,541
CONSIDER. 

1446
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,575
THE REASON REPUBLICANS HAVE 

1447
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:34,210
UNITED AROUND DONALD TRUMP WAS 

1448
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,779
MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY 

1449
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,447
TO APPOINT SUPREME COURT 

1450
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,116
JUSTICES AND SHAPE THE BENCHES 

1451
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,886
AROUND THE COUNTRY ON A FEDERAL 

1452
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,119
LEVEL. 

1453
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,821
SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN TALKING 

1454
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,256
FAVORABLY BEFORE THE 

1455
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:46,890
ALLEGATIONS CAME OUT, TALKING 

1456
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,926
PRETTY FAVORABLY ABOUT 

1457
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:50,226
KAVANAUGH. 

1458
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,529
HER ONE STICKING POINT OR ONE OF

1459
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,097
THEM, WAS THE ISSUE OF ROE V. 

1460
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:55,465
WADE. 

1461
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,766
SHE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT 

1462
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:57,901
HE WOULD HONOR PRESIDENT AND 

1463
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,502
EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THE COURT 

1464
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,271
WOULDN'T OVERTURN HEALTH CARE, 

1465
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:04,007
AND ANOTHER KEY ISSUE FOR THESE 

1466
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,542
FOLKS. 

1467
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,177
SO, THE INVESTIGATION, AS WE 

1468
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,044
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, IT COULD 

1469
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:08,745
PROVIDE A POLITICAL COVER. 

1470
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,378
THE FBI PROBE COULD PROVIDE 

1471
00:54:09,378 --> 00:54:14,550
THAT FOR REPUBLICANS THAT 

1472
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,587
WANTED TO GET TO A YES BUT WERE 

1473
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,789
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BACKDROP OF 

1474
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,222
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 

1475
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:22,559
>> AS YOU SAID DURING THE 

1476
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,427
CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE WEREN'T ON

1477
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,262
CAMERA, THIS MAY ULTIMATELY -- 

1478
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:30,200
AND I THINK NANCY POINTED OUT 

1479
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,902
-- FOR LEADER McCONNELL, THIS 

1480
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,237
ACTION HAVING THE FBI DO THE 

1481
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,138
INVESTIGATION ULTIMATELY WAS 

1482
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:35,905
COALESCING FOR REPUBLICANS. 

1483
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,640
EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF 

1484
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,843
DONALD TRUMP AND YOU ARE A 

1485
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,412
REPUBLICAN, YOU CAME OUT IN 

1486
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:43,813
SUPPORT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH 

1487
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,281
BECAUSE YOU FELT HE WAS BEING 

1488
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,516
UNFAIRLY TREATED, RAILROADED. 

1489
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,451
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO 

1490
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,320
CHARACTERIZE IT, THE QUESTION 

1491
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,855
IS THAT IT IS A WIN FOR THE 

1492
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,022
REPUBLICANS IF HE IS NOMINATED 

1493
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:55,558
AND CONFIRMED. 

1494
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,927
BUT, WHAT HAPPENS TO MODERATE 

1495
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:58,962
WOMEN IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS 

1496
00:54:58,962 --> 00:54:59,863
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO MODERATE 

1497
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:00,897
WOMEN GOING FORWARD AND WE KNOW 

1498
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:05,969
THAT THE BASE IS STRONG AND WE 

1499
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:06,870
KNOW DONALD TRUMP REMAINS 

1500
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,637
POPULAR AMONG REPUBLICANS. 

1501
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,538
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE THAT ARE 

1502
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,273
UNDECIDED AND DON'T LIKE THINGS 

1503
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:13,676
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? 

1504
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:16,613
>> OUR CBS BATTLEGROUND 

1505
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:17,480
TRACKING POLL SHOWED A 12-POINT 

1506
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,515
DIFFERENCE IN THE GENDER GAP 

1507
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:22,452
FAVORING DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF 

1508
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,019
THEIR VIEWS ON KAVANAUGH. 

1509
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:23,720
WOMEN ARE PLAYING A CRITICAL 

1510
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,825
ROLE IN THE ELECTION. 

1511
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,460
THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE 

1512
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,628
COMPETITIVE IN NOVEMBER, THEY 

1513
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,763
COULD SWAY THE BALANCE OF POWER 

1514
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,931
IN THE HOUSE. 

1515
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:35,965
IF NOT, THE SENATE. 

1516
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,535
SO, WOMEN HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS 

1517
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,603
OF ALL OF THIS AND OF COURSE, 

1518
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:43,006
IT COMES AGAINST THE BACKDROP 

1519
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,774
OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT AND YOU 

1520
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,343
ARE SEEING A TIME MAGAZINE 

1521
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,179
COVER THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTINE 

1522
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,280
BLASEY FORD ILLUSTRATED BY HER 

1523
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,181
OWN WORDS, A VERY POWERFUL 

1524
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:52,615
COVER. 

1525
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,250
WE'VE SEEN WOMEN RUNNING FOR 

1526
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,386
OFFICE IN RECORD NUMBERS AND 

1527
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,253
THAT RECORD NUMBER HAS FAVORED 

1528
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,455
DEMOCRATS MORE THAN 

1529
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:58,788
REPUBLICANS. 

1530
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,056
YOU SEE CANDIDATES REALLY 

1531
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,857
PLAYING THAT UP ON THE CAMPAIGN 

1532
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:02,091
TRAIL. 

1533
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:06,262
AS WE KNOW, WOMEN ARE NOT A 

1534
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:09,065
MONOLITHIC GROUP, OF COURSE IN 

1535
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,200
DONALD TRUMP TALKS A LOT ABOUT 

1536
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,167
HOW HE WON REPUBLICAN WOMEN. 

1537
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:11,734
WHITE WOMEN. 

1538
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:20,977
HE SAYS HE

1539
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:23,947
>> REPUBLICANS ARE FACTORING IN 

1540
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,082
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

1541
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,884
HAS SO ALIENATED SOME OF THE 

1542
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,586
SWING VOTERS THAT THEY ARE 

1543
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:35,058
ALREADY IN THE HOLE. 

1544
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,459
THE KEY STRATEGY AT THIS POINT 

1545
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,028
IS TO KEEP THE BASE EXCITED AND 

1546
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:40,129
INCENTIVIZED TO TURN OUT AND 

1547
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:40,329
VOTE. 

1548
00:56:40,329 --> 00:56:47,436
THAT IS THE FOCAL POINT RIGHT 

1549
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:48,638
NOW AND THEY BELIEVE AT THIS 

1550
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,073
POINT IN TIME, WE ARE STILL IN 

1551
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,674
OCTOBER, A MONTH AWAY, THEY 

1552
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,409
BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A GAME 

1553
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,210
CHANGER IN TERMS OF MOMENTUM 

1554
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,144
FOR THEM ON THE REPUBLICAN 

1555
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:55,445
SIDE. 

1556
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,080
>> EVERY TIME THE PRESIDENT 

1557
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:06,756
MAKES FUN OF A VICTIM, LIKE HE 

1558
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,557
DID CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, 

1559
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:08,458
REPUBLICANS MUST BE BITING 

1560
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:08,791
THEIR NAILS. 

1561
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,293
YOU SAW A LOT OF THEM COME OUT 

1562
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,128
AND SAY THEY THOUGHT IT WAS 

1563
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:12,629
HORRIBLE. 

1564
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,464
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, IT IS 

1565
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,467
HORRIBLE, BUT I AM STILL VOTING 

1566
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,236
TO CONFIRM. 

1567
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:20,736
>> YOU HEARD COLLINS, 

1568
00:57:20,736 --> 00:57:21,537
MURKOWSKI, FLAKE, ALL CONDEMNED 

1569
00:57:21,537 --> 00:57:25,408
THE PRESIDENTS LANGUAGE, BUT IF 

1570
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:26,809
THEY VOTE TO CONFIRM HIM, HE 

1571
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:27,409
WON'T FACE A POLITICAL 

1572
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:31,080
úCONSEQU 

1573
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,215
THE POLITICAL MAP IS BECOMING 

1574
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,116
MORE COMPETITIVE, BUT IT DOES 

1575
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,984
FAVOR REPUBLICANS AT THIS TIME, 

1576
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,419
GIVEN THE STATES THAT ARE IN 

1577
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:37,854
PLAY AND WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS 

1578
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,156
POPULAR. 

1579
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,491
ON THE HOUSE SIDE, THEY ARE 

1580
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,292
COMPETING ON A DIFFERENT 

1581
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:42,625
BATTLEFIELD. 

1582
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,463
THEY ARE COMPLETING -- COMPETING

1583
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,864
IN THE SUBURBS, CHANGING THE 

1584
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:52,635
DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE IT -- WHERE 

1585
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,770
WOMEN ARE PLAYING A KEY ROLE. 

1586
00:57:53,770 --> 00:58:05,014
THERE IS A CONCERN THAT HE 

1587
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:05,614
FURTHER ALIENATES FOLKS IN 

1588
00:58:05,614 --> 00:58:06,316
THOSE KEY DISTRICTS. 

1589
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,650
IT REALLY IS A TALE OF TWO 

1590
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:07,950
ELECTIONS. 

1591
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,385
>> ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOUR 

1592
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:09,652
INSIGHT. 

1593
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,054
I KNOW YOU WILL BE WITH US FOR 

1594
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:12,088
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. 

1595
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,356
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND 

1596
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,190
DIGEST EVERYTHING THAT HAS 

1597
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,391
HAPPENED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 

1598
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:15,624
HOURS. 

1599
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:17,026
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF NEWS, 

1600
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,296
INCLUDING THAT STORY OUT OF 

1601
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,097
SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE WE HAVE 

1602
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,098
BEEN GETTING NEW INFORMATION 

1603
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,132
OVER THE COURSE OF THESE LAST 

1604
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:28,471
COUPLE OF HOURS, AS TO WHAT 

1605
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,539
HAPPENED IN A SITUATION WHERE 

1606
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:30,773
ONE INDIVIDUAL AT THIS POINT 

1607
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,643
APPEARS GUNNED DOWN. 

1608
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:34,344
SEVEN POLICE OFFICERS WERE 

1609
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,078
SHOT, ONE WAS KILLED. 

1610
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,312
WE WILL CHECK IN WITH DAVID 

1611
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:37,914
BEGNAUD AND HAVE A LOT MORE  

1612
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,549
POLITICS OUT OF WASHINGTON. 

1613
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,050
CHECK AROUND. 

1614
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,619
-- STICK AROUND. 

1615
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:28,891
>>> HI EVERYONE, I AM ANNE-

1616
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,893
MARIE GREEN.  

1617
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,094
>> AND I AM VLADIMIR DUTHIERS, 

1618
01:00:32,094 --> 01:00:33,863
THANKS FOR JOINING US.  

1619
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:41,804
SENATORS ARE REVIEWING THE 

1620
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,839
FBI'S NEW REPORT ON BRETT 

1621
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:43,940
KAVANAUGH IN A SECURE ROOM. 

1622
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,473
THE REPORT COMES AFTER 

1623
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:45,475
INVESTIGATORS LOOKED AT THE 

1624
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,876
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS MADE 

1625
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:47,910
AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT 

1626
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,311
NOMINEE. 

1627
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,545
IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE SENATE 

1628
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:50,546
OVERNIGHT AND NOW THAT REPORT 

1629
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:51,180
IS IN HAND. 

1630
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,549
A FINAL VOTE TO CONFIRM 

1631
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,085
KAVANAUGH  COULD HAPPEN AS SOON 

1632
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:56,686
AS SATURDAY. 

1633
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,187
>> ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET 

1634
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,556
JOURNAL, THE WHITE HOUSE SAW NO 

1635
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:01,257
CORROBORATION OF THE 

1636
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,792
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 

1637
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:06,529
DENIED BY THE NOMINEE. 

1638
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:07,363
ATTORNEYS FOR ONE OF 

1639
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:07,996
KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSERS, CHRISTINE 

1640
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:09,532
BLASEY FORD, SAYS THERE CLIENT 

1641
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:17,440
WAS NOT INTERVIEWED AND ACCUSED 

1642
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,374
THE INVESTIGATORS OF BEING 

1643
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,375
UNINTERESTED IN SEEKING THE 

1644
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:19,608
TRUTH. 

1645
01:01:19,608 --> 01:01:21,244
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS HE 

1646
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,645
HAS READY TO VOTE ON JUDGE 

1647
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:23,178
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION. 

1648
01:01:23,178 --> 01:01:24,781
HE MADE THE REMARK TO REPORTERS 

1649
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,516
ON CAPITOL HILL A SHORT WHILE 

1650
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:26,716
AGO. 

1651
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:31,921
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. 

1652
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,022
>> THE FBI IS DONE. 

1653
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,891
THEY INTERVIEWED 10 WITNESSES. 

1654
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:35,925
THEY FOLLOWED LEADS FROM 

1655
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:38,728
INTERVIEWS THAT MADE SENSE TO 

1656
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:39,328
ME. 

1657
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:44,433
IT IS A COMPLETE REPORT. 

1658
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:45,200
THERE IS A BACKGROUND CHECK. 

1659
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,270
úI 

1660
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,473
GOOD JOB. 

1661
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,707
THEY WERE NOT HINDERED IN ANY 

1662
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:51,907
WAY. 

1663
01:01:51,907 --> 01:01:53,443
THE FOCUS OF THE BACKGROUND 

1664
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,344
CHECK WAS ON CREDIBLE 

1665
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,112
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE THE 

1666
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:56,512
COMMITTEE. 

1667
01:01:56,512 --> 01:02:02,084
I WAS LOOKING FOR CERTAIN 

1668
01:02:02,084 --> 01:02:02,985
THINGS TO BE ANSWERED BY 

1669
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:03,285
WITNESSES. 

1670
01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:04,320
I AM MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER 

1671
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,555
THAT WHAT THE COMMITTEE FOUND 

1672
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:09,592
IS HELD UP, AND THEN SOME. 

1673
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,993
THE MAIN THING FOR ME IS THAT 

1674
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,562
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE FBI AND 

1675
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,363
YOU NEED TO ASK THEM, DID THEY 

1676
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,898
FEEL LIKE THEY WERE ABLE TO DO 

1677
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,932
THEIR JOB WITHOUT INTERFERENCE? 

1678
01:02:16,932 --> 01:02:22,171
I THINK THE ANSWER IS, YES. 

1679
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:22,771
THEY INTERVIEWED OVER 150 

1680
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:24,040
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF 

1681
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,477
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE. 

1682
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:29,478
TO THOSE WHO SUGGEST THAT HE 

1683
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:30,713
HAD A PROBLEM LIKE THIS FROM 

1684
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:31,714
PRIOR INTERVIEWS, THERE IS NO 

1685
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:32,515
EVIDENCE OF THAT. 

1686
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:36,318
THAT IS ALL MANUFACTURED. 

1687
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:37,220
THE SENATORS WHO REQUESTED THE 

1688
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:37,820
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 

1689
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,455
CHECK GOT WHAT THEY REQUESTED. 

1690
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:43,826
AND I AM READY TO VOTE. 

1691
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:44,760
>> Reporter: ARE YOU CONFIDENT 

1692
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,761
THAT THE SENATORS YOU MENTIONED 

1693
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:45,961
-- 

1694
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,964
>> YOU NEED TO TALK TO THEM. 

1695
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:54,771
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE 

1696
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,371
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 

1697
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,139
CHECK WAS DONE PROFESSIONALLY. 

1698
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,406
WAS DONE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. 

1699
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:58,741
AND IT VALIDATED, IN MY VIEW, 

1700
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:01,577
WHERE WE ARE. 

1701
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,346
BUT YOU NEED TO TALK TO THEM. 

1702
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:07,450
THE IDEA OF THE FBI LOOKING AT 

1703
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,284
THE COMMITTEE'S WORK PRODUCT 

1704
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:13,789
MADE SOME SENSE. 

1705
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:15,424
I DID NOT NEED IT, BUT IT IS 

1706
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:21,597
DONE AND IT PUTS A STAMP ON IT. 

1707
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,899
IT IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS 

1708
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:23,132
BEFORE. 

1709
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,667
WE NEED TO GO TO THESE THREE 

1710
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:25,968
WHO IN GOOD FAITH TRIED TO FIND 

1711
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,570
OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WHAT 

1712
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,239
IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY. 

1713
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,877
150+ PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

1714
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:38,114
INTERVIEWED. I HAVE PERSONALLY 

1715
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:38,948
KNOWN HIM FOR 20 YEARS. 

1716
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,383
NOT A CLOSE FRIEND, BUT A 

1717
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:40,950
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP. 

1718
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:41,817
THE BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT I KNEW 

1719
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:46,889
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS THE 

1720
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:47,924
BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT I KNOW 

1721
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:48,124
NOW. 

1722
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,325
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS AN 

1723
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:52,995
EFFORT TO RUIN THIS MAN'S LIFE. 

1724
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,430
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST HEARD 

1725
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:54,897
FROM SENATOR GRAHAM. 

1726
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:58,568
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO CBS LEGAL 

1727
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:04,540
ANALYST RICKY KLEEMAN. 

1728
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,541
ALL ALONG WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 

1729
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,776
ABOUT THIS OVER THE LAST COUPLE 

1730
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:14,383
OF DAYS, AS TO THIS FBI INQUIRY,

1731
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,651
WHICH IS NOT AN INVESTIGATION. 

1732
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:16,652
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUBPOENA 

1733
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:16,953
POWER. 

1734
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,788
THEY CAN'T COMPEL ANYONE TO 

1735
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:19,822
COME FORWARD. 

1736
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,223
>> THEY ARE TRYING TO COME TO A 

1737
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:22,892
CONCLUSION, THEY ARE JUST 

1738
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,895
PRESENTING INFORMATION. 

1739
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:26,295
>> RIGHT. 

1740
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,530
IT IS TO BE EXPECTED I GUESS 

1741
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,531
THAT SOME DEMOCRATS WILL SAY 

1742
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,966
THAT WHAT THEY SAW IN THE 

1743
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:30,600
REPORT SUGGESTS SOMETHING THAT 

1744
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,501
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING IS NOT 

1745
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,002
THERE. 

1746
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,870
>> I THINK YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY 

1747
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,005
RIGHT. 

1748
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:41,510
I THINK THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE 

1749
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,145
GONE TO THE BATTLEFIELD, IF YOU 

1750
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:47,783
WILL, AND THAT THEY WENT IN 

1751
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:48,650
BELIEVING ONE THING AND THEY 

1752
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,820
ARE COMING OUT BELIEVING THE 

1753
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,922
SAME THING. 

1754
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,657
IF YOU GO INTO SOMETHING AND 

1755
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,359
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 

1756
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,592
CONFIRMATION OF YOUR OWN 

1757
01:04:57,592 --> 01:05:02,865
BELIEFS, CERTAINLY THE 

1758
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,233
REPUBLICANS ARE EASILY ABLE TO 

1759
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,471
SAY, LOOK, DEMOCRATS WANTED 

1760
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:13,009
THIS INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI. 

1761
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:17,146
THEY GOT IT. 

1762
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,481
IT SHOWS NOTHING THAT WE DIDN'T 

1763
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:22,785
KNOW A WEEK AGO TODAY. 

1764
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,353
THE DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER HAND 

1765
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:28,157
ARE SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE. 

1766
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:29,358
THE INVESTIGATION WE GOT WAS 

1767
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,693
NOT THE ONE WE THOUGHT WE WERE 

1768
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:31,293
GOING TO GET. 

1769
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:32,695
SO THEIR POSITION HAS NOT 

1770
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,529
CHANGED. 

1771
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:34,897
ULTIMATELY WE ARE COMING DOWN 

1772
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,801
TO THE VOTES OF THREE SENATORS, 

1773
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,837
COLLINS, MURKOWSKI, AND FLAKE, 

1774
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,806
AND PERHAPS IN ADDITION TO JOE 

1775
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:50,846
MANCHIN, ANOTHER SENATOR ON THE 

1776
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:51,781
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, RUNNING IN A 

1777
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,415
RED STATE. 

1778
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:53,782
SO NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN A 

1779
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:59,121
WEEK. 

1780
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,456
IT IS JUST THAT THE STAKES SEEM 

1781
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,157
TO HAVE GOTTEN HIGHER. 

1782
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,792
>> THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS 

1783
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,893
THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT 

1784
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:04,827
THIS INVESTIGATION OR PROBE OR 

1785
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:05,461
ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECK 

1786
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,663
REALLY WAS ABOUT. 

1787
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:08,898
WE KNOW THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

1788
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:09,899
DETERMINED WHAT THE SCOPE OF IT 

1789
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:11,500
WAS GOING TO BE. 

1790
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,535
THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IT 

1791
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,971
WOULD BE LIMITED TO CHRISTINE 

1792
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:16,605
BLASEY FORD'S ACCUSATIONS, BUT 

1793
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:21,444
WE FOUND OUT THEY NEVER SPOKE 

1794
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:22,778
TO HER OR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT 

1795
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:26,315
THEY SPOKE TO ANOTHER ACCUSER 

1796
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,750
ABOUT HER ACCUSATIONS ABOUT HIM 

1797
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,784
EXPOSING HIMSELF AT A PARTY 

1798
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,820
WHILE THEY WERE STUDENTS AT 

1799
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,654
YALE. 

1800
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,555
THEN, ACCORDING TO HER, NEVER 

1801
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,957
SPOKE TO ANY OF HER WITNESSES. 

1802
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,292
THERE WERE NINE PEOPLE THE FBI 

1803
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:36,725
SPOKE TO. 

1804
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:38,294
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO THEY WOULD 

1805
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,930
BE, BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY 

1806
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,898
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE 

1807
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,868
LOOKING INTO. 

1808
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:46,869
>> THE THEORY WOULD'VE BEEN 

1809
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,270
THAT THEY WERE LOOKING INTO THE 

1810
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,472
ACCUSATIONS OF DOCTOR FORD AND 

1811
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,576
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS 

1812
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,579
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, WHICH 

1813
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,413
APPARENTLY THERE WAS NOT. 

1814
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,814
I DON'T SEE WHY ANYONE EXPECTED 

1815
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,616
THERE TO BE ON THE BASIS THAT 

1816
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:04,553
THE WITNESSES WHO DOCTOR FORD 

1817
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,654
HAD TALKED ABOUT WERE PEOPLE 

1818
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:09,225
WHO DID NOT REMEMBER THE EVENT. 

1819
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,426
THE FACT THAT THEY WENT ON TO 

1820
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,727
THE SECOND ACCUSER, DEBORAH 

1821
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:15,831
RAMIREZ, WHICH I THINK THEY 

1822
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:16,832
SHOULD HAVE DONE, BUT THEY 

1823
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:17,933
SHOULD HAVE GONE ON TO THE 

1824
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:18,767
THIRD ACCUSER, JULIE SWETNICK. 

1825
01:07:18,767 --> 01:07:20,169
NO MATTER WHAT THE PRESIDENT OR 

1826
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:20,970
OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT HER, 

1827
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,807
JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR. 

1828
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,442
THE BEST THING ABOUT AN FBI 

1829
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,042
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION IS 

1830
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:34,550
THAT IT SHOULD FIND NOTHING 

1831
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,617
THAT WOULD PREVENT SOMEONE FROM 

1832
01:07:35,617 --> 01:07:36,418
BECOMING A SUPREME COURT 

1833
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:37,553
JUSTICE OR A FEDERAL COURT 

1834
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:38,621
JUDGE, WHICH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

1835
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,524
ALREADY IS. 

1836
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:42,892
IF ANYONE SHOULD WELCOME THE 

1837
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,262
FBI INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD 

1838
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,096
HAVE BEEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IF 

1839
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:49,331
JUDGE KAVANAUGH REALLY BELIEVED 

1840
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,666
THAT IT WOULD SHOW THAT HE HAD 

1841
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,067
NOTHING TO HIDE AND THAT HE WAS 

1842
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:58,541
WELL QUALIFIED TO TAKE THIS JOB 

1843
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,575
AND NO ONE WOULD SAY ANYTHING 

1844
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,676
DIFFERENT THAN THAT, BY VIRTUE 

1845
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,811
OF CORROBORATING ANY OF THESE 

1846
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:03,312
WOMEN. 

1847
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,747
BUT I ASSUME, THOUGH I HATE TO 

1848
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:09,351
SAY THIS, I ASSUME WE ARE GOING 

1849
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,953
TO FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT WHAT 

1850
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:11,654
HAPPENED IN THE FBI 

1851
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:12,955
INVESTIGATION, BECAUSE NO 

1852
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:18,294
MATTER WHAT EFFORTS THE 

1853
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:19,495
INSTRUCTIONS ARE, TO BE ABLE TO 

1854
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,729
KEEP THIS ALL CONFIDENTIAL, THE 

1855
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:23,165
IDEA OF ONE COPY. 

1856
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,334
THE IDEA THAT IT CAN'T BE 

1857
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:25,567
SHARED. 

1858
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:29,104
THE IDEA OF HAVING SENATORS 

1859
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:30,538
READ IT, ONE BY ONE OR IN 

1860
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:34,076
GROUPS, IN ORDER TO NOT HAVE 

1861
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:35,678
ANYTHING ABOUT IT GO OUT INTO 

1862
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,613
THE PUBLIC. 

1863
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:42,917
I DO BELIEVE THAT I MAY WORK 

1864
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:47,656
FOR CBS NEWS AS A LEGAL 

1865
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:48,490
ANALYST, BUT I CERTAINLY 

1866
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:53,696
BELIEVE, BOTH AS A LAWYER AND 

1867
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:54,729
IN THE WORLD OF JOURNALISM, 

1868
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:55,965
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT 

1869
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,865
SHOULD NOT BE LEAKED. 

1870
01:08:56,865 --> 01:08:59,301
I KNOW THAT MAYBE CONTRARY TO 

1871
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,935
WHAT SOME MEDIA MAY WANT, BUT I 

1872
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:04,974
DO HAVE A STRONG FEELING ABOUT 

1873
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:05,207
LEAKS. 

1874
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:06,475
YOU KNOW THIS WILL GET LEAKED. 

1875
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,143
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND 

1876
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:09,745
ABOUT IT. 

1877
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,313
>> ALL RIGHT, WE WILL CHECK IN 

1878
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,883
WITH YOU IN JUST A BIT, BECAUSE 

1879
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:15,984
I THINK WE HAVE SENATOR CORY 

1880
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:16,886
BOOKER MAKING SOME COMMENTS 

1881
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:17,386
ABOUT THIS. 

1882
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:17,719
LET'S LISTEN. 

1883
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:21,055
>> THE PERSON MAKING AN 

1884
01:09:21,055 --> 01:09:22,057
ALLEGATION HAS GIVEN YOU A LIST 

1885
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,826
OF PEOPLE THAT EITHER SAW THAT 

1886
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,962
WORK COULD CORROBORATE WHAT SHE 

1887
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:27,328
SAID. 

1888
01:09:27,328 --> 01:09:28,796
DID YOU INTERVIEW ALL OF THOSE 

1889
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:31,867
PEOPLE? 

1890
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,035
IF THE ANSWER IS NO, WHAT KIND 

1891
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,502
OF INVESTIGATION IS THIS? 

1892
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:36,839
THEY ALWAYS HAD THE NUMBERS. 

1893
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:42,711
TO RAM THIS THROUGH. 

1894
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:43,345
CLEARLY THAT SEEMS LIKE WHAT 

1895
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,979
THEY WILL NOW TRY TO DO AND I 

1896
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:45,881
HOPE THAT PEOPLE OF GOOD 

1897
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:46,615
CONSCIENCE ASK THE SAME 

1898
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:49,984
QUESTIONS I AM ASKING, WHICH IS,

1899
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:51,187
WHY DIDN'T YOU COMPLETE THIS 

1900
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:51,554
INVESTIGATION? 

1901
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:52,688
WHY DIDN'T YOU INTERVIEW 

1902
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:56,892
RELATIVE TO -- INTERVIEW THE 

1903
01:09:56,892 --> 01:10:00,663
RELEVANT PEOPLE TO THIS? 

1904
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:02,298
>> OKAY, SO SENATOR CORY BOOKER 

1905
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:12,107
WAS BASICALLY ASKING THE PRESS, 

1906
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,208
BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT WILL BE 

1907
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,310
PLAYED ACROSS ALL MEDIA OUTLETS 

1908
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,644
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS, 

1909
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:16,978
THE QUESTION THAT HE WANTS OUT 

1910
01:10:16,978 --> 01:10:17,212
THERE. 

1911
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:17,946
THAT IS, WHY ISN'T THIS 

1912
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:18,714
INVESTIGATION MORE THOROUGH? 

1913
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,515
TO USE THE LANGUAGE THE 

1914
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:23,085
DEMOCRATS ARE USING. 

1915
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,219
WHY DIDN'T THEY INTERVIEW MORE 

1916
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:24,519
WITNESSES? 

1917
01:10:24,519 --> 01:10:25,554
WE KNOW THEY INTERVIEWED 

1918
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,691
DEBORAH RAMIREZ, BUT THEY DID 

1919
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:29,491
NOT INTERVIEW THE PEOPLE SHE 

1920
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:30,326
SAYS COULD CORROBORATE HER 

1921
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,327
VERSION OF THE ALLEGATION THAT 

1922
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,897
SHE HAS MADE. 

1923
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,498
WHY? 

1924
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:37,733
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW WHY. 

1925
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:38,634
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR 

1926
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:39,067
INSTRUCTIONS WERE. 

1927
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,236
THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. 

1928
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:46,275
THE FBI, WHICH I HAVE ENORMOUS 

1929
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:49,978
RESPECT FOR. 

1930
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:53,349
I GO BACK FOR THE 20 YEARS I 

1931
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,750
PRACTICED LAW ON BOTH SIDES, AS 

1932
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,486
A PROSECUTOR AND A DEFENDER, I 

1933
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:04,126
HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR THE 

1934
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,527
FBI AND ALSO FOR THE LENGTHY 

1935
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,462
PERIOD OF TIME I HAVE BEEN 

1936
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:09,598
COVERING CASES INVOLVING THEM. 

1937
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,133
YES, WE HAVE SEEN THE FBI IN 

1938
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,468
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, UNDER 

1939
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,870
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY 

1940
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,639
CRITICISM, SOME OF IT FOR GOOD 

1941
01:11:17,639 --> 01:11:18,807
REASON AND OTHERS NOT SO GOOD, 

1942
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:22,411
AND WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK, I 

1943
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,046
BELIEVE, SOME POINT, 

1944
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,749
CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS. 

1945
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:27,950
CHRISTOPHER WRAY WILL HAVE TO 

1946
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:32,054
COME DOWN AND EXPLAIN WHY HIS 

1947
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,155
AGENTS DID WHAT THEY WERE TOLD, 

1948
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:36,125
I ASSUME, AND DID NOT GO BEYOND 

1949
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,493
THE SCOPE OF WHAT THEIR 

1950
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:42,197
INSTRUCTIONS WERE. 

1951
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:43,332
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, ONE OF 

1952
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,233
THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE FORGET 

1953
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,603
IS THAT THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 

1954
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:47,970
INVESTIGATION. 

1955
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,305
THIS IS A BACKGROUND 

1956
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:50,873
INVESTIGATION. 

1957
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:56,812
THE TWO ARE VERY, VERY DIFFERENT

1958
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,413
IN SCOPE. 

1959
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,447
WHATEVER THE SCOPE IS IN THIS 

1960
01:11:58,447 --> 01:11:59,448
ONE, WE DON'T KNOW. 

1961
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,116
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS VERY 

1962
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:05,921
NARROW, DESPITE A LOT OF REPORTS

1963
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,089
IN THE MEDIA THAT IT LOOKED 

1964
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:10,793
LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE BIG OR 

1965
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,561
THAT CERTAINLY YOU AND I AND 

1966
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,897
ALL OF OUR VIEWERS WERE 

1967
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,965
LISTENING FROM TIME TO TIME AS 

1968
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,767
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE FBI WAS 

1969
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,202
UNFETTERED TO DO WHATEVER IT 

1970
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:20,703
NEEDED TO DO. 

1971
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,939
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE FBI 

1972
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:28,477
WAS VERY CIRCUMSCRIBED, HERE. 

1973
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:29,511
THAT IS, IT WAS ONLY SUPPOSED 

1974
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,146
TO SEE CERTAIN PEOPLE UP TO A 

1975
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:31,546
CERTAIN POINT. 

1976
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:33,315
I WANT TO MAKE ONE LAST POINT 

1977
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,417
ON THIS. 

1978
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,718
THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE, 

1979
01:12:36,718 --> 01:12:38,821
INCLUDING THE ATTORNEYS FOR 

1980
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,922
DOCTOR FORD, WHO ARE IN THE 

1981
01:12:40,922 --> 01:12:46,295
WORLD OF SAYING, OF COURSE THIS 

1982
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,696
WAS ALL ABOUT DOCTOR FORD'S 

1983
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,031
ALLEGATIONS AND THEY DID NOT 

1984
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,301
EVEN GO SEE HER. 

1985
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,302
WELL, I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID 

1986
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:54,837
NOT GO SEE HER. 

1987
01:12:54,837 --> 01:13:02,778
SHE HAD TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS, 

1988
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:03,746
AND TO THE WORLD, IF YOU WILL, 

1989
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:08,917
FOR MANY HOURS LAST THURSDAY 

1990
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,252
AND THERE WAS HER LETTER AND 

1991
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:10,652
OTHER STATEMENTS. 

1992
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:13,922
THEY HAD A LOT FROM DOCTOR FORD.

1993
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,257
THE QUESTION REALLY WAS, TO ME, 

1994
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,626
WHY DIDN'T THEY GO SEE BRETT 

1995
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:18,694
KAVANAUGH AFTER THEY GOT 

1996
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:22,898
WHATEVER THEY GOT FROM OTHER 

1997
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,600
WITNESSES. THAT THEY DID NEED 

1998
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,368
TO GO VISIT BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 

1999
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,103
INTERVIEW HIM AT THE END. 

2000
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,637
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE TO 

2001
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:31,773
ME. 

2002
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:32,975
GOING BACK TO DOCTOR FORD, I 

2003
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:36,645
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID NOT. 

2004
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:37,946
>> SO WE KNOW SENATORS ARE NOT 

2005
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:42,217
SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THE 

2006
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,385
CONTENTS OF THE DOCUMENT, BUT 

2007
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,686
AS WE MOE FORWARD TOWARD THE 

2008
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,021
SMOKE, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 

2009
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,589
SPEECHMAKING, PERHAPS A LITTLE 

2010
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:51,693
GRANDSTANDING. 

2011
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:52,828
WHAT SORT OF RISK WOULD 

2012
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,897
SENATORS FACE IF, PERHAPS IN A 

2013
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:56,498
PARTICULARLY PASSIONATE SPEECH, 

2014
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,167
THEY RELEASED INFORMATION THAT 

2015
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,169
WAS IN THIS DOCUMENT? 

2016
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:02,438
>> THEY HAVE AN ETHICAL AND 

2017
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,172
LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT 

2018
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:05,474
RELEASE WHAT IS IN THAT 

2019
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:05,774
DOCUMENT. 

2020
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,209
AND THEY KNOW THAT. 

2021
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,879
DO I EXPECT SOME SENATORS TO BE 

2022
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:14,283
PROSECUTED FOR LEAKING THIS 

2023
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:14,616
INFORMATION? 

2024
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:15,150
HIGHLY UNLIKELY. 

2025
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:20,455
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT YOU 

2026
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,024
OUGHT TO ACT ACCORDING TO YOUR 

2027
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:22,891
ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES. 

2028
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:28,363
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, RIKKI 

2029
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,064
KLIEMAN, WE APPRECIATE YOU 

2030
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:29,665
TALKING TO US. 

2031
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:34,870
WE WILL PROBABLY  TAP INTO YOUR 

2032
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:35,837
EXPERTISE IN THE FUTURE. 

2033
01:14:35,837 --> 01:14:36,137
THANK YOU. 

2034
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:39,308
>> OKAY, I AM READY. 

2035
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:44,880
>> THE FBI INVESTIGATION MAY BE 

2036
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,214
OVER, BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT 

2037
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:53,956
ANNE-MARIE, THERE WILL BE  A 

2038
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:54,789
LOT OF GRANDSTANDING ON BOTH 

2039
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:55,791
SIDES OF THE AISLE. 

2040
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,025
I THINK FOR FOLKS OUT THERE WHO 

2041
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,226
ARE NOT IN THE BUBBLE, THE 

2042
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,528
MEDIA BUBBLE OR THE WASHINGTON 

2043
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:00,762
BUBBLE, THE ONE THING I HOPE WE 

2044
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,197
DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF IS THAT 

2045
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,498
THERE IS A WOMAN WHO SAYS 

2046
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:04,065
SOMETHING REALLY TERRIBLE 

2047
01:15:04,065 --> 01:15:12,007
HAPPENED TO HER BACK IN 1982 

2048
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:12,808
AND TWO SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY'S 

2049
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,242
POINT, THERE IS A MAN WHO SAYS 

2050
01:15:14,242 --> 01:15:15,344
HE HAS BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED, 

2051
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,678
BUT HIS ENTIRE FAMILY HAS GONE 

2052
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:17,579
THROUGH THIS ORDEAL WITH HIM. 

2053
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:18,947
IT WILL REQUIRE FOLKS TO TAKE A 

2054
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:22,084
STEP BACK AND REASSESS A LOT OF 

2055
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,519
THINGS BUT I HOPE THAT IS NOT 

2056
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,053
LOST IN ALL OF THIS. 

2057
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:25,687
YOU KNOW, GAMESMANSHIP. 

2058
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,590
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. 

2059
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,925
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE, THE 

2060
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,660
MIDTERMS, ALL THAT STUFF. 

2061
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,961
THE WHITE HOUSE DOES SAY THAT 

2062
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:36,632
IT DOES HAVE THE VOTES. 

2063
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:37,633
IT IS CONFIDENT THAT IT DOES 

2064
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,034
HAVE THE VOTES TO CONFIRM BRETT 

2065
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:39,868
KAVANAUGH TO THE SUPREME COURT, 

2066
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,770
AFTER REVIEWING THAT FBI REPORT.

2067
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,071
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? 

2068
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:46,141
THERE IS A TWEET. 

2069
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:47,142
THE PRESIDENT IN A TWEET 

2070
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:51,813
EARLIER TODAY WROTE THIS. 

2071
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:52,848
THE HARSH, UNFAIR TREATMENT OF 

2072
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:53,749
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS HAVING 

2073
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:58,787
AN INCREDIBLE UPWARD IMPACT ON 

2074
01:15:58,787 --> 01:15:59,988
VOTERS. 

2075
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:01,189
THE PEOPLE GET IT FAR BETTER 

2076
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,689
THAN THE POLITICIANS. 

2077
01:16:01,689 --> 01:16:02,424
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS GREAT 

2078
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:03,625
LIFE CANNOT BE RUINED BY MEAN 

2079
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,260
AND DESPICABLE DEMOCRATS AND 

2080
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:05,760
TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED 

2081
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,094
ALLEGATIONS. 

2082
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:13,602
>> THE SINGLE DOCUMENT WAS 

2083
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:14,303
DELIVERED OVERNIGHT TO THE 

2084
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:14,536
SENATE. 

2085
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:15,804
THE FINAL VOTE IS PLANNED FOR 

2086
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:16,071
SATURDAY. 

2087
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,272
ALL 100 SENATORS AND A HANDFUL 

2088
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,540
OF STAFF HAVE BEGUN TO REVIEW 

2089
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:18,840
THE REPORT. 

2090
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,841
WE HAVE MORE ON THE RESPONSE 

2091
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,476
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 

2092
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,578
THE PRESS SECRETARY SAYS THAT 

2093
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:30,919
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 

2094
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:31,987
BEEN TALKING TO SENATORS WHO 

2095
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:32,888
REMAIN ON THE FENCE. 

2096
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:33,922
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 

2097
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:34,489
THOSE CONVERSATIONS? 

2098
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:35,524
>> Reporter: HE SAYS THE WHITE 

2099
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,759
HOUSE HAS BEEN IN VERY CLOSE 

2100
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,460
CONTACT WITH THESE SENATORS, 

2101
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,961
LOBBYING THEM, TRYING TO TALK 

2102
01:16:39,961 --> 01:16:42,831
TO THEM MORE ABOUT THE FACTS 

2103
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:43,966
AND NOT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER 

2104
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:47,001
NOISE THAT HAS IMPACTED THIS 

2105
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:47,468
CONFIRMATION HEARING. 

2106
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:48,704
THERE CERTAINLY IS A LOT OF 

2107
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:49,705
THAT. 

2108
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:53,575
AND RAJ SHAH, EVEN THOUGH HE 

2109
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:59,581
EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT 

2110
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:00,582
SENATORS CAN VOTE COMFORTABLY, 

2111
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:01,583
THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN A TALLY OF 

2112
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:02,550
THE VOTES SINCE THIS REPORT 

2113
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,486
CAME OUT, SO THEY CAN'T SAY FOR 

2114
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:05,887
SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE MAGIC 

2115
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:06,822
NUMBER THEY NEED TO PUSH THIS 

2116
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:07,422
JUDGE THROUGH. 

2117
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:08,423
HE SAYS BASED ON THE FINDINGS 

2118
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:11,793
OF THIS REPORT, THAT HE SEES NO 

2119
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:15,130
REASON WHY THOSE GOP SENATORS 

2120
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,798
WOULD NOT VOTE YES. 

2121
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,467
WE PRESSED HIM ABOUT WHY? 

2122
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,501
WHY ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT? 

2123
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:26,675
WHAT DID THE FINDINGS TELL US 

2124
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,110
AND WILL YOU SHARE THAT WITH 

2125
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:28,810
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC? 

2126
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,711
HE WAS VERY GUARDED TO SAY 

2127
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:30,879
THERE ARE PRIVACY ACTS IN 

2128
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:31,747
PLACE, RULES IN PLACE THAT 

2129
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,181
PREVENT HIM FROM TALKING TOO 

2130
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,016
MUCH AND CHARACTERIZING WHAT 

2131
01:17:35,016 --> 01:17:36,684
THE FBI HAS FOUND, BUT HE 

2132
01:17:36,684 --> 01:17:41,556
MAINTAINS, TAKE IT FROM HIM, 

2133
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:42,758
THEY DID NOT FIND SOMETHING 

2134
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:46,895
THAT SHOULD CAUSE WORRY FOR THE 

2135
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:51,199
PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THIS HUGE 

2136
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:51,466
DECISION. 

2137
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:52,701
>> THAT IS THE LAST THING A 

2138
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,935
FREE AND FAIR PRESS WILL EVER 

2139
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:57,773
DO, JUST TAKE IT AT THE WORD OF 

2140
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:58,773
A WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY. 

2141
01:17:58,773 --> 01:17:59,808
IS THIS CONSIDERED STANDARD NOT 

2142
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:02,878
TO RELEASE THIS INFORMATION TO 

2143
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,880
THE PUBLIC? 

2144
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,580
>> Reporter: IT IS. 

2145
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,481
EVEN THOUGH THIS BACKGROUND 

2146
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:07,315
INFORMATION IS NOT MARKED AS 

2147
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,017
TOP-SECRET OR CLASSIFIED, IT IS 

2148
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,786
CUSTOMARY FOR IT TO REMAIN 

2149
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,220
CONFIDENTIAL. 

2150
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:16,057
SO, IN THE FUTURE, THIS PROCESS 

2151
01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:16,491
CAN CONTINUE. 

2152
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:17,492
IT IS A LONG PROCESS. 

2153
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,328
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY OTHER 

2154
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:24,399
NOMINEES, IN ORDER TO GET TO 

2155
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,568
THE HEART OF WHAT KIND OF JUDGE 

2156
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:27,235
THEY WOULD BE. 

2157
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,403
HOW THEY WOULD SERVE. 

2158
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:33,108
JUST BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING TO 

2159
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:33,909
OFFICIALLY BECOME PUBLIC DOES 

2160
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,710
NOT MEAN WE DO NOT EXPECT TO 

2161
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:39,815
SEE IT. 

2162
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:41,416
SO, IF THERE ARE LEAKS, THAT IS 

2163
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:42,450
CERTAINLY ONE WAY, THE ONLY WAY 

2164
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:43,084
THAT WE WILL. 

2165
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:44,319
THAT IS NOT OUT OF THE 

2166
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,086
QUESTION. 

2167
01:18:45,086 --> 01:18:46,955
IN FACT, I PREDICT WE WILL BE 

2168
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:47,489
SEEING THAT. 

2169
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:50,759
THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A 

2170
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:54,262
CONTENTIOUS PROCESS, THAT 

2171
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,497
THOSE, ESPECIALLY IN FAVOR OF 

2172
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,899
CAVANAGH, WILL WANT THE PUBLIC 

2173
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,367
TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FBI 

2174
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:03,671
FOUND AND THOSE SENATORS, 

2175
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:04,606
PERHAPS YOU END UP VOTING YES, 

2176
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,074
WILL WANT TO JUSTIFY THEIR 

2177
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:11,479
DECISION. 

2178
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:12,514
>> THAT IS THE POINT. 

2179
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:13,415
IT MAY NOT BE STANDARD 

2180
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:14,649
PROCEDURE TO RELEASE IT TO THE 

2181
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:17,219
PUBLIC, BUT WHOEVER LEAKS, IT 

2182
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,453
IS GOING TO BE SELF-SERVING, SO 

2183
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:19,821
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD NEVER 

2184
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,691
REALLY KNOW. 

2185
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:23,525
>> THIS LIMITED EXPOSURE TO 

2186
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:24,926
THIS DOCUMENT IS AN ATTEMPT TO 

2187
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:29,297
LIMIT THE LEAKS, BUT SENATOR 

2188
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:30,198
GRASSLEY ALREADY RELEASED A 

2189
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,133
STATEMENT AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE 

2190
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:34,870
WILL TRY TO ISSUE A REBUTTAL. 

2191
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,571
I WILL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF 

2192
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,272
LINES OUT OF GRASSLEY'S 

2193
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:38,874
STATEMENT, WHICH IS, THERE IS 

2194
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:41,977
NOTHING IN IT WE DIDN'T ALREADY 

2195
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:42,177
KNOW. 

2196
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:42,644
THESE UNCORROBORATED 

2197
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:46,848
ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN 

2198
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:48,650
UNEQUIVOCALLY AND REPEATEDLY 

2199
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:49,717
REJECTED BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

2200
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:50,518
NEITHER THE COMMITTEE NOR THE 

2201
01:19:50,518 --> 01:19:53,622
FBI COULD LOCATE ANY THIRD 

2202
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,590
PARTIES WHO COULD ATTEST TO ANY 

2203
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,224
OF THE ALLEGATIONS. 

2204
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:57,792
SO, A LITTLE WINDOW INTO WHAT 

2205
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:03,431
THAT DOCUMENT MIGHT SAY. 

2206
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,633
I AM SURE THERE WILL BE AT 

2207
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,767
LEAST ONE LEAK ON THE OTHER 

2208
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:06,902
SIDE, RESPONDING. 

2209
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:07,802
>> YOU THINK? 

2210
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:09,170
>> Reporter: A LEAK AND ALSO 

2211
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,205
PUSHBACK BY THE DEMOCRATS WHO 

2212
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:14,042
SAY IT IS UNFAIR FOR YOU TO 

2213
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:14,776
DRAW THIS CONCLUSION, BECAUSE 

2214
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:15,477
THEY WILL ARGUE THIS 

2215
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,278
INVESTIGATION WAS UNFAIR, 

2216
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:20,749
BECAUSE IT WAS SO LIMITED IN 

2217
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:21,349
TIME AND SCOPE. 

2218
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:22,817
IN FACT THERE WAS A NEW ARTICLE 

2219
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:29,224
THAT DROPPED IN THE NEW YORKER 

2220
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:30,125
THAT SAID THERE WERE SEVERAL 

2221
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,359
PEOPLE WHO CONTACTED THE FBI, 

2222
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:32,060
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO 

2223
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:32,694
CORROBORATE THAT SECOND 

2224
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:34,796
ACCUSERS STORY, BUT THEY WERE 

2225
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,831
NEVER CONTACTED IN RETURN. 

2226
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:37,966
SO THEY COULD NOT SHARE THE 

2227
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,502
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD. 

2228
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,670
SO, I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL 

2229
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,139
BE A MARK, BECAUSE THE 

2230
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:44,940
DEMOCRATS WILL CONTINUE TO SAY, 

2231
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,875
EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT OF 

2232
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,811
FOUND CORROBORATION, THAT IS 

2233
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:54,683
BECAUSE THE PROCESS WAS UNFAIR 

2234
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,150
AND YOU DID NOT LOOK FOR IT IN 

2235
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,552
THE WAY WE WOULD'VE WANTED YOU 

2236
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:57,718
TO. 

2237
01:20:57,718 --> 01:20:59,621
ONE THING ASIDE, ONE THING THAT 

2238
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:02,924
ROZ SHAW DID ACKNOWLEDGE, HE 

2239
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,826
DOES SAY THAT HE DOES BELIEVE 

2240
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,895
THIS WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT 

2241
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:10,265
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S REPUTATION 

2242
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:11,466
AND HIS SERVICE ON THE COURT. 

2243
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:12,801
HE SAID IT WAS AN UGLY PROCESS 

2244
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,803
AND HE WORRIES THIS COULD 

2245
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:18,239
JEOPARDIZE OTHER NOMINEES IN 

2246
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,474
THE FUTURE AND WHAT THEY MAY 

2247
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:23,011
HAVE TO GO THROUGH. 

2248
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:23,745
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT REGARDLESS 

2249
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:25,880
OF THE OUTCOME, THIS WILL BE A 

2250
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:32,687
CHAPTER IN HISTORY THAT REALLY 

2251
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:33,521
DEFINES THE PRESIDENT'S LEGACY, 

2252
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:35,390
IN TERMS OF SETTING THE COURT. 

2253
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:40,428
>> YOU KNOW, -- 

2254
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:41,229
>> AND THE PROCESS. 

2255
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,430
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT 

2256
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,565
THE PROCESS AND SAID, THIS IS 

2257
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:44,566
AN IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR 

2258
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:44,832
COUNTRY. 

2259
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:45,700
DUE PROCESS AND COMMON SENSE 

2260
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,901
ARE NOW IN TRIAL. 

2261
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:51,139
I KNOW THAT YOU AND OTHER -- 

2262
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:51,840
ARE NOW ON TRIAL. 

2263
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,174
I KNOW THAT YOU AND OTHER PRESS 

2264
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:57,445
CORPS MEMBERS HAVE PRESSED 

2265
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:58,246
SARAH SANDERS AND THE 

2266
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:58,880
ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND 

2267
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,884
WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A 

2268
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:07,622
DIFFERENT STANDARD WHEN HE WAS 

2269
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:08,289
A PRIVATE CITIZEN, SPECIFICALLY 

2270
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:09,457
WHEN IT CAME TO THE CENTRAL 

2271
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,959
PARK FIVE, AND WHY HE SEEMS TO 

2272
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:12,460
HAVE A MUCH DIFFERENT STANDARD 

2273
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,529
AS PRESIDENT. 

2274
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:15,764
I KNOW YOU WILL KEEP DIGGING ON 

2275
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,065
THAT, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS 

2276
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:18,099
RELEVANT TO THE DISCUSSIONS WE 

2277
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:18,800
ARE HAVING NOW. 

2278
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,235
THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW. 

2279
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:21,236
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SENATE 

2280
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:22,137
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THE 

2281
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:30,445
STANDARDS ARE NOT THE SAME AS 

2282
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:32,080
IT WOULD BE IN A COURT OF LAW, 

2283
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,014
AND THE PRESIDENT IS TWEETING 

2284
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:34,616
AS IF IT SHOULD BE, MIXING UP 

2285
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,717
POLITICAL AND LEGAL TERMS ALL 

2286
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:36,051
AT ONCE. 

2287
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:37,285
THERE IS A HISTORY THERE THAT 

2288
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,119
HAS TO BE EXAMINED. 

2289
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,455
WEIJIA, WE APPRECIATE IT  AS 

2290
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:40,755
ALWAYS. 

2291
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:41,556
>> SURE, THANK YOU. 

2292
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:45,627
>>> HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN 

2293
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:46,828
ANOTHER AREA OF THE CAPITAL, 

2294
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:49,164
THIS IS THE DC DISTRICT COURT. 

2295
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:49,697
PROTESTERS HAVE AMASSED. 

2296
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:50,965
WE SHOULD CALL THEM 

2297
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:53,735
DEMONSTRATORS, BECAUSE THERE 

2298
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:54,802
ARE MANY PEOPLE AGAINST THE 

2299
01:22:54,802 --> 01:23:00,008
APPOINTMENT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

2300
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:01,343
AND THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE THAT 

2301
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,444
ARE SUPPORTERS IN THE CROWD. 

2302
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:03,878
THEIR PLAN IS TO START HERE AND 

2303
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:05,447
THEN MARCH TOWARD THE SUPREME 

2304
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:05,680
COURT. 

2305
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,950
WE HEARD, MAYBE 30 SECONDS AGO, 

2306
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:13,855
SOME OF THEM YELLING SHAME TO 

2307
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:14,122
SOMEONE. 

2308
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:15,390
WE ALSO HEARD A HEATED BACK AND 

2309
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,858
FORTH GOING ON BETWEEN A 

2310
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:20,562
SUPPORTER OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

2311
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,162
AND SOMEONE AGAINST HIM. 

2312
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,597
>> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 

2313
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,332
PEOPLE, AS YOU POINTED OUT, 

2314
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,333
THAT ARE SUPPORTERS OF JUDGE 

2315
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,134
KAVANAUGH AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

2316
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:30,772
I SAW HIM ON -- I SAW ONE MAN 

2317
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:36,577
ARGUING WITH A TRUMP T-SHIRT 

2318
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:36,777
ON. 

2319
01:23:36,777 --> 01:23:38,713
THE DISCUSSION APPEARED CORDIAL.

2320
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,583
WE COULD NOT HEAR IT OVER OUR 

2321
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,184
EARPIECES, BUT IT APPEARED 

2322
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,519
CORDIAL, WHICH IS PART OF HOW 

2323
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,654
DEBATES IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE 

2324
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:47,054
ALWAYS OCCURRED. 

2325
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:50,892
PEOPLE HAVE OPPOSING SIDES AND 

2326
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:52,460
HOPEFULLY IT STAYS ORDERLY AND 

2327
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,060
RESPECTFUL AND PEOPLE ARE 

2328
01:23:53,060 --> 01:24:02,770
RESPECTFUL OF EACH OTHER'S 

2329
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:03,671
POINTS OF VIEW AND OPINIONS. 

2330
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,006
THAT IS THE SCENE RIGHT NOW. 

2331
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,241
AS YOU POINTED OUT, THEY WILL 

2332
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:07,041
WALK TO THE SUPREME COURT. 

2333
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:08,276
THAT IS THE PLAN AS THEY 

2334
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:08,977
CONTINUE TO AMASS. 

2335
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,278
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE OUTSIDE THE 

2336
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:10,811
FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT. 

2337
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:12,580
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS 

2338
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,383
DEMONSTRATION AS WE LOOK AHEAD 

2339
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:16,484
TO THIS WEEKEND, WHERE WE 

2340
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,252
BELIEVE A CONFIRMATION VOTE FOR 

2341
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:18,153
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, DEPENDING ON 

2342
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:21,256
HOW THOSE KEY SENATORS -- 

2343
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,791
COLLINS, FLAKE, MURKOWSKI -- 

2344
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:28,796
HOW THEY ARE REACTING TO THIS 

2345
01:24:28,796 --> 01:24:30,231
NEW FBI REPORT THAT ONLY THE 

2346
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,232
SENATORS AND KEY STAFF MEMBERS 

2347
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:33,468
CAN HAVE ACCESS TO. 

2348
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:34,769
WE KNOW SENATOR COLLINS HAS 

2349
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,670
SAID IT IS VERY THOROUGH. 

2350
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,305
>>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A 

2351
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:37,705
BREAK. 

2352
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,793
>>> THERE IS MOUNTING 

2353
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:44,299
DEVASTATION IN INDONESIA, WHERE 

2354
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:45,700
MORE THAN 1420 PEOPLE HAVE DIED 

2355
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,868
FOLLOWING LAST FRIDAY'S

01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,349
OVER THE DISASTER ZONE. 

2381
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:35,483
THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN HERE WITH 

2382
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:38,786
HER 1-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER FOR SIX 

2383
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:43,991
DAYS. 

2384
01:27:43,991 --> 01:27:45,126
A TENT IS THEIR ONLY PROTECTION 

2385
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:46,027
FROM 90 DEGREE HEAT. 

2386
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:47,161
THEY HAVE HAD TO DRINK WATER 

2387
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,296
FROM THE NEARBY RIVER, WHICH IS 

2388
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:49,497

>> Reporter: DO YOU HAVE ANY 

2390
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:52,133
IDEA HOW LONG YOU WILL BE HERE?

SHE SAYS, I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO 

2392
01:27:53,634 --> 01:27:53,968
GO. 

2393
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:57,605
I NO LONGER HAVE A HOME. 

2394
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,207
HER HOME WAS WIPED OUT BY THE 

2395
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,141
TSUNAMI, TRIGGERED BY THE 7.5 

2396

FRIDAY. 

2398
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:04,278
THE SCARS ON HER FACE ARE FROM 

2399
01:28:04,278 --> 01:28:05,579
BEING ROLLED BY THE TSUNAMI 

2400
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:07,849
WAVES. 

2401
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,650
SHE SAYS, IT IS A MIRACLE THAT 

2402
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:12,954
WE FOUND HER ALIVE. 

2403
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,389
I THANK GOD THAT SHE HAS A NEW 

2404
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:14,589
LIFE. 

2405
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:17,625
WHILE WE WERE AT THE HOMELESS 

2406
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:26,667
CAMP, WE ALSO SAW THIS MAN 

2407
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:27,668
WALKING AROUND, WEARING A SIGN. 

2408
01:28:27,668 --> 01:28:28,703
IT BASICALLY SAYS, I AM LOOKING 

2409
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,904
FOR MY WIFE AND SON. 

2410
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,305
HE TOLD ME HE HAS NOT SEEN 

2411
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:32,240
EITHER OF THEM SINCE THE 

2412
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,141
EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED SIX DAYS 

2413
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:33,341
AGO. 

2414
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:34,342
HE IS HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT 

2415
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:35,576
THEY MAY STILL BE ALIVE. 

2416
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:36,577
BUT THIS IS WHAT HIS 

2417
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:37,511
NEIGHBORHOOD NOW LOOKS LIKE. 

2418
01:28:37,511 --> 01:28:38,313
EVERY SINGLE HOME REDUCE THE 

2419
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,248
PILES OF CHARRED DEBRIS. 

2420
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:41,482
WE ARE TOLD MORE THAN 700 HOMES 

2421
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:42,883
WERE DESTROYED HERE DURING THE 

2422
01:28:42,883 --> 01:28:47,889
EARTHQUAKE. 

2423
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,223
THERE IS NOW SO MUCH DEBRIS 

2424
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:50,625
HERE AND SO LITTLE TO MOVE IT 

2425
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:51,859
WITH THAT IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE 

2426
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:53,394
HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE FOR THEM 

2427
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,695
TO FIND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 

2428
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:58,366
LIKELY BURIED HERE. 

2429
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,667
SADLY THEY EXPECT TO FIND MANY 

2430
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,334
MORE VICTIMS. 

2431
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:01,302
THE CITY HOLD A MASS BURIAL 

2432
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:02,770
