to each other tightly and sinking into

82
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,460
the unknown not recklessly nor

83
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,140
thoughtlessly forever expecting both

84
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,510
happiness and hardships until the last

85
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,070
bit of meaningful words are spoken from

86
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,020
their lips until they hit the bottom of

87
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,790
the sea together meaningful words spoken

88
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,530
like I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be with you forever and</font>

89
00:03:51,530 --> 00:00:00,000
in the end in the Hereafter
