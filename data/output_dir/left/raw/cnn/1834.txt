1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:09,030
John Sarah won't question that went
unanswered today was some 359 members of

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,730
the doctor program enlisted in the US
Army in 2016

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,270
their tour of duty would run standard
four years I would assume but their

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,400
doctor status would only last two years
if there's no fix by Congress before

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,430
March the fifth do you know what
happened to those people will they

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,510
become ineligible to remain in the
military or whether it be special

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,590
dispensation is that we have confidence
that Congress is gonna step up and do

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,090
their job this is something that needs
to be fixed legislatively and we have

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,840
confidence that they're going to do that
and we stand ready and willing to work

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,239
with them in order to accomplish
responsible immigration reform and that

11
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,370
would include daka's certainly part of
that process Republicans who believe

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,510
that getting something on the Republican
side it's not going to be easy that the

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,320
divisions that we see between the center
and the right and the Republican Party

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,920
will become only deeper what gives you
confidence with all due respect I don't

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,369
think the American people elected
Congress to do things that were easy

16
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,780
they elected them to make a government
that works to work properly and to work

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,229
for American people and that's their job
and if they can't do it then they need

18
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,920
to get out of the way and let somebody
else who can take on a heavy lift and

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,840
get things accomplished major in the
context of daca as a piece of

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,920
legislation would the president be
willing to sign only something that

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,880
addresses that or would it also need to
have components of the raise act would

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,680
there need to be funding for the border
wall or would he be willing to sign

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,450
simply simply addresses daca
legislature the president wants to see

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,860
responsible immigration reform and he
wants that to be part of it but again we

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,670
can't take just a one piece fix we've
got to do an overall immigration reform

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,579
that's responsible and frankly that's
lawful and that's what the president

27
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,759
wants to see Congress do the priorities
for him it

28
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,869
comprehensive reform package daca and
what else and certainly to control the

29
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,669
boat to control the border to improve
vetting and immigration security enforce

30
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,849
our laws and do things that protect
American workers the president's mind is

31
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:21,410
it an option you simply contain a North
Korea that possesses nuclear weapons

32
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,180
certainly the priority of the
administration is to have

33
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,010
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
and it's also to protect American

34
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:44,670
citizens but certainly the priority
would be that Congress hasn't been able

35
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,530
to really do much at all this year what
gives him confidence that they're going

36
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,590
to be able to act the integration hasn't
spoken to any congressional leaders

37
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,019
since making this decision he's spoken
to a number of leaders but hopefully as

38
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,829
you guys all know they just came back
from a three-week vacation I think that

39
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:06,090
they should be rested and ready to take
on some big challenges that America

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,120
faces the lives of 800,000 because it's
Congress's job to legislate it's not the

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,269
president's job to to create law it's
not it's it's Congress's job to create

42
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,030
legislation I think that's something we
all learned in eighth grade civics I

43
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,269
know I certainly did and I think that
every member of Congress should know

44
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,989
that that is their duty and we're asking
them to fulfill it it's pretty simple I

45
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,980
think that the American people elected
them to do it and again if they can't

46
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,160
then they should get out of the way and
let somebody else take their job that

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,239
can actually get something done Steve
what consideration are you giving to

48
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:47,690
negotiations with North Korea over them
look I think in terms of negotiations

49
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,910
we're looking at putting aggressive
measures both diplomatically

50
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,790
economically and as we've said all
options are on the table and we're going

51
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,910
to continue to push for a safer and a
nuclearized

52
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,200
Korean Peninsula and that's that's the
priority here Jim it sounds like the

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,160
president is saying you're saying that
if we're going to allow the dreamers to

54
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,130
stay in this country we want a wall is
that accurate

55
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,850
IIIi don't think that the president's
been shy about the fact that he wants a

56
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,500
wall and certainly something that he
feels is an important part of a

57
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,630
responsible immigration reform package
why did the president not come out and

58
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,750
make this announcement himself today why
didn't he leave it to his attorney

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,540
general it's his decision these kids and
their lives are on the line because of

60
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,960
what he's doing it's in large part a big
part of the legal process this was

61
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,200
deemed illegal by I think just about
every legal expert that you can find in

62
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,160
the country including many of Obama's
own attorneys said that this was not

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,960
lawful program and therefore it would be
the Department of Justice to make a

64
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:10,010
legal recommendation and that's what
they did would the president sign a

65
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,750
standalone extension again I've
addressed this the president is hoping

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,560
to work with Congress on responsible
immigration reform and I laid out the

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,870
priorities that the administration has
on that front

68
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,520
the president voiced and you voiced some
some objections to the constitutionality

69
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,320
of daca where does the president stand
on the program itself i I think that in

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,090
the answers that I've given is that the
president has been and I think part of

71
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,150
the reason that this is complicated and
one of the reasons he's wrestled with

72
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,270
this back and forth in large part is
because this is not an easy one and

73
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,460
certainly something where he wants to be
able to make a decision with compassion

74
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,289
but
at the same time you can't allow a

75
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,740
motion to govern and this has to be
something where the law is put in place

76
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,740
and it's something that he would support
if Congress puts it before him

77
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:08,539
responsible immigration reform we can't
just have one tweak to the immigration

78
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,939
system we need really big fixes and big
reform in this process and we've laid

79
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:26,500
out the principles that we feel are
important sorry John Decker expressed

80
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,199
sympathy for the daca recipients today
we heard a statement from House Speaker

81
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,289
Paul Ryan who said that these so-called
dreamers have done nothing wrong was

82
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,580
this a difficult decision for the
president to take this drastic action

83
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,089
given what he said as recently as
February and does he agree with House

84
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:54,889
Speaker Paul Ryan that these individuals
800,000 individuals have done nothing

85
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:01,069
wrong I think largely yes and and that's
why I said it was one of the things that

86
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:07,430
the president wrestled with this
decision all throughout the weekend so I

87
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:16,699
kind of addressed that well no I mean I
think we've been clear throughout the

88
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,319
process there wasn't a final decision
made until over the weekend because of

89
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,879
the back-and-forth and the complexity of
the issue and the ability to make the

90
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,669
right decision and allow Congress to
actually do their job and provide a fix

91
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,020
instead of just stopping the program and
that was a big point for the president

92
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,839
Jordan you mean when you say the
president wants to act regarding

93
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,710
compassion
we regard to these doctoral Cypriots

94
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,700
does that mean offering them a pathway
to citizenship I think it means

95
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,740
providing a more permanent solution
that's done through the legislative

96
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,140
process done legally and responsibly
unlike the previous administration

97
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,940
solution does that mean like giving them
legal status legislatively like what is

98
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,730
the permanent solution that I think
that's something we want to work with

99
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,320
Congress to determine exactly what that
looks like but there has to be something

100
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,620
needs to be done it's Congress this job
to do that and we want to be part of

101
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,700
that process and make sure that there is
a fix put in place and that this isn't

102
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,590
ignored like it has been for the last
five years get it done by the March of

103
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,590
the deadline considering the president's
personal feelings about these daca

104
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,700
recipients we consider giving them
additional time to get a solution passed

105
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,419
we'd like to have confidence that
Congress will actually do their job

106
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,049
we're gonna ask that they do that and
that they allow us to work with them and

107
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:42,879
be part of that process but again if
Congress doesn't want to do the job that

108
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,670
they were elected to do then maybe they
should get out of the way and let

109
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,630
someone else do it Stephen we referred
to dr. recipient says illegal aliens and

110
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,830
at one point he intimated
hundreds of thousands of Americans did

111
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,690
not get jobs that were taken by doctor
recipients does the president share that

112
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,740
view
I think that it's a known fact that

113
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,360
there are over four million unemployed
Americans in the same age group as those

114
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,910
that are daca recipients that over 950
thousand of those are African American

115
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,420
in the same age group over eight hundred
and seventy thousand unemployed

116
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,990
Hispanics in the same age group those
are large groups of people that are

117
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,520
unemployed that could possibly have
those jobs but again we're looking for

118
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,420
fixes we're not looking for complaints
but we're looking for solutions and

119
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,520
that's our focus moving forward with the
idea that hundreds of thousands of

120
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,950
people if the president gets what he
wants

121
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,800
would achieve legal status had it how do
you reconcile those two competing

122
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,700
interests well I think one of the first
things is the president is looking to

123
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,940
create a whole lot more jobs in America
so that it addresses both problems

124
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,890
there's a reason he's focused largely
since day one of taking office in

125
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,840
creating a better market for the
businesses to create jobs to hire more

126
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,460
people higher wages he's gotten rid of
over 800 regulations that have helped do

127
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,000
just that
1.2 million jobs have been created since

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,600
he came into office and every single day
we're looking for more ways to grow that

129
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,250
number and so we're doing our part to
address and create an environment that

130
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,690
allows people to have more jobs we're
gonna continue doing that kristan

131
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,139
president vowed to treat dreamers
great heart how is this move treating

132
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:28,070
them with great heart I think by
allowing and orderly process to take

133
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,240
place you know there's a lot of people
that I've seen attacking the president

134
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,819
for not showing the level of compassion
that they feel like he should to me the

135
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:41,899
most heartless thing that I've seen all
day today is that Democrats like Nancy

136
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,130
Pelosi are using this decision today for
fundraising while the president's trying

137
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,490
to fix this situation they are
politicizing an issue instead of

138
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,360
actually doing their job if they would
spend less time fundraising and more

139
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,930
time focusing on solutions we wouldn't
even be in this problem in the first

140
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:14,870
place it's not cold-hearted for the
president to uphold the law we're a

141
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,130
nation of law and order and the day that
we start to ignore the fact that we are

142
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,850
that then we throw away everything that
gives these people a reason to want to

143
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,930
come to our country if we stop becoming
the country that we were envisioned to

144
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,430
be then we throw away what makes us
special which makes America unique this

145
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,300
president's not willing to do that the
previous administration was this one

146
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,639
isn't but we want to have real solutions
we want to have laws that that address

147
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,260
these problems but it's Congress's job
to legislate not the president's and we

148
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,240
actually and we actually want to uphold
the Constitution and I think people

149
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,209
across this country should be
celebrating the fact that they have a

150
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,260
president that is standing up and
upholding the Constitution as he was

151
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,889
elected today

152
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,510
but quickly on danke - is the president
committed to honoring the will of

153
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,970
Congress essentially whatever Congress
passes on dr. dizzy reserve the right to

154
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,570
veto the doc affects if he feels that it
doesn't kind of holistically do what

155
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,190
you're talking about a bigger picture

156
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,250
absolutely want responsible immigration
reform and that would be part of that

157
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,600
package and part of that process

158
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:42,440
wondering to that perspective whether he
still believe sanctions can be effective

159
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,520
and if he has any plans you could share
with us to talk with the Chinese

160
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,270
President or the Russian President
himself look that we've been clear about

161
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,920
what our priorities are that now is not
the time for us to spend a lot of time

162
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,050
focused on talking with North Korea but
putting all measures of pressure that we

163
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,680
can and we're going to continue through
that process we've also said that

164
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,150
everybody including Russia including
China need to do more to address the

165
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,900
threat this is a global threat and
everybody needs to take part in putting

166
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,490
pressure on North Korea and as we've
said many times before both secretary

167
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,820
Madison the president that all options
are on the table and we're going to

168
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,650
continue to keep them on the table until
we get the results that we're looking

169
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:32,140
for Sarah the president has said if the
daca recipients should rest easy

170
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,880
said on several occasions that he loves
them is he giving them his personal

171
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
assurance that at the end of six months
they will not be deported

172
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,750
I think he is giving Congress the
ability to do their job I've said that

173
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:53,080
earlier that they should rescue look the
president gave the ability for us to

174
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,820
have a six-month process for Congress to
actually step up and fix this problem

175
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,450
and they certainly have the ability to
and certainly should take that

176
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:07,470
opportunity during the other immigration
moves that the administration has made

177
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,500
you made the argument that the
president's powers over immigration are

178
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,250
very very broad and unquestioned why in
this case does he feel he can't do

179
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,490
anything by himself and he has to turn
it over to God that was a specific

180
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,140
statute within the Constitution that
allows the president to take action to

181
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,490
protect Americans these are two very
different things and certainly not

182
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:39,970
apples to apples John Gizzi
two questions on daca Tuesday Kansas

183
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,210
secretary of state Kris Kobach a close
ally of the president's denounced the

184
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:52,000
decision because of the six-month delay
in it and said there should be no

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,839
phase-out it should have been
implemented in media

186
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,720
what's your response to that criticism
from a strong supporter and Ally okay I

187
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,439
think our response is pretty clear the
president made a decision and we feel

188
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:10,209
very much that it was the right one
something is that you talked about four

189
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:16,899
million jobs that could go to other
people has the president ever discussed

190
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:22,360
this part of daca with some of the
leaders of organized labor to try to

191
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,699
involve them in the process President
Trump of the afl-cio president of the

192
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:32,379
Teamsters and others that they've worked
with I'm not sure about specific

193
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:37,060
conversations on that exact figure but I
do know that he has had conversations

194
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,620
with individuals and relevant
stakeholders in this process on both

195
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,949
sides that know that that is an issue
whether Daka existed or not the fact

196
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,879
that there are four million people in
this age group that are unemployed and

197
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,170
certainly why creating a better job
market is a priority for the

198
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:02,740
administration Fran Chester asked they
don't know that we heard back here the

199
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,370
rest of your answer you said that the
reason that Attorney General Jeff

200
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:11,410
Sessions put out the earlier statement
on camera was because it was a legal

201
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,740
argument but a lot of what we've been
talking about in here is a legislative

202
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,870
argument why don't we not heard from the
president directly on this day and can

203
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,809
we expect to hear from him later today
on this you have heard directly from the

204
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:27,189
president he issued a pretty lengthy
statement directly from the president I

205
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:31,689
was it Attorney General Jeff Sessions
that that went on camera when the

206
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:35,110
president hasn't
cameras to make this case today about

207
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,800
what a big party has and how
compassionate he is and how he wants

208
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,279
Congress to take legislative action on
this to essentially save dog the

209
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,809
president spoken about this numerous
times in the past but at the same time

210
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:51,399
this was a legal issue because there was
a court decision that had to be made

211
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:57,399
with a timeline not placed that the
administration created but a timeline

212
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,269
that was created by the Attorney
General's in those states that were

213
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,929
forcing this issue in this decision to
take place by today it was a legal

214
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,409
decision and that would fall to the
Attorney General and that's why he would

215
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:18,069
be the one making the announcement Peter
I believe he has had several

216
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,148
conversations with enrollees and those
that have been part of the program tell

217
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:27,489
something about that and what context
and what conversations look again I

218
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,630
think that the president's goal was to
talk to a lot of people on both sides of

219
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,520
the issue and one do what it takes to
uphold the law of hold the Constitution

220
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,080
but also allow Congress to create a
permanent solution and fix the problem

221
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,120
which he's done by allowing for that
six-month period recently as part of

222
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,299
this recent deliberation I again I'm not
sure on the exact timeline but I know he

223
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,990
has had many conversations with people
on both sides of this issue certainly

224
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:03,700
people that support keeping it as is and
those that support right again I like I

225
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,059
said he's I know had conversations with
people that have been part of the

226
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,810
program Catherine
wrestle with this additional weekend he

227
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,690
won't go through any of the process he
went through to get to this when he make

228
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,230
decisions

229
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,640
yeah he made the final decision over the
weekend and as I said he spoke to many

230
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,919
relevant stakeholders and individuals
that support a variety of positions on

231
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:37,929
this program we'll continue to keep you
guys posted I think the ultimate goal is

232
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:42,279
as Congress is coming back into session
to talk about some of the big priorities

233
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,720
certainly tax reform immigration reform
among many other things that are going

234
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:57,100
to be on the agenda for the Fall the
president's basically told Congress to

235
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,600
do things but he hasn't written any
legislation similar to how he approached

236
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,750
I didn't know it was the president's job
to write out specific details of

237
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,220
legislation and I think that other for
exactly what your initiatives have taken

238
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,730
a greater role in helping to craft that
legislation they found friendly allies

239
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,019
in Congress to actually be the ones to
propose it but this president is not is

240
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:21,190
why it has he made that shift and does
he think it's is he reconsidering it in

241
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,000
light of the fact that some of the other
major pushes he's tried to make him not

242
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,570
been successful as we've laid out
detailed principles and we have worked

243
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,320
with members of Congress on specific
pieces of legislation and will continue

244
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,850
to do that
quick international question the

245
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,899
situation in Myanmar is quickly
escalating into a major humanitarian

246
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:45,850
crisis is the president been briefed
on the situation in Myanmar if so is he

247
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,840
planning to speak to any of their
leaders in the upcoming video about this

248
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,210
I know this is something that we're
monitoring closely but I am not aware of

249
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,840
any specific conversations that are
planned at this time but as always in

250
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,710
calls like that we will keep you guys
posted and put a readout after caecilian

251
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,750
enforcement but that's not a guarantee
of protection is this White House

252
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,640
willing to offer one those are certainly
again they're not a targeted priority

253
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,500
but the goal here is that Congress
actually fixes the problem and then that

254
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,550
isn't an issue and so that's the focus
over the next six months it's making

255
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,510
sure that something takes place that
Congress does their job and a real

256
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:34,660
solution is implemented way to put this
in writing so that these 800,000 people

257
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,610
who are very fearful of ending up in a
country that they don't know have some

258
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,780
guarantee that in fact they won't be
deported in six months I think that the

259
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,610
statement that the president put out
earlier today is lays out what the

260
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,390
priorities are and lays out what the
focus of the administration is and that

261
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,990
if they are not targets they are not
certainly not priority targets of this

262
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,910
administration they weren't before and
they won't be now and again Congress has

263
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,240
six months which is a pretty long time
to get something done

264
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,870
and we hope they do and there's a
solution in that so that this isn't a

265
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,010
problem moving forward

266
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,370
wondering you mentioned that the
president spoken over the weekend or

267
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,960
increasing days to vary stakeholders we
need to talk to the attorney general's

268
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,940
office in Texas and they said they did
not get a heads-up or any you know

269
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,960
nobody conferring with them about this
did you all talk to the ten states and

270
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,490
are you positive that they are not so I
know that various members of the

271
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,990
administration have been in contact with
individuals in those states I'm going to

272
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:43,170
wrap here but I have one note - I have
one thing I'd like to just add the

273
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,570
president will be announcing the
donations that he will be personally

274
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:53,130
making to the various charities and
thank you to those of you that have

275
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,460
submitted we had several people put in
submissions and he'll be doing that

276
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,630
tomorrow and again I know there were a
lot of questions over the weekend that

277
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,980
will be a personal donation of a million
dollars from the president to various

278
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,730
organizations and charities many of
which came from this room so thank you

279
00:22:08,730 --> 00:00:00,000
again for that hope you have a good
