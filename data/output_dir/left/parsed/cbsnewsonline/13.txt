START. 
WE START. 
IT'S A GREAT CROWD. 
OH, MONTANA TO ME IS A VERY BIG 
AND POWERFUL STATE I CAN TELL 
YOU THAT. 
AT LEAST IT WILL BE AFTER MATT 
ROSENDALE BECOMES YOUR SENATOR. 
HE'S GREAT. 
BUT I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE IN 
MONTANA WITH THOUSANDS OF 
LOYAL, HARD WORKING, INCREDIBLE 
AMERICAN PATRIOTS. 
HARD TO BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS 
BECAUSE IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE 
TIME. 
LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO, BUT 
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO, RIGHT? 
THAT WAS SOME DAY. 
THAT WAS SOME EVENING. 
THAT WAS SOME PERIOD. 
THAT WAS A MOVEMENT LIKE WE'VE 
NEVER EVER SEEN BEFORE. 
AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN. 
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE, DOESN'T 
SEEM LONG, BUT IT FLIES. 
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A 
GOOD TIME, AND YOU'RE DOING A 
GOOD JOB, TIME FLIES, RIGHT? 
TIME FLIES. 
AND IN JUST 19 DAYS, THE PEOPLE 
OF THIS INCREDIBLE STATE ARE 
GOING TO SEND MATT ROSENDALE TO 
THE U.S. SENATE TO PROTECT YOUR 
JOBS, AND PROTECT YOUR SECOND 
AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER 
SIEGE. 
THIS I WOULD THINK IS A VERY 
BIG SECOND AMENDMENT PLACE. 
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONE 
THAT WALKS INTO YOUR HOUSES. 
GIVE ME THAT GUN. 
NOBODY HAS THE COURAGE TO DO 
THAT. 
MATT IS GOING TO PROTECT YOUR 
SECOND AMENDMENT, AND HE'S 
GOING TO DEFEND YOUR BORDERS, 
AND WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB ON 
THOSE BORDERS WITH THE WORST 
LAWS YOU'VE EVER SEEN, AND WE 
ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
TOGETHER. 
REALLY ARE. 
THIS IS TRULY AN INCREDIBLE 
TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL 
TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER 50 
YEARS. 
THINK OF THAT. 
MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW WORKING 
THAN EVER BEFORE. 
HERE IN MONTANA, HOUSEHOLD 
INCOMES HAVE REACHED AN ALL-
TIME HIGH. 
THINK OF THAT. 
THINK OF THAT. 
AND WE WATCH MONTANA. 
WE WATCH YOU MINERS, YOU 
LOGGERS, YOU RANCHERS, WE WATCH 
MONTANA. 
AND YOU KNOW TWO YEARS AGO YOU 
WATCHED OVER ME, BECAUSE WE WON 
THIS STATE BY A LOT. 
RIGHT? 
THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE QUICKIES, 
I LOVE THOSE STATES. 
YOU KNOW THE POLLS CLOSED. 
THE POLES HAVE JUST CLOSED IN 
THE STATE OF MONTANA. 
TRUMP HAS WON MONTANA. 
IT'S LIKE -- THEY SAY IT, 
BECAUSE WHEN IT'S THAT BIG, 
THEY ANNOUNCE IT WITHIN 
SECONDS. 
IT'S JUST A FLOW. 
THEY DO COMMA, TRUMP HAS WON 
MONTANA. 
YOU'VE BEEN GREAT TO ME. 
WE'RE ALSO TAKING CARE OF YOUR 
VETERANS. 
YOU HAVE A LOT OF VETERANS IN 
MONTANA. 
AND OUR MILITARY, YOU KNOW 
WE'VE REBUILT, AND ARE 
REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, WILL 
SOON BE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER 
BEFORE. 
AND HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO 
USE IT. 
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT 
HAVING IT. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SAY, OKAY, 
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THAT. 
THAT'S THE WAY LIFE WORKS ISN'T 
IT? 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MOST 
POWERFUL MILITARY BY FAR THAT 
WE'VE EVER HAD, AND A LOT OF IT 
IS ALREADY COMING. 
THOSE BRAND NEW BEAUTIFUL 
PLANES. 
THOSE INCREDIBLE STEALTH F35s. 
YEAH, THE F35, YOU HAVE THE F-
18s, THE SUPER DUPERS. 
THE HORNETS. 
WE HAVE THEM ALL. 
WE'VE GOT THEM COMING LEFT AND 
RIGHT. 
AND YOU KNOW THE GREAT THING? 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT 
THAN THE MILITARY, BUT WE BUILD 
THEM ALL RIGHT HERE IN THE 
U.S.A. 
WE DON'T SEND THEM TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO BE BUILT. 
WE BUILD THEM RIGHT HERE. 
WE HAVE THE BEST MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. 
WE BUILD THE BEST. 
THERE'S NOTHING EVEN CLOSE. 
BEST MISSILES, BEST PLANES, 
BEST SHIPS, BEST EVERYTHING. 
WE BUILD THEM HERE. 
SUBMARINES, WE'RE SO FAR AHEAD 
OF EVERYTHING. 
FORGET IT. 
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, 
AMERICA IS BOOMING. 
AMERICA IS THRIVING, AND 
AMERICA IS WINNING, BECAUSE WE 
ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA 
FIRST AGAIN. 
IT'S AMERICA FIRST. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
WE'RE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
FOR MANY, MANY DECADES YOU 
HAVEN'T HEARD. 
JUST LAST WEEK WE SHAVED 
ANOTHER HISTORIC VICTORY FOR 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A 
BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
WE PROUDLY SWORE IN THE NEWEST 
MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
 
AND THOSE DEMOCRATS TREATED HIM 
BADLY. 
VERY UNFAIR. 
THAT WAS AN UNFAIR DEAL. 
FROM THE SECOND THE SUPREME 
COURT VACANCY OPENED, DEMOCRATS 
RUN A HEARTLESS CAMPAIGN OF 
POLITICAL AND PERSONAL 
DESTRUCTION. 
IT WAS DISGRACEFUL. 
BEFORE HE WAS EVEN CHOSEN. 
BEFORE I EVEN KNEW WHO I WAS 
GOING TO PICK, THEY WERE SAYING 
HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT MY 
CANDIDATE. 
I SAID I HAVEN'T PICKED ANYONE 
YET. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
THAT WAS TERRIBLE WHAT THEY DID 
WAS TERRIBLE. 
WHAT THEY DID TO BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND HIS BEAUTIFUL 
FAMILY IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE 
THAT WILL NOT BE SOON 
FORGOTTEN. 
REMEMBER THAT. 
AND COME ELECTION DAY AMERICANS 
WILL REMEMBER KAVANAUGH, AND 
THEY WILL REMEMBER ALL SORTS OF 
OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THAT WAS A 
SHAMEFUL ACT, AND THERE ARE 
MANY OTHER SHAMEFUL ACTS, 
INCLUDING WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO 
OUR BORDER BY SAYING WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO GIVE YOU THE LAWS THAT 
YOU NEED TO PROTECT OUR 
COUNTRY, BUT WE'RE TAKING IT, 
AND WE'RE DOING IT, AND WE HAVE 
GREAT THINGS HAPPENING. 
THIS WILL BE AN ELECTION OF 
KAVANAUGH. 
THE CARAVAN. 
LAW AND ORDER, AND COMMON 
SENSE. 
THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE. 
IT'S GOING TO BE AN ELECTION OF 
THOSE THINGS. 
LAW AND ORDER. 
KAVANAUGH. 
REMEMBER COMMON SENSE, AND 
REMEMBER IT'S GOING TO BE AN 
ELECTION OF THE CARAVAN. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT. 
AND NOW WE'RE STARTING TO FIND 
OUT, AND I WON'T SAY IT 100%, 
I'LL PUT A LITTLE TINY QUESTION 
MARK AT THE END, BUT WE'RE 
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO NEED IT, 
BUT WE HAVE THE FAKE NEWS BACK 
THERE.  
FAKE NEWS. 
BUT A LOT OF MONEY HAS BEEN 
PASSING THROUGH PEOPLE TO COME 
UP AND TRY AND GET TO THE 
BORDER BY ELECTION DAY. 
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S A 
NEGATIVE FOR US. 
NUMBER 1, THEY'RE BEING 
STOPPED. 
AND NUMBER 2, REGARDLESS, 
THAT'S OUR ISSUE. 
SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH 
THEM. 
THEY HAVE ONE THING THEY STICK 
TOGETHER. 
THEY VOTE TOGETHER. 
THEY'RE BAD POLITICIANS, THEY 
HAVE HORRIBLE POLICY. 
THEY HATE I.C.E. 
THEY DON'T LIKE OUR MILITARY. 
THEY DON'T LIKE OUR VETS. 
THEY'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING US ON 
THAT. 
THEY HAVE LOUSY POLICY. 
THE ONE THING, THEY STICK 
TOGETHER, BUT THEY WANTED THAT 
CARAVAN, AND THERE ARE THOSE 
THAT SAY THAT CARAVAN DIDN'T 
JUST HAPPEN. 
IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN. 
A LOT OF REASONS THAT CARAVAN, 
4,000 PEOPLE, BUT I JUST WANT 
TO THANK THE MEXICAN 
GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE THEY'RE 
STOPPING IT HOPEFULLY BEFORE IT 
EVER GETS TO MEXICO. 
AS YOU KNOW, I AM WILLING TO 
SEND THE MILITARY TO DEFEND OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER IF NECESSARY. 
ALL BECAUSE OF THE ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION ONSLAUGHT BROUGHT 
BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY 
REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE, OR TO 
CHANGE THE LAWS. 
THEY LIKE IT. 
THEY ALSO FIGURE EVERYBODY 
COMING IN'S GOING TO VOTE 
DEMOCRAT. 
YOU KNOW. 
HEY, THEY'RE NOT SO STUPID WHEN 
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT? 
BUT THEY ARE CRAZY. 
THE CRAZY DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO 
SUPPORT ANY FORM OF BORDER 
SECURITY LEGISLATION TO FIX OUR 
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, OLD 
FASHIONED LOOPHOLE RIDDEN 
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
WE HAVE THE WORST LAWS ANYWHERE 
IN THE WORLD. 
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST LAWS 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
SOMEBODY COMES IN, AND WE SAY, 
EXCUSE ME. 
A FOOT HITS THE GROUND. 
A FOOT HITS THE GROUND, WE'RE 
NOT ALLOWED TO SAY GO BACK. 
A FOOT HITS THE GROUND, WE HAVE 
TO BY LAW, WITH THESE HORRIBLE 
PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING THEIR 
OWN RULINGS, HAVING NOTHING TO 
DO WITH OUR CONSTITUTION, WE 
HAVE TO TAKE THOSE PEOPLE IN, 
EVEN IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS. 
AND WE HAVE HARDENED CRIMINALS 
COMING IN. 
YOU THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE 
PERFECT? 
THEY'RE NOT PERFECT. 
YOU HAVE SOME HARDENED, BAD 
PEOPLE COMING IN. 
AND BY LAW, WE HAVE TO TAKE 
THEM IN, AND THEN IT'S CALLED 
CATCH AND RELEASE. 
YOU EVER HEAR OF THIS ONE? 
YOU CATCH THEM. 
YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THEM. 
EVEN IF YOU FIND OUT BAD 
THINGS, YOU CATCH THEM AND YOU 
RELEASE THEM. 
AND THEN YOU SAY, COME BACK FOR 
A COURT CASE. 
THERE'S ONLY A PROBLEM, THERE'S 
NOT ENOUGH JUDGES IN THE WORLD 
TO TAKE CARE OF IT. 
AND I WILL SAY, I HAVE CAUSED 
THE PROBLEM. 
I'M TAKING FULL BLAME. 
YOU KNOW WHY? 
EVERYONE'S LIKE IN SHOCK. 
IT'S MY, HEY LOOK, FAKE NEWS, 
IT'S MY PROBLEM, I CAUSED IT. 
BECAUSE I HAVE CREATED SUCH AN 
INCREDIBLE ECONOMY. 
I HAVE CREATED SO MANY JOBS. 
I'VE MADE THIS COUNTRY WITH YOU 
SO GREAT THAT EVERYBODY WANTS 
TO COME IN. 
SO THEY'RE ALL POURING IN, OR 
TRYING TO. 
SO, WITH THE WORST LAWS IN THE 
WORLD WE'RE DOING A OF A JOB. 
BUT WE'VE MADE OUR COUNTRY 
STRONG. 
WE'VE MADE OUR COUNTRY 
RESPECTED, AND PEOPLE WANT TO 
COME IN. 
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT WE HAVE 
TO DO, WE NEED VOTES. 
MEANING WE NEED REPUBLICANS TO 
VOTE. 
YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP HEARING, WE 
HAVE A MAJORITY. 
WE HAVE A MAJORITY THAT IF 
SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, IF 
SOMEBODY'S NOT FEELING WELL, WE 
LOSE OUR MAJORITY. 
THAT'S HOW IT IS. 
WE HAVE LIKE ALMOST LIKE 
IDENTICAL. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE VOTES, SO 
WE CAN PUT IN STRONG 
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, BUT 
COMMON SENSE. 
IT'S NOT EVEN REPUBLICAN 
CONSERVATIVE, IT'S COMMON SENSE 
POLICIES. 
IT'S COMMON SENSE. 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A LOT OF 
DEMOCRATS THAT SUPPORT US, 
FRANKLY. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATS 
THAT AREN'T CRAZY. 
INTELLIGENT. 
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS 
GONE SO FAR LEFT THAT NOBODY 
KNOWS WHAT TO DO. 
IT'S BECOME RADICAL RESISTENCE. 
YOU EVER SEE THEIR SIGNS? 
RESIST. 
THEY SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO 
RESIST? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
DID YOU EVER SEE WHEN THE FAKE 
NEWS INTERVIEW THEM? 
THEY'LL GO TO A PERSON HOLDING 
A SIGN WHO GETS PAID BY SAROS 
OR SOMEBODY. 
DID YOU SEE THAT WITH JUSTICE 
KAVANAUGH, AND BY THE WAY, ALSO 
WITH JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH. 
HOW GOOD IS HE? 
IT'S A GREAT TWO PEOPLE. 
BUT DID YOU SEE THE SIGNS? 
THEY'RE BRAND NEW. 
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, THE BLACK 
AND WHITE SIGNS. 
EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME SIGNS, 
RIGHT FROM THE FINEST PRINTER 
IN WASHINGTON. 
THOSE ARE NOT SIGNS MADE IN THE 
BASEMENT. 
THEY'RE ALL IDENTICAL. 
I POINTED THAT OUT, AND THE 
NEXT DAY EVERY HAD SIGNS THAT 
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE MADE IN 
THE BASEMENT. 
I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THE BLACK 
AND WHITE ONES. 
HEY, THERE'S A LOT OF RIGGED 
THINGS GOING ON IN THIS 
COUNTRY, YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT. 
A LOT OF RIGGED THINGS GOING 
ON. 
JUST ASK BERNIE SANDERS. 
DO YOU THINK THINGS ARE RIGGED 
BERNIE? 
YOU CAN ASK ME TOO. 
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT RIGGING. 
I TELL YOU WHAT. 
BUT WE FIGHT LIKE NOBODY EVER 
FOUGHT BEFORE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO. 
WE FIGHT, AND WE WIN, AND WE 
FIGHT HARDER THAN ANYBODY EVER 
FOUGHT. 
AND THEN THEY SAY, OH, IT'S 
OBSTRUCTION. 
IT'S OBSTRUCTION. 
IF YOU FIGHT BACK TODAY IT'S 
CALLED OBSTRUCTION. 
NO, NO, NO. 
WE FIGHT BACK. 
CALL IT WHATEVER THE YOU WANT. 
WE FIGHT BACK. 
OBSTRUCTION. 
YOU KNOW, I JUST WALKED IN ON A 
BIG STRONG GUY GRABBED ME. 
AND HE WAS ALMOST CRYING. 
AND IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME. 
AND MANY TIMES. 
AND HE SAID, SIR, MR. 
PRESIDENT, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR SAVING OUR COUNTRY. 
AND YOU KNOW, NOW I'VE, I HEAR 
IT ALL THE TIME. 
THOSE EXACT WORDS, THANK YOU 
FOR SAVING OUR COUNTRY, AND AT 
FIRST I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT 
MONTHS AGO. 
YOU SEE WHAT WE DID WITH TAXES. 
FORGET TAXES, WITH SO MANY 
THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TAX 
CUTS. 
ALTHOUGH THOSE TAX CUTS THEY 
CAME IN HANDY, DIDN'T THEY? 
EVERYBODY BENEFITED FROM THAT. 
BUT REGULATION. 
YOU ADD IT ALL UP, AND THEY SAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. 
PRESIDENT FOR SAVING OUR 
COUNTRY. 
THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE ALL 
TOGETHER, BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN 
A MOVEMENT LIKE WE'VE NEVER 
SEEN BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY, 
LIKE PROBABLY ALMOST EVERY 
COUNTRY, THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A 
MOVEMENT LIKE WHAT HAPPENED 
WITH US IN 2016. 
AND WE ALL TOGETHER, NOT ME, 
I'M A SPOKESPERSON. 
BY THE WAY, HOW HAVE I DONE? 
HAVE I DONE OKAY? 
 
I WAS SPEAKING TO A BIG 
POLITICIAN THE OTHER DAY, IT 
WAS SORT OF FUNNY, HE WAS 
TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. 
YOU WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING IN 
A CERTAIN WAY. 
SAID SIR, I'VE WON FIVE 
ELECTIONS. 
I'VE RUN EIGHT TIMES. 
SO I'VE WON, SIR, FIVE. 
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. 
I'M A PROFESSIONAL. 
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG 
TIME. 
SO THINK OF IT. 
HE RUNS EIGHT TIMES. 
SIR, I WON FIVE ELECTIONS. 
I SAID WELL YOU GOT ME THAT. 
I RAN ONCE, AND I WON ONE 
ELECTION, BUT IT'S THE 
PRESIDENCY, RIGHT? 
THAT'S RIGHT.  
THE PRESIDENCY. 
IT'S THE PRESIDENCY. 
THINK OF IT. 
WE'RE ONE FOR ONE. 
WE'RE GOING TO SOON BE TWO FOR 
TWO, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE IT. 
ALTHOUGH A LOT OF FAKE NEWS 
SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP AT 
EIGHT YEARS. 
HE'S GOING LONGER. 
WE'LL NEVER TAKE IT AWAY FROM 
HIM. 
THIS IS LIKE THE GROUP OF THEM. 
FIRST THEY SAY, HE DOESN'T KNOW 
WHAT HE'S DOING. 
PERHAPS HE'S INCOMPETENT, HE 
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. 
THEN TWO MINUTES LATER SAY, 
HE'S GUNNING FOR EIGHT YEARS, 
HE'S GOING TO TAKE IT FOR 
LONGER. 
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH. 
YOU CAN ONLY GO ONE WAY OR THE 
OTHER. 
NO, EIGHT YEARS IS GOING TO BE 
FINE. 
EIGHT YEARS, GOING TO BE FINE. 
IT'S ALL THE TIME WE NEED. 
THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE NEED TO 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
IS THAT MAYBE THE GREATEST 
SLOGAN IN THE HISTORY OF RUNS? 
RIGHT? 
YOU REMEMBER HILLARY'S SLOGAN? 
IT WAS THE WORST SLOGAN. 
THEY PAID LIKE A MILLION 
DOLLARS FOR SOME GUY TO MAKE 
THE SLOGAN, AND AFTER I 
DISSECTED IT AT ONE SPEECH, 
THEY CHANGED IT THE NEXT DAY. 
COME TOGETHER OR SOMETHING 
TERRIBLE. 
COME TOGETHER. 
SHE'S A GREAT UNIFIER, RIGHT. 
A GREAT UNIFIER. 
CROOKED HILLARY IS A GREAT 
UNIFIER. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE THE DEEP 
STATE, WHERE THEY DON'T EVEN 
LOOK AT HER. 
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE? 
THINK OF IT. 
33,000 EMAILS. 
SHE GETS A SUBPOENA FROM THE 
UNITED STATES CONGRESS. 
FORGET ABOUT ALL THE OTHER 
THINGS. 
FORGET ABOUT, AND YOU CAN NEVER 
FORGET ABOUT BENGHAZI, EVER. 
BUT FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING 
ELSE. 
NEVER FORGET BENGHAZI. 
BUT FORGET ABOUT ALL THE OTHER 
THINGS. 
33,000 EMAILS. 
SHE GETS A SUBPOENA . NOT LIKE 
A SUBPOENA FROM YOU, OR YOU, OR 
THAT YOUNG PERSON BACK THERE. 
A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED 
STATES CONGRESS. 
SHE GETS IT. 
THEN SHE DELETES 33,000 EMAILS, 
AND SHE ACID WASHES, SHE ACID 
WASHES. 
THIS WAY, IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE 
PROCESS, NEVER USED. 
NEVER USED BECAUSE IT COSTS SO 
MUCH. 
IT'S CALLED ACID WATCHING. 
IT'S CALLED BLEACH BID. 
FIVE DIFFERENT NAMES. 
BUT I LIKE ACID WASHING, 
BECAUSE THAT REALLY SAYS IT. 
SHE ACID WASHES 33,000, SO 
NOBODY CAN EVER FIND THEM. 
BUT THEY'RE AROUND SOME PLACE. 
I THINK THAT MAYBE, MAYBE 
THEY'RE AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT. 
WE HAVE A GREAT MAN NOW AT THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT. 
MIKE POMPEO. 
BUT MAYBE THEY'RE AT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. 
THEY COULD VERY WELL BE AT THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU CAN 
BELIEVE THAT WHOLE DEAL. 
BUT WE'RE JUST BEING QUIET. 
WE'RE BEING QUIET, YOU KNOW 
WHY? 
THERE'S BEEN NO COLLUSION. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 
LET'S SAY WE'RE LOSING THE 
STATE OF MONTANA. 
THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. 
AND I GET AN URGENT CALL FROM 
MY PEOPLE IN MONTANA, AND I'M 
IN NEW YORK, OR I'M IN 
WASHINGTON, AND THEY SAY, SIR, 
SIR, WE'RE LOSING THE STATE OF 
MONTANA. 
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO? 
CAN YOU IMAGINE ME SAYING OH, I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. 
GEE, LET'S CALL THE RUSSIANS, 
MAYBE THEY CAN HELP. 
NO, CAN YOU BELIEVE THE 
STUPIDITY OF THIS? 
LET'S CALL THE RUSSIANS. 
IF I EVER CALLED THE RUSSIANS 
THE FIRST ONE TO KNOW ABOUT IT 
WOULD BE THE STATE OF MONTANA, 
AND THEY WOULDN'T BE TOO HAPPY. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE LET'S CALL THE 
RUSSIANS? 
IT'S A DISGRACE. 
IT WAS AN EXCUSE MADE BY THE 
DEMOCRATS FOR LOSING AN 
ELECTION THAT FRANKLY THEY 
SHOULD WIN, BECAUSE THE 
ELECTORAL COLLEGE, REMEMBER, 
THERE'S NO WAY TO 270. 
I WENT TO, THAT'S EXACTLY 
RIGHT, 306. 
I WENT, THAT'S RIGHT. 
HOW MANY TIMES YOU HEARD THERE 
IS NO WAY. 
SO I WENT TO MAINE. 
I LOVE MAINE, BY THE WAY. 
ONE VOTE. 
GOT ONE. 
ONE. 
SO I WENT TO MAINE FOUR OR FIVE 
TIMES. 
I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF MAINE. 
AND I ENDED UP WINNING THAT 
ONE. 
BUT I DIDN'T NEED IT, BECAUSE 
WE WON MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN 
AND PENNSYLVANIA AND A LOT OF 
STUFF. 
AND A LOT OF STATES. 
NO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IT WAS 
AN EXCITING, IT WAS AN EXCITING 
TIME. 
AND NEXT TIME DEMOCRATS ARE 
GOING TO LEARN WHERE THEY HAVE 
TO RUN. 
YOU GOT TO RUN IN THE RIGHT 
PLACES. 
THESE WERE NOT GREAT 
COMPETITORS. 
BUT THEY WERE FUN. 
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE MORE 
EFFECTIVE IN MY OPINION AFTER 
THE ELECTION THAN BEFORE THE 
ELECTION. 
DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE? 
YOU KNOW? 
SENSE. 
WISE GUYS. 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TURNED, I 
LOVE YOU TOO, WHO SAID THAT? 
WHO SAID THAT? 
WHO SAID THAT? 
IT'S FINALLY A WOMAN. 
YOU KNOW I GET IT FROM THE MEN 
ALL THE TIME. 
AND SO FAR EVERY GUY THAT SAID 
I LOVE YOU, THEY'RE JUST NOT MY 
TYPE. 
I FINALLY HEARD IT FROM A 
WOMAN. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
AND LOOK AT ALL THE WOMEN FOR 
TRUMP SIGNS. 
HERE WE GO AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME 
THING. 
EVERYONE SAYS BUT WILL HE GET 
THE WOMEN? 
THEY EVER TELL YOU THESE FAKERS 
ON TELEVISION, THE PUNDITS, 
REAL GENIUSES, THEY'VE REALLY 
DONE WELL IN PREDICTING ME. 
HE'S NEVER GOING TO RUN. 
HE HAS TOO GOOD OF A LIFE. 
HE'S JUST DOING IT FOR FUN. 
NEVER RUN. 
BUT HE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME. 
I SAID THAT'S A GOOD TIME? 
SO I RUN. 
THEN SEPTEMBER, ONE BY ONE WE 
KNOCK THEM OFF, KNOCK THEM OFF, 
KNOCK THEM OFF. 
REMEMBER? 
18 PEOPLE. 
17 OPPONENTS. 
VERY TALENTED OPPONENTS IN MANY 
CASES. 
NOT IN ALL CASES, BUT IN MANY 
CASES. 
I REMEMBER CHARLES KRAUTHIMMER 
AND HE WAS TALKING. 
WELL HE TREATED YOU BETTER THAN 
HE TREATED ME, THAT'S OKAY. 
BUT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 
FIELD. 
I HADN'T ENTERED. 
AND HE SAID WHY WOULD HE DO 
THIS? 
THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST 
FIELD OF REPUBLICANS EVER 
ASSEMBLED FOR ANELECTION, AND I 
LOOKED AT MY LIFE. 
BY THE WAY, HOW GREAT IS OUR 
FIRST LADY? 
IS SHE DOING GREAT? 
PEOPLE LOVE OUR FIRST LADY. 
LOOK AT ALL THE SIGNS, WE LOVE 
OUR FIRST LADY. 
WE LOVE OUR FIRST LADY. 
JUST CAME BACK FROM AFRICA. 
JUST CAME BACK FROM AFRICA AND 
SHE GOT GREAT PEOPLE. 
THEY LOVE HER. 
SHE WENT INTO AREAS THAT IT WAS 
SAD BECAUSE SUCH POVERTY. 
SHE WENT IN WITH HER ARMS WIDE 
OPEN, AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES" 
AND SOME OTHERS, ALL THEY COULD 
TALK ABOUT, SHE WORE A CERTAIN 
HAT. 
AND THEY SAID, IT REPRESENTED A 
COLONIALIZATION, AND EVERYBODY 
WAS TRYING TO FIGURE, AND I 
THINK IT CAME OUT OF LOS 
ANGELES. 
I THINK THEY ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT 
IN LOS ANGELES. 
BUT THEY LOVE THE JOB SHE'S 
DOING. 
AND YESTERDAY THEY HAD A 
PROBLEM, RIGHT? 
YOU SAW THAT FIRE ON THE PLANE. 
AND I GOT A CALL, SIR, YOUR 
WIFE IS UP IN THE AIR. 
THERE'S A FIRE ON THE PLANE. 
I SAID DON'T TELL ME THAT. 
DON'T TELL ME. 
AND THEY CAME DOWN QUICKLY. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
GREAT PILOTS. 
GREAT PILOTS. 
THEN SHE WAS COOL. 
SHE WAS COOL. 
I DID HAVE TO, ONCE I FOUND 
OUT, I ASKED HOW WAS SHE? 
WAS SHE SCARED? 
NO SIR. 
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE? 
SHE WAS SO COOL WE COULDN'T 
BELIEVE IT. 
EVERYBODY ELSE HAD CLOTH ON 
THEIR FACE, AND I PROBABLY 
WOULD HAVE ALSO. 
CLOTH THAT WAS WATER, RIGHT? 
WET ON THEIR FACE. 
SHE SAT THERE, WHAT ELSE IS 
NEW? 
SHE'S A GREAT FIRST LADY. 
SHE'S DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
AND YOU THINK IT'S EASY FOR HER 
TO BE A FIRST LADY. 
NOT SO EASY. 
SHE'S DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
BUT CHARLES SAID THERE'S NEVER 
BEEN A FIELD LIKE THIS, AND I 
ACTUALLY WENT TO MY WIFE AND 
SAID YOU KNOW, A VERY SMART MAN 
JUST SAID THERE'S NEVER BEEN A 
FIELD AS TALENTED AS THIS. 
NOW A LOT OF THEM ARE FRIENDS 
OF MINE. 
ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE FRIENDS 
OF MINE. 
YOU GO THROUGH WARS TOGETHER, 
AND IF YOU'RE SMART, AND 
THEY'RE SMART, YOU GET ALONG. 
I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS. 
TED CRUZ HAS BECOME A FRIEND OF 
MINE. 
HE'S DOING GREAT IN TEXAS. 
MARCO RUBIO. 
CHRIS CHRISTIE. 
MIKE HUCKABEE, HE WAS IN THERE 
AT THE BEGINNING. 
REMEMBER, HE GOT UP? 
AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
YOU GUYS ARE WASTING YOUR TIME 
FOR. 
NOBODY'S GOING TO BEAT TRUMP. 
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? 
YOU CAN'T BEAT HIM. 
IN FACT, YOU REMEMBER, IN FACT, 
I JUST WENT OUT, AND I'M 
DROPPING OUT AFTER THIS DEBATE, 
BUT NONE OF YOU GUYS ARE GOING 
TO BEAT TRUMP. 
THAT WAS MIKE HUCKABEE. 
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. 
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. 
IT WAS VERY GOOD FOR ME EGO. 
IN FACT, THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
MY BEST DEBATE. 
NO MIKE IS GREAT. 
WE HAVE SUCH GREAT PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE SUCH GREAT PEOPLE AND A 
LOT OF TALENTED PEOPLE, AND THE 
END RESULT IS THIS IS WHERE WE 
ARE. 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TRULY TURNED 
INTO AN ANGRY MOB. 
BENT ON DESTROYING ANYTHING OR 
ANYONE IN THEIR PATH, AND YOUR  
SENATOR IS ONE OF THEM. 
LET ME TELL YOU, YOUR SUPPORT 
IS DISGRACEFUL WHAT HE DID. 
THIS ELECTION YOU WILL DECIDE 
WHICH PARTY IS IN CONTROL OF 
CONGRESS. 
THAT'S TRUE. 
AND IF THEY WIN, EVEN IF THEY 
WIN THE HOUSE, IT'S GOING TO BE 
JUST FIGHTING, FIGHTING, 
FIGHTING. 
IT'S GOING TO BE, WE'LL BE, YOU 
LOVE MY HAIR? 
THANK YOU. 
SHE KNOWS WHAT TO SAY. 
SHE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME HAPPY. 
I LOVE YOUR HAIR. 
WELL THE ONE THING THAT HAS 
BEEN REALLY GREAT ABOUT THIS 
WHOLE ENDEAVOR, THEY USED TO 
SAY, HE WEARS A HAIR PIECE. 
THEY DON'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN ME UNDER 
EVERY CONDITION KNOWNTO MAN. 
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE IN 
OVER A YEAR. 
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING AROUND, AND 
THE WIND IS GOING CRAZY, AND 
YOU'RE EXPECTING LIKE I DID THE 
OTHER DAY, THE INCREDIBLE 
HURRICANE. 
THIS HORRIBLE HURRICANE MICHAEL 
THAT DEVASTATED FLORIDA AND 
GEORGIA. 
AND ALABAMA GOT HIT HARD. 
AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE, 
AND MICHAEL GOT A PIECE OF THEM 
TOO, BUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
BEFORE I WENT TO NORTH 
CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA. 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN A 
LITTLE PIECE OF VIRGINIA AND 
YOU WALK AROUND IN THOSE 
CONDITIONS, YOU CAN'T FAKE IT. 
YOU CAN'T FAKE IT. 
SO THAT'S ONE GOOD THING. 
NOBODY EVER SAYS THAT ANYMORE. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE, MIGHT BE ONE 
OF THE BEST THINGS THAT'S 
HAPPENED TO ME IN A LONG TIME. 
BECAUSE MY WHOLE LIFE, THEY 
SAID IS IT OR ISN'T IT? 
BARBARA WALTERS INTERVIEWED ME, 
DO YOU MIND IF I PLAY WITH YOUR 
HAIR? 
REMEMBER THAT? 
AND THEN NUMEROUS PEOPLE HAVE 
DONE THAT. 
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 
BUT THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE 
MORE CLEAR. 
DEMOCRATS  
>> BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE MOST 
BEAUTIFUL SKY.  
WELL -- BIG SKY -- I GUESS 
THERE IS A REASON FOR 
EVERYTHING . I GOT OUT AND I'M 
LOOKING . I HAVE BEEN HERE MANY 
TIMES BUT I GOT OUT AND I AM 
LOOKING . THAT REALLY IS 
BEAUTIFUL . NOT JUST ME, IT IS 
BEAUTIFUL -- SKY . SOMEDAY, ONE 
OF YOU WILL EXPLAIN EXACTLY 
WHY, BUT THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL, 
BEAUTIFUL, BIG SKY.  
BUT, NANCY PELOSI, CRYING CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND THE RADICAL 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES, THEY WANT TO IMPOSE 
SOCIALISM ON OUR INCREDIBLE 
NATION, MAKE IT AN AS WELL, 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN . I WANT TO TAKE AWAY 
YOUR HEALTHCARE, BECAUSE YOU 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE IT, 
OUR COUNTRY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
AFFORD IT . DESTROY YOUR SECOND 
AMENDMENT, AND THROW OPEN YOUR 
BORDERS TO DEADLY DRUGS AND 
VICIOUS GANGS . BECAUSE PLENTY 
OF THEM ARE COMING ACROSS WITH 
A LOT OF DRUGS . DEMOCRATS HAVE 
BECOME THE PARTY OF CRIME . IT 
IS TRUE . WHO WOULD BELIEVE YOU 
COULD SAY THAT AND NOBODY EVEN 
CHALLENGES IT? 
NOBODY -- I SAID -- IT STARTED 
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO . I SAID 
ÃYOU KNOW, THEY HAVE REALLY 
BECOME THE PARTY OF CRIME . I 
SAID I'M GOING TO PUT THAT IN . 
I'M GOING TO SAY THAT IN ONE OF 
MY SPEECHES . NOBODY HAS EVER 
CHALLENGED IT . MAYBE YOU HAVE, 
WHO KNOWS . I HAVE TO SAY THAT 
BECAUSE -- THEY ACTUALLY DID 
CHALLENGE -- THEN, THEY WILL 
SAILÃHE GETS A PINOCCHIO . 
SO, MAYBE THEY DID CHALLENGE 
IT, BUT NOT VERY MUCH . IT HAS 
BECOME REALLY -- THEY HAVE 
BECOME THE PARTY OF CRIME 
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DO . THEY 
WOULD RATHER DEVASTATE AMERICAN 
COMMUNITIES THEN DEFEND 
AMERICA'S BORDERS . THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS BECOME TOO 
EXTREME TO BE TRUSTED WITH 
POWER. 
THEIR RADICAL  POLICIES ARE A 
DANGER TO YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR 
COUNTRY . IF YOU WANT TO DRAIN 
THE SWAMP, YOU MUST DEFEAT THE 
DEMOCRATS, AND YOU MUST DEFEAT 
SENATOR JON TESTER.  
 
>> I MEAN, HE IS A SUPER 
LIBERALÃHUNDRED PEOPLE . I 
WON BY A FORTUNE OF VOTES LIKE 
MANY -- I KNOW YOU, YOU KNOW ME 
. HOW THE DID YOU EVER LET THAT 
GUY? 
HOW DID YOU PULL THAT OFF? 
SO, WE ARE THRILLED TO BE 
JOINED TONIGHT BY SOMEBODY WHO 
HAS BEEN WORKING WITH ME, AND 
AN INCREDIBLE GUY, A GREAT 
HUMAN BEING . AND A VERY 
TALENTED SENATOR, BUT SOMEBODY 
THAT LOVES YOU, AND HE LOVES 
THE COUNTRY, SENATOR STEVE 
DAINES . STEVE? 
 HE IS A GREAT GUY 
. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU 
KNOW -- THE STRONG SILENT TYPE? 
THERE THE ONES THAT I LIKE THE 
BEST . I WANT TO BE THAT WAY 
SOMEDAY . STEVE DAINES HAS BEEN 
A GREAT REPRESENTATIVE, HE 
LOVES HIS STATE . ALSO WANT YOU 
TO GOING TO VOTE FOR AN 
INCREDIBLE MONTANA LEADER, 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS GONE TO 
CONGRESS, AND IN A SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME, ONE OF THE MOST 
RESPECTED PEOPLE IN CONGRESS, 
GREG G AND 40 ., PEER . 
 
>> THANK YOU, ESTER PRESIDENT . 
ÃMR. PRESIDENT . LET ME JUST 
SAY -- ON BEHALF OF ALL OF 
MONTANA, MR. PRESIDENT, THANK 
YOU FOR GIVING US HOPE AGAIN . 
 
>> THANK YOU . HE IS SO SMART . 
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ON LIVE 
TELEVISION ALL OVER THE PLACE . 
AND, WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE GET 
HAPPENS BEFORE 20-25 MINUTES . 
THESE GUYS ARE GOING CRAZY . 
BUT, GREG IS A SMART . AND, BY 
THE WAY, NEVER WRESTLE HIM . 
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? 
NEVER . ANY GUY THAT CAN DO A 
BODY SLAM, HE IS MY KIND -- 
 
>> HE IS MY GOD . -- GUY . THIS 
IS NOTHING TO BE EMBARRASSED 
ABOUT . SO, I WAS IN ROME WITH 
A LOT OF THE LEADERS FROM OTHER 
COUNTRIES TALKING ABOUT ALL 
SORTS OF THINGS . AND I HEARD 
ABOUT IT . AND, WE ENDORSED 
GREG VERY EARLY, BUT I HEARD 
THAT HE BODY SLAMMED A REPORTER 
. 
 
>> AND HE WAS WAY UP . HE WAS 
WAY UP AND I SAID THIS WAS LIKE 
THE DAY OF THE ELECTION, OR 
JUST BEFORE . I SAID OH, THIS 
IS TERRIBLE, HE IS GOING TO 
LOSE THE ELECTION THAT I SAID 
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE . I KNOW 
MONTANA PRETTY WELL . I THINK 
IT MIGHT HELP HIM . AND, IT DID.
NO, HE IS A GREAT GUY . A TOUGH 
COOKIE . GREG'S OPPONENT, 
KATHLEEN WILLIAMS -- 
  
>> -- IS A RADICAL FAR LEFT 
DEMOCRAT . SHE WILL BE VOTING 
WITH NANCY PELOSI AND MAXINE 
WATERS . THAT IS ANOTHER 
BEAUTY, ISN'T IT? 
WILLIAMS ONCE TO MASSIVELY 
RAISE YOUR TAXES, AND SHE 
SUPPORTS PELOSI'S CAP AND TRADE 
TAX, WHICH IS A DISASTER . AND 
IT WOULD KILL THE MONTANA COAL 
INDUSTRY THAT WE ALL REBUILT 
TOGETHER IN EACH -- IN A SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME . ANY MINORS IN 
THE AUDIENCE? 
YOU GUYS ARE HAPPY, RIGHT? 
YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT . IT 
IS COMING BACK . CLEAN COAL, IS 
A BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL . AND, 
WE HAVE MORE OF IT THAN ANYBODY 
. AND, KATHLEEN WILLIAMS 
SUPPORTS OPEN BORDERS . SHE 
OPPOSES THE WALL, WHICH WE HAVE 
STARTED, AND WE HAVE DONE A LOT 
OF WORK ON IT, BUT I WOULD LIKE 
TO GET IT DONE QUICKLY . GIVE 
US THE MONEY, AND WE WILL DO IT 
FAST . BUT, WE STARTED IT WE 
GOT 1.6 BILLION, 1.6 BILLION, 
AND 1.6 BILLION . I WANT TO GET 
IT FINISHED . IF THIS SCENE OF 
PEOPLE POURING UPÃIF THAT IS 
NOT MAKE PEOPLE TO BUILDÃYOU 
KNOW, WHEN -- IN 2006, THESE 
PEOPLE, JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEM, 
THEY WANTED A WALL . THEY KNOW 
IT IS THE RIGHT THING . THEY 
JUST DO NOT WANT TO GIVE US THE 
VICTORY . IT IS NOT LIKE 
SCHUMER SAYS OH, JAILÃYOU 
KNOW, ISRAEL HAS A WALL . MAYBE 
NETANYAHU -- HE SAID AT WORK 
99.9%, THERE WILL . THEY HAVE A 
BIG WALL . IT IS IN THE FORM OF 
A VERY TOUGH DEFENSE . BUT, 
THEY HAVE A WALL . AND SCHUMER 
KNOWS THIS AND NANCY PELOSI 
KNOWS THIS . THEY DO NOT WANT 
TO GIVE US THE -- I KNOW FOR A 
FACT, THEY SAID WE CANNOT LET 
THEM HAVE THE WALL, THAT WOULD 
BE ANOTHER CAMPAIGN PROMISE 
FULFILLED . BUT, I HAVE DONE SO 
MANYÃI AM SO FAR AHEAD -- 
BUT, WE STARTED THE WALL, AND 
IT IS MOVING AND WE ARE GOING 
TO GET IT, BUT GET ME 
REPUBLICAN VOTES, PLEASE . 
KATHLEEN WILLIAMS VOTED IN 
FAVOR OF DEADLY SANCTUARY 
CITIES AND IN FAVOR OF GIVING 
PUBLIC BENEFITS  TO ILLEGAL 
ALIENS .0, THAT IS A BEAUTY . 
TO THE PEOPLE OF MONTANA LIKE 
THE IDEA OF GIVING PUBLIC 
BENEFITS TO ILLEGALS? 
I DO NOT THINK SO . I KNOW YOU 
VERY WELL . MY SON IS YOUR ALL 
THE TIME, DON . HE IS A BIG FAN 
. HE IS A HUNTER . HE IS A 
HUNTER . A BIG FAN OF GREG'S . 
A BIG FAN OF GREG'S . HE IS A 
GOOD HUNTER, THAT ONE . YOU 
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE IT . HE 
GREW UP IN A CERTAIN NICE 
LOCATION IN NEW YORK, LIKE 
FIFTH AVENUE . HE KNOWS MORE 
ABOUT HUNTING AND GUNS AND 
RIFLES ANDÃMAYBE MORE THAN 
ANYBODY HERE . THAT IS A CRAZY 
THING -- THAT IS WHAT HE LOVES 
. A FEW PEOPLE OVER THERE SAY I 
DISAGREE WITH THAT . BUT, HE 
DOES WELL . GREG WILL TELL YOU 
THAT . BUT, EVERYBODY HAS TO GO 
OUT AND VOTE FOR GREG . AND 
FINALLYÃIT IS MY GREAT HONOR 
TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT UNITED 
STATES SENATOR FROM MONTANA, 
MATT ROSEN DELL . 
 
COME ON UP, MATT . COME ON UP . 
A GREAT GUY, GREAT SUCCESS, 
HIGHLY RESPECTED . 
 
>> GOOD EVENING MONTANA . 
PRESIDENT TRUMP  IS MAKING 
HISTORY AGAIN HERE IN MONTANA, 
BY GOLLY.  
THIS IS HIS THIRD TRIP TO 
MONTANA AND THAT DOES SET A 
RECORD . THIS IS ONE FOR THE 
HISTORY BOOKS AGAIN . I WANT TO 
TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK OUR 
VETERANS, AND ALL OF OUR 
MILITARY FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE
TO OUR GREAT NATION . 
 
YOU KEPT YOUR PROMISES, AND I 
WILL WORK TIRELESSLY EVERY DAY 
TO MAKE GOOD ON THE PROMISES 
THAT OUR NATION MADE TO YOU . 
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR SUPPORT, AND FOR KEEPING 
YOUR PROMISES TO THE PEOPLE OF 
MONTANA . YOU ARE MAKING 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN . AND IF WE 
WANT TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT, 
THEN WE NEED EVERYONE HERE TO 
GET OUT AND VOTE . 
 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ALL OF HIS 
POLICIES ARE ON THE LINE . SO, 
LET'S MAKE HISTORY AND RETIRE 
JOHN TESTER AND SEND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP  THE HELP HE NEEDS.  
LET'S REMEMBER, IT WAS JOHN 
TESTER THAT CAST THE DECIDING 
VOTE ON OBAMACARE, AND GOT YOUR 
PREMIUMS SKYROCKETING . 
 
>> I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON 
REPEALING AND REPLACING 
OBAMACARE . 
 
WE MUST HAVE HEALTHCARE THAT WE 
CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD, AND I WILL 
MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS PROTECT 
THOSE WITH PRE-EXISTING 
CONDITIONS . REMEMBER, WHEN JON 
TESTER TALKS ABOUT SUPPORTING 
THE SECOND AMENDMENT,  REMEMBER 
THAT HE VOTED FOR LIBERAL 
JUDGES WHO WILL TAKE YOUR GUNS 
AWAY . 
I AM ENDORSED BY THE NRA WITH A 
LETTER A RATING . AND ALL JON 
TESTER COULD MUSTER UP  WAS A D 
. THAT RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.
JON TESTER DOES NOT STAND WITH 
US ON BORDER SECURITY. 
HE SUPPORTS AMNESTY,  CATCH AND 
RELEASE, AND SANCTUARY CITIES. 
 
I AM RUNNING TO HELP OUR 
PRESIDENT SECURE THE BORDER 
DEPORT THE CRIMINALS, AND 
SANCTUARY CITIES, AND BUILD-
THAT-WALL. 
 
THEY ARE GOING TO BUILD IT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP DESERVES A 
SENATOR FROM MONTANA  THAT WILL 
SUPPORT HIS SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES, NOT OPPOSE THEM 100% 
OF THE TIME LIKE JON TESTER HAS 
DONE.  
NO THANKS TO JON TESTER,  WE 
NOW HAVE TWO GOOD MEN INTO 
GREAT JUDGES ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
NEIL COURSE SUCH AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH.  
FOLKS -- JON TESTER HAS BEEN  
TO WRONG FOR TOO LONG. 
WE CANNOT LET JON TESTER  AND 
THE RADICAL, LIBERAL RESISTANCE 
WIN THIS NOVEMBER. 
IF THEY WIN, THEY WILL GO AFTER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP  AND HIS 
AGENDA. 
WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. 
WE NEED EVERYONE IN THIS HANGAR 
AND ACROSS THE STATE TO GET UP 
AND DO THEIR PART TO WIN THIS 
RACE. 
 
BALLOTS HAVE DROPPED, ENCOURAGE 
EVERYONE TO PLEASE, CAST YOUR 
VOTE AND TURN THEM IN AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE. 
TELL YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR FAMILY, 
AND YOUR NEIGHBORS TO GET OUT 
AND VOTE.  
I PLEDGE TO ALWAYS PUT MONTANA 
FIRST, AND I WILL STAND IN 
STRONG SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP  BECAUSE THE WORK THAT HE 
IS DOING REALLY IS MAKING 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
 
THANK YOU, MONTANA. 
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
MAY GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERYONE 
OF YOU,  AND THESE GREAT UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. 
 
 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, MATT. 
AND, I HAVE TO SAY A VOTE FOR 
TESTER IS A VOTE THAT REALLY IS 
GOING TO COUNT, IT IS GOING TO 
COUNT FOR YOU. 
HE IS REPLACING FAR LEFT WITH 
COMMON SENSE AND WE REALLY HAVE 
TO GET OUT. 
WE ARE LOOKING TO HAVE SOME 
SUCCESS WHERE RIGHT NOW IT IS 
SO IMPOSSIBLE. 
WE HAVE TO GET SCHUMER AND 
PELOSI -- WE HAVE TO MOVE THEM 
AROUND, WE HAVE TO GET THEM 
OUT. 
OUR NEW STAR, MAXINE, WE HAVE 
TO GET THEM OUT THERE ARE BAD 
THINGS HAPPENING. 
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE 
WHAT THEY DO, YOU SEE WHAT THEY 
THINK IT ALMOST A LIKEÃCAN IT 
REALLY POSSIBLE? 
CAN SOMETHING NOT CARE ABOUT 
HER MILITARY? 
CAN CITY NOT CARE ABOUT SO MANY 
OTHER THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING, 
LIKE TO CARE OF OUR VETERANS? 
I MEAN, CAN SOMEBODY -- NOT 
CARE ABOUT TAX CUTS? 
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES 
AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT 
CRIME, THINK ABOUT THAT. 
RAISE YOUR TAXES, AND THEY 
DON'T CARE ABOUT CRIME. 
IS THAT REALLY SOME WAY TO GET 
ELECTED? 
HOW DO YOU DO THAT? 
I WOULD EVER BE A POLITICIAN IF 
THAT WERE MY PLATFORM, I TELL 
YOU. 
I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE 
SUCCESSFUL. 
BUT, JON TESTER SAYS ONE THING 
TO VOTERS, AND ALWAYS IS THE 
EXACT OPPOSITE.  
IN WASHINGTON, HE TALKS LIKE HE 
IS FROM MONTANA. 
AND HE VOTES LIKE HE IS NANCY 
PELOSI. 
THE ONLY THING KEEPING TESTER'S 
CAMPAIGN ALIVE ARE MILLIONS AND 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM 
OUTSIDE LIBERALS AND RADICAL 
LEFTISTS, WHO COULD NOT CARE 
LESS ABOUT MONTANA. THEY DO NOT 
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MONTANA. 
ALL THAT THEY KNOW IS THAT HE 
IS A VOTE FOR THEM. 
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. 
THEY DID NOT COME HERE TO TALK 
TO YOU. 
THEY JUST SENT A LOT OF MONEY. 
THIS CRAZY. 
TESTER VOTED AGAINST TAX CUTS 
FOR MONTANA FAMILIES WHERE YOU 
BENEFITED SO MUCH. 
A KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT HAS 
BEEN. 
AND HE VOTED FOR OBAMA'S JOB 
KILLING REGULATIONS.  
WITH THOSE REGULATIONS, ALL OF 
YOUR ENERGY THAT YOU TAKE OUT 
OF THE GROUND IN THE CLEANEST 
WAY, AND THAT MAKES OUR NATION 
WEALTHY, YOU COULD NOT DO IT. 
HE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO 
IT. 
ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
HERE, ALL OF THE STEELWORKERS, 
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE YOUR JOBS 
BACK. 
HE WOULD NOT HAVE JOBS. 
WE WERE GOING IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION. 
WHEN I CAME IN, WE WERE GOING 
DOWN, AND NOW WE JUST HIT 4.2, 
AND EVER BUT HE SAID HOW DID 
THAT HAPPEN? 
GDP, 4.2. 
AND ON IMMIGRATION, TESTERS 
RECORD CAN BE SUMMARIZED IN 2 
SIMPLE WORDS, OPEN BORDERS, 
OPEN BORDERS, THINK ABOUT IT. 
THINK ABOUT IT. 
 
>> ABOUT THIS GUY IN 
CALIFORNIA.  
HAVE TO SAYÃI'M SURE THAT HE 
IS IN A SKY. 
NICE GUY, YOUNG GUY, THEY SAY 
SOME TO HE WAS TO BE PRESIDENT 
.0, PLEASE, LET HIM RUN. 
BUT, HOW ABOUT THIS FOR RUNNING 
FOR GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. 
HE WANTS OPEN BORDERS, AND THEY 
WANT TO TAKE CARE OF 
EVERYBODY'S HEALTHCARE, 
EVERYBODY'S MEDICAL COSTS, 
RIGHT? 
HE WANTS TO PUT MORE GAS TAXES 
ON WHERE THEY JUST HAVE A LOT. 
BUT, HE WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF 
EVERYBODY. 
SO, OPEN BORDERS, THE WHOLE 
WORLD IS GOING TO GO TO 
CALIFORNIA. 
AND, THEY OWE ABOUT 15 ZILLION 
DOLLARS. 
THEY OWE MORE MONEY THAN THAT 
HE KNOWS. 
IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM. 
AND, HE IS ASKING FOR THE IN 
THE WORLD, JUST COME ON IN, 
OPEN BORDERS, WE ARE GOING TO 
TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH CARE. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF 
YOUR SCHOOLS, WE ARE GOING TO 
TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. 
I MEAN -- IS -- I MEAN -- GIVE 
ME A BREAK. 
RIGHT? 
NO, I SAW THIS PLATFORM THE 
OTHER DAY -- WE HAVE A GOOD 
CANDIDATE THERE ALSO. 
YOU ARE RIGHT, THANK YOU, 
DARLING. 
WE HAVE A GOOD CANDIDATE THERE. 
HE IS -- NOW, IT IS HARD FOR A 
REPUBLICAN TO WIN A CALIFORNIA, 
BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME LIKE -- 
CRAZY. 
BUT, ALL OF A SUDDEN 
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING BIG 
PROGRESS. 
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY 
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS. 
 
BUT THAT IS WHERE JON TESTER IS 
COMING FROM. 
HE VOTED FOR  AMNESTY FOR 
ILLEGALS. 
AND, AGAINST A BORDER WALL ON 
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. 
HE VOTED TO LET DRUGS IN, HE 
VOTED TO LET DRUGS IN. 
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING 
PRETTY DO NOT HAVE THE WALL, 
YOU DO NOT HAVE A BORDER. 
WHAT YOU HAVE IS INFILTRATION 
OF DRUGS LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER 
SEEN. 
WE FIGHT SO HARD. 
WE JUST HAD A BIG VICTORY WITH 
THE POST OFFICE, SO THAT WE 
COULD SEE DRUGS COMING IN FROM 
CHINA. 
FENTANYL, AND OTHER PLACES. 
TESTER VOTED AGAINST CASELAW, 
LEGISLATION TO STOP CRIMINAL -- 
ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM REPEATEDLY 
BREAKING INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
THIS GUY CAME IN FIVE TIMES, 
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? 
TESTER VOTED AGAINST ENHANCED 
VETTING FOR REFUGEES. 
I SAID ENHANCED VETTING AND 
PEOPLE SAID WHAT A TERRIBLEÃI 
DON'T THINK IT IS TERRIBLE. 
WE WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE COME 
INTO THE COUNTRY. 
BUT, THEY HAVE TO COME IN BASED 
ON MERIT, NOT BASED ON A 
LOTTERY. 
 
WE NEED PEOPLE. 
WE NEED PEOPLE.  
OUR EMPLOYMENT RATE IS ONE OF 
THE LOWEST, AS I SAID, OVER 50 
YEARS. 
WE NEED PEOPLE TO WORK IN THE 
COMPANIES. 
JAPAN -- I WAS SPEAKING TO 
PRIME MINISTER THE OTHER DAY. 
THEY ARE OPENING UP NEW CAR 
FACTORIES AND PLANTS IN 
MICHIGAN, IN OHIO, AND 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
IN KENTUCKY. 
AT MY VERY STRONG URGING, 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE 
DEFICIT, WHICH -- WE HAVE A 
MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH 
EVERYBODY. 
BUT, WE ARE CHANGING IT. 
WE MADE A GREAT DEAL FOR THE 
FARMERS. 
WITH CANADA AND WITH MEXICO. 
 
IN EVERY OTHER BUSINESS, BY THE 
WAY. 
AND, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE 
OUR COMPANIES LEAVING THE 
UNITED STATES ANYMORE. 
THEY'RE GOING TO STAY HERE, AND 
THEY'RE GOING TO EXPAND IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
 
AND TESTER VOTED IN FAVOR OF 
DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES, HE 
LIKES SANCTUARY CITIES. 
JON TESTER WOULD RATHER PROTECT 
CRIMINAL ALIENS  THAN AMERICAN 
CITIZENS, WHICH IS WHY HE NEEDS 
TO BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE, HE 
DOES. 
AND BY THE WAY, MATT -- MATT -- 
HE IS A REALLY SUCCESSFUL GUY. 
RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY. 
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM FROM 
10 YEARS AGO. 
LONG BEFORE HE EVER THOUGHT OF 
THIS. 
20 YEARS AGO, HE WAS JUST ALWAYS
A HIGH AND, REALLY RESPECTED 
GUY. 
AND, HE IS GOING TO BE A GREAT 
SENATOR FOR YOU. 
HE IS GOING TO BE A GREAT 
SENATOR.  
MATT ROSEN DALE -- AND MATT 
SAID -- TESTER HAS A D-RATING 
FROM THE NRA. 
I DID NOT KNOW THEY GAVE 
RATINGS THAT LOW. 
HOW CAN YOU HAVE -- OKAY, ARE 
YOU READY? 
WE ARE IN MONTANA. 
HOW CAN YOU HAVE A DEEP D 
RATING. 
AND GET VOTES? 
NO, SERIOUSLY. 
I KNOW ABOUT THAT ELECTION.  
THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT YOU 
CAN HAVE A D-RATING I GUESS. 
BUT, HE HAS A D-RATING AND 
MONTANA. 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS GOING TO 
LAST LONG. 
AND HE VOTED ABOUT LIBERAL 
OBAMA JUDGES, WHO WANT TO TAKE 
AWAY YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. 
THEY DO WANT TO TAKE AWAY, JUST 
IN CASE YOU HAVE NOT FIGURED 
THAT ONE OUT, THAT IS A TOUGH 
ONE. 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL 
BE HAPPENING -- YOU KNOW, WE 
ARE HAPPENÃWE HAVE TO GREAT 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WE JUST 
PUT ON. 
YOU KNOW, PRESIDENTS GO A LONG 
TIME. 
THE NEVER HAD A JUDGE, I HAD TO 
ÃIT IS 92 YEARS, THINK ABOUT. 
THINK OF -- 
BUT, ANDERSON AREAS, WE COULD 
HAVE TWO MORE, THREE MORE -- 
 
MAYBE 4 MORE. 
I WISH EVERYBODY GREAT HEALTH, 
I DO I REALLY DO, BUT YOU KNOW 
ÃWE CAN HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE 
WE HAVE MORE. 
THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE TO BE 
CAREFUL. 
BECAUSE, YOU THINK THAT THE 2 
IS GOOD, THAT CAN GET OVER VERY 
QUICKLY. 
YOU THINK YOU ARE LOOKING GOOD, 
BUT -- AND, YOU ARE. 
BUT, FRANKLY -- IT CAN BE OVER 
VERY QUICKLY. 
JON TESTER  JOINED THE SHAMEFUL 
DEMOCRAT MOB, AND WE ARE 
CALLING IT A MOB NOW. 
WHILE PEOPLE ARE CALLING -- 
THESE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO 
THINK OF IT AS A MILD. 
THEY VOTED AGAINST BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, THEY VOTED AGAINST  
-- I GUESS, I DID NOT EVEN KNOW 
-- DID HE VOTE AGAINST -- 
JUSTICE CORSETS? 
-- GORSUCH? 
HOW DO YOU VOTE AGAINST THEM? 
RIGHT?  
TOP STUDENT AT HARVARD, TOP 
STUDENT IN COLUMBIA, TOP 
STUDENT AT OXFORD.  
OXFORD -- AND, THE VOTE AGAINST 
HIM? 
HOW DO YOU DO THAT? 
AND, HE IS JUST LIKE -- LANDED 
AN IMPECCABLE LIFE. 
JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH -- 
NUMBER ONE IN HIS CLASS AT 
YALE.  
I MEAN, THERE ISÃTHESE ARE 
EXTERNALLY PEOPLE. 
THEY HAD A GREAT LIFE. 
IT IS NOT ABOUT GRADES OR 
MARKS, OR -- IT IS -- IT ISÃ
IT IS ONE THING. 
BUT -- BUT, THESE PEOPLE, THEY 
LET INCREDIBLE LIVES. 
AND, IN THE CASE -- ESPECIALLY, 
OF JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE 
LIES  THAT THEY MADE UP, THE 
STORIES THAT CAME OUT. 
AND, HE DIDN'T -- YOU HONESTLY 
ÃI'M PRETTY GOOD AT THE STUFF, 
HE HONESTLY NEVER HEARD OF THE 
STUFF. 
HE NEVER HEARD OF IT. 
IT WAS A BIG CON JOB.  
YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT. 
IT WAS A CON JOB. 
SEE, WITH ME, THEY ARE DOING 
CON JOBS ALSO, BUT AT LEAST I 
-- MY WHOLE LIFE, I HAVE BEEN 
-- PEOPLE -- I EXPECT LIKEÃ
THINGS LIKE THIS. 
THEY GIVE IT A BIG -- YOU KNOW, 
WITCHHUNT. 
THEY'RE DOING A BIG CON JOB. 
BUT, ON HIM, I DON'T THINK HE 
WAS EXPECTING THAT. 
WHEN I SAID -- WHEN I SHOOK HIS 
HAND, I HAVE TO TELL YOU I HAVE 
NEVER TOLD US, SHOOK HIS HAND. 
AND I SAID -- BRETT, 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
I HAVE CHOSEN YOU. 
AND, I HAVE A LIST OF 23 PEOPLE 
OR SO THAT ARE PHENOMENAL TOP 
STUDENTS, TOP EVERYTHING. 
TOP JUDGES, ALL JUDGES I THINK. 
ALL JUDGES. 
IT IS NOT HAVE TO BE A JUDGE BY 
THE WAY. 
BUT, THERE IS NOTHING IS ABOUT 
PUTTING JUDGES ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
SOMEHOW -- I THINK THAT PUTTING 
A BUSINESSMAN WOULD BE NICE, OR 
A WOMAN. 
HOW ABOUT A BUSINESSWOMAN? 
 
BUT, SOMETHING IS ABOUT JUDGE 
-- IT IS NOT HAVE TO BE A 
JUDGE, WOULD YOU BELIEVE? 
BUT, I SAIDÃI SHOOK HIS HAND, 
NEVER FORGET IT, SHOOK HIS HAND 
AND I SAID BRETT, YOU ARE LIKE 
-- SO GOOD. 
EDUCATIONALLY -- YOUR A GREAT 
SCHOLAR, YOU ARE A GREAT -- YOU 
ARE TALENTED, INCREDIBLE WIFE.  
INCREDIBLE DAUGHTERS.  
YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN AMAZING. 
DO NOT FORGET, SIX CHECKS UNTIL 
THE SEVENTH FROM THE FBI. 
FLAWLESS. 
I SAID -- CONGRATULATIONS. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE A PIECE OF 
CAKE. 
I MEANT IT. 
I SAID THIS IS GOING TO GO SO 
FAST. 
IT IS GOING TO BE SO EASY. 
YOU ARE PERFECT. 
YOU ARE SOMETHING SPECIAL.  
AND HE SUFFERED. 
HE SUFFERED. 
NEEDLESSLY. 
BY VICIOUS PEOPLE.  
LIKE -- FEINSTEIN, LIKE -- 
  
YOU THINK SHE LEAKED? 
SHE LEAKED. 
SHE LEAKED. 
REMEMBER THAT? 
NO, I -- I DEFINITELY, 
REMEMBER, REMEMBER? 
SENATOR JON CORNYN, GREAT GUY 
FROM TEXAS. 
HE ASKED THE QUESTION --  DID 
YOU LEAVE? 
SHE'LLÃSHE WAS STARTLED, 
BECAUSE SHE WAS UNPREPARED. 
NO, I -- KNOW. 
I -- I DID NOT -- DID LEAK? 
NO. 
NOW, WE DO NOT LEAK. 
NO, NO, WE DID NOT LEAK. 
NOW, THAT WAS THE WORST BODY 
LINE WHICH I THINK THAT I HAVE 
EVER SEEN. 
 
NUMBER, REMEMBER JON LEVITZ, 
THE  LIAR, REMEMBER JON  
LEVITZ? 
YEAH. 
I HE BUSINESSMAN, THAT IS RIGHT.
I -- I WANT TO -- YEAH.  
YEAH. 
I WENT TO HARVARD. 
YEAH. 
THAT IS RIGHT. 
I WENT TO HARVARD. 
I BUSINESSMAN. 
THAT WAS LIKE -- IF YOU KNOW 
VERSION OF JON LEVITZ.  
AND THEN HE HAD SPARTACUS, 
RIGHT? 
THAT IS NOT SPARTACUS. 
I KNOW HIM FOR A LONG TIME. 
AND, YOU KNOW. 
I DO NOT WANT TO SPEAK BADLY 
ABOUT HIM THOUGH, BECAUSE I 
WANT -- YOU KNOW, MOST OF THESE 
PEOPLE. 
I THINK ALL OF THEM. 
I WANT THEM TO GET TO THE 
PROCESS. 
AND, THEY ARE TRYING TO RUN 
AGAINST IS. 
AND, DO NOT WANT TO RUN THEM SO 
HARD THAT THEY DO NOT MAKE IT. 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THEY 
WILL FIND SOMEBODY OF TALENT. 
SO FAR, THERE IS NOBODY ON THE 
LIST. 
SO, DO NOT WANT TO KILL THEM. 
I DO NOT WANT TO DO IT, IT IS 
TOO EARLY TO BE DOING IT. 
BUT, HE DID NOT DO WELL ENOUGH 
IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. 
HE RAN IT RIGHT INTO THE 
GROUND. 
AND, THAT IS WHAT HE WOULD DO 
WITH OUR COUNTRY. 
SO, YOU HAVE A LOT OF THEM. 
I WILL GO OVER A COUPLE 
MORNINGS. 
BUT, NO I WANT. 
HOW ABOUTÃHOW ABOUT SLEEPY 
JOE BIDEN? 
SLEEPY-JOE. 
 
REMEMBER, HE CHALLENGED ME TO A 
FIGHT, AND THAT WAS FINE. 
AND, WHEN I SAID HE WOULD NOT 
LAST LONG, HE WOULD BE DOWN 
FASTER THAN GREG WOULD TAKE HIM 
DOWN. 
 
HE WOULD BE DOWN SO FAST -- 
REMEMBER, -- FASTER, I WOULD 
HAVE -- I WOULD HAVE TO GO VERY 
FAST. 
I WOULD HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY BE 
LIKE -- BUT, SO HE CHALLENGES 
ME TO A FIGHT IN THE FAKE NEWS 
SAID OH, ISN'T THAT CUTE? 
THAT IS A WONDERFUL, RUBBER HE 
SAIDÃYOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE 
THE BEHIND THE BARN IF YOU ARE 
YOUNGER. 
BUT, YOU KNOW -- SO, HE 
CHALLENGES ME TO A FIGHT, AND 
IT IS FINE. 
AND I SAID HE SHOULDN'T DO 
THAT, BECAUSE I WOULD TAKEN 
DOWN SO FAST, AND THEY SAIDÃ
WHAT A VICIOUS STATEMENT MADE. 
HOW VICIOUS. 
HE IS TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING. 
WHAT A VICIOUS -- AND, CAN YOU 
BELIEVE THIS? 
THAT IS WHY IT IS THE FAKE 
NEWS. 
 
REMEMBER? 
I RESPONDED SO NICELY, THEY -- 
THEY MADE A BIG DEAL, BUT THAT 
IS OKAY. 
AND JON TESTER LED THE DEMOCRAT 
MOB IN THE EFFORT TO DESTROY 
THE REPUTATION OF A GREAT MAN, 
ADMIRAL RONNIE JACKSON. 
NOW, ADMIRAL JACKSON, I GOT TO 
KNOW WELL. 
HE IS A DOCTOR, IN ADDITION TO 
BEING AN ADMIRAL. 
HE IS A HANDSOME, WONDERFUL, 
FATHER, HIS SON JUST GRADUATED 
HIGH IN HIS CLASS AT ANNAPOLIS, 
A CREDIBLE YOUNG MAN. 
BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, INCREDIBLE 
WIFE. 
AND TESTER SAID THINGS ABOUT 
HIM WHICH WERE A DISGRACE. 
AND I SAY THE PEOPLE OF MONTANA 
WOULD NOT STAND FOR IT.  
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT RONNIE 
JACKSON, HE WAS THE DOCTOR FOR 
PRESIDENT BUSH? 
FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
AND, HE WAS HIGH QUALITY. 
AND, IT IS MY FAULT. 
I SAID -- ADMIRAL -- HOW WOULD 
YOU LIKE TO HEAD UP THE VA? 
I WAS GREAT, YOU ARE AN 
ADMIRAL, YOU'RE A LEADER. 
AND, HE IS 50 YEARS OLD. 
HE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM IN HIS 
WHOLE LIFE. 
A LITTLE BIT LIKE -- JUSTICE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
YOU KNOW, REALLY -- A VERY FINE 
HIGH-QUALITY, HANDSOME GUY. 
NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. 
AND HE SAID SIR, I NEVER 
THOUGHT OF IT, BUT I WILL DO 
WHATEVER YOUR WISH IS SIR. 
EVEN THOUGHÃHE DID NOT REALLY 
WANTED. 
AND, HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN 
QUALIFIED, BUT HE IS A DOCTOR 
AT A HIGH LEVEL. 
AND HE IS A MAN THAT EVER BUT 
HE RESPECTED. 
I SAW THAT. 
I RESPECTED -- THAT IS SO 
IMPORTANT. 
AND, THAT HE WOULD DO A GOOD 
JOB. 
AND, HE WOULD PUT HIS HEART 
INTO IT. 
HE IS VERY SMART. 
BUT, HE SAIDÃOR, IF YOU WANT 
ME TO DO IT -- HE REALLY 
DIDN'T, HE WAS ALL OF THIS IS 
50 YEARS OLD -- HE WAS GOING TO 
GET A SECOND STAR, HE WAS GOING 
TO RETIRE AND GO INTO RUNNING 
IN A BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEM OR 
SOMETHING. 
HE WAS ALL SAD, BUT HE DID NOT 
WANT TO DISAPPOINT ME. 
SO, HE SAID SIR, IF YOU WOULD 
LIKE ME TO DO IT, I WILL DO IT. 
I SETTLEÃWELL, I WILL TELL 
YOU WHAT, RONNIE, YOU WILL BE 
FANTASTIC. 
YOU WILL DO A GREAT JOB. 
AND -- I ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS 
GOING TO BE MY CHOICE AND HE 
WAS ATTACKED SO VICIOUSLY, SO 
VIOLENTLY BY JON TESTER ,  LIKE 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. 
 
ALL LIES, ALL MADE UP STUFF. 
THE NUMBER, KNOCKING AT 
SOMEBODY'S DOOR. 
AT 2 IN THE MORNING, REMEMBER 
THAT? 
KNOCKING. 
AND, I CHECKED WITH SECRET 
SERVICE DID IT HAPPEN? 
NO SIR, IT DIDN'T. 
THEY CHECKED IT, NO SIR, THAT 
DID NOT HAVE AN. 
THEY CAN COME I WANT TO KNOW. 
SIR, IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 
DID NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO 
HAVING. 
I THINK THAT HE WAS NOT EVEN 
THERE. 
THEY MADE UP A SERIES OF LIES 
THAT WERE HORRIBLE. 
AND JON TESTER  LED THE GROUP. 
THAT IS REALLY WHY I AM HERE. 
IT IS NOT THAT WE NEED TO VOTE 
SO BADLY. 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO VERY 
NICELY IN THE SENATE I HOPE I 
THINK THAT WE SHOULD PICK UP A 
SEAT. 
BUT, FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE A LOT 
OF RESPECT FOR THE MAN THAT IS 
RUNNING. 
 
ALSO HERE BECAUSE I CANNOT 
FORGET WHAT JON TESTER  DID TO 
AN END THAT IS OF THE HIGHEST 
QUALITY. 
HE WOULD BE ONE OF YOU, HE 
WOULD BE ONE OF YOU. 
SO, I SAID I HAVE TO COME HERE, 
HAVE TO HELP. 
BECAUSE, WHAT HE DID WAS 
UNFAIR. 
WHAT HE -- WHAT HE DID WAS 
VICIOUS. 
WHAT HE DID WAS AS THEY DID 
WITH JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
THE SAME THING. 
THE SAME THING. 
ALMOST. 
ALMOST IF THIS IS BELIEVABLE 
WORSE AND HE SAT AND HE DID NOT 
KNOW WHAT HIT HIM.  
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HIT HIM. 
TWO WHICH I ORIGINALLY SAID, 
WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF 
WASHINGTON DC, IS THIS NOT A 
LOVELY PLACE? 
BUT, THIS WAS AN INNOCENT, 
WONDERFUL MAN WHO HAS A LIFE 
THAT IS INCREDIBLE. 
AND, HE WAS SO BADLY HURT, SO I 
HAD TO COME HERE AND TELL YOU 
THAT STORY. 
WHAT HAPPENEDÃAND, WE HAVE 
HAD IT CHECKED OUT SO 
CAREFULLY. 
AND, THE SECRET SERVICE GUYS 
ARE FANTASTIC. 
AND, I WANTED A FULL REPORT. 
I WANTED A FULL REPORT. 
 
DR. RONNIE JACKSON, A SPECIAL 
MAN. 
TESTER DOES NOT SHARE YOUR 
THOUGHTS. 
HE SHOWS THE VALUES OF THE 
FEINSTEIN'S AND THE COREY 
WORKERS, AND HOW ABOUT 
POCAHONTAS, ELIZABETH WARREN? 
 
YOU KNOW, THE ONE GOOD THING 
ABOUT HER TEST -- IS THAT THERE 
WAS A LITTLE, SHE HAD LESS THAN 
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. 
I USED TO SAY I HAVE MORE 
INDIAN BLOOD IN ME THAN SHE 
DOES AND I HAVE NONE. 
DAYS TO SAY -- AND I WAS RIGHT. 
BUT THE ONLY GOOD THING SHE 
DIDN'T THINK SHE PROBABLY 
DISQUALIFIED, BECAUSE SHE MADE 
A FOOL OUT OF HERSELF, BUT THE 
ONLY GOOD THING SHE DID -- I 
CANNOT CALL HER POCAHONTAS 
ANYMORE. 
RIGHT? 
I CAME UP WITH -- THE NAME 
POCAHONTAS, AND THEY ONCE SAID 
-- YOU MUST APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. 
I SAID WHY? 
WELL, IT IS NOT NICE, WHAT YOU 
ARE DOING. 
I SETTLEÃOKAY. 
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO 
THE REAL POCAHONTAS. 
BUT, NOT TO THE FAKE -- NOT THE 
FAKE POCAHONTAS. 
AND TO THE FAKE POCAHONTAS. 
BUT, IT IS TRUE. 
SHE HAS SO LITTLE INDIAN BLOOD, 
SHE HAS NONE. 
I CANNOT CALL HER POCAHONTAS 
ANYMORE. 
BUT, IF YOU DO NOT MIND I WILL 
CONTINUE, DO YOU MIND? 
BECAUSE, IT WILL SHOW EVERYBODY 
WHAT A PHONY SHE IS.  
IF YOU VOTE TO ELECT A 
REPUBLICAN HOUSE, AND A 
REPUBLICAN SENATE, WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO CUT YOUR TAXES, CUT 
YOUR REGULATIONS, RAISE YOUR 
INCOME, AND MAKE OUR COUNTRY 
GREAT AGAIN. 
THAT IS HAPPENING. 
 
WE WILL PROTECT MEDICARE AND 
SOCIAL SECURITY. 
AND DEMOCRATS WILL DESTROY YOUR 
SOCIAL SECURITY, AND THEY WILL 
DESTROY YOUR MEDICARE. 
WE WILL CONTINUE CONFIRMING 
JUDGES WHO INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. 
WE WILL FULLY SECURE THE 
BORDER, WE WILL PASS KATES LAW 
STOP SANCTUARY CITIES STOP THE 
VISA LOTTERY AND CHAIN MIGRATION
AND WE WILL KEEP THE CRIMINAL 
DRUG DEALERS AND TERRORISTS THE 
OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
 
WE WILL LEFT MILLIONS FROM 
WELFARE TO WORK, DEPENDENCE TO 
INDEPENDENCE AND POVERTY TO 
PROSPERITY. 
 
FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 
THE APOLOGISTS. 
NOW, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO 
IS STANDING UP AND PROUD. 
AND STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR MONTANA, 
AND WE ARE PROBABLY STANDING UP 
FOR OUR GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
BUT, TO CONTINUE THIS 
INCREDIBLE MOMENTUM, I NEED YOU 
TO GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR 
FAMILY, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS, GET 
YOUR COWORKERS, AND GET OUT AND 
VOTE FOR GREG GIANFORTE  AND 
MATT ROSENDALE, THESE ARE GREAT 
PEOPLE.  
A VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESS IS A VOTE FOR MORE 
JOBS, MORE WEALTH, AND MORE 
PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT HERE, LIKE 
THE OLD DAYS IN THE USA. 
IT IS A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR 
LAWS, AND TO RESPECT THE HEROES 
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
 
THEY DO A GREAT JOB.  
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT 
POLITICS OF HATRED AND ANGER 
AND DIVISION. 
AND TO CELEBRATE THE GREATNESS 
AND THE GLORY OF BEING AMERICAN.
 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND 
TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO YOU, 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND, THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.  
IT WAS ALMOST 2 YEARS AGO. 
THIS GREAT STATE WAS SETTLED BY 
TOUGH PIONEER MEN, AND EVEN 
TOUGHER PIONEER WOMEN. 
 
THEY KEEP SAYING WILL HE DO 
WELL WITH WOMEN? 
REMEMBER LAST TIME, THEY SAID 
THE SAME THING? 
WE DID -- WE DID VERY WELL WITH 
WOMEN. 
I THINK I PROBABLY ONE, BECAUSE 
A WIN. 
I HATE TO TELL YOU. 
REMEMBER? 
NOW THEY ARE STARTING THE SAME 
THING. 
IT IS LIKE A REPLAY, WILL HE DO 
WELL? 
WOMEN, BY THE WAY -- WHAT DO 
THEY WANT? 
THEY WANT SECURITY. 
BOTH REAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC 
SECURITY. 
THEY DO NOT WANT TO HAVE 
CRIMINALS ALL OVER THE PLACE, 
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A 
GREAT FAMILY AND RAISE A GREAT 
FAMILY. 
THE ONE GREAT EDUCATION FOR 
THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR KIDS. 
I'M THE ONE THAT GIVES YOU 
THAT. 
THEY DO NOT -- DID NOT GIVE IT 
TO YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
FOLKS. 
AND, WE ARE GIVING YOU ALREADY
BETTER CHOICES FOR HEALTHCARE. 
I GOT RID OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE, WHICH IS THE WORST 
THING IN OBAMACARE. 
AND, WE ARE RUNNING THE 
REMNANTS OF OBAMACARE BEFORE IT 
EXPIRES COMPLETELY, AND YOU 
NOTICE, YOUR PREMIUMS ARE GOING 
UP LESS THAN THEY HAVE EVER 
GONE UP? 
BECAUSE, WE ARE DOING A REAL 
JOB. 
WE HAVE THE VOTES TO REPEAL AND 
REPLACE, AND SOMEBODY 
DISAPPOINTED US A LITTLE BIT. 
BUT, WE WILL GET ANOTHER SHOT. 
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, AS MATT 
SETTLEÃHE WILL GET US A 
COUPLE OF FLOATS. 
BUT, THESE ARE PIONEER WOMEN 
WHO BRAVED THE WILDERNESS AND 
DEFY THE DANGERS TO BUILD A 
LIFE AND A HOME, AND A FAMILY. 
THESE ARE GREAT WOMEN. 
THE MINERAL KELSO. 
THEY'RE NOT GOOD, BUT THEY ARE 
OKAY. 
 
THE MANNER OKAY. 
WHY NOT? 
THE WOMEN ARE EXCEPTIONAL. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DO NOT HAVE A LIFE OF 
LUXURY. 
BUT, THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON, THEY LOVE THEIR 
FAMILIES, THEY LOVE THEIR 
COUNTRY, AND THEY LOVED THEIR 
GOD. 
 
THESE COURAGEOUS MONTANA 
PATRIOTS DID NOT SHED THEIR 
BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS SO THAT 
WE COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE 
OTHERS TRY TO ERASE THEIR 
LEGACY INDUSTRY OUR PROUD, 
PROUD, PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE. 
 
DIDN'T DO IT. 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM, 
AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR 
CHILDREN, WE ARE GOING TO WORK, 
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT, AND WE 
ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN.  
REMEMBER, TOLD -- 
 
I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU THAT 
FOR A LONG TIME. 
WE ARE WINNING AGAIN. 
OUR COUNTRY IS RESPECTED AGAIN. 
I CAN TELL YOU -- I NEED THE 
LEADERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, 
THEY SAY -- MR. PRESIDENT -- 
CONGRATULATIONS, DID YOU KNOW 
THAT WE HAVE THE HOTTEST 
ECONOMY, IS BECAUSE WE ARE? 
WE WERE GOING DOWN. 
WE HAVE THE LARGEST ECONOMY ON 
EARTH, AND PEOPLE ARE MOVING 
BACK IN. 
WE ARE WINNING AGAIN, WE ARE 
EXPECTEDÃWE ARE RESPECTED 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL NOT END OR BREAK. 
AND WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN, WILL 
NEVER SURRENDER, AND WE WILL 
ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO VICTORY. 
 
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICAN IN OUR 
HEARTS, OUR HEARTS BLEED RED, 
WHITE, AND BLUE. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE. 
WE ARE ONE FAMILY. 
AND WE ARE ONE GLORIOUS NATION 
UNDER GOD. 
 
AND TOGETHER -- WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU, MONTANA. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
 
  
I SAW HER TODAY AT THE 
RECEPTION A GLASS OF WINE IN 
HER HAND I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA 
MEET HER CONNECTION AT HER FEET 
WAS HER FOOTLOOSE MAN  
>> WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT 
TRUMP CAMPAIGNING FOR 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN 
MONTANA AT ONE OF HIS MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN RALLIES. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS STUMPING FOR 
MATT ROSENDALE AND INCUMBENT  
GREG GIANFORTE. 
HE WAS ALSO EAGER TO RUN 
THROUGH A LITANY  OF MANY OF 
HIS GREATEST HITS AS USUAL. 
IMMIGRATION WAS AN ADDED 
URGENCY BECAUSE OF THE CARAVAN 
MAKING ITS WAY UP FROM CENTRAL 
AMERICA THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS BEEN COMPLAINING BITTERLY 
ABOUT. 
HE ALSO CELEBRATED THE 
APPOINTMENT OF  BRETT KAVANAUGH 
TO THE SUPREME COURT, AND SAID 
HE WOULD DO MORE OF THE SAME. 
HE TOUTED HIS TAX CUTS, THE 
ECONOMY, AND TIED IT UP IN A 
MOTIVATIONAL PACKAGE TO GET 
REPUBLICANS TO THE POLLS FOR 
MIDTERMS. 
HE ALSO MENTIONED INTERESTINGLY 
-- THE EPISODE LAST YEAR WHEN 
NEWLY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE 
GREG GIANFORTE  BODY SLAMMED A 
REPORTER. 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO IMPLY 
IT WAS PROBABLY OKAY, SINCE THE 
VOTERS OF MONTANA ELECTED HIM. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK, AND WHEN WE COME BACK, 
WE WILL DISCUSS PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S RALLY A LITTLE BIT 
MORE. 
YOU ARE WATCHING CBSN.
