1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,180
if these pets could talk there would be
scary stories to tell about the flooding

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,370
caused by Harvey because these dogs and
cats were left behind as floodwaters

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,139
inundated neighborhoods in and around
Dickinson Texas owners either unable to

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,170
take them or assuming the flooding
wouldn't be serious

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,609
I joined Chris Schindler and rowdy Shaw
from the Humane Society of the United

6
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,619
States after they received phone calls
from evacuated pet owners asking for the

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,750
pets to be rescued they go to a house
where floodwaters went almost as high as

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,600
the roof
they make sure no humans have come back

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,469
and then look for one dog and one cat
left behind the lower level of the house

10
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,260
is destroyed empty pet crates are
toppled flooding still remains we see a

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,000
stuffed animal which we feared for a
split second was a deceased pet Chris

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
and rowdy thoroughly searched the house
no pets are found it's not known what

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:08,729
happened to that a short time later a
happier outcome two dogs located in the

14
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,560
backyard of a nearby home Snoopy an
eight year old poodle and a B an eight

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,670
year old English bulldog are rescued so
a woman had actually found those dogs

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,689
running loose she was able to contain
them and put them in her backyard at

than 300 other dogs and cats at the
