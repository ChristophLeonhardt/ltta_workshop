>> Sandra: NORTH KOREA LEADER
KIM JONG-UN REPORTEDLY ASKING
THE POPE TO VISIT HIS COUNTRY.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO SOUTH KOREA.
THE INVITATION ANNOUNCED ON THE
HEELS OF A VISIT TO PYONGYANG
BY SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE
POMPEO SUNDAY.
HE SAYS THE SECOND SUMMIT WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM IS
CLOSE TO A DONE DEAL.
SENATOR CORY GARDNER IS THE
MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS
COMMITTEE AND JOINS US NOW.
FIRST OF ALL, THE POPE TO NORTH
KOREA?
IS THAT A LIKELY SCENARIO?
>> I CERTAINLY THINK THE POPE
WILL CONSIDER THIS VERY
CAREFULLY BEFORE HE MAKES ANY
DECISION TO DO THIS.
CLEARLY KIM JONG-UN HAS A LOT
TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS.
THE ASSASSINATION OF HIS
STEPBROTHER, THE BLOWING AWAY
OF HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW I BELIEVE
IT WAS WITH AN ANTI-AIRCRAFT
GUN BASICALLY IMPRISONMENT OF
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN NORTH
KOREA, STARVING HIS OWN PEOPLE
FOR HIS OWN ENRICHMENT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THIS
GUY HAS DONE THAT PERHAPS A
CONVERSATION WITH THE POPE
WOULD BE A LITTLE REDEEMING.
>> Sandra: WE'RE FINDING THIS
OUT THROUGH A STATEMENT FROM
SOUTH KOREA.
NORTH KOREA, YOU KNOW, PUTTING
THIS MESSAGE THROUGH THE SOUTH
AND CHAIRMAN KIM APPARENTLY
TOLD SOUTH KOREA'S MOON THE
POPE WOULD BE ENTHUSIASTICALLY
WELCOMED IN NORTH KOREA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
MOTIVATION IS THERE?
>> IT'S KIM JONG-UN TRYING TO
FLATTER THE WORLD, SHOW THE
WORLD HE CAN BRING IN BIG
NAMES, BIG PEOPLE.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, THE SECRETARY OF STATE
AND THE POPE FOR PETE SAKE
TRYING TO SHOW THEY'RE A
RATIONAL ACTOR.
BUT THEY ARE NOT AND WILL NOT
BE CONSIDERED A RATIONAL ACTOR
UNTIL THEY DENUCLEARIZE.
THERE IS NO LEGITIMIZATION THAT
WILL OCCUR OF NORTH KOREA.
FOLLOW THE LAW, INTERNATIONAL
LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW AND
MAYBE THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE
VISITS THEY WANT.
>> Sandra: ALL THIS COMING ON
THE HEELS OF WHAT MIKE POMPEO
IS DESCRIBING AS A VERY
PRODUCTIVE MEETING WITH NORTH
KOREA, WATCH.
>> WE HAD A GOOD, PRODUCTIVE
CONVERSATION.
>> Sandra: WE HAD A GOOD,
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION, HE
DESCRIBED THIS AS SIGNIFICANT
PROGRESS WHAT WE'RE SEEING TO
DATE IN A LONG PROCESS.
SO SENATOR, HOW WOULD YOU
CHARACTERIZE THE PROGRESS THAT
WE'RE MAKING WITH NORTH KOREA
TODAY?
>> THERE WAS SOME SENSE EARLY
ON WE WOULD HAVE A SUCCEED
FAST/FAIL FAST STRATEGY.
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW
IS THE RECOGNITION IT WILL BE A
LONG HAUL.
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, WE
CANNOT LET UP OUR PRESSURE.
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS
ON MAXIMUM PRESSURE, CONTINUE
OUR SANCTIONS AND CONTINUE TO
PUNISH THOSE VIOLATING THE
SANCTIONS AS IT RELATES TO
NORTH KOREA, CHINA, RUSSIA, OR
INDIVIDUAL ACTORS IN NORTH
KOREA OR AROUND THE GLOBE.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE A
VERY GOOD JOB OPENING THE
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION THAT
PREVIOUSLY WERE SHUT DOWN BUT I
WANT TO MAKE SURE IT ISN'T MORE
OF THE SAME.
WE AREN'T GOING BACK OVER 40
YEARS OF RERUNS HERE SO WE CAN
GET EVERYBODY EXCITED AND
ENTHUSED ABOUT WHAT NORTH KOREA
TO DO TO THEN PULL THE RUG OUT
UNDERNEATH AND RESULT IN NO
DENUCLEARIZATION.
>> Sandra: THE "WALL STREET
JOURNAL" BOARD WHO HAS BEEN
CRITICAL THROUGH THE PROCESS
AND THE CHARACTERIZATION OF
PROGRESS BEING MADE THERE BACKS
UP WHAT MIKE POMPEO SAID AFTER
THIS MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA
ON SUNDAY WRITING NORTH KOREA'S
BABY STEPS, THE BEST ARGUMENT
FOR MR. POMPEO'S OPTIMISM
AMOUNTS TO CONFIDENCE BUILDING
MAKE THE NORTH FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.
THAT IT'S BEING DONE ON THE
NORTH'S SLOW TIMETABLE AND THE
NORTH HAS THE DIPLOMATIC
ADVANTAGE.
>> I THINK THE NORTH
UNDERSTANDS VERY WELL THEY'RE
LOOKING AT A UNITED STATES
ELECTION CYCLE COMING UP IN 30
DAYS IN THE U.S., TWO YEARS FOR
THE PRESIDENT.
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT PERHAPS
THE DIPLOMATIC ENVIRONMENT
CHANGES AFTER ELECTIONS.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY WAIT FOR
THE NEXT PRESIDENT, WHETHER
IT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP OR
SOMEBODY ELSE?
I THINK THEY'RE CLEVER WHAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO.
THEY'LL TAKE A LONG TIME.
TIME WORKS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
AND BENEFIT.
ARE THEY ABLE TO BREAK OFF OUR
ALL AISLES IN THE MEANTIME?
WHAT CAN THEY DO TO DRIVE A
WEDGE BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA AND
THE UNITED STATES?
WILL THEY CONVINCE THE
PRESIDENT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA, WHICH I
THINK THE REMOVAL OF WOULD BE A
VERY BAD IDEA.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
TRYING TO DO.
THESE ARE SAVVY OPERATORS.
FOR PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST A BACKWARDS NATION, I
THINK ONE THING THEY DIDN'T
REALIZE THEY'VE BEEN VERY
CLEVER PARTICIPANTS IN THIS
DIPLOMATIC GAME FOR DECADES AND
KIM JONG-UN SEEMS TO HAVE
PICKED UP THAT CLEVERNESS FROM
HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER.
>> Sandra: OF COURSE WORD NOW
THAT KIM JONG-UN IS READY TO
INVITE INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS IN
TO INSPECT THIS NUCLEAR TEST
SITE.
THEY HAD JOURNALISTS WATCH IT
BACK IN MAY BUT EXPERTS SAYING
IT'S THE RANGE OF INSPECTION
THAT IS GOING TO COUNT HERE.
>> RIGHT.
IT IS THE RANGE, THE LOCATION
AND ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE
TO TEST THE SOIL AND GO INTO
FACILITIES BEYOND THIS?
WILL THEY HAVE A FULL
DISCLOSURE OF THE FACILITIES?
UNFETTERED ACCESS OF ALL OF
THESE FACILITIES AROUND THE
COUNTRY?
THIS ISN'T JUST A ONE SITE
LOCATION WHERE THE NUCLEAR
TESTS WERE TAKING PLACE.
THERE ARE COMPUTER MODELING,
LABORATORIES, RESEARCH BEING
DONE AT ANY NUMBER OF
FACILITIES AND A ONE-TIME,
ONE-OFF LIMITED INSPECTION
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
I'M GLAD WE ARE WHERE WE ARE
AND HAVEN'T SEEN MISSILES
FLYING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
HUNDRED DAYS.
THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT.
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACHIEVE THE
PROMISE THEY MADE IN SINGAPORE.
THAT'S DENUCLEARIZATION.
>> Sandra: IT IS BEING
CHARACTERIZED DIFFERENT WAYS
BUT A LOT HAPPENING.
MEETINGS HAPPENING AND NOW AN
