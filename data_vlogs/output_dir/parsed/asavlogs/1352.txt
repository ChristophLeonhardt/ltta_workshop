Lucy - it hi guys so it's time to wrap
up this vlog hope you guys enjoy his
blog if you did make sure you guys get
like a thumbs up and go Turkey I want
each and everything one of you guys to
give like a thumbs up I see how much
thumbs up we can get today is 9/11 is a
day that will never be forgotten
especially for me because it did change
my life it made so much racism and hate
get to me and if anyone thinks 9/11 was
done by Iraq or the Middle East or
whatever then you are lost in life it's
pretty clear that 9/11 was set up by the
government that don't want to say
anything even the cops even NYPD were
like that they heard bombs from floor to
floor in the Twin Towers it's just sad
how the whole Muslims were blamed and
hated for for something that we did not
do but me everybody who passed away 9/11
rest in peace is just so sad and knowing
that so many families had to go through
so many of these deaths just uh and now
the Middle East has to go a hundred
times even more deaths and more just
just but I guess all we could do right
now is you know keep them in our prayers
and just always be positive and yeah
I'll see you guys tomorrow with another
ACLU blogs I love you guys teammates
a-booming yang take care and peace love
