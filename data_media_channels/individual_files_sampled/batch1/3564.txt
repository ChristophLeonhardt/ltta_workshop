how about your workout schedule I know you state your waking up at 5:00 a.m. still even though you're supposed to be resting right I know I can't rest I try but my record workout regimen is pretty much five times a week of five times a week every day and it goes very sometimes I stay at home and work out sometimes I'll go to actual class I've been to like verse the climber classes or spinning classes or you know I do Pilates as well so it kind of varies depending on how I'm feeling and it's not the same for other season I would assume you do like free day workout something yeah well during the season you know we've planned basketball every single day and we're working on our bodies every day so I don't get an opportunity to do two classes as much because we're doing a lot of traveling and things of that nature but you know my workout regimen is pretty consistent as well as mostly seven days a week you know during the season because we were we will play games on the weekend as well
