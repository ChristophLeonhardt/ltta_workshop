this is not the anniversary any leader wants to have it was exactly one year ago when Donald Trump made this promise and became president we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done he vowed government would work again it's clear with this it isn't Republicans who control the Congress and the White House lost four of their own members but picked up five Democrats still not enough to pass the bill that means many non-essential government employees won't be coming to work on Monday without a deal although most essential federal services will continue the employees just won't get paid until it's over it came down to this a program that was in place to protect children brought into this country without documentation President Trump threw it out said Congress should fix it he promised to help if we do this properly doctor you're not so far away from comprehensive immigration reform and if you want to take it that further step I'll take the heat I don't care I don't care I'll take all the heat you want to give them they brought him a bipartisan deal and he refused to sign it so Democrats refused to help pass the budget now the White House is saying they still have the weekend to work out a deal for now it is a standoff a functioning government held hostage while two parties wait to see which side the public will blame for the very dysfunction that trump promised to end exactly one year ago what we've just witnessed on the floor was a cynical decision by Senate Democrats who shove aside millions of Americans for the sake of irresponsible political games a government shutdown was 100% avoidable this will be called the Trump shutdown because there is no one no one who deserves the blame for the position we find ourselves in more than president Trump patty contain al-jazeera Washington
