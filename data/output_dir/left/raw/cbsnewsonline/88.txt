1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,403
IT IS A TIGHTKNIT COMMUNITY OF 

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,672
ABOUT 1500 OR SO RESIDENTS. 

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:10,510
THAT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SORT OF 

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,578
GETTING TOGETHER TO TRY TO, 

5
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:12,912
THERE YOU SEE EXACTLY WHAT I 

6
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:13,780
WAS GOING TO REFERENCE, THAT 

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,049
THEY HAVE BEEN BANDING TOGETHER 

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,383
TO FAN OUT AND TRY TO FIND 

9
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:18,017
WHATEVER DETAILS AND 

10
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,520
INFORMATION THAT COULD. 

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,921
THERE WAS A MASSIVE SORT OF 

12
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:22,521
ORGANIZATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT 

13
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,522
WAS CENTERED AROUND GETTING 

14
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:25,525
PEOPLE TO BE AWARE OF THE FACT 

15
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,627
THAT SHE WAS MISSING. 

16
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,462
AND NOW OF COURSE, THE SAD NEWS 

17
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,999
WHICH IS THAT CBS NEWS IS 

18
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:33,967
REPORTING THAT HER BODY HAS 

19
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,367
BEEN FOUND. 

20
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,270
CLEARLY, SO MANY ANSWERS, SO 

21
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,307
MANY QUESTIONS, AND NOT SO MANY 

22
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:41,574
ANSWERS. 

23
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,542
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

24
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,377
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER 

25
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:44,877
DISAPPEARANCE WHERE. 

26
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,012
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

27
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,046
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER DEMISE 

28
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:51,051
WORK, AND ADRIANA DIAZ HAD BEEN 

29
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,218
ON THE GROUND THERE FOR QUITE 

30
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:52,551
SOME TIME. 

31
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:54,054
WE WILL SPEAK WITH HER AND JUST 

32
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:54,620
A LITTLE BIT. 

33
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,856
THAT'S AT THE SAID NEWS COMING 

34
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,424
INTO THE NEWSROOM THAT MOLLIE 

35
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,459
TIBBETTS HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD. 

36
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,528
WE ARE STILL WAITING TO GET A 

37
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:11,371
HOLD OF HER TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 

38
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,672
THIS IS GOING TO BE, FOR 

39
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,940
CERTAIN, THE FAMILY IS GOING TO 

40
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,874
BE SHOCKED AND SADDENED. 

41
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:15,742
BUT THIS ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT 

42
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,876
HAS BEEN GRIEVING ALONG WITH 

43
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:17,910
THE FAMILY OF MOLLIE TIBBETTS 

44
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:27,654
FOR THESE NEARLY 5 WEEKS. 

45
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,688
>> WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS 

46
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,522
HAPPENS, THE PEOPLE CLOSE TO 

47
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,122
HER, UNDER SUSPICION. 

48
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:31,524
THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT HER 

49
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:31,824
BOYFRIEND. 

50
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:40,633
HE WAS OUT OF TOWN STAYING AT 

51
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,001
-- SHE WAS STAYING AT HIS 

52
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,301
APARTMENT. 

53
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,102
THERE WAS SOME STORY ABOUT A 

54
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,470
FARMER NEARBY THAT REFUSED A 

55
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,374
POLYGRAPH TEST. 

56
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,409
EVENTUALLY HE SAID THAT HE 

57
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,710
WOULD. ÃºWHY POLICE HAD BEEN INI 

58
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,611
INTERESTED IN HIM, WE DON'T 

59
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,946
KNOW, IT COULD JUST BE THAT 

60
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,980
THEY WERE LOOKING AT EVERYONE 

61
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,081
WHO COULD HAVE POSSIBLY COME IN 

62
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:55,682
CONTACT WITH HER. 

63
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,950
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, THIS HAS 

64
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,717
TRANSFORMED THIS TINY TOWN OF 

65
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:02,655
BROOKLYN. AND THEY WERE 

66
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,157
PROBABLY, MOST OF THE 

67
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,060
POPULATION WERE PROBABLY 

68
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,527
MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA AT THE 

69
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:09,696
HEIGHT OF THIS SEARCH. 

70
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,433
IT HAS CONFOUNDED PEOPLE. 

71
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,971
WHEN PEOPLE GO MISSING, IT'S A 

72
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,304
LARGE CITY. 

73
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,205
THERE ARE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS 

74
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:19,505
EVERYWHERE. 

75
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:22,475
OFTEN YOU CAN CATCH GLIMPSES OF 

76
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,676
THE PERSON, BUT BECAUSE OF THE 

77
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,710
NATURE OF THIS TOWN, AND FOR 

78
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:36,422
MANY REASONS, PROBABLY BECAUSE 

79
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,423
IT IS SMALL, THEY DIDN'T HAVE 

80
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,725
THE EVIDENCE TO GIVE THEM ANY 

81
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,993
SORT OF INDICATION AS TO WHERE 

82
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,727
SHE MAY HAVE GONE. 

83
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,594
IN FACT, HER PARENTS STARTED 

84
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,629
SPECTATING THAT MAYBE SHE 

85
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,063
RETURNED FROM HER JOG AND WAS 

86
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,298
ON THE COMPTER AND IT HAD COME 

87
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:45,498
BACK. 

88
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,666
BUT THEN THE POLICE SAID WE 

89
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,900
DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF OF THAT. 

90
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,068
AND THERE IS ALMOST A RUMOR 

91
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,337
MILL AT ONE POINT AS PEOPLE 

92
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:58,745
JUST SORT OF EAGER TO FIND 

93
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,011
ANSWERS. 

94
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,680
>> WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

95
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,551
SPEAK TO A FORMER FBI PROFILER. 

96
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:06,652
WE TALKED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY 

97
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,221
THAT COULD BE USED IN 

98
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:14,593
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. RECALL 

99
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:15,962
THAT SHE WAS WEARING A FIT BIT 

100
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,397
WHEN SHE WENT ON THE JOG. 

101
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,164
SO WHEN FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS, 

102
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:18,931
THE FBI, SPECIFICALLY, GOT 

103
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,566
INVOLVED IN HER HIS APPEARANCE, 

104
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,870
THEY TRIED TO COMB THROUGH HER 

105
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,671
SOCIAL MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY 

106
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,471
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO 

107
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,472
INVESTIGATORS NOW IN 2018 THAT 

108
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,473
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE 

109
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,008
FIVE OR SIX OR 10 YEARS AGO. 

110
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:29,876
TO TRY TO PINPOINT HER 

111
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,143
LOCATION. 

112
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:36,849
THE TRY TO PINPOINT WHERE SHE 

113
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,084
MAY HAVE BEEN AND WHAT 

114
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:38,351
HAPPENED. 

115
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:38,985
CLEARLY, THAT INVESTIGATION WAS 

116
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:39,886
STILL ONGOING WHEN WE LEARNED 

117
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,954
OF THE NEWS HERE THAT SHE HAD 

118
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:45,258
BEEN FOUND DEAD. 

119
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,726
THERE IS A LOT THAT WE DON'T 

120
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,429
KNOW THAT INVESTIGATORS KNOW. 

121
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,296
WE ARE STILL TRYING TO 

122
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,598
UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE WAS FOUND. 

123
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,832
WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION 

124
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,800
YET. 

125
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,436
SO ALL WE DO KNOW, ALL THAT HAS 

126
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,637
BEEN REPORTED RIGHT NOW IS THAT 

127
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,206
SHE HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD. 

128
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,674
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

129
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,809
AND I'M SURE THE FAMILY DOES AS 

130
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,209
WELL. 

131
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,178
WE KNOW THAT THE FBI HAD BEEN 

132
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,979
INVOLVED IN HELPING LOCAL LAW 

133
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,848
ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO LOCATE 

134
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,949
HER. 

135
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,786
>> WE WANT TO BRING IN OUR GO 

136
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,356
TO MEN WHEN IT COMES TO THESE 

137
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:16,656
SITUATIONS. 

138
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,826
CAN YOU HEAR US? 

139
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,527
>> Reporter: HELLO. 

140
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:26,099
I CAN. 

141
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,467
>> SO GLAD YOU ARE JOINING US. 

142
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,935
I KNOW THAT THIS IS A SITUATION 

143
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,902
WHERE THERE ARE CERTAINLY, NOT 

144
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:35,008
TO USE A CLICHC MORE QUESTIONS 

145
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,342
THAN ANSWERS, BUT THIS IS BEEN 

146
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:36,843
QUITE A MYSTERY. 

147
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,043
IT SEEMED LIKE SHE DISAPPEARED 

148
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:38,578
WITHOUT A TRACE. 

149
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:42,548
BUT AT THIS POINT, WE ARE 

150
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,518
LEARNING THAT A BODY HAS BEEN 

151
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:45,952
FOUND. 

152
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,186
WHERE DOES THE INVESTIGATION GO 

153
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:47,486
FROM HERE? 

154
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,522
I IMAGINE FINDING A BODY AS 

155
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,590
DISAPPOINTING AND HEARTBREAKING 

156
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,229
AS IT IS, IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD

157
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,497
TO FINDING THIS DOSE SOLVING 

158
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:57,864
THIS MYSTERY. 

159
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,898
>> IT VERY WELL COULD BE. 

160
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,100
FIRST, THEY ARE GOING TO 

161
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,402
EXAMINE THIS BODY FORENSICALLY 

162
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:08,207
TO TRY TO ESTABLISH A TIME OR 

163
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,042
DATE OF DEATH. 

164
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,543
THE MECHANISM, THE MEANS OF THE 

165
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:15,982
DEATH, THEY ARE GOING TO COMB 

166
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,617
OVER THE BODY IN GREAT DETAIL 

167
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,020
FOR SIGNS THAT INDICATED, SIGNS 

168
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,755
INDICATIVE OF A STRUGGLE FOR DNA

169
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:28,795
OF A POTENTIAL OFFENDER. 

170
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,129
ANY MINUTIA THAT MIGHT GIVE 

171
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,100
THEM A CLUE AS TO WHERE SHE HAS 

172
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,368
BEEN, HOW LONG SHE HAS BEEN 

173
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,805
THERE AND ANYONE WHO LINKS -- 

174
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,607
LINKS TO ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE HAD

175
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,275
A HAND IN HER DEATH. 

176
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,511
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH KIDNAPPINGS 

177
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,482
OF THIS NATURE, THE MORE TIME 

178
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,486
GOES BY, THE LESS LIKELY THAT 

179
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,121
YOU WILL HAVE A POSITIVE 

180
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,989
OUTCOME. 

181
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,458
AND HERE, THIS YOUNG LADY HAS 

182
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,392
BEEN MISSING FOR WEEKS. 

183
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,762
WE HAD SOME, I GUESS MAYBE 

184
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,630
HINTS FROM THE FATHER, THE 

185
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,432
BELIEF THAT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE 

186
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,235
AND WITH SOMEONE, PERHAPS 

187
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,236
SOMEONE SHE KNEW. 

188
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,672
THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS A 

189
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,406
RELATIONSHIP OF SOME SORT. 

190
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,973
A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT. 

191
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:19,245
BUT NOW WE COME TO THIS VERY 

192
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:23,983
TRAGIC AND -- END. AND WE HOPE 

193
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,919
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN PUT THE 

194
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,087
PIECES TOGETHER AND FIND OUT 

195
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:28,520
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. 

196
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:36,095
>> FOR THE -- FOR THOSE OF US 

197
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,062
THAT LIVE IN BIG METROPOLITAN 

198
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:37,997
CITIES, IT IS SOMETIMES 

199
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:38,831
DIFFICULT FOR THOSE TO 

200
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,099
UNDERSTAND THAT IN A CITY OF 

201
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,537
NINE OR 10 MILLION PEOPLE WHERE 

202
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,605
IT FEELS LIKE PEOPLE CAN 

203
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,739
DISAPPEAR EASILY, A LOT OF 

204
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,439
PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND 

205
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,674
HOW SOMEBODY IN A SMALL 

206
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,575
COMMUNITY, APPARENTLY THERE ARE 

207
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,177
ONLY ABOUT 1500 RESIDENTS OF 

208
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,480
THIS SMALL IOWA TOWN, COULD GO 

209
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,417
MISSING. 

210
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:06,058
AS AN FBI INVESTIGATOR, DOES 

211
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,326
THAT TELL YOU THAT THEY MAY 

212
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,694
HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THIS 

213
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,529
COMMUNITY, OR COULD THEY JUST 

214
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,063
SORT OF BE IN PLAIN SIGHT, I 

215
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,231
DON'T MEAN IN PLAIN SIGHT, BUT 

216
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,299
IN THE SURROUNDING AREA, AND 

217
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,834
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS 

218
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,901
MUCH SMALLER, IT IS EASIER TO 

219
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,069
HIDE OR TO KIDNAP SOMEBODY AND 

220
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:17,803
KEEP THEM HIDDEN. 

221
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,438
>> WE HAVE SEEN EXAMPLES ACROSS 

222
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,339
THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 

223
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,108
BEEN KIDNAPPED OFF THE STREETS. 

224
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,210
AND THERE ARE WITNESSES, THAT 

225
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,347
THE UNBLINKING EYE OF A 

226
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,449
SECURITY CAMERA DOWN THE BLOCK, 

227
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:37,256
I'M TAKING BACK TO ONE A FEW 

228
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,291
YEARS AGO IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE 

229
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,392
A YOUNG LADY WAS KIDNAPPED OFF 

230
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,793
THE STREET AND THERE WAS A 

231
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,427
VIDEO DOWN THE STREET. 

232
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,628
AND FORTUNATELY, SHE WAS FOUND 

233
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:51,671
ALIVE WITH THE OFFENDER. 

234
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,972
I THINK IT WAS DOWN IN 

235
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,239
DELAWARE. 

236
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,373
AND SO YOU HAVE IN THAT URBAN 

237
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,107
ENVIRONMENT, A GREATER 

238
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:55,841
OPPORTUNITY, I THINK, FOR 

239
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:56,842
CAMERAS AND WITNESSES, FOR 

240
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:57,476
NEIGHBORS, FROM SOMEBODY JUST 

241
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,179
PASSING ON THE STREET TO SAY, I 

242
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:00,847
HAVE A DESCRIPTION. 

243
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,217
AND BY THE WAY, THEN THE POLICE 

244
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,184
CAN TRACK IT BACK POTENTIALLY 

245
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,620
TO A CAR OR A TICKET THAT WAS 

246
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:07,987
ISSUED NEARBY. 

247
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,622
IN THIS RURAL ENVIRONMENT, 

248
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,926
THERE IS A DIFFERENT SET OF 

249
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,226
CHALLENGES. 

250
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:14,760
TYPICALLY SPEAKING, THOSE 

251
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,996
CAMERAS ARE NOT IN PLACE. 

252
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:21,334
IT MAY BE RELATIVELY REMOTE. 

253
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,069
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH IF SHE WERE 

254
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,140
JOGGING NEAR AN IOWA CORNFIELD, 

255
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,412
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO 

256
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,246
DRIVE BY, POTENTIALLY BUMPER 

257
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,881
WITH A CAR, HIT HER AND INJURE 

258
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,515
HER IN SOME WAY AND PUT HER IN 

259
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,620
THE CAR AND TAKE HER AWAY, 

260
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,554
WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING, WITHOUT 

261
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,020
ANYBODY HEARING, IT IS FRANKLY 

262
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,361
GREATER JUST BECAUSE OF THE 

263
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,161
LACK OF POPULATION DENSITY. 

264
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,731
THE LACK OF FOLKS NEARBY IN A 

265
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,632
WIDE-OPEN TERRITORY. 

266
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,835
SO IT PRESENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT 

267
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,003
WITH ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES. 

268
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,640
I AM SURE, THERE HAVE BEEN 

269
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,642
REPORTS OF THE FBI DEVOTING A 

270
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,710
COUPLE DOZEN AGENTS TO THIS. 

271
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,511
I'M SURE THEY HAVE. 

272
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,746
AND I'M SURE THEY HAVE GONE 

273
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,548
THROUGH ALL OF THE EXPECTED, 

274
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:12,752
KIND OF A CHECKLIST OF 

275
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:21,060
PROCEDURES LOOKING FOR WHO ARE 

276
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,061
THE SEXUAL PREDATORS WHO ARE 

277
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:22,962
REGISTERED IN THE AREA. 

278
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,096
WHO ELSE IS IN THE AREA? 

279
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,298
WHO HAS SHOWN AN INTEREST IN 

280
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:25,831
THE YOUNG LADY? 

281
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,934
WHO HAS SHE BEEN COMMUNICATING 

282
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:28,501
WITH? 

283
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,902
COULD IT HAVE BEEN SOME WOULD 

284
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,969
BE PARAMORE FROM HER PAST THAT 

285
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,104
POPPED BACK UP THAT HAS BEEN 

286
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,005
QUIETLY WATCHING THAT INTENDED 

287
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,006
HER HARM BECAUSE SHE REBUFFED 

288
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:34,840
HIM? 

289
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,043
ANY OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, ANY 

290
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:45,317
OF THOSE POSSIBILITIES WILL BE 

291
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:46,017
LOOKED AT VIGOROUSLY BY LAW-

292
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:46,351
ENFORCEMENT. 

293
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,586
>> ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT GOT 

294
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:48,554
ATTENTION WAS THIS FARM THAT 

295
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,822
LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN, 

296
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,090
SEVERAL MILES, I DON'T KNOW HOW 

297
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,191
THE MEDIA GOT WIND OF HIM, BUT 

298
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,928
WE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN 

299
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,729
QUESTIONED REPEATEDLY BY THE 

300
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,130
FBI WHICH CERTAINLY MADE HIM AN 

301
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,630
INTERESTING CHARACTER. 

302
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,433
AND THEN HE WAS PRETTY GUARDED 

303
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,067
ON TELEVISION, FIRST REFUSING 

304
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,704
TO DO A POLYGRAPH AND LATER ON, 

305
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,705
HE ADMITTED ON TELEVISION 

306
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:06,872
STATIONS THAT HE ACTUALLY DID 

307
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:07,740
DO THE POLYGRAPH TEST. 

308
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,846
I GUESS I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. 

309
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,014
IF THE POLYGRAPH TESTS AREN'T 

310
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:15,981
ADMISSIBLE IN COURT, WHY WOULD 

311
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:19,418
THE FBI FIND THEM VALUABLE? 

312
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,753
>> I HAVE USED THAT TECHNIQUE 

313
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,622
IN MY CASES IN THE PAST, AND IN 

314
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,460
THE HANDS OF COMPETENT, CAPABLE 

315
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,395
POLYGRAPHER, YOU COULD COAX A 

316
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:35,067
CONFESSION. YOU COULD GET TIPS 

317
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,469
AND CLUES AND YOU COULD GET A 

318
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,503
CULPRIT LEVEL THAT WE ARE 

319
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,404
INTERVIEWING THE WRONG PERSON, 

320
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,705
OR YOU CAN GET SIGNS THAT TELL 

321
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,107
YOU THAT DESPITE DENIALS, THAT 

322
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,378
YOU ARE LOOKING AT EXACTLY THE 

323
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,912
RIGHT PERSON. 

324
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,913
I THINK LAW-ENFORCEMENT DOES IT 

325
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,382
VIEW IT AS A TOOL IN THE 

326
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,482
TOOLBOX, NOT NECESSARILY 

327
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,018
POSITIVE, BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN 

328
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:56,489
BE. 

329
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,190
IT CAN LEAD TO A CONFESSION. 

330
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,793
>> SHOULD AN INNOCENT PERSON 

331
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:05,398
AVOID DOING A POLYGRAPH TEST? 

332
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,602
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK SO. 

333
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,103
I THINK IN THE HANDS OF A 

334
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,238
COMPETENT EXAMINER, I HAVE BEEN 

335
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,472
POLYGRAPH IN MY OWN CAREER FOR 

336
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,172
SECURITY PURPOSES. 

337
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,674
AND YOUR APPREHENSION LEVEL, 

338
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,077
YOUR ANXIETY LEVEL DOES RATCHET 

339
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,179
UP AS YOU ARE PUTTING WIRES 

340
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,348
ACROSS YOU AND HOOKING YOU INTO 

341
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,284
THIS DEVICE TO PROBE WHETHER 

342
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,387
YOU ARE BEING TRUTHFUL. 

343
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,855
AND SO, A COMPETENT, CAPABLE 

344
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:35,795
POLYGRAPH EXAMINER UNDERSTANDS 

345
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,196
THOSE SIGNS, UNDERSTANDS IN THE 

346
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,430
PRETEST PROCEDURES HOW TO 

347
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,101
ACCOUNT FOR THOSE SIGNS THAT ARE

348
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,335
PURELY ANXIETY BECAUSE OF THE 

349
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,204
TEST WHICH IS COMMON, AND THAT 

350
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,539
WHICH LOOKS LIKE DECEPTION. 

351
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:53,078
AND SO I THINK IT IS A VERY 

352
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:53,712
VALUABLE TOOL FOR LAW 

353
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,512
ENFORCEMENT, BUT YOU CANNOT 

354
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:55,448
RELY ON IT SOLELY. 

355
00:11:55,448 --> 00:12:00,052
IT IS NOT ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. 

356
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,053
HOWEVER IT CAN PROVIDE USEFUL 

357
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,321
CLUES TO SAY, WE ARE ON THE 

358
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,957
RIGHT PERSON, LET'S PUT ROUND-

359
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:05,791
THE-CLOCK SURVEILLANCE ON THIS 

360
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,024
PERSON. 

361
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,059
THEY ARE FAILING THE TEST. 

362
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,227
WE HAVE TO NARROW OUR FOCUS. 

363
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,162
WE HAVE TO GET ADDITIONAL 

364
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,163
INFORMATION THAT MAY GIVE US 

365
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,965
PROBABLE CAUSE FOR A SEARCH OF 

366
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,033
THE PROPERTY. 

367
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:21,507
TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL 

368
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,174
INVESTIGATIONS SURROUNDING ONE 

369
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:22,508
PERSON. 

370
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,342
OR TO POTENTIALLY SAY, LOOK, 

371
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,543
THIS IS THE WRONG PERSON. 

372
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,811
LET'S CROSS THEM OFF THE LIST 

373
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,712
AND CONCENTRATE EFFORTS 

374
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:32,885
SOMEWHERE ELSE. 

375
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,187
>> IN CASES SUCH AS THIS, IS IT 

376
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,388
TYPICALLY CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, 

377
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,156
AND THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM 

378
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:43,195
THAT IS PROVEN BY INVESTIGATIONS

379
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,296
THAT THE FBI HAS CONDUCTED, 

380
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,397
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE KIDNAPPED 

381
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,198
ARE GENERALLY KIDNAPPED BY 

382
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,366
SOMEONE THAT THEY KNOW OR 

383
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,234
SOMEONE THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED 

384
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:48,634
TO SOMEHOW? 

385
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,169
THAT THESE THINGS ARE NOT 

386
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,372
GENERALLY RANDOM, OR AM I 

387
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:53,772
WRONG? 

388
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,376
>> REALLY, THE VERY SMALL 

389
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,811
MINORITY OF ACTUAL STRANGER 

390
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,014
ABDUCTIONS IN THE COUNTRY, THAT 

391
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:06,452
IS THE SMALL MINORITY. 

392
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,653
THEN YOU EXPAND OUT FROM THAT, 

393
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,054
AND YOU LOOK AT THE KIDNAPPINGS 

394
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:14,760
THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY A PARENT, 

395
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,761
BECAUSE THERE IS A DIVORCE 

396
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,396
PENDING, THERE IS A SEPARATION 

397
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,765
PENDING, AND SO YOU HAVE A 

398
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,166
PARENT TAKING THE CHILD WITHOUT 

399
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,368
THE COURT'S AUTHORITY. 

400
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,402
SOMETIMES THE FOREIGN 

401
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:23,702
COUNTRIES. 

402
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:31,377
YOU HAVE FAMILIARITY WITH 

403
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,412
PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIAL 

404
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,681
OFFENDERS. THAT MAY BE A 

405
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,516
NEIGHBOR OR SOMEONE IN LINE OF 

406
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,885
SIGHT, SEXUAL PREDATOR WITH 

407
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,920
PRIOR CONTACT. 

408
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,058
BUT A -- THE TRUE STRANGER 

409
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,493
ABDUCTIONS, I THINK ARE VERY 

410
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,728
MUCH IN THE MINORITY AND REALLY 

411
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:56,201
ONLY A COUPLE DOZEN PER YEAR. 

412
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,636
>> SO FROM GOING FROM THAT 

413
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:03,709
BASIS, OUR PEOPLE WHO, YOU KNOW,

414
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,310
I AM TRYING TO THINK OF, I 

415
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,012
GUESS IF YOU KIDNAPPED SOMEONE, 

416
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:19,391
THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T, 

417
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,326
THEY'RE NOT A REPEAT OFFENDER, 

418
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,227
ONCE YOU KIDNAPPED SOMEONE, IF 

419
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,761
THEY CATCH YOU, YOU GO TO JAIL 

420
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,429
FOR A LONG TIME. 

421
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,630
BUT I'M WONDERING, I'M TRYING 

422
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,931
TO UNDERSTAND HOW IN A SMALL 

423
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,865
COMMUNITY, SOMEONE COULD ALL OF 

424
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,866
A SUDDEN DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING 

425
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,301
IF WE ASSUME THAT PERHAPS SHE 

426
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,869
WAS CONNECTED TO WHOEVER THE 

427
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,236
KIDNAPPER WAS. 

428
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:34,139
>> YOU DON'T JUST START WITH 

429
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:34,773
KIDNAPPING, THERE MUST'VE BEEN 

430
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,206
SOMETHING ELSE? 

431
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:36,742
>> AS ALWAYS, SHE GETS WHAT I'M 

432
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:37,243
TRYING TO SAY. 

433
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,043
[ LAUGHTER ] 

434
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,879
>> I THINK THERE IS SOME TRUTH 

435
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,980
TO THAT, USUALLY THERE IS 

436
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,680
ANOTHER STARTING POINT. 

437
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,948
THAT IS WHY THE FBI, LAW 

438
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,083
ENFORCEMENT OUT THERE ARE GOING 

439
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,419
TO BE LOOKING AT PRIOR 

440
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,422
REGISTERED SEXUAL OFFENDERS. 

441
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,425
SOMEONE WHO HAS A KIDNAPPING, 

442
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,693
FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES, IN THE 

443
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:59,364
PAST, CONVICTED FELONS, 

444
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,499
RELEASED IN THAT AREA, LIVING 

445
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,433
IN THE GENERAL AREA, PASSING 

446
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,334
THROUGH THE AREA. 

447
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,402
BUT YOU ARE GENERALLY LOOKING 

448
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,937
FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS THIS KIND 

449
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,874
OF DNA. THEY HAVE SHARED A 

450
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,409
PROPENSITY TO DO BAD THINGS IN 

451
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,980
THE PAST. 

452
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,015
THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD THEY WILL 

453
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:16,615
DO IT AGAIN. 

454
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,050
BUT I THINK THERE IS ALSO THE 

455
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,851
OPPORTUNITY THAT LAW 

456
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,685
ENFORCEMENT CANNOT IGNORE THAT 

457
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,219
THIS IS A ONE-OFF OFFENDER, 

458
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,555
SOMEONE WHO HAS SHOWN AN 

459
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,659
INTEREST IN HER, ALTHOUGH 

460
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,494
PERHAPS CONCEALED, AND INTEREST 

461
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,396
IN HER IN THE PAST. 

462
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,898
OR AN INTEREST IN YOUNG LADIES 

463
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,132
THAT FIT A SIMILAR DESCRIPTION. 

464
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:39,738
AND THEY ARE SITTING OUT THERE 

465
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,773
BECAUSE SO MUCH BAD IS 

466
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,640
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET NOW. 

467
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,975
YOU CAN SEARCH AND SEE ANY 

468
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,677
HORRIBLE THING YOU WANT TO 

469
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,444
SEARCH AND SEE. 

470
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,081
AND I THINK THAT IS, IT GIVES 

471
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:53,652
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE WHO 

472
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,287
IS A NOVICE, WHO IS NEW TO THIS 

473
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,989
SORT OF THING, IT GIVES THEM 

474
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:02,861
POTENTIAL INSPIRATION, THAT 

475
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,129
THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING AT IT ON 

476
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,197
THE INTERNET, AND SUDDENLY, 

477
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,365
THEY DECIDE, HEY, I'M GOING TO 

478
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:06,865
DO THIS. 

479
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:07,866
I'M GOING TO ACT ON MY 

480
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:08,132
IMPULSE. 

481
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,401
I AM TIRED OF SEEING IT. 

482
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,804
I AM GOING TO LIVE IT. 

483
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,272
AND SO, THAT IS THE JOB OF LAW 

484
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,807
ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO FIGURE 

485
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,677
OUT, OKAY, FIRST, WHAT IS THE 

486
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,178
VICTIM BALAJI? 

487
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,513
WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT MOLLIE 

488
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:27,186
TIBBETTS'S HABITS? WHO SHE 

489
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,387
ASSOCIATES WITH, WHO IS IN THE 

490
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,588
SOCIAL CIRCLE AND WHO TRIED TO 

491
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:34,893
GET TO BE PART OF A SOCIAL 

492
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:35,828
CIRCLE WITH HER, ANYONE 

493
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,962
REBUFFED, TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE 

494
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,497
VICTIM AND THEN WORK TOWARD WHO 

495
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,331
IS A POTENTIAL OFFENDER, BASED 

496
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,935
ON HER PATTERN OF LIFE, WHO 

497
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,770
WOULD BE INTERSECTING THE 

498
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,003
PERSON? 

499
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,171
INTERSECTING WITH HER, LOOKING 

500
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,308
TO POTENTIALLY DO HER HARM? 

501
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,578
AND IF SO, I AM SURE THAT THE 

502
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,046
FBI AND THE BEHAVIORAL LIST IN 

503
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:58,183
QUANTICO, THEY ARE PITCHING IN. 

504
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,384
THEY ARE LOOKING OVER THE 

505
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:00,018
INFORMATION AND TRYING TO 

506
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,319
DEVELOP A POTENTIAL OFFENDER 

507
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,055
PROFILE IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A 

508
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,791
LOGICAL SUSPECT ALREADY IN MIND.

509
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,094
>> I AM LOOKING AT THIS VIDEO 

510
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:15,134
OF THE SEARCH, AND THESE ARE 

511
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:15,701
LONG COUNTRY ROADS. 

512
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,602
THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS. 

513
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,869
AND IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT 

514
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,105
PERHAPS AN ACCIDENT IS A 

515
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:20,438
POSSIBILITY. 

516
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:25,044
IF SHE WAS OUT AND RUNNING, SHE 

517
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,744
COULD'VE BEEN HIT BY A CAR. 

518
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,213
IS THAT SOMETHING TO 

519
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,515
CONTEMPLATE? 

520
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:35,954
>> I THINK IN THE EARLY DAYS, 

521
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,022
THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE A 

522
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:37,890
POSSIBILITY, BECAUSE COULD BE 

523
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,857
THAT THIS WAS A DISTRACTED 

524
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:39,124
DRIVER? 

525
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,325
HEY BUMPED HER ON A COU 

526
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,726
ROAD BECAUSE THEY WERE TEXTING 

527
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,295
OR DISTRACTED AND THEY BUMPED 

528
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,564
HER AND SHE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT, 

529
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:51,637
AND THEY FLED THE SCENE 

530
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,771
THINKING, WHAT DID I JUST DO, 

531
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,472
HIDDEN RUNS ARE COMMON. 

532
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,376
THEY OCCUR IN EVERY CITY OF OUR 

533
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,877
COUNTRY PROBABLY ON A DAILY 

534
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,110
BASIS. 

535
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,879
SO COULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT SORT 

536
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,147
OF INCIDENT? 

537
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,181
AND SHE JUST WASN'T DISCOVERED 

538
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:03,715
IN TIME? 

539
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,350
WE WILL FIND THAT OUT. 

540
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,820
WAS THIS AN INJURY FROM BEING 

541
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,490
STRUCK BY A VEHICLE AND SHE WAS 

542
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,024
LEFT IN A SERIOUSLY INJURED 

543
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:15,861
CONDITION AND DIED OF EXPOSURE? 

544
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,965
WHAT IS THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? 

545
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,866
DOES IT TAKE US TO THAT SORT OF 

546
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:22,734
CONCLUSION? 

547
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,503
HOW CLOSE TO A ROADWAY WAS SHE 

548
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,906
FOUND? WAS SHE PUT IN SOME MORE 

549
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:28,707
REMOTE PLACE? 

550
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,776
I AM THINKING BACK TO A DEATH 

551
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,977
DOWN HERE IN THE 

552
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,212
CHARLOTTESVILLE AREA. 

553
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,980
AGAIN, A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE 

554
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,414
FBI. 

555
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,582
UNFORTUNATELY, LAW ENFORCEMENT 

556
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,319
LOCATED THE VICTIM BECAUSE OF 

557
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,390
VULTURES FLYING IN A PARTICULAR 

558
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,991
AREA. 

559
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,292
THE SMELL OF A DECAYING BODY, 

560
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,093
AND THAT HELPED LAW ENFORCEMENT 

561
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:52,431
LOCATE THE VICTIM. 

562
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,800
IT IS TRAGIC AND UNFORTUNATE. 

563
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,901
IN THAT CASE, IT WAS A 

564
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:56,167
HOMICIDE. 

565
00:18:56,167 --> 00:19:00,272
IT WAS AN INTENDED ACT. 

566
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,073
LAW-ENFORCEMENT BY THE HUNDREDS 

567
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,176
WERE SEARCHING WITH THE 

568
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:04,710
COMMUNITY. 

569
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,514
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A TRAGIC END.

570
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:16,922
>> WE ARE JUST FLASHING ON THE 

571
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:17,989
SCREENS THAT THE POLICE ARE 

572
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,358
EXPECTED TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON 

573
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:19,791
THE CASE. 

574
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,993
THAT WON'T BE UNTIL ABOUT 6 PM 

575
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,526
EASTERN TIME. 

576
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:22,828
THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE A LOT 

577
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,629
OF QUESTIONS ASKED OF THE 

578
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,665
POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS. 

579
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,166
I GUESS, THE ONE THING THAT YOU 

580
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,135
HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT IS THE 

581
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,870
ABILITY OF SOMEBODY TO DO 

582
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,140
SOMETHING NEFARIOUS BECAUSE OF 

583
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,776
THE LACK OF SECURITY CAMERAS 

584
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,412
AND EYEWITNESSES. AND I SORT OF 

585
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,847
FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING 

586
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,615
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE THIS 

587
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,985
COMMUNITY. 

588
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,320
WHAT IS A COMMUNITY LIKE 

589
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,989
BROOKLYN, IOWA, WHAT DO THEY DO 

590
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,090
IN THE WAKE OF SOMETHING LIKE 

591
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,290
THIS? 

592
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,892
AND I WONDER IF THERE IS A LOT 

593
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:58,430
THEY CAN DO. IS IT JUST ONE OF 

594
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,431
THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN 

595
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,468
THIS SMALL TOWN, BUT I CAN JUST 

596
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,836
IMAGINE A TOWN OF 1500 PEOPLE 

597
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,437
WERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EACH 

598
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,738
OTHER, THIS IS GOING TO BE 

599
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,508
EXTREMELY SHOCKING AND 

600
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,645
DEBILITATING. 

601
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,047
>> I WOULD THINK IF THE POLICE 

602
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,881
CONCLUDE RELATIVELY QUICKLY 

603
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,516
THAT THIS WAS A HOMICIDE, THAT 

604
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,851
WILL, THAT IS KIND OF SHOCKING 

605
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,320
FOR A SMALL COMMUNITY WHERE 

606
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,591
THEY DON'T HAVE HOMICIDES. 

607
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,392
I LIVE OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON 

608
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,160
DC. 

609
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,796
I SEE THE NIGHTLY NEWS. 

610
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:35,200
HERE IN CHICAGO, YOU HAVE 

611
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,134
HOMICIDES THAT OCCUR IN ALMOST 

612
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,135
A DAILY BASIS, SOMETIMES 

613
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:37,802
MULTIPLE OVER THE WEEKEND. 

614
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,270
THINK OF CHICAGO IN RECENT 

615
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,771
WEEKENDS. 

616
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,372
THE COMMUNITY IS ALMOST NUMB TO 

617
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,642
IT, ALTHOUGH VERY OFTEN 

618
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,643
OUTRAGED. 

619
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,944
BUT WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

620
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,145
A VERY SMALL RURAL COMMUNITY 

621
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,115
WHERE YOU HAVE NOT PERHAPS HAD 

622
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:54,820
A HOMICIDE IN YEARS, YOU THINK 

623
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,288
IN TERMS OF NEIGHBORS LOOKING 

624
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,557
AT NEIGHBORS SAYING, WHO DID 

625
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:58,757
THIS? 

626
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,525
WHO IS WALKING AMONG US THAT IS 

627
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,961
RESPONSIBLE? 

628
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:07,065
I AM SURE IT IS STUNNING IF IT 

629
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,067
TURNS OUT THAT WAY. IF IT TURNS 

630
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:16,408
OUT IT WAS A KIDNAPPING, FIRST, 

631
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,743
AND FOLLOWED BY A MURDER, IT IS 

632
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,877
STUNNING TO A SMALL COMMUNITY 

633
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:19,311
LIKE THIS. 

634
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,879
>> DO YOU FIND THAT, AND YOU 

635
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:21,847
STRESSED THAT IF IT TURNS OUT 

636
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,148
THAT WAY, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW, 

637
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,516
BUT DO YOU FIND THAT WHEN THERE 

638
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,851
ARE MURDERS LIKE THIS IN SUCH A 

639
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,019
SMALL COMMUNITY, SOMEONE KNOWS 

640
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:27,319
SOMETHING? 

641
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,654
BEYOND THE PERPETRATOR, SOMEONE 

642
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,623
ELSE HAS SEEN SOMETHING AND 

643
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,425
KIND OF TUCKED IT AWAY AND IS 

644
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,427
NOT SURE IF THEY SHOULD COME 

645
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,095
FORWARD, BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF 

646
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,732
THIS SORT OF BEING A COMPLETE 

647
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,433
SECRET KEPT BETWEEN THE 

648
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,334
PERPETRATOR AND THE VICTIM IS 

649
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,401
PROBABLY PRETTY LOW? 

650
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:48,607
>> THERE IS VERY OFTEN, WITH 

651
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,475
THIS, AND I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED 

652
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,776
ABOUT IT WITH ISIS INSPIRED 

653
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:55,747
ATTACKS, A LEAKAGE OF THE SIGNS 

654
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,315
OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS THIS SORT 

655
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,984
OF INTENT. 

656
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,985
WHAT LAW-ENFORCEMENT WILL BE 

657
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,854
TRYING TO DO IS KEEP THIS CASE 

658
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,157
ALIVE IN THE MEMORIES OF 

659
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,528
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, 

660
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,362
BECAUSE VERY OFTEN, SOMEONE SAW 

661
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,229
A SIGN. 

662
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:16,968
WHETHER IT IS SUBTLE OR BIG AND 

663
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,069
UGLY, SOMEONE SAW SOMETHING AND 

664
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:20,872
LAW-ENFORCEMENT IS DESPERATE TO 

665
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,340
GET THAT ONE TIP THAT CRACKS 

666
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,773
THIS CASE OPEN. 

667
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:26,044
WE WANT PEOPLE WHO MAY BE 

668
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:26,945
RESPONSIBLE FOR A KIDNAPPING 

669
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:27,879
LET ALONE A KIDNAPPING AND 

670
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,247
MURDER OFF THE STREETS OF 

671
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,150
AMERICA. SO LAW-ENFORCEMENT IS 

672
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,988
GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY BE VERY 

673
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,190
OFTEN AS DAYS AND WEEKS GO 

674
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,858
PAST, BE CREATIVE IN TRYING TO 

675
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,930
KEEP THIS IN THE PUBLIC EYE, 

676
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,064
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC CAN BE SO 

677
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,332
VALUABLE IN THESE CASES. 

678
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,801
LAW-ENFORCEMENT, ALONE, IS NOT 

679
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:54,206
THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THE 

680
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:54,706
CHALLENGES ABOUT CRIME. 

681
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,007
WE NEED THE PUBLIC AND MEDIA TO 

682
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,410
HELP GET THE WORD OUT. 

683
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,644
AND TO ENERGIZE THE PUBLIC AND 

684
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,745
HAVE THAT ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS 

685
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:04,282
SOMETHING COME ACROSS, PICK UP 

686
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,817
THE PHONE, CALL THE POLICE. 

687
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:14,659
AND GIVE A CLUE, A LEAD, AND 

688
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,061
HAVE THE POLICE START TO DO 

689
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,361
THEIR WORK. 

690
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,562
AND NARROW DOWN AND FOCUS AND 

691
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,296
POTENTIALLY GET A SEARCH 

692
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:18,596
WARRANT. 

693
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,433
AND GO AND TAKE AN OFFENDER OFF 

694
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:29,708
THE STREETS. 

695
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,775
>> $400,000 HAD BEEN RAISED, 

696
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,077
MONEY TO HELP FIND HER, NOW THE 

697
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,678
MONEY WILL GO TO ANYONE WHO CAN 

698
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,479
HELP GIVE INFORMATION LEADING 

699
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,513
TO THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE. 

700
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:36,515
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T NEED MONEY 

701
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,483
TO MOTIVATE YOU, BUT IF THAT IS 

702
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:43,388
WHAT IT TAKES, THERE IS A LOT 

703
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,389
OF MONEY OUT THERE. 

704
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,524
JUST TO CLARIFY HOW SOME OF 

705
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,591
THIS INFORMATION IS COMING TO 

706
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,293
US NOW, WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS 

707
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:53,832
THAT CRIMESTOPPERS SAID THEY 

708
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,833
LEARNED OF THE DISCOVERY FROM A 

709
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,834
CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND OF MOLLIE 

710
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,101
TIBBETTS. 

711
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,068
THAT IS WHERE THIS INFORMATION 

712
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,670
IS LEAKED FROM, ESSENTIALLY, 

713
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,805
THAT A BODY WAS FOUND, AND IT 

714
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:08,847
LOOKS LIKE IT IS, INDEED, HER. 

715
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:09,848
>> STANDBY ONE SECOND. 

716
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,615
AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 

717
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,850
EARLIER, WE SPOKE YESTERDAY TO 

718
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,320
A RETIRED FBI PROFILE -- 

719
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:24,496
PROFILER. WE ASKED WHAT THEY 

720
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,730
WERE LOOKING FOR WHEN IT COMES 

721
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,264
TO CLOSE. 

722
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:26,965
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID. 

723
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,466
>> I THINK IT WILL BE VERY 

724
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,534
HELPFUL TO LOOK AT HER SOCIAL 

725
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,735
MEDIA AS WELL, PARTICULARLY IN 

726
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:31,837
THE HOURS AND DAYS BEFORE SHE 

727
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:32,170
WENT MISSING. 

728
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,304
SO THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT, 

729
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:38,043
ÃºEV 

730
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:38,910
BEHAVIOR, HOW SHE COMES ACROSS, 

731
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,111
HER STATE OF MIND, DOES SHE 

732
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,212
SEEM DEPRESSED? 

733
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:42,881
DOES SHE SEEM DISTANT? 

734
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,517
THEY WILL LOOK AT WHO WAS SHE 

735
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:45,717
WITH? 

736
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,651
WHO WAS IN THE BACKGROUND? 

737
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,553
WHO WAS AWARE OF THE LAST 

738
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,221
VIDEOS THAT SHE POSTED? 

739
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:54,392
THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL 

740
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,293
TO INVESTIGATORS, AGAIN, AS 

741
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,529
THEY TRY TO RECONCILE WHO WAS 

742
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:02,834
THE MOLLY -- MOLLIE TIBBETTS ON 

743
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,371
SOCIAL MEDIA VERSUS BEHIND 

744
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,772
CLOSED DOORS, AND WHO ARE THE 

745
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:08,807
PEOPLE, IF ANY, THAT SHE IS 

746
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:09,107
AFRAID OF. 

747
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:13,111
SO WHAT YOU SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA 

748
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,212
BEAUTIFUL FACES, BUT DOES THAT 

749
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,447
REALLY REFLECT WHAT IS GOING ON 

750
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,214
IN HER PERSONAL LIFE? 

751
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:22,220
IT IS HELPFUL AND IT IS GOOD 

752
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,154
WHEN THEY ARE RECONCILING THAT 

753
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,323
TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN 

754
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,093
HER LIFE. 

755
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:38,469
>> WHEN WE PLAYED THAT BACK, 

756
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:39,838
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS STRUCK 

757
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,239
BY, BEFORE SHE WRAPPED UP HER 

758
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,107
COMMENTS, WHO MOLLY MAY BE 

759
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,208
AFRAID OF, THAT IS SOMETHING 

760
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,442
THAT I DON'T THINK WE TAKE INTO 

761
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,477
ACCOUNT WHEN WE LOOK AT 

762
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,377
SOMEONE'S SOCIAL MEDIA, A 

763
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:49,948
GENERALLY SHOWS THE WORLD HOW 

764
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,149
WE WANT THEM TO PERCEIVE US, 

765
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:51,983
WHICH IS GENERALLY HAPPY AND 

766
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,084
ENJOYING OUR LIVES. 

767
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,454
THE IDEA THAT YOU MAY BE AFRAID 

768
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,489
OF SOMEONE WHETHER IT IS AT 

769
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,790
SCHOOL OR IN THE COMMUNITY AND 

770
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,626
THAT IT MAY -- YOU MAY NOT BE 

771
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,460
WILLING TO SHARE THAT 

772
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,060
INFORMATION EXCEPT WITH CLOSE 

773
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,261
CONFIDENCE, THAT IS SOMETHING 

774
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:09,834
THAT COULD BE A THREAT THAT 

775
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:10,535
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT 

776
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,070
AND WE IN THE PUBLIC MAY NOT BE 

777
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,704
AWARE OF IT. 

778
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,938
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 

779
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:14,538
I MENTIONED EARLIER, VICTIM 

780
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:16,307
KNOWLEDGE HE, THAT IS WHAT MARY 

781
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:17,142
ELLEN IS DESCRIBING. 

782
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,209
WHAT DOES LAW-ENFORCEMENT KNOW 

783
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,679
ABOUT HER PATTERN OF LIFE? 

784
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,851
WHO ON HER SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU 

785
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:27,652
ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. 

786
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,820
WE PRESENT VERY OFTEN ON SOCIAL 

787
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,888
MEDIA THAT WHICH WE WANT TO 

788
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,955
PRESENT, AND WE CONCEAL THAT 

789
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:32,023
WHICH WE WANT TO CONCEAL. 

790
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,892
WHO WAS SHE BLOCKING FROM 

791
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,359
SOCIAL MEDIA? 

792
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,693
WHOSE PHONE CALLS WAS SHE 

793
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,529
BLOCKING? 

794
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,097
WHAT ARE HER CLOSEST FRIENDS 

795
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:43,168
SAYING ABOUT WOULD BE 

796
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,403
PARAMORE'S WHO REPEATEDLY OR 

797
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,906
INSISTENTLY ASKED HER ON A DATE 

798
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,207
AND IGNORE THE FACT THAT SHE 

799
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,975
HAD A BOYFRIEND, WHATEVER? 

800
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:54,179
THAT OTHER PART THAT IS OFTEN 

801
00:26:54,179 --> 00:27:00,685
UNSEEN, IT IS LAW-ENFORCEMENT'S 

802
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,686
JOB TO PROBE INTO THAT AS WELL. 

803
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,021
>> WHAT ABOUT THE VALUE OF 

804
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,122
SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN IT COMES TO 

805
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:04,723
THIS INVESTIGATION? 

806
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,725
>> I THINK THERE IS VALUE, 

807
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,393
BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE US SOME 

808
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,229
INDICATORS OF HER STATE OF MIND.

809
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,232
BEFORE THIS, WEEKS BEFORE, WHAT 

810
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,267
HAS BEEN GOING ON IN HER LIFE 

811
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,604
VERY OFTEN, PEOPLE POST THAT UP.

812
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,172
IT IS A PART OF THE ENTIRE 

813
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,676
MATRIX OF UNDERSTANDING, WHAT 

814
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,244
IS THIS PERSON ABOUT, WHAT 

815
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,313
MOTIVATED HER? WHAT DID HER 

816
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:33,418
LIFE LOOK LIKE IN ITS TRUEST 

817
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:37,422
FORM? 

818
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,423
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOVE 

819
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,424
WAS MEANT TO RECONSTRUCT PARTS 

820
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:39,757
OF THAT. 

821
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:40,825
WHAT HAS CHANGED ON SOCIAL 

822
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,058
MEDIA? 

823
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,227
OFTENTIMES, THAT IS VERY 

824
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,530
VALUABLE. 

825
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,399
OFTENTIMES YOU COULD PUT UP A 

826
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,234
PERSON IS IN A RELATIONSHIP, 

827
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,502
BUT THEY ARE NOT, WHAT HAS 

828
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,102
CHANGED OVER TIME? 

829
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,704
THAT MAY GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

830
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,475
SOME INDICATORS, AND AGAIN, 

831
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,176
PATTERN OF LIFE. 

832
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,811
WHAT DID SHE DO, HOW DID SHE DO 

833
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,145
IT? 

834
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,512
WHO DID SHE NORMALLY INTERSECT 

835
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:05,716
WITH? THOSE ARE ALL THINGS 

836
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:06,618
WHERE YOU CIRCLE INVESTIGATORS 

837
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:10,889
AND INTERVIEW EVERYONE THERE. 

838
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,893
>> WHO WAS THERE THAT MAY HAVE 

839
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,327
LOOKED AT HER AND COME INTO 

840
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:16,928
CONTACT WITH HER? 

841
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,196
STARTED TO THINK BAD THINGS 

842
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,164
ABOUT HER? 

843
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,133
I WANT TO KNOW ALL OF THAT. 

844
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,602
I DON'T WANT TO JUST KNOW ABOUT 

845
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,805
GENERALLY AREA SEX OFFENDERS, 

846
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,175
BUT PEOPLE WITH CONVICTIONS FOR 

847
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,409
VIOLENT CRIMES, I WANT TO KNOW 

848
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,478
ABOUT WHO DID SHE INTERSECT WITH

849
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,612
. THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN 

850
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:39,984
WHO IS IN THE AREA. 

851
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,819
>> THE NEWS IS THAT SHE WAS OUT 

852
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:45,089
FOR A JOG, AND OFTEN WE KEEP IT 

853
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:49,527
ROUTINE. 

854
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,329
>> WE MAY TAKE A RIDE OUT AT 8 

855
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,097
AM, OR AT 430, AND EVERY MEMBER 

856
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,934
SORT OF, AS A SECURITY LESSON, 

857
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,102
BEING OUT ALONE, BEING TOLD TO 

858
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:01,072
VARY YOUR SCHEDULES, BECAUSE AS 

859
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:06,177
SOMEONE KNOWS, IF THEY KNOW 

860
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,412
THEY WILL ALWAYS BE OUT AT 

861
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,713
6:30, THEY COULD BE WAITING FOR 

862
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:08,913
YOU. 

863
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,681
>> SAD BUT TRUE. 

864
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,017
I FIRST HEARD THE NEWS, I HAVE 

865
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,520
A YOUNG DAUGHTER, YOUNG ADULT 

866
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,156
NOW, BUT I AM JUST SHAKING MY 

867
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,992
HEAD THINKING FIRST, ISN'T IT 

868
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,560
WONDERFUL THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS 

869
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,199
IN A COUNTRY SETTING THE LEAVES 

870
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,834
IN THE HUMANITY OF THEIR FELLOW 

871
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,971
CITIZENS THAT THEY COULD GO OUT 

872
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,038
JOGGING AT NIGHT IN THE EVENING 

873
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,374
BY THEMSELVES IN A VERY REMOTE 

874
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:43,748
RURAL AREA AND FEEL SAFE. 

875
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,782
IT IS A WONDERFUL THOUGHT. 

876
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:45,917
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS NOT 

877
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,651
ALWAYS THE REALITY IN AMERICA 

878
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,753
WHERE YOU DO HAVE TOO MANY BAD 

879
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:48,986
PEOPLE. 

880
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:53,057
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LISTS OF IN 

881
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,125
YOUR STATE, YOU CAN VERY OFTEN 

882
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,493
PULL UP YOUR COMMUNITY AND LOOK 

883
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,795
AT WHERE REGISTERED SEX 

884
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,498
OFFENDERS ARE ASSOCIATED, YOU 

885
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,000
CAN SEE THEM IN EVERY 

886
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,403
COMMUNITY. 

887
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:12,210
>> THAT IS PRETTY DISTURBING. 

888
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,311
THERE ARE APPS FOR THAT. 

889
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,312
>> THAT IS PRETTY DISTURBING. 

890
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,480
>> DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE 

891
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,648
PEOPLE IN SUCH A SMALL 

892
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,448
COMMUNITY, THEY WOULD BE AWARE. 

893
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,483
THEY REPORT THAT THE 

894
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,217
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE 

895
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,551
AWARE OF WHO IS LIVING IN THE 

896
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:20,851
COMMUNITY. 

897
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,120
>> IT MAY BE DIFFERENT AND 

898
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,653
DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. 

899
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:23,054
>> IT IS. 

900
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,188
AND IF YOU HAVE THE AWARENESS 

901
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,290
AND INCLINATION, YOU MAY BE 

902
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,691
ABLE TO GO TO A LOCAL WEBSITE 

903
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,762
AND FIND WHERE SUCH PEOPLE ARE 

904
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:31,529
IN YOUR COMMUNITY. 

905
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,430
VERY OFTEN, WE ARE WORRIED 

906
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,498
ABOUT OUR KIDS, DOES MY CHILD 

907
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,867
WALKED BY THIS LOCATION ON THE 

908
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,535
WAY TO THE SCHOOL BUS OR ON THE 

909
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,002
WAY TO SCHOOL? 

910
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,603
BUT THIS APPLIES TO ADULTS AS 

911
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:42,540
WELL. 

912
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,875
AND IN THIS DAY AND AGE WITH 

913
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,377
CRIME THAT SOMETIMES SEEMS TO 

914
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,280
SURROUND US, I WOULD BE VERY 

915
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,546
WORRIED. 

916
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:51,182
I'VE CAUTIONED MY OWN DAUGHTER, 

917
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,818
WHEN YOU GO SHOPPING, LOOK 

918
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,720
AROUND BEFORE YOU GET INTO YOUR 

919
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,121
CAR. 

920
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,690
SEE IF SOMEONE IS WALKING 

921
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,925
TOWARDS YOU BECAUSE OF A 

922
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:01,458
POTENTIAL CARJACKING OR 

923
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:04,595
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. 

924
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:08,232
THOSE FOLKS ARE OUT THERE. 

925
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:10,601
I'M NOT TRYING TO INSTILL A 

926
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:16,941
SENSE OF PARANOIA IN MY CHILD 

927
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,343
OR OTHERS, BUT CRIME IS A 

928
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,610
REALITY, AND WE OUGHT TO TAKE 

929
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,878
STEPS TO BE AWARE OF OUR 

930
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:21,411
SURROUNDINGS AND PROTECT 

931
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:22,513
OURSELVES AGAINST SOMETHING BAD 

932
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,015
HAPPENING. 

933
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,551
AND HERE, SOMETHING DID HAPPEN. 

934
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,521
THAT SOUNDS AS THOUGH SHE HAS 

935
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,122
BEEN FOUND DEAD. 

936
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,324
WE DON'T KNOW THE CAUSE YET. 

937
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,059
BUT SOMETHING BAD EVIDENTLY DID 

938
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,162
HAPPEN. 

939
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,130
WHETHER SHE WAS STRUCK OR 

940
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,964
KIDNAPPED AND KILLED, SOMETHING 

941
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:40,731
BAD HAPPENED TO THIS YOUNG 

942
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:41,432
LADY. 

943
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:46,637
IT IS HORRIBLE. 

944
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:47,872
>> YOU TALK, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW 

945
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,307
ABOUT IT IN A RURAL AREA, BUT 

946
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,241
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 

947
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:50,775
THE PERPETRATOR. 

948
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:51,643
WE KEEP SAYING THAT. 

949
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,177
CERTAINLY THERE ARE REGISTERED 

950
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,480
SEX OFFENDERS EVERYWHERE AS RON 

951
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,681
POINTED OUT, BUT THERE ARE A 

952
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,815
LOT OF RESTRICTIONS ON THEM, 

953
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:58,616
THEY CANNOT LIVE CLOSE TO 

954
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,286
SCHOOLS OR PLAYGROUNDS, AND 

955
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:02,686
THIS AND THAT. 

956
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:03,821
YOU WOULD THINK THAT FURTHER 

957
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,056
OUT IN THE COUNTRY, IT WOULD 

958
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:05,957
GIVE THEM LESS OPPORTUNITIES TO 

959
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:06,624
VIOLATE THOSE RESTRICTIONS. 

960
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,858
THOUGH YOU MAY WANT TO THINK 

961
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:09,594
THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIVE OUT HERE 

962
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,763
WHO ARE UP TO NO GOOD, BUT THAT 

963
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,897
IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE. 

964
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,367
>> THE THING THAT I, HOW 

965
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,770
QUICKLY, RON, DO FEDERAL 

966
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,004
INVESTIGATORS, LOCAL POLICE, 

967
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:24,943
CLEAR FAMILY MEMBERS FROM, AND 

968
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,910
WE AREN'T POINTING FINGERS, BUT 

969
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,679
AS WE THINK ABOUT, WE HAVE BEEN 

970
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,148
TALKING ABOUT PERHAPS SOMEONE 

971
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,551
SHE KNEW, SOMEONE THAT WASN'T A 

972
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,453
PART OF HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY. 

973
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,722
I AM THINKING THAT BY THIS POINT

974
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,691
FIVE WEEKS DOWN THE ROAD, CAN 

975
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:41,893
WE ASSUME, AND THIS IS AN 

976
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:42,493
ASSUMPTION AND SPECULATION, 

977
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:46,964
THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE 

978
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,065
BEEN MORE OR LESS CLEARED? 

979
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:49,367
AND MY FOLLOW-UP QUESTION WOULD 

980
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,234
BE WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE STUDENTS 

981
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,969
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA? 

982
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,438
KIDS SHE MAY HAVE GONE TO 

983
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,206
SCHOOL WITH BUT DIDN'T LIVE IN 

984
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:55,472
THE TOWN? 

985
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:56,840
>> I THINK IT HAD BEEN REPORTED 

986
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:02,413
THAT HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS

987
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:02,914
WERE CLEARED. 

988
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,182
HER FATHER DOESN'T LIVE IN THE 

989
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,483
AREA AND HER BROTHERS WERE 

990
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,151
WORKING SEVEN MILES AWAY IN 

991
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:07,852
ANOTHER TOWN. 

992
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:08,886
BUT THAT IS THE INFORMATION WE 

993
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:09,320
ARE GETTING. 

994
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,928
RON, I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW 

995
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:17,929
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HOLDS BACK 

996
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,796
INFORMATIO FROM THE MEDIA. 

997
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,263
>> THEY DO. 

998
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,498
AND THERE WAS ALSO REPORTING 

999
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,532
THAT THE BOYFRIEND, WHO I THINK 

1000
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,034
WAS A PART OF THE INITIAL 

1001
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,370
MISSING REPORT WAS CLEARED AS 

1002
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,771
WELL. 

1003
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,572
SO IS THAT TRUE? 

1004
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,407
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT LAW 

1005
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,407
ENFORCEMENT WATTS PEOPLE TO 

1006
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:35,046
BELIEVE? 

1007
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,616
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A REASON TO 

1008
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:39,884
BE GUARDED ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY 

1009
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,052
AND WHAT THEY DO. 

1010
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,421
THEY ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT 

1011
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,823
THOSE IN CLOSEST PROXIMITY. 

1012
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,258
IS THERE A FAMILY CONNECTION 

1013
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,160
HERE? 

1014
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,561
WHAT DOES THE FAMILY LIFE LOOK 

1015
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:55,600
LIKE 

1016
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,303
>> IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT WITH 

1017
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,372
THE DISCOVERY OF HER BODY, NOW 

1018
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,673
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOME 

1019
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:03,408
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT 

1020
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,842
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE 

1021
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,577
ACCESS TO, DNA AND OTHER TYPES 

1022
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:14,284
OF EVIDENCE THAT, TO ME, IT 

1023
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:14,952
WOULD CLEARLY SUPERSEDE 

1024
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,120
ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD FIND ON 

1025
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,355
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT YOU HAVEN'T 

1026
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,589
FOUND OVER THE LAST FIVE WEEKS. 

1027
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:19,590
THINGS WE MAY HAVE ASSUMED 

1028
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,491
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CLEARED 

1029
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,859
MAY ALL OF A SUDDEN FALL BACK 

1030
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:22,960
INTO SUSPICION BECAUSE OF THE 

1031
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,828
DISCOVERY OF THE BODY? 

1032
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:24,762
>> THAT IS TRUE. 

1033
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,697
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK 

1034
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,934
ABOUT THE FIT BIT AND HER 

1035
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,369
PHONE, ARE THEY DISCOVERED ON 

1036
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:31,969
HER? 

1037
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,404
AND WHAT DOES THE SEARCH OF 

1038
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:40,178
THOSE DEVICES YIELD? 

1039
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,512
DOES THE LOCATION OF HER BODY 

1040
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,112
TAKE THE POLICE TO YET ANOTHER 

1041
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:45,016
LOCATION? 

1042
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,217
WE ARE NOW IN THE VERY EARLY 

1043
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,418
STAGES OF A DEATH 

1044
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:47,784
INVESTIGATION. 

1045
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:49,053
I THINK THERE IS MUCH TO BE 

1046
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,588
LEARNED FROM THE CONDITION OF 

1047
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,158
HER BODY AS WELL AS THE 

1048
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,193
LOCATION HERE, HOW FAR FROM 

1049
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,361
WHERE SHE WAS REPORTEDLY 

1050
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:01,499
JOGGING, HOW FAR FROM HER HOME, 

1051
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,967
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? 

1052
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,502
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE 

1053
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,071
SOME MORE DETAIL ON THAT WITHIN 

1054
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,572
THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS. 

1055
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:13,010
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 

1056
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,277
INSIGHT. 

1057
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,378
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

1058
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,381
COVER THIS BREAKING NEWS. 

1059
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,915
THE BODY OF MOLLIE TIBBETTS HAS 

1060
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:20,017
BEEN DISCOVERED. 

1061
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,786
WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS 

1062
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,287
WITHOUT ANSWERS. 

1063
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,190
LATER ON, WE WILL TALK TO MARY 

1064
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,658
ELLEN O'TOOLE, A FORMER FBI 

1065
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:32,597
PROFILER. SHE IS FASCINATED 

1066
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,098
WHEN IT COMES TO ANALYZING THE 

1067
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:39,270
POTENTIAL PERPETRATORS IN A 

1068
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,871
CASE LIKE THIS. 

1069
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,005
WE WILL TALK TO HER LIMIT 

1070
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,439
LATER. 

1071
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,640
THERE IS MORE NEWS GOING ON AS 

1072
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:42,940
WELL. 

1073
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,108
WE WILL GET TO THAT. 

1074
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,243
BEFORE THAT, WE TAKE A QUICK 

1075
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:45,476
BREAK. 

1076
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,744
YOU ARE WATCHING CBSN , CBS 

1077
00:35:46,744 --> 00:00:00,000
NEWS, ALWAYS ON.
