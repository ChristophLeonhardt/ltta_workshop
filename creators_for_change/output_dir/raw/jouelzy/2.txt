1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,938
- [Vlogger] Hey Guys!
Hopefully I'm not too orange.

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:03,821
I have orange curtains, but I'm probably

3
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:05,260
going to have to swap them out.

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,371
But I wanted to come and have

5
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:07,716
a quick discussion with you guys

6
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,379
about the midterm elections and

7
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,266
how to look forward, how I feel after

8
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:17,994
all the shenanigans and
the BS... Girl! (hmmph)

9
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:21,161
About that, so in 2016 when the whites

10
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:24,843
elected an orange popsicle
to the presidency,

11
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:27,744
I was clearly distraught and upset

12
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,583
and I did upload a video with

13
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,036
a very raw, emotions and feelings

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,352
towards what this, I'm remissed
to call him a president

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,026
what, the popsicle
Mussolini was going to mean

16
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:41,958
to us and our wellbeing, and I mean,

17
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,309
it is still a stressful
scenario, you know?

18
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,770
I think a lot of us, maybe
we just took for granted

19
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,791
that the Obama era did give
a lot of people a lot of hope

20
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,441
and a lot of, you know, a lot
of us became entrepreneurs,

21
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:55,600
a lot of us persuade businesses,
a lot of us just did things

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,160
because we felt like we could conquer

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,286
and I get that this is not new,

24
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:03,621
this is America at its core, I get that.

25
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,075
I just didn't necessarily want

26
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,117
to live through it at
this height, you know?

27
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:08,971
Like, it still doesn't feel good.

28
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,811
I wanted to come and talk
about the midterm elections

29
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:13,773
because I know that they
might not feel good either

30
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,468
because Beto O'Rourke didn't win

31
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:17,801
and we have contested elections in both

32
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,147
Georgia, with Stacey Abrams, and

33
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,128
then Florida, with Andrew Gillum,

34
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:22,625
and they have become some of the most

35
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,911
notable candidates running for office and

36
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:26,370
I have been consistent in saying

37
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,731
that local elections matter.

38
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:32,632
I have been very consistent
with that messaging.

39
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,622
This essentially was a local election

40
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:39,622
that got a lot of visibility
in the mainstream media.

41
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:43,118
Okay. So, for one, I just recently moved

42
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,299
from Dallas, Texas to
Charlotte, North Carolina.

43
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,772
I got to meet Beto
O'Rourke sometime around,

44
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:50,403
I feel like late 2016 or early 2017

45
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:53,612
because I was going to
Dallas Democrat meetings.

46
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:55,696
I was actually going to
Dallas Young Democrat meetings

47
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:58,008
and I was trying to find
a way to get more involved

48
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:00,957
in like, the political activism in Dallas

49
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:04,250
which, um, (clears throat) yeah, (grunts)

50
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,374
I ended up being very disheartened with

51
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:08,645
the state of the Democrats in Dallas

52
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,699
and so I started digging into the history

53
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,262
of like what is going on here because

54
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:16,749
the Democrat party in
Dallas is very old, white,

55
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:18,044
and I was like, you know there's

56
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,675
diversity here, why aren't there more,

57
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:23,408
particularly Latinos, where
are the black people at?

58
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:26,713
Like, I just didn't feel
like the constituency

59
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,965
of Dallas was really represented
in the Democrat meeting.

60
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:31,545
And, like, certain things that they did

61
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:33,065
just didn't make it very welcoming

62
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:35,068
or, like, something that you would want

63
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,537
to be a part of or invest time in.

64
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,578
And so, when I started to dig into it,

65
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,568
I was digging into the
political history of Texas

66
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:45,041
and realizing that, and
I've said this before,

67
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,106
even though Dallas and Houston and Austin

68
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:50,637
are considered blue dots in
a very red state, they are

69
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,977
actually homes to much of
the conservative movement

70
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:55,847
and the GOP and the
Republicans, over the years,

71
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:58,081
once they realized that they could not win

72
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:01,049
the presidency consistently,
you know there was

73
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,014
always gonna be this back and forth,

74
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,566
they switched their
energy in realizing that

75
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,052
they could never win the popular vote

76
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,436
for the presidency, but
that they would dismantle

77
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,828
a lot of federal regulations, by

78
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,708
controlling state and local governments

79
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,231
and therefore, essentially
dismantling the Democrat party.

80
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,791
Now, I know that there has
been this bubbling over

81
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,931
this conversation about not voting and

82
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:21,900
just not persuading the system

83
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,592
because a lot of us are frustrated

84
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:24,744
with this idea of only having

85
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:27,217
a two party system, but again

86
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:30,267
I always say this. Nothing
happens in a vacuum.

87
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:33,231
There is this large web of movement,

88
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:36,189
of pieces of a system that is built

89
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,829
to make sure that
capitalism and imperialism

90
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,991
always benefits the wealthy, but

91
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,906
if it's a small class of people.

92
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,710
Any sort of movement that we have had

93
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,298
towards civil rights towards opening up

94
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:49,114
the access and the equity towards,

95
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:53,621
largely via the government
during the Obama era,

96
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:57,240
was largely undone in
elements of government

97
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,852
that we as the public were
not paying attention to

98
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:03,422
because we came out and voted in 2008

99
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:04,722
and we elected a black man and

100
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:07,259
the Republicans went
into overdrive, right?

101
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:09,396
And a lot of us were just so happy

102
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:10,413
that black man got into office.

103
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:11,246
We thought that was gonna be the peak,

104
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:12,079
we thought it was gonna be great,

105
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,685
that we didn't pay attention to what

106
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,368
was happening on the
judiciary side of things, um

107
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:17,918
particularly within the supreme court,

108
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,223
with Citizens United, and I believe

109
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,713
it was another ruling with FEC,

110
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:22,021
I'm sorry if I'm talking so fast.

111
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:24,793
But, if you're wondering how I

112
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:26,091
even gather a lot of this information,

113
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,633
one of my favorite podcasts, and

114
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,107
I mention it often and people always like

115
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:33,150
"what's the name of the
podcast?" Girl! More Perfect.

116
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,304
More Perfect is actually
the name of the podcast

117
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,325
and I believe in season
two when they cover

118
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:41,041
Citizens United, is
there another FEC ruling?

119
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,227
I feel like (hmm) if there isn't,

120
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:46,016
it's all kind of covered in that episode

121
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:49,265
where they talk about
why that ruling mattered

122
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:51,228
and how it has an impact on our elections

123
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:54,182
and Texas is largely ground zero

124
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,569
for how Republicans went about

125
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,902
focusing on local and state elections

126
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:02,551
and how well they have been able to undo

127
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,743
the Democrat establishment
in the state of Texas

128
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:08,868
and that I can move to Texas
and try to get involved

129
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:11,641
as a younger person and just be entirely

130
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,727
turned off 'cause I'm
like what are y'all doing?

131
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,668
It just is very difficult. Now,

132
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:17,411
part of that is Texas has some

133
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,158
of the hardest voter
registration laws in the country.

134
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,810
It gets really murky because Texas,

135
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,155
being the ground zero for these

136
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,199
conservative movements and they're

137
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,064
not out somewhere in Jasper, Texas.

138
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,706
Like, these conservative
people are in Houston,

139
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:30,810
they're in Dallas and
they're in Austin. Right?

140
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,846
So, you have people like Crystal Mason

141
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:34,487
who went and filed a provisional vote

142
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:35,328
because her mother encouraged

143
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,073
her to go vote in the
presidential election

144
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:38,819
and she's like, "are you
sure? I just got out of jail".

145
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,371
So when she went to go vote and

146
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:41,929
she acknowledged that she wasn't

147
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:42,915
sure if she could vote or not,

148
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:45,344
she filled out a provisional ballot,

149
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,875
which basically means, until your vote

150
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:52,708
is verified as being valid,
your vote will not be counted.

151
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:54,707
She signed it and so technically

152
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,419
the caught her for voter fraud

153
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,550
and sent her to five years in
prison for mistakenly voting.

154
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,831
Now, another person in, I believe, in the

155
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:05,001
neighboring county,
probably somewhere in Plano,

156
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,871
is that still Tarrant or
is that Dallas County?

157
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,987
Another woman who had voted twice

158
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:12,535
as a Republican, got
probation for voter fraud.

159
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:15,135
We have to acknowledge what
Beto O'Rourke was overcoming.

160
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:17,588
Not only that, the biggest point is

161
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,042
Texas has one of the lowest turn out rates

162
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,948
for elections in the
country, hovering around 6%.

163
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:25,683
Ted Cruz's last election, he won

164
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:28,815
by like a 1.5 million margin,

165
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:31,901
so for Beto to lose by 200,000 votes

166
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:34,336
in a state where technically he

167
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:35,339
could not go register voters,

168
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,299
they can't run a campaign
to register voters, right?

169
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,197
It's very difficult, there's a lot of laws

170
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,454
around who can register, how to register,

171
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,571
like you can't even drive
people to the polls.

172
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,859
It's like, it's difficult, right?

173
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,416
For the spirit of his campaign,

174
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,185
to help motivate people on the ground,

175
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,260
not only to go vote, but
the amount of volunteers

176
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,383
and organizations that got
invested in Texas politics,

177
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:58,680
and to lose by that small of a margin,

178
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,180
without the support of superPACs,

179
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,407
like this was all money
donated from individuals.

180
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:07,109
That is a very huge deal in a state

181
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:10,996
that has been ground
zero for the Republicans'

182
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:14,241
strategy around local and state elections.

183
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,700
His campaign and this election cycle

184
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,522
did come with some smaller
victories down ballot,

185
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,680
in that down ballot politicians,

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,668
as in Colin Allred, who
ran for U.S. Congress,

187
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,585
against Pete Sessions, was able to

188
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:30,574
flip that seat in a
very Republican county.

189
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,754
Uh, we have the magistrate in Houston,

190
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,839
which is basically like the executive

191
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,830
who oversees the judges and someone

192
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,002
who was on track to
potentially run for governor,

193
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,585
lost his seat to a 27 year old.

194
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,683
Lina, fuck it up sis. Fuck it up!

195
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:50,389
I'm here for it. A 27
year old Hispanic woman.

196
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,461
Yas sis, eff it up for 'em. Be ethical.

197
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:55,039
We gone keep you on your nose.

198
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,839
We gone follow you. We
gone hold you accountable,

199
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,060
but sis, eff it up for them, alright?

200
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,333
Texas has a state
legislature that's basically

201
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,956
set up to ensure that even if you run,

202
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:05,483
and possibly win, it is very difficult

203
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,417
for you to hold that seat because

204
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,823
the state legislature meets for

205
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,343
five months out of the year, so

206
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:12,351
for five months out of the year,

207
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,099
you have to move to Austin for five months

208
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,755
and sit in the legislature
and then the governor

209
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:19,058
can call this legislature
whenever he wants.

210
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,906
So, even though they
meet from January to May,

211
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,345
if the governor decides, "oh, y'all aint

212
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:24,836
do something the way I like,
I wanna call y'all back,"

213
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,944
at any time he could call congress up

214
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:28,373
and y'all gotta come sit for a week.

215
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,437
So, basically you just
need to have a house,

216
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:33,212
a room, or a home. You
know for a lot of people,

217
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,366
economically, putting
yourself in this position

218
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,595
because you cannot take campaign monies

219
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:40,203
to fund yourself is very difficult.

220
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:42,272
That's why you will see
in Texas local elections,

221
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,006
particularly it's a lot of older,

222
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,570
even when it is black, they old,

223
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,797
they wealthy, and they out of touch.

224
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,426
We needa get the railroad
commissioner out of here.

225
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:51,734
That's the real gag in Texas.

226
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,465
That's tied to oil
and all the other stuff

227
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:56,741
and that's why can't get Amtrak
in the damn state anyways.

228
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:59,237
We're going off topic though, here.

229
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,820
But, what I wanna say to take
away from the Beto campaign

230
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,301
is that, like, to lose
by that small of a margin

231
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:06,709
is historic in its own right.

232
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,545
Like, Texas elections for Republicans are

233
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,750
won in margins of 2 million. Now, I see

234
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,798
a lot of people campaigning that

235
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:15,375
suggesting that he should
run for president in 2020

236
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,591
and I think that's interesting because

237
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,249
there is another senate election.

238
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:19,082
I don't think he has a chance

239
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:22,715
in Hell of beating John Cornyn, ooh girl.

240
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,909
That would be just such
an expensive election,

241
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,038
that I get why I'm seeing people say

242
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:29,600
he should run for
president because by time

243
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,416
we put all that money into
an election against Cornyn,

244
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,182
you might as well just run
for the presidency anyway,

245
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:37,079
but I really wish we could
get these Republicans

246
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:38,867
out of here and a lot
of that comes down to

247
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,043
registering for people to vote

248
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,266
and now that organizations and volunteers

249
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,297
have been motivated on the ground

250
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,977
because of Beto election, I think

251
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:47,816
we need to keep up that pace and

252
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:50,561
keep up participating, or volunteering

253
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:53,424
and knocking on doors and making calls

254
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,396
and helping people understand their rights

255
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,695
as citizens of this country and

256
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,811
getting people registered to vote.

257
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:00,143
And I think I was,
earlier, making this point

258
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:03,396
about the two party system,
its a function of capitalism.

259
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:06,715
It is very difficult to run
outside of the two parties

260
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:09,353
because part of how
you finance a campaign.

261
00:10:09,353 --> 00:10:12,753
So, one of the other benefits
of Beto and his notoriety

262
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:15,777
was a lot of that money
helped down ballot politicians

263
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,656
in that a lot of smaller politicians

264
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:19,468
who might not get the sort of

265
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:23,173
mainstream visibility, it's been notable

266
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:26,923
for plenty of the bigger
politicians who run,

267
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,586
particularly Hilary Clinton,
both Abrams and Gillum

268
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,303
and Beto, that they have used

269
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,910
some of their monies to help finance

270
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,895
smaller campaigns for like school boards,

271
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:37,718
for state senate, state congress.

272
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:40,003
All these sort of movements help

273
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:43,560
members of those
communities be able to vie

274
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,823
to run for office and its not just about

275
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:47,197
individuals running for office,

276
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:48,989
it is that your are represented,

277
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:51,038
that your community and your
concerns are represented

278
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:53,444
because a lot of what
happens in the government,

279
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,223
focuses, there is no way to check out

280
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:57,412
from the United States
government and not be impacted.

281
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:59,744
You might think you gone
stop paying taxes, cool sis,

282
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,477
but the way you access healthcare,

283
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,105
obviously, when you
wanna buy a plane ticket

284
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:06,633
and why ticket costs, why it costs

285
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,281
so doggone much to fly
from Charlotte to Atlanta

286
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:10,842
like, basic stuff. Your ability

287
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:12,237
to get on the train and go some place.

288
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:15,272
How much you pay for your car.
The gas you put in your car.

289
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:17,728
The things you see on TV.
Your ability to log onto

290
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:20,596
the internet, the government
has a function in all of that.

291
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:24,789
So, it just behooves you to be
invested in not only voting,

292
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,960
but keeping your politicians accountable.

293
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,296
With Gillum and Abrams,
going into a recount,

294
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:33,005
I believe Abrams will
likely go into a re vote.

295
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:34,686
You just have to
understand, along with Beto,

296
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:37,116
these are now, you're
talking about black people

297
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:39,681
running for governor,
in southern states where

298
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,730
Texas might be ground zero, but Georgia

299
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,721
and Florida are right behind them, right?

300
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:47,141
In that the, you have Stacy Abrams

301
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:51,391
running against the man
who controls the elections.

302
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:54,816
Sis! Most of us would never even

303
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:56,779
put up that sort of fight and that

304
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,671
not only is she putting up the fight,

305
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:00,106
and I had the chance to meet Stacy.

306
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:02,867
Man, I really be like, I be forgetting

307
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,845
like how actively involved I be in stuff.

308
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:08,261
I met Stacy in 20, did
I meet her last year?

309
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,989
I feel like I met her last
year at a dinner in Atlanta.

310
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:13,127
And I had just gone to an Annie's List

311
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,162
and Annie's List is an organization,

312
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:16,282
a national organization, that gives women

313
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,063
training on how to run for office.

314
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,366
So, if you are interested
in running for office

315
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:21,078
or even just supporting
someone to run for office,

316
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,813
definitely check out Annie's List.

317
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:24,687
And I had gone to one of the meetings

318
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:27,941
in Dallas, up in Plano,
and one of the women

319
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:30,132
who had ran for school board was talking

320
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:31,452
about her election and particularly

321
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,393
the uniqueness of black
women running for office

322
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:36,176
and the sacrifice it is for us to run

323
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:39,006
and I'm just thinking, (clicks tongue)

324
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:40,859
she had made a comment about needing

325
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,167
a good support system and that

326
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,600
often times you need, and the importance

327
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,044
of, if you were in a relationship

328
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:49,220
to make sure that that person
is really gonna support you

329
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,584
and Stacey Abrams is
single and I definitely

330
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:54,501
asked Stacey about, that I feel like

331
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:59,912
either you see black women
run for office later in life,

332
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,550
like you have the Maxine
Water and the EBJs

333
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,383
and the Sheila Jacksons, but as in

334
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,401
they have older children. Their children

335
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:10,520
are at least in their teen years,

336
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,492
but you don't see necessarily
younger black women run

337
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,087
and if we are running
in child bearing age,

338
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,831
a lot of us are just
single while we're making

339
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:21,933
this sacrifice, especially
to run for higher offices

340
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,281
and now that I've gone through training

341
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,378
I'm just realizing that
a lot of that is because

342
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:27,531
of the odds that are stacked against us

343
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,984
and the sacrifices that it
takes for us to run for office

344
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:31,977
and that we really do
have to martyr ourselves.

345
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,630
So your entire life is exposed

346
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,418
people will dig into you, and most men

347
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:38,967
just aren't gonna stick around
for that because patriarchy

348
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:40,722
is gonna patriarchy
and they don't have to.

349
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:43,517
I don't remember exactly
how I phrased my question

350
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:45,156
'cause I feel like when I asked it,

351
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,333
I was realizing this
really aint a question,

352
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,882
this a statement, girl, and
I wanna talk to you about it

353
00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:51,415
'cause I feel you and
Stacey had said to me,

354
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,990
"sis you right and it just is what it is".

355
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,952
She's like, you know, either
I'm gone be passionate

356
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,565
about this or I'm gone
be passionate about that

357
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:00,062
and, you know, maybe it'll come

358
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,552
and happen for me. Maybe
family and a relationship

359
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:03,865
will happen for me, but right now

360
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,982
I understand the sacrifice
that I wanted to make,

361
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,185
and I made it and I'm
going to push forward.

362
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,520
An I was like, you know what sis,

363
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,249
I'm very proud of you, (claps)

364
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:14,211
Okay? Stacy need to win the governorship

365
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:15,762
as far as I'm concerned. Eff Brian Kemp.

366
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:17,516
Somebody need to put him in jail.

367
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:20,342
He's a scab. He's a fraud
and I'm not here for it.

368
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:22,473
As much anxiety as watching that election

369
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:24,321
gave me on election night, and to watch

370
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,250
a white man just get away with

371
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,427
doing whatever he obscenely wants to,

372
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:29,765
I'm particularly proud to see

373
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:31,586
Stacy put up this fight and I want us

374
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,516
to understand how much
support she does need

375
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:35,790
because this is a great sacrifice.

376
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,102
It is a very unique place that she is in

377
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,446
as a black woman to put up the sacrifice

378
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:44,077
and largely, you know, she doesn't have

379
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:47,140
a spouse to go home to who supports her

380
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,776
the same way that maybe
Andrew Gillum's wife,

381
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:50,587
you know, supports him
and it's just different

382
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:52,423
the way that black women
have to approach things.

383
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:55,340
So, I'm here for it um, and it like

384
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,716
I am probably gonna get my behind

385
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:01,031
in the car and have to drive to Georgia

386
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:03,961
and knock on some doors
and put in some hard labor

387
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,435
to volunteer for sis
because she deserves it.

388
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:09,225
I hope we all pay more attention

389
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,324
to our local elections and volunteer

390
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:14,763
and get invested in the off season, right?

391
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,337
Because a lot of voter registration,

392
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:17,657
there's a lot of things happening

393
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:21,072
in our local legislatures,
especially about healthcare,

394
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:25,232
around housing, around fines
and fees with the courts

395
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:28,371
and bail, and different ways
for us to be involved in,

396
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,401
you can't just go vote and then check out,

397
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,729
you have to vote and
hold people accountable.

398
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,097
That's kind of pretty much how I feel

399
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,850
about this most recent midterm election.

400
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,717
Um, I do believe the whole system

401
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,994
needs to come crashing down, but

402
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:42,356
I continue to participate in the system

403
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,647
it's like living with a disease, right?

404
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,940
And I can improve my quality of life

405
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,780
by seeking treatment and
so I am the treatment.

406
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,947
My voting, my awareness,
my educating my audience,

407
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:58,143
my investment in this is
me treating the disease

408
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:00,840
until we find a way to
rip that shit out my body.

409
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,605
Right? Like can we remove this wholly

410
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,232
from the body and get rid of it

411
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:06,242
and redo it again and I also think that

412
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,326
in order to change a system, we have to

413
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,653
understand what the
system is as a plague`,

414
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,469
and so there is a lot of education

415
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:14,241
that needs to happen
for the general public

416
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,381
to understand what's happening

417
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:18,048
so that this huge change that we

418
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,166
wanna see happen can happen because

419
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,576
we're currently getting
a lot of resistance

420
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:24,328
from it because so many of us,

421
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:25,875
not just the white folks
that watch Fox News,

422
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,679
I mean Fox News won't
ruin it for all of us,

423
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,565
trust, you need Fox News as
a propaganda hole to Hell.

424
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:33,022
Alright? But there's plenty of us that are

425
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:36,331
getting our education from Facebook memes,

426
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:39,079
who are living in our own eco-chambers

427
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:41,590
and I'm just trying to encourage us all

428
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,811
to be more aware and invested and involved

429
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:46,420
and, you know, if the white people

430
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,133
need to be shipped off to Gilead,

431
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,992
we let them do that to
themselves, but, you know,

432
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,906
us over here, we gone
get it together, right?

433
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:54,120
We gone be ready to
dismantle this whole system

434
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,907
and improve it and not implement

435
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:58,622
the same ways of our oppressors

436
00:16:58,622 --> 00:16:59,455
and call it liberation 'cause

437
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:00,642
that's not how that shit work. Alright?

438
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:01,851
(sigh)

439
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,093
It was a mouth full. I hope people

440
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:04,246
can understand what I talked about.

441
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:07,193
Alright. Thanks for
watching. But if any of you

442
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,242
live in Mississippi, please
tell me what is going on.

443
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:11,770
Please, let me know how I can help

444
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:13,065
'cause I might have to
drive out to Mississippi

445
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,866
and campaign for voter
registration out there too,

446
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,503
'cause people winning by 700,000 votes

447
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,572
in a state with 3 million people

448
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,897
is just beyond me, if
there was some success

449
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:23,294
in a local election near you,

450
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:24,721
please let us know down below and

451
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:26,117
if there is an organization
that you feel like

452
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,428
that you're aware of locally,
that's been helping folks,

453
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:30,266
let us know down below, like lets help us

454
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,936
get invested because sometimes, you know,

455
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:35,314
it's kind of hard sometimes because

456
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,311
everyone doesn't know how to
make themselves more visible

457
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:39,657
on the internet, so, you know,

458
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,082
you talking about what's happening

459
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:41,987
and you sharing that with other people

460
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:43,873
is a great way to get
people more involved.

461
00:17:43,873 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, comment down below
and I'll holla. Deuces!
