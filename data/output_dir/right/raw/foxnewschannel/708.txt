1
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:09,397
>> MITT ROMNEY TOOK A BIG STEP

2
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:11,532
TOWARD GETTING A JOB IN

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:11,933
WASHINGTON.

4
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:14,469
MAYBE NOT THE ONE HE WANTED, BUT

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,538
HE HAS TAKEN A BIG STEP BY A

6
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:18,473
VICTORY IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIME

7
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:19,107
FOR SENATE.

8
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:27,849
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,418
MITT ROMNEY HAS A 74% TO 26%

10
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,393
GOVERNOR ROMNEY ADDRESSED HIS

11
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:42,130
SUPPORTERS HERE AND SAID TO BE

12
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:43,264
GREAT, YOU HAVE TO FIRST BE

13
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:43,564
GOOD.

14
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,904
GREAT STATE OF UTAH, I WILL DO

15
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:52,340
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO KEEP

16
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:56,310
AMERICA STRONG AND MAKE SURE OUR

17
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:04,385
SURE MY EXAMPLE AS A LEADER IS

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,636
IN A STATE OVER HALF MORMON AND

19
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:23,604
HE HAS LIVED IN UTAH FOR 10

20
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:24,472
YEARS.

21
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:26,774
THE BIG NATIONAL QUESTION FOR

22
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:27,108
ROMNEY:

23
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,310
WILL HE BE A CRITIC OF PRESIDENT

24
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:29,610
TRUMP?

25
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,548
>> IF I GET TO WASHINGTON, I

26
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:34,882
WILL WORK WITH HIM ON THE

27
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:36,584
POLICIES I THINK ARE RIGHT AND

28
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,419
OPPOSE THE THINGS I THINK ARE

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,188
WRONG FOR THE COUNTRY AND SPEAK

30
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,957
MY MIND ON ISSUES OF CONSCIENCE.

31
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,293
>> ROMNEY HAD A FAMOUS FEUD WITH

32
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:48,396
TRUMP IN 2016.

33
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:52,433
THE ATTACKS WERE VICIOUS.

34
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,936
AFTER TRUMP WON, ROMNEY STOOD

35
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:55,670
DOWN.

36
00:01:55,671 --> 00:02:00,208
THE 2 MEN MET WHEN HE WAS

37
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,244
CONSIDERED FOR SECRETARY OF

38
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:04,111
STATE.

39
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:07,515
ROMNEY SAID TRUMP WILL WIN A

40
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:07,915
RE-ELECTION.

41
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,118
BUT ROMNEY HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF

42
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,954
TRUMP'S TONE AND SEPARATING

43
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:15,656
FAMILIES AT THE BORDERS.

44
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:16,490
ADVICING TRUMP?

45
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:16,824
NO WAY.

46
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,526
>> MY JOB IS TO GET THINGS

47
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:19,560
THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

48
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,596
THAT ARE RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY.

49
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,431
I WON'T TRY TO MANAGE THE WHITE

50
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:30,972
THAT'S UP TO HIM AND HIS TEAM.

51
00:02:30,973 --> 00:00:00,000
>> ROMNEY WILL TAKE ON THE
