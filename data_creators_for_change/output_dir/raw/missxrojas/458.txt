creation which the only enforcer

42
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,530
downside was a tundish the strange

43
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,360
purple potion once you eat another

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,799

63
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,730
side and a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> on advancing side but</font>

two slices it was amazing things so so

68
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,620
good and the great thing about America

69
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,600
is that if you can't finish it they give

70
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
you these great little boxes that's

71
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,420
something common to a lot of America you

72
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just ask for box if you haven't</font>

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,940
finished your food and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font>

74
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">home with you so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of makes up</font>

75
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,490
for the insane amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> food that they</font>

76
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,260
did you everywhere and also the slightly

77
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,270
higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and because i</font>

78
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,670
was eating at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all evening something that</font>

79
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,350
me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> wife rabri</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really got into was</font>

80
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,180
making sandwiches<font color="#E5E5E5"> she also went to the</font>

81
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,830
farmers market and bought lots of

82
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,480
berries and things went into the beach

83
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,250
so trying everything to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

84
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,620
picnic style and also state buses but

85
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,510
money worked out really well the end and

86
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,220
we just ended up craving sandwiches all

87
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,270
the time in America they didn't put

88
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,830
butter on sandwiches how weird is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

89
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,260
so it everyone looked at me but

90
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,820
strangely when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was buttering my breads</font>

91
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,830
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion and unsurprisingly</font>

92
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,600
Southern California has amazing food

93
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,700
especially if you're a vegetarian<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

94
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,320
are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of chain options available if</font>

95
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,940
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chain kind of person but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

96
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,530
recommend stepping outside the box

97
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's lots of great</font>

98
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,680
independent places to try so thanks for
