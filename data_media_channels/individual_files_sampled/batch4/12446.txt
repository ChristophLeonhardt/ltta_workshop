fe okay lot to get to today i want to start out basically by i'm just gonna be honest with you I'm just gonna lay this on the table I want someone to pay me $10,000 to debate them why what I didn't note it all I'm on Twitter all the time everybody's offering 10,000 20,000 a hundred thousand dollars to debate them on how terrible socialism is I'll settle for a hundred bucks you know that Ben doesn't pay me you know that I'm here in this broom closet wasting away over here I was living in a dumpster in an alternate universe you some money honey the way this all began if you're a little confused on who's offering who money for what this began because Alexandria Casio Cortez said that the Republicans are afraid to debate her Alexandria Cassio Cortes Wow Wacka we will talk to a nobel-prize Michael Wacha Wacha she said that there Republicans are afraid to debate her so Bennett says I will debate you I in fact I will donate $10,000 to your campaign to debate you on the merits of socialism so she didn't want to do that obviously she said it was cat calling I don't I don't know how she came up with this one she said that accepting a debate challenge say challenging someone to a bed accepting debate challenge he's cat calling why did she say that I'll allow Alexandria to explain in her own words I am NOT the expert on geopolitics on this issue hmm it makes a lot of sense she's not the expert she didn't know she that's fair enough so she says she's not gonna do it Alexandria Cassio Cortes Jenny from Yorktown Heights says I'm not going to take this debate so then they turn it up a notch she pulled the gender card so then Candice Owen says I'll give you 20 grand and I think charlie Kirk said we'll give you a hundred grand and then I don't know if the number is it like a hundred billion dollars right now or something but either way she's not going to do it why won't she why won't she do it one of the responses that the Democrats have all lined up on is she's just running this one congressional race she only has to debate her opponent she only has to debate her opponent she doesn't need to debate random people like for instance the guy with the biggest conservative talk show in the country you know as you don't need to do that right you don't need to do that she if she had just stuck to her race then she wouldn't have to but she has positioned herself as the future of the Democratic Party the head of the DNC Tom Perez says that Alexandria Ocasio Cortes is the future of the Democrat Party she is going all around the country she's stumping for candidates in Michigan she's raising money in California she stumped for that one candidate she went out and gave her introduction then forgot to introduce the candidate she was endorsing because it's all about her she's the future of the party she's positioned herself this way if you're going to be the future of the party then you have to debate people then you have to be out there in the public arena and talk to people outside of New York's 14th congressional district which is very Rd is New York's 14th congressional district is something like 90% Democrat it's a D+ 21 district I think or D plus 29 district it is solidly Democrat so she's got to think outside of here if if she wants to or if she wants to be the head of that party but she isn't going to do that this gets to part of the Democrats problem with free speech right now because she's made herself this superstore if she wants to be the superstore why not why not engage in the free exchange of ideas what what is stopping her I get practically what's stopping her she doesn't know anything and she sounds very foolish every time she goes on TV I see the practical reason but then maybe she shouldn't be the head of the party she won't she will not take the money no matter how high the numbers go up she won't take the money meanwhile money is pouring in to Peter struck Peter struck you'll remember that name he's the guy who texted his girlfriend the girl he was having an affair with his colleague and said I'm gonna stop Trump from becoming president don't worry he'll never become president as he's investigating President Trump as he's working in the FBI during the 2016 election got fired from the mulher a campaign if you don't remember him here is Peter struck looking like a demon before before trey gowdy in congress your testimony is Bob Muller did not kick you off because of the content of your text he kicked you all because of some appearance that he was worried about my testimony what you asked and what I responded to was that he kicked me off because of my bias I'm stating to you it is not my understanding that he kicked me off because of any bias that it was done based on the appearance if you want to represent what she said accurately I'm happy to answer that question but I don't appreciate what was originally said being changed I don't give a damn what you appreciate agent struck I don't appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016 Oh trey Gowdy why are you going away why are you leaving that that's struck he comes off as smug he had this weird sort of demonic smile look on his face during his testimony but how smug this is a guy the audacity of his GoFundMe campaign is jaw-dropping this is a guy who has worked his entire life on the public dole right he's worked a taxpayer expense his entire life then he was caught being corrupt he's caught cheating on his wife with a co-worker promising her that he's going to use the power of the state the coercive power of the state to undermine a democratic election to undermine a presidential election to subvert that election and prevent Donald Trump from becoming president he then just waits he just sits around he says I'm not gonna resign I'm not gonna quit finally they were able to push this guy out of the bureaucracy what's the first thing he does he puts his hand out again and says give me more money I need more money give me more of your money and the American people really just lefties they give him more money they we must be so rich right now because of the Trump economy that money is literally burning a hole in people's pockets that they're gonna give it to this schmuck it is unfathomable he puts up his his GoFundMe campaign and I believe the limit was $150 at $150,000 that's what he wanted he has now had to up that limit twice because people keep pouring money in do you know how much this guy has raised $300,000 because he got fired for being terrible at his job and corrupt and trying to subvert democratic processes he's raised three hundred thousand dollars that's what the left has rewarded him with three hundred thousand dollars that by the way isn't nearly three hundred dollars per minute if you if you factor in all of the waking hours that we have this guy's making about three hundred bucks per minute they've raised it twice here's what the GoFundMe campaign says this is what's written on what Peter struck a man who has spent his entire life working to help keep us and our nation's safe has been fired he needs your help for the last year Pete his work and his character have been the target of highly politicized attacks including frequent slanderous statements from President Trump who actively and apparently successfully pressured FBI officials to fire Pete no no he wasn't the target of politicized attacks he is the politicized attack he politicized the FBI to attack a presidential election in to attack president Trump what he did it's unbelievable I told you yesterday was the projection day for the Democratic Party it was the I know you are but what am i day they constantly project what they're doing on to their opponents the the go fund me goes on Peter struck is a proud husband and father and I end the show there I how am I supposed to make fun of that Peter struck the only reason we know this guy's name is because he was cheating on his wife with a co-worker with he wasn't even just cheating on his wife with Sally from the diner he was actually cheating on his wife so violating their their marriage and violating the bonds of his with himself and his employer who is the American people he's working for the American people he's working in the government at an executive agency a law enforcement agency that demands integrity and he's cheating on his wife with his coworker he's a proud husband and father are you kidding me he goes on a veteran of the US Army and counterintelligence special agent who spent more than two decades in a job he loved at the FBI yeah I bet you loved the job I bet you loved the job I bet you loved feeling empowered to subvert presidential elections I bet you loved apparently having little dalliance 'as with your coworkers I bet you loved that feeling like you controlled the power of the state to stop the American people from selecting the president that they want I'm sure you loved it tough noogies buddy it goes on but last week in a decision apparently driven by political pressure a senior FBI official chose to fire Pete the the reason you were fired is because you were horrible at your job and you violated the trust of the American people the shocking story here is not that that Peter struck was fired the shocking story is that he was allowed to keep his job as long as he did which just shows you the inertia of the federal bureaucracy it shows you why we have to slash the power and size and scope of the federal bureaucracy but he kept his job anyway unbelievable $300,000 this guy gets the left now is pouring money giving money to a lecherous criminal bureaucrat that's where they think the money should go where else could this money go I don't know like any charity could go there why don't they give it they're always whining about how federal government doesn't have enough money why don't they give their money to the federal government no they're giving it to this lecherous creep this little twerp who lives his whole life on the taxpayer on taxpayer handouts while simultaneously violating the public trust and then he demands more money puts his hand out no shame whatsoever no show could you imagine the shame you get fired for your job for violating the public trust and cheating on your wife and you trying to subvert a presidential election and then the first instinct is gimme gimme gimme I can't support myself gimme gimme gimme so pathetic what a little twerp and they're giving money to that guy the left is giving money to that guy and it's this all ties in with the debates this all ties in with with free speech because the the left right now it feels an utter disdain for the essence of this country it feels a disdain for freedom for the freedom that the United States represents and for the country and for the countrymen why did they like Peter struck because Peter struck tried to use the power of the state in his own words he boasts about it in his own words using the power of the state to stop Americans from electing the president they want and the left doesn't like freedom doesn't like the country doesn't like the American country they applaud people when they protest the flag itself the symbol of the country and they don't like their countrymen they slander them with all sorts of nonsense constantly calling them Nazis and white supremacists anybody who's to the left of Vladimir Lenin is a Nazi all of a sudden Rove white supremacists or something that's why they like him because Peter struck apposed freedom he opposed democratic order he opposed his country in his countrymen that's why they like it you see that same thing with the debate they won't debate the Left will not debate we're offering them $100,000 they won't debate why they don't want to engage with us they can't defend their point of view they need censorship it's all about shut down censorship back off block you on Twitter give money to the lecherous creep who tries to subvert democracy it's all about that I was on Fox and Friends so at this weekend and we were talking about this these teachers in Boston or in a Massachusetts suburb who openly admitted that they were going to become liberal propagandists they were going to disregard objectivity in their teaching that they were going to brainwash their students there they're admitting this in a in a meeting that has been uncovered we were discussing this on Fox & Friends and and Edie Henry and Abby Huntsman repeated multiple times if you're one of these teachers and you want to come on and have your voice heard come on we'll have you on come on come on the show we'll have you on but you don't see that from the left you don't see the left saying come on and we'll talk it's only the right that does that it's only right leaning networks like Fox like us I've many Democrats have I invited on this show every day I try to win by Democrats on this show two people have taken me up on that one of whom is Tom Arnold and I was great I had a good time doing that we're the right is constantly inviting people in constantly inviting people to talk the left will not do that the left never has an actual Republican on their networks who was the last Republican to actually go on CNN yeah actually I know they had Anna Navarro on all the time someone who took to my knowledge has never once actually advanced the Republican or conservative cause but she's they call her a Republican strategist because she plays one on CNN you know Anna Navarro who all of these people who's the oh that one who's so awful in the what Jennifer Rubin they pretend that Jennifer Rubin is a lifelong lefty they pretend that she's a Republican or a conservative we don't have people on and now you're seeing big tech do this you know look you saw that they banned Alex Jones from YouTube and Facebook now they banned Gavin McGinnis from Twitter who knows who's next they're getting a progressively more mainstream Eve even Noam Chomsky thinks this is bad no less a lefty than Noam Chomsky thinks this is a terrible thing and opposes the censorship of people like Alex Jones if you aren't familiar with Noam Chomsky here's it here's an example of a bygone day of your when the left was willing to engage in discourse here is Noam Chomsky on Bill Buckley's firing line I've rejoice in your disposition to argue the Vietnam question especially when I recognize what an act of self-control this must involve it does sure it really does I mean I think there's a kind of issue sometimes I lose my temper maybe not because as you would have smashing the gun you said you say in your reason for not losing you say the war is simply an obscenity a depraved act by weak and miserable men including all of us including myself including every that's the next sentence citizens so you heard that the Vietnam War is a weak and miserable act but undertaken by depraved men this is not a moderate person this is not this is a far left person Noam Chomsky but even he is saying this tendency of the left to just censor to refuse to engage to refuse to debate he's on Bill Buckley show Buckley is actually making a joke about his debate with gore Vidal on television where he said if you don't record crypto Nazi or I'll smash you in your damn face and don't stay plastered you queer you know it goes on and on he's making a joke about this and they're laughing about this and engaging in an exchange of ideas this no longer happens the right now a big tech is escalating its attacks big tech is controlled by the left the people who run these companies are left wingers they're under immense pressure from the left right now because the left blames big tech for the 2016 Trump victory they blame Facebook for allowing conservative news so-called fake news to pervade the platform they blame Twitter for the Russian BOTS everything's a Russian but I'm a Russian bot and they are constantly blaming big tech they're under pressure and they're caving there they're censoring people right now this is bad and I get really sick and tired of even conservatives who say well big tech they can do whatever they want it's not a big deal they can do whatever they want the First Amendment doesn't they have the they have their rights to speech it's the First Amendment that's fine yes nobody duh nobody disagrees with you that a company can do what it wants to do although one has to remember if you're a plaid you're a publisher there are certain rules that go along with that but yeah nobody is saying that they can't do it we're saying they shouldn't do it we're saying it creates a bad culture it's a bad society it's not in keeping with American premises it's not in keeping with American ideals to censor people with whom you disagree sure it's not an issue of the First Amendment perhaps but it is an issue of the cultural products that go with the First Amendment of the American ethos it is an issue of that big government is very bad censorship by big government is bad but big corporation isn't that much better because it's a little bit better because it has usually less of a monopoly but that's you know the corporate culture in America does define our culture in so many ways when a CEO gets run out of town on a rail because he's contravened the the latest leftist orthodoxy the the leftist orthodoxy du jour that's not that's not good that's not something we should celebrate say oh well it's freedom they know it's okay no that's okay they can do it of course they can do it nobody's disagreeing what we're saying should they do it there's a thought that stops thought and that's the only thought that ought to be stopped censorship is bad censorship is bad per se especially in America and when corporations do it we shouldn't just shut down the conversation and say well they can they can hey they can right yeah sure but should they should we hold them accountable and say no don't censor people don't especially when you've got all outsized power especially when you've got the data of all Americans especially if you know where Americans are at all times everywhere and especially when you work with the government when you are constantly in contact with the government all of these big tech firms are fortunately there's some hope in this there are some writers and economists and technologists who are offering hope one of those is George Gilder George Gilder is an American investor economist and author of the international bestseller wealth and poverty which made the case in the early 1980s for supply-side economics and capitalism he was the most often quoted living author by President Ronald Reagan and he now predicts the eventual if not imminent fall of Google and big tech companies in his new book life after Google the fall of big data and the rise of the block economy i sat down with George Gilder a few days ago to discuss why I shouldn't worry too much about Google and why should buy a lot of Bitcoin without further ado here is mister gilder mister gilder thank you so much for being here right to be there so the book is life after Google the fall of Big Data the rise of the blockchain economy you know my show personally has been censored by Google by YouTube I know a lot of people now especially conservatives but across the political spectrum have big gripes with big technology big data give us hope this is a welcome message that there will be a life after Google but why is there gonna be a life after Google why is Google and big tech gonna fall and what comes next because the Internet architecture that that Google and all the big internet leviathans managed has reached the end of the line it doesn't supply security it doesn't supply privacy it can't sustain factuality it really can't ultimately sustain transactions because transactions are necessarily dependent on security so Google's response is to give everything for free and but because who wants to steal free stuff but ultimately on this aggregate and advertised strategy that they're pursuing reaches a dead end you are if you're giving away stuff for free is your dominant model you you're the internet fills up with unwanted value subtracted minuses called ads and the whole system breaks into separate walled gardens of Muller's of Iran have a walled garden government of China which makes perfect sense that too nerds and Google can have their walled garden and and Mark Zuckerberg had his this segmented Internet has reached the end of the line as the essence of it and it's just like IBM you know we everyone thought IBM was the dominant Empire of information technology thirty years ago and the government mobilized regulate it and Sue it just at the point that it that it began to subside into the background of our lives of course and you it's it's funny the IBM example is great because I wonder even if a lot of Millennials watching this show remember how dominant IBM was and then it began to subside and now it seems virtually impossible to think of a world after the dominance of these big tech companies in your book you refer to these Silicon Valley types the heads of Google and Facebook as neo-marxists they have a neo-marxist view of themselves and of the world I think a lot of conservatives suspect that on a gut level but what do you mean by that well the essence of Marxism was Marx's belief that the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century was the final human attainment it it provided productivity beyond any possible needs and in the future the only issue would be how to distribute existing wealth rather than how to create new wealth Google and and itself today believe that they're machine learning their artificial intelligence their robotics their algorithms represent the ultimate human attainment it's their error is even grander than Marx's because Marx didn't imagine that the steam engine could usurp the human mind but Brennan cage imagined that their machine intelligence can usurp and transcend human minds and a grand singularity and you believe that this is foolishness as it was foolishness back then because we hear so much that in the future and then in the not-too-distant future people aren't really going to have to work there's going to be so much abundance from this techno utopia that you people will just don't just get a handout I don't know you can write poetry or something like that you won't really have a work and and you're writing speaks sort of uniquely to the dignity of the human person to the dignity of the individual this sounds like very good news for especially for conservatives but for all of us oh why is it that we don't have to fear the SuperDuper AI singularity running wreaking havoc and and you know surpassing all of human achievement and intelligence it's just so it's just is delusional it's the belief a vast exaggeration of the significance of your own the technology of your own time of your own inventions their computers these big data centers next giant rivers and glaciers around the world that Google's building have nothing to do with human intelligence they have to do with processing huge amounts of data faster than it's ever been processed before in human history and that that data processing that they call machine intelligence is in fact totally dumb it is utterly dependent on human brains at every point of its development and deployment and definition and an application and to the extent that it increases human productivity it will result in more jobs and better jobs and safer jobs and work creative jobs than ever before there's no evidence whatsoever that technology on net has ever destroyed a job and like and that the failure to deploy technology Luddite ISM and and environmental overreach can all destroy jobs but technology cannot and it not only can it not destroy a job but it can't be a conscious mind of course and it's interesting that you bring up the Luddites because I think a lot of the times the political left wants to paint conservatives that we're the Luddites we're resisting change we're the ones who won't adopt new things meanwhile the it is the left that's resurrecting you know stale 19th century political ideology running on socialism in this election it's the left which is relying on these old centralized technologies that seem to be if your if your thesis is right seem to be heading the way of the dodo the subtitle of the book is the fall of Big Data and the rise of the blockchain economy what does that mean does that mean we have to all go out and invest in Bitcoin right now what is the the future of the blockchain economy and what does it mean for for politics and for politics as well as technology the let the black chain is a new architecture for security on the internet that rip rip it starts as a new form of money and unlike cash which affords the anonymity but doesn't give you a record of your transactions this blockchain economy provides you with anonymity you don't have to expose yourself on the screen in order to get a conductive transaction on the Internet but at the same time if some we prosecutor comes after you and claims that you're avoiding taxes or concealing transactions or you can document unimpeachably your your own behavior so it combines anonymity with attestation in a unique way in a major advance for money it also redistributes power today these walled garden is Leviathan segmented internet with porous security allows all the money and power to be sucked up to the top where the only security is supplied the new technology the BOK blockchain is peer to peer and and universal and a boy and put security in your own device and in your own hands with your own content which you can transact with others across the internet without disclosing all your own personal data well you keep using that word that that very few people on the internet for for recent memory have used which is security and now obviously big tech has gotten into a lot of trouble for this they're being hauled before Congress because they've been so loose with their security there have been so many invasions there has been so much theft of data but why is that how is it that these guys Google Facebook that they seemingly ignored security for so long and and how is it that blockchain brings that security back well they they ignore security because because they were giving away all their stuff for free they thought they'd discovered the magical strategy to move beyond capitalism to this new eschaton as Bill Buckley would have called it yeah eminent izing the eschaton is that right imagining that your own era represents the final things the final human solution and and this is this is the Marxist vision and it's the Google vision and it's being transcended by the blockchain which keeps your own data with you and allows you to use it as you choose across the internet rather than depending on on Facebook and Google and it all to tell you who you are and whether you're permitted to proceed further with any action across the net well you I believe I read somewhere that you were the most cited living author by President Ronald Reagan he cited you the most and Ronald Reagan was fond of saying that the government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you have and it seems that the same principle applies to big technology companies we're all so afraid of think of Google and Facebook because they have all of our stuff there they're playing loosey-goosey with it and they can they can really manipulate it and to say nothing of censoring people and targeting up people for unpopular political points of view so this is a really a breath of fresh hope and it's so well written that it's really understandable I do not I am somewhat of a Luddite in that I really don't understand technology and the book is really clearly written it is a must-read life after Google the fall of Big Data and the rise of the blockchain economy the author George Gilder mister gilder thank you so much for being here delighted and thank you for having me all right what a cool guy most quoted it writer by President Ronald Reagan most quoted living writer that's not bad okay I've gotta say goodbye if you're on Facebook and YouTube go to daily wire.com if you're already there thank you very much you helped keep khofifah in my cup we have a ton more to talk about I have to talk about the shocking breaking news story that the mainstream media think that Donald Trump is stupid we'll analyze

worth $100,000 it's worth even more than that that's the that is a leftist tears are worth even more than $100,000 we offered we said Alexandria Alexandria Ocasio Cortes please let us give you $100,000 for your delicious leftist year she said no they're more precious they're more valuable than that think about what and what are we this is like a hundred bucks for an annual membership you get this what a steal that is a discount of orders of magnitude go to daily we're calm we'll be right back all right this is the breaking news story the breaking news story that the mainstream media think Donald Trump is stupid that's what they think he's stupid you know I know this because I was checking my news last night my Apple news on my phone and the big headline the big story is that Donald Trump he people have to explain to Donald Trump what time zones are oh what a fool what a dolt probably doesn't even know what time zones are this is the new story and the the left is running this and they're saying that people close to Donald Trump unnamed anonymous sources but don't worry they're really close to Trump they say that guy he don't even know what time zones are you know Donald Trump who has businesses and property in at least 25 countries around the world has traveled I don't know everywhere in the world and who's present political fake turmoil comes because he regularly traveled to Russia for his in part because of his Miss Universe contest you know you know that the guy who like famously travels all over the world who keeps up one of the busiest travel schedules of anybody he's got meetings in the morning he's going to rallies in Michigan at night that kind of guy yeah he didn't know what time zones are according to the left and I I'm actually surprised that the left still is is going down this path they've been going down this path for a while they say he's so stupid what if that here are the accusations against Trump he doesn't understand time zones does anybody really believe that I know the left is loved to sharing this article the aides close to Trump anonymous that they say he doesn't understand time zones does anybody believe that the evidence by the way is that he calls foreign leaders at whatever time he wants to call them but that doesn't mean he doesn't understand time zones it means that he cares more about his time than Emmanuel macron time it means that he doesn't care yeah oh I'm sorry that the president of who's Becky Becky Becky Stan Stan Stan to quote Herman Cain has to wake up at a bad hour so that the leader of the free world can speak to him oh gosh yeah that means that Donald Trump it just wants to talk to people and by the way part of this part of the allegation here is that he's in constant communication with world leaders we I thought I thought the allegation was that he does he disregards our allies he only wakes up to insult them and you know what no he's clearly in constant communication with them so anyway that's a pretty stupid one the other one they're saying he doesn't know what maps are in this in this article they're saying he doesn't have to explain to him what maps are he doesn't know he doesn't know where countries are on the map and again I don't want to pick on miss Becca Stan but you know to again to quote Herman Cain if you can't pinpoint who's Becky Becky Becky Stan Stan Stan that doesn't mean you're an idiot right it's you could pick out small some of the smaller countries in the world on a map right away you probably couldn't you know where they are you know that they exist you know probably even know some of their geopolitical importance but that's the other one you don't know what maps are then names of countries so we he struggles with the names of countries he can't pronounce them again like okay when all of these comments you know he says they say he doesn't understand foreign alliances and rivalries he doesn't know which countries like one another which are rival whisper one another which are our allies or what everyday okay look around the world right now we are at a time of Greater peace and prosperity around the world then basically at any point in modern presidential history right we've militarily a mostly defeated Isis we've avoided major trade Wars we've avoided major Wars what we've pulled with de-escalated tensions in Syria we're not starting random Wars in Libya were not North Korea seems to be at least at the negotiating table to denuclearize he's pretty good on world affairs so if the argument is he doesn't know anything about world affairs the evidence seems to contradict it then the other one this is another one he only eats fast food New York Times calls him the fast food president he only eats fast food keep barking down that tree that's a great one to bark to first of all he he owns many high-end restaurants the other thing that they said about him was that he only eats steak every night remember that was that that was the stupid news story six months ago is the eat steak and he burns it and puts ketchup on it now they're saying he only it's fast food the other one he spends the whole day watching TV he's just watching Fox and Friends all day when he finishes Fox and Friends in the morning then he starts watching reruns of Fox and Friends probably right isn't that what he does Oh I mean obviously that isn't true but if that were true and he's accomplishing what he's accomplished he's accomplishing the conservative agenda the Heritage Foundation agenda at a faster rate according to Ronald Reagan did then great keep watching TV baby keep it out let's get him a bigger TV maybe he can be even more successful the other one that he spends all day golfing again if he's this effective while golfing keep it up keep keep cutting buddy he doesn't know anything about politics or policy this isn't another canard of the media they say he's not they alternately say he's a white supremacist and that he's not ideological saying he's got the most pernicious extreme ideology and he's not ideological at all doesn't know anything about politics or policy I'm sick of this one because I hear it from conservatives sometimes to this he's not really conservative you know he's not really conservative what do you mean he's not really always he's got the most conservative record of any president in modern history yeah but that's an accident he's not really concerned like he not yeah I know in the real world he's conservative but like secretly deep down really secretly he's not conservative okay right really deep down got it then and then the other one is he's never been good at business you see the mainstream media constantly talk about this he's a really terrible at business I know he succeeded at the highest levels of obviously politics a real-estate casinos to television entertainment right I know he succeeded at the highest levels of that but really secretly in the secret world he's not successful at those yeah I know he has at least a billion dollars but like secretly in the secret world he doesn't have any money you're you're probably richer than he is right in the secret world I'm sure they're all the mainstream media reporters in the secret fantasy world that doesn't exist and only exists on CNN ever and then it's opposite day right okay but but here the facts remain and by the way even with all of that all of these absurd attacks even with Omarosa no I don't know prostituting yourself on television her daily of his daily approval rating is still 50 percent still he's still doing better than Barack Obama day by day in terms of personal popularity and Barack Obama was personally very popular so hahaha before we go I do want to cover this manna fort case so the big headline here was that the manna fort case is wrapping up even though the defense has not mounted has not put Paul Manafort on the stand has not really mounted the defense they're moving straight to their closing arguments to put this in perspective this is basically what the defense's argument is at this point in the trial everything that guy just says bull thank you that's basically it's basically a very fitting to have Paul Manafort have a defense attorney be Joe Pesci so that's what they're saying they're not going to put full Manta Ford on the stand they don't want him to be examined or cross-examined there they're just making their closing arguments right now why is that a few reasons one they might want to have a show of confidence it could be it could be a good strategy for opposite reasons on the one hand they're confident they're going in and they want to look confident at least on the other hand Paul Manafort might be it's arable witness and we don't want they don't want the other side to get a piece of him so either way they're gonna rest it I think another big aspect is they're waiting for a presidential pardon because this is a witch-hunt I'm not saying Paul Manafort didn't commit crimes but this this trial has basically been about a Paul Manafort that likes really expensive suits that's the crime he criminally he was criminally expensive suits and sure he could be laundered money he did this he did that he did things that a lot of lobbyists on both sides of the aisle do why was he brought under scrutiny why was he brought under scrutiny by Bob Muller who was supposed to be investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election why does this have nothing to do with you like why is this it's all because he worked for Donald Trump that was his crime he worked for Donald Trump and so they dug up all this dirt on him and they're they're prosecuting him now he's probably just waiting for a presidential pardon he probably should get it because this has been an egregious miscarriage of justice every step of the way and I say that it knowing that Paul Manafort probably committed crimes then I'm sorry I know I know we're running late what do you want me to do I got to cover how the deputy chairman of the DNC might have beaten ex-girlfriends and nobody's covering this whatsoever in the media the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee may have battered women there are allegations about this and nobody's covering it here here is the latest that Karen Monahan the who is accusing him has now released some texts here are some texts from from couple years ago and this happened from Karen oh this is from Keith Ellison Karen when can I come to drop your stuff off what should I expect from Austin her son he seems pretty upset we talked to on the show yesterday about why he's upset he's alleging that keith Ellison beat his mother then Allison says quote in a text to this ex-girlfriend I'm sorry Austin is feeling this way but I don't know what to do about it it's not appropriate for me to discuss our relationship with him so he's just angry and yet I can't won't offer him any answers later on Monahan says a lot has come to light this past year and a half and the boys have seen some things heard some things that I've tried to explain it's been hard on them and shocking it's taken a lot for me and others to convince them to allow me to handle things in my own way in my own time a lot has happened now from that can we conclude that keith Ellison beat this woman no no we can't conclude that they say that there's a video but that this hasn't been released nobody's seen it yet can we conclude that he's beaten this woman no should we be asking some questions about it yeah of course the main look in election years a lot of stuff comes up even from years past so I'm always skeptical of these accusations what I really just want to point out is the utter hypocrisy from the mainstream media which found doctored evidence a doctored yearbook alleging that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore was prowling for teenage girls when he was 30 and they crucified him with this with with what we know is doctored evidence here we have a woman saying I was beaten by keith ellison and they are shutting her up every bit of reporting says he denied it he's denying no evidence he's denying the utter hypocrisy of people who pretend to be pro-pro me to pro women fighting you know against the the war on women whatever also by the way on this allegation there's another woman who alleges abuse by keith ellison minnesota democrat activist amy alexander said quote i was seduced by the idea of what I thought he Ellison represented as a perennial democratic former labor activists from the north side of Minneapolis I worked for and with Allison on a number of issues and community boards Keith belittled me about my weight and constantly criticized my every word in action he ostracized me from the community on whose behalf I had worked so hard to advocate feeling exiled I escaped to New York for the next five years in May Keith wanted to try and quiet me so he came to my home uninvited we had words his anger kicked in he berated me he grabbed me and pushed me out of the way I was terrified I called the police as he fled he broke my screen door I've never been so scared so now we have a second allegation of physical abuse from the deputy chairman of the DNC I don't know if I made that clear enough who heed this guy is the deputy head of the Democrat Party keith Ellison a second allegation of physical abuse and nobody's covering it nobody will acknowledge it and by the way there there is a record of this 9-1-1 call there is a record of this that she did call this call of 9/11 on Keith Ellison so there is some evidence here and but the left won't cover it will they they won't do it it's funny because Karen Monahan the first accuser is you know she did date keith Ellison so that you do have a certain ideological stripe when you do that and she did say she's turning the identity politics on him she said quote I know who I am I know what I was going through we aren't anywhere in society where I wasn't gonna get smeared as an Iranian as a woman of color who is an immigrant do you honestly think I'm gonna get validation from a society who's been telling me since I was young that I don't have a voice now of course American society does not tell Iranian women that they don't have a voice they do the opposite of that but I do love that she's turning the identity politics on keith ellison that is too delicious not to save her before we go I know I know I'm running late too bad I just want to end on this is America with a terrific video from Chris Pratt Chris take it away thank you guys thank you I'm so thrilled to be here I have not been a teen for quite some time I love you too thank you so much this means a lot to me I know Brice and I both have so much fun being part of the Jurassic Park and Jurassic world franchise I want to thank God I always do that when I'm up on a big platform in front of a bunch of young faces I say I love God that's my thing I love them and you should too I love God what a great what a great moment for the culture we're always complaining about the culture and here you've got the biggest movie star in the world Chris Pratt now this is the second time he's done this in one of these big awards shows in front of a bunch of young kids saying I love God it reminds me of there was this great moment when Pope John Paul the second I'm not comparing Chris Pratt and the Pope but Pope John Paul the second during communism came to Poland and you heard chants you heard shears you heard we want God we want God this popular uprising of calling for God because there's a natural human longing for God and all of our human longings have satisfaction when we're hungry we get food when we're thirsty we have there's water to drink and the natural human longing for God does have a satisfaction in God and it's great to have a guy who is at the center of popular culture just just shouting that from the rooftops at is fantastic so good on you Chris Pratt this is America how American is that to just talk about how we love God well taught well being at the center of Hollywood movies in exporting culture really American culture at its best that's it that's the show sorry I ran late we'll be back no we won't be back tomorrow we're gonna be shown Friday instead so
