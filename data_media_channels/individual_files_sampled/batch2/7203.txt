last night's election results yielded a wave of first and a pretty big progressive shift including the first elected openly transgender person now you're seeing here a picture of Danica Roma who won a pretty big election and won by nearly nine percentage points okay with all precincts reporting she will she put went against Robert Marshall who was a 13 term incumbent okay so this is a huge win for her she out raised Marshall three to one with nearly five hundred thousand dollars in donations much of it coming from LGBT advocates and other supporters across the country and this is a huge point that I want to really really get into because Marshall had a huge anti lgbtq+ history I mean he introduced this anti-trans bathroom bill he actually called himself he called himself chief homophobe okay he calls himself that and throughout the entire election he refused to acknowledge Danica as a woman he refused to use her pronouns he refused to debate her and refer to her as male pronouns like I said the entire time but she came back you know against him super strong she raised all the money her campaign knocked on doors more than 75,000 times in a district with 52,000 registered voters and she went to a bunch of public appearances and interviews and maintained a steady social media presence whereas Marshall didn't do the same and look what happened I mean she won by you know nine percentage points which is a huge huge win and not only a huge win for for her but also I think for the for the transgender community I mean I've been seeing tweets about parents of you know transgender kids who are talking about the importance of representation and seeing you know somebody who can be an elected official being openly transgender and so I think this is a really really huge win for the lgbtq+ community not to mention we also witnessed the first openly trans woman of color Andrea Jenkins who won a seat on the Minneapolis City Council 72% of picked her as the first choice for the City Council position so she won by a landslide now obviously these are the first openly transgender woman to take a seat and the first openly transgender woman of color but there is a history of trailblazers that I want to mention now Stacy Lawton was the first openly transgender woman to win a seat on the state legislature in a 2012 New Hampshire race but she never actually took office now Althea Garrison was a transgender woman who served a term in the Massachusetts state legislature but she did not run as an openly transgender person so there's where the distinction is like I said Tuesday night was a complete night of firsts I'm just gonna run through a few of the first there's a ton of them I'm gonna run through a few of them for you Joyce Craig became the first female mayor of Manchester the largest city in New Hampshire gender Ken was the city's first hour Seattle's first openly lesbian woman to be mayor New Jersey elected its first Sikh mayor on Tuesday night Ravi Bala Wilmot Collins became Montana's first black mayor and Melvin Carter became the first black mayor of st. Paul Minnesota Cathy Tran who is a former Vietnamese refugee became the first Asian American woman to join Virginia's House of Delegates the list goes on and on I mean I had a huge stack of papers talking about all the first that were accomplished last night and this is amazing because we are seeing this huge progressive shift and this is the retaliation this is the resistance in the Trump era yeah Virginia is for lovers haters back off like that I mean that's what the for one you led with is a story of just epic proportions when you start unpacking it you have a 13 term incumbent in races like this it is so the incumbent moniker is one that is so difficult to take from someone it is so it's nearly impossible I don't know what it is lately but like for years and years it's like a 90% incumbent success rate across the board especially in smaller lower you know profile races so that was amazing and and this a lot of them are taking place in Virginia so you have the president or the the governor of Virginia and it goes all the way down it was that down ballot voting at work so all the stuff everyone was saying about turnout the vote go to the polls and remember remember to vote down ballot that paid off huge yeah I think it is is as much as it is exciting it is kind of like interesting that in America this bastion of diversity and meritocracy that we have so many firsts like this that's like what these are the first black mayors that we've had these are the first in City you know so it's exciting it's it's interesting it's a referendum on on trump and trumpism as it's been labeled but I also think folks are electing folks who respond to the local issues right so while you have these incumbents who are playing identity politics who are centering this trans woman's identity she's responding to the issues that the voters are responding to and I think that is what wins and I think that's what the larger Democratic Party can learn from this election in particular is you need to speak to you know the constituents yeah I think that's a really really good point because I feel like conservatives often say that you know liberals and Democrats are always playing sort of identity politics and kind of claiming that and he was the one and Marshall was the one in this case who was attacking you know they put how ads attacking her on being transgender and saying wait she's not really a woman what is her birth certificate say and all these sorts of things and she's like well and she put out sort of a counter ad saying yeah I take hormone pills like this is who I am but we're all humans at the end of the day and I think you know in this day and age being human and having sort of that underlying message of empathy is something that is you know clearly by last night something that is really important and something that's really resonating with people who may be turned off by this sort of trumpism and realize that you do need to go out and cuz bad things can happen and if you ask Danica she is she says like I didn't like the traffic problem that's what issues yeah and and everyone everyone in the area was yeah it takes two hours to get to work and that is local politics and you have a traffic problem I commute to work was disturbed by a slight repainting of the lines and there are all along like replace Bonin you hate the traffic replace Councilman Bonin and so that is that is exactly the kind of stuff and an amazing way to go at handling two huge things one the identity politics concept that everyone's talking about Bailey and and and you had an in Qatar teen term incumbent who said it's I it's enough for me just to say that this person is a freak and this is my job right and Danica said very tactfully very effectively like okay I am this person this is Who I am let's fix the traffic yeah she ran on traffic and and Medicaid expansion I mean that's amazing yeah and I think in in this particular instance when you you mentioned these of these former candidates who were also trans women we're not out right they weren't openly trans they were outed right so then you have someone who is openly trans right and then her identity is still centered so it's like there's no way around the identity politics being done so she's like let's let's galvanize people around these issues right which is what we should be talking about yeah yeah I think it's important that all these issues were brought up I also think like I'll mention again that that at the core of this I think representation is huge right when little kids can see that elect officials regardless of whether they're facing any sort of bigotry or I mean you know trans children have like the highest suicide rate and things like that seeing somebody sort of sidestep essentially all that sort of hateful rhetoric and bigotry and you know unseat this incumbent is huge and and not to mention congratulations obviously to all of the other you know winters last night right there's also some there's some sad but true things that are still at work that luckily went in the the favor of the Democratic candidate the fact that she was able to out raise three to one and have three to one that kind of money to spend that doesn't happen all the time like I still think the focus should be to try to get money out of politics but but and but it was important for people to in a in this system that we have go and find ways to donate to the candidates that you think can make a difference I think that's important I will point out enough the the referendum in Maine is really really important that was a referendum on Medicaid expansion so far there had been kind of like a buffer between polls where you hear people say like yes please expand Medicaid we want more people to have access to health care and then a bunch of legislative hurdles and this weird actually we have a you know gerrymandered districts which lead to Republican legislators or a Republican governor who's able to have a better campaign and get the governorship but we had a situation here where people said no here is a vote rainy to have Medicaid expansion and the governor's still given them crap about it saying he's not gonna make it happen until they until they can fund it but this is one of those things where people are going to the polls and saying we want this make it happen yeah and that's huge right people going to the polls and making like first of all voting in general right and being informed and voting all that stuff is is so so important but there's so many of these stories to where you hear of you know somebody was upset by a comment one of their lawmakers made or they witnessed something and so then they decided to run themselves and I think that's important too for all of the young people who are watching too one vote but to like you have the power to to run and make a change yourself and I think that is a huge movement that we're seeing with young people with progressives and so I'm happy that we saw it in this election and I'd like to see it in elections to come if you like The Young Turks you love Young Turks membership TYT Network comm
