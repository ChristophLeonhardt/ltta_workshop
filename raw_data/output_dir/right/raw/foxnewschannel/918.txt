1
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:12,791
>> Martha: SO, TO TRUMP OR NOT

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,926
TO TRUMP?

3
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:15,394
THAT'S A QUESTION FOR SOME

4
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:16,662
G.O.P. CANDIDATES OUT THERE.

5
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:17,996
>> IT'S NOT THE PLACE FOR ANY

6
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:21,967
PARTY TO END UP WITH A CULTLIKE

7
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:26,372
SITUATION AS IT RELATES TO A

8
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:29,608
PRESIDENT WHO HAPPENS TO BE

9
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:30,943
PURPORTEDLY OF THE SAME PARTY.

10
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:32,744
>> LIKE MY OPPONENT SAID LAST

11
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:34,747
NIGHT, HER WORDS WERE, THIS IS

12
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:35,948
THE PARTY OF DONALD J. TRUMP.

13
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,817
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THE PARTY

14
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:39,818
OF DONALD J. TRUMP.

15
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:40,586
>> Martha: 'S OF NOT

16
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:42,187
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT DID NOT

17
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:43,655
END UP WORKING WELL FOR MARK

18
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:45,991
SANFORD WHO YOU SAW HERE LAST

19
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:46,759
NIGHT, BUT SUPPORTING

20
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,626
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WORKING WELL

21
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:50,996
FOR SOME OTHERS INCLUDING OUR

22
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:53,465
NEXT GUEST, COREY STEWART.

23
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,601
HE HAS GOTTEN LOTS OF ATTENTION

24
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:59,071
FOR THIS CONTENTIOUS INTERVIEW

25
00:00:59,204 --> 00:00:59,872
VIRGINIA SENATE PRIMARY.

26
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:02,741
>> I DON'T AGREE WITH ANY OF

27
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:04,810
THOSE THINGS THAT YOU SAID.

28
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,145
THE THING IS -- THEY ARE ALL

29
00:01:06,145 --> 00:01:06,945
TRUE.

30
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:08,280
YOU ARE TRYING TO DENY YOUR PAST

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,616
BUT THEY ARE LIKE A BIG UGLY

32
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:10,949
SHADOW.

33
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:20,125
>> YOUR TRYING TO CHANGE THE

34
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:20,459
SUBJECT.

35
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,594
>> Martha: VERY GOOD TO HAVE

36
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:23,729
YOU HERE TONIGHT.

37
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,365
>> MY PLEASURE, THANKS MARTHA.

38
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:27,533
>> Martha: SO THE SUBJECT YOU

00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,902
ARE ARGUING LAST NIGHT AT CNN IS

40
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,770
GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME UP.

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,372
WHEN YOU HAVE DEBATES, WHEN YOU

42
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:35,340
ARE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,074
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE YOU

44
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:39,478
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURSL

45
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:39,711

46
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:39,745

00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:40,045
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH      YOURSN

50
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:41,380
THE PAST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT

51
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,782
IN THE DAILY WIRE AND THE DAILY

52
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:44,149
STANDARD.

53
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:45,617
PAUL KNEELAND AS ONE OF THE

54
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:48,654
NAMES IN THERE AND HE HAS BEEN

55
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:49,388
HARSHLY CRITICIZED FOR

56
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:49,822
ANTI-SEMITISM.

57
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:52,424
HE ONCE CALLED HIM A HERO AND

58
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:53,959
SAID YOU WERE INSPIRED BY HIM.

59
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,494
YOU DISCOUNT THAT, DO YOU REJECT

60
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:57,529
THAT?

61
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:58,931
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO THAT?

62
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:01,700
>> YES, ACTUALLY I HAVE MANY

63
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,037
TIMES.

64
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,139
IS WHEN PHYLLIS SCHAAF LAY DEAD

65
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,574
AND NAN COULTER DID AND

66
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,343
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AS WELL, HE

67
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:12,945
SAID VERY NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM.

68
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,947
IT WAS ONLY AFTER THAT HE LOST

69
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:17,149
HIS MARBLES AND SAID TERRIBLE

70
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:17,549
THINGS.

71
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,352
THEN WE KIND OF ALL DISTANCE

72
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:21,620
OURSELVES FROM HIM.

73
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,356
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR CNN

74
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:26,325
AND A LEFT-WING MEDIA, THEY ARE

75
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,559
TRYING TO CONNECT US TO ALL

76
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,160
THAT.

77
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,995
THE REASON THEY ARE AS THEY ARE

78
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:31,630
TRYING TO DISTRACT FROM THE MAIN

79
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,365
MESSAGE WHICH IS PRESIDENT TRUMP

80
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:35,067
IS STRONG, GETTING STRONGER, AND

81
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:39,204
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TIED

82
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,439
OURSELVES TO HIM AND VOWED TO

83
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,841
SUPPORT HIS POLICIES ARE WINNING

84
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,542
SUPPORT HIS POLICIES ARE WINNIN

85
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:43,942
WINNING.

86
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:45,177
AND WE WILL INCREASINGLY WIN AS

87
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:48,146
WE GET CLOSER TO NOVEMBER.

88
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:50,449
BY THAT POINT, WE WILL HAVE A

89
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:52,985
RED TIDE BECAUSE OF THE

90
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:53,785
POPULARITY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.

91
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:55,254
>> Martha: YOU MAY BE RIGHT

92
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:57,055
ABOUT THAT.

93
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,758
ONE MORE QUESTION, BECAUSE PAUL

94
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:04,563
KNEELAND, YOU ARE RIGHT, IT WAS

95
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,397
REVEALED AFTER YOU SAID THOSE

96
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:09,301
THINGS THAT HE HAD ANTI-SEMITIC

97
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:09,668
COMMENTS.

98
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:14,339
HOWEVER HE HAD REVEALED THAT --

99
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,541
>> NOT AT ALL.

100
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,543
NOT EVERY PERSON YOU MEET WITH,

101
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:18,877
AND YOU MEET A LOT OF THEM IN

102
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:19,244
POLITICS.

103
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:20,546
YOU DON'T DO A BACKGROUND CHECK

104
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:21,680
ON EVERYBODY AND I CERTAINLY

105
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,750
WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THAT.

106
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,984
I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP

107
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:26,685
WITH THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND

108
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:29,555
THE COMMUNITY ARE SERVED RIGHT

109
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:29,821
NOW.

110
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:31,757
>> Martha: SO IN TERMS OF THE

111
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:33,458
TRUMP CAMPAIGN, YOU ARE INVOLVED

112
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,028
IN THE TRUCK CAMPAIGN, FIRED IN

113
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:36,828
2016 BUT NOW THE PRESIDENT IS

114
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,932
SUPPORTIVE OF YOU.

115
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:41,633
YOU WROTE       HE WROTE A VERYN

116
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:41,667

118
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,235
STATEMENT ABOUT YOU AND YOU HAVE

119
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:45,037
MADE IT CLEAR THAT YOU WANT TO

120
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:45,771
BE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH HIM AS

121
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:49,141
YOU MOVE FORWARD IN THIS

122
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:49,675
CAMPAIGN, CORRECT?

123
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:51,543
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

124
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,545
HE'S HAD A TREMENDOUS STRING OF

125
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:54,546
SUCCESSES HERE.

126
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,648
THE TAX CUT WHICH HAS LED -- AND

127
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:58,483
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT, I'M

128
00:03:58,483 --> 00:03:59,384
TELLING YOU.

129
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:02,454
YOU CAN SEE THE RESURGENCE IN

130
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,423
MANUFACTURING IN PARTICULAR, IN

131
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,457
VIRGINIA, SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND

132
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:05,991
AROUND THE STATE.

133
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:07,893
AND NOW WITH THIS LATEST SUCCESS

134
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:10,295
IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA FOR THE

135
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:12,931
FIRST TIME, WE HAVE PEACE

136
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,733
BREAKING OUT.

137
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,401
SINCE 1950 IN THE KOREAN

138
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,101
PENINSULA, AND YOU CAN'T ARGUE

139
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:19,738
WITH THAT SUCCESS.

140
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,473
>> Martha: YOU WILL RUN

141
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:22,774
AGAINST TIM KAINE IN THE STATE

142
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:23,542
OF VIRGINIA AND THAT WILL BE A

143
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,212
VERY TOUGH RACE, IT'S ALWAYS A

144
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:28,947
TIGHT RACE IN VIRGINIA.

145
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,349
VERY QUICKLY BEFORE YOU GO,

146
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:31,950
WHAT'S YOUR MAIN STRATEGY, WHAT

147
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,153
DO YOU THINK HAS WEAKNESSES?

148
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,189
>> HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

149
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,757
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR SIX

150
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:41,159
YEARS AND HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED

151
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,994
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

152
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:43,261
NOT A SINGLE ACCOMPLISHMENT IN

153
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,196
THE PAST SIX YEARS.

154
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,231
THE ONLY THING HE HAS DONE IS

155
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:47,065
RUN FOR VICE PRESIDENT AND HE

156
00:04:47,065 --> 00:00:00,000
DIDN'T EVEN DO A GOOD JOB AT
