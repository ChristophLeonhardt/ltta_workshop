<font color="#E5E5E5">release his tax returns because he's</font>

under audit is absolute nonsense a whole

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,040
I've said it but let's take him at his

word you can't release your tax returns

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,300
tax returns from 1978 the first year he

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,750
paid zero income taxes through 2008 when

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,830
by his own account the audits are closed

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,050
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no reason not to</font>

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,210
release those returns now we know as a

matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fact from other various</font>

government reports that I have dug out

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,079
the Trump paid no income taxes in 1978

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,899
1979 he didn't pay income taxes in 92

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,739
and 94 and I earlier this year revealed

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,070
that he did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not pay income taxes in 1984</font>

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,410
which was a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> year for him that was</font>

21
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,960
the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he opened up Trump Tower</font>

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,690
and sold apartments in space and rented

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,670
units and it was the year his first

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,039
casino<font color="#E5E5E5"> opened in Atlantic City ahead of</font>

still ordered his<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-time tax guy a</font>

tax returns<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mitnick under oath was shown</font>

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,409
the only tax return the government had

38
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,869
apparently the one filed was a photocopy

39
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,360
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mitnick looked at this document and</font>

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,509
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's my signature on the</font>

41
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,970
tax return but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't prepare that tax</font>

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,240
you're ever going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get of tax fraud</font>

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,850
that is a badge of tax fraud so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

45
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,590
there's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reason to believe he's</font>

46
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,630
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged in tax fraud in addition</font>

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,630
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is currently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on a new york</font>

state private attorney general action in

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,649
which a quarter billion dollar tax fraud

50
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,980
is alleged now Trump is only a<font color="#E5E5E5"> materi</font>

51
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,989
witness in that case so there's abundant

52
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:17,390
evidence here of big problems now an

53
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,769
obvious question people may ask

54
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:19,879
themselves as well why hasn't even

55
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,310
prosecuted we don't prosecute hardly

56
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,989
anybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this country for tax fraud if</font>

57
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,150
we had Donald Trump's tax returns I

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,500
think we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> find that he's probably</font>

59
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,530
paid penalties in the past and that the

60
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">government as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it often does when faced</font>

61
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,010
with threats of extended litigation over

62
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,290
tax matters and refusal to produce

63
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,959
documents has settled with him for a

64
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,450
discount this is a really aggressive

65
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,690
taxpayer strategy that's used a lot so

66
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,250
that people get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with paying less</font>

67
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,470
than they oh and if we had his tax

68
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,690
returns and audit notices we would know

69
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,879
the truth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I'm guarantee you</font>

70
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,099
one thing we are never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

71
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,109
Donald Trump's tax returns even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>
