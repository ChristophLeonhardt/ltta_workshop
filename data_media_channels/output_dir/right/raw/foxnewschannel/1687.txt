MEGHAN WANTS HER DAD TO WALK

00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:23,947
HER DOWN THE AISLE.

13
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:25,115
FIRST SAYING HE WOULD, THEN

14
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:26,983
DECIDING HE WOULDN'T IN THE

00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,652

PART OF HISTORY.

21
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:37,060
THAT'S A QUOTE.

22
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,629

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,943
BLAMED THE TABLOID PRESS FOR

30
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:54,844

34
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:10,026
HIM TO CALL OFF MARRYING MEGHAN.

35
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,428
IT CAUSED SOME BRIT TO ROLL

36
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:13,063
THEIR EYES AS THE AMERICAN

37
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:18,768
REALITY SHOW NATURE OF THE

38
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:19,369

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,237
THEY HOPE THEY CAN RISE ABOVE

40
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:22,639
THE PAST BEHAVIOR OF THEIR

41
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:23,139
PARENTS.

42
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:26,209
MY MOM SAYS, THE ARBITER OF ALL

43
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,243
THINGS ROYAL, SHE JUST WANTS

44
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:29,045
HARRY TO BE HAPPY.

45
00:01:29,045 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S THE FINAL WORD FROM MOM.
