1
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:12,462
>> Tucker: OVER TIME,

2
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:13,796
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADING

3
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,532
INDICATOR OF WHAT THE REST OF

4
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:16,199
THE COUNTRY BECOMES.

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,636
LET'S HOPE THAT IS NO LONGER

6
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:19,936
TRUE.

7
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,805
CALIFORNIA HAS NOW RUN FOR

8
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:25,208
POVERTY, HUMAN WASTE PILING UP

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,309
ABUNDANT SIDEWALKS, BANKRUPT

10
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,344
GOVERNMENT, AND VANISHING

11
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:32,415
MIDDLE-CLASS.

12
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,983
AND AT THE STATE DOESN'T SPEAK

13
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:34,784
ENGLISH AT HOME.

14
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,220
IT CAN CALIFORNIA BE SAVED OR IS

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,421
IT TOO LATE?

16
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:40,990
JOHN COX DOESN'T THINK IT'S TOO

17
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,091
LATE, HE WILL BE FACING GAVIN

18
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,227
NEWSOM IN NOVEMBER AND HE JOINS

19
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,228
US TONIGHT.

20
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:46,462
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

21
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:48,631
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

22
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,401
YOU GREW UP IN CALIFORNIA, YOU

23
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,702
LIVE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM.

24
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,671
NOW THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IS TO

25
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,640
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO GET TO TEXAS.

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,242
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT.

27
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:01,644
GAVIN NEWSOM WOULD RUN THIS

28
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,246
STATE EVEN FURTHER INTO THE

29
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:03,580
GROUND.

30
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,781
>> Tucker: SO WHAT WOULD

31
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:05,582
YOU -- AND IT'S SAD TO EVEN

32
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:08,351
REPORT ON IT BUT IT IS THE

33
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,686
BIGGEST STATE.

34
00:01:09,686 --> 00:01:11,221
THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS IN

35
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,422
CALIFORNIA, WE COULD GO ON FOR

36
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:13,623
THE REST OF THE WEEK.

37
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:14,357
BUT IF YOU WERE TOO NARROW IT

38
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:15,825
DOWN TO ONE THING YOU CAN CHANGE

39
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,627
ABOUT THE STATE TO GIVE THE

40
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:18,828
MIDDLE CLASS FROM FLEEING, TO

41
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,197
KEEP THE STATE FROM GOING

42
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,299
BANKRUPT, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

43
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,402
>> I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT'S THE

44
00:01:26,402 --> 00:01:27,403
TAX BURDEN PRIMARILY.

45
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:30,807
THE GAS TAX WILL BE REALLY A

46
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:31,407
PROBLEM HERE.

47
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:34,077
A STATE SENATOR JOSH NEWMAN WAS

48
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:38,047
JUST RECALLED YESTERDAY BY 60%.

49
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:39,315
THEY SPENT $8 MILLION OF SPECIAL

50
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:41,050
INTEREST MONEY TO TRY TO KEEP

51
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,021
THIS GUY AND OFFICE AND THE

52
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:45,655
VOTERS TURNED IT OUT.

53
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:48,424
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN THAT THE

54
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:50,560
VOTERS HERE ARE GETTING IT.

55
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,862
THIS ELECTION WILL PROVIDE A

56
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,030
STARK CONTRAST.

57
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,465
GAVIN NEWSOM TALKED ABOUT IT,

58
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:59,402
AND HE WANTS TO HAVE A CRADLE TO

59
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:00,803
COLLEGE NANNY STATE GOVERNMENT,

60
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:04,240
AS IF THIS GOVERNMENT ISN'T BIG

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,208
ENOUGH.

62
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,809
OR TAXING US ENOUGH.

63
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,645
HE WANTS TO EXPAND THAT.

64
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,446
HE WANTS TO DOUBLE THE INCOME

65
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,081
TAX, HE WANTS TO INCREASE

66
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:13,283
PROPERTY TAXES AND HE WANTS TO

67
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:16,252
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT REPEAL

68
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:16,853
THIS GAS TAX.

69
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,921
I SAY THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE

70
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,657
HAVE BEEN TAXED ENOUGH.

71
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:24,027
THEY ARE GOING TO REBEL AND WE

72
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:28,064
WILL LEAVE THAT REVOLT.

73
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,866
>> Tucker: I DON'T THINK THEY

74
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:31,267
COULD EVER REPAY THAT MONEY,

75
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,902
IT'S TOO MUCH.

76
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,805
AND NOW THEY ARE PROPOSING TO

77
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,607
GIVE FREE MEDICAID TO ILLEGAL

78
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:38,007
IMMIGRANTS.

79
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,043
SO HOW WILL THE STATE EVER

80
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:44,213
AFFORD THAT, OR ANY OF THIS?

81
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,149
WHAT IS THE PLAN GOING FORWARD?

82
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:47,617
>> I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE

83
00:02:47,617 --> 00:02:49,085
COULD GROW OUR WAY OUT OF IT BUT

84
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,653
I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT'S

85
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:51,854
AVAILABLE TO US.

86
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:54,257
WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME REALLY

87
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,658
STARK, CLEAR CONVERSATIONS WITH

88
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,628
A LOT OF THESE EMPLOYEE UNIONS.

89
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:00,063
AS USUAL, IT'S THE EMPLOYEES WHO

90
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:02,665
ARE GOOD, THEY TAKE THE PIPE ON

91
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:02,965
THIS.

92
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,101
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, TUCKER, THEY

93
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,270
HAVEN'T EVEN BEGUN TO PUT ANY

94
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,038
MONEY AWAY FROM RETIREE

95
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,073
HEALTH CARE, AND THERE ARE ALL

96
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:11,040
KINDS OF STATE WORKERS THAT ARE

97
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,011
RETIRING AT 53 OR 54 YEARS OLD.

98
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,012
THEY'VE BEEN PROMISED

99
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,213
HEALTH CARE UNTIL THEY QUALIFY

100
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,615
FOR MEDICARE, AND AS THEY KNOW,

101
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,417
MEDICARE IS GOING BROKE AT THE

102
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:22,418
FEDERAL LEVEL.

103
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,620
THE BIG PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY IS

104
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,656
THAT CALIFORNIA CAN'T PRINT

105
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:29,192
MONEY, AND ITS CREDIT RATING IS

106
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:32,195
HANGING BY A THREAD.

107
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:34,630
I AM A CPA, THAT WAS MY FIRST

108
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,031
DEGREE.

109
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,666
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I HAVE

110
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,301
TO LEVEL WITH THE PEOPLE OF THIS

111
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,503
STATE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH

112
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:41,337
THE UNFUNDED DEBT.

113
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:41,971
>> Tucker: I CAN'T IMAGINE

114
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,640
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE A

115
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,842
CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT IN

116
00:03:45,842 --> 00:00:00,000
CALIFORNIA, TO BE A MATH GUY AND
