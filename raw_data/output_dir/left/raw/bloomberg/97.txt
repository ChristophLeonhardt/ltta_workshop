1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,000
Xi Jinping is the most powerful Chinese president
in decades.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,740
And he has many faces:

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,120
Tough-guy Xi cracks down on corruption.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,580
Statesman Xi fights for free trade.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,149
Nationalist Xi reclaims land in the South
China Sea.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,630
Visionary Xi aims to make China a great global
power.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,270
Here’s how a boy who was sent to the countryside
to shovel sewage and feed pigs reached the

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,750
pinnacle of power.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,770
Xi was born in Beijing in 1953.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,770
His father Xi Zhongxun was a communist revolutionary
leader and China's propaganda chief, who rose

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,650
to become a vice premier... before being purged
in Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,860
At the age of 15 Xi too was affected by the
Cultural Revolution.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,780
He was sent to a rural village in northwestern
China where he lived in a cave house dug into

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,780
a hillside.

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,850
“He was feeding pigs.

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,940
You know, he was like cleaning toilets.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,980
He was doing farming.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,620
You know in his spare time, he would read
books.

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,540
That’s Bloomberg Senior Government Reporter Ting Shi

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,130
"I cover China’s politics and foreign relations.”

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,720
While living in the countryside he became
a voracious reader, picking up everything

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,200
from Victor Hugo to Ernest Hemingway

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
“He took one of his all-time favorite books

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,140
with him, that is Karl Marx magnum opus 'Das
Kapital', he read it three times over seven years.”

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,560
In 1975, Xi was allowed to return to Beijing
where he studied chemical engineering, but

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,170
his work as a Communist Party member prevailed.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,320
Xi rose through the party ranks in the rapidly
industrializing coastal provinces of Fujian

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,690
and Zhejiang.

29
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,600
His big break came in 2007 with his promotion
to top leader of Shanghai.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,200
The job aided Xi's ascension to the party's
all-powerful Standing Committee, setting him

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,800
up to succeed Hu Jintao as Party Leader, Commander
in Chief and President.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,080
By 2013, the transformation was complete.

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,119
Xi was China's paramount leader.

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,509
“There was nothing obvious in the early
part of his career to suggest he would become

35
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:08,020
one of China’s most powerful leaders ever.

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,060
Having taken power, Xi has demonstrated his
flair for hands-on management and strict Communist

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,359
Party discipline.

38
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:17,799
He's launched a Mao-style
campaign to tighten up controls on ideology,

39
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:21,659
media, and dissent by arresting journalists
and activists.

40
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:29,049
“And he has been overseeing probably the
harshest crackdown on activism and human rights

41
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,930
groups in the party’s recent history.”

42
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,980
In addition, Xi has pledged a blizzard of economic
reforms and ordered the biggest military overhaul

43
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,609
since the 1950’s.

44
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:46,340
He has this great belief China totally deserves
to restore its place in the world.

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,470
“Chinese Dream” is the phrase he coined
to convey this message.

46
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,400
While Xi is seen as an able leader at home,
he's only starting to establish China's new

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,340
power on the world stage.

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,480
And President Donald
Trump has accused Xi of failing to curb the

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,699
nuclear ambitions of North Korea.

50
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:09,309
“So far he doesn’t seem to be able to
give up on North Korea because the fear about

51
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:13,829
collapse of North Korea and the consequences
of that.”

52
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:19,189
But Xi is the first Chinese president not
to visit North Korea and has argued China

53
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,799
isn’t responsible for them.

54
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,109
And despite their disagreements over North
Korea and trade, Xi and U.S. President Donald

55
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:26,579
Trump hit it off.

56
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,250
“When he was in Mar-a-Largo on his first
visit to the U.S. he seems to be totally in

57
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
his element!

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:39,510
He was telling Trump about the history of
the Korean peninsula and Trump was rolling out

59
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,000
his grandchildren to sing a Chinese song for
Xi Jinping.”

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,089
Just how long their warm rapport will last
remains to be seen.

61
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:52,780
Back home, Xi will complete his consolidation
of power with a party congress in Beijing

62
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,269
in October 2017, when roughly half of China's
top officials will be replaced.

63
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,879
The questions now, are will he use that power
to force through reforms needed to revamp

64
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,189
the economy?

65
00:04:04,189 --> 00:00:00,000
And will China emerge to rival the U.S. as
the world's No.1 superpower?
