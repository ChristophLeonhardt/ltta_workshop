>>> WE JUST HEARD FROM JIM
JORDON.
MY NEXT GUEST IS FROM THE HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
KEY PLAYERS OF THE FBI RUSSIA
PROBE AS WELL AS THE DOSSIER.
THE RESEARCH FIRM FUSION GBS
HELPED ASSEMBLE THE DOSSIER
HELPED THE PANEL.
HE'S REJECTING THE SUBPOENA.
HE SAID HE'LL TAKE THE FIFTH.
THE GENERAL COUNCIL JAMES BAKER
WILL TESTIFY ON THURSDAY OF THIS
WEEK.
NELLI OHR WORKED FOR THEM AND
PLANS TO TESTIFY.
I HAVE JOHN RATCLIFF.
HE'S A FORMER FEDERAL
PROSECUTOR.
CONGRESSMAN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> GOOD MORNING, MARIA.
>> WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE
UPCOMING WEEK?
>> WE DID SUBPOENA GLENN SIMPSON
THE FUSION GPS COFOUNDER.
THE PERSON THAT COMMISSIONED THE
STEEL DOSSIER PAID FOR BY
HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DNC.
HE INDICATED HE PLANS TO TAKE
THE FIFTH OR ASSERT HIS FIFTH
AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
GLENN PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED HE
NEVER MET WITH BRUCE OHR OR
DISCUSSED THE STEEL DOSSIER
PRIOR TO THE OCTOBER FISA
APPLICATION IN 2016 OR THE 2016
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
THAT'S IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION
TO WHAT HE TOLD ME UNDER OATH
LAST MONTH.
I'M NOT SURPRISED HE IS TAKING
THE FIFTH.
HE'S IN REAL LEGAL JEOPARDY.
NELLI OHR, BRUCE'S WIFE, CAN
SHED SOME LIGHT.
WE NEED TO FIND OUT FROM HER WHO
WAS PAID $35,000 FOR HER WORK
INCLUDING IF WORK ON THE STEEL
DOSSIER, WHY THAT FACT, THE WIFE
OF THE NUMBER FOUR PERSON OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD
OPERATIONAL ROLES IN RESPECT TO
THE STEEL DOSSIER WASN'T
DISCLOSED BY THEM.
>> WHERE IS THE CRIME?
IS IT HER HUSBAND OR HER?
SHE DID THE RESEARCH THAT WAS
NEVER VERIFIED ON DONALD TRUMP
APPEARED PUT IT IN THE DOSSIER
AND PUT IT ON A THUMB DRIVE AND
GAVE IT TO HER HUSBAND WHO
WASN'T WORKING ON ANYTHING
ABOUTTRUM BE AT THE TIME.
>> THE QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO
THE FISA COURT AND
REPRESENTATIONS MADE.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING THE
WARRANT TO SPY ON AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN.
IF THAT WAS DONE ON FALSE
PRETENSES WITH FALSE INFORMATION
THAT'S VIOLATING SOMEONES CIVIL
LIBERTIES UNDER COLOR OF LAW.
SO, THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TALK
TO NELLI OHR AND OTHERS TO
DETERMINE WHAT THE FBI KNEW,
WHEN THEY KNEW IT.
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
KNEW AND WHY THEY KNEW IT.
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS A
GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE FBI AND
DOJ THAT DIDN'T LIKE DONALD
TRUMP.
THEY DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE
PRESIDENT.
THEY TRIED TO STOP HIM.
>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S A FAIR
SUMMERY.
THE SAME FOLKS THAT PREJUDGED
HILLARY CLINTON'S INNOCENCE AND
PREJUDGED DONALD TRUMP'S GUILTY
ARE THE SAME NAMES AND FOLKS
WHO'S CONDUCT BE IN ISSUE OF
RESPECT TO HOW EVIDENCE WAS
PRESENTED OR NOT PRESENTED TO
THE COURT.
>> YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT IS
THAT SOMEBODY WHO GAVE THE GREEN
LIGHT ON THE WARRANT BASED ON
THE UNVERIFIED INFORMATION.
THE SAME GUY WHO, WROTE A LETTER
TO HAVE JIM COMBY FIRE AND UPSET
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED HE WROTE
THE LETTER TO GET COMBY FIRED.
THE SAME GUY RUNNING THE DOJ
TODAY SITTING ON DOCUMENTS THAT
YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE
BEEN ASKING FOR.
THIS IS THE SAME INDIVIDUAL
OVERSEEING THE ROBERT MUELLER
INVESTIGATION?
>> THE REASON FOR THAT, MARIA,
IS JEFF SESSIONS HASN'T POINTED
ASPECIAL -- A SPECIAL COUNCIL.
THINK ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCE YOU JUST DESCRIBED.
THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE ROD ROSENSTEIN IN DIRECT
CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER.
EACH ACCUSING ONE ANOTHER OF NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH IN REGARDS TO
IF SOMEONE WANTED TO RECORD THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A SPECIAL
COUNCIL PROVISION.
THEY CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO
INVESTIGATE THE MATTER WHEN THE
HEADS OF BOTH OF THOSE
COMPONENTS ARE IN DIRECT
CONFLICT.
THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIAL
COUNCIL SO WE CAN GET ANSWERS TO
THE QUESTIONS.
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF STRATEGY
GOING ON.
THERE WAS A MEDIA LEAK STRATEGY.
LET'S LEAK STUFF TO THE MEDIA SO
THEY COULD START TALKING ABOUT
IT AND THEY DID.
THERE WERE INFORMANTS INVOLVED.
THERE WAS A STRATEGY TO TAKE
DONALD TRUMP DOWN.
WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT
DECLASSIFY THE DOCUMENTS SO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN CLEARLY
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED HERE
RATHER THEN HAVING A HINT OF
DONALD TRUMP HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH IT?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION FOR
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
HERE IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU.
ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS THEY ARE
SEEKING -- SEEKING TO DECLASSIFY
I HAVE SEEN THEM.
I CAN TELL YOU AS A FORMER
FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IT WOULDN'T
EXPOSE NATIONAL SECURITY
INFORMATION.
IT WOULD EXPOSE CERTAIN FOLKS AT
THE OBAMA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND
FBI AND THEIR ACTIONS AND
ACTIONS TAKEN TO CONCEAL CERTAIN
INFORMATION.
THE UNDERLINE PRETEXT TO THE
ENTIRE TRUMP/RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION IS THE IDEA THAT
GEORGE HAD A MEETING WITH A
DIPLOMAT ABOUT GETTING E-MAILS
FROM THE RUSSIAN.
IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR
FBI HAS ANOTHER PEACE
FBI HAS ANOTHER PIECE OF
EVIDENCE THAT GOES AGAINST THAT
THEY WOULD PRESENT BOTH SIDES OF
THE COIN TO EVALUATE THE WEIGHT
AND SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE.
INSTEAD, WHAT HAPPENED HERE, THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FBI
OFFICIALS IN OCTOBER OF 2016
ONLY PRESENTED TO THE COURT THE
EVIDENCE THAT MADE THE
GOVERNMENT'S CASE GET A WARRANT
TO SPY ON A TRUMP CAMPAIGN
ASSOCIATE.
DECLASSIFICATION WOULD
CORROBORATE WHAT I JUST RELATED
TO YOU.
>>Reporter: HOW IS THAT
INVESTIGATION HAVING ANY
CREDIBILITY IF HE'S NOT ACTUALLY
LOOKING AT WHO DID COLLUDE OR
WORK WITH THE RUSSIAN?
>> THAT ISSUE, I WOULD ADVOCATE
FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL
COUNCIL TO LOOK AT TEASE
COUNCIL TO LOOK AT TEASISH --
THESE ISSUES.
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS GOING.
>> WHERE IT'S GOING IS IT'S
WINDING DOWN.
I'VE WATCHED CLOSELY WHAT'S BEEN
HAPPENING.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE OFFICE
IS DOING IT'S STAFFING DOWN.
FOLKS WORKING ARE LEAVING AND
GOING BACK TO THE OFFICES FROM
WHICH THEY WERE DETAILED.
THEY ARE OUT SOURCING AND
DELEGATING MATTERS BACK TO
COMPONENT AGENCY OR COMPARTMENTS
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
AND U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
THAT SIGNALS A WINDING DOWN AND
THEY WILL ACCEPT WRITTEN ANSWERS
FROM DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS ON
ALL MATTERS.
>> RIGHT.
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE
HEADED TO NO CHARGES OF
COLLUSION WITH ANYONE FROM THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
BOB MUELLER MIGHT HAVE SOME
