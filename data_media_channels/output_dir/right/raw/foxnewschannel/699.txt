GET BACK WITH THEIR PARENTS.

13
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,131
>> IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES IN

14
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:35,700
FLORIDA HAVE BEEN BUSY LONG

15
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,401
BEFORE THE FAMILY SEPARATION

16
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,370

00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,178
3rd MOST IN AMERICA.

20
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:50,381

00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:53,351
UNDER GO THE SAME DANGEROUS

22
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:53,684
JOURNEY.

OUR MILITARY IS OVERSEAS

28

FIGHTING THAT FRONT FOR US.

29
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,901
WE HAVE TO DO IT HERE.

PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION

32
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:30,622
NON-LATINO POPULATION.

33
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,924
>> MOST OF THE TALK ABOUT THE

34
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:33,592

FLORIDA.

42
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,857
SHOULD THESE SEPARATIONS EVER

43
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,426
HAVE BEEN USED BY THE

44
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:12,665
ADMINISTRATION AS A DETERRENT TO

45
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,267
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OR WAS THAT

46
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,234
A MISTAKE?

47
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,671
>> THE FOLKS THAT COME ILLEGALLY

00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,309
OWN COUNTRY.

49
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,724

MILITARY ON OUR BORDER TO SECURE

51
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:40,994
IT.

52
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,464
AS COMMISSIONER HE ENDORSED THE

53
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:52,539
GANG OF 8, IMMIGRATION AMNESTY

54
00:02:54,809 --> 00:03:00,814
TO DO E-VERIFY TO SHUT OFF THE

55
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,183
JOBS SPIGOT, IT WOULD BE GOOD

56
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,820
FOR TAXPAYERS, HE TWISTED ARMS

57
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,156
IN THE STATE SENATE AND HELPED

58
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:11,691
KILL IT BEHIND THE SEQUENCE.

59
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,692
-- SCENES.

60
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,128
HE DIDN’T PUT FLORIDA THERE.

61
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,901
HE PUT BIG DONORS AHEAD OF THE

62
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,509
TO GIVE YOU THE FULL-TIME TO

63
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:28,909
RESPOND.

VOTED TO GIVE FOOD STAMPS TO

66
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:37,718
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.

67
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,252
>> THAT’S NOT TRUE.

68
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:38,686
YOU KNOW THAT!

69
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:39,887
COME ON!

70
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:40,955
>> HERE’S THE DEAL.

00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:42,957
>> [LAUGHING].

72
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,692
>> LET’S TALK ABOUT FLORIDA.

73
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:48,696
OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS NEED TO BE

74
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,533
SECURE OUR BORDERS.

75
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,774
A PERMANENT RESOLUTION TO THE

76
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:00,908
DACA CHILDREN.

77
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,878
WASHINGTON AS RECENTLY AS THIS

78
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,613
WEEK, WASHINGTON YET AGAIN LET

79
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,216
US DOWN AND LET THE PRESIDENT

80
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:13,321
DOWN BY NOT PASSING A FIX TO

81
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,255
IMMIGRATION.

82
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:19,827
HERE IN FLORIDA, OUR 21 MILLION

83
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,695
FLORIDIANS ARE PLAYING

84
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,968
CLOTHE AND HOUSE CRIMINAL

85
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,670
ILLEGAL ALIENS IN OUR PRISON

86
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:30,772
THAT HAS END.

87
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:33,775
IT WILL END AS PART OF MY SECURE

88
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:34,609
FLORIDA FIRST AGENDA.

89
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,780
THE SHERIFF YOU SAW IN THE CLIP

90
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:39,447
ENDORSED ME.

91
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,551
YOUR SHERIFF ENDORSED ME AND I.

92
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:43,718
EXCITED ABOUT 45 SHERIFFS WHO

93
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:44,986
HAVE ENDORSED ME.

94
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:46,588
THEY KNOW BOTH OF OUR RECORDS

95
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,857
AND THEY KNOW WHO IS BEST FOR

96
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:52,661
SECURING OUR BORDERS AND KEEPING

97
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,630
FLORIDIANS SAFE.

98
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,831
>> HE DIDN’T REFUTE ANYTHING

99
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:57,232
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE.

100
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,967
IF I AM GOVERNOR I WILL WORK

101
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:02,671
HARD AND WILL SIGN E-VERIFY INTO

102
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:03,472
LAW IN FLORIDA.

103
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:05,641
HE WON’T DO THAT.

104
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:08,444
BECAUSE HIS BIG DONORS WANT THAT

105
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:09,445
CHEAP FOREIGN LABOR.

106
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,880
THAT LOWERS WAGES FOR

107
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:12,281
FLORIDIANS.

108
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:13,515
IT’S BAD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND

109
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:15,150
NOT GOOD FOR TAXPAYERS.

110
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:17,286
FOR HIM TO SAY I SUPPORTED BEN

111
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:19,121
GETS FOR ILLEGALS.

112
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:20,856
THAT’S DEAD WRONG.

113
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:23,225
I VOTED AGAINST A FARM BILL THAT

114
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:26,128
HAD OBAMA’S FOOD STAMP PROGRAM

115
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:26,495
CODIFIED.

116
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:28,264
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE BILL.

117
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,398
I WAS RIGHT TO VOTE NO.

118
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,333
WHAT HE IS SAYING IS NOT TRUE.

119
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:35,538
HE IS WEAK ON THE BORDER.

120
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,207
HE HAS BEEN WEAK ON ILLEGAL

121
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,310
IMMIGRANTS AND SUPPORTED THE

122
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,880
GANG OF 8 AMNESTY WHICH IS

123
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,915
A TERRIBLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

124
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,151
>> COMMISSIONER, YOU ENDORSED

125
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:50,286
THE FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR JEB

126
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,888
BUSH IN 2016.

127
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,623
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT OF THE

128
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:54,590
REASON HE LOST WAS BECAUSE OF

129
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,360
THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE.

130
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:58,461
DO YOU THINK HE WAS RIGHT.

131
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,563
>> LOOK, HE WAS MY FRIEND AND

132
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:06,603
OUR

133
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:09,506

00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:10,140
GOVERNOR.

135
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:11,975
I AM PROUD OF WHAT HE DID FOR

136
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:13,510
OUR STATE.

137
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:16,246
HE WAS FOCUSED ON FLORIDA.

138
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:21,718
I AM FOCUSED ON FLORIDA.

139
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:22,319
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

140
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,155
MY SECURE FLORIDA FIRST PLAN

141
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:26,523
WILL REINSTATE THE RELATIONSHIP

142
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:27,924
WITH I.C.E. THAT WENT AWAY UNDER

00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:38,535
I’M SUPPORTED BY

LAW ENFORCEMENT, PBA, FOP AND 45

145
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:41,572
SHERIFFS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN

146
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:42,639
BOTH RECORDS AND ENDORSED ME TO

147
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,909
BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR TO KEEP

148
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,910
FLORIDIAN SAFE.

149
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,912
THAT IS WHAT A FLORIDA FIRST

150
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:51,348
AGENDA IS, AND THAT IS WHAT THE
