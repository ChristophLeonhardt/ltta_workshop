FROM THE CARAVAN MOVING THROUGH

3
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:12,991
GUATEMALA HAS REPORTEDLY REACHED

4
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:14,993
THE BORDER WITH MEXICO.

5
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:15,827
THIS COMES HOURS AFTER

6
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:16,861
PRESIDENT TRUMP THREATENED TO

7
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:18,630
SEND IN THE MILITARY TO SECURE

8
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,198
THE BORDER IF THE MIGRANTS

9
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,066
AREN'T STOPPED.

10
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:21,800
THE PRESIDENT BLAMING DEMOCRATS

11
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:24,836
FOR THE NEW CRISIS ON TWITTER,

12
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:26,004
CLAIMING THEIR SUPPORT OF WEAK

13
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,239
IMMIGRATION LAWS IS MAKING THE

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,207
SITUATION WORSE.

15
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,241
MEANWHILE, NANCY PELOSI IS

16
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:31,609

18
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:36,214
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

19
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:38,283

FUNDING.

22
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,419
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

23
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,420
SECURE OUR BORDERS.

24
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:45,056
THERE ARE WEIGHTS TO THAT

25
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:45,757
CONSISTENT WITH CIVILIZATION,

26
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:46,925
HUMANITARIANISM, AND WHO WE ARE

27
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:47,659
AS A NATION.

28
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,227
WE HAVE TO REMOVE ALL DOUBT

29
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:50,061
ABOUT THAT.

30
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,263

00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:04,209
FOX NEWS POLL SAYING BORDER

37
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:04,975
SECURITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

38
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:08,613
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AT 58%,

THIS NEW CARAVAN MOVING ITS WAY

43
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,523
NORTH, NOT GOOD TIMING FOR

44
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:19,791
DEMOCRATS.

45
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,926
>> Jesse: VISUALLY IT HAS A

46
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:23,395
BIG IMPACT ON VOTERS WHEN THEY

47
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:24,028
SEE THIS.

48
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:25,630
IT'S NOT A THEORETICAL PROBLEM.

49
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,031
NOT JUST THIS ONE CARAVAN.

50
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:28,900
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IN TERMS

51
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:31,069
OF SIZE, CARAVANS LIKE THIS ARE

52
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,437
COMING ACROSS THE BORDER ALL DAY

53
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:33,138
EVERY DAY, AND THERE'S REALLY

54
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,007
NOT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE A

55
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,275
LOT OF THESE LOOPHOLES ARE BAKED

56
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:38,743
INTO OUR IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM

57
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:39,277
SYSTEM.

58
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,446
IT USED TO BE ADULT MALE

59
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:42,847
MEXICANS CROSSING THE BORDER.

60
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:45,083
NOW IT'S MOSTLY FAMILIES AND

61
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:46,684
TEENAGERS FROM GUATEMALA AND

62
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:47,519
FROM HONDURAS.

63
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,255
WE CAN'T TURN THEM BACK.

64
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:51,956
THE MEXICANS YOU COULD, BUT YOU

65
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:53,024
HAVE TO BRING IN AND TAKE, WHEN

66
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,493
YOU APPREHEND THEM, INTO THE

67
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:56,294
REST OF THE COUNTRY.

68
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:59,230
THEY ARE CLAIMING CREDIBLE FEAR.

69
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:01,132
CREDIBLE FEAR, THAT EXCUSE HAS

70
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,468
SPIKED OVER THE COUPLE YEARS.

71
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,637
YET WHEN THEY USE IT, THE

72
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:08,506
ECONOMY IN HONDURAS IS GOING UP,

73
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:10,108
YET CRIME IN HONDURAS IS GOING

74
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:10,608
DOWN.

75
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,043
IT MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT THESE

76
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:14,012
PEOPLE ARE BEING COACHED.

77
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,648
YOU ARE HEARING THINGS LIKE

78
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:17,348
NGOs SENDING ACTIVISTS AND

79
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,650
LAWYERS DOWN TO CENTRAL AMERICAN

80
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:19,651
COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE HELPING

81
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:20,985
THEM WITH THE CARAVAN.

82
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:21,719
THEY ARE COACHING THEM ON WHAT

83
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,421
TO SAY WHEN THEY GET TO THE

84
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:23,755
BORDER.

85
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:24,456
IT'S INTERESTING.

86
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,690
WHERE DO THEY GET THE CAMERAS

87
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:26,658
FROM?

88
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,460
WE ARE HEARING A LOT OF THESE

89
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:30,295
NGOs ARE BRINGING THESE CAMERA

90
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:31,129
CREWS IN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE

91
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,630
PEOPLE GET OFF THE VAN, THEY

92
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:35,099
WALK WHEN THE CAMERA CREWS COME

93
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,366
OUT.

94
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,534
THE CAMERA CREW STOP REPORTING

95
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:37,902
AND THEY HOPPED IN THE VAN.

96
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:39,904
ONCE I GET TO MEXICO, THEY PAY

97
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,607
THE DRUG CARTELS AND THE

98
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:44,042
SMUGGLERS $5,000 PER FAMILY UNIT

99
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,543
TO GET THEM ACROSS.

100
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:47,045
THE DRUG CARTELS ARE THE ONLY

101
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:48,546
ONES MAKING ANY MONEY IN THIS

102
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:49,047
PROCESS.

103
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,782
THE DRUG CARTELS AND THE OPEN

104
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:52,250
BORDER DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE ON

105
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,052
THE SAME SIDE.

106
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:57,055
THESE DRUG CARTELS HAVE MADE

107
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:57,889
$2.5 BILLION IN SMUGGLING ALONE

108
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,623
PER YEAR.

109
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:00,258
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DRUG

110
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,060
PROFITS, AND THAT'S A LOT OF

111
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:02,360
MONEY.

112
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:03,328
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

113
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:04,395
IMMIGRATION LAWS SO THAT YOU

114
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:06,264
TREAT PEOPLE WHO CROSS THE

115
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:07,665
BORDER IF YOU ARE FROM

116
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,633
CENTRAL AMERICA THE SAME WAY YOU

117
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:11,503
DO IS IF YOU ARE FROM CANADA AND

118
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:11,836
MEXICO.

119
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:15,340
>> Dana: KENNEDY, THE OTHER

120
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,608
THINGS, IN THESE CARAVANS,

121
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:17,342
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

122
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:18,042
REPORTING THAT THE NUMBER OF

123
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:18,710
SEXUAL ASSAULT TAPPING ALONG

124
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:21,546
THIS ROUTE AND NOT JUST -- IN

125
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,015
THE CARAVAN, AS JESSE WAS

126
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:24,716
SAYING, 1600 MIGRANTS TRY TO

127
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,684
CROSS THE BORDER A DAY.

128
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,253
THEY ARE FINDING REPEATED

129
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:29,621
INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, FOR

130
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:30,054
CHILDREN EVEN.

131
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:31,256
THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE

132
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:31,556
BOARD.

133
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:33,892
>> Kennedy: IT'S HORRIBLE.

134
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:36,027
WE SAW SOME OF THAT

135
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:37,228
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE SHELTERS IN

136
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,230
THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE

137
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,031
FLORENCE.

138
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:41,399
IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE ASPECT OF

139
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,833
HUMAN NATURE.

140
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,969
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO LET

141
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,304
REALLY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE

142
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:47,472
COUNTRY AND KEEP REALLY BAD

143
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:48,406
PEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

144
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:49,240
THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T DONE THAT

145
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,309
AND I THINK PART OF IT REST ON

146
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,444
CONGRESS BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT A

147
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,213
VERY CONFUSING IMMIGRATION

148
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:55,547
SYSTEM.

149
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:56,848
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, I AM

150
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,849
CONVINCED THIS IS THE ONE ISSUE

151
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,851
WHERE THEY WILL NEVER WORK

152
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:00,585
TOGETHER BUT IT'S INTERESTING

153
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,221
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRESIDENT,

154
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,790
EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND        H

155
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:05,823
EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND        R

156

EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND        -

157
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:05,890
EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND        I

EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND        E

EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEHIND        R

160
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:06,858
RHETORICALLY AND IMMIGRATION,

161
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:07,992
THERE'S A LOT HE WOULD GIVE TO

162
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:08,726
DEMOCRATS IN ORDER TO COME UP

163
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,028
WITH COMPROMISE.

164
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:11,095
I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD SEE THAT

165
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:13,064
WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

166
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,867
AND REPUBLICANS IN THE SAME WAY

167
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:16,668
OR WITH PAST REPUBLICANS

168
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,134
ADMINISTRATIONS.

169
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:17,669
THEY NEED TO FIX IT.

170
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,536
IF YOU THINK BY THE KIND PEOPLE

171
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:19,836
YOU WANT TO HAVE IN THIS

172
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:20,939
COUNTRY, YOU WANT PEOPLE ARE

173
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,073
HARDWORKING COME PEOPLE WHO ARE

174
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:24,475
ETHICAL, PEOPLE WHO LOOK OUT FOR

175
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:25,610
THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR

176
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,778
COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE

177
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,246
VERY PHYSICALLY STRONG.

178
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,347
I THINK WE NEED TO SET UP AN

179
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,950
AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR AT THE

180
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:34,052

181
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:38,389
-- CAN'T MAKE IT.

00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:55,006
PROBLEMS THAT LEAD FAMILIES TO

190
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:56,174
DECIDE THAT THEIR BEST PROSPECT

191
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:57,241
IS TO COME TOWARD THE

192
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:58,042
UNITED STATES.

193
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,444
AS WE KNOW, THEIR ECONOMIES HAVE

194
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,244
BEEN SUFFERING.

195
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:01,980
I THINK THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE

196
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:02,447
REASON.

197
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:04,649
I'M INTERESTED IN THIS AS A

198
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,618
POLITICAL PLOY BY REPUBLICANS

199
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,019
BECAUSE CLEARLY IMMIGRATION IS

200
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,187
NOT A BIG ISSUE IN THIS

201
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:10,455
CAMPAIGN.

202
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:11,289
ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, 7% OF

203
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,657
PEOPLE SAY IT'S A BIG ISSUE.

204
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:15,660
AND THAT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS

205
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:18,429
HEALTH CARE.

206
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,330
>> Kennedy: ACCORDING TO THE

207
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,132
POLL DANA JOE SHALL COMMENCE

208
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,600
NUMBER FOUR.

209
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,238
>> Juan: EXTREME PEOPLE.

210
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,240
THE BIG ISSUE IS HEALTH CARE NEW

211
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,608
START LOOKING AT THE SECONDARY

212
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:32,010
ISSUE, RANDY AND

213
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:32,710
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND THE THIRD

214
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,681
ONE IS PEOPLE WHO WANT DEMOCRATS

215
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:38,750
TO CONTROL THE HOUSE OF

216
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:39,250
REPRESENTATIVES.

217
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,018
>> Dana: WHAT ABOUT THIS

218
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,451
ISSUE?

219
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:41,819
WE HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS

220
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,221
OTHER ISSUES BUT WHAT ABOUT

221
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,056
NANCY PELOSI SAYING THAT THEY

222
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:46,124
WON'T WORK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

223
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,925
TO ME, IT'S NOT A RIGHT AND LEFT

224
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,060
ISSUE.

225
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,663
IT'S EFFECTIVE YOU HAVE A

226
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:52,296
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, WITH

227
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:52,964
CHILDREN BEING SENT TO THE

228
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,565
HOSPITAL AS THEY HAVE TO STOP AT

229
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,466
WEIGH STATIONS.

230
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,668
THEY ARE DEHYDRATED.

231
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:57,602
SOME OF BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL

232
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:57,935
ASSAULT.

233
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:02,440
IF THEY GET HERE -- IT'S NOT

234
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:02,740
TRUE?

235
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:04,409
>> Juan: I SAID IT'S NOT GOOD.

236
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,443
>> Dana: NOT GOOD.

237
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:08,479
WHY WOULD NANCY PELOSI BE

238
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,880
SIGNALING?

239
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:09,847
>> Kennedy: I NEED TO PUSH

240
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:11,416
BACK ON YOU, JUAN.

241
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,051
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CORRECTION.

242
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:14,252
IT WASN'T EXTREME VOTERS.

243
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:16,287
IT WAS A POLL OF LIKELY VOTERS.

244
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,722
>> Juan: NO, NO, PEOPLE WHO

245
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:20,124
ARE EXTREME THE CONCERN.

246
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,992
>> Dana: AMONG THOSE WHO SAY

247
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,861
IT BORDER SECURITY IS THE MOST

248
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:24,228
IMPORTANT.

249
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:24,862
>> Juan: OKAY, I THINK YOU

250
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:27,665
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND NANCY PELOSI

251
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,668
IS TALKING ABOUT THE WALL AND

252
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:31,602
ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS PERSISTENCE

253
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,171
-- I THINK YESTERDAY WE QUOTED

254
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:35,707
HER AS SAYING THAT IT WAS A

255
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,274
MANHOOD ISSUE.

256
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:37,141
IT'S A POLITICAL ISSUE.

257
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:39,143
HE SEES IT AS A PROMISE HE MADE

258
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,378
WAS BASIN HE WANTS TO DELIVER

259
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,381
FIRST BASE BUT IF YOU GO BACK IN

260
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:44,682
TIME, REMEMBER GOING BACK TO

261
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:45,149
PRESIDENT BUSH,

262
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,484
PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU ARE

263
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:47,652
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS

264
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:48,986
WORKING ON THE IMMIGRATION

265
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,455
ISSUE, WORKING ON BORDER

266
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:50,822
SECURITY.

267
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:52,423
TRUMP HAS MADE IT ALL ABOUT THE

268
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:53,858
WALL, AND WHAT NANCY PELOSI IS

269
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,326
SAYING HEY, THIS IS NOT ABOUT

270
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:56,227
THE WALL.

271
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:57,495
IT'S NOT A GOOD EXPENSIVE MONEY

272
00:06:57,496 --> 00:07:01,899
OR TIME AND CERTAINLY NOT TO BE

273
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,366
MEAN TO PEOPLE.

274
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:04,102
>> Dana: ONE OF THE THINGS

275
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:05,103
NANCY PELOSI SAYS IS THIS IS NOT

276
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:08,206
WHO WE ARE AS A NATION.

277
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,373
>> Greg: IT'S A COP-OUT.

278
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,641
IT'S DISGUSTING.

279
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,410
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

280
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,846
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AS JUAN SAID,

281
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:15,847
BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OBAMA

282
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:16,748
UNDERSTOOD BORDER SECURITY HELPS

283
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,050
TO FIND A COUNTRY AND LIKE IT OR

284
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,718
NOT, THE WALL IS ACTUALLY PART

285
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:21,419
OF BORDER SECURITY.

286
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,854
HOW COULD IT NOT BE?

287
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:23,387
WE HAVE FENCES.

288
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:27,024
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT INTERESTED

289
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:34,465
IN PUTTING UP A WALL.

290
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,199
IF YOU ARE ON SAFARI AND YOU ARE

291
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,867
BEING CHASED BY A RINO, YOU

292
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:36,501
HAPPEN TO THE FIRST ROCK.

293
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:37,201
YOU DON'T WAIT FOR THE FOURTH

294
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:37,468
ONE.

295
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:47,745
THERE'S A HUGE DISHONESTY GOING

296
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:48,012
ON.

297
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:48,679
THEY IGNORE THE LAND BETWEEN

298
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,380
HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA AND THE

299
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:49,814
UNITED STATES.

300
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:50,515
IMAGINE HOW MANY LIVES WILL BE

301
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,083
SAVED AND HOW MANY RAPES WOULD

302
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:53,518
BE PREVENTED IF THEY WERE ABLE

303
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,252
TO STOP.

304
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:55,153
ONCE THEY LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY

305
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:57,155
AND LAY CLAIM TO SOME LAND

306
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:57,889
RATHER THAN RISKING THEIR LIVES

307
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,257
MAKING IT TO THE BORDER.

308
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,658
IT'S A HUGE HYPOCRISY THAT

309
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:02,026
SOMEHOW WE ARE ENCOURAGING

310
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:02,927
PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS TERRIBLE,

311
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,163
TERRIBLE JOURNEY BECAUSE -- FOR

312
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:07,665
SOME KIND OF POLITICAL OPTICS.

313
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,534
I HATE USING THE WORD OPTICS.

314
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:11,435
TO YOUR POINT, WHERE IS THE

315
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:14,739
ME TOO MOVEMENT?

316
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,474
YOU ARE PUTTING WOMEN IN DANGER

317
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,443
FOR THIS ISSUE.

318
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:21,245
WHERE ARE YOU?

319
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:23,047
HOW CAN YOU ALLOW THIS TO

320
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:23,381
HAPPEN?

321
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,849
THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY

322
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,249
DISGUSTING.

323
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,752
>> Kennedy: YOU MAKE A GOOD

324
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:28,653
POINT ABOUT MEXICO.

325
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:30,154
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS TO MAKE

326
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:31,389
YOU TAKE SOME OF THE HYPERBOLE

327
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,323
AND RHETORIC OUT OF IT AND YOU

328
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,090
LOOK AT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

329
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,661
SAYING, HE'S APPEALING TO

330
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:36,994
MEXICO.

331
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:39,363
ASIDE FROM THREATENING TO SHUT

332
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:40,131
DOWN THE SOUTHERN BORDER, BUT

333
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,033
THEY DO HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY

334
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:45,636
HERE, AND THEY DO OPEN UP BOTH

335
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:46,437
BORDERS IN ORDER TO SOME PEOPLE

336
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,706
FURTHERMORE WITH.

337
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:53,444
IT'S A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE.

338
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,645
MEXICO IS A HUMANITARIAN COUNTRY

339
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:55,646
WITH PEOPLE WHO CARE VERY MUCH

340
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:56,881
ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS AND

341
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:57,849
NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH AND

342
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,884
SOUTH, THEN WHY DON'T THEY HAVE

343
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:01,419
BETTER SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO

344
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,255
ABSORB SOME OF THE REFUGEES?

345
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:06,858
>> Greg: THE OTHER LIE IS THAT

346
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:07,692
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS MAKE YOUR LIFE

347
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,827
-- PUT YOUR LIFE IN THREAT.

348
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:11,395
IT'S LIKE NO, IT'S LIKE STAY IN

349
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:13,764
THE COUNTRY AND DEAL WITH THESE

350
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:14,265
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS.

351
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:16,868
>> Juan: WE HAVE A HISTORY IN

352
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:17,635
AMERICA PEOPLE FROM CUBA GETTING

353
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:21,839
ON THE HIGH SEAS.

354
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,641
>> Greg: WHEREVER THERE IS

355
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:24,709
LEFTISM, THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE

356
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,243
IN DANGER.

357
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:27,645
>> Juan: THERE'S A HISTORY OF

358
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:28,346
PEOPLE PUTTING THEMSELVES AT

359
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,548
GREAT RISK IN ORDER TO REACH OUR

360
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,416
SHORES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN

361
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:33,050
AMERICA.

362
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,318
THEY LIKE THE FINANCIAL

363
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:34,719
OPPORTUNITY.

364
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,020
>> Greg: THERE IS SOMETHING

365
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:37,088
BETWEEN HERE AND THEY ARE:

366
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:37,421
MEXICO.

367
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:39,857
>> Juan: WE HAVE A BETTER,

368
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:40,825
STRONGER ECONOMY THAN MEXICO.

369
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,627
>> Greg: YOU HAVE A MENU OF

370
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:43,561
OPTIONS YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM.

371
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,495
>> Juan: I'M TELLING YOU

372
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,397
THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES ARE FOCUSED

373
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:46,697
ON.

374
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:47,632
I THINK THEY ARE FOCUSED ON

375
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:52,737
THEIR CHILDREN.

376
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:53,404
>> Dana: WANT TO GO BACK TO

377
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:53,971
SOMETHING JESSE SAID.

378
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:55,973
THAT IS THAT THE DRUG CARTEL,

379
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:57,842
APPARENTLY THERE'S NOT A SINGLE

380
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:58,576
PERSON THAT'S COME ACROSS THE

381
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,444
BORDER BUT HASN'T HAD TO PAY

382
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:01,312
SOME SORT OF MONEY AS A FAMILY

383
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:05,449
OR INDIVIDUAL TO THE DRUG

384
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,117
CARTELS.

385
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:07,852
PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT

386
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:08,819
HE COULD FIND A BIPARTISAN

387
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,820
AGREEMENT, FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

388
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,622
HER TARGET OF THE DRUG CARTELS,

389
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:13,391
THE LEADERS OF THEIR FINANCES,

390
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:14,492
AND SHUT THEM DOWN.

391
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,093
>> Jesse: THEY ARE MAKING

392
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,528
FISTFULS OF CASH EVERY DAY FROM

393
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:18,796
THE SMUGGLING OPERATIONS ON TOP

394
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:20,464
OF THE PROFITS THEY ARE MAKING

395
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,767
FROM HEROIN, COCAINE, AND

396
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:23,501
MARIJUANA.

397
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:24,302
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

398
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,337
THE POSITION THEY ARE IN BY

399
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:29,240
HAVING OPEN BORDERS POLICIES

400
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,042
ONLY EMPOWERS THE DRUG CARTELS.

401
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,643
IT EMPOWERS NO ONE ELSE.

402
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:33,844
ONLY THE DRUG CARTELS.

403
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,947
I AM HAPPY THAT JUAN WOULD ADMIT

404
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:38,649
THAT THE TRUMP ECONOMY IS SO

405
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,417
STRONG, PEOPLE ARE RISKING THEIR

406
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:41,552
LIVES TO COME TO AMERICA TO GET

407
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:43,120
A PIECE OF THE PIE.

408
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:44,822
>> Juan: I SAID THE AMERICAN

409
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:45,156
ECONOMY.

410
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,424
BY THE WAY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND

411
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:47,658
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

412
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,359
I DON'T GET IT.

413
00:10:48,360 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS NOTHING
