Oh now I am never one to let an opportunity for a stereotype to go to waste so while we're here initially Novgorod for this last 16 round I'm here on the Volga to meet up with some Vikings so when I'm not playing up to those stereotypes of course I've managed to find some Danish fans here in Nizhny Novgorod to have a little chat to me about what's going on we are ashamed of having a bat we thought that's going to Russia would see the bad time but hey none of that has been through this is what I wanted to ask you because there was a lot made to the English funds we were all told don't come to Russia it's really dangerous will you told the same thing exactly the same thing at home my family and my college told me don't get killed like that and how have you found it it's rubbish it's so easy everyone is really friendly and it's so nice we all having a great time all the countries and nation and Russian this together is one big group what we have seen know as well as they amongst the fans is the emotion has really got through a lot of people we've seen the Panamanians they took over this town when they were here oh the Danes gonna do the same the panamanian said they were bringing carnival - - to Russia what was the Danes bring we are not that many Danes tomorrow I've heard like 800 baby but when we are there at the stadium we are gonna chance all 90 minutes and extend it if needed we're gonna chance because we wanted Ange to succeed and we want the days to feel that we are here for them and he want them to true they should be the best what is the Danish song come on last note you
