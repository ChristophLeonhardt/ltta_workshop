00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:11,692
>> Neil: IT IS LOOKING

3
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:12,526
BETTER FOR GINA HASPEL TO BE

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:14,195
THE FIRST WOMAN TO HOLD THE

5
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:15,563
CIA DIRECTOR AS SOME KEY

6
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:16,397
SENATE REPUBLICANS AND A

7
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:17,698
NUMBER OF TOP DEMOCRATS HAVE

8
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,733
SAID THEY WOULD BE YEA VOTES

9
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,068
FOR THE PRESIDENT'S CHOICE

10
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:22,903
TO HEAD THAT, INCLUDING MARK

11
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:24,038
WARNER WHO HAS SAID THAT HE

12
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:25,573
WOULD SUPPORT HER IN THAT

13
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:25,906
EFFORT.

14
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,275
SO FAR, NOT SUCH A

15
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,243
COMMITMENT FROM REPUBLICAN

16
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:30,211
KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL.

17
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:31,645
HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW.

18
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:32,546
SENATOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:33,981
>> THANKS, NEIL.

20
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:35,616
>> Neil: I DID CATCH YOUR

21
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:38,853
LETTER TO MS. HASPEL TO FIND

22
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,387
OUT HOW SHE STANDS ON A

23
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:41,388
COUPLE OF KEY ISSUES.

24
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:42,456
MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK

25
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:44,258
THIS HAS TO DO WITH TAR

26
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:44,658
TEMPERATURE.

27
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:45,793
YOUR LETTER ADDRESSES FAR

28
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:46,360
BIGGER ISSUES.

29
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,294
COULD YOU EXPLAIN?

30
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,863
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M

31
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:53,467
CONCERNED THERE ARE REPORTS

32
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:56,337
THAT JOHN BRENNAN WAS

33
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:57,238
COOPERATING WITH BRITISH

34
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:58,639
INTELLIGENCE TO SPY ON THE

35
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:59,206
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

36
00:00:59,206 --> 00:00:59,907
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

37
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:02,476
SOME ARE SAYING OH IT WAS

38
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:03,277
INCIDENTALLY COLLECTED.

39
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:04,278
IT'S STILL A BIG DEAL.

40
00:01:04,278 --> 00:01:05,212
THERE IS A QUESTION, THERE

41
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:06,547
ARE SOME ACCUSATIONS

42
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,114
ACTUALLY ORDERED BY

43
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:09,049
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

44
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:09,617
ADMINISTRATION EITHER

45
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:11,085
THROUGH JOHN BRENNAN OR

46
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:11,418
OTHERS.

47
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:12,686
GINA HASPEL IS THE ACTING

48
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:13,754
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA.

49
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,723
SHE IS HIGH ENOUGH UP IN THE

50
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:15,990
CIA.

51
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,358
I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT

52
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:19,226
SHE KNOWS ABOUT WHETHER THE

53
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,761
TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS

54
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,595
SURVEILLED UPON.

55
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:23,964
WE DO KNOW THAT JOHN

56
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,199
BRENNAN, SINCE HE HAS LEFT

57
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,301
GOVERNMENT, HAS BECOME AN

58
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,435
OUTSPOKEN PARTISAN AGAINST

59
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:30,571
THE PRESIDENT IN VERY

60
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,305
DEFAMATORY TERMS.

61
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:32,606
SO, YES, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

62
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:34,408
GINA HASPEL BEING A CLOSE

63
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,076
ACHE LIGHT OF JOHN BRENNAN.

64
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,978
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

65
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,713
FROM HER IF SHE IS APPOINTED

66
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,448
IF SHE IS INDEED APPOINTED,

67
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:42,316
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT

68
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,651
DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT THE

69
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:44,551
SURVEILLANCE OF THE TRUMP

70
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,787
CAMPAIGN AND WHY WAS THE CIA

71
00:01:46,787 --> 00:01:47,221
INVOLVED.

72
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:47,888
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK THAT

73
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:51,025
SHE SHARES FORMER DIRECTOR

74
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:51,659
BRENNAN'S CONTEMPT?

75
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,794
>> I THINK THAT SHE IS A

76
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,529
CLOSE ACHE LIGHT OF JOHN

77
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:55,863
BRENNAN.

78
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:57,131
I THINK SOME HAVE CALLED HER

79
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,365
A PROTEGE.

80
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:01,168
I WORRY NOW WE HAVE SEEN

81
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,303
JOHN BRENNAN'S STRIPES.

82
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:04,371
IS HE A PARTISAN.

83
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,172
HATER OF DONALD TRUMP.

84
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:06,273
SO I DON'T WANT PEOPLE

85
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:07,107
RUNNING OUR INTELLIGENCE

86
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:10,344
AGENCIES THAT HAVE AN AX TO

87
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:14,048
GRIND OR HAVE SOME SORT OF

88
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:15,082
PARTISANSHIP LURKING BENEATH

89
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:16,517
THE SERVICE.

90
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:17,618
NUMBER OF REASONS WHY I

91
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,252
OPPOSE HER.

92
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:24,558
NUMBER ONE IS TORTURE.

93
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:25,793
THE CIA WAS.

94
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,061
SENDING PEOPLE TO BE

95
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,796
TORTURED IN ASSAD, SYRIA.

96
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,230
NOW, WE SAY ASSAD IS A

97
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,365
TERRIBLE GUY BECAUSE HE

98
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:32,800
GASSED HIS PEOPLE IN ALL

99
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,467
LIKELIHOOD.

100
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,601
WELL, SOMEBODY IN THE CIA

101
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,669
THOUGHT HE WAS A GREAT GUY

102
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,273
BECAUSE HE WAS SO BEARING

103
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:40,007
AND TORTURE PEOPLE.

104
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:41,642
THE PROBLEM IS 20% OF THE

105
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:43,577
PEOPLE THAT WERE TORTURED

106
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:44,878
WRONG IDENTITY GOT THE WRONG

107
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:45,212
PEOPLE.

108
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,947
THAT IS A MISTAKE AND DARK

109
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:49,583
PERIOD FOUR HISTORY AND WE

110
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,384
SHOULDN'T REWARD SOMEONE

111
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:50,884
LIKE GINA HASPEL.

112
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,152
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE

113
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:53,420
REVELATIONS OUT OF THE NORTH

114
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,322
KOREANS WANT OUT.

115
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,623
TIME BEING WITH THE SOUTH

116
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:56,957
KOREANS?

117
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,292
SOME SAY THAT IS A PREVIEW

118
00:02:58,292 --> 00:02:59,927
TO MAYBE WALKING OUT

119
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:02,963
UPCOMING TALKS WITH THE

120
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:03,330
PRESIDENT.

121
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,533
>> I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT

122
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,601
IS IMPORTANT WE ARE TALKING

123
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,535
BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE

124
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:09,570
SOUTH KOREANS ARE TALKING.

125
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,871
DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN NORTH

126
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,639
AND SOUTH KOREA ARE

127
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,307
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

128
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:14,441
THE ONLY WAY PEACE COMES TO

129
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,211
THE PENINSULA IS WHERE THEY

130
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:18,779
ARE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN

131
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:19,079
TALKS.

132
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,381
I HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED OVER

133
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,749
THE PAST MONTH THAT THERE

134
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:23,317
HAS BEEN MORE TALK THAN

135
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:25,152
THERE HAS BEEN FOR A LONG

136
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:25,652
TIME.

137
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:26,487
>> Neil: FOR F. FOR SOME

138
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,822
REASON THE NORTH KOREANS ARE

139
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:31,592
SUDDENLINELY MAKING BIG ADO

140
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:32,526
ABOUT JOINT MILITARY

141
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:33,560
EXERCISES WITH THE SOUTH

142
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:33,894
KOREANS.

143
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:34,628
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

144
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:35,496
DO YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO

145
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:36,797
SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THAT OR

146
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:37,097
WHAT?

147
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:41,235
>> WELL, I THINK THEY HAVE A

148
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,836
GOOD FAITH STOPPED THEIR

149
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:43,904
TESTING SO FAR AS WE CAN

150
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:44,204
TELL.

151
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:44,872
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY HAVE

152
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:46,106
COMPLETED ALL THEIR TESTING.

153
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:47,574
THEY HAVE AT LEAST AGREED TO

154
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:48,776
STOP THEIR NUCLEAR TESTING.

155
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,177
I THINK NOT DOING MILITARY

156
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:50,911
EXERCISES WOULD ACTUALLY BE

157
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,413
A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH ON OUR

158
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:52,780
PART.

159
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,548
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING

160
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:54,948
PERMANENTLY.

161
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:55,682
BUT DELAYING THAT UNTIL

162
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,017
AFTER TALKS I THINK WOULD BE

163
00:03:57,017 --> 00:04:01,455
A GOOD IDEA.

164
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:02,156
>> Neil: MUCH HAS BEEN MADE

165
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:03,657
OF THESE COMMENTS THAT A

166
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,025
WHITE HOUSE AIDE MADE

167
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:09,863
CONCERNING JOHN MCCAIN.

168
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:12,699
THEY WERE CRUDE, RUDE, IN

169
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,834
POLITIC, MANY ADMINISTRATION

170
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,202
PEOPLE HAVE COME ON MY AIR

171
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:16,403
AND SAYING THE SAME THING.

172
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:18,605
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT

173
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:19,273
AND WHETHER THE

174
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:19,973
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE

175
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,575
ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THAT?

176
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,443
SHOULD SHE GO?

177
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:22,976
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

178
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,378
>> JOHN MCCAIN AND I HAVE

179
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:25,512
HAD MANY SPIRITED

180
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:26,180
DISAGREEMENTS BUT WE

181
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,815
ACTUALLY DO AGREE ON TORTURE

182
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:28,615
AND GINA HASPEL THAT SHE

183
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:29,917
SHOULDN'T BE NOMINATED TO BE

184
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:30,451
THE HEAD.

185
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,019
SO I TRY TO FIND AREAS OF

186
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:33,320
AGREEMENT WHEN I CAN WITH

187
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,023
JOHN MCCAIN AND I THINK IT'S

188
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,624
SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY

189
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,459
INAPPROPRIATE AND SHOULD NOT

190
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,127
HAVE BEEN SAID.

191
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:41,161
>> Neil: WOULD YOU FIRE THE

192
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,196
PERSON WHO SAID IT?

193
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:51,138
>> IF THEY WORKED FOR ME.

194
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:51,939
>> Neil: DOES IT TROUBLE YOU

195
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:52,773
SHE IS ON THE JOB?

196
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,441
>> I CAN'T CONTROL

197
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:54,842
EVERYTHING.

198
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:55,509
I CAN'T CONTROL WHITE HOUSE

199
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,076
DECISIONS AT THE WHITE

200
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:56,410
HOUSE.

201
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,978
I DO THINK IT WAS

202
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:58,679
INAPPROPRIATELY SAID.

203
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,481
I DO THINK WHERE WE CAN FIND

204
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:01,215
AGREEMENT WE SHOULD.

205
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,217
WHEN WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS

206
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:04,718
WE SHOULD TRY NOT TO MAKE

207
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,221
THEM PERSONAL IF POSSIBLE.

208
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:08,088
>> Neil: PRESIDENT MUCH MORE

209
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:08,922
CONCERNED WITH THE LEAK

210
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:09,256
ITSELF.

211
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:09,957
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT.

212
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:11,058
>> WELL, IT IS IMPORTANT

213
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:12,392
THAT YOU BE ABLE TO DISCUSS

214
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,260
THINGS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

215
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,294
AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAVE

216
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,429
EVERYTHING SAID IN PUBLIC.

217
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:16,530
AND SO I THINK THEY DO HAVE

218
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,397
A PROBLEM WITH THE WHITE

219
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,334
HOUSE WITH LEAKS.

220
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,870
BUT I THINK BOTH THE

221
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,338
INSULTING NATURE OF WHAT WAS

222
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:26,707
SAID AND THE LEAK.

223
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:27,307
>> Neil: PUSHING DONALD

224
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,375
TRUMP'S BUDGET PLAN, IS IT

225
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,409
YOUR CONCERN HERE NO MATTER

226
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:31,311
WHAT YOU DO, THEY WILL JUST

227
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:32,913
KEEP SPENDING WILLY-NILLY?

228
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:37,384
>> REPUBLICANS SAY THEY ARE

229
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:38,519
CONSERVATIVE THEY SAY AND

230
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,053
VOTE FOR BALANCED AMENDMENTS

231
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,523
AND DO THE OPPOSITE VOTE TO

232
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:43,590
BUST THE BUDGET CAPS AND

233
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,825
GIVE US MORE DEBT.

234
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:45,993
I'M PUTTING FORWARD A

235
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:47,060
BALANCED BUDGET IN FIVE

236
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,361
YEARS.

237
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:48,495
CALLED THE PENNY PLAN.

238
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:49,863
CUT ONE PENNY OF EVERY

239
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:50,197
DOLLAR.

240
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:51,431
THIS SEX SEEDINGLY POPULAR

241
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:52,499
WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

242
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,368
IT'S WHAT WE SAY WE ARE FOR.

243
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,335
GIVE SENATORS ON THURSDAY A

244
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,503
CHANCE TO VOTE ON THIS.

245
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,205
IT WILL BE A PRIVILEGE VOTE.

246
00:05:58,205 --> 00:05:59,540
I WILL GET A VOTE AND

247
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,574
CONSERVATIVES WILL BE PUT ON

248
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:01,508
RECORD WHETHER THEY ARE

249
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:02,809
REALLY CONSERVATIVE OR NOT.

250
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:03,343
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

251
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,945
IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

252
00:06:04,945 --> 00:00:00,000
I WANT TO HAVE YOU BACK AND
