Christmas moderate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say the least one</font>

haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually started it yet this is</font>

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,550
a bad because I normally like to get

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,140
things ready organized but because i

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,300
work in retail I don't want to spend all

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,700
my free time in retail<font color="#CCCCCC"> too if you could</font>

17

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,840
Christmas Day whenever we do the pinata

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,270
that's what I like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am because it's</font>

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">just fun and loud and I was seeing and</font>

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,260
it's just there's normally Christmas Eve

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,510
and that's like one of my favorite parts

27
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">for when does your family put up your</font>

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,989
christmas tree and who decorates it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">first receber and never before them and</font>

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,310
we've all decorated it together and it's

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,420
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it was pretty much the same</font>

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">here we got it very post the beginning</font>

35
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">of december and we all decorate it you</font>

36
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,760
know everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes part in it and</font>

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,750
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

38
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">christmas trees are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing that i</font>

39
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,350
do actually get quite happy about

40
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,560
because it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it you know</font>

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though it's environmentally</font>

42
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,549
destructive on so many levels it just

43
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,130
smells so nice and it's just this nice

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,400
like tree of light and i like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,770
like imagery of light I think light is

46
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,689
very helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very nourishing white</font>

47
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,790
lights or colored lights I'm always a

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,619
white lights go although I do like I

49
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,180
tree at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> which has a mix of</font>

50
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,310
white light and<font color="#E5E5E5"> colored light but no I</font>

51
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like a big bright white</font>

52
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,409
lights because I feel like the color can

53
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,180
be a bit too distracting I like things

54
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,130
quite simple like my whole room is very

55
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,740
very white and very simple six are you

56
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,479
guilty at picking out your presence or

57
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,950
do you like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise I don't think</font>

58
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've ever picked at my presence as far</font>

59
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,479
as i know and i generally really really

60
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,540
like the surprise and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just don't think</font>

61
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,300
there's much point in peeking because it

62
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,739
ruins the surprise and it really is a

63
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,360
surprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the past as well there's</font>

64
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,500
like waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

65
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,480
would you rather live in a gingerbread

66
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,210
house or Santa's workshop a gingerbread

67
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,070
house because it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more fun</font>

68
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,540
than a sweatshop well they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

69
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,520
get quite soggy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rain tell us</font>

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,340
your christmas eve tradition sometimes

71
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:33,150
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my sisters two seconds yeh meri</font>

72
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,610
got a package sometimes me and my

73
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,490
sisters will go to the pub with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some one</font>

74
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,680
of my sister's friends sometimes we'll

75
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,900
have a big thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pinata</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will do</font>

76
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,550
the not sure whether we don't really

77
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,660
have something that we do every year

78
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,640
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always just nice to get gas side</font>

79
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,580
it's never a day of like being lazy

80
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,350
inside it's always there's always

81
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,180
something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do you have to be</font>

82
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,010
proactive on Christmas Eve I think it's

83
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice to be social as well it's really</font>

84
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice to see other people who aren't your</font>

85
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,959
family and yet do crisp see things with

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,980
them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of the last</font>

87
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,600
chance to do that next<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was</font>

88
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,030
enough like<font color="#CCCCCC"> my space service if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
