sometimes you have to bend the truth a little at a job interrview dishonest perhaps but does it work yoyo massive lies about employment history education or your abilities are never okay but everyone's exaggerated or told half-truths in a job interview it's fine just ask the guy who hired me what according to Peter Harris editor-in-chief of the online job board work apple√≠s here are a few that are acceptable in certain situations I only worked at these places if you work somewhere for a short period of time and it ended badly just leave it up your resume your resume doesn't have to be a comprehensive list of every dumb job you've had I loved everyone on my old team everyone has to work with people they don't like however Harris said speaking ill of your former coworkers just makes you sound like a complainer my interests include traveling and reading and charity work well one of my top current interests right now avoiding social situations being jealous of my peers and anxiously checking my phone every thirty seconds probably not the best thing to tell a potential employer maybe pick interests that could positively relate to the position you're going for my last boss was the greatest of course they weren't they were your boss but putting them on blast to a potential new boss will only make them wonder if you'll say the same things about them I'm considering leaving my current job because this opportunity seems too great to pass up the real reason you leave a job is because of the people the work the commute the money or all of those things but don't say that Harris said to tell them you're excited by the opportunity at that company or you're passionate to work for them specifically you know something like that my greatest weakness is I hate when they ask for this I think it's just a mess with people never say your actual greatest weakness making videos share a weakness that wouldn't affect your ability to do the job you're applying for if you get caught lying be an adult and apologize if they really hate you about it have them tweet to me but make sure they use the hashtag why did I listen to Joe Avella you
