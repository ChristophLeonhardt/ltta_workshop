“Hello, and welcome to
‘Internetting After Dark.’
If you don’t know
by now, I’m Amanda.”
“I’m Shane.”
“And we’re here to give you a
closer look inside the making
of ‘Internetting
With Amanda Hess.’”
“Should we get started?”
“Mm, O.K.
So we released a
video about the dark side
of the male fitness
internet starring Zyzz,
legendary bodybuilder,
may he rest in peace.
And I heard from a
lot of Zyzz’s fans.
This is what they
had to say.”
“‘Mirin’
‘You mirin brah?’
‘You mirin’
‘Yeah u mirin’
‘U mirin?’
So, Amanda?”
“I just want to say to all
of you that I am ‘mirin.”
“Jessica Hoss on YouTube wrote,
‘This was a waste of a video.
How are you going to talk
about Zyzz and the dark side
of men’s fitness online,
without talking
about steroids?’”
“So that’s a great
point, and it’s something
that we thought a little
bit about while we
were making the video.
We wanted to be
really careful not
to draw an association
between someone and something
that had not been confirmed
by the guy himself,
or by a doctor,
or the coroner.
I think maybe we were a
little bit too careful.
Like, we could
have figured out
a way to mention that this is
a phenomenon in this space
without specifically saying
that anyone in particular
had used steroids.
So that’s a great point, and
thanks for bringing it up.
My favorite comment
on this video
came from
John Paul Sylvester.”
“‘Meal one.
Mea lone.
Me alone.’”
“Beautiful.”
“In our last batch, we had a
video about online mysticism.
We got a lot of comments on
this video, and a lot of them
were just people shouting
out their astrological signs.
And that Gemini Cancer Cusp
is Joshua Chance,
who also said:
‘Y’all should do the
dark side of this,
the become a
living god website,
those guys are absurd.’”
“We’re going to just show
you a clip of the home screen
video for this website,
because it’s amazing.”
“It’s really good.”
“Over the last
two decades, I’ve mastered
the god-like powers
of divination, evocation,
soul travel and energy work.
But I’m not special.
You can do it, too.”
“Thank you, Joshua Chance,
because I had never
heard of the Become a
Living God website,
and it is quite a great
rabbit hole to go down.”
“Yeah.”
“Rhys wrote, ‘I
find that people
who complain about
astrology only
have the most superficial
knowledge of it
and wouldn’t know
the difference
between zodiacal
releasing technique
and an annual profection.”
“I do not know the difference
between those things,
although I did some
YouTube investigation to try
to find out what they are.
I kind of feel like it’s a
little bit like Scientology,
though, where
like the more you
know about it
doesn’t necessarily
mean that you have a better
perspective on whether it’s
a real thing.”
“: These
eggs are on fire.
Oh —”
“We have news
about jade eggs.
So, Goop has to pay
$145,000 thanks to a
consumer protection lawsuit
in California
that found that the
claims that they
were making about
their vagina eggs
were not based in fact.
Goop said that
its vaginal eggs
would increase vaginal
muscle tone, hormonal balance
and feminine energy
in general.
In fact, they do
not do those things.
So, if you bought
an egg from Goop,
you can get a refund by
calling 1-844-WTF-GOOP.
Should we call it?”
“We were so
unprepared for that.”
“We made a video
about unboxing.”
“Comment from Jen
in San Francisco:
‘My 7 year old loves
unboxing videos,
and their kissing cousin,
the doll makeover.’”
“This is funny because,
when I was a kid,
the only two things I would
do with my Barbies was,
like, cut off all of
their hair and make them
do sex do with each other.”
“Of course.”
“So it’s interesting that
the first one of those things
has created its own genre.
I’m happy with the second one
just staying in the playroom.
That brings us to my
favorite comment, I think,
that has been made
about any of the
‘Internetting’ videos, ever.”
“Forgive my terrible
Spanish skills.
Luisa Layza on Twitter wrote:
‘El striptease de las cosas,’
which translates to the
striptease of things.”
“Thank you.”
“It’s fantastic.
You won.
You won.”
“Shane, does Wanda
ever go into boxes.”
“Wanda’s in her twilight years,
I’m sad to say.
But she does — she
does like boxes.
Should we get
a word from her?
Hi, Wanda.”
“Hi, Wanda.”
“Wanda, what do you think
about the phenomenon
of unboxing videos
on the internet?”
“I don’t think
she’s watching it.”
“Thanks, Wanda.”
“Bye.”
“I love you.
What is the best thing you saw
on the internet this week?”
“So, the real highlight of my
week on the internet is all
of the YouTube videos that
Shane sends me in the course
of making ‘Internetting.’
We’ve created a little
montage of them for you,
so please enjoy.”
“Dad?”
“: Moo —”
“: Everybody seems
seems so famous.”
“Johnny, Johnny —”
“Yes, papa.”
“I actually have a toe thumb.”
“Broom, broom.”
“: Milk.”
“Anyway, thank you
for watching.
That’s it for this episode.
Please tune in
next week, when we
are going to have a whole
episode about
YouTube babies.”
“And, as ever, if you have
a comment, or a question
or want to say
anything else related
to ‘Internetting,’ just
leave a comment right here.”
“Bye.”
“: ‘Internetting’
With Amanda Hess’ —
after dark.”
