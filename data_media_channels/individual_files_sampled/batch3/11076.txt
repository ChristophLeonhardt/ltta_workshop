get the thoughts of Oliver miles the former UK ambassador to Libya hi mr. miles thank you for your time so Prime Minister may said diplomacy didn't work she had to act but the question still is why did she have to act so quickly do you think why didn't she go to Parliament to get approval well I don't know the answer to that question and I don't think her answers to it have been very convincing my own opinion is that before launching an operation of this kind you have to pass three tests the first is is it legal the second is is it effective or the third is what are the political consequences now in this particular case because the operation seems to be carried out very cleanly and there are no reports of serious collateral damage or many casualties I think the political consequences are acceptable whether it was effective or not depends on what what you think was the objective and now we could come back to that if you like but I think it fails on the first test because I don't think it's legal I think that what the Prime Minister and the government and the other governments concerned have failed to address is that the charter of the United Nations is very clear that military action of this kind can only be undertaken in two circumstances either in self-defense which clearly this was not or with the authority of the Security Council which they did not have maybe she thought it was strength in numbers that it looked like France was going to go ahead with it in the same kind of way and and America as well who knows but how would you assess the UK government's claims that there was indeed a humanitarian basis for this intervention well of course the humanitarian situation in Syria is horrible and and anything that can be done to ease the sufferings of the Syrian people should be done but the chemical warfare element in this is relatively small their enormous numbers of casualties have been caused by the war a very very few of those have been even alleged to be involved in in chemical warfare so I think if we're going to talk about the humanitarian problem we have to take a broader view again she wasn't able to provide I don't know how you would provide this any concrete evidence of why she did what she did at the weekend to Parliament crucially you'd hope she could bring some rabbit out the Hat on that one by now wouldn't you well I don't think no I there I'm sympathetic to the Prime Minister's position that you of course we don't have absolute proof such as it wouldn't be demanded in a court of law that the Syrian regime were responsible for this for a chemical attack in this particular case but you very rarely do have absolute proof in international affairs you have to operate on something less than absolute proof and so I don't criticize the government on that's cool do you think this is the slippery end of the wedge if you like we're gonna see more of this kind of thing in the future well that's the worry of course because the the the government and the other governments concerned have stressed very rightly the importance of strengthening the the taboo on on use of chemical weapons they're determined that chemical weapons shouldn't become accepted as part of of legitimate warfare and we must all sympathize with that I'm sure everybody would agree that that's not a legitimate objective but the trouble is that in pursuing that objective they've weakened the the inhibition the the ban on aggressive war because what has laid down in the United Nations Charter is quite straightforward as I've already explained and hasn't been taken into account mr. miles thank you for time Oliver miles for me you can bastards Olivia live an hour to international appreciative
