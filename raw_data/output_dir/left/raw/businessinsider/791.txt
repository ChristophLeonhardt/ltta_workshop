1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think organizations work well when</font>

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,609
they have a leader that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a vision to</font>

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,039
take that organization to a better place

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,130
and then you have followers in that

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,590
organization that buy-in now if the

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,960
leader gets off track why are the

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,850
followers blindly following they

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,890
shouldn't and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are leaders within</font>

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,189
the followers followers right and

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,269
somebody should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have said something not</font>

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,890
just in that but in so many things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,240
know Wells Fargo there's a perfect

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,519
example of opening phony accounts now

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,630
there were people inside that

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization that complained but the</font>

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,160
managers didn't listen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think what</font>

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,700
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is realize that the values</font>

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,149
matter that the virtues good not look

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,250
I'm anybody who talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kinds</font>

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,010
of things can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be hoisted on their own</font>

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,829
self righteous petard that's it you can

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,850
google that here's here's the thing

23
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,920
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all hypocrites we all say one</font>

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,840
thing and do another but why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we</font>

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to do what we say more than what we</font>

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,479
don't and so when I look at United I see

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,180
a breakdown threw out that company but

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,460
not just a guy at the top but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,020
also the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were there that day</font>

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,520
saying you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the way to</font>

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,280
treat a human being my wife says that

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,810
the problem is John when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask people</font>

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak up and they have mortgages and</font>

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,479
kids it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough and it is tough but</font>

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,159
maybe that's why the managers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaders within an organization need to</font>

37
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,540
stand up and the reason why this wind

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,549
viral is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people feel like nobody</font>

39
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,049
cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them right oh I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

40
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,549
passenger on a plane I'm a widget

41
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,720
they're going to yank me off you know

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,790
and people are now saying wait a minute

43
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,159
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> right see there is a growing</font>

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,369
sense in this country that this being

45
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,670
disconnected is not good and there's

46
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,320
also some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are staying in</font>

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,000
their silos who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to come out</font>

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,360
but we have to pull them out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

49
00:01:54,360 --> 00:00:00,000
to pull ourselves together again
