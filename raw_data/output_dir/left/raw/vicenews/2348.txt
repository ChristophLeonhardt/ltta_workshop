1
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,823
Tell me when you guys are ready.

2
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:26,235
We announced we were going to be talking to
you.

3
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,140
Yeah.

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,261
And we said on the internet send us some
questions.

5
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:31,880
Right.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,440
Because we want to have a dialogue.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,223
Yeah.
And we'll ask the president.

8
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:38,470
And the internet blew up.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,750
It was incredible.

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,240
I do a lot of environmental pieces and
whenever I do an environmental piece,

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
out come the box, out come the eggs, you
know on Twitter.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,290
Right.

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,250
Because there's all kinds of negative
stuff-.

14
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,060
That they want to caused up.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,140
That's every day for you.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,960
Yeah.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,740
How do you do it?

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,570
How do you handle the, the controversy,
the negativity?

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,450
Yeah.

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,610
Why be pres-, it's, are you a masochist?

21
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:06,330
You know, l, l, let me tell you, this is a
fun job.

22
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,150
Right.
I, every day I wake up and

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,820
I get a bird's eye view on what's going on
everywhere in the world.

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,900
Hm.

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,240
I can have as much of an impact

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,360
on the things that are important to people
as anybody on the planet?

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,460
Right.
You know,

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,850
if you're applying yourself steadily every
single day to

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,200
the job and you're keeping your North Star
which is,

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,780
when I leave this office I want things to
be a little bit better.

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,550
Then the day to day criticism, the
chatter,

32
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,380
the noise, is something that you end up
blocking out.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,880
And the longer you're in the job the more
you're likely to take the long view.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,203
Let's take something like climate change.

35
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:54,140
Let's.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,980
We just got back from Antarctica and
Antarctica is melting,

37
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,720
Greenland is melting as fast as they can.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,120
Sea levels are rising, yet many people are
putting their head in the sand.

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,750
It's right over the hill, Shane.

40
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,710
Yeah.
Pine Island and

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,090
Thwaites are right over the hill, 100
miles from here.

42
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,990
Yeah.

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,120
All that ice, it's just a matter of time,
is going to fall down to sea.

44
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,185
If I can change how the country thinks
about this.

45
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:24,240
Mm-hm.
As, as a serious, immediate threat.

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,660
Not some distant vague thing.

47
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,660
Which is crucial.

48
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,650
If I can encourage and gain commitments
from the Chinese

49
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,440
to put forward a serious plan to start
curbing their greenhouse gases.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,600
And that then allows us to leverage the
entire world for

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,680
the conference that will be taking this
place this year in, in Paris.

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,090
And if I'm able to double fuel efficiency
standards, and if I'm able to

53
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,570
make appliances more efficient, and to
double the production of clean energy.

54
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,510
If I'm able to do all those things now,
when I'm done.

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,730
We're still going to have a heck of a
problem, but

56
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,200
we will have made enough progress that,
the next president and

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,980
the next generations can start building on
it, you start getting some momentum.

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,065
Which is rational, sane
That's a great answer,

59
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,178
however
Yeah.

60
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:16,620
You have people.

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,110
For example Senator Inhofe whose whose
throwing snowballs,

62
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,240
whose saying the greatest hoax perpetrated
on the American

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,140
public is that we can do anything about
climate change or that it's even real.

64
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,350
Senator from Oklahoma.

65
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,360
We keep hearing that 2014 has been the
warmest year on record.

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,410
I asked the chair, do you know what this
is?

67
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,530
It's a snowball.

68
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,980
And, that's just from outside here.

69
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,170
So it's very, very cold out.

70
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,130
Very unseasonal.

71
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,490
So here Mr. President, catch this.

72
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,740
Throwing a snowball would be funny-
Yeah.

73
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,280
If it weren't for

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,940
the fact that he's chairman of the Senate
committee on the environment.

75
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,120
That's disturbing.

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,250
So you have a very sane and rational plan,
but

77
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,380
we're not acting in a sane and rational
way.

78
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,240
Yeah.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,310
Well I, and I, I, I'll tell you.

80
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:10,240
Climate change is an example of the
hardest problems to solve,

81
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,590
the hardest thing to do in politics and in
government is to make

82
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,740
sacrifices now for a long term payoff.

83
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,520
But here's, here's what keeps me
optimistic.

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,505
Is, you talk to Malia and Sasha, you know?

85
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:26,605
Mm-hm.
16 and 13.

86
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:27,570
Mm-hm.

87
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,300
And the sophistication and awareness that
they have about environmental issues,

88
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,170
compared to my generation or yours.

89
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah.

90
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,680
They're way ahead of the game.

91
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,560
There's always gonna be resistance to
change.

92
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,880
And some of that is gonna be generational.

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,470
I guarantee you that the Republican party
will have to change it's approach

94
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,420
to climate change, because voters will
insist upon it.

95
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,730
The challenge on something like climate
change is,

96
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,645
there comes a point of no return.

97
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:57,640
Mm-hm.

98
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,140
And you do have to make sure that we get
at this thing quick enough and

99
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,380
with enough force, to be able to make a
difference.

100
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,870
Why is the resistance so strong?

101
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,930
Well some of it's economic.

102
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,500
If you poll folks, they're concerned about
climate change.

103
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,600
But they're more concerned about gas
prices.

104
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
Right.

105
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,000
You can't fault somebody for being
concerned about paying the bills or

106
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,940
being able to fill up your tank to get to
your job.

107
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,800
In some cases, though, you have elected
officials who are shills for

108
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,270
the oil companies or the fossil fuel
industry.

109
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,300
And there's a lot of money involved.

110
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,430
Typically in Congress the committees of
jurisdiction, like the energy committees,

111
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,340
are populated by folks from places that
pump a lot of oil and pump a lot of gas.

112
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,820
In our research the environment or

113
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,210
global warming is the number one issue
for, for Gen Y.

114
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,860
But another issue is dysfunction.

115
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,450
Yeah.
You know,

116
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,240
it seems that from the outside that.

117
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,320
From the inside too.

118
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,970
That Washington, if you look at global
warming for example.

119
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,640
Yeah.

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,970
And you're right, the younger generation,
there is no debate.

121
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,980
Yeah.

122
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,520
Yet they see.

123
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,780
This fighting, this gridlock in-
Yeah.

124
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,780
In Washington.

125
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,540
Or for other things.

126
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,615
Just for example, now sort of chicken
that's being played

127
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:25,130
with Department of Homeland Security for
example.

128
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,610
Republicans are playing politics with the
critical funding.

129
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,015
For the Department of Homeland Security
and threatening a shut down.

130
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:40,470
The President's executive amnesty is
lawless and unconstitutional.

131
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,766
These are things that our taxes pay for.

132
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:44,458
Right.
Yet

133
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:48,410
it seems to be a game that's being played.

134
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:54,430
And young people are dissatisfied and
angry, but they don't know what to do.

135
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,725
What would you, what would you tell them?

136
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,730
Well, let me say a couple things.

137
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,210
A lot of times, from the outside, and
sometimes mainstream media reports this

138
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,910
as a food fight, and it's a problem of
both parties just being partisan.

139
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,345
Well, that's just not accurate.

140
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:18,383
On climate change, 90% of Democrats agree
with me and

141
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:24,990
90% of Republicans oppose any action on
it.

142
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,800
And a sizable portion of their party deny
it even exists.

143
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,175
There have been times in history where
Democrats have been unreasonable.

144
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,963
Mm.
There have been times where

145
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,640
Republicans have led the way.

146
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,480
But right now, on a lot of the issues that
young people care about,

147
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,345
it's not both sides arguing and creating
gridlock.

148
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:47,730
You've got one side that is denying the
facts.

149
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,490
Mm.
Who are often motivated, principally,

150
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,135
by opposing whatever it is that I propose.

151
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:57,560
Now, that's not inevitable to our
democracy.

152
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,180
That's some,

153
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,820
that's a phase that the Republican Party's
going through right now.

154
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,440
And it'll outgrow that phase.

155
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,780
The thing that we do have to worry about
is the fact that

156
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,860
the pace of change globally is so quick.

157
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,430
Mm.
That we may not have the luxury

158
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,985
of 20 years or ten years of not getting a
lot done.

159
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,290
Mm-hm.

160
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,920
If we want to deal with not just climate
change but the potential for a pandemic.

161
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,550
With terrorism, with the challenges around
cyber security.

162
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,320
Some of these things are just moving.

163
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,640
One thing young people could do

164
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
immediately-
Yes.

165
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,620
Is vote.
Okay.

166
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,489
And the fact of the matter is, is that in
the last midterm election,

167
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,055
about a third of eligible voters voted.

168
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:42,990
Mm-hm.

169
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,263
And so, if you've got gridlock and you've
got people who aren't producing,

170
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:50,386
the fact that a lot of them got rewarded
with reelection and

171
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:54,021
the people who were in power creating the
gridlock stayed in power,

172
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:58,190
that's the consequence of everybody
staying home and acting cynical.

173
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,133
And the minute you withdraw in that way
from the process of politics,

174
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:11,418
well, then you're destined to have the
existing power structures call the shots.

175
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:16,193
47 Republican senators put their names
today to this open letter to Iran

176
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:21,428
informing Iran that any nuclear agreement
not voted in by Congress will be viewed

177
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:26,818
as, quote, nothing more than an executive
agreement between President Obama and

178
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,050
Ayatollah Khamenei.

179
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,710
How does it feel when you're trying to get
a deal done with Iran,

180
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,130
for example, and then you have senators
who are sending separate letters?

181
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,940
Yeah.
Well, it I'm embarrassed for them.

182
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,210
Yeah.

183
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,955
Because it's not how America does
business.

184
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,040
Mm-hm.

185
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,150
I think it's entirely legitimate for

186
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,640
my friends in the Senate who signed that
letter to ask very

187
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,340
hard questions about how can we assure
that Iran's not getting a nuclear weapon.

188
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,130
You know, why would we lift sanctions now
given

189
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,310
how they're causing problems in other part
of the world.

190
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,210
Given the venomous things they've said
about Israel.

191
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,605
You know, how can we even negotiate with
them?

192
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,578
Now, I will have responses to each of
those questions, and

193
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:19,990
I will say that I've committed to making
sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.

194
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm prepared to take all options to
prevent them from getting a nuclear

195
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,970
weapon, but the absolute best option is a
diplomatic resolution.

196
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,110
And if we do get a deal, it's going to be
because I can verify that they won't have

197
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,530
a weapon and I will have the international
community helping us verify that.

198
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,620
We can have that debate.

199
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,170
For them to address a letter to the
Ayatollah,

200
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,110
the supreme leader of Iran, who they claim
is our mortal enemy, and

201
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,810
their basic argument to them is, don't
deal with our president,

202
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,380
because you can't trust him to follow through
on an agreement.

203
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,330
That's close to unprecedented.

204
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,190
Mm-hm.
We were

205
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,260
looking at the history to see if there was
an example of it.

206
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,830
We couldn't find one.

207
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,880
And by doing so, they were effectively
making common cause with the hardliners in

208
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,805
Iran who also don't want any kind of
diplomatic resolution,

209
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,595
because they are invested in getting a nuclear
weapon.

210
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:20,140
Mm-hm.

211
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,320
So this is a good example, I think, of
where the state of our politics.

212
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,065
Sure.
That leads Republicans to be more worried

213
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:33,250
about a Tea Party primary than they are
about what ordinary folks are thinking.

214
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,860
It damages the country, it damages our
standing, it's not productive.

215
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,600
In this day and age where we've got such
big issues, we can't afford it.

216
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,950
We embedded with ISIL last summer for a
month.

217
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,640
One of the biggest questions that I had
was, how did they become so

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,310
popular so fast?

219
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,845
How did they get so many foreign fighters
from America, from the UK-.

220
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,778
Mm-hm.
You know, from Scandinavia,

221
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:14,310
from all over the world, go there,
outstrip al-Qaeda almost overnight?

222
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,380
Yeah.

223
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,316
And so, A, how did they become so popular
out of nowhere?

224
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:23,318
And then, B, how do we stop them?

225
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:24,290
Two things.

226
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,456
One is ISIL is a direct outgrowth of
Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

227
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:29,996
Mm-hm.

228
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,630
That grew out of our invasion.

229
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,480
Which is an example of unintended
consequences,

230
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,970
which is why we should generally aim
before we shoot.

231
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,740
We've got a 60 country coalition.

232
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:49,003
We will slowly push back ISIL out of Iraq.

233
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:51,010
I'm confident that will happen.

234
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,605
But what I'm worried about, and

235
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:58,795
what we have to stay worried about, is,
even if ISIL is defeated,

236
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:03,891
the underlying problem of disaffected
Sunnis around the world,

237
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:10,118
but particularly in some of these areas,
including Libya, including Yemen.

238
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:14,295
Where a young man who's growing up, has no
education and

239
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,473
has no prospects for the future, is
looking around, and

240
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:24,235
the one way that he can get validation,
power, respect as if he's a fighter.

241
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:28,076
And this looks like the toughest gang
around, so let me affiliate with them.

242
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,331
Mm-hm.

243
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:36,198
And now you're giving me a, a religious
rationale for doing this.

244
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:40,398
That's a problem we're gonna have, have
generally and

245
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:44,600
we can't keep on thinking about
counter-terrorism and

246
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,310
security as entirely separate from
diplomacy, development, education.

247
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,860
All these things that are considered soft,
but

248
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,300
in fact, are vital to our national
security.

249
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,430
And we do not fund those.

250
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,080
If you asked the average person, how much
do we spend on foreign aid?

251
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,110
They'll say, 25% of the federal budget.

252
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,770
Right.

253
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,835
Well it's a little over 1%.

254
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,570
Mm-hm.

255
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,700
We should be thinking about making
investments there

256
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,140
that ultimately save us from having to
send our young men and women

257
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,110
to fight or having folks come here and,
and doing great harm.

258
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,930
This is the last question.

259
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,330
All right.
Our number one question

260
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,190
from everyone on the Internet.

261
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,100
Yeah.

262
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,820
Was, and this might seem flippant, but
with the War on Drugs.

263
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,740
Yeah.
With too many people in prisons,

264
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,940
like we said, it's hurting education.

265
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,180
Right.

266
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,850
States are legalizing marijuana.

267
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,830
Right.

268
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,590
It seems like an inevitability.

269
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,620
I declare this war over.

270
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,120
We're ending a failed policy of
prohibition.

271
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,450
For young people, I'm sorry, but if you
legalize marijuana,

272
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,120
it would be the biggest part of your
legacy.

273
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,631
So what are your thoughts on that?

274
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:01,920
Well first of all, it shouldn't be young
people's biggest priority.

275
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,900
Right.
The.

276
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,608
It was our, it was our, it was our most
popular.

277
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:08,208
I, I, no I understand 'cause, 'cause sometimes
on the, the White House website and

278
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:11,100
petitions you know we get the same.

279
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,110
So let's put it in perspective, young
people I understand this is

280
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,940
important to you but, you know, you should
be thinking about climate change.

281
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,470
Right.

282
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,370
The economy, jobs, war and peace.

283
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,800
Maybe way at the bottom you should be
thinking about marijuana.

284
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,990
I, I'd separate out the issue of
decriminalization

285
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,750
of marijuana from encouraging its use.

286
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,560
I think there is no doubt that our
criminal justice system generally is so

287
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,846
heavily skewed towards cracking down on
non-violent drug offenders.

288
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:48,310
Mm-hm.
That, it has not just had a,

289
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,660
a terrible effect on, many communities,
particularly communities of color.

290
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,270
Rendering a lot of folks unemployable,
because they got felony records.

291
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,170
Disproportionate prison sentences.

292
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,850
It costs a huge amount of money to states,
and

293
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,130
a lot of states are staring to figure that
out.

294
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,090
But, what I'm encouraged by is,

295
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:15,640
you're starting to see, not just liberal
Democrats, but also some con-,

296
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,940
very conservative Republicans recognize
this doesn't make sense.

297
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,540
Including sort of the Libertarian wing of
the Republican party.

298
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,050
And they see the money in it.

299
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,600
And they see the money and, and how costly
it is to incarcerate.

300
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,280
So, we may actually be able to make some
progress on the decriminalization side.

301
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,020
At a certain point if enough states, end
up,

302
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:45,450
decriminalizing, then Congress may then,
you know, reschedule marijuana.

303
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:45,990
Mm-hm.

304
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,890
And I always say to folks, you know,
legalization or

305
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,090
decriminalization is not a panacea.

306
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,745
Do you feel the same way about meth?

307
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:54,560
Mm-hm.

308
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,960
Do we feel the same way about coke?

309
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,970
How about crack?

310
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,300
How about heroin?

311
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,050
And, and, and, there is a legitimate, I
think, concern about the overall effects

312
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,719
this has on society and, and particularly
vulnerable parts of our society.

313
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,560
Substance abuse, generally legal and
illegal substances, is a problem.

314
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,889
Locking somebody up for 20 years is
probably not the best strategy.

315
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,205
And that's something that we have to re,
rethink as society as a whole.

316
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,184
Mr. President, I'd like to thank you for
your time today and

317
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:31,425
I'd like to thank you for coming here and
talking about, young issues or issues for

318
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:33,798
young people as well as being with the
students.

319
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:34,658
I had a great time.

320
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:36,276
Thank you.

321
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:38,740
All right, we got it.

322
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,040
Thanks, Mr. President.

323
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,015
Appreciate it, man.

324
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,545
Do you guys want to take a picture with
the crew before I get out of here?

325
00:17:43,585 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, guys.
