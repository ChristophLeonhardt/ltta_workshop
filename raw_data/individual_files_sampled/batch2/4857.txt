you and I worked in a white house can you imagine and to me one of those interesting things about the Saturday New York Times story was it dumb again refers to the President as King Kong you know this is not someone who seems to respect the commander-in-chief for whom he works so if you had to go and who you worked in a White House go inside what you think dama ganas White House Council for all of these crises might have shared with Bob Miller I believe that dama can pull Bob Miller the truth the whole truth and nothing but what does that include it means that every single thing that Don McGann has seen has heard has been a witness to he told Special Counsel I was next door to DOM again at the National Republican Congressional Committee he was my next-door neighbor I've known Don for years I like Tom again Tom began is a good lawyer he is a careful lawyer Don began is not getting disbarred we're going to jail for Donald Trump so I guarantee you and I bet my life on it Don began answered every question directly with maximum knowledge whether it incriminated the president or not and what the Trump people don't understand is this he's not the president's personal attorney he is the White House Counsel he is an assistant to the president he is a commissioned officer he doesn't work for Donald Trump he works for us he works for the American people he's sworn oath to preserve protect and defend the Constitution in much the same way that Donald Trump did that's what his obligation is it's not to lie for the president it's to tell the truth to the special counsel on behalf of the American people and who's for whom he works and serve hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
