actress jessica drake says that stormy Daniels told her twice that she was threatened by someone to stay silent about Donald Trump she actually told me about the threat twice so the first time she told me about the threat was shortly after it happened she relayed the experience to me I said something like I'm so sorry I can't even imagine what are you going to do and then says Jessica Drake stormy Daniels told her about the threat again during the presidential campaign when Jessica Drake became one of the women who went public with her own accusations about Donald Trump just remember what I told you about all those years ago she goes be careful be really careful you know don't be alone an interview with I remember tonight Jessica Drake repeated some of what she said during the presidential campaign about her own experience with Donald Trump and you say point-blank he offered you money for sex Roger was made I'm I took it as if it was for sex because the calls that came prior to that were mr. Trump wants you to join him in his hotel room and then when I was speaking to mr. Trump himself on the phone he asked me come on come on up what do you want how much and then the numbers started to come during the presidential campaign Donald Trump lumped Jessica Drake in with all the other women who made accusations about him during the campaign and he called them all liars something he has never done with stormy Daniels Donald Trump has never denied anything that storming Daniels has said about him not one word the Washington Post has reported that Keith Davidson the attorney who represented stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in negotiating non-disclosure agreements with Donald Trump is cooperating with the federal investigation of Michael Cohen the lawyer who represented Donald Trump in those same negotiations a spokesperson for Keith Davidson said quote he has done so he will continue to cooperate to the fullest extent possible under the law today the white house was occupied by questions about tweets from the president this weekend attacking a New York Times story that said the White House was worried about Michael Cohen flipping and becoming a witness against Donald Trump what is he worried good I think he said even in that that there isn't anything there for that to happen why not tweet that then why open the opportunity for him to flip it suggest that he has something to hide doesn't it no I don't think the president has anything to hide I think he's been quite clear on that joining the discussion now Michael avenatti the attorney for stormy Daniels and Michael I want to get your reaction to what Jessica Drake has to say in in offering corroboration for stormy Daniels telling her about the threat that she says she got from Donald Trump and I just want to add an amendment to what I just said about Donald Trump never denying anything storming just said the only thing he seems to contest is the idea that he was in any way involved in this threat to her well you're right Lawrence I mean he's never admitted anything either he's really stood behind the White House spokespeople the deputy and the and miss Sanders but you know I think miss Drake's statements further bolster my client's credibility not that she needed it quite frankly because I think that the vast majority of Americans have now seen her on to interview 60 minutes in the view they've heard the story directly from her and I think her credibility is bulletproof as to what happened in connection with this threat and what happened in connection with the relationship she had with mr. Trump in 2006 and 2007 but I want to go back to something that he just showed and that was miss Sanders outside the White House and she actually told the press corps that the tweet that the president sent this weekend had a reference to the fact that he didn't have anything to hide that's just a complete joke I mean are they actually making this up as they go along because it appears so Lawrence that tweet which I responded to and I read it and of times it said no such thing at all that's what it should have said if he was an innocent man that's what it would have said that's all it needed to say but it didn't include that statement at all the president's clearly concerned and he should be he should be panicked and it appears that he is about what Michael Cohen may do next and you've been consistent from the start that Michael Cohen as soon as you knew about the raid that Michael Cohen was going to crack Michael Cohen was going to flip you've known Michael Cohen for a matter of several weeks now and have had these dealings with him at that arm's length of lawyers but I just want to go to Jay Gould Berg who's now an 85 year old attorney in Manhattan represented Donald Trump for decades in very serious legal matters unlike what Michael Cohen dealt with and here's what Jay Goldberg told me about what he believes Michael Cohen will do and he says he told the president this also I said Michael Cohen is of the type that he's interested in protecting himself and he'll say whatever he thinks is necessary to get a deal with the government it sounds pretty bad you say Michael Cohen will turn against the president with talking with special prosecutors that says we will turn against the Donald Trump if that be his conclusion that that's what the prosecutor wants and Michael had a knowing what you do know about the shape of this case and about the shape of the Michael Cohen investigation if Michael Cohen does flip and start talking about Donald Trump what do you think could be revealed about the president and I would assume one of the things would be the number of these kinds of non-disclosure agreements he has reached with how many women over how many years well Lawrence I think that's correct and I think that's the tip of the iceberg frankly I mean you're talking about an individual that was at the right hand of Donald Trump for the better part of a decade the last ten years prior to him being elected president of the United States he knows like where all of the bodies are buried he was involved in whatever unseemly deals were done during that ten-year time period this is about the last guy that you want in the crosshairs he's the last guy that you want the FBI raiding his home his hotel room in his office in Lawrence you know I predicted on April 5th which was a Thursday it was the Thursday before the raid which occurred on the following Monday that ultimately Michael Cohen was going to be in serious trouble and was gonna flip on the president I was the first one to predict it I've had a number of predictions in this case I don't think I've been wrong yet and I'm gonna stand by my recent predictions Michael Cohen is in a very very bad spot he's in serious trouble there's no question in my view that he's gonna be indicted there's no question he's gonna roll over on the President and I'm gonna repeat what I've said I do not think the president will survive this term I think Michael Cohen knows too much I think he was too sloppy along the way I don't think he was smart and covering his tracks and I think there's going to be in a mountain of evidence that's going to be presented against mr. Trump when you say you don't believe the president will survive this term now that Michael Cohen has been rated now that the FBI has all that evidence from Michael Cowen's home office safety deposit box and so forth are you you can are you assuming that there would be criminal conduct there revealed about the president or just conduct that is politically unsurvivable and the president might resign or the president might find himself in impeachment proceedings I think the amount of heat that is going to come down on mr. Trump in connection with his personal attorney of 10 years turning on him and rolling on him will be insurmountable and I think his only exit in an effort to save whatever face he might have left at that time will be to resign the office I know a lot of people think that is a bold prediction I've made a number of bold predictions in this case thus far and I haven't been wrong and I don't think I'm gonna be wrong about this one this situation is getting worse by the day you now have mr. Goldberg who you interviewed he I think he described us I think he described on a scale of one to a hundred that Michael Cohen wasn't even a one as a related to protecting mr. Trump exactly he gives it less than a 1% chance that Michael Cohen would actually protect the president in this investigation at this stage of the investigation Michael avenatti a lot to think about there and what you about to say thank you very much once again for joining us tonight really appreciate it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
