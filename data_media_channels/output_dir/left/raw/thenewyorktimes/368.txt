1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,760
On September 15, 2017,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,120
the Cassini spacecraft will dive into Saturn,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,320
ending a 13-year tour of the ringed planet

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,320
and its strange moons.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,000
Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004,

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,400
after a seven-year journey through the solar system.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,200
Its first port of call was Titan, Saturn's largest moon.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,920
A frigid world of nitrogen smog and dark hydrocarbon lakes.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,400
Cassini released the Huygens probe to land on Titan.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,720
Parachuting through the moon's smoggy atmosphere,

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
Huygens sent back images of alien river beds

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
carved out of methane and water ice.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Our first touchdown on an alien moon.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,880
Cassini returned to Titan over a hundred times,

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,560
using the moon's gravity as a slingshot

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,520
to shift its orbit 

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,880
and weave a three-dimensional pattern through space.

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Over hundreds of flybys,

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,440
Cassini's cameras dissolved Saturn's majestic rings

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,240
into grooves and gaps, bands and braids. 

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,480
For 13 years, Cassini joined the dance of Saturn's 62 moons.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,560
Scuffed marbles chasing each other around a golden ring.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
The flattened moonlet Pan

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,120
clears a narrow track through the rings.

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,640
Potato-shaped Prometheus

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,440
carves ripples in Saturn's thin F ring.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,040
Sponge-like Hyperion

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,520
tumbles chaotically through the void.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,800
And pale Iapetus sweeps its orbit clean.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,080
A ball of ice dusted with black and ridged with mountains.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,320
But the most surprising moon of all

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,600
was Enceladus, glistening with fresh snow.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,120
Its crinkled shell hides an ocean of water

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,360
that might be hospitable to life.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,240
Geysers of salt water shoot from stretch marks near its south pole.

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,840
Cassini flew through these plumes several times.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,920
Its sensors detected promising molecules,

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,880
but they were not designed to look for life.

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,640
Are alien microbes hitching a ride in the briny spray?

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,640
It will take a future spacecraft to find that answer.

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,880
Cassini arrived at Saturn in the depths of northern winter,

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
with the north pole in darkness.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
As the planet tipped downward,

44
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,440
Saturn's seasons slowly changed.

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,600
Perfect lighting to study the north polar hurricane.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,480
A six-sided storm that could swallow four Earths.

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
Some of Cassini's orbits took it behind Saturn.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,200
An alien sunset before hours of darkness.

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,720
Looking back past Saturn's rings,

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,000
Cassini even saw the distant Earth,

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,400
a pinprick of blue light.

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,440
In April, the spacecraft swung close by Titan for the last time,

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,080
letting the moon's gravity pull it inward.

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,320
For the first of 22 dives inside Saturn's rings.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
The "Grand Finale,"

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,000
22 chances to peer at Saturn's cloud tops, study the pole

57
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,720
and look out at the rings from the inside.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,640
But Cassini's fuel is almost gone.

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,720
Its watch is ending after 20 years in space.

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,560
To keep the lakes of Titan and the snows of Enceladus

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,800
untouched by any earthly microbes,

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,040
the spacecraft must be destroyed.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,040
On September 15, Cassini will make its final dive,

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,640
piercing Saturn's clouds at over 70,000 miles an hour.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
Straining to remain upright

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,760
as it sends its final data back to Earth.

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Saturn's butterscotch clouds

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,280
will burn and scatter it into a wisp of alien atoms,

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,160
leaving nary a ruffle nor a burp to show for it.

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,160
Just a brief meteor flash.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:00:00,000
A streak of light that no eyes that we know of may ever see.
