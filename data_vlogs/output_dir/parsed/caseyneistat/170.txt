summer is the season in between spring
and fall it occurs when the Earth on its
axis tilts in the direction of the Sun
resulting in longer hotter days this
summer is 93 days 15 hours and 38
minutes long summer is short summer is
special and today is the very first day
of summer in honor of making the most
out of summer this video is going to be
me trying to live out a stupid teenage
fantasy it starts at some ridiculous
hotel in the south of France the hotel
has an amazing shower you can tell
everything you need to know about a
hotel by its shower it also involves
room service
lots of room service co-stars my friend
Jesse is a great dancer
there was this fantasy car but this this
was nice but this wasn't it the problem
with our driver's licenses because
neither a tablet so we had to get this
car instead oh all right back to the
video and the less cool far this summer
fantasy it's something like James Bond
jay-z's but again the part wasn't right
it's cut be sorry for the interruptions
in this we're taking this car back we're
losing this part we're gonna drop the
whole car scene as hard decision it's
not matching the vibe that we're doing
the colors back in play we got we got
vanilla we got Iowa heritage
next porky
see I spend the rest of the year waiting
for and wanting summer some has always
been a time when I'm in a bathing suit
all day kind of look like two dorks
some has always been magical it's never
been like this but I've always imagined
something like this that's all yeah a
guy can dream you and you're too close
and the girls are too far Tyla come on I
mean this is a hard shoot case I don't
know how we're gonna make it my favorite
favorite part of the production thus far
yeah we had a huge boat I don't think we
could make a video like this unless you
had a type of boat it's the South of
France would you expect come on this is
my childhood fantasy just go with it
now I'll be the first to recognize this
is not the most original fantasy in the
world I mean look at us we're like
wannabe rock stars who just got our
first advance but that's summer I think
summer is the will reminding us to get
outside and live a little okay you're
driving now
it's not necessarily about realizing
absurd childhood ambitions but it is
about having fun and being free to play
and enjoying every damn minute
my twelve year old self smells a lot to
learn but summer leave that without a
crazy hotel room a big boat jet skis or
that car we never drove it's about the
spirit
it's about being alive you've got to
make the most out of every moment don't
worry you can sleep in September
the time it's only 10:00 p.m. come on
come on Casey sister make the most of
every second what are you doing I'm
ready to get turnt up
I'm ready Madame red
you
