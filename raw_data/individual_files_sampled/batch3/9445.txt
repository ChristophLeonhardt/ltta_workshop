Sean: AS MUELLER'S WITCH HUNT CONTINUES, REMEMBER MARK LEVIN LAST SUMMER EXPLAINING THE DOJ POLICY THAT SAID THE SITTING PRESIDENT CANNOT BE INDICTED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE MEDIA FORGETS. IT IS THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES AND 1973 MEMRAPPEDUM UNDER THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. YOU MUST NOT AND CANNOT INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT, NOT THAT THIS PRESIDENT WOULD BE. AS A MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. 44 YEARS THAT IS THE POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE HAVE HAD LAW PROFESSOR AND HOMELESS PEOPLE ALL OVER TV AND TALKING ABOUT OBSTRUCTION. MEDIA TYPES TALKING ABOUT IT. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER. THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WE DON'T CHARGE A SITTING PRESIDENT WITH A CRIME. Sean: MARK REITERATED THAT POINT A FEW WEEKS AGO. A SITTING PRESIDENT'S IMMUNITY TO INDICTMENT AND PROSECUTION THAT WOULD UNCONSTITUTIONALLY UNDERMINE THE ASSIGNED FUNCTION. PAGE AFTER PAGE SAYING A SITTING UNITED STATES PRESIDENT CANNOT BE INDICTED. DID THEY ISSUE ANOTHER MEMO IN NIXON AND CLINTON. NO. AND THE HOST OF CRTV LEVIN TV. NUMBER ONE SHOW SUNDAY NIGHT RIGHT HERE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL AND I CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE. MARK, I WANTED TO PLAY THAT AGAIN, AS USUAL ON LEGAL MATTERS YOU ARE AHEAD OF THE CURVE AND A CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY AND OUR LAZY OVERPAID JOURNALIST ARE WRONG 99 PERCENT OF THE TIME. I WANT YOU TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THIS. THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SPEAKING AND THE POSITION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN AMENDED SINCE OCTOBER 16TH, 200. YOU HAVE A LOT OF SECOND TIER SLIP AND FALL LAWYERS ALL OVER TVP SPEWING THINGS THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTION AND HAVE NOT STUDIED THE CASES, I HAVE. FIRST OF ALL THE OPINION SAID GRAND JURY AND PROSECUTORS CANNOT SUPPLANT CONGRESS. ONLY WAY TO REMOVE A SITTING PRESIDENT IS IMPEACHMENT. THEY CANNOT DISABLE OR HAM STRING A PRESIDENCY WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO. A PROSECUTOR CANNOT TWEAK THE 23'D AMENDMENT. HE CAN'T STEP IN ANY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. A PRESIDENT CAN'T PROPERLY DEFEND HIMSELF WHEN HE HAS TIME TO SPEND ON OFFICIAL DUTIES. UNLIKE SO MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS SO UNIQUE IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM IT IS DAMAGING TO HIM, BECAUSE HE CAN'T FOCUS ON HIS DEFENSE WHICH IS DIFFERENT ON CIVIL LIT GAGDZ AND CAN'T FOCUS ON THE NATION'S SECURITY AND WELL-BEING. THE PRESIDENT CAN'T FUNCTION WITH THESE KINDS OF BURDEN. AND HE CAN'T BE INDICTED AS A SITTING PRESIDENT. PERIOD. PRESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED SUBPOENAS BEFORE. TELL ME, TELL ME ONE WHO HAS BEEN BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND JURY. KEN STARR'S TEAM SUBPEONA BILL CLINTON NOT SO MUCH FOR THE SEX OF THE INTERN, BUT LYING ABOUT LITIGATION THAT WAS TAKING PLACE. AND HE DECIDED TO DO A VIDEO. HERE IS MY ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE DIDN'T SEEK IT AND TO HIS LAWYERS. FOCUS. YOU ARE MAKING THIS TOO COMPLICATED. THE CONSTITUTION IS ON THE SIDE OF THE PRESIDENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S DECISION IS ON THE SIDE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HISTORICAL PRECEDENT IS ON THE SIDE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. STOP LISTENING TO ALL OF THE BABBLING AND PLEADING THE FIFTH AND SITTING DOWN WITH A SUBPENE A. AND I WOULD SAY TO MR. MUELLER. PRESENT US WITH AN EXPLANATION OF YOUR DEFIANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICY WHICH YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE DEPARTMENT MUCH JUSTICE AND MOREOVER WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN BURDEN A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS WHILE HE'S IN OFFICE. AND WHILE I AM AT IT. A FEW REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE ARE CONFUSED AND VOTED TO PROTECT MR. MUELLER THAN THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE POWER EVEN TO TELL THE PRESIDENT WHO HE CAN HIRE AND FIRE. PART OF THE PROBLEM OF THE PRESIDENT HE IS DEALING WITH IGNOREAMMOUS IN AND OUT OF HIS PARTY AND SOME CRESSED UP AS LAWYERS. I WOULD MAKE MUELLER AND HIS BAND OF DEMOCRAT PROSECUTORS MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE COURT COURT AND IF THEY TRY TO SUBPEONA TO APPEAR BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND JURY AND MAKE THE CASE AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. AND IF IT TAKES SIX MONTHS, SIX YEARS, BY GOD IT TAKES SIX YEARS, WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY AND SEPARATION OF POWERS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT 49 AREAS WAS
