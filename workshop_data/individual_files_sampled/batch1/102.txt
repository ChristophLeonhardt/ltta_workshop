hi I'm Alicia Belial and you're in the stream live on al-jazeera and on YouTube China's thriving economy has attracted people from all over the world not least African seeking better opportunities but many black residents and visitors have found that endemic racism has soured their experience today in the stream what it's like being black in China most people are familiar with China's lucrative economic projects in Africa from building roads and railways in Tanzania to running copper mines in Zambia but for many years Economic Opportunity has been a two-way street take the Chinese Court city of Guangzhou thousands of African business people have made it their home over the last two decades one particular quarter of a city has the nickname little Africa and is filled with export companies but recently authorities have intensified in immigration crackdown in Guangzhou leading many African migrants to reconsider their future these are rules are zealously policed and renewing residency permits is fraught with complexities many Africans in Guangzhou say the restrictions unfairly target them and that they are an extension of the overt racism they've experienced during their time in China black residents and visitors in other major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have also reported negative experiences ranging from stares and demands for photographs to unwanted touching in a recent conversation that drew hundreds of retweets and likes on Twitter Benedict taken Colo related her experiences of quote exhausting racism in China saying that she considered leaving Beijing countless times so how can China be more racially inclusive for more on this were joined from Shanghai - naysha Davis a writer and content creator she recently wrote an article for six tone that asked whether films such as Black Panther can changed Chinese attitudes towards race in Hong Kong we have a Roberto Castillo an assistant professor on the cultural studies program at Lingnan University for the last six years he's researched the experience of Africans in China particularly those living and working in Guangzhou Chen Chen Jiang is a political scientist focusing on migration and citizenship she joins us from the Danish capital Copenhagen and from the Chinese capital Beijing we have Hannah Ryder she is CEO of development to reimagine that's a consulting firm on links between China and Africa welcome to this stream everyone let's get started on Twitter with the thread that I mentioned earlier that sparked today's discussion from benedikte a graduate student in Beijing she writes let me put it this way China is not for the faint-hearted and she went on to explain what she meant in a video comment that she sent to the stream have a look being black in China has been full of ups and downs and the downs were characterized by a lot of frustrating experiences such as people touching my hair without my permission or asking me if my skin color was real or when I would tell them that I'm French they would then question me and say how can you be French French people only meant to be white and you're black so it leads to a lot of frustration not so much resentment but more like sadness because you kind of wish that people in this day and age they didn't ask such questions and you can try and explain and educate but you can't do this every single time now you said now you've been living in China for about three and a half years can you relate to Benedictus experience absolutely so many times you know I've had experiences like that where you know my nationality is being called into question and you know there's microaggressions and you know just a lot of different things that come up that are race related you know like on a daily basis and it kind of becomes frustrating because you're just trying to live your everyday life I understand that I am different and this is a different experience for both of us but everything can't be a teachable moment can you give us an example is there something in mind that comes to mind I know you told our producers about one experience that kind of stuck with me and it's when you were in a cosmetic store that's an international chain based here in the US but it's also in China this was in Hong Kong I believe and someone made a comment about your skin color yes I don't know if I should say the chains but I was in a cosmetic store and the guy was I guess trying to make a joke and he basically said that my skin was brown and it was a brown or dark because the air quality in Chinese mainland is dirty or if you know it's so poor so my skin was brown and dirty what did you say back to that I didn't even really know what's the face to be honest I mean I think he realized at the time that that was like not the move I think he realized it so we kind of looked at each other and I just kind of like left after that I was just like well I'm not gonna spend any money here today and it was but it was very frustrating but it was also very eye-opening because you know sometimes it feels as this Hong Kong kind of positions themselves when I've spoken to people from Hong Kong as being so much more enlightened than Chinese mainlanders but it was like no it's still some of the same type of colorism issues that you would deal with here or anywhere else hmm I want to share another example we got from a member of our community this is Alex Downes and he's in Barbados but spend some time working in China and this is what he told us about his experience music black person it was a real culture shock having what I'd say is your your personal space your privacy invaded are most opportunities in public you know whether it is people taking pictures of you without asking or people asking to take pictures of you people need to hold their child people staring at you children pointing that psychologically is really difficult to adapt to that when you've come from a society where even if you are a minority you know is upset it is known that they were CEA's present you know what goes through your mind when you hear experiences like Alex's well to be honest with you I am having lived in the Diaspora for a long time as well I am not sure that this is necessarily an issue which is control certain lis races race issues are not confined to the China and also I have a lot of friends who are from all around the world I came here first works for the UN and and also I have a child and so I kind of I'm around a lot of a lot of people who are who are from all over the world and they also have issues where they worry and are unhappy about 20 people taking pictures of them and so on so I'm not saying that there is no racism issue but I also think that there are whether it's whether it's unfamiliarity there are people in China who have never seen a black person before they also have never seen a blonde woman or blonde man before red-haired etc so there's a lot of there are some people who are just having tourism experiences for the first time and if you around those sorts of areas then this is what you'll experience and I think there are more challenging issues in regard to rating whether it's China or the UK that you're in or even the u.s. of course there's daily issues but what's also important is also the the questions around government policy the questions around how do people do business how do people and and Africans definitely have a more challenging time around the world as well with this so I think what people are experiencing is definitely something that they feel personally whether it's confined to them that's another question hmm attention and the bird so I could see you nodding there as Hannah was was speaking attention what were you thinking yeah I was thinking I'd actually agree with Hannah that is it's a problem not confined to the black community in China it applied to many other foreign isms simply because the country's inexperienced with cultural diversity and rental diversity and so on so there is ignorant there is lack of experience with intercultural interaction and there is cultural differences so to speak but on the other hand I also think recognizing these issues should not prevent us from seeing there is also racism and racial thinking which has a long history in our 20th century and it's not only in people's mind is also in media representations it's also in realities and in the real social interactions and so on see you mentioned media representations I pulled up a few headlines here to illustrate that point so this is reports Africa headline a Chinese exhibit comparing Africans to animal shows the problematic racial attitudes in China and you can see one of the pictures from that exhibit here this was later taken down after people complained the exhibit was removed this is from several years ago but it's one that comes to mind when people are discussing this topic a dishwashing a washing a clothe the laundry detergent ad in which someone of African descent was placed in the washing machine and comes out fair-skinned and and here's another this is a CCTV spring festival gala including as this headline calls it a truly shameless Africa skit featuring a blackface no attention I know you actually wrote about that incident what did that say to you when the service out everyone's talking about it and I thought at the time the focus is really about blackface itself and whether it in itself indicates racism in the Chinese context a lot of defenders were saying that you know imposing a cultural symbol that has its roots in Western colonialism on to China is your sin shape and I thought okay let's contextualize it let's see story size it said instead of the symbol itself I thought what we should be and also talking about be talking about is the history of racial thinking in modern China and lived experiences of racial discrimination in contemporary society so I think that's that's a good exactly why having the kind of conversation we're having right now is really important mm-hmm I have this tweet here from a member of our community Hagman who says I get the discomfort but you are in their land I'm assuming you went there willingly why would and should they be expected to adapt or change their behaviors and customs to suit your comfort levels that's a little bit of a pushback there Roberto he this person mentions people going to China willingly and some of those people are going to one particular community in a specific one one city this is Guangzhou what do you make up this person's comment and why are people coming yeah you know I mean there's a lot of people from different parts of the world coming to enjoy in particular the city this big city in southern China attracts people because of the trading practices because of the commerce right now we need to understand that when we're talking about the interactions that a lot of black people and a lot of African people have in the Chinese city of Guangzhou they have interactions with a very diverse Chinese population right so a little bit like what Hanna was saying earlier there's a lot of people coming from the provinces a lot of people that have never seen foreigners there are the ones interacting with with these African sir and with these black people in Punjab now I think that there's something that is very important to highlight I agree with Hanna and with with tension in the sense that you know all these experiences of people touching or people sort of essentializing the foreignness of different people are very important and we need to consider those but I think that there are way more difficult experiences that many foreigners and particular black people and Africans in Guangzhou experience right I'm talking about certain institutional constraints certain problems that they have with kind of police persecution in the streets a lot of precarity because you get a lot of youngsters that come to Congo and they overstay their visas so I mean I totally agree with Hanna in the sense that you cannot compare the the Chinese context and the experience of race in the Chinese context with what happens in Europe and what happens in North America but it's still a lot of people in the Chinese context feel that is a bit of a difficult experience way Bijan they you know touching the skin touching the hair there are there are problems that are bigger than that and people experience on a daily basis in particularly in cities like Guangzhou here's the tweet we got from Mubarak who says just today I arrived in the city of Guangzhou as a Nigerian it was hell before I could secure a modest hotel room about 10 different hotels refuse me accommodation citing that the security scanner can't scan my country's passport and my visa it's an intentional strategy to frustrate us I would say that I mean that happens to a lot of foreigners that that is not something that only happens to Africans in China or Africans you know I think that there's a lot of media narratives nowadays about Africans in China that sort of focus on certain things that happen to Africans and people say oh there's like an anti African campaign in China and the Chinese government government makes it very difficult for African countries to get or renew business but this happens also to a lot of people from many other countries right I'm not saying it's not a difficult experience from the African side but sometimes in media you see all these all these narratives talking about the problems that Africans faced in China and they don't pay attention to very similar problematic that many other foreigners especially from like Latin America and East Europe also face and the Middle East also faces in China right so sometimes is not only Africans or black people going through these seizures and yes interesting I really agree with that good and I'm so also because I mean part of the part of the challenge and I was recently interviewed as well about about some of these issues in in Jonjo I don't live in Guangzhou so I can't speak for people in Guangzhou but what I do know is that in terms of the setup in terms of the institutional support for African people here in China there's not enough so you know the risk Britain yes business people who are going to plunge Oh Britain has got a Chamber of Commerce a very big change of Commerce who has to have a consul you know several branches across China America the same Australia the same there's nothing like that there's an African Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and they're fairly small at the moment so we need a lot more support and and of course there's a there is an opportunity for China the Chinese government to support this kind of this kind of resources these sorts of ventures and so on support businesspeople in particular are coming into China it's very important part of the relationship but that is really partly because there is an absolute deficit here and again that because we Africans also other continents with the most majority poor people in there in the whole world so we also have to be aware that these are challenges that we also have to take responsibility for and really try and wrestle well so I want to throw a potential twist into this conversation this is from ole Bert and this is picking up on a point that you were making Roberto about remembering that this is not just happening to Africans this is happening to a lot of people Ober it makes the he has a perspective that Westerners are in a different category altogether whether they're black or other ethnicities Albert says I went there as a researcher from a European University when my host university realized black they treated me like a subhuman if you want to go to China as a black person make sure you have a US or British passport he goes on to say it's a perception that anything or anyone from the US and Europe is best and that all from Africa and black is bad the advantage for African Americans is that they had the US passport to cure their blackness nyesha hoping you can wait in here on this one do you think that having that US passport you a slight edge up absolutely and that happens all over that happened to me when I was living in South Korea there happened to me when I was living in Holland you know I got treated differently than a person from Syria Nam did and any type of cool factor that I have or any type of privilege I have here specifically is tie-dye wrestling to the fact that I have an American passport it's not tied to my um my blackness at all no that is 100% correct mm-hmm we got this coming very quickly on the comment on the tweet by overt I know in many ways I agree with him but I also want to say that you know in specifically in the case of China I mean I also have a passport from a third world country or a poor country or whatever but in the case of China it is very interesting to see that when you are a non-white researcher then you find a lot of problems time to the research I myself myself did research for have done research for the last six or seven years in China and a lot of people don't don't think that you're a researcher don't see you as a professor don't see us like you know some like an authority to be your worth of talking to just because you are not any white old professor white beard white hair you know what I mean so I think that that's a global problem this is not only pertaining to China but you know it's tweet by a bird I think it talks to links to this conversation about race and research in China mm-hmm I wanted to bring this come back I want to bring this in and I'll throw it over to attention because we got this on YouTube live this person says I don't know what to think I appreciate that societies around the world should be more inclusive of all groups of people but can you really blame a society as relatively homogenous as China's now Han Chinese account for an overwhelming majority of the ethnic population of China so this does seem to make sense Chandra in a new society yes but it doesn't mean this society should be sticking to sticking to the old kind of hierarchical world wheel as in people but we learn from the loss of the instance we've been hearing about deserve this nineteenth-century racial theories divide the world into biologically distinctive groups and they are terrifically organized with white people on the top some are more superior than others and I think this is very much deeply rooted still in the mind of modern China so to add on to the the racist stories you've learned with the linear about I think this logic also can go against the Chinese themselves as ethnicity for example Chinese Americans for example might find it harder to get a job at English teacher in China than white one native speakers simply because parents might prefer white just prefer white people to teach their children over a Chinese locate native speakers so I don't think that kind of hierarchical worldview shoots us then in a home would relatively homogeneous society and on the other hand China is describing is double projecting itself as a kind of rising power in the world and these kind of strives to be a different kind of power different than the colonial powers in powers and so on and the claims to be more open to the world so I think this is definitely going to need to be changed is important when we talk about racism just a very brief comment when we talk about racism I think that in the context of Africa and China and in general globally we need to talk about racism with an S with a blue roll right because you know when we talk about racism in the context of China we're talking about very different historical and economic factors affecting all this racial imagination about other news right so and I don't want to sound too academic I think that we need to talk about start talking about racism's and not only about racism because when every time we throw that word of racism we're kind of resorting back to the euro-atlantic North American context and we need to contextualize things in the indie Asian and in the Chinese context yeah I have a task for you go ahead Hana okay even in even in in China that other list extends to the smaller ethnic minorities so this is something which is really important for China to address the aspects about other Ness Sena phobia racism whatever you want to call it it does exist and what is important is for I mean part of that is fueled a lot by nationalism so we go back to that that skit at some Spring Gala there were a lot of Chinese people who really actually it personally was what so offensive but there were people who were very very negative about the response some Chinese people who were very extremely defensive about it and this was what really got me actually angry it wasn't us get itself it was a lack of humility in a sense about look actually there are some people who are offended here and we will take we will take their view into account so there is a lot there's a lot of complexity here in China it's not just about touching it's not just about whether whether your skin is black or white and many foreigners have ever had challenges but hopefully this is something that with more interaction more diversity in China which again there's a lot of China you know should be admitting more and more Africans more and more foreigners overall you know no global superpower no diverse country no country can can can work well without that kind of diversity and moving into an innovation basis idea absolutely need us right I think we're light-years from China becoming a migration like a migrant destination country right these are policies are being are being improved for many Europe and for the American you know there's the recently Sania 72 hours or whatever visa-free etc the same in Beijing if you have a British or American accessible or European passports unfortunately no Africans on the list so yes unfortunately the conversation is heating up and that's all the time we have for now I want to thank you for being part of this conversation and for those online keep your comments coming in via Twitter YouTube and aljazeera.com /this stream thanks for joining us today bye for now
