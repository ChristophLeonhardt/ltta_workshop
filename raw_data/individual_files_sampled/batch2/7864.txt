a woman did a DNA test through ancestry.com and the DNA tests revealed that the person who she thought was her father was not her father in fact it was someone completely different who had also done in ancestry.com DNA test and was in the system now the tests showed that her DNA matched a sample from a doctor more than 500 miles away and though she had never heard of him ancestry.com predicted a parent-child relationship between the two so this is a feature of ancestry.com if someone who has the same you know genetic makeup is you is is part of you know this testing thing then they'll come up if they have opted into that right so this doctor comes up and she looks at her birth certificate and realizes wait wait this this obstetrician is the person who helped deliver me and so then she found out that her parents had trouble conceiving and so her mother got artificially inseminated by both who she thought was her biological father's sperm and then a anonymous donor sperm but it turns out that the doctor had used his own sperm and so now they're suing him jarama okay so she the misc ancestry.com thing says this is doctor 500 miles away Gerald Mortimer she tells her parents her parents are like oh they're trying to decide whether to tell her or not then she finds her birth certificate and it says Gerald Mortimer and she's like but it's not the parent it's the doctor who delivered her and explained she's like wait a minute I know that name well what's crazy as the parents didn't know the doctor had used his own sperm yes what the parents asked for and this is weird is use the father's sperm which had issues and an anonymous donor as an I explained and I guess so like I guess we'll never know right but they wanted the donor to be over six feet tall and have like brown hair and blue eyes and all these specifications that Mr Mortimer did not or dr. Mortimer did not he's like I'm gonna use my own sperm money right and apparently when they moved away they found it weird that the doctor broke down and started crying from their town it's because he knew that it was his daughter this is so crazy this is insane so ancestry.com I don't know I mean take your DNA test at your own risk because you might find things that you don't want to know oh but you will apparently get up the truth so upside downside what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
