1
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:10,543
>> Sean: AS WE CONTINUE WITH

2
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,210
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:11,944
FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RUDY

4
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:13,146
GIULIANI, I WANT TO CLARIFY

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,080
SOMETHING BECAUSE I WAS ASKING

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,717
YOU ABOUT PERKINS COOLEY AND YOU

7
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,686
SAID THE MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,154
MONEY -- I'M GIVING YOU A FACT

9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,423
NOW THAT YOU DON'T KNOW, IT'S

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,124
NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY, NO CAMPAIGN

11
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:26,125
VIOLATION AND I SAID BECAUSE

12
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,694
THEY FUNNELED THROUGH A LAW

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,094
FIRM.

14
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:28,828
I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

15
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,963
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

16
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,366
>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE

17
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,567
$130,000 PAYMENT, IT'S A VERY

18
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,303
REGULAR THING FOR LAWYERS TO DO.

19
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,971
THE QUESTION THERE WAS, THE ONLY

20
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,207
POSSIBLE VIOLATION WOULD BE

21
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,142
WASN'T A CAMPAIGN FINANCE

22
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:43,543
VIOLATION.

23
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,744
WHICH USUALLY RESULTS IN A FINE

24
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,847
MANATT THIS BIG STORMTROOPERS

25
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,817
COMING IN AND BREAKING DOWN THE

26
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:56,089
APARTMENT.

27
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,590
THAT WAS MONEY THAT WAS PAID BY

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,294
HIS LAWYER, THE PRESIDENT

29
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,028
REIMBURSED THAT OVER THE PERIOD

30
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,497
OF SEVERAL MONTHS.

31
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,698
>> Sean: HE SAID I JUST THINK

32
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,667
THE REMEMBER THAT HE DID IT ON

33
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,669
HIS OWN WITHOUT ASKING.

34
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,504
>> I DON'T KNOW, I HAVEN'T

35
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,606
INVESTIGATED THAT, NO REASON TO

36
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,542
DISPUTE THAT, I LIKE MICHAEL A

37
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,912
LOT, YOU LIKE MICHAEL A LOT.

38
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:20,580
I FEEL VERY BAD HE'S BEEN

39
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,617
VICTIMIZED BY THIS.

40
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,186
THE FACT IS, TRUST ME THEY'RE

41
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,288
GOING TO COME UP WITH NO

42
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,624
VIOLATIONS.

43
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,093
PAYMENTS ARE PERFECTLY LEGAL.

44
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,262
>> Sean: LET ME GO BACK TO THE

45
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,032
MAIN CRUX, THE CRUX IS WE HAVE A

46
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:43,136
TWO-TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM.

47
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,271
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT WHEN HE

48
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:45,738
SAYS WITCH HUNT?

49
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,473
>> YEAH.

50
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:48,074
SURE.

51
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,309
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT ANY OTHER

52
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,478
WAY.

53
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:53,379
THERE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN

54
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,147
UNDER INVESTIGATION.

55
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,282
THERE WAS NO RUSSIA COLLUSION.

56
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,184
WE ARE NOW A YEAR AND A HALF,

57
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,786
TWO YEARS INTO THIS, THERE'S NO

58
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,488
RUSSIA COLLUSION, CASE OVERPAID

59
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,490
>> Sean: AND FALLING ALL OVER

60
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,224
THEMSELVES TO INVESTIGATE HIM,

61
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:06,426
THEY HAVE COMMITTED NUMEROUS

62
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:11,497
VIOLATIONS INCLUDING LIES,

63
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:15,301
CRIMINAL DECEPTION, OUTRAGEOUS

64
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,171
SEARCH WARRANTS LIKE THE ONE ON

65
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,239
COHEN.

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,942
HOW ABOUT WE GO BACK TO PAUL

67
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,877
MANAFORT, BREAKING INTO HIS

68
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:25,645
HOUSE?

69
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,147
HE WASN'T A VIOLENT CRIMINAL.

70
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:30,283
>> Sean: WHY DOES THIS END?

71
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,786
>> WHAT THEY DID TO MENA      PU

72
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,655
>> WHAT THEY DID TO MENA      PL

73
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,324
MANAFORT, I USED TO DO TO THE

74
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:38,724
MAFIA.

75
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,893
>> Sean: HOW DO YOU SEE THIS

76
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:41,227
ENDING?

77
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,096
YOU TALK TO MUELLER.

78
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,365
>> THEY'RE GOING TO WRITE A

79
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:49,869
REPORT, THEY CAN'T INDICT HIM, I

80
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,304
DON'T BELIEVE THEY CAN SUBPOENA

81
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:51,571
HIM.

82
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,639
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WRITE

83
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,075
A REPORT, IF WE DO GET

84
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,109
INTERVIEWED, THEY WILL WRITE THE

85
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:00,246
REPORT BASED ON THE INTERVIEW.

86
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,949
THEY WON'T WRITE IT BY THE

87
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,617
HILLARY GUY, HE'S NOT A SPECIAL

88
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,852
PERSON, HE'S BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH

89
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,120
THE SAFETY OF THE WORLD.

90
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,789
>> Sean: IS THIS ELECTION IN

91
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,525
2018 GOING TO BE A REFERENDUM ON

92
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,894
DONALD TRUMP?

93
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,096
>> WERE GOING TO GO TO THE

94
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,898
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SAY YOU WANT

95
00:03:18,898 --> 00:00:00,000
TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT?
