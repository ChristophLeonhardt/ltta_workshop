2
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,555
YEARS SINCE ALLIED FORCES

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,823
STORMED THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY

4
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:16,123
IN A DARING MISSION THAT

5
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:18,660
ULTIMATELY LED TO THE TOTAL

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,328
DEFEAT OF NAZI GERMANY.

7
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:21,930
THE THINGS THEY WITNESSED WERE

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,898
UNSPEAKABLE.

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,533
TODAY, AND A MOVING CEREMONY IN

00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,473
LAID A WREATH.

13
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:32,908
BUT AHEAD OF THAT EVENT, THE

00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,743
GOOD FOLKS OF THE NATIONAL

MARTHA TRAVELED TO WASHINGTON

00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:44,519
YESTERDAY TO HEAR THEIR STORIES.

20
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,422
>> MY FULL NAME IS HARLAN

21
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:47,889
LINCOLN HORNER.

22
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,925
I WAS 18 WHEN I WENT INTO

23
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,328
SERVICE IN APRIL OF 1943.

24
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:56,731
I WAS 19 WHEN I WENT OVERSEAS.

25
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:00,068
>> I WAS 18.

26
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:02,337
MY FULL NAME IS McDONALD H

27
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:02,637
BEACH.

28
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:07,142
>> YOU WERE SENT OVER ON A SHIP

29
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:08,310
FOR A LONG TIME?

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,745
>> NINE DAYS ON THE OLD FRANCE.

31
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,948
I WAS SEASICK FOR NINE STRAIGHT

32
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:13,648
DAYS, NEVER THOUGHT I'D REACH

33
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:14,015
THE WAR.

34
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,952
BUT IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET OFF

35
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:17,319
THE SHIP.

36
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,154
>> WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR

37
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:22,157
COMMANDERS TELLING YOU ABOUT THE

38
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:22,757
MISSION?

39
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:25,961
ABOUT THE INVASION, ABOUT D-DAY?

40
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,762
>> ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL,

41
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:30,365
THE GREATEST FORCE EVER HURLED

42
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,366
AGAINST A HOSTILE SHORE.

43
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:32,667
>> I DON'T THINK THEY KNEW TOO

44
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,202
MUCH WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

45
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:36,605
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE

46
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:37,806
BETWEEN 10:00 A.M. AND NOON, AND

47
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,476
WE DIDN'T GET THERE UNTIL 7:00

48
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,111
IN THE EVENING AND BECAUSE OF

49
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:43,645
THE

50
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,279
THE HEAVY SEAS.

51
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,714
SO WE STAYED ON THE BEACH ALL

52
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:47,315
NIGHT AND WATCH THE FIRING OF

53
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,350
THE BRITISH BATTLESHIPS AND ALL

54
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,921
THE OTHER SHIPS FIRING ONTO THE

55
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,023
GERMAN FORTIFICATIONS ON SHORE.

56
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:55,857
>> Martha: WHAT STANDS OUT TO

57
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:58,827
YOU WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO BEING

58
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,127
THERE?

59
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:00,028
>> SEEING THE WOUNDED AND SOME

60
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:02,797
OF THE DEBT ON THE BEACH AS WELL

61
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:04,299
AS A TOUGH SITUATION.

62
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,469
>> Martha: TELL ME ABOUT YOUR

63
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,739
ARRIVAL IN FRANCE AFTER D-DAY.

64
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,907
>> WE HAD TO WALK.

65
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:13,541
I KEPT THINKING THAT DUFFEL BAG

66
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,709
WAS SO HEAVY.

67
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,511
I KEPT THINKING, I CAN'T DO

68
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,312
THIS.

69
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:18,246
BUT I THOUGHT, IF ALL THESE

70
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:22,284
OTHER GUYS CAN DO IT, I CAN DO

71
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:27,656
IT.

72
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:29,324
I STOPPED AND A PIECE OF

73
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,325
SHRAPNEL WENT ACROSS.

74
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,127
IT WAS NOTHING BUT A FLESH

75
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,762
WOUND, BUT I WAS LEFT IN THE

76
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:37,365
FIELDS OVERNIGHT AND I GOT

77
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:37,732
PNEUMONIA.

78
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:41,970
>> Martha: YOU ARE LEFT IN THE

79
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,437
FIELD OVERNIGHT?

80
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,773
>> A WHOLE BUNCH OF US WERE.

81
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,942
>> THERE WERE INTERESTING AND

82
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,576
FUNNY TIMES AND REALLY

83
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,544
HORRENDOUS TIMES.

84
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,747
WE WERE A CHILD, THAT WAS THE

85
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:53,181
SCARIEST PART.

86
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,749
>> ONE OF THE MOST POIGNANT

87
00:02:54,749 --> 00:03:07,329
THINGS TO ME WAS, IN LONDON,

88
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,332
BEFORE WE WENT ACROSS TO

89
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:11,533
NORMANDY.

90
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,335
SUCH A NICE GIRL THAT I DANCE

91
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:13,635
WITH.

92
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:15,737
AND SHE SAID, MY NAME IS

93
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,071
DOROTHY.

94
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:22,310
COME ANY TIME, I'M MOST NIGHTS.

95
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,478
AND ONE OF THE STRIKES COME UP

96
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:26,581
THAT LITTLE DANCE BAR WAS

97
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,716
COMPLETELY WIPED OUT.

98
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:29,718
>> Martha: DID YOU LOSE

99
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:30,952
FRIENDS IN THE WAR?

100
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:33,555
>> WE LOST OUR BATTERY

101
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:39,561
COMMANDER, AND WE LOST A GUNNERY

102
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:40,528
SERGEANT, AND OUR FIRST

103
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:41,129
SERGEANT.

104
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,365
AND MY VERY CLOSE FRIEND, WHO

105
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:46,134
WAS A RADIO OPERATOR WITH ME.

106
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:48,136
BOB BOWDEN FROM NEW MEXICO WAS

107
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,005
CAPTURED, AND HE WAS INJURED AND

108
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:51,940
IN A GERMAN HOSPITAL FOR A

109
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,240
WHILE.

110
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,942
AND THEN WHEN THEY LEFT THE

111
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,843
TOWN, THEY RELEASED HIM AND LET

112
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:55,977
HIM GO.

113
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:59,147
HE CAME BACK WITHOUT HIS HELMET,

114
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,148
I WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM.

115
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,650
>> Martha: DO YOU REMEMBER

116
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,752
THAT MOMENT WHEN HE SHOWED UP?

117
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:05,954
>> YES I DO.

118
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,089
WHEN HE WALKED INTO THE BATTERY

119
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:09,557
AREA, I RAN OVER TO GREET HIM,

120
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:12,027
IT WAS GREAT.

121
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:13,361
>> Martha: AND YOU WERE IN

122
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,796
PRETTY MUCH EVERY MAJOR

123
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,065
OPERATION ALL THE WAY FROM

124
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:22,737
NORMANDY TO V-E DAY.

125
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:26,941
>> ALL FIVE CAMPAIGNS.

126
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:27,742
NORMANDY, FRANCE, BATTLE OF THE

127
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,811
BULGE, RHINELAND AND IN CENTRAL

128
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,145
EUROPE.

129
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,179
>> Martha: TELL ME ABOUT WHEN

130
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,415
YOU GOT WORD THE WAR WAS OVER.

131
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:36,151
>> THIS IS A SOLEMN BUT GLORIOUS

132
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,152
HOUR.

133
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,019
I WISH THAT

134
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,421
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT HAD LIVED

135
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:40,655
TO SEE THIS DAY.

136
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:45,126
>> WE HEARD IT ON THE TINKERS

137
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,729
RADIO, AND IT WAS A WILD

138
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:48,129
CELEBRATION.

139
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,299
WE COULDN'T FIND ANY PILLS OR

140
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,334
BEER.

141
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,738
WHEAT SAID IT, WHERE'S THE BEER?

142
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,740
WELL SOMEONE HAD FOUND A

143
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,641
WAREHOUSE OF WONDERFUL GERMAN

144
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:00,141
BRANDY.

145
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:01,543
THEY FELT OF A TWO AND A HALF

146
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:03,578
TON TRUCK WITH IT AND OUR

147
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:04,946
BATTERY COMMANDER SAID, THAT'S

148
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:07,482
FINE, BUT YOU HAVE TO SHARE WITH

149
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:08,950
THE REST OF THE BATTALION.

150
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,619
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT YOU,

151
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:14,122
DON, WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES OF

152
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:14,422
THAT?

153
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:16,524
>> I REMEMBER THAT DAY.

154
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,527
THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS

155
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,562
ALWAYS UNDER FOOT, RUNNING HERE

156
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:24,099
AND IF THEY THERE.

157
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:30,371
HE CAME RACING IN AND SPOKE IN

158
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,006
GERMAN.

159
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:34,776
AND MY LIEUTENANT SAID IT, DON'T

160
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,744
TELL ANYBODY, BUT I'VE GOT

161
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:37,345
SOMETHING UP AND SAVING.

162
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:41,316
AND HE GOT OUT A BOTTLE OF

163
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,083
CHAMPAGNE THAT WAS ROOM

164
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,884
TEMPERATURE.

165
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,420
AND WE ALL DRINK IT.

166
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,255
>> Martha: THERE IS A PRAYER,

167
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,124
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR

168
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:49,991
WITH IT.

169
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:52,127
BUT FDR READ UP ON THE RADIO.

170
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:55,663
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT?

171
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:56,998
>> NO.

172
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:58,867
>> Martha: IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL

173
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:03,104
PRAYER, A RADIO ADDRESS TO ALL

174
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:03,738
1944.

175
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:08,743
AND IT PART OF IT HE SAYS, THEY

176
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,311
WILL NEED THEIR BLESSINGS.

177
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,947
THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND HARD.

178
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,549
FOR THE ENEMY IS STRONG.

179
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:16,518
THEY WILL BE SORE TRYING COME BY

180
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:20,255
NIGHT AND BY DAY, WITHOUT REST,

181
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,925
UNTIL THE VICTORY IS WON.

182
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,761
THE DARKNESS WILL BE RENT BY

183
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,129
NOISE AND FLAME.

184
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,898
MEN'S SOULS WILL BE SHAKEN WITH

185
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:37,138
THE VIOLENCES OF WAR.

186
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:40,742
>> YOU KNOW, ALL OF US THAT WERE

187
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:44,078
GOING TO BE IN ON D-DAY,

188
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:44,712
EISENHOWER WROTE A LETTER.

189
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,548
