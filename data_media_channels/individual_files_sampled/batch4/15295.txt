behind the scenes Michael Gove has been pushing for the UK to remain in the EEA which would see us maintain free movement and open borders Michael Gove has long been seen as a potential brexit Prime Minister even before Theresa May and earlier this month a large Tory Party donor warned that Michael Gove could be installed as the new Conservative Party leader because May can't carry breaks it through remember Michael Gove ran in the Tory leadership contest after David Cameron resigned he even ran in the leadership contest after David Cameron stepped down he was said to have stabbed Boris Johnson in the back by standing in the race in the first place in positioning himself as a breaks a tier candidate it looked like Boris really did have his eyes on the top job at the time but it looks like the Tory party's great brags a tier Hope has actually been discussing a secret plan with other members of parliament about keeping the UK in the EEA the European Economic Area the Express reported brexit campaigner Mr Gove was talking with Tory MPs and peers at a dinner when the Conservative MP raised the scenario where the UK would remain in the EEA like Norway so they could avoid the chaos of a disorderly no deal exit the cabinet minister was speaking at a private dinner of the green chip group which was set up in support of David Cameron during his time as Prime Minister with about 20 Tory MPs and peers on June 25th according to the Financial Times one MP at the dinner said he was steering the conversation towards the EEA idea there's no doubt about that but others said that he wasn't advocating the EEA idea at all and the Express also reported that an ally of Gove explained he's totally behind the Prime Minister's checkers strategy he's not considering any other option he likes discussing things so here's the reality Michael Gove once considered the potential brexit prime minister a man who campaigned to leave the European Union is one of two things he's either a supporter of the EEA model which would see us remain in the European Economic Area like Norway and maintain our open borders and free movement of God in capital etc with the EU or he's on board with Teresa mais checkers deal which is treasonous which goes against the will of the people which denies the Democratic will of the people the millions of us who voted the 52% he supports one or the other of these deals and this man this man was meant to be the great brexit hope of the conservative party new reports suggest that Michael Gove was talking up the possibility of a Norway style brexit before he got on board with Teresa mais EU appeasement checkers deal now the fact that Michael Gove even considered the possibility of trying to keep the UK in the EEA which would maintain our open borders maintain freedom of movement proves to me that we cannot trust the Tories on brexit and if we can't trust Gove Arch Briggs's here and who can we trust maybe Jacob Riis marketing he's a rare find in the Tory Party and it seems to me that the Tories are just as wearing as the Labour Party to deny the will of the people and of course to appease the European Union they'll do whatever is convenient as long as it means they can say technically technically they did their job and that's treason in my book but it's treason via laziness because here's the thing they can't do the job well they don't have the negotiating skills and they don't have the will to do it in the first place so they're gonna do the bare minimum the bare minimum and just hope they're gonna get away with it if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
