00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:11,799
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,235
REFUSED SERVICE AT A RESTAURANT.

5
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:15,870
HE MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,805
IT WAS A MEAN THING TO DO BUT IN

7
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:20,141
A NEW ERA WHERE MEAN GIRLS RULE,

8
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:22,643
SOME MEAN GIRLS THINK IT'S A

9
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:23,411
PLUS.

10
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:24,645
JENNIFER RUBIN WROTE A PIECE ON

11
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:27,415
THE LOST ART OF SHUNNING.

12
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,416
SHE FEELS FOR THE RESTAURANT

13
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,384
OWNER.

14
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:31,619
JENNIFER, SHUNNING NOT A LOST

00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,420
ART.

16
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,188
IT WAS ONCE USED TO OSTRACIZE

17
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,924
PEOPLE FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS.

18
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:37,825
IT'S EXTREMISM.

19
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:38,493
JENNIFER HATES TRUMP AND

20
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:40,428
EVERYONE LINKED TO NAME SOME OF

21
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:42,129
THE EXTREMISM IS WARRANTED.

22
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,564
MEANWHILE, MAXINE WATERS WANTS

23
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:55,309

>> Greg: YOU'RE NOT WELCOME AT

27
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:11,459
WORK WE SAW IT STARTED.

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,328
>> IF YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP, THEN

29
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:18,366
YOU, THE VOTER, ARE STANDING AT

00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:23,271
THE BORDER LIKE NAZIS GOING YOU

31
00:01:23,272 --> 00:01:23,838
HERE, YOU HEAR.

32
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,806
WE HAVE TO FLIP IT.

33
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:26,741
GIVEN THE EVILNESS OF

34
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,576
DONALD TRUMP BUT IF YOU VOTE

35
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,578
COMEDIC NO LONGER SUPPORT

00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,613
YOURSELF.

00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,815
A >> Greg: WHAT A DOPE.

38
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,250
WHY IS THE GUY YELLING NAZI

39
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,452
OFTEN BEST IN IMITATING ONE.

40
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:45,760
SHUNNING, HARASSMENT,

41
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:46,360
NAME-CALLING, VIOLENCE.

42
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,128
OR COMING RIGHT TO YOUR HOME TO

43
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:53,801
TERRIFY YOUR FAMILY.

44
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:58,205
>> FREE THE KIDS.

45
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,441
FREE THE KIDS.

46
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:02,543
SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.

47
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:03,911
>> Greg: WHAT IF SHUNNING WENT

48
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:05,212
BOTH WAYS.

49
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:08,215
WHAT IF COPS IGNORED 911 CALLS

50
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:09,283
BECAUSE OF POLITICS?

51
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,986
WHO DO YOU THINK THE POLICE

52
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:13,454
SUPPORTS MORE?

53
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:14,155
NANCY PELOSI OR DONALD TRUMP.

54
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:15,890
IT'S AN EASY GUESS.

55
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:16,691
BUT THE POLICE WOULD NEVER, EVER

56
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:17,592
DO THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT

57
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:20,628
IT MEANS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC.

58
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,230
WHAT IS AS BAD AS SHUNNING?

59
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,367
HOW ABOUT DESIRING A PERSON'S

60
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:29,170
PRESENCE AT AS HIRED HELP.

61
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,106
THE TRIBALISM AMONG RESTAURANTS,

62
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:35,910
THE LEFTISTS SNARKED WHO IS

63
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,313
GOING TO COOK AT REPUBLICAN ONLY

64
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:44,652
RESTAURANTS?

65
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:45,820
THEY EXPECT THEM TO VOTE THEIR

66
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,655
WAY BUT ONLY AFTER THEIR SHIFT

67
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:50,424
IS OVER AND THE QUESTION.

68
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:52,193
SHOULD MAXINE WALK IT BACK?

69
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:53,894
>> Dana: I DON'T THINK SHE'S

70
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,429
GOING TO BUT NANCY PELOSI TRIED

71
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,830
TO.

72
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,664
SHE TWEETED THAT IT WAS

73
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:59,634
UNACCEPTABLE AND SHE WANTS TO

74
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:00,668
MAKE AMERICA BEAUTIFUL AGAIN.

75
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:01,369
SHE DID TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY

76
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,439
PEOPLE ARE REACTING TO SOMETHING

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,241
BUT SHE WAS NOT FOR THE

78
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:07,642
INSTABILITY.

79
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:13,481
NEWS NOW, MAXINE WATERS YEARS

80
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:16,817
AGO IN HER DISTRICT, IT WOULDN'T

81
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,419
OF BEEN FRONT PAGE NEWS EVER BUT

82
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,155
NOW YOU DO RUN THE RISK OF

83
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:22,456
SOMEONE LIKE MAXINE WATERS

84
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:26,160
PAINTS EVERYONE WITH A BROAD

85
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:26,827
BRUSH.

86
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,863
WHAT SHE IS DISCUSSING SOMETHING

87
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:29,497
UNHEALTHY AND OBNOXIOUS.

88
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:30,631
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS

89
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:33,434
PEOPLE WHO THINK THIS IS GOOD,

90
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:39,840
WE ARE CREATURES WHO WANT TO

91
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:40,408
SURVIVE.

92
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,443
IF YOU FEEL CORNERED, YOU FIGHT

93
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:44,278
BACK.

94
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,747
IT COULD ESCALATE QUICKLY.

95
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,516
>> Greg: JUAN, AM TORN ABOUT

96
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:49,650
THE RESTAURANT THING.

97
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,523
OR RESTAURANT, IS IT MORE OF AN

98
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:59,560
ACCEPTED PROCESS BECAUSE THAT

99
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,364
STANCE IS NO LONGER TETHERED TO

100
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:03,731
HARDSHIP.

101
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:05,332
IT'S NOT LIKE THE '60s.

102
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,668
IF I SAY YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE,

103
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,136
IT MIGHT THE ONLY RESTAURANT IN

104
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,540
WAS NOT AS HARD TO FIND IN THE

105
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,240
PLACE TO GO?

106
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,341
DO YOU FOLLOW ME?

107
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,677
>> Juan: I DIDN'T BUT I'M

108
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,448
'60s IT WAS OVER RACE.

109
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,617
SUPER K CREATED A REAL HARDSHIP.

110
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:30,658
>> Juan: THERE WERE BLACK

111
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,626
RESTAURANTS TO GO TO IN THE

112
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:33,227
'60s.

113
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,128
IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY IN THE AS

114
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:34,762
SENSE THAT THERE'S THAT

115
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:35,696
TREMENDOUS AND SAID HISTORY IN

116
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:40,534
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SAY

117
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:43,838
THERE'S HISTORY OF TRUMP

118
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,272
SUPPORTERS BEING EXPORTED FROM

119
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:45,673
RESTAURANTS.

120
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,842
A >> Greg: I SAYING IS THAT

121
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,978
OKAY NOW THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER

122
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,379
OPTIONS IN GENERAL FOR PEOPLE

123
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,614
THAT IF YOU SAY I DON'T WANT YOU

124
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,716
IN MY RESTAURANT, YOU CAN GO

125
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:56,183
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

126
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:56,917
>> Juan: I DON'T THINK IT'S

127
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,522
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

128
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:01,956
NANCY PELOSI,

129
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:02,623
"THE WASHINGTON POST," DAVID

130
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:07,695
AXELROD SAID IT.

131
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:11,966
AXELROD SAID TRUMP HAS REALLY

132
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,501
BEEN ROUGH IN TERMS OF HIS USE

133
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:15,136
OF LANGUAGE AND     AND THE THIG

134
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:15,169
OF LANGUAGE AND     AND THE THIS

135
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,202
OF LANGUAGE AND     AND THE THIH

136
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:15,236
OF LANGUAGE AND     AND THE THI'

137
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:15,469
OF LANGUAGE AND     AND THE THIS

138
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,371
ENCOURAGED HIS SUPPORTERS TO DO.

139
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,673
BUT IT'S NOT A REASON, IT

140
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:22,676
DOESN'T JUSTIFY THE LACK OF

141
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:24,245
CIVILITY OR RUDENESS TO PEOPLE

142
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,480
WHO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT

143
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,581
OF AGREEMENT WITH.

144
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:31,352
IT WOULD LEAD US DOWN THE ROAD

145
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:32,620
HERE WHERE WE REDUCE OURSELVES

146
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,721
TO TRIBALISM AND WE ARE SHOUTING

147
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:36,157
AND SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER.

148
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:38,359
BREAKING APART OUR COMMON BONDS

149
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,226
AS AMERICANS.

150
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:41,228
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD.

151
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,830
>> Greg: SPEAKING OF TRIBALISM

152
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,265
AND TRUMP, JESSE, I DO THINK

153
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,873
THING HE DID, IT WAS DIRECTED TO

154
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,508
OTHER REPUBLICANS FOR THE

155
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:54,942
LONGEST TIME.

156
00:05:54,943 --> 00:06:00,648
IT WASN'T AN IDEOLOGICAL ORIGIN.

157
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,650
>> Jesse: I DON'T SEE THAT

158
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:03,417
SIMILARITY WITH THAT RESTAURANT

159
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:03,717
THING.

160
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:06,954
LIKE YOU SAID, IT YOUR

161
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:08,489
LIBERTARIAN.

162
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,828
I THINK THIS BEHAVIOR PLAYS INTO

163
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,262
DONALD TRUMP'S HANDS.

164
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:16,630
LAST COUPLE YEARS UNDER THE

165
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,899
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, YOU HAD

166
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,633
ANTIFA, RACIAL RIOTS, OPEN

167
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:25,506
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ELECTED TO

168
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:27,942
CLEAN UP THAT KIND OF MESS IN

169
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:28,876
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

170
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,444
FUNDAMENTALLY ARE DECENT PEOPLE.

171
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,546
THEY WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE

172
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:33,214
RESPECTED, AND THEY ARE NOT

173
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:48,796
GOING TO TOLERATE RAGE-

174
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,765
IF YOU SAY DONALD TRUMP AND HIS

175
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,934
CABINET ARE NAZIS, IT'S GOING TO

176
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:57,238
INCITE PEOPLE TO TREAT PEOPLE

177
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:03,277
PUT THEIR LIVES IN DANGER.

178
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:04,945
THE NAZI COMPARISON IS LAZY,

179
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,247
HISTORICALLY INACCURATE, IT

180
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:08,482
MEANS THEY'VE LOST THE ARGUMENT.

181
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,450
I BELIEVE IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE

182
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,852
TRUMP IS WINNING, NOT LOSING,

183
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:13,454
AND THIS IS DRIVING THE LEFT

184
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:13,854
CRAZY.

185
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:15,122
HE IS SECURING THE BORDERS, AND

186
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:17,658
THAT'S A THREAT TO THE LEFT.

187
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:18,659
THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT.

188
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,927
THEY ARE NOT ACTING LIKE THEY'RE

189
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,599
ACTING LIKE THEY ARE DESPERATE.

190
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,836
THIS IS ALL THEY HAVE LEFT.

191
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,878
THEY ARE LITERALLY MELTING DOWN

192
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,612
BEFORE OUR EYES, THERE'S NO ONE

193
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:40,814
IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT CAN

194
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:41,248
CONTROL THEM.

195
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:43,817
AND IT'S JUST HELPING

196
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:44,385
DONALD TRUMP SUCCEED.

197
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:48,756
HIS NUMBERS AS RECORD HIGH RIGHT

198
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:50,858
NOW.

199
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:51,525
>> Greg: CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER

200
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:54,828
WITCHES COME AS A CONSERVATIVE,

201
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:57,665
WE THINK THEY ARE WRONG BUT THEL

202
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:57,698
WE THINK THEY ARE WRONG BUT THEF

203
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:57,932
WE THINK THEY ARE WRONG BUT THET

204
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:02,236
THINKS WE ARE EVIL.

205
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:03,837
IF THEY THINK YOU'RE EVIL, THEY

206
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:04,838
CAN DO ANYTHING TO YOU.

207
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,707
IF THEY THINK YOU ARE NOT TO

208
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,942
COME, AND MORALLY THEY ARE RIGHT

209
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:14,481
LEVEL OF VITRIOL IN THE RHETORIC

210
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:18,619
FAMILY, TO BE ABLE TO SOMEONE

211
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,688
YOU CAN'T EAT HERE AT THIS

212
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:21,255
RESTAURANT.

213
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:23,624
YET THEY FIGHT FOR THE CASES

214
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,892
LIKE THE GAY RIGHTS TO BE ABLE

215
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,894
TO HAVE A WRITING CAKE MADE OR

216
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:28,829
SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE, IT'S A

217
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:37,337
SOMETHING LIKE THE DEVIL, THEN

218
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:38,472
THEY ARE SAY THEY ARE JUSTIFIED

219
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:40,640
IN DOING IT MORE LAND ETHICALLY.

220
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,313
CALLING FOR THIS ARE CALLING TO

221
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:51,385
PUT A CHILD IN A CAGE WITH

222
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:55,255
PEDOLPHILES, AT ATTACKS AGAINST

223
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:55,956
FAMILIES CAN YOU IMAGINE SARAH

224
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,225
SANDERS OR HER FAMILY GOING INTO

225
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:02,196
HER RESTAURANT, SAYING YOU CAN'T

226
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:02,863
EAT THERE.

227
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,264
IT'S GOING BACK IN TIME.

228
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:07,534
IT'S NOT MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS

229
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:09,636
OF CIVILITY IN DISCOURSE AND

230
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:10,771
DISAGREEING WITH SOMEONE RATHER

231
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:12,873
THAN HATING THEIR GUTS AND

232
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:17,444
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.

233
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:19,146
BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE WHAT YOU

234
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:19,546
STAND FOR.

235
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,849
>> Juan: I DON'T THINK THIS

236
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,316
STARTED BEFORE.

237
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:25,252
I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS OUT OF

238
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:27,454
TRUMP'S RHETORIC IN THE WAY

239
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:31,692
UNDER OBAMA.

240
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:33,427
I DON'T REMEMBER THIS HAPPENING

241
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:34,728
UNDER, EVEN WHEN THERE IS ANGER

242
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,663
AT GEORGE W. BUSH ABOUT NOT

243
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:41,435
FINDING WEAPONS OF MASS

244
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:41,835
DESTRUCTION.

245
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:42,636
I DON'T REMEMBER THIS KIND OF

246
00:09:42,637 --> 00:09:45,239
ACTING OUT ON EITHER SIDE.

247
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,241
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE NOW I THINK

248
00:09:47,242 --> 00:09:49,243
HIS PEOPLE FOCUSING ON THIS AND

249
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:50,244
NOT ON THE POLICY.

250
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:01,989
PROBLEM BUT CRYING CHUCK SCHUMER

251
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,859
DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

252
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,863
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO

253
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:10,497
CRITICIZE DONALD TRUMP FOR

254
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:11,465
PEOPLE TREATING THE PEOPLE THAT

255
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,500
WORK FOR HIM LIKE ANIMALS.

256
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,468
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

257
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:16,270
>> Juan: TRAIN THE PEOPLE THAT

258
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:16,703
WORK FOR HIM.

259
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:20,307
>> Jesse: WHEN PEOPLE PROTEST

260
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,242
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS YOU CAN'T

261
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:23,444
BLAME THAT ON DONALD TRUMP MODE

262
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:24,678
YOU JUST DID.

263
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,646
THAT'S UNFAIR.

264
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:28,282
IT'S ON THEM, NOT DONALD TRUMP.

265
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:30,350
>> Jesse: IF YOU GO TO A

266
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:30,984
DONALD TRUMP RALLY AND

267
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:31,852
DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING I WILL

268
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:32,920
PAY LEGAL FEES IF ANY OF YOU

269
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:35,189
WANT TO BEAT UP PEOPLE.

270
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,256
WHAT IS GOING ON?

271
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:38,759
>> Jesse: WE KNOW THAT THE

272
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,794
PEOPLE SWINGING OR PAID

273
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:41,195
PROTESTERS.

274
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:44,264
>> Juan: HOW ABOUT

275
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:46,433
DONALD TRUMP SAYING IF

276
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:47,134
HILLARY CLINTON IS ELECTED AND

277
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:47,868
APPOINTED A SUPREME COURT JUDGE

278
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:50,471
AND DOES ANYTHING TO YOUR GUN

279
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:51,538
RIGHTS, YOU SECOND AMENDMENT

280
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:52,806
COME ON.

281
00:10:52,807 --> 00:11:01,448
>> Jesse: THERE HAS BEEN --

282
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:03,584
>> Juan: WHAT DO YOU CALL THE

283
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,252
LADY GETTING RUN OVER IN

284
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:05,719
CHARLOTTESVILLE?

285
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,988
>> Jesse: I WOULDN'T BLAME

286
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:08,555
DONALD TRUMP FOR THAT.

287
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:10,724
I BLAME THAT INDIVIDUAL.

288
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,559
>> Juan: THEN HOW DO YOU BLAME

289
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,261
THE RESTAURANT OWNER?

290
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,662
NOBODY IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

291
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,164
TOLD HER RESTAURANT OWNER WHAT

292
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:17,998
TO DO.

293
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:18,599
>> Jesse: PEOPLE IN THE

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,438
ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO REFUSE

298
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,640
PEOPLE SERVICE.

299

>> Greg: I THINK THE WHAT
