Massachusetts Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren senator widow if you were president what would you do what's the solution this mess on the border with these big separate is helping out hard this is even hard it is entirely up to the President of the United States all he has to do right now is pick up the phone and say to jeff sessions say to the Department of Homeland Security stop and do not separate children from their parents do not rip babies out of the arms of their mothers and we're done and so the parents who are going to on trial because they're playing for it's not Asylum with the kids stay with them how would that work sure you can make it work but look you don't have to prosecute them criminally let's keep in mind what we're talking about here are taking women who have been raped who've been beaten who fear for their lives who flee to the United States asking for asylum and for the act of asking the United States government because of Donald Trump is ripping their children away from them that is not who okay because we know the situation if they come to a point of entry fine but if they come across the border illegally across the border which you know what we see pictures of it when they come across they're going to be detained for processing they're going to be held for a while there's a 20-day requirement that you have to release throughout the twenty days Trump calls that catch or at least because if they wait up to twenty days they get to stay in the United States so there is no border no no come on if you want to pick people up because they've entered illegally then get them in front of a magistrate get them in front of a judge we have a process for doing this and if someone has a credible claim to make for amnesty if someone has a credible claim to make that they want to cylon then let them make the claim but you don't take their children away simply because they've what do you think of what you must have watched Secretary of Homeland Security Nielsen yesterday do you think she should resign did you like that performance no I did not I think she not only should resign I think that before she has a chance to resign she should be fired really look come you don't blame Trump you blame her no what I'm saying is he should get rid of her this is not helpful but all of this goes face it you're you're a political person this was a policy person Trump's plan it's like a banjo you what he's doing he's revving up his base with this the Red Hots on anti-immigration attitudes he's playing it you know he's gonna play in the election so it's not just her attempt I also don't see it this way Chris you don't think your line is no I'm gonna say this differently I think there are some things in America that go beyond politics and Trump me think he's playing a political game here yeah but ultimately this one hits deep were America lives not just Democrat America Republican America independent America people who just don't care about politics people who say this is not what America does we do not put small children in cages we do not separate the Phaedo or Trump well this move people against him well people begin to see him as a bad guy now who liked it before what what I care about is that people push Trump to stop this that's where we need to be right now and it's keeping in mind this is not about legislation this is not about anything else this is appealing to the President of the United States this is insisting as loudly as we can to the President of the United States this is not who we are in America he is taking America to a dark and ugly place is there anything I wish the senator can do is the Senate frozen now the action here you know I think that this is about Trump not a question of whether or not we could pass legislation over a long process this is happening to children tonight well you and I are sitting here not before we get to do it positively I wrote this question what should we do if you were president cuz that's legitimate question when people come here from Central America with children and they come across the border illegally how would you handle this as opposed to other presidents handling us detain them we would take them in front of a court but we would not separate families we just don't and that's to AB under the law even though they have the 20-day rule and all these rules I think we can do that if that's what we want to do and put the resources into why is Trump doing this I don't know I can't get him to like Donald Trump's head and I don't want to get psyched out you think he's irrational look it doesn't matter maybe whatever it is he's doing it's not for me to speculate the point is it's wrong okay Jeff Sessions is Cornell policy that takes us away that commerce I'm with you on this I just want to know how you say you said that Kirsten Nielsen should go yeah she should be fired what about Jeff Sessions her boss and not her boss but the one who really set this policy out he said he wants zero tolerance he's the boss in this policy he set it down she's had the following Trump is the boss let's be clear it's Donald Trump this is all she knows but Jeff Sessions he owns it we're done how about Jeff Sessions should he go you know he's got a lot going on right yeah I know because he's protecting the sessions who is a nasty anti-immigrant guy okay you know that you know that at the same time he is sort of keeping things together on the prosecution of the Russian probe let me let me make that just let me make the coherent point around this though and that is the sorts of things that the Homeland Security Secretary got out and defended yesterday come on this is this is not what we should be doing for Homeland Security but all of it is back to Donald Trump and the tip is to stay on Donald Trump if Donald Trump does not want children taken away from their mothers at the borders he fixes that and he fixes it now and if he fails to do that the blame does not fall on anyone else the blame falls squarely on daughters the Republican Party to share that plane for backing him everyone in America who does not speak out shares that blame this is not politics thank you sir well said senator Elizabeth Warren the best use thank you for coming on hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want
