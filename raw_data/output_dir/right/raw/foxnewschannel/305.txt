00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:13,613

00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,217
IT COMES AS A SHOCK TO 

9
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,151
WASHINGTON INSIDERS, NO ONE 

10
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,253
KNEW LEADING UP TO THIS 

11
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:20,720

MEETING INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE.

16
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,362
BOTH SHARED THEIR THOUGHTS ON 

17
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,196
THIS BREAKING NEWS.

18
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,099
LET'S LISTEN.

19
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,767
>> President Trump: NORTH 

20
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:35,501
CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, 

21
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,537
TEXAS, PUERTO RICO, SO MANY 

22
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,471
PLACES.

23
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,106
WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING, A 

24
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,074
BIG ONE.

25
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:41,974
MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY 

26
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:42,942
ANTICIPATED SEVEN DAYS AGO.

27
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,212
I HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME 

28
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,714
THERE WAS A VERY SMALL DROP OF 

29
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,216
WEATHER THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS 

30
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,085
FORMING AND NOW IT'S PRETTY 

31
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,953
CLOSE TO A CATEGORY 3 IF IT IS 

32
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,355
NOT ALREADY A CATEGORY 3.

33
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,157
WE ARE VERY WELL PREPARED.

34
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,359
FEMA IS READY.

35
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,626
WE'RE ALL READY.

36
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:01,761
SPOKE WITH GOVERNOR SCOTT, 

37
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,296
SPOKE TO EVERYBODY THAT YOU 

38
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,897
HAVE TO SPEAK TO.

39
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:06,332
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET LUCKY.

40
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,801
MAYBE THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

41
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,670
BUT WE'RE PREPARED.

42
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,942
I WANTED TO DO THIS BECAUSE 

43
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:16,709
NIKKI HALEY, AMBASSADOR TO THE 

44
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,810
UNITED NATIONS, HAS BEEN VERY 

45
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,978
SPECIAL TO ME.

46
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,280
SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

47
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,117
SHE IS A FANTASTIC PERSON, VERY 

48
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,418
IMPORTANTLY, BUT SHE ALSO IS 

49
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,022
SOMEBODY THAT GETS IT.

50
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,925
SHE HAS BEEN AT THE UNITED 

51
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,159
NATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING AND 

52
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,228
WORKED WITH US ON THE CAMPAIGN.

53
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:39,065
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME, VERY 

54
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,335
INTENSE AND SHE TOLD ME 

55
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,503
PROBABLY SIX MONTHS AGO SHE 

56
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,438
SAID MAYBE AT THE END OF A 

57
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,306
TWO-YEAR PERIOD, BUT TEND OF 

58
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,207
THE YEAR I WANT TO TAKE A 

59
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:48,842
LITTLE TIME OFF.

60
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,543
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

61
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,445
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL 

62
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:56,349
GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA, FOR 

63
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:56,816
EIGHT YEARS.

64
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,619
THEN SHE DID THIS AND THIS IS 

65
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,586
POSSIBLY EVEN MORE INTENSE WITH 

66
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,990
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD.

67
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,625
VERY DANGEROUS AND A LOT OF 

68
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:05,958
THINGS.

69
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,994
SHE HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB 

70
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,628
AND WE'VE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB 

71
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:09,996
TOGETHER.

72
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,264
WE'VE SOLVED A LOT OF PROBLEMS 

73
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,399
AND IN THE PROCESS OF SOLVING A 

74
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,367
LOT OF PROBLEMS.

75
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,601
AT THE BEGINNING NORTH KOREA 

76
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:18,404
WAS A MASSIVE PROBLEM.

77
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,474
NOW WE'RE MOVING ALONG REALLY 

78
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:21,807
NICELY.

79
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,343
I CAN SPEAK FOR SECRETARY OF 

80
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,345
STATE MIKE POMPEO, HE THINKS 

81
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,881
THE WORLD OF NICKI.

82
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,750
AND SO WE'RE ALL HAPPY FOR YOU 

83
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,786
IN ONE WAY BUT WE HATE TO LOSE 

84
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,053
YOU.

85
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,087
HOPEFULLY YOU WILL BE COMING 

86
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:37,390
BACK AT SOME POINT.

87
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,558
MAYBE A DIFFERENT CAPACITY.

88
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,959
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK.

89
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,828
BUT I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW 

90
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,766
AT THE END OF THE YEAR NIKKI 

91
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:51,437
WILL BE LEAVING AND WE'LL BE IN 

92
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:51,904
CONSTANT TOUCH.

93
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:52,871
YOU KNOW ALL THE PLAYERS.

94
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,540
THAT WAS THE THING I THINK SHE 

95
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,142
DID BEST AT THE UNITED NATIONS.

96
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,244
SHE GOT TO KNOW THE PLAYERS.

97
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,981
SHE GOT TO KNOW CHINA, RUSSIA, 

98
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:02,281
INDIA.

99
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:05,051
SHE KNOWS EVERYBODY ON A VERY 

100
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,919
FIRST NAME BASIS AND THEY LIKE 

101
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,821
HER EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A COUPLE 

102
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,421
WHICH IS NORMAL.

103
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:10,923
THEY REALLY LIKE HER.

104
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:15,361
I THINK MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY 

105
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,062
THEY RESPECT HER.

106
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,930
SO NIKKI, I WANT TO TELL YOU 

107
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,631
WE'LL MISS YOU.

108
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,066
WE'LL SPEAK OVER TIME AND WE'LL 

109
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,801
MISS YOU AND YOU HAVE DONE A 

110
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,702
FANTASTIC JOB AND I WANT TO 

111
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,103
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

112
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,638
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

113
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,974
I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL I 

114
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,476
WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR 

115
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,878
JUST ALLOWING US TO COME OUT 

116
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,447
AND TALK TO YOU THIS WAY.

117
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,082
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR OF A 

118
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:37,449
LIFETIME.

119
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,453
I SAID I'M SUCH A LUCKY GIRL TO 

120
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,321
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEAD THE 

121
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:44,190
STATE THAT RAISED ME AND TO 

122
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,292
SERVE A COUNTRY I LOVE SO VERY 

123
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,627
MUCH HAS REALLY BEEN A BLESSING 

124
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,296
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 

125
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:50,596
THAT.

126
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:54,567
BUT I'M MOST EXCITED.

127
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,502
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN 

128
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,238
TWO YEARS WITH THE UNITED 

129
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,407
STATES ON NORTHERN POLICY.

130
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,809
COUNTRIES MAY NOT LIKE WHAT WE 

131
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,677
DO BUT THEY RESPECT WHAT WE DO.

132
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,546
IF WE SAY WE'LL DO SOMETHING WE 

133
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,413
FOLLOW IT THROUGH.

134
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,448
THE PRESIDENT PROVED THAT 

135
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,017
WHETHER IT WAS WITH THE 

136
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:17,023
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA OR 

137
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,423
NATO OR THE TRADE DEALS.

138
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:19,826
THEY GET THE PRESIDENT MEANS 

139
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,226
BUSINESS AND THEY FOLLOW 

140
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:21,761
THROUGH WITH THAT.

141
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,162
BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK AT TWO 

142
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:26,765
YEARS AT THE U.N.

143
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:30,036
WE'VE GOT $1.3 BILLION IN THE 

144
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,503
U.N.'S BUDGET.

145
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,839
MADE IT STRONGER AND MORE 

146
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,206
EFFICIENT.

147
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:42,482
SOUTH SUDAN WE GOT AN ARMS 

148
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:42,815
EMBARGO.

149
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,583
THREE NORTH KOREAN PACKAGES 

150
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:51,390
DONE IN A WAY TO WORK TOWARD 

151
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,058
DENUCLEARIZING NORTH KOREA.

152
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,126
BRINGING IRAN AND SAYING YOU 

153
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,228
CAN'T OVERLOOK THE BAD THINGS 

154
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,529
THEY'RE DOING AND SEE THEM FOR 

155
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,199
THE THREAT THEY ARE.

156
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,466
THE ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS AND THE 

157
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,802
COURAGE THE PRESIDENT SHOWED IN 

158
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,736
MOVING THE EMBASSY AND SHOWING 

159
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,838
THE REST OF THE WORLD WE WILL 

160
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,240
PUT OUR EMBASSY WHERE WE WANT 

161
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,375
TO PUT OUR EMBASSY.

162
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,411
ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE MADE A 

163
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,613
HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE U.S. 

164
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,650
STANDING BUT I CAN TELL YOU 

165
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,285
THAT THE U.S. IS STRONG AGAIN.

166
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:25,191
THE U.S. IS  STRONG IN A WAY IT 

167
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,392
SHOULD MAKE ALL AMERICANS PROUD.

168
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,027
NOT JUST THE PRESIDENT I WANT 

169
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:28,594
TO THANK.

170
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,395
THE FAMILY IN GENERAL.

171
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:31,797
THE FIRST LADY HAS BEEN NOTHING 

172
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,699
BUT VERY KIND TO ME.

173
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,002
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS 

174
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,371
ABOUT JARED AND IVANKA.

175
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,372
JARED IS SUCH A HIDDEN GENIUS 

176
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:41,707
THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.

177
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:44,243
TO REDO THE NAFTA DEAL THE WAY 

178
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:44,810
HE DID.

179
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,546
WHAT I'VE DONE WORKING WITH HIM 

180
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,881
ON THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PLAN 

181
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,783
IS SO UNBELIEVABLY WELL DONE.

182
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,850
IVANKA HAS BEEN A GREAT FRIEND 

183
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,986
AND THEY DO A LOT OF THINGS 

184
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,488
BEHIND THE SCENES THAT I WISH 

185
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,390
MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT BECAUSE 

186
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,924
WE'RE A BETTER COUNTRY BECAUSE 

187
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:01,427
THEY'RE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION.

188
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,828
I ALSO JUST HAVE TO SAY 

189
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:05,164
CERTAINLY THANK YOU TO MY 

190
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,533
FAMILY, MICHAEL IS A SAINT AND 

191
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,804
MY TWO LITTLE ONES, I ADORE 

192
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,005
THEM AND TO TEAM US/UN.

193
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,507
THEY PUT A LOT OF TIME AND 

194
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,275
ENERGY INTO IT BUT THEY HAVE A 

195
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,144
LOT OF HEART AND REALLY WANTED 

196
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,012
TO MAKE AMERICA PROUD AND SO 

197
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:20,947
WITH THAT I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL 

198
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,114
THE END OF THE YEAR.

199
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,749
MY GOAL IS THAT WE MAKE SURE 

200
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,052
THAT EVERYTHING IS IN GOOD 

201
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,187
PLACE AND FOR THE NEXT 

202
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,789
AMBASSADOR TO COME IN BUT IT IS 

203
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,424
A GREAT DAY IN THE UNITED 

204
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,791
STATES AND I'M PROUD TO HAVE 

205
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,393
BEEN PART OF THE TEAM.

206
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,162
NOW I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SET 

207
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,697
ON WHERE I'M GOING TO GO.

208
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,133
I THINK THAT THE MAIN THING WAS 

209
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,535
I WAS GOVERNOR FOR SIX YEARS 

210
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:46,339
AND WE DEALT WITH A HURRICANE, 

211
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,443
A THOUSAND YEAR FOOD, A CHURCH 

212
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,143
SHOOTING, SCHOOL SHOOTING.

213
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:54,480
THEN TO COME IN FOR TWO YEARS 

214
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,414
AT THE U.N.

215
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,482
I'M A BELIEVER IN TERM LIMITS.

216
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,684
I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE SELFLESS 

217
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,419
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN YOU STEP 

218
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,754
ASIDE AND ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO 

219
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,154
DO THE JOB.

220
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,623
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

221
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,491
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR OF A 

222
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,658
LIFETIME AND I WILL SAY THIS 

223
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:09,028
FOR ALL OF YOU THAT ARE GOING 

224
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,264
TO ASK ABOUT 2020, NO, I'M NOT 

225
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,199
RUNNING FOR 2020.

226
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,834
I CAN PROMISE YOU IS THAT I'LL 

227
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,736
BE CAMPAIGNING FOR THIS ONE.

228
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,669
I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING 

229
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,839
THE PRESIDENT IN THE NEXT 

230
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,206
ELECTION.

231
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,943
>> President Trump: THANK YOU.

232
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:28,180
>> WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE 

233
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,648
IT BEHIND?

234
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,282
IS IT REALLY A PERSONAL 

235
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,317
DECISION BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN 

236
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,319
AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY?

237
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,254
>> MY FAMILY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE.

238
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,656
THERE IS NO PERSONAL REASONS.

239
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,557
I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 

240
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:39,257
FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO 

241
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,560
UNDERSTAND WHEN IT IS TIME TO 

242
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,294
STEP ASIDE.

243
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:44,396
AND I HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING 

244
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,032
I'VE GOT THESE LAST EIGHT YEARS 

245
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,134
AND I DO THINK THAT SOMETIMES 

246
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,769
IT'S GOOD TO ROTATE IN OTHER 

247
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,904
PEOPLE WHO CAN PUT THAT SAME 

248
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,773
ENERGY AND POWER INTO IT.

249
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,174
SO THERE REALLY IS A LOT OF 

250
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:55,975
PEOPLE WILL WANT TO SAY THERE 

251
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,543
ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY I'M 

252
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:57,876
LEAVING.

253
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:00,346
THE TRUTH IS I WANT TO MAKE 

254
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,947
SURE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND 

255
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:02,681
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE STRONGEST 

256
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:03,482
PERSON TO FIGHT.

257
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,951
IT WAS A BLESSING TO GO INTO 

258
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:07,686
THE U.N. WITH BODY ARMOR EVERY 

259
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,088
DAY AND DEFEND AMERICA.

260
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,157
I'LL ALWAYS DO THAT.

261
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,259
I WILL NEVER TRULY STEP ASIDE 

262
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,193
FROM FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY 

263
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,828
BUT I WILL TELL YOU I THINK 

264
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,664
IT'S TIME.

265
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,065
>> WHY MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT 

266
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,434
NOW AS OPPOSED TO AFTER THE 

267
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,201
MID-TERMS?

268
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,602
>> President Trump: NICKI WILL 

269
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,705
BE STAYING UNTIL THE END OF THE 

270
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,206
YEAR, JUST ABOUT TWO YEARS.

271
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,843
AND I JUST THINK -- I WAS JUST 

272
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,746
-- AS NIKKI WAS SPEAKING WHEN 

273
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,614
WE CAME INTO OFFICE IT WAS 

274
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,015
ALMOST INEVITABLE IN THE MINDS 

275
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,683
OF MANY WE WERE GOING TO WAR 

276
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,520
WITH NORTH KOREA.

277
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,155
IF YOU ASKED PRESIDENT OBAMA 

278
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,323
THAT WAS HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM 

279
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,191
WHEN WE SAT AND MET RIGHT HERE.

280
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:49,729
BUT THAT LOOKED LIKE A REAL 

281
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,062
PROBLEM.

282
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,798
IRAN LOOKED LIKE A REAL PROBLEM.

283
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,467
IT WAS A QUESTION OF WHEN WOULD 

284
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,535
THEY TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE EAST 

285
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,204
PRIOR TO MY COMING HERE.

286
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,072
NOW IRAN IS FIGHTING FOR THEIR 

287
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:00,372
LIVES.

288
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,707
THEY HAVE RIOTS IN ALL THEIR 

289
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,043
CITIES, IT IS BLOWING UP.

290
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,544
INFLATION AND ECONOMY IS IN 

291
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,178
TATTERS.

292
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,146
AT SOME POINT THEY'LL PROBABLY 

293
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,515
COME AND WANT TO MAKE A REAL 

294
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,050
DEAL.

295
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,451
NOT THE RIDICULOUS DEAL THAT 

296
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,618
THEY MADE THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE 

297
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,521
TO ME AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

298
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,789
WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IRAN 

299
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,723
WHEN WE FIRST CAME.

300
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,559
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE DAY 

301
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,027
BEFORE WE CAME, AND ALSO IF YOU 

302
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,929
LOOK AT NORTH KOREA.

303
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:28,067
THERE WAS A DEAL THAT THERE WAS 

304
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,135
SOMETHING THAT WAS DEVASTATING 

305
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,570
-- POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING 

306
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:31,903
PROBLEM.

307
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,038
NOW THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY 

308
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:33,506
GOOD.

309
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,641
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 

310
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,945
JUST LEFT, HAD A GREAT MEETING 

311
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,347
ALSO WITH CHINA, ALSO SPOKE TO 

312
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,783
MANY OF THE ASIAN LEADERS OR 

313
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,417
WENT THERE AND HAD SOME GOOD 

314
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,520
MEETINGS BUT HAD A REALLY VERY 

315
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,056
GOOD MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA.

316
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:51,823
AND CHAIRMAN KIM.

317
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:53,859
WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS 

318
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:59,765
ON SO MANY OTHER FRONTS ALSO.

319
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,400
AS NIKKI SAID, THE WORLD IS 

320
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,835
RESPECTING THE UNITED STATES 

321
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,135
AGAIN.

322
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,503
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN, THAT I 

323
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,372
CAN TELL YOU, VERY MUCH 

324
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:06,839
RESPECTED AGAIN.

325
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,241
AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE ON OUR 

326
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:09,542
SIDE.

327
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,243
EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE VOTES 

328
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,679
IN THE UNITED NATIONS.

329
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,815
VOTES THAT WE WOULD GET NO 

330
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,183
VOTES WE'RE GETTING STRONG 

331
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:17,650
VOTES NOW.

332
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,353
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK NIKKI.

333
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:23,122
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN 

334
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,323
APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT.

335
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,092
WHEN YOU WRITE IT ON A PIECE OF 

336
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:28,027
PAPER THAT AMBASSADOR HALEY 

337
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,662
WILL BE LEAVING AND YOU SAY 

338
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,096
NICE THINGS PEOPLE SAY WHAT IS 

339
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:31,463
GOING ON?

340
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,666
THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.

341
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,533
WHEN YOU REALLY THINK SOMEBODY 

342
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,235
HAS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB.

343
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,636
I FELT THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE 

344
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,271
WAY OF DOING IT AND WE BOTH 

345
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:43,075
LIKED IT SO I JUST WANT TO 

346
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,543
THANK THE AMBASSADOR.

347
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,280
I JUST WANT TO THANK NIKKI.

348
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,448
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT 

349
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,317
WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO DO IT.

350
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,687
IT IS A GREAT POSITION AND 

351
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,621
NIKKI REALIZES THAT.

352
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,088
I THINK SHE HAS HELPED MAKE IT 

353
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:58,324
A MUCH BETTER POSITION IF YOU 

354
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,859
WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

355
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,961
I THINK IT HAS BECOME MAYBE A 

356
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,228
MORE GLAMOROUS POSITION THAN IT 

357
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:05,264
WAS TWO YEARS AGO.

358
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,999
MAYBE, I WONDER WHY, BUT IT IS.

359
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,101
SHE HAS MADE IT A VERY 

360
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,003
GLAMOROUS POSITION AND MADE IT 

361
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,607
A MORE IMPORTANT POSITION.

362
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,809
SO WE HAVE -- I CAN ALMOST SAY 

363
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,444
MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DO IT 

364
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,247
AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD PEOPLE.

365
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,349
I'LL BE TALKING ALSO TO NIKKI 

366
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,451
ABOUT THAT AND TO THE GENERAL 

367
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,086
ABOUT THAT AND MY STAFF.

368
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,890
WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE 

369
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,426
VERY, VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN 

370
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:34,793
DOING IT.

371
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,763
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

372
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,632
>> President Trump: NOT ONLY AM 

373
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,266
I NOT FRUSTRATED.

374
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,801
I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT'S 

375
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:43,168
HAPPENING.

376
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,169
YOU TALKING ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

377
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:49,041
WHO ARE YOU WITH?

378
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,143
IT'S AMAZING THE WAY THE MEDIA 

379
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,012
SAYS FOR 80 YEARS THEY COULDN'T 

380
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,247
DO A THING AND WHAT ARE WE IN, 

381
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,183
THREE MONTHS OF NEGOTIATION?

382
00:11:58,183 --> 00:11:59,652
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

383
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,521
AS I'VE SAID ABOUT A THOUSAND 

384
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:02,821
TIMES.

385
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,056
NO ROCKETS OR MISSILES FLYING 

386
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,690
OR NO NUCLEAR TESTING.

387
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,993
YOU HAVE NUCLEAR CLOSINGS.

388
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,662
THEY'RE CLOSING DIFFERENT AREAS 

389
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,297
OF NORTH KOREA, WE'RE GETTING 

390
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,165
THE REMAINS BACK.

391
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,800
IT'S ALREADY STARTED OF OUR 

392
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,501
GREAT HEROES.

393
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,537
WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK AND I 

394
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,639
DIDN'T PAY $1.8 BILLION LIKE 

395
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,841
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

396
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,776
I PAID NOTHING.

397
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,845
BUT I HAVE AGREED TO MEET AND I 

398
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,714
HAVE AGREED TO SPEND TIME.

399
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,984
BUT HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE 

400
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,152
WE LEFT SINGAPORE?

401
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,754
THREE MONTHS OR SO AND PEOPLE 

402
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,222
SAY THAT'S THE MEDIA SAYING HOW 

403
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:39,525
CAN WE BE NEGATIVE?

404
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,728
HOW CAN WE BE NEGATIVE?

405
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,662
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?

406
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,531
I THINK -- NO NUCLEAR TESTS, NO 

407
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,567
ROCKETS, AND WE HAVE A VERY 

408
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,904
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN 

409
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,739
KIM WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT.

410
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,108
I LIKE HIM, HE LIKES ME, THE 

411
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:56,708
RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD.

412
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,210
MIKE POMPEO HAD A VERY GOOD 

413
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,543
MEETING.

414
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,779
I SPOKE TO HIM AT LENGTH 

415
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,382
YESTERDAY AND HE WILL BE COMING 

416
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:03,682
BACK.

417
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,484
HE WILL BE BACK TONIGHT.

418
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,353
AND SO JUST THE OPPOSITE.

419
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,155
I THINK WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE 

420
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:10,622
PROGRESS.

421
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:12,458
BEYOND INCREDIBLE.

422
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,326
I DON'T THINK -- SOME OF THE 

423
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,494
PRESS REALLY COVERS IT 

424
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,061
ACCURATELY AND RIGHT.

425
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,732
BUT SOME OF THE PRESS REALLY 

426
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,065
DOESN'T.

427
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,067
>> DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS 

428
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,302
OPPORTUNRTUNITY WHEN YOUR NEXT 

429
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,205
MEETING WITH KIM WILL BE?

430
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,874
>> President Trump: IT IS 

431
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,341
HAPPENING NOW.

432
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,944
THEY ARE SETTING UP THE MEETING 

433
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,079
AND WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING THAT 

434
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,381
PROBABLY AT A DIFFERENT 

435
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,415
LOCATION.

436
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,583
SINGAPORE WAS FANTASTIC BUT 

437
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,519
WE'LL PROBABLY DO A DIFFERENT 

438
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,453
LOCATION.

439
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,621
>> MAR-A-LAGO?

440
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,957
>> HE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THAT.

441
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:45,891
WE'LL SEE.

442
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,793
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE OR 

443
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,427
FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.

444
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,661
TIMING WON'T BE TOO FAR AWAY.

445
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,764
WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND 

446
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,198
THIS MEETING -- PEOPLE DON'T 

447
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:54,800
REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 

448
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,734
FIRST MEETING.

449
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,103
WE SAID POINT NUMBER ONE 

450
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:58,603
DENUCLEARIZATION.

451
00:13:58,603 --> 00:13:59,371
FOR SOME REASON THE PRESS 

452
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,906
DOESN'T PICK THAT UP.

453
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,542
THAT WAS POINT NUMBER ONE.

454
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,243
THEY'VE AGREED TO 

455
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,177
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THEY 

456
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,046
CONTINUE TO AGREE AND THEY 

457
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:07,413
CONTINUE.

458
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,047
NOW, WE HAVEN'T REMOVED 

459
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,349
SANCTIONS AS YOU KNOW.

460
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,551
PEOPLE SAID WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

461
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,786
WE HAVEN'T REMOVED SANCTIONS.

462
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,020
WE HAVE BIG SANCTIONS.

463
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,422
I WOULD LOVE TO REMOVE THEM BUT 

464
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,592
WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING FOR 

465
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:20,992
DOING THAT.

466
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:21,660
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

467
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,762
>> President Trump: I DON'T 

468
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,264
WANT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY BY 

469
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:25,597
ASKING.

470
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,132
I THINK EVENTUALLY WE'LL HAVE 

471
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,001
LOTS OF MEETINGS ON U.S. SOIL 

472
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,236
AND ON THEIR SOIL, BY THE WAY.

473
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,404
THAT'S A TWO-WAY STREET.

474
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,373
ON THEIR SOIL ALSO.

475
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,674
I THINK THAT THE COUNTRY OF 

476
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,910
NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO BE A 

477
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,644
VERY SUCCESSFUL COUNTRY.

478
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,647
I THINK IT WILL BE INCREDIBLY 

479
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,381
ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL AND I 

480
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,782
WANT TO MAKE IT THAT WAY.

481
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,620
I THINK IT WILL BE GOOD.

482
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,721
OTHER COUNTRIES, OTHER PEOPLE, 

483
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,756

484
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,624
TELL YOU THEY ARE CALLING AND 

485
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,960
WANTING TO GO THERE AND WANTING 

486
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,429
TO INVEST AT SOME POINT WHEN 

487
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,263
CHAIRMAN KIM MAKES THAT 

488
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:58,730
DECISION.

489
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,132
I THINK HE WILL UNLEASH 

490
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,968
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 

491
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:03,735
SPECTACULAR, REALLY SPECTACULAR.

492
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,070
I THINK HE KNOWS IT AND I THINK 

493
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,506
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE 

494
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,407
HAVING VERY SUCCESSFUL 

495
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:08,841
CONVERSATIONS.

496
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:13,245
I THINK HE WANTS TO GET ON WITH 

497
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:13,512
IT.

00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,199
IF YOU LOOK AT INDUSTRIES, THE 

559
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,867
STEEL INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY 

560
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,703
IS BACK LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER 

561
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,403
SEEN BEFORE.

564
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,510

565
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,211
LITERALLY REVIVED.

566
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:33,251
U.S. STEEL IS OPENING UP EIGHT 

567
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:33,618

568
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:34,553
NUCORE IS OPENING.

569
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,421
THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS HOT.

570
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:37,356
THAT'S GREAT.

571
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,992

572
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,060
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

573
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,228
>> President Trump: VERY WELL.

574
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,163
WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 

575
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,732
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.

576
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,433
THEY TOOK OUT $500 BILLION OUT 

577
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,602
OF OUR COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS 

578
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,002
EACH YEAR.

579
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,704
WE JUST CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

580
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,606
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TALKED 

581
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,708
ABOUT BY PEOPLE IN THIS CHAIR 

582
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,676
FOR MANY YEARS.

583
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,946
LOOK, FOR YEARS AND YEARS THEY 

584
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,182
WERE TAKING OUT 200, 300, 400, 

585
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:07,119
AND 500 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

586
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,121
WE HELPED REBUILD CHINA.

587
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,223
IF WE DON'T DO THAT, CHINA IS 

588
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,424
NOT WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW 

589
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,059
AND THAT'S FINE WITH ME BUT WE 

590
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,162
AREN'T DOING IT ANY LONGER.

591
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:17,863
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

592
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,133
>> President Trump: ABSOLUTELY.

593
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:21,433
100%.

594
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,337
IF THEY DO THAT -- IF THEY 

595
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:25,704
RETALIATE.

596
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,938
THEY'VE ALREADY RETALIATED 

597
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,407
TAKEN OUT $500 BILLION.

598
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,143
I THINK THAT'S THE ULTIMATE 

599
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:31,543
RETALIATION.

600
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,879
NO, CHINA WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL 

601
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,448
AND I SAY THEY'RE NOT READY YET.

602
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,550

NOT READY TO MAKE A DEAL.

606
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,790
WE CAN'T HAVE A ONE-WAY STREET.

607
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,393
IT HAS TO BE A TWO-WAY ST. IT 

608
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,096
HAS BEEN A ONE-WAY STREET FOR 

609
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,497

00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,833
