you've probably heard of Sabo he's taken on Hillary Syrian refugees Hollywood Bernie and pretty much every far-left activist or personality you can think of on the streets of Los Angeles he's an artist with a mission and this time he's taken on Asia Argento the actress who has been accused of sexual harassment after actor Jimmy Bennett claims she sexually assaulted him at the age of 17 the claims were published first by the New York Times alleging that she had sex with a boy at a California hotel in 2013 our Gento said that her and Bennett were only linked and friendship and that's it this has turned into a huge story the past few days and I must add that Argento has since denied the claims of sexual assault and says her late boyfriend Anthony Bourdain was the one who paid off Bennett with eight three hundred and eighty thousand dollar settlement she claimed Bennett knew my boyfriend Anthony Bourdain was a man of great perceived wealth and had his own reputation as a beloved public figure to protect Anthony personally undertook to help Bennett economically upon the condition that we would no longer suffer further intrusion in our life Bourdain took his own life in France just this June but has long been a supporter of our dento through her time making allegations against Harvey Weinstein this is why all this matters because if these allegations turn out to be true then it might well display a level of hypocrisy it might also suggest some deeper institutionalized problems within the industry if the accusations against Weinstein are true and if it turns out that Bennett's accusations are true as well I think there's something really here to think about I mean there are photographs of the pair which suggests they are both naked in bed and I think that's kind of hard to explain away and Sabo's artwork reflects all of these concerns he's plastered images of the actress Argento all over the streets of LA giving the finger with the slogan hashtag she too on the front of them it's not the first time Sabo has taken on Hollywood either not too long ago he put up posters of Meryl Streep throughout LA criticizing her links to Harvey Weinstein and exclaiming she knew and Streep admits she did so this new piece is a continuation on the Meryl Streep she knew posters it comes from the me2 movement to show the hypocrisy that she knew and with a clever pun so this Asia poster is a play off of that with she to I think the secrets from Hollywood will keep coming out this is an industry plagued with problems with deceit with abuse and with wives I'm sure there is plenty more to come out of this and this kind of artwork from the right or at least the non far left will keep them on their toes this is really effective stuff as we have seen the left can meme they don't do activism very well their art has been pretty crappy this is not only effective art but effective activism that doesn't result in destruction and mayhem if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
