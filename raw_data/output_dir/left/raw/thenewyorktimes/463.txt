1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,146
This is one of Rwanda's
reconciliation villages,

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,282
where perpetrators and victims
of the country's genocide

3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,618
live side by side.

4
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:22,455
At least 800,000 people were
killed during 100 days

5
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,559
of violence that began in April
of 1994 when the country's

6
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,230
Hutu ethnic majority targeted
their Tutsi neighbors.

7
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:33,433
But 23 years later, the
country has formalized the

8
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,703
reconciliation process in
villages like this.

9
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,009
Jacqueline Mukamana and
Mathias Sendegeya are two

10
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,178
of these unlikely neighbors.

11
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,221
Children are taught a
state-mandated reconciliation

12
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:32,692
curriculum from a young age.
On this day, their assignment

13
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,829
was to describe their
hopes for the future.

14
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,801
On this morning, the entire
village is taking part in a day

15
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,672
of mandatory community service,
known as Umuganda,

16
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,842
to instill a sense of
cooperation and work to rebuild

17
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,677
the nation.

18
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,312
Here, the residents
are digging a

19
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,216
drainage ditch to prevent homes
in the community from flooding.

20
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,954
While the adults work, the
children gather to play and

21
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,022
performed a traditional dance.

22
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,158
For a new generation
being raised

23
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,560
in an inclusive community,

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:00:00,000
these children identify first
as Rwandan.
