1
00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:01,671
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNING.

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:02,906
>> Tucker: INTERESTING.

3
00:00:02,906 --> 00:00:05,208
MARK STEYN, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

4
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:06,443
>> THANKS, TUCKER.

5
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:07,710
>> Tucker: DEMOCRATS ARE UPSET

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,712
ABOUT SPEECHES LIKE THAT AND

7
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:11,247
ABOUT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY

8
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:11,748
ITSELF OF COURSE.

9
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,249
BUT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, THEY

10
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:14,751
HAVE CONSOLED THEMSELVES BY

11
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:17,353
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE MID-TERMS.

12
00:00:17,353 --> 00:00:20,823
THE 2018 CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION.

13
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:22,058
THEY THOUGHT WE'RE GOING TO WIN

14
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:22,325
BIG.

15
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:23,960
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK POWER.

16
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,927
THEY MAY.

17
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:26,796
RECENT POLLS SHOW THAT DEMOCRATS

18
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,831
ONE MASSIVE LEAD IS SHRINKING.

19
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:29,799
NOW TO ALMOST NOTHING.

20
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,067
A NEW POLL OVER AT CNN SHOWS

21
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:35,271
THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE ONLY A

22
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,006
3-POINT ADVANTAGE ON A GENERIC

23
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:37,706
CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT.

24
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:38,441
IS THIS REAL?

25
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,341
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

26
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:42,278
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

27
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:43,812
TOM BE VIN FOLLOWS THIS

28
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:44,914
CAREFULLY AND JOINS US TONIGHT.

29
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,583
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT, TOM?

30
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,350
IS IT REAL?

31
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,887
>> I THINK IT'S REAL, TUCKER.

32
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,523
YOU GO BACK AND LOOK IN MID

33
00:00:54,523 --> 00:00:54,890
DECEMBER.

34
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,525
THE DEMOCRATIC LEAD IN MID

35
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:57,492
DECEMBER, WOULD YOU VOTE FOR

36
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,360
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT,

37
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,796
DEMOCRATS HAD A 13-POINT LEAD.

38
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:03,231
AS OF TODAY, IT'S DOWN TO 6.

39
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,268
IN OUR REAL CLEAR POLITICS

40
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:06,602
AVERAGE.

41
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:09,204
THE CNN POLL WENT 16 POINTS DOWN

42
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:09,805
TO THREE.

43
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:11,306
ANOTHER POLL SHOWING IT DOWN TO

44
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:12,674
ONE POINT.

45
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,309
SO THIS IS REAL.

46
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:17,245
IT IS JUST AS A POINT OF

47
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,181
REFERENCE, IN 2006, WHEN

48
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:22,584
DEMOCRATS WON 30 STATES, THEY

49
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:28,189
FINISHED WITH A 7.9 PERCENTAGE

50
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:28,489
LEAD.

51
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,724
SO I THINK THEY'RE IN THAT RANGE

52
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,627
WHERE IT'S MAKING THEM VERY

53
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:32,961
NERVOUS.

54
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:33,695
>> Tucker: SO REPUBLICANS IN

55
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:35,430
CONGRESS HAVE BEEN ASSUMING FOR

56
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,766
MONTHS -- I TALKED TO THEM --

57
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,768
THAT THEY WOULD LOSE BIG AND

58
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,036
NANCY PELOSI WOULD BE THE

59
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:42,837
SPEAKER.

60
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,939
NOW THEY HAVE A SHOT BUT THEY'RE

61
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,608
CONCERNED ABOUT VOTER INTENSITY

62
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:47,842
ON THE LEFT IS STRONG.

63
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,844
HOW MEANINGFUL IS THAT

64
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:50,211
INTENSITY?

65
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,679
>> IT'S MEANINGFUL, PARTICULARLY

66
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,848
IN A MID-TERM ELECTION WHERE

67
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,850
IT'S ABOUT TURNING OUT THE BASE.

68
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,884
THE BECOMES HAVE HAD AN

69
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:57,552
ADVANTAGE THERE.

70
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,020
BUT BACK TO THE CNN POLL.

71
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,087
THAT WAS ANOTHER FINDING THAT

72
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,656
WAS DISTURBING FOR DEMOCRATS.

73
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:02,890
THEY SHOWED THE REPUBLICAN

74
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,058
INTENSITY IS UP NOW AND MATCHING

75
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,660
THE LEVEL OF THE DEMOCRATS.

76
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,228
IF THAT'S THE CASE, IT'S NOT AT

77
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,562
ALL A SURE BET THAT DEMOCRATS

78
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,232
WOULD TAKE BACK THE HOUSE IN

79
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:11,599
NOVEMBER.

80
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,167
>> Tucker: A LITTLE CONFUSING IN

81
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,468
TRUMP'S PERSONAL APPROVAL

82
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,970
NUMBERS ARE CONFUSING GIVEN THE

83
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,072
STORMY DANIELS STORY, WHICH IS

84
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,074
THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STORY

85
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:21,108
EVER COVERED BY THE AMERICAN

86
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,910
NEWS MEDIA, HAS DOMINATED THE

87
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,311
COVERAGE FOR THE PAST THREE OR

88
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,647
FOUR WEEKS, MONTHS, I DON'T KNOW

89
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,115
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN.

90
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,383
THAT HASN'T HAD AN EFFECT.

91
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,150
>> NO.

92
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,519
IN FACT, IT'S THE OPPOSITE,

93
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:32,853
TUCKER.

94
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,988
IN MID DECEMBER WAS TRUMP'S LOW

95
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,858
POINT IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS

96
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:38,225
RATING.

97
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,128
HIS AVERAGE WAS 37.

98
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,230
HE'S AT 43.4.

99
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,631
HE'S GAINED 6 1/2 POINTS OVER

100
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,033
THE COURSE OF THAT PERIOD.

101
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,036
AS YOU MENTIONED, THE ENTIRE

102
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,704
TIME, IT'S THE STORMY DANIELS

103
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:51,071
ONSLAUGHT.

104
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,239
NOT ONLY HAS IT HURT HIS

105
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,807
NUMBERS, HIS NUMBERS HAVE BEEN

106
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,076
TICKING UPWARDS THE ENTIRE TIME.

107
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,510
AGAIN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT --

108
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,512
YOU SEE DEMOCRATS.

109
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,314
YOU TALK TO THEM.

110
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,283
THEY'RE ANNOYED BY THIS.

111
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,618
TALK TO NANCY PELOSI AND OTHERS,

112
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,986
THEY SAY IT'S DISTRACTING FROM

113
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:07,520
OUR MESSAGE.

114
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,123
THEY WANT TO REACH VOTERS.

115
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,425
VOTERS HAVE TUNED THAT OUT AND

116
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,426
PAYING ATTENTION TO THE OTHER

117
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,094
STUFF WHICH TRUMP HAS HAD A GOOD

118
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,095
FEW WEEKS.

119
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,063
>> Tucker: AMAZING.

120
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:17,797
THEIR MESSAGE.

121
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,265
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO

122
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,366
TELL ME WHAT THAT IS.

123
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,734
I APPRECIATE IT, TOM.

124
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:22,502
THANK YOU.

125
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,269
>> YOU BET.

126
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,270
>> Tucker: YOU JUST HEARD THE

127
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,372
NUMBERS ON THE UPCOMING ELECTION

128
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,373
ARE INTERESTING.

129
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,041
THE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL AHEAD

130
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,111
BUT NOT NEARLY AS POPULAR ACTION

131
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,480
THEY WERE SIX MONTHS AGO.

132
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,983
IT'S WEIRD THE PRESIDENT IS

133
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,584
UNLIKED BY HALF THE COUNTRY.

134
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,286
DEMOCRATS OUGHT TO BE WAY AHEAD.

135
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,288
AS YOU JUST HEARD, THEY'RE NOT.

136
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,022
WHY IS THAT?

137
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,925
COULD IT BE THAT FOR ALL THE

138
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,026
PROBLEMS THAT THE REPUBLICANS

139
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,427
HAVE, AND THEY'RE REAL,

140
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:52,398
DEMOCRATS ARE PERCEIVED AS LESS

141
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:52,765
APPEALING?

142
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:53,466
LOOKS THAT WAY.

143
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,233
THE QUESTION IS WHY.

144
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,534
WE HAVE THEORIES.

145
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,969
WE CAN SHOW YOU A MILLION

146
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:57,636
EXAMPLES.

147
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,938
HERE'S ONE FROM YESTERDAY THAT

148
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,072
CAME TO MIND.

149
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,242
WATCH AS THIS MSNBC PANEL, WHICH

150
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,110
IS CLOSE TO A DEMOCRATIC PARTY

151
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,479
FOCUS GROUP YOU'LL FIND, GUSHES

152
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,081
OVER THE PORN LAWYER WHOSE EYES

153
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,750
ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.

154
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,085
WATCH THIS.

155
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:16,288
>> MICHAEL AVANETTI IS A BEAST.

156
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,856
>> HE'S A BEAST.

157
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,324
HE KEEPS POPPING DONALD TRUMP

158
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:22,594
AND ALL OF HIS FOLKS IN THE

159
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:22,928
MOUTH.

160
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:25,030
JOHN MEACHEM SAYS HE MAY BE THE

161
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,199
SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC.

162
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,534
>> HE KILLED THE NEWS OF THE

163
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,835
IRAN DEAL IN ONE BIG STROKE.

164
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,938
HE IS A MASTER OF THE MEDIA

165
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:33,772
CYCLE.

166
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:38,610
>> I OWE MICHAEL AVANETTI AN

167
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:38,944
APOLOGY.

168
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,412
I SAID I'VE SEEN YOU EVERYWHERE.

169
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:41,513
I WAS WRONG, BROTHER.

170
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:43,549
YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY.

171
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,349
THE DEMOCRATS COULD LEARN

172
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,517
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

173
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:48,687
YOU'RE MESSING WITH TRUMP A LOT

174
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,389
MORE THAN THEY ARE.

175
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,090
>> Tucker: HERE'S A POLITICAL

176
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:52,624
RULE OF THEM.

177
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,893
IN THE CREEPY PORN LAWYER IS THE

178
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,562
SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC IN YOUR

179
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,730
VIEW, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT TRYING

180
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,332
VERY HARD TO MIDDLE AMERICA.

181
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:00,866
DEMOCRATS ARE NOT.

182
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,569
IN THE LAST 1 1/2 YEARS, THE

183
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,770
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS DOUBLED

184
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,272
DOWN ON EVER REBEHAVIOR THAT GOT

185
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:10,242
TRUMP ELECTED IN THE FIRST

186
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:10,642
PLACE.

187
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:13,378
THEY PREFER ILLEGALS TO U.S.

188
00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:13,745
CITIZENS.

189
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:14,479
THEY'RE OPEN ABOUT IT.

190
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,815
IN SCHOOLS AND SPORTS, THE

191
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,650
MILITARY, THEY DENOUNCE THE IDEA

192
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,485
OF BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

193
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:21,286
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.

194
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,690
THAT SOMETHING THAT EVERY

195
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,126
CULTURE FROM ANCIENT EGYPT

196
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:28,527
UNDERSTAND.

197
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,562
TWO NIGHTS AGO, "THE NEW YORK

198
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,630
TIMES" CRITICIZED MIKE POMPEO

199
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,898
AND HIS TRIP TO NORTH KOREA.

200
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:36,134
THEY RAN THE HEADLINE, AT A KEY

201
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,769
MOMENT, TRUMP'S TOP DIPLOMAT IS

202
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,404
A THOUSAND MILES AWAY LIKE IT'S

203
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:39,805
A SIN.

204
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,673
THE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT IS TO

205
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:42,808
SECURITY THE RELEASE OF THREE

206
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:43,642
AMERICAN PRISONERS.

207
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:46,011
THE TIMES IS NOT IMPRESSED BY

208
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:46,311
THAT.

209
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:47,446
MIKE POMPEO WORKS FOR TRUMP SO

210
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,715
IT MUST BE BAD.

211
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:54,486
WHAT EVER ELSE HE'S DONE, TRUMP

212
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:56,588
HAS DRIVEN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

213
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,690
OFF THE DEEP END AND IT'S

214
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,391
SHOWING IN THE POLLS.

215
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,826
AND CHRISTY, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND

216
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,962
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY A LONG

217
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:04,263
TIME.

218
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,231
SHE JOINS US TONIGHT.

219
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:11,103
YOU'VE HEARD TOM BEVINS SAYING

220
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:14,172
THEIR MESSAGE IS NOT GETTING

221
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:14,539
AUTOMATIC.

222
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,574
TRUTH IS IT'S BAD.

223
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,142
IT'S MORE OF AN ANIMAL REACTION.

224
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,844
>> WHATEVER THE MESSAGE IS, IT'S

225
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:19,311
WORKING.

226
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,846
LOOK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL AND

227
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,315
STATE ELECTIONS SINCE NOVEMBER

228
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:24,249
2016.

229
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,285
DEMOCRATS HAVE FLIPPED 40 PLUS

230
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,552
SEATS AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE.

231
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:28,787
OFTEN IN DISTRICTS WHERE TRUMP

232
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:32,824
WON BY 20 OR 30 POINTS.

233
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,460
SO WE CAN QUIBBLE AND THE

234
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,162
MESSAGE BUT WE CAN'T QUIBBLE

235
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:38,430
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORKING.

236
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,999
IT CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE.

237
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,901
>> Tucker: TO SOME EXTENT, TRUMP

238
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:46,204
IS LOATHED BY HALF THE

239
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:46,605
POPULATION.

240
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,874
IT'S HIS FIRST MID-TERM.

241
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:50,108
HISTORICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO

242
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,076
GET SEATS.

243
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,511
THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS THE

244
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:52,811
WAVE.

245
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,446
ONE OF THE MESSAGES IS, THERE'S

246
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,647
NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

247
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:56,415
SEXES.

248
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,617
BIOLOGICAL REALITY IS LIKE FAKE.

249
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,419
>> NOBODY IS SAYING THAT.

250
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,288
>> Tucker: WE NEED TO REORGANIZE

251
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:03,622
SOCIETY.

252
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:06,625
IT'S MORE RADICAL THAN ANYTHING

253
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,326
TRUMP HAS SAID.

254
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,727
>> SUGGEST YOU TO POINT ME TO

255
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,496
THE CANDIDATE IS SAYING THAT.

256
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:12,431
DEMOCRATS ARE BEING

257
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:12,898
REASONABLE --

258
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,066
>> Tucker: WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE

259
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,067
FOR A DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR

260
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,835
OFFICE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

261
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,004
TO SAY THERE'S TWO BIOLOGICAL

262
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,138
SEXES, MALE AND FEMALE?

263
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:20,939
THAT'S IT.

264
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:21,940
IF YOU SAID THAT --

265
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,308
>> I WOULD SUGGEST THEY TALK

266
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:24,109
ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

267
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:24,876
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

268
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:25,911
ARE YOU JOKING?

269
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,346
THEY'RE THE ONES PUSHING THE

270
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,247
CHANGES ON THE REST OF US,

271
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,048
INCLUDING BATHROOM THING.

272
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,249
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT IN THE

273
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:31,917
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

274
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,118
I'M SERIOUS.

275
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,786
>> IT'S REPUBLICANS DOING THE

276
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:36,989
BATHROOM THING.

277
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,590
NORTH CAROLINA, THAT WAS A

278
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,491
ENTIRELY --

279
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:40,959
>> Tucker: NOBODY IMAGINED THERE

280
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,028
WERE MORE THAN TWO SEXES UNTIL

281
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:43,929
20 MINUTES AGO.

282
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,364
IT WAS DEMOCRATS.

283
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,599
IT'S A BIG CHANGE.

284
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,368
MAYBE BIOLOGY ISN'TS REAL.

285
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,836
IT'S NOT A MAINSTREAM POSITION.

286
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,237
THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING

287
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:52,938
ABOUT IT.

288
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:53,705
DOES IT HELP?

289
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,807
>> IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE

290
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,742
ARGUMENTS THIS DEMOCRATS SHOULD

291
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,145
OR SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ANT

292
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,280
IMPEACHMENT, STORMY DANIELS AND

293
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,648
HER LAWYER.

294
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,517
WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

295
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,852
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO.

296
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:07,652
THERE'S NO MAINSTREAM

297
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:08,153
CANDIDATE --

298
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,087
>> Tucker: REALLY?

299
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,889
YOU CAN SAY AS A DEMOCRAT --

300
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:11,256
SERIOUS.

301
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,859
I THINK IT'S RE-ORDERING SOCIETY

302
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:14,893
IS A BIG DEAL.

303
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,429
AND PRETENDING BIOLOGY IS FAKE,

304
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:17,696
TOO.

305
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,064
YOU COULD HAVE A DEMOCRATIC

306
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,332
CANDIDATE SAYING THERE'S TWO

307
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,366
BIOLOGICAL SEXES AND HE COULD

308
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,734
GET AWAY WITH THAT?

309
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,136
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE

310
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,570
BEEN IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

311
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,872
I THINK AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK BACK

312
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,807
TO THE WAYS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE

313
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,008
BEEN PERFORMING UP TO THIS

314
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,810
POINTS, WHATEVER IT IS THAT

315
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,745
THEY'RE DOING IS WORKING.

316
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,447
THERE'S FAR NOR ENERGY, THERE'S

317
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,349
MORE SMALL DOLLAR DONATIONS AND

318
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,683
THAT LEADS TO MORE VOLUNTEERS

319
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,053
AND LEADS TO A BETTER SLATE OF

320
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,087
CANDIDATES IN THE DEMOCRATIC

321
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:42,386
PARTY.

322
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:44,990
>> Tucker: A LOT OF IT IS TRUE.

323
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,657
YOU'RE RIGHT.

324
00:08:45,657 --> 00:00:00,000
PROBABLY MORE ENERGY AND ALL
