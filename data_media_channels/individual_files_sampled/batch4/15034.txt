comrades I have some very sad news to report George cklohm are America's most beloved communists professor who's made such erudite remarks as all I want for Christmas is white genocide and the Las Vegas Massacre is what happens when white people don't get what they want is no longer teaching at Drexel University why did this great 21st century Trotsky leave us let's find out Drexel University placed tenured politics professor Sakura Lamar on leave in October after he blamed Las Vegas massacre on white supremacist patriarchy citing safety concerns and threats the professor had received directs will let him continue teaching a couple weeks later but only remotely fast forward to December 28th Sakura Lamar announces he won't work at Drexel in 2018 the former professor said after nearly a year of harassment by right-wing white supremacist and media outlets and intranet mobs after death threats and threats of violence directed against me and my family my situation has become unsustainable wow this guy's a Spin Master no one condones threats of course but right-wing white supremacist media outlets what's funny about secure loz coverage is that a lot of it was just professor said X there's no commentary needed for people to see how crazy it is for you to blame mass murder on whiteness sicker ello is it a coincidence that every term that sounds like that last name is foul sicko cicada sickle and Hammer anyways at the end of the day the former professor is a hypocrite after Drexel kicked him off campus he positioned himself as a champion for academic freedom but he said something very different a few months beforehand on Tucker Carlson's show I wonder if you see something inconsistent with someone who teaches a university dedicated the idea of the open exchange of ideas calling for ideas he disagrees with to be shut down I think we should be clear that universities are actually spaces for rational ideas for arguments that are based in fact in evidence and the reality is that Charles Murray has never based his arguments in evidence or facts he has never passed any kind of rigorous academic you know academic examination of those ideas ah so charles Murray or anyone who hasn't received the blessing of academic peer review isn't qualified for academic freedom unlike this peer reviewed essay on feminist glaciers or this one in which a PhD student explains his trans-species hippopotamus identity time after time Sakura Lamarr has demonstrated that if the opinion expressed doesn't fit his worldview he will first misrepresent it and then not the same protections as other free speech the former professor also seems to thank whiteness a skin color the last time I checked is an ideology like radical Islam you know whiteness is never seen as a cause in and of itself of these kinds of massacres of you know other other forms of violence despite the fact that whiteness is a structure of privilege and it's a structure of power in this structure that when when it feels threatened you know lashes out this confusion here is priceless like hmm why will the racist media just establish people's motives based on how much melanin is in their skin oh gee I don't know Georgie maybe because that would be racist it really seems like an Tifa fanboy George isn't very fond of American values or the people who defend them in March the former professor tweeted some guy gave up his first-class seat to it for a uniformed soldier people are thanking him I'm trying not to vomit or yell about Mosel you know I keep referring to cigarillo as former professor while he's no longer professor George kicked off the new year by announcing that he'd be joining the hemispheric Institute of performance and politics at New York University as a visiting scholar the Institute apparently meshes scholarship politics and artistic expression together to investigate embodied practice performance as the vehicle for the creation of new meaning and the transmission of cultural values memory and identity that sounds totally legitimate drexel meanwhile praised George for being an outstanding classroom teacher I don't know if he's outstanding but I do know that at least for now he's standing outside of the classroom for campus unmasked I'm rob shamrock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm
