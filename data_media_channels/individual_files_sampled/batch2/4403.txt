17 years ago today the world changed this morning the nation remembers that Tuesday morning when thousands of people showed up at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon for work hundreds of firefighters cops and EMTs showed up for their shifts hundreds of passengers boarded their flights none of them knew they wouldn't live past 10 a.m. and on the solemn morning the director of the FBI talked about the evolving terror threat as it stands today we're also very focused now on homegrown violent extremists which are people who are largely here already in the United States big cities small towns coast-to-coast and these are people who are largely radicalized online we had about thousand investigations into just these homegrown violent extremists that's out of about 5,000 terrorism investigation doesn't include Isis does include al-qaeda it doesn't include domestic terrorism even this is a significant issue we had about a hundred and twenty terrorism related arrests last year alone that's just in the arrest context I want to bring you an MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nest he spent decades in the Navy and in counterterrorism and NBC News intelligence and national security reporter Kendall a nyan cat let me start with you listening to the FBI director talking about the the shift in threat what do you make of that it's absolutely what I've seen over my career covering intelligence Isis spent almost all my time focused on al-qaeda and drone strikes in Pakistan and the latest developments and it's really faded as an issue because al-qaeda does not have the capability people at Christopher ray tell us to mount a complicated 9/11 style attack and so when Ibrahim Al Asiri the master bomb maker was reported killed by the CIA a few weeks ago it wasn't even the top story of the day it would have been several years ago and that's I think that's good news now the disturbing news as Christopher ray just told us is that there's this homegrown threat there these 5,000 open FBI investigations and we've seen those attacks that have killed a lot of people but they are not an existential threat to the United States and Malcolm you unfortunately have been with me almost every time we have covered one of those what we call homegrown attacks or sort of less organized attacks and in most cases they don't rise as Ken says to the level of existential does that mean we should feel safer today than we did 17 years ago only to a certain extent I think a better way to look at these attacks is to call them aspirational attacks this is where people have just been infused with the belief that if they carry out some form of terrorism whether it's planning a bombing or getting a knife or getting a car that they can affect the world at their own level or at least the news media output for a day or two and this is what the FBI has to deal with you know back in the the 80s in the the ER we used to call the good old days of terrorism where all terrorist groups were cells and every once in a while you would have the lone wolf guy come up like the universe groups like al Qaeda Isis even right-wing extremists in the United States who are organized they get taken down very quickly but for now I think what we're finding is that the world of terrorism has diffused from these these these silos down to the individual and it's much harder to catch ken ever since 9/11 and the 9/11 Commission and all the information that has come out we've learned that there were intelligence community failings it wasn't we had more information than we we knew how to communicate and do with but we actually knew enough that if we were firing on all cylinders 9/11 probably could have been prevented how do you look at where we are today with respect to our intelligence gathering and sharing between our various intelligence agencies well look I think the United States has spent billions of dollars and has flooded the zone on terrorism and has surveillance and has analysts looking at this problem from every angle such that the people I talk to do not think that al Qaeda could carry out a similar attack it would just it would be detected yeah but you've seen that failure of imagination in other areas perhaps the Russia intervention in our politics so it's still an issue in terms of intelligence failure but on terrorism it seems like you know we don't know we don't know right but when I talk to officials privately they say look we've made huge progress on this we turn a corner we can't say that publicly though because an attack could come right and then everybody else I didn't you say you had all the information but now come one thing we know from 911 prior to 9/11 is our intelligence bodies weren't sharing important information that could have helped figure out 9/11 before it happened well that's true and but you have to understand pre 9/11 and many people don't understand this Laurens right did a good job and yes in his his book on the tower living town there was a right the looming towers there was an enormous effort going on in secret the secret war against al-qaeda that started in 2005/2006 Iran an al-qaeda simulation group for special operations Tier one operators in Coronado between ninety two thousand I'm sorry 1997 and 2001 we were on top of that mission what we were not on top of was at the national level the belief that these people were would carry out a strategic level attack intended to completely change the fabric of the world and that's what they did but at the tactical level we had seen aircraft as weapons systems as a viable attack methodology the Israelis shot down Alivia airline airliner in the in the 1970s believing that that's exactly what it was people flew airplanes into the White House so it wasn't so much a failure of intelligence and intelligence sharing now I'll be honest I think as soon as the bush crew got on board their mindset shifted to China they threw terrorism right out the window and I'm sorry but it did lead to some of the the failings that we had hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button
