1
00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:02,314
THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IS

2
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:02,648
MISSING.

3
00:00:02,648 --> 00:00:04,783
AND SO ARE HIS VOTERS.

4
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:09,021
AND THAT IS THE ANGLE.

5
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:11,090
IF CLINTON GOT THAT UPSET

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,093
DISCUSSING LEWINSKY, IMAGINE

7
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:14,827
"THE TODAY SHOW" HAD ASKED ABOUT

8
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:16,829
THE WOMEN WHO TOLD HIM NO.

9
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:20,432
JOINING US NOW ARE KATHLEEN

10
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:22,234
WILLEY AND JUANITA BROADDRICK,

11
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:23,335
AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "YOU

12
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:26,372
BETTER PUT SOME ICE ON THAT: HOW

13
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:30,276
I SURVIVED BEING RAPED BY

14
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:30,910
BILL CLINTON."

15
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,911
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU ALL

16
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,980
DAY, AND ALSO, PAULA.

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,416
JUANITA, I WANT TO START WITH

18
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:37,683
YOU.

19
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,752
BILL CLINTON DID APPROACH YOU,

20
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:43,923
DID HE NOT, IN 1992, TO

21
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:44,290
APOLOGIZE?

22
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,692
>> YEAH.

23
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:47,459
YES.

24
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:47,860
HE DID.

25
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,194
IT WAS IN 1991.

26
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:51,063
I WAS IN LITTLE ROCK AT A

27
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,832
NURSING HOME SEMINAR AND SOMEONE

28
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:55,134
COMES TO THE DOOR AND SAYS, I

29
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:56,201
WANTED IN THE HALLWAY.

30
00:00:56,201 --> 00:01:00,606
I GO OUT AND THE MAN POINTS DOWN

31
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:01,373
AROUND THE CORNER BY THE

32
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:02,641
ELEVATOR.

33
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,342
AND SO I GO DOWN THERE.

34
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:07,279
AS I ROUND THE CORNER, THERE

35
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:08,047
STANDS BILL CLINTON WITH TWO OF

36
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:08,747
HIS ARKANSAS STATE POLICE

37
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:10,249
GUARDS.

38
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,786
AND HE RUSHES OVER TO ME AND HE

39
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:17,089
STARTS THIS PROFUSE APOLOGY AND

40
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:19,091
SAYING, I'M SO SORRY FOR WHAT I

41
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:20,859
DID, I AM A CHANGED MAN.

42
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,262
I'M JUST NOT THE MAN I USED TO

43
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:23,662
BE.

44
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:26,065
EVEN SAID, I'M A FAMILY MAN NOW.

45
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:29,268
AND I JUST LOOKED AT HIM, LAURA,

46
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:31,704
AND I -- I WAS JUST

47
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:32,137
FLABBERGASTED.

48
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:35,674
I SAID, YOU GO TO HELL.

49
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:36,241
I WALKED OFF.

50
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,910
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.

51
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,712
AND THE NURSES WHO WERE WITH ME

52
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:41,513
FOLLOWED ME OUT.

53
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:43,315
AND THEY CAME OVER TO ME AND

54
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,084
THEY SAID, WHAT DID HE WANT?

55
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:46,885
AND I TOLD THEM.

56
00:01:46,885 --> 00:01:48,887
AND THEN I BEGAN TO FEEL A

57
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,055
LITTLE BAD THAT I HAD SAID THAT,

58
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:53,359
I KEPT THINKING, WELL, MAYBE HE

59
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,461
REALLY MEANT THAT, MAYBE HE

60
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:56,061
REALLY WAS APOLOGIZING.

61
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:57,363
>> Laura: THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

62
00:01:57,363 --> 00:02:00,265
THEN YOU REALIZED...

63
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:01,634
FAST-FORWARD, HE WAS RUNNING FOR

64
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:02,768
PRESIDENT AND YOU WERE PERHAPS

65
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:05,237
GOING TO BE AN OBSTACLE FOR THAT

66
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:05,704
GOING TO BE AN OBSTACLE FOR THA

67
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,038
THAT?

68
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:06,772
>> RIGHT.

69
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:08,473
THAT'S EXACTLY IT -- A WEAK

70
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:11,644
LEADER AFTER HE APOLOGIZED,

71
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:14,079
HE RESPONDED HE WAS RUNNING FOR

72
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,681
PRESIDENT.

73
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:16,382
>> Laura: A WEEK LATER

74
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:18,350
QUESTION MIKE THAT'S REALLY

75
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,684
SUBTLE.

76
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:21,520
KATHLEEN WILEY, YOU WATCH THAT

77
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,054
INTERVIEW.

78
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,489
I'VE GOT TO SAY, I'M ALWAYS DONE

79
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:24,256
THAT.

80
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:24,790
WHY AM I STUNNED?

81
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,760
HE HAS NOT LEARNED ANYTHING

82
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,795
ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE.

83
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:32,865
HE'S ACTUALLY A SMART GUY.

84
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:33,432
I'M ALMOST SPEECHLESS.

85
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,868
YOUR REACTION?

86
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,469
>> I'M SPEECHLESS TOO.

87
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:38,470
I WAS OUTRAGED.

88
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,538
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE WORDS

89
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,773
THAT WERE COMING OUT OF HIS

90
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:41,073
MOUTH.

91
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:44,176
HE WAS SO ARROGANT AND POMPOUS

92
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:47,279
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

93
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,614
I THINK HE ACTUALLY DOES BELIEVE

94
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:49,615
THAT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

95
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,784
WRONG.

96
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:57,623
AND JUST A BLANKET APOLOGY.

97
00:02:57,623 --> 00:02:58,757
HE HAS APOLOGIZE TO PEOPLE THAT

98
00:02:58,757 --> 00:02:59,224
HE WORKED WITH.

99
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,827
AND THE PEOPLE HE DESTROYED, THE

100
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:03,862
WOMEN HE DESTROYED, HE HAS

101
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,197
APOLOGIZED TO ME, HE HAS NOT

102
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:09,068
APOLOGIZED TO PAULA, HE

103
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:12,071
APOLOGIZED TO JUANITA, BUT THERE

104
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,106
WAS A PURPOSE FOR THAT.

105
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,475
AND HE HASN'T APOLOGIZED TO

106
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,777
LESLIE OR NUMEROUS OTHER WOMEN

107
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:19,912
WHO HAVE COME FORWARD AND SAY

108
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,280
THEY TOLD STORIES ABOUT HIM.

109
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,714
HE NEVER WILL.

110
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:23,716
HE DOESN'T GET IT.

111
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,517
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

112
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:27,286
>> Laura: HE SEEMS TO THINK --

113
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:29,755
HE HANDLED IT WELL.

114
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,491
TO WATCH THAT INTERVIEW, HE

115
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:33,158
DIDN'T SAY HE WOULD'VE DONE

116
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:36,061
ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY.

117
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:36,862
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES IN

118
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:37,663
THEIR LIFE.

119
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:39,631
COULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE, WOULD

120
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:39,932
HAVE.

121
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:43,469
LORD KNOWS WE ALL DO.

122
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,037
BUT 20 YEARS LATER TO SAY, YOU

123
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:47,272
KNOW, I WISH I COULD TURN BACK

124
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:48,140
THE CLOCK AND, YOU KNOW, SHOW

125
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,042
BETTER JUDGMENT.

126
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,878
BUT, I MEAN -- I DO THAT 50

127
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:53,278
TIMES A DAY.

128
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:54,747
"WHY DID I DO THAT" -- IT'S A

129
00:03:54,747 --> 00:04:00,052
LITTLE STRANGE.

130
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:02,654
ON CNN, OFFERED SOMEWHAT TEPID

131
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:03,388
CRITIQUE OF THIS PERFORMANCE.

132
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:06,091
LET'S WATCH.

133
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:08,026
>> THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A MORE

134
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:10,028
PRACTICE ANSWER, OR ONE, I WOULD

135
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:10,863
THINK, ALLUDED TO THE NOTION

136
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:11,797
THAT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE

137
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:14,266
PAST 20 YEARS.

138
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,134
OBVIOUSLY, THE RULES WERE

139
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,334
DIFFERENT AND HE WOULD'VE DONE

140
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,269
SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY TODAY OR

141
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,903
HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING

142
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:20,639
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT IT TODAY.

143
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,807
>> Laura: HE COULD HAVE HAD A

144
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:27,846
MORE PRACTICE ANSWER.

145
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:28,180
JUANITA.

146
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,281
>> MY GOD...

147
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:30,616
BE WHEN HE COULD'VE ALSO NOT

148
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:32,050
PORTRAYED HIMSELF AS A VICTIM.

149
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,453
HOW DOES HE BECOME THE VICTIM IN

150
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:34,887
ALL OF THIS?

151
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:35,854
>> I KNOW!

152
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:36,188
I KNOW.

153
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:39,258
I SAW THIS DECREPIT, ANGRY OLD

154
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:41,794
MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO PLAY THE

155
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:43,829
VICTIM CARD.

156
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,599
THE SAME MAN WHO 40 YEARS AGO

157
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,233
RAPED ME.

158
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,804
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

159
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,005
>> Laura: KATHLEEN, IT

160
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,241
WOULD'VE BEEN REALLY AMAZING --

161
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,177
I AM SHOCKED THAT MELVIN ASKED

162
00:04:58,177 --> 00:04:59,044
THESE QUESTIONS.

163
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,046
>> I AM TOO.

164
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,147
>> Laura: IT WOULD'VE BEEN

165
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:03,715
REALLY AMAZING IF HE ASKED ABOUT

166
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:07,219
WANITA, YOU, THE OTHERS, BUT HE

167
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:07,886
FOCUSED ON MONICA WILENSKY

168
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,655
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE IMPEACHMENT

169
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:10,222
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE IMPEACHMEN.

170
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,490
EVEN JOE LOCKHART -- LET'S PLAY

171
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,060
THIS QUICKLY.

172
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,828
JOE LOCKHART, FORMER WHITE HOUSE

173
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:16,495
PRESS SECRETARY SAID THAT

174
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:16,862
YESTERDAY.

175
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:20,833
LET'S WATCH.

176
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:21,567
>> HIGHLIGHTS THE VAST

177
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,669
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS IT

178
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:24,469
LIKE 20 YEARS AGO OR TODAY.

179
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:27,639
IN THE INTERVIEW, HE SUCCUMBED

180
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,875
TO BEING THE VICTIM AND FEELING

181
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,743
VICTIMIZED.

182
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:34,780
>> Laura: VICTIMIZED, KATHLEEN

183
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,147
KATHLEEN.

184
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:38,617
>> HE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE

185
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:39,218
$16 MILLION IN DEBT?

186
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,652
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT BEING IN

187
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:41,954
DEBT IS LIGHT AND NOT BEING ABLE

188
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:43,889
TO GET A MEANINGFUL JOB AFTER

189
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,657
BEING THROUGH ALL OF THAT.

190
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:46,358
HE HIRED ALL THESE WOMEN WHO

191
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:51,096
WORKED IN HIS OFFICE AND HAS A

192
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:53,465
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.

193
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,200
HE HAD A LOT OF WOMEN AROUND SO

194
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,136
HE COULD, YOU KNOW, ASSAULT THEM

195
00:05:58,136 --> 00:05:58,637
HE COULD, YOU KNOW, ASSAULT THE

196
00:05:58,637 --> 00:05:59,671
THEM.

197
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:01,440
THERE IS NO SEXUAL HARASSMENT

198
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,974
POLICY IN ARKANSAS.

199
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:06,078
THERE NEVER WAS ONE.

200
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:06,812
>> Laura: KATHLEEN, IF HE HAD

201
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:09,948
CALLED YOU TODAY AND SAID, LOOK,

202
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:11,149
I KNOW IT CAME UP BAD IN THE

203
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,318
INTERVIEW, BUT I'M REALLY SORRY

204
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:14,720
FOR CAUSING YOU PAIN, SORRY FOR

205
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,656
WHAT I DID, WOULD YOU ACCEPT HIS

206
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:18,490
APOLOGY?

207
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:18,957
>> NO.

208
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,893
I TELL THEM THE SAME THING THAT

209
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,828
JUANITA TOLD HIM.

210
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:24,129
>> Laura: WHICH WOULD BE...

211
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:27,232
>> I WOULD TELL HIM TO GO TO

212
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:28,834
HELL.

213
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,636
>> Laura: JUANITA, SAME

214
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:31,003
QUESTION.

215
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,638
EVERYBODY CAN BE REDEEMED,

216
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:33,272
RIGHT?

217
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,806
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE IN

218
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:35,374
REDEMPTION, ALL OF US.

219
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:36,875
MOST OF US DO.

220
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,278
>> I DON'T BELIEVE -- I DON'T

221
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:40,012
BELIEVE THERE'S ANY REDEMPTION

222
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,079
IN REGARD TO BILL AND

223
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:41,546
HILLARY CLINTON.

224
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:43,548
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT.

225
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:44,783
I WOULD PROBABLY TELL HIM THE

226
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:47,252
SAME THING AGAIN TODAY.

227
00:06:47,252 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Laura: ALL RIGHT.
