1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
so I just finished my<font color="#CCCCCC"> workout and now</font>

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,950
I'm going to make a smoothie with some

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,960
protein powder<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try it out fail but a</font>

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,970
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are her commenting on</font>

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube lately saying things about like</font>

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,320
a whole food diet so I'm think I'm

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at up today see what that is all</font>

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,220
about because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds printing and the</font>

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,779
workout alone doesn't seem to be doing

10
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,970
enough for me so I want to add something

11
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:32,040
to it like a nutritional diet<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so i</font>

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,840
just did a bunch of research and it

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,700
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole food diet is</font>

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,739
basically just eating food in its

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,590
natural form like not eating process or

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,899
things are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> slap together package and</font>

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,879
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem like fruits and</font>

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,710
vegetables and all kinds of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could just get freshly and pick off</font>

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,690
of a plan needed type of the stuff or

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,210
eat beef this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bin like not pasteurized</font>

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,660
or he's just grass stuff like that so a

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,129
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying to watch</font>

24
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,260
forks to knives or knives and forks or

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,760
something and it's on netflix so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna go check that out miyota will give</font>

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,869
me a little more insight but it seems

28
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of those diets will end</font>

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,720
up costing you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money because</font>

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,280
you have to buy all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expensive stuff</font>

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
in the grocery store just finished

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,860
watching the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fork over knife documentary</font>

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,750
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting the stuff</font>

34
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,950
they had to say about the plant-based

35
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,860
ice the whole plant he says Vicki<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">of watched it and listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,159
time I Vicki I just listened I didn't

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,259
watch it so yeah she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was listening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,820
which there's nothing really to watch

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,189
just listening anyways so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

41
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,220
just eating vegetables no dairy no meat

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,009
trying to eat hold vegetables it saw

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,220
what i understand it a whole whole foods

44
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,450
diet is just becoming a vegetarian so

45
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,829
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and look up some recipes</font>

46
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:48,659
and stuff like that to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can</font>

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,520
incorporate some of the stuff into our

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,430
routine meals and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe gradually</font>

49
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,340
moving into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that type of diet but i</font>

50
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,659
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we could do it at cold</font>

51
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">turkey because it's hard with all these</font>

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">kids to be like here now try this</font>

53
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,659
entirely new meal because they're

54
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,490
probably won't like most of it

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,190
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think it's nearly</font>

56
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,340
impossible with kids to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because</font>

57
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,170
like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'd get enough food</font>

58
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,739
into them there have a good used to it I

59
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:17,970
honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think I get enough food</font>

60
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,080
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's why I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it over time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you can't just cold</font>

62
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,800
turkey weekend yeah it's impossible cuz

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,790
I mean I think they're pretty good

64
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">within their vegetables yeah is a leaky</font>

65
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,410
sink there's a plate of vegetables for

66
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,599
dinner yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly i mean like i don't</font>

67
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">know but I'm sure there's really</font>

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,959
creative ways to make the meals so if

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,530
gradually and you kind of come along the

76
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,330
journey with this hey guys what's up so

77
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am going to go and try and find some</font>

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,769
ingredients for one of these whole food

79
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,680
vegetable based diets so I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

80
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> make black brain like came and</font>

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,280
talked and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make black</font>

82
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,780
bean burritos so I doing some more

83
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,720
research and apparently you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do like</font>

84
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,640
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of different variations of this</font>

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,709
whole food thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of them</font>

86
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,959
involves eating meat but it has to be

87
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,290
meat then like has been pasteurized I

88
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,870
guess or hesitant I'm so bad at this has

89
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,570
to be meat that has eaten grass only and

90
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,579
like natural things you want everything

91
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,680
that you need to have eaten<font color="#E5E5E5"> natural</font>

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,720
things or to be naturally growing things

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,130
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want things that are</font>

94
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,160
processed or like given all kinds of

95
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,590
hormones to increase their body fat so

96
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,150
that there's more meat on them stuff

97
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,190
like that so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go try and</font>

98
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this meal because I figure out to</font>

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
make seven breakfast<font color="#E5E5E5"> meals seven lunch</font>

100
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,060
meals in seven dinner meals those are

101
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,859
the I need recipes for all those things

102
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:52,319

103
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,670
gonna go get the burrito stuff and I'm

104
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,639
