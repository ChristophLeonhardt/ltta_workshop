1
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:06,033
SO, MR. PRESIDENT, LET'S NOT

2
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:09,904
LOSE SIGHT OF THE OPPORTUNITY

3
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:10,438
BEFORE US.

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,343
THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN RULED BY

5
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:17,412
FEAR AND ANGER AND UNDERHANDED

6
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:21,182
GAMESMANSHIP FOR TOO LONG.

7
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:24,118
TIME FOR US TO STAND UP TO THIS

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:24,585
KIND OF THING.

9
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:27,388
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN

10
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,157
PEOPLE NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY

11
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:30,224
THESE TACTICS.

12
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:33,227
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN

13
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:35,396
PEOPLE TO UNDERSCORE THAT YOU

14
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:36,130
ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN

15
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:37,732
GUILTY.

16
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,535
IT'S THE SENATE THAT IS ON

17
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:41,869
TRIAL HERE, MR. PRESIDENT.

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,739
WHAT KIND OF IMAGE WILL WE

19
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,041
CONVEY TO THE PUBLIC?

20
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:51,012
CAN WE BE SCARED BY ALL THESE

21
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:53,147
PEOPLE RAMPAGING THROUGH THE

22
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:56,250
HALLS ACCOSTING MEMBERS AT

23
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,119
AIRPORTS, COMING TO THEIR HOMES?

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,188
THEY'RE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE

25
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:01,422
THE SENATE INTO DEFEATING A

26
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:05,059
GOOD MAN.

27
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,427
ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW THIS TO

28
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:09,464
HAPPEN?

29
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:19,674
IN THIS COUNTRY?

30
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:25,413
SO WE WILL NOT PRETEND THAT

31
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:27,315
PARTISAN HISTORY ONICS TAKE

32
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,417
AWAY THE BASIC FAIRNESS EVERY

33
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:30,852
AMERICAN DESERVES.

34
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:32,453
WE WILL NOT BE HOODWINKED BY

35
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:36,057
THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED HARD TO

36
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:39,460
SMEAR THIS GOOD MAN, TO DRAG

37
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:45,032
HIM THROUGH THE MUD.

38
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,467
AND WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK, THEY

39
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:48,236
TURNED ON A DIME AND STARTED

40
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:49,971
CLAIMING HIS REAL SIN WAS THAT

41
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:54,275
HE SPOKE UP TOO FORCEFULLY IN

42
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,977
DEFENSE OF HIS GOOD NAME AND

43
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:58,246
HIS FAMILY.

44
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:01,048
OH, THEY DECIDE HE DOESN'T HAVE

45
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,683
A JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT.

46
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:03,618
BECAUSE HE AGGRESSIVELY

47
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,991
DEFENDED HIS GOOD NAME.

48
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,593
AGAINST THIS OUTRAGEOUS SMEAR

49
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:14,362
CONDUCTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH

50
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:18,266
SENATE DEMOCRATS.

51
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:21,102
WHO AMONG US WOULD NOT HAVE

52
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:25,306
BEEN OUTRAGED BY HAVING A

53
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:29,544
LIFETIME RECORD DRUG THROUGH

54
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:34,882
THE MUD WITH ACCUSATIONS THAT

55
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:36,517
CANNOT BE PROVEN?

56
00:02:36,518 --> 00:02:37,718
AND A BLAITENT ATTEMPT TO

57
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,321
DECIDE ON THE PART OF SOME

58
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:44,091
SENATE DEMOCRATS THAT THE

59
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:45,726
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE NO

60
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:47,261
LONGER APPLIES IN THIS COUNTRY?

61
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:48,763
WHAT KIND OF PERSON COULDN'T

62
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:53,734
HAVE BEEN UPSET ABOUT THAT?

63
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,836
THEY CLAIM HE SPOKE TOO

64
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:56,504
FORCEFULLY IN DEFENSE OF

65
00:02:56,505 --> 00:03:00,775
HIMSELF?

66
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,844
AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF SUCH

67
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,146
OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR THAT CANNOT

68
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:08,449
BE PROVEN?

69
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,084
I ADMIRE HIM FOR STANDING UP

70
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,786
FOR HIMSELF AND STANDING UP FOR

71
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,588
HIS FAMILY.

72
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:16,157
I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF IT WERE

73
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:17,425
NOT DONE IN AN AGGRESSIVE

74
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:24,398
FASHION.

75
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,067
FOR GOODNESS SAKE.

76
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,702
SO LET'S RECLAIM THIS MOMENT

77
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:30,972
FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE, A CHANCE

78
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,607
TO ELEVATE A STUNNINGLY

79
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:34,308
TALENTED AND IMPRESSIVE JURIST

80
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:35,943
TO AN IMPORTANT OFFICE FOR

81
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:41,616
WHICH HE IS SO WELL QUALIFIED.

82
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:42,516
SO COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY

83
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:44,719
QUALIFIED.

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,787
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE

85
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:48,923
OUR GREAT NATION PRECISELY THE

86
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,258
KIND OF BRILLIANT, FAIR MINDED

87
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,426
AND COLLEGIAL SUPREME COURT

88
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:57,465
JUSTICE THAT THE COURT DESERVES.

89
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,567
THIS, MR. PRESIDENT, IS THE

90
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:03,804
GOOD THAT SENATORS WILL HAVE AN

91
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:04,505
OPPORTUNITY TO DO.

92
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:07,508
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO GOOD

93
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:10,711
HERE.

94
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:13,381
AND TO UNDERSCORE THE BASIC

95
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:17,885
TENET OF FAIRNESS IN OUR

96
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:18,219
COUNTRY.

97
00:04:18,220 --> 00:00:00,000
SO I FILE CLOTURE ON THE
