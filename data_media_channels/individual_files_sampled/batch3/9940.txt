ANYWHERE. JOHN ROBERTS STARTS US OFF WITH THE PRESIDENT'S PILL PLAN. THIS IS A DAY THAT THE MAJOR DRUG COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DREADING FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISEED TO PUT THE SCREWS TO THE BIG PHARMACEUTICAL AND BEGAN THAT TODAY. IN A WEEK WITH FOREIGN POLICY, PRESIDENT TRUMP TURNED TO DOMESTIC POLICIES TO MAKE GOOD ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS COSTS. MY ADMINISTRATION IS LAUNCHING THE MOST SWEEPING ACTION IN HISTORY TO LOWER THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HIS PLAN IS TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. ENCOURAGE INNOVATION. THE WHITE HOUSE CLAIMS THE U.S. SHOULDERS AN UNFAIR BURDEN OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS OTHER NATIONS FORCE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO DISCOUNT PRICES. JOHN KELLY SAID A BIG PROBLEM FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS MANY PEOPLE CAN'T FIT INTO SOCIETY. THEY ARE OVERWHELMING RULER PEOPLE. 4th TO 6th GREAT EDUCATIONS ARE THE NORM. THEY DON'T HAVE SKILLS. THE PRESIDENT'S FRUSTRATION OVER IMMIGRATION BOILED OVER IN WEDNESDAY'S CABINET MEETING. HE BERATE ED HE BERATE E HE BERATEDE HE BERATE HE BERATED HE BERATED N HE BERATED NIE HE BERATED NIELS HE BERATED NIELSEN HE BERATED NIELSEN A HE BERATED NIELSEN ABO HE BERATED NIELSEN ABOUT HE BERATED NIELSEN ABOUT W HE BERATED NIELSEN ABOUT WHY HE BERATED NIELSEN ABOUT WHY S HE BERATED NIELSEN ABOUT WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WERE ILLEGALLY STILL CROSSING THE BORDER. CHIEF OF STAFF KELLY TOLD FOX NEWS HE CALLED NIELSEN URGING HER NOT TO QUIET. QUIT. IT MAY NOT BE A CLOUD, BUT THE PRESIDENT IS EMBARRASSED WHEN WORLD LEADERS COME IN. NETANYAHU WAS HERE. THIS AFTERNOON KELLY INSISTED DISTRACTION IS A BETTER WAY TO CHARACTERIZE THE FACT OF THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION ON THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THE MICHAEL COHEN INVESTIGATION. THE CEO OF AT&T SAID THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT. AT&T HIRING MICHAEL COHEN WAS A BIG MISTAKE. RANDLE STEVENSON SAID ASSOCIATING WITH COHEN WAS A SERIOUS MISJUDGMENT. THE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS SAID THE COHEN CASE PROVES PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN'T BE BOUGHT. AT&T NEVER GOT GOVERNMENT APPROVAL FOR THE MERGER IT WAS SEEKING. THE PRESIDENT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY SPECIAL INTEREST. THIS IS DRAINING THE SWAMP. THE WHITE HOUSE REFUSEED TO APOLOGIZE TO JOHN McCAIN AFTER A STAFFER MADE A HEARTLESS COMMENT ABOUT HIM. SADLER SAID HE'S DYING ANYWAY. SADLER CALLED MCCAIN'S DAUGHTER TO APOLOGIZE BUT THE PRESS SECRETARY HAD NOTHING TO ADD TODAY. I WON'T VALIDATE A LEAK ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. ON DRUG PRICES, THE DRUG SECRETARIES PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO TAKE A BUSINESS APPROACH TO LOWER DRUG PRICES
