1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,600
WILL MITCH MCCONNELL BRING
THE GRAHAM CASSIDY HEALTHCARE

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,069
REPLACEMENT BOW TO A VOTE?

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:08,320
THAT
IS A QUESTION PEOPLE ARE ASKING

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,559
TODAY AFTER IT TURNS OUT THAT
JOHN MCCAIN MADE A VERY

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,590
TRANSPARENT AND OVERT STATEMENT
REGARDING WHAT HE PLANS ON

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,130
DOING WITH HIS VOTE.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,540
HE WILL NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE
GRAHAM CASSIDY PLAN.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,570
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME MORE
DETAILS.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:47,830
HE SAID, THIS IS A STATEMENT BY
JOHN MCCAIN.

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:01:00,120
JOHN 
MCCAIN IS FIRM IN HIS

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,200
DECISION.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,030
THE REASON WHY SENATE
REPUBLICANS ARE RUSHING TO VOTE

13
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,229
IS BECAUSE AFTER SEPTEMBER 30,
THEY WILL NEED MORE THAN A

14
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,369
SIMPLE MAJORITY IN ORDER TO
PASS.

15
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:27,979
SO 
IT 

16
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,829
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY
ARE GOING TO HAVE THE VOTES

17
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:30,829
NECESSARY.

18
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:35,891
FIRST OF ALL, RAND PAUL IS
AGAINST THE BILL BECAUSE HE

19
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:37,030
IS NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH.

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,800
HE WOULD LIKE TO GET MORE PEOPLE
OFF OF HEALTHCARE JUST TO

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,969
BE CLEAR.

22
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,929
AND MCCAIN COULDN'T BE CLEAR
THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE

23
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:46,929
FOR IT.

24
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,249
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THREE
REPUBLICANS, THEY

25
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,420
DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE THE VOTE.

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,079
BUT IS IT REALLY OVER?

27
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,469
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE RAND PAUL
HAS BEEN A SOLID NOTE THROUGHOUT

28
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,960
BECAUSE HE THINKS IT PERTAINS TO
MUCH TO OBAMA CARE.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,940
AND SUSAN COLLINS IS LEANING
AGAINST IT.

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,030
THE ONLY PERSON WHO I AM
POSITIVE WILL VOTE NO IS

31
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,700
SUSAN COLLINS.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,300
RAND PAUL WILL TWEAK IT OR
SOMETHING.

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,890
HE VOTED FOR THE OTHER ONE.

34
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,940
NOW, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME.

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,920
THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF
DOING IT AND RAN PAUL

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,810
PARTICULARLY OBJECTS TO THIS
WAY.

37
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:36,100
AND JOHN MCCAIN, I SENT A TEXT
AROUND THAT I WANTED $10 � I'M

38
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,440
NOT SAYING HE WILL VOTE FOR
IT, BUT NOW HE HAS SAID NO

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,250
WHICH THERE IS NO AMBIGUITY IN
THE STATEMENT.

40
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,320
BUT HE WILL EQUIVOCATE BECAUSE
AT SOME POINT IN THE NEXT WEEK

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,260
HE WILL SAY WELL, IF WE CAN GET
A RUSH SCORE I WANT TO SEE IT.

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,620
LIKE, HE WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT
PUTS HIM MAY BE BACK IN PLACE.

43
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,380
HE STILL MY VOTE NO AT THE END
BUT MY HUNCH IS HE WILL

44
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
EQUIVOCATE.

45
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,791
I THINK THERE IS ONE THING OR
ONE PERSON THAT JOHN MCCAIN

46
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,250
HATES MORE THAN THE AFFORDABLE
CARE ACT, AND THAT IS

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,250
DONALD TRUMP.

48
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,370
HE HATES DONALD TRUMP.

49
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,950
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN TO
THE WIRE I GUESS.

50
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,090
BUT HE MIGHT VOTE AGAINST HIS
FRIENDS, BUT HE MIGHT VOTE

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,480
LINDSEY GRAHAM.

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,360
SO HE WAS SAYING TO LINDSEY
GRAHAM LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO DO

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,630
THIS AT THE LAST SECOND AGAIN.

54
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,500
BUT YOU ARE MY FRIEND SO I'M
JUST TELLING YOU NOW, I AM

55
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
NOT THERE.

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,950
MAYBE THAT IS IT?

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,870
THE REASON THAT LINDSEY GRAHAM
IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS IS

58
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,560
TO GET JOHN MCCAIN'S VOTE.

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,180
AND LINDSEY GRAHAM'S LIFELONG
COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE.

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,390
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT.

61
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,390
AND THE DONORS REALLY WANT
THIS, THAT IS A DIFFERENT STORY.

62
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,120
AND PART OF THE REASON IS THAT
PEOPLE JUST NEVER TALK ABOUT THE

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,700
OTHER PART OF THE BILL WHERE IT
GIVES HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF

64
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:15,480
DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS TO THE RICH.

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,040
SO IN OTHER WORDS GIVE ME THE
TAX CUTS DAMMIT.

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,960
WHAT IPO YOU GUYS TO BE MY
REPRESENTATIVES, IF YOU WILL.

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,430
THAT LEADS TO THE REASON � THE
REASON I BRING THAT UP IS A

68
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,229
LEADS TO PART OF MY THEORY ABOUT
JOHN MCCAIN WHICH IS THAT IT IS

69
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,439
CONNECTED TO MY OVERALL THEORY
OF REVERSE POLITICS.

70
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,249
HE IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO
RUN AGAIN.

71
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:41,499
AND NOW HE IS UNTETHERED FROM
THE DONORS.

72
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:42,499
I LOVE IT.

73
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:46,699
THE MINUTE YOU DO THAT YOU CAN
VOTE YOUR CONVICTION AND DO

74
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,699
THE RIGHT WAY.

75
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,930
AND I THINK THAT IS PARTLY WHAT
IS HAPPENING RIGHT HERE.

76
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,629
THIS GETS TO WHAT WILL
ULTIMATELY BE OUR LONG

77
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:59,509
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INFLUENCE
OF MONEY IN POLITICS.

78
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:02,010
BUT THE DIRECT INFLUENCE.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,300
THROUGH BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN,
BARACK OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN

80
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,289
TEACH THESE GUYS LIKE YOU DON'T
NEED MONEY FROM EVERYBODY.

81
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,909
YOU CAN RAISE MONEY ELSEWHERE.

82
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:15,940
NO, IT DEFINITELY DID NOT.

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,520
I DON'T THINK I'M WRONG, AND
MAYBE BILL CASSIDY CAN'T RAISE

84
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,949
MONEY THAT WAY.

85
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,919
IT LOOKS LIKE THE CLIENT HAS YET
TO PUT THE MAKE UPON.

86
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,219
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT
DESCRIPTION OF BILL CASSIDY.

87
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:36,539
IF THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT
DYNAMICS AT PLAY HERE, ONE

88
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,099
IS BERNIE SANDERS RAN FOR
PRESIDENT.

89
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,719
SO YOU GET A TON OF FREE MEDIA.

90
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,169
BILL CASSIDY AND OTHERS THAT
WERE RUNNING IN THE RACE IN

91
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,979
LOUISIANA ARE NOT GOING TO GET
FREE MEDIA SO THEY NEED �

92
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:52,979
THEY THINK THEY NEED THE DONOR
MINUTES WON.

93
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,699
THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS GO
GET SMALL DONORS BECAUSE

94
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:05,029
THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR SMALL
DONORS.

95
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:09,539
CASSIDY HAS NEVER DONE THAT IN
HIS CAREER, SO THEY CAN

96
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,650
POSSIBLY RAISE THE KIND OF SMALL
DONOR MONEY THAT THEY NEED.

97
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,969
DID ANYONE LEARN A LESSON FROM
BERNIE SANDERS CAMP?

98
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:16,969
YEAH.

99
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:17,969
I DID.

100
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,610
THAT IS WHY WE STARTED JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS WHICH IS RELYING

101
00:06:19,610 --> 00:00:00,000
ON SMALL DONORS.
