I have a great weekend and thanks to you at home for joining us this hour as mentioned Rachel does have the night off we have a lot of interesting stuff to get to tonight there is so much happening this Friday in the news a blistering critique came through today of the Trump administration's attempts to reunite hundreds of the families that separated along the border Chris was just reporting on this a court order does require it and we will be joined tonight by reporter Jacob Soboroff to explain what set that federal judge off today meanwhile Donald Trump is back at his own Golf Club in New Jersey he's gonna stay there for two more weeks we learned that from Rudy Giuliani who now claims Trump will once and for all announce whether he's doing that much-discussed interview with special counsel Bob Muller who himself was busy today wrapping the first week of the trial of Trump campaign chairman Paul mana for that's not even the only legal news you remember all that drama over the first publication to ever release the now infamous Trump Russia dossier it was the website BuzzFeed they made the choice lawsuits ensued well late today I don't know if you've heard about this yet but it's potentially significant news broke there is a judge who's actually gonna greenlight fascinating fact finding in this case BuzzFeed will be able to pursue legally James Comey and other key federal officials to depose them under oath all of this to address some of the questions we've all been wondering like how did that dossier make its way not only into the federal government in the FBI but when exactly did President Barack Obama learn about its explosive contents and the allegations about a man who would replace him Donald Trump and so we begin looking at this steel dossier right now all of this of course comes from when the FBI announced that it was releasing some records between the agency and Christopher's Steele the author 71 pages come out and the former British intelligence officer is actually not referred to technically by his name but by the letters C HS confidential human source now the trove of documents detail reports of payments to steel mostly redacted you can see there that's a lot of white space there are two exceptions the final page is information from a document from February 2016 of course that's long where the Russia probe began it says steel was quote verbally admonished by the FBI and that steel acknowledged the admonishment and even signed a document noting it now from this excerpt which obviously is tantalizing we don't have the wider context of why the other item comes from page two of these new documents it concerns the FBI's decision to terminate its relationship with steel guess when just days before the 2016 election now this document says steel had confirmed his relationship with the FBI to an outside party and that he was a source for a quote online article in addition to revealing his relationship with the FBI Steele also revealed information that he had provided to the bureau so take it together because this is pivotal stuff on November 1st one week before the election Steele informed by his FBI handler the nature of the relationship between the FBI and Steele would change completely and that was unlikely the FBI would continue a relationship with him that article was published online on October 31st it was written by someone who has broken a lot of news in this story who I'm sure you've seen if you watch Rachel you've seen him talk to Rachel it's david korn the mother jones Washington bureau chief he also interviewed Steele for this story and the headline is right there a veteran spy has given the FBI information alleging a Russian operation to cultivate Donald Trump that was before the election it was the first media account to reveal the existence of the memos that now of course have become a big deal they are known as the steel dossier they allege among other things that the Trump campaign had organized collusion with the Kremlin quote this is something of huge significance way above party politics that intelligence officer told corn that would be Steele quote I think Trump's own party should be aware of this stuff as well the official confirmation of the FBI investigation into the Trump campaigns contacts with Russia was not confirmed for many more months it's even easy to forget that because it's the kind of big information that's the center of American politics so we all talk about it people who don't even follow the news know about it but let's be clear it was not until March 2017 many months later that's after the inauguration after the election when FBI director James Comey went down to the hill where he was testifying and said yes there was an open Pro by that time the FBI had also initiated a separate but related investigation and that has now broken much into public view much more because the break came with this very curious indictment of a woman named Maria boo Tina as she was suspected as an unregistered agent of the Russian government that she was trying to mount this covert influence operation through a conservative group a gun rights group in the u.s. tonight the same reporter who had the breakthrough scoop about the Steele dossier has a new and obviously provocative question did alleged Russian spy maria boo tina caused a leadership shake-up at the NRA and the backstory here is an FBI dive prior to the fact of Trump becoming president into Russian attempts to influence the NRA which itself is a weird story now that counterintelligence investigation focused on a man who also has become more known one of these oleg arks his name Alexander tortion he's a Russian banker he was a politician there and he is a Putin Ally his protege is Maria boo Tina and she founded a gun rights group in Russia called the right to bear arms so you have a Putin connected oligarch attached to a gun rights platform and that is very odd Steven Holl the former chief of Russian operations for the CIA explains it thusly the idea of a private gun ownership is an Ethne to Putin so the question is why why was a pro gun campaign being hatched by a leader in Putin's own party the answer put forward here that Putin was reaching out to attract the NRA specifically over to Russia this is part of what the Justice Department alleges and again the case is only beginning but what they allege was a covert influence operation tortion cultivating ties with the NRA all the way back in 2010 he and Bettina become NRA members which is weird they begin intending and are a yearly conferences in the US which are about domestic politics they meet with top NRA officials they cultivate these friendships the pictures tell the story in fact two times they got senior NRA officials to go to Russia all expenses paid of course 2013 the president the NRA which if you follow politics you know is a big job and something of a conservative star among people who care a lot about gun rights which is a lot of people in America his name there you see him is David keen he goes to Moscow the NRA president introduced by guess who yes Maria Bettina and then they declared no two people were more alike than Russians and Americans so they had to work together thank you very much it's a great honor for me to be here as a partly because over the course of the last three years I hosted your Senator Alexander fortune that the National Rifle Association annual meetings in Washington NRA as five million members we worked with everyone both in the United States and of course here in Russia there are no people there are more alike than Americans in Russia there are no more peoples more alike than Americans and Russians I mean it's fine if you want to bring people together with commonality but that's not usually what you hear from highly conservative political operatives in America certainly not back then 2013 fast forward to December 2015 the middle of what is of course the pre presidential campaign season keen as well as other top NRA leaders include future and are a president Pete Brown well and they head back to Russia this is their second visit they go to Moscow boo Tina facilitating a meeting with the CEO of a private Russian gun manufacturer which produces a sniper rifle identified the pent by the Pentagon not for domestic use or hunting but actually as a threat to American soldiers the NRA leaders treated to a tour of that facility and a chance to of course shoot some guns on site the NRA reportedly spent 30 million dollars to support Trump in 2016 and on the one hand the do typically support Republican nominees but here's what you need to know that was triple the amount they spent on a on behalf of Mitt Romney just four years prior and then in January you get this report at McClatchy the FBI investigating whether Russia used this relationship with the NRA to illegally funnel foreign cash into the gun rights organization as part of an effort to support Trump so ever since Maria blue tina was arrested and charged with her conspiracy on behalf of russia the NRA has consistently declined to comment to all kinds of sources and all kinds of publications on this association with what is now an indicted Russian spy facing those allegations now journalist David corn is raising this question about whether the arrest of boo Tina caused a leadership shake-up shortly after at the NRA corn writing that on May 7th the NRA released a curious press release declaring Oliver North who HAP's his own history as a key player in the iran-contra scandal but is also a standing NRA board member was now quote poised to become the new president this changing of the guard and how it happened was odd he writes earlier that day Peter Brown oh then finishing his first term as NRA president had announced he would not seek a second annual term for 15 years the NRA leadership and followed a pretty specific pattern we're getting deep into the bylaws but it's actually quite important so here's how corn explains it an officer elected by the board to serve two consecutive annual terms as second vice-president then to his first vice president and finally to as president but the brown well the North transition broke this process in precedent puzzling many NRA Watchers it even puzzled the incoming president of the NRA himself Colonel North your reaction to being elected to present as president of the National Rifle Association well it's an unexpected privilege I am grateful for the unanimous support of the board I did not expect that this was going to be happening at this annual meeting but as soon as I get everything in order of my family because this was very sudden I'll be back to take that gavel those kind of on-camera interviews are useful may have sounded like a basic question but we learn from Oliver it's own mouth this was unexpected this was sudden he was getting ready to adjust at the last minute and then you have a true state secret that was unknown at least to the public at that time two weeks earlier in April FBI agents clad in their tactical gear were raiding boo Tina's apartment where they arrested her now we know that from these reports and korn asks did that FBI investigation of boo Tina lead to NRA president Peter Browns decision to in the words of Oliver North suddenly stepped down he had of course after all interacted with boo Tina in Moscow three years earlier and the NRA could easily shed light on this we would love to bring you their side of the story any comment anything vague anything but they are declining to comment tonight same for brown L corn reports he's not taking calls I'm joined now by the reporter at the center of the action David corn Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones David we always learn a lot from you I appreciate you joining me this Friday night thanks for having me on the weekend heading into the weekend you have a lot in this story as you know rachel has been on many pieces of this story for quite some time yeah what is advance through what happened with the NRA and let me start with the biggest question I don't need to save it reading between the lines of your reporting are you saying you have reason to believe there is another indictment coming pursuant to the NRA case I'm not saying that I don't know that and and I don't make any predictions on what the Moller investigation is going to be or the butene investigation which is separate we keep being surprised and and the big picture here are is that we keep learning new things things that we didn't know a week ago six months ago and so on all these investigations involving Michael Kohn Trump Russia and of course the NRA investigation but it was as you noted it was very puzzling when the NRA went through this leadership change I remember getting the press release and it was weirdly put Oliver North is poised to become NRA president not that he's been chosen and re president but he's poised to become NRA president as he as he put it it was news to me and no one could really explain why this very hierarchical organization that had very strict rules of secession in terms of its leadership would all of a sudden pluck a guy out who didn't see it coming and make him president the NRA when he wasn't prepared to be and then only recently with the Matina case did we learn about this FBI raid and remember her partner romantically and politically was a guy named Paul Erickson who was an NRA activist and he had been working with her to infiltrate penetrate make connections with people in the NRA and other conservative groups so if she were raided as she was one would expect him to know about it and were to start filtering out which could have caused a tremendous panic within the NRA and might have and might have led to anyone being connected with boo Tina to be scared I'm not sure about an indictment but to be scared of being caught up and the shortened soldier yes and Peter Brunell was very much involved having gone you know on trips that butene a organized and having been one of the nra highest officials that she had cultivated when you look at the nra which has a lot of seasoned political professionals people may disagree with their views on gun rights and access to guns but these are people who have been around washing and made to the top of one of the most powerful organizations around how can one benignly or positively explain the complete idiocy or ignorance that would be required to think that an authoritarian country would have a vibrant private gun rights movement you know m'c buzzing about this in the book I did with Michael Isikoff Russian Roulette remember we wrote about the Bettina case before it became a criminal case and we noted that she had shown up at NRA events and other conservative vents like CPAC the annual get-together and was really trying to make friends with some of the leading officials in fact one fellow you know who said yeah by his own admission he's in his 60s doesn't a lot of hair as a little bit of a punch he said I'm not used to a young attractive women coming up to me and saying will you be my facebook friend can i snapchat with you and he thought there was something odd and weird that booti 'no and this russian legislator named alexander torsion kept showing up and that the nra that he was a part of was embracing this pair of boris and natasha and so there were some people who thought this was odd but certainly if you watch that video of david keene if you watch the video that was made on the peter burnout trip in 2015 these guys are really having a good time they're getting off making these Russian connections and the human there was some suspicion about a snapchat honeypot yeah I think I mean I think what some people saw it that way but it's clear at the time and it was clear in the 2016 2016 campaign that whoever was masterminding this whether it was torsion or somebody else they had a pretty good insight into American politics if you want to work your way into you know influencing Republicans and conservatives who are now you know controlling all arms of government do it through the NRA right and what did what did Warren Zevon say bring lawyers guns and money yeah the the you know what has hit the fan one of my favorite songs family family show but I give them credit I think it was a I think it was out in the open you're getting at the fact that they were a quite adept at infiltrating specifically the conservative wing of American politics in the way they did it and that gives of course insight into what they're accused of with regard to the Trump campaign with JD Gordon a trump advisor who sits at the Nexus of guns and Trump it's so much fascinating stuff that the final question I have for you we have even gotten to yet which is the way you continue to figure into this and your report of the people have known for a long time your name and reporting came up in the very controversial debates over the wiretapping of Carter page and whether your material was underlying Lee was I would say underlying material for that lawful wiretap today we see in the little parts and I shared this with with viewers at the top the little parts that we do glean from what's come out with steel is the FBI assertion that they stopped working with him because of what he told you and what you published your response sir well I think we knew that already we certainly reported that in the book Michael Isikoff and myself so it's not a surprise it confirms that and you know the point I would make is that when I talked to Christopher steel in the very end of October 2016 he was talking to me very reluctantly he was scared the material that he had found connections allegations between the Trump of interactions between Trump and men and the Russian government frightened him as a veteran counterintelligence officer and he had taken his material to the FBI had been working with them but he felt this information needed to get out right some way before the election that the American public had to be told this so he was the I David had the FBI publicly confirmed that on the record before no not at all they were inside why we're doing everything you don't want everything they excuse me do you know why now well the the true reason is the conventional reason that it was a counterintelligence operation that was ongoing and Jim Comey and others have explained that they don't make that information public even when members of Congress ask now Steele's position was that he thought there was enough connections enough to worry about without knowing the full picture that the FBI should have worked harder he ought least the US government so in the US government to make more of that available to the public before they cast votes on November 8th so that's why he talked to me when he did that the FBI said okay you know too much of your own you know of a lone wolf doing this on your own and we don't want to work with you anymore so but I think he knew that this would get him in trouble with the bureau but he thought it was important the public knew something about this it's fascinating and it's a story that obviously has gotten deeper and you've been there from the start I do appreciate your time tonight sir well always good to be with you you know that thank you David hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep
