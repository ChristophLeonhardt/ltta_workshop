everything's going great holy cow you got the stock market going through the roof you got unemployment down low my gosh black Americans are employed at the greatest rate in recorded history so why is everybody miserable because leftists want you miserable and they're projecting this is take that with Curt Schlichter gosh you would think that liberals would be overjoyed at what's going on we've got working Americans wages going up there they're no longer stagnating you've got a record employment for black Americans you got record employment for Hispanic Americans people are back working again hard-working folks not just lawyers not just stockbrokers but people who make things who build things who feed this country who fuel this country even who fight for this country man or in our military got a two point nine percent pay raise times are good the economy is cookin I know personally because I'm a business owner yeah I'm a business owner and you know what I'm having to do something I haven't had to do in the 20 years since I opened this palatial law firm I'm having to compete for lawyers back in the day we used to be able to put out a sign that said lawyers want it and a whole bunch of little goose in suits with briefcases would show up begging for a job doing whatever I need him to do now now they're uppity they're picky they're saying well I don't know maybe you're not paying me enough maybe I'd like to go over there maybe you're going to have to compete to get the very best people working for you and that's great that's great because young people are finally having a chance to make their dreams come true to have a career you know when you come out of school and you've got this two hundred thousand dollars in student debt because you decide to do something foolish like take a Gender Studies major or go to law school and and now now people were in demand and now people are getting paid more now people can pay off that debt and move ahead with their lives you would think that liberals would think that was great but they don't they hate it they hated it burns and gnaws at them it annoys them because if you're able to survive on your own if you don't need the government's help then you don't need liberals you don't need them you are a proud citizen who can stand on his horrors or own feet I'm assuming you have feet I don't want to be oppressive towards people who don't have feet you can stand on your own feet and you don't need the Liberals to tell you what to do what to think how to feel how to live a good economy makes them irrelevant when they hate that idea they want to sabotage it they want to increase taxes they want to increase regulation they want to do everything they can to make you need them and they mostly hate it because Donald Trump's getting credit for it Donald Trump the avatar of normal Americans by the way my book militant normals drops one week from today go pre-order it do it now it'll explain everything but you you already know it you feel it instinctively when you see Nancy Pelosi up there going oh that $50 a month you get that's just a mere crumbs easy to say if you've got a hundred million dollars in your bank account all the other Democrats poopoo and the the the the job numbers poopoo and the fact that manufacturing workers are being employed again here in America and said overseas in China you understand what's going on finally we have a government an executive branch that's siding with the American people and liberals hate that because they don't side with the American people they side with themselves with their own narrow self-interest with their own power and we normal Americans we're sick of it this is the kind of exciting time that I got to live through in the 80s but if you are anywhere I don't know 40 or younger you've never lived through this you've never felt the excitement of being able to go out there and start your own business like I did and make your dreams come true like I like millions of other people did that's America that's what's great about America and liberals liberals hate America they love their own power the hell with them this is take that with Curt Schlichter if you want to see more of me you can follow me on twitter at kurt Schlichter it is spelled exactly as it sounds in the native stuttgart arees you can listen to me here on the rebel every Tuesday and Friday for my free outside the paywall rants you can read my town hall columns every Monday and Thursday at town hall calm and of course you need to go get my book militant normals it drops October 2nd you can pre-order it I promise you it's fantastic go get it thanks a lot I'll see you next time I'll take that with Kurt Schlichter you
