WE ARE PUTTING THE HARSHEST, STRONGEST, MOST STRINGENT SANCTIONS ON IRAN. I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THEM, A GOOD DEAL, A FAIR DEAL, A GOOD DEAL FOR THEM, BETTER FOR THEM. BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE MUST BE ABLE TO GO TO A SITE AND CHECK THAT SITE. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO THEIR MILITARY BASES TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE CHEATING. Sean: THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT EARLIER SAYING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MUST NEVER, EVER ALLOW IRAN TO HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HERE WITH REACTION, THE HOST OF THE RTV, HE'S THE HOST RIGHT HERE OF THE NUMBER ONE SHOW SUNDAY NIGHTS, 10:00 P.M. AND ALL OF CABLE. LIFE LIBERTY AND LEVIN. I CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE MARK LEVIN. I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON AND TALK ABOUT THE STORY. I FORCED YOU TO DO RADIO. LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THIS. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, AND I MADE YOU DO IT FOR ME. I MADE YOU WORK FOR FREE FOR A YEAR ON WEEKENDS. THAT'S ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY CAREER, MY FRIEND. HOW ARE YOU? NEVER BEEN DIFFERENT. Sean: MARK, WHEN I READ THE JUDGE ON FRIDAY, I THOUGHT OF YOU. YEARS AGO, HE WROTE AN INCREDIBLE BOOK CALLED "MEN IN BLACK." YOU WROTE THE LIBERTY AMERICAN TYRANNY. LIBERTY VERSUS TYRANNY. SO MANY OF THEM. STAY WHEN THEY ARE ALL GREAT BOOKS. YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. YOU'VE HEARD WHETHER THE JUDGE SAID FRIDAY. THEY ARE PUTTING THE SCREWS TO PAUL MANAFORT. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COLLUSION. THEY WANT HIM TO SING. BE CAREFUL. HE MAY NOT JUST SAYING. HE MAY COMPOSE. I WAS PROUD OF THAT JUDGE BECAUSE THAT JUDGE NAILED IT. NOW YOU SEE SARA CARTER'S REPORT TONIGHT. COMEY AND MUELLER COORDINATING. TELL ME WHY THIS IS SO BIG. LET'S HOPE THE JUDGE IS NOT JUST A GASBAG AND DOES SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS. LET'S DRAG US ALL BACK, FOR A FEW MINUTES, TO THE CONSTITUTION. BECAUSE THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE, THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO WIND UP. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE TO ANSWER SOME FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION. MR. MUELLER WANTS TO INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT COMMITTEE WANTS TO INTERVIEW HIM UNDER THE MOST ONEROUS CIRCUMSTANCE. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF AN INTERVIEW LIKE THAT BASED ON THOSE 49 GENERAL AREAS? 'S PURPOSE IS TO INDICT THE PRESIDENT. NOW, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF INDICTING THE PRESIDENT, TO TRY THE PRESIDENT FIND HIM GUILTY. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE CONVICTION? TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FROM OFFICE. THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN INDICTED WHILE IN OFFICE. NOT ONE. NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN FORCED BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND JURY, NOT ONE. NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER BEEN REMOVED FROM OFFICE BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN A TWO-THIRDS VOTE OF THE SENATE. NOT ONE. MUELLER'S PURPOSE, HIS PURPOSE IS TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT. THAT MEANS ONE MAN, THAT MEANS ONE MAN, ONE JURY WOULD USURP THE POWER, THE ENTIRE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF CONGRESS. THE POWER TO REMOVE A PRESIDENT. YOU CAN INDICT EVERY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL. A JUDGE, FOR INSTANCE, WHILE THEY ARE IN OFFICE, AND GO THROUGH THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS. YOU CANNOT DO IT WITH A PRESIDENT, AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU I'VE BEEN STARTING THIS FOR DECADES. I'M STARTING IT NOW. HERE'S THE AUTHORITATIVE BOOK. SO WHAT'S GOING ON NOW? TAKES TWO-THIRDS OF THE SENATE TO REMOVE A PRESIDENT. NOT ONE PROSECUTOR, NOT ONE JURY. SO MY QUESTION IS, FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, TO ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS COMMITS TIME TO STEP UP. TO THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, IT'S TIME TO PAY ATTENTION. TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, TO ALL THE LAWYERS YOU BRING ON YOUR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE NOW, THESE FIGHTS OVER WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE SUBPOENAED, THE PRESIDENT, WHETHER HE'S GOING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, WHETHER HE CAN BE INDICTED IN OFFICE, I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FRAMERS NEVER EVEN CONTEMPLATED WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY. THEY NEVER CONTEMPLATED THAT ONE PROSECUTOR, A CIVIL SERVANT, BUREAUCRAT APPOINTED BY SOMEBODY ELSE, WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO EFFECTIVELY REMOVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THE REASON WHY THE DEMOCRATS ARE HANGING THEIR HAT ON MUELLER, THE REASON WHY THE MEDIA ARE HANGING THEIR HAT ON MUELLER, THEY WILL NEVER GET TWO-THIRDS IN THE SENATE TO REMOVE THIS PRESIDENT. I DON'T CARE IF THEY IMPEACH HIM. THEY WILL NEVER GET TWO-THIRDS. IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. SO WHAT THEY ARE HOPING TO DO IS TRAP HIM IN THIS NOTION OF A SUBPOENA AND QUESTIONING, INDICT HIM, TRY TO HUMILIATE HIM. GO IN FRONT OF A COURT, HOPE THEY THINK GET THE SUPREME COURT ON THEIR SIDE BUT I DOUBT THEY WILL BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. THAT'S OUR GAME PLAN. GET HIM TO RESIGN. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, AS I SPEAK, MR. MUELLER IS UNDERMINING THE CONSTITUTION. HE'S NOT UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. WHETHER HE IS CONSULTING WITH COMEY OR CONSULTING WITH NOSTRADAMUS, MY POINT IS THIS. WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW LEE'S ANTI-CONSTITUTIONAL. IT'S UNDERMINING OUR SYSTEM. THE FRAMERS WANTED THE BODY POLITIC TO DECIDE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO REMOVE ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. JUST AS THE BODY POLITIC PUT THAT PERSON THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE MEDIA ARE TOO IGNORANT, TOO LIBERAL, TOO OBSESSED TO UNDERSTAND THIS, BUT I AM HOPING TONIGHT WITH A FEW MINUTES HERE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WELL. Sean: YOU KNOW, I CALL YOU THE GREAT ONE. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS, OUR GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT IN MY LIFE WAS CONVINCING YOU TO FILL IN FOR MY RADIO SHOW, AND IT DID TAKE CONVINCING. WASN'T EASY. MARK, YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF OUR FRAMERS AND OUR FOUNDERS IN OUR CONSTITUTION IS SECOND NOBODY. THESE WORDS TONIGHT ARE IMPORTANT. I AGREE WITH EVERYONE OF THEM. WE LOVE HAVING YOU ON. DON'T FORGET EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT,
