It’s obvious from just
looking at these women,
how much work goes
into that job.
Even just to audition for
these teams is really costly.
I’m Amanda Hess and
I’m a critic at large
for the culture department
of The New York Times.
I’ve also been reporting on
cheerleaders since 2011.
Back in 2011, I wrote what
I think is the first story
about the underpayment
and treatment
of N.F.L. cheerleaders.
But at the time I
wrote that, I actually
went on cable news
and the person
interviewing me said that he
found my story interesting,
but he thought I was the only
person who cared about it.
So a lot has changed since then.
So the difference between
what was happening in 2014
and what’s happening
now is that initially
some cheerleaders in
a variety of teams
started suing for minimum wage.
They weren’t being
paid the minimum wage
when you factored in
everything from the practices
they were obligated to go to,
the games, calendar shoots.
Now the lawsuit
that has been filed
is a gender
discrimination lawsuit.
They are basically controlled
by the teams in ways
that male players are not.
The teams were exerting
this huge amount
of control over their lives.
The Buffalo Jills were told
everything from how to fold
a napkin to how to
wash their genitals.
Cheerleaders are, as a
rule, highly discouraged
from fraternizing
with players.
That can mean anything
from, you know,
talking to them at bars
to dating them.
Part of the problem with the
rules against cheerleaders
fraternizing not
just with players
but with other members
of the teams’ organizations
is that it makes it
difficult for them
to advocate for themselves,
to get a different job
with a company, you know,
later on
to use that position to get
something that’s actually paid.
