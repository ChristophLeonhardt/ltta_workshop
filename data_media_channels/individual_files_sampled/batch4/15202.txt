Robert Muller's witch-hunt expands and it's becoming increasingly evident that we have a dysfunctional Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Muller made a referral to the Department of Justice to rod Rosen Steve I don't think Rob Rosenstein is an honest actor I don't think Rob Rosenstein has the best interests of this president at heart I think rod Rosenstein is part of the deep stay and what came next is so shocking that even Alan Dershowitz liberal law Professor Alan Dershowitz a guy universally regarded by Republicans Democrats conservative liberals as one of the best lawyers in history arguably the best criminal lawyer existing today operating today Alan Dershowitz is even horrified by this he went as far as to call Robert Muller a partisan and a zealot what they did was raided not just the office of president Trump's outside attorney Michael Cohen his personal attorney Michael Cohen but his home and another rented space Michael Cohen has been cooperating I'm gonna tell you as a law enforcement guy I've never seen anything this bad this is beyond unprecedented because what they did was seize lawyer-client protected information lawyer-client privilege communications this is beyond improper this went from robert muller now this is all about stormy Daniels this porn star that Michael Cohen allegedly paid one hundred and thirty thousand dollars people say well the fact that he paid her is proof that he and Donald Trump did something wrong no it's not proof of anything people often settle lawsuits back when I was in business before I was in media I sued my company was sued were a data company and we raised money and an investment group they were very unsuccessful investment group couldn't they couldn't raise money for us in our company became successful and they sued us they claimed that even though our company had been successful without them they were still entitled to a small portion of equity in the company we disagreed when we did a cost-benefit analysis we realized that the lawsuit would have cost us X and it was far cheaper to settle for Y and they would take Y and so to not have to endure the cost of a lawsuit and the time of a lawsuit and depositions and interrogatories and showing up at hearings because in addition to the money we would have spent on legal fees which is double and a half what they accept that in the settlement when we factored in all of our time and stress and energy settling was about four times cheaper even though we did nothing wrong we felt they were entitled to nothing it was just cheaper to settle the case we might have won in the end we might have been able to collect all those legal fees back but guess what they had no money they had no money so it would have been a Pyrrhic victory that's much how I see the settlement with stormy Daniels sometimes it's just cheaper to settle a hundred and thirty thousand dollars isn't a lot of money to guys like Donald Trump the guys like Michael Cohen Boeing makes millions of dollars a year as a lawyer for somebody like Trump and other high-profile clients so to spend a hundred and thirty thousand bucks to make a problem go away that's not even really a problem more of a PR problem well it's pennies on the dollar in the grand scheme especially when someone is as high-profile as Trump it happens every single day but if you listen to Mulder and you listen to Rosenstein and you listen to the Liberals and MSNBC and CNN it's and all of the other very Washington Post and New York Times they'll make it seem like this is on precedented it never happens it happens every day but that's not even the issue the issue is robert muller knowing it happens every day referring the case to rod Rosenstein who then referred the case to the US attorney from the Southern District of New York who went to a judge who got warrants and again like they did the Paul Manafort sent FBI agents to conduct raids Cohen again was cooperating he was turning over documents and it appears that Muller and Rosenstein well that wasn't good enough for them they wanted the sacred privileged communications and that's what has Alan Dershowitz so up in arms now Dershowitz notes a lot of other things about Robert Muller that I'm gonna be getting into later today on my longer show off the cuff Declassified but one thing I want to say here before we go is that Robert Muller has now stepped over the line I believe Alan Dershowitz is right I believe Robert Muller is a zealot and a partisan I'm gonna tell you about a lot of other things he's done very very disturbing and improper things that Robert Muller has done in his career beyond what he did during the anthrax investigation in 2001 when he identified the wrong guy Robert Muller to me is a very unethical actor somebody who operates with impunity somebody who does whatever he wants to do and the facts be damned the founding fathers never intended us to have an unmanageable operating without oversight unrestricted unlimited budget with a crew of investigators special counsel who was not confirmed by the Senate appears you'll report an answer to no one he says Rosenstein but I don't believe that and I'm gonna giving you much more about that later on as well that is not what the founding fathers intended for that special counsel who operates without oversight unrestricted massive budget crew of investigators kicks in doors all seemingly as a do-over because the wrong person won the election so much more to discuss with the impropriety of robert muller especially these moronic Inspira see theories on the alt-right that Muller is somehow an ally of the President and this is all for DHS on the part of Jeff Sessions that's moronic I'm gonna explain why when my law enforcement lens I just plant explain a lot more to you about this case through my law enforcement lens today on my longer show off-the-cuff Declassified right here on the rebel these new moves by Muller are very disturbing and I want to keep bringing you the updates every single day so help me keep doing that by subscribing to our premium service at www.affordablecomm.com
