161
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:49,669
used to be someone who stayed away from

162
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,229
internet memes but then I took an arrow

recently died another post death

inspiration to me spent Christmas with

174
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,460
my close relative who stayed positive

175
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,310
and strong I'm so<font color="#CCCCCC"> glad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he made it I feel</font>

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,889
ability to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a critical thing</font>

180
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,870
and as a result every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day I research</font>

181
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,550
I've realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ignorance is bliss</font>

182
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,939
but now I know what I know it can't be

183
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,279
unlearned and I'm never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,960
whether stranger friend or family I'd

186
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,229
begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain with care the real</font>

187
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,120
issues we face in this world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

188
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,069
the potential solutions are and the

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,779
response has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been truly inspiring I've</font>

190
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,919
experienced a lot of death this year

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,229
with many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people having their lives cut</font>

192
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,300
short due to illness or societies

193
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,370
negligence although people like Steve

194
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,229
Jobs and Christopher Hitchens did leave

195
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,469
legacies behind their lives were taken

196
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,639
away when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were still making</font>

197
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,500
progress and the same could be said for

198
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">those that took to the streets fighting</font>

199
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,129
for their freedom they lost their lives

200
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:14,319
and we're still here today and this has

201
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,330
made me reflect on my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> mortality I</font>

202
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,490
need to stop making<font color="#CCCCCC"> excuses myself I</font>

203
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,379
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start taking care of my body I</font>

204
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,599
need to start eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and taking</font>

205
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,460
regular exercise because the truth is

206
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,409
you only get one body in life and if you

207
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:29,110
fuck it up there is no replacement my

208
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,060
mind is now stronger with knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

209
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,310
experience but it requires a decent

210
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,800
physical well-being<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support it and so</font>

211
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,629
I now live every day as if it's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

212
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,879
and i don't mean with desperation but

213
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,860
with efficiency and in any year<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

214
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> preparing myself for the</font>

215
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,969
future for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long run 2011 was a year</font>

216
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:48,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sacrifice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me i threw aside all</font>

217
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,899
the trivia aspects of my life and began

218
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:52,419
focusing what really matters the bigger

219
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,849
picture but because of this a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

220
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know have now turned their</font>

221
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,759
back on me and so if you're watching

222
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,149
this right now thank you just thank you

223
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,009
thank you thank you from the bottom of

224
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,000
my heart I'll see in 2012 at least until

225
00:08:07,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font>
