1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,200
BACK IN 2016 DURING THE
DEBATES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,130
HILLARY CLINTON A MAN STOOD UP
AND ASKED THE QUESTION.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,280
HIS NAME WAS KEN BONE AND HE WAS
CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THE POLICIES

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,870
WERE IN REGARD TO THE
COAL INDUSTRY.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,360
HE AT THE TIME WAS A COAL POWER
PLANT OPERATOR, HIS JOB WAS

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,410
ON THE LINE AND HE WAS
CONCERNED.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,410
HE BECAME A MEME INSTANTLY
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT HE

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,210
LOOKED THE WAY HE DOES.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,130
THE RED SWEATER, THE
MUSTACHE, THE GLASSES.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,829
HE WAS UNDECIDED IN REGARD TO
WHO HE WOULD VOTE FOR AT

11
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,559
THE TIME.

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,649
HE IS BACK IN THE NEWS TODAY
BECAUSE OF A SIMPLE TWEET HE PUT

13
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,260
OUT DURING THE STATE
OF THE UNION.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,550
IT WAS DURING TRUMP'S STATEMENTS
ABOUT THE COAL INDUSTRY.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,980
TAKE A LOOK.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,909
>> WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON
AMERICAN ENERGY AND WE HAVE

17
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,749
ENDED THE WAR ON BEAUTIFUL,
CLEAN COAL.

18
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:11,390
>>SO WHAT DOES KEN BONE THINK AS
SOMEONE WHO WAS EMPLOYED BY THE

19
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,470
COAL INDUSTRY?

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,830
HAVE WE ENDED
THIS WAR ON BEAUTIFUL CLEAN

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,830
COAL?

22
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:38,080
>> HERE IS 
MORE BACKGROUND.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,820
PEOPLE DUG INTO HIS BACKGROUND.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,530
HE IS A PRIVATE CITIZEN.

25
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:52,800
IF YOU DIG INTO ANYONE'S
BACKGROUND, YOU WILL FIND

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,430
SOMETHING DAMAGING ABOUT THEM.

27
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,650
YOU CAN DO IT TOO LITERALLY
ALMOST ANYONE.

28
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,520
BUT BONE DID NOT ASK TO BE
A PUBLIC FIGURE.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,620
THEY DUG IN AND FOUND
DAMAGING STUFF.

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,639
APPARENTLY SOME STUFF ABOUT
EROTIC PHOTOS, I DON'T REMEMBER.

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,390
I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER.

32
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,230
THEN THEY FOUND THAT HE HAD SAID
TRAYVON MARTIN'S KILLING

33
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,420
WAS JUSTIFIED.

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,760
IT MAKES MY HAIR STAND ON EDGE.

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:43,230
I WANT TO HATE KEN BONE.

36
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,510
I DON'T WANT THE COUNTRY,
PRIVATE CITIZENS RIPPING EACH

37
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,560
OTHER APART.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,420
I KNOW IT IS CLICH…

39
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,129
BUT YOU ARE GOING TO AGREE ON

40
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:58,269
MOST STUFF AND IT IS THE
POLITICIANS THAT DO THE

41
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,090
PROPAGANDA THAT SPLIT US.

42
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,700
MY FAVORITE ISSUE, THE ONE THAT
IS MOST IMPORTANT, MONEY IN

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,550
POLITICS.

44
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:18,450
BUT KEN BONE TO ME ñ I
SAY THAT AS CONTEXT FOR I AM NOT

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,980
A KEN BONE FAN.

46
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,879
BUT HE IS IN A SENSE THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN, AND THAT IS WHAT

47
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,260
HE RESONATED AT THE
TIME THAT HE DID.

48
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,480
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WHO DOESN'T
KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT POLITICS.

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,629
IN REALITY THERE IS A GIANT
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM, AND

50
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:42,610
THEY ARE BOTH IN THEIR
OWN WAY LOANSOME.

51
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,040
HE OBVIOUSLY

52
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,359
HAD SOME CONSERVATIVE LEANINGS

53
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:57,090
BASED ON THE TRAYVON
MARTIN THING.

54
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,090
YOU CAN'T JUST

55
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,349
CARICATURE PEOPLE BASED ON ONE
THING THEY HAVE SAID EVEN AS

56
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,139
DEEPLY TROUBLING AS THAT COMMENT

57
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,390
ABOUT TRAYVON MARTIN IS.

58
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,269
NOW HE
WAS LOOKING AT WHAT TRUMP HAS

59
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:17,639
DONE AND SAYS THAT IS NOT AT ALL
WHAT YOU PROMISED, OR WHAT YOU

60
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,400
ARE SAYING TODAY.

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:32,320
THERE IN LIES THE STORY OF
DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL CAREER.

62
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,930
MORE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY
REALIZE THIS IS NOT WHAT HE

63
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,930
PROMISES.

64
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,949
THIS GUY IS NOT WHAT
HE CLAIMED TO BE.

65
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,889
>> DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION
THERE WAS A LENGTHY PORTION

66
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,780
WHERE TRUMP APPLAUDED HIMSELF
FOR PASSING THESE TAX CUTS

67
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,470
FOR THE WEALTHY.

68
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,980
I THOUGHT IT WAS A POOR
POLITICAL STRATEGY TO EMPHASIZE

69
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,919
THAT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH

70
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,350
A DEEPLY UNPOPULAR BILL.

71
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,830
AND ALSO AMERICANS ARE GOING TO
NOTICE THAT THEIR WAGES ARE

72
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,830
STAGNANT.

73
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,349
THEY WILL NOTICE THAT THEIR TAX
CUTS WILL EXPIRE WHILE THE

74
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:19,090
TAX CUTS FOR CORPORATIONS OF THE
TOP 1% WILL BE PERMANENT.

75
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,129
THE LONGER HE IS IN OFFICE, THE
MORE HIS POLICIES REALLY SET IN

76
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,120
AND GIVE AMERICANS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE HOW

77
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,304
DESTRUCTIVE AND DAMAGING THEY
ARE, THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME

78
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:32,180
PORTION OF HIS VOTERS THAT WILL

79
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,500
FLIP.

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,080
BUT THEN THERE IS
THAT CORE BASE.

81
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,470
ESPECIALLY THE RELIGIOUS VOTERS
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN

82
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,580
PREVIOUS SHOWS THAT GENUINELY
THINK TRUMP WAS PUT IN

83
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,620
OFFICE BY GOD HIMSELF.

84
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,840
THOSE PEOPLE WILL NEVER FLIP.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
IT
DOESN'T MATTER IF THEIR WAGES

86
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,740
ARE STAGNANT, OR HAVING TROUBLE
PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE, IF

87
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,040
THEY LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE, IF

88
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,349
THEY LOSE THE GOVERNMENT AID
THEY GET BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE

89
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:03,569
ENOUGH MONEY WORKING FULL-TIME
AT A COMPANY LIKE WALMART.

90
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:13,380
IT DOES NOT MATTER, AND THAT IS
THE MOST DEVASTATING PART OF IT.

91
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,660
>> THE ONES BETWEEN THE 40%

92
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,900
THAT DONALD TRUMP PEAKS AT, IN
THE LATEST POLL HE IS AT 42.

93
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:28,409
AN ELECTION DAY THERE WAS A
PULLED THAT HAD HIM ON 37.

94
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:36,220
25% WHICH IS HIS MINIMUM,
THAT GOT HIM INTO OFFICE.

95
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,610
THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT, KEN
BONE IS IN THAT MIDDLE AREA

96
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,940
BETWEEN 25% AND 40%.

97
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,400
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
TRUMP STAYING IN OFFICE AND

98
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,740
NOT STAYING IN OFFICE.

99
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,830
WHETHER IT IS THROUGH
IMPEACHMENT OR THE 25TH

100
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,039
AMENDMENT.

101
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,009
LOSING THE CAN BONES OF THE
WORLD DOES MAKE A

102
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,849
DIFFERENCE, IT MAKES A
GIANT DIFFERENCE.

103
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,770
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
40 AND 25 IS 40

104
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,699
IS BARELY HANGING IN THERE.

105
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,530
25 IS DEVASTATING.

106
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,319
THE CLOSER HE GETS TO 25,

107
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,229
THE CLOSER HE GETS TO
LEAVING OFFICE.

108
00:07:08,229 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT IS WHY STORIES LIKE
THIS ARE IMPORTANT.
