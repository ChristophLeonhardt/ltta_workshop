What makes a 
carnivore smart?
For puzzle solving,
tooth and claw are just
not that important.
Relative brain size
is the key.
That’s how big the brain
is in relation to the body.
Researchers at the
University of Wyoming
used metal puzzle boxes
to test 140 animals and
39 different species from
nine different families —
all carnivores.
They recorded animals
in zoos trying to get
those boxes open to get 
at their favorite treat inside.
Bears did the best.
The family that includes
raccoons and coatimundis
came in second —
no real surprise there.
What was a surprise
was the poor performance
of animals that live
in complex social groups,
sometimes thought to
promote intelligence.
Sadly, if you’re a fan
of ‘Meerkat Manor,’
the family that includes 
meerkats and
mongooses did the worst.
Of course, when a poor
performer like a big cat
does well, 
that’s reason to cheer.
Go tigers!
