yep you read that right angler Merkel has said that the UK must suffer during the brexit negotiations we all knew her feelings but now she's just flat-out said it Angela Merkel has said that the negotiation process must mean that the UK suffers a little bit nice one angora during a BBC Newsnight interview the BBC's political editor Nick what revealed that angler Merkel has been heard in private to say that the UK must simply suffer a little bit during the brexit negotiations and that the bottom line is that they want a deal but not a deal at any price so in other words the European Union doesn't want to make any sacrifices they don't want to negotiate the deal they just want to dictate the terms nice one there's a surprise eh but what also explains that the EU takes a particular issue with the common rule book and the customs partnership as so do I an attempt by May to negotiate a convenient system whereby products travel across the UK EU border more easily but they're not interested they're not interested they don't want to make any sacrifices on that one they say that it's splitting up their four freedoms which is fine by me I mean I'd rather not have these renamed EU processes that Teresa may calls brexit they're not but doesn't this prove by the way all along that they're only interested in hurting and punishing the UK they just want to make a mockery out of us make an example out of us for daring to vote against them they're setting an example and the evidence is clear it's right there for us to see but the Liberal Democrats Gina Miller the Labour Party the far left and so many of May's remain Tories and much of the political establishment just refused to see it it's like political masochism what are the politicians getting out of this if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to like and subscribe you
