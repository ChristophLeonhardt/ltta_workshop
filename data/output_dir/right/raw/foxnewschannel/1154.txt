1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:03,145
AND I WISH I DID.

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,149
THE PRESIDENT ALSO NOTED, NO

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:08,551
CHANGES ON THE HORIZON.

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,618
>> INTERESTING TALE.

5
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:13,155
MY NEXT GUEST IS PART OF THE

6
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:13,956
PRESIDENT'S INNER CIRCLE.

7
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:16,659
BRAD PARR SCALE WAS CITED AS ONE

8
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,360
OF THE MASTERMINDS BEHIND

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,595
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VICTORY SENT

10
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:21,363
SERVING AS THE CAMPAIGN'S

11
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:22,765
DIGITAL DIRECTOR.

12
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:25,568
NOW HE'S TAKEN THE HELM AND

13
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,403
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WILL GET TO

14
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:30,639
IN JUST A MOMENT.

15
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:33,742
THANKS FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.

16
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,044
HOW DIFFICULT DOES THAT STUFF

17
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:36,345
MAKE YOUR JOB?

18
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:38,314
IN TERMS OF THE TWEETS AND THE

19
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:39,982
JEFF SESSIONS ISSUE?

20
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:42,184
>> I DON'T THINK I MAKE MY JOB

21
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,385
ANY MORE DIFFICULT.

22
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,120
I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,356
DEATH.MICHAEL JEFF SESSIONS, I

24
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:48,557
WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE

25
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:50,092
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR

26
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:50,125
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR0

27
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:50,159
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR5

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:50,960
CAMPAIGNING THERE SINCE FEBRUAR.

29
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,761
IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR MYSELF

30
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,095
AS WELL.

31
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,697
KNOWS AS MUCH AS I DO THAT THERE

32
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:56,966
WAS NO COLLUSION AND HE WAS

33
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,267
THERE, HE WAS AROUND.

34
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,035
IT WASN'T LIKE HE WAS IN THERE

35
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,171
MAKING LARGE DECISIONS BUT HE

36
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,172
WAS WATCHING.

37
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:04,772
IT IS A DISAPPOINTMENT, AND I'M

38
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:05,507
100% THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

39
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:07,643
WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS

40
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:09,178
GOING TO RECUSE HIMSELF, HE

41
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:10,779
WOULD HAVE CHOSEN SOMEONE ELSE.

42
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,481
SOME OF THAT NATURE WE COULD

43
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,049
MOVE ON FROM THIS.

44
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,584
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK HE

45
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:16,018
SHOULD RESIGN?

46
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:17,586
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT, WE NEED

47
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:19,221
TO FINISH THE JOB AT HAND IT

48
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:19,488
NOW.

49
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:21,023
I THINK WHEN THE FINAL REPORTS

50
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:22,992
COME OUT AND THEY SAY THERE IS

51
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:26,128
NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA, THE

52
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:26,829
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

53
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,331
IS LEGITIMATE AND WE FINALLY

54
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:31,533
COME TO THESE CONCLUSIONS, THE

55
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,301
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE ANY

56
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,537
CONCLUSION HE WANTS TO.

57
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,739
>> Martha: IT'S INTERESTING

58
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:37,473
TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU RAN

59
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,942
THE WHOLE DIGITAL PART OF THE

60
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:40,743
CAMPAIGN, ADVERTISING THESE

61
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:41,844
REMOTE PLACES WHERE YOU HADN'T

62
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:42,544
SEEN VOTERS TURN OUT THE WAY

63
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,780
THEY DID BEFORE THE TRUMP

64
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,748
CAMPAIGN.

65
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:46,782
SO I KNOW IT'S ESPECIALLY

66
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,384
FRUSTRATING FOR YOU TO HEAR THAT

67
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,386
THE RUSSIANS SORT OF SOMEHOW

68
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:54,456
MANAGED TO THROW THE CAMPAIGN TO

69
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:55,357
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

70
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,559
IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WERE

71
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,961
DOING, DIDN'T YOU INTERSECT AT

72
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,362
SOME POINT, IF THEY WERE PUTTING

73
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:03,632
ALL THESE ADS OUT ON TWITTER AND

74
00:02:03,632 --> 00:02:04,967
FACEBOOK, AND YOU ARE DOING THE

75
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:05,367
SAME THING?

76
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:06,835
>> IT'S LIKE SEEING A LIGHT RAIN

77
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,637
STORM IN ONE PART OF THE CITY

78
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:10,205
FLOODED THE OTHER PARTS OF THE

79
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:10,506
CITY.

80
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,707
IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN.

81
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,776
BUT THEY DID WAS A COUPLE OF

82
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,910
RAINDROPS INSIDE OF A WATERFALL

83
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,111
OF THINGS THAT WERE OCCURRING

84
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,948
FROM LEGITIMATE SOURCES AND PAID

85
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:19,748
CAMPAIGNS.

86
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:21,550
I CONTINUE TO SEE THIS AS A

87
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,351
POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.

88
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,354
THE PRESIDENT IS 100% RIGHT WITH

89
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,155
ALL THAT.

90
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:26,889
REGARDLESS OF WHAT SOME PEOPLE

91
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:29,758
MAY HAVE DONE TEN YEARS AGO, IT

92
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:30,759
DOESN'T MATTER.

93
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,062
THE CAMPAIGN WAS RUN EVERY DAY

94
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:34,096
AS A LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN.

95
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:36,565
>> Martha: I THOUGHT IT WAS

96
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:37,366
INTERESTING, BEN ROACH JUST

97
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,200
WROTE A BOOK.

98
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,569
IN THE BOOK, HE SAID THAT

99
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,603
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID TO HIM,

100
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:44,006
THAT WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO GO TO

101
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:47,509
MICHIGAN TO CAMPAIGN IN OCTOBER,

102
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:49,244
THAT HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.

103
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:50,212
>> YEAH.

104
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,214
WELL I THINK THE FINAL ANSWER

105
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,016
WAS WHEN SHE CANCELED HER

106
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:55,217
FIREWORK DISPLAY.

107
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:55,951
THEY ALL STARTED SCRAMBLING AT

108
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,653
THE END.

109
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:58,821
WE JUST HAD BETTER DATA.

110
00:02:58,821 --> 00:02:59,855
THEY HAD RUN AN OPERATION THAT

111
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:01,824
WAS SOPHISTICATED FOR THAT TIME.

112
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,225
OF WHAT WE KNOW NOW.

113
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,626
THE KIND OF THINGS THE

114
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:05,627
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE

115
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:08,564
CAN TELL US NOW, WE CAN SEE THE

116
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,198
FUTURE OF HOW THESE VOTING

117
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:09,932
SCORES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND

118
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:11,867
WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SMART

119
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,503
DECISIONS, SO WE DID THAT.

120
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:16,538
>> Martha: THERE ARE SOME

121
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:17,172
AREAS THAT PEOPLE SAY ARE

122
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:18,574
POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES FOR

123
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,575
THE PRESIDENT.

124
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,776
SUBURBAN VOTERS, SUBURBAN WOMEN

125
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,145
OUTSIDE OF THE NATION'S BIG

126
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:24,446
CITIES WHO ENDED UP VOTING FOR

127
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,180
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND WHETHER OR

128
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,550
NOT THEY DO THIS THIS TIME

129
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,884
AROUND.

130
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:29,485
BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS, THE

131
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:30,285
FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF

132
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:31,987
AMERICA THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

133
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:32,554
TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT.

134
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:34,556
YOU SAY THE DATA SO FAR LOOKS

135
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,958
REALLY GOOD.

136
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,859
WHAT ABOUT THOSE GROUPS?

137
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,461
HOW DO YOU GET THEM TO TURN OUT?

138
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,064
>> THE FIRST IS, THE DATA HAS

139
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:44,533
NEVER LOOKED BETTER FOR THE

140
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,534
PRESIDENT.

141
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:47,536
WE HAVE RUN THE LARGEST DATE

142
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:48,404
OPERATION SURVEY WORK IN THE

143
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:50,172
COUNTRY AND WE SEE THAT AMERICA

144
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:51,240
IS STARTING TO SEE THAT THEIR

145
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,841
PERSONAL ECONOMIES ARE GETTING

146
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,643
BETTER, NATIONAL SECURITY IS

147
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,110
GETTING BETTER.

148
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,312
AND I THINK THEY ARE STARTING TO

149
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,047
SEE IF HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

150
00:03:58,047 --> 00:03:59,381
AS MUCH AS THE MEDIA DOESN'T

151
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,983
WANT OUTSIDE OF A COUPLE OF

152
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,184
STATIONS AND A COUPLE PEOPLE,

153
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:03,318
HOW MUCH THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK

154
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:05,421
ABOUT ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THEY ARE

155
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:08,323
STARTING TO GET THROUGH.

156
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:13,529
ONE OF THOSE THINGS I'M

157
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:16,165
INTRODUCING IS, A FEW

158
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:19,334
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, ALMOST 24-36

159
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,371
HOURS, AND IN 500 DAYS THEY HAVE

160
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:23,405
ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH.

161
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:29,344
HE HAS TURBOCHARGE THE ECONOMY,

162
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:32,448
AND THE REGULATIONS WERE KILLING

163
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:34,349
JOBS.

164
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:35,584
AND PEOPLE CAN GO THROUGH AND

165
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,952
SEE, THE MEDIA DOESN'T TALK

166
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:37,753
ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

167
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:39,555
I THINK WHEN SUBURBAN PEOPLE SEE

168
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:42,157
THAT, AND THEY SEE THIS PERSONAL

169
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,826
ECONOMY AND IMPROVEMENT, THEY

170
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,794
CAN BUT THEIR KID IN A BALLERINA

171
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:48,363
CLASS, THEY CAN BUY A NEW CAR,

172
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:49,565
THEY CAN DO THESE THINGS.

173
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,867
>> AND I THINK PEOPLE DO CARE

174
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:52,534
FIRST AND FOREMOST ABOUT HOW

175
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,503
THEY ARE DOING AND NOT SO MUCH

176
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,405
ABOUT THESE ISSUES THAT WE CARE.

177
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:57,806
BUT BACK TO THE MESSAGE, DOES IT

178
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:59,641
FRUSTRATE YOU AS A PERSON WHO IS

179
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,777
IN CHARGE OF THE MESSAGE GOING

180
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:02,778
FORWARD, BUT WHEN IT GETS MOCKED

181
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:06,115
UP WITH ALL THE STUFF ABOUT JEFF

182
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:06,482
SESSIONS?

183
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,350
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN

184
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,051
THESE SUBURBAN AREAS WHO ARE

185
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,052
WATCHING ALL THAT AND KIND OF

186
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:12,488
WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THE

187
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,823
WHEELS ARE COMING OFF.

188
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:20,162
>> IS REAL BEFORE THIS I WAS A

189
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,163
VERY POLITICAL.

190
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,965

IS SOMEHOW TRYING TO DICTATE

217
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,381
WHAT THE REST OF AMERICA CAN

218
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:15,150
CONSUME AND WHO CAN BE THE

219
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,484
VOICE.

220
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:17,619
IT WORRIES ME THAT POSSIBLY

221
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:19,688
THREE OR FOUR EXECUTIVES HAVE

222
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:20,322
ENOUGH CONTROL TO CONTROL

223
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,823
EXACTLY WHAT YOU READ IT, WHAT

225
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,761
AND I THINK THAT CAN HAVE A

233
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,109
