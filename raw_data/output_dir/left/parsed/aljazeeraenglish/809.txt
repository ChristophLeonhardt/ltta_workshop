I think about 75 to 80% cancellations
have happened during that period and
everyone all the tutors who have been
staying and having holiday in these
affected areas have gone back
we were thinking about moving maybe to
Goa but at the end way we thought that
it was okay to move here
my mum took out some place today from
one of our clothes and we're gonna go
give it to send me proof he been
affected by sponsor I think that's why
I'm half duty because we're helping at
the same time as like having a holiday
our whole industry is badly affected
devastated I'm confident that we'll get
our former glory back but it's going to
take a lot of work
