the German army is recruiting an increasing number of miners according to figures from the country's defense ministry in fact over two thousand teenagers are now volunteering for Germany's Armed Forces that's three times more than six years ago Germany is one of the few countries worldwide that allows under-18s to volunteer they're only in a non-combat role teenagers can apply if they are seventeen and have parental consent the German military is currently conducting a recruitment drive sending officers to give talks in schools nationwide campaign also features an online reality show the program follows army recruits for 12 weeks and is one of Germany's most popular online projects however its role in making the military more attractive to young people has drawn criticisms the United Nations is concerned that the recruitment drive specifically targets children the German army has defended his methods insisting that the training is done under strict supervision earlier we spoke to a regional MP from Germany's Left Party Martin Dulce he's against the idea of focusing on under 18s for army recruitment there had been a huge campaigns in schools even in kindergarten to make the army more attractive to young people there had been some schools who had been working together with the army to put the young students in some kind of camp we support some initiatives called peidong Kuna Bundeswehr for example which say as well that education should take place without bonus where the people who are underaged they shouldn't be urged to get into the army the United Nation already in 2014 asked the German government to stop this and raise the ADH of soldiers I think this is a problem but the main problem is if you do a foreign policy with this which is based on dialogue you don't need such a strong army also many soldiers I think that is the main problem
