8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,099
high quality level of discussion I was

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,250
absolutely blown away by it so thank you

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,289
moving on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main part of this video</font>

11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,699
now that it's mutiny just summer which

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,960
you can tell because I'm shooting<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,490
videos in the morning when the sunshine

14
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,080
is out and bright and I've already been

15
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,150
awake for hours it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

16
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,490
watching like have having fewer like

17
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,650
intense TV marathons basically

18
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,239
throughout the whole of winter<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

19
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,760
watch west wing or just cycle repeat

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,320
over and over again and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,149
watch I like loads of other shows as

22
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,670
well but partly not having a TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I'm</font>

23
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,170
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to sit in front of it and</font>

24
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,450
just like flick I mean that really helps

25
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,789
and it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you miss a lot the</font>

26
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,289
adverts as well which is really nice

27
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,940
like I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life is so much</font>

28
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,110
better than or having all these adverts

29
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,879
everywhere but it also does mean I'm

30
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,760
discovering less a new television in the

31
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,980
way that I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and maybe missing</font>

32
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">out on some kind of like cultural</font>

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,730
communal experiences but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

34
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,438
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I count as massive loss</font>

35
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,270
especially because there's so many good

36
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,400
books to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read there's only like other</font>

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to do so I just count I trust my</font>

38
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,850
friends to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what something's good</font>

39
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,500
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watch it in that vein there</font>

40
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,970
will be no spoiler tip but I mean that

41
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,310
very broad<font color="#E5E5E5"> church has just entered and</font>

42
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,689
that was a really great show it did a

43
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,689
really good job sustaining the drama of

44
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,400
it throughout and I thought Olivia

45
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,380
Colman was amazing in it and David

46
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,560
Tennant my man was<font color="#E5E5E5"> still like on Form so</font>

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,630
just brilliant really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great show</font>

48
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,979
and I'm so watching talk to you even

49
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:32,970
though I have lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems so that</font>

50
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">January's common it's actually pretty</font>

51
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,329
good and I quite like Cara and I feel

52
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">like there was a lot of potential with</font>

53
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,960
her character when certain people

54
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,150
writing the scripts you can see the best

55
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">of her coming through but and when other</font>

56
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,689
people are actually scripts you see the

57
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,490
worst that's that coming through but I

58
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,200
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things frustrating like with</font>

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,899
the last episode<font color="#E5E5E5"> the woman from the</font>

60
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,240
future<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they just like kind of</font>

61
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,500
ignored her<font color="#CCCCCC"> and she didn't really say</font>

62
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,960
anything and I felt like that was so

63
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,820
emblematic of the problem with who at

64
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,560
the moment like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these just these</font>

65
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,840
important figures that everyone would

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
find interesting to hear from just

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,819
sidelined and not said a thing for is

68
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,959
that kind of been annoyed me and then

69
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:10,949
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing on what she goes Twin</font>

70
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,300
Peaks because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found the first season</font>

71
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">on d</font>

72
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,120
d I'm at charity shops and watching that

73
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,460
as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's kind of the</font>

74
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,660
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward for me at the moment like</font>

75
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DVDs and watching</font>

76
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,530
them I bought fourth among<font color="#CCCCCC"> those on</font>

77
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">itunes because i watch i watch that show</font>

78
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,590
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it first came out when it was first</font>

79
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,630
shown here in the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like when the</font>

80
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,460
random channels I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> watched it for</font>

81
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,620
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years and years and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kaylee is</font>

82
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,720
obsessed with it now and it's so good i

83
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,890
didn't realize that she hadn't watched

84
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,050
it until like the whole Veronica Mars

85
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,840
film started to come about and I was

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew that she would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

87
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,320
kind of I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand awake</font>

88
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,880
and watched and then no she has watched

89
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's like her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every waking breathing</font>

90
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,250
moment of her life and the other thing

91
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,690
constantly being rewatched in this flat

92
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,090
is Gilmore Girls I'm sorry my whistle

93
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,460
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> any one time when my flatmates</font>

94
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,110
will be watching an episode of gilmore

95
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,330
girls which is really nice because while

96
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,950
I'm doing what I'm doing all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

97
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,630
I can kind of hear it as an audiobook

98
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,860
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I've thought a lot</font>

99
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,630
about the West Wing like I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

100
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,610
have just all the audio from all of the

101
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,900
West Wing so I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of let</font>

102
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,120
listen to it as an audiobook and I've

103
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,560
never seen snow on my head I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

104
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to see the action i just i'd love</font>

105
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,530
to have that just in my head in my ears

106
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,240
at all times like it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

107
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,860
easy enough to do but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy</font>

108
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,410

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,520
listening to a lot of body and books at

110
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,540
the moment in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got the</font>

111
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,040
divergent audio book which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

121
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,160

123
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,410
the trashiest and yet most wonderful

124
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,209
television show in my life the moment

125
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,860
I've really embraced Shalee television

126
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,840
me my friends have reached the stage

127
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,820
where like we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very aware of all the</font>

128
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,410
problems with it but it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings us</font>

129
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,570
so much joy so that's why I watch things

130
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,390
like pretty wild and the hills and mean

131
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,790
Chelsea and it's all this crap but I

of Enki have so much love<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Louise</font>

135
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,410
especially in the last episode I feel

136
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">like its progression of the women</font>

137
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,839
standing up for themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

138
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,760
control of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> situations and</font>

139
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,470
moonlight look all you boys are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

changing for fame and hand me up and

141
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,830

142
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,010

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,690
the cool bad boys but no like that won't

144
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,430

145
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,870
know I'm missing a political drama I

146
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,940
