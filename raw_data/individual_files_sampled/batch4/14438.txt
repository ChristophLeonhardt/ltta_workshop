the wall is pretty much the first and last line of defense once someone is in America is not a totalitarian country it is not yet a surveillance state illegals can move around freely for years if you want to stop terrorists or gangs you've got to stop them in the first ditch not the last and he's so right about the money it's a fake excuse that the wall will cost too much billions tens of billions of dollars well what's the cost of all the illegals in hospitals and schools and Welfare let alone the cost of policing and private security and then there's the obvious point this isn't about money it's about a country having borders it's not about being a profit center it's about the rule of law and sovereignty even if it didn't lose money so what you do it another comparison that uses out of the military what is the point of having multibillion-dollar aircraft carriers with billions of dollars worth of fighter jets on them to attack terrorists overseas if you just let them walk right into America from Mexico I remember when the Muslim terrorists attacked the bat clan club in Paris France and the French president went on TV to noisily and showily say he was dispatching their only aircraft carrier to the Middle East yeah Monsieur the the terrorists aren't over there anymore they are in your own cities aircraft carriers not going to help you now okay Trump mentioned sanctuary cities I wish he'd use a different word there was less positive and misleading how about fugitive cities it's not a sanctuary that word is rooted in the Latin word Sanctus which means holy there is nothing holy about these terrorists or harboring them it's diabolical look at them the opposite of holy they these are the gang ms-13 that has swarmed in from Latin America after destroying countries like El Salvador and other gangs in Mexico don't use the word sanctuary which means holy don't use the word sanctuary for them they're fugitives call them fugitive cities California Democrats have set up fugitive cities where they say they will not prosecute or deport these criminals here's here's Donald Trump on that California sanctuary policies put the entire nation at risk they're the best friend of the criminal that's what exactly is happening the criminals take refuge in these sanctuary cities and it's very dangerous for our police and enforcement folks the smugglers the traffickers the gang members they're all taking refuge and I think a lot of people in California understand that a lot of people from a lot of other places understand it and they don't want sanctuary as it is are you sold I'm sold I sort of wish we had a border wall too in Canada instead Justin Trudeau has dispatched our RCMP to be the luggage concierge the bellboys to carry across the border the suitcases of the illegal migrants coming in from the US they're falsely claiming to be refugees from America there's no such thing that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
