1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:04,967
(shrill electronic music)

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,159
[Narrator] Conventional wisdom these days

3
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,599
says that robots will soon put millions

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,097
of factory workers out of jobs.

5
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:16,465
(playful electronic music)

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:20,444
This may sound like the
fever dream of Dr. Evil,

7
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,844
but in fact, there are
very pleasant people

8
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:24,427
making this happen.

9
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:28,512
May I introduce Suzanne Gildert?

10
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:30,804
A budding AI overlord and founder

11
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:33,902
of Toronto startup Kindred AI.

12
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:37,485
(playful electronic music)

13
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:45,986
Tell me about these guys.

14
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:49,154
So these are research prototypes.

15
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:52,329
So they're some of the first
robots we built at Kindred.

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,786
(mechanical sounds)

17
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,535
We tend to work with small robots.

18
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:59,115
It's a bit like if you
imagine a child growing up,

19
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:00,325
and it breaks a lot of things.

20
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:02,213
Now imagine if the child was six feet tall

21
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,772
when it had the brain of a six month old.

22
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:07,984
It would be terribly dangerous.

23
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,532
How many of these robots
have ever slapped you?

24
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:14,092
I have been hit in the face
by robots a couple of times.

25
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:16,062
(laughs)

26
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:18,513
Suzanne seems nice enough.

27
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:21,899
(upbeat electronic music)

28
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,232
She makes exotic digital art

29
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:28,539
and she loves cats to the
point where she's built

30
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,927
a robotic fleet of them for the office.

31
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:36,160
This one, I believe, is called Pinkfoot.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,087
It's a quadruped robot loosely
based on a cat anatomy,

33
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:45,087
although it's not a very highly
faithful representation yet.

34
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,419
When you were growing up you
would build things as well?

35
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,836
Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.

36
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:56,876
So I was really enthralled by
electronics at an early age.

37
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,048
I guess most little girls would be

38
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,997
looking at trays of beads and things,

39
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:01,699
and I was looking at trays of resistors

40
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,557
and capacitors and little components,

41
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,307
but having the same kind
of reaction to them.

42
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:09,470
But don't be fooled

43
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,077
by the hobby electronics
and the cute cat bots.

44
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:16,744
Suzanne is a keen businesswoman.

45
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:20,048
And Kindred has recently embarked

46
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:23,157
on its first commercial venture.

47
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:24,804
(mechanical whirring)

48
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:27,592
What's going on here is that
we have a bank of robots

49
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:31,173
that are learning, so they
are continuously running,

50
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:33,002
picking up objects.

51
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,449
These would run all day?

52
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,609
All day, all night.

53
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:40,776
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy")

54
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:44,218
Powered by state of the art AI,

55
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:47,420
these arms can do something
that's very easy for a human,

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,071
but very hard for a bot.

57
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:54,571
Pick up objects of different
shapes and put them down.

58
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:56,761
Most factories still use people

59
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:01,041
to do that sort of thing,
lots and lots of people.

60
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,652
Today everyone's shopping on e-commerce,

61
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:05,172
thousands and thousands of
different types of objects,

62
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:07,841
shapes, textures, weights.

63
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:09,721
How do you pick that up?

64
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,492
Right now it's human, so
you have millions of humans

65
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,940
in warehouses just picking up things

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,180
and putting it into another location.

67
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,620
So we're teaching our
robots how to do that.

68
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,756
(mechanical whirring sound)

69
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:23,047
What's the hard part, is it
figuring out what's a belt?

70
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:23,989
What's a shirt?

71
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,597
Or it's just, how to grasp it?

72
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:26,430
Yeah, exactly.

73
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,263
It's very hard to pick it up, right?

74
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:28,597
So things will show up
in any shape, right?

75
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:29,887
And you gotta figure out how to pick it up

76
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:32,738
without dropping it,
put it in the location,

77
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:35,238
so it takes a lot of training.

78
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,989
Part of that training involves,

79
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,822
of all things, humans.

80
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:44,269
Robot pilots who manually
control the arms while the AI

81
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,269
watches and learns the
finer points of grabbing.

82
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:50,658
Alright man, teach me
how to use this thing.

83
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:52,575
Alright, have a seat.

84
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,029
So you see a 3D mouse here,
this lets you navigate

85
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,159
the arm through three-dimensional space.

86
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,098
So imagine you're holding
the arm in that left hand

87
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:05,418
and you're just moving it around.

88
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:07,759
Move it slowly, gently.

89
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,842
There you go.

90
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,895
Trying to get the Oreos, I gotta go up.

91
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:16,853
Oh shoot, I went too far up.

92
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:18,436
I want these Oreos.

93
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,762
(Host groans)

94
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,215
(Host and George laugh)

95
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:23,512
You lose.

96
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,627
(Host and George laugh)

97
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:28,127
Come back to me, arm.

98
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,658
There. Success.

99
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:34,604
(playful electronic music)

100
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:35,517
It's like being at an arcade.

101
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:36,757
Basically.

102
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:37,590
But you actually get to win something.

103
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,423
Exactly.

104
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:41,932
(Host and George laugh)

105
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:44,022
Just down the hall, Kindred keeps a room

106
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:47,313
full of pilots doing the same thing as me.

107
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:50,721
Only these guys are actually competent.

108
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,681
They're remotely overseeing
some arms in a Gap factory

109
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:56,181
1,000 miles away in Tennessee.

110
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,201
How long have you been a robot pilot?

111
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,007
Just over a month, actually.

112
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,788
I've only been here five weeks.

113
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:07,296
What was the training process like?

114
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:10,529
Almost like playing a video game.

115
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:12,081
It's like a shirt gun?

116
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,009
That's a backpack.

117
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:13,991
That's a backpack, okay.

118
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,769
(Sai laughs)

119
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:17,049
Somebody's undies?

120
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,231
Oh, there it goes.

121
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,721
Yeah, one shirt at a time.

122
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,031
(Host and Sai laugh)

123
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,614
(mysterious chiming music)

124
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,088
As the arms observe their human guides,

125
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,918
they gradually learn how to do better

126
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,085
at picking up T-shirts and shoe boxes.

127
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,046
Eventually, they'll be fully autonomous

128
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:45,150
and Sai's services will
no longer be required.

129
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,699
One day, this is just gonna light up

130
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,659
and it's going to be picking
the objects all the time.

131
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,728
Pretty much, pretty much.

132
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,967
That's the ultimate end
goal, at least for these

133
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,859
to have it just constantly
whirring and going.

134
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,686
(robot arm whirring)

135
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:58,968
And the people will be free.

136
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,360
The people will be free to do
other more important things.

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,150
(Host and Sai laugh)

138
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,568
Sai seemed kind of happy

139
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:09,720
about the prospect of unemployment.

140
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,637
But I was concerned for his future.

141
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,446
(mechanical whirring sound)

142
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:20,044
Isn't there something grim about the human

143
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:22,024
training their end?

144
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:25,505
Yeah, it's not good to
take people's jobs away,

145
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:28,154
but this kind of technology
coming into the workforce

146
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,744
should make us start
thinking about how we're

147
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:32,886
going to pay people in the future.

148
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:37,515
Because AI is not just going
to automate manual labor jobs.

149
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,675
It's going to automate things like doctors

150
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:42,033
and lawyers and accountants very soon.

151
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,486
So I think there's gonna be issues.

152
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,033
There's gonna be a lot of disruption

153
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,533
when these things come online.

154
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,326
Suzanne is a realist,

155
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,576
but she's also an optimist.

156
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,705
In her vision of the future,

157
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:01,874
robots won't be mindless
competitors to humanity.

158
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:05,353
They'll be full-fledged
citizens like the rest of us.

159
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:07,375
One of the crazy ideas
that I see you talk about

160
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,036
was you've got a robot and
it's working in a factory

161
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:13,604
and then it's gotta go,
maybe it gets paid a wage

162
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:17,334
and it goes to buy lithium ion
batteries to keep it going.

163
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,653
Why would that have to happen?

164
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:21,204
I mean, through having a physical body,

165
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:26,204
they will have a lot of physical
needs just like we have.

166
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,924
You might have to go to their repair shop

167
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,094
to get a motor looked at
or something like that

168
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:33,014
and they'll have to
pay someone to do that.

169
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,943
I think they'll just be
contributing to our economy

170
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,745
in the same way we do.

171
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,744
(mechanical whirring)

172
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:41,116
And if they have brains
like us, they'll want

173
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,785
to explore new things
they've never seen before.

174
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:47,584
They'll want to learn things,
they'll want to perhaps rest

175
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,676
so that their mind has time to consolidate

176
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,025
all this new information.

177
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:53,289
I keep trying to picture it in my head.

178
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,582
Does the robot worker go
home and sit on the couch?

179
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:59,473
Or watch TV after work?

180
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,804
I don't see why not,
probably watch cat videos

181
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:03,048
like the rest of us.

182
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,533
(Host and Suzanne laugh)

183
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,863
It's hard to tell sometimes

184
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:09,196
if Suzanne is laughing with us or at us.

185
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:13,573
Either way, I plan to clear
a nice spot on the couch

186
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:17,674
for my robot friends, oil
up some delicious popcorn,

187
00:08:17,674 --> 00:00:00,000
and smile politely.
