I know a few people would argue that I can't admit when I'm wrong maybe more than a few people yes I see you raising your hand but I am here to admit that I have been wrong all along about one thing one thing only I've been talking about how since President Trump was elected the Democrat Party platform has morphed into a one-issue party impeaching President Trump and while they have raised millions of dollars on that platform alone as it turns out that is not what they will be leaning on to take seats in 2018 and the White House in 2020 it seems that they've run out of ideas for their take back Washington campaign and are recycling old ones namely free tuition minimum wage hikes and universal health care yes 2016 called and they want their Bernie Sanders campaign back as I'm sure you remember the DNC gave Bernie Sanders the shaft in an effort to coronate Hillary Clinton first female president crash through that glass ceiling right they didn't work out and Bernie likely isn't going to run again because how do you run a campaign out of a geriatric ward so they'll just plug any old candidate into the slot to push their message of socialism in America they're also borrowing some material from Hillary Clinton as reported by the intercept the DNC is paying one point six five million dollars for access to her email list voter data and software produced by Hillary for America during the 2016 campaign see what I mean it's 2016 again they do have a few fresh ideas and characters and of course some old ones like Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi who refused to step back and relinquish the spotlight but one of the newer shining stars is deputy chairman of the DNC keith Ellison who by the way has alleged strong ties to Muslim Brotherhood and refuses to denounce his pal Louis Farrakhan now Keith Ellison he's one of many Democrats driving the medicare-for-all issue in March he replaced John Conyers as chief sponsor of the Maine single-payer health care bill and then there's the DNC chairman Tom Perez the guy behind the lawsuit against the president Russia and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange now this guy scares the bejesus out of me because he has a scorched-earth mentality despite lacking support for the lawsuit from his own party he's ready to blaze through a pile of cash when asked about how much the lawsuit was going to cost the party on Meet the Press he said this how much money is it mil I don't know I don't know the amount of money that it will take but I'll tell you it's hard to put a price tag on preserving democracy and you know what that's why I concluded that it would be irresponsible of me not to do this I'm pretty sure there are some DNC donors who would rather the party utilize those funds to come up with some original party issues and solutions rather than litigious ly living in the past filing lawsuits that are nothing more than silly distractions as Democrats Senator Claire McCaskill called them and Bernie Sanders FTW that's for the win in millennial speak Bernie Sanders is leading the way to pass a bill that would fund a number of things particularly a minimum wage hike to $15 now how on earth would something like that get funded they don't know they literally don't know he's a senile with policy as he is in general mentality his office said they haven't yet done a cost estimate or devised how they would pay for it there's an old phrase in market finance that goes something like this the market can remain volatile longer than you can remain solvent hey Bernie people will remain greedy longer than the government with this bill can remain solvent so go back to finance school although as a socialist I'm not sure he ever really learned anything about finance or capitalism but that's kind of the new norm over there at the DNC thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoy my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.fortuigence.com
