GOOD DAY.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING HIS 
FIRST ON CAMERA COMMENTS SINCE 
ARRIVING HOME TO THE BIPARTISAN 
BACKLASH TO HIS APPEARANCE 
YESTERDAY HE STOOD ALONGSIDE THE
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN
AND APPEARED TO THROW THE 
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
UNDER THE BUS.
TRUMP WAS ASKED BY A REPORTER 
WHO HE BELIEVED WHEN IT CAME TO 
ELECTION MEDDLING IN 2016, PUTIN
OR THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES?
TRUMP SEEMED TO SIDE WITH PUTIN.
THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST SPOKEN TO
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THE 
UPROAR.
WE'LL HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY IN
A MINUTE.
FIRST, WE'LL CHECK IN WITH 
PIERRE THOMAS.
>> Reporter: I THINK THE KEY TO 
WATCH FOR IS THE PRESIDENT 
DIRECTLY ADDRESS WHERE HE 
APPEARED TO SIDE WITH PUTIN AND 
DISAGREE WITH HIS OWN 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT 
CONCLUDED EMPHATICALLY THAT THE 
RUSSIANS DID, IN FACT, TARGET 
THE 2016 ELECTION. 
>> AND ARE YOU HEARING WHAT KIND
OF RUMBLING ARE YOU HEARING FROM
THE COMMUNITY?
>> Reporter: THEIR DRAWS 
DROPPED.
THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY 
SAW THE PRESIDENT DO.
THEY WERE SHOCKED. 
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT COULD SAY TO REASSURE 
THEM COMPLETELY?
>> Reporter: WELL, WE'RE GOING 
IT HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAYS.
I KNOW THEY'RE WAITING TO SEE 
PRECISELY HOW HE ADDRESSES THE 
ISSUE. 
>> AND AS WE KNOW, WE WILL BE 
HEARING OURSELVES IN JUST A FEW 
SECONDS, AS THE VIDEO TAPE COMES
IN FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE PRESIDENT IN THE ROOSEVELT 
ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 
REPUBLICANS OF THE HOUSE WAYS 
AND MEANS COMMITTEE.
HERE HE IS. 
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
YESTERDAY I RETURNED FROM A TRIP
FROM EUROPE WHERE I MET WITH 
LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE REGION 
TO SEEK A MORE PEACEFUL FUTURE 
FOR THE UNITED STATES.
WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD WITH OUR
ALLIES AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.
WE'RE WORKING WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE PEACE.
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.
I SAY PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.
I HAVE HELPED THE NATO ALLIANCE 
GREATLY BY INCREASING DEFENSE 
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR NATO 
ALLIES BY OVER $44 BILLION, AND 
SECRETARY WAS FANTASTIC, AS YOU 
KNOW, HE REPORTED THAT THEY 
NEVER HAD AN INCREASE LIKE IN IN
THE HISTORY AND NATO IS GOING 
DOWN AS OPPOSED TO GOING UP.
I INCREASED IT BY MY MEETING 
LAST YEAR $44 BILLION.
THIS YEAR WILL BE OVER HUNDREDS 
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE 
COMING YEARS.
I THINK THERE'S GREAT UNITY WITH
NATO, AND THERE'S A LOT OF VERY 
POSITIVE THINGS HAPPENING.
THERE'S A GREAT SPIRIT THAT WE 
DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE, AND THERE'S 
A LOT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE 
PUTTING UP.
THEY WEREN'T PAYING THEIR BILLS 
ON TIME, AND NOW THEY'RE DOING 
THAT.
AND I WANT TO JUST SAY THANK YOU
VERY MUCH TO THE SECRETARY HE'S 
BEEN TERRIFIC.
WE HAD A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.
I HAD MEETINGS WITH PRIME 
MINISTER MAY ON THE RANGE OF 
ISSUES CONCERNING OUR SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT'S BETWEEN
THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 
OURSELVES.
WE MET WITH THE QUEEN, WHO WAS 
ABSOLUTELY A TERRIFIC PERSON.
SHE REVIEWED HER HONOR GUARD FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN 70 YEARS, THEY
TELL ME.
WE WALKED IN FRONT OF THE HONOR 
GUARD AND THAT WAS VERY 
INSPIRING TO SEE AND BE WITH 
HER, AND I THINK THE 
RELATIONSHIP I CAN TRULY SAY, IS
A GOOD ONE.
BUT SHE WAS VERY, VERY 
INSPIRING, INDEED.
MOST RECENTLY, I RETURNED FROM 
HELSENKE, FINLAND AND I WAS 
GOING TO GIVE A NEWS CONFERENCE 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS 
ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.
AS SUCCESSFUL AS NATO WAS, I 
THINK THIS WAS OUR MOST 
SUCCESSFUL VISIT, AND THAT HAD 
TO DO, AS YOU KNOW, WITH RUSSIA.
I MET WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT 
VLADIMIR PUTIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
TACKLE SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING
ISSUES FACING HUMANITY.
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN AT A WORSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIAN THAN 
WE ARE AS OF A FEW DAYS AGO.
I THINK THAT'S GOTTEN 
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER.
I THINK IT HAS THE POSSIBILITY 
OF GETTING MUCH BETTER.
I USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS DURING
THE CAMPAIGN GETTING ALONG WITH 
RUSSIA WOULD BE A GOOD THING.
GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA WOULD 
BE A GOOD THING.
NOT A BAD THING.
A GOOD THING.
IN FACT, A VERY GOOD THING.
RUSSIA AND US HAVE 90% OF THE 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
I'VE FELT GETTING ALONG IS A 
POSITIVE THING.
NOT JUST FOR THAT REASON.
I ENTERED THE MEETING WITH THE 
FIRM CONVICTION THAT DIPLOMACY 
AND ENGAGEMENT IS BETTER THAN 
HOSTILITY AND CONFLICT.
I FEEL THAT WITH EVERYBODY.
WE HAVE 29 MEMBERS IN NATO, AS 
AN EXAMPLE.
AND I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS 
OR AT LEAST VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERYBODY.
THE PRESS COVERED IT QUITE 
INACCURATELY.
THEY SAID I INSULTED PEOPLE.
I'M ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO PAY UP 
MONEY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY IS
INSULTING, MAYBE I DID.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU, WHEN I LEFT,
EVERYBODY WAS THRILLED AND 
THAT'S THE WAY THIS WAS, TOO.
MY MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 
WAS REALLY INTERESTING IN SO 
MANY WAYS, BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T 
HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH RUSSIA 
FOR A LONG TIME, AND WE STARTED.
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT ONCE
AGAIN, THE FULL FAITH AND 
SUPPORT FOR AMERICA'S 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, I HAVE A 
FULL FAITH IN OUR INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES.
WHOOPS, THEY TURNED OFF THE 
LIGHTS.
THAT MUST BE THE INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES.
THERE IT GOES.
OKAY.
YOU GUYS OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.
THAT WAS STRANGE.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL BEGIN BY STATING THAT I 
HAVE FULL FAITH AND SUPPORT FOR 
AMERICA'S GREAT INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES.
ALWAYS HAVE.
AND I HAVE FELT VERY STRONGLY 
THAT WHILE RUSSIA'S ACTIONS HAD 
NO EFFECT AT ALL ON THE OUTCOME 
OF THE ELECTION, LET ME BE 
TOTALLY CLEAR IN SAYING THAT, 
AND I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES, I
ACCEPT OUR INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITIES' CONCLUSION THAT 
RUSSIA'S MEDDLING IN THE 2016 
ELECTION TOOK PLACE.
COULD BE OTHER PEOPLE, ALSO.
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT 
THERE.
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION AT ALL.
AND PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THAT.
THEY'VE SEEN THAT STRONGLY.
THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY COME OUT 
VERY STRONGLY ON THAT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT 
STRONGLY ON THAT.
I THOUGHT THAT I MADE MYSELF 
VERY CLEAR BY HAVING JUST 
REVIEWED THE TRANSCRIPT.
NOW I HAVE TO SAY, I CAME BACK 
AND I SAID WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
SO I GOT A TRANSCRIPT, I 
REVIEWED IT.
I ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND REVIEWED
IT WITH AN ANSWER I GAVE, AND I 
REALIZE THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME
CLARIFICATION.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS, I 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OBVIOUS, BUT
I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY, IN CASE
IT WASN'T, IN A KEY SENTENCE IN 
MY REMARKS, I SAID THE WORD 
"WOULD" INSTEAD OF WITH THE 
WOULDN'T."
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN I DON'T SEE 
ANY REASON WHY I WOULDN'T OR WHY
IT WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA.
SO JUST TO REPEAT IT.
I SAID THE WORD "WOULD" INSTEAD 
OF" WOULDN'T."
AND THE SENTENCE WAS I THOUGHT I
WOULD BE MAYBE A LITTLE UNCLEAR 
ON THE TRANSCRIPT OR THE VIDEO.
THE SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, I
DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY IT 
WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA.
SORT OF A DOUBLE NEGATIVE.
SO YOU CAN PUT THAT IN.
AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY 
CLARIFIES THINGS PRETTY GOOD BY 
ITSELF.
I HAVE ON, NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, 
NOTED OUR INTELLIGENCE FINDINGS 
THAT RUSSIANS ATTEMPTED TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS.
UNLIKE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS,
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY TO
REPEAL ANY EFFORTS AND REPEL.
WE'LL STOP IT, WE'LL REPEL IT.
ANY EFFORTS TO INTERFERE IN OUR 
ELECTIONS.
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR 
POWER TO PREVENT RUSSIAN 
INTERFERENCE IN 2018, AND WE 
HAVE A LOT OF POWER.
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS
GIVEN INFORMATION JUST PRIOR TO 
THE ELECTION, THE LAST ELECTION,
2016, AND THEY DECIDED NOT TO DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THE REASON THEY DECIDED THAT WAS
PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ALL.
THEY THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS
GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION.
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A BIG 
DEAL.
WHEN I WON THE ELECTION, THEY 
THOUGHT IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WENT INTO 
ACTION.
BUT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LATE.
SO HE WAS GIVEN THAT IN SHARP 
CONTRAST TO THE WAY IT SHOULD 
BE.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, ALONG WITH 
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER AND THE 
WHOLE GROUP THAT YOU SEE ON 
TELEVISION NOW PROBABLY GETTING 
PAID A LOT OF MONEY BY YOUR 
NETWORKS, THEY KNEW ABOUT 
RUSSIA'S ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE IN
THE ELECTION IN SEPTEMBER.
THEY TOTALLY BURIED IT.
AS I SAID, THEY BURIED IT 
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT 
HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO 
WIN.
IT TURNED OUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 
THAT WAY.
BY CONTRAST, MY ADMINISTRATION 
IS TAKING A VERY FIRM STANCE.
IT'S A FIRM STANCE ON A STRONG 
ACTION.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE STRONG 
ACTION TO SECURE OUR ELECTION 
SYSTEMS AND THE PROCESS.
FURTHER MORE, AS HAS BEEN STATED
AND WE'VE STATED PREVIOUSLY IN 
MANY OCCASIONS, NO COLLUSION.
YESTERDAY WE MADE SIGNIFICANT 
PROGRESS TOWARD IMPRESSING SOME 
OF THE WORST CONFLICTS ON EARTH.
WHEN I MET WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 
FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS,
AND AMONG THOSE THINGS ARE THE 
PROBLEMS THAT YOU SEE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST WHERE THEY ARE VERY 
MUCH INVOLVED.
WE ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED.
I ENTERED THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN FROM A POSITION 
OF TREMENDOUS STRENGTH.
OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING.
AND OUR MILITARY IS BEING FUNDED
$700 BILLION THIS YEAR.
$716 BILLION NEXT YEAR.
IT WILL BE MORE POWERFUL AS A 
MILITARY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD 
BEFORE.
PRESIDENT PUTIN AND I ADDRESSED 
A RANGE OF ISSUES STARTING WITH 
THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA, AND NEED
FOR HUMANITARIAN AID AND HELP 
FOR PEOPLE IN SYRIA.
WE ALSO SPOKE OF IRAN AND THE 
NEED TO HOLD THE NUCLEAR 
AMBITIONS AND THE DESTABILIZING 
ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN IRAN,
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW WE ENDED THE
IRAN DEAL WHICH WAS ONE OF THE 
WORST DEALS ANYONE COULD 
IMAGINE.
AND THAT'S HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON
IRAN AND SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKENED 
IRAN.
AND WE HOPE AT SOME POINT IRAN 
WILL CALL US AND MAYBE WE'LL 
MAKE A NEW DEAL.
MAYBE WE WON'T.
BUT IRAN IS NOT THE SAME COUNTRY
IT WAS FIVE MONTHS AGO.
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
THEY ARE NO LONGER LOOKING SO 
MUCH TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AND 
THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST.
THEY HAVE BIG PROBLEMS THAT THEY
CAN SOLVE PROBABLY MUCH EASIER 
IF THEY DEAL WITH US.
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT WE DID DISCUSS.
WE DISCUSSED ISRAEL AND THE 
SECURITY OF ISRAEL.
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN IS VERY MUCH
INVOLVED NOW WITH US.
AND THE DISCUSSION WITH 
NETANYAHU ON WORKING SOMETHING 
OUT ON WORKING SOMETHING OUT 
WITH SURROUNDING SYRIA, AND 
SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE
SECURITY AND LONG-TERM SECURITY 
OF CENTRAL ISRAEL.
A MAJOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION WAS 
NORTH KOREA, THE NEED TO REMOVE 
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
RUSSIA HAS ASSURED US OF ITS 
SUPPORT.
PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS HE AGREES 
WITH HIS 100% AND THEY WILL DO 
WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO TO MAKE
IT HAPPEN.
DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING AND 
GOING WELL.
WE HAVE NO RUSH FOR SPEED.
THE SANCTIONS ARE REMAINING.
THE HOSTAGES ARE BACK.
THERE HAVE BEEN NO TESTS.
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ROCKETS GOING
UP FOR A PERIOD OF NINE MONTHS.
AND I THINK THE RELATIONSHIPS 
ARE VERY GOOD.
SO WELL SEE HOW THAT GOES.
.
WE HAVE NO TIME LIMIT AND NO 
SPEED LIMIT.
WE ARE JUST GOING THREW THE 
PROCESS.
BUT THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY 
GOOD.
PRESIDENT PUTIN IS GOING TO BE 
INVOLVED IN THE SENSE THAT HE 
IS -- HE IS WITH US AND WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.
PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE
WE DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING 
PRIOR TO THE PRESS CONFERENCE 
WAS THE REDUCTION OF NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 
HAVE 90%, AS I SAID, AND WE CAN 
HAVE A BIG IMPACT.
BUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS I THINK 
THE GREATEST THREAT OF OUR WORLD
TODAY.
AND THEY'RE A GREAT NUCLEAR 
POWER.
WE ARE A GREAT NUCLEAR POWER.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
NUCLEAR.
AND SO THAT WAS A MATTER THAT WE
DISCUSSED ACTUALLY IN GREAT 
DETAIL.
AND PRESIDENT PUTIN AGREES WITH 
ME.
THE MATTERS WE DISCUSSED ARE 
PROFOUND IN THEIR IMPORTANCE AND
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE 
MILLIONS OF LIVES.
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MANY 
DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN OUR 
COUNTRIES.
BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE 
DIALOGUE -- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
IT, DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA OR 
DIALOGUE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES 
BUT DIALOGUE IN THIS CASE WHERE 
WE HAVE HAD SUCH POOR 
RELATIONSHIPS FOR SO MANY YEARS.
DIALOGUE IS A VERY IMPORTANT 
THING AND A GOOD THING.
SO IF WE GET ALONG WITH THEM, 
DRAET.
IF WE DON'T GET ALONG WITH THEM 
THEN WE WON'T GET ALONG WITH 
THEM.
BUT I THINK WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 
CHANCE OF HAVING SOME VERY 
POSITIVE THINGS.
I THOUGHT THE MEETING I HAD WITH
PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS REALLY 
STRONG.
I THINK THAT THEY WERE WILLING 
TO DO THINGS THAT, FRANKLY I 
WASN'T SURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO.
AND WE'LL BE HAVING FUTURE 
MEETINGS.
AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER OR NOT 
THAT COMES TO FRUITION.
BUT WE HAD A VERY VERY GOOD 
MEETING.
I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR UP -- I 
HAVE THE STRONGEST RESPECT FOR 
OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HEADED
BY MY PEOPLE.
WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE, WHETHER 
IT'S GINA, DAN COATES, ANY OF 
THEM.
I MEAN WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 
PEOPLE.
TREMENDOUS TALENT WITHIN THE 
AGENCIES.
I THINK THEY'RE BEING GUIDED 
PROPERLY.
AND WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING.
WE WANT SUCCESS FOR OUR COUNTRY.
SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO 
START A MEETING NOW ON TAX 
REDUCTIONS.
WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING IN A 
BILL, KEVIN BRADY IS WITH US.
AND I MIGHT ASK KEVIN TO SAY A 
COUPLE OF WORDS ABOUT THAT.
AND THEN WE'LL GET BACK TO 
PRIVATE MEETING.
BUT KEVIN COULD YOU MAYBE GIVE A
BRIEF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WE 
WE'LL BE TALK ETALKING ZBRA OKAY
WE'RE CUTTING IN HERE YOU JUST 
HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAK IN 
THE ROOSEVELT ROOM AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
HIS FIRST ON CAMERA COMMENTS 
SINCE ARRIVING BACK HOME AFTER 
THE CONTROVERSY HE SPARKED OVER 
IN HELSINKI, FINLAND WHEN HE 
APPEARED ALONGSIDE THE RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN.
AND APPEARED TO SIDE WITH PUTIN 
OVER AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES ON THE QUESTION OF 2016
ELECTION MEDDLING.
RIGHT THERE HE SAID, HOWEVER, HE
DOES ACCEPT THE CONCLUSIONS AND 
THAT HE STRONGLY SUPPORTS AND 
APPRECIATES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF
THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES.
LET'S BRING IN ABC'S CHIEF 
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PIERRE 
THOMAS WHO COVERS THE 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES FOR US.
PIERRE, THE PRESIDENT SATISFIES 
CASE SEEMED TO WHITTLE DOWN TO 
WONDER WON WORD.
HE SAID YESTERDAY ON THE PODIUM 
UP NEXT TO VLADIMIR PUTIN WHEN 
ASKED WHETHER THE RUSSIAN 
MEDDLED, HE SAID I DON'T SEE ANY
REASON WHY IT WOULD BE RUSSIA.
BUT HE SAID TODAY WHAT HE MEANT 
TO SAY HE MEANT TO SAY I DON'T 
SEE ANY REASON WHY IT WOULDN'T 
BE RUSSIA.
WILL THAT ONE WORD TWEAK BE 
ENOUGH TO SATISFY SOURCES OVER 
IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY, DAN BUT THE
PRESIDENT IS BASICALLY SAYING HE
MISSPOKE.
HE INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT RUSSIA
HAD EVERY REASON TO WANT TO 
ATTACKS THE ELECTION BUT THAT'S 
NOT HOW IT CAME ACROSS.
AND HE CERTAINLY DID NOT ATTACK 
THE RUSSIANS FOR WHAT THEY DID.
AND THAT'S WHAT SOME IN THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WANTED 
HIM TO DO.
FRANKLY THEY WANTED HIM TO ISSUE
A STATEMENT ALONG THE LINE THAT 
IS DON'T DO IT AGAIN.
AND THEY DIDN'T GET THAT.
TODAY, THEY SAW THE PRESIDENT 
ATTEMPT TO BASICALLY EXPRESS HIS
FULL SUPPORT.
HE SAID HE HAD FAITH IN THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
THAT THEY -- HE SUPPORTED THEM.
BUT YESTERDAY IT DIDN'T APPEAR 
TO BE.
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN AS TO 
WHETHER THEY WILL ACCEPT BHA HE 
SAID TODAY, DAN. 
>> AND THE CONCERN GOES BEYOND 
NOT ACCEPTING OR APPEARING NOT 
TO ACCEPT THEIR CONCLUSION AT 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN 
HELSINKI YESTERDAY.
AND IT GOES BEYOND NOT ATTACKING
THE RUSSIANS WHO ARE ATTACKING 
US.
BUT ALSO WHAT THE "WALL  STREET 
JOURNAL" IN THEIR EDITORIAL 
TODAY -- THE "WALL  STREET 
JOURNAL" NOT KNOWN TO BE A LEFT 
LEANING PUBLICATION REFERRED TO 
AS A BESEECHING DEMEANOR BY THE 
U.S. PRESIDENT IN THE PRESENCE 
OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT.
WILL THE COMMENTS TODAY BE 
ENOUGH TO TAKE SOME OF THE EDGE 
OFF THAT. 
>> DAN, I THINK THE BIG QUESTION
REMAINING IS THE WHY.
WHY DID THE PRESIDENT ACT THE 
WAY HE DID YESTERDAY?
NOW SOME PEOPLE SUPPORTERS WHO 
I'VE TALKED TO IN THE PAST 
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
ANGRY THAT HIS ELECTION WIN WAS 
TAINTED BY HACKING BY RUSSIANS.
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE 
KNOWS HE DIDN'T COLLUDE AND HE 
IS FRUSTRATED.
AND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO AREN'T 
SURE ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE.
THAT'S THE QUESTION REMAINS.
WHY HAS HE BEEN SO WILLING TO 
NOT PROVOKE PUTIN?
>> PIERRE THOMAS.
THANK YOU.
LET'S BRING IN ABC'S TOREY MORAN
IN HELSINKI.
HE WAS IN THE ROOM DURING THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY.
TERRY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
DOMESTIC POLITICS OF THIS.
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN 
HEAT FROM MANY WHO ARE NORMALLY 
IN HIS CORNER PB THE FORMER 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT 
GINRICH CALLING THIS THE SINGLE 
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS 
PRESIDENCY.
DO YOU THINK WHAT WE JUST HEARD 
INCLUDING THE TWEAK FROM THE 
WORD WOULD TO WOULDN'T WILL HELP
THE PRESIDENT WITH HIS ALLIES?
>> I DO, DAN, BECAUSE THE 
AMERICAN POLITICS RIGHT NOW HAS 
LESS TO DO WITH WHO YOU BELIEVE 
IN SOME WAYS THAN WHO YOU HATE, 
FRANKLY.
AND DONALD TRUMP HAS A GENIUS IN
GETTING PEOPLE ON THAT TURF.
AS LONG AS HE DOES A JOB OF 
EXPRESSING FAITH IN THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND 
EXPLAINING WHAT HE DID HERE, 
JUST IN THAT BUILDING BEHIND ME 
SAYING HE MISSPOKE HE WILL RALLY
I THINK HIS TROOPS BECAUSE HE IS
SHIFTING THE GROUND TO IT'S OOB,
THE LIBERALS, THE MEDIA, THE 
DEMOCRATS.
I THINK THAT WILL HELP HIM.
I THINK, HOWEVER, THERE WILL BE 
SOME WHO HAVE A LINGERING BAD 
FEELING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THAT BUILDING BEHIND ME.
AND MIGHT NOTE THAT IT'S BEEN 30
HOURS SINCE HE MISSPOKE.
HE HAS GIVEN TWO INTERVIEWS 
SINCE THEN TO TUCKER CARLSON AND
TO SEAN HANNITY OF FOX NEWS AND 
TWEETS AS HE CAME HOME AND HE 
NEVER REALIZED OR RESPONDED IN 
THIS WAY THAT HE HAD MISSPOKEN.
ONE MORE THING.
IT MAY BE ONE THING TO RALLY THE
DOMESTIC AUDIENCE.
IT'S QUITE ANOTHER TO CHANGE THE
PERCEPTION OF PEOPLE AROUND THE 
WORLD WHO SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN 
THAT ROOM, READ AND SAW THE 
BESEECHING DEMEANOR, THE 
SUBSERVIENT DEMEANOR THAT THE 
"WALL  STREET JOURNAL" JOET 
FLOATED.
I WAS IN BRUT WHEN BARACK OBAMA 
DREW THE RED LYNN AND SAID THE 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA
WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED AND 
FOLLOWED BY MILITARY ACTION.
AND HE BLINKED HE NEVER 
RECOVERED IN THE ARAB WORLD.
AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT HIM 
CHANGED AROUND THE WORLD.
I THINK THE WORLD, CERTAINLY 
WORLD LEADERS THEY SAW A MAN 
ONE-ON-ONE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN 
WHO WAS SUBSERVIENT, BEE 
SEARCHING AS THE "WALL  STREET 
JOURNAL" PUTS IT.
THAT'S HARD FOR DONALD TRUMP TO 
OVERCOMING. 
>> THE GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS WILL
CONTINUE TO UNFOLD AND THE 
POLITICAL FORCES HERE AT HOME AS
WELL BECAUSE THERE IS SOME TALK 
THAT CONGRESS MAY TAKE ACTION.
WE'LL OF COURSE BE FOLLOWING 
THAT.
ABC EASTERY MORAN AND PIERRE 
THOMAS WE THANK YOU BOTH.
AGAIN THE PRESIDENT, THE 
BREAKING NEWS TODAY EXPRESSING 
FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AFTER HIS 
CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS OVERSEAS 
IN HELSINKI WITH THE RUS
