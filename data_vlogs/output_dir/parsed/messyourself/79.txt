house but I can deal with them I do have
to freak out moments everyone wants you

happens in America but overall you know
I've come to accept Shelby's passions
thing about cockroaches is that someday
in the near future that they will go
away okay don't watch yourself videos

cute and funny oh god what's in there
Sardinia wretches she is pregnant and
you can see her a casing in the back of
her adamant there to noise over his
sanam the exoskeleton is there bones on
the outside their body they each other
exhales calculators no white for just
say a couple of hours and then they get
their normal color back they may be a
little stinky once in a while this is a
taxidermy middle I use them to clean up
the dead bugs in my cage so it doesn't
smell so bad
taxidermy needles because they eat the
flesh off bones oh this goes bloody
crazy okay this is the craziest
I've ever seen in my entire life okay
man if my daughter even tried even tried
to do this okay no no no she she's very
going sitting outside with the bloody
cockroaches I swear to God alright so we
got a new clip now what is this kids
obsession covers
okay
this kid is obsessed with fans TLC find
these da mosque it's okay
my name is Reese I'm tired of 11 years
old that I collect fans collected
collects fans wow I thought I was kind
of a strange thing to collect yeah no
 you dumbass mother I have about 200
fans fans list it's a homeless pedestal
fan the reason I bought it
these blades table fans this is a
fanimation of urban yet I kind of like
the phones from a 1950's Cadillac fans
are slim so they can fit in this is okay
this guy's so happy about showing off
his fans I don't give a about them
I always had a rule about not collecting
ceiling fans 1980 hunter original say 22
alright okay we got it you know you know
your stuff about fans my first thought
was when will it stop yeah when will it
stop why are you encouraging it look you
even got a picture all this doubles kid
with a fan okay
oh no no fact for you my first memory
with Reese with fans is probably
eighteen months to two years old
what kind of two-year-old would have
fans okay I was sucking on titties at
two years old okay and this guy's
by the fans I'm somewhat obsessed with
fans it's just the way the fans look
what a nice air yes that is quite
beautiful isn't it
I started collecting fans when I was
three and I'm still collecting fans and
now that I'm 11
I've been collecting for eight long
years
oh wait first man I had it was galaxy
while Alaska box okay he goes in the
computer several hours a week looking
for another galaxy by Alaska I just love
that thing but I can never find one it's
like as if it's trying to escape me okay
so that kid was obsessed with fans okay
dumb dumb ass thirteen year old
Logan halls at Sibley Iowa likes more
than the sound of one of his over 100
vacuum cleaners is the feeling of one in
his hands I feel joy when I vacuum yeah
obsessed with vacuum cleaners now like I
said only this dog shape would happen in
America this is America
listen come over to my house okay we've
got something Mac keeping that needs to
be done he gets up in the morning he
kicks the vacuum on I can use this
better then we comes downstairs vacuums
living through my living room through
the dining room and then kitchen and he
come home from school then vacuum again
makes me feel kind of annoyed because he
can't really concentrate enough and it's
just vacuuming oh now he's thinking
him on a bike ride I usually like to go
to other place at the vacuum my mom
works at the hair salon
I like to go there I like the gold air
and vacuum obviously and do some
vacuuming of the hair and of course we
need it done daily and so he will come
down and do it daily here oh my god and
when I'm done at my mom's salon
my dad's a fire chief fire hall
I like having Logan down here at the
fire hall because firemen are the
dirtiest guys in the world sometimes
which can't help and he's takes care of
he's like my maid if you will he's like
my maid my son's like my maid - this guy
is father of the year right now but he
makes sure he cleans I had to clean his
trucks in northwest Iowa okay and if he
runs out of trucks to do and the floors
to do you'll be out the base sucking up
the cracks sucking on the cracks okay
that sounds kind of weird and I keep on
vacuuming until it's all done and then I
repeat every day oh boy what a waste of
your time do something totally is a
small town everyone knows everyone and
they may not know us directly but
they'll be like hey your son's the
vacuum kid this mop is owned by a son
being the vacuum kid would you be kind
of disappointed with your son you know I
would you know and I would express that
every day with my son my next thing you
know we're receiving back it was from
these people that were broken and most
of people thought oh just let it play
with them and experiment with some of
things like that
but now he's repairing vacuums okay now
he's repairing them and handing it back
to him so here's your vacuum bag and
they're going I just gave it to you to
play with I didn't expect it return and
working condition whoa okay
I wanted to add to my collection okay I
created a business Logan here who works
vacuum cleaner repairs okay now we're
talking baby all right this kid took his
obsession which is kind of weird I'm not
gonna lie and actually turn it into a
business okay now I like him every time
a vacuum cleaner I feel like it
detective trying to find out a crime
screen I usually try to dig deep far
into the vacuum if I find something odd
looking I always take that apart and put
a new one back in okay and then alright
pull it away it could the most important
part about fixing a vacuum cleaner is
having to test the vacuum cleaner to see
if it runs I use glitter as my test dust
because it's one of the hardest
substitutes to vacuum up
you picked the back here
is that it
okay guys I'm going to end the video
there that was me watching these dumb
TLC shows a TLC you know makes for great
reaction content so if we reach 30,000
likes on this video I will make another
video either on this show or another TLC
show thank you guys so much for watching
