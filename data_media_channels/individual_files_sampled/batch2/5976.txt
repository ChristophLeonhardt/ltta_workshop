well back to what joe teased at the top of the show just hours after President Trump spoke on Friday the communications director for the group behind CPAC Ian Walters made a controversial statement about the election of Michael Steele as Republican National Committee Chair in 2009 we had just elected the first African American president and that was a big deal and a little bit of cynicism what do we do this is a terrible thing we elected Mike Steele to be the RNC chair because he's a black guy that was the wrong thing to do mm I just what Walters later apologized Steele and the chairman of the american conservative union match slap who stood next to walters we made the mark appeared on steel Sirius XM radio show this should be good you have been rather critical of some of the more conservative aspects of the Trump phenomenon and this Trump Roger I think what Ian was getting to the heart of that was there are people who are critics of some of the things you did is you can chairman what the hell is that my race have to do with any of that at the end of the day what does the color of my skin have to do with anything you just said so you mean to tell me that as a black conservative put it in that context but let alone as a conservative I can't be critical of the president you can be but there's you know that there are a lot of people I think take race out of it yeah if you look at the criticism but he injected raised into it yeah that was the eye I would agree with you so again those words that tumbled out of his mouth right I believed were unfortunate words it was stupid not unfortunate you call it what it is don't take the worst out of what he said you know him I know but this is where you need to have some grace look at what is in it what the hell do I have to be grateful for you do not been very grateful you've not been very grateful to the Republicans and the Conservatives in this and in this room for a very long period of time oh my god it's just like Michael I will just turn it floor of the you again I want that viewers to know I've known Matt for a long time that for a long time and Matt for a long time it's been considered very reasonable one of the good guys yeah I've known Matt a long time too and we've been as I said at the beginning of that interview we've been through a lot of Wars together but that was a moment for the Hmong many in that interview in those nine minutes in which I saw Matt not just drink the kool-aid but take the ivy and plunge it into his arm and and it is it was stunning and disappointing the fact that he would then twist this back and say oh well yeah this because you were a lousy chairman well you know like and I gave a damn about that I knew people didn't want me to be chairman I knew people didn't like it I was chairman I was not their typical chairman but my goal was to do two things raise money win elections and we did that and there's never been that level of respect for that and that was brought out there but even beyond that Joe the fact of the matter is that this party will then pivot as it is doing today to have a luncheon to celebrate african-american trailblazers really you're gonna have that conversation when you say about the first black chairman well cut that was a mistake what the hell did we know it was taken then again if Matt was going to apologize he should have come on the show and apologized but again there were three takeaways one you deserved it because you've been critical of Donald Trump so racist comments were mitigated by the fact even critical of Donald Trump right and then the second thing was he said you were making it about race when they're the ones that made the whole thing about race and then finally the third thing is he said you needed to show grace when he not was the I beep whinging he was the one who made the racially insensitive or that's right I would say racist remarks Susan I just I know you have a question for Michael I do just want to say just for people watching at home Michael Steele ran the Republican Party from 2009 to 2011 during their most successful run during a record-setting legislative landslide they took him out in 2011 and of course Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012 so if you're talking about results there is no contest between what Michael still did and what others did before him and the other thing that Michael did so well Joe is that it was also still an inclusive party yes it was the Moochie party movement but there was still room for other Republicans to be part of it he was inclusive this Republican Party I don't even recognize the party of Trump I hate to call it the Republican party because Michael I as a woman in the Republican Party it's always been a little difficult to go to some of the extreme positions that some have had and I know for any conservative african-american they've also faced the same challenges kind of from the left and the right you get beat around so the central challenge now has nothing to do with that it's the hate that has intruded the party and to me that's what I'm most concerned about we used to fight about policies or be concerned and where does the party go I'm concerned that we may not come back after four or six years are we moving into a fractured state yeah I think that's exactly the point and it is the fear that a lot of a lot of folks have who've watched the disintegration of the party in that space you know we talked about building and expanding and growing at the same time recognizing the challenges and the opportunities and saying how do we relate that and translate that to everybody not just the folks who sound and look like us but everyone and I used to say a lot and joke priming members as I always talked about taking the party outside of its comfort zone well what's happening now it has retrenched into a very comfortable corner and everything outside of that corner is not good for it in its view it wants to attack it it wants to avoid it it doesn't want to engage with it in an open way and this trump efficacious of the party is not just dangerous it's deadly to its future and I think people need to be aware of that this president has given countenance to what you have saw unfold on that stage with myself and and Mona this president has given countenance to that and and communities of color women everyone Americans look at that and they are processing it separately and going is like me does that reflect me is that how I am and as a Republican I won't stand for it anymore I just won't a lot of younger people are also reacting that's that's actually and if you if you look at the numbers it's younger Americans are reacting viscerally against this educated Republicans as especially suburban Republicans you just look at the numbers and boy it's a meltdown thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click
