Donald Trump's signed off on moves to tackle foreign interference in US elections which he describes as a national emergency the president's issued an executive order which refers to any attempt by individuals or countries to influence or alter vote results now the reason that he's so concerned about all this is because a lot rides on those crucial midterm elections which are coming up in November now in the event that any meddling is Provins sanctions would be imposed targeting strategic areas like finance defense through to technology and transport our Washington correspondent Sameera Kahn's been taking a closer look the order will authorize sanctions against entities charged with election meddling this applies to accompanies organizations and even individuals the term entity means a partnership association trust joint venture corporation group sub group or other organizations now if impose these sanctions will a block assets limit access to the US financial system and ban people from entering the country in the order Trump admitted that no foreign power has ever successfully influenced a u.s. election but he signed the order anyway although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering the outcome or vote tabulation in any United States election foreign powers have historically sought to exploit America's free and open political system now it's also important to note that the order did not specify any country in particular the term foreign government means any national state provincial or other governing authority any political party or any official of any governing authority or political party in each case of a country other than the United States these sanctions will also be imposed on anyone accused of spreading propaganda and disinformation and the authority determined who's been meddling has been granted to the Director of National Intelligence the State Department the Treasury Department Homeland Security and the Justice Department with 45 days to do so legal and media analyst Lionel believes the executive orders vague unlike previous documents of its kind but a couple of things I want to bring up using the canons of American law which I know a little bit about and whenever we look at any statute any statute law regulation executive order PDD you name it anything that is written one of the tenets that we always look to is are the behaviors are the prohibited actions are those intended activities spelled out accurately enough and with specificity enough so that you are able to read the particular executive order read the statute and comport accordingly meaning may I read this and say oh I know what to do now the next thing is sometimes we have terms void for vagueness vagueness ambiguity what is interference and I don't want to do this the air quotes but imagine I'm doing it what is interference what is propaganda what is wanting to affect having an effect and I can come up with a lot of terms interpretations new ones if I tweak the the Verity the veracity what does this mean I don't even understand how you would even apply this because normally when you look at the statute it says interference shall mean this it means it does not mean this the dissemination of an idea discussion debate what does that what when any country has any discussion I think there is an effect so it's it's very concerned it concerns me for vagueness and ambiguity what it is is the US presidency responding to the domestic media and any doubts that people might have of foreign interference in the election the substance of it really is not material because there are not going to be any measurable indications of foreign interference in the election certainly not with those rigging or vote amping in any event so so basically this is a public relations exercise from the White House you
