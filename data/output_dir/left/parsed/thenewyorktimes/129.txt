He’s the one who
famously said,
"I'd take a bullet
for Donald Trump."
Well, now that he’s
looking at prison time
we’ll see if he’s
willing to take a dick.
People think that prisoners
deserve whatever they get.
A police report described him
as 5-foot-9 and 140 pounds.
Or as his cellmate
put it, just right.
I was forced to
perform oral sex
on several inmates. 
I was told:
"You aren’t going to fight back, 
are you sweetness?"
You're going to be going back 
to the showers.
And the only speed you’re going to reach is 88 dudes per hour.
Someone’s going through that now.
Someone's going through that right now.
And to make a joke about it,
it’s a slap in the face.
Being raped or sexually assault in prison
is not part of the punishment.
No one deserves that.
We’re still human beings.
There’s no guards that sit right here.
There’s nothing.
There was nothing.
It's like they had to to come from way over here,
which is the booking area,
to come and see anything
that was going on in here.
–Hey.
–Meg, what the hell are you doing in here?
–Shower time.
–What are you doing with that loofah?
–Don't worry about it.
I was taking a shower
and in comes a guy.
Cartoon character: (screaming)
You told me not to worry about it.
He says, "Bitch, face
the fucking wall.
Or I'll break your fucking neck."
I felt like dirt. I felt like I
didn’t even exist.
I was just there.
My bunk was tapped by a
guy who then explained
to me that he owned
me.
He had purchased me
from the guy who
anally raped me
for $20 worth of
commissary items.
And I was now his property.
He was my prison husband.
If he wanted to utilize
me to pay off gambling debts,
I could be bartered.
Talking to staff would
have been the end of my life.
Staff actually
came on the tier,
and my husband was saying,
"Watch what I can make my ho do,"
and he made me dance for him
and the staff members.
They all laughed about it.
Staff shook his head
and walked out the door.
Like, “Oh, man, y’all crazy.”
Next up is Pearl,
A.k.a. Lil’ Bitch.
I wonder who Big Bitch is.
That would be me.
Lucky you.
I had to sit down to urinate.
I had to face the
wall to shower.
I was not allowed at
any point in time
to have any mention
of me being a man
or having a penis.
I had to wear a tucker
to pull back the genitals
to give the appearance
of a vagina.
It’s extremely painful
to wear most of the time.
I had to wear it all of the time.
May just be as simple as me
raising my voice and
getting smacked, to me
referring to myself as a
he and getting punched.
Any type of deviation
from his rules
were the threat of violence.
I lost me here.
I lost my humanity here.
I lost my identity here.
I lost myself here.
So the memories
are coming back,
so you’re mad and it’s like I’m
angry or something, at the building.
It’s a weird feeling.
And the people
who can make the change,
the people who can affect the
change make jokes about it.
If the story is heard,
and it’s addressed,
and we can stop
making the joke of
it, someone won’t have
to go through this
one day. Someone
can go to prison,
do their time.
They can rectify
their mistake, they
can get their second chance.
We have to start
thinking of it like that.
They are people,
they are just people
and no person deserves that.
