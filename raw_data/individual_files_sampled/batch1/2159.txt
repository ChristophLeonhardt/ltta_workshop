I made a decision of that I wasn't gonna treat fitness as an important part of my schedule but I was gonna give it the same priority I would give a meeting or time with a friend or time at home my life would have a head and I get busy people want to see me so I said look you know I'm not gonna cancel my workout but you'd come if you want and I found it was it was an interesting way to begin to connect with people and that's what led to beginning to build up a group fitness activity the program is a group of like-minded people both men and women in a broad array of Ages and fitness levels who get together for morning's a week at 6:00 in the morning to do something different each of those four days all fitness related it's an incredibly cooperative group there's no trash talking and there's no unpleasantness I think people come and they feel elevated by what we do and there are people of all different levels of fitness there's no cost it's free there are a number of people in the program who early in their career and wouldn't necessarily be able to afford to go to some of the places we go to we just decided as it came together that we would just keep money out of the program so I'm the benefactor to join the program you may have read about it or you have a friend who's in it or you meet me an express interest will invite someone to a session and it's self-selects with the program the average age is somewhere around 28 I'm able to sort of draft on there energy and you know perhaps they can learn something for me
