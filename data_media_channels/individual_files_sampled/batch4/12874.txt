I want to focus for just a minute on this kind of silly thing that happened between Sean Hannity and Jimmy Kimmel I understand this is a country where everyone's had the lincoln-douglas debates and now we have Hannity and Kimmel's you're shouting homosexual slur slurs at one another but it's important to just watch this because people make fun of Hannity especially like the intellectuals but Hannity could teach them all a lesson right here Kimmel went out and he made fun of the first lady's accent she was reading books to children on Easter and he made fun do we have that clip yep Oh White House Easter celebration would be complete without storytime from our first lady never stop exploring cuz life would be boring be clever and curious just like a cat ask lots of questions about this and that here Moe you realize what this means you could be First Lady of the United States so so Hannity goes after him on Twitter says stop picking on a woman who can't fight back and he calls him mr. Harvey Weinstein jr. because he says because of shows he did that he remember he had the man show and he was always doing these hoaxes on girls in the street and so he played a couple of them Hannity just said I'm gonna just play all this stuff to remind you of who Jimmy Kimmel is in this world of me too and he played here's a clip of Kimmel going out on the street and playing this prank on girls were going by guess what's in my pants now I've stopped something in my pants and you're allowed to feel around on the outside of the pants you had 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants you ready set go you should use two hands two hands sure just won't stop and he just hammers Kimmel and he hammers him and he keeps bringing up the creepy jokes and he keeps bringing up the creepy jokes and finally Kimmel surrenders haven't Hannity says I'm gonna keep at you until you apologize to the first lady and Kimmel finally sends out a tweet saying well I admit I did have fun with our back-and-forth after some thought I realized that the level of vitriol from all sides mine and me included does nothing good for anyone and in fact is harmful to our country even in 2018 the vile attacks against my wife and wishes for death on my infant son is shocking and I encourage those who made them to give their words and actions thought I too will give my words more thought and recognize my role in inciting their hatefulness I will take Sean Hannity at his word that he was genuinely offended what I buy what I believed and still believed to be a harmless and silly aside referencing our first lady's accent mrs. Trump almost certainly has enough to worry about without being used as a prop to increase TV ratings
