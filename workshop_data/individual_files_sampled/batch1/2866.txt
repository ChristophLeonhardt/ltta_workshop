gee thanks for being with us today what was the original vision behind break and how has that evolved I think you guys launched in 2005 ribbon around since 2005 yeah so originally we had looked at the online space and realized there was opportunity to create a new brand for young men at that point the websites for maximum Comedy Central spike were really underwhelming and we thought if we could create a place where there is great content and an attitude and a voice that really resonated with people we'd be able to aggregate a large audience by doing that and I think we're still more or less true to that vision editorially still today so seventy percent I think if you're your viewership is is male between the ages of what 18 and 34 wrote that has to be pretty attractive to advertisers absolutely I think starting with break in 05 we really have done is take our ability to program editorially for them and attract large audiences of guys and try to make it more broadly appeal to advertisers as well by doing it not just in video but also in editorial and whatnot so over the last four years of companies really evolved from being just that one property of Frankcom to a suite of eight properties that reach over 30 million unique visitors a month all still targeting the young male audience so how did advertising hold up then last year I mean people spend their dollars towards higher CPM so maybe giving you more money than then say other allotments in their budget yeah absolutely I think a revenue is up almost 40% last year and i think it was in large part driven by a recognition that we really do understand this young male audience and not only can offer deep integrations across our properties but we also have as we operate the fifth largest video network the opportunity to offer scale and reach and frequency to them from that aspect as well so so advertising is what are your revenue streams what are the other revenue streams advertising is up till now our primary and soul revenue stream every once in a while we actually create and acquire a lot of content with an in-house production group that is actively producing acquiring and licensing user-generated content and then also making a vertical content and we do license that out to other people as well from using television across the world and a small part of the business yeah what are some break media's properties and publishers so the largest site outside of break com is a lifestyle site made man which we started in june of last year we really identified a market niche sort of the details GQ aspects of the print business weren't really being well translated to the internet so we hired a bunch of staff to go and literally create a men's lifestyle site online which is done very well hitting almost two and a half million uniques last month our humorous side holy taco is probably the next largest after that which is really just again young men attitude all humor base and that has about two announcement repeats games entertainment yeah so our other sites are and we have a NASCAR site called all left turns and mixed martial arts site called cage potato entertainment sex called screen junkies we try to do essentially is identify verticals where we think there's both a user and an advertiser opportunity and build 10 pole properties in each of those verticals and then we also partner with other leading publishers in each of those areas to help them monetize it more effectively so is there any interest in going outside of your core audience base or there you know women's sites already out there that are successful the glam sand yeah why not I think from a programming and editorial standpoint there's a lot of people serving other markets but honestly we just do what we do really well from a program editorial standpoint for men I think as we look more at our video network business where because were the fifth largest we do attract a broader audience and our potential reaches much larger and other demos as well there were servicing advertisers who are interested in reaching a different segments of the male audience in particular and also occasionally those who are interested in reaching females again like we have the inventory we have they reach four reach and frequency level but are in general we have a fairly large internal content team makes videos that writes articles that's all young male oriented and that's where the primary bulk of our research about what people want is based on great thanks t thank you
