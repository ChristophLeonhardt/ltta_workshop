President Trump: THE ECONOMY IS SO STRONG AND JOBS ARE SO GOOD THAT I THINK WE'LL SURPRISE. WE WON AN ELECTION YESTERDAY IN ARIZONA. NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT. THEY HAD THESE MASSIVE BOOTHS SET UP FOR CNN AND EVERYBODY. THEY HAD THIS BIG BOOTHS SET UP BECAUSE THEY WERE HOPING THEY SPENT A FORTUNE ON THE DEMOCRAT AND THE REPUBLICAN WON. Rick: PRESIDENT TRUMP DISCUSSING REPUBLICAN DEBBIE LESKO'S VICTORY IN ARIZONA ON FOX NEW YESTERDAY. SHE WON BY A 5% MARGIN. GIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CARRIED THE DISTRICT BY 21 POINTS IN 2016. SHOULD REPUBLICANS BE CONCERNED AS WE APPROACH THE NOVEMBER MID-TERM ELECTIONS. JOINING US NOW IS RONNA McDANIELS, CHAIRWOMAN OF THE RNC. THE CONGRESSWOMAN ELECT SAID A WIN IS A WIN. IT WAS JUST UNDER 5% MARGIN OF VICTORY. IS THAT A STORY HERE? IT'S A HUGE WIN AND LET'S LOOK AT THESE CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL ELECTIONS. WE'VE WON FIVE OUT OF SIX, 100,000 LESS VOTERS TURN OUT THAN IN 2016 FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL AND YOU LOSE INCUMBENTS. THERE ARE OPEN SEATS WITHOUT AN INCUMBENT WHICH ARE ALWAYS MORE COMPETITIVE. TO WIN FIVE OUT OF SIX SHOWS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE DELIVERING. THEY FEEL THE IMPACT OF THESE TAX CUTS. THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP, JOBS ARE COMING BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND I FEEL VERY GOOD GOING INTO THE MID-TERMS. Rick: WITH MARGINS THINNING SOME REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING THEY SHOULD BE ON HIGH ALERT. DON'T LISTEN TO THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WHO HAS A NARRATIVE THEY WANT TO PUSH. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LOWER VOTER TURNOUT COMPARED TO A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR AND LOOK AT THE INCUMBENTS BEING GONE, THESE ARE SPECIAL ELECTIONS FOR A REASON. ON DAYS WHEN PEOPLE TYPICALLY DON'T VOTE. THE FACT WE'RE WINNING TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME SHOWS THAT VOTERS ARE TAKING STOCK OF WHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE IN CONGRESS, WHAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND THEY'RE RETURNING REPUBLICANS TO CONGRESS. Rick: THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE PRESS IS IGNORING THIS WIN AND THAT LEADS TO A BIGGER QUESTION. ARE REPUBLICANS FACING AN UPHILL BATTLE GETTING COVERAGE FOR THEIR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. IT'S SHAMEFUL THE PRESS HASN'T COVERED THIS WIN. IF IT WERE THE OTHER WAY AROUND IT WOULD BE BLANKET COVERAGE DAY AFTER DAY THE BELLWETHER OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER. THEY WERE READY TO DO THAT AND WE WON AND IT'S CRICKETS. THEY DON'T WANT TO SHARE A NARRATIVE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE DELIVERING JUST LIKE THEY DON'T SHARE THE FACTS OF THESE TAX CUTS THAT OVER FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BENEFITED FROM BONUSES OR HIGHER WAGES OR 401K INCREASES, THAT 2/3 OF AMERICANS HAVE BIGGER PAYCHECKS, ECONOMY IS ALL THE GOOD THINGS COMING OUT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS NOT BEING COVERED AT THE LEVEL IT SHOULD BE. GUESS WHAT, THE VOTERS ARE SMART. THEY'RE FIGURING IT OUT AND WHY WE'VE WON FIVE OUT OF SIX SPECIALS HEADING INTO AN IMPORTANT MID-TERM TO KEEP OUR MAJORITIES. Rick: NOW YOU HAVE PEACE IN KOREA AND PERHAPS SOLIDIFY THE BASE. ISIS ON THE RUN. MILITARY BEING FUNDED. AMERICA IS A LEADER IN THE WORLD AND A PRESIDENT DOESN'T BLINK WHEN HE IS CHALLENGED. THAT HAS CHANGED THE DYNAMIC AND HE HAS RESTORED AMERICA AS THE COUNTRY WITH THE BIG STICK. WE AREN'T GOING TO BLINK WHEN YOU CHALLENGE US AND LOOK NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NORTH KOREA. Rick: ARE YOU FACING A DAILY FRUSTRATION TO GET YOUR MESSAGE OUT IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA? I'M NOT. WE KNEW THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WASN'T GOING TO BE OUR FRIEND AND UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED NEGATIVE COVERAGE OF THIS PRESIDENT. THE RNC HAS RAISED DOUBLE THE MONEY AND TRAINED MORE VOLUNTEERS WE DID IN THE 2016 CYCLE. WE ARE ON THE GROUND IN 25 STATES. WE'LL TAKE THE MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS AND GOING TO BYPASS WHAT THEY HEAR IN THE MEDIA. AS WE TAKE THE MESSAGE TO THE VOTERS IT IS RESONATING AND PLEASED WHERE THIS ECONOMY IS AND PROUD OF OUR PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE IS DOING TO CARE ABOUT THAT AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY AND THEY KNOW THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE LOST THEIR WAY. Rick: YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRESIDENT WON THAT DISTRICT BY 21% AND THIS CANDIDATE WON IT BY 5%. YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. 130,000 LESS VOTERS TURNED OUT. YOU CAN'T DO APPLES TO APPLES. IF IT WAS THE SAME TURNOUT AS A PRESIDENTIAL YEAR, FINE. IT IS A MUCH LOWER TURNOUT BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL ELECTION. THE PRESIDENT WOULD WIN THAT
