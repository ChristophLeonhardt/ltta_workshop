ABOUT YOUR STORY FOR A LOT OF

35
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:16,465
YEARS BUT EVEN THEN, FOR ME,

36
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,500
AFTER KNOWING THE STORY AS WELL

37
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,836
AS I DO, I'VE GOT CHILLS DOWN MY

38
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,504
BACK WHEN I HEARD VLADIMIR PUTIN

39
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:23,338
MENTIONED YOUR NAME.

40
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:24,873
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

41
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:26,575
>>  WELL, I SHOULD POINT OUT

42
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:27,743
THAT HE'S BEEN MENTIONING MY

43
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:29,778
NAME ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR THE

44
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:30,813
LAST SIX YEARS.

45
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:33,482
IN FACT I WOULD GO SO FAR AS SO

46
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:34,650
SAY VLADIMIR PUTIN IS OBSESSED

47
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:35,217
WITH ME.

48
00:01:35,218 --> 00:01:36,852
HE'S OBSESSED BECAUSE I WAS THE

49
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:40,355
ONE RESPONSIBLE FORGETTING THE

50
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:44,993
HIS CORRUPTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

51
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:46,261
VIOLATIONS AND HE HATES THAT.

52
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:47,896
MARIA: SO TELL US ABOUT THAT

53
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,667
YOUR STORY AT ONE POINT, ONE OF

54
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,535
THE LEADING INVESTORS IN RUSSIA.

55
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:56,138
YOU OWNED A LOT OF RUSSIAN

56
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,539
COMPANIES, RUSSIAN STOCKS IN

57
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,707

ACTIVE INVESTOR CALLING OUT THIS

60
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,891
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED, BILL?

61
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:18,594
>>  WELL SO AFTER EXPOSING

62
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:20,129
CORRUPTION IN THESE BIG

63
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,130
COMPANIES, PUTIN EXPELLED ME

64
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,298
FROM THE COUNTRY, DECLARED ME AS

65
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,234
A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY.

66
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,703
THE POLICE THEN RAIDED MY

67
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,638
OFFICES IN MOSCOW, SEIZED ALL MY

68
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,807
DOCUMENTS I HAD A YOUNG LAWYER

69
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,742
START TO INVESTIGATE AND HE

70
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:35,677
FIGURED OUT THEY SEIZED THOSE

71
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:37,346
DOCUMENTS TO STEAL $230 MILLION

72
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:41,483
HE EXPOSED IT.

PUTIN HATES ME FOR.

83
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:10,846
MARIA: AND IT BASICALLY PROTECTS

84
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:12,981
COMPANIES AND PUNISHES THOSE WHO

85
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:15,384
TRY TO HAVE FRAUD AND STEALING

86
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,352
OF THE WEALTH BY THE OLIGARCHS

87
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:20,289
AND PUTIN IS UPSET BY THAT.

88
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,758
LET'S SHOW YOU THE WALL STREET

IT BEGINS LIKE THIS, VLADIMIR

94
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:30,999
PUTIN KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS FROM

95
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:34,469
HELP IN SILENCING BUSINESSMAN

96
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,910

00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:45,781

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

101
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,361
DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS SOME

102
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:03,765
OF THE MONEY FROM THE MAGNITSKYN

103
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:04,399
ITSKY CASE IN NEW YORK

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,934

00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:07,569
CASE AGAINST A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH

106
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,804
AND FUSION GPS CAME INTO WORK

107
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:13,508
FOR THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH SO

108
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:20,983
A SMEAR CAMPAIGN ON ME AND THEY

109
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:23,719
PUT TOGETHER ALL OF THE TALKING

110
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,953
POINTS ABOUT ME FOR THE TRUMP

111
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,488
TOWER MEETING WHERE SHE WENT

112
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:28,957
INTO SPEAK WITH DONALD TRUMP JR.

113
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,194
AND I WOULD DEDUCE THAT

114
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:33,629
FUSION GPS AND GLENN SIMPSON

115
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,630
THEREFORE PUT TOGETHER THE SAME

116
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,597
TALKING POINTS FOR VLADIMIR

117
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:36,999
PUTIN BECAUSE THEY WERE THE SAME

118
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:41,970
SO IN THAT HELSINKI MEETING LAST

119
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:42,804
WEEK, VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID A

120
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:44,573
WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF ABOUT ME

121
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:49,211
FROM GLENN SIMPSON.

122
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:50,646
MARIA: WELL THE SENATE VOTED

123
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:52,514
DOWN ANY IDEA THAT RUSSIANS

124
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:54,816
WOULD BE ABLE TO QUESTION YOU

125
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:55,851
AND DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY

126
00:04:55,852 --> 00:04:57,486
AGREED WITH THAT, SO THAT'S NOT

127
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,787
HAPPENING BUT I'VE SEEN SOME OF

128
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,322
YOUR QUOTES IN THE PRESS.

129
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:01,590
YOU'RE AFRAID THAT IF IN FACT

130
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,992
THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, YOU'RE A

131
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:04,359
DEAD MAN.

132
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,861
>>  WELL BASICALLY EVEN IF

133
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:07,596
THERE'S ONLY 1% CHANCE OF IT

134
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:08,930
HAPPENING IF I GET HANDED OVER

135
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,666
TO THE RUSSIANS AND TO VLADIMIR

136
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,534
PUTIN, I WILL BE KILLED, THERE'S

137
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:13,735
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

138
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,103
THEY MADE DEATH THREATS ON A

139
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:16,938
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, A NUMBER OF

140
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,476
ATTEMPTED TO BE KILLED.

141
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:24,813
VLADIMIR PUTIN WANTS ME DEAD.

142
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,982
THIS IS NOT, THIS IS A VERY

143
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:27,516
SERIOUS MATTER.

144
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,551
MARIA: NOW THE CHARGES THAT HE

145
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:31,620
LEVELS AGAINST YOU WHICH WERE

146
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:34,956
ALL DEBUNKED, BUT HE SAYS YOU

147
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:36,491
AVOIDED TAXES IN RUSSIA AND IN

148
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:37,626
THE U.S. AND THAT YOU GAVE

149
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:39,461
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

150
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:40,195
TO HILLARY CLINTON.

151
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:42,264
YOUR REACTION.

152
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,866
>>  WELL, HE'S BEEN THROWING OUT

153
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:46,702
CHARGES AGAINST ME LIKE CANDY.

154
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:48,136
THESE PARTICULAR CHARGES HAVE

155
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:50,472
BEEN ANALYZED BY THE U.S.

156
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:51,406
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, BY

157
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:55,777
BEEN REJECTED.

158
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,113
IT'S JUST COMPLETE NONSENSE.

159
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:03,919
ZERO CONTRIBUTIONS TO HILLARY

160
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,825
CONTRIBUTIONS, AND IN FACT THIS

161
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:16,264
IS ZERO.

162
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:18,400
MARIA: IT'S AN INTERESTING

163
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,167
SITUATION BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK

164
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:20,969
AT THE PAST IN TERMS OF VLADIMIR

165
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,977
THROWN IN JAIL NOT TO MENTION

166
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:31,747
THE ENDLESS NUMBER OF MURDERS OF

167
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:34,282
JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, AND

168
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:36,752
ENEMIES OF PUTIN.

169
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:39,621
THEN AGAIN, RUSSIA AND THE U.S.

170
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,189
CONTROL 90% OF THE WORLD'S

171
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,391
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.

172
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,894
WHAT DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP DO?

173
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:48,997
HE HAS TO WORK WITH THE OTHER

174
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:51,767
PARTNER OF THE NUCLEAR

175
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:52,567
CAPABILITY, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT

176
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:54,302
TO PUT A PICTURE TOGETHER OF WHO

177
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,238
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS.

178
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,140
>>  WELL I THINK THAT PRESIDENT

179
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,976
TRUMP SHOULD DO IT WHAT RONALD

180
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:02,377
REGAN DID.

181
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,813
I MEAN, RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET

182
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,748
UNION HAVE HAD THESE NUCLEAR WAR

183
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:07,749
HEADS FOR A LONG TIME.

184
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:12,654
UNION AND DONALD TRUMP SHOULD

185
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:13,455
CONTAIN RUSSIA.

186
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:14,990
THIS IS NOT, YOU DON'T MAKE

187
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:17,426
