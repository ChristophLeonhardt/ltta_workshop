♪ ♪ Bret: FINALLY TONIGHT "NOTABLE QUOTABLES" CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER STYLE. LET ME GIVE A PIECE OF ADVICE. WHEN THERE IS A SUIT BETWEEN THE STATE OF OBAMA AGAINST THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR, TAKE THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE OF THE POOR. I HAVE A SOFT SPOT. IT COULD BE BECAUSE I WAS IN MY YOUTH A LIBERAL. I RETAIN THE MARSHMALLOW DEEP INSIDE MY HEART. THE PITY IS THIS. THIS IS THE STRONGEST FIELD OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES AND INSTEAD ALL OUR TIME IS SPENT DISCUSSING THIS RODEO CLOWN. I'M THE BEST PRESIDENT I HAVE EVER BEEN? THAT IS A PRETTY LOW BAR. THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU LIVE IN A BANANA REPUBLIC. EVERY TIME LIBERALS LOSE THEY ACCUSE THE OTHER SIDE OF ALL KIND OF ISMS. THE WORLD IS GOING TO HELL IN A HAND BASKET. IT WILL SNOW IN HELL BEFORE THE D.O.J. IS GOING TO GO AFTER HER. HIDE SEAN SPICER, WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM SOMEWHERE IN IOWA I THINK WOULD HELP. AND TAKE AWAY THE PRESIDENT'S TWEETING MACHINE. LOSER BY FAR, MELISSA McCARTHY. SHE LOST OLD SPICEY. SHE WILL MISS HIM. SHE DIDN'T JUST LOSE A GUY. SHE KILLED HIM. Bret: YOU OFFICIALLY ARE PUTTING A BLACK CHIP NOW ON DONALD TRUMP ON CANDIDATE CASINO. I PUT $100 ON MONDAY. I LEFT $10 SO I CAN GET REALLY DRUNK. Bret: YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH WINE, WOMEN AND SONG, OPIOIDS. I STARTED A TREND. THE OTHER ONLY OPTION IS AN ACT OF GOD. AND HE APPEARS TO BE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED RIGHT NOW. Martha: SURE YOU TUNE IN TONIGHT. Bret: OR SET THE D.V.R. FOR 9:00 SPECIAL EVENT. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER IN HIS OWN
