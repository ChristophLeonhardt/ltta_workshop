what would you attribute the rising tribalism to yeah so the way that I think about what's happened to our country is that in a large secular society there are a lot of forces blowing us apart and they're a lot pulling us together and if you go back to the mid to late 20th century everything was lined up to pull us together we'd had extraordinarily high rates of immigration in the late 19th and early 20th century that's when my grandparents came over from Russia and Poland there was a big wave of anti-immigrant backlash and in the 20s the gates were shut immigration went way down and as you say immigration has many good effects and many bad effects yet you have to look at it honestly and try to maximize the good so we had by the 70s and 80s we had very low rates of foreign-born there was a dominant culture it was the wasp culture David Brooks has written brilliantly about how the wasps set up a meritocracy within which Jews and Asians and other groups were able to succeed we had a common enemy still in the Soviet Union we had a functioning political culture in Washington where there's a lot of bipartisanship Oh in the media system there were three networks and so there was a more common common sources of news so all those things were lined up and this was the center of American greatness and all over the world people look to America and they said wow we want what they've got let's copy their constitution let's copy their culture we were the light of the world obviously that's plenty of anti-americanism too but there's a lot of admiration for us and then one by one the the centrifugal force is pulling us together began to weaken the immediate environment obviously reversed beginning with cable TV all the way through to social media now it's fractionating us the obviously immigration greatly increased beginning of the 60s and again many good things The Economist's or clear immigration is good economically but as you say the issues of social trust and cohesion Robert putnams work and others suggest that that that drops trust in others drops and to have a functioning democracy it really helps to have cross group trust to not be suspicious of each other so in so many ways things have kind of turned around and we have to do some serious thinking what is it going to take to restore the the social supports for a active democracy
