the Mueller investigation into Trump Russia collusion is taking serious fire the Democrats are on the ropes after their failed government shutdown and the NFL makes a giant boo-boo leading up to the Super Bowl I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show we have tons to get to today and tomorrow I will be speaking at University of Connecticut where of course naturally the administration has decided that I am a threat to public safety and they've decided that the general public will not be allowed to attend it will be students only at University of Connecticut this is the second school in a row they've done this over Berkeley they did this and now they're doing at University of Connecticut as well even though we likely would have had thousands of people who wanted to show up it's getting very irritating for me we'll discuss that a little bit later the uu count by the way is actually acknowledging that I am not the one who promotes the violence they are saying that they don't see me offending the audience they don't see me coming there to tick off the audience so at least they're acknowledging that but doesn't really change any of that we'll get to all of that we will also get to these bombshell text messages inside the FBI regarding the Mueller investigation what comes next on the government shutdown and daca but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so just a couple of weeks ago you remember there was a false alarm in Hawaii when everyone in the state of Hawaii thought that they were going to be nuked into the ground by North Korea and if that got you thinking hey what would happen if god forbid they were actually disaster to that magnitude first of all it's important to note just because I'm not gonna get graphic every just because the nuclear weapon would fall on your city does not necessarily mean that you will die right the fact is that nuclear weapons actually do not look like Terminator 2 they don't wipe out entire cities instead nuclear weapons affect a certain area if you're living outside that area however you are going to still be living without food without water unless you go to my Patriots supply this is not just true obviously in the unlikely event of a nuclear catastrophe it's also true for natural disasters which have been happening relatively frequently and you see on the news all these people who don't have food and they don't have water that's why you need to go to my Patriots apply they're the experts in self-reliance get their 102 servings survival food kit it lasts up to 25 years in

cooking check it out 888 803 1413 prepare with been calm ok so we so we begin with today's we begin with today's big news and that is these bombshell text messages that are now coming out from the FBI so the FBI has turned over a bunch of text messages to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the and the House Judiciary Committee and these text messages are not looking good for the FBI so first off Bob Goodlatte who is Republican from Virginia and Devon Nunez Republican from California as well as trey gowdy Republican of South Carolina issued a statement on text messages they received regarding top FBI officials they requested all of the backlog to text messages and here's what they say quote this weekend we met to discuss the text messages and possible next steps in our oversight of these agencies the contents of these text messages between top FBI officials are extremely troubling in terms of when key decisions were made by the Department of Justice and the FBI by whom these decisions were made and the evident bias exhibited by those in charge of the investigation the omission of text messages between December 2016 and May 2017 a critical gap encompassing the FBI's Russia investigation is equally concerning rather than clearing up prior FBI and DOJ actions these recently produced documents cause us to further question the credibility and objectivity of certain officials at the FBI so as we mentioned yesterday on the show there are a couple of big stories that have come out of the FBI the first is that there are these text messages that were sent between members of the FBI regarding the way the Mueller investigation was run the second is that hundreds of text messages apparently have gone missing among thousands of text messages that have gone missing hundreds between Louisa page who was working on Mueller investigation and her paramour Peter is struck who's also working on Mueller investigation was a top counterintelligence guy yesterday on Facebook live you should check it out in our Facebook page we had the opportunity to talk with representative Jim Jordan Republican from Ohio who's overseeing a lot of the stuff he's on the Oversight Committee and and representative Jordan was talking about the fact that they need a second independent Council to investigate the first independent council because this investigation is is compromised already I did ask him a couple of the questions I've asked on the show why doesn't the President of the United States simply declassify the FISA warrant that was taken out against her page so we can find out whether any the FBI was using bad Intel to target President Obama's and Hillary Clinton's political enemies he suggested that perhaps Trump didn't want to politicize the issue I find that unconvincing nonetheless the fact is that there is an in the the release the memo crew they remember there was a memo last week that we were talking about that supposedly lays out all of the flaws in FISA supposedly lays out all the problems with the FBI this memo will be released to the public in the next one to two weeks we are now hearing so we'll have more information at that point meanwhile according to attorney general Jeff Sessions this is reported over at Gateway pundit which is sometimes inaccurate but here it is apparently accurate they have 50,000 text messages that were exchanged between Peter struck and his mistress Lisa page I don't think that statistic is correct I think 50,000 text messages were missing some of those were from a struck to page but foxy well here's what Fox News says so let me get this right I don't want to say something is not true that's not true it says more than 50 thousand texts were exchanged between two FBI officials who have come under fire for exchanging anti-trump text messages during the 2016 election attorney general jeff sessions revealed monday the figure surfaced as lawmakers have been pressing for answers about after revelations that the FBI failed to preserve five months of text between Peter struck and Lisa page Jeff session said we'll leave no stone unturned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now are not now available to be produced and we will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source I have to say the number of documents that have gone missing whether it's Hillary Clinton's email servers or whether it is the FBI is suddenly losing tens of thousands of texts pretty shocking stuff the FBI servers included over 50,000 texts and apparently the FBI system failed to retain text messages for approximately five months between December 14 2017 and May 17 2007 teen as I suggested these dates are particularly suspicious because May 17th 2017 is when is literally the date that Robert Mueller took over the investigation and then apparently there's more so John Ratcliffe who is a Republican from Texas he said after reviewing the text messages that he thinks there was a quote unquote secret society of folks within the DOJ and FBI working against a Trump here's what the Federalist reports quote trey Gowdy said the explanation for the missing text may be fishier than the official explanation he says he saw struck and page discussing getting rid of texts in a printout of the messages he and other members of Congress received last week well lay that lay aside this glaring five-month gap in text that the world's premier agency somehow missed Gowdy said what Johnny and I saw today was a text about not keeping texts we saw more manifest bias against President Trump all the way through the election into the transition Ratcliffe said it is a strange coincidence it is possible that these messages that were missing perhaps it is a strange coincidence and then Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin he went even further he said in a radio interview on Tuesday with Jay Weber at WISN in Milwaukee he read aloud a May 19th 2017 tax rates this would be two days after they suddenly magically recovered texts in this text apparently he wrote quote there's two lisa page his mistress you and i both know the odds are nothing about whether this investigation is going to turn up something and I thought it was likely I'd be there no question I hesitated in part because of my gut sense and concerned there's no big there there he said he didn't actually want to join the Mueller investigation because he didn't think there was anything actually going on Johnson said I think that's kind of jaw-dropping he said in other words Peter struck who was the FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division the man who had a plan to do something because he just couldn't abide Donald Trump being president he's saying that his gut sense that there's no big there there when it comes to the Mueller Special Counsel investigation now I will say that it does seem like there's a conflict between this text and the implication that struck was basically ginning up a fake investigation in order to get Trump right suggests there was something else going on inside the FBI but not the Trump collusion investigation not the Mueller investigation because if indeed struck was texting his paramour Lisa page and suggesting hey Lisa there's nothing here and I don't want to join the investigation about Trump Russia collusion because I don't think there's anything there then that does pose a different point of view than the suggestion that he was trying to craft out of whole cloth this narrative that Trump was colluding with Russia and then shoved that down the throats of people over at the FBI in other words there's a lot of there's a lot of confusion going on here they're certainly gonna have to have struck texts of testify they're gonna have to have Lisa page testify I do find it highly suspicious that the FBI is saying these messages just went missing again if you are working for the government and messages just go missing that is that is really suspicious you're not allowed to delete government messages this way I did get a note away from somebody who's an expert on cybersecurity who said that it's very unlikely these messages are gone forever they said the FBI is required to conform to NIS TSP 834 contingency planning guide for federal information systems which requires multiple layers of redundancy and backup these federal continuity and contingency guidelines are designed to assure that systems and data survive multiple natural disasters and 911 types of events it is not possible for a singular glitch to cause the data to be lost that means that if the data were lost then there'd have to be some sort of organized effort is the is the suggestion here so if that is indeed the case then there's a lot more than meets the eye here in any case all of this is disturbing all of it requires investigation I'm not going to buy into the complete Republican narrative that the that this was all set up from the very beginning and that it was based on bad Intel him that it was created out of whole cloth by Hillary Clinton Barack Obama in order to get Donald Trump I don't know what the evidence is there for that I will say however that something smells fishy here with the missing text and with the text about a secret society and all of the rest of this it's all it's all confusing and it requires a lot of exploitation okay so in just a second I want to talk about the the fallout from the government shutdown that failed for Democrats first I want to say thank you

well there's all this fallout surrounding the Muller investigation there's also fallout surrounding the Democrats completely blowing it on the government shutdown one of the things that is absolutely hilarious is joy Reid over at MSNBC said that the government shutdown was actually not a loss for Democrats she is incorrect it is in fact a very large loss for Democrats they got nothing in return and looked like cowards they basically they they look like brave Sir Robin ran away they stood there and they said that they were going to to fight to the end the end lasted approximately 69 hours and then out they were they were done so Chuck Schumer tried to pretend that he had won a big victory yesterday when he announced the end of the government shutdown needless to say this was untrue the Republican leader and I have come to an arrangement we will vote today to reopen the government to continue notion negotiating a global agreement with the commitment that if an agreement isn't reached by February the 8th the Senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with daca ok we'll only one problem the White House has immediately announced that they are not going to push for any of the any of the proposals that the Democrats would want here so for example White House spokesperson holds a Hogan Gidley he said that Graham's urban which is the bill that Schumer wants this is the bill that will give two billion dollars for the border wall but nothing else in exchange for keeping 800,000 dreamers and their parents here the White House spokesperson said that's not on the table so while Chuck Schumer is saying we want a big victory here the answer is no they really did in this clip six senator Graham and Senator Durbin were completely dishonest when they brought the plan to the president it did not do anything to address chain migration in fact it blew it up and made it bigger it gave basically amnesty those two have been in lockstep on immigration for decades they want open borders they want amnesty that's what Lindsey Graham is about I'm from South Carolina I've known the man for a long time and it's fine he can take that position but to pretend he's anything other than someone who wants open borders in amnesty it's just disingenuous so the White House is taking a very strong stance at least publicly on immigration which means the Democrats gained nothing they didn't even gain any sort of and anything here in the bargain right debbie Wasserman Schultz was asked about this the former head of the DNC she was asked by Brianna Keller on on CNN what exactly did you gain through all of this and and debbie Wasserman Schultz head I mean nothing there's literally nothing what one thing did he get you know from Republicans to justify shutting down the government in the first place so so the one thing I would say that he did get is the potential for momentum because if and I'm certainly hopeful that then maybe a one-story position I'm still hung up that when I know Americans are listening and they heard you say it's reverberating potential for momentum and they're thinking for momentum was that really worth shutting the government down for what tential for something I will tell you that Republicans should be asking themselves that question because they shut the government down okay again of both ways either you shut the government down relation at the government down it's not that they shut the government down and we gained momentum by them shutting the government down you shut the government down and then you admitted you shut the government down and Chuck Schumer admitted you shut the government down I do love that this is like emanations from penumbra's in in terms of meaningless phrases potential for momentum is pretty spectacular you know it has potential for momentum this cup sitting right here it has potential for momentum but in order for it to have momentum I actually have to generate some force into the cup right this is the thing about momentum it has to be generated by a certain amount of force okay initially momentum doesn't just happen this is called inertia potential for momentum is literally any object this microphone has potential for momentum if I would take it and throw it right now potential for momentum it means nothing okay that the it's literally a meaningless phrase potential for momentum so this is what they gain other Democrats are ripping Chuck Shumer up and down there is a gap that is opening wide inside the Democratic Party it's kind of fascinating it's reflective of the same gap that opened inside the Republican Party in 2013 after the government shutdown there there are a lot of people in the Republican side who said you're not fighting Barack Obama hard enough you need to shut down the government you need to stop the funding of Obamacare because once it's in place it's gonna be very difficult for us ever to to remove it and there is a gap that opened up this is really where I think a lot of the the anger at Mitch McConnell started was the feeling that that he was not fighting hard enough on all of these particular matters and what that led to was such discontent in the Republican Party that Donald Trump was able to waltz through the front door and simply take over the party you're seeing the same thing in the Democratic Party there's a fight now between the so-called establishment wing of the Democratic Party led by Chuck Schumer and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party all the people who are run in 2020 are now basically doing what Ted Cruz did in 2013 right Cruz wanted to run for president in 2016 and so he shut down the government and I like senator Cruz I don't think that it was completely a political ploy by Cruz I think that he felt he was doing what he had to do but there's no question that he had his eye on the presidential race in 2016 the Democrats are doing the same thing now now they're all posturing by saying were the ones who really stood tough Chuck Schumer didn't stand tough all the people in the Senate who want to run for president are being very clear about what they want to do here Chris Coons from Delaware he basically was trying to encourage all these 2020 contenders guys simmer now shut up like Ken what can we actually govern well here are you guys just gonna run for president what appeals to our base for some primary several years from now is not what I'm worried about what I'm worried about is how do we solve real problems and my gut is that at the end of the day that's what people are looking for in a next national leader as well so for my colleagues who are hoping that they might be on the ticket in 2020 I don't think simply moving further and further to the left is the best way to accomplish that I think showing we can solve big problems is the way to encourage people to believe that Democrats belong in control of the Congress and back in the white house but this is what's so fascinating is that the the Democrats who want to win are now opposed to the Democrats who are radical right well we're seeing now is that the Democrats are moving farther and further to the left this is what's amazing is it the recommend studying since 2010 Republicans have been stagnant the Democratic Party however continues to move further and further to the left and Trump has prompted them to move even further to the left because their hatred of Trump means knee-jerk opposition to anything he does including funding things like the children's health insurance program by the way funny to note remember one like two days ago Jimmy Kimmel was complaining that the Republicans wouldn't fund chip oh the Republicans are holding chip hostage oh the Republicans won't fund the children's health insurance program oh they're evil oh they're terrible the Republicans just funded chip for another six years did Jimmy Kimmel have anything to say about that last night on his show no no there's a giant shock because he's taking all of his cues from Chuck Schumer but again the gap in the Democratic Party is open and widening Nancy Pelosi was trying to prevent it from widening still further she came out yesterday and she said I think that it was a mistake for us not to continue the government shutdown but then she tried to spend this all as Trump small they're gonna try and go back to the well and use Trump as their unifying force what I think the main obstacle is if I may is this there's a dark cloud hanging over the capital and that dark cloud is the Trump tax scam that took nearly two trillion dollars and and added it to the deficit when you take the cost and the and the interest on the debt two trillion dollars so therefore the impact on on members only Republican side voting for more domestic investments is diminished Oh like hit like Democrats care at all about deficits come on when's the last time Democrats gave to dams about a deficit that's that's ridiculous but you know she's trying to shift blame off of Schumer as well she should the only person who's honest about this that I saw completely honest was luis Gutierrez the Democrat from Illinois who is very hardcore and immigration and who was perfectly willing to shut down the government over all of this because this is his lead issue he says listen my Democratic colleagues they blink they lost I think they cave they blinked they're you know most of my Democrats are good at articulating their values and and how enthusiastically they support their values sometimes they're not as strong and so she is defending them in the legislative process so there we are the Democrats I think are going to be slugging this one out for at least a little while to come yeah if they win the house in in 2018 then it is possible that all of this comes to an end victory tends to bring parties together loss tends to divide parties this is obviously the case with the Democrats who run literally zero branches of government at this point one of the things that's been fascinating is that not only on Republicans gaining in the polls but if you look at the way that the districts run Democrats have a bit of an uphill run a lot of the districts have become a lot more partisan and polarized so Democrats would basically have to have a wave in order to take over the house I've been suggesting for a while I think they probably will take over the house but I don't think that it's gonna be any surefire bet especially the way the Democrats are blowing it this government shutdown does not help them it gives the impression that they're not competent and the truth is they aren't they decided to blackmail the Republicans they put a gun to their own head and decide to blackmail the Republicans it was the scene from Blazing Saddles where where the black sheriff puts the gun to his own head and says and they're trying to hang him and he says don't hang me they put the gun to his own head he says don't hang me or the bleep gets it right and that's how they go no no don't do it don't do it the Democrats thought that strategy was actually going to work here that strategy obviously did not work here they blink they look bad and now we're running up on February 8th there's gonna be another government shutdown but Democrats have no leverage here and that brings up the question as to what comes next because the Republicans have basically said we're gonna try and handle daca before February 8th that day is quickly approaching it's already January 23rd so that means that were basically two weeks out but we'll get to that in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at filter by so the holidays might be over but the winter is in full swing and that means that you're spending a lot more time indoors well according to studies the air indoors contains up to 100 times more pollution than the air outside which can cause illness allergies unnecessary wear and tear on your HVAC system or even the premature replacement of the entire system if you don't replace it your filters that's why you need filter by they carry over 600 different filter sizes including custom options all shipped free within 24 hours they're manufactured right here in the United States we've used it at our house it's the easiest thing in the world you just go on your side on their site and you choose which you want and not only that they also offer in automatic programs there's auto delivery so every time every few months they send you the the air filters that you need you never have to think about it again you never have to oh well I wouldn't last time I change the filter I guess must have been two years ago that's not gonna happen to you anymore they offer a multitude of whom ME RV options all the way up to hospital grade so you'll be removing dangerous pollen mold dust other allergy aggravating pollution while maximizing the efficiency of your system and right now you save five percent when you set up auto delivery so you never need to think about those air filters again it's filter by comm filter bu why coming and that's filter by comm and you save five percent when you set up auto delivery so you never need to think about those air filters again filter bu why.com filter by comm all right so what comes next on data that of course is the next step the Democrats suggest that they have the potential for momentum that they are finally going to be moving forward and the the answer is not so much because I mentioned the White House is making clear that they don't want to cave to Democrats and they honestly have no interesting having two Democrats let's play this out let's say no deal gets done well get to February 8th the Democrats are not going to shut down the government again so we'll get another funding bill it won't include daca and then we'll get to March and the Democrats by the way have no interest in actually saving Trump from having to back down but Trump could easily just say listen we're not gonna fix Jaca right we're not gonna be issuing any new any new deck of permits but we're also not going to start deporting people right we're just gonna let people stay here we'll go after the the criminal illegal aliens first if he says that then nothing really happens is the urgency here this is the thing about all of us that makes no sense the urgency here is a little bit overblown by the President of the United States can just continue to wait daca the same way that the the former president of the United States has right there the the the fact that the fact that Jack guy is coming to an end on March 8 doesn't mean that mass and that massive deportations are about to happen the deadline just means that they're not gonna be issuing any more new papers for people who have been trying to who've been trying to get papers to stay in the country permanently sorry - a March 5th is the date that they're looking at actually right so the idea that that the world ends on March 5th unless they come to some sort of deal obviously is not true right obviously it's just not so that means that there's not a lot of pressure on Trump to come to a deal and it's not a lot of pressure on Democrats to come to the deal right here's what we know right there the March 5th deadline ends protections for young undocumented immigrants if Congress fails to do anything but the Homeland Security Secretary is already saying that they're not gonna do anything about this but the White House is sort of making hints because they have to right they're trying to push Democrats into making a deal but Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that you know maybe they'll start supporting three murders probably not said we haven't determined that we're hopeful we don't have to do that we don't have to get there we'd like Democrats to get serious about solving problems the suggestion being that if we reach this deadline and nothing happens then Trump could just say you know what a little more time for negotiation I'm not gonna deport people that's the most likely outcome of all of this right not that he starts mass deportations the way that Ann Coulter would like but then he actually doesn't do any of that so both sides have an interest in reaching a deal but both sides also have an interest in not reaching a deal which means that this will probably drag on beyond the deadline the the idea of a quick deadline by February 8th is not gonna happen and the proof is in the pudding Chuck Schumer is already taken off the table offers that he had already made right so Chuck Schumer is taking his big spending boost for the border wall off the table according to Politico this happened in the last few minutes the Senate Minority Leader through an aide informed the White House on Monday he was retracting the offer he made last week to give Trump well north of 1.6 billion dollars in wall funding Trump had asked for this year according to two Democrats now they say Trump will simply not get a better deal than that on his signature campaign promise so Schumer offered a large increase in border while spending as a condition for a broader deal to help dreamers after that offer was rebuffed prompting the shutdown the president has missed the opportunity to get the wall said one Democratic aid the Senator Jeff Flake had already considered using the promise of border wall funding totaling more than 1.6 billion dollars in order to lure more conservative votes a dreamer plan written by a bipartisan group of six senators had included Trump's 1.6 billion dollar request as part of a broader 2.7 billion dollar border security package but the White House had already rejected that deal so basically Schumer is withdrawing from a deal at the White House was never going to make so the Democrats have no interest in coming to the table and offering anything they would like to see mass deportations here's the dirty little secret Democrats want Trump to do a mass deportation so they can get all the headlines about how mean and cruel Republicans are leading up to the midterms and Republicans have no interest in surrendering on daca because they want to get their base out for the midterms so my prediction no deal happens here so all the talk about how you know we have to reach a deal we have to reach a deal it's not gonna happen Tim Kaine senator from from Virginia former vice presidential candidate he said we all want a permanent fix right everyone Democrats Republicans we all want a permanent fix they're lying none of them do all of us in the room felt the same way so we we're you know sitting around in Susan's office again and again and then we're dispatching and going talking to the leaders and then coming back and doing the same thing shuttle diplomacy so we do have a strong degree of trust in each other that we want this outcome of opening the government and finding a permanent protection for dreamers everybody in that room said we got to find permanent protection for dreamers and that's really important um the idea that they're going to actually move forward with something again I find highly unlikely they don't have the votes for it in the Senate Democrats are saying to trump you can't just yell about what you want but the truth is that they basically can't ari Melbourne at MSNBC was trying to pressure Trump obviously this is not going to work mr. president here's the deal right now you set a deadline for when you'd start deporting children unless Congress acted then you said you had a deal with Congress then you blew up that deal if you make a deal and don't stick to it long enough to sign it you will push people to find other ways to try to force your hand and since this is a democracy not a dictatorship or a scripted reality show you won't always have the final say by yourself even when you have the top job you don't get to skip the hard part because you only run a co-equal branch of government which of course was recently shut down you can't just yell what you want or go home well actually it's exactly what he can do and he just did it and the Democrats caved so the fact is that's exactly what he will do and again I think the chances of reaching a deal here when Democrats are not bending at all is extraordinarily low right here is Senator mazie Hirono from Hawaii she said listen the funding for the wall is off the table we're not gonna do that so he's saying Melbourne is saying Trump can't just shout what he wants and then go home but that's exactly what Democrats are doing Democrats are shouting what they want and then going home you almost interrupted me when I was talking about Senator Schumer giving the money for the wall to the president is that as it has that changed oh of course the wall is no longer something that you know the Chuck Shumer who was willing to put the wall on the tape if we got a full dacha and full of dreamers and that's not happening so that's off the table what if you it's what if there's an offer for dacha but that has to go back on the table is the wall funding gonna go back on the table at some point I think we're going to have a full-throated debate Dhaka and possibly on a lot of other aspects of comprehensive immigration reform and I know where I'm coming from that we need to keep our focus on the urgency of taking care of the daca dreamers and also comprehensive immigration reform that maintains family unity they're just gonna muddle through this yeah they're just gonna muddle through here's the reality Republicans would like to make a deal on daca they would they'd like to make a deal that also includes border security Democrats don't want any deal that ends illegal immigration they don't they want another wave of illegal immigrants coming through and that's because for both humanitarian reasons and also because they believe that these are all future Democratic voters they would like the border to remain open because this is a simple deal when you ask the common American just the normal American what do you want on immigration the monaural American by the polls it shows that the vast majority of Americans would like to see some sort of legal status for the dreamers it also shows the vast majority of Americans would like to see an increased border security presence as well as and ends the diversity Visa Lottery and chain migration right there is a deal on the table Democrats don't want that deal so there will be no deal I think that there's a good shot that Republicans should actually try and cut that deal themselves and just and just invoke the nuclear option if they have to in order to do it because otherwise Democrats are gonna continue using this as a club to be it Republicans with over and over and over again this issues not gonna get resolved because no one has an interest in watching this issue gets resolved unfortunately even though they're all lying about it to you okay so I want to talk a little bit about the schoolmarm in media as well as the NFL blowing itself up right before the

conservative podcast in the nation so with all of this happening now president Trump's approval rating has continued to be in the dumps which just shows you that his personal toxicity that does not it does not work well for him even though a lot of his base may like it the reason I say this is because there's a poll out today that shows Trump matched up against various Democrats and it does not look particularly good for president from now do these polls mean anything not particularly because in the end you end up running against a candidate you know and when you run against Ted Kennedy you drag them down in the mud at this time in 2015 or 2013 rather you were looking at Donald Trump wasn't even on the polls right now he's the president of United States but if you look at the polls right now Joe Biden in 57% Trump at 40 ye but Sanders at 55 Trump at 42 and Oprah Winfrey at 51 Trump 42 that last one is the most fascinating of the three but it suggested that the Democratic upswell for Oprah Winfrey that Oprah Winfrey is gonna be the next candidate of the future she's barely breaking 50% Joe Biden of course is cleaning the floor with Trump that makes sense he's an established politician he's also somebody with with a blue blue collar appeal apparently and and Bernie Sanders of course is highly popular until he actually has to face up with Trump this doesn't mean of course that Trump would actually lose to these people take all of those statistics with a grain of salt but the fact is that Trump's personal toxicity is driving down numbers for president Trump and for Republicans what is what is providing a lift for Trump and for Republicans is the continued media malfeasance so the fact is the economy right now is very good on foreign policy the situation is looking a lot better than anyone thought it would a year ago with Isis in full-scale retreat Russia basically boxed in and North Korea for all of the talk about it is is still in relatively contained position even though they continue to fire missiles they have no intention of going to war with anyone as far as I can tell the media however continued to lie to people and the more the media do this the media basically become Hollywood right Hollywood in the media who basically be they they've merged whatever the media say whenever they offer their opinion whenever they get involved in the kind of schoolmarm of President Trump people react badly to that Chris Cuomo was responsible for it yesterday he had on Kellyanne Conway and who's slapping Kellyanne Conway for defending president Trump's tweets during the women's March was marched from tweeted out that he was happy that these women were marching and also by the way the economy is great which seems like a fine tweet to me but here's chris cuomo going after Kellyanne Conway what are you talking about I think the people who were marching on Saturday would disagree the women's March the one where the president was tweeting that all the people are out there marching to say how great he's done no no how great the economy is we have the lowest unemployment rate for women in seven no that's not why they were marching it's not insulting to all those women out there who are looking for leadership and looking for someone to get behind them and the city makes a joke out of their March it's no joke that the women's unemployment rate is the lowest in 17 years it is no joke that over a half a million new women enter the workforce in his watch and it's no joke that they don't get equal pay and women like you have been forced to do it twice as hard as men to get to the same place mansplain as so Chris Cuomo demands splitting a Kellyanne Conway about the fake gender gap which is just entertaining as all hell and then people wonder why Trump continues to win when he just says that the economy is good and Chris Cuomo loses his ever-loving mind speaking of media malfeasance so the NFL has seen its ratings to climb dramatically this year I mean they said they've had a serious hit in terms of their of their public image people don't like the NFL nearly as much as they used to I think there are a couple of things behind that one is every time somebody gets hit in the head we immediately think this guy is going to suffer serious brain damage future in the future and that's that's a problem but beyond that it did not help the NFL that their entire image has now been plastered with the people kneeling from the national anthem it got worse okay then the American and veterans group this American veterans group AMVETS tried to take out an ad for the Super Bowl and that ad was it was an ad featuring servicemembers saluting Old Glory as well as their response to the take any message right so here is what the ad looks like you can actually is this video it's just it's just a graphic it's just a graphic so what you can see is is these these soldiers standing with the flag and then it just says make a $20 tax-deductible donation and help us help veterans by texting veterans two four four four nine nine nine and then it's just his hashtag please stand which is seeming seems to be respectful to me so they wanted to take out that ad instead the the NFL said no so the AMVETS a national commander Marian Polk said freedom of speech works both ways to respect the rights of those who choose to protest as these rights are precisely what our members have fought and in many case died for but imposing corporate censorship to deny that same right to those veterans who have secured it for us all is reprehensible and totally beyond the pale so this was supposed to be a 30,000 dollar ad the apparently the NFL vice president of communications told the army Times that the league asked them to change the message to please stand for our veterans but the group was unable to make changes in time for the deadline instead the NFL is running a similar ad apparently from the Veterans of Foreign Wars with the message we stand for veterans the NFL has for spent two years allowing players to sit kneel raise a fist perform other symbolic acts during the performance of the star-spangled banner and it's not true by the way the Superbowl gets rid of politically charged as they had a couple of them let just last year of course man I remember that that they did in an audio ad we made fun of it on the show titled daughter all about how your daughter is gonna be discriminated against but at least she'll be able to drive an Audi I remember that from last year and then there are a couple of ads last year having to do with the illegal immigration also in the middle of the election cycle so rejecting an ad that says please stand because they want to say stand for veterans I don't understand why you can't have an ad that just to stand for the flag or stand for the anthem like it's vague it says please stand obviously it's referring to the anthem and the flag the reason you stand for the vets is because the vets stand for the flag and for the anthem these things are related but this just demonstrates how the people in the media misunderstand the people they are catering to the people who actually watch the NFL stand for the flag and there's a reason that President Trump when he attended the college football championship game was actually cheered by the crowd the fact is that people who watch football are more likely to be in favor of standing for the flag than the average member of the population people watch football skew male excuse rural instead of urban and the fact is and I'm not talking about black versus white I'm just talking about population centers on the coast particularly versus the middle of the country the ratings are higher in the middle of the country from what I understand all of this being the case it is absolute foolishness for the NFL to continue alienating its own viewing population but this is what Hollywood tends to do remember the NFL's part of the entertainment complex and the entertainment complex is mostly interested in pleasing people who live inside the entertainment complex they don't want to tick off their own players by running this ad so which I would suggest better to have the the better to have the audience tick off the players and have the players tick off the audience I mean then the NFL's got enough hits that it's taking right now that the last thing that it needs is to harm itself further by rejecting ads from from veterans that are simply saying stand for the flag well what absolute silliness ok so I want to do a couple things I like and then some things I hate and then we will deconstruct the culture a little bit so let's just jump right into things I like so things I like will begin with dune so been doing a little bit of sci-fi and fantasy this week I did Brandon Sanderson yesterday this of course one of the great classics of the sci-fi genre dune by Frank Herbert it is a very very good book it really reads the movie is awful the original movie of dune I believe they're making a new version aren't they I think they're doing a new version the whole premise of dune if I recall it's been a year since I've read it but the whole premise of dune is that there's a planet that basically has no water on it and and there is a it's a desert planet and it's the only source of a particular spice and so the entire commerce of the planet runs off this particular spice and it's all about you know the enslavement of particular populations and rebellions and it's in declining empires it's really interesting it's a really fascinating book and it is a world-building book right is it is a book that is that is built on the it's a it's a book that is built on the building of an entire galaxy essentially so it's it's worth rating I wish I remembered more about it I could recommend it more highly but it is worth checking out okay other things that I like so megan kelly did something that's just wonderful so Megan I think at NBC News I like Megan I'm friendly with Megan I think that her best attribute as a as a journalist as an interviewer is that she is willing to take no guff from anyone I wish she would do that more an NBC whenever she doesn't on NBC it's really good when she does the sort of soft talk we're gonna talk about what we're doing with her name today's stuff I don't think that's Megan her best I think Megan and her best is this right Megan really is great at this so she had Jane Fonda on the show and Jane and she asked Jane Fonda about plastic surgery which again in a normal interview I don't see the problem with that like I think it's realistic to ask a woman of Jane Fonda's age how she looks like that and what she would do to recommend plastic surgery would you recommend it would she not Jane Fonda apparently got very offended by the so megyn kelly just took her to the woodshed it's brutal look I gave her the chance to empower other women young and old on a subject which she purports to know well and she rejected it that's okay but I have no regrets about that question nor am i in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate after all this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam War many of our veterans attempted to shame American troops she posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our American pilots she called our POWs hypocrites and liars and referred to their torture as understandable even she had to apologize years later for that gun picture but not for the rest of it by the way she still says she is not proud of America okay boom so I think the message here is do not cross megyn kelly when it comes to plastic surgery questions because I worry she basically just takes a brick out of her back pocket and clocks Jane Fonda across that it's been a long time coming the fact that Jane Fonda has been a well accepted part of Hollywood for decades after doing what she did during the Vietnam War is insane and without apology is even more insane so the that's pretty amazing okay one more thing that I like this is an amazing video of a 20 week old baby in utero and again one of the reasons that the pro-life movement is making so much so much hay right now is because we can actually see inside the womb right and you couldn't see inside the womb then you could pretend that that wasn't a baby in there now they can see inside the womb better and better these days it is obvious that that is of course a child that you're killing a child when you decide to quote-unquote abort I mean if you can't see this that's a baby right there there's no way to look at that and not saying it's a baby it's a baby and the woman obviously it's a fully-formed baby in the womb at 20 weeks by the way the idea that that humanity is only based on what we can recognize physically is also silly but there's a reason that Planned Parenthood truly objects to 40 ultrasounds and 3d ultrasounds the idea is that they have they they hate the idea that people are actually going to be forced to look at the child that they're going to kill I mean it's an amazing imagery of that imagery just incredible is so that's amazing stuff okay time for a couple of things that I hate let's do that they don't really do one thing I hate today so that is morning Joe decided to cut an anthem for the women's March so all of the virtue signaling about the women's March is just ridiculous all the way through morning Joe used to be a quote-unquote fair and balanced show right where Joe Scarborough is the Republican and Mika Brzezinski was the Democrat and now they're married to each other which is weird dynamic but in any case here was Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski talking about how they had cut an anthem for the women's March because we all have to pretend that the women's March is some grand special thing when in reality women literally have no idea why they're marching they're going out there because it's called the women's March there's a very funny video going around online where a lot of women were being asked what are you marching for and some of them have the platitudinous answers about equal pay but some of them just say we're marching for women and they don't actually know what they're marching about anyway here is the the anthem being played by by by Joe Scarborough we go to break with some of the powerful images from over the weekend as millions of Americans gathered in cities and streets across the nation for the 2018 women's March once any life you may get the chance to stand comes to call them at a president is hearing it just over I'm holding up your hand you're not setting against tanks when you stand against Rome we're not stopping where's I deep within your heart that change the outcome have somebody like this in the white house I mean just the propaganda and the propaganda purely about Trump right the whole the whole song is just and they're just showing pictures of Trump and how terrible Trump is right as it I mean the lyrics from once in your life you may get a chance to stand against a column of Tanks like Trump is a column of Tanks what in the world yeah now MSNBC then they're maybe just a little bit of bias there okay time for a quick deconstruction of the culture so one of the things that came up during the women's March apparently there are some lyrics to a song called bodek yellow which I've never heard of these things so that's why I analyzed them for you because if I haven't heard of them I assume that you haven't either maybe I'm just uninformed in any case they're a bunch of they're a bunch of pictures from the women's March that that have people holding up Bo dak yellow lyrics little bleeps you can't f with me right so that's a picture of one there's shoes stomping on trump's head then there's another one of shoes stomping on Pence's head bloody moves and then it's a picture of I don't know is that supposed to be a period I'm confused as to what this is supposed to be in any case these lyrics have apparently become a thing now so let's look a little bit at the video for Bo dak yellow and explain why this has become a phenomenon okay one of the things that I do like about this video is that she's literally riding a camel in the middle of the Arabian desert presumably that is not a very empowered place just noting that's not that's not a place where strippers make lots of money in Saudi Arabia right but in any case boudic yellows I guess her cardi B is is the name of this human and cardi B began stripping at the age of 19 she still says the strip club is her favorite place for dates and then she was on Love & Hip Hop in New York and then she and then she does all of the sort of shock tactics that you expect from from your normal rapper but here's what the lyrics actually saying this is supposed to be this is supposed to be empowering for women okay this is if this is empowerment for women let me suggest that women need to to think more of themselves because this seems rather degrading actually she says let's find out and see cardi B you know where I'm at you know where I be you and the club just a party I'm there I get paid a fee I'd be in and out then Bank so much I know they're tired of me but honestly I don't give a bleep about who ain't fond of me drop two mixtapes in six months what bleep working as hard as me so she hasn't work ethics that's that's good she's I don't bother with these hoes don't let these hoes bother me they say pictures they say goals B I'm who they trying to be look I might just chill in some babe I might just chill with your boo I might just feel on your babe my bleep feel like a lake he want to swim with his face so now it seems like she's getting aggressive with other women so I'm missing the part where this is all female solidarity when she's talking about how she's competing with other women to take their men and also she works harder than you but it's so empowered it's just so all of this is so empowered I mean and she by the way she uses language that if a man used this language it would be considered sexist races if you'e bleep you get popped bleep being a word for the female anatomy if men use the word that way they are considered sexist if a woman like like cardi B the word than its empowerment I my bleep is glitter as gold I don't know why again I guess if you're obsessed with your own genitalia then this is empowering to you but I guess the what I'm not sure what else to expect from a woman's March that thinks it's empowerment to actually wear a hat on your head that is supposedly named after a vagina and the so just well done women all over the United States we're really empowering themselves by by glorifying stripping and glorifying cheating and glorifying stepping on other women because that's what you can do just really really good female solidarity stuff there okay so we will be back here tomorrow with much more we will be broadcasting from the great state of Connecticut so we will see you then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben
