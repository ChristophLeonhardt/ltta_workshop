1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,389
WHINING ABOUT THE CULT OF TRUMP

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,558
AFTER EIGHT YEARS OVER SWOONING

3
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:08,795
OVER THE REAL MESSIAH, OBAMA.

4
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:12,398
BUT WE BEGIN WITH BROAD SIDES

5
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:14,601
FROM TEAM TRUMP ON THE CLINTON

6
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:16,202
EMAIL INVESTIGATION.

7
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:18,438
STARTING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP,

8
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,507
SHOT AT THE FBI BRASS AND CHIEF,

9
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:22,642
THE CHIEF HE FIRED, OF COURSE

10
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:24,144
JIM COMEY.

11
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:27,280
ON FOX AND FRIENDS THIS MORNING,

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,982
THE PRESIDENT TOOK A SWIPE AT

13
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:33,219
WHAT HE CALLED THE SCUM AT THE

14
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,221
TOP OF THE BUREAU UNDER OBAMA.

15
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:36,923
>>  THE FBI LOOKS BAD, VERY BAD.

16
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:40,160
>>  NO, IT'S COMEY.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,261
INTERPRET TALKING ABOUT COMEY,

18
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:42,495
NOT MY FBI.

19
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:44,030
THE PEOPLE IN THE FBI ARE

20
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,430
INCREDIBLE.

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,900
I WOULD BET IF YOU TOOK A POLL

22
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,601
IN THE FBI, I WOULD WIN THAT

23
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,070
POLL BY MORE THAN ANYBODY THAT'S

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,206
EVER WON A POLL.

25
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:53,940
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED.

26
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,011
THEY WERE PLOTTING AGAINST MY

27
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:58,678
ELECTION.

28
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,280
PRESIDENTIAL ATTORNEY RUDY

29
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,515
GIULIANI SAID COMEY SHOULD BE

30
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:04,184
INVESTIGATE AND THAT THE FBI

31
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:06,953
AGENT "FIRED TODAY AND IN PRISON

32
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:09,022
NEXT WEEK."

33
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:12,125
>>LET'S INVESTIGATE THE

34
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,626
INVESTIGATORS.

35
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,461
LET'S STOP AND LET'S TURN AND

36
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,265
GET RID OF ALL THE AGENTS DURING

37
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:20,333
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

38
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,902
HE SHOULDN'T BE WORKING AT THE

39
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:23,169
FBI.

40
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,104
HE'S GOT EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS AND

41
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:29,842
PROBABLY NEEDS VALIUM OR

42
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:30,410
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

43
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,280
>>  HE VOWED TO STOP TRUMP FROM

44
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,348
BECOMING PRESIDENT.

45
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:39,219
STRZOK IS NOW FACING HIS OWN DAY

46
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:43,022
OF RECKONING.

47
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,225
STRZOK WAS THE LEAD FBI AGENT,

48
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:46,459
REMEMBER, IN THE CLINTON EMAIL

49
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:48,595
PROBE, A TOP AGENT IN THE FBI'S

50
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:51,164
RUSSIA PROBE, AND THE AGENT WHO

51
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:54,400
INTERVIEWED FORMER NATIONAL

52
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,305
SECURITY ADVISOR MIKE FLYNN.

53
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:02,575
ALL THAT ENDED OF COURSE WHEN

54
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:08,481
STRZOK'S BOMBASTIC ANTI-TRUMP

55
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:10,583
TEXTS WERE REVEALED.

56
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,519
HE WAS DEMOTED TO THE FBI'S HR

57
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:14,587
DEPARTMENT.

58
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:16,723
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY

59
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:18,825
THE HECK IS HE STILL WORKING AT

60
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:21,060
THE FBI, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF

61
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,262
THE TEXT MESSAGE REVEALED

62
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:24,764
YESTERDAY WHERE HE VOWED TO STOP

63
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:27,667
TRUMP FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT.

64
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:34,440
JOINING ME NOW, JOHN, ATTORNEY,

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,243
AND FORMER ASSISTANT ATTORNEY

66
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,979
GENERAL, ROBERT DRISCOLL.

67
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:40,346
ALL RIGHT.

68
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:41,981
I WANT TO START WITH YOU, BOB,

69
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:43,182
ON THIS, BECAUSE IT'S

70
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:45,385
FASCINATING TO ME HOW WHEN YOU

71
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:47,253
SURVEY THE OTHER NETWORKS OVER

72
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:52,025
THE LAST 24 HOURS, IT WAS LIKE

73
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:55,662
ON TO STORMY DANIELS.

74
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:56,562
THEY SPENT PRECIOUS LITTLE TIME

75
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,664
ON THIS.

76
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,499
THIS IS A BIG NOTHING BURGER.

77
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:02,302
I'M SO SICK OF THAT WORD, BY THE

78
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:02,802
WAY.

79
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:05,204
BUT LET'S REMEMBER WHAT HOROWITZ

80
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,205
DID CONCLUDE.

81
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:08,207
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

82
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:10,877
DEPARTING SO CLEARLY AND

83
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:13,046
DRAMATICALLY, THE DECISIONS

84
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,347
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE

85
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:15,682
PERCEPTIONS OF THE FBI AND

86
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:18,184
DEPARTMENT AS FAIR

87
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:19,752
ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE.

88
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,821
ROBERT, FAIR ADMINISTRATORS OF

89
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:26,059
JUSTICE NOW WITH A RUSSIA

90
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,527
COLLUSION PROBE GONE FOR MORE

91
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:31,264
THAN A YEAR, ABOUT $18 MILLION

92
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:32,665
IT'S COST, APPARENTLY WITH NO

93
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:33,933
END IN SIGHT.

94
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,668
>>  THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE.

95
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:39,205
THE REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THERE

96
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,040
WAS RAMPANT BIAS WITH THE FBI

97
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,241
AND THE DOJ.

98
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:44,844
ALL THE REPORT SAYS, AND I THINK

99
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:46,846
PEOPLE TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT.

100
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:49,182
THE REPORT SAYS THAT HOROWITZ

101
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:51,684
COULDN'T LINK THE EXAMPLES OF

102
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:53,486
BIAS TO ANY PARTICULAR

103
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:54,320
INVESTIGATIVE DECISION.

104
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,823
WHICH OF COURSE HE COULDN'T.

105
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:59,125
NO ONE WRITES DOWN WHEN THEY'RE

106
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:03,629
DOING SOMETHING THAT IMPROPER.

107
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:13,306
BUT HE FOUND BIAS ON EACH PAGE.

108
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,507
INVESTIGATIVE DECISION WAS

109
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:14,907
DEFENSIBLE.

110
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:16,576
NOT PROPER, BUT JUST DEFENSIBLE,

111
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:18,911
HE PASSED ON IT.

112
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:25,084
SO I THINK IT REALLY IS, TO ME,

113
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:29,589
SHOCKINGLY BAD, BOTH THE BREADTH

114
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:30,923
OF THE REPORT AND BIAS AND

115
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,993
CORRUPTION WAS SHOCKING.

116
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:36,462
>>  PETER STRZOK IS STILL

117
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:39,031
COLLECTING A TAXPAYER-FUNDED

118
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,700
SALARY, WHICH, I MEAN, I CAN'T

119
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,902
BELIEVE HE'S STILL WORKING, AND

120
00:04:42,902 --> 00:04:45,772
OF ALL PLACES, IN HUMAN

121
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:46,139
RESOURCES.

122
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,740
THAT JUST TAKES THE CAKE.

123
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,143
YOU CAN'T WRITE HOW STUPID THAT

124
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:50,410
IS.

125
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,647
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE BOB GOODLATTE

126
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:59,185
DOES WANT HIM TO TESTIFY ON

127
00:04:59,185 --> 00:04:59,619
CAPITOL HILL.

128
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:01,087
HE'S GETTING THAT SUBPOENA.

129
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:03,389
THE PROCESS TAKES ABOUT TWO

130
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:03,689
DAYS.

131
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,992
BUT HE WANTS STRZOK ON CAPITOL

132
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:08,194
HILL AND HE WANTS INFORMATION

133
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:09,695
AND HE WANTS IT LIKE YESTERDAY.

134
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:10,163
>>  RIGHT.

135
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:12,465
AND THE QUESTION IS, WHEN YOU

136
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,568
READ THIS SHOCKING REPORT, WHY

137
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:18,237
HE'S HAD THIS JOB FOR SO LONG,

138
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:19,939
STRZOK, AND WRAY, WHO THE

139
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,741
PRESIDENT WAS PRAISING IN HIS

140
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,875
TWEETS, WHY THEY HAVEN'T DONE

141
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,310
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ALREADY.

142
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,311
THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF BIAS.

143
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:27,280
WE SEE THE SHOCKING INSTANCE OF

144
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,650
THE TEXT THAT HE SENT BACK TO

145
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,586
HIS LOVER ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T

146
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:36,456
GOING TO LET TRUMP BECOME THE

147
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:36,823
PRESIDENT.

148
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:39,559
THAT WAS WITH HELD FROM

149
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,027
CONGRESS.

150
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:42,462
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A VERY THOROUGH

151
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,697
REPORT, BUT THE CONCLUSION IS,

152
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:47,166
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE A SMOKING

153
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,201
GUN, SO WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

154
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:48,968
ABOUT IT.

155
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:51,170
THAT'S THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG

156
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,372
WITH AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR

157
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,876
GENERAL INVESTIGATION.

158
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:57,810
THEY DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO

159
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,678
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

160
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:00,947
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO CUT IT

161
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:03,216
HERE WITH THE DAMAGE DONE TO OUR

162
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:04,650
COUNTRY AND THE DAMAGE BEING

163
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,485
DONE WITH THE MUELLER

164
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:06,018
INVESTIGATION.

165
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:08,321
IT REQUIRES STRONGER MEASURES

166
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:09,589
THAN SIMPLY AN INVESTIGATION

167
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:10,690
INTO WHAT WENT WRONG.

168
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,691
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

169
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:11,958
IT.

170
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,626
>>  JOHN, THE DAMAGE TO THE FBI,

171
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:15,895
I THINK, CANNOT BE OVERSTATED

172
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:16,229
HERE.

173
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,064
WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK

174
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:21,200
SO HARD IN THE FIELD OFFICES ALL

175
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,436
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, DAY BY DAY,

176
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:26,172
NIGHT BY NIGHT, TO KEEP

177
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:27,607
AMERICANS SAFE AND DO REALLY

178
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:30,076
GREAT INVESTIGATIVE WORK.

179
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:33,179
THIS ENDED UP BEING A POLITICAL

180
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,881
RESEARCH OPERATION AGAINST --

181
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,648
ULTIMATELY, AGAINST THE

182
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:37,250
PRESIDENT WITH THE RUSSIA PROBE,

183
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,052
BUT A CYA SITUATION WITH HILLARY

184
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:41,954
CLINTON IN THESE EMAILS ALL

185
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:42,288
ALONG.

186
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:44,557
IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS REPORT

187
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:46,092
-- I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH MOST OF

188
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:50,730
IT -- THERE IS A LOT IN THIS

189
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,132
REPORT THAT THE PRESS IS

190
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:53,633
GLOSSING OVER.

191
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:54,567
>>  YOU'RE RIGHT.

192
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,369
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS SOME

193
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:57,904
HORRIBLE THINGS WERE DONE THAT

194
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,338
SHOULD HAVE NEVER OCCURRED.

195
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:00,873
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT IN THE

196
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:01,641
CONTEXT THOUGH.

197
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,909
REMEMBER, THIS IS A GROUP OF

198
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,577
INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW EACH OTHER.

199
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:07,413
SOME WERE HAND PICKED BY THEIR

200
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:08,781
FRIENDS TO WORK IN THIS PROJECT,

201
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,850
IF YOU WILL.

202
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,021
MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE 35,000 FBI

203
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:15,988
EMPLOYEES DOING GOOD THINGS

204
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:16,589
EVERY DAY.

205
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,558
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THEY NEED

206
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:19,759
TO COME CLEAN.

207
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,893
YOU'RE RIGHT.

208
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:22,328
WHETHER OR NOT MR. STRZOK SHOULD

209
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:25,131
BE WORKING AT FBI HEADQUARTERS

210
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,300
IS CERTAINLY A QUESTION WE'RE

211
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,633
ASKING.

212
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,168
>>  THE IG DID NOT SAY HE FOUND

213
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:30,636
NO BIAS AT THE FBI.

214
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:32,672
HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO

215
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:34,373
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE THAT BIAS

216
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:35,274
PRODUCED SPECIFIC DECISIONS.

217
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:39,045
AND WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER,

218
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:40,012
THERE'S ANOTHER IG REPORT COMING

219
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:43,983
DOWN THE PIKE.

220
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,851
THAT COULD END UP BEING LOADED

221
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:46,953
WITH EVIDENCE OF SUCH BIAS

222
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,054
BECAUSE THAT'S ABOUT LOOKING

223
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:50,389
INTO THE INFORMANTS THAT WERE

224
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,291
USED IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

225
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,860
MAYBE THE POTENTIAL FISA ABUSES,

226
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,762
THE FBI HANDLING OF THE RUSSIA

227
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:57,096
PROBE.

228
00:07:57,096 --> 00:08:00,566
I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU, BOB.

229
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:04,270
THINKING THE IG -- TRUMP WAS

230
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,737
ANNOYED TODAY.

231
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:10,109
HE PETERED OUT AT THE END.

232
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:11,677
I THINK THIS OTHER REPORT COULD

233
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:14,113
BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN SEEING

234
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:17,950
WHAT HAPPENS TO PLACED

235
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,251
INDIVIDUALS OR ENCOURAGED

236
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,888
INDIVIDUALS TO TRY TO PENETRATE

237
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:25,524
THESE LOWER-LEVEL PEOPLE INSIDE

238
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:26,492
THE CAMPAIGN.

239
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,294
>>  WE'LL FIND THE BASIS FOR

240
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:29,428
THIS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION,

241
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:30,529
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS THE

242
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:33,131
DOSSIER ORIGINALLY OR THE

243
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,033
OPPOSITION RESEARCH GENERATED

244
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,501
INVESTIGATION TOTALLY OR NOT.

245
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:38,070
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'LL BE

246
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,039
ABLE TO LAY IT SIDE BY SIDE WITH

247
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,707
THE IG REPORT THAT JUST CAME

248
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:42,975
OUT.

249
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:46,746
IT'LL PROVIDE CONTEXT.

250
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:48,247
IN THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION, WE

251
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:52,051
HAVE THE GUY BEING GRANTED

252
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:56,322
IMMUNITY FOR ESSENTIALLY

253
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:56,656
NOTHING.

254
00:08:56,656 --> 00:09:02,895
NO PROSECUTION.

255
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,264
I MEAN, ALL THOSE THINGS MAY BE

256
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:08,434
DEFENSIBLE INDIVIDUALLY IN A

257
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,036
VACUUM, BUT AN INCREDIBLY LIGHT

258
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:11,604
TOUCH FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVER GONE

259
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,105
THROUGH AN FBI INVESTIGATION.

260
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,941
AND WE'LL GET TO COMPARE THAT

261
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:18,110
TO, GEE, WHAT DO YOU KNOW,

262
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,112
PEOPLE'S HOUSES ARE BEING

263
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:23,549
SEARCHED AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING.

264
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:25,818
AND SO I THINK THIS SECOND

265
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,153
REPORT COULD HAVE -- COULD BE A

266
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:30,756
BIG DEAL, COULD FILL IN SOME OF

267
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:39,231
THESE GAPS,

268
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,232
>>GETTING THIS PROFESSOR IN

269
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:40,566
LONDON.

270
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:41,801
ALL THIS STUFF THAT THEY WERE

271
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:42,968
TRYING TO DO.

272
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:45,137
MY GOODNESS, THEY WERE LEAVING

273
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:47,540
NO STONE UNTURNED.

274
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,508
TRYING TO GET A RUSSIAN

275
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:50,843
BILLIONAIRE TO HELP.

276
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,445
THEY'LL DOING EVERYTHING.

277
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:53,813
MEANWHILE WITH HILLARY, IT'S

278
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:55,614
LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T GET THE

279
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:56,415
WIENER LAPTOP.

280
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:58,150
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT ON THAT.

281
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,952
SO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH,

282
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:01,153
WHICH ALSO COMES THROUGH WHEN

283
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:05,257
YOU READ THE TOTALITY OF THIS

284
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:05,591
REPORT.

285
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,727
GIULIANI TODAY TALKED ABOUT THE

286
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,729
QUESTION WE'VE BEEN TALKING

287
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:11,530
ABOUT FOR MONTHS HERE ABOUT

288
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,398
WHETHER THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

289
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:13,165
TESTIFY.

290
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:15,468
I WANT YOU ALL TO LISTEN

291
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:16,535
CAREFULLY TO THIS.

292
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:17,770
>>  WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD

293
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,438
HAPPEN NOW IN THE MUELLER

294
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:19,872
INVESTIGATION?

295
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:21,240
>>  THEY SHOULD END IT.

296
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,275
THE IG REPORT BASICALLY TELLS

297
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,078
YOU THAT BOTH PRONGS OF THE

298
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:27,780
MUELLER INVESTIGATION ARE EITHER

299
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,281
CORRUPT OR ANSWERED.

300
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:31,417
>>  AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THE

301
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,553
PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT -- HE

302
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:35,888
BASICALLY SAID NO INTERVIEW.

303
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,356
THE PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T BE

304
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:39,024
BOTHERED WITH IT.

305
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,894
ANY THINKING OF YOUR EXCHANGE

306
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:43,696
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE

307
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,898
POSSIBLE PERJURY TRAP?

308
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:47,700
PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKES TO TALK.

309
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,301
HE LOVES TO GET HIS POINT

310
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:49,635
ACROSS.

311
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,137
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, HE

312
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:51,637
SAYS.

313
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,172
SO HE'S LIKE, I'M HAPPY TO TALK.

314
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:54,173
HE WANTS TO TALK.

315
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:57,009
BUT AS A LAWYER, I'M A LAWYER AS

316
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,978
WELL, HOW DANGEROUS IS IT FOR

317
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:01,213
HIM TO GO INTO THAT SPECIAL

318
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:01,714
COUNSEL'S OFFICE?

319
00:11:01,714 --> 00:11:04,016
>>  SO AS FOR THE FIRST PART OF

320
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:08,521
YOUR QUESTION, DOES IT CHANGE

321
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:08,888
ANYTHING?

322
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:09,155
NO.

323
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,056
FROM DAY ONE, I THOUGHT THE

324
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,158
PRESIDENT SHOULDN'T TALK.

325
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,559
THEY'RE THE GUNNERS.

326
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,860
THEY'RE THE GO-GETTERS.

327
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,996
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WANT TO

328
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,898
MAKE THEIR CASE AND NAME.

329
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,399
NO BIGGER PREY THAN THE

330
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,300
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

331
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,838
HE SHOULD NOT GO IN THERE

332
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:29,975
BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONFIDENCE

333
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:31,377
THAT THE DECK WON'T BE STACKED

334
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:32,011
AGAINST HIM.

335
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:33,045
WE'VE SEEN THAT.

336
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:36,215
BUT IN TERMS OF WITNESSES, A

337
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:38,717
CEO, A POWERFUL PERSON IS THE

338
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:39,685
WORST WITNESS.

339
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,320
THEY'RE USED TO GETTING THEIR

340
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,587
WAY.

341
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:42,388
EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM SUCKS UP

342
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:43,656
TO THEM.

343
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:46,458
IT'S JUST A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

344
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,060
SCENARIO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

345
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,596
EVEN SEEMINGLY CASUALLY TO A

346
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:52,965
PROSECUTOR OR FBI AGENT.

347
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,834
IT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE FOR

348
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,635
ANY CEO OR PRESIDENT, BUT

349
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:57,970
PARTICULARLY FOR THIS PRESIDENT.

350
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,972
NOW WE'VE SEEN THE CORRUPTION

351
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:00,840
PERVADING THE FBI.

352
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,174
SO ABSOLUTELY NOT.

353
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,576
>>  GIULIANI'S POINT TODAY WAS,

354
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:05,578
NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN, WE KNOW

355
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:08,881
JUST WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THERE

356
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:11,851
WITH THE DESPERATE EFFORT TO

357
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,153
STOP HIM FROM BECOMING

358
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:15,955
PRESIDENT, AND SHE GETS TO SIT

359
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:17,223
IN THERE WHEN THEY'RE TALKING

360
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:18,290
ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD

361
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,492
SUBPOENA HILLARY, THE COZY

362
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:21,861
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRESS

363
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,996
AND THE FBI AGENTS, THE PRESS

364
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,998
ARE GIVING PERKS TO THE FBI

365
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:26,599
AGENTS.

366
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,601
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE

367
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:29,501
LEAKS CAME FROM.

368
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:30,202
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

369
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:33,839
I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU, JOHN,

370
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,242
BECAUSE WE HAVE JOHN WHO

371
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,776
EXCLUSIVELY GAVE US A COMMENT

372
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:42,681
TONIGHT ABOUT WHAT THIS IG

373
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,484
REPORT ACTUALLY SAYS.

374
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:48,020
THE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF HIS USURP

375
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,823
OF POWER, VIOLATION OF OATH OF

376
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:53,359
OFFICE, AND MATERIAL FALSE

377
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,493
STATEMENTS OF THE PUBLIC AND

378
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:56,896
CONGRESS, ALL TO CONCEAL HIS OWN

379
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:57,429
CONDUCT.

380
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:02,201
THE FINDING OF NO BIAS WAS

381
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:02,568
LUDICROUS.

382
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:07,940
THE OIG'S FINDINGS SUPPORT THE

383
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,942
DECISION TO FIRE COMEY.

384
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:10,509
>>  ABSOLUTELY.

385
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:11,377
HE WAS FIRED BECAUSE OF THE

386
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:13,178
THINGS HE HAD DONE AND THE

387
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:14,179
PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT TO TAKE

388
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:15,180
THOSE ACTIONS.

389
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,417
I ALSO THINK A LOT OF THINGS

390
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,219
HAVE BEEN MADE OUT OF THE FACT

391
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:21,921
THAT THE PRESIDENT FIRED THE

392
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:24,123
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI.

393
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:25,424
IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED.

394
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:30,229
WE SAW IT WITH WILLIAM SESSIONS.

395
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:33,532
BUT THIS IS CLEARLY BASED ON THE

396
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:35,501
REPORT WE'RE SEEING, GIVES GOOD

397
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,902
CAUSE AND JUSTIFICATION TO THE

398
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,304
ACTIONS THE PRESIDENT TOOK.

399
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,940
>>  THERE WAS ALSO THE SHOCKING

400
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,473
DEVELOPMENT TODAY.

401
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:44,043
A FEDERAL JUDGE APPOINTED BY

402
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:49,915
OBAMA ACTUALLY JAILED PAUL AFTER

403
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,684
MUELLER CLAIMED HE TRIED TO

404
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:53,919
TAMPER WITH WITNESSES.

405
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,155
GIULIANI RESPONDED BY FLOATING

406
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:59,425
THE IDEA OF PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS

407
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,260
IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

408
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,762
ROBERT, THIS LED JEFFREY TO SAY

409
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:06,865
THE FOLLOWING ABOUT GIULIANI.

410
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:07,166
WATCH.

411
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,735
>>  IT IS SO CORRUPT AND

412
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:11,270
UNETHICAL WHAT GIULIANI SAID.

413
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,740
I MEAN, WE ARE IN AN AREA HERE

414
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,109
THAT IS LITERALLY

415
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,143
UNPRECEDENTEDED BECAUSE NOT THAT

416
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:19,278
MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICAN LIFE

417
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,482
HAVE THE POWER TO GIVE A PARDON.

418
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,517
WE ARE SO FAR OUT OF NORMAL

419
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:27,987
ETHICAL BEHAVIOR, THAT IT'S JUST

420
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:29,221
WORTH PRESERVING OUR SENSE OF

421
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:30,356
OUTRAGE ABOUT IT BECAUSE SO MUCH

422
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:33,459
OF THIS STUFF HAPPENS EVERY DAY.

423
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:35,694
BUT IT REALLY IS APPALLING.

424
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:37,830
>>  A SENSE OF OUTRAGE.

425
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:45,371
JEFFREY AND THAT OUTRAGE.

426
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:47,339
ROBERT, NEVERTHELESS, THE

427
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,774
THROWING OUT THE PARDON THING.

428
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,743
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

429
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:52,778
THAT IF I WERE RUDY TODAY.

430
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:56,682
>>  WELL, AND THE OTHER REASON

431
00:14:56,682 --> 00:15:00,519
TOO IS JUST STRATEGICALLY AS A

432
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,821
DEFENSE LAWYER, I WOULDN'T WANT

433
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:07,559
HIM PARDONED BEFORE THE CASE IS

434
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:07,993
OVER.

435
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:11,563
AND SO IF HE IS PARDONED, HE NO

436
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:13,532
LONGER FACING CRIMINAL

437
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:13,932
PROSECUTION.

438
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,401
HE COULD CONCEIVABLY BE FORCED

439
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:16,335
TO TESTIFY.

440
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,103
AND MORE OVER, THERE'S JUST NO

441
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,605
REASON TO HANDLE IT NOW.

442
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:21,540
YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE WHERE THE

443
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,307
CHIPS FALL.

444
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:23,642
AND IF SOME POINT LATER THE

445
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:26,078
PRESIDENT WANTS TO PARDON, HE

446
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:26,445
CAN.

447
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:31,683
AS FAR AS BEING UNPRECEDENTED,

448
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:37,523
GEORGE BUSH SR. PARDONED THE DAY

449
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,090
BEFORE THE TRIAL.

450
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,591
IT'S BEEN DONE.

451
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:42,061
THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S THE

452
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:43,562
INHERENT POWER THE PRESIDENT

453
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:43,829
HAS.

454
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,631
THERE'S NO REAL CHECK ON IT.

455
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:47,232
I JUST CAN'T GET THAT OUTRAGE

456
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:47,566
THOUGH.

457
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:51,203
THE ANSWER TO IT IS A POLITICAL

458
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:52,838
ANSWER, WHICH IS IT WAS DONE

459
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:54,173
PUBLICLY AND THE PRESIDENT CAN

460
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:58,143
SUFFER BLOWBACKS IF HE DOES IT.

461
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:01,880
>>  AND WE HAD A MYRIAD OF

462
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,082
INSTANCES WHERE THE OBAMA

463
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:04,683
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT -- WE HAD

464
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:07,619
ERIC HOLDER HELD IN CONTEMPT OF

465
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:08,921
CONGRESS OVER THE DOCUMENTS, I

466
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:13,492
THINK IT WAS FAST AND FURIOUS.

467
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:16,628
THERE'S NO MORAL OUTRAGE.

468
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:18,497
GIVE ME A BREAK.

469
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:19,131
>>  YEAH.

470
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,300
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GIVE HIM THE

471
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,402
SMELLING SALT, THE SELECTIVE

472
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:28,440
OUTRAMBLING, THE HYPOCRISY IS

473
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,807
LAUGHABLE.

474
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:31,443
THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED AS

475
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:32,311
AMERICANS ABOUT THE CORRUPTION

476
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:33,879
OF THE FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES OF

477
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,881
THE GOVERNMENT AND NOT ABOUT

478
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:36,949
THIS ONE INSTANCE.

479
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:41,520
I OUTRAGED THAT A JUDGE IS

480
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,722
APPEARING TO USE AN

481
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:48,894
INCARCERATION AS A PENALTY AS A

482
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:50,229
PUNISHMENT PRIOR TO A TRIAL.

483
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:53,098
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE USED IN

484
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:54,600
PREVENTIVE ATTENTION WHERE IT

485
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,301
DEALS WITH FLIGHT RISKS AND

486
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,736
OTHER ISSUES.

487
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:58,704
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE

488
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:00,873
OUTRAGED ABOUT.

489
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:02,741
>>  SHE WAS REALLY LECTURING

490
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:04,343
TODAY SAYING BASICALLY YOU'RE

491
00:17:04,343 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT IN JUNIOR HIGH.
