WHEN THE SEPARATION POLICY WAS REALLY GEARING UP IN FULL SWING

100
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,478
REALLY GEARING UP IN FULL SWING WAS ABOUT 2,300.

101
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,179
WAS ABOUT 2,300. THERE ARE 2,300 CHILDREN WHO

00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,281
THERE ARE 2,300 CHILDREN WHO WERE MADE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS

103
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,484
WERE MADE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS BECAUSE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION

104
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:15,887
BECAUSE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND ABOUT 11,200 IN TOTAL IN HHS

AND ABOUT 11,200 IN TOTAL IN HHS CUSTODY.

106
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:17,322
CUSTODY. SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN

107
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,456
SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN SEPARATED BEFORE AND SOME OF

108
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,792
SEPARATED BEFORE AND SOME OF THOSE CROSSED WITHOUT PARENTS

109
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:21,192
THOSE CROSSED WITHOUT PARENTS ALTOGETHER.

110
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:24,095
ALTOGETHER. BUT WE KNOW THAT ABOUT 300 TO

111
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:26,297
BUT WE KNOW THAT ABOUT 300 TO 500 WERE EASILY REUNITED.

112
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,632
500 WERE EASILY REUNITED. THAT DOESN’T MEAN THEY REACHED

113
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,234
THAT DOESN’T MEAN THEY REACHED IN AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SOME

114
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:31,603
IN AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SOME SORT OF SYSTEMATIC REUNITING.

115
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,238
SORT OF SYSTEMATIC REUNITING. THOSE WERE CHILDREN WE BELIEVE

116
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,006
THOSE WERE CHILDREN WE BELIEVE WHO HAD JUST RECENTLY CROSSED

117
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,907
WHO HAD JUST RECENTLY CROSSED THE BORDER.

118
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:37,308
THE BORDER. THEY WERE STILL IN THE CUSTODY

119
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,011
THEY WERE STILL IN THE CUSTODY OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER

120
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:40,411
OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION.

121
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,248
PROTECTION. IT IS MUCH EASIER BEFORE YOU

122
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,282
IT IS MUCH EASIER BEFORE YOU SEND THEM OUT TO 17 STATES

123
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:45,150
SEND THEM OUT TO 17 STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

124
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:48,387
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY’RE CLOSE BY TO THE FEDERAL

125
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,655
THEY’RE CLOSE BY TO THE FEDERAL DETENTION CENTERS TO QUICKLY PUT

126
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:50,689
DETENTION CENTERS TO QUICKLY PUT THEM TOGETHER.

127
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,057
THEM TOGETHER. NOW THEY ARE FAR FLUNG AND THERE

128
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,859
NOW THEY ARE FAR FLUNG AND THERE DOESN’T SEEM TO BE A SYSTEMATIC

129
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,360
DOESN’T SEEM TO BE A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO DO THIS.

130
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:56,895
WAY TO DO THIS. AND SOMETHING THAT DERREK

131
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,363
AND SOMETHING THAT DERREK TOUCHED ON THAT I WANT TO GO

132
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,965
TOUCHED ON THAT I WANT TO GO BACK TO, ABOUT THE FORCED CHOICE

133
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,868
BACK TO, ABOUT THE FORCED CHOICE THAT IS REALLY NOT A FORCED

134
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:03,702
THAT IS REALLY NOT A FORCED CHOICE, THAT THE OBAMA

135
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:04,836
CHOICE, THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS IN THE SAME

136
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:05,771
ADMINISTRATION WAS IN THE SAME POSITION IN 2015.

137
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:07,473
POSITION IN 2015. THEY DIDN’T NEED A COURT ORDER

138
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,274
THEY DIDN’T NEED A COURT ORDER TO TELL THEM NOT TO SEPARATE

139
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:10,142
TO TELL THEM NOT TO SEPARATE PARENTS AND CHILDREN.

140
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:11,443
PARENTS AND CHILDREN. THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS A

141
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,078
THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS A HUMANITARIAN NONSTARTER.

142
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,214
HUMANITARIAN NONSTARTER. BUT THEY WERE ALSO OPERATING

143
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,182
BUT THEY WERE ALSO OPERATING PUNLD FLORES AGREEMENT THAT WAS

144
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,750
PUNLD FLORES AGREEMENT THAT WAS REINSTATED IN 2015 TO SAY THE

145
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:21,053
REINSTATED IN 2015 TO SAY THE APPLIED TO CHILDREN WITH THEIR

146
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:23,288
APPLIED TO CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS AND THEY DECIDED TO GO

147
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:24,890
PARENTS AND THEY DECIDED TO GO ON ANKLE MONITORS.

148
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,293
ON ANKLE MONITORS. SO THE FACT THAT IS NOT IN THE

149
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,361
SO THE FACT THAT IS NOT IN THE DISCUSSION NOW REALLY HAS A LOT

150
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:29,461
DISCUSSION NOW REALLY HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE SCRATCHING THEIR

151
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:29,761
OF PEOPLE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS.

152
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:30,996
HEADS. HOW CAN THEY COME FORWARD AND

153
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,631
HOW CAN THEY COME FORWARD AND MAKE A LEGAL ARGUMENT THEY HAVE

154
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:35,467
MAKE A LEGAL ARGUMENT THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE WHEN THE OBAMA

155
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:36,702
NO OTHER CHOICE WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS IN THE SAME

156
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:38,337
ADMINISTRATION WAS IN THE SAME PLACE AND FOUND ANOTHER

157
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,904
PLACE AND FOUND ANOTHER SOLUTION.

158
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:42,508

>> IT SEEMS THERE IS A REAL PRACTICAL, AND LEGAL

160
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:44,910
PRACTICAL, AND LEGAL HUMANITARIAN ISSUE, ARE THEY

00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:46,111
HUMANITARIAN ISSUE, ARE THEY GOING TO DO THIS?

162
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:47,380
GOING TO DO THIS? ARE THEY GOING TO COME MY WITH

163
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:48,781
ARE THEY GOING TO COME MY WITH THE FEDERAL COURT ORDER?

164
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,883
THE FEDERAL COURT ORDER? AND REUNITE THESE FAMILIES AND

165
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:52,318
AND REUNITE THESE FAMILIES AND THESE PARENTS AND KIDS?
