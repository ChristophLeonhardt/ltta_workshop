1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,120
A heinous crime has been committed at Vox.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,300
Somebody keeps drinking the single source
Ethiopian yirgacheffe coffee I bring to the

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,520
office for myself.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,960
I rounded up five suspects from around the
office and fingerprinted them

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,160
to see if I could find a match from a print
I found on my mug.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,160
Is fingerprint analysis reliable enough to
pin somebody to this unspeakable crime, and

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,980
more importantly ... uhhhh ... how do you actually do
this?

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,230
To help me figure out what the hell I’m
supposed to do I brought in an expert.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,230
My name is Peter Valentin.

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,879
I'm an expert in crime scene reconstruction
and forensic science.

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,399
A fingerprint is probably the most important
piece of information when we don't have a

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,489
known connection between the victim and the
offender.

13
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,589
We have to find something that people leave
at scenes relatively easily and something

14
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:02,989
that is unique enough that finding it and
identifying what it is will lead us back to

15
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:03,989
the person.

16
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,439
In order to find a fingerprint investigators
will either use a physical component like

17
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,770
a powder–

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,610
So not cocoa powder?

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,270
Cool cool cool.

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,840
Or a series of chemicals that make a print
visible on a surface.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,759
Our fingerprints have ridges and furrows that
align to create unique, recognizable patterns.

22
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,759
There is a what's called a loop right here,
you have ridges that are coming into the pattern

23
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,469
and then coming back out.

24
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,310
Here's another loop right here.

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,649
There's arches,

26
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:36,720
and there's whorls and those those three categories
alone comprise at least 95 percent of the

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,520
fingerprints that are in the database.

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,880
Everyone’s fingerprints have unique features
that differentiate them from everyone else’s.

29
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,330
For instance this ridge splits into two here
and this ridge has a break in it.

30
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,720
These patterns remain the same throughout
a person's lifetime, which makes them a

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,900
powerful identification tool.

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,770
My fingerprint is pretty easy to spot.

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,280
The pattern looks like a 1998 Chrysler Sebring.

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,380
Investigators rely on the characteristics
of a print to find a match using a method

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,979
called ACE-V.

36
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:08,169
First they analyze the print and the surface
it's on to see if it's viable for examination.

37
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,459
This one’s great.

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,970
This one, not so much.

39
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,290
Then, they take the suitable print and compare
it against known fingerprints looking for

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,640
points of similarities and differences.

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,690
For example both these patterns are whorls
and bifurcate right here.

42
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,170
Investigators look at these traits and try
to gauge if there’s enough points of comparison

43
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,690
to declare it a match.

44
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,280
Finally, a qualified peer reviews their conclusion
to verify the match.

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,220
After using high tech software to analyze
the prints from my mug – I’m kidding this

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,820
is just some stock footage I downloaded.

47
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,680
I think I finally found a match.

48
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,540
But, ok, even when it’s done by professionals...
how reliable is fingerprint analysis?

49
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,720
It's a useful tool that obviously has
value, but I think it's problematic to overstate

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,080
its value especially in a criminal justice
context.

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,370
One accuracy study found that examiners made
false positive identifications in .1% of cases.

52
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,630
Which means identifying a print as a match
when it’s not.

53
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,630
That doesn’t sound too bad... unless you
happen to be one of those false positives.

54
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,910
Brandon Mayfield, a lawyer from Oregon, was
one of those unlucky few.

55
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,781
He was falsely accused of the 2004 Madrid
train bombing because the FBI made a false

56
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:23,980
positive match with a partial print found
at the scene.

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,850
Mayfield seemed like a good suspect to investigators
because he had recently converted to Islam

58
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,480
and was the lawyer for a man who attempted
to join the Taliban, which in the wake of

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,980
9/11 were all red flags for the FBI.

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,000
There was a bias that existed because once
they tentatively identified the unknown fingerprint

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,920
as belonging to this individual who he was
and what his background was made the identification

62
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,750
seem stronger than it actually was.

63
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,640
He didn't have a valid passport.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,000
So it's a little implausible on the face of
it that he was handling a bag of detonators

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,900
in Spain.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,960
Fingerprinting was so powerful that it just
sort of it trumped everything else.

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,360
Mayfield was even given his own analyst who
examined the prints, and even they agreed

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
that it was a match.

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,560
That's an interesting thing about bias
because, you know, everybody's assumption

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,480
is that the experts are biased toward the
side that they're working for.

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,860
Here was a guy who was working for Mayfield
and yet he corroborated the evidence against

72
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,370
him which turned out to be incorrect.

73
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,069
The FBI released a 330-page report about where
their analysts went wrong, and it’s pretty

74
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,349
much a case study in a lot of the potential
downfalls of fingerprinting.

75
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:39,960
They cited things such as,

76
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,849
ignoring differences between the prints, lack
of independent verification, the pressure

77
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:51,250
of working on a high profile terrorism investigation,
and letting bias about the suspect affect

78
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,750
their analysis.

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,000
Their report summed it up by saying “in
any human endeavor, there is a potential for

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
error.”

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,259
You know I would suggest learning from history
and realizing that none of these things are

82
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,180
going to be error free.

83
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,460
So there's going to be mistakes and errors and
screw ups.

84
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:14,849
But also evidence is inherently probabilistic.

85
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:19,480
So even though it’s not a perfect tool,
until a more reliable technology emerges,

86
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,350
law enforcement will continue to utilize fingerprint
analysis.

87
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,160
And I won’t ever be fully certain of who
stole my coffee.

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:00:00,000
Until I catch him on this new surveillance
camera that I installed.
