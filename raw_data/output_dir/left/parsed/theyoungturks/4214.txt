WE HAVE A NEW
UPDATE IN, BREAKING NEWS.
NORTH KOREA HAS THREATENED GUAM
AGAIN, BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY.
THEY SAY ON THEIR STATE
TELEVISION WHICH IS
RAN BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO LAUNCH
FOUR INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES
AT GUAM.
THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO
PRESENT THAT PLAN AND KIM
JONG-IL AND HEíLL MAKE THE
DECISION ON WHETHER TO EXECUTE
IT, BUT THEY ARE VERY SPECIFIC
THAT THEY SAY THE ROCKETS
THAT WILL BE LAUNCHED BY THE
KOREAN PEOPLE'S ARMY, WILL
CROSS THIS GUY ABOVE HIROSHIMA,
IN JAPAN, AND RELATED GUAM.
THEY SAY THEY WILL FLY
356,000 KM FOR A 1065 SECONDS.
I'M BEING SERIOUS.
THIS IS THE PRESS RELEASE, AND
HIT THE WATERS 30 TO 40
KM AWAY FROM GUAM.
THAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE LINE
OF ATTACK AGAINST GUAM AND
THEY ARE SAYING THAT THEY WILL
BE DOING IT IN MID AUGUST.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
DECLARE THIS SPECIFIC A PLAN OF
ATTACK AGAINST ANOTHER COUNTRY
AND ANNOUNCE IT PUBLICLY.
AGAIN, THEY HUFF AND THEY PATH
AND THEY BEEN DOING THIS A
LONG TIME IN THE USUALLY DO NOT
ACTUALLY ATTACK PEOPLE.
THEY WANT TEST MISSILES ALL OF
THE TIME, BUT WE HAVE AN
EXTRAORDINARY SHOWDOWN HERE AND
I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU
GUYS, THIS IS VERY REAL.
WE HAVE TO INCREDIBLY ON
PREDICTABLE UNINTELLIGENT
LEADERS IN NORTH KOREA IN THE US
AND THEY BOTH HAVE INCREDIBLY
FRAGILE EGOS AND THEY KEEP
THREATENING ONE ANOTHER.
TRUMP SAID HE WILL BRING FIRE
AND FURY LIKE NOTICE EVER
SEEN BEFORE, INDICATING THAT HE
MIGHT USE NUKES AND THEN
THIS MORNING HE SAID YES,
WELCOME AND SWEETIE
REFERRED TO HOW WE HAVE NUKES,
THEY HAVE BEEN UPDATED AND
MODERNIZED AND THEY'RE READY TO
GO.
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HE IS
THREATENING NUCLEAR WAR
AGAINST NORTH KOREA.
NORTH KOREAN RETURN SAID THEY
WOULD HIT GUAM AND THEN
TODAY THIS UPDATE IS, HERE IS
EXACTLY HOW AND WHEN WE ARE
GOING TO HIT GUAM.
UNLESS THERE ARE COOLER HEADS,
AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANY EXIST
IN THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION
OR THE NORTH KOREAN
ADMINISTRATION, THE WORLD COULD
BE IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE HERE.
LINDSAY GRAHAM THE REPUBLICAN
SENATOR FROM SOUTH KOREA
SOUTH CAROLINA SAID TODAY IF
THEY COME ANYWHERE NEAR GUAM,
THIS IS NORMAL, IF YOU ATTACK
US, PERCY WILL TAKE YOU BACK NOT
NECESSARILY WITH NUKES, THAT'S
NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT,
BUT HE SAID THEY COME ANYWHERE
NEAR GUAM, WE WILL LAUNCH.
AGAIN, NOT NECESSARILY NUKES,
BUT TRUMP IS SAYING YES, NUKES.
IF THIS GOES FORWARD, AND
APPARENTLY WE'RE ON THE
CLOCK, MID-AUGUST IS NOT THAT
FAR.
ITíS ABOUT A WEEK AWAY.
WE MIGHT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
USED AGAIN ON EARTH.
THERE IS NO WINNING A NUCLEAR
WAR.
THERE IS ONLY LOSERS.
MILLIONS OF LIVES ARE ON THE
LINE.
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE
AFRAID OF IF DONALD TRUMP
GOT ELECTED AND RIGHT NOW, HE
HAS BLUNDERED HIS WAY RIGHT
INTO THE MIDDLE OF A CONFLICT
THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
LET'S HOPE THAT IT SOMEHOW
COOLS DOWN, BUT RIGHT NOW IT
LOOKS LIKE A WORLDWIDE DISASTER.
