At first glance Emmanuel
Macron and Donald Trump
seem to be unlikely allies.
“The United States will
cease all implementation
of the non-binding Paris Accord.”
“It is an actual mistake — both
for the U.S. and for our planet.”
“The Iran deal was
one of the worst
and most one-sided
transactions.”
“To officially recognize
Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel.”
“I thought that it was a mistake.”
Macron, a young centrist,
had won the French election
by rejecting far-right anger.
Trump had supported
his rival,
the staunch nationalist,
Marine Le Pen.
The two presidents’
first encounter
last spring was awkward.
Trump extended his arms
and greeting, but Macron
first approached Angela Merkel.
And when they did
greet each other,
Trump gave Macron
of his famous arm yanks.
Their handshakes would come to
take on a life of their own.
“It’s being described as an
epic handshake standoff.”
“Alpha male kind of engagement.”
“That’s what I call
a French press.”
“I think we just
surrendered to France.”
It was the beginning of Macron's 
political courtship of Trump.
Other European leaders, like
Angela Merkel and Theresa May,
have been wary of Trump’s
inflammatory rhetoric
and periodic taunting of some
of the United States’
most trusted allies.
“We work together does not mean
that we are afraid to say
when we think the United
States has got it wrong.
Retweeting from Britain First
was the wrong thing to do.”
Macron has mostly tried
a pragmatic approach.
He shrugged off some of
Trump’s provocations.
“I think we should not overplay 
the situation and his tweets.”
At Bastille Day, Macron
impressed his
American counterpart
with a military parade in Paris.
“One of the greatest
parades I've ever seen.”
And a promise of
unconditional loyalty.
There was also
the 30-second handshake.
Macron seemed to make
a point of saying
he and Trump were in close contact.
“I call him very regularly.”
“Probably three to four phone
calls during the past weeks.”
“We have a very
good relationship.”
But why would
Macron so openly embrace
a president who’s unpopular
at home and abroad?
It’s an attempt to burnish
his reputation as a leader.
It’s also to bolster
the perception
that France is the key middleman
between the United States
and Europe at a time when the
United Kingdom is grappling
with Brexit and Merkel is
struggling to hold onto power.
But those are intangibles.
On the harder issues
of policy, experts
say Macron's efforts
to try and sway
Trump on everything from the
Iran deal to climate change
have so far come up short.
