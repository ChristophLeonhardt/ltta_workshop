Neil: ALREADY ON THE COURT BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH ISN’T IN THE EYES OF SOME DEMOCRATS GOING TO STAY ON THE COURT. A NUMBER OF LEADING EFFORTS ESPECIALLY IF THEY GAIN THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE TO BEGIN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST HIM. GRAY THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL FOR RONALD REAGAN AND GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH EXPERT IN ALL THESE MATTERS. I DON’T SEE WHERE THAT WOULD GO. BUT WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD GO. I DON’T SEE WHERE IT WOULD GO EITHER. YOU CAN IMPEACH AND INDICTMENT. TRIAL IN THE SENATE. TAKES TWO THIRDS TO CONVICT. IT’S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HOW YOU COULD GET TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTE NOW AND ESPECIALLY IF THE VOTERS CAN PICK UP A SEAT OR TWO WHICH IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. I DON’T SEE WHERE IT GOES EXCEPT MORE EMBARRASSMENT, MORE, YOU KNOW, HARM TO THE COURT. AND IF THE INTENTION IS THE MEDIA AGAINST THE LEGITIMACY OF THE SUPREME COURT, THAT IS REALLY DANGEROUS IN MY VIEW. Neil: NOW, YOU DEALT WITH THIS, WHETHER CLARENCE THOMAS IN THE CAPACITY AS BEING AN ADVISOR TO HIM. AND HE ALWAYS HAD LIKE A TARGET ON HIM. AND I’M WONDERING DID THAT EVER DISSIPATE AFTER THOSE CONTROVERSIAL HEARINGS HE WAS APPROVED 52-48 IN THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE WE MIGHT POINT OUT. IT WAS TOOTH AND NAIL THE WHOLE BATTLE PROMISES LIKE IN THIS CASE TO MAKE HIM A MARKED MAN. I DON’T THINK IT WORKS. AND REMEMBER HE GOT 11 DEMOCRATIC VOTES. Neil: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN THING. I THINK HE SUFFERED SOMETHING OF A CLOUD FOR A FEW YEARS. IS HE NOW ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE COURT. HE IS KNOWN BY DEMOCRATIC SCHOLARS AS WELL AS REPUBLICAN OR CONSERVATIVE IF YOU WILL AS BEING ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE COURT. HE GOT TO MEN OFTEN WHEN THEY CAN’T REMEMBER WHAT THEY DECIDED 15 YEARS EARLIER IN A PARTICULAR CASE. IS HE ADORED BY HIS COLLEAGUES. AND HE IS ONE OF THE MOST FUN PEOPLE TO BE WITH AND IS HE VERY, VERY FUN EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN’T TALK. Neil: THAT’S RIGHT. I FORGOT ABOUT THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE HEARD ABOUT TRYING TO PURSUE IMPEACHMENT IS THAT THE JUDGE KAVANAUGH PERJURED HIMSELF. I’M NOT AN ALAWYER OR EXPERT ON THESE THINGS, YOU ARE. I STARTED TO DIGGING INTO THIS HOW PURGER HIMSELF. MINIMIZE HOW OFTEN HE GOT DRUNK IN HIGH SCHOOL. I’M THINKING TO MYSELF BOY, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT. MY GOSH, I THANK GOD I’M NEVER GOING TO BE QUESTIONED ABOUT MY DRINKING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. Neil: DON’T GO THERE WE DON’T WANT TO OPEN A CAN OF WORMS. THAT’S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN. TO SAY THAT’S WHERE HE WAS NOT VERY HONEST OR FORTHCOMING ABOUT SOMETHING HE WAS DOING IN HIGH SCHOOL. WELL, I GOT THE IMPRESSION, LISTENING TO THE HEARINGS WITHOUT THE COMMENTARY THAT HE LIKED BEER AND HE DRANK A LOT. I NEVER HAD ANY DIFFERENT VIEW. HE LIKED TO DRINK. AND THAT HAPPENINGS TO PEOPLE IN COLLEGE. IT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND, YOU KNOW, MOST OF US GROW OUT OF IT BUT I CAN’T SAY THAT I WOULD BE IN THE SAME PICKLE IS HE IN IF I WERE IN HIS SHOES. BECAUSE I CAN’T MAKE A RELATIVE JUDGMENT ABOUT MY OWN DRINKING WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE ANDY SOME THINGS THAT I REGRET TODAY. AND WOULDN’T DO AGAIN. AND HAVE DONE EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE THAT MY ONE DAUGHTER DOESN’T DO, HASN’T DONE. Neil: YOU KNOW, I SEE A METHOD TO THIS. AGAIN, NO LEGAL EXPERTISE, THAT’S WHY I’M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE CREATE DOUBTS HIS AUTHENTICITY UNDER OATH THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MISSTATE OR BLACKED OUT AFTER FALLEN ASLEEP THEREBY MAKING POSSIBLE THE CLAIMS OF DR. FORD. I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GETTING AT HERE. IT DOES SEEM A STRETCH AND MAYBE A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO USE THAT AS PRECEDENT IN FUTURE, YOU KNOW, SUPREME COURT PICKS AND WILL GO THAT FAR BACK AND ASK THOSE TYPE OF QUESTIONS. I THINK THAT’S A VERY DANGEROUS ROUTE TO TAKE. IF THEY DO THAT THEY OPEN UP THEY TAKE A RISK THAT I WOULDN’T TAKE IF I WERE THEY. THEY OPEN UP DE BLASIO HERSELF TO THE SAME KIND OF SCRUTINY. I’M NOT SURE SHE COMES OUT WELL IF SHE IS PUT UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT THE WAY THEY MIGHT DO TO HIM. SO, WHAT IS NEEDED BY THE COUNTRY IS SOME SORT OF, YOU KNOW, ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS, YOU WON. LET BY GONES BE BY GONES. WE WILL SEE YOU IN COURT ON ANOTHER DAY AND LET’S ACCEPT THIS OUTCOME AND, YOU KNOW, GET TOGETHER BECAUSE THE COURT IS ONE OF THE PRIZED
