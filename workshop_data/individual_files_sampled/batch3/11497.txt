Iran's military chief says the civil unrest which has blighted the country for a week is now over but it's come at a cost of at least 21 lives as protests repeatedly turned violent and there were still reports of small demonstrations last last night the unrest originally began is working-class movement against climbing living standards and unemployment as Iran's economy continues to stagnate but they widened into anti-government rallies US leaders were quick to throw their support behind the protesters but as I see talking in our reports they damn played the key reason behind the unrest when they ask for a better economy when they asked for the government to spend money on their own country as opposed to terror exploits overseas or in other countries sure we would certainly death to how many you I matter I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna see that's why you're trying to trap me into something like that I'm not gonna go there that is not our that is not our policy but we hear what the Iranian people are saying poverty corruption and economic uncertainty have the potential to trigger protests the world over and they can quickly turn ugly but the International reaction to such unrest seems to depend on the country in question this is the precise picture of a long oppressed people rising up against their dictators in any country people can protest against high prices but whenever such demonstrations happen in our country opponents of the establishment come out and support them some Western leaders are barely able to contain their enthusiasm for regime change and are rushing to throw their weight behind the demonstrators we are now seeing an organic popular uprising organized organized by brave Iranian citizens on the largest scale since 2009 the great Iranian people have been repressed for many years they're hungry for food and for freedom along with human rights the wealth of Iran is been looted sign for change it is essential that Western powers Britain Britain take a lead role and back the Iranian people because it's only with their backing that the the Iranian people will feel secure and can go all the way and securing their freedom in the other produce regime but we've seen where this apparent pro-democracy fervor can lead the American president says he supports the protesters but these protests are not protests against the government these kinds of demonstrations happen in any country and they are against rising prices but each time these demonstrations happen we see that the authorities opponents use them for their own purposes the majority in Iran I believe wants evolution not revolution or upheaval Arab Spring style which has brought so much suffering elsewhere on the other hand the West seems oddly quiet about the massive rallies that are being held across Iran in support of the government the root of it is just economics it's the problem of youth unemployment I personally haven't been able to find a job for a long time but if people have a job they don't have any problem with the government of course most of Iran's economic problems are domestically generated but another reason why investment and thus new jobs have been slow in coming is that contrary to their obligations under the nuclear agreement Western countries notably the United States have not taken sufficient steps to facilitate normal financial flows when it comes to Iran the West says it's listening but clearly selectively as co-opting democracy for its own ends is a difficult habit to break a necessity tricking our RT London
