1
00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:14,375
>> THEY TRIED TO SCARE ME.

2
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:16,010
BUT IT GIVES ME POWER AND AWAY.

3
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:17,645
I LOVE HILLARY, I LOVE EVERYONE,

4
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:24,685
BUT THE CAMPAIGN DIDN'T MAKE ME

5
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:27,521
FEEL LIKE A GUY THAT COULD PLAY

6
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:28,489
CATCH WITH HIS SON.

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,957
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT ONE UP

8
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,693
AT THIS HAT ON AND IT MADE ME

9
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,128
FEEL LIKE SUPERMAN.

10
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,697
YOU MADE A SUPERMAN.

11
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:38,466
THAT'S MY FAVORITE SUPERHERO.

12
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,234
>> THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING.

13
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:45,473
>> I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

14
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:47,475
I LOVE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

15
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:51,278
>> THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING, THE

16
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:53,714
WORDS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE

17
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:54,915
OVAL OFFICE TODAY, CONNIE WEST

18
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:55,983
EXPRESSING HIS SUPPORT AMONG

19
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:56,417
OTHER THINGS.

20
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:57,451
THAT IS WHERE WE WILL START WITH

21
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:00,955
OUR PANEL.

22
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,690
JOSH CRUSH HOUR, POLITICAL

23
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:04,458
EDITOR FOR THE NATIONAL JOURNAL,

24
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,794
AMY WALTER, NASH MONITORED HER

25
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:08,162
FOR THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT

26
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:09,597
AND MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR

27
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:14,468
EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST.

28
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:15,936
SO WHAT DOES THAT DO?

29
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:18,272
IT WAS A SURREAL MOMENT ON TV,

30
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:19,907
WE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

31
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:20,708
THAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

32
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:23,344
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT DOES FOR

33
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:24,945
PRESIDENT TRUMP, OR THE ELECTION

34
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,113
IN ANY WAY?

35
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:28,182
>> IT CERTAINLY WAS A SURREAL

36
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:30,484
MOMENT.

37
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:31,652
PRESIDENT TRUMP LOVES CELEBRITY.

38
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:33,054
HE LOVED THE BEACH BOYS AND HAD

39
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,690
ANOTHER CELEBRITY IN THE

40
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:36,424
WHITE HOUSE TODAY BUT IT

41
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:38,159
REMINDED ME THAT IT COULD BE A

42
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,694
LOST OPPORTUNITY FOR

43
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:40,161
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

44
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:41,629
IF YOU FOCUSED ON THE CRIMINAL

45
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,296
JUSTICE REFORM WHICH WAS WHY

46
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:43,330
CONNIE WEST WAS AT THE

47
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:45,199
WHITE HOUSE AND THE FIRST PLACE,

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,701
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN

49
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:47,401
OPPORTUNITY EARLY ON IN HIS

50
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:48,903
PRESIDENCY TO EXPAND HIS

51
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:50,705
COALITION AND WENT OVER SOME

52
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:51,706
AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO THE TRUMP

53
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:52,339
SIDE.

54
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,307
IT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT WHERE

55
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:56,911
WE HAD ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS

56
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:57,712
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CELEBRITIES

57
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:58,479
HUGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT IT

58
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,747
FEELS LIKE IT'S LATE IN THE GAME

59
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:01,115
FOR THAT AND IT DOESN'T FEEL

60
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:02,917
LIKE THIS CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME

61
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:04,351
FOR THIS PRESIDENT.

62
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:05,352
THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME

63
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:06,854
OPPORTUNITIES AS WE GET CLOSER

64
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:08,456
TO THE MIDTERMS WERE TRYING TO

65
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:09,757
BUILD SOME NEW SUPPORTERS BUT I

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,226
DON'T THINK HE WILL MOVE A WHOLE

67
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:13,160
LOT POLITICALLY.

68
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:14,795
>> WHAT WAS INTERESTING, WHAT HE

69
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:16,697
JUST SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING

70
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:17,898
ABOUT PUTTING ON THAT GIVES HIM

71
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:18,365
POWER.

72
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,367
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING IN OUR

73
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:22,169
CULTURE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF

74
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,703
CRITICISM OF BEING A

75
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,605
CONSERVATIVE, A TON OF CRITICISM

76
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:25,806
FOR BEING A TRUMP SUPPORTER BUT

77
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:29,610
IF YOU CAN WITHSTAND THAT THERE

78
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:30,978
IS SOMETHING EMPOWERING ABOUT

79
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:31,245
IT.

80
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:32,646
KANYE IS INTERESTING AND HE IS

81
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:34,115
ALWAYS INTERESTING AND SAYS

82
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:35,549
THINGS IN A WEIRD WAY, BUT I

83
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,518
THINK THE REASON YOU ARE SEEING

84
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,086
SO MUCH NEGATIVE REACTION IS

85
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:40,354
BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT HE IS

86
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:41,122
RAISING.

87
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:42,523
YOU HAVE A VERY POPULAR

88
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,091
CELEBRITY ALIGNING HIMSELF WITH

89
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:46,193
THE PRESIDENT AND THERE'S

90
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:48,095
SOMETHING VERY ALARMING ABOUT

91
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:48,863
THAT.

92
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:51,098
YOU SEE TONS OF HISPANIC

93
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:51,866
SUPPORTING TED CRUZ, TONS OF

94
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,969
HISPANICS SUPPORTING DEAN

95
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,302
KELLER.

96
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,071
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

97
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:58,506
FEEL VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WHEN

98
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,007
PEOPLE DO NOT PLAY THE PARTS

99
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,442
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.

100
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:03,778
>> TO THAT POINT, SOME OTHER

101
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:04,645
COMMENTATORS WEIGHING IN ON WHAT

102
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:07,915
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY WITH

103
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,315
KANYE WEST.

104
00:03:08,316 --> 00:03:10,785
>> KANYE WEST IS WHAT HAPPENS

105
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:11,919
WHEN DON'T READ IT.

106
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,820
>> BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

107
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:18,058
BECAUSE HE PUT ON A HAT AND --

108
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,794
HE'S ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW THE

109
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:22,396
MODEL SPOKESPERSON OR TOKEN OF

110
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:24,298
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?

111
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,900
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE THAT

112
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,935
LIBERALS TRY TO DO, LIBERALS TRY

113
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:29,637
TO CONTROL THE BLACK PERSON TO

114
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:30,504
THE CONCEPT OF RACISM BECAUSE

115
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:32,740
THEY KNOW WE ARE VERY PROUD OF,

116
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:33,240
EMOTIONAL PEOPLE.

117
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,576
SO WHEN I SAY I LIKE TRUMP TO

118
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,678
SOMEONE THAT'S A LIBERAL, THEY

119
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,713
SAY, HE'S RACIST.

120
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:42,516
YOU THINK RACISM CAN CONTROL ME?

121
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:43,417
THAT DOESN'T STOP ME.

122
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:44,885
>> Bret: IT'S SUCH AN

123
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:48,088
EXPLOSIVE THING TO TALK ABOUT.

124
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,290
BUT HOW DOES THIS PLAY?

125
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,125
>> I JUST THINK WE ARE BACK

126
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:53,360
WHERE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN, AND

127
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,529
THE DISCUSSION OF TWO AMERICAS

128
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,735
AND A POLARIZED AMERICA, AND I

129
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,770
DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME

130
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,804
TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE

131
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,674
THOUGHT WERE GOING TO GET RAISE

132
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:07,408
RAISED, AND KIM KARDASHIAN AND

133
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:08,676
HIS WIFE OF COURSE CAME IN AND

134
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:12,646
ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT ISSUES

135
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:13,781
RELATED TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE

136
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:14,114
REFORM.

137
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:17,618
INSTEAD, THIS BECOMES ABOUT WHO

138
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:21,288
HIS TEAM ARE YOU ON.

139
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,557
THE ENTIRE TRUMP PRESIDENCY HAS

140
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:24,558
BEEN BASICALLY ABOUT PICKING HER

141
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,894
ASIDE AND PICKING OUR TEAM, AND

142
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:29,730
FOR KANYE TO PUT THE RED HAT ON,

143
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:31,398
HE IS LITERALLY SAYING I'M GOING

144
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,133
AGAINST MY TEAM AND THERE IS A

145
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:34,235
BACKLASH TO THAT, IN THE SAME

146
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:38,505
WAY THAT REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE

147
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,707
SAID -- OR WHO WERE NORMALLY

148
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,109
READY TO GO INTO THE BLUE TEAM,

149
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,111
THEY GET THE CRITICISM FOR DOING

150
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:44,712
THAT.

151
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:47,481
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT, THERE

152
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:50,284
IS -- THE ELECTION WILL JUST

153
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:53,687
FURTHER GET US INTO THESE DEEP,

154
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:56,290
DEEP, POLAR -- >> AND WE'VE BEEN

155
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,092
TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE.

156
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:01,228
>> EARLIER THIS MORNING,

157
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:01,996
DONALD TRUMP CALLED INTO FOX AND

158
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:05,866
FRIENDS AND HAD A LENGTHY

159
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:06,667
CONVERSATION.

160
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:09,503
>> SHE WAS REFERENCING CONNIE'S

161
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:09,904
APPEARANCE.

162
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,505
>> KIM CAME TO THE OVAL OFFICE

163
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,507
AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY VERY

164
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:14,375
EFFECTIVE AT GETTING THAT

165
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,342
SENTENCE COMMUTED.

166
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:16,410
BUT THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT

167
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,144
PEOPLE ARE HAVING NOW AND IT'S

168
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:19,113
GOOD TO SEE THEM ON THE RIGHT

169
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:20,915
BECAUSE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM

170
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,916
HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT

171
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:22,983
PREVIOUSLY JUST PEOPLE ON THE

172
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:24,118
LEFT WERE TALKING ABOUT.

173
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:26,487
YOU SEE A LOT OF GOOD TO

174
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,855
ELEMENTS WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT

175
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:29,723
MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND HOW WE

176
00:05:29,724 --> 00:05:31,759
ADJUDICATE VARIOUS CASES.

177
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,327
AND IT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF

178
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:33,627
THIS.

179
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:34,929
>> THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO

180
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,932
THIS IS SITTING IN HIS CABINET

181
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:38,565
AND THAT'S JEFF SESSIONS.

182
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,034
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PASS THIS

183
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,969
AND HAVE ENOUGH VOTES IN SENATE

184
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,403
TO PASS THIS.

185
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:43,771
BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THE

186
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:46,040
REAL REASON WHY A LOT OF THE

187
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,242
STUFF ISN'T GETTING DONE.

188
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:49,843
>> Bret: LET ME TURN TO THE

189
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:52,646
BIG INTERNATIONAL STORY,

190
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:53,347
DISMISSING SAUDI JOURNALISTS.

191
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:55,316
LET'S SEE HOW THE U.S. IS

192
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:56,283
DEALING WITH IT.

193
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:57,785
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT IT VERY

194
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,520
STRONGLY AND WE WILL HAVE A

195
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,754
REPORT OUT SOON.

196
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:02,923
WE ARE WORKING WITH TURKEY AND

197
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:03,357
SAUDI ARABIA.

198
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,926
WHAT HAPPENED WAS A TERRIBLE

199
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:07,962
THING, ASSUMING THAT HAPPENED.

200
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:08,896
MAYBE WE WILL BE PLEASANTLY

201
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:11,131
SURPRISED BUT SOMEHOW I DOUBT

202
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:11,699
IT.

203
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,234
>> I TALKED TO SENATOR CORKER

204
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:17,304
AND CARDIN AND THERE WILL BE A

205
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:18,706
BIPARTISAN TSUNAMI BILL AGAINST

206
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:19,740
SAUDI ARABIA HERE, IF THEY DID

207
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,375
IN FACT DO THIS.

208
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,777
>> IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE

209
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:25,512
LEFT ALIVE AND IT'S TIME FOR THE

210
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:27,381
UNITED STATES TO LAY DOWN SOME

211
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:29,149
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SAUDIS.

212
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,453
>> Bret: THIS IS THE

213
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:33,053
DISAPPEARANCE OF JAMAAL

214
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:33,487
KHASHOGGI AND

215
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,688
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND

216
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:39,727
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES ARE SAYING

217
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:49,503
THAT HE ORDERED THE ACTION.

218
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:50,738
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH WHAT HAS

219
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,706
BEEN AN IMPROVING RELATIONSHIP

220
00:06:52,707 --> 00:06:53,307
WITH THE KINGDOM.

221
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:55,075
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT THE

222
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:55,876
WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO WANT AND

223
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,111
I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY THE

224
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,979
PRESIDENT'S PASSIVITY AND NOT

225
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,880
REALLY CALLING OUT SAUDI ARABIA.

226
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:01,448
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL

227
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,984
MORE FACTS BECOME AVAILABLE BUT,

228
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:04,685
LIKE A LOT OF FOREIGN POLICY

229
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:06,720
ISSUES YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT

230
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:08,222
EATING FROM BEHIND TO COME AT

231
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,290
THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.

232
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,126
HE SAW LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MARCO

233
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,093
RUBIO, SOME OF THE HOCKS ON THE

234
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:14,828
SENATE SIDE THAT WANT ACTION.

235
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,664
THEY MIGHT WANT SANCTIONS, BUT

236
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,700
THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T WANT TO

237
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,300
DO THAT.

238
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,302
JARED KUSHNER HAS HAD A CLOSE

239
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:23,070
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SAUDI

240
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,139
LEADERSHIP AND I THINK THEY HAVE

241
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,575
A LOT AT STAKE AND THEY DON'T

242
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,310
WANT TO JEOPARDIZE THAT.

243
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:32,513
>> I THINK THE MESSAGE TODAY

244
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,281
WAS, LET'S SEE WHERE THIS TAKES

245
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,917
US, WHERE WE KNOW TO BE FACTS.

246
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:37,684
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS INTELLIGENCE

247
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,686
THAT WE ARE NOT SEEN.

248
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:41,522
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO

249
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:44,091
SAY, HOW ARE WE GOING TO KNOW

250
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:46,527
ACTUALLY, WILL HE FEEL LIKE IT

251
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:48,695
IS A VERY DEFINITIVE CASE THAT

252
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:52,299
CAN BE TOLD?

253
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,001
WE MAY GET MORE INTELLIGENT, BUT

254
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:56,503
IF SO THE ACTION WOULD BE AS

255
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,305
JOSH POINTED OUT THAT THING THAT

256
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,074
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY HESITANT

257
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:00,741
TO DO.

258
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:03,777
WHICH IS STOP ARMS SALES TO

259
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:04,511
SAUDI ARABIA.

260
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:06,447
YOU COULD HAVE A REALLY

261
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:11,518
TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAUDI

262
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,286
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT THEY ARE

263
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,422
DOING RIGHT NOW, THEIR PLACE IN

264
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:18,492
THE WORLD MILITARILY IF THE U.S.

265
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:19,760
DID PUT SANCTIONS ON SOON.

266
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,929
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY MUCH

267
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,330
JUMPING THE GUN.

268
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,431
BOTH TURKEY AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE

269
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:25,365
ALLIES AND THEY HAVE THE HUMAN

270
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:28,869
RIGHTS PROBLEMS.

271
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,436
TURKEY'S PRESIDENT HAS

272
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:32,539
IMPRISONED SOMETHING NORTH OF

273
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,806
160 JOURNALISTS -- THE IDEA THAT

274
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:34,475
YOU WOULD JUST TAKE THEM AT

275
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:35,943
THEIR WORD, THAT THEY KNOW

276
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,810
EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON SEEMS

277
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:39,913
REALLY PREMATURE.

278
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:40,848
WHEN YOU ARE MAKING DECISIONS

279
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,516
ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH ALLIES,

280
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:44,918
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE FOCUSED ON

281
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,919
YOUR NATIONAL INTEREST.

282
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
KIDNAPPING OR KILLING A

283
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,522
JOURNALIST IS A HORRIBLE THING.

284
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:50,858
IT HAPPENS A LOT, IT'S NOT WORSE

285
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,659
IF IT HAPPENS TO A JOURNALIST

286
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,094
AND SOMEONE ELSE BUT YOU STILL

287
00:08:54,095 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT
