WE HAVE A STORY OF THE ROUTINE ABUSE OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN FLORIDA BY THEIR EMPLOYERS THAT WILL PROBABLY MAKE YOUR BLOOD BOIL, AND IT'S HAPPENING AT A MASS SCALE. THIS INFORMATION COMES AS THE RESULT OF A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION BY THE NAPLES DAILY NEWS, AND FIRST HERE'S A CASE STUDY IN HOW THIS FUNCTIONS SO WHEN YOU GET INJURED ON THE JOB, AS HAPPENS, BECAUSE MANY JOBS, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION JOBS, ARE DANGEROUS, THEY WILL IN CAST YOU OFF. IF YOU THEN TRY TO GET HELP FROM EFFECTIVELY THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH STILL INVOLVES YOUR EMPLOYER, THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO GET YOU DEPORTED. IT'S DAMNED IF YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU DON'T. NOW NOT ALLEGEDLY, THEY DO THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS, YOU HAVE THE CASE STUDY, HOW MANY CASES ARE THERE? WELL I WONDER WHO IS TURNING THEM IN, I CAN'T QUITE TELL. OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE BREAKING THE LAW BY PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION BUT THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE EMPLOYER TO VERIFY. THEY ARE WILLINGLY CLOSING THEIR EYES AND HIRING PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE THEN BOUGHT THEMSELVES NOT REALLY ANY LEGAL LIABILITY BUT JUST A LEGAL OUT WHERE THEY GET THE PERSON DEPORTED AND DON'T HAVE TO PAY. UNDERSTAND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO FIND OUT FOR SURE THAT YOU ARE LEGAL, BUT SO THEY ARE DOING THIS, BUT THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY FACING ANY LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR THEIR ACTIONS. ALSO CLEARLY THEY AREN'T ABIDING BY THAT LAW EITHER. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS WORKS IN CAHOOTS TO SCREW OVER WORKERS YET AGAIN. THERE ARE NO PROSECUTIONS OF THINGS THAT ARE CLEARLY GOING ON, WHICH IS HIRING WORKERS YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HIRING. IF YOU ARE A RIGHT-WINGER AND YOU DON'T LIKE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND GETTING THESE JOBS, YOU SHOULD BE FURIOUS AT THOSE BUSINESSES. THAT'S THE MAIN THING YOU TALK ABOUT, OH MY GOD, THEY ARE TAKING MY JOBS. THE GUYS WHO ARE HIRING THEM INSTEAD OF YOU ARE DOING THIS, SO YOU SHOULD BE FURIOUS AT THOSE BUSINESSES. SECONDARILY, THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS IT AND THEY DON'T CARE, THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, YOU SHOULD BE FURIOUS ABOUT THAT. AND IF YOU THINK, OBAMA IT'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS. FLORIDA IS RUN BY REPUBLICANS FOR HOW MANY YEARS NOW? THEY PURPOSELY AREN'T ENFORCING IT BECAUSE THEY GET PAID OFF BY THE BUSINESS INTERESTS. IF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN, GOVERNMENT IS CORRUPT, I HEAR YOU, BROTHER. WHO DO YOU THINK CORRUPTED THEM? BUSINESSES LIKE THIS. THEN THEY TURN AROUND AND THEY GO, I GUESS YOU ARE HIRING ALL LEGAL WORKERS. OH YES WE ARE. AND OF COURSE THEY TURN AROUND, YOU GOT INJURED AND I WILL HAVE TO PAY YOU SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU ALMOST CUT YOUR FINGER OFF? AND INSTEAD OF BEING A HUMAN BEING AND CARING ABOUT YOU, SOMEONE I WORK WITH EVERY DAY, I WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE AND SAY YOU DEAL WITH YOUR AMPUTATED FINGER OR WHATEVER IT IS, HEART ATTACK, ALL THE CASES ARE DIFFERENT INJURIES, I DON'T CARE, AND FACT I WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE. GOLLY GEE, I JUST FOUND OUT HE'S UNDOCUMENTED, I HAVE TO TURN HIM IN. IT TOOK AN INJURY TO PAY ATTENTION. AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT GOES, YOU ARE RIGHT, THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT. AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU ARE REPORTING ALL THESE CASES OF A DOCUMENT WORKERS I WON'T INVESTIGATE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE ON STAFF RIGHT NOW. I WILL ONLY ENFORCE IT AGAINST THE PEOPLE YOU TOLD ME TO FIRE BECAUSE THEY ARE COSTING YOU MONEY. NOT FIRE BUT LITERALLY RUN OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
