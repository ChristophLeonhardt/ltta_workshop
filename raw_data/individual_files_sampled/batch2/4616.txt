so I'm still baffled there was a surprise settlement today of a civil lawsuit brought by one woman who says she was paid off before the election to not talk about her affair with Donald Trump Karen McDougal says she has a had a 10 month long affair with the president she was paid 150 grand right before the election by a Trump friendly media company to effectively not tell her story about mr. Trump that media company and Karen McDougal just surprised tonight settled their civil lawsuit lawsuit has gone away it's interesting on its own terms but then there's also the fact that the the terms of that payoff to her are also now part of the criminal investigation into the president's lawyer by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York so I have we've heard from the lawyer involved in settling this case we've heard his take on it I've heard his argument about it I have legal questions that remain though if the criminal investigation and this civil lawsuit were about the same thing is it important that the civil lawsuit just went away is that a strange thing doesn't matter for the criminal investigation here particularly because it looks like the criminal investigation here is a serious thing both for the president's lawyer and potentially for the President himself joining us now is Chuck Rosenberg's former US attorney former senior FBI official Chuck thank you very much for being here much appreciate it thanks for having me um you saw my interview there with mr. stress I did so the FBI has raided Michael Cohen's home and office am I said that it would fight Karen MacDougall's lawsuit right up until today when they settle this follows the raid this follows threats that there would be they'd start to enter into discovery in this civil suit what do you make of that that timing in this dynamic between the two cases can I answer you in the abstract oh yeah a bank gets robbed and you find a guy down the street holding a bag of money and covered in dye pack ink coincidence maybe but probably not it's probably the bank robber so is this a coincidence that they would dismiss the suit or settle the suit right after Cohn's office got raided I don't think so I'm not a big believer in coincidences and so what about the raid would have pushed this to settlement well a couple of things but probably first and foremost whatever is gonna come out in the civil suit is going to be influenced by the fact that there's a parallel ongoing criminal investigation and so folks who might have been deposed or might have been inclined to speak in connection with the civil suit may now be taking the theft for instance it would plead the fifth so they don't face exposure and that other thing that matters a lot more that's ongoing it also just complicates the lives of the attorneys in the civil matter I don't blame I don't know what miss MacDougall's goals where I take mr. stris that is worried good enough right not for us I guess to decide but from mr. Cohen's vantage point from the folks at AMI why they just want this whole thing to go away they can't do that they can't make the federal prosecutors go away yeah but they could at least make this piece of it go away when I was thinking just about what you know what might be the explosive evidence in this case if it's a worst-case scenario for the people involved and there is this prospect that with discovery in the civil lawsuit that could have resulted and it would have been litigated right but it could have resulted in the media company and am I having the hand over any of their own communications and documents that led to this agreement with Ms McDougald house if this payment to Ms mcdougal is of interest to prosecutors who are pursuing this is a criminal matter is there any reason why they can't get that stuff from am I to no reason at all in fact Rachel they're gonna get all this stuff and probably more than would have come out in civil discovery so nothing about this settlement undermines or undercuts the work that the federal agents and federal prosecutors are going to do okay they get this stuff they get to put people in the grand jury we've seen from other indictments in the Mahler case for instance how good federal prosecutors are at following the money they're gonna follow the money okay that's the key issue here I guess for me on on this issue then of the criminal case I haven't had a chance yet to ask you what you make of the jurisdiction issues here obviously this is described as this matter with involving criminal Cohen is described as something that started with a referral from the special councils office to the prosecutors in New York I'm not I I get that that's how it happened I'm still not quite sure how unusual that is or how important that is what's your take on that dynamic not that unusual so there's 94 US Attorneys offices around the country but we're all part of the same system right we all rely on the FBI or the ATF or the DEA to bring us cases and so when we're working well we're working together and if I see something that happened in the district of Minnesota were in the den in Tulsa Oklahoma me sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia as a federal prosecutor would hand that piece off by the way that doesn't preclude it from coming back all right if the folks in the Southern District of New York say hey you know what we've found three things and two of them seem to be ours but one of them seems like it would fit what Bob Muller is doing they can kick it back they can kick it back Chuck Rosenberg former US attorney former senior FBI official invaluable asset to us here Thank You Chuck my pleasure too much more ahead tonight stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
