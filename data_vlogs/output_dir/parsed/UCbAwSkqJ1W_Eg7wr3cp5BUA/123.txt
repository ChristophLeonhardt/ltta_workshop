pilgrimage complete look at Tyler's
we're always like looking at ours okay I
got your frozen yes
this little potato this little potato is
trying to come inside look at him look
at his audacity oh now he's etching all
right so before we are done with our
Valentine's date we're gonna watch the
game of Thrones trailer and see what
happens okay so they're in the Hall of
faces Houseman guy dot dot dot whose
face will it be no no they're just
messing with us no way John's dead I
don't believe it for a second well did
they just tease it everyone's gonna die
well I think that they're trying to say
that the White Walkers come then
everyone would die right I actually
think that the fact that everyone's face
was there means that John's not dead I
think so too actually so also they feel
like bathed their bodies and cut off
their faces for them all right you know
I think that's the end of our
Valentine's Day adventures thank you so
much for watching and happy Valentine's
Day
look at this little potato all right he
cannot handle it
