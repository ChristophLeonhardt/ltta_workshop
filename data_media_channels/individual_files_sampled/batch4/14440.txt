new numbers on the economy and of course they're great more of that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel poor liberals they just can't seem to catch a break when it comes to the economy on top of the great news that came out last Friday regarding GDP growth and I will get to that in a minute CNBC just released some new numbers regarding confidence in our president and his handling of our economy kind of what we hired him for CNBC ran a poll of top economist money managers and strategists and found that 59% of them approved now it's a startling admission by a network who is not necessarily the harshest critic harshest critic of this president but certainly not one of his supporters and liberals will say but the tariffs that the tariffs Wow well according to these top money guys they project that the current bash of tariffs will only reduce our annual growth by about one tenth of one percent now this is coming on the heels of great news from last Friday as you all know a rising tide lifts all ships 4.1 percent GDP growth and liberals are predictably pissed liberals were actually hoping that the tide would recede they hate this president so much that frankly they would rather your ship be lost out at sea than for this president to succeed now these GDP numbers are really no surprise to me or people who study conservative policies and its effect on the economy the policies that President Trump has enacted should lead to this type of growth now the growth is attributed to an increase in consumer spending exports federal and local spending business investment tariffs can probably take credit for at least 1% of the growth consumer spending in conjunction with narrowing the trade deficit is also a very very large part of it too also tax cuts and regulatory reform of course and to put it in layman's terms Americans are paying less in taxes but because unemployment has dropped so drastically you have more Americans who are paying taxes so the federal government is actually taking in more money because people are back to work again after years and years of high unemployment rates under Obama speaking of Obama let's talk about him his highest numbers for GDP growth never rose above 2.6 percent the average over his eight years was 2.2 percent we are now at almost 200 percent or doubled out we've got 9.3 percent export growth which is incredible considering the tariffs that were imposed we're also importing only half a percent because the America first agenda made in the USA made in America is something that people are valuing a lot more lately people are proud to buy American again and you know what it's only gonna get better I would not be surprised if q3 numbers are even better which pretty much sucks for Democrats because those numbers are going to come out 11 days before midterms so all fantastic news great job on the economy president Trump thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rubble subscribe to our premium content at WWWE a forward slash OHS make sure you're following us on Facebook and Twitter for all of our latest news and download our new app for the rebel media that way you will have instant access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
