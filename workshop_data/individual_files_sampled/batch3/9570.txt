BRETT KAVANAUGH FIRING BACK AGAINST SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH FOX NEWS. YOU WILL HEAR FROM HIM IN A MOMENT. BUT FIRST, WE WANT TO GET YOU CAUGHT UP. THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BLASTING WHAT HE IS CALLING A LAST MINUTE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WHILE ADDING HE WON’T BE SMEARED AND INTIMIDATED INTO WITHDRAWALLING. THIS COMES AS A SECOND ACCUSER HAS COME FORWARD ACCUSING KAVANAUGH OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DURING A PARTY WHEN THEY WERE STUDENTS AT YALE. THE WOMAN IDENTIFIED AS DEBBIE RAMIREZ IS ADMITTING TO "THE NEW YORKER" SHE IS NOT CERTAIN IT WAS KAVANAUGH AT FIRST AND ACKNOWLEDGES THERE ARE GAPS IN HER MEMORY OF THE EVENING BECAUSE SHE WAS DRINKING. THE AUTHOR WHO COWROTE THE PIECE EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT THE UNCORROBORATED CLAIMS. AT FIRST SHE WASN’T SURE IT WAS KAVANAUGH, WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO HER LAST WEEK. YOU WRITE AFTER SIX DAYS OF MEMORIES AND CONSULTING CONSULTN MEMORIES AND CONSULTING CONSULTG MEMORIES AND CONSULTING CONSULTW MEMORIES AND CONSULTING CONSULTT CAREFULLY ASSESSING HER MEMORIES AND CONSULTING CONSULTH MEMORIES AND CONSULTING CONSULTH HER ATTORNEY SHE BECAME CONFIDENT IT WAS HIM. GEORGE, THAT IS EXTREMELY TYPICAL OF THE STORIES. WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH TRAUMA, ALCOHOL, MANY YEARS IN BETWEEN. I THINK THE MORE CAUTIOUS WITNESSES I HAVE DEALT WITH IN CASES LIKE THIS, VERY FREQUENTLY SAY, "I WANT TO TAKE TIME TO DECIDE, I WANT TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED. I WANT TO SEARCH MYSELF AND MAKE SURE THAT I CAN AFFIRMATIVELY STAND BY THE CLAIMS." Jesse: FARROW CAUSING CONTROVERSY WHEN EXPLAINING WHY MS. RAMIREZ DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT NOW. SHE CAME FORWARD BECAUSE SENATE DEMOCRATS BEGAN LOOKING AT THE CLAIM. THIS CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF PEOPLE ON THE HILLED INDEPENDENTLY. IT HAS CORNERED HER TO AWKWARD POSITION. SHE TOOK TIME TO TO THINK ABOUT IT CAREFULLY. SHE SAID, "I DON’T WANT TO RUIN ANYBODY’S LIFE" BUT SHE FEELS THIS IS A SERIOUS CLAIM AND CONSIDERS HER MEMORIES CREDIBLE AND FELT SHE WAS FORCED TO TELL HER STORY. Jesse: THIS IS WHAT WAS SAID IN THE EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW MARTHA MacCALLUM TONIGHT. THE TRUTH IS I HAVE NEVER ASSAULTED ANYONE IN HIGH SCHOOL OR OTHERWISE. I AM NOT QUESTIONING OR HAVE NOT QUESTIONED THAT PERHAPS DR. FORD WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT SOME POINT AT ANY POINT IN SOME PLACE BUT I KNOW I HAVE NEVER SEXUAL ASSAULTED ANYONE. Jesse: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PROCESS OF WHICH THE WOMAN’S STORY CAME OUT? SHE IS REACHED BY THE SENATE DEMOCRAT STAFFERS AND THEN, I BELIEVE, MAYBE SHE IS COACHED OR MASSAGED BY LAWYERS AND DEMOCRAT ACTIVISTS TO REMEMBERING WHAT SHE BELIEVES WAS A SEXUAL MISCONDUCT SITUATION, ABOUT 35 YEARS AGO. DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS STRANGE AT ALL? YOU KNOW WHAT STRIKES ME AT STRANGE THAT YOU HAVE FARROW WHO HAD A GOOD REPUTATION, WHO NOW COMES OUT AND SAYS WELL, YOU KNOW, BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, IT’S NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. YOU’RE WRONG. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, 35 YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, CREATING A SEX CRIMES UNIT, TRYING RAPE CASES, LISTENING TO COMPLAINTS YOU DON’T HAVE SOMEONE SAY I NEED SIX DAYS TO FIGURE OUT WHO IT WAS. AND THEN NEEDS TO CONSULT WITH THEIR ATTORNEY. THEY USUALLY AT THAT POINT IF THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR MISCONDUCT, THEY KNOW WHO DID IT. AND THE SIX DAYS ARE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND TELL THE STORY. SHE SAYS SHE CAME OUT WITH IT BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO TELL HER STORY BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES. THE BOTTOM LINE. IF YOU CAN’T FIND A CORROBORATING WITNESS TO CONFIRM WHAT YOU ARE ALLEGING WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHO ELSE ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT TELLING YOUR STORY BECAUSE THERE IS NO STORY. BUT I CAN START WITH DUE PROCESS. NOWHERE NEAR THE DELAYED DEMOCRAT COMPLAINTS. Jesse: SO JUAN, IF YOU HAVE NO WITNESSES TO THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT AND THEN YOU WERE CALLING AROUND SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS BACK AT YALE ON THE PHONE AND SAYING, "YOU KNOW WHAT? IT MAY HAVE BEEN KAVANAUGH, IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN KAVANAUGH. DO YOU THINK IT WAS KAVANAUGH? I CAN’T QUITE REMEMBER." THEN ANOTHER FEMALE ASSOCIATE, HER BEST FRIEND SAYS SHE NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. DOES THIS TELL YOU THAT MAYBE SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE IT EXACTLY RIGHT ABOUT SPECIFICALLY KAVANAUGH? Juan: YEAH, IT DOES. I THINK THAT SHE IS SAYING OF HER OWN VOLITION SHE WANTS TO BE SURE. THAT SHE THINKS IT’S SUCH A SERIOUS ALLEGATION SHE TOOK TIME AND SHE IS PUTTING ALL OF YOUR DOUBTS OUT IN PUBLIC. SHE IS NOT TRYING TO SAY OH, I’M CERTAIN WHEN SHE IS NOT CERTAIN. SHE IS SAYING I’M NOT CLEARLY CERTAIN. I WAS DRINKING. SO I THINK THAT IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. RONIN FARROW SAYS HE CONSIDERS WHAT HE DID HIGH LEVEL OF EVIDENCE. I’M QUOTING. AND SAYS THAT DIRECT ACCOUNT FROM PEOPLE SHE TOLD RIGHT AFTERWARD THIS HAPPENED WITH KAVANAUGH. THAT IS WHAT FARROW SAYS. HE SAYS HE APPLIED THAT IN OTHER STORIES OF SIMILAR INSTANCES OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND SAYS IT HAS PROVEN TO BE IRONCLAD AND A GOOD WAY TO DO IT AND HE CONSIDERS THIS IS A HIGH STANDARD OF JOURNALISM. Jesse: I DIDN’T KNOW THAT IS THE WAY HE WENT ABOUT IT. THOUGHT HE FOUND SOMEONE WHO HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAD HAPPENED. NOT THAT THIS WOMAN HAD TOLD A FRIEND ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS. Lisa: THE PIECE SAYS THEY HAVE NOT CONFIRMED WITH OTHER EYEWITNESSES THAT KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT AT THE PARTY. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REACHED OUT TO SEVERAL DOZEN INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO CORROBORATE THE STORY AND COULD. NO AND EVEN REPORTED THAT RAMIREZ HERSELF WAS CALLING TO ASK IF THEY COULD RECALL THIS FROM HAPPENING. THIS IS PRETTY CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHAT IS GOING ON NOW. THE #MeToo MOVEMENT CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE COERCED TO SIMPLY BELIEVE A WOMAN BECAUSE OF HER GENDER. DEMOCRATS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE, MANIPULATING THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND NOW WEAPONIZING THE UNCORROBORATED ACCUSATIONS AS A POLITICAL TOOL TO CLOBBER JUDGE KAVANAUGH WITH. IT’S DISINGENUOUS AND DANGEROUS. FRANKLY, THE "NEW YORKER" SHOULD BE ASHAMED THEY RAN THE STORY TO BEGIN WITH. Jesse: GREG, IF YOU LOOK BACK TO THE WEEKEND. ONE OF THE ALLEGED WITNESSES WITH DR. FORD, FEMALE, GOOD FRIEND, CAME OUT AND SAID I NEVER HEARD OF THIS. NOT SURE ABOUT THE PARTY. DON’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. THEN YOU HAVE A SECOND AD VICTIM COME OUT ALLEGED VICTIM COME OUT. WHAT DOES THE PATTERN TELL YOU NOW? Greg: DIANNE FEINSTEIN COULD RUN AN AIRLINE WITH THAT KIND OF TIMING. I WAS PERFECTLY TIMED. YOU HAVE A LONG-TIME FRIEND, FOURTH PERSON IN THE STORY WITH NO RECOLLECTION. BOOM! IT WAS A SATURDAY. SUNDAY YOU HAD NEW ACCUSATION. WHAT WORRIES ME IN THE BIG PICTURE WE ARE SHIFTING THE MEANING OF THE WORD "CORROBORATION" BEFORE AN ACCUSATION WOULD REQUIRE COLLABORATION, WHICH MEANT WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE WHICH THE FORD CASE SEEMED TO LOOK. NOW THIS OTHER ONE SEEMS WEAKER THAN FORD. SO YOU CORROBORATE ONE ALLEGATION WITH WHAT? ANOTHER ALLEGATION. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MEDIA IS LESS INCLINED TO DIVE DEEP IN THE STORY. INSTEAD JUST PILE WELL, IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE NOW IT’S QUANTITY NOT QUALITY. THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL POINT. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY CAREER OVER THREE DECADES. I’VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY REPRESSED MEMORY CASES IN MY LIFE. ESPECIALLY AGAINST ONE GUY. Greg: YEAH. SO THE QUESTION IS, IF THERE IS SOMETHING AWRY GOING ON, WAS THERE HYPNOSIS? ARE THEY USING CONFABLATION? I DON’T WANT TO GET IN THE WEEDS HERE. BUT THIS IS THE THING THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO TRUE CROSS EXAMINATION. THE DEMOCRATS DON’T WANT TRUE CROSS EXAMINATION. THEY WANT KAVANAUGH TO GO FIRST. HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT OR THE ACCUSED GO FIRST WHEN HE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT THE ACCUSATION IS? HOW IS IT THE DEFENDANT ABLE TO REBUT AND PRESENT A DEFENSE WHEN THE COMPLAINING WITNESS DOESN’T GIVE A BILL OF PARTICULARS AS TO WHAT HAPPENED? I MEAN THIS IS SO BACKWARDS. IT’S SO OBVIOUSLY AN ATTEMPT Juan: LET’S GO WITH WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. GOOD. Juan: LET’S HAVE THE F.B.I. SHE IS OKAY WITH THAT. Juan: HAVE THE F.B.I. COME IN AND SAY HERE IS A FACT BASIS THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE CALLING FOR. SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS, JUAN. Juan: NO, LET ME JUST SAY. YOU HAVE A SITUATION HERE WHERE YOU JUST DESCRIBED, JUDGE, ONE SET OF FACTS FROM ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER SET OF FACTS FROM ANOTHER. AND THEN SHE SAYS THE PARTY OCCURRED. HE SAYS I WASN’T AT THAT PARTY. HE SAYS I DON’T KNOW WHEN THE PARTY WAS. HOW CAN HE DENY HE IS AT A PARTY SHE HASN’T IDENTIFIED? FIRST, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING. WHEN SHE SAYS SOMETHING, HE HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT IS. Juan: OKAY. BUT IN THE END, THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN EVEN CONSIDER BRINGING IN THE F.B.I. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS A SIMPLE ONE. EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT LET’S BRING IN THE F.B.I. WHY THE HELL HAVEN’T YOU ASKED THE F.B.I. TO GET INVOLVED? WHY DID DIANNE FEINSTEIN SIT ON THIS FOR SIX WEEKS? WHY DID SHE SIT ON IT FOR 36 YEARS? Juan: IT WAS ANONYMOUS. IT WAS. NO THEY KNEW WHO SHE WEDNESDAY. Juan: WHO SHE WAS. Juan: SHE WAS ANONYMOUS. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ASKED ABOUT. IN THIS CASE, WHEN SOMEONE IS NOMINATED FOR THE SUPREME COURT AND SUDDENLY YOU HAVE ALL THE WORLD’S EYEBALLS FIXED ON THIS GUY. NOW THEY ARE GOING TO FLY SPECK HIM. I DON’T CARE WHO YOU ARE. THAT IS A FACT. SO SUDDENLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM AND HAD QUESTIONS. REMEMBER, IN THE SECOND CASE, THAT WOMAN WASN’T COMING FORWARD. THE WOMAN AT YALE. HOW DID THEY FIND HER? Juan: THE DEMOCRAT HEARD STORIES ABOUT WELL THEN WHERE IS THE COB RATING CORROBORATING WITNESS TO SAY THEY HEARD FROM SOMEONE. I’M WITH YOU, JUDGE. BRING IN THE F.B.I. IN. NO. THE F.B.I. DOESN’T DO THESE CASES. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVEN’T ANSWERED YES. Juan: I’LL TELL YOU WHAT IS INTERESTING GOING ON TODAY THIS IS ALL CONFUSION AND ALL Juan: NO, NO. WHAT IS INTERESTING THAT MARTHA MacCALLUM TONIGHT IS GOING TO HAVE KAVANAUGH AND HIS WIFE ON HER SHOW. TO ME THIS IS LIKE WOW! YOU MEAN A GUY WHO IS UP FOR A SUPREME COURT NOMINATION DECIDES IT’S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A BREAK AND DO TV? Jesse: I THINK HE IS TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF. Greg: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YOU CAN’T SMEAR A GUY FROM TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF. Juan: I’M SAYING BOY, DID YOU SEE THE FOX POLL? THE FOX POLYPED KATES NOW MORE PEOPLE BELIEVE FORD THAN BELIEVE KAVANAUGH. Greg: WHAT A SURPRISE AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO HIM. IF ALLEGATIONS ARE ENOUGH WITHOUT WITNESS OR WITHOUT EVIDENCE, YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT YOUR HUSBANDS, YOUR BROTHERS, YOUR SONS AND YOUR FATHERS. AND YOURSELF. Greg: THERE NEEDS TO BE A NEW WOMAN MOVEMENT CALLED MOMMA BEAR BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING FOR YOUR SONS. CAN YOU BE PART OF IT IF YOU ARE NOT A MOM? DON’T EXCLUDE ME, GREG. Greg: WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS BECAUSE YOU CAN’T NOMINATE MEN ANYMORE? YOU KNOW WHO IS THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE? JUDGE PIRRO. NOT A CHANCE! LET ME TELL YOU, ALL I’D LIKE TO DO IS QUESTION THE TWO OF THEM. THAT IS ALL I WANT TO DO. Jesse: MORE PROOF THAT THE FACTS ON KAVANAUGH DON’T MATTER TO DEMOCRATS. THE LATEST LEFT WING SMEAR AHEAD.
