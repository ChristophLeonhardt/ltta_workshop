windows 8 has a radically new interface that's made to work on touchscreen devices like tablets so since everything's been changed around since the last version of Windows 7 we're gonna show you how to multitask and switch between apps you already have open the first thing to do is swipe over from the left side of your screen to get the menu of apps that are already running so you see this list view of thumbnails of apps that you already have running and you just tap one to open it you can also quickly cycle through open apps by swiping over from the left side of the screen very quickly you can also run two apps at the same time in a split-screen mode by swiping over slightly and letting the apps snap into place you can also adjust the size of which app takes up most of the screen and which app just takes up a column on the side
