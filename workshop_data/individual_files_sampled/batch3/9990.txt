Reporter: A WEEK AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOCKED NORTH KOREA AND CENTEDING A LETTER TO KIM JONG-UN CANCELLING THE SUMMIT. IT WAS A HIGH WIRE DIPLOMATIC MOVE AND THE ONE THAT THE PRESIDENT INSISTS PAID OFF. IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A TOUGH STATEMENT. I THINK WE ARE OVER THAT. Reporter: THIS WAS A LETTER HAND DELIVERED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND AT FIRST THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO INDICATE IT READ IT. IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE AND GIVE IT TO YOU. AND MAYBE FAIRLY SOON. Reporter: AND LATER SAID HE HADN'T. I PURPOSELY DIDN'T OPEN THE LETTER. I HAVEN'T OPENED IT IN FRONT OF THE DIRECTOR. I SAID WOULD YOU WANT ME TO OPEN IT? HE SAID I COULD READ IT LATER. THE WHITE HOUSE SAID KIM WOULD ARRIVE AND DELIVER THE LETTER AND LEFT. BUT THE MEETING WENT A FULL HOUR AND 15 MINUTES THE PRESIDENT AND VICE CHAIRMAN ENJOYING A COURTEOUS RELATIONSHIP. THE PRESIDENT LOWERED THE EXPECTATION WITH KIM JONG-UN SAYING IT WOULD BE THE START OF A LONG NEGOTIATION. WE'LL BE IN SINGAPORE IN JUNE 12TH. AND I NEVER SAID IT HAPPENS IN ONE MEETING AND TALKING ABOUT YEARS OF HIS TOLITY AND PROBLEM AND HATRED BETWEEN SO MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS. Reporter: THE PRESIDENT SAID MAYBE THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH KOREA COULD SIGN AN AGREEMENT AND FINALLY END THE WAR. WE TALKED ABOUT I UNDERSTANDING THE WAR AND IT IS GOT TO BE THE LONGEST WAR. ALMOST 70 YEARS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD COME OUT OF THE MEETING. Reporter: ONE POSSIBLE I CUP, THE MEETING BETWEEN RUSSIAN FOREIGN SECRETARY AND KIM JONG-UN. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S INITIAL REACTION. I DIDN'T LIKE THE RUSSIAN MEETING YESTERDAY. I SAID WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THAT BUT IT COULD BE A POSITIVE MEETING. IF IT IS POSITIVE, I LOVE IT. IF IT IS A NEGATIVE MEETING, I AM NOT HAPPY. AND HE HAD A NEW PACKAGE OF SANCTIONS TO GO AGAINST NORTH KOREA IN CASE THE SUMMIT FELL
