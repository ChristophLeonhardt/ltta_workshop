WHILE THE LEADERSHIP OF NORTH
AND SOUTH KOREA ARE POTENTIALLY
MOVING TOWARDS PEACE, OR AT
LEAST GETTING A LITTLE CLOSER,
THE FAMILY OF OTTO WARMBIER IS
ALSO MOVING CLOSER TO SOMETHING
CAN THAT'S THEIR LAWSUIT AGAINST
NORTH KOREA --
IF YOU DON'T RECALL THIS
STORY --
I WOULD DESCRIBE THAT AS TOO
MUCH.
THAT SEEMS A LITTLE OUT OF
CONTROL.
AND IT WENT IN AN EVEN
DARKER DIRECTION --
HE WAS EFFECTIVELY ON THE
BRINK OF DEATH WHEN THEY
FINALLY RETURNED HIM, AND HE
DIED SHORTLY THEREAFTER,
NOW THEY ARE SUING.
IT WAS HORRIFIC.
BLIND, DEAF,
I THINK I SAW SOMETHING THAT HIS
PARENTS WERE SEEING HIS TEETH
LOOK LIKE THEY HAD BEEN PULLED
OUT AND REARRANGED.
CLEARLY TORTURED.
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHO SPENT
SOME TIME IN NORTH KOREA AS
CAPTIVES, AND IT'S NOT PRETTY.
WE KNOW THIS GOING INTO IT,
WHICH IS WHAT IS SO UPSETTING.
BUT I WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS
STORY WHEN IT ALL STARTED
HAPPENING, SO I STARTED DOING
RESEARCH INTO THE TOUR GROUP HE
WENT WITH, AND JUST WHY ANYONE
WOULD, AND ALL OF THE DRINKING
INVOLVED, AND THIS AND THAT,
NONE OF IT MAKES IT OKAY, IT'S
JUST IT WASN'T SURPRISING
UNFORTUNATELY THAT THIS IS
HOW IT ENDED.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THOSE
THINGS ARE GOING ON, AT LEAST AT
THIS POINT, MAYBE WE ARE MOVING
TOWARD A PLACE WHERE WE CAN
DO THAT SORT OF THING.
I KNOW A GUY WHO IS A
PHOTOGRAPHER WHO HAS BEEN IN A
GROUP WHERE THEY ARE LIKE, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO GO PHOTOGRAPH NORTH
KOREA?
AND FREQUENTLY WHEN THEY
RECOUNT THEIR STORIES THEY ARE
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO TOE THE LINE
BETWEEN REPORTING ACCURATELY ON
WHAT HAPPENED, BUT ALSO TRYING
TO GET INVITED BACK AGAIN.
SO
THAT'S THE DIFFICULT LINE TO
WALK.
THERE'S A GREAT BOOK, I
WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS, IT'S
CALLED THE ORPHANMASTER'S SON,
IT'S WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO WENT
ON ONE OF THOSE DELEGATIONS, AND
ITS FICTION LIES IS IT IN LINE
WITH HOW WEIRD AND FICTITIOUS
THE EXPERIENCE IN NORTH KOREA
ACTUALLY FEELS, IT CRAFTS A
COMPELLING NARRATIVE TO
COMMUNICATE IF NOT THE EXACT
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THERE,
BUT THE TRUTHS, AND THEY DRAW ON
REAL THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED
IN NORTH KOREA.
LIKE KIM JONG-IL
SAYING I LIKE THAT JAPANESE
OPERA STAR, KIDNAP HER AND BRING
HER BACK.
AND THAT HAPPENS,
THERE ARE KIDNAPPINGS ALL THE
TIME.
PEOPLE SNEAKING INTO SOUTH
KOREA, KIDNAPPINGS, SMUGGLING
THINGS BACK, A LOT OF THE
ECONOMY IS BASED ON COUNTERFEIT
AND GRAFT, IT'S WEIRD.
I HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK NOW.
IT'S AMAZING.
BUT THIS STORY
IS ONE OF, WHAT ARE WE SAYING TO
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH
IT, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS
WITH ME THIS MORNING, WHAT
MESSAGE DOES IT SEND THAT WE ARE
ESSENTIALLY LOOKING FOR PEACE,
WHAT DO WE SAY TO THESE PEOPLE
WHO ARE AMERICANS WHO HAVE GONE
THROUGH THESE TERRIBLE
EXPERIENCES, AND TO PEOPLE WHO
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE WORST
DURING THIS?
WHAT ABOUT THE THREE WHO ARE
STILL THERE?
ARE WE APPEASING THEM?
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?
AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOTED YOU
DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR
FRIENDS, YOU ONLY MAKE PEACE
WITH YOUR ENEMIES, THAT THE ONLY
PERSON YOU CAN, AND IN EVERY
CONFLICT THERE WILL BE TERRIBLE
STUFF.
AND IN SOME CASES, THEY
HAVE SET UP TRUTH AND
RECONCILIATION COMMITTEES AND
THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT GONE
FORWARD ON PROSECUTING CLEAR WAR
CRIMES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT.
IT COULD BE THAT THAT IS
NECESSARY TO GET NORTH KOREA TO
JOIN THE REST OF US RIGHT NOW,
BUT I WILL SAY THIS: I WANT
PEACE THERE, BUT PEACE IS NOT
THE ABSENCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
PEACE ISN'T EVEN THE ABSENCE OF
ARTILLERY AIMED AT SEOUL.
PEACE
IS THE PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA NOT
BEING BRUTALIZED AND ENSLAVED
AND TORTURED AND MURDERED.
AND I
DON'T KNOW IF THAT CAN HAPPEN
NOW OR IF IT HAS TO HAPPEN OVER
THE COURSE OF DECADES, BUT I
KNOW THAT IF WHAT COMES OUT OF
THIS IS THEY ACTUALLY DO
DENUCLEARIZE AND PULL SOME OF
THEIR FORCES AWAY FROM THE
BORDER THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT
IF THAT ALLOWS KIM JONG-UN AND
HIS SONS OR WHATEVER TO RULE FOR
ANOTHER 100 YEARS AND THE PEOPLE
OF NORTH KOREA ARE IN THE SAME
STATE AS THEY ARE NOW, HOW IS
THAT PEACE IN ANY MEETING OF THE
WORD?
THAT IS WHAT IS ANGERING
PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE HIM SMILING
AND BEING CHEERED ON, THEY ARE
HOLDING HANDS AND CROSSING THE
BORDER, AND HIS SISTER IS BEING
CELEBRATED AT THE OLYMPICS, AND
SHE IS OUR NEW SHADE QUEEN,
THAT IS WHAT IS FORGOTTEN I
THINK IN THIS CONVERSATION.
IT'S THOSE WEIRD MOMENTS LIKE
AT THE OLYMPICS WHEN THEY
REALIZED IN THE NORTH KOREAN
CHEERING DELEGATION THAT THE
CAMERA WAS ON THEM, THEY WENT
FROM LIKE THIS TO DOING THEIR
CHOREOGRAPHED --
THAT'S PROBABLY ALL
CHEERLEADERS THOUGH.
BUT LOOK,
I'M TRYING TO BE REALISTIC,
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T JUST SKETCH
OUT YOUR FANTASY FOR WHAT IS
WANT TO HAPPEN AND EXPECT TO
HAPPEN, HE'S NOT GO TO STEP
DOWN, HE'S NOT GOING TO DIE
TOMORROW, AND I DO THINK HE
DESPERATELY WANTS TO BE A WAR
LEADER THAT GETS TO -- HE IS
BASICALLY TRUMP, HE WANTS TO GO
TO PARTIES AND HAVE PEOPLE TALK
NICE ABOUT HIM.
OBVIOUSLY THERE
WILL HAVE TO BE ACCESS TO NORTH
KOREA IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE
ANYTHING THEY SAY ABOUT
DENUCLEARIZATION, NOW THEY
WOULD NEVER ALLOW THAT SO
THAT WOULD BE A BIG STEP.
BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
THESE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
AREN'T HAPPENING ANYMORE.
HE MIGHT WELL HAVE TO BE THE
LEADER BUT HE CAN'T RULE IN
THE WAY HE HAS.
BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT HAS
TO BE A PRIORITY, AND IT'S
BEING LEFT OUT IT SEEMS SO FAR.
WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY
STAGES.
THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE
OPTICS THAT COME OUT OF PEACE,
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF STRATEGIC
THINGS THAT THESE MAJOR PLAYERS
DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP.
CHINA
WANTS A GEOGRAPHICAL BUFFER
BETWEEN THEM AND THE AMERICAN
BASIS IN SOUTH KOREA, CHINA
WANTS US TO GET RID OF OUR, WHAT
DO WE HAVE, THREE MILITARY BASES
AT LEAST IN SOUTH KOREA?
WHICH
GIVES US A STRATEGIC FOOTHOLD IN
THE EAST CHINA SEA.
OF COURSE
CHINA ONCE US OUT, OF COURSE WE
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
WE WILL SEE
HOW THESE NEGOTIATIONS GO, BUT
IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT'S PRETTY
EASY TO DECLARE A SYMBOLIC
VICTORY, GRANTED NO ONE HAS DONE
IT BEFORE BY GOING AND PLANTING
TREES, WE ARE STILL, AS YOU SAY,
VERY FAR AWAY FROM SEEING PEACE
HERE.
FROM WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS.
I THINK THE MOST PRACTICAL
SHORT RANGE GOAL IS FOR CHINA TO
SAY, OKAY, HERE IS WHAT YOU DO.
YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF SEMBLANCE
OF CAPITALISM, BUT STILL HERE IS
HOW TO MAINTAIN DICTATORIAL
CONTROL OVER YOUR PEOPLE BY
DOING WHAT WE DO IN CHINA BUT
STILL BEING ABLE TO BE REPUTABLE
THE WORLD OVER.
LIKE, THAT'S IT,
AND WE WILL GET CHINA HEAVY,
CHINA HAS BECOME CHINA LITE, WE
WILL GET CHINA HEAVY, THAT'S THE
PRACTICAL NEXT STEP AND THAT'S
ALL WE CAN LEAVE HOPE FOR AND WE
WILL SEE HOW IT GOES.
IT'S
POSSIBLE TRUMP WILL GO BACK TO
THE OTHER HAYLEY MILLS IN THIS
PARENT TRAP AND JUST BE LIKE,
YOU KNOW, HE'S A ROCKET MAN.
