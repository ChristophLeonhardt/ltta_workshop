Ivanka Trump met with former Vice

President Al Gore yesterday to discuss

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,560
climate pilot policy in the new

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,259

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,240
the little village of what a Saperstein

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,520
Ivanka got her first glimpse of the

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,740
Gothic castle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that house dr. von</font>

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,230
knudniks home for the terminally insane

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,650
the institution stood on a hilltop

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,090
silhouette it against a darkening sky

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,849
lit by occasional flashes of lightning

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">that revealed its crumbling battlements</font>

13

and forbidding facade it's barred<font color="#E5E5E5"> window</font>

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,989
seemed to stare out at her<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ivanka</font>

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,360
thought like the eyes of a man<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has</font>

cobbled<font color="#CCCCCC"> street strangely empty now and</font>

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,239
then she thought she spied a villager

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,649
peeking out at her from behind the

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,420
curtains of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cottage but whenever she</font>

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,660
turned to look there was no one there

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,430
finally spying a peasant pulling the

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,829
cart she approached him excuse me she

25
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,440
said where<font color="#E5E5E5"> is everyone and why are you a</font>

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,570
peasant pulling a cart when it's 2016

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peasants stared at her with eyes</font>

full of fear<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people of what a</font>

away not knowing what<font color="#CCCCCC"> else to do the</font>

40
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,189
shapely blonde began walking into the

41
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,680
rapidly darkening woods ignoring the

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,229
wild howling of mad dogs and

43
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,509
environmentalists that began with the

51
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,940
padded cell after another until she

52
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,369
spied a lighted door<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of a</font>

53

vaulted hallway there in a room ablaze

extraordinarily cool the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy who</font>

119
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,240
invented this these devices his guy

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,409
named<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked had a long</font>

conversation with him on the phone he

122
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,310
started out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defense industry his</font>

123
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,360
job was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fired a guided missile at</font>

this is what Mike<font color="#CCCCCC"> thud did if you fire a</font>

126

guided missile at a jet he invented<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

127
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:24,549
box that made the missile miss<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font>

128
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:26,699
is what this guy did he's a steely-eyed

129
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">rocket man all right and he suddenly</font>

130
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,599
occurred to him if I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a rocket a</font>

131
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,319
missile miss a fighter jet I can be

132
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,739
fuddle a troopers radar and so he has

133
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,509
invented this thing that does not use it

134
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:42,429
doesn't use broadcast technology so it's

135
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,799
not governor bull by the FCC these are

136
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,329
the only detectors in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world that</font>

137
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,119
include radar and laser scrambling

technology in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to radar radar</font>

139
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,319
and laser detection so you know where

the cop is you know he's there he can't

141
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,769
read your speed because of this fast

142
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,349
enough before you can slow down you can

143

slow down before<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can read your speed</font>

144
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,989
because you are scrambling his

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,830
crazy just sell how insane Al Gore stuff

312
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,870

314
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,830
planet has gotten a little bit a little

315
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,050
bit warmer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I keep saying you know</font>

316
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,090
a lot of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lakes used to be glaciers</font>

317
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,330
where was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Al then what we've found it</font>

318
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,340
the planet were on a rock<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's spiraling</font>

319
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,950
into the Sun it gets warm it gets cold

320
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the changes over time measurements that</font>

321
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,300
take in a hundred years don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a</font>

322
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,540
thing computer programs that attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

323
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,850
predict the climate which has too many

324
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,710
variables to be predictable even to

325
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,450
computers even two brilliant computers

326
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,310
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't been right once they</font>

327
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,140
haven't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know first first show me a</font>

328
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,840
climate prediction that works over 10

329
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,350
years 20 years and then I'll dismantle

330
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,200
the government and second of all even if

331
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,810
even if the climate<font color="#E5E5E5"> is changing there's</font>

332
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,120
nothing we can do about it the earth

333
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,940
could care less whether we drive a car

334
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,500
whether we don't you know I mean

335
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously we all want we all want</font>

336
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,160
conservation we all want clean air we

337
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">all want clean water but this guy is out</font>

338
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,140
of his mind and ivanka needs to go home

339
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,980
I mean with her it is lovely lovely

340
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,510

send out Mike Pence because everybody

342
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,110
everybody on the right just reacted to

343
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,420
this like Al Gore you gotta be kidding

344
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,450
me and Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> has said that he thinks</font>

345
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">climate change is a big hoax and all</font>

346
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,930
this so they send out Mike Pence Mike

348
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,950

today and what what you're seeing is in

356
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,510
the president elects efforts is a

357
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,920
recognition that he wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

358

363
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,120
ground particularly in the area of

364
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,180
conservation was reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> some came up i</font>

379
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,310
good thing but I it was the look on Al

380
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,290
Gore's face that got me because when he

381
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,370
came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of there and he made that</font>

382
