. WELCOME BACK TO THE NEXT REVOLUTION. MY NEXT GUEST IS AN INCREDIBLE CHARACTER AGAINST OTHER THINGS HE FOUNDED AND EXPOSED THE CORRUPTION INSIDE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. HIS LATEST BOOK MAPS OUT HOW THIS COUNTRY GOT TO WHERE IT IS AND HOW WE CAN FIX IT. IT'S CALLED TAIL SPIN. BY THE WAY, BIG NEWS, IT HIT THE BEST SELLER LIST TODAY, WE'RE TOLD. WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT THE AUTHOR IS HERE. IT'S FANTASTIC TO SEE YOU. CONGRATULATIONS. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. STEVE: I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS BOOK MYSELF. I'M NOT JUST SAYING IT. YOU PUT IT ON THE LIST. STEVE: EXACTLY. IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD. AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY ANY OF YOUR COMMENTS. WE'LL DIVE IN. THE ARGUMENT IS BEGINNING IN THE LATE 1960s, EARLY 1970s, ALL THESE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING IN AMERICA GRADUALLY STARTED TO TURN AGAINST US. STEVE: UH-HUH. TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE, AMERITORACY, OBVIOUSLY A GREAT DEAL. GOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO YALE BECAUSE OF THAT. THROUGH A SERIES OF TWISTS AND TURNS, THE MERITOCRACY ENDED UP ARMING ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE EARLIER SEGMENT WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE SMARTER AND TOUGHER AND, FRANKLY, MORE INCLINED TO ACHIEVE WHATEVER THEY COULD ON THEIR OWN AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE COMMON GOOD. STEVE: SO YOU RUN THINGS LIKE THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, FOR EXAMPLE. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. WE ALL LOVE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. BUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT HAS BEEN USED IN ESSENCE TO MONETIZE THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY. STEVE: EXPLAIN THAT. IN A SERIES OF COURT DECISIONS AND I THINK ACTUALLY RIGHTLY THE KEY THING ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS THE BENEFIT TO THOSE WHO LISTEN TO SPEECH. NOT NECESSARILY THE SPEAKER. STEVE: UH-HUH. SO IF THE BENEFIT IS TO THOSE WHO LISTEN, THEN WHY WOULD YOU DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE SPEAKING AND SAY, WELL, A PERSON CAN SPEAK BUT A CORPORATION CAN'T. AND THAT'S A TERRIFIC ARGUMENT UNTIL YOU LOOK AT IT AND SAY, WELL, WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT ANY CORPORATION IN AMERICA CAN GIVE AS MUCH MONEY AS IT WANTS TO ANY CANDIDATE THAT IT WANTS. SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. BECAUSE AS MUCH AS MY LIBERAL FRIENDS DON'T LIKE THIS, CITIZENS UNITED IF YOU READ THE CONSTITUTION I THINK WAS ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE THEED ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE THEE ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEEE ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEED ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEED T ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE NEED TO FIX IT. STEVE: THE WAY THAT FINANCIAL ENGINEERING TOOK OVER THE ECONOMY AND PUSHED OUT MANUFACTURING, JUST EXPLAIN HOW YOUR ARGUMENT CREATE A KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY WHICH IS WHAT AMERITOCRACY DOES. THAT'S LEGAL KNOWLEDGE OR BANKING KNOWLEDGE OR THE FINANCIAL ENGINEERING THAT BASICALLY TURNS THE COUNTRY INTO AN ECONOMY WHEREAS AN ECONOMY WHEREA AN ECONOMY WHERE AN ECONOMY WHERE AS AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSE AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSETS AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSETS A AN ECONOMY WHERE ASSETS ARE TRADED. THEY'RE TURNED INTO MORTGAGES BACK TO SECURITIES. THERE IS OFTEN STOCK BUYBACKS. ALL THIS STUFF THAT MAKES THE BANKERS AND LAWYERS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT DOESN'T CREATE A SINGLE JOB. IN FACT, IT KILLS JOBS. STEVE: THIS IS INTERESTING. ALL OF THESE THREADS COME TOGETHER, I THINK. AND YOU'RE SAYING 50 YEARS TO THE MOMENT WHERE YOU FIND PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND THEY ELECT DONALD TRUMP. Lisa: YES. SO HOW MUCH BASED OFF OF YOUR BOOK, HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS, AS STEVE JUST LAID OUT, HOW MUCH DOES THAT LEAD TO WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE IN A POLITICAL SOCIETY. THAT, IN FACT, IS THE WAY THE BOOK ENDS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T IN THE MIDDLE. PEOPLE WHO AREN'T IN THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY WHO FEEL SO SHUT OUT AND SO FRUSTRATED THAT THEY TURN TO A GUY WHO PROMISES I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT. NOW, Lisa: WHICH HE HAS. WELL, HE HAS. BUT HE'S ALSO DONE A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE HURT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET RID OF THE PAY DAY LENDING NEGOTIATION SO THE PAY DAY LENDERS CAN GO BACK AND CHARGE THESE WORKERS WHO ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE JOBS 100% INTEREST, THAT'S NOT A GREAT THING. Lisa: YOU TALK ABOUT TOO OBVIOUSLY THE THINGS THAT YOU FOCUS IN THESE INSTITUTION THAT'S ARE NOW CORRUPT AND HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SOCIETY. WHAT OTHER STEVE: FINISH YOUR POINT. Lisa: WHAT OTHER INSTITUTIONS DO YOU LABEL AT OR THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT DO YOU DISCUSS IN THE BOOK? WELL, PRETTY MUCH THE LEGAL ECONOMY. AND I ACTUALLY AM AWARE WITH THAT. THE FINANCIAL ECONOMY. JUST THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY. STEVE: I WAS INTERESTED. IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING. SORRY TO INTERRUPT. THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING POINT THE WAY DUE PROCESS AND LEGAL PROCESS HAS ACTUALLY HAD SUCH A NEGATIVE IMPACT. AND THE LAWYERS ARE SORT OF HAVE SORT OF GOTTEN TO EVERYTHING. THE LAWYERS IN WASHINGTON BETWEEN 1973 AND 1983 TRIPLED. AND WHAT WERE THEY DOING? THEY WERE LOBBYING. AND THEY WERE LOBBYING IN CONGRESS AND LOBBYING THE REGULATORY AGENCIES. THE FIRST REGULATORY AGENCY IN 1974 WAS TEN PAGES LONG AND TOOK LESS THAN A YEAR TO WRITE, WHICH I THINK IS STILL TOO LONG. THE LAST ONE WRITTEN IN 2017 WAS 604 PAGES LONG AND TOOK 19 YEARS TO WRITE. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS GOING ON IN THOSE 19 YEARS? THE LOBBYISTS WERE FIGHTING OVER AND ONCE THEY PRODUCE THE 604 PAGE REGULATION, THEN THEY CAN FIGHT OVER ALL OF THE PARAGRAPHS ON ALL 604 OF THOSE PAGES WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO ENFORCE THE REGULATION. THAT IS THE ECONOMY WE CREATED. STEVE: AND THE OTHER POINT YOU MAKE IS THAT THIS EMPOWERS THE BIG CORPORATION, THE BIG BUSINESS. THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD THE LAWYERS AND EVERYTHING. AND, AGAIN, THAT'S PART OF THIS POPULIST MOVEMENT WHICH IS PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THOSE THE BIG CENTRALIZED ORGANIZATIONS HAVING ALL OF THE POWER. Lisa: THAT WAS SORT OF THE MESSAGE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP RAN WITH DURING THE ELECTION, RIGHT. IT WAS STANDING UP FOR THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN. MANY PEOPLE THAT FELT LIKE POLITICIANS DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH TO COME AND EVEN SPEAK WITH THEM. LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON. SHE DIDN'T EVEN STEP FOOT IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. RIGHT. SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE WHO FELT LIKE THEIR VOICES WERE FORGOTTEN, OBVIOUSLY IT WAS. BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON WHO MANY DEEM WAS AN ELITE WAS AN ELIIS WAS AN ELIIST WAS AN ELIIST WH WAS AN ELIIST WHO WAS AN ELIIST WHO DI WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T E WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T EVE WAS AN ELIIST WHO DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO STEP FOOT AND TALK TO THE GENERAL ELECTION.
