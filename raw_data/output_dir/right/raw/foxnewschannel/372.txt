THOROUGH.

00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:47,952

BEEN ANSWERED.

65
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,045
MANY ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARE

66
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,113
THUMPING THEIR CHEST AND

67
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:15,814
STOMPING THEIR FEET.

68
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,315
WE MUST HAVE AN FBI

00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:17,749
INVESTIGATION.

70
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,650

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:20,885
NOW THEY HAVE IT.

73
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,554

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,029
OATH.

82
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,130
WE HEARD FROM THE PEOPLE WHO

OVER HIS CAREER.

94
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,647
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE SO ANGRY

95
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,416
AND CHASING DOWN SENATORS IN

96
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,417
THE HALLS AND SCREAMING

00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:56,588
THEIR HEADS OFF AS IF THOSE

98
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:57,922
MEN HAVE PERSONALLY AND

99
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:00,024
INDIVIDUALLY WRONGED THEM,

100
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,192
THEY DON'T EVEN STOP AND

101
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:04,863
THINK ABOUT THE 28 YEARS OF

102
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,765
PUBLIC SERVICE OF JUDGE

103
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,399
KAVANAUGH.

104
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,732
FEMALE.

105
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,434
ALL OF THEM ARE STANDING BY

106
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:09,801
THEM.

107
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:11,603
NOT ALL OF THEM VOTED FOR

108
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:12,036
DONALD TRUMP.

109
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:12,804
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED

110
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:13,805
BRETT KAVANAUGH.

111
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:14,672
LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT

112
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:15,707
THOSE WHO ARE ANGRY.

113
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,474
I RESPECT THE FACT THAT I

114
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,176
LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE

115
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:18,643
CAN DISAGREE.

116
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:20,111
THEY ARE NOT DISAGREEING.

117
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,980
THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY.

118
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:24,949
THIS IS ACRIMONY AND ANGER

119
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,117
THAT DIDN'T METASTASIZE

120
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,218
THREE WEEKS AGO.

121
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,319
SOME OF THESE WOMEN HAVE

122
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,155
BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND

123
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:33,825
MARINATING IN IT FOR YEARS.

124
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,927
CHASING DOWN ORRIN HATCH AND

125
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:36,828
CHUCK GRASSLEY DID.

126
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,896
THEY INDIVIDUALLY WRONG

127
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:38,329
THESE WOMEN?

128
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,964
THEY CAN'T BE HELD

129
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:40,799
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER MAN

130
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,736
OR MEN HAVE WRONGED THESE

131
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,838
WOMEN CHASING PEOPLE OUT OF

132
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:47,305
RESTAURANTS.

133
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:48,306
BRIAN: REPUBLICANS ARE NOT

134
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,308
CHASING DOWN DEMOCRATS.

135
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,443
AINSLEY: NO.

136
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,645
BRIAN: THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

137
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:54,679
HAS BEEN REGARDING THE

138
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:54,979
ISSUE.

139
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,680
REAL QUICK.

140
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:56,915
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT

141
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,116
HOW THESE FOUR ARE GOING TO

142
00:03:58,117 --> 00:03:58,416
VOTE.

143
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,284
YOU BROUGHT UP AN

144
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:00,618
INTERESTING POINT IN THE

145
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:01,619
BREAK ABOUT SENATOR JEFF

146
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:01,920
FLAKE.

147
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:03,154
THERE MIGHT BE SOME TYPE OF

148
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:03,555
CONNECTION.

149
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:04,556
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

150
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:05,256
CONSERVATIVE EVEN THOUGH HE

151
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:05,957
HAS BEEN AT ODDS WITH

152
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:06,458
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

153
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,325
THERE MIGHT BE A CONNECTION

154
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:09,060
BETWEEN THE PROSECUTOR,

155
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,128
MITCHELL, WHO ASKED THE

156
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:10,495
QUESTIONS.

157
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,430
AND CAME TO THOSE

158
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:12,897
CONCLUSIONS.

159
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,199
THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF

160
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,033
HOLES IN THE STORY THAT

161
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:16,401
COULDN'T PROSECUTE

162
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:17,135
DR. FORD'S CASE.

163
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:18,203
AND HOW FLAKE GOES.

164
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:19,370
IN WHAT WAY?

165
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,270
>> NO.

166
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:22,674
THE ONLY THING I WAS SAYING

167
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,008
THAT RACHEL MITCHELL THE SEX

168
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:24,809
CRIMES PROSECUTOR THE

169
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,044
REPUBLICANS OF THE JUDICIARY

170
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,479
COMMITTEE ASKED TO STAND IN

171
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,581
FOR THEM AND POSE THE

172
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:30,615
QUESTIONS TO DR. FORD AND

173
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:30,982
SHE DID.

174
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:32,383
AND I THOUGHT SHE DID A

175
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:34,052
GREAT JOB IN SO DOING.

176
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,186
I'M SURE THAT SENATOR FLAKE

177
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:36,688
IS FAMILIAR WITH HER AND HER

178
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:36,988
WORK.

179
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:39,023
BECAUSE IS HE A LONG-TIME

180
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,058
CONGRESSMAN AND SENATOR

181
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:40,692
REPRESENTING THE STATE OF

182
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:41,025
ARIZONA.

183
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:43,394
BUT, THE MOST IMPORTANT

184
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:44,195
THING ABOUT SENATOR FLAKE

185
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,763
AND I RESPECT THAT HE IS

186
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:46,764
GRAPPLING WITH THIS DECISION

187
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:48,366
AND I APPRECIATE THE

188
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:49,634
INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY IN

189
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,503
WHICH HE HAS APPROACHED THIS

190
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:51,836
PROCESS.

191
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:52,971
THE THING ABOUT SENATOR

192
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,272
FLAKE IS, ONE SHORT WEEK

193
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:55,373
AGO, HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE

194
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:56,508
WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR JUDGE

195
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:56,875
KAVANAUGH.

196
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,643
AND HE DID TO GET JUDGE

197
00:04:58,644 --> 00:04:59,811
KAVANAUGH OUT OF COMMITTEE.

198
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:00,712
REMEMBER, THAT VOTE HAPPENED

199
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:01,546
A WEEK AGO.

200
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:02,814
THAT VOTE STANDS.

201
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,983
HE ADVANCED FROM THE SENATE

202
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:05,650
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

203
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,918
INCLUDING WITH AN

204
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,685
AFFIRMATIVE VOTE FROM

205
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,153
SENATOR FLAKE.

206
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,155
WHAT CHANGED IS HE WAS

207
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,156
APPROACHED OR CONFRONTED IN

208
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:14,292
THE HE WILL VARIED BY THESE

209
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,927
WOMEN WHO I SAID GOD BLESS

210
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:17,061
THEM FOR COMING FORWARD BUT

211
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:20,598
ALSO, THEY NEED TO FEEL THAT

212
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,333
ANGER TOWARD THEIR

213
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,167
INDIVIDUAL PERPETRATORS, NOT

214
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,435
TOWARDS SENATORS UNCONNECTED

215
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:25,103
COMPLETELY FROM THE AWFUL

216
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:26,170
THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO

217
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,472
THEM IN THE PAST.

218
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:28,873
BUT SENATOR FLAKE ALREADY

219
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,942
HAS MADE JOYFUL NOISES ABOUT

220
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:31,576
SUPPORTING JUDGE KAVANAUGH

221
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:33,278
TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

222
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:33,578
COURT.

223
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,346
HE ASKED FOR THE

224
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:35,980
SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION

225
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:36,814
BY THE FBI U AND IT WAS

226
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:37,982
SENATOR FLAKE WHO SAID NO

227
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,384
LONGER THAN ONE WEEK.

228
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:41,452
AND ALL OF THAT HAS COME TO

229
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:41,819
PASS.

230
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,154
SO, NOW HE WILL ANNOUNCE HIS

231
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:43,521
DECISION.

232
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:45,123
I THINK THE WILD CARD HERE

233
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:46,291
IS ALSO SENATOR JOE MANCHIN

234
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,025
FROM WEST VIRGINIA.

235
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,459
A STATE WHERE THE VAST

236
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,561
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO

237
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:50,828
VOTED HIM IN TO OFFICE HAVE

238
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:52,797
SAID THEY ALSO WANT JUDGE

239
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:53,464
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED TO THE

240
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:54,165
SUPREME COURT.

241
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,867
DO YOU LISTEN TO THE WILL OF

242
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,135

00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,304
DO YOU LISTEN TO THE LEADERS

244
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,104
OF A DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO

245
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,941

246
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:05,910

00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:08,279
THEY WANTED TESTIMONY AND

THEY GOT IT THEY WANTED

256
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,050
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI

257
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,717
INVESTIGATION THEY GOT IT

258
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:14,385
HAS A SINGLE DEMOCRAT

259
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:15,587
CHANGED HIS OR HER MIND

260
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:16,454
BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT

261
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:18,289
THEY HAVE ASKED FOR AND HAVE

262
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,656

263
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:19,891
AND LET ME TELL YOU ONE MORE

264
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,492
THING, EVERY WAY THAT DONALD

TRUMP, MY BOSS AND OUR

266
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:24,696
PRESIDENT IS DESCRIBED BY

267
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:25,630
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS

268
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:26,631
EXACTLY HOW THE CRAZY LEFT

269
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:32,437
IS ACTING DESCRIBE HIM AS

270
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:33,638
FUMING AND ANGRY AND

271
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,739
ISOLATED AND THROWING

272
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,073
THINGS.

273
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:36,574
HE IS NOT THAT WAY AT ALL.

274
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,443
I'M WITH HIM EVERY DAY.

275
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:39,944
THE WAY THEY BEHAVE WILL NOT

276
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:40,645
ENDING WITH THE CONFIRMATION

277
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:41,446
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

278
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:42,380
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, THEY HAVE

279
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,214
BEEN WATCHING.

280
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:44,582
IT'S WHY THERE IS MORE

281
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,216
ENTHUSIASM NOW ON THE

282
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:45,750
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

283
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,652
THEY ARE SO APPALLED AT THE

284
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:50,054
TREATMENT OF ONE MAN WHO HAS

285
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,022
HAD 28 YEARS IN PUBLIC

286
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:52,690
SERVICE AND AN IMPECCABLE

287
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:53,825
RECORD TO SERVE IN THE

288
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:54,525
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

289
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:55,793
SEARCH AND DESTROY IS

290
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,362
EXACTLY THE WAY NOT ADVICE

291
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:01,866
AND CONSENT.

292
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:03,635
AINSLEY: SO MUCH HYPOCRISY.

293
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:06,437
WOMEN GETTING IN FACES.

294
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:08,239
THEY ARE USING GENDER TO GET

295
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
THEIR POINTS ACROSS.

296
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:10,541
BUT, YET, THEY'RE ARE THE

297
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,809
RUNNING ATTACKING MEN IN THE

298
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,777
ELEVATOR AND YELLING AT

299
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:13,111
THEM.

300
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,512
HOW DARE YOU TALK TO A WOMAN

301
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:15,947
THAT WAY.

302
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:16,414
IT'S DANGEROUS.

303
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:17,915
>> AINSLEY LET'S SAY AS

304
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:18,983
AMERICANS AND MOMS, TERRIFIC

305
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:20,051
THAT LOTS OF WOMEN ARE

306
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:20,952
COMING FORWARD.

307
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:21,486
>> CORRECT.

308
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:23,488
>> THEY WANT TO TELL THEIR

309
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:23,821
STORIES.

310
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:24,989
THEY NEED TO BE HEARD, BUT

311
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,892
WHY JUST IN THE CONTEXT OF

312
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:28,559
THIS SUPREME COURT HEARING

313
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,262
FOR THIS MAN BASED ON 36

314
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:32,664
YEARS OLD ALLEGATIONS THAT

315
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,632
ARE STILL UNCORROBORATED TO

316
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:35,566
THIS MOMENT?

317
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,902
IF YOU WANT -- IF WE WANT TO

318
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:39,070
HELP WOMEN, SEXUAL ASSAULT

319
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,805
VICTIMS, LET'S DO IT.

320
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:41,406
BUT I DIDN'T SEE NANCY

321
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,106
PELOSI DOING MUCH ABOUT IT

322
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:43,808
WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKER.

323
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,711
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HEAR MUCH

324
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,346
ABOUT IT IN THE 2016

325
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,280
ELECTION WITH QUEEN BEE

326
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:49,947
TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP

327
00:07:49,948 --> 00:07:51,182
AND ALL ASSORTED OF NONSENSE

328
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,583
THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE

329
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:52,917
VOTERS.

330
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:54,218
IN FACT, I DON'T HEAR ABOUT

331
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,086
THE HILLARY CLINTON CENTER

332
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:56,320
FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS NOW TWO

333
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:57,088
YEARS LATER.

334
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,856
THE BILL CLINTON SENATOR

335
00:07:58,857 --> 00:07:59,924
CENTER FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS

336
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:02,126
MIGHT BE A MORE INTERESTING

337
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:02,493
ENDEAVOR.

338
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:03,161
HILLARY CLINTON CENTER FOR

339
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:04,095
WOMEN AND GIRLS.

340
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:04,896
WHERE IS THAT?

341
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:06,631
SHE IS STILL TALKING ABOUT

342
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:07,165
THE 2016 ELECTION.

343
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,533
OF THE HYPOCRISY OF EVEN

344
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:10,134
TRYING TO HELP WOMEN WHO

345
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,603
HAVE BEEN HARMED BY THE LEFT

346
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,772
IS SO -- IT'S SO PERVERTED

347
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,541
OF AND SUBVERTED NOW.

348
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,743
I FEEL SORRY FOR THESE WOMEN

349
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,778
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET

350
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:21,379
SATISFACTION REPUBLICAN

351
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,946
