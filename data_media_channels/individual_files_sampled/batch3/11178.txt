alright let's cross live to London and join Peter Tatchell a humans rights activists are joining us here on the program good to see you today Peter so ecuador makes the announcement today or should I say the Ecuadorian leader makes the announcement where he is in London where you are now saying that eventually Julian Assange will have to leave its embassy in London has it had a change of heart what why do you think Ecuador is now changing its position well the simple answer is we don't know but clearly pressure has been brought to bear presumably by the United States possibly some trade or a deal who knows but what we do know for certain is that the first duty of any state is to protect the life and liberty of its citizens during Assange was granted Ecuadorian citizenship he was granted political asylum so for the prospect of the president revoking that with those protections that go with citizenship and Asylum that's a very very big deal a very big step to abrogate the right to protect the necro Dorian citizen and effectively if he is forced out of the London embassy effectively to hand him to a foreign power now when it comes to what will happen if Assange is forced out of the embassy I really think the ball is in the British government's Court it could come to an agreement yes during Assange did skip bail that's true and under the law he has to pay a penalty but the British government could decide that will be a swift and nominal penalty as would often be the case in these instances but a big really important thing is for the British government to give an assurance that he will not be extradited to the United States where we know that a secret grand jury has been convened and where he's likely to face very serious charges which in all probability will end him up in prison perhaps for 30 or 40 years I don't think a whistleblower or well actually joining us now is not actually a whistleblower he's a publisher he published what others whistle blew the whistle on and I don't think someone who is concerned about freedom of information the right of the public to know someone who's published that information in the same way that the New York Times or The Guardian has published information I don't think they should face the risk of 30 or 40 years in jail in the United States now Peter what does it mean what does it mean you know regarding your last comment there what does it mean about the freedom of speech for example what about unveiling and lifting the lid on covert operations around the world what why has why has Assange been vilified so badly by members over well the Western hierarchy in establishment well clearly by publishing leaks provided by a Chelsea Manning and others WikiLeaks Julian Assange being the key person in WikiLeaks WikiLeaks has deeply embarrassed in particular the government of the United States exposing war crimes human rights abuses double standards in terms of diplomacy and private comfort conversations and exchanges between diplomats which stand in complete contrast to what the US was saying publicly so it's all about Julian Assange caused great embarrassment and the u.s. wants revenge not just on him personally but also as a deterrent to others and I think that whistleblowers and publishers who shine a light on government deception and government abuses they are public servants of the highest order they deserve protection not persecution and the tragic fact is that if June Assange and WikiLeaks had not published that information we the public would not have known about those war crimes and crimes against humanity so Peter do you think it's a good service a good thing that Assange has done to enlighten the public to know about them some of these aspects of foreign policy absolutely I mean the United States has found on the principle of government of the people for the people by the people that the people have a right to know that the government is the servant people the cuthbert was not serving the people by keeping these war crimes and deception secret it was speaking in public saying one thing and in private doing something different I think that anybody during Assange or anyone who shines a light on that is doing a great public service they are a hero of freedom of expression and the right to know which is to me a fundamental element of a democratic society if the people do not know what governments and militaries are doing in their name it is not a democracy and thanks to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks we do know quite a lot of what the US government and military wanted to keep hidden they are heroes now a few moments ago Peter you said that Julian Assange has embarrassed the US government I've heard US officials senators and congressmen calling him a traitor accusing him of treason one pundit on Fox News calling for Julian Assange to be shot to be assassinated we've seen the anti Assange movement among the Western governments but also we've seen a huge amount of public support for him from the basic average ordinary person what do you expect in response now to Assange as possible fate are you expecting widespread public protests or other people gonna stay quiet I think it's very hard to say I mean obviously during the Salinger's reputation has been trashed by the United States government and others and a lot of people you know perhaps you did initially support him feel that there may be something in these allegations certainly the allegations of sexual assault in Sweden did severely diminish the level of public support now of course we know those charges were never actually pressed there were no charges ever pressed against us on John sexual assault the investigation has long been dropped so whatever one thinks about that particular allegation and it is purely an allegation I think that should be set aside you know I always said that during Assange should face those allegations should answer them he was always willing to in fact way back from 2011 he offered to make himself available to the Swedish prosecutors they took out five or more years to originally come to London to interview him and as a consequence of those interviews decided not to receiver the case so you know it is a murky case that has been clouded by these allegations and they are purely allegations I stress of sexual assault so in terms of public support I'm hoping that people will see the big picture which is not to diminish the allegations of sexual assault in any way but they will see the big picture there in this particular instance during Assange is facing various serious charges for publishing information that we the public have a right to know about government abuses and military abuses he should be judged on that and on that basis he should be given support even if people have disagreements or reservations about the sexual assault allegations human rights activist Peter Tatchell joining us live here on this breaking news regarding Julian Assange many thanks appreciate that thank you you
