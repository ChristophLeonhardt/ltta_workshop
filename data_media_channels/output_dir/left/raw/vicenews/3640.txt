1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,700
So what is the name of the braids were doing today

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,135
 

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,080
 

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,440
It's Ghanaian ?!

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,460
 

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,100
Do you want me to show you the two

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,840
Sure I'll look at it

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,060
Anita Yeboah came to the united states

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,055
in 1999 . and has been running hair business

10
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,955
In New Jersey , for the past ten years

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,880
It's the main source of income for her and her kids

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,600
What do you think ?

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,640
I would do two

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,555
You think to?

15
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:43,865
Ok , lets look at second opinion

16
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:48,155
To braid hair in New Jersey you need

17
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:49,485
a cosmetology licence

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,400
The cosmetology schools mainly focus on cutting coloring

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
and styling hair with tools and chemicals

20
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:59,355
So , why didn't you choose to go to  cosmelogy shcool

21
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:02,125
If I really wants to do chemicals

22
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:05,705
I have to go to shcool and pay for money because

23
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:08,595
you are dealing with chemicals its not a joke

24
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:11,325
When I'm doing your hair , I'm using just my comb

25
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,315
and my hands . Thats it,  not too much

26
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:16,995
How much would it cost you

27
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,665
to go to cosmetology school ?

28
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:23,135
I've heard about 15 , 18 somebody told me

29
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,965
now its higher , but I don't know how higher it is

30
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:27,680
15 or 18 what ?

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,260
To 20 thousands dollars , just to have the loan to go

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,860
Anita doesn't have a cosmology license

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,460
so according to the state of new jersey

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,400
her practice is illegal

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,215
Are ever afraid that you're gonna

36
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:46,765
get in trouble or gonna get fined by the state

37
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,920
because you don't have a license ?

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,620
 

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Most of the time

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,520
This is what I want to do to support

41
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:56,695
my family so , sometimes

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,720
you have to deal with it

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
perfect!

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,240
feel pretty fabulous !

45
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,580
 

46
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,520
the new jersey cosmetology board is

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,465
in charge of regulating hair-braiders like anita

48
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,815
and its executive director is Jay Malanga

49
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,840
need to be put through, a vigorous testing process

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,820
now it is possible malanga has lots of experience with

51
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,500
black women hair.

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,860
but we can't it for sure because he ,in the cosmetology board, denied repeated

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,040
requests for interviews for any of its 9 current members

54
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,300
but Peter mcgree who served in the board as

55
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,100
recently as 2016 was willing to talk

56
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,360
how long have you been doing it hair?

57
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,880
how long? Have I've been doing hair? oh god...

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,500
client: since I was a little boy!

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
oh right...

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
yeah ahhaha

61
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,160
have you followed at all the debate

62
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:59,255
around wether or not people who braid and don't use chemicals should

63
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,620
have to go to cosmetology school?

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
 

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,340
I am not sure what the question is again...

66
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,520
right now there is a bill being proposed

67
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,500
and a lot of the braiders in new jersey say they are raised learning how to braid

68
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,920
don't need anybody to teach them

69
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,640
and cosmetology school doesn't give them anything, it just costs them a lot of money

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,700
would you, as a member of the board, support them?

71
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,520
I don't know what this person is going to do

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,140
just braid all his life?

73
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,140
yeah, i think so ..

74
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,005
someone should be trained

75
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,240
I don't care wether it is in the barbershop

76
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,365
as an apprentice or  in a beauty shop or

77
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:38,820
certainly should know

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,060
what he is doing

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,260
so they should .. be qualified

80
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,075
and licensed like we are.

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,960
peter and anita shops are different in almost every way

82
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,600
except in the eyes of the cosmetology board

83
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:58,045
and new jersey braiders are tired of being treated like

84
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:00,185
white and black hair is all the same

85
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:04,215
at a local community meeting, braiders

86
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:07,285
to rally behind assembly women

87
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:10,380
for a bill that would separate hair-braiding from cosmetology

88
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,100
so this bill will

89
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,540
allow you not to have to pay

90
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,840
up to 17,000+ dollars to get training that you do not

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,060
that you do not need and that you don't use

92
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,495
what are some of the cultural and historical things

93
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,460
that were behind hair-braiding?

94
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,640
that maybe your typical law-maker doesn't understand?

95
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,120
if you are not of african descent or African American

96
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,095
you really don't

97
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,925
you really don't have a clue as to

98
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:46,235
how your hair was braided

99
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:49,145
when i get my hair braided people say to me

100
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:52,585
wow your hair is beautiful! how does that happen?

101
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,240
your hair grew so long overnight!

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,460
ahahaha exactly! so what we need to do is educate

103
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,860
So why are the laws set up in this way in the first place?

104
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,255
well, this law happened in 1984

105
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:05,685
and now we are in 2018, so

106
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:09,600
it's time for us to actually look at this law and amend it

107
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,920
assembly women Mcknight expects the bill to

108
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:15,365
be heard in new jersey assembly floor

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,920
Let me tell you guys ! We have a gift

110
00:05:19,060 --> 00:00:00,000
a gift that nobody can take from us
