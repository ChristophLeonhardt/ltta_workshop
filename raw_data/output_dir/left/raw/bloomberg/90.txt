1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,460
Each and every person is walking around
with a large community, up to 10 million,

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,550
bacteria both in and on our body.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,099
If you want to think about that in terms of
weight, your brain is probably around 6 pounds,

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,199
and you probably have at least that weight
of bacteria in you and on you.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,860
So it’s a significant amount of what we
walk around with everyday.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,000
This is uBiome in San Francisco, the first
BioTech Company to be started with

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
a crowdfunding campaign.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,040
Their big bet, that people will want to pay
to find out what’s in their microbiomes,

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,240
kind of like people pay for DNA tests.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,680
The microbiome is the community of
microorganisms that live on us and in us.

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,420
They digest our food, they synthesis
vitamins, they drug us with chemicals that

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,340
they make, they prevent us from getting diseases.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,000
So they are as integral to our health
and wellness as our own bodies.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,599
This area of science is still very new,
but uBiome has found enough interest to create

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,780
a line of products.

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,860
One for people who are simply curious who
can take a basic test to find out more about

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,350
how their diet is affecting their gut, that’s
called Explorer.

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,360
And then there is a more intense version that
only a doctor can order for you, called SmartGut.

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,240
You can tell people medical information,
you can involve their doctor, you can turn

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,080
what was interesting information about the
microbiome into sort of hard medical data

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
that you can use to make medical decisions.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,240
The kits range in cost.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,620
From $89 to $399 depending on how many kinds
of tests you want.

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,560
You can also get a subsidized test if your
doctor prescribes it.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,520
The kit comes in the mail.

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,340
You keep it in the bathroom so that when you’re
ready to give a sample it’s right there

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,010
with all the instructions.

28
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,140
You mail it back without ever having to go
to a lab or the doctor.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,780
But, let’s be clear, this is a little more
intense than a DNA test.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,479
The majority of samples that we receive
come from the intestinal or the gut microbiome.

31
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:11,569
And in that case, a patient will take a
sample of a small bit of stool from

32
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,660
their toilet paper.

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,780
So each of our robots is set up to
do one or more specific tasks.

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,950
This one is extracting DNA from our samples.

35
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:30,900
So we have laid out 96 poo samples and we’re
breaking down those samples and extracting

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
the genetic material.

37
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,940
Breaking down the poo.

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,980
Breaking down the poo.

39
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,020
When sequencing is complete, that
sequence can go into a series of computer

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:47,020
programs that process the sample and we can
then give a report back to our customers

41
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,000
that tell them about the bacteria in their sample.

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,120
uBiome has an argument for why this is
an important test and potentially a better

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,469
business than genetic testing.

44
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:03,950
The company says that impowered by the information
you may actually be able to change the makeup

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,280
of your gut by adjusting your diet.

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
It detects specific pathogens.

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,980
It helps people know which commensal bacteria
they have in their gut and whether or not

48
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,519
it makes them more likely to have IBD versus
IBS.

49
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,889
You can actually do something about it.

50
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:19,840
You can actually influence your own health
and improve it and I see us having a really

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,560
big role in that ecosystem.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,680
One of the things that having our
tests allows us to do is so we can partner

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,659
with collaborators around the world to start
to generate a lot more information around

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,170
how to interpret the microbiome.

55
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,180
We have over 150,000 samples in our
data set now and we should have half a million

56
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:43,159
by the end of 2018.

57
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,669
Microbiome research is in its infancy
but the uBiome founders think one day tests

58
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,629
like this will be just as common as blood
tests, or maybe even more.

59
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,190
They think every time you have the flu or
get food poisoning, every time you start a

60
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,519
new diet plan you’ll want one.

61
00:03:57,519 --> 00:00:00,000
If they’re right, we might all have to get
comfortable swabbing our toilet paper.
