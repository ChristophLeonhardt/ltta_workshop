now with that said I wanted to talk about tax policy a little bit further with you Ryan because I really love the video that you did regarding Orrin Hatch and how he's constantly talking about how he grew up poor so he's looking out they grew up in a chicken coop right so okay so he says he grew up in a chicken coop he also says he worked in a chicken coop but then you did through your research and reporting you found that he also worked as a janitor when he was going to college graduate school yeah yeah and he said in a recent hearing he's like look I worked my way through law school I was a janitor and he's getting old he I think he got a little confused he was a janitor mop some floors during his time and undergrad and then he got a scholarship to go to law school in Pittsburgh and the irony of course is that the the House Republican bill and we'll see what comes out of the final Commerce Committee would say that if you got a scholarship in exchange for agreeing to work your way through school we're going to tax that scholarship as if it was cash money that was delivered to you and so a lot of these graduate students out there make let's say a $12,000 stipend for the year plus then they get 30 or 40 thousand of tuition waived now all of a sudden you're paying taxes on sixty two thousand dollars of income and every dollar that you made has would have to go back to taxes and it just goes to this whole thing about I made it so you should be able to accept after after they made it a lot of things change one they lifted in the ladder up to the cost of law school at the time for him was like thirteen hundred dollars which translates to about eleven thousand dollars in today's money but today's money wouldn't buy you a year of his law school his law school University of Pittsburgh Law School I think is now almost $40,000 in tuition yeah so this is something that I talk about so much and I'm sure it probably like annoys the audience a little bit I care about making public education preserving public education and more importantly making higher education attainable for everyone right but tuition has outpaced inflation so dramatically that you know as we've repeated over over again student loan debt has outgrown credit card debt in the United States which is pretty insane and it's not something that people can get rid of in bankruptcy so I hate these disingenuous talking points that you see from Republicans because they pretend as if everything is the same in higher education in regard to the cost and the housing I mean when you put all of that together it's so incredibly expensive to go to college a lot of people are now foregoing a college education and it's now turning into a system where enlightenment and an opportunities and education is being reserved for the wealthy they want to further worsen that problem with this tax bill and I don't think that enough people are talking about it which is why I loved your report so much yeah and they want to tax your student loans too because in order to they could give away 1.5 trillion dollars in free money to the wealthy and to corporations under the budget reconciliation law but 1.5 trillion is not enough for them so they define ways to raise more money so they can give two or three trillion and have it only raise the deficit by 1.5 so one of the things they did is are going after student loan so right now you pay a couple hundred dollars a month towards your student loans or much more for some people the interest that you pay you can write off on your taxes at the end of the year they want to say no you can't you can't write that off anymore so so they they want to cut the they want to get rid of the estate tax on the backs of people paying back their student loans it's like you can't make that stuff up yeah it's it's pretty incredible and I like that you know people reporters like you are drawing attention to it and and doing so in an easily digestible way because tax policy can get super abstract super complicated and people get turned off by the nitty-gritty of policy issues but it's important that people are empowered with this information so they can fight back so you can know that when you see a Republican or anyone anyone in Congress arguing that these are tax cuts for the middle class they are lying to you they want to get rid of deductions for city and state taxes and that of course disproportionately impacts Burrell States and I don't think that that's any type of accident and graduate students tend to vote Democratic two pros will probably also not a coincidence the scale of this stuff is staggering and this is something that Bernie might talk about today he yesterday introduced a bill with Elizabeth Warren and some other senators interestingly others who want to run for president Kamala Harris Gillibrand got behind his bill that would be a hundred and forty seven billion dollar Marshall Plan for Puerto Rico and it's kind of a messaging bill it's like this would be nice if this could happen and this is what progressives should stand for and then and then we're gonna fight it out later but that's peanuts like it so on the one hand that's a pipe dream like the idea that you could get this 147 billion to these people who more than 50% of them don't even have power and they're at risk of a cholera outbreak and we can't even conceive of the idea that that could actually pass and become law meanwhile chip the children's health insurance program is caught up in this debate over how are you gonna pay for it that's a five billion dollar program five billion hundred forty seven billion yet a 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut is gonna go through completely unpaid for and so you might not care about the the the tax cut but it comes at the expense of these other things that are that we're told while we can't do this can't ensure children can't rebuild Puerto Rico we're spending all the money so I have a question for you Ryan because one of the arguments that you hear from Trump's base over and over again is that they were angry at the establishment they were left behind economically and they voted for the anti-establishment candidate because they wanted to shake things up but you know even with all of these proposals even with the unpopular replacement proposals for the Affordable Care Act and you know considering the unpopularity of these tax plans why is it that his base still remains loyal to him doesn't like anyone's lying to them this is the policy you can read it for yourself and they still remain loyal what I mean obviously I'm asking you to speculate but why do you think that is well some of them don't which is an important point let's say he won 49 percent or so of the vote in in November his approval rating is now down to into the 30s so that's a 20% drop like that's us that's one out of five people that were for him then are no longer for him and that is without a single well now there been some hurricanes but other than that there weren't any real crises that hit him that weren't inflicted by himself on himself that that's with the stock market adding trillions and in kind of paper wealth to the country so he's got all these things going well for him and yet his approval rating does keep coming down so you're gonna have some people who just like they wanted him to shake things up they wanted him to kick the establishment in the teeth he's doing that he's tweeting up a storm he's mocking people he's making fun of Matt Lauer on his way out the door like they there they're eating that up and if you believed that the government wasn't really gonna do anything for you anyway cuz it's a corrupt cesspool then the best you could probably get is an entertaining and it's smacking people around and it's like that's insane to me of the whole system but it might be but it's rational in the sense that if you really don't believe that there's any point to any of this then if he's out there trashing Muslims you know making fun of immigrants and like making fun of Nancy and Chuck and the media then you know that's gonna be good enough for some some percentage but it's not enough like look what happened in the Virginia elections that would happen all the special elections they're gonna get shellacked in the in the midterms even though they've gerrymandered the hell out of the map and that portends him getting shellacked again if he if he's if you survive so a lot of people are sticking with him but not as many as he would need that's that's really interesting oh god I could talk about this stuff forever I just wanted to ask you one last question that's somewhat related to tax policy it's it's more economic policy but one of the recent stories that I covered on t Whitey's main show was the fact that nine Democrats in Congress had joined the GOP to essentially further deregulate some of these banks so they could loosen the restrictions on things like subprime mortgages I'm sure you're familiar with that so what is your take on that because I think when it comes to certain economic policies there are certainly Democrats that are willing to sign on and that was a very specific example for me it shows that a lot of gains have been made that so on the banking committee itself you have people like Elizabeth Warren and sherrod Brown and a couple others who usually vote with them but then you'd have some other ones you've got you've got Tim Kaine who signed the bill you're talking about Mark Warner was on the bill that you're talking about I presume that Manchin was I usually don't even check to see if he was on it that that element of the party still exists they are under a lot more pressure than they used to be if that and so people who would get depressed I'd say you haven't been here long enough like ten years ago you would have had almost every Democrat signed on to that bill now you've only had nine and the nine who did took a lot of heat knew and probably knew they were gonna take heat and said well we're gonna do this anyway and so every time they have to think about it that's oh that's a win for the kind of Warren Sanders wing so it just means that you have to apply more and more and more pressure and you know if Democrats do retake the Senate in the house and the White House and in 2020 they'll be in the minority and they'll be a lot there'll be a lot of pressure on them to come along but you're up against a multi trillion dollar industry so it's it's not anything you're gonna beat quickly or easily
