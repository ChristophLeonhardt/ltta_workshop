00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,031
YOUR DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE 

187
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:12,398
OUR LAWS. 

188
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,301
I SEE IT IN YOUR FACES AS I'M 

189
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,803
ADDRESSING YOU TODAY AND I SEE 

190
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:21,741
IT EVERY TIME THAT I'M WITH ICE 

191
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,041
AND BORDER PATROL PERSONNEL. 

192
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,744
THE CHALLENGE IS ONLY STEAL, 

193
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,379
THE RESOLVE IS COURAGEOUS MEN 

194
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,713
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE THE 

195
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,448
CHARACTER TO SERVE AND I WANT 

196
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,384
TO ASSURE YOU THESE CHALLENGES 

197
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,420
AND THE CHALLENGES YOU FACE 

198
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,557
HAVE ONLY STRENGTHENED THE 

199
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,824
RESOLVE OF THIS PRESIDENT AND 

200
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:39,959
THIS ADMINISTRATION TO STAND 

201
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:51,470
WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. 

202
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,439
[APPLAUSE] 

203
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,175
I WANT TO ASSURE YOU AS I 

204
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,043
TRAVEL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT 

205
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,245
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT 

206
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,279
MEN AND WOMEN OF ICE ARE 

207
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,646
AMERICAN HEROS. 

208
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,015
YOU ARE DOING AN IMPORTANT JOB. 

209
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,151
YOU ARE OFTEN DOING A DANGEROUS 

210
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,351
JOB. 

211
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,987
AND YOU ARE DOING IT FOR THEM. 

212
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,721
AND I WANT TO PROMISE YOU THAT 

213
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:11,357
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 

214
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:11,557
WORK. 

215
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:16,028
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS AGENCY 

216
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,965
HAS BOTH THE SUPPORT, THE 

217
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:20,599
RESPECT AND THE RESOURCES THAT 

218
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,101
YOU DESERVE TO DO THE JOB THAT 

219
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,938
YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED TO DO. 

220
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,273
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT YOU 

221
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:32,111
BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW IMPORTANT 

222
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:32,510
YOUR MISSION IS. 

223
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,714
BUT AS WE ALL HAVE SEEN IN THE 

224
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,551
PRESS LATELY, THE HEROS OF ICE 

225
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,852
ARE BEING ATTACKED AND 

226
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,289
DEMONIZED FOR THE WORK THAT YOU 

227
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,024
DO IN AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE IN 

228
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,624
RECENT WEEKS. 

229
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:46,759
ICE HAS BEEN TARGETED WITH 

230
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,994
PROTESTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY 

231
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,963
NOT ONLY ON THE JOB BUT IN 

232
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,331
PUBLIC SQUARE AND SOCIAL MEDIA 

233
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,535
AND FOR MANY OF YOU EVEN AT 

234
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,637
YOUR HOMES. 

235
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:02,241
THE HASHTAG ABOLLISH ICE IS NOW 

236
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,676
TAKING PLACE ON THE INTERNET. 

237
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,911
PROTESTORS CHANT NO BAN, NO 

238
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:09,482
WALL, NO BORDERS AT ALL AT 

239
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,585
PROTESTS AROUND THE COUNTRY. 

240
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,919
ICE OFFICERS AND LEADERSHIP 

241
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,354
HAVE HAD THEIR PERSONAL 

242
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,690
INFORMATION EXPOSED ON SOCIAL 

243
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,327
MEDIA AND THREATS TO THEIR 

244
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,630
FAMILIES HAVE FOLLOWED THIS. 

245
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,465
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS 

246
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,268
POINT, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE 

247
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:34,339
EVERY RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN 

248
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,441
PEACEFUL PROTESTS BUT THESE 

249
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,043
THREATS AGAINST ICE OFFICERS 

250
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:42,114
AND THEIR FAMILIES MUST STOP 

251
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:48,153
AND THEY MUST STOP NOW. 

252
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:55,928
[APPLAUSE] 

253
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,498
THE SAD FACT IS THOUGH IT ISN'T 

254
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,300
JUST THE EXPRESSION OF THE 

255
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,669
RADICAL LEFT WHO HAVE BEEN 

256
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,202
SPEAKING OUT AGAINST ICE 

257
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:04,436
LATELY. 

258
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,005
THE OPPOSITION OF ICE HAS MOVED 

259
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,741
TO THE CENTER OF THE DEMOCRATIC 

260
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,074
PARTY ITSELF. 

261
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:11,510
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE 

262
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,345
DEMOCRATS COULDN'T MOVE FARTHER 

263
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:18,084
TO THE LEFT, LEADING MEMBERS OF 

264
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,351
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY INCLUDING 

265
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:19,951
CANDIDATES FOR HIGHER OFFICE 

266
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:23,089
ARE ACTUALLY OPENLY ADVOCATING 

267
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:23,589
THE ABOLITION OF ICE. 

268
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,191
AN AGENCY THAT PROTECTS THE 

269
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,160
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR 

270
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,668
COMMUNITIES EVERY SINGLE DAY. 

271
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,201
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, 

272
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,636
SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLEBRAND AND 

273
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:44,110
THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, 

274
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,343
BILL DE BLASIO HAVE CALLED FOR 

275
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:45,945
ICE'S ABOLITION. 

276
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:49,448
A LEADING CANDIDATE FOR 

277
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,182
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK ACTUALLY 

278
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:54,653
EVEN APPAULINGLY CALLED THIS 

279
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:55,820
AGENCY A TERRORIST 

280
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,154
ORGANIZATION. 

281
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:59,391
LET ME BE CLEAR ON THIS POINT, 

282
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:05,531
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A 

283
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:11,370
RIGHT TO THEIR OPINIONS. 

284
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,938
BUT THESE SUREYOUS ATTACKS ON 

285
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:20,146
ICE BY OUR POLITICAL LEADERS 

286
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:20,780
MUST STOP. 

287
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,080
[APPLAUSE] 

288
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,447
THE TYPE OF LANGUAGE THAT'S 

289
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:23,482
BEING USED TO DESCRIBE THE MEN 

290
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,285
AND WOMEN OF THIS AGENCY AND 

291
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,621
THE WORK THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY 

292
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,257
IS UNACCEPTABLE BUT YOU KNOW 

293
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:35,360
IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING IT. 

294
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,932
DESPITE THESE CALLS FROM TOP 

295
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,268
DEMOCRATS EVEN TODAY THE 

296
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:42,868
LIBERAL EDITORIAL PAGE OF THE 

297
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,438
WASHINGTON POST HAD A LEAD 

298
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:48,874
EDITORIAL ENTITLED ICE IS THE 

299
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,045
WRONG TARGET FOR OUTRAGE. 

300
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,247
IN THEIR EDITORIAL AND I QUOTE 

301
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,449
THE WASHINGTON POST 

302
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,049
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE 20,000 

303
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,220
EMPLOYEES OF ICE MANAGED MORE 

304
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,322
THAN DEPORTATIONS THEY WROTE. 

305
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,824
IT'S INVESTIGATED DIVISION 

306
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:09,895
HANDLED CYBER CRIME, HUMAN 

307
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,432
TRAFFICKING, NARCOTICS, COUNTER 

308
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,032
PROLIFERATION, OTHER MILITARY 

309
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:14,800
WEARS, CHILD EXPLOITATION. 

310
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,169
THEY WENT ON TO SAY AND I QUOTE 

311
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,972
IN THE WASHINGTON POST THOSE 

312
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,708
ARE ALL VITAL AND LEGITIMATE 

313
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,879
FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AS IS 

314
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,646
DEPORTATION. 

315
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,982
THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE 

316
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:36,222
ABOLLISHED NOR SHOULD THEY BE. 

317
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:42,127
[APPLAUSE]

318
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:42,795
>> YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS THE 

319
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:48,033
CALLS TO ABOLISH ICE ARE NOT 

320
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,502
JUST OUTRAGEOUS, THEY ARE 

321
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:50,869
IRRESPONSIBLE. 

322
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,139
ABOLISHING ICE WOULD MEAN MORE 

323
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:53,706
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, PEOPLE 

324
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,309
BEING ABLE TO COME INTO OUR 

325
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:57,576
COUNTRY. 

326
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,778
LAST YEAR ICE ACTUALLY REMOVED 

327
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,481
226,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM 

328
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,482
OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR 

329
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:03,883
COUNTRY. 

330
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,118
ABOLISHING ICE WOULD MEAN MORE 

331
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,485
VIOLENT CRIME. 

332
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,321
LAST YEAR ICE ARRESTED MORE 

333
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,023
THAN 127,000 IMMIGRANTS WITH 

334
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,293
CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OR FACING 

335
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,928
CHARGES FOR BREAKING OUR 

336
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,365
NATION'S LAWS INCLUDING 

337
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,332
CRIMINALS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

338
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,967
50,000 ASSAULT OFFENSES, 

339
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,069
11,000, 2,000 KIDNAPPING 

340
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,205
OFFENSES AND 1800 HOMICIDE 

341
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:26,472
OFFENSES. 

342
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,109
ABOLISHING ICE WOULD MEAN MORE 

343
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,878
VICIOUS GANGS LIKE MS13. 

344
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:38,183
NOW I'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH 

345
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:41,853
YOU THE EXTRAORDINARY PROCESS 

346
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,289
WE MADE REMOVING MS13 GANG 

347
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:47,392
MEMBERS FROM OUR STREETS. 

348
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,595
THE TRUTH IS THE ARRESTS 

349
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,596
REPRESENTED 83% INCREASE IN THE 

350
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,330
LAST FULL YEAR. 

351
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,531
THAT'S REAL PROGRESS THAT'S 

352
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,399
MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THE 

353
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,537
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR 

354
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,137
FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. 

355
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,472
ABOLISHING ICE ALSO WOULD MEAN 

356
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:06,779
MORE DRUGS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND 

357
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,481
ON OUR STREETS. 

358
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,784
LAST YEAR, ISIS SEIZED NEARLY A 

359
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,487
MILLION POUNDS OF FENTANYL AND 

360
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,924
OTHER--ICE SEIZED NEARLY A 

361
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,027
MILLION POUNDS OF PHENETOLE AND 

362
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,361
OTHER DRUGS. 

363
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:27,066
>> AS I MENTIONED LAST YEAR 518 

364
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,435
HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS 

365
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:34,740
NEARLY A THOUSAND VICTIMS OF 

366
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,140
EXPLOITATION IT. 

367
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,444
ABOLISHING WOULD GIVE A THAON 

368
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,144
EXPLOIT IMMIGRATION LOOP HOLES. 

369

00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,681
BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 

371
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,783
BECAUSE OF THE TIRELESS WORK OF 

372
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,086
ICE AND THE ENTIRE LAW

AND IT'S A RECORD OF 

385
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,050
ACCOMPLISHMENT AND SECURITY. 

386
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,886
