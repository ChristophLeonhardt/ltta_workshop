TALK SHOW COULD BE IN JEOPARDY.

3
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:15,291
HOWIE KURTZ JOINS US NOW.

4
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:17,827
>> MEGHAN KELLY HAS TALKED HER

5
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:19,962
WAY INTO BIG TROUBLE AND FOX

6
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,664
NEWS CAN NOW CONFIRM HER JOB

7
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:22,531
HOSTING THE THIRD HOUR OF THE

8
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,166
TODAY SHOW IS EXPECTED TO END

00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:27,503
PER HAPPENS IN THE NOT TOO

10
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:28,637
DISTANT FUTURE.

11
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:30,606
KELLY WAS ASKED TO STAY HOME

12
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:32,141
TODAY AND TOMORROW AFTER FIERCE

13
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:34,477
CRITICISM WHICH INSIDERS SAY WAS

14
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:36,445
ALMOST UNANIMOUS WITHIN NBC NEWS

15
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:38,681
OVER RACIALLY CHARGED REMARKS

16
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:41,183
SHE MADE OF ALL THINGS

17
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:41,550
HALLOWEEN.

18
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,886
>> WHAT IS RACIST?

19
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,387
YOU GET IN TROUBLE IF YOU ARE A

20
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:47,089
WHITE PERSON WHO PUTS ON BLACK

21
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,924
FACE OR BLACK PERSON WHO PUTS ON

22
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:51,427
WHITE FACE ON HALLOWEEN?

23
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:52,962
WHEN I WAS A KID THAT WAS OKAY

24
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:54,830
AS LONG AS YOU WERE DRESSED LIKE

25
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:56,031
A CHARACTER.

26
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:58,734
>> THAT LED TO AN APOLOGY FIRST

27
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,069
IN A LETTER TO HER COLLEAGUES

28
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,804
AND THEN HER VIEWERS.

29
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:03,706
>> I'M MEGYN KELLY.

30
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,708
I WANT TO BEGIN WITH TWO WORDS.

31
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:06,108
I'M SORRY.

32
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,077
I LEARNED THAT GIVEN THE HISTORY

33
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:09,945
OF BLACK FACE BEING USED IN

34
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:12,948
AWFUL WAYS BY RACIST IN THIS

35
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,350
COUNTRY, IT IS NOT OKAY FOR THAT

36
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:16,952
TO BE PART OF ANY COSTUME,

37
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:19,688
HALLOWEEN OR OTHERWISE.

38
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:24,727
>> A SERIES OF LEAKS IS SAYING

39
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:27,630
THAT ANDREW LACK HAS HAD

40
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,199
DISCUSSIONS WITH KELLY BY ENDING

41
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,902
HER SHOW BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

42
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:35,070
ALSO BLACK SAYING HE CONDEMNED

43
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,472
THE BLACK FACE REMARKS THAT HAVE

44
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:38,073
BEEN HEAVILY COVERED BY NBC.

45
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:39,975
THE FACT IS WHILE SHE APOLOGIZED

46
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,644
TO THE STAFF, SOME NBC STAFFERS

47
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,579
ARE STILL UPSET.

48
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,747
KELLY'S ALSO PARTED COMPANY WITH

49
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,182
HER TALENT AGENCY.

50
00:01:46,183 --> 00:01:48,317
IT WAS A HUGE STORY WHEN KELLY

51
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:49,385
LEFT FOX WHERE SHE WAS BEST

52
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:50,386
KNOWN FOR CLASHING WITH

53
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:51,987
PRESIDENT TRUMP AFTER ACCUSING

54
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,923
THE LATE CHAIRMAN OF SEXUALLY

55
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:54,957
HARASSING HER.

56
00:01:54,958 --> 00:00:00,000
DESPITE A $17 MILLION A YEAR
