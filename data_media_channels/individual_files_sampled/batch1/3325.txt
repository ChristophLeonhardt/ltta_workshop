SoulCycle is this really popular luxurious cycling brand that celebrities are known to frequent that has revolutionized boutique fitness it is very expensive and it's really leading boutique fitness right now people really enjoy that it feels like a party on a bike and not like a workout cloth the soul cycle hype is so real and it boggles my mind soul cycle does get criticism because some people say in their experience at soul cycle is not as good of a workout as it could be they say that their results aren't good so soul cycle does get its fair share of hate but I think that what they're doing is brilliant additionally it's incredibly expensive but to ride a bike for $34 when you also have to buy shoes and you strap in and you have the announcer going and candles burning it's fine but maybe you could also just go for a walk instead for free instead of paying $34 a lot of exercise scientists have said that a lot of the things that soul cycle does like push-ups on a bike are ineffective and also can be incredibly unsafe and damaging in the long run so let's Agel is also known as being sort of exclusionary it's full of thin beautiful people and if you're an average person you might not feel comfortable there the front row wholly front row and you want to have to work your way up to the front row the front row at soul cycle is the place to be that's like the adherence of the soul cycle culture which can be problematic if let's say you're not a model you don't have a six-pack and you just want to work out at the end of the day the average American just wants to pay $20 and belong to maybe blink or Planet Fitness or even above that is New York Sports Club so this could challenge soul cycle because a soul cycle tries to appeal to the masses after it goes public they could have trouble attracting the average everyday person I think that flywheel could potentially be a threat to SoulCycle which has several things that soul cycle doesn't have in a stadium seating so no matter where you're sitting it's not a bad seat there's free shoes free water at the end of the day there's room in the market for both of them you're going to have your type a flywheel people who want to do the races who want to see how they stack up in the leaderboard you're going to have the people who want the dancey fun workout party
