if you're a lover of animals you might want to get outside and go appreciate them while you still can because it turns out while no one's really been paying that much attention we're running out of animals in this world according to a new report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London their conclusion and this is a big one the number of animals living on land has fallen by 40% in the past four and a half decades we've lost almost one out of every two animals everywhere around the world marine animal populations have also fallen by 40 percent overall with Turtles suffering in particular some turtle populations are down 80% or more but Turtles are just one of them were talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of species being not just decimated but decimated multiple times over the biggest declines and animal numbers apparently come in low incomes developing nations perhaps for obvious reasons while conservation efforts enriched rich nations have seen small improvements overall but importantly the big declines in wildlife and rich nations had already occurred long before the new reports baseline year of 1970 they specifically cite the fact that apparently back in like 1860 or but have been 1680 the last wolf was shot in the UK I never knew that they had wolves and so we're starting to do a little bit to stabilize now in the rich countries but unfortunately we already had hundreds of years of massive exploitation of animals both on land and in the water by the way I said I'm sorry I do have that fact for you and I also was drawn to that either there was a really interesting fact the last wolf was shot in England in 1680 1680 by a Lannister no he was a little he's a little bastard but God no but it was 1680s so the so-called developed countries had already wiped out a lot of these animals earlier so now that's why it's happening more in the developing world yeah and so a little bit more info the fastest decline among animal populations were found in freshwater ecosystems where numbers have plummeted by 75 percent since 1970 so there's basically no fish left in freshwater ecosystems at point and so the way that they did this was they looked at ten thousand different animal populations covering three thousand species in total to give them a sort of map of different animal populations around the globe and they have some ideas about what's what's causing this like our overall that amount that we're taking out of the environment versus what we're giving back they said this currently the global population is cutting down trees faster than they regrow catching fish faster than the oceans restock pumping water from rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more climate warming carbon dioxide than oceans and forests can absorb Kathleen and they said that the that today's average global rate of consumption would need 1.5 planet Earth's to sustain it but if we all were taking in stuff the way we do in the US it would take for planet Earth's to sustain that and so this is I mean it's like you almost feel like it can't possibly be true but 40 percent of the animals there it's absolutely devastating and it makes clear how drastic the need to do whatever we can to to stabilize and help other countries to those with less resources to do it I was lucky enough last year I chaired a panel for the Tyler prizes big environmental prize and one of the speakers there was a woman named Jane Lubchenco who had been the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association under our organization under Obama and she talked about all the work they had done to help fisheries around like the the big fishing areas around the globe to renew themselves and they've had a lot of success but that sort of effort is not like you can't do it for a year it takes decades of sustained effort and international diplomacy to do it and that's why when you you have someone like Trump who comes and who doesn't believe they think the industry should just move in and exploit stuff as much as they want and they have no interest in working with other countries to do this we can't do this alone and we can't do it slowly and we certainly can't wait so to John's point about how sometimes if we actually try we can replenish Tigers have replenish in Nepal and otters have been replenished in the UK but you actually have to try and sew on the otter hand okay I I'm not your typical liberal and and I've had a very slow transition over a number of years now well-documented from a Republican to liberal and and I I so I want to do a bumper sticker that says save the humans so I might come out on a different area of the spectrum than a lot of liberals or progressives on this issue and and I get that as the world changes you can't preserve the past completely and and so on some old sites some neighborhoods also some animals we can't just keep the world in a jar and have it not at all adapt to our tremendous rate of growth and and the world's population has gone up fourfold in the last century I believe that's also yeah population has risen full fourfold in the last century so that's a gigantic increase by humans right and and I'm for the humans that's why people like Bill O'Reilly calling me a secular humanist guilty as charged now on the other hand you just saw the stuff that John read you that's not sustainable so if we're burning things back quickly we're going to run out of trees and then guess what happens we then run out of humans yeah so if we're the the freshwater ecosystem the numbers they're plotted plummeted by seventy five percent since nineteen seventy at some point we're gonna get ourselves in a world of trouble here because once you start running out of food you start running out of water yeah I mean we did a story last week Cape Town on the first see South Paulo and Brazil among the first two cities running out of water and then we're gonna have Wars like we've never seen yeah and that population is going to get decreased so if even if you're one of those guys who was like I don't care about the honors that's their problem not my problem and good riddance to the Wolves you don't need them by the way you should watch this great little video on how the wolves brought back yeah I think is Yellowstone are you seventy one of those parks they reintroduce wolves into the park and they had such a profound effect and helped the rest of the ecology it was amazing so amazing to watch yeah anyway that that documentary got poor ratings from deer the deer we're eating every day all the vegetation moves down they even move the rivers the Wolves did wolf dash pack.com I think is where you can see or maybe that's a different world but anyway but guys we got to get this under control even if you don't care about the animals and you don't care about the environment that reckoning is coming straight towards us yeah we cannot continue to burn resources at one-and-a-half times what the world can support and then hope for the best because you ain't gonna get the best you're gonna get the worst you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
