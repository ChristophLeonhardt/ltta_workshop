00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:10,578
>> Laura: TIME NOW FOR OUR

2
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:11,979
SEEN AND UNSEEN SEGMENT WHERE WE

3
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,481
EXPOSE WHAT'S REALLY BEHIND THE

4
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:16,584
BIG CULTURAL STORIES OF THE DAY.

5
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:20,488
CNN MAY HAVE TO ISSUE A MAJOR

6
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,490
ATTRACTION AFTER THEY CHARGED

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,357
MORGAN FREEMAN WITH

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:23,858
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

9
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,460
AND WOULD YOU PAY MORE THAN A

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,296
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A T-SHIRT?

11
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,330
NO.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,066
HERE TO EXPLAIN IT IS AUTHOR OF

13
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:36,504
A BEST-SELLING SERIES, RAYMOND

14
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:40,475
ARROYO.

15
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,409
SO MORGAN FREEMAN IS AN

16
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:44,745
ACADEMY AWARD WINNER.

17
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:50,151
SHE WROTE A PIECE EXPOSING AND

18
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,719
CHARGING MORGAN FREEMAN WITH

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,220
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,888
SHE CLAIMED SHE WAS ON A JUNKET

21
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,323
INTERVIEWING FREEMAN AND IN THE

22
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:56,357
MIDDLE OF THE INTERVIEW, HE

23
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:59,293
LOOKED OVER AND SAID, OH, I WISH

24
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,695
I WERE THERE.

25
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:03,197
AND LOOK TOWARD HER.

26
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,465
SHE WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME AND

27
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,336
SHE TOOK THAT AS

28
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,137
AND HE SAID HE WAS TALKING TO

29
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,539
MICHAEL CAINE WHO TALKED ABOUT

30
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,473
GOING TO SOME LOCALE.

31
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:16,644
HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE

32
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,311
ENTIRE REPORT.

33
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,880
WHY ARE THEY ALLOWED TO WRITE

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,952
THE PIECE BY CNN?

35
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,823
AND, THIS IS A ME TOO MOVEMENT

36
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:32,193
WHICH IS EXPOSING SOME REAL

37
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:35,596
ABUSES, BUT THIS -- WHEN YOU SAY

38
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,632
SOMETHING LIKE, YOU ARE LOOKING

39
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:41,269
AT ME, IT'S LIKE KIDS SAYING,

40
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:42,970
MARIA IS LOOKING AT ME, STOP

41
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,705
LOOKING AT ME.

42
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,908
THEN TEN YEARS LATER IT'S

43
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,376
INAPPROPRIATE HUGS AND ALL THAT.

44
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:51,312
>> FREEMAN IS NOW SAYING THROUGH

45
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,881
HIS LAWYER, THIS IS DEFAMATION,

46
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,350
AND IN THIS AGE OF WHEN YOU HAVE

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,119
A BLACK CELEBRITY LIKE THIS AT

48
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,156
THIS LEVEL, I THINK AND CNN HAS.

49
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:08,329
>> Laura: NOW ROSEANNE, THE

50
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,131
PROBLEM IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS

51
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,099
A TOXIC PRESIDENT WHO AMASSED

52
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,070
HIS POWER THROUGH PROVOCATION OF

53
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,906
HATE.

54
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,308
AND THE TRUMP SUPPORTER

55
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,175
NORMALIZES RACISM AND MISOGYNY,

56
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,577
AND OF COURSE THROW IT IN FOR

57
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:25,212
GOOD MEASURE, SEEN A PHOBIA.

58
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,082
SO HAVING A CHARACTER ON THE

59
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:31,118
SHOW WHO SUPPORTS TRUMP, IS

60
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,653
RACISM AND MISOGYNY?

61
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,322
>> WE ARE'S SEEING BLANKET

62
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:38,793
RACISM BEING THROWN AROUND, AND

63
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:39,794
PEOPLE ARE CONFUSING

64
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:40,461
ROSEANNE BARR THE ACTOR AND

65
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,397
ROSEANN CONNOR WHO PLAYS ROSEANN

66
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,298
ON TV.

67
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,301
ROSEANN DID ITS JOB.

68
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,903
IT AWAKENED AT THE ENTERTAINMENT

69
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,104
COMMUNITY.

70
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,106
IT WAS OF MIDDLE AMERICA,

71
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:52,840
UNDERSERVED AND THEY WERE

72
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,642
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BE THEIR

73
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:55,109
VOICE TO.

74
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,913
WE WILL SEE IT IN OTHER

75
00:02:58,913 --> 00:02:59,480
CHARACTERS, SO WATCH.

76
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,115
>> Laura: THERE IS TOO MUCH

77
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,517
MONEY TO BE MADE TO.

78
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,554
AND GIVING A VOICE TO SOMEONE

79
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,656
WHO IS NOT DEMONIZED EVERY FIVE

80
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,290
SECONDS.

81
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,991
THEY ARE STILL DEMONIZING THE

82
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:16,130
TRUMP SUPPORT AS            ANDS

83
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,163
TRUMP SUPPORT AS            ANDP

TRUMP SUPPORT AS            AND.

88
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,232
NOW, JESSE DUPLANTIS, I HAVE

89
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,167
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

90
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:27,008
>> HE'S FROM MY NECK OF THE

91
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,909
WORDS IN LOUISIANA.

92
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,879
>> Laura: IS A WHAT IS HE

93
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,213
SAYING?

94
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,616
>> HE SAYS THE LORD HAS CALLED

95
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,618
HIM TO HAVE ANOTHER PRIVATE JET.

96
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:42,223
>> YOU KNOW, HE SAID I CAN DO IT

97
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:42,657
FROM ONE SPOT.

98
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,892
I BELIEVE IF JESUS WAS

99
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,328
PHYSICALLY ON THE EARTH TODAY,

100
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,096
HE WOULDN'T BE RIDING A DONKEY.

101
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,098
>> WHEN THE LORD SAID SORT OF

102
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,199
YOUR RICHES IN HEAVEN, I DON'T

103
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,801
THINK THIS IS WHAT HE HAD IN

104
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,705
THIS GUY IS ASKING $54 MILLION

105
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,674
FROM HIS FOLLOWERS FOR A FOURTH

106
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:05,079
PRIVATE JET.

107
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,116
>> Laura: WOULD IT BE G4?

108
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,352
>> KENNETH COPELAND ALSO HAD A

109
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,721
PRIVATE PLANES, AND THEY ARE ON

110
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,322
TV, DEFENDING WHY THEY NEED

111
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,224
PRIVATE PLANES.

112
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,459
>> WHAT'S THAT THING ABOUT

113
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,532
GETTING A RICH PERSON?

114
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:27,968
>> WATCH.

115
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,503
WE CAN'T GET HERE WITHOUT THIS,

116
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,939
WE GOT TO HAVE THIS.

117
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,908
I WOULD HAVE TO STOP.

118
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:36,110
I'M BEING VERY CONSERVATIVE, AT

119
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,813
LEAST 75-80, MORE LIKE 90% OF

120
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,514
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

121
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,583
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET THEM HERE.

122
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,351
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

123
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:48,723
>> THEY DON'T LIKE COMMERCIAL

124
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:53,260
AIRLINES, AND, I WILL LEAVE IT

125
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,097
