Oh secret you need money to win a political race if you're an American politician donation is key but don't fret there are always business sharks happy to support your cause you just have to find your match and here are the lucky ones who already did the New York Governor for instance was blessed with $100,000 from the coffers of the Winklevoss twins cofounders of Facebook and now cryptocurrency moguls what an act of generosity of good faith and what an act of good faith from the New York authorities approving the cryptocurrency exchange for the twins correlation doesn't mean causation of course but there's a clear countrywide pattern here in Florida to equity firms donated to the campaign of the incumbent governor and later those same firms were approved a two hundred and fifty million dollar investment from the state's pension fund surely completely unrelated to their generous donation a Tennessee member of Congress is accused of setting up a study to keep an emissions law loophole in tax which serves business interests of a truck dealership which yes donated to her campaign and while the quid-pro-quo relationships above can only be seen as allegations the next one is a taped confession is it bad public policy between and I can what you've just heard is reportedly a Georgia governor candidate admitting he back to bill he himself realized was disastrous just to make sure his opponent doesn't get the money from a lobbying firm to fund his campaign what is an open secret as well is that a lobbyist job is to pay the right people otherwise those people won't even listen to them we had hierarchy in my office in Congress if you were a lobbyist who never gave us money I didn't talk to you if your lobbyists who gave us money I might talk to you of course businesses will give assurances left and right that they get into politics because they care but practice shows those bedfellows up shall we say more than cozy you
