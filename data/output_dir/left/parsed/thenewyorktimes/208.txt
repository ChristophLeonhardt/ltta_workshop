Hi, I’m Ben Falcone,
the director
of “Life of the Party."
So this is the scene where
there’s an ‘80s party.
And we really wanted to get a
nice response of them coming in
in a true ‘80s style.
The costumes, Melissa had
a lot of influence in.
You can see that our
heroes are "Dynasty,"
and the other girls
are more aerobics.
And these costumes,
if you look at them,
Melissa helped pick them
out and ordered them.
And then our costume
designer, Louise Mingenbach,
helped add things to them.
But look at their hair.
One thing to note
is that all of them
needed extra hair to really
‘80s out as much as we are here,
except for Jessie Enis,
who’s the great actress
in the green dress.
So that’s all her own real hair.
And then we’ve got a Miami Vice.
And then we’ve got — what is
Jimmy O. Yang doing there?
He’s all over the place
‘80s, which actually I think
hits his character pretty well.
This scene is a little bit
of a throwback, I hope.
And the whole movie, actually,
is a little bit of a throwback,
because our main
character is a throwback.
Deana, right?
She’s played by Melissa.
She’s the woman.
She goes back to school
with her own daughter.
And we wanted this
to feel like some
of these comedies from the
‘80s that we love so much.
We also wanted it
to look like film.
Melissa and I really love film.
And Julio Macat,
our cinematographer,
did a great job with that.
Here, Melissa, here’s a song
she’s about to go dance.
And she worked so
hard on this dance.
People seemed to
really enjoy it.
"I know this one."
"No, Mom."
"I know this one!"
Melissa really likes to dance.
And she was really nervous
about shooting the scene.
And this was actually a really
technically tricky scene
to shoot.
I hope that the audience can
see the joy that’s in the scene.
But it actually took a
lot of technical elements
from the camera side, and
certainly on Melissa’s side.
And we had a lot of
great dancers there.
Our choreographer, Twitch,
from the Ellen show,
choreographed this
dance with Melissa.
She practiced on the weekends
and really worked hard
on this dance to make this funny
dance that seems so casual.
She worked on it incredibly
hard for weekends and weekends
on end.
"It's a car!"
" Yes, I can see that!"
"Oh, yes, Mom."
"What a woman!"
I guess it’s sort of like
a fight scene, right?
But it’s a dance fight.
And there’s Debbie Ryan.
She plays that
character who is always
trying to sort of denigrate
someone else, probably
because she feels vulnerable
and not great about herself.
And then Melissa comes in
and does the worm, which
sort of wins the dance battle.
The worm is not easy.
It’s sort of a
physical training.
I mean, doing the worm —
I can’t do it.
