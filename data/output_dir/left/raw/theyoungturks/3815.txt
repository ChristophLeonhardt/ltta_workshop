1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,100
NEW REPORTS INDICATE THAT A
LOCATION SCOUT FOR THE NETFLIX

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,500
SERIES NARCOS WAS TRAGICALLY
MURDERED WHILE HE WAS IN MEXICO.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,740
HE WAS SCOUTING SPECIFICALLY FOR
THE FOURTH SEASON OF NARCOS

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,210
AND HIS BULLET RIDDLED BODY WAS
FOUND IN AN AREA OF MEXICO

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,300
THAT'S KNOWN FOR CARTEL
VIOLENCE.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:48,190
THIS IS CARLOS MUNOZ PORTAL.

7
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,190
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE
PRODUCERS OF NARCOS PLAN ON

8
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,250
CONTINUING WITH THE MEXICO FOCUSED
SEASON FOUR PLANS, BUT THIS IS AN

9
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,540
INCREDIBLY TRAGIC STORY.

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,090
MY HEART GOES OUT TO HIM AND HIS
FAMILY.

11
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,749
IT IS SO WEIRD HOW THE POWER
OF THE CARTELS EXTENDS ñ

12
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:14,149
FIRST OF ALL, MEXICO AS YOU
KNOW, THESE FORMERLY

13
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:16,979
BEAUTIFUL TOURIST AREAS, IíM
THINKING ACAPULCO THAT

14
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,020
THEY SAY SORT OF THE RIVIERA OF
LATIN AMERICA, IT HAS A

15
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,490
REPUTATION OF BEING A PLACE
PEOPLE GO FOR HONEYMOON.

16
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,609
YOU CANíT EVEN GO THERE OFTEN
TIMES.

17
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:30,229
I'M READING ABOUT MORE AND MORE
VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS.

18
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:33,420
MORE TO THE POINT HERE, THE IDEA
THAT THE CARTELS COULD BE

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,850
SO ATTUNED TO THE MEDIA THEY'RE
GETTING TO THE POINT WERE

20
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,939
THEY WOULD WANT TO MURDER THIS
GUY.

21
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,359
THIS IS A LOCATION MANAGER.

22
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,409
HE'S NOT SOME HIGH-END PRODUCER
WHO IS THE CREATOR OF THE

23
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,060
SHOW, HE'S REALLY SORT OF A FOOT
SOLDIER AND IT DOES SEND A

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,509
MESSAGE.

25
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,689
IT'S A FRIGHTENING MESSAGE AND
IT'S A FRIGHTENING SCENARIO

26
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,999
THAT'S BEING PLAYED OUT IN THIS
COUNTRY AND IT'S BY THE WAY

27
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:58,139
REFLECTIVE AS I SAY OF WHAT'S
GOING ON THROUGHOUT MEXICO

28
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:01,420
IN RELATION TO THE CARTELS.

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,549
EXACTLY.

30
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,299
RIGHT NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE
AREN'T ANY WITNESSES.

31
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,489
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE VERY FEW
LEADS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT

32
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:20,790
JUSTICE FOR HIM, BUT WHAT'S
AMAZING TO ME IS THAT THEY

33
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,640
WENT TO A CRIME RIDDEN PART OF
MEXICO IN ORDER TO CONSIDER

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,060
FILMING THERE.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,379
DON'T DO THAT.

36
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,970
THERE IS SOME SUSPICION THAT
CARTELS MIGHT HAVE TARGETED

37
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,290
HIM BECAUSE THEY SAW HIM WITH A
CAMERA AND SO THEY MIGHT OF

38
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,450
THOUGHT, OKAY, HE MIGHT BE
TRYING TO FIND INFORMATION

39
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,450
ON US.

40
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,349
HE MIGHT TRY TO REPORT AS TO
AUTHORITIES.

41
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,879
WHO KNOWS.

42
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,709
SO IT'S SUSPECTED OR AT LEAST
THEORIZED THAT HE MIGHT NOT

43
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,140
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OF KNOWN HE
WAS ATTACHED TO THIS PRODUCTION.

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,140
RIGHT.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
HOW WOULD THEY KNOW?

46
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,069
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY
KNEW, BUT IT'S SUCH A

47
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,050
DEVASTATING STORY.

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,230
IF ANYTHING, IT SHOULD MAKE
PEOPLE REALIZE THAT WHEN

49
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,980
INDIVIDUALS ARE FLING PARTS OF
MEXICO, THEY ARE NOT DOING

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,489
IT TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES
TO START TROUBLE.

51
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,420
IN A LOT OF CASES THEY ARE DOING
IT FOR A COURSE ECONOMIC

52
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,110
REASONS BUT ALSO TO ESCAPE
VIOLENCE AND RIGHT NOW,

53
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,680
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS COMING
IN FROM MEXICO IS AT AN

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,090
ALL-TIME LOW, BUT PEOPLE TRYING
TO COME IN FROM PLACES LIKE

55
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,420
EL SALVADOR AND HONDURAS, THAT'S
UP BECAUSE OF CRIME THAT'S

56
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,859
PARTLY FUELED BY OUR WAR ON
DRUGS.

57
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,160
WE HAVE EMPOWERED THESE CARTELS
TO THE POINT WHERE THEY

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,000
HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL
THAN AUTHORITIES IN THOSE

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,659
COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE INNOCENT
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO

60
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,810
FLEE THE VIOLENCE THAT THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR SAFETY AND THEY WANT

61
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,890
TO SAVE THE KIDS FOR MURDER AND
THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY'RE

62
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,150
TRYING TO GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES
AND AN UNDOCUMENTED FASHION.

63
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,280
WHAT ANNA IS TALKING ABOUT IS
SO TRUE.

64
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,659
THE STREAM OF REFUGEES FROM
VIOLENCE.

65
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,060
THIS IS RAPE AND MURDER GOING ON
IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THEIR

66
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,640
PASSING THROUGH MEXICO ON THE
WAY HERE AND THEY COME ON TOP

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,700
OF THESE TRAINS IF YOU HAVEN'T
GONE ONLINE, YOU CAN SEE IT.

68
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,370
THESE KIDS THAT ARE HUDDLED ON
TOP OF THE TRAIN AS IT GOES

69
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,430
HUNDREDS OF MILES.

70
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,180
YEAH, WHAT'S DRIVING IMMIGRATION
AGAIN, FROM CENTRAL AMERICA

71
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,789
IS NOT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY EVEN
SO MUCH ANYMORE.

72
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,729
THERE IS LESS AND LESS OF THAT
IN THIS COUNTRY AS YOU KNOW

73
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,130
BUT IT'S THE FEAR OF DEATH, THE
FEAR MURDER.

74
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,490
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE
MEXICO NEVER FELT THAT I NEEDED

75
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,260
TO SECURE ITS SOUTHERN BORDER
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY

76
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,940
ARE NOTICING THIS INFLUX OF
REFUGEES ESSENTIALLY FROM

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,810
CENTRAL AMERICA POURING IN THEIR
COUNTRY SO THEY ALL OF A SUDDEN

78
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,479
ARE DEALING WITH NOT A SIMILAR
ISSUE, BUT IMMIGRATION

79
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,430
POLICY QUESTIONS THAT THE US HAS
HAD TO FACE.

80
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,440
IT'S ALL PRETTY INTERESTING
STUFF AND AGAIN, MY HEART GOES

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,900
OUT TO THIS POOR GUYS FAMILY AND
IT IS OKAY TO SHOOT THE SHOW IN

82
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,610
NEW MEXICO OR ARIZONA OR A PLACE
THAT KIND OF MAYBE YOU CAN

83
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,090
MAKE LIKE MEXICO.

84
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,509
MY FRIEND JUST HAD TO SHOW ALL
ABOUT A ROCK AND A SHOT IN

85
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:12,509
NEW MEXICO.

86
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:14,020
NEW MEXICO DOUBLES FOR MY SCHOOL
ALL THE TIME.

87
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,419
THIS IS A KIND OF THING, IF THEY
ARE IN ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT,

88
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,071
WE WENT OUT AN TO SHUT IN MEXICO
AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU, THAT

89
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,930
PLACE IS NO PARTY BUT WE WANTED
TO HAVE A NOT THEN TAKE FIELD.

90
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,729
DON'T RISK PEOPLE'S LIVES.

91
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:31,449
MOVE THE PRODUCTION TO NEW
MEXICO AND HIRE A BUNCH OF

92
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,990
AUTHENTIC PEOPLE.

93
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,280
THAT IS THE HOLLYWOOD IS.

94
00:05:40,280 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS CASTING.
