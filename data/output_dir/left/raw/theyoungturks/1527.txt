1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:24,790
NEW INFORMATION COMING
FROM DODD-FRANK REGULATIONS.

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,939
NOW WHAT DOES IT DO?

3
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:32,079
IT RAISES THE THRESHOLD TO $250
BILLION OF FROM $50 BILLION

4
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,440
UNDER WHICH BANKS ARE DEEMED TOO
IMPORTANT TO THE FINANCIAL

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,070
SYSTEM TO FAIL, SO THOSE
INSTITUTIONS ALSO WOULD NOT

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,760
HAVE TO UNDERGO STRESS TESTS OR
SUBMIT SO-CALLED LIVING WILLS.

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,210
BOTH SAFETY VALVES THAT
WERE PLANNED FOR FINANCIAL

8
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,860
DISASTER, SO THE

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,950
SMALLER THE BANK IS, THE LESS IT
HAS TO COMPLY WITH THESE

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,500
REGULATIONS SO THE REGULATIONS
DON'T NECESSARILY APPLY TO

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
THEM AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAS
HAPPENED NOW WITH

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,189
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IS THAT SOME
OF THESE REGULATIONS WOULD

13
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,009
BE LIFTED FOR MIDSIZED BANKS.

14
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,960
THE WAY OUR POLITICIANS ARE
SELLING IT TO US IS THIS IS

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,600
GOING TO HELP THE SMALL BANKS,
THE COMMUNITY BANKS.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,350
NO, THIS IS REALLY ABOUT
MIDSIZED BANKS THAT DID NOT

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,799
WANT TO DEAL WITH THE
REGULATIONS, DID NOT WANT TO

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,049
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT
WHEN IT CAME TO SHADY LENDING

19
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,039
PRACTICES AND SHADY BETS WHEN IT
CAME TO OUR MONEY AND OUR

20
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:34,259
DEPOSITS AND NOW SOME OF THOSE
RESTRICTIONS WILL BE LIFTED.

21
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,350
TWO PARTS TO THIS STORY.

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,369
ONE IS ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT IS
AFFECTED IS BLACKROCK,

23
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,009
POSITIVELY, SO THEY ARE A GIANT
INVESTMENT FIRM SO IT LOOKS LIKE

24
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,479
THEIR GIFTS TO THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY WORKED OUT GREAT.

25
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
UNSURPRISINGLY, THEY FOUND
THEMSELVES A LOOPHOLE.

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,039
I THOUGHT TRUMP WAS GOING TO
CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES?

27
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,850
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GO
AFTER THE HEDGE FUND

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,959
GUYS AND THE PRIVATE EQUITY
GUYS?

29
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,409
INSTEAD HE HAS GONE AFTER THEM
WITH GIFTS.

30
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,509
HERE, HAVE MORE MONEY AND MORE
DEREGULATION.

31
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,000
DODD-FRANK WAS, IN MY OPINION, A
PRETTY WEAK SET OF REGULATIONS

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,310
ON THE BANKS AND NOW THEY HAVE
GUTTED EVEN THOSE WEAK

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,750
REGULATIONS.

34
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,280
IN A PRESS CONFERENCE TRUMP
SAID THE DODD-FRANK WAS A

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,830
DISASTER.

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,170
DURING THE CAMPAIGN, HE RAN
AGAINST, IF YOU REMEMBER

37
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,210
ALL THE ADS, THE GLOBAL
FINANCIAL ELITES.

38
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,570
THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL ELITES HATE
DODD-FRANK, THEY CALL IT A

39
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,540
DISASTER BECAUSE IT PREVENTS
THEM FROM TAKING MORE RISK

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,780
WHICH IN THE SHORT TERM GIVES
THEM A LOT MORE MONEY.

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,230
IN THE LONG-TERM IT CRASHES THE
ECONOMY BUT THAT IS OKAY

42
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,450
BECAUSE WE PAY FOR THAT, THEY
DON'T.

43
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,760
IT'S PRIVATIZING THE GAINS,
SOCIALIZING THE LOSSES.

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,070
SO WHO IS DONALD TRUMP WORKING
FOR NOW?

45
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,730
THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL ELITES.

46
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,730
WHY?

47
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,250
BECAUSE THEY ARE FUNNELING MONEY
TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND TO THE

48
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,530
REPUBLICAN PARTY OVERALL.

49
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,680
THEY DID A LITTLE BIT IN THE
LAST ELECTION, THEY ARE

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,930
DOING IT IN RECORD NUMBERS NOW.

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,590
THE SECOND PART OF THE STORY IS
CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS.

52
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,540
ONE OF THEM WAS OF THE CEREMONY,
HEIDI HEITKAMP FROM NORTH

53
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,650
DAKOTA.

54
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,380
OTHERS HAD SIGNED ONTO THE
LEGISLATION AND THOUGHT THEY

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,990
WOULD GET CREDIT FROM TRUMP
BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE IN RED

56
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,930
STATES AND THEY ARE UP FOR
REELECTION SO THEY WANT A PHOTO

57
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,950
OPPORTUNITY WITH TRUMP WHICH, BY
THE WAY ,IS PATHETIC.

58
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,660
BE A MAN, AND ACTUALLY BE A
STRONG CANDIDATE AND YOUR

59
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,121
VOTERS MIGHT ACTUALLY RESPECT
YOU AND WHY THEY VOTED FOR

60
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,390
TRUMP IN THE FIRST PLACE, HE AT
LEAST HAD THE APPEARANCE OF

61
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,690
HONESTY, IT WAS TOTALLY WRONG
BUT HE GAVE THAT APPEARANCE

62
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,570
OF I'M JUST BLURTING OUT THINGS,
I MUST BE HONEST BECAUSE I AM

63
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,580
OBVIOUSLY NOT POLISHED.

64
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,210
THESE GUYS DON'T LEARN THAT
LESSON, WHAT THEY LEARN IS

65
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,420
I WILL KISS TRUMP'S ASS AND
MAYBE THAT WILL MAKE THE RED

66
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,670
STATE VOTERS RESPECT ME.

67
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,150
IT IS REALLY ONE OF THE SADDEST
THINGS I HAVE EVER HEARD.

68
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,760
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,120
TRUMP DID NOT INVITE THEM
ANYWAY.

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,660
IT IS GREAT.

71
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,230
I AM GLAD THAT HE DIDN'T INVITE
THEM AND I'M GLAD THAT THEY

72
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,110
DIDN'T GET THE CREDIT THAT THEY
WANTED.

73
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,490
TRUMP MADE A FEW STATEMENTS
ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS HELP TO MAKE

74
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,440
THIS BIPARTISAN EFFORT POSSIBLE
AND I WILL READ YOU THOSE QUOTES

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,510
IN JUST A SECOND, BUT UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH OF A MISCALCULATION

76
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,040
THIS WAS WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,500
TO THESE BIG BANKS, I WOULD
ARGUE THAT BOTH DEMOCRATS AND

78
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,780
REPUBLICANS ARE RELATIVELY
UNITED ON THE ISSUE.

79
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,630
I THINK THAT EVERYONE IS PRETTY
FRUSTRATED AT WHAT HAPPENED

80
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,790
WITH THE BAILOUTS.

81
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,040
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THE SHADY
PRACTICES OF WALL STREET.

82
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,160
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THESE
BANKERS ARE INCREDIBLY GREEDY SO

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,440
LOOK, DEREGULATION HAS BEEN
DEFAMED LEFT AND RIGHT BUT I

84
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,500
THINK MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

85
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,770
REGULATION PUT IN PLACE SO US
TAXPAYERS AREN'T PAYING FOR

86
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,210
THEIR BAILOUT AGAIN IN THE
FUTURE AND SO A GOOD WAY OF

87
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,650
PLAYING THIS AS A DEMOCRAT WOULD
BE HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

88
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,060
THAT BAILOUT WAS RIDICULOUS.

89
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,650
WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT BAILOUT
IN THE FUTURE BUT INSTEAD

90
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,490
THEY WENT AHEAD AND SIGNED ONTO
THIS CRAZY DEREGULATION

91
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,580
EFFORT ANYWAY AND BY
THE WAY, IT WAS 17

92
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,850
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO VOTED IN
FAVOR OF SCALING DODD-FRANK

93
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,510
BACK AND 33 HOUSE DEMOCRATS WHO
SUPPORTED IT.

94
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,870
IN FACT, EVEN BARNEY FRANK
OF DODD-FRANK, HE IS THAT

95
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,450
FRANK, WHEN INTERVIEWED BY THE
YOUNG TURKS SAID WHAT DO

96
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,450
YOU WANT US TO DO?

97
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,620
NOT TAKE BANKER MONEY?

98
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,810
HE SAID WE SHOULD AT LEAST GET
20% OF THE BANKER MONEY.

99
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,169
WHAT A PATHETIC STRATEGY,
CONSIGNED TO LOSING FOR THE

100
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,169
REST OF TIME.

101
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,169
EXCUSE ME.

102
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,230
SO FINALLY, ON THAT SENATE
BANKING COMMITTEE OUT OF THE 17

103
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:49,280
DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED FOR IT

104
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,300
ARE SENATORS WHO HAVEN'T

105
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,330
MET BANKER ASS THEY WOULDN'T
LOVE TO MAKE OUT WITH SO

106
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,639
DONNELLY WAS

107
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,230
LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING OUT
WITH DONALD TRUMP TOO AND HE WAS

108
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,370
THE ONE WHO WAS FELT MOST
AGRIEVED THAT HE DIDN'T GET AN

109
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,370
INVITE.

110
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,350
HE SAYS I WAS TOLD BY THE WHITE
HOUSE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE

111
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,260
RECEIVING AN INVITATION, HIS
AIDE SAID THIS, DUE TO

112
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,419
SPACE CONSTRAINTS BUT THEY NOTED
THERE WAS ACTUALLY TWO DOZEN

113
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,419
PEOPLE THERE SO THERE MIGHT NOT
OF BEEN SPACE CONSTRAINTS.

114
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,419
YOU THINK?

115
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,419
OF COURSE.

116
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,830
THEY LEFT YOU OUT ON PURPOSE.

117
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,521
DID YOU THINK BY KISSING
REPUBLICAN ASS THEY WOULD

118
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:24,521
TAKE IT EASY ON YOU?

119
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:27,500
DID YOU THINK THEY WERE EVER
GOING TO BE LIKE, LET'S LET JOE

120
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
DONNELLY

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,550
KEEP THAT SEAT IN INDIANA.

122
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,300
NO, THEY'RE GOING TO COME FOR
YOU AND THEY ARE GOING TO

123
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
BE VICIOUS.

124
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,920
YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE
YOU CREDIT FOR WORKING WITH

125
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,320
TRUMP?

126
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,590
YOU THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO CALL YOU MODERATE?

127
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,590
NO.

128
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,900
THEY ARE GOING TO CALL YOU AN
OUT-OF-CONTROL LIBERAL

129
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
MARXIST.

130
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,480
THEY ARE GOING TO RIP YOUR FACE
OFF AND YOU WANTED TO GO TO

131
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
KISS TRUMP'S ASS.

132
00:06:50,480 --> 00:00:00,000
HOW IS THAT STRATEGY WORKING OUT
FOR YOU NOW?
