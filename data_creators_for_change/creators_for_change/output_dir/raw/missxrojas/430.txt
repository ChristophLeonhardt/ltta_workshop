1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
stupid part is the part where I decided

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,210
to serve myself some strawberry frozen

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,830
yogurt just<font color="#E5E5E5"> before a comment to make the</font>

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,000
video so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just gonna have to eat</font>

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I hope that's okay</font>

6
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,639
today I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a little bit by the</font>

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,290
rioting this going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Britain because</font>

8
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,190
of everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been going on oh</font>

9
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,300
man I've haven't really been keeping up

10
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,889
with the news as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as I might be when</font>

11
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">people start setting your home town on</font>

12
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,279
fire it kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes you shut up and</font>

13
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,050
listen a little bit firstly just explain

14
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,390
I feel like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are merging two very</font>

15
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,010
different events earlier this week there

16
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,529
was a protest about 200-300 people after

17
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,660
police shot mark duggan people aren't

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">entirely sure why I mean there's some</font>

19
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,689
talk that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was carrying like a replica</font>

20
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,098
gun<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things like that i was kind of</font>

21
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,079
outrage and a very peaceful protest

22
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,390
about that and then rioters and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

23
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,100
more actively violent people came in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

24
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">took over that protest and turned it</font>

25
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a riot later that evening so i</font>

26
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,379
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really think it's fair to say that</font>

27
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people who are rioting are really</font>

28
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,430
associated with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

29
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,140
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that there's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

30
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,940
discomfort about the way the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

31
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,710
acted especially during the student

32
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,270
riots there was a lot of what i would

33
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,190
call police brutality but not everyone

34
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,750
would feel comfortable doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

35
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,730
said I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> spike pretty much all of</font>

36
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,750
the action that people have taken

37
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,300
against policemen and women in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past</font>

38
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,000
few days has been really awful and not

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,040
even to get me started<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the fire men</font>

40
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,479
and women as well you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked</font>

41
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,830
and had missiles turned at them and

42
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,439
ambulances and paramedics and all these

43
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,299
things like it's it's horrendous and if

44
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,070
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people it's really black and</font>

45
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,390
white<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not necessarily in a bad way</font>

46
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,979
to their moves like this destruction is

47
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,810
happening it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bad it needs to stop</font>

48
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,310
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated because the way</font>

49
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,470
it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> reported sort of makes me</font>

50
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,759
uncomfortable sometimes I feel like

51
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,220
almost every person who talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

52
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,930
actively tries to distance themselves

53
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,850
from the problem itself and i will

54
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,680
probably inevitably do that during the

55
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">course of this video blog in large part</font>

56
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,560
it seems unfamiliar because it is

57
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,909
unfamiliar because we haven't had that

58
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,130
urge to go out and loot things and kind

59
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,020
of bloodlust as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems be</font>

60
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,119
charging the whole event it's really

61
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,380
difficult Hank<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know a really good</font>

62
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,630
post on his tumblr about this perhaps

63
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">being a reaction to some kind of freedom</font>

64
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,890
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold the panopticon has over</font>

65
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,180
our bodies that feeling of always being

66
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,280
watched and suddenly someone decides to

67
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,170
test that and break that and all hell

68
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,759
breaks loose but thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

69
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,049
whole situation also calls to mind

70
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,640
something that Hank spoke about in a

71
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,680
really really early<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brotherhood to point</font>

72
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,140
a video way back in 2007 a hierarchy of

73
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,489
needs I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everyone watching this</font>

74
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,020
video will have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that video will</font>

75
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,459
kind of have some idea of what the

76
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,200
hierarchy of needs is but if you don't

77
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll put a link</font>

78
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,910
in the description bar where you can

79
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,410
find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that you'll really</font>

80
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,910
agree that that's bullshit right we

81
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,560
should stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the rioters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

82
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're like some primitive people to me</font>

83
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,490
it seems like it's the US and then

84
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem again like that whole language</font>

85
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,180
of us and them to me this is

86
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,920
characterized most of all by the world

87
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,470
youth<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used as an accusation every</font>

88
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,350
second of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24-hour news day youths</font>

89
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,570
and yobs and thugs was that

90
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,950
automatically I mean may not

91
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,390
definitionally in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oxford English</font>

92
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,100
Dictionary automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> called mine</font>

93
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,900
teenagers but that have been associated

94
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">with teenagers we make the problem worse</font>

95
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,610
one of the most damaging things about it

96
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,200
is that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who aren't associated</font>

97
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,300
with riots at all teenagers who decided

98
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay at home teenagers who realize</font>

99
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,530
the really damaging long-term effects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

100
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,420
such<font color="#E5E5E5"> action</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also to be frank teenagers</font>

101
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,220
you just don't care feel like a very

102
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,110
significant portion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of teenagers who</font>

103
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,640
have been lumped into that category will

104
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,320
absolutely resent it because I resent it

105
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
especially because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen so many</font>

106
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,560
pictures of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people involved who are</font>

107
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearly not under 20 there are clearly</font>

108
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,670
lots of adults involved in this so can

109
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">we stop saying that it's just used in</font>

110
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,020
jobs and like gangs of thugs yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

111
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,420
there's loads and loads of young people

112
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,880
out there loads of<font color="#CCCCCC"> idiots who it is</font>

113
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,860
burning stuff down so that they can like

114
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,390
get more Playstations and that was the

115
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,010
whole different conversation the cause

116
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,290
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a whole different huge</font>

117
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,260
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's like it's just it's</font>

118
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,120
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge issue with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our society</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

119
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,340
we tell people that they need these

120
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and then we deny them these</font>

121
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,209
things like that is of course that can

122
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,560
happen and then of course that's no

123
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,060
justification for people breaking into

124
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,950
shops and trying to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

125
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole thing assumes</font>

126
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
that all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are doing is the</font>

127
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,650
people who won't wouldn't have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

128
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,720
these items otherwise which isn't the

129
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,700
case either I have a hunch there's quite

130
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,050
a few people were probably looting

131
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,430
things you probably have quite a few

132
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,930
nice things in the home already people

133
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,000
already feel really alienated from

134
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,370
politicians<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everyone who's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

135
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,800
involved in running the country per se

136
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,290
bankers and all of that MPs expenses and

137
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,110
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the just abuse that goes on up there</font>

138
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,300
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge distances huge gulf</font>

139
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,580
already exists language of reporting and

140
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,320
the language<font color="#CCCCCC"> of politicians is not</font>

141
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
helping the situation and it's making

142
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,918
that sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alienation even future and</font>

143
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know at the moment the priority is</font>

144
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting us under control game with</font>

145
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,900
buyers put out making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that bones a</font>

146
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,340
secure making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

secure making

148
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,740
sure that no more damn dogs are injured

149
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,330
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term the way we talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

150
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,680
these kinds of events<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

151
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,900
comparing this whole situation to the

152
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,160
student protests and for people to make

153
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,479
those kinds of associations it's

154
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,490
extremely damaging by also believe that

155
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,500
every action<font color="#E5E5E5"> is political and that this</font>

156
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,100
whole event is in many ways a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

157
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,120
reaction to the politics of the time

158
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,669
