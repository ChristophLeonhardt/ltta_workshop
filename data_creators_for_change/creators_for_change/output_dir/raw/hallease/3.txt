1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,500
- Hi, I'm Hallease Beast.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,003
I'm a digital storyteller
and video producer.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,080
- Hi I'm Mr. Hallease.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,647
I got 99 problems, but
a podcast ain't one.

5
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:12,210
That's was bad.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,423
And I'm a nurse.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,219
Wow, okay.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,753
And this is,

9
00:00:17,753 --> 00:00:20,810
this is the Beast Cast your
favorite aunt and uncle

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,830
talking about all things
married and things

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,330
like such as what's our intro?

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,660
And things like such as.

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,493
- I forget.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,530
- We'll figure it out.

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,839
- Roll intro music.

16
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:36,339
(upbeat electronic music)

17
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:45,780
- Alright so

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,550
today's episode we're
talking about conflict.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,270
- Yes, I think this stems from me

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,300
looking and listening
to some of the podcasts

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,700
and thinking that like
we're not coming at this

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,730
from like a place of expertise

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,180
only experience

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,610
and that we are not the defacto experts.

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,350
So take everything that we
tell you with a grain of salt.

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,530
And also, like any other relationships

27
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,940
we

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,820
have issues.

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,180
We present not even intentionally but

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,340
we present a certain level of relationship

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,460
and interaction between each other,

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,490
but even we

33
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,310
experience conflict.

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,842
- Yeah.

35
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,120
I think something I don't ever want people

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,613
to think is that we've got it figured out.

37
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,640
We're a well oiled.

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,670
We've found a common ground for sure.

39
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,830
But we still definitely have issues.

40
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,910
We don't want you all to ever listen/watch

41
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,370
and think oh they just always
got it together #goals.

42
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,650
And it's like no.

43
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,530
We definitely still have struggles.

44
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,913
For example,

45
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,613
today.

46
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:01,920
And I'll let you actually tell it.

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,030
Cause I'm still working trough how I feel.

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,840
So, yeah.

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,820
- So I was acting in
typical Mr. Hallease fashion

50
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,960
which is a little bit annoying.

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,570
I will admit.

52
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,910
If I was friends with
myself I'd probably only

53
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,600
spend like one day a week

54
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:20,818
with some exposure.

55
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:22,190
- You're so hard on yourself.

56
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,890
- I mean I'm, whatever.

57
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,200
So woke up in the morning.

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
We had discussed whether
or not we were going to get

59
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,663
up early today.

60
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,490
Because if it's later
in the day I get sleepy

61
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,710
and I need more caffeine.

62
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,203
And I'm not as coherent in the podcast.

63
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,233
So we got up relatively
early today actually.

64
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,640
But I went to let the dog out

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,890
and then when I came back

66
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,330
you were on your phone

67
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,720
and I thought you were just on your phone

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,580
but you were looking at the Will Smith

69
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,123
and Jada Pinkett Smith Red Table podcast.

70
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:58,560
- Yes, I was trying to
pull selects from it

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,210
for a podcast episode for us.

72
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,140
I did not realize she was doing that.

73
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,910
Second, I did not realize that the capture

74
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,550
app or software whatever you were using

75
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,893
on your phone picks up
whatever is on the mic.

76
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,290
- Not just whatever is
playing on the phone,

77
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,123
the environment.

78
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:17,080
- Right.

79
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,680
So, and I didn't know that.

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,290
So I came over and just
did like a normal yawn

81
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:27,010
and she didn't snap but she said,

82
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,843
I forget what you even said.

83
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:28,676
- I was like, can you not.

84
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,823
- Yeah, can you not right now.

85
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,640
And then like went back to your phone

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,050
and I was like okay.

87
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,883
I'm just.

88
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,903
First off you do loud
yawns all the time too.

89
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,720
Frequently.

90
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,960
It was like okay.

91
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,070
Not sure how I feel about
that but I feel a certain

92
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,903
type of way.

93
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,163
Whatever we're just.

94
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,670
Got dressed, did all this stuff.

95
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,033
Went to breakfast.

96
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,423
We're not plugging the restaurant.

97
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,256
- No.

98
00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:58,890
- Yeah, sponsor us first.

99
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,360
Mystery restaurant.

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,193
Figure it out.

101
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,840
So we get to the restaurant.

102
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:06,580
And we sit down.

103
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,070
Man I can't even remember the second part

104
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,190
of this but.

105
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,160
- Oh we sit down.

106
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,670
And I was like, oh okay what
episodes are we doing today?

107
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,163
- And then I was just kind of like well,

108
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,399
no you said I guess we're
doing the Jada Pinkett Smith

109
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,429
or whatever Red Table thing.

110
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,890
It's like we should take notes.

111
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,610
And you were getting ready
to take notes on your phone

112
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,700
and I said, oh the time for
taking notes was yesterday

113
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,200
or last night.

114
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,550
Cause I wanted to come home

115
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,010
have a drink,

116
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,653
and then make notes on my computer.

117
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,763
But I got lazy.

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,380
And so I was like oh the
time for making notes

119
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,810
the artistic mindset it's gone.

120
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,310
It's gone for me.

121
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,240
So I don't know if I can do it.

122
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,823
And then your response was.

123
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,640
- Why can't we just take notes now?

124
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,790
While we're waiting for the food.

125
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,863
- But with a tone.

126
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,433
It's like.

127
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,210
It's like one of those tones

128
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,050
that is only audible either to dogs

129
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,210
or to like that's it's
annoying to like teenagers.

130
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,660
Like only teenagers can hear.

131
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,673
You know.

132
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:14,193
Where it's like oh, what?

133
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,517
Why can't we take notes now.

134
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,020
You know.

135
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,040
Even that's a bad like reenactment but.

136
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,720
So I was like okay you're right.

137
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,823
We can take notes.

138
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,780
We started taking notes and some stuff

139
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,240
and I started feeling
a certain type of way

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,450
and then knowing we we're
going to be in front

141
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,253
of the camera making a podcast.

142
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm just gonna admit it.

143
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,730
I cannot hide things

144
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,830
like hide my emotions.

145
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,780
No.

146
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,613
No.

147
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:46,983
They just come tumbling out,
just diarrhea of the mouth.

148
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:52,870
And so I'm not gonna be all
butthurt in front of the camera

149
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,950
leaning back away from the mic

150
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,390
it's like,

151
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,223
yeah.

152
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,930
Yeah.

153
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,870
What does it mean to be in a relationship?

154
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,703
Just having.

155
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,710
Having like an attitude about it.

156
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,300
So I brought it up at breakfast.

157
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,133
- You did.

158
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,800
- And said, I feel like
there is a type of.

159
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,030
- You said, I feel like
there's an abrasion.

160
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,070
- In the relationship.

161
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,660
Not in the relationship but just like

162
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,330
in the reactions that
we're having right now.

163
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,193
- Yeah.

164
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:25,947
- And you said oh really?

165
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:28,160
- And I was like oh really?

166
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,993
- And I said yes.

167
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:30,080
- I don't feel the abrasions.

168
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,530
But if you say there is abrasions

169
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,478
then okay.

170
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,640
- Feel like someone is taking
a little bit of sandpaper

171
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,460
and just going right across the eyelids,

172
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,520
It's not painful but it's
like it's not pleasant.

173
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,353
- Yeah.

174
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,840
- So we talked about that.

175
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,780
- Yes.

176
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
- And we figured out

177
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,570
as I look up on my phone.

178
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,570
Pay no attention to the man

179
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,620
looking at his phone.

180
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:57,610
- We figured out a few things.

181
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,220
- So the first immediate
thing that you mentioned

182
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,790
was that you felt

183
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,560
like you were in work mode.

184
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,590
And so that's another aside.

185
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,550
Because there is Hallease.

186
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,270
There is like beautiful strong willed

187
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,533
even normal Hallease is strong willed.

188
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,020
- Yes.

189
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,253
- Intelligent.

190
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,120
Loving.

191
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,480
Wife, friend, whatever.

192
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,300
Like she's all of these things right?

193
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,770
When she goes on set,

194
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,580
or she knows that she's gonna do something

195
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,810
she is of a single

196
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,810
mind.

197
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,090
She has like laser like
focus and she does not deal

198
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,530
with your garbage.

199
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,270
She does not deal with anybody's garbage.

200
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,030
She is solely focused

201
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,510
again,

202
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,220
on the job and the task at hand.

203
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,810
- Yeah.

204
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,103
Which makes me good at my job but.

205
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,720
- No, that just makes
you good at your job.

206
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
- Yeah.

207
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,900
- Like I've been on set with you

208
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,410
ad you're like, stop messing around

209
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,250
because we need to get the job done.

210
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,083
And it's like oh okay.

211
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,360
And then I get back into

212
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,100
we're not husband and wife right now.

213
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,933
We're just like,

214
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,300
we're doing the thing.

215
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,450
And then we can peel back the layer

216
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,310
and be husband and wife afterwards.

217
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,390
That's what you mentioned.

218
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,530
- I did mention that yeah.

219
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,580
- And I didn't know

220
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,640
that

221
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,360
this whole podcast thing

222
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,510
was like

223
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,190
it had manifested into work.

224
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,790
To me it was more like oh.

225
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,370
We're just shooting this little thing.

226
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,737
It's coming up on your channel.

227
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,640
Excuse me.

228
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,780
And it's going to these
other platforms and stuff,

229
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,663
as a podcast.

230
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,681
But I didn't know it was a thing.

231
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,710
- What did you think we were doing though?

232
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,740
- I just didn't know that it was work.

233
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,473
This is not really work.

234
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:43,337
To me.

235
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:44,170
- Right.

236
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,004
Yeah I guess to you.

237
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,590
For me it's not work.

238
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,540
But it is

239
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,450
and this ties back into I feel like

240
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,570
how I'm perceived or how
being in this industry

241
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,700
is perceived by even those closest to me

242
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,170
where it is like,

243
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,010
oh it just seems like you're
just shooting this shit

244
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,380
and you just kind of.

245
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,530
- Are we cursing in the podcast?

246
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,363
- I don't know.

247
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:05,196
- Maybe we're not.

248
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,040
I don't know.

249
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,830
But it seems like you're
just kind of hanging out

250
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,733
and then you kind of make up a podcast.

251
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,963
And it's like no.

252
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,900
It takes things.

253
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,860
It takes thought.

254
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,120
It takes effort.

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,860
I'm very focused on quality,

256
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,850
always as well.

257
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,563
So we're.

258
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,600
So yeah we're hanging out.

259
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,550
We're shooting.

260
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,140
We're just kind of like,

261
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,923
you know recording conversations
we would have anyway.

262
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,090
But, my name is on it so

263
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,350
there has to be

264
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,183
polished.

265
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:40,510
I don't get the

266
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,940
I don't get the privilege of just

267
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,660
throwing something out there.

268
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,250
- You also mentioned

269
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,280
all the analytics

270
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,700
and the data and the numbers and like

271
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,980
looking at subscribers and
all this other stuff like.

272
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,000
That's adding on to it too.

273
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,860
The pressure of.

274
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,693
- Yeah.

275
00:09:58,693 --> 00:09:59,643
- One ,the quality.

276
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:03,030
But making sure that
we're putting out content

277
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,450
that people are actually gonna digest.

278
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,160
- But then also balancing that too

279
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,270
with a level of authenticity
that I don't want to ever lose

280
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,683
for the sake of numbers.

281
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:13,858
So, you know.

282
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,330
I like doing this because.

283
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,150
I like having these conversations with you

284
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,700
with the podcast because this
is authentic to me of like.

285
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,810
If people want to see you more,

286
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,330
this is the way that I
would want to frame them

287
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,460
to see you.

288
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,160
Because it's a very real version of you

289
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,830
rather than me just like

290
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,650
look at my beige bag.

291
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,400
On the channel and it's like that's not.

292
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,570
- I'm so white skinned too.

293
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,403
- Yeah.

294
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,220
That's not what I'm trying to do.

295
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,230
You know, so.

296
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,760
That's the other thing.

297
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,270
Brief announcement.

298
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,340
Thank you for watching this Beast Cast.

299
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,350
One thing that you can
do that will really help

300
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,470
is like this video,

301
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,360
also leave us a comment letting us know

302
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,630
what you liked about this Beast Cast

303
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,930
what you would like us to change,

304
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,610
if you have any topic ideas

305
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,380
leave them down in the comments below.

306
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,090
And then the other big thing you can do

307
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,630
to help with the Beast
Cast in supporting it is

308
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,273
- Watch the ads.

309
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,124
- Yeah.

310
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,070
- Let the ads play through.

311
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,903
Do not skip.

312
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,736
- Please.

313
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,460
- That really does help.

314
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,960
We know that some of them are very long

315
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,983
and annoying so.

316
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,540
Hang on as long as you can.

317
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,150
We understand if it's just too.

318
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,990
Hit that skip button.

319
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,830
But if you can bear it,

320
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,370
please watch it.

321
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,203
Cause it really does help.

322
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:28,477
Like I've seeing the
analytics and it's helping.

323
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:30,371
It's legitimately helping.

324
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:32,280
- We also know that some of these ads

325
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,500
are like these political ads.

326
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,030
And especially if you're in Texas

327
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,170
and you know what's goin on in Texas.

328
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,310
Be Texas strong.

329
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,313
- Yeah, it's a mess.

330
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:42,910
So, find your center.

331
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,110
And if today ain't the day to watch an ad.

332
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,943
We understand.

333
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,580
But please like the video.

334
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,621
The other thing you can do

335
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,160
is checking us out on Patreon.

336
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,523
Patreon.com/Hallease.

337
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,350
In there it is where we post

338
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,800
all of these Beast Casts as well.

339
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,550
And it directly goes towards
continuing the Beast Cast

340
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,670
and funding this channel.

341
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,356
If the spirit moves you

342
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,380
check that out.

343
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,810
- Yeah.

344
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,260
- Back to the Beast Cast.

345
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,670
- That's a weird aside.

346
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,815
- It is a weird aside.

347
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,690
- We're just a weird aside
to like some of the comments

348
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,420
where people like oh

349
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,040
are we not acknowledging those?

350
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,910
- Oh yeah.

351
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,990
Like some of the comments
we'll get on the videos,

352
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,210
where we're both in them and they're like,

353
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,720
I don't understand why he's with her

354
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,040
cause she's so dark skinned,

355
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,550
it's very like colorism based.

356
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,390
And it's like oh.

357
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,223
- Well, first off.

358
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:32,710
Like I didn't realize that
I come off as so light

359
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,867
in pigmentation on the camera.

360
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:35,700
But it's like.

361
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,070
- It's because you're
in juxtaposition to me.

362
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,903
- It's like.

363
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:39,736
- I'm beautifully melaninated.

364
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:40,737
You know what I'm saying.

365
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:42,330
- And there is nothing
wrong with being white

366
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,791
but it's like I am not white.

367
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,624
I'm dark.

368
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,640
I'm a light mocha.

369
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,163
You're pretty fair love.

370
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,950
Coming from

371
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,850
me.

372
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,280
- I run outside in the sun

373
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,750
shirtless to gain as much,

374
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,530
just drink up as much of the sun as I can.

375
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,435
- And you do.

376
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:05,390
Again, it's the direct contrast.

377
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,793
I mean if you were out
in the world by yourself,

378
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,996
sure.

379
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,090
- It's just weird how like

380
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,860
how much people.

381
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,693
- Fixate on it?

382
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,640
- Well they just fixate on different

383
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,473
like facets of it.

384
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:19,560
It's like oh you're light enough.

385
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,140
- Yeah, a lot of it is
just like self hate.

386
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,420
Cause usually the women that
I see that say those comments

387
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,149
are like oh I can't believe he's with her

388
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,270
and it's like the tone
of it is very much like,

389
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,350
oh yeah it's cause I'm dark.

390
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,260
You know.

391
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,820
For me those comments usually hurt more

392
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,920
than some white person
dropping in and dropping

393
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,820
the n bomb and then peacing out you know.

394
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,200
Because to me,

395
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,070
they don't hurt because they
actually hurt my feelings

396
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,960
they hurt because I know it's coming from

397
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,710
a place of like they
don't love themselves.

398
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,290
Like they've had so much time in people

399
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,878
their cultures surrounding saying.

400
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:55,180
You're not beautiful
because you're darker.

401
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,320
You're not deserving of
a good partner because

402
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,780
you're darker.

403
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,350
That when I see those comments

404
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,870
I can see like dang.

405
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,650
Whether you're light skinned,
dark skinned whatever you are.

406
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,540
They're just projecting that.

407
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,373
- Yeah.

408
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:10,206
- Unto me.

409
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:11,039
Makes me sad.

410
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,970
- You had all that on your mind and then

411
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,400
in addition to that.

412
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,233
- Yes.

413
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:18,290
- There was also this thing
that I innocuously brought up

414
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,951
and didn't know that it
was gonna bother you.

415
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:20,800
- Yeah.

416
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,270
- Which was.

417
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,103
- Yeah.

418
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,750
- This gig that a co-worker had

419
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,220
like tagged me on Facebook,

420
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,570
which I never get on Facebook anyway.

421
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,470
But it was just like a photography gig

422
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,440
for a race that's coming up.

423
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,160
It's the American Heart
Association Heart Walk.

424
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,350
It's nationwide and stuff.

425
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,450
You should support it.

426
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,870
And I said oh okay maybe.

427
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,220
She tagged me because I assumed.

428
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,260
- To go running.

429
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,390
- Cause I already signed up.

430
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,980
- Oh okay.

431
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,320
- Sorry hit the mic.

432
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,550
But to see if you wanted to shoot it.

433
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,430
- Ah yeah.

434
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,890
- And I didn't realize

436
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,430
that that brought.

437
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,330
- That brings it's own level of,

438
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,900
frustration if you will

439
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,020
because.

440
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,500
- And it seemed like
I was projecting stuff

441
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,333
which I wasn't.

442
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,166
- Right.

443
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,520
So in the past

444
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,250
when you've brought up things like that

445
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,050
it was usually because

446
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,629
I think there was just
a lack of understanding

447
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,100
of the work ethic that I was putting in.

448
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
The focus I was putting into

449
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,060
whether it be,

450
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,210
usually just like the
channel specifically.

451
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,230
Because you're not quite seeing,

452
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,150
again, and this is
another thing that people

453
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,260
have talked about like,

454
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,260
oh, well you've got the
support of a spouse so

455
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,990
it's not that hard for
you to succeed at this

456
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,010
YouTube thing because you've got support.

457
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,960
And it's like that's true to a degree.

458
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,330
That is very much true.

459
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,220
But people also have to remember

460
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,260
it's not just my life.

461
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,070
Like if I fail,

462
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,010
it's not just me that's failing.

463
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,210
- And all of this is tying together

464
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,320
with anyway.

465
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,153
- Yeah.

466
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:50,220
So if I fail it's not
just me that's failing.

467
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,743
I'm letting someone else's life down too.

468
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,120
I would have gone freelance

469
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,953
not even freelance.

470
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,520
I would've done YouTube full-time

471
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,240
a lot sooner

472
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,480
if it was just me.

473
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,210
If I knew that I was
only letting myself down

474
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,773
if I didn't make it.

475
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,820
But I waited a lot longer

476
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,360
because I knew it wasn't just my life

477
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,871
I was affecting if I did that.

478
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:12,704
- Right.

479
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,360
- And so, yeah you sending me

480
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,330
hey here is a gig,

481
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,140
it's like, one I understand
where it's coming from.

482
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,250
But at the same time

483
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,250
I know that I can feel that

484
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,440
call it divine if you will

485
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,000
that I need to focus on this.

486
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,883
All the time.

487
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,533
And nothing else.

488
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,380
And I know for other creatives

489
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,760
that are probably watching or listening

490
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,200
it can be very disheartening

491
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:44,440
when your family or your friends

492
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,780
don't quite understand that focus.

493
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,270
And why that focus is necessary.

494
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,660
And they kind of project on to you

495
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,540
this thing of like,

496
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,160
well,

497
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,763
do this safe alternative that
gets you temporary gains.

498
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,070
You know so.

499
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,660
I was all of that was in my mind too

500
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,000
when you sent that.

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,690
- Well to give more concrete context.

502
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,807
- Ah okay.

503
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,409
Yeah I'm speaking very abstractly I guess.

504
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:10,599
- Right.

505
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,399
In the past I was concerned about money

506
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,319
because there is,

507
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,529
if you've been listening
to some of the podcasts

508
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,680
or you know what we've been
going through as far as

509
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,990
financial and housing
and all this other stuff

510
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,680
I just, I get a neurosis
and it's again like a pearl.

511
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,450
My Brian just slowly
starts building and adding

512
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,870
more thoughts to it and like oh my God

513
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,480
what if we did this and this and that

514
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,313
and then yes.

515
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,146
So I just think like,

516
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:37,210
oh my God we need money.

517
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,590
And so I'll suggest oh you know.

518
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,750
Like maybe you could do this

519
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,070
or maybe you could do this

520
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,860
or maybe I can go and earn more money or

521
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,693
something,

522
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,360
So I've mentioned stuff like that

523
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,200
and that was again

524
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,150
a point of contention
between the two of us

525
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,170
a little bit.

526
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,970
Ans I've stopped doing that.

527
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,560
And I am not

528
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,743
or I've at least tried to stop doing it.

529
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:02,518
And so this one thing I just thought oh.

530
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,470
Well they do need pictures
at the Heart Walk.

531
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,920
At this event.

532
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,040
She has a camera.

533
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,290
- And I'm always bringing my camera

534
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,360
with me anywhere anyways.

535
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,193
So it's like.

536
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:13,770
After you explained yourself I was like.

537
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,070
Oh yeah, that does make sense.

538
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,270
I would have taken photos anyway.

539
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,520
- But I didn't understand

540
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,150
that it was gonna have that effect on you.

541
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,983
- Right.

542
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:21,816
Yeah.

543
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,160
- Anyway.

544
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,220
So I had breakfast.

545
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,070
I said oh,

546
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,200
well that makes sense.

547
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
And then I was also thankful
that we were able to

548
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,442
talk about it.

549
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:33,275
- Yeah.

550
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:34,440
- And again, the difference
between the two of us

551
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,130
and you mentioned this at breakfast.

552
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,470
- So something for me

553
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,430
that I'm still working through
and trying to get better

554
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,970
about doing is

555
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,660
I'll let things slide a lot

556
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,193
that I should actually just
bring up right at the time.

557
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,730
So much so that eventually,

558
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,720
like I excuse, I recuse myself

559
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,490
a lot from situations.

560
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,690
Even when we were dating I'm
embarrassed to do this to you,

561
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,250
like we'd get into a bit of a tiff

562
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,720
and I would literally leave the apartment.

563
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,793
And like go get a donut or something.

564
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:05,600
- I remember that

565
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,770
- I would make, what do you call it?

566
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,700
A French exit.

567
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,770
Just leave.

568
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,500
Juts bounce.

569
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,560
Which is not good when
you're trying to communicate

570
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,073
effectively with a partner.

571
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,740
Whereas Mr. Hallease
actually on the other hand

572
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,000
is not like that.

573
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,230
He immediately, when he feels
that there has been a rift

574
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,900
or the shift, a change
in like the equilibrium

575
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,180
of the relationship that is a good one,

576
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,480
he immediately brings it up.

577
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,797
So much so that sometimes it's stuff that,

578
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:36,490
the stuff that you were
bringing up this stuff

579
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,111
and to me I didn't even
think anything of it.

580
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,030
- Right.

581
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,863
- I was just kind of like.

582
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:43,297
I just need you to be quiet
so I can record this thing.

583
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:47,290
Or I just want to take notes
because I want to always

584
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,583
put out the best product I can put out.

585
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:52,330
And thinking oh,

586
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,980
last night was the time to take notes.

587
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,930
And this morning isn't is like,

588
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,930
I mean you're right,

589
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,770
ideally we would do it last night,

590
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,310
but nothing is ideal.

591
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,780
And we're waiting for food so let's like,

592
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,420
do what we can now.

593
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,253
- Right.

594
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:06,086
- You know.

595
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,950
And so I'm just gonna
not bring anything up

596
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,680
until it builds up so
bad that I just blow up

597
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,523
at somebody.

598
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,690
That's how I roll.

599
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,360
Whereas Mr. Hallease just
brings it up immediately.

600
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,260
He squashes it before
it can ever be a thing.

601
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,830
- Well no, so that's not true.

602
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,720
I'll do the same thing
of just blowing stuff off

603
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,310
if it's jut like a little minor annoyance,

604
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,210
but if in my brain if it feels so big

605
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,340
that it comes to the
forefront of my thoughts

606
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,530
and I can't push anything
else in front of it,

607
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,000
and this happens at work.

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,470
like I'll try to do work,

609
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,290
but I keep thinking about that

610
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,670
then it's like you've done before.

611
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,470
There is no point to working.

612
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,395
Like I need to address this.

613
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:47,228
- Yeah.

614
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:49,490
- Otherwise it's gonna take
up the entirety of my day

615
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,374
and I will not be constructive.

616
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:52,277
- Right.

617
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:54,400
But I guess for me the level,

618
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,550
like the way we gauge those perspectives

619
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,440
is very different.

620
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,367
So like I said, I didn't
anything I was doing

621
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,210
was that crazy.

622
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,043
But then he brought it up,

623
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:03,876
so I was like oh.

624
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,900
And we know enough about
each other where it's like

625
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,960
oh you brought it up so
obviously it is something.

626
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,188
- Well I mean it's,

627
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:12,260
if you watch a series,

628
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,350
we watch Bob's Burgers all the time

629
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,853
on Hulu, sponsor us Hulu.

630
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,460
We can spout lines.

631
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,800
We know which episode is which.

632
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,580
So when you see something
or you've read a book enough

633
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,780
then if there is a small change

634
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,120
so let's say like I'm
watching a YouTube video

635
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,320
of Bob's Burgers or something

636
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
and like someone had done an edit

637
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,172
and I know that's off.

638
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,950
You just recognize it.

639
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,710
And it's not to say that we're

640
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,380
like in a rut or anything,

641
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,958
but it's like if I were to know that

642
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,600
there was something wrong with anybody

643
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,433
it would be you.

644
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,050
I don't have that some
emotional intelligence

645
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,883
that you do.

646
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:55,330
But yeah if I should know
that something is wrong

647
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,520
I should know that
something is wrong with you.

648
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,733
- I will notice,

649
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,760
actually this is a prime
example, last night,

650
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,310
last night you were working out

651
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,478
negotiating some stuff,

652
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:07,313
right?

653
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,333
Was it last night?

654
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,166
The night before.

655
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,500
Night before you were working
out and negotiation some stuff

656
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,030
and you brought your laptop into,

657
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,230
here for me to look at
read it and critique right?

658
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,660
And so, I remember as I was critiquing it

659
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,930
I started using language

660
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,650
that I could tell offended
you, a little bit.

661
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,710
Just in the way your tone shifted.

662
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,543
- Hm hm.

663
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:31,920
- And I noticed that

664
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,570
and I just pulled back.

665
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,403
Right?

666
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,790
I said it again but I
tweaked the language.

667
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,890
- Softened it a little bit.

668
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,937
- Softened it a Little bit, yes.

669
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:44,170
- At least, you softened it enough

670
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,940
but again it's like,

671
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,188
I know that you're not
saying it to hurt me.

672
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:50,021
- Right.

673
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,150
like the two things that
you did this morning

674
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,914
I know that you're not doing them

675
00:22:54,914 --> 00:22:56,140
with malicious intent.

676
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,160
- Yeah, I'm not trying to
make you feel terrible.

677
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,993
- Right.

678
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:01,140
So I just know that there
must be something else

679
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,130
that's working behind that.

680
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,960
So with the comments that you made with me

681
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,090
negotiation stuff,

682
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,880
I knew you were trying to make a point

683
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,880
and so I was trying to see it
from a different perspective

684
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,800
and then once I re-read it

685
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,410
having heard what you said

686
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,170
I was like oh yeah that's.

687
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,330
We can just delete this whole thing.

688
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,163
- Right.

689
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:20,580
Yeah, but it's like, it takes

690
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,460
it takes a certain level of like

691
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,534
almost I guess trust in the other person.

692
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:27,441
- Yeah.

693
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:28,950
- Cause I still like,

694
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,850
now that, once you made me sit

695
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,150
there and think about it

696
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,900
at breakfast I was like yeah I guess,

697
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,320
what's bothering me is this.

698
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,130
Or this is just a frame
of mind that I get in

699
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,480
when this is happening.

700
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,700
Or when someone mentions this.

701
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,480
And then I project a frustration

702
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,583
on to you

703
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,220
sorry about that.

704
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,310
- People's emotions are like an egg right?

705
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,600
So like in a marriage

706
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,320
you have an egg with each
other's like emotions.

707
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,760
Like essentially like,

708
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,593
so it's very,

709
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:01,590
like an egg is strong right?

710
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,423
- Ish.

711
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:04,780
- Well it can take some abuse,

712
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,246
but

713
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:08,190
knowing

714
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,790
what to do in certain situations.

715
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,710
If I were to grab the egg and pick it up

716
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,930
and hold it,

717
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,020
I'm using just enough force
to move the egg around

718
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,140
and get it to where I want it to be

719
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,023
to manipulate it.

720
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,540
But if I were to grab it and
throw it against the wall

721
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,373
- Right.

722
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:28,351
- Or like grab it and crush it.

723
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:29,184
- Yeah.

724
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,930
- It's like, you can

725
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,310
you just need to know

726
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,930
what to do with your partner
in certain situations.

727
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,420
And that takes time.

728
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,440
- You also, you have to
grant yourself some patience.

729
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,510
Like grant yourself
some grace and patience.

730
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,610
And then also grant your partner that too.

731
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:47,720
So, something I appreciate about you

732
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,970
is that now I've gotten to the point

733
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,070
where when you do pull me aside,

734
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,320
and it's like something is wrong,

735
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,870
even if I don't think something is

736
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,070
I hear you out because

737
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,470
it's more about

738
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,600
understanding my own

739
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,740
ish if you will.

740
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,350
And realizing that oh he
can see something in me

741
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,880
that I'm not seeing,

742
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,690
that's problematic.

743
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,030
And should be addressed.

744
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,820
Because again it's kind of
like what we talked about

745
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,200
in the last episode

746
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:15,890
with like you going home to your parents

747
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,900
and then me saying no you
need to deal with this now.

748
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,460
Cause then you come home

749
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,340
cause we come back and what you bring back

750
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,740
into the relationship

751
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,016
is toxic.

752
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:24,970
Right.

753
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,490
And I don't want to be around it.

754
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,100
So for you, that's kind of like

755
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,450
what you were doing this morning.

756
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,470
I don't know what's going on with you

757
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,303
but something is happening

758
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,300
and you're being toxic right now.

759
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,470
- But I also know that the podcast.

760
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,920
So you have made it
clear that the podcasts

761
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,386
were important to you.

762
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:40,219
- Yeah.

763
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,370
- Right, like they don't
directly influence me

764
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,460
but I know the podcast
are important to you.

765
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,140
And so if I were to carry this

766
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,470
this burden, this emotional like baggage

767
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,560
all throughout the podcast,

768
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,116
so it's going to affect the podcast one.

769
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:53,949
- Right.

770
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:55,328
- Secondly, it's going to
put me in a really bad mood.

771
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:56,270
- Yeah.

772
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,103
- And thirdly like,

773
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:58,360
the whole day is gonna be gone.

774
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,193
- Yeah.

775
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,630
- Concerning A and B or one and two.

776
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,410
- Yeah, yeah.

777
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,060
- So I just knew that it
just needed to be addressed,

778
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:10,880
so I can get in a better mindset.

779
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,500
And be better for these podcasts.

780
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,333
- That's true.

781
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,180
Maybe it comes down to

782
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,170
there is a certain
level of not selfishness

783
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,400
but like set yourself up to succeed.

784
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,060
If you know you're gonna
be a certain type of way

785
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,790
with your partner set it
up so you're not a certain

786
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,640
type of way with your partner.

787
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,120
You know, take what you need.

788
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,933
And I think it gets easier to come at.

789
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:33,950
I gets easier to come at
into situations of conflict

790
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,220
from a loving place.

791
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,400
- Right.

792
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,520
- As you spend more time together.

793
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,684
- That's this episode I guess.

794
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,733
- We are not perfect.

795
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:42,566
- We are not perfect.

796
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:43,863
- Stuff happens.

797
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:44,696
- Whoo.

798
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:46,610
We'd be working through
conflicts just like

799
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,610
the rest of y'all.

800
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,260
- Yeah, I mean.

801
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,210
We're not trying to be butterfly farts

802
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,360
and unicorns giggles.

803
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,530
- Do butterflies fart?

804
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,480
- I think it's unicorn
farts and butterfly giggles

805
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,530
is what I've said, but anyway.

806
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,680
- Do butterflies giggle or fart?

807
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,610
I'll Google that later.

808
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,443
- They might.

809
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:05,900
Anyway, we're not trying to present

810
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,070
like the Instagram

811
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,380
life right?

812
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,360
Where you're curating every little thing.

813
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,193
- No we ain't gonna do that.

814
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:13,230
- That you put in front of the camera

815
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,380
or the mic or whatever.

816
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:17,737
- That ain't what this is.

817
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,250
- But we do love each other.

818
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,083
- We do.

819
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:20,916
- Sometimes.

820
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,860
- I like looking in the left direction.

821
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,620
Looking at you to the right
of me was just kind of weird.

822
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,453
- Really?

823
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,420
- So this should be the way we're set up.

824
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,440
- And also I feel more comfortable.

825
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,662
- Okay.

826
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:33,920
- If this is your strong side.

827
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,930
- This our cage.

828
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,980
- Ahh.

829
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,920
- I am comfortable in the cage.

830
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,973
This is my den.

831
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,363
- Alright.

832
00:27:41,363 --> 00:00:00,000
- That's how you train a dog.
