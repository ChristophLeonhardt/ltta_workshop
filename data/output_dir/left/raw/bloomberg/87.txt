1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,502
(moody music)

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:06,075
This is Rich Chigga.

3
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:08,776
He's a Chinese rapper by way of Indonesia,

4
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:11,943
and he's very popular on the internet.

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,088
This is Joji.

6
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,448
He's a Japanese-Australian singer

7
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:21,031
and he's also very
popular on the internet.

8
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:25,906
Plus, Joji invented the Harlem Shake meme.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,937
Let me say that again.

10
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:31,734
This guy, Joji, in the blood bathtub,

11
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,317
invented the Harlem Shake meme.

12
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:37,857
But we'll come back to that.

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,511
So, Rich and Joji are
both signed to 88rising,

14
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,865
an entertainment company hoping to build

15
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,876
a lasting global brand that will outlive

16
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:51,082
singular moments of virality.

17
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,239
They primarily create content

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,160
combining Asian culture and hip-hop,

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,890
a formula that apparently pleases
the internet gods greatly.

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,585
They've only been around for 18 months,

21
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:07,679
but they're already putting
up major label numbers.

22
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:09,347
I think that we have an unprecedented

23
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:10,474
collective of talent.

24
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:13,015
A group of predominantly Asian artists,

25
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:15,532
you know, really like
making waves globally,

26
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:19,069
which from an independent
point of view as well.

27
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:21,610
88's founder, Sean Miyashiro,

28
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,299
cut his teeth launching

29
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,549
Vice's electronic music channel, Thump.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,094
But quickly, Sean became
interested in life

31
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,677
beyond dance music.

32
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:39,283
I knew that, after launching
a whole content platform,

33
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:41,067
that I have kind of the ability

34
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,915
and the know-how to do it again,

35
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,721
but for what was the question.

36
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,677
So Sean moved to the Bronx to start over

37
00:01:46,677 --> 00:01:48,655
and figure it out.

38
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:50,353
He couldn't afford an office space,

39
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:51,987
so he worked out of his car

40
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,070
at the top of a grimy parking garage.

41
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,808
Everything kinda started here.

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,731
If you look around,
this is my environment,

43
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,064
this is my serenity, really.

44
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,081
88rising was built here.

45
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,836
Built on the grounds
of LA Fitness residence

46
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,709
in a parking garage.

47
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,652
I was living in the
Bronx and I'm just like,

48
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:24,015
damn, where the hell do I go?

49
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:26,107
So I just come up here
and I like, you know,

50
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:29,757
I just kind of figure
things out every single day,

51
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,497
being like, okay, what
the hell is this thing?

52
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,641
(laughs)

53
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,894
Coming here was kind of like

54
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:39,189
my own kind of private office basically.

55
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:41,581
Like, to be honest, I would
even go to the bathroom here.

56
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,472
I would take pisses here,
you know what I mean?

57
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:47,639
Like, you know, it's just too
far to go back down there.

58
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:51,911
When I need wi-fi, I'd
spend a good part of the day

59
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,328
at Dunkin Donuts.

60
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:56,770
Hi, how are you?

61
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,353
Can I get a chicken snack wrap?

62
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,649
Before 88rising officially launched,

63
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,518
Sean caught a surprise break

64
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,436
in the form of a Twitter friendship

65
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:10,920
with a funny 16-year-old kid
from Indonesia named Brian,

66
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,184
who taught himself English by watching

67
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:17,131
Rubik's Cube tutorial videos on YouTube.

68
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,600
Seriously, that's true.

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,243
I thought his Twitter was genius,

70
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,703
from the future, just crazy.

71
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,188
And like, just the shit
that he was saying,

72
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,762
like the memes he was making.

73
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:29,310
But I didn't know that he
rapped or anything like that.

74
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,261
I really didn't, and he
came up with Dat $tick

75
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,309
like two weeks later.

76
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,139
♪ 12 in the morning, pop
shells for a living ♪

77
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,764
♪ And berry gon' smell
blood trail every minute ♪

78
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:40,276
Dat $tick was Brian's first ever attempt

79
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:44,678
at making a rap song, and
it immediately went viral.

80
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:45,735
Everything was great about it,

81
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:47,331
but the one thing that I noticed

82
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:49,222
is the song was hard as hell.

83
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:51,026
Just like everything about it, man.

84
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:53,734
Just like, it was menacing, bro.

85
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,142
Soon after the video dropped,

86
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,392
Brian signed with 88rising.

87
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:00,731
I'll FaceTime with Rich.

88
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,919
Sorry for calling you Rich
Chigga on my phone, Rich.

89
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,284
He gets, I mean Brian, he
gets like super pissed off

90
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:08,031
that he's saved in my
phone as Rich Chigga.

91
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:10,837
He's like, "Dude am I not a human to you?"

92
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:12,485
What's good, bro?

93
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,385
What's good, broda?

94
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:14,668
How you doing?

95
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,950
Doing great, I did the sound check.

96
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,209
How was it?

97
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,515
It was tight.

98
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:20,348
♪ Holdin' steel glocks ♪

99
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:22,095
♪ But you been a bitch,
suck a thick cock ♪

100
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,310
So, Brian could definitely rap,

101
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,300
but some viewers
understandably took offense

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,333
at a Chinese kid satirizing rap cliches

103
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,166
and calling himself "Rich Chigga."

104
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:40,792
But if a group of well-known
rappers saw the video

105
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,925
and genuinely liked it,

106
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:45,239
that could at least help validate Brian

107
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:47,406
as a legit hip-hop artist.

108
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:51,798
Plus, it could be really funny.

109
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:53,140
It was just kind of an idea that kind of

110
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,169
I just had on the spot.

111
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,767
Everything that rappers
say is better and funnier

112
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:57,808
and smarter, and wittier.

113
00:04:57,808 --> 00:04:59,489
You know, it's just more entertaining.

114
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:01,848
We just edit it as tight
as possible, put it up,

115
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,598
and it really worked.

116
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,502
(shouting)

117
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:11,622
Yo, this nigga got a
pouch on, a Reebok pouch.

118
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:14,164
This is the hardest nigga of all time.

119
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,835
He said when you come
for a chigga like me.

120
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:17,921
That was dope.

121
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:20,152
This is lit and I think
people will take is as a...

122
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,743
People will take is as a joke at first,

123
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:22,867
but it's like,

124
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:25,606
if he ran with that and kept
doing more videos like that,

125
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:26,439
shit's lit.

126
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,211
You know, I had never
been to America before

127
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,234
and all of a sudden it's like I see like

128
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:33,313
all the rappers that I listen
to reacting to my stuff

129
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:34,709
and I was like, 'What?

130
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,647
How did this happen?'

131
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:38,804
The reaction video also went viral

132
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:40,838
and even led to a remix of Dat $tick

133
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:43,369
featuring Wu-Tang's Ghostface.

134
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:45,061
I'll get on that track.

135
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,964
You know what I'm saying, yeah.

136
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:48,008
Really, on the remix?

137
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,765
Yeah, yeah, oh, you know him?

138
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:53,754
And, yeah, the remix went viral too.

139
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,528
Brian has since acknowledged
the misstep in his name

140
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,038
and claims he made changes,

141
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:00,571
but for the time being,

142
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:03,137
he's still Rich Chigga to his fans,

143
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:05,347
an ever-growing global audience

144
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,353
hungry for more releases

145
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:11,020
from emerging talents
from around the world.

146
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,765
I didn't know that it was gonna

147
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,888
be this impactful and
this important to people

148
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:19,358
and I'm very thankful
and blessed that it has,

149
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:21,724
and every day now that I wake up

150
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:25,891
it's like, you know, just
a new mission every day.

151
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,604
A major part of that mission

152
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:29,771
involves Joji.

153
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:33,411
Remember the bloody bath guy?

154
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,304
He's a former YouTube personality

155
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:37,902
in the middle of a career transition.

156
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:40,682
The sound of this song, Will He,

157
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:44,765
it's like a trap song that
you can slow dance to.

158
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,588
Awkward prom shit.

159
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,338
You know what I mean?

160
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:55,554
I used to do crazy,
episodic internet videos.

161
00:06:57,347 --> 00:06:59,664
It was going well and one day

162
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:03,290
it was me and a few
friends just in a room.

163
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,706
We were casually chilling

164
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:06,437
and then someone plays the song

165
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:08,809
and it's brand new at the time.

166
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,761
I happened to have a lot
of costumes laying around,

167
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:11,735
so I told the other guys,

168
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,112
I was like, get in these costumes

169
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:14,189
and let's just dance to it.

170
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:15,188
Like who cares?

171
00:07:15,188 --> 00:07:19,355
We were like, okay, let's
just go crazy at the drop.

172
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,975
So that video goes up,

173
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,916
I go to sleep

174
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,810
and the next morning
everyone was doing it.

175
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,310
Like next morning.

176
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:32,128
("Harlem Shake")

177
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,145
That taught me a lot about the internet.

178
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:40,968
How people wanna just
be a part of something.

179
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,175
And from that point on

180
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,683
something changed

181
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:46,301
and I was a little better at understanding

182
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:49,127
demographics and people
and what they want to see

183
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,377
and what they want to hear.

184
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,754
I was friends with a couple other artists

185
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,172
who were affiliated with 88

186
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:03,355
and then I also started to realize that 88

187
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:07,522
is the bridge between Western
and Asian entertainment

188
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:12,424
and I really wanted to be a part of that.

189
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:16,232
Joji just released the In Tongues EP,

190
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:20,099
his first project as a serious artist.

191
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,260
Joji's In Tongues record

192
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,914
came out a couple weeks ago.

193
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:25,886
It's number two in the
world on the R&B chart,

194
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,939
which is crazy for independent release

195
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,269
and he's like a brand new artist.

196
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:32,212
And the success is even more impressive

197
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,345
knowing he went from
creating something like this

198
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:36,493
It's just Taco Bell,

199
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,355
what could possibly go wrong?

200
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:39,907
(screams)

201
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:42,214
To creating something like this.

202
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:45,797
The newest music video
for his song Demons.

203
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:51,283
♪ The demons told me everything ♪

204
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:55,606

205
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:59,773
♪ This is not a threat, I promise ♪

206
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:06,415
Tonight Rich Chigga has a show

207
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,512
in New York City.

208
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:10,875
Tickets sold out in an hour.

209
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,549
I came here, I'm first on line,

210
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:13,957
I came here at one.

211
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,819
I was the third person in line.

212
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:16,977
So, why'd you get here so early?

213
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:18,658
Cause I wanna see Rich Chigga.

214
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,594
(yelling)

215
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:20,834
I wanna touch him.

216
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,774
(laughter)

217
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:24,241
What do you guys think of Joji?

218
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,876
He's hot, bro.
Oh my God.

219
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,700
That's my dad, son.

220
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,396
That's my dad, son.

221
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,388
You guys copped the new EP?

222
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,221
Yeah.

223
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,495
I woke up at six in the morning

224
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:35,190
just to cop that shit

225
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,739
and then I listened to it

226
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:39,989
and that shit started made me cry, fam.

227
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:44,313
This is actually kind of exciting.

228
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:45,380
Every time...

229
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,079
This never gets old, like,

230
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,810
you live online in social media,

231
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,150
but there's nothing like this.

232
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,844
Being with the people.

233
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:54,094
(cheering)

234
00:09:58,076 --> 00:09:59,723
Ten, nine,

235
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,806
Eight, seven, six, five,

236
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,545
four, three, two, one.

237
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,594
(screaming)

238
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,926
♪ Back on my bullshit,
man you can't believe it ♪

239
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:24,093
♪ Who the fuck just said I should quit ♪

240
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:26,244
More often that not

241
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:29,082
viral success happens by accident.

242
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:30,805
And then after an appearance on Ellen

243
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:31,953
or Jimmy Kimmel

244
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:35,432
the creator's star power fizzles out.

245
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:37,246
But 88rising has figured out

246
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:40,833
how to turn potential gimmicks into brands

247
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,823
with an actual following

248
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:45,105
that keeps coming back for the next thing.

249
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,022
Oh, shit.

250
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,541
So keep an eye out for 88's next move.

251
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,807
More than likely,

252
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,946
it won't be covered on network television

253
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:59,162
or terrestrial radio.

254
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,772
Although, as they've already proven,

255
00:11:01,772 --> 00:00:00,000
nowadays that really doesn't matter.
