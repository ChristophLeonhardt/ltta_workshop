HAPPENS OVERNIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CHECK OUT THE HEADLINE FROM
EARLIER TODAY, SENATOR LINDSEY
GRAHAM IS ON THE WARPATH TO GET
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED.
NOW THAT WE HAVE FIVE REPORTED
ALLEGATIONS OF VARYING DEGREES
OF CREDIBILITY AT THIS TIME,
LET'S FIND OUT WHERE
SENATOR GRAHAM STANDS.
A KEY VOTE ON THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.
THEY MAY EXERCISE THAT EXERCISE
THAT AS SOON AS FRIDAY.
FIRST FOR QUESTIONS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU FOR A PREVIEW.
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO WITH
YOUR TIME WITH THE DOCTOR
CHRISITINE BLASEY FORD, THE
ACCUSER?
>> WE HAVE A LADY WHO IS A
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR WHO WILL
ASK QUESTIONS OF DR. FORD AND I
MAY ASK SOME QUESTIONS OF JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
WE'LL SEE.
>> Shannon: WHAT DO YOU SAY --
I BELIEVED IT WAS SENATOR COONS,
DEMOCRAT, WHO SAID THAT YOU ALL
ARE TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND THIS
PROSECUTOR AND DOCK YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY TO ASK QUESTIONS.
>> NUMBER ONE, SENATOR COONS IS
A GOOD FRIEND BUT HE ALSO SAID
THAT BURDEN WAS ON KAVANAUGH TO
PROVE THAT HE WASN'T AT A PARTY
35 YEARS AGO.
NOBODY WILL TELL HIM THE DATE OF
THE PARTY OR THE LOCATION OF THE
PARTY.
JOE BIDEN FROM DELAWARE HAD THE
RIGHT APPROACH.
EVERYBODY IS PRESUMED INNOCENT
WHEN THEY ACCUSE THE MIC ARE
ACCUSED OF RAPE ARE
SEXUAL ASSAULT EXCEPT FOR
KAVANAUGH.
I WILL TELL SENATOR COONS THAT
THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING
THING I HAVE SEEN IN OVER 20
YEARS IN POLITICS.
I VOTED FOR SO TO MY LAWYER
AND -- SONIA SOTOMAYOR AND
ELENA KAGAN.
I'M MORE COMMITTED TO VOTING FOR
KAVANAUGH THAN EVER.
THESE ALLEGATIONS TO ME JUST ARE
FALLING APART AND I'LL BE GLAD
TO GO THROUGH ALL FIVE OF THEM.
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE FIFTH ONE.
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE CHAIN
OF COMMAND OF REPORTING THIS.
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE, DEMOCRAT OF
THE COMMITTEE, CAN BE WITH THIS
ALLEGATION.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> SENATOR WHITEHOUSE GIVE HIM A
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO IS THAT A
CONSTITUENT FROM RHODE ISLAND
TOLD HIM ABOUT AN INCIDENT BACK
IN THE '80s WERE KAVANAUGH AND
MARK JUDGE SUPPOSEDLY TOOK A
YOUNG WOMAN OUT ON A BOAT AND
MISTREATED HER AND THIS WOMAN
TOLD HIM ABOUT IT.
HE WENT TO THE BOAT AND BEAT
THEM BOTH UP.
I SAID, I'LL MAKE SURE THE FBI
TAKES IT SERIOUSLY.
HE DID IT THE RIGHT WAY, HE CAME
TO ME, WE WENT TO THE FBI, IT'S
FALLING APART.
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE TO THE RIGHT
THING.
YOU NEED TO RUN THESE THINGS
DOWN.
NUMBER FOUR, THE ALLEGATION IS
THAT AN ANONYMOUS PERSON WROTE A
LETTER TO CORY GARDNER --
>> Shannon: WE HAVE A LETTER,
WE CAN PUT UP AND SEE HOW THIS
REPORT CAME IN.
SENATOR CORY GARDNER, A
REPUBLICAN HEAD OF COLORADO, NO
>> WE KNOW BECAUSE OF    IT BECU
>> WE KNOW BECAUSE OF    IT BECE
>> WE KNOW BECAUSE OF    IT BECO
RETURN ADDRESS, --
>> WE KNOW BECAUSE OF    IT BECF
NBC.
WE DISTRUST YOU BECAUSE OF
THINGS LIKE THIS.
YOU WOULD NEVER PRINT AN
ANONYMOUS LETTER ACCUSING A
LIBERAL NOMINEE OF WRONGDOING.
THERE IS NO JOURNALISTIC
INTEGRITY LEFT WHEN IT COMES TO
TRUMP AND NOMINEES.
THE IDEA OF AN A REPORT ON AN
ANONYMOUS ACCUSATION AND GIVING
IT CREDIBILITY SAYS ALL YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT WHERE MEDIA IS
WHEN IT COMES TO KAVANAUGH AND
TRUMP.
>> Shannon: YOU ARE A
PROSECUTOR FOR MANY YEARS.
HOW DO YOU TRAVERSE THIS?
ALREADY GO THROUGH IT?
A SITUATION WHERE WE WILL HEAR
FROM DR. FORD
WHAT I THINK IS EVERY GOOD GOOD
FOR EVERYBODY TO ASSESS HER
CREDIBILITY, TO ASSESS THE
ALLEGATIONS.
WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE
ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND TIPS ARE
CALLED A VENTRICLE AGAIN WITH NO
NAMES ATTACHED?
HOW DOES THE JUDGE DEFEND
HIMSELF?
>> NUMBER ONE, I WILL LOOK AT
THIS FROM THE JUDGE'S POINT OF
VIEW.
I USED TO BE A JOKE, BY THE WAY.
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER GOES NOWHERE
BECAUSE IT IT'S ANONYMOUS.
HOW DO YOU DEFEND YOURSELF?
IT'S ABOUT NBC, NOT JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
THE THIRD ACCUSATION, I AM
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN HE
WAS A SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR IN
HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL,
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH RAN A
GANG-RAPE RING AROUND
WASHINGTON, D.C., DRUG WOMEN
ROUTINELY, AND WAS INVOLVED IN
GANG-RAPES AND THE PERSON
ACCUSING HIM OF THIS WENT TO TEN
DIFFERENT PARTIES --
>> Shannon: AT LEAST.
>> NEVER TOLD ANYONE ABOUT IT,
NEVER WORN HER FRIENDS, CALL THE
COPS, IT COMES FROM THE AVENATTI
WORLD, IT MAKES $0.00.
I DON'T BELIEVE A REASONABLE
PERSON WOULD KEEP GOING TO
PARTIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE
DRUGGED AND RAPE RAPED.
I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED TO
MISS FORD BUT SHE CANNOT TELL US
WHERE AND WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW MS. FORD
AND ELLA PEOPLE NAMED HAVING
BEEN AT THIS UNKNOWN LOCATION
SAY IT DID NOT HAPPEN.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
YOU COULDN'T GET A WARRANT IN A
CRIMINAL SETTING, PROBABLE CAUSE
REQUIRES YOU TO DETERMINE THE
LOCATION AND TIME AND HAVE SOME
CORROBORATION.
THERE IS FIVE ALLEGATIONS,
VARYING DEGREES OF RELIABILITY,
ALL OF THEM -- HERE IS THE ONLY
THING I KNOW THAT'S CONSISTENT.
WHEN IT COMES TO JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, THERE ARE NO RULES OR
BOUNDARIES.
IF THE LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO
DESTROY THIS GUY AND TO MY
CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS, WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN?
DO YOU NOT SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING
HERE?
YOU CANNOT FIGURE THIS OUT?
DO YOU REALLY THINK BRETT
KAVANAUGH IS A GANG RAPIST WHEN
HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND NOBODY
KNOWS ABOUT IT UNTIL 2018?
>> Shannon: THE FBI DIDN'T DO
A VERY GOOD JOB, IF THEY MUST
ALL OF HIS COMMAND'S BEEN OUT
THERE FOR 30 YEARS.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
YOU MENTIONED MICHAEL AVENATTI.
MICHAEL AVENATTI SAYS, WHY ARE
DONALD TRUMP, CHUCK GRASSLEY,
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, AND
LINDSEY GRAHAM AFRAID TO GET THE
FBI INVOLVED AND CALL MARK JUDGE
TO TESTIFY?
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HIDE THE
TRUTH FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND THEY KNOW KAVANAUGH IS
GUILTY."
WHY NOT PERSUADE THE WHITE HOUSE
TO ASK THE FBI INVESTIGATION,
CLEAR HIM COMICALLY HERS NAME,
AND THEN HE CAN GET ONTO THE
BENCH?
>> IF YOU REALLY WANTED AN FBI
INVESTIGATION, THIS MAN IS
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS A
DEMOCRAT, HE HAD THE ALLEGATION
BY MY FORD IN JULY.
SHE HIRED A LAWYER, SHE TOOK A
POLYGRAPH, SHE TALKED WITH
"THE WASHINGTON POST," SHE LIED
TO.
YOU HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO BRING
MS. FORD, WHY DID YOU HIDE IT
FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
WHY DID YOU NOT TELL US ABOUT IT
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,
LIKE SENATOR WHITEHOUSE?
THIS IS A COORDINATED EFFORT AT
THE LAST MINUTE TO STOP THE
NOMINATION AND THEY SAY OPENLY,
THE GOAL IS TO KEEP HIM OFF THE
COURT, GET THE SENATE BACK IN
2018, AND DENY PRESIDENT TRUMP A
SECOND NOMINATION.
I VOTED FOR SONIA SOTOMAYOR AND
ELENA KAGAN BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THEY WERE QUALIFIED.
WHEN I SEE HERE IS A COORDINATED
EFFORT TO DESTROY A GOOD MAN'S
LIFE BY ALLEGATIONS THAT DO NOT
HOLD WATER, THAT YOU COULD NOT
GET A WARRANT FOR, AND I AM
FIGHTING BACK.
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF
WE ABANDON JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I
HOPE PEOPLE ABANDON US BECAUSE
WE WOULD DESERVE IT.
>> Shannon: A LOT OF MY
TWITTER FOLLOWERS SAY THAT IS
HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT.
>> THEY SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY.
>> Shannon: I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RESIST YOUR
