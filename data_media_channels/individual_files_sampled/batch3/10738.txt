russia's Foreign Minister says Moscow has solid evidence that the alleged chemical attack in duma in Syria was staged all those yeasts we have undeniable evidence that this was yet another staged attack that involved intelligence agencies of one of the countries that is rushing to spearhead a Rousseff public campaign our senior correspondent maracas James with me he's across all the developments on this so Sergei Lavrov says the attack was staged the solid proof that pretty much 100% goes against what you'll read in here everywhere else well it was let's remember when this happened this chemical attack allegedly happened just as the rebels in duma in eastern goethe had all but surrendered they were working on technicalities negotiating with the syrian government and how to evacuate and suddenly you have this this huge chemical attack it spread the first information appeared on social media no surprise there and twitter on facebook and then it spread like wildfire but my colleague kendall a nyan and i have learned today that the u.s. now has blood and urine samples from some of the victims of this this attack in syria last weekend and that those samples according to US officials tested positive for chemicals the sources for all of this are the usuals the white helmets which Syrian rebels and Islamists personal rescue service there's also though the Syrian American Medical Society not a lot has been said about them in the media but these two are the biggest sources on this on this chemical attack the Syrian American Medical Society along with the white helmets were cited by the Washington Post New York Times CNN every virtually every Western media outlets reporting on this on this alleged chemical attack but with regards to what happened in in Duma it was the Syrian Sam's the Syrian American Medical Society that initially claimed that they had treated 500 people with with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent some of these groups are gonna be more familiar than others what is this organization exactly well it is it is an organization that is funded by the United States it in 2015 for example it had a budget of around 700 thousand in 2000 sorry in 2013 they had a budget of 700,000 2015 they had a budget of 6 million you know almost a tenfold a tenfold increase most of that money 5.8 million came from US aid which is an organization that is closely tied to the State Department which is banned in multiple countries because of interference and in you know domestic politics because of what is seen as its as its drive for regime change and it even has an office of transition initiatives which is you know exactly what is what is being called this this regime change office nevertheless there the executive director and the director of operations of the Syrian American Medical Association are former US aid staffers and it was them that provided one year ago the OPCW organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons with alleged samples from conchae who where there was an alleged again chemical attack and after which Donald Trump said 57 cruise missiles into Syria that was a violation of the opcw's protocols because the OPCW has very strict rules about accepting samples unless they can verify that a sample came from this place or they can verify the chain of custody so them to make sure that you know nobody could have could have added anything to a sample they cannot take samples in this case they did what about groups that we'd regard as being far more impartial the World Health Organization's talked about this well we've we've reached out to the World Health Organization and they have refused to comment we've written to them twice called them and they said that you know they haven't said anything but if you take if you take their only statement has been that they've heard reports of five hundred people being treated well it seems like that report again traces back to the syrian syrian american medical society we definitely have enough proof but now we just have to be thoughtful in our action the national security team is trying to give him as many options as we can and we'll be thoughtful about it and see what happens again it'll be interesting to see what comes next whether the sam syrian-american Medical Society has given the west enough evidence to to strike at Syria all weather cooler heads will prevail yeah it's the next thing we'll learn about is when the OPCW starts its work tomorrow for now though when I got here thanks very much for that
