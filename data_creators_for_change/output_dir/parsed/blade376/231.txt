for the past month I have tried so hard
to produce a video and portray my
thoughts but inspiration has been
non-existent I've been unable to create
anything of any sort I have so many
ideas but nothing seems to come out
right I know I've been a mess but trust
me I'll eventually be alright I want you
to understand that if I could I
definitely would per regular videos but
right now they've turned out naked each
day I've got my camera and I try and
retry
but right now I feel so frustrated and I
am left to say so I leave you with my
usual goodbye
adios to the next time
