the future of conservatism depends on reconciliation beginning November 9th with Donald Trump flailing in the polls just under two weeks from the presidential election open conflict has broken out between many of the Republicans voting for Trump and those who see him as a moral and political bridge too far for conservatives in the Republican Party for most people that conflict is not based on disagreements about principle most never Trump errs despise Hillary Clinton and will not vote for her most never Trump errs even feel significant sympathy for the vote for Trump to stop Hillary argument we believe that Trump fails to meet the most basic standard of morality and conservatism and supporting him damages Republicans politically now and in the future so we're not gonna vote for either candidate by contrast most Trump voters despise Hillary Clinton and will vote against her most front boaters are voting for Trump is the lesser of two evils not because they support his agenda on trade or trust him as a thoughtful foreign policy stage most Trump voters are not Laura Ingraham or Bill Mitchell or Sean Hannity that's been true since May most from voters will vote for Trump because they believe the overriding priority is to stop Hillary from entering the White House and to that end they're willing to overlook Trump's myriad flaws so why are the two sides of this debate at each other's throats maintenance because they've been projecting bad motives on to the other side on the one hand some never Trump errs have accused a trump voters of being high-handed have sneering at them the most vocal Trump supporters have spent nearly the entirety of the general election cycle focused not on helping Trump win but on blaming never Trump errs if he loses they stated first never Trump errs were unimportant to the debate because there's so few and far between then they stated never Trump errs were the only thing standing between Trump in the White House they've argued that all never Trump errs secretly want Hillary Clinton to be President they can't wait for a Hillary presidency absurd or they don't care about her corruption idiotic or were in the pay of nefarious forces ridiculous the only people literally the only people in this election cycle who have benefited monetarily are those who have boosted their careers by kissing Trump's ass these vocal Trump supporters have engaged in the most crafts moral preening those who disagree about Trump are pure evil saboteurs sellouts now some never Trump errs have made the mistake of attributing the rhetoric and feelings of the people who make these yucky arguments the ardent base of Trump support to people who are voting for Trump reluctantly they feel assaulted and so many never Trump has failed to hear the distinction between intelligent conservatives voting Trump is a last resort to stop hell and from cheerleaders we want Trump to be a bludgeon against the kuck servant of establishment meanwhile on the other hand a lot of reluctant Trump supporters have accused never Trump errs high-handedness they believe never Trump errs are sneering at them riding their high horses they refuse to acknowledge decent rationales either moral or political for not voting Trump the never Trump errs don't say never Trump errs are in the pay the pro Trump errs don't say never Trump are in the pay of international bankers or secretly pray at hillary shrines but they claim never Trump are whiners who won't get their hands dirty and simply want a virtue signal by refusing to vote for Trump this misattribution of motives on both sides is really much more likely to spell the death of the Republican Party then Trump himself or trumpism is after the election which Trump will probably lose most Republicans will grieve never Trump are gonna grieve at the lost opportunity to stop Hillary Clinton and at paving her way by nominating a man eminently unfit and pathologically incapable of running even a half-decent campaign that lament the damage done to the party by spending months snorting at sexual assault allegations and shrugging and playing footsie with the despicable alt-right reluctant Trump voters are also gonna be grieving they're gonna grieve at the Trump loss generally they'll lament both his win in the primaries he and his loss in the general but will generally acknowledge that he failed and he failed his supporters in doing so now that does provide the opportunity for a healing so long as both sides recognize the genuineness of the other side's grief never Trump errs have to acknowledge reluctant Trump voters felt they had to do what they did they don't bear the stain of his sins for taking the lesser of two evils path even if we think that was wrong reluctant Trump voters have to acknowledge never Trump errs we felt we had to do what we had to do not out of a misguided attempt to demonstrate moral superiority but out of a real abiding belief the only way to preserve conservatism and the Republican Party is to disassociate from the political electrical fire Trump represented no conservative or republican of decency we'll be celebrating on November 9th no one is gonna be popping the cork both never Trump errs and reluctant Trump voters should recognize this the only way to rebuild a Republican Party based on conservative principle is to acknowledge the good motivations of people who disagree about Trump there is a real possibility such a reproach Monteux not happen that's because Trump and his campaign they actually want the civil war they want us to fight each other they want reluctant trumpet voters to fight with never Trump errs they want to excise conservatives who wouldn't back Trump they want to co-opt the Conservatives who would that's why in the waning days of the campaign Trump is spending his time ripping on Paul Ryan a trump endorser by the way and blaming other Republicans for his own failures Trump's team including political arsonists like former and future Breitbart Chairman Steve ban and want the right to burn itself out making way for a resurgent nationalist populism that dispenses with constitutional conservatism altogether in favor of all right nonsense Trump has an act of rooting interest in initiating a civil war for about financial and political gain he's planning and promoting that civil war now to that end Trump himself Stokes the absolute line it is a lie the Republicans who won't vote for him our traders to conservatism hell-bent on belittling those who vote for Trump the only way to rebuild the Republican Party based on conservative principle is to acknowledge those good motives we all want to stop Hillary Clinton and her vile agenda we all want to reverse decades of democratic policy on immigration and government growth on social leftism and leftist race-baiting if Trump loses we'll have to get over our differences about him to do that we all had sincere positions on Trump it wasn't just preening it wasn't unheard moral superiority it wasn't virtue signaling we had serious disagreements but we still agree on basic principles if we can agree on all of that there's a future of concern for conservatism if Trump succeeds though in his post-election plan to divide conservatives between people who are loyal to him and people who weren't he'll have told his biggest lie and on the basis of that one his greatest victory the conservative movements collapse will be the final step in the political Armageddon that he and his advisers truly truly desire I'm

make your life a better place okay so here we go there's a lot going on in in Hillary land so there's a memo that broke and it just demonstrates that the Clinton Foundation is a giant giant giant scam always was a giant giant giant scam okay so here's the deal hacks memo from the Clinton Foundation it's from a guy named Doug ban Doug banned is a former Bill Clinton aide he started a group called 10 AIO with a couple of other former Bill Clinton aides and today Oh Bill Clinton's being paid like two million dollars a year about his firm it was a consulting firm and basically they were Bill Clinton Inc that's how they described themselves they would go to various corporations corporate clients and they would say to them I want you to give a hundred million dollars to the Clinton Foundation while you're at it which mine funneling a couple mil into bills pocket really that's what this memo says it says that tane o quote would ask and encourage our clients to contribute to the foundation independent of our fundraising and decision making activities on behalf of the foundation we have decided ourselves to help the president secure and engage in for-profit activities they called the operation Bill Clinton Inc they would even solicit in-kind services for the president and his family and his family includes the Secretary of State personal travel hospitality vacation and the like ban talks openly of what the Washington Post now calls a circle of enrichment in which he raised money for the Clinton Foundation from top tier corporations like Dow Chemical and coca-cola there were clients of his firm today Oh while pressuring many of the same donors to provide personal income to the former president and worked banned raised 8 million bucks for the foundation he created contracts worth 66 million dollars for the Clintons over the next nine years so as an example and he used the State Department as part of the payoff for example Tenaya brought together Clinton and the chief executive Dow Chemical guy named Andrew Liveris and he helped facilitate dows donation of millions to the Clinton Foundation and tens of millions to tane Oh simultaneously Hillary Clinton visited Northern Ireland as Secretary of State and thanked doubt for their creation of jobs in the country all right so that seems like a minor thing and this is the problem with the story is that there's no quote/unquote smoking gun now the ties between tane oh and the Clinton Foundation the State Department they all run really deep as we all know at this point Cheryl Mills who's Hillary's top hatchet woman she's her lawyer really really corrupt she worked heavily with the Clinton Foundation while she was at the State Department who may Abbott and worked at the State Department and she worked for Tenaya at the same time she worked to it quote they sure a presidential appointment for a supporter of the Clinton Foundation according to a chain of emails obtained by Politico Chelsea Clinton was upset enough by tanios infiltration of the Clinton Foundation that she ended up ripping on - no - John Podesta who is Hillary's current campaign chair and that led Doug ban is the head of today Oh to call Chelsea quote a spoiled rich brat who has nothing to do but create issues to justify what she's doing because she as she said has not found her way and has a lack of focus in her life so all of this is really bad stuff for the Clintons or would be if the Trump campaign were focused on explaining it now there is an advantage for the Clintons the Clintons number one know how to run a good scam operation right Trump foundation is not a good organization they don't do anything worthwhile the Clinton Foundation is a good scam operation so Tony Soprano owned a garbage come right he's said to have a waste disposal company they actually disposed of waste so that meant that if you looked at Tony Soprano you wouldn't see the gangsterism all you would see is a garbage company and then you'd go around saying the Mafia doesn't exist the Clinton Foundation is the same way they distribute a lot of money they take in a lot of money they do some good work because that's a front right just like Genco olive oil company was the it was the front for the the Corleone's the Clinton Foundation is the front for for Hillary's routine and meanwhile behind the scenes it's very complexity of tane o which is a private organization coordinating with the nonprofit the Clinton Foundation and both of them coordinating with the State Department's get favors and the thing is that the smoking guns when the smoking guns are not huge and that's part of the problem here too is that the favors that Hillary was granting to people are relatively small in the grand scheme of things it's not billion-dollar favors trillion-dollar favors it's the kind of thing where she thanks Dale chemical when she visits Northern Ireland or it's the kind of thing where the Clinton Foundation directs money to rebuilding in Haiti to Friends of Hillary Clinton's and Bill Clinton's with the approval of the State Department and it's like a ten million dollar contract and five million of it goes into somebody's pocket people don't tend to get too upset about this kind of stuff because they're not smoking guns as much as they are sort of smoking matches that's because Hillary's a pro at this and she knows how to play this game Hillary is a professional criminal bill is a professional criminal they've been doing this for twenty years and that means that the only way to uncover this is to really prosecute the case which means that the only person who's going to prosecute the case are the Republicans right that's the only way that you're going to be able to prosecute in this case so the media you know signal that are outraged but they're not really willing to go all the way in explaining what exactly is happening with these scandal so the Washington Post ran this story The Washington Post you know did did a full story on it but it's a long story it's a little bit complex it's a little hard to understand unless you're reading closely so what you end up with is the overall impression that Hillary is corrupt but then when you have people like Media Matters Hillary shills come out and try to pierce through that fog and say no no Hillary is it she never did anything wrong people don't know enough to rebut it right so for example Donald Trump in the second debate or actually in the third debate Donald Trump mentioned the Clinton Foundation and he just said what they did in Haiti it's unbeliev it's just terrible that they didn't hate he's right what they did in Haiti is really awful the Haitian people were jacked around by the Clinton Foundation again the Clinton Foundation greenlit the use of firms that were friendly to the Clintons and they built basically corrugated iron shacks that blew over at the first moment's notice people in Haiti hate that but Trump didn't explain what he means by that so most people go I don't know what happened in Haiti and because Trump only reads the headlines he didn't have the capacity to lay out all of the steps of what actually happened in full living color and that's why the media have focused so much on Trump scandals not only because they're corrupt they are not just as their leftist they are but because it's a lot easier to understand grab them by the bleep right Trump's campaign Trump's Trump's statement to Billy Bush than it is to understand the relationship between 10 AIO which is run by Clinton aides and the Clinton Foundation in the State Department and who did Huma Abedin work for was Ateneo was at the foundation was at the department who was Cheryl Mills working for a lot of bit players a lot of multiple conflicting threads that's because they're good at this right that's because they're they're hiding their ground work and that doesn't mean that they're innocent because they aren't they're super duper guilty they'll do this with the executive branch - they did it the first time they were in power but it should be a reminder of just how corrupt they're now the media are doing something I want you to pay attention to it because this is where the media you can tell the media think Trump is gonna lose because they're actually starting to cover Hillary scandals this is the way that this works when the media think Trump was gonna win all of a sudden the only thing that would cover is Trump now they think Trump's gonna lose so now they're going to create the the impression that they care about Clinton corruption so later when we say you never cared about Clinton corruption they say really look at all the stories we ran look at all the amazing stories right I mean and so this is this is what they're doing now Ron Fournier who Ron Fournier I think it works for National Journal and he is complaining about the the circle of enrichment I did that story the one you're talking about when it's when the scandal first broke in early 2015 and it was based on a person very close to the Clintons who I'd known for a long time who worked for the Clintons for a long time who was saying you know get into the motive of why she had a secret server and it was because of the circle liver enrichment the the phrase that the Washington Post pulled up today that was clear even that there was already some connections between dug band and you know shaking down donors at the time and this person was saying this is really about the foundation it's not about the email and more importantly gel unit you know for the next 18 months I wrote story after story basically begging the Clintons to stop taking foreign money to come clean with this email to turn the I turn over to the inspector general the secret server to stop lying about what went into this in for news coverage he has in fairness covered Hillary better than a lot of these other sources but what you're seeing is places like CNN which have basically ignored Hillary scandals in favor of trumps all the time now they're trying to cover their butts by claiming that they that they they're just offended they can't believe Hillary's corrupt again if you can't believe Hillary's corrupt it's because you haven't been watching closely enough so we will continue along these lines plus we have to get to the the Trump
