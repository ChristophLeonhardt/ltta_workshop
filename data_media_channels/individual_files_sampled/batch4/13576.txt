on Sunday he comes back and he does his sit-down with Jake Tapper and Jake this time does a really good job Jake grills him and Jake makes him look pretty bad this exchange is just astonishing Scott Israel they sheriff of Broward County explaining that actually in reality his leadership was just amazing his leadership was actually incredible Jake I could only take responsibility for what I knew about ie exercises my due diligence I've given amazing leadership to this agency leaders I've work yes Jake this is there's a lot of things we've done throughout this this is a you don't measure a person's leadership by a deputy not going into a these deputies receive the training they needed maybe imagine somebody's leadership whether or not they protect the community in this case you've listed 23 incidents before the shooting involving the shooter and still nothing was done to keep guns out of his hands to make sure that there were the school was protected to make sure you were keeping an eye on him your deputy actually got failed I don't understand how you can sit there and claim amazing leadership okay but Scott Israel did anyway I'm good for tapper for calling him on it's too bad that they didn't have this information before that Town Hall when Israel was allowed to rant and rave around the stage like a maniac lending everybody but himself Tapper went further than this he said are you really not taking any responsibility here he grilled Israel for suggesting that that everything was hunky-dory I hear his tapper going off on Scott Israel again deputies make mistakes police officers make mistakes we all make mistakes but it's not the responsibility of the general or the president if you have a deserter you look into this we're looking into this aggressively and we'll we'll take care of it and justice will be served are you really not taking any responsibility for the multiple red flags that were brought to the attention of the Broward Sheriff's Office about this shooter before the incident whether it was people near him close to him calling the police oh I got you no I mean really what the hell is he talking about when when Israel says this is like the president being responsible for a deserter no this is not like the president being responsible for a deserter there you have an entire of command and the deserter is punished in some cases with jail time and in in rare cases with actual death penalty in this case not only was there one deputy there there may have been four deputies there who did nothing and again there were dozens and dozens and dozens of warnings if there were dozens of warnings that there was an attack about to happen a specific morning not just a general warning specific warnings there was an attack about to happen on 9/11 and the President of the United States ignored morning after warning after warning after warning that was brought to him and all of his people did that and then the attack took place in 3,000 Americans died do you think that impeachment might be on the table the answer is yes a people were talking about how Bush was was neglectful of 9/11 based on one vague warning that airplanes might be used for terror attack at some points in the future one warning that I'm not even sure Bush saw at any point he was ripped up and down for that Israel's department was told dozens and dozens of times 45 separate times that the shooter the shooter himself called the police department basically said stop me and the police department didn't do anything and there's Israel claiming that there was nothing there what's even worse that Israel goes ahead and he says that he's heard reports before the Town Hall took place that his deputy did not charge into the fray hey here's Israel admitting that he went on national television and by omission lied to the American public repeatedly during that special and tried to misdirect attention away from himself this is I mean this guy is just a despicable human being here here he is did you know it then did you know it Wednesday night it was spoken about during that earlier during that day I'm not on a time line for TV or any news show we need to get it right we need to get it accurate we're talking about people's lives we're talking about a community so he'd heard before but he's trying to now talk about we're about people's lives in about the community how about this how about you go in front of the community and you go on bended knee and you ask their forgiveness for all of the the crappy job that you did here it is just an amazing thing that he says and it gets even worse it gets even worse because in just a second I'm gonna play you what Israel said when he was asked about what the department could have done differently because it truly is an amazing thing first okay so Israel is asked about when he knew that the deputies had not entered he's asked again by tapri and again he misdirects the question when did you find out the deputy peterson had not gone into the building how soon after the shooting did you know that oh not four days we uh how many investigators looked I'm not sure there he just didn't know it's just a mystery to him he can't remember that answer means that he knew before the townhall here's the one that was really making the rounds this particular response from Scott Israel if this guy has a job by the end of the week that is a blight on the state of govern the state of government in Florida and he can't be fired by brick Scott Brooks got the Florida governor he's a Republican who's coming for a lot of criticism from Israel has said that he wants a full investigation before he fires Israel there's probably not the worst move in the world considering that he doesn't want the partisan blowback he wants to be able to show case in point exactly how Israel screwed this thing up so that Israel can't claim it's a partisan hit but if Israel had any had any sort of moral fortitude at all he would step down obviously he does not and this quote shows that he does not look at this this is just astonishing so Israel has asked what he could have done differently and his answer is just it's mind-boggling is mind-boggling do you think that if the Broward Sheriff's Office had done things differently this shooting might not have happened listen if ifs and buts were candy and nuts you know Oh Jay Simpson would still be in the record books I don't know what that means dead people and there's a whole long list of things your department could have done differently how could listen that's what that's what after-action reports are that's for lessons learn reports all for if ifs and nuts were candies and buts well what what is even talking about what kind of what and tapper says there are 17 people dead I don't even know what you're talking about here what are you even saying and the answer is he doesn't know what he's saying because this is complete nonsense he's just saying random crap because this is what he's doing to avoid responsibility so finally he's asked if he's gonna resign and of course he answers no he's not gonna resign
