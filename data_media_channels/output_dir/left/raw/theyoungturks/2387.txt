1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,030
MARCO RUBIO DID SOMETHING THAT
IS ARGUABLY BRAVE.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,600
HE DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO
ATTEND A TOWN HALL WITH A

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,660
LOT OF THE SURVIVORS FROM THE
SHOOTING.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,170
WHEN HE AGREED TO DO THAT I WAS
BORDERLINE SHOCKED BECAUSE

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:20,460
HE IS TAKING $3.3 MILLION FROM
THE NRA.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:31,570
I DON'T KNOW IF HE DID IT OUT OF
ARROGANCE OR IF HE DID IT OUT OF

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,270
GOING INTO THE LIONS DEN?

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,610
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS MOTIVATION
WAS.

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,970
OTHERS WERE THERE, THE SHERIFF
WAS THERE.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:49,410
THE SHERIFF WAS IN FAVOR OF GUN
CONTROL.

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,130
CREDIT TO CNN FOR PUTTING IT
TOGETHER.

12
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,610
GOV.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,870
BILL NELSON WAS THERE.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,440
HE IS IN FAVOR OF GUN CONTROL.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,790
AND DANA FROM THE NRA ñ THAT DID
NOT GO WELL.

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,430
BUT SENDER MARCO RUBIO IS
CORRUPT.

17
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,110
HE HAS TAKEN NRA MONEY.

18
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,110
IMPOLITE TELEVISION CIRCLES
THEY NEVER SAY THAT HIS

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:27,570
CORRUPTION ALTHOUGH THE REST OF
US KNOW IT IS.

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,450
THE PROBLEM HERE IS IT IS NOT
TELEVISION ANCHORS WHO ARE

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,000
TRAINED NOT TO ASK HARD
QUESTIONS.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,590
IT IS ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO ARE
SURVIVORS OF THE SHOOTINGS.

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,010
SO THEY ARE GOING TO ASK
QUESTIONS.

24
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,940
I WANT TO GO TO THE STUDENT
MICHELLE.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:55,100
SHE WANTED TO ASK ñ THIS GIVES
YOU A SENSE OF THE ANGER THEY

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,280
HAVE ABOUT THE NRA AND OVERALL
THE MONEY THAT IS MAKING THIS

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,760
CRISIS POSSIBLE AS IT FLOWS INTO
THE POLITICIANS AND THEY

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,510
REFUSED TO PASS GUN-CONTROL
LAWS.

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,510
LET'S WATCH.

30
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:17,010
I HAD A QUESTION FOR ñ FOR
HER AND THE NRA, AND ALL OF YOU

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,069
PUPPET POLITICIANS THAT THEY ARE
BACKING, WAS THE BLOOD OF MY

32
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,510
CLASSMATES AND MY TEACHERS WORTH
YOUR BLOOD MONEY?

33
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,190
SEN.

34
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,620
NELSON YOU DON'T ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,570
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
QUESTION.

36
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,210
EXCUSE ME?

37
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,021
THE REASON WHY IS NOT GREAT
TIMING IS THAT NELSON IS A

38
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:48,110
DEMOCRAT WHO IS IN FAVOR OF GUN
CONTROL.

39
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,380
THE STUDENT SAID IT WAS MAINLY
FOR DANA FROM THE NRA.

40
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,520
BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT IF
MARCO RUBIO WAS ASKED THE

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,770
QUESTION BECAUSE HE DOES TAKE
MONEY FROM THE NRA AND DOES

42
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,770
DO THEIR BIDDING.

43
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,770
DON'T WORRY ANOTHER STUDENT
STEPPED UP AND ASKED THE

44
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,880
SAME THING MORE POLITELY BUT
VERY MUCH TO THE POINT.

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
SEN.

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,900
RUBIO, KENNY TO ME RIGHT
NOW THAT YOU WILL NOT ACCEPT A

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:29,370
SINGLE DONATION FROM THE NRA?

48
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:38,640
I WISH I COULD'VE SPOKEN THE
NRA LADY A QUESTION.

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,060
I WOULD ASK HER HOW SHE CAN LOOK
IN THE MIRROR CONSIDERING

50
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,581
THE FACT THAT SHE HAS CHILDREN,
BUT MAYBE SHE AVOIDS THOSE.

51
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:44,599
WHAT WAS THAT?

52
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,599
I DON'T FREAKING KNOW.

53
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,599
I

54
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:55,300
LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE
GET IN A ROOM WITH POLITICIANS.

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,450
THE ANCHORS NEVER ASK ABOUT THE
MONEY.

56
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,390
PEOPLE IN TELEVISION NEVER ASK
HEY, IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT

57
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,170
YOU TOOK MONEY FROM THE NRA AND
VOTED ON THEIR BEHALF.

58
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:13,390
IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE THE
REST OF US KNOW IT IS NOT A

59
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,610
COINCIDENCE.

60
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,069
FROM THE MOUTHS OF BABES, TAKES
A STUDENT WHO SUFFERED THIS

61
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,029
TRAGEDY TO ASK THE MOST OBVIOUS
QUESTION IN THE WORLD.

62
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,479
LET'S SEE HOW MARCO RUBIO TRIES
TO WIGGLE OUT OF IT.

63
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,010
NUMBER ONE, THE POSITIONS I
HOLD ON THESE ISSUES I HAVE

64
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,449
HELD SINCE THE DAY ENTERED
OFFICE IN THE CITY OF WEST

65
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,520
MIAMI AS AN OFFICIAL.

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,779
NUMBER TWO.

67
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,250
THE ANSWER IS PEOPLE BUY INTO MY
AGENDA.

68
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,069
AND I DO SUPPORT THE SECOND
AMENDMENT AND I ALSO

69
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,080
SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF YOU AND
EVERYONE HERE TO BE ABLE TO

70
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,669
GO TO SCHOOL AND BE SAFE.

71
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:45,330
AND I DO SUPPORT ANY LAW THAT
WOULD KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE

72
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,629
HANDS OF A DERANGED KILLER, AND
THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THE

73
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:56,410
THINGS THAT I HAVE STOOD FOR
INFO FOR DURING THAT TIME.

74
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,410
MORE NRA MONEY?

75
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,410
THAT
IS THE WRONG WAY TO LOOK ñ

76
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,309
THE ANSWER IS PEOPLE BUY INTO MY
AGENDA.

77
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:08,610
LISTEN, YOU CAN ASK THAT
QUESTION AND I CAN TELL YOU

78
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,749
THAT PEOPLE BUY INTO MY AGENDA.

79
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:16,309
I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU
GUYS HAVE ABOUT ñ

80
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:20,139
IN THE NAME OF 17 PEOPLE, YOU
CANNOT ASK THE NRA TO GET

81
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,879
THEIR MONEY OUT OF YOUR
CAMPAIGN?

82
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,740
I THINK IN THE NAME OF 17
PEOPLE I CAN PLEDGED TO YOU THAT

83
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,689
I WILL SUPPORT ANY LAW THAT WILL
PREVENT IT KILLER LIKE THIS FROM

84
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,350
GETTING THEIR HANDS ON ONE.

85
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,900
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ASK A
QUESTION AND I AM HERE TO TELL

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,189
YOU ñ

87
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:45,669
I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED ANYONE
WHO AGREES WITH MY AGENDA.

88
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,650
LET'S BREAK THAT DOWN.

89
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,340
NUMBER ONE HE SAYS THEY JUST
HAPPEN TO FIND ME AND THEY

90
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,340
SUPPORTED MY AGENDA.

91
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,879
THERE IS A TINY BIT OF TRUTH AND
THAT.

92
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,949
IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO WAS
GOING TO SUPPORT EVERYTHING A

93
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,650
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION WANTS
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THAT

94
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,889
PERSON AND THEN GIVE THEM
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNTIL

95
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,710
THEY WIN ELECTIONS.

96
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,650
AND YOU SWAP OUT THE GUY THAT
DOESN'T HAVE THE CORPORATE

97
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,599
MONEY AND YOU PUT HIM IN OFFICE.

98
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,220
IF YOU WANT A GUY LIKE MARCO
RUBIO WHO SAYS NO MATTER HOW

99
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,389
MANY MASSACRES HAPPEN ON MY
CITIZENS AND THEIR KIDS, I WILL

100
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,289
ALWAYS SUPPORT THE NRA AND THEIR
POSITION TO BUY WEAPONS.

101
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,750
THEN THE NRA WILL FIND YOU AND
GIVE YOU MILLIONS YOU CAN

102
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,440
WIN EVERY ELECTION.

103
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,460
IS MARCO RUBIO AWARE THAT HE
TOOK OVER $3 MILLION TO THE NRA?

104
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,259
MIGHT THAT AFFECT HIS VOTE?

105
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,600
OF
COURSE.

106
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,949
IS PREPOSTEROUS TO SAY
OTHERWISE.

107
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,629
I ASKED SEN.

108
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,529
JOE FROM WEST
VIRGINIA ABOUT ONE OF HIS TOP

109
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,529
DONORS.

110
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,349
THEY ARE POLLUTERS OF STREAMS
AND HE SPECIFICALLY VOTED

111
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:16,909
TO DEREGULATE POLLUTING STREAMS.

112
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,210
SO UNDER THE MARCO RUBIO
POLITICAL SPEECH SEN.

113
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,210
MANSION

114
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,150
WOULD SAY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOR
POLLUTING STREAMS.

115
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,759
JUST SO HAPPENS THAT A COMPANY
THAT POLLUTES STREAMS

116
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:43,899
HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY DONORS.

117
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,480
YES BY THE WAY THE NRA IS IN
FAVOR OF SELLING GUNS TO

118
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,059
THE MENTALLY ILL.

119
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:54,029
THEY HAVE ACTUALLY ASKED THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW

120
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:56,949
FOR MORE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE TO
HAVE GUNS AND THE TRUMP

121
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:02,129
ADMINISTRATION DID DO THEIR
BIDDING.

122
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,399
LET'S SAY HE WAS A TRULY
PRINCIPLED MAN.

123
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:11,649
HE COULD SAY YES TO THAT YOUNG
STUDENT THERE.

124
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:16,959
I WILL STILL VOTE WITH THE NRA
TO TAKE THEIR MONEY.

125
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,069
IN FACT A PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE
IN CALIFORNIA RUNNING

126
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:26,919
AGAINST DIANE FEINSTEIN SAYS SHE
TAKES NO PACK MONEY.

127
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,069
IF I VOTE THE UNIONS I DON'T
WANT ANYONE THINKING I AM

128
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,929
DOING IT FOR THE MONEY.

129
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:40,530
BUT MARCO RUBIO UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND 17 PEOPLE THAT

130
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,200
ARE HIS CITIZENS IN FLORIDA
DEAD, THERE IS NO WAY I WILL

131
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,800
KEEP THAT MONEY AND KEEP ON
TAKING THAT MONEY.

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,090
ONE MORE THING.

133
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,260
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

134
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,260
THEY FIND A WAY TO GET THE 
GUN

135
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,190
IN AMERICA BECAUSE WE HAVE

136
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,350
NO GUN-CONTROL.

137
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,310
LET ME SHOW YOU STATS AND I WILL
KEEP ON SHOWING YOU UNTIL HE

138
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,230
GETS THROUGH PEOPLE'S HEADS.

139
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,780
CONDUCT TOTALS IN AMERICA IN AN
AVERAGE YEAR IS THIS.

140
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,610
UNREAL.

141
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:25,970
I WILL SHOW YOU JAPAN'S NUMBERS
IN A SECOND FOR CONTEXT.

142
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,620
I KEEP ON SHOWING YOU THIS
BECAUSE IT IS ñ

143
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,261
THE COUNTRIES ON THE LOWER
LEFT, LOW AMOUNT OF GUNS, LOW

144
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:33,570
AMOUNT OF MASS SHOOTERS.

145
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,430
THE US ON THE RIGHT QUARTER.

146
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,280
THERE ARE JUST AS MANY PEOPLE
FOR PER CAPITA THAT ARE MENTALLY

147
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,090
ILL IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES.

148
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:55,400
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO
WEAPONS SO THERE ARE NOT AS

149
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,060
MANY MASS SHOOTINGS.

150
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:09,680
THAT BRINGS ME 
TO JAPAN.

151
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:25,510
IS IT BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS
PERFECT MENTAL HEALTH IN JAPAN

152
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,420
AND THERE ARE NO CRIMINALS?

153
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,630
NO.

154
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,710
IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET
GUNS.

155
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,640
IT IS NOT THAT COMPLICATED.

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,860
ONE MORE PIECE OF CONTEXT.

157
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:52,090
MORE GUNS EQUAL MORE GUN DEATHS.

158
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:58,350
EVERY LIE THAT COMES OUT OF
MARCO RUBIO'S MOUTH IS PAID

159
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,270
FOR BY THE NRA.

160
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,040
THEY KNOW THESE STATS AND THEY
NEVER TALK ABOUT THESE STATS

161
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,050
BECAUSE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO
ADMIT I AM DOING IT FOR THE

162
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,250
MONEY.

163
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,520
I WAS GOING TO SAY I SURE HOPE
THAT BLOOD MONEY IS WORTH IT.

164
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,870
BUT NO MATTER OF MONEY IS WORTH
THAT.

165
00:11:16,870 --> 00:00:00,000
THESE POLITICIANS ARE TRULY
CRAZY.
