yeah to get comfortable being uncomfortable and it was all about doing something that's stuck every day over a period of time when you keep on doing things you can physically merely handle more and more stress the more challenging the tasks the more rewarding the more alive that I felt at the time I thought I was operating at a pretty high level but you know my baseline was here but when you push yourself you raise your bar you raise your set point and once your set point is raised you really can't go back down so by constantly getting out of your comfort zone and pushing yourself you're raising your bar you're resetting your setpoint and then you're operating at a higher level so it's not like you just throw somebody into the cold water you slowly adapt them to the point where they can handle the stresses of of different things mentally so you want to keep raising that bar every single day by doing something that sucks you guys start small and then go big that's how you can kind of start handling things better
