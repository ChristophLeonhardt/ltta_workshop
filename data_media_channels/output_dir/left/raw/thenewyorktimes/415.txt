1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,610
I love you. I love you.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,780
This is Jerusalem. I call this Jerusalem.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,219
This is where â€” this is so peaceful.

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:20,229
I drink my tea. I come out here, 
me and my son,

5
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,180
we meditate, we catch a vibe.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,680
I feel like I'm just in a whole 
other country. You know what I'm saying?

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,270
See that waterfall on that pool? 
The sound of the water.

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,740
I think I'm on the ocean.

9
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,629
You noticed how the sun is shining on me?
Everywhere I walk the sun

10
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:53,440
is shining on me. When I walk, in the 
house, the sun is fighting through

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,920
the windows to make sure it shines on me.
All praise to the most high! Grateful.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,370
Look at this beautiful purple flowers.

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:14,290
I love you. I love you.

14
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,600
So beautiful man. Let me 
show you something.

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,140
You know when I drink my tea, 
you need lemon.

16
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,390
So I went and got a lemon tree.

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,180
I come out here every morning and eat
breakfast and lunch. Fire pit.

18
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,300
I catch a vibe always. 
Always catch a vibe.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,080
I love you. I love you.

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:00:00,000
The key is: Respect your mother.
Respect Mother Nature at all times.
