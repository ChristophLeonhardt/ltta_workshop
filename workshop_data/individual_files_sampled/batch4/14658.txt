Theresa May has said she wants to accelerate brexit and that she listened to Jacob Riis mark she probably could yesterday I reported about how the European Union is complaining that the negotiations with the UK over brexit just aren't quick enough and while I understand that the EU is being purposefully difficult another report I did yesterday was about how the EU is punishing the UK I think they're right about the UK's lack of progress I understand that the parliamentarians don't want it to happen in many cases they're constantly bickering about what breaks it means etc so it's not going well but now Teresa May is claiming that she wants to accelerate and intensify the UK's brexit negotiations after she publishes by the way the upcoming white paper which will lay how her vision or her government's vision of the UK's future relationship with the European Union the Express reported on this story and they said we can get 5 a.m. after a mammoth ten hours of negotiations at the EU summit the Prime Minister said she wants to see a similar response from other European leaders talking to journalists in Brussels she said on brexit I've been stressing that we want a deal that works for the UK and our European partners and if we work together we can support each other's prosperity and security EU leaders in the UK government were hoping that they would have completely agreed a deal by this November we are going to be publishing our white paper shortly and I want to see the negotiations accelerating and intensifying thereafter and all this is very easy to say it's just classic Theresa May talking points I want a good deal for the British people I braked it means breakfast we're gonna make a success of it all this day it's all talk it's a lot harder to actually do it as she announces that she actually wants to speed things up she's being given ultimatums in the background by senior Tory brexit ears so the Express also reported on a story that says that Theresa Mae's been given an ultimatum by for senior Tory breaks the tears and they said as the Prime Minister met with other European leaders yesterday in Brussels Jacob Riis MOG former cabinet ministers in Duncan Smith and Aaron Patterson and former brexit Minister David Jones said that the EU must be made to realize it will not get the thirty-nine billion pound divorce bill unless it changes its approach to the talks the tough line from the three most senior brexit ears on the Tauri backbenchers comes amid growing anger over the intransigence of brussels negotiators and their refusal to discuss anything until the northern island border issue is resolved specifically jacob riis mark said it is inconceivable that Parliament will vote to spend thirty nine billion pounds without a trade deal we want to pro quo for billions of creds and Jacob Riis mogees right isn't he thirty-nine billion quid hanging over us that's our negotiating point in tourism a isn't even using it it's just accepted that we're gonna be giving them it now he lies to reason May's solution is right before our eyes she can't even see and when these senior brags are tears tell her to use the thirty-nine billion as a negotiating point they're not trying to cause trouble they want to break sit to be a success they want to resume to make of a success of it so when they tell her to use it they're not causing trouble they're trying to help now imagine if Donald Trump went into this situation with 39 billion quid hanging over him he's gonna use that as a negotiating point and you know what it had worked so I hope to reason may would see that you know she could go into the European Union and tell them listen guys if you want your thirty nine billion quid given that we've already accepted we're gonna be giving it to them and you've got to play ball you've got to negotiate with me and you've got to give me more of what I want if she went in and did that and if she was the bloody difficult woman she claims to be then imagine the bracelet deals we will be getting if Teresa may wants to speed up negotiations she simply needs to negotiate better the behavior from the European Union surrounding negotiations is completely unacceptable with 1.5 million jobs in Germany depending on a good relationship between the UK and the EU with the many trading opportunities between the UK and the EU and the 39 billion quid hanging over the EU in divorce bill fees we know we have the upper hand if Teresa Mae wants to improve negotiations she can do it Tory ministers by the way when they tell her that the 39 billion quid is her negotiating tool and they tell her to consider walking away they're not causing trouble they're trying to help her if Teresa Mae wants to speed up brexit negotiations it's time for her to tell the EU that were willing to walk away a report that came out of a parliamentary committee earlier this week which outlined their ideas about how MP should be allowed to stop the prime minister from telling the EU that she wants to walk away tells us exactly what we need to know about our politicians they are working against us and they are working against brexit like her or loathe her it's time for mps and for voters to get behind teresa may on greg's it if she gets the support she needs and if she listens to the brexit e is in her own party and if she receives the support from the politicians in her government and in Parliament then dregs eat negotiations can speed up and we can make a success of it if you want to see more from me and the rest of
