AT LEAST 23 HOUSE SEATS FROM

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,175
REPUBLICANS TO TAKE CONTROL THAT

8
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:22,309

POSSIBILITIES FOR THE NOVEMBER

14
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:31,285
BALLOT.

15
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:31,986
CORRESPONDED PETER DOOCY IS IN

REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN

19
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:38,125
LEAPFROGGED.

20
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,728
>> THEY ARE CERTAINLY THE THIRD

21
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:41,262
MOST POPULAR GROUP.

22

PRIMARY CANDIDATES ADVANCE

25
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:47,968
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, THEY ARE

THERE ARE REGISTER G.O.P.

29
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:55,276
DEMOCRATS REMAIN IN FIRST PLACE.

30
00:00:55,276 --> 00:01:00,047
THAT MEANS TO WIN, REPUBLICAN

31
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:01,515
CANDIDATES MUST GET CREATIVE.

32
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:04,751
>> THEY DON'T NEED TO BE

33
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:06,520
DOCTRINE REPUBLICANS.

34
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,588
IT GIVES THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY.

35
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:11,358
THE ELECTORATE MAY BE MORE

36
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,527
MODERATE THAN A RED STATE

37
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:14,962
STRATEGY WOULD DICTATE.

38
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:16,931
>> ONE CANDIDATE THINKS BETTER

39
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:18,098
REGISTRATIONS WILL COME WITH

40
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:19,934
BETTER G.O.P. CAMPAIGNS.

41
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,268
>> YOU START WINNING, NOBODY

42
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:23,037
WANTS TO BE WITH THE PARTY BUT

43
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:23,337
LOSES.

44
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:24,238
>> DEMOCRATS WHEN THE MORE

45
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:27,141
STATEWIDE BUT THEIR STATS ARE

46
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:27,508
STAGNANT.

47
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:28,509
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS

48
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:29,877
HERE BECAUSE OUR NUMBERS HAVE

49
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:31,946
GROWN OVER THE 20 YEARS.

50
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:37,451
INSTEAD, WHAT HAPPENED IS PEOPLE

51
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,119
HAVE DECLINED TO STATE A

52
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:39,587
POLITICAL PARTY.

53
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:41,222
>> DESPITE THE DEMOCRAT LEAD,

54
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:44,725
COST MILLIONS TO COMPETE.

55
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:45,526
PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT GAVIN

00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:47,928
NEWSOM HAS SPENT ALMOST

57
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:49,363
$15 MILLION, ABOUT THREE TIMES

58
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:50,931
MORE THAN REPUBLICAN JOHN COX.

59
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,934
>> I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE.

60
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:54,735
FRONT RUNNERS TAKE THINGS FOR

61
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:56,370
GRANTED.

62
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,372
THEY READ THE -- MISREAD THE

63
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:01,742
POLES.

64
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,544
FOLKS DON'T TURN OUT BECAUSE

65
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:06,714
THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT IT.

66
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:07,781
>> THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL

67
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:08,549
CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE HAS PUMPED

68
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:11,018
MORE THAN $2 MILLION IN THE

ROHRABACHER'S DISTRICT.

75
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:21,362
DEMOCRATS MIGHT NOT EVEN FINISH

76
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:24,231
HIGH ENOUGH TO MAKE IT TO THE

77
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:24,598
MIDTERMS.

78
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:25,733
THAT'S WHERE DEMOCRATS HARLEY

79
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:26,500
RUDA IS APPEALING TO THIS NUMBER

80
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,970
IN THE MIDDLE TO AVOID BEING

81
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,939
LEFT OUT THE NOVEMBER BALLOT.

82
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:32,940
>> MOST AMERICANS ARE BETWEEN

83
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,775
THE 20-YARD LINES.

84
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:37,311
THEY ARE TIRED OF THE PARTISAN

85
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,746
POLITICS.

86
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:41,081
>> EACH PARTY HAS A MATH

87
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:41,749
PROBLEM.

88
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,150
REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE AS MANY

89
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,052
REGISTERED MEMBERS AS THEY WOULD

90
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:46,553
LIKE.

91
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:47,521
DEMOCRATS HAVE TOO MANY

92
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,155
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES

93
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,758
SPLITTING UP THE VOTE IN SOME

94
00:02:50,758 --> 00:02:51,125
DISTRICTS.

95
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,527
IT MAKES IT UNCERTAIN DEMOCRATIC

96
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,963
CANDIDATES WILL MAKE IT PAST

97
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:57,064
TONIGHT AND EVERY SINGLE

98
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:59,833
DISTRICT AND I COULD SPOIL THEIR
