last week ABC News broke a story regarding Scott Pruett who is the EPA chief and the fact that he had been renting a condo in a prime location in DC near Capitol Hill for a very small amount of money but it wasn't disclosed how much he was paying for that condo now a little digging indicated that he actually was only spending $50 a day for this 2-bedroom condo and the person who had rented that condo to him was working for a lobbying company known as Williams and Jensen okay in fact she is a big part of that lobbying firm and they Lobby specifically for oil companies and companies that extract natural gas and so obviously there's a little bit of a conflict of interest there and now we have a little bit more detail into what's going on first the ethical concerns apparently the EPA investigated this and found that there are no ethical concerns let me give you the details what a coincidence a memo signed by Kevin Manoli contends that Scott true it's $50 a night rental payments constitute a fair market rate no they don't and I'll tell you why in just a minute the memo was dated March 30th the day after ABC News first reported Pruitt lived last year in a condo co-owned by the wife of Stephen Hart a registered lobbyist whose firm pushed epi EPA to relaxed pollution regulations okay now by the way Scott Pruett not only met with these lobbyists he immediately took action and this is all happening while he's staying at this condo for $50 a night by the way they didn't charge him for the nights that he wasn't in the condo so they made a special exception for him and didn't even charge him for the nights that he didn't stay there but they did charge him $50 a night when he did stay there now Pruett has moved to scrap gut or replaced numerous environmental regulations opposed by the industry while boosting the continued burning of fossil fuels and by the way this lobbying firm specifically worked for an energy company the only energy company in the United States that produces liquefied natural gas okay now what did Pruitt do in regard to liquefied natural gas in October the EPA announced that it would rewrite the clean power plan the Obama era regulation that sought to limit planet warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants like those operated by OGE another company represented by this lobbying firm which paid hearts firm $400,000 in lobbying fees in 2017 also Pruett traveled all the way to Morocco and talked to some of the leaders there to convince them to import liquefied natural gas from the United States why no specifically liquefied natural gas another amazing coincidence look what I love about this story is that the negative news coverage about Pruett is piling on and it appears that Kelley and Trump have been in talks with him Trump has said that he has Pruitt's back which means Pruett is probably gonna get fired soon that's my speculation but I believe that we have some history to prove why I would have that kind of speculation now let me give you a few more details is that townhouse or that condo was it being rented to him for market value no it was not according to ABC I'm sorry the Associated Press the town home on a townhome on the same block as the one least by proof was advertised for rent on Monday for three thousand seven hundred fifty dollars a month another two-bedroom unit on the next block was advertised as available for four thousand seven hundred forty dollars a month based on how Pruitt was able to pay for the condo that he was staying in he was a paying an average of $1,000 a month so no he was not paying market value there's a clear mark clear conflict of interest here and it doesn't appear that the media is letting this go which i think is a good thing one of my favorite parts of the story is when they say no sorry you don't have to pay for the nights you're not there you guys ever rent to place do they ever tell you oh no but if you're away that's okay you don't have to pay the rent on those days it's insane yeah and so on the day that he went to go give speech in favor of liquefied natural gas in Morocco why you're the head of our our EPA what are you even doing in Morocco I mean if you were there for an environmental conference and figuring out how to protect the environment better okay but you're there to basically be a spokesperson for the company that is letting you have this condo at a ridiculously low rate the comment on that night they make sure that you don't pay the 50 bucks because you're away in Morocco that's right it's insane so again there are issues not only with the conflict of interest here but also with the fact that Prewitt just secured he took advantage of a loophole in the federal government to secure raises for two of his employees within the EPA and he increased their salaries to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars so there are people in the White House who are not too happy about that also political reported that Pruett has been scheming to take Jeff Sessions place as Attorney General and the reason why I tell you that is because it's relevant to how I think the media obtained information about Pruitt's condo situation because that's not public information this is a person the lobbyist right they own the condo so they're probably they don't have to make that information public they don't have to publicize how much they're renting it out for someone within the White House this is again my speculation knew about Pruitt's living situation didn't like what Pruett was up to by being maybe overly ambitious and maybe leaked it to the press Maliki leaked yeah I mean look they're running a reality show over there so it might be time for Pruitt to get voted off the island and and that's what they do on shows like survivor or parentheses that are a lot of back dealing and and Trump loves it he was a host of a reality show just like this so that's why this is always encouraged and and as Pruett got a little too ambitious all of a sudden a little shoe shoe ship now before they knew about the thousand dollar condo they should have been you know 3,500 to 4,000 seven hundred dollars they didn't care they didn't mind Pruitt's corruption and destruction of the EPA that's what they hired him for if every problem with that it's corruption 101 in the Trump White House I mean look at what they the firm who's corrupting him want him to do they wanted him to relax pollution regulations why would they want him to do that probably because they want to pollute that's why you don't want pollution regulations because you'd like to pollute so and they put it into the water in the air and that affects us but they privatized the profits they socialized the costs we all bear the costs but not Pruitt he gets a great apartment at a cheap rate but if you're going after another Trump guy what's the biggest problem in America you can rip off poor people in middle class people all day long but you touch anybody else in power then you're in trouble that's right and so it looks like Pruitt made that mistake got a little ahead of himself let's see how this winds up and I want to leave you with a quote from Trump who was asked by reporters about this Pruett situation and here is his supportive quote toward Pruett I hope he's going to be great oh he's done okay next week on Apprentice Pruett gets a rose or doesn't get one or however it works if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now ey tea network.com slash join get the
