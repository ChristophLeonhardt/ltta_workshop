10
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:18,948
IGNORANT.

11
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:20,049
WEST CALLS HIS STRUGGLE THE

00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:22,252
RIGHT TO BE A FREE-THINKER

13
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:24,387

00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:33,263
IGNORANT.

21
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:36,799
HERE TO WEIGH IN, CEO OF THE

22
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,067
BLACK SPHERE FOX NEWS

23
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:38,701
CONTRIBUTOR KEVIN JACKSON

24
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:39,736
JOINS US FROM PHOENIX.

25
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:41,037
KEVIN, THIS WAS QUITE AN

26
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:41,371
ARTICLE.

27
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,840
IT WAS LENGTHY IN VERY, VERY

28
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,140
LONG.

29
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,775
BUT HE MAKES SOME POINTS.

30
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,010
AND HE STARTS OUT TALKING

31
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,910
ABOUT HOW WHEN HE WAS

32
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,481
GROWING UP TO HIM MICHAEL

33
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,483
JACKSON WAS A GOD AND LATER

34
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:55,051
KANYE WEST WOULD BE A GOD

35
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:57,754
UNTIL THIS.

36
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:58,054
KEVIN?

37
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:59,422
>> OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE

38
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:00,456
RUNNING A CLIP.

39
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:02,158
WELL, LOOK, SO MICHAEL

40
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:03,893
JACKSON WAS A GOD UNTIL HE

41
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:05,361
DECIDED TO LIGHTEN HIS SKIN

42
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,563
AND TAKE ON WHITE FEATURES.

43
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:08,765
CORRECT?

44
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,033
AND THE GUY WROTE THE SONG

45
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:10,800
BLACK AND WHITE.

46
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,068
THE GUY WROTE THE SONG MAN

47
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,671
IN THE MIRROR OR SANG THE

48
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:15,538
SONGS, RATHER.

49
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:17,807
AND SO MICHAEL JACKSON WAS

50
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:18,474
ESSENTIALLY SAYING LET ME

51
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:20,143
GROW UP TO BE WHAT I WANT TO

52
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:20,476
BE.

53
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:21,611
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE

54
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,679
MICHAEL JACKSON PIECE OF IT,

55
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:25,448
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW MICHAEL'S

56
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:26,783
FATHER RIDICULED HIS NOSE.

57
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:28,885
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW

58
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:31,354
MICHAEL'S FATHER RIDICULED

59
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:32,422
MICHAEL'S SKIN COLOR.

60
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:33,656
MICHAEL COMES BY WHATEVER

61
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:34,824
THE PATHOLOGY YOU WANT TO

62
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:36,359
THINK ABOUT IT HONESTLY.

63
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,460
OF THE IDEA THAT MICHAEL

64
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,861
JACKSON, WHO IS ONE OF THE

65
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:39,962
BEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE

66
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:41,364
WORLD, CAN'T GROW UP TO BE

67
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,632
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO BE.

68
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:43,700
I FIND INTERESTING.

69
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,468
BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING,

70
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:45,768
STEVE.

71
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:47,103
NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE

72
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:50,640
WHITE COMMUNITY CARE WHAT

73
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,108
EMINEM HAS BECOME.

74
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:55,078
ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC HIP

75
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:56,746
HOP ARTISTS ON THE PLANET

76
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:57,947
AND NOBODY CARES.

77
00:01:57,947 --> 00:01:59,382
HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU THINK

78
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:01,250
WANT TO EMULATE LEBRON

79
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:01,551
JAMES?

80
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:02,852
HOW MANY WHITE KIDS WANTED

81
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:04,754
TO BE KOBE BRYANT OR MICHAEL

82
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:06,122
JORDAN OR THE BEST BASEBALL

83
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:07,623
PLAYER OR THE BEST WHATEVER?

84
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:12,362
YOU KNOW, WHY DID A COLOR

85
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,097
LIMITATION THEME ONLY FOR

86
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:14,497
BLACKS?

87
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:15,198
STEVE: HERE IS A LITTLE BIT

88
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:15,998
OF THE ARTICLE.

89
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,467
HE WRITES WEST'S THOUGHTS

90
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,334
ARE NOT ORIGINAL.

91
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,603
THEY ARE THE PROPAGANDA THAT

92
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:22,271
JUSTIFIES VOTER SUPPRESSION

93
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,040
AND FEEDS POLICE BRUTALITY

94
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,343
AND MINIMIZES THE MURDER OF

95
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:31,681
HEATHER HEYER.

96
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,383
>> AGAIN, MORE OF THE BLACK

97
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:33,816
LIVES MATTER.

98
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,585
COPS ARE HUNTING OUT BLACK

99
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:35,952
PEOPLE.

100
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:37,186
THE NONSENSE OF THE LEFT AND

101
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:38,121
PARTICULARLY THE LEFT IS

102
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:40,556
BLACKS WHO WANT PEOPLE TO

103
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,024
BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE BLACK

104
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,459
IN AMERICA, HAVE YOU NO

105
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:44,727
ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR

106
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:45,928
CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO BE

107
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,530
WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO BE.

108
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,866
AND HE POINTS TO TWO PEOPLE,

109
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:51,501
MICHAEL JACKSON AND KANYE

110
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,202
WEST WHO HAVE EFFECTIVELY

111
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:54,337
REACHED THE PINNACLE.

112
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:55,872
WHY NOT POINT TO BARACK

113
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,141
OBAMA AND TELL US ALL THAT

114
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,242
BARACK OBAMA COULDN'T BECOME

115
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:00,176
BECAUSE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY

116
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:01,210
WHERE HE IS AT.

117
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,179
IF HE REALLY WANTED TO DO A

118
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:04,180
DISSECTION OF THIS

119
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,381
PARTICULAR SUBJECT, BARACK

120
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,816
OBAMA IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE

121
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:08,184
OF IT.

122
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:08,951
STEVE: REAL QUICKLY, KEVIN,

123
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,920
WOULD HE HAVE HAD A PROBLEM

124
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,923
WITH COUNCIL YEA WEST IF

125
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:15,057
KANYE WEST SUPPORT YOU HAD

126
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:15,892
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.

127
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,894
>> OF COURSE NOT.

128
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:18,995
THAT'S WHAT THE

129
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:19,929
CONTRADICTION IS AS LONG AS

130
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:21,230
YOU SUPPORT THE POWERFUL

131
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,167
WHITE PERSON WHO HAS GOT THE

132
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,802
DEMOCRAT AFTER THEIR NAME,

133
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:26,202
YOU'RE FINE.

134
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:28,104
BUT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP,

135
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:29,172
AND IT'S BAD.

136
00:03:29,172 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOK, AT
