 love puppies yeah it's
definitely like a Dancy feel-good song
why you gotta be such a bitch kind of
song hey maybe there's a reason you just
want attention huh are you talking to I
want the girl group to answer this song
I'm definitely into the sound of it but
I wish that it was just lyrically more
fun for me
that's pretty damn lovely kind of
harking back to 50 is a girl group vibes
but with you know modern sounds and
would be great in a film I think this
would be like the beautiful peaceful
song playing well everybody's like
getting shot and flying back and covered
in blood
this is supercool
really good feel-good pocket that you
could keep dropping into meets like
performance art it's got acting in it
I like the theatricality and the
slithery ness of it this song would
probably make me think that I would be
able to kick somebody's ass when in real
life I actually couldn't
so I feel very at home in this kind of a
sound who's that ties to go ty Segall
from now yeah when I just listened to it
and I vibe to it if you told me it was a
band from the 60s I would believe you
psyched for more of that kind of vibe
and spirit to be brought into the modern
time so I think it's cool I mean you're
gonna sing like in a trippy way about
magic we are the magic
you
