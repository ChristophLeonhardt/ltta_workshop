former Lebanese Prime Minister now in Paris at president macrons invitation it follows his recent surprise resignation and speculation he'd been detained in Saudi Arabia on Friday president macron stressed he would welcome Hariri as the Lebanese leader Sheikh is I don't I will therefore welcome him with the owners due to prime minister who has indeed stepped down but whose resignation has not been recognized in his country since he has not yet been there I will welcome him here as Prime Minister nonetheless many see Lebanon as a battlefield for the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia the two regional leaders Saudi Arabia had long been a supporter of her areas of politician however Lebanon's president claimed Riyadh might have actually forced the prime minister to resign because it felt he hadn't done more to stand up to Hezbollah the group is of course backed by Iran and an influential political force in Lebanon our correspondent isa ali takes a look Beirut the Lebanese capital nicknamed the Riviera of the Middle East it's an oasis of calm in an often troubled region but that wasn't always the case the city was the center of a bloody civil war that raged from 1975 to 1990 it was fought along sectarian lines which are still present across the country today here outside the Holiday Inn Hotel the marks of that war are still visible thousands of men fought for control of a number of luxury hotels in this area the holes in the wall a testament to that fighting while here in Shahadah Street the Green Line marked the predominantly Muslim west of the city for the mostly Christian East today the story is very different many religious groups lived together and the country has enjoyed stability for the past 27 years but with the resignation of Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced live while he was in Saudi Arabia there are fears that some regional countries are trying to push the Lebanon back into civil strife to pressure the sheer political party Hezbollah Hezbollah's actions were considered as a declaration of war against Saudi Arabia by Lebanon and by the Lebanese party of the devil Saudi Arabia is trying to turn the Lebanese against one another they wants us to humiliate and fight one another I think the Saudi decided to escalate they want to take a very strong position against Hezbollah and they know in for fact that will this will cause instability in the country and they wanted somebody who can probably project forces or forces against against Hezbollah so it was like a coup by the Saudis but what did the Lebanese people think about the prospect of a return to the dark days of the civil war we were almost killed on the last war I remember everything there was no electricity no water we cannot survive another war I'm afraid there will be a civil war again but I hope that God will stop this from happening I am a Sunni Muslim but I have friends from all faiths Shia Druze and others we are all brothers we all continue to coexist peacefully sunni shia Maronite for us the most important thing that we are citizens of Lebanon may God grant that there will be no Civil War Lebanon is one of the few countries in the Middle East which has managed to maintain a balance between its many sectarian factions but that balance can be fragile who could be upset by certain regional powers choosing the country as a battleground for their own proxy wars II Sally artsy in Beirut Lebanon we discussed the ongoing situation in Lebanon in an exclusive interview with its top diplomat Leon that not a memo hey Alicia today we're facing another attempt at creating hotbeds of chaos and instability which in turn lead to terrorism what is happening in Lebanon follows the same scenario which is why it's necessary to finish this tour here in Russia Russia has fought most of all against radicalism and terrorism we want to discuss preventative measures with Moscow to ensure that we're not threatened Lebanon remains stable and we're able to fight terrorism there the under Lebanon is able to counter any threat we're ready for such a scenario but we strive to do everything possible to prevent this from happening and want to have good relations with Saudi Arabia we're still acting this way and we're not going to change this approach unless we're forced to act in self-defense we can follow such a constructive policy but we're not immune from hostile actions towards us we see this in the situation with mr. Hariri anyone can go to war with us but I still doubt that this will happen because the consequences would affect those who start a war of course Lebanon would suffer as well so we want to avoid war feel any country can take action against Hezbollah as the u.s. does although the Hezbollah leader has repeatedly said whoever wants to oppose us let them oppose us but leave Lebanon alone we do not want Lebanon to suffer because of us we believe that any punishment directed against all the Lebanese people will have consequences for those responsible and affect the entire region as well as Europe whoever decides to punish Lebanon should think carefully before making such a decision but everyone bears responsibility for their actions including has
