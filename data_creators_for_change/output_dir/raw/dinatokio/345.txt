maybe more ago and ever since then

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,590
everybody has been like reinventing them

105
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,939
making different ones etc etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're</font>

106
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:39,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of similar to the shower loofah</font>

107
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,009
thingies that um I made a while ago when

108
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">I got the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off another girl on</font>

109
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:50,479
YouTube and yeah to be honest with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

110
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,479
these are really good and they are from

111
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,680
a girl from a lady called Romina and she

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,560
is on facebook and she's selling the

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,729
match d online<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think she has a face</font>

114
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,199
book store where i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the link</font>

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and script usually I wear the smaller</font>

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,370
one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and the only</font>

117
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason I'm not wearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it now is just so</font>

118
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,479
I can show you guys but the big one is

119
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">also very handy if you are more of a big</font>

120
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:21,020
bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> size head the material is really</font>

121
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,759
great and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are really really</font>

122
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,770
stretchy and what I found with other

123
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,110
scrunchies is that when you go to double

124
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,419
them over twice they<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to snap on the</font>

125
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">insight and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she's material but</font>

126
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are really stretching and really</font>

127
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,909
really comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're quite</font>

128
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,050
tight as well so you actually don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

129
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,759
to wear your hair in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bubble and then</font>

130
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,319
put this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top you just tie your</font>

131
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,150
hair with this and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

132
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,400
really comfortable genuinely honestly

133
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,930
really comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wearing</font>

134
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,699
this one most of time and this one

135
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:47,750
sometimes i'll leave the link in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

136
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">description make sure you check it out</font>

137
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,110
very handy a lot better than flower

138
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,819
clips to be honest flower clips do leave

139
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,620
you in pain and always break and you

140
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,969
with flower clips you can't really like

141
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,159
rest your head on the chair on a train

142
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,750
and stuff because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like plastic but</font>

143
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,520
with these they<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like squish so you</font>

144
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,930
can't a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went and met</font>

154
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,310
is black with so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always such a dark</font>

155
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,740
top brown but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hair itself isn't</font>

156
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,440
thick so that the color isn't like a jet

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,890
black it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a gray brownie kind</font>

158
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,020
of color so one side is to think I'd

159
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,580
fill it in with brown and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the whole</font>

160
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,410
eyebrow would just be brown but the

161
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with that is when you go up</font>

162
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,740
close you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it doesn't</font>

163
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,620
look rainy so anyway the in a collection

164
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,960
girl she said get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> byline a pencil get</font>

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,700
your own gold eyebrow brush wet the

166
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,620
pencil and then just get the brush and

167
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,320
kind of just stroke it along here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

168
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,770
then use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fill in your eyebrows and</font>

169
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,780
she told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to try it in black so that's</font>

170
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,070
what I've been doing and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

171
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,690
results of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyebrows today I</font>

172
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,460
personally feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are lot need</font>

173
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,130
to and they look a lot more natural but

174
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,680
you know maybe they don't don't let me

175
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,380
know though I'd rather not know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

176

181
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,860
months now and for the first five months

182
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,170
I was just buying day travel cards to go

183
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,630
which is 55 60 a day so I was wasting a

184
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,600
lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> um to be honest with you go</font>

185

189
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,240
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> so doesn't really save me that much</font>

190
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,020
money but um you know it makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

matter because we're all girls so anyway

196
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,060
dry shampoo I know it's bit disgusting

197
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">really and it's a bit lame because you</font>

198

should just wash your<font color="#CCCCCC"> hair with shampoo</font>

199
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">but sometimes we'll ahi you just can't</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really honestly very</font>

218
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,399
handy and when it got these individual

219
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,100
lashes from Claire's accessories and

220
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,170
they're so good you just put them on

221
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,970
like with tweezers like that and from

222
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,560
the side you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fake lashes</font>

223
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,070
you can tell because the the layering is

224
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,690
like really obvious but with this one it

225
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,070
just literally goes oh it looks so

226
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,100
