1
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:06,845
>> IT DOES APPEAR, AS YOU SAY,

2
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:08,013
THE ORDEAL FOR PASTOR BRUNSON

3
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:11,583
IS OVER AFTER TWO YEARS UNDER

4
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:11,983
ARREST YEAR.

5
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,052
A YEAR AND A HALF IN JAIL AND A

6
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:15,920
HALF YEAR IN HOUSE ARREST WE

7
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,555
LEARNED ALTHOUGH BEING

8
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:18,523
CONVICTED OF TERROR CHARGES HAS

9
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:20,125
HAD THE TRAVEL BAN LIFTED,

10
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:21,292
HOUSE ARREST LIFTED AND CONTROL

11
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:22,761
ORDER LIFTED AND HE WAS

12
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,062
SENTENCED TO TIME SERVED.

13
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:25,163
THE PATH IS CLEAR FOR HIM TO

14
00:00:25,164 --> 00:00:30,235
RETURN TO THE U.S.

15
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:30,835
THE TRIAL WENT QUICKLY.

16
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:31,469
THEY HAD A FEW WITNESSES,

17
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,203
BRUNSON WAS ASKED TO SAY A FEW

18
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:32,504
WORDS.

19
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:33,271
HE SAID I AM INNOCENT, PLEASE

20
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:34,639
LET ME GO.

21
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,141
AND THEN A FEW HOURS LATER THE

22
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:37,676
JUDGE MADE THIS RULING.

23
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:39,377
THIS WOULD NEVER BE DECIDED IN

24
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:41,379
THE COURTHOUSE BEHIND ME.

25
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,014
IT WAS MORE POLITICAL TRIAL.

26
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:44,582
WE'VE HEARD HIM CALLED A PAWN

27
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,518
OF THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT.

28
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:50,689
HE WAS SENTENCED -- FACING 35

29
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,058
YEARS FOR TERROR AND ESPIONAGE

30
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:54,893
CHARGES CONNECTED TO THE FAILED

31
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:57,529
COUP WHO TOOK PLACE HERE.

32
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,864
PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS RIDICULOUS.

33
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:03,301
A PILLAR OF THE CHRISTIAN

34
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:04,436
COMMUNITY, GENTLE MAN AND USED

35
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:05,236
AS A PAWN.

36
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:06,771
NOW HE IS RELEASED.

37
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:07,472
WE'RE GETTING EVIDENCE

38
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:09,407
YESTERDAY IT CAME DOWN TO AN

39
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:11,309
AGREEMENT MADE YESTERDAY.

40
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,310
TURKEY HAS BEEN SUFFERING

41
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:14,379
FINANCIALLY AND THIS MAY NOW BE

42
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,580
PASTOR BRUNSON COMING BEHIND US

43
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,782
AND I'LL LET YOU SEE HIM.

44
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:22,020
THIS MAY BE THEM LEAVING THE

45
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:22,420
COURTHOUSE.

46
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,121
THE MILITARY CONVOY, THIS IS

47
00:01:23,122 --> 00:01:23,922
THE WAY HE CAME IN.

48
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,523
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET A

49
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:28,226
GLIMPSE OF HIM THROUGH THE

50
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:28,660
WINDOW HERE.

51
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:31,196
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT PERHAPS

52
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:32,564
WAS PASTOR BRUNSON ON HIS WAY

53
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:35,333
TO FREE DEVELOPMENT AS I SAID,

54
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:36,267
THIS HAS BEEN POLITICAL AND

55
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:38,369
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE IT A

56
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,038
CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO GET

57
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,239
UNLAWFULLY HELD AMERICANS FREE.

58
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,774
HERE TODAY IT APPEARS WE HAVE

59
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:44,275
ONE MORE COMING HOME AND GREAT

60
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:45,510
NEWS OUT OF TURKEY.

61
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,212
TO BE HONEST IT COULD HAVE GONE

62
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:48,613
EITHER WAY AS OF YESTERDAY.

63
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:50,682
HE HAD A COURT CASE FOUR MONTHS

64
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:52,550
AGO A JET WAITING TO TAKE HIM

65
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,719
HOME AND THE TWO COUNTRIES

66
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,186
COULD NOT AGREE.

67
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:56,054
TODAY IT APPEARS THAT HAS GONE

68
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:56,521
THROUGH.

69
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:57,922
WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF

70
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:58,423
THAT DEAL.

71
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:00,725
WE DO KNOW THAT TURKEY WANTED

72
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,360
RELIEF FROM SOME TARIFFS AND

73
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:02,727
SANCTIONS.

74
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,262
WE'LL WAIT TO FIND OUT ABOUT

75
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:04,562
THAT.

76
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:06,831
CERTAINLY TODAY A GREAT DAY.

77
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:07,966
ALTHOUGH SENTENCED TO TERROR

78
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,034
CHARGES HE IS ONLY HAVING TO DO

79
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:10,735
TIME SERVED.

80
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:12,871

CONTROL ORDER LIFTED.

83
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:16,174
PAVING THE WAY FOR A RETURN TO

84
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:16,808
THE U.S.

85
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:17,742
BACK TO YOU.

86
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:20,779
>> Jon: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

87
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,713
HIS HEALTH?

88
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:25,483
HE WAS IN A TURKISH PRISON BUT

89
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:26,251
WAS RELEASED SUPPOSEDLY FOR

90
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:27,986
HEALTH REASONS AND RELEASED

91
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:28,586

92
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:34,592
DO WE KNOW HOW HE IS DOING?

93
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:38,730
>> WELL, HE IS NOT IN ILL

94
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,397
HEALTH.

95
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:40,665
PEOPLE SAID HE WAS HOPEFUL HE

96
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,934
WOULD BE RELEASED TODAY.

97
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,569
HE WAS ANGRY AT SOME OF THE

98
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,937
CHARGES AND WITNESSES APPEARING

99
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,639
FROM NOWHERE TO ACCUSE HIM BUT

100
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,740
NO INDICATION HE IS IN BAD

101
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:49,207

104
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:56,881

105
00:02:56,882 --> 00:02:58,516
SHE HAD BEEN HELD UNDER ARREST

106
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,450
AT THE BEGINNING.

107
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,085
HE IS IN GOOD HEALTH.

108
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,387
A NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS ALLOWED

109
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:04,989

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,891
CERTAINLY FOR ALL INVOLVED A

111
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:09,360
GOOD DAY.
