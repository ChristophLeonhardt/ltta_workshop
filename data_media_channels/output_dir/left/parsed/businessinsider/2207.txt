this is Apple's new iPhone 5s it has a
special camera feature that lets you
shoot video at 120 frames per second
what does that mean it means slow motion
video
let's see how it works a camera swipe
over to slow-mo go like that
go now that we've shot our video we're
going to control which part shows up in
slow motion so when you view the video
you just take the slider and scan it
along to which part you want to be in
slo-mo and when you're adjusting the
video the parts with the wider gaps in
the middle that's the part that will
show up in slow motion and then hit play
