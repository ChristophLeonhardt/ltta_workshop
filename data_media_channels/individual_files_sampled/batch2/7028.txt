US homeland security chief Kirsten Nielsen the very person who's been enforcing Trump's zero-tolerance policy was enjoying a night out at a Mexican restaurant having a lovely dinner now the Metro DC Democratic Socialist saw that she was having a lovely dinner and they did what I believed was the right thing to do they disturbed her lovely dinner and so they protested Trump's zero tolerance policy and we have some video let's take a quick look yeah I'm torn on it no I love it I love it you know I get I get that civility made sense in a time when politics was very different we're in a completely different world now and I'm done playing patty-cakes while these people you know I mean think about it I mean she's out in public enjoying a lovely dinner while people's people are experiencing their children ripped away from them not knowing when they're gonna see them again no no you don't get to enjoy a nice lovely dinner I and before I would have said no it's not okay don't harass people I know that I wouldn't appreciate it but I also wouldn't be complicit or enforcing this type of policy remember Kirsten Nielsen was considering quitting her job because Trump in a meeting decided to tear her apart because at first she refused to enforce this policy and then she decided now I'm gonna tuck tail and I'm gonna do it even though I know that it's the wrong thing to do I love that they protested the way that they did she deserved it so and let me explain why I'm conflicted on it on the one hand the word civility is used in Washington to make sure that you that the elite and the establishment are not disturbed and they can start wars in Iraq and kill hundreds of thousand not millions of innocent civilians that's fine as long as long as you're not uncivil to the establishment and to the end to their club they can take away kids from their parents and hey those people aren't in our club right so I totally get that on the other hand we feel passionately about this the right way feels passionately about other issues and if we are constantly yelling at one another and it's gonna get ugly and it's gonna get there soon now on the third hand they're already there so the question is do you strike back or do you sit there and get run over in Charlottesville right and and in other places where they've chosen that path and they've done it over and over again and Project Veritas then goes and and you know does dr. tapes whether it's in the a core situation and they shut that whole organization down they used to help poor people get health care get legal services get the things they need now they don't they robbed that of some millions of people in America and they did it in in underhanded ways etc so I believe in fighting back super hard but politically so now they yell at Nielsen good when Bernie Sanders is president and then the right wing will start attacking them at dinner so it's it's not an easy situation and and I think that I think there without giving into the mainstream media's idea of civility which is bow your head don't do anything to fight back and without giving into the Democratic establishment idea of pretend to fight the Republicans and then surrender as soon as you possibly can I think there is a way to walked outline without getting into physical confrontations and this got to the edge of that so I do not believe in physical altercation so let me be clear about that I don't believe in putting your hands on anyone with that said though the left has been engaged in what they believe is a Community College Speech and Debate tournament when the right wing has been punching people in the face okay they're in an MMA match and so I'm done I'm done with you know playing patty-cakes no we need we need to fight back politically which yes we do we need to fight back politically we need to organize we need to do a better job with all that but I I think that it's important for the Trump administration to understand that they're not going to be able to destroy people's lives like this and then live this comfortable cushy life without fear of people striking back so let me add more to why I understand that and appreciate that frustration so if you came to Christian Nielsen's kids as Peter Fonda suggested today and took them away from her the whole world would explode the mainstream media would say oh my what have you done you touched her kids are you insane right and it would be absolutely right but we are doing that to people they just don't have power and to be fair the media has been covering that well they really have right so I get that there is a a power dynamic here that is not on an equal footing so if you do something like disturb someone this is dinner when they're in the establishment people get very upset you take away people's kids you know it it certainly doesn't have the same effect in this case again it's a kind of an unusual example because the media did cover it a lot right so so you can't say that they weren't outraged by it they were but I can give you many other instances kids being killed in the Gaza Strip birds no big deal at all right the media has been extremely complicit in that and yes and also you know strikes and yes our involvement in Yemen and I mentioned the drone strikes not just under you know the Trump administration but also under the Obama administration and how little play it got it wasn't even on anyone's radar but but there is still an imbalance in a couple of different ways if you said hey the Obama administration when they did the signature strikes and and they killed innocent civilians they should be lambasted for that the press would be like oh please right but if you yelled at Michelle Obama when she's having dinner the press would be way more outraged let's keep it real they would okay so I mean so it's it's a it's a tough issue look I would be outraged if I'm gonna be honest with you I would I don't know if I'd be outraged that's a strong word I would definitely raise an eyebrow if people were attacking Melania Trump in this way right because Melania Trump look I get it she tweeted something that was incredibly tone-deaf and and I get that but she is not implementing cruel policy that's what Kirsten Nielsen is doing I mean keel she's spineless she's spineless no some might argue well what is she supposed to do I mean Trump's the president this is her position she was gonna quit but she didn't want to quit she decided she had a choice to make there on that I hundred percent agree with you she she's not a innocent bystander she is the one executing these decisions as the head of Homeland Security and and she made that decision and so and why did she do it she did it for power and privilege that's right and so I'm not confused about that and finally I'll I'll add one last thing the the dinner that should have been disturbed but was not and by disturbed I don't mean again physically but I mean in terms of significant protests is the one that Trump was having on Tuesday night he attended a fundraiser in order to attend that fundraiser you had to give a hundred thousand dollars per person oh he's gonna drain the swamp so I'm gonna do him to drain the swamp a hundred thousand dollars per person to attend the dinner that is the definition of corruption they're literally sitting there in plain sight bribing him and we all go oh it's a campaign donations it's fine no there's no appearance of corruption no the reason we have all these hideous policies in the first place is because all of our politicians have been bought and they're buying them right in front of us so those are the fund raisers we should find and those are the ones that should have massive protest political protests all over them and if the guys in tuxes who paid I do declare $100,000 a piece the bribe our politicians are disturbed well that is a servants that I would be massively in favor of as long as you keep it
