the Senate Judiciary Committee has let everyone know that there will be a hearing on the Cavanaugh allegations on Monday next Monday and that is important we don't know details about whether or not Cavanaugh is gonna testify or Ford's gonna testify but we do know that both parties have agreed to answer any questions that the Senate Judiciary Committee might have about these attempted rape allegations that Ford has accused Cavanaugh of and this is important because remember the Judiciary Committee was set to vote on Cavanaugh's confirmation this week on September 20th but it appears that there will be a delay in that vote so they can make way for this hearing which will take place a week from now now there were some Republican senators who did call for a delay and I want to give them some credit first there was a Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and then bob corker of Tennessee both Republicans who are retiring at the end of their terms joined Democrats in urging a delay in the vote until the committee hears from Ford the panel was scheduled to vote on Thursday afternoon on Cavanaugh's nomination and as I mentioned it doesn't appear that that will happen now that there will be a hearing next Monday a couple of things here guys one is a flake is on the Judiciary Committee so without him they could not have gone forward anyway if he voted to not confirm or to not wrap up the proceedings the Republicans had no choice and he clearly indicated that he would not go forward so now that flake came out let alone corporate if they lose flake and quark around the overall vote let alone Murkowski and Collins they're toast he won't even get confirmed so now that they realized they can't just push this through as they were originally planning then that's why the hearings begin on Monday because they're like okay well then we got a hurry because if it lasts any longer we might not make it before the midterm elections so now that the couple of Republicans have forced their hand the rest of the Republicans are going okay then let's go let's go let's get them in right now right now get Cavanaugh and get in and let's try to wrap this thing up that's what you're seeing today exactly so to give you flakes statement he said I've made it clear that I'm not comfortable moving ahead with the vote on Thursday if we have not heard her side of the story or explored this further he continues to say for me we can't vote until we hear more and as Genk pointed he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee so it is important to have him on board also you know keep in mind that flake that just to be fair and full disclosure he has been a vocal opponent and critic of Donald Trump so that might be relevant to you I want to make sure you know about that also bob Corker said the following a delay would be best for all involved including the nominee if she does want to be heard she should do so promptly and if she does participate in this hearing next Monday then it would be pretty prompt so we'll see again we don't know for sure whether or not she's agreed to testifying on Monday so senator Collins is theoretically pro-choice so she has to pretend that somehow Kavanagh is not going to vote with the pro-life position which he probably will and he has been he's voted against abortion rights in the past as a judge so but even for those who are pro-life corker flake etc well they've got it it would have been interesting to see what they would have done if they didn't hate Trump okay and if Trump had not attacked them over and over again because all the other Republicans stood firm let's go let's go let's go let's get Cavanaugh in because we really need a prole in their view a pro-life justice right so we got a and they keep giving Trump credit because he got Gorsuch confirmed they say that's one of the best moments of his presidency I am gonna think it's not that hard to get somebody confirmed all you're gonna do is pick a Republican when the Republicans are in charge and just make sure that they didn't commit attempted rape earlier oops Trump couldn't even meet that bar anyway we'll see how it winds up but but now given how much Trump is antagonized flake and corker when you get to what they considered to be a close call because they do really want a pro-life justice on the Supreme Court they go nope let's hear her out yeah so that's Trump screwing himself by being as usual over-the-top antagonistic to people he might need later it's because he has no sense of politics or decorum or basically getting anything done right but also consider that even if flake and corker are vocal opponents or critics of Donald Trump they have voted along with his policy proposals and and basically do what he wants but in this case they're speaking out and I still commend them for it regardless of what their intentions are I think that they're still doing the right thing by the way Senators Murkowski and Collins also released a statement about this Murkowski saying I think that might be something they might have to consider meaning postponing the vote at least having that discussion this is not something that came up during the hearings the hearings are now over and if there is real substance to this it demands a response that may be something the committee needs to look into and Collins also said I want to have both individuals come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify under oath both individuals have agreed to do that it just remains to be seen whether or not they're planning on doing it this coming Monday so those comments were before the news broke just a little while ago that the hearings are going to pick back up next Monday but it's because of those comments that that happened okay and then one more from orrin hatch who was firmly on Cavanaugh side him says he believes him but he says if that were true Ford's allegations I think it would be hard for senators not to consider who he is today so even hatch saying well if it's true that's not a good news right and hatch so far has been defending Cavanaugh pretty aggressively yes very much so yeah one other part of this story that is in my opinion important last Friday there was a letter released that was signed by about sixty five women who Cavanaugh who have known him throughout the years and who supported Cavanaugh and his character they were vouching for him well today there are individuals who have known the accuser Kristine Ford and they are sticking by her side and they have some allegations of their own that I think are interesting not in regard to Cavanaugh but I do want you to hear their statements now this letter that was signed by women who have gone to school with Ford's say the following we believe dr. Blasi Ford and are grateful that she came forward to tell her story it demands a thorough and independent investigation before the Senate can reasonably vote on Brett Cavanaugh's nomination to a lifetime seat on the nation's highest court this is the part that stood out to me they also write many of us are survivors ourselves the letter had received three dozen additional signatures as of Monday morning just to be absolutely clear they're not referring to Cavanaugh and in specific in being survivors so this is partly to counter the Republicans letter that came out a day after the allegations where they had 65 women and by the way I should correct the record on this I when we were discussing and I said I thought those were women that knew Cavanaugh all throughout his career no those are 65 women that knew him back in high school till now spending that thirty five years so they did all known from high school they apparently get the Republic's claim they got that those signatures within 24 hours that seems totally unbelievable so and I think Anna made a terrific point about that on Friday so how did the Republicans get this letter all ready to go to defend Cavanaugh they didn't know about the charges that now a lot of people have made that point but Anna added on top remember when Mitch McConnell warned Trump don't pick count-out don't prick him and he said it was because there was too much of a document trail too many documents that's what Mitch McConnell was worried about yeah perhaps there were some Republican senators already knew about this had the letter prepared and that's why they were telling Trump don't do it could trump by the way having heard allegations think what's the big deal I've been accused of the of similar things and move forward anyway now that's we don't know yet but it is curious that McConnell gave that warning and it is curious that they had their letter ready to go immediately absolutely and and also keep in mind that the paper trail or the documentation regarding Cavanaugh's decisions and rulings in the past it was just par for the course when it comes to a conservative judge there was nothing that really stood out during the confirmation hearings that would convince Republican senators to vote against Kavanagh so I remember during those confirmation hearings I'm like Oh something really bad is gonna come out and nothing came out from those documents I mean nothing that would upset Republican senators of course stuff came out that would upset progressives or left-leaning lawmakers but overall it was to be expected the stuff that came out was to be expected so I don't know look this is obviously my speculation but I feel like McConnell was worried about these allegations that did come out no it's a really good point it could be that McConnell was worried that it would take too long and now it is taking too long but not because of the documents but it is also possible that McConnell thought look I got 51 votes and they're locked in I don't have to worry about anything unless it's something so bad that the Republicans would have to vote against them and and so him his warnings to trump are at a bare minimum relevant and should be investigated as to what Republican senators knew before these allegations came out like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young Turks
