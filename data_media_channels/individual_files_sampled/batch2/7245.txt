report indicating that there's some concern that the US could engage with war with China engage in war with China now the Pentagon has expressed concern that China's military is probably training to strike the United States and its allies so that's something to be a little concerned about as we know there's an ongoing trade war with China Trump has been antagonizing China since before he even got elected but there's also the issue of Taiwan which we will get to in just a second but according to the report over the last three years the PLA also known as China's People's Liberation Army has rapidly expanded its overwater bomber operating areas gaining experience in critical maritime regions and likely training for strikes against the US and Allied targets so again this is an annual report that the Pentagon puts out it seems a little hyperbolic to me I'm gonna be honest with you guys but in the Trump era anything's possible and this should concern us the PLA may continue to extend its operations beyond the first island chain demonstrating the capability of us to strike the US and Allied forces and military bases in the western Pacific Ocean including Guam so again relations with the United States and China have deteriorated as of late in fact according to the report these relations have been tested and the cracks started to show in May when the Pentagon withdrew an invitation for China to participate in multinational naval exercises okay I'm gonna clarify what's important not important here what's real what's not real so don't worry I got this but before that I like to make really serious stories like world war silly so there's a bunch of cool things in this to cool names in this story now I'm gonna get a lot of trouble the right we can get ready to clip this out of context China's People's Liberation I on it are be sounds kind of cool like any Liberation Army sounds kind of cool to me now their actions were not that cool I just want to be super super clear about that but remember it was like when George HW Bush declared the liberation of Kuwait has begun now back then I was a Republican and I enjoy that kind of talk I've got a tough guy talk I like alright we're moving on later I'm gonna get the Corvettes and frigates which is also super cool now on to serious though alright so are we going to war with China very very unlikely but but there's a huge but here okay China is not making noises to go attack America that's insanity that's not gonna happen right but what could happen which could lead to either a shout-out war or a gigantic war is they just go take Taiwan they just grab it seems like they they're thinking about doing that yeah yeah and so I want to give you one other little piece of information this was the only thing that really concerned me worrying me in in this report so they're also testing a certain weapon that would be disastrous okay so China's testing something known as a hypersonic missile that could be developed to carry a nuclear warhead that can evade all current US detecting systems and also travel up to six times the speed of sound that made me feel better because that sounded like typical Pentagon overstating give me bigger budget right they're coming at hypersonic missiles I need to you know spend at least four times as much on defense contractors what we have been I know I know that's the point they already got what they wanted with the spending but and they also talked about how China is developing their military space capabilities so balance out the hype here which is oh my god the Chinese are coming we got to spend more on defense we already do we already spend a three time more than three times what they spent on defense then they spend a lot they spend a hundred ninety billion dollars last year and we're at over seven hundred billion dollars that we spend okay now let's talk about the only thing that I think is real which is could they take Taiwan they could in a matter of hours and so when I was in Taiwan I talked to someone that was in the Taiwanese military cuz I have a lot of deeply connected sources uh no it's just some random dude who was there they all have to be in the military okay and but this was super interesting they say that they all of their training centered around eight hours why eight hours because that's how long they have to last before America comes hmm that is what the Taiwanese military trains for but now what if America doesn't come that sounds like a really bad preparation tactic like let's let's do better well they have no chance so that leads me to the frigates so there's a breakdown here of the military of the of China versus Taiwan aircraft carriers China has one Taiwan does not frigates Hayti one's got 22 China has 51 Corvettes China is 28 Taiwan is zero which is weird cuz I can get you twenty eight Corvettes probably a different Corvette medium landing ships China is 23 Taiwan has zero they don't even have medium landing ships let alone big ones and here's the one that I thought was perhaps determinate of nuclear attack submarines Taiwan zero China five hmm okay this thing's over in under eight hours okay now they're not gonna launch a nukes on Taiwan that would be counterproductive but they can go and take that island no question is and everybody knows that Taiwan knows it in fact Taiwan's former leader said that Beijing should stop threatening Taiwan this is their ex-premier because it's not strong enough to fight the United States even their former leaders like no no it ain't about us the u.s. is gonna find it for us now any US president would fight that fight because we have a deal with Taiwan and we honor our deals except we have a president who famously does not honor deals doesn't honor deals in his personal life and he doesn't and he has said about how you might not honor deals with our allies whether it's NATO or anyone else are you sure that if Taiwan says they're coming we only have eight hours left that Trump says well I mean what did they do for us what a day do they pay their bills what did they do do it they are was $2.50 I don't know no water go hey right well sorry just let me quickly preface this by saying that Trump is likely or unlikely to do anything like exactly you can never predict him but I feel like if if China if he views China as his enemy then he will view Taiwan as his friend right so who knows I think it really did wonder hand he is a crooked deal with China for Zeon ZTE yeah that's true I don't know look my point is you shouldn't rely on Trump ever so my point is based on money so how can how can this be beneficial monetarily if you're gonna engage with China over potentially taking over and just snatching Taiwan how does that work out so we can demonize North Korea we can demonize Iran Iraq anybody we need to make some money off of so if we're gonna fight a war it has to be beneficial monetarily to us that's the key that has to happen before this can even go down which I don't see yet so that's the part of that they may be hard to sell to people thinking well remember those scary Chinese we only scare to the Chinese financially there could be bigger than us are they gonna be deemed in the world as stronger than us and creating more things than us so we have our egos bruised or or where they actually are we actually afraid of that kind of Asian person are we afraid of the other kind that we just made best friends with because now they're not scared because now he's Donald Trump's buddy yeah let me just say there's such it's a really great book because think about it psychologically you go to the magnet guys you say Iran has taken something or attacked us or intact an ally well we're gonna war immediately right scary Muslims China's taking something right we're having a conversation and that conversation ends in eight hours so well first of all the eight hours think it's funny to me it sounds like it's Chuck Norris movie you know there's like the beginning it happens that the clocks tickin and Chuck's got to come and just hide in the bunker is off the bat that's what I thought of secondly I would say that you know I I agree with what enna was say in the beginning which is it does seem like the Pentagon just wants more money as well and all that stuff of like they're coming at the speed of sound they got a they got an Iron Man coming at us you know whatever that is and it's it's like the police departments saying we need more guns so just you know spend you use that money right so you've got to be a little bit skeptical of the Pentagon that said the problem with the era were living in right now with Trump is when you hear things like this and what you guys were just saying he's so mercurial with who is he going to support what's he gonna support to the point where I keep pointing this out when when that thing happened in Hawaii where the where the they thought that North Korea was launching missiles at Hawaii people in Hawaii actually believe that and the reason underlying reason is because Trump is president if trumpet not been president you heard that you go oh that's just a false alarm whether it was under Obama or bullshit or wherever you go that's just fun but we live in an era right now where this could happen because dumb-dumb does something wrong and pushes the wrong button you were talking about Iran in the source so that one of the things they say in the article is how China is saying yo we're still gonna do business with Iran right and come November and the oil embargo we're gonna buy oil from Iran and Trump has said you're either with us or you're against us we're gonna put oil embargos on you so what's not I mean this chess game that's being played with our with our guy in the White House playing checkers or not even checkers I don't know he's flipping a coin that's what he's doing yeah you know and also I love that you brought up you know the whole Iran nuclear deal and you know the sanctions against Iran because this conflict with China isn't one thing right it's multifaceted you have the trade war that's currently going on we have a funny video to show you about that believe it or not you have the issue of Taiwan and then you have the issue of China essentially giving Trump the middle finger and saying no we're still going to import oil from Iran we're not gonna listen to you right so who knows how Trump is gonna act but there are all these different factors and any one of them can blow up at any moment and no pun intended okay so with that said Trump release this random video today and I think it has everything to do with China and the ongoing trade war with China he posted this on Twitter and there was a part of it that I found hilarious so I just wanted to share it with you let's take a look made in America is back now some people would say made in the USA I personally don't care the fact is we're back we have 400,000 new manufacturing jobs our opponents said that could never happen it has happened and we're going to develop a lot more in a very short period of time so made in the USA made in America it's back I just why-why-why the random tangent about some people would also say what you should have ended with and Merry Christmas that's back to Santa's back he's white and we're moving on you know other people didn't believe he was white but he made him white again he cannot but when he's given something to say and he's actually not even sure why he was given that to say he's obvious has to read something this is a Twitter account right there's no way he said you know today I'm gonna put out a video talking about made in America or USA it doesn't matter what see what's that once that is written he has to think of a insert he's like I gotta make it me I gotta make it my own so he has to insert something no matter how meaningless it is it's me yes - it's meaningless to everyone else but in his head it's like he thinks he's saying something smart right you know some people also say made in America or made in the USA we know we know the people let's move on no no you're absolutely right I mean this is a guy who thought he invented the word fake not kidding he said that interview he said nobody was saying that before now III you know I I said fake and now everybody's saying I think language alright last thing guys the thing that is most likely China attacking us a 0% chance China taking Taiwan is a small percentage chance but with Trump a little worried right the thing that's actually going to happen is what Moz said which is we're going into these terror trade wars that and because China has said definitively that they will trade with Iran they're gonna get secondary sanctions from America and those actually do hurt now right now their economy is booming even though Trump says oh they were very hurt by what the my tariffs no they weren't there GDP grew by 6.6 percent and they're like well that's down from six point nine six one six is gigantic they're growing at a huge rate so they're growing Bigley so they're totally fine but when you do say secondary sanctions they are going to strike back again and we're the ones that are on the hook our economy is in much more perilous shape because we have an inflated stock market that bubble is gonna burst any second I'm telling you right now man that Trump with these tariffs and sanctions is playing with fire and that's about the economy and it is gonna blow up on them it's in every day gets closer and closer and these markets keep gambling and gambling and at some point that bubble is gonna burst and I think that we are really closing this thing the part about how we gave the richest and also the large corporations a huge tax break that's gonna save us I'm not an economist but I'm just wondering who's in the room with him cuz when I heard that get you know when Gary Collins stepped down and then he was he wrote something about these tariffs and saying these tariffs are not a good idea and and he to me is somebody who's you know pretty well-versed on economics a lot of people that I've talked to they go yes the the Chinese do cheat us in many ways and there is something there's an argument to be made about the terrace but my question becomes where we had is Trump just sitting there throwing the stuff out is it is it his advisor and advisor there is there some economic theory behind it cuz I know personally I know personally that I sorta got listen we're getting ready to possibly do some some work on the house and we were talking to an architect and stuff and she said oh the prices of every everything's gone up all that aluminum's gone up everything she goes everything's gonna be more expensive Washington buying a dryer everything's gonna be more expensive so we are being affected yeah right so there is no mas you're hilarious dude no wonder you're a comedian an economic theory in the same sentence he is incapable of anything read let alone economic theory and to your point earlier there was a battle about with Gary Cohen was his top economic adviser in my opinion bad guy done a lot of bad things at Goldman Sachs but incredibly smart right and knows the economy understands it and Steve Bennett who was like me do tariff me get vote base right so now they're both gone and he's home alone yeah and so god knows if he's gonna throw the paint thing at the intruder or god phone guess his own head he couldn't find an economic theory if his life depended on it is his home alone three you're right this is we are living through a home alone three right now two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then
